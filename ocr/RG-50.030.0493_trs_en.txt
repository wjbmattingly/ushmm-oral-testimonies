Question:  Good morning, George. 
 

Answer:  Good morning. 

 

Q:  It™s lovely to see you. 

 

A:  It™s good to be here. 

 

Q:  George, tell me  when you were born. 

 

A:  I was born in 1931 in Libau, Latvia. 

 

Q:  And, what was the actual date Œ the month and the day? 

 

A:  Nove mber the 25
th
. 
 

Q:  You have to think about it. 

 

A:  It™s a few days ago. 

 

Q:  Right, in Libau? 

 
A:  In Libau?  In the Latv
ian, it would be Liepaja. 
 

Q:  And, how do you pronounce it? 

 

A:  Liapia. 

 

Q:  Liapia. 

 

A:  And in Russian it™s _____. 

 

Q:  So, it™s very complicated. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  With the changeovers. And, let me ask you some questions about your family, a little 
bit. Your father was a doctor. 
 

A:  Yes, he was a gastroenterologist. 

 

Q:  And, his name ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493

A:  Jacob, ____ Jacob Aaron Schwab. 

 

Q:  And, was that unusual to be Jewish and 
to be a doctor in La
tvia at that time ?  
 

A:  Well, he studied- 

 

Q:  _____. 

 

A:  He studied me dicine before World War I.
 He began his studies in Estonia, Dorpat, 
which was a very, very famous German univers
ity in Estonia, Dorp
at, taught to in the 
Estonian. It™s still in existe
nce today, and for Œ then he st
udied also for a seme ster at 
Konigsberg University, and from Œ he sp
ecialized in Berlin for three years, 
Gastroenterology, and he returned then to
 Latvia in 1911 and opened his practice. 
And, during World Wa r I, he was conscripte
d to the Czarist Army
 with a title of 
Colonel, rank of Colonel because of his prof
ession, that being a gastroenterologist  in 
the Army. 
 

Q:  Now, I know you™re born in 1931, and 
you in fact, don™t know your father for a 
hugely long time. Do you reme mber him as 
a kid and what sort of relationship you 
had? 
 

A:  Oh, yes. Oh, yes.  

 

Q:  Tell me  about it. 

 
A:  He was a softy. 
 

Q:  Yes? 

 

A:  But, my mot her, she was a strict one. W
ith him, I  could get away with things, but not 
so easily with my mother. I have very f
ond me mo ries of him. Sundays, we usually 
used to go out to a restaurant, my older br
other, my mother, my father and I, and I 

always ordered the same  thing. 
 

Q:  As your dad? 

 

A:  Yes, well, we all ordered what we calle
d Œ it was Latvian version of a Chateau Brion, 
but completely different from what a Chateau
 Brion means over here or in France. It 
was a Latvian version of Chateau Brion. In
 summers, we spent some time at the 
beach together and we were at the Riga 
beaches, father came to visit. So, no, no, I 
have a fond and very warm me
mories of my father, yes. 
 

Q:  Tell me  a little bit about your
 mother. Then, I™ll go back to- 
 

A:  Well, my mother- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
3 
 
 
Q:  Her name ?  

 

A:  Clara, Clara Jacobson Schwab. My moth
er was a wonderful, w
onderful person, but in 
contrast to my father, she was very, very 
strict in the upbringing and well, let™s say, 
my father would say to my mother some times
 I would hear him say, ﬁ Well, just leave 
him alone.ﬂ He™d said. So, she would 
say, ﬁNo, no, no, he has to be taught his 

ma nners, this and that, so on and so forth.ﬂ 
But, I Œ also wonderful. We ll, I wouldn™t 
say wonderful, but strict gove
rnesses particularly a Germ
an governess who taught me  
a lot which I didn™t like becau
se I liked to rebel.   
 

Q:  Do you get that from you fath
er a little bit,
 the rebellion? 
 

A:  No, I think it™s more my personality, 
but I don™t think neither my father nor my 
mother were rebellious types, no, no, and al
so not my brother, but I was Œ I was a 
talkaton. I could talk non-stop, and my mother
 used to tease me that I have her big 
ears because I listened to things I™m not 
supposed to listen to because everything 
interested me.  So, on my days with my
 mother, which was usually Wednesday, I 
could determine what she would wear, and we
 would go and I would 
go to with her to 
my favorite cafes and I would pretend th
at I was drawing doing some thing, but I 
would overhear what my mother was talking 
with her girlfriends. So, the gossip in 
town, et cetera, but I didn™t
 understand much of it, but- 
 

Q:  But, you took it in. 

 

A:  But, I took everythi ng in because ev
erything was I found very interesting, very 
fascinating. 
 

Q:  So, old would you have been when sh
e took you on her little 
trips to the café? 
 

A:  Oh, it started rather ea
rly because I would say about 
five, started five, six, seven, 
eight, ni ne, yes because  I also refu
sed to eat for a while at home . 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yes, and it was a problem, but by that ti
me  I mu st™ve been about six or seven, and I 
had an aunt who came from Riga, who had 
recently left Vienna, after Hitler. Yeah, 
actually, it must™ve been alre
ady ™38 after the Anschluss in
 ™38. I must™ve been about 
eight. She came  especially from Riga after comi ng back from Vienna to Riga, she 

came especially to Libau. She said sh
e is going to make from me Viennese 
sandwiches, and anything along those lines 
was of interest to me , and when she 
served me  on the little piece of bread, piece 
of Wienersc hnitzel or whatever, I said, 
ﬁ Well, I know what this is. It doesn™t in
terest me .ﬂ So, finally, my mother asked, 
ﬁ What would interest you? ﬂ And, I said, ﬁI 
would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and 
eat over there.ﬂ That was a hotel in Libau, 
and had also a beautiful restaurant, also 
was private rooms, et cetera,
 and she would take me  ther
e late in the afternoon about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
4 
 
five, five-thirty or six, and I would always 
have my cocoa there, hot chocolate, and 
little sandwiches with hard 
boiled egg on top of it, a small piece of toma to, and 
anchovies, and whatever I Œ whenever I woul
d get it I would sort of put it into the 
cocoa, into the hot chocol ate and eat it. 
It was what I loved, but everything Œ with 
anchovies with everything. Some  people complained actually, and the ma nager of the 

hotel came  a nd said to my mother, ﬁMrs. Dr. Schwabﬂ, that™s the way we used to 

address people, ﬁThere™s some  people w
ho object to seeing your son put everything 
into the hot chocolate and eat it then.ﬂ So, 
we were given a separate room, and for six 

months, I did this, and then I started eating again.  I had some sort of disorder, 

whatever it was, I don™t know, but
 for about six months, we 
went almost every single 
day to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and 
that™s how I ate, and also I continued at 
home  to put everything into 
hot chocolate. Hot chocolat
e, whatever I had was hot 
chocolate sandwiches. 
 

Q:  So, do you think you needed soft
 food?  Is that why you think you- 
 

A:  No, it was just tasty. 

 

Q:  It was tasty. 

 

A:  It was tasty, and whatever
 else I liked were desserts Œ 
cakes, and cakes naturally are 
fantastic. So, I reme mbe r  always also duri
ng the day, et cetera, sneaking in some ti me s 
alone or with an aunt of mi ne or with 
my governess going to a particular café in 

Libau for just cakes. I just loved sweets. 
 

Q:  It™s interesting because even though your mo
ther was very strict. She realized that she 
needed to ask you what you wanted. 
 

A:  Yes, because it was a problem, and my fa
ther also. I don™t know to what extent he 
knew what to do or didn™t know because in 
those days, actually, 
if a father was a 
physician, he  was not permitted to treat his 
son. You had to go to some one else, and 
the pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a 
ma n by the name  of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was 

the father of the head of Œ later on Œ the 
head of intelligence in Israel, _____, and 

whose nephew was the Israeli Amba ssador he
re, Rabinovitz in Wa shington. They all 
come  from Libau, and the father, Dr. Ra
binovitz was my pediatrician. So, I don™t 
reme mber if I was taken to him for this or 
they just spoke over th
e telephone or what. 
This, of course, I don™t know, but- 
 

Q:  But, you think it lasted for about six months? 

 

A:  It lasted Œ yes, that™s what my mothe r  
told me after the war when we discussed it. It 
was, she said, ma ny, ma ny months probably up 
to about six months that we had to do 
this. 
 

Q:  Now, do you reme mber when you stopped us
ing cocoa?  I don™t mean to drink, but to 
use it with your food. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
5 
 
 
A:  Well, I would say by the time the war br
oke out, yes, when we didn™t, yeah. And, 
actually, it was yesterday, I th
ink, yes at the Holocaust Museum that I had some  hot 
chocolate for the first time in years. 
 

Q:  Was it good? 

 

A:  Wonderful, I loved 
it. (laughs) I loved it. 
 

Q:  Tell me  about your brother. What was his name ? 

 

A:  Bernhard Boris Schwab, a
nd for short we called him Bubi. 
 

Q:  Bubi. 

 

A:  Bubi, he was about eight, ni
ne years older than I, and he 
Œ he adored me . He loved me   
 very, very much, but I was sometime s not very nice to him. I would tease him this 
and that, so on and so forth, and some times
 he got angry at me I reme mber, running 
after me  and sort of hitting me  over my r
ear because I really teased hi m a lot.  I 
reme mber once on a tennis court, after I a
nnoyed him, but he was really wonderful, 
and until he was taken away, I mean, he 
took very, very good care of me  when we 
were just the two of us and we were alone, yes. 
 

Q:  And, was he an easy going...? 

 

A:  He was easy going, yes. He
 loved to read. He devour
ed reading, and it™s very 
interesting. The last two years of the Gy
mnasium, he rema i ned sitting. He failed 
because he was interested in his own agenda
 just  to read. He was interested, and he 
just kept on reading and didn™
t care about school, but this ha
ppened with me  too whe n 
I went to school. One day, I reme mber comi ng home  and declaring, ﬁI know 

everything there is to know. I know how to
 count to a hundred.ﬂ I knew the alphabet. 
ﬁAnd, I™m not going to school anymore or if 
I have to go to school, I will simply not 
pay attention because I love to play with 
my game s and toys, et cetera, et cetera.ﬂ  

And, sure enough I failed every cour se save English because English was some thing -

you were a wizard if you learned English 
and very, very few people because my 
parents were brought up with French, but I 
was brought up with English. I had British 
tutors and so did my older brothe
r. So, I passed only one subject. 
 

Q:  English. 

 

A:  English, and that was English. I rema ined
 sitting, and what was Œ what happened was 
war broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, ﬁMy god, war broke out now. I 

will not have to go back to school.ﬂ 
 

Q:  And, that was relieving to you? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
6 
 
A:  That was very Œ that was a relief th
at I would not have to go back to school. 
 
Q:  Were your parents upset 
that you were happy about this? 
 

A:  No, no, actually, I™ve been thinking about
 it, and I don™t remember having discussed 
this with my father, but they did not seem
 to be perturbed or anything of the sort. 
 

Q:  And, no one said to you, ﬁYou don™t know 
everything, George, if you just can count 
to a hundred.ﬂ I mean nobody Œ they just accepted what you said. 
 

A:  They accepted what I said, and they let me  
play, and I played a lot. I was fortunate to 
have a lot of toys, and I just
 Œ trains and trains, toys, a
ll sorts of toys. I was imaging 
that I was a general Œ that was al
ready in 1939, 1940 Œ on the _____ Line and a 
cousin of mi ne was the general of the Si
egfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and 
I was ______. We  played war, and we had tank
s and we had airplanes, and we had all 
sorts of toys.  The cousin, this cousin actually
 is still alive. He™s
 older than I am. He 
lives in Salzburg now. So, we often, whenever
 we meet, we talk about our days when 
we used to play war. 
 

Q:  Now, you were probably brought up in 
a fairly wealthy situ
ation. Am I correct? 
 

A:  Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about Œ thinki ng about it 
in anticipation of today, about fifteen years 
or so ago, there was 
a gathering of Latian 
Jews, and I, not thinking, I ma de the stat
ement that I do not reme mber Œ there were 
no, I said, ﬁCategorically, there were no 
poor people in Libau who were Jews in 
Libau.ﬂ So, they snickered at me  saying, ﬁYou don™t know this. You and your fa mily 
probably didn™t know that ther
e were poor Jews in Libau, 
but there were plenty of 
poor Jews in Libau.ﬂ This came to me as
 a surprise. I should™ve thought it through, 
obviously, but I had never me t Œ let™s put 
it this way Œ one who was not, well, well 
endowed from this perspective. 
 
Q:  And, did you live in a big house? 

 

A:  We had a large apartment, very larg
e, probably Œ well, not
 probably, it was 
considered the foremost apartment buildi
ng in the city, yes. It had ten rooms. 
 

Q:  And, was your father™s office in that building? 

 

A:  In the building, yea
h, in the building, yeah. 
 

Q:  Did that mean that he came  upstairs 
for lunch and you would all eat lunch together? 
 

A:  Well, yes he would Œ what we called 
lunch was dinner, and in the evening was 
supper, and we had dinner very
 late about two, two-thirty 
because my fat her between 
ten and twelve he saw patients in the office,
 or was it nine-thirty. Then, he also ma de 
house calls. Then, he would come  for  lunc
h, go out again on house calls, and then he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
7 
 
had office hours, if me mory Œ me mo ry serves 
me  right, from four to six. But, he had 
so ma ny patients that he some ti me s did not 
come  and have supper before eight, eight-
thirty when I did not se e him because  I was already in bed or whatever. 
 
Q:  And, dinner when you would eat what we 
call lunch, but dinner in the mi ddle of the 
day, were there a lot of convers
ation? Wa s this is a very 
perfunctory sort of eating? 
 

A:  No, it was always interesting conversati
on, and when I was finally permitted to join 
them, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoye
d it very, very much.  But, then, when I 
did sort of things that were unaccep
table at the table, I was sent back. 
 

Q:  And, where would be ﬁbackﬂ to-? 

 

A:  To my room. 

 

Q:  Would you eat there? 

 

A:  I would eat there with my governess. 

 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  But, when I was permitted to sit at the ta
ble Œ see, I try to make sure that I wouldn™t 
really spoil things because I didn™t wa nt to be sent  back. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 
A:  But, from time to ti me, I was sent back. 
 

Q:  And, was this your mother ma king the decision? 

 

A:  Mostly my mother, yes. My father
 thought everything was amusing. He did not 
contradict my mother, but I remembe r  one l
ittle incident when my father came in Œ 
which very often happened. He was not there 
on time at two or tw
o-thirty when we 
would have the lunch. He  came in late, and he just  paced in the dining room, and my 

mother didn™t talk to him and he didn™t ta
lk to my mother which was unusual, and it 

still sticks in my 
mi nd. It happened once. 
 

Q:  And, tell me  about your governesses. 

 

A:  Well, I had a nanny as a Œ when I was a very small child. She was Russian, Fanya, 
and I adored her. She was Œ I just could™ve sold my parents. She was Œ she was 
it
 so 
far as I am concerned, so far as I was con
cerned  And then I was being prepared that 
I™m going to be a big boy, and the summer 
we were going to spend in Riga Beach, 
and when I will come  back, I will ha ve a governess and no longer my na nya, my 

nanny, and I didn™t really understand what th
ey were saying, and we always went 
summers to Riga spend time  at the Riga beaches, to the resorts in Riga.  And, when I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
8 
 
came back, she wasn™t there, and I just di
dn™t understand it. And, 
I reme mber crying, 
but then we had engaged a German govern ess, Fraulein ____ was her name. She was 
very strict, more in my mother™s tradition 
than in my fa ther™s tradition which was 
leisurely. My mother was much more Prussi
an in this sense, and the governess was 
also in that tradition. 
 

Q:  So, this was not comfort a ble for you. 

 

A:  No, but I had no choice. 

 

Q:  Yeah. Did you actually complain to your mother and say, ﬁWhy are you...?ﬂ 

 

A:  No, I don™t reme mber complaining to her. 
I even think I had a crush on her. She was, 
as I reme mb er, very attractive. She proba
bly was, I don™t know, I guess must have 

been in her late 20s or so. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  And, I thought she was very attractiv
e, and I actually tried to behave. 
 

Q:  Oh, really? 

 

A:  I tried. Whether I did or 
not, that™s some thing else, but 
she taught me  so, proper table 
ma nners. She taught me  also had to greet pe
ople. We were also taught how to walk 
properly.  This was part of our- 
 
Q:  Now, was this the ma jor thing the 
governess would do was teach you how to act? 
 
A:  No, also with the home work, et cetera, 
and we would play game
s together. We would 
go out on walks and meet friends of mi ne, et
 cetera. We were there with the other 
governesses, yes. 
 

Q:  So, did you really spend any more tim
e with the governess th
an you did with your 
parents? 
 

A:  Well, when I was in school, let™s say 
I was in school Œ I would come  home. There 
was my governess. In the morning, no she 
was not a live-in governess. I got- 
 

Q:  Oh, she wasn™t? 

 

A:  No, she was not a live-in governess. Sh
e would come  in the morning, but breakfast, 
my mother did not serve me  breakfas t . It
 was our housekeeper, and she was always 
there when I came home  or would pick me
 up from school, and then we would come  
home . We  would go for walks. We  would do th
is. We  would do all sort of things, yes. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493

Q:  And, given the fact that your mother 
wasn™t working, what was she doing during the 
time when you and your brother Œ when 
he was young enough Œ was being taken care 
of by a governess? 
 
A:  My mother used to 
be a professional cellist. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah. She went to the famous Riga C
onservatory which was a very, very fa mous 
school where as Isaac Stern once put it,
 you could go to any of these Russian 
violinists, it doesn™t matter who it is, 
they all came out from Riga, from the 
conservatory. She was playing a lot, but 
not professionally. Every two weeks or so, 
there were chamber mus i c evenings at our 
house. She would drag her cello, go to the 

home s of other people where they™d play, a
nd evenings when they would go out a lot, 
there was an opera, there was a theater in
 Libau. There were people who would come  
to our house for card game s, kind of gin rummy 
that they used to play, and then there 
were big events in the house where the 
me n would play a game  called _____, and the 
wome n would play gin 
rummy which they called in Latvia, Kunken.  
 

Q:  Kunken? 

 

A:  Kunken, K-u-n-k-e-
n, it was a kind of gin rummy. I tried to mi ngle some time s, and 
some ti me s I actually succeeded and she di
d not say anything, but there was a very 
interesting incident that I reme mber. I love
d dogs, but my mother did not permit us to 
keep dogs in the house. So, I would 
bring stray dogs to the house. 
 
Q:  Into the house? 
 

A:  Into the house. 

 

Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  But, we had several entrances, bring it
 in through the rear en
trance where we had a 
very large kitchen and a ma id™s room, in 
between the kitchen and the ma id™s room, 
there was another little corrido
r. And, my mother hardly ev
er went into the kitchen. 
So, she didn™t know what was going on, and I 
kept the dog over there in the rear and 
we also had a balcony. One day, there was 
a big card game  at the house. The me n 
were in one of the living rooms what  we called ______, and my mother and her lady 

friends were playing canasta in the dining 
room, and the housekeeper came  in and she 
was not called. Instead of addressing her as
 Frau Doctor Schwab
 or Mrs. Doctor 
Schwab, ﬁIt™s either the dog 
or me.ﬂ My mother said, ﬁWhat do you mean? What do 
you mean?  What dog? ﬂ ﬁ Would you please mi nd 
comi ng into the kitchen?ﬂ She got 
up, went into the kitchen and the dog went flying out. So, then, of course, I was called 

in. I said, ﬁLook, I meanﬂ I said, ﬁIt™s not 
my fault. The dog simply followed me . I 
didn™t bring it. I had nothing to do with it.ﬂ But,
 I loved this dog so, and this is just an 
instant that does come  back to my mind.

Q:  So, the dog left or did they kick it out? 

 

A:  Yes, it left. No, the dog left, unfortunately, yeah. 

 

Q:  Did you hear your mother play cello? 

 

A:  Yes, oh yes. 

 

Q:  Did you like it? 

 

A:  I never liked the cello. 

 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  No, but she also played the piano. We we
re forced to play the piano as children. I 
preferred to piano. I didn™t 
like the cello. I preferred, of all the instrume nts, I 
preferred the violin, but my favorite
 instrume nt is still the piano. 
 

Q:  Yeah? 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  And, do you still play? 

 

A:  No. 
 
Q:  No? 

 

A:  But, I was Œ before I hated it because I 
was forced to play it for something like fi ve 
years. My older brother, too, and my mother
 would sit there and lis
ten to us play, and 
correct us so on and so forth, but
 we had teachers who taught us. 
 

Q:  Now, I know a bit about why she wasa disciplinarian. Being a musician, they go 
together in some  ways. 
 

A:  You ma y ha ve a point, yes. 

 

Q:  They™re similar in some  ways. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  All right, we™re going to
 have to change the tape.

Q:  George, how much older wa
s your father in relationship- 
 

A:  My father was about twenty years ol
der than my mother, and it was interesting 
because my father was engaged several times before he met my mother, and he came 

back Œ and this was in Ri ga, he came back from a n engageme nt with a cousin of his 

and going back to Libau because my grandfat
her was at that time sick apparently.  
And, on the railroad station, he saw my mo
ther with a number of other young wome n 
seeing off some body on a train that was going to
 Germany. And, my father saidto his 
cousin, ﬁThis is the woman I™m going to ma rry.ﬂ So, his cousin, whom I knew, he 

died about twenty year ago in South Afri
ca, said, ﬁ_____ You™re crazy. You™re nuts. 
You just came from an engagement.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁI don™t care, and I™m going to go to 
the train and I™m going to sit in the same
 _____, in the same compart ment with this 
ma n and find out who this woma n is.ﬂ He 
got onto the train, didn™t go back to Libau, 
got into the same compartment, and said a
pparently to my mother™s brother, ﬁWho is 

this woma n?ﬂ ﬁOh, it™s my sister Clara Jac
obson _____ et cetera et ceteraﬂ The next 
station, my father got off, went back to 
Riga and then to Libau, and started sending 
letters to my  mother, didn™t know her ag
e, and it was signed ﬁDr. Schwab.ﬂ The 
appearance of Schwab is a German na
me . After two weeks, he sent a ____. 
 

Q:  No kidding? 

 

A:  A ____. We ll, Dr. Schwab is probably Jewi
sh, and then my parents said, and all of 
them, the sisters, my mother was the younge
st Œ all the sisters 
and brothers said, 
ﬁ Well, let™s take a look at hi
m. Let™s invite him and take 
a look at him. Let™s look at 
him.ﬂ So, two weeks later, they invited him 
and he came to Riga, and he came  in and 
greeted everyone, and my grandparents™ appare
ntly had lined up the six sisters. There 
were six sisters and three br
others in the fa mily. And, to
 see if my father would 
recognize the one that he wanted. The nerve 
that he had, he came  in, and walked over 
to my mother and gave her a kiss. A
nd, then said, ﬁLook, I have to get some 
me dications here in Riga fo
r my father. Would you like 
to accompany me?ﬂ because 
he had there a ____. It wa s a what you would call here a driver ____. 
 

Q: Yeah, I don™t know. 

 

A: A  ____ in Russian, and they went out for a few hours to get the me dication. They 
came back, and my father announced that they
 had decided to get ma rried. My mother 
didn™t even know anything about it, and that
 he  will be back in two weeks, and 
everything can be ready. My mother said to me  later on, she wa s so embarrassed to 

say no, et cetera, that she said
 to her parents, ﬁYes.ﬂ Bu
t, her parents kept on saying, 
ﬁLook, you don™t have to go through with it if
 you don™t want to.ﬂ But, she ma de one 
condition to my father. He had a mu
stache. That he would have to- 
 

Q:  Take it off? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
12 
 
A:  Take it off because she di dn™t like must
aches. So, what she did Œ they got ma rried, 
and then he said, ﬁWell, now we™ll go 
to Libau.ﬂ So, my mot her was under the 
impression that he would stay in Riga and m
ove in with the rest 
of the family because 
she was not interested in going to Libau. A
nd, later on when she spoke of home  when 
we lived in Libau, home  to her was always 
Rega, which was very interesting. It was 
home. It was a very happy marriage I must 
say. They adored each other. And, I must 
say that I grew up in, despite the sternness 
of my mother, I grew
 up in a very warm 
home. 
 

Q:  So, she was affectionate as well as stern?  

 

A:  Oh yes. She was affectionate, but st
ern. There was no nonsense. There™s a right way, 
and there™s a wrong way, period. 
 

Q:  Now, this story that you just rec
ounted, you heard from your mother I gather. 
 

A:  Not only from my mother, 
but I also from the cousin 
from South Africa. We were 
talking about, and he recounted it. And, also 
from an aunt of mi ne who Œ and some  of 
my mother™s friends in Ne w York. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  Very lucky that they got 
along. It™s a very strange story. 
 
A:  Yes, but they did, and there™s still a 
woma n actually in London who is a very close 
friend of one of the people who works with ______, very close fa mily friend, but 
more my br other™s age than my age, who said it was an idyllic ma rriage. 
 

Q:  It™s an interesting story. So, how ol
d was your mother when they ma rried?  Do you 
know?  
 

A:  She was around 17. 

 

Q:  Really?  So, she 
was really a kid. 

 

A:  Sixteen actually, no 17, and on her 18
th
 birthday, my older brother was born. 
 

Q:  Wow, now was that 
very young at that time ?  
 

A:  Apparently not so young I those days. 

 

Q:  I see. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
13 
 
A:  But my mother was the fi rst of the si
sters to get married. Some never got married. 
Two of the m never got ma rried, but she wa
s the youngest. She sort of paved the way. 
 
Q:  Now, I understand you had a trolley car model? 

 

A:  Well, in Libau, we had trolley cars, 
and I loved going in tr
olley cars. My life™s 
ambition was to become  a conductor. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah, and when we would go on the trains
 to Riga, my life™s ambition was to become  
an engineer who drives a locomotive, 
or whatever you call them. This was my 
horizon. And, when the planes starting fl
ying between Riga and Libau, passenger 
planes, I™ve never been on a passenger plane 
Riga-Libau, I wanted to be come  a pilot. 
So, speed, in other words- 
 

Q:  Is very important. 

 

A:  -is very important , and where did I get it
 because I saw a lot of the American movies 
in Libau where you saw in New York, bridges 
going up, cars, all these things. It ma de 
a tremendous impression on me. I loved Amer
ican movies. I loved Shirley Temple 

and I went around saying she wa
s a cousin of mi ne. (laughs) 
 

Q:  (laughs) Did anybody believe you? 

 

A:  Well, these were kids. (laughs) 
 
Q:  It™s interesting because I think that ma
ny of us, we know the movies went to Europe, 
but it™s so interesting to hear
 people who were living in Eu
rope in ‚30s who actually - 
the impression was very big. 
 

A:  Yes, Bobby Breen, Tarzan movies, Bobby Breen, Shirley Te mple, these were- 

 

Q:  These were big things. 

 

A:  These were big things for me  as a child, yes. 

 

Q:  Right. Did you ever want to be a doctor? 

 

A:  My father said it™s not good to be a doctor. 

 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah. The reason Œ and my mother reinfor
ced it saying that his 
was called out very 
often at night, at three o™cl
ock at night, and he made these phone calls Œ he ma de 
these house calls, sometimes at three o™cloc
k in the morning on an emergency, when I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
14 
 
would wake up and here the telephone ring, 
et cetera. I would wake-up. My mother 
usually accompanied him. There was a driv
er downstairs, and some ti me s I went 
along, and I stayed with my mother in th
e car and my father went in.  But, I 
reme mber one incident with a Latvian patient,
 my father decided to take in the car Œ 
the back seat in the car with my mother 
and him Œ between my mother and him, and I 
was in the front with the driv
er, and the patient wa s very, 
very sick and the patient™s 
wife was also there and blamed the car. 
 
Q:  For making him sick? 

 

A:  For ma king him sick. Well, these were p
easants, obviously, and this
 is some thing that 
still sticksin my mi nd today. 
 

Q:  I understand that you spoke Germ
an more than you spoke Latvian. 
 

A:  Yes. Our Œ my mother tongue is German, yes.+  

 

Q:  Now, can you explain why that would be
 since you were born and lived in Latvia?  
Why your mother tongue w
ould be some thing else? 
 

A:  First of all, we lived in Courla
nd, which was once upon a time Ger man ____ where 
you had the German and also subsequently 
the Russian aristocracy
 congregating over 
there.  We  were products of Ger man culture
 over there. So, we  did not grow up with 
Yiddish. In Libau, by and large, at that
 time  I did not know of anybody speaking 
Yiddish. Let™s put it this way. 
It™s only in the ghetto that
 I learned about that. And, I 
reme mber my father saying, ﬁThat Yiddi
shﬂ and my mother also, ﬁwas not a 
language. It was a jargon.ﬂ 
A jargon. We used the French word in German, jargon.  
And, language is some thing that one has to
 be in command of. So, the first language 
was really German that we spoke. When I 
was small and my parents didn™t want me  
to understand some thing, they spoke Russi
an which, of course, bothered me . So, I 
picked it up because I heard Russian be
ing spoken all over the place. I went to 

Latvian school, and Latvian school of 
course we spoke Latvian. Our ma i n 
housekeeper, we spoke Latvian. When we had another one, Fe nya, she was Russian, 

and then my  father in the building had a nur
se, Maria. With her, I spoke German. So, 
I grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German. Two, I  

would say, was probably Latvian at that 
time. Three, Russian, and English four, 
because I really liked it, a
nd I ma de a point of really getting it under my belt. 
 

Q:  Right. How were you when you were in school with Latvian?  Wa s it uncomfortable 
for you?  
 

A:  Well, I remember one anti-Semitic incident. We all had uniforms, and one day I was 
called on to recite a poem. We  had to get 
up. I got up. I started to read it, and the 
teacher said, ﬁYou can sit down. He reads like
 a Je w.ﬂ I didn™t think I ha d an accent, 
but you didn™t have to. You c
ould be perfect and still be 
called a Jew for some thing. I 
complained. I went home. I complained to my fa ther and my mother, and my father 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
15 
 
imme diately telephoned the director of 
the school. ____ was his name . This was a 
Latvian school. He was a patient of my
 father™s.  He came to the house and 
apologized to my parents that it would neve
r happen. I was called in ____ office. He 
did not apologize to me . He turned the tables and said, ﬁYou have to be a good boy.ﬂ 
I told this to my parents. ﬁDon™t worry. It™s
 not going to happen ag
ainﬂ, et cetera, et 
cetera.  In this class of about 25, there we
re three Jews, but when the teacher ma de 
this rema rk that I read like a Jew, ever
yone started to laugh. It was very embarrassing 

to me , obviously, and this irked me .  But, otherwise, I personally did not sense any, 

what we would call today, anti-Semi tism. 
In those days, I wouldn™t have known the 
term, obviously.  Next to our school was 
a Jewish School, and some ti me s we had 
ma tches Œ soccer ma tches Œ not soccer ma tches actually snowball fights. So, we the 

Latvians would fight the Jews, the La tvians
 school and Jews, but
 did not have any 
overtones. It did not 
have any overtones. 
 

Q:  And, then you considered yourself a Latvian more than you knew you were Jewish. 

 

A:  Yeah, oh yes. I always knew I was Jewi
sh. We  grew up in an assimilated fa mily. I 
knew about Passover. Once or twice I went 
to the synagogue with my parents in the 
High Holidays and I love d Passover because of the _____ matza. The ma tza was what 

they called- 
 

Q:  With horseradish on it? 

 

A:  No, it was cheese and egg on top, and don™t 
ask me  about menus, the finished product 
was absolutely delicious. 
 
Q:  Matza fried? Fried matza with eggs? 
 

A:  It was Œ no, you put egg on top of the ch
eese and then you baked it, et cetera, and 
then you put some  cinnamon and sugar on top, and it was absolutely delicious. 
 

Q:  It sounds good. 

 

A:  Yeah. My mother was no good cook. She l
oved to bake, but had absolutely no talent 
when it came to cooking, and when she Œ I re
me mber, this is an interesting incident, 
she once cut her finger in the kitchen doing 
something, and my father got upset and 
said, ﬁIf I see you again in the kitchen, the enti
re staff will be fired.ﬂ
 Your place is at 
the cello and not in the kitchen.  
 

Q:  And, you heard this? 

 

A:  I heard this, yes. 

 

Q:  You heard this. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
16 
 
A:  He was mad because it was a pretty ba
d cut. I don™t know what she had done, et 
cetera, and later on when we came t o the st
ates and my mother had to cook for me , 
she would go and buy steaks, the best steaks 
that she could get, and a steak Œ I don™t 
know a couple of dollars in those days. Sh
e didn™t know Œ she would ma ke the steaks, 
and she said to me  in the dimi nutive jocula
r, I don™t know what I do, but you can play 
football with it because it was all to her 
cooking. She just did not know how to cook. 
 
Q:  How to do it. 

 

A:  How to do it, but when it came to baking, she loved it, and she loved to bake. But, for 
cooking, et cetera, this Œ sp
eaking, comi ng back to what you asked me  before about 
these poor pe ople. There was one schoolboy in my class, ________, and I became 

very friendly with him, and he invited me
 over to his house. Not far from where we 
lived, and he lived Œ it must have been a very
 large room wi th his parents, a table in 
the mi ddle and a number  of beds. We  played. 
It must have been just underneath a roof 
between Œ I reme mber climbing a number of 
stories, a number of floors and then we 
got into a kind of an attic. I 
think they must have lived in
 an attic, and I thought it was 
the greatest thing because he was young a
nd strong, and I was not. He was street-
smart, and I was not. And, I thought of how
 wonderful it is to
 live like this, how 
wonderful it is to be like this because 
I was the exact opposite, and I just enjoyed 
playing with him, and I was invited. He died
 recently. He™s on one of the photos that I 
have over here. So, this is I do re
me mber that I had this encounter. 
 

Q:  And, did you go there often? 

 

A:  Probably three, four times or so, ma yb
e more, mo re time s et cetera, but not very 
often, no. 
 

Q:  Did it influence you in some  way, the way he was? 

 

A:  Well, it became a kind of a role model for me to be smart, to be strong, smart, this 
and that. This also remi nds me  about sc
hool. School Œ you could, if you gave some  

kids protection money, they would prot
ect you and you could have your commandos, 
and for a centime or two or so, you coul
d ﬁbuy your protectionﬂ and they would 
become  your protectors, and I had my allo
wance, whatever, maybe a quarter a week 
which I would spend ma ybe ten centime s a week to pay off these guys. 
 

Q:  What would you have to be protected from?  

 

A:  I don™t know because there were school fights. 

 

Q:  Fights. 

 

A:  There were fi ghts among the kids. 

 

Q:  So, they would fight for you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
17 
 
 
A:  Then they would help me . Yes, they w
ould come  to my help if need by, but I never 
got into Œ I don™t reme mber having gotten 
into an actual fight, but just almost 
automa tically. 
 

Q:  It™s interesting. 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  Did you play sports? 

 

A:  I used to swim and tennis, 
yes. These were the two things. 
 

Q:  Not soccer? 

 

A:  I wasn™t good at soccer. I wasn™t good 
at any of the other things, but I was good at 
tennis and I was good at swimming, yeah. 
 

Q:  The friends that you had, were they more 
parts of the fa mily, or where there a lot of 
friends from school th
at you played with? 
 

A:  Not from school. These were friends or fr
iends of my parents and the kids with whom 
I associated with, with whom I played. My
 best friend was a chap by the name  of 
Sasha ____. Sashenka we used to call him. He
 was also a role model, and the parents 
were the owners of most  of the movi e houses in Libau. So, we could sneak in back, et 

cetera, and watch then. He was very wild, 
and his language some times was off-color, 
and I would come  home  with the same 
language, and I was asked, ﬁWhere did you 
hear this word? ﬂ  ﬁOh, yeah, Sashenka us
ed it, et cetera.ﬂ So, for a while I was 

forbidden to see him, but the relations were
 soon repaired between the kids to give 
you just an incident. He was 
wild. I was wild, but I always
 managed to play innocent. 
Nothing was ever my fault. See, so. 
 

Q:  So, you™re very clever. 

 

A:  Well, I guess I had to learn. 

 

Q:  When you say Sasha was wild and you were wild, what do you me an by that? 

 

A:  In the mi ddle of the city, they had a big garden where they lived, and he would throw 
stones across a wall to the neighbors aimi ng 
at people. He would instigate me  to do 
the same. 
 

Q:  And, did you? 

 

A:  Yes, I did, too, et cetera and of course
, there were complaints. ﬁAhﬂ, I said, ﬁForget 
about these complaints.ﬂ Sometimes not us
ing proper language. So, I came  home and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
18 
 
I thought, you know, that to be a wizard. Like, 
knowing English is to be wizard, it™s a 
term that we used in Libau was _____, wizard. 
 
Q:  _____ 

 

A:  ____ very _____ actually, and yeah, so.  

 

Q:  So, you liked breaking out of- 

 

A:  Oh, yes. 

 

Q:  -the discipline. 

 

A:  Oh, yes, oh, yes, I certainl
y did. I liked it very much, but 
I wa s always sort of put in 
my place at a certain point. 
 

Q:  But, you clearly kept both in some  ways. You knew how to be very disciplined, but 
you- 
 

A:  Yes, I could Œ I felt comf ortableŒ let™
s put it this way. I felt 
comfortable in home 
circumstances with my mother™s friends so 
on and so forth, but I also felt comfortable 
in the milieu of my Latvian friend and th
e impoverished, and the impoverished part. 
 

Q:  But, Sasha was not. 

 

A:  No, no, no. 
 
Q:  Sasha was- 

 

A:  Sasha was- 

 

Q:  In a privileg
ed situation, too. 
 

A:  Oh, yes, very privileged situation, yes, 
very privileged situation. Where he picked it 
up, I can™t tell you. He had two older brothers, 
more my brother™s age.  Where he got 
it from, I don™t know, and that
™s where I learned, yeah. 
 

Q:  Now, when you hit Œ I don™t know, it™s hard
 to know when you as a child would start 
hearing things. The Nazis take over in 
Germany i n 1933. You™re two years old. I™m 
sure you™re not hearing anything then. 
 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  But, suspicion is by the time 1938 hit. 

 

A:  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I was- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
19 
 
 
Q:  Did you begin to hear- 

 

A:  Oh, a lot. There were a lot of discussi
ons, and I will never forget when the aunt who 
came to Libau, she was going to ma ke me  these Viennese sandwiches so on and so 

forth, I reme mber still my aunt was saying to my father, the Anschluss was taking 

place in Vienna when Hitler marched in, that
 Jewish wome n were forced to take off 
their furs and to wipe and polish the cars.
 My father said, ﬁYou™re dreaming. I don™t 
believe it. Ge rman Culture, Deutsch Couture, 
they wouldn™t do this.ﬂ And, my father, 
to an extent, was a product of Germa n cu
lture, and during Wo rld Wa r I, the German 
occupation, they behaved very, very prope
rly toward the indi
genous population of 
Latvia. So, my father dismissed it.  
 

Q:  Even though she had seen it. 

 

A:  Even though she had seen it, he had dism
issed it outright, and I reme mber this very 
well, this incident. 
 

Q:  So, that must have been very meaningful to you. 

 

A:  Very meaningful, yes. 

 

Q:  Did you wonder?  C
ould she just see- 
 

A:  No, look, I did not have an analytical mind in those days, I mean, in retrospect. Of 
course, I was short-sighted 
on my father™s side, yes. 
 

Q:  It™s interest ing wh
at people will believe- 
 

A:  That™s right. 

 

Q:  And, what they don™t believe- 

 

A:  Exactly. 

 

Q:  When they™re told things. 

 

A:  Exactly, yeah. 

 

Q:  Okay, we need to stop the tape. 

 
End of Tape 2 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
20 
 
Tape 3 
 
Q:  Okay, George, besides hear
ing this about the Anschluss in
 Vienna and realizing that 
your father just doesn™t belie
ve this, do you hear about other things going on about 
treatment of Jews, about
 concentration camps?  
 

A:  Not that early on the concentration ca
mps, no. The only incident that I reme mber 
about treatme nt of Jews was the one 
related to my father by my aunt. 
 

Q:  That™s the only one? 

 

A:  That™s the only one at th
at time , yes. I do reme mb er very distinctly, the outbreak of 
war in September 1939 from the radio. We  had 
radio which we could hear the entire 
world, and we heard the announcement from
 Wa rsaw when German bombers were 
arriving and bombing and ev
eryone was glued to the radio, and of course, the 

discussions why people in the Baltics were
 safe because we were called ______, sort 
of buffer states, and if the Germans were 
to invade, the Russians would come  in. 
They would immediately repel the Germans a
nd vice versa, et cetera. So, that™s why 
the Baltics will re ma in immune to the war, 
and after all, as it was pointed out, and 
here my me mories were very keen becau
se this was some thing new exciteme nt. I 
liked exceptional situations, and incidental
ly my first book is titled, ﬁThe Challenge 
of the Exceptionﬂ because exception I find mu
ch more interesting than the rule, the 
norm. This was very exciting, war. I di
dn™t understand what it meant bombs falling, 
people running, et cetera. This was exciting. 
A nine year, ten year
, nine year old kid, 
eight year old kid, et cetera, what did I 
know?  I didn™t realize, 
I mean, today I would 
say I was a little je
rk thinking about it. 
 

Q:  (laughs) Right. 

 

A:  And, the discussions at the dinner table, 
supper, centered a lot a
bout the war and what 
was happening, and the Ribbentro
p-Molotov Pact of August 23
rd
, 1939 where the two 
have come  together, and after all, Hitler 
and Mein Ka mpfe was also saying that the 
reason Œ one of the reasons Œ why Germany lo
st World Wa r I, and he will never ma ke 
the same  mi stake, is fight on two fronts, a
nd after Poland fell, I me an the war was still 
on with Britain and France, even tho
ugh it was a kind of a phony war during the 

winter years until April, May 1940. So, everyone 
felt safe in the Baltics. We felt safe. 

Nothing is going to happen to us. 
 

Q:  Given you were so excited in some  ways
 that there was a wa r, but death was not 
meaningful for you at this poi
nt, of course, did you in some  way hoping that it would 
come to Latvia? 
 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  You wouldn™t. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
21 
 
A:  No. 
 

Q:  So, it was enough that it was some pl ace else. 

 

A:  It was some place else, ye s. It was exc
itement, but someplace else. No, I di dn™t think 
so. 
 

Q:  So, you™re okay in 1939. It doesn™t 
feel like anything is going to happen. 
 

A:  No, no, life was beautiful. 

 

Q:  Life was fine. 

 

A:  Life was very, very fine, very beautiful
, very exciting. I loved to go to Riga. I could 
never understand why we lived in Libau in su
ch a small city and not in Ri ga with 13 
trolley car lines and Libau only two. More 
interesting cafes that in Libau, better 
gossip, I guess. 
 

Q:  How do you understand your 
father not going and having 
his practice in Riga do you 
think?  
 

A:  Because the fa mily is from Libau. My gr
andparents lived in Libau. We  a ll were from 
Libau. 
 

Q:  I see. So, he preferred to
 stay within that context. 
 
A:  Yes, yes. 
 

Q:  Now, in June of 1940, the Russians occupy. Am I correct? 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  Do you remember the beginning of the occupation? 

 

A:  Actually, I reme mber it very well. I was 
on the Riga beach with one of my aunts and 
cousins and uncle, and my mother immediately came to Riga to the beach to fetch 

me, and I was in my aunt™s apartment. Th
is was already a day or two before it 
happened, in my aunt™s apartment which was 
not very far from the Soviet embassy in 
Riga, and from her terrace, I could h
ear over the loud speaker Vishinsky, the 
notorious Vishinsky addressing the crowd,  
welcoming Latvia to the Soviet Union 
because the Soviets came in at the invita
tion of the Latvians, according to him, and 
from the balcony, from the terrace, I could 
also see how the Latvians were ma rching 
with big banners, and I assume d that on 
those banners were ﬁWelcome Russia. We ™re 
finally liberated from the dictatorship 
of _____ﬂ Whatever. I only saw the placards, 
but not what was on the placards. So, these ma
rches Œ yes, I, I was in Riga on that day 
and I heard his voice, Vishinsky™s voice.

Q:  And, your impression of this?  Thiswas very impressive and interesting? 

 

A:  Everyone seemed worried. 

 

Q:  They were- 

 

A:  Everyone seemed worried, yes, but- 

 

Q:  Not you? 

 

A:  Not me , no, no. I felt safe . I, some  way or
 another, felt safe. I 
didn™t Œ I never thought 
that I had to worry about a
nything, let™s put it this way. 
 

Q:  And, when you say everyone was worried
 Œ your father, your mother, your aunt. 
 

A:  Well, this was- 

 

Q:  The adults? 

 

A:  Yes, the adults in Ri ga, but my mother took me  a day or two later, took me back to 
Libau, yes. So, in Libau, we went to the beach
 as usual, to the tenni
s courts still in the 
first few weeks, et cetera. Finally, we were
 permitted to talk to Russian soldiers 
because the Russians had established bases in
 La tvia already in September, October 
1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
, but we were not permitted to talk to 
Russians. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah, but now we were permitted to talk 
to Russians, and I reme mber on the beaches, 
the Russians, also Russian soldiers, Russian
 trucks on all the beaches, and we could 

get these Russian insignias what we cal
led _________, et cetera. So, we begged them, 
et cetera. But, soon after th
e occupation, we were all no
tified in our building where 
we lived that we had to evacuate, and ev
acuate it rather rapi dly because it became 
eventually the headquarters of the Co mm
unist party for the Libau and the region 
around Libau, but we received an extension for a couple of months. First of all, they 

needed my father™s expertise, and we ha
d to fi nd a smaller apartment which turned 
out in my mother™s mi nd to be a disaster 
because we had to live in six rooms. How 
are we going to ma nage six rooms?  My God... 
 

Q:  And, how many did you have before? 

 

A:  About ten. How are we going to do this?  
I had to double up with my brother. We  had 
the same bedroom. My father was not permitted to put up Œ to have an offi ce, but he 

was permitted to see pr ivate patient s because, again, of his specialty. So, he had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
23 
 
kind of a sitting room wher
e his library was, but all the X-ray machinery, ______ 
machinery, all this was stor
ed in the maid™s room. 
 

Q:  And, could he use it? 

 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  He couldn™t use it? 

 

A:  No, because he became head of the polic
linic over there at a salary and everyone 
laughed at it in the family of some th
ing like 30 Rubles a month. We  were not 
dependent obviously on the 30 Rubles a mont
h. And, he started getting patients for 
which I don™t think, I me an, he charged. I 
reme mber the admi ral of the fleet _____or 
some thing along those lines, came and consulte
d my father and he even came  to our 

house for dinner, the admi ral, and I reme mb
er this because I admi red his uniforms 
and the illustrious me dals that he wore.  That was in the new apartment that we had. 

In the old apartment, we had to take in 
a Russian soldier. Everyone had to take in 
Russian soldiers because Libau was a majo
r base for the Russians, and Libau had 
three ports that never froze 
in the winters and that™s 
why you had also a very big 
naval port in Libau where part of the Ru
ssian fleet was stationed. So, it was very 
strategic significance. Libau as a city, 
and that is probably 
why Libau was much 
bombarded by the Nazis in ™41 when they i
nvaded, and in ™44 and ™45 Œ and there was 
a lot of fighting in and around the city, a
nd the city was about at least 85 percent 
destroyed in contrast to Ri
ga which was not a strategic 
site, and there was relativel y 
little fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved. 
 
Q:  And, when this Russian soldier came into 
the original apartment, he lived in a room 
or what?  
 
A:  He lived in a room, yes. He came, bu
t some time s drunk, had very curious habits, not 
washing hims elf, but s praying himself with
 a kind of an autocologne that smelled 

terribly, but this was co
mmon apparently among the Russian soldiers. Different 
culture- different habits, et cetera, and pe
ople used to laugh. I reme mber my parents Œ 
the Russians loved music, and  they would go to the opera, an in those days when you 

went to the opera very often you put on a 
tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth. 
So, the Russians wanted to show how well th
ey can dress. So, some  of the wome n Œ 
the wives of the officers came in long nightgowns. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah, and I reme mber snickers about this
. I certainly do reme mber this, but then they 
distinguished you had still officers from the ol
d Czarist days, and this I reme mber my 
parents saying what a difference it make
s from these _____, I mean the ordinary, 
fro m the old days. The aristocrats versus
 ____. You can see, of course, immediately 
the difference. Or, if they try to be like the 
aristocrats, you just ha
ve to scratch a little 
bit and you saw where they came fr om. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
24 
 
 
Q:  Now, do you reme mber this soldier?  Wa
s he Œ did he have any relationship with you 
or not?  
 

A:  He was very friendly, very friendly. 
He would come . He would sleep. He would 
leave, but this was hi
s room. He had the keys
 to the apartment. 
 

Q:  So, he didn™t 
eat at your house? 
 

A:  This I don™t recollect. I 
don™t recollect him eating in th
e house. Maybe in the kitchen 
or so. I don™t recollectthis in the dining room. I don™trecollect this, but we  also had 

to Œ we could no longer have sleep-ins. 
 

Q:  What does that - Do you m
ean with other people comi ng in? 
 

A:  Well sleep-ins, I mean, because nobody was permitted to be a housekeeper. 

 

Q:  Ah, I see what you mean, right. So, you don™t have a housekeeper. 

 

A:  No more staff, no, but a woma n Fenya,
 this woma n who didn™t sleep-in but always 
come  in to work. She kept on comi ng to clean up the apartment. 
 

Q:  And, that was okay? 

 

A:  That was still okay, yes. 

 
Q:  So, who started cooking, your mother? 
 

A:  Good question. I reme mber one incident
 Œ no, I think it was Stepha, no, Fenya who 
did some  of the cooking, but I reme mber one
 incident in the morning when we lived 
in the new apartment, and I had to go to school, my mother would prepare the 

breakfast for me  and said, ﬁLet™s do it 
very, very quickly, and we™ll eat in the 

kitchen.ﬂ And, I said to her, ﬁI™m not a ma id.ﬂ 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah, I said to her, and I reme mber that
 very distinctly, and my mother remi nded me  
of this after the war. It  seem
ed funny to eat in the kitchen, 
and this brings back a very 
funny story. My father had a cousin in
 Libau, _____ Rabinovitz, whose two sons 
lived here in the United States. One son 
used to accompany _____ a mus i cian. He had 

Carnegie Hall in 1925 so on and so fort
h until ____ died, I think in 1929 if my 
me mory serves me  right. And, then he became a big _____ here in Hollywood 

playing behind mostly the piano. And, in 
1936 or 1937, he came  to Libau and begged 
his mother to come  and live with him in Hollywood, leave La tvia, and he said, 

ﬁMother, I™m going to build you a house w
ith a Hollywood kitchen where you can eat 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
25 
 
in the kitchen.ﬂ She said, ﬁEat
 in the kitchen? For this I 
should move to America? ﬂ To 
give you just an anecdote, but the me ntality. 
 
Q:  Right. 

 

A:  Yeah. ﬁEat in the kitchen?  Fo
r this I should move to America?ﬂ 
 

Q:  Funny. 

 

A:  Yeah, and that remi nded me of my little incident . 

 

Q:  Yes, and you were a kid? 

 

A:  I was a kid, yeah. 

 

Q:  Right. So is there a significant chan
ge when you had to move  to the smaller 
apartment, or do things pretty much s t ay okay? 
 

A:  Well, it was much, much smaller the ap
artment. My father was working. He saw 
private patients, but could not use his X-rays 
or his laboratory, et cetera. That was all 
gone. Did we starve?  Food became more s
carce. Let™s say a person could not buy 
more than, let™s say a pound of sugar per 
month. I™m thinking of an arbitrary- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -figure, but I do reme mb er if we wanted 
to have meat, it also became  scarce, and our 
new apartment was not far from the ma
rketplace, and every person could buy so 

much and so much meat. So, I went online 
to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I 
don™t reme mber, and I paid. So, we had Œ 
and, my mother went online. So, that 
between the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sump tuous meal. To give 

you just one idea. 
 

Q:  So, there wasn™t a restri
ction in terms of a fa mily. It
 was a restriction per person. 
 

A:  It was. I remember this very distinctly, 
yes, per person. So, therefore, my mother went 
probably an hour later or so, and I went at
 nine. I don™t know what time it was, at ten 
or she went at twelve , whatever. 
 

Q:  But, none of these restrictions were because you were Jewish? 

 

A:  No, no. 

 

Q:  This is- 

 

A:  Everyone. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
26 
 
Q:  Everybody™s in the same  situation. 
 

A:  Yes, everybody™s in the same  situati
on, yes. Everybody was in the same  situation. 
 

Q:  Now, are you beginning Œ forget the Je
wishness part for a mo me nt Œ but, are  you 
beginning to feel the harshness 
of what war means, and what occupation me ans, or is 
this you think because they™re communists and so- 
 

A:  They™re communists and we were vitriolicl
y anti-communist, and in my class, almost 
everyone joined the Communist Pioneers. 
I di d not because we belonged to the 
ﬁBourgeois Classﬂ and we were Œ the class 
was being lambasted all the time. And, we 
were scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before 

the outbreak of the war. 
 

Q:  In 1941? 

 

A:  ™41, exactly one week before the outbr
eak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly Russian 
trucks appeared all over the city telling 
you you have to pack your things and leave. 
We™ll take you to Russia. We  didn™t know 
whether we would be taken, too, but a lot 
of the well-to-do people, a 
lot of the Jews, also Latv
ians, but proportionally more 
Jews than La tvians, were taken and shipped o
ff to Siberia and to that part of the world 

in cattle cars, and this was just one week, 
exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of 
the war between Russia and Germa ny. 
 

Q:  Now, when you say that you were Œ a
nd I™m assumi ng you mean the family Œ was 
vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you 
believed about the Comm
unists or is that 
because the Communists saw 
you as Bourgeois and would not accept you?  Or, was it 
both?  
 

A:  I think it was both. I thin
k it was both. Again, I can™t be a hundred percent certain, but 
I just know we were anti-Communist, and 
it was my decision not to join the youth 
move me nt. Again, my parents didn™t say anythi
ng that I had to or so. My father felt 
probably si gnificantly secure again because 
of his specialty as a gastroenterologi st, 
not to be too worried, but still, and also 
the fact that he had prominent Russians now 
from the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients. 
 

Q:  And, let me  ask you something Œ is part of
 the reason also that 
you didn™t want to join 
not just ideological but the f
act that they were also very disciplined and you were 
going to be indoctrinated on certain things
, or you just didn™t agree with them?  
 

A:  I just didn™t agree with them, and I didn™t 
Œ at that  time, I tried to intuit myself into 
that situation. At that ti
me , I si mply thought that Co
mmunism was wrong. Why?  I 
don™t know. 
 

Q:  I see. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
27 
 
A:  See?  Of course, we were chased out of 
our apartment, but in contrast to the other 
ones, we were permitted to stay there another month or two, but I do remember my 
mother complaining, ﬁHow are we ever 
going to live in a six room apartment? ﬂ 
 

Q:  Right. That included 
a kitchen, right? (laughs) 
 

A:  It was the library, living room, dini
ng room, two bedrooms, I had to double up with 
my brother, and in order to ge
t into the Œ not into the, we 
had different Œ the toilet was 
in a different part of the apartment from th
e bathroom, and my parents to take a bath, 
they had to go through our bedroom, my brother™s and my be droom. So, t here was not 

this privacy. So, wait a second, in Europe 
we don™t call the kitchen a room, or the 
ma id™s room. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  No, so, actually to us, 
the library, living room, dining 
room, two bedrooms Œ five, and 
there was a kitchen Œ six, and the maid™s
 room, actually seven, seven rooms, but it 
was Œ and the rooms were much smaller th
an we had originally. A little footnote 
about this. I was persuaded by Œ I don™t 
know if the name  me ans anything Œ Per 
Ahl mark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Mi
nister of Sweden, played a very big 

role in Jewish life since the ‚70s, ‚80s Œ 
very pro-Israel, very 
pro-Jewish, convinced 
Elie to go back to ____ and accompa nied Elie to ____ and wrote about it for the 

Swedish press. It was he who persuaded me
 to go back and accompanied me  too, and 
wrote a series of articles in the Swedish pr
ess about my return to Libau. Be fore we 
went into any of my apartments where I li
ved in Riga and Libau in 1990. We  had the 
President™s car and one his Œ 
another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so 
we could get into any apartment. I sai
d, ﬁPer, before we go into any of these 
apartments, from the outside I will tell 
you exactly the layout so you will not think 
that I™m i ma ging or inventing certain thi
ngs.ﬂ Later on he told
 me, ﬁGeorge, I™ve 
never seen anybody who has such a me moryﬂ,
 because I was precise on every single 
issue. For example, befor e  I went into the 
apartment, I said to him, ﬁWe had central 
heating.ﬂ You see?  And, I told him e xactly 
where it is, and I show
ed it to him which 
was still preserved. In Ri ga too where I usedto stay with my aunt in a very luxurious, 

large apartments. At that tim
e in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person. She had an 
atrium apartment. There were about three or
 four fa milies living, and I showed him in 
the room where I used to sleep, et  cetera, dini ng room, living room, sitting room, 

library, et cetera. He said, ﬁYou know this me mory™s absolutelyﬂ because, I found Œ 

everything I found to be fascinating, the bi
g world. Now, I heard these talks about 
when my pa rents talked when they were in 
Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets, 

this and that. That™s what I wanted to do, 
and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was 
ma rried to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935. Whose father was 

already ambassador in the days of Bismar
ck, the Germany, a nd when she would talk 
Œ and so I always thought of foreign polic
y. I didn™t know what it was, but the 

lifestyle, I just loved 
it. I ate it all up, et 
cetera. The diplomatic 
life, what my mother 
would tell me about when they were in 
Berlin in the ‚20s, what was going on so on 
and so forth. For example, my mother love
d to go in the subways. She said, ﬁI came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
28 
 
here in order to see Berlin.ﬂ My father 
had lived in Berlin because he had studied 
there. ﬁI want to see Berlin. I go by bus.ﬂ 
My aunt said, ﬁBut you 
have my car with a 
driver. What™s the ma tter with you, Clara?ﬂ My mother said, ﬁNo, I am goi ng to go in 
the subway. I am going to go in the elevat
or. I™m going to go in the buses. I wantﬂ 
She looked at her as if she was crazy, and it 
turned out later on, a
nd my aunt told me  
that my mother knew Berlin better than she knew it. 
 

Q:  She did. 

 

A:  Yes, because this aunt ha d survived
 and died in Riga about 20 years ago. 
 

Q:  But, your memory of some  of the details 
of what an apartme nt looks like is Œ I don™t 
know. It doesn™t seem typical to me  that
 you as such a young child would have such 
very vivid memory of these rooms and the layout. 
 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  That™s really some thing. 

 

A:  And, Per, as I said, who is very often speak
s at Jewish events in 
the United States and 
in Israel, as I said, and very close to Ellie
, and he come s with me  all the time , every 
time I go back to Latvia, or almost every time . He has been with me . 
 

Q:  And 1990 was the first time?  

 

A:  1990 was the first time, yes, and I think 
we had sent you some Œ Sheila sent you some  
ma terial on this. 
 

Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  Of my first visit, how Pe r convinced me  to go. 

 

Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  That™s Per. 

 

Q:  Yes. O0kay, we™re going to ha
ve to change the tape again.

Q:  George, just to go back for a mo me nt , you™ve referred to some one name d Elie quite 
often. So, I assume  you™re meaning Elie Wi esel 
 

A:  Correct, Elie Wi esel. 

 

Q:  Because othe rwise some  people ma y not
 know who it is. Di d you go to school when 
the Russians were occupying? 
 

A:  Yes, and it was for one year, but I still we
nt  to sc hool, and that™s when I really failed 
all the subjects. 
 

Q:  Oh, that™s when you failed? 

 

A:  Yeah, and war was kind of a relief for me  
when it broke out. The first thing that came  
to my mi nd is, ﬁI will no l
onger have to go to school.ﬂ 
 

Q:  To school. 

 

A:  Yeah. Wa it a second. Yeah, that was the year. 

 

Q:  That was the year. 

 

A:  That was the year. 

 
Q:  Did your father have to 
acquire some military status during this period of time when 
the Russians came? 
 
A:  Not in uniform, but when the war broke
 out, we could not run to Russia because it 
would have been considered desertion. It was 
considered that he had to be on the spot 
for his duties. 
 

Q:  So, does this mean that when people were
 told they could leave Latvia a couple of 
weeks or a week before- 
 

A:  No, the week before the outbreak of 
the war, these were the so-called ﬁmass 
deportationsﬂ 
 

Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  You could™ve left then? 

 

A:  With the ma ss deportations?  No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
30 
 
 
Q:  No? 

 

A:  No. These were forced deportations. Th
e trucks arrived. ﬁFamily X Œ we™re looking 
for A, B, C, D Œ Fa mily X you have to be packed what you can carry with you in two 

hours, and we™re taking you to Russia to 
work, work camp. You™re a Bourgeoisie. 

That is you belong to the Bourgeois cla
ss.ﬂ And, that was that. And, proportionally 
ma ny more Jews were sent out 
than Latvians because he Jews  were in certain of the 
professions, and also in 
ma ny of the businesses. 
 

Q:  I see, and that was your fath
er™s status as being a doctor? 

 

A:  That was our interpretation at the time.  

 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  That was our interpretation. 

 

Q:  And, what is the ma jor religion in Latvia. 

 

A:  Lutheran. 

 

Q:  Lutheran? 

 

A:  Yes. 

 
Q:  Huh. Now, i s  your brother taken in to be
 part of the army?  I mean, he™s now what 18 
years, 19 years old? 
 
A:  He just graduated gymnasium, and befo
re the war the talk was after he would 
graduate gymnasium, of course, you couldn™
t send him to Germany to study at the 
university. So, they were going to send him to England. Wh y to England especially 

Ca mbridge? Che mistry. He had some inclinat
ion in that direction. So, they figured 
that he would end up in England studying Chem
istry. My mother later on told me that 
before Hitler came to power, it was assume d that we would Œ the kids Œ would study 

at one of the German uni versities. 
 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  But, certainly, England, the talk of England came in only later on when Hitler was 
already in power that they would not be
 able to send him to study in Germany. 
 

Q:  Now, during the Russian occupation, t
hough, your father isn™t ear
ning a lot of money, 
really. The money that he has possessed, that
 the fa mily had, was not confiscated as 
far as you know. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
31 
 
A:  Well, my mother told me that we had withdrawn a large sum 
of money be fore the 
Russian occupation occurred from the 
bank, a considerable amount, but not 
everything should be suspicious, so only a pa
rt. And, we were able to exchange some  
of it into Rubles, but there were price cont
rols in the Russian 
period. So, if you ma de 
30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe w
ith three Rubles or four Rubles, but 
money was not an issue and wasn™t Œ a
nd I reme mber the snickers about the 30 
Rubles that he was ma ki ng, or 35 Rubles perh
aps, but it was very low. It was in the 
30s I reme mber, but it didn™t ma tter to us personally. 
 
Q:  Right. So, are you Œ is there any apprehen
sion that there™s going to be a war comi ng 
to Latvia, that the Germans will do so me thing that this won™t stay- 
 

A:  No, no because according to the Ribbentr
op Molotov Pact, La tvia and Estonia and a 
good part of Lithuania fell under the Russian 
sphere of influence and subsequently 
occupation, and that Germans would not dare
 attack Russia. This behemoth for as 

long as the war still is go
ing on in the We st. So, ther
e were no fears of war. 
 

Q:  So, this deportation, this ma ss forced 
deportation, you think it 
had nothing to do with 
the Russians thinking there™s going to
 be a war. They just did it. 
 

A:  That™s a ve ry good question, and that™s
 still be ing speculated about. Stalin and 
Molotov were convinced, and I™m not talki
ng now as a child. I™m talking about with 
my knowledge as an academic, where convi
nced that there would be no war with 
Russia Œ with Germany at this time. The lower downs believed that there will be 

because the Germans were sending spy planes 
al l the time . In fact, the week before Œ 
two weeks before the outbreak or three w
eeks before the outbreak, we could see 
planes very, very high up. 
 
Q:  And, could you see them?  

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  You could? 

 

A:  You could see them, yes which we assume d wer e  not Russian planes. 

 

Q:  But, nevertheless, you we ren™t Œ the 
people you were around were not suspicious. 
You wouldn™t be. 
 

A:  No, no. 

 

Q:  You were too young. 

 

A:   We  were not suspicious. That was elsewh
ere, the war, not Œ it would not come  to the 
Baltics. We  did not like the Russians, but 
in comparison, of course, the Russians were 
the lesser evils. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
32 
 
 
Q:  They still we re the lesser evils even to you. 

 

A:  Yes. We ll, the point is, late
r on in comparison to the Nazis. 
 

Q:  Ah, okay. 

 

A:  Yeah, but we were, the fa mily was together. We  really did not starve. We  were not 
sent out. Friends of ours were deported, yes,
 but my aunts and unc
les in Riga were 
not deported. So, by and large, by and large,
 we were satisfied. Of course, the press 
was a controlled press. My parents now spoke 
much more often in Russian in front of 
me  for fear that I should not go to school and say some thing anti-Communist, and 

then be arrested because a child ha d said
 something. I sensed it of course, and I 
resented the fact that my parents did not 
trust me , and that was probably one of the 

reasons I did not join the Russian Yout
h Moveme nt, the Young Pioneers because 

everything was now hush-hush at
 home  for fear that I ma y s queal because I was a 
child. 
 

Q:  Right. So, you think you didn™
t join partly because you felt? 
 

A:  Yes, because  I was vitriolicly anti-Comm
unist like my parents, and I sensed it at 
home , what I overheard, what I understood fr
om t heir Russian, et 
cetera, I kept my 
mouth shut, but nevertheless, they had 
to be cautious. I understand. I understand it 
now. I didn™t understand 
it at the time obviously. 
 

Q:  Now, what language were you speaking in
 primarily now since before the Russians 
come you™re speaking primarily German. 
 

A:  I continued to speak German with my parents, yes. 

 

Q:  You did?  With you parents? 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  And in the street, with the kids? 

 

A:  It was Latvian. 

 

Q:  Was it Latvian? 

 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  And, could you speak a little Russian 
with the Russian soldiers that you- 
 

A:  Yes, oh, yes. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
33 
 
Q:  Yeah? 
 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  And, this is not a harsh occupation excep
t for the forced?  Or was it a harsh, ma ybe it 
was? 
 

A:  I don™t think it was a harsh occupation be
fore the deportations. Freedom of the press, 
of course, was curtailed. Harsh from t h
e viewpoint  of physical harm, no, until the 
deportation, yeah. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  I™ve read that people were arrested for 
anti-Communist, anti-Bolshevik statements, so 
on and so forth. Yes, we heard about this
, but the imme diate circle, our imme diate 
circle, as I understood it at 
the time, was not affected.  
 

Q:  Some thing radically diffe
rent happens in 1941, however. 
 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  Do you remember the move into Latvia by the Ge rmans? 

 

A:  Very well, I reme mber the outbreak of 
the war very well. Actually, what happened, 
the war, the Germans invaded on a Sunday 
morning, early morning. Saturday night, 
my parents went to sleep only 
at three or four because they played cards at our house. 
There were about six or 
seven ladies played Gin 
Rummy, I mean Kunken, and 
suddenly early in the mo rning, 
there was lots of noise, bombs
 being dropped et cetera 
on that Sunday morning, June 22
nd
, of ™41, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a 
balcony not a terrace, actually only a balc
ony. And, we all went out to see what 
happened, and we saw German planes, ______ , 
flying very low where we could even 
say hello to the pilots and they sort of wi
nked back at us because it was very low, 
bombing certain parts. We didn™t know wh
at was happening. We  turned on the radio, 
no news. The news about the outbreak of the war did not come  for hours because the 
Russians were taken by surprise. They di
dn™t know. Subsequently, I read in the 

history books that Stalin t
hought that it was not Hitler behind this, the ____ went 
behind Hitler™s back because Stalin and 
Molotov were convinced that the Germans 
were not going to invade, and now suddenly, 
they did invade. So, the bombings Œ this 
was very exciting. Again, our building was not hit. It was some place in the center of 

the city. I did not imme diatel
y see any ruins, but as the Germans were mo ving closer, 
they occupied Libau one week after the outbr
eak of the war. My father took us to the 
hospital which was a little bit outside of
 the city in a safer neighborhood, and we 
stayed there for a couple of days until
 the Germans came in. But, during the 
bombardme nt, we also stayed one night in 
a basement in the center of the city in a 

kind of a policlinic, a small 
hospital, and there I saw a lo
t of the destruction already, 
and that became  to dangerous to stay there 
in the center of the city because this was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
34 
 
being bombarded by the German Navy and s
ubsequently by the Army. So, we move d 
to the larger  hospital outsi de the city Œ well, 
it still was in the city
 district, but in the 
residential area right near 
the beach, and I distinctly 
re me mb e r  w h e n  t h e  G e r ma n s  
arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my fath
er to accompany them to ﬁwelcome  the 
Germansﬂ with roses, et ceter
a, and my father went and 
asked about the Jews and the 
Lieutenant in the car, and I reme mbe r  him 
comi ng back saying the Jews have nothing 
to worry about. We  now have a common foe,
 and we must fight this common foe and 
the Jews are part of this war. In the 
naivety, fighting if you 
fight together we™re 
civilized Germans, not racists, et ceter
a. Like in World Wa r I, if you fight 
Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of
 assured, and in a certain naivety, he 
believed and ma de us rather believe that 
we have nothing to worry about, or ma ybe 
he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case. 
 
Q:  So, how did you feel that he asked the Germans this question? 

 

A:  He came ba ck. 

 

Q:  And he told you what he asked them? 

 

A:  Yeah, he told us and my brother, my 
mother and me  et cetera, yes, and we all 
listened, et cetera. There was a kind of a co
mmand car that appeared and he was part 
of the welcoming commi ttee that he  was asked 
to participat e, and in this context he 
asked about the Jewish question, a
nd he was assured by this officer. 
 

Q:  That everything would be okay. 

 
A:  That, Yeah. 
 

Q:  Is this as if your father either kne
w nothing or paid no attention to what was 
happening to Jews in Germany?  Did you have any idea? 
 

A:  Originally, I™m convinced. Again, this is 
my interpretation that he did not genuinely 
believe my a unt when she said- 
 

Q:  What had happened. 

 

A:  -what had happened with the Germans with
 the Jewish wome n polishing the cars with 
furs. Later on, my interpretation again, is that
 he did not want to worry the fa mily. So, 
he always looked at the gl
ass half fu ll rather  than
 half empty. That™s my 
interpretation. 
 

Q:  Is it possible that he never asked the Ge
rmans this?  He simply told you this so you™d 
feel okay. 
 

A:  I would Œ it could very well be the case
. It could very well be
 the case, and then 
afterwards the same  day, we took our baggage
 and we walked back to the apartment, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
35 
 
and the house was still standing and we saw 
the German occ upiers on the street and 
they left us alone. We  left them alone. I re
me mb er staring at them, and then we went 
back to the apartment. 
 
Q:  The same apartment, the smaller apartment? 

 

A:  Yes, but in the meanti me we had also
 heard that a number of Jews were shot by 
Latvians because the Latvians were also vi
triolicly anti-Communi
st, and in some  of 
the German propaganda that leaked 
through, I guess, the Germans equated 
Bolshevism with Judaism so on and so fort
h. So, apparently, some  people were shot 
even before, just before the Germ
an occupation took place in Libau.  
 

Q:  So, how long is it when things become
 rougher and it™s no longer the same  life for 
you? 
 

A:  Al most immediately. 

 

Q:  Al most immediately? 

 

A:  Al most immediately. I reme mber my fath
er having to go to a gathering place every 
morning to be assigned for work. My father
 wore his red cross arm band. My brother 
going to work. A cousin of mi ne was  shot 
dead by the Germans apparently, he had 
just ma rried a Latvian girl before. She was 
pregnant, but I was lead
 to understand that 
she also had a lover, and I 
was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew 
and he was shot and my father was called on 
to go to the ceme tery to identify the 
body, and he came back to the house and I wa
s there, pale saying, ﬁYes it was ____ 
who was shot dead.ﬂ He identified the body, 
and that was about a week to ten days 
after the occupation, and it was not long ther
eafter when my father was arrested, 
tortured and killed, yes. So, we i mmediat
ely began to feel it, almost immediately, 
within days I would say, yes. 
 

Q:  And, when you saw that your father comi ng 
back, it must have been very shocking to 
you to see him looking- 
 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  He must have looked awful. 

 

A:  Yes, yes, yes, yes. Then, I no longer t
hought in terms of me  a nd the I, et cetera. I 
began thinking in terms of the larger pictur
e that is our fate, no longer my school. I 
mean, this became irrelevant. It was not even a footnote in my life. Now, the issue 

became life and death. 
 

Q:  And, you™re ten years old. 

 

A:  Yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
36 
 
 
Q:  About ten. 

 

A:  Yeah. Nine and a half at the time  now. 

 

Q:  So, the quick relief of ﬁI
 don™t have to go to school.ﬂ 
 

A:  Oh, that- 

 

Q:  Was all finished. 

 

A:  That was finished. 
That was finished, yes. 
 

Q:  So, do you have trouble sleeping now when you™re- 

 

A:  Now?  

 

Q:  No, I don™t mean now. I™m so
rry, now meaning at the point. 
 

A:  At the point, I don™t rememb
er having trouble sleeping. I slep
t. I lead an active life in 
so far as I kept up with the news, the late
st news, what™s happening all the gossip, the 
dangers, by the time  the evening came around, 
I assume  I was  exhausted. I was still a 
kid. So, I seemed to sleep very well. My mother was assigned to go to work, and 

someti mes she was able to take me with her. This was she was kind of a seamstress, 

ironing. I reme mber her doing working in, I gue
ss it must have been a laundry. If I 
think of it today, for the Germ
an Air Force in Liba u. She was, and then at a certain 
point, she became the housekeeper, ma id for th
e mi stress, for the Latvian mi stress for 
the head of the _____ in Libau, and my moth
er knew her from before the war because 
they used to meet at the same hairdresse
rs called Mary™s. I still reme mber. This 

mi stress apparently had a liking, took a liki
ng to my mother, and sent a long to the 
ghetto, but this was already in the ghetto pe
riod. But, before the ghetto period already, 
extra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews, she would 

tell my mother, ﬁYou better bring George 
with you to the apartment.ﬂ So, I would 
stay for the day at the apartment safe when
 my mother was cleaning or whatever, yes. 
But, things became in a sense chaotic, but th
ere was within this chaos, there was still 
order. 
 

Q:  How Œ I don™t know whether at the time  you would know, but perhaps only 
afterwards when you talked with your moth
er, how did she take to doing this?  She 

was never doing this sort of work in th
e house. So, all of a sudden, she™s acting as 
some one™s ma id and she™s ironing and she™s- 
 

A:  She said to me  circumstances dictate 
what you have to do. She took it very stoically. 
She took it very Œ but, she Œ I™ve never seen my mother in tears before. I™ve never 

seen my mot her in a state of hysteria. Wh
en my father was arrested, she ran all over 
the place to her Latvian colle
agues who did not raise a finger for my late father. Some 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
37 
 
of the Latvian doctors, I 
guess you know jealousy, profe
ssional jealousy whatever, 
but nothing unusual. They didn™t raise a finge
r even though it was an issue of life and 
death. She went to the _____ pleading for my 
father. She left no stone unturned, and 
at a certain point was told by the ma n who 
really killed my father that he™ll be 
released but a wound has to heal, that guy 
apparently knocked out one of his eyes, 
and was told that they really needed 
him because of his specialty, but the wound 
never healed. So, they didn™t 
want to release him in that
 condition. So, they decided 
to shoot him instead. 
 
Q:  And, that you heard later? 

 

A:  That I heard later, but a patient, a Latvia
n patient of my father™s came with the news 
that his eye was knocked out. He heard it 
from I guess a Latvian guard in the prison 
or whatever, and I™ve also heard it from 
his fellow prison inma tes, Jews who were 

later on liberated or I saw later, what ha
ppened to my father because they were 
eyewitnesses. 
 

Q:  Do you remember the day your father was arrested or weren™t you home?  

 

A:  He didn™t come  home. It was toward the end of July 1941, yeah. 

 

Q:  So, he was working in the hospital? 

 

A:  He was not working in the hospital at that time, no. 

 

Q:  Or, he was doing forced labor, I guess. 
 
A:  Yes, but as a doctor, as a doctor he wa s 
doing this. This was the end of July, and then 
he was shot. 
 

Q:  So, how did you understand this as a young child? 

 

A:  Horrified, absolutely horrified, a
nd you didn™t Œ I didn™t understand. I didn™t 
understand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish. I hardly knew what it 

meant befor e  the war. As I said, I knew 
I was a Jew. I knew about Matza, Passover, 
about certain High Holidays, or when my 
mother and father fasted, or turning on 
candles comme morating the dea
d, et cetera, but otherwise 
I really did not know much 
about the significance. 
 

Q:  So, there™s no logic here
 for you. I mean, nothing ma kes- 
 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  And, even if the- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
38 
 
A:  What the logic was I™m suffering becau
se I™m a Jew, but I didn™t understand why I 
had to suffer because I™m a Jew. 
 
Q:  Right. Then, how do you understand death and murder? 

 

A:  I didn™t analyze it. I did 
not, but I reme mber later on th
inking Œ initially, I did not 
want to die, but later on af
ter Stalingrad, et cetera, I 
did not mi nd. I thought myself 
because I know that the Germ
ans are going to be defeated. 
 

Q:  So, you didn™t mi nd the thought that you mi ght die? 

 

A:  Yeah, I did no longer mi nd it. 

 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  To see Germany destroyed, that was it. 

 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  Yeah. Because I rememb er in the severe 
winter, well Œ I remember in ma ybe it™s later 
it™s been cut now. 
 

Q:  No, you have another mi nute. 

 

A:  I reme mber it was a very severe wi
nter, 1941-42, where I got 
frostbite in Libau, 
frostbite on my toes and my fingers, thi
nking perhaps if the Germans woul d win the 
war, there would no longer be a reason 
to punish Jews for whatever reason, and 
things would get better. So, for a mo me nt, I even thought, however perverse it ma y 

sound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be 

relieved of this mi sery, of this uncertainty. 
 

Q:  So, confusion re
igns in some  ways. 

 

A:  Confusion reigns, but death was there. 

 

Q:  Yeah. Okay, think we have to stop now. 

 
End of Tape 4 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
39 
 
Tape 5 
 
Q:  Okay, George, I understand that you know
 some thing about the circumstances under 
which your father was arrested at
 the ma rketplace. Am I correct? 
 

A:  Yes, he went to work to the gatherin
g place in Libau where the Jews were gathered 
and then the Germans would transport th
em to their outfits, and he saw the ____ 
trucks approaching, and he began to ma ke 
signs to the people on the square, in other 
words, to disperse, and this was noticed
 by the SS people, and they beat him up 
terribly and threw him onto one
 of the trucks, and he among others were taken to the 
prison. That™s where he continued to be tort
ured. That™s where apparently his eye was 
knocked out, and apparently he was going ar
ound looking for his eye, et cetera, and 
couldn™t find it, and begged Œ this is from 
eye witnesses that we have Œ begged to be 
shot, but they kept him alive.  
 

Q:  Tell me  how you reme mber your mo ther was during this period. 

 

A:  She Œ I™ve never seen her be
fore crying or being hysterical. 
 

Q:  But she was? 

 

A:  She was absolutely hysterical when it 
happened. She would say our ____ our dad, our 
daddy, how are we going on from here?  We  
mu st do everything possible to rescue 
him, and she started running around and we 
still had some  hidden diamonds and gold 
coins so on and so forth, and she bribed so
me of the Latvian colleagues especially one 
who used to be a neighbor of ours, Dr. 
_____, a neighbor of ours when we lived in 
the Œ before the Russians came in, in the same. There were two apartments to the 

same  floor and he lived in one of them. 
And, he s a id, ﬁThere™s nothing I can do.ﬂ She 
went to some other Latvian colleagues. They
 said, ﬁWell, there™s really nothing we 
can do or help or say.ﬂ She then went to the ____, but I don™t think she did give 

anything to the ____ people in terms of gold co
ins or diamonds, et cetera. It would™ve 
been much too dangerous, and there was th
is one person who apparently knocked out 
my father™s eye, Handtke who was trie
d after World War II in Ha mburg where 
apparently I have the transcripts where 
this whole issue was brought up. He defended 
himself. I don™t remembe r  the details from th
e transcripts, and he finally said to my 
mother after several days, ﬁYes, we™r
e going to release your husband once the 
woundﬂ some sort of wound ﬁhe has will be healed, but the wound never healed so 

they decided to shoot him instead.ﬂ  
 

Q:  And, how long did it take before
 she found out that he was dead? 
 

A:  The first news as I remember, came from 
a former Latvian patient  of my father™s who 
came to visit us with the news that he ha d heard, and then also some  of the people 

who were arrested together with him, some
 of them were released who saw it, and 
others were also s
hot relatively speaking at the same  ti me .  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
40 
 
Q:  And, did your mother then become  very 
practical about trying to figure out how to 
help the three of 
you survive together? 
 
A:  She relied heavily on my older brother w
ho had leadership qualities which she did not 
really, nor of course I, as a child. So,she relied very much on my brother, and 

together with whatever help 
I could give, we ma nipulated th
e situation to the best of 
our knowledge. 
 

Q:  Your brother is about twen
ty years old in 1941. Am I correct? 
 

A:  He was about nineteen. 

 

Q:  Nineteen? 

 

A:  Nineteen, yes. 

 

Q:  And, your mother, must have been- 

 

A:  In ™41, she was born in 1903. Thirty, 23, 33, 43 Œ 38. 

 

Q:  Thirty-eight? 

 

A:  Thirty-eight . 

 

Q:  So, very young woma n. 

 
A:  Yeah, and she was obviously spoiled from
 her old home, and my father spoiled her 
very much. So, she was not very street sm
art or anything of the sort, but it is 
some ti me s the circumstances that forge an individual, yes. 
 
Q:  So, does she now go to work? 

 

A:  Yes, was forced to go- 

 

Q:  Was forced, right. 

 

A:  To go to work, and then after working 
for a while with the Air Force in Libau,  - 
Libau, that™s where the _____ was, the wa
r port, where I occasionally went along. 
Then, she was taken by the for mer mistress Œ 
by the mi stress, the then mi stress of the 
head of the Gestapo, this Latvian wo ma n, her name  was Mrs. Krohnberg and I was 

led to understand that after the war, she ma
naged to get to Canada and she died in 

Canada about ten, fifteen years ago or so. 
 

Q:  Kronberg 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
41 
 
A:  Krohnberg, in Latvian I guess it would, 
the husband would be the Krohnbergs in 
Latvian it would be Krohnberga, for the woma n. 
 
Q:  Now, is this before the ghetto? 

 

A:  This was before the ghetto, yes. 

 

Q:  In Libau. 

 

A:  In Libau. Yes. 

 

Q:  So, your mo ther has a couple of jobs, 
and are you still living in that smaller 
apartment? 
 

A:  No, in the meantime, several times we 
had to mo ve. We moved in to one apartment 
near my school for a short time . Let me  get the sequence straight. Oh, my  Œ we 

moved into the servant quarte
rs of the Kessel Villa, K-e-
s-s-e-l, because my brother 
married the daughter, but this 
was already a war ma rriage, 
had no legal validity to the 
best of my knowledge. So, the 
front part was occupied, the 
ma in part of the villa was 
occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. 
Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived 
there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Ke
ssel™s Œ the husband was already killed, 

Mrs. Kessel and her two daught
ers, and my brother and I 
and my mother, we lived 
behind the building what used to be known 
as the servant™s quarters. We lived there 
for a while until we had to move fr om there and moved to another quarter  which was 

near my school where we were in three rooms Œ one, two, three. We  were  one Œ my 

brother and his newly acquired 
wife, myself Œ we  lived, slept in one room. My mother 
slept in another room, another woma n Œ Mrs.
 Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs. 
Boop™s apartment. Yes, she was killed dur
ing the war, and two young wome n slept in 
another room. So we were about six or seve
n people in this small apartment of about 
four or five rooms, excluding the kitc
hen. And, from there, well an announcement 
came that we will be moved to a ghetto Œ we™ll ha ve to move to a ghetto which is in a 

part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did 
not know very well, a
nd there in the ghetto 
this was in the summer of ™43, we were as
signed to a flat in a baseme nt that had a 
kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few step
s Œ we had to go about five or six steps, 
right off the entrance, rear entrance of th
e building, and there including the kitchen 
there were one, two, three rooms. So, tw
o rooms and where people could sleep. In 
these two rooms, my brother and his wife
, and my mother and I slept, in this 
basement apartment, and in the other room
 there were about four people who slept, 
and we shared the same  toilet. We  shared 
the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we 
ma de the best of this situation. I was work
ing for a while in the ghetto in the garden, 
vegetable garden, and then I was ﬁasked, invitedﬂ to become  the commandant™s 

runner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant 
wa s not a bad person actually, Kerscher. 
He closed his eyes to ma ny things especia
lly when people brought in some  extra food 
to the ghetto. He did not ma ke a big deal out 
of it, but of course, we also ma naged to 
give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with me ans before the 

war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
42 
 
him, and this remi nds me even before
 we moved into the ghetto, there were 
collections of gold coins. This in order to try to release Jews fro m the prison to bribe 

the Germans, et cetera. So, this was Œ I reme mber people comi ng around for specific 

arrest s that were made and collecting, because
 we were told if we gathered this and 
this and this and this, we would be able to
 get that person out of prison and so on and 
so forth. But, this brings me  back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto. 

Immediately after the revolu
tion in 1917, Lenin needed 
hard currency, and opened up 
the palaces. You could buy everythi ng and 
anything for very little money. And, we 
had antique Œ an antique for example  living 
room that came  fr om one of the Czarist 
palaces. We had a chandelier 
a cobalt with gold chandelier
 that came from one of the 
palaces that my grandparents 
bought and some  of it gave to 
my father as a gift after 
World War I, immediately, and some that 
my father bought including some  art works 
from fa mous Russian artists that he bought 
when he was serving in Russia, and right 
after the revolution that he bought and brought it
 back to Latvia. So, in addition to the 
Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cete
ra, this was very excl
usive furniture that 
we had from Czarist palaces including a 
number of chandeliers. I reme mb er two in 
particular, and all this wa s taken by the Germ
ans before we came  even to the ghetto.  
And, not only the German _____, but also 
the German Navy. There was a certain 

Inspector Ulma nn of the German Navy. Incide
ntally, the old Œ where we lived before 
World Wa r II, the building th
at became  the headquarters of the Communist Party 
during World Wa r II became  the headquarters of the German Navy for the region, 

and this Inspector Ulma nn came very often to
 our apartment, and with a crew would 

take a lot of the things fro m the apartment,
 and then of course, we also had people 
from the ____ comi ng with their crews to 
take, and there was one guy from the ____ 
by the name  of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was 
a collector of stamps, 
and my late brother 
had a huge stamp collection and he traded 
stamps with all over the world. There was 
actually an exhibition here in Philadelphia 
in me moriam for my brother, a big stamp 
collection, where it is all described and I ha
ve a photograph with my late mother, still. 
She was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. This must have be in 1963, when 

there was this big exhibition in
 Philadelphia. And, he took, and I™m sure he took it for 
himself because he was an art collector, a
nd then we had to two Leica came ras, one 
German and one Russian Leica, I remember, 
and we gave one of them to one of the 
Latvians who came to the house to look fo
r things. I think, and I would have to 
establish this, I™m not sure, but one of th
e Latvians was a notorious murderer by the 
name  of Cukurs. He had several fing
ers mi ssing. I don™t know how come , but I 
reme mber fi ngers were mi ssing, and for some
 reason I associate him with the name  
Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the fa m
ous Arias, commander of Latvians who 
killed Jews with a vengeance. And, this 
ma n with the fingers came and looked for 
things, and I reme mber very distinctly 
my mother giving him one of the Leicas 
because we had two still hidden in the apartm
ent. This is when we were still living in 
the apar tment to which we m
oved during the Russian period. 
 

Q:  The smaller. 

 

A:  Yes, the smaller apartment. So, these are 
some  of the things that suddenly come  back 
about the furniture so on and so forth. No
w, how did we get up to this question?

Q:  You went back from the ghetto, but I woul
d like to stay in this period for a mo me nt, 
and ask you what was probably a peculiar que
stion. Wa s there anyt
hing like a funeral 
for your father? 
 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  Nothing? 

 

A:  No, we never saw him a gain. 

 

Q:  Because you never- 

 

A:  Nothing, never saw him, no, no. 

 

Q:  So, did your mother go into mourning in some  way? 

 

A:  You couldn™t mourn in the sense in t
hose days you would wear black for a whole 
year, et cetera. This you couldn™t do. There 
was no way of doing it. You had to go in 
the morning to work whatever, and then th
ey would come  back and in the evening 
hoping to find me  still there, alive, et cetera. So- 
 

Q:  So, there™s really no time for any- 

 

A:  Shiva or so on, no. 

 
Q:  There™s no way to do that. 
 

A:  No, I don™t reme mber Œ we didn™t even know
 exactly the date, but this was irrelevant, 
but I don™t reme mber a Shiva. 
 

Q:  And, do you reme mber yourself responding 
in way like your mother because you lost 
your father, or did you not understand what
 it really meant to lose your father? 
 

A:  I understood.  I mi ssed him very muc h, but
 I didn™t understand what it meant that he 
was shot, but then I had some sort of an i
nkling because when he came home from the 
cemetery where he identified my cousin th
at the person was suddenly dead, and my 
father was arrested. Wha t  I couldn™t understa
nd is that I™ll never 
see him again. This I 
do reme mbe r , that I ma y never see him again. This I do reme mber very, very 

distinctly, yeah. 
 

Q:  How did you Œ was there a 
notice to go into the ghetto? 

 

A:  Yes the bekantmachung 

 

Q:  And, what is that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
44 
 
 
A:  The bekantmachung means a kind of an announcement. 

 

Q:  So, it was a public announcement? 

 

A:  It was a public announceme nt. 

 

Q:  Like a poster? 

 

A:  Yes, yes, by that and that date we had 
to move in, and then we were assigned the 
living quarters. 
 

Q:  So, do you even as a child begin to feel
 that your life is getting more and more 
constricted, or you have no- 
 

A:  Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a ce
rtain point comi ng to this, even going back 
before the ghetto when we had to wear the 
yellow star and had to
 deliver our radios 
and other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the 

sidewalks as Jews. We  could only go right o
ff the sidewalk, and I reme mb er it was in 
the winter, going and a fellow student, a gi
rl, came in my direction. We were in the 
same  class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a 

girl I fancied as a child. Veltina was her name. She sort of looked away, and I felt 

embarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had 
to wear this and I could not go on the 

sidewalk. It was some thing 
strange. Why should I feel embarrassed?  But, I reme mber 
feeling embarrassed that I am who I am. It™s
 a very strange sensation that I had, just 
as strange as the same  winter when I 
thought ma ybe a German victory would be 
helpful to us. Let the Germans win. Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult, 

obviously not. 
 

Q:  Did you ever say anything to your mother 
or your brother that you were embarrassed, 
felt ashamed? 
 

A:  Not in this context, in a different context.
 The children in the ghetto didn™t like to play 
with me  because I didn™t speak Yiddish. I 
spoke German, and they used to call me 
kind of a yeke. I did not speak it, and I 
reme mber going to my  mother crying saying, 
ﬁThe children don™t want to play with 
me  because I don™t speak Yiddishﬂ, and I 
reme mber my mother saying to me, ﬁGeorge,
 there™s really nothing I can do about it. 
I don™t speak Yiddish either. We  have to ma ke
 the best of the situ
ation.ﬂ And, it is in 
this context that I began to acquire Yi ddi
sh because this became  the lingual _____ the 
accepted language in camp, et cetera. 
 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  So, just like I acquired Russia
n, I acquired a smattering of Yiddish. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
45 
 
Q:  The Jews that you are meeting in the 
ghetto, were they not of your economi c class 
because the Russians had sent 
out most of the Bourgeois?  
 
A:  They didn™t send out mo st of the Bour
geois. They sent out
 a good number, but I 
assume , but in those days I didn™t think in term
s of classes, et cetera. I didn™t think in 
terms Œ I didn™t think in these terms, but 
in retrospect, I would say that they came 
fr om a milieu fr om which I did not co me, period. I mean, that™s how I would put it 

now.  
 

Q:  And, did that ma ke you feel uncomfortable  because they were so dissimilar in terms 
of background? 
 

A:  No, I felt Œ I felt bad that they woul
d not accept me and at the same ti me, I was 
envious because they we re stronger than I wa
s. They were better athletes than I was. 
In ma ny wa ys, they were far superior to
 me . So, I was envious actually, and they 
spoke Yiddish which I did not. So, I was e
nvious too. But, as a child, you can acquire 
language very easily. So- 
 

Q:  So, how quickly did you acquire Yiddish? 

 

A:  I guess I still probably ha
ve a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words. So, I could get 
by. In other words, with my limited vo
cabulary, I could get by, and but also 
interesting because the Yiddish we speak in 
the Baltic countries is different from the 
Polish Yiddish. For example, I™m now the 
Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem 

Foundation even though my Yiddish is almo
st non-existent as is Belle Kaufma n™s 
Yiddish almost non-existent, the granddaught
er of Sholom Aleichem, who is still 
alive at 93 and is our Chairman. Wh en wehave the annual meetings of the Sholom 

Aleichem meetings in Ne w York commemora
ting his death because it™s according to 
his will, when some of the Yiddish actors
 read his writings in the Polish Yiddish 

especially in the _____. Yiddis
h, I don™t understand 95 percent. If some body reads it 
with a Baltic accent, not an accent, bu
t pronunciation, I understand fifty pe rcent 
because the Yiddish is more akin to the Ge
rman. To give you just one example, when 
you say Œ in German you say ____, in the Balt ic Yi ddish it would be ___, and in the 

____ Yiddish it would be ____. 
 

Q:  So, it™s quite different? 

 

A:  Quite different. So, I just I 
have di ffi culties with this, yeah. 
 

Q:  Did you mother learn Yiddish in the ghetto also? 

 

A:  I don™t think so. I don™t think so. This wa
s not a problem for her. It was a problem 
for- 
 

Q:  For you. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
46 
 
A:  For me, yes. 
 

Q:  I think we need to change the tape.

Q:  George, let me  just go way back for a s
econd just so we get a context for your fa mily. 
I assume  that your father did not become  
very wealthy because he was a doctor in 
Lativa, that there was mo ney in the family before. 
 

A:  Yes, there wa s money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I reme mber 
my mother telling me  that he would come  ho
me  and take out from his pockets lots of 

money saying, ﬁYou have brought me  a lot of
 luck, Clairehen, Claire. Look how well 
I™m doing in my practice.ﬂ So, independently 
of his parents, but 
my grandfather was a 
big me rchant in the grains Œ import and 
export Œ and, we had at least one warehouse 
that I was aware of with elev
ators in front of it, railroad
 tracks, right at the pier, 
because he exported a lot to England and else
where, but one of my relatives told me  
that we had another warehouse on the other side
 of the pier exactly facing it. This I 
don™t know. Maybe they sold it very early
 on, but I only knew of the other one 
because it was not sold until the late ‚30s, 
the other one. So, maybe the first one they 

didn™t bother talking about. But, I did not
 know until I heard about it over here that 

there was a second one. Also, to give you 
a little background, what I found out over 

here is that when the gover
nor of St. Petersburg came 
to Libau, he would always 
come  to Libau and play bridge with my gr
andfather, and they were very good friends, 
but I would think that the big money came fr
om my grandfather. But, my  father did 
very well in his practice,
 in his practice, yes. 
 

Q:  And, was your mother™s fa mily a well-to-do family also? 

 

A:  Not as well-off as my father™s family, but
 in the six sisters, th
ree brothers, they all 
went to universities, the three brothers. 
The six sisters all went to gymnasium, and 
there you had to pay in those days and musi
c conservatory. My grandfather owned an 
upscale delicatessen store, and my mother
 tells me he brought home  the most 
delicious things everyday fr
om the delicatessen somethi
ng like ____ in Paris, and my 
grandmother, the big money apparently 
came from my grandmother who came from 
the Russian city of ____ and her ma iden name  was ______. She came fr om a very, 

very well-to- do fa mily, and each daughter
, and there was a large family, each 

daughter received a house or a villa as a dowry.  
 

Q:  Wow.  

 

A:  Yeah, so, and she had six sisters and three 
brothers and all were educated this and that 
so, you had to have some  means in order to do this. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  And, in my father™s family, the mother
 of my cousin over 
here studied at the 
University of Geneva in those days befo
re World War I, and Grenoble in France. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493

Q:  Interesting. It seemed important to get 
a bit of that background which we didn™t get 
before. Now, let™s go back to this not so
 great situation in 
the ghetto. How did you 
become  a runner for the commandant?  Do you know? 
 
A:  My German was good. 

 

Q:  Clearly. 

 

A:  Yes, it was my native tongue, ma ybe  I don™
t know. It™s an inte
rpretation. Maybe this 
was one reason why I was ﬁinvitedﬂ to beco
me  his runner. A second reason perhaps, 

it™s my interpretation again is because 
I came from a certain background. I don™t 

know if this played a role, but in additi
on to being a runner for him - when I would 
have to, when I would get a pass that not
hing should happen to me  while I brng a 
watch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let™s say to _____ or to SS ______ who 

was the head of the SS in Libau or to Inspector ____ of the _____. So, and I could 

communicate with the staff over there whatever
 it is in German.  Perhaps this is a 
reason, but again, as I said before, it™s pur
e speculation and I do not know the facts. 
 

Q:  So, the job that you had to be a runner
 was primarily going from inside the ghetto 
outside delivering. 
 

A:  And, also keeping count of the inma tes.
 When we moved into the ghetto, we had 
some thing like 823 people survived out of
 community of close to 8,000. And, when Œ 
in the morning when they left , they were gi
ven a tag, a me tal tag so I had to give them 
the me tal tags as they we nt out to work in
 columns, and in the 
late afternoon, I had to 
collect these tags and hang them up. So, I 
reme mber the numbers, and you could see 
imme diately if some body escaped or what. 
The number, you associated that with a 
name , and that is how you kept tabs. 
 
Q:  And, did you have to write down the person to whom you gave the number? 

 

A:  No, everyone had his 
number or her number. 
 

Q:  I see. So, that was their number. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  What was this like?  You were a 
kid doing this work for this Ge rman. 

 

A:  You didn™t think along those lines. You t
hought about how to survive in this milieu. 
At times, we had basketball game s arranged. There was a school for children which I 

attended on occasion. It didn™t last very l
ong because we were not very long in the 
ghetto.  But, by and large, there wasn™t mu
ch time for self-refl
ection. At least, I do 
not recollect. I do r
ecollect being concerned on ho
w to survive, and under the 
circumstances, we were still lucky because
 I had my mother and I had my brother. 
We lost our father, but there 
were others who had lost more
 than just a brother and a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
49 
 
father, et cetera. So, in the circumstances, 
I Œ I still felt ﬁgood that I had my brother 
and my motherﬂ. 
 
Q:  And, they, I™m assumi ng, were also working. 

 

A:  Working, yes, my mother was working for the ____. 

 

Q:  Oh, that was where she was working for the ____? 

 

A:  Yes, and my  Œ well, she was alre
ady working for the _____ way back in ™41. 
 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  But, for a short time  between let™s sa
y August and September and October when she 
was working for the Air Force because when the big action came , she was already 

working and December was a very bi g action, she was already working for the 

mi stress because she had the letter from th
e ____ that we can not be touched. ____ is 
what we called... 
 

Q:  That December of ™41.  

 

A:  Yeah, ™41, that was December yeah, we
re thousands were rounded up and killed in 
____ 
 

Q:  So, after that there was about a thous
and Jews left, I think, or ma ybe 900 J e ws. 
 
A:  Well, when we moved into the ghetto in
 ™43 there were about 820, yes. I reme mber 
because I was in charge of the big board 
with the tags. So, I knew how ma ny Jews 
came into the ghetto and how ma ny- 
 

Q:  How ma ny?  

 

A:  Yeah, and who stayed in the ghetto becau
se those who stayed in the ghetto I did not 
give a tag in the morning. So, you could 
see the people for illness or whatever. 
 

Q:  Right. How long are you there in the ghetto? 

 

A:  From the summer of ™43 until Œ wait a second Œ no, ™42, summer of ™42 to October 
™43 because Yom Kippur  was very late that 
year, and we were shipped to Ri ga the 

night of Yom Kippur and there was a song 
comp osed by one of the inma tes ﬁYom 
Kippur Bai Nicht, Als Men Sogt Den Ma
lchet, Gebracht Uns Aher In Kazetﬂ 
 

Q:  Could you translate that? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
50 
 
A:  Yom Kippur  Bai Nicht Œ in the eve of Yo
m Kippe r, when one says the Malchet, the 
prayer, Gebracht Uns Aher Œ we were br
ought to Kaiserwald. It™s a very loose 
translation from Yiddish. 
 
Q:  When you picture being in the ghetto in
 that period of time, do you reme mber 
whether people who Œ how were people with each other? 
 

A:  I must say that with very few exceptions, 
they we re very civil, very polite, but this 
was our general upbringing in Libau. Later 
on, I met types I never met before, but in 
Libau, I had not me t types, such types be
fore. So, among ours e lves, we were very 
polite. We  were very we ll behaved to the best
 of our ability, and th
is goes also for the 
ﬁless fortunateﬂ people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the 

war, there was a common level of behavior
 that embraced the, I would say, what I 

knew of the Jewish community, but as I 
proven wrong about sayi
ng that there were 
no poor Jews in Latvia, ma ybe I just didn™t wa
s not in touch with other elements. But, 
after the war and during the war when I sp
ent with ma ny of them
 from many other 
levels, I would say that there was very ci
vilized and Œ under the 
worse circumstances- 
civilized and cultured approach
 to things, to huma n beings, to fellow huma n beings, 
et cetera. You rarely heard of a Libau 
Jew stealing some thing from another Libau 
Jew, rarely. There were exceptions, and th
ey were caught ant they were punished. 
This even went on later when we we re in
 the concentration camp. Among ourselves 
we were very civil, and it didn™t ma tte
r whether Œ from which class you came. At 
least, I had not encountered 
this, and I™m speaking now - 
strictly speaking from my 
perspective. 
 

Q:  And, the____ in the ghetto in Libau, did you know those people? 
 
A:  Yes, Mr. Israelit and 
Mr. Kaganski who was an atto
rney. I told you the woma n in 
California who should be interviewed, his 
wife. Yes, I knew them. Mr. Israelit, he 
was a banker before Wo rld Wa r II. He s poke broken Germa n, but was a very nice 

ma n. I knew his daughter. She was a classm
ate of my brother™s in the Jewish 
gymnasium.  I knew other me mbers of the fa mily, very dignified fa mily. He was the 

number one person, and the number two 
person was this Mr. Kaganski, highly 

educated, very cultured, spoke a very, 
very good German, very handsome ma n. We 
had no problems with our leadership, and I 
hadn™t heard major complaints about them 

from any of the ghetto inma tes. 
 

Q:  Was there Jewish police also? 

 

A:  There was a kind of a Jewish police, but
 of course they didn™t have weapons or 
anything of the sort, and it was, I believe,
 this Jewish police had caught two thieves 
stealing things fr om the st
ore in the ghetto, some  bread or so, and they were 

incarcerated, and I just don™t reme mber know wh
at their fate was. I believe they were 
shot for what they had done. But, this wa
s such a rare exception. It was an exception 
that this should happen among us Libau Je
ws. This was sort of almost unheard of. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
51 
 
Q:  And, what rumors are you hearing 
about what™s going on?  Through 1942, there™s a 
huge numbe r of Jews between ™41 and the 
end of ™42 that are killed that are 
massacred. 
 
A:  Yes, we heard vague stories, but we 
did not know details, but what we did know, 
there were technicians among the former Li
bau Jews who we re technicians already 
then, and they ma naged some  way or othe
r to construct a radio. So, we knew what 
was going on in the world. We  heard about 
the German defeats at the front, which 
was wonderful news to us and gave us 
inspiration, and when we didn™t hear good 
news or anything, we used to talk about the _____ one says rumors. Rumo rs about 

his, et cetera. What are your 
source? ______ agency ____________  says it™s a 
rumor, but it was known as _________________. 
 

Q:  So, were you under the impression, were 
people under the impression between these 
rumors that one says ant the radio reports 
that the Nazis were goi
ng to lose soon?  Wa s 
that- 
 

A:  Not soon, but that they were going to 
lose. This was a foregone conclusion after 
especially Stalingrad, after January ™42,and then of course, we heard about the 

fa mous Battle of Kursk a tank battle which was later wher e the Germans were 

decisively defeated. And, of course in St
alingrad where the Ge rman Field Marshal 
gave up, surrendered with some thing lik
e 90,000 troops. This was vitami ns to us, 
really. I mean we couldn™t have been happi
er. And, then we also heard about some  

British general that was Montgomery chasing 
the Germans all over Africa until they 
were thrown out of Africa. This, of 
course, was very good news, and that the 
Germans we re having Œ were being beaten no
t only in the Stalingr ad fr ont, but in 
ma ny parts of the Soviet Union. 
 

Q:  So, tell me  how you remember who you we
re?  You™re ten, eleven years old, in 1943 
you™re twelve, right?  Because you were born in 1931. 
 

A:  Yeah, but I was born late. 

 

Q:  Late. 

 

A:  Yes, so eleven and a half 
or so, something to that effect. 
 

Q:  So, are you more grown up? 

 

A:  Well. 

 

Q:  Because, you™re st ill a kid. 

 

A:  I™m still a kid. The fact that I di dn™t have to st udy was- (laughs) 

 

Q:  I know. (laughs) You th
ought this was a great- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
52 
 
 
A:  This was a great boom. What did I feel?  The essential thing in ™42-™43 when we were 
in the ghetto. It was a, relatively spea
king, stable period. We  came in 800 some  odd 
people, and we were taken to the concen
tration camp, roughly the same number. So, 
there were fe w killings between the peri
od between the time we got into the ghetto 
and went to Riga Kaiserwald to the c
oncentration camp, but it was still the fear 

everyday. 
 

Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  You don™t know what to expect, and you 
always had to be on the lookout, and 
incidentally, some thing very interesting. Acro
ss the street from one of the streets in 

the ghetto, you had buildings where there we
re lots and lots of Russian POWs , and 
they were begging for bread. They had it much
 worse than we, and we were able to 
throw them some  bread because in the 
ghetto we still did 
not really starve. 
 

Q:  I was going to ask you that. 

 

A:  Yes, we really did not, at least, I don™
t think we starved, no because from with our 
Latvian people, we could deal for this. We  
could get that, and we still had a diamond 
here, a dollar there, so on and so forth. We
 could still do business, so to speak. We  
could still bring in. So, I do 
not really reme mber starving. That we had our pre-World 
War food obviously is not the case or even
 the food that we had during the Russian 
period, but we had enough bread. We had some
 butter. We had someti mes a piece of 

salami . We had even someti mes I got hot c
hocolate. So, I don™t reme mbe r  starving in 
the ghetto, let™s put it this way. 
 

Q:  But, you reme mber these Russian PO Ws starving. 

 

A:  Yes, and how we threw bread over the fence. Yes, I do this. I do reme mb er this very 
distinctly, yes. They were much, mu ch wors
e off than we were at this particul ar 
moment. 
 

Q:  And, do you feel as if you lost your ch
ildhood, that you respond in some  more adult 
way because you had no opportunity to really 
be a child except perhaps pl aying some 
games?  
 

A:  I didn™t think in these terms that I™ve lost my childhood. 
At that age, I don™t think that 
you think along these lines, but what is intere
sting, I think, and I of
ten think about it, 
how I survived because later on I had to w
itness ha ngings so on and so forth because 
I™ve never really seen anybody hang, but this 
goes to late ™44 
early ™45 in Stolp 
_________.  To me , this was a kind of theater. 
I was observing. I was living. If I were 
to put in today™s terms, I was Œ I was an 
actor  in a theater. I was living so mething 
which was not real, and yet it was very real
. I was an actor, and at the same  ti me , I 
felt that I was a spectator, and whatever was going on was interesting to me  for better 

or for worse. It was something of an expe
rience Œ warped in today™s terms, I would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
53 
 
say yes, but again from a  child who is ten, 
eleven, twelve, et cete
ra, it™s a different 
because Œ but, this was really my personali
ty before the war. Everything seemed to 
interest me except school. 
 
Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  I don™t know if I an
swered your question. 
 

Q:  No, it™s an interesting answer because 
there™s some ways in which that may account 
for how good your me mory is because you™re observing so much- 
 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  And so hard. 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  And, it™s a kind of schizophrenia. 

 

A:  Oh, I wouldn™t be myself. 

 

Q:  I don™t mean in mental illness terms. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  But, a kind of distance. 
 
A:  That™s right. 

 

Q:  Do you think your mother and brother was doing the same  thing or wouldn™t you 
know?  
 

A:  I really couldn™t answer becau
se I just don™t know. I don™t know. 
 

Q:  Because, I™m just tryi ng to get, you know
, it™s Œ it™s interesting to try to figure out 
who you really Œ I mean, I can™t see who you 
we re at the age of ten looking at you 
now, you know, as you speak. So, trying to get a sense of what a little boy is doing in 

a circumstance like that is Œ 
 

Man: George, ______ your mi crophone is ______. 

 

Q: I,sorry... 

 

Man: I™m sorry. I couldn™t he
ar what you were saying. 
 

Q: Ok. You couldn™t hear
 what I was saying? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493

Man: It was comi ng out, but it was- 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

Man: __________ 

 

Q: I was saying...now I don™t reme mber  what I was saying. 

 

Man: Sorry. 

 

A:  What a ten year old child- 

 

Q:  With a ten year old child, it™s difficult to
 visualize a ten year old child, and to try to 
figure out who he is in those mo me nts, and it
 mu st be difficult fo
r you to even explain 
it, but I think- 
 

A:  It is difficult, but to me  it was a big spect
acle that in a strange, I would say today, in a 
warped way was interesting to observe, and at
 the same  ti me ,  I was part of the action 
that is part  of the theater, watching ou
t, when will I be next to be shot? 
 

Q:  And, you did think that
, ﬁ When will I be next?ﬂ 
 

A:  Yeah, because everyone thought so, ﬁwhat 
will the next day bring? ﬂ ﬁWhat will the 
next mi nute bring? ﬂ yes. 
 
Q:  So, in those circumstances you slept 
okay, too. You didn™t have nightma res. You 
didn™t have- 
 
A:  No, I did not begin to have nightma res until after the war. 

 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  I don™t remember- 

 

Q:  When it was safer. 

 

A:  What? 

 

Q:  When it was safer. 

 

A: When it was safer, yes. I don™t reme mber
 having nightma res in the Libau ghetto, no 
 

Q:  And, when you were going Œ when the Liba
u ghetto was then liquidated and you were 
then sent to Kaiserwald, everybody we
nt, the 800 some  odd people went, do you 
think?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
55 
 
 
A:  Some  people escaped from the ghetto, a
nd were hidden by La tvians who we call now 
the Righteous Gentiles, and most
 of them survived the war. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yes. Most of the others
 were sent to the Riga con
centrationcamp, Yom Kippur at 
night, 1943, and we were taken to the cargo 
terminal and in cattle cars we were 
shoved in and interestingly, we were told 
we were going to Ri ga. And, Riga just rang 
a bell, some thing clicked. I loved Riga before the war. The ____ the commotion in 

Riga, it was a big city for me  in contrast 
to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller 
city of some  70,000 inhabitant s. Riga at that 
time had close to half a million people. It 
was the city of my dreams as a child. 
So, I imagined Riga when I was being 
transpor ted, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there. I was 

thinking of my aunt™s apartment, the parties.
 I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga 

Zoo, wonderful, wonderful me mories. And, then we were told we were comi ng to 

Kaiserwald. Kaiserwald was the mos t  ex
clusive suburb in Riga at this time. 
Kaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser
. And, one of my a unts and my  granddad 
had a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, 
gorgeous. So, I thought, ﬁKaiserwald, well, 
who knows?ﬂ et cetera. In a sense, I mean, 
obviously here we were in a cattle car, and 
at the same time I was daydreaming about th
e beautiful life that I lived in Riga. 
(laughs) 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  Which is very strange, but I reme mb er th
is very, very distinct
ly, and looking forward 
to going to Riga. 
 

Q:  We have to stop the tape. Is it okay?

Q:  George, can you tell us
 what it was that you brou
ght with you?  Did you have 
luggage?  Did you have special clothes? 
 

A:  We were told that we could take with us
 what we could carry. S
o, I still Œ we still had 
our pre-war clothes. We  were dressed warmly. 
 

Q:  Was it cold? 

 

A:  October, it was beginning to get cold, ye
s. So, we were always prepared. I reme mber 
mother saying it™s be tter warmer because we 
coul d always take off. So, we were very 
warmly dressed. We  each had a suitcase and some other things so on and so forth. So, 

we were transported, and I reme mbe r  we ar
rived in Riga. It wa
s still dark, probably 
very early in the morning next day. Suddenly, the doors were slid open. SS me n 

beginning to scream and also some  of the 
non-Jewi sh prisoners in very strange garb, 

name ly in concentration camp garb scream
ing, ﬁOut, out with you dirty Jews, out!ﬂ 
And, beating us, beating us like crazy, and th
en we had to run from Œ which wasn™t 
very far, ma ybe fifty or sixty yards Œ to 
the camp  from the railroad track. And, there 
we were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile, 

and my mother didn™t want to do it, and 
I reme mber saying to my mother, ﬁBut, 

mother we™re told that we ™re going to get 
it back. So, let™s pu
t it there.ﬂ What do you 
expect of an eleven year old kid?  That™s
 what we were told, and I believed. So, 
reluctantly, my mother and my brother also
 took off the coat, a
nd inside of course, 
were diamonds and some gold coins whatev
er. And, needless to say, we never saw 
the coats again. Then we were chased into a barrack, and next day, we were 
ﬁdelousedﬂ but we didn™t have any lice in 
Libau, and we went through a shower, and 
comi ng out of the shower, we no longer ha
d our old clothes. 
We were given new 
clothes that didn™t fit me . I 
got a coat that came  down to here. I received some  
wooden shoes. What do they call them?  
 
Q:  Clogs. 

 

A:  Clogs. 

 

Q:  Wooden clogs, yeah. 

 

A:  Clogs, some  sort of a shirt, et ceter
a  - not as yet concentration camp garb. And, 
everything was quick, quick, and you had thes
e especially some  Polish and also very 
notorious Ge rman crimi nal _____, some  of the Polish criminals, _____, beating us 

together with the Germans beating us to run 
here and there, and then we were directed 
to a certain barrack where we
™re going to sleep now. I™d never seen before bunk beds 

with straw ma ttresses and straw pillow, a
nd at night I reme mber, the straw would 
come  out and it was very Œ there were no sh
eets or anything of 
the sort, a kind of a 
blanket even in the winter. It was very cold
 which as an ordeal 
especially for me  who 
Œ for everyone who had not experienced anythi
ng of the sort because until then, let™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493

put it this way, in comp arison to the Liba
u ghetto, Riga was Œ Riga Kaiserwald was 
hell, and the Libau ghetto was, in comparis
on, paradise. The beatings, the screamings, 
Appel, for the first time I heard the word 
Appel, the count, in the morning, and to 
ma ke sure that I look older, 
et cetera, at the count, I al
ways scratched together the 
sand and stood on my toes to be taller than us
ual. So, and I was a l
ittle bit taller than 
the rest of the kids in my age group. That
 was probably one of the reasons why I was 
not imme diately selected for being shot. My
 brother after a few days was taken to a 
kaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp wher
e he worked in their reichsbarn which 
had happened to be a very good kaiserni
erung. The people were treated relatively 

well. My mother was assigned to a job in
 the concentration camp, in the tanklager, 
and some times she ma naged to convince, I 
don™t know how that I go with her to the 
tanklager, not to rema in in camp because if you rema in in camp you never know what 

can happen. There were safer days. There we
re less safer days. It was a very, very 
severe winter, the winter of
 ™43 again in ™44, and we we
re working on this tanklager 
again, in constructing railroad trucks
, and there were 
a lot of the- 
 

Q:  Railroad tracks? 

 

A:  Yes, railroad tracks, sorry, tracks because
 it was Œ you had a lot of gasoline storage et 
cetera, and trains came  in where you loaded 
the gasoline, et cetera,
 for the Air Force, 
for the Navy et cetera, and so it was a storag
e, a dump, and also pa
rt of the tanklager 
was also a repair shop for German cars or 
whatever, but I was working a lot outside 
building and repairing of th
e tracks, railroad tracks. 
 

Q:  Is this when you were still in Kais
erwald or when you joined your brother? 
 
A:  No, that™s still in Kaiserwald. I did not 
join my brother until probably it was, must 
have been November or so. 
 
Q:  The following- 

 

A:  Well. 

 

Q:  Oh no- 

 

A:  A month or two months later, 
or ma ybe even three months later. 
 

Q:  Let me  ask you some thing. When you ge
t into the camp, are you separated from your 
brother and your mother? 
 

A:  I was together with my brother for the 
first three days until he was taken to this 
kaisernierung and I was alone. My mother 
was on the woma n™ s side, and there was a 
fence between the woma n™s camp, but I coul d see my mother almost anytime Œ in the 

morning before work or when she woul
d come  back because you could see the 
wome n™s camp. It was just Œ the di stance was 
like from here to the came ra. So, it™s 
just a few feet. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
58 
 
 
Q:  Did you talk to each ot her? 

 

A:  Oh, across the fence. 

 

Q:  And that was okay? 

 

A:  That was okay. In the mornings, I reme
mber I was starved all ready, but I didn™t 
suffer all that much from hunger, but I 
reme mber I would say to my mother, 
ﬁMomika, I™m so hungry.ﬂ So, she would give me  her portion. I said, ﬁBut, did you 

eat? ﬂ  ﬁYes, yes, I am ful l .ﬂ She would 
say, but she was not, but she threw me  her 
portion because in the morni
ngs we would receive moldy bread, some  s ugar, some  
kind of a ma rmalade, and this was very bad because Œ this wa s bad because we all got 

diarrhea from it, and a ki nd of a coffee that didn™t tast e like coffee at least to me  as a 

child. It was terrible, but it wasn™t enough 
for me . So, I asked my mother, and she 
very often was able to throw me  her portion, 
and I ate, and I reme mber at that time, 
there was a Mr. Kaufma n who was a friend fr
om before the wa r. And, I went to him 
and I said to him in German, ﬁMr. Kaufma
n, do you happen to have a slice of bread? 
I™m very, very hungry.ﬂ He said to me , ﬁGeo
rge, I wish I had I could give you, but I 
don™t.ﬂ And, I™ll never forget th
is. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of 
the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he alwa
ys reme mbered this, and I reme mber this 
particular incident as well. But, it wa
s done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr. 
Kaufma n that I addressed him. It was not Ma
x or sort of the way we™re accustomed to 
here. Yes, and then, intere
stingly enough in this Tanklag
er, which was a tough place, 
there was a German gua rd by the name  of 
Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat 
the Jews like  anything. He came I think fr
om Romania or some 
place from that area, 
but he liked my mother, and would always 
address her as Fr au Dr. Schwab, and when 
he was patrolling, he would say, ﬁYou can go into this shackﬂ where there was a stove 

and what we confiscated. We  used to call 
it organizier, we organized some thing. We  
stole some thing Œ potatoes so we could sl
ice and put it agains
t the oven and roast 
potatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me  to go with my mother. So, 

we could go in. We  could warm-up, et cetera
. We  would have our potato so on and so 
forth. One day, we were ma rching toward th
e Tanklager again in the winter, and my 
mother told me  she had a terrible case of
 diarrhea and she doesn™t know what to do.  
_____ in German. She went over to him and said, 
ﬁI really have to step out.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁGo ahead.ﬂ He slowed down the column, per m
itted my mother to attend to what she 
had, and then she rejoined the column. W
hy did he do it?  I don™t know. My mother 
was gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish
-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans. 
Actually, she was told and that was still goi
ng back now in Libau, if she wanted to be 
saved to be taken to Germany, she c ould be 
saved. She said, ﬁI™ll be
 delighted if I can 
bring my sons with me .ﬂ They said, ﬁNo, 
you can not.ﬂ Then, she said, ﬁThen I stay 

with my sons.ﬂ And, that was still in Liba
u, because they distinguished some ti me s the 
genotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewi
sh versus the appearance, and if your 
appearance was ﬁAryanﬂ especially Nordic
, which my mother was, then you could 
ma nipulate, but she was actually asked.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
59 
 
Q:  She was asked? 
 

A:  Yeah, and there are other incidents like th
is after the war, immediately where people 
in Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she 

came to look for me , but ma ybe whe n we 
go into this, we can
 discuss it later. 
 

Q:  Now, is your brother living in this outer camp?  

 

A:  Yes, he was living in this outer ca
mp, and sometimes there was communi cation and 
you could ____ had little pieces of paper or
 whatever, and you could communicate. 
And, he communicated with my mother that
 it is possible to bribe the commandant 
Kohler of the reichsbahn where my brot
her was at to bring her and me  to the 

reichsbahn, and my mother said yes she is
 going to send for some  gold coins and fur 
coats. It was some thing in because certain of the things we ma naged to give  to a 

Latvian patient of my fa ther™s who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. His 

name  was Abelit, and he did come  through, this
 Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler 
and Kohler instructed my brother to get a me
ssage to me  that I should be in the camp 
on those three days and he will se nd a car fo
r me . And, indeed, but not for my mother, 
but for me . And, my mother 
said, ﬁAbsolutely you go. It™s ___ and don™t worry about 
me . I™ll be all right.ﬂ So, I went and joined
 my brother, but I was not the only one in 
the car. There was apparently a few more 
who had similar deals because he could be 
bribed. He was one who could be bribed. And, 
then my mother, we learned later, also 
went to an out camp to work camp called the SS ________, the SS vegetable garden 

for the SS et cetera. So, that™s where she wa
s, and then I saw my mother very briefly. 
We had word that she would passing th
e reichsbahn. I don™t know how we  got the 
word, through whom, but that at that time 
was a convoy that we should be at the gate 
or whatever, and we actually saw our moth
er for ma ybe two mi nutes. We  were just 
able to- 
 

Q:  And, did she see you as well? 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  She did? 

 

A:  Yeah.  When I came to the reichsbahn 
it was in co mparison to 
Kaiserwald, paradise. 
The food wa s slightly better, no beatings. I 
had an attack, I suffered appendicitis. I 
was there in the camp hospital for a couple of
 days until I got better. Incidentally, I 
was also in the Kaiserwald, had an attack 
there. And, a colleague 
of my father™s, Dr. 
Sik in Libau was the head of the hospital ove
r there. He said, ﬁGeorge, I™ll take you 

into the hospital.ﬂ And, he kept me  there.
 On the third day, he said, ﬁGeorge, you 
better disappear because there™s going to 
be inspection today and we don™t know what 
can happen. Do the best you can. Nothing is 
going to happen to you. Try not to work 
too hard or bend too hard.ﬂ And, I left, a
nd sure enough some of the sick ones were 
taken away and shot. But, the reichsbahn 
in comparison was not all that bad, food-
wise. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
60 
 
 
Q:  Who ran it? 

 

A:  It was run by the German reichsbahn, railroad. 

 

Q:  So, they- 

 

A:  And, the commandant, you could Œ you could 
talk to him. He could also scream. 
 

Q:  You could scream? 

 

A:  He could scream. 

 

Q:  He could scream. 

 

A:  He could scream, yes, but by and large,
 I don™t reme mber ma jor beatings or so, for 
example in the Kaiserwald, I remember 
having received once a smack in my face 
from the commandant Oberstrumbahnfuhrer Sa
uer. I saw stars in front of me . I was  
supposed to clear the snow from the walk
way, and I perhaps didn™t do it as quickly. 
So, he came out and said to me , ﬁHey, 
you Jew boy, why aren™t you working? ﬂ I said, 

ﬁI™m working,ﬂ And, he slapped me . I fell ma ybe ten feet away from the slap, and I 

just stars in front of my ey
es. This did not Œ was not the 
case in the reichsbahn, and in 
the reichsbahn what was my task, I began 
to ﬁhelp my brotherﬂ he was an auto 
electrician. He knew about a car electricia
n as much as I know about the Chinese 
language, and I was his assistant, and what 
we did, what we all did for example when 

we had to screw in some thing, we would sc
rew it in not all th
e way. It was our way 
of, ﬁsabotagingﬂ the German war effort. 
We  would always try to do things not a 
hundred percent, eighty percent. Hopefull
y, something will go wrong. But, when an 
SS ma n would come , and inspect, go around the big halls and inspect somebody 

would scream out ______, ________ meant six. For some  reason, I don™t know why 

six which meant inspector be careful. So, we all immediately- 
 

Q:  Got very serious. 

 

A:  -got very seriously this and that
 running around, ______ this
 was a code word. 
 

Q:  Did anybody ever get caught
 for not doing things right? 
 

A:  I don™t remember this. I don™t remember 
this, and then we had a wonderful Jewish 
couple, German Jewish couple who were work
ing there too, and he 
and his wife were 
the elders of this kasernierung Steinhart, Ed
ith Steinhart. I forget his first name . They 
were lovely, lovely people, and they were so
 to speak belonged to the German Jewish 
group in the camp, but were very good towa
rds us. There was a couple from Vienna, 

lovely people, Maier was their name . Mr. a
nd Mrs. Maier I reme mber, lovely, lovely 
people from Vienna. There were two German
 Jewish couples who were a little bit on 
the rough side, who became much rougher in St
olp, more to say about it. So, one was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
61 
 
Kentcourik fr om Lubek t he other was Gr
unwald, or Greenwald also from Germany, 
but I don™t reme mber from what part of Ger many. And suddenly, we knew that the 
Russians were advancing in the direction of
 Riga in the late spring of 1944. Suddenly, 
we come to the camp, return from our 
work which was only ma y about 200 yards 
from where we were living, and that we a
ll had to appear at an ______. That was in 
July 1944, and there was this SS doctor fr
om the camp, Krebsbach and his deputy, 
Wi sner and Kohler standing and we™re in th
is large hall and we were told to get 
undressed, get in line, and then there was a sele
ction Œ left, right, left, right, left, right. 

My brother was sent to the 
left, and I was sent to the 
right. But, my brother said, 
ﬁDon™t worry, Kohler is there. He knows 
what we have done.ﬂ So on and so forth, 
ﬁwe can do more, don™t worry.ﬂ My brother wa
s sent to the left. I was sent to the 
right, and I never saw my brot
her again. My mother saw hi
m still in Kaiserwald, and 
knew that he would be shot, and he said 
to my mo ther, ﬁDon™t worry mother. We™re 
going to take some  of the Germans and Latv
ians, our shooters with us.ﬂ My mother 
felt that she could have resc
ued him and begged him to come  to the fence, but he 
wouldn™t come . He didn™t want to upset my 
mother. So, he didn™t come to the fence 
to see her again, and that was 
the last we heard of him.  
 

Q:  So, he was sent back 
to Kaiserwald, and then they
 were going to shoot them?  
 

A:  Yes, and then from Kaiserwald, they we
re taken the Rumbala forest where they were 
killed, yes. 
 

Q:  Shot? 

 

A:  Yes, but it must have been at the very 
end of July or the very beginning of August, 
1944. The ones who survived, I came back to the barracks, we came back to the 

barracks, and I kept on Œ my brother was 
sleeping in the bunk bed next to mi ne. I 

said, ﬁBubbi, Bubbi, where 
are you?  Bubbi, Bubbi, wher
e are you? ﬂ And, I had a 
hunch that this was it. That I wouldn™t see 
him again, and he was taken probably to be 
shot, and I was alone now. It was at this 
stage that Julius Goldberg, who was in the 

same  barrack, et cetera, he said, ﬁGeorge, I™
ll take care of you. For as long as I will 
live, you will live.ﬂ And, Julius Goldberg 
was strong like an ox, very athletic, a 
yachtsma n before the war, very handsome  fello
w, at that time  proba
bly in his late 20s 
I would think. But, he slept 
over there, and I slept over here, and fine. A week later, 
we were take n to a ship. We were being 
evacuated because the Russians were comi ng 
close. We  were being evacuated, boarded th
e ship. That™s when we were taken to 
Stutthof in August 1944. And, it was a, I 
guess a troop carrier, what, I don™t 

reme mber what it was before the war. Maybe 
it was a liner or so, 
but at that stage of 
the game there were bunks all over the pl
ace, troop carrier, I guess. It was full of 

concentration camp inmates. So, I wa s 
looking. Maybe I would see Bubi. Maybe I 
would see my mother. And, we already 
had concentration camp garb by that- 
 

Q:  You mean striped uniforms. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
62 
 
A:  Striped uniforms, and I was looking up, 
and a woma n was looking down without hair. 
I didn™t know who it was without hair, and 
suddenly I heard a familiar voice sayi ng, 
ﬁGeorgenka.ﬂ My mother™s voice. She was looking down. She was without hair. They 
had taken her and shaved her hair, and ther
e was my mother. So, for the next three 
days we could see each other on the ship, a
nd the interesting thing is that while we 
were going through the bay of Riga, the Ru
ssians were shooting at the ship, but 
mi ssing us by a hundred or two hundred yards, 
and we just sailed through it, and the 
artillery shells would fall, go over the shi
p, fall on the other si
de ma ybe a couple of 
hundred yards from it, and we finally arrive
d near Danzig. We were put on the little 

railroad cars. What do they call them?  Th
e schma l spurbahn, the German. It™s not the 

regular, it™s- 
 

Q:  Were they ha lf cars?  

 

A:  Half cars, and not as wide. The railroad 
tracks were not as wide Œ lorries, kind of 
lorries, it™s almost a sort of
 a choo-choo train, et cetera. 
So, we were transported to 
Stutthof in August. That was Kaiserwal
d, however bad it was, was paradise in 
comparison to Stutthof. We were beaten. We  
had to work also on the railroad tracks 

over there, not far from t he gas chamber 
and crematorium we saw. We  already knew 
what it was. The chimne y burning all the ti
me , burning the bodies. So, we knew and 
the issue was how to survive there. F
ood was almost non-existent. We  we re all 
emaciated. We were all starving, but and I 
no longer saw my mother. I no longer saw 
my mother. 
 

Q:  I™m afraid we have to st
op there and change the tape.

Q:  George, we ended with 
your saying that you no longer were
 able to see your mother 
and comi ng into Stutthof, the Kaiserwald wa
s paradise in comparison with Stutthof. 
So, could you explain what was going on? 
 

A:  Well, the beatings were almost non-
stop now. The food was even worse than in 
Kaiserwald. When we worked on the tracks,
 we were beaten all the time by the 
Germans and by the non-Jewish couples, even
 though I learned what a louse me ans in 
Kaiserwald, and began the practice of delous
ing myself Œ the hair and over here and 
so call in the garb that we had. Now, we we
re full of lice in Stutthof. The facilities 

were terribl e. Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. For example, the toilet 

was a kind of an outhouse. It was a square pit, and was Œ on top of this what was 

constructed were columns. Columns  was a 
wooden ﬁbenchﬂ ma ybe six or eight inches 
and you would have to lift your
self up, that I never fell into
 the pit was a mi racle, and 
incidentally, there were some  kapos that were
 so bad that they were thrown into the 
pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples. But, in 
Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald 
from every point of view, especially the be
atings. Now, the interesting part was that 
the reichsbahn requested that 
the same  people be spent to St olp. So, I was part of it. 
 

Q:  So, you got out of - 

 

A:  I got of Stutthof. 

 

Q:  Let me  ask you some thing, George, when you say Œ what were they beating you 
with?  Do you reme mber ? 
 

A:  First of all, they would slap you, but then they also had whips Œ whips. They would 
beat you like you would beat a wild horse wh
en you want them to run or some thing to 
that effect. It didn™t ma tter if you were young 
or old, et cetera, a
nd the infirm were 
imme diately taken after the a
ppel to be shot, cremated. 
 

Q:  And, how were you strong enough to 
withstand this kind of treatme nt? 
 

A:  I always ma de myself ol der, and I alwa
ys made myself taller,
 and this was street 
smartness in a sense. Now, why was my brother taken? 
 

Q:  And, not you? 

 

A:  And, not me . Again, I resorted to the same
 tactic, but my brother used eyeglasses, and 
anybody who needed eye et cetera was alrea
dy concerned infirmed, which we did not 
know, or he would™ve hidden the eyeglasse
s. So, he was taken. I did not need 
eyeglasses. Yes, I was emaciated, but ev
eryone was emaciated, and however much I 
suffered from hunger pains, I suffered less 
than others because my father as a 
gastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted 
us to eat huge portions of anyt hing, never 
permitted us too much, too many of the fatty things. In between meals, we could have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
64 
 
a fruit or some thing. He  was strict about
 that Œ a fruit or so, but no _______ as we 
would call it, ma ybe a piece of this or  that, 
et cetera nothi ng. A meal is a meal. That™s 
when we can eat, but everyt
hing in moderate proportion. 
 

Q:  So, this was helpful to you? 

 

A:  This was very helpful because I could 
never gorge myself with food, because many of 
the people and that™s what I 
first learned Œ poor people gorge themselves very often 
believing that they had to put on layers of fa
t that would protect th
em fr om the natural 
Œ from the winters or  whatever, and this
 I only learned subs
equently. I was not 
conscious of it before the war, but only 
after the wa r people talked about the food 
habits in the camps, and those were my 
habits. However hungry I was, as I said 
before, I was not that hungry. The day of lib
eration, as I™ll tell 
you a little later, I 
mi stook soap for bread and I started to eat 
soap, but this was already on the day of 
liber ation which is st ill to come. 
 

Q:  So, are you in Stutthof for like a month, two months? 

 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  Not even that long? 

 

A:  Not even that long, probably not more 
than ten days or so the first time  around. 
 

Q:  Now, you turn 13. 

 
A:  I turned- 
 

Q:  In 19- 

 

A:  Later on, I guess in 19- wait a second. I 
had a birthday I reme mber, and this was in 
1944, was I 13 in 1944?  I guess so, but this was 
in Nove mber, much later. I was still 
now 12 in Stutthof.  
 

Q:  So, when is there this so
rt of semi -Bar Mitzvah party? 
 

A:  That was in Œ that was 
later. That  was in Novemb er. 
 

Q:  In 19- 

 

A:  ™44. 

 

Q:  1944. So, we™re still in 1944. 

 

A:  Yes, we™re still in 1944, in August, 1
944. And, suddenly we were transported from 
Stutthof to St olp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
65 
 
 
Q:  Right. 

 

A:  In passenger cars, railroad cars. 

 

Q:  Passenger cars? 

 

A:  Yes, and the feeling was that the Nazis 
didn™t want to show to their own people that 
you transport prisoners Œ this was our interpretation Œ prisoners in cattle cars. That 

was our interpretation. Whether this is true 
or not, I don™t know. And, that turned out 
to be a work camp, living right on the prem
ises in the reichsbahn right near the 
railroad, the ma in railroad station there. 
There I became a carpenter, and I know as 

much about carpentry as I know about Chines
e hieroglyphics. That I didn™t chop off a 
finger or some thing or other is still one of those mi racles because I have no sense for 

these things. 
 

Q:  So, what was your job? 

 

A:  Helping to repair cattle 
cars, transportation, et cetera. Some times you nee ded a board, 
so you had to do this. You do that. Don™t ask me what some how or another, and 

ma naged to do what was expected. 
 

Q:  You weren™t building furniture. 

 

A:  No, no, no I wasn™t building furniture. I was 
not an artist, along those lines. No. I was 
a plain, pl ain worker. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  The food wa s ma nageable over there, a
nd people who worked right near the tracks 
were able to organize someti mes potatoes,
 carrots, because they would fall off from 
the railroad tracks and smuggled into the 
camps and you could begin to trade a little 
bit here and there. So, you could augment th
e poor food that we got with some  of the 
extras, but a few months later, some  peopl
e did the same  thing, organize some  food, 
and they were caught by the Germans. A
nd, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a 
lesson that theft is punishable.  And, what 
they did was hang the people, and we were 
forced to ma rch to see the hanging, and th
en ma rch around the hangers to see them. 
How did I survive this one?  When it 
was announced hanging people, I didn™t 
understand what it means, how a person can 
hang. Again, it became interesting to me 
to look at the person hanging. I didn™t unders
tand that this is involved with death. I 
did not put two and two together. How 
can a person hang?  And, only while hanging 
did I realize that the person was hanged a
nd it meant actual death. I did not connect 
this before. So, to me  again, it was a kind 
of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you 
want to call it, or some thi
ng along those lines. Sick! But I 
reme mber the context very 
well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted?  And, 

my answer is, folly of youth, did not unde
rstand, and number two, and perhaps even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
66 
 
more important than this, curiosity because 
everything interested me  especially that 
what I didn™t understand. And, this happened th
ree, four months before our liberation 
when the Russians were already on German so
il, and also during this period in Stolp, 
the German Jewish couples began to beha
ve atrociously to the Eastern European 
Jews. When some body was caught organizing so
me thing internally or so, he had to 
receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewi
sh couples were only delighted to me te 
out the punishment. One  of them wa s Kent
courik who was particularly brutal. For 
some  reason or other, both of these c
ouples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me , 
ma ybe because I spoke their type of German, 
and left me pretty much alone this and 
that and were actually nice, but they were 
absolute Œ excuse me  for using the term 
here Œ bastards. And, I™m jumping now fo
rward for a mi nute. I was in the same 
hospital, after, right after the war as Ke
ntcourik, and I came out of the hospital and 
was brought back by the British to the rehab
ilitation, to the rehabi
litation barrack in 
the DP camp in Neustadt  in Holstein with one of the British Re d Cross cars, 
ambulance cars, and Kentcourik Œ I infor med
 the other guys who were there, fellows, 
many of them that I was liber ated with
 that Kentcourik was comi ng out. ﬁOh, 
Kentcourik is comi ng out. We ™ll beat the 
hell out of hi m,ﬂ and Kentcourik came in 

thinking that™s he™s comi ng in as a great her
o, and chairs flew into his face, this and 
that, so on and so forth. He was taken b
ack to the hospital seriously injured. He 
survived this, and after the war he had 
two daughters, moved with his two daughters 
to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don™t reme mber what happened to his 

other one, Gr unwald, but that was the fate of
 this German Jewish couple Kentcourik.  
 

Q:  George, when you™re walking around, how long did they ma ke you walk around these 
people who were hung?  Just once?  Twice? 
 
A:  No, no, no, we were standing at attenti
on walking, I would say about for an hour or 
so. 
 
Q:  So, it™s a long time. 

 

A:  Yeah, for us to be taught a lesson. So, they were hanging there. 

 

Q:  Do you think you also took this ki nd of position Œ not just, that it wasn™t just curiosity 
and interest in some thing new Œ and ignoran
ce because you were a 
kid, but also a way 
to protect yourself?  Or was that- 
 

A:  You can interpret it as 
such. It was a protective mech
anism perhaps. You could Œ I 
didn™t think along these lines, but I 
can see this, yes, I can see this. 
 

Q:  Was there- 

 

A:  But, not conscious. 

 

Q:  Yes, I understand. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
67 
 
A:  There was no conscious. 
 

Q:  That I understand, and wa s there an affect 
after looking at this for an hour that broke 
this sort of curiosity? 
 

A:  Well, I™ve been thinking about it ever si
nce this particular ep
isode. Hanging, et cetera, 
and when I watch the History Channel, and 
I see some of the Œ 
some of the things 
when Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci, and how they used to hang Russian 

prisoners, the German and so on and so forth, this always comes back to me , this 

scene of how I had to watch these people be
ing hanged. It™s some thing that stays with 
me .  
 

Q:  Stays with you. 

 

A:  Yes. Well, I guess you ca
n interpret my reactions to ma ny of the things in 
psychological terms as self-pro
tection et cetera. The whole 
approach being the theater 
of the absurd, but looking at it with today™s vocabulary and unde
rstanding et cetera, 

but at the time, of course, I did not- 
 

Q:  Right, you didn™t have that. 

 

A:  I don™t have this vocabul
ary and know this understanding. 
 

Q:  But, it must have been scary. At 
some point it had to be horribly scary. 

 

A:  Absolutely because I could be next. Ye
s, you never knew. Yeah, and, in Stolp I was 
sleeping in a bunk right next to Julius Gol
dberg. Again, everything straw, this and 
that, lice, delousing was an every evening 
activity. Bathroom facility better than 

Stutthof and Riga, but still Œ there was wate
r. You could wash yourself in the barrack 
which was a converted Œ the barrack was act
ually not a true barrack. It was for a 
steam engine that was converted into a 
kind of a barrack where we could sleep, bunk 
beds. And, then, the Russians were comi
ng very close and they were going to 
evacuate us, but before then, about the Ba
r Mitzvah. It was Eugenia Goldberg who 
was a nurse, and persuaded the SS woma n to
 let her do some thing for me . And, she 
ﬁbakedﬂ some thing from potatoes which wa
s the most delicious thing I thought I™d 
ever eaten because I was so starved Œ a kind 
of a potato pi e. She explained it to Sheila 

Robbins, ma ybe she would be able to expl
ain it to you what it was, and then the SS 

woman was present. I was permitted to co
me in from the man™s quart er including 
Julius Goldberg, her husband. 
 

Q:  Oh, it is the husband. They are rela
ted. That™s what I was going to ask you. 
 

A:  Yes, yes, that was a wife. 

 

Q:  Okay. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
68 
 
A:  Wonderful, wonderful woma n, and songs were sung by inma tes including one of the 
songs sung in English, La mbeth Wa l k, I reme mb er and the SS woma n ac tually 
enjoying it too.  
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah. It was ﬁvery fest
iveﬂ under the circumstances. 
 

Q:  That™s quite extraordinary. 

 

A:  Extraordinary, yeah. So- 

 

Q:  So this was your 13
th
. 
 

A:  Yes, I guess it was, yes. It was my Ba
r Mitzvah I guess, end of ™44. I™m confused 
with the dates sometimes a little because sometimes I was made older, sometimes I 

was ma de younger. So, I have to think 
about. It was nothing unusual in those 
circumstances.  
 

Q:  But it was in Stolp 

 

A:  It was in Stolp, yes. Now, it was not l
ong thereafter, a couple of months actually, I 
think it was in March, beginning of March or 
end of February when we were sort of 

dumped into cattle cars again, and we were 
returning to Stutthof  But, because the 
Russians were already nearby and my mother
 was already liberated nearby which I 
didn™t know. I found this out only after I me t 
her, we spent about a week in these 
cattle cars with hardly any f
ood, no fa cilities to speak of, in the corners we had where 
the stench was absolutely incredible. Finally, we came to Danzig and we di dn™t 

ma nage to get to Stutthof and we we re 
brought to another small ca mp Burggraben, 
and we ma rched. It was a long ma rch from Da
nzig to Burggraben. It was very cold, I 

reme mber. It was about easily, easily ten, tw
elve miles in our circumstance to march. 

We arrived in Burggrabben. It was knee d
eep in mud. There were no German guards. 
It was no man™s land between the Russian 
front and the German front. The Russians 
would shoot their artillery 
across our heads, and the 
Germans would shoot their 
artillery across our heads. 
 

Q:  And, you™re in the mi ddle. 

 

A:  And we were in the mi ddle. For about a week to ten days I would say with hardly any 
food, hardly anything to drink. 
 

Q:  You were just sitting there? 

 

A:  Sitting ther e. 

 

Q:  Watching? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
69 
 
 
A:  Watching what was happening. Wa tc
hing what was happening. Suddenly, German 
trucks appeared. This was in March ™45. We
™re hauled to those German trucks, and 
they took us to Stutthof back. 
 

Q:  Oh, you did get to Stutthof. 

 

A:  Yeah, the second time. Now, Stutthof th
e first time was paradise in comp arison to 
Stutthof the second time. Ra mpant typhoid, 
hardly any food, Russian plans attacking 
us, didn™t know that it was probably a cam
p or so. The ovens burning all the time, 
hardly anything to eat, people dying left and 
right, being shot left and right, Germans  
unleashing their dogs, police dogs. And, 
the police dogs biting people including 
Julius Goldberg was bitten like ma d. His feet
 swelled up, and we were there for about 
two weeks, maybe a little longer gi ve or take
 a week or so when suddenly the order 
came, ﬁEvacuation.ﬂ We ™re going to be 
evacuated by boat. And, again, we were 
hauled off in these mi ni-train, these mi ni
-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to 
barges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. 
And, then we were taken on these barges on 
the high seas Œ the Baltic, the North Sea. For 
the trip, we received 
a loaf of bread and 
some  water. That was it because we subsiste
d on sea water during the trip, salt water. 
SS Guards were guarding us, and if you ha
d to step out, you had to do it over the 
railing and into the water on these barges
, and you could see the SS Guards pushing 
people with their shoes into the Baltic or
 into the North Sea. I reme mber very 

distinctly I suddenly saw a German c o mi ng, 
passing me . I thought, well, this was my 
end, but it passed me  and didn™t do anything. 
And, we were down, et cetera. To climb 
up we had no strength left or anything of th
e sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean 
he was as strong as a bull. I™ve never seen
 anything like it in my life. And, suddenly 
we were told that we had arrived in 
Ha mburg, but I don™t think it was Hamburg, but 
this is what I reme mber, and that we had 
to get out very quickly for Hamburg because  
the Americans were in Ha mburg. It was actually the Brits, not the Americans, and 

then, we were taken back to the high s
eas, and at night the German guards abandoned 
us, and we were told that
 we were in mi nefields. 
 

Q:  On the high seas? 

 

A:  On the high seas, mi nefields, abando
ned and we didn™t know what to do. On our 
barges, were Norwegian POWs , and t hey collected the blankets we had still from the 

camp, and ma de sails out of them. And, ca me  cl
ose to, very close to the shore that we 
later learned was Neustadt in Holstein, a
bout 25 miles or kilometers from Lubek, and 
the decision was ma de Œ this was about four
 o™clock in the morning, five o™clock in 
the morning, May the third Œ that we would wade to shore and walk in the direction 

of Hamburg where the Americans are, and 
we™ll be liber ated. Julius was immediately 
for wading and was taking me  along. I said, ﬁJ
ulius please, please let me  die. I have 
no strength. Please leave me  alone!ﬂ I re
me mber Julius was stone. He said, ﬁNope, 
you™re comi ng with me ﬂ , and took me by the collar and dragged me . We had to go 

down, and actually in this very cold May in
 the North Sea, early morning, and I knew 
a little bit how to swim fr om 
the Baltic. I grew up on the shores of the Baltic. I knew, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
70 
 
et cetera, but I had no diffi culties wading to shore, and we all lined up and people 
took a long time  because there were several 
barges of people, and there were people 
still there who didn™t want to
 leave, and left very slow
ly, and suddenly, units of the 
German Navy arrive because it turned out th
at this was a U-boat school in Neustadt in 
Holstein, a huge U-boat school. Un
its of the German Navy arrived. 
 

Q:  Okay, I™ve got to - Hold that thought
 because we have to change the tape. 
 
End of Tape 8 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
71 
 
Tape 9
 
 
Q:  George, I want to go back to your scene 
with Goldberg. This is the first time that 
you™ve said, ﬁI want to die. Leave me  alone
.ﬂ You™ve never indi
cated in any of the 
ways you told your story that 
you wanted to die. Why now?  
 

A:  By now, I really fe lt totally, completely, totally exhausted Œ completely and totally 
starved because we were subsisting on 
sea water. How long can you subsist on sea 
water?  I just wanted to sleep because 
we were crowded in like herring, but he 
wouldn™t let go of me. 
 

Q:  That™s really some thing. 

 

A:  Yeah, and then when we finally waded 
there, when the German troops arrived from 
the ____ ma rina, from the naval units, they started shooting at random. People were 

still on the barges, wading toward the shor
e. People who were sitting, who were too 
weak to get up were shot imme diately. It 
was the day of liberation, incidentally. And, 

now another ma rch. We  were going to ma rch 
someplace, and I said to Julius, again, 
ﬁJulius, please leave me  alone! I want to
 die.ﬂ And, he was all swollen from the dog 
where he was bitten. He said, ﬁNoﬂ, and 
again he pushed me . And, the ma rch was not 
a long one, a couple of miles, and we arri
ved at this huge comp lex, a German U-boat 
school. There was a huge soccer field, and th
ere were thousands and thousands of 
people there from other camps. And, we were 
told that there is a ship by the name  of 
Cap Arcorna that we™re going to be put on 
that ship, and we will sale for I don™t 
reme mber where. I was semi -delirious and I 
was really starved, and in the shuffle in 

these thousands of people, I lost  Juliu
s. I wandered around. British pl anes were 
overhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona wa
s offshore, but there was another ship, 
the Athens, and we were supposed to line up 
and get onto the Athens to be taken to 
the Cap Arcorna. And, I wandered around still,
 and suddenly, I see 
a pile of things, 
and I was in a delirious state 
by then, a German guard lookin
g at it, guns Œ all sorts of 
things, and saw there what I would call t
oday Œ it was soap, but I mi stook it for bread. 
I picked it up and I started to eat it, and I 
couldn™t. I couldn™t bite
 it. I coul dn™t eat it. 
It didn™t taste like br ead. So, I threw it awa
y, and I walked over to the guard and said 
to him, ﬁMay I have a slice of bread?ﬂHe said, ﬁWhy don™t you walk over to this 

tank?  This is a British ta
nk. You have been liberated, walk over and you™ll get 
some thing.ﬂ So, I walked over to the tank. The British, I decided to speak English, I 

said, ﬁI™m very, very hungry. Can I please ha
ve a slice of bread?ﬂ
 So, they gave me  
these cookies, a number of cookies to eat 
because they didn™t have bread, but it was 
some  sort of cookies. 
 

Q:  Cookies or cracker? 

 

A:  Crackers. 

 

Q:  Was it a cracker? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
72 
 
A:  Those were crackers rather, not cookies,
 you™re right, crackers.
 And, we were free, 
and I saw the Athens there. In the me antim
e, just then, the Cap Arcorna was sunk by 
the British. Most of the people drowned, 
most of the prisoners drowned. A few 
survived included Sam Bressl
er and his father ____. And, some  way or other, I saw 
Julius again, and I saw pe ople stealing goods from the German storage places, food. 
They had huge gallons of ma r malade, I gue
ss for the soldiers, for the Naval people 
whatever, and people hauling, people ea
ting all over. Many died by overeating 
immediately. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  Imme diately, I was too weak to even 
carry that much, but Julius and I and some  
others went into a barrack and took ov
er the rooms. The bunk beds was clean, 
everything. And, that™s where we decided 
we™re going to be for the night, and we 
were basically free, but it didn™t mean anyt
hing to me  being free. I did receive some  
crackers, some thing else, et cetera. So, my
 basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and 

then I went out myself a nd I organized some
thing also one of those cans I ma naged to 

bring back. Suddenly, there™s a knock on th
e door and several Poles walked in, 
looked around, and said among the mselves, a
nd by then I knew so
me  Polish because I 
lived with Poles at the camps, ﬁThis is 
our place and out you Jew!
 Out! You out!ﬂ He 
didn™t say Jews, and the Jews said, ﬁYou bette
r get out or else.ﬂ And, Julius was in 
the forefront as sick as he was. Those days
 are over. They left quietly, and we stayed 
there. Now, while we were still on the barg
es, we heard the best news of all that 
Hitler was killed fi ghting the Russians. He was killed in Berl in. It was very, very late 

April. It mu st have been about the 29
th
 or 30
th
 of April, just a few days before we 
were liberated. We were liber ated on the third of May by the British. And, the day 
Germany officially capitulated, I collapsed 
out of total weakness and I was taken to 
the hospital in Neustadt in Holstein.  
The ma ny, ma ny other prisoners from Libau, 
from Riga, from Ger man Jews that I me t subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so 
forth were all there, and I stayed for a 
good numb er of weeks. I think four or six 
weeks I stayed there.  
 

Q:  Did you also collapse because of the appendix? 

 

A:  No, it had nothing to do. 

 

Q:  Nothing? 

 

A:  The appendix was finally taken out in 
Ha mburg, September or October 1945. I had an 
attack, but by then I was already on the 
Wa rburg Estate in ___. No, it was general 
weakness. I luckily did not suffer from di
phtheria, typhoid or any of these illnesses 
because as soon as the Ge rmans occupied Libau, my father said I™m going to give you 

certain injections against certain illnesse
s. These were not only injections over a 

number of days, I remember once he cut some
thing. It was a kind of a special type of 

a razor, and he had some thing Œ there wa
s some thing on the razor, and that was 
enough. I guess it was against t
yphoid or some thing or other, and then several other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
73 
 
things, and my mother escaped all of this
, and I escaped all of this. I didn™t have 
typhoid. I didn™t have diphtheria, and some  
of the other illne
sses associated, but 
especially typhoid and diphtheria.  
 
Q:  It™s quite extraordinary. 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  So, he must have had some  suspicion. 

 

A:  He must have had some- 

 

Q:  That it was not going to be good. 

 

A:  So, he wanted to ma ke sure at leas
t to immunize us as best as he could. 

 

Q:  Did he immunize himself as far as you reme mber ? 

 

A:  I would think so, but I don™t know. I would think so, yes. He immunized the rest of 
the family. So, why shouldn™t he immunize 
himself?  So, this was basically the 
liberation. 
 

Q:  It doesn™t feel like liberation. 

 

A:  Which doesn™t feel like lib
eration, and yet I was liberated. 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 

A:  Yeah, and thanks for Julius. If not fo
r Julius, I don™t think 
I would™ve ma de it. 
 

Q:  It sounds like it. It sound
s like you would™ve just dropped. 
 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  And, what do you think ma de Œ because he promised you he™d take care of you? 

 

A:  He promise d me  that- 

 

Q:  He would take care of you. 

 

A:  Yes, and this was nothing uncommon wh
en a kid was left alone. An older person 
would sort of volunteer. 
 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  To do it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493

Q:  And how old was he do you think? 

 

A:  Julius at that time was probably mi d or late twenties. 

 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  And he had a wife. 

 

A:  Yeah, that wa s Eugenia. 

 

Q:  Right, and did she survive? 

 

A:  She survived. She™s still living in Israel. 

 

Q:  She is now? 

 

A:  Yes, she™s still living in Israel Œ wonderful, wonderful person. 

 

Q:  When do you go to Wa r burg Estate in
 Ha mburg, and you don™t know yet. The first 
few months you don™t know whether 
your mother™s alive, right. 
 

A:  No, I had a feeling that she™s alive, bu
t where, what, when, et cetera, no. Before I go 
to the Wa rburg Estate, a group of Russian 
officers arrived with 
British officers tryi ng 
to convince me  to go ba ck to Latvia, go back
 to Latvia, go back to
 the Soviet Union, 
et cetera. The answer Œ my answer was a 
categor ical no because we ma de a pact, a 
fa mily, never go east, go back. You go. We
 have relatives in England, the United 
States, and we™re given a name  so on and 
so forth to reme mb er, but never go back, 
and I said, ﬁCategorically, I™m not going b
ack.ﬂ The British offi cers still tried to 
convince me  to go back, and a good number 
did go back. Some  of the m are now in 
Israel . After horror Œ after spending horribl e ti
me s in the Soviet  Union in La tvia until 

the ‚70s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me  that I 

wasn™t Jewish, despite the fact that I™m 
circumci sed, and put me , brought me , took me  
to a Latvian children™s home  where only 
Latvian was spoken, where some of the 
leaders were for mer patients of my fath
er, where they talked about Tievzeme  in 
Latvian, the Fatherland, how even
tually we™ll all go back to 
the Fatherland, et cetera, 
but this was a little bit strange to me  b
ecause we had Latvian guards. Some of the 
Latvians were innocuous. Others were horri
ble. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially 
Cukurs. I didn™t feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me Œ they had 

with a woman. This was in ____. She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers  

who apparently knew my father. General Da
nkers was one of the sympat hizers, Nazi 

sympathizers who ma naged to get to Lubek. 
He headed Latvian troops, so on and so 
forth. But, which I did not know exactly, but
 General Dankers just
 didn™t sound right 
that I should meet him. In Lubek, she wanted
 to take me  because apparently he knew 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
75 
 
my father, but when we needed the Latv
ians, they didn™t co
me  through those who 
were in the position to come  through. One 
day, when the head, this woma n, went to 
Lubek for a day or so, I decided to run awa
y, and I ran away and I ran all the way to 
the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein. _____ 
 the DP Ca mp.ﬂ But, this was a second 
time around, not the first time. The first tim
e I was brought back to the Œ I™m sorry. 
This was the second time  around because the first time after a few days I had a 
relapse, and I was taken b
ack to the hospital for anot
her twelve days. The second 
time, it was when they took me  to the 
Latvian children™s home, and after a few 
weeks, I ran away. I came to 
the camp which was in this U-
boat school, and I went to 
the bunk where I had originally brought b
ack, the rehabilitati
on bunk, and I™ve got a 
bed so on and so forth, and what were 
the people doing?  Pl
aying poker. Playing 
poker. Playing Œ what you call it?  They cal
l it 21?  Œ Blackjack, blackjack, and ma ki ng 
piles of money. In those days, the exchange
 rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I 
don™t know how I got a few Marks to play 
also. I figured, ﬁWhy not? ﬂ  And, I had a 
very good memory, and after a few days, I 
saw this and I knew every card that had 
gone out and so on and so forth. I began to pl
ay, and I piled in tens of thousands of 
Marks which translates into dollars, ma ybe 
it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but 
in Marks, it sounded enormous a mount, and then
 I decided that it™s time for me  to see 
the world. 
 

Q:  And, you™re what?  14? 

 

A:  No, thirteen. 

 

Q:  Thirteen? Okay. 

 
A:  To see the world. I had pl enty of money 
because the official rate if you went to a 
railroad st ation was still actually two or th
ree Marks or four Ma
rks for a ticket let™s 
say to go to Ha mburg. Now, I™m an a dult. I™ve
 seen it all I felt. I 
would love to live 
the life my a unts, my uncles, and my parent
s. To see the world Œ Berlin, Pa ris, night 
clubs, dancing, et cetera, that
 part of the world, and Neus
tadt was just a DP camp. So, 
I packed a fe w things that I had with my
 money, maybe by that 
time twenty, thirty 
thousand Marks which for Germans was an 
awful lot of money, got it all, and I 
decided to go to Hambur g. The reason bei
ng that we were told that we also had 
fa mily in Germany, part of the fa mily came from Ha mburg, and part of the fa mily 

came from Dresden. And, obviously, I didn™
t find anybody in Ha mburg, and I didn™t 
expect to find, but at least 
I got to Hamburg. I didn™t think it through would I go to a 
hotel?  Do I need this?  Do 
I need that?  Et  cetera, no. 
 

Q:  And, how did you get there?  By train? 

 

A:  By train. 

 

Q:  Okay.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
76 
 
A:  That was not a problem. I bought my  tic
ket. I went to Hamburg, and I reme mbered 
going to a police station sayi
ng, ﬁI looked for so and so.ﬂ I spoke German, and I 
didn™t know. So, I was taken to the Warbur
g Estate in _____, a suburb of Ha mburg 
which the Warburg family had temporarily 
given over to Œ I guess there™s a joint 

distribution committee of the American Relief 
Unit to turn it into a children™s home, 
just a small children™s ho me. I arrived there,
 and I was told, ﬁYes, I belong there.ﬂ So, 
that™s how I arrived. It must have been la
te summer or early fa
ll. I reme mber a few 
weeks later, getting an attack, appendix 
attack. I was operated on. I was all alone. I 
was scared, in the Altona Hospital in Ha m
burg. I spoke German. I told them that my 
father was a gastroenterologist
. I spoke German to them. The y were very nice to me , 
but I was still very much afraid. They we
re Germans. You don™t know what they can 
do to me . I thought at that time , and I alwa
ys reacted very poorly to ether, and I 
reme mber throwing off the ma sk in those days, but before the war my tonsils were 

removed also under ether and I reacted very 
poorly in Riga, and I threw off the ma sk, 
which I did again, but next thing I knew I cam
e out of the operati
on all right. I stayed 
for a number of days in the hospital. When
 I was brought back for further recovery to 

the estate. Now came the issue Œ there were several issues. First of all, to fi nd mother, 

and then I wa nted to go to Palestine b
ecause there were people from the Jewish 
Brigade in uniform and out of uniform, lega
lly and illegally, Ha mburg to train us. Not 
only to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel
, the history of Pa les
tine, Jewish History, 
also Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepar e also for Alijah Bet which 

was illegal immigration. And, the war to an
 extent, it™s only in retrospect that 
radicalized me . Why di d I su
ffer? I suffered because I™m 
a Jew. Is there anything 
really to be ashame d of being a Jew?  No, 
I was ashamed when I met the girl that I 
fancied on the street, and, you know, shame ca me
 over me  that I could not really talk 
and I really felt inferior which I never did be
fore.  But, this wa s a kind of a reaction I 
guess to my timidity at the time to having 
felt ashame d that I reacted the way I did, 
and was prepared to go to Palestine, prep
ared to take up a gun against the British 

because they were so horribl e al so to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in, 

giving ma ybe 1,500 certificates a month, and 
there were hundreds and hundreds of 
thousands and Jews who wanted to move to 
Palestine, so on and so forth, but this 
comes a little later. When it™s all started, a
nd my mother and brother, especially my 
mother said, ﬁYou go west, never go east.ﬂ 
You must reme mber your relatives in 
America, and in England. In London, reme mb
er your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab. I 
said, ﬁYes, of course. He visited us in 
Libau. I remember hi m well.ﬂ Reme mber to 
write si mply Robert Schwab, Director 
Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive  
because he was one of the heads of Shell 
Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the 
director of Shell Oil. So, I wrote, ﬁR
obert Schwab, London, England.ﬂ It all went 
through military ma il because you could not
 write. It went through the Joint 

Distribution Committee. It neve
r arrived. To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote, 
ﬁMr. David Alder.ﬂ He was ma rried to my
 cousin Anna Alder, who™s in this 
photograph who went to America, and there 
I wrote to Mr. Davi
d Alder, Director 
Shell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell 
Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of 

Shell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after le
tter. He disregarded it, but one day he 
decided to look up in the phone book in Salt La
ke City who this David Alder was. It 
turned out that he was the 
owner of an insurance compa
ny in Salt Lake City, David 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
77 
 
Alder Insurance Company. So, he called Davi
d Alder and asked him, ﬁDoes the name  
George Schwab mean anything to you? ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁYes, he is my wife™s cousin.ﬂ So, 
this was a first cont act. I wrote to my othe
r cousin in We st Hartford, Broskin, it never 
arrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. 
Broskin, Hartford, C
onnecticut. It never 
arrived.  But, this ma n, this one ma n, im
me diately contacted my uncle in London and 
contacted his sister, his wife™s
 sister in Hartford, Connec
ticut. So, they were already 
now in touch, but my mother knew to write 
the correct. So, she independently got in 
touch, and this way we connected. We we
re able to speak on the phone, on the 
military phone once a week. 
 

Q:  And, she was where? 

 

A:  She was liberated in Laue
nburg, it is on the ma p over ther
e, already in March, and she 
worked as a nurse in the Ru
ssian hospital. Then, she hear
d later on in May or June 
that there are a lot of Jews
 in Lodz, and ma ybe I am one of those who she could find 
in Lodz or get some information. Turns out th
at she arrives in Lodz
, gets off a trolley 
car and some body says, ﬁFrau Dr. Schwab in
 German. Frau Dr. Schwab. Frau Dr. 
Schwab.ﬂ ﬁYes, yes, who was it? ﬂ  It™s is
 Mrs. Dorbian the son come s now several 
times had come to Latvia. He™s my age.
 We  were together in _____. It was his 

mother. ﬁDo you know that George is alive in the British zone? ﬂ  She di dn™t ask, 

ﬁ Where?  When?ﬂ She was so overwhelmed, 
she ran back to Lauenburg, picked up 
her few things that she had, and went to Be
rlin almost penniless, come s to Berlin and 
Berlin was a second home to her because she ha
d been very often to Berlin before the 
war especially in the ‚20s and early ‚
30s. And, decided she wa s going to go to the 
Joint Dist ri bution Committee. She went to
 the Joint Distribution Committee. They 
wanted to test her, ﬁWho is she? ﬂ She didn™t speak Yiddish. She looked like a 
thousand percent Arya n. So, they were suspicious because ma ny wanted to do things, 
and she got away with no results, but she we
nt back to the Joint several times, and 
then there wa s a woma n who said to he
r, ﬁYou know Mrs. Schwab, I believe your 
story. I™m going to help you.ﬂ And, with the he
lp of this person, she was able to write 
to the United States be cause again, ever
ythi ng had to go through military mail, and 
through them she found out where I am which 
the Joint was able to connect me  then 
by telephone to my mot her because the Wa
rburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee 
and the American and the English Relief Unit 
were sort of the heads of the so-called 
children™s home  in the Warburg estate, were
 able to connect once a week. My mother 
went to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of 
course at the Wa rburg Estate, and it was pre-
arranged what time  we would be talking. So, 
we started to talk, a
nd in those days, it 
was not easy to go from Ha mburg fr om the British zone to Be rlin because you had to 

go to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the 

Soviet zone, and it took months
 before I was brought to Berlin. But, in the me anti me , 
when my relatives found out that I wa s al
ive, they started bombarding me with 
packages and money, and ever
y single letter was five do
llars, ten dollars, twenty 
dollars. Sometimes I received a packag
e a day. I didn™t know what to do with 
cigarettes and coffee, but they wrote me  th
ey coffee and the cigarettes are not for you, 
but we™ve been led to unders
tand that there™s a lot you can 
do with it in Germany. So, 
that™s for that purpose. Now, it ma y s ound ve
ry funny, but it™s true
. I felt that I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
78 
 
now an independent young ma n. I™ve gone th
rough the camps. I™m going to live the 
life of my parents, aunts and uncles. I am ri
ch. I have now all this coffee, et cetera, 
and among other things, I ma naged to get myse lf a driver with his car. He came to the 

Warburg Estate. He always picked me  up 
whenever I needed or wanted. I had my 

wine table in the Alhambra in the ____, it was 
a kind of a red light di
strict I went to in 
the evenings. For two cigare
ttes, I could get it at my 
age because it was my card 
l™dentitie.

Q:  Okay, George, so you™re now describing your
self as the reincarnati
on of that little kid 
who knows everything. Now, you™re a big pers
on and you™re all of what? Fourteen? 
 

A:  Not yet. 

 

Q:  Not yet fourteen. 

 

A:  Not yet fourteen. 

 

Q:  So, you have money?  

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  You have Œ what ma de you go get a car and a driver?  I mean, where does that come  
from? Is that really- 
 

A:  Yes, I don™t know how c o me  that I got that
 driver with that car. I don™t reme mber, but 
they used to come  around to Hambur g to 
______, and they had a car, and I started out 
by saying, ﬁI™ll give you a pack of cigarettes
 if you can drive me  here or there.ﬂ And, 
then they offered that anytime I wanted, 
I could have the car with a driver. There 
were two brothers, and they owned a fact
ory on the other side of Ha mburg, in 
Harburg with 200 people working, and they
 offered me , incidentally, to buy the 
factory for ten pounds of coffee and 40,000 cigarettes. 
 
Q:  That you should buy it? 
 

A:  Yes. So, I figured, ﬁWha t do I need a factory for?ﬂ 

 

Q:  Oh, really. 

 

A:  Yes, I did, ten pounds. I mean, I didn™t
 have at that mo me nt, neither 10,000 Œ 40,000 
cigarettes. Which meant, I don™t know,400 or 4,000 packs of cigarettes and ten 

pounds of coffee. First of all, I didn™t have
 it. I had ma ybe a  t
housand cigarettes or 
ma ybe two pounds of coffee, which was a lot 
in Germany at that time, but then I 
figured, ﬁWell, I could ask my
 aunt, but what am I going to
 do?  I want to have a good 
time.ﬂ And, I had now access to the Alhambra. 
With two cigarettes, you could get in 
any place. 
 

Q:  And, your age, it didn™t ma tter? 

 

A:  It didn™t ma tter with two cigarettes. Th
at™s what we  called a Ca rte D™identite, and 
identification card. 
 

Q:  And, you had your own table? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
80 
 
 
A:  I had my own wine table there, and it
 was very interesting, fascinating because you 
had a kind of a telegraph system there with
 tubes. If you sat at
 table fifteen, and you 
wanted to dance with some body at table eight
een, you wrote a little bit, ﬁLet us me et 
in the center of the dance floor, fifteen.ﬂ 
And, I just had to wr ite ﬁEighteenﬂ and it 
would arrive by tube, and then we would meet
 or some thing or other. I knew about as 
much about dancing as I know about the ba
llet dancing (laughs)
, but I learned, et 
cetera, and because one of the things that I reme mbered very well became the rage  in 

Latvia before the war in the late ‚30s wa
s the Tango, and a particular type of Tango 
Naturno. It was one dance, and the Lamb
eth wa lk. People we nt crazy tangoing and 
Lambeth wa lking. So, I was sort 
of going to live their lives. 
 

Q:  I see. 

 

A:  There™s a German expression Kleiner 
Mann Wa s  Nun?  It was a novel written by, I 
forget the author™s name, ﬁsmall man, what 
now? ﬂ In other words, looking at it in 
today™s terms, at that time, 
I didn™t know about the author
 nor about the novel Kleiner 
Mann Wa s Nun, and I in the evenings were 
not really supervised as much at the 
Warburg Estate. As long as we were there in
 the morning for hitamulut is what they 
called it in Hebrew, the exerci ses, callisth
enic exercises, appearing in class, doing 
some  home work. We  didn™t take studies ve
ry seriously. Much more interesting was 
when we learned a little about how to sm
uggle arms, and this and preparing for Alijah 
Bet, not to sit with this dry stuff mathema
tics or, so, who needed it. Anyways, in the 

meanti me , Julius Goldberg me t up with his wife. She was liberated in Cologne Œ in 

Kiel, sorry, in Kiel. And, she was in one of th
e barges that didn™t come  to Neustadt in  
Holstein but went to Kiel. And, then he became Norbert Wollheim™ s driver. Norbert 
Wollheim became the head of the Jews 
of the British Zone . And, Norbert was 
headquartered in Lubek, Germany, a nd Juliu
s would drive him when he had to go to 
Kiel, to Hamburg, or to ____. So, usually 
when Julius had to drive him t o ____, he 
had to go by way of Ha mburg. So, Julius w
ould come to ____ with Wollheim, pick 
me  up, take me  to _____ to the DP camp wher
e I me t Yosele for the first time , Yosele 
Rosensaft, Manachem™s father, for the firs
t time. That was in ™45 still. And, then 
would drive me  back either to or at time s 
take me  all the way to Lubek where I stayed 
at the Wollheim home with his first wife, 
beautiful woman incide
ntally, and that™s 
how I reconnected with Julius. This is how
 I reconnected with Eugenia. They were 
living in a DP camp in Kiel at the time, and I 
visited them also in Kiel if Juluis picked 
me  up. I saw Eugenia for the first time sin
ce the liberation. And, in the me antime in 
Ha mburg, I did this. I did that. 
 

Q:  Are you still playing cards? 

 

A:  No, I didn™t play cards. 
I didn™t need to. I ma de my m
oney in Neustadt in Holstein 
playing cards. 
 

Q:  That was enough? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
81 
 
A:  It was enough. I had plenty of money. 
 

Q:  And, are you still getting money from relatives?  

 

A:  Yes, getting money in every single en
velope, I had at any time, I had at least a 
hundred dollars in cash. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  At any time because in every single e
nvelope there™s five dollars, ten dollars, 
sometimes twenty dollars comi ng fr om especi
ally from my cousins in West Hartford 
and Salt Lake City, and some times I would 
get two or three letters a day Œ a week 
from each of them. In every envelope, there 
was five dollars or ten dollars or twenty 
dollars. 
 

Q:  Do you have a lot of self-confidence now? 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  You do? 

 

A:  Very much s o. 

 

Q:  You feel very sure of your
self as a kid there, right? 

 

A:  As a kid. 
 
Q:  I™m not talking about right now. 

 

A:  Oh, I thought right now. 

 

Q:  No. 

 

A:  Ah? 

 

Q:  No. 

 

A:  I didn™t think of it in those 
terms, but the answer is  yes. 
 

Q:  Because you seem to have a way of getting around and figuring out things and... 

 

A:  Yes, because  I was living the life of my parents and my relatives. 

 

Q:  Do you take any Œ do any of the other ki
ds do what you™re doing that you™re with?  Or 
are you alone? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
82 
 
A:  I was pretty much alone. 
 

Q:  You were pretty much alone? 

 

A:  I was pretty much alone. 

 

Q:  I have tell you, I can barely fantasize it at your age. 

 

A:  No, I was pretty much alone, yes. I ha
ve a photograph with my drivers in Ha mburg. 
 

Q:  Yes, we™ll show that. 

 

A:  You have them. 

 

Q:  Yes. 

 

A:  So, what was your question? 

 

Q:  Well, it™s just that  it™s 
a kind of self-confidence. It™s no
t clear to me  exactly where it 
come s from, but you obviously have a fa
ntasy of what life ought to be. 
 

A:  Just fantasy as it was. 

 

Q:  And, you wanted to live it. 

 

A:  I was living a fantasy, but I fanaticized 
before the war because I found it very, very 
exciting when they talked about when my moth
er and father were for the first time  in 
Paris in 1928 at Maxime ™s when the dinners 
my parents attended in the private home, 
the private residence of my aunt in Ber
lin, for the diplomatic core, where Hindenburg 
would say to my aunt, ﬁYou are 
my Garbo. You have to sit next to me .ﬂ et cetera. She 
was very strikingly beautiful woma n. She ba
sically looked like Garbo, and the whole 
lifestyle that we lived was a kind of a fair
y tale which I never 
lived again because I 
didn™t have any means. But, as a child I at
 least fanaticized right after the war and 

whatever I could, I did. Then, came the day wh
en I was brought to Berlin to meet my 
mother. 
 

Q:  Wait a second, on the telephone didn™t 
you ask her about night
clubs in Berlin? 
 

A:  No, it was Œ that is comi ng. I™m coming to
 this one. In the car, I was taking by the 
Joint finally in May 1946 to Be
rlin. I was thinking, ﬁDo I really want to go and meet 
my mother?ﬂ 
 

Q:  Interesting. 

 

A:  Am I going to live the old lifestyle agai
n with governesses who 
are rigid Œ a certain 
rigid approach?  Because now
 I™m a ma n of the world. I had my own car. I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
83 
 
money. I was able to do as I pleased. I™m not
 so sure that I want to see my mother 
again especially if she would insist on th
e same  type of rigidity, not the walls, but 
rigidity to which I was accustomed to. So, wh
en we arrived fi nally late in the evening, 
my mother lived privately, not in a DP 
camp, we lived privately in Berlin, I was 
brought up and the person Œ her name was Selma  from the Joint Distribution 
Committee from the Bronx, lovely, lovely wo
ma n Œ and I saw my mother, and I gave 
her pro forma, a kiss, and she gave me  pro 
for ma, a kiss, and the first thing I asked 
her was, ﬁTell me , mother, what is the nightcl
ub situation like in Berlin? ﬂ  I wanted to 
show her who am I. She looked at me  and 
said, ﬁThat™s a very interesting question 
that you™re posing. Did you know that until 
now, I was here all alone in Berlin, but 
now that you are, we™ll be ab
le to explore it together.ﬂ Sh
e disarmed me on the spot, 
and I was satisfied with the answer andwas looking forward to a life in Be rlin. 
 

Q:  So, did it turn out to meet the fantasy? 

 

A:  It turned out, yes, but rather than 
going to nightclubs, we went to some  very 
interesting cafes. We  didn™t go to a caba
ret. I don™t reme mber , no, because I don™t 
think I could get in in those 
days, but I dragged my mother
 literally to two to three 
movies a day, two to three movies. 
 

Q:  A day? 

 

A:  A day, sometimes from on movie out 
into the second. Later on in New York, my 
mother said, ﬁ Well, when you came and you had a problem.ﬂ But, she was really 

wonderful. For example, she decided to sl
eep with me  in the same room. I had 
nightma res, and she would jump up a
nd calm me down from t he nightmares, 
ﬁEverything is fine, George, we
™re together.ﬂ And, I went ba
ck to sleep, but lasted for 
months and months and months. And, then she said, ﬁGeorge, I™ll do everything 
possible in my life to make life as wonde
rful for you as possible for you to forget 
these horrible years.ﬂ And, she did it. But, 
then when she saw that she had a problem, 
she said, ﬁGeorge, let™s go, there™s a DP ca m
p. There™s some sort 
of a school, and you 
ma y meet interesting people there.ﬂ And, 
I was always interested in me eting 
interesting people. I didn™t 
cherish the idea of a school, but
 let™s go and 
look at this. 
And, lo and behold, I went to this school where Renia was my  classmate. I was the 

youngest in my class. 
 

Q:  Schlachtensee. 

 

A:  Schlachtensee, exactly, I traveled everyda
y by elevated from where we lived privately 
in Berlin to Schlachtensee camp and then I went back because  in Hambur g, we were 

all juvenile delinquents, and we
 didn™t take classes all that seriously Œ spitballs. We  
used to shoot spitballs at th
e teachers. So, I thought we™d 
do the same  in Berlin which 
to an extent we did. We  were not _____, 
and didn™t have schooling for how ma ny 
years?  Four or five years. I was a semi
-literate buffoon with high falooting ideas. 
 

Q:  You lived a very brutal life. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
84 
 
 
A:  I lived a very brutal life, yes. That is tr
ue, but ther e were some very attractive gi rls in 
the other class including Renia, and he
r two girlfriends, Tunia and Rachelka 

Feigenbaum. 
 

Q:  And, Renia, Chris™s- 

 

A:  Chris™s sister. 

 

Q:  Chris™s sister, Laks. 

 

A:  Laks. 

 

Q:  Renia Laks. 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  You were close in age with here. 

 

A:  She™s older than I. 

 

Q:  A little by a couple- 

 

A:  Three, four years older than me . 

 

Q:  I thought it was less. 
 
A:  No, and I was the youngest, and they us
ed to go the ____ to all these places, and I 
wanted to tag along because af
ter all, I have from the ba
sis of my experiences, and 
Renia would dismiss me  as th
is little jerk schnesel, ﬁH
e wants to go with us.ﬂ And, 
the other young ladies, a
ttractive young wome n laughed at me , and I felt very 
insulted, and I say to Renia even now, ﬁI 
still haven™t forgiven you.ﬂ (laughs) We  
have a good laugh over it, but at 
that time , I took it very, very
 seriously. They just sort 
of dis missed me  as, ﬁThis lit
tle jerk wants to join us
 ladiesﬂ going to the ____, going 
to the Fifth Avenue of Berlin, to the exclus
ive places where they went, et cetera, as if 
I was a zero, so to speak. 
 

Q:  Did you and your mother talk about wh
at had happened to each of you when you 
separated? 
 

A:  Over the years, yes, we talked a lot. 

 

Q:  But, not in the beginning. 

 

A:  Not at the beginning. She wanted me  Œ 
she desperately wanted me  to forget, to 
involve me in other things, to
 involve me  in other things. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
85 
 
 
Q:  She was really smart with you, wasn™t she? 

 

A:  Yes, she disarmed me  a nd she became  mo
re like a pal going with
 me to the movies. 
Later on in New York, she would say, ﬁI 
thought I was going out
 of my mi nd at 
timesﬂ, she would say to me . So, but, these 
were also formative years. These were 
also the years, where I became very much involved in betar. I don™t know if you 

know anything about betar, the revisionist out
fit. I went in eventually to the Stern 
gang. I was really radicalize
d, but this is a chapter in
 itself post World Wa r II. 
 

Q:  And, I think we want to take a brea
k now. Did you like being 
in classes with the 
Jewish Brigade? 
 

A:  Yes because there are certain things 
I learne d which I did not know before Œ the 
geography of Palestine, the histor y, the A
lijah bet, the British policies towards the 
Jews, the ____ which I did not know anyt
hing about in Russia that led to the 
establishment of the first ___, the first ____a
mo ng others, how the Jews turned this 
wasteland into a thriving co
mmunity. We  saw pictures of
 Tel Aviv, wonderful, and I 
was very anxious to go to a warm climate 
because during the war in the wi nter years 
when it was freezing cold, I swore to myself th
at if I were ever  to survive, I will go 
and live in a country that has a warm clim
ate. Never again do I want to experience 
winter, and here I am in New York. 
 

Q:  You are, right?  (laughs) 

 

A:  Yes, and then of course we began to
 study Hebrew, too, and I 
picked up a smattering 
of Hebrew, the alphabet, sentences here, sent
ences there, so on and so forth, which 
was good because later on I joined the Stern, a
nd then I studied in Israel for a while in 
the early ‚50s. 
 

Q:  Did you want to go to Pa lestine? 

 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  Before leaving Europe and you wa
nted to go directly
 to Palestine. 
 

A:  I wanted to go directly to Palestine, if
 need be, fight. I wanted to Œ we were being 
prepared in Ha mburg for Alijah Bet, 
illegal immi gration 
because of the- 
 

Q:  And, you were being trained to fight. 

 

A:  We were being, not as yet trained to fi
ght, but we did smuggle some  radios, this and 
that that we ma naged to pick up. Nothing ve
ry dangerous so far as guns or so, not at 
this st age of the game, a little later, yes. 
 

Q:  And, does your mother know
 that you™re doing this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
86 
 
 
A:  My mother didn™t know a thing. 

 

Q:  She- 

 

A:  No, she was in Berlin. 

 

Q:  So, this is before. 

 

A:  This is before, yes. 

 

Q:  This is in __________ 

 

A:  Yes, this is in _______________. 

 

Q:  Right. 

 

A:  So, life on the estate was 
wonderful. We  had socials. I wa
s always looking forward to 
the socials, the dances, and with certainly
 what they call in Hebrew _______, the folk 
dances where the girl has to come  and pick you up rather than you to the girl, which I 

liked very much, and I Œ no it was very nice, actually. 
 

Q:  So, when you went to Berlin, and 
you™re going to the sc
hool Schlachtensee- 
 

A:  Schlachtensee 

 
Q:  Schlachtensee, do you still want  to go to Palestine?  Or are you giving that up a little 
bit?  
 
A:  I am Œ my mother began to talk to me , a
nd she always said even out of context to me  
a ma n without an education is no ma n. It didn
™t register very mu
ch. I thought myself 
of being highly educated. 
 

Q:  Right of course. 

 

A:  The illiterate that I was, and then she 
loved to read books, and she would say to me , 
ﬁI don™t understand George, how anybody can
 go through life without reading a 
book.ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m not interested, period. I 
wasn™t interested in studying. I wasn™t 
interested in reading. I was in
terested in enjoying life, what life has to offer. Then, 
she said, ﬁLook, until age 21, I™m in charge of youﬂ, but she di dn™t put it Œ she put it 

in very di plomatic, polite language, ﬁand before you can ma ke  up in your mi nd if you 

want to go to Israel, but I want you to come
 with me to America 
where you can get an 
education. Here in Europe , and you see what 
Europe is like, we will be lost. There™s 
an opportunity. At least you™ll get an e
ducation.ﬂ  And ﬁ Where are going to in 
America? ﬂ She said, ﬁNew York.ﬂ Well, Ne w York was interesting. I reme mbered the 

films, the speed, the si ze, the skyscr apers, some of the films. The idea was intriguing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
87 
 
provided, of course, that eventu
ally I can go to Palestine, to
 fight if need be. She said, 
ﬁThat™s fine, after 21.ﬂ In the meantime, she would have me , obviously, for six, seven 
years, I guess to brainwash me . So, we deci
ded that we would go to America, and my  
cousins provided the visas, and actually they
 paid for us to go second class, business 
class on either the Queen Mary or the Queen
 Elizabeth, and the Joint pr omised that 

tickets would be issued for us for to go 
on the Queen Mary or  Queen Elizabeth. We  
would go by way of Paris to Marseilles
 Œ yeah, Marseilles I think it was Œ 
embarkation and Œ no, not Mar Œ I don™t reme
mber the port, and the Joint ﬁpocketedﬂ 
the money. 
 

Q:  Really? 

 

A:  Yeah, but my cousin said later on, ﬁLet™s
 forget. They used it for others.ﬂ And, we 
went on the SS Marine Pe rch which was a 
troop carrier. That was in March 1947. We  
left  Berlin together with the Lermans. 
 

Q:  This is Miles Lerman. 

 

A:  Chris Lerman. 

 

Q:  And Renia Laks, who is the sister of Chris. 

 

A:  Chris™s yeah, and my mother
 and I. We all went together
 to Bremin. We  all sort of 
lived together. Aboard ship, Miles and I,
 we were bunking together, and my mother 

was bunking with Renia and Chris. So, the twel
ve days, we were al
so together aboard 
ship, and then we landed in New York. A
nd, I was very disappointed because I was 
told in Berlin, the night before, you can al
ready see the lights of New York. So, the 
night before, I stood on the deck looking fo
r the lights of New York, and I didn™t see 
any. It was a clear night, and I beli
eved it, and then we docked on 42
nd
 or was it 44
th
 
Street and Twelfth Avenue, and these were
 shacks. I was so disappointed, and it was 
a mi sty morning. I didn™t see any skyscrapers.
 I just saw the West
 Side Highway. This 
was my first shock of the new world. 
 
Q:  You thought it was all a fake. 

 

A:  No, I didn™t think it was a fake, ﬁWhere 
is it?ﬂ et cetera, and 
we were awaited there 
by some  relatives who took us to Brookl
yn actually, Borough Park where we stayed 
for six weeks, and my mother di dn™t like it.
 So, we moved to Manhattan. But, I loved 
it in Brooklyn in the meantime. I was regist ered there in the New Utrecht High 

School in Be nsonhurst, and there I fell into an 
interesting group of 
Jewish activists, so 
on and so forth, and one thing led to the other, but this is now comi ng to the United 

States, already in the United States. 
 

Q:  Brooklyn doesn™t have many skyscr
apers in comparison with Manhattan. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
88 
 
A:  That™s right. Brooklyn didn™
t have any. There was a Hotel 
St George, I think that was 
about twelve or fifteen st
ories, but nothing like the Empire State Building. 
 
Q:  How was your English then?  Wa s that okay? 

 

A:  Pretty good. It wasn™t good, but I 
would say it was pr etty good. I understood, 
some ti me s. That™s an interesting story about
 going to school. It was obligatory of us 
to get a high school degree, and I lived in 
the district in New Ut
recht, and it was an 
uncle by ma rriage that took me  to New Ut
recht, to Brooklyn, and in Bensonhurst, and 
I was overwhelmed by the most gorgeous teachers in the world who looked to me  like 

seventeen, eighteen, but where actually Œ they
 were actually seventeen, eighteen, but I 
figured they must be in their late 20s or
 30s because they had ma nicured nails. In 
Europe, this was forbidden for students. No lipstick permitted, no powder, no 

ma scara, or anything. So, I thought that they 
were all teachers. I 
said, ﬁMy god, this is 
going to be interesting.ﬂ 
 

Q:  And? 

 

A:  And I registered. I was registered and I 
star ted only to fi nd out that  they were all 
students, wonderful, one more gorgeous than 
the ot her, especially the Italian girls. 
They were young, they™re absolutely gorgeous
, and I skipped a lot 
of grades. Hebrew 
from - they tested me and put me i mmediat
ely into Hebrew six, th
e last seme ster. So, 
I got credits as a foreign language. English, I 
started with English one. They put me  in 
the most fundamental course, but was transferred shortly thereafter to English three. 

So, I managed to skip a number of grades
. History Œ World War 
II history, I didn™t 
read about it, but I knew more than the kids 
in class. In short, 
I graduated high school, 
which I would have never been able to do 
in the gy mnasium in less than two years, 
New Utrecht High School. To my mother, this 
wa s heaven. At least, I have a degree 
now. Now, l e t™s see where we go from here. 
 

Q:  Let™s st op the tape. 

 
End of Tape 10 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
89 
 
Tape 11 
 
Q:  Okay, just a couple of things about what
 people™s impressions of Europeans were like 
when you came. So, the people thought that 
you lived a very primitive life, I gather. 
 

A:  Yes. First of all, I heard the fi rst time the term ﬁcootﬂ 

 

Q:  ﬁCootﬂ 

 

A:  ﬁCootﬂ and I came home  to my uncle and 
aunt, and I said, ﬁThe girls say that I™m a 
coot. What does it mean? ﬂ  Cute, but as I 
understand it, and never knew the word cute, 
that I was cute. They tho ught I was cute, et cetera. 
 

Q:  Well, that™s nice. That mu
st have ma de you feel very good. 
 

A:  Yes, I was delighted, and I sort of re
ciprocated. I don™t know what term I used, but 
then it was very interesting. I had a scie
nce teacher who in one day said, ﬁLook how 
advanced we  are and how backward Europe 
is. In Europe, the people don™t even have 

eyeglasses.ﬂ I raised my hand and said, ﬁN
ot so, my brother wore eyeglasses. There 
were eyeglasses. I saw ma ny peopl e with eyeglasses.ﬂ ﬁOh, you™re dreami ng. 

Certainly not in those days before the war, ma ybe now here and there, but there were 

no such things as eyeglasses.ﬂ And, he ha
d eyeglasses and some  of the students had 

eyeglasses. We have eyeglasses. Then I re
me mb er some  of t he friends that I ma de 
over there, I visited their home s in Bensonhur
st and in Borough Park, and they said to 
me , ﬁLook e l ectricity.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ And, 
they were surprised that I was nonplussed 
by it because they said, ﬁIn Europe, you don™t ha
ve this.ﬂ I said, ﬁWe had electricity.ﬂ 
So, they were thinking that I was spinning, or
 running water or things like these, and 
when they asked me  how I lived, and origin
ally when I explained, they thought that I 
was fibbing. So, I decided to shut up, and 
just listen and not say anything because 
what I encountered here were I guess mi
ddle class people who had no inkling what 
another type of lifestyle ma y be, and my
 mother did the same. Only among her 
friends, she had plenty of friends here fr
om pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes, 
the homes of my relatives, et cetera wh
ere the surroundings were sumpt uous. So, in 
this milieu, I kept my mo uth shut because they just didn™t believe me. 
 

Q:  Did your mo ther speak English when she came here? 

 

A:  Her English was not as good as mi ne b
ecause she grew up with French, and English, 
she did not participat e di rectly in the tutori
als that my brother and I had in Libau, but 
she was a voracious reader, 
started immediately to read
 the newspapers, started 
imme diately to read some  of the easy novels
, English novels, and picked it up, picked 
it up. 
 

Q:  Did she play cello when she came here? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
90 
 
A:  No, she actua lly thought of
 getting a job at Radio City 
Music Hall because  the person 
at that time , his nickname 
was Pipke. He was a friend of the family way ba ck in 
Latvia. What was his name , and he was the head of the mus i c of the orchestra in 
Radio City Music Hall. He converted ____ a
nd my aunt, I reme mber, telling the story 
before the wa r, and I saw Pipke in a tr
ain going from Berlin to wherever she was 
going, and suddenly Pipke is there with a bi g cross, and I said, ﬁPipke, what are you 

doing with this cross? ﬂ And, he said, ﬁ Well,
 this and that. So on and so forth, et 
cetera, et cetera.ﬂ But, my mother went 
to see him, and he knew that my  mother 
played, but she said, ﬁLook, I didn™t play for 
years. It could take meﬂ et cetera, and 

then he said, ﬁI can offer you some thing fo
r maybe thirty dollars a month in those 
days or so. She figured because we were living on an allowance from the Joint at that 

time, and my mother didn™t want to keep
 on getting money fr om my relatives. She 
wanted to be independent and we did not Œ 
later on we found some  moneys back that 
we had in Europe, but it was a 
few years later. So, it was tough, but she said for thirty 
dollars, I can™t ma ke ends meet, et cetera. 
So, she declined, and I guess he was just as 
happy that she declined. I assume , but he was 
prepared to give here Œ but, she had a 
very rare cello, my mother, by name  Œby a ma n name d Schweitzer who did ma ny, 

ma ny cellos, but only two cellos for wome n, an
d my mother had one cello of the two 
which were taken by the Germans, a nd sh
e got it from my gr andparents when she 
began the music conservatory, this cello. I 
often claime d, and I don™
t know if I™ll ever 
see anything by it, but the Germans c
onfiscated this as well, this cello. 
 

Q:  So, did she end up working? 

 

A:  Yes, she actually for a while, she alwa ys 
loved to stitch ma ybe 
a pillow or some thing, 
and she was offered something if she wanted 
to do even at home , if she wants to do 
some  stitching on me n™s jackets, working 
piece work. So, she took this and ma de 
some ti me s a hundred dollars a week, which wa
s a lot of mone y in those days in the 
late ‚40s, but once we starte
d finding some  of our funds 
back, not the ma jor ones, et 
cetera. So, things began to be easier. The 
first couple of years were difficult years, 
yes. 
 

Q:  But, then it got easier? 

 

A:  Then it got easier. 

 

Q:  When did you join the betar? 

 

A:  Through the friends that I ma de in, at Ut
recht, New Utrecht. It was a very heavily 
Jewish group over there, quite radical, that accorded with my  tastes, and I became 

very active in betar in the Borough Park Ch
apter, and then the 
issue became  whether 
to join ____ or the Stern, and there was 
a tremendous discord over one issue Œ the 
bombing of the King David Hotel. The issu
e was to forewarn the British or not 
forewarn the British. _____ insist ed that it was right to forewarn the British even if 

they would not take the warning seriously. 
 As it happened in the case of the King 
David Hotel, but so that the innocents w
ill not suffer. The Sternists argued that all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
91 
 
Brits are our enemies, look what they™re 
doing to us, hardly permitting any Jews to 
mi grate to Palestine, and we are not goi
ng to forewarn the Br its. And, I was so 
radicalized over the issue of Jewishness, 
even though I knew relatively little what it 
meant, that I joined Stern, and there we 
seriously trained for 
all sorts of things 
including assassination. Interest
ing, before I quit Stern, that
 was a chapter in itself 
because I was nearly shot for it Œ before I 
quit Stern, we were going to assassinate Sir 
Gladywn Jebb. Sir Gladywn Jebb at that time 
with a British rep at Lake Success at 
____. Why were we going to assassinate him,
 like we assassinated Lloyd Moyne in 
Egypt in 1944?  Assassinated 
Bernadotte?  Because, not be
cause he was not a nice 
person. He was actually a very nice person, 
but he represented Britain, Britain™s 
policies toward the Jews in Palestine. So, 
he was a target, but for various reasons, I 

quit the Stern group. There 
was a court proceeding. 
 

Q:  You were court ma rshaled? 

 

A:  In a sense, yes, court ma rshaled for quitting, so on and so forth. But Œ and we were 
trained here on a farm in Jersey. Does 
the name  Josephson me an anything to you?  
Josephson wrote the book, ﬁThe Robber Baron™sﬂ
, his brother, I think it was Murray, 
brother™s name, promine nt Wall Street lawyer, 
and his wife. They let us Œ their estate 
gave us for basic training. We  were trai
ned by Sternists hiding here in the United 
States. The Brits put the pr
ice 5,000 pounds in those days, for their heads, and we 
were trained. We smuggled arms, a mmunitions
. We learned assassination tactics. We 
learned all sorts of things on the estate. 
The FBI and together 
with Scotland Yard 
began to discover what we were doing. S
o, we had to empty out or ____ what we 
called stor age place of guns, ammunitions, in 
the Lower Eastside. We  dumped it all in 

the East River. Some  of my colleagues 
were caught. I was not caught dumping some  
of the stuff in East River. But, an interest
ing incident happened that affected me  very 
greatly. Our headquarters was on Sec
ond Avenue, around Eleventh Street, 149 
Second Avenue, and there was a ____ right n
earby, a little sort of a synagogue which 
a ___ where students could study 
the __, and I went there in 
order to say kaddish for 
my father, and I come  in and the Rabbi said, I said to the Rabbi, ﬁCan you please help 

me ?  I don™t know how to put on ____, how to 
put on all the rest. I want to say 
kaddish for my father.ﬂ ﬁ What happened to
 your father? ﬂ  ﬁHe was killed during the 
war.ﬂ He said, ﬁThey were right to kill 
your father for not having taught you the 
Jewish ways.ﬂ That turned me  off. I go 
now, Yom Kippur, once a ye
ar to say kaddish 
to a synagogue, but otherwise I don™t go. It
™s wrong ma ybe because of one stupid 
Rabbi having said this, but it affected me e motionally very, very much, this little 

incident. It wasn™t so 
much a little incident. 
 

Q:  It™s a big incident. 

 

A:  It was a very big incident, and it was ri
ght near our headquarters 
here in New York on 
Second Avenue I reme mber, but the reason I 
decided to quit Ster
n because after the 
State of Israel was created, established, Ster
n decided not to disb
and, continue as an 
underground move me nt. Arrogated to itself 
the right to kill fellow Jews, if they, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
92 
 
especially the leaders, if th
ey did not agree to the idea 
of the Shtei gadot l™jardein 
meaning two sides of the Jordan, but 
it™s the old tradition of Palestine. 
 
Q:  Greater  Palestine. 

 

A:  Greater Palestine, and that was can assa
ssinate those Jews, and after having suffered 
what I have suffered, et cet
era, kill a fellow Jew? As young as I was, I had enough 
brain, and as uneducated as I still was, I 
had enough brain to sa
y, ﬁThat doesn™t sit 
right.ﬂ Œ was reason number one. Number two, af
ter the state of Israel was declared to 
be a sovereign state, the ideological 
head, some body by the name  of ____ who 
entered parliame nt in Israel, too at the time,
 took us into a Marxist-Leninist mode that 
this is some thing that we should strive for, we
 mu st strive for. It 
is the ideal world. By 
having lived in a Marxist-Leninist Totalita
rian System, even if
 I didn™t understand it 
very much, and the hush-hush talks et cetera 
so that I shouldn™t 
understand, this also 
did not sit right. So, at a certain mo ment, 
I decided to quit because the moveme nt had 
become my life. 
 

Q:  It had? 

 

A:  It had where we used to clean our ar
ms and a mmunition in my apartment, in my 
room, and my mother happened to be home
 and suddenly knocked at the door, and 
said, ﬁGeorge, ma y I please see you?ﬂ A
nd, I came  out, and she said, ﬁWhat are you 
doing there?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, we™re just 
playing some  game s.ﬂ  ﬁAre you doing 
some thing with arms , revolvers or so? ﬂ  
I said, ﬁYes, mother.ﬂ She said, ﬁYou know, 

my suggestion is at least close the wi
ndow so the neighbors shouldn™t hear what 
you™re doing.ﬂ So, she knew suddenly what it wa
s all about, and I told my mother that 
when I™m going to be 21, I™ll go to Palestine to fight. She said, ﬁ When you™ll be 21, 

we™ll talk about it, 
but in the meantime you mus t  also 
get your education.ﬂ So, I was 
combining the two. Anyways, there was a 
court marshal of me in a basement on 
Fifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue 
in Borough Park baseme nt, where I was 
threat ened with my life if ever I were to 
give up the idea of the two sides of the 
Jordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were
 to appr oach anot her me mber of the Stern 
group that I knew, if ever I were to disclo
se anything that transpired here in the 
United States, and our cell structure, so 
on and so forth. I promised, of course, I 
wouldn™t do anything of the sort, and they sa
id, ﬁFine, these are our warnings.ﬂ And, 
this came  to me  as a terrible shock becau
se the moveme nt had become  my life, and 
my closest fr iends I could no longer see,
 spend time with, or even talk, and I 
reme mber traveling to Brooklyn every 
morning going to New Utrecht from 
Manhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to ti me I would see some on the 

subway, my buddies, they looked 
away as if I was a traito
r. The way the girl looked 
away when I had the st ar, and that affect
ed me  enormously because the moveme nt 
was part of my life. This withdrawal, 
for six mo nths I had difficulty sleeping I 
reme mber, and then it went on. In the m
eanti me , I entered college which I wasn™t 
very much interested, but the Stern group sa
id that we had to go to City College, 
why? In those days, City College wa s excellent , because you had a special pr ofessor 

there, Hans Cohen, the father of the st
udy of nationalism, et cetera, and he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0493  
93 
 
teaching there, and some  other cour ses, but 
especially nationalism, what it™s all about 
Œ implications, et cetera, et cetera. So, I t
ook the exam and I ma naged to get in. It was 

an eight hour entrance exam in those days, 
very tough, but I ma naged to get in, and I 
worked at the same time to help out. I 
didn™t want Œ I knew that my mother was 

struggling even though she never said a word, 
et cetera. So, I wanted to make some  
money on the side. So, I worked
 in the library. I worked 
as a runner for a friend of 
mi ne, here in the jewelry district who ope
ned a business. So, I ma naged some  way or 

other always to earn between ten and twen
ty dollars a week on top of studying et 
cetera. So, but I did not have to depend on 
my mother™s me ager income . Then, I Œ at 
the beginning, it didn™t inte
rest me  very much, the studies, but suddenly, some thing 
clicke d and I began to read voraciously b
ecause  my mother kept on sayi ng always, 

ﬁYou know, a ma n for me, is not a man without
 an education.ﬂ And would say to me , 
ﬁHow can one really live a life without 
reading a good book.ﬂ The li
terature Pushkin, 
Lermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, 
et cetera. This is part of life.ﬂ Because 
they used to discuss it at di
nner tables as a child. It didn
™t interest me. Characters, 
who cared?  The character™s 
in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly, 
some thing snapped, and I couldn™t stop readi
ng, and I began to read a lot, day and 
night, and what interested me  particularly
 was a history of Wo rld Wa r II, and one 
thing led to the other, led also to literatu
re, led to philosophy, led 
to even an interest 
in the sciences. For a while, I thought of
 studying medicine. I met a young woman 
who was going to study me dicine. Her father
 was a doctor. She was interested in 
me dicine. So, I figured I would also take  some  courses, and I took courses along 

those lines, but I reacted ve
ry poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes 

and we had to dissect pigs and rats, and 
from all the for maldehyde, I began to get 
rashes here on the side. So, I really had troub
le, not that me dicine interested me , but I 
decided to have some thing in common with
 the woman that I thought I fancied. But, 
so much the better that I didn™t. 
 

Q:  So, you got yourself a PhD in Political Theory, yes. 

 

A:  We ll, fi rst, ye s, Political  Theory because 
I majored originally in histor y, then Political  
Science, and then PhD, actually PhD in Po
litical Science because I had ma jored in 
History and I always felt when I became  al
ready sort of semi -educated that you can™t 
be a good Political Scientist without a t
horough knowledge of Hist
ory especially the 
Western Tradition from Antiquity to th
e Present, and you could not be a good 
historian, without an understandi ng of politic
al relations between and among states, 
and international relation
s, so on and so forth. 
 

Q:  So, this mus t  have ma de your mother really happy. 

 

A:  She unfortunately didn™t live to see that  
I got because my first PhD was rejected as a 
dissertation, which subsequently was publis
hed and is now cite
d all over the world, 
and opened up an entirely new field of st
udy in the English speaking world. So, I had 
to write a second dissertation, 
and that hurts me  very, very much that my mother did 
not see the success subsequently. The s
econd PhD got me  into foreign policy.

Q:  I see, and then in the ‚70s, you founde
d the National Committ ee on American Foreign 
Policy. 
 
A:  American Foreign Policy with the late 
Hans Morgenthau. So, and which I have been 
now President for the last twelve or thirteen
 years, but I was one of the founders, yes. 
 

Q:  And, you married in ™64.  

 

A:  Sixty-four yes, a Latvian 
Jewish girl who lived in Swed
en during the war. Her ma iden 
name  was ____, a prominent Jew in Sweden, 
head of the We ll Jewish Congress in 

Sweden, who opened negations _____ with Himler
, and as a result was able to rescue 
Jews from ____ Concentration Camp  
_____. You know the story, and then ma de 
some  deals with Himl er over not blow
ing up camps in the west, especially 

____________ which was successful negotiations. 
So, he ma de a contribution to 
history, especially Jewish hi
story, no question about it. 
 

Q:  And, the two of you have three boys, right? 

 

A:  Triplets, triplet sons. We  had a fourth one
 that unfortunately didn™t ma ke it. So, yes, 
and they™re all thank God, healthy and successf
ul . So, I really can™t complain. I count 
my blessings. 
 

Q:  Well, I wish we could go on, but it would take
 us another five or 
six hours. So, I think 
we have to do that at another time, and I 
really want to thank 
you so much for being 
willing and able to speak with us
. It™s really been a pleasur e. 
 
A:  My pleasure and my privilege to have done this. 
 

Q:  A privilege for me . Thank you very much. 

 

A:  Thank you. Thank you very much.

 years after I was born. 
 

Q:  And, who™s this?   

 

A: This was a pi ctur e. I™m i n front in the white suite accompanying, well, sayi ng 
farewell to my cousin who holds me , 
Mania. She was on her way to London to 
embark I think it was either the Queen Ma
ry or the Queen Elizabeth, the maiden

othes in stores. I had 
my seamstress twice a year who would come
 to the house and do my winter and my 
summer wardrobe, and this same  wa s the 
case - my mother had her own seamstress 
who would come  twice a year for a couple

A:  Oh sorry. 

 

Q:  Oh, it™s all right?  Go ahead. 

 

A:  This is me , not long after the liberation. 
I think this is the first photograph taken. It 
must have been two mo nths or so after liber
ation, where I™m still as 
I look at it pretty 
emaciated and that of course is during 
World Wa r II, during th
e tough days of World 
War II, but also with a certain sadness in
 my eyes, I see, really not knowing the 
direction I want to go, I guess. 
 

Q:  Okay. 

 

A:  This was me  in Hamburg, _____ on or

A:  These are friends of mi ne, and I™m in

house on the Wa rburg Estate. These were peopl
e, also, kids in the children™s home on 
the estate. 
 

Q:  Okay, this picture. 

 

A:  That™s me  in front of the car that I us
ed to have in Ha mburg. I don™t see my driver 
there or his brother, and I paid
 in cigarettes or  coffee, and I was driven to wherever I 
wanted to be driven in the Ha mburg area. 
I didn™t ask them t o drive me  let™s say to 
Paris or so, but in Hamb
urg, I rode in style. 
 

Q:  And, who™s this? 

 

A:  To the left to the gentlema n in his hat, is my driver. The one who is behind the wheel 
is a friend of mi ne, and I stand in front of 
the car, and the car is in front of the white 
house that was the ma in house of the Wa rbur
g Estate, and that™s where I used to 
reside, in the white house for 
a while. I never resided in th
e red house, but for a while

then Tunia Rybak, and Rachelka Feigenbaum, 
next to Renia, to 
the right of Renia. 
These were the three ladies who used to
 go nightclubbing in Be rlin, et cetera, who 
sort of dismissed me  outright when I wa
nted to tag along thinking that I wa s too 
young, perhaps not all that sophisticated at 
the time  or whatever, but that was the 
ﬁnormal lifeﬂ at the time. 
 

Q:   

 

A:  This was in Berlin 1947, Summer ™46. 

 

Q:  When was this exactly? 

 

A:  This was in the summer, late summe r  of 1946 in Berlin. 

 

Q:  That™s a correction. 
 
A:  Correction, yes.
