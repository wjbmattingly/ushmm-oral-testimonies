T heresienstadt.
 
 
Later in 1944

B o b B eh r .
 
[A

>> Bob Behr: T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Seated right here, Bob. Bob, thank you so muchfor joining us and being 

wi lling to be our
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
today.  Youhave som uch that we could spendthe rest of today 
andtom orrow with you but we have one 
hour
 
so we'll jum p right in and get started.  .
 
 
You spent your childhood years in Berlin before the war began, Bob.  Tell us about 
your lif e, yourfam ily's life, your com munity inthe years bef ore Kristallnachtandbefore thewar 

began.
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, very brief ly, m y f ather was a doctor,m edical doctor, m y mother was a 

housewif e,
 
andI am an only child because
 
Iwas told that when I was born,m y m other took 
one look atm eand says, "
O
h, boy, enough is enough" and never had any siblings.  So I grew 
up
.  
 
Now, you need to sortof takem entally
 
--
 
go back tothe 1920s.  Looking at you guys 
f rom here,I don'tthink thereare very m any people who were born and raised in the1920s.  

T he reasonI mention it, because I was.  And it's there that Imademy f irst
 
ver y f aint and 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
5
 
nebulousacquaintance with Nazi Germ any.
 
 
T he Nazis in the 1920s were excellent in analyzing the m entality of  the German 
people;m eaning the Nazis ga ve the Germ anpeoplem usic, gave them f lags, the uniform ,gave 
them  a greeting, everything which the Germ an people sort of loved.
 
 
In addition to that, they also instilled absolutely dedicated hatredofanything Jewish.
 
Now, there arehundreds of  stories going around why Hitler hated the Jews.  I'm  going to skip 
th a t.  I'll ju stte ll yo u  tha t he
 
was deeply concernedthat the Jews were an evil people andthat 
they needed tobeeliminatedf rom  the Germ an life.
 
 
Now, let m e give you two m inutesof m y fam ily.  Ladiesand gentlemen, we were born 
Jewish.  My f ather was Jewish.  My m other was Jewish.  And Iam Jewish.  But, in ourhearts, 

in our attitude,I was raised asa Germ an.  My parents, believe it or not, weref irst Germ ans, 
second they were Germ ans, third they were Germ ans,and only then were they Jewish.  So 
you can clearly see the priorities.  W ebelieved in Germ any.  My father volunteered inW orld 
W ar I, we n t 
tothef ront, became an off icer
 
and got decorated with the iron cross; really 
believed that he was doing the right thing to risk his lifefor Germany.  That was the very m an 

who was condemned by Adolph Hitler and the Nazi regim e as beingan evil person.
 
 
Now, I som etim es talkto 8th graders. And Ialwa ys m ake them stand up and say 
anybody who's got brown eyes, I want you tostand up
, t
o the kids.T hey stand up.  I says, 
ﬁD
on't sit down.  Just rem ain standing. Andwhen I got them in theroom , I tell them  that you 
with the brown eyes are evil.  So they look ateachother
,
ﬂ w
ondering what's com ing next. And 
I tell them, there isno explanation, you are bad people because you got brown eyes.
  
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

T hat's ina nutshell an ideaof  whata dictatorship is.  So you need toaccept that. I 
don't know if  we're going to get into thehistory, but I wanted to tell you that was thef irst 
inclination.
 
 
My personal experience, rem em bering thistoday, 90
-
s om e
 
years later, was 
comm unication.  Anybody know what them ass comm unication was in the 1920s?  
Newspapers and whatelse?  Come on, guys.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heysaid it, radio.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Radio is absolutely correct. T he radio was playing.  My dad was lis
te n in g to  it.  
He was ver y politicall y m inded. And out of this radio cam e the voice.  No idea who. It was so 

full of hatred. A kid could understand that this guy was angr y, ver y m ad.
  
I heard him  say 
things which, of  course, I didn't understand. Talked
 
about the Jewish conspiracy.  He talked 
about the Jews have cost the lossof W orldW ar I
; t
he Jews signed thepeace treaty whic h was 
detrimental to Germany.
 
 
So what do you do when you're 6, 7 years old and you hear that? You feela threat 
and you don't 
know what to do with it. W ell, you do theonly thing.  You go to your motherand 
you says:  M
om
,  
what in the world is a Jewish conspiracy?  Andm y m om ,bless her heart, 
s a id
,  
ﬁD
on't worr y about it.
ﬂ
  
Yeah, but I like to know what it is.
ﬂ
  
T akes me too long to explain 
it
ﬂ.   Y
ou don't worry about it.  Nobody wil l hurt you.  Nobody wi ll do anything.  Nobody will h arm  
you.
ﬂ
  
T hefamous words were all changed on the 30thof  January, 1933.  Adolph Hitler 
becam ethe chancellor of Germ any and suddenly had all the power to do what he has been 
threatening all of thistim ebefore.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

So that was m y awakening to the Nazi tyranny.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob, tell us, after Hitler cam e to com pletepower in1933, several years later 
you would go to school in Sweden. T ell us why.
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, I went to a boarding school in Sweden.  Now, here comes the geography.  

Sweden is aneutral country.  Sweden is af riendly country.  The idea was what m y parents 
wanted
 
me to get outof Germany.
 
 
In order tounderstand it, you've got to be cognizant of  what it was like in Germ any 
af ter Hitler cam e topower.  You want to be harm ed?  Yes.T hey were beating up Jews on the 
streets. They were m aking our life m iserable.
 
 
T ake your hom etown. T hink about it. W hen you suddenly see in stores,
 
in  
restaurants, in places big signs that you arenotallowed to come inthere because you got 
brown eyes or blueeyes, in our case because we were Jewish.
 
 
Berlin changed com pletely.  Berlin was never a very beautif ul city like some places 
we re .  B u t it w
as afunctional city.  And all of  this changed oneday. Letm edescribe to you, if I 
m ay, the day Hitler took power.
 
 
W hen we have elections up here, there's a lot of  tension inthe air until the ballots 
were counted. T hen you have a speech by the loser and a speechby the winner.  Nobody 

gets hurt.
 
 
Now let m e turn this around to Germ any in 1933.  Hitler was electedchancellor.  
Now, we don'thave tim e heretooutline what a chancellor is.  Letm eput it in a nutshell. A 
chancellor hasunder the Parliamentary system  in Germany aboutas m uch power as a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
president of the United States. So Hitler was now them ostpowerful person who candopretty 
m uch what he wanted, and there we were.
 
 
So on thatday I want to describe to you theNazis m arched through the 
c it y of  B e rlin  
towards the residence where Hitler was living to give him  a standing ovation. T hey hadm ade 
it a torch march. They had the torchmarch. And they were singing.
 
 
Germ ans love to sing.  Now, that's no problem
 u
nless you know wh at they were 
s
inging.  Letm e sharewith you the opening line of oneof  the songs they were singing.  In 
translation it says
,  "W
hen Jewish blood spurts from our knives, thenour lives will be so much 
better."   Now, you're 7, 8 years oldand you hear that.W hatdoes that tell you? T hat those 

guys are bound to hurt you becauseotherwis e Jewish blood wouldn't spurt f rom your knives.
 
So I lived a lifef ullof unhappiness,f ullof  worry.  T he lif e was conf ined.  W ecouldn'tdo 

anything.  I was kicked out of  school.  Ididn'thave any education until I came to Am ericaand 
tooka G.E.D. test.  My m other hom eschooled m e a littlebit so I could read and write, buta 
regular education wasn't even allowed. I couldn't go to school.
 
 
I want to just give you one m ore example of the lif e, why I wound up in Sweden.  I 
told you thatm y fatherwas a soldier.  Itold you thatm y f am ily was f irst German, second 
Germ an, and so forth. W e were proud to be Germ ans. W hat happened in September of  
1934? They had abig m eeting in the city of  Nuremberg where they issueda new law that no 
Jew could bea Germ an citizen, whether youwere born there or notm ade no difference.  From  
now on you areonly aresidentbut you arenot a citizen. T ranslate what that means in 
essence, you lose all of  your civil rights.  You couldn't vote.  You couldn't do anything.  You 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
couldn't participate in any off icial lif e.  You were an outcast.
 
 
In answer to your question
 
--
 
and I'm  sorry I'm so long winded,but my m other wanted 
the best for m e.  And the best for me was
 
toget outof  Germany, go to som e country wher e 
you were respected, where you liked, whereyou could live withoutbeing constantly af raid.  
T here was a Jewish f inancier in Sweden who opened up a boarding school and m y m other 
was successful to enroll m e.  From one day to another I was outof  Germ any, I was f ree.  I 
couldbem yself . W ithout having to lookover m y shoulder who was going to kick m e in the 
behind
 w
hen Idon't see it. So that's why I we nt to Sweden.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkthere isa groupof
 
about 30 Jews f rom Berlin or Germany that were 
there. At some point you hadto come back. T ell us why
 
--
 
and there's only a couple of  you 
that came back. Tell us about that.
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, very sim ple.  Any schoolneeds to have tuition. And it wa
s  the  s ame as  a  
private school.W henm y m other went to thebank in Berlinand wanted to change X num ber of  
Germ anm arks into Sweden, the clerk toldher
,  "W
edon't do that anym ore. T his is currency 
we needfor other purposes and you can'thave any money to send to Swedenfor your son's 

school."
 
 
So what was theupshot? The school closed.  But we were told that the 
d
i re c t o r of  
the school, when he announced that the school would be closing, said that they hadf ound 
fam ilies in Sweden who were wi lling to take us in so that we wouldn't have to go back to 
Germ any.  Jubilation?  Of course.  For me? No.  Because the director said: You know, all we 
needf rom  you is the signature of your parents that they do not object if you stay in Sweden

instead of returning t
o Germ any.
 
 
W ell,m y m other wouldn't sign that. She want
ed m e 
to come home. I'm f rom  a pretty 
dysf unctionalfam ily, but here is thef irstevidence.  She wanted mehome. So when the other 
kids stayed inSweden, I had to com eback.  Icam e back. W eare now talking aboutmaybe 
early 1938, January, February, and I was right back in Germ any whe re thepersecution of the 
Jews was worse thansix m onthsago when Ileft.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, laterthat year, Bob, November
 9 -
10, 1938, Kristallnacht, or
 
Night of Broken Glass, tell usabout that night and what it meantforyou and yourfam ily.
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, let m e first say, if Im ay,what is Kristallnacht. Kristallnacht isa very odd 

namefor som ething. W ell, let me tell you what that is.
 
 
In Paris, France, a Jewish kid killed a Germ an off icialf rom  theGerman 
E
m ba ssy.   I t 's 
a long story wh y he did that, but trust me he got apistol,he wentto the German 
E
m bassy and 
couldn't get aholdof  the 
a
m bassador but of the first secretary and, 
wham
, sho o ts
 
h im
 a
nd  on  
the night f rom  8 to 9 Novem ber
 
1938. And the Germ ans used thisassassination asanact 
which was probably unique in the world by burning the synagoguesof  the Jews, taking the 

H
o l y 
S c ri p t u re
 
and throwin g them  on the f loor and m aking the German
s walk about it. They 
sm a she d  
--
 
andthis iswhere the word com es f rom . T hey sm ashedall the windows of  the 
G e r m an
-
owned stores.  The glass was littering on thef loor.  And that's where the word 
Kristallnacht com esf rom .  It was a nightof  terror.
 
 
Did  a
nything happen to me?  No.  Becausem y m other som ehow got tipped off by 
som ef riend who says don't let your son get out of the house on the9thof  November; youkeep 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

11
 
him  hom e. Because, ladies and gentlem en, the Nazis also arrested30,000 Jews, eeny, 
m eeny
, m iny, moe withoutany reason and put them  into concentration cam ps.T he only wa y 
outof  those cam ps was on a ship toanothercountry.  And that'sanother story because itwas 

ver y diff icult to getother countries to agree.
 
 
My f ather, m y biological f ather, was arrestedthatnight.  I never saw him  again.  He 
was put in a concentration cam pf orno otherreasonthat he was Jewish.  But that's not what 
they toldhim . For no other reason, aspunishm entf orthe assassination of that German 
E
m bassy guy in Par
is .
 
 
So here we were. W hat happensnow?  Now our synagogues aredestroyed.  In 
addition, which is not well
-
known, the Germ ans alsom adetwo rulings.  Letm etell you. They 
told the insurance companies which insured the synagogues and the stores, that the
y m u st 

pay the indem nity.  W hatever the store is insuredf or,the insurance com pany must pay.  But 
then com es thehooker.  You don'tpay them  to the owner.  No. T heowner gets nothing.  But 
the state collectsthe insurancem oney.
  
So the guys did not only
 
lose their stores but they also 
lost whatever it was they would have gottenfrom  the insurance company.
 
 
But this didn't affect us.  We didn't have a store.  It didn't affect us. W hat did affect 
us, what Ihaven't told you yet, the second thing they did,
 
they levied af ine on the Jewish 
population.  AndI'm not having a speechdefect when I tell you it was one billionm arks. That's 
not 
a  
def ect on m y m ind.  It was a billionm arks.  Every Je w got a quotahow m uch he had to 
pay the governm ent.  W e got a qu
ota which we couldn'tm eet. W edidn'thave thatm uch 

m oney.  My m otherhad to sell som e jewelry i n ordertom eet our quota.

You see,the power of the Germans was such that there was noobjections.  Wehad 
no rights.  You couldn't go to court. It was impossiblebecause we had no civil ri ghts. W ewere 
notprotectedby that.  So it was a terrible thing f or us to live because life becam eeven worse 
af ter that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,Bob, of  course, thef ollowing September Germ any invaded Polandand 

W or ld  W ar
 
II off icially began in September
 
1939.  You and your mother and your stepf ather 
would rem ain living in Berlin until you were arrested in 1942. T ell us brief ly
 
--
 
I kn o w it's a  lo t of 
tim e,but in those years before you were arrested,but the war was on, what was life likefor 
you?  I know you were forced to doforced labor during that tim e.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah. The Germans initiated som ethingf or Jews which I call forced labor.And 

I don't want you to think it's slave labor. W estill li ved at hom e.W e could go back and forth
 t
o 
work.  So we were directed to go to work.
  
They createdanoff ice where you hadto reportin 
them orning.  And then they said,ok, there, you go, carry coal
 o
r you carry bricks.  It was all 
m anual labor
; d
iff icult but not im possi
ble.
 
 
In addition, since the war had started the whole country was on rations.  Everybody 
hada ration card. W edid, too.T hehooker with that ration card was it was worth 50% of  what 

the Christian comm unity got.
 
 
Now what doesthatmean?  If you areentitled tohalf a pound of butter a week, which 
isn't very m uch in the first place, we were only allowed a quarterof  apound. W hatever the 
Germ ans got, we got 50% if  it was available because, you see, chicanery, we were not allowed 
to go shopping at 9:00
i
n the morning.  Jews could only go at 4:00
 
in the af ternoon where most 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

ever ything was sold out.  It was a war going o n.  So what was lef t over was able to sell to 
Je ws.
  
Sof or thef irsttim e in m y life I was hungr y.  I just didn't have enough to eat. T he
re was 
a blackm arket going on.  Butfor us it was very diff icult
, s
o it was a life which is alm ost diff icult 
to understand.
 
 
Now, when you hear this story
,  
what do 
you 
think kept us going?  I'll gi ve it to you in 
this one word. T hat word is spelled h
-o -p -
e. As long as you canhope thatthings will change, 
thatthings will get better, you've got som ething to hang onto.  But the hope got dim mer and 

dimm er because everything
 
--
 
let me just give you anexam ple.  Billalluded to it.  On 3 
September 1939, the
 
SecondW orldW ar broke. T he Germ ansm arched intoPoland. And the 
next day Britain and Francedeclared war onGerm any.
 
 
Now, let m edescribeto you that day.  It was a Sunday.  Allof  a sudden it was 
announced that theW orldW ar II had broken out because
 
Germany was, as the Nazis put it, 
was attacked by Britain and by France.
 
 
My parents on that day
 
--
 
I'll never f orget that.  They were jubilant. They were 
absolutely besidesthem selves in saying this is theend of the Germ an Nazi regim e because 

the Frenchand the British are going todefeatGerm an Arm y in six m onths and we wil l be f ree.
 
 
Now, looking at you, most of you if  not allof  you,are notW orldW arII veterans. So 
let me justtell you what really happened. The m ore m y parents were jubilant, the 
le s s  rea lity 
set inbecausetheGerm ans were winning.  They were winning ever ything.  The Germ an Arm y 
conquered Parisfourweeks after the war started.T hey never gotto Paris inW orldW ar I in 
four years.  Now Hitler was in Paris andthe swastika was f lying.  T he happiness of m y parents

went sm aller and sm aller and smaller.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,Bob, of  course, you would continue underthose circumstances until July 
of  19 4 2.
 
>> Bob Behr: T hat's right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were arrested. Tell us about the arrestof  youand your parents.
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, we were arrested by theGestapo. Thearrest was not because we wer e 

Jewish.  T hat's thefunny part. T hat hadnothing to do with it, perhaps indirectly butnot 
d ire c t ly.
 
 
I don't want to bore you with a personal story.
 
>> Bill Benson:  No,no.  This is an importantstory.
 
>> Bob Behr:  All right.  Then I will tell you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Bob Behr:  My m other had a girlf riend, a lady she went to school with.  Don't letthat word 

girl f ool you.  My m other was a gro wn
-
up person, so was that lady. I thinkthey went to school 
together. I'm not really sure. And that lady cam etom y m other and said to her," Lily
 
--
 
wh ic h  is  
m y m other'sf irst name, " Lily, I needto getout of  Germ any.  I have nof amily. 
 
I have no 
relatives.  I have nobody.  I'm  all
 
alone.  I need to get out. Can you help m e or have you got 
any ideas?"
 
 
W ell, the second part ofthe story is, yes, m y m other did.  Shehadm et a Catholic 
priest who lived and worked inthe city of Constance.
  
W hen you goback, look at an atlas and 
f ind the city of  Constance. T hat is in spitting distancef rom Switzer land.  You can practically

takea stoneand throw it and it winds up in Swit zerland which, as you know, was a f riendly, 
neutral, f ree country.
 
 S
o, I'm  going tomake that short. My m othergave that lady the address and the 
name andaddress of the priest.  She wentdown to Constance. She m et the guy.  She 
persuaded him one way or the other to take that lady across the border during the night 
becau
se it was punishable. You were notallowed to go to Switzerl and.  But she better cross.
 
So, happy story.  
 

 
Letm etell you the rest of  itand then you will see what Bill meant by that the wom an 
is f ree. It's Switzerland.  It's July.  The weather is beautif ul.  So shegoes toa cafe, sitsdown, 

and writes a postcard.  That isthef irst m istake.  Youdon't write a postcard to a country whi ch 
has censorship
, b
ut she did.  And she writes that she is in Switzer land, the capital,blah, blah, 
blah,and then she
 
write s a  P.S . 
o
n the postcard
, w
h ich  sa ys,  "
W
ithout you I would never be 
here. Thank you somuch."
 
 
Now, you are now a Gestapo officer.  You are assigned censorshipof m ail.  You look 
at thatpostcard and there's a Swiss stam p on it. So you know thatthatpostcard was m ailed in 
Swit zerland.  You put two and two together
 a
nd bingo.  You know that the recipientof  that 
postcard is the one who helpedthat wom an to escape, which was punishable
, s
everely 
punishable.
  
So the Gestapof ound us a day later or two
 
days later, arrested all of  us
f
o r 
helping aperson to escape from Germ any inthem iddle of the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And when you were arrested, I believe you were beaten and thrown into acell.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah. They beat me up. They toldm e

T hey told m e 
f o r 
m e  to  
report thenext morning at 9:00
 
to the local police precinct.
 
 
So, ladies and gentlemen, whatare you going to do now?  I hada choice.  I could go 
into hiding.  I could kill m yself . I coulddo very little else.  Going into hiding in a wartim e 
situation when everything was controlled, where all thef ood were rationed, where do you go?  
T he punishm entfor hiding a Jew f rom  the authorities was concentration cam p if not worse.  
W hodo you go toandsay:  I want you tohide m e until the war is over?  I didn't have anybody.
 
 
So Bill is right.  I reported to the precinct. They beat me up. Arrested me, too.  Put 
m eaway.  And then we were shipped off to a concentration cam p.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I know our tim e is starting toget close
 
--
 
runoutof  it. T ell usabout where they 
sent youand what it was likef or you inT heresienstadt.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Ok. T he Nazis had two majorcategories of cam ps.One isa killing cam p where 

they gassed people.  And one isa working cam p.  Many of thepeople, six m illion people, as 
you have heard, went to the killing cam ps. T hey arri ved.  They put them  in a gas cham ber.  
Endof  story.  But thenthere was a category of  Jews that were not sent to the killing cam ps. I 
don't have really too much 
tim e to tell you why not, but
 
bottom  line is, tom ake it very short, the 
reason we were not sent to a gas cham ber isbecausem y father was a veteranof W orldW ar I.  

Don't askme where the Nazis got thathonorcodethat they suddenly honored
 
r ef u ge e
 
--
 
I 
m ean Jews who were veterans of the war
 b
ut they did. So we did not wind up in a killingf ield.  
W e wound up inT heresienstadt
,  
which is anold Hungarian town which was em ptiedand used 
them  asa concentration cam p. It was aterrible stay.

>> Bob Behr: W ell, I want to tell you, the tone of T heresienstadt when it was still a civilian 
town hadabout4,000people. 4,000people. In the space of 4,000people the Nazis, inc
l ud i n g 
us, moved 60,000people.  60,000 people ina space of 4,000 people.
 
 
I'm  going toask you aquestion. How m any of  you like som etim esprivac y when you
 
can 
c
lose the door, want to be alonefor an hour or two? Letm e see your hands.
 
 
W ell, thank you.
  
T hat's what we thought.  Everybody likes pri vacy.  T his was 
im possible.  It was so crowded there were peopleeverywhere, day andnight.  At night we 

couldn't go out. W e were locked in thebuilding.  In thebuilding,m y m other, m y stepfather and 
m ys e l f ,  
was a four
-
bedroom  house.  Not four bedroom s
, f
ou r
-
room  house
o
ut of  which 
ever ything was gone.  There wasn't a stitchof furniture. T here wasn't a nail on the wall.  There 

was no straw on thef loor.  We had to sleepon the cem entf loor.  Ofcourse everyb
ody had to 
go to work.  I was im mediately collected to work.  And if  I tell you what m y f irst work was, you 
wi ll shutter.
 
 
My f irst work was to collect dead bodies.  People were dying like f lies. T hey had to 
be collected, manually, and brought outsidethe
 
town where another crew was buryin g them in 
gra ves.  Sothat was my acquaintance with death.
 
 
I venture thatmost of you when you were conf ronted with death was a solemn 
o cca sio n e
ither a viewi ng or a wake, but nothing where you take bodies and throw them
 
on a 
cart tobring them  out of town.
 
 
You know what thatdoes to you?  It makes you pretty raw.  It m akes you pretty raw.  
You don't even care anym ore.  All you care is how heavy is the body and how high do you

have to throw it?  Canyou imagine that?  I was 20 years old. It was not something I enjoyed.  
So that's what work wa s like.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Eventually, through the helpI thinkof  someone you knew you were able to get 

outof  that joband wor k in a kitchen.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yeah.  Iwas lucky.  I m et
 
a Czech guy who took a liking to me. He was older 
than I am .  He gotm e in the kitchen. But it didn't last very long.  
 
 
W ell, you wantm e to go into
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Not yet.  I want you to takeam om ent andtell usa very poignant story.  Of  

co u rse
,by work ing in the kitchen, if  you were clever, you could get a little extrafood.  You 
could take some butter.  And yourf ather, your stepfather, who was the M.D., gave you a 

lecture about taking extra butter. W ill you share that with us?
 
>> Bob Behr:  
Re lu ct an t ly.   B u t  I will.
 
 
Hunger was prevailing.   Hunger, exceptfor people likem e who were working in the 
kitchen, hunger was everywhere.  People were dying of hunger.  Ihad am otherand a 

stepfather who were hungry. W hatdo youdo if  you have food andthey have none?
  
I tell you 
what I did. I stole. I stole things which I could put inm y
 
--
 
in thepocket of m y pants and gave 
it tom y parents. T hat was the way I could extend their lif e.
 
 
T he problem  is you couldn'tdo this openly.  Irem em ber taking
 
som e m argarine 
without paper.  Margarine was in abarrel.  I took som em argarine. How am I going to get this 
tom y parents?  Iput itin m y pocket. The result, you can imagine. Ever ything was greasy, but 
they loved it. T hey had som ething toputontheir piece of bread and it madenodiff erence.

W hen m y s t e pfat he r

I keep saying father, stepf ather. My m other got divorced
 
--
 
I 
m e an
 
--
 
yeah. She got divorced.  My biologicalf ather got arrested. I told youthis.  He was in 
a concentration camp.  My m other rem arried and what I talkabout now is m y stepfather.
 
And whenI cam eoneday prouder than a peacock,m argarine in my pocket, and says, "
L
ook 
what I brought you."   He took it, she took it, they used it,and
 
then he called m e up saying, 
"C
ome here
.  
I  
want totalk to you."  andthen he gave m ea lecture. Now, you bethe judge.  
He  
was telling m e inno uncertainterm s thatwhat I was doing was stealing, stealing is wr ong; 
you don't steal.  He told me thatI shouldnotdo this because I have to live with
 
m yself , being a 
t h i ef .
  
I looked at it that it saved def initely m y m other's lif e. Because I didn't always take just 
m argarine. There was flour and things like that.
 
 
It was a very dif f icult timefor me to hearm y stepfather lecturing me not to steal 
kn o
wing that it savedm y m other's lif e.W hat would you have done?  Don't answer that. But 
it's noteasy.  If I had tim e, I could tell you m ore stories like this.
  
You get into conf lict with your 
m oral consciousnessbecause I kepttaking stuff . I ignoredm y
 
stepfather. If igured it's more 
im portant
 
--
 
and he ate it, too.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
So If igured it couldn't be all that bad
 b
ecause if  he is so intent on being honest and 
upright, thenhe wouldn't have touched it.  But hedid. Soend of story.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n
:  Bob, you would eventually be sentto work
 
--
 
we had m entioned in the 
introduction you were sent to help rebuild the destroyedSS headquarters.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Yes.

>> Bill Benson: T hatwas a horrif ic experiencef or you evenaf ter you hadbeen through all
 
you 
had been through.
 
>> Bob Behr:  Bill, that was the worst tim eI have had. T his was a tim e when we were sent
 
--
 
there were 200 people.  How did I get there? W ell, Bill already said the SS headquarters was 
destroyed andthe guy wanted to have anew headquarters.  He picked a place
 a
nd says build 
m ea new headquarters.  T hey cam e toT heresienstadtand askedfor 250 volunteers to go 

thereand build that headquarters.
 
 
W ell, inorder tom ake that interesting for people like us, the prisoners
 
--
 
why would 
we want to volunteer to go there? W ell, youneed to know that by that time
 
--
 
when I toldyou 
that we had60,000people cramm ed into a spacefor 4,000, the Nazis had beganto realize 

thatthey had to do som ething because they were going to have diseases. 
 
T hey have to do all 
sorts of problem s.They got to empty that cam pout.  For the Nazis, there was aone
-
wa y  
street
, t
he street ending with the word death. That is whenthey startedhaving transportf rom  
our cam pby train once or twice a week, a thousand
 
people in cattlecars to Auschwitz and into 
the gas cham bers.T hat em ptied the camp.
 
 
W eall knew that. W eall knew what happened.  Idon't have tim e totell you how we 
knew, but we knew. W e knew that those whowere what the Nazis called would be "rese
ttle d ," 
were actually killed.
 
 
So back to the headquarters. T he Nazis asked
 
--
 
needed 250people tobuild that 
headquarters. And then in order to make that m ore appealing they said if you volunteer togo, 
we wil l not, quote, resettle, unquote, yourf olks.  And I volunteered. Because If iguredm y 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

21
 
parents are liable to be arrested, put ina cattle car, sentand soforth.
 
 
So I volunteered. And this is what Bill was referring to.  It was a little villa ge where 
we started to build that headquarters. That, ladiesand gentlem en,af ter allof  these years I 
went through,f rom 1933 to 1943, 10 years, af ter all of this was through, the treatment in that 
place was so badthatfor the very f irst tim e
 
--
 
forgi ve m efor being honest with you
 
--
 
I wanted 
to  d ie.  Ih a
d lostthe guts to want to live.  Ihad enough.
 
Rem em ber, we were cut offfrom  any news.  W ehad no idea what the war was doing, 
who was winning, who was losing, nothing.  All we knew is that life became very m iserable.
 
T he SS guy treated usso badly so rough thatit wasn't really worth living anymore. And I gave 
up.  
 
 
W hat made it worse, Igot very sick.  I got a disease which is known as a vitamin 
def iciency. W e had no f resh vegetables.  We had nothing.
  
It is ugly.   You get big blotches 
over your body.  Your clothes stick.  Youhave ahigh tem perature. You feel
 
--
 
in order not to 
use a bad word, youf eel lousy.  I was weak. I just reached the end. AndI was still young.  I 
was only 25 years old.  ButI had no guts left.
 
 
Butfate wasn't quite happy f orm e to give up.  And f ate guidedm eone Sunday 
af ternoon on abarbedwire f ence where we were looking outof  the cam p.  Another prisoner 
andI were standing there.  Wedidn't have to work that Sunday. W e looked out.  And what we 
saw out there was a most am azing sight. W e saw a trek of Germans going
 
--
 
and this is 
im portantfor you to understand. They were going f rom east to west.  Since 1941 theGermans 

were going f rom  west to east
 c
onquering Russia.  Now the tide hadturned. W e see the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
Germ ans going
 
we s t .
 
 
I asked this guy next to m e saying, " Do you see this?"  " Of course Isee that."  "W
h a t 
is it? W hoare these men?" "T
hat,"  he said, "are Germ ans f leeing f rom  the Russians."   The 
Russians after the Stalingrad, the Germ ans have lost all the territory
 
they had conqueredand 
they are now reaching Germ any proper. Andthe Germansaref leeing f rom  the thing.
 
And I thoughtby m yself:  If the Russians are that close, then maybeI shouldn't give up. 
Maybe I should pull m yself together, hang in there,and maybe survive this mess
u
ntil the 
Russians are com ing.
 
 
T o makea long story short, in closing, the answer is, yes, and yes. I survived. W e 
returned to Theresienstadt in February of 1945.  Andon the5th of  May, the Russians cam e 

andour cam p was liberated
.  T hat's the sto ry.
 
>> Bill Benson: When you got back toT heresienstadt, what condition were your m om and 
your stepf ather in?
 
>> Bob Behr: W eak but living.  T hey were alive.  T hey were not evacuated. Like theGermans 
said, " resettled."  T hey were there. I could see them . T hey were ver y weak.  They died shortly 
af ter war f rom exhaustion. Butf or oncethe Nazis had kept their wor d. They did not resettle, 
quote/unquote, peoplewhere som ebody volunteered to go.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So Russians liberate you inApril of  1945. W hat was liberation like?
 
>> Bob Behr: W hat was liberation like?T his is alm ost diff icult to put into words.  In thosedays 
they didn'thave news cam eras and everything.  Liberation was m ixed em otions.  Nobody knew 
what the Russians would do to you.  Luckily m ostof thepeople in the cam p were f rom  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Czechoslovakia.  The languages resem ble each other. They're not identical but they resem ble 
eachother.  So thefact that you suddenly weref ree, could say what you want, could do what 
you want.  Theonly thing you could notdo is leave Theresienstadt, the cam p because we had 
T yphoid. T he Russians had to quarantine everybody and say nobody is going to get out 
because you have a disease which is contagious. So it was an experim ent.
 
 
I managed toescapeanyway.  I went back toBerlin
 t
o see if I couldget m y old 
apartm ent back
 i
f  it wasn't destroyed.  And itwasn't.  But it was full of  Germ an ref ugees who 
toldm e to go to hell in a handbasket
;  
they were not going to let mehave that apartm ent
 
because it was theirs.  The Germ an refugeeswho were bom bed outby the bad Americansand 
they are not going to give that apartm ent up.
 
 
So, what does yours truly do?  I wentto the Russian Kommandant.  I don't speak a 
word of  Russian. With a great dealof  luckI got ahold of  a Jewish Russianoff icer who spoke 
Yiddish.  Now, Yiddish and German canunderstandeach other. If  you speak Yiddish, you 
couldunderstand some Germ an.  So Itold that guy what happenedtom y apartment, that the 
refugees won't get outand I neededa placefor m y m otherand stepfather when I get them out 
of  t he  c am p.   H e  sa i d , "
O
h, we'll take careof  that."  He 
g ave
 
m ea Red Arm y soldier with a 
T omm y gun, and we went back to theapartment.T he sam e guy opened up againand said, 

"W
e t o
ld you cannot have."   I said," You seethis guy?"
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
And he said, " Yes."  he said, "

You're gone orelse he starts shooting.  He
