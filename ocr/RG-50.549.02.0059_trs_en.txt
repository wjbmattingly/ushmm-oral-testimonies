Interview with 
Estelle Klipp 
July 16, 1999 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Estelle Kli
pp, co nducted by Regina Baier, on July  16
th
, 1999, in 
Mrs. Klipp™s home. This is a follow up in
terview to a USHMM vi
deotaped in terview 
conducted with Estelle Kli
pp, on July second, 1995. Th
e United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum gratefully acknowled
ges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this 
interview possible. This is tape numb er one, side A. So  I did mention your name already, 
but it would be nice if you co
uld give us one mo re time, 
your full name, and also say 
when  you were born, and where. 
Answer: I™m Estelle K lipp, born Estella Guitla 
Feingarten, in Lodz, Poland, in 1922. So I 
actually am, if you want to know, I am 77 and a half years young. 
Q: And we are both sitting on 
the floor here. That™s nice
. So, I should say that you 
survived the ghetto in
 Lodz. You were transported to 
Auschwitz, where you stayed for 
just a little while. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Then you went to a camp -- a work ing 
ca -- a concentration working camp in -- 
A: First -- 

Q: -- in Germany? 

A: Yes.

Q: And what was it called again? 
A: First I was in Hamburg, and then I was in Zazel. 

Q: Oh, Hamburg, an d then 
Zazel, Germany for awhile. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And then  you went to Bergen
-B elsen death camp , in Germany? 
A: That™s correct.  
Q: And I would like to ask you, around 
the time -- and you were liberated from -- from 
Bergen-Belsen? 

A: Correct. 

Q: Speak a little bit ab out the time just before
 liberation. What was it like for you, what 

state of mind were you in? What was your -- y
our health at that time? Where were you? 
And then, when liberation happ
ened, what was that like? 

A: Mm-hm. Actually, when the 
liberation happened, I didn™t fe
el any ela-elation, because 
I was still in Bergen-Belsen. I was still lyi
ng on the floor of some
thing which looked like 
a very big barn. There were 
still mountains of skeletons 
around me, and the skeletons 
were actually people, who were once human be
ing. And then, also, you could see people 
with diarrhea, with typhus, running aimles
sly to the latrine and back. So, nothing 
changed, in a way, and so what I did, I wa
s lying on this floor. Somehow I got pencil and 
paper, and I did writing, and writi
ng, and writing. I wish I kept
 those papers, but I didn™t. 
Anyhow, we would --

Q: How did it -- how did it happen 
though? You were in a barrack? 
A: Yeah, it was -- it -- I was in a barrack, and 
they were saying that
 the English army is 
approaching, and they -- we should not go to
 the gate too early, because we might be 
shot. So we -- but -- and they opened the ga
tes, and -- and came in. Probably, wh en you 
have been in carcerated for su
ch a long time, you cannot switch. An yhow, in my case, 
besides that -- at that moment, actually -- may b
e not exactly that mome
nt, I realized that 
I™ll never see my parents again, because th
ere was no way for them to survive these 
horro rs. So, in a way, I started thinking abou
t my family, and I star
ted thinking about all 
these people who perished, and this writing pr
obably was a way to put my  feelings into  
papers. Now, I was, all this time, in the -- 
actually, the ghetto too, but we didn™t have 
much of a -- we didn™t see each other quite
 often, but I was with my  cousin, René 
Berlinska. We met at the place where we 
were supposed to board the trains for 
Auschwitz, and we stayed -- we were in Ausc
hwitz together, and we were in the camps 
together. And we survived toge
ther. So I actually, 
when they took us and -- from Zazel, I 
had a feeling that we are going to a camp wh
ere we won™t come out alive, so I jumped 
out of the train, but fortunately th ey did 
-- they picked  me up, and I was expecting 
afterwards that I will be punished, but I wa
sn™t. Probably, among this Nazi girls, there 
was already awareness that the war is being lo
st. So, that -- not always stopped them, and 
I™ll tell you later, for instance, with my hu
sband, who was -- who was liberated in Aren, 
close to Hanover, the SS load ed th em on a truc
k, and brought them 
someplace where they 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059

asked the Wehrmarkt to shoot 
them. However, the Wehrmarkt 
say, ﬁWe are soldiers, we 
don™t shoot people.ﬂ And th is way, 19 people
 were saved. Now we -- so we were moved 
to some quarters which -- my cousin believes 
they were army barrack
s, in Bergen-Belsen, 
and the -- we had a room, with eight other girl
s, and they were wonderful girls. We are -- 
we always have been frie
nds with them. Now, I -- 
Q: Was that after -- was that already liber
ation, or was that still before liberation 
[indecipherable] 

A: No, all what I™m saying 
now, they -- the Germans wouldn™
t have moved us. They  -- I 
mean, they wanted to  finish us off, you kno
w. But after the liberation, we have been 
transferred, so probably the 
very sick ones were, I assume, 
transferred to some ar -- to 
some -- so mething which was a hospital -- ma
ybe a makeshift hospital, but a hospital. 
Unfortunately, in their goodne
ss, the soldiers gave us food like ch ocolate, which we were 
not able to digest. I probably -- I don™t know 
why -- they did not consume any of this, and 
they -- so it didn™t affect me, but as trag
ic as it is, some 
people who already had 
problems, got very, very sick.  
Q: Who liberated you though? 
We haven™t said that yet. 
A: Yeah, woo -- I was liberated by the Eng lish army. And the -- so, I mean, as I said 

again, they wanted to 
-- they knew that we are starving. 
Now, they realized it pretty fast, 
that the food which we™ll be able to digest is
 a different food than 
-- then they fed us the 
right food. Now, when I was in this room 
with the girls, which 
-- it™s amazing when I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059

think about it, it seems that they were actu
ally very comfortable quarters, because in 
comparison what was before, bu
t my  energy was coming back , and so I decided to go and 
get clothes, and I found out that there is some
 distribution point in Hamburg. So I went to 
Hamburg, and when  I came back, I had a beautiful
 blue outfit, and I had also a hat, and I 
also brought some clothes for th
e girls with whom I was living. 
Q: How did you -- how did -- how were you 
able to go to -- to get to Hamburg? 
A: I think it was a train . You know, I tried to 
-- I tried to think about it, and in fact, when 
I came back, I was -- it was so impressive to  some people, they -- there was a younger 
man who wanted to marry me right away, an
d the -- my  resourcefulness was coming back 
to me. So I didn™t -- I f -- I was fortunate in
 a way that one day wh en I looked out, I saw 
somebody approaching, and who 
was it? It was the venerable Mr. Klipp, and I shouted 
out, ﬁPanya Klipp, Panya Klipp,ﬂ 

Panya is mi ster in Polish, and here he was.
 He used to be the -- the boss of the food 
supply in the ghetto. He was 
very respected, and he -- he 
was not only the head  of the 
office, but also the head of other departme
nts, and -- however, I remember one thing, 
which we -- I shouldn™t maybe say, that I had 
diarrhea. So I went to him, and wanted 
some rice. And he somehow refu sed to give it 
to me. And wh at was happening, he was an 
-- he was an unusual person with in -- impecc
able integrity, and so  he was allowed to 
have additional rations of food. He didn™t acce
pt that til his -- til his wife™s sister -- no, it 
was his own sister, his own sister,  was sick. So , of course, I was very happy to  see him, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059

it™s just l ike seeing somebody 
from the previous life, and he was -- he was liberated from 
Camp  Arlen, as I mentioned befo re, and he wa
s living in Hanover. I actually was hoping 
that my brother Hershlite Feingarten, whom 
we called Lolec, survived. He was only one 
and a half year older than I, and he was 
extremely capable, a
nd if he would have 
survived , he would have been a famous engi
neer, because as a child, he took apart our 
grandfather™s clock, and put it together, and si
nce he was missing a part, he used a string, 

and that fa -- gar -- grandfather™s clock wa
s work ing. Now, I also was hoping that 
Aroush, our adopted cousin, when
 he -- he was in the ghetto with his parents -- now, first 
his father was departed, then his mother wa
s deported, and then we did adopt him, and 
my mother [indecipherab
le] from a skin disease, and my 
father got the skin disease, I 
mu st have mentioned it on my  other tape. 

Q: That was in the ghetto, I think. 
A: That was in the ghetto, ri
ght. An yhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found 
my  brother, and I never found Aroush, bu
t I found out that my brother was in 
Buch enwald, and people actually saw him very
 shortly before the liberation. However, I 

looked fo r him, and I couldn™t find him.
 Neither did I find Aroush. And Aroush -- I 
remember when Aroush was born, the joy, a
nd the festivities were ab
solutely wonderful. 
We were celebrating for a whole week, and th
e -- the whole family was just elated. Now 
we -- I mentioned th at Dave was in Hamburg when  I was in my  quest to look fo r Lolec 

and Aroush, I went to Hanover. 
In Hanover, I worked afterwar
ds in a -- in a dep -- in a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
8
 
 
 
 
 
place where a -- there was a representation of
 UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W-
A, which means United Nations 
relief, and we were distributing food. So I worked there 
for a time, and there I had th
e honor to meet Mayor LaGu
ardia. He was work ing for 
UNRRA, and he was visiting the distribution cen
ters, so I have a picture of him, and -- 
and when we were talking to
 him, you could see in his 
expression the horror, and the 
unbelief in his face. He just stopped for aw
hile, and just looked
 really very, very 
unpleasantly impressed.  
Q: So, he had only limited informa
tion of what -- what had happened? 
A: Probably, because the -- I 
will show you the pictures, a
nd you can see from his face 
that he just couldn™t believe it. I guess, judgi
ng from the word s of Eisenhower, he says he 
has to document it, because 
nobody, but nobody would believe
 it, w h at they did to so 
many people. And th e -- so, it is really very
 difficult to comprehend. Now, as the time 
passes by, to tell you the truth, it™s much mo
re for me to comprehe
nd how all this was 
possible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am
 very busy, but the pictures, let™s say, of 
Auschwitz, they are always -- 
anyhow, quite frequently, very
 vividly in my  mind. And 
now, wh en I was making th at tape, I didn™t me
ntion th at a person whom I approach to ask 
for my mother, going on my side
 of the line, which meant work
, I didn™t realize then that 
it meant life, it was M engele, and the -- in my 
husband™s ta -- tape, 
it™s mentioned that it 
was Mengele. Now, we are in Hanover.

Q: Wh-W hy was it -- why was it that you we
nt in your search for your family to 
Hanover, because there are -- were more reso urces to find -- wa -- 
A: No, at that time -- at that 
time, we did not have a registry
 yet. You know, it was just by 
talking to  people, wh ich I did, so I was told 
that they saw him, so my hopes were really 
up, but it -- all the search wh
ich I made, was in vain.  
Q: What -- what time was that now? 

A: That was still 1945, because we were liber
ated in -- I believe it was April. It was still 
19 fa -- it was very shortly after, I just star
ted the search right -- right after. Now, in 

Hanover, Dave, shortly after, I don™t know the ex
act date, Dave realized that the refugees 
are just lost, and h-he contacted the German
 authorities to -- to organize some facilities 
where we can get food rations, where they -- 
we can get housing, wh en the -- when  we 
can get directions. And he was quite successf
ul, thanks to his mastery of the German 
language, he was -- til the last minish he wa
s able to write a lett
er in German, really 
beautifully, and without mistakes
, I was always very impressed with it. And he also had a 
busin essman™s background. So , he organized 
that, and it functioned for quite awhile, and 
it was an enormous help. So, I was living 
-- you know, it was mu
ch nicer living in 
Hanover. There were also many refugees ther
e, many survivors, and they -- of course 
there was Dave, who was only 17 years older th
an I was. However, with his energy, and 
his equanimity, and his wonderful attitude to
wards people, chronologically there was a 
difference, but in en ergy level, and in zest of
 life, we -- actually was none. So, we did get 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
10
 
 
 
 
 
married, and we got married on March 16, 1946. 
Most of the survivors in Hanover were -
- I would say, were at the wedding, and who 
officiated over that ceremony was an elderly 
man who was from German origin, and -- and he
 was really qualified to -- to conduct the 
ceremony. And the -- I have, of course, pictures. 
I have the pictures of the other survivors 
who attended the wedding. Now what -- of c
ourse, we wanted to -- to leave Germany, 
and the destination was very easy for us to  d
ecide, because Dave™s  -- Dave knew that he 
has a sister in New York , but Dave was lib
erated by the Americ
ans, and one of the 
American army  personnel promised him to get 
in touch with his sister, which he did, and 
we started even receiving letters from her, and 
of course our destina
tion, because of that, 
was to go and jo in his sister, her husband,
 and they had a -- a son who was going to  
college, studying accounting.  
Q: Can I ask you two -- two -- two question?
 What was -- what were the conditions in 
Germany at that time, in -- in Hanover? 
A: In the beginning -- now, we -- we actually
 did not expect mu ch, considerin g our past. 
Now we were giving food through the UNRRA,
 then , of course, is a -- many people were 
living on Oberstrasser .  Oberst
rasser was the seat of -- before the war, that was the 

Yiddish geminda, which means like stat the 
council -- the council of the -- and, so -- 
Q: The consulate? 
A: No, n-not the consulat
e, the council. Stat -- 
Q: The council, right. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
 
A: The council. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And the -- so it was the Yiddish geminda
, and the -- well, these q u arters were 
available to the refugees. And then once th
ese facilities w ere establish, which my 
husband was happy to establish, then we also
 were able to get housing with some German  
families. A nd we also were able to get 
food rations, and the 
-- so life became more 
livable. 
Q: Was it difficult though, to live with 
German people, so shortly after -- 
A: See, that is a very interesting question. 
We didn™t want to stay in Germany, because 
we didn™t know who, of the people in Ge
rmany, was instrumental in this horrors. 
However, the German people have a way of 
being very  hospitable. And you would never 
believe that this people were able to do what 
they did, or being byst
anders, and not relac -
- react. So i -- 
Q: So, they were qu
ite nice to you then? 
A: Oh, some, some. But we never knew when we
 spoke to them, or ha
ve been with them, 
what their background is. So, of course, most 
of the people -- for instance there was Pater 
Dana, who was a German, and 
became a great friend of my
 husband™s, and he -- and 

there were other people who became friends of my  husband. I mean, he -- David Klipp 
had a fantastic personality, and just -- people ju
st loved him. Everybody who -- whom he 
touched, loved him and respect
ed him. So, there were some German  people who -- who 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
 
even used to come late
r on, wh en we had a better living he
 -- headquarters that they are -- 
actually came to our house. Now 
to -- to answer your question,
 that™s -- that™s why never 
occurred to ask to stay in Germany. And in
 -- where are we actually? We are -- okay, so 
Dave is -- was work ing, he was 
very busy in th
e place, and --  
Q: What did you -- 
what did you do? 
A: I was also busy, I was work
ing from yo -- in the other place, and also in the -- our first 
child, Philip Klipp was born in 19 four -- wa
it a second, we bus -- he was born in 1947, 
oh yeah, that™s right, 1947, June
 eight. And that was absolutely th e greatest joy, because 
it was, in a way, a miracle, because we we
re suspecting that we were getting something 
in the food which will prevent us fro
m being able to bear children. 
Q: In Auschwitz?  
A: Yeah, is -- i-in the Auschwitz, or maybe 
-- probably  it would have been in Au schwitz. 
S-So we -- now, about the -- we wanted to, of
 course, emigrate. Now, I used to have in 
the ghetto, I had pleu risy, which is water 
-- water on the lungs, and wh en I went to 
Auschwitz, actually, I had still water on the lung
s, I had swollen legs, and I had a blood 
infection. And, believe it or not, that after 
we spent the first night
 in Auschwitz on the 
ground, I awoke and I didn™t have the blood 
infection. I still have the -- had the swollen 
legs, which was a big handicap wh en we were
 in Hamb urg, and I had to climb up on the 
wagon which took us to wo rk. 
The girls had to help me, a
nd the pleurisy also lasted 
awhile. Now, what actually helped 
-- I moved, did I disturb anything? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
13
 
 
 
 
 
Q: That™s fine, don™t worry about it. 
A: From Au schwitz, we went to Hamburg, it™
s in my  tapes, and then from Hamburg, we 
went to Zazel. Zazel was not far from Hambur
g, but it was located in woods. Somehow, 
being able to breathe the good air, to which I 
am very, very sensitive, helped me to get 
over the pleurisy, and also my  swelling of my
 legs disappeared. Now, I have to add, 
which is also in my  tape, that I was fortuna
te, I spoke to th e doctor who was taking care 

of the health problem of the soo -- of
 the people in th
e camp. She was from 
Czechoslo vakia if I am not mistaken, and I men
tioned to her my  qualifications, and that I 
finished high school, and had 
my graduation papers, and wh at my  background is, that I 
could be helpful to her, and she accepted that
, and for awhile I was working there, and I 
was, of course, cleaning and washing the fl
oor from the wrong end. And wh en the people 
coming from the camp , I was interviewing eith
er na -- interviewing them, helping the 
docto r, and keeping the books. Eventually I did 
-- I did go to work outside, and we were 
build ing -- we were digging foundations fo r 
-- for some buildings. Now, maybe here I 
will inject something why I su
rvived. Now, if an
ybody in my family would have been 
asked who is the least likely to survive,
 I would be the first candidate. But -- 
Q: Why? 

A: Why? I used to be -- I use s -- I -- I didn™t 
eat. I actually didn™t eat. I was giving my -- 
my  lunch to a beggar, I had my  own beggar. I 
didn™t eat any breakfast. I had some dinner, 

and my  mother was very concerned. Sh e used 
to come to school sometimes when I was a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
14
 
 
 
 
 
s-smaller, and -- to feed 
me. That could have also helped 
me to survive, because I wasn™t 
as hungry, and my  body did not demand as
 mu ch food as other -- I -- was demanding 
from other people, who had a good diet. Also, I 
-- it is -- it was a face, it was th e spirit. I 
believed that we will survive. And on this wa
y going back to -- to 
this camp in Zazel, 
where we were once marching back
 from work to -- to the camp
, we saw houses, lit, with 
people living their normal life
. Usually they  kept us away from the population, and my  
cousin asked me, ﬁWill we ever live like that?ﬂ And I said, ﬁRania, I am sure w e will.ﬂ 
Q: I™m -- I™m sorry. We have
 to change the cassette. 
A: Okay . 
Q: This is the end of tape one, side A, inte
rview with Estelle Klipp.
 But we will pick up 
on th at. 
A: Okay . 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation -- well, this was a 
car coming by, but this 
is a continuation of a 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inte
rview with Estelle Klipp. This is tape 
number one, side B. And we have been just
 interrupted  in speaking about why you think 
you have surviv ed, that had in
 part to do with not need ing 
as much food as -- as -- as 
others, but also with a certain
 kind of spirit, probably . 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059

A: Somehow, even in the ghe
tto, the mother of Aroush, wh
ich I me ntioned before, we 
were not really doing a lot of visiting, th
ere was no time for that, and there was -- it 
wasn™t an atmo sphere where you just go vis
iting. But whenever I came to her house, she 
was so happy, because I was full of hope. When  I went to the krippo -- it™s kriminalpoisi, 
where many people didn™t come out alive, I 
went in, I remember. 
My mother was there 
already, my father was there already, and 
my brother was there already. But when I 
walked in and there was Souter, who was the 
head of the ghetto -- 
of the kriminalpoisi, 
sorry -- I left. I was lau ghing. And he says, 
ﬁDas laken vilderkil hafher gaya.ﬂ And I 
really did. However, there was something about it -- also, when in
 the -- still in Lodz, 
after the nateez -- Nazis came to Lodz, which 
they named Litzmanshtadt afterwards, we 
were supposed to wear a yellow star, and 
I had a girlfriend, Gernia Finkelstein from 
school, and she didn™t want to go out. I said
, ﬁGernia, look. We have nothing to be 
ashamed of. Let the people who do it to us, let them be ashamed of it.ﬂ I somehow -- I 
was also praying. I usually pray in my  own wo
rds, and as a child, I used to get up in  bed -
- well, I fig u red that I shouldn™t do it in ly
ing position, and I prayed. And I remember in 
Hamburg, where we were in that camp in Ham
burg, we had to get up 
very early, the stars 
were still o n  the firmament, and I looked at th
e stars. W e had to line up so that we were 
chosen to go to work, and wh
ere to go to work, and I was 
standing th ere, and looking at 
the heaven s, and I was praying fo r my self, 
for my mother, my fa
ther, and my whole 
family. And now, it™s likely that prayer is ve
ry powerful, and it infl
uences the body. So  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
16
 
 
 
 
 
that was -- my spirituality was 
also a reason, probably, which 
helped me to survive. Also, 
once, when I was in Camp Z
azel, I brought some food fro
m the place where we were 
work ing, and when  I came back, I was being 
punished . And the punishment was that I 
was supposed to clean the latrines. And some
how, as -- in my  recollection, I didn™t mind 
it a bit. Probably I was happy th at I didn™t ge
t a much, much more severe punishment. So, 
i-it -- it was the spirit, also I never, during the wh
ole ordeal, felt inferior. I always felt that 
they are doing it to us, but th
at we are not inferior. I -- ma
ybe should we talk now a little 
bit about anti-Semitism, or that™s not -- I™m ac
tually very tolerant. 
I feel that different 
expressions of religion, art, language -- are ac
tually very beneficial
 to the culture of a 
country. And teeb -- you f -- you sometimes
 find people saying that Jews cause anti-
Semitism. I -- but even among Jews you sometimes hear such a statem
ent. It™s the -- in 
my mind, it is definitely, but definitely not
 the truth. Anti-Semitis
m is caused by other 
people. Now, it is in the human nature that 
it™s easy to blame so
me body, and it makes it 
easier to handle certain things, and sometimes
 even governments, in
 order to put the 
blame, eith er for some econo
mical disasters or shortcomi
ngs, or other shortcomings, 
needed  somebody to blame, and someone who 
is not protected, or whose rights can be 
taken away at will, is a -- is a scap egoat.Because, when we look 
actually at what the 
Jewish people contribute to the countries wh
ere they were living, they s -- I would say 
that there is a reason to be anti-Semitic. Also, which is quite interesting, there is now 

anti-Semitism in countries where there are no 
Jews. In Poland, there are actually no Jews 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059

to be talked about, and they 
are very anti-Semitic, in spite of
 Pol -- of the Pope™s powel -- 
efforts to change it. So, you -- we talk about
 the state of Israel, which historically, and 
when you look at the 
archaeology, and when you read the 
history, it is as -- it is the land 
of the Jews. And only having 
a place where we will be protected, and there will be an 
action if there is anti-Semitis
m in whatever form, which ha
s been before, like pogroms, 
like Auschwitz, then there is so
mebody, we are not unprotected. And by the same token, 
we might not be so -- such easy targets. A
nd besides that, there's the only place in the 
world where there is a law of rittem, and peop
le can actually, if they are Jewish -- some 
who are not Jewish also, can come in, whet
her it is from Ethiopia, which used to be 
Abyssinia. Whether it is from Iran , whether 
it is from an-any countr
y where -- where the 
conditions are fertile for anti-Semitism, there is
 a place to go. A-Also , I mean, of course, 
it™s not only si -- some  people wish to go th
ere for other reasons, of course the gates are 
also open. 

Q: Let™s -- let™s talk about that a little bit la
ter. I would like to go back to Hanover one 
more time before we [indecipherable] 

A: Yes? 

Q: And there are two sort of priv ate questio
ns, if you will. Was it helpful -- was it easier 
for you to have a survivor 
as a partner at that time? 
A: Definitely. Def -- I mean, the question is
 whether it was easier for me to have a 
partner, a survivor. There are two things. Defi
nitely, because people have so much in 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
18
 
 
 
 
 
common. I mean, we were -- our make-up was 
not exactly the same. 
He was very much a 
extrovert. I am partially extrovert, but 
partially a introvert. However, having the 
background, we could understa
nd what™s happening in  our lif
e. We could understand how 
we think. And actually, many, many -- I would 
say, the majority of
 survivors married 
either survivors, or people who were in Ru
ssia, and came back, and I have one friend 
who married a survivor, but un
fortunately he passed away, Simaja, and afterwards, she 
married American man, a teacher. Now everyt
hing is working out fi
ne, so it might have 
work ed -- and I know so me other people wh o 
married not a survivor and it is working out 
alright, but I feel -- I feel
 so much con -- so much mo
re connected. And then I 
remembered Mr. Klipp from the 
ghetto, he was my  boss there, and when  I was in -- and 
when my mother was in Kri
ppo, he one time was helpful th
at we got a little bit more 
food. And besides that, he was a wonderful ma
n, a man of integrity, a man of energy, a 
man of -- unusual man who, as I mentioned be
fore, anybody wh om he touched, or who 
touched him, loved him and resp
ected. So he actually -- wh en I think abou -- about my 
accomplishments, one of the -- I feel the 
greatest accomplishment was to keep him 
healthy. So, he was not -- he -- you couldn™t
 call him a man who is of poor health, 
however, he was very sick in Germany, he had appendectomy. Later he had the phlebitis, 

and then  he had the emboli. Bu t he surviv
ed. Then, in the United States -- maybe I™ll 
come to that later.

Q: Yeah, let™s wait a little bit, because I have
 a -- another question with regard to your 
family. What kind of hopes an
d -- and wishes, and plans did 
you have for your children? 
You wanted children, you -- you had a boy. 
A: Two, two. 
Q: In -- in -- in ™47, you had one. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So what was -- what 
was that like? What -- 
A: Okay . To answer your question wh at I s 
-- want for my child
ren. In the Jewish 
tradition, anyhow the tradition in
 Poland before the war, 
which I remember, th e most 
important things was education. You could hear
 us saying, they can take everything away  
from you, but they cannot take away your 
education. And this really became true, 
because even in my case, whatev
er I learned, I could keep, all else was taken away. So of 
course, I guess the trad ition is quite a long trad
ition, because even befo
re children in the r 
-- I mean, many years ago, when
 there were no public school
s for -- available, a child 
who was three years old, a Jewish child, wa
s going to  hadahadel, 
and he had to learn 
Hebrew letters, and -- s-so there was education 
even  at the times when other schools were 

not available. And [indecipherable] really lik
e to learn more about 
the Torah, about the 
Mishnah, about the other books, because ther
e mu st be a certain wisdom in it, because 
there was one survivor, he surviv
ed in Italy, a Dr. Noyhaus, wh
o told  us that wh en he was 
in the -- he was on Aryan papers, that when  he
 s -- when he went to
 the university, what 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
20
 
 
 
 
 
he learned from these books was very help
ful, even the medical aspects of that 
knowledge were very helpfu
l. So we -- the question wh
ich I am answering now, is? 
Q: Oh, what -- what plans and ho
pes you had for [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, so the -- the -- the most
 important, the priority was th
at they should
 be educated, 
and my sons, both sons, are well educated. Th
ey have Masters degree. Philip was a very 
good student in college. In Fairfax High a very
 -- a -- a -- high school was very famous 
[indecipherable] camp  is one of them. And he wa
s so bright, that in the last year of col -- 
of high school, he was chosen
 to  attend UCLA. So he a
ttended each simu ltaneously. He 
was also very interested in linguistic, so he
 switched to computers later on, and he got 
him Masters in the Boise Univ ersity. Now, my younger s
on, Charles Klipp, who was 
born in 1951, on my  birthday, he was also -- we
 were very lucky, he 
was also very bright, 
and a very  good student, and learning cam
e to him [indecipherable] extremely easy, 
which he was very mu ch envied by other stud
ents who had to study hard. He also got his 
Masters in business administratio n. And so th
ey both have very good education. They  
also had violin lessons, and Ch arlie was playi
ng as a -- in junior high he was playing in 
the Madame Bloom Orchestra. And we  had 
the good fortune that this orchestra and 
Charlie playing the violin, was playing at the 
opening of the mu sic center in Los Angeles 
a day befo re Christma s, and of course, all our 
friends, and our family, 
went to listen to it. 
I was very much interested, and I was with 
anticipation looking to 
opening of the mu sic 
center there in Los Angeles.

Q: So we are already in Ameri
ca now, but let™s [indecipherable] 
A: But we have to go back. 
Q: -- we have to -- we have 
to -- we have to go back -- 
A: We have to -- 
Q: -- to come here again. 
So when your s -- yo
ur second son was born already in 
America, 1951. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So when did it finally happen, when  coul
d you go to America,
 and how did you go? 
A: Okay. What -- now, in or
der to get to America, we had to go to a medical 
examination, and they were especially concer
ned that we should not
 have tuberculosis, 
which I can understand, and since I had pleu ri
sy in ghetto, and later also in the camp, 
there is a scar, which mimi cs 
actually a scar of the tuberculosis. So it took many, many 
exam -- medical examination t -- til they decided that it™s not an
ything which should 
prevent me of getting a permit to go to th
e United States. And th
is happened i -- the 
permit we received in 1950. A
nd we went to New York with
 the ship, Captain Macrae, 
and -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: I moved, sorry. 
Q: Oh, you have a picture,
 you have a photograph. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
 
A: I have a picture wh at I wanted to show 
to Regina. Also, my  husband, sh -- who was 
very organized, wrote that we le
ft Bremenhaven on Ap ril the 12
th
, and we arrived in 
Halifax on April the 21
st
, and then we arrived 
in New York, on April 24
th
. We also wrote 
who of the survivors were on our ship, but I 
don™t know whether I should mention that. 
Should I mention? 
Q: If you want to, yes. [indecipherable] be nice. 

A: Yeah, there was -- y ou know, down, it 
was Mr. Berstin -- Sander Berstin, Abram 
Hoover, Aaron Dunst, D-u-n-s-
t, Samu el Showser, Shlama Zi
fe, an d Mort Kazai. This 
time, they didn™t seem to have been married
, or maybe he just mentioned th e men, I don™t 

know. And we arrived in Ne
w York , and the -- our brother-in-law Simon was waiting for 
us, and he fell in love with 
Philip. Philip had beautiful, blonde
, curly hair. And the -- they 
brought us to their house, and they  were very, 
very hospitable. They gave us their ba -- be 
-- bedroom, and all the family, mo stly of cour
se, the family of Simon, because Helen™s -- 
Helen, wh o was the sister of my  husband, 
lost all her family 
in Europe during the 
Holocaust. And so Simon™s family came over, a
nd they ™re very friendly, and made us feel 

good, and I heard some comments 
that, ﬁHow is it that Dave 
has such a beau tiful, young 

wife?ﬂ Of course, if they woul
d know Dave better, they woul
d not be so surprised. And 
now, New York  has the advantage that we ha
ve family there, however, since  Dave was 
so sick, which I mentioned, in Germany, the 
climate affected his health, and he wasn™t 
feeling well. In the meantime, we receive
d letters from L o s Angeles, from people who 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
 
survived , and telling us about the wonderfu
l climate, and the wonderful possibilities. 
Now, the decision wasn™t easy, but we hope
d that Helen and her 
family will follow us. 
So, remember, it wasn™t a easy decision, as 
I mentioned before, but we decided to go. 
Now Helen was afraid of planes, so we took 
the train, and on our -- on our way to arrive 
in the unite -- to arrive in 
Los Angeles. Now, I learned so
me English in Germany, which 
was very fortunate, and I thought I knew more
 than I really knew, but it was really 
helpfu l to get through on th e train, and arrived here. I -- 

Q: Okay . I would like to st
op fo r just one second.  
A: Sure. 
Q: Okay, we are going again. I just wanted 
to  ask you whether, at this point, there was 
anything that you had noticed ab out America, 
or that you had seen on the train, for 
instance, that was different, and -- or inte
resting, or even di
sturbing. Did you -- 
A: No, I actually -- I enjoyed the train ride. I en
joyed being alive. I really enjoy. As much 
as the moment I was liberated, I didn™t feel
 any elation, later on, I was -- I had some 
elation. I was happy that I am alive. And I 
remember th at once, walking someplace, and I 

said -- and looking at the sky, an d seeing all th
e beauty of nature, I was really happy to be 

alive. S -- and the -- some people felt guilty 
-- that -- I heard that saying, I never met 
somebody who really -- from whom I heard it.
 They felt -- they fe
lt guilty that they 
survived. But, becau
se we survive, we bear witness.
 Because we survive, there is a 
continuation of -- of the people who lo st 
their lives. Because we survive, we have 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
 
children, we have grandchildren, we have 
a second generation who 
already is a little bit 
active in trying to remember
 what happens. And the me
mory is important for two 
reasons. Once, we owe it to the people who pe
rished, and then, it is quite a lesson for 
history, which hopefully, hopefully, will be 
taken in considerati
on. What can happen -- 
what actually can happen when the rights 
are being taken away, and how important 
democratic governments are, 
and how important that people
 can have their say. That 
there is a difference of opinion that™s fine, a
nd hopefully -- so, that™s why it™s good that a 
-- we survive. If we wouldn™t 
sur-survive, it -- if it would 
happen, what H
itler planned, 
the Final So lution, they  would have mu rdered  
us all. And even  today there are the deniers 
of the Holocaust, which seem to -- they be
 -- are becoming a little bit quieter. Imagine if 
we wouldn™t survive. 
Q: So, when you arrived in Lo
s Angeles, what was that - - 
A: Okay, so I -- I -- oh, we arrived in Los 
Angeles, and the weather was good, and the -- 
our family was expecting us. So, it was rea
lly  -- it was different, it w as different. Now, 
we didn™t have a place to live, really. I mean
, we li -- we were livin
g with our -- were -- 
my  sister-in-law, and we got along splend
idly , and also with my  brother-in-law. 
However, because they didn™t feel good, we 
thought not to start our life in New York, 
since it affected his health, th
at we should go to  Los Angeles, and it was a good idea. We 
only regret that Helen and Sim
on, and their son Arnold did not
 follow us, though th ey did 
come to visit, and they
 liked Los Angeles very 
much. And so we are -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
 
Q: So how -- how did you esta
blish a life then? So you -- 
you lived with your sister-in-
law? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: For awhile? And then what -- di
d you follow education, did you -- 
A: No, we were not there very long, we were
 only three weeks. All -- all we w ere there 
was three weeks. 

Q: Okay . 
A: So -- because we had to make the decisi
on fast la -- because you know, you have to 
make a living. You have to make a living. 
So we came to Los Angeles. And we were 
picked up at the station, a
nd then  we stayed by cousin 
René, whom I mentioned before, 
was here living already with her husband
, and sh e was going to  school to learn 

accounting, and we stayed with 
them for awhile, and also th
ere was that Siteling family 
who -- who were very hospitable to us, and ev
erybody, of course, adored  Ph il. And then  
we started looking fo r a place to live, and we
 found it, we found the right place in of 
course, in Bull Heights, where most of the 
survivors lived, and we 
found a lovely place, 
and the school was across the street, and th
e semi-free medical fa
cilities were down the 
street, it was Breed Street. And the elementary
 school was across th e street. So -- and -- 
and I could see the sky, which I -- I wa -- we --
 I was ela -- elated, and it was a very good 
move. Now, Dave, before the war, in about ‚
32, he started a busin e
ss, and he was very 
successful, that was in Lodz. 
And then he was -- then the 
war broke out, of course, and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
 
they took everything away, an
d he was also ready [indecipherable] it in a way, very 
respected in -- even in Germany. And all 
the survivors didn™t called him by his first 
name, they usually said, Panya Klipp. And 
-- because they respected him so much. And 
we came here, and he worked in the ware
house, and on the weekend he was selling 
shoes. And he never, but never comp lained. An
d s -- now, we lived there, and we had -- 

we were very fortunate, we had Mexican-
American neighbors on one side, and the 
children were watching televisi
on there, we didn™t have a te
l -- TV, and they was really 
helpfu l. One time, the father of this coupl
e, who didn™t speak -- I don™t know how we 
communicated. Anyhow, he took me
 with the car -- I didn™t drive, I didn™t have a car. 
And he to ok me to see the docto r, which 
was living on f -- which was -- had his office 
moved to  Fairfax approximately. And it was so na
tural to do it, but pe
ople in this doctor™s 
office were really surprise
d. And th en, on th e other -- 
Q: Why were they surprised? 

A: They were surprised that he would take 
me all the way, and wait for me, and take me 
back. They were really
 surprised. I mean, we were so 
used to, because our friends, you 
know, who were also survivors,
 we were always ready to he
lp one another. So then the -- 
on th e other side, the family moved in, also 
with children, the Gailses, and they were 

survive -- they were act
ually sur-survivors, but 
they survived 
in England. And -- so our -- 
we also became friends, and ex
changed babysitting. 
And they -- this girls were appro -- 
this girls and our boys played together, and th
en we become very friendly with the Lazar 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
 
family, whose daughters were al
so the same age as Philip and 
Charlie, and this was really 
our ex tended family, and we used to visit one
 another on a weekend,
 and wh en Sofie had 
surgery, the girls staye d  with 
us, and we loved it, and they  we
re so thankful for it, but it 
was really a privilege of ours. 
Q: Okay. I think this would be a good time to 
stop again. This is the 
end of tape one, side 
B, interview with Estelle Klipp. 
A: Okay . 
End of Tape One, Side B 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Estelle Klipp. This is tape number two, side
 A. So, you had a -- a nice support system of -
- of friends here in the city, and your 
husband had work , andyou were bringing up 
children. Did -- di-did you speak to -- to non-
Jewish Americans about your experience at 
all? Did they want to know, or was there not 
a sensitivity to it, or is it something that you 
didn™t talk about? 
A: Okay. Now, I failed to men tion that in Bull Heights, we
 lived together in the same 
little house with Basha and Max Birnbaum, other 
surviv ors. It was really nice, because 
when  they  went to school in th e evening,
 and we prepared some
thing, and they came 
back, and they had refreshments, and it wa
s so -- Max couldn™t stand mu ch noise, 
however, we got along splendi
dly, and it was lovely . And I reme mb er when  I -- Basha 
was sitting on the stairs, on the day I -- I was su
pposed to go to the hospital because I had 
Caesarian with Charlie, first I took Philip to 
th is medical facility for a check-up. And she 

said -- and she just was so -- s - - she was rea
lly very su rprised that I could do that, and 
then go to the hospital. And 
the -- who took me to the hos
pital was Jerry Sitelin, who 
lives in Los Angeles, and whos
e family was instrumental in 
convincing us to come to Los 
Angeles, and he was going to drive me. He 
w as also a su rvivor fro
m th e same c a mp  as 
my -- as my husband. And here 
his father™s -- he and his fath
er were in the camp, and he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
29
 
 
 
 
 
was young, he was one of the youngest one. 
So he was to -- going to the army , and he 
brought me to the hospital to give birth to Charles. 
 Now -- 

Q: Do you know wh ether it wa
s difficult for him to go to 
the army? I mean, he just 
survived  a war, and now  he had to go 
to the army, did y
ou talk about that? 
A: I talked to him a few days ago, and he
 was telling me about it.
 And he took it as a 
matter of fact. I mean, he did not -- he actu
ally did not comp lain, or anything. He was 
fortunate, they sent him to 
Germany, and he™s -- Germany™s 
really good, because he was 
there for awhile. And he -- a marvelous son. He
 was such a devoted son, I think his father 
survives thanks -- thanks to him, and he surv
ives thanks to his father, because he has a 
goal, to keep his father alive.
 I think that -- that™s also -- 
was helpful, you -- we have a 
goal, and then we can take much more. 

Q: I did ask you, however, did you speak ab
out your war time experience to -- to non-
survivors, to [indecipherable] 
A: Okay, at that time, it was not the thing to
 do. It™s very interesting the progression of 
when talking about the Holoca
ust became proper. There was he
re a family o -- which, she 
was a survivor, and he married Eva, a lovely 
woman, and she was so nice to us. She took 
us -- she was an American. She 
took us out to Knottsberry Fa
rm, and of course paid for 
it, and took us places, and invite
d us to her beautiful house, 
and -- but I don™t think that 
we really talked about it. It was too grim, 
it was too -- i-i-it was bel -- beyond belief, and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
 
people were not ready to talk, and people were
 not even more, ready 
to listen. They also 
went through a war where they
, you know, where they™ve lo
st some  loved ones. They  
were not ready to listen. The change o
ccurred with some -- w
ith some program on 
television, I think, and slowly it 
-- people started talking about it. 
Q: Do you mean perhap s the 
NBC series ﬁHolocaust,ﬂ in
 1978, I believe? That was 
[indecipherable] 
A: Possible, possible. Possible. 
Q: Don™t you think that was -- th ere wa
s a distinct change [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, there was a d-distinct change wa
s wh en it was just brought up on television 
then, and people somehow were ready to ta
lk about it, or to -- or to listen. 
Q: Was it difficult for you not to
 talk about it, or was it -- 
A: No, I will tell you what, we were just busy 
living. Making a living, bringing up the 
children, thinking of the future
. So, the 1939 Club, organization of the survivors, mo stly 
from Poland, was organized quite early, which 
wa -- I was active for awhile there, and I 

have a picture, I will show it to you, where 
I™m being given a-award 
for that work. Now, 
my husband, I will tell you later, was their 
treasurer for 17 years, and that was very 
helpful for the surv
ivors, because in the be
ginning they were meeting in people™s houses. 
Then, when the financial situation of the surv
ivors was better, we were able to meet in a 
rented hall, and finally there were many occa
sions, and we also had orchestra, and fo r 
awhile the Jewish Federation in Los Angeles 
did not actually accep
t anybody from us as 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
31
 
 
 
 
 
a me mb er, which ch -- which ch anged comp lete
ly right now, and we are very  much 
respected, and they come to our
 affairs, and the -- that -- 
Q: What -- why did they not 
accept anybody as a me mber ? 
A: It takes time for people to accept. It take
s time, and you have to wo rk fo r it, you have 
to show what you can do, you ha
ve to show what positions 
you have. You have to show 
how educated your children are, and manyof us, you know, like Mr. Sam Goetz, became 

-- you know, was educated and finished US
C, and was active there. His wife has a 
Masters in German, and there are other people
 who are librarians, and they were quite -- 
were highly educated. 

Q: But just -- just to clarify 
that, that™s -- that™s important, 
I think. So, there was a certain 
perception of survivors, if I understand you co
rrectly then, even am
ong the -- even with 
the Jewish Federation? 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Q: So what was -- there was so
me  kind of prejudice, some 
kind of let™s say perception -- 
what -- 

A: I reme mber the saying th at we would like 
to be on the board , and it took a long time, 
but the switch is absolutely amazin g, be
cause we -- now we are -- they are always 
representative of the Jewish Federation comi
ng to  our affairs. We are donating to  their 
causes, and things changed. 

Q: But what was the perception?

A: I could not tell. I could not tell. I don™t ac
tually blame them. I think -- I think now, th e 
attitude towards the Russian people who cam
e -- of course, they were not in the 
concen tration camps, they were 
not in Auschwitz, is already 
different, and they are -- the 
willingness to -- to help, is al
so greater, because now, since we are established, and since 
we are -- most of us anyhow, are doing well, 
and want to contribute
 both financially, and 
with our work, to our -- the Jewish community, and all 
the others, not Jewish causes, we 
are respected. You have to earn it, probably.  
Q: So tell me a little bit more about this cl
ub. Do you ro ughly know
 when it was -- and it 
was sort of in the begin -- it was a social club, o-or a -- 
A: Oh, there is -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: It started, actually, a social club, and th
ere is a whole book about it, about the 1939 
Club. No w, maybe I should tell you now ab out 
-- what year was it, let me see. Anyhow, 
my  husband started working fo r the 1939 Cl
ub as a treasurer, when, under the guidance 
and ideas of Dr. Sam Goetz, the chair of 
Holocaust studies was established at UCLA. 
When you are on the UCLA campus, close 
to Ralbunch building, you will see on a 
column , a plaque with great names, and am
ong th em is the name of David and Estelle 
Klipp, and others, all, if I™m not mistaken
, me mb ers of the 1939 Club, who contributed 
financially and otherwise, to th
e establishment of this chair. Now, Dr. Sam Goetz is really 
to be commended very , very highly for his 
idea, which seemed strange fo r some people 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
 
who could not unde
rstand the significance of establis
hing su ch a chair. Now -- this chair 
now, actually from the very beginning, had 
very good professors
, some who came from 
Israel, and then Professor Fr
iedlander, who was just recently awarded the genius re -- 
genius award, and who wrot
e -- who™s writing many books, and he was teaching in  
Switzerland, and after awhile -- that was a gr
eat accomplishment that 
he consented to be 
head of this chair in Los A
ngeles. But there were previous
ly, also, very, very famous 
professors, and the attendance in this classe
s was absolutely great.
 One time there were 
300 students. And I don™t know exact numbe
r now, and also now there are graduates 
from this chair, who teach the Ho
locaust. And th -- I think, as 
an -- out of this example, 
there is now a chair of Holocaust studies 
at Yale, and many othe
r universities. So my 
husband realized the importance of it, and he 
was a very busy man, working, head of a 
office, a large office, and he consented to
 be the treasurer, b
ecause they needed 
somebody who can handle it, a
nd my  husband had the accounting background, and he -- 
and he was in this position fo r 17 years. E
ach year they had to 
change the -- the laws, 
allowing him to become treasur
er for another year. And the 
-- the 1939 Club is -- I think 
was a very wonderful idea. And there is a boo
k about it, and it™s very -- our minutes are 
being sent to some archives, yes. 
Q: So, what -- when -- 
when, about, was the as -- when was that chair established, that 
was in the -- in the 70™s, or in the 80™s, about? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
34
 
 
 
 
 
A: Let me see. If -- if we -- my husband was there 17 years. I™ll tell you what, I will 
know, I will think about it. Let™
s continue right now, but I w ill think about it. It™s quite 

awhile. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Because he was -- okay, he was there -- he
 was 17 years, then when he felt that he 
cannot do it any more, because of -- I mean
, he -- he knew something about himself, 
which I didn™t even noticed. He 
said he has to -- and that he has to give it up, and the -- 
because then, the treasurer, who was another 
man may b e for two years, and three years, 
so we were five, six years. Six and 17 would 
be 21, or something like that. Maybe more. I 
have a book, I could look it up, and tell you exactly. 

Q: Did you stay in that 
neighborhood for a long time? 
A: That™s a good question. I wish we did, 
but Philip was -- I mean, 
the neighborhood was 
changing, that™s for sure. But the most important thing was 
that the schools, which Philip, 
my older son, was supposed to enter was muc h  
to be desired. An in -- there was -- it was 
not a school which I would be happy th at 
he goes to, for many reasons. And I am not 
prejudiced, I really -- I mean, I™m normal, but
 the -- I respect everybo
dy. Now, so we had 
to move. So  we moved to a four units, and we
 lived in one. We boug
ht that place, and 
then I -- I was managing it, Dave was, of 
course, very busy in his office. I never 
mentioned about his office, but I will. And 
I was doing everything th
ere, and it -- I had 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
35
 
 
 
 
 
many responsibilities, and life was really not 
easy, but -- but that there was -- it was 
important. 
Q: Let™s talk about that a little bit more, abou
t the office, and what 
the kind of work was 
that -- 
A: Dave did? 
Q: Yeah, a-a-and -- 

A: No, th --  not yet, not yet. He™s not yet in the office.  
Q: Oh, okay, okay. 
A: He™s not yet in the office. Now there, I de
cided that I want to become a nutritionist. I 
have always -- I have always been interested 
in nutrition. It starte
d actually -- see my -- 
my  father had diabetes, and had a kidney st
one, and -- in the -- in the ghetto, he didn™t 
have neither diabetes, nor th e 
kidney stone. And that happene
d to  other people. However, 
we had pathologic -- these were 
pathological diseases. T h e ot
her diseases, of course, are 
typhus, edema of the legs or the whole bo
dy, due to malnutrition, epidemiological 
diseases were rampant, but these diseases we
re not. So, after the lib -- not right after the 
liberation, but approximately -- yeah, I was ac
tually conscious of it 
even when we lived 
in Bull Heights, because I wanted Philip to
 eat vegetables, and if he didn™t eat the 
vegetables, I would awf -- awfully upset. A
nd he -- but he -- while we were living on 
Kenmore, I decided that I want to go to co lle
ge, and I went to Los Angeles City College 
to become a nutritionist, and I actually en
jo yed it very mu ch. And Charlie rememb ers

waiting for me on the campus, and watching the 
trains turn around. And the -- tho -- we 
had classes in anatomy, which were very he
lpful to me, and I -- there were many students 
from the nursing department, and I was rea
lly  able sometimes ev
en to help them. 
However, in 1960, there was a change. Dave ha
d a massive, very serious heart attack, and 
I gave up college. It was so serious, that the 
doctors were trying to convince me that he 
will never survive. But w ith my optimistic o u tlook, and knowing Dave, who can 
overcome a lot, I -- I to ld them that they d
on™t dare telling me that. And this -- this was 
the same year as Presid ent Eisenhower had hi
s heart attack. And Dr. Griffiths, a famous 
cardiologist, was also in -- invited to see Dave
. When he looked at 
his file, he was very 
grim. But when he walked in and saw Dave, 
he changed his mind, a
nd he told the other 

doctors there is a 50 - 50 cha -- chance. No
w that was very important, because the 
attitude of the doctors is important. Now, Da
ve recovered. I -- maybe it is not what is 
being usually done today wh en children are c
oncerned, however, I tried to keep up th eir 
violin lessons, and I was waiting to tell them, 
and to bring them to Dave, wh en  Dave was 
able to wear a robe, and be in th e waiting room. My feeling, in my case, the children were 

young, the father was a big support to them, 
and I was very much concerned that that will 
-- it will affect them. S o , all th
e friends knew that 
they don™t dare tell anything. And it 
worked. Anyhow -- 
Q: It worked so that Dave got better? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
37
 
 
 
 
 
A: Dave recovered. It was the -- what was 
happening actually, he needed  a pacemaker, 
but the pacemaker wasn™t in -- was not yet 
invented. So, there was a certain medication 
which just came out, which he was getting, but he
 was able to work w
ith pulse of 40, and 
sometimes even 35. I don™t know
 how this guy did it. I used to feed him vitami n E, wh ich 
our friend, Dr. Horoby gave me permission to 
do so. Anyhow, when he recovered, he was 
still working in the same estab
lishment, but now he was the h
ead of the office. He had the 
mastery of the English language, and knowin
g -- and he ex -- it was explained to the 
administration what his bac
kground is, and believe me, he was work ing there for 17 
years. He was admired, and he was respected 
by -- by the see -- the 
chairman of the board 
became his friends, and other directors became
 his friends, and the people who work for 
him loved him. So he was very
 demanding, mu ch of himself, and mu ch for others. Now, 
later on -- first it was a Carr shoe store, then
 there was HRT, and on 
top of this duties in 
the office, he also became the director of 
imports. And -- but he -- 
when this possibility 
of becoming treasurer for th
e 1939 Club came upon, he gl
adly accepted it, and he was 
work ing long hours, and really 
enjoyed doing it, because he believed in that good cause. 
So we are now -- now we have to move agai
n, because Philip has to
 enter -- I mean, the 
junior high was fine, it was vigil, and it wa
s alright, and he was doing quite well there, 
but there was a very good school called Fairfa
x High School, and we wanted him to go to 
Fairfax, and we needed to be in the distri
ct. So now -- by the way, after Dave™s heart 
attack, I decided that I better have a professi
on, so I went to a real estate school, passed 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
38
 
 
 
 
 
the examination and got a real estate license. 
And I was able to find a place where we are 
now, a 16 unit, quite nice building, and the do
wn payment was low, and I figured out that 
if I had to finance -- we finance the four un
its and -- and I™ll be able to buy it. And I 
remember when Dave asked me
, ﬁHow will you buy it?ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁD ave, I will have the 
money.ﬂ And I came here, looked at it, and Da
ve only had five minutes time. He came  
from work, and left. Just -- he 
introduced himself to
 the previous owner, and I made the 
decision very quickly, and we
 bought the build ing. No w, 
we -- people were asking me, 
ﬁWeren™t you afraid?ﬂ There was 
-- at times, there were many vacancies. I said, ﬁI™m not 
afraid of hard work, and I am afraid, howe
ver, of having financials problems,ﬂ but of 
hard work -- and I worked very
, very hard. I -- there are still 
the -- many kitchens there is 
linoleum, I put -- I was putting up squares. In
 many places they still -- they™re wallpaper, 
which I put on. I learned to chan ge washers. I 
-- even today, I -- when garbage disposal is 
blocked, I can unblock 
it very well. And I still do many things, not as many things as I 
did before. Now, Dave -- I was doing everyt
hing, and -- and when  I had a vacancy, I 
didn™t even tell Dave. He was just too busy , 
and I didn™t want to 
bother him. However, he 
did the paperwork, which was ve
ry helpfu l. Well, when Dave passed -- about half a year 
before he passed away, I started doing the ac
counting, the paperwork, and Dave was so 
impressed that I can do it, and believe me, 
it was a big relief to him, because he was 
always worried, how will I be able to do it, a
nd I think that was much 
easier than to take 
care of his health. Anyhow --

Q: Estelle, let™s put -- let™s go back just a littl
e bit, because I do want to ask you, when 
did you s -- did you ever talk to your ch ild
ren about both your war experiences, and if 
you did, wh en did you start? 
A: This is a very good questio
n, and it™s easier now to  answer it, because I talked to 
Philip just recently, and I told
 him certain things from the 
camps, an d he says, ﬁDo you 
know you never talked to me about it?ﬂ And -- 
But Dave did. I think maybe he talked to -
- I -- I™m not sure. But, it depends -- the r
eaction of children is different. Now, Philip 
knew already ev erything 
from Dave, and he -- 
Q: By what age, sort of -- 

A: Young. 

Q: Young. 
A: He was -- he was fairly young. They us
ed  to take walks, they had a marvelous 
relationship. Both boys had 
very good relationship with 
Dave. And the -- so, he knew 
everything, and -- and he was angry about it.
 And he -- it influenced him, definitely. 
Q: Why -- why angry? 
A: That it happened, and also 
that God permitted it 
to happen. See, I 
never blamed God. 
Somehow I never blamed God. Maybe my  ph
ilosophy about God is different. Maybe I 
really believe that we get a certain energy, or 
we get influence, or we get guidance, but in 
my  philo sophy about God was -- is such, prob
ably, that I never blamed God for what 
happened. But anyhow -- but wa
s -- Charlie was different. Charlie figured that if we 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
40
 
 
 
 
 
could survive it, he can surv
ive everything. So, he depe
nds on the personality. Now, I 
might have talked to Ch arlie mo re. I have to
 check it with him, but he -- not really -- I 
was so busy about that they eat right, and that 
they do their homework, and that of course, 
was the [indecipherable]. It wasn™t
 the lack of time. I would ha
ve found the time to talk to 
them, but probably I didn™t feel like talking, 
and since my  husband did all the talking, 
then -- then I -- I was surprise
d when my -- when Ph
ilip just recently 
told me that I -- 
when I talked to him abou
t it, that I never talked
 to him about it. So -- 
Q: Did you -- did you ev
er go back  to Po land? 
A: No, I didn™t. I -- I couldn™t, I couldn™t see 
what happened 
in Poland. I was going to a 
school where all national holid ays were cele
brated, and the -- but we knew about an -- 
anti-Semitism, specially in the 
-- in the year before the outb
reak of the war, it was also 
the influence of that folksd eu
tschen. I mean the German who were living in Poland, and 
cus -- 

Q: Ethnic Germans. 
A: Ethnic Germans. And the -- but that -- that
 -- that would not be the -- th-that wouldn™t 
have influenced me so mu ch. I speak Polish very  well, and I finish high school in Poland, 
and I loved hearing music of Chopin, and the 
-- we were good citizen, I™m sure we were 
good citizen. Now, what influenced me? Wh
en the Germans -- it™s u nbelievable -- when 
the Nazis came into Poland, an
d the Nazis were actually th
e -- the invaders, the Nazis 
could not really differentiate on a street, wh
o is Jewish, and who is not. Bu t there were 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
41
 
 
 
 
 
Polish children, and Polish youngsters, who are 
pointing out to their invaders who is a 
Jew. Now, this is something 
which I really -- which is very
 bothersome to me. And you 
know there was -- there was one occurrence th
at when survivors ca
me back, they were 
killed by the Poles. I would still be tolerant
 of them, because we all make mistakes, 
however, there is anti-Semitism now in Poland.
 Now, of course, we left everything. I 
have property in Po land, and 
some is actually I think in 
-- in -- in my name now, but 
people who tried to -- to become owners 
of their property have
 big difficulties, b ig 
difficulty. And -- okay, we left them everything
. We left them the family jew el, we left 
them -- the store was taking aw
ay  by th e Germans. One day, th
ey came to my father, we 
had like a department store, not as big -- 

Q: Estelle, I™m sorry. I think we 
should probably stop
 here. This is the end of tape two, 
side A, interview with Estelle 
Klipp. I™ll just switch it over. 
A: Okay . 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Estelle Klipp. This is tape number two, side
 B. So we were just talk ing about why you 
did not want to go back to Po
land, and maybe you can say a 
little bit more ab
out that, but 
also then say how you feel about
 Polish people in Poland today. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
42
 
 
 
 
 
A: Okay. Believe it or not, that I actually lik
e when  I have opportunity to speak Polish. 
And recently I needed to write
 a letter to someone, and it was amazin g , I wrote it very 

well, and the trick is actually to think in Po
lish, not to think Eng
lish, and really I was 
amazed how well I did, autographically, and othe
rwise. Now, I don™t have any hate in my 
heart, amazing as it is, and I wish that Polish 
people well. I wish that they develop a good 
economy , that they have a demo cratic gove
rn ment. However, I just wish very, very 
much, that they understand that
 being anti-Semitic ac
tually doesn™t make sense, and that 
there is no reason to hate us. And it is not he
lpful to them at all.
 Now, I wish they 
followed the teaching of the pr
esent Pope, Pole, who went to  the synagogue in Rome, and 
who claims, rightly so, that act
ually the Jews contributed a lo
t to Christianity. That they 
gave Jesus, who was, of course, Jewish, to 
-- to the Christians. Now, let™s be optimistic 
again, and let™s hope that the time will come
, that maybe if their economic situation 
improves, that they will start 
thinking in these terms, so th
e tradition of anti-Semitism is 
so long, and so much imbedded in their -- a-ac
tually even the father
s in chur -- in the 
churches, that it will take some great influe
nce to change their mi
n d s, but hopefully -- 
hopefully they will, and I 
really wish them well. 

Q: So, you don™t have 
hate in your heart. 
A: No, I don™t have hate. 
Q: But it would have been too difficult for 
you psychologically, and emotionally, to go 
back? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
43
 
 
 
 
 
A: It would be like taking a wound, and opening it, and maybe even putting -- putting 
acid over it. I mean, I just always see the pict
ures, especially the picture where we arrived 
-- arrived in Auschwitz. We were lucky there 
was -- my whole family was there. I -- I see 
other pictures. I know what happened. I just 
hope -- wh ich I mentioned in my  tape, that 
the deaths of my  parents wasn™t pa -- was not pa
inful. I -- I just co uldn™t go there, I just 
could not go there. And ti -- unless, of course
, let™s say my  children would insist, I might 
have changed my mind. But fo
r myself, it will be devasta
ting, and I really need my 
health. I needed my
 health to take care of my  husband, 
I needed the health
 to -- to be the 
manager here, I need my health
 for myself. And it won™t be re
ally constructive, because if 
I would know th at I am achieving something, 
then it might influence me. But I would not 
achieve abso lutely anything. 
The property which we have
 there, I will try to do 
something about it, but the like
lihood is not very great that I would be comp ensated in 

any way. 

Q: Did you ever go to Israel? 
A: Oh, that™s a good question. We -- I am very
 much concerned about Israel. I -- we have 
the Jerusalem Post, and I -- when
 I get the Jerusalem Post, I re
ad it from the first page to 
the last. So sometimes they were already in
 the paper, which I™m getting every day, the 
Los Angeles Times, there are 
also some information. I am
 -- I™m very concerned about 
Israel, and the -- very, very 
concerned, and -- however, and so metimes really I wish, 
specially now, to be able to visit, but I 
have now -- now somebody who does it for me, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
44
 
 
 
 
 
and it is my  granddaughter Rachel, and she™s -- 
right now she is hiking in the desert, saw 
Angetti, saw the Wailing Wall, and when sh
e saw the Wailing Wall, the girl started 

crying, from emotions. So, when
 she will come back, she w
ill give me some impression 
of her own. Both my sons were 
in Israel, and visited it, and -- 
Q: Was there a special reason why you didn™t 
go? Why you never went
, the two of you? 
A: That™s a very good questio
n. Dave was really very concerned about Israel, and -- 
however, Dave, when the pa -- first pacemaker
 came out, Dr. Griffiths made the decision 
that it™s time for Dave to have it, because hi
s heart was very large,
 and the first surgery 
was actually open heart surgery,
 and th anks to my  vigilance, I notice after a few months, 

quite a short time, that he™s not well. And 
I -- I had a very  hard  time impressing it abou -- 

upon the people who had -- in the hospital, 
which was Dr. Kaper from the surgery, and it 
was the Saint Vincent Hosp ital, Dr. Kay wa
s away, there was remodeling going on. And 
finally, when I told them that 
if Dr. Kay comes back, how will 
they be able to face him if 
they don™t check on Dave? Fina
lly they did. So I and Charlie
 went with Dave there, and 
the minute they saw him, they
 took him to the operating r
oom, and at this time, they 
inserted a -- the pacemakers wh
ich are -- which are being in
serted now, which don™t -- 
don™t require open heart surgery, but it™s d
one through the arm. 
Now, Dave had the 
misfortune that anything which can go wr
ong with th e pacemaker, including a runaway 
pacemaker, where the pulse was over 200, 
happened to him. Now, he had about 10 
surgeries to change the p
acemaker, so I have to compliment the medical profession 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
45
 
 
 
 
 
because the last 12 years, the pacemaker 
lasts like eight years or more. Anyhow, 
considered all of this, I felt that it™s not sa
fe for us to go on a jour
ney. First, we were 
always afraid the pacemaker will fail, and that
™s why we did not go to see Israel, so I 
really wish, for my husband, and also for my
self, but where I am concerned, there is 
always possibilit -- a possibility that I still can  do it. 
Q: Did you, either one of you, ev er 
testify in front of turbunal -- tribunal? 
A: Yes, Dave. It is in his tape. He was te
sti -- his testimony was there -- they took the 
testimony here, and yeah, he tes
tified. And he did -- testimony 
was taken here and sent to 
Germany. 

Q: But you nev -- you 
were never asked? 
A: No, I was never asked to testify. He -- 
you know, when  he testified, they ask him 
whether he™s a lawyer, the way he testified, yeah. 

Q: Would you ha
ve done it? 
A: Of course. 
Q: Had you -- had you ever been asked? 
A: If I -- w h at -- see, h e had a tremendous memory, Dave. Of course, if I would s -- if I 

would know of some people wh om I know what
 crimes have penetrated, and if I would 
have, I definitely would testify, this my  duty. Ju
st as I feel about th is interview, that it is 
my  duty to bear witness. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
 
Q: I only ask -- I only ask that because I b
il -- I seem to rememb er from your videotape 
that you said that you wouldhave had butterflies doing it, a
nd especially testifying ab out 
the ghetto, and I just meant to
 ask you what that meant. 
A: I am very so -- you know, that™s interes
tin g. I am -- y ou know, I am following a lot of 
alternative medicine. So I really am gratef
ul, and I appreciate the regular medicine 
because -- and I want to maybe here have the 
opportunity to say tha
nks to Dr. Horlumby, 
who was our friend and doctor, a
nd helped  Dave enormously. An
d to Dr. Griffiths, and to 
Dr. Shak man, who helped Dave 
really to live a long life. However, I also added, to this 
medical approach, a -- the alternative medici
ne approach , like homeopathy, and herbs, 
and also a certain treatment by a chiropracto
r, which was very help
ful -- which was very 
helpfu l to David, and also to me. Now, Regina 
told me that I mentioned in my tape that I 
would have butterflies in my  stomach, probab
ly, if I would have 
to testify. Now, I 
became stronger through this treat
ment, and I just wanted to mention here that I realize --  
and I also go to a regular doctor, and I realize 
their contribution to  medicine. It™s only a-at 
-- a -- addition to my regular -- to my regular
 medical treatment. So, fortunately, I am 
pretty good health. Now, this treatment wh
ich I am receiving, made me stronger 
emotionally. And if this ques
tion would have been asked fro
m me today, I would have 
said I would gladly face them, a
nd I would gladly testify. It is
 my duty to do so. So, we 
grow. We never stop growing. 

Q: Well, you also just learned Sp an ish,I heard, so you definitely don™t stop --

A: Yes, yes, that™s true, you know, wher
e we™re talking about the tradition, about 
learning. I just recently learned Spanish, an
d I can communicate, and it™s a big help to 
me, and I -- I enjoy and pr
obably I™ll still learn another 
language, in the future.  
Q: Estelle, let me ask you so
mething -- well, I™m asking you something all the time, but 
it™s just when you mentioned th at your gr
an ddaughter had a very special experience, 
emotional experience in Israel. 

A: Yes. 
Q: I want to ask you first of all, h o w many
 grandchildren you have, their name s, when 
they were born, and then
 I take it from there.  
A: Okay. I™m very fortunate. I -- Philip, my olde
r son, and Ellen, his lovely wife, have a 
daughter, Roneet, of course Klipp, and she™s quite
 a girl. She just fini
sh -- she just finish, 
and got her Masters in Tessle, 
which teaching English to pe
ople with other languages. 
Right now she™s in Guatemal
a to improve her Span ish, 
and also she was teaching 
English. I will meet h er on July 29
th
, when  she™s coming back  from there, and she need s 
to go to Seattle. So, she™s quite
, quite a girl. Now, her brother, Dan Klipp, I -- is also an 
amazing guy. First, he just loves books, and 
he™s a vivid reader, just like his father. And 
he is lost in the bookstore. One time he 
called me, ﬁGrandma, I™m 
so sorry I™m so late, 
but I didn™t see the time, because I was readi
ng.ﬂ Now he™s -- he also is graduated from 
college, Evergreen College. He™s -- he master
s the language of Sp anish, o-of French. He 
speaks that -- one of the Chinese languages, a
nd he -- he keeps learni
ng, and he loves to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
 
travel. So he was already in Africa, a
nd climbed the Mount Kilimanjaro, not r -- 
naturally, not from the bottom. 
He was in Asia, he was teaching English in Korea. He 
was in Morocco, he was in
 Spain, and the -- he™s still trave
ling, and -- but he
 also realizes 
the importance of education, and he keeps l
earning, and he -- in many places where he 
visit, he -- he either teaches English, or finds
 other ways to -- to pa
y for his travels. And I 
-- I have very optimistic -- I™m 
very optimistic about his -- hi
s future, and of course he 
wants to have a family , he told me, which -- 
which I am very happy about. Now there is 
Rachel, whom I already introduced to you, because she went to Isra
el. She™s a wonderful 
girl. She takes singing lessons, and she™s -- in 
school she was the st age manager for plays. 
And she probably, an yhow, from what she shar
ed with me, she woul
d like to go in that 
direction, and -- wh en she enters college. Th
ere is another guy, wo nderful Benjamin, and 
he™s extremely smart, and I have great hope
s for his good future, specially since his 
parents are such abso lutely wonderful parents,
 and he -- her mo  -- his mo ther and my  son 
also, really have a special ab
ility to deal with children, 
and oh well, we mention my 
daughter-in-law now, Margo, she also uses 
alternative medicine, o-o-of course, when 
necessary, also the medical approach, and sh
e was -- in her search, which she is very 
good at, she found a doctor who is the MD, 
but he also uses al te
rnative medicine. So, 
when we get together, we have much to talk 
about, and she was actu
ally very helpful in 
finding some homeopathic doctor in Los Angele
s for me. Now, there are all the four, and 
I don™t expect there™ll be more
. Maybe the next generation.

Q: Let™s -- let™s talk about -- I don™t want to 
make it a question, I™ll just say let™s talk -- 
talk a little bit about 
your Jewish identity. 
A: Okay. I would like to also 
say something about -- let™s say,
 I don™t consider it such a 
big accomplishment, but this -- what -- I can 
talk first by -- about my Jewish identity. 
Now I, my family was actually Or
thodox, so my fath
er was great in mathematics, and he 
also spoke some French and 
German. But it was a rather Or
thodox house, so I was going 
to a secular school, a private gymnasium. The gymnasium named after the owner, which 
was Mrs. Hockstein, and we had only some 
Hebrew in struction, not too mu ch of it, 
unfortunately, and all the girls in school were
 Jewish. Now, my experience with Judaism 
was very positive. In the -- in our home, I wa
s told -- and I heard it quite frequently that 
not only it™s important to give, but it™s importa
nt how you give, not to make the oth -- the 
receiver uncomfortable. Every Friday night,
 from the house of prayer, my hus -- my 
father -- my father was bri
nging what was called the orech, which means a guest, and the 
guest was really treated like a guest. And 
he wasn™t asked any questions about his 
whereabouts, he was just -- there was a lot 
hospitality about how we treated him. And a 
bag with food was prepared at
 the time when he was leaving. And that was done every 
single Friday night, and also for holidays. 
So , I knew ab out sedaka. Also, wh en there was 
a family which was less fortunate that we were
, I know that they were supported. Then I 
saw a great respect for my grandparents. My 
parents respected the grandparents. Also, the 
brothers of my  mo ther not only respected 
them, but really, well, just extremely, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
50
 
 
 
 
 
extremely generous. So my -- this experi
ence was very positiv
e where Judaism is 
concerned. Then  my  father studied on Saturd
ay, he used the time to study the Talmud, 
and the -- and th en other books. And so  I hear
d [indecipherable] ma ny expression, I heard 
about Ru shy, wh ich I would lik
e to know more about right 
now. Then, in the ghetto, it 
was very interesting, because, for instance, 
for a time we were allowed to do some 
planting in the backyard , it wasn™t a big back
yard, but ev erything was helpful. And no 

one, but no one stole somebody™s 
else™s tomatoes, or whatever was growing. Then, when  
my  brother was so sick in 
the ghetto, I -- I wa
s someti me s spending the night at the 
neighbors. There was another neighbor who -- 
who to ld us about Dr. Yawkish, and she 
was extremely helpful. So, all my experiences, living among Jews, were very positive. 

So, also I am -- of course I observe holiday
s, and for an -- for th
e high holidays and Yo m 
Kippur, I am in the temple. I 
pray in my  own way, in general, and so I know th at the 
tradition is very important, let™s say when 
my  grandchildren come, because that™s how, 
actually, religion is being in troduced to ch
ildren, and it™s very, very  important. So , not 
being really observant, I am s
till very Jewish, and I -- I™m ha
ppy that I™m Jew ish, in spi -- 
in spite of what I had to suffer because of the [indecipherable] 

Q: Was it different with your husband, or di
d you -- did you ag ree on
 those -- on those -- 
A: My husband was -- he -- I -- I -- I read He
brew. For instance, when
 I am at temple, I 
can follow. I don™t understand mo st of it, but
 I can follow. My husba
nd knew prayers by 
heart. Even when he was very
, very sick, and we had Passove
r in our house, we were all 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
 
amazed, he remembered by hear
t, so many prayers. So he™s -- he really -- and he 
reme mb ered so many melodies, and so  many 
prayers. But he was a man of the -- you 
know, of the wide world. And him -- I wish, 
actually -- so, for inst
ance, for easker, which 
is a prayer for the dead, he was always in 
the temple, he always was going to the temple. 
So, actually, we were able, with our -- I-I -- ma
ybe he would have lik
ed even a little more 
observance, because like, I like 
havdallah, which is -- which is 
said at the end of Shabbat, 
to make a -- a distinction between the beginni
ng of the week, and the ending of Shabbat. 
So, I guess if I would have asked him very mu
ch, he would have done it. But otherwise, 
we -- we did not have any problems about ob
servance. And it™s -- defi
nitely was a Jewish 
home, when the children were small, there w as 
-- we st -- sta -- stuck to that observance 
more than I do right now. 
Q: It sounds as you have had a good marri
age. That you have nice children and 
grandchildren, everything. An
d a comfortable living. However, are there still memories 
that haunted you and your husband
? Was it not always that easy? 

A: It™s still not easy. I just 
-- see, my  husband passed aw ay. 
Q: When ? 
A: August second, 1997. I will go back  -- he 
was 92, and th is, I believe that he lived so 
long, considering that he had this massive he
art attack in 1960, a
nd th at he was work ing 
so hard, and so many hours, which he enjoyed, 
I feel that I have a certain contri -- that I 
made a contribution to his health
. So, it wasn™t so easy in th
e beginning to convince him, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
 
but after awhile, he admitted to my son thathe follows my instructions, especially when 
food is concerned, he does feel better. So 
he changed his way of 
eating. Then, I used 
herbs, which he -- then I juiced celery a
nd other vegetables, be
cause he would not 
otherwise eat them. I was very, very -- how ca
n -- inventive in making certain things out 
of vegetables, which he didn™t realize they 
are vegetables. And also, we were using a 
chiropractor who was extremely good, and than
ks to that, he -- he had water on the lungs 
for awhile, but thanks to this treatment, he 
actually did not have it any mo re. He did not 
have -- the water subsided. An
d so he had 10 surgeries fo
r his pacemaker, and he has 
other surgeries, each time he
 bounced back, with his iron 
will, and his equanimity, and 
went back  to wo rk, and -- and was doing
 a great job, so I, of course, was -- 
Q: I was -- I was asking about memories. 
A: Right. 
Q: [inaudible] 

A: So, the reason I answer it this way, was th
at I was so busy doing something wh ich had 
-- see, he™s the father of my
 children, he is my husband.
 He is himself. And if I can 
prolong his wi -- life, and I ca
n keep him healthy, I though
t this would be my  greatest 
achievement, and it was really, really the -- the ai
m of my life. I h ave a friend, she used to 
always say, ﬁOkay, David, but where is Es
telle?ﬂ I just -- just
 -- even un -- didn™t 
understand what she said. Now, on top of it, 
I -- I am -- I was taking care of the 16 units. 
When I had a vacancy, 
I didn™t even tell him. Now, 
since he passed away, I am the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
 
owner, I am the manager, I clean up a little bit. 
I do all the paperwork, I prepare the taxes. 
So, I am actually very busy. And I was even
 -- I was just as busy before, to a certain 
degree. And i -- so to tell you th e truth, right 
now, I -- the me mo ries haunt me mo re than 
before. Before, I was even bus
ier, probably. I have some 
memo ries . So metimes I d r eam 
that why I™m not going to our store, I would 
be very good at it. And I -- I -- one time I 
had a very  destructive dream, but I don™t have
 them too frequently . This picture of -- of 
the day in August, where we came out of th
e trains, and had to leave everything, and 
suddenly we were separated. So I didn™t kn
ow for a long time what actually happened. 
This -- this scene just lives with
 me. I live with this scene. I 
-- this -- na -- it -- it really 
never parts. Also, what haunts me was when
 they took my fath
er, and specially my 
mother to the krippo, because 
I -- it™s in my tapes, when sh
e tame -- came back, she was 
just emotionally destroyed, an
d I was happy when  they  took 
me also, so -- not that I was 
big help, but -- so this -- th
is was very traumatic. My -- 
Q: I™m sorry. We have to stop now, and use another tape. 
A: Good. 
Q: This is the end of tape two, si
de B, interview with Estelle Klipp. 
A: Thank you. 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Estelle Klipp. This is ta
pe number three, side A. And 
you were just talk ing about -- 
A: No, you don™t want to
 talk to the microphone? 
Q: It™s -- it™s all right, I can
 -- I™m -- I™m -- I can hear myse
lf, I™m -- I™m fine on tape. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Now, I just want to say, you just talked 
about two memo ries, or two images that -- that 
haunt you, and I was just wondering whether 
you had -- whether you 
want to conclude 
this with another one. 

A: Very often I think -- we had a -- it™s ment
ioned the tape, we had a cellar in our room, 
and [indecipherable] in the ghetto, and we
 were hiding there whenever there was 
deportation, pretty successfully
, and very often I think, maybe
 if we wouldn™t have gone 
to Au schwitz, maybe if we would have been  
hiding th ere, but then 
I think, where would 
we get food? And of course, we
 didn™t know, because there we
re actually graves prepared 
for the people who were designated to clean 
the ghetto. So, we di
dn™t know that the 
Russian were -- at -- Russians 
will enter so soon. Lodz, wh
ich was Litzmanshtadt, so 
even the Rukoski went 
to Auschwitz. They were so deceivi
ng, the Nazis, that they were 
able to convince us that we are going to a 
better place. Anyhow, that haunts me so very 
often, because I figured maybe -- then maybe we
 would been able to  
-- to survive. Then, I 
often see the picture of my  brother. He be
came rather -- rather religious. And in the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
55
 
 
 
 
 
ghetto he used to lay the te
fillin, which they something yo
u put on your head, and you 
wrap your arm, and he was extremely handsome. 
And, so it™s a great pain that he didn™t 
survive. Then, of course, I 
often think of my  mo ther, she was an exceptional woman, 
never complained either. And -- and w-wh ich 
other memories? Course I remember, yeah, 
there was -- but that is in my tape, this -- 
when we were walking w
ith this wooden shoes, 
and the -- it was the -- ice was growing under 
our shoes, and they  did not permit us to 
stop and clear it, and I also -- also  it was ve
ry often on my  mind, there was one Mrs. 
Cohen. She was a mo ther of a girl maybe a lit
tle bit younger than me. She was very often 
whipped and punished, and -- but, going back 
to the alternative medicine, in connection 
even with  that, and to th e yoga, wh ich I practi
ce religiously every day, and I feel that I 

can stretch better, really, as time progresses.
 I became stronger, emotionally. So, when 
these me mories come, I still could realize that
 I cannot allow them to take over, because 
there is still so much I have
 to do right now. And the -- 
for instance, I learned yoga 
actually, when I was quite young, from Indra 
Davy, and she was from 
India. And th en fo r 
about 20 years, I couldn™t do it, because I 
had a pain in my  back , lower back, which 
didn™t nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong sh ow
ed up on MRI, but I had this pain . No w, 
when my chiropractor learne
d to do -- she used to help
ed me, but it was coming back . 
Then  she learned a certain method, which is 
developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein 
from New York , wh ich was called networking, wh
ich is actually they just touch certain 
points, and miraculously, it s
ounds strange, but I™ll tell you anyhow about it. One time, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
56
 
 
 
 
 
short -- ma ybe two weeks after she was practic
ing it with me -- on me, my arm started -- 
started moving in yoga
 positions. And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it™s 
getting better, and better, but I do 
not have the problem with my
 back now, and I started 
doing yoga. And actually my  y
oga is improving as I -- I do
n™t know whether I mentioned 
it before. And I can do -- I can stretch bette
r as the time progresses, and it gives me 
awfully good feeling. Besides that, there ar
e seven postures, special l y  the ones which 
stretch the neck, wh ich have a big, relaxing 
influence over the emotions. And I guess also 
the nutrition which I practice. Now, there 
is s -- something called he -- hemio -- 
hemiopathy -- homeopathy. And it was actually 
discovered in Germany, about more than 
200 years a go. And these remedies are also 
very helpful. Now, in order to know which 
vitamin is good for us, which is
 not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a me thod used by 
chiropractors, and also other practitioners of
 alternative medicine, called muscle testing. 
The people who do it are kinesthiologists. 
That™s how they call themself. Now, one 

chiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w 
-- I™m trying to teach others, but I don™t 
know why, I am not successful. I only was able
 to teach my  grandson. He just was so 
impressed, because the idea of 
this muscle testing is such
. If we put into our bodies, 
whether it™s a [indecipherable] vitamin or food
, wh ich is good for us, it strengthens our 
mu scles. And th e opposite if it™s not good fo
r us, it weakens our muscles. So, the method 
is, after the certain, let™s say food or vitamin,
 is put on the body, usually close to the 
simu s, which is on the chest, and one ch ec
ks the arm by having th e arm extended, and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
57
 
 
 
 
 
trying to push it down. If the remedy is not 
good for the body, th
e arm will go down. If 
it™s good for the body, it won™t go. And the same
 can be used with the fingers, which I -- 
which I use, and I™m pretty accurate at it. 
Now this was helping me
 very much with my 
husband, because I was able to determine whet
her things are good for him or not, and it™s 
a great help to me, because I am able to resi
st what is not good for me, since I know it. 
Now, I know of a doctor who used to be a 
doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and 
he -- he is now doing alternative medicine, 
and he uses -- he has a machine wh ich he 
uses, but wh ere I went to him one time, and I 
show him that I can do mu scle testing, he 
says, ﬁYou don™t need  to come to
 me any mo re.ﬂ And I don™t.  
Q: So you are still trying to, or
 you are still g rowing, all the time? N o t just stretching, but 
-- 
A: Yes, and so -- that was extremely helpfu l because it was very important to help my  
husband in all ways -- I mean, in all possibly 
ways, so that he could live long. And the -- 

I -- it just -- I spoke to my  c
ousin, he™s in Australia, I me an, 
actually his son, he says, do 
you know -- and that was maybe
 in ™85 or so, ﬁDo you remember -- now he™s doing so 
well, and do you remember how it was in -- 
in 1970 when I talked  to you, how worried 
you were about him?ﬂ So I™m very -- so he™s
 not here, but he had a good life, and we 

keeped  him healthy, and the -- I don™t want to 
give myself more credit than I deserve, but 
I hear from all kinds of quarters, friends, doct
ors and others, that I was quite helpful in 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
58
 
 
 
 
 
keeping him healthy. Now, wh
at would you like me to a -- 
what would you like to ask 
me? 
Q: I would -- you could see in my
 face I have another question. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Well, something slightly  different. We
 did talk about your Jewish identity. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Before. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you remember 
when you began to feel comfor
table with an identity as an 
American? Assuming that -- that -- 

A: Yes, yes, yes, I feel very -- 
Q: -- and what -- and what [indecipherable] 
A: -- okay, I will tell y ou what -- I will tell 
you what. That I first -- I™m really very 

grateful to the United States for giving me 
the opportunity, and givi
ng me my citizenship, 
and I think it™s an absolutely 
great country. I mean, great co
untry. And I am very mu ch 
interested in politics. 
When the children were 
small, an d Adlai Stev
enson was running for 
president, I took them to th
e Roosevelt Hotel, and to the 
rally, and we were cheering him 
up. Then, I have a picture, I will show it to 
you, with Senator Scoo
p Jackson, and the -- 
which wa -- it was my  husband and my self, and 
I™m very proud of it,
 and I™m very, very 
sorry that he passed away so 
soon, and so unexpectedly . I wish -- I shouldn™t say it, but I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
59
 
 
 
 
 
wish I instructed him in health
y living, but I didn™t have a chance. And -- and he put -- he 
put -- on his ice cream, he put cream. Of course, many people do it, and live a long life, 
but I really wish he lived lo
nger. An absolutely 
marvelous senator, a marvelo u s man. I 
vote all the -- I don™t miss any possibility of vo ting, I always vote. Of course, I follow 
what™s happening with great interest. 
Q: Do you -- are more inclined
 to one party than another? 
You mentioned Steven son, so I 
gather -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: But -- 

A: Yes. However, I also admired Gold water 
-- Goldwasser, because I thought there was a 
lot of integrity, and there are some Repub
licans which I really admire, so you never 
know. It depends who the candidate will be, be
cause I actually would vote according o-of 

the qualities of the candidate 
as I see them. And so -- 
Q: Now you -- so you have said 
that you™re very grateful a
nd proud to be here, and that 
you do -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- feel A merican. 

A: I feel American, I do. 
Q: What -- what does that
 mean? C-Can you say the -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
60
 
 
 
 
 
A: What I -- what does it 
me an? Consid ering that they
 opened the gates for us, 
considering all the law s -- laws. C onsidering th
at people -- I mean, I went to Washington, 
of course, I went to -- I saw the -- the Hous
e of Representative. 
I -- I talked to my 
senators. We also -- we -- we visited the Pe
ntagon, I mean from the outside, and it was a 
wonderful experience, I wouldn™t miss it for -- not for -- I wouldn
™t miss it, that™s all. And 
the -- I™m concerned about our 
elected officials. You just 
-- I respect the president no 
matter whether he™s a Republican, or whether 
he™s a Democrat, when he™s our president, 
he™s our president. I feel comfortable here, bu
t I also realize that -- that -- that Democracy 
is something which has to be constantly wa
tched. And I remember the time of melcar -- 
McCarthy™s. So I realized at that time that --
 that it™s a witch hunt. I did realize at that 
time, and I was very happy wh en it was over. 
I worry when there is a war, of course. I 
worry about the soldiers, I re
spect the veterans. Oh, it™s a 
great country to live in, and 
God bless America. 

Q: Now it™s almo st heresy to ask you 
whether there is something that you find 
worrisome, or did you see something th at 
you find difficult? You mentioned McCarthy, 
that was -- the McCarthy era, that was -- 
you -- you were critical when you saw that. 
Were there other incidents, or [indecipherable] 

A: There is always -- there is always room to
 improvement. Even  to just take care of the 
family, there are many problems, which you 
have to overcome. Now, if you have a 
business, there are many problems. There are 
different people you have to deal with, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
61
 
 
 
 
 
whom you have to in struct, or who do better, 
or do wo rse. Now imagine a country of the 
size of the United States of America. Of c
ourse there are problems. Of course, but y -- 
there being wor-worked at. I am concerned 
ab out education. I was -- I wasn™t happy 
when  arts have been taken away  from school
s, and now it™s a tendency to put them back 
into schools, which I am very happy ab out.
 I am concerned about the environment. And 

the -- it™s a fine line between business and envi
ronment. I am very happy to see what the 
difference in the -- in the attit
ude towards tobacco, when in 
the beginning all the actresses 
were smoking, and -- to be able, I™ll tell you, it™
s such a great achievem
ent, to be able to 
come to the point now where th
ere is no advertising on televi
sion, and all the advertising 
used to be for tobacco
, for cigarettes. I think that is 
enormous achievement. There are 
many enormous achievements. And ev en in  the 
race relations. So it™s not perfect, but the 
achievements are absolutely great. So I ha
ve great hopes that the -- the country will 
flourish in all respects, and I 
think the education will also improve, because they are now. 
And if I can help in  any way, I™ll be very great to do it. 

Q: That™s a positive outlook again. Is 
there -- do you speak 
often -- do you give 
interviews or public talks ab
out -- about where you come from 
often, or is it an -- a rare 
thing? 
A: On th e Bar Mitzvah of my  granddau gh
ter, I had to get up and thank people for 
something, and they told
 me that I am pretty good public
 speaker. I mean, I didn™t have to 
say too mu  -- and I probably , if I have to ge
t up and talk, I would be able to. However, I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
 
didn™t do much of it. I have a friend, Celin
e Drack, who goes to schools, who speaks, and 
receives many letters, she is very goo -- letters. 
She is very good at it. She also went to 
prison and talked to the prisoners. And she™
s also involved in 
An ti-Defamation League, 
and in th e club, and so on, and I admire her 
for it, and it™s a very worthwhile endeavor. I 
was never -- there are many -- she also is th
e head of a teacher™s
 group. She teaches 
teachers how to teach 
Holocaust in schools. I have 
a better opinion about myself now 
than I used to, I think. And 
-- and if there would be really
 a need for me to speak -- I 
would do some studying, of course, because it™
s nice to -- you know, it™s nice to be able 
to answer many questions wh ich the students 
have. But it™s a very worthwhile endeavor, 
because if you meet a surviv
or, and you hear him talk, 
it has a good influence. 
Q: You know, I was just about 
to ask you, h-h-how do you th
ink the impact of survivor 
testimony has been on -- on -- in understanding 
of the Holocaust, in general? Tell me, do 
you have any -- 

A: We are very fortunate, very fortunate, that
 after the hiatus of time, when people didn™t 
dare -- people didn™t want to know, and ther
e were so many deniers of the Holocaust, that 
after this time, thanks to the TV, and than
ks to the movies, we became -- it became 
public. Not everybody s-still knows about it,
 but many people do, and it™s a big relief for 

the surviv ors. Anyhow, I feel 
this way, because you know, in
 our home, was a saying th at 
the worst curse actually in ou
r home was mishamime visacrone. And I didn™t know wh at 
it means. It means erase fro
m me mo ry . So  bein g  erased 
from memory, ev
en you know, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
 
there were no many -- many curses in my ho-
home, where -- with my parents, but even 
about Hitler, they say -- they say he should be
 erased from memory. 
So this poin ts how 
important it is, that the people who peri
shed should be reme
mbered. I mean, it™s 
mindboggling, it™s -- because if you say six m
illion, you cannot imagine it, but if you talk 
about a few, like Anne Frank, or others, then 
you could realize it. Now,
 I very grateful for 
-- for it being now recognized, and taught, th
at™s why I really commend Dr. S-Sam Goetz 
for establishing this chair of Holocaust studies
, and I hope -- and I have a feeling that the 
deniers of the ho -- of the Holocaust, are qui
eting down , cause we don™t hear so mu ch 
about them. 
Q: I™m just curious [indecipherable] are you fo
llowing sort, of some of the controversies 
around Holo caust studies? I mean some peop
le would say that the discussion there has 
become very , very academic, and is taking 
away from the -- from th
e human experience 
in that way. Or that too much emphasis is 
being put on -- on -- on -- on th e Ho locaust, as 
over against other aspects of 
Jewish culture. How do you -- 
A: They say if you forg et history, it repeats 
itself. So, a base of this, it™s very important 
not to fo rget. I don™t think it™s too mu ch, I do not think it™s too mu ch, because it™s -- it™s 

like Wiesel, the -- who got a Nobel prize, says
, you have to talk about it. I mean, because 

otherwise it will repeat itself. 
It™s not only for the Jewish pe
ople, it™s for -- for the world. 
In order that something like that can happen.
 So , it didn™t happen overnight, the signs 
were there. But we have to learn to watch fo
r the signs, and to  do ab -- something about it 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
64
 
 
 
 
 
before it becomes a Holocaust. So, it™s not egois
tic in any way, to talk about it. And there 
will be different aspect of the Holo caust, but 
all aspects should be 
as -- should be talked 
about it, because we are dyi
ng out. There will be no -- I mean, I can see among our 
friends, I looked at the telephone book, and 
it™s amazing how many pe
ople already passed 
away. No w, once we passed away, if we don™t 
leave the legacy, because as mu ch as you 
talk, you don™t cover everything.
 It™s impossible. So, for the 
benefit of mankind, not only 
of the Jewish people, it™s important to stud
y it, and to know wh at it happen, because I 
don™t think there were prog -- pogroms, othe
r people were persecuted, but the dimension 
of this persecution, and the pl
anning of the Final Solu tion, is
 actually, in a way unique. I 
wish it isn™t -- it wasn™t. 
Q: Do you think the world is
 learning from what can be 
learned from the Holo caust? 
A: You know, when  I think about Koso vo, th
is is the first time 
-- I mean, nothing is 
perfect, but considering wh at Milosevitch 
was doing to these people, he was burying 
them, he was murdering them. And I -- and it™s 
fortunate that NATO, with the baking of -
- backing of the United State, had the gut
s to do so mething ab out it, and I am not 
qualified to say it, but there is likely a like
lihood, that the Holoca
ust of the -- of the 
people during World War Two, had some infl
uence of -- of this engagement. So we 
won™t eradicate hatred, but we might 
work towards eradication of hatred. 
Q: You did say just a -- just about two minut
es ago, that Holo caust survivors are passing 
away. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
65
 
 
 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: That™s tr ue, but on the phon
e when we talked be
fore I came here, you also said that 
you -- you referred to a spirit of the surv
ivors, when you go to gatherings -- 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Maybe you could -- 
A: Meanin -- well, the question is why cert
ain people survived. May -- maybe some of 

the answer is to see them gath
ered together. We have this 
1939 Club, who does a lot of 
charitable work, but we also gather toge
ther, and we combine some worthwhile 
endeavors with a  dance. And I actually -- 
it boggles my mind to 
see the e-enthusiasm, 
and the way these people dan
ce. Everybody dances. People 
who don™t feel good, dance. 
Everybody dances, and I never 
saw anything like it, even be
tween mu ch younger people. 
So there is something special a
bout the spirit of the survivors. 
Q: When  y-you also said a little earlier that 
you don™t speak publicly, you™re not the kind 
to talk publicly very much. But, you -- you
 thought it was very important to do this 
interview. 

A: Yes, definitely. I said once
 that I™m -- I didn™t feel guilty
 that I survive. But I would 
feel very guilty if I would not make the video when I had a chance. I would feel very 

guilty if I would not make this interview. So
 I thought maybe other 
people have more to 
say, but even if other people have mo re to 
say, what I have to say could be -- it™s also 
history. So , I have the oblig a
tion, and I™m going to  -- I have some pictures of my family 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
66
 
 
 
 
 
which were saved by somebody who came 
from Russia, and I™m 
going to  go to the 
Holocaust office, which is in Los Angeles. 
I had it all prepared. And I™m going to get a 
little bit more involved, too, so that the me
mo ry of -- of the people like -- the photos 
which I have, what I know ab out it, and ma
ybe I could mention here I appreciate the 
opportunity about my  husband™s brother, beca
use that was something which he was so 
hurt and sad about. He was -- he went to Kovn
o, his brother So lomon, and -- in the hope 
to go to the United States. A
nd in Kovno, what was happen
ing, it was under the Russian 
occupation, and then  under -- under German 
occupation. Finally, wh en the Nazis won, 
they just murdered 
him. I mean, not only him, there 
was a Mr. Frumkin, who was, I 
understand, also mu rdered. And this Solomon 
had such  potentials. He spoke a beautiful 
English, and there was a English club, and wh
en the speaker didn™t come, he spoke. And 
there was such a pain  for David, my  husband
, his whole life, that his brother didn™t 
survive.

Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Estelle Klipp. This is ta
pe number three, side B. And I 
think I would ju st like you to 
speak a little bit more ab
out your family. Whatever it is th
at you would like to add. Your 
children, your -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
67
 
 
 
 
 
A: Now, you also asked me, when 
I look back  at all this years -- 
Q: That™s the -- that™s the next question. 
A: Ah, can we reverse it? 

Q: [indecipherable] you can reverse it. So, th
e question would be wh en -- I do what you 
tell me to.  

A: How nice, thank you very  mu ch, Regina. 

Q: You never wait for [indecipherable] 
A: You are a very lovely interpre -- interviewer. 
Q: Okay, well, thank you very much. I-I™m blus
hing. But let me get 
-- let me get to the 
question. So  the question would be then, wh en
 you look back at your life, of -- of 55 
years, of the last 55 years, your life here in America, what -- how would you t -- how 
would you speak about it?
 How would you -- how wo
uld you describe it? 
A: It™s a very interesting qu
estion, and a few days ago I said, you know, since liberation, 
there™s actually -- it was 1945, so are -- 55 years, right? So there are 55 years. I have to 

talk about 55 years. And -- but it doesn™t seem
 so lo -- it wasn™t easy. It was not easy. 
Now, the reason -- one of the reason it wasn™t
 easy was that my husband so -- he was 
always active, and had a lot of energy. His 
mind was fantastic, even nearly to the very 
last minute, so he was at home. And I am ve
ry proud and happy about it, that I kept him 
at home til the last minute. And I was present at
 his death, and I could tell that there was a 
-- his body was like a shell, but he still was there.
 And then, since we liv
ed so long in this 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
68
 
 
 
 
 
apartment, I just feel h is pres
ence, and I told him 
about this interview, and I -- believe it 
or not, I still pray for him, that
 wherever he is, he™s -- he™s at
 peace, and that everything is 
alright. So there was always a feeling, even
 when I was at home, there was always a 
feeling of responsibility. And so the life 
was not easy. However, it helped me -- oh, 
especially in -- in the later years, it help
ed me. Yoga, nutrition, homeopathy, herbs, all 
these helped me to feel healthy, be healthy,
 and being able to function in  spite of the 
memories, and in sp ite of whatever difficu
lties I have to face. However, it wa -- a big 
aspect -- I was very fortunate
 with the children. They were good students, they didn™t 
give me any trouble. I don™t -- when I didn
™t have a car, we used to go with the bus, 
everywhere, and I didn™t have any problems
. I understand they 
were fighting very  
frequently in the house, but that™s -- that™s 
normal. Now, for instance, Philip is very 
bright. I mentioned, I guess before, that he we
nt to UCLA while stil
l at Fairfax High. And 
he is the avid reader, he always learns. He
 speaks perfect Hebrew, and perfect Span ish, 
and he also speaks ma n -- not speaks, but he
 knows many computer languages. And he™s 
also very good at composi
ng software. That™s something wh ich is very mu ch  sought 
after, and the -- and he happens to be extremely 
good at it. Now, I was also fortunate in -- 
he just, this year, he was celebrating his 30
th
 weddings anniversary. He has a very lovely 
wife. She has teacher™s creden
tials. She™s extremely talen ted. There is a picture here, I 
will show it to Regina, which 
she painted. It was a desk at
 -- at UCLA, dormitory of my 
son, with  all his books, and she printed the 
Hebrew text, which is -- you can see when  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
69
 
 
 
 
 
you look at the picture. She also can work 
with wo od, she can do gardening. I don™t know 
whether there is anything th is girl cannot do. 
And then, in nine -- th
en, I told you about 
the birth of Charlie in 1951, and ha -- he 
has very much my hus
band™s personality, and 
when I -- it was -- I™m really gr
ateful, these two boys is like 
a great gift to me, and their 
wives also. And Ch arlie was celebrating his 20
th
 weddin gs anniversary, and th e -- during 
the Olympics, he was associated with ABC, a
nd he was the directors of systems, and he, 
with others, devised a systems for the payro
ll, and other things, a
nd his name was on the 
credits, on television, after the Olym -- when 
the credits were shown. He -- he also has 
this personality that people like to work for him, and the people who are working for him 

-- and it was very strenuous work, told him th
at whenever he wants 
to, they will always 
work for him. His wife has al
so teacher™s credentials, and al
so, as I mentioned before, she 
also is interested in alterna
tive me dicine. I mentioned that, and she is a wonderful mo ther, 
and so I have actually two sons, 
and tw o very wo nderful girls. 

Q: I -- I forgot whether I asked you that before
, but in the case I haven™t, I just want to 
know, what about Jewish traditio
n, and Jewish faith, is that perpetuated in them, in both 
families? 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Charlie, Friday night, 
there is time to be at home, and there are no 
other arrangements being made, and th ere is 
-- there™s S h abbat dinner with the challah, 
and with candles being lit, and with the pray
ers, and all the childre
n know the prayers, 
and they  go to the synagogue, they [indeciph
erable] theyliv
e in Sebastapal, in northern 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
70
 
 
 
 
 
California. They used to live in Los Angeles,
 but they  found there 
a very good place for 
the children to go to religious school, and 
they are practicing -- they are definitely 
practicing Judaism, and the -- Rachel was very an
xious to go to Israel, she went to Israel 
in a group called Young Judea, which is unde
r the ausp ices of the Hadassah. And so -- 
Q: Did you talk to your grandchild ren a
bout -- do they know about your experience 
[indecipherable] 
A: Yes, they definitely kn
ow. They -- they know, and th
ey -- I have a little tag, it™s 
actually a tin tag with a number, there™s two 
or three -- I™ll have to look for the other 

numbers. And when  my  gran ddaughter saw this
 tag, she says, ﬁPlease don™t give it to 
anybody, I want to have it.ﬂ A
nd what was happening, they ha
d a play of Anne Frank in  
her school. And that reminds me, I was being as
ked by Regina wh ether I ever spoke. I did 
speak. Wh at happened, I was visiting Sebast
apal, and the -- my  granddaughter Rachel 
asked me whether I would talk to th e cast. 
And I s -- I was hesitating, but she says she 
knows there is another grandfather, but his E
nglish is not good, so I said, ﬁOkay, I will 
speak.ﬂ You should see the letters I got from th
at cast. It changed their complete attitude. 
They  -- they  was -- it inspired th em to play 
better, or maybe little bit different. I spoke fo r 
quite awhile, and I wa -- 

Q: What did you talk about? 
A: About my experiences, and also, you see, 
I have a uncle in Poland, who perished. He 
was taken from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, and st
rangely enough, my mo ther had at that 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
71
 
 
 
 
 
time a dream, that she is meeting him in a 
awful place. And so  I told them about my 
uncle, who came from the same tim
e -- from the same to wn as
 Anne Frank. And I kept 
talking, and they listened, 
and you know what they did?
 The program had -- had a line 
that they are -- that -- in my honor -- the pr
ogram is in my honor. And then, when I was 
there, when the play, at the last act, I was 
called to the stage, and I was given flowers. 
And I embraced, of course, everyone in the ca
st. So I did talk, and it was -- it was very, 
very easy for me to talk, now,
 because I -- cause I had a w
onderful audience, and I could 
make the connection between -- you know, betw
een Anne Frank, and my  -- and my  uncle 
in Amsterdam, and also I told them about, that
 even the father of Anne Frank, after the 
war, he married. See, they were young people,
 you have to give them hope. You cannot -- 
you cannot devastate them. So I told them th
at I™m no hating anybody, which is true, I 
wouldn™t have said it otherwise. But I also 
told them that AnneFrank™s father married 
again, and has a family. So, I 
think was important for me to 
tell them that. So -- but this 
play could have been played on Broadway . It
 was done so wonderful, and I -- I will show 
you later, I had letters and lette
rs thanking me for talking 
to them. Because
 then they 
understood what -- what 
the play is all about. 
Q: You had tears in  your eyes when 
you s -- when you talked about it, why? 
A: Because it was very touching. It
™s difficult to talk about it. It
™s difficult to talk about it, 
but I see all these young people sitting in front
 of me, an d attentively listening to me. I -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059
 
 
72
 
 
 
 
 
what a gift to me, that -- that I could talk
 about it, and they were -- they were so 
impressed, and they were so, so, 
so grateful. And so, I did talk. 
Q: Well, I have asked you pre
tty much everything that I -- 
A: Oh, you asked me -- 
Q: -- wanted for -- what? 
A: -- the second question was, wh
en I look back at my life. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I™m gra -- I am grateful to be alive. I try 
always to find somethin
g to be grateful for. 
So, I am grateful that we were able to bring 
up th e boys so well, that we gave them mu sic 
lessons, that we -- may b e we were fortunate al
so that they did so well, and are doing so 
well. And my greatest achievement is that Da
ve lived to be 95, and quite happy. Happy 
with wh at he was doing, happy with his fami
ly. And so i-it wasn™t an easy life fo r my, 
you know, because I remember
 that when others went 
to swimming pool -- to the 
swimming pool, or on a weekend,
 I was watering the -- the patio, so -- to cool it off. I 
always had the responsibilities, there were al
ways some kind of a problems which I had 
to solve, but I really -- so it 
wasn™t easy, but I didn™t mind it, because I -- I always felt 
that I rather work hard
, than have problems which I woul
dn™t be able to solve. So, thank 
you very much for interv
iewing me. It was a real gift to 
me, and a gift to my family who 
perished. Thank you. 

Q: Thank you very much, Estelle.
