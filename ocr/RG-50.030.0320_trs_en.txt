IRENE H IZME a n d RENÉ SLOTKIN 
April 24, 1995

Q: Let's start with where you were born and your
 name s at birth and now.  Let's start with 

you Irene. 

 

I: I was born in Teplice Sanov in Czechoslovakia in the year 1937, and I was name d Re nate 

Guttmann, a nd I'm now Irene Hizme.  

 

Q: Now what was the date? 

 

I: 1937. 

 

Q: No, the month? 

 

I: Sorry, December 21. 

 

R: I was born at the same  time, half hour later.  My name  then was René Guttmann and 

today is René Slotkin. 

 

01:01:57 

 

Q: Now you we re very young during these 
early years of the Nazi oppression and 
persecution, but I really w
ould like to see what it is that you reme mber as far back as you can go.  
Do you remember those first few years where?  
 You were born in Teplice Sanov, but you didn't 
live there for very long? 
 

I: No.  We  moved to Prague
 and were there for a while. 
 

R: My earliest me mories of being alive go to 
that apartment building in Prague.  It was 
ma ybe a like five or six story building brick with
 a yard and a fence.  I remember a staircase 
leading up to our apartment so we had to be some where up. 

 

I: Yeah, I think we were on the upper fl oor. 

 

R: Upper floors, and I do reme mber falling once 
and I have an injury here, which I haven't 
thought about in a long time , but I must have st
itches underneath my chin.  I still reme mber the 
burning sensation of what I guess was iodine, was 
the first aid that I got for that.  But I do 
reme mber that apartment building.  Those are my earliest, very earliest me mories, my first 

me mo r i e s .

I: I reme mber the inside a little
 bit.  I reme mber that our cr
ib was kind of on a diagonal, it 
seemed to me, it was like one room.  The kitchen 
was like down there, but we were like in the 
front where we could look out the wi ndow.  Do you reme mb er that? 
 

R: No. 

 

I: And there was a bed for our pa
rent s also in that room.  We 
were all in this one room kind 
of apartment. 

 

R: I do reme mb er a terrace. 

 

I: And a terrace, yes. 

 

R: The terrace I reme mber becau
se one stormy day there were like leaves, the wind, the 

leaves going by and I reme mber things falling do
wn from tha t .  As a ma tter of fact, your doll 
once went over. 

 

I: Right.  I had a doll and Re né threw her down off t he terrace and smashed my doll.  I 

reme mber that, too. 

 

R: Those are our first, I thi
nk, those are my first me mories. 
 

I: Yes,prettymuch. 

 

Q: You slept in the same crib? 

 
01:04:22 
 

R: I don't reme mber doing that. 

 

I: Either in the same  crib or right next or
 our cribs were like to
uching.  My recollection 
really is, and I know I've told 
you this once before, that our moth
er, when she would put us to 
sleep she pl ayed a game  with us, there was a 
game.  She would set our hands and we always 
wanted our bodies to be set a cert
ain way to see if we could stay 
that way all night long and wake 
up in that same  position.  So I reme mber that. 

 

R: This is incredible.  I'm learning this.  I never heard this. 

 

I: I reme mber that, yes. 

 

Q: Did she ma ke up this game  or did you ma ke it up? 

 

I: I'm not sure. 

 

R: I would think it had to be 
her, but that's  interesting.

Q: What other recollections?   Do you reme mb
er playing outside?   Do you reme mber the 
people around you? 
 

I: I don't reme mber the people around us so mu
ch, but I know that once René Š there was 
a yard in front with grass and René was out 
there playing.  I think 
he stepped on a bumblebee 
and he got bitten a
nd I think that was Š 
 

R: That was a big impression ma de on me .  As
 a matter fact, I had itc
hes underneath on that 
foot even when I came to the States, which was 
in 1950.  I always get an itch on the one, but I 
could never understand.  But I do reme mber that
 incident.  I put it together.  I don't know 
whether it's a real physiological phenome na or just
 my mi nd playingtricks 
on me.  But, yeah.  I 
reme mber the grass. 

 

I: You know, I also reme mber, do you reme mber
 that we had like conductor outfits and 
punching tickets to go on the train and we
 used to play train, train conductors? 
 

R: Well, that brings to mi nd, I think there 
was a tram or some thing that ran near us. 
 

I: In front of the house. 

 

R: Number22. 

 

I: Twenty-two,right. 

 

R: I wouldn't know it was 22 until now, but it l
ooked like two twos, so now we know it's a 
22. 
 
I: That was one of our favorite game s.  I thi
nk we also Š I reme mber we had some  kind of 
car that we could sit in and driv
e.  I don't Š we used to race, 
but you used to beat me all the 
time. 

 

R: See, she's older, obviously Šshe reme mbers these things. 

 

I: I reme mber one particular time we used to
 go Š our parents took us to the park.  There 
was a park nearby.  And we used to go quite a b
it, but the one time that I reme mber especially 
was right after a major storm and a lot of trees
 had fallen and we were walking on the logs, 

trying to balance, and I thinkŠ 

 

R: That must be the same storm that I'm ta
lking about except I saw it from upstairs.  We 
must have gone down. 

 

I: I think we we nt down.  I reme mber that, there's some thing about the air.  You know you 

how sometimes that smell Š it br
ings it back, even today, some tim
es I'm out and I get a certain 
smell and it says Š that's the park.  Also, I reme
mber that we  had Š I'm not sure whether it was 
trucks or what, but some  kind of toys that we 
could pull, like little wooden some thing.  And we 
also had wooden little blocks
, tiny little blocks, and you 
were very good at ma king.

R: Iwas? 

 

I: Yeah, mi ne always fell, but yours we re good. 

 

R: I don't reme mber this. 

 

01:08:58 

 

I: I do.  I also reme mber some  of our clot
hing.  In the winter we  had these nubby jackets 
like maybe made from lambs ' wool or something. 
They'r e like curly.  I don't know what it was, 
and, then on top of that, we had these harnesses 
with bells so you could hear us jingle and I guess 
that was a good way to keep track of us.  
Our Mom must have held on to us that way. 
 

R: Yes, that I reme mber, the bells. 

 

Q: Do you remember your parents? 

 

R: I don't, I really don't.  I've tried and even 
I've had visual aids since, I've gotten some  
pictures of them, but it still doesn't  seem to help. 
 I've tried to really.  
There's just one mome nt 
that I reme mber that  happened much later with my
 mo m that I reme mber, but not at that point in 
time. 

 

I: I think I'm pretty Š I coul
d not, if I didn't have photographs, I don't think I could recall 

what they looked like.  The only thing I reme mb
er is my mo m's presence at certain times.  I 
recall them vividly.  And also, my 
dad in Š one of the things that I vividly do reme mber is when 
he was taken away, and I think it 
was at night and some
 men came in uniform and they just took 
him away and, you know, we never saw him again 
after that, not to my recollection.  Although, 
René, you've said you reme mber us visiting him in prison, but I don't remember. 

 

R: I don't know. 

 

I: No? 

 

R: We didn't see him then.   

 

I: I don't reme mber seeing him.  

 

R: I reme mber going to what I Š assumi ng was 
some  kind of Š it was a huge building.  To 
me , any building was Š it was very powerful looki
ng, as opposed to the ot
her buildings and we 
would bring Š my mother and I 
would bring, we Š we would bri
ng packages there.  So, ma ybe. 
 

 

I: So ma ybe Šbut I don't... 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
5 
 
R: So ma ybe it was, now that I'm a few years 
older, it could have b
een a post office too, but 
that's not the feeling I had.  The feeling was th
at he was there, or this is where we ma de 
connection with him.  
 

I: But you're right, it could have been a post 
office and perhaps she was sending things to 
Germany. 

 

R: Orwherever. 

 

I: Orwherever. 

 

R: Wherever he  was. 

 

I: Right. 

 

Q: Do you remember seeing soldiers in the 
street?   Did you remember some thing that 
changed in Prague prior 
to your dad being taken? 
 

01:11:53 

 

I: I don't think I reme mber anything changing, but
 I think there was a feeling.  I reme mb er 
having to wa it, standing on lines.  I don't know whet
her this is a later oc
currence or fr om that 
time, but I just reme mb er having to stand on li
nes.  It could be, I don't know from where. 
 

Q: Forfood? 

 
I: Maybe, ma ybe, I'm not Š yes, ma ybe that's what it was. 
 

Q: Do you remember any change?   I know 
that you don't re me mber your mo ther in the 
visual sense, but do you reme mber a change in
 the household some how aft e r your father was 
taken or was it not that clear? 

 

I: I don't think it was that clear. 
 I have a feeling my  mo m didn
't  say anything to us and I 
think that we probably felt ou
r dad was going to come back. 
 

R: Yeah.  I don't think there was any change.  The time  just me lted. 

 

Q: You were about what, 
four years old in here? 

 

I: Yes. 

 

R: Four. 

 

Q: So that's about 1941, ma ybe '42?  

 

R: No,no.

I: Well, we know now, we just f
ound out that he actually died. 
 

R: Three weeks ago. 

 

I: We just found out three weeks a
go from the Chronicles of Auschwitz
1
 that he actually 
was executed December 18, 1941. 

 

R: It's in there.  The name , a number. 

 

I: So Š the soldiers must have come .  I do re
me mb er it was winter, so it must have been 
about a month or two before. 

 

Q: What is the next kinds of recollectio
n that you have?   Going to Theresienstadt? 
 

01:13:55 

 

I: My next recollection is 
truthfully being on a train. 

 

R: Beingthere. 

 

I: No. I reme mber a train. 

 

R: You got an earlier Š.  I 
just reme mber being there. 
 

I: And it seemed like a normal train.  It was a 
train ride and then we
 were someplace else 
and I guess that was Theresienstadt. 

 

R: I just reme mber being there.  I don't 
reme mber getting there.  Maybe I sl ept. 

 

Q: And you lived with your mother? 

 

I: Yes, we were with our mo m.  

 

Q: What do you reme mber about Theresiens
tadt?    School, food?   Wa s your mother 
working?  

 

I: I really have very sketchy reme mbra nces. 
 I just Š I reme mb er cobblestone roads for 
some  reason.  And I remember archways Š like 
tunnel like Š I have no idea, it could be 
some place else.  I have  this flashi
ng thing of bodies in an open cart. 
 

R: I was just going to get to that.  I reme mber
 carts being drawn through the streets.  I knew 
they were bodies.  I don't  re me mber them be
ing open, but I knew that they were Š don't know 
how, but that seems to be in the picture very, very often.

I: And I also reme mber there, that Š I think we
 used to wait on line there.  I think we used 
to wait on lines.  Or ma ybe that's earlier, I'm not
 sure.  And then some thing strange.  I reme mber 
music.  I reme mber mu sic.  Music, so that late
r on when I heard certain 
things, they like sounded 
like, ﬁOh, I know that,ﬂ and I don't know it, and I 
shouldn't know it, because I've never heard it, 
like, ﬁYes, I've heard this.ﬂ  
So, I don't reme mber what our mo m did or whether we actually Š I 
can't  reme mber what we did during a day or Š.  I really don't. 

 

01:16:28 

 

R: No, I don't either.  The only real strong me mo
ry I have is the pict
ure taking session, and I 
think we have that picture ofmy mo m and us leaning on her shoul
der.  I can almost feel the 
ma terial on her dress.  It was very coarse, rough, 
wool like and can almost smell it.  That's my 
real only recollection of feeli
ng my mother.  That's the only 
thing.  That really was very 
powerful.  That happened in Theresienstadt, I kn
ow now.  Do you reme mber that picture taking? 
 

I: Vaguely, not as clear on detail as you. 

 

R: Well, it ma de an impression on me .  I don't re me mber the circumstances, but I'll never 

forget that feel. 

 

I: The next me mory I have shortly after that 
is us walking.  It was night time , through the 
snow and our mo m had a suitcase that she was dr
agging along and I reme mber I didn't, I kind of 
didn't want to go wherever it was that we were 
going.  I reme mber she gave me  a real yank, like 
ﬁyou just come !ﬂ  That's  when I remember he
r presence because I remember her actually pulling 
me .  
 
R: I guess I was going peacefully because I don't 
reme mber the pulling.  I do reme mber that 
night, though, and I remember dogs. 

 

I: Yes, yes, there were dogs barking.  Then we got on a train. 

 

R: That train ride, I reme mber.  This now we now
 know this was the train ride to Auschwitz.  
But the combination of heat, odor, crammed quarters,
 the sighs, the agony of
 it in the car.  You 
heard the people just die. 

 

I: Therewasmoaning. 

 

R: It was horrible. 

 

I: And being little it was like 
hard to, you know, it was just Š 
all these bodies kind of next 
to you and I reme mber I just wanted
 to, like, I wanted to lie down. 
 

R: Yes, right.  We couldn't lie down for some  reason. 

 

I: There was no place. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
8 
 
 
R: There was no place or  there wasn't  room, or
 it was too dirty or  it was like Š nowhere to 
lie down. 

 

I: You couldn't.  There was no place.  You just kind of had to stay the way you got on.  And 

Š but we didn't cry. 

 

R: No. 

 

I: Wedidn't. 

 

01:19:16 

 

Q: Whynot? 

 

I: We were scared.  We  kne w that crying
 was not some thing you did.  You didn't cry. 
 

R: I don't think we wanted to add anything to 
that noise there already.  It was a long train 
ride. 

 

I: We had already learned the need to 
be silent to be qui
et and well behaved. 
 

R: Probably. 

 

Q: Can I go back for just a mi nute?    

 
I: Sure. 
 

Q: Do you think you were afraid in Theresiens
tadt?   Do you have any recollection of being 

afraid? 

 

R: For our personal safety? 

 

I: I don't think so, no. 

 

R: I mean, we s a w these things going on and I think we just assume d that this is the way 

things are.  I think our mother must have provi
ded, I'm not just guessing, 
must have provided us 
with a real security t
ype of blanket that we weren't, or 
it was our youth and we really didn't 
understand. 

 

Q: On the train, how were the adults Š we
ll, was anybody relating to
 anybody else?   We re 
some  people talking or wa s there just a lot of noi
se people screaming?   What other recollections 

do you have?   Wa s your mother holding you?  
 You holding onto your mo ther's  leg? 
 

R: We were very close to her at all times
.  I think everybody was into their own Š I don't 
reme mber people mi xing or doing for one another. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
9 
 
 
I: I kind of reme mber a moan or a cry here
 and there. But no, I don't, I think everybody was 
scared.  I think that was the fi
rst time that I felt like, ﬁOh my 
God, what is going to happen?ﬂ 
 

R: I wasn't  there yet with
 that sort of thinking. 
 

Q: Do you remember s mells? 

 

R: Oh yeah.  It was strong. 

 

I: It was terrible. 

 

R: Every kind of s mell, excretion, either from
 the bottom or from throw up or Š there was 
just no sanitation, nothing.  Wherever 
you were, that's  where it happened. 
 

Q: So you also urinated or
 moved your bowels there or do you have a recollection? 
 

R: I don't reme mber. 

 

I: I don't reme mber that. 

 

R: My mother must have taken care of that.  She always had, right? 

 

I: I would imagine. 

 

Q: Do you remember arriving at this st
range place that now has a name ?    
 

R: Uh-hum,yeah. 

 

I: Yep. 

 

Q: Describeit. 

 

R: It was night.  I heard yelling "Raus,
2
" snowing a little bit too, I think. 
 

I: Yes. 

 

R: And it was refreshing at first,
 when they first opened the doors.  I mean we had air for the 
first time , and it just hit you, it was good, but
 then the rest of 
it started happening. 
 

01:22:52 

 

I: I reme mber just that we had 
to walk a little.  I don't know 
if it was a long distance.  It's 
hard to tell, but we walked and then I reme
mber finding Š we all, everybody off of that, 
                     
 2
 Out! (German) 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320

everybody went into the same place.  We went in
to this bi g, like, barn or some thing.  I don't 
know.  It had a thing down the center 
with stones.  Do you reme mber that? 
 
R: No, it sounds more like a 
barrack that you describe. 
 

I: Maybe. 

 

R: That's what I was in later. 

 

I: Well, that's where we were with our mom al
so and there was just a lot of other people 
there, as well, with families. 

 

R: It'spossible. 

 

Q: But the three of
 you were together? 
 

I: Yes. 

 

R: You say that with great certainty, so you 
reme mb er?   I mean, I think we we re, too. 
 

I: Oh, yes I reme mber being together. 

 

R: I don't reme mber my mother.  
I'm trying so hard to do that. 
 

I: I reme mber being together 
and then at some  point our mo m e ven took us to the hospital 
to have a medical examination and this I reme
mber because Š sorry, René Š you used to cry a 
lot.  You didn't  like doctors, and I wa s only wo
rried that you were going to cry and some thing 
terrible was going to happen to you because I was a stoic. 

 

R: Icried? 

 

I: You didn't, not that time.  But I reme mber 
that our mo m took us.  She was with us once. 
 

Q: This was at some  point? 

 

I: At some  poi nt. 

 

Q: Do you remember being tattooed? 

 

R: Yes.  I reme mber being tattooed.  I reme mber
 the pain of the needle as they ma de the 

dots, and just surrounding it was 
this awful odor and I'm not s ure
 what that odor was, but the 
tattooing come s together with an odor for me .  So
 Š but I don't re me mbe r  anything else but just 
that needle. 

 

01:25:31 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
11 
 
Q: But your numbers are quite different, so you 
were not tattooed at the same  ti me  or you 
don't know?  
 

R: I don't know. 

 

I: I think we were. 

 

R: I mean, we now know that the numbers that we
re given to girls and to
 boys were different 
so we know this for a fact now.  So, the numbe
rs wouldn't be sequential, but I don't reme mber 
anybody else being tattooed except myself.  I mea
n, I don't reme mber Irene being tattooed or my 
mother being tattooed. 

 

I: I don't have much of a recollection of the tattooing. 

 

R: You don't reme mber the tattooing?   Such a sharp Š. 

 

I: Yeah, but I don't know... 

 

R: Wereme mb er 
different things. 
 

Q: And your hair, were you shaved? 

 

I: No. 

 

R: I don't think so. 

 
I: No, absolutely not.  I had l
ong hair at the end of the war. 
 
Q: Were you with othe r families? 

 

I: In the beginning, when we were with my 
mo m, it seemed like there were grown ups and 
younger people and so I guess.  I didn't  really kn
ow.  It seemed like a lot of different ages. 
 

Q: Was it possible that you were in the family ca mp, the Czech family ca mp ? 

 

I: Verypossible. 

 

Q: Do you remember food during this time 
when you were still with your mother? 
 

I: My only recollection of food is always the sa
me .  It's that black bread and some thing like 
potatoes or vegetable so
mething, wa rm something. 
 

R: I don't have any recollection of food until late
r when I had to Š when we were separated 
and I had to sift through garbage to 
get at potatoes.  That seemed to
 have been my favorite thing.  
I would get a potato, ma ke very thin slices and pu
t it onto that stove.  Most of the potatoes were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
12 
 
rotten, but still, put it on the stove, and then some how whatever came out, you ate.  That's the 
only food I ever reme mber eating. 

 

I: I reme mber later on, after we were se
parated, I vaguely reme mber that Š I guess 
some body gave the food out Š and I reme mber I 
thought I wa s terribly clever at the time , 

because I would get this piece of bread and I wasn
't  that hungry and I figured I'd be so much 
hungrier in the morning, so I decided, ﬁI'll just 
have bite or two and I'll save this for the 
morning.ﬂ  But, of course, when the morning came
, the bread was gone.  So, I think that the rats 
really loved me. 

 

01:28:40 

 

R: Rats?   You don't think ot
her people took it from you? 
 

I: No, I think it was the rats probably.  I would 
like not to think that.  
I just thought the rats, 
because there were rats. 

 

R: This is very interesting, b
ecause this is the Passover season for us now and we break the 
mi ddle ma tzo, we take a portion of 
it and hide it.  That's  why 
it's called poor man's bread and 
that's exactly what she was doing.  She would take a pi
ece of it, eat it, and then
 hide the rest of it 
and she never got to eat the rest of it. 

 

I: The worst was that I was so stupid.  
I just kept doing it over and over again. 
 

R: You didn't learn a lesson. 

 
I: Didn't see m to learn. 
 

Q: Do you remember when you were separated? 

 

R: Yes. 

 

Q: Could you describe it? 

 

R: Well, to me  it wasn't  our separation to me
, it was a feeling, it was a separation from my 
mother.  She was, like, Š  she was taken away from
 us.  I 'm not sure what I heard or what I felt, 
but it was my mother and that was the only time  th
at I felt that she was 
in real agony.  It was a 
feeling, maybe a cry out or something, but I kne
w some thing was terribly, terribly wr ong and 
that was the separation that I reme mber.  

 

I: I also remember it 
a little differently, but... 
 

R: Well, it's probably more accurate... 

 

I: No,no. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
13 
 
R: ...from your point of view. 
 

I: No, no.  I reme mber knowing that some th
ing was changing and some thing horrible was 
about to take place, and I do reme mb er an 
SS hitting our mo m.  I reme mber she didn't Š 
 

R: You saw this? 

 

I: I just reme mber, yes, because we didn't  
want to let go of her and we were actually 
physically separated, you know, like kind of torn
 apart from her, pulled away.  I don't know 
what, ma ybe  she screame d, but I reme mber a slap, 
she was hit.  I kind of Šif I close my eyes, I 
think she fell to the floor. 

 

R: It fits into my thinking.  I don't reme mb
er it as vividly as you would.  It fits. 
 

01:31:28 

 

I: After that, I don't re me mber what
 happened immediately after that. 
 

R: Really we were hurting, I think I was.  I know
 that was a very emotional time , very, very 
hurtful, and after that, we were, 
like, we were separated.  I re
me mber being separated from you 
but we were just in di fferent pl aces.  I 
was with the boys, young boys, olde r boys and me n. 
 

I: I don't know where I was.  I was just with
 other women.  I just reme mber that your 
barrack, for some  strange reason, I always said was 
a little bit over the righ
t.  It was in that 
direction. 

 
R: It's funny, I reme mber directions too, but I 
have no, I never studied the ma p of Auschwitz 
or anything.  I reme mber where my barracks wa
s, I reme mber where the gates were and I 
reme mber where the crematorium were with resp
ect to my barrack.  I reme mber people walking 
into this crematorium day and night
 just about.  I couldn'
t tell you just in my own circle I could 
tell you if you put me  there again.  Pl ease don't. 

 

01:32:49 

 

Q: I think we should stop. 

 

(Pause on tape) 

 

Q: Since you were sepa rated at this point, wh
at I would like to do, is focus on each of your 
stories separately although, of c
ourse, you can talk or elaborate if some one forgets some thing.  
So, let's focus on you, Irene, and where you 
remember you were and what happened? 
 

 

01:33:22 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320

I: Well, again, like I said before, my memories 
aren't  consecutive.  They'r e kind of sporadic 
and, very often, things in my 
everyday life today kind of Š when
 I'm doing certain things they 
stir and trigger a me mory for me that's relate
d to what happened to me  in Auschwitz, and my 
ma jor me mo ries of Auschwitz ar
e certainly being hungry and cold
 very often, and I reme mber 
watching people running to the el
ectric barbed wire and then 
they didn't move anymor e.  I 
reme mber having to stand outside for very long periods of time.  I don't know exactly for what, 
just Š and I always tried to hi
de.  I thought if I wouldn't be se
en then that would be good, so I 
always tried to find some body taller
 to stand behind.  I reme mber the barrack.  I reme mber there 

was this oven or some thing warm running dow
n the center that you could sit on, on it.  I 
reme mber people sitting on there.  I reme mber on
e night I was Š I felt extremely alone.  I had 
gone to the latrines that were in the back, and 
I became disoriented, so I forgot on which side of 
this oven or whatever my bed was on, and I star
ted groping to get into 
some body's bunk, because 
I was scared that if th
ey found me  wandering around that I'd 
be beaten.  What happened was so 
unexpected, because wherever I tried to get i
n, the hands were just pushi ng me  a way saying, 
ﬁthis is not your place, th
is is not your place.ﬂ   
 

01:35:59 

 

I: It was almost dawn before some  kind pers
on finally said, ﬁCome in and be with me .ﬂ  

And it just stuck with me  all the time.  I can 
still feel so unwanted, 
you know, like nobody cared. 
 

R: I don't believe Š that's so Š I never really
 heard this.  I reme mber you s a ying once that 
you couldn't find your way back, but I never heard the 
explanation of it.  If 
I ma y, I think just the 
standing in line or standing outside
 for great periods, I reme mber th
at too, but I reme mber that as 
roll call.  There were lines, we were made to sta
nd in lines.  They mi ght not have been the same  
lines, but we had, we had to stand in lines a
nd numbers and name s were yelled and down and up 
and down the line and the soldiers, soldier, o
fficer, whoever very often stopped at some body and 
just hit them and knocked them down to the gr
ound for apparently no reason, but this happened 
almost all the time.  I me an, I seen that
 ma ny, ma ny times happening over and over again.  

 

I: I kind of also reme mber peopl
e being beaten or punished for 
whatever.  I'm not sure what 
it was that they had done, but I also reme mber
 seeing some body hang.  I don't know where, but I 
reme mber once, I don't know what was going on, but I felt I needed to hide.  I don't know where 

this was exactly, but there were, I actually found 
myself hiding with dead bodies.  I don't know 
from what exactly either, but that's a me mory.  I,
 of course, have unfortunately a lot of me mories 
of the hospital and the doctor's  office.   

 

01:38:37 

 

I: I seem to recall spending a 
great deal of time there, and 
also being in the hospital and 
being very sick, and I know one time , when I we
nt to the doctor's office, that they took blood 
from me and it was extremely painful because it wa
s from the left side of my neck.  That's a 
strange thing to reme mb er.  I also reme mber havi
ng blood taken out of my finger, but that wasn't  
quite so bad.  I also reme mber having to sit very
 still for long periods to 
be measured or weighed 
or in x-rays.  I reme mber x-rays, x-rays and inj
ections.  I reme mber injections, and then I'd be 
sick.  Because then I'd be in this hospital, 
and I reme mber having a high fe ver, because I know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
15 
 
they were taking my te mperature.  Some body was.  I re
ally got to hate doctors. 
 I got to be afraid.  
I was terr ibly scared of doctors.  I still am.  
They are a ni ghtmare.  Hospitals are out of the 
question and illness is unacceptable. 

 

R: Do you ever reme mber being cut or someth
ing like that because 
I think you me ntioned 
once Š I never heard a lot of the things that you 
just said, but I reme mbe r
 you saying that once. 
 

I: I reme mber, but this is so unclear, it sounds 
bizarre.  I reme mber some thing with electric 
wires, but I just reme mb er Š because always after the war, you know me , I'm so crazy, I can't  

stand to touch an electric wire. 
 I get, I actually have like an an
xiety attack.  For a long time, I 
used to have anxiety attacks when I would have 
to plug in an outlet and 
it was especially painful 
to me , because I went to school and I ma jored 
in biochemi stry and I taught physics and biology 
and I would have to do these experime nts with the 
class and I would have to
 plug these things in 
and I'd get these horrible anxiety attacks when it 
had to do with electrical things and ma gnets and 
things like that in phys
ics.  I was a wreck.   
 

01:41:44 

 

I: I reme mber some  kind of shock, don't know.  And the thing that you refer about being 

cut, again, it's  just a vague thing of being on an icy cold table and I don't know why I keep seeing 

eyes, and it just I know that there was a doctor th
ere and he had an instrume nt.  Like, it looked 
like a knife, obviously, it wasn't  a knife, but it 
was some thing, and I reme mber him just kind of 
touching me with it and I, that's it.  I don't re me
mber anything else abou
t that.  I think I don't 
want to. 

 

Q: Was anybody kind to you? 
 
I: I really, I can't re me mbe r . 
 I felt no, it didn't seem to be Š I always felt just outside 
some how.  I reme mber being a little jealous be
cause it seemed like there was, there were two 

girls and it seemed like their mother Š I don'
t know how they had a mot her or some body who 
would bring them things. 

 

R: Little girls?   They
 were little girls? 
 

I: No, bigger than me , but they had somebody who brought them things, who was very 

close to them some how  and I reme mber, you know
, kind of watching with great deal of envy. 
 

Q: Did you know you were twins? 

 

I: No, no, I don't think so.  I knew I had a brot
her, but I had no idea 
of what twin even 
meant.  In all of this, everything that happened, 
I always just thought this
 was what life was.  I 
couldn't remember anything else anymore, and 
I used to think some ti me s about our mother, 
fleetingly, like, ﬁWell, maybe I'm never supposed to
 see her again Š this 
is how things are.ﬂ  
And then just knowing that there 
was René over there.  And then 
I reme mb er one particular night 
that I was especially concerne
d about René, because there was 
like a big explosion, and there 
was a fire and it was all off to that side, to th
e right.  I rememb er ly
ing on my bunk bed and there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
16 
 
seemed to be a lot of commotion and I was scar
ed that ma ybe it was his barrack burning.  So I 
reme mber that as a real clear scare. 
 

Q: Did you think about him a lot? 

 

01:45:08 

 

I: In some  way, I did.  I kind of felt I had to 
stay in there because he was going to need me .  
That's  pretty egotistical.  Well... 

 

Q: Do you remember other young girls in the sa
me  barrack?   We re you 
with other people 
who also had these funny things happening to
 them, these horrible me dical experime nts? 
 

I: I thought I was the only one.  In fact, it's 
interesting, when in 1985, when we first found 
out there were other twins who su
rvived Auschwitz, I said to Re
né, ﬁI thought we were the only 
kids who survived, how could there be anybody el
se, what you do mean there are twins?ﬂ  So, 
no, I had no idea that anybody else 
wa s having anything done to them. 
 

Q: Are there any other things you want to tell
 us about Auschwitz before the liberation? 
 

I: I reme mber once in the hospital there, I wa
s there and some thing was going to happen.  It 
seemed all the patients were being evacuated 
or cleared out or some
thing and I remember 
some body who worked in the hospital grabbed me  a
nd hid me behind her and just said, ﬁbe very 
quiet.ﬂ  Of course I was.  I mean, if I could ha
ve disappeared I would have, and that's all I know.  
I don't know who it was and I don't know what she mi
ght have saved me  or not saved me  from.  
And so that... 
 
Q: Were you ever beaten? 

 

I: No, no, not that I Š no. 

 

Q: Do you remember getting weaker and weaker? 

 

I: Yes, I do.  I reme mber getting weaker and 
weaker because towards the end just before 
liberation, I was on the ground and I could not even
 get up.  And there were other people also on 
the ground to my recollection, and I 
didn't know if I was ever going to be able to get up off this 
floor.  But I don't think I underst
ood what ﬁto be deadﬂ meant even then, because I just didn't 
know what was going to be.  I reme mber there 
were also, I reme mber sirens and bombings, 
noise, gun fire or ma ybe bombs.  I'm not sure
.  Do you reme mber that at all?   Si rens? 
 

01:48:23 

 

R: Yes, I reme mber sirens and then the hum 
of the airplanes and they would always get 
everybody in and they would stand a soldier outside
 our barrack, one soldie
r outside the barrack.  
Don't know why. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
17 
 
I: But I reme mber that when that happened, Igot very scared, when there were the sirens 
and the sound of the airplanes, because some how I understood some thing about bombs and, and 

you could really get hurt. 

 

R: It was not a natural course of 
events that was happening there. 
 

I: And also, do you reme mber every once in a wh
ile a siren would just go off and it was like 
there'd be a lot of co
mmotion and the soldiers? 
 
R: Right,yeah
 
 
I: Do you remember? 

 
R: 
but I can™t put that together rightŠ 
 
I: Just Š I, I don™t know.  I 
guess I don™t  either.  Just a flip that came into my head. 
 

Q: Were you liberated in Auschwitz by the Ru
ssians?   You ma y not have known that... 
 

I: Yes.  I mi ght not have known that that's wh
at it was.  I was literally picked up by a Polish 
lady who just took me  to her home.  I reme mber she carried me  on her shoulders the whole way, 

because I couldn't, couldn't  walk. 

 

Q: You were eight? 

 

I: Yes. Going to be eight Š 

 

R: You were, you were Š your seventh year is December.  You turned seve n in December. 

 

I: Oh, I had just turned seven. 
 
R: You were just a little bit over seven. 
 Sa me  as me  Š that's  how I reme mb er. 
 

I: Goodpoint. 

 

Q: Rene, let's go to you and your months now in Auschwitz as you're alone. 

 

R: Well, I'm going to juxtaposition my things 
with hers.  The long waits and roll calls, 
some thing that we me ntioned before.  The wire
s, yes, electric, ever
y once in a while, some body 
would go against those wires and then be still, but 
the wires to me  were always near  my barrack 

for some  reason, were the backdrop of a hole, a 
long, deep ditch where I reme mber very often, 
very, very often they would just line up people 
and shoot them, because I reme mber as me  and 
some  other young youngsters, we we nt over to see wh
at was happening to some  of those people.  
I do reme mb er one instance, where the person wasn't  quite dead.  He didn't stop moving.  I do 

reme mber him having a big bump on his head and the people, there some  of the people, actually 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
18 
 
pulled him out into the barracks.  He was still aliv
e.  But it was a curiosity kind of a thing.  This 
was the natural daily routine there, and I re
me mb er this happening very, very often.   
 
01:51:49 

 

 But so much for the wires.  I was with others
, I had to think were twins, my visits to the 
hospital, I don't think, were anywhere near as fr
equent as Irene's and I don't re me mbe r  ever being 
invaded into my body.  The only 
thing I reme mb er them doing to me  is measuring and I do 
reme mber the Röntgen
3
, the x-ray, I guess it was.  ﬁRöntgen,ﬂ I reme mber that name , they used 
Röntgen a lot, and I had to stand stil
l or sit still for a very long time 
for this process to take place.  
And it was cold wherever you were.  That was just
 about the experience w
ith the hospital, very 
mi ni ma l compared to Irene's.  My barrack was, I 
think, one of those long things with a stove in 
the mi ddle or whatever that brick structure was. I 
used that to bake rotten potatoes on and to sit 
on and warm on.  Sleeping in the bunks, I just reme
mber that smell of that wood against my nose 
and splinters also, because that wasn't soft 
wood.  It was raw wood, very raw because you could 
really smell it.  It was just about the only refr
eshing smell, fresh kind of an odor that you had 
there. It was woodsy, it was wood.  I reme mber ve
ry clearly going to sl
eep, because I was near 
the wood.  Cold always, hungry always.  I reme mb
er asking who's the ma ster of the world, who 
runs this, who's the ma ster of the world.  I 
was told Hitler Š Hitle
rŠ but I didn't question 
anything.  This was the norm.  This was the way 
things were, but I did have friends, which Irene 
didn't.  I think the me n, the older me n, sort of to
ok care of one another in some  special way that 
the wome n didn't.  I don't know why.  I do reme mb
er getting a pair of shoes once.  I don't know 
why I know this.  I got a pair of shoes which didn'
t quite fit.  They were brown, tall, going over 
the ankles, but they cost some body a loaf of brea
d.  There mus t  have been a ma rket going on, but 

I do reme mb er being the recipient of this once. 

 
01:54:40 
 

Q: There were older me n in your barrack? 

 

R: Yes. 

 

Q: Were there older wome n in your barrack, too? 

 

I: Yes. 

 

R: And I was very close to the crematoria, 
because there was a constant flow of people 
going into this and nobody every comi ng out.  I wa s ve
ry close to that road.  I was, like, very 
close to the barracks. I al
ways had a view of that. 
 

Q: Could you smell? 

 

R: Yes.  The odor was just bad.  It was just
 bad.  Everything there 
was bad.  Foul, all the 
odors were foul except for that wood.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320

I: I just reme mbered some thing that for y
ears, even today some times that besides you Š 
you know, you just said the smells.  Yes, it always was Š there was an awful s mell there.  It was 

horribl e all the time, but what I remembered is 
waiting in line naked. 
 Standing outside naked 
waiting on line to get into the showers and so
metimes we'd sta nd out there for many hours it 
seemed and some how I reme mber that was scar
y, because I don't know now, but I knew that 
some ti me s you didn't get your clothes at the end of
 this shower and you weren't going to be able 
to come  back.  But again, being probably silly 
child, at one time I had a locket from my mother 
that I wore around my ne ck and I knew that wh
en we undressed for the showers if anybody saw 
this, it would be real trouble, but I was brazen 
enough to think that I could 
actually get away with 
hiding this in my hands, so I do reme mber taking 
it off my ne ck and holding it very tightly in my 
hand to get into the shower and I probably lost it
 then right in the shower because Š didn't come  
out with it but I reme mb er it was an act of defi
ance on my pa rt.  I said ﬁI can do this.ﬂ  I did. 
 

Q: Did you have showers with some  regularity?   

 

I: Yes. 

 
R: I don't reme mber any showers at all, but that doesn't  mean
.  I do reme mber though, I 
did see Irene once.  I saw her once across Š a wire fence.  I don't know whether I was walking 
to the hospi tal myself, but I saw her some where in
 the mi ddle and I recognized her.  Nothing was 

said and I just looked at her 
and I knew she was there.  I don't know if she reme mbers the 
moment, but I always, from that 
point on, and I think ma ybe even before, I knew that she was 

alive.  It was the inspiration, 
it was the motivation to keep me  going.  I knew I had to stay, stick 
around and do until I met her for her sake, or for 
whatever sake, but I knew that you were there 
some where there and in a certain di rection. 

 

I: I don't really recall 
the mome nt, though I'm really trying 
hard to see if I can, but I do, I 
must in some ways recall it on a 
different level, because I knew 
that you were alive, so I must 
have known because then later on,after liberation, I knew that you we
re alive, so perhaps I did 
see you and I just don't recall it.

Q: Rene, you were describing Š not individual 
people, but, in some  way, the relationships 
there.  Did you feel less alone than, than 
Irene described hersel
f?   Or did you feel... 
 

R: I would have to think that I wasn't  alone. 
 I was with other people.  I did not, however, 
think of Irene or my mot her.  I just a
ccepted what was there and went with it. 
 

Q: Did you ever cry? 

 

R: I don't reme mber.  I'm s ure I did, but I don't remember crying, no.  Just to catch up to 

Irene's liberation, I was also libe
rated pretty muc h at the same 
time, but under totally different 
circumstances.  I reme mber before the end came,
 the end of Auschwitz, 
the liberation, there was 
an increased amount of noise,
 which I now know was gun fire around, and less of a German 
presence.  We were ma rched some where from 
some  point to some where and whoever couldn't 
do this ma rching, if they stepped 
out of line or fell down, they we
re just eliminated, so I knew I 
had to keep ma rching.  Again, there was increased gun 
fire at this point, I'd have to say it was, 
and then all of a sudden the Germans were gone. 
 They were just gone, and we were surrounded 
by these white uniformed Š which I know were Russi
ans now.  That's  how my liberation Š I do 

have to insert, that I do reme mber one Russian
 solider, officer on a horse, which to me  looked 
pink.  It looked like a pink horse 
to me , but that's one of the me mories, and the white uniforms.  
Defi nitely white uniforms. 

 

Q: Was it night or day? 
 
R: Night. 

 

Q: What languages were you speaking in Auschwitz? 

 

R: That's a good question, because I just thought
 of it myself and I don't really reme mber 
whether it was or what it was. 

 

I: Actually, we spoke German and Czech, 
because I did understand what Š I understood 
what was going on around me . 

 

R: Well, I understood too, but I never put it togeth
er.  If Ger mans were 
talking, I understood, 
I guess I did... 

 

I: That ma kes sense because our parents cam
e from Ger many, so we probably grew up 
speaking German and Cz ech. 

 

Q: In the barrack, do you reme mber what the in
ma tes were talking?   Do you reme mber not 
understanding a lot of people? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
21 
 
I: Yes, yes, I did not necessarily 
understand the people.  That's  true. 
 
R: I don't reme mber any conversations really.  
I'm t r ying to think on it now as we'r e talking, 
but no, not really.  Just there were
 these questions that I posed to
 people, and they would answer 
it and that wa s it.  That was enough. 

 

02:04:45 

 

Q: Did you also get black bread? 

 

R: I don't reme mber black bread at all. 

 

Q: So, what you reme mber is stealing potatoes? 

 

R: Potatoes. 

 

Q: You don't reme mber being fed? 

 

R: No. 

 

Q: Do you remember drinking anything? 

 

R: No. 

 

Q: Irene, do you? 

 
I: Yes, some thing brown, but I don't know what it was. 
 

R: There was a liquid.  There was a liquid serve
d.  I don't ever reme mber ever partaking of 
it, but there was a pot, yes.  There wa s a pot and 
people would sort of line of for this thing.  I 
don't re me mber ever having any. 

 

Q: Do you remember the latrines? 

 

R: No. 

 

Q: You have no recollection of where you went to the bathroom? 

 

R: None, absolutely none. 

 

I: Now I do reme mber, I thought at one time that
 I actually saw like bones 
in the latrine.  I 
don't know. 

 

R: That's strange.  It's really st
range that I can't , I don't re me mbe r . 
 

Q: Do you ever reme mber washing your hands? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
22 
 
 
R: No. 

 

Q: Do you remember what you were wearing? 

 

R: It didn't fit, whatever it was, and it was a
ll over me. It was on my head, it was all over, 
but I don't reme mber what it was. 

 

Q: What happened to you when you were libe
rated, when the Russian on the pink horse 
came? 

 

R: Well, I reme mber being ma rched a little furt
her with a throng of 
people into a warehouse 
of food, and I reme mber getting hold of a golden l
ooking can and rolling it.  I reme mbe r  that was 
my, that was my prize.  And when they finally op
ened it, it turned out to 
be sauerkraut.  That's  
what I reme mber about it. 

 

Q: Did you eat it? 

 

R: Yeah, tasted it. 

 

Q: Did you get sick? 

 

R: No, I don't reme mber getting si ck.  I understa
nd that a lot of people did get very, very 
sick from eating. 

 

Q: Do, do you reme mber where they took you?  
 Did they take you back to Auschwitz? 
 

R: I don't reme mber. 

 

02:07:39 

 

Q: And then what happened?   I mean, were 
you there for a very long time or did some one Š
? 

 

R: Time  is just totally meaningl
ess at this point.  My very ne
xt real me mories Š I know that 
I went to, to a hospital some where, but my ne
xt me mories are in an orphanage in Koıice, 

Czechoslovakia. 

 

Q: What happened there? 

 

R: This was obviously after the war.  It was 
a Catholic or phanage  or hospital, because I 

reme mber being embraced by these nuns. In fact
, I reme mbe r  once being embraced by a very 
large nun to the point  where I lost one of my 
teeth, which had to be loose, because it was 
obviously an embrace of love, not a hurting ki nd of th
ing.  But those are just 
little things.  And I 
was with a lot of children, but there was an admi
nistrator in this hospital who took me into his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
23 
 
home  one day where I lived with them.  His na me is
, was, is, is still Doctor  Kalina (ph) .  His fi rst 
name , I think, was Frank.   
 

I: Oh, it's Steven. 

 

R: Well, Doctor  Kalina.  Let's leave the fi
rst name out because I don't really Š Doctor 
Kalina Š his wife's  na me was Helen and they had a baby girl and I lived in an apartment on one 

of the streets in Koıice with them.  They were
 very nice to me.  I reme mb er some thing very 
specifically that happened in that house.  Like a Ch
ristmas tree, a little goat that  they let me keep 

in the very narrow back yard.  A real little goat
.  He had a car, a green convertible, which I know 
now is a very unusual thing for some body to have
.  He must have been some body important in 
that hospital setting.  This was an orphanage hos
pital complex.  It was huge.  To me , at  that 

point, it seemed huge.  I  reme mber every weeken
d I would get an allowance and I was able to 
buy some , ten decagrams of salami  in the but
cher store.  Was my treat for the week. 
 

02:10:34 

 

Q: Did you know you were Jewish? 

 

R: I had the feeling.  I had the feeling, which rea
lly came just out a little
 bit later when this 
Doctor Kalina had to leave his home, leave the 
country.  Because some wher
e Š he had to leave, 
and I think it had to do with Co
mmunist takeover at that time in
 Czechoslovakia and I started to 
go to school in Koıice, and he left me with
 his sister, Edith Mann, and her husband, Joseph 
Mann.  They had a boy, Otto, and a girl, Bibi (ph), 
Bibi, we lived very cl
ose to the school, and I 
knew I was Jewish then because, first of all, th
ey were Jewish and I was called a Jew in the 
school.  Everyday when I, when school got out Š 
there was one other Jew in the entire school.  
His name  was Sobol (ph).  I'll never forget the 
name , Sobol.  I don't know his first name , but the 
boys are waiting for us to beat us and stone us 
every single day.  It wa
s a hassle to get out of 
school.  I don't know why it wasn't  a problem goi
ng to school, but leaving school every day was 
a horror show. 

 

 

Q: Did the fami ly know this?   Did you tell them?  

 

R: I think they knew it, but ma ybe they 
Š I don't think anything was done.  The school 
admi nistration, now that I'm thinking about it, 
probably didn't do anything either, because I do 
reme mber being exposed to Catholic teachings in 
the classroo m and we did go to church together 

for whatever.  I reme mbe r  always trying to be 
at the back, so I wouldn'
t maybe not get in, not 
enough room for me  to get in or some thing or to
 sneak away, but I knew I was Jewish, definitely 
from that.  They remi nded me that I was and I'
m sure the number on my arm was some  kind of a  
signal.  Though I know that not only
 Jews got numbers, but I think 
most Jews had that number.  I 
think it was an identifier and th
e number was there.  And I was, 
I also knew that I was Jewish, 
because the Mann fa mily did observe  certain ho
lidays.  I do reme mber going to synagogue in 
Koıice.  I don't re me mbe r  ever praying, but I 
do reme mber having fights 
with boys Š we'd sort 
of like divide the synagogue yard into two areas
 and chestnuts would fall and we'd throw these 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
24 
 
chestnut s at each other, making believe some 
kind of war was going on.  But there were other 
synagogues though.  I was Jewish. 

 

02:14:01 

 

Q: How long did you stay with the Manns (ph)? 

 

R: Well, I know it was about two years.  I thi
nk it was about two years, 'til just before I 
came, started my trek here to the States. 

 

Q: Of course, you reme mbe r ed Irene, becau
se...?   Did you tell people you had a sister?  
[Irene shakes his head] Why?  

 

R: I think I did tell them, after first contact 
was ma de, but it came  from America.  I think it 
came from Irene's side.  She's the one who so
me how Š well, she'll tell you how she let the 
people know she that had a brother,
 but no I wasn't  ma king it a Š. 
 

Q: But you don't know why? 

 

R: No, no, I knew.  I mean, it kept me  going, it kept me  going.  And I have to say that this 

Mann fa mily, they took me  in and they treate
d me  just like one of their children.  Very 

understanding woma n, this Edith Mann was.  She knew what a boy, a young boy was all about, 

and she let me  do things that a
ll boys, I think, should be doing at 
that point in life.  They bought 
me  Š in Cz echoslovak, it's kolobezka
4
, it's a scooter with just  tw
o wheels and a platform and a 
thing.  It was one of the fanciest ones, and I loved that. 

 
I: It's  funny.  You just remi nded Š we
 had those when we were little.  
 
R: Really? 

 

I: We had them. 

 

R: Maybe that's how I learne d how to ride them, because I was an expert. 

 

I: We had them, I reme mber.  You push off 
with one foot and you hold on.  We  had them, 
we had them.   

 

R: Yes, that was one of them.  They we re a 
wonderful family but that was life in Koıice.  

Oh, they let me do somet hing else.  She let 
me  buy two Angora rabbits.  I had two Angora, 
they'r e white rabbits with red eyes, and they were
 babies.  So they were very cute, when they 

were little, but then after a while they got to be 
big and we had to get rid of them.  So I'll never 

forget every weekend or every two weeks there 
wa s a ma rket, a farmer 's market would open up.  
All the farmers would come into a big square in
 the town and they w
ould sell their product, 
produce, whatever.  I was at one of those stands
 trying to sell Š I don't know if I was trying to 
sell my two rabbits.  I don't even remember 
if I ever sold them, but they disappeared.

Q: This is the third animal that you've me
ntioned.  You me ntioned a goat, and the two 
rabbits.  Is this some thing special? 

 

02:17:17 

 

R: I don't think so, because I'm not particularly
 crazy about animals, certainly not to live 
with them, which is apparently what was going 
on.  There was a dog also in Kalina's.  Some how 
I reme mber a dog, also a puppy, didn't last very long. 

 

Q: Did Doctor Kalina ha
ve a son or a daughter? 
 

R: Adaughter. 

 

Q: And the Manns? 

 

R: The Manns had a daughter and a boy, Otto. 

 

Q: Were you close with them?  
 Were they nice to you? 

 

R: Yes. 

 

Q: So, they all were nice?  

 

R: Yes.  I seem to be much luckier with my 
relationships with people 
after the war at least 
up to the Slotkins, then Irene appeared. 

 

 

Q: Was eating a problem, or did you, I mean...?  

 

R: For me , personally? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

R: No, I don't think so.  I do reme mber 
doing all the norma l things, you know, looking for 

treats and I ate everything, koshe
r or unkosher, which obviously, I had no idea about.  In fact, I 
do reme mbe r  now eating the unkosher things, lik
e, whatever it is
, it's called slanina
5
.  I think it's 
fat, I think it's just lard or
.  Shepherds used to eat this.  I 
reme mber going into the fields and 
shepherds would have this shepherd's bag and th
ey would pull out this big hunk loaf of bread and 

then unwrap this smaller meaty white looking white, 
mostly white and take a knife and cut.  It 
looked so great and delicious that I had to partake. 

 

Q: Was it good?

R: Yes.  I never had tr
ouble eating, I don't  think. 
 
Q: Did you feel lonely? 

 

R: Well, once I found out that Irene, in f
act, was alive and we made some  kind of 
connection, I just wanted to go.  I wanted to meet
.  I don't know what else I wanted, but I wanted 
to meet. 

 

Q: Irene, let's go back to you and take you 
up to the point Š this point.  So, this woma n 
takes you on her back, she carries... 

 

I: She carries me  piggy ba ck kind of fashion, 
and I'm holding on to her, and I don't have a 
clue to where we'r e going, but it didn't  take too lo
ng.  And I find myself in this apartment and it's 
facing a square, and diagonally across to the right 
is where the Russian soldiers are housed in 
some  big huge building.  It wa
s like a square, there were, and her name  wa s Mrs. Mucha. 
 

02:20:41 

 

R: Yes,Mucha? 

 

I: Means fly in Polish, and I reme mber now 
always being embarrassed to say the name  
because I knew what it meant and Š you know it's like... 

 

R: I've never heard this. 

 

I: I Š when I first got there, I must have been
 pretty sick.  And I reme mber that she had me  
in bed and she called, I guess, what was a doctor, 
and I reme mber having hot Š this is going to 
Š hot glasses Š that were heated glasses that we
re like put on the body at 
different parts.  Do 
you know what I'm talking about even? 

 

Q: No. 

 

I: It's  very, very weird.  I don't know what it
 was for, but I guess I eventually got better, 
because I did finally get out of 
bed, and I got enrolled in Catholic
 school and actually I think I 
knew, because you asked René about being Jewish, 
but I think I didn't want to be Jewish and I 

thought this was neat.  It was pr
etty Š the only thing is Mrs. Mu
cha was very, very, very strict, 
so that if I came  home  t wo mi nutes later than
 she thought it should have 
taken me  to walk home 
from school, we got punished. 

 

 

Q: How?  

 

I: We got hit. 

 

 

R: Who's"we?" 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
27 
 
 
I: Me, myself and I. 

 

R: Weretherea
ny other children? 
 

I: No, she had some body who mi ght have been
 her boyfriend.  I don't know.  I thought it 
was her son, but, you know, in retrospect now, 
I'm thinking, ma ybe I don't  know, you know, an 
adult ma le who would come  and visit every once in 
a while.  He used to get drunk, and he wasn't  
pretty when he got drunk. 

 

Q: Did he harm you? 

 

\I: Yes. 

 

Q: Sexually? 

 

02:23:06 

 

I: I don't want to talk about that.  I reme
mber going to school and going to church and I 
reme mber, that I Š when the priest called Š th
ere was a time when you could go down and they 
put some thing in your mouth, you know those white 
thin, looked so great, and I wanted to know 
if I was ever going to get a chance, but no such 
luck.  But, I do reme mbe r  having rosary beads 
and I became very devout, very devout.  You know, I really didn't want to be Jewish.  I mean, I 

was glad, ﬁthis is great.ﬂ  But I also Š ma ybe 
it wasn't  totally great.  In the summertime, she 
would take me  to visit.  She had fa mily in 
the countryside and it would be a long, hugely long 
walk.  It seemed like hours we'd walk with this
 wheelbarrow or some th
ing, because then we'd 
bring home produce from the farm.  Now, on the fa
rm, there were some ot
her children, but I was 
really devastated by them, because they ma de 
fun of my number.  And I didn't know how to 
stand up for myself.  I was very quiet and veryshy and I was very obedient.  I was a scared 

bunny.  I was scared all the time.  I reme mber one pa
rticular evening or day, I kind of got lost on 
the farm.  I don't know, it was getting dark and I 
didn't really know how to find my way back, 
and I guess I, they eventually found me , but I reme
mber being pretty scared.  I also, interesting 
enough, was put in charge of bunnies, of rabbits, I had to clean.  She had rabbits.  Not one, not 

two, rabbits, lots of rabbits, 
hutches, you know. I had to clean th
e rabbit cages, but I got very 
attached to the rabbits, but, you see, she used
 them for food, l i ke on Sundays we would have 
rabbit.  I couldn't eat.  She got very ma d at me  
and I got punished for that too, but I just couldn't 
eat the rabbits. I couldn't.  We  had a, we didn't 
have a bathroom in the apartment.  There was an 
outhouse.  I reme mber on Christmas, she told me 
that if I was a very good 
child and if I watched 
the sky, I would see Santa Claus come  down in his 
coach and I would get a pr
esent, if I was very 
good.  I remember I fell for this, and I believed he
r and I stayed up the en
tire night looking at the 
sky, and I never saw.  I thought I was good, but I guess I figured I wasn't  good enough and I 

never saw him.  And I didn't even get a present. 
 Well, I guess I got a present, it was a cookie 
ma de in the shape of what do th
ey call them like gingerbread Š 
R: A gingerbread house? 

 

I: No, like a person, like a little girl or some thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
28 
 
 
R: Yes, gingerbread cookie, yes doll, girl. 

 

I: I was so excited about this.  I reme mb
er guarding this, you know.  I never ate it, 
obviously, because to me this was my doll.   

 

02:27:23 

 

R: Saveit. 

 

I: Save it, right.  I'm big on saving. 

 

R: I want to ask you some t hing.  The numbers, you said the girls Š th
e kids ma de fun of 
your numbe rs?   Wa s that a Jewish thing or was 
it fun, playing fun, becaus
e you were different or 
because you were Jewish? 

 

I: Because I wa s Jewish. 

 

R: So, they were saying that you were Je
wish.  That's  what they were saying? 
 

I: Right.  So, I had a need to want to hide 
these things, because I 
really wanted to be 
Christian.  And some  of the Š it's funny, I reme mb
er, like, some  foods we had.  We  had bread 
with butter and sugar.  Do you reme mber bread with butter and sugar? 

 

R: Yes, I reme mber it.  Yeah. Also reme mber
 bread, butter and chocol
ate, and radishes Š 
slices of radishes. 
 
I: Yes, I reme mber that too.  But, 
basically she was very, very strict. 
 

 

Q: Was she ever nice? 

 

I: Well, she did care for me.  She got me  th
rough being ill and, as long as I got home on 
time and didn't, did everything right, she was okay. 

 

 

Q: Was she ever affectionate with you? 

 

I: No. 

 

R: It sounds pretty rough to me .  I have
n't really digested all of this ever. 
 

I: Well, you're saying it sounds pretty 
rough, but it was better 
than Auschwitz.  
R: Well, I'm comparing it to what I went through. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320

I: So when finally Š there, I, what I subse
quently learned was when the Joint Distribution 
or Agudah
6
 or some body finally was sending people to ta
ke out the children fr
om these Catholic 
home s and they came to take me  out, I did not wa
nt to leave and I was extremely upset at having 
to leave, to leave.  We  went to Bratislava and 
there it was some  kind of a  home  where there were 
other people.  It seemed to be a waiting place wher
e you got then sent elsewhere.  This was just a 
very temporary place and that's where I met a very
 dear friend who then went to Israel and I'm 
fr iends with her to this day, a
nd we would sit there w
ith our rosary beads 
talking about how we 
were going to escape from this place because we'd 
said, ﬁThis is Š look at them they'r e so dirty.  
They don't prepare things.  Look at this place, it's  
a me ss.ﬂ  We were real little Catholics here and 
she was the only person I spoke to wa s this frien
d, Miriam.  I didn't speak to anybody else.  I was 
very upset about having been taken 
out of this Mrs. Mucha's home . 
 

02:30:45 

 

Q: What do you mean it was dirty?   What
 was it about that you can reme mb er? 

 

I: They weren't dressed nicely, they were schlum
py and things were left 
on the table.  It was 
just messy, I guess, maybe not dirty, but just mess
y, and it bothered us.  We were neatniks in 
those days.  You should see my hous e now. 

 

 

Q: But you didn't  escape? 

 

I: No, no we didn't.  I got shipped to France and finally wound up in an orphanage in 

Fublaines, which is on the outskirts of Paris. 
 I was one of the youngest 
children there, and I 
didn't speak to anybody, except Miriam, who was, I 
guess, about seven years older.  She seemed 
like almost a mother figure in a sense to me , 
because I had these long curls and she would fuss 

with them and she just was very compassionate, 
and I, the other children Š I was the only child 
there with a number, so I also 
felt that there was some thing wrong 
with me .  I felt that I had done 
some thing horrible that I had gotten the number 
and nobody else did.  Most of these children had 
escaped some how by hiding, or their parents had 
temporarily given them over and some  were 

subsequently reunited with parents and some  just 
had fa mily me mbers and they were just waiting 
to be shipped to, and things like 
that.  Even when I was in Fublaines, I tried extra hard to be 
good.  I was ﬁMiss Goody Two Shoe s.ﬂ  I would he
lp.  Anybody needed help, I was there.  And I 
also was a stoic.  There was time when we were 
getting some kind of Š I really should go back 
and say I had all these horrible boils on my body at
 one point when I got to Fublaines.  I don't 

know if it was an infestation of lic
e, but all these huge scars on my 
legs.  A lot of us had it, and I 
reme mber, we had to go Š the couple that ran this
 home, the father was, I think, a doctor and we 
had to go to him every day and he'd put this cr
eam or some thing on it, and I reme mbe r  always 
trying to, like, be very brave a
nd, you know, show that it didn't hur
t because I thought then they'd 
like me  a little better than 
all the other children.

 I was a sick child.  We  were getting inoculat
ions at some  point fo
r something.  Somebody 
would come  to the home and all the children woul
d get inoculated and the arms would blow up 
and nobody could move their arms.  And ever
ybody stayed in bed.  Everybody except me .  I 
went down and, believe me , I was in pain, my 
arm was blown up too.  I bring breakfast to 
everybody.  I took breakfast to everybody.  Very st
range child.  Anything so that I could be a 
little special.  That's really what it was.  I wanted
 to be special.  And I 
was also Š a lot of the 
children from that Š it was a period
 of time whe n a lot of children were being shipped to Israel.  
I reme mber, I don't know how the sequence of time
, but I reme mber that our Aunt Paula Š we 
found out that our mo m had a sist
er in England Š and our Aunt 
Paula was contacted about us 
and I did know that I had René.  I didn't know wher
e he was, but I knew that
 I had a brother, and 
but I reme mber hearing through the grapevine that 
she really didn't want us.  I guess she had her 
own, she had a child at that time .  I think things
 were perhaps not so gr
eat in England at that 
time, and I guess she just didn't have room for the 
two of us.  That was, I sort of think I took it 
lightly then, but maybe I didn't, because it was just  
another reject.  And I was trying so hard to be 

good, all the time.  And then it came time and my  
friend Miriam was going to be going to Israel 
and I wanted very much to go with he r as well, 
but it was not my luck, because in the interim, 
there was a Mr. Herbert Tenzer
7
 who had for med an organization here called Rescue Children
8
 
and he would visit, he also had connection wi
th Barton's Candy, and we kids were crazy about 
him because he would bring candy and Š but the be
st thing was American gum.  That was the 
best.  Forget the candy, American gum.  That was it for me .   

 

02:36:40 

 

I: But it seeme d some how he Š of all the child
ren, he decided to pick me  to come  to the 
United States to raise money for the other homes that Agudah or Po™el ha-Mizrachi
9
, or whoever 
was running them.  He picked me  and another 
boy from another orphanage in France, by the 

name  of Cha r les Karo, and I reme mb er being extr
emely distraught about this, because I want to 
go with my friend Miriam.  I reme mber I was 
promised, ﬁjust for a 
little bit you'll go to 
America.ﬂ Š like I knew what America was, who 
cared?   I just knew I was being taken away Œ 

ﬁand you know then you'll come  bac k here and 
we'll send you to Israel and you'll be with 
Miriam.ﬂ  And of course, I believed them.  A
nd talking about candy just brought to mi nd a very 
early time.  It must have been someplace between
 Bratislava and Fublaines where I mi ght have 
been at another orphanage.  I was very little 
and there was a room, it must  have been whoever 
was running the orphanage and there was candy unde
rneath this bed, hard candy and they all got 
me to crawl under and get the candy for them, an
d I was caught.  I was caught.  You have no 
idea.  I was devastated.  I knew 
I did some thing bad.  It was deva
stating to me.  I was mortally

ashame d.  It's also while we were in Fublaines we
 also were enrolled in a public school there.  
And we didn't go very often, it seemed, but every m
onth or so we'd make this long trek, take two 
or three hours to walk and we'd sit at these 
desks and the ink bottle well was up here.  Do you 
reme mber?   You'd dip the pen and, yeah, so we had 
some  kind of learning, and also at the home.  
I wasn't  included in muc h of it because I was still one of the younger ones, but I love d learning 
so much I us ed to sneak in and listen.  If ever
 there was anything going on, I'd be there.  They 

were also teaching us about our religion and Hebrew studies and it 
wa s  onl y  for  t h e  ol de r  gi r ls ,  
but I always sneaked in with Miriam and I'd fa
ll asleep, but I reme mber because again I wanted 

to be special.  I wanted them to notice that I was there. 

 

 

02:39:41 

 

Q: At that point did you deci
ded you wanted to be Jewish? 
 

I: Well, it seemed like Miriam was, so it was okay, you know.  We were going to be 

together so it didn't ma tter anymore what, yeah, 
we did Š and I liked it, because we did have 
Shabbats and I know we always got a special dr
ess for Shabbat, which we then had to turn 
quickly in, because then we got 
whatever we wore for the whole week.  I reme mber vanity gets 
in my way too, because we would get shipme nts of
 clothing items from th
e States or wherever 
and there was these red shoes.  I had to have th
e red shoes.  I reme mbered sandals.  I reme mber 
these were with little holes in
 them, like a shoe sandal.  I had to have them.  So, whe n the 
children tried on the shoes I said, ﬁI want those s
hoes.ﬂ  They were too small for me  but I said, 
ﬁThey fit great.  I like them, I l
ove them, they'r e my shoes.ﬂ  And because of this, very shortly 
after that, we took a long walk into Paris, or 
went for a really long walk, and of course, you can 
imagine what happened to my feet.  I had blisters. 
 My feet were bleeding.  
I was in so much pain 
that the head mi stress had to actua
lly take me  in Paris to buy me  a pair of bigger shoes.  I got 
white.  I got white.  They weren't red, but okay, 
but they weren't brown.  I hated brown, and 
that's all that I had had before
.  My story with the shoes. 
 

 

Q: When you were in Poland with this woma n, 
Mrs. Mucha, you decided you didn't want to 
be Jewish, what was going through your mi nd? 

 

I: What was going through my mi nd is that I fe
lt to be Jewish was not a good thing.  People 

didn't like Jews and it was just much better to be
 Catholic because that
 was just what everybody 
was.  I wanted to be part of what
 everybody was Š and gee Š it was pretty. 
 

02:42:14 

 

R: I never knew that there was an option even fo
r this.  I sort of was always remi nded that I 
was Jewish and I accepted that.  And I knew I wa
sn't  liked, but I accepted it.  I did have though 
one in the very early stages when I first starte
d to go to school and they had these Catholic 
priests teach us the religion.  It seemed so very, 
so very pretty, the stat
ues and the rays going to 
the heads it seemed very nice and clean, and the 
Christma s also seemed very Š but some how I 
couldn't put it together  with what 
these people were really doing.  
I mean those same kids that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
32 
 
went to church with were waiting for me  on the outsi
de, so I just Š that wasn't  an option really.  
Just a hint  there that ma
ybe there's another way. 
 

 

Q: You then went to the United States on a boat? 

 

I: No, I came by plane.  It was terrifying 
because nobody had actually prepared me for a 
plane ride, and we came Š I came with Charlie
 and Miss Stutz (ph) or Š don't re me mber.  
Anyway, a young woma n who accompanied us and, we came Š that's  how we ca me  to New 

York.  The plane ride was horrifi
c.  I reme mber getting sick.  
I reme mber throwing up.  It was 
just Š there was no preparation.  I had no idea.  It was long, it was very long. 

 

 

Q: How old we re you at this time? 

 

I: So, I™m now Š it's 1947, I'm going to be 10. 

 

 

Q: So, you go to live with this Mr. Tenzer? 

 

I: I come  to the States and I get wined and 
dined.  We go to the White House.  We  visit 
President Truman and like, you got
 a celebrity sitting next to you. 
 

 

Q: You were kind of like a poster child in a way? 

 
I: Exactly right.  I was poster child.  I had these 
long curls.  I'm convin
ced to this day that's  
why he chose me .  He says he just fell in love
 with me , he says, but I was the only child with 
long hair, that's  the truth.  And I was kind of th
e poster child.  We were
 wined and dined.  We  
went to dinners.  We  wer e  on TV, 
early TV  We  were on the radio, and 
Lif e
 magazine did a full 
spread and a cover story and yes, they
 did raise thousands of dollars.   
 
02:45:30 

 

In the meantime, I was staying at Mr. Tenzer
's  home.  And we ll Š no, at the beginning we 
stayed at a posh hotel.  Wait a 
mi nute, we stayed at a hotel in
 New York City, and I reme mber 
getting served white bread for the first time and 
corn flake cereal, which 
I detest to this day, 
because Š what is this?  White bread, I didn™t Š 
and the photographers were taki ng pictur es, so 
they wanted us to look all excited about this, 
so I looked excited Š but 
I said ﬁI'm not eating 
this.ﬂ  So, and we went shopping in this big depa
rtment store.  I think 
it was Bonwit Teller™s, and 
I never seen anything like it in 
my whole life.  We got clothe
s and we got Š I got a stuffed 
animal, a bear, pink, ﬁCelesteﬂ I called it.  And then I just kind of Œ I got Š I wasn't  staying with 

Mr. Tenzer.  Charlie stayed 
with Mr. Tenzer.  I stayed 
with Bill and Eda Be ss Novick

also one of the founders of Rescue Children a
nd she had at that time  a little boy, David, and I 
think she was pregnant, and so I st
ayed with them and they enrolled me in the local yeshiva and I 
just wanted to know whe n I was going back to Fr
ance, and it seems that Mr. Tenzer arranged it 
so I would ne ver go back to France and I would 
just be staying here someplace and there was a 
fa mily who was interested in possibly adopting me  Š and t hey'll rema in name less Š so we had 
a trial, so they invited me for a weekend.  Th
ey had a daughter and a son and they wanted a 

playma te for their daughter I guess.  So, I came, a
nd I was very shy.  I was very quiet and I didn't 
know how to play game s.  I never played, and th
ey wanted me to play dolls and Monopoly.  I 
didn't know how to play anything, so I failed, and so 
after my visit with them
, they decided that I 
was not the right child, but that
 they would take Charlie inst
ead, because Charlie was very 
outgoing and he was funny and he had an impish smile and he had the dimples.  He was cute and 

he blabbed and he'd talk and I only wa nted to hide
 in the corner and disappear.  So they didn™t Š 
I was a reject, so I came back to Mr. Tenzer, but
 then I lucked out, because then Š I don't know 
quite how Š Mr. and Mrs. Meyer Sl
otkin were contacted, and they 
actually had sa
id they would 
be willing to adopt a child and th
ey wanted a boy actually.  They 
wanted Charlie.  Actually, that 
was the arrangeme nt.  This other family was going 
to get me and they we re going to get Charlie, 
but when Mr. Tenzer explained to
 them what happened, they said, 
ﬁNo problem, we 'll take her.ﬂ   
 

02:49:08 

 

They just took me  sight unseen.  I wa sn't  reject
ed.  And in the meanti me , Eda Bess Novick, when 
I staying with them, I had told her that I had 
a brother, so I think what happened is Re scue 
Children started ma king inquiries themselves 
about Š I remembered his name was René 
Guttmann.  I don't re member how I reme mbered that
, but I did, and to ma ke a very absolutely 
phenomenal story a little shorter, when Doctor Ka
lina had to flee to Israel was about the same  
time that 
Life
 ma gazine did a spread on me , and he picked up this 
Life
 ma gazine in Israel and he 
opened the page and he saw Irene Guttmann, and he sa
id, ﬁthat must be René's sister,ﬂ and that's 
really how Š. 

 

Q: How did they find you? 

 

I: Well, Doctor Kalina knew where he was. So, Doctor Kalina to
ld Rescue Children. 
 

R: Yes, I was with his sister. 

 

I: And that™s when I told Mr. and Mrs. Slotki
n Š they were thrilled, 
they said ﬁgreat.ﬂ  
Now they'r e  really happy, because they really wa
nted a boy for so long.  See, they just wanted 
you, René.  But they really spared no expense and 
it was a trek to get him.  I mean a lot of red 
tape.  A lot of governme nt officials had to be 
convinced the justice of
 this.  Money changed 
hands often and it took two years. 

 

R: It took a long time. 

 

 

Q: So, how did each of you find out th
at you were in a particular place? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
34 
 
I: We started writing once we Š Doctor Kalin
a notified us where René
 was, and I had an 
address for him.  I wrote him.  In fa ct, I still have
 the letter.  My mother ma de a copy of it at that 
time for me.  She took a photograph of it.  Some silly
 letter:  ﬁI go skating. 
 I'm a big girl now.ﬂ 
 
R: When I think about it today, these people fo
r two years searched and, believe me , it cost 
them, they told me  that when I got here finall
y in 1950, that I was actually
 worth my weight in 
gold, of course, gold wasn't  as dear as it is toda
y, but still I believe them, because for two years 
they searched.  They sent a ma n, a pr
ivate person just to go out there Š. 
 

I: Because René was behind the iron curtain 
now and it took some  doing be cause he had to 
go Š Switzerland, he had to go to school there.  
He had a good time.  He  skied, he learned how 
to do all nice things. 

 

R: I really lucked out on this. 
 I was in Pa ris, in the Grand Hotel.  They would Š I would go 
to see movies, English movies because in preparation getting the language. 

 

02:52:29 

 

I: Notbad. 

 

R: It was very good. 

 

I: I was struggling w
ith school and stuff. 
 

R: I saw Elizabeth Taylor  in the original  Black
 Beauty.  I me an, I reme mber her blue eyes 
and dark skin.  I thought she was ma gnificent.  
She was very young then Œ it was a real girl.  
Some  of the cowboys, Tom Mix.   

 

I: LoneRanger. 

 

R: That™s much later Š this is in Europe.  
The Abbot and Costello movies, these was what 
was being shown then, and I was made to go and s
ee these, so I would ca
tch on to the English. 
 

I: Tough life he had. 

 

R: Then they sent me  to school in Switzerland wh
ere I learned Hebrew and to ski.  It wasn't  
the purpose.  The purpose was Š  They couldn't 
some how get through the red tape to get me  
over. 

 

Q: Were the Mann fa mily upset in some  way? 

 

I: They were in some  ways Š I think Mrs. Ma
nn really liked me.  I fe
lt that.  I never knew 
what it's like to love a mother or a father, no
t even the Slotkins, even though they'r e angels, 
because I realize now what they ha d done.  It's 
only when you grow a lot older that you realize 
that here was this family, the Slotkins, and 
they took an unknown 12 year old boy, I mean, think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
35 
 
about it, with certainly not a gr
eat background.  Certainly questionabl
e, a little bit, to just bring 
him and adopt him.  It was like an unbelie
vable thing to do, but Irene paved the way. 
 
I: I paved the way.  They loved me  
Œ t hey figured you had to be right. 
 

 

Q: Did you write to each ot he r in Czech, German?  

 

R: I wrote in Czech and I think it was translated. 

 

I: Then, he started writing simple English. 

 

Q: Tell us about the day you me t. 

 

R: It was March 29, 1950.  I landed at 
Idlewild Airport with Mr. Enright
11
.  It was a mi sty 
night.  Did we
?   It was my mother that came to pick us
 up, my father wasn't  out there.  I call 
them mother and father, because they'r e the 
only ones that I knew.  He was out of town 
some where, but we came  in, we came  to the house.  
I think it was so late at
 night that we didn't 
see.  I don't reme mber seeing you that night.  I thi
nk we just went to sleep.  They gave us their 
bedroom, the master bedroom of the house, Mr. 
Enright and myself had that, and I don't know 
where the rest of them were.  
But I reme mber seeing you first in 
the morning on that path in the 
front of the house.  That's my first recollection of seeing you, meeting you. 

 

02:55:32 

 

I: Yes, I reme mber it was the front. 

 

R: In the front of the house.  And to me  it wa
s like when I saw her in Auschwitz, the look, 
didn't say a word. 

 

I: Not a word.  We  didn't s a y anything, we just Š  

R: But okay, now it's all right. 

 

I: People are always surprised.  They expect that
 fi re works went  off, 
but it was not like that 
at all.  It was just
 
 

R: Very long trip. 

 

I: But we never spoke about anything that ha
ppened.  We just became very American Š 
like that. 

 

R: I was even in the American Army, woul
d you believe.  The National Guard, Fort Dix Š

that's where I had my ba sic training.  Peopl
e told me  that I wa
s really nuts, but Š

I: When I went to school here, I went to ye
shiva and I also even 
here I was ashame d of 
what had happened to me, because they never ta
ught anythi ng about the Holocaust and I had the 
number and I always wanted to hide it, so 
my mo m did get makeup and everyŠ anytime in the 
summer or spring when I was wearing short sleeves
, we would doctor it up in the morning, take 
an extra ten mi nutes of my life in the morni
ng to do, because I didn't want anybody to know that 
I had been in this, because I felt that it was some
thing to be ashame d of.  And I reme mber once a 
teacher asking me  Š and this was already I was in high school Š and he asked me  this question, 
he said to me, ﬁIf everybody in this country were
 to vote that we should 
kill all the Jews would 
that still be a democracy? ﬂ   He's asking me , me  of
 all the children in th
at school, so I guess what 
I'm trying to say is there was very little sens
itivity and, even among teachers or my classmates, 
people just didn't know what to do w
ith it.  I was the only child surv
ivor that they had ever seen 
that was in that school and, of course until René
 came, and they just Š I reme mber history and 
nothing.  Never talked about this.  So, I was ashame
d to talk about it too, plus that our parents 
said, ﬁforget about it, this is a new life, be Amer
ican,ﬂ and I already had 
learned to fit in, so I 
knew how to do that.  I became very American, right? 

 

R: So did I.  It was time to be drafted or jo
in, I chose to join, but 
they told me, ﬁYou'll get 
off, just tell them what you are.  You can't  be ne
ar guns, near war.  You've
 had it.  I didn't  feel 
that, I really had the fear.ﬂ  So
 I said, ﬁNo, I'll have to go throu
gh it,ﬂ and I did.  Of course, I took 
lot of abuse, again in the army, because of th
e number.  Total ignorance.  They people didn't 

know and this I'm talking about 1960, about 1960. Not so far away from the war and you'd think 

that people would know, but
 totally insensitive.

Q: Irene, if we can just go back for a mo me
nt, when you were with Mrs. Mucha, she did 
some thing very bizarre with you.  Can you describe it? 

 

I: Yes.  Every once in a while she would take 
me, I didn™t really realize where at the time, 
but we would sift through ashes looking for gold 
teeth, and I realized that
 the surroundings were 
kind of fa mi liar when I got there.  I guess she was taking me  back to Auschwitz-Birkenau and 

we were looking for gold teeth.  And by this time
, I understood that a lot of
 people had died here 
and had been set ablaze here.  And it was a very
 difficult thing for me  to do but Œ and I had Š 
she insisted that I do this.  I had 
to come  up with some  gold teeth. 
 

Q: So, she didn't shift through it? 

 

I: She also sifted.  We  both did. 

 

Q: And if you didn't come  up with gold teeth? 

 

I: I had to come  up with gold teeth. 

 

Q: And this was more than once? 

 

I: Yes. 

 
Q: You were talking, René, about 
being in the National Guard? 
 
R: Yeah.  I joined the National Guard in th
e early 60s, ma ybe even '59 it was.  I don't 
reme mber exactly.  I was an observant Jew 
and I saw nothing wrong w
ith it.  I saw nothing 
wrong with having my a r m bared, which was ma ny times.  There I reme mber the showers very 

clearly. The army showe r s.  I had my head shave
d, it was really funny, now th
at I think about it.  
I was surprised that it was only like a decade or
 so after the war, the World War II and the 
ignorance of the people when they saw my ar m. They were like, ﬁIt's your phone number, it's  
your social security number?   Is it your
ﬂ they really had no idea. 
 And then, coupled with my 
wearing a hat or a yarmulke in the mess hall, an
d usually carrying my own food in or asking for 
certain food to be prepared.  I wa
s surprised at the negative feeli
ngs that I got.  We ll, ma ybe it's 
the wrong word, surprised.  That's the way it's b
een all my life all over
, but I thought, ﬁIn the 
army Š the American Army, we'r e s haring some thing.ﬂ  I was such a good soldier.  A 
marks man, my company commander 
was very proud of me .  I was his only Jew, but I was the 
best, so, but it was surprising, that
 so shortly after the war, th
ere was still ignorance and these 
negative feelings about Jews. 

 

03:04:38 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320

Q: When they asked you, ﬁIs this your telephone number?ﬂ I me an, clearly you said ﬁno,ﬂ 
but did you say Š? 

 

R: I told them what it was.  
I said Š I explored it with them
 Œ ﬁYou really don't know what 
this is? ﬂ  and they didn't.  Then, I told them, and th
ey still weren't quite sure what to ma ke of that.  
ﬁ Was it a Jewish symbol ?   Did it ma ke you a Je
w? ﬂ  I said, ﬁNo, this 
is man's symbol of 
inhumanity to another ma n.  Tattooing instead of
 giving me  a name , giving me  a number.ﬂ  You 
know, I tried to explain it.  Some  got it, some  didn't. 

 

Q: Tell me  something.  At this
 point, in the 60s, what did you 
know about where you were at 
that time in the 40s?   Did you know it was Auschwitz? 

 

R: Yeah, but that's as much as I knew and that
's as much as I care to know, and that's as 
much as I discussed with Irene.  We  never talked about it.  We knew where we came from and 

that was enough. 

 

Q: So, you went into the National Guard after high school? 

 

R: Pretty much, yeah.  It was college really. 

 

Q: Wa s this like  ROTC? 

 

R: No, it was not a continuous Š I did go into 
ROTC, but I cut out of their program and that 
would have led me  into a two year stint and I wasn't
 ready for it.  I went on 
to college, after I was 
married. 

 
Q: Did you go to school, Irene? 
 

I: Yes. 

 

Q: You studied biochemi stry, you said? 

 

I: Right, right.  I am a biochemi st.  I never 
spoke about the Holocaust, 
because I Š as I said 
Š I had this feeling that nobody ever
 really wanted to hear about 
it.  Also, our parents kind of 
told us, you know, ﬁit™s best,ﬂ and what was 
everybody™s feeling, ﬁYou were young, forget about 
it.  You've got a new life, and just, you know, put
 the past out of your mi nds.ﬂ  In a wa y, I did 
that.  I listened.  I said, ﬁOkay, 
great.  I'm American.  I'll put it out
 of my mi nd.ﬂ  But, in a way, I 
was suffering twice.  I ha d already suffered, and now I was suffering, because I coul dn't  even 

talk about it.  It ma de me  feel like ma ybe th
ere was some thing to really be ashame d about, 
because nobody wanted to know about it.  And as I went through high school, I reme mber the 

Holocaust wa s not even me ntioned.  We learned 
the world history.  We  learned about World Wa r 
II, but Š and this was a yeshiva!  So, it was pretty frightening to me , I Š and then when I got to 

college, it wa s pretty mu ch the same  thing.  I fo
und that my friends knew 
very little about the 
Holocaust.  Nobody spoke about it. 
 There weren't any programs ye
t, and I really Š it just 
reconfirme d for me  that it was some thing that 
I need to be ashame d of and I don't want anybody 
to know that I am a survivor. But then, when I got a little braver, and th
ey started having some  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
39 
 
Holocaust reunions, I kind of would venture fo
rth and say, ﬁI am a su
rvivors.ﬂ  From the 
survivors I got, ﬁYou can't  be, you're too young.  Coul
dn't be.  Children didn't survive.  They said 
where were you? ﬂ  I said ﬁAusch
witz-Birkenau.  Couldn't be.  Ch
ildren didn't survive.ﬂ  I said, 
ﬁBut I and my brother did.  We  did.ﬂ  ﬁNo, you ha
ve it mi xed up.ﬂ  So, another negative.  So, I 
stopped, I kind of stopped talking ab
out it.  I didn't  say anything. 
 I think my kids knew, my 
husband knew that I was a survivor, but I thi
nk the floodgates broke l
oose in 1985 and friends 
who had known me  for years, who hadn't had a 
clue that I was a survivor, were shocked. 
 
03:08:59 

 

Q: They didn't see your tattoo? 

 

I: Right, because I always hid it.  I hid it.  
I wore long sleeves.  I wore long sleeves, I wore 
Band-Aids.  René never did.  René always show
ed it clearly, and after 
a while, I also stopped 
covering it up, but I reme mber in particular when
 I gave birth to my daughter Lori, a nurse came 
into my room and she saw my number and she ran 
out terrified.  She thought
 I was a prisoner, an 
escaped prisoner, 1965. 

 

Q: Did you folks read 
Diary of Anne Frank
, when it came  out? 
 

I: Yes, I did. 

 

R: Ididn't. 

 

Q: That's  in the 50s, right? 

 
I: Yes. 
 

Q: Did that provoke some thing in you? 

 

I: Yes.  I was very moved and touched by it,
 but I couldn't quite Š I'm searching for the 
right word.  I didn't connect to it.
  Her story was so very differe
nt.  And in some  ways, I thought 
it was better, you know.  At least she had her fam
ily and so they were in hiding and however 
horrible that was, at least they 
had each other for a long time .  So
 
 

  

Q: Do you know that she we nt to Auschwitz from that book? 

 

I: No. 

 

R: I found it yesterday in th
e Museum's  archives, in the Auschwitz Chronicles. 
 

I: I found out sooner than that, but I didn't
 from that book realize that she had been. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
40 
 
R: Can I backtrack just once?   It
 just came to mi nd that this l
oneliness that  we talked about.  
When twins were in Auschwitz and they had thei
r own sex partner with them, there Š they had 
some body with them.  We were separate because 
of our sex difference, so this ma de it Š 
I: It added to the isolation. 
 

R: Do you remember seeing girl twins together? 

 

I: Oh, sure.  I was jealous.  I was jealous 
of them because I felt they had somebody and I 
had nobody.  That's why I was always hiding andŠ 

 

03:11:35 

 

Q: So, they never kept the boys 
and the girls together , the twins? 
 

I: I don't think so.  I think 
ma ybe younger ones possibly, butŠ 
 

R: I don't think there were any.  I don't know. 

 

Q: Did you talk with your kids? 

 

I: No.  I did make an attempt.  At one time,
 I was actually at my mom's hous e and Lori wa s 
asking me  about my number and 
I was trying to tell her that 
it was some thing horrible that 
happened and that I'm adopted and my mother got
 very upset.  She said, ﬁYou don't have to tell 
her these things.ﬂ 

 

R: The Slotkins, in all their good qualities and 
beautiful intentions, th
ey slipped up over here 
a little bit.  They were a little ov
er protective, I think.  They really
 tried to hide the truth, in a way 
of protecting us, really.  I don't th
ink they had anything else in mi nd. 
 

I: But it backfired, because the more they sa
id don't talk about it, the more it was still 
always there, because it's always with me  and not 
being able to express it or
 tell or share any of it 
wa s  r e a l l y  ha r d . 

 

Q: Let me  go back for a mo me nt.  When you saw each other for the first time, when you 

were finally together, even though you didn't 
talk, did that stimulate nightmares or 

reme mbrances or bad dreams that you woke up from?   I mean do you have any recollection 

whether there was some t hing that happened ot
her than safety when you found each other? 
 

I: For me , I ha d some  of the reme mbrances we spoke about when we were children.  And 

so, when I saw him, ﬁ N ow I have finally have so
me body I can check some  of this stuff out with.ﬂ  
I think we did check some of that pre stuff out th
at we never spoke about after Theresienstadt.  It 
was only what happened before.  That's  how we 
s poke about the doll and about the bee sting and 

a couple of things like that.  
So, that was nice to confirm.  
 

Q: So, it didn't bring out Š?

I: No.

Q: Now, did you become  a teacher when you studied biochemi stry? 

 

I: No, I went into research, but
 I did teach for a while, too. 
 

Q: So what happens in the 80s? 

 

I: Well, in 1985, it was probably in December we got a call fr om Eva Kor
12
 who was the 
founder and rema ins the president of an or
ganization called CANDL ES, which stands for 
Children of Auschwitz Nazi D
eadly Lab Experime nt Survivors, it's a mo uthful, God!  
CANDLES.  And she told us that they'r e going to
 have a reunion, a first time  reunion of all 
surviving twins in Israel , and that we were 
going to bring Joseph Mengele in absentia to a 
tribunal and Gideon Hausner
13
 was going to chair it and are you going to come ?   We  we re just 
Šas I said before, I said, ﬁYou mean we'r e not th
e only children to surv
ive Auschwitz?ﬂ  But it 
was a drawing card, I think, for René and myself
.  For me, I had a tremendous need to find 
some body who knew me .  I wanted to be affirm
e d in some  way.  ﬁOh please, let me  Š 
some body knows me , so they can tell me  what ex
actly happened.  And are my me mor i es, they'r e 
so bizarre, can they be real? ﬂ   And so, we d
ecided we'd do it.  And, you know, it's in retrospect 
now, because we did that and we started talking 
to each other and heard so me  of the other twins 
and some of their testimonies a
nd it was like, ﬁAh-ha, that's what happened to me !ﬂ  You know, 
we realized that our me mories were true, as bi
zarre as they mi ght be, they really happened, and 
subsequently, we were able to research out a lo
t of our past, because we
 started looking into 
history books and original documentati
on from Auschwitz and Givat Chaim
14
 in Israel, we 
started piecing together dates and 
occurrences.  We were also very
 fortunate to have a lot of 
photographs that were saved by our aunt for us an
d letters and documentati
ons, birth certificates 
and such.  So, it's wonderful. 

 

R: It's like finding roots.  Roots is 
very important in American history. 

 

 

Q: Were you as surprised as Ire
ne that there were other ch
ildren?  Or did you know there 
were?

R: That didn't play such an important part beca
use I didn't need Š I didn't feel like I had to 
be okay by anybody. I was okay.  I wa s surprised though when I saw the numbers.  And there 
must have been about 100. 

 

I: Right, about 120. 

 

03:17:24 

 

R: One hundred and twenty from all over the 
world, and some  of the stories we've heard 
were more bizarre than even ours, believe me . 
 Some  of the stories Š because I think older 
people Š most of the people are older Š one hundred percent of them were older than us, and 

they were more caught up in this thing emotiona
lly.  That's my own private theory, that when 
you're older, your emotions are hurt much more. 
 You have more understanding of what's  really 
going on, so you were hurt more.  And the stories th
at they told with the emotions behind them 
were really, really Œ but I don't know, Ire
ne, you never find anybody who recognized you? 
 

I: No, I was the one who was looking forsome body to recognize me .  But againŠ  

 

R: I was recognized by people.  I didn't rec
ognize them, but they recognized me , so I must 
have ma de an impression on some body, which was okay with me . 

 

 

Q: What did that do?   I mean, it's clear 
what it did for you probably together and for 
yourself, but when you came back to the United St ates in terms of your friends, in terms of your 

parents? 

 
I: Well, our dad was already 
dead, and my mo m, we starte
d Š I started giving talks on 
Yo m Ha-Sh oah
15
.  It's one of the things I still do.  And we were in the ne ws me dia a lot at that  
time, and I think my mom was kind of proud, but she 
didn't want to hear it.  She's never come  to 
hear me  talk.  She never came.  She 's  dead now, but she never came, and she never wanted to 
hear about it.  I could not talk to 
her about it at all, absolutely not. 
 

Q: Did that hurt you? 

 

I: It's  hard, yes. 

 

R: Yeah, it's hard, because here is some
body who certainly love s you and wants to do 
absolutely the best, and yet some how doesn't  have
 enough strength or wisdom to be s e nsitive to 
understand that this other person ha
s to express or wants to Š I mean, we really didn't want to 
go and spill our guts out, just a littl
e bit.  I think maybe part of it 
was that  she really wanted to 
play the mother role.  She was the only mother. 
 She was afraid of ma ybe losing that.  I'm just 
talking now.  We  don't  know, we really don't know
.  But her motivation was pure, I know that, 
absolutely pure.

Q: Did it shock your friends? 

 

I: I had some  friends who were totally taken 
aback, they said, ﬁBut you're so American.  
You don't talk like a European.  You don't look li
ke, you know.ﬂ  And Š but the truth of it is, 
that even though I'm so "American," because I knew
 how to fit in, the trut h is that everything I 
did and everything I excelled at, 
whether it was in school or bei
ng, I mean, I made my parents Œ 
right, I was the salutatorian of
 the class, the editor of the 
newspaper, the yearbook, the Š you 
name  it, I did it Š but always there was that feel
ing like I was apart.  I 
never Š never felt a part 
of anything.  There was always a wall some place.
  I said, ﬁYou guys don't know what I know.ﬂ  
And I reme mber when I first even started school he
re. I reme mber the kids would talk out of turn 

in class or they didn't bring in
 the home work and I said, ﬁMy God, how can you do that? ﬂ   I said, 
ﬁHow can you do that?ﬂ 

 

Q: You were a good girl? 

 

R: Just generally, I think the European school sy
stem is so different.  I reme mber, I used to, 

other than the unpleasant things, I used to have
 to bring my own stic
k to school, in case I 
mi sbehaved and get hit on my hands.  So, there wa s th
is big theory to get a very thin stick, then it 
will really sting, or get a fa
t stick, and it will really hurt.  This was a big problem. 
 

Q: Were you in classes t
ogether through high school? 
 

R: Yes, through high school. 

 

I: In our English classes we were toge
ther, but in Hebrew we were separated. 
 

Q: Was that fun to be in school together? 

 

I: No. 

 

R: No. 

 

I: No, it wasn™t. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

R: The class was really too small.  I think 
there were only 11 of us, because this was the 
beginning of a school there, we were
 always the eldest Œ we we re se
nior class in yeshiva, right.  
Even if we were juniors or s
ophomores or freshmen, we we re al
ways the oldest.  There were Š 
nobody older than us, so it was too close. 

 

I: It was too close.  We  weren't the same  kind of student. 

 

R: She was a student, I was a playboy. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320

I: And, you know, very often, he'd be compared to
 me and I didn't like that, because I really 
wanted to be like him. 
 I thought it was nifty. 
 
R: And Father thought I should be just like you, a student. 

 

I: So there you go. 

 

03:23:20 

 

Q: What did you end up doing Š since 
we know what Irene ended up doing? 
 

R: I ended up getting ma rried early and out of the house, ma king a mi stake doing that, I 

think, but as God's ways are so st
range, everything I've done in my life has led up to what we'r e 
on now.  And I can see the whole picture now and it'
s not so bad.  I paid my dues, but I have the 
most wonderful wife in the world, the wonderful wi
fe, the best, and I have the best kids and the 
best grandchildren, so I'm happy. 

 

 

Q: What did you do for a living? 

 

I: I worked in the packaging fi
eld all my life.  Packaging. 

 

Q: Do the two of you live near each other? 

 

I: Relatively, I live on Long Island, he lives in 
Manhattan.  And I also have the best family, 
René.  So, you know, I have the best kids too.  I 
don't have any grandkids 
yet, but I definitely 
have the best  great-gr and whatever they are to me. 

 

Q: Right, René was just ma
de a grandfather twice? 
 

R: Last week, right. 

 

I: I also do calligraphy and write poetry. 

 

R: She's very talented. 

 
I: I don't know if I'm talented, but
 
 
R: What this '85 thing also did for us, it ma de
 the two of us talk.  Not during any session at 
home , we would not talk about it.  Like in be
tween sessions in the hotel
 room, we would talk 
about it, and that's the only time we talk about 
it.  We 'll go home now and we'r e not going to talk 

about this, but we talked about it 
a little bit this morning or last
 night on the way to the airport, 
and that's it. It's just something 
that is not really, I guess Š it's 
not pleasant.  It's  unnerving.  It 
takes a lot out of, out of you, but we've done it now 
since '85.  We 've talked because we feel it's 
really necessary, and the further we go away fr
om it, the mo re necessa
ry, I think, it become s 
because we see a lot of funny things going on out th
ere, in terms of did it 
really happen?   Did it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0320  
45 
 
not happen?   What really happened?
  We 'll change  a little bit of 
this and a little bit of that and 
that's very, very harmful and dangerous. 
 

03:26:14 

 

Q: Is there anything more you'd like to say? 

 

I: I'm going to say that this has been painful for me  to do, even though René says we've 

been doing it now since '85.  I, I'm always distur
bed for days on end after I've done it, but I agree 
with René that it's some thing that we need to
 do for our children, so that they can pass on the 
story, because it must never be forgo
tten, and I guess that's why I do it. 
 

R: I have to say again that 
what's happening today, we are 
meeting up with people that are 
using the story for their own purpose and, obviousl
y, if they'r e using a story that's  not true, 
they'r e changing it.  That is we can't  stand by, as 
hurtful as it is to ques
tion a survivor, because I 
know when somebody a sks me a question, it's got to 
be done. It's  got to be done to pollute the 
history of something like this, it™ll lose a
ny potential for learning some thing from it. 

 

I: Well, the historical integrity of the Holocau
st mu st really be upheld and it's  got to be 
done with the truth. 

 

R: And I think more people when they put so
me body in the front or recognize by whatever 
slight means, survivor, I thi
nk at this point have to ques
tion and document that person. 
 

 

Q: Well, I thank you very much.  You s
howed your tattoo, woul d you be willing to 
photograph your tattoo?   
What's the number? 
 

I: 70917. 

 

R: That's an old looking tattoo. 

 

I: It's 50 years old, baby. 

 

Q: Yours is mu ch smaller? 

 

R: No, not really. 

 

Q: Yours is 169061. 

 

03:29:36 

 

I: We 've been trying to find out what my 
mo m's number mi ght have been.  We didn't fi nd 
out yet. 

 

R: We suspect it was probably clos
e to that number, but we don't know.

I: Okay, the photo on the left is my mo m with 
René and myself.  René is on the right and I 
am on the left, and I think it was shortly afte
r we were born.  It's probably 1938.  The photo on 
the right is again René and myself with my dad, a
nd it's about the same time.  René is on the left  

and I'm on t he right with my dad, because René ha s the droopy eyes.  It's 1939 and we'r e wearing 

our nifty winter jackets.
  René is on the right and I'm on the 
left.  It's 1941 and we'r e practically 
all grown up and it's winter and we'r e wearing our ha
rnesses with bells.  It's  the summer of '41, 
it's our last picture with our father and we'r e in 
the park.  This is a pr
ofessional photograph taken 
in Theresienstadt with our mo m and it's the last picture we ev
er took with her. 
 

R: Just want to add that it'
s the only time  I ever reme mber touching her, feeling what it 
really felt like, so this pict
ure is very, ve
ry special. 
 

Q: This was in 1942. 

 

I: It's April 1950 and this is where René and I saw each other for the first time since the 

war.  It's our home  in America a
nd the front walk is where we  me t.
