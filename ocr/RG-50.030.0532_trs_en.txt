Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 interview 
conducted by 
Peggy Frankston
, with Mrs. 
Lucie Ragin
, on July 23
rd
, 2009, in 
New York City
, for the 
Rivesaltes 
Internment Camp Memo
rial Museum. Good 
mo rn ing  Mrs. 
Ragin
. 
Answer: Yes, ma  Œ good mo rn ing. My name is 
Lucie Ragin
, I was born 
Lucie 
Laya
(ph)
 Sa ltz
, and my parents felt that 
Za l c
, 
z-a - l-c
, but 
Saltz, s-a-l-t-z
 is also 
how it™s spelled. And I was born in 
Antwerp, Belgium
, February  27, 1935. And my  
mother and father were very lovi
ng parents. My father™s name was 
David Saltz
, 
an d  my  moth er™s n ame  was 
Miriam Clara Sa ltz
. And they already had a son, his 
name is 
Andre Za lc
, 
Abra ham Za lc
. And we were a very
 happy family, and 
Antwerp
 is a beautiful ci Œ city by Œ by the 
ocean. And my  aunt and uncle lived in 
the same to wn in a ver Œ in a Jewish co
mmunity there, we lived. And my  aunt and 
uncle had a bakery. And that™s the only family
 we really had. Most of my father™s 
family was in 
Poland
, and my mother had some family left in 
Latvia, Russia
, and 
Œ wh ich we never met, but we were very cl
ose to my family, my mother™s aunt and 
uncle Œ ma Œ my  aunt and uncle, and I alwa
ys would go th ere as 
a little girl and on 
the holid ays and we Œ my  mo ther and Œ woul
d make wine with her sister, and I Œ I 
loved the goodies in the bakery  that they owned, so I always liked to go there. And

we were very happy family and all of a s
udden they said it woul
dn™t be good for the 
Jewish people to stay in 
Antwerp
 because the war was broke Œ breaking out. So my  
parents and my  aunt and uncle, we decided to leave 
Antwerp
, and we packed 
whatever we could in a Œ in 
a rush to leave, and Œ for 
France
. And I was a little girl, 
I really didn™t understand too much. I saw 
people taping the window, because they 
were afraid that their houses would be bom
bed, and they put tape on the window so 
it wouldn™t shatter. And we took a duffle ba
g, whatever we coul
d, and we left by 
train to go to  
France
. And I remember the Re
d Cross in the Œ in 
La Ga re
, in the 
station, and they would help all the people
 and give them hot chocolate and things 
like that. And when they
 packed in a rush, one of the 
scissors that t h
ey packed was 
sticking up, and I sat on that bag, and I 
had to  be treated by the Red Cross, and 
that™s why I remember that incident. And 
the train went on, and we really didn™t 
know wh ere we were going in
 France
, and we went towards this Œ I guess on the Œ 
the southern part of 
France
, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all i-in a 
place called 
Brens
(ph), which was a camp. And 
from there we went to 
Recebedou
, 
or vice-versa. And then  we ended up in 
Rivesaltes
, which was the worst one, I 
think, of them all. I remember barbed 
wire, but I don™t remember Œ I think I was 
wearing a Jewish star, but 
I™m not positive. I was a little 
girl, and my mother was 
pregnant, and it was very hard fo r her be cause we didn™t have any fo od, and we

didn™t have many things. And whatever sh
e had, she would give to her children. 
And I rem Œ and my father in camp, he™s Œ 
he knew Œ he was a plumber there, they 
used him to do plumbing, and 
he helped people get out of
 the camp, and they paid 
him by giving him like an egg, a to mato, 
a few potatoes and this way he would 
make his food. But they  were aware of what
 he was doing, so 
he had to leave the 
camp and not come back. He had to leave 
my  mo ther and me there and not come 
back, because there were Œ and every day th ey  would come and they would pick  up 
my mother, I don™t know if it was the 
Vichy
. I remember a German Shepherd also, 
and they  would take my  mo ther for ques
tioning, because they thought she knew  
where he was, but she didn™t. And I Œ I used
 to see my cousin in camp, and my aunt. 
I don™t rememb er about my  uncle and my  
boy cousin. But we were very hungry, 
very, very  hungry. There was 
hardly any fo od. I know my  mo ther always said if you 
got like a hundred grams of bread and a little 
bit of turnip soup a
nd if they punished 
you, they  would take it away from you. 
That™s what she said. And Œ and she was 
always worried about everybody. And I reme
mber in the camp, th
ey put me in the 
little children™s nursery, or whatever, and 
I would Œ I was alwa
ys crying Œ they 
called me Œ  I was always crying, I was always sad, I was a very sad little girl 
because I always wanted to 
be with my mother. And I ev
en had the German measles 
there, and they put me in the infirmary.
 And I had the window by Œ I slept by the

window in the infirmary, and there were
 other children there, and the mo thers 
would co me by the window and they wanted 
to give things for their children, and I 
would Œ I know I wasn™t allowed to take it, 
but they like more or 
less forced me to 
do it. And th en they  took me away  from by
 the window so I couldn™t see anybody. 
And we were there, and also I was in 
a little nursery where I cried all the time 
because I wanted to be w
ith my mother. And one day 
I escaped when the milkman 
came, and I ho Œ I heard all the loudspeaker
s talking, you know, listening to my  
name, and Œ and somehow I thought I woul
d find my mother, but all the barracks 
looked alike, and I couldn™t find her. So so
mebody recognized me
 and th ey took me 
to my  mo ther and somehow she mu st have 
convinced them Œ conv
inced them to let 
me stay there. And Œ but I 
know everybody was 
very, very hungry
, and there was a 
lot of suffering all around me. My girl cous
in was very close to me and I would see 
her once in a while, but she was older and you know, th ey divided you by age. The 

rabbi in the camp heard that they
 were going to send ev erybody to  
Auschwitz
, so  he 
told my mother to try to 
escape. My brother had Œ and 
my father were no longer 
there. We didn™t know where they  were. You 
have to rememb er that in those days 

there was no radio, no communication from 
the outside, nothing. So you really 
didn™t know what was going on. After the 
war we found out that my brother was 
given away to a French family. But the ra
bbi gave my  mo ther a few francs and told

her to escape. So we had a pass to see 
my  sister, who was born at the maternity 
[indecipherable]
. And instead of going to  see her, we escaped. An d my  mo ther had 
spoken to one of the 
nurses there and she said not to
 worry, that she™s gonna try and 
get her out of camp. My mo ther was unbelie
vable, very strong lady, very strong, 
that she could survive all of 
this. And with a few francs we
 went Œ we didn™t go to 
see my  si st er, my  mo t h
er took me to the 
La Gare
, which is the railroad station. And 
she tried to buy tickets for us, she just ha
d en ough money to buy 
us tickets to go to 
Marseilles
. And in 
Marseilles
, sh e knew my father woul
d be there. There was a 
hotel where all the Jew ish people stay
ed, and she figured somebody th ere would 
know where my father was. So Œ but at 
the station, I started to cry and sh e was 
afraid that the Germans would Œ because
 you had to sh ow a pass wherever you 
went, so she was afraid that the Germans 
would notice me crying, so she bought me 
soda. I wanted soda to keep me quiet. 
So when she went to buy the ticket, the 
money th at she used for the soda, she didn
™t have enough for the tickets. So she met 
a woman there that she™s a French lady, an
d she sold her Œ she had a piece of soap, 
and she sold  her the piece of soap and th
e lady and my mother
 bought the tickets 
and she to ok us on the train and spoke fo
r my mother, cause my
 mo ther only sp oke 
Yiddish and very little French
, and they used to come 
on the train to ask for 
identity. But my mother made 
believe like she was sleeping,
 and I was a little girl, I

spoke a little French, so
 that was all right, and the woman took care of me. But the 
minute we arrived in 
Marseilles
,  she Œ she told my moth
er, I can no longer stay 
with Œ with you, because Œ she kissed us go
odbye and she left us right there. So we 
didn™t know really where to find my fa
ther, but we knew there was a place in 
Marseilles
 called 
Hotel Avant
(ph). I don™t know exactly 
how sh e found that out, 
but we tried to go there and I was afraid 
of anybody that wore a uniform, so my 
mo ther was going to  stop, she saw a mailman,
 and ask him. And I carried on so that 
she couldn™t even ask him, but somehow 
she did after a while, and we found a 
place, 
Hotel Avant
(ph) in 
Marseilles
, where all the Jewish pe
ople were assembled. 
But it wasn™t a very good place to stay, 
because the Germans would come with big 
trucks and they would raffle 
Œ they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to  
Auschwitz
. So we were in that hotel, it™s lik
e a miracle. My father™s friend was 
there, and he said he hasn™t seen my 
father for a while. So
meti mes h e  co mes in  
there, but he hasn™t seen him for a while. 
But th at night we went to sleep and my 
father cut his finger while he was Œ he wa
s a lumb erjack during 
the war, in th Œ in 
the forest, that™s what he said. And he cu
t his finger, this finge
r here, the pointer. I 
always remember, because he had a big sca
r. And he had to see a doctor because the 
bleeding wouldn™t stop. So  he Œ he came in
 to see the doctor and my father™s friend 
said, you know, Mr. 
Za l c
, your wife and daughter are 
here. He said, come on, don™t

joke around, it™s impossible. So it just turned
 out that that™s what happened. So in 
the morning we saw my father and it was 
the most exciting time. I™m sorry. And my 
father went to suture Œ oh, my father went 
to the doctor to suture his wound, and my  
mother like almost collapsed 
because my  brother wasn™t with him. My brother and 
father, in the beginning they were like homel ess people. But then my father saw that 
he couldn™t take care of my  brother, so 
he gave him away to a French fa-family. 
And they  took very good care 
o f  h i m. S o  my mo th er sa
id she™s not leaving unless 
he gets my brother, so it took a Œ well, we 
went to this vil Œ little village which is 
called 
Aix-en-Provence
 and from there we went with my father to 
Tres
, which was 
in the southern part of 
France
, where he was living. And the landlady, Madame 
Laville
(ph), she was the landlady where my  fath
er lived, and she gave us a bigger 
room, and my  broth Œ my  father got my  
brother back from the French people, and 
we all lived in that room: 
my mother, my father, my brother and me. And my sister 
was still at 
Erna
(ph). So the French lady was a wo
nderful, wonderful lady and she 
didn™t like the Germans becau
se they killed her son du
ring the war, whatever. And 
she would take me with her all over. She 
would take me to the cemetery, she would 
take me to church . So she wanted to rea
lly baptize me. And sh e gave us like food, 
and she gave us Œ and she let us live ther
e all through th e war without paying rent. 
We all lived in a big room that looked like a restaurant, all of us. And th e Germans,

when they came to town
, lived upstairs in that hotel. 
And they didn™t know we were 
Jewish, so that™s another miracle. I mean, 
it™s Œ it™s incredible. So we had a little car 
Œ and then , the 
Ozay
(ph), or the Red Cross, the Swi
ss Red Cross got my sist er out 
of concentration camp Œ out of the internme
nt camp  and they brought her to us, to 
my  mo th er. And  my  mo th er h a
d to go to meet her in 
Marseilles
, an d on the way 
back they  didn™t like her pass Œ you know, th
ey came to see, this one, to see if 
everything was all right, and they Œ they
 almost didn™t let her get off the bus, 
because they didn™t like the papers. It didn™
t have some kind of signature, and the 
bus driver said, come on, let™s Œ let her 
go, you know, and then
 he took off, and she 
came to 
Trespeux
(ph)
 Giraud
(ph), and we stayed there un
til liberation, but a lot of 
things happened in that little 
village. Sometimes they wo
uld come through town, the 
Germans, and they said ammuniti
on was Œ a plane came by and dropped 
ammunition and whoever has it, they took 
the whole village, put them in the middle 
of this little park and th ey said they™re 
gonna shoot the priest if Œ they™re gonna 
shoot the priest if the amm
unition is not found. Bu t fi
nally, after I don™t know how 
many hours, they let us go. Bu t we unde
rstood everything they said, because 
Yiddish and German is very similar. And 
also, in the hotel wh
ere we lived, this 
German soldier was talking to my  mo the
r, I don™t know, in German, I guess, and he 
said, he doesn™t know what™s going to happen
 to him, he really doesn ™t want to be a

11
soldier, he might never see his kids ag
ain because you know, it™s war. And he 
always used Œ and he gave me a few candies
. So I didn™t know, we didn™t let on that 
we were Jewish or anything like that. An
d we lived in that little village and we 
really were hungry too, we didn™t have
 any food. And we ha
d a little carriage for 
my sister, and inside there was like an ope
ning wh ere she sat. So we would go into 
the fields and we would steal like potatoes 
and fruit. And my  sister would sit Œ we 
would put it in that opening 
and my  sister would sit right
 on top and th at™s how we 
would co me back to town. And I would Œ I we
nt to school there and my  brother too, 

and my little sister stay ed with
 my mother. And we had a ve
ry hard time, but all of a 
sudden they said that
 the town  will be Œ would be 
bombed. And so ev erybody went 
into the mountains and Œ everybody went 
into the mountains Œ wh at I forgot to 
mention, I™ll go back  to the mountains late
r, is that my  Œ th-the landlady, Madame 
Laville
(ph) wanted to  baptize me and my  moth
er said no. Sh Œ sh  Œ I was bor Œ my  
daughter™s born Jewish and sh
e will die Jewish; because th
ey were pretty religious 
before the war. So she didn™t do anything
. But she was always dressed in black 
because of the death of her son, and she 
had two little gi Œ dogs, one white one and 

one black one. And she was very good to 
me, and to my whole family. But when we 
went up in the mounta
ins, when they said they were
 gonna bomb the town , that was 
almo st at liberation, but we didn™t know 
it. We saw planes going by, bombs falling, 

 
Interview with Lucie Ragin

12
all kinds of things, and we stayed up th ere.
 And th en all of a 
sudden they came and 
they told us that the war is over, we can 
go back. So ev erybody was so excited, but 
they didn™t let the children go
 back because they weren™t 
sure. So they said, let the 
grown-ups, some grown-ups go back and s
ee if everything™s all right. And then I 
remember liberation, it was great. All the 
American tanks came  through town , and 
everybody was so happy, everybody was 
kissing everybody, they  were drinking. 
And one day I was playing at a fountain ri
ght there in the middle of town , and an 
American soldier, who was a Zionist, I gue ss,  he was looking for Jewish people in 

that town, if there were any Jewish people.
 So  I was playing with my  friends and he 
came over and he said, which 
one of you little girls speaks Jewish? And I said, I do. 
And he says, take me to your mother. So my
 mother lived right 
across the stre et  in 
that hotel. So he Œ he went to my mo ther, 
and my mother said she had a s-sist er in 
the 
United States
, and he says, on my furlough, 
I™m gonna try and find out where Œ 
if you Œ if she™s still alive, if she™s intere
sted and so  on. So the next time he came 
back to to wn , he brought my  Œ he heard 
from my  aunt, he brought us goodies, and 
every American Jewish soldier that came
 through town, came
 to our house and 
brought us things. And they Œ th ey didn™t
 know whether they 
were gonna make it 
because our little village was 
the beginning of liber
ation, but they still had to go on 
to 
Paris
 and 
France
 and Œ and things like that, so 
they were a little bit Œ some of

them were even crying to my mother. And 
from there we left nac Œ we left that little 
village and we went back to 
Marseilles
, because we wanted to get back to 
Belgium
 
to find out what happened to th e re
st of our family. So we went to 
Marseilles
, I 
went to school there with my brother a
nd my sister, and they still had air raids 
where you had to go into th
e shelters in the middle of 
the day. They still had all 
these things, and my father 
worked for the American ar
my , and we saved up enough 
money and then we went back to  
Antwerp
,
 Belgium
. In 19 like ™45, at the end of, 
and my Œ and we had to find
 a little apartment, it was very
 hard, you couldn™t Œ you 
couldn™t find anythi
ng. And we found a little apartm
ent and Œ and we lived there 
and ev ery time people would co me back on buse
s to the school that I went to, that™s 
wha Œ they had like a 
country yard, they would come 
back  there and they would Œ 
my mother would go to see if her sister, 
my  uncle, my  aunt, my  Œ my  cousins were 
alive, and nobody ever came back. And she 
would never walk in that street ever 
again, she would go all around.
 And we Œ I forgot to men
tion that also, when I lived 
in 
France
, I was in children™s homes, I was in Villa 
Marianne
, which is in south 
Raphael
, and I was very hungry there too, I 
used to eat the p
eels from the garbage 
when we went to the beach. I hated it. First 
of all, I wanted to be with my mother 
and father, and we wo
uld go to the beach, and I-I didn™t like it because they made 
you bathe without a bathing su it. Th
ey  kept you very badly, and the

 priest who was the one in  charge, 
he made parties, and we didn™t 
have any food, and some of the boys at ni
ght would go to  the kitchen, they made 
believe like they were sl-sleepwalking, 
and bring food for everybody. And life is 
strange, I™m Œ I™m just doing this, I™m gonna f Œ I™m just doing th is Œ I always talk 

about the Holocaust be
cause I don™t want people to 
forget. And I™m doing it for my 
parents Œ for my  parents and my
 cousins, and that™s it.  
Q: Let me change the tape. Y

Beginning Tape Two 
A: When I was in 
Tres
, I went to school. I played with the children. We st Œ we 
made little things, little clothes for the do
lls, and I always waited for Christmas 
because the children always got a lot of toys
 to play with, and Œ 
but I said I was so 
good, why didn™t I get such a big doll, or 
why didn™t I get these things. So  Œ because 
I didn™t understand, so my mother always 
used to say, oh, don™t worry. And one day 
Madame 
Laville
(ph) bought me a lot of toys, so Œ cause I waited for 
Santa Claus 
just like anybody else. And also, I loved go
ing to school, and my  mo ther sewed, so 
she sometimes would make me clothes an
d she would knit a whole night sometimes 
to make me  a pair of socks. Sh-she Œ an
d I didn™t have the things, the material 
things like other kids, but I wasn™t really 
that much aware of it,
 except when I was 
cold. And my  mo ther gave my  brother an
d me once money for milk. And we had to 
stand on line to get extra m
ilk for some reason that store was giving Œ you could 
buy mo re milk and we really n
eeded the milk for my sister 
Joujou
(ph), we called 
her 
Joujou
(ph), her name is 
Josephine
. And we were playing on line and we lost 
the money and we came home 
and we couldn™t Œ we didn™
t have the milk, and boy 
did we get it. My mo ther always screamed
, she was very  nerv ous, and my  father 
was very calm. And my sister is j u st like 
my mother, and I™m just
 like my father. I 
tried to be very calm. And I l
earned French , and I learned the 
Marseillaise
, which I

still remember til today, I don™t know
 how, because now I™m living in the 
United 
States
 a long time and I Œ sometimes I don™t 
know all the wo rds to the Œ the 
national anthem all the time, 
I™m embarrassed  to say that I forget sometimes. A nd I 
also was in 
France
 in the 
Chateau de Ma rjolet
, which they treated you pretty 
good. Bu t I was always crying, so I don™
t know. I made e v erybody cry by crying. 
And also I know a lot of kids had lice, and 
they put powder on th
eir head, or if they 
had something wrong with thei
r stomach, and I was Œ I love chocolate, I would give 
everything for chocolate Œ so, whatever they 
gave you, I took it twice, because I got 
two pieces of chocolate. But th
ey were pretty strict with 
you, and it wasn™t that bad 
at the 
Chateau de Marjolet
, but mo st kids there were orphans, and they cried a lot 
too, but I made them cry even  more, because Œ so they told
 Œ they told my mother to 
come and get me because Œ so we had to 
leave earlier than anticipated. We were 
there because after the war you couldn™t 
find an apartment, and my parents had a 
very small little room. And it was hard to ke
ep us all, we didn™t have a stove, we 
didn™t have a refrigerator and they still 
had air Œ air raids for Œ and my s Œ my 
mo ther was holding my  sister on the way to  the shelter and sh e was missed by a 
grenad e just by a step or two, so it wa
s very scary. And there was a man in our 
build ing who was deaf, and he stayed in 
his apartment all through the thing and 
nothing happened to  him, so I always used
 to say, why do I have to  go to  the

shelter? And I used to go to  the movies, 
I loved musicals. And that™s really how I 
learned how to speak English, by going to  the movies. My mo ther used to give me a 

few francs and I would go to the movies w
ith my brother or by myself. At that time 
it wasn™t like today. And we 
had Œ wh ere we went back  to 
Belgium
 we had a lo t of 
friends. Our hearts was open to  everyb
ody. When we left 
to come to the 
United 
States
, the door didn™t close all night l
ong. That™s how many people came to say 
good-bye to us, and also, afte
r the war, when we lived in 
Marseilles
, we had a 
young boy who was about
 20 years old at the time, he would come and my  mo th er 
would invite him for Passover and everythi
ng and then  I heard that he died, my  
parents were very upset, because he ate 
too much. You know, aft-after you don™t eat 
and you start eating after th
e war, you blow up and you
 Œ something happens to 
you, and I know he died and my  parent
s were very upset, because he had no 
parents, nobody and he would come to us. 
So that was bad, too. And while you™re in 
camp, you do see a lot, you see people that
 are laying, you don™t know if they™re 
alive or dead. And you see a lot of bad thin
gs. And it™s always with you, and there™s 
always articles today that will remind y
ou of it. And I™m glad they had the 
Holocaust Museum, because I 
go there sometimes. And I tr
y to go to see if I can 
find pictures that I know. An
d I find a lot of information 
and it™s really Œ I once read

that the people that died have no cemeter

was 80, and my mother lived with me til

sick, so Œ my  father had heart problems, 
Alzh eimer
, everything. And my  mo ther 
was sick too, but she knew everything til 
the last minute of her life. And you must 
always rememb er and always do things.

Belgium

France
 and I always wanted Œ I still corresponded 
with the landlady that saved my li Œ you
 know, that saved our lives, and Rabbi
 
Bloch
(ph) is the first p erson that I should th
ank, because he gave my  mo ther money 
to escape. And then Madame 
Laville
(ph) is the other one and lama Œ I don™t know 
how they did it with the

really, that all five of us surv
ived, and Œ and are here in the 
United States

mother and father were very happy here, 
they loved it. We got reunited with my

he wants to be an engineer. And my  othe
r Œ my  daughter has three boys and they™re 
still Œ they™re 16 Œ 16, 12 and seven. And I se
e them often, and that™s about it, you 
know. And I™m g Œ and I read 
things and I read that in 
Papiniau
(ph), a stat Œ a 
monument has been defaced, the 
Jewish kids that made a
nd Œ and I get very upset. 
And that™s why I think we always have to
 talk about it and there™s so many other 
problems. There™s always gonna be war. Look wh at happened in  
Darfur
, looked 
what happened all over. It™s Œ 
and look wh at™s happening in 
Iraq
 and all over. And 
Afghanistan
. And it gets me very upset. But I 
do try to  tell people that, you know, 
you have to be good to one another, that
™s the most important thing. It doesn™t 
matter what religion you are, but you ju
st have to be a good human being. 
Q: Thank you very much fo
r interviewing with us.
