actually, interviews for th
e Holocaust Museum --

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- on -- on video. 
A: Yes, I did. 
Q: So, in our interview today, we™re not go
ing to  go over as mu ch of your wartime 
experiences, as you have in 
those videos, those are -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- pretty comp lete. So -- Bu t wh at we wa
nt to do today is talk about what™s been 

happening to you since the war. 
And I™m just trying to  think of a good place to pick up. 

You™ve to ld the story of
 the day of liberation -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- and you were in Bergen-Belsen -- 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- concen tration camp . And, you know, 
one question I had, wh ich you didn™t talk 
about specifically in th
ese interviews, is the final days of the war, the co
nditions in the 
camp were just deplorab le. And you and your sister -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and two friends -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- were keeping yourselv
es alive with one potato. 
A: Yes, but we also came -- we came to Bergen-Belsen, having a li -- a portion of bread 

from Hamburg, from a -- from a so -called la
bor camp . But this labor camp was a sub-

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  4 
 
 
 
camp of Neuengamme. And it -- Neuengamme 
was an extermination camp , everybody 
knows that, but somehow we got 
transported to Bergen -B elsen, with this piece of bread 
yet. So we ate first this brea
d, and then this potato, but 
it was just impossible to -- you 
know, we were losing our strength, and could 
barely walk. So, it is 
true that we stayed 
alive with one potato, I don™t kn
ow by what miracle we did st
ay alive, but like I said, to 
the end, we couldn™t walk any more. Went in 
in the barrack to lay dow
n, and to die. This 
is when liberation came. I was really also si
ck with typhoid fever, 
but I had sort of the 
walking around typhoid fever. I wasn™t that se
vere, my sister was. 
She had to be taken 
away to a hospital, and she wa
s very, very ill. When -- When 
she got well, I could hardly 
recognize her. She look
ed worse than the pe
ople that were dead
 in the camp. But 
somehow, you see, we survived , and we didn
™t find anyone of our family. It was very 
heartbreaking, and at this point it seems poin
tless to live. There was 
nothing to go on for.  
Q: On the -- On the -- the actual day of lib
eration, as you talked
 about in your video 
interviews, you had actually, I guess, gone
 into  the barrack s, and y-you -- 
A: Gave up. 
Q: You were going to die? 
A: Yes. Yes, we did. And one of my friends, 
she -- she wanted to -- to
 just walk out, and 
sort of a last farewell look at the camp, and 
came back and to ld us that was funny th ings 
going on out there. I just said, ﬁForget it. 
You hallucinating,ﬂ you know. ﬁLet me die in 
peace.ﬂ She kept on nudging, a
nd my sister went out. I don™
t know where my sister got 
the strength to come back and grab me by my  
arm, and tell me, ﬁGet 
up, you have to see 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  5 
 
 
 
what -- what is out there.ﬂ It was unbelievabl
e. I just didn™t think I was alive. No, it was 
impossible. I thought I died. 
Q: Did you think it was some sort of dream? 
A: Yes, sort of like I was watching, you know
, this isn™t really happening to me. I don™t 
know. But it was real enough, and we we
re liberated by the English army. It was 
heartbreaking th ough, that so many people, th
ose living pe -- skeletons that couldn™t walk  
any mo re, you know, getting brea
d, and co uldn™t make use of it any mo re, because that 
too late for them. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know? 
Q: The -- The question I had about all this, be
cause you have talked 
about this in -- at 
some length in your other interviews, is if theBritish hadn™t come right then, if an allied -
- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- military force had not arri
ved somewhere in that period -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- to liberate the camp, 
do you have any notion how mu
ch longer you might have 
lived? 
A: Maybe a day or two. Because maybe I wouldn™t
 be starved to that point of dying, but I 
completely gave up, because
 I thought there was no othe
r way. There™s nothing left. 
Sooner or later, we all will be dead. This is 
the end of it. So, just 
giving up on everything.

No food, no water, nothing. 
Nowhere to turn. There -- Ther
e -- Outside the barbed wire, 
there was kohlrabi -- I probably  mentioned 
that too, the piles kohlrabi that were 
decomposed, that people there still risking thei
r lives to get one of those squash things, a 
smelly things to eat. 
Q: What are those? Kohlra
bi, what -- what is it? 
A: It™s like -- What can I say? It™s a thing th
at you used  to feed animals. And I know it 
was -- in Europe it™s called kohlrabi, I don™t k
now how to translate t h
is into English, up 
to this day, I don™t know. But that™s suppos ed to have been the people™s food. It was 

warm in April, you know. The sun was beating down  on that. The kohlrabi was 
decomposed. People were risk
ing their lives, actually, trying
 to get one, and they were 
shot. They were shot to death, almo st on th
e minute of liberation, because they were so 
desperate to get this. But I was never one of 
the brave, to go and 
risk like that. I was a 
very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my  sister was the organizer. If it 
wouldn™t be for her, maybe I wouldn™t be aliv
e, because she worked in a different place, 
where she had mo re access to food. And she al
ways used to smuggle into the camp , some 
of it for me, which was a great help. 
Q: After all that you had been  through for all those years -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and all that happened to 
you, why is it at this partic
ular time -- you say you had 
given up? 

A: Yes. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  7 
 
 
 
Q: Why do you think it was at this
 particular time that -- that 
you started to feel that way? 
A: You mean, after I was liberated? 
Q: No, just before. You sa
id you had, you know -- 
A: Because I could see that there was no he
l -- no help coming from nowhere. Nothing. 
Where do we go? Surro
unded by barbed wire and dead  
corpses. And you walked around, 
and -- and people were just dying right in 
front of you. What was waiting for us? The 
same thing, you know? So it™s just -- you might 
as well, sooner or later, because there™s 
no other way. 

Q: But you had -- didn™t you ha
ve indications that the Germans were losing the war at 
that point? 

A: Oh yes, we know that. We  know they were losing the wa
r, especially when I was in 
Hamburg, then we were still 
working there on the streets,
 you know? Th-The fliers, the 
Allied fliers, they were coming three, four, five
 times a day, and we worked there. Like it 
says in my interview, next to a radar sta
tion, we could hear that radar turning and 
beeping, and the sirens going on. They  were 
here. We could -- We could hear the bomb s 
flying, and everything. And th
e city of Hamburg was one ru
bble on top of th e other. 
That™s the way it looked. So 
we knew no -- no country  in
 condition -- in condition like 
that could win a war. It was impossible for them. But the question was, are we -- are we -

- will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this? That was the question.  
Q: Did you talk much with you
r sister or your other friends there about how the war was 
going, and -- and how long you thought it woul
d be before it ended, before it was over? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  8 
 
 
 
A: We really did not. It -- We were so absorb
ed in trying, first to 
survive from day to day. 
We did not see a tomorrow. That™s what it wa
s, just trying to surv ive every day as it 
came. 
Q: So things like what was happening in
 Hamburg with  the bomb ings, and th e -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- other things you saw, th
ey were sort of -- you would s
ee them, but it was almo st like 
that was kind of the -- the background -- 
A: Yes, it -- 

Q: -- to just staying alive. 
A: -- it wasn™t touching us, 
just this is it, you know? 
Q: Mm-hm. This may sound like a silly questi
on, but how long can four people make one 
potato last? You -- 

A: Would you -- 
Q: You talk about this one potato. 

A: Would you believe that? We 
made it last almost three or 
four days, just eating -- you 
could look through that slice wh
en we were eating. I don™t kn
ow w-what kept us going. I 
honestly don™t know. People sa
y, oh, you were destined. Go
d was watching over you, 
that you should survive and be able to tell th at 
story. I really don™t know wh at forces kept 
us alive. It™s just impossible to tell. 
Q: Before you started eating it, how 
big was the potato? Do you rememb er? 
A: Well, I would say it was 
quite a nice size, you know?  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  9 
 
 
 
Q: You™re showing about four or five inches there. 
A: I would say -- 
Q: Oh. 
A: -- something like that. 

Q: Oh, okay, so, you know -- 
A: How she found it, I don™t know. I say it was a miracle. 
Q: Right. It must have taken a lot of w
illpower not to eat more of it, at once. 
A: Yes, it did, but it seems like we were al
ways the ones that had this willpower. When 
we went to work , we got our 
portion of bread in the mo rning, some people ate it right 
away, they were so hungry. We were also th
e same way hungry, but 
my sister and I, my 
friends, we never ate the whole portion, we al
ways divided it, because I wanted to have 
the reassurance that I have so
mething to eat for later. We knew nothing else was coming. 
St -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we 
never got anything unless we worked -- one 
time -- you work ed fo r a couple weeks in a v
illage across the Elba. The village was called 
Kronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat. 
But that was also -- you had to  be lucky to  
be picked for this. You see, we were fi
ghting -- everybody was 
fighting to go to  the 
village, because the local people 
brought food for us, and there 
was more to eat, so it was 
a great big fight in the mo rning 
to get first in line, to be pi
cked for this place. We were 
always divided in different wo
rk ing groups. Most of the time,
 a majority of the time, I 
was in Hamburg, cleaning the streets.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  10 
 
 
 
Q: Before liberation, at the end, you -- you ta
lked about, in your vi
deo interview, how the 
-- there were, you know, still, of course, you 
know, German guards th
ere, but they were 
wearing surrender armb ands, and -- 
A: Tho-Those were not German guard s any mo re. 

Q: Oh.  
A: Those were -- They™re volunteer militias 
from the Ukraine, Lithuane, and Hungary, 
and they -- they had white armbands, we co
uld see that. And those people were still 
shooting at us, when  the people tried to ge
t those kohlrabi, you know? I can™t understand 
their logic, and their way of thinking.  

Q: In those final days, were there s
till any sort of selectio ns going on? 
A: No, no. 
Q: That had stopped? 
A: Chao s. It was nothing. Not where we were. 
You see, Bergen-B elsen, were like several 
camps together, divided. That mu ch I know, be
cause if -- we were with others, but not -- 
I didn™t even know that child
ren survived there, in certain  places. We di -- We didn™t 
know that, because we were not
 together with these people. 

Q: So in the end it really wa
sn™t -- the killing that was goi
ng on in the camp was not the -- 
the organized systemat
ic killing, but it -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- but things we
re still happening. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  11 
 
 
 
A: I-It -- Things were happening, and they di
dn™t have to do anythi
ng. People were just 
dying, because they didn™t feed
 -- s -- the people that were there previously, they 
probably weren™t fed for the long
est time already. So, that wa
s just like -- they were self-
destructing, they didn™
t have to do anything. 
Q: When the British came into the camp, and one
 of your friends came 
in and told you to 
take a look, and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- you started to see these scenes, and you 
weren™t sure if you were dreaming, or if it 
was real, again you™ve talked about all that 
in your video intervie
w. Do you remember 
your first contact with any 
of the -- the British soldiers? 

A: Not -- Well, we -- they ge -- 
they handed out food. This is
 all I ru -- I remember, being 
close in contact. I also  watched them later, ri
ght away film that liberation. They were 
putting it on film. And I know there is a vi
deo of it, it™s called 
liberation of Bergen-
Belsen. This is exactly what 
they  did, right away. And next
 thing I know, when we were 
sort of already settled, and they came in -- Idon™t know, they must 
have been Scotchmen, 

or whatever, they came in with their bagpipes and skirts, you kno
w. And I was sitting on 
-- on the curb, and I looked up, and that™s the fi
rst time I™ve seen a man dressed like that, 
in a skirt, and I just laughed so hard, I coul
d hardly catch my  breath, cause I didn -- never 
saw anything like it.  
Q: Do you remember what you 
and your sister said to each 
other in the first moments, 
when you realized what was going on? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  12 
 
 
 
A: We were just overw helmed, and th en my si
ster started feeling very sick, and we tried 
to get her in the hospital, but there was no 
hospitals there, there were just mak eshift 
build ings, mattresses on th e floors, and the 
people were laying ju st covered up with 
sheets. Not enough doctors, and do you know, 
the German populatio
n from around, they 
were forced to come into the 
camp and see all this. And the 
English needed  help  with th e 
sick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn
't even want to come
 in, they had to be 
brought in at gunpoint. They  didn™t want to co
me and help the sick people. It took me a 
long time to find my sister 
in those buildings. I didn™t know
 where they took her. Finally 
I found her, and there she was on the floor la
ying and holding a -- a rag with co ld water 
to her head , and she said, last night the docto r sa
id to her -- he looked at her, and he said, 
ﬁThis wo man has the crisis tonight. If she™s al
 -- If she su rvives, sh
e™ll be alive tomorrow 
morning.ﬂ She said, ﬁI didn™t sleep a whole 
night, I wanted to die with my  eyes open.ﬂ 
Here I come in the morning, and thank God sh
e was alive. Then they first started giving 
her medication. Medication was so scarce that
 they only gave it to
 people they  thought 
would su rvive. That was the case of it.  
Q: What was your sister™s name? 
A: Helen. 
Q: And is she still aliv e? 

A: Yeah, she lives in Milwau
kee. Yeah, but she does not car
e to talk a lot about it. 
There™s certain people that don™t, my  husband especially. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  13 
 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. Before we move on, maybe you 
could give us the names of your various 
family  me mb ers --  
A: My -- My -- 
Q: -- and a little -- 

A: -- immediate? 
Q: Yeah, and you know, a little 
d escription of them, and just
 what -- what you know of 
what happened to them. 
A: You mean my i -- my -- lik
e my mother and father? We
ll, my mother™s name in 
Yiddish was Matel. I don™t know 
how to translate it any other way, that™s what it was. My 
father™s name was Israel. I had two more brot
hers. One of them was called in Yiddish, 
Smaul Hirsch, and the other one,
 Yankel David. And we all came from the Lodz ghetto 
into Auschwitz, and this is what happened 
to them, they never got out of there.  
Q: Out of the ghetto itself? 

A: Pardon? 

Q: They didn™t get out of the ghetto? 

A: No, we -- we all went with the trans
port from the ghetto, togeth er we went to 
Auschwitz, but they never got out of there. 
They were -- My mother
 was with us when  
they were selecting the people, they just to
ok her right to the le
ft side. And my two 
brothers and my father, we didn™t know for su
re, but then we met a gentleman that was in 
the ghetto, a neighbor, and he was behind them in
 line, and he told us
 that they went the 
wrong way, so there was no way 
we could find an ybody any mo re.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  14 
 
 
 
Q: How about other relatives, memb ers of 
your family? Their names, and what you 
know? 
A: You mean uncl
es and aunts? 
Q: Sure, [indecipherable] 
A: My father had one, two -- he had two br
others and two sisters. I don™t know exactly 
what happened to them
, because they didn™t live in the 
same city, they 
lived in -- away 
from Lodz, in a small place calle
d Alexandroff, in Pola -- in 
-- in Polish, and my mother 
had one brother, but my  mo ther™s
 brother had about six or seven children, and from all of 
those children, two of them survived, a brothe
r and a sister. But the brother died  several 
years ago in New Jersey, he had cancer, and he 
died. His sister, I thi
nk, is still alive in 
Jerusalem. I haven™t heard from her for a lo ng time. And from my father™s sid e -- 

Q: What -- What were their names? Befo re we go on, what -- their n ames were? 
A: My cousin™s name? My cous
in™s name was Hill, and my cous -- her -- the lady™s name 
was Cela -- Celine. Those two 
survived, but there 
were more that did not survive. And 
from my father™s side, none
 of them survived, there 
was no sign of them. My 
grandparents -- My grandma -- My grandma was taken away, my  mo ther™s mo ther, huh. 

She was really an old lady. It
-It™s hard to talk about it. 
Q: Mm-hm. You said your sister doe
sn ™t like to speak of these things? 
A: Not much, no. Mm-mm. She was asked seve
ral times by th e genera
tion after in -- in 
Milwaukee that organizes the survivors to sp
eak in schools. She went a couple times, but 
she doesn ™t care to do that, no. My husband wouldn™t do th at, either.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  15 
 
 
 
Q: What about just privately, like when you 
and your sister talk, or when  you see each 
other -- 
A: Well, yes -- 
Q: -- if you talk on the 
phone, does it come u p ? 
A: -- we reminiscent -- reminiscent. I have on
e of my friends that we were together. She 
lives in New Jersey. The other one died, also 
several years of cancer. Otherwise, when I 
went -- you see, my  two daughters, I have 
two daughters, they liv
e in New York City, 
and when  we used to go and vi
sit in New York City, I used 
to get together with them, 
because it™s like family , you know, we were 
always together. One of them had died 
several years ago, she was sick. But this one is
 alive, and we are always in touch. As a 
matter of fact, we just talked on the phone about a week  ago, and we always reminiscent 

about the old times, where we we
re. They were also in the 
Lodz ghetto. From different 
places, you know, he took peop
le from all over Poland, draggi ng them into the -- certain 
ghettos from here and there, confusing us 
completely. And sh e wa
s from a little town 
somewhere, but she spent time in
 the ghetto, and from there, 
also ca me to Auschwitz, so 
we have been in the same ca
mp, afterwards. And liberated together, so we are always in 
touch. 

Q: When you talk to your sister, what type
 of things come up? What -- What type of 
things do you talk about or remember? 
A: Home. How it was before the war. About my
 father, my -- my brothers, what we all 
did. My mother, my grandmother. My grandm
other had a little grocery store. In Europe 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  16 
 
 
 
it™s entirely  different. It™s not like here, you 
know. I -- I don™t know how to describe, but 
everything was in canvas sacks,
 you know. You had a scale, 
and bags, and people came, 
and said, ﬁG ive me a half a pound.ﬂ So you to
ok -- took a bag out, and took it out of the 
sack, and weigh it, and just give it to the people.
 But they got to get on
 in age, and th -- it 
was hard for them. You d -- had no people wo
rking fo r you, if you wanted to  make a 
living, you had to do everythi
ng yourself. So they
 sold that little grocery store, and both 
came to liv e with us, grandpa and grandma. Gr
andpa died right before the war, about two 
or three years before the war, and grandma un 
-- when they came to 
live with us, she sort 
of took over the kitchen. Sh e was used to 
always being busy, and my  mo m was very 
distressed about it, because my father™s wo rksh op was sort of divided between the 

kitchen an d his work shop. So 
she used to say, ﬁMom, what are you doing? People come 
up and th ey think I made a maid out of you.ﬂ 
And she used to say, ﬁWhat am I supposed  
to do, sit down and die? Don™t 
be silly.ﬂ So my mom used to
 say, ﬁWell, why don™t you 
let at least the girls help you
 with the dishes?ﬂ She said
, ﬁOch, let them go and play. 
When they get married , they™ll 
do plenty dishes.ﬂ So that 
was, you know? And th en in 
wintry nights, we used to sit around in the ev
en ing, my  grandpa used to tell stories about 
sages, and learned man, all these cert -- also ce
rtain fables, or we used to play -- of all the 
things we used to play in wi
nter, Bingo, or cards we used 
to play, with the children, it 
was like a game. The s -- And neighbors used 
to come up, and have like a neighborhood 
klatch, you know? It was always -- our house 
was always full of comp any. People used to 
come, and even during the wa
r, when they occupied, and 
we were still in our own

apartment, my  father was for
ced to -- to work  for the Germ
ans because he was about the 
only craftsman in our little place,
 and you had to do what 
they told yo
u, you know, 
otherwise they shoot -- they co
me -- they come, my father ha
d to repair their watches. 
They  -- They brought gold pieces that they ro
bbed all these big farm -- rich farms. My 
father had to  melt them down and make bracel
ets, and rings, and whatnot, all that they 
send into  Germany. And so we had -- we had to
 work for them. A lot of them were real 
bad, but there were -- there was a single one 
among th em that would bring some bread, or 
whatever, which was very help
ful in those times. But still, the neighbors -- and there was 
a lot of people that had no fo od any mo re, an
d wh atever we had, people used  to come up, 

and we had a big bench, and a table on the side
, whatever we cooked, we always used to 
share with everybody. I-It™s not something that I™m trying to tell you because I won™t get 
a medal for it, but that™s the way it was in our 
house, we used to share everything we had.  
Q: Mm-hm. So it sounds like wh
en you talk to your sister 
about the past, mostly what 
you talk about is your fa
mily life before the war. 

A: Yes, yes, a lot of times. Well, talking ab
out the war brings a lot of bad memo ries, and 
a lot of heartache. Most of the time we try 
to avoid it, unless ther
e™s somethingspecific 
that comes up. 

Q: What might that be? What -- What -- A cert
ain anniversary, or so
mething in the news? 
A: Oh, probably . Anniversary of liberation, or
 when we go to, in sp
ring, you know, when 
they -- Yom HaShoah day comes, or whatever. 
So it™s just -- certain things come back, 
and reminisce -- then we reminisce in the -- 
those times. Remember 
when this happened, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  18 
 
 
 
and we almost dead. Like 
I got blood poisoning wo rki
ng on -- on a -- they call it 
bowshtella, we had to  dig ditches for foundati
ons for the peop -- for 
homes for the people 
that were bombed out 
in Hamburg, wh en I was working on th at place -- assigned to that 
job, and I hit a rusty nail, and I got blood 
poisoning in  my  hand, in  my  whole hand here. 
We had an infirmary, I went to this, ther
e was a Czech wo man, also prisoner. Sh e just 
digged around and digg
ed around and -- with nothing, and 
couldn™t find anything. At that 
time we had an Obersharführer who was craz
y about us being hea
lthy. He didn™t care 
about food or anything, just healthy. So  at that
 time, three of us were sick, so he took th e 
three of us, with a German SS woman, and th
ere was one of -- always picked the altesta 
from our own people, and they  took us into th
e city. Well, that camp was in Zazell, and 
they took us into the city of Hamburg. I 
-- The only thing I know, that we went into a 
prisoner of war camp. I don™t know to this day if
 it was French or Czech, or -- or Italian, 
or Czech, or whatever it was, 
I have no idea, because I c
ouldn™t recognize the language. 
And this doctor, when my -- they
 had a doctor there, also  pr
isoner. When my turn came, 
he looked  at my  finger, and he pointed, and 
then he poin ted at the plain wooden table, 

pointed that I should lay down. Stretched ou
t myself, and he poured from a bottle ether 
on my face -- just plain ether. I was choking, be
lls were ringing in  my ears, and I thought 
I was dead. This is it, I™m dying, I gave up.
 But when I woke up, I was sitting already, 
and my  finger was bandaged. And afterwards, 
they changed my  bandages in camp , then I 
could see what it looked like, my  finger was 
like separated in half. My  whole nail was 

gone, and there was a piece, they cut off th
ere a piece. B u t I healed ver -- very, very 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  19 
 
 
 
slowly. I had to go to
 work with all 
that. So, we had ups and downs in the camp , you 
know? There were some that car
ed, again, fo r food, but didn™t
 care for our welfare. These 
-- They called them the Obersharführer, 
that the camp, tha 
-- from th e SS that 
administered the camp, and we
 had a few that were real 
vicious, too. We
 had SS women 
also, and they were even
 worse than the men. 
Q: What -- If we could talk about what happen
ed after liberation. You didn™t leave, as I 
understand it, you didn™t leave 
Bergen-B elsen immediately -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- there was a period in whic
h people stayed in the camp. 
A: Well, you had to re-gain 
your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her 
brothers, they came to take her back to the 
American zone, they did talk us into going 

with them, thinking, oh maybe you still w
ill find someone, you know? We did go. Of 
course, we had no money, no we traveled how we traveled. 

Q: Let me just ask you -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Fela Warschau. This is tape number one, 
side B. -- Bergen-Belsen immediately  -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- there was a period in whic
h people stayed in the camp. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  20 
 
 
 
A: Well, you had to re-gain 
your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her 
brothers, they came to take her back to the 
American zone, they did talk us into going 
with them, thinking, oh maybe you still w
ill find someone, you know? We did go. Of 
course, we had no money, no, we traveled how we traveled. 
Q: Let me just ask you, you -- you know, in
 the camp it was you and your sister, and -- 
and you mentioned these two friends. 

A: Two friends. 

Q: Do you remember their 
names, and could you tell us
 a little bit more about -- 
A: Sure. 
Q: -- them, and where they came from, and -- 
A: Sure. The one that died is -- her name
 was Doba Finkelstein. The other one was -- 
name was Genia Stolsoft, and Genia came from
 a small place called 
Kovol, but Doba was 
a girl from Lodz, that much 
I know. She™s the one that di
ed. And it was funny with her, 
because she was looking fo r a brother, or her 
cousin, an d she found a man with the same 
last name as hers, thinking it™s a -- a relative,
 and to the end she married him, he wasn™t a 

relative. She didn™t even  have to ch ange her last name. 
Q: Hm. And how did you all team
 up, how did you and your si
ster sort of team up with 
them, and become friends? 
A: Pardon? 
Q: How did you and your sister me et th
em, and how did you all become friends? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  21 
 
 
 
A: We -- We met them while we were in Au
schwitz standing in  line, we were supposed  
to be forming lines of five, and we were so
rt of paired off with
 them, and from then on 
we kept on being together, un
til -- until we were going to th
e same camp, and by accident 
being put in the same barrack. Then we went 
to Zazell for work. So just all this -- did 
everything together, just supportin
g, looking out fo r one another. 
Q: So th en, one of them convinces you to 
go off with them. Wh
ere did you go, what 
happened next? 

A: You mean, after I went 
to ber -- to Feldifing? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yes, we did travel with them. I don™t know
 if it says there, on 
coal wagons, on freight 
trains we traveled, because we didn™t have 
any money, who get -- w
ho gets money? Just 
they gave us some clothing, and food, of co ur
se, the English. We did arrive in Feldifing, 
it was -- th e condition -- the conditions were 
mu ch better there. I can™t say anything 
against the English except that the warmth wasn™t forthcoming. They -- A little 
compassion was less a v ailable fo
r us. In the beginning they 
were shocked, you know, and 
very much overcome. But later on it seems 
like, you know -- but 
on the American zone, 
there was more the warmth of it. It was 
like -- you felt more th
at somebody cares. 
Q: How did that -- How could 
you tell that difference? What 
-- What sort of incidents 
would happen, or things did you see that
 showed the difference between the tw o? 
A: They were mo re generous if you asked forsomething, or -- you could see the way th ey  

were interested, that there was mo re co
mp assion fo rthcoming from them, where over 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  22 
 
 
 
there, it was like, very impersonal. That™s 
what it was. Th-They 
used -- the Americans 
MP™s used to come in
 into this place -- camp, because 
Feldifing had formed -- they told 
them to form their own police force, and ad
ministration, [indecipherable] infirmary, and 
all. A -- There was a vocational school there. So the MP™s used to come in with certain 
information, and they were ve
ry friendly towards everybody. It was -- It was really nice. 
Q: How long were you there? 

A: In Feldifing? We came here
 in 1951. Actually, we starte
d out in 1949, and never got -- 
first we ended up in Bremerhaven, at that time -- and by 
that time, I had a little baby. 
Q: Well let™s -- let™s sort of take this in order. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Cause again, this is stuff you haven™t -- 

A: Well, you™re asking me -- yeah -- 
Q: I will. This is material that you haven™t ta
lked about in your video 
interview. Let™s sort 
of just take it kind of chronologically. 
A: Okay , okay. 

Q: If you could tell us approximate, sort
 of were you moved,
 and -- and how many 
months you were in each place, and -- 

A: Well, I didn™t move, we -- we lived til 1949,
 in Feldifing. The re
ason we stayed there 
that long was because we didn
™t want to go to Poland, and 
we didn™t want to stay in 
Germany, and we had 
no relatives any place, so we coul
dn™t go until orga
nization started 
to sponsor survivors. 
Then we registered, okay? My sist
er came right away, and when I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  23 
 
 
 
registered, and was ready to go, okay, we a
ll ended up in Bremerhaven, but when  it was 
time to go on th e boat, my  baby got sick. So 
th ey don™t let you on 
the boat with sick 
children, and because so many people were 
-- there was a camp in Bremerhaven -- now I 
forgot already where this place was called, but
 we stayed there. I™ll h ave to remember. 
Thinking. So , anyway , so many people togethe
r, and a lot of them had babies already, 
and a lot of children were sick with all thes
e diseases th at children get. And my child 
happened to get every disease th
at were possible to be there.
 I never could go on a boat. 
Every time I had to go on a boat, she was sick
, you know? By the time I was able to, and 
then my  visa run out, my  
luck was, that up to this 
point, the visas were renewed 
automatically. When 
my turn came, they said
 they don™t do that an
y mo re, you have to go 
back to the point where we 
came from, and this is why we
 ended up again being in  
Feldifing, going back to the whol
e rigamarong again, all over. So -- 
Q: Before you did co me over here
, where did you meet your husband? 

A: In Feldifing. Because we were also just  walking around, looking for a relative, or a 

friend, and we didn™t find anyone. We didn™t
 find anyone, and he was also -- he was from 
a fami ly of six children, he was the only on
e. So ev eryone looked for -- not finding a 
relative, everybody looked for comp anionship,
 for someone to lean on. It wasn™t a 
storybook ro mances, it was people need
ing one another, that™s what it was. 
Q: What was his name , and wh ere was he from?  
A: My husband™s name is An
trul, and he comes from Lodz, 
he is originally from Lodz, 
yes.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  24 
 
 
 
Q: Do you remember in th
e camp, where you first encountered him, your first 
conversation, or -- how did you get to know each other? 
A: Well, just me eting, just saying hi, wher
e are you from? You know? And we lived in 
Feldifing, in a little ro om, it was down -- actu ally, it was called the basement. There were 
bunkbeds, and the four of us lived there. We
 were still together. So, my friend that was 
looking for Finkelstein, he used
 to come down there, and he
 used to  bring some friends 
along, and this is where we met, there we
re also, like places -- you know, the Americans 
organized dance halls, they wanted  people to 
have some fun. They  also brought movies 
into the camp , and we had traveling su rvivor™s
 orchestras giving concerts. So there was 
like getting -- public getting together, and 
where are you from, asking where are you 
from, who are you, and this is the way people met. 

Q: And how long was it before 
you and your eventual husb
and decided to get married? 
A: It wasn™t very long. Maybe several mont
hs. There were no long courtships at that 
time. 

Q: And you got married in the camp? 

A: Yes, mm-hm.  
Q: What kind of cer
emony did you have? 
A: Well, first we registered with the shtander
sump in Germany, in -- in th-this little place 
called Shtarenberg, and then we just had 
a religious ceren -- ceremony in  a Hasidic 
rabbi™s study. We couldn™t afford  anything, we
 had no money. We had witnesses, I have 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  25 
 
 
 
a ketuba, a religious one. I went according  to -- I would be accepted in Israel now, 
because I went to all these ceremonies that were asked of me. 
Q: Mm-hm. And then, did you and your husba
nd th en get your own room in the camp , or 
how did that work? 
A: Well, that didn™t wo rk th at way, because 
there wasn™t enough ro
om in the camps. It 
was like one big room, and somehow, they  gave 
us some board s, and divide it into a wall, 

and on th e other side another couple lived, and 
on this side, we lived. And this is the way 
it worked . You could hear ev
ery sneeze, and ya -- every 
word  that was going on, but 
there was no other way, until we could fi
gure out where we 
wanted to go.  
Q: Not much  of a honey
moon, I guess, huh? 
A: No. 

Q: What -- So once you were mar -- 
what year did you get married in? 
A: ™46. 

Q: What month, do you remember? 

A: May. 

Q: So May of ™46, so about 
a year after the war ended. 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: And then  once you were ma
rried, how long did it take yo
u to figure out what to do 
next? Wh at --  What discussions did you ha
ve about wh ere you might go, and wh ere you 
might pick up your life? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  26 
 
 
 
A: We didn™t, because we didn
™t, but my husband went and en
listed with this police force 
there, the displaced camp police force. AndI went and registered into the vocational 
school, and I took a course in sewing. So , for the time being, me and my  other friend, the 
one that died, we both to ok
 the course in sewing, a
nd we both took on, later on, 
alterations for other people, fo
r wh ich we got -- used to get 
fruit, or money, or whatever, 
you know, to have something.
 And my  husband, after awh
ile they used 
to get some 
German ma rks from the German govern ment
, like from the state where we were, 
Bavarian state, they used to get some Germ
an  marks, because they sort of were on a 
pilung of a police department, or whatever 
they called it, after awhile. And in the 
beginning, there was no -- 
no talk of anything, because we 
still tried to figure out where 
are we, what do we supposed to  be doing? Then
 later on, of course no one wanted to stay. 
People had relatives overseas, th
ey sent papers for them, and th is is what made us think 
what are -- what is going to be our future? Wh
at are we going to  do? We did -- We didn™t 
see any way out. Finally, this came. It was ju
st like a -- winning a 
lottery when we were 
told we could register to the united -- to go to
 the United States, or Canada, or Australia. I 
really thought that wasn™t true. I di 
-- I didn™t -- I always was the pessimist. 
Q: You don™t seem pessimistic.  
A: Ah, well. But I really was, in the beginn
ing. My sister, she was always the first one. 
That™s why, she registered firs
t, and sh e -- she just came firs
t, right away. Even if I would 
have left in 1949, she 
left before me, yeah. 
Q: Did you and your husband ev er ta
lk about possibly going to Israel? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  27 
 
 
 
A: We did in the beginning, but I don™t th
ink I would have been
 very  good material, 
because I wasn™t a stro ng person. I wanted to
 have a child, because 
everybody got killed, 
okay? So , after my  daughter was born, I was th
ree and a half months in the hospital. I 
was the one that they thought 
would never surviv e. I was deadly sick after she was born. 
And so, when I finally recovered, the doctor said to me, ﬁNo more children, cause you 
didn™t recover like other people.ﬂ I didn™t thi
nk I could s -- take the illegal journey, first it 
was Palestine, that I could take that. And now,
 finally that I got my life together, I wanted 
to live for something. And then
 I thought, let™s go first to the United States, where I can 
take a deep breath, relax, and maybe recover 
my strength. I can always go to Israel. But 
you know, once you are settled so
mewhere, and your children are here, it™s very hard to 
pick up an d go ag ain. 
Q: What year was your first child born? 
A: Pardon? 
Q: What year was 
she born, your child? 
A: My older daughter wa
s born in 1949, my  younge
r daughter in 1955.  
Q: And their names are? 
A: My older daughter™s name is Marta, 
and my  younger daughter™s name is Sally. 
Q: And you said you wanted to have 
children because so 
many people had died? 
A: Well, I still would want children, regardle
ss. I would have had mo
re, not only two, but 
I -- I even th -- with the second 
one, it was very hard here in 
the United States, and I just -
- I didn™t think I would be able to do that. So, had to settle for that.  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  28 
 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. But you did say earlier you wanted children -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- because so many people had -- 
A: That™s true, too. That is true, too. But 
under normal circumstances, I would have want 
children anyway. 
Q: Right. I understand that, I™m ju st curious
 what those thoughts were. What was your 
thinking abo -- on th at subject? 
A: Well, Jewish thinking is 
always, you have to have a 
namesake, you have to  have 
someone to remember. And children are always
 named after departed ones. So that™s -- 
My oldest daughter™s name, Marta™s actually  Ma
tel, it™s after my moth
er. And my Sally is 
after my  grandmother. 

Q:  You said that wh en you had your childre
n, especially your first one, it was very 
difficult -- 

A: Very. 

Q: -- you were very sick. I™m wondering wh
at -- I mean, it™s alwa
ys an incredibly 
emotional time when, you kn
ow, someone has a child. 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: I™m wondering if there were a whole extra 
set of emotions because this was right after 
the Holocaust.  
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
Q: So many Jews were dead. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  29 
 
 
 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And if there were a lot of extra emoti
ons, is -- can you describe what those were? 
A: They ver -- very sort of anxious emotions
, because she was also 
sickly child, because I 
was not in perfect health, and I always watc hed her and carried her to the doctor, and I 

put her -- I didn™t have a bed, she slept in he
r buggy, or whatever. 
And I sat -- half the 
nights, I used to sit by that
 buggy and watch he
r, and when she moved her fingers, or 
moved her head, I considered, oh 
what a miracle, this is mine, you know, my  own, no one 
can ever take this away from 
me. And it was -- most of the tim
e when I looked at her, I 
cried. It was a miracle to me.  
Q: Did you see having children somehow, as yo
u know, being a small part in, sort of, so 
many Jews had been taken from the earth, an
d sort of helping to bring them back? 
A: Maybe, in a way, I would say th at the Je
wish people do not disappear completely, and 
well, just for myself, I wanted, as a parent, to
 have a child. And it was, for me, to love 
and to have, and we 
always had good -- a good relations
hip with our children, and still 
do. 

Q: So, let™s go back to you were -- you were 
talking about the process of coming to the 
United States. 

A: Yes. So, we registered, and like I said, 
we were in Bremerhave
n, and we had to go 
back. We had to go ba -- go -- 
go  to  th e same co mmiss io n . We
 had to go and have chest 
x-rays, and all that stuff done again, and we 
had to travel from Feldifing into Munich, and 
a place called the Funkazerner. Now, Funkaz
er-kazerner means soldier™s place, you 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  30 
 
 
 
know, where soldiers must have
 been housed at one time or another. This is where they  
had their -- all the in -- and we had to go -- wo
uld you believe, we all 
had to go through a 
very true screening. They had to make sure 
that we were who we were, and we were in 

the concen tration camps. Somehow they couldn™
t find my  husband™s background, so he 
had to travel in Germany, to this place called
 Arelson, and bring the 
papers from there, ca 
-- so they ma -- make su
re that he is who he is. It was so
 ironical, now that I think of it, 
how many Nazis went through, that had no pr
oblems at all, and us, the surviv ors, they 
made so many problems, trying to  -- and one 
time, the second time when we went for a 
hearing before the INS, they were called, he asked me where I worked, you know? I said, 
in ha -- all the questions where I di -- wa
 -- the most work. I said, ﬁIn Hamburg.ﬂ 
ﬁWhereabouts in Hamburg?ﬂ  See? And wh en I 
told him, he says, ﬁO
h, yeah, I know the 
place, I was there.ﬂ He tried to catch me, if 
I™m saying something wrong. That really hurt. 

Q: These were American officials?  
A: Yes, yes. And my  husband was held 
back  quite a few times, because he was a 
policeman in the displaced camp, and at that
 time, the sentiment against the Communists 
were very strong, and there was organiz -- 
Jewish organization called the Bu ndt, which 
was mo re left, you know. And they had -- 
in May they  had a May day parade, and 
because he has a -- was a poli
ceman, they assumed he know
s who these people were, and 
he should  give them names of those Bundist
s. My husband said, ﬁI
 don™t know anybody.ﬂ 
He came home and told me that, after he wa
s through. I said, ﬁEven if you knew , you 
shouldn™t give them any names, because who wa nts to have a person that squeals, one on 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  31 
 
 
 
another. He didn™t know. You know, they 
had 24 hour duty. After he came home from 
duty, he slept mo st of the time, because he wa
s tired. He was not in any social integration 
there, no one was. We always tried to see wh
ere we -- what we wanted to do. So, he had 
no political interest, neither did 
I at that time. Of course, our
 symp athies were -- were 
with Israel, at that time Pale
stine, but none of us were inc lined to be Communist, or left, 
or wh atever it was. So it took several times he called them back, ma king him tell him 
who they were.  

Q: What was it like when you would -- you me
ntioned your husband ha
d to  go to another 
German town to get papers, and -- what was it 
like when you would be sort of circulating 
now in Germany? What was the -- What was th
at like? What feelings
 did you have about 
that? 

A: You mean when I go back to Germany? 
Q: No, I -- I mean at the time,
 back then, when you would -- 
A: You mean -- 
Q: -- go into German cities, or have contact with Germans? 

A: Well, we didn™t have mu ch contact with th
em, and the ones that tried to be in touch 
with us, of course, didn™t know anything ab
out it, what -- what was happening, none of 
them ever did. They were already -- 

Q: Yo-Y ou™re smiling as you say th is. 
A: -- very innocent, they were 
very  innocen t, none of th em knew anything, so -- but they  
came in to the displaced camp, the women, 
and they tried to do our laundry, because 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  32 
 
 
 
there were no facilities, just for something to 
eat, because we used to get all these CARE 
packages. The Americans were ve
ry good to us, they gave 
us many CARE  
packages, but 
then every CARE packag
e, there was so much of the sa
me thing, that they couldn™t 
possibly consume this. So we always exchan
ged it for something el
se that we needed. 
And this is what happens. So
 you had no oth -- othe
r choice but to deal with the local 
population on th at level. 
Q: And it sounds like it might have been kind of strained. 

A: It -- It -- It was, it w as, yes.  

Q: Well let™s -- let™s  pick up th is story ag
ain, where you™re -- you™re trying to get to 
United States, so you go thro ugh
 the application process --  
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- and eventually 
you do get to come. 
A: Eventually, because 
when we came again to be interv
iewed, there was this lady, the 
secretary, and sh e was marry -- married to a Polis
h guy, to a real  Po
lish guy, and I got to 
talk to her, and then I said to her, what 
was happening. And she got really upset. She 
went into  this interviewer, and said to him, 
ﬁIt™s strange that these poor people are being 
held back , and you know th ey 
have nothing, they™re poor, a
nd they™re survivors .All they 
want to do is get out of here
, and you holding them back, 
and you let go any Tom, Dick 
and Harry which is not Jewish
, you letting them go.ﬂ He sat 
there and thought about it, 
and then  my  husband came in, he did apologize
 to him, my husband told me. He said, 
ﬁI™m sorry to cause you all th
is heartache. On the next transport you bil -- you™ll be the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  33 
 
 
 
first one on the list,ﬂ and su re enough, you
 were, and this is where we went, to 
Bremerhaven. And you know what
 happened? The day we were going to go -- before the 
-- the date that we were going on the boat, 
they checked the childre
n, agenamy -- again, 
and my  daughter had a temp erature. Could you
 believe that? I sat up all night and cried, 
and gave her aspirins, and in 
th e mo rning they checked her 
again. Well, the temperature 
had gone, so they let me go on t-the boat. And 
let me tell you, all 10 days we traveled, on 
stormy seas, I thought I™d neve
r survive that. I™m never going on another boat again. And 
then the -- finally pulled in, 
and New York  harbor, it quiet down, you know? And th en 
my  husband -- of course we were not together, 
we traveled on a mil
itary boat, so the men 
were separate, and the women were separa
te, and because I had a small baby, I was 
privileged to have a cabin with another wo ma
n, separate, private. So, he came into the 
cabin, and if it wouldn™t be for him, I think 
my child would die of s-starvation, cause I 
couldn™t lift my  head from that bunk. So he ca
me in, and he said, ﬁOh, it™s so quiet now.ﬂ 
We have to come out on deck  and see what
 was going on. If you -- I went out, and it was 
the most gorgeous sight I™ve seen. It was at
 dawn, you know, it™s s
till dark outside. I 
could see the lit up harbor, and th
e first thing, bright, and wh
ite lit up, was the Statue of 
Liberty. That was so gorgeous
, I™ll never forget that.  
Q: What month and year was this? 
A: We came at the end of April, 1951. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you came 
into the harbor, and -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  34 
 
 
 
A: Of New York . And then we
 were met by representative, 
either they were UNRRA, or 
Joint, I don™t know. This is what they call 
themself for short, I can™t really tell you 
exactly how to say the whole name of them. And 
they to ok us to a hot
el, we stayed in the 
hotel for several days to rest up. Actually, th
ey wanted to send us to Trenton, New Jersey, 
but my  sister™s destination was in Sheb oygan
. S o  sh e w an t ed  v e ry  
much for us to be 
together, and asked th e local people here to in
tervene, so they would send us here. So we 
came here. So they -- in New York
 they gave us tickets and put 
us on a train, and they put 
us on a passenger -- on a coach passenger train,
 you know, with a little baby, traveling all 
overnight, sitting on a bench. She -- I didn™t know where to lay her down, she cried all 
night. And people were sitti
ng, and -- and I didn™
t know a word of English, or -- or 
whatever, and I was still very much a timidperson out of a camp, 
lo oking arou
nd, being 
afraid these people are going to scream at 
me because my  child is crying. You know, I 
was very much afraid. 
Q: As someone who originally comes from Ne
w Jersey, I™d have to say I think you™re 
better off that you went to Wisconsin, but
 -- nobody from New Jersey wants to -- 
A: I have a friend, my friend that was in
 camp with me, she lives in Englewood. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did th ey tell you why th ey wa
nted you to go to Trenton? 
A: No. There were certain cities th at took 
so many people in, and I guess they decided I 
should go to Trenton, that was it. I don™
t know, but maybe I would have had better 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  35 
 
 
 
opportunities. We didn™t have a lot of oppor
tunities here. They have a small co mmittee 
here, they welc-welcomed us, a nd because my sister was here, 
they didn™t even find us an 
apartment right away, we had to 
stay with my  sister. They gave my  husband a job, and as 
far as looking fo r a place, we had to do that
 ourselves. My husband job didn™t earn 
nothing, you know? 
Q: What was it? 
A: Just a factory job. Well, we had no educa
tion. There was no one here that said, ﬁWell, 
we™ll -- we™ll see that you get an education 
and meanwh ile see that you have something 
to live on.ﬂ Nobody did this 
here. So we had to right away
 go to work , and because his 
earnings weren™t enough, I had to go sometimes
 and help out. What could I do? There 
was nothing part time I could do in the even i
ng, just babysit or clean somebody™s house, 
that was it. But then 
my  children got bigger, and I went 
to work too, full-time, because 
they were both in school. 
So I went full-time to work. 
Q: What were your -- What was it like being ove
r here, you know, in 
a different country, 
different culture? 

A: It was very hard, because let me tell you
, in those days, people did not provide you 
with social workers to get you adjusted, in a new country. We did all the adjusting all by 
ourselves. Soon as we got a job, nobody bot
hered with  us. That was it, you got a job, 
you™re making money, you got to do it on you
r own. We had people that were very 
helpful in the places where we worked. They really -- People 
were kind, telling us how to 
do -- especially, I met very nice people that said
 to me, imi -- wa -- I couldn™t speak the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  36 
 
 
 
English, and this a big German town, let me 
tell you. It helped though, in the beginning, 
that you could speak the language, you know, and co mmunicate. But then  we 
communicated and th ey said, ﬁIf you understand 
so mething in  English, then say it. We™ll 
help you.ﬂ You know? We went fo r awhile 
to vocational school. It wasn™t a great big 
help, it wasn™t, because when
 you don™t know the lang
uage, and people start the 
grammar, and you don™t even know
 what is a vowel, or a noun, or whatever it is, what 
good is it to you? I had learned a lot fro
m watching my  neighb
or™s TV, seeing the 
motions, and the repeat -- repeated
 words, and I also 
liked to read a lot. I started reading, 
I actually didn™t know what I was reading, 
because the pronunciations here are so 

different. But slowly I got it, 
and on my  own, mo re on our ow
n, we did it. That™s true. 
But we needed a vocational sc
hool because we could not a
pply for citizenship if we 
didn™t go to vocational school, and 
learn about the government, you know? 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you and your husband feel
 like, okay, now we™re here, and we™re 
Americans, we want to be Americans? 
A: Yes, we did. We applied right away. Soon 
as we got our first papers, we did register 
right away. We came in ™51, in 1957 we were 
citizens already. This is -- We wanted to 
belong, we loved the country, it™s wonderful. W
ith all it™s faults, it™s the best place to be. 

All the freedoms a person has, no place to be found. 

Q: Do you feel like you have a sort of specia
l perspective on wh at it™s like in this country , 
given wh ere you came from, and what you lived through? 

A: You mean, what™s 
going on now, or -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  37 
 
 
 
Q: Or just in general. 
A: Well, I would say I love the freedoms, 
but sometimes the people abuse the freedoms 
too mu ch  already. They  use any excuse to 
say that you infringe on their freedom. And I 

think sometimes that people go too far in th
at respect. And another thing that nobody 
stops these people, because they 
say they™re entitled to these --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: -- ocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Fela Warschau. This is tape number two, 
side A.  
A: You mean, what™s 
going on now, or -- 

Q: Or just in general. 
A: Well, I would say I love the freedoms, 
but sometimes the people abuse the freedoms 
too mu ch  already. They  use any excuse to 
say that you infringe on their freedom. And I 
think sometimes that people go too far in th
at respect. And another thing that nobody 
stops these people, because they say they™re 
entitled to these freedoms. It™s like being 
helpless, you know? With all the freedoms, 
you™re still helpless to stop something evil 
that™s going on.  
Q: Are you thinking of specific things? 
A: All these hate groups. All these things that
 are -- insults being, or -- or going on public 
television, or on -- on the internet, online,
 and broadcasting their hate me ssages, and 
nothing can be done about it, you know? 
Poisoning young people™s -- children™s minds 
with such garbage? And 
children are vulnerable. They just don™t go and research, and try 
to find out what is the truth,
 they -- they really get ta
ken with something like that. 
Q: Does that type of thing remind you of thi
ngs that happened in  Europe befo re the war? 
Were you very conscious then of 
what was developing in Europe? 
A: Well, in Europe, most of the time the Jew s
 had no rights. I would say we were called 
citizens, but we had no right, 
we were always second class ci
tizens, as far as I reme mb er. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  39 
 
 
 
When  I was a child, you could hear em -- bei
ng said, Jew, Jew, a
ll the time, you know? 
And even  my  school, I was always good in 
languages, you know, always got the best 
grade in Polish language, so our teacher, an 
educated wo man would say to the class, 
ﬁAren™t you ashamed that this Jew has the be
st mark in Polish la
nguage?ﬂ So we were 
always aware -- always made aware of it, that 
we were Jews. Ya -- In court, you were not 
believable, because you were a Jew. If anyone
 had something agains
t you, you were lost, 
unless you could bribe the judge, or wh atever. 

Q: So you were -- It™s now, I guess, the 
50™s, you and your husb
and are both working, 
what kind of job did you get? 
A: Factory jobs. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: That™s all we could do. That
™s all we were able to do. I 
could not go work  in a office, I 
didn™t have enough understanding of the 
office work, you see? 
And you needed the 
typing, which I didn™t have. So , wh erever th
e money was coming from, this is where we 
went. I ended up wo rking in a place that 
man u factured plastic things, and we were 

inspecting all the ready products, making them 
ready for shipment. So that™s what I did 
for 29 years. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yup. 
Q: Same job? 
A: Mm-hm. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  40 
 
 
 
Q: What about your husband, di
d he stay in the same factor
y, or did he move around 
some? 
A: No, he -- he changed, because thank God, 
that first factory we b-barely -- we chased 
the rainbow all the time, very 
poor hours, very poor pay, 
but then, thank 
the lord, they 
went on strike. That was the tu
rning point. Nobody 
knew when  this was going to  end, so I 
urged him to go and look fo r a different job,
 and then  he found a
nother job, which was 
mu ch better. If he had that job in th e beginning, I could have gone to school an d learned 
something, but then , by 
that time, we had children going to
 school. So we wanted them to 
go, we did, the both of 
them went to univers
ities, we saw to that. 
Q: What was the second job th at your husband had? 

A: It was on a -- It™s f -- for them -- for a ma
nufacturing machines to pack age th ings. You 
know, like packaging toilet pa
per, or packag ing fo odstuff, and all that. They were 
manufacturing those machines, that™s what they were doing. 

Q: When -- Once you were here, and had sort of 
established your life, what sort of social 
contacts did you have? Did you get to knowmany Jewish families, 
how did that work? 
A: No, no. Most of the time we w ere just -- 
there were a couple of other surv ivors, we 
sort of circulated among ourselves, that was 
it. I was -- I would say I wasn™t even invited 
any place with the local people. I -- I don™t 
know about the others, I just know we 
weren™t. And mo st of the friends that we ma
de, we were invited, were not even Jewish. 
We had a lot of Gentile friends right away 
in the beginning, helpi
ng us a lot. And like 
when we bought this house here
, actually we hardly had any 
payment, and people helped  

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  41 
 
 
 
us paint it, and remodel, and do everything, 
without anything, and those were not Jewish 
people that helped us. 
Q: Why do you think that
 happened, was it just sort of accidental? 
A: I have no idea. I think th e people here, 
themself, weren™t that 
well off before the war. 
The war gave them oppor
tunities to better themself, and ma
ybe they were busy themself, 
trying to  get somewhere. They were just so ab
sorb ed in th eir trying to
 make it, that they 
had no time for anybody else. That
™s the only way I can figure.  
Q: Hm. I have a note here, this is from the 
museum that I -- I guess maybe you mentioned 
this in wa -- one of your other 
interviews that you had, most 
of your friends here were not 
Jewish, and it says that you said you th ink th
at™s the way it should be, and th ey  want to 
know wh at do you mean by that? 
A: That™s -- 
Q: Do you remember
 that? Saying that? 
A: That™s the way it should be? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I said that. Well, because I think we ne
ed  to communicate with people other than 
Jewish people. I had a great need to under
stand about other relig
ions, and about other 
places, because in Europe we 
were completely isolated from that. And I learned a great 
deal from my  friends, they learned a great de
al from me. And we you learn to respect one 
another, because of that, and it doesn™t matter 
what religion they are really, we are always 
good friends. We do -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  42 
 
 
 
Q: With your friends, your non-Jewish friends -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- during this period, did th
ey ask you much about wh at 
happened to you
 during the 
war, did you talk about it mu ch? 
A: Some of them did. And some of them said
, ﬁDon™t talk about it now, it hurts too much. 
Maybe later on.ﬂ And finally, I don™t know ho
w -- it started with me talking. Do you 
want me to talk about th
at? I don™t know, do you? 
Q: Sure. Sure, go ahead. 

A: Well, there was a time when they were
 speculating about Dr. Mengele, because he 
was the one in Auschwitz, doing all the experiment
s, if he was still alive, and that was in 
1985, where that was a big uproar all over the 
world, trying to  figure out wh ere he is, or 
what™s going on. And th e local paper here, want
ed to write a story tying in some one of 
the survivors with Mengele. Th
e only one that was in Auschw
itz here, was I. So someone 
directed a newspaper lady to me. She came a
nd interviewed me, and we talked. I did tell 
her that Mengele met every transport, or, at 
that time, I w ouldn™t k
now who he was. But 
I™m sure he was there. So sh
e took my life story, she wrote a big article, and she said, 
ﬁIt™ll be in the paper.ﬂ Made head lines, you know, it ma de -- the next day it made 

headlines, and I started getting phone calls 
from schools. The first school was in 
Howard™s Grove here, that asked me to come 
and speak. The teacher -- And I said to her, 
ﬁI don™t feel like comi ng. I have never spoken
 in public, and I really -- are you sure you 
want me to come?ﬂ So she said, ﬁOf course.ﬂ
 You know, my first presentation was maybe 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  43 
 
 
 
10 or 15 minutes. I was shaking in my  boo
ts. But from then on,
 apparently I did 
something right, because she keeps on asking me
 to come back every year. From then on 
I keep on going. And from then
 on, from word of mouth, other schools, and it gets to be 
more and more every year. So
, that™s the way it happens w
ith me going out and sp eaking. 
Q: How often do you do it now? 

A: Soon as school starts, I get phone calls, 
and I would say in an average, about five 
times a mo nth, for sure. Bu
t sometimes it™
s even more. 
Q: These are grammar schools, high schools?  
A: Univ ersities, high schools, grammar schools,
 junior highs, ever
ything. Also church 
groups, organizations, and civic clubs, a
ll of them. I found many of those.  
Q: Are there certain things th
at -- how do you do it? Do  you 
go in and talk of -- make 
sure to talk about certain th
ings, do you introduce yourself 
and take questions, how does -
- how do you do it?  

A: I -- I -- I -- I do my presentation, mainly th
e story of my life. I start out just with a 
little introduction, and then I ta
lk about myself, and through 
the liberation. And if it™s a 
school, then I talk to them about life here, and what they 
have here, how they should -- 
comparing my life, an d how I 
view the United States when I came here, what we have 
here, and how appreciative they
 should be, and really appreciate the life and the schools, 
and ev erything they  have. And point out all thes
e hate groups to them, try to make them 
understand that before they commit themself 
to something like that
, they should study, 
and check out the archives and 
documents, to make sure wh
at is the truth. I always 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  44 
 
 
 
emphasize all these things to th
em. So, and then there™s alwa
ys a period of questions, of 
look it up, this picture there, where all th
ese children are? You see that? That was on a 
school where about 50 of them crow
ded around, wanted  my  autograph. 
Q: You say make a p -- a presentation, wh at 
kinds of things do yo
u tell them ab out? Do 
you tell them about being in  the camp s, and wh at you saw, and -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- I™m also curious how they react. Have -- 
Have they  heard mu ch of this before, or -- 
or are they sort of in the da
rk about this to start with? 
A: Well, some of them get -- take a unit in it 
beforehand, before I come, so they will be -- 
they have some background on it. Most of 
them do. And they prep
are questions ahead of 
time, which I -- after I™m through, I do answ er 
questions for those children, and they are -
- I get tons of letters from them, and when I re
ad those, I can see that
 they paid attention, 
because they quote me 
sometimes, and telling me how appreciative they are that now that 
they listened to my story, and 
that they will never say they™re
 hungry again,
 or they will 
never say th at they™re underp
rivileged because they don™t 
have certain things, and how 
lucky they are to live in 
freedom. Thanking me for coming and telling my  story and 
calling me a hero for surviving,
 and maybe that was my  goal, that I would be able to 
come and tell people about this, so people fina
lly realize that we -- 
we should not hate 
one another. This is the mo st important thing 
I tell them, that hate is a terrible th ing. 
Q: When you talk to them ab
out what happened, 
do th ey seem very shocked? Do -- Do  
they ever have trouble believi
ng that this type of thin
g actually happens, or -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  45 
 
 
 
A: Some of them say, ﬁUntil 
you came, it was hard for me to
 believe, but you™re a living 
witness to it, so it must be true.ﬂ Because 
what reason, or what would I get out of it, 
coming here and telling a story like that? So 
they say, ﬁWe are ve
ry much convinced 
now.ﬂ Do ubters, you know? And I think wh at 
makes me feel good is
 those responses, and 
what makes me mo re feel good 
is that after walking somewher
e in the street, or walking 
into a store, when  a person comes over and says, I heard you speak five years ago in  this 
school, and she still can recogniz
e my face, and remembers what
 I said, that™s the biggest 
reward a person can get. 

Q: So do some of the students actually say to
 you, I did have doubts that the Holo caust 
happened, or -- 

A: Not very many. Very seldom
 someone will say that, yes. 
Q: How does it come up? Do th ey say that 
they looked 
into it and wondered if it 
happened, or -- I™m ju st curious where th
is sort of line of 
thought comes from. 
A: Some of them say, ﬁI have a friend that
 says that™s not true, it never happened. But 

you™re here, you told me th
at. I can see it™s true.ﬂ So. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let™s go back to sort of your -- your family history ag ain. 
A: Okay . 
Q: You™re here, your husband is
 working, you™re working. Yo
ur kids are going to school. 
A: Yes.  
Q: Eventually they went to
 college, where 
did they go? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  46 
 
 
 
A: My older daughter went to
 the University of Madison, 
and my  younger daughter went 
to Milwaukee. 
Q: And where are they today? 
A: Both  are in New York City. 

Q: What do they do? 
A: Well, I tell you, my older daughter graduate
d in social work. She did that for a couple 
of years and decided it was too heartbreaking, 
and too hard. She did not
 want that. So she 
went back , took some classes, and went in
to in surance and investment, and she™s doing 
very good. My younger dau
ghter works in a law firm. 
Q: What -- What was it like when
 they were growing up, rega
rding th e fact that you and 
your husband were Holocaust survivors? Ho
w mu ch did you talk about it with your 
children, and how did you hand
le that whole situation? 
A: Well, I did not tell them a 
lot when they were
 much younger. The only thing that I 
always instilled in them, that we are all 
people, and it doesn™t matter who we are, 
everybody is a friend, if they™re nice people. And they were like that
, they  made easy 
friends with non-Gentiles, and gen -- and -- 
and Jewish people. My
 kids had tons of 
friends coming to this place. Th
ey had a bedroom, very little 
room, because this is what 
we could afford, and the room
 was small, it -- as a matter 
of fact, it had bunk beds, 
because I couldn™t fit in two beds. But they al
ways had friends, and some of e-even slept 
over, in their place -- in that jammed place, beca
use they liked to be 
with them. So it was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  47 
 
 
 
always happy, and fu ll of kids
 around here, when
 they were growing up. I wa -- I was 
happy, too, believe me. Once they left, it
 was very traumatic
 to get adjusted. 
Q: What -- When  did you start talking to 
th em about wh at happened ? How did you and 
your husband talk ab out it, about wh
at happened to you during th e war? 
A: Well, we just tried to tell them that -- 
we had to tell them, you know, because they 
used to ask about grandparents, other relatives. 
So this is what came out. That™s what we 
had to tell them. 
Q: They would ask where their relatives 
were, or why they didn™t have them? 
A: Of course. Why do -- Why don™t they have
 a grandma? Why don™t they have a-aunt -- 
mo re aunts, just one aunt, and one uncle, wh
ere other children they  associate with have 
big families, and cousins a lot, and so you ha
ve to tell them. Not wh
en they were real 
little, they wouldn™t understand that. 
Q: Around what age did you
 start talking about? 
A: I would say by the time they were 10, or 
something like that. S
till not everything. 10 
year old child still isn™t able
 to comprehend everything. 
Q: As the years went on, and th
ey got older, did they continue
 to be curious about it, did 
they ask you to tell them? 
A: They did, but wh en I sometime s expresse
d fear, they always said, ﬁOh Mom, you™re 
living in  the United States, don™t worry about a
nything here.ﬂ They felt very secure here. 
First of all, my  older daughter, she was 
a little baby when we
 came, and my  other 
daughter was born here, so she never knew 
about, you know, be
ing -- bu -- she -- the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  48 
 
 
 
other one didn™t know either. She only said in
 the beginning, ﬁOh my God, I™m a German 
citizen, how terrible.ﬂ Because she was born there.  
Q: What about you yourself, 
when it would come up? Did 
-- Wo uld you prefer not to 
think about it, or not to be reminded of it? 
A: Well, in the beginning, none of us really
 wanted to talk a lot about it, because it 
brought a lot of heartache. It still does. It
 -- That will never go away , as long as we will 
live, never. Beca -- It™s hard to reconcile yourse
lf that the war starts
, and you™re a 13 year 
old girl, and the war ends, and you™re an adu
lt on your own, and there™s no one to turn to  
for advice, what to do, how -- 
what to do with your life, or
 how to -- to associate with 
people, or whatever. So  it™s very hard. My
 young years are gone, from childhood in to 
adulthood. It™s -- It -- It is 
-- A lot of the people can™t und
erstand that, what we missed 
out on. 
Q: Do you ever have 
dreams about the war? 
A: Oh, yes, lot of 
them. Lot of dreams. 
Q: Do you remember 
certain ones, or -- 
A: Sometimes I dream I™m there. And it™s not 
like I™m in a camp, but
 I™m trying to  hide. 
They™re coming, I™m trying to hide, and ev
ery time I™m hiding, I know th ey coming near 
to find me, and I™m running, trying to find a 
different hiding place. And I™m running that 
far, one time I was running so fast I woke up, 
my  heart was beating so fast, I could hard ly 
catch my  breath. This is what woke me up. There™s many other dreams, yeah. 
Q: Do you still have dreams today, about -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  49 
 
 
 
A: Once in awhile
, yes. Mm-hm. 
Q: Do you think that -- ob
viously, you know, in many 
ways it™s a good experience, do 
you think th at it™s been a good thing that yo
u™ve become a bit of 
a public speaker about 
the Holo caust? Has that helped you in  any way, 
sort of sort things out, or deal with it? 
A: Well, I a -- I™m very gratified that I do 
something good, I think 
I™m doing something -- 
bringing a little understanding to ch ildren, an
d some adults. And believe me, so me o -- 
some of the adults, which I™m very shocked,
 until I come, say they never heard of it. 

Would you believe that? I had 
one college girl come over and say she never heard of the 
Holocaust until I came and spoke there. This 
is gratifying, very much so, and another 
thing, I think is -- when you speak about it, 
it™s just like therapy, talking it out. At -- It 
feels like I™m talking my  heartache out, and af
ter that it makes me fe
el I™m a little more 
calm, because of that. It gives me a better f
eeling, trying to  make 
people understand what 
was it like. 

Q: Do you read much 
about the Holocaust, and 
what about films, and documentaries, and 
that sort of thing? 

A: I have tons of books on that subject, and do
cumentaries, I have several. Also, I went to 
see ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ of course, and 
there™s a lando -- on PBS, there™s a lot of 

documentaries. I try to watch,
 but sometimes I don™t any mo re, because I get very bad 
dreams, and sometimes I can™t fall asleep 
any mo re. You know, th e older you get, and 
because we are retired, our minds are more
 activated towards these happenings. And 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  50 
 
 
 
especially something like that, 
it triggers so much, that you 
can™t sleep, or wh en you fall 
asleep, there are many nightmares. 
Q: Do you -- Do you feel that what you live
d through, and what yo
u saw, had any great 
affect on how -- you know, it™s a big question,
 I guess, maybe it™s t
oo big, but how you 
see the world, or -- or how you see other human
 beings, or just humanity in general. Do 
you think th at you saw things one way befo
re the war, and it was drastically different 
afterward, or what -- what™s that been like for you? 
A: Well, as a Jewish person, before the war, 
I knew -- like I said, I knew I wasn™t equal to 
the others, because I wasn™t treated that way, but
 I always felt I was, in myself. It wa -- It 
was instilled into me by my pa
rents, that we are good people,
 and we did not do anything 
wrong, it™s just too bad that other people can™t recognize that. But wh en I came here, I 

rejoiced in all this freedom, I also look very  cautiously  
on everything, because of the 
things that I went through. I™m always 
a little skeptical, and a
fraid. I™m still afraid, 
because of what™s happening w
ith -- with this mushrooming gr
oups of hate, what is going 
to happen ? And if they wouldn™t someday pr
evail. This is what
 bothers me a lot. 
Q: I imagine you™ve 
returned to Europe. 
A: I was, mm-hm. 

Q: How often have you gone? Ha
ve you gone to Germany? 
A: I -- We went -- The first time I went back 
to Po land in 1978, and my  hometown, there 
was one Jew there, of all the people. And th ere was no cemetery any mo re, just all the 
stones, just -- they were made on a sidewa
lk, you know? And after awhile, they were 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  51 
 
 
 
taken out. This Jew asked the 
Polish government after the wa
r, so he went, and they just 
laid there, pilots of rubble, you don™t kn
ow where they  belong. 
I wanted to go there 
because my grandpa was the onl
y one that died natural deat
h, and I wanted to see his 
grave, but I couldn™t see anything. And I di
d travel to Poland, I -- I went back to 
Auschwitz, I went back there. 
Q: This was in 1978? 
A: Eight. It was -- It w as very hard to do th
at, but that™s -- that™s 
fro m -- where I lef -- lost 
my  whole family. I wanted to go and say a pr
ayer for them, I wanted  to do that. Yes, 
that™s what I did. 
Q: What must have -- What was it like 
to walk into that camp again?  
A: Very bad, thinking that I™m
 back in it, you know? The firs
t thought was, is it really -- 
am I really walking here
 as a free person? It was a eerie feeling, yes. 
Q: Was your husband with you? 
A: No, not the first time, he
 didn™t want to go, mm- mm. 
Q: When  you went to your hometown  in 
Poland, did you see a
ny of the houses, or 
buildings you remember, pl
aces where your family -- 
A: Oh, sure.  

Q: -- used to live, th
at were still there? 
A: Oh, sure. The marketplace there, the house where -- the place where we lived is there. 
I couldn™t get in, because the people that 
lived there were workin
g, it was locked, you 
know. And later on, or even if they were, 
they were afraid to open the doors. They 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  52 
 
 
 
thought maybe I came for someth
ing. But it™s there, the build
ing is there, I saw it. I 
walked around the streets, I 
walked around where my school
 was, in the neig hborhood, 
all -- all of it, everything™s there, just like I le
ft it. I alw ays say, the little town of Ozercuv 
without the Jews, is just like 
a piece in the Twilight zone, fo
r -- it™s teeming with life, you 
walk out a minute on th e street, and co me back, 
a-and it™s dead, nobody is there. And th is 
is the way it™s -- did stri
ke me, at that time.  
Q: So it actually had not changed mu ch -- 
A: No -- 

Q: Since the war, or it has? 
A: I would say they improved a little bit, th
e -- the roads, the s 
-- the buildings, they 
renovated some of that. But otherwise, it™s -- 
Q: That™s -- That™s fine. The cat is inves
tigating. Bu t you™re saying otherwise it™s what? 
A: Otherwise it™s the same, it™s ex actly th
e same. Life goes on without the Jews, you 
know? It was teeming with Jewish people be
fore the war. There was a lot of industry. 
The biggest factory of textile
s was owned by a Jewish man,
 and several -- quite a few 
hundred people, Gentiles, all 
of them were working there 
and making a living of that. 
Now the factory belongs to the gover
nment. It™s still there, so -- 
Q: How do you feel about 
Po land and Germany, and Po
les and Jews in general? 

A: Well, I feel like that th
ey say they suffered, it™s true. Polish people were also 
exterminated, but they 
were not exterminated, some of 
them, for the same reason, not 
because they wanted to exte
rminate a race. They did it be
cause they were afraid of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  53 
 
 
 
uprisings. Th-They did it to po
litical people, and whatever they -- like I always hear 
homosexuals, or whoever went, th ey™re going ag
ainst them. That™s wh
y they did it to the 
Polish people, the intelligentsia
, that they shouldn™t be sort
 of wising up the lo c -- the 
population to revolts. Those they
 exterminated. But especially 
for the reason, just to wipe 
out a race, they didn™t do this
 to the Polish people like they 
did to the Jewish people. So, 
what I would have to say, that
 -- in the respect, they didn™t
 lose what we lost. They still 
have a country, wh ere we got to  be 
people without homes, no place to go. 
Q: What about Germany? Other people I™v
e in terviewed, who went through th e 
Holocaust, either avoid it all together, or if th
ey are there, they -- th
ey get out as quickly  
as they can. They  
don™t -- you know -- 
A: I wasn™t in Germany last time when I was th
ere. I felt that I didn™t want to go and see 
the country, because I always fe
lt bitter about this big martial 
plan, where I said, we sat in 
the displaced camps, with nowhere to go, an d here all these millio ns are being poured 

back in the perpetrato
r of all these atrocities, making 
them prosperous, where they sat 
home, in their own homes. They lost people
 in the war, they lost homes, of course. 

People got killed in the bombings, but they di
d it to themself, they 
have no one else to 
blame for it. Still they had a coun
try, they had homes, they ha
d mothers, they had fathers. 
And here we were helping them back, to ge
t back to wealth, and here, we that lost 
everything. And they shed our
 blood. We are sitting in Ge
rmany, in displaced camps, 
with nowhere to go. I felt ve
ry, very bitter about that.  

Q: When  -- You mentioned that your husband
 did go with you to  Europe later on? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  54 
 
 
 
A: He -- Yes, he did, later on, he -- we went
 three years ago, we went. And then  that time 
I did go into Germany, because I wanted to see the displaced camp wh
ere we lived for so 
many years, after the war. That™s the only reas
on I went in there. Ot
herwise, I had no -- I 
have no business in Germany. 
Q: So you and your husb
and went to the camp  together -- went back? 
A: We went back to the camp together, yes,
 mm-hm. And we traveled
. We did go back to 
Poland again. He wanted to 
go back to Lodz, where he liv ed. There was a little street, a 
little side street, in that big 
city, the whole street was demo
lished, there was nothing there 
but the empty lot. He was just so
 traumatized when he saw that.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Fela Warschau. This is tape num
ber two, side B. -- later on? 
A: Yes, he did, later on, we -- we went thre
e years ago, we went. And th en, that time, I 
did go into Germany, because I wanted to s
ee the displaced camp where we lived for so 
many years, after the war. That™s the only reas
on I went in there. Ot
herwise, I had no -- I 
have no business in Germany. 

Q: So you and your husb
and went to the camp  together -- went back? 
A: We went back to the camp together, yes,
 mm-hm. And we traveled
. We did go back to 
Poland again. He wanted to 
go back to Lodz, where he liv ed. There was a little street, a 
little side street, in that big 
city, the whole street was demo
lished, there was nothing there 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  55 
 
 
 
but the empty lot. He was just so traumatiz
ed when  he saw that. And of course, we 
traveled -- since we were there, we went to
 law -- to Warsaw, we looked at the Warsaw 
ghetto buildings, and all 
the historical places. 
Q: Sounds like it was a very emotional trip for both of you. 
A: It was. I don™t intend to go back th ere again. I don™t think I could take that. 
Q: Yeah. I™m curious what your reaction is. Yo
u know, we™re doing th
is interview, right 
now there is a supposed peace plan  in Ko
sovo, but for the last, you know, few months 
especially -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: The Albanians were driven out of Koso vo -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- and there have been a lot of references
 back to what happen
ed in World War Two, 
by commentators, and politicians, or whatever. 
And when things like 
this happen in the 
world, or especially a story 
like that, in -- in -- 
in Europe, I™m curious
 how you™ve been 
feeling while this has b
een in th e news, and what your reaction has been. 

A: Come on, anyone that compares this to
 a Holo caust doesn ™t think straight, because 
Koso vo, those two factions, are people that ha
ve their land, and each  one is fighting for 

possession and power. They  figh
ting each other, right, and it™
s -- they™re shedding blood, 
which is unnecessary. Things 
could have been resolved p
eacefully, but people are too 
hateful, okay. I am very upset about childre
n and people being k
illed, but don™t ever 
compare this to the Holocaust. The Jews had 
no co untry, we did not start a war with -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  56 
 
 
 
start a war with Hitler. We were citizens of each
 country that we lived 
in, and this is -- we 
tried to live peacefully, we had 
nothing against anyone. We we
re simply killed, and tried 
to be exterminated, because we were Je
ws, simply. The goal -- 
Hitler™s goal was to 
exterminate the Jewish race. We were not fi
ghting for property, or for a country . We did 
not have a country. Ko sovo, and 
the Serbs, they have
 countries, right? Th
ey lived side by 
side each other, and each one wanted to dominate
, and this is what started it. They fought 
one another, okay? And they -- Wh atever happ
ened there, it™s thei
r own fault. They 
brought it upon themself, I feel sorry for all 
the people, for the -- lik
e I said, for the little 
children -- innocent children -- in
nocent people being killed. 
When I see that, I g et very 
upset, because it does remind me
 of World War Two, and of
 the killings, but you can 
never compare it to the Holocaust, never. 
Q: What about the argument that some people ha
ve made that of course this isn™t like the 
Holocaust, but if countries had acted when 
whole populations were being persecuted in 
the past, then a lot could have be-b een avoi
ded. And this whole 
notion that now, you 
know, something sh ould be done, and it shoul
dn™t be permitted, do you -- what about that 
argument? 
A: I think that -- I-I™m all for helping, I™m
 all for helping, because I remember h o w 
helpless we were. We looked towards England,
 and towards the United States, thinking 
any minute that they will come
 in, and it will be done swiftly
, and that we would not have 
to suffer all this. But you see, the problem 
was that Hitler was bluffing, and the world 
was afraid, and they  let them get away with
 everything. And he 
got so big and strong 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  57 
 
 
 
because -- and it was all the other countries™ 
fault that they let them get that far. 
Everybody stood by and let them just do it. No
body interfered. This is what I™m trying to 
say. If they would interfere right away, so
 much bloodshed would not have happened . 
That™s wh at I™m trying -- we have to see, we
 have to interfere. Of course, I don™t go mu ch 
for Americans being killed over there. It™s a bi
g tragedy. But I think 
we have created the 
United Nations, all the countries together, shou
ld see to it that ther
e should not be any 
wars, and any bloodshed. 
They should interfere. 
Q: Mm-hm. Does -- Were you very  -- Before 
the war, were you and your family very 
religious? 
A: Yes, we were. Very Orthodox. 
Q: Mm-hm. And, are you still, or -- 

A: I™m not, I™m more Conservati
ve now, because there is no 
other way, especially here. 
Well, I mean, I keep kosher in
 the house. When  we go out, there is no kosher restaurants 
here. So we just try to eat whatever possible we
 can. But as far as that, I try to observe the 
Sabbath. We go to Temp le, we 
belong to the Temple
. I also have been a member of the 
Sisterhood of the Hadassah. I have been -- I have
 been the past five years the president of 
the Hadassah, also. And I have be
en involved in my 
children™s -- I used 
to be a 4H leader 
once, for my younger daughter. In -- And a
ll the other things. The Girl Scouts, and 
everything, whatever possibly I could. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  58 
 
 
 
Q: One thing I wonder about it, you know, gi
ven what you went thro
ugh during the war, 
what you saw happen, what you 
experienced first-hand, did that
 -- how did that affect, or 
did it affect your notion of God? 
A: Well, after I was liberated, didn™t affect 
me anything. I just didn™
t believe in anything. 
I couldn™t figure out a merciful God lo oking do
wn  could let all of this happens. And if He 
has a hand in all this, He™s the ruler, and ma
ke things happen, why 
did He let all this 
happen? I couldn™t cons -- justify that, and 
I couldn™t understand. And I -- My doubts 

were, is there a God? If He was there, why di
d He let that happen? Very mu ch, I was very 
angry at God, let me tell you.  
Q: And then, what™s happened since then
? Do you still feel the same way?  
A: You sort of -- You have to have somethi
ng to believe in, otherwise there™s -- there™s 
nothing to live for. I -- I think you have to. 
And it™s not that I justify what happened, but 
then you start thinking, and you think there ha
ve to be some powers above, that are still 
ruling this world, and why this
 happened, I will never know. 
So there -- ther
e™s so much 
my stery in this world, and a pers
on has to believe in something. 
Q: So, do you feel like you st
opped being an gry at God? 
A: Slowly. 
Q: But there™s no great answer. I mean, I 
guess what I™m wondering, do you think, in 
what happened, was there some m
eaning in this, or it was just this incredible outburst of 
evil, and it doesn ™t me an anything, or -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  59 
 
 
 
A: I -- I still can™t figure out why it happened. 
The rabbi™s explanation is that God created 
us with two wills, one good, and one bad, an
d it™s up to you which way we go, okay? So, 
but why did the bad got the upper 
hand, I can™t figure that out.  
Q: Just to go back  during, you know, all 
the years you -- you liv
ed here, and you™re 
raising a family, -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- and you know, solid citizen
 of Sh eboygan, Wisconsin, and all that, any other -- any 
stories that you want to tell, 
or any incidents, or things y
ou remember, or -- or stuff you 
felt at the time that so mehow 
hasn™t come up in our conversation, that you think is wo rth 
mentioning? 

A: Incidents about what? 

Q: Anything.  
A: I -- I think most of the time, I encounter
ed  good people, and thro ugh my  traveling, I 
met a lot of people that stick to me, and are 
friends. We™re in touch, they co me and visit 
me, they invite me to their homes. And I™m 
very happy about that
, most of them are 
schoolteachers, and all these other people 
that -- and when I say -- sometimes make 
comment that I™m amazed, you know, educated pe
ople like that, they really want to be 
my friends, and they answer me, in a ways, you 
are more educated than
 we are. So, I feel 
very humble, you know, that -- when they  te
ll me that. And I -- The only regret may be 

living in a small town. Right no
w, I don™t, because we retir
ed, but when I was younger, I 
figured, if we would have been in a larg
er city, maybe we would have had a better 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  60 
 
 
 
opportunity to better ourselves financially, be
cause in bigger cities, there were larger 
committees, and there were othe
r ways the newcomers were 
treated. So, I don™t know, 
maybe we would have been 
better off. But then, you don™
t know the language, and you 
don™t -- you don™t have money 
to move around, you just st
ay where you are. And once 
you™re settled, it™s hard to move. 
Q: Mm-hm. I think in one of 
your video in terviews, you me
ntioned that before you came 
here -- they have a little quote here, that you 
said that you had heard wonderful things 
about the United States. 
A: Oh, yes. 
Q: And we™d  like to know, wh at had you heard? 
A: My mo th er used to tell about inventions, pe
ople discovered this, or that, or made some  
gadgets,  you know how they wo
rk . And my  father was always
 busy wo rking, because in 
Poland we had to wo rk many 
hours to make a living, you 
know? So he had no time to 
read the paper, and my  mo m used to sit next 
to him while he was wo
rking, and read the 
paper to him loud. And then wh en she read 
about something like that
, she should -- used 
to shake her head, and said, 
ﬁOnly in the Un ited States, things like that could happen. 
This mu st be some wonderful place.ﬂ You kn
ow? And lada -- some  of the people that 
immigrated  before the war had relatives sendi
ng back letters, and tell
ing him all about the 
buildings here, and all the things, what wa
s happening. So she always thought it was a 
wonderful place to be, and I was very much im
pressed by it, and that was always in my 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  61 
 
 
 
mind, wh at she said. When  we had a choice 
of going places, I always wanted  to come 
here.  
Q: So, partly because of what she had -- 
A: What my mother used to 
read, and there were all these 
positive things about what she 
had said.  
Q: Mm-hm. And then, when -- in
 the first few  years you were
 here, do you th ink that the 
United States lived up to th
e advance billing, or not? 
A: Oh, I would say very much so, because 
you know, we lived on a little place, where 
everything was primitive. There wasn™t runnin
g water, there were no flush toilets, there 

was nothing. And I came here, and saw all th
at you could have, you know, refrigerators, 
you know, and gas stoves. Ther
e was never anything like that when I was a little girl. 
Running water in the house, a -- a -- a bathr
oom, and bathtub in  the house, where we had 
a big tub, you know, all the time. So, I th
ought it was wonderful,
 oh. And even now, 
when I sit in my dreams, such
 foolish things, I try to imag
ine I™m talking to my mother, 
that she™s sitting next to me, and I™m saying 
to her, ﬁLook Mo m, how wo nderful. All you 
have to do is press a button, and your 
clothes gets washed. 
Can you see all these 
wonderful things that are her
e?ﬂ It™s just my mind always th
inks back, and I™m trying to 
carry on a conversation w
ith her, in my mind.  

Q: What™s the cat™s name? 
A: Sasha.

Q: She had something -- She -- 
She -- She wants to add so mething to the conversation, I 
think. 
A: No, he -- he wants to go in ther
e, I think my husband™s in there. 
Q: Oh, okay. Well, I think we™ll be 
done in  a -- in a minute or tw o. 
A: Pardon? 

Q: I think we™ll be done in a minute or two. 
A: That™s fine, no problem. He™s v ery no
sy, he likes to investigate things. See? 
Q: Yeah. Now, he™s checking 
out my tape recorder. So, y
ou say you have dreams where 
you™re actually -- you™re show
ing things to your mother? 
A: I™m carrying on a conversa tion with my mother, or ev
en with my father, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. So , wh en you came here, you loved 
it, there were all these amazing sort of 
material things. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: But was there -- was there anything you missed,
 is there stuff that-- or some aspect of 
life that -- that you had in Europe, that you 
feel is -- doesn™t exist so much here, or 
anything like that? 
A: Well, I would say, in the 
beginning maybe not, 
because the closeness with the families 
was always there, even in -- and the other peop
le™s lives here. People were much closer in 
families than they are now.
 Children and parents were together, things were done 
together, and I was always invited to people™s
 homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that. 
Everybody sat down at the table, the children we
re there, our children were there. And s -

- s -- conversing afterwards. So it was like ri
 -- somehow, the fami ly that we didn™t have, 
it was compensating very much
. The only hard time was when
 it came to our holid ays. 
So, it was very hard to  take, because you sa
t at the table, and you thought of the 
wonderful times you had at home, surrounded by
 everybody, and by all the trad ition. And 
all of a sudden, all of this is gone, and 
that™s what it is, hard facts of life. 
Q: Mm-hm. Is there an ything else that we ha ven™t talked about, th
at you™d like to talk 
about? 

A: You know, off-hand, I can™t 
think of it, but probably by 
the time you™re gone, I would 
say I should have said this, or I should have
 said that, and th at™s what probab ly will 
happen. I just -- I don™t know. I know one th
ing, when  we get old, we survivors who 
think time is running too fast for us, we try to 
do so much mo re, to be
 -- that it should be 
left behind. You -- You know, my  two daug
hters never got married, I don™t have any 
grandchildren, it™s hard to take this. They ju
st elected to be career women. Yeah, I would 
like to have some grandchildren, somebody 
left to remember ev
erything, but then  I 
compensate myself at the mind 
that all of this is recorded
, and some people will know 
about it anyway. So 
this -- I think this is a very good 
th ing that is happening to me. And 
many schools also tape me, and th
ey have that on their files. And I go, fo r the fourth  time, 

I went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University
. And th ey always tape it, they considered 
this a lecture. And every year, 
when I come, they make a tape 
of whatever I say, and they  
file in their files there, 
so that -- that™s something 
that I think is very good.

Q: You know, it -- it has been 
so many years, and the people
 who did the live through it, 
who are still alive, obviously are 
not going to be 
around forever. 
A: Of course. 
Q: You mentioned earlier when we were talk
ing, that you™ve al
ways still -- an d your 
children used to try to reassu
re you about it, been a little apprehen sive about what could 
happen, what -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- you know, somehow something similar 
happening -- happening in the future. I™m 
wondering if -- what your feelings are also 
about once all the people who actually lived 
through this -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- are gone, and whether the memory w
ill persist, or will it be forgotten? 
A: I think maybe for awhile it 
will persist, but I™m afraid with time, it might just be 
something in  the archives that now and then
, someone will look it up 
for some reference. 
This is the way it probably will be, sadly. I sa
y that very sadly. In the beginning, maybe, 
the first sev eral years after we are gone, it 
will be still carried on, 
but later on, I don™t 
know. That™s what I 
think will happen.  
Q: Is that something y
ou worry about, or -- 
A: Yes, I think it™s very important it should 
be reme mb ered, and I do wo rry about that, 
but I -- it™s beyond me, you know? Once we g
one, we gone, there™s 
nothing we can do 
about it.

Q: Mm-hm. You know, it see -- ju st seems that
 in my own lifetime, that -- you know, I 
was born in the early 50™s. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And it seems to me that it™s 
really been in the last, say 20
 years or so, there has been 
much more talk, much more sort of public stuff, more movies.  
A: That™s true. 
Q: Things like the Holocaust Museum be
ing established, and all that it -- 

A: Right, yeah. 

Q: -- that actually -- you know, as a kid,
 I learned about it in history class. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And actually, you know, I was raised Catho
lic, but we discussed it in religion class. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: But other than that, you know, 
just in the general culture -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: I would say until ab -- you know, roughly
 about 20 years ago, there wasn™t a 
tremendous amount about it, and th en -- 
A: That™s true. That it very true. I-I tell 
you why, because the initiative has no -- had not 
been taken by Jewish leaders here. We, the su
rvivors alone tried to organize these things. 
You see, the survivors themself, o rganize the 
Yom HaShoah day. It wasn™t national like it 
was now, but I remember from early days on, 
we used to go to Milwaukee, and all -- all 
of us survivors get together somewhere, 
and observe Yom HaShoah day, but later on, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044  66 
 
 
 
when it got to be more popula
r, then local officials joined
, and it got to be on -- on a 
wider scale, and this is the way it happened. 
But we, the survivors, 
started that ourselves. 
Of course, we didn™t have all this power to
 get it on such a large 
scale. The Holocaust 
Museum did a lot to -- too, you 
know, to make this happened. 
Q: Mm-hm. So really, it was 
the survivors here that -- 
A: Yes, mm-hm. Locally here, we hardly di
d anything, if we the few surviv ors didn™t 
take the initiative to do something, but now
, for two years, they are having like ca -- 
sending out letters to the schools here, 
and they should write a theme on why the 
Holocaust should be
 remembered, and they 
reward them with prizes, and a get together, 
and a little ceremony. But this is only the seco
nd year th at they™v e been doing it here 
locally. Otherwise it ne
ver had been  done.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: My husband and I always 
used to go to
 Milwaukee. 
Q: Well, that™s about it for my  questions. Again, before -- 
A: That™s fine. 

Q: -- we go, anything else you wa
nt to bring up or mention? 
A: I -- I™m a blank right now. 

Q: Well, I -- I will just say again for the re
cord, that you did two long interviews, video 
interviews -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- with the museum, those 
are in the record there --

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- about -- you know, in 
-- in -- in great detail -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- your -- your experiences actually du
ring the war. We™ve ta
lked about mostly 
different things here today. 
A: Right. 
Q: But anyone who™s curious ab
out any of that, the tapes are on file, and they  can go back  
and listen, it™s -- 

A: Right. 
Q: -- some amazing, fascinating things on it.  
A: Were you -- Are you satisfied
 with what I have to say? 

Q: Oh su re, of course.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Well, let me just -- let me ju
st end our tape. So anyway, if -- 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- if there™s nothing more to 
add, then I™ll just thank you fo
r taking the time to talk to 
us. 

A: Oh, you™re welcome. It™s very nice of yo
u to come and take your time, and I™m glad 
you came, and we had this nice talk. 
Q: Well, I always knew  there would be 
some reason I would go to Sh eboygan, 
Wisconsin. You turn ed out to be it, so --

A: Oh, thank you. 
Q: Okay. Well, we™ll turn off 
the machinery, we™ll let you ac
tually open up your door, 
and put on the air conditione
r, and do all that stuff that makes noise, and -- 
A: That™s fine, no problem. 

Q: So thanks again for taking the time. 
A: Oh, you™re welcome, very welcome. 
Q: All right. This concludes the United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview
