w with Walter Meyer, conducted by Ginger

th

interview to a United States Holocaust Memo
rial Museum videotape interview conducted 
with Walter Meyer, in 1996. Th

mo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this

side one. 
Answer: All right. My name is Walter Meyer, M-e-y-e-r. 
Q: Okay. And I -- We™re going to start with th
e post-war, or really, I know the story, a 
very touching story about the 
Red Cross taking you home, and 
I wanted to ask -- my first 
question is, when  do you id entif
y the end of the war, or libera
tion period, as some call it? 
A: Well, when the Americans occ
upied the city of Düsseldorf -- 
Q: I should ask, where were you? 

A: I was in the basement of my house, because  the city -- the Amer
ic ans were across the 
Rhine, not only was the city bom
barded by the air, but also by
 artillery, so we were in the 
basement of the apartmentbuilding in which we lived. 

Q: When  you say we? 
A: That is my  parents and I, plus the other tenants.

Q: Your mo ther had gotten tenants for -- in the same house, or -- 
A: Well, it was an apartment house of six apartments. 
Q: Okay. And going back just 
a little bit, when the Red Cro
ss took you to 
your mother -- 
to your home, is that right? Do you remember
 any particular impact that the Red Cross 
had on your rescue? A lot of people have me
mo ries about the Red Cross and th eir work . 
A: Well, it was not actually the Red Cross. The 
Red Cross wanted to take me to a hospital 
and I insisted, I said, ﬁNo, I am dying, I wa
nt to go home.ﬂ So I -- An old taxi cab, 
converted into somewhat of an
 ambulance took me home and I told the driver, ﬁGo and 
ask for my father. Don™t shock my mother, 
because I haven™t seen  her for some time.ﬂ 

And -- So, later on, I heard he went up, asked fo
r my father, wasn™t ther
e, then he told my 
mo ther that he had something for her, and my  
mother thought that it 
was a suit case that 
my  father had sent from France. And he had 
finally said, ﬁLook, why don™t you go with  
me?ﬂ So I -- my mother walk
ed down. It was snowing, a
nd sh e looked into the car and 
she was a little confused becau
se she didn™t recognize me
. And so then I told her, 
ﬁMother,ﬂ and finally, after she looked three tim
es, says, ﬁWalter?ﬂ And that is when she 
called a neighbor to have to ca
rry me in, and I remember th
e neighbor touched my  legs 
and they were inflamed and extremely pain
ful. So, eventually, they got me in and 
someone in the train had given me
 an apple, that caused me 
to have a little diarrhea, so I 
asked them to take me to 
the bathroom. And shortly th er
eafter, the bell rang, it was my 
father and my mother yelled, ﬁPaul, Walter is 
here.ﬂ So he came and he saw me and then  
he just couldn™t control himself and cr
ied for a long time. Then  they sh --

Q: Why do you thi
nk he was crying? 
A: Because of my condition. 
Q: He also did not expect to see you? 
A: No. Maybe three days later, two policemen
 came looking fo r me, and my  father said, 
ﬁYes, he is here.ﬂ And he brought them in 
and he uncovered me, said, ﬁDo you want to 

take him like that?ﬂ And I think I weighed 
about 78 pounds. And one of them knew me 
because I was a star sw immer, 
and they told my father, ﬁN
evermind, we™re going to say 
that -- that he was not here
.ﬂ So they left and then 
we accommodate -- accomm odate 
ourself in the basement. Maybe a day, maybe 
two, maybe three days later, my father, 
upon my mother™s suggestion, 
tried to find a doctor who a
ssured my parents that there 
was no hope. So a priest was called, who 
gave me the last sacramen ts, and -- but 
obviously I didn™t die. And then  wh en the 
Americans marched in, I think it was April the 
12
th
, my  father went to see the commanding o
fficer, told him about me and they came 
with the military ambulance, and took me to
 a German hospital which was occupied by 
an American medica -- medical comp any, an d 
I was with them, ooh, 
for quite some time. 
Q: How far from Düsseldorf, from your parents, were you? 
A: Oh, th ree blocks. 
Q: Oh, that™s wonderful. 

A: Yeah, the hospital was kind of -- 

Q: So the hospital was take
n over then, by Americans? 
A: Yes.

Q: And did you say that there was 
a Jewish man in charge, a docto r? 
A: Yes, Major Hermann. 
Q: And one of the questions that I wanted
 to  ask you is -- is a long time sort of 
prospective from the post-war to the presen
t time is, fro m here, from this doctor, have 
you experienced prejudice because you are a Ge
rman in certain circumstances, and if so, 
where? 

A: Oh well, once with  Major Hermann. We didn
™t -- It didn™t mean enough to him that I 
had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a 
Nazi. I was a German and that was enough for 
him, he being Jewish. After that -- No, I th
ink -- Well, of course, when I traveled in 
France, at that time it was near impossible 
to tell somebody, I am
 German, they would 
have liquidated you. So  I traveled through Fran
ce as a Frenchman. I have participated in 
conversations like, these Goddam
n Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on 
and so forth. So, except -- un
til when I came to South Amer
ica, w h ich is about as pro-
German as you can get, in a
ny part of South Am
erica, and quite anti-Semitic. So as a 
German, no, except for the -- th
e -- the time immediately  after 
the war in other European 
countries, where I didn™t dare say that I wa
s German, other than that no, I had -- there 
were no repercussions becau
se of my heritage, no. 
Q: I want to go back to your being in the 
hospital and three blocks away and how lo ng 
you were in the hospital and 
did you see your parents? 
A: Yeah, my parents came from 
time to time and I remember 
that I gained, oh sometimes 
as much as a pound and a half
 a day. And one day the American doctor told me that my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 6
 
 
 
 
heart would not support so mu ch gain of weight
 and that I had to get up and I thought that 
was a bad joke. Bu t I rememb er h-he telling 
me that I h ad to ju
mp  on one leg 13 times 
and then on the other one, 
where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a 
wheelchair and I would do sketches of the 
GIs. And th en, maybe it was two or three 
months later, I walked with this cane and I wa
s released and I was then with my parents. 
And Americans, shortly thereafte
r, were replaced by the British. 
Q: In the hospital? 
A: No, not in the hosp
ital, as occupation troop. The -- The -- si -- T h e American military 
zone -- part of the American military z
one became British. They
 -- They re-divided 
geographic areas, where the Amer
icans stayed in Frankfurt, He
idelberg and so on and the 
British used another part of
 Germany and of course th
e Russians took all of East 
Germany. 

Q: You had quite a -- a rich life since, which is
 why I wanted to start here, and I also had 
a question, although I unde
rstand that you were a pers
on who loved adventure, I 
wondered how long you
 stayed at home, and why did you go? 
A: Situation in Germany wa
s rather unbearable, Black 
Market, one German would 
denounce another German for being a memb er of 
the Nazi party, for having done this or 
that. The en tire country was destroyed, Dü ssel
dorf 75 percent. There didn™t seem to be a 
future. Money did not exist, 
it was bartering. Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main 
items for bartering. My parents had lost my
 brother, who had fallen to his death in the 
Alps. My mother continuously 
cried. So it was a period of depression and even though at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 7
 
 
 
 
that time it was an impossib
ility to leave, you couldn™t le
ave -- you couldn™t go in the 
street after 10 o™clock. But somehow I flirte
d with the idea of going to America. And 
anybody with whom I would have shared the id
ea would have declared
 me insane. I went 
to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who 
-- I understand th at he had an estate, or his 
family had an estate in  Amer
ica. And I didn™t know th at 
much about the difference of 
South America and North 
America, to me America was Amer
ica. I went to see him, and I 
reme mb er he asked me, ﬁWhe
re do you want to go, ev
entually?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ I said, 
ﬁAmerica.ﬂ ﬁWhat part of America?ﬂ And I sa
id North America ju st
 to give him an 
answer. He said, ﬁWell, I™m very
 sorry, but my family
 has an estate in 
-- close to Buenos 
Aires, in Argentina.ﬂ Then I we
nt to see my father, and I to
ld him that -- that I was going 
to try to leave. Said, ﬁYou 
know that™s impossible.ﬂ Well, I 
said, ﬁI™m going to try.ﬂ And 
he said that, ﬁIf I didn™t know you, I woul
d say you are crazy, but -- but there™s no need 
for me to say anything. All I say that whatever
 person you meet, just expect them to be no 
good and if they are good, you™re going to  ha
ve a very pleasant surprise.ﬂ That was his 
advice. I had previously tried -- well, let me
 explain that many Germans in large cities, 
knowing that the cities were to be or were 
being bombed, took certa
in items of value and 
shipped them to relativ es in rural areas, 
which happened  to be the Russian zone. My 
parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends
. And going to the Russian zone was quite 
an adventure and I went to the Russian zone se
veral times. And that itself is quite a story. 
Q: Was this the Russian zone in Germany? 
A: Russian zone in Germany. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 8
 
 
 
 
Q: And that meant that the Russians were in
 charge of everything [indecipherable] 
A: They were the occupying force, and they
 were terrible. So, we™re -- going to the 
Russian zone was in itself so
me thing like going to  a foreign country. I had gone there 
twice, so I figured that somehow I sh -- I s
hould be able to go. I had an address of a 
relative of a friend in Belgium. 

Q: What was your mo tive for going? 
A: Oh, I was sick and tired of Germany, of 
the situation in Germany, thought there must 
be better places in the world th
en, than corruption, Black Ma rket, degeneration, etcetera, 
etcetera, etcetera. 

Q: So you said goodbye to your parents? 
A: Well, I didn™t say, excuse me, I didn™t sa
y goodbye, I told my 
mo ther that I was going 
to a water polo championship, and she said, ﬁT
here™s nothing like that.ﬂ ﬁYeah,ﬂ I said, 
ﬁyeah, yeah, yeah. I™ll be back 
next week.ﬂ I came to see he
r again seven years later. So 
she didn™t know that I was gone. She thought
 I was going to be away for a few days.  
Q: Did you tell that to her to pr
otect her, if anyone asked, or -- 
A: Oh, yeah, I -- I -- n o , I told
 that to her because she would not have allowed me to 
leave, and I didn™t want her to cry. So I stow
 aw ay to Achen, which 
is right on the border, 
and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me
 that I gave to a railroad employee, and I 
asked him -- I spoke to him with a French ac
cent and I told him that I had been  in 
Germany as a French prisoner of war and th at 
I™d fallen in love with a German girl and 
I™d come to see her and I need
ed  to go back . And I wo ndered wh ether he could help me,

whether there was a train going across. He told
 me about a cargo train and well, I hid in 
that cargo train and went to Belgium. I went to
 see an old farmer. Ma
tter of fact, I visited 
the farmer™s son last year. And he told me, 
ﬁDon™t come up, they ™re looking for Germans 
all over the place, so -- 

Q: How did he know you? 

A: He didn™t know me. I told him who I was.
 He was the cousin or nephew of a lady in 
our neighborhood. You 
have to underst -- 
Q: Oh, sorry. 

A: -- You have to understand the situation.
 The border towns in Germany and Belgium, 
they were German during the Kaiser. After 
the Kaiser, they -- th
ey  b ecame Bel g iu m. 
Hitler took it back, and after Hitle
r lost, they returned to  Be
lgium. So those areas, like 
Alsace-Lorraine, they all speak German and they™re probably more Ge
rman than Belgian, 
or Germ -- [indecipherable] so 
anyway , he gave me some sandwich, an apple, and told 
me that I should wait for the milk truck. It to
ok me to Liège. Well, at -- at noon time, I 
was in -- in Brussels and I st
ayed a few days in Brussels, 
visiting with a friend of my  
father. Then I went to Fr
ance and eventually I became 
a sailor. That went on until 
December of ™48, when I stow awayed on a 
-- on a Dutch freighter
 and went to South 
America. 

Q: Before we get to South Am
erica, I -- I was interested  that you learned English from 

American GIs. Could you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 10
 
 
 
 
A: Well, I didn™t learn from them, let™s say th
at I progressed, cause 
I had had English in  
school, and I was -- I™d  always been a linguist,
 so languages are not of any difficu lty to 
me, and so, with the GIs, I had a very good
 opportunity to practice and to learn more 
vocabulary and maybe become a little more A m
ericanized in -- in 
my speech pattern. 
Q: And this is while you were in the hospital? 

A: True, true. 
Q: So, how did you get to South America now? 
A: Well, I stow awayed on a Dutch 
freighter and went first to Brazil. 
Q: How -- Do you remember th e 
name of the freighter, or -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Par-Parkhaven. Pay -- P-a-r-k
-h-a-v-e-n. One of the oldest
 ships on the ocean at the 
time, was still a coal ship, an
d then a -- there weren™t too 
many coal ships around any 
more. 

Q: Coal, c-o-a-l? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And from what port did you -- 
A: From An twerp. 

Q: How do you stow away? 

A: Well, at the time, in  different ports of 
Europe, I went aboard ships, and -- well, the 
first time I went on a ship wa
s I worked in a nightclub in 
Bo rdeaux drawing portraits and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 11
 
 
 
 
a captain walked in and he was -- he was 
quite drunk already, but I did his picture 
anyway and he paid me and he drank mo re, a
nd ev entu ally he was un
able to -- to walk, 
and I felt sorry. And in port cities, there™s al
ways danger of being attacked. So, I took him 
under my  arm and took him to his ship, whic
h was the Silver Ocean, a Swedish ship, and 
oh, it mu st have been th ree in the mo rning,  and when I woke up, we were on the ocean. 
He looked  at me and said, ﬁWho are you?ﬂ And 
I told him, he said, ﬁWell, if you help ed 
me to come aboard th
e ship, I ought to help you.ﬂ An
d he gave me a seaman™s book, 
which is kind of an ID card fo
r sailors, and with a seaman™s 
book, you can actually work  
on almo st any sh ip that needs help, but I 
lost the seaman™s bo
ok eventually. Anyway, 
with him I went to Casablanca. I went back  
to continental Europe and I was trying to 
stow away on an  Argentine ship, but
 the captain kind of smelled -- 
Q: What part of eur -- you mean
 you went directly back on th at
 same ship to return to -- 
A: No, I went -- went back on another ship 
and went to Toulouse. From Toulouse I think 
he went to La Rochelle. La Rochelle to 
Lavre, and I went eventu ally -- went to 
Rotterdam, Amsterdam and eventu
ally I came back to Anverb 
and I received at the post 
office, letter from my father, 
who said that, ﬁDear Walter, th
ere -- you will not be able to 
leave Europe for America. Your mo ther ha
s baked special cookies for Ch ristmas and I 

ask you to come home and be with us for Ch
ristmas.ﬂ And I wrote back, ﬁIf I don™t get a 

ship until next week, I™ll be home.ﬂ And that
™s what I would have
 done, but on December 
the 16
th
, I was on th e Parkhaven and stow awayed
 on the Parkhaven. I had someone wh o 
helped me. The way it goes wh en you stow aw
ay from a European  port, you try to stay 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 12
 
 
 
 
hidden for at least two days, until you™re fa
r away from the British Isle, because if not, 
speed boats will pick you up and bring yo
u back. Captains hate stowaways aboard. 
Q: Could I ask you, before we 
get too far on this ship, did your father know that you were 
leaving, whereas your mo
ther did not? He knew where to  write you. 
A: Yes. Oh, by that time -- by that time, of c
ourse after one week, I didn™t return and I 
sent letters home, s-so oh yes, my mother 
knew I was gone. She still hoped that I would 
be back so on. And so, on th is ship, I think 
the second day, the chief steward came and 
discovered me. The beds generally have curtai
ns so the light doesn™t bother you so mu ch 
and he drew  the curtains and 
he saw me there. And th ey convinced him not to report me 
to the captain. By they
, I mean the few guys who knew ab
out me. And so he said, ﬁWell, 
can™t leave him here, you have to  find another hi
ding place.ﬂ So they  put me to the mo st 
horrible place of all places, and that is where 
the propeller of the ship is. Well there is a -- 
there™s a small ladder going down  
if you have to repair the propeller, and there™s some 
old, big ropes lying there. And I was there, 
well, I guess a day and a night. And boy, you 
could  always feel the water comes almost to
 your feet and th en goes back down  and it™s 
solid black. I mean, a -- a -- a dun
geon is nothing in comp arison. 
Q: Did you have food? 
A: Yeah, they -- they -- they 
dropped some food down, or they
 let it down with a rope, so 
I ate a little bit. Well, anyway, 
after that time never passed, th
ey finally got me out and -- 
and then  took me to the captain and th e capta
in, remember asked me about my nationality 
and I told him I was French. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 13
 
 
 
 
Q: You had no passport or
 anything like that? 
A: No, I have no passport and -- and he -- oh, 
I told him that I was -- spoke Dutch and he 
asked me to pronounce Slavaninga, which is
 a city in Holland and no French man can 
pronounce Slavaninga, it™s just 
impossible. So  I says Slavan
inga, he says, ﬁYou™re not 
French.ﬂ And so  I told him that actually 
I was from Alsace-Lorra
ine and I also spoke 
German, and he kind of accep
ted that and he told me wh
at to do and I became a coal 
trimmer. A coal trimmer is one that shovels coal
 and sh oves it to the firemen, who in  turn 
put the coal into the fire. 
So I worked together with 
a -- with a black guy from Cura
ao, 
his name was Lovey. And I had a shift from four
 to eight in the morning and four to eight 
in the evening. I began to do drawings, co
pies of photographs and I became rather 
popular on the ship and the captain called me  one
 day and told me that we were going to 
first go to Vitória in Brazil and that he asked 
me to be quiet, that he would not turn me 
over to the authorities. I had to
ld him that I had an uncle 
in Utawai who was waiting for 
me, and that came because I had met some guys
 on an Argentine ship . One of them had 
told me that his family lived
 in Montev ideo , that I was welcome. Then he gave me an 
address in Montevideo . The other one gave me
 an address in Buenos Aires where I could 

stay. So anyway, I told the cap
tain that I had an uncle in 
-- in Montevideo and he said, 
ﬁI™ll bri -- take you Montev ideo , so just don™
t move in Brazil and let the immigration and 
the police come aboard and I™ll take care of 
you.ﬂ And so Lovey, my  comp anion, asked 

me, ﬁWhat did he want?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ 
I say, ﬁhe told me that he 
wouldn™t turn me over to the 
authorities.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou can™t trust the ca
ptain, there™s no way 
he will protect you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 14
 
 
 
 
He™s going to turn you 
over to the authorities and you™ll be
 shipped back.ﬂ Well, I didn™t 
want to take a chance, so we 
came to Victoria -- Vitória -- 
Q: In what country? 
A: Brazil. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And, see, the foreign sh ip never comes in
to the port, it™s always
 a pilot that guides it 
in. So the pilot came, I said, 
ﬁThis is it.ﬂ So I jumped and swam ashore. But a police boat 
picked me up. They  took me police station -- 
I was not allowed to swim there and then 
they didn™t ca -- quite know wh
at to do with me. 
An interpreter came, and he happened to  
speak English so-so and German quite well. 
I think his grandfather was German. And I 
convinced him not to tu rn me over 
to the immigration offices in Rio. 
Q: This is the end of side one. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: -- interview with Walter Meyer, tape one, side B. 

A: So I convinced this Germ
an speaking interpreter to le
t me go and I stow awayed on 
the same -- same ship, for 
the second time. The captain was extremely furious wh en he 
saw me. He -- He -- I -- He could hardly 
believe that I had not trusted him and I 
convinced him that there was too 
much at risk, that I didn™t 
want to go back and well, he 
finally understood an d said, ﬁWell, I promise 
you I™d take you to Uruguay,ﬂ and so he 
did. And I went to see the family of the man wh
o told me that I could stay with his family 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 15
 
 
 
 
and I was told very clearly th
at there was no way for me to stay there, that the man was 
on th  -- on th e sea, that he would not be back
 for another month and that I should go to 
Argentina, would be easier than Uruguay. So  I 
went back to the captain, I told him that I 
talked to my  uncle, who had moved to Bu enos 
Aires, an d, ﬁPlease Captain, take me there 
with you.ﬂ And he said, ﬁNo, police in Arge
ntina is little -- too bad, I don™t want any 
problem. But if you stay here, sooner or late
r we™ll come back to Uruguay and we™ll take 
you back with us then.ﬂ ﬁWe
ll, thank you very mu ch.ﬂ I th
ink he gave me 10 Uruguayan 
pesos at the time and told me that 
I would always be welcome. Then -- 
Q: Welcome on his ship? 
A: On his ship. 
Q: So he liked your wo rk
 and your -- personally? 
A: Oh yeah, he li -- he liked me well. Three o™
clock in the morning, I went to visit the -- 
you have tw o branch es on a ship
, the -- the officers and the e
ngineers. The engineers, the 
chief engineer, first engineer, second enginee
r, depending upon the si
ze of the ship, they 
have a third and the assistant engineer, that™s
 one who went to school and is doing his 
internship. Well, that wa
s Chris. Told Chris, ﬁI have to
 go with you.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI™m 
going to lose my license, I can™t help
 you.ﬂ Well I said, ﬁNobody will know.ﬂ 
Q: What license? 

A: His license as an engineer. So, at three 
o™clock in the mo rning I came aboard. People 
were asleep. I left a little -- I had a little suitcas
e, small, little suitcase with clothes that I 
left with him, and I had nothing on but sh
orts and he took me under the -- under the

fireplaces. There are all kinds of pipes. He 
took me underneath th
ere and he said, ﬁBe 
quiet here, nobody will find you.ﬂ Well, I was 
there until the next day, and I heard by the 
noise, the -- the ship was moving. It was going
 across the river Plate to Buenos Aires, 
which is eight hours -- 12 hour
s, something like that. And th e size of my  room was about 
like being in a coffin. What I di
dn™t know is that the crew, th
e firemen, knowing th at they 
would be in Buenos Ai
res for about a week, 
and they didn™t need 
any power, because the 
pilot would pull them in
, they began to clean the fireplace
, and all the warm ash es fell on 
me. A-And I was beginning to  realize that I wa
s losing my  conscience and I just couldn™t 
stay, so I crawled through th
e door and I came out. And I ha
d a big layer on -- of ash on 
me. They told me later that 
they thought I was a black guy.
 They  rinsed me with the 
water hose and then they recognized me. 
ﬁWhat are you doing here?ﬂ Well -- And th ey 
called the chief engineer, the cap
tain was asleep and the chief 
engineer said, ﬁI™ll have to 
tell the captain. I™m very sorry
, I can™t assume this kind of
 liability and you will be 
handed over to 
the authorities.ﬂ 
Q: Authorities where? 
A: In Bu enos Aires. So, I decided to go fo r a swim again, and I swam about -- oh 
probably about four or five
 miles to the port of Buenos Aires, until I heard some 
policeman screaming. I assume th ey said yo
u -- you™re not allowed to swim here and I 
said, well, don™t wo rry. I got out and jump
ed on a No rwegian ship
. I remember they 
asked me, ﬁWhere you coming from?ﬂ And I 
pointed way, way out there, ﬁI came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 17
 
 
 
 
swimming from that ship,ﬂ and they kind of ce
lebrated me like a h ero and gave me some 
special soap, I was oily, and -- 
Q: What language did you communicate in? 
A: English. 

Q: English. 

A: And I was a little scared b
ecause they had told me there 
was sharks, and so -- and the 
River Plate is filthy because all the ships throw 
all the debris in the water, so when I was 
swimming, I hit a piece of a board , of wood
, or something like that, and I was always 
scared it was a big fish. Anyway, I waited for my  ship to come and af
ter the authority had 
come aboard , everything was cleared. Then , I 
went to visit, and the captain saw me and 
said, ﬁHow in the wo rld did you get here?ﬂ And I laughed and I said, ﬁSwimmi ng.ﬂ So  

then he said, ﬁLet me tell you again, any time 
you want to come with us, you™ll always be 
welcome.ﬂ 
Q: What did he admire about you? 
A: Well, that I had done the impossible, sw
am from his ship. I mean, it was an unusual 
thing to do. So then I went to
 see -- I went with Chris and I had th e other address of this 
Argentine officer, Asketta was his last name , 
that I could stay with his grandmother. So  
we found the address, which 
wasn™t too far away from the 
port, but I was told no way I 
could stay there. And Chris had to go back
 to the ship, and it wa
s January, it was the 24
th
 
of January , 1949. 
Q: And Chris is? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 18
 
 
 
 
A: Chris is the assistant engineer. And I ended 
up close to Plusa Italia, a big, big square 
with a large, large park. And that™s -- that 
became my  house for a couple of weeks. So I 
became a homeless an d I rememb er oh, the f
ourth day, I saw these horse carriages 
driving around the square very slowly and 
I was curious. You al
ways find somebody who 
speaks either German or French or English 
or whatever, and I learned something rather 

interesting. They were walk
ing around -- slowly around the square, because those were 
driving hor-horses -- horse carriages. Anyway, 
there was a -- th-the famous circuit -- the 

racing circuit of Bu enos Aires was close by 
and I heard the noise 
in the morning where 
the race cars came. There were gar -- guys putti
ng these big blocks in the curv e -- straw 
blocks. And some guys were building little kios
ks where they sold s
odas and so on. And I 
made friends with one and he
lped him, so I had free sodas and maybe a sandwich. And I 
took some of the blocks and 
built myself a little house, to have some protection. It was 
hot, and summer in Buenos Aires is very hu
mid, very unpleasant. Well that™s -- And I 
stopped people on the street a
nd asked them if they had maybe a pesos to spare, that I 
wanted to eat something.  

Q: What I™m wondering is, were there a lo
t of people after the war, who were just 
traveling around, like you, lost? Or -- 
What were you seeking? Did you know? 
A: Maybe there is something innate in me an
d that is seeking adventure. But -- Th -- Y -- 
I owe you an answer to your question, a
nd that is, traveling was extremely difficult 
because, well, as a German of course, Ge
rmany did not exist,
 hence there was no 
passports.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 19
 
 
 
 
Q: W-W-Why did it not exist? 
A: Well, because is was occupied by -- by diffe
rent -- as a country it didn™t exist, it did 
not have a government. The British were ther
e, th-th-th -- so there was a military 
government, but there was no pa
ssport of any sort, so you couldn™t go an ywhere, it was 

totally out of the question. And others, of 
course, other -- other Europeans, well, why 
would they travel? This was not the time, lik
e today that the Dutch go as tourists to 
Tunisia and so on. 

Q: I was more referring to a lot of Jewish 
people who were in Displaced Persons camp s 
and families who were se
parated and -- did you ru
n into any of these? 
A: Well, that was -- th at was immediatel
y after the war, you had refugee camps. In 
Germany there was one cl -- and I know qui
te a few Jewish fellows in -- close to 

Frankfurt in a refugee camp. Most of them 
were, I think, Polish Jews. And they were 
trying to be -- they were displaced, so were
 -- they were -- they were trying to be 
organized and sent back, but ther
e was no traveling per se, no, no. 
Q: So you didn™t find a lot of co
mrades, friends to travel with? 
A: No. 
Q: You were very solitary. 
A: Oh, very much so, y
eah, yeah, very much so. 
Q: So, where are we now? 

A: Well, we are in Buenos Aires, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 20
 
 
 
 
Q: You said that South America was very fri
endly to  German. Could you all of a sudden 
start speaking German, and -- 
A: Yeah, I was not -- As a matter of fact, 
I would find eventu ally, people who would say 
things like, ﬁYou know Walter, the only mistak
e that Hitler made, he didn™t kill all of 
them.ﬂ That™s what you would hear. 
Q: In  South America? 
A: In South America. 
Q: Why do you think South Amer
ica felt that way about Jews 
and why do you th ink that 
they were so friendly to Germans? 
A: Because the Germans, first of all, there 
are large German coloni
es in South America, 
in Argentina, in Chile and 
Peru. Chile, mostly. And the 
Germans are very desirable 
immigrants. They™re not trashy.
 They become teach
ers, they beco me professionals. They  
integrate, marry natives, contrary to the Br
itish. So they™re very much desired and in 
demand and some of them become outstandi
ng citizens, some of them enter politics, 
some of them become statesme
n. So, as a whole, German 
immigration, ev en in Texas 
here, I mean, people go out of their way to sa
y, ﬁOh, my  grand-grandfather was German.ﬂ 
It doesn™t make a damn bit of difference to 
me, but they show you 
that -- they will not go 
out of their way to say that 
their great-grandfather was Polish, but if he was German, they 
will let you know. And of course, there™s 
many, many German town
s here, Brownsville, 
Fredericksburg, Neid erveld, all kinds of Germ
an festivities and so 
on. So, anyway, going 
back to South America,
 then products made 
in Germany meant quality.

 21
 
 
 
 
Q: Did you meet any Nazis? 
A: No, th e only one that I didn™t meet, but I 
-- that I saw once, somebody took me to have 
a beer at a place where German
s would go. There was Genera
l Galland, the very famous 
young German Air Force gene
ral who had shot down, I do
n™t know, 200 British planes, 
or something like that.  

Q: It™s G - a -- ? 
A: G-a-l-l-a-n-d. And he ha
d been  imported by th e Argentine government to wo rk as a -- 
I assume as a consultant or something like 
that, in the Argentine Air Force. I saw him 
kind of from far away. But no, I had neve
r -- I had never -- no, I™d never met any 
[indecipherable] 
Q: Because many were in hiding 
there in South America when -- 
A: Yes, I understand that, but no, I never me
t anybody and later on I heard that some had 
been in Argentina an
d they were down in the Patego
nia, and -- but no, I never met 
anybody. 

Q: Okay .  

A: Okay . So  we are in Buenos Aires now an d I stop people on the street, asking them to 
help me with a pesos or two. And, then I go
 to restaurants and draw sketches and I meet 
one who helps me get a job in a -- in a place 
that makes posters for the subway, so I do a 
little painting there and they say, ﬁWell, we
 can™t employ you for 
too long, because you 
don™t have documents.ﬂ And one day I -- a fri
end of mine said, ﬁWhy don™t you drive out 
to Martinez, which is a suburb where the film
 studios are and they  always need  temporary 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 22
 
 
 
 
work ers. Maybe you get a job 
there.ﬂ And I went there, a
nd without going into too many 
details, I met an American movie star by the 
name of John Carroll, who is long dead. He 
had co me down to do a picture with Ad ele Ma
rra and with -- with the Argentine actor 
who became famous later. I used to room with  him and that was Fernando Lamas. And so 

John Carroll somehow 
liked me, and I went from living 
one day under a tree and the 
other day on an old mattress, I went to one of
 the most beautiful estates in Buenos Aires, 
which he had leased, and became his assist
ant. Went to Buenos Aires to exchange 
money, helped to organize a 
party. I did wh atever. Of course, that lasted only wh ile he 
was there, and then  he said, ﬁI want you to  
come to America, to 
be with me.ﬂ And he 
took me to the German -- to  the American consulate. And I rememb er I was a little 

surprised that the consulate™s  name was 
Gerra, which was a very -- which is a very 
Spanish name. And I was told, ﬁWell, you™re 
German, and that means we have to put you 
on the waiting list and the way it stands right now, it™ll take about six years.ﬂ And -- 
Q: They knew you 
were German then? 
A: Yeah. At that time, I didn™t have to hide
 any more. Let™s see. Oh, maybe my next job 
was singing in a -- in a nightclub. 

Q: So you ju st gave 
up your opportunity? 
A: Well, John went back to th
e States, and I had made some connections. Another thing, 
John went to this nightclub with  me once,  called Zanzib ar and th ey  had a couple of 
German waiters, and they were rather nice, I 
went to visit. And one day, there wasn™t 
much traffic, and I took th
e microphone and sang a little, ﬁNight and Day.ﬂ They said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 23
 
 
 
 
ﬁWhy don™t you sing? We need somebody.ﬂ So
 I made a little money and I think I knew 
three songs and sailors would co me in, ask, 
ﬁWhy don™t you sing this, why don™t you sing 
this?ﬂ All I knew was three songs and I was al
ways happy wh en th e hour was over. So 
that™s how I started. O n e day I met -- a custom
er came and I did a sketch of him, and he 
said, ﬁDo you like the countr
y?ﬂ ﬁY eah.ﬂ ﬁWell, why don™t you come up  north, to 
Salta?ﬂ Well, that™s like coming from New York to Texas, something like that. So I took 
the train, went there and went to Salta, north
ern Argentina, close to the Bo livian border. 
Worked for him and eventu
ally I came to have a small to bacco plantation. 
Q: Your own? 

A: My own. 
Q: How did you afford it? 

A: Well, h -- I worked for him. People take a lo
ng siesta and I said well, if I w o rk a little 
for him during siesta time and I have a little 
time in the evening and 
work for myself, and 
he had about 20 acres, or maybe 30 acres. Said
, ﬁCould I have that land for me, to plant 
some tobacco for myself?ﬂ And he
 said yes. So, I slept maybe six hours, I felt th at was 
enough then. But that -- I had -- I was going to
 be somewhat of a millionaire that year, 
because the tobacco
 was beautiful and Per
on had decreed that noth
ing any more
 could be 
imported, ev-everyth ing had to be made in Argentina. So -- 

Q: Peron being the president? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 24
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. So, no more tobacco from outside, so
 the national product went up in price and 
I was going to make a hell of a lot of money, 
but the day of harvest, the locusts came and 
destroyed everything. 
Q: How long had you been in South America by now? 

A: Oh, a year and a half, something like that
. And -- So th en, other people asked me to 

run their farms for them. I had made many frie
nds. But eventually I le
ft Salta, I went to 
Chile and work ed as athletic director for a -- a copper mine. 

Q: That™s quite a switch isn™
t it? Tobacco farmer to -- 
A: That™s quite a switch, yup. 
I wo rked  in Chookiecarnata in north ern Ch ile and I went to 
Bolivia and I don™t know how much -- how ma
ny details you want, but I did many, many 
things over a relatively short period of time. 

Q: What made you move again? 

A: Something didn™t wo rk right, or somebo
dy told me about a golden  opportunity to 
drive cattle from Bolivia to Brazil,
 three months on horseback. 
Q: I would like to sort of ke
ep bringing us back wh en -- k
nowing, in your travels, your 
experience during the Holocaust, were these 
thought running through
 your head, of being 
in prison, or of what might be -- happened 
to  your parents now, or do you reme mb er 
thinking about the past? 

A: Well, you think of the past, except when  
-- when what happens to
 you is so rich in 
adventure, then you don™t ha
ve mu ch of an op
portunity. The past 
always comes back 
when you™re a little depressed, 
or when you have a lot of 
time. New things happen, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 25
 
 
 
 
meet a new woman, you meet new friends, yo
u -- things are going okay, you have a -- 
you™re going to a party, you have a ball, or
 you™re in danger. The go
od thing is that the 
Holo caust taught me to be able
 to be long times without fo
od. I™m a very tough man. So, 
I always laugh, here in  America, people 
-- people always starve. I am starved, I am 
starved, when they haven™t eaten for three hou
rs, and they can™t live any longer without a 
Coke. You know, I go -- I drove yesterday no
n-stop 12 hours, doesn™t bother me. And I 
don™t stop to drink. No, I have a little bottle 
of water next to me. So -- So you -- you do 
think of the -- of the miserable parts in 
life when you™re depressed, when  you™re 
miserable, then you think of 
mo re miserable things and ev entually you feel sorry for 
yourselves. But if things go well, or new adve
ntures happen, then  y
ou don™t think of that. 
Q: So, how much longer were 
you in South America before 
you first went to the United 
States? 
A: First time I came to the United States on my
 way to Europe. I obtained a tourist visa. 
Q: From? 

A: In Peru, to visit the 
United States as a visitor. 
Q: And you had been in  S
outh America for how long? 
A: Well, from ™49 to ™54, and -- which br
ings upon another -- another series of 
adventures. I came to -- to Miami -- 

Q: Tell me what -- what it looked like to you when  you landed. I -- 

A: Oh, I tell you, my first impression was 
that I went through immigration -- see, 
everywhere in the wo rld you would be Mr. 
Meyer or Dr. Meyer, whatever the case may 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 26
 
 
 
 
be. And the guy looked at me , he said, ﬁH
i Walter. Where are you going?ﬂ An d I thought, 
ﬁOh my God, these guys are the FBI, they 
know ev erything about you.ﬂ I was -- I was 
absolutely impressed that he would call me 
b y  my first name. Then, the casual way of 
being -- I remember in Miami at the time -- 
this was new to me, so I couldn™t get over 
these bathrooms, bathrooms for colored pe
ople. There -- There was no such a thing 
anywhere in the world,
 except South Africa. 
Q: Had you been to South Africa? 
A: No, I hadn™t been to South Africa, I went 
to South Africa later, but even South Africa, 
you didn™t have bathrooms for 
colored people, you just didn™
t have bathrooms for colored 
people. But you didn™t have wh ite and -- and -- and colo red. So -- And th e bus rides -- 

Q: You mean where people sat? 

A: Wh-W here people sat, blacks in the back
 and so on, that wa
s totally new to me. 
Q: Did you ever -- ever relate
 that to your experience in Germany, in relation to Jews? 
A: A-Absolutely. I often though
t, they who tell us that we
 should not segregate, we 
should not do th is, look
 at them, how they treat people ju
st because they have a different 
color. That™s -- That™s -- I couldn™t quite co
pe with that. Another big disappointment was, 
I think it was July or August and it was 
hot in Miami and there was a Shriner™s 
convention and I could only find one room, in 
the upstairs of the Grellan Hotel, an old 
wooden hotel, and no air conditioning. And I b
ought some Cokes to put under the sheets. 
And then I went down, I saw a sig n , I said, 
ﬁOh, I™m going to  have a cold beer.ﬂ I had 
never in my  life seen root beer. I thought root
 beer was just another beer. So I drank root 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 27
 
 
 
 
beer, I still have the ugly ta
ste in my  mouth. Anyway , from 
Miami, I went to -- to Dallas 
-- 
Q: Well, you were alone again? 
A: Oh yeah, I was alone. I went to Dallas.
 I h ad known -- see, Braniff Airline had a 
headquarters in Peru. Peru was headquarters for the southern atmosphere, or southern -- 

southern region. Sh e was an employee, and -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: A stewardess, a stewardess. And sh e lived 
in Dallas and she gave me her card, ﬁWhen 
you come to Dallas, I want you to come and 
see me  and I want you to meet my  folks and 
I™ll show you around.ﬂ So I went to Dallas, 
and checked into the White Plaza Hotel, and I 

met her a day or two days later, and sh e sa
id, ﬁWalter, you™re spen ding a lot of money. 
The White Plaza Hotel is an e
xpensive hotel,ﬂ [indecipherable
] it was not too far from the 
airport and -- ﬁWell, why don™t you check your 
suitcases in -- you put your suitcase into 
my car, we™re going to Oklahoma to see my fo
lks, and on the way back, I check you into 
the YMCA.ﬂ That™s the way it happened, an
d the YMCA you don™t have bathro oms in 
your room, you have bathrooms down the fl
oor, and so mehow, wh ile I took a shower, 
somebody swiped my  money out of my  suitcas
e, and I had maybe 10
 or 20 dollars left. 
So, friends of this girl, one da
y they invited me to the first 
football game that I saw in my 
life, which -- which was so boring it was pathetic. 
Then they told that 
-- I wanted to go to 
California, see John Carroll, so they had told 
me that there were opportunities to driv e a 
car. Okay.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape two, side one, of a United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, 
conducted with Walter Meyer, by
 Ginger Miles, on April 28
th
, 1999, in Austin, Texas. On 
the way to  California -- 
A: Well, you know, in every town, if you, 
fo r example, your co mp any moves you to  New 

York, then you leave your car wi
th  the company and th at gets a 
driver that drives the car, 
and generally gets an allowanc
e of 30 dollars for gas, or so
mething like that. So, I got one 
of those cars, a Chevrolet Bel Air, and drove 
from Dallas. And I had to deliver it in Salt 
Lake City. 
Q: To do what? 
A: Deliver the car. 

Q: Oh, deliver. 

A: And upon delivery, I woul
d get 25 dollars. And 
I went through a little town close to 
Denver, called Castle Rock. Policeman stopp
ed me, speeding and crossing th e yellow 
line. And I remember he made it very clear, ﬁY
ou want to pay, or 
you want to see the 
judge?ﬂ I said, ﬁI want to see 
the judge.ﬂ Well, the judge was not there, it™s 11 o™clock in 
the evening, so I went to ja
il. And I remember there was a 
cowboy in jail and I couldn™t 
understand a single word of wh at he was sayi
ng. Anyway , the next day, the sheriff came 
and took me to have so me food and said, ﬁW
ell, we have to keep you another day, we 
have to ch eck on the car first.ﬂ Well, the ne
xt day I went to see the judge and the judge, 
there was no mercy, so it was the ticket plus 
court costs and I had a -- a ring, a gold ring 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 30
 
 
 
 
from Peru, that the deputy sher iff went with me and -- to a restaurant and I told the 
people wh at my  predicament was and somebody
 bought it for five or 10 dollars, I don™t 
reme mb er h ow mu ch . And  so mebo
dy else, realizing that I was a foreigner and I need a 
little help, said, ﬁWell, I tell you what, I™m goi
ng to  contribute some gas to your car.ﬂ 
And I reme mb er an old pump , that you had 
to move like that. And I was on my way. 
Shortly thereafter, a deer jumped
 right into  the car and put a big dent in the fender. And I 
got out and I felt sorry for the deer, and I wa
s going to  catch him and see -- anyway, cars 
went by. Eventually the deer 
jumped back into th
e woods, limping. I 
drove on, police car 
stopped me. They  took me to a little police station. ﬁAnythin
g you want to report?ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ 
ﬁNothing?ﬂ ﬁNo.ﬂ ﬁOkay, you don™t want to te
ll us what happened ?ﬂ I had no idea they 
were referring to the deer, I thought they 
meant that I was in jail the night before 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So I said, ﬁWell, I was in
 jail the night before.ﬂ ﬁOh, we got us a jailbird.ﬂ Well, 
finally they said, ﬁFor not reporting -- When
 you hit a deer and you don™t report, it™s 500 
fine or 50 dollar fine,ﬂ it was a big amount 
for me. And I finally became furious and I 
said, ﬁYou know, I dreamed of this country  
many, many times. Of the liberal way, of 
demo cracy. When  I came to this 
country, nobody ever stopped 
me and to ld me that if you 
hit a deer, you have to  report. There™s no sign or
 anything for that. So , if you want to put 
me in jail, fine.ﬂ There was a captain or lieut
enant, so he said, ﬁLet him go.ﬂ So I was on 
my way again, came to Salt Lake City, deliver
ed the car and they  looked at the fender. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 31
 
 
 
 
They said, ﬁWell, we owe you 25, the repair co
st 18, so here™s seven dollars.ﬂ I had seven 
dollars in my pocket and I was in Salt Lake City
, and I hadn™t slept well, I slept in the car. 
So I asked this auto auction, that™s what
 it was, would they allow me to leave my 
suitcases in one corner there a
nd I wanted to see the city  a 
little bit, so I walked through 
Salt Lake City and I saw a beautiful little house
, room for rent. Oh, it was so inviting and 
I knocked at the door. So neat 
and clean. So I -- ﬁCan I rent your room for a day or two?ﬂ 
ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁOkay.ﬂ And I slept, I slept beautifully
 and the next day I went to restaurant. I 
went to a stationery store and bought some
 drawing paper and a pencil, went to a 
restaurant, said, ﬁDo you mind if I drew your 
picture?ﬂ He said -- I gave it to him, which 
always invited other people to
 look over your shoulder, 
ﬁWould you do mine?ﬂ I said, 
ﬁTwo dollars,ﬂ or one dollar, I don™t rememb er
 how much I charged. So I was there for a 
couple of days, drawing pictures to make 
a little money, enough money to pay for the -- 

for my room. I went back and 
at the auto auction they to
ld me that there were two 
soldiers. They were taking a car to Los Ange
les and maybe they would give me a ride. I 

talked to them, they 
said, ﬁWell, how ab out you pay your
 way and you do the driving?ﬂ I 
said, ﬁFine.ﬂ We drove from Salt 
Lake City to Las Vegas. At some service sta t ion, the 
soldier boys had flirted with
 tw o ladies, I think it was mo ther and daughter and had 

invited th em to have a good 
time in Vegas. So in Vegas, 
they said goodbye to  me, but 
they gave me a few dollars and said, ﬁWhy
 don™t you take the Grey hound bus?ﬂ I took 
the Greyhound bus, and arrive
d in Los Angeles and checked into  the hotel across the 
Greyhound station. And from there I tried to 
reach John Carroll, no 
luck, until finally the

operator told me, ﬁNo more telephone calls, yo
u have to make a deposit first.ﬂ I left a 
suitcase, took bus and went up
 to the San Fernando Valley 
and eventually, oh, the first 
person I met was John Derek, wh o died not 
too long ago, Bo Derek™s husband, with 
whom I rode horses later on. And he told 
me how to find John Carroll, who came, and 
then they took me in a big, 
Buick convertible to Los Ange
les, paid the hotel, get my 
suitcases and cu nup -- come up and stay with
 them and -- but my experience at the 
United States, being in jail and the deer, a
nd so on, if anybody had asked me, and I 
believe people asked me, ﬁHow 
do you like it here?ﬂ I would ha
ve said, ﬁI hate it. I don™t 
like it at all.ﬂ The segregati
on policies and so on. It wasn
™t -- I had not learned enough 
about America to -- 
to understandit.  
Q: What do you mean by th at?  

A: Well, you have to spend a little time in
 America to understand
 why Americans the 
way they are, their way of living, their her
itage, the history of the Black and so on. It 
takes a little while to understand. Anyway, I 
left -- I left Los Angeles and took a plane 
from Burbank to New York and 
then from New York, I went 
to Germany, spent a little 
time and then eventually
 I returned to Peru. 
Q: So, you got to see 
your parents again? 
A: I went to see my parents and that was then -- 
Q: Seven years? 

A: Seven years. 
Q: And had the condition of Ge
rmany ch anged or improved? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 33
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, considerably, because Germany was rebuilt maybe -- maybe throw a percentage 
at you, 60 percent. So, it 
was hardly recognizab le. 
Q: And by now there was a 
government in place? 
A: No, there was still -- yeah, ™54 there wa
s -- oh, I have to do
 some thinking now. 
[inaudible] Yeah, there was now a German 
government, Attanower was chancellor and 
the trains were rolling on time 
and things had normalized.  
Q: And your parents, how was that, 
to be reunited after seven years? 
A: Well, it was -- My father had become my gr
eatest fan, because to him, that a young 
man would be able to leave Germany, and ma
ke it all th e way to America, that was -- 
he™d formed the -- the -- the ad
miration club. And he wanted 
me to stay and work with 
him. He had started a technical translation of
fice. He was doing rather well. Semi-retired. 
In other words, he was his own man now, 
he was not an employee any lo nger. And -- 
But, once you have tasted any pa
rt of America, or for that matter, an y part of America or 
Africa, then Germany, or Europe is not a
ttractive any longer. Thei
r way of living, the 
density of population, the -- the many, little pr
oblems that don™t exis
t here. The generous 
way of living versus existence 
in Europe. So, I couldn™t get 
used to the -- 
to the German 
way of living any mo re, I wanted 
to go back in
to the world. 
Q: From Germany? 

A: Well, from Germany, I went back to Pe
ru, wh ich was -- which had become my  home, 
and oh, I did a numb er of things, but
 ended up breeding some horses and -- 
Q: By now you spoke 
how many languages? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 34
 
 
 
 
A: Oh, wa -- five. I had started a swimming scho
ol in Peru and I was coach of what they  
call the Peruvian  Olympic team. And many peop
le in Peru believed, like people all over 
the world, I assume, th at polio was contagi
ous. And parents of polio affected children 
knew that water was very good
, called hydrotherapy, or wate
r therapy, and they wanted  
me to take care of their childre
n. But the others, wh
en they heard that 
I was going to deal 
with polio children, they
 kind of shied away , being afraid
 that it would be contagious. So, 
I kind of concentrated with 
them during lunchtime. From 12 to two, I had nothing but 
polio affected children. I b
ecame extremely successful, ec
onomically and in ev ery way 
and I then  dreamed of having -- well, I have 
to explain, when  you 
go from Lima east, for 
about -- less than an hour, an
d you come to an area where th
e sun shines, while right in 
Lima, a situation is a little bit like Los Angele
s, the mountains push the clouds back, so 
you have this dampness over Lima
. It never rains, but you don™t see much of a blue sky, 
but you go a little inwards, the 
sky is blue, the sun shines 
and wealthy people begin to 
have beautiful homes there. And in that 
area, I wanted to bu
ild the most elegant 
swimming school, where people 
could have a cup of coffee and watch through one-sided  
glass, see their children and -- and so on. Well,
 I had a child in my school, that learned to 
take the first steps. Her father was presiden
t and owner of one of th e largest bank houses. 
And he to ld me that any money that 
I needed, would be made available. 
Q: Was he grateful to you for -- 

A: Yeah. He just couldn™t get over that I was 
able to make his -- his grandchild walk. So  I 
said, ﬁWell, at least I would like to have 
th e land and maybe then  you can help me to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 35
 
 
 
 
finance the rest, any time.ﬂ We
ll, that was a project that I 
was very mu ch involved with, 
and a friend of mine, a Swiss architect, helped
 me to design something wh ich was partly 
underground. Well, at that time, somebody 
had inquired about the Peruvian passel horse, 
which is a very special breed of horses 
and -- and I was involved a little, I had a few 
horses my self and I loved them because they™revery elegant, they ha
ve a beautiful gait. 
And the horse association™s secretary called me
 and they didn™t quite know how to handle 
this request from the United States and so 
I kind of took over and 
eventually the idea 
developed to take 12 stallions to the United 
States. Shortly before that time, I h ave to 
explain; Peruvian  parents, parents of polio 
children used to go to Warm Springs, Georgia 
with their children. But even
tually, they thought, why not bring a doctor down here? We 
give him a car and a chauffeur, it™s cheaper 
and we don™t lose th
at much time. So, a 
docto r came from Georgia and I was introduced 
to him and he was ra
ther complimentary 
as to the fine work I had 
done, and I told him that everything I did was based upon 
common sense, but I had no schooling in wate
r therapy, but I would like very mu ch to 
pursu e some kind of course. And he invited me
 to come to Warm Springs, Georgia. I 
thought, I get a diploma that
 I can hang on the wall and 
-- and then I know what I™m 
doing, and take it from there. So, I was aske
d to establish contact with horse loving 
people and I made the same mistake that ev
erybody else makes, and that is everybody 
believes that Texas is the horsey-est state in the nation. It™s
 not, California is, by far. So I 
wrote to Texas and oh, I ende
d up with the Good Neighbor co
mmission, the governor and 
eventually , I don™t rememb er how, but I en
ded up with  the San Antonio Ch amber of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 36
 
 
 
 
Commerce, and I was told that we would esco
rt the governor with our horses, during the 
Battle of Flowers parade, which 
is Texas Independence Day. 
Q: So you had two busine
sses going on in  Peru. One was the water therapy and 
swimming and the other was the Peruvian horses. 
A: Yeah, the Peruvian horses was not a business, was - - was a pleasure. 

Q: Pleasure? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But you are now preparing,
 I thought, to Georgia. 
A: Yeah, well, what I -- what I -- what I th
ought was, we take the horses, get a lot of 
money fo r the horses and from there, go to 
Warm Springs, Georgia. And then I return, 

and I have money to  buy land, to build  my  
school and so on. Well, we had sent some 

photographs -- a few photographs of horses 
to San An tonio and th e lady at the San 
Antonio Chamber of Commerce, gave those pi
ctures to a guy who had Palomino horses. 
And he looked at the pictures and they saw th
ey were white -- not all Peruvian horses are 
white, but those particular pict
ures happened to be of -- of 
a couple of white stallions and 
he put two and two together, white, Spanish,
 those mu st be Lipiso tter horses. We had 
quoted so me -- We had given th em a price idea, so I thought that was rather cheap. So I 

got a letter that all the horses are placed. And 
so I said, ﬁWell, they™re sold, let™s go.ﬂ I 
had two horses of my  own and 
others smel le d the business, 
said, ﬁWalter, why don™t you 
take mine?ﬂ And there was an American who 
had a freight line. He
 had an old flying 
boxcar, and we put 12 stallions 
in there, had two helpers.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 37
 
 
 
 
Q: On the plane? 
A: Put them on the plane and we shot each 
one with tranquilizer, so
 they stood like the 
wings. Went to Panama, landed in Panama, we
re a little late, we couldn™t -- we couldn™t 
unload the horses because of quarantine regulati
ons, so we tried to water them, lost a lot 

of time. Then -- In retrospect, I understand th
at he didn™t have a -- a landing permit for 

Houston, but we kind of made
 an emergency landing. One of
 the horses had gone with 
the hoofs, had stood up with the hoofs, broke
 the window of the pl
ane. I mean, it was a 
disaster, but we -- we made it in Houston. We
 were not able to un
load the horses. They 
went from the plane on a truck and they du
sted us and the horses and the quaran tine 
officers were there. It was the biggest mess. 
And then -- I had been told that horses for 
breeding do not pay duty. Well, 
I was told that, but in reality, it™s h o rses for breeding, if 

you™re an American citizen, 
you bring horses for breeding, 
you don™t pay duty, but as a 
foreigner, you bring in horses, 
you do pay duty. We were not 
prep ared to pay. We -- We 
prepared to cash. So, the guy with the big 
truck was told, ﬁDon™t un
load the horses until 
you get the money.ﬂ Jack Sellars was the guy 
with the Palomino horses in San Antonio, 
who was called and he said, ﬁI™ll 
take care of it, just bring th
e horses over here and I give 
you the money to pay for customs and so on.ﬂ 
Well, th-the driver of the big truck, 18 
wheeler, was Black and fell asleep while he 
was driving. So I took over, drove to San 

Antonio, and wh ile he was asleep -- oh, J
ack Sellars was there waiting for us and I 
realized he -- he realized that he had made
 a mistake, we didn™t have Lipiso tter horses, 
and Jack Sellars kind of disappeared. We were
 at the coliseum in 
San An tonio with 12 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 38
 
 
 
 
horse, I said, ﬁUnload the horses, before he
 wakes up.ﬂ And I told  him, ﬁGo back and 
don™t wo rry, we™ll pay sooner or later.ﬂ Well,
 the press came and there I was with 12 
stallion and two helpers, so the president of
 Lone Star Brewing Co
mpany, Harry Jerzek, 
bought three horses, for way below our costs.  People always take advantage. That was 
enough money to send the guys home and I 
was alone with nine horses. And horses eat 
more than people do. So that™s the way it 
started. Harry Jerzek was a very important 
figure and he introduced me to people here
 and th ere and he organized a race, an 

endurance race from San Antoni
o [indecipherable] 34 miles on 
the Fourth of July, 1958. 
And I had coached a cowboy to
 go with me, and we rode ea
ch a Peruvian horse and we 
won. And we were to cash 500 
dollars, but then we were to
ld, ﬁNo, no, no, no, no. The 
500 dollars would have been 
to anybody who would beat 
you. Nobody beat you, so 

there™s no money.ﬂ I didn™t unde
rstand that too well, but anyw
ay. Then, as we arrived, I 
tied one horse up and the little lad y  felt sorry fo
r the horse, because the horse was totally 
exhausted and I gave him wate
r, which was the worst thing to
 do. Th-The horse died the 
next day. So  I lost one horse. Well, there I 
was now with eight hors
es. And well, not too 
long thereafter, I placed some horses, see, 
ﬁC an I leave some hor
ses on pasture with 
you?ﬂ ﬁYeah, sure.ﬂ You become known, 
you make friends, you meet people. And I 

bought an  old truck converted it and made it tw
o stalls. I said, ﬁI™m going to try my luck,ﬂ 
and took two horses to California. And so th
en I spend time in -- in California, placed 
some horses and --

Q: Is this where you met Clark Gable? 
A: Met Clark Gable -- Yeah, I met Clark Gabl
e at the time. I was in Palm Springs and 
Frank Bogartwo was Mayor of 
Palm Springs, twice. Told me once, ﬁWhy don™t you 
come along, we need -- we need an extra bo
wler.ﬂ And so I bowled
 with Clark Gable. 
And I think Zsa Zsa Gabor was on the other 
team and a bunch of 
people. Clark Gable 
was an extremely nice man, as a matter of
 fact. There, I™m with Clark Gable. 
Q: You have a picture of that time,
 or are you going to  [indecipherab le] 
A: Yeah, it™s that time, I show 
it to you. While I was there -- 
Q: Now, who™s in th at picture, the pict ure you just showed me, who was in it? 
A: That™s Clark Gable and his wi
fe, Kay. And, at the time, Cl
ark Gable was trying to lose 
a little weight and he had a bet going on with 
a na -- a guy by the name of Ray Rand and 
whoever loses the bowling will have to lose 
an extra 10 pounds. 
So he wrote on the 
photo, ﬁT hanks for the bowling,ﬂ because we wo
n it, he didn™t have to lose an extra 10 
pounds. Clark Gable was one of the mo st d
ecent man I met in Hollywoods, which is the 
phoniest place on earth, probably. I met man y , so
me were very nice and some invited me. 
I rode horses two or three times w ith Walt Di
sney, who invited me to see Disneyland, and 
not only see Disneyland, but se
e behind, where they repaired
 carriages and did all the 
maintenance work and so on
. That was quite nice.  
Q: I™m assuming this is beyond another trip than the one that you took the two horses. 
A: That was -- That was the -- 
the one with the two horses. 
Q: So, you stayed there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 40
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, well, I came back to Texas, took ca
re of a few things, maybe sold two horses to 
Mr. Masterson in Houston, then
 went back  to California. 
Q: Land of promise? 
A: Yeah. And rode horses with Anthony Qu inn 
and John Derek. We us
ed to practice fast 
draw. And I stayed at John Carroll™s house in
 Granada Hills, with Wade Preston. Wade 
Preston was the star of Colt 45, wh ich was a st -- a dumb, stupid western series. Anyway, 
I met Jack Warner once, 
in the desert. And that was the ti
me when the studios had kind of 
re-organized and would offer y
ou a s --  I think it was 600 dolla
rs that I was offered, 600 
dollars per month fo r five years. 

Q: For what? 
A: To be on contract. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is side B, tape two, of interview with Walter Meyer. 

A: So I™m in California now, a
nd -- and wh at I tried to explain to  you, that studios, once 
they felt that they had discovered a star, or 
so meone they could make a star, they offered 
all kind of monies. The new policy was, let™
s pay them 600 dollars
 per month for five 
years. If they become stars, 
we make a lot of money, be
cause we don™t pay th em any 
mo re than 600 dollars a month. And if they  do
 not become stars, w e don™t lose much with 
600 dollars. That was a time wh
en Burns -- you na -- rememb
er Kookie, with the comb? 
Well, he was trying to make -- he became 
quite popular with the kids. He was making 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 41
 
 
 
 
600 dollars a month. I had sign
ed a contract, because I had 
met Jack  Warner, who invited 
me and said, ﬁWhy don™t you tr
y it out?ﬂ I thought, ﬁWhy not become a movie star?ﬂ So I 
signed a contract, which I broke shortly th erea
fter, because Frank Bogert, my very dear 
friend, one day said, ﬁD o you want to meet Pr
esident Eisenhower? He™s in -- in Indio,ﬂ or 
one of the desert places. And I met President 
Eisenhower, who had st
arted the People to 
People program, which was kind of a foreru nner of the Alliance for Progress. And he 

said, ﬁWhy don™t you do so me go
od will,ﬂ and so on, and that 
appealed to me much more 
than Hollywood. 
Q: Why do you think th
at is? Why do you think you we
re inspired t -- for good will? 
A: Going from North America to
 South America overland? My  
God, this was -- this was 
an adventure. I me an, you could hardly drive. So, and -- 

Q: So, it was to se
rve people from -- 
A: It -- It - -  It -- The -- The -- The philosophy 
behind was to bring people closer together, 
so we would understand better, our brothers s
outh of the border. And so I met, well, all 
the presiden ts going down . And I drove, I had -- 

Q: From? 
A: [indecipherable] with me fro
m Los Angeles. I came th rough 
Texas, then I went all the 
way to Peru. So  I did th at, and of course, by
 that time, I had had a fine opportunity to 
become acquainted with life in the United Stat
es. I had met friends and I had decided that 
I would return and live in Texas, or 
at least try to make a living here. 
Q: Why Texas over California? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 42
 
 
 
 
A: Because I knew more people in Texas than  in California, and -- and palm -- as a 
matter of fact, I wanted to return to Palm 
Springs. There was a lady who wanted  me to 
run a spa, with an emphasis on physical edu
cation and -- but she -- she had a heart attack, 
she died, so that never -- never became true
. So it™s not that I absolutely wanted to 
become the te -- wanted to come
 to Texas, I wanted to come to California, but I also had 
friends here. So eventually
, I returned overland to -- 
Q: In a car? 

A: In a camper, to the United States and came 
to Texas and I was then
 introduced to then 
vice president Linden Johnson at his ranch. 
Q: So th is would have been 1962? 
A: Yes, that sounds good. 

Q: And how did you get to
 go there to the ranch,
 how did that happen? 

A: Harry Jerzek, of Lonestar Brewing Co
mpany, kn-knew Linden Johnson well and felt 
that a man of my  caliber should be -- should 
be welcome by the president and -- well, by 
the vice president then, and so he made arrange
ment and I was told to
 come on such and 
such a day, I think it was a Sunday mo rning th at I met Linden Johnson. 
Q: And your first impressions? 
A: My first impression was the same as the 
second and third impression, that he was a 
rather unpleasant man.  

Q: In what way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 43
 
 
 
 
A: Later, as I came to know him better, and 
traveled with him a couple of times to 
Mexico, he would be the extreme of a charmi
ng man, and would say, ﬁWalter my   man, 
how are you? How is -- How™s the family?ﬂ A
nd th e next day he wo ul
d look through you, 
as if you didn™t exist. A man he
 was, who was used to having
 people do anything for him. 
Took advantage of his power a
nd of course, rememb er those 
who did things for him. But 
not a pleasant man, not my  kind of man. 
Q: Now, I™m -- I™m interested in
 LBJ very much, but I™m also in
terested in the fact that he 
asked you how was your family. Now, is th
is literal, did you by now have a family? 
A: Oh yeah, I married a -- a Peruvian girl when
 I arrived in Lima, I married a girl that I 
had known for some time. 
Q: In what year? 

A: In -- That would have been 1960. 

Q: So by then you we
re with her, and -- 
A: Yeah, well I brought her with me overland. 
Q: You brought her with you? 

A: Yeah. And we had -- we had 
our first child, Heidi, born in
 ™62. So that is why the 
question, how is the family. Matter of fact, 
when he asked me how is the fami ly, there 

was already number two. 

Q: And Lady Bird, di
d you meet her? 
A: Oh yeah, I know Lady Bird we
ll, she™s one of the mo st deli
ghtful ladies that you could 
possibly meet, very considerate. But, you 
know, I know Lucy , I know Linda. I taught 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 44
 
 
 
 
Linda™s children how to swim
. But, when you -- when yo
u ask somebody, ﬁDid you 
know?ﬂ And I think the question sh ould be, 
ﬁHave you met?ﬂ Becaus
e you don™t really 
know those people intimately. 
Yeah, I™ve -- I™ve been
 with Lady Bird 
several times. She 
sent me a picture not too -- too long ago. I 
had -- I had done a Blue Bonnet painting for 
her. So, I™ll show you th at picture in a minute. 
Q: So would you have been in
 -- Did you settle in Austin? 
A: When I came back -- When 
I came back, I settled first in
 San Antonio,
 because the 
president of Peru asked me to represent th
e country as Consul and later as Consul 
General. On e day I had to deliver a speech at 
the Univ ersity of Texas, as a diplomat. And 
my speech must have been so
mewhat radical. Talk about 
the Alliance for Progress. The 
one who had sponsored the speech , was the 
late George Sanchez. They named the 
College of Education after him.
 George Sanchez was one of 
the mo st outstanding, finest 
human beings I ever met. And we became fri
ends. And he said, ﬁI would love to have 
you with  me in graduate school.ﬂ Said, ﬁI do
n™t have any transcripts or anything. I would 
love to jo in you.ﬂ ﬁWell, I would rather 
have you with out transcripts than all these 
monkeys,ﬂ and blah, blah, blah. Well, he wrot
e a letter to the registrar. The letter was 
cosigned by the late William Drake, Professor 
Drake. They asked that I be admitted and I 
assume the registrar didn™t quite
 know what to do with me, but he couldn™t -- he couldn™t 
just do that. I mean, I h ad noth
ing to show. So, they referre
d the letter to the graduate 
dean, who was out of town , so it went to 
the associate graduate dean , Lahor Hu ghes. 
Wonderful guy, who said to himself, according 
to him, if two professor write letter like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 45
 
 
 
 
that and want this guy so badl
y in graduate school, I want to
 meet th at man. So he called 
me and he talked to me for an hour and a 
half and he said, ﬁI™m
 impressed. Would you 
consider it fair if I called for a special co
mm ittee and let the committee decide whether 
you should be admitted or 
not?ﬂ ﬁYes,ﬂ[indecipherable] 
Q: And you had not 
gone to college? 
A: No. So th e committee met and unanimously
 recommended that -- that I be accepted 
and three years later -- oh, I 
drove from San Antonio to Austin ev ery day for three years, 
and got my Ph.D., and -- 

Q: In? 
A: In history and philosophy of
 education. That was the firs
t of three Ph.D.™s. Then I ran 
the center for international education, became
 quite involved in academic life, trying to  -- 
to bring professor from other countries to in
terchange, by way of ed ucation understand 
better, what makes other people tick, about thei
r culture and so on. Bu
t, we didn™t have 
any money. The monies went into aerosp
ace. You couldn™t get any money at all. 
Q: This was early 60™s? Mid 60™s? 

A: Yeah. So, eventually I left
 and then associated with Wa
lter Jenkins, who was Linden™s 
first secretary. This was the t-time
 when Mr. Johnson left Washington. 
Q: Where were you wh
en Kennedy was shot? 
A: On th e way to Houston. 

Q: On th e way to Houston. So we™re ta
lking a -- a year -- a few years after. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041

A: My father had sent a car that I was going to
 pick up at the port 
of Houston. And I had 
a Black guy with me whom I -- I loved dearly
, good mechanic. And we
 stopped in one of 
those little towns between here 
and Houston. And I said, ﬁLet
™s have something to eat.ﬂ 
And the guy said, ﬁHe™s not going to eat 
here, he has to eat in the kitchen.ﬂ  
Q: And so th is was pre-™65? 
A: No, that was ™63. Yeah, ™63. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: That was the day that -- th -- th  -- th -- 
the day Kennedy was kille
d. So I said, ﬁWell, 
do you mind if we,ﬂ-- w-we were four. ﬁCan we
 all sit in the kitche
n together?ﬂ ﬁYeah, I 
don™t mind.ﬂ So -- And I think I was a little n a
sty like. I hope you don™t expect a tip or 
something like that. You know, 
I was a little disturbed that -- 
Q: Were all the others Black? 

A: No, no. There was only one 
Black and the others were a little embarrassed about the 
situation then. 

Q: But they truly let you sit in the kitchen? 

A: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah
. So, as we left, we heard a lo
udspeaker of a radio, President 
Kennedy was shot, and shortly thereafter, wh
ere he™s dead. So th at was on th e way to 
Houston and of course Mr. John
son became president, and -- 
Q: Did you have any dealings w
ith him while he was president? 

A: None whatsoever. So, let™s see, I 
left the university, 
I believe in ™67. 
Q: From the -- You got another Ph .D.? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 47
 
 
 
 
A: Not from this university. 
Q: Oh. 
A: No, no, no. I left the university in ™67, 
I was [indecipherable] wo
rk with Walter and all 
that, become all kinds of different things that
 I could tell you, but I 
don™t believe that we 
want to go into effen 
-- every little detail. 
Q: Had you yet become a resident and citizen? 

A: Yeah, well -- Oh, yeah, I had become a reside
nt, because even before
 I left for Peru on 
this overland trip, before -- I had gone to i
mmigration a numb er of times, to extend my  
visitor™s visa, until one day, th
e offer said, ﬁWell Walter, don™t 
you think that by this time 
you should know wh ether you like it here 
or not?ﬂ Those were his exact words. 
Q: Who said this? 
A: The -- The immigration officer. And I said
, ﬁYes, what can I do about it?ﬂ He said, 
ﬁWell, we can -- let™s go into change of stat
us and make you a resident.ﬂ ﬁOkay.ﬂ Then I 
had to undergo a physical examination and th
ey said, ﬁWell, we cannot okay it, w-we 
have to take another x-ray, because,ﬂ -- the 
x-ray of my  lungs revealed tuberculosis, but 
they didn™t know whether it was active or
 whether it was scar tissue. And I don™t 
remember why I had to go to
 New York, but I said, ﬁW hy ca
n™t I speed up th e process?ﬂ 
And I went to Staten Island and another x-ray 
is taken, they realized it was scar tissue, 
then they okayed 
it, I became a resident. Shortly -- We
ll, we didn™t have any money. I 
think I took a trip once, to Ok
lahoma for President Johnson -- 
Q: While he was president? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 48
 
 
 
 
A: For the former president, I meant. You s
till call him p resident, of course, but he was 
not in Washington any mo re. And wh enev er 
-- wherever I went, oh yes, somebody said, 
ﬁWhat would you like to eat? Wa -- I take 
you here, you know somebody who would 
pick you up at the airport.ﬂ And I went to
 -- ﬁHow about some 
German food?ﬂ And I 
tasted the sausages, I said, ﬁThese are German sausage, these are not American 

sausages.ﬂ Well, I found out that there was 
a German butcher in Dallas. And I had the 
idea of opening a little German restaurant, as
 an investor, in Au
stin, which became 
probably the most succ essful rest a u rant in 
Austin, called Hansel and Gretel. Any of the 
old-timers will tell you, we had classes there, we
 have weddings there. I -- We gave five 
scholarships each year to the Un
iversity of Texas. I mean , it was packed at all times. 
Q: Well, what years were that -- was that? 

A: That was ™69 thro ugh ™74. I never thought 
of running it, but one day I came back from 

a trip and I had a few partners, Walter -- Walt
er Jenkins was one. And I didn™t know how 
much we owed and I    -- I had a certain liabil
ity there. I said, ﬁI™m 
going to  take over.ﬂ I 
took over and -- and it became quite a thing,
 Hansel and Gretel, so I ran that. That 
unfortunately, or fortunately, beca
me part of the divorce settlement. 
Q: From the first, Peruvian wife? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And, so then, wh
en I left the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 49
 
 
 
 
Q: You were divorced in wh at year? 
A: Oh, th at mu st have been ™74 or ™75. Then
, I -- I had learned, in one opportunity, I had 
become a little interested 
in hypnosis. And there was a 
professor of psychology at 
southwest Texas State Univ ersity in San Marc
us. We became friends and I went to see 

him. We had another restaurant there, okay? 

Q: What was that called? 
A: Hansel and Gretel. 
Q: Oh, okay. A bran ch 
of Hansel and Gretel. 
A: Yeah, and in  one room, he sometimes had 
a class meeting in that party room and he 
would have some -- show hyp
nosis a little. So, we became friends and he said, ﬁWhy 
don™t you become a little involved. Your -- You
™re pretty good at it 
and use -- use it in -- 
in -- in therapy.ﬂ That was quite appealing to
 me. But I said, ﬁHell, I need -- I need a 

degree in psychology.ﬂ So I went to the Un iver
sity of Texas and they -- I went before the 
graduate council. ﬁNo, we cannot give you se
cond Ph.D.ﬂ I went to see Charles Lamader, 
the chancellor of the 
university, whom I had met. And he recomme nded that I go to  the 
Univ ersity of Texas in San An tonio. They  
had just begun a program in psychology and 
that I was going to take cla
sses at the University of Texa
s, but San An tonio would give 
me credit for it and well, the way it worked  out, their program was never approved, so all 

the courses they took were for the birds. And 
eventually, I read that  there was a graduate 

school in San Francisco, wh ich had started 
with Pomeroy, who was 
the right hand man of 
-- of Kinsey. Started the Institute for th e Advanced Study of Human Sexuality. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 50
 
 
 
 
became very  much interested, 
because I felt that most psyc
hological problems are sexual 
in nature, if you see human sexuality with a ve
ry broad context. So I wrote and yes, I was 
accepted. Went there and while I was there, I 
was asked to do a little lecturing at Antioch 
Univ ersity. They  had a campus on 
the west coast. And they ga -- they  decided to give me 
credit for the courses I had taken at the Univ
ersity of Texas, so
 eventually I got a 
Master™s degree in psycholog
y from Antioch 
University. 
Q: From wh ich? 

A: Antioch. 

Q: Oh, Antioch. 
A: Antioch. And then eventually, I went to
 Columbia Pacific. They accepted me and 
recognized, of course, my Master™s degree an
d I did so me work with them and got my  
Ph.D . in psychology and ev entu ally I got a 
third one from the Instit
ute for the Advanced  
Study of Human Sexuality, in Sa
n Francisco, so that was my 
third.  Let™s see, where are 
we? So I -- 
Q: Education, we™re doing your education. 

A: Yeah, then I did some research, mostly 
with Dr. Singh, professor of psychology. We 
wrote a paper together with -- was with -- pub
lished in England. And 
then I decided that -
- that I -- w ell, li -- let™s not ta
lk about economy. In the 60™s -- 
no, in the early 80™s, I lost 
about half a million dollars, 
like everybody else, and -- 
Q: Your business was the restaurant and teaching? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 51
 
 
 
 
A: No, the restaurant, I had invested in re
al estate and -- and because of my -- my 
connection with the Johnsons, I had a friend wh
o was Chairman of the Board of -- of the 
Bank of the Hills, which was a bank owned 
by the -- the Johnsons. So, Walter, how much 
do you need? So  I could get an
y amount of money. This wa
s a period of speculation. 
Properties change hands three times per da
y sometimes and each tim
e they went up and 
then everything 
fell, because -- 
Q: When was that? When was the big fall? 

A: The early 80™s. So I lost
 too much money and bankru
ptcy was a little against my 
religion and I began to  paint, as
 a kind of therapy. I had been
 a -- at the Academy of Fine 
Arts in Düsseldorf as a boy. I did a pain
ting of the famous conductor, Carrian.  
Q: Where is he from? 

A: Carrian was the -- the -- the -- the he
ad of the Salzburg or -- the Salzburg™s 
Philharmonic Orchestra. And so mebody from 
Switzerland came to visit and -- and was 
crazy about this painting I had done of Ca
rrian. And I got a letter, ﬁWould you send a 
picture?ﬂ And eventually, to make the story 
short, ﬁWould you se
ll it and how much?ﬂ 
And I remember my daughter was with me, 
I said, ﬁDo you think 
2000 dollars is too 
much?ﬂ She said, ﬁIf y ou sell this painting for 
2000, I™ll never talk to you again.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁWell, how much?ﬂ ﬁ10,000.ﬂ I -- Well, the 
Swiss have money so  I -- 10,000 and th ey 
paid 10,0 00. Then  I was invited to have a 
show in Europe. Carrian asked me to do a 
painting for the Vatican. So I did a painting 
for the Pope and I was asked to come to 
Rome. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 52
 
 
 
 
Q: Which Pope? 
A: The present one, John Paul, and you will se
e me with the Pope on the picture as we 
come down. And then I had several shows in
 Europe. I had a lot of money and I paid 

what I owed. And I have been happy ever since. 

Q: Well, now your daught
er is -- you discussed, is from the first marriage? 
A: Yeah, I have three children 
out of the first marriage, one
 died not too long ago, so 
there is a girl who is, What is Heidi, 35. She 
had three children, she is
 in west Texas, she 
is a rancher™s wife. 

Q: Where in west Texas? 
A: At Saint Angelo. 
Q: I™m from Abalone, so -- 

A: Oh, okay. And th en there™s a boy who is he
re, he™s a very prominent man. God knows 
what all he does. And -- And by sheer coinci
dence, one day on the way to the university, 
on a rainy, cold, miserable day, I was drivi
ng and I saw this student, I assume, missing 
the shuttlebus to the university and I stopped 
and I said, ﬁI™m going to the university, I 
don™t want you to miss classes.ﬂ She became my  wife.  
Q: Your present wife? 
A: She is Chinese and she is probably the 
-- not probably, she is 
without any doubt the 
finest human being I ev er met in my  life. A
nd with her I have Asai, who was born what, 
16 months ago. So  this is the beginni
ng of the final chapter of my life. 
Q: With a new family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 53
 
 
 
 
A: Right.  
Q: That™s wonderful. So, before
 we go now, between your fa
mily and your education, the 
return to -- I can™t say 
it right, Ravensbrück? 
A: Ravensbrück. 

Q: Ravensbrück. Is there anythi
ng else you want to fill in, as 
far as y our history, before 
we return? 
A: Oh, I don™t know. There are so many thi
ngs, but I don™t believe that they would 
contribute much. 
Q: Okay. I™m interested in -- 
in how this -- how you got r
econnected with your roots in 
Germany and with the Holo caust,
 and wh at led you to  return. 
A: Well, after my parents died, my father was 
born in a small, little to
wn -- as a matter of 
fact, my cousin is visiting from Germany. I 
have relatives on both  sides, Germany and 

Belgium. 
Q: Your father died in what year? 
A: My father died in ™73, and so it is not 
that I have a tremendous, strong feeling towards 
my roots. I™m very attached to  the little town in which I spent 
part of my childhood taking 
care of the cows and milking the cows and wh
ere I have some relativ
es left, and where I 
like to go, with their bu is -- beautiful forests. 
Q: That town is? 

A: That -- That little town of
 600 people is called Holleae
rath, H-o-l-l-e-a-e-r-a-t-h. 
Matter of fact, a friend of mine just wrote a b
ook about the Jews in that part. He gave me 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 54
 
 
 
 
his book, the Jews in -- in that part of Germ
any, the development, th
e history of the Jews 
there and so  on, it™s quite, quite interesting. 
Their names and wh at they did and so on. So , 
it is not so much Germany, I™m -- I am as mu
ch attached to -- to, now Libya and to South 
Africa, as I am to Texas, so I don™t 
have these enormous roots, really.  
Q: All right, before we go to  Ravensbrück, I 
think I should turn over 
to the next side -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to the next tape. 
A: Sure. 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 55
 
 
 
 
Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is tape three, side one, of a Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Walter Meyer, conducted 
by Ginger Miles, on Ap ril 28
th
, 1999, in Austin, Texas. 
A: I don™t think so. We can always get toge
ther again. I don™t know, you asked me the 
question, wh at would you -- 
Q: I™d like to focus on the place that was a 
concentration camp, and where you ended up 
and maybe if you could just give us a little 
b ackground about when you were there the 
first time, just like a paragraph or some
thing, and then  ab ou
t your return trip. 
A: Well, the first time wa
s in 1944. Went to Sach
senhausen first an d from 
Sachsenhausen, went to Ravensbrück. Of 
co urse, Ravensbrück was a very small camp . 
Ravensbrück consis
ted mainly of satellite camps. Ra
vensbrück acted as a -- as a 
headquarters. And I went to one of those sa
tellite camps, but they
 all were under the 
umbrella of Ravensbrück.  
Q: This is from prison, to -- 
A: From prison to concentration camp . Concentr
ation camp, to ma -- to me, was actually 
an improvement, because I was in solitary c
onfinement in the pris
on. The concentration 
camp, at least you can talk to others. 

Q: And you were considered a political prisoner? 

A: I was considered a political prisoner. So, in
 that concentration camp, did not mean as 
much as the word implies. To me, it was not
 getting worse. As a matter of fact, it was 
getting a little better.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 56
 
 
 
 
Q: You didn™t fear for your life? 
A: No, I feared for my life, but not -- not of be ing killed, rather, a-a-a-a-at the very end, I 
feared I was -- I was afraid I would die. 
Q: Because you were sick? 

A: Because I was -- I was sick. See, I had trie
d to escape, I had done several things. My 
conduct in prison was so that
 three times I w as put in the bunker, for one month each 
time, with 200 grams of bread and bu
tter, I -- bread and -- and water. So -- 
Q: You were only wishing fo r butter.  

A: Yeah. So that puts you do
wn pretty fast. And then, wher e they needed soldiers, I was 
called and I was told that I s
hould be ready, I woul
d be transferred to a penal co mp any, 
which meant the first line. And I refused, be
cause I was i n  no cond
ition to be a soldier. 
That refusal prompted then, 
the transfer to a camp, to 
a work  camp . And Ravensbrück 
was a work camp, as a matter of fact, one of 
the toughest work camps. 
So, the first time I 
went to Germany, I had decide
d, beyond an y doubt whatsover, 
to visit the warden of the 
prison in which I had spent a
bout a year, and kill him.  
Q: Is this Spider? 
A: Yeah. And I went there. 
Q: When was this that you went? 

A: Oh, that was when I went in -- I assume th
at was when I went back in ™54, after the -- 
after seven years. And, you know, I -- I had 
mad e up  my  min d  to  say, ﬁDo  you  rememb er 
me? May I refresh your memory?ﬂ
 And then eventually I wo
uld have killed him. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 57
 
 
 
 
knocked at the door, and a lady came. I said
, ﬁI come to see Dr. Soikner.ﬂ She said, 
ﬁWell, I™m very sorry, but he
™s no longer here, he moved 
to Hamburg.ﬂ Well, that of 
course changed the whole thing. I was not abou
t now to take the next train to Hamburg, 
because from Frankfurt to Hamburg is a long 
way. So, I kind of -- kind of forgot it. 
Q: May I ask you here, then it had been seve
n years, and even more
 than that from the 
time that you were in the camp
, or in the prison, and you carried this hate. Why - I don™t -
- I know that he was aw -- in -- very, very 
bad to you, but can you figure out any other 
reason wh y you carried this hate toward
 him? Was it more than just him? 
A: Oh, because I don™t believe that -- well, 
I never understand how man can be so evil to 
man. That™s -- That™s -- I have never come to
 understand that. This 
particular man had no 
right whatsoever, to be so cruel, so
 sadistic, to a boy of 16 years.  
Q: He was beating you, and mo re? 

A: Well, he was not beating me personally, but
 he ordered that I be beaten, he ordered 
that I be put into a little cell 
with nothing but two slices of
 bread for -- for four weeks. 
This was the ultimate o f cruelty, but he was 
a sadistic man, who -- and there are millions 
like that in the world. So, he
™s just one of them. But I ca
rried his image with him and -- 
and I still dream of him, once in awhile. 

Q: Still? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You still dream of him? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 58
 
 
 
 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
 yeah. Yeah, I still dream of him. 
Once in awhile I see myself -- I 
do a lot of scribbling with a pencil and I s
ee myself doing his profile. I say, ﬁDammit, 
why do I do this?ﬂ 
Q: What do you mean
 by doing his profile? 
A: Oh, I start drawing and before I know it, I 
have his nose and I ha
ve his profile there. 
Q: Maybe he represented, because I know, fro
m your childhood on, 
with your father as 
mentor, you were anti-authoritarian. So, it™s 
terrible for anyone to be
 in prison, but fo r 
someone who is as anti-authoritarian as 
you, perhap s could he
 have represented 
something greater th
an just himself? 
A: Yes, that is -- that is -- that is very tr
ue. I mean, I was very mu
ch like putting an eagle 
in a cage. I was free. I was supposed to be bo
rn in Texas, the son of a big rancher, see? 
But it didn™t happen that way. So, yes, I ha
ted him passionately, I mean passionately. I 
don™t know in retrospect -- these are all 
good questions, and nobody 
can answer -- what 
would have happened if I 
had killed him? Would I have
 sleepless nights over him? I 
don™t know that, it didn™t happen . 

Q: Well, this brings up a comment that you 
did make, that you ha
ve killed and I just 
wondered, although I know it 
ma y be very unpleasant. Can 
-- Can you say what -- what 
circumstances you were in? 

A: Well, I -- When I went into the wester n zone -- see the Russians -- America n s were 

very nice and th ey picked up scientists 
and brought them over here. Like Werner 
Ferbrown  and son. The Russians would sh ip 
anybody to Russia, an
d they would do the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 59
 
 
 
 
screening in Russia. If you were an enginee
r, fine, if not, well we can -- we can still use 
you. So -- 
Q: They were not as discriminant? 
A: Oh no, no, no. They could use all kinds of
 people. So one day we
 were stopped at a 
border crossing -- 

Q: This was around what year? 
A: Oh, that was -- 
Q: After the war? 

A: -- ™47 -- ™46. End of ™46, maybe. And I 
had a young lady with me who was -- well, in 
my  area I had become somewhat o-of an ex pe
rt. I had gone twice into the Russian zone, 

ﬁLet™s go with Walter, he knows his way.ﬂ Well,
 we were stopped, taken to an  old fo rest 

ranger™s office, and some of the women were 
raped. And we were 
marched, and I knew, 
from here, by train, we™ll end up in Russia. An
d an elderly guard  with a machine gun was 
behind us, and I began to have like epileptic a
ttacks, just to see how he would react. And 
finally I got hold of his gun an
d killed him. So that was one 
of those situations, and we -- 
we ran, and nobody crossed the 
border for a long
 time there.  
Q: How did you travel? What car, what -- 

A: Oh, we were 
running, on foot. 
Q: Just by foot? 

A: Oh yeah. 
Q: My God. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 60
 
 
 
 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. So
 that was -- that was -- that was that.  
Q: Yeah. Well, so in other word
s, it was self defense, right.? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: You were defending 
yourself and others.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: So I think now is a great time to go back
 to your more recent past, and tell first, how 
did you get the opportunity  or the in
spiration to retu
rn to the camp? 
A: I was invited to meet a friend of mine in  Berlin. I have a friend in -- a Belgian friend 

who has a very large factory of making bake
ry equipment, ovens 
and so on, in South 
Africa. And every fo ur years, the largest 
baker™s convention exhibit is in Berlin, 
enormous. And -- And I promised that we wo
uld meet there and said -- you know th at 
close -- I w as always a little hesitant to go ba
ck, I didn™t want to remember an d past is 
past. But he said, ﬁWalter, if you wa
nt to go, I™ll lend you my  car.ﬂ  
Q: How far was it? 

A: Oh, from Berlin, maybe 60 miles, 70 mile
s, 80 miles, something like th at. So, I had 
drove up there, and unfortunately the man™
s camp -- well, the woman™s camp did not 
exist any mo re and th e man™s camp didn™t ex
ist an y  mo re. T h e wo men ™ s camp , at leas t 
the -- the permanent buildings were still there. The -- The prison part, where the women 

were. The barracks were all gone, because th
ey had typhus, everyt
hing was burned down. 
The man™s camp was gone, there was a -- a Ru
ssian military compa
ny was there, so I 
couldn™t even go thro ugh. So th e only thing I 
did is went into the main building, which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 61
 
 
 
 
was the administration building of the SS , and 
got a couple of pamphlet or something. I 
reme mb er t h e lad y  to ld me so me
thing, I don™t remember what 
it was. I said, ﬁN o, you™re 
wrong,ﬂ and I corrected her. And she said, 
ﬁHow do you know?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell , I was 
here.ﬂ And she looked at me. ﬁI don™t rememb
er [indecipherable]ﬂ But anyway , that was 
-- that was it and I remember when I stood ther
e and I wanted to cry and I just couldn™t, 
and I was like -- like a stone figure. I was -- It 
was tough, and it was very difficult to -- to 
drive back. But it was -- it 
was -- it was bad. So -- 
Q: Your thoughts upon driv ing back, or standing there, can you recall any? 

A: Yeah, well, so man y  of the details 
came b ack. When I sa
w an S man shooting 
somebody and when  they threw a -- a head clos
e to the wire. I mean, all these -- all these 
reflections came, andhow I wo
rked hard an d how my  feet 
looked and my   hand were 
blistered, and so , a mo saic of pictures arose 
and I was in bad shap e. I was in bad shape. 
And for some reason -- I don™t 
know whether there™s a medi
cal reason fo r it, I know 
when I went for the interview 
in Washington, I had to  paus
e a few times. I was going -- I 
thought I was going to br
eak down. I didn™t. And I want to cry, but I can™t cry. I have the 
same sensation, but I can™t cry. I have a 
daughter, whom I love dearly, and sh e suffered 
greatly of depression. And a couple of mont
hs ago, she was house-sitting for a friend of 

mine, and found a gun, and put the gun in
 her mouth, killed herself. We had a little 
memo rial and I spoke and ag ain, I had to paus
e and I thought I wouldn™t be able to make 
it. My voice went and well, eventually -- eventu
ally I made it, but those are the situations

that I wish I could -- I would have this nice 
relieve and could cry for awhile, but I can™t, 
so, anyway. 
Q: So you had no one to ta
lk to there? No one who 
had shared the experience? 
A: No. No, no, I was all alone, I was 
-- There™s a church there, but no. 
Q: I™m very interested, Walter, if y ou have me
t Jewish survivors who 
you™ve talked with 
about your experiences? 
A: Oh, I have a -- I have a very, very dear fri
end, Dr. Samuelson. He used to be chairman 
of the language department Sa
n An tonio and gave me a job 
once. I taught languages for 
awhile. We get together once in awhile. He
 wrote a few books and he edited my  book. 

And -- And we philo sophize quite a bit, we have many things in co mmon. I married a 
Chin ese woman, he was married to a Cuban woman an d after the divorce, married a 

Vietnamese girl who is about half his age 
and had three ch ildren with her. A very happy 
man, very bright. So, we
 philosophize, and -- and -- 
Q: Was he in the Holocaust? 
A: Oh yeah, he was in the Holo
caust. He spent quite a bit of
 time in Buchenwald. He is, I 
think Bill is two or three years 
younger than I. He is a Poli -- 
Q: So he was a teenager? 

A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah, he is Polish. So we speak. 
Q: And what do you talk about, in relation to the past? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 63
 
 
 
 
A: We do not speak so
 much about the past, we talk 
more  about huma
nity. You see, 
contrary to  -- of course, every time somebod
y asks me, ﬁWhat did you do in  the war? 
Were you in Germany in the war?ﬂ I said I 
was i-imprisoned. ﬁOh, so you™re Jewish?ﬂ I 
mean, automatically, it™s as
sumed that I™m Je wish, and 
I™m not. I went once to the 
Holocaust museum, up to the arch
ives and I™m registered as a Jew. I said, ﬁWell, wait a 
minute, I™m not Jewish.ﬂ ﬁWell, do you mind?ﬂ 
ﬁNo,ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t give a shit one way 
or the other.ﬂ But they have me as a Jew 
there. The m -- The -- 
The -- The -- The name 
Meyer, could very easily be Jewish, very eas
ily. It™s an old, Roman name, I mean, it™s a 
Hebrew name to start with, 
like Golda Meir, it™s -- it™s ca
lled the enlightened one. We 
talk more about humanity, ed
ucation and ev en though Jews
 do not allow you to make 
comparison between persecution, systematic
 killing of Indians in
 the United States, 
depression and persecutio
n and killing of Blacks, the histor
y of the British in the world, 
the history of the French in the wo rld, the 
history -- I mean, there™s hardly a country  in 
the world that can say we have never done
 anything wrong. So, the Germans were the 
only ones who did mass extermination in su
ch a scientific way and it depends a little 
upon how you want to lo
ok at things. Is this -- Is this 
indicative of the German scientific 
mind, or is this the ultimate degree of cr
uelty? I mean, th ere are many ways of -- of 
looking at things. Are Germans by nature mo
re cruel than others? No, hell no. I think 
French are mu ch mo re sadistic 
than Germans are, as a whole.
 I look at the history of the 
Jews, ha -- how they  have been prosecuted. 
I look at the church , having done nothing 
whatsoever to help alleviate things. So, I am 
mo re a me mb er o f  th e 
party that accuses the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 64
 
 
 
 
world, rather than pointing the fingers at on
e or the other. And I™m pretty sure that I™d 
find as many sadistic Israelis 
as I find any -- an ywhere in the world. I don™t believe that 
I™d want to be associated with
 a typical Marine Sargent.  
Q: Of any race? 
A: Of any race. American or whatever. An Am
erican Marine Sargent is a son of a bitch 

from way back. He™s a killer. 
Q: Trained to be. 
A: Trained to be, right. And he™s not goin
g to ask mu ch. If you tell him -- I mean, you 
know, in -- in -- in -- in Mi
ssissippi [indecipherable] deputy says, ﬁHow about killing a -- 
killing us a nigger this w
eekend?ﬂ Can you understand? 
There are people like that 
everywhere. The Germans went a little too far, a
nd of course, if I were a Jew, I would not 

allow for this to be forgotten. I fully understand that. 

But you have to go a little beyond that, and I 
understand. I remember once I wrote a letter 
to Elie Wiesel, the very famous one, when  he protested that  Reagan was going to go to 

the Bittburg cemetery, where SS so ldiers wereinterred. That was -- And I tried to correct 

him, said, ﬁSS were not all killers. Some SS 
were volunteers. Some were recruited into 
the SS. They had no choice. 
But not every SS member kille
d Jews, or killed anybody. So 
I don™t know whether those in
 the cemetery were killers
 o r were totally innocent 
bystanders.ﬂ And I encourag ed. I wrote him, he  never wrote back. I said, ﬁWhy don™t you 

go with Mr. Reagan and hold
 your hand and start so
meth ing new? Start a peace 
movement. Show them that you™re willing to 
give it a try, instead of, no we have to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 65
 
 
 
 
remember, we have to remember.ﬂ You don™
t do mu ch good by doing that. Certainly you 
remember, certainly you -- you want to prev
en t things from happening ag ain. Look at 
Yugoslavia. We don™t talk mu
ch about Rwanda, where milli
ons of people got killed -- 
slaughtered, not killed, slaughtered . Because th ey™re Blacks, what the hell ca -- who gives 
a damn, right? Yugoslavia™s a little closer, th
ey™re, in quotes, civilized people. I mean, up 
in the 20
th
 century, people kill each other for religi
on in Ireland. You [indecipherable] it™s 
-- how is it possible, huh? People do weird th
ings. I never, never will understand to what 
extreme man can go in
 what he does to his fell
ow man. That™s beyond me. 
Q: Do you make any sense or
 can you connect the shooti
ng in Littleton, Colorado on 
Hitler™s birthday? 

A: Oh, I think -- I think that™s a little ove
rplayed. I -- I don™t believe that Hitler has 
anything to do with it whatsoev er, I don™t belie
ve so. I look at Co lorado, it does not -- I 
mean, it -- it™s -- it™s horrible, and to hear
 that one of the kille
r™s mother, after it 
happened , had her hair done in
 front of the school, you know
, like ‚I don™t give a damn.™ I 
think that the horrible thing is
 in the United States, and thr
oughout the world, is that the 
family, which was the strongest unit, is totall
y falling apart. So kids grow up, no father 
image, single parent. They grow
 up without anything whatsoever, and try to get attention. 
I tried to get attention on the streets. When
 you need attention, 
you need attention, 
whether it™s negative or positive, doesn™t make any difference. So, I can understand what 

has happened in Co lorado. Do  
I like it? Of course I don™t like it. And I feel sorry for the 
victims, of course. But, it is an outcome of 
a ruthless, non-family 
life, which has -- I look 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 66
 
 
 
 
at my  -- my  -- our nanny, who™s a lovely
 wo man from Croatia, but she would probably 
pay money to see Jerry  Springer. Have you ev
er seen Jerry Springer on -- on -- on -- on -- 
on television? 
Q: No. I -- I know who he is. 

A: You ought to see the progra
m, what they see and there 
are millio ns of people standing 
in line to watch that. 
Q: Why? 
A: Why? Because people love to see se-sensa
tional things. Like in the west, originally, 
they stood in  line to see a hanging. That™s 
the way the world is, we™re just terrible 
animals. 

Q: But it™s interesting though, your family --
 your first family is still close to you in  
Austin, around -- around the Au stin area, isn™t that right? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: So you stayed connected -- ve
ry connected with that family. 
A: Yeah. Don™t -- Don™t -- Don™t -- Don™t forget
 that I have been longer in Texas than 
anywhere in the world. I™ve b
een much longer in Texas than
 I had been in Germany. I 
know how to speak Ge
rman, of course, but I have be
en here for -- for a lifetime. 
Q: What is it about Texas that 
-- do you th ink appealed to you? 
A: I love the -- the wide, open sp aces. People 
are friendly, whether that friendliness is a 
very profound and truism, or you never know 
if somebody says good 
day to you, does he 
really mean  for you to have a good day, y
ou don™t analyze that. People as a whole are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 67
 
 
 
 
very friendly, eager to help. I have many frie
nds here. Life is relatively easy. Climate is 
rather pleas -- a little h o t in the summer, but 
not that bad. I have, of course, one of the 
choice homes in -- in -- in -- 
in this area, with a gorgeous view and I can go swimming 
any time. I have a boat. It™s not too far from 
anything. You take a plane, you™re in New 
York in no time. You go to Eur
ope. We have a new airport th
at will be in operate in a 
couple of weeks, or three weeks. 
Q: I noticed that you have a picture of you
rself with Ann Richar
ds, could you say how 
you know her? 
A: I met A nn Richards when
 she was county commissione
r. She is one of the mo st 
delightfu l women in  the wo rld. Sh arp as can 
be, humorous as can be. Matter of fact, she 
wrote -- there™s Ann Richards. 

Q: Oh. Would you read her -- 
her comments ab
out your book? 
A: Yeah, ﬁWalter Meyer is a remarkable, cour
ageous man, who surv ived  the horror of  
Nazi Germany and made America his home. 
His considerable charm and talent shine 
through in this wonderfu
l volume. Ann Richards, fo
rmer Texas governor.ﬂ 
Q: Oh, that™s wonderful. Well, we haven™t 
discussed mu ch about the book, ab out your -- 
your -- anyone who writes a book, I know, as 
a writer, has to be extremely mo tivated and 
I wonder what motivated you to do this. 

A: Over a period of years, 
people, knowing a little about my adventures -- and some of 

them are very extreme, ﬁWhy don™t you 
write a book, why don™t you write a book?ﬂ 
Well, I wrote and then I said to myself, ﬁT
his looks a little too 
much like Hollywood,ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 68
 
 
 
 
and I threw it away. But you get older and olde
r and said, ﬁI should really write,ﬂ and 
then I begin more seriously, 
and one day I ran into a gra
duate student, a very fine, 
talented writer. I said, ﬁYou wa
nt to give me a hand?ﬂ A
nd he wanted to make a little 
extra money. So he helped me and we then
 became very disciplin
ed. And it was to be 
published by the Ho locaust Museum, and it ha
d to go through three editors there, and 
they all okayed it. And then 
it went through to -- two inde
pendent sources in Germany 
and they  had to decide whether the 
book was a contribution to  the --  
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: -- and -- 

A: And so the Holocaust Museum
 decided not to publish it. 
Q: Based on? 

A: Based upon the fact that two independent
 sources in Germany 
had decided that the 
book did not represent a new contribution to 
th e history of concentration camp s, and so 
on. So then I had a -- a list -- I think Mr. 
Gelb from -- he™s one of the editors there. 
Q: At the museum? 
A: Michael Gelb, yeah, gave me a list, a
nd I wrote to one and two and it™s not only 
difficult to write a book, but it™s very difficu
lt to find a publisher, I can tell you that. And 
-- But I had a list and there was an 800 numb er
 for the University of Missouri Press. I 
called the 800 numb er and said, ﬁT his is Dr. 
Meyer, may I speak to the director?ﬂ Well, I 
assume that  she thought maybe 
there was an accident or some
thing, a doctor needs to go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 69
 
 
 
 
through, so I talked to the director, I said
, well -- I had written a query letter and I said, 
ﬁMay I read the query letter 
to you over the phone?ﬂ Said
, ﬁYeah, please.ﬂ We kind of 
liked each other over th
e phone. And after I fi
nished the query letter, 
she said, ﬁI want to 
see the man u script.ﬂ So I send the manuscrip
t and two months later she called and said, 
ﬁWell, it™s always so difficult 
for me to tell p eople that, unfor
tunately we have to turn 
down their,ﬂ blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I sa id, ﬁHere it comes.ﬂ ﬁBut in your case, it has 
to be published.ﬂ So, University of Missouri 
Press said leave everything as it is, and so 
this was it, so -- 
Q: They didn™t ask for any changes? 
A: No, no ch anges whatsoever. Th
ere™s a picture here, at least there -- yeah, there is one. 
I should find it. So this came out just a few weeks ago, and I was -- 

Q: How many? 

A: Just a couple of weeks ago. 
Q: Oh, congratulations. 
A: Yeah, well, thank you, and it seems to be doi
ng rather well. And, so that™s -- there  I 
am when I was 16. 
Q: Oh, and what does the uniform? 
A: It™s the Navy, because I was -- I wa
s in the Hitler youth and the Hitler youth was 
divided and -- this is Lovey. Rememb
er when I told 
you about Lovey? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: That™s when I was a sailor on the 
Parkhaven, shoveled coal, you see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 70
 
 
 
 
Q: And he was from where? 
A: He was from Cura
ao. 
Q: Cura
ao. 
A: From the Dutch West Indies. So that™s th
e book th at just came out and I have been 
asked to do a little tour 
for Barnes and Noble. 
Q: Will you be coming to New York? 
A: God knows, maybe yes. 
Q: I imagine. 

A: Yeah, and -- 
Q: You™ll have some tough audiences there. 
A: Yeah, yeah
, yeah, yeah. 
Q: That™s where the 
tough audiences are. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Ph.D.™s will really help. 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Well, I have a few questions from Arwin 
Donohue for you, so -- follow-up on your 
life, I think. 

A: All right. 

Q: Unless you wanted  to add something about 
the book, or thoughts that you™ve had. I 
know that finishing a book is sort of lik
e, I™ve been told , having a baby. You know, 
afterwards, there are all sorts of -- well, ther
e may be depressions and then th ere may be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 71
 
 
 
 
joyful experiences, or connections with othe
r people. Were you reco nnected, so far, with 
anyone from your past in Germany? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you expect that? 

A: No, I have contact to my cousin here, 
to another cousin, who™s coming to  visit me 
with his wife. But others, don™t forget, I™m goi
ng to be 73 years old. Most of th e people 
are dead. So there are not too 
many people round there. I have
 one friend who is close to 
death now. He is a year younger than I and we 
used to have this Jewi
sh boy hiding in our 

basement. We never understood why they  were
 against him. We were talking about that 
last time I saw him. But he is pret
ty mu ch in bad shap e, everything. 
Q: What is his name? 
A: It™s Eddie Wylant. He carries a little 
bag with him, you kn
ow, his kidney don™t 
function well, God knows. So  -- 
Q: I wanted to ask you now that we™re on th
e physical, cause I kn
ow you were wa -- you 
had TB an d you were beaten a
nd you discuss in the ™96 interv
iew, pain in your legs. Have 
you had physical problems that result 
-- that come back
, from that time? 
A: The only thing that is evid
ent is that as a consequence of
 malnutrition, nerv es in my  
legs have suffered greatly. And so, I cannot st
and for a long time, then I begin to dance 
around and try to find -- especi
ally  on concrete floors, okay? But, other than that, I™m -- I 
mean, I had back surg eries, but I cannot stan
d here and look you stra
ight in th e eyes and 
say the surgeries can be attributed
 to my being imprisoned. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 72
 
 
 
 
Q: What about your experience, 
not just being in prison, but 
in watching -- in getting sort 
of a close up, but outsider™s view of -- of
 what happened in the Holocaust to Jewish 
people, is there anything beyo
nd th e physical that you thi
nk had info rmed you, that 
informs your decisions, as to where to go an d wh at to do and wh at your interests are, 
from that time. 

A: Well, my interests right now have to 
be, I have given the children I have -- the 
children I have left, about as liberal educa
tion as possible and I have never allowed any 

form of segregation to exist 
in my family. And the daughter
 I have now will grow up to 
be as liberal, as objective, as understanding 
as possible. Of course, I have no voc -- no -- 
no contro l over wh ether she going to -- going 
to end up at the age 
of 25 with  drugs or 
something like that. I-I hope no
t. Other than that, I look left
 and right and unfortunately, 
whenever you see something like the Holo
caust, you -- you -- y
ou would th ink that 
something like that can never happen again 
and I wish I could believe that, but I can™t. 
So, atrocities in the world are 
not a dampener, or not a way to
 tell people, ﬁLet™s go into 
mass education and prevent this from happen
ing again.ﬂ No, no, there are many, many 
prisoners or leaders who said, ﬁLet™s keep 
people as stupid as possible, because it™s so 
much easier to govern 
them. Let™s create some sort of
 sickening nationalism and let™s 
teach them that the Albanians,
 or the Jews, they are no go
od, they  are responsible for 
your bleeding, they  are responsible for your
 bad economy, they are the ones.ﬂ I see it 
again and again and again. So, humanity 
has not changed and will not change, unless 
there is some -- some 
kind of enlightenment. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 73
 
 
 
 
Q: In considering the small daughter of yours,
 who I saw, and her ge
neration, wh at would 
be your greatest hopes that she ma y be? I mean
, I know the greatest fear might be drugs, 
but the greatest hopes that she might take aw
ay  with, say when  she reads her father™s 
book? 
A: That she will become co
mpassionate, understanding. That she will ask a thousand 
questions why, why, why, in
stead of accepting blindly. Th
at she will learn about other 
cultures and grow up to  be the kind
 of person that you mu st love. 
Q: But, I wanted to ask you some of the fo
llow up questions from Arwin and one of them 
is your -- your birthdate, and your 
father™s and brother™s full names. 
A: My birth date is 31
st
 of May, 1926. My  brother™s 
full name was Paul Meyer. My 
father™s name was Paul Meyer. My mother™s
 name was Henriette Meyer, and her maiden 
name was Sommerhauser, S-o-m-m-e-r-h-a-u-s-e-r. 

Q: This is an interesting question, I think, 
that you mentioned that, in your ™96 in terview, 
that during the time you were in Ravensbrück,
 which I™m only pronouncing th is as an 
American child, in the quarr
y, there was a hierarchy of
 nationalities among prisoners. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: At what rung of this hierarch-archy 
were you and other Ge
rman pris-prisoners? 
A: At the highest level. 
Q: The highest level? 

A: Mm. 
Q: You were privileged at all, because of your nationality? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 74
 
 
 
 
A: No, th at was not privileged. It just happen
ed to be divided like that. It had nothing to  
do with -- wi-with -- with a pr
ivilege. I mean, we were -- we were picking rocks. 
Q: Oh, yeah. 
A: So that was not -- that was not the -- the 
highest level was just as bad as the lowest 
level, so -- 

Q: Were there any Jews in the camp? 
A: No. 
Q: So, was there mixing betwee
n ethnic or national groups? 
A: There was -- There were -- There were quite
 a few Russians, Poles. When I say there 
were no Jews, that I know, okay? There were 
some, I u nderstand, some French prisoners 
of war were there, and maybe a few Czechs, and so and so.  

Q: I really like this next question, it™s, list
ening to you talk about your experiences during 
the war, Arwin is struck by what
 seems to her to be a very 
optimistic attitude. Is that an 
accurate assessment? Did you feel optimistic at a
ll at that time, or did it come back later? 
A: Well, Miss Donohue, I have been asked th
at question many times, and there seems to 
be evidence that I am 
optimistic, but I want to make a co
rrection. My optimism is not -- is 
an innate thing. In other wo
rds, I do things not because I™m optimistic, but because I do 
not think that the consequenc
es ma y be devastating. Y
ou understand? People prepare 
themselve and say, ﬁIf I do this, if I get caugh
t, oh my  God, what am I going to  do?ﬂ I let 
things happen and then I think, ﬁW hat am 
I going to  do now?ﬂ So, I don™t know wh ether 
optimist is -- is -- is an  accur
ate word to describe me. I th ink I am rather -- I would rather 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 75
 
 
 
 
use the word irresponsible, b
ecause in my  past, I have been
 too -- playing with fire too 
much, and that is an irresponsible act. Oh, 
I™m going to get away 
with it, ah, nobody™s 
going to  catch me, or nobody™s going to see me and I have no fear. But there™s a 
difference between having fear 
as a consequence of intelligent 
thinking, or having no fear 
because I just don™t give a da
mn. I™m -- I™m -- I™m -- So, I™m
 an adventurer really, I™m a 
Gypsy by -- by -- by sheer and we
ird conglomeration of genes. 
Q: And speaking of genes,
 did you say something abou
t no Jewish blood for five 
generations? Does that indicate -- 

A: I had to prove that. 
Q: How did you prove that? 
A: Well, you had to pr
ove that in Germany. 
Q: Oh, so you don™t know wh
at happened befo re that? 
A: Before five gener -- hell, no, I could have
 a lot of Jewish blood, but no. You had to 
prove that for five generations, you were Aryan. 

Q: Had to  prove to whom? 

A: To the govern ment. 
Q: When  did they ask? Di
d they  ask your parents? 
A: Well, when you -- when you
 -- for example, were you a member of the Hitler youth. 
And in Germany, you 
see people in Germany like -- like 
in other European  countries, 
they were born here an
d they died here, so it™s -- it™s -- 
it™s very -- it™s not like America, 
say, ﬁWhere did your grandfather come from?
ﬂ ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ In Germany, you know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 76
 
 
 
 
where your grandfather, your great-grandfat
her, where they all came from, see? My 
cousin lives in the house in
 which my  father was born and th at existed in 1590. 
Q: Your cousin that™s visiting here? 
A: This cousin here. 

Q: Wow. Well, that™s the sense of
 -- Is he a similar age to you? 
A: No, she is much younger -- 
Q: She. 
A: -- than. She is 56. 

Q: Uh-huh. You didn™t know her then? 
A: Oh yeah, I™ve known her forever. 
Q: Oh. 

A: I knew her as a baby. 

Q: That must have a -- a very -- a feeling of
 closure, doesn™t it, to have a relative from 
that time, and -- 
A: Yeah, she is very close 
to me, she is a good wo man and sh e lost her husband with 
cancer and her son was involved
 in a head-on collision, so 
he was in coma for three -- 
three months. And she is a fine, fine, fine 
woman. Good woman an d 
my  parents loved her 
to death. 

Q: When  did your parents -- I know you to ld me
 about the death of 
your father, but you 
didn™t -- When was the last time 
you saw your mo ther and father? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 77
 
 
 
 
A: I saw my -- my father maybe six months 
before he died. I went to Germany rather 
frequently. And my mother died in 80 ti -- no, 
my mother died in ™79. And I saw her in 
the last weeks of her life. 
Q: Here™s an interesting obse
rvation by Arwin, on relations
hips with  your parents after 
the war, particularly your relationship with your
 father, whom you seem to have seen in 
the early days as the chief force against wh
ich you rebelled. You actually mention now 
that, or that in ™96 interview, that you ar
e exactly like your fath
er. What do you mean by 
this? Is this possibly a tie-in with his feeling 
-- your feelings about authority in general, 
after the war and today? 
A: W-Well, my father thought that beati
ng me up would conform me. If he had a been 
somewhat of a psychologist, 
he would have said, with a 
little sugar and a little candy, 
Walter is g o ing to be a fantastic h u man being.
 But he beat me up until I was blue and red, 
a-and at the age of 12, if you had given me 
a gun, I would have s
hot him. When he saw 
me aft er the war, from then on
 he tried so hard to undo 
and redo and he was the most 
unselfish man I ever met. And he tried to give
 me his rig h t arm and his left arm, until one 
day I told him, ﬁYou cannot buy my love. Just fo
rget all the bullshit. I -- I -- Let me try to 
forget.ﬂ And I came to love him, and I miss 
him. I wish he would show up so me bi -- 
weekend. Death is a kind of miserable thing,
 anyway. So, when I sa
y I am very much the 
way he was in many ways, I™m a rather unselfi
sh person. I never buy things for me. It™s 
my  wife who buys a new shirt or something,
 I don™t go. I don™t particularly care how I 
look. I don™t particularly care what I eat. I 
don™t need any luxury 
whatsoever. I don™t need

a new car, as long as the one I have runs. So, 
in that respect, I™m 
mu ch happier with -- 
with beans, than I am w
ith -- with -- what do the Ru
ssians have, the fish eggs? 
Q: Caviar. 
A: With caviar, yeah, you know
? So, my stape is -- my tast
e is simple. So, I am as 
impatient as he was. I™m a little -- I 
tend to be violent, as -- as he was. 
Q: In -- In what way? 
A: Violent especially by, if I see a uniform
, unifo rms have a tremendously bad impact on 
me and when they -- well, you know, not to
o many years ago, I had a problem with a 
policeman and I broke his -- his -- his -- his  
nose. You don™t do that , you ought to control 
yourself. It™s difficult for me to control myse
lf. It gets better as I get older, okay? So, I 
have many of my father™s traits, b u t I™ve also
 let -- like my mother, I have all the artistic 
blood from my  mo ther and so on, and so on. 
Q: You said that she was writing? 
A: She wrote beautifully and sh
e wrote poetry and she was oh, 
she lived in a -- in a -- in a 
world of art, in a world that doe
sn™t exist. She was a dreamer. 
Q: Where did you have a ch
ance to read her writing? 
A: Well, she wrote a bunch of th ings that I 
have. How she met her husband. Everything is 
written in -- Oh, she had a beautif
ul choice of words, and -- 
Q: Journal? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: In German? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 79
 
 
 
 
A: In German, of course. 
Q: Do you think that your -- your 
ability to paint came from her? 
A: I -- I have to assume so, because there were
 a few painters in my family and sculptors 
on her side. 

Q: There are? 

A: Yeah, not on my father™s side. 
My father™s side are all farmers. 
Q: That came in handy in your many jobs. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Both  farming and painting. 
A: Yeah. This, by the way, is a painting I did 
of my father. That™s my father there on the 
wall.  

Q: That™s a beautiful painting. 

A: Mm. [inaudible] 
Q: Are you still painting now? 
A: Yeah. I did a pain ting not too lo ng ago 
that was shipped to Germany, yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: That™s a very -- a very major gift, I think. 
A: Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
Q: And I want to see what else we™ve gotten to -- 

A: Okay, hold it fo
r [indecipherable] 
Q: All right. Now, who is this? 
A: Lady Bird.

Q: Oh. And this is your painting that you -- 
A: That™s the painti
ng in the back, yeah. 
Q: That she has, uh-huh. ﬁTo Walter Meyer, with so many thanks, Lady Bird Jo hnson.ﬂ 

When was that? 

A: Oh, maybe a year ago, some
thing like that. There is Lady 
Bird up there. And there is 
the president with his fa
mily, and there™s the pres
ident with his family. 
Q: And the pope, is that the pope
 up there? That™s the cardinal. 

A: No, that™s Cardinal Spellman. 

Q: But you haven™t conti
nued your cut -- your conn
ection with Catholicism? 
A: Oh no, no, no, no. 
[inaudible]. I™m not -- I am not a 
-- I am not a church-going man. 
Matter of fact, I have many problems with th
e church. So that™s Ann Richards, ﬁTo my 
friend Walter Meyer.ﬂ Let™s see, who else is
 there that you might 
be interested in? 
Q: Clark Gable would be mine -- my -- my first choice. 
A: Clark Gable [indecipherable], yeah, yeah . We
ll, there™s Bo Derek up there, see I™m in 
the picture above my father th
ere, I™m with Bo Derek.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Those are pictures where I™m on horseb
ack. You see up there? Those are all horse 
pictures. 
Q: From the movies, or --

 81
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, they are partly. And this one here 
is when  Governor Connelly, after he was shot 
-- I was asked to go to Germany to  promote 
tourism to Texas. And I went with Senator 
Richter and this is when we ca
me back, he was shot, so this was in ™63, ™64. Yeah, ™63. 
Q: I don™t know if I should just ask wh at does your wife do? 
A: She is a computer engineer. She works for Dell. 

Q: So, you™ve given so mu ch, I think -- a qu
estion which I think is
 interesting is, going 
back -- you mentioned going b
ack to your father™s -- your mo ther™s -- your -- the 

hometown where you grew up. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And I™m wondering if you ev er met, earlie
r -- on your earlier trips, did you meet any 
of the townspeople that you had known then
 and did you discuss 
-- did they  know what 
had happened to you, or di
d they  know wh at had happened in the Holocaust? 
A: Well, you have to understand that there ar
e people that certainly they knew about me, 
and there are people, or there was one in -- ma
n in particular who threatened to denounce 
my father for having listened to the BBC.
 When I came back, I was told, ﬁDo you 
remember so and so?ﬂ Well, my attitude was th
en, ﬁOh, let™s forget him.ﬂ As a matter of 
fact, my father is the one 
who encouraged me to ask fo
r rehabilitation from the German 
government. Reparation money. I said, ﬁOh, th
ey can™t buy my  health back  and so on.ﬂ 
Finally, when I came to Germany, he insisted 
that we go to an attorney who was trying to  
reinstate me because I 
had missed the deadline. 

Q: What year would this have been ? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041
 
 82
 
 
 
 
A: I don™t remember, in the 50™s, I assume
. Anyway, the Germans 
rejected me, because 
in Germany, if you miss the deadline, you 
miss the deadline. And 
we brought forward 
that I was in the jungle of Peru and I had no
 idea that there was 
a deadline. No , no way. 
And so I said, ﬁI™m going to try it myself, just
 to see how the Germans handle this.ﬂ And 
I wrote to, and had quite a corre
spondence with a memb er of parliament, a me mber of the 
bunderstock, who was head of th e judiciary, 
I think. And he made 
it very clear, ﬁSorry,  
Walter, you missed the deadline.
ﬂ So, in Germany, you miss
 the deadline, in America 
there are exceptions to the rule
, in Germany th ere are not. So, I forgot all about it and the 
people -- the people, some of them died, 
some of them I didn™t want to have any 
association with wh atsoever. And, you know, 
Germans tried very hard
 to claim that, ﬁOh 
no, we were never Nazis, we we
re always against it,ﬂ and so on. But that™s what you have 

to expect. Nobody™s going to
 say, ﬁYes, I™m guilty.ﬂ Peopl
e don™t do that. So, you know. 
Anyway -- So, I have not -- I know people 
who benefitted greatly during the Hitler 
regime, and do I want to make a big issue, do 
I want to? No, I -- You have to know that 
whatever you do has some ki
nd of positive result. If not, why touch it? It doesn™t do any 
good. 
Q: Well, thank you so mu ch. Is
 there anything else you want
 to add? I -- I™m sure there 
are many things, but -- 
A: I don™t know. You tell Miss Donohue, if 
she has any questions, to write them down 
and send them to me and I will answ
er them to the best of my ability.
