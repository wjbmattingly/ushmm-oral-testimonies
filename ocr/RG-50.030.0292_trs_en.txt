Beginning
 
Tape One 
Question: Okay, I need you to begin by stating your name, where you were born, 
when you were born.  

Answer: Many years ago. I™ll start?  

Q: Yes.  
A:Oka y, my name is 
Œ  m y real name when I was born is 
Abraham
 
Resnickowitz
(ph). Actually Œ people know 
h i m by 
Œ know 
me by 
Abe
 
Resnick
, 
actually. But that was my given name at t he time, ninetee Œ I was born 1924, 
February 27th. I was born in a small city Œ small town in the eastern part Œ 

northeastern part of 
Lithuania
 by the name of 
Rokiıkis
. It was a relat ively small  
town. It was actually a county more than a town, in the sense that there were 
some 

surrounding towns Œ smal l towns which, most of the time, our town was famous in 
having a large Œ not conventions, but I would say markets. Peopl e used to come 
from all over because you see, 
Lithua ni a
 is a
gr
 Œ was a an agricult ural 
[indecipherable]
 coun -country and in the larger towns we used t o have twice a 
week
 markets, whereby people used to bring their agricult ural products to that Œ to 
the Œ to the city and Œ and they were sold at the Œ at the markets. I was born in a 

family that m y father, who was Œ  who came from a different town, he was also in

the Œ he fought in t he Independence War of 
Lithuania
. And due to the fact that he 
was fighting for Lithuanian suverani Œ soverei gnty, he was given two choices; one, 

a farm or a governmental job. He decided what's a Jewish boy going t o do on a 
farm? So he Œ he decided to take a governmental job. And the job was, basically he 
was a inspector Œ insurance inspector. Insurance was, in 
Lithuania
, 
a 
Œ belonged to 
the government and regulated by the government. So he came t o thi s small town. 

First of all, he came to the town, i n the beginning, as a Œ as a bookkeeper, 
an
d he 
worked for a company. And then, of course, he met m y mother who was a native, 

and a fourth or fifth or six generation of peopl e who lived in 
Rokiıki s
. That means 

my
 great-grandfather and my great-great-grandfather, they were est ablished there 
for Œ for 
many years. A
nd after m y father married 
[ind
ecipherable]
 he opened up 
his own business and the office was normally Œ office was in Œ in the house. I have 

a very nice house and t he address of the house Œ of course, that's irrel ev Œ irrelevant. 

Then when Œ  
Q: But you had a very comfortable life.  

A: I had Œ I had Œ 
I had
 a very comfortable life in the sense that we had a large 
family an
d wehad many, manyfriends. We
 had 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ even a Jewish bank in this Œ 
in this town. There were out of the 6,000 people that lived in the t own, I think 50 

percent were Œ were Jewish. And it was Œ 
had qui
te a few synagogues. It was a Œ

and the town was always known Œ known as a 
Chabad
 town, 
Cha bad
, which was 
nowbeing known was asthe 
Lubavitch
. Inci dentally, in 1933 t he rabbi Œ the head 
rabbi from t he 
Lubavitch 
mo v emen
t 
came dow
n to our town and it was a big Œ 
a 
big event. I remember he came to t he train station and he was carri ed through 
because he had a
 Œ he was handicapped. And incidentally, m y parent s took me to 
hi m for a blessing and someti mes I sa y this bl essing ma ybe was t he one that saved 

me from all  these difficulties that I went through m y life. Now, I had a younger 

sister, and Œ two younger sisters. One was four years younger, the other one was 

eight years younger than myself.A
nd the cultural life was very Œ it  was 
a 
small ci ty 

but it was 
a 
v ery 
Œ 
v ery 
unique in the sense of the friendship and the Œ had many a 
large, large family, plus the fact we were also close to the border of 
Latvia
. And I 

had a Œ 
a 
aunt who married into 
Dvinsk
, which was about 50, 60 mil es, but it was 

already in 
L atvia
. So wehad
 also relatives that used to come in between 
Latvi a
 and 

Lithuania
. When I grew up, I went to 
a 
Œ to public school. My parents had said Œ 
decided to send me to 
Kovno
, which was the Œ which was the capital at that ti
me of 
Lithuania
.  

Q: Before we get to 
Kovno
, I just  Œ your Œ I Œ as I understand it, your family was 
quite religious?  

A: Yes, the y were not that fanatics but the y were Œ the y were Œ the Œ the whole Œ  

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

you see, the whole city, the Œ those small cities were very much religi ous. Peopl e 
were Œ there were exceptions who were not religious, most Œ 99 percent were 

religious, and everybody used to belong to the synagogue,  and there were no 
reformed or Œ or Œ or conservative. There was one type of synagogue. They were 
Orthodox synagogues at that ti me.  

Q: 
Didthe Jewish population mix muchwitht he
 Œ  

A: 
Very 
Œ 
v ery 
much in the sense that they were mostly storekeepers and we had 
attorne ys, and we had dentists, and we had a Œ like I mentioned, we had a bank. 

And the head of the bank was also, of course, a Jewish bank which Œ and the bank 

basically, 
mostly was
 also in a sense to help 
need
 Œ people in need and the y used to 
also partici pate in Œ in Œin charity and in helping people to establi sh themselves in 

new businesses.  

Q: Jewish and non-Jewish?  

A: Jewish and non-Jewish, right, yeah.  

Q: 
Oka y. Wha
t about political or Zionist organizations?  

A: There were Œ everybody was there a Zioni st, and many peopl e, incidentally have 

Œ at that ti me, it di dn™
t exist yet
, the State of Israel, but we had in Œ in quite a 
number of occasions, when Zionist leaders used to come down to our city to Œ to 
explain the necessity of having a Œ 
having our owncountry andpromote 
the Zionist

ideas.  
Q: 
Oka y. So you were beginni
ng to tell me about moving to Œ  

A: Yes, I Œ
I moved
 Œ actually, I Œ 
I 
Œ I didn't move. My family still stayed on in 
Rokiıkis
 and Œ but I was sent to 
Kovno
 and that ti me, at the age of 12 or 13, I was 
sent to my grandparent s who used to live in 
Kovno
. And m y parents felt ver
y 
comfortable, the fact that I™m going to be l iving together with m y grandparents and 
m y uncle. S
o the y used to live on Œ al most on the main st reet, was Œ which was call 
 
. That means, in translating, the 
Alley of Independence
. And I was 
right there on the corner of 
 and 
 
, and there used to li ve Œ 
m y 
Œ m y grandparents used to live and we were very comfortable. And the fact that 
the school they put me in was also a gymnasium, which was about five minutes 

walking distance from Œ from where the y used to live. And of course, I started 

going to the Œ to the school. The Œ the Œ the schooling system was extremely well 

and this Œ t his was the reason also t he y send me to 
Kovno
, because in the small 

cities the y didn't have Hebrew gymnasiums and this was a Hebrew gymnasium. 

And incidentally, t his gymnasium was on the name of 
Chase
 
because a benefactor 

by the name of 
Chase
 was the one that est abli shed Œ 
from 
United
 
States
, was t he 
one that established thi s gymnasium in Œ in the Œ in 
Kovno
, the capit al of 

Lithuania
. So I went t hrough the Œ the friend that had many friends. And we Œ we 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

didn't have too much ti me, leisure time, because the system Œ the education
al
 
system was extremely, extremely serious, and very disciplined. We used to have 
uniforms with a hat and Œ and a special outfit. And we basically start ed early in t he 
morning, and I used to come back home late and I had to make my homework, and 
was very, very little time to Œ to Œ for leisure. Of course, someti mes going to the 
movies, sometimes Œ incidentally, I also lived next store, right around the corner t o 

the opera, which I was very Œ you had a Œ 
Lithuania
 was a small country, but i t had 
a very
 cultural Œ the cultural life was there, very i ntense. And by havi ng the opera 
around us and especiall y m yself and also many of our friends were very much 

involved i n the opera. Of course, we didn't have the mone y and the resources to Œ to 
Œ to go and someti mes to the opera, but we always find a way to participate and t o 
enjoy the cultural life and especially the opera, the ballet. And it was a beautiful, 

beautiful opera. And this was also was in a compound of a Œ wit hin a park, a city 

park. I also remember t hat I used to read quite a lot. And there was, of course, radi o, 

all what we had. And it  was in the early stages. We didn't have, of course, TV or 

some other entertainment. So mostly our activi ties were basically around the 

community, around the synagogue, which was not too far also from us. 
Kovno
 was 
a city of about I would say hundred and Œ hun Œ hundred Œ over 100,000 people Œ 
out of about I would say maybe 150,000 people. Out of them, maybe one Œ

one-fourth, one-third was Œ were Œ were Jewish people.  
Q: You were in the main part of Œ of 
Kovno
? 
 

A: 
The mai n
 Œ yes, in t he main part, in the Œ i n the 
center
 Œ in the center, right. And 
remember that on Saturday, of course, the Œ the school Œ were no school and we 

used to wal k. We had this Œ 

, the street was composed of a median 

with benches and Œ and a place to Œ to walk and Œ and to enjoy. The climate Œ the 

cli mate 
was also very good in a cert ain way because of course 
we had
 
a 
Œ we were 
almost the same parallel as 
Montreal
, but their climate was a little bit  milder, in the 

sense we had very harsh winters and very beautiful summers. And we really 

enjoyed the Œ the surroundings. In winter, we used to go skating and Œ and had 
some
 Œ and with sleds, you know, had s Œ very war Œ it used to be also beautiful in 
the sense that we used to go out and Œ 
and had 
the winterti me, you know, with 
horses and sleds and it was a remarkable Œ it was a very i nteresting and Œ and 
v ery 

joyful life
, yeah
.  
Q: What di d the city look like?  

A: The city was a extremely, extremely clean city. And the buildings, we didn™t 

have any high-rise buil dings there. I think the tallest building was about four Œ 
four-stories high. Most of them were two stori es. Somewhere in the center of the 
city, of course, there were commerci al buildings and also apartment buil
dings. We

had also a number of movie theaters, and then we had a remnant from when Œ when 
Lithuania
 was occupied by 
Russia
, we had a place which was call ed the 

sabor
(ph). The 
sabor
(ph), that was a Œ 
a 
Œ like a church that was not functioning as 
a church, but it was like a Œ like a remnant from t he Œ from the tsarist ti mes and Œ 
and it was used, like, mostly as a museum. We had also few museums. It was also a 

mil itary museum,
 which was called a 
karo muziejus
. We had
 Œ also the topography 
was very beautiful because we had like, small mountains surrounding, and w
e had 

two rivers, the 
Neri s
 and the 
Nemunas
. And ofcou
rse, wintertime was very joyful, 

there were Œ when the y were frozen we used to enjoy the skating and going around, 

and Œ  
Q: What about Jewish l ife?  
A: Jewish life was very, very Œ for instance, I Œ 
Q: I'm sorry. I need you to start again because I was talki ng.  
A: Yeah. 
I belongedto different
 Œ not different Œ there were not too many 

organizations Œ Jewish 
organizations, mostly Zi
-Zionist. And al so at the same time, 
I belonged t o the international organization, which was the 
b
a di
n-b
adi
n
(ph)
, which 
were the boy scouts, which we enj oyed. We used to have outings and the outings 
were basically Œ we used to go out to the forest and then stay there over Œ stay over. 
And also we were taught different Œ different measures in ou-our rel-

relationship there, I mean, the Œ the Œ the essence of wha-what does it mean there, 
to be a boy scout in 
bad
in-b
a di
n
(ph)
. We also
 Œ I remember we were taught also Œ 
we used to wave wi th flags the 
Morse
 code, you know, with Œ 
by communicati ng
 
which is a Œ 
which ea
 Œ  with 
ea
ch other 
by 
Œ was the little flags li ke between two 
ships, you know. Also, I remember we were al so being educated and explained 

about the Œ about 
Palestine
 and about the activities that were at that  ti me in 

Palestine
, about the Œ t he influx of the amount  of Jewish people t o 
Palestine
. Also, 

about the 
Ottoman
 ti mes in 
Turkey
, which were also in some Œ or some years ago 
that Turke y, what Œ they had a very big influence on 
Palestine
 when the y had Œ 

they were under Turkish occupation, by the Ot tomans and 
[indeciphera ble]
.  We 
were ver y extremely well versed. And life went by and I used to go back to my Œ  in 

the summerti me, I used to go back to join m y Œ 
m y family to
 Rokiıki s
. I remember 
I used to take the train. It would take forever, and it was only about 200 miles. I 

don™t remember, kil ometers or miles, but 
[indecipherabl e]
. And then I used to join 

m y family and I was ve ry proud. People used to respect me very much for the fact 

that I am Œ 
I am 
Œ 
I am 
coming from my big cit y
, or 
Œ 
m y 
other friends were 
educated in our small city, most of them went to Lithuanian schools. And the 
relationship between Jews and Lithuanians was very, very cordial, you know, 
v ery 
nice, the y were very fri endly, and we had never had any Œ any big sense of 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

12
 
anti-Semiti sm. I mean, at least we didn™t Œ didn™t feel that. Someti mes, in sporadic 
cases, in Œ t here were certain Œ certain acts of hostility, but very, very rare. And 

going back and forth, and so we reached the ti me when I was Œ reached eight. The 
last year was the eight class
, you know,
 and this Œ this was the year when we Œ I 
was going to finish the gymnasium and, of course, after gymnasium, as Œ 
as you 

know, that a gymnasium i s like a Œ translated in terms of here, Ameri can terms, i t's 

like a partial
ly
 college Œ high school and college, whereby we had to take also 
logaritmai s
 and differentials and ma-many items that were many Œ such Œ 
many
 
subjects that were being taken in the Œ in t he Œ in Œ in wi Œ in the  university. 

[indecipherable]
 
My 
Œ I was Œ I took Lati n because we had Œ we were able to take 
some foreign languages. I Œ I Œ I t ook Œ Russian, I spoke because when I was born 

m y parents finished Russian schools before Lithuania was independent. So I Œ 
I 

spoke, when I Œ in the beginning I spoke Russian. And when I went t o Œ to school, 

and to cheder, I start speaking Yiddish, and then, of course, Hebrew and then, of 

course, Lithuanian. And then I took German i n Œ in school, I had to t ake. And then I 

took Latin because I Œ 
my
 Œ 
my
 i nterest was to become a doctor and m y parents 
wanted to send 
me toItal y beca
use t he curriculum in Œ in 
Lithuania
 was very 
small. We had a uni versity, not Œ not too big, and that was very difficult to get into 

the universi ty. So some friends of ours went to 
Italy
 and m y ai m was also to go t o 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

Italy
 
after finishing 
gymnasium. And of course, 1939, this was still before Œ two 
years before I finished gymnasium, the Œ the Russians Œ I mean, the turmoil in 
Europe started. The Russians have decided wit h the 
Ribbentrop 
pact, you know, to 
divide between 
Germany
 and 
Russia
. 
Russia
 
wasgoing totake over the 
Baltics
; 
Lithuania
, 
Latvia
, and 
Estonia
. And 
Germany
 was take part of 
Pol a
nd
, and Œ and 
of course, 
Czechosl ovakia
 and 
Austria
, so forth and so on. So it started already, 
the feeling we Œ we felt that there is somet hing Œ something happening, but we have 
never Œ 
we wer
e confident that our government is Œ which was a democratic 

co
untry wit h a president, a parliament, and wit h quite a lot of liberty and freedom. 
But in 1939, we have Œ we found out one da y t hat we are under the R ussian Œ the 
Russian Œ that the Russians have absorbed t he three 
Baltic
 states and we Œ we have 
heard Œ I mean, the Œ t hat like a da y or two days ahead of ti me that the Russian 
tanks are going to be coming int o 
Kovno
, to 
Lithuania
. Of course, t here was no 
resistance because com pared to 
Russia
, we had a small miniature army and there 

was no way that we were able to fight 
Russia
 at that ti me. And Œ and the Russians 
took Œ I remember when the y Œ when the y marched into 
Lithuania
. And righ
t awa y 
whenthe y marched in
 Œ you see, our gymnasi um was a Hebrew gym nasium. So 
when the Russians came in, the y changed their Œ right away the y eli minate Œ  

Q: I'm sorry. There™s airplane noises.

A: We didn™t give t hem permission. 
[brea k]
 
Q: How Œ how did, in 
Slobo dka
 especially, t hat was a very i mportant center of 
Jewish life, and I woul d like to Œ  
A: The Yeshivot. The biggest Yes
hiva, yeah, right
, yeah
.  
Q: Œ get a l ittle more detail of Œ 

A: Yeah, but can I cont inue? And then tha Œ that was Œ make it bri ef and then Œ  

Q: Sure.  

A: Right, so the Russians came and when t he y came in, the y changed the whole 

system. First of all, suddenly from a democracy,  we became a part of the Soviet 
Union, a republic. And right away they started changing the currenc y. They brought 
in many military personnel. The y start taki ng over and nat ionalize the businesses. 
The y Œ i
n my
 Œ in 
Roki ıkis
, m y parent
s were told that the Œ the house is too big, too 
luxury for Œ for Œ for a family, that  we have to take in some families. And the y put 

in some families in Œ in Œ in Œ in t he house. They Œ our business what Œ we had a 

factory of roofing paper, which was not too bi g so the y didn™t Œ t
hey didn™
t do 

anyt hing about that . But in 
Kaunas
 Œ i
n 
Kovno
, they start ed nationali zing the bi g 

businesses and the y start taking out those people who the y felt the y are not 
sympath
et
i c with t he Œ with the Œ with the Russian government and that the y had 
some 
Œ some kind of history that t he y were exploiting people. The y start taking 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

15
 
them out Œ taking t hem to 
Russi a
. I remember that, being still in school, I was gi ven 
the assignment to nationalize a large Œ a large wholesale food business, which all  

kinds of items there, and we had to take the inventory. And then, of course, the Œ 
the owners were placed temporarily to be t he managers and then t hey were kicked 
out basically,  from those businesses. So, in Œ i n Œ in 
Rokiıkis
, they al so start taking 
out those people who t hey considered that they are bourgeois. And fortunately my Œ 
m y parents
 
hadvery goodcontacts within the Lithuanian communi
ty. Father speak 
perfect Lithuanian, and as I mentioned, he was in the army, so they di dn™t touch 

hi m. But some of our relatives, the y took t hem out and the y send them to 
Russia
, 

and those people had very difficult time but they have Œ 
the y 
Œ they were fortunate 
in a certain wa y. And I'm going later to relate to you, that the y were fortunate bei ng 
Œ when the y were taken to Russi a, rather than sta y on. So going back to 
Kaunas
, 

we had Œ 
Ka una s
 was a, as I mentioned, not a very large city but we had som
e 
suburbs. One of them was 
Slobodka
, which wascalled 

 in Lithuanian. 
And this was a cent er of Jewish learning. There were Œ  

Q: Stand by please. 
[brea k]
 
A: P
eople usedto come
 Œ students used t o come from all over Œ all over the worl d 
to be educated in those yeshivots, which were in 
Slo bo dka
, which is Œ 
Slo bo dka
 
yeshiva was like a something Œ 
a special pl ace of
 Œ of  learning, which many, many 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

16
 
big scholars have come out from Œ  f rom t here Œ from this yeshiva. We had another 
yeshiva 
[indecipherable]
 
Ponevezh
, but 
Slobo dka
 was the Œ li ke the Œ the crown 
of the Œ of the Œ of the learning inst itutions. And most of the people, it  was a Œ most 
of 
Slobo dka
 was comprised of 
a 
Jewish population, middle lower class. But people 
were comfortable. There was not Œ nobody was hungry, especially, as I mentioned 
that 
Lithuania
 was an agricultural country. So there was never a shortage of meat  

and Œ and bread and Œ and some other product s like butter and milk, and that. So 

Slobo dka
 was very much considered as a Œ 
a 
very, very unique and very special 
place, not only in 
Lithuania
, like I ment ioned, but throughout the Œ 
throughout the 
western hemisphere.  
Q: Did you sp
end time in 
Slo bodka
 
as well? 
 
A: I spend very little ti me because I was more to Œ our gymnasi um was not a Œ not 
an extreme religious organization. We spoke Hebrew, we observed t he holida ys, but 

we were not  fanatics li ke I mentioned. 
We 
Œ  
Q: I have to ask you to try not to sa y "as I mentioned," because if this gets edited, 

we won™t know what the other part i s.  

A: I understand.  
Q: 
Thank you. 
 
A: Oka y, all right, okay. So we start livi ng under the Œ under the 
regi me of

suddenly became from m y free country, suddenl y became communist . A 
communistic system, socialistic system, t he y call that. And it was, in the beginning, 

we felt Œ we didn™t feel  too good about it but t hen we got used to it. Because 
especially at the age of 16 Œ 15, 16, 17, truthfully, we have not Œ we were still not Œ 
had the burden of carrying on a family and make a living and we Œ 
we 
were just 
sitting there and watchi ng the changes which happened very, very fast. We saw al so 

many fortifications have become Œ have been taken over by the Œ of course, the 

Russians have 
displa yed their force. We had a airport which was about Œ about 
seven or eight miles from Œ from our city. And of course, we didn™ t have a 
mil itary Œ military planes. I think we had one or two of them. That was considered a 
sizable amount for Œ for the Œ for the military i n 
Lithuania

Beginning Tape Two 
Q: You were telling me about, in 
Russia 
Œ  
A: Yeah, the Œ the l ife, the Jewish life in 
Kovno
, and in general 
Lithuania
, changed 
very drastically, and very dramatically, because we were used to belong la Œ to 
belong to our organizat ions, Zioni stic organizations. These became taboo. That i s a 

very offensive in the R ussian Œ in the Soviet syst em, to belong t o organizations 

which are not withi n their framework. They Œ right away, the y expelled all the 

teachers, all the Hebrew teachers, and suddenl y we became, rather than a Hebrew 

school, we became a Yiddish school. Yi ddish for them was like t he Œ 
mai n
 
language, truthfully, was Yiddish, but Hebrew for them, was Œ they had certain 
suspicions that Hebrew is a little bit too cl oser to the Œ the y consi dered those who 
spoke Hebrew like fascists, in a certain way. So, it was not easy t o get  transformed 

Œ to change sud-
suddenly, and 
Œ and Œ and especially for us kids, you know, it was 
Œ although everybody spoke Yiddish, but  the Œ the Œ the reason why I was sent to 

this gymnasium was not Œ because home we spoke Yiddi sh, was to learn, and to Œ 

to get acquainted with Œ with Hebrew, and not with Yiddish. B ut we had to obe y 

and do whatever the government has instructed us to do. Now Œ 
Q: Were any synagogues closed, or anything l ike that? 
A: The y were not cl osed. The y were not cl osed. The y still kept t hem open, but t he y

were under very tight 
scrutinity
(ph). And they watched very much who is going to 
the synagogue, and who is Œ and whether there is some counter-revol utionary Œ 
some kind of feeling or sentiments towards somet hing which is not in the Œ in the 
scope of the Œ of the Œ of the Soviet theory. Now, in meanti me, ti me was going on 
and the happenings in 
Euro pe
 were very t raumatic, and Œ and very drastic. 
Czechoslovakia
 
fell. We
 suddenly had an influx of checs Œ Czechoslovakian Œ  

Czechoslovakian re
fugees
. Some of them Œ many of them Jewish, who came Œ and 
they came actually to 
Rokiıkis
, not to 
Kaunas
. They were afraid to go to the large 
cities, cause they were afraid to be interned, and then sent back to Œ t o 

Czechoslovakia
. And t hey start tel ling u
s about 
Œ first of all, it was very hard for us 
to Œ to bring them in, because they Œ they were Œ they came in illegall y. But we 

provided them Œ first of all, we took them to a synagogue, and we made them 

comfortable there, and there, little by little, we spread them out to different family 

houses. And they start t elling us about the horrors, about what 
Hitler
 is doing to the 

Jewish population, and especially in 
Czechosl ovakia
. And most of those people 

who came, were very i ntelligent people, li ke one of them was a Œ I remember very 

vividly, one was a painter, and his paintings was fantastic. I remember even that he 
helped me t o paint some Œ I had to make the Œ to make a t hesis about certain Œ 
certain things in Œ i n school, and he helped me to, with a Œ with 
a 
Œ with the

paintings, whereby he 
Œ he was actually a perfect painter, you know, that. The other 
one, I remember the name, one was 
Foyer
(ph)
 Opataker
(ph), the other one was a 
businessman who lost his business, and he a Œ was able to escape, just by hi mself. 
He was not able even t o bring his family. They Œ  then we had also influx from Œ 
from Polish refugees, who came Œ 
especially Polish mi litarypeople, whointerned 

themselves. But this Œ 
t h ey 
Œ the y came in actually legally Œ not 
I 
Œ 
t h ey 
Œ 
I mean 
they Œ they crossed the border, and then they surrendered. So, of course their arms 
were taken awa y, and Œ and the y were placed in a Œ in Œ I remember i n a Œ in the 

center of the city, that was in 
Rokiıkis
. And I remember seeing them with their Œ 

where the y t ook Œ care more on Œ the y were more concerned about their boots and 
their uniforms than about some ot her Œ ot her t hings, you know. 
Q: Excuse me, I thi  Œ you™re hearing that moving around i n the kitchen? 
[brea k]
 
A: So this Œ this affected us, as youngsters, affected us very much, and Œ and we 

started listening to their stories, and Œ and then the horror stories that  were Œ about 

the killings, about the rapes, about the robberies, about the Œ and Œ and we just Œ I 

remember I j ust was sit ting, like I™m sitti ng now in the armchair, and listening to 

what the y had to sa y. B ut of course, after I list en to their stories, I went Œ I had my 
food, and I had m y Œ my room, and my bed, and the next day I got involved again in 
m y daily duties. So, it affected us, but what we have not Œ we Œ we s Œ we shoul d Œ

looking in retrospect, we should have been a little bit more concerned, and more 
careful, and Œ which, we didn™t do that, and Œ  

Q: You didn™t thi nk thi s was going Œ 
A: We didn™t Œ we didn™t think t hat this was going to expand. We felt that we are 
now very well protected under the Soviet regi me, which Soviet 
Russia
 was 
considered Œ I Œ a st ronghold, you know, and t he Œ in Œ in 
Europe
, and we felt that 
we™re Œ we™re in the safe side. In the meanti me, in Œ in our house was also 
we were 

Œ we were compelled t o take in some bor Œ some tenants, and one of them was a Œ 
a 

Œ was a Russian pilot. There was one pilot, and then they joined t he other one. And 

we had to give up one of the rooms, and t he y Œ and the y were there together wit h 
us. And I finished the gymnasium, we got  ready to go back home, but for some 
reason, the certificates of completi on were not  made available. So I felt rather than 

to go back home, and I Œ I was very proud that I finish without any Œ 
any problems 
Œ I was not  one of the best teacher Œ student s, but I Œ I did my homework, and I Œ I 

never failed from one year to the ot her one. So I was waiting for to get a certificate 

in order to be able to come home, and to bring the sa Œ 
sa y I
-I finished, and 
graduated, and I™m ready to go to university. So this was in the middle of June. And 
they told me that t he certificates are going to be finished by June Œ by the later part 
of June, and I felt I™m going to stay for a few more da ys. You know, school has

finished. The summer was there, and it was ni ce, and we got a little bit more used to 
the Œ to the Œ to our new system, and came June 21
st
, nighttime, and suddenly we 
had a Œ we heard a Œ some movement in the Œ in the room, from t he t wo pilots t hat 
we had. And they suddenly, middle of the night, they run out, without saying 
anyt hing. They disappeared. And a little while later we heard bombings, we heard 

planes. And we put  on the radio, and this was the invasion of the second Œ actually 

the Œ the Nazi part of the second World War started. Whereby that 
H itler
 didn™t 
announce, w
ithout announcing, he just Œ he starts Œ start the invasion. And he 

actually deceived anybody, because there were no massed troops on t he borders t hat 

time. He just tried t o get this war started, and Œ and Œ 
and startedwar by surprise. 
And it was really a surprise, because no Œ nobody Œ nobody was Œ was ready for 
that. Everybody was living with the dreams that the y had this 
Ri bbentrop
 pact, it 
was 
Molotov
, and Œ and that both parts were satisfied that there is no Œ we Œ we 

leaned more to the fact that we thought that he is going to Œ if he is going to attack, 

he is going to go against 
England
, rather than Œ than Œ it  was a Œ 
a 
incredible 
surprise. 
So,right away it 
Œ I remember m y house, we Œ we Œ we didn™t 
know what 
to do. We had also a ot her tenant, which I didn™t mention before, that  was Œ 
yeah? 
What 
Œ what Œ 

Q: 
[indeci pherable]
 which I didn™t menti on Œ

A: Oka y, fine, eli minate it. We had a other t enant that was in the Œ 
in the 
Œ worked 
in the transportation. And he told us right  away t hat there is a truck going to be 
available if we want Œ we want to go, but we were so confused, and everybody Œ we 
saw masses of soldiers, Russian soldiers running from one place to the other one. 
The y bombed Œ 
basical ly, wh
en the y started bombing, the y bombed t he airport, and 

then certain military objectives. And the Œ the whole city became a Œ 
a 
Œ a turmoi l. 
And we also heard about, through the radi o, they start announcing that 
Germany
 
has attacked the 
Soviet Union
, and wir Œ that Œ the Lithuanians are Œ this was st ill 
with the Russians there, that the Li thuanians are very much in Œ i n Œ i n Œ in Œ in 

favor of Œ of reading and Œ and receiving the Œ the victorious Œ t he victorious 
German troops. When I Œ I wanted to reach m y house, because I Œ I felt to Œ to unite 
m yself with the family. And I start running on the Œ in the highway, with m y 

bic ycle. I got my bicycle, and Œ and when I came to a certain point , I saw people 

coming towards us and said, return, because there is atrocit ies on t he highway. They 

Œ they fly low, the German airplanes, and t hey Œ  and the y just kill everybody that is 

on there, on the highways. From t ime to t ime you have to run off and Œ and throw 

yourself on Œ on the ground, because the Œ the massacres are just i ncredible, 
especially i n Œ because, you see the civilians, and the Œ and the Œ 
t he Russians were 
also Œ the y were mi xed. They were running together. Many Russian trucks, the y Œ

right away t he y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ they start abandoning their military supplies, an
d military 
barracks, and Œ and they Œ  they just try to move eastward, you know, towards Œ 
towards 
Russia
. And this was so dramatic, and we Œ we Œ 
wedidn™t know. We had 
some relati ves on t he Œ we had 
a 
Œ that was called a Œ the 
klininbar
(ph), that™s the Œ 
the green Œ the Green Mountain. That was a Œ a place wit hin Œ withi n 
Kovno
 where 
we had some relatives who Œ who Œ from m y aunt™s part, who li ved t here. We felt 

ma ybe to go to them, there in that place ma ybe would be safer. So we went up 

there, and then we came back to our Œ to our apartment, feel the safest place is to 

stay in the apart ment. Killings st arted, and especially Lit huanians, where the y were 

very bo Œ very much against Œ against the Soviets. They hated the Soviets, you 
know, from the beginning. 
So  
Œ and the y considered that there are some Jewish 
people were in the communists, and Œ and they Œ  right awa y the y wanted to take 

vengeance, you know, and what the y did i s, they right awa y start killi ng people, 

start torturing them, start Œ there was a s Œ a special Œ a special torture chamber, 

which was made to a Œ to a torture chamber, which was made in 
a 
Œ one of their gas 
stations. The y brought in about 20 people, and they put hoses in their mouth, and 

they Œ and t he y start water pressuri ng. And they just killed them with the Œ with 
that. I mean, there were so Œ such 
atrocity that beyond 
Œ beyond description. And 
the Germans were not i n yet. The ger Œ Germans were still Œ the y Œ 
they 
Œ you see, 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

the Germans, they had their tactics of the surrounding in a ring, and then closing up 
in the ring, an-and Œ and coming t o the Œ t o the Œ to the focal point where the y were 

going to occupy. The Œ for the Russians i t was a incredible shock what happened, 
and the y Œ t he y were really not prepared and not ready for the oncoming victorious 
German troops. There were also announcements in the radio two days later, where it 

said that Œ it was i n Lithuanian, in Russian, and in German, what said that Œ but 

basically hi ghlight ing i n Lithuanian. The victorious German troops are coming, are 

close to 
Kovno
, they are going to enter 
Kovno
 in Œ in the next hours, and we have 
noticed that  some snipers, and some communists, and some Jews have Œ 
are 

resisting, and shooting against them. So we want to mention that  for each German 
soldier that is going to be killed Œ that™s going to be killed Œ hundred Jews or 
communists are going t o be taken and shot , wi thout Œ without any Œ 
any question. 

And this was constantl y, and Œ and constantly in the radio. So we Œ we felt already, 

we knew what Œ what Œ what™s coming and Œ and we didn™t realize that we felt, 

ma ybe after 
Kovno
 is going to be taken over by the Germans, maybe the y are going 
to establish their Œ their rules, and t he y are going to be more human t han Œ than t he 

Lithuanians, but this was not the case, and they occupied 
Kovno
. Then suddenly, 
every da y the y used to make Œ 
promulgate a 
Œ a new decree. One decree, the first 
one was that all Jews have to bring into the 
komma ndantur
 any arms, if they had 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

26
 
any 
Œ 
any 
Œ any radios. Any watches. Anything, right away. Then there came a 
second decree, that t he Jews cannot walk on the sidewalk, the y have to walk on the 
Œ on the Œ on the street side. Third decree was that you have to give up all your Œ all 
Œ all the val uables. If you have some jewel ry, som
e 
Œ some Œ any kind, any type of 
jewelry, stamps Œ I had a big collection of stamps, m yself. I had to take m y stamps 

and take it over to t he Œ to the 
kommandantur
. And that was considered Œ 

Q: How would they know that you had it? 

A: You know, the Œ the Œ the remedy, and t he y Œ the y Œ what Œ what t hey s Œ the y 

stressed is, if by any chance we spot check, and we found that after this Œ they give 

you like 24 hours, or 48 hours to return all the Œ all the valuables. If they spot 
check, and t he y find somebody that has somet hing what they Œ what t he decree was 
about, the y would take hi m out and shoot hi m right awa y. So no Œ nobody had Œ I 

think most of the people didn™t want to Œ well, want to risk Œ of course, we risked, 

and Œ and it  was a Œ  it was like taking your Œ your life in your hands. But in the 
beginning, you 
Œ you didn™t know what Œ what it Œ 
what it 
Œ to do, or not to do, 
because we 
Œ now, the last decree was that all Jews have Œ that was al ready a month 
later, in August, that all  Jews have to come, and the y™re making a ghetto, surr-
surrounded by barbed wire, and this ghetto, all the Jews have to trans-transport 
themselves, for their own means, get us a horse and buggy, and Œ and travel to t he

ghetto, which is in 
 
, i n 
Slobo dka
. This is where the y decided, because 
they were originally a Jewish population, and those Lithuanians who were living 
there, have t o give up their houses, and the y were going to be reset tled in some 
other houses, which were left by Œ 
by 
Œ 
by the Jews.I mean,that was like 
quid pro 
quo Œ pro quo, you know, the y exchange. So right awa y we started looking for a Œ 
for a place, and there was also on first come, first move in basis. But of course, 

there were certain Œ they give you certain paramet ers, whereby that if you take Œ i
f 

you can™t work out wit h a Lithuanian some ki nd of deal, whereby you can give him 

your house, and gi ve hi m some nice furniture, and on top of that give hi m 

something extra, what Œ and we were fortunat e to find a Œ a house in 
Linkuvos 
, I thi nk it was, number 45, if I™m not mistaken. And we found a house, but the 

house was Œ it was a house, but in the house you had to Œ 
you 
Œ you were able just 
only Œ only about four or five people to occupy only one room. And t he rest of the 

rooms were distributed to 
some 
Œ some other people. 

Q: Who was in your Œ who was sta ying with you? 

A: With us was staying a Œ m y uncle, m y aunt Œ 

Q: I™m sorry. I want you to start t hat sentence, I was living with m y Œ  
A: I was Œ the house that we were moved in, in 
Slo bo dka
 in t he ghet to was my 
uncle; m y aunt; my cousin, who was two years old at that ti me Œ or one and a half

year; m y grandmot her. That was in Œ in one Œ i n one room. Then i n the other rooms 
was a Œ a relative, a brother of my aunt, with his wife, with a litt le baby. In the other 

rooms were two ladies, a older lady, a younger name Œ by the name of 
Londonski
(ph), and their daughter. So we were like three families, i n a very litt le 
tiny-
miney
 
house, you know.
 We had a small yard, we had Œ the facil ities were not 
in the house, they were outside. I had some water, and we had some certain things 

that we brought along with us, except for valuables. And this, when we™re Œ when 

they closed the ghet to Œ that was i n the beginning Œ the right wa y, when the y closed 

the ghetto, they wanted to show t heir Œ their Œ that they Œ they mean business, so 
what the y t ook is one Œ one guy that apparentl y t he y claimed that he hadn't 
complied with the Œ with the rules, the y took him out and the y publicl y hanged him. 

And he was hanging for about a week. So everybody in t he center of the Œ of the 

ghetto in Œ  everybody t hat came by should have si Œ looked at Œ his name was 

Mac
(ph), and I think Œ I Œ I™m sure that Œ I™m not I™m sure, but I know that 
Kalish
(ph) has a picture from that, which she t ook with this candid camera.  

Q: So you walked by t his? 

A: We had to walk by Œ by this man hanging for about a week. Week™s a long t i me 
now. When we came into the ghett o, right away t he y establish Œ t he y start again 
with all ki nd of tricks, playing with us. The first Œ the first decree was that the y

need 500 educated i ntel Œ intelligentsia Œ intel ligent people, who finished the 
gymnasium, and t he y need them for a very special task. The y need them right awa y, 

and you have to Œ you have to come in by cert ain hour, in a certain pl ace in the 
center of the ghetto. So, everybody was Œ

 noise. I do want to hear t he story, but airplanes. Do you want Œ 
[brea k]
 I™m hearing a l ot of noise, you™re not hearing Œ it™s not bad? Okay.  
A: So, the y came out with a new decree, and t his was to get five Œ they needed 500 

Œ 

Q: Can you start t hat and say, the Germans came up with Œ 

A: The Germans Œ the Germans, soon the y closed the ghet to Œ 
[bells] [break]
 Œ 
should have thought of that, it™s right after this Œ after the decree. The Germans 
have promulgated a decree, whereby that the y need 500 immediat ely, for a very 

special task, 500 educated intelligentsia peopl e who were Œ had certain level of 

education. In order t o be able to comply wi th t his Œ with this special requirement. 

And everybody was some kind, you know, just came into the ghet to, and Œ 
and we 

were short on food, and then the y also promised that the y are going t o be rewarded, 

very much re Œ very properly rewarded wit h Œ with food that Œ nobody Œ  nobody 
spoke about mone y. Mone y was irrelevant at t hat time. The Œ the basi c thing was 
food, food and food, you know. So everybody was rushing. My uncle Œ m y aunt™s

brother told me that he would like to Œ he would like to go, and he had just to Œ he 
was in process of shaving or something, t hat I should wai t for him few minutes. I 

was not too familiar with the ghett o yet, because it was split up i n such a wa y, and I 
was never t hat Œ in that  section of the city, maybe once or twice in my lifeti me, 
because I had also a Œ 
a 
football place, where m y 
Maccabi
(ph) used to play there, 
in 
Slo bodka
, and m y uncle Œ one of m y uncles was a very, very good football 
player, so I Œ somet imes, you know, I was Œ but this was a new situat ion. So, I 

didn™t know, and we were a little bit nervous, in the sense we wanted to be there on 

time. We di dn™t have Œ we didn™t have watches, you know, we had to l ook at the 

sun, and to approxi matel y make sure that we™re in the right ti me. We Œ we start 
going, looking for a Œ for a place where the y Œ  where we were supposed to get, and 
we got there like 10 mi nutes late. There were already 506 people, were already up 

this Œ fulfill this assignment, this projected amount of people, and the Œ the 

Germans were satisfied, and you know, Germans are very meticulous and punctual. 

And the y said, we have already the amount, and you go back, we don™t need you 

any more. So we were a little disappointed, you know, we came back. In meantime, 

what happened within t he Œ in the ti me that the Jews start moving to the ghetto, the
y 
were marry 
Œ 
manyatrocities committed byLithuanians. I mean, they were 
Œ they 
were Œ 
the y were 
Œ j ust became so barbaric, and without any Œ 
any 
Œ 
any reason,

you know. The y Œ they start killing, raping, an-and taking awa y all  ki nd of Œ all 
kind of items that belonged to Œ to the Jewish people, you know, when they Œ when 

Œ every ti me we moved, when we moved t o the Œ to the Green Mountain, we were 
going to m y aunt™s brother™s house. He had there a little farm, and we felt we™re 
going to go over t here, and we™re going to be able to have some food, because he 

had Œ the farm still belonged to hi m. So, when we went there, there were Œ 

nighttime came in, and a group of like three or four people with their guns, and they 

started taki ng awa y everything, whatever 
we 
Œ  and Œ and m y uncl e stood up for 

them, so the y hit hi m with their Œ with thei r Œ with their rifle butt, you know. 

Q: Sorry to keep breaking up the story, but Œ 
[brea k]
 
A: So we felt very, very defenseless, because there were no Œ nobody to protect 

anyb
od y. I mean, it was a completely chaos and everyone did Œ whoever had a gun 
Œ I mean, he was the one that Œ similar to what™s happened now i n 
H aiti
. Whoever 

had a gun, he was Œ he was able to do what Œ what Œ what he wished, you know. 

There were no Œ no Œ absolutely Œ the Germans have not taken over yet. They Œ 

they were in, but the y mind their own business, and the y let Lithuani ans to enjoy 

themselves, doing what  the y did. And it was Œ was terrible things they have done. 
The y have taken peopl e to their Œ to their Œ to Œ to a prison. And there was also a 
teacher of m y Œ I remember 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Goldman
(ph), a famil iar name. He

was our English teacher. He was hi mself from 
South Africa
. And he was a 
compulsive smoker, so the Œ the y wouldn™t give hi m any Œ anything t o smoke, so he 

used to get the small ration of Œ of bread, he used to exchange that  for Œ for 
cigarettes. And he final ly succumbed, he died, you know, because he Œ he just Œ his 
body wouldn™t Œ wouldn™t resist it . But beside the beatings, and the Œ and the Œ and 
the Œ the Œ the terror that the y Œ the y have i mplanted hi m in was Œ it was just 
terrible. It was a case which Œ I have to describe that Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ a Russian tank failed 

to Œ when they were Œ by escaping, the y Œ 
they just 
Œ he was right next to the Œ next 
to the river, the 
Nemunas
. For some reason, I mean, he emerged in Œ in water, and 

got stuck t here. They caught about 20 people, the y put them like Œ like Œ like 
horses, you know, to pull out a t Œ how can 20 people pul l out a tank, which is who 
knows how many tons is the weight of the tank, and the y just hit Œ hi t the people, hit 

the people, til 
mo
- most  of them were blooded, and Œ and Œ and were Œ were fainted, 
you know, in the Œ that Œ that was the Œ that was the situation. So one Œ in a certai n 

way, when we came int o the ghett o, we felt a little bit safer in our surrounding. We 

knew that Œ  that there are going to be Œ we Œ we predicted, we anticipated some 

atrocities, but Œ but  at l east the y were going to be in a Œ in a Œ in a Œ i n a certain Œ in 
a certain Œ done in a certain wa y. We with Œ with some kind of order, no-not wit h Œ 
not Œ not j ust as sporadic, you know. So Œ

Q: What about Œ what about the Œ some of the massacres outside of the city, in the 
very beginning? 

A: No, those people who were running, and who came, who try to come back, I 
mean there™s Œ most of them were Œ were just killed in the Œ on the highways, and 
they Œ 
the y would just comeintoahouse, they would 
Œ 
people who stilldidn™t  
come toget her. Because the process to come into the ghetto was like a 30 day 

process. So the y used to assault them, and then take away all their Œ whatever their 

Œ their Œ whatever t he y had, their packages, their suitcases, their valises, and Œ and 

they used t o, in many cases 
people would killthem,
 in order just not to take them, 

because the y used t o take them out and Œ and shoot them in the outside, so Œ  
Q: But weren™t there some Œ  
A: There were also Œ 

Q: Œ systematic Œ 

A: There were systematic. There were also a Œ they were called the
 ıauliai
. Th
at  

was a Lithuanian organization which are like Œ they were called like Œ they™re Œ 

they™re Œ 
the y were made

from 
Œ they were not Œ 
not army people, but it was like organization who used t he uniform of sha Œ 
ıauliai
 
was like the Œ like the Œ the y were called li ke the riflemen. And then these people 
would exert incredi ble, incredible hatred, and Œ and hate, 
an
-and t he y would come

out and Œ and do al l kind of atrocities, you know. And the y Œ they were able to do 
anyt hing t he y wanted, because the Œ because the Germans would let them do that, 

because the y felt that  they are, in a certain way, t hat the y are pleasing them, and 
they Œ the y were going to have them on their side when Œ when Œ when the y need it. 
And this was actual ly a fact, because most of the Œ of the massacres were done by th 

Œ by the Lithuanians under Œ under the supervi sion Œ certain supervisi on of the 

Germans.

Q: Did you Œ and t he ot her thing is, anythi ng that you sort of firsthand saw, that™s 
always valuable. 
A: I Œ I saw the Œ because I was almost trapped in this Œ when Œ  when the y Œ what 
had happened with the tank, you know? I saw that, it was in my vicini ty. And then 

the Œ m y uncle was very smart, he actually took the Œ I mean, he t ook the position to 
sit in-inside the apartment, then we have to 
[indecipherable]
 to sit inside. And 
fortunatel y, we were li ving in a Œ in a place where were Œ 
therewere not many 

Jewish people there. And the Œ the Œ the Œ 
the manag
er of this place, because it was 

mostly offices, and the manager of the place was very, very nice Lithuanian guy, 
you know, exceptional. And he would not Œ they came, I mean, a few occasions, to 
ask him whether there™s some Jews living there, and he would sa y that, not to his 

knowledge, you know. I mean, he Œ he actuall y saved us, you know. It wouldn™t be 

for him, we would be 
[i ndeciphera ble]
. But the first days, I mean, it was a 
complete 
[i ndecipherable]
. I mean, it™s Œ the Œ we Œ I had m yself, have Œ have seen 
people beaten and Œ and Œ and hurt, and especially what happened in 

 with 
this Œ with this horses, you know. This was a Œ we Œ 
we have a 
Œ we Œ 
we have seen 
not exactly what happened there, but we have seen the Œ well, the way t he y took in 
the people, and Œ 
and we 
Œ we know for a fact, I mean, I Œ there were also pictures

about it. But they Œ 
they have 
Œ there were a few thousand people who were Œ who 
were documented as Œ as killed in the first Œ i n the first few days. And these were 
people that Œ that the y s Œ not only the y run to the highwa y, but peopl e who were 
just systematically taken out from their houses. They went  with t heir l ist, apparent ly 
they had a list of Œ of addresses, would take them out and then just Œ not Œ it Œ it wa 

Œ shooting was not th-the Œ the great part, but Œ but to torture, all kind of ways of 

torturing, you know, like chopping off a arm, a-and especially also with children. 

That was terrible, and all, but what they have done with Œ with children, like 

smashing t hem against the wall, or Œ and most of the time they were drunk, you 

know. Because for one thing is the Lithuanians knew Œ I mean, the y were very 
educated in Œ in dri nking. The y used to mad
e 
Œ make a lot of homemake Œ 
homemade vodka. It was called 
samagonda
(ph), it was made from potatoes. And 
this was, li ke in the ti mes of prohibition, you know, th-this Œ this was Œ you know, 

due to the fact of the cl imate, that we have a cold climate, there are very many, 

many drunks on the Œ on the streets. There were alwa ys many drunks, and Œ and Œ 

and this drinking didn™t  help the si tuation i n the beginning, because they had that 

available, the y Œ they t ook over some places where there were all ki nds of Œ of 
liquor, an-and Œ and wi ne, and Œ and the y Œ they would empty this out, and th Œ th-
this Œ this was also somet hing that the y had i n common with the Russians, who 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

were also very good in that, you know, in drinking. So th-that Œ they had the first Œ 
the first few days there were numerous amount s of Œ of people that were Œ the y 

were counted possi bly in the couple thousands of them, yeah. 
Q: How did t
h ey 
Œ was there a way that they selected Œ I mean, did they 
[indecipherable]
 
A: The y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ 
t he y had 
Œ the y had list s. They Œ they came out Œ apparently 
somebody submit ted them, the y had lists with addresses, and the y Œ and beside t hat, 
even they didn™t have a list, the y used to come in, smash in, break int o the door, and 

say 
Œ and they would right awa y spot who is who. And there was something else. 
Something else I have to mention is that ri ght after Œ after we were Œ after the 
Germans came in, t he y came 
about 15 
Œ t wo weeks afterwards, we had to start 
using the yellow stars. This was a Œ first, in the beginning on the front, and then we 
had to use t hem front and back. And they cannot be clipped in, they had to be sewn 

in, cause cli pped in they cl ai m that you can take it off, and so Œ so they, right awa y 
they knew how to identify. And there was also 
a 
very strict  order, those people who 

wouldn™t wear a Œ 
a 
Œ a Jewish star, the y would not ask any more questions. That 
would be the Œ 
the end of 
Œ of those Œ this person that would not carry the Œ the star. 
So  
Œ 

Q: How did you feel about wearing that?

A: About?  
Q: How did you feel about wearing the star? 

A: First, in the beginni ng I felt like I Œ like I Œ I have a chip on my shoulder, you 
know. But  then you Œ 
yo
u get used, you know, we™re in Œ we™re Œ we™re creatures of 
Œ of Œ of Œ of nature, of Œ of getting Œ getti ng used to things, you know, after Œ there 
is 
[indecipherable]
 sayi ng, I mean, that you sleep over one night wit h a problem, 
and the next morni ng, I mean, there Œ there™s no problem, th-th-the Œ 
your 
Œ th-then 
you have already a other problem, which Œ which comes across, you know, but  so Œ 

and that™s true, you know, it™s Œ i n a certain way we Œ there was also a question why 

Œ why we didn™t resist. There 
were some 
Œ some cases of resistance. There was a 
case of a school mate of mi ne, his name was 
Di scant
(ph), that he dressed hi mself as 
a 
Œ as a German officer, and Œ 
[interrupti on
,
 
brea k] 
He Œ he Œ there were formed, 
small groups of resistance, really in Œ were in the forming. The y were a little older 

than m yself,they were alittle more mature.Thosewho 
Œ who started Œ who started 

organizing. And there was a friend of mine, al ready 
a 
friend that we used to Œ 
he 

used to come to m y house, and we used to Œ 
to
 not only go to school together, but to 
have some and certain t hings in common, you know. So he Œ he was dressed as a Œ 
dressed a German officer, and the y Œ they were supposed to escape to the forest, 
you know, to pro at Œ I mean, to institute t heir resistance. And apparently the guy,

the chauffeur that™s supposed to take them, bet rayed them. And then Œ and that was 
already not the Lithuanians, but the Germans caught them, and they took them to 

the Gestapo and they shot them, all of the, you know, there were l ike 14 people and 
one of Œ he was one of those. So t here were start Œ and the questi on is, why didn™t 
you have resistance. Because the Russian army that was there, and they had their Œ 

their Œ their arms, and t hey were not resisti ng, because the y saw the handwriting on 

the wall, they saw what actually happened, t hey saw the might. And when the Œ I 

remember the da y the Germans came in, and I looked through t he wi ndow. My 

uncle used t o pull me back, I shoul dn™t look through the window, because an-
any 

momen
t, I mean, somebody can shot Œ shoot you, you know. Tha Œ when the y came 
in, and the y Œ and they paraded in the street, they came in clean, wit h their boots 

shining, you could Œ li ke mirrors, you know, and with loudspeakers. Ahead of them 

were Lithuanians who were pronouncing that the victorious German arm y is 

coming in, that the y Œ t his is only a Œ are going to be established here. But the army 

is going to move on, and Œ and finish with the Œ with the Œ with t he Soviets, and it™s 

a matter only of a short  ti me. The y expect to do that within the summer. That was Œ 

that was June. So t he y figured, June, July, August, September, October gets ready. 
So the y Œ 
t h e y 
thought their
 Œ they were projecting to occupy the 
Soviet Union
 
about four or four mont hs, you know, which they Œ 
Napoleon 
was not able to do

that also, you know. He had the same Œ the same pattern. But resi sting, I Œ it Œ it Œ it 
was Œ everybody was on the shock, you know. And Œ and normal ly, we people were 

not ready for Œ for resisting. We have never had an-anything, any training in Œ in Œ 
in Œ in arms. When I know that later on, I™m going to tell  you that Œ which I hi Œ 
will tell you now, that I used to, in many cases I used to take off my Œ m y stars, and 

Œ and then used to go out and I was blondi sh, I didn™t look too much as Œ well, non-

Jewish, and I used to go out and Œ and trade certain things in order to get Œ to get 

some food, because their f Œ the food situation became very critical
, very critical. 

As soon t he y took us into the ghett o, the y Œ they started in Œ they started taking 

brigades, the y were cal led brigades. When a brigadier creates Œ they i nstituted a Œ 
a 
police, a Jewish police was in the ghetto, and t hen the y instituted also the Œ a Jewish 
council. So, first of all the y were Œ had to repair to fix the airports. So everybody 

was compelled to go out in the morning, five o™clock in t he morning had to be in the 

reunion place, and t hen the y used t o come and Œ with guards, and Œ and walk to the 

Œ to the airport. So I remember they used t o give us 200 grams of bread, and I used 

to put it in the pocket, an-and by t he time I came to the Œ to the airport, and when 

they used t o give us some soup, which was made of water, and wel l, with some Œ 
some vegetables, some kind of this 
[indeciphera ble]
 veget ables, you know. And 
they used t o boil t hat, and by that time I di dn™t have really bread, because walking, I

Œ I used to chew off on the portion of bread. So the situation of Œ the food situation 
became very 
Œ the Œ the Œ the durat ion was very, very bigger. And we Œ we had t o 
trade someti mes, certain objects with the Œ wit h Lithuanians. So, in the beginning, 
they used t o let the Œ we were able to do that, but there were some Œ some peopl e 
who didn™t have a heart , from the Lithuanian side, you know. For instance, used to 
trade a Œ 
a 
Œ a suit for a Œ for a kilo of butter. So after you Œ you have to do that fast, 
you know, because they Œ  you had to do that when the guard was with his back to Œ 
to you, youknow.
 So, i n the desperation you found out someti mes that instead of 
butter, what  you had is a big stone, on that  Œ I mean, with Œ 
with a 
Œ with a little bit 
Œ with a lit tle bit of but ter on Œ on the sides, you know. And it was disaster, and you 
Œ you were unable to do anything, you know, that™s Œ those people who were free 
had all the rights. We were Œ we Œ we lost 
[indecipherable]
 lost, we were 
inhunamen
 Œ 
I mean, not 
Œ not considered human. The y Œ although t hey didn™t 
tattoo us with Œ with Œ on the begi nning 
[indeciphera ble]
 afterwards in Œ when 
they took t o the concentration camp. So life was Œ was terrible, especially in the 

beginning, it 
Œ it-i t was very hard t o Œ to get the Œ get used to and accommodate it, 
but Œ but t here was no Œ no choice. You had t o Œ you had to do what you were told 
to do, you know, i t™s Œ 
Q: Was the move t o the ghetto itself chaotic, or was it Œ how was it organized Œ

A: No, it was Œ 
it wasvery organized.
 
Q: You s Œ then you say, t he move to the ghett o was very organized. 
A: Was very Œ  
Q:No. We need 
Œ 
A: Œ 
very much 
Œ 
t he move 
Œ the move to the ghetto was very organi zed. Was very 
organized in the sense that you would hardly see fights between people that, no I 
want this house, I want that house. There were certain Œ that was cert ain way 

organized that you were able Œ of course, you had to get yourself a Œ somebody Œ 
a 

horseman with a buggy and Œ and be able t o Œ to carry over, and couple pieces of 
furniture, and most ly the Œ the Œ your personal belongings. But it  was in a certain 
way 
Œ it was in cert ain way organized
, because by 
Œ 
by 
t he peopl e themselves. You 
know, it™s not Œ we di Œ we didn™t  have Œ we had a certain leadershi p which was 
already instituted, but i t was not a Œ 
a 
Œ a full time leadership, it was j ust Œ the y 

came with t he least, and the y told you look, you have to go here, here, here, and you 

have to do t his and this and it, and wa Œ you know, the people were very much 

organized, and very much respectful, you know, we™re Œ we™re not  Œ we were not 

strict people, you know, it was mostly people who were Œ who had a certain 
background, and you hardly were able to find somebody that was not educated, that 
was not abl e to read or write. This was Œ you take from the Lithuanians, you had 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

like 50 percent for the people were illiterate, you know, especially those who lived 
on the farms, the y Œ they Œ  they didn™t know how to read or write. They used to put 

a cross for Œ when t he y had to sign somet hing, you know. And t his was the sad part, 
you know, because people who are not literate, and who drink a l ot and who don™t 
have 
any 
Œ 
any 
Œ 
any 
Œ  
any
 
fee
ling towards Œ t owards 
[indecipherabl e]
 humans, 
they Œ 
the y become 
Œ 
t hey become very 
Œ t hey become like ani mals, you know, and 
Œ and this i s what Œ what happened there, and I really regret to sa y that, that there 

were, of course cases whereby they harbored Jews, they helped to escape, and 

there™s Œ but that was sporadic, I mean, that  was like a one percent, or something, 

that Œ 
that have 
Œ were human. And this was al so most people who were a little bit  
better educated, and who actually knew the facts, and Œ and who Œ who were able to 

Œ to analyze, and Œ and Œ and realize that savi ng somebody in t hese critical ti mes, 

although t he y expose their lives, because any Œ anybody that saved a Jew was like Œ 

oh, it Œ would be Œ would be shot  the same way, like the Œ those people that they 

saved. 

Q: Basically, as soon as the Germans occupied 
Kovno
, life, as you all knew it, 

stopped. I mean, that Œ

A: No, no. There were no schools there. B ut amazingly Œ  
amaz
ingly that in the 
ghetto, we were like 30 some thousand people, were pushed into t his couple square 
kilometers in very i nhuman condit ions. But th-the Œ the ghetto life right awa y Œ I 
mean, we ri ght away organized ourselves. We had like Œ we had a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a e
l-elder™s  
[indecipherable]
 which was a council, with a head of the council, which was a 

prominent Œ a prominent doctor. For many ye ars, 
a 
Lithuanian Œ he was a 
M
.
D
., and 

he Œ he was considered one of the top doctors in 
Lithuania
, Dr.
 Elkes
. And he was 

very 
strict, very 
Œ i n the beginning he didn™t want to take the job, but the Œ 
the other 
people from the Œ I mean, the head people from the ghett o came t o him, and they 

pleaded with hi m t hat he should Œ he should there Œ the y need hi m, because first of 
all, his perfect German, and his perfect Lithuanian, and perfect Russian, and 
he was 
already educated
, very cultured person. And beside that, t he respect t hat even those 
Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the captors had for Œ for him, in a certain wa y, his 

known Œ his name was very, very prominent. So they felt with t his respect hi
m 
Œ the 
Germansexpressed very big
 respect for hi m, although the y compelled this counci l 

to do their dirty work i n Œ 
in many cases. But many 
of those who belonged to the 
council, and then the council instituted a ghett o police. And we had li ke over a 
hundred police officers. Their whole uniform was only a Œ a hat, and a armband 
what sa y, Jewish police. Plus the fact the y had to use also the Œ the stars, the same

like everybody else. But these police was very instrumental in Œ 
i n many cases,in 
many 
Œ after we were already establ ished i n the ghetto, we had a Œ most of the 

people had already a regular Œ I mean, some regular job, work, you know, the job 
was because Œ nobody paid for the job. The y hardly gave you sufficient food to Œ 
for your sustenance, you know. B ut when Œ when Œ for instance, myself, I worked 

in the beginning in the 
flugplatz
, that™s an airport. And not only worked, I put in 
extra ti me, I was Œ 

Q: Speaking of airports. 

A: Yeah. It™s especially Œ you know, it™s strange, you know, you Œ 
yo u 
Œ 
when you 
go back to your country, you go back to the ci ty, which looked when you were very 
Œ when you were small, I mean, it looked t o you that it™s a fantastic cit y, because 
you didn™t know better, you know. When you go back and you see, and Œ and Œ and 

you walk this same distance that you used t o walk on the garden before, it seems to 

you so small, and so insignificant, you know, it™s a Œ it™s pathetic, you know? So I 

remember we used to walk on Œ under guard, with loaded rifles like Œ like 

supercriminals and all t he Œ although there were no cases Œ very few cases of 

resistance within the Œ within the ghetto, withi n the Œ the Œ the est abli shment. And 
you 
Œ 
you call 
Œ you do your work, and you come back after a da y™s work, whereby 
you have guards there, and they constantly changed. In the beginning the y had the 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

46
 
German guards, but  then the y start to bringing in the Œ the 
[indeci phera ble]
 the 
Russian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians. And believe me, these guards, 
they were 
i ncompassionate
. The y used to beat  you up every ti me you Œ you Œ 
you 
had to Œ to work, I mean without Œ almost without food, but constantl y, and under 

supervision, and within the cold weather, t
he y 
Œ they used to put 
a 
Œ 
a some a 
Œ 
a 
side fire in our work. From ti me t o ti me you would come and Œ and warm up your 

hands, you know, you had the mit tens, or the Œ but that do Œ didn™t mean anything 

now, because if your body doesn™t have fuel, I mean, you Œ you are Œ you still cold 

Œ it gets colder than in normal, when you have food. And the y used to have special  

Œ special woods Œ wood sticks, which the y would beat you up, you know, 
ev
-
every 
time, and without Œ wit hout mercy. And every time you used to go to warm up, you 
stayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was 

prohibited to do that in the beginni ng, but you would do it Œ come out , because 

when the Œ and so m y uncle was Œ he was a si ck man, you know, he Œ so I used to 

work for hi m, I Œ sh Œ 
becau
se there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day, 
around the clock, to work 
at
 the airport, because the y want to re-re-reestablish the 

airport, and Œ in order to be able to use that  for their Œ for their own Œ for their own 
use, for their Œ 
and lif
e was Œ was terrible. Of course, it Œ it gradually was in Œ i n 
changing. In the beginning it was a ghetto. Then after Œ after a while it  became a

concentration camp, and we have received the Œ before we were under the 
W ehrma cht
, under the military. Then we Œ we came under the juri sdiction of the 
Obersturmführer Gecker
(ph), and that was the 
SS
. It™s funny now this calls t he Œ 
the 
[indeci pherable]
. So the 
SS
, they were Œ they were terrible. They Œ  they were 
still much worse t han t he 
Wehrmacht
, because the 
Weh
rma cht
 you found 
sometimes 
between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you 

know, the y™re Œ 
the y were 
Œ they were called t o Œ to duty. But t here were still 
certain aspects of Œ of humanity, at one point, you know. But t his Œ t his 

[indecipher

 came in, and then the y declared that as a concentrat ion camp. So 
we came 
Œ 
we became a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ i n a different status, whereby this was right after Œ 
after the big

they came in with loudspeakers and they announced that next morning, five o™clock 

in the morning, after we have in a Œ in a speci al Œ a special  large pl ace, that 

everybody has to be out. Nobody can stay in the house. Not even the sick people 

can stay in t he house. Everybody has to be out. If they find somebody inside, the y 

will shoot hi m. So, next morning, everybody came out, and the Œ took some food, 

and the y Œ t he y sai d that you take Œ if you had some food, take wi th you, because 
you™re not going to be provided with any Œ any food. So everybody came out, and 
suddenly a few German trucks came in, and it was Œ with guards, and they Œ they

surrounded the place, and then the Œ the head of the Gestapo that ti me was a guy by 
the name of 
Rauca
. 
Joseph
, I thi nk was his name, 
Rauca
, and was a big German, a 

heavyset guy, and t he y came with dogs, and they started Œ they started Œ first of all, 
they searched houses, spot searched, whatever the y can find somebody. And the y 
as
-assured themselves nobody there. The y start pulling people to the left and to the 
right. Well, right awa y we saw that  the people that they pulled to the left are mostly 

children, elderly people, people who are Œ have some blemish, or have some Œ 
some 
Œ some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know. And I remember I had a 

little coat, you know, was a Œ was a fur Œ you know, the Œ the collar. So Œ and it was 

a cold Œ a cold 
[indecipherable]
 was October, it was already winter, basically in the 
Œ al most snow was Œ we were going to see. There were signs that sno w was goi ng 

to fall there. So then, I had my Œ m y grandmot her was wit h me, and I knew that 

the y are going to 
call her.
 So, it was like instinctively, you know, when the y pull  her 

away. And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to 

save her, you know, right, yeah, she was st ill with us for a couple more years 

afterward. But then they Œ  they took out all those people, and the y took them away. 

And that was a whole day operation, and we came home. Of course, we underst ood 
that they are taking t hem t o a certai n special assignment. I would like also to 
mention that the Œ the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right Œ right

after the ghetto was closed, we found out i n the next few days, that those was the 
first 500 people that they took to the 
 
, and the y shot them all . Because their ai m and their interest was t o Œ to get rid of 
the Œ of Œ of more i ntel ligent people, or people who are Œ who can plan, and who 
were Œ who had certain Œ certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to Œ to 

get rid of them right away. And Œ and then there Œ there were Œ they were in a 

certain wa y right, and they were, in a certain way the y have accompl ished their Œ 

their Œ their doing. Now this ti me Œ that was 500. Now this ti me, on October 28
th
, 
they took t hem also to the 
Ninth Fort
, and they also shot  them, and t here were 

10,000 of them. They Œ they had Œ they were more ready for these 10,000 than for 
the 500, because the y already had excavated. They had Œ they had a brigade that 
they took ahead of ti me, and they didn™t know what Œ that was a Œ 
a small
 aktion
, 
which the y took about a few dozen people. And their Œ t heir job was to excavate in 

the vicinity of the 
Ninth Fort
. And fort was large, you know, those forts were 

established bythe Russi
ans, and they were specially kept for Œ for protection of the 

city. You see, 
Kovno
 was surrounded by the 
Third Fort
, the 
Seventh Fort
, the 
Ninth Fort
. There were like four forts. And they were done by the Œ still by the Œ 
by the Russians. The y were at high Œ at high l evels, and Œ and the y were Œ had a Œ 
places for Œ for Œ for soldiers, and Œ and Œ and of course the y had places for

inmates. So the y Œ those were the 10,000 that were Œ the y Œ they liquida Œ so they 
actually cut by one-third, right awa y, the ghett o. This was also in conjunction wi th 

the burning, and with t he Œ of the small ghetto. You see, when the ghetto was 
instituted, they had the large ghetto, and they had the small ghetto. What was the 
difference? The difference was that one main t horoughfare, one main road, run 

through the Œ through t he ghetto, between the small and t he large. And what the y 

did is Œ what the y Œ what they did is the y i nstituted a Œ the y built a bri dge from the 

large ghetto to the small ghetto, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was 

always under military supervision. So the Œ the beginning, and this Œ in the small 

ghetto they had a hospital. There was a hospit al that the y converted, they have 
arranged for that, and they had a hospital with very, very Œ we had quite a number 
of doctors, and had qui te a number of Œ of Œ of patients, people who were ill, who 

were sick, who were Œ who were old, who needed Œ who needed care, and there 

were also some women who were pregnant, you know. So this hospital was full to 

capacity
. And one da y what the y decided is that Œ that the y felt that Œ apparently 
that they don™t need a hospital, and the y don™t need no sick people. So what the y did 

is the y surrounded the hospital, t he y surrounded that with ha ystack around. The y 
poured gas. They nailed the doors in the hospital, and the y burned Œ 
everybody was 
burned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, includi ng the Œ includi ng

the Œ including the pregnant women, including the Œ there was such a terrible Œ I 
mean, the Œ the Œ 
yo
u Œ  
you 
could smell
 t he Œ t he Œ the stench, you know, the Œ t he 
people. And right after that they had the Œ 
the big 
aktia
(ph), and then they Œ they 
eliminated completely Œ this small ghetto was completely, those few people who 

still were there were evacuated, were passed to the Œ to the Œ to the bi gger ghetto, 

because it became more room avail able by Œ by eli minating 10,000 people, it was 

too much room, you know, basically, based Œ based on the y Œ 
on thei rstandard. But 

this was a terrible, t errible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the Œ this Œ this was 

Œ in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know, 

that™s Œ which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain Œ for Œ like for 
children, for Œ for Œ for Œ for babies, and then old people and so on.

Beginning Tape Four
 
A: I have to mention that also, that Œ can I go on? Also being in the ghetto was very 
traumatic, but the chairmans 
from ti
me to ti me, the y called up Dr. 
Elkes
 and t
h e y 
said, we need hundred people for a special assignment. Nobody knew whether this 

assignment is for real or whether it is to take out and to shoot people, but there were 

some r
eal assignments. So I remember the 
Arbeitsamt
, which was the place where 
the Œ where the council  was, and it  was a speci al building assigned Œ it was also a 

place that ha d also a jail. Because within t he ghetto, there were somet imes found 

some peopl e who 
are 
Œ who stole and who did certain acts of Œ which was not 

permitted, you know. So I remember that when the police head in Œ i n the 
Arbeitsamt
, the Œ 
the council
, the y had a Œ a very difficult task, whom to take out? 
I mean, the chairmans t old them we need hundred people. I mean, there were also 

certain favoritism, whi ch has to Œ I 
me
an, happens from t ime to t ime, you know, 
because if you have a Œ  if you are a police officer and you have a rel at Œ 
a relat
ive 
that they want him out, I mean, you would Œ you would try to protect hi m rather 

than somebody you don™t know. So in many cases, it was a very, very difficult job 

for the Œ for the Œ f or the 
elderat
(ph), for the Œ f or the council to take. What they 
opted to do is, most of the time, is people who didn™t have families, people who Œ 

who didn™t have Œ who were not rooted for, for some reason, whom they had some

grievances or some problems with them, problematic, you know. Because many 
people have just col lapsed mentally under this pressure, you know, not everybody 

was able to be withstand that, you know, because it was Œ it wa
s like the
 game of 
the cat and Œ  and the mouse, you know, and it bites off one leg and then the other 
one. I mean, it was a constant game, you know, and especially when Œ when the Œ  

when the Gestapo used to appear and come into Œ to the ghetto. I mean, it was very 

traumatic. I have also to mention to you i s about were Œ because it 
came to m y mind 
about 
Rauca
. I had a personal Œ after I finished at the airport, I got myself a good 

brigade. Mi ne was good because I worked i n a Œ for some reason they Œ  they 

formed a new one and I was at the right time at the right place. They formed a 
brigade in a marmalade factory Œ 
andthis was fa
ntastic, you know Œ which had 
like Œ our brigadier was a guy by the name of 
Motts
(ph), who survived incidentally 

the ghetto 
[indeciphera ble]
 later i n Italy. And I was very friendly with Œ with 
h im 
and I was able to stick t o this brigade after Œ 
es
pecially after the 
flugplatz
, this was 
like a Œ 
a 
new life. Brigade was Œ we had to  Œ t hat was a Œ 
a factory
 of marmalade 
and right next to that was also a place where t hey used to produce sauerkraut and 

sour pickles Œ pickled Œ pickled, you know, cucumbers. And at l east you had Œ 
you 
were able to Œ to Œ t o get some food, you know, because sauer
kraut andpickles and 
marmalade, it's already a meal. And plus t he fact marmalade is made with sugar and

sugar is very heavy. I remember the y Œ they used to Œ I was compelled Œ I was 
pretty strong, you know, and I was compelled to Œ to take up bags of hundred kilo 
sugar Œ which is 225 pounds Œ to the third floor, where the Œ where t he y had the 
mixing of the Œ of the marmalade. And somet imes what I used t o do is, I used to 
punch a hol e in the bag and I had a Œ this Œ  thi s coat that you see on t his Œ on this 

picture, on t his one. My grandmot her had made, like 
a 
Œ 
a 
double Œ a double-deck, 

you know Œ a double Œ I mean, of the Œ the lower part. And Œ  

Q: Let Œ let  Œ I'm sorry. Can we start that t hought again and just sa y, I had 
a coat 

that m y grandmother Œ 

A: Oka y, I had a coat t hat m y grandmother fixed it up in such a fashion that she 
made like a Œ hidden pockets. And when I carried the sugar, I used to punch a hole 
in the Œ 
in the 
bag and the su Œ then Œ and make from Œ from paper, make like 
a 
little canal, and I used t o canal the Œ 
canal the 
sugar from Œ from 
t he bag
, 
directly to 
my
 Œ 
to my coat, youknow.And this 
Œ t his was very, very helpful in a certain wa y 
to survive because sugar is Œ is very nutri tious. And Œ and in one case, there were Œ 

we had a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
German civilian who was very much connected t o the Gestapo. 

One Œ 
and beside
 that, what I used to do also, I used to steal marmalade. But the 
only wa y to steal t hat was in Œ in Œ we had li ke Œ like they have now Œ you know, 
the metal 
C oca

Col a
 containers Œ using a container. And Œ and many ti mes I

burned my
 Œ 
m y 
st Œ 
my 
Œ  
m y 
stomach because I used to steal that  and I used to 
insert it right here, and then with a coat, I used to close it up. And Œ and I used t o 
pull it out from the ber Œ from the na Œ I Œ 
I 
was not able to have accessibility to this 
when it was already placed in a cool  place, so I had to take that when it was hot. 
And this was Œ 
it was someti mest errible. But n
otwithstanding t hat, I felt that the Œ 

the Œ the pain of the Œ of the burning was worth it in order to Œ t o accomplish t he Œ 

the Œ to 
accompl
ish the ai m Œ 
you know, thegoal. 
 
Q: I want t o ask you a question. 
Rae
(ph)
 
had Œ when 
Rae
(ph) tal ked to you the 
other day, she mentioned that you said something about carrying sugar up to the 

Gestapo.  
A: Yeah, that was in Œ 
in my 
Œ 
in my school, where
 I went, to the gymnasium. I 
had Œ I was sent Œ twice, I was sent there for special work, also carrying 225 pounds 
of  on to Œ also to t he top floor. The y converted our school  to a Œ the y made it to 
a 
Œ 

to a storage place. And Œ and we had to Œ we had to do th
at
, and that was Œ 
that was 
before that.  

Q: 
Oka y. Would youtell me 
Œ you tell me about that though?  
A: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.About
 Œ  
Q: What di d you do, because I'm Œ  
A: I Œ what  I did is, we had to carry these bags of Œ they used to take us with the

truck, come to the mai n entrance, and we used to have to Œ to Œ about five or six of 
us, go up t o the top floor where the y had the Œ the sugar, and they had the Œ 
had the 
purpose to place that in a high level, that it should not be stolen or somet hing. So 
they Œ we Œ  we used to carry Œ 
carry 
them to Œ to the cert Œ to certain places for Œ 
for Œ for stirring purposes. And Œ but that was not related t o the marmalade factory, 
which it was a separate Œ  

Q: Oka y. But whi le we're on that, who was up there?  

A: There was a Œ there was a military storage for the Œ for the German Œ for the 

German arm y. And it was not precisely Gestapo, it was a military. Gestapo is Œ I 

was Œ I w
asthreatened by this 
Meyer
(ph), when I was in the factory. One da y he 
caught me with 
Œ with this Œ with this marmal ade, and he j ust waved his finger and 
says, next ti me, you're going to go to the Gestapo if I catch you. 
It was
 Œ it was 
something like that. So he was very generous at that ti me, you know. He just kicked 

me and that™s all, and t ook awa y t he Œ 
Q: 
Wh en
 
you 
Œ when you went up to take the sugar to the  stor Œ 
this mil itary 
storage place, did you hear people talking, did you see anyt hing t hat was 

particularly interesting? 
 
A: Not Œ we were t oo busy in Œ in Œ in carrying again, and be 
able t
o carry the load. 

That was Œ that was  Œ 
actually, m y mi
 Œ our 
mi
nd was blanked out  at that ti me. We

Œ we were not able even to communicate because the y Œ t he y used to Œ when Œ 
when it came to a Œ 
to a 
job like t his, it 's not like the airport where you had a shovel 
and a Œ 
and a
 pick and you have to dig and thi s. You know, this Œ thi s was Œ the y 
had to be unloaded in a Œ in a certai n time and they Œ and you had to Œ 
you
 had to 
rush.And if you wouldn™t 
rush, 
they 
Œ the y just clubbed you. So at thi s Œ this 
mo
ment, you were Œ you were just trying to Œ to keep up with your st rength, in 
order to be able to fulfill the Œ ful-fulfill the Œ the job. There was also, in Œ in 
cases 
before I Œ I became Œ I start worki ng Œ notwithstanding if we worked at this 

[indecipher
able]
 brigade, from ti me to ti me, t hey take Œ t ook us to some other 
places. And I have t o tell you something which is Œ which was very much inscribed 
in my 
Œ in my memory, is that 
[indecipherabl e]
 in the Œ i n 1941, beginning '42, 
the y brought to 
Lithuania
, echelons Œ trai n loads with the boxcars, you know, of 
people from 
Austria
 and from 
Czechoslovakia
 and from some other places. And 
amazingly Œ  

Q: I've got to stop you. I hate doing 
[break] 

A: So that Œ 

Q: Actually, I need that  you to start that whole Œ  
A: Yeah. There™s a very remarkable something that I have to bring it up because 
there are certai n aspects of 
me 
bei ng in the Œ i n the camps that Œ that I have to 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

highlight. And one of them is that  this incredi ble experience that I had. And namely, 
they start bringing, to the railroad station, echelons Œ boxcars with the Jews from 

Austria
 and 
Germany
. The y called that, we found out later, the Hebrew 
siedlung
. 
Hebrew 
siedlung
 
basically means, placefrom one 
Œ take t hem from one place and 
put them t o other plac
e,
 in German. And t hese train came with cars loaded with 
pianos, with furniture, with all ki nds of luxury items, to make believe to those 

people, when they Œ because you see, when they t ook out from 
Germany
 or from 
Austria
, Jews to send t hem to Œ to their Œ to their massacre, to their Œ I mean, to 

their Œ to their graves, t o their killi ngs, was Œ apparently, t he y had a certain Œ 
a 

certain Œ had to handle it in a certain way. They tried to convince t hem t hat the y are 
being taken to other place, just only to Œ t he y have to take t hem to Œ to Œ to other 
places. So when they came Œ and at  that ti me, I was working for the Gestapo 

brigade. There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many 

people have tried very hard to work in thi s brigade, 
because
 this brigade was alwa ys 
connected with certain Œ certain thi ngs that had to do wit h food. And there was 

many possibilities to Œ to fill up your stomach, you know, to be Œ to Œ  not to be 
hungry. And this t i me t hey needed additional Œ additional people. So apparently, 
they took me and they t ook a Œ a group of other people to t hat task. And I Œ and I 
saw the wa y this echelons came, and I saw that they came in Œ in like, in plush 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

trains. It was not the Œ t he Œ s
ome
 Œ some boxcars came also at the same ti me, but 
they came for a Œ for Œ for a purpose of Œ of baggage and Œ and some other things. 
But these trains came with Œ and the people with their jewelry, with everything, and 
Œ and you could see very high standard people who came. And I knew exactly what 
they are doing with Œ what the y are going to do with them. Before Œ this 
Rauca
 

came over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were like, six trucks, six guys, and 

he said to us Œ he said, you see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these 

people. There is no way t hat you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing. If I 

see yo
ur lips movi ng, I know that you are trying to tell them something or give Œ 
send them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your 
head. And he just 
li
ke, took his pi stol and Œ and Œ and Œ and just scraped our Œ our Œ 
our faces, you know, with that, to Œ to Œ t o impress upon us that he means business, 
you know. The difficult y was by knowing what Œ what™s going t o happen to those 

people. How do we tell  th
em 
Œ 
or whether 
Œ whether to tel l them was the right 

thing, or not to tell  them. It was so difficult. Now, our task was to take out from the 

windows, a German with Œ with l oudspeaker would sa y to the Œ sa y to one of the 

cars
 Œ plush cars and say 
[speaks Ge
rman]
. It means, give me your packs. You 
have a few kilometers. You have to go a few kilometers, please give out your 

packages because it™s going to be very burdensome and we are going Œ pla-placing 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

60
 
these packages in the trucks and we are going to deliver t hem. And make sure to 
inscribe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return that to 

you. I knew that that™s Œ that™s fallacy. I mean, this is Œ where the y are taking them 
is to the 
Ni nth Fort
 and it™s Œ it™s abo
ut 10or 12 mileswalking. It™
s not a couple of 
kilometers. And that™s what™s going to happen to them. And in one case, I saw a 

lady, which I Œ pretty young lady, and Œ and I really felt Œ with her husband, felt Œ a 

couple apparently Œ and I felt very bad and I Œ I tried to Œ to explain t o them, to tell 

them that Œ of course, we were already involved in taking the packages, and Œ and I 

Œ I Œ I looked around, I didn™t see 
Rauca
 there, apparently he went  to have 
something to drink or s
omething. And 
Œ and I said to them that, t
h e y ar
e taking you 
to your deat h. Try Œ when Œ 
when you 
Œ when Œ when 
you 
will march, try to Œ to 
escape or tr
y to 
Œ to do something or something. You know, the peopl e didn™t 
believe me. 
They just didn™t trust me. The y trusted the Germans by that time, but 

they didn™t Œ they didn™t trust me. The y looked at me and l ooked at  me, and the y 

looked at me like I am Œ like I am trying t o Œ and then I Œ I Œ I felt very bad about  

the fact
 Œ I mean, I Œ I Œ I Œ I felt scared that t hey should not Œ t he y should not give 
me
 Œ turn me over, or say t hat I tried to Œ to tel l them. This Œ this was the 
Œ 
this was 
the 
fanatism
. Th-
Th
e German
 Œ t he German Jews were very big fanatic. They felt 
that they were first Germans and then Jews. That was thei r big Œ their big problem.

 Œ it would

. The y used to put  in, next year in 
Berlin
.  Th-Th-Thi s Œ 
this incident I remember so vividly. And I remember when we took the packages, 
and we took them directl y to the Gestapo. And the Gestapo, the y had a big Œ a big 
warehouse where they just threw them in one big pile and then the y used to have a Œ 

those peopl e who worked at the Gestapo used to sort them out and place Œ for 

instance, place different items in Œ based on a list that the y had, which items have to 

go here and there. You know, they were very met iculous and very organized. The 

Germans, they were extremely organized. I mean, when it came to organization i t 

was Œ I mean, the y were leaders in the world on that
, you know
.

A: This was Œ I™m not sure, but I think it was in the beginning of the Œ of ‚42 or the

everybody. And they Œ they didn™t put them in the camps or ghetto or anything, but 
they took t hem out  and Œ and in Œ in Œ 
in certainsecluded spaces and the y made

And it happened to be t hat m y father was one of the eld-eldest in the Œ in

was to Œ to give hi m some harbor Œ shelter, you know, harbor hi m, and at Œ hi mself, 
but he said, it has t o be the whole family. The y said, the family we cannot do, you 
yourself. He said no way. Wherever the family goes, I Œ I go. And of course, 

afterwards, last Œ 
two years
 ago I was in 
Lithuania
, and I went t o the place that Œ 

very secluded small place, a few kilometers from the city where t he y took there Œ 

there were like 2,750 people, children, elderly, and Œ whi ch they Œ they have 

massacred Œ massacred them there. The y kept them for a short time. We had a Œ in 

our city we had a lit tle lake, and there was Œ  there was a count that had his pala

certain accommodati ons and the y kept there, t he people, you know, for Œ for a few 
d ays 
and then the y took them out  to this, three kilometers from t he cit y, the name 

was

away from newspapers, from Œ but, of course, when we went to Œ to Œ  outside to 
work in the brigades, we had someti mes opportunities to Œ to exchange views wit h 
some Lithuanians. We had also a case where I had m y cousin

we had to cut some wood. And it was col d and the Œ the guard Œ lady Œ it was a 

Lithuanian lady, she felt pity on us,

 owned Œ she was a Œ a opera

and some other thi ngs. And then she Œ 
we werereminded, my cousin.Sh

min d
 Œ the wa y where we were, cutting the wood and the way she invited us to the 
house and t hat she Œ she had even tears in her eyes, and she said t hat Œ she 
was very 
human, you know, was 
very much against what 
Œ what Œ what was going on and 
happening. She talked to us in Lithuanian, the guard didn™t understand anywa y, so Œ 

so she was very open. And right awa y she gave us tea and some Œ 
some 
soup and 
some piece of bread. Incidentally, Lithuanian food was very good bread, the Œ the Œ 

the butter, and all this. We Œ 
Lithuania
 used to export to 
England

products to Œ to England in large numbers. Now, of course, when the Russians

A: There were some Œ some factories within the ghetto. They were mostly for 
youngsters and for people who learned a trade. I had, for instance, a t eacher of 
mat hematics by the name of 
Faulkman
(ph). He was a brilliant, brilliant guy. He 
became a shoe
maker in the ghetto. And you know, if you had a trade you had more 
Œ more possibilities to Œ to survive and to Œ you know, especially, you know, there 
were many 
Germans that used to come in and say, l
ook, m y bootsare
 Œ fix th
em
 Œ 
and this and that, and Œ  
or m y 
Œ need some buttons here, and I need certain things to 
Œ to be fixed. 
And t
radespeople were able t o Œ to f ulfill their requirement. Now, 
there were Œ basic
ally t he 
Œ the ghetto were 
stattin
(ph), t hat™s the way t he y were 
called. The g hetto factories were Œ basically what the y di d is the y used to Œ to 
manufacture there 
many ite
ms for the arm y, li ke, all kind of uniforms Œ everything 
from uniforms, from hats, from underwear, from Œ from boots. And Œ and we had 
shoe makers and we had tailors and we had Œ we had all kind of tradespeople who 

were there. We had al so something very i nteresting, which is going t o surprise you, 

that I™ m going to tell you. We had a symphony orchestra within the ghetto. We had 

people who were very talented, extremely talented. The y Œ they 
were performing 
someti mes with the permi ssion of the Œ of the Œ of the guards and so forth. We had 
to announce that Œ t hat we™re going to have a concert Œ 
a concert 
there. There were 

people Œ writers who wrote and who Œ and of course, doctors. I could mention to

you now, we didn™t have a hospital, so we made a provisi onal place where we used 
to take care of sick people, and Œ but the word was, don™
t g
et sick if you want to 
survive. 
Andthat was, don™
t get sick if you want to survi ve. 
So how can
 you 
prevent that?  Somet imes, you know, wit h the snow and the bad weather and the 
colds. But the Œ the inst inct, you know, the force of wanting to survive was 

someti mes so Œ so strong, you know, that  is st ronger than Œ than Œ than Œ than 
any 
bacter
ia or anyt hing. You know, t he y over Œ you can overcome something. And this 
is without food. And I m yself, when I used to work in

Beginning Tape Five 
Q: Were the workshops or factories used as a way to essentially hide people? 
A: The y used to Œ 
we had
 also, someti mes a influx from people who were 
wandering around, and the y didn™t find themselves on the outside. They were being 

harbored by some Lithuanians, but up to a poi nt, they start in jeopardizing their 

lives 
with the
 Lithuanians. So in many cases, some of the people came back to the 

ghetto. And they Œ how did the y come back? They infiltrated through the brigades 

that used to come, they used to sneak in some way, and the y used to come in. Now, 

some of those people, you had to establish them, you had to give them ma Œ because 

we had identification cards. Everyone in t he ghetto has a identification. We had t o 
falsify a card, put them in, and some of those people also became employed in t he 
ghetto 
estattin
(ph) Œ in Œ in the ghetto factories. They were Œ some of them, they 

were also harboring, in certain cases, somet imes preparing some weaponry, making 

Œ making bullets, and other Œ in Œ i n the Œ ™41, we had already a Œ 
a guy by the 
name of 
Jai me
(ph) 
Jellin
(ph). 
Jel lin
(ph) was a very educated, very i ntelligent 
young man whose fami l y was known for many years. The y had a Œ 
they had 
bookstores. And t he y had Œ they 
were 
Œ 
they were 
very, very known in the Œ in the 
community as 
Œ as very educated, and Œ and very intelligent people. So this

a 
Œ you know, when people used to go out to work in the brigades, t here were 
certain contacts, from t ime to ti me, with some Lithuanians, and some Jewish people 

who lived their life like Lithuanians. And through them, through cont acts Œ which 
in many cases they failed, because you never knew who is going to betra y you. You 
had sometimes to have confidence. But there were passwords, and there were some 

certain wa ys of Œ of protecting yourself, and so the y started this movement of 

getting people out, and Œ and getting in Œ getti ng to the woods. There was the Œ the 

understandi ng was that  the Germans were very much afraid of the woods, because 

there were Œ there was already started a resi stance. But you see, there were a 
do uple
 
Œ a double Œ a double problem in t his respect, because to get out from the ghetto, 
and to reach the woods, you had to cross, and you had to Œ to cr Œ g-get involved 
with some Œ with some Lithuanians, in Œ i n many cases, and you real ly didn™t know 

Œ you see, they were not the Germans. The Œ the biggest problem were the 
Lithuanians, because they know Œ they knew t he Germans wouldn™t Œ wouldn™t 

differentiate a Jew from a Lithuanian, but  the Lithuanians did Œ did Œ did Œ did 

knowthat. From m y 
Œ for instance m yself, I Œ  I had few friends who were by 

themselves, and the y Œ they decided the
y™
re going to join the Œ the partisans. There 
was a very good friend of mine, he was the son of the rabbi from

was a small  city in 
Lithuania

who now lives in Œ 
[indecipherable] Golden
. H
e has a 
Œ was a terrible Œ a terrible 
Œ a terrible end to this young, bril liant, bright man. He joi ned the part isans, and i n a 
skirmish Œ the y were some wa y betrayed i n a skirmish. The y had a Œ they Œ the y 
had a fight between them and the Œ and Œ and the Germans, he was wounded. And 
they had to amputate his leg. And something happens th Œ happened t hat this is 

very, very, very Œ I mean, it™s sometimes very hard to describe that. Til this da y, I 

don™t know who t his was, because t he y wouldn™t Œ the y wouldn™t sa y. The y were a 

few of his colleagues. The y had to pull a straw who should kil l hi m, because the y 

had to move out from t his place and the y didn™t want to leave him suffering. So one 

Œ one Œ one of them pulled the straw and Œ and had to pull Œ put  a bullet in 
his head, 
because the y just couldn™t cope with somebody that was wounded, was ha Œ 
that his 
leg had to be amput ated, you know. He had gangrene. And this was a Œ was a prince 

Œ prince of a guy, you know, I remember Œ you know, it™s Œ it™s Œ was very sad, and 

Œ but they have a Œ I had a number of Œ 
of friends who 
Œ  whom I knew exactly 
where the y are going, and we used to supply them with, from ti me to time with Œ 

with products. And I will explain t o you, and t hat™s the reason why I wanted to tell 

you the sto ry, what  Œ what it came Œ what Œ  what I learned to do. I used to Œ in 
many cases, I used t o t ake out the Œ 
m y 
Œ take  off my stars. I used to go out and Œ 
and exchange Œ I used t o have like shirts, or somet hing else, you know, if I didn™t

have, I used to take from somebody else
, became some 
Œ something like a Œ 
like a 
business. And then one day, we had our 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 the factory of the 
marmalade on one side of the street. On the ot her side of the street  was a company 
by the name of 
Pieno
(ph) 
Sendri s
(ph). That was a milk products, I would call it a 
factory, processing place, where the y used t o make yogurt, and Œ  and buttermilk, 
and everything made from milk products. One sa y, while working in 
sadiva
(ph), at 
break ti me, when we had lunch, I came down to the basement, and then I saw in the 

basement a Œ like a sewer pipe. A large pi pe, was maybe 20 some inches of 

diameter. And then I st art putting two and two together. I saw that  pipe with 

direction was toward the street, and I told m y f Œ one of my friends that I had there 
Œ and he happened t o be his Œ his life as friends. We became sick later, and I Œ he 
used to work, and he used to help and was 
[indecipherabl e]
 
told him, 
Louis 
Prow
ther
(ph) is his name, he is now an engineer,
 
he lives in 
Israel
. I said, 
Louis
, 
watch out for me. Let me see what™s on the ot her end of the pipe. And I cli mbed in 

and I cli mbed through the pipe. And when I came out, I came out t o the Œ to the 

heating place, you know, to the Œ you know, where the y have the Œ t he heating 

place for the Œ for the Œ for Œ for the building of the Œ the processi ng building of Œ 
you know, where they had the Œ the Œ what is that called? A Œ the y Œ they had boiler 
rooms. And Œ and the guy, I saw a guy, a Lithuanian guy that was there, he just got

72
 
Œ got Œ got  Œ got scared when he saw, because for the pipe was there, t hen I came 
out like from a chi mney, you know. I s Œ I am sure that he felt that the devil coming 

out there. But then I identified myself, I sa y I am from Œ from the other side, from 
the 
sadiva
(ph), and I would like t o find out what is Œ about their products what they 
have, whether there i s a possibility that we can bring in some products of Œ milk 
products in the ghetto. To make the story short, from that  da y, I became very 

friendl y wit h this guy, and I used to bring different items, exchange with him, and I 

used to carry back to the ghetto, all  kinds of milk products. And the y gave me a 

nickname, t he y called me 
Tevye 
the
 
Milchhi ker
,
 
you know, from shalo Œ from Œ 
from 
Sho l e
m Aleichem
, you know, that, from the Œ the  famous play, you know, 
Tevye the Milkman
? That was my na Œ I lost  my name, I sa Œ and from that ti me I 

used to bring in a l ot of Œ a lot of products, of mil k products. 

Q: What di d you give t hem? 

A: Pardon? 

Q: What di d you give t hem? 

A: All kind of Œ all kind of cloth, you know. Shoes or whatev Œ whatever, shirts or 

something. If I didn™t have m yself, I used t o trade with somebody. And I was now 
in Œ 
recently to 
Israel
, and 
Prow
ther
(ph) remembers that, he says Œ he remembers 
m y nickname, you
 know. 
Prowther
(ph), y
eah. So this became a Œ 
a 
Œ a new trend, 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick  
 
September 22, 1994 
 
 

 
73
 
and truthfully, there were many people that were being Œ 
werehelped by that, you 
know, because it was a Œ 
a some 
Œ a product which was Œ and this guy used to have 
that as Œ 
as mu 
Œ 
as much 
Œ as much as I was able to carry t hrough, you know. In 
case that the y would catch me, and it would spill it out, or they would hit me, or like 

in Œ in this picture, I remember that I Œ I had some potatoes that I brought in, and 

they searched us. But sometimes for five, there were Lithuanian guards. A guy, one 

guy, name was 
Ratneris
(ph), I remember his name. And we Œ we knew already, he 

used to take five dollars to come i n, when somebody came with certai n Œ certain 

things, and he would Œ he would look the other wa y around hi m, and let you 

through, you know. So there were some tolerance, you know, some Œ some people. 
Lorus
(ph) wouldn™t Œ would do i t Œ just  search you, and find and Œ and beat you up, 
you know. But that was a Œ a incident whi ch Œ which happened to me, and Œ 
Q: You weren™t carryi ng that stuff through the pipe? 

A: Yeah, right. I used t o attach that to m y leg with a Œ wi th a piece of Œ of cord, and 

Œ and slide through, pull it Œ 
pull itin, youknow. We m
ade hi m Œ he made for us a 
Œ 
a special at tachmen
t which shouldn™t be spil led out or anything, you know, that Œ 
special bott les, you know. There were that ti m e, there were now Œ no paper cartons, 
so everythi ng was i n bottles. The refreshment s were in bottles, large bottles like 
this.

Q: Can you Œ 
can you
 j ust sa y the word pi pe? Can you say I Œ I had to carry this out 
through Œ back through the pipe? 
A: Of course. The Œ the only way to Œ to communicate, was through this pipe, 
which Œ whereby through this pipe, I was able to carry through different Œ different 
items, you know, of different products, and especially mil k products. And this gave 

me certain 
fame in th Œ in the camp, this Œ wel l, 
the fame 
Œ nobody looked for fame 
because 
when the word spread too fast, that can be also counterproductive, because 

they would start watchi ng you, and Œ and findi ng out, and this Œ this could mean a 

very bad end. 

Q: How would you describe what t he ghett o looked like? 
A: The ghet to looked li ke 
a 
Œ like a little jai l, comprised of individual houses and 
buildings. It looked like a Œ a prison, surrounded with barbed wire 
[indecipherable]
 
guards wit h high l ights. It looked l ike a place of Œ a place of no return, I would put 

it this wa y, because nobody of those beginning 33,000 people Œ although everybody 

dreamed Œ was getti ng liberated. But in Œ i n his deep mind, he knew that this is a Œ 

thi-this is a Œ 
a 
Œ a dream that™s never going to be fulfilled. It Œ it was as Œ as ti me 

went by, we Œ we found ourselves more secluded, more guarded, more Œ we Œ 
we
 
found also when Œ when the front starts turning Œ turned around, and then like 

Stalingrad
, we 
f 
Œ we felt that there is a cert ai n additional pressure on us, because 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

the Germans, they felt already that the y are not Œ the y didn™t accomplish what the y 
wanted 
accomplish infour months, 
because
 this winter was for the, like 
Stalin
 used 
tosay, m y best 
Œ t he best general, i s general  winter. Well, this is what  devastated 
the German army. It  devastated them to a point, you know, the Germans, they Œ 

they were cut clean, shaved, nicely dressed, you know, nice with thei r uniform, with 

their Œ with their Œ this was a phase. But when the y Œ when the y were encountered 

by hi m, when they felt this terrible winter, you know, and where t he y didn™t have 

the supplies, because partisans, and especially in 
thebegi nning, most ly Russian 

partisans have cut off the supplies Œ all the supplies line were just shattered. And 

they were not able t o get the suppl ies, where t hey had to have their li ce, and the y 
had to have their Œ t hei r Œtheir flea, and Œ 
and the 
Œ and th -the discomfort, and not 
have the food in their ti me, and Œ and the rifles were Œ I mean, the col d winter was 
so cold their rifles were stuck, you know, they were not able to Œ t o shoot when they 

had to shoot. And so they Œ they Œ they start Œ they had different thoughts, and t he Œ 

and the punishment for those people that al s Œ also in the camps, who were in there 

guarding the camps, was also to send them to the Russian front. The Russian front, 

the expression to send you to the Russian front was like a sentence of death to a 
German sol dier. So they were Œ 
an
- and when t hey were in this state of mind, that 
they saw that things have turned around, t he y also felt that the y have to punish t heir

what Œ wer Œ wer Œ what Œ how can the y ex-express their Œ their frustration, their Œ 
their Œ their Œ their disappoint ment? They cannot say anyt hing against their Œ 

against thei r Œ a-agai nst their leadership, because the y wouldn™t do that to Œ dare t o 
do that. So what t he y did is the y Œ they put the biggest squeeze on Œ on the 
prisoners. The y want to show their leadership t hat the y are better equipped, the y are 

better Œ they know bett er how to handle, how t o Œ how to squeeze, and how to 

eliminate their Œ their prisoners. Their Œ this would give t hem like a Œ like a pat on 

the shoulder, sa ying you™re doing a good job, you know. 

Q: So the only wa y people got out  of the ghetto would be with a work brigade?  

A: Yeah, that™s right, yeah. Some Œ some tried to escape, but the y were Œ 
Q: But the only legal way? 
A: Œ 
they were

was going on in t he ghetto Œ 

A: We had Œ 

Q: Œ did you have soup kitchens, did you have tutoring? Was there any semblance 

of normal routines? 
A: There were in a certain wa y, cert ain rout ines, like we had Œ like I mentioned

reading the Torah, reading some scriptures or Œ or we had also poems. There were Œ 
there were composers, there were people who composed hidden musi c in ghetto. 

We had 
Œ we had li ke hymns, whi ch we chanted when we used to go out and Œ and 
walk, and sometimes we were quietly singi ng, you know, the Œ with Œ with 

incredible

with this

you know, it™s Œ i t Œ the hymn is about that our destiny is being written not with Œ 

not with bullets from in a gun, whi ch is a 
Mauser
, but with Œ wit h blood. And 
we 
expect still to see the sunshine from the comi ng da y, because we Œ we don™t know 
what the next da y i s going to bring us, but we hope that t he next day i s going to give 

us a little bit more hope, more Œ more Œ more a way to survive, and t o put 

everything behind us. It was basically that. That™s called t he partisan hymn. And of 
course, there were som e other Œ some other songs that were Œ the y were put 
together, and they were Œ

tired, and in the few hours, the sleep was Œ was essential t o Œ to be able to get up 
next morning at five o™clock and Œ and Œ and go through that there, 
because we 
were brought back i n ghetto, was already nighttime, so we only had few hours. But 
within Œ 
even 
with Œ within this miserable life, we found ourselves certain Œ certai n 
way of life which Œ which was like a shadow of the Œ of the normal l ife, you know, 

it Œ it Œ it was still Œ the hope was alwa ys very, very, very big, you know, it™s Œ 

everybody Œ especially when the front turned around, and Œ and we saw that the 

Germans are getting nervous, you know, and day by da y t he y went by. Then they 

started with the Œ the aks Œ 
aktion 
from the children. 

Q: Oka y, but let Œ let Œ I still want  to stay on this a minute, more about what was Œ  
A: But Œ but there Œ 
yeah  
Œ there was Œ 
Q: Œ 
what was 
goi ng on, were kids 
studying, were 
Œ  
A: The y were studying. We had Œ we had teachers, we had like a Œ 
a 
Œ like a school, 
without calling that by name school. Kids were being prepared. We had a Œ 
a ma 
Œ 
certain weddings in the get Œ and Bar Mitzvah in the ghett o. It was Œ 
yeah.
 
Q: Was thi s allowed, or Œ 

A: It was Œ  it was Œ 
it was 
Œ you know, t he y Œ in a certain wa y the y Œ so long i t was 
quiet, and no, it was not a Œ a rebell ious trend, the y Œ in certain occasion, the y Œ 

they overlooked that. They wouldn™t Œ the y wouldn™t get

inside the ghetto we hardly had Œ only in Œ in special cases, we had Lithuanians, or 
Œ they were always on the outside, they were Œ someti mes, if the y had somebody Œ 
betrayed somebody, or there was something investigation, they would come in, but 
normally Œ although when they would come i n, the y would go direct l y to the 
J udenra t
, to 
El k
es
, to meet with t hem. This was it. The y met with t hem, and Œ and 
most of th
e time 
Elk
es
 used to go to the Gestapo and meet  with Œ  wit h them there, 
to the city, or to 
Bürgermeister
, the mayor of the city. B ut normally, within the 

city, there was a Œ I mean, if you l ooked Œ I mean from Œ from the upper part, you 

know, through a glass cover, and imagine you see the ghet to, you see the whole 

ghetto, you would see a Œ a life, a going on, you know, a Œ al most like a normal l ife, 
with Œ wit h every ingredient of Œ of Œ of Œ of a normal life, in a certain way. You 
had every Œ you had there Œ you had there everyt hing, most
ly
, except  for the food 
was problematic, but they find, in certain ways, you know, people that  went out, 

they came. Sometimes the y overlooked Œ not ev Œ not all the times, they were very 

harsh on bringing in food. There were sometimes that the Jews have supplied the Œ 

the Germans with cigarettes. How did they get the cigarettes? With a question mark. 

Th-They™ve got cigarettes. They Œ

difficult, because it was very intense, you know. But i Œ first couple of years we Œ 
we were able Œ we knew exactly where the holidays, we t ried to observe them in a 

certain wa y, of course not Œ not t oo Œ we were not able to observe them i n Œ in Œ  
full y, but i n a certai n Œ in a certain wa y we did observe them, yeah. 
Q: You were s Œ you were starting to talk about some of the actions around  

A: Yeah. There were Œ they were constantly, and Œ and I found out later that the 
aktions 
were Œ it was a Œ the y were systematic. The y used to do that not only in 
[indecipherable]
, but i n every single ghetto that the y had. They were exactly the 

same day, same ti me, same fashion. This something we found out afterwards, 

because it was very organized, very meticulous. Like this day, which was also a Œ 
a 
incredible da y, it was i n ™43, and t hat da y I di dn™t go to work for some reason. You 
see, my uncle became t he Œ the head of the 
parama
, of the bread dist ribution, t he y 
used to bring in bread and Œ and the y used to Œ considered a very honest person, you 

know, the y Œ and of course, he had a few people working for him, and the y would 

come
 in and Œ 
and get 
Œ the distri bution of the bread became somet hi ng inside Œ 
inside the ghetto. It  was the Œ 
the brea
d brou Œ brought in with horses and Œ and 

platforms, and then they unloaded that, and then Œ so, we used to live in the same 
place, we used to Œ we moved from the place that we were, in a place where it was 
emptied out, and 
Varniu
(ph) 


 was this, 
Varniu
(ph) three. And there were the

81
 
distribution of the bread, and we li ved in t he Œ in this Œ t his room there. And we 
were not too far from t he gate. There were like two or three gates for where Œ 
why 

you 
Œ you would come out and thi-this gat e was mostly not for the reason of Œ of 
going to work, but for the Œ for supplies, sometimes, when they brought into the 
ghetto. We™re very friendly with t he horse people, you know, wit h this Œ with the Œ 

with the people who had the Œ 
the horses, were 
strong, you know, the y always were 
very friendly with my uncle. So, one da y the y Œ when everybody went to work, and 

some reason I Œ I Œ I was home and then t he y Œ doing something. I think m y uncle 

asked me to sta y with him, and d-do something, which I don™t remember exactly. 

Suddenly, the gates opened up from the 
Varniu
(ph) 

gates, you know, where 
the supply came in, and a bunch of German Œ German buses came in. The windows 

were Œ were blackened, you couldn™t see t hrough the window, you know? And one 

with the loudspeaker, start announcing that  nobody should move til further advice. 

And right awa y the y Œ oh yes, I forgot to mention, that the same da y, a da y before, 

they called Œ the Germ ans, the German 
O bersturmführer 
called up the Œ the head 

of the council, and t old hi m that there is going to come in the Œ 
some German 
Œ 
some German supervisors are going to come in, because there might be a change of 
guard, and they want the police should be neatly dressed, t heir boots properly 
shining, their uniforms, whatever they were, the armbands, the y shoul d be all in

order, because the y are going to make a check on the pol ice also. And, now goi ng 
back, that t he bosses came in to the ghetto wit h the loudspeaker, and the police were 

called Œ 
Q: I™m sorry, I know this is Œ 
[break] Œ 
only t wo minutes on thi s tape, but I think 
you can tell  this st ory. 

A: Right, yeah. 

Q: Soon as the plane st ops. 

A: Oka y. My Œ m y aunt™s brother, 
Chai m Levner
(ph), he was a police officer. 
Nice, awful nice guy. He used to live wit h us 
[indeci
pherable]
 and we used to live 
together. So he was also one of those officers. I mean, the y Œ they asked for the 
whole police force to gather, and then when they gathered, the first car that came 
out Œ the buses were behind, the first car came out, it™s lik
e a 
Œ 
a 
Jeep
, and came out 
three Germans, and thi s was Œ and I was watching through the window what 

happened, I was inside the house. And the y tol d to the police, the y Œ t o get in Œ into 

Œ in two li nes, one behi nd the other one, three lines. And three rows 

[indecipherable]
. And then they told them Œ t hey asked each of them the y should 

mention their name. And right afterward, the y told them the y should sit down on the 
ground, suddenly. So everybody sat down, you know, in this, i n this way, you 
know, crossing Œ crossing the leg. My uncle Œ m y aunt™s brother, for some reason Œ

83
 
I mean, apparently he had a feeling that something is wrong there. He gets 
convulsions, and he was not able to sit down. So the chairman just pulled out the 

gun and just shot hi m, right there. And I was in Œ in Œ that was right in front of me, 
in the Œ in the window. And then, he was carried away, and then they took all the 
police, and the y put  them in Œ in the Œ in t he first Œ in the first bus, everybody, 

including t he chief, everybody. And right after that, the y started the children™s 

aktion
. Was to take out all the children that were still left, and Œ the children and 
the elderly people. We had in our Œ there, where we had the bread supply, we had a 

Œ 
a 
Œ a basement. And we were able to bring down m y Œ m y cousin, and place her 

there, you know. And t his was the last ti me that we were Œ that we felt that she 
should remain in t he ghetto, because we felt that Œ and th-this da y, they took away Œ 
the y took awa y all t he children. They went  from house, to house, and the y pulled 

out the children and elderl y people, and the y took them out. And of course, you 

know where the y took t hem. Now, when t he people came from the brigades home Œ

End of Tape Five

Beginning Tape Six 
Q: Oka y. We were talking about t he children being Œ  
A: Where Œ where Œ where Œ where in the ghetto, at the children™s 
aktion
, it was 
specially devised to get  out all of the children from the ghetto. And in order to 
implement that, the y had also to take out al l the police because this was also Œ there 

were also children from t he police officers, and Œ and you know how a father would 

react seeing his chil d being dragged and beaten and taken to a Œ to a bus and then 

taken awa y. So after this Œ this happened Œ and this was very fast, you know, the y Œ 
the y had a big number of Œ of gendarmes, of 
SS
 people who Œ who implemented 
this function. They went from house to house and the y Œ 
t h e y 
knew exactly which 
house had children. They had already a list. Apparently, previously t he
y have 
Œ 
t h e y 
have asked for the Œ for the composition of the people who lived in t he Œ 
in each
 Œ 
in each house. You know, it was Œ so they Œ 
they 
had certai n records , or somebody 
gave them t he records. And the y 
in
discri minat el y Œ I mean, the y have Œ they have 
walked into each house, pulled out Œ pulled out the children. And most of the 
children were Œ 
especially the
 Œ the older ones were Œ their mothers were Œ were at 

work at thi s ti me. There were only a number of mothers who, when they took the 
children, they didn™t want to go with their kids. The y wouldn't let them Œ let them 
stay with t he kids, so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then the y 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

85
 
took awa y t he children. And 
the mothers were devastated. And
 especiall y now at Œ 
at six, seven o'clock, when the people start ret urning from Œ from work, and when 

they found out thi s news, it was such a outcry. It was such a tremendous outcry t hat 
Œ that ev Œ everybody was crying and everybody was Œ was Œ was devastated. It was 
something that some people throw themse Œ t hrew themself on the Œ on the barbed 
wire, you know, to Œ to Œ to see whether the y just can just get out  and Œ and Œ and Œ 

and do something. And people Œ really, the mothers didn™
t 
Œ didn™t 
care
 Œ care for 
their life anymore. They Œ  they Œ they just wanted to joi n them, to be together wi th 
their Œ with their children. And the police officers Œ the wa y we Œ we found out 

later, they were Œ the y were investi gated, t o find out whether there are some kids 
who were hidden, like we were Œ we hid th
e 
Œ 
m y 
Œ m y cousin, who was really 
about, at that ti me, about three years, three and a half years, ma ybe four years. And 
besides that , they want also to know where Œ because the y had information at that 

time Œ It was already ‚ 44 and the y knew t hat t here we
re many, many,many
,  many
 
freedom fighters who Œ who st Œ his Œ have stil l a communication wit h the ghetto, 

and the y had apparentl y Œ  it was felt that Œ also that the police Œ certain police 

officer have helped some, and sti ll helping some of the Œ of the Œ of the freedom 
fighter. So they wanted to find out, and the y shot quite a number of police officers. 
The y shot this 
Greenberg
(ph) who Œ who Œ who was very instrumental. The y 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

86
 
tortured hi m and shot him,  and he would not divulge, 
and would not giveoutwher
e 
the Œ where the hiding places were. And then the rest of those pol ice officers, the y Œ 
part of them Œ the y returned back Œ 
back
 to the ghetto, became devast ated and found 
also their Œ their chi ldren gone. And the Œ it was really Œ t he Œ the feeling, I mean, 

was Œ that was so bad, you know, that the Œ the whole sit uation created an 

incredible l oss of Œ of hope, you know, when you saw something like this. And this 

was March and it Œ it was already when the Russians have advanced already, 

substantial ly towards Œ  towards the west Œ towards Œ towards Œ they liberated 

already many, many citiesin 
Œ in 
Russia
 and they were Œ t he y were moving 
towards Œ t owards 
Lithuania
. And that was an episode which is Œ which was very, 
very tragic, you know, very Œ 
even difficul
t to Œ to 
describethis. This is
 Œ 

someti mes we are talki ng between ourselves, some survi vors, and Œ and we 

exchange Œ 
exchange views.And the 
Œ the Œ t he question is, between one survivor 
and the other one is, how to make people understand what  we went through. I mean, 

this is Œ I mean, it™ s Œ it ™s Œ you see, you are li mited in Œ in Œ in Œ in being able to 
understand it when Œ when somebody tell s you something, you know, that™s Œ 

because their  Œ our Œ  our minds are Œ are i n a certain way li mited. We cannot 
understand be yond this limit, you know. And i t is, how can somebody describe 
certain things that like? How can somebody describe that a German
 
SS
 man takes a 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

87
 
child of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes hi m with his head against Œ 
against a wall? I mean, how can Œ 
I mean, t his is
 Œ it Œ it™ s Œ it™s not even Œ even i n 

the most
 
su
bstandard countries, I mean, it™s happening, you know. They Œ they ki ll 
people, 
the y massacre people,but 
Œ but I don™t think it™s only Œ I mean, it™s Œ and 

it™s hard to describe and it™s hard to believe. Sometimes I m yself, it™s hard for me to 

believe that Œ that Œ it l ooks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly 

happened, you know. An-And Œ and time was going so slow, you know. The Œ t he Œ 

the Œ the worst part  is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of Œ I 

didn™t even mention some other work that I used to do, you know. They took us to 

the Œ to the army barracks in Œ someti mes and we had to clean out latrines and 
something else
, you know, the
y 
Œ and some Œ someti mes the y took some people and 
the y just threw them into the latrine, I know, just only to Œ to have a l ittle pastime 
for themselves, you know. So I mean, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s be yond Œ be yond description. 

So that™s Œ so that ™s one of the reasons why we meet toget her with survivors 

someti mes
, and we share experiences, we Œ 
we 
Œ we can understand i t much better 
than Œ than Œ than explaining that to the outer world, you know, it™s Œ it Œ and it™ s 

very hard to believe that a country so advanced, you know, was Œ was get Œ getting 
children and then 
[indeciphera ble]
 and all  thi s. That were Œ that 
were able 
Œ 
that wer Œ came down t o a level, to such a l evel, to Œ to Œ to be so dest ructive and so

without hearts, wit hout Œ so the g hetto was Œ 
th
-this 
was a
 Œ at that Œ at that stage , it 
was already a camp, yeah. Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot 
keep
 our Œ m y uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daught er there. So we 
made contact through a Œ there was a rabbi™s wife, 
Shuma n
(ph) was her name. And 
I™m sure that she Œ she is going to surface in some of your Œ some of the 
places. She 

was 
a 
Œ an incredibl e lady. She was a rabbi ™
s wife. Herhusband was in 
Israel
 Œ in 
Palestine
 al ready. And she Œ some wa y he left before that. And she was 

mat chmaki ng. She was out Œ without the Œ wit hout the Œ the stars. She was going 

around and finding places to harbor children. So some Œ 
some
body t old us about her 
and we were in Œ contacted her, and Œ and she found a place for 
Sulami
(ph), which 
was my
 Œ 
my
 Œ m y cousin. She was three and a half, or four years old at that ti me. 
My 
Œ 
m y 
aunt laughs always, she sa ys that I Œ  I Œ I used t o have an incredible 
appetite, you know. And I used to watch, you know Œ she used t o give her Œ 

someti mes we were abl e to smuggle in tapioca. You know what is? It™s a Œ and I 

used to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she shoul d not eat the tapioca so i t 

would be left over for me to eat. So she al wa ys Œ so we decided to do Œ how would 

Œ we woul d do that. At that time, we had t wo 
SS
 people in the ghetto. One name 
was 
Fiffiger
(ph) and the other name was Œ what was the other name? It will come 
to me pre
tty soon. Yeah,it™s 
[indecipherable]
 
Fiffiger
(ph) 
was a former teacher 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

and he was Œ very much befriended my uncle. He was v
ery nice. He was
 
a 
SS
, a
nd 
he told the story that he was forced into the 
SS
. And he Œ he expressed very good 
sentiments. So my uncl e had to put  his confidence Œ he showed in Œ in few cases, he 
showed that he was Œ he was helpful. And we could see that he i
s not oneof
 these Œ 
one of these beasts, you know. So m y uncle explained to hi m and Œ and he knew 
that we are having t he child there, and Œ against all odds, and he promi sed m y uncle 

that he is going to help hi m out. This was a remarkable Œ but his comrade, his 

friend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite. Just the opposite. What he did 

once was al so be yond Œ he encouraged people Œ he opened up the Œ he opened up 

th-this Œ 
anywa y,  
first, let me finish with 
Fiffi ger
(ph). So the y arranged that the Œ 
th
e 
Œ the bread was comi ng in twice a week with these big platforms, and then the 

horses wit h a driver were going out. So we arranged to Œ I gave her the sleeping 

pill. We put her in a bag because the y Œ it used to come i n bags. So we put her in 

one of the bags. And we put her under a bi g Œ so they Œ she can go through the Œ 

through the gates. Because the gates, the y always used to stick somet hing to find 

where there™s sometim es hide. But it was already prearranged, you know, that 

apparently he Œ he Œ he did that Œ 
Fiffiger
(ph) did that, you know. And we were 
able to get her out and she was given away to Œ to a very nice Lithuanian family. 

The y took care Œ the y even baptized her and made her like a part of the Œ and she 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

spoke only Lithuanian and she was Œ she fortunately survi ved. In exchange, m y 
uncle Œ the police officer who was shot, his lit tle boy was also given out to 

somebody. But he was betra yed and they ki lled hi m. Apparently, this Lithuanian 
that took him was given Œ were given certai n t hings in order to do that. They 
betrayed him and he was Œ and we found out l ater that he was Œ he was killed. So Œ 

Q: Do you want to take a break now, or Œ 

A: Let me j ust finish with the Œ it will come back, the name of the ot her guy
, you 
know. He was a bad, bad Œ I should have writ ten down. Yeah, so he Œ what he Œ  he 

formed Œ it was already March, April Œ i
t was already
 Œ the g
hetto alrea
dy knew 
that it™s Œ i t™s Œ it™ s still  a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
little bi t of hope on the horizon. So he let out 
the word that he is going to Œ that he is going to let out some people to escape. And 
he opened up a Œ a hole in Œ was i n the fence. And needless to sa y, he was with a 

machine gun there, and he killed like 14 peopl e there, clai ming that t hey tried to 

escape. So t hat was 
SS
. 
Sturmführer
. 
[b

Q: Another thing I think I asked you before Œ why don™
t we
 Œ  

A: You want I should t ell also about the escape, or Œ  

Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me a little bit about the ghetto becoming an official 
concentration camp.  
A: 
We
ll, towards t he end of the 1943, 
we s
 Œ we saw certain movem ents in a

different direction
. We
 Œ we felt that there is some kind of changes going to be 
implemented in the ghetto. And we really didn™t Œ didn™t know exactl y. We felt that 

the guards were changed. We have Œ 
we have 
seen more
 Œ that was al so a time 
when we ha ve seen more Hungarians. They brought in Hungarians, and especially 

sometruck drivers. One 
Œ one of them, 
which Iknewpretty well, he was
 
a 
v ery 
bad 
mouth, and Œ but he was not Œ not so bad. But the rest were very bad. He was 

Ha ymushi
(ph). H
e was a Hungari an truck dri ver who Œ who worked very close 
with Œ wit h 
Pilgrim
(ph) and Œ and 
Fiffiger
(ph). He was, like, alwa ys with them. 
And we felt that by bri nging in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more 

restrictions, and Œ and start Œ the y started also watching more of the Œ all the 
movements and what™s going 
on, what™
s happening in the ghetto. And they were 
very much concerned and very much were Œ 
were 
looking for Œ for some kind of 

supplies that the ghetto would supply, or the ghetto woul d produce, or the ghetto 

would have some contacts with Œ with the Œ wi th the freedom fighters. So in order 

to have a ti ghter watch, they Œ they have also t ried to squeeze out from the police 
and see whether their police Œ to find within the police also some people who 

would Œ who would be on Œ on their side. They were not Œ were not t oo much able 
to Œ they had not been able to get from the Œ from the Jewish police, except in Œ in 
isolated 
case
 Œ 
case
s, because the police was well aware of what Œ what was

happening. And the y Œ they themselves Œ t he ghetto was t he Œ with the council in

blowing up railroads, and sh Œ cutting off supplies, and Œ and sh ooti ng in many 
cases, in back of the Œ of the Œ of the Germans. Although the Germans themselves, 
like Œ the Germans themselves, they Œ they Œ most of the time didn™t dare to invade 

the forest, because the forest was for them, taboo. But they used for that purpose, 

they used Lithuanians, in many cases, to Œ to find out and to find out t he right spots 

and then the y woul d Œ t
hey would 
be able t o Œ to move in. We also saw the Œ not 
o n ly by 
Œ 
by 
the change of the guard and by t heir behavior, we Œ we have felt 
a 
bigger presence in t he ghetto of Œ of  the military. Because normal ly, in all those 

years, the y were Œ they were, most  of the times, guar-guarding the ghetto from t he 
outside and they were hardly Œ not too frequently, the y Œ they used t o come in and Œ 

and Œ and l ook for themselves, look in i n certain aspects of the ghett o. Now, in the 

late ‚43, we have Œ we had a Œ 
a 
much bigger presence. There were also a repetition 
of Œ of people that Œ of requirement s for Œ for labor force in some other Œ other 
places withi n

council in order to provide them with Œ wi th Œ with those elements who can be 
useful for them. And most of the times, they Œ they Œ some of the ti mes the y also 

tried to get some people who Œ who had some skills, and tried to use them in the 
best of their Œ their abil it y. We have seen al so that factories, in the Œ t he 
verstattin
(ph) have been over swamped with Œ with additional work. As the front 
was getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to Œ for Œ f or 

Œ for the Germans, for t heir supplies, and t he y needed the Œ the hel p and th
e 
Œ and 

the cooperati on of this 
verstattin
(ph), so they used to work overtime. I mean, 
instead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know. And the y al so 

implemented some shifts in that time. The Œ the underground movement grew faster 
and faster. The y Œ 
t h e y 
had now much bett er opportunities because the Lithuanians 
by themselves also were not dumb. The y saw t hat the tide is changing. So the y, in 
many cases, they tried to befriend, and Œ and t o be a 
little bit morehelpful. 

Although, the 
Œ the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody t
hat the y 
would have a

. But we have seen that the y Œ they 
were more 
aggressive in Œ in hiding people and in helping and Œ and in trying to make up for 
the Œ for the damages that they have done before. When t he Œ in 1944, after the Œ 
after the children™s 
aktion

out our
 Œ 
m y 
cousin from Œ from the ghetto, I m yself started

away. I was in contact in two cases, in two ca Œ  
Q: I have to ask you to say that again because of the airplane. What  are you going to 

tell me about now? Are you going to tell me about your escape?  
A: 
Mm
-hm. The guards, and Œ and more frequently coming into the Œ to the Œ to the 
ghetto. I didn't see, reall y a Œ I mean, the y were as brutal as the y used to be because 
this Œ especially the Œ t he Œ the foreigners Œ the Hungarians, the y were not Œ the y 

were not good people
, y
ou know that Œ 
especiall y
 there. They were Œ they were as 
brutal as the y are, maybe some Œ 
some 
Œ some more than Œ than the others in Œ in 
many,
 many occasions. This 
[indecipherable]
 the truck driver, 
I mean, 
he 
was 
[indecipherable]
 t hat time when I Œ 
I me
ntioned about letti ng Œ deceiving t he 
people and telling them the y can escape and so forth and so on, because people have 

started feeling there, the air has changed, in the sense that the front was getting 

closer and cl oser. And the question was when and how fast. At the same ti me, the y 

started getti ng preparat ions for Œ for Œ to liquidate the ghetto. Apparently this was 

mentioned in
 Œ in a Œ in few occasions that Œ t hat pretty soon the y have already 

orders in pl ace in order to eli minate the ghetto, and to Œ and to take out all those 

remains of the Œ of the people. At t hat ti me, I t hink Œ I™
m 
Œ 
I™m 
sure t hat in the 
ghetto were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now Œ 
ma ybe now 
from 33,000 that originally Œ so what they did is also Œ when Œ w hen t hey Œ when

they used t o Œ when the ghetto became smaller Œ 
small
-smaller in Œ i n Œ in 
population , they al so st art cutting off smaller i n territory
. Wha
t the y did is, where 
we had the 
Varniu
(ph) 
 where the Œ wit h the Œ wit h the 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 was 
the gate for the supplies, t
here was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
number of houses that one day the y 
came in and they took a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
bunch of people, workers, and they di dn't remove 

the fence that was the original fence. What t hey did is, they put i n another fence, 

cutting off, like, four or five blocks from t he Œ from the original one. So it became 

like a ghett o within a ghetto, you know. This was, in a certain way, t o m y personal 

advantage, you know, because Œ 
and m
a ybe some others, which I Œ 
I 
Œ I do Œ I don™t 
know. I can speak for m yself on it. What the y did is, actually by Œ 
by 
putting a new 
fence and putting guards Œ putting guards around this fence, the y have di minished 
the guards from the overall fence, which w
as before
, even without taking off. So, 

what happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided Œ I have a Œ 
had a 

Œ we were five Œ five people that we decided t o Œ to 
flee the camp. We saw
 that Œ  
already that the ti me is running out. I spoke to Œ three ti mes to one friend of mine 

that was in the Œ was in the Œ in the partisans. And he tol d me that whenever I want 

to join them I should Œ I should contact somebody, and Œ in order to join them. The 
only thing is, after that I tried to get the Œ t he other Œ th-the contact man and he was 
already gone , also. So I went to 
m y 
Œ where my uncle was and I told hi m, l
ook, I

think that i t™s no Œ  no reason for me to remain here. I mean , it™s Œ we™re Œ we™re 
close. We™
re very close to the end. I mean, it™s Œ the y are going Œ one of these days, 

we are going to get up and we™re going to find ourselves surrounded by Œ 
by
 trucks 
and the y are Œ they are just going to take us, and Œ and Œ and ta-take us out and Œ 

and take us to camps, or take us somewhere else, or Œ or Œ or take us t o the 
Ninth 

Fort
. So m y uncle, who was very conservative alwa ys Œ and he really was very 

close to me, was Œ was like Œ like a father to me, you know. And th-this was ma ybe 
one of reasons that Œ that I have not  left the place sooner. And especia
ll y m y 

grandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she 
[indeciphera bl e]
 that ti me 
when I saved her
, you know
, she Œ she 
would not
 Œ and we knew that she Œ she Œ 
also Œ also survived, you know, the Œ the children™s 
aktion 
that 
time 
also when Œ 
b
ecause sh
e was with a child insi de, but her, we couldn™t get Œ get her out, 
because 
well, it would be t oo Œ too difficult, you know. A child is somet hing t hat Œ 
el
-else. 
So  
what Œ so 
m y uncle cametothe conclusion
, sa y that™s fine and gave me his 
blessing, I mean, it  Œ and I deciding to Œ now, how are we going to do it? So I Œ I 

devised a pl an, in other word, the houses which were behind the first Œ the general  

fence, a few h
ouses stil l left. They have Œ n ormal ly, in many cases they would 
explode some of the houses. The y would put i n some dynamite and explode it. 

Here, the y Œ they have Œ and Œ and the y di d it later on wit h the r Œ  wit h the Œ wit h

the rest of the ghett o. So I had a Œ I had three more people with me Œ three Œ four. 
There was one Œ one guy that was hi mself from 
Poland
 and for Œ 
some way
 
he was 
stuck in Œ i n Œ in 
Kovno
,
 
and never was able t o get out. And then it was the nephew 
of  Œ the nephew of m y aunt, who is now i n 
Charlotte
, 
North
 
Carolina
. And then 

the other one was a guy that used to Œ 
fr
equently to come to our house. And then it 
was the other fellow that worked also with Œ was a nephew of somebody who 

worked wit h m y Œ with my 
uncle. So
, then this guy knew Œ supposedl y he knew the 
road, how t o Œ I mean, where to go in order to get to the forest.  

Q: You know what Œ 

A: The forest was Œ what Œ yeah, oka y. 
Q: Œ I have to stop you, sir. The reason is, I thi nk that people Œ  

A: Oka y. I'll make that sh-short, you know. Okay. We were five, we have 

accumulated some supplies in one of the houses. And one da y when we came back 

from work, we have Œ we Œ we just defected from the Œ 
from 
Œ from the group, 

which was large group, when we came back from work. And we went  into this 

house and t hen we wat ched the out  guard Œ the outside guard Œ 
we
 had also special 
pliers to cut Œ to cut the wire. We have Œ wai t t il the night . On that third day, we 
cut through Œ in our supplies what  we had was water, sugar, and bread. We Œ we 
watched Œ we timed the guards that was walki ng, we cut t hrough the wires, and we

just came out. And we Œ it was nightti me and we were not  able to go too far because 
night Œ nightti me, it was Œ it was 
a 
Œ it was very dangerous to go, 
because you™
re 
able Œ 
I mean, 
they would stop you and t hen right awa y t here, you would be 
finished. So we hi d in a Œ in 
a 
Œ next to a house in the garden, w
here 
it was dense 

bushes and we stayed there for Œ for a Œ for the night. And then early morning, we 

left and we went towards the woods Œ towards the woods which was 
Janava
. That 
was a Œ 
a place w
h
ere t here were al
 Œ the
re al
ready some partisans were Œ were 
working Œ were working in Œ in the Œ in the Œ i n the exploding some supplies Œ 

some supplies for the Germans and so on. Okay. We had t o go through to a Œ 

through a main highway. And when we walked, we walked like i n one behind the 
other one. So when we reached the highway Œ and this was during the dayti me 
already, a guy with a Œ with a bic ycle and was dressed in Œ in civi lian but with a 

rifle, was there waiting for us. And when we approached hi m, I mean, he took off 

the rifle and he said, your documents. Oka y. We start running in different 

directions. This was outside the city, you know, it was a big field of potatoes and Œ 

and corn. So Œ

that I was able personal ly to Œ personally t o Œ to verify, you know
.  So
 Œ oka y. So 
we Œ we start, and this guy took off his rifle and started shooting one of the five. I 
mean, he hi d and then I found out later that they killed him. Four of us, we 

dispersed and I ran i n one direction to the cornfield. And I saw some Œ it was really 

late during the da y and I Œ I Œ I Œ  

Q: You know something? 
A: Yeah?  
Q: I hate to ask you to do this, but 
I™m

Œ  I'm concerned because this is on

[brea k]
 
A: Towards the beginning of ‚44, we have seen with a Œ with a change also, the 

status of the ghetto Œ from the ghetto to a concentration camp. We felt a new Œ 
a 

new arrangements and Œ and some things Œ certain things Œ certain changes which 
we Œ it was not too hard for us to figure out. We saw that the handwriting on the 
wall. We saw that everything what™s happening with the Russian army, t he 
victorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards Œ towards the Œ towards the

west. And we felt also t hat there is time for Œ for me and for some friends to Œ to get 
out and get out as soon as possible because every Œ 
every 
da y was a matter that Œ 

we knew exactly that Œ what our fate was going to be. So truthfully, we didn't have 
too much t o risk because one wa y or the ot her way, I mean, we woul d Œ we would 
not be able to survi ve. So I went t o see my uncle and I tol d him that Œ 
and m y 
grandmother, I told them that I™
m 
Œ I Œ I™m ready,  with Œ  with m y ot her fellow Œ 
fellow friends to Œ to get out, and to get out 
as 
fast. So m y uncle I Œ 
m y uncle 
al so 
gave me
 
a 
Œ he had l ike a little gol den coin and he gave thi s to me and he said, look, 

in case of necessity or something, I 
mean, you 
Œ he Œ he Œ  he had like three of them, 
you know,  so he was hi ding that always in Œ somewhere. So when Œ soon I got 
together wit h m y Œ wit h 
m y 
friends and when we went to work, comi ng back we 
just evaded the guards and we 
came 
into one of the houses that we marked for Œ for 
our shelter i n Œ in Œ in between, in order to be able to Œ to plan our Œ our 
escape. 

The Œ one of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a 

short one, and we used hi m as the outlook. So he used to look 
and
 to watch. And he 
was the one that ti med the steps of the Œ of the guard on t he outsi de of the fence, 

and then came to the conclusion. He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut 
through the wires and t hat was nightti me. And we just sli pped out, all of us. 
Because we Œ really the security was behind us in the Œ in the smaller ghetto where 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

101
 
there was double-rol led barbed wire. This was all Œ this was a old fence which the y 
have never tried to repair because the y were Œ there was Œ the ghet to was in the 

ghetto, you know. Now, when we had to Œ we slept over t here in a Œ i n a Œ in a 
garden, a dense garden. And in the morning we start going. But we left a distance 
between ourselves. Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one, 

some meters, one behind the other one. When we came through a Œ through a Œ with 

a bo Œ to a place where we had to cross the highway, there was one person with a Œ 

with a bic ycle, and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lit huanian. And suddenly h
e came out 

and approached us, sa y, stop, documents. Raise your hands. So when he did that, we 

start running in different directions. It was onl y one person and we knew that he 
might shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. Besi des t hat, his aim 
was not too good because I felt Œ when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me 

and then I don't  know. I Œ I Œ I rea
lly ranli ke neverin m y life,a
nd then I threw 

m yself in the cornfield. I know also that later on when I was la ying there for quite a 

while, I know that they Œ they 
had s
ome 
Œ some people with horses try t o locate 

somebody,  and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. But I, during 
nighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble Œ flickering lights. 
And I sa y t o m yself, without these Œ would that be headquarter Œ would Œ would 
that be quarters for the Germans or some barracks or something? Then I stepped 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

away and I found myself close to a small, smal l woods. And there I sl ept over the 
night. It was really Œ 
it was
 a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with 

leaves and some ot her things. And there was a little Œ a lit tle Œ I wouldn't say a 
river, but it was litt le place with Œ with water. And then I Œ I was hiding behind t he 
bushes. In the morning, I heard some voices in Russian, and I Œ I watched that, and 

I saw that t here Œ there, a woman came and she Œ apparently two friends, but one 

stayed with a Œ with a metal thing, you know, what they Œ they put here Œ put in 

cloth. And she started washing ri ght there in this Œ where there was 
li
 Œ this was not 
even like a ri ver, but  it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. I had my 

hat, so with my hat I used to take and Œ and Œ and drink t he water. Because food 
was nothing. I Œ I used to collect some Œ some berries, you know, from wild berr ies, 

and this was m y food. So I was desperate. I was very hungry and this woman was 

washing and I said to m yself, 
let me
 Œ 
let me approachher.
 And I spoke perfect 

Russian, of course. So I came out. I said, l ook, I™
m 
Œ 
I™m 
escapee, and like you 
should hel p me wi th some food. So I was not sure whether she was going to go Œ 

f irst of all, I didn™t know. I asked her what was there in this Œ 
in this
 place, 
where I 

saw the flickering li ghts in the night. And she said, no, that™s a camp, a civilian ca-
ca
mp for civilian Russi ans. An intern camp for civilian R ussians. But  then she told 
me that she is going to come back and bring me some food. And I Œ I thought to 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

103
 
m yself, I prayed, I said, or she is going t o bring me food, or she i s goi ng to bring me 
a 
German who is going to Œ to 
kil l me?
 About 15 minutes later she comes back with 
a bottle of milk and a piece of 
spec
(ph)
 
Œ you know, that™ s Œ that ™s from Œ it™s l ike 
meat, fat meat, you know Œ and a piece of bread. And then I started tal king to her 

and she said to me that she got scared when she saw me, because I l ooked like I™m 

an old, you know, the Œ and I explained to her that I™m a refugee, and so forth. And 

so she said to me, look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who Œ who fled, 

and who are hiding in our Œ in thi s Œ in t his camp. And t he y also are going to Œ they 

are planning to go t o join the Œ the freedom fighters, the partisans. And where the y 

are going?  The y are going to 
Janava
, 
Janava
, 
Belder
(ph), that used t o be 
Janava
, 
the forest of 
Janava
, which was not too far away from there. And t his guy 
Scheiker
(ph),that was with me,he 
Œ he Œ he was leaving us, and he told us, and he 
explained t o me, because he hi mself was from 
Janava
, and he told us Œ he gave me 

certain Œ certain param eters. But now, I mean, he was Œ he was gone, so I had to do 

that m yself. So then, in the Œ in the evening, sh-sh Œ the t wo Russians came over. 

The y had knives for themselves, and they asked me a few questions, and they 

wanted to verify whether I am legit and I shouldn™t be Œ 
I sho
uldn't be some Œ the 
b ay 
Œ 
betray them
. And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went 
to the 
woods, we approached them, and one of them had apparently a contact, or he knew 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

104
 
exactly a cert ain spot . First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very 
friendl y by the Russians, because 
Stalin™s
 Œ 
Stalin™s
 view was that the Russian
s 
should never fell in 
a 
prisoner life, 
I mean, 
he should give his life for the country. 
But of course, this Œ that was not t he case. So he took us to the forms Œ f orest at one 
point and he Œ then we met  about three or four more guys there. The y were from 

the Œ from Œ apparently also, the y were former Russian prisoners. And the y had 

already a plan, a top Œ t opographic plan, and they had all rolls. So they said that 

they have received some supplies from Œ 
from 
parachutes t hat the y Œ and they had 
some assignment t o watch and to see whet her some German forces are going Œ i
f 

they are going to be close by, they have to communicate and the y have to try to do 
certain sabot age Œ sabotage work. We spent about, I would sa y, ma ybe about close 
to 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one, because we didn™t want  to 

stay in one spot. And on few occasions Œ I was not trained, I didn™t Œ I didn™t know 

anyt hing about Œ about ammunition or anyt hing. The y have done, basically, the 

work. And the Œ in Œ in  different cases, I was t he look out. They used me to be the 

look out. The y had some Œ 
some
 light arms and knives basically, and the y had some 
back packs with Œ with ammuniti on. We spent, I would sa y, about four weeks. And 
one Œ one da y, we heard a 
movement. We put ourears
 Œ normally, what we used to 
do is, we used to put our ears to the grounds, 
so we can detect
 Œ t hat™s a way of 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

105
 
detect
 whether there i s some heavy movements. And here we detected that 
some
 Œ 
based on our i magi nations, some tanks. And now we saw about t hree or four 
German tanks rolli ng not too far away, you know. And t hen about a couple hours 
later, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. And this whole 
neighborhood vicinity became like a Œ like a Œ like a milit ary, I mean, hell. Because 

bullets and 
flying out 
t he Œ in 
the shrubs, and 
saw burning Œ burning bushes and all 
this, you know. It was an incredible, incredi ble exchange of fire. Then, it lasted for 

about an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you 

know. Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, n
ow we 

are going to be killed by Œ  
by 
friendly Œ by friendly Œ our friendly power Œ gun 
power. Suddenly, it qui etened down. It was quiet like not hing Œ I mean, like Œ li ke 
nothing ever Œ anyt hing happened, you know. And I sa y to the Œ to one of Russians, 

I sa y, what Œ what would that be? I mean it™s Œ it™s too quiet, I mean, we got used 

already to the Œ to t he Œ to the Œ to the incredible sound of Œ of Œ of 
explosions, you 

know. And then suddenl y we heard again, we put Œ 
the R
ussian put his Œ he put his 

ear on the ground. He said, something is happening. It™s Œ it™s quite apparent
ly,
 but 
something is happening. And, like 45 mi nutes later, we heard Œ 
we heard 
some 
movement of, like, troops. Not too many. And then we saw the first Russians 

approaching us. And the first question was Œ t he first question was, have you seen 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

106
 
some tanks? I sort of
, y
eah, we saw  quite a few hours ago. And he said, no, these 
tanks already finished. Have you seen some other tanks? And we say, no. Right 
away it was Œ I was  amazed, you know, because right awa y I Œ I 
was approached by 
Œ 
by 
one of the lieutenants. I think it 
was a capt
ain, not 
a 
lieut
enant
 Œ captain, 
because he had three st ars, yeah. It was a capt ain, and he Œ he 
actuall y t old me 

that Œ he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? I say yes. 
So  am 

I, he said. Okay, we embraced each other and he Œ right away what he did is, he told 

us Œ he sai d, look, this i s the front line, and the line might  change, because we don™t 

know what  Œ what Œ what Œ what i s ha Œ what  can Œ 
what is 
going to happen a few 
kilometers from here. My advice i s, and what  I want to see you, i s to the

, you know, towards t he back, you 
know. And right awa y, he called a Œ 
a

take them over. And Œ and in 
meanti me, w

and some Œ 
some

t hiswas actually the 
Œ t he Œ the wa y that we Œ so 
happy. I mean, the first time we felt like Œ

do is, I want to go Œ I want to see Œ 
because m y questionwas, how soonarethey 
going to liberate 
K aunas
? He said, that might take still a few da ys or Œ or it might 

still take some Œ some time. So we were wi th t he army for about Œ I think about ten 
or 15 da ys til the y have to

K a una s
 and to liberate it. I went right 
away to the Œ to the Œ t o the ghetto. The ghetto was expl oded. Everyt hing, all the 
houses were exploded. The y have Œ 
some 
people came out from the hiding in some 
places. Some peopl e came out from hiding. I went to this place where we were 

hiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. But suppl ies 

and other things that we had in Œ in our Œ in our house, and in the ground was 

nothing. It was like, everyt hing burned. And right awa y I went to Œ to 
Kaunas
. This 
was 
Slo bodka
. I went to 
Ka unas
, I got m yself Œ right 
away I met wit hthisofficer, 
that he told me that  he i s going to Œ he is Œ 
I mean, 
that he is going to be coming to 
Kaunas
, and he gave me a number wher
e I can 
Œ I can reach hi m. And he told me 
that if I have some Œ some kind of desire of some Œ 
some
t hing. I said, yeah, I would 
like to have  Œ I have some Œ I have some relatives here, and I woul d li ke to see 

whether I can find them. 
Where 
Œ where are there Œ I Œ I am sure Œ 
I felt
 they were 
very optimistic. I said ma ybe there are some relatives that  I have. And I start 
floundering around for quite a few da ys. And t hen I found a family,  that we were 
together in the ghett o and then later, they went to Canada. But I used t o send them

packages when I was in there Œ when Œ just a mi nute Œ that I send them packages 
after, when I Œ when I Œ when I was in the army. They Œ  I helped them to find a 

place Œ a living place because the Œ the 
city was
 Œ was 
devastated, you
 know. There 
Œ there 
was nottoo many
 Œ too bi g fights in the city, but i t was many have escaped 
and left behind themselves apart ments wit h furniture, and you know, l ike Œ the 

same way li ke when the Œ when the Œ when the Germans came in. So right awa y I 

fo
und a Œ 
a 
friend of mine, who told me t hat if I would like to serve Œ  to serve in the 
Œ in the Russian arm y because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, and I 

speak the Œ I speak Lit huanian, German, and Œ 
an
-and Russian, so I would be a 
good prospect. He se Œ he told me that there is coming a Œ 
a 
group of Œ a Œ a group 
of people to Œ of military men to take some Œ 
to
 take Œ to Œ to Œ t he y are looking for 
some
 inper Œ interpreter. The y need very badl y people who speak Lit huanian and 
Russian. Basi
cally German is not, at this point , is not i mportant, but it™s going to 
become i mportant later. And at the same time, the y promulgated a law that all t hese 

people from this and this year, the y are going t o be Œ the y are going to be from 

1924, 1925, 1926, the y are going t o be taken t o the arm y Œ to the regular arm y. And 

I sa y to m yself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than Œ than to wait and then 
be recruited t o the arm y. The y have like a place where the y called 
wayan

a 
Œ 
a

check out prospecti ve soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have 
TB
 
because there were many with Œ with 
TB
, you know, from those that survived. So I 
actually signed up for t his Œ for this unit. I remember a younger capt ain came in 
and Œ and i nterviewed me and he was satisfied. And then what he tol d me that he is 
going to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation Œ military 
preparation of about six weeks. And I agreed. In 
meant
i me, he tol d me I can Œ 
I can 
stay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a Œ 
a 
Œ a 

apartment. So I found m y relatives, those I mentioned, and I found myself not too 

far away where I used t o live before, on the sa
me
 
[indeci phe
rable] 
on same main 
street. I got myself a ni ce apartment and m y relatives were very happy. The y had 
two children and Œ and m yself and I told t hem, look, I a
m goin
g t o be just here, and 
only temporary, and I a
m 
Œ 
I am 
going to be leaving. And also, 
was ver
y interesti ng 
walking on the Œ when I got m yself a bic ycle an-and riding on the bike, I met a very 
good friend of mine, this 
Harmutz
(ph), who was the Œ t he head of th
e 
ORT
. He 

wasn™t in the ghetto and he was involved in the partisans. And he esca Œ I 
mean,
 he 
joined in also in 
thearmy butin thecivil iandepart ment. The y made hi m
 
a 
Œ like a 
commissar, or somethi ng, in the civilian department because he Œ he had excellent 
contacts in the Œ wi th some high-ranking people. So I met  with him and it was 
incredible, i ncredible meeting, you know, to Œ in Œ in middle of Œ of Œ of nowhere

or something like, 
you know, 
in t he middle of the city, to meet somebody that was 
such a close friend of mi ne. Then, from there, I Œ I was Œ I was sent to a Œ to a Œ to a 
training camp, and i n about six weeks the y send me to t he first missi on. 
I mean, 
I 
was recruited, got t he uniform, got m y Œ t he y sent me wit hin 
Lithuania
, in certain 
places to Œ 
to
 be attached to the Œ there was al so Œ you see, there was also a 
Lithuanian brigade un
der the Commander 
Vili nski
(ph), who was Œ which was 
formed right when the war Œ in the beginning of the war. Very brave. Many of those 

people died in Œ 
in deep 
Russia
,  you know, 
an
d it was i ncredible , reall y. But I 
didn™t Œ I joined the regular ar-
ar
my, wh
ich I Œ I said that  is a policing force, which 
is called the  Œ it was the 33rd regi ment of the 
[indecipherable]
 
NKVD
, which was 
the border police, att ached to the 
NKVD
. After the training and after the y send me 
to 
Lithuania
, the y send me to a place, to 
Lie

, which was 
Courland
, in Œ that 
was in 
Latvia
. And there Œ there we had big  Œ a big fight because 
there were 
Œ there 
were the Œ I don't know whether you heard about the 
Vlasovtsy
. That is a General 
Vlasov
, a Ukrainian who joined the Germans and he created a Ukrainian Œ 

Ukrainian battalion. Alway Œ almost the arm y,  who fought with the Germans 

against the Russians, against their own people. So there were entrenched the Œ 
a 
group of Œ of those people, and they fought tooth and nai l because they knew that i
f 
they are going to be captured, the y are goi ng t o be killed 
[indeci phera ble]
. The y

wouldn't take them as prisoners. And there I had m y Œ m y first accident. I was in 
a 
Jeep
 with a Œ with a captain, and Œ and a driver, and there was a bi g shelling, and it 
hit the 
Jeep
, and I was just knocked out fro-from the 
Jeep
, and I found m yself later 
in the hospital. Thanks God I had only two broken ribs and Œ and 
small
 Œ small 
contusions and some Œ 
some
 
other things, you know
. But  the capt ain who was 
sitting next to me was killed, a R ussian captain. And then from there, I Œ they sent 
me after I Œ took me about 14, 15 days to Œ to be back on m y feet Œ t
hey 
Œ they send 
me to 
Germany
, was t o ca Œ and participate i n Œ in liberating the Cit y of 
Königsburg
, which was very interesting. And from there, t he y came a order to Œ 

after a while, came an order Œ a special order, that our regi ment was going to be 
sent entirely to the 
[indecipherabl e]
 Islands, t o the Japanese front. And I was the 
only one that got t he assignment t o join 
Chuikov™s
 arm y i n the di recti on of 
Berlin
. 
And this was Œ and I feel that this was because the Œ the colonel that was in charge,
 

Venakuro v
(ph), I think it was, Jewish. And I Œ I told hi m once, I said, look Œ I 
pleaded wit h him, I tol d hi m, look, I Œ 
if you
 are going to send me to the 

[indecipherable]
 Islands, I am going to be of no use, and I am in the mood
, you 

know, to Œ  to take vengeance for Œ for my people, and I Œ I 
think my place
 wil Œ 
should be on the German front rather th
an on the 
Œ on the Japanese front. So next 
day, I Œ I found a Œ 
a 
Œ it™s called

(ph). T
hat means my

assignment to travel. And this is when I travel ed through 
Warsaw
. I remember 
traveling through 
Warsaw
 bridge, it took us maybe an hour to pass this bridge, 
because t
he bridge was completely damaged and the train was going slowly through 
that. And then there I j oined the Œ I joined 
Chuikov™s
 forces. And this was 
incredible experience, i ncredible experience. T hen we marched, I mean we went Œ 

when we Œ we conti nued to Berlin and we also liberated a concentrat ion camp of 

Sa chsenha usen
. And we had in our Œ 
in our power, mostofthe
 Œ of the guards 
from the concentrati on camp of 
Sa chsenha usen
. Now the Œ  
Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you saw when you got to 
Sa chsen
hausen
.  
A: What we saw was Œ was Œ was terrible, t errible things. I mean t he Œ 
the face of 
the Œ there were few people Œ I mean, not t oo many people. I would say a few 
hundred people. Ma ybe it were Œ maybe more than 
that, ma ybe
 around thousand 

people that were Œ 
were 
liberated. Most of th
em wefound many, many, 
ravines 
with Œ wit h human bodies, you know, skeletons. And Œ and it was Œ it  was 
a 

terrible, 
a 
terrible, terrible view, you know, to see that, see what actuall y Œ there 
were Œ and t his Œ in 
Sachsenhausen
, there were not only Jews, t here were also 

many, many from other different nationalities. There were Russian prisoners, there 
were Œ 
there were 
Pola
ks
, and there were some not Œ non-Jewish people also. We 
have Œ we were successful because the y Œ they actually Œ  they wanted to Œ the Œ the 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

113
 
guards actually threw away their weapons, and they wanted to Œ the y Œ they actually 
surrendered. The Œ the fight was Œ it was not a big fight because t he y Œ they felt that 

Œ that it™s over and although there were 
SS
, they were pure 
SS
. They were not the 
W ehrma cht
. And they were all apprehended, most of them. The Œ the head of the 
camp, I mean, the Œ the commander of the camp and Œ and the Œ t he more i mportant 

people were Œ they Œ they escaped. We would spend there a short ti me. There was 
also a very big stench, you know, because there was Œ thi s camp was Œ was dev-

devastated, you know. The y have committed so many atrocities, apparently they 

wanted to move the people, to move out Œ to move out a little bi t further, 
becau
se , 
you know,  
Sa chsenhausen
 is not far from 
Berlin
. It's like 50 kilometers from 
Berlin. The y Œ  

Q: We™re going to change the tape? No.  
A: So the y Œ they 
have decided
, and it was a Œ 
a 
captain that was Œ dec-decided that 
they, rather than Œ t he y rather surrender than Œ than Œ than keep up fighting. The Œ 
the 
people were
 Œ I mean, the y were like, stunned when we came i n. The y Œ the y Œ 

they didn't know. They Œ the y thought we were angels. We were Œ we were Œ we 

came down from heaven, you know. Th
e y 
Œ 
they 
Œ they have never, never believed 
that they are going t o be able to survive, you know, because the y Œ because the y 

were Œ that was a German camp. It was not Œ there are many Germans, also,

German Jews. It was a swift liberation on this Œ this camp was remarkable. And 
then, through the guards, we found out many, many, many details in their Œ 
I mean, 

in Œ in questioning them. We brought them to Œ those people, we brought them to 
our Œ to our headquarters. 
Q: Now I know we have to change Œ  

A: Yeah.

A: Œ everything what they have left behind them. So they Œ I remember that, yeah. 
That is the Œ 
Q: 
[indeci pherable]
 and that™s when the y 
[indecipherable]
 that miraculous escape. 
A number of people act ually Œ 
yo u 
Œ 
you were talkin
g about this earlier, weren™t 
you?
 
A: About t he escape from Œ 
Q: From t he 
Ninth Fort
. And one other question; were you Œ when you went back 

to 
Kovno
, were you wi th the Red Army at  that point? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: So you were part of the Red Army that liberated 
Kovno
.  
A: I was not part of the arm y. I was with the arm y, but I was stil l not Œ I was still 

not a Œ a soldier. I was still Œ 

Q: But you went in when the y liberated 
Kovno
? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But I Œ I Œ 
Q: I™ll let you finish where you were before.

Q: I™m sorry 
[indecipherable]
 
lean back.
 
A: Yeah, we were successful and Œ in gett ing most of the guards with us. Of course, 
I wouldn™t sa y all of them, but most. And we held them i n 
[in
decipherable]
 which 
was east Œ in east 
Berli n
, in 
ern
(ph) 
Schnell
strasse
, for the purposes of a 
investigati on. At that ti me, the col onel that was the head of m y superior officer, he 

wanted to make a small  process, similar to the 
Nuremberg  
process. And that was 
one of the reasons why we went twice to 
Nuremberg
, before consult ations. But  
then I Œ trut hfull y, I don™t know what happened afterwards, you know, because he 

was called to Œ he was called to 
Moscow
, to meet with 
Molotov
, for a certain Œ for 
Œ for certain reasons, and fortunately for me, I Œ I was not able to see hi m when he 
came back, because I was not in the Russian arm y any more when Œ when he came 
back. Now, during the i nvestigations, we have Œ we have had Œ 
very spontaneously 

the y Œ the guards have cooperated. They gave us many details, and they gave us as 

much information as they Œ as the y were abl e t o. And there was a case within thi s 

investigati on, where we had a lieutenant that broke down, because the investigation, 

we used to Œ the Œ we used to conduct them between one and four o™clock in the 
morning. And this was Œ precisely t his was done in this fashion, because that was 
the Œ the way the Œ the 
KGB
, and the 
NK VD 
used to Œ used to conduct themselves, 
because the y feel that  i n this they™re under Œ under Œ under Œ in Œ in a  silent

ambience, and with Œ with Œ wit h some heavy li ghts focused on the Œ on the Œ on 
the prisoner, and the heavy questioning, t
h e y 
Œ they had no choice but  the y had to Œ 
to spill out all the informat ion that the y had. So we had this case with the lieutenant 
who Œ who broke down, and he jumped through Œ broke t he window, jumped down 
and Œ and fell on top of a picket fence. And we thought that he Œ he wanted to 

commit suicide, you know, but fortunately for hi m, he Œ he survived, and he was 

able then later to compl ete Œ complete the investigation and give us the additional  

information that we were looking for. I mean, especially so longer it was, we were 

preparing for a process, we needed more exact information about t h-the conditions, 

and about t he brutal ities they have committed, and their approach to t he Œ to the 
prisoners with their Œ t heir food rationing, their Œ their Œ the Œ the composition of 
the Œ of the people i n the Œ in the Œ in the Œ in the camp, and the Œ and so many 
details that were Œ everything were Œ we had Œ everything was wri tten down, and Œ 

and ready, al most, for a Œ for 
a 
process.  

Q: Oka y, you were Œ you went to 
Berlin
. You were part of the li Œ the liberating 
force of 
Berlin
, were you not? 

A: Yes, we Œ we Œ we were part of the liber Œ b
ecame about 
SS
 Œ  as you know, the 
Berlin
 was the last  stronghold of 
Hitler
 and his Œ and his followers. He, of course, 

went with her, and now he Œ I mean the Œ he™s so ready that it™s Œ it™s over, it™s

finished. The 1,000 year 
R
eich
 is coming to the end. And he gathered, of course, his 
mai n advisors, and they Œ  they have apparentl y decided to Œ to throw the last Œ t he 

last 
kampf
. Not 
mein kampf
, but the last 
kampf
, the last battle, to see Œ the y Œ 
they wanted Œ 
they were very muc
h disappoint ed to fell into the ru Œ i n the Russian 

hands. The y felt much more comfortable if they would have fallen into the French, 

British, or American Œ they Œ 
their desire was to 
Œ to be in the American hands, but 
unfortunately for them, and fortunate
ly 
Œ and unfortunately for some Russians also 

Œ as you know, 
Ei senhower
 stopped to the 
Elbe
, and he gave orders just to stop 
there, not to go ahead. It was a tactical Œ I Œ 
it was 
Œ it was a Œ a good decision in 
one way, and a bad decision in a si Œ in t he other wa y, because this what prompted 
for what happened afterwards, because 
Berlin
 was taken by the Russi ans. The 
Russians were very happy, because to them, you see, the Americans, the y are more 
geared for Œ for individuals. The Russians are more geared f
or masses
. The ind-
individual s don™t count, you know, and the y di dn™t count in the 
Soviet Union
. So 

they fell to Œ to sacrifice 50,000 more of troops couldn™t make a difference, you 

know. 
Eisenhower
 thought in different terms. He thought, let the Russians 
take it. 

Why should we sacrifice our people? And Œ and this was Œ it was a smart decision, 
as I mentioned, in the sense that not Œ not to sacrifice more Œ more 
G
.
I
.s
. 
Q: Right. So you went in. 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

119
 
A: But Œ yeah, so we went in, and th-there Œ 
Berlin
 was taken, as you know, by the 
shtrafniki
. There were a few battalions of th Œ  of Œ of prisoners, and deserters, and 

they were gi ven a opportunity to get in the fight of 
Berlin
, and get amnesty for the 
life Œ I mean, if they Œ i f they survi ve. And this was a tremendo
us battl e, youknow, 

because 
Hitl er
 threw all the Œ all his reserves, and all those who were faithful to 

hi m, especially a Œ a bi g force of 
Hitlerjugend
. That was the Œ 
the young 
Hitler
 
arm y. The battle was over pretty soon. The Œ the resistance was not as strong as the 

Russians had thought it ™s going to be, and the cit y fell. The Russi ans have 

concentrated the 
east Œ east side of 
Berlin
, and we have Œ we Œ we were assigned Œ 
we were coming in, we were assigned to go to the 
Reichs Chancellery
, which was 
the Œ which was the hi deout of 
Hitler
, and hi s followers, his closest followers
.  We 

have found the 
Reichs Chancellery 
with a 
Œ with a bomb, which penetrated 
through the roof, and have never exploded. And the insi de, it was al most everyt hing 

in Œ in pretty Œ pretty good condition, except for the Œ for the big hole that opened 

up from a Œ now, we found also the Œ the bunker of 
Hitler
, which was incredible, 

incredible art work, in t he sense of Œ of Œ of Œ of securit y, providi ng security for Œ 

for a t yrant like Œ li ke 
Hitler
 and his Œ his people. We found doors, steel doors
, 
which like three foot of thickness of the door. We found t he Œ the Œ from 
beto n 
Œ 
from Œ from concrete, about 10 foot of concrete thickness, you know, walls, and Œ

and to the point where we found quite a lot of documents. And basically we had the 
orders, and we found also traces of 
Eva Braun
 and 
Hitler
, which we feel that this 
was their Œ th-their Œ their ashes. That was never confirmed, because t he Russians 
have not Œ were not int erested in, for some reason, to publicize that, and the y have 
cleaned out the place, as soon after we found that. But most of the documents, in the 

documentary, we have turned over to the Œ to t he Americans, who used to come 

with 
Studeba kers
, and take them awa y, because for some Œ 
some 
Œ  
Q: 
[indeci pherable]
 
A: Œ the
y was 
[indecipherable]
 from their archives. What  kind of documents, I 
really don™t know, because I Œ I m yself have not had a Œ 
a chance t o 
Œ had we 
known that there were valuable documents, because the y were Œ the y were in the ru 
Œ the fact that they were in the 
Reichs Chancellery
, and the fact that they were i n 
well Œ well- guarded, and well preserved, was t hat Œ that they are Œ 
they had 
Œ and 
I™m sure that there were Œ the y™re somewhere stashed awa y, or the y™re now still in Œ 

in Œ in separate places i n Œ in 
United States
. Because based what Officer 

Schwa rtz
(ph) told me Œ not officer, he was a sergeant, whom I met and who was 
the one that  used to come with the Œ with the Œ with the trucks, and we used to help 
the Œ our soldiers used to help to pack them. Now, right after that, we Œ

A: The y were Œ the y were in the Œ in the courtyard. Was a big courtyard 

surrounding the 
Reichs Chancellery
, and there was a big fence around that. And 
we found that in Œ in Œ in one spot, it was like Œ it was not on the ground, it was on 

Œ on Œ on t op of the ground. 

Q: How did you Œ who told you that that™s what it was? 

A: We found out about  that. I mean, it™s a Œ 
we were

they were the ashes from Œ from

Q: Just a pile of ashes? 

A: Because for some Œ pile of ashes, you know, and there were som e Œ also some 
traces of bones, and some other things. We knew the y™r

rem Œ 
remai ns,but we didn™t
 Œ of course, we didn™t know that Œ but t hen later we 

found out that this Œ thi s was Œ and it came to Œ we came t o the concl usion. 

Although, the Russians felt that the y Œ I had a Œ nobody knows t heir reasonings. 

Rather than come out publicly Œ publicly and say l ook, why don™t  we find it, they 

really didn™t Œ were not very much interested i n the detail s. The y felt that Œ for 

some reason they have a Œ the y had a different attitude. They would rather Œ rather 
than start researching documents, t he y would rather send people to Œ t o the gulag. 
Send Nazis to the gulag, i mprison them. Have a short trial  without any Œ

That was their aim, they were so fed up and Œ and so bitter, that t he y Œ they Œ the Œ 

the Germans, for them, were like Œ

Œ they Œ they just were not able t o

the main 
Œ main work was persecuti on of Œ of 
cri minals, and Œ 
[i nterruption] 
In Œ in 
Berlin

Q: So do you Œ you were starting to tell me that you met this Œ 

A: So, I met 
Hel mut
(ph) 
Selten
(ph), and I befriended hi m, and I expl ained to him 

that I have relatives i n 
Cuba
. We became very friendly, and I used t o go to his

was his name. He was a Ukrainian, and he Œ he was a colonel. And I used to ha Œ I 

had with him a very good relationship. He had all his family with hi m in 
Berlin

And like most of the R ussians, he was int erested in Œ in some material help, you 

know. So we Œ what we used to Œ m y assignment was to bring in Œ our assignment 

was to bring in some people from the Œ from t he Œ that used to belong to the Nazi 

party, or that used t o be involved some wa y in the Œ in Œ i n some criminal activities 
or something. And Œ and we used to get hi m as Œ as informers. So we have them on 
our list, we had a Œ one of the informers was a Œ had a gramophone factory. The y™re

the one who had the slaughterhouse. One has a Œ like a ot her type of factory, I don™t 
remember what was. So what Œ 
I used to havea mot
orcycl e, with a si de one. So 

those peopl e were redeemed in a certain wa y. There was al-always the sword of 
Damocles
 was hanging over their Œ over their neck, you know. But they were, in a 
certain wa y, so long they were able to form, and to give all the information about 

some more biggerfish

to our compou Œ t o our compound Œ 
I mean 
Œ and they used to meet with the Œ with 
the Œ used t o come very discreetly. We had a special entrance for them. And the y 

used to give all Œ all ki nd of information, you know. So, when I used to Œ I used to 

go to meet them from t ime to ti me, to visit them, the y used to fill up m y side, 
you  
know, from the motorcycle, like with all kind of meats, and everyt hing, and the y 

used to take that Œ there used to be 
Alexa
nderpla tz
(ph), which was a Œ 
a 
Œ a place, 
a very special place for black market, and Œ and for all kind of illegal activities, you 

know. Used to take that over there, and they used to sell it, and t hen bring the 

money to Œ to Œ to the commander, and you know, to the Œ and t urned it over to 

hi m. He used to gi ve me something like a 
[indecipherabl e]
 and I was very, very 
happy, you know. And then, when I used t o go with the gramophone factory, used 
to be loaded with gramophones, you know. They Œ the Germans, I mean the y Œ 
the y 
had a Œ a very interesti ng thing, i t™s when they Œ  when Œ  
whent he y capitulated, I

mean, that was it. The y wouldn™t get involved in the Œ 
in the

h Colonel 
Baruck
(ph). He Œ he was very friendly wit h the chief of police from Œ from 
Berli n
, 
and the y used to go hunting together, and I was with them, alwa ys. So one da y, I Œ I 
became friendly also with the chief of police, and I told hi m I Œ I sa y, I™m involved 

in Œ in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one sector Œ now 

that 
Berlin
 is divided four sector; the French, the British, the Russian, and the Œ and 
the American. I says, and I am sometimes  in j eopardy, so I need a Œ 
a 
ausweis Œ 
I Œ 
a card, as a German. He hesitated, but then he gave it to me, you know. And I say, 

don™t mention it to anybody, because this is due to m y work, you know. So, when I 
met  with 
Helmut

Selten
(ph), and I di sclosed him that I event ually want to Œ I 
have relatives in 
Cuba
, and I™d like to get out, because pretty soon they™re going t o 
demobilize me and send me back to 
Lithuani a

desire to go back to 
Lithuania
. So we start act ively pursuing, I mean, how to Œ 

what Œ what Œ what  to do, how to Œ so one day he comes for Œ to me, very happy, 

and he says, listen, I mean, there is a Joint Œ t he Joint Distributi on C enter in Œ in 

West Berli n

wear sometimes, civilian clothes al so, because due to m y work, I mean, I used t o

I sa y, okay, let™s Œ l et™s move. So, we took the

we went to Œ I think it was in Œ in

Distribution, and there is a American colonel, and I sa y, look, I™m a Œ a Russian and 
Jewish officer in the Russian arm y, and I would like to Œ  you should help me to

with you, I am trut hfully Œ  
I mean, it™s 
Œ I Œ 
they 
Œ I have no use any more to be 
here. I mean, I have already accomplished what I felt to accomplish. Now I will Œ 

what I want is to Œ to Œ to get to my family, I mean, because I am by m yself. 

The y™re goi ng to send me back to Œ he sai d, look, we™re sorry, but we cannot do 
anyt hing, because we have a very good relat ionship with the Russian, the y™re our 
allies, and we cannot create a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ a international conflict. I say, i nternational  
[indecipherable]
. So I almost 
[indecipherabl e]
 
becauseI sawhere t hat m y 
Œ 
m y 
opportunity to 
Œ t o Œ to Œ to get out, and I thought, the y™re going to Œ l ike, I™m goi ng 
to declare myself like a Œ 
a 
Œ a refugee, and t hen that™s it. So he sa ys Œ he calls on 

his secretary. He said, l ook, you know where your relatives are in

their name? And I sa y, yes, I have t heir name. Do you Œ 
do you know wherethey 
are? I say, no, they™re i n

that to the Jewish community center in 
Havana
, to make the st ory short. And I 
thought, I mean, this is a Œ I mean, he just wanted to get ri d of me, and then he Œ he 

Œ he just 
[i ndecipherable]
. Exactly 20 da ys l ater, 
Helmut
(ph) cal ls me and says, 
hey. He sa ys, I have a letter from 
Cuba
 for you. A mont h later, and I almost fainted, 
you know. I had my, in Yiddish 
[i ndeci pherable]
 
letterfrom m y uncle,telling me 
that m y ot her uncle, you know, that I left, and he was in t he concentration camp i n 

Buchenwa ld
 was liberated. His wife was liberated, and the y tried to locate th
e 
daughter. And that my friend, this 
Prather
(ph), that he was together with me in Œ in 
the Œ in the camps, and I helped hi m, is in 
Munich
, and he™s studying engineering, 
and the y™re going to get in touch with hi m to Œ he should help me escape. And 
pretty soon I received another letter, f rom 
Munich
, from Œ and this letters wer Œ 
went to 
Hel mut
(ph) 
Selten
(ph), not to me, of course, because I had to be very Œ 
very much 
Œ very much careful, because any Œ any step on the side, I would have 
been completely Œ I mean, the y would send me to 
Siberi
a
. Not even that, they 
would shoot me. There would be a court marti al. So Œ can we interrupt for a 

minute? 

Q: Yes. 
[break]
 
A: So I received Œ I received a letter from 
Louie™s
 brother, who was in 
Munich
, 
school of Œ engineering school, and beautiful l etter from him, that he™s going to try

to do everyt hing possible, that he received, he received a Œ 
a 
Œ a letter from 
Cuba
, 
from m y uncles. And incidentally, my Œ 
m y l etter 
[indecipherable]
 
min e 
Œ 
m y 
letter went t o 
Cuba
. I mean, not m y letter, their Œ their Œ their Œ thei r telegram t hat 
they sent from the Œ from the Joint Distribution Center, the y send it t o the Œ to t he 
Jewish Communi ty Center. My uncle was the president at that ti me, from the 

community center. He was the one that brought most of the fami ly, brought the 

other uncle, and everything. So 
Prather
(ph) t old me in his letter Œ I mean, he 
mentioned that he is going to Œ that he has a Œ a hunch that Œ that he has already 

somebody that 
Œ t hat will be able Œ be in Œ that™s going to be helpful in my Œ 
in m y 
defection from the Russian arm y. That ti me, I remember it was already Œ  it was 
Passover. And 
Helmut
(ph), I mean the contact was 
Helmut
(ph) all the ti me. 
Helmut
(ph) calls me again and sa ys there is Œ there is some people t hat came from 
[indecipherable]
 a husband and wife and a child. Three people. And they want t o 
meet with me. So I made sure that nobody™s following me, and I met  with them. 
And this was a guy that  was a Œ a smuggler. He used to smuggle from the Œ from 

the American Œ from the Russian zone, cert ain items to the Ameri can zone, and 

from the American zone to the Russian zone. So he approached me, t old me that he 
is Œ that 
Prather
(ph) sent hi m, and that he understand that I want to be helped to 
cross the border in a certain place, which he Œ he knows very well, he says. And he

travels alwa ys with his wife and child, because that makes Œ doesn™t gi Œ doesn™t 
make hi m too Œ those Œ the people, and the guards to be suspicious. He didn™t know 

that I am Œ 
I am
 in Œ in the Russian army, and 
Prather
(ph) 
ca
utioned me against 
that, he said, don™t tell him that you are in the arm y, because then he i s not going to 

do that, and then he is not going to help you. So I told hi m, look, I™m also in t he 

smuggling business, and I do this and thi s and that, and I have Œ 
have certain 

contacts which I want to see in the Œ in Ameri can zone, and this and t hat. So we 

arranged thi s. I went  to the Œ I left him behind, I went to t he 
ba hnho f
,  to the train 
station, and there were a huge amount of people. I went in uniform, and I bought 

four tickets, to go like t o Œ in the direction of 
Bremen
, with the t rain. Then I Œ I 
took my motorc ycl e
, and I took it  to a safe pl ace, and I call ed a guy, and sa y oka y, 
we have the tickets. When do we go? He sa y, we have to go immediatel y. Sa ys, 

there is no t ime to Œ to waste. I get myself Œ 

Q: Can you hear hi m pretty well? He™s talking so quietly? 

Q2: Yeah, I Œ that™s fine. Sorry to interrupt. 

A: I have a Œ first of all, I cal med down for a minute, and I was very excited, 

because that was a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
incredible step t o take, you know, because to Œ to go out 
Œ it™s not t o leave 
Berlin
, because you see, 
Berlin
 ha Œ was in four sectors. But 
Berlin
 by itself, found itself within the Russian occupational zone, which means 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

130
 
that in order to get out from 
Berli n
 is not  to get out of 
Berlin
, I had to get out from 
the whole zone, to cross through hundred Œ few hundred kilomet ers. And this is not 
Œ it™s not easy, because although at that time, i n 1947 Œ that was already 1947, in 
that ti me there was still  not Œ there was sti ll not as tight as it became ti ghter later. So 
I Œ I figured out, what shall I do? So I had a little, small cal iber pistol, which I took 

away from m y German officer, still in Œ in 
Königsburg
 Œ with Œ the handles were 
made from elephant bone. Beautiful, you know, it™s Œ 
it was 
something remarkable. 
And I had a bunch of Œ first of all, in the Œ in the arm y, the Russi an army I was paid 

as a officer, I received a certain amount of money in Russian rubles, and then a 

double amount in German occupational marks. I had mone y, I had more than what I 
can 
Œ was able to use. And incidentally, I used to send Œ every mont h I was able to 
send two packages, and I used to send to m y relatives in Œ in Œ in 
Kovno
, his 
family. Every Œ 
every 
month I send them two big packages, with all kind of 
goodies. So then I had my Œ  
End of Tape Ei ght

Beginning Tape Nine 
Q: I'll let you finish Œ  
A: 
Right. Let mefinish
 Œ 
let me 
finish this part, which is Œ I will  tell 
you
 somet hing. 
One day, I will talk to 
Spielberg
, you know, one da y we™ll Œ we™l l 
make a very 
profitable film for him. So Œ 
soI had m y German 
ausweis
, which I got from the 
chief of police when we were out hunting. I had m y Œ 
m y 
Russian 
ausweis
. I had 
money, rubles, money i n German occupational  marks, and I have 
a litt
le caliber 
pistol. And the litt le cal iber was Œ was Œ and you will not  believe for what. Not to 

shoot anybody, but to shoot m yself if Œ if Œ if 
they would 
Œ if they would catch me 

because there™s no question in m y mind, th-th
ey would
 Œ they would have done this 
without any reproach, you know. So Œ and then we moved to the Œ moved to the 
train, and I figured already everythi ng out. I figured we have a long voyage to 
a 

small town which is going the direction to 
Bremen
, but 
Bremen
 is in the eng Œ in 
the British Zone of occupation. But I felt that Œ I f igured out, I sai d, I know that this 

train is goi ng to be searched. There is going to be a Œ some type of guard is going to 

come in at some cert ain point to check the documenta Œ documents on the train. 

Because that  was a normal procedure and I Œ I knew it™s going t o happen. I also Œ I 
thought to m yself, it™
s goi
ng to come in a German guard, I™m going t o show them 
that I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relati ves. And I didn™t have a 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

132
 
problem because I Œ I had also this 
Baruck
(ph), m y colonel, was out of town. He 
was in Œ in 
Moscow
 for a conference, and I had the right to Œ to Œ to t ravel to 
a 
certain Œ certain distance, because I need Œ I 
neede
d a special permit, which I didn™t 
have. But I could Œ I could 
justify my
 trip, you know, because I di dn™
t 
Œ I didn™t 
carry with me any Œ 
any 
Œ  
any 
belongings or anyt hing, it ™s just only 
a 
small thing. 
Then I said, if it comes a Russian, I™m going to identify m yself as a German. What 

can I
 do? Oka y. We Œ we travel. 
Thetrain wascrowded. I mean, socrowdedit was
 
that Œ were unable t o turn. Suddenly, we come to a certain point, there™s soldiers. 

Russian and Germans together. I sa y, that™s my da y. That™s my da y, what shall I do? 

And I had t o think quickly. I was next to t he guy with the Œ with  
his wife
, and we 
were chatting and Œ and here comes the guard, documents, document s, documents. I 
ventured to pull out m y German rat her than Russian, and I think I made the right 

decision, youknow.In the middle of 
Œ of Œ of Œ of looking at my Œ 
checking my 
document, the child starts crying. And some way that tension was deflected, and I 

was da Œ I Œ I think it was a sheer Œ sheer l uck for me, you know. And the y just only 

ask me where I travel , and I said Œ I knew right town and 
[indeciphera ble]
. So why 
do you come 
[indecipherable]
. And I said a few words i n German, you know, and 
Œ and m y worries were over. The y came to the Œ al most t o the border. We co
me o ff
. 
Then he said to me, no, we have to go now. We have to walk now for about two

kilometers, because there is a place where I will always go through, but there is a 
very little where Œ sometimes even Œ they don't have even a guard on the border. 

Because you see, it™s not 
anatural border, now
 where they Œ which t hey had Œ when 
t
hey made later
, in t he l ater years, li ke 
when they 
Œ when they had the air supply, 
Berlin
, and th-that was much more difficult to escape now. But in 1947, was sti ll Œ 
you know, it was still at a point where the war was still Œ 
I mean, 
the y were still not 
Œ not so organized now. And I remember when we crossed Œ 
I mean, 
there Œ we 

heard some shots on the other side 
[indeci phera ble]
 but i t was not 
relevant. We 
crossed and there were Œ not the last, there were quite a few people who Œ who 

crossed. Apparently, this was the place where we crossed the border. And there was 
a big sign t hat said, you are entering the British Zone of occupation. If you have 
some 
armaments, or some illegal Œ  illegal i tems, the 
kommandantur
 is here, here, 

and here. You have to i mmediate i dentify yourself and deliver that to the 

kommandantur
. I kissed the ground when I found myself in this. And then I Œ I 
pulled out, the first thing, I-I threw m y pistol and I said, 
t hehell with that,
 I was 

going to throw Œ this guy grabs me by the hand, he says, what is that ? I didn™t know 

you were armed, he said to me. I said, why not ? And he said, it™s Œ it™s completely 
prohibited. Y
ou cannot have arms. I mean, it™
s 
Œ it™s Œ it™s against Œ I mean, it™s 
against the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the terms, you know. So who are you? What ha Œ

are not a smuggler like you told me. I said, no, no, I™m sorry to tell you, but I™m a 
Russian officer. He sa ys, you™re craz y. How come you di dn't tell me? I sa y, b
ecause 

I didn't feel it was irrel Œ relevant to tell you. He said, g
i ve me, 
give me.Let me see 
the pistol. I said Œ he say 
[indecipherabl e]
, took it, he sa ys, you know what, I™ m 
going to bury that right here. When I come back, I™ll take it. It™
s wort h 
Œ it™s worth 
500 dollars, he sa y, that™s Œ this i s so beautiful. This Œ thi s is real Œ real elephant 

bone handle. I mean, that™s Œ it™s worth a fortune. I said, you can have it. You need 

some marks?
 I told 
hi m, you have here marks also,
 because the y are useless here. 
Because I had Œ I had the Russian occupat ion Œ 
I mea
n, the German occupational 
marks, whi ch belong to the Œ on the Russian border Œ on t he Œ the Œ the Russian 
zone, not the Œ the Œ the British and the Ameri can zone had different Œ different 
marks, you know. So I gave it to him and t hen we went to Œ from there we went t o 

Bremen
. In 
Bremen
, we slept in the Œ in the railroad station. I red Œ I had 
m y 
knapsack and 
m y 
Œ m y boots were m y Œ 
m y pi llow

had to go to 
Bergen

So  
I went t o

first time, I had a good meal, you know. Fantastic, you know, sa
y 
Œ with 
some 
American products, and some other thing. I forgot to mention to you that when we 
were in the Œ in 
Berlin
, I had to mention t o you something very important, that I Œ I 
overlooked something. Beingin 
Berlin
, we had a Œ I had a  special mission. I don't 
know how many people are aware, but I-I don't think too many are aware of that. 
I™m going to tell you that the y Œ 
the y 
have t ransplanted factories from Berlin to 

some
 Œ they Œ the y used to take them to different parts of 
Russia
. So I was assigned 
a mission with a truck with three soldiers to go to Œ 
the y have
 Œ taking out the 
IG
 
Fa rben 
company from 
Berlin
, and they are supposed to be shipped to 
Leningrad
 
to dismant le 
completel y. Notonly dismantle, wh
at the y have Œ our assignment was 
to take the workers, including even the Œ the Œ the Œ the lowest pai d guy, like, the Œ 
the Œ the guy that cleans the factory. Everybody had to be placed on a train by five 

o™clock in t he morning. And we used to come with a truck and come to the house 

and knock on the door and say, out in five minutes.

S o 
you have five minutes to Œ to get your bel ongings and Œ and out on the car. This 

was such a pleasure, this task that I had. Of course, it was nothing compared to what 

they have done to me. But it was, I Œ I cer Œ I found a certain Œ alt hough, I didn™t 
have anythi ng against the Œ against  the guys, t hose 
guys thatworked there 
in the 
factory, no. Now, t his Œ this factory, for a fact, the y were so organized Œ the Œ the Œ

the Russians were so organi Œ disorganized, that it took t hem 
X
 amount of months 
to reach the destiny for the factory. And then they found out that part of the factory 
went to one place, to 
Smolensk
 and the other one went to 
Leni
ngrad
. And tha-t hat 
was the what Œ what the Œ but if that Œ what th Œ I had to mention that, because that 

was a very, very unique experience, you know, whereby I Œ I was in charge of Œ of  
taking Œ I mean, to Œ di sassembling and taking those people to the trai n station at  

five o™clock, and Œ and it Œ it was 
a 
Œ a remarkable Œ you know, sometimes you 

remember certain Œ c
er
tain Œ so oka y, so wh-when 
I came
 Œ when I came to 
Munich
, I  Œ it happened to be those people that I used to send packages. Those 
relatives were in 
Feldafing
.  
Q: The y were in 
Muni ch
? 
 
A: Next to 
Munich
 was small 
DP
 camps. One was 
Landsberg
, and the other was Œ 
was 
Feldafing
. They were in 
Feldafing
. So I stayed couple days i n 
Prather™s
 

h ome,
 and then he t ook me to 
Feldafing
, because the y are Œ they™re relatives. And 
this lady, 
Fruma
(ph) 
L ankavich
(ph), she went out her wa y to accommodate me 
and to Œ and to Œ and to help me out. And what Œ what I wanted basicall y is to Œ to 
get Œ get out from 
Germany
 and go to Œ to 
Cuba
. So there was Œ I asked her Œ 
from 
there, I wrot e already freely, you know, to Œ to 
Cuba
, and they Œ they 
send me 
some
 Œ 
they send meletters
, and 
the y 
send me also a letter saying t hat  the y have Œ

the y instit uted a vi sa in Œ in Œ in fr Œ in 
Paris
, to go to Œ 
I mean
 t o Œ in order to 
come to Cuba. Now, how do you go to 
Paris
? I don™
t have any
 Œ 
any 
Œ 
any
 
documents. 
So  
I start working on documents. In the meant ime, a 
guy came by and 
he said that he is Œ he™s capable to Œ you know, we™re 
very desperate, youknow. 
The time was now important to Œ to get out. I mean, we just wanted to reach already 
a destiny, after so many pain and suffering. So we had Œ the guy said that for a 

hundred dollars, he is going to make me false papers to travel to 
France
. So I Œ I 
found a Œ a Œ 
a 
friend of Œ of the family, with the name of 
Bernard
 
Picard
(ph), 
who also in 
Kovno
 ghetto. And he was a brigadier, the other brigade, 
Bernard
 
Pica
rd
(ph). And he le Œ he lend me the Œ t he hundred dollars. And I gave it to t he 
guy and he made me this paper, it didn™t look t o me good, but I figured he Œ he Œ he 

knows what he™s doing. But through the train, we went to 
Strasbourg
, and through 
Saargebiet
, you know. And when we came to 
France
, the 
Sûreté
 
came o
ut, the 
French poli ce took us off an-
an
d Œ and sent Œ was going to send us back. And I Œ I 
got very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from t he Russians and I 

just flushed it down the toilet, you know. Because I figured ma ybe they are goi
ng to 

send me back to the 
[indecipherable]
 Œ you know, that t ime you were fearful, you 
didn™t know. They might send you back t o Œ t o your dest iny, where you Œ 
yo u
 were 
coming from. So t hen I came back to Œ to 
Feldafing
, 
and westart working 
legally
.

And sh
ehelped me so much,this 
Fruma
(ph). Fortunately, they went later to 
Canada
, and she™ s passed away now. So then Œ then I was able to Œ 
I got
 Œ I got 
already the Œ the real papers went t o 
France
, and then there I had m y visa. I spent in 
France
 
a few
 da ys, and then I found out, in order to go to 
United States
 Œ to 
Cuba
, 
I have to go through 
United States
 and I need a visa. This is eight months. You had 
to wait for eight months for Œ to get Œ to get a visa to 
United
 
States
. S
o I started  Œ I 
had all Œ I found al so a other guy t hat was going to 
Cuba
, by the name Œ same name 
like me, 
Abra ham
, but  his name was 
Rabi
nowitz
(ph). And he told me, wherever 
you go, I go with you. I said, fine. So I start walking up and down in Œ in 
France
, in 

Paris
, and Œ and looking. I spoke a little Engli sh, you know, it was easier for me 
because he didn™t. And I start looking. Fi nally, I found Œ we found a maiden flight 
of a six-motor hydroplane from Air 
France
, t hat was going to 
Dakar
, 
Africa
, and 
Port-Étienne
. And from t here Œ and to Œ from 
Dakar
 to 
Port-Étienne
. So we Œ 
what I did i s, we had our tickets from 
Pan American
. We
 exchanged that, 
and the 

company, t he y gave us credit and some way we hustled around and Œ and all Œ all  

togeth Œ and all together, what we had was 10 dollars in o ur pocket. Then we took 

the trip wit h this six-motor hid Œ hydroplane and it took us Œ it was an incredible 
flight
, you know
. The y gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there. 
And then when we came to Œ to 
Po

, we had to go to 
Antigua
 Œ Briti sh

Antigua
. So from there, we went Œ we had to take a boat and go there, to British 
Antigua
. And 
then from British 
Antigua
, we found out that in order to go to 
Cuba
, 
we need stil l an Ameri can transit visa because we have to sta y in 
Puerto
 
Rico
, 
which is an American Œ  
Q: You were carrying a French passport now?  

A: I didn't have a passport.  

Q: No?  

A: I ha Œ I had a paper which sa ys, stateless A Œ 
a 
Œ a person without a countr
y.  
That was there for everybody™s st andards. It was like Œ so finally, in Œ in 
Antigua
, 

there was a Œ it™s a very small British island, but very clean. I remember comparing 
it to the Œ t o the Œ to Œ t o the French, which was just the opposite. The counsel was 
staying at the same hotel that we stayed there. And the lady that Œ w
e t
old her our 

stories and made arrangements for us to Œ to see the counsel the next day. So next 

day when we went i n, and so the first question of the counsel was, do you have 

some money to sleep overnight in Œ in Œ i n Œ i n 
Puerto
 
Rico
?  I said, of course. I 

show hi m the 10 dollars very proudly. When I came out, I gave it t o m y friend. H
e 

came in wit h the same 10 dollars, and show that he has also 10 dollars, because that 
was the mini mum that you can have. And t hen August 1
st
 Œ and from t here we 
cabled m y uncle that we were comi ng down. So August 1

.  
Q: Long trip.  
A: It was a long tri p but I found somebody waiting for me.  
Q: Now Œ  

A: Now, go ahead with the questions.  

Q: I have a couple of questions. I want you to turn your chair back a l ittle bit thi s 

way. 
 
A: That™s not the questi on, that™s t he answer. 
[brea k]
 
Q: Go on, keep goi ng. Oka y, now, there are a couple of things that we talked about.  
A: That are missing.  
Q: Yes. One is the Œ the 
Ninth Fort
.  

A: Yeah, the Œ yeah, ri ght.  

Q: In late Œ late 1943. You can 
tell  mewhat your memory isof
 that?  
A: Yes. This Œ thi s is is precisely Œ I have a book of that which I have not had a 

chance to Œ t o read. The Œ the 
Ninth Fort
 was one of the most vicious and crimi nal 

places in Œ i n the Œ 
Lithuania
, whereby, most of the Œ most of the inmates from Œ 
from the camps were taken, and Œ 
t aken
. And i t was Œ we had few forts, but the 
Ninth Fort
 was the Œ was the one that™s for Œ were the Œ t hat was best equipped to Œ 

 
Interview with Abe Resnick

141
 
to kill and also to dispose of the bodies. B ut you see, there were so many Œ 
so many 
people were killed Œ or murdered, not killed Œ at the 
Ninth Fort
, that theydidn™
t 
have Œ didn™t give t hem ti me to get rid of the bodies. So what t he y did is, the y used 
to burn Œ they used to place them in Œ in Œ i n Œ in rows, you know, one on top of the 
other one. But then, apparently towards at the end of 1943, there came a order from 

the 
Reichs
 command t hat it has t o be somethi ng done in order to eli minate the 

bodies. So the y were Œ they looked for a 
So nderkommando
, and they took a 
number of Œ of 
people and
 Œ of Jews from the Œ from Œ 
from 
the ghetto. And the y 

had decided the y had some other people, which they kept there for a l ong ti me. 

What the y used to do with those people i s, after the y Œ after they did their Œ thei r 
dirty work, they used to kill them and then bri ng in some new people, you know, 
because the y Œ they al ways tried t o Œ to hide t heir tracks behind Œ and Œ and Œ and 
the evidence behind them. So the y brought in this contingency of the 

So nderkomma ndo
, and they were there for some ti me, and the y Œ they t ried to Œ  
they exhumed the Œ the bodies and they tried t o burn them. And the way the y di d Œ 
they used t o do that, they used to lay them in Œ in layers and Œ and put in wood in 

between and then pour gas and then Œ 
and the, o
f course, in the concentration camps 
they used crematori ums, which were more Œ 
mo
re advanced technology. This, the
y 
did it in more pri mitive wa y. And incident ally, I have some friends who are Œ

especially one friend that send me now a book, that escaped, one of the escapees. I 
mean, this was an i ncredible, incredible escape, which is l ike escaping from 
Sing
 
Sing
, or for Œ whereby, the y Œ they have pl an. The y knew that the y are not going to 
last too long because after the y burn, 
I mean, 
t hey are going to be one of those who 
are going to be burned also. So what the y plott ed is, the y found t hemselves that they 

Œ they have, 
New Year™s 
Eve, they have some wa y got some additional Œ additional 

liquor for the guards and they Œ when the y were drunk, the y traced Œ t
hey hada map 
of the ninth Œ of the 
Ninth Fort
 and they Œ some wa y the y were able t
o escape and 

this was a escape li ke a large group of Œ of Œ of people was 
able to escape
, you 
know. And this Œ  
Q: Where di d the y go?  
A: Pardon?  

Q: Where di d the y go?  

A: The y Œ many of them went to the Œ 
to the
 partisans. Especially my friend. He 

joined the Œ he joined t he Œ the freedom fighters, and he Œ he survived. I mean, he Œ 
he survived being i n the underground in the freedom fighters.  

Q: When you refer to t he partisans, are you talking about Russian partisans, 
Lithuanian partisans, Jewish partisans?  
A: The y were Œ the y were a mixture. The y were a mixture. The y had Œ they had Œ

most Œ most of the time, they had Lithuanian Œ had Œ 
had a 
Œ in some cases, where 
head of the partisans was Œ were Li thuanian. In many cases, more of the cases, the y 

were Œ 
the y were 
Russi ans. But there were some few Lithuanian part isans, head of 
partisans al so, depen
di nginwhat section were you
, in what part of the Œ  

Q: But did they fight together in the same groups?  

A: No, not necessarily, no.  

Q: 
So  
when the people fro
m 
Kovno 
Œ  

A: Yeah.  

Q: Œ went out into the Œ 

A: Right. 
Q: Œ forest to fight like you did for a while, were you basically on your own or were 
you
 Œ you Œ you 
had
 
a differentexperience, but 
Œ  
A: Yeah, I was, yes.  

Q: Œ but Œ but did the y ever join up with the Russians?  

A: The y Œ t he y used to Œ they used to try t o join up at one point. But it was always Œ 

it was Œ practically, it was not to be in bi g groups, because big groups are spotted 

much easier than small er groups. Even when t hey had bigger groups, they used t o 
separate themselves in Œ in Œ in smaller groups, and disperse themsel ves in 
different Œ in different places.

Q: What I was trying t o understand is if the Russians had the Jewish 
partisans 
[i ndecipherable]
  
A: The y were a supply Œ they were not Œ t he y were in Œ in some places, the y were 
in the 
Rudnitski
(ph)
 
Pushch
e
, t here were Jewish partisans. Some of  them there are 
still the 
Belski
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
. They were Œ the y were strong, maybe five Œ 
600. That was a big, big contingency. But  there w
ere 
pushche
, you know, 
pushche
 
means? It™s a forest which is very dense and very, very difficult to penetrate. It™s 

like a jungle. But normall y, 
Lithuania
 was not so dense, and 
especiall y wh
ere we 
were, close t o 
Janava
. There was a forest, but it was not this type, not a great, great  

forest.  
Q: 
How many
 Œ how long were you out in the forest?  
A: About five weeks.  
Q: Would you sa y that as a full sentence?  

A: Pardon? Pardon?  

Q: Would you sa y that as a full sentence?

When you

incredible feeling to go back into Œ  
A: You mean when I came back to the ghet to? First Œ first Œ first trip was Œ 
m y trip 
was to the ghetto. I mean, I Œ I Œ I was very anxious to find out what happened t o 
the house where I li ved and to the Œ and to the basement where w
e had
 Œ where 
very 
ingen Œ ingeniously, we Œ we used to make basements even during the ti me in the 

ghetto, in many places. And that™s the reason why the y Œ  somebody Œ somebody Œ I 
mean, betra yed us, you know. There were some-
some
body betr
a yed  many,  many o f
 
those, bu Œ  and that™s one of reasons why t he y came in. How did the Germans find 

out? Because this was done so carefully. The Œ the Œ the Œ the sand or the Œ the soil 
was taken so carefully, and it was done in the nightti me. And it was l ike Œ like Œ  
termi
tes, you know, a slow, very slow process. And how did they know where it is? 
Imagine, in Œ in Œ i n my house, when I came in, we had Œ what we had is steps to 

the second f loor. So what we did i s Œ 
it was
 like, professionally engi neered. We 

were able to take out a whole step and right through there, slide i nto t he Œ to Œ to the 

basement.  

Q: To hide?  

A: Pardon?  
Q: To hide?  
A: To hide. To hide Œ in fact, hide things there where I Œ where was I Œ 
hidden m y

m y 
cousin.  
Q: A lot of people made hiding pl aces?  
A: A lot of people made hiding pl aces, yeah. And Œ and for some reason, they Œ  
they found out. My place was open. When I came, it was open. And I found only 
some photographs. I didn't find anything else, you know. But it was not Œ it was not 

destroyed. It was not bombed. But in many other cases, were bombed. And some 

people were buried under the Œ under the rubbl e of the Œ of the Œ of the Œ the y used 

to come in and throw grenades to make sure that Œ just the Germans would come 

into a house and whether there is somebody or not, throw a grenade and everything 

would Œ if one was not sufficient, throw a other grenade.  
Q: Did you s Œ 
di d you s
ee any Jewish people around? Were there other people 

around when you Œ  

A: No, no. When I came I Œ I didn™t Œ I didn™t see anybody. I mean, I saw people 

wandering, but I found out that there were Œ there were Œ few families saved 

themselves. And they were able to come out, to come Œ although they exploded 

most of them, but few families Œ but that was really Œ I came in, it was already five, 
six days after they l iberated the Œ t he city, 
you know, 
so people already came out. 
Some wa y they sensed that the y are Œ that t he y are free, and the y Œ and they came 

out. So I was not able, but I Œ I went Œ I went in down Œ down to the Œ and I found Œ

I found some photographs which I Œ which I cherish. And I Œ and I have them with 
me so far, you know, so Œ  

Q: Do you think that there was a special spirit of defiance in 
Kovno
, when peopl e Œ 
like, the people escaping from the 
N
inth Fort
, or the hiding, or t he going to the 
forest? Do you think there was something unique about this, as a spiritual 
resistance?  

A: Of course. I think it was in every place. The only thing is that  Œ that people Œ it™s 

very hard f
orpeople to understand that 
Œ t hat i n 
Lithuania
 was Œ you see, I don't 
know about 
Poland
 
as much, you know
 Œ 
but in 
Lithua
nia
, was very difficult to Œ 
to penetrate and to go t hrough 
because we have 
Œ we had t wo la yers of Œ of Œ 
of 
difficulties. One was that the Lithuan
ians wer
e very, very much anti-
Semi
tic in a 
sense, and they would Œ they would betra y Œ most of them, you know, most of 
them Œ 
betray anybody th
at tried to hide or that tried to reach somet hing. Because 
many
 Œ most of my friends were ki lled by Œ were Œ were Œ were Œ I mean, caught 
by
 Œ by Lit huanians. The same ti me when I Œ I was almost caught by a Lithuanian. 
It was not a German. German wouldn™t know me fr-
fr
o m 
Œ from nothing, whether I 
am Jewish ornot, you know
. But the y Œ they have sense, the y have Œ they Œ the
y 
were able to identify. And it was extremely, extremely difficult, and the y were not 

cooperative. The y 
Œ 
they didn™
t provide you wi th arms, the y betrayed you, they Œ

they did Œ they did Œ 
they did 
everything possi ble to Œ to hurt you rather than to help 
you. So it was extremely difficult, but it was Œ the spirit of resistance was alwa ys 
there. Of course, we Œ we didn™t have this Œ this help, the necessary Œ  you have 
to hel Œ have to Œ you have to have outside hel p in order Œ without outside help, you 

cannot Œ you cannot do  anything, you know. I mean, it™s Œ it™s not a mat ter that Œ 

that you can serve yourself. Where Œ where are you going to get armaments
