Question.  Hello, Mrs. Mann.  Can you pl
ease tell me what is your current name?
 
Answer.  It's Rena, R-E-N-A, and 
my last name is Mann, M-A-N-N.
 
Q: Okay .  And was that your name at birth?
 
A: Yes -- no.  My name at birth was Renate Wollstein.
 
Q: And can you please spell that for me as w ell?
 
A: Okay .  R-E-N-A, T like in Tom, and E li
ke in Edward, Renate, and my maiden name 
was W-O-L-L, S like in Sam, T like in Tim, E 
like in Edward, I like in
 Ida, and N like in 
Nelly.
 
Q:Great.  Great.  And can tell me
 where you were born, please?
 
A: Yes, I was born in Berlin, Germany.
 
Q: And your date of birth?
 
A: 4/4/27.
 
Q: Great.  And can you tell me a little bit a
bout what it was like with your family in 
Berlin and growing up; a litt
le bit about your mom and y
our dad and your household; 
whether you had any 
siblings; just a littl
e bit about your fam
ily life in general.
 
A: Well, I don't remember much
 about Berlin because my pa
rents divorced.  My mother 
went back  to Poland, to Katowice -- I don't k n ow
 if you're familiar with that part of the 
country.
 
Q: Okay . 
 
 
A: And that used to belong to
 Germany once and then  the Po
les  took over.  Anyhow, she 
went to her mother like th
ey do today, kids to divorce and go back  home.
 
Q: Right.
 

A: And she did the same thing.  So as fa
r as Germany's concerned, I don't rememb er 
mu ch.  I don't rememb er anything about my  life growin g up.
 
Q: So how old were you wh en
 you moved with your mo ther?
 
A: I think I must have been four or five.
 
Q: Okay.  So you 
were very young?
 
A: I was young and young -- beca
use life was so different, kids were treated so different 
at that time of my life than now.  I think 
a five year old now knows everything what's 
going on already, practically, they play on th
e computers and all that good stuff; and of 
course I come from the olden days, like my  son calls it.
 
Q: And you moved with to Kato wice 
just with your mother. Correct?
 
A: Just with my mother.  And we, and 
we stayed at my grandmother's for --
 
Q: So do you know anything 
really about your father, wh
en you left him behind in 
Berlin?
 
A: Not much.  I used to see my fa
ther once a year during vacation time.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And he used to go to  Bres
lau.  He came from Berlin to Breslau and I came from 
Katowice on my  vacation to  Breslau too.  I ha
d an aunt in Breslau and th at's when I saw 
him.  And I didn't like 
to go with him because I didn't know the man.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: You know, I saw him once a year and somebod
y tells you th is is your father.  It didn't 
mean very much to me at 
that, you know, at that age.
 
Q: Right.  I understand.
 
A: You know, seven and now eight.
 
Q: All right.
 
A: So an yhow my 
mother remarried.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I had a wonderful stepfather.
 
Q: And what was his name?
 
A: Kurt Israel.
 

Q: Can you spell that for me, please?
 
A: Yes.  K-U, R like in Robert, T like in 
Tom; Israel, you know how to  spell Israel?
 
Q: Yes, I do.  Thank you.
 
A: Okay .
 
Q: And you said he was wonderful.  And di
d your mo ther remarry him shortly after you 
moved to  Katowice?
 
A: Well, I would say maybe two years, a year
 and a half later.  I 
really can 't tell you 
exactly because honestly I don't rememb er ex
actly what year it wa
s that she remarried.
 
Q: Okay .  But he was wond
erful and you rememb er him?
 
A: He was very good to me.  And, yes, I 
do rememb er him.  And he survived  the war.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Well, I think I'm ju mping ahead.
 
Q: Yes, you are.  And di
d your -- did they  have an
y other children togeth er?
 
A: No.  No.
 
Q: Okay.  So you 're liv ing in Katowice
 now with your moth
er and stepfather?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And what happens next?
 
A: Next -- what happens next 
-- we have our own apartment.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I got enrolled into a privat
e school in order to learn Polish.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And this school was -- you know, the classr
ooms were so mu ch smaller, so I learned 
fast.  My mother never learned Polish, only sp
oke German.  And I went to school.  I was 
a school -- like any other kids at my age.  I we
nt to school every day and I came home.  I 
did my  homework.  And in summertime I went
 outside to play, and in  wintertime I had 
skis.  I went little bit of -- did a 
little bit of skiing, nothing much.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: And used to spend a lot of time at my  gra
ndmother's, my  cousins, the only cousins that 
lived in Poland.  I was very close to him,
 we were just a few months apart in age.
 

Q: Okay .
 
A: And he was alone and I was 
alone, had no siblings either. 
 And so that's how my  life 
was in Katowice.
 
Q: And what did your mo m and stepfa
ther do?  What was their life like?
 
A: My stepfather managed a factory, a soap 
factory, which was in -- it was in the family 
so he was in charge 
of that soap factory.
 
Q: GotchA:
 
A: And my mo ther did nothing.
 
Q: Okay .  And what was your life like with
 them?  I mean, were you -- did you -- you 
know, were you a happy child; did you spend a 
lot of time with them; did you go to any 
sort of Hebrew school? You 
had mentioned private school.
 
A: No.  I really didn't  -- it's so differe
nt.  Do you know anything ab out Europe, how 

different it was -- well, you're too young to  know.
 
Q: Well, I have some sense fro
m talking to  my  grandparents.
 
A: Yeah.  It was -- you didn't  spend as mu ch
 time with your parents as the people -- as 
the kids do here because --
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: We had, you know, everybody had eith
er -- maid serv ice was very cheap, and 
everybody had a maid, you didn't
 have to be rich, and middle 
class people all had maids.  
And the kids usually spent more time 
with the maids than  with the parents.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And we did certain, you know,
 the holid ays, of course, we were always together at my  
grandmother's and my  aunt, my  mo ther's sist
er from Breslau, came to Katowice and we 
were always a happy family.  And I was a happ
y child, I think.  I ha
d nothing not to be 
why -- hard for me to explain but anyhow.
 
Q: Now, you're doing fine.
 
A: Noth ing -- just a normal childhood 
at that point wh en I lived in...
 
Q: And what language did you speak at home?
 
A: German.
 
Q: Okay .  And did you have any hobbies?  I 
know you had mentioned skiing.  Were there 
any like organizations that you we
re affiliated with at the time?
 

A: Yeah.  I was with Bacopa (sp).  I 
don 't know if you're familiar with it.
 
Q: Yes.  Can you tell me a l
ittle bit about that and when you
 did that and 
did you meet 
any friends doing th at?
 
A: You know, the school I went to I 
was the only Jewish girl in my class.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And through that all my friends were actua
lly non-Jewish.  Did I make any friends at 
Bacopa, I really don't remembe
r.  I remember more the scho
ol friends than I remember 
the Bacopa friends.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I had another problem with the school
 when I went into fi
fth grade, which was 
my  last grade I attended school, af
ter that I had no more schooling.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: They wouldn't put me through because I di
dn't  have a grade for religion.  Because 
until such time -- until the fourth
 grade nobody said anything. 
 But when it ca
me to in the 
fifth grade, they wouldn't put me through 
because I wasn't -- the grade for religion was 
missing.
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: So I had to take a special course with th
e Rabbi to teach me all the highlights in order 
to get --
 
Q: To go through?
 
A: To, yeah, to get a grade in Hebr
ew -- in religion to put me through.
 
Q: I understand.  So  did you, 
did you go to  synagogue at all?
 
A: Yes.  I did.  Not too much.  My gran
dmother, I remember, us
ed to go like for Yom 
Kippur.  She used to go
, you know, all day long.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: Not my parents.  My mother 
-- we were just very reformed.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: But my  grandmother was mo re religious.  
But we were -- like I sa
id, she spend all day 
in temp le.  I used to go and bring her an appl
e with stuff pushed into  it so that she could 
smell it.  I remember that, th
at ma de an impression on me.
 

Q: I understand.
 
A: I don't know if you're familiar 
with something like that or not.
 
Q: I haven't heard that before but that's a nice memo ry.
 
A: Yes, that's what I re
member.  Oh, I remember a 
lot about my  grandmother.
 
Q: Is there anything else you would like to shar
e about her or do we come to it later in the 
story?
 
A: We can -- no, I don't think later -- well,
 yeah, that will be later in  the story.
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember an ything abou
t your mother or stepfather's  political 
affiliations?
 
A: No.  No .  I don't know anything.  Because, 
like I said, we were treated as kids.  We 
were not pulled in and didn't  h
ear everything what was going on.
 
Q: What was going on, right.
 
A: We were sent out of the room.  If ther
e was something being talked about, we were 
told to go and get a glass of wa
ter and let the water on so that 
it gets really very cold.  In 
order to fill up the glass so we don't 
come back too quickly into the room.
 
Q: I understand.  And is there anything spec
ific that you remember
 abou t Kato wice su ch 
as the relationship between the Jews
 and th e non-Jews in the town?
 
A: I know that there was already 
anti-Semitism -- how do you say that?
 
Q: Anti-Semitism.
 
A: Anti-Semitism because there was people wh
o had said don't buy at the Jews, don't -- 
but my  uncle had opened store an
d they used to say don't buy, 
that's  a Jew, and that's a -- 
Jews to blame for Jesu s' demise.   And when 
we had matzah at Passover we used to say 
there's blood in there from Jesu
s and th ey're made with blood 
and things like that.  So it 
started, it really started.  And of course wh en  somebody talked about it, to you about it, of 
course you were always diffe
rent, you weren't like the othe
r Jews you were a different 
Jew.
 
Q: Well, you had mentioned that you we
re the only Jew in your class at school.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Did you feel any anti-Sem
itism from the other children?
 
A: No.
 
Q: No?
 

A: I really didn't .  But, like 
I said, the kids were not as involved in  everything like the 
kids here at that age.
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: We were mu ch mo re -- so I don't know if th e kids heard what the parents were saying.  
I doubt it.
 
Q: But you felt general an
ti-Semitism in the town?
 
A: Yes.  It started in abou
t '38, and befo re the war too.
 
Q: I understand.  And as -- you were still you
ng at this time, but did you know anything 
about Hitler or the Nazi party or what  was going on, you know, in Germany?
 
A: Yes.  I remember the Nazi party from Be
rlin because they were
 chased.  When we 
were in Germany, my mother an
d I still, that stuck in my 
mind that people were chased 
and I found out later they were chasing the 
Nazis at that time becau
se they were just 
coming up.  And the govern ment -- you know, 
they weren't, you know, they  weren't in 
power yet, the Nazis.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So th ey were like chased.  I rememb er th
e chasing of people but I didn't know at the 
time why they were chased but of course late
r I found out later in my life what it all was 
about.
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: So th at's  the only things 
that I remember from Germany.
 
Q: And when do you remember first seeing th
e Nazis or feeling their presence in the 
town?
 
A: When -- right when -- in 
1939 when  they  invaded Poland.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: So I felt it right away because my
 whole life changed.  We left --
 
Q: So can you tell me a little bit 
about that from the very beginning?
 
A: 1939 it was -- no.  September the 1st, when
 the war broke out, a
nd my  parents thought 
that if we move from Katowice to Kraków -- you know Kraków?
 
Q: Yes, of course.
 
A: There was an apartment ther
e for us.  My aunt, who was in soap factory, she had a 
beautiful apartment in Kraków 
and she went to England and sh
e said we can use it.  And 

my parents thought that Hitler won't come th at far, Katowice and Kraków is about two 
hours away but I don't know w
hy we thought that we
 would be safe in Kraków.  So we 
left everything behind, including our
 dog, and we went to Kraków.
 
Q: And how did you get there?
 
A: We went -- how did we get there?  Th
at I can't tell you, I don't know.  I don't 
reme mb er how we got there.  But calm was --  ____+ --
 
Q: But you remember leav
ing ev erything behind and --
 
A: Yeah.  That I know because we just went 
-- of course our personal things I'm sure we 
took.  But we left the place the way -- we wa
lked out because we wanted to avoid the 
Nazis taking over Katowice.
 
Q: So you left in a hurry?
 
A: So we left in a hurry, and we had the apar
tment in Kraków and we
 settled down there.  
And that mu st have been thirty -- was it '39 or
 -- I think '39.  Yeah.  And of course the 

Nazis marched right in.  After they had Kato
wice, they came to Kr
aków and took Poland 
over all together.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Except for part, I think, of Russia too.
  You know something, it is all -- it is an 
overload in my  head, honestly.
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: Because so much happened an
d so much time elapsed that 
it's melting altogether right 
now.
 
Q: That's o k ay.  You're doi
ng wonderfully.  You know, wh
atever co mes to mi nd and you 
tell me, just do your best.
 
A: So, anyhow, we lived in that  apartment and right away they
 came that we had to wear 
-- I don't know first the Jewish star or the band --
 
Q: The yellow star or the yellow band?
 
A: Yeah.  We had a band on our 
arm and that was right away the first things that we had 
to do, and that I remember.
 
Q: And you remember the 
Nazis coming into Kraków?
 
A: Oh, yeah.  It didn't take lo
ng.  They  took Katowice and, 
like I said, they didn't take 
long and they were in Kraków.  I 
mean, it didn't take them very long.
 

Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: Where we thought, my  parents thought at
 that time th ey would not come there but 
they did.
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: And what else -- and --
 
Q: They made you wear the bands.  And what
 were your parents doing at this time?  
Like, had your stepfath er started work in
g in Kraków when you first moved there?
 
A: No.  No.  No.  No.  My st
epfather left with a lot of 
other men, they were walking 
towards RussiA:
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: They left the women alone so  they can 
escape from the German
s because the Germans 
killed, I think, a lot of men.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And so th e men were more scared than 
th e women an d the men took off.  And so my 
mother and I were alone.
 
Q: In Kraków?
 
A: In Kraków.
 
Q: And did your stepfather leave before the N
azis came to Kraków or
 when they came to 
Kraków?
 
A: I think th ey started leaving already. 
 He said something where I'm not sure.
 
Q: That's o k ay.  That
's  okay.  No problem.
 
A: Like I said, I wasn't -- I was a very prot
ected child to a certain, you know, to certain 
time when my  parents could no longer protec
t me.  And I really don't, don't rememb er.  
Certain things like you ask me, I couldn't tell 
you.  I don't know we came there by car or 
by train or by truck.  Like yo
u said, you asked me how we got to Kraków, I couldn't  tell 
you.  And th e same thing now, did my  father
 leave before or after the Germans, I don 't 
reme mb er.  I don't think my  -- I don't reme mber my
 father even being in  Kraków at all.  I, 
I, I, I just --
 
Q: Okay.  That's  okay.  If someth ing comes 
to your mind, you can always tell me later.
 
A: That's n o t the most important thing if he was there or not.
 
Q: Don't w o rry, that's all right.
 

A: Okay.  All right.
 
Q: So you're in Kraków with 
your mother now at this point?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And the Germans 
come into Kraków?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And you're forced to we
ar a yellow band or a star?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And then  what happened .
 
A: Then wh at happened is that the apartm
ent below us was -- belonged to Jews and th e 
German -- what do you call that -- German mayor.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: German mayor, new mayor of Kraków was 
put into th at apartment because the people 
were furriers and they went to 
AmericA:  So the apartment was empty.  And like I said, it 
was a beautiful home, oh, gorgeous, the on
e from the furrier and good enough for the 
mayor to take it.
 
Q: You said it had belonged to Jews?
 
A: Yeah.  I don't know if the whole buildi
ng belonged to Jews, th
at apartment I know 
belonged to Jews.
 
Q: Were not living there?
 
A: That were in AmericA:
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: The couple -- and like I said, they were 
furriers and I don't know what the name was.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So th at's  unimportant too. We -- after aw
hile we were asked, not asked to move, but 
we were thrown  out of the build ing becaus
e of the Germans move
d into our apartment.
 
Q: You and your mother were thrown out?
 
A: Right.  And we were moved in to our apar
tment in a different section of town.  I can 't 
even tell you what section that was becaus
e I wasn't that fam
iliar with Kraków.
 
Q: Uhu.
 

A: And we had a small apartm
ent and we even got someth
ing on our door from the -- 
from one of the Germans whom we befriended 
from the build ing, he give us a piece of 
paper to hang on the door th at we should 
be exempt from any ratia I don't know if you 
know what ratia is.
 
Q: Yes.  Like actions?
 
A: Yeah.  Any that they co
me in and, you know, thro w 
you out again or take your 
belongings.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: We were -- at that point we were -- we ha
d that thing on the door.  Of course later on 
it didn't me an nothing.
 
Q: So you had some pr
otection in the beginning?
 
A: We had some protection in th
e beginning and that didn't la
st, of course, and we had to  
move again.  And th is time we had to move ou
tside the city of Krak
ów and my  stepfather 
was back in the mean
time, he came back.
 
Q: He came back?
 
A: He came back, yeah.  He never made it to  wh
ere we wanted to go and he came back.  I 
mean, it wasn 't just him alone, quite a few 
men tried to get away and it didn't work .
 
Q: Okay.  So he came back and was living in
 the other apartment in
 Krakówor to the 
place to the other town 
that you ha
d moved to?
 
A: No, it was like a suburb of Kraków.
 
Q: Kraków.  You don't happen to  
rememb er the name of it, do you?
 
A: No.  But I have still a little book from my
 mother that she made with addresses.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: If I only would know wh at I did with it. 
 Since I moved from my  house here to this 
small apartment I don't know where anything is
.  But should I find it, I would be able -- I 
would th ink that it mi ght be 
in there.  I don't reme mb er.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Anyhow we lived in one room, my fath er, my mother, and my
self. Out, you know, 
like in the field someplace.  We had no bathro
om. We had to go outsi
de to outdoor bath, 
and we lived with people who ow
ned that -- oh, God, it's hard
 for me to explain all that.
 
Q: It was like a build ing?
 

A: No, it was like a farmhouse.
 
Q: A farmhouse.  Ok ay.
 
A: And we lived in one of the rooms.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And the farmer lived, you kn
ow, on the premises and we 
shared that room out there 
with them.  And how lo ng did 
we live there? I don't think to
o long.  My mo ther got sick.
 
Q: While you were living in th e farmhouse?
 
A: Yes.  My mother got sick
 and she was taken to the hosp
ital and she never came back 
from the hospital.  Sh
e got blood poisoning.
 
Q: Blood poisoning?
 
A: Yes.  And passed away.
 
Q: Okay.  And you were with your stepfather?
 
A: And I'm with my stepfather.  In the me
antime, Kraków was op
ening up a ghetto and 
my stepfather did not want me to go into th
e ghetto because he had to go to work and I 
would be alone all day.
 
Q: It mu st have been hard 
for you at the time, I mean.
 
A: Oh, it was.  That's  why I don't really lik
e to talk about it becau
se it brings up, you 
know, it stirs everything up.  Like one wo man he
re tells me I 'm like an ostrich, I like to 
put my  head into th e ground because I have 
-- because there are so many bad, bad things.  
I left some out too. We tried 
to get back to Katowice and ho
w we were thrown out on the 
middle of the road, the Germans caught us, a
nd all little details whic
h would take forever 
to explain.
 
Q: Please share whatever you want to share 
because we have as mu ch time as you need .
 
A: I know but...
 
Q: I'd like to hear everything that
 you're willing to share with us.
 
A: I know but, you know, as I talk new things come up again.
 
Q: Right.  Okay .
 
A: Then I interrupt myself and what I was sa
ying and spit out the new things so I better 
forget some of the things because really it 
would take three years on th e phone, as long as 
the war was, four years.  Anyhow...
 

Q: Okay.  So you 're having a hard time at 
this point because your mo ther had passed 
away and you're living in a 
farmhouse with  your stepfath er.
 
A: Yeah.  And my stepfather 
had to register to move into
 the ghetto, which was being 
raised in Kraków for all the Je
ws to get in.  And, like I said, he -- my grandmother, in the 
meantime, and my aunt and my
 cousin, they had to leav
e Katowice because Katowice 
was made Judenfrei.
 
Q: Jewish free?
 
A: Yeah.  No Jews in Kato
wice.  That was a birthday present for Hitler from K atowice.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: That Katowice -- so my rest of my fam
ily, like I said, my gran
dmother, my  aunt, my  
cousin, they  had to go to Chrzan ów or 
Kren au.  I don't know if you heard that.
 
Q:How far is that from Katowice?
 
A: I think it would be just between, the 
middle between Katowice 
and Kraków.  I think 
maybe the middle.  I have no idea 
how many miles or a
nything.  I never...
 
Q: Do you know how 
to spell the town?
 
A: Yes.  In German it is K, like in King, 
R, like in Robert, E like in Edward, N like in 
Nelly, A like in apple, and U like in united.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And in Polish it is C like in Charles, H like
 in Harry, R like in Robert, Z like in Zebra, 
A like in apple, N like in Nelly, O like
 in orange -- Chrzanów -- I think W.
 
Q: And you believe that's somewher
e in-between Katowice and Krak ow?
 
A: Yeah.  I can look it up for you.  
I have an iP ad, I could check it out.
 
Q: We can try to find that later.
 
A: Okay.  Fine. So what my st
epfather did, he spoke to my  
aunt over the phone, I assume, 
or sent me a letter that he doesn't want me 
to go in to the ghetto and he wanted  me to be 
with my family anyway.  And so it was a
rranged that I am going to go live with my  
grandmother.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And that I did.  And that I remember I was on a train.
 
Q: A train.  By yourself?
 

A: By myself, yes.
 
Q: And how old were 
you at this point?
 
A: In 1941, 1940, I was 13.
 
Q: Thirteen.  And do you kn
ow what happened to your 
stepfather when you left?
 
A: Yes.  I know that my stepfather, since he 
came back, I was told, he
 ended up in a camp  
too.
 
Q: Okay.  So first he was 
put in the ghetto in Kraków?
 
A: He was, yeah.
 
Q: And then  was sent to a camp?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: I understand.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Now, you said you went to go live 
with your grandmot
her and your aunt?
 
A: Yeah.  My aunt, yeah
.  My mother's sister and her son, my cousin.
 
Q: On a train.  Do you reme mb er how long you travelled by train?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I don't.
 
Q: And had Nazis come to po
wer in that town as well?
 
A: Oh, Nazis were all over.  The 
Nazis took over Po land comp letely.
 
Q: Right.  So you remember the Nazis th
ere when  you went to go live with your 
grandmother and your aunt?
 
A: Yeah.  Because more or le
ss that was like a ghetto where we
 lived already.  I mean, it 
was where all the Jews lived.
 
Q: So you weren't in th
e ghetto in Kraków --
 
A: No.
 
Q: -- but you ended up being in the ghetto --
 
A: Well, it wasn't open yet on th at day.  It 
was not -- the ghetto in
 Kraków was enclosed.
 

Q: Okay .
 
A: You had to show identification papers and 
-- and -- in order to get in and out.  Where 
in Kraków -- in Chrzan ów you didn't need th
at, you ju st lived in a section wh ere all the 
Jews lived.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: But it was open.  It was such a small -- it was a tiny town. I mean, really they couldn't 
even block it off if they wanted to. And from 
there we had a lot of _____ at night -- oh, 

yeah we had an apartment,
 okay, from some subletting from somebody, from another 
man and his son, there was no wife.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And he give us one
 room.  So we were, by now we
 were my  grandmother, my  aunt, 
my cousin, and I, four 
of us in one room.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And at night, many a night 
we were woken up because we had these Germans soldiers 
they woke us up in order to 
search the rooms or wake us up 
and throw us out in the street 
for the time being and so on. An
d then we -- one night we were
 thrown out and we had to  
go on the marketplace and they 
hung somebody, and we had 
to watch it.  Because the 
man was a baker and he baked -- 
he wasn't supposed to bake, 
only  at certain hours, and 
he was caught baking like black market.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: And he was hung.  And like I said, a
ll the Jews had to go and watch that, and 
including me.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And that is another thing I will never forget.
 
Q: Do you want to take a break?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I'm all right.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then the next ratia we had we were all again on the market square and that time 

we were sorted out.  We were 
sorted into three categories:  
One, we were sent to camps; 

one could stay behind in  the same town ; and 
the third category was sent to Au schwitz.  
My aunt and my grandma c
ould still stay behind and --
 
Q: And continue living in the ghetto?
 
A: And continue living in the ghetto with my
, with my  cousin  too. And I was the one wh o 
was taken into camp, sent into concentration camp.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And that was 1940, I think.
 
Q: 1940?
 
A: '41.
 
Q: '41.  Okay.
 
A: And I was sent -- first we were in Auschwitz
 too, but not in Au sc
hwitz in the, in the 
thing, but just in Auschwitz which used to be like a stati
on where they again sorted you 
out where you going.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Anyhow I don 't think I was alone, there were a few other girls.
 
Q: You were put on a train?
 
A: We were put on a -- not a train anymore, it was now a cattle car.
 
Q: Cattle car.  Okay.
 
A: We were put into cattle cars.
 
Q: Were you allowed to 
bring an ything with you?
 
A: I think so  because I know I took my party dress.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: One suitcase.  And, of course, since I wa
s a dumb kid, I took a party dress with me, of 
course other things too but that was very  important, a party dress to take and --
 
Q: Did you know anything about wh
ere you were going at that point?
 
A: No.  No .  Nothing.  Noth ing.  Didn't know anything.  I had no -- I didn't know ab out 

camps or anything.
 
Q: So you were able to 
go back  to wh ere you were living and pack  a suitcase?
 

A: No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  
No.  I wasn't able to go ba
ck.  I don 't know how I got the 
suitcase or how I got the clothes.  If  my  a
unt has to bring it someplace, I don't know.  
But I know that I wanted that dress, that I remember, because I had 
that dress with me.  
Or maybe I could go back?  You know, 
those are the things
 I don't remember.
 
Q: Okay.  That's  okay.
 
A: I don't know if I went back because I know I 
wanted the dress. If I 
told my aunt that I -
- but I didn't see my  aunt anymore, we were se
parated.  So that wouldn't make any sense, 
would it?
 
Q: Right.
 
A: I don't know.
 
Q: So you were with all 
other women around your age?
 
A: No, I was the youngest.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I used to be very tall and 
maybe looked older than I really
 am and that actually saved 
me.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: Because, like I later found 
out, my whole family I never heard from them again.  I 
guess the next ratia they had my  aunt and my
 cousin an d my  grandmother, I never heard 
from them again, they were gone.  So
 I was the only one who survived from...
 
Q: So you were put on a cattle car --
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: -- with these other women?
 
A: Yes.  And we went to a pl
ace called -- I'll spell it for you 
-- it's  H-A, N like in Nelly, S 
like in Sam, D like in David, O like in oran
ge, R like in Robert, and F like in Frank, 
Hansdorf.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then there's a small A and a line and 
then put a line -- I don't know what you call 
these lines.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And an A -- no.  A-M, that is 
Hansdorf amdaire (sp) -- an A and a D.
 

Q: A and a D.  Okay .
 
A: Yeah.  Hansdorf --
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: It was an A and a D.  Hansdorf -- no, 
an A and an M, Hansdorf on the Marsh, the 
Marsh it's an M.
 
Q: Okay.  Hansdorf am.
 
A: Yeah.  On the marsh and that was in
 also Dayton Deutsch land th at was in 
Czechoslovakia before the German called it A u
sto (ph) Dayton they to ok it over too.
 
Q: Okay .  And how long did it take 
you to  get there, do you remember?
 
A: No.  No.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I don't.
 
Q: But do you rememb er
 it being a long trip?
 
A: I don't remember that either.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I really don't.  I only know that that's  
where we arrived. And 
we were 150 wo men and 
we had barracks, which were really not as 
bad as my  next stop. 
 We had barracks and 
bunk beds, there was even a st
ove in the middle which -- and there was a big factory right 
next to th e barracks and we started wo rking 
in  the factory that was spinning, spinnery , 
but spinnery  is not what people 
think, we were making thread.
 
Q: Thread?  Okay.
 
A: From flax.  Yeah.  And I was servicing 
the machines about 150 -- oh, maybe not that 
many, I don't rememb er exactly how many spools
 on the machine.  An
d if they needed -- 
once the spools filled up, you had to take th
em off and put empty spools on again, and 
that's what we used to do. And I mu st ha
ve been mo re ambitious because I wanted a 
machine, I wanted to run a 
machine.  I didn 't  want to
 be running fro
m ma ch in e to  
machine.  So eventu
ally I qualified to run my own machine.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I was very proud of my self so...
 
Q: So that was in a factory, like 
you were living in barracks at night?
 

A: We were.  Yeah.
 
Q: And then  you were taken to a factory in the mo rning?
 
A: No.  It was right actually next door.  The ba
rracks were put up so that you really didn't 
have to, you just walked but of course you had guards.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: You had live-in guards so, and when  we want
ed to write a letter to
 our family, if we 
work ed, for instance, after hours in the field 
-- we work ed 12 hours, from 6:00 to 6:00.  
And then  if you -- in summertime if you wanted
 to wo rk in the fields, we would get to 
write a letter. And then the wo
rst thing, which I do remember, 
is that they took us to a 
basement.  People had potatoes 
in the baseme nts, you know, 
by th e bushel.  I don't -- are 
you anything -- are you anything fa
miliar with Germany at all?
 
Q: Yes, a bit.  A bit.
 
A: But you don't know
 how people lived?
 
Q: Not exactly, no.
 
A: No.
 
Q: But describe it to me the best that you rememb er.
 
A: Okay.  Well, in the basement peop
le used  to stock 
up with potatoes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And the potatoes, many times, if the winter 
wasn't that cold, star
ted rotting away.  And 
from rotting away you had thousa
nds and thousands of little flies.  Y ou know those food 
flies?
 
Q: Food flies.
 
A: Yeah.  And they needed th
ose basements cleaned out and we had to do it.  And the 
_____+ basement and I 
would never forget that was the 
worst stench and the worst thing 
because whatever you did you 
couldn't even breathe because those flies were all over 
you. And I hate, I hate little things that crawl 
or fly from that day on.
  I would always say 
I'd rather have an elephant coming towards 
me than anything that crawls or flies little 
because of those damn flies.  I can  still feel th
em and see them.  So th
at's what you had to 
do too and --
 
Q: So that was -- sometimes they made
 you do other wo rk besides the flax?
 
A: Right.  If you wanted to have a privilege 
of writing.  Well, with the potatoes there was 
no -- you had to do it.  There was no asking y
ou if you want to or don't want to.  They  

never ask you if you want to or don't want to
.  They  didn't.  You did it.  But sometimes 
you got, you know, you got curb  (ph) fo r it, 
like a letter to write or sometimes you got 
nothing.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So that was not the worst camp really, that was really because the accommodations 
were horrible, I mean, they we
re bad enough but not horrible.
 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the barra
cks that you  stayed in with the other 
women?
 
A: Yeah.  Well, the barracks were fairly -- th
ey were new actually. 
 They were a light 
wood.  They were -- we had bunkers and we
 had -- we slept on wo od and hay, like hay 
stuff, but at least it was clean in there and 
there was some heat.  I don't rememb er the 
bathroom facilities anymore in that particular
 place, I do not remember them.  But they 
couldn't have been too bad because it didn'
t make any impression on me.  Where the 
other camp I was in, I rememb er those vividly.
 
Q: Now, all of the women that you had come
 with from your gran dmother's town on th e 
cattle cart, were you all together in th
e barracks and working in the factories?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Or was there some sort of se
lection process when  you got there?
 
A: No.  There was -- there was -- some mi
ght have gone further to another camp and 
some might have gone to another factory.  No
t everybody came to be -- were al l together, 
no.
 
Q: Okay.  I'm sorry to -- can I go back for one minute?
 
A: Yes, please.
 
Q: Can you just tell me a little 
bit about the conditio
ns of the cattle car on your way to the 
camp?
 
A: The cattle car, the cattle car 
is -- what conditions do you 
want?  We were like cattle.  
We were -- we had no room to breathe because 
there were more people
, it wasn't just the 
women from, from, from Chrzanów.
 
Q: Chrzanów.
 
A: There were other people too from other little c ities.  W e were all -- that's what I said, 
we all met in Auschwitz in -- like I said, it wasn't --
 
Q: In the station?
 

A: Yes, where people got togeth
er like -- what did you call it?
 
Q: You had called it I think befo re a station.
 
A: Well, like an assembly hall, let's say.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .
 
A: Like everybody was assemb led in that s
pot and then we were put into, I guess, 
different categories.  You know
, they had other factories t
oo, not only where I worked.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: Other factories were some people used to 
work  in the fence and I don't know what else 
the Germans used you for.  Bu
t like I said, I can 't think no
w what everybody wo rked  and 
I only know what we worked in.
 
Q: Right.  Right. And what kind of clothes 
did you wear while you were there?  Did they 
give you like a unifo rm?
 
A: No.  I don't think so.  I, I 
really honestly don't think so.
 
Q: Okay.  And did you still have your belongin
gs at this point, like 
the little suitcase that 
you had with  your party dress or had 
that been  taken way from you by now?
 
A: No, I think I still had it.  Because I know wh
en I came back in 1945
 when I came back 
to Katowice, I wore my winter coat because I was so skinny.  The 
kids used to call me 
that I looked like a herring.  They used to call 
me herring, that was like an insu lt.  So I 
didn't  want to go without a co at.  So I mu st have kept my  clothes because I reme mb er the 
winter coat.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .
 
A: I know I had jewelry, wh ich I got my  
ring from my mother, and the first one to -- 
when  they  called you have to give things up
, I was they used to 
say ukopods (ph) and 
_____+ they  -- used to call me ukopods (ph) 
because I used to be the German and, you 
know, everybody else was Polish.
 
Q: Rights.
 
A: So I was the first one in line to return stuff.
 
Q: Okay .  And you had said that you were ma
king thread out of spools of flax.  What 

kind of hours did you work  in the factory?
 
A: From 12:00 to 12:00.
 
Q: 12:00 to 12:00?
 

A: Twelve hours.  Not 12:00 to  12:
00, from 6:00 to 6:00 for 12 hours.
 
Q: 6:00 to 6:00?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay .  And wh at kind of meals did you have?
 
A: I know we got black coffee in
 the morning.  I know we we
re always hungry.  We got -
- I rememb er the soups that was if you kn
ew the person who was dispensing the soup, 
you might have gotten a potato in
 the water that they called 
soup or you got just water 
with a little bit of potato flavor.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: And then you got -- I rememb
er you got, you had one round 
loaf and at first it was cut 
into four so each one got a quarter of that 
round loaf.  I think it must have been a two 
pound loaf. And then later on in the years, as
 supplies got more skimpy, we only got then 
it was cut into an eighth of a loaf.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So if you were able to keep it and ju st ha
ve a bite, good, but I couldn't .  So I ate it all 
up and th en I had to wait for the next portion.  
And I think that was, in the last few years I 
think that was for three days.
 
Q: And you said that there were guar
ds watching you in  the factory all day?
 
A: Yes.  We had guards standing in  the entr
ance in each entrance of the particular 
division where we were working.
 
Q: Okay.  And what were they like?
 
A: It was women.  You know, women with wo men is not good.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: Because these were girls 
who were nothing 
and now they were bi
g shots because they 
had the face of, you know, wh at to do. But that camp wasn 't as bad so I won't even say 
anything about this camp.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: It was -- since I have a comp arison between 
fair and terrible, I will leave it for the next 
camp.
 
Q: Okay .  But you were still hungry often?
 
A: Oh, yeah.
 

Q: And there were guards.  Were there any men at your camp?
 
A: No.  I wo rked  in two wo men camps, only women.
 
Q: And were there any sort of like cultural 
or religious activities goi
ng on in the camp?
 
A: No.  No.  No.  No.  Nope.
 
Q: Okay .  And were there other women in  
the camp from different countries who maybe 
spoke different languages 
also working with you?
 
A: Not in this camp.  This was a small, a
bout like 150 women, which is considered very  
small .
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: And one more thing, I was 
in -- they had rabbits in th
e outside, they  had like a thing 
built for rabbits in them, like st
alls, little stalls.  And I becam
e the rabbit moth
er to feed 
the rabbits.
 
Q: Okay.  You were taking care of the rabbits?
 
A: Yeah.  I had to feed them.  And I used to
 pick up the food for them and there were a 
lot of potato peels.  Those poor rabbits, they
 got thinner and thinner, because I ate up all 
the potato skins.
 
Q: Right.  And was that a job that
 you did besides the factory wo rk?
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There was just adde
d little things. Everybody 
had so mething to do 
there, either sweep the barracks or, you 
know, everybody had to
 do a little bit to 
participate in keeping th e 
barracks fairly, you know --
 
Q: In order?
 
A: Fairly in order, right.
 
Q: And did you meet any friends
 while you were at this camp?
 
A: I knew one girl that I rememb er her, sh
e was from t h e same ci t y  but she was older 
than I.  We were all -- most of the girls were
 all older, they were a
ll 17, 18, and I wasn't 
even 14 yet.
 
Q: And how did the other prisoners 
-- how did you all treat each other?
 
A: Oh, we treated each other good.  I 
mean, we had no qu
arrels or anything.
 
Q: Okay .
 

A: We were -- in the same experience for ev
erybody, you know, we were all in the same 
boat.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So we were --
 
Q: And you were in this 
camp, you said, for two years?
 
A: Around two years.  
Year and a half maybe.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .
 
A: You know, time is really -- you had no time.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: You didn't know wh at -- you 
didn't know what was happening 
on the outside, at least I 
didn't .  We had no radios.  We had nobody to
 bring us any news fro
m the outside.  So you 
were isolated. You had no watches --
 
Q: Right.
 
A: -- no calendars, nothing.
 
Q: And is there anything else about this ca
mp or the fact, you know, or the area where 
you wo rk ed, anything else that you want to 
share about it?  Anything else you reme mb er 
specifically ?
 
A: It was a very pretty area, 
that's all I know.  Because when
 we went out in the fields, 
very pretty.  Very bright and it was like a countryside.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: A country where we were.  And I cannot think 
of the name of it.  Well, I told you, that 
was Hansdorf on the Marsh.  You asked me
 for another name, what was it, which I 
couldn't rememb er?  Oh, yeah, the city wh er
e we were where they threw us out from 
Kraków, wh en we lived in -- th
at's the place that I have to
 check.  I don't know if I --
 
Q: Where the farmhouse was.
 
A: Yeah, right.  We lived in one room.
 
Q: Do you know, do you know 
the name -- I know you had said the name of the camp , do 
you know where, where that was? 
 What was like the closest city?
 
A: No.  That I don't know.
 
Q: Okay .  But it was Hansdorf?
 

A: Hansdorf on the Marsh.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: It must have been a river.  Hansdorf and 
Marsh is river, so Hansdorf on the river.  On 
certain -- on that river.
 
Q: Okay.  And where were your guards from?
 
A: I have no ideA:  I don't know.
 
Q: But what language were they speaking?
 
A: German.
 
Q: German.  Okay.  And you didn't have any 
sort of contact with people outside of the 

camp, right?
 
A: No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  We were not -- 
they were not allowed to
 talk to us and we 
weren't allo wed, certainly not, to talk to them.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So, no, you don't ha
ve any, no contact.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then  one night, again one evening, they
 told us to take ou
r belongings, whatever 
we had.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: And we were put again on a 
cattle train and we were riding in the unknown again.  We 
were going.
 
Q: Everybody in the whole camp was 
taken away or just certain people?
 
A: No.  Everybody in the wh
ole bunk, the camp  was being dissolved  and we are going 
someplace else.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And we ended up in hell on eart
h.  We ended up in Trautenau.
 
Q: Can you spell that for me?
 
A: Yeah.  T like in Tom, R like in Robert, A like in apple -- I have to write it out because 

I don't think I can --
 
Q: That's o k ay.
 

A: I should have done it before because I'm --
 
Q: That's o k ay.  Don't 
worry.  Take your time.
 
A: Wait a minute.  I need a piece of paper to
o.  I don't know if I'
m spelling it right.  I 
should have -- T-R-A, T like in Tom -- I don'
t think I'm giving you 
the right spelling of 
that --
 
Q: Okay .  We can come back to it if you'd like.
 
A: In Polish -- in Czech I can give it to you, I think, better.
 
Q: That's o k ay.  You can do it that way if you'd like.
 
A: It's T like in topple, R like in Robert, O lik
e in orange, T like in Tom, U like in united, 
O like in orange, and V like in victory.
 
Q: Trutnov.  Okay.  And how long -- actually, 
first of all, do you know wh en this was, 
like what month or year?
 
A: No.  The year I'm not sure. 
 It mu st have been maybe 1942.
 
Q: Okay.  1942.  And do you 
remember like what season it was?
 
A: I think it was cold.
 
Q: Maybe winter?
 
A: It mu st have been Novemb er, yeah
.  It was very co
ld there anyway.
 
Q: And you were taken by cattle cart there a
nd do you remember how long the ride was?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: No, because, you know, you d
on't care how long th e ride is
, you just want to get there.
 
Q: Right, of course.
 
A: And everything seemed like fo
rever, which I'm sure it wasn 't.
 
Q: Okay.  So you were taken there to --
 
A: Because I checked it out, that I have
 checked out, and the distances don't look 
tremendous.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Okay.  There we were put into an old factory that was not in use.
 

Q: What happened when you firs
t -- I'm sorry to go back -- 
what happened wh en you first 
got off the cattle cart?
 
A: We marched.
 
Q: Were you separated into separate groups?
 
A: We marched.  No, we were all the same 1
50 girls that left from there, from Hansdorf, 
and we were marching to
wards our new quarters.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Which, like I said, was an old factory no
t in use with windows 
-- no windows in them, 
in some, not all, dilapidated, terrible, that was our new home.
 
Q: Okay .  And do you have any id ea -- was Tr
autenau the name of the camp or was it in a 
specific town or city?
 
A: No, Trautenau is a city.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .
 
A: And Trautenau is by -- by -- is Trautena
u by -- oh, God, I'm trying to  think -- no.  
Trautenau, actually we were not in
 Trautenau, Trautenau is a city.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And we were in -- we were next to Traute
nau and th at is -- I can't think of the name 
now, of the place.  You have to give
 me a little time, it slipped my mind.
 
Q: Okay .  No problem.  
We'll try to come back to
 it when it comes to mind.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay.  So you got off th
e cattle cart and you were ma
rched to this old abandoned 
factory.
 
A: Right.  And that's where we had -- God, 
I can 't -- there were -- the hall, place where 
we walked in, there were all 
-- not bunk -- not double beds
, just single, single bunkers.
 
Q:Okay.
 
A: The whole thing full of them.  One after a
nother.  And again straw, straw things with  
like a sack filled with straw and I don't know
 with what we covered ourself.  I don't 
remember if there was a cover 
on or not.  I can't rememb er
 that.  Parshnitz, that's the 
name of where we were.
 
Q: Okay .  Next to Trautenau?
 

A: Yeah, Parshnitz by Trautenau.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: You know how to  spell that?
 
Q: No, I would love for you to spell it for me, please.
 
A: Okay.  It's P like in Peter, A like in appl
e, R like in Robert, S like in Sam, H like in 
Harry, N like in Nelly, I like in Ida, and T like 
in Tom, and Z, I think there's a Z at the 
end like in ZebrA:
 
Q: Parshnitz?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay.  So tell me 
more about the factory.
 
A: Okay.  So, No. 1, we ha
d no bathroom faci
lities except open stalls.  And when you 
went to the bathroom, there wa
s a line in front of you waiting to take the next seat but 
you had no privacy whatsoever. 
 I mean really , so that was getting used -- I mean, you 
have people standing right on
 top of you waiting fo r you 
to get -- that was terrib ly 
dehumanizing.  We had no hot water, only 
cold water.  No toothbrush es, no nothing 
because --
 
Q: So anything you had taken with you
 from the old camp  you no longer had?
 
A: Yes.  We had the clothing, I think. 
 Because, like I said, that coat was --
 
Q: The winter coat, rig h t.
 
A: Yeah.  So  I mu st have had some clothing 
with me.  But I don't think we were wearing 
clothing there, our clothing.  I thi
nk we wore a uniform in this camp.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .
 
A: I can 't remember.  Don't forget it's 60 years later.
 
Q: Yes, of course.  No.  You're doing great
.  Whatever, whatever 
co mes to mi nd you let 
me know.
 
A: Okay.  Well, that was -- like 
I said, that was a terrib le plac
e.  I did the same thing like 
I did in the other, in the other factory.
 
Q: Making the thread?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Okay .
 

A: And I did -- again I had my  own machine.
 
Q: Were you wo rking in  the sa
me place that you were living?
 
A: No.  No.  We had --
 
Q: So you were living in the old factory bu
t they brought you some
where else to work?
 
A: Exactly.  They took us to
 a factory th at was working.
 
Q: Was it close by to where you were living?
 
A: No, we had to march over there ever
y morning thro ugh ice and snow or not.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: We were, we were -- now we were more pe
ople.  This was a camp for 2,000 people.  
From 150 we were 2,000,
 and we had 500, I understand, Hungarian women from 
Auschwitz that came that were there too in our camp.
 
Q: Okay.  And where were the other 
people from besides Auschwitz and --
 
A: Mostly from Poland, they'r
e mo stly Polish people.  You se
e what they did too is that 
from Poland they sent the pe
ople to Czechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia they sent 
the people from Poland or Germany, because th
ey didn't  want you to run into  anybody 
familiar.  Like let's say you would know a 
guard or something, th
is way you didn't know 
anybody because you came from different parts of
 the country , of the countries.  I think 
that was the main objective.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So now we had guards that
 were standing in front inside the barracks -- not barracks, 
we weren't in a barracks -- inside our sl
eeping quarters and we 
were counted every 
morning, like when we went to
 work.  And if it -- if someb
ody was missing, we would be 
standing in the cold 
in wintertime, of course, forever and the day until 
they found the 
person th at was missing -- and I'm jump ing again.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: But it's really -- where we lived was hell, th
at's what I told you. 
 And the guards, when 
we wanted to go to the bathro
om, we had to  excuse ourselves.  And if the guard s said, no, 
you can't go right now, we couldn't go.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So we had to --
 
Q: Okay .  Did you also have 
guards in your sleeping quarters?
 

A: Not in the sleeping quarters in  the factory, in the entrance a
nd exits in the factory.  So 
if you wanted to leave your post and go to
 the bathroom, you just couldn't do it without 
asking th e guard  who was standing
 between you and the bathroom.
 
Q: Okay .  And the guar
ds again spoke German?
 
A: The guards spoke German. 
 Maybe they  spoke Po lish too or Czech, I don't know.  I 
spoke fluently Germany so for me it was, 
you know, no -- I had no problem speaking 
German so I...
 
Q: And the factory that were working -- 
you were those 150 wo men and then  mo re 
people from the camp ?
 
A: More people from different places that were sent there too.
 
Q: Right.  Right.
 
A: So it made -- like I said, we were 2,000 people among the factory.
 
Q: Okay .  And can you tell me ab
out your meals at this place?
 
A: My meals, what meals?
 
Q: Right.
 
A: We used to say, "Too much 
to die from and too little to live on."
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So it was a starvation diet.  It really 
was.  And I don't know
 how mu ch longer, you 
know, we could have done it.  Because we were all losing our strength.  Because if you 
don't get en ough nourishment and all you do 
is work....  Unfo rtunately I was in my 
growing stages and th at's why I have so ma
ny hang ups right now, I think.  Maybe I 
would have had those anyway but
 I'm blaming everything on 
these years whatever I have.
 
Q: Right.  I understand.  Did y
ou make any friends in this camp ?
 
A: Friends, I made friends.  A girlfriend that I, 
to this day we are in touch, when I was in 
Chrzanów, in Krenau  with my  grandmother -- I'm going back wards.
 
Q: That's o k ay.
 
A: I made friends with her and 
sh e's in Australia and we are --
 
Q: But she wasn't sent 
to these camps with you?
 
A: No, no.  We met after the war.
 

Q: Okay .  And wh at else can you tell me 
about this camp Trau tenau?  Was it very 
crowded?
 
A: Well, yeah, it was crowded because all we 
had is bunk beds -- they're not bunk beds.  I 
always say bunk beds, they'r
e not.  One bunk bed, single.
 
Q: Right, single beds.
 
A: Yeah, and th at was what the whole thing wa
s, just beds.  And an entrance to that 
bathroom where they  stood in line in front of
 you or I stood in line in front of them, 
whoever was on the potty.  And th ere was no, no
thing else, except cold
.  It was cold in 
there because I think the factory was cold an
yway because of the fl
ooring, stone flooring 
and no heat. And, yeah, you know 
what I forget to tell you, that I was in England too.  
But I can't  -- you know somethi
ng, it really -- my life is so, 
there is so much more.  I 
forgot to tell you after I came back in from th
e -- oh, that is really later.  What am I 
saying?
 
Q: Later, we'l l get to that.  We'll get 
to that.  That's  after the war.  Right?
 
A: Yes.  Are you going to be with
 me on the phone 
till tomorrow morning?
 
Q: Don't worry.
 
A: Really it's too -- I talk 
too too much.  I maybe should
 cut it shorter a little bit 
because...
 
Q: I think you're doing fine, but
 if you feel like you want to
 stop or take a break, that's 
okay.  Wh atever work s for you.
 
A: What time is it now?
 
Q: It's 3:10.
 
A: 3:10.  Another half an hour 
but that's  going to be it then.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .  No problem.
 Okay.  So we're still talk i
ng about this camp.  In this 
camp, where you said there were so many peop
le, were there men in this camp or still 
only women?
 
A: Only  women.
 
Q: Only  women.  Okay.
 
A: We had men one time -- towards the end of 
the war, they were di
ssolving camps.  You 
know, we weren't that far from th e Brzeznica
, to get you an idea, you know what the 
Brzeznica?
 
Q: Yes, of course.
 

A: So we were not too far from the Brzeznica, 
that's a vicinity at 
least from Parshnitz and 
Trautenau is, and before the end of the war 
they were dissolving camp s and we had the 
transport co ming th rough with  only men.  
And we didn't want -- I don't know, th e British 
-- I was lib erated by the Russians.  That ca
mp, where they had th
e men coming thro ugh -- 
I don't know who would have liberated them 
-- but to tell you these men could hardly  

walk, they  were dying.  They  were dying by 
the hundreds.  And they came overnight to 

park their bodies in our camp.  And in th
e morning, when we woke up there was like a 
wagon fu ll with corp ses of men lying outside
 and on th e wagon, an d they pushed  these 
men further and further to walk because th
ey didn't  want them
 to be liberated.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And that was the only time 
we had men in the -- hardly  men because they were mo re 
dead than alive.  
It was incredible.
 
Q: And so all your guards
 were also again wo men?
 
A: Yes, except the guards on 
the outside.  Like we had like in prison they have these 
patrol things, they were normal l
ooking, and those were men, I think.
 
Q: Okay .  And were those Nazi personnel?
 
A: That I cannot tell you.  I had no contact
 with anybody except 
for the women to ask 
them if I'm allowed to go 
to  the bathroom or not.
 
Q: Okay .  And the prisoners, the other wo me
n who were with you,
 did you treat each 
other well at that time as well?
 
A: Well, I think the Hungarian and the people  from -- that were not from Hungary, I don't 
think they liked each other too 
much, why I could not tell you.
 
Q: Okay.  Okay.  But you sens
ed some tension between them?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Then we had lice sections where 
we all were -- I mean, infections.
 
Q: Lice.
 
A: We were, a bunch of wo man, we were disrobe
d.  Wh atever we had 
on, we had to give 
u p .   T h ey  sh av ed  
our heads and to check us for lice.  We were defumed --
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: -- of lice.  And we had no -- they took our 
hair off -- oh, that was wonderful too, that 
was another wonderful experience. And there 
was another incident which was horrible 

when  we were all sittin g naked around, and ju
st to think ab out it make me shudder. And 
so that was -- what else wo
uld you like to know about th
at camp  which was a horrible 
camp?
 
Q: Was there ever a time
 there that you got sick?
 
A: You didn't want to get sick because if 
you got sick and you couldn't work, they had 
every months transported, transports that 
picked you up and you 
were gone and never 
heard of again.  So you really didn't want to get sick.
 
Q: So so mehow you managed to get up and go to wo rk  every day?
 
A: Yeah.  And like I said to 
you, we got too much to die 
from and too little to exist from.
 
Q: Did anyone ever escape from the camp?
 
A: I don't think so.  People had no energy. 
 They had no, no streng
th to go anywhere.  
Maybe that's why th ey kept us so -- and the 
guards all over, and lights, and they had these 
beamers going.  I don't think so .  I don't re
memb er.  Don't forget, 2,000 women you can't 
know what everybody's doing.
 
Q: Right.  Of course.  Of course.  And you 
didn't have any contact with anyone outside of 
the camp, right?
 
A: Not from that camp, no, no.
 
Q: Right.  And did you know 
anything about what was going on, sort of in the outside 
world?
 
A: In the first camp we heard that the Eng
lish or the Americans -- I don 't think America 
was yet in the war when we were there.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: We heard a little, b u t in the second camp 
we didn't h ear nothing, we didn't know 
anything.
 
Q: And were there any sort of like executions 
or killings that went 
on while you were in 
the camp?
 
A: No.  I didn't see anybody being executed.  
No.  Like I said, we had these transports 
and they  picked up th e people who weren't 
productive anymore and I think those were 
sent to Auschwitz.
 
Q: So whoever, whoever didn't make it it was 
because of hunger or, or they got sick?
 
A: Or being sick, right.
 

Q: Okay .
 
A: Exactly.  And they -- 
that's why people didn't want to ge
t sick or didn't  let th emselves 
be sick.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: You know, you push and push till you really drop dead, pr
actically, because otherwise 
you wouldn't dare.
 
Q: Right.  Is there anything else you reme
mb er that you want to share about this camp?
 
A: No.  I was wishing for so
mebody to  come and get us out
 of there not knowing who to 
wish for, or who was in the war or not.
 
Q: Right.  And you were in this camp for how long?
 
A: To the last day of war, the 8th of May, 19
45.  The last of last days.  That is the 
official, I think the 8th of May is the o
fficial date when the war really ended.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: And that's the date when
 the Russians liberated us.
 
Q: So before you were liberated did 
you know that that ti me was coming?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did anything chan ge in the camp  in the days prior?
 
A: Yes.  They kept -- th
e guards were all gone.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: All the guard s, from outside and in
side.  And we knew something was up.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Because that was a -- that
 was the telltale that some
thing was going 
on.  Who is 
coming or what is coming or why is it comi
ng, we didn't know.  Bu t we knew, you know, 
that there is some
thing better ahead.
 
Q: Okay.  So you 
said May 8, 1945?
 
A: Yeah.  Like I said, the la
st, the very, very last day.
 
Q: So what happened  on th at day?
 
A: On that day the Russians came.
 
Q: Okay .
 

A: And of course we couldn'
t communicate with them because nobody sp oke Ru ssian.  
And we were very happy.  I mean, you know, we were jubila
nt that we have -- that the 
Germans are gone.  That we ar
e free, that mu ch we knew.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And what some of the wo men did, they  we
nt to town -- they go
t their strength, they 
ate -- first o f all, everybody ate and ate, wh
atever the Russians brought us.  And then of 
course a lot of people got sick because their 
stomach couldn't  take what -- to digest all 
that food.  And then  the women who had mo re 
strength, or some of them, they went to 
town , to Trautenau, and I understand th ey sm
ash all the windows, the store fronts, and 
were -- what do you call that, tak ing merchandise?
 
Q: Looting.
 
A: Yes, they were looting the stores, which rea
lly wasn 't  very great, 
but that's  what they 
did.  And the Ru ssians, of course, helped 
them.  Maybe they went
 with the Russians on 
their Jeeps. I don't know how th ey got downtown, 
but they did.  And I had to  go to bed.  I 
went to bed because I was so
 weak that I just let go.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So from May till I think August I didn't 
go back to my home town because I just 
couldn't.  I had to recuperate, but anyhow...
 
Q: So where did you recuperate?
 
A: In, in -- over there, I stayed in the camp.
 
Q: Oh, okay.
 
A: To get some strength back .
 
Q: And how did the Ru ssians treat you?
 
A: They treated us right, I think.  I, you 
know, I don 't know.  I 
understand there were 
some rapes too.  Of course nobody, you know
, I didn't have that problem because nobody 
would ev en look at me twice, never mind once.
  And I was so dumb.  I was so naive.  I 
didn't  even know wh at was going on in  cam
p, women between wo men, I had no -- I 
swear to you I had no idea that
 something like this existed.
  I was a very dumb, young 
woman -- young girl, I wasn't a woman.
 
Q: You had said that you were also younger
 than mo st of the women who were there?
 
A: Yes, I was.  I was always the younges
t because I was one of the youngest taken.
 
Q: So you stayed there un
til August with the Russians?
 

A: Yeah, and let them feed me and actually --
 
Q: You got your energy back ?
 
A: Got my energy back.  An
d then again cattle car becaus
e, you know, we had no other 
transportation but cattle cars, they wouldn't  
take us and we had 
no money to  pay for 
anything.
 
Q: So the Russians to ok you by cattle car?
 
A: No.  We just took a cattle car.  They  -- no
t the Russians didn't ta
ke us but we got a 
certificate from the camp who took ov
er the director for the camp.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: He give us a certificate that we spent,
 you know, so mu ch time in the camp and to  
please give us, you know, mo re or less a courte
sy, show us some courtesy and that same 
piece of paper we travelled with be
cause we had no ot
her identification.
 
Q: And you decided to 
go back to  Katowice?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And another two wo men, sisters who lived  
outside of Katowice, we
re with me on that 
particular trip back to Katowice.
 
Q: And why did you want to go back there?
 
A: Because I thought maybe so
mebody from my family is 
back.  You know, I didn't  
know that nobody is going to be back.
 
Q: Right.  Right.
 
A: And that's the only place I 
knew, where I grew up.  I knew my mother wouldn't be 
there.  But, you know, my  aunt, I thou
ght somebody's going to , my  cousin  maybe.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Of course nobody was back and I didn't 
know what to do with myself.  And those two 
ladies were nice enough and they said they were going 
to take me home with them.
 
Q: The ladies that had travelled with you?
 
A: Yeah, they were travelling.  They came
 from camp too but they  were more mature 
women th an I was and 
they knew exac
tly where they were going.
 
Q: Okay .  And did you regist
er when you got to Katowice?
 

A: Yeah.  I went to the 
Jewish, to the Jewish --
 
Q: Registry?
 
A: -- registry and I registered.  And of co
urse I was looking fo r somebody that I knew 
from my family, of course.  Like I said to 
you befo re, nobody was there.  And I thought 
I'll go back to the train and I thro w my self und
er the train, really 
because I didn't know 
what to do.  Every
body -- Katowice was normal already because Katowice was liberated 
in January .
 
Q: So mo re time had gone by?
 
A: Yeah, had gone by.  And they were 
back to  normal, you know, wh at normal was.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And here I didn't k n ow where to go.  My  grandmother had a house in Po land th at she 

owned.  Not a house, an apartment building bu
t there was strange people living in there, I 
didn't  know anybody.  And like I said, if not
 for the two women th
at took me, I would 
have not known wh at to do with  my self.
 
Q: Okay .  So you went with them?
 
A: So I went with them and maybe thre
e weeks later, or some
thing like that, my 
stepfather came.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: He survived the war.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: And he went to the Jewish welfare, what
ever that was where I registered, and found 
out where I was and came over there.  And of 
course I was very, very happy to  see him.
 
Q: I'm sure.
 
A: And he then took me away from those la
dies and we were together.  And we built -- 
and we lived in a, got a room togeth er.  
And I don't know if it was my grandma's home, 
but I don't think there was anything open, if 
he decided to evacuate, I don't know th at.  I 
don't -- like I said, I don't know how but we were
 together and how long, not even a year, 

because there was a lady who 
lived in my grandmother'
s house and she -- and my 
stepfather and her became friendly, and then
 my  stepfather had his sister living in 
London, England.
 
Q: A sister, okay.
 
A: His siste r.
 

Q: His siste r.
 
A: The one that was with the factory, 
with  the soap factory, her husband --
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: -- owned the soap  factory.
 
Q: Oh, th e one that you had moved into th eir apartment?
 
A: Yeah.  That's right.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: There was a children transport going to 
London from Katowice, 
 and my  au nt in 
London arranged for me 
to come as a domestic.
 
Q: Why did you -- why did your stepfather wa
nt to send you to  England as opposed to 
staying there with him?
 
A: Because he felt I had no future.  The Russi
ans were there and  he figured I will have 
no future in Poland.  He said if I g o  to Engl
and, it's  going to be more of a future for me 
than in Poland. And ev
entually he got married
 to that lady and I think maybe they wanted 
me out.  That I realized later on when I got 
a little wiser that maybe 
they felt it would be 
better for me not to be there.
 
Q: Do you know when this was?
 
A: When that was when I got to England?
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: In 1946.
 
Q: Okay .  So  you weren't in Katowice that long --
 
A: No.
 
Q: -- before going to  London?
 
A: No.  I went to London.
 
Q: So so meone was arranging a transport?
 
A: Yeah.  It came from London fro
m a Dr. Schonfeld, I remember --
 
Q: Doctor who?  Can you spell that for me?
 
A: I hope that's the rig h t name.  He wa
s -- he worked for th
e -- for one of the 
organizations and he 
arranged th e transport.
 

Q: Okay .
 
A: That was actually a children transportand for that transport I was already old.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Because at that time I think I was already 
18.  In 1945, I was 18.  Right.  And those 
were all smaller kids.  Like I said, it was 
a ch ildren transport but somehow I got on it.
 
Q: And what was the name of the doctor ag ain?  I'm sorry.
 
A: I think Schonfeld, something like that.
 
Q: Schonfeld.  Okay.
 
A: Something.  Yeah .  Don't hol
d me to exactly information --
 
Q: Okay .  No problem.
 
A: Because I even have pictures from the boat
 where he is on because we docked right at 
the London Bridge in London
.  London Tower, London Bridge
.  London Tower.  I don't 
think there's a bridge 
called London Tower but --
 
Q: Tower of London?
 
A: Yeah.  We came right into
 London.  Docked right into
 London, in main London.
 
Q: Okay .  How was that trip?
 
A: It was another disappointment because here
 I was and I thought everybody is going to 
say, oh th at poor girl, look at wh at she did 
-- had gone through in her young life.  And I 

be -- everybody going to feel 
sorry for me.  Aye-yi-yi did I 
get a rude awaken ing.  My  
aunt, I mean, my step-aunt actually, really she 
said as domestic and that's what I became.
 
Q: Mm-hmm.
 
A: And I mo st normally didn't have the best
 of manners and sh e was a stickler for 
manners, which maybe was good becaus
e I learned quite a bit from her.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: But it was a hard life.  It 
really was a rude awakening. 
 And she had a friend, a young 
woman who lived in  the same building, and 
I could hear comp laining ab out me.  And I 
was so lonely and I was so unhappy but I grew  up.
 
Q: Right.  Did you stay in 
contact with your step-father?
 

A: Yes.  I stayed in contact with my step-fa
ther and as a matter of fact, she was the one 
who wrote a lot, long, long letters because
 we didn't have iPhone or T-phones or 
whatever.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Like we have now.
 
Q: And did you go to school wh ile  you were living with your aunt?
 
A: I went to the Northwest Polytechnic at ni
ght and guess what I to
ok up?  Instead of 
learning how to speak Eng
lish, I took up Russian.
 
Q: Wow.  Why did you decide to do th at?
 
A: Because I thought it so close to 
Polish that it's going to be easy.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: That was my thinking, very smart.  But I 
didn't take up English.  I learned English.  
Maybe not a hundred  -- I mean, I'm not really that fluent because I have wo rd s missing 
but my  age has somethi
ng to do with it too.
 
Q: Now, your English, yo
ur English is very good.
 
A: Yes.  Well, I worked -- after a couple of 
years with my aunt, I learned enough English 
that I went and looked for a job.
 
Q: Did she have other 
-- did she have children?
 
A: She had one son who lived in  Manchest
er, he was attending th e Univ ersity of 
Manchester.
 
Q: So he wasn't living 
in her house with you?
 
A: No.  He came to visit someti
me s and he was my  first love to
o, really.  So that, that was 
that.
 
Q: It mu st have been 
hard, you know, at first not speaking th e language.
 
A: Yes, it was.
 
Q: You know, was there any sort of discrimination or --
 
A: No.
 
Q: -- other problems you had?
 

A: No.  I had problems.  Like I joined a club 
too, I don 't know whic
h club I joined in.  I 
don't think it was BacopA:  I don't reme mb er. 
 You know, the people went out at night 
and there were a lot of foreigners 
in that club, not all British people.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And everybody was jabbering 
away and I was sitting there, I didn't know one thing.  I 
didn't  -- I couldn't participate.  And I loved to
 talk, as you have noticed.  I came back and 
I was again, you know, so frustrating to  be ou
t with people and not, not to be able to 
participate.
 
Q: Right.  Of course.
 
A: But I did learn and I did make up fo r it and th
at is part of my life, that was part of 
growing up for me.
 
Q: So how long were you livin
g with your aunt in England?
 
A: Until 1951.
 
Q: '51?
 
A: From _____+ --
 
Q: Okay.  So like five years?
 
A: Yeah.  And I came -- I was dating a young 
man there for about two and a half years 
and -- but now I have to tell you 
quickly how I came to AmericA:
 
Q: Yes, I would love to know.
 
A: Well, I had a distant 
relative in Cape Town.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And they  came through New York 
-- not New York, th
rough London --
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: -- to come to AmericA:  Especially came
 through London because
 they wanted to see 
me.
 
Q: Oh, wow.  How did th
ey know you were there?
 
A: Because my mother's sister -- o h , God.
 
Q: Your aunt?
 
A: My aunt lived in Shahigh (ph) -- I don't go 
into all this. That would really -- no, no.  
Forget it.  Just forget it.
 

Q: Okay.  But a relative of yours
 told them you were in London?
 
A: Too much.  Too mu ch.  Anyhow, they  fo
und out thro ugh my  stepfather that I -- you 
know wh at, I should write a book.
 
Q: You should.
 
A: Anyhow, yeah, let's go to another subject. 
 What should we talk 
about, it's already 
time.
 
Q: You were -- they were going from Cape 
Town to London
 on th eir way to America --
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: -- and they knew you were there.
 
A: Yeah.  And we met and they  
said you have no futu re here, 
we going to see that we can 
get an affidavit for you to co
me to AmericA:  Of course they couldn't give me an 
affidavit because they themselv
es needed an affidavit to co
me to AmericA:  But again I 
have a relative in Akron, Ohio -- or had, I do
n't think she's still aliv
e -- Dr. Proscauer (sp) 
and him I didn't even know.  I know his wife --
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: -- when I was a young kid.  
And he put up an affidavit --
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: -- for me.  A man I have never seen.  An
yhow, I waited, I think,
 two years for it to 
materialize to come to AmericA:
 
Q: What happened to  the man you 
were dating for those two years?
 
A: Well, the man I was dating was a Vietname
se man.  He was a young man, he was 
same age I was.  And I though
t when I -- my relatives said 
you coming to America, like I 
said, you have nothing here, there's nothing 
fo r you here and blah
-blah-blah -- so I 
already told you about the affidavit.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: So I thought when I tell 
him that I am going to  Americ
a, he's going to  say, well, 
darling, don't leave, we 
going to get married, but 
instead he said bye bye.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So that didn't  happen.  And I left to go 
to America and I came to
 America on the 1st of 
January, 1956.
 
Q: Okay .
 

A: And the relatives th at I met 
in London came to 
pick me up at the boat and I had -- they 
had a house in Theodore Park or Long 
Island -- I don't know which it is.  Are you 
familiar with New York ?
 
Q: Well, I live in New York but --
 
A: Oh, you live there.
 
Q: Right.  But I live in New 
York City, but I'm not that fa
miliar with the outer areA:
 
A: Okay.  Well, it's, 
it's either Rego Park 
or Long Island, wh atever you want to call.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I lived with them, and my aunt at th
at time was practically 90 years old and the 
daughters were all spinsters,
 in other words, married.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And there was a so n living in the house. And like I said, I had a room there for me 
that they made up. And I -- then after a coupl
e of days I went and registered with the 
unemp lo yment office, or whatever I had to do 
get my , I don't know, social security, if 
that was already, that I don'
t remember either.  
Anyhow, I got a job in  the garment center.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I worked in the garment center, which 
wasn't id eal either, and for a short time.  
And wh ere they let you go because they
 have no work , wh at is that called?
 
Q: When  you're on unemployment?
 
A: Yeah.  I don't ever got unemployment.
 
Q: Severance?
 
A: No.  No.  I just 
work there on -- layoff.
 
Q: Layoff.  Okay.
 
A: Yeah.  And I didn't like the job because I ra
ther do office work instead of being in th e 
garment center, didn't pa
rticularly like that.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: So I went to the unemployment office ag
ain and to ld them I 
was laid off and I'm 
looking for a job.  And I got called, I got
 called for an in terview to -- do you know 
Chamber Street?  Of course you know.
 
Q: Yes.  Yes.  Downtown.
 

A: Yes.  I got called there was a G .L.
 Gailiff (sp), it was a gun wholesaler.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And they  had a storefront too, but they  
were distributors for Berettas, and things like 
that.  And they needed an
 office girl, and I applied for the job and I got it.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And I loved it.  I had the best time in my
 life working for that
 comp any.  And after 
awhile I used to be girl Friday, like filing,
 and wh atever, and at lunchtime I used to 
substitute the girls from the switc
hboard; and then sh e quit after awhile, and I got that job 
and became a switchboard operato r.  And my 
boss loved it -- Jewish people who owned 
the company because people used to say, oh, is she French. 
 I don't know, I don't sound 
anything like French.  But, anyhow, he loved -- 
he liked me to be a switchboard operator.  
So I did that for awhile.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And at lunchtime again I helped  my  -- 
the office manager, who was the accountant 
too, I helped to type bills.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then I got that job to type, to be a b
illing clerk.  And that was so much fun.  I sat 
right next to him and he was the mo st wonde
rful person you would 
want to work for.  
And there I stayed until the day I came to 
Toledo, Ohio. So here
 I am now and got 
married.  I met my husband sh
ortly after I came to Toledo.
 
Q: How did you end up getting to Toledo?
 
A: How did I end up -- my husband -- I became pregnant.  After my  doctor said I will 
never have any kids, b
ecause we were married five years 
and nothing, and the doctor said 
you just won't have any children.  Well, did I 
fool him.  I became pregnant and we didn't 
want to raise a family in Ne
w York .  So my husband lo oked
 fo r employment out of New 
York  and he got a job in  Toledo, and th at's 
how we came to Toledo.  And it was hard.  It 
was really hard.  Ou r beginning here was very, 
very hard because we 
expected Toledo to 
be something what it wasn't.  You know, we are here now 55 years.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: And it changed, Toledo grew quite a bit in 
those 55 years. And it's still a hick town, 
even 55 years later.  S o  it wasn't easy.  Bu
t now, you know, now I'
m at the en d of the 
rope anyway so it doesn 't ma tter anymore.
 
Q: So you had ch ildren together?
 

A: Yes.  I have a daughter that is 55 years 
old, she was born in To
ledo; and I have a son 
who is 52, and he 
was born in Toledo.
 
Q: I gotchA:  Do they still live there now?
 
A: Yes.  My daughter work s for Dillard 's.  
I don't know if you're familiar with Dillard 's.
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: Okay .  Sh e is assistant manager at a brand new store here.
 
Q: That's g reat.
 
A: And my son owns a very nice jewelry store.
 
Q: That's w o nderful.
 
A: Yeah.  So...
 
Q: And did they -- are they married?
 
A: They are both married.  My daughter has two boys.
 
Q: Oh, wonderful.
 
A: One is -- one just got married in July.
 
Q: Congratulations.
 
A: Thank you.  And my son has three little
 g irls, I mean , not little he has twins.
 
Q: Oh, wow.
 
A: Twin  girls, and then he has, th
e oldest is going on 14 next month.
 
Q: Wow.
 
A: And they are really very, ve
ry pretty little girls, they are.
 Both my kids married out of 
faith, my daughter is married to a gentile ma
n and my son is married to a gentile girl.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: But they both turned Jewish
 on the girl, the oldest just had the Bat Mitzpah last year 
and the tw ins are having a Bat Mitzpah or Bar Mitzpah next February.
 
Q: Oh, that's wonderful.
 
A: So th is is my  love story, my  life story.
 
Q: So when you moved to Tole
do you were pregnant already?
 

A: Yes.  We came in January and I deliver
ed my  daughter on March the 4th, highly 
pregnant.
 
Q: And how did you ad just to sort of, 
you know, normal life 
after what you had 
experienced?
 
A: I adjusted actually quite 
well, you know, because a lot of people couldn't adjust.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Do you know that?
 
Q: Yes.  Absolu tely.
 
A: Yeah.  Because a lot of pe
ople couldn't h andle it.  And I -- I am pretty much happy-
go-lu cky and I think th at helped  me.  Maybe
, maybe not deep en ough -- you know, you 
can call it anything you want to.  I'm not a deep thinker.
 
Q: I mean, do you th ink that 
your experiences during the wa
r sort of -- you know, how 
did it affect you raising your family and you
r children and, you know
, just sort of the 
values that you live with now?
 
A: Well, I felt to be -- really started out, 
you know, it was hard.  I didn't bring anything 
into the marriage.  I know my  husband definite
ly didn't  marry me for money because all I 
had was two turtles, so that wasn 't  very mu
ch.  And I gave my  ki
ds anything I could, 
whatever we could give.  Because I always said, you never know what can happen. I 

always have that in front of me to this day, I have that in front of 
me as far as money is 
concerned now.  Y
ou know, do I have enough money?  
Will I be able to make it to the 
day that I no longer will?  That's how I think no
w.  And I believe in giving too.  I like to 
give with  warm hands and not w
ith cold hands, so th
at is mo re or less how I changed. Bu t 
I always was a giver ev
en when  I was a child.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So it might not be just the camp.  I do
n't know if it changed me.  I -- maybe I value 
things mo re than I would have any other time.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Maybe I value friendships too 
more.  I value human life more.
 
Q: You must enjoy spending time with your grandchildren.
 
A: Oh, very much so.  
Unfortunately being that I -- I am 
so tied down with the machines I 
have and can't go out without carrying oxygen 
with me -- and yesterday I was -- I had to 
go to  a rheu matology specialist and I have -- oh my
 God, what is it called, that sickness?  
Fibromy --
 

Q: Fibromyalgia?
 
A: Yeah, that's what I was.
 
Q: So you had some health
 problems over the years?
 
A: Oh, yeah.  I have, I have bad ears; I have
 bad ey es; I have bad 
body; I can't breathe.  
But otherwise I'm doing wo nderful,
 as long as my  mouth can go.
 
Q: And your husband's still alive?
 
A: No.  I lost my  husband 11, it's 
going to  be 11 years in February .
 
Q: Oh, I'm sorry.
 
A: So, and I had to give up my
 house because I couldn't, I c
ouldn't  handle it anymore and 
I was so attached to my 
house and that bothers me.
 
Q: Right, I'm sure.
 
A: Yeah.  I live now in adult living place a
nd of course after home I had a very  nice, 
brand new -- when we moved in 
-- brand new ranch house.  
And I loved my  house.  And 
I had a dog and I had my  kids 
and I had my  husband.  And I 
had to give everything up.  
And the kids are married, you kn
ow, they live their own life.  
I mean, I talk to them daily.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Two and three times a day.
 
Q: And they  live close by?
 
A: Well, in Toledo ev erything is close by.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: The furthest point is 15 minutes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: That's the furthest.
 
Q: Well, that's good then.
 
A: Yeah.  Okay.  You th
ink we more or less, more or less we have it?
 
Q: Yes, I do.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Yes.
 

A: So now you can evaluate what 
you can use and wh at you can't use?
 
Q: Abso lutely.  I'm su re we'l l use everything. 
And if there's anything 
that you decide later 
that you want to still talk to me about or you 
want to ad d, you know, please let me know.  
And if there's anything that
 you have from the war that 
you'd like to share with the 
mu seum, I'm sure that they would love to ma
ke copies of any docum
ents you have or any 
pictures you have.
 
A: I do.  I do but I don't -- my  daughter has 
them because I have one room and a bedroom 
and it's really not the biggest.
 
Q: Right.  Well, if you speak to  her and sh e --
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: -- you know, she has time to 
share some of it, I know that a
ll of that is so helpful, you 
know, for historians.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And the museum is an amaz
ing place that can sort of he
lp you cherish those objects.
 
A: I even have some cards that I 
got when we'r e allowed to get mail.
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: You know, I keep ev erything.  And even  th
en already I kept it, and I brought it back --
 
Q: Right.
 
A: -- you know, that I got.
 
Q: Well, again if there's a
nything, you could al
ways, you know, be in touch with the 
people at the museum.
 
A: Okay .  Okay .
 
Q: Or with me.  And I'm su
re that they would love to make copies of everything.
 
A: Okay .  Okay .
 
Q: Or even if you wanted to
 donate them to the museum, th ey could become part of the 
collection.
 
A: Yeah.  Because my kids, 
you know, they rea
lly, they 're already another generation.
 
Q: Right.  No, I'm sure the museum would love
 that.  I know that 
we took a lot of my 
grandfather's things and --
 
A: Yeah.
 

Q: -- and donated it to the mu seum.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Because it's a great place 
for people to learn from them.
 
A: Okay .  Can I just ask you ab out your
 grandfather, where did they  come from?
 
Q: He was born in Kraków.
 
A: Oh, he was.  So you 
-- no, you were too young.
 
Q: Yeah, he was born in Kraków.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And he was actually on
e of the Schindlerjuden.
 
A: Oh, he was?
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: Oh, that's good.  It's
 good.  So he survived.
 
Q: He surviv ed.  And my  grandmother was 
from Rusnadov, Po
land and she was sent to 
Siberia during th e war.
 
A: Oh, and she didn't  surviv e or did she?
 
Q: She survived.  Sh e and my  grandfather met 
in a displaced person's camp after the war 
in AustriA:
 
A: Oh my  God, that is a story too.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: Oh my God.
 
Q: So we heard a lot of st
ories growing up and unfortuna
tely -- my grandmother's still 
alive but my  grandfather isn't.  But we got hi
m to record his story, you know, a few years 
back before he died.
 
A: Yeah.  Well, I'm g o ing to talk to my da
ughter, if she can get -- I have a document from 
the Kraków ghetto.
 
Q: Yes.  That would be amazing.
 
A: That's made out in my  name but of cour
se I never used it because I never went to 
ghetto.
 
Q: Right.
 

A: But my  father had it and I have it.  Beca
use we had a maid and ev
erything went to our 
maid, she took 
everything out.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: When -- I don 't know, how di
d my -- yeah, Marie.  She us
ed to take -- I have some 
pictures from the family too because of her.
 
Q: Right.  Yes, that would be wonderful.  So

need.  Right?
 
A: Okay .  Thank you so mu ch.
 
Q: Thank you, Mrs. Mann.  It was a pleasure speaking with you.
 
A: Thank you.  I hope you do
n't have a headache too bad.
 
Q: I don't.  It was -- th ank

A: You bet.  Ok
ay.  Thank you --
