We have prepared a br ief s lide pr es entation to

We begin with this portr ait of Rita, s hown here between her
 
Aunt Bella and c ous in, Bayla 
Shulwolf, who peris hed in the Holoc aus t.
 

 
Rita was  bor n Rifka Lifs chitz in 
Dec ember 
1936 in Vasc auti, Rom ania.  The arr ow on the

law in this hous e, 
pic tured on the r ight, whic h als o s erved as  the fam ily hom e.  Their factory had a few loom s to weave 

native Ukr ainian clothing that was  s old in the s
tore.
  
In 1940, the Soviet Army m arc hed into Vas c auti 
and drafted young men, inc luding Rita's  father , into the Arm y.
 
 
When Axis  troops  invaded the Soviet Union the next year, Romanian s oldiers  entered 
Vas c auti and told all the J ews  to pr epar e to leave within 24 hour s .  Rita's family was  able to bribe 

2 
 
Rom anian s oldiers who took  the fam ily to a ghetto in Tr ans nistr ia.  The area known as  Tr ans nistria is  
s hown on this  m ap.  Once ther e, a village fam ily took  Rita's fam ily in.  Rita was  able to attend a s mall 
sch
ool but dur ing the three years  the family lived in the ghetto they fac ed terr ible har ds hips.  After they 
were liberated, the fam ily  was  eventually able to return hom e.
 
 
After the war , Rita attended a Uk rainian s c hool in what had bec om e Communis t Romania.  
By obtaining fals e papers , Rita, her  m other, and her  aunt were able to tr avel fr om Romania to a 
Dis plac ed Pers ons  Camp in Germ any that was  adm inis tered by the U.S. Ar my.  Her e we s ee Rita in 
her  Purim  c os tum e.
 
 
Rita ar rived in the United States  in 1949 with her  m other and her mother's hus band, an 
Aus c hwitz sur vivor
,  
whom  s he m et in the Dis plac ed Persons c amp. They s ettled in New York City.  Rita 
m arried Nathan Rubins tein in 1959 the sam e year Nathan entered the Univer s ity of Maryland for his  
Mas ter 's  degree.  Rita graduated fr om  Brooklyn College in 1960 then joined Nathan in Maryland wher e 
s he began teac hing elem entar y s c hool in Olney, Mar y land, just outs ide of Was hington, DC.  She left 
teac hing to have and rais e their three daughters : Nina, Sher i, and Rene.
 
When the girls wer e older, 
Rita began teac hing at a Yiddis h Hebrew s c hool then later bec ame its pr inc ipal.  After r etir ing fr om  the 

s c hool Rita bec am e a private tutor  for bar and bat m itzvahs , inc luding for adults  who haven't had their 
bar  or  bat mitzvah
. 
 
Nathan pas s ed way at age 58 in 1995.  He had los t m ost of his fam ily during the Holoc aust 
but he s urvived with his  parents in Siber ia.  After  the war they c ame to the U.S.  After s er vic e in the 
U.S. Ar my, Nathan began a c areer as  a s c ientis t at the J ohns  Hopkins  Applied Res ear c h Lab in 
Baltimore with a top s ec ret c lear anc e.

Firs t Pers on
.  
We'll get started bec ause we jus t have you for an hour.
 
 
Although World War II began with Germ any and the Soviet Union invading Poland in 1939, 
m ainly it didn't c om e dir ec tly
 
--
 
the
 
war didn't c ome to your  c omm unity in Rom ania until 1940.  Before 
we tur n to your  life during the war  and the Holoc aus t, tell us, first, a little bit about your  fam ily and y our  

c om m unity and you in thos e year s  before the war  began. 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  I 
was  an only c hild.  I had a loving fam ily.  You would s ay pr etty well to do because 

we had a two
-
fam ily home that we s har ed with my father's  s ister.  You s aw the pic ture.  They had a 
fac tor y with weaving looms .  They would weave c lothing for  the Uk rainian
 
--
 
the natives  ther e.  And my 
m other
 
--
 
they had a dr y goods s tor e.  She s old them.  They had a nanny for  m e.  We had elec tric ity.  It 
was  modern. We had a r adio.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How c omm on was  it to have elec tr ic ity? 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  It was  not that c ommon.  So it was  pr etty good.  And they were able to hire 

s om ebody to do our  laundr y.  Ther e were no was hing m ac hines .

My gr andmother lived with us , m y father's mother who had been widowed in Wor ld War I.  
She s ent her two eldes t daughter s whom  I had never  m et until I came to the United States to the 
golden land.  They wer e only 18 and 16 at the time.  They s aid you c ould find gold in the str eets  in the 
United States  but they wound up working in sweats hops  and s ending m oney, whatever m oney they 
c ould
, home. 
 
 
My father and his  s is ter wer e younger  s o they stayed behind.  And when things got bad, they 
were doing well alr eady and they c ouldn't get out any way.
 
 
My m other
 
--
 
m y gr andparents lived in a nearby town.  My m other was  one of eight c hildren, 
two 
of whom had died befor e the war .  There were no antibiotics available then.  She was  the eldes t.  
And I was  the fir s t gr andchild.  So needles s  to s ay, I was  loved by ever yone.  
 
 
My gr andpar ents had a dr y goods stor e as  well.  They had an orc hard, a farm. 
 
My 
grandm other would 
s ew
 
differ ent c lothing for me.  My younges t aunt was  only s even years  older than I.
 
 
Getting back  to the dr ied goods  stor e, ther e was  a s pec ial
 
--
 
if you haven't been ther e, I 
r ec omm end you go
, t
hey 
were neighbors  and 
f
r iends .  Ther e 
was  one photograph that I s ubm itted to 
the m us eum that I had.  In it, my father is s tanding.  It's on the right
-
hand s ide.  It's not labeled.  That's 
why I'm pointing it out to you.  You s ee the Ukrainians  in their native c ostumes .  Thos e ar e the 

costum es 
that m y father  had manufac tur ed in his  fac tory.  The European that you will s ee, m y father  is  
wear ing a c ap.  An unc le, m y oldes t aunt from the United States, her  hus band c am e to vis it.  This  was  
before the war in the 1930s , ar ound 33, I gues s , befor e my father even was  m ar r ied.  His  s is ter and his

you'll s ee five people in the back ground.  You'll s ee all the rest in the Uk r ainian 
c os tum es .  So you'll be able to s ee that was  m y fam ily, my late father.
 
> > Bill B ens on
:  Inc identally, that ex
hibit "Som e W

N
eighbors " is  very power ful.  It's  just right outs ide 
the doors  of this  theater to your r ight.  If you have tim e after war ds , have the opportunity, we s trongly 
r ec omm end you c ons ider it.
 
 
J us t a little bit more about your father .  You told me he was  a very res pected m an in the 
c om m unity.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yes.  He was  very res pected.  He believed in giving c har ity.  He gave s om e people 

c r edit who c ould 
not affor d things.  He s aid, "It
's fine; you'll owe me m oney."  He was  part of the r itu
al 
c om m ittee.  He helped with bur ials . We c all it
 
--
 
in other words , he was  lik e a c anter.  From the time I 
was  little he used to take m e to s ynagogue but, of c our s e, it was  s hort

lived.  It was  only for four happy 
year s .  I had fr iends .  I had toys .  I had a doll c arriage.  I had m y c ous ins  to play with, a c ous in that was  
eight m onths younger than I and one who was  five year s  older.  So thos e wer e happy tim es .  I 
r em em ber vis iting gr andpar ents.  But unfortunately not for long.

Bill Bens on:  In Septem ber
 
1939, the Soviet Union and Germany attacked Poland whic h r eally 
begins World War II.  It was  s om e months later into 1940 when the war  direc tly affected your fam ily 

when the Soviets  oc c upied your town of Rom ania.  Though you were
 
not yet 4 year s  old, as  you 
m entioned, tell us what you c an about your family's  life and the time when the Soviets  oc c upied. 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  From  what I had been told, the well
-
to
-
do they s ent to Siber ia.  Things  wer e 
differ ent.  They cam e mar c hing 
in.  My oldes t c ous in looked outs ide from the attic
 
--
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Still a kid.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  He was  s till a kid, oh, yeah.  He was  about 8 years  old.  The s oldier s c ame r unning 
up
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They s aw him in the window. 
 

> > Rita Rubins
tein: We were s o frightened we hid under the bed.  So this was  jus t the beginning of a 
fr ightening exper ienc e.
  
We c ouldn't play outs ide anym or e.  Things  were definitely getting differ ent and 
s adder for us .
 
 
When they dr afted the young m en into the Arm y, 
they drafted m y father.  For s ome r eas on 
m y unc le did not get drafted.  He s tayed behind.  That was  the las t time I saw my father, when I was  

4 
1/2 years  old at the time.
 
 
The only thing I have left of m y father bes ides s tor ies  that wer e told to me by his  
fam ily, his  
sister s 
--
 
he was  the only boy and was  dear ly loved by ever yone
 
--
 
was  his  pr ayer 
s
hawl.  It's

c us tom ar y in the J ewis h r eligion for a c ouple who bec omes engaged for the parents  of the br ide to 
pr es ent their futur e s on

in

law with a prayer s hawl
.
  
Amazingly enough, my m other had hoped
 
--
 
dur ing 
the war, s he had his  c lothing with him and s he c ar ried his  pr ayer s hawl.  So this  pr ayer  s hawl is  79 

year s  old, 79 or 80, alm os t 80 year s  old.  He had r ec eived it from my gr andpar ents.  
 
 
My hus band used to lovingly wear  it at high holidays .  It was  beautifully made.
  
I'll s tand up 
and show it to you.  This  is  ac tually s ilver.  I tr ied to pr es er ve it as m uch as I c an.  It's ver y meaningful 

to me.  I wear it on Yom  Kippur and Ros h Has hanah, the high holidays
.  I 
feel that he's s urr ounding m e 
with his  love.  It was  s hort
-
lived but.
  
It's  als o been pr es ent at all of my gr andc hildr en's  bayonet m itzvah 
and hopefully s om e day at their  weddings .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you for br inging that in and s har ing that with us .  It's  jus t beautiful.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  The Mus eum  wanted this  but I s aid I c an't g
ive it up.  It's  m y family heir
loom.  It's  
the only thing.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When your father  was  dr afted and that was , as you s aid, the las t you s aw of him, how 
old was  he at that tim e?
 
> > Rita Rubins tein: Well, he was  s even years  older  than m y m other.  She m arr ied at 23.  I'd s ay he 
was  in his  30s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  He was n't a young man at that point, for dr aft age.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  No.  No.  He was  not dr aft age.  But he was  s till young.  30s , still young to me, an 

old lady
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In ter ms of drafting him, though, he was  in his  ear ly 30s  when they took  him.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know anything about where they s ent him ?
 
>> 
Rita Rubins tein:  All I know is  that he was  fighting agains t the Ger mans , agains t the Nazis
 w
ith his  
bes t fr iends.  That's  how we found out when he met his  dem ise, his  end.
  
I don't know what he was  s ent 
to. We didn't get any m ail.  He was  jus t gone. 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on: When your father left
 
--
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  My mother  was devas tated, his  mother who lived with us .  It was  diffic ult for the 

family. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Who else was  living at home with you?  Your m other, your m other's
 
--
 
his  mother .
 
> > Rita
 
Rubins tein:  Yes.  My father 's  m other  and als o my father's  s is ter and her hus band, her two

> > Bill Bens on:  And this is  your Aunt Bella?
 

> > Rita Rubins tein:  Oh.  Thank you for r eminding m e that.  My mother, her younger  s ister, next in line, 

was  s even years  younger  than m y m other.  She cam e to live with us  whic h was  luc ky for  her , the year 
before we had to leave.  She had a job in an office and lived with us .  And when, of c ours e, the war  
br oke out, s he wanted to go back  ho
m e but the trains
 
--
 
that was  her lucky day
 
--
 
were no longer taking 
her  there s o s he stayed with us  and s he lived with us .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause s he c ouldn't get a tr ain to leave.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Cor rec t.  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As it turned out, as you s aid, that was  lucky for her.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Lucky for her.  Lucky for  us, too, bec aus e s he helped a great deal.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know what happened to the fam ily bus ines s  when your  father was  drafted and 

gone and you'r e under the Soviets  at that point?  What happened to the fam ily bus ines s ?
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  It was  pr etty muc h gone.  We had to c los e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you have any idea how the family was  able to make ends  m eet, to eat and jus t 
bas ic ally m anage?
 
> > Rita Rubins t
ein:  I r eally don't know.  My mother  didn't want to talk about thes e things  too muc h.  My 
r ec ollec tion is  going back  quite a few years .
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Right.  Right.
 
 
So you're living under the Soviets , of c our s e, until J une
 
1941 when Germany and its  al
lies  
turned on the Soviets  and Rom anian troops
 
--
 
Romania was  an ally of the Germans
 
--
 
oc c upied the 

5 
 
town and the effects  of that on you and your fam ily were imm ediate.  Tell us  what happened onc e the 
Rom anians  wer e now in c ontr ol. 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  As
 
you know, the Rom anians were allies  of the Germ ans .  So they c am e marc hing 
in, the s ame mar c h that you s ee the Germ an s oldiers , how they c ame in.  To let us  k now that they 
m eant bus ines s  they took  20 young men, J ewis h.  Their only crim e was  being Jewis h. 
 
They marc hed 
them into the m arket.  They as ked people to c ome.  And they s hot them , 20 of them.  And one of them  
was  an engineer that my Aunt Bella knew from her  offic e.  So we s aw the beginning of the atr oc ities .  It 
was  a very frightening time.  I no longer went out to play.  Ther e was  a lot of s adnes s.  We were 
r es tr ic ted as  to when we were allowed to go out.
 
 
Shor tly, s hortly after, we wer e given 24 hours.  They didn't tell us where we wer e going but 
they s aid you c an take whatever  belongings you can carr y, tak e with you.  That's how m y mother took  

the prayer s hawl.  She dres s ed m e in four layers  of c lothing.  That I remem ber.  4
 
1/2 years old, I had a 
bac kpack with whatever other c lothing s he c ould pac k .  Took  s ome bedding.  It's am azing how muc h 

they 
took  and c ar r ied with them , a lot of pack s .
 
 
The reas on I have photographs  of c ours e were bec aus e of my two aunts  in this  New York  
wher e we s ent them .  But in addition to that, s he put an album  in the attic .  They s om ehow tr ied to hide 
it, an album of s om e
 
pic tur es  and s ome m oney.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To keep hidden in the fam ily home.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Right, keep it hidden in the family hom e bec aus e we were hoping to return.  And 

m y gr andmother, may s he r est in peac e, s he had m oney s ewn in her under garments.  I asked her
,  
"W
hy are you doing this ?"  She s aid, "You never  k now.  This might help us  out one day."
 
 
So we had to be ready, 24 hour s, leave our home behind. We gather ed at the train station.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you said, literally with whatever  you could c ar ry as well as  wear ing.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  They wouldn't tell us where we wer e going. We were s uppos ed to be going to be a 

death c amp. 
 
 
Thanks to m y grandmother's fores ight, one night we were
 
--
 
I c an't tell you
 
--
 
it was  a gr eat 
auditorium.  I 
had an ear infection.  That I r em em ber .  Hundreds  of people, almos t 1,000 people.  My 
unc le s omehow found out that we c ould get out of the trans port.  After  we had already gotten
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So they had put you on tr ains  after  you had 24 hours  andthey took  you ther e.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Right.  And fr om ther e we wer e going to be sent to the death c am p. 
 
 
So s om e Rom anian s oldier s  took bribes .  And on barges
 
--
 
ther e was  a river .  They took  us to 
Transnis tria.  They took  s om e people.  Of c ours e it 
was  taking
 
a c hanc e.  Your life was  in 
danger.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your fam ily wouldn't have known, even if they offer ed them the br ibes , that, in fac t, 
they would have done that but in this  c as e they did.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know how it
 
was  done.  It was  done s ec retly.
 
 
They did tak e us.  But many of the s oldier s
 
--
 
it was  on barges .  We were on barges.  We 
were not on c r uis es or any s hip.  A s oldier
 
--
 
I had blond hair at the tim e.  A s oldier was  holding m y 
hand.  I gues s he looked at m
y mother's anguis hed fac e 
--
 
bec aus e m any of the s oldier s thr ew the 
c hildren into the river  and they never  m ade it anywher e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om the barge.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  From  the barge.  Yes.  They killed them then.  So he s aid, "
D
on't worry.  I h
ave a 
little girl the s am e age.  I'm not going to harm your daughter ."  So that was  one tim e I was  s aved.
 
 
There were righteous  gentiles .  They wer e far between but there were people that tr ied to 
help.  And that's ver y, very impor tant to r emember .  One per s on c an s ave a life.  You s ave the wor ld.

Correct.  Correct.

> > Bill Bens on:  So you get acros s the r iver and you m ade it to the village of Shargorot.  You have 
m em or ies  that are both good and bad.  Tell us  about thos e years, thr ee years , as  bes t you c an knowing 
how young you wer e living in this village of Shargorot for  that time.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein: Well, it was  a ghetto.  My aunt was  taken.  Two soldiers  c am e and they took  her to 

the labor c am p from there, Bella.  The c onditions  we lived under wer e terrible but at least we had a r oof 
over  our head.  I s aw people dying in the street.  They had no s helter whats oever .
 
 
We wer e very luc ky, as  you pointed out.  A family, they had two c hildr en s o they wer e four.  
Nine of us c am e.  They had the one bedroom.  It was  a one
-
bedr oom  c lay hut.  No running wa
ter , no 
elec tr ic ity, a potbelly s tove that kept ever ybody war m.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So a fam ily of four lived in this  hous e.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  That was  their hom e.  They were very kind.  They were ver y poor but they took  us  

in
, a
ll nine of us.  Ther e wer e no bathr ooms.  And exc us e me, ther e was  a pail.  I r emember .  It was  
bitter c old.  The weather  was  very c old.  And, of cour s e, we had to em pty that pail.  So if you had to 

have movement, you had to go outs ide.  
 
 
So the c ondition
s wer e really pretty bad and we had no food.
  
If you wanted to get s om e 
food, we wer e luc ky, m y Aunt Bella was  ver y good with her hands and s he would take our old s weater s 
and knit s ome new things  and go on the black  market.  So s he was  able to trade for a
 
piec e of br ead 
now and then.  And we had potato and water, like a soup, at night. 
 
Conditions  wer e bad.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You s aid to me, m entioned you didn't have m uch food
.  Y
ou had s aid that you 
r em em ber being always  hungr y.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  A lways  
hungr y.  In fac t, you said a s c hool.  It was  just a nurs ery s c hool, a 

kindergarten.  One woman fr om our area had es tablis hed it.  So to keep us  c hildren a little bit bus y and 
happy.  The happiest time was  when I was  able to s hare with them that, oh, I had a piec e of bread 

today with oil.
 
 
As  c hildr en, you find things to play with.  We had little r ocks . We had little dolls  made out of 
r ags  that m other and aunt m ade for us.  
 
 
Talking about the little doll in rags , I rec all. What kept m e alive really was  not having been 
s epar ated fr om m y m other  and her loving c are. 
 
Our c leanlines s , s he had to go about half a mile or  
m or e to take our laundr y to the river.  None of us s wam.  I went along with my c ous in to was h c lothes  

for our dolls . 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was hing your  c lothing in the river. 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yes.  And s uddenly my c ous in s aid, "Oh, A
unt Tina, look , there's  a little girl in the 
water ."  That was  I.  I was  dr owning.  But my m other  thought very quickly and thr ew a s heet in and 
pulled me out.  It wa
s such a
 
tr aumatic exper ienc e for m e.  I did not s leep for about thr ee days .  There 
were no doc tor s  or anybody.  There was
 
--
 
I c all it a witc h.  She helped me.  She took and br ok e an egg 
on m y forehead.  They believed in all of thes e witc hc r aft things .  Sort of mumbled s ome abrac adab
r a 
things whic h you know from  "Cinder ella."  Mir ac le of m ir ac les , I s tarted s peak ing again. 
 
It was  ver y, 
very hard, a har d time.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you said, I think  now we have 13 people c rowded into the little one

> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At some point while you wer e there, your  aunt, unc le, and their  family whic h was  part 
of the 13 dec ided to leave.  What c an you tell us about that? 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  They had to leave.  It was  impos s ible.  My c ous in was getting older.  He was  a boy.  

He was  hungry all the time.  But he was  s o hones t.  My aunt would get very ups et with him.  She would

Bec aus e he was  hungr y.  He begged for more.  She s aid we c ould have m or e food on 
the table.
 
 
So they left.  They were in a labor c am p.  They jus t left for another labor  camp.
  
They c ame 
bac k  after a little while and my unc le s uffered fr om  Typhoid.  People wer e s ick all the tim e.  It's a

No.  No

No m edic al c ar e at all.

Ac c ording to our r eligion, als o, we have to be buried in s hrouds , white s hr ouds .  I asked ques tions
, a

longer there, m y father 's s is ter who left for the other labor c am p, I was  the oldes t gr andc hildr en there, if 

I would light the c andle for  her  when s he's gone.

ﬂ  
And s he s aid, "T

H

Of c ours e, nobody else was  bur ied s o s he was  privileged.  I only have one gr aves ite.  I have 
not been back .  I had no des ir e to go back.  But she's  bur ied s omewhere in the Ukr aine.  And s he does

Dur ing that tim e, as hard as it was , you were able to get s om e educ ation.  Tell us how you 
were able to go to s c hool.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Ar e you talking about dur ing the war?
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Yeah.  Dur ing thos e years .  I think  you went to a small, little c las s that was  organized 
by s om ebody
 
--
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Somebody from our town organized it.  She taught Hebr ew.  We had s inging.  I 

don't know how it was  done but s om ehow they managed to do it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the c omm itm ent was  ther e to try to find a way to give you s om e form of education 

dur ing that tim e.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yes. We lear ned s om e wor ds  and som e s ongs to try to keep us bus y and 

oc c upied.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you said, you wer e under  these c irc um s tanc es  for about thr ee year s .  Then the 

Soviets , as  they'r e moving wes twar d, they c am e into Shargor ot and oc c upied it es s entially as  liber ators 

this  time.  Tell us what you c an about what it was  like when the Rus s ians  c am e back in to now tak e

you.  And now, of c our s e, you'r e under the Soviet's  c ontrol.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein: Well, you'r e talking about c om ing back  home.

>> Ri

yes .  Before they c am e in.  Befor e we knew that we were 
liberated.  We hear d the bom bing.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  You hear d the bom bing.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  It was  jus t terr ible.  So we were told leave your  house.  Ther e was  a neighbor who 

had a bas ement.  Many people c r owded in that bas em ent.  We waited and waited.  The front was  

c om ing nearer and nearer .
 
 
One 12
-
year

old boy c ould not c ontain hims elf and he s aid he had to go out and s ee what's 
happening.  He r an out.  Of c ours e
 
his  parents  wer e ver y frightened for his  life.
  
When he c am e back , 
he s aid, "T
he Russ ians
 
are her e. We are liberated.  Ther e's  no war."  And they thought he's 
ha
lluc inating; it r eally c an't be.  But s ur e enough, we s tar ted c oming out s lowly and there wer
e the 
Rus s ians .  
 

 
We wanted to go back home, of c ours e, to Vas c auti.  How c onditions  were, they didn't 
c hange m uc h but, of c our s e, we had more fr eedom  to m ove ar ound and they were our  heroes bec aus e 
they liber ated us.  And at las t we were fr ee. We did no
t feel obligated to anybody.  
 
 
But we s till had to stay in this  c lay hous e for a little while.  And then we wer e trans por ted on 
the Arm y trans port train.
  
My aunt who had r ec ognized som ebody from  hom e, a young m an whos e 
grandfather was  a pr iest, he helped
 
check things  out, how we c ould get bac k  hom e.  They didn't 
pr ovide us  with trans portation or wor ry about us  getting back .

> > Bill Bens on:  It was  lik e you're fr ee to go but you'r e completely on your own.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  On your  own.  Right.  Right. 
 
You have to s ur vive on your  own. 
 
 
So they c hecked it out.  This  s oldier , he was  a Rom anian
 
--
 
ac tually, not Rom anian.  He was  
a Ukr ainian s oldier.  He got us on s ome tr ain and we got to Vas c auti.  But he als o helped us find a 
plac e to live. We c ould not
 
get into our own hom e becaus e the Rus s ians , an Iron Curtain started 
s etting in 
and the Russ ians  had taken over  our hom e.  They us ed it to s tore gr ains .  So we c ould not 
get in there.
 
> > Bill Bens on: W
hen I firs t met you, you s aid "T
hey took  our home and m ade it into a s ilo."
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  That's  what they did.  It was  a beautiful hom e.  They made it into a s ilo.
 
 
But I had great gr andparents  who had a hous e there and other people lived there but the 
s oldier s  helped us get a room in that hous e s o that we were able to live ther e.
 
 
My aunt, again, got a pos ition in a bank .  It was  m y fir st experienc e ther e was  in a s c hool.  I 
went to a Rus s ian s c hool where they indoc tr inated the s tudents to love Stalin.  And Stalin's  pictur e, we 
were to kis s Stalin's  picture.  He's  the liberator.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You remem ber that, don't you?
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  I r em em ber  that well.  We walked about a mile to s c hool.  It was  my first grade 
experienc e.  So I lear ned Uk r ainian.  I lear ned how to read.  I was  a very good
 
s tudent.
 
 
My m other s aid s he had to beg the people who were watc hing over
 
our hous e, us ing it as a 
s ilo:  P
leas e let m e in
. M
y hus band was  a soldier in your  Ar my
; a
ll I want is to get my pic tures.  She did 
m anage to get the album.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She 
did?
 

> > Rita Rubins tein:  They finally let us  in.  Yes .  She had s om e pic tur es.  But the money was  gone
 
wh
ic h is  ok.  And that's how
 
--
 
oh, and at that time we als o found out how m y wonder ful gr andparents , 
aunts and unc les wer e mur der ed.  My mother  found som e people fr om the town.  She asked what 

happened to my parents.  They gave her a blow
-
by
-
blow des c ription of how her ver y 
pious
 
--
 
m y 
grandfather was  pious , too, very giving.  He gave c r edit to all of his  neighbors  who wer e Uk r ainian 

farm er s.  They used 
farm  implem ents to m ur der  m y grandmother , m y aunts  and unc le.  They left my 
grandfather to the end.  They had him watc h and then they murder ed him, too.  They even had the 

dates down s o that my mother was  able to obs er ve thos e dates . We put up a c andle in
 
their mem or y. 
 
But ther e was  a horrible s hock to find out when y ou have los t your par ents , your s is ters , your  br other .
 
 
My father's  fr iend, who was  drafted at the s ame tim e that he was , he c ame back.  He was  
luc ky enough to c ome bac k .  He s ur vived.  He told us  exac tly when m y father  was  killed.
  
At leas t I 
have the knowledge that my father  was  killed fighting the Germ ans.  He was  not br utally murder ed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So your m other and fam ily learned all of this  at the s am e time.
 
>>
 
Rita Rubins tein:  All of this  while we wer e there.  We were there for a year . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that time, Rita, when your  mother, of c our s e, realiz es  that she's los t not only her  
hus band but her par ents and m any of the family, what did your  mother
 
do to help m ake ends  m eet, to 
m ake s ur e that you c ould s ur vive, have food on the table?  What did your  m other and the r emaining 
m em bers  of your fam ily do? 
 
> > Rita Rubins tein: Well, m y aunt worked
;  
s o s he was  on a s alar y.  My mother and other aunts, they
 
r eally went illegally, in the black m arket, s old things and br ought food.  It was  har d.  But at leas t we had 
the fr eedom .  Not the freedom  that you have here.  This  was  under the Rus s ian rule.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se, the war is  still going on.
 
> > Rita
 
Rubins tein:  Yes, the war  was  s till going on.  Corr ec t.  Corr ec t.  They were definitely hard times .
 
You s aw Rus s ian s oldiers  ther e.  They were very kind to m e.  I r emem ber that.  They loved the fact that 
I lear ned s om e Rus s ian.  When I br ought a repor t c ard, they wer e nic e about it, things .  But not s o 
nic e
 
--
 
ther e wer e a lot of people that wer e killed.  And there were very few J ews  that c ame back
 t
o our  
town. 
 
Chevr a kadis ha, it was  a larger town.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But a few c ame back .
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:
  
Yes.  A few c ame back .

> > Bill Bens on:  In tim e, your  mother , your  aunt and you wer e able to es c ape fr om Comm unis t 
Rom ania and m ade your way to a Dis plac ed Persons  Camp after the war had ended.  Tell us what you 
c an about your es c ape to ac tually get away
 
and m ake it to a Dis placed Pers ons  Camp.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Ok .  That was  a s tory in its elf.  That I r em ember m or e c learly bec aus e I was  older  

at the tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of c our se.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein: We had paper s that wer e fals ified.  We wer e, of c ours e, bor n in Rom ania s aying 

that we were from Poland.  So we had fals e paper s . We wer e getting r eady to leave.  Our papers  wer e 
all in or der.  But m y aunt wor ked for the Rus s ian bank .  We wer e on the train and my aunt s till was n't 
ther e.  At the las t minute, bec aus e they wouldn't let her  go, s he did ar rive.
 
 
Inter es ting, another s tor y about a r ighteous gentile.  Ther e was  a young man who was  
c hecking the papers  a young s oldier .  His  m other happened to be a m idwife to m y grandmother and 

deliver ed s om e of
 
m y aunts .  So he knew ver y well
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: Who you wer e.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein: Who we were.  And he c ould have r epor ted us but he did not.  So it was  thanks to 
him  that we got on the train.
 
 
For  the mos t part, the tr ains  were c oal trains , c attle t
r ains .  We just hopped on them illegally.  
We didn't have any tickets  or anything.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  All you had was  fals ified paper s.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Falsified papers.  We had to pas s  through bor der s .  We pos ed as  Greeks, as 

differ ent nationalities .  
They gave us  a ver y har d tim e. We begged for water .
 
 
Finally, finally, we tr aveled at night, it took  us

with the undergr ound

three months .  We 
went through Poland.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The thr ee of you.

Bens on:  You, your  aunt, and your  m om.

My mom 
and als o my aunt, my mother's  s ister, was  with us  at the tim e.
 
 
We finally got to Ger many.  It was  Munic h.  The United States
, 
with the help of the Hebr ew 
Sheltering Soc iety, they s et up this Dis plac ed Pers ons Cam p.  So where did they s et them  up?  They 

s et them up in for mer  c amps  or the c am ps where the Nazis  were trained.  We wer e in a c am p where 
the Nazi s oldiers  wer e trained.  They wer e like barr acks. We had a room that we s har ed.

it was  the firs t time

I m et a young little girl m y age in school who did

P olis h fam ily.  
 
 
So ther e wer e s ome r ighteous  people ar ound.  And we do thank  them.  Ther e is  a s pec ial

There was  a quota sys tem then. We had a wonderful sc hool.  It

her e wer e only about 100

Bec aus e of s tar vation and poor diets, I

I was  with

Thank  God, we had fam ily in the United States .  And Bella, by the way, at that time was  away

Cam p when Israel won its  independenc e.  You rem em ber that night

> > Rita Rubins tein:  Yes.  Als o, let m e just go back  a little bit.  At one of our  perfor m anc es , my mother  
was  in the audienc e.  I loved the stage.  I have loved to s ing even then.  I inher ited it from  my fathe

m ay he r es t in peac e.  She s at next to a lady and the lady s aid, "I wonder if the m other of this  c hild 
su
r vived."  And my mother  s aid, "I'm the m other."  And s he started to c r y.  And s he s aid, "I los t a child 
and s he would have been the s am e age."  So t her e were m any of thos e ins tanc es that I will never 

forget.
 
 
And you wer e s aying

> > Bill Bens on:  The independenc e of Is r ael.  You r em em ber  that.
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Oh, yeah.  At the s c hool, I was  out of the s anitar ium at that point. When Isr ael was  

dec lar ed independent in 1948, May
 
15, we c hildren s tayed up all night long bec aus e we wer e s urviv ing 
c hildren.  We built a big bonfir e. We were jus t so elated and s o happy. We no longer
 
had to

ther e's a s ong "Tell me where s hal
l 
I go, t
her e's no plac e for  m e, to the left to the right."  There 
was  no place.  No one took  us  in.  You know about the 
S
aint L
o
uis .  Unfortunately they went to their  
death.  Nobody wanted the J ews .  Ther e were two c ountr
ies
 
that did help out.  In any c as e, that's

we 
s tayed up all night.  We danc ed and s ang.  And, of cours e, we finally had a c ountry of our own.  That's 
why Is rael has to s tay
 
--
 
they'r e a good ally of the United States .  That's why I will always  fight for  it to 
be independent, to have our own c ountr y.  If we had an Is r ael then, then all of thes e people would have 

s ur vived. 
 
We'r e talking about 1.5
 
m illion.  It's  unfathomable.  Six million J ews  and non

J ews , too

the 
gyps ies , Chr is tian, Catholic s , non

J ews  too s uffered.  A lot of people s uffered in the war . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Eventually it took  another year , I think , 1949, when your mother was  able to get you 

bec aus e you had s ome relatives  had c ome to the United States  earlier that were here whic h enabled 
you c ome to the United States.  You told m e
 
that when you got her e, your mother was  very protec tive 
of you.  Can you s ay a little bit about that?
 
>>
 
Rita Rubins tein:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I was  her only c hild.  The reas on I was  her only c hild was  the year 
I was  born, they alr eady hear d Hitler's  speec hes  and they knew what was c oming.  She was  very 
pr otective of m e, yes .  She didn't allow m e to ic e s kate. 
 
She was  wor ried that s om ething would happen 
to me, s wim m ing.  Well, I didn't have any opportunities .  I didn't know how to s wim.  Thanks to Brooklyn 

College, wher e I attended, we had to pas s a s wimm er 's tes t in order for us  to rec eive a diploma.  So 
that 
was  when I lear ned how to s wim. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She had to allow you 
to 
learn how to s wim .
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  That's  right.  That's  r ight.  Her only c hild.  She was  very pr otec tive.  I was  very 

c los e to her.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How did your m other do onc e
 
s he c ame her e?
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Ok .  Well, we c ame her e.  She had been m ar ried to my s tepfather.  We c ame her e 
with nothing.  And this is  really the land of opportunity.  We c an c ritic ize as  muc h as  we want but we 

have the fr eedom to critic ize.  It's 
fr eedom of s peec h.  We have the freedom  to fr ee educ ation, really.  
 
We had nothing.  We qualified for welfar e but we would not take it.  My s tepfather took up hous e 

painting. We lived in a small apar tm ent.  But we wer e so happy to be here.  
 
 
The journey, I will never forget that. We went on an Army tr ans por t, Gener al Haan. We had 
bunk  beds  r ight next to the engine.  My m other  and I never  left the c abin bec aus e we wer e s o ill.  

However  when we landed in New Yor k  City 
H
ar bor , to s ee that Statue of Liberty, I have to tell you, it 
was  one of the happiest tim es  in m y life.  The s tatue of freedom
. W
e were finally free to practic e our  
r eligion, free fr om all the problems .  But, of c our s e, we wer e als o free, unfor tunately, of m any of our 
family m em ber s.  So the
re were a lot of m ixed feelings .
 
 
We had to move in with my Aunt Bella who at that point had a c hild, a little baby.  The thr ee 
of us m oved in with her in what I thought was  a very ric h neighbor hood.  Apar tm ents were ver y har d to 
get.  I was  put into a s eventh gr ade, a s pec ial c las s  yet.  Som e of my fr iends  had a piano and I r eally 

thought they were r ic h.
  
We stayed there with her s ever al months  until we were able to get our  own 
apar tm ent.  It was  not as affluent as  a neighborhood.  I found s om e c hildr en who s poke s om e Yiddish.
 
 
Another  thing, we had no bilingual educ ation then.  It was  s ink  or s wim.  I was  s o frus tr ated.  I 
didn't open up m y m outh for thr ee m onths.  And when I got to high s c hool, the pr inc ipal had c alled me 

in.  I s ays , what did I do?  I wa
s  a good s tudent.  He s aid, "
I
'm am azed at the I.Q. tests .  Your  average 
has  gone up s o m uc h, your  s c ore."  I s aid
, w
ell, I was  her e for  three months .  Not only did you put m e in 

12
 
 
the s eventh gr ade where I had to lear n Frenc h as well, I didn't k now Englis h,
 
you gave m e
 
--
 
it's a 
wonder  that I pas s ed this I.Q. test.  I didn't k now the differ enc e from a Shoem aker and a tailor.  Of 
c our se I've improved.  I've had the educ ation. 
 
 
I always tell
 
--
 
m y kids  know that story.  It was  hard but it was  bitters weet bec aus e I was  able 
to get the educ ation.  And the s am e with c ollege.  If you pers ever e and if you try hard, you c an do it.  
You r eally c an do it.  It's  the land of opportunity.
  
I went to s c hool at night.  I went to c ollege at night, 
took the bus  and train.  But if you r eally want s omething, you c an do it. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And it's c lear from what you just s aid that you ver y m uc h have your m other's strength 

and s pirit and m any gifts from  your father  as  well.
 
 
I'm going to tur n back  to Rita in a m oment to c lose
 
the program but I think we have tim e for a 
c ouple of ques tions from the audienc e. We have m ic r ophones on both s ides  of the ais le.  If you have a 

question, pleas e wait until you have the m ic rophone.  Pleas e mak e the ques tion as brief as you c an.  I 
will r
epeat it just to be s ure that everybody hears  it and then Rita will r es pond to it.
 
 
Do we have a c ouple of questions ?  Anybody wants  to ask  befor e we c los e our pr ogr am ? 
 
 
Ok. Well, I'm  going to give you another  oppor tunity and that's  when Rita's done up h
er e.  S o 
when Rita finis hes the progr am
 
--
 
I'm going to turn 
to 
Rita in a mom ent.  She's going to c los e our 
pr ogram .  But Rita, you'll s tay behind with us  on the s tage.  So if anybody would like to c om e up, say hi, 
s hake her hand, get a photograph taken with her or ask  her a ques tion, you'r e a little s hy to ask, you'll 

have an opportunity to do that.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our
 
First P er son
 
gets the las t word.  So I thank  all of you 
for being her e.  We hope you c an c ome back.  Our  progr ams  are ever y Wednes day and Thur s day 
through the middle of August.
 
 
When Rita's  done, s he'll not only s tay on
 
the s tage but our photogr apher Joel who took  the 
glorious  photogr aphs  you s aw in the beginning of the pr ogr am will c om e on the s tage and take a 

photog
r aph of Rita with you in the back gr ound.  It's  a lovely photograph.  At that point we'll ask you 
to 
s tand to take the photograph.
 

 
Rita?
 
> > Rita Rubins tein:  Thank  you for being suc h a good audienc e.  I mus t compliment the young people.  
You wer e wonder ful, r eally good m anners. 
 
 
Thank  God that we s urvived one of our  darkest days  in his tory.  I'm really grateful to the 
United States  for opening its  door s 
to 
us .  I'm very patriotic.  It is  the greates t c ountr y in the wor ld.  We 
s hould appr ec iate the fr eedom s
 
that we have and all of the opportunities .  I'm proud to be a U.S. 
c itizen.  
T
hanks to our many wom en in the m ilitary for  the sac rific es that they have m ade and ar e still 
m aking in pr otecting our  fr eedom.  
 
 
We mus t rem em ber the pas t.  Find c ourage in the
 
futur e.  Never  s tand s ilent.  Always  s peak 
up when you witnes s  bullying, prejudic e.  Hate is never  right.  Love is never  wr ong.  Help thos e in need.  
Always  take a stand. When you s ave one per s on's  life, it's  as  though you have s aved the wor ld.
 
 
I'm dedic ating today to my gr andpar ents who wer e br utally mur der ed by their  neighbor s.  In
 
their memor y, the mem ory of m y father, the s ix million

1.5
 
m illion 
c hildren
, I
 
will c ontinue to tell my 
s tory.  Now all of you will be able to pas s  it on to your  c hildr en
 
and tell them  that you ac tually met a 
s ur vivor  and the Holoc aus t did happen.  There are a lot of deniers that say the Holoc aus t did not 
happen.  Believe m e, it happened. 
 
 
I hope and pray that none of you will exper ienc e war, hunger, and los s  of fam ilies .  May we 
enjoy s halom, whic h means  peac e, and the wor ld.  May God bles s you all.  And may God bles s the 
United States  of Americ a. 
 
 
Thank  you for lis tening.
