Interv iew with 
Harold Zi ssman 
February 28, 2000 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: So, we™ll just have a little conversati
on so that I can test th e level, and you can 
tell me about your neighborho
od a little bit, and ho
w long you™ve lived here, and I™ll just 
test your -- 
Answer: Okay, I moved in here 
originally, in January, about 
two or three, of 1981. And 
I™ve been living here in the 
same apartment, since. I bought
 a apartment here before it 
was built, I bought it off a plan, and that™s 
where we spent all these y ears now since, 
which it me ans over 20 years henc
e. Is comin g  
through good? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay . 
Q: I™m just going to listen to it. Okay, Un
ited States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff 
and Toby Herr collection. This
 is an interview with Mr. 
Harold Zissman, conducted by 
Arwin Donohue, on February 28
th
, 2000. And this is a follow
 up interview, it™s a post -- 
focusing on post-Holocaust era -- it™s a follo
w up interview to an interview that we 
conducted with Ha
rold Zissman, in 1995. That was a 
Holocaust era interview, conducted 
on videotape. And we™re going to
 start by reviewing so me -- some things that -- that took 
place immediately following the war, and then 
move on to what ha
ppened in the United 
States, which will be our focus today. So, one 
of the first things that I wanted to know 
was when you -- in the last in
terview, that Randy Goldman co
nducted with you, it wasn™t 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062

very clear to me what liberation meant, a
nd wh ether there was a mo ment when you were 
actually liberated, when you were recognizing, okay, I™m
 not responsible for being 
platoon commander any more, and I™m -- I™m a -- 
now I have to decide what co mes next. 
Can you describe that a little more? 
A: Of course. That was a very hard thing at 
the time, turning the cl
ock back to the era. 
The forest sort of served as 
-- as a safety, away from the peop
le who wanted my life, sort 
of -- without a gu -- good reason. Therefore, 
my separation from the forest was a very 
hard one to do. The commanding 
officer that particular time, when asked by two of my  
for -- comrades who were in my  platoon, ask 
me why am I not going out to jo in them, 
and see where I can enlist myself
 to do a jo -- to work, well 
he told them, ﬁWhere do you 
think Harold  is going to  go? Is he going to  en
list himself to be in 
the police? No, I don™t 
think I want him to be there, I want him to
 be in a more importa
nt job.ﬂ Wh ereu pon, not 
so long after that, I™m getting 
an  assignment to go to -- and take some people that they 
immediately drafted, between the ages of 18
 through 45, to join th e Red Army ™s armed 
forces. And be for the fact th
at the railroad tracks between Gr
odno and Marstee, were not 
ready, because we, the partisans,
 the yesterday™s destroyers of
 that, to s -- to not let the 
Germans be able to carry on their war, now 
had a problem of going back to see that 
they™ve all repaired, so the Red 
Army  could be able to bring 
in their supplies, as well as 
manpower. So, they  were drafted and I could -- 
well, was ordered to  organize a -- another 
squad because I could -- I did not have enou
gh to make a platoon, because everybody 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062

was trying to  get organized, and they [indeciph
erable] me to do it. So  I mu st have gone 
about maybe 10 or 12 guys, and with that I 
started, and I reported to duty. And with 
bayonets open, we were marching them like they
 were prisoners, much
 rather than they 
were the people who are willing to serve, and 
go to fight the war, to liberate the rest of 
them, be the end of Germany. It made a bad 
impression on me, but an order is an order, I 
had to do it. So, freedom at th
at particular time to me, I 
d id not even get taste of the 
freedom yet. I can only explain my self that 
those same people that I have to guard -- I 
had to guard at the time to 
take them, still had in them that anti-Semitism, although I 
didn™t do anything against those people. 
They couldn™t accuse me personally, but a 
pluralistic way of hate, because I was a Jew,
 didna -- still was im
bedded in them, and I 
felt the non-safety there. It took us al -- it t
ook us almost until we put them on the train, 
and we go -- and we were able to move, was 
almost a w eek before the train could start 
operating. And as soon we reached the old border between the U.S. -- between the Soviet 
Union, and Poland, the KGB -- the army 
KGB took over command, and I was getting 
papers to be released with my squad that I ha
d over there, and to go back to our -- well, I 

was told while living, where 
the officers are going to be, th
e local officers. However, I 
was told by my  comma nding officers, if I shoul
d return , and they  will not be there any 
more. The staff -- the general staff will be in
 Minsk, which was the capital of Belarus, 
and I am to report to any of 
those places, after my assignmen
t will be done. Whereupon --

Q: So we got some of that -- that -- we got
 the information ab out how you went to Minsk 
-- 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: -- in the first interview. I just wanted to
 clarify a little bit that
 -- how you knew, okay, 
I™m not beholden  to the partisan group any 
more. Now I have to just make my decision 
about wh at comes next, and -- and I was trying 
to get a sense of what you were thinking 
you -- you would do next, before you got in -- in
volved with
 the KGB. 
A: Well, that™s what it was at that particular
 time, our returning back  to Minsk was used, 
since I had papers to be housed, and to  be 
fed. So  it was sort of used like vacationing. 
After all, now we are free birds on ourselv
es. From my  whole squad, I only remained 
three of -- two of the former guys, which 
they were Belarus, and I was their command 

por -- befo re I was their platoon commander, and 
now they were with me. They were sort 

of mo re like friends that we knew during the 
war, and during the par
tisans, when I would 
come in their settlemen t, they parents knew me
, and as a matter of fact, I felt relief to be 
in their company, because relie
ve means secure. I was secure
 that no foul things could 
happen towards me in that particular time. 
So, we all went to that particular time, I 
received my medals, well I -- well I already said
, being on th e train, and all of a sudden, I 

found myself that I™m going to 
work for the KGB, which this 
was the farthest thing of my  
mind that I ever expected to happen. Bu t 
I am the -- took soldiering before, wh en I 
escaped the ghetto, and I figured I™m continui
ng th e same way. Besides that, I know the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
6
 
 
 
 
consequences, what it wo
uld have been had I refused, an
d I would not want to become a 
KGB working person. Howe
ver, when I came to Boronivitch,
 which that was sort of the 
re-region to where I was going to
 work, in that office there, 
and I passed all th e tests they 
wanted me to know, I told them that I want
ed to go now for a little
 bit vacation with the 
two guys that they enlisted th
emselves in the militia, and not
 in the KGB, because their 
education was below mine, and 
therefore they wouldn™t pass to
 go into the KGB. And I 
wanted to go back to their 
settlement. Besides, I wanted, 
by any chance of all, maybe 
there was someone of my  family, who by 
-- by any kind of way, surv ived , and if 
anything, probably that woul
d be the place to meet them
. On the other hand, I was 
separated from the partisans, the Jewish par
tisans, who were natives of Darechen -- of 
that -- of that city where the ghetto was that 
I escaped to the forest. 
I had my  desire to go 
ahead to meet them, b ecause we were separa
ted, since I joined th
e other part, which it 
was in arvens, which I mean the paratroope
rs, with the General kus -- with General 
Kustenko. So I was separated from all my past
, sort of, in -- in 
spirit, as well as 
physically, and I was anxious to go there. So
 when I put it out that
 I want to go for two 
weeks, I was granted, and meaning gran ted at
 that particular time, you had to  have a 
permit, otherwise, without a permit, you could 
have been arrested easily, and who knows 
where to -- you could wind up. So -- and I came
 to the house of -- Volo dya was the guy™s  
name, and his cousin, and I was greeted like 
I would have been hi
s brother, no l -- no 
less. His mother and sister were th ere with
 open arms, and we kissed each other, and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
7
 
 
 
 
hugged each other, that we surv
ived, and came not injured. And his mo ther gave him to 
change of her clothing, she gave me. And the 
next thing, we went that evening cut -- in 
the fi -- in the settlement there. A guy was 
playing on the harmonica
, we were dancing, 
the boys and the girls, and to me, while we 
started to drink, is the usual way it would 
have been at the time, a
nd it was -- i-it was not regular vodka, it was homemade brew, 
sort of, to speak. And I don™t 
know, no matter what I drank,
 somehow or other, I didn™t 
get drunk. My mind was so busy th ink -- to th
ink, wh ere do I go from here? And it™s not 
any other way that I could expl
ain this, I just did not have 
a resoluting, I want to go and 
do this, I want to go look to do this. In a wa
y, I felt sorry for myself immediately . Look, 
here [indecipherable] he had 
a place to come, he had a moth
er, he had a sister, he had 
cousins, he had -- wh at about me? I did not ha
ve anyone in -- or anywhere™s to turn, to 
say to myself, I™m happy. We met, we are go
od. But everything was sort of like it would 
not have been real. It just lik
e a fantasy that you dream about,
 or stuff like this here. So I, 
again, was very mixed. I worked with him a wh
ole week on the farm. It was p o tatoes they 
do, because at the time of yea
r. It™s September when we are talking about, and at that 
particular time, farmers pick the potatoes th
ere, and so on, because the other grain was 
already picked. And really, theneed for help was in -- in 
a very bad way, because his 
mother an-and -- and his sister 
could not attend to  it. So in 
a way, I was a handy helper, 
hel -- helping hand there. And to  me at that 
particular time, a certai
n fantasy got into my  
mind again, why would I want to continue 
as a Jew? And immediately I saw a -- a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
8
 
 
 
 
different horizon, sort of, in a way of spea
k. Look at it. We both for the war, he was 
against Nazism, he escaped to the partisans beca
use he did not want to be drafted to go to 
Germany, to work with the Na
zis. But look what had happene
d to  the two of us. I had no 
one to co me to, he comes back home. And 
he going an d work ing, and co ming at night, 
between meeting up with the boys and the girls.
 Like I say, a certain fantasy, I -- I call it 

the fantasy, because real, I was not looking for 
that. So I must call it 
a fantasy got into my 
mind, and th at™s what I thought, who knows?
 Maybe I™m going to  get lost right now to 
these new world, and forget ab
out the world that I lived in
. And come Friday, the whole 
thing came to a change, whereupo
n Vo lodya says to me, ﬁHarol
d, aren™t you going to go 
to Darechen?ﬂ Darechen mean
ing the city nearby -- not so
 nearby, but from where the 
ghetto was. And he knew these partisan
s, these same  guys from Dar echen fought 
together. Wh ere he says to me, ﬁAren™t you go
ing to see your Jews, over there?ﬂ He all of 
a sudden out of nowhere came out, while we were discussing -- I was discussing to 

myself, what happens Sunday
 now? Their church was still on over there, it was not 
destroyed, and what if he asks me  -- I go 
with him on the farm
, and work  with him 
together. I associate in  the same g roups of 
people. What will it be, 
how will I feel if I™m 
asked to go to the church w
ith him together? And I did not know at the mo me nt, so wh en 
he start talk ing about, and using that word, 
you Jews, instead of using the wo rd, aren™t 
you going go see our friends, the 
partisans, over in Darechen? 
You know wh at I mean, or 
maybe naming someone? But he said you Jews
. So I felt a separation going on, and I -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
all of a sudden I awakened like from a dream, and says, ﬁWait a mi nute now, I cannot 
hide my self.ﬂ Oh, I cannot run away , because e
ach sort of day is something th at it isn™t 
totally open. And I immediately said to him, 
ﬁOf course I want to see, but you know how 
we work ed every day lo ng ho
urs, and hard wo rk, how was 
I to disrupt you and me from 
that work , and ask you about
 going to  Darechen? Bu t sinc
e you don™t plan on work ing 
perhaps tomorrow,ﬂ because Satu
rday -- I did not observe S-
Saturday, so anything like 
that at that time, becau se under the Soviets, 
religion was another part
 of life th at you did 
not practice. So I said to him, ﬁIf time perm
its you, I will be very happy that you give it 
to me, and I will also ask you to 
please let me go to
 the cemetery.ﬂ 
Q: Before we go on, let me ju
st footnote here that -- that yo
u told this story in the first 
interview, and -- and I™m -- I™m glad you™re 
telling it again, because you™re giving so me 
more details that are -- that are interesting, 
and that are helping to  -- to clarify what was 
going on. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: But -- but we should just probably move on from -- 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- from that area, rather th
an going into telling the whole 
story. I just wonder if you 
have any mo re. I know you -- 
you went -- well, for one thi
ng, I wo ndered if you -- you 
told in th e first video how you ha
d -- how you had left, and Vo lodya. 
A: Volodya, yeah. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
10
 
 
 
 
Q: And did you ever see him again after that? 
A: I -- I did since we wound up work -- after 
all, after the two weeks were up, we were 
back in Boronivitch, he
 to the militia. We went on the sa
me train, at the same time. But 
from Darechen, I did not return
 back to his farmland. I onl
y told him, I says, when -- 
we™ll meet at it -- because I ha
d to go to Zelbo, which is -- was the name, to tak e the train 
and to go to Bo ronivitch. So we said we™
ll meet approximately th
e same time . It so 
happened  th at we did meet on the station,
 and we went with the same train to 
Boronivitch, while he went to
 the militia. His cousin didn™t
 go -- di -- wa -- didn™t take 
the job there, so he remained separately. He
, as a matter of fact, volunteered coming back 
to the army , you know? And we met back in
 Boronivitch, but it was not any longer in 
Boronivitch that we met as quickly, or as 
frequently as we wanted . And another thing I 
want to point out here, be for wh at he aske
d me, pertaining, as a I pointed out to the 
question, you Jews. I did 
not want to carry that as a stick , 
sort of to punish him with that, 
or asking him why did he say 
it, because in my mind, I saw the natu ral thing of it. You 
know, other words, it™s I and you, and he sort 
of was not ready to hear from me , or to see 
from me, that hey Volodya, what 
do you mean you, or this, that and the other, we are just 

one, and I™m working the same way. So I did 
not take up any time. So when ever I would 
meet up with him, we meet -- we would me
et again like yesterday™s friends, and not any 
criticism w h atsoever, because I to
ok it in my heart a justifiabl
e way, the way he said it. 
He didn™t prepare himself to  make a speech. He just said
 about the way he felt. So 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
therefore, I never criticized it, or take -- took
 it [indecipherable]. So yes they would meet. 
Now, I don™t know whether I told you that I 
got married, after which -- in January, I don™t 
know in the previous tape did I mention about it? 
Q: Yes, you did. 
A: I believe I did. 

Q: You did. 

A: That on January five we got married -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- and the way I took in my  hands, because 
I still was a reckless type of a person, even  
organized, and work ing the KG B. But certain in
stincts from the partisans, that you have 
to make decisions, still were left in me, and it 
was a hard time for me to get rid of it, that 
I™m constantly under the saluting, and un
der the comma nd, and -- and th -there is a 
program that I have to do. So th e same thi
ng happen wh en  I get married -- when I wanted 
to go and get married. Three times I applied,
 and they  didn™t let me give, so I decided, 
hey, nobody™s going to 
hold me back, and -- and later, wh
en I come back they arrest me, 
but the co lonel comes, and releases me 
within -- and wants to put my  commanding 
officer there in -- in my place 
in jail, because he says, ﬁHe was legitimately that he three 
times asked you, and you an swer -- why didn™t 
you let him go?ﬂ He says to him, ﬁI did 
not have anybody to  replace 
his work, he was doing th e work  for three people.ﬂ So he 
says, ﬁWhat did you do on those days that he
 was not here? When he was -- went away to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
get married ?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he says, ﬁit was very ha
rd, you know, but I mean to manage.ﬂ He 
says, ﬁSo you see, you could ha
ve managed, you could have sa
id to him, you can only get 
three days, four days, two days
, so therefore you are the gu
ilty, and not Harold,ﬂ and he 
asked me at that particular tim
e, as I -- my name at the time
 was Grigory Grisher, they -- 
everybody used to call me Haro
ld , my  n ame b ecame in  t h e US
A. So -- and therefore, in 
my heart, all this here handling, was alr
eady a premonition of how 
I will escape, because 
I -- I appreciated the Soviet Union, that it gave 
me the opportunity to save my life, as well 
as so many mo re other Jews, that it could 
save their life and not 
be annihilated by th e 
Nazis. But at the same time, I didn™t think 
that I owe them my life since I didn™t agree 
with the Communistic system
. Communism was a very strange bedfellow in my  mind. 
Even they tried to ingrain me through the 
school, and so on, but I -- I-I just didn™t -- 
didn™t go follow that. So that particular time,
 the animosity that I bui
ld up in myself, of 
the way th e system works was already -- I wa
s looking fo r that window, and especially, 
as I aforementioned before, when I went to re
gister, and in the registration I find out that 
it -- being -- working with KG B I sort of -- not that I didn™t think it couldn™t happen, I 
didn™t believe that it would happen, becaus
e it was a -- an official thing, posted 
everywhere, that anybody who was living in 
Poland before 1939, 
and th ey wished to 
return back can do it. But all of a sudden, I 
was called in, and with
 a locked door, as 
anybody who wrote about authoritarian gove
rn ments, or Communism the way, and the 
boss kept me from 10 in the morning til five o™clock, and questi
oning me about every 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
13
 
 
 
 
little detail, which I sense that he wants to fi
nd something wrong in 
me, so he could go 
ahead. Although he did not have a good reason,
 if he wanted to jail me, he could. But 
somehow or other, he wanted to
 make a goo -- case for himsel
f, and he couldn™t break me 
down . That not breaking down  gave me a fever. I don™t know wh at I reme mb ered saying 
that, about all of that. 

Q: Yeah. No, we -- we do have this stor
y on tape, and -- did 
you have something 
particular that you wanted -- wanted to sa
y about that, because you -- we did get that 
story [indecipherable] 
A: Well, if you have that st
ory, so you know I escaped -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- and I escaped to Bialystok, wh
ich it was the firs
t stop to Poland. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I later fo und out that a -- KGB had sent tw
o guys, which both of 
them are still alive, 
one in Israel, and one is in -- is -- is in th e USA, that they were chasing after me to find 
me in Bialystok, and there, one day -- y-you 
know what I mean, from Bialystok I realized 
-- I met a friend of mine, and I wanted to go in
to city where -- in 1939, from where I sort 
of -- we -- we were chased out from there, be
cause it became Third Reich, and finding in 
Bialystok a friend that we went
 to school with together, he forewarned me, he says, 
ﬁHarold, please. You survived
 the war, why do you want to
 go back and get killed?ﬂ 
Because he mentioned me somebody who went in
to th e city, and he did not hard ly live a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
14
 
 
 
 
day before they killed him. 
And I must p-put in a note w
hy that happened the way it 
happened. After all, so
mebody took away our homes, somebody took
 away our business. 
They  did not want to have any witnesses to co
me back to claim it 
back. And the fact is 
wa -- I didn™t. I didn™t receive any money. 
All this time, while 
people got money from 
Germany, and I didn™t because I didn™t regist
er til ma -- at the tim
e, when 1952 was the 
deadline. So  therefore, I understood th e situa
tion why. I did not want
 at that particular 
time, risk my life, an d I listen 
to him, and realizing that -- since th at it™s -- what is going 
on, I wanted to go deeper. And 
the reason I wanted to go deep
er, I wanted to go a little bit 
more close, I came there for to Lódz, which 
it was a big industrial city before the war. 
And it was not totally destroyed during the wa
r, it was some left over there, because that 
was the trend so rt of -- some people, I met so
me more people over 
there that I knew from 
before, and we found out that™s the place to 
go. While being in Lódz
, I meet up the Major 
Shpark, which it was his name, and he was the 
one also, who were after me to look in 
Minsk, because I was distrusted. To straight
en up for the record was, that at th at 
particular time when I made my papers, th
e new papers, I no longer was Zuch erman, but 
my  n ew n ame was Z is sman , as I  
held to present. So, in other 
wo rds, I had to change my   
name in order to get the documents from th
e Polish commission to transfer me. But under 
the name of Zissman, there was no
 record for them to go and listen, or ask, so therefore 
that™s what it helped me. I don™t believe I told it 
in the first recording, in that particular -- 
Q: You did mention that too. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And I wo ndered if you had ever though
t of changing your na
me back from Zissman 
after you arrived in the States? 
A: I -- I was telling -- to tell you the truth, it 
was a grave mistake at 
that particular time, 
because I was so in -- I became 
to the United States, already 
had a child, and it™s sort of, 
what is it, we™re going to mix up a whole th
ing, you know what I mean? So to me it 
wasn™t that far of my name, what -- what go
od is that going to  m
e? And I remained with 
that name, however, at any time I 
tell my story, I -- or I file a
pplications, or so, I still refer 
to that my  birth name was Zuch erman, and -- and my  regular name was Zissman, the 
adopted name was Zissman. And it™s -- it beca
me a joke to me. Z-Zissman from German 
means sweet, and Zucherman means from suga
r. So in other words I always joke the 
sugar became sweeter, that™s why I used th
e name Zissman, and that was not too far 
fetched, you know what I mean, to do it. So 
I left it the way it is. So, after, in Lódz, 
meeting that Shpark , within a couple of days
, I was in touched with a for -- with the 
former fighters of the partisan, and this 
ma -- people who already had formed the 
Zionistic party again, and the 
option was -- as they -- as it wa
s called, the runners. They 
were there, tha -- from Hebrew
 Bricha. Anybody who ran away
 right now, and looked for 
an identity of where to
 go, and the -- the -- this -- the w
hole thing led us, the goal was to 
reach Israel, one way or the other, because we
 sort of -- no matter how I looked at it, 
Europe was an insecure place, because any 
country, other than Po
land, I found had the

same story, Jews were killed.
 It was only a matter of the percentages. And unfortunately, 
out of the six million, three millio n were kille
d in -- in Poland, because they corroborated 
mu ch mo re than the people in ot
her countries did, and -- and th
at was the results of it. So 
basically my zeal at that particular time wa
s, end goal, to reach 
Israel, and I enlisted 
myself with the illegal party -- not ill -- it™s not
 the party, it was the part -- the Zionistic 
party, that they were doin
g, that helped to help th
ose -- those who ran away, the 
runaways, sort of, to bring th
em in this year. And they  accepted me, and imme diately 
they made me the head of 10 mo re guys [ind
ecipherable] and when we came from there, 
we -- from Lódz, we were sent to Kraków. 
And from Kraków, wh ic
h is not too far from 
Czechoslovakia, we came to Cz
echoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, the Red Cross, which I 
met for the first time -- othe
rwise, during th e war, I did not 
even know that
 the Red Cross 
existed, or anything like that. I knew that 
-- that it existed, but 
meaning not to speak 
derogatorily about it, there wa
s no such th ing wh erever the ghettos was, anything to  see 
the sign of a Red Cross, as they
 should be the -- the -- the pe
ople to help th e Jews in any 
kind of way. But, so for the 
first time in Czechoslovakia, 
I have seen a Red Cross, and 
they had a kitchen open for ma
ny runaways, because people we
re changing from -- either 
that they were working in 
Germany, or they were ensl
aved for the -- in Germany, 
whatever it is that everybody 
was returning home. So the tra
ffic back and forth from cu -- 
in countries existed, and the Red Cross, at that
 particular time, was available to give us a 
little helping hand. And they made
 us ID™s, and the destinati
on of that particular time, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
17
 
 
 
 
was to go to Hu ngary, Budape
st, from there. And we were on 
the train, and I don™t know 
what I mentioned th at on th e train we ran in
to  some drunken Soviet soldiers, you know 
what I mean, and that we had -- since we -- I 
had mo re partisans with me, so we had to do 
what we had to do. And to save our wo me
n that we -- were with us, or the whole 
operation, that we were on an illegal way, 
and we just -- when we were going near a 
river, we just shoved them down on -- over th
e -- into the river. I don™t know wh at it was, 
the outco me of it, but we were [indecipherabl
e] then the train stopped at Budapest, our 
minds, of the five of us that were there, we
re really thinking, who knows whether we may 
not hear a little call, 
because in Hungary still, the Soviet
s were occ -- on the occupation at 
that particular time. B u t, since it was quiet
, we went to the comm
unity at that time, 
Communitaes rilita, an d there sort of was anencampment for us where to sleep. And for 

the first time, we organized. Th
e fo llowing mo r -- day, that a demonstration that we are 
going to go to the consulate, which it was ov
er there, British consulate, already in 
existence, and we made a protest march, decl
aring that Israel is supposed  to become a 
state, so therefore it could hous
e all it™s refugees, as we were 
to so many years, driven out 
historically from Israel, and is a time of our
 return to -- back to
 our homeland, from our 
ancestors.  
Q: How many people were in
volved in that march?  
A: I give or take, not coming, because on th e 
train, the whole group consisted of -- were 
over a hundred, but people of ru naways that we
re already there in -- in Budapest at the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
18
 
 
 
 
time, ready to go to Bucharest, because the rout
e at that particular time, called for us to 
go to  Bu charest, Romania. And being that th
ey were ca -- boarding 
near the ocean, from 
there we would illegally send them
 on ships, to go illegally to Pa
lestine, as it was called, 
not Israel, but Palestine at the time, as it -- as
 it™s -- historically the name of the area was 
called Palestine. So -- but they  changed on us
 in the middle. So to tell you ap proximately, 
the demonstration had at least 
about 200 people, at the event,
 in rows, orderly. Israeli 
flags were gi -- made to us, and we had inscri ptions at that time of saying that -- that 
Israel should beco me a state. So it became to 
me, a new era of life, that all of a sudden, 
while I was not going where I™m going, I had some
 -- I had a goal in my life, I had some -
- of re-establishing my self. And I felt ve
ry good about it, you know? And it was -- the 
marl thing was good, it -- my wife accompanied me
, she did not sort of resist all of this, I 
think. She was in the same mind and mood, as 
to what I was doing. So, i-it sort of -- now 
I™m not by myself any more, I™m the -- we are 
two, and sort of it made a little bit my life 
easier, because I no longer was that one person 
like a stone in the dese
rt. I use that word 
because that™s my feelings of 
the way it used to be. So now we
 -- we were a team. Just for 
the sake of it, I don™t know wh ether I told it in the other, we met our rabbi, who married 
us in her hometown, and he was apart over 
there to, where we were sleeping on bunk 
beds, and we were on the top,
 he was at the botto m, the bunk bed broke, and I almo st -- 
he got injured from a nail from 
that, but not badly. But it was like I said, that little fun 
that we had to [indecipherable] accident
s that had happen ed. And by that day -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
19
 
 
 
 
Q: It was in Budapest? 
A: In Budapest, yeah. When  we were in Bu
dapest, let me describe it to you. Over the 
Buda, there was not a single brid ge, only pantoo
n bridges were left from the army, that 
[indecipherable] to cross over. They started al
ready on -- work ing on restoring bridges, 
but that™s how it was. It was fresh after th
e war, and one could see the difference what it 
was in Poland, the way it -- it looked like -- th
ere we saw shops, all of a sudden, you can 
go in  and shop. So  what I didn™t see in Boro niv
itch, or I didn™t see back in Poland, even -- 
you know what I mean, the whole thing was in
 markets, outdoor markets, it w as in Lódz, 
or in Bialystok in the same way. Here, I saw  
an organized thing like this here, that wa -- 
sure it was destroyed the Buda
, you know, but the civilian 
housing was not
 damaged as 
badly to say. And in  -- say there were apar
tments, and people were shoppers, there was 
market. All of a sudden, we were given at th
at particular time, sa
lamis and everything to  
take with us, after they changed us route not to
 go to Bucharest, but 
to go to Gratz. And 
the fun part was in Gratz was different orde
rs. We were going -- our documents make -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
A: -- and the -- th-the most -- most likely wa
s to cross over to the English zone, but the 
Soviets still were there. So we to ld the supplie
s, the food supplies that were given to us to 
take to that hotel, we co ming to  that hotel, we 
turn it into the kitchen,
 and then  we had to 
worry about food for ourselves 
to eat. Something else happened in  that hotel, wh ich I do 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
20
 
 
 
 
not know what I said to the 
other -- on the other tape, but I 
-- let™s forget what I said on 
the other tape, I want to tell it now, because th
at was very important. We came in there, 
and that was the English zone. We
 were -- we were told that 
if we ever go thro ugh to  the 
English zone, we must be very polite and quiet
. And as we were going to the hotel, our 
orders were we only go in groups of two and 
three, and nobody is to speak at all, if 
possible. If you do speak, manage to speak
 German. If you do not speak German, you 
mu st speak another language, sort of, beca
use we would be going there as we are 
Austrian Jews. Therefore, Austrian Jews  returning back from concentration camp, 
therefore it would have been no
 questions asbay cause at the 
time, th e police there, when 
it was, shied away from all of these things, sort of as to wash 
themselves of all the 
atrocities against the Jews they did. Anyways, 
we came to a hotel, a
nd for the first time, I 
met there in the hotel, a representative fro m the American Joint Committee, w h ich they 

were there to help the refugees. I also me
t a p arty faithful over there, and I brem -- I 
remember he -- Pinhaus was his name, he wa
s with red hair. So, between the two of 
them, that was the command. In other words, 
the Zionist side, the American aide side, 
and so on. 

Q: Excuse me, are you talking abou
t the Joint Distri
bution Committee? 
A: Committee, yeah, that they 
were, that particular time, already there in that hotel. We 

go in to that hotel, we were housed wh ere we
 should go, and before
 long I meet up over 
there a guy who was a guide, and he was with us
 in the forest, the pa
rtisans. In a way it 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
21
 
 
 
 
was a ray of sunshine, you know
? Lusek, I speak to him -- and I hear that he™s guiding -- 
I ask him first, I was -- wanted to go, ready 
with my group, I still kept the group, sort of 
like the 10, that we work togeth
er, as I said, to begin. I was their lead er, or commander, if 
you want to call it. He says
, ﬁHarold, you and Sonia, 
you got to wait a little while. 
They™ll tell you when your tu
rn comes.ﬂ And before long, since we made ourselves 
known that we are former partisans, fighters ove
r there, we get an order that we are going 

to go, and we were told we are going to go
 to come to the river Moore, which it was a 
fast river, b u t a narrow one, and we are to cross 
that river, and on the other side of that 
river, we will immediately -- immediately en
ter to the English zone. Myself, being a 
platoon commander before, and th
e other guys being partisans,
 when we hear assignment 
like this here, we did not ask any questions wh
atsoever. We were given tickets to take the 
train, and we were to go from Gratz to Klag
enford. And in Klagenfo
rd we were given the 
directions to go to the river, and there -- but
 we were told, don™t 
go like you™re marching, 
go like normal, two people again togeth er. But 
when you come to the river, immediately I 
find out that in my  group th ere were a fe
w guys who could swim, and a few guys who 
couldn™t swim at all. And we 
were with wo men and men togeth er. I decided that once we 

come there, to form a chain.
 I™ll lead the group first, I 
was a swimmer, and my wife was 
next, wh ich she was not a swimme r, and that™s
 how I made the chain to be. So, by the 
time we stretch across, even wi
th a little bit of paddling with 
our hands, we™ll be able to 
reach almost the other side. So swimming wa
s not to be very far. All of a sudden, a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
galloping horse is heard, and a commanding o
fficer, was in Soviet gear, comes over, he a 
-- makes [indecipherab le] to stop, and of all 
people, he asks us question wh at we are 
trying to  do, we are telling him we™re trying to
 swim in the river. Y
ou know what I mean?  
But of course we did not have an y bathing 
suit on, or an ything like that, we are now 
civilian, and we didn™t have 
any problems what -- that™ll ge
t wet [indeciphera
ble]. And of 
all the things, he arrests me. He arrests me, n o
w of all things in the 
world, I™m an escapee 
from the Soviet Union, and from the KGB, 
and now, I finally, at the mement -- the 
moment of re-liberation, I sh
ould fall back? But I had no a
lternative, he immediately he 
had two more on horses with hi
m, and -- and he™s already got 
a little squad, sort of, and I 
have none to say. An yway, the rest of the 
group, with  my  wife together, go back, and 
they decided to get in contact,
 now again with the hotel in th
ere, and telling them of what 
had transp ired, and th ey just -- and they to
ld that they™re sendi
ng out immediat ely, 
somebody who is going to handle the case, and 
take it over. Sure enough, within the nec -
- by the next day, I immediately am taken to th
e jail, and in the jail, all the questions and 
answers that they gave me, was th at I wanted 
to go to Klagenford, 
an d  my  aim was to  go  
further away in Italy, and I -- whichever I 
mentioned the name, they says, ﬁWell, you 
don™t have to wo rry about it, we™ll send you
 there.ﬂ But being -- working for the KGB, 
and knowing them from the time that I know 
before the war, when we were -- were in 
their zone, I knew th at when  the Soviets 
tell you you gonna go to
 one place, you may 
wind up in Siberia until you get there. So I di
d not have my  trust in that system, and I was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
really scared, but what could I do? I was -- no wa
y for me to break out, I did not have in -
- any money, or anypla -- anything at all. So
 I figured I got to wait for time, an d see what 
is going to be. By th e next day, it looks lik
e somebody came from there, a courier, and it 
looks like they had money, and th
ey knew how to bribe Soviet 
officials at that particular 
time, and they paid up, [inde
cipherable] for my freedom, a
nd they let me out. When we 
came back to the hotel, I organized my 10
 guys, immediately I posted to each door 
exceeding that hotel, I says, ﬁEverybody stay, 
as the guy told me that nobody™s going to  
go out. Whoever is going to  come in, you™ll kn
ow. Because we are not going to let -- be 
mistreated. We, because we were former fight
ers, are not going to 
be let into another 
situation like that. Josef Lusek is the name of
 the guy. The way he takes the other, we are 
going, and they™re go
ing to take us tonight, not tomorro
w.ﬂ I came in with an ultimatum 
to the office, and I told them, I says, ﬁI 
have guard s in all the exits from my  guys, 
nobody™s going to go out.ﬂ I 
says, ﬁYou dealing with former
 partisans. And remember, 
our ch  -- our duty did not finish as yet, we are 
not in Israel as yet, an d that™s what we™re 
aiming to be. I™m not going to let you guys
 play with our lifes
 any longer. Nobody is 
going out of the hotel tonight.ﬂ And I spoke 
-- meanwhile, Lusek comes over, he tried to 
calm me down, and he says, ﬁH
arold, I know your wife fro
m days past, before I knew 
you. I™ll take you,ﬂ -- my wife, I says, ﬁNever
 mind to all of these here things, ﬁMy group 
goes with  you, and you are going to be resp
onsible for all of us. If anything foul plays 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
[indecipherable] rememb
er, we are not going to remain
 silent. You know us from the 
forest.ﬂ  
Q: Let me ask you something here. Were the 
other people in the hotel that Lusek was 
taking across -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- were they involved
 with the Bricha also, 
or was this just -- 
A: They were involved just like we refuge
es, who looking to go fo rward to Israel. 
However, there were people with money, 
people who went smuggling while I was 
working with idealism, and they
 were mi -- Black Marketeeri
ng, and they already got so 
many -- ma de money, and ab out it, and ma 
-- and you know, it was 
payola, immediately 
went into existence at that pa
rticular time. And I found it out
 quickly, and this is where I 
made a point, I banged the table in the -- in th
e office, and I told  him, ﬁNo, it™s not going 
to go on like that. I speak for my group. I™m
 their leader, and that™s what is gonna be. 
And tonight, if any plans you have about leav
ing any group, I don™t care who th e others 
are, we are going,ﬂ and Lusek, he was -- I cal
led him into -- be in presence, so I says, 
ﬁYou know. You the leader, a
nd you the guide, but command, I will have. I and my wife 
will be -- ride next to you a
nd your wife.ﬂ She was there, 
too. And remember, there will 
be no foul play. So  he told us, ﬁWe™ll have to
 enter a barn. In that 
barn in the mountains 
over there, is where the Soviets 
[indecipherab le] are there, we have to bribe him, we have 
to pay him -- pay him off, and therefore they™
ll let the group go thro
ugh.ﬂ And he warned 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
us, ﬁThey will -- they pr
obably may body search you, and 
if they find anything of value, 
they might take it away, they may liquida
te it. Don™t ma ke a resistance, because 
otherwise you™ll spoil the whole operation.ﬂ I 
really did not have mu ch, but at the same 
time, a ring f -- we had from my father and mo
ther, we had a watch, and so on. So my  
wife, what she did, she had some yarn, you 
know what I mean, for 
knitting a sweater, so 
on. So she to ok some of th
e valuables, made a ball out 
of it, you know wh at I mean, 
wrapped it inside, so in a way we figured th at
 what so. Then we ca
me to that barn, like 
you said, anyways -- I rushed a 
little bit too fast. They accept
ed my -- what I dema -- my 
demands, and my  group was going with th at -- 
the whole group to gether mu st have been 
about another 20 people, so we were a big colu
mn, and when we came 
to that barn, like I 
said, which he explained that to us, we star
ted -- they started to body search us, you know 

what I mean, and so on. So  happened that to 
my group, nobody had a
ny valuables, really, 
to wo rry about. We did not try to acquired it in
 that time that we were involved with. Bu t, 
there were some people who 
had to pay off, you know, gi
ve this, and we became 
knowledgeable before wa
tid. Now, we already on the other side of the barn, and we™re 
ane on the English zone, p
hysically. We walked for -- 

Q: I want to remind you th at we do have all 
of this on the other tape, so we don™t -- 
A: You still have that? 

Q: Yeah, we have -- 

A: Okay, so not -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
Q: -- we have all of th -- we have everythi
ng up until when you left for the United States. 
A: Okay . 
Q: But -- but I just had a few, focused questi
ons, so we don™t want to go over everything 
again. 

A: Ask me any questions
, and I™ll answer them. 
Q: One th ing was -- well, I did have another 
question about your march in Budapest, you 
had mentioned. 
A: Yes? 
Q: Did anything come -- become of that? You had -- you had a couple hundred people 

marching. 
A: Well, the only thing was it was so new a th
ing that it never existed before. Later on I 
found out that these type of marches existe
d also in Romania, and perhap s in other 
sources. But it was totally new to us, and it 
was totally new in Budapest for something 
like that to happen. Ab
solutely we must say that later 
on, you know, I™ve told -- we are 
talking right now about 1945, you know it -- Is
rael didn™t become a state til 1948, but you 
know that in the intervening ye
ars, of these three years, a lo
t of demonstrations of that 
type begin to  happen, be in Europe, be in is -- 
be in isra -- not Israel, but Palestine, or in 
the United States of this same
 way, until the resolution finally
 came to pass, that Israel 
was granted statehood. So I mean, it was -- p e
rhaps it -- I di -- canno
t claim that it was -- 
we were the beginners of that, but be -- becaus
e later I found out that similar things went 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
on. So I don™t want to go ah ead to take a fi
rst eenadida, but it was a first in Budapest, 
where it should happen. 
Q: Did you -- you were obviously 
preparing to go to is -- Pa
lestine. Didyou have very 
strong feelings at the time, about going to Palestine? 

A: Abso lutely, as in my former tape, I said
 I was -- since childhood,
 and in the school I 
graduated, Yaven in Po land, Zionism was imbe
dded in me. I -- I ha
d to hide it through 
Hitlerite times, and I had to 
hide it in the time of the Sovi
et™s occupation, which it was -- 
I know they called it liberation, but let™s -- le
t -- let it be for history to  judge, whether it 
was occupational, or it was liberation. But inside
, that spark lit up, at that particular time 
in Lódz. No  sooner I met up in -- you know, 
in found that former
 shamring, you know 
what I mean? Which it was    that it was sh
ameratsyer, that it wa
s a youth organization 
belonging to  the Zionist organization, and th
at spark kept through me, it was the new 
thing, just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto, and become a resister, and 

fight the Nazis, this is how it 
was, the new fighting th at it became in me, and I assume in 
the rest of the guys that are war with me, be
cause when  people reso
rted themselves to go 
on train -- to a -- rooftops, and on the steps to
 go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable] 
on their shoulders, and speeds 
of the trains  maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour, maybe 60, t-
times 50, doesn™t matter the speed. Bu t it was dangero us, it was a dangerous mission to 

do. But it was a goal in our hearts imbedded,
 that we must go to see for freedom and 

liberty for ourselves, someplace where we coul
d be safe from annihilation, and so on.

Q: So, what I didn™t understand from the in
 -- the video then, was how -- how you a -- 
came to agree to go to 
the United States, rather
 than to Palestine. 
A: I™ll tell you that, because 
it was deception in the party. 
While I was working in Italy, 
sending illegals away, and one 
day I came telling them that
 my wife became pregnant. 
When I told them abou
t the news, they say -- and I want
 to go with my
 group, illegals, 
they says, ﬁNo, Haro ld, you stay here on th
e point, you™re doing very good, and we are 
expecting to get legal passage. We will send yo
u the first thing -- you know what I mean, 
for legal passage.ﬂ I su ccumbed to that, becaus
e to me it sound very
 real, the words that 
they were telling me, an-and I was -- what we were doing in the kibbutzim is preparing 
them for Israel, and so on. However, the da
y came, and the free passage, as we called 
them, certificates at that par
ticular time became -- and I come
 to Rome, to find out what™s 
going on, I hear that as they 
were passing out certificates to
 some people, but all of a 
sudden, I came and I asked my  man in charge, ﬁWhat happened to  me, and my  wife?ﬂ He 

says, ﬁWell, there wasn™t enough this time, but
 we expect pretty soon to  have mo re.ﬂ And 
at that particular time, you 
know, it was already -- of co urse
, she was not -- she probably 
mu st have been -- give or take at that pa
rticular time, maybe in
 her fifth month, you 
know, because I™m -- I™m not co
unting at this time the times.
 I came the second time to 
Rome, when the next batch of certificates ca
me, and all of a sudden, people begin to 
laugh at me . They  s-say, ﬁOh,
 Harold, you don™t want to go 
to  Israel any mo re, you trying 
to go to America.ﬂ You deceived the Zionist or
ganization. And I felt really, in my  heart, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062

that somebody put me down too lo w, it was 
too much. So then I 
said to my  commanding 
officer, ﬁI™ll tell you, I™m resigning my  post. I 
am going to register to go for Israel -- for 
United States, instead of going 
to Palestine.ﬂ At that partic
ular time, they start pleading 
with me, ﬁOkay, if you want to go to Pales
tine, fine, but we still w a
nt you to go on a no -- 
a kibbutz near Rome.ﬂ Where -- that story is 
printed in  one of the 
books that -- for my -- 
one of my  men, who was in my  platoo
n, his name was Kigernovitch, Mosh e 
Kigernovitch, and he described pa
rt of that stor -- that story.
 He pleaded with  me at that 
time to write the [indecipherable] personal thing th at I wrote in my  manuscript, but I was 

not ready and I couldn™t try it.
 At that particular time I 
was not ready to sit down  and 
write my life™s story. That™s why I refused,
 but h -- I have -- he recorded it with my 
picture, and him, and acknowledging th at 
I was   the comoon -- platoon commander, or 
commandeers ruddid, way they  say it in -- in 
Russian. And it™s in his book. Un fo rtunately 

the book is only written in Yidd
ish, and it never been translat
ed, because he is writing not 
just about the forest where we were, he is
 writing about a lot of other forests, the 
partisans, Jewish partisans exis
ted, because he wanted  for hi
storical sake, to acknowledge 
that Jews did fight in the partisans, and Jews 
participated in resistance, okay? So, at that 

particular time, as we are right now which you
 asking me the question, I had Zionism in 
me, but it was dormant for these years, because 
I had to, but as soon -- the sooner -- it got 
ignited very easily, they -- some
body did not have to sort of
 hit me, and to say, ﬁHey 
Harold, what are you doing?ﬂ I was right there,
 and I was willing to risk, in those days,

my  life. So therefore, when  he put me down, 
I says, ﬁNo, I™m not going to sw ay things to 
send others to go illegally,ﬂ which it was a lo
t of hardship with 
going through illegally. 
ﬁAnd I am going to  s -- go to America. So th
erefore, I™m resigning, and that™s all.ﬂ I 
therefore enlisted myself at that
 time to come to Florence, Ital
y, which I joi -- I -- I lived -
- what you sa -- everything is told, until I 
came to Italy, until the 
United States. So, you 
probably know the story, the 
way we were taken out of the 
camp there, and we were put 
it into DP camps in Italy, an
d then I, instead of being in  
a camp, was then out of the 
camp, and I worked with the illegal elleah, wh ich it was kibbutzim, and I was the leader 
there, and train them, and des
cend them. And like I say, at th
at time, when I said that, 
they say, ﬁH arold, you can go the next 
time with next group we are sid -- we are 
shipping, and you can go with 
them.ﬂ I says, ﬁAre you fo r 
real, or you ju st trying to ?ﬂ I 
says, ﬁMy wife entered already the sixth mo nt
h.ﬂ I says, ﬁIn the sixt
h month of pregnancy 
you ask me to -- I should go ahead to gamb le
 with the lives of two, my wife and the 
baby?ﬂ I says, ﬁNo, I cannot do that. Therefor
e, I refuse, andﬂ -- and that™s how I wound 
up in Florence, Italy, and I came in there, an
d started to write to 
my family. M y  mother 
had a sister here, and th ree brothers, and I 
wrote to them, and we started a whole new 
thing about it, because until now, 
all the letters that I sen t to America, never send them a -
- an address, but [indecipherable] address. I 
used to drive my  aunt crazy. She heard from 
me, and she did not know where she can correspond with me. But at that particular time, 

when we came to Florence, we in -- stop -- we  established writing through the army post, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
31
 
 
 
 
unival, and -- because the regul
ar post was still not operating 
too much. And -- and this is 
where my decision was reached that I™m going 
to go to the -- to th
e USA. Being in the 
USA, my  Zionism again did not change, I stil
l rema ined a Zionist, and as soon we landed, 
I hardly made a living, but I imme diately joined
 -- we had at that particular time, the new 
citizen club. It was an organization and a cl
ub. And we used to meet -- have meetings, 
sometimes to raise mo ney for our cause of ex
istence, people would have dances, or raffle 
tickets or so on, the usual way. And ag ain,
 it imbued in me anew, I™m a Zionist, even -- 
and someday -- I didn™t at that particular 
time talk about going to  Israel, when you 
already have a child in the United States, a
nd f -- we came in ™48,
 March 14. 22 months 
old then  my  daughter was. And the next yea
r, 1949, in September, my  son is born. So  I 
was -- looks like too busy with  having childre n instead of talking about operational way 
to go to Israel. 

Q: So it -- your family being in the United St
ates, was th at the crucial thing that made 
you come to the United States, 
rather than going to Israel? 
A: No, it was not the crucial, it w as the 
helping point. You must remember th e 
importance. I did not have money, I did not ha
ve means. We were living -- after I entered 

in Florence, we were living under the he
lp from the UNRRA, the United Nations Relief 
Organizations, that they -- but we formed th
e kibbutz. So, in other words, I want to 
explain it, as I said a little before. My Zionis
m was still there. Again, we form a kibbutz, 
even in that, while we™re waiting to go to America. I still have
 pictures to prove that, with 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
32
 
 
 
 
the name of the kibbutz, and in Florence, a
nd I was -- I have the pictures to prove I was 
speaking ab out Zionism, and how we mu st do. Although I was going to  America, but the 
support for Israel, I never -- it sto pped bei
ng a -- a dire participant belonging, even 
though today, and all through th e years sinc
e 1953, I™m a member of
 the B™nai Brith. But 
I™m still a Jew who belongs to th
e Zionist causes and so on. An
d it™s not just belonging in 
person, but with my  pocket also, you know 
wh at I mean? The Israeli bonds that I™m 
buying, or to charitable events that you kno
w, where you -- you give charity to these 
here. So, all of these here, because I changed to  bad leadership, at that particular time, so 
my  route did change, but inside of me, my  hear
t did not change a little
 bit, and I remained 
of the same way. So now, when
 I came to Chicago, and I must
 make it -- I went to high 
school -- I went to one of the best high sch
ools at the time that it 
was, it was in Austin 
High. And not to tell you th e story, as a fact
, it™s not a story, within three semesters I 

made American high school. At the same ti
me, looks like the principal says to me, how 
come I™m n o t going to go to college now, beca
use I was work ing at night. And I want you 
to understand, I made a point th ere. At six o™cl
ock in the mo rning, I used to get up, take a 
streetcar to go to work -- of course, I did no
t have a car, as yet. And from s -- fro m the 
store I used to go to  school, wh ich it was a st
reetcar, as we called it 
at that time, going all 
the way to  school. Do my  homework at that
 time, going there. School would start at 
about eight o™clock, to 10 at night, two hours
, and it was regular school. Of course, it was 
grownups, so you had a lot of 
homework to be given, and cer
tain thing would be done at 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
school, such as reading, or on the blackbo
ard to the big [indecipherable] like th e -- the 
kids [indecipherable] today. And I would co
me home, the earliest was 11 o™clock at 
night. My wife and kids were 
asleep, so my dinner, sort of 
like I said, was grabbing a bite 
in the store. I was working at that time in 
a grocery store for a brother of my  mo ther™s, 
my uncle. And that™s what it was, my routine.
 So between six in the morning, til the 11, 
or 11:30 at times, that was working, and th
en work ing with my  head, and wo rk ing so  
hard, but I established -- so like 
I said to the principal, I says
, ﬁI -- b y  all means, I™d love 
to go further myself in college
,ﬂ wh ich I never did, unfortunate
ly, but my kids did, so I™m 
happy that I did -- was a good father to my ch
ildren. And I didn™t co
mp lain or anything 
like that, and I had wa -- it was a challenging th
ing that I could achieved, to know how to  
read, and to know how to wr
ite, and you know, and that™s 
what -- and in the meanwhile, 
this -- we are talking about 1949, where my son 
is born. By 1
953, I mastered all that I had 
in me, to sit down and write my  manuscript, 
which of course, I to -- it took me a year, and 
-- and a nervous breakdown afterwards, because
 when I speak about these things, even 
now, I am not here with you 
in the good USA, I™m there, wh
ere it was. I™m th ere time, th e 
way it was. And than ks God th at I can contro
l my  emotions today better than I could in 
those years past, because it was to o fresh an 
issue, and my thing was record, and to tell 
for posterity.  

Q: Before we go on with that
, I wanted to ask you more abou
t your -- I have a couple of 
questions about Italy. You mentioned you were involved in the camp  -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
34
 
 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- administration in Modena, and you also 
mentioned you were in
volved in  organizing 
the kibbutz, with -- are those two sepa
rate things, or the same things? 
A: Separate things. 

Q: Can you tell me so mething about the ca
mp  administration? Wh at were you doing? 
A: I was in the administration, there was no sp
ecific titles. We were
 in Modena, which -- 
it was a camp from the former
 military academy, where we 
got in one day only from 
Mauthausen, Au stria, they got in trucks, 
and unloaded human cargo, just like it was 
regular cargo of something else, because they 
did not look like humans. And in th at big 
crowd, of all these people, of 5,000, from 
one truck that they unload them, and we are 
staying there on the sidewalk. That was -- a
nd please let me correct it for the recod -- it 
was still in Bolognia, we afterwards came to  
Modena. We™re standing on the outside, we 

have nothing mo re than blanke
ts or anything like that. When  my  wife points at me, she 
says, ﬁHarold, look, this man is my uncle™
s brother.ﬂ I said, ﬁCareful, how -- are you 
sure?ﬂ The man was swollen, y
ou know what I mean, and so
 on. We -- we come near, 
and she says to him, ﬁIsn™t your name,ﬂ sh
e says, ﬁyou know, Laserovitchasu n?ﬂ And he 
looks, a-and sort of somebody says something 
to me, he was not talk himself. He says, 
ﬁDon™t you have a brother Misha Mandel, he
™s my  uncle?ﬂ You know, and we got from 
there. We kept comp any with him throughout
, because from there we were ordered to go 
to Modena, and we were housed in the m
ilitary academy, that™s
™ where they made a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
35
 
 
 
 
camp. People were sleeping on the floors, la
ying. It was just like sardines. But somehow 
or other, there was no protests. The biggest prot
est what we had, th at we had a camp right 
next door to us, housing former Nazis, in ther
e -- which it was some SS with them, and so 
on. And every day it used to star
t a rumbling, with stones, bottle
s, or anything like that to 
these Nazis. The MP would come -- the Ameri
can MP would come to quelch it. And we 
told him, ﬁIf you want it to be quiet, either
 you move us to another place, or you move 
them away, because we will not
 remain,ﬂ -- to us, it was a lie that w e didn™t care if 
somebody will be arrested, or an
ything like that. But to look 
at a Nazi face on, that was 
something th at we could not let our minds to
 say, ﬁOh, it was yesterday, it was a war.ﬂ 
Because we knew the first thing, if these guys 
would have been on th
e -- this side of the 
fence, not the other, they would be more th
an happy to kill the -- 
us again, you know 
what I mean, because it was imbued in their liv
es. It was not that they seeked revenge 
because of some, there was no b
ecause. That™s what it was, 
the train ing that they got. 
Finally, with in a few days, the camp was moved,
 with  the SS, and we
 remained in that 
camp. Now, that camp was a mixture of youth
, middle aged people, pregnant, sick and 
the biggest thing being in the administration,
 what we were seekin
g for help. The army, 
of course, provided us at that
 particular time, I must say,
 with blankets, and so on, 
because they couldn™t rebuild
 it -- the -- the military academ
y, but they gave us help. 
Q: Which -- which army? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
36
 
 
 
 
A: The US army. The US
 army  was stationed in Florence
, in -- not in -- not Florence, I 
mean in -- in Modena at that particular tim
e. T h ere was also the -- part of the British 
army, which it was attached to 
them, which the Israeli part wa
s a part of them, too, and 
they were the ones, as I men
tioned, brought us into Italy 
from Austria, and it was also 
over there, a part of the Polish -- a -- a Polis
h -- a part of the Polish army, which it was 
along with the Britain. So we ha
d at least one thing, since we 
didn™t speak Italian at that 
particular time. But we could sp eak Hebrew 
to these here, we could speak Polish to the 
other soldiers, and they all were, in  a way, I mu
st confess, they were all trying to help us 
one way or the other, but wh en we [indeciph
erable] on it for anything and everything, 
looks like the patience va --  to
 say be patient was not the 
right answ er. And I, being in  
the administration, had the opportunity  to s ee a person from the jewi -- Joint Distribution 

Committee, but she was in an English -- a Bri
tish uniform. How that came about, or what 
-- that she was not with the American army
, I don™t know. I cannot go in to details. And 
she came to  the -- to our place where we woul
d meet, and she asked us the question, wh at 
could we help you? And I asked her at that
 time, I said, ﬁWhere should I start?ﬂ So 
therefore, I™ll start and tell you. We have here 
young people, at the ages of about 14 - 15 - 
16. You got to reme mber, these people were ta
ken to the camps, as -- as kids. Now th ey 
are teenagers. Through the -- 
through the -- if anybody was 
10 years of age, you got to 
imagine he is now -- I says -- we -- we -- 
we encountered venereal disease in there 
means, because it was ope
n prostitution in Italy, you know, 
on the street. But these kids 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
37
 
 
 
 
did not know, you know wh at I mean, any be
tter, they were not brought -- I says, ﬁSo 
therefore, I™ll make my biggest request to you
, let™s take the kids out of the camp.ﬂ And 
before long, which ag ain I have
 pictures to prove you -- th
at point, if at any time you 
interested, but since we are doi
ng it just for -- on a tape like that, but if you would be 
interested, I will be more than 
happy to supply with 
copies of the pictures, where, at this 
particular time, the Palestine brigade, or the 
Jewish brigade, as it was called, which it was 
attached to the British fifth 
army, came in to he
lp, not the Joint Distribution Committee, 
and with their trucks, which 
you will see on the pictures, I™
ll -- I™ll show them to you 
afterwards, which with their tr
ucks, we took the kids, and we
 shi-shipped them out to a 
separate camp to make a camp, where they c
ould be tended to th e needs those youngsters 
were needing, and they were 
the first ones to be shipped ev
en illegally to Israel, by means 
that we were not even aware of how, but th
ey shipped them out, a
nd they gave them the 
treatment that needed . The next thing was we send -- 
End of Tape One, Side B 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
38
 
 
 
 
Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape number two, side A, of 
an interview with  Haro
ld Zissman. Okay, go 
ahead. 
A: All the others, the grownups, who remained
 on the waiting list, or what it may become 
later, some of them were integr
ated through the parties, becau
se I must confess, the party 
system immediate -- immediately  began  . . . 
immediately the parties began, even it was 
camp life, and th ere was the Revisionist party,
 the a -- the Ashumer party, in other words 
meaning Jharbortinsk y™s party to the right, and it was to the middle, and to th e left. And it 

could be visible to those of us
 who were working in the admini
stration, and to those of us 
who were organized, that it was immediately my people, your people, and so on. Bu t it™s 
one thing I mu st confess. The harmony fo r the 
good of the cause existed. It was not an 
open bipartisan, it not -- b-but it was bipartis
an. Everybody understo
od the need of the 
time, and so on. From there,
 it started to group out, from the big camp there. The 
kibbutzim, it started at that tim
e. I at that particular time 
joined a seminar which -- it was 
near Milano, and there were instructions to  be taught to  us. Professor -- there was a 
professor over there, I gotta th
i -- I gotta think of his name. 
Q: Fir -- Garfinkel? 
A: Garfinkel. Oh, you know
 already [indecipherable] 
Q: You -- you did -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
39
 
 
 
 
A: You know my  story about it. I™m glad 
that you™re aware about my  story. Yeah, 
Professor Garfinkel, he was a li
ght to us, explaining and teac
hing us, and a lot of these 
things went into our head very
 well. Even though, 
at that particular time, I did not think 
of anything else but Ashumer, meaning the part
y to the left, as I started in the youth 
organization. I couldn™t help it, I was with th
em, and I could sense in that semi nar, that 
that seminar was orchestrated by my  party, or 
so -- and I mean -- in other words, the party 
to the left. So -- 
Q: I have a question about -- y-you talked in
 the other interview ab
out recruiting -- about 
being involved with recruiting 
the young people to go to 
Israel, with these groups. 
A: Well [indecipherable] 

Q: So you did -- you talked a
bout it some, and I wanted to kn
ow -- this is kind of a -- a 
question that -- that you might have somethi
ng to  say about and you might not, but I™ve 
heard some talk about -- about th ere bei
ng discrimination in Israel against camp  
survivors, and that there was some  looking 
down on camp  survivors in particular because 

of wh at they had been  through. Did you witness any of that? 
A: Well, I can tell you that mu ch. Being in  
that -- s -- you can call that a camp , in the 

military academy™s building that we were, that 
was a camp. To see wh
at Hitler did to our 
people is -- I™ll describ e it in plain. Ther
e wasn™t a night passing 
by without in the middle 
of the night that it would start almost like a 
regular riot. Kapo, you 
heard an outcry kapo, 
meaning, a kapo is the German name for the 
leader of a group. And these leaders were 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
40
 
 
 
 
the ones who were smiten -- smiting th e Jews
, and punishing the Jews. The Hitlerites 
always got a double pleasure, to see when a 
Jew hits another Jew, you know? And in th e 
meanwhile, those people who recognize it, we
 had to call in the MP™s, and it was a 
terrible, terrible situation to keep. That™s wh
y we realized we gotta break the camp away 
from it, but the entire camp feeling, which you
 ask me, I did not know this. And to say 
that in Israel it was a feeling against them
, no. If it was a feeling against them, it was 
among people -- in other words, between camp  
leaderships and so on. Wh at per -- say to 
generalize that, I couldn™t -- I woul
dn™t agree on th at part at all.  
Q: It was -- I -- I had heard something a
bout how maybe there was some discrimination 
be -- be -- on the part of -- of some of the pe
ople who were interested
 in building the state 
of Israel because they were looking fo r pe
ople who were strong, 
and who would fight, 
and there was some discrimination because 
it was assumed that people who were in 
camps didn™t resist enough. And I was wonde
ring wh ether you saw any of that kind of 
discrimination. So  you didn™t see any 
-- you™re saying you didn™t see anything. 
Q: I -- I didn™t see it, b u t it™s -- remains a si
tuation of division fo
r always and forever, 
basically. There is more told what it went on 
in the camps. All the 
horror stories are more 
knowledgeable, be in film, be in script, and so
 on. The resistance story is still a novice, in 
my book. I read quite a few b
ooks, but the real stories, a
nd the more the merrier, because 
it needs to be told more no-now. Israel, per se
, did not have anything but open arms that 
they extended to us at that particular time.
 And we mu st confess, those people who were 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
41
 
 
 
 
in the camps, those people who were in the 
partisans, they were the front lines, who 
immediately joined from those ille
gal ships, when the war broke
 out in Israel, be that it 
was not fully recognizab le, but in
 1948, when Israel got status 
as a state of Israel, at that 
particular time, you saw yesterday™s camp  in mates, yesterday™s people who came from 
hiding, or they were fighting in
 the partisans. As I me -- 
forementioned before, there was 
a bipartisan way, and it was no discrimi
nation going on here. Yes, there was a 
discrimination at the time that it happened in  Isr
ael, bipartisan, with that ship that it blew 
up in ammunition, and so on. An
d I™m sure you™ve he
ard about it, but that is not my time, 
or my story here to talk about it, that is al
ready record ed . Bu t Esterburg say, you resisted, 
or didn™t resisted, was sort of a question mark
 in a school level, or otherwise, and that 
goes on til this day. When I come to Israel, 
I was there only about a year and a half ago, 
and the same thing so many years afterwards, when I wa -- came in
to the kibbutz wh at 
the partisans have over there, and I could find 
a lot of the -- m-my name is in there, and a 
matter of fact, I™m sending them, I didn™t finish, a -- a biography in short -- my biography 

in short, it will be about 10 pa
ges, so they could record it, 
but I couldn™t s -- s -- find any 
animosity, or any criticism. It™s
 just minds that have -- want
 to know, to fill in the void 
about how we resisted. Not -- a
nd the other thing, that it wa
s resistance. And I still must 
tell you, I know year after year, when I go 
to the awareness days, when I come here, I 
was there last month, and I™m going to  go again 
this year in March again. When I talk to 
these here high school kids, be -- yo-you find 
-- last time in -- it wa
s the biggest, curious 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
42
 
 
 
 
thing happened to me is I had a Israeli -- th
e parents were Israeli, the kid was born in 
Israel, but he was over here with -- because 
they moved here. He kn
ew nothing about the 
Holo caust whatsoev er. To him was just a novice 
thing that he just heard it, and especially 
my telling him that I was in the partisans. I 
had 10 students around my
 table, and I think 
it was the most active table in many tables 
around, not that the other ones didn™t. But 
somehow or other, it was a curious thing to  
those who understand. And after all, I™m 
dealing with kids let™s say 15 - 
16 years of age, and they  know 
what it is, resistant to -- in 
the word , to understand. Bu t they had a gene
ral view, story is not known . Bu t as soon you 
open up your mind, the questi
on always comes up, why weren™t th ere mo re? Not that I 
wanted more. There was in every country of Eu
rope, let™s for the fact, be Martial Tito in 
Yugoslavia, be the French Re
sistance in -- in France. No 
matter which country  you want 
to name, where resistance existed, there were Je ws in there. Were th ey in the percentages 

that it should have been , no. Ho wever, the public
 lacks the understanding. First of all, the 

physical make-up of those people in the ghettos,
 if they were longer, were not to be able 
to became fighters and resisters. B u t the Warsaw
 ghetto proved it, that
 they did resist, and 
they did hold for two weeks, 
much more than the armies 
in Poland held
 the Germans 
from entering Poland. So, 
there was resi stanc e in other gh
ettos besides Warsaw, too. But 
to resist in the way that we jo
ined the resistance of the partisans, of the Soviet partisans, 
or wh erever, in the other countries. That 
is an understanding th at we lacked the 
organization, we lacked  the willingness of the 
people involved in  it to say come and join

us. Because it took me a hard time, almost 
three weeks to find them, and after I found 
them, my  group of fo ur, we had a hard time 
explaining to the commander that we could 
not. How do we obtain weapons? Yes, we we
nt on the ambush with them, and that™s how 
they got weapons, and that™s
 when it -- and the -- and the majority were good fighters, 
among th e top fighters. And I™m talking about th
e Jewish fighters, not that I™m trying to 
glamorize the situation, but tell the facts 
for posterity™s sake, that people should know 
about it. Because we were a fighter who had 
nothing to lose. The other fighters had a lot 
to lose. They  had families, they didn™t want to
 go to work in Germ
any. So th e Belarus, 
for instance, or those leftover soldiers who di
dn™t want to wind up  in POW camps, they 

were -- they had a lot to lose, because they
 had families and everyt
hing. But any Jew who 
came onto the partisans, or to the resistance, 
remember, his last -- w h atever he had he -- 

blood in him, or whatever he had power to re
sist, he resisted, because it was th e last fight. 
Every day was the last fight of his life that 
he™d been fighting. So it™s understanding th at 
they -- we could be among th e ones to be talk
ed about a lot. And unfortunately, so far, it 
isn™t talked enough. You see how hard I to
ld  you I have to go ahead to have my 
manuscript published. There is 
no takers. Looks like if I was to wrote a novel, which a lot 
of times people told  me -- and maybe they ™ll 
encourage me to do, but how in  a novel -- 
where, in a novel it™s fantasy? You don™t necessa
rily hear the true story about it, but looks 
like people in a -- buying a novel is easier to se
ll, or easier, in other wo
rds, to sell it to the 
-- to the people responsible for publishing, as 
well as the public perhaps reading it. Looks 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
44
 
 
 
 
like people do not want to read
 a lot the horro r stories what it went on. And ag ain, it was 
directly against just a minority, the Jews, 
for not giving th e reason why. So  I suppose 
maybe that has a reason, but for the sake of 
history, and for the futu re generation, this 
story must be told, be inscript -- be -- wh
at we are doing right now, and just tell our 
stories.  
Q: You mentioned your family 
in the United States, and you 
also mentioned that in the 
first interview, that the aunt who was here 
in the US, that you we
re corresponding with -- 
with, was a favorite of yours. 

A: Yes. 

Q: How did you know her? How di -- had sh
e -- when did she co
me to the States? 
A: She came in 1929, at the sa
me time when we -- we move
d over to another city from 
where I was born. And we moved -- the name 
of that city was Australenka, and I still 
with my mother, went to the 
train to say good-bye to her. And sh e was favorite with me 
when I was a child, up to then
. You know, I was only seven y
ears of age in 1929. But the 
point was, to ever she was go out, leave for pi
cnics, whatever it is, 
I was -- I -- like she 
took me like -- she loved me -- not at -- like sh
e loved me, she loved me so mu ch that she 
always was -- the other part about it, from th
e other nieces and nephew wh at they had, 
they were not there, in Pola
nd they were all -- in America, her brothers were already 
before that in America. And so
 she came to America that tim
e. My mother would keep  at 
that time, sort of a promise that I -- we s
hould be in contact. So while my  mo ther was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
45
 
 
 
 
write, she would go ahead to ask 
me to write the address to he
r. So therefore, in my mind, 
it just imbued that I remembered -- I could no
t even pronounce
 good in English in those 
years, the address. But at that address,
 where she was living 
in Chicago was so 
memorized  by me, and my few word
s that I used to write so we
 can keep contact. So yes, 
she remembered me as the child
 when she left Poland. And wh
en I first got in touch with 
her, it was the whole story of our lives, you kn
ow wh at I mean? They had to make papers 
three times, to bring us in, like I was telling 
you. So what was the 
reason? At first she 
thought that I™m still si
ngle, because I couldn™t write in th
e letters through that army that 
I™m telling her that I already am married. So th
ey made out immediately papers for me to 
come. No sooner we got more in
 touch, they found out that 
I™m married. So, at that time 
they made the second papers. 
The third papers they made th -- because our baby -- our 
daughter was already born, so that was the re
ason I had to make three times the papers. 
So -- some -- some of the data, I mean, was mi
sconstrued, but that is -- that is a minor 
situation, we are not going to go into that, 
that was -- so our love re-establish our -- itself, 
immediately. Ho wever, the other three brothers
 that they were here
, they were much -- 
they were much -- they
 were in America probably befo
re I was born. So I therefore 
couldn™t go ahead to remember th em, but the firs
t, in Chicago, for instance, we had the -- 
one of the -- there was original
ly  four, but one of them was 
already dead . So in  Ch icago 
we -- I had two uncles, and my  aunt. In Lo
s Angeles I had a third brother, he was the 
oldest, which again, none of 
them, besides my  aunt, rememb er
ed me as a child in Poland. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
And after all they -- I started working late
r for my uncle, and th
at was my  mo th er™s 
brother, he was in the grocery business. And,
 as I forementioned w
ith going to school, 
that was the store I was work
ing for, for him. So I know ho
w much further in the story 
that I told, I do -- over there.
 I joined again immediately an organization, we called them 
the new citizens. So, in Chicago, we dw
e -- used to have meetings, and like I 
aforementioned, and make
 money f-for existence, and above a
ll, to help Israel, be that it 
was already -- when the bonds came in existen
ce to be -- the bond drives. Be otherwise -- 
ambulances to send to Israel, or any of thes
e -- it was basically -- all what we did was 
raising money, and funds through all means, 
be that it was a dance, be that it was a 
dinner, be it was membership, but it all was -- 
the idea about it Israel. And all of us were 
a bunch to gether, but again, the story prev
ailed with me, there were not that many 
fighters, there was all concentration inmates.
 And we did not have any misunderstanding 

because and how and what
. And sooner or later we found 
out, you know what I mean, the 
way it was. I remember when Israel™s sen 
-- fifth anniversary ca
me, and we had a guy 
from the embassy coming to speak to us, and 
I was on th e committee, I always belonged 

someplace, and I always didn™t 
just remain not to belong, 
or be on the committee or 
whatever it is, because I cared 
for it so much. So that man wa
s a former army colonel, I 
believe, or so, and he was in the embassy attach ed. So he comes in, and he says to me, he 

says, ﬁExplain me a little bit about your 
group.ﬂ Because he wa
s going to have the 
speech, and he wanted -- he didn™t have the tim
e before to ask the questions. So I tried to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
47
 
 
 
 
tell him we were 95 percent of former survivor
s of the concen tration camp s, or resistance 
like I am. A few that were -- not even five pe
ople that are -- were f -- in the resistance. 
Hiding maybe, yes, but not in the resistance. So
 -- and I tried to tell
 him it™s a make-up of 
various participation. He says, ﬁWhy don™t 
we belong to a party,ﬂ you see, in other 
word s, the party image or curse, maybe I shoul
d say, because it™s a curse. If we wouldn™t 
be so divided, we wo uld have been  a stro
nger nation th rough the 
years. Why don™t you 
belong to  one party? I says, ﬁWhat would that 
help Israel better? We raise money, we do 
all we can to help Israel. And that party, 
I wish you™d stop bein
g so party minded in 
Israel, I believe it™d be an easier life.ﬂ In c
ontrary, he didn™t like my comments, of course, 
because he said, ﬁWhy do you wa
nt to be orphans?ﬂ In other 
words, belonging to a party 
meant not being an orphan in his mind, and 
in  his view. And he came speaking to us, 
which he was not aware enough wh at had we
nt on during the Ho
locaust, because my 
critic to the time and the era was as -- in my 
writings, I -- I must mention it to you, there 
isn™t a year that I don™t write to  the newspaper, at least in a fo
lder about an inch thick, and 
I have all of them of -- of home. And I™m 
a critic of so me of these here things. I will 
always try to defend Israeli causes, and Jewi
sh causes, of -- of the -- of course, you know 
what I mean, like I said, I didn
™t want to give up Judaism in spite of Hitler, and I believe 
that whenever I think ab
out it, I™m -- I™m more 
for than I was before 
ba -- myself, even if 
I™m not in Israel. But I visited Israel a 
number of occasions. I received a medal like 
holmo r of the partisans who were there, when  
we came to Israel in
 1983, then we had a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
gathering of all the fig h ters. And I have over 
here at har -- at home -- it™s too bad that we 
cannot take another picture. I was honored as a 
partisan over here, too, in -- in -- in Fort 
Lauderdale, a number of years ago. So , I been  a constant participant in all of Jewish 
causes, no matter what it is. I will always belong somewheres, and I will always speak 
my mind whenever I can, and wh
enever I™ve reached out. So lik
e I say, it was born at that 
particular time, even when I came to the United States, and we
 formed the organization. I 
was in the starter, but it already was in exis
tence. We called it the New Citizen™s Club, as 
I aforementioned. We used to have once a 
month a meeting, and so on and so  far. So, 
then it came out the story, wh ich I don™t kn
ow wh ether I mentione
d inforn, where the 
Nazis wanted to march in Skokie. 
Q: That™s -- that™s a little fa
rther in  the future, so let™s stay
 back a little bit. I wanted to 
ask. 
A: Okay, so I™ll wait for your questions. 

Q: I wanted to ask about the -- your jour
ney to the Un ited Stat
es, and about what you 
expected to find wh en you arrived. 

A: Well, my journey in the united -- to the Un
ited States, was basically at the time, that I 
had family, and I thought that th
ey would be of help for me 
to get organized, and settled. 
And I believe it™s a little personal about it, a
nd I do not want to be -- feel that it™s a 
personal way. I didn™t get the help I expect ed to help, although th e family each other -- 

helped each other when  they 
came, so with me, when they
 spend the money, and other 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
49
 
 
 
 
money came from my wife™s fami
ly that she had in New Yo
rk. I believed that when I 
wanted to get establish ed to 
go in busin ess, which I did, I came to ™48, and in 1953 in  
January, I went to business to open up a groc
ery store. And I mu st thank the Almighty, 
who let my wife™s fath er -- my father-in-law 
survive, and he was w
ith us in the forest, 
too. And if he wouldn™t lend me that time 
the money, I would not be in business, you 
know? So while I came to
 the family for help, I didn™t ge
t the help I wanted to get. Not 
that I need -- I wanted the he
lp to give out -- ev
en to loan me the money, I wasn™t -- 
because you must remember, I 
had no collateral. I had no
 -- no way in the world to 
establish credit, and I wanted to
 go in business. One of my 
uncles, may he rest in peace, 
says, ﬁSince you got off the boat, you wanted 
to go in business.ﬂ I said, ﬁI thought it™s a 
capitalistic system in th
e United States, that to go to bus
in ess is okay.ﬂ But like I say, I do 
not wish at this time in my r
ecording to leave the animosity ab
out that, but I seek to come 
here because of them. The tu
rnout was that I wo
uld have been help
ed with the Joint 
Distribution Committee much more if I would 
not have been there. The mere fact of 
going to  school, if I would have been getti
ng help from the Joint 
Distribution Committee, 
I probably  would have been able
 to maintain to go 
to college. This way I did not have an y 
insurance, and my  son was supposed to be
 born, beforehand to
 have some mo ney, 
because I did not have insura
nce for the pregnancy insuranc
e, I had to acquire another 
job. While I was working at my uncle™s store, 
fi -- six days a week, I had to get a job to 
work in a tavern, which it was 
-- he was in partnership with -- with his other part of the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
50
 
 
 
 
family. So I used to work th
ere Thursd ay night, or rather, some weeks Thursday  night, 
Friday night, Saturday 
night, because all those days I worked in a store. And Su nday  I 
used to come, after closing the store 12 o™cloc
k, I used to go home, 
rest up, get something 
to eat. At fi -- at six o™clock I would be back
 to work to work til 12. And this is how I 
accumulated the extra money that I needed for my son to be
 born in that hospital. I 
wanted here to give a plug to a person who 
really -- talking about 
the family. My family 
went to their gynecologist at that particular
 time, and asked him to take charge of my  
wife. And then they asked them
, ﬁWhy do you ask me to gi
ve them a break? You™re the 
family, I™m -- I™m a doctor. I took care of all 
of you.ﬂ And he was very feeling low, in 
other words, for them asking, 
however -- may he rest in pea
ce, he™s no longer around, he 
said he™ll do the wo rk free of charge. And he
 was a renowned gynecologist in Chicago, 
on Michigan  Av enue, which the 
price was pretty high. Bu t as a gesture of his own, he 
went and did -- because my wife
 had to have Caesarian secti
on, she had a letter with it -- 
with her from the fir -- from 
my  daughter was born, she had by Caesarian section, she 
couldn™t have it any other way. 
So  he gave -- he only told 
us, you cannot go through the 
clinic, you mu st go thro ugh the regular chan nels
, because through the 
clinic they may not 
have me doing the surgery, a
nd I wanted him to do th e surger
y at that particular time. 
And when I -- after my son was born, when I came
 to the office with my wife for a visit, I 
brought a -- a -- a bunch of roses, at that time 
he yelled at me. ﬁI thought you can™t afford 
it, and that™s why I  help ed 
you. Why did you have
 to sp end th e mo ney on the flowers?ﬂ 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
So he was really a righteous type of a pe
rson, which I always 
remember, and I -- and 
Blumenfeld, I-I think was his name, and -- it 
is name. And he was not Jewish, he was a 
Gentile. So in other words, I like always, fo
r posterity™s sake, to remember th at there 
were always some people in cl -- even if they
 were not Jews, they were Gentiles, but they 
were generous. That™s why 
we have in Israel, the Ri
ghteous Gentile™s walk. And 
when ever I™m in Yad Vashem, I go th rough th
at, to read names and so on. At a time 
when I was honored here, there was a Righteous Gentile, was honored to the same time, a 
woman who saved seven Jews. Of
 course, instead of the whole eyes of the audience 
would go to my case, as be
ing a platoon commander on the pa
rtisans, she was deservedly 
so, which I understand, after all, sh e saved se
ven Jews, being a Gentile, and she got, sort 
of the place, much more than
 me. And so like I say, so 
many things that happened 
through that era, afterwards, even  though 
to some people, it™s a novice story, because 
they didn™t hear enough of 
the resistance. But when ever it gets ex-exposed , I can tell -- 
say that much with a full mouth,
 th at people understand it, a
nd they™re eager to hear about 
it more and more. So I can only hope and pr
ay someday that my  manuscript should be 
published, and people should be
 able to read it in a more de
tailed way, the way all of that 
horro r went through, and how vi
ctory came, that I survived. 
Q: I wanted to find out about your journey to
 the United States. It was by ship, I assume. 
A :  B y  sh ip , y eah . 

Q: And do you remember anything
 about the journey, the name 
of the ship, your arrival -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, yes, I™ll tell you the whole thing. You want me on? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay, it was a little problem 
since usually, when we applie
d to come, and we had the 
visa already to go to the Un
ited States, the Joint, at that
 particular time wanted to 
intervene to help so me of the people, and I 
thought I™ll go through them, too, while their -
- my relativ es needed help in
 one way or the other. An yways,
 they wanted to give me 
passage, and wh ere did they find the passage? 
On a Soviet ship. And I refused take him -- 
to go with a Soviet ship, beca
use basically, as I aforementione
d, I didn™t trust the Soviets, 
even they should
 have been on a journey taking me 
to y -- to the United States. So I 
refused to go passage. And you know, visas 
have a certain expiration times, I couldn™t 
play around with much. The pa
ssage available until my expiration of the visa was so -- 
was very little choices to be made, besides that
 Russian ship. So I wa
s told by them that 
the only way for me to go would be best to meet
 the visa time that I 
have to go by air, to 
fly to the Un ited States. And I did not -- I wa
s not at that particular time ready with 
flying. Therefore, we had to -- I had -- I ha
d to -- I could get passage on the Vulcania, 
which it was going to meet th
e date. However, the Vulcania 
had only openin
g on second 
class, as you know, they  have always grades of
 classes. It was normally with third class, 
but they  had second class only open passage for 
us to go, everything 
else was booked up. 
So I had to go to  the family, both time [indeci
pherable] my wife fam
ily, and my family to 
-- about th e passage. And su re enough, they
 wired the money, so we could get the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
passage to go on that ship, on
 the Vulcania. The Vu lcania wa
s a luxury vessel, there is no 
question about it, and especially riding on se
cond class was another thing that I did not 
know how to take it, because w
ith all the misery of life that 
we went through -- in Italy it 
was better, but it still was not like living in ap
artment and a -- enjoyi
ng, you know what I 
mean they -- everything a human beings are ma
 -- ine -- are desire --
 not only that they 
want to, but they™re entitled to have. So this
 was coming in like to 
a new world on that 
ship. My -- be -- when we started to sail fro
m Naples, until they hit the Gibraltar, it was 
good sailing, because we were 
told, you know, the first thin
g you get on the ship, you get 
sick and all of that, and we went out even  th
at night, and then [indecipherable] near the 
Gibraltar, I went outside the 
deck and even bough
t some -- some liqueur, you know what 
I mean, because for a dollar you could buy anice bottle of liqueur to bring it to the 
United States, I figured for gifts or so on.
 And no sooner the next mo rning when  we 
started sailing, my  wife t
ook sick. She couldn™t take this
. When  we had to cross the 
storm, to -- they -- when it was 
crossing, at that particular tim
e , I al most was si ck. But my 
daughter, being 22 months old, like I say, a 
little child, they usually
 can withstand it and 
they don™t get sick. And each time, she w
ould speak -- my daughter -- Yiddish at the 
time, or Italian, because kids learn fast la
nguages. And each time 
she would say, ﬁThe 
boat, the boat is,ﬂ you know wh at I mean, tu
rning? Because from the storm, you used be 
thrown away, and be the time. And I had to 
-- not was -- I could do to my wife, because 
she was confined and the nurse was giving 
her injections, whatever it is. And my little 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
54
 
 
 
 
girl just kept me busy, because we going w
ith the stairs, up and down. A child is a child. 
She didn™t care it™s a storm. A
nd each time I had to keep her 
that sh -- because when the 
ship -- that she shouldn™t get 
hit or hurt. And it was -- we we
re delayed because of that 
storm, whole day that we came in later. We we
re supposed to come 
in -- in on a Friday, 
we came in on Saturday, which it was late, an
d we didn™t disemb ark on a Sunday. On ly 
when we saw harbor, that™s wh
en my wife came to, and she wa
s back to herself, so she at 
least -- otherwise she -- you 
know, she wasn™t sick, per se,  
with any special sicknesses, 
but she was seasick. So once we looking at the 
lights, and see the harbor, it sort of was, 
now we looking at the new wo rld, we are ab
out to come and start our new life that we 
promised ourselves to be. So it -- we didn™t
 mind it once she got well, and we had a big 
group of people coming to wit -- to meet us at 
the border -- at -- I mean
 there, at the -- to 
see us from the boat, it was a lot of her family
, that she had more than mine. There were 
cousins, like one cousin was my father™s co
usin, which I knew the family quite well, and 
they were also. And then from there we were 
taken to a house, oh she™s already deceased 
by now, which it was a first cousin of my wi
fe. And they had a little child at home, too. 
And after a few days, that cousin of my  fath
er, Louie was his name, he came, took us to 
his place, because he had a home, and there was more room in his home for us to be 
taken. And of course, I mu st say at that time,
 charity began with th
e family right there. 
That mo rning, you know, he 
took me shopping, his wife took my  wife shopping, bought 
us clothing, you know what I mean, because 
we came -- we made -- I made tailor made 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
55
 
 
 
 
suits over there from the money my  parents -- 
my relatives used to send me packages, 
and with the packages us
ed to be chocolate, and it used to
 be cigarettes. So they helped 
me of all kinds of troubles. When my  wife ha
d to have the Caesarian section there, which 
I™d rather leave a whole part of the story, but
 I™ll only inject over here, the cigarettes, and 
the chocolates -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
A: -- and I would go to the marketplace a
nd buy a chicken, and ch icken soup was the 
good remedy th at we always know about. So
 I would cook, even. But all of that was 
because of the cigarettes, and th
e nuns would be very
 friendly. They gave me a cot that I 
could sleep at night. Because after surgery, for 24 hours, they were
 primitive in those -- 
™48, in Italy -- I mean, my daughter was born in ™46. When I came in ™48 to the United 

States, and my  son had to be bo
rn in ™49, I was like a fantasy.
 It -- to what it take, a whole 
month fo r her to get well, within two -- three days, she was on her feet. And th at™s how 
much advanced the American
 medical system was versus what it was in Italy. 
Q: Were there any other -- was it just yo
u and your wife, and your daughter that came 
together on the ship, or did you 
come with anyone else you knew? 
A: No, we came with other friends that we
 met on the boat, but they -- their lives -- 
survival was in the Soviet Un
ion. They  escaped to the Soviet Un ion wh en fo ur -- 1941 
when the Germans attack
ed, again. So they were living in
 -- in Iasia. And, I mean, they 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
56
 
 
 
 
were suffering, but it was normal war suffering, 
shortages of this, ashu -- but the threat of 
life did not exist with them. We met them, an d 
as a matter of fact, they remained friends 
with -- he is gone already, by 
now, but with his wife, even up to  this day that we made 
friends then, and we still remain friendly, an
d we had sort of a club together, and the 
organization together, and so on. 

Q: They ended up in  Ch icago as well? 

A: Sure. They came to Chicago like we did, 
so we had a lot in common for starters, you 
see? They also came to  family in
 Chicago. We went to high 
school to-together in Austin 
High. They were living in Aus
tin, though, while I wa
s living in Chicago, which it made a 
difference, that™s why my traveling was more. 
But we graduate school at the same time, 
and he s -- he still has a brothe
r alive that they -- we™ve bi
 -- was -- with school -- in 
school with me at the same time.  

Q: What were their names, the -- 

A: Sofferstein is their name
. Th-The both -- two brothers
, and I -- and th e other --they 
both were married, you know what I mean, and ha
ve ch ildren, and we got to know them 
then, and we still, like I say, maintain
 to be f -- to be friendly together. 
Q: What were your first impressions of th
e United States? When you arrived in New 
York, what were -- what did you -- what
 were your impressions of New York ? 

A: To say the least, I would say, I really sa
w a world that I haven™t witnessed before. No t 
because of the atrocities, but it 
was so much difference in livin
g, to know that you have a

toilet in the same apartment,
 which -- who would dream about it otherwise than in a 
hotel. In Poland, you know, befo re the wa
r, to see something like that, running water, 
where in 1939, when the war br
oke out, we still had to ment -- to bring our water in in a 
bucket, from going to -- you know, to a well, or
 whatever it is outside. So it was just like 
an oasis in the desert would be the easiest de
scription for me to make the comp arison, or 
the analogy at the 
time, that it was. 
Q: How were your sp
irits at that time? 
A: My spirits were very uplifted. I really fe
lt at that time that I 
survived. Until then, we 
did not talk each other,
 oh we survived, or this, that, 
and the other. And 
because people 
were asking, but it™s a cute story that it ha
ppened in New York  with
 whole family, with 
my wife™s -- it was an aunt, her mother™s siste
r, that we were invited for dinner there. And 
of course, everybody was eager 
to hear how we su
rviv ed, and wh at had went on. I kept 
talking and telling the people til about thr
ee in the morning, and afterwards I was 
angered. I was angered because the questions, af
ter I told them all, 
two guys says over 
there, ﬁSo how did you surviv
e?ﬂ And it™s sort of to say, ﬁI just told you how we 
survived. We escaped.ﬂ 
But it was so unbelievable to them to listen. It was so remote 
that, in other words, that they
 had to ask me that question, 
so how did we survive. So, like 
I say, I was anger, but I tried to be understa
nding. I says, after al
l, if somebody would 
have told  me about a story like that, by me 
not being th ere, how w
ould I react? I would 
not know how to react 
about a case like that either. I us
ually make the analogy, if people 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
58
 
 
 
 
tell you about Vietnam, or they tell you about 
the My Lai massacre, or anything like that, 
it™s hard to make a judgement for someone who 
hasn™t been there. But if you talk to a 
soldier who has been th ere, and he tells you th at
, I take it for granted that he told me the 
story, because I know how my  story wh en 
I tell people who haven™t witness, or been 
around, it™s very hard  to make them see, or 
believe, above all, believe the story that a b -- 
story was exactly the way it happened. And this
 is why it™s a commonology about it, that 
when you talk to survivors, do not take for granted th
at the next guy you talk with, had 
had the same past as the first one you talk, 
or the third one that you may talk. And it was 
proven in  the documentation sent over, they  to
ok interviews from so 
many surv ivors, that 
hardly  could have been  two or three stories 
that you co uld make, oh it™s the same thing. 
The only same thing was the German, the Nazis,
 the beating, you know, perhaps, and so 
on. But the way it came all about was totally 
difference and -- and by 
now a lot of people 
are aware, more than 
they were let™s say 1948, wh en we
 came to the United States. But it 
was a total, total strange story. Some of them
 told us that [indeciph
erable] in the papers, 
they didn™t know anything about it, which la
ter on, wh en I began to
 find other findings, I 
was a tremendous critic about it,
 because there is no way in 
the world that a ship, the 
Saint Louis, who came and wanted  to dock  in
 Florid a, right here, that it could have 
happened. I believe for -- in posterity, a hundr
ed years, 200 years from today, when  the 
kids™ll read it in history, it will not come to
 them. They will say, 
something is not told 
accurately that it could have be
en that a ship with
 a hundred people. 
We know more from 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
59
 
 
 
 
history now that Hitler tried to prove it, that 
the Jews are not want 
-- and here America let 
them plu -- prove it. That™s why, when we ta
lk about books that ha
ve been published, 
ﬁThe Secret War Against the Jews,ﬂ for in
stance, by Jo hn Loftus, for one, or others, 
people know more about it today.
 But at the time, in the era,
 and it -- when  that happened, 
the event, it™s hard for me, ev
en a survivor, to understand 
how that could have happened 
without demonstrations. How it could have ha
ppened  without better
 judgement than the 
American people and the American governmen
t had made not to let in that ship. 
Q: But people were asking you about yo
ur experiences, and were interested? 
A: Yes, people are very interested after th
ey ask. But some people are afraid to ask 
because they feel like they ar
e hurting us, the survivors, by
 revealing the past, what had 
happened. For instan
ce, I want to inject one more time, 
even if I do it to the other tape. 
Til this day, we never sat down with our ki
ds, or grandchildren, and tell them. I gave 
them my manuscript to read. In 
fact, they didn™t read it. No
t why they didn™t read it. I 
believe they can put themselves 
together to face us, and say, ﬁLook what our parents, or 
grandparents went through.ﬂ I™m understanding to the fact. So, wh en we sit down about a 
certain thing, or when I write to the pape
rs, and they read it --  I have one of my 
granddaughters that w -- just got married 
a-about a few weeks ago. And I was writing 
poems, and I have one poem, Dermarterology, wh en I wrote Dermarterology, and I asked 
in it the question, sort of why did the world ha
ve to have a Holocaust? Did-Didn™t the 10 
command-mandments that we gave to the wo rld, didn™t all the other things, with so many 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
60
 
 
 
 
Nobel prize winning, and ev erything, satisfy 
the world for the good 
we brought to them? 
Why did it have to have the 
Holo caust? And she was always
 eager to read if a -- an 
article, and I wanted basically to let her re
ad, mu ch better than tell my  daughter. I don™t 
know why I felt that w ay, but that what it wa
s. And she said to me
 more than once about 
my poems -- because my poems are interjected 
how I escaped to the forests, some of my 

poe -- I ask in one of my poe -- poems, I as
k to God, ﬁW hy don™t you grant me some 
wings, so I could fly from tree to tree, until 
I will come to freedom?ﬂ I mean, th e whole 
poem deals with it. And the other one that I 
have, I -- a dream, like I dreamed that I will 
be able to escape from all the 
-- th e -- the bad things that 
it™s going on in the ghetto, and 
so on. So I™m saying in me, it™s imbedded, th
e whole life. And my gr
anddaughter said to 
me at the time, me -- as a ch -- sh e mu
st have been a child, probably , that I 

[indecipherable] about it, mu st have been eight 
or nine years of age. And she said, ﬁPapa, 
how come all your poems, or you
r writing is so sad?ﬂ I says, ﬁMarissa, I lived a sad life. I 
cannot go out to put in
 -- in it happy occasions. So wh en
 I write about that I,ﬂ you know, 
like I told her  the other poem, when I desc
ribed in it I wish God would give me those 
wings so I could fly, and then I come to the 
end. ﬁOh God, you didn™t grant me the wings, 
and I will be sitting and cry for always and 
forever,ﬂ you know what I mean, about it. I 
don™t say I will die. That I don™t bring out. Somehow or other, in all my punishment, I did 

not use word ings of dying or thinking -- I al
ways was thinking of life. And maybe that 
was what I needed to su
rvive, is the positive part, to figh
t if it™s necessary, whatever it is.

So, all in all to say I was involved with a
ll of these here things, on every occasion 
daneech, even though, at the timewhen  I raised little children -- 
I took, in 1953, as I -- I 
don™t know, I believe I forementioned it, the audacity to go to 
write a manuscript in 
English. I felt so goo -- sure, I knew how to
 write, but I did not 
know literally how to 
write, but to me, I didn™t care what™s it™s mi
ssing, you know, because
 I always left it to 
that literary  agent, which I paid for, a
nd didn™t do nothing fo
r me, and who knows 
whether he™s still alive, or to the other one
. But I wanted the story. I would not -- if I 
would have be locked  in in a room today, lik
e we are right now, and say, ﬁHarold, tell me 
the story, it wa -- in your manuscript,ﬂ I probab
ly would not be able 
to tell it in the way it 
happened . I probably  would not 
be able to tell -- remember a
ll th e names, dates for sure 
not, you know what I™m saying. Well, but, fo
r these things, there is such thing as 
documents, you can always add in things. So  th
at™s what it was, my 
part. I only wanted to 
put up as good of my  memo ry
 as I remembered what I we
nt through. It was a p arty 
before they broke out in Pola
nd, which I me ntion over there. So it™s no use me revealing. 
I live with all of this here history. When I 
speak to people, for instance, I must say it over 
here, which I couldn™t say it there, I™m b
ilingual in eight languages, and I speak them 
fluently. And when I sp
eak to people, and I™ll start turn
ing from Span ish into  Hebrew, or 
into Russian, or into Po
lish, and that™s in me -- in busine
ss it helped me a lot, especially 
in Chicago. There™s a lot of 
bilingual usage that you co uld -- being here in Florida, the 
same thing, we get people from all ur -- of
 Europe, and when I can turn around in a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
minute -- but I mu st confess here, I reserve my self in not speaking a language which it 
happened a few times. Wh
en I started to speak German to
 a German fellow, and all of a 
sudden he removed his shirt, and he wants to
 try on a shirt. I was working in Galleria 
Mall at that particular time, for the -- name
 of the store was The Forum. And I took a 
look [indecipherable], here I saw underneath his 
arm -- the SS used to 
have th is here, that 
was their code, where it was r -- p u t over ther
e, underneath there -- or the Gestapo, who 
knows where he could have bi -- when  I saw th
at, I -- I turned colors, I c -- I w as -- I was 
-- asked that I want to go to  the washroom, ju
st to go away from the man, if not to lose 
myself. So when I -- like we were in Israel a 
year and a half ago, and we [indecipherable] 
over there, in that hotel, they
 were maybe 40 percent of Ge
rmans, young, of the ages of 
my  kids, and with th eir children, I did not feel
 restricted of myself
 to speak German to 
these people. And -- but all in a
ll, I -- I meet people because 
I am so involved with it, so 
to one I can speak Po lish, while in -- two se
conds later, I™ll switch over to Russian, or 
from Russian to Sp anish, or to Hebrew, and people always have -- how could I reme mb er 
all of that at one time? And this is -- 
was my  own idea, I don™t know how good my  
memory will serve as I age, yo
u know what I™m saying? So, it was always importance to 
me to bring out in me. I believe someday so
me student will probably want to make this 
here a lesson, and to talk about
 to other children, which is of
 importance. And I hope that 
they always get -- that they always can re
me mb er when you have 
a bad times, don™t look 
for the half empty glass, look fo r the half full 
glass. Hope should never be lost. We™ll die 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
anyways, we all know that. We cannot preser
ve that. But hoping to die, you will die 
sooner. Hoping to live, you w
ill live longer. And it™s not just 
a phraseology of words, it™s 
a thing that it™s -- really work
s. And you talk to prisoners of
 war -- we did -- we talked to 
a man like Mr. McCain, who was in prison w
ith the Vietnamese, o r you talk anybody 
who was in prison, and they surv ived. They 
will tell you in  the same word s that I am 
saying, they  couldn™t overcome their ordeal, be 
in Iran, be in Vietnam, be in Korea, be 
ever -- anyplace that a prisoner of war was ta
ken, if hope would 
not be lost. Because 
when hope is lost, that™s what it happens, it™s 
lost, life is lost. So, my message is always 
of importance. When I talk abou
t the better deal, not to forget
 to have that listener hear 
that hope to live. So when 
I speak to young kids, high sc
hool kids and student -- or 
students, or even in co lleges which I spoke,
 I always do not give
 answer. The hardest 
thing was for me when I spoke to kids in sc
hool of years back -- which I have some on 
tape also, and they ask me how many Germ
ans did I kill? And ho
w do you go ahead to 
answer a child in school when
 he ask me a raw question like 
that? And it™s a hard way to  
answer. I must therefore, instead of giving him an answer to say, ﬁOh, I killed probably 
20, or 30, or 50,ﬂ wh ich it would mean I woul
d go ahead to look at a personal thing, 
remember the questioner, remember
 that he is the child of 14 
and 15, and I do not want to 
give him that answer, that life -- answer is
 the weapon, and killing 
is the answer. So I 
always must bring it to him the idea, that yes,
 killing is not right, but defending oneself is 
the right that he mu st never forg et, no matte
r who it is, when your lif
e is threatened, you 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
64
 
 
 
 
also have the law of rights for you to go ah ea
d and defend your life. So wh en I tell that to 
the kids, they get a bi -- they get a differe
nt understanding about weap ons, and about 
killing. And this is usually, when I spoke to
 kids today, it would not matter where. I 
spoke seven years in a row that 
I used to be here in Fort La
uderdale, and I used to make 
the Day of Remembrance -- Reme
mbrance Days, in city hall.
 And I remember the first 
mayor that time, that adopted for me to
 do it was Mayor Kamins
ki. And the biggest 
question always used to  be, why did I want to 
chose that I want to speak in city hall? And 
after I explained it to him, they saw my  way 
is right. I say, you must remember that all 
our sufferings, it started in bu
ildings like that. Whether laws were changed, or the laws 
were taken away. I want to be
 proud of the idea that I surv
ived , and we have seen a time 
where we can come back to these buildings, a
nd salute the freedom we have in  America, 
and the freedom that it should be of demo cracy 
throughout the world, th
at yes, there is a -
- a repayment day to  be proud of, that we ch
anged the evil days, and this is what it was, 
my messag e in the same way when I came to
 speak in  front of the justice depart -- 
justices in Springfield, Illinoi
s, when the Nazis wanted to 
march, so if you™re ever 
interested, go ahead, get the movie, ﬁSkokie,
ﬂ and you™ll see Danny Kaye play  Harold 
Zissman in it. And this is wh
at I said, and I was the last 
speaker, not expected maybe, to 
speak at all, and wh en we get it first at th
e house, with the congressmen, and it was, at 
that place, it was the military commander the 
-- from the Jewish war veterans of the state 
of Illinois. It was the commander of the wa
r veterans -- the Jewish war veterans of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
65
 
 
 
 
Chicago, it was a few congressmen, and every
body was sort of questioning, what subject 
are you going to  talk about, wh at subject is th
e other one going to talk about? Because we 
did not want to use the time, 
in other words, that shu -- tw
o people who should be talking 
it in the same way. When it came
 to me, I says, ﬁI? I had no 
title.ﬂ Just as it is in the 
movie, the true words that he picked up. Wh
o knows, maybe I may not even  be called to 
say anything, but today a surprise. Even  I was 
the last person called, 
when they called my 
name, I came over, and I says, at the time, w h
ich the language is still fresh with me, 
ﬁLadies and gentleme n of the ju
stices, and justice™s guests, 
who are here today, I want 
you all to rise for one mo ment of silence, t
oday is D-Day.ﬂ With the loudest voice I could 
get out. They all rose, and I tuc -- checked 
my  watch. And I says, ﬁNow, you may be 
seated.ﬂ Cameramen started runn
ing from all side to
 me, I became th e hero, I became the 
one. And a guy from a small town in Illinoi
s comes over to me, he says, ﬁMr. Zissman, 
I™d like an interview.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁI™ll be more than happy to
 give you an interview, but not 
today, not now.ﬂ I says, ﬁRabbi Montrose a
nd me are going right 
now back to Skokie, 
because my niece, and the rest of the class of
 the Hebrew school is 
going to be graduating 
today. However, here is my card,ﬂ I was an [i
ndecipherable] salesman at that particular 
time. I says, ﬁYou can call me to my house, 
I will give time to you, and I™ll make the time 
for your convenience. Come and see me and 
I™ll give you all the interview.ﬂ The fact 
remains that he did have a beautiful [indecipher
able] in some place, 
like almost to say my 
archives there. And the man, you know, he 
was not Jewish, he was Gentile, but I moved 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
66
 
 
 
 
him, and that™s why he wanted to  hear me. Al
l the other speakers, while they were talking 
about the march, I didn™t talk
 just about a march [indecipher
able]. I just come with a -- 
that -- the minute of silence, I says, ﬁSo ma
ny years ago, our boys
 and girls went to 
Europe to fight Nazism, so that menace s
hould never be seen nor 
heard.ﬂ The judiciary 
committee at that particular time wanted to pa
ss on a law that freedom of speech yes, but 
to go on the paraphernalia, w
ith the swastikas and everything
 like that, the way the Nazis, 
especially the SS, and Gestapo were dresse
d, that is not nece
ssary to do, because 
whatever we tried at th at time, on the jer 
-- Phil Donohue show, which I forced my way 
through, and I repeat something, probably  you 
heard of it. Talked to Goldberger, I wanted 
to make the separation between freedom of sp
eech, and attack on peopl
e™s life. And that™s 
basically what the march was all 
about. They did not -- if they 
want to speak, they didn™t 
have to come to Skokie, they can speak anyw
ay. But they wanted to
 come to Skokie for 
the reason that survivors of 
the Holocaust were living by 
such multitudes there, and 
throw the venom that we don™t deserve to be 
alive. Now, this is 
a different than free 
speech, this is a threat to life, and I belie
ve the First Amendment never was intended to 
make a threat of life. We used to say that
 hi -- il -- you know, saying fire in a crowded 
theater is against the law. Okay, but this is 
another saying. Now, a threat of a life of a 
person cannot be tolerated, be
 -- who it may be, be against Jews, be against Asians, be 
against Blacks or anybody else. 
It has no place in a society, 
of the 20 -- of the millenium 
that we entering right now to exist. And th
is has always been my  fight about it. And 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
67
 
 
 
 
that™s why I -- I -- we tirelessly, no matter I 
work  hard , I still -- I just stopped work ing for 
a little while right now, because
 my granddaughter™s marriage
, but I may go back to work 
[indecipherable], I™ll see how 
my health will permit me. But 
it never took 
away from me 
the time to sit down behind the 
typewriter and write an article to the paper. A lot of times 
I™m not published, and they try, perhaps to 
discourag e me, but no one, as long I will live, 
and my mind will be silent -- will be in go
od shape, and it™ll be sa
ne, will anybody give 
me any problems that I will not be able to
 speak my mind up against someone. Sure, I 
wrote an article against Haider now in Aust
ria, it was not published, but I spoke up. 
Maybe these words may change th
e editor, okay? So be 
whatever situations that has -- i-it 
happens in the United States, of
 all the years that I™ve been here. I always was vocal, and 
I will remain vocal for as long as I live, to bri ng th e story out. It™s not just to tell about the 
Holocaust, it™s to tell to prev
ent another Ho locaust every to occu r, and it doesn™t have to 
be a Holocaust against the Je
ws, the Holocaust against anybo
dy else. The Holocaust only 
happened because too many minds were silen t. 
What it happens right now with Haider, in 
Austria, which openly -- and we 
will see, with those people wh
o think mine -- that he has 
no place in government. For as long -- because he
 says I™m sorry I said that, it still lives 
in him. For as long people ha
ve in their minds against certa
in people, which I said it in 
my article there -- he was against the immi
gration with co mes in. Who made them be 
immigrants if it wouldn™t be for the Nazis at
 their time, where Aust
ria was a part. So we 
must, and understand always, these situati
ons. There™s so many lies came out in print 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
68
 
 
 
 
because they knew somebody. I™ll never forget, 
I had a fight, and I lost it. I lost the fight. 
About thr -- about three year
s ago, that time when my 
other daughter was married 
[indecipherable] -- my grandda
ughter, the first one, and it wa
s in West Palm Bea ch. And 
in West Palm Beach, we have a lot of these hate
rs in there, be that 
they™re neo-Nazis, Ku 
Klux Klan, you name it. Be fro
m the church, or whatever. They
 are there, they find they 
are th -- and an article was there, written 
by a man who is a novelis
t writer, he is not a 
historian, and he came saying that the Ausc
hwitz [indecipherable] about Germany has got 
to stop. So  he tries to bring out, why not 
look at the good things? And the man came and 
brought out that in Berlin, th
at the Berliners were hidden 
10,000 Jewish families. Now, 
when I saw that -- I was reading the paper [i
ndecipherable] that mo rning, and I was all 
shaken up. 10,000 is a multitude
. If he was to say at least 
a hundred, maybe it would have 
been cor -- not questionable, but it would 
have been believable
. But that multitude, 
10,000? And I wrote a -- an article to the pape
r, and asking them. I says, ﬁDon™t you think 
that Yad Vashem in Israel would have any kn
owledge about that, so 
they would go ahead 
to,ﬂ -- they did fo r single people who saved a 
Jewish family, planted a tree in his name 
and ev erything. I said, ﬁThe Ho lo caust Muse
um in Washington, D.C., don™t you think 
they would have had a record 
of so mething like that?ﬂ But it falls o n  deaf minds. I called 
before that, because I think maybe I didn™t hear 
it, but I know, I am pretty much in tune to 
all of these here things that 
are happening, but my  article of
 rebuttal, never appeared. And 
this is why we mu st have mo re people be outs
poken, be in script, be vocal. An d we mu st 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
69
 
 
 
 
not remain just to ourselves, ﬁOh, you can™
t do anything about it.ﬂ That™s the negative 
attitude, which I said. We must look at it posi
tive. When it™s a time to
 speak out, we must 
speak out. Otherwise, democracy will never be
 a democracy, but that™s the whole idea of 
democracy, that everybody is en
titled to their opinion. So while
 we guard honor to exist, 
we mu st guard of these reactionary forces, th
at they never should take hold ag ain, to 
whatever they have in mind. 
And you know -- we know what
ever they have in mind, one 
against the other, and that™s what they co
me, and become -- you know what I mean. To 
settle -- they kill both 
of them, and that™s all there is to it. 
Q: Let me ask you, y-yo

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an
 interview with Harold 
Zissman. I w anted to st-
stay with the time of your arrival in the Unite
d States a little bit more, and get some more 
details about wh at happened . An d -- and al
so, if you could comment on -- y -- obviously  
you were ver -- you™re very aware of the 
American judicial system, and -- and the 
importance of the laws, and how they affect
 people, and your involvement at Skokie 

speaks to that, too. So maybe 
you could talk about how you 
became a US citizen, and --  
A: Okay, that™s 
-- will be good. 

Q: -- and what that meant to you. 

A: When I came to United States in 1948, I 
believe the first thing on my mind was in the 
positive, how do I become a citiz
en of the United States. I file
d my first papers, as we call 
them, as so on time permitted to be done for 
it, and -- and at -- when I was called was 

almost five years later to be
come a citizen, and I proudly am
 happy that I was granted the 
-- first of all, that I was granted life again,
 because I consider that™s -- I was reb o r -- 
reborn, I, my wife, and my daughter, coming to
 the United States. We -- some p eople of 

ours, the survivors want to come, that we we
re reborn, at freedom time when -- when the 
hostilities ended. But to me, I don™t want to
 call it that it was s
till life. To me, the 
impression that I made, the firs
t class, in the ship
 that I thub -- the same thing, even 
though our apartment, 
the first apartment was in a base
me nt, and we were there with a 
child, and a few months later, my  brother-in-
law came. S o  even though there was a lot of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
71
 
 
 
 
things to be dissatisfied about
, but my satisfaction, like I 
forementioned, be going to  
school, be all of the other things, belonging ag ai
n to an  organization. So I can see that my  
life had started -- I was reborn in  1948 with  
my  wife, and I hope the man above, or the 
person ab ove, that God rememb ers that not to
 account my years be
fore, and that would 
been a great favor that I can ask. The Un ited States as a govern ment, I had a lot of 

dissatisfaction in my mind with the Roosevelt 
era, and at times it was hard on me to go 
ahead to throw it away. I know
 being a history student, an
d being involved with the 
things in Italy, I knew n -- quite well about 
a person from Switzerland who came that he 
was work ing, and telling over here, he -- the 
ordeal of the Jews, what it was on. And it 
was at a time in ™42, when Hitler already 
had made the dimensi
on of the le -- Final 
Solu tion, or Judenrein, but the Final Solutio
n, that was image. I know well enough the 
story wh ere the partisans in Po land, who sent
 all their messages to 
England, and it went 
in a safe world. So like I say, it w as a 
rebirth for me, coming to see freedom. And I 
suppose when a person is frees, th at™s how 
your questions become open, because in other 
word s, when  I was under the Soviet Union, 
I couldn™t ask some of the questions that it 
came up to me in the United States. I couldn™t 
ask why would th
e British at that particular 
time, keep hidden that story th
at -- that it was told, that th
e final solution, by Goebbels 
when he allows -- that they™
ll rid themselves of the Jews 
of all Europe, why would that 
have to be in a safe sill? Perhaps the Je
wish community in  Britain would have maybe 
react to it, I understand, and that™s why they
 kept it from them. But 
in America, under the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
72
 
 
 
 
Roosevelt administration, know
ing full well at that time that a delegate came, and telling 
all of that, and since the Un ited States, at
 that particular time, under the Roosevelt 
presidency  did not see fit to 
give any help whatsoever, to 
stop the menace of destruction 
that it went on in Auschwitz, an
d so on, by ohm -- what that 
means. I know full well at 
that -- this -- this story of the rabbi from Clev
eland, who went at that particular time to 
intervene to the president, and 
what came out of it. He came out with that message, don™t 
rock the boat. All of these here parts of hate
, and what had happened to all of us became 
renewed follen -- during freedom. But above 
all, I wanted to beco me one of th e 
Americans, in spite of all of this. In a wa
y, I thought maybe, speaking as an American 
citizen, it w ould help my grief to speak out a 
little bit better. And therefore, things got, in 
1953, I was -- became a proud citizen, and 
quiet I did not remain. I was vocal, and 
whatever I could write -- even I didn™t care 
that my  writing was not
 as good as that 
American who perh aps was born, and had mo re
 schooling in  English than I did. I was 
proud about the other thing, that I could speak mo re languages than  the averag e 
American. 
Q: Will you list the languages that you sp eak? 

A: Yes. First of all, I must say, as I said
 it in the aforementioned tape, I graduated in 
Poland, a school by the name Yavna, wh ic
h is a Zionist Hebrew school, and it™s a 
trilingual school. We were taught over th
ere Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. So 
immediately, I started with three schools. I 
usually say to people when they ask me, how 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
73
 
 
 
 
does it happen that you speak eight la-languages
, I say invention -- I say, if a p erson™s in 
trouble, he says, he mu st invent something.
 So, the American proverb goes with it, and 
that™s what it was invention, for me. With 
three languages, when  we crossed the border 
on th e Russian side, I had to learn Russian. Af
terwards, after the wa
r, when we came into 
Italy, I did not know Italian, so I learned 
Italian. While being under the German yoke, it 

was not a question learning German because 
I loved th at language, it was a question that 
when  a German spoke to you, and you didn™t
 understand what he wa
s saying, the beating 
was worse. However, even if 
you did do what he wanted, yo
u still got a beating. But you 
had to -- so again, it was necessity, was for 
me to learn another language. So  no matter 
how mu ch I learned German, but I could at l
east speak, and converse
  with someone in 
German. So we have three, and two is five, 
and the sixth one, came to Italy again. You 
come to a country, is strange, beautiful people
, I wish it would have 
been this type of -- 
side of the ocean, I don™t ever
 leave them. They didn™t care 
to say Jew. To them it was 
polacko. Seeing as I was coming from Poland, 
I™m Polish. And when you said to them 
the word  Jew, or Hebraio, they did not even  
know what the meaning of it, especially in a 
country like that, where Mussolini, and fa -- 
fash -- if -- if you call Fascism Fascism, 
started it w ay before Hitler. But the people 
were not drilled on the hatred. If anybody 
hated a Jew, perhaps he hated somebody else
, too, because he was a hater. But I didn™t 

feel it. The hospitality of these people, what 
they had to us, is be
yond reproach. You ask 
an Italian person, you show him with an ad dr
ess here and there, he wouldn™t tell you it™s 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
74
 
 
 
 
there, or down th e street, next block. He™d take you th ere. This, to us, at that particular 
time, case is need, but I 
still tried to learn Italian. So, 
you have -- you have six languages 
by th en. Wh en I started making my  papers, I did not want to come to America, not be 
able to turn my tongue. So, 
as dearly as I was living on ch
arity sort of, but going to a 
private teacher -- to a tutor, I and another 
friend of mine, we went away to take up 
English. So, as you see, one after the other, 
one after the other was means of necessity. 
When I had my store, after the riots that I we
nt into, instead of th
e grocery business, to 
the men™s business, even the riot
s, I must make my point, I 
was totally destroyed, and 20 
years of labor went on with smoke. But I went 
on with life, and I restructured it, I went 
into the men™s clothing. A tailor recom -- 
is being recommended to
 me by a neighbor 
busin essman, a barber, and he™s a good tailor, 
I tested him, he knew what to do. But I 
cannot speak Spanish. 
My wife goes out, and buys me 
a dictionary, I get another little 
book, and all of a sudden, within a few months 
-- so there you make the total of all of it, 
and they  come to eight all together. And I™m
 very proud about it, 
that I can speak to 
people with other languages. It never happened
 to me that if I meet
 someone, and he™s got 
a hard time in the li -- speaking English, but
 I can, through th eir dialect recognize the -- 
one of the languages, and I™m right there 
-- we already friends, within two minutes, 
because the person can talk to me, or ask me
 qu -- the -- so it becames a friendship. So -- 

but writing, like I say, I only write in Englis
h. I did not write to write in any other 
language, not that I couldn™t write in Hebrew
, or anything like that, I write, but it™s still 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
75
 
 
 
 
today -- in today™s world, that™s the language
 of the wo rld. Wh en 
you know English, you 
can go anyplace in the world a
nd be heard of or -- 
or know about. So that was the reason 
that my  languages was not a merit -- ma tter 
of scholastically, they were a matter of 
necessity. And this is exactly why I 
adopted all of these here things. 
Q: Just a little footnote, the first -- the first 
three languages -- I just wanted to  mention, I 
think there -- there was a slight mistake. Wh
en you mentioned the first three lan guage, it 
was Yiddish, Hebrew
, and Polish, right? 
A: Right, three. 

Q: Okay , you had -- you had 
mentioned English, okay. 
A: Russian is four, and German is five, Italia
n  is six, Spanish is 
seven, and English is 
eight, you know. So th ere you go, you -- my  -- 
my figures are accurately [indecipherable] 
Q: And I -- when you became a citizen, or when
 you started to -- to settle into the United 
States -- 

A: ™53, I went in business, and became a c
itizen at the same time
. In 1953, I became a 
citizen, and in January of 1953, I went in
 the grocery business. Thanks God, as I 
forementioned, to my father-in-law, that he
 helped me with the 
mo ney, otherw ise I™d 
never be able to get started. 
Q: Did you come immediately from New York  to Chicago? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
76
 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. Yeah, I was in New 
York  only when  I 
-- when I came about -- it™s immediately 
-- I spent about three w
eeks in New York. And therefore, we
 came in March, in April we 
were here already -- to sh -- in Chic ago, I mean. So that™s what it was. 
Q: And when did you father-in-
law come to the United States? 
A: He came in 1950. He was in Germany, wh
ile we weren™t -- we were, like I told you 
already, there were -- we were -- we didn™t
 touch Germany. My  brother-in-law came at 
the end of 1948, and -- no wait, my  father-i
n-law came probably  in 1949, not 1950, 
please forgive me, 1949 he came.  
Q: Let me ask you something. So meone else 
who we interviewed, who was involved in 
the resistan ce said that -- that
 while they were raising thei
r children in the Chicago area, 
that -- that sometimes they -- 
they -- they knew s -- there we
re some American Jews in 
the neighborhood who wouldn™t
 let their children play with
 the children of Holocaust 
survivors. 
A: Very true, very true. I™ll tell you mine -- 
my story now. And this
 is a documented si-
situation. In 1948 -- ™48 became -- in 1953, 
I started a business on my  own, and between 
1948 and ™53, I worked for my
 uncle, which I said, my mother™s brother -- brothers. Be 
for what it™s worth, that in
 about 1955, I already had sa
ved enough money for a down  
payment of a three flat building that I went in Skokie, and I bought it. One day my  uncle 

comes to visit with me. Next door to us, in 
the other, was only a two flat, not a three flat. 

Over there, they had a boy of 
my  son™s age, which you usually feel good about it, the two 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
77
 
 
 
 
children of the same ag es, th
ey had some -- so their son used to come to our house 
sometimes, my  son would go to  their house, 
and th e two boys us
ed to  be playing 
together. And I did not want to inject that 
[indecipherable] that kid was an adopted, but 
for the sake of it, l-let it be, it would not 
mean any difference. One day wh en my  uncle 
wants to come to visit with us
, to see -- in other words, our 
new apartment, first of all, 
and the building what we bough
t, because I no longer -- I 
-- my -- my employment for 
him stopped in 1953, in December. So he comesin and while we were waiting, next door 
to us, the guy, who used to be called as a 
nickname Red. ﬁHey Red, how you doing?ﬂ My 
uncle says to him, ﬁOh,ﬂ he says, ﬁI came he
re to visit my nephew
, you know the nephew 
I brought from Europe.ﬂ He gave th e moniker 
right away. And so on, so how you doing, 
he talks to him because he knew him that he 
used to be in the cl
othing business, so on. 
Not telling you a story, but a fact of life, 
my  son™s relationship w
ith his son had stopped 
within a few days, and it never woke up again.
 I did not want to aggrav ate a situation like 
that towards my child, you kn
ow what I mean. After all, 
my  son was born in  1949, so 
here we™re talking ab out 1954, so you know, 
he was a little boy of, 
you know, five years 
old, he understands wa -- so, he™s a very -- 
a child cannot understand this here. So be it. 
So in school he met with more
 kids than that, when  he started school, which at five, you 
know what I mean? He didn™t [indecipherable] 
yet. So we didn™t worry about it. It hurted 
us, what happened. So, the only disruption it c
ould have been, that this way he didn™t 
know wh at we Holo caust survi
vors, you know? Because first of
 all, we were work ing too 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
78
 
 
 
 
hard, and my wife used to take the kids to s 
-- to the store to bring them, because at that 
particular time I tried to save as much 
as I could on help, you 
know? And besides, I 
borro wed money. I borrowed money from my  
father-in-law, borrowed money from my 
brother-in-law, and I had to repay them, so 
the only way to repay 
them when you buy a 
small store, is to see that a -- you don™t over
due on expenses, you know? So  that was the 
part, which at that time, that we did. So 
we did not have, basically, enough association 
with the neig hbors around, you
 know? Was -- when we came, 
was late at night, when we 
went away was early in the 
mo rning. The store used to 
be open from -- from about nine 
in the morning, til about six o™clock at nigh
t, so you know, it -- it w ould take, in those 
days, I will driv -- I started to drive a car 194
9, just as my son was born. I fought for 
everything. I wanted to  be, to me to become 
just a regular person, without a moniker, you 
know what I mean? So to say a lot of tim
es, I would get, thro
ugh the years, from 
American people, not just that particular ca
se that I forementione
d, ﬁHey, I detect an 
accent on you, where you 
from?ﬂ I says, ﬁI™m fro
m hell, but I made it back.ﬂ And people 
would say -- one time a customer in the 
store said to me, ﬁY
ou mean from Hell, 
Indiana?ﬂ I says, ﬁNo, I did not know that In
diana has a Hell.ﬂ He says, ﬁOh yeah, there 
is a place n amed Hell, in Indiana.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁMy hell comes much furt
her than that.ﬂ So, 
the cus -- the wife -- the customer says, 
ﬁYou mean, you come from Europe?ﬂ I says, 
ﬁYes, the Holocaust is what I 
forementioned.ﬂ So wh at I™m saying, I always tried to keep  
this away. Even as of late, 
when I worked at Bloomingda
le™s in Boca Raton, people 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
79
 
 
 
 
would co me into me, other ones would say, ﬁHey, I just heard you speak another 
language, you sp oke Sp anish. Where are 
you coming from?ﬂ And I would say th e same 
thing, from hell. ﬁSo wh at happened y
ou acquired all these languages?ﬂ I says, 
ﬁNecessity.ﬂ Just like the proverb says, is th
e mo ther of inventio
n. Necessity is the 
mother of invention. That was with me the ca
se. But people always sort of have a habit 
that very few inst -- not all -- not all of th
em, not there, some people take it in a wrong 
kind of a way. You know how 
to saying goes, if -- if you ar
e ever bitten by a dog, keep a 
stick handy. You know what I am
 saying? Because not to be b
itten again. And this is -- in 
mo st cases, it™s a touchy way wh en you touc
h it. You know, it™s like electricity, you get 
that shock. You get an electri
c shock with the way some peop
le -- oh I know -- I heard all 
about it. You know wh at I™m saying? If you he
ard all about it, you wo
uldn™t have to ask 
me, obviously, but you do ask me, so it™s still mi
sunderstood, the whole era, even we are 
talking about 55 years later. And 
some people, if I has to voca
lize on it, will say, if there 
are Jews, o r non-Jews, wouldn™t matter with
 me. The guilt of the citizens, who were 
complacent at the era, and who were not 
mixed up in the politic
s -- which American 
people are not mixed up in  politics. I don™t know
, I could say thanks God, no, and I s -- 
could say the other way around, there™s always 
two sides to each story, because we see it 
by the record of ame -- percentages of American
 people who go to -- to vote. I woke -- by 
the way, I worked for a polling place, and 
I go do it for quite a few years. The 

percentages comp aring Europe and the Un ited 
States, who go to the polls to vote, is 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
80
 
 
 
 
ridiculous. So that is the sa
me thing what I say, American
 people basically, until election 
time don™t count -- don™t talk ab out the politics so much as pe
ople of other countries. So 
like I say, there is perhaps a plus, and a mi
nus in it. Who knows how the outcome would 
have been different? But the gui
lt is a guilt in existence. No
body -- when so
mebody just 
as recently started to mention for the mille
nium, talking about pr
esidents. And I don™t 
care what category they™re going to
 put in Roosevelt, he had made at that particular time, 
Social Security, and anything 
like that, yes, there were 
good th ings. But we have a 
proverb in  Hebrew th at we say, ﬁWherever th
ere is light, there is always a shadow.ﬂ And 
we know it when  we speak scholastically from 
school. When you put in
 that little stick in 
the ground, at 12 o™clock the shadow is the sm
allest, but there is a 
shadow. So you always 
mu st understand it, to be understanding to  pe
ople. There is always going to be that 
shadow, there™s always going to be some 
people who do not, or di
d not know well, or 
don™t understand the situation well, to opi
nionize certain ways. However, I would not 
label it, if anybody comes to 
ask me with that question. Do
 you think -- yes, there are. 
But I always -- I always give the answer why, 
as I just said it. Either those people are not 
aware, or they are guilty. They  are guilty
 of why the American government, and th e 
American people did let it happen the way it happe
ned. And th is is always going to be a 
matter -- how do you going to bring the time ba
ck, with  those people back, to be judged 
there.

Q: Let me ask you something, did you talk 
-- when you first arrive
d, and you had -- and 
you were meeting with your family in the Un
ited States, and yo -- did you ask them these 
questions at all, or did you talk about these issues? 
A: I was vocal about it right there and then . Th e majority people gave me an answer, we 
did not know. And I used to ma
dly answer them, that™s the st
ory I heard with the German 
people, they say, we didn™t know. But the st
ench of the concentration camp was in their 
backyard, and those people came saying they di
dn™t know. I says, so please, I used to 
chastise tremendously, especia
lly Jewish people, and in my
 family same way. Please 
don™t tell me you didn™t know. It was pub
licized everywhere, and you did know. The 
point was, you were too busy 
with yourself, because I had gotten answers like these here. 
My wife used to work in a ba
kery  here, as a clerk, and a lo t of times, people would say 
the same th ing. They ask her about accent 
the first thing, you know, the accent. So, 

politely you would say, ﬁOh, 
we™ve -- Holocaust survivor.ﬂ 
ﬁOh, we also had here, we 
had a depression in here.ﬂ So, when  a person
 can go ahead to metaphorize the depression 
with the Holocaust, I believe that™s a very lo
w tone, and low way of doing it. I wrote, for 
instance, to the paper, they pub
lished it, but they fixed my clock, they put in just a few 
sentences. That editorialist writer tried to ta
ke Mozamb ique, and all the other places, and 
comp are it with the Holocaust. 
I, a few times wrote it, and the last time I don -- I don™t 
get tired of writing, and I asked, how dare? 
I says, ﬁThe Jews did not ask for territory. 

The Jews did not ask for any recognition as fa
r as govern ment, or anything like that. But 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
82
 
 
 
 
in Mozambique, or in the other place, thos
e are people who are fighting political wars, 
and religious wars. Where do you comp are thes
e with the Holocaust?
 The Ho locaust had 
nothing of th at nature. The Holo caust was ju
st done, provoked by a govern ment, made up 
laws in Nuremb erg, and for one reason, 
because you were born Je
wish, therefore you 
deserved to die. Or that™s -- give them the ri ght to kill you, or all kinds of other reasons.ﬂ 
Which, you say how ca -- how can people, in th
eir sane mind, make that comp arison, be 
that it™s Kosovo, be that it™s Mozambique. Yes,
 it happens there, yes, there are atrocities 
there. Yes, the Serbs wanted to get -- get ri
d of the Albanians. Yes, the Catholics don™t 
appreciate the Moslems. Yes, the Moslems ma
ybe don™t like the Jews, or the others. We 
know that there will be dissatis
faction. But the usage of th
e word holocaust cannot, and 
should never be made over such  a analogy 
to interpret it. Because no matter which 
dictionary  in the wo rld, be Webster™s or anyb ody else, they mix in a word  of sacrifice, 

burning. Yes, we were the sacrifice for the 
hungry lions of Germany. I said it in my  
manuscript. Of course, the rewrite doesn ™t bri
ng out these kinds of sentences. But that™s -- 
what -- I cannot stand that wo
rd, that -- that wo
rd  holocaust, when you read from a 
dictionary , or certain dictionaries to say it™
s a burning, it™s a sacrifice. I cannot a-answer 

that. The Holocaust was a defi
nitely -- meaning by a governme
nt from their top level, to 
the man on the street, that he wa
s ordered, if he didn™t want it -- to do it, that this is the 
way he was graded. That was the difference be
tween going to th e front lines, or being in  
the concen tration camps, and be a commander th
ere, or whatever it is. What they got 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
83
 
 
 
 
from everything, including the gold teeth that th
ey tore out, or the watches and rings that 
took away , to send to th eir loved ones, 
or to accumulate a
ll what they did. 
Q: So are you tel -- are you saying you have tr
ouble with the word, the term holocaust, as 
it™s used? 
A: I have th e trouble for always and fo re
ver, when  anybody tried to analogize, or 
metaphorize the word  holocaust to anything th
at is going on. I give you an ex ample. 
Ghetto is another one that I have a problem 
with. When Harlem is 
called a ghetto, I wish 
to the world that they 
would only be living in these type
 of ghettos, and believe me there 
would not have been a such th
ing. When  we define ghettos,
 we must always define the 
ghetto where are we talking ab
out. The ghetto of Ro me? The ghetto of Venice, which it 
was the first? And because of grata, came into
 ghetto, because it was the steel bars that it 
was made around there, and it was near a fou
ndry, but that name was fine. So the first 
ghetto. Or, do we talk of the gh
etto of Rome, that the Jews were put there, and only for 
one reason, become Catholic, and you™re fre
e. Those little places are still left to day. 
Where it used to be the Jesuits 
used to come out to the Jews
 each time they let them out 
from the ghetto, they would sa
y, ﬁWhy don™t you become a 
Christian, and you wouldn™t 
have to live in here?ﬂ When they
 came back to return to le
t them into the ghetto, it was 
still the same [indecipherable]. 
How can anybody make that an
alogy to that word ghetto 
to use when the Black people of America were
 living in their neighborhoods? They were 
living in their neighborhoods because they felt good. Jews were living in th e Bronx, or in

Skokie because -- not that an
ybody put them ther
e, because they fe
lt good. But when a 
government puts you in  a place, and th ey ma
ke barbed wire, or an
y kind of enclosure, 
and you have to have a permit 
to go in , and you have to  ha
ve a permit going out, and you 
denied from all freedoms, you become an in
human. Are you going to comp are this here 
with a [indecipherable] neighborhood. No , I 
cannot tolerate that. A nd I doubt it any 
survivor from the Holocaust coul
d tolerate. But we know a lot 
of writers take the law in 
their own hands, and the thing they  emphasize, to
 say if i t was an air p lane who was lost, 
and so many, maybe a few hundred people go
t killed by that, they say it was a total 
holocaust. I don™t know from where they have 
the audacity, or the shortage of word s in 
their command, that they have 
to use that word holocaust, to
 make the issue be blown up 
more out of proporti
on. We are talking about six m
illion human. Sure, somebody will tell 
me that 25 million is what th
e Nazis brought over. So we™re talking about 19 -- yes, we 
must establish the old, famous word, that 
other people than Jews were killed. But the 
Jews were meant to be killed. So the othe
r people maybe c
ould have been killed by way, 
be that they were criminals, be that they we re in the way of them, or whatever it is. But 

the Jewish people were definitely meant, a
nd put by the laws, executed with armies to do 
that. So how can you analogize something 
like this, or metaphorize that word for a 
situation like that, like that woman did to, sa
y Mo zamb ique? So  she fixed my  clock. Sh e 
gave me about seven or eight lines, instead of
 like she had a big sp read. And that happens 
all the time. Like I started to tell you th at stor
y about that -- with the 10,000 Jews that he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
85
 
 
 
 
claimed Berlin had saved. It™s a lie. But th
e press will pick up these lies fast, and don™t 
give you an edge, to let you respond in the 
proper way. So, that™s democracy, I suppose. 
So, I cannot say any other way. In demo
cracy everybody gets into these here 
[indecipherable]. There will never be a perfect world, there isn™t a perfect family . You 
don™t have a family, with the same mother and 
father, and they have 
three, four kids, and 
all kids are the same. S o  my expectation, to 
have a world of such ideals, history proves 

that it never happened, and I don™t care to wh
at denomination they  belong, or to what 
religion they  adopted . We cannot do it. In or
der to do that, we woulda have to create a 
new world from A, to start in 
an -- in an [indecipherable] 
here, that you cannot leave any 
other way, but everybody™s the same, and ev
erybody feels the sa me. But we know we 
will not achieve it, and history™s not going to 
change. The least we can do is fight for the 
rights. But again, I™ll repeat it. To take a
ny situation of -- a situ
ation in history and 
metaphorize it for another situation, by that same
 name, is wrong. Do es
n™t have to be just 
Holo caust. Could have been any other usage 
of the word, like I sa
id the word ghetto. 
Which ghetto are we talking 
about? Nazi ghetto? We™re talking ab out -- or the other 
ghettos? There was alw ays the casb
ah in Africa, when we see it
 in the film. That was also 
a means of a ghetto. But that was a separation 
of doing certain things
. A neighborhood is 
not a ghetto, and let™s -- let -- let™s unders
tand each other. When  you have the freedom 

where -- to choose where you want to live, ev
en in a restricted ar
ea, e v en, let™s assume 
the niggers, as they used to be called, wh
ich it™s a -- was, I think because of the Niger 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
86
 
 
 
 
river, you know what I mean, it w a
s interpret like that, 
even at that time, 
they still had the 
opportunity of living on this street, or on that street, 
they did not go to  ask the 
government. They moved on th eir own. But th
e -- when we talk eras with Holocaust, 
when we talk about eras fro
m the ghetto, that was restrict
ed, you couldn™t, as I just 
aforementioned, with the priests, or the Jesu
its who would stay there, and tell them, why 
don™t you join us? So 
when you get the choice, how can it 
be so bad about it. As -- in the 
ghetto, I used to have to discuss it with my 
father™s brother, who wa
s a rabbi, and he was 
reminding th e 14
th
 century Spain, and he wo uld say, 
with his word s, can you imagine, 
because he was a religious pers
on, he says, ﬁGod had conferen
ce with the Jews of Spain,ﬂ 
so he let them have a choice, and those w
ho wanted to  remain 
Jews, remained Jews. 
Some were -- that it -- were 
caught, wound up with the -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
A: -- to come from w o rk, and I have seen the k
illings what they did, of  children, of so on, 
I used to be shaken up. I used 
to be shaken up, and I used to
 come -- I says, 
children, they 
did not have time to sin. Why 
were they murdered? 
An d that again comes to part of the 
analogy which I™m talk ing abou
t, or metaphor to say, when killing children, are you 
going to  comp are this here to other situati
ons? No, there is no comparison to that. That 
was a unique situation, and it mu st for history -- historical events, or history fo r the 

future, remain a unique event what it happened. 
We see a lot of times of atrocities that it 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
87
 
 
 
 
happened  to  people, but for as long governme
nts were involved  in
 these atrocities, it 
doesn ™t become a singled out case, it become
s a part. The Holocaus
t was involved from a 
government, with an army , and ev erything like 
this here to carry out. Can you imagine, 
people were denied to go to th
e front lines, for as long ther
e were good killers of Jews. 
Now, can you have anything to  comp are a 
situation like that with? You cannot.  
Q: Okay, we™re talking about being in -- in 
Chicago in the -- in the early 1950™s, and 
you™re going to school, and -- and work ing to
 establish a busin ess,
 and you have kids. 
How aware were you, and how interested were 
you in -- in political situations that were 
going on in -- in those years, or in broader 
social and cultural issu
es, or were you more 
focused on just trying to  build 
your own life, and your family
, or were you kind of aware 
of some of the -- some of the things like the -- were yo
u following th e Ko rean war, and 

those issues, or -- or the -- the Civ
il Rights movement as it started  up? 
A: I was -- became a democrat, I believe right no
w, before I even was 
justified to go to 
walt, you know, but I was a democrat. Presid en t Truman left a very big mark on me, his 
interpretation of political events
. I must say, til this day, a
lthough, in the interim of the 
years being in America as an American, and I 
didn™t miss an election that I didn™t vote, 
even -- even if it wasn™t a regular election, 
but it was just a matter of a party election, 
which it was, I always voted , because I feel
, after what I™ve been
 th ro ugh, wh ere voting 
was denied for me, where citizen
ryship was denied from me, that
 this is a privilege thing 
that one could never give up, 
and I never did, and I never fa
iled to vote. And like I said, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
88
 
 
 
 
President Truman left a big -- that buck stops he
re, he left a lot of good th ings on me, and 
through the era, every once in awhile it happened, for instance, 
I voted for President 
Reagan over President Carter, 
because I was very mad at Pres
ident Carter™s era that he 
was the president. I personally [indecipherable]
 he did not deserve to be a president. He 
made a good peanut farmer. He 
w ill never go in through histor
y as a good president. We 
lost a lot of things that we still haven™t st
raightened out because of his misjudgment. And 
I believe above all, when we are talking ab out 
the prisoners, just look wh at he did at that 
time, playing in to the hands of Khomeini wi
th Iran. We never -- we never fixed that 
rupture since then. But if he would have invoke
 at that time, our military might, which we 
had and we could, beca
use when  a country invades an emba
ssy of the next country, that™s 
a declaration of war, even if it™s not officially
 said, the word, but that
 international law is 
an in -- is immediately , it™s 
a declaration of war. So ther
efore, he was justified as 
president to do a mu ch better job than he did.
 And I believe the loss -- the horn of Africa 
at that time, and inflation th at had gone up 
to 27 and half percent, 
sure the retired people 
loved him for that, because th
ey didn™t -- some of them didn™t make as much money on 
their jobs as these inflationa
ry dollars, they thought brough
t it to them, because elderly 
people, of course, don™t spend as mu ch as
 young people. So wh
en  they got 18 and 20 
percent on their bank books, 
you know, or even 
the -- even 18 percent, that was big 
money fo r them, and you know wh at I mean, 
they want -- but look at, they wo uld have 
only turn ed around to  see that the 18 percent that
 they earned, they  ha
ve to go out in the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
89
 
 
 
 
marketplace, and pay 22 percent for 
it, if they were to buy. So
 in  the long run, they lost 
four percent, not that they gained  that mu
ch. So I mean, there wa
s a lot of good things, 
and therefore when it came Reagan
 to go for president, I did vote for him. Not for so 
much that it was a vote for him, as it was a v o
te against President Carter. I believe it™s -- 
certain elections, I™d probably cross the line, 
because I like one candidate, a cert -- over a 
certain party, better than the other one. So
, in generalizing, or -- or finalizing my  
statement, I would say, when
 you come to that little room
, and you come behind that 
curtain to vote your opinion, a person shou
ld think about a little b
it. And I was always 
thinking about who I vote for. And -- and I ha
ve been -- I am encouraging other people 
the same w ay. So yes, I became immediat
ely  an American by 
going into politics, 
meaning supporting the political will. I became
 a demo crat, and I™ve been a registered 
democrat all the years since 
we came to the United States. And hopefully, unless I see the 
Republican party grown up, and understand that
 all of us are not millionaires, and all of 
us don™t have inheritance in th
e oil, and in the others, and we still have to go out to make 
a living, so if they want our
 labor force to turn
 around and beco me a labor force of 
Mexico, I don™t say they™re justified there. Bu
t they live in Mexico, 
and if they can take 
it, with their livelihood that 
provided, fine. But here in Am
erica, as Americans, we™re 
entitled to have a Social Security, we entitled 
to have our Medicare, and we also entitled 
to all the goods of life, that is given, like a
ll others. So th erefore, wh en today we see that, 
for instance, the -- the -- the amount a person ca
n earn, I don™t care that people say he™s a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062

-- a youngster from school and goes to work
 fo r th e min i mu m wag e . T h e min i mu m wag e  
is understandable that no one can remain fo
rever. But at the same time, we mu st 
understand that sometimes in 
life there are people in between
 jobs, and when  they go in , 
and they  have to earn this me
asly few dollars, is not right. 
Again, we cannot ma ke that 
this industry belongs just to
 the kids, to school kids, or
 so  on. That would not be 
demo cratic either. And this is why I cannot
 be a Republican as yet, because the 
democrats still, at least show me the belief of
 life that ev ery American deserves to get, 
and I supported villa myself, all th e time.  
Q: In the er -- in the 1950™s, you -- you ha
d come just recently out of a Communist 

system, and you were critical of it. 
How did you feel about McCarthyism, 
[indecipherable] 

A: I was terribly disgusted with that era,
 and all, because here, I saw repetition of 
yesteryears under the Communism, not under 
Hitler, w h ere people were convicted -- in 
minds you can™t, but in open, 
to convict them before they
 even were pr
oven guilty. And 
we know the old saying in the USA, you
™re not guilty until proven. And the McCarthy 
era tried to change all of that around, and th a
nks God for sane heads, that it existed, that 
that man was removed, but the laws were no
t changed to favor him. And I hope that 
lesson serves for always. You prove first that
 a man is g u ilty, before you make him be 
guilty. And this I believe 
is the law of humanity, this is 
the law -- a law without justice is 
not -- is not a good law. And this is the j -- th
is is what it would be, a law without justice, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
91
 
 
 
 
you know what I mean, to let McCarthyism exis
t. So they just -- you gotta obey the law. 
Of course you™ll have to obey th e law, but let 
us make the laws with 
justice, so therefore 
they wouldn™t -- the laws wouldn™t beco
me law under this here circumstance.  
Q: You were raising -- I™m still 
thinking about that -- th-that sa
me era, the decade of the 
1950™s, when you™re getting settled in -- in
 the United States, a
nd -- and I™m wondering 
did you -- did you and 
your wife talk a lot about -- ab
out the Holo caust and what had 
happened , and did you talk with your ch
ildren about it when 
they were young? 
A: Okay, okay. I must confess 
again something. We never sit down per se to discuss that 
era with our kids, because our pain is -- is trem
endous, and we feel like
 that we are giving 
anguish and pain to our childre
n, would not be a justified wa
y. As a matter of fact, in a 
Jewish way, it™s definitely against that 
you should not imply anguish on someone else, 
because that™s a sin to do. 
So we never did. But my da
ughter, for instance, she's a 
principal in a school, in a Jewish school for 
the English parts. She™s got two Masters, and 
she™s now going fo r her Ph.D. She learned on
 -- about the Holocaus
t scholastically. She 
takes her schoolchildren to the museum, it used
 to b -- in Washington, D.C., at least twice 
a year, for all the years since. She was also
, while her husband wa
s starting law in the 
George Washington University in -- in D.C ., she was teaching at Bethesda, Maryland, 
and I had very good accolades about her teachi
ng, from the principal at that time. So I 
must say, she cared to
 know, and she found ou
t about it. She rehearsed a lot of times, Elie 
Wiesel™s poems and stories, and she is invol
ved in things like that. But on one -- one on 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
92
 
 
 
 
one basis, if she would ask us sometimes, 
would be different, we discussed it, but 
otherwise, to say let me tell you how th is an
d that happened, unless 
they ask, we do not 
make. With our grandchildren, maybe sometim
es, but also in the same way. We would 
not ahead to get in on the subject. Now, the 
other part I mu st tell you is, it™s a funny thing 
about the survivors of 
the Holo caust, we ma y come to a party, or we may come to a 
house as an invitation fo r dinner, and mayb
e it™s baseball season, and you talk about 
who™s going to be in  the pennant, or who™s goin
g to be in the Wo rld Series, or it could be 
football, and the same conversa
tion at this time. But we w
ill not get in maybe 50 percent 
of the time consumed together, without in
voking a part of th e Holocaust, without 
invoking a part of that era. Like, for instance
, a lot of our friends ar
e partisans, but it is -- 
that they be -- were in the fo
rest, some hidden in the forest
, but some of them are also 
former concentration camp inmates. We do no
t make the differentiation. But I noticed 
that be wherever we come, be to a wedding,
 or to come to the Days of Remembrance, 

that past era has never died 
in us, and we don™t want it to
 die. I mu st tell you from the 
standpoint of doctor, I suffer hi
gh blood pressure to this day.
 And I used to have a doctor 
who was a Holo caust survivor™s son, and when
ever I would come to him to test me, and 
he would put on the blood pressure on me, 
so before that, he would go, had -- ﬁSo, 
Harold, did you write to the paper lately?ﬂ Or
 this and that and the other. He sort of 
would provoke me to the something about this
 here. All of a sudden he takes my blood 
pressure, it™s maybe going to be
 190 over 90. ﬁHarold, I want
 you to lie down, don™t talk 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
93
 
 
 
 
to anybody, rest up, I™ll be back.ﬂ Come 
back about 10 minutes later, now th e blood 
pressure would go down. And he™d go with 
me to -- says, ﬁLook, as
 a doctor, I must tell 
you my  part, it™s no good fo r 
you, because look how mu ch
 wo rking up you do yourself 
by talking on th e issue. However, I would not wa
nt you to forget.ﬂ So, what I™m trying -- 
what I™m trying to bring out is
, the majority of us do not want
 to forget. We feel it™s a sin 
to forget what we been th
rough, all the atrocities, watc
h ing ourselves, our
 loved ones 
being mu rdered, for no other reason but bei
ng born Jewish, which it™s a mark that the 
world should carry, the new mark of Cain, of 
the biblical days of Cain and Ab el, we 
believe biblically that God made a sign on his 
forehead, and that sign we interpret was to 
be for people always to remember that he wa
s a people killer. I used to convert this here 
time through my being in America, before 
the Holo caust Museum was established, and 
while the Holocaust Museum wa
s established, I™d be askingyou to  give me the time a 

little bit more, and I will dwell on it, to make 
it. Because my analo
gy was also that the 
museums that they were built 
to -- literally to display all the past what had happened 
during th e Holo caust, is a place of learning fo r the new people to see about it, that it mu st 

be there, because that™s the 
mark of Cain, that mu st be to remind those people and tell 
them, look what it happens at an era where pe
ople remain quiet. Where people refused to 
disagree with bad laws. Where people refused to  disagree with bad leaders. That™s the 

era, what you see it happened here. So the mu se
um era, I always make
 reminission to that 
-- to the mark of Cain, of 
the same  story. I had big fi
ghts, on paper. Without being 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
94
 
 
 
 
prepared to tell you, I cannot tell you the da
te, but approximately, the date goes back 
about the numb er of years, not too many ye
ars, where on the newspaper in New Yo rk, it 
was written -- and that was the era of the bu
ilding of the Holocaust
 Museum, that there 
were a group of Jews who were against it, espe
cially the religious part. That rabbi, I don™t 
know should I men
tion his name, or not mention his name
, I hear him at the same times, 
one Sunday on the radio, wh ere he comes out 
because he was the one of the creators of 
Outreach program, which it mean s to bring Jewish
 kids back. But I™ll -- I am n o t going to 
say anything other than the facts. His name
 is Mr. Buchwalt, Ephraim Buchwalt, and he 
and me had for a year™s time, a co rrespondence,
 after the article that it appeared in the 
newspaper in New York, saying the Holoca
ust is killing the American Jews. Which it 
was a tremendu -- a tremendous shameful 
headline to be seen 
for me, a Holocaust 
survivor. I have spoken to Miles Lehrman 
when he came here to this part, in our 
synagogue, pleading to help about build ing th
e -- the museum. I believ
e every city in the 
world should have -- not as big, but a little p a
rt dedicated to the 
Holocaust, by way of 
museum. That the people shou
ld know, and a -- serve as 
a reminder, every day, wh at 
complacency does to a people. 
Not to reveal all the rest of
 the slogans what it is, but 
complacency™s what it causes. 
Fascism, Hitlerism, Nazism
, under any schism that you 
want, complacency happens to do all the bad 
things, be that it ha
ppens in our nearby 
countries, be that in Haiti for instance, or other countries, where the 
people are depressed, 
only because there is a mond of people over 
there, comp lacent to what their own has 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
95
 
 
 
 
done. So , I carried out a correspondence with  th
is person, and I tried to explain it to him. 
His article was saying that if 
this money -- he accused the mu
seum being guilty, or be the 
building, for Jewish pi -- intermarriages, becau
se after all, I gotta take the other side, a 
Catholic child, who is married out of his faith 
to a Jewish child, the ot
her family feels just 
as broken as this one. So I don™t want to 
be a one-sided with my analogy what I™m 
making over here, but so my  answer to hi
m about all the accusations over why this 
money sh ould not be spent there,
 but should be spent on educa
tion, was as follows. I said, 
those people who donated for 
the build ing of the mu seum, 
were anxious to see the 
museum built, for that reason, the mark of 
Cain. However, if you guys
 feel like you need 
a campaign to raise -- to build mo re schools,
 then why don™t you 
do it? Why do you use 
your neglect, what you didn™t do
 yourself, to try to deny a 
historical event that it must 
exist? I fought with him, one rabbi, for a ye
ar. I fought in Chicago with a head man who 
is the publisher of a paper called the Ch icag
o Jewish news, where he came up again, 
which it was almost like he read an article
, an d it came at Yom HaShoah, Remembrance 
Day of the Holocaust, he came out athird of th
e articles, caught me at
 a time w h en I was 
in Chicago, and we were the 
B™nai Brith, and I was brought -- people know th at I write to 
the papers, people know that 
I™m vocal, and at the same time,
 that I will take my time to 
write. And I was sended the paper, ﬁHarold, did 
you see that, he was inter --  to -- they 
interviewed from the Sun-Times,
 by th is, that, and the other, 
read it.ﬂ I start reading the 
first paragraph, I says, ﬁLook, it™s a repetition 
what I had to do with
 Rabbi Buchwalt, in -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
96
 
 
 
 
with New York , a few years ago. This man 
probably got the lesson from him, and he 
mentions in a different form,ﬂ after all, thanks
 God, the American lan guage is a very rich 
language with teasers, and so many wo rds th
at you can use more -- more than one way, 
but the meaning remains still the same. And I ag
ain had to learn -- give him a lesson. Of 
course, I saw it Saturday night, and on Monda
y morning, Harold Zi
ssman, with Sonia his 
wife, were right there, at the office of th
e prin ting of that paper, with askening the 
questions, how dare is he to write these kind 
of wo rds, and so  on. No body™s asking you to 
-- to donate to that. Nobody™s asking you to  co
me and visit if you don™t want to. So  if you 
cannot help anything, don™t knock it at le
ast. And if you knock it, have reasons, 
justifiable, why your side is 
right. And I had to enter with 
him with a dialog first, which 
of course the answer was he™s out of to
wn, you can™t see him,
 Mr. Zissman. I says, 
ﬁOkay, I™ll leave my message to him. I™m 
going to  leave tomo rrow for Ch icago, and I™ll 
mail you an article which I hope you print, 
because I™ll assure you -- I -- I™m preparing 
you, if you looking for de
monstrations, you™re going to  
have them. Because I, as a 
survivor, who fought in 
the underground, will not live to 
see the day that Jews will write 
these kind of things against mu seums, and ag
ainst [indecipherable]. If they are bad -- th -- 
masters of their own destiny, how to  raise m
oney to build mo re schoo
ls or better schools, 
don™t blame on somebody else, who did their 
work diligently, it™s a 
-- must be done.ﬂ 
Well, he printed my article in the paper, no
 question about it. I had another dialog with 
him, and another, afterwards there. What I™m 
trying to  say to you, ju
st like the Holocaust

is not yet understood well, while we are stil
l living, so is the bui
lding to prevent the 
future from happening definite
ly still. A lot of people come -- you know what we had 
with this Ho locaust in -- a
nd I was -- I mu st tell you, although I  know him in person, I 
wrote to him, I™m very happy that Miles Lehr
man is dismissed. And 
I hope he doesn ™t go 
against me with any publications, or anythi
ng like that. That man did -- and I wrote to 
him publicly -- of course, Mr. Birnbaum, he cam
e at that time, to respond to me, which I 
have it, the letter. Now, another letters, I ha
ve a file with letters. And let me explain 
my self, he did not respond with
 my  question it was, that he had no business mingling in 
with the Polish government, because he is only 
the head of this museum, he is not a re -- 
he is not in Madeline™s Albright™s position, 
he™s not -- you know I me
an, the Secretary of 
State, to speak to a foreign about the [inde
cipherable] in Auschwitz
, and so on, which it 
was over there. And the dealings what he st arted to do. But, it tu
rned up the museum 
almost to be a political issue, wh
ich definitely -- be the Arafat 
issue, with all of these here 
cases,  we must not forget ourselves, as I say,
 it™s a mark of Abel, it™
s a mark of learning, 
but we cannot let by all means, p o liticize eith
er the memory, or the place like museums, 
for any personal use, or pers
onal understanding. Anybody wish
es to come to see this 
museum is welcome. But to make a dignitary i
ssue, like to make this here because he is 
[indecipherable]. I don™t care if the pope wo
uld come, and he wants to see Yad Vashem. 
If he will be there, I assure you, he™s goi
ng to be greeted as a pope, yes, but no 
politicizing issues will ever grow
 out of that. And the same 
thing goes for anybody else, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
98
 
 
 
 
whether they are Moslem, whet
her they are Catholic, or B
uddhist, or whatever it is. 
Come and see, what it happened
 in an era, when people be
came silent to murder for no 
reason, and no cause, only becau
se by being burn -- born on th
e wrong side of the street. 
And this will be an outspoken thing for me 
to say when anybody 
du -- even while it™s a 
good thing the ma -- th e 
m -- the museum exists. It™s a bad 
thing of a Mr. Rioch, or any of 
the other people, over this person. He™s not ed
ucated well enough to le
ad that part -- that 
he is. But he was a good person politically, to
 raise money for thepa
rty, and so on. And 
that™s what he got there. I hope, since you™re 
a young lady, and involved in that, that we 
see for the future that no po
litics should ever co
me between the museum -- the Holocaust 
Museum, the memorial of these here six milli
on, or if you want to speak for 25 million 
that were there, to ever let politics take ov er, and make this a showplace that people 
should co me to politicize. I, as long I can, will always write about it, to whoever the 

parties are, be it Miles Lehrman, be it Rabbi
 Weiss giving th e accolades about it. And I 
just wrote, it™s still not published in the Jewish journal, I wrote to ak -- of course, to give 
him a kudos for what he tirelessly continued with his camp aign, because he exposed  all 
these issues, with a lot of us didn™t know 
what it was going on. Because you gotta have 
an access, you know what I mean
, way to get into that. But in
 a general term, I must tell 
you, I was always, and will always be vocal for the rights -- be -- w h ichever it -- way it 

is. It could be my  own 
brother if -- I wish he would be 
alive, if he would do something 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
99
 
 
 
 
wrong, I would be vocal about it to say, ﬁYou
™re wrong, my  brother, you should not have 
done it, or you di -- shouldn™
t have done it that way.ﬂ  
Q: How is it that you™re finding out all th 
-- did you ju st say that
 it was your rabbi who 
was giving you all the informa
tion about what™s going on? 
A: No, Rabbi Weiss writes -- and he is in Ri
verdale if you know, and he carries on -- he™s 
the head of an organization called Zamp a, 
which it means a folks organization of the 
people. And he often -- again, I like him, 
because he was outspoken, all the time. I like 
him because he went to Auschwitz, although 
he was accused that he tried to beat the 
nuns, wh ich it was a pure lie. But you see, 
people like him, like my self, who are not 
afraid to expose your name, or 
to go to  speak out wh at you really mean, but in th e right 
way. That™s the very important thing. I coul
d be right, but I must express it in the right, 
and the proper way, and the same way. He 
didn™t try to knock anyb
ody down, but he was 
speaking out for the right. And the rights of t
hose people mu rdered, laying there, have a 
right at least -- I don™t say it™s gotta be the Ma
gen David, or anything, but they  have -- or 
the eternal light, but have a right not to be converted now, y -- after death, posthumously . 
There was some Jews who converted, okay, so
 that™s their business. There are Jews who 
believe in Jesus, that™s their 
business. But let™s not go ahea
d to make a political issue out 
of an era, as such. We must 
remember that, and we must fi
ght for it, to see not to let 
others do. That™s -- that™s
 always my statement. 
Q: Okay, Mr. Zissman is now goi
ng to read one of his poems. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062

A: This poem is headlined, ﬁMy Prayer in P
light of a Dream. The di
stant forest, with the 
thick bush, swamp, and quicksand, birds ch
irping, humming to no end, under tall trees 
and trails. Nature™s way to pr
eserve and protect, as ever
yone™s land. The woodpecker, 
with his loud noise, building his nest prevails
. The crow, with loud, crying flight, as if 
dangerous on th e way, to signal the others about
 the plight in their 
midst. The robin -- the 
robins, and b -- and hummi
ngbirds, are all astound to what 
may, busy with th eir catch, to 
quench hunger, in view  of the 
beast. A kingdom of their own, all around. How safe could 
it be for me? The fenced ghetto 
mu st not be in the way. I mu
st escap e now to the forest, 
with big trees, and bush, birds, beast, insect
s, danger. Leave family
 and ghetto behind, a 
place to fight and hide. Time is 
short, I must decide, the forest
 is the place to escape. Dear 
God, gran t me those wings of a bird, to fly an
d be safe, so I could fly from trunk to twig, 
from twig to branch. To
 the forest, to join the fight, no
t hide, to escape the murder. Oh 
God, grace me with those wings so I may surviv
e, and be free. Grant me life, to remain 
your servant, to reveal your
 grace always. I must be a witness to tell how hell came down 
to earth, to destroy the people of the book
. Who™ll be your new ch ildren? Mu st we all 
vanish? We are  your ch ildren, can™t you gran
t us life? Why all that mu rder? No  pray er, 
no cry, no plea. Must we all die? Where are 
you people? Are you goin
g to remain silent 
to murder? I shall fight to su
rviv e, tell our sorrow, ask where was ma n and God?ﬂ See, I 
never speak just to God alone when I™m as
king ab out people coming to tell me , didn™t 
that bother you to ask th e question where wa
s God? And I, my  answer has always been 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
101
 
 
 
 
the unique answer to say. I don™t know wh er
e God is, but I do know wh ere man is, and I 
see man. So my  question was always be, wher
e were man, and then I ask where was God. 
Because man were visible, and seen. So I can
not unleash my sorrow, a
nd datday to God. I 
still remain  [indecipherable] to man, and his 
life. To people, and not just to God. So 
therefore, it could never be misunderst
ood by my  way, the way 
I see all what had 
happened , all the sorrow storie
s to tell, and all the innocent people who were mu rdered 
just for being born Jewish. 
End of Tape Three, Side B

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is tape number fou
r, of an interview w
ith Harold Zissman. 
When  you moved to  
the Chicago area, did you move to Sk okie right away ? 
A: No, I -- at first, we were living like a ma
nsion to you, in a basement apartment wh ere 
we came. Then, wh en  my  son was born, and 
my  brother-in-law with us, in 1949, we 
could no longer live in that apartment, a
nd I had to pay under 
the table, because 
apartments were not available, and it was illeg
al to charge any higher rent. So that was 
the means by which way one could 
get an apartment, is to pay 
under the table. It was sort 
of like a -- a guy gave that as a donation. That™s
 what I was asked to say, and to write on 
my  check, that that was a donation, upon this
 donor, to be given to  his famous charity, 
whatever, he -- he dedicated it to. We move
d on Edison Street, which it was more known, 
as about 10 blocks away  from Ka
pp™s park, that we were livi
ng th ere, and there we got on 
the third floor, a four room apartment, whic
h it was huge by comparison of living in two 
f-- rooms in a b -- in two rooms in a baseme
nt apartment. And no 
air conditioning, of 
course, for -- and we had two children. My brot
her-in-law, at that particular time was no 
longer with us, because he was drafted to the ar
my. He came to the States late in ™48, and 
in ™49 with th -- with
 that outbroke -- break in Ko rea, he was drafted in the American 
army , and he, believe it or not, was sent back 
to Germany, in the same places where he 
wore a -- a -- as a camp inmate -- I™m mean
ing as a DP camp inmate, there he was 
serving with the amer -- with 
the US uniform, as a soldier. No
w, when he came back, and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
103
 
 
 
 
we were living still in these four rooms, all 
of a sudden the four ro
oms became too small 
for all of us. So we had to go ah ead and tr
y to get another apartment, and times were 
terrible at that time to get a
nother apartment. Each time I lo
oked an apartm
ent with three 
bedrooms, they asked us the question, whic
h it was an infamous item to be asked to 
Holo caust survivors, do you have any kids? 
That was a painstaking 
answer. I says, ﬁWhy 
would I want a six room ap-apartment if I 
wouldn™t have any kids?ﬂ 
ﬁWell, but we don™t 
want to rent to little kids that you have wi
th it.ﬂ And that I kept on and on til -- I was 
vigorous enough at that time 
to go ahead and de-decide to  buy
 on my own. I wasn™t ready 
for a home, so we bought a three flat buildin
g, at that particular time, which it was in 
West Roger™s Park in Chicago, one of the 
very upcoming, beautiful neighborhoods. And 
we lived there til our ch -- til my daughter was of
 the age to go to high school. And at that 
particular time the run was for Skokie. And 
in Sk okie the high schools were very good, 

and they  were upgrad ed . So  my  daughter decide
d that she™d rather go to the high school 
in Skokie, and my  son and my  daughter 
both graduated from Sk
okie High School. And 
while in Skokie -- Niles East was the name of 
the schools. And while in Skokie again, I -- 
I became organized in the Je
wish community, and I mainta
ined at that time, my 
membership with the B™nai Brith, and it was the B™nai Brith who really dealt me a bad 
card at the time, when this -- when the Nazis 
decided th at they want to move in Skokie, 
and being the advice that we got from the B™na
i Brith, was very counter to the belief aw -
- for me as a survivor, and ev
erybody else. Their advice to us was, ﬁLet them march and 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
104
 
 
 
 
do th eir talking, draw your curt
ains and don™t mind anything at
 all. And if they won™t get 
any -- any people to come listening to  them, 
they probable decide not to co me.ﬂ Our 
advice was not to listen to these kind of ways
, because basically they were not ex ercising 
Freedom of Speech. They were ex
ercising their hate for one thing, and the threat of our 
lives for the second. Well, we just got freed
 from all those things, that we had to go 
through over again. I already 
mentioned, I believe, in the former tape, didn™t I? Did I 
mention about the [indecipherabl
e] justice department, I alre
ady said it to you on th at -- 
on th e tape over here, right? 
Q: You mentioned -- you  mentioned the -- 
a little bit about Skokie, and you mentioned 
getting onto the Ph il  Donohue show, an
d you mentioned going to testify. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: But -- but tell me a little b
it more about the background 
of it. Were you -- were you 
involved with survivor
™s groups in Skokie? 
A: Okay, I™ll tell it now. While I belonged, as 
I said, to t h e B™nai Brith, in Skokie was the 
first chapter we organized to commemo rate
d the name of Janoush Korchuk. Janoush 
Korchuk really was an assimilated Jew, but he 
was Jewish at heart, and at that particular 
time, he was living outside of 
the ghetto, but he moved into th
e ghetto, and he opened  up 
orphanag e houses, which I believe i-is -- he
™s well documented, even through the United 

Nations, and wh en th at Janoush Ko rchuk, wh
o was a healer, a doctor of philo sophy and 
everything, the way he composed those child
ren , who were already orphaned , and he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
105
 
 
 
 
was with them. The day came when they want
ed to eliminate the ch
ildren in the ghetto, 
and it was called upon him to surrender the 
children from his -- fro m his home, to the 
Nazis. He refused, he says, ﬁWherever my 
children go, I™m going to
 go with them.ﬂ So 
which it means they want
ed to grant him life, but he deci
ded rather to  face death in the 
same manner his children. And his way was, 
ﬁIf I cannot survi -- if my  children cannot 
survive, there was no use for me
 to surviv e.ﬂ So that™s a story of importance for everyone 
to rememb er, and I believe in the realm of
 B™nai Brith, and Anti-Defamation League, we 
found the survivors who were 
living in Skokie, and who were
 members of B™nai Brith to 
open up another lodge, and that
 lodge was named under Jano
ush Korchuk, wh ich at many 
times, on other occasions, I spoke, even on th
e Days of Remembrance, when  I had the 
opportunity to be the spokes
man, I mentioned Janoush Korc
huk, and his brave actions, 
what he did by trying to  save the kids, even  in
 the bad days, as it w ere, to keep them at 
least human, until the end. And he did not refuse
 a bit about it. From there on, as I say, 
living in  Skokie and -- and belonging now to th is
 here B™nai Brith lodge, so when the era 
came about the Nazis wanting to march in Sk
okie, and threatening our lives, I became 
very vocal about it. First of 
all, what I did, it was at c
ity hall on th at Monday, which it 
was a normal meeting, I talked to some guys 
and to ld them that we all should gather at 
the Skokie city hall, and tell them our grievanc
es over why we do not agree to see that the 
Nazis come to Skokie. I 
was the first of the group to be 
called to speak, and I voiced my  
opinion against it, why we do not have to 
see and repeat our sufferings to accommodate 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
106
 
 
 
 
another group in  our society. They could ma
ke their venture any time, anyway s, I cannot 
stop them from speaking. But why should we 
allow them to come 
in our homes, and 
disobey the law, to go ahead to
 spill their hate and venom onall of us, against our lives, 
since we already went through all of that, 
and became survivors. Must we go thro ugh the 
agony again, just to satisfy 
a segment of people? Why couldn™
t they speak on television, 
radio, wherever they want to, but not co
me and threaten us in our homes, and 
playgrounds, wherever we live, and raise ne
w children? Word s got around, an d we got a 
big crowd at night fo r the meeting. I was asked a question, from the city hall 
commissioners, and I was asked, what if we 
grant them the permit, that -- the meeting 
was basically to determine whet
her the city hall will grant a pe
rmit to the Nazis to come 
to Skokie. And I was asked what will I do at 
the time, if the Nazis get the permit, and 
they come to Skokie. And I po
litely answered the co
mmissioner at that particular time, I 
says, ﬁI cannot tell you now wh at I would do 
at time of anger. You know, when  a person 
gets angry, and an anger of that type, I don™t know, will I grab a stone, will I grab a 
bottle, whatever I will do to thro
w and disrupt probably, all of 
that.ﬂ He says, ﬁWell, you 
know, it™s against the law to do it.ﬂ I says, ﬁIt™
s -- in my ways of life, it™s against the law 
for me to re-live the agony one more tim
e, Commi ssioner. So I hope you, as the 
lawmaker and obeyer, can see 
that we survivors here, and 
for that ma tter, anybody we -- 
who is not a survivors, have 
to go through the agony of bei
ng threatened with their lives, 
by th ese group of mu gs, and pe
ople, who call themselves th
e neo-Nazis.ﬂ Well, needless 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
107
 
 
 
 
to say that they did pass the 
law, the attorneys advised them
 that it must be -- go ahead 
and granting in the law, with the rights of 
th e Second Amendment of
 Free Speech. Well, 
now we had to get re-o rgan ized
 ag ain, we opened up our offi
ce, and began to get ads in 
the paper. Skokie became so public that we 
-- people from Africa, people from Australia, 
wherever [indecipherable] everybody was gran
ting us the courage fo r we doing it, and 
gave us the mo ral support, a
nd ev en offered financial support, wh atever it may take. We 
mastered  to come out on the 
Phil Donohue show, at that par
ticular time, in public. And it 
was a -- fro m the Civil Liberties Union, a ma
n, Goldberger, which he was Jewish, who 
was the one defending them. My question to 
him was, does his heart allow him -- and his 
conscience, to go, to  protect this bloody 
era of Jewish annihilation? Of course, Phil 
Donohue didn™t let me get close. He didn™t le
t me. But I, with my persistency, did not s-
succumb to him not letting, and out of place, I yelled long enough til 
he had to come with 

the microphone to me, to be heard. My daught
er, at that particular time, was living in 
Florida already, and she called me  afterwar
ds, ﬁOh, Daddy, I saw you -- I saw you on 
television. You™re still fighting, looks like 
to me.ﬂ That was her words to me. I says, 
ﬁYes, my  dear, my  fight did not end, obviously. 
I didn™t think that I™ll have to fight, but I 
must rise up again and fight again. That mena
ce has got to get done with.ﬂ That was my  
answer to her. Our fight, as I say went on; 
meeting -- meetings used to take place at 
times, evenings to last til one o™clock in th
e morning. And we had 
various plans of how 
to start. There was even at one time a plan 
that we actually wanted to attack their base, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
108
 
 
 
 
what they  had on the south side of Chicago. 
But after big pleas by attorneys, who were in 
touch with us, from the establish ment of Jewi
sh organizations, and the B™nai Brith kept 
appealing the same thing, draw your cu rtains
 and don™t come. That™s the best that they 
could offer for us, which by all means, I had 
to tell some B™nai Brith people, ﬁNow I see 
why you did not act out against the situati
on when we were being murdered.ﬂ I says, 
ﬁBecause that™s your only solu
tion, draw your curtains, a
nd don™t look. And then the 
same thing goes, put something in your ears, 
and you don™t listen, or
 you don™t hear. We 
cannot succumb to 
that menace,ﬂ I said. And we orga
nize groups all the time, and see 
what the plide could do. The 
Jewish establishment in Chic
ago, with  the lawyers who 
volunteered to our help, suggested 
that we are to see i -- i -- Sp
ringfield, Illinois, the state 
capital, and we must inaugurate another law, 
that since freedom of speech mu st be given 
to them -- we tried to fight, th
at yes they can come, even to
 Skokie and speak, but they  
cannot wear these Nazi uniforms. We made
 an appearance there, and my appearance 
unwillingly, was very successful, because I rea
lly brought out the call of freedom, I really 
brought up today meet was ex
actly on D-Day, where all my
 compatriots, who were 
speakers, and former soldiers, and fighters a
nd commanders, did not have the audacity to 
remember the day it was. I, however, the pain  was too fresh on me to forget D-Day, 
because D-Day meant a big time for us at that 
particular time to see that. An-And things 
like that, you ju st don™t forget, or mete out 
of the calendar. And I was, after all, became 
renown -- known. We had a lot of gatherings
 going on, and at one time, we wanted to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
109
 
 
 
 
state our case, so in the JCC, we were divi
ded in three speakers. We had a speaker from 
the Holocaust survivors who wa
s an inmate in the concentr
ation camp. I was the one who 
represented the partisans, and resistance, and there was -- 
Q: Say names if you can rememb er names. 
A: Well, Rosensweig was one of the spea
kers, which he was -- his wife was later 
president, who she was representing those Je
ws who were in -- in -- in Russia. Our 
president™s -- I must say, our la
te president, at that time, 
which she was a woman, and sh e 
was very vocal about the issues, she was ve
ry  mu ch in-involved. Her name is Erna 
Gense, and she was talking in regard, or
 rather, representing the inmates of the 
concen tration camp. I, Harold Zissman, was taki
ng part, speaking abou
t resistance in the 
partisans. And we were very successful, th
e room was filled with people, and questions, 
while we only were thinking it™
ll be an hour to two hours, it 
was after three hours that we 
had to call a halt to the meeting, and call it 
for continuance of every day. Another thing 

we organized about, that was all to lighten in
g the situation of [indecipherable]. I had, 
after that, one student that he was studying 
in medical sc hool, but he was a Je wish boy, 
interested in Jewish history, that he asked me if he could come to my house, and I will 

give him on tape all my story, why and wh at
, when -- no more than we discussed it. He 
came to my  house, and made a few tapes, and 
afterwards he says, ﬁHarold, I don™t know 
how you survived , but I cannot listen to it.ﬂ He
 says, ﬁIt was too much.ﬂ I says, ﬁThat™s 
the part of perseverance, and that™s the pa
rt of endurance. If you wa
nt to go on to  live, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
110
 
 
 
 
you cannot surrender easily. You 
must keep your fight to 
the bitter end, just like I 
described in  some of my  poems, as it was.
ﬂ Anyway s, the other 
organization what we 
did, we decided on the Sabbat
h to send various groups to go 
to synagogues, bring out our 
situation on the pulpit, over why our dissatisf
action is with the Nazis do -- who want to 
march. We are trappened, and all of us are 
trappened. We know that we don™t want to 
have any -- any bad situation, 
maybe turning in to riots, or 
whatever it is, where it could 
threaten the business community. 
So therefore, for all things 
concerned, the best thing is, 
by which ever way we can derive
, that it should be legal and official to stop that march 
from coming, because at that particular tim
e, the Jewish Defens
e League, which it was 
very famous in New York, joined
 us, and th ey wanted to beco
me a party with us, to join 
in the fight against the Nazis.
 So, when the joish -- the -- th
e Jewish League came to us, 
the joining, it was a more scare on the merc
hants in the area, because now th ey knew 
with the Jewish Defense League
 around, that definitely hos tilities will ic -- incur in the 
neighborhood. So, we ask what
 can we do about it? Anyway
s, by that time, the law 
passed in -- in -- in Springfield, and it was pa
ssed, but it was afterwards challenged, that 
it was illeg al that this, in itself, 
th e uniform in itself was declared also part of speech, and 
we cannot stop it. Well, be that it was right, 
be that it was wrong, maybe the legal heads 
that we had trying to  help us were not the 
greatest, and the best, but it™s a known factor 
that American people, including th e Jews, do not
 ever want to see a 
change in the Second 
Amendment of Free Speech. I perhaps feel the 
same way, but it™s too hard for me to

succumb  to the idea that Free Speech, and th
reatening of life should be one and the same, 
and therefore granted immunity 
for that reason. That™s why, 
until this day outspoken, that 
it was justified for us to stop them. However, be
 for what it™s worth, that it did occur in 
Chicago later, that we were denied our law, 
and th ey came out to speak, but we started 
the same th ing, as I said, we were throwing
 rocks, and eggs, and 
whatever you wanted, 
and the only thing it lasted for 
about three -- two minutes, or 
four, and they were -- had to 
be run out. The fact remains that later 
on we found out that those neo-Nazis were 
involved in so many la
wbreaking things that they did. 
We found out the head of a Mr. 
Collins, that he was involved with -- with se
xual things, involved  -- and he was brought 
to court -- o -- justice, and he was jailed late
r. Which it proves, no mo re, and no less like 
Hitler and his gang, they were all not law ab
iders, but law breakers, but we granted the 
freedom. And of course, I was -- it was interpre
ted to us to tell this is the democracy in 
action, that a -- that we must be listening 
to  everybody who  wants to speak. Yes, 
listening to whatever we want to speak. Bu t listening to so meone who threatens my life, 

one day I hope, will be separated from Freed
om of Speech, because it™s the same as 
yelling fire in a crowded movie house, which 
this is not Freedom of Speech. And we 
continued our fight later, while I already afor
ementioned being in the -- speaking for the 
justice committee, and as I said, the law passe
d, and we again had a 
fight on our hands. 
No matter what itch we tried -- we stopped it. It
 was the fact to show
 wh at had happened . 
We were stopping that we shouldn™t any mo re
 tal -- go to let them demonstrate, so the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
112
 
 
 
 
city hall, and it™s legal people advised, and 
devised an issue [indecipherable] prohibited, 
those people living in th e neighborhood mind yo
u, were prohibited to  
go out in that area 
where the Nazis, if it comes 
to pass that they will come to
 speak, so it means we were 
taken the laws of freedom away from us, that 
we could not go walk 
in that perimeter, 
while they, under the protection of the law,
 will be guided to let them come in and 
speech. Well, that™s a good less
on to prove what Freedom of 
Speech means. I agree with 
it, but I don™t agree at the cost of another part of the public, to be denied the laws. I 
believe something over there was not -- acting 
wrong. And we -- we mustered a lot, and 
since the Civil Liberties Union were protecting 
the Nazi so mu ch, we decided we mu st hit 
them where it hurts, in their pockets. Our 
campaign continued, and we broke them 
actually, that they did not ha
ve enough contributions, and you know, the legal people are 
very -- trying to  legal, but they  wanted mone
y for their time, and lo
oks like they had to 
abandon the whole thing. That
™s why, in sko -- in Skokie, they couldn™t mu ster up and 
come to march. But in
 Chicago, around city hall, even
 if it only lasted for two minutes, 
and the amount of money that it cost the city 
to allow that to happ
en, between the police, 
extra time, and ex tra vigilance that it -- 
they needed, was ext -- was a tremendous 
amount. I™m glad to hear that it never happen
ed, another case like that, over there. In 
Florida a few times, there were also marches 
by th e neo-Nazis, but they were done in a 
different way. They didn™t go to the heig
ht of Collings, and his gang. There were 
different ways with them. And it was on one side
 the Nazis, and on the other side was the 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
113
 
 
 
 
anti-Nazis, us. And we proteste
d in loud ways, not to let th
em be heard, over hel -- and 
then it was all over. So, the means to say is, it
 happened , but never did it reveal itself to 
be a case like in Skokie, because over there wa
s the hard core of survivors, and that™s 
what they wanted, and 
they almost -- almost won the ba
ttle to come and speak, but we 
prohibited them.  
Q: Tell -- tell  me, did you -- was there, to
 your perception, co mp lete unity among 
survivors in -- in the Skokie 
case, or was there any dissensio
n between surviv ors at all, 
about wh at ought to happen? 

A: It™s a good question you made, and I™m glad
 that you asked it in a way, because the 
movie of Sk okie did not bring it out. There 
was no deception, but before long, it was so 
politicized, the issue, that it was unbelievable. I had over there, amo ngst us, as I 
mentioned before, the Jewish Defense League
. Before long, it took a lon -- I took a look, 

some Communists were also tryi
ng to  join us, and by all means, we did not want to have 
a part of no red flag, no this here. So this
 was the bad part, in part, dissension, no, but 
joiners, of various opinions, which definitely 
was not in our way, we
 found to -- to -- to 
be the case.  

Q: And you mentioned a little
 earlier, Rabbi Montrose? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Were you a memb er of his congregation? 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
114
 
 
 
 
A: Well, I was a part member of his cong
regation, because I belonged to another 
congregation. I always belonged someplace. 
As a matter of fact, our B™nai Brith 
meetings, still to this day today, take place on Ma
in Street,  in se -- in Skokie central, as 
we call it, where Rabbi Montrose, still, God 
willing, presides as th e rabbi. The rabbi was 
a very vocal helper now, of course, and as I 
forementioned, we went to synagogues, too, 
and the -- Sk okie™s central synagogue was all w
ith the help we needed
 to be granted.  
Q: Did -- did you -- you mentioned feeling an
gry with the B™nai Brith, because of their 
position in the -- in the case. Did you -- how 
did you -- how did that resolve itself? I 
mean, you s -- you just mentioned you -- you co
ntinued to be involved with B™nai Brith. 
A: They had a letter cam -- writin g campaign 
to B™nai Brith, and our words was, if you 
cannot help us, don™t hurt us. In other word s,
 it™s too bad that you interpret it one way, 
and we see it the other way. To us it™s Free
dom of Speech, yes, but however, threatening 
our life is no freedom. So I believe B™nai Br
ith does -- wouldn™t lik
e to see that way, 
either. And we asked them, just stay neutra
l and leave us -- leave 
us alone, because you 
advised us not -- make us comf
ort. You make comfort to the enemy instead of making us 
comfortable about it. And I didn™t resign fro
m being a memb er of B™nai Brith, because 
one bad issue does not make you to turn  ag
ainst Anti-Defamation League, because that™s 
what we was trying to claim it. W e are be
ing a -- defame d over there, and you -- you 
permission, what you are saying, is let de
famation take place, wh
ile you trying to say 
draw your curtains. You know wh at I mean, or 
sort of shut your ears, you don™t hear. But 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
115
 
 
 
 
that is not the way to handle a situation lik
e that. And thanks God that later on, B™nai 
Brith, I believe, is becoming mo re mature about 
some of these situations, and they realize 
that it was not the right thing to
 answer to us, just draw your curtain, because as a whole, 
B™nai Brith did lose some members also, in th
e same way. I didn™t -- you know, our lodge 

still remain ed very viable, and everything lik
e that, but you know, a lot of other people 

did not want to just register the mi ldness to
 the resolution, as we did, and they just 
absolutely resigned, and it was hard 
to bring th em back in there.  
Q: Did you feel disillu sioned with the American
 judicial system after the whole case, and 
after -- after it was decided that yes, the -- 
the First Amendment was going to be upheld 
in the form that it had been? 

A: As I said, I™m all for the Fi
rst Amendment. I™ll go to fight, if I have to, to survive -- for 
the First Amendment to survive.
 However, we must literally 
understand, that threatening 
of life is not a First Amendment right to be
 treated under Freedom of Sp eech. We mu st 
modernize it, if needed, we mu st amend things
 in it, but that cannot -- should not be. We 
don™t know when, tomorrow, wh en another branch of these hating groups will come up. 
We know what it happ
ened  in Memphis, we know what
 it happened with all. But the 
Jews were on th e side to help th e Black 
people, and can you im
agine that anybody™s 
going to  tell me that it was a matter of Fr
ee Speech? No, it was not a matter of Free 

Speech, it was a matter plain, they wanted to 
kill, they wanted to 
destroy, and killing and 
destruction happened . We know
 just recently, only a year ago, wh at it happened in 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
116
 
 
 
 
Chicago, with the things that it happened agai
nst synagogues. We know the things that it 
happened  th ere in schools. You see, this 
is all the outgrowth fo
r people who harbor 
themselves under the First Ame
ndment right to speak, with right to hate, okay we -- we a 
-- I know the ADL was very helpful in these cas
es, to pass laws against hate -- law. But 
it™s -- it™s a different situation 
between hated laws, and that causes them to be violent, or 
to come and trap them, openly. Neo-Nazi
s do not come others -- under any other 
auspices, but threatening the lif
e of the Jews wherever they 
are. And we mu st learn how 
to separate, so yes, I am pro-Second -- 
th-the Amendment, th
e way it was written, 
Freedom of Speech, but as I sa
id it, and I cannot reveal it 
again, how many times I say, 
that threatening of life, must be put -- it will
 take an extra amendmen
t to it, just like the 
hate law was passed, it mu st pass this part of
 the hate law, whatever
 it is, that people™s 
lives cannot be threatened 
by any group, by any ways.  
Q: Tell me about how th at whol
e event in Skokie, a-and the 
legal proceedings wh ich took 
s -- took -- took about a year, I think to  -- to unfold . 
A: Yes. 
Q: How did that affect your 
perception of yourself as an  American citizen, and -- and the 

American -- did you -- did you feel connected  w
ith -- with the country at large, in -- in a 
sense of -- or did you feel
 a little more isolated af
terwards? [indecipherable] 
A: No, to the contrary, I felt
 very much American at the 
time. I know in the Civil War, 
we just didn™t throw slogans, 
and won. It took blood almo
st, and fighting. Thanks God 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
117
 
 
 
 
that we did not have to shed 
any blood in order to
 do things like that. 
So no, never will I 
be isolated from the American freedom of law.
 However, in all my lif
e that God gives me 
to live, I will fight for freedom with justic
e. I cannot afford to let my mind or soul 
separated one from the other. There is no freedom 
if there is no justice. So be that justice 
means that it was not for -- not letting Jews, or
 Blacks move into a certain neighborhood, 
or be sitting in the back of a 
bus. Be to the same thing is, 
when I am denied certain laws, 
whatever it has to be, that is not justice in these laws. So I hope that we rememb er the 
importance. Freedom must be with justice. 
Freedom without justice is not total freedom. 
Q: Okay , I wanted to  ask you ab out something 
else, but I™m going to flip the tape first. 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: -- and -- and -- and important for many survivor
s, as well as just for -- for history of -- 
of reckoning with the Holocau
st, and that was the Eichmann 
trial. And I wondered if you 
can recall whether you -- you wa
tched that carefully, whether 
you talked about that with 
other people, and wh ether you felt that that 
was -- that th at was an important event. 
A: Okay, I -- first of all, let me to uch, before
 I go to this here, I must put it in, I want to 
thank the people, Mr. -- Mr. Garber, what his 
name was, the produce
r of Skokie. Burger, 
Mr. Burg er was his name of the producer, fo
r producing that movie. I believe, as time 
goes on, it will remain  a vocal part of the hi
story of Skokie. The mayor of Skokie, we 
took at that time to Israel on 
a trip, he™s no longer around 
-- the former mayor that it was 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
118
 
 
 
 
at the time. But it was a historical event, 
and I™m gla -- happy and glad, that someone 
took the time and efforts, even the financial co
st, to bring it into light. At the same time, I 
want at this time, to thank all the other 
people, i-including those who pro -- made the 
movie of ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ including -- I forgot his name. 
Q: Spielberg? 

A: Yeah. Including Mr. Spielberg, who gave so
 mu ch effo rts, and money of his cost, to 
bring these programs, even -- even part what 
he is paying for in 
the Holocaust museums, 
to bring the story of the survivors of the Ho
locaust, for posterity, so some students of 
tomo rrow can learn what it was done wrong in 
our time, and in our 
era, so it shall not 
repeat itself again. When the Eichmann stor
y, which you asked me
, took place, I was 
very carefully watching it on the TV. And it prov
ed that the bitter end,
 that instead of him 
asking forgiveness for the inju
stice that he carried out, mu
ch more than the law of 
Nuremb erg asked him to do, he stand fast to pr
otect the Nazi era, and he™ll, to the last 
day, and to the last mo ment of that trial,
 stood with his opinion th at it was right to do 
what he does. Which it proves it to you, th
e freedom, and the democracy, given to a 
mu rderer like this here, was given by the state 
of Israel. And, at th
e same time, of other 
people, we know the case what
 it happened, it proved the cas
e in point, after th e case of 
Eichmann, then the case of Demjanjuk was bro
ught to Israel. And Israel believed in the 
fairness of the law in judicial way. Even th
ough he was proving th at in Trawniki, he was 
serving, in spite that he was 
not even th-the -- even grossl
y -- even th-the hater, but he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
119
 
 
 
 
was there in the schools. So seeing as they did not have the total 
accuracy missing to the 
justice of the Israeli court, to condemn him, or to sue him for what
ever it is, they much 
rather for letting him go free instead of cond
emning perhaps, in the mind of the -- of the 
judges to condemn a s -- a person who was no
t guilty in the case. 
Now, here is a big 
importance for Israel law to be predominan t, a
nd all the world to take, that they believe in 
the old saying -- in th e Communist era, as 
well as the Fascist era through the Nazis, 
they™d  rather kill a hundred  people to find on
e guilty, while this wa
y, when laws arvee 
justice, you™d rather let a hundred  people 
free, instead of condemning one people -- one 

person who is not fully guilty. That it couldn™t 
prove the guilt on him. I am proud to  hear 
these things. 
Q: Did you think -- were you aware of how th
e American public was responding to that, 
and that how that -- that things
 might have changed as far as
 amir -- American awareness 
of wh at had happened  during th e Holo caust af
ter the Eichmann trial was telev ised in this 
country? 

A: Well, American people have haters, like a
ll other countries of the world. We know 
Buchanan for instance, who are 
the defender of Demjanjuk, a
nd we know the ta -- at the 
tail end of it, that demjan -- 
that Buchan an to ld his way of the war, and ev erything, that 

he claims America did wrong, by coming to he
lp diminish the Nazi 
era. So this question 
is a self cen tered to understand the -- for ever
y American just to sa
y, look in the mirror 
and see yourself. When we could have a man 
who was in the era, wo
rking with President 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
120
 
 
 
 
Reagan, to come out with a 
book the way he was written, so
 it™s a v ery sordid on the 
American people, because thanks God that we
 don™t have many Buchanan s around, so we 
can still call ourselves a country of loving free
dom, but not with this type of freedom that 
Mr. Buch anan would like to see going on in
 th is country. As a whole, I believe the 
American people I never could condemn . I can
 only say not many American people are 
involved in the political 
systems, and they -- if 
they don™t take a part
 in it, it™s basically 
because they -- they cannot 
be participant without knowing 
cases. And they don™t take 
the time to learn it, they feel 
so free that we don™t have to. But to preserve our freedom, 
we must be participants in 
all these here political eras.  
Q: You -- have you experienced any an ti-Sem
itism directly since you™ve been  in this 
country? 
A: I had a few cases where I had to  send my
 cases to the Anti-Defamation League. In 
most cases, when I ever wrote an article deal
ing with the Holocaust,
 or for instance when 
the pope was visiting the USA at that time, an
d I reminisced in my article to the paper 
that he was a young pope -- not 
pope, but he was a young preach
er, at that time in Poland, 
and living in  that era, he should know what 
the Hitlerites did to us, and I was speaking 
out against Pope Pius, not against him. I, as a 
matter of fact, went through in Israel with 
Yad Vash em, to make a study of that era, an
d the whole world knows 
the secret that the 
Vatican helped all these here criminals filte
r through Spain, and ot
her places lik e this 
here. But it™s the funny thing, when you brin
g it out in th e open, some people don™t like 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
121
 
 
 
 
to hear it, because to them, 
the word of a holy man, or the pope, is becoming a s -- a 
sacred item, and -- and whatever they say is
 right. That™s how all these problems in the 
world, through many years, without questions
 asked, had happened. Because the public 
just wanted to believe one stor
y, and not hear the other side of that story. And I™m afraid 
for that type of thinking. So 
wh en I had to speak out, and 
it™s not pleasing to others, I™m 
sorry to say that, let him tell 
them -- let him prove that I™m wrong, and it™s another story. 
But at any time my articles a
ppeared in letters to
 the editor, so on, ha
te mail came to my 
doors, with threatening, and the same way. 
And the AD L explained it to me, that because 
these people are watching those letter writers 
to the editor, and at any time, they put on 

all this here kind of paraphern alia. 
Q: Do you feel safe in this 
country, or do you feel that 
the -- this -- that
 there is the 
potential for the kind of violent anti-
Semitism that happ
ened in Europe? 
A: I feel safe, for the time being. But as I 
said, wh en you beco me, in a c -- situation like 
that, that you™re so satisfied and pleased, th
at you don™t look on th e other side, it™s very 
dangerous. So to say, or to 
foretell what might happen, firs
t of all, I™m not a prophet, 
second of all, I™m a believer. I hope the youn ger people of today make it their business to 
become participants, be of 
the political system which -- wh
at is going on, and become 
vocal. Don™t keep this story to yourself, it™s 
not a story to be hidden, it™s a story to be 
discussed in public. I™m very happy in  my  days
, that I discussed certain things on co llege 
levels, and high schools, that I spoke to 
them, and I™m always open for the invitation 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
122
 
 
 
 
when invited. As a matter of fact, I invite
d myself a few times to go in colleges where 
they teach now the Holo
caust story, which it became a part
 of the curriculum to teach, 
which I hoped that wo
uld have happened so  
many years ago, Hitler would have never 
been able to come. We see what it happens in
 Austria, with Haider
 right now. Look how 
it shook up the whole world, 
you know what I mean, just 
about letting this party come. 
So I™m very -- I feel very good that people 
get awakened  these days, by any outbursts of 
this nature. But to say that I feel safe, yes,
 but am I secured for the future what it be? I 
cannot foretell the future, I wish
 I could, and I would be able
 to answer that in another 
way.  
Q: It sounds as if you s -- you™ve always been
 very willing to talk 
about your experiences 
-- 

A: And vigilant, and vigilant -- 

Q: And vigilant, and that™s -- 

A: That was my -- 
Q: -- that™s probably  unusual, because some
 people, in the earlier years, didn™t feel 
capable of talking about that. Later on, yo
u know, gotten a distan
ce from it. When did 
you start speaking publicly 
about it? Do you have a -- 
A: From the first day of my life that I surv
ived. I couldn™t speak about it in the ire -- 
under the Iron Curtain, needless for me to sa
y, it would have been a foolish statement, 
even to make. So I will not tell you that I di
d, but as soon I got aw ay from that curtain, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
123
 
 
 
 
my  mind was open, and I spoke about it, and 
when I came to the 
USA, like I said, in 
1948, I became a participant right away 
to organizations, until I did not get my 
citizenship, I didn™t want to make public some
 of the things, because let™s just remember 
like the question you asked me before, the era 
of McCarthyism, and just think back, ™48. 
In 1948, if you were in Sovi
et Union, you were right aw
ay a question mark, you know 
what I mean? So  to tell you honestly, yes I wa s watching my self not to get caught in a 

bad web, because to defend oneself is not an 
easy situation. So, afte
r I became a citizen, I 
became vocal immediately, and with every er
a, whatever time it h appened, that I was 
speaking of. And it didn™t hurt 
me a bit that I had to disagr
ee with B™nai Brith, you know, 
because writing I did. I wrote to Mr. Foxm
an a few -- on a few occasions, and I became 
known, looks like, to some papers, that as 
soon they see my  name under the article, they 
don™t prin t it at times. And I played  a trick on
 the -- on a few of them, that I used another 
name, with my  address, and to prove my  point,
 they printed it. Which it means, it™s not so 
much that they care for the st
ory, but they  care who writes it. And I wish it would be 
good they would care for the other writers
, who write the opposite, to be watching 
themselves, but unfortunately, 
there, they™re afraid maybe th
ey can go ah ead to touch on 
the Free Speech amendment, where refusing me
 there is always ways, and how do they 
say? We cannot let you write unless six months elapsed since the lax letters today. Of 

course, I™m not a hired hand, I™m just a lette
rs to the editor write
r, you know? So , of all 
kinds of ways, that™s one of the items. I was 
told by the press, fo
r instance, from the -- 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
124
 
 
 
 
from West Palm Beach, says, ﬁYou eve -- d
on™t even  live here.ﬂ And th at was the 
publisher had that. I says, ﬁMust one live over 
there to write an lette
r to the editor?ﬂ So, 
experiencing this through th e years, I had 
the opportunity where I pass by, at one time 
writing to -- in Texas to a paper, respondi
ng on so mething. And I 
was -- was writing with 
a -- with a clergyman of high esteem, that the 
church didn™t like too well, but we found a 
certain view, something in common, whic
h it was the billing be
tween Hanukah and 
Christmas, and we corresponded quite awhile
. So to me, teaching about hopeful ways, 
about unifying people, about fre
edom loving people to be 
together, will always be a 
subject to talk about, it does not have to be N
azis, it does not have to be neo-Nazis, or any 
of the -- like that. I love to co
nverse with people, but above all, I will never sacrifice the 
freedom of demo cracy for anything else. That
™s one thing I cannot live by, or have any 
reason. 
Q: You™ve really become American. 

A: Yup. 
Q: I wanted to ask you, you 
have mentioned that your -- yo
ur store was burned down in  
1968. Will you tell me about th e -- about tha -- those events
, the riots, and how you -- 
what happened, and how y
ou perceived the issues? 
A: I can conceive in a good, 
open mind, that what had happened to  me with the riots, I 
did not pluralize ever to sa
y Black people, this, that and the other. Because in every 
situation that it happens, it™s going to be two side
s to the story. My side of that story™s a 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
125
 
 
 
 
[indecipherable]. My store did not have just
 all Black, but I would say there were two 
butch ers, which they  were white, and th e othe
r butchers, two of them were Black. The 
rest of the store, all my  employees were 
Black, from management capacity, which at that 
particular time -- so, in other words, [indeciph
erable] to the era why the riots broke out in 
Chicago, because of the killing of Martin Lu
ther King. My store should not be actually 
suffering anything like that. But this is again,
 as I told you, freedom without ju stice does 
not work, therefore, because i
nnocent people get hurt. I consid
er myself that I was not the 
party that had to get hurt, but maybe to 
say I was in the wrong neighborhood, and 
therefore I got hurt because of that. So, many 
times when I interviewed for jobs, I didn™t 

hesitate telling my  background, wh at I did, 
and th e first question would come, under the 
circumstances that you™ve been
 th rough, you obviously are 
prejudiced against Black. I 
says, ﬁNo, I am not prejudiced ag ainst Bl
ack, I™m prejudiced against wrongdoing.ﬂ I 
believe in people demonstrate for a cause. Ma
king riots and looting, is wrong. Regardless 
that I wasn™t the only one hurt, but that is not
 the way to spread an 
issue. So be that it 
happened  to  me in 1968, with that other issu
es happened to other people in other times, 
two wrongs never made one right, and that™s 
exactly what it is. While they are trying to 

wrong th e wrongs, and trying to make them ri
ght, it™s no use to follow in the fli -- same 
footsteps, to make another wrong. So, to sa
y th at I™m prejudiced, no, I do not see a Black 
person other than I see my self in
 that regard. I respect him, 
and I would always hope that 
I™ll be respected by them. I didn™t run into  an
y circumstances other than that, or because

of that, but when you go -- I went another 
time, and reopened another store, and wh en 
things began to change to the bad, when  my
 store began to  be broken into, and all of 
these here things, I saw a repetition of that
, yes, I went out. I made a going out of 
business sale, and I went away from that nei
ghborhood all together. Because I cannot be 
watching times from changing. 
Times will change whether I watch it or not. So I figured, 
it™s the wrong place for me to be, and I went out
 of there, that™s all. I became a -- an 
outdoor salesman, I co uldn™t re-establish myse
lf back in the retail business, because my 
fortune didn™t go along with me, in other 
words, at the same ti
me, I  lo st to o  mu ch , 
insurance co mp anies of that era went broke because of that, so I was just an innocen t 
victim. Yes, I feel bad that it happened. Ye
s, I can ask questions, why did it happen to 
me? Maybe to say I didn™t deserve to happ
en to me. It affects [indecipherable], it 
happened . Now, I have two ways of looking at
 it. Do I look with 
more hatred? Seems I™m 
trying to  define that I™m against hatred, so it 
would be the ca -- same thing th at I justify 
all the bad things that ever ha
ppened to me, that they are 
right. So that does not let me, 
and that™s why those interviews
 for jobs, when they ask me that question, realize that I 
can pass the test, that I am not a hate type of
 person. I was sitting next to Jesse Jackson, 

next to me at the time when 
we worked together about stopping the Nazis from marching. 
We were joining forces at that time, andI believe they, in many a -- things, what the 

Black people want to see, any other minority 
wants to see the same  way. And I hope it™s 

clarified. I heard just recently
 in New York, and the things
, what it was pulled out, with 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
127
 
 
 
 
the four policemen, please do not make riot
s, do not make break-ins, and I say Mr. 
Sharpton was right, and I was happy to  hear 
him say these words, because ideals cannot 
mix with violence. When you produce viol
ence with ideals, the ideals get lost. 
Q: We should say, just for 
the record, that you™re
 talking about the 
Amadou Diallo case 
[indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, so this is the idea 
about it. I™m a tru e believer in
 these things, even if I pay 
dearly for it, but everybody kno
ws that with -- just to speak, and one way, it happens to 
someone else, and you speak -- in other words,
 when it happens to you, it™s not wrong, 
it™s not wrong. It™s not right to be like that
, you can™t -- it™s a good saying that it goes 
around. When one™s husband -- 
when your neighbor™s husband 
is laid off from work, it™s 
a recession, but when  the husban d from this hous
e is laid off, then it™s a depression. And 
that™s the same thing, I mean, two wrongs
, no matter how many times we tried it, will 
never prove to be right. So, no, I did not re
main prejudiced due to
 the circumstances, it 
happened to me. And again, ev
en though I™m hateful to the 
Nazis, I™m not hateful to the 
Germans. As a matter of fact, last time I was 
in Israel was in June 
of 1998, and I was in 
the company near us, 40 percen
t of the gatherings at [ind
ecipherable] were Germans, 
well, they were young German people, with th
e children of the same 
-- they were the ages 
of my own children. I 
spoke to them, I didn™t feel threat
ened, I didn™t feel any animosity 
towards them. Yes, their parents, their grandpar ents were involved in
 all of that, as Mr. 
Goldhagen said, but this is my  statement. I 
can speak German to a 
young person, and be 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
128
 
 
 
 
happy to speak, and that I know how to  addre
ss them and speak. But I cannot speak to a 
person who™s older than me, or my age,
 because that -- that language that 
[indecipherable] all of this here, yelling, 
and [indecipherable] wa
s o n ly the way to 
confuse the Jews, and -- and make them -- firs
t strip them from rights, then strip them 

from anythings that they  could, be that it™
s food, and they really -- killed out th e 

intelligentsia first, so we were people that it was not enough 
left of the intelligentsia, nor 
enough left of -- in us, to be able to resist, 
an d that™s why we didn™t
 resist in as many --- 
mo re than it should have been. Besides, the 
population was not that open to  help us, but 

they would help the others, you know? Wh en  th
eir kids were taken to Germany, and they  
didn™t like it, they helped the 
partisans, because they ca -- had where to escape. But Jews, 
they didn™t. Let™s remember, th
e Germans put a price, to catch a Jew was worth a pig, an d 
to catch a partisan was worth 
a horse, if he was Jewish. So they always had a price. 

That™s how we -- the -- the 
way of killing was so glamoriz
ed that it wasn™t just the 
killing. How much they can first give him all 
kinds of punish ment, until he wish ed to be 
dead, that was the enj
oyment to kill them. But 
they -- but in the par
tisans, w h en I caught 
some Germans, to the police 
-- from the policeman [indeciphera
ble] from that time, they 
were begging fo r mercy. Please don™t kill me . And it was a case, which in my manuscript 
I described. When  we caught 
once that he was from the so
ndenfuehrer, and a girl that 
[indecipherable], he pulled out from his pocket 
pictures. He did not know wh ether we are 
Jews, or other things, and he th
ought he would show 
us pictures of Jewish girls that he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
129
 
 
 
 
has in his pocket, we do not know how these pi
ctures came to be, and why he took them 
from the Jewish girls. Because 
that was their pleasure place, 
which they would take good 
looking girls, take them in there, and us
e them, you fo llow me, sexual. So, this girl, 
seeing these pictures what he pul
led out, she says, ﬁHarold, step 
it aside, this is all mine.ﬂ 
And she didn™t [indeciphe
rable] on him, she smashed his he
ad til he was dead. So I mean, 
it™s a lot of things to understand about an era, 
be that it™s resistance, 
be trying to w-w-way 
to resist, w h ich people fail to understand what 
it was, the era at that
 time, what an era it 
was to survive. But one thi
ng I mu st comme nt over here, no matter how bad it was, the 
rate of suicides, as history will record, was 
very little. In other word
s, people just wanted 
to live, to outlive the enemy, 
no matter how miserable they 
lived, while living, it still -- it 
was very easy, you disobey, 
and you shot, and you™re dead
. Didn™t have to do any 
threatening things. If you would die -- but peopl
e no, they wanted -- that™s what it wa -- 
that was their expression of resistance, wh
ich I like to comment over here about the 
resistance. In 1983, in
 the gathering in Israel was, we
 got up about 5,000 partisans. The 
Soviet Union let out their partisans to come
 to Jerusalem to show
 in the strong -- we 
almo st mu stered almo st 5,000 people.  which 
the medal that I showed you, that I got from 
the state of Israel, is 
hanging over there. Anyways, at that 
particular time, that we got that 
together, one of the spokesman was a lady, 
a professor, her name was Kattan. The name 
Kattan in Hebrew means short, small, and sh
e was short, she was a small lady, but her 
word s were big. And she once told us, and 
she knows she™s speaking at a gathering of 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
130
 
 
 
 
freedom fighters if you want to say, or resi
ste rs. She asked the qu
estion to us, how would 
you describe yourself, what you
 did in the forest as resi
stance? One picked
 up his hand 
and he says, ﬁI killed so ma
ny Germans.ﬂ Another picked up
 his hand, and he talked 
about other things, what he did against th
e Germans. He [indecipherable] down so many 
trains. The other one was doing -- and doing 
other diversionary  wo
rk. She says, ﬁDo you 
consider all of that, what? Fighting the enem
y, or you consider that resistance?ﬂ And 
everybody came out, it™s one and [indecipherab
le]. She sa ys, ﬁNo, resistance me a n s if 
you resisted the enemy for one mo re day to  liv
e while he wants to annihilate you. For one 
mo re hour, for one mo re longer, that is resist
ance.ﬂ The wire fences round all the camps 
electrified. You could throw yourself against 
the fence any time, but few people threw 
themselves against the fences
. That in itself was resistan
ce. Be that you had a machine 
gun, that you went openly in 
warfare -- ways, to fight and re
sist the enemy, or that you 
withstand in that concentration camp, or th
at labor camp, or in the ghetto, that you 

survived an extra day to -- to
 give the enemy a loss that he didn™t win yet, that is 
resistance. I think I want to in
ject [indecipherable] in this 
conversation at the same time, 
we mu st learn, and very mu ch 
be vigilant wh en we resist ce
rtain thing in our democratic 
way, and above all, I™ll say it one more time, we must always fight for freedom, and laws 
with justice. If you don™t have justice in it, 
we just don™t have our fulfillment of freedom. 
Q: Okay, I just have a few more questions, and -- 
A: Go ah ead. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
131
 
 
 
 
Q: -- say whatever -- whatever you want. W
hose -- one question is, we -- did you ev er 
return to Australenka, or to [indecipherable] 
A: I believe, if you rememb er, I told you the st
ory, wh en  I came to Bialystok, and I met a 
friend of mine, and he told me that one retu
rned there, and got killed right away. I cannot 
return back to Poland, and see that -- the grou
nd th ere. I mu st invoke here the story of the 

14
th
 century [indecipherable] As 
we all know, the Inquisition 
[indecipherable] history of 
what it was. You -- if you wanted to become
 Christian, you had lif
e, if you didn™t want, 
they expelled you. On th
e ships of expulsion, at that part
icular time, the rabbis of the era 
who were there, with all that creation, they  created this [indeciph
erable] which a lot of 
Judaism was created. They put out sort of a 
restriction order, that forever after, no Jew 
shall dwell in Spain. To me, that evendoor 
Franco, who let the Jews
 escape in the -- the 
Nazis come to Spain, while Hitler bitterly prot
ested it, but Hitler could not afford to go 
and fight Franco, you know, for wh at he did.
 A story, I mu st tell you that story in my  
manuscript, I would like to show this, now th
at you mention, but what I wanted to bring 
out is, we did not have enough in tellectual pe
ople, even including E
lie Wiesel, who wrote 
a lot of work, and more like Elie Wiesel, that 
they did not insert that we cannot return 

back to these places of se -- 
of cemeteries. In  Judaic law we provide a saying, that you 
cannot dwell on a cemetery, just like we ar
e told with Egyptian 
people in Cairo live on 
the cemeteries, because of shortage of room. 
The cemeteries are created for dead people, 
and not fo r leef -- live people to live there.
 To us, the biggest cemeteries of the world 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
132
 
 
 
 
were left in these European countries, and 
the biggest one in Poland. Therefore, Judaic 
people are forbidden to dwell there. But we 
did not have enough of the clergy to dwell on 
that issue, and to  make it public. To peopl
e who co me back, and ev eryone who comes 
back, who didn™t live in that era, but lives in
 today™s era, and they  come back, and when  
you talk to them, they have 
only one thing to say, the an
ti-Semitism in Poland is very 
visible, and it™s very open. Even  though Isr
ael is dealing with the Polish people. Even 
though Israel is letting in Po
lish people to come to Israel, 
and ev erything else. Look, an ti-
Semitism is a disease, and no more like certain 
diseases are incurable, for the time being, 
we haven™t found a cure for that anti-Semitis
m. Should I say that 
the religion fed into 
these people is part, if not fully the declar
ation of anti-Semitism? Perhaps, maybe it™s one 
of it. But anti-Semitism, we must take it as a 
disease, an d cure as a disease, because we 
cannot say, ﬁOh, you shouldn™t 
say that,ﬂ this and that. We see -- I say we -- we see these 
thing -- people in the open, we see what th
ese people are doing, a
nd the anti-Semitism is 
still alive. So, I said I™ll tell you a little story ab
out Spain, what had happened  in that era, 
in the [indecipherable], I mentioned that story 
in my manuscript. At that particular time, 
Hitler was tremendously trying to influence 
the Spanish people, first of all that they 
should join  his armies, then help  him defeat the enemy, and ab ove all help him defeat the 

Jews. So he used to send them
 [indecipherable] there, to ma
ke speeches, and he tells the 
story about at one farm area country  over 
there, one of these emissaries came, and 
gathered them together, and trying to say 
to th em, you know we™re losing th e war, only 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
133
 
 
 
 
because of the Jews. If it woul
dn™t be for the Jews, we woul
d not ho -- have suffered all 
these losses. And all what it went bad with Ge
rmany, he [indecipherable] tried to blame it 
on the Jews. And therefore, he says, we must 
root them out, we mu
st kill them wherever 
we find th em. When he got thro ugh with hi
s speech, all these farmers, everybody had -- 
they had tools what they used fo r farming, 
grabbed them in their hands, and they went 
chasing to found Je
ws. So illusion --

Beginning Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is tape number five, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman. 
A: Even though from the 14
th
 century on, an d that we are talking about the year of the 
20
th
 century, so for 600 years, no 
Jews were in the areas there.
 To their dismay, they were 
running, and running, and they 
couldn™t find a Jew, so they 
should kill him to please the 
speakers, demand, and desire, and what he told  them to do. Even though it™s only a story, 

but again, I support what I said
 to the outset, that anti-Sem
itism is a disease. It™s not a 
because, because they di
d this, or because they did that. 
Because we found them in places 
where Jews did not even live 
there at all. So you™d say 
why -- wh -wh-why do you got -- 
want to blame them? It™s an i
nherent disease, like any other 
diseases we haven™t cured in 
the world yet, which you have 
to do, and this disease, ap parently, until now, had not been 
cured. And we must hope and st
rive to cure this disease, 
until such time will not come -- 
we™ll still have to be vigilant, and we
 will suffer with that same disease. 
Q: Okay. What are the names 
of your children, and I -- I 
was just thinking, maybe you 
could tell us something about -- abou
t your kids, and your grandkids. 
A: Okay. My oldest daughter™s 
name is Rosalie, and in Ital
y, they was a very famous 
name at the time, and we named her Rosalie. 
So Ro sa, Rosa, you find a lot of this here. 
We are very proud, and she has her name at 
t imes,  since she™s in a school, in a Hebrew 
school that she calls it Shoshanna. As a ma
tter of fact, sh e just became a grandmother, 
and she™s be -- going to be called for her gran
dchild, Safta, which is
 the Hebrew word for 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
135
 
 
 
 
granny. And that™s what she c
hose to be. So she™s very mu ch
 involved in th e educational 
field. As I aforementioned to 
you before in our conversati
on, I -- which I didn™t do with  
you on tape, that she was, after she got 
married, her husband wa
s still going to law 
school, and he graduated Geor
ge Washington Un iversity, wh
ile she took up over there, 
her Masters, at George Washington Un ivers
ity. Sh e had taken up another Masters since, 
and she™s right now studying fo r her Ph.D. Sh
e -- she was teaching at the time in -- in a 
school over there, which it was dignitaries 
children, some from ambassadors, and so on. 
And when I came to visit with
 her, there wasn™t enough wo
rds th-they -- that I her -- 
could be heard by the man who was the supe
rvisor, to tell me about my  daughter, which 
I™m very proud of. She brought 
me three children, the oldest one™s name is Jen n ifer, the 
next one, who ju st got married -- and Jennifer
 is married, and that™s
 was their first child, 
Emily. The next one was Marissa, which sh e just got married, and her husband™s name is 
Ben, and Jennifer™s husband I fe -- don™t want to forget to say, his name is Jeff. So 

therefore, my son-in-law, we call Jeffrey, or
 we call him Jeff. And my son-in-law, as I 
mentioned, is a graduate at-attorney, and he™s
 very well a part of the law. He™s involved 
in a variation of businesses, and thanks G
od he™s doing good for 
-- for his family. My 
wife, being in love with educa
tion, still is t -- like I say, w
ith the education on the school, 
and I™m happy that all the parents from the ch
ildren, like it used to be before, and the 

children, when we come visiting with he
r, we™ll go to a restaurant, oh daddy, mommy. 
This is my children from this and this grad
e, and the mommy™s -- so
 she not -- not only 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
136
 
 
 
 
knows the kids well, in a good 
way, but even  the parents of the kids. So I™m proud of it. 
Now, the youngest son of theirs 
is -- is Jordan, and he is right
 now in Texas, in college, at 
a -- Dallas, which I™m ve
ry happy and proud of 
him, too, and he looks like he™s going fo r 
busin ess in there. And my  son has two sons
, just like he was a gymnast throughout 
school, from Skokie, from Niles East, his kids
 did not follow ex actly his way, but they  
played, and we used to come 
to meet some su mmertime, to 
come to Chicago, see them 
play baseball, and they -- th
ey involved in sports, probably the youngest one likes 
basketball, what™ll hap -- be outcome. The ol
der one, Scott is his name, the younger one 
is the name Mark. My son™s wife name, Susi
e, and she is also going now for her Ph.D. 
She™s also principal in a school. So  
round and ra -- and around, I™m glad. 
Q: Thank you. 

A: And I™m very happy that education work ed
, and it was my  persuasion to the kids since 
they were little, to help th
em. I™m proud of myself th
at I could help even my 
grandchildren, not only my  kids, with -- sc
holastically, with their schools, since my 
memory, thanks God, was good, and I was alwa
ys a good studen t in school. So  that was 
the case, that I not only prev ailed with me
, of telling them, but I™m happy to see the 

fruition of them, that they™re a
ll doing good, and they ™re educat
ed very well, thanks God. 
Q: I have the impression, correct me if I™m wr
ong, th at -- that it™s been very important to 
you to carry on the Jewish tradition -- 

A: Yes. 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
137
 
 
 
 
Q: -- and I -- I wonder if -- if you -- if they 
are all -- they have had Bar Mitzvahs, Bat 
Mitzvahs [indecipherab le] 
A: You asked a very good ques
tion. I must say that my son married girl who converted to 
Judaism, she was not Jewish. And someone wo
uld listen to her on the pulpit, where my  
grandchildren had Bar Mitzvah, they would 
not think that she is not Jewish. In the 
neighborhood, she is from Skokie, you know wh
at I mean, which it was a lot of Jewish 
people. And so it work ed good. Both  of my
 -- both of their kids are recognizing th eir 
Jewishness. Both of them had Bar Mitzvahs. 
Then , of course, the oldest one is -- his 
name is Scott, is now in the un
iversity in Ohio -- in -- no, ex
cuse me, in -- let™s see, is it 
Iowa State College, taking up structural engine
ering, and we s -- cami -- we -- once in a -- 
we talk to each other, like I say. I come once a 
year at least to Chicago, so we can visit 
with each other. At times they come here. So
 depends which way, b
ecause to me, I -- I 
cannot put myself in a position 
to be away from my grandch
ildren, no more than for my 
children. So, all in all, the th
ree grandchildren of my  daughte
r, I had more closer contact, 
since they were -- the oldest one was born in Chicago, but the other two were born right 
here. So, they all know about it. My daught
er, and my son-in-law, have a good write up 
in the zig -- museum, over here in Miami Beach.
 They also involved with Jewish causes, 
they are good donors, like I am
. I gave them the example, 
as you saw in the room, which 
I have the accolades for it. We believe in Je
wish hope, we believe in Jewish future, and 
yes, being a survivor from the Holocaust, I did no
t go to blame God for 
that, as I said it to 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
138
 
 
 
 
you before, I blame man, beca
use man could have 
helped  us, and they didn™t. So  it™s no 
use to me to look for God. In -- in some peop
le™s belief, God put us on earth, and he gave 
us the wisdom to decide what
 to do. So when we
 do wrong, we can only blame ourselves, 
and not the maker. It™s the sa
me th ing like you ri -- raise a child, and you tell him the 
good things, and then  all of a sudden, the 
child goes to do a bad thing. So, sure, 
somebody would say -- the outsider would sa
y, ﬁIt™s your fault, you didn™t raise him 
well.ﬂ But you know in  your heart that you rais
ed him well, it™s just 
that it happened to  be 
that way, and you -- a
nd you probably as a parent, accepte
d that way. But you don™t go to 
blame the parent that they didn™t raise him w e
ll. And that is my total belief in that way. 
But yes, I™m very proud to  see -- we, in two 
different Judaism belongi
ng. Both of my  kids 
go to Reform, they find themse
lves more comfortable there.
 I™m a Conservative Jew, and 
I find my self comfortable where I belong, yo
u know? But I never try to interfere with 
them, I attended services in 
their synagogues, and wh atev er it is on my  side, what 
persuasion I believe should be 
a personal thing, and wh at you feel yourself comfortable 
in. 
Q: I think I™m -- I™m -- I think that™s the e
nd of my  questions for 
to day. Do you have 
anything that -- that you can think of that I 
haven™t touched -- asked you, that you™d like 
to talk about? 

A: Well, a-as I said to you 
to begin with, if I was to pr
epare with question and answers 
from you to begin with, I could make it in an  orderly way, and I would remo r less, but 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
139
 
 
 
 
since it was part from the others, and part of
 the new one, you know what I mean, and I 
didn™t put it in the order the 
way it happened, it sometimes c
ould be omitted. So, I believe 
I, at the mo ment cannot think of anything left 
out, because I believe I s -- not to praise my  
own self, but participating in so many things
, and it doesn™t matter. I was a member also 
the Holocaust Museum, while I 
was a member also to the Si
mon Wiesenthal. As far as 
my  writing, and asking like this here, I was al
ways, like I say -- I™ll n e
ver forget when the 
movie was made, from Simon Wiesenthal at th
at time, and in  that movie, it showed  a 
case, where typically, what the -- the inmate 
of a concentration camp becames pregnant -- 
do you know that mo vie, what it was, or you don™t -- or you didn™t see it, it was 
[indecipherable]. And she was pregnant by
 that comman d ing officer. And later that 
husband -- oh, the -- in -- in camp, which it was 
the boyfriend of hers, when later, after so 
many years absence, because he escaped to th
e partisans, he didn™t know about her, and 
later when he discovers her 
-- so when  he discovers wher
e she is, h e makes so many 
attemp ts, and so mehow or other, she does not
 want to s -- recognize herself. And the 
story ends that he makes a trip over ther
e, he builds with his -- sim -- with Simon 
Wiesenthal [indecipherab
le] to make the movie. And then 
he comes there, she greets him, 
and then  he takes a look at the child, and he 
sees the child s-so mu ch close -- in close 
look at him, he looks like 
the commander of that camp fro
m which he escapes. And she 
finally admits to him what had happened with
 the rest. And now she tries to tell him why 
she h -- was in hiding of that
 whole case, because how she -- 
she™s still in love with him,

and that did not happen out of love that 
she has a baby with the other. And it happened  
the case is, that she does not 
want to testify against that 
particular murderer, from that 
camp. So she tests -- testifies why, she tells 
him the story why she cannot do that, because 
take a look at it, that™s his son.
 She had -- what is to be told
 to th at child? And that child 
already was involved with so many good thi
ngs, pro-Zionism, pro-Is
rael, andeverything 
like that, while he grew up with
. So now -- so this case, and 
the [indecipherable] in other 
words, that they sort of -- 
that came the ending, without 
a conclusion. I wrote to Simon 
Wiesenthal about it, I mean, in
 -- in the -- in the -- Californi
a, and they told me, if you 
want to, you can write to Sim
on Wiesenthal your protest, wh
ich they gave me the address 
to write to him in Vienna, and everything like 
that. That was one of my things that I was 
against it of the ending of that mo vie. In ot
her word s, you ended the movie with sort of, 
what do you think? Wh at do y
ou think it was? Was she justified not to go to  answer, or 
wasn™t she not justified? And it™ll always be 
a question about it. I personally, as I say, she 
was justified to go even, she 
answered the question. He™s a 
human being, he™s a child, so 
she got impregnated by -- in a forceful wa
y, and th at should not have stop her from 

showing to be contessing ag ainst him. I op
posed it tremendously why the mov -- I was 
happy the movie was shown, but the way it 
ended, I definitely 
-- so, which I™m only 
trying to say, just talking about the Holocaus
t is not the full satisfaction. In my case, 
when something is wrong, if they do it in a 
visual way, or the other -- ﬁMax and Helen,ﬂ 
was the name of that movie, and it was -- 
and it was the movie -- you probab ly -- could 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
141
 
 
 
 
probably , maybe find about it, and that™s 
what the name, ﬁMax and Helen.ﬂ And you™d 
find it -- and basically what I told you in short,
 is what it deals. Like I say, everybody has 
their opinion, but my  opinion 
was when you put the name of
 Simon Wiesenthal on there, 
and he was -- I was -- I™m very happy with  
the man who discovered so many mu rderers, 
that they would have been dome in the ca
ses like this here. But no one is perfect, I 
suppose, in this world, and that was a goofball by Simon Wiesenthal, not that he planned 
it to work out that way. And it was a thing,
 it was done, it was over. I watched th at movie 
twice that night. I called California because it
 was three hours, so the guard, looks like, 
was the Israelite. And I spoke to  him in Hebr
ew, and he gave me even the address to 
write directly, and it -- I wrote, and I got a le
tter from them at the 
s a me ti me re s p ond ing .  
Well, it™s S imon Wiesenthal is responsible, 
he was the one producing that. So, what you 
talk to us over here [indecipherable] or 
the others, we had nothing to  do with  the 
producing it. I merely for th
e case, so that -- wanted to  tell you ab out it, because for 
always, and forever, I will remain  
involved in the cause
, or in the fight of justice, because 
this is, again, it was an unjust case. It -- let™
s surmise and to say, because she didn™t come 
to be the witness, maybe he didn™t get the 
proper punishment, or was punish ed at all. 
Now, I don™t believe that a mu rderer shoul
d be brought -- so somebody who constru -- 
who made that movie should have made that 
part be a -- sure, all of this, but it should 
have ended in a different way. It could have
 perhaps ended that her testimony was not in 
a person to person kind of way,
 but it was in a -- taking a de
position, and therefore he 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
142
 
 
 
 
was -- [indecipherable] so much 
in prison, or whatever it is. At least it would have had a 
decent ending to what it is. Do you follow me
 what I am saying? But like this here, 
because it produced a child, and for her to 
expose it to this ch ild, sooner or later, 
someday, he will know about it. Be that she w
ill tell him, or others will tell him. Max had 
the -- meanwhile, had to leave that sort of -- he
 was in love with her, 
she was in love with 
him. And that came in the disturbance, you 
understand? So that™s why th ey named the 
movie ﬁMax and Helen.ﬂ And, lik
e I say, it™s a hard taken movi
e, to see all the situation, 
what it took, until he must have
 told her that godsen came 
to see that, you know. But to 
my  case, what I™m bringing it out, is to prove
 once mo re that it™s not just one way or the 
other, I™m still -- you find th e same person all 
the way around, with 
the same o p inions. 
So, I told you ab out my  childre
n, I told you ab out my self -- about my  wife I™ll wait for 
you find out. She™s been a good
 wife to me, an d a good mo
ther to my grand -- to my 
children, and grandchildren. We ju
st celebrated in January, our 55
th
 wedding anniversary. 
Q: Congratulations. 

A: Thank you. And I -- we are 
still in love with each othe
r, which it™s a good sign. When  
our ch ildren made our 50
th
 anniversary, and -- a surprise wh
en we were in Chicago. I told 
them, you see, always, when ever you have 
arguments between husband and wife, take 
the model from us. We also had arguments, 
but never walked the 
bedroom door away, 
close it or stuff like this here, because reme
mber, it could be done, 
if you want to. We 
have a good Zionistic saying from
 -- from I n tiered sue, he said
 -- [ indecipherable] sa id it, 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062

if you been heroed -- the first proclamation, if you will want to, it will come true. And 
life is that way. When two pe
ople are married, and they want
 to stay married, they™ll be 
married. B u t if they are looking for a break 
someplace, e -- they™ll find it, you know? And 
that™s the idea about it. So I always am happy 
to say than ks God my  daughter celebrated -
- she got married in 1968 -- ™69 rather, in si --
 ™68 was the riot, she graduated from school 
in ™69. So th ey had alrea
dy 30 years of marriage, which 
it™s a good, happy occasion. So  
my  husband -- my  son and his wife are in goo
d family standing in  the same  way, even 
though he travels, and so on. 
Hardworking, both of them. Sh
e works hard in her way, and 
he works very hard in his way, he™s a direct
or in automotive, that he travels out of the 
country, and so on. But he is 
also very devoted father, and 
husband, and I am proud to -- 
to speak about it, and to say it whenever I ca
n. If you have mo re questions, ask them. I™ll 
try and an swer them. 

Q: Thank you very much, I think that™s 
-- I th ink that™s it. I appreciate it. 
A: Okay, Arwin, I must thank the museum fo
r allowing me to express what I did. I™m 
only sorry, as I said to you at 
the outset, why the volume of 
my  16 cassettes could not be 
added onto that, to ma
ke that a fuller volume, and it c
ould be somebody sitting down, and 
see in person. Because on the radio it comes out
 a different story, anybody could imitate, 
and tell it, but you gotta
 see the person, too. But I suppos
e that™s all their budget allowed 
them to do, and I will re-invigorate myself to
 become again a memb er. I already told you, 
which I don™t want to go on tape about wh at 
it is, not that it -- it™s 
any difference, but I 

 
 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062
 
 
144
 
 
 
 
believe the tape doesn ™t need to hear negative 
stories, I™m not a negative teller. S o  I™ll just 
say I™ll b -- I™ll be comi ng back a supporter of
 the Holocaust Museum
. I already told you 
the story wh at I had to go through a few times, 
with people in the kn
ow, that it should not 
criticize the mus -- Holocaust 
museums in -- no matter where 
it™s built -- being built, it™s 
our utmo st. We saw what had happened  in Ge
rmany, they want to build a museum in 
Berlin, and that™s where Holoca
ust mu seum belongs. We mu st help and support the idea 
that the people of tomorrow,
 the German people of tomo rrow, and any people of the 
world, who™ll ever come to vi
sit Berlin, they shou
ld be able to see of the bad era of 
history that it happened, because when  you hi de yourself behind, you only make that 
become a repetition, but when 
you speak about it, you educate things about it, that™s a 
preservation of not to make 
the same mistake over again. 

Q: Thank you very much. 

A: Well, thank you Arwin, for 
taking your time to come to 
my  house, and interviewing 
me, and I hope I gave you satisfa
ction I™m sure, your interview, if it mets an rating, will 
probably  meet up a good rating on your behalf. 
Q: Abso lutely. Thank you very
 much. It™ll meet up a good rating on your behalf, rather. 
A: Thank you. 
Q: Thank you.
