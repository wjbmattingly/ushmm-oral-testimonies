T he lif e stories of 
Holocaust survi vors transcend the decades.
 
W hat you areabouttohearf rom  Marty is one 
individual's account of the Holocaust.
 
W e've prepared abrief  slide presenta
tion to help with 
this introduction.
 
 
W ebegin here with this photoof  Marty taking takenf rom  1946, the year af ter his 
liberation.
 
 
Marty was born in 129in a town called Polana, in theformer country of  
Czechoslovakia, which  is highlighted here onthem
ap .
 
 
In 1939, Germ any inva ded the
 
--
 
sorry, occupied theeastern half  ofCzechoslovakia 
and Hungary the otherhalf .
 
After the German invasion of  the Soviet Union in 1941 conditions 
 

2 
 
in Marty's hom etown worsened.
 
By April of 1944, Marty and hisfam ily were 
se n t to the  
Munkacs Ghetto, which is seen here on them ap.
 
 
Five weeks af terarriving at the ghetto, Marty and hisfam ily were deported tothe 
A u sch wit z-
Bi rkenau killing center, which is located here, where they were selectedfor slave 
labor.
 
 
Later, Marty
 
and hisfam ily were sent to theMauthausen concentration cam p in 
Austria, seen here.
 
 
T his isa photo of rocks that were taken out of the quarry by sla ve laborers at the 
Mauthausen cam p.
 
 
And this lastdocument was uncovered only r ecently and in our archives, and was new 
to Marty even though this is the document that describes him  as aprisoner.
 
T hisdocument is a 
Prisoner Registration Card which ref lects Marty's transf erf rom Auschwit z on May
 
21, 1944, to 
Mauthausen.
 
His prisoner number appears here in th
e upper right
-
hand corner
, a
long with the 
words Ung
-
Jude, whic h is the 
ab
b
re v
ia t io n
 
for Hungarian Jew.
 
His nam e, circled here, also 
includeshis birthday, dateof  birth, andhis city of  birth and otherfam ily inf orm ation as wel l.
 
 
Af ter the war Marty m oved
 
to the United States where he served inthe U.S. Arm y 
during theKoreanW ar, f ollowed by a successful career in the grocery business which he 
retiredf rom  19 years ago.
 
Marty and his wif eJoan, who passed away in 2013, have two 
children andfour grandchil
dren.
 
 
Marty has been volunteering hereat them useumf or thepast 18 years.
 
And I've had 
thepleasure of knowing him  f or thepast eight or nine or so.
 
He leads toursfor local students 
andfor law enf orcement, which is the program  I run here at them useu
m.
 
He's an active 
m em be r  of  o u r  
S
peaker's Bureau
, meaning he speaks on m ilitary bases and schools across 
the country.
 
Martr y also contributed to our " Echoesof  Mem ory"  project which collects stories of  
m useum  survivor com m unity.
 
Following today's program , you wi ll be able to see Marty sign 
copiesof  thatbook in the lobby, where you cam e in.
 
 
So with all of  that, withoutany furtherado, I'd like tonow welcom e to the stageour 
F i rs t  P e rs on ,  Mr.
 
Martin W eiss.
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
A ll righ t .
 
You ready?
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Yeah.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 O k.  
W ell, Marty, thank you so muchfor being with us today and being our First 
Person.
 
There is a lot to cover but today what we're going to be looking at are sort off our big 
key m oments in your life
; s
o your lif e in Czechoslovakia before the war, af ter the Hungarian 
occupation, life inthe cam p, and thenf inally the liberationand after the war.
 
 
W e're going to jump right in.
 
Marty, tell me, tell us, about your life in Czechoslo
vakia, 
your parents, Jacob and G
o
lda and your eight siblings.
 
W hat  wa s  yo u rf am ily lif e  lik e ?  
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
W ell, m y fam ily lif e, actually, was ver y good.
 
As mentioned, we lived in 
Czechoslovakia.
 
Sometim esbecause you live in the United States, it's hard to explainabout 
Czechoslovak
ia when I was a kid in the 1930s.
 
P ri o r 
t o  W or l d  W ar  I,
 
it was the Austri
-
Hungarian Em pire so it was som ething diff erent.
 
 
By the way, one of thefew countries thathaddemocracy.
 
At a young age, under10 
years old, I rem em berwe were ver y proud.
 
And the reason we were  ver y proud was because 
next door to us was Poland.
 
They had adictator at the tim e.
 
Hungary had a very archaic 
syst e m .  
T hey didn't have a king anym ore butthey had a king representative.
 
In other words, 

3 
 
they didn'thave what I would call dem o
cra cy.  
Howe ver, you know, both of those countries, 
people were ableto live f airly norm albutthey nevertheless, didn't have what we have.
 O k?  
 
Like Sarahm entioned, I cam ef rom afam ily of nine children.
 
I was num ber seven, so I 
had older brothers and si
st e rs.  
Because Ihad older brothersand sisters, it made abig 
difference inm y lif e.
 
First of  all, we were a big fam ily and we just liked each other.
 
W e d i dn ' t  
have any problem s with each other.
 
 
Now, m y older brothers were working ver y hard.
 
By the way, m y f ather had land so we 
were f arm ing.
 
W e grew our own f ood and so on.
 
Som y brothers, as soon as they were old 
enough, they all worke d
 
--
 
we did our own plowin g, you know, thef ieldings andall of  that.
 
You 
needed sonsfor that.
 
 
W hat I  go t o u t of  i t,  bec
ausethey were older, they lookedfor words like good lif e, 
hopef ul.
 
W e were all,f rankly
 
--
 
at that age If igured
 
--
 
I had it worked up inm y own head that 
them ore educatedpeople get, the more civili zed they get, and them orepeopleare nicer.
 O k?  
Unfor
tunately I was wr ong.
 
Nevertheless, because of  them  I did have
 
--
 
to  pu t it sim p ly, 
ever ything was goin g good.
 
 
Now, in 1938, when Hitler started making noise and we kept hearing already what was 
happening in Germany
, th
ey were arresting peoplefor nothing
 
andall kinds of  stuff like this.
 
Especially the Jewish population
 
th
ey singled out.
 
 
By the way, it wasn't just Jews, actually.
 
Anybody that was not what they call an Aryan 
race.
 
T hey were ver y, ver y
 
--
 
ho w can I put it
? T
hey had a slogan that said [Spea
k i ng 
No n
-
English Language], and it was like the Germ ans were above everybody.
 
And they 
believed them.
 
By thewa y, Hungarians did exactl y the sam ething.
 
So they were ver y raci st, to 
put it sim ply.
 
It was their culture.
 
T he Czechswere not used to thatbecause we were citi zens, 
period.
 
It didn'tm atterwho you were.
 
 
So we kepthearing of all thethings that were happening.
 
They were arresting people.
 
People were running awa y.
 
Som e were sm art enough to leave.
 
Many of  them f igured it was 
going to blow over, will  have anew governm ent and so on, inGermany.
 
So many of  them  did 
not.
 
It was their hom e.
 
You have to remember, the Jews lived in Germ anyf orabout500, 600 
years prior to that.
 
So it gives you an idea that we're not newcom ers.
 
The same thing 
happened in a lot of other countries, like France and so on. 
 
 
But as time went on, in 1939, Hitler decided to go to war.
 
A nd  on e  of  t he f i
rst  co un t rie s 
he was looking at 
--
 
the Czech Republic is right next to it.
 
So he and
 
--
 
the Czechs, they had a 
spa city a beautif ul city.
 
I lived theref ora while af ter the war.
 
T hey had a lotof  Germ ans living 
there
,  qu
ite a num ber.
 
And they were all ver y successf ul.
 
They had businesses.
 
T hey had 
beautif ul houses.
 
I'm  talking about villas.
 
And they really were living on thehigh end of  wealth.
 
W hen Hitler startedm aking a m ove,he said, they're Germ an and itall shouldbelong tom e.
 
And theGermans said, yeah, we want to belong to Germ any.
 
Ju st  like  t h is.
 
They were good 
c it ize n s .
 
T hey had f
r eed o m .
 
Now they wanted Hitler.
 
 
So Hitler cam eand took the area.
 
T hat was 
t he  
f irst  st ep .
 
T henaf ter that, he kept an 
eye on the country and so on.
 
So he decided,well, if this was so easy, I'll go f or the restof  it.
 
So he took the rest of the country.
 
 
Now, what happened,Czechoslovakia was the Czech part, which isCzech 
Re p u b lic ,  
Slovakia, and [Indiscernible], whatthey called it.
 
One of the reasonsthe word rus, the 
population in our area was m ostly Russian
-
speaking.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
W as it a big town o
r sm a ll t own ?
 

4 
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
It was a small town.
 
I wouldn't even call it a village.
 
It was a good size vil l age, 
actually, but not remotely a city or anything.
 
Like I said, we lived there.
 
Everything was good.
 
W e produced our own food.
 
My f ather had a bu
sin e ss.  
 
So like I say, m y older brothers were doing all of  that work onthe business and, what 
do you call it, in thefields.
 
And as soon as we were big enough, weall contributed.
 
No w, the  
girls did their thing, too.
 
They did whatever they could.
 
You ha
ve to rem ember, we lived in a 
society we still had the black
-
top stoves, wood, brick ovens.
 
Everyth ing had to bef ed with 
wood.
 
W ehad no electricit y, by the way
,  
andwe didn't m iss it.
 
W e were used to it.
 
W e l i ve d 
lik e  t h is .
 
And everythin g was f ine.
 
 A n yw
ay
 
--
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
How old are you,about 9, 10?
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Yeah.
 
W hen we were occupied, I was 10 years old.
 
Actually 10 years old.
 
So this was all good up until then.
 
T hen when Hitler madethe move
 
--
 
what a lot of  people 
don't realize, Hitler didn't do everything alone.
 
He ' s  a llie s .
 
They call them the axi
s  of  po we r s ,  
actually. 
 
 
So what he did
 
--
 
Hungary was one of them.
 
There were others but like Hungary, Oh, 
m y God, Romania, a num ber of others.
 
Eachoneof  them  that joined, now they were 
able
 
--
 
because he gotthe country, he gave our areato Hungary.
 
So we were occupied by 
Hungary.
 
 
My f atheractually was old enough
 
--
 
he served in W orld W
ar Iunder the 
A u s t ri a
-
Hungary E
m pire.
 
T hey saidthe Hungarians are not sobad,we could live with them .
 
So ,
 
f i ne .
 
W e were a little com placent, I guess.
 
 
T he problem  was thatHungary, because they were part of the axis of  powers, they 
adopted the sam e ideas what Hitler did in Germ any.
 
T hey took away all the civil ri ghts.
 
T hey 
took away
 
--
 
in other words, they ar
rested people at ran random .
 
T hey did whatever they 
wanted to.
 
So when they cam e in, obviously we didn't like them.
 
Becauseunder Czechs our 
lif e was norm al.
 
 
Once they occupied the area, they conf iscated all the Jewish businesses.
 O k? 
T hey 
tookaway the l
icense.
 
You had tohave a license to open any business.
 
Consequently, all of  
those peopledidn't have any incom eaf ter that.
 
So it created aproblem .
 
 
T his was only in the beginning.
 
Righ t ?
 
In the beginning.
 
And as time went on they kept 
onfollowing all the ideas that Germ any established inGermany, they were doing there.
 
T h is  
was the beginning.
 
 
I remember, likeI say, I was 10 years oldand all of a sudden our whole life changed.
 
T hey closed our schools right awa y.
 
I went toCzech school.
 
T here were no other schools to go 
to .
 
But there was a Russian school.
 
Like I say, the population wasm ostly Russian.
 
W hat  
happened,by thattime, I was inf if th grade.
 
Up tofour grades I went to Czech school.
 
W e 
loved school.
 
Everythi ng was nice.
 
The teachers, by the way, were  ver y sim ilar to the United 
S ta te s.
 
N i c e  b r i gh t  r oom s .
 
It was just relaxed.
 
W eall loved school.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
W ereyou a good student?
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Yeah, I was actually a goodstudent.
 
At that time Iwas.
 
T hat changed.
 
 
So thenthey closed our
 
school andthere was no other school to goto.
 
T here was a 
Russian school.
 
W hy Russian?
 
Thepopulation was Russian.
 
They went to their own schools.
 
So the Czech was a dem ocracy.
 
So they had their own school.
 
You could have a Catholic 
school or whatever.
 

5 
 
 
T he problem  was, we went to the school
 
--
 
I spoke Russian.
 
Like Isay, our neighbors 
were Russian.
 
W here I learned Russian, I don't know.
 
As I grew up, I just knew Russian.
 
Mo s t  
likely because our neighbors were Russian.
 
So I don't remember ever having, how can I call, 
learning tim e.
 
Ju st sp oke  it .  
 
 
So we had totransfer to this Russian school.
 
Andhereour whole lif e changed.
 
First of 
all, everything was m iserable.
 
Like just picture a sunny day and allof  a sudden it's drizzl y,  
cloudy, looks m iserable.
 
Th
at's just the way you felt.
 
T he school was a com pleteoppositeof  
our school.
 
 
T here was a teacher, I rem em ber, a short guy, am ean,nasty man.
 
The m inute he 
c a m e i n
 
--
 
m ind you, Ispoke Russian butI didn't know the alphabet.
 
I didn't know anything 
about
 
that, about gramm ar, yeah.
 
I knew how to speak it.
 
T hat was no problem . He cam e into 
the class, other kids in the same class,and he didn't even give us achance to learnthe 
alphabet.
 
He expected us to carry the wholeworkload as the others without knowing the 
alphabet.
 
How can you wr ite something if  youdon't know even how to write it?
 
They have 
different letters, too.
 
You know, the sym bols,ever ything is different.
 
 
Anyway, this is the beginning.
 
Consequently, over here, by the way, they believed in 
co r
poral punishm ent.
 
So what happened, if a kid didn't know som ething, the teacher would 
t a ke  
--
 
by the way, our room s were always col d because we lived in a cold clim ate.
 
And the 
heating
 
--
 
they hada stove, usually in the corner, like abig
 
--
 
lik e  a  t ile  t
ype stove.
 
It  ga ve  of f  
som e heat.
 
You didn'tget the rest of the room .
 
T he room  was big.
 
So people were cold.
 
So  
when you sat down towrite something, you couldn't hold apencil inyour handbecause your 

f ingers were so cold.
 
This was our introduction to i
t.
 
You can im agine as a kid, youdon't like it. 
 
T hen would go to work and if  the kidsdidn't know som ething, he would take a stick, you take 

your f ingers.
 
W hen yourf ingers are cold, it'sterrible.
 
Som ebody hits you, 
b
am .
 
This is norm al.
 
A ll
 
of  a sudden you're like
 
in adiff erent world.
 
Andthis was our introduction to thisparticular 
school.
 
Som ehow or another, like I say, I used to love schoolbefore and I was very good.
 
Here, takem y word f or it, I was not.
 
You couldn't.
 
Even if  I wanted to.
 
 
A n ywa y, I 
went to the school.
 
Eventually I learned how to read andwrite and so on.
 
But ittook a while.
 
Butfor a young kid,10 years old, that'sa big deal.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
You said a lot of things were  being restricted with businesses.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Oh, yeah.
 
>
> Sarah Reza:
 
How did you havef ood?
 
Ho w
 
did you survive?
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
T hey tookaway ever ybody' s businesses.
 
Som ehow m y f ather's license they 
overlooked.
 
Don't askm e why.
 
T hey just did.
 
So we were able to stay in business.
 
However, 
what happened, bec
ause it was war
 
--
 
he was  in the meat business.
 
In orderf or you to geta 
cattlefor slaughtering, ok, you had to have
 
--
 
the state would give yo u perm issionhow m any 
cattle you could get.
 
W ell, guess what.
 
T hey lef t the licensebutthey wouldn't give us a
n y 
allotment.
 
Because we were Jews.
 O k?  
Very sim ple.So we had the license.
 
W e were ableto 
stay open but there was no way to get the product.
 
 
So guess what.
 
W e had to do things, everything during the night.
 
Now, m ind you, we 
lived in this townf orever.
W
e had neighbors.
 
W e got along no problem .
 
But because during 
wartim e you don't trust anybody.
 
Ok you really don't even trust your neighbors.
 
If you think 
they're nice neighbors, you still don'ttrust them .
 
Now, they hated Hungarians asm uch as we 
did because the Hungarians lookedat them as inf erior.
 
They don't like us because we're Jews 
but they didn't like them  because they were i nf erior.
 
Germ ans the sam e thing.
 
Everybody else, 
any Slavic people
 
--
 b
y the way, I should have m entionedthat.
 
Any Slavic peop
le, the Aryan 

6 
 
race, Germ ans, Hungarians, were so
 
--
 
they decided that they were superior and theSlavic 
people are dum b, stupid, inferior.
 
Very sim ple.
 
So this was just the way it was.
  
 
So what happens, we still had tom ake a living so we did everything d
uring the night.
 
Believe it or not, we didn't have electricity, so believe it or not, we have to do it 1:00, 2:00
 
in the 
m orning thatnobody should even notice thatwe are doing anything.
 
And we didn't have 
e le c t ric it y.
 
And that's im portant.
 
W e ha d  
candles.
 
So Ihave wouldhave two candles.
 
A nd m y 
brotherdid allof  this work by two candles.
 
W e didn't have any m odern equipm ent.
 
Everything 
was done the 
hard
 
wa y ,  o ld
-
f ashioned way.
 
W e we r e ge t t i n g b y.
 
 
In the m eantim e
 
--
 
we alwa ys had enoughfood, one thing we did.
 
My f ather was very 
good at that, at m anaging
 
--
 
we were able to grow all kinds of  cropsand everything.
 
B u t  lik e  I  
say, we worked ver y hard.
 
W e did it.
 
Som etim esm y older sisters, if they were home, they 
would help, too, whatever they could.
 
T hey would help m y m other
, a
 
lot of cooking.
 
R
em em ber, we didn'thave any gas.
 
Everythi ng had to be done m anually.
 
You have to bring in 
the water f rom  the outside.
 
All of thesethingsare very diff icult.
 
But to us it was ok because we 
were used to it.
 
 
T hi
s went on.
 
Later onm y older sister, she went to college, to the city.
 
That was 
unusual.
 
Guesshow many peoplefrom  town went to college.
 
She was the only one.
 
I shouldn't 
say that.
 
N o.
 
T here were two boys.
 
Oneof  them  was actually our neighbor.
 
He was a n
i c e 
young m an.
 
He was my sister's age.
 
And one was
 
--
 
he went on a scholarship.
 
No, wait a 
m inute.
 
They were two .
 
They went ona scholarship.
 
So there were three of them , actually.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
S he  wa s  t he  on l y gir l.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Righ t .
 
So because sh
e wasliving in the city, when she cam e hom e, shewas 
ver y sophisticated.
 
She didn't have any clothes you makeat home,like with the sewing 
m achine likem y m other used to
 se w.  
A lot ofpeople s
e w 
--
 
the girls wear
 
houseware dresses 
type al
l t h e t ime .
 
She 
cam e home she had Paris f ashion.
 
I rem em ber looking upto her.
 
Sh e  
was m ore sophisticated.
 
A nd  be c au s e of  he r I  go t t he  u r ge  t o ge t  edu c a t ed .
 
O k?
 
Because she 
had an im pact on m e.
 
 
So lif e wenton.
 
But then it was about 1942 or so, the Hungarians went to wo
rk .
 
They 
pickedup a number offam iliesf rom diff erentplaces, likef rom ourtown there were a couple of  
fam ilies, som eplace else a couple off am ilies.
 
They picked them  up without notice.
 
T hey had to 
gi ve them like a couple of hours to pack.
 
 
By the way, m ost of the people were poor.
 
They didn'thave any luggage.
 
So they 
usedpillow cases, sheets, andthey put like bundles, like you see like a peasant or som ething
 
a
ndput that stuff  together.
 
T hey put them  ontrains, like boxcars, and they shipped them out 
t o 
the Ukraine.
 
Now, by that tim e, the Germ ansoccupied Ukraineby that time.
 
They shipped 
them  out to Ukraine.
 
 
T his,too, rem em ber, our winters were ver y c old, a lotof  snow.
 
But the farther east you 
went, like Polandor Ukraine, it was muchm ore so.
 
An d
 
they would take them  to the Ukraine 
anddropthem off  in aforest someplace, where the snow is literally t his high, very, ver y deep.
 
T hey would let them  loose.
 
 
W hat they were doing
 
--
 
by that time already, I don't know if  you heard the word 
Einzatsgruppen.
 
TheEinzatsgruppen were soldiers that when the Germ an Arm y went into 
Ukraine or Russia
 
--
 
rem em ber, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia are big countries, eachone of 
t h em .
 
Now, Ukraine,especially is ver y lar ge.
 
And they alsohave a lot of f orests, a lot of 
mo
untains and so on.
 
W elived in a mountainous area.
 
They would take them  and drop them  
off  thereand wander.
 
T hey hadnofood, very poor clothingf or the weather and so on.
 
Once 

7 
 
m ore, the natives there were ver y unhospitable.
 
T hey would sick their dogs 
at
 t
hem  and soon.
 
And they would gof rom  place to place.
 
 
T he reasonI'm telling you this, som ething you're not going to read in the history 
books, unfortunately, because nobody writes about it.
 
As we kepton hearing this
 
--
 
and when 
the Germans went in, they were m erciless.
 
They went to work like in Poland, they were br utal.
 
Because they were Slavs.
 
You know, they are not people.
 
That's thewa y they looked at you. 
 
 
 
Oneof  the stories
 
--
 
we used to hear all of this.
 
A n d d on
'task me how we got the 
st o rie s.  
T hey all cam ethrough the grapevine.
 
There was no newspaper or radio or anything 
lik e  t h is .
 
T hat people escaped.
 
 
Also, which Im ight add
 
--
 
right in thebeginning they went to work and inducted all the 
m en m ilitary age, likefrom  about 20 to 50 into the Hungarian not Arm y but all the Jewish m en, 

I should say, because they hadm obilization.
 
And theother men went into the Arm y
 t
o f ight.
 
But the Jewish m en were not goodf or theArm y because politically we were undesirable.
S
o 
they putthem  intoa labor battalion.
 
 
Labor battalions were under Arm y supervision but they were not Arm y.
 
T hey wore 
civi lian clothes and so on.
 
W hat did they use them for?
 
One of the main things, cutting down 
theforestsf rom ourarea all the way to Ru
ssia .  
Mind you, to Poland
 
--
 
and I say Poland and 
Ukraine are large countries.
 
Reason I'm  telling you this, I'll tie it together later. So they wer e 
using them for that.
 
 
Howe ver, m y brotherswere sent on a Russianf ront.
 
Now, if  you want to go tohell, 
t
hat's where you went,the Russianf ront.
 
They used them for picking m inef ields and buryi ng 
the dead.
 
So thousands and thousands of  them  were stationed there.
 
And they witnessed all 
the things that were going on.
 
 
By this tim e we had already heard of the massacres, like Einzatsgruppen.
 
T roops 
were so successf ul.
 
They took Poland in three weeks.
 O k?  
Just to give you an exam ple.
 
Bu t  
otherpart, like Ukraine, a vast country, they just went in thereand Einzatsgruppenfollowed 

t h em .
 
T hey picked upall the people, village with si x f am ilies or city like Lithuania, 20,000 
people could have been there, they tookthem to af ieldand just killed them, with machine 

guns, just killedthem .
 
In som e cases they had to dig their own mass graves. 
 
 
Now, all of this was going 
on.
 
And we used tohear this.
 
Again, through the grapevine 
and plus some people returned.
 
So a lot of the witnesses I'm talking about were stationed 
there, like m y brothersand m y cousinsand so on. 
 
 
I'll get back to they wer e wandering around inthe Ukra
i ne .
 
T he Hungarians
 
--
 
by the 
wa y, you have to remem ber, they were allies so they were f ighting alongside the Germ ansbut 

the Hungarians hadtheir own section.
 
W henthey came to abridge,you have centuries under 
thefour corners of the bridge.
 
W hen these 
people came around, theHungarian troops were 
boredbecause they were sent there,and they would take
 
--
 
the stories
 
--
 
I remember stories.
 
T here was afam ily.
 
Awom an has a child inher arm s.
 
And the soldier would rip out
 
--
 
rip the 
child f rom  the m other 
and bashhis headagainst a rock.
 
Andonly then would they throw her 
into the river.
 
Andall the peoplethat were there, they threw them into the river.
 
The river wa s 
running with bodiesall day, every sin gle day.
 
It was called the Nest
os
 
Rive r.
 
>> Sarah R
eza:
 
Marty, I want toask about what happened.
 
You said your brothers were on the 
eastern f ront.
 
And then by 1944, things sort of really deteriorated, like you said, the Hungarians 
were there.
 
Let's talk about going to the Munkacs Ghetto.
 
You go ona boxca
r o r tra i n?
 

8 
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Bef ore I get to thatI just want tof inish something.
 
A s f a r  a s m y f am i l y g o e s ,  
like I say, there was nine of us.
 
My brotherswere gone.
 
So the bottom  line is, m y m other, m y 
three younger sisters died imm ediately in Auschwit z
, 
a
s soon as we got there.
 
My two older 
sisters were together.
 
Oneof  them  died in 
B el s
en
 B
ergenbut one survi ved.
  
 
Som y two brothers survi ved.
 
However, I hadonebrother, he was on the Russianf ront 
the longest,andhedoing all of  this stuff, them inef ields andall, hewas there a long tim e.
 
Andm any of  them, by the way, were able, becausethey were on the Russian f ront, able to 
either escape or werecaptured by the Russians.
 
Letm e clarif y that.
 
Andonce they got on the 
Russian side, the Russians gave them  a choice to join the Czechoslovakia legion by the way, 

by that tim e they established the Czechoslovakia legion in Russia.
 
So  m a
n y o f  
them  joined, a 
lot of them , joined the Czechoslovakia legion.
 
They came back as soldiers, including m y 
brother
-
in
-
l a w.
 
  
Butm y brother wasn't so lucky.
 
W henhe gotto the Russian side, guess what.
 
T hey 
accused him  of being a Germ an spy.
 
Once they accused you, it was gone.
 
T hat's the way the 
Russians were.
 
So they put him  into a POW  cam p f or the German prisoners.
 
He spend a
n 
extra two years af ter the war, extra two years, in a Russian prison, in the coalm ines.
 
Ca
n 
yo u
 
im agine?
 
W edidn't even know he was alive anym ore.
 
Anywa y, about two, two and ahalf  
years, we f oundouthe was alive.
 
Eventually 
h
e reconnected with my brother in the 
Czechoslovakia and they both came out to the United States.
 
I justwanted to clarif y that.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
T hat's amazing that he survived that.
 
T ell us,again, backto youand what 
happened to you.
 
So you were sent tothe ghetto. 
 
>> M a r t i n  
W eiss:  O k. 
In our case
 
--
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
Otherpeoplef rom  thetown were being sent to clear them ine
 
--
 
o r  t o t he  
Einzatsgruppen.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
No, no.
 
Just the people thatwere inducted into theservice.
 
No t  a ll t h e 
people.
 
W e were lef t at hom e.
 
W hat  
happened is af ter that
 
--
 
oh, the Germansaskedf or the 
Jewish populationearlier in the war.
 
AndtheHungarians said no, they are our citizens, can't 
have them .
 
A nd  tha t wa s it.
 
People think thatthe Germans would punish them or som ething.
 
No .
 
 
By the way, Italy, Muss olini was a fascist.
 
He did that.
 
The Italian Jews didn't go to 
A u sch wit z.  
Only af ter they tried toassassinate him and the Germantroops came in, then som e 
of  them went toAuschwit z.
 
Just to clarif y that.
 
 
But later on they asked again.
 
T h is  
tim e the Hungarians said, you want them, you can 
have them .
 
Ju st  like  t h is.
 
They went to work and roundedupover 400,000 people.
 
I 'm  ta lk in g 
aboutfam ilies, women, children.
 
In twom onths, m ind you, two months.
 
T hink
 
--
 
a b i g c o un tr y.
 
t
hink of the logisti
cs.  
They only had onetrack going f rom  our area to Auschwitz.
 
T hey needed 
m aterielf or the troops.
 
They tied itup with us.
 
In two months they shipped out over 400,000 
people.
 
T hat's how eager they were.
 
T hey announcedthey were going to pick youup.
 
The 
p
olice cam e, they arrested us.
 
T hey turned us over.
  
 
Needless to say
 
--
 
f or the sake of time, we were theref or just afew weeks, f ive weeks 
to be exact.
 
Oneday they pulledup boxcars, train with boxcars.
 
They put usona train.
 
W e 
knew already
 
--
 
we heard of the Einzatsgruppen killings.
 
 
By the way, m ore people were killed by the Einzatsgruppen than inAuschwitz itself .
 
And the reason is they had m ore time to do it.
 
And they were killing p eople ona daily basis.
 
In  
m ass graves
, s
om e 3 0, 0 0 0,  40 , 000  at  a 
c lip .
 
You can im agine.
 
Someplace maybe 300 but 
there was a lot
 
--
 
the Ukraine is loaded with thesem ass graves. 
 

9 
 
 
T hey put us on the train.
 
Now, in ourboxcar, we had 125 them  inaboxcar with the 
bundles and lots of children, lots of oldpeople, like grandparentsand so on.
 
In Europe, a 
grandparent was ver y old.
 
I'm  a grandparentbut I don'tfeel thatold.
 
ButI am  old.
 
But you see 
in Europe, it was different.Thething was, they put us inboxcars, locked thedoor,and they left 
the door a little bit open.
 
As we're going
 
--
 
we  knew we were in for big trouble becauseby now 
we heard of the massacres and killings.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
T hat's where you thought you were going, to a site
 
--
 
not aplace like 
A u sch wit z.  

>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Righ t .
 
No, no.
 
W hat ?
 
>> Sarah Rez
a:
 
You thought you were going to one of these sites they were going to dropyou 
of f .
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
W edidn't know where we were going.
 
W eknew we were in big trouble.
 
W e 
knew that.
 
They locked us in.
 
 
By the way, we wentf or several days, going along for about several days.
 
I don't even 
know what we ate.
 
One thing I remember, we didn'thave any water.
 
W e came to Poland.
 
W e 
recognized where we were.
 
W e were in Poland.
 
T hen we realizedwe were in big trouble.
 
Going east was not the best.
 
W e k ne w r i gh t  f ro m
 
the startbuteach tim e, hopeagainst hope it 
wi ll not happen.
 
W hilewe were on the train, again, we tried todecide
 
--
 
ru m o rs  s tart .
 
W ell,  
what's going to happen tous?
 
By now we knew aboutthe killings, all the realthings, but 
nobody knew about Auschwi
t z.
 
Didn't know anything about that.
 
 
W ecame to Poland.
 
And I remember the train had to stop.
 
One reason was in those 
days they used locom otives and they hadto get waterf or the locomotive because they used 

coal.
 
Anyway, so they would stop thetrain atthe station.
 
W e saw the sign like Polish city.
 
And 
we cried f or water.
 
Nobody would gi ve us a drink of  water.
 
W e were locked in there.
 
Food I 
rem em ber we probably didn'thave any, butfood you could do without.
 
But water is something 
else. 
 
 
We
 
speculated the capablepeople would work.
 
And because of thatour fam ilies were 
put in a camp.
 
Not in a country club but they will sur vi ve.
 
It's hard labor.
 
T he y w i l l  f e e d t hem .
 
W ell, this was because we were civi li zed people, this is how we were thinking
.  
Obviously that 
was a pipe dream .
 
 
Anyway, we cam eto Auschwitz.
 
W ehappened to come during thenight.
 
The m inute 
we cam e into Auschwitz, the cam p itself , they openedthe doors andthem inute they opened 

thedoors there were people running around like mad
 
m en with the striped unif orm s, directing 
you with big sticks, like broom sticks, shouting all kinds of orders in German.
 
W e understood a 
little bit but we didn't understandthe order.
 
 
Anyway, we got off the boxcar.
 
And by the way, the boxcars tomost 
of  
u
s doesn't 
seem that high.
 
But when you try to jum p, evenf or a young man, it'sa big jump down.
 
And we 
were old, like m y mother and m y sisters, young sisters.
 
It was diff icult to get down.
 
T hose 
people, we f ound out were kapos, other prisoners, but that's what they had to do.
 
If  they didn't 
do that, they were in trouble.
 
So they had toact mean but we didn't know that.
 
 
But because it was nighttime, they had aperim eter.
 
W e got off  the train.
 
You have to 
rem em ber, there were a lotof  people because it was a
 
long train.
 
I rem ember that.
 
The train, I 
rem em ber, 120 boxcars.
 
I rem em ber counting them .
 
I ' ll t e ll yo u  wh y.
 
On a curve, you couldsee 
the ends of  the trains.
 
Andas a kid, you do this.
 
You count theboxcars.
 
Sothey were long 
tra in s. 
 

10
 
 
 
As soon as we disem barked, they had the f lood lights surrounding us.
 
But more than 
that, they had soldiers with rif les, theirf inger on the trigger literally.
 
And this was our welcom e 
to Auschwitz.
 
All of  a sudden, you know, if you thought you were af raid bef ore,f orget it
. 
T hi s  
was f ear.
 
Believe me.
 
And theonly thing I could describe, if  somebody would talk abouthell, 
believe m e, hell was not asfrightening that situation was.
 
Ontop of  it, not only did the soldiers 
have theirf inger on the trigger but they had dogs, rea
l k ille r d o gs ,  t ra in e d t o  k ill.
 
T hey were  
actually held back on a leash.
 
And they were l ike growling.
 
T hey wer e ready to
 
--
 
if  they got 
ahold of a person, they would tear you apart in two m inutes.
 
This is the kind of situation it was
. 
 
You have to remember, we all were innocentpeople.
 
W enever knew violence or 
anything like this.
 
It just didn't happen.
 
And to be in this situation, believe m e, thefearof  God 
gets into you. 
 
 
You separatethemenf rom  the women im mediately.
 
W ehad to go to a line.
 A
t t h e  
f ront of the line there was an off icer with shiny boots, very sharp.
 
O ne  t h i n g ab o ut  t hem , j u st  
like a Hollywood movie star.
 
Andall he woulddo is go like this or that.
 
If  you went to the right, 
you went to work.
 
If you went tothe lef t, you went to
 
your death. 
 
 
Now, we knew
 
--
 
like I said, we all had itfigured out they wil l take care of  ourf am ily.
 
W efoundout very soon it didn't work that way.
 
So we went throughthe line.
 
Bef o r e I  go t of f  
the train
 
--
 
because thought about working 
--
 
I was not a
 
big kid, 14,alm ost 15.
 
Bu t I wa s no t 
b i g.
 
I put an extra couple of jacketson.
 
So when I wentthroughthe line,m y father and brother 
were in f ront of me.
 
They were tall.
 
And whatdo you call it, I went through and I passed.
 
I didn't 
know how lucky I was
 
that I passed.
 
Ifound out later almost all m y f riendsf rom the schooldid 
not.
O k?  
T here was actually f our others,f ive.
 
But I was the only one born in1929,all the kids 
f rom  school, that cam e back,f rom the boys.
 
The others were actually technically a year older.
 
About the same size.
 
I'm  not going tom ake a big deal out of it.
 
The only 
reason I think I made 
it is becauseI had theextra jacket because Iwas not big.
 
But this issom ething that happened.
 
W hate ve r .
 
It's what happened. 
 
 
A s so on  a s we  pa sse
d through,picked for work, they tookus to a shower, a real 
shower.
 
T hey shavedall them en, especially the grown m en, all their body hair even
, t
op to 
bottom .
 
T hey gave us the striped clothes.
 
I was lucky, I got wooden shoesbut they had a 
c o ve rin g,  lik e
 
a plasticcovering over them.
 
Ididn't realize how lucky I was.
 
Some didn't even 
get that.
 
T hey had theDutch shoes, you know, car ved f rom  wood like you see in them ovies or 
a picture.
 
Some of them  didn'thave that.
 
T hey had these clogs thatyou use at the beach like 
with the little burlap.
 
Som e had that.
 
T his is in clim ate that was always cold.
 
 
Anyway, they took us to the shower.
 
W e c am e  o ut  of  t he  s hower .
 
By that time it was 
dawn.
 
They m archedus up to the barrack.
 
T he barrack not f ar f rom  there.
 
W e c
am e to the 
barrack and allof  a sudden we saw, like we s ay
,  
it was dayli ght, we saw these big chim neys 
around, alm ost like a circle, f ive or six chim neys.
 
W ef ound out they were called crematorium s.
 
W enever heard of a crem atorium .
 
T hat's what they were doing with the bodies.
 
W e found that 
out very quickl y.
 
 
But then they wouldn't let us intoour barrack.
 
W eha d t o  st a nd  ou t s ide .
 
L ike I sa y, it 
was cold.
 
Thefunniestthing is, the spring of the year but it was m iserable.
 
It wasn't rainingbut 
it  wa s  d ri z zle
,  ve r y g r a y.
 
W i t h h i nd s i gh t
 
--
 
later on, I remember
 
--
 
we hadto stand outside.
 
I t 
was so cold.
 
W e wereshivering because theclothes were very thin.
 
15,20of  us would get 
together in ahuddle just to keep our body warm , our teeth were rattling.
 
 
W e  s a w t
he chim neys.
 
W efoundout what the chimneys were.
 
Of  course you could 
sm ell the sm oke, literally like f lesh burning.
 
And then notf ar,afew hundred yards away, there 

11
 
 
was this big ditch, almost the length of afootballf ield
a
nd the pine trees.
 
But under the pine 
trees there was af ire, like the whole ditch was af lam e,f lam es going up the height of thepine 
trees.
 
Again, we asked one of  the kapos what that is.
 
He  loo ks at  u s.
 
He says, the transfer last 
night up inf lam es.
 
The crem atorium s were so overloaded, they couldn't handle the volume.
 
So  
they used these pits to burn the rest of the bodies.
 
T hose are your f am ilies.
 
Ju st like  t ha t .
 
That 
was thef irst morning in Auschwit z.
 
 
Believe m e, if  nothingsobers you up, that does.
 
Once you see that, you just
 
--
 I  
rem em ber, you know, I was ver y young, and I rem em ber
 
--
 
I don't know what happened.
 
I ju st 
rem em ber that we wer e all
 
--
 
nobody spoke about it.
 
W enever spoke about it to each other, 
nothing.
 
W e never mentioned it to each other.
 
 
Anyway, Auschwit z.
 
About 
eight or 10 days.
 
T hey put us on a trainagain.
 
T his tim e, 
believe it or not,only 50 in a train.
 
But we had two guards inside.
 
W hy they needed two guards 
because we were locked in there anyway, but we had to sit likethis, crossed
-
legged, in one 
position 
in rows.
 
And we were notallowed to whisper, not allowed to m ove, notallowed todo 
anything.
 
 
T hef unny thing is, years later I rem em ber thinking, I don't rem em ber getting any f ood 
or water.
 
I don't rem em berany of  that.
 
Isn't that funny?
 
If  we did, Iwould have rem embered.
 
B u t  I d on ' t  r em em ber .
 
Obviously we didn't
. 
 
T his tim e we were goin g westward.
 
T he reason we knew where we were going is 
because we cam e to Austria and the train stopped on abridge.
 
W e saw Vienna not far off.
 
Could tell f rom  pictures, 
probably, that it was Vienna, thearchitecture and so on.
 
W e stopped 
therefor a while.
 
 
T hen later on, we didn't know what was going to happen tous.
 
But thenthe train 
startedagain and we cam e toourdestination.
 
Now, we cam e to our destination and we 
d
isembarked.
 
W e found out, oh, alongside a huge, huge mountain.
 
It turned out it was a stone 
qu a rry.
 
It was a big, big m ountain.
 
And the cam p was built on top of the stone quarry.
 
So on 
top of  the m ountain.
 
They m arched us up down the road tothe topof  the
 
c am p.
 
W e c am e t o  
the camp.
 
Like I say, it was a stone quarry.
 
Everything there Mauthausen was builtf rom a 
stone quarry.
 
T hetowers, the gate
 
--
 
not like som e of the camps but this one had towers that 
looked likef rom  an old m ovie,f rom  the1500,1600 Eng
land.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
Like a Medieval castle.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Righ t .
 
Plus they had abig, big gate, high gate.
 
And the stone,all the walls  
were built outof  stone from  the quarry.
 
W ef oundout later Mauthausen was a huge, huge 
c a m p.
 
It was so big they also hada lot of  subcam ps.
 
I knew about 40.
 
Lately them useum does 
research, they f ound as m any as 80 or 90.
 
I knew about 40 atone tim e.
 
 
T he point is,they marched us up to the cam p.
 
W e came into the camp.
 
A nd  a ga i n,  
here, opposite f rom Auschwit z, we were 
on top of the mountain.
 
It wa s h ot.
 
And I mean hot.
 
T he  s un
 
--
 
it was on top of the mountain so itgets hotte
r.  
T he  s u
n was sobright that I 
r e m em be r .
 
 W
ehad to stand outside all day.
 
At night we had to go in thebarracks.
 
And guess how 
we slept in the 
ba rra cks.  
Som ething you would only see in am ovie.
 
T he y
 
--
 
the barracks were 
like an Arm y barrack.
 
You would go in
 
--
 
stand outside in the sun allday.
 
T he sun was so 
strong I got an eye infection thef irstfew days.
  
 
Andby the way, throughout the whole 
time  I wa s i
n  c am p,  I h a d a n eye  i
nf ection.
 
Ever y m orning I got up, I had to take10m inutes just to get the stuffout of m y eyes so I could 

12
 
 
open m y eyes.
 
I 
couldn't even open m y eyes.
 
It tookabout two, three years af terthe war to get 
rid  of  it .
 
Th a t 's  h
ow infected I had.
 
 
Anyway, we walked into the barracks.
 
Inormally don't mention it for the sakeof  tim e.
 
T hey lined up mattresses on both sides of the barrack.
 
W hen they blew a whistle, you had to 
run in, I mean run, over the steps to get into the thing,
 
line up in rows like this in goodfashion, 
on each side of them attress.
 
Somebody woul d blow a whistle.
 
You had to f all down.
 
One head 
this way, thef eet thatway and the opposite.
 
So we were layin g like sardines.
 
You had 
som ebody else'sf eet in your face
 
and Ihad som ebody else's
 
--
 
somebody else hadm ine.
Ju st  
the way it was
,  ju
st like sardines.
 
T his is the way it was.
 
 
An d
 
here's the
 
irony of the wholething.
 
In the m orning, again, blew the whistle.
 
W e 
had to be out.
 
If  you were too slow, somebody would
 
sm ack you with a stick at thedoor.
 
W e 
hadto stand againoutside all day.
 
Andthis is the way it was.
 
W henyou go through this 
process, you say to yourself, what kind of  world, what kindof people
 
--
 
who are these people 
thatthey could do this?
 
W ho even
 
thought of doing it?
 
B u tth at is the  wa y it wa s. 
 
 
I didn't stay in Mauthausentoo long.
 
Mauthausen, like I said, was very big.
 
T hey had a 
lot of  subcamps.
 
I wassent to a cam p called Melk.
 
The irony of  it isagain, Melk, a beautiful, 
beautif ul town.
 
I 'm  
telling you, just picture postcard town.
 
I ' ll te ll yo u  wh y.
 
T he Danube runs 
right through it.
 
T he reasonI rem em ber seeing it
, e
ver y day we went to work
 
--
 
by the way, the 
work we did, m ost of us worked on tunnels, building tunnels under this huge mountain.
 
W hen 
you passed through town, you could see across the Danubethere was am ountain with trees 
a n d  stuff.
 
T here were m onasteries, castles.
 
I 'm  te lli
ng you, picture 
postcard.
 
Today, by the 
wa y, if  som ebody takes a trip on the Danube, they passthat.
 
 
T his is what you saw.
 
You said to yourself , and we are herem arching like this
?  
Ou r  
job was to dig atunnel, tunnels, seven tunnels sim ultaneously.
 
T h a t ' s wh y t
he cam p was there.
 
T hey built a special threshold onaf ield but itwas high above the ground.
 
T ra in  t ra cks.
 
W e 
went to the train,m arched every day.
 
W e went to work by train.
 
Again, we hadto stand out 
there when it was cold, windy.
 
T hat wind goes right through you, believe it or not.
 
Just to stand 
out there.
 
But you had to stand at attention.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
Marty, I don't want to cut you off but we're running out of time.
 
I know there's a 
story you want to tell about liberation
 a
nd what happened there.
 
So
 
I want you to
 
--
 
so you 
were in Mauthausen, building the tunnels.
 
Then what happened?
 
Talk us through liberation.
 
T he Russians areadvancing.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
Brief ly, yeah.
 
By the way, m y f ather was in the sam e camp.
 
However, I 
hardly saw him .
 
He was onone sideof  the cam pand I was onthe other.
 
He died there.
 
Yo u  
were old anywa y.
 
People say do youhave f riends?
 
W e hadf riendsbut they were alwa ys gone.
 
You didn't have anybody that you were really
 
f riends, f riends with.
 
You were not long enough 
together
. 
 
T he Russians were inHungary.
 
W e heard they were in Hungary and the Am ericans 
were com ing inf rom  the west.
 
So they shipped usback to Mauthausen.
 
I can't give you too 
m u c h d et a i l  of  t he  oth er  s t uf f .
 
Butthey shipped usback to Mauthausen.
 
 
A s so on  a s 
we cam eto Mauthausen, thef irst thing they did
 
--
 
by the wa y, Melk, all 
m ixed population.
 
I'm talking ever y country had representation justabout inEurope.
 
There 
were Ukrainians, Russians, Pols, Greeks, Italians, younam e it.
 
T hey were represented.
 
B u t a
s 
soonas we came to Mauthausen, guess what.
 
And by the way, we didn'thave any markings 
we were Jewish or anything like that.
 
W e justhadm arking if  you were politicalor dida crime 

13
 
 
like m urder, rape, robbery, whatever.
 
T here were people like this.
 
A ct u a
lly, m ostof  them  were 
Germ an.
 
Yeah, therewere Germ ans, too, Iforgot tom ention.
 
 
Anyway.
 
W e cam eback to Mauthausen.
 
Andthef irstthing they did,as soon as they 
cam e to Mauthausen,forfirst tim e you were singled outas Jews.
 
T hey took usout of the 
c
a m p.
 
T hey took us tothe side of them ountain.
 
And the side of them ountain, there was 
nothing wrong with it but it was outside the cam p itself .
 
T he area was ver y unhospitable.
 
There 
were thorn bushes, barely a piece of grass you could lay down in orwhate
ve r .
 
 
By that tim e,by the way
 
--
 
b y the way, thef ood was always a problem .
W
e were 
alwa ys starved, nothungr y, starved.
 
Butby now, believe m e, we got nothing.
 
Again, because 
of  time I can't give you the details.
 
If  you had 150
 
calories a day, believe m e, it was a lot.
 
W efigured, ok, now they're going to kill us.
 
W hy would they separate us?
 
W hy would they do 
that?
 
Here they could just take them achine guns and gun usdown.
 
T ha t's it.
 
 
So we were resigned this is it.
 
W e never, never expected them to let us out alive, let's 
put itthis way.
 
Because then we could tell the world what happened.
 
At least that's what we 
f igured.
 
So we were re signed to it.
 
 
Guess what.
 
W e were there for a certain amount of  tim e.
 
I don't remem ber exactly 
how long.
 
It couldn't hav
e beentoo long.
 
By that time people weref alling down, just plain, you 
know, lookedmore like the walking dead than hum an beings.
 
Guess what.
 
One day they com e 
out, we are going on am arch.
 
Later they coined it Death March orforced march, whatever.
 
In ste
adof  killing us, now we were surprised they didn't kill us.
 
W hythey m arch us som eplace 
else? So we startedmarching.
 
Most of the tim e we marched on country roads.
 
W e m arched 
f rom  Mauthausen to 
--
 y
ou have to rem em ber, again, thefood was a big thing.
 
Hunger is the 
ver y thing that possesses you.
 
You can't think of  anything else.
 
 
As we were m arching, m any people would just trip, trippedthem selves, and theyf ell 
down or something and they couldn't get up.
 
T he guard wouldpickup his rif leand shootthem
 
right there on the spot.
 
Just like that.
 
O ne
 
--
 
as we were walking, there was one tim etherewas 
a f ellow right near m e.
 
He saw a potato onthe ground.
 
He jum ped for the potato.
 
Another 
fellow f rom  the other side saw the sam epotato.
 
He jum pedfor it asw
e ll.
 
Guess what.
 
T h e y 
startedf ighting over the potato.
 
O k?
 
Guess what.
 
Again, the guardwas like as close as she is 
to  m e , p
ickeduphis rif le, shot onethere right in thef ace.
 
Just like that.
 
 
Now, even seeing what I did, andbeing usedto violence like
 
this, but when you see a 
m an do this,I don't care if you're Germ an, what.
 
He was an ordinary m an.
 
He was not SS.
 
He  
was just ordinary Arm y, regular Arm y.
 
And they were not supposed to be thatbad.
 
I could 
never understand what the heck
 
--
 
who his parents
 
were.
 
I don't care how m uch of a Nazi he 
wa s .
 
 
Anyway, we cam eto our destination.
 
T his time it was a new cam p that we came to 
called Gunskirchen.
 
And there there was thousands of peoplethere.
 
But guess what.
 
On ly  f ive  
b a rra cks.  
Youhad to stand, again, outsideall day, atnight into the barrack.
 
God f orbid you 
should stick your headout.
 
You would be shot. 
 
 
W e go  i n.
 
5,000
 
men in abarrackfor the night.
 
Guesshow we spent the night.
 
Standing up like sardines, upright sardines.
 
And this is the way you spend your night.
 
I  wa s  
younger and I was able to crouchdown a little bit.
 
I was ableto spend the night crouched.
 
T ha t  
was a little easier.
 
This was our experience in 
Gunskirchen.
 
Peoplewere in ver y, ver y bad 
shape.
 
 
Guess what happened.
 
Mind you, 14,000, 15,000 people there.
 
As soonas I came to 
Gunskirchen, I run into a cousin of m ine thatwas in Hungary, in theHungarian labor 
battalion.
 

14
 
 
Again, they were such bastards.
 
T hey took those people, instead ofleaving them  there, the 
Russians were there
 
already, and just gohome, runhom e, they didn't.
 
T hey evacuated them , 
brought them  into Austria, turned them  over to the Nazis, and they put them in this cam p.
 
I ran 
into m y cousin.
 
 O
ddly enough, in MelkI was with his brother.
 
W hen we shipped out, his 
brother went 
to adiff erent camp.
 
I went to this cam p.
 
Hisbrother was there.
 
He was about 22 or so years 
old.
 
He had two other buddies.
 
How in the world If ound him , I don't know.
 
Outof  so many 
people.
 
T hat was a 
b
ig lif t  f o r m e .
 
By this time, by the way, I was a basket case.
 
Though som e 
people were worse, obviousl y.
 
I team ed up wi th them.
 
It gave m ea certain lif t.
 
Because they 
were in pretty good shape compared to us.
 
They had it bad but nothing what we had.
 
 
T hen we went to work.
 
W e heard one day guard
s  h ad  l ef t .
 
Atf irst we didn't believe it.
 
Many people did walk out.
 
W efigured out it was going to be atrap, you go out the gates, they'll 
have m achine guns waiting to mow us down.
 
T h is wa s the ir M.O.
 
Righ t ?
 
So we decided to 
spend the extra night starving in this place.
 
W e didnot leave until thef ollowing day.
 
T he  
following day we reali zed, ok, it's true.
 
 
W edidn't seeAmericans, by the way.
W
e walked out to thehighway and we saw 
Am erican troops there with the tanks, the jeeps, m y God.
 
It wa s a  
beautif ul, sunny day.
 
Beautif ul!
 
It was like rebirth.
 
But we were so hungry.
 
So we went into af ield.
 
W e found an 
abandoned train, Arm y train.
 
It had a bunchof canned goods inthere.
 
Theproblem  is we didn't 
have anything toopenthem  with.
 
So we got som e
 
cans, som ef ood,so you have to have it.
 
It 
wa s  lik e  li ve r
wu r s t
, spam , that kindof  stuff.
 
 
By the way
,  
that would have killed us if we ate it.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
Yeah, if  you had nothing.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
E xa ct l y.
 
In them eantim e, we saw this truck ina ditch, in thef ield.
 
W e s aw 
this truck ina di
t ch
.  
W e went to investigate what was in it.
 
Guess what.
 
W e found a tub of  lard 
on thef ront seat.
 
Just plain lard.
 
And I said to theother guy I was wit h
 
--
 
they were like 20,23 
years old.
 
O ne  of  t he  gu ys
 
--
 
they
 
were still in good shape
 
--
 h
e tookhisf ist right through the 
glass, the window, the door window.
 
All the glassf ell into the lard.
 
Ok ?
 
T his is a real story.
 
So we tookthe lard, scooped itout, cleaned it up.
 
W esaved the lard.
 
W e were about to walk 
a wa
y and oneof  the guys says, let's look in the back of the truck.
 
W e go tothe back of the 
truck, clim b up there, and we struck gold.
 
W hat did we f ind?
 
W ef ind leather hides all ref ined 
already for use.
 
W e got really excited.
 
W h y?
 
W eknew for love or money,
 
not that we had 
either one, but shoes.
 
Now Europe, believe or not, shoemakers stillknew how to m ake shoes 
f rom  s c ra t ch .
 
W hen I was a kid, we had bootsm ade by the Shoem aker.
 
So we were all 
excited.
 
I couldn't carry toom uch.
 
I remem ber I was lucky I walk
ed.
 
But eachone of us rolled 
up af ew of  thehides.
 
W e were very, ver y excited about it.
 
 
In
 
them eantim e, we saw a farm house notf ar away.
 
W e reached the farmhouse.
 
One 
thing I will stress to you, m ention,I had suchhatred tome every Germ an was a Nazi and ever y 
Nazi was a Germ an.
 
And if  somebody said here's apistol, shoot som ebody, I rem em ber 
feeling like I had such rage, such hate, such rage, that I could havedone it.
 
But here's what 
happened af ter.
 
W e cam e to the house.
 
W e knocked on the door.
 
W e didn't barge in.
 
And a 
lady com es to the door.
 
And she opensthe door justa littlebit.
 
Sheaskedone of the guys 
what we want.
 
All I saw was her
 
face.
 
They were taller thanI was, inf ront of me.
 
So  tha t's 
a ll I  
saw of  her.
 
Oneof  theguys asked her to give  us som eeggs, f lour and water.
 
She went back in 
the kitchen, brought it to the door and gave it to us.
 
W e never entered her door.
 

15
 
 
 
Af ter I started speaking, it tookfour,f ive years bring rem em beredthis.
 
N o w I  al wa y s  
like to include it inm y closing.
 
We
 
took the ingredients.
 
W edidn't go intoher kitchen to cook 
thedarn stuff , m ix it up and cook it.
 
W hy
 
I don't know.
 
But you know what we did?
 
O n e of  t he  
guys sa ys there was abarn inthe backyard.
 
In thef ront was one ofthose iron kettles they 
used to h
eat up waterfor the cows.
 
T hey woul d throw sometimes
 
stale bread, warm m ilk, 
whatever.
 
W e m ade a f ire.
 
W eput som e water in there.
 
One of the guys m ixed the ingredients 
and m ade dum plings.
 
T hat was the easiest thing tom ake.
 
T hat's why we usedthe lard.
 A
nd 
the other ingredients. 
 
 
Again, som etim es youget a sixth sense you know what to do without knowing.
 
I had 
about three or f our of  them.
 
W hen you're hungr y, I m ustem phasize, if  somebody gave you  
f i ve
-
pound loaf of  bread, you don't want to leave it.
 
You 
want toeatthe whole thing.
 
You donâ„¢t 
want to leave itfor later.
 
You got like an animal, just want to eat thewhole thing.
 
But som ehow, 
som ething told me after four or so I stopped.
 
T he reasonI point itout, there were thousands of  
people, when theAmericans started giving th em  food or theBritish,f rom our cam p alone, 

5,000,6,000 died thefirst week or two bef orethey realized what took place.
 
Anywa y, one of 
the guys had anuncle.
 
He was older, around50.
 
T hat was considered old.
 
Not too many 
50
-
year
-
olds.
 
He ate too muchand died the day or two later.
 
So it just shows you.
 
 
Anyway, here's the clincher.
 
After we f inishedeating.
 
Rem em ber, we're ver y content.
 
Oh , m y Go d .
 
Thef irsttim e you ate something like a humanbeing.
 
Besides we were ver y 
hungry.
 A
s  we  f in is h
ed, one of the guys said,you know som ething, each oneof us should take 
som e of the hide and give it to the lady.
 
And what bothered m e
 
--
 
I'm  telling you, forf our, five 
years bring rem embered this, but I remembered it.
 
It bothered m e.
 
W hat t he
 
heck is wrong with 
m e?
 
How com eI didn't object?
 
Give me abreak!
 
Im ean, she was Germ an.
 
I hated her.
 
A nd  
we never did anything to her.
 
He says let'seach give som e of the hide to take to the wom an.
 
W e contributed, each one, gave som e of the hides.
 
Knock
edonthedoor and gave it to her 
and said thank you. 
 
  
T he  
reasonI rem em bered it 
--
 
I go t s
o madat m yself .
 
How com e I didn't object?
 
T hey 
didn't go through whatwe did.
 
Don't getm e wrong.
 
They didn't have it good but nothing 
com pared to what I did.
 
So
 
till this day I never figured it out.
 
But what really got m e, I was really 
m ad at m yself .
 
T hen I thoughta coupleof things.
 
T h at  
I 
learned to live with.
 
T he way we we re 
raised,
 Jud a ic 
valuesand the way our fam ilies raised us, number one
;  
num ber two, in spite the 
dehumanized
 
--
 
we didn'tf eel like humans, we still acted like hum an beings.
 
 
I'll stop there.
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
T hank you, Marty.
 
T hank you so much. 
 
>> 
[Applause]
 
 
>> Sarah Reza:T hank you all som uchf or joining us today.
 
Unf ortunately we' ve gone over so 
we don't have tim efor questions.
 
I do want you to stay seatedfor am om ent.
 
In a second,our 
photographer, Joel, will com e up and we'll doa photo with you all in the audience.
 
So with 
Marty f acing this way.
 
So just to hang tight for one m ore
 
second. 
 
 
F i rs t  P e rs on

You can

And before Iturnback toMarty to have the lastword, 
unless you want thatto be your last word which was pretty powerf ul,Marty wil l be out in the 

lobby of  the theater just af ter this to sign books.
 
You can askhim  your questionsthen.
 
You can 
shakehis hand, take a photo.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
If anyone wantsto talk to me outside, gladly. 
 

16
 
 
>> Sarah Reza:
 
W e'll be outside.
 
We
 
will be exiting through that door and thenm eet everyone 
up there.
 
 
Ma rt y,
 
yo u
 
dohave the last word if  you want it.
 
W hen you'redone, Joel
 
will 
com e up 
andtake the photo.
 
>> M a r t i n  W ei s s :
 
My last word will be ver y si mple.
 
Don't be a bystander.
 
W hen  so m e
one's 
house is onf ire, what do you do?
 
You try tosave ever ybody.
 
Righ t ?
 
But you call thef ire 
department.
 
The same thing, if  som ebody happens to som ebody, aneighbor or somebody 
does something, it could be the governm ent or som ebody, don't justlet it go
 
and say, well, i t 
has nothing to do with m e
, w
hich m any people did.
 
Italways has som ething to do with you.
 
Because Ithink we are hum an beings and we should care.
 
 
I always tell
 
--
 
I speak to school kids a lot or college, whatever.
 
I always tell them  on
e 
thing.
 
If  somebody doesn't like you because of  your religion or where you camef rom or 
whatever, chancesare hedoesn't like somebody else if  he's next tosom ebody else.
 
People 
like this have a disease.
 
And they think that there's obviously som ething wrong with som ebody 
else but I'm  perf ect.
 
In other words
 
--
 
but most of all, you have to have the values of ahuman 
being rather than because som ebody else ism ean you have tobem ean, too.
 
If  you teach your 
children like this, Ithink we're in good shape.
 
 B
y the way, I will brag about the children.
 
I've spoken to schoolsm any, m any places, 
whether North Carolina, Utah or inbetween.
 
Ever y single tim e I went, I always com e back 
feeling good.
 
My experience isusually 100%.
 
You know wh y?
 
I never see it with the
 kid s.  
It  
couldbem ixed kids, variety of  kidsf rom  different places,diff erent color, different
 
--
 
I've never, 
never seenany problem  with it.
 
T hey all seem  to be
 
--
 
so thattellsus a lot.
 
W e could learn 
f r om  th em .
 
 
And there are so many people todayf or the slightest reason they still
 
--
 
I th ou gh t tha t 
was already f orgotten, old hat.
 
Butpeopleare still that way and that's notnice.
 
Especially i n 
the United States
, w
e could do better.
 
 
T hat'sm y last word.
 
I think we should all try to be better.
 
>> S a r
ah Reza:
 
T hank you.
 
>> 
[Applause]
