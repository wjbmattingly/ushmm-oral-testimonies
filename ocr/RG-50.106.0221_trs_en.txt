Q: Okay .

Q: All right.  Now, let's talk about that.

A: Well, I was sent to Camp  Croft, South

center.  And maybe I didn't  speak up enou
gh about what ŠŠ my  background, because 
besides having a history background, I t
ook one public administration course.

A: And took the junior professional assi
stance, that is a U.S. exam, in public 
administration and got a very high grad e.

course.  And I had also applied for the 
?RŠtech? exam, which I never took because I 
was in service.
 
Q: Right.  UmŠhum. So, you'r

A: At Camp  Croft, South Caro lina.
  I was trained in the infantry.
 
Q: Okay.  All right.  And 
th en  yo u  stay ed  th ere Š Š
 
A: And from there, at the e
nd of training ŠŠ I think it was in June, it was a threeŠ
month training period.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: February, March, April, Ma
y ŠŠ I think the beginning of 
June, a group of us, a train 
load of us, was sent to Camp  Pendleton, Virgin ia.
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: Which is just south of Virgin ia Beach.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And were assigned to the 111th Infantry.
 
Q: UmŠhum.

Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: And it was a combat team, stretched out along the coast.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: It's headQ:uarters were Fort Monroe.  
One battalion was at ŠŠ near Fort Story ŠŠ 
no.  One battalion was at a camp called Camp Thalia, and later Camp Ashby, between 
Virginia and ŠŠ Virgin
ia Beach and No rfolk.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And this battalion was stretched out over 
the coast of Virginia.  Another battalion was 

along the coast of North Carolina.  And I wa
s lucky, so me of us were lucky who were 
from New York , and we were assigned to  
a battalion at a place called Westover, 
Maryland.  That's  ŠŠ you know, are you acQ:
uainted with the with area Salisbury, 
 
Maryland?  
 
Q: A little bit, a little bit.
 
A: Well, it's twenty miles below Salisbury, Maryland.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 

A: And it was stretch ed ŠŠ there were three re
giments, three infant
ry companies.  One 
company stayed at headQ:uarters at We
stover.  One was at Berlin, Maryland.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And they protected the area aroun
d Ocean City and Ch inco teague.  
 
Q: They were concerned about th
e coast is what you're saying.  
 
A: Yeah.  It was the Coast Defense Team on combat duty.
 
Q: Oh, okay.
 
A: We didn't comb at, but we were armed to
 the tee, in case something happened along 
the coast.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: And another company was at ŠŠ company was kept at ŠŠ at a place six miles 
above Cape Charles.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Place called Oyster, Virginia.
 
Q: So you ŠŠ but you stayed  
in your place for how long?
 
A: I was at ŠŠ first, I was in the heavy we
apons company.  I wa
s in the machine gun 
platoon, heavy machine gun platoon.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And I was in it for about three or four months.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And I asked the comp any co mmander, I said ŠŠ I said I'd like to go to 
headQ:uarters comp any, become a radioman.  
The reason I wanted to be a radioman, I 
figured it would give me mo re time to be free.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: To do reading.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  Okay.
 
A: And he liked me very mu ch, and he gave it 
to me.  and then he was assigned to form a 
cannon comp any, an d he wanted  
me to be his comp any clerk.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: In fact, while I was in the company, he 
looked at my  record, and he had me give his 
orientation lectures that 
were historical, usually.
 

Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: But I went to head Q:uarters comp any, an
d I was there for ŠŠ when I got there, they 
wanted me to be a scout.  I said, "Look, I cam
e here to be a radioman."  So, I went to 
radio school.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: At the first radio school I went to wa
s me chanics radio school in Washington D.C.
 
Q: Oh, okay.
 
A: And that was three months.  And it was really a good deal.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Because some of the fellows went out
 to Kansas and some went to Altoona, 
Pennsylv ania.  And Washington D.C. was ea
sy to get to New Yo
rk on the railroad.
 
Q: Right.  Right.  
 
A: So, I was lucky there.
 
Q: Then after that, what did you do?
 
A: I came b ack to the comp
any, and I was a radioman.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: I operated at headQ:uarters for a while, and 
then  they sent me out
 to Oyster, Virginia, 
with two other fellows.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: To operate the radio in a command car.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And that was a good deal because we were our own bosses.
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And we had a command 
car, and we drove around 
many times.  We had free 
time.  We had to charge the battery.  
And it was free ŠŠ we were our own bosses.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum. 
 
A: And then  my  regiment was alerted.  An
d they took some of us ŠŠ we had no choice 
in it ŠŠ sending ŠŠ some of us were ta
ken and sent to Fort Monroe, to the 
Chesapeake Bay sector signal operations ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: ŠŠ unit.
 

Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And from there, three of us went to the 
outfit that replaced th
e 111th Infantry, 101st 
Cavalry of New Yo rk.  And it was at Camp  
Ashby, or Thalia, it's  original name.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I did radio operating there ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: ŠŠ for a number of months, I think.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: From ŠŠ trying to think, I th
ink fo r about three or four months.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then, this group, three fellows ŠŠ 
another radioman and I and one wireman Š
Š
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: ŠŠ suddenly got orders to repor
t to Camp Ritchie, Maryland.
 
Q: Okay .  That's  what I'
d like to talk about now.
 
A: We didn't know anything ab out Camp  R
itchie.  We didn't know what it was.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.

  And we went ŠŠ to ok us a couple of 
days to get to Camp Ritchie.

 the 2nd Mobile Radio 
Broadcasting Co mp any.  
 
Q: Okay .  Had you heard of Camp  Ritchie before?
 
A: Never heard of Camp  Ritchie before.

A: In fact, one of the fellows was 
a fellow by the name of Rudy Brooks.
 

Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: He was a radioman.  And another ŠŠ the 
other fellow, I think his name was Griffin.
 
Q: So, some were Jewish and so me were not?
 
A: Those two weren't.
 
Q: Were not.  Okay.  
 
A: But there were Q:uite a few 
Jewish fellows in the company.

d, he went to the eastern zone of Berlin, 
maybe he was symp athetic with the new move
ment.  He thought it would bring wo nders 

to Germany.
 
Q: You're talking ab out communism. 
 

A: Yeah.  And I understand that later on he 
had trouble with the dictatorial setu p.

h when  they divided th e comp any.  They 
took a group out of the comp any to form the 
3rd Mobile Radio Broadcast.  They  were the 
cadre from 3rd Mobile Radio Broadcasting Co mp
any.  I remained with 2nd.  And we 
went up to Camp Sharp at 
Gettysburg.  It's right on ŠŠ
 it was right on the battlefield.
 
Q: Oh, my.  Okay.  
 
A: In fact, Camp Sharp had originally
 been  commanded, during World War I, by 
Eisenhower.
 
Q: Oh, my.
 
A: That's h o w he became 
acQ:uainted with Gettysburg.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And after the war, you know, 
he moved to Gettysburg.  
 
Q: Yes, right.  To a farm.  Right.
 
A: In fact, someone else intervie
wed me who was interested in it.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: Did you hear of Beverly Eddy?
 
Q: No.
 
A: My name was given to her.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And she interviewed me, too.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I think she was a professor, I thi
nk of German.  And sh e was at Dickinson 
College.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And she's writing a book, I think, about Camp  Sharp.
 
Q: Oh, okay.  So, now you'
re at C amp Sharp and s
till doing your radio work.  
 
A: I was doing my  radio wo rk, and that 
was where we prepar
ed to go overseas.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And we weren't there very long, 
maybe a month, month and a half.  
 
Q: Are we talking ab out 1943?
 

A: 1944.
 
Q: 1944.
 
A: This is 1944.
 
Q: So, you were at Camp Ritc
hie, what ŠŠ what year? '44?
 
A: In 1944, too.  I went
 there February 19th, '44.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: We maybe stayed at R
itchie for about three weeks.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And then  we went to Camp Sharp.
 
Q: Camp Sharp.  
 
A: The 2nd Mobile. We used to call 
ŠŠ Camp Ritchie was very beautiful.
 
Q: Was it?  UmŠhum.
 
A: It was very close to 
where the presidents go. 
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: You know, Camp  David.  
 
Q: Camp  David.  Yeah.
 
A: It was at one time called ShangriŠLa.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Roosevelt used to go there.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: And the mountains are beautiful right there.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And Camp Ritchie, there'
s a lake right in the camp.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And they used to call it Camp R
itchie by th e Lake.  Beautiful location.
 
Q: So, now you're getting 
ready to go to Europe?  
 
A: I knew I was going to Europe, and from th
ere we went to ŠŠ from Camp Sharp, we 
went back  to Camp  Ritchie.
 
Q: Oh.
 

A: To stay a few days.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then we took the train from there to
 ŠŠ to Camp Shanks, wh
ich is in, I think, 
Rockland Coun
ty, New York.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: There was a big camp, and that was the 
camp ŠŠ one of the ca
mp s fro m wh ich  th ey  
sent troops to Europe.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: The other one being Camp  Upton, in Long Island.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: So, you go on a troop sh ip.  
 
A: Yep.  We went on the Queen Elizabeth.
 
Q: The Queen Elizabeth?
 
A: Yes.  We went on ŠŠ I think we got 
on the ship that was March 30th ŠŠ how 
many days in March?  Thirty or 31?
 
Q: ThirtyŠone.
 
A: Maybe March 30 or 31, I don't remember the date.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: We went down by train, from Camp  Ritchi
e, down  along ŠŠ th ey had th e west shore 
line of the New York centr
al railroad at that time.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: To the docks in New Jersey and to
ok a ferry across to the Queen Elizabeth.
 
Q: Oh, my.  
 
A: They had to set up 
a ferry at the pier.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I think alongside, the other side of 
the pier, was the Norman dy, that had been  Š
Š that had a fire or somethi
ng.  You've heard about that.
 
Q: I've heard about the Normandy, yeah.
 
A: And it ŠŠ it was on its side at the time.  
It was still ŠŠ I think still there when we 
were there.
 

Q: Now, how much did you kno
w about what was happening 
to th e Jews in Europe by 
that ŠŠ by '44?
 
A: Oh, we knew that.
 
Q: By '44.  
 
A: I was always aware of that.  
 
Q: Yeah.  Did your parents 
have contact with any family
 members who still were over?
 
A: Right.  In fact, I'm going to  give you an  
article to read.  The 
New York Times obituary 
of Monday, August 16th, 1943
, has an obituary for my gr
andfather, and here's the 
headline:  Abraham Pinkofsky dies at age of 
104.  On e of 13 gran dsons in war cited; 
three other lose lives.  And it 
tells about, there were nine 
ŠŠ I think nine grandsons of 
his were in the Amer
ican military service.
 
Q: Oh, my.  Oh, my.  
 
A: Of which, all of us came back.
 
Q: Wonderful.
 
A: None of us, I think, we
re wounded. Three of them 
ŠŠ the paper only mentions the 
grandsons who were officers.  One was Capt
ain David Weiss (ph).  At that time, my 
grandfather's death, he was a chief surgeon at 
Fort Totten, Queens.  
In fact, he told me 
that was the best year of his life, when he
 was there, because he had a beautiful home, 
right, at a beautiful area.  It's  a peninsul
a on there ŠŠ where the 
East River joins the 
Long Island So und. Another son had been an  
infantry  captain, another grandson.  And 
they took him out of the infantry, and he 
never went overseas.  He was assigned to, I 
think, Camp Detrick, in Frederick, Maryland.
 
Q: Fort Detrick.  Fort Detrick.  
 
A: Yeah.  It became Fort Detrick 
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And the reason they took him out of th
e infantry was, he had a doctorate in 
bacteriology.
 
Q: Yeah, right.  Right.  
 
A: And he did research on biological warfare. 
 In fact, I think he came down with anthrax 
himself.
 
Q: Oh, my  gosh.  
 
A: But he survived
.  They were work
ing with the bug.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  Right.
 

A: And another one, doesn't say where he was.
 
Q: Where ŠŠ let's go back  to your story now.
  So, you took the Queen Elizabeth over.  
 
A: Right.  With 20,000 other men.
 
Q: Twenty thousand.  
 
A: You couldn't imagine how crowded it was.
 
Q: Yeah.  And wh ere did you land?
 
A: We landed in ŠŠ I think it's ca
lled Gourock, the Port of Glasgow.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Is that correct?  
 
Q: I don't know.
 
A: I don't know names. And we were welcomed ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: ŠŠ as we landed in the mo
rning by a parade of a ba
nd of men in kilts playing 
bagpipes.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: That was our greeting to Great Britain.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And as we paraded off, we march to 
the train and that took us to England.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And it was a full day trip down  to a 
place ŠŠ I don't know what ŠŠ where they 
stopped, but I know wh erever we stopped, I ha
d gotten sick on the train.  I got land sick.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And the fellows helped me off onto a truck,
 and we went to a ca
mp at a place called 
WottonŠunderŠEdge.
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: I don't think you'v e ever heard of it.
 
Q: No.  
 
A: But a very famous man came from there. 
 Wyecliffe.  You ever hear of Wyecliffe?
 
Q: Yeah, yeah.
 
A: Wyecliffe translated the Bible to English.
 

Q: Right.  Into English, right.  
 
A: Right.
 
Q: You're talking ab
out April '44, right?
 
A: April '4 4.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I think it took us about
 eight days to get there.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Now, the Queen Elizabeth no
rmally would make England in
 about four days and five 
hours, but it took a wandering course.
 
Q: Yes.  I would imagine.  
 
A: Every trip was different.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And the ship chan ged course every six 
minutes. But the last night, as we were 
approaching the coast of England, up at Sco
tland, it was changing course every minute or 
two.
 
Q: Oh, my.  Oh, my.  
 
A: And people were falling out of the bunks.  It
 was just keeling.  Unbelievable.  But they  
got us there safely.
 
Q: Yes, right.  Right. So, then you 
were in Wyecliffe.  And then what?
 
A: We were there may b e about a week, and 
we went to another town, at ŠŠ called 
Clevedon, on the coast.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: A beau tiful town .  And from there, you could see Wales.
 
Q: And now this is still before DŠDay; right?
 
A: This is before DŠDay.  In fact, th
at's where we were preparing for DŠDay.
 
Q: And how mu ch did you know?
 
A: We didn't know too mu ch.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: But ŠŠ
 
Q: And you are still doi
ng your radio work?
 

A: Oh, yes.  But we didn't know too mu
ch .  We did our work , and that's all.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then  we went to ŠŠ from there, we'r
e there ma ybe two or three weeks, we went 
to a place called Pittsfield, abou
t 20 miles north of Bristol.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  Okay.
 
A: And we were in a camp there with ŠŠ 
I think there was a ŠŠ a PX company that 
ran PXs, and also a camouflage engineer batta
lion.  And that's where we had our last 
preparation for the invasion.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And one of the days just before the 
invasion ŠŠ in fact, maybe a couple weeks 
before the invasion, we would ŠŠ went tr
aining on every weapon we had in  the 
company.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: You fired every weapon.  Machine gun
s and rifles and submachine guns and 
pistols.  And suddenly, a c
ouple of groups of men from 
my  section were taken out.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: We didn't know where they went.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And they  ŠŠ and also one group th
at went, went with the radio truck.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: On a twoŠan dŠaŠhalfŠton truck.  It 
was what ŠŠ a doghouse.  I don't know if 
you've ever seen them.  And it was a radio, a
nd th en these were groups that were landed.  
 
One of the groups in my  section, we 
learned later, operated General Bradley's 
communication.
 
Q: Oh, my .  Were you in one of those groups?
 
A: Well, I wasn't in that group.
 
Q: No, I know.  But ŠŠ
 
A: They were ŠŠ 
came from my group.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: But we had no choice.  They 
took so me men, and th ey  left.
 
Q: Right.  Right.  So
, what did you do then?
 

A: So ŠŠ well, I rema
ined in the company.
 
Q: Right.  And then ?
 
A: And those groups landed on, I think D Plus One.
 
Q: Oh, okay.
 
A: The second day.
 
Q: Second day.  Ok ay.  
 
A: The ones with the radios for ŠŠ
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: ŠŠ General Bradley and also ŠŠ one truck reported war correspondents.
 
Q: Oh.
 
A: And they  were ŠŠ  that was ŠŠ the name 
of their radio station was Jig Easy Sugar 
Queen, JESQ.  They reported, 
I think, from D Plus Two on.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I remained with another unit, whic
h was a bigger broadcast unit than  that one.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Had ŠŠ it had two trailers.  And I could dr
ive a small truck.  I had never driven a big 
truck.  Before we landed, we were on 
a troop ship, and LST, Landing Ship , Tank.
 
Q: This is D Plus One?
 
A: No.  This is ŠŠ actua
lly, this is D Plus 20.
 
Q: Oh.
 
A: We were supposed to go in mu
ch before, but there was a big storm.
 
Q: I see.  S o , this is three weeks after DŠDay?
 
A: Twen ty days.  
 
Q: Yeah.  Okay .
 
A: When the rest of the company went there.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And the comp any co mmander asked me to dr
ive the trailer truck.
  And I said, "Look, 
I've never driven one of these. 
 If you order me to, I'll try."  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 

A: But I didn't want to drive it because it ha
d about six or seven forward speeds.  And I 
had never driven one.  I wouldn't be 
accustomed.  It would be ridiculous ŠŠ
 
Q: Right.
 
A: ŠŠ to founder around and try to figure 
out wh at to do when  you're landing at a 
beach.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: So, he had another fellow do it.
 
Q: Okay .  So , now you 
land on Normandy Beach?
 
A: Right.  And that day, we ŠŠ
 
Q: Do you know wh ich beach it was?  
 
A: Omaha.
 
Q: It was Omaha.  Oh, okay.
 
A: There were still explosi
ons on th e beach taking place.
 
Q: Oh, my.
 
A: Mines.
 
Q: Oh, my.  Yeah.  
 
A: And we drove up the h
ill that they had to take.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Which they took in the first day.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: The rangers took that.  We
 drove up the hill and stayed 
overnight up on t
op of the hill.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And then we went to a place called Colombieres.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Colombieres is on the ro
ad to SainteŠMereŠEglise. 
 
Q: UmŠhum.  Right.
 
A: Have you ever been there?
 
Q: Yes, yes.
 
A: Have you ever heard of Co lo mb ieres?
 

Q: I don't think so.
 
A: CŠoŠlŠoŠmŠbŠiŠeŠrŠe (sic).  That was wh ere 1st Army  headQ:uarters 
were.  And we were at the Chateau 
De Colombieres, outside the town.
 
Q: Okay .  
 
A: Our company was at the chat
eau.  Most of the men lived in the field around it, and the 
officers lived in the chateau.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And it had a moat around.  It was an old chateau.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And I operated a radio there.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I ŠŠ that time, I was with the transmit
ting section of the tr
ailer.  We had one 
transmittin g ŠŠ one big trailer with 
a transmitter, oneŠkilowatt transmitter.
 
Q: Did you have any mixing with the civ
ilians or any refugees at that time?  
 
A: No.  We didn't see any refugees.  This
 was a French area.  We saw French people.
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.
 
A: And we spoke to them.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And some of the fellows would go out and take a water can, and buy ŠŠ they would 
buy calvados from the farmers.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Do you know wh at calvados is?
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
 
A: But that stuff that th
ey bought was liQ:uid fire.
 
Q: I can imagine.
 
A: It wasn't  aged or anything.
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: I tried it once, and I spat it ri
ght out.  I never touched it again.
 
Q: How long were you there?
 

A: Well, we were there, maybe ŠŠ well, trying 
to think.  Well, while we were there, I 
was grabbed to go to ammunition supplies goi
ng to 128.  And I alwa
ys used to wonder, 
what does 128 mean?  And I finally figured
 it out.  It was the ammunition supply point 
one of the 28th Infantry Divi
sion, which was in Normandy.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And I was put in the ŠŠ they had me in
 a tent, to take care of the shells ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: ŠŠ that would be used for firing leaflets.
 
Q: Oh, okay.  
 
A: Actually, they were shells with smoke can
isters in them.  They'd  take out the smoke 
canister and put in a roll of leaflets.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And I was right there in that ŠŠ they gave
 me a pyramidal tent to sleep in above the 
ground with a cot. And at night, the German 
planes would come over.  We used to call 
them Bed Check Ch arlie.  And I noticed, here
 I am, and if any bomb  comes down close 
by, I'm right near the shells, I don't stand a chance.
 
Q: Yeah.  Right.  Right.
 
A: So, I noticed where the 
headquarters of the camp were.  That was in another 
field.  And the men had dug slit trenches, ab
out three, four feet deep, and they have 
empty ammunition cases across the slit tren ch, 
and they cover the ammunition cases with 
the earth that they had sh
oveled up as a protection.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So, after a few days being in  the ŠŠ in
 the pyramidal tent, and sometimes fellows 
were drunk going past and shooting like wild, I 
said, "Eh, I am going to go dig my self a 
slit trench."
 
Q: Right.
 
A: Where the headquarte
rs of the company is.
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: That way, I'm not right
 next to the ammunition.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And I was there maybe about a week.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And then  I went back to the comp any.
 

Q: And from there, where did you go?
 
A: From there, when we broke out of No
rmandy ŠŠ th e day before we broke out, the 
planes were coming over in droves, without 
stopping, dropping bomb s at the Germans in 
the SaintŠLo area.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And they  broke th rough Sa
intŠLo.  And I drove to Sain
tŠLo maybe the day after it 
was taken.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And the fields were full of
 dead cows. Unbelievable.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And in SaintŠLo ŠŠ there 
was a church in SaintŠLo.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: WellŠknown church.
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And right in the field in front of the 
church was a dead German.  See, when an 
American was killed, his body was immediately removed.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: The Germans, they wa
ited 'til theygot enough 
Germans to collect them.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: Prisoners.  In fact, when I was at that fiel
d where I was next to the shells, at the end of 
the field, there was dead German bodies a
ll over the place that hadn't been picked  
up.  And at night, I learned what
 the stench, smell of death is.
 
Q: Oh, dear.  Yeah.  
 
A: It permeated my clothes.  It was horribl
e.  But I wouldn't go near them.  I saw them, 
and I never went there again.
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Some fellows came with a truck from my  comp any, and th ere were looking fo r 

loot.  And th ey went to the bodies, and they  picked up th ings, you know, food and stuff 
like that.  And then
 they were sick.
 
Q: Yeah.  Right.
 
A: Stupid.  
 
Q: Yeah.
 

A: But I was there.  And then
 I went back 
to the company.
 
Q: And then  from SaintŠLo, where did you go?
 
A: Then we went, my section, were orde
red in to a place beyond ŠŠ in Brittany.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: We drove past Rennes, which is the capita
l of Brittany, to a village called Thourie Š
Š Thourie.  And there there had 
been a treme n dous radio station.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: 5,500Škilowatt station.  And the building 
had been bomb ed by 
our planes.  It was 
records.  But still you could get up to the r
oof.  And th ere were bombs all around.  And 
what the Germans didn't do to damage the tr
ansmitter, they did be
fore we got there.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: But we had two ŠŠ civ
ilian engineers, Mr. Morry Peace (ph), of CBS, and Mr. 
Darcy (ph), of BBC.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: They were working 
on repairing it, the transmitter.  I 
understand they did get it fixed 
after a while.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: But I was sent ŠŠ then I was taken off the transmission group ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: ŠŠ and sent in the studio trailer, to Renn
es, in Brittany, in the capital.  And I was 
there for a number of weeks.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: With a boy by the name ŠŠ fellow by th
e name of Dizzy Hemick (ph), who was a 
T52, but he was the best radioman in the 
company, and a FrenchŠspeaking fellow by the 
named of Jenot (ph). {coughing} Excu se me a minute. 
 
Q: Yep.  
 
A: And we took ŠŠ th e studio unit had two 
tremendous record players.  We had 26Š
inchŠdiameter records at ŠŠ with
 music, French music, conc
ert music, et cetera, that 
we played .  And we broadcast different peop
le, French people came in.  And one of the 
men who broadcast from our unit was Genera
l Koenig , who was the commander of the 
 
French Army 's fighting.  And one day, we se
t up at the cathedral and church  a broadcast 

for General de Gaulle.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 

A: Koen ig shook our hands; General de Gaulle
 didn't even acknowledge anything that we 
were doing work for him.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  You actually saw him?  
 
A: I was next to him.  We set up the broadcast.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: He didn't even thank us.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: In fact, he was like the man below 
God, maybe even  above God, who knows.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And I was there for a number of weeks.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  And then
 where did you go?  
 
A: Then, Jenot and I ŠŠ in fact, we had a 
civilian with us who worked us with, two 
civilians, Sheftel, man  by the name of Shefte
l, who later became ŠŠ he was from a very 
wealthy family in New York
, who became ŠŠ who Scholas
tic Magazine.  You ever 
hear of Scholastic?  
 
Q: Yes.  Yes.
 
A: And a Mr. Sullivan from BBC. 
 And we did br
oadcasting there.
 
Q: Where was this?
 
A: From Rennes.
 
Q: Oh, okay.  You're still there.  
 
A: And we were hooked up
 through the transmitter ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: ŠŠ by wire.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Where it went to the transmitter at Th
ourie and was broadcast.  It was Radio 
Bretagne.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: I was there a number of weeks.  And th
en Jenot and I were ordered back to  the 
company.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Which, at that time, Paris had no
w been  taken, had ju st been taken.
 

Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: It was at an old fort alongside the Vers
ailles, across from Versailles, which I got to 
after the war.  And we were th
ere a little time, not too long, be
fore we were sent out to 
Verdun, the battlefield.
 
Q: Oh, my.  UmŠhum.  
 
A: The old World War I battlefield.
 
Q: Right.  
 
A: And when you drove through 
the country in that area, farm
 area, we used to say, you 
could tell the success of the farmer by the ŠŠ by
 the size of the manure pile in front of 
his house.  
 
Q: Right.  Right.  
 
A: I don't know if you've ever been  there.
 
Q: Did you see any ŠŠ again, any refugees 
at all? Did you come across any of them?
 
A: No, not at that time.
 
Q: Not at that time.
 
A: Not at that time.
 
Q: Okay . So , moving along, wh ere did you then go?  
 
A: From then, I was at Verdun for a while.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: And then  I was assigned to an other unit with a twoŠan dŠaŠhalfŠton truck and 
that radio broadcasting doghouse.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: The BB radio operator of that.  And we we
re sent to ŠŠ oh, I had another experience 
before that.  I'll tell you. On e time, while I 
was at Verdun, they wanted to send some 
leaflets to the 1st Army unit at the Spa in 
Belgium.  And I was driving.  So I drove a 
threeŠQuarterŠton truck with leaflets.  And 
it was right close to the front.  And I drove 
up, and at one point, I skidde
d off the road.  I think above 
Longwy, before a lawn, and I 
just took ŠŠ I had a winch on the truck, 
and I just put it around th e tree, a tree, and 
pulled my self out, and got out to th e road, and continued.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And I went past Bastogne.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 

A: And as I came to the top of the hill, s
uddenly there was a mud slick on th e load, and I 
spun around.  And my truck landed up against 
a tree, but, fortunately, 
the spare tire, spare 
wheel, was on th e driver's side, and my  truck 
was disabled, but I was all right, and I got 
someone to ŠŠ a truck driver to pull me into
 Bastogne, this is before the Battle of 
Bastogne.  And I went to a 
place, and I called up my compa
ny, and they came and got me 
in a day.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: But that was my experience there. After 
that, I was sent to the 9th Army with  
 
Lieutenant Balthour (ph), Raymond Wilson, 
and Mike Arob (ph).  Mike Arob was the 
truck driv er, the twoŠandŠaŠhalfŠton truck driver.  And ŠŠ
 
Q: And where did you go?
 
A: We went to ŠŠ to ŠŠ to Maastricht. 
 On th e way Maastricht, it was uneventfu l 
until we got near Liege, maybe about 20 or 
so miles from Liege we
 saw light lighting up 
the entire sky.  We didn't know wh at it was.  
We had heard wh at it was, but as we got to 
ŠŠ closer to Liege, which is a major cros
sroads in the city, we noticed something 
odd:  Girls passing us wouldn't
 wave to us and wouldn't smil
e.  Well, we learn ed when 
we got to Liege what it was all about.  We 
got into Liege and s
uddenly buzz bomb s, VŠ
1s, were dropping all around.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 
A: And we were looking fo r a 
bridge to get across in the Ri
ver Meuse in Belgium, and in 
France, it's called the River Meuse.  We finall
y found a bridge to ge
t across, and we went 
up to Maastricht, and that was it.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And at Maastricht, for a number of days, 
we lived in the buildin
g wh ere the reporters 
lived and the sensors lived.  We slept in the ha lls, the enlisted men.  
And then  they sent us 
up to ŠŠ up to ŠŠ on top of a h
ill, in the village called Bamalyn (ph), top of the hill, 
there was a hotel, and I think th e 4th 
Mobile Radio Broadcasting Co mp any was 
there.  And we operated 
a transmitter.  The reporters would come up from ŠŠ 
 
Q: And, again, you didn'
t see any refugees yet.
 
A: No, we didn't  see any refugees, not there.
 
Q: And then from there, where did you go?
 
A: We didn't see refugees 
until we went into Germany.
 
Q: Let's get to that then.
 
A: After crossing in to Germany,
 we saw refugees all around.
 
Q: Okay .
 

A: I remember one city we were in, the last 
to wn we were in before
 we got to Die Alb, 
where we stopped, this place, people were 
breaking in to stores, and the German people 
stopped us.  Police started to beat
 them up, and we stopped them.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: We stopped them.  And that was about it.
 
Q: Did you talk to any of the refugees?
 
A: Not really.  Didn't have a chance.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  Yeah. And so, then , wh ere were you in  Germany?
 
A: In Germany?
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: At first ŠŠ well, we were ne
ar Die Alb for quite a while.  
 
Q: Right, umŠhum.
 
A: And then we were ordered, my  unit, 
the broadcasting unit, we were ordered to 
Bremen, and there we broadcas
t reporters from Bremen.  The 
war was over by then.  The 
war ended on May 8th.
 
Q: So, this is after May 8th?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And had you gone by any camps?  Had yo
u gone past any camp s when  you were ŠŠ
 
A: Well, I had an opportunity 
to go to Bergen Belsen, and 
I didn't want to see it.  
 
Q: Because?
 
A: I didn't want to see the uglin ess.
 
Q: Okay.  But you were, by that time,
 well aware of what had happened.  
 
A: I was well aware what happened.
 
Q: To the Jews and others.  Yeah.  UmŠhum.
 
A: And that was it.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: Basically, until ŠŠ let me see ŠŠ oh,
 when I was in the ŠŠ something 
else.  When I was in Rennes, we had a fello
w, another man wo rking with us, a language 
man, Irving Barrinson (ph).  And he ŠŠ we 
went with him once to a Dr. Loucarlay 
(ph), in the village of Qu
intin, QŠuŠiŠnŠtŠiŠn.  Irv
ing Barrinson had been a 
teacher in New York, French 
teacher, and before 
the war, he had studied at the Le Se 
(ph).  And he knew the son of this Dr. 
Loucarlay, and he wa
nted to  visit him.
 

Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And we visited him, Dr. Lo
ucarlay, we visited.  And 
Dr. Loucarlay's son had been 
taken by the Germans.  He didn't know wh
at had happened to 
him exactly.  No one 
knew. And we went ŠŠ and th is trip, too, we
 were invited to a liberation banQ:uet for 
Brittany.  And it was the biggest meal I ever had.  
 
Q: What was your feeling when
 you heard the war was over? 
 
A: Oh, well, I knew it was over, ending as we moved across.
 
Q: But, emotionally, what
 were your thoughts?  
 
A: I was very happy.  I was interviewed twice.
  Once by Lieutenant
 Fuller ŠŠ I think he 
later became an officer in 
my company ŠŠ on a wire reco
rder, and the second time, 
after the war was ended, by Bill Downs.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Of CBS.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: He wanted to get ŠŠ I was the GI that he chose to interview.
 
Q: Because were you Jewish?
 
A: No.  Because of the ŠŠ they wanted to
 interview me on the US, on the end of the 
war.
 
Q: Oh.
 
A: Nothing because I was Jewish.
 
Q: Okay .  Okay .
 
A: And that's it.
 
Q: So, then you stayed 
in Europe for how long?
 
A: I stayed in Europe ŠŠ well, after we were
 in Bremen maybe two or three weeks, and 
we were ordered to comp any to  the headQ:uarter at Wiesbaden.  And th en, at Wiesbaden, 
I did notice one thing th at was Jewish.  I used 
to go ŠŠ to where I 
used to go to get a 
bath, a bath house, attached to a Je wish cemetery, the Jewish cemetery of 
Wiesbaden.  And there were signs in
 it forbidding anyone from entering it.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: Put up by the Army.  But I didn
't see  any Jewish people there.
 
Q: UmŠhum. Did you talk to any Jewish 
refugees at all while you were there?
 
A: No, not really.
 

Q: Not really.  Okay . And 
so then you came back to
 the United States when?
 
A: I came b ack to the Un
ited States in November.
 
Q: Of '45.  
 
A: Of '45.
 
Q: Okay .  And befo re I ask you some questions
 about your thoughts, just tel l me, when 
you came back, you went back
 to school, and then ŠŠ
 
A: Well, I got a job teaching almost immediately.
 
Q: Okay .  And then ?
 
A: And I also went back to
 school to get my  degree.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: I wrote up my  master's paper.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: And I met my wife, and we married.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I had all the courses for a Ph.D.  In f
act, the head of the depa
rtment of history of 
Columbia University sp
oke to me, he says, "Phil, you ha
ve to take a year off from work 
and knock out your Ph.D."
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: In fact, I had had him as 
a teacher at City College.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: From City College, he went to Columbia. 
 And he was head of th e department. And I 
couldn't do it.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: Because I didn't have the time, and I had children.
 
Q: Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Can we now talk 
a little bit ab out what your thoughts are?  First 
of all, how you feel
 about Germany today?
 
A: You mean today?
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: I wouldn't go back to Germ
any, wh en I went to Europe of number of times since the 
war, because of what they ha d been done to the Jews.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.
 

A: And, now, I'm rath er sorry that I didn't go back.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.  Because?
 
A: Well, you know, there is a Je
wish community in Germany again.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: And I felt I want to go back 
to see it.  I've
 read about it.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.  
 
A: And, in fact, I have a record, one of
 my famous best CDs is ŠŠ was made in 
Germany, Jewish music.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I would have liked to have seen it again.  
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: I had an easy life when I was in Germ
any.  I was in Germany from ŠŠ maybe six 
months after the war.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: But I didn't associate with Germans.
  I Š Š  but it was a very easy life.
 
Q: But ŠŠ and post war, did you talk to  
any refugees, any Jewish refugees, any ŠŠ 
post war, wh ile ŠŠ in the six months ŠŠ 
during those six months after the war?
 
A: No.
 
Q: You did not. 
 
A: I didn't see them.
 
Q: You didn't see them. Okay
. Ok ay. Do  you think the Ho
lo caust could happen again?
 
A: I hope not.  What else?  There were so
me people wh o would gl
adly happen with the 
Holocaust.
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.
 
A: They're still here in  this world.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum.  When you were 
teaching ŠŠ and you stayed in teaching 
right, for your professional life?  
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Did you talk about your experiences as 
a soldier?  Did you bring that into your 
classe s?
 
A: Not too often.
 

Q: UmŠhum.  UmŠhum. 
 
A: There was no reason to bring it in.
 
Q: I see.
 
A: Once I mentioned the ŠŠ I mentioned 
ŠŠ I would mention the Holo caust in 
teaching.
 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  So, were you a histor
y teacher, high school history teacher?
 
A: Right. Yeah.
 
Q: Were you active in the civil rights moveme
nts? Considering people were deprived  of 
their civil rights during th
e '30s and the '40s.  
 
A: Well, I was for it.  But, you know, I 
protested the Vietnam war, and I supported 
ending it.  I thought it was ridiculous.
 
Q: UmŠhum.  
 
A: And I went to a me eting that students held.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: In Hicksv ille, behind a big 
sh opping center, and when I h
eard them talk, I Š Š  I said 
they were crazy.  They want to make a revol
ution.  They didn't  
realize that ŠŠ it was 
idiotic the way some of them were talking.
 
Q: These were people antiŠVietnam War?
 
A: Not only that, I saw some of the kids, 
too, who were antiŠVietnam in high school.
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: If they were in a club and 
talking with a group of kids, 
they wouldn't have let anyone 
talk who was ŠŠ didn't agree with them.  
 
Q: Yeah, right.
 
A: And, that, I opposed.
 
Q: Right. Have you been to Israel?  
 
A: Yes. I was there about ten days.  It was wo
nderful.  In fact, I cried.  When  we were 
with a group, we went to the cemetery 
where we ŠŠ the one leading th e group asked 
me to lead a ?sieska?.  And I cried there.  
 
Q: Aww.  Yeah.  Yeah .  This is a 
cemetery in Jerusalem, you're saying?
 
A: In Jerusalem, the main cemeter
y, wh ere they had the memo rials.
 

Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  Right. K
nowing wh at you did ŠŠ wh at
 you do now know about wh at 
happened  to  the Jews during th is time, '33 
to '45, did it make you mo re religious, less 
religious or ŠŠ
 
A: It doesn't make me more religious.
 
Q: Or less ŠŠ
 
A: You know, you can be ŠŠ I'm not over
ly religious.  I may go to services 
occasionally, but ŠŠ I belo
ng to the temple, but ŠŠ
 
Q: UmŠhum.
 
A: I'm not finically religious.
 
Q: So, it didn't affect 
your religious outlook.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Going through ŠŠ yeah. So, do you th
ink th e wo rld has learned any lessons?
 
A: Does it look it?
 
Q: Yeah.  Well, is there anyt
hing else you wanted to add ŠŠ
 
A: No.
 
Q: ŠŠ that we hadn't talked about your 
experiences during th e 
war?  Anything else?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Okay.  All right.  And so, I will conc

this by just saying a few wo rds.  Okay ?  Unle
ss there 's something else
 that you wanted to  
say. Noth ing else?
 
A: Well, I was going to  say, if you could ju

willing to be interviewed, he might have
 some very interesting things to say.
 
Q: We can talk about that later. W e can ta
