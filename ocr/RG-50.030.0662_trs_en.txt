buthis mother died atchildbirt h 
Œ  
Q: Uh-huh?   

A: -- 
with hi m. 
And so he was really raised by his oldest sister; t hen hi s father was an 
Orthodox. And on my mother's side, they were, I would sa y, modestl y observant, not 

hardly observant. 

Q: 
Hardly observan
t?  
A: Hardly observant.  They observed the holidays. 

Q: The Sabbath or the high holida ys or both? 

A: Just -- j ust the high -- just the high hol idays. More, more festively than religi ously.

Q: Oh no, not your parents, your mother's parents?  

A: 
Oh,the y spoke Yiddish.
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: 
And m yfather was probablyRussianand Yiddish.
 
Q: And when you were describing the level of observance, were you talking about your 

parents or your mot her's parents? 

A: My mother's parent s. 

Q: Oka
y.  
So your mother's parents would only observe the high holidays? Did they keep 
kosher; do you know? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you know what kind of professions they had? Did your grandmother work? 

A: 
My mother's 
-- 
Q: 
Your mother's 
mot her. Did she -- did she work or

A: I think she sta yed home. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she sta yed home. 

Q: And your mother's father, what was his profession? 

A: He was 
--
 he was a dairyman. 
Q: Like Tevye?  

A: Yeah. He was a dairyman. I think he was li ke -- I know that in the States he worked 

for a dairy company. 

  
 
Q: Do you know whether that -- that's what was -- that was what he was doing in Russia 
too?  

A: In Russia, Russia -- 

Q: He did to? Uh-huh. And on your father's side, you said the y were orthodox. Do -- 
What did they 
keep at home?
 
A: In Russia? 

Q: Yup. 

A: What di d the y keep at home?  

Q: In -- in t erms of traditions? 

A: Oh, wel l they -- they must have kept everything as far -- See, he was the only one in 

his family who i mmigrated. 
Q: Uh-huh.  
A: He -- he left in 1917, I think, or 1916.

--
 he was smuggled on a -- in a cold car -- 
in a cold car in a trai n and he crossed Siberia and China and came to Japan and came to 

the United States from Japan. 

Q: Wow. 
A: First in Seattle and he was the only one. 
Q: Now, did he have any male siblings? 

A: Yes, he had a brother. 

  
 
Q: Now I'm guessing t he male siblings would have also been subject to the draft; so, why 
did your father deci de t o leave and not the others? 

A: 
I'm 
not sure. I think the brother may have been exempt for some reason or injured or 
something. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I'm not sure. I don't remember that about  a brother. I k now he had a couple of sisters. 

I'm not sure about a brother.

Russia and she came with her father and her sister and the other si ster, the middl e sister,

A: Well, I know she got -- she got married in 1922.

A: I don't know. I think she went to school but I'm -- I'm not sure. 

Q: Did she have hi gher education? 
A: No.  She, I know, she finished high school in t he States. But I think she went to high 
school later or when I was -- after I was born, she took as an adul t education.  
Q: So she's 17 when she gets here and already pretty much eligible, marriageable 
age. 
So  

what does she do until age 26 when she get s married? 

  
 
A: I don't -- I don't know what she did.

Q: Do you know if it had a specifically Jewish clientele? 

A: I don't know. 

Q: Do you know whether -- 

A: 
My 
father worked in -- when he -- when he arrived in Seattle, he worked in the wheat

Q: No, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I don't want to cut you off. 

A: He worked as a, as a sewing machine operator in a men's clothing store.

Q: Uh-huh. So you grew up in Chicago; is that correct? 
A: Right. 
Q: So can you tell me where the apart ment or house was in Chicago where you grew up? 

A: Yeah, well in the early da ys, in infancy and very early c hildhood, we lived in the 

Humboldt Park 
-- Park District, I think it was on Potomac Avenue and then we li ved in 

 
Albany Park which was like Wilson Avenue was one place Wilson and Spaulding and 
then later it was Lawrence Avenue, alwa ys apartments. 
My
-- m y parents never had a car 
and the y never had a house. 

Q: I'm just -- I'm just going to put your microphone a litt le higher because I can see that 
it's, it's in your wa y. Just, sorry about that . So, you said Potomac Avenue, Albany Park, 
Wil s
on Avenue, and Lawrence Avenue. Thi s is throughout your chil dhood? 
A: Yeah. Oh, there was another place, Spauldi ng and Armitage, t hat's right; before 

Albany Park it was Spaulding and Armitage. 

Q: Oka
y.  
I will pause t he recording right now; just a sec. And we're back. 
So ,
 you had 
mentioned a few areas: 
Potomac Avenue, Albany Park, Wilson Avenue?
 

A: No, before Albany Park there was Spauldi ng. 
Q: Spauldi ng is before? 
A: And Armitage area which is -- was more Humboldt Park. 
Q: Now, are any of these areas or all of these areas, were t he y considered Jewish 

neighborhoods at the ti me? 

A: Not completely but, but some, somewhat, but not -- not Albany Park was considered a 

Jewish nei ghborhood but it was mixed. 

Q: It was mixed. 
So,I understand that y
our parents chose to live i n a mixed 
neighborhood? 

A: Yeah, I would sa y t hat in Chicago the divi sion street area was Jewish; the west side, 

Roosevelt Road area was Jewish, and Albany Park was Jewish. And then later there was 

 
a migration to Rogers Park, which was farther north. And I think nowadays it 's in t he 
suburbs, northern suburbs, but at t hen, those were the three areas. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
Now, sothey wereina pretty muchintegrated neighbor
hood throughout your 

childhood. Did -- To what extent did they keep traditions? 
A: My parents --

Q: Was having a Jewish identity, was that  a topic in the home or they just spoke of 

themselves as Americans or perhaps Russians who had left? 

A: No, Jewish identity was a -- As a matter of fact, I went to a Jewi sh school. 

Q: Oh, I see. So, how did the y define Jewi sh identity as growing up for you? 
A: Ethnic. 
Q: Oka y. Meaning were the y reading Yiddish press or? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. Oh -- 

 
A: He was reading a Yi ddish paper. 
Q: Oka y. Were the y political in any wa y? Alri ght.

Q: Uh-huh. Did the y take, I'm j ust -- I'm just going to sa y that your -- 
your 
-- when the 
microphone, so when you're -- 

A: Oh. 

Q: -- you move your hand towards your face then you're touching the microphone and it 

makes a noi se. Did they take part in any ki nd of demonstrations or di d the y do any kind 
of any political acti ons whatsoever? The y di d? What was important to them? In -- What 
were their ideals? When the y put you in a Jewish school, were you taught religion?

Social democrat?
  
A: Well, more.  
Q: A little bit more to t he left. How did the y feel about the situati on of blacks in 
America?

 Was that apparent in somethi ng that they di d or something or how the y 
spoke? Did the y di scuss -- 

A: The y di scussed it.  

Q: Oka y.  
A: The y read about it. The y went t o demonstrations about it. 
Q: Oka y. Did they ever take you to a demonstration?  
A: Yes.  

Q: How young were you when you went to these demonst rations? 

A: I don't remember. I think, probably early li ke early grades or earl ier before school and 

after. 

Q: Uh-huh.  
A: And then I went  to a Jewish school after school.  
Q: Oh, so you were in a public school and then you had extra hours after, okay -- 

A: Yeah. I was in a public school to learn Yiddish.  

Q: --to learn Yiddish. Was there any religious instruction? 

 
A: No.  
Q: Oka y. And --  

A: I was never Bar Mitzvahed.  

Q: Oh, really. Amongst your friends, what kind of friends did you have?

A: Well, I al wa ys had friends. Th
e y

Q: Did your Jewish friends tend to be nonreligi ous as your family? 

A: It was a mixture. 

Q: Oka y.  

A: Some were and some weren't.  

Q: Uh-huh . And that was never a cause for tension? You didn't have disagreements over 
that?  
A: No.  
Q: Uh-huh. And so you were in this Jewish school after public school, this wa
s between 

grades what  and what? Was this throughout school? In high school, too or? 

A: Oh, I don't think it was all the wa y through. I think i t was part -- I think part of high 

school. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And part of elementary and high school. I remember it was a storefront school. 
Q: What does that mean? 

A: It was --  it was a school in a st ore. 

Q: In a store?So somebody owned a store and the y would let it out, too? 

 
A: No, the school woul d rent, rent it. The organization then. 
Q: Uh-huh. So your parents, it seems, based on what you're sayi ng, were fairl y well-

informed and curious about the world. Were t hey paying attention to what was happening 

in Europe i n the '30's? 
A: 
Oh, yes. 
Yes. 
Q: So do you remember any conversations about this in the home?

Jews.

A: A lot, all the time. 

Q: Through -- 
through which medi a?
 
A: In the '30's. 

Q: How did you hear about it? 

A: Well, it was in the news. It was in their conversation. It was in the school that I went 

to. 

Q: The Jewish school or the public school? 

A: The Jewish school. 

Q: And it was a topic of conversation with your friends as -- as a chil d or as an 
adolescent? Or was it really the adults talking about it? 
A: The adul ts.  

Q: And when you sa y it was in the news, was it in the Yi ddish language news or also in 

the English language news? 

 
A: Well, it was in the English, too, about Hitler. 
Q: Uh-huh. And your parents were reading t he English language news? 

A: Yes, m y father read the paper every 
d a y.
 
Q: Now I'm not sure I asked this, but your parents did not -- obviously, they didn't keep 
any traditions so t here was no Kosher food at home? 
A: Right. 

Q: Was there -- was there anything else that -- that was an indicati on that this was a 

Jewish fami
ly?
 
A: Well, the y spoke Yi ddish. 
Q: Uh-huh.

Q: Careful of the mic. Careful of the mic. 

 
A: Oh, we had -- I had a favorite dish which was called Pachau (ph) which there was a 
Pechaw but this -- this was not Pechaw.  This was Pachau which was our own family 

thing. 

Q: What was it?  
A: It was a chip and soup. It was a thick chicken soup with egg and lemon.So it's sort of 
like Greek Avgolemeno but it was thicker and you eat it with bread.

A: You dip it. 

Q: When you would go over to your friend's house, did t he y pretty m uch have the same 

cooking you had at  home or was i t somehow an isolated phenomenon, the food that you 

had at home? Or was it the same cooking everywhere?

depression?  

A: That was on Lawrence Avenue. 

Q: Oka y. And did your -- your parent's situati on become better in the '30's? 

 
A: Well, let 's see. He got a job. When he lost his job at Hart Shaffner Marx and t he 
layoffs there, he got  another job with another clothing manufacturer but that was much 
lower level company. It was more of a sweatshop and he made less mone y and I 

remember that he di dn't value it very much. And then he 
--
 oh, he -- when he was 
working as a machine operator, he worked Saturdays as a shoe salesman in a depart
men t  
store in downtown Chicago. So, when after a while with the second job that he didn't like 

much, he went full-time as a shoe salesman. 

Q: Uh-huh. And this is what year? Early '30's? Late '30's? 
A: I would say mi d '30's.

Mid '30's. 
So it was after the New D

A: No. My mother didn't start working 'til I t hink after I left. 
Q: You left in the Army or you left -- 

A: Yeah. I left to go to the Army. 

Q: Now, did she start working because the y had a mone y issue or t here was some other 
reason that she start ed at that point? 
A: 
Probably money
 and also for something to do. And she -- she worked at something, 
she worked for the U.S. government in -- i n the treasury bonds processing. 

Q: Oka y. And this was -- this was after 1943? Or was this still during the war? 

 
A: It was during, yeah. 
Q: It was. But after you had -- after you had joi ned the Arm y? 

A: I don't remember if she started 
--
 she ma y have started when I 
--
 when I start ed college 
in '41. 
Q: You started coll ege in '41. So what year di d you graduate high school? 
A: '41. 

Q: Oka y. So you went t o college the Fall ri ght after? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And which college did you attend? 

A: Central YMCA College. 

Q: And thi s is in Chicago? 
A: I got a scholarship there. I got a half scholarship and t hen it became a full scholarship 
after I was there for a year. 

Q: The scholarship was based on maybe some -- 

A: A competitive exam. 

Q: A competitive exam. And the Central YMCA is in Chicago? 

A: Yeah. Now it 's Roosevelt University but it was Central  Y. 

Q: Going t o college was something you wanted for yourself or your parents wanted or 
both?  
A: Both. 

Q: Were you still living at home when you were in college? 
A: Yes. 

 
Q: And when you were in college by that ti me had your parent's situation ameliorated and 
were you in a bigger apartment? 

A: No. No, I think it was the same.I think I --  
Q: You were still sleeping on the couch?  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I did m y homework on the dini ng room tabl e. 

Q: And your father was a full-time shoe sal esman by that 
ti me?
 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did that business go well? 

A: His -- his work? 
Q: Yeah. 
Uh
-huh. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So the y -- the y weren't really squeezed for mone y by t hat ti me or do you recall feeling 

like money was an issue still at the ti me? 

A: Mone y was always an issue. 

Q: Mone y was always an issue? 

A: The y were alwa ys, seems to me to be, what's the word? 
Q: It was a topic of conversation or? 
A: Well, it was -- Well, economy was alwa ys important. 

Q: Uh-huh. Do you remember hearing about Pearl Harbor? 

A: Yes. 

 
Q: So how did you learn about it? 
A: Oh, it was in t he news. 

Q: Was that -- was 
that 
-- 

A: It was. 
Q: -- how you learned about it? 
A: Everybody talked about it or... 
Q: Well, that's what I'm curious about. Did you open a newspaper and that's how you 

learned about it or did someone tel l you, run up to you and sa y hey, t his is what just 

happened? Do you recall how you heard about  it first? 

A: No, I don't. I think somebody probably told me but it was on t he radio and then in the 

newspaper. I remember seeing the headlines. 
Q: Uh-huh. How did you feel when you saw t he headlines? 
A: Oh, upset and angry. 

Q: How -- At that t ime, how did you define yourself? Were you American? Jewish 

American?  Jewish American of Russian herit age? How did you think of yourself at the 

time?  

A: I thought of myself as American. I guess American Jewish. 

Q: Uh-huh. When you started college did you have a focus? Did you have a concentration 
of topic that you knew you wanted to pursue? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And what was t hat? 

 
A: Well, in high school , I wanted t o be a journalist because I was t he editor-in-chief of 
the high school weekly paper. 

Q: Wow. 

A: And I al so won a -- an essay contest. And but when I started college -- oh, before I 
started college, I had a high school guidance counselor and she gave me some tests, 
vocational i nterests and other things and I was so impressed with her job and her, her 

function that I decided that I wanted to be t hat. So when I started college, I told them I 
wanted to be a guidance counselor. I wanted vocational guidance as my major. 

Q: Now, what was --  

A: And the y said --  

Q: Yeah Œ  
A: -- the y said that means you should major in psychology. So t hat's what I did. So right 
from the start I -- I maj ored in psychology. 

Q: And what about  vocational guidance that really grabbed you? What was it that excited 

you about this? 

A: I think I think the idea of the -- of the various tests and -- and, I guess, you know, a 

met hodical wa y to help people wit h decidi ng on careers and what to go into.  

Q: Uh-huh. By the way, that -- that  test that she gave you, what was her guidance t o you? 
What career did she propose? 
A: Personnel administration. 

Q: She did?  

A: Yeah. Or something, you know -- 

 
Q: Something to t hat effect? 
A: -- working with people. 

Q: So since you were t he -- the edit or of the high school paper, you must have thought  of 

yourself or other people thought of yourself as a good wri ter. Was this something that 
your parent s were particularly proud of? Interested in? Did they give you feedback about 
this or?  

A: I don't -- They were alwa ys very, very complementary, very praiseful. They -- they 

were always very supportive. 

Q: How -- how good was their English at t hat point? 
A: Their English was pretty good. They were very concerned about  proper Engli sh. And 

m y mother wentt
o 
-- went to school to 
--
 to l earn more.  Their Engli sh was pretty good. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And of course he worked as a salesman, so. 

Q: Right. So he must have been good at communicating. I'm a little bit concerned -- 
a 

little bit confused about the ti meli ne of your father's j obs. Was he first in dairy and then 

in textiles?  

A: No, he was never in dairy.  My grandfather was in dairy. 

Q: Oh, I'm sorry, confusing everyone? 
A: My father was -- was -- 
Q: Right.  Right. 

A: -- in text iles. He was in tailoring, you know, 
clothing manufacturing.
 
Q: Right.  Right.  And t hen he goes into shoe salesman? 

 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did he work in a store? Was he his own boss? How did he -- 

A: Oh, no.  He -- he worked in a depart ment store. 

Q: A depart ment st ore?  
A: In a maj or depart ment store -- 
Q: Which one? 

A: -- in Chicago. The Boston St ore was the name of it. Netcher's, Netcher's Boston Store. 

And you know later in life, he -- 
they moved
 when I moved. When I got out of the Arm y, 

m y first -- When I got out of the Army, I went  to Stanford. That was t he school I was 

always interested in.So I went to Stanford. I went to Berkele y for t he first summer. And 

they moved to Berkeley because her sister, Ester, lived in Berkele y. By the way, the three 
sisters each had only children -- each had onl y one. 
Q: Really? What a coincidence. 
A: And one, Ester's and Bernard's son was a physicist and Sophie and Saul's son -- 

daughter was a lawyer. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And so, my parents moved to Berkeley and all the ti me that I went  through Stanford. 

And then I moved to Ann Arbor after 
that, they sta yedin Berkele y. 
Then I moved to 
Balti more and they moved to Balti more. 

Q: Now, was this because your family was a 
--
 

 
A: And he was -- When he lived i n Berkeley, he sold shoes in San Francisco at the major 
shoe store i n San Francisco, I can't remember the name of it. And then in Baltimore he 

worked selling shoes. 

Q: Well, it seems to me that your parents are moving from town to t own to be along wi th 
you. 
Was this -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- I'm guessi ng, thi s was kind of unusual that the nuclear family would stay t ogether 

even after the child i s an adult? Was this unusual? 

A: I don't know. 

Q: Oh?  

A: Probably. 
Q: Was there somet hing about your family that made them more t ight  knit than usual? 
A: Well, the y didn't have anybody else. The y just only had one child, so. 

Q: Did they have a soci al group of their own? Did the y have people t hat the y would go to 

dinner or have a card game or -- 

A: No, not much. 

Q: -- 
tea?
 
A: No. 
Q: So there weren't people, guests, in the house when you were growing up? 
A: No. Well, m y grandfather lived with us for a while. And then when we had a -- when 
we had the two bedroom apart ment, we had a roomer. We had a grocery store owner who 
-- who lived with us. 

 
Q: Reall
y? 
So he was renting out the -- the room? 
A: The room.So I alwa ys slept i n the living room.  
Q: Uh-huh. I see. Oka y so we are back --  
A: That's right. I never had a room of my own until after... 
Q: How do you think that affected you? 
A: I'm very interested in architecture. 

Q: 
Oh, yeah?
Oka y. So let's get back to your college years. So you start college in '41 and 
you're studying psychology. Are you studying anything else? 

A: Well, I took a lot of mat h because I was advised to take math for statistics. 

Q: Uh-huh. W
ere you goodat math? 
Bad at math? Didn't really care? 
A: I was okay. I got A's and B's in everything. I had all 
A's 
and B's, more A's than B's.  
Q: And I seem to recall  in a conversation before this intervi ew you said that you had a 
passion for music? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So this is something that came from your parents? 

A: My father was a music lover. He, you know, he listened to the symphony. He woul d 

go to the symphony.He would t ake me t o concerts. He -- I played piano. 
My parents gave 
me piano 
lessons when I was little. 
Q: But -- but there was no piano in the home? Or was there? 

A: Later.   What happened was, my parents got a bi gger apart ment. In order to rent a 
room to a distant cousi n, a woman and her daughter. So they lived with us and they Œ we 

had a piano. We had an upright piano. I don't know if my parents 
--
 

 
Q: When was this? 
A: -- got it or because I know that m y cousin Pat, Pearl was her name; Pat, the y changed 

it to Pat. She took piano lessons and then I did too. So, we were both taking piano 

lessons. 
Q: Oka y. So this 
--
 this piano in your home, when was this? How old were you? 
A: Oh, probably 10; 10, 12; 10, 12 to 14, something like that. 
Q: And did you pl a y any other inst rument s? 

A: Yeah, I played e flat alto clarinet  in the high school -- in the high school concert band. 

And I pla yed snare drum i n a marching band, a marching drum and bugle corps. 

Q: So, you said that you did not have your own room growing up but  you were pla ying 

all of these instruments. Clearly some of them at school. But was that not an issue that 
you had to practice an i nstrument and you didn't have your own area? 
A: No. 

Q: It wasn't imposing on other people?  

A: No. 

Q: Your father was list ening to symphonies on the radio or did he have his own records?  

A: Radio. 

Q: 
So  
-- so there was no gramophone or record or? 
A: No. 
Q: Oka y. So what -- If I understand correctly, you were not drafted; you volunteered?  
A: I volunteered. 

Q: Oka y. When was that and why was that? 

 
A: I volunteered in '41, I think, or '42, probabl y. 
Q: 
We
ll, you were i n college how many years before you went into the Arm y? 
A: I was in college two, two years but I had three years of credit because I took extra 

courses. 
Q: So if you started in '41 and you did two full years that would have been -- 
A: '43. 

Q: '43? So would that have been when you volunteered for the Arm y? 

A: No. No, I went in in '43. I went into the Army in '43. 
Q: So you volunt eered earlier -- 

A: In '41. 

Q: And you actually went in in '43?  
A: Right. 
Q: So what caused the delay? 

A: I -- I enli sted in a program called the ASTP, Arm y Specialized Training Progr
am; 

mil lions of guys did thi s. And it was -- it was a way to continue college until, I think, the 

end of the academic ye ar and -- and not go right awa y. So if  you enlisted, you could 

co
ntinue college if you were -- 
Q: -- already in college? 
A: -- in a field. If you were already in and you were in a field that they considered a 
specialized field. 

Q: And thi s was one such field? 

 
A: Yeah, right. So, I went in and was in college but then I-- I don't remember exactly why 
I got i mpatient and instead of stayi ng, I -- at  the end of that -- of that 
--
 of that year, that 
Spring of '43 I think, I asked to -- to go. 

Q: Now -- 
A: And not continue in ASTP. 
Q: And the ASTP would have given you the right to defer until when? 

A: Well, indefinitely. 

Q: Ok. 

A: Until graduation. 

Q: Until graduation? 

A: Right. 
Q: Now, what was your motivation to enl ist to volunteer? 
A: I was so interested i n personnel admini strat ion and industrial psychology that I 

thought t
ha
t I coul d do it in the Army. And so I asked to -- to go.  
Q: Did someone, some kind of advisor, confirm t hat that was an option that the y would 

be able to do this or thi s was just your own idea? 

A: 
No, yeah.
  
Q: Oka y.  
A: So I went in the 
Arm y and 
-- and I was -- I went to infantry basic training which -- 
Q: Where? 

 
A: It was North Camp Hood, Texas; which now is Fort Hood. And it was rough and it 
was -- 
there wasno running 
-- there was no plumbing and there were lister bags for 
water. 

Q: What's a list er bag?  
A: A lister bag is a wat er holder. It 's a big -- it's a big bag with a faucet at the end of it. 
Q: 
So you'
re sayi ng there is no plumbing? How -- how did you and other guys clean 
themselves? 

A: No, I th ink there -- t here were showers but there Œ  

Q: There were showers? 

A: -- but there was no water pumps or anyt hing else. I know we were alwa ys short of 

water.  Basic traini ng started on the 4th of July in Texas. 
Q: Of '43? 

A: Yeah, it was really rough. 

Q: Can you describe what kind of -- what kind of 
regiment you had?
 What you had to do 
in a da y? 

A: Well, all  of the usual military training t hings. 

Q: How physical would it have been? 

A: And ending in a 25-mil e hike. 
Q: 25-
mile hike?
 
A: In a full -- full field pack hike. And there was also crawling under machine gun fire, 
theobstacle course, and 
-- and just and listeni ng to lectures. 
Q: Lectures on what? 

 
A: Military, you know, arms like -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- the nomenclature of the rifle. 

Q: Now, how did your parents feel about you volunteering? 
A: That wa s oka y. 
Q: The y were -- 

A: The y were worried. 

Q: -- supportive? 

A: Well, the y were worried about me in the service but -- but they were supportive, yeah. 

Q: 
How manyof your 
--
 your friends or acquaintances were doing the same at the time?  
A: Well, some were drafted and I don't know whether anybody el se was doing what I did. 
Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.In basic training, were you the only Jewish person there i n your unit? 
A: I think t here were one or two others. You know, I should sa y before I forget that, I'm 

jumping the gun here, t hough. 

Q: Yeah, go ahead. 

A: I was hoping that I would be assigned to personnel or classificati on because t hat's 

what -- that's what I wanted. And at the end of basic, the y did put me i n the camp office 

in classification which is what I li ked. 
Q: How much ti me was there between the beginning and the end of basics?  
A: Well, basic training was 13-weeks at that time. 
Q: Oka y. 

 
A: Well, I did work in t he office for a little while and I thought I had it all made and that I 
was part of the camp and I wasn't shi pped out. And then orders came through. 
I guess 

what happened was that the Army needed more troops and more combat troops so the 

order came in closing or -- or changing our office. 
Q: How much ti me did you spend in the office before that order came through? 
A: I don't think it was more than a month or two. 

Q: Oka y. So we're still  in '43? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So then -- So, I was shipped out and al ong with maybe one or two other peopl e that 's 

all. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And so I was shipped out to a t he 71st Light Division which was j ungle and mountai n. 

And that was at Camp Carson Colorado.  And that was in preparat ion for Asi
a.
 
Q: Uh-huh. What kind of training was that? 

A: That was also rough and it was -- there was a maneuvers there -- i n the -- it was 

raining and -- and t here we had no light -- light  infantry means thi s was a mule pack 

outfit. There was -- there were three light di visions: The 89th, t he 14t h, and the 5th. I was 
in the 5th, regi ment s, pardon me. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The 5 regiment and the 14th and the 66th. And --  

Q: You said somet hing mule. What was the expression you used? 

 
A: 
Oh, mule. 
Mul e pack. 
Q: What is that? 
A: Mules l ike our outfit was just backpacks and carts I thi nk 
pulli ng, pull
-carts, 

backpacks. And another Light Division was al l mules. 
Q: Uh-huh. So -- so what is all mules? You sai d you were carts and backpacks? 
A: Mules. Yeah, we were backpacks and something else, I forgot. Light, meaning that 

you could go without cannon. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Without tanks. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Without heavy t rucks and stuff like that. So it was all on foot. But  I think we had a 
kind of a cart. But anot her division was al l mule packs. 
Q: So what is a mule pack? 

A: 
A mule is 
-- is a donkey. 
Q: 
Oh,so theseare act ually mules?
 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I thought it was maybe a code for some ki nd of -- 

A: No, no they were -- 
Q: Mules. 
A: -- mules. The y had mules that carried -- 

Q: 
So the y had mules with them?
 
A: And the y would carry things. 

 
Q: I s
ee. I see. 
But you were not in that division? 
A: No. 

Q: Oka y. Now, given that you had -- 

A: But I -- I -- I --  
Q: Yeah. 
Yeah.
 
A: -- want to sa y that by volunteeri ng and going into that -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- then I was just in the infantry and I was 
--
 I was in t he -- in t he mud.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: One day a guy from headquarters that I knew was a friend of mine saw me in a 

foxhole in the rain and he said Les, is that you? And he sai d considering your 
background, let's see what we can do. And so he got them to -- to think of me for -- for 
Service Company, which would be classificati on. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So then later, when I was in classification, I was in charge of getti ng the new men 

coming into the outfit into their units. Well the new men coming into the outfit, by 
then I 

was a corporal, the new men coming int o the outfit were buck privat es and the y were -- 

they were raw like raw recruits.  
Q: Recruits. 
A: 
Becaus
e they had just come from ASTP. ASTP ended.  
Q: I see. So it would have been your cohort?  

A: And the y w
ere a
l l shipped out of college. So I, you know, had the advantage. 

 
Q: Uh-huh. This, t his man who you knew, a friend of yours, do you remember hi s name? 
A: No. 

Q: Do you remember where you knew him from? 

A: From t he Arm y itself. From just -- 
Q: But from Colorado or ma ybe had you been together in Texas or?  
A: No, I think it was C olorado. 

Q: And so, during this whole process you said that maybe there was one other Jewish 

person there. 
Was 
-- Did the other--    
A: There was one Jewish guy who was t he newspaper reporter. His name was Irving 

Werstein. I remember hi m. 

Q: Did the other men in this unit  know that you were Jewish? 
A: The 5th Regi ment was originally in Panama in peaceti me and most of the people in it 
were from Kentucky and Tennessee and the y were hillb
il ly typ es.
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the y didn't -- t hey didn't know much about that. About Jewish or whatever. 

Q: So the y would not have been aware? 

A: No, I think there was some anti-Semiti sm from somewhere but  it wasn't 
--
 it wasn't so 
much Jewi sh as it was cit y and col lege. 
Q: Uh-huh. And you had both? You had been a college boy and a cit y boy? 
A: Uh-huh, right. 

Q: Was thi s an issue? Did the y make it an issue? 

 
A: Yes. Yes, because t hey were in much better shape. I mean, the y were more used to 
that kind of life than I was. 

Q: Uh-huh. Did the y taunt you or did the y treat you badly? 

A: Well, I remember one da y I was huffing and puffing climbing a mountain and I said, 
I'm not used to this. I said, I grew up in Chicago where 
--
 where I'm used to escalators 
and elevators. 
Q: What di d the y sa y?   

A: So, so he laughed. But later that night  around the campfire, he told the other guys what 

I said and t he y in a taunting, teasi ng, hostile way. So I... 

Q: But this -- this didn't escalate? The y didn't actually hurt you or? 

A: No. 
Q: There was no -- They didn't isolate you for being different? 
A: No, I think I was cl oser to a couple of guys that were more city. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That we were different from the -- from everybody else. 

Q: And you had your own support group then? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Now given that you had had very different ideas about what was going to happen 
before you got the desk job, before your friend finds you in the foxhole, so during those 
months, how are you coping with the disappoi ntment? Is it a disappoint ment? 

A: It wasn't. I mean, I just took it  as life; something to cope with. I didn't -- I didn't try to 

do anything about it -- 

 
Q: You weren't angry? 
A: -- 
except copewith it. 
No, it 's just the Arm y, t hat's all. I mean, I figure that 's just 
normal. 

Q: Now -- 
A: When I got orders t o go -- to go to the 71st  Light Division, I did look up what a Light 
Division was in the camp library and it said j ungle/ mountain, mule pack, amphi bious, and 

paratroop. 

Q: And what did you t hink when you saw that? 

A: And then I -- I said God, I don't want any of those. And then it turned out to b
e a 

combination of two of them: Jungle and mount ain. 

Q: Right. Uh-huh.  
A: But you know m y son was a paratrooper. 
Q: Really? 

A: 
So .
 
Q: When? 
What year?
 
A: Oh, 20 years ago or so. 

Q: 20 years ago or so. 

A: No, more than t hat. He's in his 50's so. 
Q: Was there a war on? 

A: No. 

Q: It was i n peaceti me?  

A: Yeah. 

 
Q: Oka y. Because you were not drafted. 
You were 
-- you were a vol unteer. 
Did you 
enjoy any perks? Was t here anything given to you as a reward for that or you were just 
treated the same? 

A: My i mpression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it 
was an old Panama out fit. It was a regular Arm y outfit, 5th Infantry. 
Q: So those were not draftees? 

A: No. But -- 
but the
n t here were draftees, too. So, there were both. 
Q: And there was no di stinction between an enlistee and a draftee? 

A: Well, I think the newer ones, like the ones who were drafted, along with me, we -- we 

were different, you know, coming from cit ies or with more educat ion than these other 

guys that...  
Q: But the system didn't treat you differentl y?  
A: No. 

Q: 
Oka y. Oka y. 
So this -- 
this man
 recognizes you in the foxhole. Thi s is your -- your big 
breakthrough moment andhe
 -- 
he takes you where? 
Where do you end up?  
A: In Servi ce Company, the same regiment. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But instead of Company F, which is a line company, and I was on mortar. I was a 60-
mil imeter mortar amm unition bearer. And I thought that I was lucky t o get that -- to get 
that assignment becaus e the mortar squad is a little behind the lines. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because you have to shoot over --  

 
Q: Right, right. 
A: You know -- but I was there were -- there were seven ammuniti on bearers in a mortar 

squad, I think, or five or seven, I don't 
remember. 
And I was tail end.I was the last one i n. 
So I considered myself really lucky --  
Q: Sure. 
A: -- that I got that job. 

Q: Sure. 

A: 
So .
 
Q: And then you're taken out of that company and put into Service Company? 

A: Right. 

Q: And what -- what letter is that?The S
ervice Company?
 
A: Just Service Company.  

Q: Oh, it doesn't have a letter? 

A: No. 

Q: Oka y. And are you given training in the Service Company? 

A: I don't remember any training. I think I had to learn the personnel situation. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Personnel procedures and everyt hing. 
Q: So you said earlier you were processing the new recruits, the boys who had been 
ASTP and who had just -- just graduated? 

A: That was in thi s. 

Q: In this company? 

 
A: No. 
Q: No?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes?  
A: Right. 
Q: Are you still in Col orado at that point? 

A: No, we moved t o -- 
We changed
 to a Full Division from a Light Division. 
Q: Oka y? 

A: So I thi nk that's why I got the j ob in Service Company because it expanded. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Everythi ng expanded and classification specialist, I guess, was created or I don't know 
whether it was there before. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But when we changed to a Ful l Division instead of a Light Di vision, we went to Fort 

Benning, Georgia and t hat's where we were. Fort Benning. 

Q: How long did you st ay in Fort Benning? Approxi mately when did you get there and 

when did you leave? 

A: I think until we went to overseas. 
We
 went overseas from New Jersey. 
We were there 
just very briefly in New Jerse y. But --  

Q: So when did you get to Georgia and when did you leave Georgia? 

A: Well, I don't  think we went -- we got overseas until '45. 

Q: January '45 i s when you got overseas?  

 
A: Something like that. 
Q: So, when you enlist, this is '43, you do 13 weeks of basic training. So 13 weeks, what  
is that? That's about three months? 
So, you
're in the Fall of '43 and then you're going into 

-- your -- then you go t o Colorado because basic training is in C alifornia; did I get this 
right?  
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: Texas, Texas is basi c training. And then you go t o Colorado? 

A: And then Colorado. 

Q: 
And you 
stayed in Colorado a whole year? 
A: Part of Colorado was in, I think part of Colorado I must have been in Service 

Company t oo at the end of it. 
Q: Oka y? 
A: But -- but I may have been there a full year but I -- I think we were in Fort Benning 

longer. 

Q: How long did you st ay in Georgia? 

A: I'm not sure.  

Q: Oka y. 
Was 
-- was your job different in Georgia? Did you do different tasks there?  
A: No, there it was Classification Speciali st 275. 
Q: And when you get your orders to ship out, how do you feel? What 's 
your reaction?
 
A: Just expected, t hat's all it was. 
Q: You weren't worried? Scared? Apprehensive? 

A: No, not that I remember. 

 
Q: Oka y. All right . So i n '45, at the beginning of that year, where -- where are you 
shipped to?  

A: We landed in Normandy but by then t here was no beachhead anymore. It was all a 
port. 
Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
A: You know, so, with -- with land ing docks and stuff like that. So we landed there and 

we camped i n Fort -- now what was it called, Camp Lucky Strike. 

Q: This is in France? 

A: 
Yeah
, Camp Lucky Strike. Camp Chesterfield. I think we were -- t he French called it, 
"Luke y Streak". 

Q: Was it close to Normandy? Was it in Normandy? 
A: In Normandy. 
Q: In Normandy. And what were you doing in the camp? 

A: Uh-huh. Well, t he same, same things. I mean, I was worki ng in Service Company and 

classification. 

Q: But -- but what  kind of tasks were you assi gned? Or were you still  processing new 

draftees in France? 

A: No, no.  
Q: What were you doing? 
A: I don't know, it was just keeping track of personnel. 

Q: How long were you in Normandy?  

 
A: 
Sh
ifts, promotions, I don't know. I don't remember how long but I know that when we 
started going across, I Œ I remember there was a town of Bitche, B-I-T-C-H-E.  
Q: B-I-T-C -H-E?  
A: And Kul mbach in Germany was -- we 
wer
e  in Alsace Lorraine first. I don't remember 
the town, but I thi nk -- 

Q: While you were in 
--
 still in France, were you interacting with any of the local 
population?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So what -- what  kinds of -- 

A: I took French in high school. 

Q: Oh, really? 
A: 
So
, I was the French interpreter. It was rough. I mean, I -- 
I mean, m y French was 
rough. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But I was the official getter of wine. 

Q: So how did that happen? How did you get the wine? 

A: Well, at the end of the da y, you know, we could go into town. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: So we went int o the village and I would ask for -- for wine and there was something 
else, there was two t hings. And of course, we were alwa ys in good shapes to -- good 

shape to barter because we had cigarettes and that was what everybody wanted.  

 
Q: Was that the only thing you bartered or was there anythi ng else? Rations or chocolate 
or?  

A: Chocolate. But I remember sayi ng, (?"Aba do divan"?). Oh, I know, it was "vin rouge 

or vin blanc".That's ri ght. 
It wasonl y t wo 
--  
Q: So you didn't get down to the varietals. You didn't  talk about what kind of wine it is? 

You didn't sa y -- 

A: Oh, no.  

Q: -- I would like a burgundy wine? Or no? No, it was just red or white? Both? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did they have both? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you have a preference? 
A: But mostly red, I thi nk. I don't know. I wasn't hot on wine drinking any wa y. I brought 

it back for the other guys. 

Q: 
Was 
-- was actual ly alcohol consumption, was that something your parents did? Did 
they drink wine at home ever? 

A: My parents didn't drink.My father would take a shot of schnapps only at a party or 

something. And he never was drunk. My mother wouldn't dri nk. 
Q: And so growing up had you had any experi ence with alcohol in hi gh school? In 
college, before you ent ered the Arm y? 

A: No. 

Q: There we re no parti es? 

 
A: With alcohol? 
Q: No?  

A: No. 

Q: So when you were t asked to bring back thi s wine, you had no interest in it? 
A: No. I don't 
--
 I'm not sure about that. Ma ybe I was interested i n tasting it or but not a 
great deal. 
Q: And the other -- 
the othersoldiers,did the y drinktoo much?
 
A: Well some of them did, yeah. 
Q: The y di d? Did they misbehave when the y drank too much? 
A: Oh, yeah, there was some times cases of fighting or passing out or... 

Q: So the misbehavior would be on base? It would not be in the village? It would not be 
in with locals? 
A: Right, right. 

Q: There was no incidents with locals? 

A: No, I don't remember any. 

Q: When somebody misbehaved, given that you're in classification, di d you have to write 

up a report?  

A: No, that was -- t hat was done -- that was not done by me. That was court-mart ials. 
Q: Oka y. Oh, oka y. So you were bringing back wine. And what other tasks did you do as 

an interpreter?  

A: Laundry. 

 
Q: So you took -- You were speaki ng with the locals in order to get t he laun
dry done? 
Wit h women? 

A: I don't remember anyt hing else. 

Q: So, how long 
--
 how long was your stay in France? You get there at the beginning of 
the year. 
Is it still cold when you leave? 
A: I don't remember. I think it must have been. I -- I do remember Kulmbach and there 

was beer -- 

Q: Oka y. 

A: -- there. 

Q: This is Germany? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Now, 
approxi matel y wherein Germany? 
What's a big city there? 
A: Kulmbach was 
--
 was a big city. 
Q: Oka y. Close to or in, in wh
ich state?
 
A: It's 
--
 I don't know t he state but it was closer to France. 
Q: 
Oka y. Uh
-huh. Is it spelled K-U-M-B- A-C -H? 

A: K-U-L- M-B-A- C-
H.
 
Q: Oka y. All right . So t hat's your -- in your memories that's your first German 
experience?  
A: Yeah, if I could see a map, there might be a some other -- some other towns that we 

stopped in before that but I can't remember them. 

Q: Uh-huh, all right.So tell me about Kulmbach. What happened t here? 

Insdg
 
A: Nothing except that it was an interesting, it was a German city and there was -- it had 
the buildings and the narrow streets and so on and beer and that 's all I remember. 

Q: Oka y. Tell me about the beer. You weren't very interested in alcohol so why did you 

mention the beer? 
A: Well, I just remembered that was one of the features there that t hey talked about.  
Q: Oh.  
Wha
t about the locals i n Kulmbach? Did you interact with them? 
A: It seems to me t hat I -- I was suspicious of all of the Germans and didn't know who 

was a Nazi and who wasn't and was ki nd of not friendl y with them li ke I was wi th the 

French. 

Q: And how did you feel about the Germans i n general? Did you, because the wa y you're 

describing i t, what I'm understandi ng, is t hat you had a sense that some were not  Nazi's. 
Did you have a feeling that some had b
een part 
of the system and some had not? Or did 
you have a stronger sentiment of kind of a blanket feeling regarding towards them that 
they must of all been a part of the system? 

A: Well, everybody said "nicht Nazi, nicht Nazi." But no, I had a sense that some were 

and some were not but most were. 

Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So does that mean that you were -- you pretty much did not  interact 

with the population at that point yet because you weren't sure what you were in for?  
A: Right. Also, we weren't there. 
We were
n't at any place l ong enough. 
Q: How long did you say? 
A: You know, wel l, we -- we got into combat 54 da ys before the end of the war; oka y? 

Q: Oka y. 

Insdg
 
A: So, when was 
--
 when was V-
E d a y?
 
Q: Ma y 8th? 
A: Ma y 8th. So 54 days before Ma y 8th was what? 

Q: 
Roughly two months. 
So that would put it at early March; right? 
A: Uh-huh. So that's when we went into combat. 

Q: And where did you go into combat? 

A: And I t hink it was around Kul mbach; but I'm not sure. 

Q: 
Oka y. Okay. 
And what was your first experience of combat?  
A: Well, see, I was in Service Company; so it was, I don't-- I don't -- We weren't in 
combat. I mean, they were, the front lines, t he line companies were in actual combat. 

Q: 
Right, uh
-huh.  
A: And we were behind them, following them. 
Q: Sure. 
Su
re. 
A: So we knew what was going on but we weren't directly in i t. 
Where we were, we were 
taking over what had already b
een 
-- 

Q: Liberated?  

A: -- victori ous for us, so. 

Q: And -- and again, what -- what tasks were you doing? Were you still only processing 
your own people's -- 
A: 
Yeah, yeah.
 

Q: -- papers?  So you were -- you were not worki ng on local issues whi le the Arm y was 

advancing?  

Insdg
 
A: No, not that I -- no not that I -- 
Q: Did you ever see combat before the end of the war?Were you in any ki nd of danger? 

A: Yeah, there was 
--
 t here was one ti me when there was some shoot ing or some sniper 
or something.But in general, no, I was not in combat.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
So  
-- 

A: There was one da y, one -- one ti me that was dangerous. I don't remember whether it 

was a truck, something was blown up or shot or somethi ng but. 

Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

A: But I wasn't hurt. 

Q: How did you learn that the war was over in Europe?  

A: I don't remember exactly. I think it just was announced all over and celebrated. 
Q: Where were you when -- when the war was over? 
A: We were in Ste yr Austri
a.
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Or near Steyr Austria on the Inn River; we had met the Russians. 

Q: So when did you meet the Russians? 

A: That was -- When was the war over, May? 

Q: Ma y 8th. 
A: Ma y 8th. So I would say it was in Ma y. 
Q: So that -- that one week, it was one week before. It was the week of -- that's when you 

met  the Russians? 

A: I think so, around then. 

Insdg
 
Q: So can you describe what happened when you met the Russians? 
A: All I remember was that there was toasting and -- and j oyful meeti ng and celebrating 

and -- 

Q: Did the -- did the two groups mix? Was there any kind of interaction between the 
Soviet Arm y and t he U.S. Army? 
A: I don't -- A l ittle bit . 

Q: 
Did y
ou -- Do you recall ever meeting the Soviet sol dier? 
A: More b y the officers, not much by us. Our 
--
 
our major
--
 our major meeting was with 
former concentration camp people that were strewn, that were wherever we went , you 

know. 

Q: When did that start happening? That wherever you would go you would bump into, 
run into?  

A: Oh, I would sa y probably from -- from Central Germany on; especially in Bavaria and 

Austria. It was the worst in Austri
a.
 
Q: So, if it started in Germany, do you recall when you first -- when your company first 

came across a concentration camp survivor?  

A: No, I don't remember when -- 

Q: Do you recall -- do you recall your first thoughts? Did you know who these people 
were?  
A: Yeah, I knew they were -- Well, the y wore striped, st riped li ke pajama like uniforms. 
Q: Right. 

A: And some of them l ooked like skeletons. 

Insdg
 
Q: Where were you comi ng across these people? 
A: Several places across Germany and Austri
a.
 
Q: Fields? Roads? 

A: But I think the most -- 
the most 
-- the largest one was this camp that we opened. 
Q: Oka y. So, tell me about that.  
A: Well, that was -- What was the name of it again? During -- 
Q: Gunskirchen? 

A: Yeah. Gunskirchen Lager. Anot her GI and I walked awa y from our unit and j ust 

strolling and we -- 
we cameacross thiscamp an
d we opened the door and out poured 
some prisoners and some of them were so, looked like skeletons and -- and one 
--
 one 
called to me in Yiddish and said, "I'm one of you." 
"I'mone of you."
 
Q: -- So the prisoner said to you, I'm one of you? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Now, did he know t hat you spoke Yiddish or understood Yiddish? 

A: He didn't. I guess I looked Jewi sh. 

Q: And so you hear thi s. What -- what is passi ng through -- 
A: He said, "Haberach Monus (ph)" have pity, have sympathy. 

Q: What di d you do when you heard that? 
A: I didn't, not hing. I just, I mean, you know, we had a rifle and a steel helmet and we 
were in full gear and they stumbled out and -- and some, he -- he dropped and I think he 

dropped dead. And there was some who dropped dead and some j ust started flowing out 

so we ran back to our unit to try t o get medics and to try t o get everybody involved. 

Insdg
 
Q: But this was not the first time you had seen people in t hese stri ped uniforms? 
A: No, I had seen -- we had seen others before. 

Q: How frequently had you seen t hem? Just a few incidents or?     
A: Yeah.     
Q: And those inci dents were -- I Œ I understand 
you
 probably don't remember the exact 
location but what was the -- where was it in a field? Or on a road? Or in an other 
camp  
where the y concentrated? Was it many people? Few people? 
A: I think i t was a few. 

Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing? 

A: I think so, yeah. 

Q: And you had known what about  them exact ly at that ti me? 
A: That the y were concentration camp prisoners. 
Q: And you knew about concentrati on camps because? 

A: Because I read about them.  

Q: In where?  

A: I don't know. Maybe, ma ybe the Yank paper, ma ybe the GI paper or -- or well , I knew 

about concentration camps from the ti me I was a civilian. 

Q: But would you -- would you know that the striped uniform is what a concentration 
camp inmat e wears? 
A: I think so. 

Q: Did the Arm y ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these 

people?  

Insdg
 
A: I think 
--
 I think they did. I think there was some discussion about  it. 
Q: 
Do y
ou have any concrete examples? 
Any details?
 
A: No, I don't. No. In mil itary government we learned a lot about it. 
Q: But that was after having -- 
A: That was Œ 
Q: -- liberated? 

A: -- that w as later.   

Q: -- 
Gunskirchen. Uh
-huh. So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what 

you're seeing is what? 

A: You know, I'm a lit tle confused about prisoners of -- German prisoners of war that 

were huddled together in trucks and the y were carried, the y were dri ven away from 
where the y were capt ured and prisoners of -- and concentration camp prisoners with the 
striped uniforms i n trucks. It seems to me that I saw them in trucks, t oo but I'm not sure 

that they were rescued and carried and that I -- we passed some of them on the roads. I 

don't know, I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before 

that ti me and that we saw some. 

Q: So as you were describing, you opened the gates. Were t he gates l ocked? 
A: No. 
Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Why had they not opened it? 

Insdg
 
A: And the guards were all gone. The guards had left already and t hey t ook all of the 
food. 

Q: Do you know why t hey had not opened it? The gate? 

A: No. 
Q: Because it seems to me you're saying that it was easy t o open? 
A: Yeah. Yeah. The ot her guy and I lifted it and opened i t and I said m y God, we opened 

it. 

Q: Do you remember t he other guy's name? 

A: No. I've been trying to think of it and I -- I can't remember his name. I remember what 
he looked l ike. 

Q: Careful of the mic.  
A: He was also in Service Company. He -- I don't know whether he was a clerk of some 
sort or -- 

Q: But so you opened the gate and this is when you hear t he man speaking Yiddish? 

A: Well, he -- he started coming out? 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What were your thoughts -- thoughts when you heard t hat? 
A: Well -- 
Q: -- 
"have pity. 
Have" 
-- 
A: Well, just felt, I'm touched, you know, moved. 

Q: The fact that he was speaking Yiddish?  

Insdg
 
A: Yeah and that he was so, so thin. And then he, you know. 
Q: So did you i mmediately decide to go back t o your company? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: 
So you 
-- At that point you are not interacti ng with any of the prisoners? 
A: No, no.  

Q: How long did i t take you to get back to the company, do 
you think?
 
A: Oh, immediately.We turned around and ran back when we saw all of these people. 

Q: And what did you tell your company?What had you just seen? 

A: That we opened a concentration camp and -- 

Q: And what did -- and what did your Œ 
A: Take over. 
Q: Oka y. And what did the y do? 
A: The y di d. As I recal l they went there and they evacuated the prisoners. 

Q: Did you go back wit h them? 

A: With ambulances, you know, t he y got ambulances and the y got -- Yeah, well, I don't -

- I don't  remember too much after that. Where we -- where we were or where we were 

assigned to somet hing else right awa y or... 

Q: So did you ever go 
--
 go back to Mauthausen during that period? 
A: No. 

Q: There was -- there was just that one interaction of, I'm sorry, Gunscarium (sic), that -- 

that one situation where you're opening the gate and then you immedi ately went back to 

the company.So you di d not enter the camp? 

Insdg
 
A: No. 
Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes? 

A: 
Ma ybe, yeah.
 

Q: How many people did you see? 
A: Ma ybe dozens i n the background. 
Q: What was? 

A: It smell ed of death. 

Q: 
Tell me 
-- tell me about the smell? 

A: Just -- it just had an awful smell . 

Q: What was it reminiscent of? 

A: I don't know. Smel l ed bad and people said that's the smell of death? 
Q: Which people? Who said t hat? 
A: Guys i n the Arm y. I just don't remember too much of that. 

Q: 
Wh at
 was the weather like that da y? Was it  raining? 
A: It was not raini ng, no. 

Q: Was it fairly warm by then? Or was it a cold Spring? 
A: I don't remember that. I think i t was fairly -- 
It must

Q: This is a Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lester Libo. 

Insdg
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Conducted by me, by Johanna Newman (ph), on October 25, 2012 in Washington 

D.C., and this interview is being conduct ed over the phone. And now I'm i ntroduci ng 

m yself to you. I understand that you had some interview al ready, part of your interview 
already took place -- 
A: Yes, there was an interview there in Washi ngton.  

Q: Uh-huh, I see, oh, I see, okay. Well, I think -- I hope you're comfortable and si tting 

down Œ 

A: Yes, I am.  

Q: --and relaxing. Okay, very good. Where are you? 

A: I™m in Albuquerque.  
Q: New Mexico? 
A:  New Mexico.  

Q: That™s where you li ve?  

A: Yes.    

Q: Uh-huh, oka y, very good. Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a 

little bit to the original interview what your function was after World War II. How did 

you get involved with the denazification and why were you chosen 
--
 chosen to be part of 
that program? 

A: Well,I was 
-- I was in the infantry -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- and we were in occupation in Augsburg.  

Insdg
 
Q: Oh, yes. 
A: And I was just bored, I guess, and I -- 
and Iheardabout military government needing 

people, so I applied for a transfer and I got i t, and the y transferred me to Regensburg. 

Q: Yes. 
A: And when I went to -- I was put  into Public Safet y Special Branch and it turned out 
that the head of denazification, the enlisted man who was the head, the title is chi ef clerk, 

that he was leaving in a few days. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I had a few years of college credit i n psychology and I guess they thought that -- 

that I could do it. So I was only 22 years old, but I wanted it and they thought I could do 

it, so the y trained me to fill his spot. 
Q: I -- I suppose it was quite a chall enge for you.  
A: Yes, it was. 

Q: Now, what -- how -- now in retrospect, how successful do you think that this program 

worked out?  

A: Well, in our district, which was -- the state of the niederba yern and obersfeldt (ph) 

where Regensburg i s. 

Q: Yes. 
A: We had the highest number of -- of -- what you call it, of screenings, we had the 
highest number of eval uations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than 

anyone else in the U.S. Zone. We had -- we were very successful. 

Q: When you sa y successful, do you think that it had an i mpact on --  

Insdg
 
A: That what? 
Q: -- on the Nazis to -- well, let's sa y nevermind repent, but the y realized finall y how 

wrong the y had gone or how cri minal their government had been or do you think that 

they -- they did this mostly so that they would be spared from trials or prison or worse? 
A: Well, they didn't do it, we did i t, we removed them. We-- we eval uated them. 
Q: Uh-
huh, yeah.
 

A: This was the U.S. government, it wasn't the Germans. 

Q: No, no, I understand, I know that, but I was just wondering -- 

A: We removed them from office Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- in important j obs, like in the government  and in i mportant j obs, -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- administrative jobs and we removed t housands and t hat-- that was our mission, to 

cleanse the new government of -- of Nazis as much as possible at the higher level s. I 

mean at the lower level s there were -- there were many Nazi party members, but we kept 

-- if they were -- if -- if they had joined the party after summer of  '37 they were 

considered oka y.
 

Q: Because then the y were forced? 
A: Yeah. If the y hadn't held any position 
--
 any official positions. 
Q: The reason that you felt that way is because at that poi nt they were forced, whether -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- the y li ked it or not? 

Insdg
 
A: It was mandatory that the y join. 
Q: Right, right. My ques
tion merely 
-- m y next question actually was: Who were t he 

individual s you were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime? So 

in a wa y you have answered that al ready. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah.  You said that they were Œ  
A: Yes. 

Q: -- the y had been in the government?  

A: Right. 

Q: And -- well, and you think that those who went into the party after '37 by -- in their 

hearts they were not Nazis? Do you think 00? 
A: Oh, I don't 
--
 no, it was mixed, I'm sure.  
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: That some believed in it and some were -- didn't and were forced into it, but. 

Q: Now, how do you think -- what was the reaction on the parts of these Germans? The y 

were removed from their office by the Unit ed States mili tary. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And what was t heir reaction to being chosen to be denazified? I assume that some 
were be yond that. In other words, that the y, you know, either ended up in prison or coul d 
not be used -- 

A: Oh, yeah, the ones who -- who were suspected of being war cri mi nals, -- 

Q: Yeah.  

Insdg
 
A:  -- we di dn™t Œ we di dn™t process them. We turned them over to--  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- counter-intelli gence, you know, to intelligence Œ  

Q: I see, yeah. 
A: -- but we didn't deal  with those. 
Q: So you had good reason to thi nk that t he people you were deali ng with, it was 

worthwhile trying to change them Œ  

A: Yes.   

Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: Yeah, it didn't last l ong, though. We understand Œ I understand that it changed about, 

you know -- in 1946, I think it was, late 1946. I was there only unt il Ma y '46. 
Q: Uh-
huh, yes.
 
A: I was there from September to Ma y '46. And we were very-- we were very aggressive 

in pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office. 

Q: Uh-
huh, yeah.
 

A: And some people -- I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't  

worth doing or somethi ng, I don't know. One 
--
 I remember one Nazi party official that 
we removed from office said to me that he had -- he had hi s days of glory and now -- and 
now it's turned over, so, you know, it's -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: It's sort of worth it. 

Q: In what language di d you interrogate these people? How did you deal with the -- 

Insdg
 
A: Well, I had -- I had a German American 
--
 I had an American originally from 
Germany as an interpreter. He was in the Army. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: So he was an interpreter. 
Q: By the way, have you ever come across t he name of a American lawyer by the name 
of Kemp -- not American, German lawyer by t he name of Kempner (ph)? 
A: Kempner?  

Q: Kempner, yeah. 

A: Sounds familiar. 

Q: Because apparent ly he is -- 
was a 
-- 
a 
-- a  l awyer who interrogated also this -- these 
kind of people, people who had been in office, who had -- 
A: Oh, uh- huh. 
Q: -- held government j obs and tryi ng to find out how much did t he y know what  was 

going on --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and were the y in favor of it or not, and so apparently he -- you know, he became 

quite well known. That's ma ybe why the name is familiar to you. Yeah, Kempner was the 

name. He was a German interrogating his own people. 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: Yeah. Oka y. So how -- let's see, di d they honestly cooperate or did the y just want t o 

escape puni shment and, therefore, participated in the program? What would you think? 

Insdg
 
A: No, I -- well, the y were being investigated, the y wanted to get away -- I don't think 
they cooperated. The y were -- 
Q: The y di d not cooperate with the American 
--
 
A: Well, who -- who were you thinking of? The people who were -- 
Q: The people who were supposed to be denazified.  
A: The people who were screened? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, they filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.  

Q: That was m y questi on, too: How honest were the answers or coul d you assess that? 
A: Well, that's an interesting question because a lot of -- many Germans came from the 

east zone. 
Q: Uh-
huh, yeah.
 
A: And there were no records to check on t heir responses, but in our zone, in our area, 

Regensburg itself -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- had an intact record center that  had all the Nazi records. So people from the local 

area we coul d check on, so we had -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- so we had a routine check in the records center Œ  
Q: Uh-
huh, y
eah.
 
A: -- in Regensburg on everybody, but people who came from Poland or East Germany,-- 

Q: Yeah. 

Insdg
 
A: -- whatever, we had no wa y of checking on them, so of course t he y were more sus -- 
they were more suspicious. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you think that some of them reall y -- well, let me ask you this then: How 

did you determine who -- whom to get int o the program? 
A: Who 
-- 
Q: How did you choose the indivi dual that you thought would qualify to be in t he 
program and be denazified? 

A: I -- I don't know. We didn't -- we 
didn't choose.
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Somebody chose.  

Q: I see, uh -huh. 
A: Military government, I don't know. We -- we were -- we were the evaluators, --  
Q: I see, I see. 

A: -- but we didn't do t he initial choice.  

Q: So you were handed a list of people Œ  

A: Yes. 

Q: I see, I understand. And then you did your best to try and get t he Nazi ideology out of 

them, huh? 
A: Not to get the Nazi ideology out of them, but to keep the ones that  were more serious 
Nazis out of -- out of important jobs. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: I mean we didn't expect to change their ideology. 

Insdg
 
Q: And -- 
{coughing} excuse me. Andhowdi d you 
-- you were a young person, as you 
mentioned earlier.
 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden? I mean i n a wa y from a human 
point of view this is quite a -- a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebody's 
future in a wa y. 

A: Not at al l, it was a j oy.  

Q: Oh, oka y. 

A: I was gl ad to do it. It was revenge. 

Q: Well, that I can understand, right. Now, how was the 
--
 
A: I was -- you know, I'm Jewi sh.  
Q: I know, I know. 
A: So I -- you know, I saw that as a -- as a good kind of revenge. 

Q: I see, uh -huh. And 
--
 well, oka y. 
A: My interpreter was also Jewish, he was -- he was a German Jewish refugee who was 

in the Arm y. 

Q: Yeah. Well, many of them came Œ  
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- at an age here to America and then enlisted in the Arm y, that's right. 
A: Right. 

Q: You know I come from that part of the world, too.  

A: You came from 
--
 

Insdg
 
Q: I'm originally from -- from Hamburg.  
A: Oh, yeah? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, that's in the north. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, what  was the procedure, was this program conducted on a 
one -- one-
on
-one basis or did you have groups at the same time, and how exactly did you 
proceed in this proj ect, in this program of denazification? 

A: Well, we had the fragebogens.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And the y would come in, and the y would have to be evaluated. 

Q: Right. 
A: And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people. 
Q: Oh, I see, uh-
huh, yeah.
 

A: And there were -- 
they went
 over them and -- and the y would come to me and say thi s 

one looks suspici ous or this one, you know, and so on, but the y would -- there were -- 

there were procedures to follow. 

Q: I see, okay.  

A: And -- 
Q: So you followed a protocol, in other words?  
A: Y
eah.
 

Insdg
 
Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay. But then -- and then let's say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 
of these individuals. Was it conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one-

to-one basi s?  

A: No, one -to-one. 
Q: It was one-to-one? 
A: Well, each -- each questionnaire was Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- was a 
--
 it was a separate investigation, a separate procedure for each indivi dual. 
Q: I see. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What was the procedure? 
A: The procedure was to evaluate t heir questionnaire and t o come up with a rating in -- 
there were five categories. 

Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: You know, you know those five categories: Number one is mandatory removal, 

number two is -- is discretionary adverse recommendation, number three is discretionary 

no recommendation, number four is no evidence of anti -- no evidence of Nazi activity, 

and number five was evidence of anti-
Nazi activity.
 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: And so each individual would get a rati ng.  

Q: Yeah. 

Insdg
 
A: That would be the conclusion. And then if the y were in the four or five, they would be 
removed from office or not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their 

property could be seized and used by the Allies, by the Americans for, you know, like 

homes coul d be used for troops. 
Q: Uh-huh, yeah. And how long did such a process take?  
A: The evaluation process? 

Q: Yes, uh -huh. 

A: Just -- just -- it  was -- I don't know, I woul d sa y anywhere from an hour to a couple of 

d ays.
 
Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: It depended on if there were any complicat ions, because we also had a special 
investigati ons unit  that would look into difficult case -- cases that were, you know, harder 
to figure out. 

Q: Right, right, uh-huh. 

A: The y -- you know, they might 
--
 they might go to -- to interrogate some other people 
or try to get  other records or whatever. 

Q: Uh-huh. Or did you interview members of their family or -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- I don™t know what Œ uh-huh.  
A:  No.  

Q: Or friends or Œ  

Insdg
 
A: either. Most -- t he action in most cases was taken on the basis of the questionnaire 
alone. 

Q: Uh-huh, I see. 

A: We would bring them in for interviews if we had questions. 
Q: I see, I see. Oh, you mean you got the fragebogen, that you evaluat ed, but you didn't 
necessarily have the individual in front of you? 

A: That's right. 

Q: Uh-huh, I see. I didn't realize that. Now I suppose I had a -- I had a different concept 

somewhat. I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who 

was suspicious or wasn't suspi cious, that they somehow got some kind of a -- I do
n't want 

to call it brainwashi ng, but some kind of a, you know, democratic viewpoint or 
--
 or --  
A: Oh, no, no. No, it was strictly Œ  
Q: Based on their fragebogen. 

A: It was, yeah, stri ctly screening, no attempt t o change them or argue with them. 

Q: And were the y cooperative, were the y hosti le, antagoni stic or --  

A: Well, I would sa y the main attit ude was to t ry t o get out of it, you know, to sa y that 

they were innocent. 

Q: Oh -- 
A: "Nicht Nazi, Ni cht Nazi" was 
--
 was their motto. There was one case -- -  
Q: Well, that was easy to sa y afterwards. 
A: There was one case I remember where this man said that-- that he understands that the 

tables were t urned and he had his days of glory and now his side has lost and he's 

Insdg
 
prepared to t ake the consequences, and he -- you know, he said well, we had our da y and 
now you have your day.Well, that was very unusual. 

Q: Uh-huh, to admit that?  

A: For anybody to do that. Most of them wereŠ made excuses. You know, they said they 
were forced or that they were not really a Nazi and so on. And of course the people from 
-- who came from East Germany, t here was no wa y to check. 

Q: That's the other big problem, exactly, ri ght. So I was-- one of the questions I had in 

m y mind was: Was any material used during t his process, but I guess it wasn't 'cause I 

had a different concept of it at all. 

A: Right. 

Q: I thought there were lectures bei ng given on democrac y or lectures -- 
A: Oh, no. There was no attempt t o change anybody. It was completely screening. 
Q: Uh-huh. And get the least suspicious back into the workforce? 

A: The what? 

 

Q: I said and then t o get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force? 

A: Yeah, to -- well, to allow them to conti nue in their -- on their jobs. 

Q: Yeah, yeah.  
A: Or to be hired.    

Q: Yeah, I understand, yeah. Oka y. Let's see now, what qualifications did you have or 

required in order to be part of this process? Well, you sai d that -- 

Insdg
 
A: Well,I was 
-- I was a college student, I was a psychology maj or, and I also had 
experienceworking in personne
l administration. 
Q: I see, oh, I see. 

A: So I had administrat ive experience. 
Q: I see. And were you in charge of the -- of t his particul ar program? 
A: Yes, I was -- well, I was an enli sted man, I was a sergeant. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The person in charge of the whole thing was an officer, a captain. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And he -- and there was also a lieutenant, so I remember there were two American 

officers that were in charge, but the da y-to- day work was done by -- the da y-to-da y work 
of -- of being in charge, I mean, -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- was done by an enlisted man.  

Q: I see. 

A: And m y predecessor was the one who was being discharged. He was also a Jewish 

g uy 
Œ 

Q: Yeah 
A: -- from t he States. And I was put in to learn Œ learn the ropes.  
Q: I see, yeah. 

A: And learn the job Œ  

Q: Uh-huh. 

Insdg
 
A: -- that he did heading up the staff, supervisi ng the staff. 
Q: I see. So you were in a supervi sory position? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah.  
A: The title was chi ef clerk. 
Q: I see, good, very good. Were there Germans that participated under oath?  

A: Germans -- 

Q: Well, let 's sa y those who filled out the fragebogen -- fragebogen, and was there 

anywhere where they had to, I don't know, sign that -- like we sa y here in the United 

States -- 

A: I think 
--
 I think -- 
Q: You know, to whatever I wrote t hat -- 

A: I think t he y signed i t -- I think they -- when the y signed it it said -- it probably said in 

there that something about -- 

Q: But the y were not under any verbal oath or anything like that? 

A: No. 

Q: Well, they -- I think they got awa y wit h too much, qui te honestly, but never mind. 

Well, that was anot her question I had: How could you be sure that what they put down i n 
their fragebogen was an honest answer? But I think you answered that already and you 
could -- 

A: The record center. 

Q: Yeah. You could check it unless they came from the east? 

Insdg
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. Well, that's, of course, a big probl em, but -- and that I guess wasn't really 

eliminated until the '90s, right, when they got records. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: What di d you hope to achieve with this denazification program? 
A: Cleansing. Well, to keep the new Germany, the new German government more 

democratic, and not -- not back in the hands of the Nazis. 

Q: And do you thi nk you succeeded? 

A: We succeeded in 
--
 in our job, but we understand that the new German government 
kind of weakened and we had heard that Nazi s were being kept or hi red again. 

Q: And that was under Adenauer or Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Well, I guess you were dealing here with what, 52 million people or however many -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you told me already where you were located, right? In -- 
in Regensburg 
Œ   
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- or where was -- 

A: Regensburg on the... 
Q: Oka y. And that 's where -- where your work was concentrated, i n that part of Bavaria? 
A: Yes. 

Q: How long did you work in thi s capacity? 

A: I was there from September of  '45 through Ma y of  '46.  

Insdg
 
Q: At the ti me that I was in a DP camp in Ital y. 
A: Oh. 

Q: Beyond that even, until August, I guess, of '46. Okay. What  were some of the most 

memorable incident s that you remember from that period? You already told me about the 
guy who said you had your da y -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I mean we had our day, now you have your day. I'm sure you came across a number of 

other memorable incidents with these people. 

A: Well, I t hink one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest 

number of removals in the whole US zone. 

Q: Uh-huh. The hi ghest removal?  
A: Yeah. 
Q: That's interesting. 

A: Yeah, the highest number. 

Q: Well, Bavaria is sort of Hitler country Œ  

A: Oh. 

Q: -- perhaps that 's why.  

A: Uh-huh. 
Q: Munich, that 's part of it.  
A: Also, we had heard -- 

Q: Yeah. 

Insdg
 
A: -- that the British were sitting and havi ng tea with the Nazis, and t hat the French, I 
don't know -- t he French were either very vengeful or just didn't care, but that the United 

States forces were the most serious about denazification, so we were proud that we were 

doing a good job. 
Q: Uh-huh, oka y. But specifically on a one-
to
- one from an individual, do you have any 
memorable incident s that occurred with, you know, you speaking to any of these people 
or in conversation or -- 

A: I don't -- I don't remember any specific. 

Q: I see. Now, you think that the program was effective? 

A: Well, it was effective while we were doing it, but it was -- but  it was overturned; you 

know, it was watered down and then it was done away with. 
Q: How soon would you think was it watered down? I think that reall y i s also an 
important point because was there already a new younger generati on coming in or -- 

A: No, not  while we were there. It was after -- we heard that it was done afterward, 

probably in late '46. 

Q: What, that the y over turned this program?  

A: That's what I heard. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.Were any other highlights that you remember duri ng this peri od? I 
mean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this wa y? I assume that 
perhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some -- 

A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: Anybody specific? 

Insdg
 
A: No, I can't remember any -- 
any big 
-- bi g name.  
Q: Yeah, I mean real ly big shots. 
A: No, I don't think so. 

Q: Oka y. What about 
--
 or how was it justified that some of the Nazis scientists, etcetera, 
ended up here? 

A: Oh, I don't know. I don't know anything about that. I guess the United States needed 

them. 

Q: Or the y would have fallen into the hands of the -- of the -- of the other side. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you think -- well, let me ask you thi s: What are some of the strengths or 

weaknesses of this program? 
A: Well, I t hink -- t he weakness was not having record centers -- not having records on 
people who came from other areas. 

Q: Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right. 

A: Other than that, I think it was done very well.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, and they were serious and peopl e were removed and gradually jobs were -- 

were given t o people who were not  Nazis. There weren't many 
--
 there weren't many 
around, you know. There was -- practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of 

the mandat ory membership 
--  
Q: Right --  

A: -- from '37 on. 

Insdg
 
Q: {Coughing} excuse me. No, that I realize and that, of course, very difficult to make 
this distinction and then to be sure that -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah, very difficult. Did you -- were you able to -- to obtain li sts of Nazi party 
members? 
A: As I recall, there was one time when -- when somebody uncovered a record or a list of 

-- of -- of members that we could check agai nst -- against our applicants.  It was kind of 

a surprise treasure that was uncovered. 

Q: I can imagine, yeah.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: And probably to the great disappoint ment of some of the peopl e -- 
A: Yeah, ri ght. 
Q: There you had it black and white, huh?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. I had a question of how were the candidates for denazification chosen? 

A: It was a routine thing on their j ob. It was because of what -- 
what position 
-- I guess -- 
I guess it was, you know, everybody in certain jobs in the government or in i mportant 

positions in society. 
Q: That you really needed in order to -- 
A: We didn't -- we didn't select them, the y were -- 
we recei ved 
-- we received them, 

somebody else selected them. 

Insdg
 
Q: Made the selection. When you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies, 
not from within the Germans themselves? 

A: I guess so. I don't -- I don't really know. It might be t hat an order went in from military 

government  that everybody in a certain indust ry had to submit a fragebogen. 
Q: I see, okay, uh-huh. So really everything, all the -- all the selecti on, and I hate t o use 
that word for obvious reasons, but  let's -- let 's just use it for lack of a better word, so all 

the selections were real l y based ent irely on the fragebogen? 

A: On -- all the selection? 

Q: Yeah, who was going to be denazified or not. 

A: Oh. Well, it started with the fragebogen. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Then if there were questions or suspicions, then -- then there woul d be interviews and 
further investigations. 

Q: Did you do some of the interviews yourself as well?  

A: Did what? 

Q: Did you do personall y some of the interviews yourself or Œ 

A: No. We had an American GI ori ginally from Germany who was a special investigator 

and he would -- he would do them. 
Q: He would do the -- 
A: Interviews. And he -- and he would do the -- he would do further i nvestigation. 
Q: I see. So really was a whole team work?  

A: Oh, yeah, absol utel y. 

Insdg
 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Now, the -- the workload must have been overwhelming, as we sai d 
before, dealing with a whole nation? 

A: Well, we only had one state. 

Q: Now, did this 
--
 that's a good answer because that brings me t o another questi on. Di d 
you 
-- did the United States have such programs all over Germany? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yes. It was in t he -- the whole US zone Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- was divided i nto areas and all of them had the same kind of thi ng we did.  

Q: I see, I see. 
A: Wewere just 
-- we were just in one state.  
Q: You're just the -- the -- 
A: Niederba yern and obersfeldt. 

Q: Niederba yern, yeah. Oh, I see. This really was a very well organized undertaking. 

A: Oh, yes. 

Q: I mean -- so what would you sa y, roughly how many people i n your sector, on your 

section were involved i n this? Germans, I mean. 
A: Oh, I -- the populati on?  
Q: Yeah. 

A: I don't -- 
Idon't know.A million. 
 

Q: Oh, really? 

Insdg
 
A: I don't know. I don't  remember. 
Q: Well, it was a vast undertaking. And you -- 
you 
-- you talk about the Americans 
having done that, and I was not aware of that either that -- that this was not an all ied 

undertaking. I always was under the impression that thi s was a cooperati ve undertaking. 
A: No, thi s was American. 

Q: I see. And the ot her -- 

A: And the others had t heir own systems. 

Q: Uh-huh. Did the y also call it denazification? 

A: I don't think so.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I don't know what they had. I mean we 
--
 we had heard that -- 
that 
-- that the British 
were having tea wit h the Nazis and the French were just wrecking t hei r stores and homes. 

Q: So not -- not -- 

A: Oh, and the Russians were terrible, you know.  

Q: Yeah, I know that. 

A: Everybody ran away from th
e Russians 
Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and said that t he y were monsters.  
Q: Right. Now that I heard -- 
A: Because they were so -- the y were so vengeful Œ  

Q: Right, even from -- 

A: -- at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia. 

Insdg
 
Q: And also a lot of Russians died because of that. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. So let me ask you this: What would you say, how-- how did this experience 

affect you as a young person in such a responsible position, you know, which involved 
really i mpacting the course of people's lives? Were you aware of your power, were you 
troubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area? 

A: No, actually, I t hink it matured me. I enj oyed it. We lived well. I mean we had -- we 

had a hotel room, we had a Œ we had -- we 
--
 you know, we lived in a hotel, we had 
dances, we had an orchestra, we had a bar, we -- I had a girlfriend. We had a chauffeur to 

go wherever we wanted to, like to a pla y or an opera or concert. It was -- it was a very 

educational experience.
 
Q: I see. 

A: I mean I was -- I was so young. I had 
--
 I had three years of college credit, which I had 
done in two years. 

Q: Uh-
huh, yeah.
 

A: And so, you know, 
--
 
Q: Did you pursue that psychology at the end?  

A: Yes, I went on and got a PhD in psychology. 
Q: Very nice, lovely. Wel l, so you're telling me that so close after the war ended, this 
horrible war, the y had already concert, theater, opera, dances -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- and everything el se?  

Insdg
 
A: Yep. 
Q: I guess people are very resilient.  

A: Yes. 

Q: Well 
-- 
A: Well, Regensburg wasn't -- wasn't 
wrecked as muchas someother cities.
 
Q: I know, I know. Hamburg was destroyed, 75 percent. 

A: Oh, yeah, bombing. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. And were you -- well, you said you enjoyed it, so I assume you enjoyed 

the feeling of having power over these people? 

A: Well,
 it wasn't that, it was just having an i mportant job. 

Q: Important job, t oo. 
A: And having a lot of the luxuries of -- of, you know, living well. 
Q: Right, right, right. 

A: I mean t here were al so the problems of being away from home and living in 
--
 still 
living in a hostile environment. I mean we weren't -- you know, it was dangerous to walk 

down the streets al one at night. 

Q: You just asked -- you just answered m y next question, which really was How 

dangerous or how hosti le were these people against the -- well, the allies in general but 
the United States Arm y soldiers that were i n -- 
A: Well, they were -- t here were alwa ys stories about an attack. You know, there were -- 

there were German Arm y veterans, was Hitler Youth former members, there were true 

believers. There were stories that t here were at tacks on GIs and -- but I don't remember 

Insdg
 
that anybody in our uni t was attacked, but 
--
 but we were alwa ys careful. I mean I 
remember walk -- walking down t he street  m yself at night, like if I took m y girlfriend 
home, and t hen I woul d walk back to my hotel, I would carry a knife. 

Q: I see. So one real ly did need a l ittle bit of protection after all. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You were not welcomed with open arms? 

A: Oh, no. Although many of them acted that way.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. Well -- 

A: Oh, yeah, they acted that wa y. 

Q: Well, it probably netted them some chocol ate and nylon stockings and other t hings. 

A: That's right, and they were glad the war was over.  
Q: Yeah. Well, that's for sure. 
A: And cigarettes were very i mportant, cigaret tes and chocolate and stockings, yeah. 

Q: What days these were, oh, my God. I remember them quite well st ill. Well, I had a 

question whether, you know, you had to follow a protocol in thi s process or whether it 

was, you know, partiall y your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not 

honest, etcetera? What guided your -- your work more, the protocol that you had to 

follow or the insti nct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen?  
A: Probably both. You know, for instance if there was a contradicti on in dates or 
functions or -- see I -- I didn't 
--
 I wasn't an evaluator m yself, I was the head of the unit, 
so the evaluator would come to me with a question. They would sa y here's -- here's a 

Insdg
 
fragebogen where thi s guy answers this and this place and that on that place and i t looks 
like a contradiction and so on, so they would come to me with questions. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: But the y woul d -- they would do the evaluations, I wouldn't, but I would train them. 
Q: I see, uh -huh. Now, another question just came to m y mind. Most of Germany was 
mobilized i nto the Army. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And these peopl e that you dealt  with were people who were holdi ng office jobs or -- 

or were working for the government in a -- in a different capacit y. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Not in t he Arm y.  
A: Right. 
Q: How did they -- how did the y manage to stay out of the Arm y? 

A: I -- I have no idea. 

Q: But these guys, in ot her words, had -- that you were deal ing wit h had not been in -- in 

the military inthe Wehrnacht?
 
A: I'm 
--
 I don't know. I think some were -- 
some werein both.
 
Q: I see. 
A: Civilian and had been in the Arm y too.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I don't know. I think they were i n the Army and then they were 
--
 t his was peace ti me. 
Q: Well,justafew months, yeah, they may havebeen 
Œ  

Insdg
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- demobilized by that ti me? 

A: Right. So ma ybe the records show that t he y were in the Nazi party and then the y were 

in the Arm y and now they were out in a job and the y were being screened in the job. 
Q: Now, how often did you come across or di d the y honestly -- 
A: How what? 

Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that  he was a member of 

th e SS?
 
A: Oh, nobody. 

Q: Nobody, I see. 

A: No. We didn't come -- we didn't come across many SS. I thi nk they were picked up by 
other intelligence. Ma ybe they were picked up before -- before they got to us. 
Q: I see. 

A: I don't remember many -- I don't remember many SS members. 
Q: I see. 

A: I remember some SR members -- 

Q: Yeah. Well, that was the forerunner.  

A: Sturmabteilung. 
Q: Well, they were t he forerunners to the SS actually, I guess. 
A: Yeah, they were the brown shirts. 

Q: Yeah, the beginning of the whole business.  

A: Yeah. 

Insdg
 
Q: Oka y. How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position, to work with Nazis 
and trying to sort of get them back on a normal footing on the -- on the non-Nazi l ifestyle 

or non-Nazi  outlook. 

A: Well,I was 
-- 
I was certainly motivated.
 
Q: As a Jew. 

A: Yes. I was glad to pay them back.  

Q: Right. 

A: And I was glad to see justice being done.  

Q: What happened, by the wa y, to those people that were fired from t heir jobs and did not 

-- could not  be re-empl oyed in -- i nto the government?  

A: Yeah, that's a good question, I don't know. We -- we al wa ys wondered about t hat, 
what happened to them. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Ma ybe t he y -- they j ust did some -- some ki nd of business by themselves. 

Q: Well, this was -- Germany has alwa ys been a big bureaucratic -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- struct ure, but Œ 

A: Ma ybe t his went int o some kind of business or got jobs in a business where -- 
Q: But you don't -- you don't know what Œ  
A: No. 

Q: I mean unless t he y ended up in prison. I suppose some of these people had a record or 

-- a record came to li ght -- 

Insdg
 
A: Well 
-- 
Q: -- where they actual l y 
--
 
A: The y weren't imprisoned. The y -- I mean some of them lost their homes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And -- 
Q: Well, you said t he y -- their finances were --  

A: Yeah, their bank account was frozen. The y were allowed to take out just like $200 a 

month, something like that. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The y were punished.  

Q: Not enough. 
A: No. 
Q: Not enough, but what can you do. You could have taken a whole nation and cut them 

off from the member of the world l ike Mr. Morgenthau you wanted to do? 

A: By the way, I wanted to ask you Œ  

Q: Yes. 

A: -- kind of a far out question.  

Q: That's oka y. 
A: I have written a novel based on my experience there.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It's called The Finishing Touch.  

Q: Yeah. 

Insdg
 
A: And it 's about the nazification, and it has a love story woven in and out of it, but, you 
know, it 's about an Am erican who falls in love with a German woman and the German 

woman has two brothers, one of whom was in the -- notorious Nazi and the -- and one -- 

one died, and the one who was the Nazi takes on the identity of the one who died and 
tries to pass as the one who died and so there i s this intri gue about who -- which 
--
 which 
brother is t his -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and trying to trace and find out so on. It's a suspense novel. And I would l ike to find 

a publisher or an agent for it. 

Q: Uh-huh. Oh, m y goodness. That is very very intrigui ng. You did that in recent years? 

A: I just wrote it. I just finished it. 
Q: How lovely. That's really quite an undert aki ng. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Well, that's alwa ys very, very difficult to find a publisher, but  I suppose you could 

approach a number of, you know, known publishers and send them the manuscript. I 

guess that's how you go about it Œ  
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- or you can go through some of the universities publish books. 
A: Yeah, right. 
Q: But I don't know whether -- you know, as a novel, but it's really a historic novel, I 

assume? 

A: Yeah, it 's a historical novel. It 's all about the kinds of things t hat we talked about. 

Insdg
 
Q: Right. Oka y. So possibly some of the universities might be interest ed. I mean you 
have to start somewhere and usually, you know, one person gives you an idea and 

another person and eventually you ma y -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- find somebody who does -- sounds fascinating to me. 
A: Well, it's related Holocaust museum, that's why I asked you. 

Q: We don't do any publishing. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: We don't do any publishing.  

A: Oh, I see. 

Q: We have a book steward that sells novels and mostly authenti c stories about the 
Holocaust 
--
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- but these are all published books, but we do not -- we in the museum do not publi sh 

books, but  you -- 

A: Oh, by the wa y, when I was in the infantry, we had opened -- 
we hadopened a 
concentration camp as -- I was in Patton's Army as we swept across France, Germany and 

Austria and it was al most like a different town every-- every da y t he advance was so fast 
-- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but we-- we came upon a Mauthausen.  

Q:Oh, yeah, yeah.
 

Insdg
 
A: And our unit opened one of the camps of Mauthausen.  
Q: Oh. You mean one of the subcamps? 

A: Subcamps, right.  

Q: Yeah, uh-huh. 
A: And that was interesting. 
Q: I bet. And you found survivors there?  

A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. Lots of peopl e were -- were there and we opened the gat es and the y streamed 

out -- 

Q: Mauthausen, was that Œ 
A: Some dropped dead.  
Q: -- in Austria or was that in Germany?  

A: Pardon? 

Q: Mauthausen, was on the German side or Austrian? 

A: I think i t was -- I thought it was German.  

Q: Could be, I'm not sure. 

A: I mean our unit went farther west -- 
I mean farthereast 
-- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- than any other. 

Q: So how long were you in the Arm y? 

A: We met the Russians near Styer, Austri a. I was in the Arm y for three years.  

Insdg
 
Q: You enl isted or you -- 
A: Yeah, I enlisted. I enlisted in '41 Œ  

Q: After Pearl Harbor. 

A: -- and then they had a program where you could sta y i n college.  
Q: Oh, oh, I see, uh-huh. 
A: And so I didn't -- actually didn't go in unti l '43. 

Q: I see, I see. Well, those were the worst years, I guess. 

A: '43 and '46. And then I was -- I was put  in t he infantry. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: 
So  
-- but I was -- I was put in classification, so I was the head of the classification part 

of the infantry regi ment, which is a personnel, so -- 
Q: So you saw a lot of battle though? 
A: A lot of what? 

Q: Battle. I mean active warfare.  

A: I saw a lot of what? 

Q: Of active warfare, of battles.  

A: Warfare?
 
Q: Yeah. I mean you were in the trenches, so t o sa y? 
A: Oh, yeah, yeah, right. No, I saw a lot, but I was not in -- I was not actually in t he front 
line. I was i n service -- service company, which is -- which is in 
--
 it's an infantry 
regi ment, but it's -- 
but  it's 
-- it's -- it's t he clerks and the drivers and the supply people -- 
Q: I see, okay. 

Insdg
 
A: -- and so on, so we were -- we were a littl e behind. We were not i n -- in the foxholes. 
Q: I see. Did you -- you had a staff that worked with you, yeah? 

A: In -- 
in denazification? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Oh, yeah. 
Q: How large a staff would you sa y did you have?  

A: Oh, there were 35 people altogether. 

Q: I see, uh -huh. And you were the -- you were the supervisor -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- of these 35 people? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. And they had to report back to you of their findings, --  
A: Yes. 

Q: -- 
etcetera? 
 
A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. And who were the y mostly, the y Œ  

A: The y were mostly Germans and DPs. 

Q: Oh, I see. Not t he American soldiers?  
A: There were -- there were a few American soldiers, but they were not the evaluators. 
The evaluators were all  German speaking. 

Q: I see. 

A: And -- 

Insdg
 
Q: So the y were Germans out of the population of Germany? 
A: Some -- 
some
 were Germans and some were DPs from -- from other countries. 
Q: But spoke German?  

A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. And DPs, also Jewish DPs? 
A: There were a few, but most of the DPs were not Jewish.  

Q: I see, uh -
huh. Well, that'sinteresting.
 
A: There were a few -- I remember t here was a Polish -- couple of Pol ish Jews, t here 

were a couple that were in concentration cam ps, and then there were others that were 

hidden or escaped, but the majority were not Jewish, but there were some Jews. 

Q: How long do you -- would you say that this whole program last? 
A: Well, as I understand -- as I understand, it didn't last much longer after I left. That 
somehow with the new government the y changed the thi ng, ma ybe the whole program 

lasted a year or a year and a half. 

Q: I see. So that's not very -- no, I --  excuse m e. I remember as a teenager hearing about 

this -- papers were full of this denazification, denazification, but I don't think that we ever 

had really a concept of what that really involved. I think perhaps, maybe only in m y own 

mind, I thought that really was kind of a -- how shall I sa y, yeah, a curriculum, that's 
probably the right wa y of -- 
A: Oh, uh- huh. 

Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these people's outlook. 

A: Oh, no.  

Insdg
 
Q: But you're t elling m e now that t his was not it at all.  
A: No, it was never -- it was never like that . 

Q: I see. 

A: It was political screening.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Cleansing of job holding. But I think they 
--
 I think they let Nazis back in because 
they needed them. 

Q: The y di d. 

A: The y needed thei r job skills. And also the whole scientific and technical Œ  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- development. 
Q: And then you had the scientists that the y needed.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: What were the dynamics between your team members? 

A: And?  

Q: No, I said the dynamics between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or 

whatever, yeah, especi all y in view of what you just told me that there were DP people 

and there were Germans and then there was the Arm y, so how di d all that work?  
A: It was --  it was fine. I mean everybody worked together, everybody seemed to -- 
everybody got along -- 

Q: Even -- 

A: Everybody had stori es to tell about their own hardships. 

Insdg
 
Q: Well, that I would believe, yeah. Do you remember some of those stories or some of 
those hardships that people were talking about ? 

A: Well, as I said, a couple were in concentration camps.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: Some, you know, had to leave their homes and travel --escaped, were in hiding for 
many years.
 
Q: Right. 

A: No, I -- as I recall , everybody got along fine. There were no frictions. 

Q: Even among the people who were in the concentration camp and t he Germans that 

they were -- 

A: Well, the Germans on our staff were anti- Nazis.  
Q: Yeah, that I can understand, sure. 
A: So that was okay. 

Q:  Uh-huh. But among themselves they got al
ong, you say? 
 

A:  Yeah. Seems to me they got along fine. I don't know.  

Q: I mean you did not notice any frictions? 

A: No. 

Q: Uh-huh. Well, I guess ma ybe t he y were all out to do t he same thing. 
A: Yeah, exactly. No, we were all doing an important j ob, we -- we realized that, and it 
was -- it was Nazi hunting, and, you know, somebody would find a fragebogen that 

would have a contradiction in it or show something or -- or some -- 
something would 

come up from the record center showing that somebody t hat we had screened turned out 

Insdg
 
to be an i mportant Nazi  office holder, the y would come i nto my office and hold it up like 
victory. Yeah, look what we found.  

Q: I can imagine, yeah.  

A: That was -- those were the high spots was discovering somebody who had been 
cheati
ng or finding a -- 
Q: Do you -- well, I can imagine that that was regarded as a major vi ctory.  
A: Yes. 

Q: Well, I don't  know whatever we -- we try t o do, I hope we accomplished this in some 

way or other. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Was thi s an emotional situation for you?  
A: Yeah, somewhat, I guess. 
Q: As an American or as a Jew? 

A: Well, m yfamily didnot 
-- 
m y 
--
 m y parent s and grandparents did not come from 
Germany, they had 
--
 
t hey had 
-- t he y were American i mmigrants, they came from 
Russia. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And the y came a lot  earlier, so t he y were not affected by what was going on in 
Germany with Hitler. But everybody, of course, was very involved and very interested 
and cared a lot about what was happening in Germany, so m y -- m y work there in 

mil itary government was -- was hi ghly respected. 

Q: I can imagine, yeah. That I can i magine.Well, I -- 

Insdg
 
A: But the strange thing was that it didn't last very long and that 
--
 you know, within a 
year after I was out -- 
Q: There was -- 

A: -- it went back i nto German hands. 
Q: Yeah. That's really t oo bad. I di dn't -- must  confess that I did not realize it, but then at 
that point I had come to the United States Œ 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- and I guess, you know, your -- you start a new life and a new l anguage and a new 

everything, and somehow you leave these horrible events of the past behind. 

A: Is your name Johanna?  

Q: Yes. 
A: So how old are you?  
Q: Right now I'm 81. 

A: Oh, oka y. I'm 89.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Oh, so you -- yeah, so you came to the Stat es then, huh?  

Q: 1946 -- 

A: Oh, uh- huh. 
Q: -- after the war.  
A: Same as me.
 
Q: But you grew up here, I didn't.  

A: Yeah, right. 

Insdg
 
Q: My parents had the good fortune of finding -- 
A: No, we knew -- you know, in t he States during the '30s we knew German Jewish 

refugees. 

Q: Some of them came early, they were smart.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Well, m y parent s found out that Albania all owed Jews to come in and that's where we 

went and that's where we survived the war? 

A: Albania?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Oh. 

Q: Yeah. But, you know, the Germans occupi ed that country as well in 1943. 
A: Yeah, ri ght. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, but the Albania people were exemplary among the nations of saving -- 

A: The y were what? 

Q: The y were exemplary among the nations of saving Jews and not handing them over 

and not -- 

A: Oh, that's i nteresting.  

Q: Uh-
huh, yeah.
 
A: That's good. 
Q: Yeah. Yes, it is, and it's not  much known, not well known at al l. And in fact, you 

know, I speak in many places, in schools, etcet era, to talk about that part of history. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Insdg
 
Q: And it 's real ly i mportant that people have to know.  
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: That's why I want my novel to be published.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, I wanted to ask you, this i nterview is going to be on -- is going to be on a 

CD -- on a CD or something?  

Q: I believe so, but  I Œ  

A: Because -- 

Q: This is actually the first ti me that the y have asked me to do an i nterview, you are my 

guinea pig, and -- so I really don't know the exact correct answer to your question. I 
believe it 's going to be on a DVD, yes. 
A: Because we -- yeah, because we wanted, the family wanted a -- wanted a DVD.  

Q: Yeah, I'm going to ask the young lady who talked to you earlier and who interviewed 

you the first ti me -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- 
whether, you know 
-- whether this will be on a DVD and whether the y can send it to 
you.
 
A: Oka y, wonderful. 

Q: But I think it 's certainl y going to be here in the museum in the All History 

Department. 

A: Oh, good. 

Insdg
 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  
A: Well, that's an honor. 

Q: That's a big aim right now, to get as many survivors and etcetera, you know, 

interviewed before it's t oo late. But I can ask t hat question right now because the young 
lady just walked in, so hold on one minute, please. 
A: Oka y. 

(Inaudible conversation.)  

Q: You will be sent a copy.  

A: Oh, good, wonderful.
