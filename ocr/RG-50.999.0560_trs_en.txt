points  to Romania.
 
 
Near Ias i, s hown on this  m ap, Nathan's  fam ily owned a dair y farm. In 1941, the fas c is t Iron 
Guar d c onfis c ated the farm and all the c attle becaus e Nathan's  family was  J ewis h. The family moved to 

a neighbor hood of Ias i, wher e Nathan's  father, Anton, was  able to k eep cows  and his  m other, Fany, 
bar ter ed dairy pr oduc ts in exc hange for  tutor ing for the c hildr en.
 
 
When Anton was  s ent to perform for c ed labor  in ear ly 1944, 8
-
year

r eturned to his  fam ily. The Spitzers  would s tay in Romania for  s ever al more year s  befor e imm igr ating to 
Is r ael.
 
          
 
After m oving to the United States  in 1961, Nat got a job as a dental tec hnician with plans to be

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nat, thank  you s o m uc h for your willingnes s  to m eet with us  today and be our Fir st 
Pers on. We're very glad to have you and your  fam ily members  that ar e with us today as well.
 
 
Nat, you were not yet 3 when Ger many invaded Poland in September
 
1939, starting World 
War II. Let's  begin the c onver s ation, fir s t, with you telling us  a little bit about your family, your  
c om m unity, your  life befor e the war  began in Septem ber
 
1939. 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Ok. Both of m y par ents c am e from a small village in the eas tern part of Hungar y. My 
m other  was  the oldes t of 12 c hildr en and my father was  the youngest of s ix.
 
 
In 1924, about a year  after Wor ldWar I, m y father  and two of his  older brothers dec ided to 
em igr ate to Romania and they opened up a large dairy farm. Ar ound 1931, my father dec ided it's  time 
for him to get m ar ried. He went back to that little village that he c am e from , bec aus e us ually in thos
e 
days  you m arr ied s om ebody that you knew. And two fam ilies , m y father 's fam ily and my m other's  
family, knew eac h other s o the mos t logic al thing to do was  to marry som ebody within that fam ily. My 
father got m arr ied in 1931. After the wedding, he br ought my mother  back  to Ias i, the area that he lived. 
And befor e long, three childr en wer e born. There were two girls and a boy, and I'm that boy.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you're that boy. 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The dairy farm that your parents  had,
 
who were their pr imar y c us tom er s ?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  There was  the Romanian Arm y, they produc ed all the dairy produc ts for the Rom anian 
Army.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your mother, s he lost her mom when s he was  quite young and took on immens e 

r es pons ibilities . Tell 
us  a little bit about that.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Her m om died at bir th with her 10th c hild. Then her father rem arr ied later on and two 
m or e c hildr en c am e, and s he actually bec ame the mother for all of thes e children.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She was a m other at age 13
. 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Age 13, s tarted age 11 to 13 s he was  the mother of thes e c hildren.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about the c om munity you lived in. I think it was  Buc ium ?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. It's a small town. It's  a farm area. We lived ther e for many, many year s . My father 
got along with all 
the local farm er s, the
 
gentile farm er s. He als o helped them many tim es . When there 
were dr oughts, for ins tance, he always  us ed to give them  s eeds  for the next year's  crop. He always 
was  ready to help other
 
farmers.
 
 
Als o, one of our  neighbor s  was  the pr iest of the town. And he would c ome by onc e a week to 
as k  for  a donation to the c hur c h and als o for s ome dairy pr oducts  for his  paris hioner s , c ongr egates who 
c ould not affor d.

> > Bill Bens on:  I think you desc r ibed life to me as modes t but your needs wer e m et. You didn't have 
elec tr ic ity, did you?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  No. We had the largest farm  in the ar ea.We wer e the larges t land owners  there. But life 
was  good. As  a c hild, life was  pretty good.
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
And when it was  c old, you would all s leep in the kitc hen, I think.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  That's r ight. We had an oven that you were able to stay on top of it s o it was  warm . 

Rom ania is  ver y c old in the winter and ver y hot in the s ummer , s o the two different time per iods.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How big was  the J ewis h c ommunity?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  There wer e approxim ately, I would s ay, maybe 20, 25 J ewis h fam ilies  s c atter ed all 
ar ound Buc ium. Buc ium was  a nic e
-
s ized town. The two brother s
 
--
 
the two unc les, my father 's 
br others , they lived c lose. Eac h one had a hous e and owned a thir d of the farm. So they lived within 
pr oximity but not next to eac h other. So eac h was  in a differ ent hous e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But a sm all c ommunity.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I t hink I mentioned in the beginning that you'll c elebr ate your birthday in Dec ember  of 

this  year, Dec ember
 
36. 
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  26.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  You had thr ee differ ent birth dates .Why was  that?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Well, originally, when I was  born, c oming from a small town, you didn't go to the big c ity 
to regis ter a new
-
bor n c hild. So finally when m y father got the c hanc e to go he regis tered. And 
s om etimes  the
y 
r egis ter  the day he s howed up to the office, s om etimes the
y 
r egister any kind of a 
bir thday. So m ost times, even m y m other  always  knew the different birthdays . So I had Dec em ber
 
28, 
Dec ember
 
26, 1938, 1936. So finally I was  able to s end away a request from  the governm ent of 
Rom ania to s end me m y birth c ertific ate.
 
And the bir th cer tific ate cam e back as  Decem ber
 
26, 1936.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you're c omfortable with that?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Comfortable, yeah.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Although Wor ld War II didn't begin until Ger many and Rus s ia attacked Poland in 1
939, 
it was n't until 1941 that the lives of your  family and other J ews  in your c ommunity near the c ity of Ias i 

c hanged dr amatic ally. Tell us  about that per iod, if you c an, between when war began in Europe in 1939 
and things  began to really go bad for  you in 1941
, t
he events  that led up to you being forc ed to m ove in 
1942 that we'll talk about a little bit later .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Between 1939 and 1941 like you m entioned, nothing r eally c hanged for us.We did hear 

s om etimes , in 1941, J ews being s ent away to camps , people being killed, m urder ed. But that didn't 
r eally affec t us ver y, ver y muc h. Ther e was  anti
-
Semitis m in that town after the war  star ted bec aus e a 
lot of Romanian, es pec ially the Iron Guard r egime, they wer e anti
-
Semitic and wer e pretty m uc h doing
 
a lot of har m,
 
pogr om
s , k illing one c itizen against another. So that happened before. But not really 
m ajor  things  until 1942. One day in Novem ber of 1942
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we turn to that, there was  a
 
pogrom
. Tell us what a
 
pogrom
 
was . And there 
was  
a ter rible one in 1941 in Rom ania.Was n't ther e?
 
> > Nat S haffir:  Right. Espec ially in Ias i. In J uly
 
1941, the Rom anian government, Iron Guar d, one 
par tic ular  inc idenc e, they loaded two trainloads  with individuals , c attle c ars, fr om  Ias i up at the nort
h all 
the way down to Calarasi, a town approximately s ix or  s even hours away, bac k  and forth. And that was  

the m iddle of J uly whic h was  very hot. For  thr ee days  they wer e s ending them back  and for th. And 
when they c ame back  to Ias i, I would say half of the
 
people wer e dead.
 
 
In addition to that, als o in J uly of 1941, 10,000 J ews  wer e killed in Romania bec aus e the 
governm ent did not objec t for other Rom anian c itizens  to kill J ewis h people. So thes e people were 

killed by m ac hetes , by axes , with c lubs , any way
 
they wer e able to.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  10,000?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  10,000.
 

4 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that time, after  the start of the war , during the period you'r e desc r ibing, do you 
think  your  par ents and other J ews  in your  c ommunity wer e aware of what was  happening to J ews  
els ewher e in Eur ope now that the Nazis  were c onquering c ountr y after c ountr y? 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  We heard a little bit. Obviously ther e was  no r adios
,  
no news  that we wer e able to get; 
s o things filter in fr om people who used to go to the market. People c om ing back fr om differ ent c ities , 
hear ing what happened. But we r eally didn't know the extent how far  the Ger m ans had done what they 

had done.
 
We hear d c am ps  wer e s et up, people wer e being m urder ed but it was  not really ver y c lear  at 
that tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And during that tim e, wer e your fam ily able to c ontinue oper ating the dairy and you 
were able to stay in bus ines s  dur ing that time?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yes, we were.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the fall of 1942, you wer e about to tell us  about that,
 
your fam ily and other  J ews  from  
Buc ium , you were abruptly forc ed to pick  up and move. Tell us what that was  about, what happened, 
and how it happened. You have m em ories  of that.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. Going back  a little bit, every time 
--
 
as  I m entioned 
ear lier
,  
the pries t was  one of 
our  neighbor s, us ed to come by onc e a week
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The one asking for donations.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Right. And m y m other  always  told us  to be polite and go out and greet the pr ies t, the 
m an of the c loth, ask  him to his  health, his health of his  fam ily. And one day in November
 
1942, the 
s am e pr ies t s howed up. But this tim e he showed up with a police officer and two Iron Guard armed with 

r ifles  and bayonets . We really c ouldn't under stand what happened at that time. So actually all of us  
c am e out to gr eet him to find out what's  going on. And when we came c los e to the pr iest, the pr iest 
tur ned to the polic e officer, pointing at us, and s aying to the polic e offic er , [Speaking Non
-
E nglis h 
Language], "Thes e ar e Jews ." So the
 
polic e offic ers  told us that we have four hours to vac ate that far m; 
we c an take any belongings that we c an carry and one hors e, wagon, load whatever  we c an. 
  
 
And after four  hour s
 
--
 
s o what happens , m y mother tr ied to reas on with him . My father  tr ied t
o 
r eas on with him. My father  even told him
, 
I have known you s inc e you were a little boy, known your  
family for all of thes e years , c an't you do s omething about forgetting that order to evac uate us ?  He s aid 

the r eas on we'r e giving you the four  hours  is bec aus e you know us  and the fam ily other wis e I wouldn't 
have to give you the four hour s.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So that was  an ac t of grac ious nes s  he was  des cribing it as, by allowing him  the four 

hour s .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Right. So m y mother realized there's  no way
 
s he c an c onvince him other wis e s o s he 
or dered the thr ee of us to go into the hous e and put on as  m any layer s  of c lothing as pos s ible. They 

s
tarted getting s tuff together. The f
ir s t thing I r emem ber, we had a little box. She kept the c as h, m oney, 
jewelry. 
So s he took  that fir st. Then s he took anything of value. She took  blankets , pillows , c ooking 
utensils , anything that s he knew s he would be needing bec aus e we wer e going to be [Inaudible] the 
loc ation.
 
So four hours  wer e over . The polic em en c am e and s aid tim e was  up.We wer e es c or ted to the 
outskirts  of Iasi, whic h was  s et up as  a ghetto a year  ear lier  in 1941.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you des c r ibed it to m e when I first m et you, it was  like a bolt out of the blue. Des pite 

ther e was  har ds hips  and ther e had been
 p
ogr om
s  that you knew about, nonetheles s , you still wer e 
living in your  farm  and then out of the blue
 
--
 
you s aid the fam ily was  c ompletely s tunned by this .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Well, when we ar rived in the ghetto, we received like one room. Com ing from a big 
h
ous e in c ompar ison
 
--
 
it was  a big hous e at that tim e. Com ing fr om  a big hous e and from a norm al 
living s ituation com ing into one room in a ghetto area, that was  ver y, very hard to take.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nat, you mentioned that bes ides  the polic e with the priest ther e was  als o the Ir on 

Guar d.What was  the Iron Guar d? 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Or iginally Romania was  a monarc hy. And the Iron Guar d was  a gener al by
 
--
 
a c oup 
that overtook  the king. They took  c ontr ol. They were fas c is ts. They didn't like J ews  in par tic
ular s o they 
ac tually ruled the c om pany fr om the time the king left.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the Iron Guard was  the fas c is ts  in Romania.
 

5 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  The Germans  never invaded Romania. But the fasc ists  of the Ir on Guar d did pr etty 
m uc h their dir ty work  for  them.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you were s o little but you remember taking that wagon ride from  your farm, don't 

you?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Abs olutely. And then onc e we arrived in that area, as I s aid, we wer e given one room  
for the five of us . Ther e was  a c ompletely c lean room, nothing in the r oom whats oever exc ept two beds
, 
n
o cabinets, no tables no c hairs. That was  pr etty depres s ing as well.
 
 
Onc e we arr ived in the ghetto ar ea, our nam es wer e taken down, gender , and ages . Then we 
were given r ation. And the ration allowed us  a quota of a loaf of br ead every two days  and five liter s  of 
ker os ene onc e a week for c ooking and for heating.
 
There were other things on the ration but we never  
s aw thes e bec aus e these wer e s old on the black  market. They never s aw thes e thing
s  befor e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you des c r ibed the ghetto as  an open ghetto.What did that mean? What was  an 

open ghetto?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  There were two kinds of ghettos . There was  the c los ed ghetto, c los ed m eaning with 
bar be
d wir e. And the open ghetto
 
was  J ews  wer e allowed to go and only s tay within a c er tain amount 
of str eets .
 
And als o, even though we were es tablis hed in that ghetto, we had to wear a y
ellow s tar 
identifying us  as  J ews  with the word "J ew" on it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was  fir s t ghet
to?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. Onc e we ar rived, that's  pr etty m uc h what happened.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was your entire family m oved into that ghetto with you? 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  The ghetto was  es tablis hed
 
--
 
ther
e wer e large hous es . Eac h hous e
 
had appr oximately 
fiv
e or s ix r ooms . Eac h fam ily was  put into one of thes e r ooms. And we r ec eived one of thes e r ooms  at 
that tim e. And to be able to get thes e r ations, we had to go outs ide the ghetto.We c ould not leave the 
ghetto befor e 5:00. Anybody that moved out of the ghetto would be punis hed s everely. Of c ours e, you 
had to wear  the yellow s tar identifying as  J ews . So they knew exac tly who we are and where we are. 
So that was  the open ghetto part bec aus e only could go into c ertain ar ea of the c ity.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you
 
would r emain living in thos e c irc um s tanc es , I think  the Soc ola ghetto
,  
for thr ee 
year s , 1942 until the s pr ing of 1945 when the Russ ians  c am e. Tell us about that period. Rations were 

lim ited
. F
or almos t thr ee year s , how did your  family to s ur vive.?  How di
d y ou 
m anage to m ake ends  
m eet, put food
 
on the table with your r ations ;
 
as  you s aid, a quarter  loaf of br ead and a little bit of 
ker osene?  What was  the c onditions  like for you in ther e?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  One thing important to remem ber, the ghetto had a b
ig blac k  mar ket area. What 

happened, anybody who s till had any m oney left or  brought with them or anything to trade with, they 

would be able to buy c ertain things . I'm not talking about luxur y things but pair  of pants.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Nec es s ities .
 
>> Nat 
Shaffir:  Nec es s ities , food and s o on. It was  pretty tough bec aus e every pers on in that ghetto 
had to go to work. And every pers on had a m anual job. My father , for instanc e, he was  a street c leaner. 
He was  s uppos ed to s weep the s tr eets  in the total c ity of
 
Ias i.
 
 
In addition to that, his  area that he was  c leaning was  also the m arket area. And it was  pr etty 
degr ading for him to do that. So, one day while he was  c leaning that m ark et area, an old farm er that he 

knew, that my father helped a lot, cam e over to him and s aid [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language] to m y 
father, I'm really s orr y to s ee you, the c ondition you ar e in; I k now how wealthy you wer e but here you 

ar e sweeping the streets and s weeping
.  Y
ou're from the m ark et
, h
e s aid, I'm going to tr y to get 
toget
her  with a c ouple of other farm er s and s ee, per haps , we c an help you with s om e additional food.
 
 
The next week m y father c am e back  to s weep that area of the mark et, the old farmer cam e 
bac k  to him and he s aid s ome of our farmer s  agreed to help you and here
's  how we'r e going to do that. 
He s aid all the farm ers  get together on Wednes day night and dr ive into the Soc ola, to the Ias i market 

for Thur s day morning market. We pass  on the outskirts  of the ghetto between 2:00
 
and 3:00
 
in the 
m or ning. So we dec ided that between 2:00
 
in the mor ning, why don't you wait for  us in a c ertain 
loc ation, and they told him wher e, and watc h out for the las t thr ee wagons bec aus e what's going to 

happen, we going to try to thr ow s om ething at you. 
 

6 
 
 
So my father actually ris ked his  life to go out there. Bec aus e anybody c aught between 
2:00
 
and 3:00
 
in the m orning only m eant one thing, you wer e tr ying to es cape. So that would be 
punis hable by pr is on or pr obably wor s e than that s om etim es.
 
But my father dec ided it's wor th the 
gam ble to go
 
out per haps  for extr a food for his  fam ily. 
 
 
So the next Wednes day night, Thur s day m or ning, he went out ther e. He saw the c ar avan of 
thes e farm ers  c oming in towar ds  Ias i. He hid behind a wall. And then he saw the las t three wagons. 
They faked a br eakdown.
 
And three farmers, the las t three wagons , got off their wagons  and tr ied to 
help out one of the farm er s . And when they s aw they didn't s ee polic e or anybody els e, they thr ew a 

s ack or  a bag of stuff c los e to wher e my father was  hiding. After they left my father looked around to 
m ake s ur e nobody s aw that and then he saw everything was  c lear, he was  able to take that s ack . And 
in that s ack som etim es  you'll find potato, s ometimes  fruit, s om e c hees es , som e eggs, things , additional 

food.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Did th
at happen m or e than onc e?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. It happened for quite a while, ac tually. Als o s om etim es  we find c ured meat. One 
tim e around Chr is tmas  tim e, the next year, we found a c ur ed ham.We kept kos her  s o we c ouldn't eat 
that s o m y father tr aded 
that with other  people for other things . But als o, to be c aught tr ading on the 
blac k  market was  in a s ens e. So if a c hild
 
--
 
what happened, my father us ed to let me c arr y that, what 
they c alled contr aband. He us ed to walk about 30
 
feet ahead of me and I would walk behind him with 
that. So if a child would get c aught with c ontr aband, he would probably be s lapped ar ound a c ouple of 

tim es. But if a gr own
-
up get c aught with that he would be put in pr is on.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Or wor se
, 
as you s aid.
 
>> Nat Shaffir: 
 
Right. So m any year s  later  m y father  always  told people that he always  took me along 
for his  pr otection.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Nat Shaffir:  So that was  ac tually
 
--
 
this went on for about 18 m onths. Thes e far mer s helped us 
m any, m any tim es. By getting all of thes e extra things  from thes e farm er s, number one, the mother  was  

always  tr ying to give s om e
 
--
 
ther e was  an old teacher, a r abbi, that taught us Bible and his  wife taught 
us  s ec ular s tudies. So my mother always  thought to give s om ething back  to s omebody b
ec aus e they 
c ontr ibuted tim e to us . Although all we had was  tim e. So s he always  did that.
 
And then by tr ading 
c er tain things  for things we did not have
, so
m etim es  flour, som etimes  oil. So that's  what you were 
tr ading. Us ually my father never  traded for  
m oney but only for things  he wanted.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At some point, do 
I 
r em em ber  c orr ectly that your  father was  able to actually get s om e 
c attle and m aintain s om e cattle?
 

> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah, on the outskir ts he was  not r eally allowed to do that but s om ehow he did that. So 
ther e was  a certain per iod of tim e he did that but after  that he pr etty m uc h gave that up bec aus e he was  
too afraid.
 
 
I r em ember one time the far mer  c ame over  to him after s o m any months and he s aid that 
ther e wer e s ome people ac tually telling the authorities  that s om e of the farmers from that area ar e 

helping J ewis h people in the ghetto and it's  getting to be ver y danger ous for  us and our  families  to 
c ontinue to help you. Obvious ly m y father under stood that he s houldn't tak e any gambl
es  like that. And 
that's  stopped for a while.
 
 
Als o, when we were getting the r ations , we had to leave the ghetto to get the br ead and the 
ker osene. My s is ter  was  two years  older than m e but my father us ed to s end me out bec aus e ther e 

were a lot of hooligans  pic king on gir ls. So he was  always  afraid for my s is ter  s o he s ent m e out. Many 
tim es I c om e back  with a bloody nos e. That didn't hurt as  m uch as  when my br ead was  taken away 

fr om  m e from thes e hooligans bec aus e it m eant for two days  we had nothing to e
at.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that per iod that you wer e in the ghetto
 
were you able to get any s c hooling?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  First of all, J ews  were no longer allowed to go to s c hool s o the only s c hooling we got 

was  s tric tly from that elderly teac her that was  teac hing us .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that was  s ort of 
bart
er, too. Wasn't it? 
 

7 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. Actually, later , after the war , when we went bac k  to s c hool, we were the oldes t in 
eac h c las s
. A
ll the c hildren thought thes e J ews  are pretty dum b kids bec aus e we wer e the oldes t, 
m aybe two, thr ee years older  than anybody els e in the s ame grade s o obvious ly we m us t have done 

s om ething wr ong or there m ust have been s om ething we couldn't do. But eventually we c aught up.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In other  words , you had mis s ed thr ee full years  of educ ation.
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  Yes.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  And during that tim e, did the Ir on Guar d enter the ghetto?  Did they c om e in to haras s  
you or s how their  pres enc e?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  The Iron Guard didn't c ome but the polic e, whic h
 
was  part of the Ir on Guar d but
 
--
 
the 
Ir on Guar d was  str ic tly Arm y. The polic e was  par t of the units. Yes, they wer e in the ghettos  walking 

ar ound. I rem em ber when they us ed to go to tr ade 
--
 
when I used to go to trade with my father, our 
s ignal was  if he
 
m oved to the right, a polic eman was c om ing for ward and I s hould be moving to the left. 
So that's how we c oor dinated things s o polic e wouldn't c atc h me. But the polic e wer e pretty active in 

ther e to try to find things .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Looking for people bartering or doing black  m arket or  things like that.
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had a fairly large extended family. Wer e mem bers of your  extended family in the 
ghetto with you? 
 

> > Nat Shaffir:  No. What happened is  s inc e my fam ily c omes  fr om  Hungar y, the easter n part of 
Hungar y, the r est of the family remained in Hungar y. And then later we found out after the war  what 
happened to them .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And I'm going to ask  you about that pr obably a little later.
 
You did have s ome unc les  
th
at were in s epar ate s ec tions  of the ghetto.
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  Yes. That
 
--
 
the two unc les , my father's  two br others , and two s is ter s  that he had. So 
they wer e in a differ ent par t of the ghetto. We s aw them onc e in a while. But they were in c om pletely 

differ
ent ar eas . Mos t of them  s urvived. One of them  did not. One of them  was  part of the tr ain that went 
fr om  Ias i to Calar as i but did not c ome back . And ther e wer e c ous ins.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  You were a kid and with your  s is ter s  and other  kids.What does  a kid
 
--
 
as a kid, what 
did you do to entertain your s elves ?  As  you s aid, you had nothing but time.Wer e you able to have fun 
as  a kid during that tim e at all or any r ecr eation?  That was thr ee year s of your  life there.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  First of all, num ber  one, t hey for c ed us  to som etim es to do s om e manual work in 
c leaning stables.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You inc luding the kids ?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. And the only fun we had, s ome m other took  s om e rags and m ade a ball out of 

that, sewed together, and that was  pr etty m uc h
 
like a kick  ball.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Made of r ags.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you als o s har ed with me that you would play a game of m ar bles us ing walnuts .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Corr ec t. Obvious ly we did not have elec tric ity. So the way people went to s leep very 
ear ly but after dinner, I remem ber my father us ed to get a s ack full of walnuts  and we would c r ac k  nuts , 
talk  a little bit. Bec aus e there was  no plac e to go
. 
So anytim e m y father c ame back  with s om e news , 
telling to m y m other, we 
all knew what went on. But then the kids would have this  little hole and then 
you flip thes e nuts. And whoever  c am e c los er  would gain the r est of them. That was  part of our 
entertainm ent, our play.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You mentioned, of c ours e, your  educ ation was  very informal with the one former 
teac her.Wer e you able to pr actic e, religious pr actic es  while you wer e there?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  All the religion was  not allowed but we did practic e religion, kind of underground. 
Otherwis e it was  not allowed to pr actice religion.
 
Many of the ghetto res idents  were r eligious  and some 
were s ec ular .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were des cr ibing how to protec t your  s is ter you would have to go out for rations  

and sometim es get into sc uffles. That m akes m e want to ask  you about this  fe
llow, Gr igory.
 

8 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  What happened was  to get m y r ations  for  the keros ene, we had to leave the ghetto. 
After 5:00
 
we line up next to the keros ene s tation. There was  a booth that the attendant would s tay 
ther e. In front of the booth about s ix fee
t away, ther e was  a white line. We lined up behind that line. So, 

again, we s tarted around 5:00, a lilt bit after  5:00. The attendant would s how up ar ound 7:00, 7:30.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you had been ther e s ince 5:00.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  In the c old, rain. Didn't have any rainc oats  in par tic ular. So it was  pretty tough tim e. 

When he s howed up, he finally would c ome out and would m otion to five people to c om e for war d. He 
would then take the ration c ar d and take out the coupons  of that partic ular week. And then
 
he will pump 
the keros ene. 
 

 
And the way ker os ene was  pum ped in thos e days
 
--
 
not like today, you dr ive up to a pump. 
There was  a r egular pump. In fr ont of that pum p was  a big cylinder. In front of the c ylinder  was  a handle 
and when you m oved the handle b
ack  and forth, that would br ing up keros ene from the tank from  the 
ground
 a
nd filled up the c ylinder . Onc e the cylinder was  full,
 
that would be five 
liter s . And then they put 
the hos e into the c an or  whatever  you brought for the keros ene and you c om e back  
next tim e.
 
 
So one day I dec ided to appr oac h this  individual. His  name was Grigor y. I took a c hanc e to 
appr oac h him  becaus e Jews  did not do what I planned to do. So I c am e over to him and I s aid to 

him
 
--
 
I called him  [Speaking Non
-
E nglis h Language]. It's 
s om ebody with author ity, s omebody very 
educ ated, s om ebody with high influenc e. He, by the way, was  an uneduc ated per son, lazy, and a 
dr unk. So that was  the eas ies t way to des c ribe
 
him . So I s aid, 
 
[Speaking Non
-
E nglis h 
Language]
 
Gr igor y, I'd lik e to help you. And he's look ing at me. He s aid to me,
 
ﬁY
ou little [Speaking 
Non
-
Englis h Language]
ﬂ 
--
 
by the way, a very derogator y word for  a J ew. 
ﬁ
You little [Speaking 
Non
-
Englis h Language], you going to help m e?
ﬂ
  
I s aid, 
ﬁY
es .
ﬂ  
He s aid, 
ﬁH
ow ar e going to do that?
ﬂ
  
I 
s aid, 
ﬁY
ou look s ick
ﬂ--
 
probably had a hangover . 
ﬁ
You look  s ick
. W
hy don't I do your job and if it 
pleas es  you, m aybe you c an give m e a little extra ker os ene bec aus e I have a s ister at home, it's c old in 
the r oom and she's s ick and that would help us
 
a lot.
ﬂ 
 
So he didn't s ay anything. The next week I lined up, m us t have been 30th in line. He c omes 
over . He's looking for me. He s aid, 
ﬁL
ittle [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language], c ome over  her e.
ﬂ  
He says , 
ﬁL
et me s ee what you c an do, what you told m e las t week  you c an do.
ﬂ 
So I did. I told five people to 
c om e for ward in the line, pum p the keros ene, do all the things. So for  a while
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e 8, 9 year s  old?
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  10.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Almos t 10.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  So he let m e do that about thr ee weeks . But he never
 
gave m e anything. And then I 
s aid to mys elf
, 
what a dum my I am. Her e I am doing extra work for s omebody and I don't s ee anything. 
But finally the fourth week  he s aid to m e, 
ﬁL
ittle [Speaking Non
-
Englis h Language], bring an
 
extra can 
next tim e with you.
ﬂ  So 
from  
that 
point on I was  always  getting another liter, another liter and a half of 
ker osene, whic h helped us  a lot, number one, to keep the hous e warm
 a
nd als o give m e an additional 
s om ething to trade with som ebody. So that was  a good time to do.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At one point you gave him s om e brandy, if I r em em ber .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. What happened
 
--
 
that was  after they took  m y father away.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  My father  was  taken away in 1942. In J un
e 
1944, he was  taken away to s lave labor  
c am p in the east. Ever y per s on that wor ked in the ghetto would leave in the mor ning and c om e bac k  

late in the after noon, in the evening. But this  time ther e was  a notic e plac ed in the ghetto that every 
m an between the ages of 18 and 50 m us t 
as s emble 
within three days  and they will not be c oming 
hom e. So obvious ly the rum or s s pr eading around what's  going to happen, s o thes e people would be 
s hipped out. 
 
 
I r em ember the day he left to as s em ble.We all cried. My m other 
c r ied, and us . We didn't know 
if we wer e ever going to s ee m y father  again. We knew if we were going to s ee him  it would be m any, 
m any months  later .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you know wher e he was  going to go?
 

9 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  No, only that he was  s hipped east to lay railr oad tracks becaus e that was  the r umor.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And east was  wher e the front was .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Corr ec t. So the fir st thing that the author ities did, number one, they revoked our 
five
-
per s on r ation c ard to a four ration c ard. Now you
 
only r ec eived one loaf of bread rather  than a loaf 
and a quarter . So when my father  left, the last day I r em ember that I ask ed if 
c
an 
I 
ac c om pany him to 
the area. He s aid yes . And we wer e walking on the s tr eet of the ghetto to wher e they wer e as s em bled. 

H
e put his hand ar ound my s houlder and he s aid, "Nat, tak e c are of the girls ." That's the las t thing he 
s aid to me.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your s ister s and your mom.
 
>> Nat Shaffir
:  Yeah. A 9
-
year
-
old kid. C
an you 
imagine the am ount of pres s ure that puts  on a c h
ild, to 
take c are of a mother  and two s is ters?  It was  enor mous.
 
Anyway, I did that.
 
 
So one day I tried to get a s hir t.Wher e we kept our c lothing was  under neath the bed bec aus e 
we had no c los ets. So I was  looking for  a s hir t. I als o found a bottle of plum brandy. I wrap it in a shirt 

and I dec ided to take it to this  Gr igor y. I didn't tell my mother  what I was  planning to do bec aus e 
pr obably s hould would not have let me do that.
 
 
So I c am e
 
--
 
the next day I c am e over to the attendant and I s aid to him, 
ﬁ
Gr igor y, I have a 
pr es ent for you.
ﬂ 
So I gr abbed that s hirt and s howed him  the bottle of brandy. His  eyes  lit up. So he 
s aid to me, "I pr es um e you want s om e extra keros ene for that." I s aid, "Actually no
. What I would like to 

have is  another r ation c ar d fo
r a fam ily of four." 
 
 
Now, I was  
thinking what els e c an I get to s upport my fam ily to keep them alive in a way. So 
this  was  one way to do it. I c ould have been punished drastic ally for  bribing him in a way but everything 

worked out. A few weeks  later he showed up with a ration c ar d for  four whic h in a way, gave us another 
loaf of br ead every two days , another five liter s of keros ene once a week. So we were able to trade
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To allow you 
to 
m anage to c ontinue with your father  gone.
 
>> Nat Sh
affir:  Corr ec t. And als o I made s ure also that every month, at leas t, I was  able to buy on the 
blac k  market a bottle of brandy to br ing to him s o I c ould keep m y job in a way. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right. I think we'r e seeing a glimps e of why you bec am e a ver
y successful 
entr epreneur.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Bill Bens on:  So thr ee year s  and then finally you're liber ated when the Rus s ians  take Ias i in the 
s pr ing of 1945. Tell us about that tim e, about the Rus s ian attack on Ias i and then what it meant for you 
and your
 
family dur ing their attack  but als o in the time after that.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  The tim e that we wer e ther e, fr om tim e to tim e ther e was  bom bardm ent on the c ity of 
Ias i. Some heavy, s ome not s o heavy. One night
 
--
 
the authorities always  told us  at night to c
over  the 
windows  bec aus e we had ker os ene lam ps, s o the enemy would not s ee the lights  s o blackout.
 
Onc e 
we wer e in that ghetto
 
--
 
s o when the bom bs s tarted to fall, we would r un out to outs ide to fields. Ther e 
were trenc hes dug up
 a
nd branc hes put up on top of that. That would be our  bom b s helter.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Branc hes?
 

> > Nat Shaffir:  Br anches .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In
 
a hole in the gr ound.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Exac tly, yeah. So one night they s tarted bom bardm ent. We all
 
r an out to thes e 
tr enc hes. B
ut this tim
e it las ted thr ee days . It didn't stop. It was  ver y heavy bombar dment. And then one 
day ther e was  quiet.We didn't know what happened. So one individual from  that hole, from the tr enc h, 
looked out, picked up s ome of the branches and looked out, and he s aid
, ﬁW
e are liberated. The 
Rus s ians  are here.
ﬂ  
 
So we c ouldn't under s tand what he m eant by that. So we looked out, and we s aw thes e 
individuals  dr es s ed in long br own c oats, gray c oats , rather, with a gr ay hat, fur  hat with the r ed star  on 
their for ehead. And
 
the guy s aid, "Thes e ar e Rus sians ." And that's  exac tly what happened.We wer e 
liberated by the Rus s ians  in the s pring of 1945.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During the bom bar dm ents, you m entioned the blackouts. You c ould be heavily 

penalized or  punis hed, punis hed, if you didn't blac kout your hous e. Right?
 

10
 
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And if I remember r ight, you c ould be ac c used of being a s py for the Rus s ians .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Exac tly. The J ews , m os t of them , in many c ountries, wer e ac c us ed of being s pies  fo
r 

the enemies . That's  probably what happened. So obvious ly everybody did what we wer e as ked at that 
tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right. And dur ing that tim e your father is  still gone. Right?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Father is  s till gone. We didn't hear from  him for alm o
st a year until after  the war .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Until after  the war .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  We didn't know if he was  alive, dead.We didn't hear  fr om him.We didn't hear fr om 

anybody, from all the men who wer e taken away at that time, we didn't hear from  them.
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  So onc e the Rus s ians  were ther e, your father and m any other men are gone. You 
r ealize you're liberated
. W
hat did that ac tually mean then other  than the Romanian and the Nazis  are 
gone? What did that m ean to you?
 

>> Nat Shaffir:  It didn't 
m ean anything other than we wer e able to r ec eiv e more food, bec aus e food 
was  available, now, m ore at this  point. We would get a c er tain s c ript for money. We wer e able to buy in 

the stores. Befor e that we c ouldn't buy anything in the s tore. Even though we had money, we c ouldn't 
buy. J ews  c ould not buy in an open stor e. So we wer e able to do that. We wer e able to go back  to 
s c hool. 
 
 
And little by little people started to c ome back . Men s tar ted to c ome back  to the ghettos. And 
ever y tim e we s aw s om ebody, we always  as ked did you s ee s uc h and s uch. Did you s ee m y father?  

People we knew fr om  the ghetto
 
--
 
one partic ular one told us one tim e when he c ame back, he said, 
Yes , I've s een your father about a m onth beforehand; he was  tr ansferr ed further east
 
but he was
 
in 
good c ondition. So we hope that sinc e he only s aw him  a m onth ago, perhaps  m aybe he s till s urviv ed.
 
 
There was  no public  tr ans por tation to c ome anywher e. So finally one day m y father s howed 
up. He walked a lot. He hitc hhiked on wagons, Rus s ian c onvoys ,
 
and finally m ade it back  to the ghetto. 
And onc e we wer e ther e, he tr ied to maneuver  c ertain things. He tried to find us  a plac e to move out. 
We moved out. That old farmer did help us again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The one who helped you befor e?
 
>> Nat Shaffir: 
 
Yeah. And first thing we did
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Let me as k  you.What do you know about that time your dad was  gone? What was  it 
like for him ?  What wer e c onditions  like?  Did he shar e muc h with you about what he went through?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. They
 
were wor king. They ac tually laid r ailr oad tr acks . They were wor king 14 and 
16
-
hour days , ver y little food. Mos t of the people los t most of their  weight bec aus e there was  not 
enough nour is hm ent. So things  were tough.
 
 
My father was  a ver y strong m an both phys ic ally and m entally. So that pr obably helped him 
s ur vive. Many of thes e people were taken from the ghetto to the s lave labor  c amp and did not s urvive.  
 

> > Bill Bens on:  How did the Rus s ians  treat you?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  For a while it was  ok. But then we
 
als o found out that they wer e anti
-
S em itism  as well. 
Although we wer e able to go back  to s c hool but Jewis h c hildr en were not allowed to join c omm unis ts  
groups , young s tudent groups . Thes e were establis hed for ver y good students .
 
My younger s is ter, Lily,

as  the top of her c las s , I was  the s ec ond in m y clas s , but we were not allowed to join thes e 
Com munis t, youth pr ogram s .

ec ame 
c om m unists .

> > Nat Shaffir:  So the sam e people r uled the s am e thing. Nothing c hanged. The leopar d s till had the 

s am e s pots.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So tell us  about how your  father and m other m anaged to sor t of begin to at least piec e 

together a life again s o they c ould feed their family. What did they do?
 

11
 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  We went back. Onc e m y father c am e back , he and I went bac k  to the farm . And the fir st 
thing we m ade, we m ade a stop to the old farm er to thank  him for  all the months  that he s lid us  with 
additional food, whic h c hanc es  ar e probably s aved our lives . 
 
 
I r em ember he invited us 
to 
have dinner with him . And then he asked us wher e we'r e going 
fr om  her e. My father s aid he's going back  to the far
m. He s aid
, ﬁ
I would not r ec ommend for you to go 
bac k  bec aus e your life is in danger.
ﬂ 
So m y father s aid, 
ﬁW
hat do you m ean?
ﬂ
  
He s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, the far m 
is  no longer your far m.
ﬂ 
He s aid that farm was  divided into three different s ec tions . One s ection 
r ec eiv
ed the pries t and his  fam ily
; th
e polic eman and his  family.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The s am e pr ies t?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  The s ame pr ies t and the mayor of the town or the pers on in c harge of the Ir on Guar d 

r ec eived the thir d. So our  farm  was  divided into three s ections  that was  given out.
 
 
We always  wonder ed what m ade thes e people do what they did.We ask the ques tions. Like 
old farm er would ris k  his  life and his  family and help us
 w
her e the priest, who was  a m an of the c loth, 
didn't. He turned us  into the 
authorities . So that's  a ques tion we tr ied to find an ans wer for.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know whatever  happened to him?
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  After that, no.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know when you really began to under stand the enor mity of the Holoc aus t and 

to 
know what happened to your  larger, extended fam ily?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  A few months  pass ed after we were liber ated. Things started to tr ickle in, infor mation 
about the J ews  of Hungar y. We found out that the Nazis  invaded Hungary in Marc h of 1944. And 
between
 
A pr il
 
15 of 1944 and J uly
 
9 of 1944, 440,000 J ews  were depor ted to Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In s ix weeks, right?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. Am ong thes e 440,000, 33 were member s  of m y fam ily. There was  m y 

grandpar ents , uncles , aunts , c ous ins .
 
Onc e 
they wer e depor ted, the young ones  and old ones wer e 
imm ediately put to death in the gas c ham ber s. Those who were able to work were s ent to differ ent 

c am ps. Som e of them died.We don't know when, where, or how. 
 
 
The las t thr ee of them we knew for a fac t w
hat happened to them . Ther e was  one of my 
grandfather
s 
and two of his  s ons , two of my unc les . They wer e the las t time in Auschwitz
-
Bir kenau. My 
grandfather died of star vation a m onth befor e he was  liberated. My two unc les  s ur vived the liber ation. 
One was  21 years old and one was  22 years old. They eac h weighed 65
 
pounds . So you c an im agine 
what they looked like.When you hear  skin and bones  or walking skeletons , that's what they wer e.
 
 
When the Red Cr os s c ame into the c amp and s aw thes e people, the c ondition of what thes e 
people looked like, they put them on s hips  and sent them to Sweden to Sanator iums  to rec uperate. 
Unfortunately one of the two br others , two unc les , died on the way to Sweden. He was  buried at s ea. 
The other one s urvived. 
 
 
I rec ently found 
a picture
 
--
 
I mentioned that earlier to you
 
--
f
r om  1949, yeah, about four year s  
after  he was  liberated he finally was able to c ontac t my mother and s end a pic ture, you know fr om 

Sweden. It took  him about four year s  to rec uper ate, to c ome back  to his  nor mal life. Eventually that 

individual did make it to the United States. So fr om  33 c los e, imm ediate family members  only one 
s ur vived. The r est were m urdered.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nat, would
 
--
 
ther e you wer e in Rom ania under the Rus sians  and the c omm unis ts and 
w
ould r em ain living ther e for the next five year s  after the war , I think , 
`
45 to 
`
50. Tell us what life was  
like for you. You began to tell us that you weren't allowed to be a pioneer as  the Communis t youth 

c ould be bec aus e you were J ewis h. What was  life like under the c omm unis ts  thos e five years for  you 
and your fam ily and how wer e you able to imm igrate to Is r ael?  How were you able to do that?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  About two year s  after the war  ended, 1947, m y father realized ther e's no m ore future 
for us  in Rom ania. So he s ubm itted doc uments and requests , forms , to be able to emigrate to leave 
Rom ania. Every tim e he filled out a form to rec eiv e a perm it, a permis s ion to leave, everything c ame 
bac k  denied, denied, denied.
 
 
So finally ar ound 1949 my father was  able to br ibe a high, local author ity, indiv idual. I 
r em em ber they took all m y m other's  jewelry, whatever c as h we had and pretty muc h put it on the line in 

12
 
 
that's  all I have, this  is my las t c hanc e. The las t thing I c an do is  give us  the perm it to leave. And
 
that 
individual did eventually give us  the per mit.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But the br ibe took  everything you had to do that.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. And fr om there we left and we ar rived in Is rael in April
 
1950.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you rem em ber  taking the tr ip to
 
Isr ael?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. We wer e in a big c argo boat. Two big holds. The men wer e in one hold. The 
women in another. At night they all com e up to the deck and kind of c ommunic ate a little bit. It took  a 
long tim e to get by c argo boat to Isr ael.
 
>> B
ill Bens on:  
I t
hink you told m e you had to c ome up with s om e additional bribes  to even get out of 
Europe on the s hip at s om e point.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Well, the s top in Cons tanta, the port c ity in the black s ea. Whatever value, s he was  able 
to give them  to 
leave.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did any fam ily m em ber s rem ain in Romania?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Finally the las t one, one of the br other s
 
--
 
m ost of the people from my father 's part did 
c om e out. The rest did not. One br other remained bec aus e he had c hildren. They did 
not want to leave 

or  they c ouldn't leave s o the par ents did not want to leave the c hildr en behind. So that brother  
eventually
 
--
 
he was  the oldes t of m y father's  s iblings. He ac tually died in Rom ania. Som e of his 
c hildren did emigr ate to Is r ael
 a
nd s ome di
d not.
 
 
I r ec ently found out, not long ago, there was  one c ous in that is  s till alive, pr obably m y age. But 
we tried to m ake c ontac t and it's ver y har d to find s om ething. I hope maybe one of thes e days  my 
oldes t s on, J eff, is trying to get me to go vis it Romania for him to s ee where I was  born and the ar ea.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You've never  been back?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  No. I did not go back . The m emories  were not s o gr eat to go back.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you think you m ight s till?
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  I think so. At t
his  point he is  in Europe a lot. He's  involved with NATO. So next tim e 
per haps  m aybe. Maybe we will.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So what was  it like to arrive in Is rael for you? 
 

> > Nat Shaffir:  First of all, it was  a fr ee c ountry, obvious ly, number one.
 
> > Bill B en
s on:  Very different than what you had jus t been thr ough.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  And ac tually, the first time, I was  about 14 at that point, firs t time I s aw an orange. 

There was  
--
 
c itr us  didn't gr ow in Eur ope at this  point. So for  the first time, I was  14, I firs t s aw an 
or ange. It was gr eat. 
 
 
So when we c ame, we cam e to abs or ption c enter for a c ouple weeks.

>> Nat Shaffir:  
I
nto the cu
ltur e. We were given docum ents . After two weeks  we were s ent to a r efugee 
ar ea. That was  towards the middle of the c ountry. Then we were plac ed in a tent c ity. We were there for 

a while.
 
 
What my father did, he went into a c ertain c ity, I don't know how m any, 45, 50
 
kilom eter s 
away. He was  able to rent a r oom  in a hous e and was  able to get a job at a dis tributor and finally he 
bought a m ill dis tr ibution. And then later , a couple of year s  later, he brought the fam ily into that c ity. The 
gover nm ent gave us c e
r tain
 
--
 
they c alled [Speaking Non

Englis h Language], c ertain pr efabric ated 
hom es  given for  a very reas onable pr ic e. You wer e able to buy actually not one but two. So we were 

able to bring two. And we went back to s c hool obvious ly at that point.
 

> > Bill B e

you and at leas t one of your s is ters , s oon after you got there
, 
to find 
other r elatives?

13
 
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Right. So her e I am in this  c ountr y, don't s peak a word of the language. My parents , 
why they would s end me?  I wouldn't s end my grandc hildr en today.Well, suc h and s uc h c ity. The nam e 
is  Cohen and they live in a c ertain ar ea. So he s ent me with my two s is ters  to find them .
 
> > Bill B ens o
n:  In "a 
c ertain area."
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  And their name is  Cohen. And Cohen is  like the nam e Sm ith. A lot of people nam ed 
Cohen. But with m y J ewis hness , s peaking Yiddis h and s peaking a little bit of Ger man, finally I was  able 

to find my way. And we finall
y arr ived. We found them.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You found them .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah. I don't know today if I would be willing to do that m ys elf.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1955, when you were I think 19, you joined the Isr aeli Ar my and s aw a lot of c ombat. 

Tell us 
about that.
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  After
 
--
 
going back  to s chool, obvious ly. Then ever y individual, ever y m ale, even fem ale 
for that m atter, have to join the Is r aeli Ar my. I joined the Israeli Army. I s erved in a top unit.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  You were a par atrooper
. Right?
 
>> Nat Shaffir:  P
ar atrooper. Combat in the Suez Canal in 1956. I was wounded at that time. My mother 
s er ved as  a nurs e. So from the field I was  taken to a hos pital that s he happened to be ther e. And the 
fir s t thing s he s aw that they ar e bringing in her s on as  a wounded s on.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had no idea s he was  ther e.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  I did not know, s he did not know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And here c omes  her  s on who is  wounded.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Right. So that was  a ver y tragic  get
-
together .
 
> > B ill 
Bens on:  Ver y dr amatic. Right. And you r ec overed fr om your wounds .
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Yeah, r ecovered fr om my wounds . Everything was  fine. I got a bullet in m y knee. I s till 
r un a lot or did r un until I had m y knee replac ed. I did r un m ar athons. Still do exe
r c is e as  m uc h as  I c an.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You would s tay in Isr ael for I think  11 years. And in 1961, I think  at age 25, you m ade a 

big dec is ion to c ome to the United States. Tell us about that.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  In J uly of 1960, that unc le who s ur vived c ame
 
to vis it m y mother . He c am e from the 
United States . I was  c ons tantly talking to him. Told m e all of thes e stories  about Americ a, all of the 
great s tor ies . I asked him  if he would let m e c ome for  a vis it. So he s ponsor ed m e. I c ame to vis it him.
 
> > Bill B e
ns on:  As a vis itor.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  As a vis itor. I fell in love with this  countr y but I c ouldn't stay bec aus e I c ame in on a 
vis itor vis a. So I had to leave the c ountr y and c ome back a couple of week s  later, whic h I did. Then I 
c am e back as a
 
--
 
on a re
gular visa and s tayed in this  c ountr y s inc e. So he ac tually s pons or ed m e to 
c om e to the United States. And that was  a problem  bec aus e I applied for a gr een c ar d. And to be able 
to apply for a gr een c ard, I had to have a job s omewhere. Other wis e they figured I would be tapping 
into the gover nm ent s oc ial s ituation. 
 
 
So s inc e m y mother  wanted m e to be a dentis t, in the fir st years of dentistry we teac h us lab 
work. So I told people that I'm a dental tec hnic ian. So I found a laboratory in New York and I explai
ned 
to them I would like a job and what I would need is  letter s, c onstant letter s that the immigration 
department would r equire. He s aid, fine, we'll do that. The regular pay us ually for a dental tec hnic ian at 
that tim e was  about
 
$125 a week . But thes e people s aid they c ould 
only pay
 
$45 a week. So I s aid 
I'll 
take it. So I took  the job. Obvious ly after  two year s  I didn't stay there. There was n't enough r eally to 

s ur vive on that bec aus e I did r ent a little apar tm ent, an attic of s omebody's  hous e a little ap
artment. So 
I r ented that. So between that and food and a c ouple of s hoes , pair of s hoes , nothing was  left. So I 
s ubs idized that with s ometim es being a Cas hier in a s uperm arket, was hing windows , doing any kind of 

work jus t to get additional m oney.
 
> > Bill 
Bens on: What about your  s isters and your par ents ?  Did they c om e?  Did they s tay in Is rael?
 

> > Nat Shaffir:  They s tayed in Is rael. My younger  s is ter got mar ried to a sur vivor fr om Poland. And 
they ac tually m oved to Ger many and lived in Germ any for a while. All these people, thes e s urvivor s  in 
Europe, Ger many was  a big countr y at that tim e and was  developing and there was  a lot of money to 

14
 
 
be m ade and to be able to m ake it eas ier. Als o, it was  against the law at that tim e to openly declare 
anti
-
S em itism .
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  In Ger many.
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  In Germany. So they felt very safe the this point after  the war , whic h they did not feel 
before.
 
 
My older s is ter s till lives  in Isr ael. And now my younger  s ister lives  in Is r ael as  well, bac k  and 
forth.

Bens on: We have s om e tim e for questions  fr om our audienc e. Should we turn to our audienc e?
 
 
We're going to clos e the progr am in a few m inutes . It's  our tradition at
 
First Person
 
that our 
Firs t Pers on has  the last word. So I'm going to turn back to Nat to

I'm going to ask you, if you wouldn't m ind, staying with us  thr ough the ques tion and ans wer

If you

has  one on the left. If you have a question, tr y to m ake it as brief as you can.We'll get to as m any 
questions  as you have and we have tim e.
 
 
I'm als o going to let you know that after  we finis h the p

c an you stay for a few

Do we have any brave s ouls  who would like to ask  Nat a question?  We'll look  over for  that

Her e we go. Let us  get a m ic  to you. Sonya will pas s  you the m ic. I'm  going to r epeat the

that's  a very, ver y impor tant thing for people to s peak  out. Bec aus e a lot of things  ar e happening and 
people don't s ay anything. That's very, very bad for that. So we hope that more people will s peak out

Any other questions ? 
 
 
Well, with no fur ther  ques tions , I might tur n over to Nat for his  c lo

Nat?
 
> > Nat Shaffir:  Speec h is a very power ful tool. Many individuals , m any people, m any nations  kept 
quiet, didn't s peak out agains t the atr oc ities and the Holoc aus t, what happened the Holoc aus t year s , 

dur ing the Holocaus t years. All of thos e people who kept s ilent r ealize now what happened. 
It's ver y 
impor tant that they don't keep quiet. As I mentioned ear lier , very important to s peak  out. It's  our  duty 

and our r es pons ibility to hum anity to make s ur e things  like this  does n't happen again. So if you s ee 
s om ething is  wr ong, anywhere, s peak out bec ause s peak is r eally powerful.
 
 
Thank  you for lis tening.
