Interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer 
March 29, 1992 
Re: Parents - Dr. Gerson Reif and Klara Reif 
 
Q: The date is Sunday, March 29, 1992.  We
™re speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer 
about her father, Dr. Gerson Reif.  What 
can you tell us about your father?  What 
do you know?   Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?  
 
A: I don™t really know anythi
ng about his family.  The only things I can say about 
my father is that -- first of all, appare
ntly he was a pretty good daddy.  Apparently 
he really wanted very much to have a 
daughter and so he was apparently very 
happy when I was born, as a girl.  I think 
he was probably a fa irly serious person 
but I think he was probably less way out than
 either of his children -- in the sense 
that I think he was serious 
about his professional pursuit
s but he also apparently 
enjoyed going to the opera and so on.  
I guess he and my mother bought sort of 
popular music records of the day and so I 
don™t think -- I have 
a feeling that he 
was not like an ultra intellectual type
 but very serious about his work.  
 

Q: Do you know where he went to school
 or anything about his education? 
 

A: He went to school in Vienna, that™s all 
I really know.  Then 
he actually wa s in the 
war during World Wa r I and he was wounded. 
 He was in the Austrian army and 
he was wounded at the Russian front.  Ac
tually I™ll take you on a three -minute 

tour to show you a certificate that he got for that.  That happened during his 

me dical training apparently and 
then he went back and --. 
 
Q: Had his parents -- you said
 he was born in Poland? 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Grew up in Poland basically 

 

A: Yes and apparently he wa s the only one of the children who did anything 
professional. 
 

Q: Do you know anything about any of the other children? 

 

A: Well,  I know about the two who are in 
New York and my Aunt Lena came  here I 
think in the 1920™s; got ma rried and she a
nd her husband owned a hardwa re store.  
The other, the Uncle Max brother owned 
what was called a luncheonette in New 
York which was a place with a fountain.  
You could get sandwiches or a sundae 
or some thing like that.  I think he probab
ly was different within his own family, 
different from all the others.  My brother 
felt that he had -- my brother liked him 
because he was serious and he would bring 
him books to read and things like that.  
I think he also took my brother ice -s
kating, for example, which my brother 
apparently hated.  I think he had a variety 
of things that he liked to do and he did 

go dancing with my mother.  As a matter of
 fact, I grew up with this funny thing.  
I thought that all people in 
Vienna ever did was to go ballroom dancing in white 
gowns and tails for the men.  Actually I 
love to do that; my husband and I do a lot 
of ballroom dancing in evening gowns a
nd tails.  I don™t know whether there™s a 
connection there but I think he was quite a 
serious person.  I think he really liked 
his work.  I think he was a good dentist.  
I think he was serious and interested in 
his patients. 
 

Q: Did he always run the practice out of 
his home or did he ever work for some one 
else, do you know? 
 

A: As far as I know, he always ran th
e practice out of our house.   There was 
some thing else I was going to say, but it 
just eluded me .  No, it wasn™t because 
you interrupt ed it™s just because I™m so fo
rgetful.  Well, I don™t remember  what I 
was going to say but I don™t re
ally know very mu ch else 
about my father.  I think 
he was probably a gentle, kindly sort
 of person. I think he was rather good-
looking.  He looks good-looking when he 
was young.  I have a picture of him 

around a cadaver on a dissecting table and 
he was rather good-looking then.  But 
then later on he got kind of stocky and 
I don™t know, to my mind, that didn™t look 
too great on him.  
 

Q: Do you have any me mories of any outi
ngs or anything that you ever took with 
him?  
 

A: No.  I don™t have any particular me mo
ries of my own.  I know that in the 
summers we used to go to the country and he would come  on weekends.  I know 
my brother, to this day, still talks abou
t those things in a some what mocki ng way, 
about how ma ny suitcases and porters my 
mother needed to go on those trips. I 
guess that™s really about all I can sa
y.  I know it seems weird to me  how 
circumstances shape people™s lives and about
 the fact that my father was in the 
Austrian army.  If he had been sensible to
 come  to the United States earlier, that 
he would have been probably in the 
American army because you know he would 
have been in that age gro
up where he still would have 
gotten drafted.  You™re sort 
of a pawn of the country that you
™re born in, in a funny kind of way. 
 
Q: But on the other hand, if they had rema in
ed in Austria, they probably would have 
been deported very early becau
se they were Polish born?  
 

A: Yes, right.  That™s -- I guess that™s 
about all I know.  I th
ink he was a rather 
serious person although I don™t think he™s as
 serious a person as my brother has 
turned out to be, ma ybe.  
I guess that™s about all I 
can say unless I think of 
something later. 
 

Q: Okay.  Is it all right with you if we are ab
le to use what we have about your father 
to represent his story as being a vict
im of the Holocaust to a large extent? 
 

A: Definitely.  I think not to 
a large extent, I think entirely. 
 
Q: So that we represent the suicide as a direct result? 

 

A: Oh, absolutely, yes, definitely. 

 

Q: All right, well tha
nk you very much.  It™s been very
 useful and I appreciate your 
time. 
 

A: Okay. 

 

                           TAPE 2 

 

Q: Okay, this is a test.  Do you want me  to do more? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: The date is Sunday March 29, 1992.  We ™re
 speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer 
about her parents.  What can you tell us, le
t™s start with your mo
ther, is that all 
right? 
 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: Can you tell us her name , her date of
 birth, he r place of birth, anything you know 
about her childhood, anything at all? 
 
A: Okay.  My mother™s name  was Klara Go
ttfried Reif. G-o-t-t-f-r-i-e-d,.  She was 
born in a small town in Poland, not far 
from Le mb erg which is now called Lvov.  
She was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady.  She often said that 
she -- I guess she didn™t get along with her fa
ther as well as with her mother.  She 
liked to run around and travel and do a lo
t of things.  She spoke several languages 
because when she was a child, the borders kept  changing and so at one point, 

where she was born, was part o Austria.  
I think both she and my father were 
actually Aust rian citizens because when 
they were born, Poland was a part of 
Austria, then the Russians came in.  She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think 

she spoke some Czechoslovakian and she mi ght have been conversant with a 

couple of other languages.  She alwa ys said
 she spoke five or seven languages, I 
never reme mber whether it™s five or seven. 
 

Q: Do you know what they spoke at home ?  

 

A: I think at home , they probably spoke a 
combination of Polish and Yiddish.  Yeah, 
I think that was correct.  My mother did 
a lot of traveling around.  She used to go 
to Lemberg to have clothes ma de and so on.  I think she went off to school at 

some  point also. 
 

Q: Do you know what kind of school?   Was it 
a Jewi sh school or a private school or 
a technical school? 
 
A: I don™t know.  No, it was definitely not 
a technical school and 
I don™t really know.  
I have a feeling it mi ght have been more 
like a finishing school or just some  kind 
of general school.  She definitely finish
ed gymna sium but did not go to college 
but she was pretty clever.  She was ver
y, very good with numbers and she did a 
lot of reading.  Anyw
ay at some -- I think she was 
very interested when she was 
young in fashion and that kind of thing.  At
 some  point she we nt off to Vienna 
either for a vacation or to have clot
he s ma de, I don™t know.  Some how a nd I don™t 
know how, but she me t my father.  Ultimately they got engaged and then they got 

ma rried, I think in 1925. 
 

Q: They got ma rried in Vienna? 

 

A: They got ma rried in Vienna, well, I™m 
not sure about that.  I™m not sure about 
that, they mi ght have gone back to Pola
nd to get ma rried.  But anyway, they lived 
in Vienna after they got married. Then
 in 1927, my brother was born.  Now my 
mother tells me  about her life in Vienna. 
 She said in the beginning it was kind of 
hard.  My father had been trained as 
a physician and then he went back and 
retrained as a dentist and 
he opened his practice.  Now one of the things my 
mother always told me  is that we lived 
in Este ______, that™s the first district in 

Vienna.  I guess that was not such a 
nice -- or the nices
t part of Vienna. 
_________ Excuse me , the Este _______ is where she would have liked to live  

She said that the reason they lived there was because my father™s office was in our 

house and that™s where he saw patients.  It
 was for reasons of 
the business that we 
lived there.  We lived actually, I guess
, right overlooking the Danube. So in the 
early years, she said things were difficu
lt and she helped my father.  She would do 
things like answer the phone and ma yb
e help prep patients and various other 
things. I guess my father did pretty we
ll fairly quickly and so things kind of 
perked up.  I think things were quite co
mfortable.  We  had -- I know there were 
about six people who used to come  and go 
in terms of ﬁservants.ﬂ  There was a 
cook who did our meals.  My brother and I each ha d a governess when we were 

kids. 
 

Q: Each? 

 

A Yeah, we are very far apart so it wasn
™t concurrent. There were one or two 
wome n who came in to do laundry.  You know
 in those days everything was a big 
deal.  I mean comi ng in to do the laundr
y was taking the sheets and boiling them 

up with soap and Clorox and so on and so forth. It was kind of a big thing and 

then even --.  We  did actually have a 
vacuum cleaner and I personally remember 
that these two cleaning women used to co
me  and they would roll up the rugs and 

take them up to the roof
 with these bamboo, oddl y shaped paddles and beat the 
hell out of the rugs.  There were these se
rvants around and at that point I think my 
mother sort of became a lady of leisur
e.  Again I don™t know which of these 

stories are true or apocry
phal but her role was to put
 on a white glove after the 
servants came  and go a r ound to ma ke sure th
at they had cleaned well.  I think she 
went and I think they did a fair amount of
 socializing.  I think they went to the 
opera and they would go dancing and go 
to the theater.  I know they went -- 
apparently once a week they went to play 
cards with this relative who actually -- 
the daughter lives in New York now.  They
 must  have done a lot of things like 
that.  I think my father was a fairly seri
ous person and my mother was probably a 
more -- I don™t know, a more frivolous pe
rson.  Actually my brother apparently 
didn™t do very well with my mother because he wa s a very se rious kid and he 

really liked my father.  But he thought 
my mother wasted her time even when he 
was very little.  Then --. 
 

Q: Can we back up just a little? 

 

A Yeah go ahead. 

 

Q: Do you know about her life in Poland be
fore she moved to Vienna?   Do you know 
about, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life?   We re they religious, we re they 

orthodox? 
 

A: I think her parents were
 orthodox.  I don™t know that my
 mother really -- I mean 
my mother always did al l the very traditional kinds of things but I™m not sure she 

really believed in any of that.  I don™
t know, she certainly had some  sorts of 
superstitions involved in 
Jewish religion but I have
 a funny feeling that she 
probably went along with the things.  I 
don™t think she and my father had -- we 
didn™t have a kosher house and we --.  I 
think they did go to services on the high 
holidays and things like that.  I™d be cu
rious to know whether we -- I™m sure we 
ate matzo on Passover but the real questi
on is did we also 
eat bread?   I don™t 
know what the answer is. 
 
Q: Was it ham on ma tzo? 

 

A: Right, right.  We ll, I™m sure we ate ham.
  I™ m abs olutely sure we ate ham.  We 
probably didn™t eat bread at
 Passover but it was not -- I 
don™t think it was terribly 
compulsive.  I think it was fairly casual. 
 I have a feeling that her father wa s 
probably not very casual and I don™t know about
 her mother.  I have a feeling that 
the mother was a more worldly woman and 
the father ma y have been a more sort 

of retiring   religious kind of person.  I 
think that my mother always felt that she 
was considered the black sheep.  Not by 
her mother, but by her father, that her 
father didn™t like her as we
ll as he liked the other tw
o kids.  I think she thought 
that was because she was sort of rebe lli
ous and didn™t do the th
ings that the other 
kids did.  Definitely, my mother™s brot
her and sister sound like more traditional 
kids.  They got ma rried and they had kids
 and they stayed, I think, in the same  
town, or nearby.  Here was this young chick going off to Vie nna and ma rrying 

strange people. 
 

Q: Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family? 
 

A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I reme mb er this very 
dramatically.  There was a blue letter
 that came  fr om some body, one of her 
relatives.  I think it mi ght have been 
this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went 
to live in Israel and whose son is in Isr
ael and is a physician, I think. Of course, I 
lost contact after my mo ther died.  I 
think the letter was 
from this guy Moshe 
Weinhaub.  It told in very great detail 
what happened to all 
the relatives.  Well, 
they all perished in one for m or another.
  Now my mother™s sister, that was the 
most dramatic thing.  Apparently they fo
rced her to watch while they threw her 

kids into an oven and then they shot her.
  That wa s really a horror story.  I think 
my mother™s brother and maybe the pare
nts -- I reme mber him describing that a 
lot of people in the camp  had typhoid.  
They purposely tried to contract typhoid 
and they did so they died of the typhoid.  They purposely di d that because they 

didn™t want  to die in what  they knew was awaiting them.  There were just 

descriptions of what happened to ev
erybody that he knew about.  I don™t know 
whatever happened to that letter.  As a ma tter of fact, it™s really weird.  This is my 

mother™s -- those two pieces of furniture 
are my mother™s.  Si nce my mot her died. 
I have not been able to find the key to th is.  Every once in a while, I try to get it 

open because  I keep thinking that ma ybethere are some letters and things in 

there.  I know I could probably get a lo
cksmith to open it but I probably have 
mi xed feelings.  Part of me  wants to 
know what™s behind those little doors and 
part of me  probably doesn™t.  But anyway, 
my  mo t h e r  --  I  t h in k  my  mo t h e r  w a s  a  
very, very different person after the wa
r from what she was before.  Although I 
can™t really judge that, 
that™s kind of a guess. 
 
Q: I ma de you jump.  Now why don™t we come
 back to the time that she had given 
birth to your brother, I guess? 
 
A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927.  My brother wa
s apparently a very serious little boy 
even at age two.  My mo ther always to
ld stories about how when she would go 
for a walk with him, instead of wanting to
 sort of play and 
so on, he would want 
to have her read the street signs.  Wh at
 does that say, how do you spell that, what 
are the letters?  And so on.  
That™s her perception.  My brother -- I have a picture 
of my brother sitting all 
dressed up with a little Lo
rd Fauntleroy tie in a sandbox 
with his rear end up -- sort of off the sa
nd so he wouldn™t get hims elf dirty.  My 
brother sort of tells, with some  resentme nt
, that he wasn™t allowed to be a little 
boy because they dressed him up and he always
 felt he couldn™t get dirty.  I think 
there were a lot of interes
ting dynami cs there. Then at 
age three, they started him 
on violin lessons. Some how it didn™t work out 
so they stopped at 
the advice of the 
teacher, I guess.  Then he  started again at
 the age five.  Then it really took hold 
very well and he really did play the vi
olin.  If you ask him, he™ll say, well you 
know, I™m not -- I can™t really 
play very well. But he really plays.  I me an for an 
amateur, he plays extremely well. Then when my father died -- well first my 

father got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking 

very bad in Europe.  I really should 
back up.  Starting in 1933. I think things 

started being politica
lly very hairy.  People had just 
come  out of a Depression.  As 
an aside, all my life, I was always rea
lly bothered that I mi ght have been an 
accident  because I™m seven and a half years younger than my brother.  

Subliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody 

which in retrospect seems 
silly.  But actually I wa s over forty once when I asked 
my brother, was I an accident?   My brot
her said, no, absolutely not.  Why did they 
wait so long?   Because of the Depressi
on.  I was born in 1934, in Novemb er and 
so things were --.  Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a 

kid because things were not looking good. 
 Did I send you the article I wrote for 
Boston Magazine? 
 

Q: You sent me  one about your cousin? 

 

A: I didn™t send you one from Boston Magazi
ne?  I should give that to you because 
that™s sort of about this subject.  Anyw
ay, so then I was born, and then things 
started getting bad. They got worse and wo
rse.  My father and mother started 
talking about the possi bility 
of going to America.  Appare
ntly my father just felt -
- in 1934 my father was already forty year
s old, right?  So his feeling was, how 
can I go to America?   I don™t know the 
language; I would have to retrain. We 
would get there and we would have not
hing so it just di
dn™t seem like a 
reasonable thing to do.  But then in Augus
t of 1938, I think it was, my father, like 
everybody else, had to close because Jews 
were not allowed to work any more.  
My father got really, really, very, very de
pressed.  My brother, I think my brother 
really still has and had all the time, a 
really treme ndous resentme nt about my 
mother not handling that ri
ght.  I™ve asked him about th
at and he says well, she 
used to say well you know you got to come
 out of this.  You can™t walk around 
like this.  She would kind of go off then 
and do whatever needed to be done.  I 
said to my brother, well what did you do?
  He said, well I reme mber standing in a 
dark room holding his hand, just quietly.  
Now that I™m at my present age and our 
kids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was 
just a very difficult situation for my  
mother.  How, if some body el
se is just very depresse
d all the time and you really 
don™t know how to get the person out of it, 
I think after a whil
e ma ybe it™s kind of 
a survival thing.  That you™ve got to ju
st keep doing what are your daily things 
because ot he rwise you™re going to go insane also.  I don™t know what was going 

on there but it was a really bad scenari
o, really very unpleasant things were 
happening to Jews.  I™m sure that my father
 mus t  have been extremely frightened.  

There™s a woma n who a c tually went to me
dical and then dental school with my 

father.  We  were always friendly with th
at family.  For example, that woman was 
forced to go out and scrub the streets and th
ings like that.  Al
l sorts of demeaning 
things happening and I think it must ha
ve been just  a terrible, terribl e time 
psychologically. 
 

Q: Until the time that he was forced to st op working, he worked regularly? 

 

A Yes, I think he did work regularly. 

 

Q: Even if ma ybe he was beginning to be 
depressed or whatever?   He didn™t --? 
 

A: No, I don™t think so.  I think he got ve
ry depressed after he
 had to close his 
practice.  Now I don™t know that for sure, 
I just know that from
 things that I™ve 
gathered.  Anyway, my moth
er, I think, tried to keepgoing about her business.  
Somewhere in this time span, they did decide
 that they would have to leave.  So 

they went and applied for visas and passports and so on.  On the morning of 

September 30, 1938, my father and mother ac
tually left the house together to go 
pick up those passports.  They picked 
up the passports and at about noontime, 
they parted to do separate chores.  They
 were supposed to meet, I think, at the 
home  of this cousin where they used to 
play cards.  Apparen
tly my father never 
got there.  I guess at about 2:30 in th
e afternoon, I seem to reme mber some body 
telling me , there was a phone call.  My fa
ther had been found at the bottom of a 
staircase.  I™m not sure whether he was al
ready dead or whether he died either on 
the way to the hospital or right after 
he got to the hospital. But the death 
certifi cate says he died of multiple fractures incl uding a fr actur ed skull and lots of 

fractured ribs.  All my life, I grew up th
inking that he had thrown hi ms elf off the 
top floor, the fourth floor of this -- down 
the stairwell.  There was a lot of trauma 
around that.  My mother did not want -- so
 the general consensu
s was that he had 
committed suicide.  My mother did no
t want anybody to know that and I don™t 
understand.  You know, it™s funny, children don™
t ask the right questions all the 
time.  I just took that on gospel and I never,
 ever said anyt hing until quite recently 
about that.  I never told it; I mean practic
ally no one did I tell this to. When I was 
discussi ng with my brother recently, he sai
d, well, I™ve never kept this a secret.  

Then a few years ago, when I started real
ly thinking about this; I started thinking, 
well, now how do we know he committed su
icide?   People say you™re just tryi ng 
to protect yourself from t his sort of 
thing.  First of all, I don™t have anything 
against this, I just don™t. 
 It wouldn™t -- in general 
it wouldn™t bother me  now.  I 
keep asking myself, does it bother me  if he
 did commit suicide.  I suppose in one 
way it doesn™t bother me  and in another 
way I think well this was sort of a 
shirking of your responsibility.  You know
 you had two kids and this was not the 
appropriate thing to do, to leave your wi
fe alone with these two kids.  My 
brother™s idea is that my father probabl
y did commit suicide and that one of the 
reasons that he did it, aside from bei
ng depressed and aside from -- I mean people 
were commi tting suicide right and left 
-- was that he probably figured that a 
woma n with two children would have a mu
ch better chance of escaping if there 

was no husband around.  At that time, mostly it wa s the me n who were being 

really harassed, initially.  
I don™t know but now as a scient
ist, I sort of stop and I 
think, well there was nobody there to see th
is.  All sorts of ho
rrible things were 
happening to Jews, how do we know what r
eally happened? Could he have been 

pushed?   I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide. The 

other thing is that I keep thinking wh
y would some body with a me dical profession 
who has access to much neater , cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself 

off a stairwell.  That™s another reason
 why I think that ma ybe he didn™t do it 
himself.  On the other hand, I suppose th
at when people commit suicide they™re 
not necessa rily being totally rational. 

 
Q: Right, the wa y some  people plan it out. 
 This sounds like it perhaps hadn™t been 
contemplated f or long, this 
specific act if it was? 
 

A: I don™t know but somebody recently pointed
 out to me that Primo Levi who was 
also a scientist and also had more so
phisticated means of committing suicide 
apparently also jumped off some thing or other. 
 

Q: Yes, he did. 

 

A: But anyway, the answer is I don™t know 
what happened.  When this happened, my 
mother was just totally devastat ed, just --. 
 

Q: Before we -- I hate to
 break your train of thought? 

 

A: No, go ahead.  I don™t mi nd. 

 

Q: Do you remember anything about her pe
rsonality before this time ?  When you 
were very, very young? 
 

A: No, I don™t reme mber very much about her except --.  I remember a few silly 
things like I used to like to go into th
e kitchen and dry the dishes for the cook.  
The cook would stand me  up on a l ittle stool
 and hand me  one dish at a time  and I 
would dry it.  I also liked to iron.  Y
ou know in those days there was no electric 
iron so they had those irons 
that you kind of had to keep putting on the stove until 
they get hot. I used to like to iron and my
 mother really didn™t like me to do those 
things.  I loved to do those things.  
Maybe she was already overly protective 
before the wa r, I™m not sure. 
 

Q: Do you still like to iron? 

 

A: No, I don™t like to iron.  I don™t mi nd but
 I don™t like to iron and I hate to dry 
dishes.  As a ma tter of fact, I think my mo
ther used to kid me  about because then -
-.  When we came to Ne w York and she wanted to help with those things she 

would tease me  and say you used to love 
to do it when I didn™t want you to.  Now 
when I want you to, you don™t want to do it.  
Well, it seems to me that it™s fairly 
self evident that it would be that way.  
Do I reme mber anything else about her?    

You know, I actually reme mber mo re about
 my interactions with the governess 
and the servants.  For example, the things  I reme mber about the servants is that 

they were fun for me .  The reasons they 
were fun was that they would come  in 
and do all these routine things.  Like 
we had a very long hallway because the 
apartment was two 7- room apartments 
with the wall broken down between them 
so there were 14 rooms. They all went 
off this long hallway.  We  had this rug, 
runner-rug, so they would roll that up
 every time  they came.  I don™t know 
whether it was every day or every other da
y or whatever.  They would let me  sit 

on the end of the runner.  Then they woul
d start rolling it, pull, roll, pull, so I™d 

get a ride.  Or if they we
re sweeping the floor, they™d 
let me  put my feet on the 
broom and s weep with me .  Or swing me  
back and forth and things like that.  
Those were kind of exciting things for me
 and I think my gove rness had a cot in 
my room.  I reme mber her being there; I reme mb er it was kind of a probably 
consoling feeling that -- I don™t know whethe
r she was there all the time  or what.  
I don™t ever reme mber the kind of thing of
 being left alone.  But then early on, I 

think I di d get left alone at night to sl
eep because  my brother tells me  I was an 
absolute royal pain, that I used to 
scream through the nights.  The governess 
would not let my mother come to me .  
I don™t really reme mbe r  a lot about my 
mother in those days and I certainly do 
not reme mber my father.  The funny thing 
is I reme mb er my father but then one day, when I must have been about ten or 

some thing, looking at this pict
ure of my father that my mothe r  always had on her 
night table and suddenly real
izing that the real memory
 of my father had been 
taken over by the me mor y of the picture. 
 I no longer had that real me mor y that I 
had originally.  I reme mb er my room in 
Vienna and I think I reme mber the dining 
room and I certainly remember the kitchen. 
 

Q: Do you want to describe them at all? 

 

A: Well the dining room, I seem to re me mber, it was kind of very for mal and dark.  
It seemed dark in there.  I don™t know wh
ether because there were curtains drawn 
or some thing.  We  did have in New York th
e table that was in that dining room.  
It was a dark, probably ma hogany or some
thing, ma ssive.  The furniture we had 

in Vienna was the sort of ma ssive thi
ng that was popular in the 1930™s.  I just 
reme mber the big table in the mi ddle and looking in there and it was -- just 

reme mber a sort of formal feeling.  The 
kitchen was sort of light and airy; there 
was this white --.  In Vienna there we
re no built in closets and so people had -- 
they were called wardrobes.  In the 
kitchen there was a 
white lacquered big 
wardrobe with two doors that opened with ke
ys, these kinds if old fashioned keys.   
I think the cook had like dish towels in there.  One me mory that became  very 

important for Kristallnacht -- she had -- a
nd actually I have one upstairs.  There 
were these little things you 
could buy, pasteels they were called.  They were sort 
of awful tasting things, mi nty or some thi
ng.  They came in either single boxes or 
triple boxes.  I don™t know if they were 
double sized ones but they were sort of 
green and gold cans.  The cook had a triple 
sized one of those in that white closet.  

Whenever she had extra goshen which are 
the equivalent of pennies she would 
put them into that can.  There must have
 been some  connection to me  about that 
can. I don™t know what it could have b
een, ma ybe she bought me  things with 
those occasionally or some thing.  But a
nyway, there was this long hallway and I 
reme mber my room quite well..  My 
room had a nice window which I think 
overlooked the river.  Then there was a dre
sser over there with a stuffed animal on 
it and then my crib which was not like an 
American crib but ha
d -- the part that 
goes up and down had a me sh of sort of 
ropes going both ways.  That was the way 
cribs were made in that time, I think.  Then there was this cot that  the governess 

used to ma ybe nap on or whatever.  I don™t 
think it was a very bi
g room but I sort 
of liked that room.  Then I reme mber my
 father™s office, my father™s examining 

room.  I re member the linoleum on the floor
 and that become s important for later 
when we back to Vienna in 1963 and I recognized that. But anyway so then the 
next -- my big me mory i s the night of Kristallnacht.  My mother was holding me  

up in her arms and my brother was holding 
-- of course my father was dead by 
now -- my brother was holding on to my mo
ther™s skirt.  There was this loud 
knock on the door and my mother said w
ho™s there and the superintendent was 
there.  Now I only reme mber the superi
ntendent and one other ma n.  But  my 
brother says there were actu
ally five or six me n who ca me .  My mother went to 

open the little me tal thing on the glass 
peephole and this guy smashed the glass 
with the back of a revolver.  The superi
ntendent said, let us
 in Mrs. Reif, we 
won™t hurt you.  They came  in and I reme mber being in the kitchen.  The only 

really strong me mory I have
 is of them taking that can full of coins.  They took, 
they helped themselves to everythi ng, a
ll the radios, anything that was of any 
value, they took.  Although befo
re that, interestingly, appa
rently either my  mother 
or some relative -- my father as a dentis
t ha d hunks of gold because in those days 
a lot of fillings were ma de with gold.  Some body went and dumped those in the 

bottom of the Danube.  Whatever else wa
s valuable in the house, these people 
helped themselves to.  I 
do think I reme mber one of the guys having a radio or 
some thing in his hand.  But the thing that 
I, as a little girl, felt most resentful 
about was that they took away
 this box of coins.  Th
ey left and then I don™t 
reme mber anything else about Vienna, I 
don™t think.  I think I may reme mber the 
little suit that  I wore when we got on to 
the ship, the San Luee but I™m not sure 

whether I reme mber that or I remember a 
picture that we have.  I actually have 
that outfit still.  I reme mber one othe
r thing.  After Kristallnacht, some how, I 
don™t know how it happened, but my mother 
ma naged to get these tickets to get 
on the San Luee.  The reason we got fi
rst class passage was because you were 
only allowed to take, I think it was like f
our dollars a person, out of the country 
.My mother figured, what the hell, we  mi ght as well go first class.  We  had to 

pack up stuff.  You were  a
llowed to send things away. 
 

Q: Sendabroad? 

 

A: Yes, but there regulations and I have a 
feeling that some  things got smuggled in.  
For example, a bunch of sterling silver flat
ware was in that van and I think that 
was strictly forbidden if I have read my 
history correctly.  But anyway my mother 
was not very -- my mother was really deva
stated -- I was going to say she wasn™t 
very functional but she obviously ma naged 
all right.  I think other people came 
and kind of had to help her do things.  There was a -- my brother had me t another 

boy called Irwin Kleinfeld who™s now a ma th
ematician at the University of Iowa 
in Iowa City.  Through that friendship, our parents kind of got to know his 

parents.  The father was a lawyer and somehow he came and helped my mother 

out with various things.  The day this 
enormous van pulled up in front of our 
building, he was there helping my mo ther ge
t stuff packed into this van.  I think 
my mother was not doing very well and he 
kind of said, take this, take that.  I 
don™t know who ma de the final decisions, I ha
ve a feeling that he ma de a lot of 
them.  There were some really weird thi
ngs in this van, just really weird.  For 

example, we  had one room in Vienna th
at was totally covered apparently in 
mi rrors.  It was ma de out of these tiles that were about eight 
inches wide by about 
fourteen inches high.  One of the things th
at came out of this van, when we got it 
in New York three years later, was al
l these mi rrors.  Now what did anybody 
think we were going to do with these mi rrors
!  So that was in there.  We ird things, 
on my second birthday, I had been bought a ve
ry special doll.  That doll arrived in 
New York, speaking of trauma tizing kids
, it was hung by the neck from the bar 
inside one of the wardrobe
s with all the clothes and so on.  This guy, I reme mber 
that day, I reme mber this guy comi ng and 
I reme mber these things going out into 
this van. That van went to New York a
nd it sat in a warehouse which I think was 
paid for by my aunt Lena or ma ybe we sent -- I don™t know.  Then I don™t 
reme mber that trip except for being seasic
k.  Then we were sent back to Europe 
and we went to France.  That™s where my
 memor i es start again.  The first thing 
that happened was -- am I on track?  -- is
 this the kind of st
uff you want to hear? 
 

Q: Yeah, since I already have a lot of th
is, of the facts, do you know any of your 
mother™s responses to these 
things?   Or her f
eelings -- how did she respond being 
in France when you --? 
 

A :  T h e  t h i n g  t h a t  I  re me mb e r  i s  t h a t  my  mo t h e r  - -  my  r e me mb r a n c e  o f  my  mo t h e r  
was that she was, to a large extent for y
ears and years, in a st
ate of -- I don™t know 
what to call it --  in a state of somebo
dy who™s just been through a catastrophe 
which she had been.  It™s just that most
 people seem to recover more rapidly and 
she just did not recover.  She recovered e
ffectively in that she always seemed to 

do the right thing to get to the next step
 but emotionally she never recovered.  So 
my recollection of my mother
 through most of these year
s is that she was often a 
very sad person, it was like a lot of sighi
ng and just this unhappy demeanor on her 
face, for years.  She also, in later years, so
me  of that lifted and she could be a real 
fun person some times.  It was almost we
ird and I couldn™t even begin to go 
through this until ve ry recently.  But now 
I have a feeling that if some body had 
some how just let her or encouraged her,
 she could have been a really vibrant 
dazzling lady.  Occasiona lly she would 
dance with me , not very often but 

occasionally.  She was very good in later 
years like after I met Sam and we got 
ma rried and everything.  She was always 
game  for anything, fly on a jet; yeah, I™ll 
fly on a jet.  She didn™t have any of 
these hang-ups like other parents of my 

contemporaries.  You know, they wouldn™t 
ride an escalator.  She came, e ven 
when she was sixty, she climbed with us 
in Yosemite but there was always this 

real sadness.  I reme mbe r  once when shewas already starting to get Alzheime r™s 

disease, she said this to me  very ofte n 
but this particular time I reme mber it very 
dramatically.  She said, I™ve only had th
irteen good years in
 my whole life and 
those were the fi rst thirteen 
years with my father is what she was referring to.  We  
were not very nice children to her.  
We were extremely hard on her for many 
reasons.  First of all, my brother thought
 she was frivolous, I probably thought she 

was a little frivolous also although she wa
s very sad and serious.  She always 
seemed to be concerned about things th
at -- I don™t know how we got to be so 
lofty thinking but she always seeme d to 
be concerned with things that we felt 

were not terribly important.  One would 
say that there was friction because  we 
just totally lorded it over her.  It was r eally, as I think back on it now, was a very 
strange situation. 
 

Q: Let me flip it over. 

 

                             END OF SIDE A, TAPE 2 

 

A: Is it going now? 

 

Q: Now we™re on. 

 

A: Okay.  She was very, very encouraging of our studying and doing well for 
ourselves but she didn™t dema nd enough for he
rself.  I can say th
is in retrospect.  
For example, my brother had a room to
 hims elf in New York -- I™m skipping 
ahead now but -- and I didn™t.  I shared 
a room with her and I did my home work 
in the kitchen.  She™d come  home tired 
from wor k, she would ma ke dinner, she 
would clean up and then I had the audacity
 to tell her that  she couldn™t run the 
water to wash the dishes while I was doi
ng my home work.  She went along with 

that!  That was really -- in retrospect 
that was sort of amazing.  She should have 
told me  whe r e to get off.  She did get after me  to help often and I some times tried 

to help a little but I -- it™s f
unny you know now, do you have children? 
 

Q: No, not yet. 

 

A: You see this thing reflected in your 
children.  I mean she would say, would you 
dry the dishes?   I would sa
y yes I™ll dry the dishes as soon as I finish my  
home work.  Then she would say -- she 
couldn™t wait till I fini shed because she 
was very me thodical about all the househol
d things.  So she would dry the dishes, 
so most of t he time I never got to do it. 
 I would have done it if she had waited but 

she couldn™t wait.  Now as a parent I can
 sense that irritati
on of I want it done 
now and the kid wants to do it later.  It™s
 just that I sort 
of know enough to know 
that if I really don™t want to do it and I wa
nt the kid to do it, you just leave it and 
let the kid do it later. 
 

Q: Did she have any interests?   You said 
she enjoyed dancing and things like that?   
You me ntioned that there was opera -- di
d she follow anything closely?  Have 
hobbies or anything? 
 

A: No, I don™t think so.  She actually, she wa
s fantastic with her hands.  In Europe 
when she was a lady of leisure she did embroi
dery, that™s what ladies did.  She did 
that whole thing, that™s all silk petite poi
nt.  It took her two years to do that.  We  

were such terrible kids.  We both used 
to tease her about why did you spend all 
this time  doing this really disgusting-looking scene?   Why didn™t you at least pick 

some --?  First of all, now it™s still looks 
like --.  I still think 
why did she spend all 
this time  doing this scene but it doesn™t 
look as bad as it used to look.  Now I 

really appreciate the time and the ener
gy and the devotion and the workmanship.  
There are lots of things around the house th
at she did.  Later on it became  things 
that we tried to get her to do to k
eep her busy.  She di
dn™t know, I don™t know 
how she did this in Vienna.  I think in Vienna she probably picked this up 
whenever she had time and then put it dow
n and so on.  In the time that I really 
knew her, she didn™t know how to relax excep
t to read.  She did a lot of reading.  
I™m not always sure that -- she read in
 a funny way.  She did not read like an 
educated person.  She read in a way that
 was non-analytical.  We, the children, 
who both turned out to be Ph.D. scientists found this really weird. 
 

Q: How do you mean non-analytical?  Readi
ng fiction in a non-analytical way?   I 
have to defend the huma nities. 
 

A: Well the best way and this ma y even be 
an unfair way to say but one of the things 
that I reme mber and this had nothing to do 
with reading but rather with a movie, 
she was here baby sitting for us.  She 
had seen a movie called ‚I Never Sa ng For 
My Father™.  My husband and I were goi
ng out to see it that night.  When we 
came home, almost simu ltaneously my hus
band and I said boy, what a mi serable 
father.  At the same mo ment she said, wasn
™t that a mi serable son?   I™m sure it 
could be interpreted both ways but I think 
any -- if you looked at the critics which 
I don™t think I ever did of that movie -- I 
think the whole point of that movie is 
that here is a parent who is ma nipulating 
the son in such a way that the son™s life 
becomes ruined.  My mo ther totally mi
ssed that, all she could see was the bad 

son, not being nice to the daddy. 
 

Q: I see what you mean. 
 
A: Or for example, after our kids were 
born, I would keep giving her books to read 
about child rearing.  Every time she finish
ed one, she™d say, ah, this is really 
interesting.  This is great.  I wish I ha
d known about this when you were small.  
But then ten mi nutes later she would go a
nd totally interact 
by her gut reaction 
rather than by what she had just read 
about.  We  would get into some  really 
ridiculous argume nts, she and I.  Late
r on, after I got my Ph.D. and got a job, 
because she worked like a ma d dog i n the f
actories -- she had incredible pr ide in 
her work.  She not only did what she had 
to do but she worked harder because she 
wanted everything to be just 
right.  We pretty much had 
to insist that she retire 
and my brother and I each gave her 
money.  We ll, she never could feel 
comfortable with getting m
oney from us.  We  would say look, you struggled like 
mad to support us.  Did we ever complain
 about that?   No, we just took the money 
and we lived happily ever after.  No
w it™s your turn to have a good time and 

retire.  We  are doing quite well, we are 
in no way being hurt by giving you this 
money.  Wh y don™t you just ta
ke the money and enjoy it.
  You™ve had a really 
hard life, now™s the time  to have a good 
time.  She could never cope with that.  
Every mont h when the checks came, there was a struggle about whether she was 

going to keep these checks.  But then also
 when she did retire, she was lonesome , 
what was she going to do with her time ?   
Sa m and I used to devise these projects 

for her to do.  One time she said she r
eally needed a bookcase.
  We bought her an 
unfinished bookcase and some  varnish and shel
lac and the rest  of it.  We said well 
this ought to keep her busy for a week or 
two.  We told her how to do this and so 
on.  Two days later or three days later, sh
e calls up, I finished the bookcase.  What 
do you mean, you finished the bookcase.  Y
ou have to wait at least so ma ny hours 
in between.  She said, oh I did.  It said 
wait five hours so I set the alarm clock 
when I went to sleep and at five hours I got up and I put on the next coat and so 
on.  Everything was like some thing she ha
d to do.  All right, I™ll give her 
some thing better to do so I gave her th
is enor mo us piece of rug me sh, to hook a 
rug which is now hanging on our wall.  I 
thought well this has got to keep her 
busy for a while.  After a few weeks, she came back.  It was all finished.  She 

said, you know this was really very har
d.  My hands were bleeding along the sides 

from working on this.  Everything we tried to do to occupy her time in a nice way 

-- but on the other hand she also
 did very well.  She must have gone to every free 

concert in Ne w York and free plays and 
so on.  She would start talking to younger 
people, other people found her very delight
ful because they didn™t have to grow 
up with her.  So none of those irritations we
re there but it was very hard for her to 
ma ke friends.  The only people that she ma
de friends with were other ladies like 
her from Vienna.  It was hard to find t
hose as the years went on.  Even with those 
people, she was very critical and so if
 they did some thing wrong, she would get 
very annoyed or insulted or --.  You were going to ask some thing? 
 

Q: Did she speak German with you and your br
other or with these 
other people?   Did 
she prefer to speak German? 
 

A: She did speak German with them, ye ah. 
 She did speak German with us for a long 
time.  I think in the later years, after 
our kids were born, she probably spoke more 
English.  When we first came here, she 
had all these books and every night she™d 
come home from work, she™d be exhaus
ted.  She would ma ke dinner, she would 
clean up, she would get into bed, she w
ould study her English.  She was very 

thorough; she had these little
 notebooks about this si
ze that she would keep.  
Every night she would write down everythi
ng she spent that day in that notebook.  
She would add it up and then she would c
ount what was in her change purse and 
her wallet.  If it was off by even one cent
, even if it was late at night, she would 
go through the whole thing as ma ny times as 
it took, to balance that perfectly.  It 
could not be off by one penny.  Then funny things happened.  One time I 

reme mber -- you know how you get into silly discussions about -- she had bought 

me  this dress and I said it cost so much and she said no, it was so much.  She just 

went and got her little thi
ng of little books and looked 
it up and there it was with 
the date and how much it was.  Gray dress 
with white stripes.  She was really, she 
was almost compulsive about keeping the 
records.  Every Saturday was cleaning 
day.  Come  heaven, hell or high water,
 the house got cleaned on Saturday from 

top to bottom. I got involved in that and 
sometimes I felt resentful about that .  It 
was a gorgeous Saturday and from nine
 in the morning until three in the 
afternoon, we cleaned house -- washed the 
floors, everything.  
I want to go back 
to France, right? 

 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: In France, my mother was not doing ve
ry well. With all the languages she could 
speak, she never learned to speak French because she was just so emotionally 

devastated and in France, when we fi rst got
 to Ludern we lived in this hotel.  
There were a whole bunch of about twenty re
fugees who were put up at this hotel.  
She was really -- in addition to things be
ing bad, she was upset about all sorts of 
mi nor things.  Like in the kitchen of the 
hotel, there were cats
 and the cats were 
allowed to walk on the food table. Well, 
I get bothered about that also but under 
those circumstances --. She went to as
k the woman who ran the hotel where is 

there a public bath.  There was no bathroom
, there were toilets but no bathroom in 
this hotel.  The woma n didn™t know.  This
 blew my mother™s mi nd, how could she 
not know!  This woman, like a lot of othe
r French wome n, would put on a lot of 

perfume.  My mother was always -- g-d, 
she must be filthy.  I™m sure she sponged 
-bathed and so on but anyway
 -- so my mother was really bothered by things like 
that.  I reme mber that hotel very well. 
 Then after we had been there -- I had a 
little boyfriend whose name  was Jac
ques Paul Berg and I just --. 
 

Q: He was in the picture you sent me . 

 

A: Right, and he apparently perished.  
I don™t know what that meant having a little 
boyfriend but I think he was just my frie
nd. We  played together. Then the other 
thing I remember fr om that time, this wa
s really weird stuff.  I reme mber there 

were these two girls who forced me to watch the hotel cooks kill a chicken in the 

back of the hotel.  I just 
cried and cried, I was really
 upset.  Just around the time 
of the San Luee reunion in 1989, I coincide
ntally me t these two wome n who were 
the two girls.  They said well ther e were
n™t any other children so it must have 
been us.  Yes, it sounds like the kind 
of thing we would have done.  They 
actually, those people if you could get to
 interview them, it would be very 
interesting, because those tw
o sisters have diametrically opposite stories about 
what happened in France.  Not the facts, 
but the attitudes are just diametrically 
opposite. 
 

Q: Do you remember their name s?  

 

A: Yes.  First of all their unma rried last
 name  was Isner. I-s-n-e-r. The younger one 
is Ruth Isner Kissinger and her husband is
 actually a first cousin of Henry 
Kissinger.  The other is Bella and sh
e remarried.  I don™t remember what 
happened to her husband.  She™s now Bella
 Isner Uhlfelder U-h-l-f-e-l-d-e-r.  
Ruth Isner is, I found her very
 easy to talk to.  Actually
 Bella was originally easier 
to talk to.   Ruth is a mo re reticen
t person but Ruth has been much more 
cooperative with me  about collecting stu
ff for my  book.  Bella got ma d at me  for 

some  really dodo thing at the reunion.  
Because I got up and announced that I was 
doing this book and she accused me  of ma ki
ng this very emotional thing into a 
commercial affair.  I don™t know but anyway
 I have not gotten a story from Bella 

but I have one from Ruth Isner.  I thi
nk it will be very interesting to interview 
both of these sisters. 
 
Q: Where do they live, in New York? 

 

A: Yeah, they both live in --. No, she lives
 in New Jersey, Bella lives in, I think, the 
Bronx or uptown Manhattan but some where in the 100™s. Anyway, so we spend 

almost a year there, just  short of a ye
ar.  Then one morning the Germans came in 
and took the town.  I reme mber that because we woke up and they were pa rading 

around.  Shooting into the air and just being 
generally very noisy. 
 The thing that I 
reme mber was I was a very goody-goody little girl.  I™d always been taught, you 

don™t lie, you don™t this, you don™
t that. I was told that noway was I allowed to let 
on that I could speak German.  The generals, I guess, actually came and lived in 

the hotel so for about two weeks, we were
 together.  I reme mber being totally -- I 
thought that this was really weird -- that
 you™re not supposed to lie but here I am 
and I can understand everything all these guys
 say.  Every time  they talk to me  
I™m standing there saying _________.  My br
other now tells me  that one day my 
brother just  had his heart in his mouth b
ecause one of these guys came up to me, 

started to talk to me  and my brother sa
w me start to answer in German.  He 
became petrified and he said at the 
last mi nute, I suddenly must have 
reme mbered, and I said _________. But that was a very important time in my life 

because there was a young German s oldier ther
e.  I don™t really reme mber his face 
except it was a very nice f
ace.  He had sandy colored hair; I don™t know if I could 
have judged but as I think back he 
must have been 18 or 19.  There was 
some thing very pleasing about this kid. 
 Every morning they did these stupid 
ma neuvers around this hotel and we woul
d watch from our window which looked 
out over the side.  This guy would throw 
me  candies and things; my mother was 
always sure they were poisoned and di
dn™t want me  to eat them but you know I 
didn™t get stuff like that.  So I ate it and he
re I am.  Then he ultimately gave me  a 
little doll which I trea
sured for a long time.  Now I don™t know whether this is true 
or not but in my mi nd, that soldier was 
unbelievably important.  Because when I 
came to the United Stat es, the kids -- well 
first of all kids ar
e brutal.  The kids 
were really brutal.  First of all ev
erybody was making fun of me  because I 
couldn™t speak English.  Even some  
of the parents in the neighborhood in 
Brooklyn were not really ve
ry kindly which I find kind of shocking.  The kids 
would come  over t me  and even the adults and say, do you hate the Germans?   

Even as a kid, I was seven, I would say 
no, I don™t hate the Germans. There are 
good Germa ns and there are bad Germans.  Th
e r eason I was able to say that must 
have had to do -- probably also had to do w
ith discussions with my brother -- but  

I think it had a lot to do with th
is soldier.  It really wasn
™t until very recently that I 
started thinking.  We ll was this soldier 
-- well I always some how, in my life, 

assume d that that soldier knew I was Jewish.  But recently I thought,, well, did he 

know?   Maybe he didn™t know, ma ybe he wa
s just being ni ce to me  because he 
thought I was a cute little Catholic kid.  But 
the point is, it™s irrelevant it™s what 

that guy represented to me, throughout my 
life whether it was re
al or not real.  
That I think was incred
ibly important about that particular stage.  Then there was 

a lot of talk between my mo
ther and my brother about 
what™s to be done.   You 
can™t stay here because I don™t know how 
my mother managed to -- I mean my 
mother couldn™t even talk one word in French.  How could she carry this ruse on 
for two weeks of us ma king believe that 
we couldn™t speak German.  I don™t know 
how we ma naged to get through that.  A
pparently, according to my mother, my 
mother says that my brother said to 
her one day, I™m leaving here whether you 
leave or not.  Now my br other doesn™t qui
te reme mber saying anything quite so 
dramatic but in the meantime apparently
 my brother tells me that there are 
meetings amongst these twenty refugees. 
 As a group, they decided to get out.  
Now there was only one fa mily, I heard about this for years, there was one fa mily 

who decided not to leave.  I never knew who that was until 1989; it was this 

fa mily, these sisters.  That was obviously the wrong move because they didn™t get 

out until ™46 or ™47.  We  left all our stu
ff in this hotel except for a couple of pairs 
of underwear and my br other™s violin.  We
 went very late at night, I remember 
walking to the train station.  It was dark
 and I think it was mi dnight.  We went to 
the train station and I didn™t reme mbe r  th
at there were 20 of us or 18 of us or 
whatever it was; I only reme mber my moth
er and my brother and me  wa lking to 
the train st ation.  We  took the train.  
My brother has filled me  in on the funny 
things that happened along the way and 
how we actually got across the border by 
-- it was just luck and a ruse. The next
 thing I remember is being in Limoges 
which is the town in southern France  whic
h is famous for it™s china.  I think that 
first night we actually must have slept in th
e railroad station and 
I slept on a scale.  
There was a scale in the railroad stati
on.  Then we got put up and I thought it was 
just for one night but my br
other says we were there for six weeks.  You can see 
that my me mory is distorted compared to 
his.  But we got put up in the concrete 
bleachers of a stadium for the circus.  
 

Q: Yeah, you told me  this, right? 

 

A: Then ultimately some people got together
 and rented these two rooms.  The rooms 
were each ma ybe about two or three time s 
as big as this room.  There were 30 
wome n in the room downstairs and I think 
I was the only child.  We  live in there 
for several months and all the guys lived ups
tairs.  I think my brother was the only 
child upstairs, the only one of the me n who was a boy. 
 

Q: What did your mother do there, when you were there? 

 

A: Nobody could do anything. 

 

Q: You just hung around --? 

 

A: I seem to reme mber them being pretty busy cleaning up.  They were alwa ys 
cleaning up.  In the nighttime we had th
ese straw sacks that we put down on the 
floor and we slept on.  In the morning, 
we piled them up against the wall and 
there were these crates, like or ange crates
 and we ™d put those down as tables and 
chairs. People were always sweepin
g and cleaning and walking down, every 

morning we walked down --.  I was allowe
d to get about three inches worth of 
milk in a coke-sized bottle.  My mother ma
de me share that with my brother.  You 
had to walk to the store and they measur
ed this out, walk back.  There were 
always walks begging for bread in the bake
ry.  That was my job, I think I told you 
about that. 
 
Q: Right, it was cute. 

 

A: Just last year, when I was interviewi
ng my brother, I said to him, did anybody 
think how demeaning this was to me ?   My
 brother looked at me
 and he s a id it 
wasn™t demeaning, it was bread.  I have a 
sign in my office that says that because 
it remi nds me of some thing.  Anywa y that
™s where I went to school for the first 
year.  I think it was a very lonesome  
time for me .  There weren™t, some how, I 
don™t think I played with the other kids after school.  They lived some  place else, 

we were refugees which was pr
obably not a nice thing to be. 
 

Q: Do you know about your mother?   Di d 
she interact with 
the other people? 
 

A: Well she interact ed with the other women. 

 

Q: You know how you said, she basically be
gan to change or whatever.  Do you 
think she was in this --? 
 

A: She defi nitely interacted with the ot he
r wome n but I have a feeling that she ma y 
not have been terribly popular.  She wa
s emotionally a downer a lot of the time, 

she was alwa ys sad.  A lot of other people -- 
I think that™s true of my brother also.  
When we got on the San Luee, apparently mot people -- when the ship sailed 

away, and the captain said 
all right, these people are goi
ng to be treated like all 
people who are on a tour, people were re
joicing and dancing 
and doing all these 
other things which my mother was not par
ticipating in.  Which 
my brother, even 
though he was about 11 or 12 at the time , sa
id he was really bothered that these 
people were being so insensitive.  That th
ey had left people behind in dire straits, 

that they had just come from being in dire
 straits and it was not a time  to dance or 
sing.  We ll my adult me  can see it both ways; yeah, it™s not a time to dance and 

sing.  On the other hand, I can see where,
 if you™ve been really hurting for so 
long, and there™s an opportunity to do 
some thing different, then ma ybe it ma kes 

good me ntal health sense to try to take a
dvantage of this.  I 
think we spent our 
time on the ship rather quietly.  I mu st have
 played with the other kids and there™s 
a picture that I sent you a copy of and th
ere seemed to be quite a lot of kids 
though most of them, I t hink, were older a
nd there were a few babies.  In Limoges 
I went to school and I have a feeling th
at I was kind of lonesome  but there was 
some  -- I reme mber some  really nice things.  Like there was a carpenter who 

couldn™t work most of t he time and he made 
me this wonderful li
ttle set of red and 
blue furniture, tables and chairs and he 
ma de upholstery things
 with little pieces 
of wallpaper and so on.  That was a rea
lly nice thought.  Then 
after a few months, 
two rooms next door to the two rooms 
we had, became available.  I don™t know 

why but some how my mother was chosen or
 some how got to have the smaller of 
the two rooms with us.  We didn™t have to
 sleep on the floor, we
 could put our -- 
they were like orange crate beds that
 some body had put together.  We  could put 
our straw bags on those.  That™s where 
I had real measles in that room and I 
reme mber that very dr amatically.  I reme
mber for two weeks lying on my back in 
this room with a dark curtain dr aw
n because I was do photophobic and watching 
the mold grow on the ceiling and the drip
s come  and drip down.  For two weeks I 
was lying there like that.  The two c
ouples who got the outer room, were two 
sisters ma rried to two brothers.  One of 
those brothers was almost blind and he 
some how, even though I think this wa s illega
l, he ma naged to find some  leather.  
He would punch out those pieces of leathe
r that you ma ke the belts that hook onto 
each other.  My brother a
nd I would someti mes help him and I liked doing that 
especially because I think he used to tell
 us stor ies while we sa t and work.  We 
would sit at this little window and we woul
d ma ke these belts.  That was kind of a 
pleasant thing for me. 
 
Q: Is there anything else you can think 
of about your mother?   Because I know, 
basically when we write this ID, we 
will stop when you get o America because 
that™s the Holocaust  --.  Is ther e anyt
hing else you can think of to fill in? 
 

A: I think my mother was extremely so mb
er in those days.  I reme mber going for 
some  long walks to try to get food a
nd I reme mbe r  those as being somber 
occasions.  I ma y be totally wrong but I don™t reme mber any laughter or  --.  The 

only way I can present her personality really
 is to tell you about after we came  to 
America because I think it must have been 
worse in France.  My mother imagined 
herself a really aristocratic
 lady -- that™s the way she t
hought of herself.  When my 
aunt Lena and -- actually it was her kids
 who came  with he
r -- brought us from 
the boat to her house --.  She lived in the lo
wer East Side and I 
was sitting next to 
my mother in the back seat and my brothe
r was sitting next to me .  As we drove 
into the lower East Si de with the push- 
carts and this sort 
of ma ss of humanity, 
my mother whispered, for this I™ve struggl
ed all these years.  I thought oh my G-
d, what a terrible thing to say.  Even t
hough ma ybe I was also feeling part of that, 
ma ybe I was  worried that some one was going to
 hear or what but she just --.  We  
lived with my aunt for three months.  
My aunt got sick at
 one point and in 
retrospect we should have been really 
grateful for being put up.  I think my 
mother really was very grateful but at th
e same  time , when my aunt got sick and 
needed somebody to ma ke her a cup of tea, 
my mother had no id
ea how to ma ke a 
cup of tea because she™d been so --.  Part 
of that had to be a put-up job because in 
France, in those two years, everybody wa
s struggling ma king meals and so on.  I 
think it was more ma ybe  when she was 
asked to ma ke cereal or some thing, she 
had never done that, she hadn™t a clue 
and so on.  But she was a very giving 

person and so when we finally got an apar
tment after three months and I think she 
was earning $35 or $45 a month, something lik e that -- no wait a mi nute -- what 

was she earni ng? She was earning $15 a wee
k, that™s what it was and the rent was 
$45 a month.  She would buy things for us.  Some times she™d even come home 

with a little treat for us a
nd she was living on toast and toma toes.  It was all for us.  

She wore black for years and years and year
s; it wasn™t until -- I don™t know when 
it happene d that she would occasionally put
 on some thing red; but for years --.  
Then there was that whole struggle of wh
en I tried to put on some thing black.  
She would say there will be time enough 
for that, don™t wear -- if you have to 
wear black, put on a flower or some thing 
like that.  She often complained about 
her state in life and I don™t blame her but 
she didn™t have any guidance.  She could 
have had a fantastically better life, she 
could have been a fantastic bookkeeper but 
nobody guided her so she ended up leading he
r life in the factories which she 
hated.  It wasn™t so much the work as 
it was the demeaning atmosphere.  She felt 
that she was with these uneducated, boorish people who -- I think occasionally 

even people ma de passes at her which sh
e found --.  She was so Victorian that 
even when she was in the nursing home  -- no it wasn™t the nursing home.  It was 

when she was living in a senior citiz
ens™ thing, when we mo ved her up to 
Brookline and she belonged to some  golden age club.  I think she was 80 by then.  

One day she called me up and it was rain
ing and she said, some  80 -year- old ma n 
offered her a ride back to her apartmen
t.  I said good, did you take it? Who do you 
think I am?  Would I take a ride with a st
range man?   So she 
had this ima ge of 
herself, she never would have thoughtof getting remarried.  She wouldn™t, the 

idea of, no ma n was allowed to touch her 
except  my father.  She had a terribl e 
time getting used to America because one 
time she came in for a job interview or 
some thing and the boss was sitting on hi
s chair with his feet up on the desk.  
Well, she thought that that was treating her 
in a terrible way or for example, when 
people would call her by her first name  w
ithout being invited.  In Vienna she was 
Frau Doctor Reif and the least she expected
 was to be Mrs. Re if.  She had a lot of 

those -- she was just very European.  
But she also -- she adapted very well in 
other ways.  She got to be really goo
d at shopping and knowing where to get 
bargains.  She was very, she was alwa ys very
 energetic.  It™s 
just that she didn™t 
always channel her energy.  Like when sh
e went to work in New York in the 
morning, she would get up I think at six in
 the morning in order to be able to 
leave the house at a quarter to eight.  
During that time , she mu st have expended, I 
mean you could have built a house with th
e amount of energy she expended just 
in the process of getting herself dressed, 
ma keup and a hat and hat pins, stockings 
and shoes and all these things.  Then she™d 
get to Manhattan and 
take it all off and 
put on some  work clothes that she had at 
the factory.  Then she™d put it all back 

on to take the subway back home. 
 What else do you want to know? 
 

Q: I think that™s painting a very nice picture and I think we definitely know -- 
because we have the st ory line. 
 

A: Let me add one more thing because 
I don™t want to leave you with the wrong 
impression.  She also, she was very good- 
natured like she™d play cards with me , 

if I was bored, she™d play cards with me .-
  Or if I needed to me morize a poem for 
school, even though she was exhausted, she w
ould sit up in bed at night and have 
me  recite over and over again.  Wa s that
 IF by Roger Kipling, I just reme mber 
that one in particular, but ma ny things 
like that; she was really very good about 

always trying to do things to try to make
 me  happy.  I think there was a really fun 
loving person there that never got to 
come  out because of the way life went. 
 
Q: Okay.  We ll, thank you very much.  This is the end.
