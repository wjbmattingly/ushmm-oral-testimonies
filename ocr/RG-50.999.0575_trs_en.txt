the Holoc aus t.We have pr epar ed a br ief s lide pres entation to help with his  intr oduction.
 
 
We begin with this photograph of Marty Weis s , whic h was  taken after the war. Marty was  bor n 
in
 
Czec hos lovakia in a town c alled Polana in 1929. Czec hos lovakia is  highlighted on this  m ap of 
Europe.
 
 
In 1939, Germany oc c upied half of Czec hos lovakia and Hungary, the other half. After the 
Germ an invas ion of the Soviet Union in 1941, c onditions  in Polana
 
wors ened. By April
 
1944, Marty's  
fam ily was  tr ansported to the Munkac s  ghetto. The arrow on this  map of Czec hos lovakia points to 

Munkac s .
 
 
In May, they were deported to Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau killing c enter where Mar ty and other fam ily 
m em bers  wer e c hos en for
 
s lave labor. The first ar r ow points  to the loc ation of Aus c hwitz.
 
Later, Mar ty 
and his  family wer e s ent to the Mauthaus en c oncentr ation c am p in Austria. Our s ec ond arr ow points  to 
the loc ation of Mauthaus en.
 
 
This  is a photogr aph of roc k s  that wer e taken out of the quarr y by s lave labor er s at the 
Mauthausen c am p.

Her e we s ee a doc um ent that was  unc overed only r ec ently in our  arc hives  in whic h was  new

Regis tration Card whic h doc um ents  Marty's  transfer  fr om Aus c hwitz on May
 
22, 1944, to the 
Mauthaus en c am p. His  pr is oner  number appeared in the upper r ight

After the war , Mar ty m oved to the United States. He s erved in the United States Arm y dur ing 
the Kor ean War follow

Marty's  wife, J oan, pas sed away in 2013. Mar ty and J oan have two c hildren and four 
grandc hildr en. And one of their  grandc hildr en just c om pleted law s c hool.
 
 
Marty has  been a volunteer  here at the m us eum for the pas t 17 years. In addition to leading 
groups  of students  and FBI agents  through the mus eum , Marty is  ac tive with the Speakers  Bureau. He 
has  s poken to diver s e audienc es  inc luding at U.S. military bas es

Marty als o recently traveled at the invitation of the Aus tr ian gover nment to the 
former 
Mauthausen c onc entration c am p, whic h is  now a memor ial s erving as an ins titution for  lear ning about 

the Holoc aus t. And he is a c ontr ibutor to "Ec hoes  of Memory," a c ollec tion of wr itings by s urvivor s

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you s o mu
c h f
or joining us and your  willingnes s  to be
 
our Firs t Pers on today. 
We have s o much to go over in a s hort hour.
 
 
Marty, you told me about your life in Czec hos lovakia as  a c hild r ight before the war. Let's s tart 
today first with you telling us  about your family, about your c omm unity, about your s elf in thos e year s  
before the war began.
 
> > Mar tin Weis s :  Ok . My fam ily
 
--
 
by the way, I cam e fr om a sm all town. Ac tually, it wa
s a village. It 
was  in the 1930s. As I was  going out
 
--
 
by the way, I c ame from a fam ily of nine c hildren. I was number 
s even. By t
he tim e I was  growing up
 
--
 
things  have c hanged. The 20th Centur y, even though we were 
in a village, we were like looking for war d to the progr es s  of the world, if you will.
 
My father had a 
bus ines s .We also had far mland. So we produc ed our own food and s o on. In thos e days  we didn't 

have trac tors.We us ed hor s es  with plows . Like you s ee in pictur es.
 
 
Mos t of all, I r emember  living in a democ rac y. Even at m y age
 
--
 
by the way, when the war 
br oke out, I was  like 10 year s  old. So that all happened befor e 10.
I
n the m id 
`
30s, I was  ver y young. 
Like I s aid, I have older br others . My oldes t brother  was  14 years  older  than I was . So they wer e in 

between. There were others  in between.
 
 
In our fam ily 
--
 
it just s o happens  we'r e a little m ore progr es s ive c ompar ed to som e people. 
When I s ay progr es s ive
 
--
 
we lived in a village, we lived very s imple but we had our own food, plowed 
our s elves , br ought in the food, you know, and s o on.We got s ome help, ac tually, fr om the peas ant
s 
and s o on. But the point is  we wer e s elf
- su
ffic ient, if you will. And this  is  the way we wer e gr owing up.
 
 
My brothers
 
--
 
the r eas on a lot of people had big fam ilies  is  bec aus e they needed help. 
[Laughter ] So m y brothers  worked, es pec ially the older ones , wor ked ver y, very hard, c ons tantly. My 

fath
er was  like the master . Unlike in the United States , your  father  was  your father , you never  answered 
your  father. He s napped his  finger, you know, you just jum ped. So my older  brothers , they had the 
bur den. They really c arr ied the weight. But at a cer tain point they dec ided, hey, m y father does n't pay 
me
; 
I better go in the c ity and look for wor k . So they left, my two older br others .
 
And then my s is ter , s he 
was  like most gir ls in a village, wor e r egular house dr es s es  you m ade your s elf and s o on. She was  a 

l
ittle m ore s ophistic ated. She was
 
--
 
s he dec ided to go to c ollege away from home. So s he went to the 
c ity.
 

3 
 
 
Cons equently, the reas on
 
I m entioned all of this, not
 
to br ag, but I m entioned it for a reas on. It 
had 
a big effec t on me. Bec aus e I was  the youngest one. And I s ay that this  is  wher e life s hould be. 
Like you s hould get educated and s o on. And m y m other  was  pus hing stuff like that. So my s is ter went 
to s c hool. She was  away  fr om home. So when s he c ame hom e, I s aw her s tudy. And it had an effec t on 
m e.
 
 
At any rate, like I s ay, my older  br others wer e gone. So
 
the 
only two of them wer e able to 
work. I had another older brother. He was  very s trong and ver y c apable. And I was  his  helper . You 

have to r emem ber, I was  like 10, 11 year s, eventually 12, 13. My father was  in the m eat bus ines s . We 
had to s laughter  anim als and s o on. And then we had to work  in a field. And I was  his  helper . I would 
lead the hors es. He would hold the plow and s o on.
 
 
One thing we did, we r eally had fun doing it.We us ed to hors e around a lot. So we had a good 
r elations hip in our fam ily. Unlike s om e fam ilies  they have fights and all of this . I don't r emember  ever 

having argum ents or fights  am ong us . We jus t did whatever  we had to do.
 
 
Any way, s o this is  the star t of m y life. But m os t of all, bec aus e of m y s is ter
 
--
 
m y sister was m y 
exam ple, all of a s udden I felt like I r eally wanted to do that. So the future looked a little better for me. 
But then, of c our se, everything was  s hatter ed becaus e the war  cam e. And when Hitler
 
--
 
the first 
c
ountry he took  in Eur ope was  the Czec h part. And he wanted the Czec hs .Why?  Bec aus e the 

Czec hs , they wer e a small c ountry but they had very good, believe it or  not, tr ucks and c ars. They were 

known for  that. And believe it or not, they had very good tanks, like the lates t, like as  good as the 
Germ an. And no c ountry in Eur ope had that, only the Czec hs . So we were very pr oud.
 
 
When the war  c am e, by that tim e I was 10 year s  old. All of a sudden our whole life c hanged. 
Then we kept on hearing about all of the things that wer e happening in Germ any. The J ews  had to 
leave, wer e r unning away, wer en't able to and s o on. So we hear d all kinds  of nas ty, nas ty things  that 

were happening.
 
 
Now, you have to r em ember , befor e that, J ewis h in Ger m any, Czec h, Hungary
 
--
 
beli
eve it or 
not, Ger many had a democr acy. But a lot of people don't realize,
 
before that. They didn't bec aus e of 
the war, first of all, one, the Fir s t Wor ldWar.
 
Anyway, we felt like there was  a future. All of a s udden the 
Hungar ians c ame in, oc cupied our  area, and all of a s udden the future look ed dim .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  going to ask  you, when the Hungarians c ame in 1939 and oc c upied your  town 
and c ommunity, do you rem em ber  them  c oming in and oc c upying it?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Oh, yeah. I r em ember c learly as  day. I was 10 years  old. I r em ember
 
--
 
the funniest 
thing is  they had
 
--
 
just to give you a c om par is on, 13,000 troops  outs ide of town for weeks. They were 
tr ying to c om e fur ther  and they c ouldn't go.We had 300 Czec h s oldiers  s tationed in our town. And t
he 
300 s oldiers  kept back 13,000, 14,000 tr oops outs ide
 
--
 
you know, just one town away, ac tually. But 
ther e was  a river and they wer e able to hold them back.
 
 
I m us t als o c onfes s, the Czechs  were equipped with tanks but they wer e r eal tank s , like the 
Germ
an tanks. They were really up to date. They had s om e of the best ar ound. In fac t, the Germ an 
wanted the Czec h factories  right away bec aus e they had improved on the Germ an tank . So they 

wanted to have
 
--
 
with the fighting, the c annon or whatever , they im pr oved on it and they wanted thos e 
blueprints . So they wanted the Czec h par t imm ediately.
 
 
Any way, but the point I want to make is  this.When Hungary came in
 
--
 
by the way, the 
population wher e we lived wer e prim ar ily Rus s ian. I know Czec hos lovakia, Rus s ian, does n't m ake 

s ens e. But the way it was , ther e was  a Czec h part, Slovakia, whic h the language was  s lightly different 
than the Czec hs  but c ons idered them s elves
 
a s epar ate people. And then in our ar ea, the population 
was  Rus s ian s peaking. I don't m ean Rus s ia from  like deep Rus s ia but European Rus s ian.We got 
along. We went to s c hool together. We lived like you do here in the United States, you know, we didn't 
hav
e any pr oblem s .
 
 
What happened
 
--
 
the r eas on I mention that, who they wer e, they were Rus s ian, the 
Hungar ians and the Germ ans  had s uc h s uper ior ity; they jus t felt like Slavic  people wer e down on the 
bottom of the barr el. They were like nothing c om par ed to 
a Germ an or a Hungar ian. They wer e 

4 
 
s ophis tic ated. They wer e Hungarian, Ger m an. And they had this  pr ejudic e built in to their s ys tem 
throughout history.
 
 
So what happened, they didn't like them either  bec aus e they wer e oc c upied as  well. They 
didn't like it either . But what happened was  as  s oon as  the Hungar ians  c ame in, my father  was  old 
enough
 
--
 
he ac tually s erved in WorldWar I under the Aus tria Hungarian empire. He was , well, not s o 
bad, you c ould get along with them. It tur ned out he was  wrong bec aus e they joined the Nazis . So they 
bec ame just like them.
 
 
They c ame in. By the way, they c am e in
 
--
 
you have to laugh a little bit. Did not realize why the 
300 troops  were able to hold them back . They c ame on bic yc les .
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > MartinWeis s :  I k now, 
go to war  on bic yc les ! 
 
> > [Laughter] 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  They had s oldiers , s o m any of them , m arc hing thr ough town for a whole day and they 
had thr ee little tank s . And I tell you, I was  10 years  old s o I was  not big, believe me. And they wer e like 
toys, li
ke from Wor ldWar I, actually. They were WorldWar I m odel. And her e the Czec h tank s  were like 
tanks !  And I r emem ber as  a kid, we wer e laughing our heads  off. How can you go to war  like this ?  You 

know?  And this  is the way it was .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But, of cour s e, onc e they wer e ther e, things  c hanged dram atic ally.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Onc e they wer e ther e
 
--
 
the r eas on I mentioned they looked down at us, the 
Rus s ians  or the Slavic  people, bec aus e they felt they were infer ior. Very s im ple. They didn't hide it.
 
They didn't beat around the bus h. This  was  their polic y. Nobody likes  to be infer ior. Let's fac e it.
 
The Hungarian peasant or the poor  people were no different than the Russ ians  were or  we wer e. It's  
that s im ple. Poor people ar e the s ame, bas ic ally, whenever you go. 
 
 
Any way, they c ame in. And the fir st thing they s tarted doing, c am e out with anti
-
s emitic laws  
or  anti
-
J ewis h law. And what did that mean?  That you all of a s udden lost all of your c ivil r ights . Here 
we wer e us ed to living in a fr ee c ountr y, a democrac y. As  a kid, it was  ver y  hard to ac c ept. But anyway, 
that's  the way it was .
 
 
So the fir st thing they did, they took  away people's  bus ines s es. They wouldn't give them a 
lic ens e to have a bus ines s .They took  away the people he's  
livelihood
. If you were a teac her, you los t 
your  job. Whatever you did. You jus t c ouldn't work .
 
 
And everybody had fam ilies . And people were not r ich ther e believe me. Mos t people 
s tr uggled. So this  was  the way it s tarted. But what happened is  as tim e went on, they kept on g
etting 
m or e organized. They wer e c oming down with more and mor e edicts  all the tim e. Eventually they c am e 
out with the yellow s tar. We had to wear the yellow s tar .
 
And this  may s ound like not a big deal 
after wards  but at the time, it was  very demeaning, lik e you'r e s ingled out. And by the way, they had 

c urfews  on us, all kinds of r es tric tions .
 
To put it s im ply, they made life miserable. This went on and on.
 
 
In the m eantim e, while all of this  was  going on, we kept on hearing
 
--
 
bec aus e the Germans  
were very
 
s uc c es sful, went into Ukraine, took Poland. By the way, r ight after  that, within thr ee week s , 
they took  Poland. I have r emember that, too. Becaus e Poland was  next door  to us.
 
They started getting 
m or e and m or e
 
--
 
well, maybe they wer e that way to begin with bec aus e they had s ort of lik e a 
hierarc hy in Hungar ian cultur e.
 
 
By the way, they had it in the Polis h c ulture, too. Ther e were the poor. There was  the 
so-
c alled bourgeois if you will. And what happened is we were not us ed to that. Bec aus e to us, like i
n 
the United States, you could be a ric h man but I'm  not to bow to you. But in Hungary, they did. It 

s ounds  funny. Soc iety was  fixed that way.
 
 
The reas on I m ention it, becaus e ther e was  a s umm er  r es ort in town. A nic e one, too. By 
today's  standards. And the reas on I was  a little luc kier than s ome plac es is  I was  expos ed to that. So 

dur ing the s um m er  we us ed to get a lot of vis itors and they us ed to c ome to town to go to the s pa.
 
So I lear ned more about the outs ide wor ld. It was  a different wor ld outs ide. And s inc e we lived in a 

village, we wer e not expos ed to this. So we s aw m ore how c ity people liv ed and s o on. I thought it was  

5 
 
terr ific that they c ould do this .
 
But what happened is , I als o lear ned that they wer e very, very c las s  
c ons c ious . And, again, we w
er e not us ed to that. Even as  a kid I r efus ed to ac c ept that.
 
 
By the way, they c los ed our s c hools right away. I went to Czec h sc hools . They c los ed our 
s c hools . And just fr om my own pers onal point of view, the population, I mentioned, wer e Rus s ian so 
they 
had Rus s ian s chools  under the Czec hs . They wanted their own s c hools , s o the Czec hs  let them  
have their own s c hools . And gues s  what. We had to go to the Rus s ian s c hool.
 
 
Now, admittedly I k new how to s peak Rus s ian fr om  the time I was  a kid bec aus e everybody
 
in 
town was  Rus s ian. Ok?  So I had no pr oblem s peaking it. However , I didn't know the alphabet. I didn't 
know r ead
ing or  w
r iting or  anything like this. I went into fifth gr ade. I m ention this , a lot of young people 
es pecially, and ther e the s ys tem  was  different. Our s c hool was
 
--
 
s imilar to the United States . The 
teac hers wer e nic e
, l
ike or dinar y, nic e people. Over ther e the teac her s wer e very rigid. They believed in 
c or poral punis hm ent and that kind of s tuff.
 
 
They put us into the c las s , never even teaching us  the alphabet fir st. We got into the c las s and 
we had to c ar r y the s ame load as  the other kids even though they knew how to r ead and write alr eady. 
We didn't know how to. I was  able to s peak  it but c ouldn't r ead or write it. I didn't even know the 
alp
habet. So that was  our expos ur e to our problem s  fr om the s tart. But s omehow
 
--
 
you had to learn 
r ather  quickly.
 
So the next two, three year s I was  going to the s c hool and I learned how to read and 
wr ite in Rus s ian, and s o on. Now I c an't remem ber any of it
. 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So Mar ty, onc e you'r e under the Hungar ians and they im pos ed all of thes e new 
anti
-
S em itic
 
laws , mor e and m or e edic ts c ame out, people los t
 
--
 
the J ews  los t their livelihoods. How did 
your  fam ily s urvive in those c onditions ?
  
How did you get food?  And you lived in a r ur al area.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right. Well, we wer e ver y fortunate. Like I s aid in the beginning, we had our own land 

s o we grew a lot of our  own food. So we wer e r eally independent.We had everything thr oughout t
he 
war until we wer e taken away. Ac tually, we even had gr ain stored away already for the rainy days . We 

were thinking ahead. But we us ed to gr ow our food and we us ed to harves t it and so on.
 
 
And by the way, we used a lot of food bec aus e we had a big family. Not only that, but we had 
vis itors  all the time. Ok?  So we r eally us ed a lot of food but we wer e able to m anage fine.
 
My 
father
 
--
 
all the bus ines s  that we wer e doing, we had to do it during the night. Mind you, our neighbor s  
were regular neighbor s, good neighbor s . But gues s  what. They didn't like the Hungarians  any
 
more 
than we did bec aus e they were peas ant
s
, too, but not quite like we were but we c ould not trust them. 
Ever ything we did we had to do during the night.
 
 
By the way, here we hav e elec tric ity. We didn't have elec tr ic ity. We had to do it by c andle light. 
So we us ed to hold two candles . Like I say, I was  a youngs ter . My brother did all the work in the dark . 
Ok?  And we had to do all of this. And by m or ning everything had to be gone bec aus e the
 
polic e would 
c om e or  the detectives  would c ome and s noop. And r ight away would go to pr is on just like that.
 
 
So ever ything, all of this , we did this  thr oughout the war. But what bother ed me all the time is  
that our neighbors, even though they got along and everything, but we c ouldn't tr us t them enough. We 
would figur e just enough to think  they would get some kind of paym ent or s om ething.
 
 
And that's s ad, when you think of your neighbors like this. I always  felt bad about that. And the 
r eas on I felt bad is  
bec aus e had the tables been turned the other  way, on the other s ide, I know our  
family would have done anything to help. So r ight or wrong, I judged them wr ongly I think  bec aus e I 

went by m y s tandar ds. But anyway, that's how I reac ted. I rem em ber we felt that way that we had to be 
very c ar eful. Nobody s hould report us. So this is  the way we lived.
 
 
However, what happened r ight after that, m y two older  brothers

ac tually, r ight in the 
beginning, the fir st year, they induc ted all the J ewis h m en m ilitar y age, fr om  about 20 to 45 I think it 

was , ever y s ingle pers on
;  
didn't matter if you had a fam ily or  s omebody was  s ick in your fam ily, they 
induc ted them into the se
r vic e. Not to the Army but they were tr eated like they wer e in the Arm y. That 

m eans  they wer e under the Army juris dic tion. And they wore c ivilian c lothes  but gues s what they used 
them for. They us ed them  for like s lave labor , ac tually.
 

6 
 
 
That par t of Eur ope, fr om our ar ea all the way to Rus s ia, a lot of m ountains , forests, for ests 
and m ountains . That's  all you have. Poland is  full of it. Ukraine is  huge. It's a big ar ea. They us ed them 
to c ut down all the tr ees  in the fores ts . I'm not talking about elec tric  buzz s aws . I'm  talking about the old 
s aws , that kind of work. They us ed them for c utting down. Why?  Bec ause they didn't want the 
par tisans
 
--
 
hiding places for  the par tis ans. So that's why they had them do this . This  was  one of the 
jobs .
 
 
Some of them, inc luding m y brother s, were s ent up to the Rus s ian fr ont. And the Rus s ian 
fr ont
 
--
 
one of my br others , es pec ially, he was  like the fir st one there. He was  ther e
 
--
 
it's  1940. He was  
in plac es  they had to bury the dead, m inefields , that's what they us ed them 
for .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To c lear minefields .
 
> > MartinWeis s :  That's what I m eant. Yeah. It jus t s o happens, to give you the whole thing about this  
br other, he was  there for a long, long tim e. Finally  he got over  to the Rus s ian s ide. Now, us ually
 
--
 
ther e 
w
er e a lot of people like him from our ar ea, Czec h c itizens . When you got to Rus s ia, they volunteer ed 
into the Czec hos lovakia legion. They had a legion s et up. They wer e happy to have them  bec aus e they 
put on uniform s, fighting the Germans.
 
But my brother, 
when he got over  to the Rus s ian s ide, guess  
what. Som ehow they pic ked him.Why, I don't k now. They ac c us ed him  of being a Rus s ian s py
 
--
 
I 
m ean a Germ an s py. Ok ?  And gues s  what. They put him in pris on with the Ger man pr isoner s  of war . 
In the c oal m ines in
 
the mountains. And he was  there for the rest of the tim e. The Rus s ians kept the 
Germ an pris oners of war  two years  extr a after the war. 
 
 
Finally he was  r eleas ed in 1947. We already gave up, figured he died. He didn't s how up. He 
jus t didn't exis t. Nobody knew anything about where he was .
 
So jus t when
 
--
 `
47, after they r eleased 
him , s omehow or other
 
--
 
I'll tell you the details  bec aus e it's  too c omplicated but he got to our  
hom etown finally and he dis c over ed m ost people didn't stay there. They wer e gone. But ther e wer e a 

few people, J ewis h people, that settled in the sm all c ity not far  away, about 10
 
kilometers away. He 
went s tr aight there. He m ade s ure nobody knew he was  there bec aus e in thos e days  they had polic e, 

the s lightest thing they would pic k  you up and throw away the key. That's  jus t the way the Rus sians 
were. 
 
 
Any way, he eventually
 
--
 
by that time
 
--
 
oh, yeah. One man moved ther e. My older brother 
was  s till in Czec h Republic . This  amazes  m e. Ther e was  no phone, no c omm unic ation, nobody knew 

wher e
 
anybody was . Som ehow he had the addr es s  and got in touc h with him. And again, I'll s ave tim e, 
he es c aped from ther e to Slovakia and my br other s ent him papers and c lothes  bec aus e he didn't have 

any c lothes . And a s ister
-
in
-
law, s he was  s ingle. On the Rus sian r ule, under  Comm unism, if you wanted 
to travel from here to New Yor k, you have to have while you're
 
--
 
why you're tr aveling, a perm it. And he 
didn't have any of that. So c ons equently my br other  s ent him  all of that s tuff and he was  able to com e 

A ll the
 
way to where he was .
 
Eventually, he got out from  ther e he went to, believe it or not, Isr ael. And 
fr om  Is r ael he c ame out to the United States.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, you and your fam ily r em ained in the c ir c um stanc es you wer e des c r ibing, 
r em ained in Hungary until 1944, for several years .
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us what happened then.What c hanged
 
--
 
even as horr ible as  things  were, they 
r eally c hanged profoundly wors e in 1944 for you and your  family.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Oh, yeah.Well, actually, it c hanged wor s e. But bas ically it was n't. By then we knew 

the wr iting on the wall that they wer e going to pick  us  up any day. There were r um ors .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Deportations .
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Depor tations . And by the way, before we went
 
--
 w
e were lucky we wer e left that late. 
But in Poland and Ukr aine, they had mas s  killings.We heard about this  bec aus e we lived not far fr om  
ther e.
 
 
By the way, thr ough the grapevine. Ther e was  no news paper s  or r adio. We just heard it. 
Explic it s tor ies.We heard all kinds  of stories  of what was  happening in Poland and what was  happening 
in the Uk raine and the mas s  killings  whic h tur ned out to be the Eins atzgr uppen or killing squads. They 

would take ar eas, people wer e 300, 20,000, take them to a field and kill them. In s om e plac es they had 

7 
 
like 20,000, 30,000 at one time. And like in two days  they would kill
 
--
 
ther e was  one on exhibition, 
32,000 in two days .
 
 
I m et a kid that esc aped from  a plac e there wer e 41,000 people killed like this . Can you 
imagine?  Lik
e 
a s laughter hous e c ouldn't be that
 
bad. Mas s  graves  in the Ukr aine, a lot of mas s 
graves .
 
There's a Catholic  pr iest who took  it upon him s elf to look  into this . He dis c over ed over  1,000 
m as s graves . Ok?  But we hear d all of that s o c ons equently we pr epar ed for the wor s t but ther e was  
nothing you c ould do.
 
 
We wer e thinking of going to the fores t and hide but we are a big fam ily, I had younger s is ter s  
and m y mother  and s o on. How do you leave them behind? So eventually  we dec ide
d 
not to go 
bec aus e my father, 
my br other , we were going to go a few of us but what is  going to happen to them ?  

So we jus t waited. We alr eady knew it was  c om ing time to pick us  up.
 
 
At firs t, the Hungar ians , by the way, turned down the German offer to take us . But then, in 
`
44, 
they 
dec ided they wer e going to go
 
--
 
they asked them  again. They s aid, oh, s ure, tak e them. In two 
m onths
 
--
 
and this I emphas ize
 
--
 
in two months they em ptied out almos t 450,000 people fr om Hungar y 
and s hipped us out to Aus c hwitz. Ok?  Firs t we went to a ghetto, which was  a s hor t dur ation. But the 

point is  we went to Auschwitz.
 
 
Now, we c ame to Ausc hwitz. In our c as e, by the way, we wer e 125 people in one boxc ar. Ok?  
125 people. And one boxc ar . And you'r e talking about m os t of us had big families , like I s ay.
 
You could 
have had a s on 25, 30 year s  old but a 5
-
year
-
old kid in the fam ily. There were a lot of kids under 10.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Wer e you in there with your whole fam ily?
 
> > MartinWeis s : With m y whole fam ily, r ight. So we were taken to a ghetto fir st. We wer e put on thos e 
boxc ars . The Hungar ians  were s o eager , s o c ooper ative
 
--
 
by the way, they
 
--
 
thos e tracks  that were 
going to Aus chwitz, they had to take material to the tr oops  bec ause the Hungar ian tr oops  were fighting 
on the front with the Germ ans , alongs ide the Germ ans . They oc c upied thos e tracks with us  train after 
tr ain. They had like s ever al tr ains  a day. And each tr ain had 100, 120 boxc ars . Think of that. 125, 135 
them in a boxc ar. Do the m ath. I never  try to.
 
 
What do 
you 
c all it? We c am e
 
--
 
in
 
our  c as e, we c ame to Mauthaus en. The Hungarians  did it 
all in two m onths. Mind y ou the logistic s  of it jus t to do that.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you were in the boxc ar  with your family, did you k now wher e you wer e going?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  No.We knew we wer e
 
going to bad plac es. Bec aus e by now we heard all the stor ies  
you c ould poss ibly dream  up. So we were pr epar ed for the wor s t. But nobody ever expec ted like what 
happened in Aus c hwitz. Ok?  You just c ouldn't be a nor mal human being and think that.
 
> > Bill B
ens on:  Even though you felt prepar ed for the wor s t.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yeah. We heard of the m as s acr es , of the m as s  killings, of all of that by now. Ok?  We 

hear d of all of that. Not only that, but I'll tell you, even the Hungarians who wer e prac tic ing the
 
s ame 
thing, while they wer e s tationed there on the Russ ian front, gues s what they wer e doing. Throwing 

women and c hildr en into the river on a daily bas is . It wasn't just the Germ ans .
 
 
And by the way, in Budapes t, they did exac tly the s ame thing. Even befor e we left
 
--
 
were 
deported, we already heard stor ies in Budapes t. They wer e thr owing women and c hildr en into the 

Danube River, daily bodies  floating in the r iver . So it just gives  you an example.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about ar riving in Aus c hwitz if you
 
c an.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Ok .When we c ame to Poland, we already got a wake
-
up c all. We knew we were 
going som eplac e eas t but we didn't know where. We rec ognized the nam es  on the
 
--
 
you know, but the 
m eantime we were in the boxc ar s , no food, no water, no nothing. The only thing we had was  a buck et 
in the c or ner. That's  it. 
 
 
And, again, everybody had big fam ilies
, a
 
lot of children. A lot of old people.We c am e to 
Aus c hwitz. As  s oon as
 
--
 
we c am e to reunite. So 
--
 
we c am e in the night. So it must have been about 
m idnight. As  s oon as they opened the door s, they star ted s houting or der s , 
ﬁ
Sc hnell!,
ﬂ 
get out fas t. And 
ther e wer e people with unifor m s. We didn't know who they were. And s tick s  like broomstic k s , 

threatenin
g to hit you. Then we found out they wer e c alled kapos. They wer e jus t other pris oners. They 

8 
 
were doing their  job, but they had to do what they had to do. Som e of them wer e probably mean but 
m os t of them just put on an ac t. They had to be like that. But we
 
c an't know that. To us it s eem ed real.
 
 
Bec aus e it was  nighttime, they had the perim eter , on the gr ound, s urr ounded with flood lights . 
But no s ooner we wer e there, I'm talking about thous ands  of people fr om this  train, a lot of people. A 
big c irc le, big a
rea. 
 
 
By the way, all the s ec tions  in Aus c hwitz, eac h s ec tion with bar bed wir e and they were 
elec tr ified. So where they expec t us  r un or how to r un, we have our whole families , we're all c ivilians , 

but they had guards  with the tr igger  liter ally on their finger s urr ounding us ever y five, s ix feet, the 
per im eter . And then they had dogs, that, believe m e, es pec ially where we are c am e fr om , we
 
were not 
us ed to that, r eally nas ty, gr owling dog. If you let him loos e, believe m e, he would rip you apart like that.
 

And this  is when we c am e to Aus c hwitz.
 
 
As  s oon as you got on the gr ound, they s epar ated imm ediately m en fr om the wom en. Then 
we had to go to a line. An offic er would s tand ther e like from  a Holly wood movie, s hiny boots , fancy 

br idges, c lean, nic e, ver y sharp. You would pas s . They would jus t go this  way or  that way.
 
 
Now, we heard rum or s . Nobody told us  r eally. Bec aus e of our neighbor, people would be able 
to work and they will tak e c ar e of our fam ilies . They wouldn't tr eat them well but they will be livin
g. Ok? 
 
So this  is the r um or. This is  what we ac c epted.What els e ar e you going to do?
 
Well, as s oon as  we 
c am e there, they went thr ough the line and they were pic king.
 
 
By the way, one of the reas ons  I'm her e today, I think, and the only explanation I hav
e, I put 
on two, three jack ets befor e I got off the tr ain s o
 
I looked bigger . I rem em ber  
dis tinctly m aking that 
dec is ion. Ok ?  And why?  Becaus e we knew they will want you to work .We had if it figured out if we 

work, they will take c ar e of our  families  be
c aus e of that.
 
Of c ours e, that was  a falac y. But the point is  
this  is  what we believed in our own heads .
 
I went thr ough. I'll tell you why I think the jacket s aved me. 
Bec aus e all my friends , I was  the only one bor n of m y year  that c am e back . Now, m any ofthem  were 

m y s ize, s om e of them bigger  but I was  the only one bor n in it m y year that c am e back .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, who els e fr om  your  family was  s elec ted for work?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Ok . As s oon as we c am e ther e
 
--
 
fir st of all, m y m other, jus t
 
--
 
m y 
m other  and two 
younger  s isters went to the gas  c ham ber  imm ediately
, a
ll the other people.
 
 
Now, jus t to give you an example how unpredic table everything was . I had an aunt. She didn't 
have any c hildren. She wanted to help m y m other . So s he went with
 
--
 
she
 
was  a young woman. She 
c ould have eas ily lived but s he went with them. Of c ours e nobody expec ted that.
 
 
Any way, but m y br other
 
--
 
m y father and m y brother  went through the line and we pas s ed. 
Ok?  Now, as  we pas s ed, we went
 
--
 
we wer e like in one ar ea. I notic ed not far away, ac tually, there 
was  a lengthy s pac e. Ther e was  a bunc h of wom en with the c hildr en like a little dis tanc e, like from here 

to that wall, very short dis tanc e, em pty s pac e. I notic ed my mother over there. So I s aid to my father, 
you know s omething, I'll make a das h ac r oss  that s pac e and join them becaus e I'll be able to get s om e 
food or  s omething. I knew m y s is ters  were too young. They were 8 and 10 or s omething like that. So I 
tr ied to make a das h acros s  this partic ular  s pac e. And one of thos e guys  with the s triped unifor m with a 

s tick grabbed a hold of m e, back  of my neck , threw m e back and s ays , "You c an't go ther e!"  And 
threatened me. I found out he was  a pr is oner. Said to m y father, 
c ould you 
imagine another pr is oner, 
he's  so mean?  W
ell, gues s  what. He just s aved m y life. I didn't k now this  until the following m or ning. It 
jus t shows  you how life is . You never know what s aves  you. This is  jus t a c oinc idenc e. But I'll always  
r em em ber that.
 
 
They went thr ough s hower s . Like I s ay, all the other  people went to the gas  c hamber s 
imm ediately. But more than that we went thr ough the s howers . They took  away all of our  c lothes, 

ever ything els e. They gave us  s tr iped c lothes.
 
And by the way, this  was  in Poland. Spring but c old and 
dingy and raw. Ic an't explain it.We wer e s hiver ing.
 
 
We c ame out of the s hower, by that time it was  dawn. They m arc hed us  up to a barr ack . We 
c am e to the bar rack, and they wouldn't let us  in. We had to s tand outs ide, no matter how it was, ho
w 
nas ty it was .
 
While we were
 
standing there, we saw this  huge fire under  pine tr ees. Ther e was  a r ow of 
pine trees and it was  a huge fir e, like the length of a football field. The flam es  wer e going high up to the 

9 
 
pine trees, high up through the tr ees . In the meantim e, we s aw the c rematoriums  s urrounding the ar ea 
with the tall c him neys . We s aw this  black s m oke. And it was  s o m is er able. The weather  was  like made 
for the day. It was  like if ther e's s uc h a thing as hell, you c ouldn't have painted it any different. It was  
dingy. Not exac tly r aining but dr izzle, c old, and this  blood s oot c om ing down like s now. And this was  
our  firs t m or
ning in Auschwitz. 
 
 
So we 
--
 
oh, then we found out one of the kapos  explained what the c himneys  wer e, that they 
were c rematoriums . Before that, we never hear
d of cr em ator ium s . We didn't c ome fr om that kind of 
world. We asked what the fir e was . He s ays  "Thos e are your  families ." J ust lik e this . The people who 
were c om ing
 
--
 
the tr anspor t was  s o heavy, s o c ons tant, the c rematoriums c ould not handle the 
volum e. So they us ed a ditc h and they bur ned them in the ditc h. And that was  our  wake
-
up to 
Aus c hwitz.
 
And let m e tell you s om ething. I r emember dis tinc tly
 
--
 
I r em ember I didn't have any tear s . 
You wer e just like
 
--
 
it's real but it's not. You know?  I c an't explain it. You were jus t like you'r e s tunned. 
It's  har d to explain.
 
 
We wer e ther e a very s hort time. By the way, we had bunks , 10 them  in a bunk . 
--
 
people in a 
bunk . This was  our firs t day in Aus c hwitz. And after  that, of c ours e, we found out this happened a
nd 

that happened. Then we were pr epar ed for anything.
 
 
Now
,  
bec aus e we heard of all the m as s  killings pr ior, about the m as s  killings  at all, we figur ed, 
hey, s ooner  or  later they'r e going to do it to us . Why would they s ave us ?
 
Any way, we got put on a tr ai
n 
that took  us Aus tria.We c am e to Austr ia. The only r eas on we were in Aus tr ia, bec aus e we c am e and 
the tr ain stopped on the Danube. We s aw Vienna not far  off.We could r ecognize it was  Vienna s o we 
knew wher e we wer e. But it kept on going and c ame final to des tination. The thing stopped alongs ide 
this  huge mountain.We dis em barked. They m ar ched us  up the m ountain
. W
e c ome up to the top of the 
m ountain and ther e was  a big s ign, Mauthaus en. So that's where we knew we were in a plac e c alled 
Mauthausen.
 
 
Now, 
Mauthaus en was  built on a s tone quarr y. So the pr is oners  that wer e stationed in 
Mauthausen wer e 
dying
 
ther e on a daily bas is  just fr om  har d labor. It was  s o, s o hard and s o 
grues om e. They had to cut out the rocks. Not with a m ac hine or  with elec tric  s aws  or whatever  you do 

c utting out r ock . They had picks  and s hovels . And m ost of all, ever ybody was  s tarving all the tim e.
 

 
By the way, they c ouldn't even get a drink  of water . It was  hot on top of the mountain when 
they brought the stone up
 a
nd s o on. So we kept on hearing stories about that. It was  just br utal.
 
 
Now, mos t of Mauthaus en, by the way, mos t of the people wer e cons ider ed politic al 
pr is oner s
.A
nd by the way, they had people from  all over the wor ld. I mean, all over Eur ope, I s hould 
s ay. They had Germans  even. Som e wer e political. Many of the Germ ans were for different crim es, lik e 

r ape, r obber y, m ur der, em bezzlem ent, whatever, Jehovah's  Witness  , s ome of them  wer e. Thous ands  
of Czec hs  died in Mauthaus en.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you went to Mauthaus en,
 
you wer e with your father  at that time. Right?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Any other  family m ember s with y ou?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  No. My br other was  imm ediately
 
--
 
got s eparated in Ausc hwitz as  s oon as we got 
ther e. So my br other was  on his own
. 

 
By the way, he was s trong, big. I would have bet m y life he would r etur n. I returned. He didn't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you went to Mauthaus en with your  father.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om Mauthaus en you would be s ent on to a c am p c alled 
Melk.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yeah. Right. Fr om Mauthaus en
 
--
 
I stayed in Mauthaus en. That was  like the main 
c am p. But Mauthaus en had a lot of s ub
-
c am ps . I was sent to a c amp c alled Melk. It was  a s mall town. 
Not far  fr om there. We wer e building s tones under  the
 
huge m ountains . In les s  than a year  we built 
s even huge tunnels  under this  big huge m ountain.
 
The reas on they were s o anxious  to have thos e 
tunnels , bec aus e they were being bombed by the allies  and they wanted to 
put the factories 

under
gr ound. So they drove us  thr ee s hifts, c onstantly.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You'r e about 15 year s  old.
 

10
 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yeah. When I s ay har d labor, we had to even tak e the cement, not mixers
 
--
 
we're 
talking about big, big c aver ns , big s pac e.We had to take the s tuff, c ar ry the c ement bags  on our bac k  
fr om  plac e to plac e, underground, take the c ement, mix it with water and gravel, whatever , and put in 
pail and hand it up to differ ent levels . Im agine doing that work while you're s tar ving all the time. This  is 
what happened. So people were dying left and right, not bec aus e someone was  killing you, just plain 
you gave up. It does n't matter  how s tr ong you ar e. Sooner  or  later s omething happened to yo
u.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And by now you're in ear ly 1945. The Russians ar e advanc ing. The Germ ans are 
los ing the war . And s o they take you again at that time and take you to Guns kirc hen.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right. Exac tly. Now, first they took  us  back to Mauthausen bec aus e the Rus s ians  

were c los ing in.
 
 
And by the way, the Hungar ians  wer e als o retr eating bec aus e they were afraid to be c aptured 
by the Rus s ians . Everybody was  afr aid of the Rus s ians . So they kept on retr eating.
 

 
What happened, the Hungar ians , like I s ay, were retr eating. And gues s what. All the labor 
battalions  I m ention
ed to
 
you that wer e hungr y, they didn't leave behind
 
--
 
m ind you, the war is  over. 
Let them loos e, r ight?  They br ought them  in and they ended up in Gunskirc hen wher e I was . Ok ?  
Thous
ands of them. Mind you, they los t the war. You would think the s oldiers  would be happy to get rid 
of them and just go home. They didn't do that. They c am e into Aus tria. I could never under stand the 

logic , the s tupidity, whatever you want to call it.
 
 
Like 
I s ay, for  s ake of time, at c er tain tim es , c ertain point, they dec ided they better evac uate 
us  back  to Mauthaus en. So we went bac k  from the working c amp to Mauthaus en. As s oon as  you 

c am e to Mauthaus en, gues s  what. In this  c amp, throughout the war , through
out our working time, there 
were Greeks, Italians

by the way, the Gr eeks and Italians  may have been J ewis h but I have no way 
of knowing bec ause we c ouldn't c omm unicate. But there were people fr om Poland from  Russ ia, m y 
God, even Russ ian POWs whic h they were not s uppos ed to be ther e. But they had everybody in ther e.
 
 
As  s oon as we c am e back  to Mauthaus en at this time, firs t thing they did, they s eparated the 
J ewis
h population from the others . A
-
ha, now they're going to kill us . Why would they s eparate us ?
  
Till 
now we were all tr eated the s am e, worked the s am e, died the sam e, no differ enc e, no distinc tion. 
 
Why would they s epar ate us ?  That's exac tly what they did
. 
So we for  s ure
 
--
 
oh, and they took us out 
of the m ain c am p, put us on the s ide of the c am p.
 
Ok?  It was  a very neglec ted ar ea, like with thor n 
bus hes . Ther e was  har dly anyplac e to lay down. Oh, the s pr ing but it was  c old. We didn't have
 
--
 
we 
had one m eas ly blanket and the s tr iped uniforms  whic h was  nothing.
 
 
In the m eantim e, by this  time, forge
t food. Whatever  we c om plained about befor e, now we 
would have been happy to have that
, n
othing. In fac t, I'll tell you, things  were s o bad that
 
--
 
they had 
br ead. When they tried to c ut off a c hunk , the whole br ead would just crumble. By the way, found ou
t 
lat
er  it 
was  m ade out of sawdus t. It liter ally c rumbled. It was  like literally bread c rumbs like you buy in a 
groc ery store. So we had to put out the palm of our  hand. The guy would take a ladle and put it in your  

hand.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The bread. Yeah.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  And then you would get like a cup, a br oth if you want to c all it that, fr om a 

s ugar
 
--
 
they us e it for the c attle. They us ed to make a s ugar  beet br oth from  it. You didn't get the beets  
but you got the broth. That was  it. And by now we wer e sure they'r e going to kill us , that's  why they 

br ought us  her e. Why s epar ate us ?
 
 
Gues s what. One day they c ome out, we are going on a marc h. Again, r umors. One thing in 
plac es  like this , there's  always  
rumors
. They'r e going to take us to the Swiss  border  and trade us  for 
tr uck s . Am er ic ans  will give them trucks .
 
 
Now, mind you, I was already a s eas oned pr is oner.
 
One thing I was , I was  not daydr eaming. I 
s aid, yeah?  Som ebody's going to give truck s  for us ? We wer e like half dead anyway. Believe it or no
t, 
we wer e in s uc h bad s hape that I c an't im agine anybody tr ying to save any body.
 
 
So any way, we went on this  m arc h. The m arc h was  ver y s im ple. You m arc hed fr om ther e to a 
plac e c alled Gunskirc hen. Of c ours e, we had no idea wher e we were going.Wher ever  they told us to 

11
 
 
go, they had guards . Everybody was  jus t in bad shape. If s omebody fell down, they would tr ip, the 
guar d would s hoot them  on the s pot. J us t like that. Then a truck  would com e and pick them up.
 
 
I'll give you one little jus t idea. Ther e was  a potato on the gr ound. We were on a c ountry road. 
And this  one fellow s aw the potato. And he took  a leap for  it. Another fellow s aw the s am e potato. He 
jum ped for  it as well. Gues s  what. The two fellows  s tarted fighting over  the potato. Well gues s what. 
The 
guar d picked up his  rifle. The guar d was  like
 
--
 
I was  on the outs ide lane s o he was  like a c ouple of 
feet away from  m e. He pic ks up his  r ifle and s hoots  the m an r ight in the face, jus t like that. Bec aus e 
they wer e fighting over  the potato. It's ver y m emorable. And the reas on I c ould never ac c ept it, how 
c ould another human being do this ?  And by the way, they were not SS. They wer e r egular Arm y. They 
were s uppos ed to be the good guys . Hello?  I'd lik e to s ee the bad guys . So go ahead.
 
 
And this  is the exper ienc e you had. So c ons equent, what do
 
you
 
c all it
 
--
 
so when we c ame to 
Gunskirc hen, you found out things
 
--
 
as  bad as  we thought we were, this was  alr eady like the end of the 
line, if you will. People were liter ally walking around like zom bies .
 
 
Now, a lot of the Hungarian labor battalions  ended up there, m any, thous ands
 
--
 
I don't know 
exac tly the numbers  but there were lots  of them there.
 
But gues s  what m y luck. Again, lucky. I r an into 
a cous in of m ine. He was  in this Hungarian labor battalion. He was  
marched from Budapes t, fr om there. 

He end up. As s oon as I got ther e, immediately I ran into him
 o
ut of 14,000, 15,000 people. You tell me 
how that happens.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, in the little time we have rem aining, tell us  about liberation, your  libera
tion.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Ok . Yeah. So that was  a big plus  for  m e bec aus e they were in pr etty good s hape 
c om pared to us. J us t ps yc hologic ally I was  uplifted. Here were thes e guys , like they were like 22. They 
were in good s hape yet. They had good boots , good
 
c lothes, like their  own c lothes.
 
I'll never  forget that.
 
 
Any way, we found out one day
 
--
 
ther e was  s o muc h fr om ther e that I could tell you that it's 
alm os t humanly im pos s ible unders tand but people were just falling down, like literally falling down and 

c ouldn't get up.
 
 
Any way, the Americ ans
 
--
 
we hear d the Am er ic ans  were ther e but we didn't s ee any 
Am er ic ans . But som ebody notic ed the guar ds wer e gone. So that s hould have given us  enough 
c onfidenc e that we were ok . Right?  But guess  what. We dec ided to stay an extr a night. This  was  in the 

after noon. We spent an extra night in the c am p. We wer e afr aid to walk out. We wer e afr aid we'll walk 
out, they'll have mac hine guns  on the s ides  and m ow us  down.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like it was  a big trick .
 
> > Martin Weis s
:  Right. We wer e really afr aid. So we dec ided to s pend an extra night there, star ving 
and all. We didn't want to leave the plac e
 u
ntil we wer e s ure it was  ok .
 
So the next day we went out of 
the c amp. It's  ver y har d how you psyc hologic ally feel at the time
 
but at that tim e it m ade all the s ens e in 
the world.
 
So we walked out, s tar ted looking for food. I'll s pare you a lot of stuff in between but anyway, 
we c am e to this field and we s aw this  Arm y truck  in a ditc h. We inves tigated.We s aw this big tub of lar d
 

on the front seat. Like I said, thos e guys  were in fairly good s hape yet. They were young men. He jus t 
took
 
--
 
s omething with food s o we wanted it. But it was  loc ked. He took  his  fist, jus t went r ight thr ough 
the glas s, br oke the glass , all fell into the 
lar d. Ok ?  It s ounds s tupid, c ould have gone on the other s ide. 
But, you know, in tim es like this you don't think . You just do things. So anyway, fell into the lar d. But we 

took the lard and we s till wanted to s ave the lar d bec aus e we figured it has  s ometh
ing to do with food, 
s ave it. So we s c ooped it out, c leaned out the glas s  but s aved the lar d.
 
 
We started walking away . Before we walked away , we dec ided, hey, look  in the back  of the 
tr uck .What's there?  Well, we c lim b on the back  of the truck  and we fou
nd leather 
hides
 
all 
r eady for  
us e.We got r eally exc ited. I mean we knew we needed s hoes and we knew there wouldn't be any 
s hoes  for  love of m oney even if you had the m oney. But the point is , we c ould go to a s
hoem aker  and 
have us  m ade s hoes. Becaus e in E
ur o
pe, the s hoem akers still knew how to make s hoes fr om s cratc h. 
When I was  growing up, we had boots  for the winter. We had to have the Shoemaker.
 
 
At any rate, we went and took  this lard. And took  the leather hides , r olled up whatever you 
c ould c arr y. We
 
went up to this  farm hous e. It was  not far away. We mar c hed up to the farm hous e.
 
One 

12
 
 
thing I'll tell you. I had s uc h hatred for Germans . If s omebody s aid here's  a pis tol, s hoot him, he's 
Germ an, I rem em ber feeling s uc h hatr ed I felt I c ould have done it. O
k ? 
 
 
By the way, when I started s peaking, it took  four, five years that I rem em bered this  partic ular 
inc ident. That's why now I lik e to c lose with it.
 
 
We went to this  farmhous e. Mind you
 
--
 
I r em ember they were not as bad bec aus e they s pent 
more time in H
ungar y but I went through the whole deal, from  Ausc hwitz and s o on. So m y feelings 
were a lot, lot raw, just angry.
 
We got to the house. And this  is s omething that bother s  m e when I 
s tarted speaking about this , till this day it bother s m e
. H
ow c om e you behave like ordinary people?  We 
c am e to the hous e. We knoc ked on the door.We didn't barge in.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  This was  a German hous e?
 
>>
 
MartinWeis s :  A German hous ehold. The woman was  hom e alone. Lady c am e to the door. She 
opened the door. I r em ember bec aus e they were all tall and I was  s hort. I was  in the back . All I c ould 
s ee was  her fac e bec ause s he was  high up. And they as ked her very nic ely c an s he give us  s om e flour , 
s om e water, and som e eggs. The wom an tur ned ar ound, entered the kitc hen, br ought it out. 
 
 
Now
,  
why wouldn't we jus t go into the kitc hen and take over  the kitc hen?  Give me a break . 
Even if s he was  not helples s . Thes e guys  were in fairly good s hape. We c ould have done anything we 
wanted. But we didn't do that. Ins tead of going to the kitc hen and c ook  a meal, our firs t m eal
 
--
 
by the 
way, we were hungry!  Ther e was  a barn in the bac kyar d. In front of the bar n ther e was  th
is  ir on k ettle 
to heat up water  for the cows  and s tuff. I don't know if you ever  s aw it in a m ovie, like from the Midwes t. 
One of the guys  blended all the s tuff together, the eggs  and stuff, and made dumplings  bec aus e it was  
the eas iest thing to make.We boiled s om e water in this  rusty, ir on k ettle, in the barn.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Not in her  house.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Not in her  hous e. Never even suggested we go ther e. Nobody ever s aid we s hould 
go ther e. And we had our  fir s t meal. Ok? It's a funny thing. Even though I was  very young and I was  
very s tar ved but I ate a cer tain amount and I s topped. The r eas on I mention it, one of the fellows  
hooked up with an unc le of his . He was  older, li
ke ar ound 50
-
is h. That was  c ons idered
 
very old to s till 
be alive, let's  put
 
it this  way. He ate too muc h a day or two later he died. Then we found out thous ands  
of people died bec aus e of that. Bec aus e the Americ ans  gave them food too quickly and they c ouldn't 

tolerate it and they died. They died bec aus e of it. It took  them a while for  allies  to figur e out what was  
wr ong.
 
 
So her e's  the deal. We ate the food. I r emem ber, oh my God, r eally c ontent. One of the guys  
s uggests, you know, we s hould take s om e of the hides , eac h one of us, c ontribute to give to the lady.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you gave her hides  in return for the food s he had given you.
 
> > MartinWeis s : What always  bothered me, why we did that. Not one of us  objec ted. I was  the one 

that r eally
 
--
 
I s hould have objected. I didn't. We jus t did exac tly as  s ugges ted
, w
ent to the 
door
, n
ever  
went to her hous e
, g
ave her the hides  and s aid thank  you and walked away fr om ther e.
 
 
You know, like I s ay, I s poke for  four, five year s  before this  s tory s ort of hit me. I have to 
adm it, ever y time I s peak , I always  like to inc lude it. It always  bother ed me that we wer e s o c ivil. 
Bec aus e, believe m e, I didn't feel c ivil. I didn't feel human. I r em ember dis tinc tly we did not feel human 
yet we ac ted like human beings . And this  is s om ething, with hinds ight, I c ould never  quite figure it out. 
But b
ec ause we were rais ed a c ertain way, s om ehow we all had it. Ok?  Not one of us  objected.
 
 
I better  stop her e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e going to stop now. It's our tr adition at
 
Fir s t Per s on
 
that our Fir st Per s on has  the 
las t wor d s o I'm going to turn back to 
Marty in jus t a m om ent to c los e our  progr am.
 
A c ouple of things 
before I do that. One is to tell you that he will be s igning c opies of "Ec hoes  of Mem or y" when he's  

finis hed. So when he's  done, he will go up
 
--
 
if you allow him to head up the s ide s o he c an
 
go up there 
and s ign c opies  of "Ec hoes  of Mem or y
.
" 
W
e obvious ly didn't have a c hance for  you to ask  questions . 
You c an s ee we c ould have s pent m any m or e hour s . Unfortunately we only jus t touc hed on many, 
m any things  that Marty c ould have s hared with us
, n
ot only in what 
h
e went through dur ing the 
Holoc aus t but r ight after liber ation and what happened to him  fr om there.
 
 
J us t one thing, Marty. Your  father  was  at Mauthaus en but he did not s ur viv e.
 

13
 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  No. He died s uppos edly of pneum onia. Again,
 
m y father was  in the s ame c am p I 
was , in Melk, ac tually, that's wher e he died. But we har dly saw eac h other . Onc e in a while. Bec aus e 
he worked s hifts . I worked s hifts . We were on different s ides  of cam p. Sometim es  by c hanc e we were 
able to m eet, just a few times  now that I think of it. And one day c ame back  and I had an unc le with 
him , too, and he inform ed m e that he died. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to turn to Mar ty in a m oment. I want to thank  you for being with us. I r emind 
you that we will have
 
Fir s t 
Per s on
 
progr am s each Wednes day and Thur sday until the middle of August. 
If you c an c ome back, we would love you 
to 
do that. Otherwis e, the webs ite will have inform ation about 
our  pr ogram  in 2017.
 
 
So when Marty goes up there, it's an opportunity for  you to
 
m aybe c hat with him a little bit, ask  
a ques tion if you didn't get a c hanc e to here.
 
 
Marty? 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Ok . I'll tell you, one of the reas ons  I do this
 
--
 
by the way, before I m oved here, to 
Washington, whic h was  about 20 years  ago, actually, it took about thr ee year s  for me jus t to enter  the 
building. But onc e I s tar ted volunteering, I r ealized s omething. I promis ed that if I do s urvive, I'll tell the 
world what happened
, n
ot s o m uc h for m e but for the people that peris hed.
 
The reas on I think  it's
 
important to lear n about this , and I'm glad to s ee so many young people her e, is  that if we don't lis ten 

and we don't lear n from  the pas t, even today, look  at all the m as s ac r es, the wars , and the fighting is  

over  nothing. Som etimes it's bec aus e of r eligion. Som etimes it's  bec aus e people find r eas ons . I still feel 
that as  hum an beings we owe it to eac h other to treat eac h other  in a c ivil m anner.
 
To s how you, even 
though I was  ver y angry and hateful and all of this, we s till behaved the way we were s uppos ed
 
to, the 
way our par ents  r ais ed us . 
 
 
One thing, I'll tell you s om ething, s ounds like I'm br agging, but being Jewis h, every r eligion 
teac hes  the s am e thing, by the way. It does n't matter  what r eligion you ar e. But life is ver y, very s ac r ed. 

And als o that you have to behave like a hum an being instead of like a pig or  an anim al or whatever. 
Somehow or another that c ame through at that par tic ular time. That was  our  tr ue test, that not just one 
of us was  like this  but we were all the s ame. Ok?  And that am azes  m e, that my par ents  or  our  parents  
did s uc h a good job on us  that we wer e able to do this .
 
 
Believe it or not, when I firs t started talking about this , this  bother ed the hec k  out of m e. How 
c om e we behaved like that. I know this  s ounds stupid, but I really
 
r em em ber  being bothered. My God, I 
didn't feel like a hum an being. I didn't. All I felt was  hate yet we did behave like that.
 
But you know 
s om ething?  Looking back  now, the way I c ontinued going on afterwards , I think I made the r ight 

c hoic es . Bec aus e I never , never c arried on any hatred to anybody. Ok?  
 
 
And one of the r eas ons I'm  proud of it, I'll tell what you it is . If I were to go with hatr ed, I would 
feel that they won. This  way I never  felt like a vic tim . I didn't want to be
 
--
 
you c all m e a s ur viv
or. I 
always  had a pr oblem with that wor d. But the point is that it was  m y values , that I felt like I was
 
--
 
even 
though I was vic timized, I don't feel like I have to go through life as  a vic tim . Bec aus e that would be my 

point
, t
hat your  own values  m atter
 a
nd what kind of per s on you ar e. 
 
 
I'll tell you, m y vengeance is  I have two good kids. Eac h one has two kids . My gr andc hildren 
ar e about as good as  I could ever hope for. They did a good job on all of them, my s on and my 

daughter. And to m e, that is  my ve
ngeanc e.
