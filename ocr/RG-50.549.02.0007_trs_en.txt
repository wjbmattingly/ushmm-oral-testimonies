Q: You™re coming through fine. 
The one thing I™m going to do 
is just tilt this slightly. 
There we go. What they
™ve asked me to do is before we
 get started talking about your 
life since coming to the 
U.S.
 is Œ there are a f Œ there were a few gaps in the video 
interview that you did almost 
10 years ago, and there were a 
Œ a short list of things that 
they wanted me to ask ab
out, to clarify certain Œ 
A: The spelling and stuff? 
Q: Well, that separately, you got that list. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: That Œ that™s something we can 
do at the end of the interview. 
A: Fine. 
Q: But there were a couple of sp ecific thi
ngs that they wanted me to ask you that 
pertained to  details regarding 
stories that you told before.  
A: Okay . 

Q: So, I™d like to start with those and th
en  move into  your life since the war ended. 
A: Fine. 
Q: In your previous interview you me
ntioned that on the Œ the march from 
Landsberg
 
Œ 
A: 
Landsberg
. 
Q: 
Landsberg
. That several guard s asked the prisone
rs to quote, sign th at I was good 
to you, that I gave you bread. 

A: Mm-hm.  

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

Q: What did they mean? What 
were they expecting of you? 
A: Well, I™ve seen it, I™ve seen the paper, I™v
e seen the paper in their hand. These were 
actually Wehrmacht guards by now, so mo st of the 
SS
 guards ran away. But as we 
were marching with these Wehrmacht guard s, 
from the lans Œ last concen tration camp , 
which was a subcamp of 
Dachau, Landsberg
, we were supposedly marching towards 
the 
Tyro lean
 mountains, and th ey knew th e ne Œ 
end was near. Of c
ourse we Œ we had 
Œ we had to push a wagon behind 
us so if anybody fell, that
 was just throw ‚em in the 
wagon, so nobody was Œ be left on the road
. And this piece of pa Œ they wrote these 
pieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, 
on the edge as they 
were marching. Here, would y
ou mind Œ would you sign this 
for me, and tell them that 
I was good to you, that I helped you, that 
I gave you some food. So me people did sign. 
I™ve seen some people sign. 
Wha-Wha-What Œ what could a 
poor Œ poor soul do? In 
the Œ they never came to me personally, but I™v
e seen them being done. So this was the 
death march, so to speak a death march b
ecause lot of people were Œ were falling like 
flies. I was one of the fortunate ones, I wa
s still strong enough because of Œ of the 
slave labor that I performed prior to that, 
of eating a little better. So, during this death 
march there was also a American Air Force ai
r raid on a munition depot very  close to a 
town called 
Würzburg, Germany
. And from there as the Œ 
th Œ as the Americans 
were bombing, I ran and I successfully escape
d. And soon after I 
was picked up by the 
United States
 Armed Forces.

Q: Th-Th-The questions I™m going to ask 
you in the next few minutes are very 
disparate, they™re Œ they™re Œ they™re not in
 chronology necessarily , but they™re, again, 
picking up on th ings th
at you mentioned befo re. Did you 
ever get over your fear of 
doctors and dentists? You referred to that. 
A: Unfortunately not. I Œ from day Œ from Œ ev
er since I™ve been out of the Œ the death 

camps, concentration camps Œ when I met 
my wife, I got married, I had Œ I had 
problem with my teeth. You know, there Œ th
ere is saying, your teeth are alright, but 
your gums have to come out, and that was 
my case, and I was deathly afraid. Once Œ I 
once ran away from a dentist in 
the army . I don™t know if I ever s Œ mentioned that to Œ 
to Œ to the Holocaust Museum. I was taken by
 another Œ another G.I. 
with Œ to Œ to go 
to the dentist because I had 
awful ba-bad teeth and pain. And I was sitting in the chair 
and I ran away from there. I™m still scared of dentists, I™m still deathly afraid of shots. 

I™ll tell you an Œ a little story about what 
happened to me a few years ago. As I 
mentioned to you before, I wa
 Œ I was involved in soccer, 
not only as a coach and a 
referee, but as a player. I was playing a so
ccer game and I got hit by a man and he 
opened my  f Œ my  forehead. I ended up in 
a hospital. And a friend of mine, the one I 

showed you on the picture in 
Œ in the wall there, took me to
 the hospital and then they 
called my wife to come to the hospital. They
 wanted to give me a tetanus shot. I would 
re Œ I refused it, I would Œ I fought it. My wi
fe almost left me because of that, she was 
so upset with me. That tetanus shot was so 
important because I was hit, and also hit a 
door, and the hor Œ door had a little steel 
[in d ecipherable]
 I was Œ and doctors fear is

still there. When I go 
to examination, I am awfully fe
arful what they going to do to 
you. Very much so, even toda
y. I™m afraid of wh en they  look fo r po Œ prostrate, you 
know, when they do
 th Œ do that little finger 
job on you. That scares
 me, that scares the 
hell out of me. When they take a little blood fr
om the fingers, that scares me. S o  that 
fear is from 
Auschwitz,
 unfortunately, because I™ve seen 
Mengele
 e-e-every day on th 
Œ on Œ on the tracks. So the 
doctors always scare me, and they sh ouldn™t, they really 
shouldn™t, not today. And especially since 
I have a daughter who is a physician. Bu t 
I™m still afra Œ a-afraid of it. I™m very much so.  

Q: Have you ever made any efforts to
 do anything about that? Have you Œ 
A: N-No. See, there are two things that I am 
afraid of. Doctors and dentists is two, and 
I™m also afraid of water. Water scares
 me for the simple reason because in 
Auschwitz
, 
I was sent t o  a 
shtraf
(ph) co mma nder once. 
Shtraf
(ph) commander meaning that they 
caught me es Œ organizing food for Jewish girls 
[indecipherable]
 commando, and they  
send you to a sin o-o-operation, so they call it 
shtraf
(ph). Sin Œ sin Œ sin comma ndo, 
which meant that we were forc
ed to cut seaweeds in wate
r. We had a chain Œ chainsaw 
like, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one 
the other end, gonna pull it, 
was like a sickle, which would cut it. And there would be a 
ka po
(ph) Œ a Œ a 
[indecipherable]
, a 
kapo
(ph), a Œ a person who was in char
ge of us behind us with the 
SS 
man, and they would 
dunk our heads in the water and 
kept us there until we could 
not breathe any mo re. So I Œ I 
Œ I went through that for a co
uple of weeks as a Œ a-a-as 
a 
shtraf 
commander, as a sin 
[indecipherable]
. So whenever Œ wh
enever we go to a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

beach or something, I only go 
up to my knees. And not one of
 my children, of the four 
kids, were swimmers, because of me. And of
 course, now they are learning a little bit. 
Some of them are Œ a couple
 of them are still afraid. 
Arsani™s
(ph) a swimmer now, his 
ti Œ his children are a swimmer. Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was 
always deathly afraid of water, because of th
e Œ because of me. So those are the things 
that scare me, scare the hell out of
 me, doctors, dentists and water.  
Q: Makes sense. I™m g o nna re-rearrange th
e microphone so it™s a little less bothersome 
for you an d you can move around better. 

A: Can you Œ 

Q: It™s fine, it™s -- that just 
gives you a little more free reign.  
A: Oh, okay. 

Q: Although it™s off s Œ the 
chronology a little bit here, I wo
uld like t Œ well, I™ll come 
back to th is, th-the Œ how you think Œ wh
at you Œ how you th ink your children have 
been affected by what happen
ed to you is something I woul
d like to talk to you about. 
A: Do you Œ you want to 
talk to me about it now? 
Q: Well Œ 

A: Okay . 
Q: All right, we™re there, so let™s Œ  let™s Œ  
A: All right, let™s Œ the children, our childre
n. Well, when I arrived to this country, 
May 10
th
, 1946, I came from the army, 
so it was a little different
 for me than the most 
survivors that arrived here, because most su
rvivors came on a diff Œ in a Œ i-in a Œ in a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

different way. I was helped with the 
United States
 armed forces and also was very 
helpful that I had an aunt living in 
Detroit
. So when I first met 
my wife, my future 
wife, we started dating, we Œ also a surviv
or, you know. She didn't
 have much family, 
I didn™t have any family, so you lonely, I™m
 lonely, let™s be lonely together, the old 
saying what is the Œ one survivor said it at 
one time, if I may use his phrase. So when  
we got mar ried, February 22
nd
, 1948, it will be 50 years comi
ng up in the next Œ th-this 
February, I asked my wife, wh
y don™t we Œ let™s not talk 
any mo re any other language 
except English. My English was fairly d
ecent except I had the ar-army language, 
which was not the cleanest language in those 
days, of course. That™s how I learned. 
And we decided Œ sh e was a little bit against 
it. She said no, we 
should talk to the 
children other languages also. She was mu ch 
smarter than me, believe me, because the 
kids today could have Œ alth
ough they speak some languag
es, but they could Œ today 
they could have learned mu ch more. So, ho
w did it affect my children? First, we 
wouldn™t talk about our experiences. Anot
her mistake we made Œ I made, anyway, it 
was Œ I™m Œ I™m taking the bl
ame for that. Reason we didn™t want to, why hurt them? 
Why let them know how much we suffered, how
 mu ch  we went through? Bu t the kids 
knew they  were different. Our children soon, 
as soon as they started school fo und out 
they were different. Number one
, they didn™t have any firs
t cousins. They  didn™t have 
any aunts and uncles. No gran
dparents. There was never a grandmother to Œ to Œ to 
hug them and kiss them or whatever. School
 functions, for parent and grandparents, 
there were never any grandparents around. We
 used to adopt grandp arents for them. In 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

Detroit we use to a-adopt a lady in the 
apartment building. She was nice, and th Œ 
Grandma Goldstein, that was her grandma. Sh
e did Œ she had one daughter, an old, old 
maid, never married, so our 
children became her grandchild
ren. So the kids were Œ 
knew they Œ and yet they knew, they knew
 why so mething was wr
ong, but we never 
talked about it. The only time 
the kids would Œ our son wa
s the first one, who was the 
oldest. When I joined 
this soccer team in 
Detroit
, which by the way was founded by 
German Jews who arrived to 
United States
 in the 30™s, just before 
Hitler
 got to them. 
And I joined  this team and pr
etty soon Œ there was a tryout
 Œ pretty soon there were 
more survivors joining this team. So afte
r soccer games we would go to someone™s 
home, yours, mine or someone else™s and 
had a cookout or dinner, or whatever. We 
would start talking about the game, then we
 would start talking about our lives in 
America, how Œ how are we doing, how mu
ch money do you make
. And befo re you 
knew it, 
Auschwitz 
would come to the Œ to Œ into th
e Œ in to the co nversation. And our 
children, especially our son, would always
 listen from be Œ from behind the door. And 
Œ and he knew Œ he Œ then 
he wo uld tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something 
about Daddy, or I heard something about 
Mom, about wh at ha Œ what happened to 
them in the camps. So we didn
™t want to talk about these 
experiences to them. And ar 
Œ then, let me tell you about the Œ th
e Œ the Œ the local Jewish population. 
Detroit
 is a 
big metropolitan city with a large Jewish 
population. We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes 
went to a school to learn English. I 
Œ at the Jewish Co
mmunity Center in 
Detroit
, and 
our soccer team will also meet there. So, I di dn™t go to that school because I Œ I Œ I Œ I 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
10
felt I Œ I had enough of schooling, which wa
s another mistake. Would have listened to 
my  wife I probably would ha
ve been sometime a teacher today somewhere. So  we Œ 
then we tried to tell the local population, 
the local Jewish popu
lation, our Œ our own 
people in Œ in the Jewish 
Co mmu nity Center. We had a Pu rim play, we went to a 
Purim play, and then  all of a sudden we
 start talking to  these people about 
Auschwitz
, 
no Œ numb er of us in the soccer team. And th
e leader of the group says, that™s en ough 
about 
Auschwitz
. Let™s go back  to singing and play
ing the music a g ain. So nobody 
want to listen. My own aunt, may she rest 
in peace, my father™s youngest sister, who 
lost everybody in her family, she lost two si
sters, she lost  her brother, she lost al l her 

nieces and nephews and Œ and 
Œ and Œ and all her cousins,
 she wouldn™t Œ she, coming 
in 1939, emigrating to th
is country in 1939 from 
Vienna, Austria,
 she didn™t want to 
listen. So we decided not to 
talk about it. The first time I 
was able to talk about it was 
when  our youngest daughter asked my  wife 
to come to her eighth grade junior high 
school to speak, and th e next day my  wife fo
rced me to go there. Yet, I didn™t tell them 
a story like the story should be told . I kind 
of whitewashed it. I 
was afraid to hurt 
people. So that took a 
long time. So my 
children, at f Œ at first th
ey were resentful, they 
said Daddy, why didn™t you te
ll us? Why Œ you know, th Œ 
they didn™t come and Œ and 
say to me, you Œ you Œ you we
re wrong, you Œ you sh ould ha
ve done it. But you could 
have told  us. I didn™t want to hurt you honey. 
This Œ this is simple, it™s a Œ it the o Œ 
it™s the way it is, I™d Œ it just Œ I don™t wa
nt to hurt strangers, let alone my  own 
children. So they™re different
. But today they™re very much
 involved. My daughter, the 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

oldest one, the physician was on the Ho
locaust Committee with me, which I am a 
chairman of 
[indecipherable]
 local Œ local Holocaust
 Committee called Jewish 
Committee Relations. Both Œ all three of th
e daughters went to second generation 
meetings, second generation of Ho locaust su
rvivors. In ninete Œ January 27, 1985, I 
took two of my  children, my  son and 
my middle daughter, 
the New York er, the 
jeweler, with me to 
Auschwitz
 for the comme mo ration of the 40
th
 anniversary of 
Auschwitz
 being liberated, if you can 
call being liberated by the 
Sov i et Unio n
 a 
liberation. And they came there.
 I showed them, first of all 
Auschwitz
 number one, 
that was the first camp  that I was taken to. 
I showed them the barra
ck that my father 
was last taken to, block seven in 
Auschwitz
, called the 
Krankenbau
, the sick bay. 
Sick bay without doctors. I showed them th
at barrack. This is where they took my Œ 
your grandfather last time, to the ovens 
from. I showed them block 16 where I s Œ 
where I was living on the Œ which 
by the way, block 16 today in 
Auschwitz
 is the 
Czechoslo vakian block, a-a-and they have so
me artifacts in there. And we spend there 
a couple da Œ two days in 
Auschwitz
. And then of course in 1990, I went back  again to 
Auschwitz
, but this time I took agn Œ took 
Agnes
 with me, the same middle daughter 
and the youngest daughter. This is
 where we made a film called, ﬁ
Auschwitz
, If You 
Cried, You Died.ﬂ So I sh Œ there I really 
pored  my  heart out to my  ch ildren, to show 
them what Auschwitz is all about, what it wa
s all about. I took them to every Œ see I 
was working as a slave laborer, a place called 
Ka na da
 commando, unloading 
incoming Jews from every Œ every Nazi occupi
ed  European country. And th is is where 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
12
I gave my  two daughters and my  wife, who has not been to 
Auschwit z
, their exact 
feeling what 
Auschwitz
 was about. I explained to them crematorium one Œ 
crematorium one, which is in 
Auschwitz
 number one, which is st
ill standing. Then  we 
went to 
Birkenau
, which is the 
Auschwitz 
number two camp, and I showed  them the 
crematorias
(ph). I worked as a slave laborer at 
Birkenau
, 600 yard s from the gas 
chambers and 
crematorias
(ph). So the kids today know mu
ch more than 
they should 
have known years ago, which I was a
fraid to tell them, 
to hurt them.  
Q: What ways Œ so much to 
talk about at th Œ I™m Œ I™m 
Œ I™m trying to think in  terms 
of doing this in a Œ in an order that would 
be useful to future people listening to this, 
but other ways your children were affected, 
you Œ you talk about th
at they have, in a 
second hand fashion abs Œ abso rbed some of yo
ur fears. Have Œ is that something th at 
you™ve ever talked to th
em about over the years? 
A: About my fears? Well, the kids were always
 afraid that they woul
d hurt me i-if they 
would talk to me about my fears b ecause 
you know, it™s bad en ough that I had it, you 
know? My son tried a number of times, he sa
ys, Dad, you know, you can go to water. 
You can swim with the Œ look at your gran
dchildren, look at yo
ur little granddaughter, 
she dives from this big diving board. He says
, you don™t have to dive, but you can go 
in the water deeper than
 you go into water. They tried it, but I Œ I Œ I-I Œ i Œ we were in 
Israel, we just got back fro
m Israel last week. We went
 to the swimming pool. There 
were kids playing with a ball, I was playing 
soccer with them, you know, in a group. I 
didn™t want to go in  that water. I went. Little
 Œ little above my knees, and anything that 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
13
Œ a-as soon as I feel the water above, I get 
scared, still to this day. So the fears, well, 
the kids tried, but s Œ you know.  
Q: Have you ever done anything Œ I don™t wa
nt to dwell on this t
oo much, but in terms 
of your Œ your fear 
of docto rs and dentists, have y
ou Œ you know, there are certain 
dentists, for example, who specialize in pe
ople who are phobic about dentistry, and 
who, you know, are particular
ly sensitive to that, and Œ 
A: The only way any dentist could touch my t
eeth, or es Œ extract them, have to put me 
to sleep. That™s Œ I Œ no other way I would have
 done it. Yet, when I lost all these teeth 
Œ of course, I Œ when  I got out of 
Auschwitz
 I had hard ly  any teeth left, but when I lost 
the rest of them, this guy, this dentist was 
very gentle, whom I s
till have Œ course, now 
I don™t need him, I only got thr-three teeth 
left. But even then, 
he knows how sensitive 
I am. When he cleans the rema
ining on my  teeth, he ma kes sure that I get enough 
Novocain into me that I don™t feel not even
 his Œ I don™t even feel his finger. My lips 
and mouth is frozen for a whole day after that
. So I Œ i-i-I Œ I don™t know, I don™t think 
I would want to be the docto r 
that I should be his patient. 
Q: Out of curiosity, I know 
you™ve Œ again, we™re jump ing 
ahead, I know th at you™ve 
had a lot of contact with other survivors in the past decade or mo re. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Are Œ do you share common fears along those lines? 

A: There are some of us that have the same fears, and especially those of us who Œ 
unfortunately two of them are Œ two of them 
died in the recent years Œ those of us who 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
14
spent in 
Auschwit z
 more than two years, because we
 didn™t live through because of 
doctors, because the doctors were  there to kill you. But they 
had the same fears. I have 
one friend who died  in 
Skokie
 al Œ two years ago, 
Joe Neumann
(ph). You Œ you 
mentioned his name 
[indeciphera ble]
 misspelled it anyway, but Joe was the same as 
me. He had Œ unfortunately, he died of 
an aneurism and Œ and a heart problem two 
years ago. He was the strongest prisoner 
ever, among us. He was seven years Œ se-
seven, eight years older than me and he lo
oked like a real -- a real born Nazi. He had 
blonde, blue eyed Œ blon
de hair, blue eyes. And 
Mengele
 liked him so much that he 
never believed he was Jewish. He 
never Œ he always told him, 
Du bist kein J u de 
nicht
 Œ you™re not a Jew. You 
Œ you are Œ you are a German
. And he spoke pretty Œ 
pretty good German, too. We all did from 
Slovakia
, you know. So we Œ we Œ and the 
other guy in f Œ in his hist Œ 
he was historian, his name was 
Eric Kulka. Eric Kulka
 
was a Œ wr-wrote a number of books. In fact
, he wrote th e first book, him and another 
guy in pra Œ li Œ who lives in 
Prague
, his name is 
Ota Kraus
, they wrote the book 
called, ﬁThe Death Factory.ﬂ Started in 19
47, you can imagine, not even two years 
after Auschwitz, they started this book. And I 
happen to  have a copy of it also, but it Œ 
that book was printed in many, many languages. And this guy 
Kulka
, he too had fears 
of doctors. 
Q: Makes sense. 

A: We™ve seen what do

the injection, the shots, th-the Œ the penal 
what do you call it? The Œ the Œ th e shot that 
kills you that th-they use in the pri Œ in prisons when the death sent
ence fe Œ then th Œ 
so they give you shots to k ill you for Œ from a death row. 
Q: I don™t know what chemical that is. 
A: Phenyl Œ penal Œ some kind of a thing. 
Well, I Œ I can™t think of the name now, I™m 

sure it™ll co me to me. And these we
re the shots that were given in  
Germany
, in Œ in 
the Œ in Œ in Œ in th
e concen tration camp s. 
Q: What about other fears, general fears?
 When you Œ wh en yo
u were here, when Œ 
when the war was over, when you were Œ I do
n™t know when we want to start talking 
about this, but you must Œ I™m assuming yo
u had some other fears, fears of Œ  
A: Well, let me just Œ okay. 

Q: Œ of the police, fears of Œ 

A: Well le-let me Œ let me start with th
e fears. When I was 
first picked up in 
United 
States
 Armed Fo rces, number one I didn™t sp
eak any Œ speak English. I spoke 
German, I spoke Hungarian, I spoke Ru ssian
, I spoke Polish. And the only reason I got 
along with the army, because th
ere was some people that we
re born in this country of 
Polish parents, of Czech parents, of Slovak
 parents and then I could communicate with 
them. And there was a guy from 
Boston,
 of all places, and Œ 
a Jewish fellow by the 
name of 
Feldma n
, he was a schoolteacher. And he wo
uld teach me English, how did 
he teach me English? By making me read ﬁS
tars and Stripesﬂ and also the army sent 
me to a sch ool in Œ in 
Germany
, in occupied 
Germany
, I and E school. Info rmation

education. Who was this school for? This sc
hool war Œ was not for people to Œ to learn 
English, this was people from Œ from the 
illiterates. People from the south Œ and I™m 
sorry not Œ I hope that nobo
dy who listens to me, I don™t think everybody in the south 
doesn ™t know how to  read. But these were 
guys who didn™t go to
 schools. And they 
had to write home letters from th e armed for
ces. It was Œ they Œ 
they knew how to 
carry a gun and shoot it, but they had pr
oblem reading or writing. So the ar Œ 
Feldman 
was teaching this class called I and E, info
rmation education. An
d there would be a 
blackboard and on th is blackboard there would 
be a letter. Dear folks, today I am in 
Frankfurt
. I am fine, hope you are too. Love, your son 
John
. And I would l-learn 
how to read and write 
that way, plus this 
Feldman
 made me read ﬁStars and Stripes.ﬂ 
And he would teach me English. I have 
a knack for languages and I learned the 
language quite Œ quite qu-quick ly in th Œ 
the American language, as well as other 
languages.  
Q: We were talking about fears Œ 
A: Fears. 

Q: Œ and how you dealt with them over the years Œ 

A: Ah Œ oh Œ okay Œ  
Q: Œ other types of fears. 
A: All right, I™m sorry. 

Q: It™s okay. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
17
A: Well, I got you Œ I 
got you this one. No w, fears in th
e army. I had fears in the army. 
Any time I™ve seen soldiers march , I™ve al
ways looked  back to see who was behind 
me. Those were the other fears. There wa
s a Red Cross field director who had a 
woman working for him, woman Red Cross, al
so a field dire Œ field person. She was 
from 
Milwaukee
. Her name was 
Wanda Waleiko
(ph)
 Wanda Waleiko
(ph) was like 
a psychia Œ psych-psychologist and sh e was in 
charge of me. She would always talk to 
me, try to get me back into Œ the ar Œ 
of course, in those days you didn™t have 
psychiatrists like you have toda
y. And she would try to talk to me and calm me  down, 
and Œ and Œ and she was the one who tried to
 get the fear away 
from me, because she Œ 
they knew  Œ soon I Œ when  I 
ran away from the dentist th
ey knew that something is 
wrong with me, that th  Œ something has to 
be done. And I reme mb er they gave me a 
capsule to take to calm me down. And I don™t 
know how to take this
 capsule. So what 
I™ve done, I opened th e capsule and I put the powd er in my  hand from the ca Œ th-the 
contents into  Œ and it was awfully bitter and 
that™s what I took. I didn™t know that you 
can take the capsule and just swallow it 
and it dissolves. Who knew that, you know, 
from where? So, fears? Then I ca
me to this country, I had fears here. I had awful fears 
here. I was afraid of policemen. I was afraid 
of anything that Œ that had au thority over 
me. See, I had my first job in this countr
y in Detroit, Michigan
. And my uncle, who 
was my  Œ my  Œ my  aunt™s husband, he was a c p Œ accountan t, 
C.P.A
. And he would 
help me, reading the 
Detro i t
 News and 
Detroit™s 
Free Press to Œ in the a Œ want ads. 
And there was an ad in the paper, foreign sp
eaking salesman wanted . So  my  uncle put 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
18
me on a streetcar, and I went there. That™s 
how I got my first job. And first job was 
working in the Œ 
in the store, 
Zo l c a r a
(ph) department stores in 
Detroit Michigan
 on 
Jefferson Avenue
. And th e store Œ we would sell merchandise to foreign people, 
Americans that were Œ came from a foreign 
co untry. That would Œ now, war is over, 
they had relatives in 
Europe
, in 
Poland
, in 
Hungary
 and wherever. They would 
receive letters from Œ from their relatives a
nd we would read the letters and they said, 
Anna need s a pair of pants, 
John
 needs a pair of shoes. Here is a piece of string, this is 
the size of his foot. Here™s a piece of string, th
is is size of his wais
t, for pants. And that 
Œ so that™s what we used to 
do, that™s how Œ that™s Œ that ma Œ was my first job. Then I 
wa Œ started to lose a little f Œ little Œ little fear
 already, but I was still, if I can say it in 
those wo rds, I didn™t have the trust, the fa
ith. I™d a Œ I was always a Œ always afraid 
that Œ that Œ th-that it™s too 
good, you know, that it can™t be
, th-th-that™s Œ you know. I 
always look behind, who is behind me. And 
it took me a long time. Took me a very 
long time, took me 
a very long time. 
Q: How long? Years, decades? 

A: I would say it took years, 
years. Five, six years or better. When I met my  wife, and 
we started getting the children, even then I 
was always fearful, always very fearful 
about my  kids. It shouldn™t happen  to 
them what happened to th e kids in 
Auschwitz
. 
So it took a long time. And the nightmares, 
you know, they  were there for a long time, 
and Œ and let me tell y ou, even to this da
te, they don™t stop. 
You know wh en they  
come the strongest on? Let™s say I™m invited 
to speak at a university or a high school 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
19
or college or civic or Œ or religious orga
nization. And while I™
m speaking, I™m fine. 
Now the questions come, and the questions 
bring back  Œ bring out mo re than actual 
presentation because Œ see it Œ while I™m sp
eaking, I don™t use any text. I never, never, 
never use a piece of paper when I speak. I 
Œ I can™t stand reading my life story at 
Auschwitz
. But when I™m speaking, I™m reliv ing my time in 
Auschwitz
, my  ti me in  
Sach senhausen
, my time in 
Landsberg
 and so on. And I Œ then I gotta Œ and it™s all 
there in front of you. Now you see yourself, 
you actually see in your own visual mind, 
you see the days that you unload ed, the 
days that the selections are made at 
Auschwitz
. So you see all that, you know. So yo
u live that Œ you relive that. Now I™m 
finished the presentation. I™m driving ho
me from 60, 70, sometime 100 miles out of 
the state, sometimes be diffe
rent states. And as I go home I™m Œ now I™m trying to 
calm my self down. I go to bed at night and 
I get nightmares. You know that Œ never a 
day goes by that 
Auschwitz
 doesn™t come ba Œ come in your head . And it isn™t 
because they  tattoo a number 
on my arm. That is, you know
, here I am. The same way 
with my children as they got older. I tried 
to tell them a little more
 about it, you know, 
and then  Œ now they ™re in college. You wo rry
 about them away fro
m home. Then they  
come home with boyfriends. Y
ou know, from the Œ from the 
Œ from the day they were 
born, when there was bris, when there was a 
circumcisio n , people are there, my a Œ my 
aunt, my wife™s uncle is the 
godfather, and you™re looking fo
r people to come to your Œ 
there. I™m looking fo r the people that ne
ver sh ow up. I™m looking th e people that I 
wanted to be there, they™re not there. Ou
r ya Œ oldest daughter got engaged. Yo ung

20
man came to ask for her hand. And I Œ I br
oke down something terrible. Broke down 
something terrible, from happiness and sadness.
 Here I™ve got a daughter who is ready 
to get married. She will never see her gran
dmother, never see her 
cousins, never see 
anyone else  at her wedding, you know. And 
th en, wh en  there is happiness and sadness, 
who do you share it with? Ju
st with the immediate family. Your wife and your 
children. And your children try to calm you 
down , they  try to come to you and, you 
know. And I feel very sad about those th
ings, you know. Now ou
r little daughter in 
Switzerland is gonna make us grandparents, 
okay? So  here she is, 4,000 miles away 
from us. And my wife and I, we insist we™re 
going to  be there when the kid is born but 
how do we Œ how do you figure 
that out? Yeah, so Œ yeah.  
Q: When you were there in the army camp 
after the liberation, did they understand 
what had happened to  you? 

A: When I first got
 picked up by the 
United States
 Armed Fo rces, called 774 tank 
battalion, this was before the camps were even
 near. They were Œ this was quite a ways 
from any camp, away from 
Dachau
. And when I showed th
em this number, when I 
told them what it™s all abou
t, this Polish American from 
Chicago
 brings over his 
captain, his name was Captain 
Yogerling
(ph), and he brings hi
m over who is a Œ who 
was an attorney from home. And he™s try Œ 
he™s telling him what I tell him in Polish 
what happened. They  were sh
-shrugging their shoulder. They  had no idea wh at I Œ wh-
what I Œ wh at I came from. They seen a 
guy who Œ who weighed 
nothing, like me, I 
was a Œ a skinny sk eleton runt. And th ey tried 
to feed Œ first of all they cleaned me up 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
21
from head to toe, th
ey had the Œ they had these trav
eling showers, what the army 
shower had carried around, they were wide
 open and they had water, and they  had a 
little shower head and then 
they gave you so ap and 
DDT
 powder to spray you. And 
then they gave me clean uniform, clean fa
tigue, clean pair of boots. First time I had 
underwear on in almost three y
ears, an-and socks and pair of Œ pair of army  boots. And 
tried to tell them, they knew 
nothing until they h
it the first concentration camp. And 
even then  they didn™t understand. They ™re
 seeing this mass of bodies coming out of 
cattle cars, gotta Œ or coming 
out of Œ just walking over 
dead people. They couldn™t 
understand how could anybody do 
this to anybody. A
nd then I start to tell them. See, 
this is what happened in 
Auschwitz
. This is what happened 
in the camps, in the Nazi 
death camps. And th en, of course, they starte
d, you know, being ro wdy on the streets. 
Every time they seen a German
 on the bicycle they kick ed
 him off, took his bicycle. 
They  did all sorts of things 
just to Œ they want
 to beat up every German they™ve seen 
on th e street. Of course the Œ the officers 
stopped them because he
 Œ you Œ you don™t Œ 
America you don™t Œ you don™t do these things in 
America
, you don™t do these things 
in war. So they di Œ really 
didn™t know, didn™t have the s
lightest idea. And they didn™t 
know how to treat us. What they would 
do? Every American, naïve, goodhearted 
American 
Joe
 would give y
ou Œ this G.I. Joe would give 
you his k Œ K rations, his C 
rations, feed the heck  out 
of you, give you a sh Œ 
Hershey 
bar, and then top it off with 
a cigarette, with a 
Camel
 cigarette. And in the meanwhile, they were killing you, 
because th Œ our bodies couldn
™t take the food. The mal-nut
ritious body just could not 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
22
take that type of treatment. Then the medics
 came, so what did th ey do? They  came to 
these camp s and they took 
their uniforms off and burne
d them, and put on whatever 
clothes they could get from 
UNRRA
, from any organization, th
ey  start putting clothes 
on us. As good as they were, 
thousands and thousands of survivors died after ha Œ after 
the Œ after liberation. 
Q: Just because they didn™
t know what to do for you. 
A: They didn™t know what to
 do with us, until the medica
l groups came when they 
finally decided that that™s not the way to 
treat them. And then, of
 course, then they 
opened the displaced person camps
, and which I was not part of ba Œ part of one, but Œ 
and I™ve seen displaced person camps, and let 
me tell you, I™m glad I wasn™t a part of 
one, because displaced person camps were just
 like camp s. They were not like Nazi Œ  
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Michael Vogel
. This is tape number one, side
 B
. And as the tape was ending you 
were explaining that because of malnouri
shment, that when you would Œ wh en  the 
G.I.s
 in their Œ in their well-
meaning way would give you 
food that was too rich for 
you and in too large quantities and that it Œ 
your bodies couldn™t 
handle it. What was it 
like for you when  they
 first gave you fo od? 
A: Well, when I was picked up at the 
United States
 forces, and Œ and the field kitchen 
was operating, you Œ y
ou Œ they  had all field kitchens
, I don™t know if you know wh at 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
23
a field kitchen is, but it™s an army  unit kitche
n. And th ey tried to f Œ they fed me too, 
and I had a problem. The first thing is, the 
food went right through me. And I was very 
fortunate, we had a medic on Œ with us, a me dical unit with us, and th ey gave me some 
Œ some Œ some coal tablets, you know, charco
al tablets to stop Œ stop my  Œ my  Œ my  Œ 
my  Œ  my  Œ 

Q: Diarrhea? 

A: Diarrhea. And one of the doctors tried to
 s-say di Œ don™t give him so mu ch food, 
you know. Of course that™s 
easy for Œ for him to say don™t give me so mu ch food, 
because he didn™t stand in the c
how line wi Œ like I did. I had a 
[indecipherable]
 on 
the chow line and I piled it up. Of course
, it got better with me, I was one of the 
fortunate ones for this reason, because I was a 
Kanada
 worker, I was also in a better 
physical shape than the other prisoners 
were. So I had a little 
more. Although I had 
swollen eyes and swollen feet and swollen 
hands from malnutrition, but I was not as 
bad off as the other ones. So it to
ok less time for me to digest 
Œ to Œ to  Œ to Œ to be able 
to digest the food. And it took awhile, I wo
uld say it took a couple of weeks at least, 
but I was always hungry. I was always the fi
rst one in the chow line. And then I st Œ 
then, of course, put me to wo
rk  in the kitchen, see, and 
I was working you n Œ in Œ in 
the mess kitchen. So that was even better. 
And we had a Œ we had a cook, this mess 
sergeant, I don™t know if you know wh at a me
ss sergeant is. That™s 
the guy who is in 
charge of th e army  ki-kitchen. He has cook
s under him. His name was sad sack, they 
used to call him sad sack. And 
he would kind of take care of
 me and we used to Œ he 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
24
used to go in to town  and Œ and we 
used to Œ he-he was stationed in  
Furth, Germany
, 
f-u-r-t-h
, which is a s Œ a suburb of 
Nuremberg
. But I found out of course, many 
years later, 
Henry Kissinger
 came from 
Furth
. And he would go to this small town , 
go to the farm, steal a few chickens, steal so
me fresh milk and brin
g them back to the 
G.I.s, 
bring them back to the kitchen. And we
 had fresh eggs. Normally we used to 
have powder eggs, the army  
powder eggs. And he would take
 me with him in the Jeep 
and we would go organi
ze. The reason he took me with him, because I spoke German. 
For a couple of cigarettes he would get anythi
ng he wanted in a farm
 Œ farm place. So 
for me it™s Œ didn™t take as long to get do
wn  to the system where I could eat.  
Q: What other physical prob
lems did you have once they 
Œ you were there with the 
army? 
A: Well, at Auschwitz, my fingers and my 
toes were frozen. So, I had very poor 
circulation in my  Œ in my  hands, in my  
feet, my  blood circulation. And wh en I was 
examined, which I can show you,
 when  I was sworn in to the 
United States
 Armed 
Forces, when I was examined by the medical 
group of Œ in  the army , they did find a 
little Œ they don™t put it down there as mu
ch, but they found so me wrong. I had 
cracked fingers, my fingers 
opened up because of the fro
ze Œ ba Œ frostbite and same 
thing with my toes. My Œ a
ll my hair fell off from my le
gs, and that was because the 
blood circulation was poor. A
nd my fingers, even to this 
date, when it s Œ gets real 
cold, tips of my fingers get white, even wi
th  gloves on. So that was one medical 
problem I had. Other than that, I didn™t 
have too many problems, medical problems, 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
25
except being afraid of docto rs and not going 
to  one and probably if
 I would have gone 
to doctors and th ey would have
 possibly gave me some sort 
of mediation to Œ to Œ to 
make me better, I probably wo
uld have been better. But I Œ 
I Œ I healed quite fast.  
Q: Did th e 
G.I.s
 there, did they  ask you about what
 had happened to  you? Were they Œ 
A: I found some of them that got to be in
terested much later. See, when I was with Œ 
picked up by the army , last days of ni Œ o-of March 19 twe Œ 1945, first part of ma Œ 
April. April 6, 1945, Presiden
t Roosevelt died, and I was alr
eady in with this unit. 74 Œ 
774 tank battalion, and I reme mb er over th
e army  radio system came the news and 
everybody was so hushed up ab ou
t it, so you know, President 
Roo sev elt 
died. That 
was April 6
th
, 1945. And by then I was getting, y
ou know, much better. 
So some of the 
boys after the war, May 8
th
, 1945, some of the boys Œ I found a couple of Jewish boys 
in the sa Œ in the unit. One would not eat 
un-kosher food, so he was given special Œ 
special food. And th is guy wanted to know 
more, a little bit more about it, and since he 
found out that most of th
e Jews were murdered in 
Europe
, so he started asking me the 
questions, so I would talk to him a little bit 
about it. Then, was a chaplain there also, 
and the ch ap lain would ask, but very few pe
ople really cared, because you know, here 
were these young boys, 19 Œ 
20 Œ 21 years old boys away from those Œ 4,000 miles 
away from their home, they would sing [sings
] I™ll be home for Christma s, 1945, you 
know. Or singing th at type of song and wo
rrying ab out one thing only, letters from 
home. Mail call was th e biggest thing in the 
world because you were late Œ letter from 
your mo m, from your girlfriend, from your 
brothers, from your sisters and this was the 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
26
big thing. I was a small fry. Here I was, 
a Jewish boy who survived  concen tration 
camps they knew nothing ab out. And not only
 they knew nothing about, some of them 
could care less. To them a crap game was mo re interesting th an my story, which I 
didn™t tell, to certain groups. I tell you, th
is Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a Œ came 
from a Spanish type of family, and he was 
very much interested. He was a relig ious 
person and he wanted  to know what ha Œ wh y 
did the Jew Œ why did they do it to Jews, 
he would ask me. I wish I could tell you why 
they do it Œ did it to Jews. But the Jews 
were the one earmarked for ba 
Œ to be Œ to be mu rdered. 
And he was the only one that 
I would conver Œ oh, and the teacher, sorry, 
Feldman
, who came from 
Boston
. He was 
another one, he wanted to know wh at
 happened, because his parents and his 
grandparents came from somewhere in eastern 
Euro pe
. But other than that most of 
them get a furl
ough to go to 
Paris
 to have a good time with  the girls. That was the 
main thing. Get a weekend pass, or go to
 town. We were stationed then still in 
Germany, but on the way from 
Germany
 towards 
France
, because this unit, 770 Œ 
774 tank battalion, these boys
 had enough points Œ and let 
me explain wh at the points 
were. Points were, if y ou served in service 
that such and such Œ 
long time, you were 
given points for each month. 
And if you were married and 
had family, that was extra 
points, so you could come home earlier. No
w this bat-battalion, 
774 tank battalion was 
ready to go home in September 
1945. Now here they go from 
Germany
 with a convoy 
we going towards 
France
. We ended up in  the camp called 
Camp Lucky Strike
. 
Camp Lucky Strike
, the ne Œ Holo caust Museum ha
s a photograph of me in the 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

Camp Lucky Strike
, in a tent picture, I™m Œ I™m in a tent over there. Outside a tent, 
I™m sorry. And now we come to 
LaHavre, France
. And here™s an interesting story. 
I™m sure I told this to
 the Holocaust Museum, but I™m goi
ng to repeat it if I Œ if I did, 
so I™ll repeat it. 
LaHavre, France
 was an embarkation, it wa
s the Œ this ab Œ th Œ 
where the camp Œ embarkation camp, this is
 where you got on sh ips to go back home. 
Now here is my unit going on a 
ship called Lieutenant Colonel 
James Barker
. That™s 
the troop carrier. The na Œ that ship is named after this co lonel. 
Now they don™t know 
what to do with me. Th
ey wanted to put me on a ship , and I™m ready to go. I would be 
going on the ship w
ith them to go to 
United States
. Well, Captain 
Yogerling
(ph), who 
is an attorney from home says, w e™re gonna 
get him in trouble. What they wanted to 
do, the other captain wanted to do, take him Œ go in to 
Bo sto n ,
 to Œ tha-that was our Œ 
the Œ they  would stop in Boston,
 we would get discharged in 
Bo ston
, get our Œ get our 
papers in 
Bo sto n
, and then leave for 
Bo sto n
. Get our papers and everything else. 
Discharge papers. Well, Captain 
Yogerling
(ph) felt if I™m going to
 be put on a ship Œ 
the other captain said, let™s take him on with
 us, put him on th e sh
ip and when  we get 
to 
Boston
, turning him in to the au
thorities, to immigration o
ffice, and tell them he™s 
got an aunt here he Œ he can
 go to  his aunt. No w, Captain 
Yogerling
(ph), who is an 
attorney from home, this is nut
s, this is illegal entry to 
United Sta tes
 and he will be 
punished, he will Œ he will be sent Œ sent 
back to where Œ wher
ever they send him 

back. So Captain 
Yogerling
(ph) decided un Œ took me on a 
Jeep
, with my duffle bag Œ 
and the guys collected money. 
The Œ the Œ my  group, comp any 
A
, which I was with,

they collected dollars to give
 me, you know, to Œ so I have some money with  me. They 
took me Œ Captain 
Yogerling
(ph) drove me to Camp  
Home Run
, wh ich was Œ that 
was the name of the camp , which was an 
embarkation camp, but I™m going to tell you 
what the camp meant Œ may be an embarkation. Replacement troops. This is what the 
troops will be coming to  replace the troops 
that went home. And I went to the Camp 
Home Run
, the Captain 
Yogerling
(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp 
commander. And the camp comm ander kind of 
welcomed me, they got Œ they stuck 
me with the name 
Chesskey
(ph), you know, that was th
e Œ that was given to me 
already by this unit. Captain
 Yogerling
(ph) said that™s what they call him, 
Chesskey
(ph). So  I got into this camp, and wh at I be gi Œ wh at kind of job th ey give 
me? To be in charge of a officer™s dr
y cleaning and laundry, manned by German 
prisoners, all right? First thi
ng the captain of Œ of Œ of 
Home Run
, Captain
 Home Run  
tells me who was in charge of us
 in that area. He says to me, 
Chesskey
(ph), you™re 
going to  be work ing, you™re goin g to be in
 charge of this laundry. No w, there are 
German prisoners there. We didn™t come he
re to make concentra
tio n camp s, we came 
here to bring demo cracy. And th at™s what 
it was. I was th ere, I was sworn into the 

United States
 Armed Forces at Camp
 Home Run
 with another fellow, whose name is 
also misspelled on th e list you have, whose name was 
Raymond Dela fonte
(ph) 
Quinones
(ph).
 
He was a Spaniard, not Je
wish. Now we sworn into  
United States
 
Armed Forces. However, it was a wr
ong form, a regular army form. 
United States
 has 
two armies. Army of 
United Sta tes
 and regular army . Well, the colonel who swore us 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

in tipped 
[indeciphera ble]
 over it and put down Army of 
United States
, sent it to the 
war department of 
Washington
. Oh, I would say a couple of months later, came back 
disapproved. Attached new forms to re-sign.
 In the meanwhile, my
 aunt was found in  
Detroit, Michigan
. There was a Jewish chaplain whose na Œ are also from 
Chicago,
 in 
Camp
 Home Run
, whose name was 
Michael Lipschitz
(ph), and 
Michael 
Lipschitz
(ph), I to Œ showed him I f Œ my  aunt
 was found too, by the Red Cross and 
by th e army, wh at do I do? He went to the co
lonel, the comp any Œ the Œ the Œ th -the Œ 
the Œ the camp comma nder and he told him the 
story, so I didn™t have to re-sign. 
Raymond Dellafonta
(ph)
 Qu inon es
(ph), soon as he signed the new papers, was 
shipped to 
South Pacific.
 And this what would happen
 to me. Now waiting for my 
aunt papers to come, and th e army papers 
came, the army gave me referral to go to 
Czechoslovakia
 go pick up some passports and Œ 
and Œ an-and birth certificates. But 
sha Œ never got a birth certific
ate. Passport I bought in Œ in
 Paris at the Czech embassy, 
and I came to this Œ and that™s how I came to  
United States
. 
Q: Where did you Œ did you go to 
Boston? 
Did you Œ 
A: No. When I came to 
United States
? No, no, I didn™t go 
with Œ on a ship.  
Q: So you flew? 
A: I flew on 
TWA.
 It was a Œ they had e-e-emergenc
y flights, like for instance, let™s 
say a 
G.I.™s 
mo ther is dying, or died, they woul
d Œ they would fly him home. And I 
was on one of those planes and I was on th e st
andby, and they had found a seat for me. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
30
And I came to 
United States
 May 10
th
, 19 Œ May Œ May 10
th
, 1946. Took 17 hours to 
get here by 
TWA
 flight. 
Q: Had you ever been
 in a plane before? 
A: No. 
Q: I didn™t think so. 

A: Never. 

Q: What was that like? 
A: Scary, because first of all it was very no
isy. Awfully noisy . We stopped in Œ in Œ in 
Iceland
. That™s where we, I guess Œ 
Q: Refueled. 

A: Œ refueled, yeah. And I was 
scared t-to death. I came to 
New York
 on a Saturday  
morning. I went to s Œ went to a family 
that knew my  family, that knew my  aunt and 
also knew my  parents. These were religious Jews, of course Œ 

Q: How Œ how did you find th
em? How did you find out Œ 
A: Oh th ey Œ I got my  aunts Œ my  aunt gave
 me the information. 
Oh, I got to Œ they 
were the ones who helped my  au nt to Œ to 
Œ to  get transportation for me. There Œ they 
were in Œ fur manufacturers in 
New York City
, quite Orthodox religious. Very Œ in 
fact, very Orthodox religious. And I arrive 
on a Saturday, Saturday 
morning. So I went 
through the immigration office and you gotta 
pay head tax, six dollars head tax. And I 
had money sewn in a duffle bag, but I didn™t want to 
[indecipherable]
 duffle bag 
[indecipherable]
 because they told me
 that you™re only allo
wed to bring so mu ch

money. I didn™t have six dollars. So the i
mmi gration officer was 
a Jewish guy and he 
paid for me, and he says, I know. I saw y Œ I tried to call the 
Birman
(ph) family, the 
people that I went to, they lived in 
Brooklyn
. And he says, don™t 
even try calling him. 
They won™t answer this Œ the phone on a Saturday. So he put
 me on a subway  to get to 
Brooklyn.
 And that™s how I got to the people
. I knocked on the door, I Œ and they 
were Œ had the Sabbath lunch. I come over there and then  they direct me to the 
bathroom, and what do I do in the bathroom? 
I shave. One of the son comes in he says, 
you don™t do this on Saturday
. I come out, eat lunch, put a cigarette in my  mouth. You 
can™t smoke on Saturday. So the old man, Mr. 
Birman
(ph)
 
says to me now, you know, 
I am not God™s policeman, but you can™t s-
s-smoke here on Sh ab bas Œ on Sabbath. Bu t 
they were very, very lovely pe
ople. They helped me. In fact 
they Œ they took me to buy 
me the first suit. You know, they were th
e new manufact Œ in those days th-things 
were still o n  ration, so to 
speak, you know there was a 
Œ nothing was 
Œ you couldn™t 
buy a shirt there Œ a shirt, or suits. They to
ok me to a suit manufacturer and bought me 
a Œ bought me a suit, shirt, tie. 
Then they took 
the la Œ Mrs. 
Birman
(ph) to ok me next 
day to 
Ma cy ™s
 and bought me a pair of shoes. An
d I took my  unifo rm, of course home, 
my army uniform. 
Q: So, I™m trying to imagine, here 
you are, you™ve just come over from 
Europe
, from 
Auschwitz
, a-agreed wi Œ with the 
period of time with these 
G.I.s
 an d you get on your 
first plane in your life and you come to 
New York
, one of the largest cities in the 
world, I think it was th
e largest at the time. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
32
A: Mm. 
Q: And Œ and all of a sudden  you™re on 
the subway . Had you been in a subway ? 
A: Never. Never.  
Q: It just se ems l ike Œ 
A: Never been on a Œ never be
en  on a bus, let alone a subway
. I was in Œ in Jeeps, and 
I was in trucks, in 
G.I.
 trucks. That Œ that I drove. Mo torcycles the 
G.I.s
 used to steal 
from the Germans. But th
en, never on a subway. 
Q: I know it™s 50 years a Œ 

A: All I had on me Œ all I had with me was my  unifo rm, my  duffle bag and my  field 

bag. Do  you know what a field 
bag is like? A carry on bag to 
[indecipherable]
 you 
would call it today.  

Q: I know it™s 50 years ago, but do you reme
mb er anything of that
 day and what it was 
like to see 
New York
, and Œ 
A: I™ll tell you something, I was gazing up in
 the sky. I never forg
et when the guy put 
me on the subways tres Œ train, and he told  me what station to  get off, you know, 

watch for th e station. And I 
asked people next to me, c
ould you help me with the 

station? And that™s how I 
got off. And then I got to 
Brooklyn,
 now I gotta walk up the 
steps from the k Œ from the Œ fro
m the subway to the street
. Now what™s Œ that™s not 
too hard because it was all wr
itten, you know, there™s a Œ th
e streets were marked. And 
that wasn™t too Œ too hard, 
but what was the hardest pa
rt, Saturday evening after 
Sabbath, the 
Birman
(ph) boys and their wives, they 
were older than I, took me for a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
33
ride to 
Manhattan
 to buy a newspaper. They  wanted to go to 
Ma nh a t ta n ,
 to sh ow me 
Manhattan. 
I never seen anything like it. I™ve ne
ver seen so many tall buildings. My li 
Œ my  Œ was scratching my  Œ stretching my  
neck like a giraffe, you know, that™s all I 
was looking at. And next day, Su
nday, they  had a summer home in 
New Jersey
 on the 
le Œ on th e lake, so they  took me ther
e. So that was my introduction to 
United States
.  
Q: How long did you stay with them? 
A: A little Œ little over a week. In fact, they we
re talking maybe I can work for them in 
the Œ in the fur factory as a runner, as a you 
know, th Œ gopher, y
ou know. But my  aunt 
insisted I, after all, I™m her brother™s son. So I went to 
Detroit
 by Œ by train, by train. 
Q: Now, you™d been 
on trains, obviously. 
A: On trains, yes. On trains in 
France
, I mean, in the army. Yeah
, I been in trains in 
Slovakia
 too . 
Q: Mm-hm. So you took a train to see 
her, she met you at the train station. 
A: She met me at a train station, yes. 
Q: Now, you™d never met her, obviously? 

A: Oh, I met my aunt in Œ 

Q: Oh, that™s right, before ™39, yeah. 
A: Before ™39, yes, I met my aunt and my
 uncle. She was the only one that survived 
because she is the wa Œ only 
one that ran away. In fact, we have a letter here at home, 
a number of letters from her and to her, what
 we used to write, 
my  parents and kid Œ 
all the kids used to add a line or two. My au
nt asked to Œ my  mo ther asked my  aunt to 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
34
take Œ take me with them when  they left for ya Œ for the 
Sta tes. 
My father wouldn™t let 
us Œ la Œ la Œ wouldn™t even hear of it. He
 felt it™s going to  go over, nothing is gonna 
happen to us.  
Q: What was it like to reunite this
 Œ she was now your only relative? 
A: Only relative, yes, and her Œ and her so
n. She had a little baby 
boy three years old. 
Q: What was that like? Was that just Œ 
A: Well, you know, I wish I could explain that feeling. I Œ of course it was emotional 
to her, you know, but me, it™s a Œ you know
, I been by my self for so many years, you 
know, this is Œ so I came to her ap Œ shehad an apartment, she gave me a little small 
room with a 
Murphy
 bed in it, and I really don™t know
 ho-how to explain th at feeling, 
it was Œ it was kind of strange feeling, here
 I am from th e camps, from the army, into 
civilization. Didn™t know ho
w to cope with  it. I had a hard time coping with it. 
Q: H-How would th at manifest itself? What
 Œ what did you Œ you had a hard time 
coping, how would th
at play itself out? 
A: Well, as soon as I got a job I kind of re
adju sted because I got busy with Œ with my  
work . No w I™m going to tell you how Œ in teres
ting how I got the job. Fo reign speaking 

salesman wanted, that™s 
how I got the job. Mr. 
Zo l c a r
(ph), the boss was in th Œ five 
foot man. He had tw o sons wo rking fo r him 
in the store and a son-in-law, and me, plus 
a few other people and the manager of the store, whose name was 
Joe Zwartney
(ph). 
And wh en I got there the old man looks at 
me  and speaks with a Yiddish accent, he 
said, are you a salesman? I told him I just came to 
America
 a few days ago. And asked 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
35
me what languages you speak? I tell him. He
 said, go in th e shipping room Œ the stock 
room, see 
Joe Zwartney
(ph). 
Zw a r t n e y
(ph) spoke a numb er of languages, American 
born Po le, Polish guy. He spoke Yiddish, he
 spoke Polish, he spoke Hungarian , he had 
all the languages, because that Œ that was a store. And the old man didn™t tell me I™m 

going to  pay you six dollars, or seven dollars 
or whatever, he didn™t tell me how much 
he™s going to  pay me. This is Monday mo rni
ng, Saturday  is payd
ay and everybody got 
paid in a small envelope, cash. He gave me
 56 dollars, my first week™s pay. That™s a 
lot of money in 1946. So I st
ayed with him for almost 
six years and I learned the 
business, then I became a shoe 
buyer, that™s how I knew the 
New England
 shoe 
companies. And I stayed with
 him until six years, then I 
went to work for another 
comp any, and I ended up with 
the comp any I mentioned called 
Shopper™s Fair. 
 
Q: How long were you in 
Detroit
 before you met your wife? 
A: A little Œ my wife got there in March 1947. 
Q: Oh, I see. So you were there for Œ 
A: I was there from M ay 10
th
, 1946 until March 1947
 before I met her. 
Q: Tell me about what life was lik e for you 
in that period. Other than work, what 
would you do? What did 
you do with yourself?  
A: Well, I played so ccer. I went to the Je
wish  Co mmu nity  Cen te
r. I met with people 
like myself, other survivors. We became Œ we
 were called the new 
Americans. We had 
meetings. We had people that would do mu
sic, you know, all sorts of mu sic and we 
had people that were interested in our 
life stories. There was a guy who owned a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
36
supermarket chain, a Jewish person who 
was a Œ quite a philanthropist. He hired a 
number of us Œ not me, but he
 hired a number of the boys to work  on supermarkets. 
Some of them he made managers i-in there Œ 
in Œ in there Œ in s -- in some time, as Œ 
as soon as they learned the tricks of the trade,
 so to speak. So we Œ we kind of kept to 
ourselves, because Œ you know 
what they used to calls us
? Greeners. Greeners mean 
green people. 
Q: New. 
A: New people, and greenhorns. They
 call us greenhorns. In Yiddish  
griners
(ph). And 
that™s how we kept going. Socce
r was really helpful to me. It
 got all the anxiety out of 
you, the nervousness out of you. You kick ed  the ball you were kicking the Germans, 

you know, an-and that type of
 th ing. So  Œ and of course I met some good people in 
soccer too, some of the old time German
s who came here before us. One was the 
Metropolitan Life Insurance salesman, he™s on 
the picture with Œ on 
th Œ on the soccer 
team with us, he was our manager. And ev
ery person who played  for him bought his Œ 
bought the policies, and that was his busin ess.  
Q: Did you, when you were 
wi Œ togeth er with these other survivors that you were 
socializing with and playing soccer with, 
did you talk about yo
ur experiences mu ch 
with th Œ 

A: Among ourselves, yes. Amon
g ourselves we used to. Yo
u know, we didn't believe 
ourselves that we still were free yet, you 
know, we were still, you remember w h at 
happened there, you remember
 w h at happened here. And 
rememb e r  wh en  yo u wo rk ed  

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
37
over there and you did over there, a
nd then  Œ and that type of Œ oh, 
Auschwitz
 always 
came up. See, because we were one of the fi
rst ones in this country, and some of us 
were old time survivors. You had some 
Polish Jewish boys there who not only 
suffered in 
Auschwitz
, but suffered before 
Auschwitz
. They suffered in 
Wa rsa w
 
ghetto and 
Bialysto k
 ghetto, 
Lódz
 ghetto. So these guys, from ™41 on had a Œ a hell of 
a tough time with their Œ in their lives, lost
 all Œ everybody Œ I 
don™t remember anyone 
of these boys who played on th
e soccer team that came with a sibling or a parent. Lone 
survivors. Yeah, one of them
 did. One had a brother, yeah. And he is on the Œ th ey™re 
both on the team with us. 
Q: Did you find that you were
 any mo re or less comfortable in their company than 
with other Œ 

A: No, because I soon becam
e friendly with American Œ 
American boys. I met two 
brothers, two Jewish boys, you know, 
Fleischer
(ph) boys. Their name is Œ last name is 
Fleischer
(ph), 
Matt
 and 
Ben Fleischer
(ph). And both of them 
were in armed servi Œ 
one was in the army, one was in the navy during World War II, and we became quite 

friendly. And I-I st Œ I started to break away
 from that group and started to find more 
American friends. Soon my wife and I Œ of
 course we be Œ we did belong to  the 
newcomer club, that Œ that we did, that 
we joined. It was a Œ it was a club that you 
joined and then it was all survivors. Or 
survivors married non-surv ivors. You know, 
like one girl married an American, the other 
Œ the other boy married an American girl, 
you know, that was Œ that ca 
Œ that type of a mixture. I-I-In the 40™s, you know, the 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
38
shidduch Œ
 the Œ the Œ the Œ the matchmakers 
was Œ was Œ was Œ the still Œ still in 
action among th e Jewish crowds, among th e Je
wish parents. You know, they  would 
ask who are you, wh at are you,
 how old are you? Boy, have
 I got a daughter for you. 
You know, that type of stor
y, see? So with me, it didn™t 
work that way. I was going 
with another girl before I met 
Agnes.
 I shouldn™t say it so loud. And all this girl 
wanted to  do was get married. And anythi
ng and anything Œ an
ything goes, but she 
wants to get married. And my  aunt was in 
love with the girl. Sh
e thought she was the 
greatest thing for me. But I fo
und out soon that she was 
not for me, and when I met 
Agnes, 
see. So Œ 
Q: Tell me about meeting your wife. 
A: It™s a very interesting meeting, actually
. As I told you, there was a school at the 
Jewish Community Center what was teachi
ng newcomers English. But we also had 
meetings there with the Œ w
ith the soccer team, the Jewish
 soccer team, these were 
called the 
Maccabees
. And I would go to  t Œ Thursday 
was our meetings and Thursday  
was their school. So  every time you went to
 the meeting, after the meeting I would 
walk into  the class Œ I knew the teacher, to look to  see if there are new girls in the 
class. Well, here I see this
 young, good looking lady, 
Agnes
, with another man who 
came with her, also a survivor and he wa
lked her, it was Œ it was a walking distance 

from the me Œ it wasn™t that far, maybe a m
ile walk. And I starte
d walking with them. 
And being an old Americ
an already, almost a year, I took them to 
Saunder™s. 
Saunder™s
 was a ice cream and Œ a
nd confectionary  place where you could buy cakes, 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
39
ice cream. Being a hotshot I knew what to 
buy, ap-apple pie and ice cream, you know, 
and coffee. And then I walked them home, a
nd I got Œ kind of pushed  this guy aside, 
and before you knew it, we 
started dating. We dated fro
m I would say end of March 
™47, and then the following year, Fe
bruary, we got married. February 22
nd
. And th e 
wedding was in a house, 
Agnes™s 
aunt™s and uncle™s house.
 Wer Œ we got married by 
the same rabbi who married 
Agnes™s 
parents in 
Hungary
. Name was 
[indecipherable] 
and he married us. Gypsy mu sic 
playing, because these were 
Hungarian Jews, Gypsy mu sic they brought,
 playing and Œ you know. And, a nice Œ 
nice affair, la Œ home Œ home Œ home in the house. 
Hippa
(ph) and th Œ you know, the 
canopy. And one of my  friends was my  be
st man, an American boy who became Œ was 
my best friend. So that™s how
 we met and we got married.  
Q: I want to slightly move your mike stand to just Œ 
A: Li Œ blocking you? 
Q: No, no, it™s just Œ it turn
s out that it™s better for you 
[indeciphera ble]
 hear, because 
if you™re looking at me, it™s closer to the ma
rk. You™ve told me that living with your 
aunt, that she was not interested in
 talking about what had happened Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ that she was very mu ch, you know Œ 
A: Well, she was afraid of it. She was actually
 afraid of it, she didn't want to talk about 
it. My aunt had some psychological problem
s, I think. We found out mu ch later she 
had 
Alzheimer™s. 
But she never wanted to  talk abou
t it. She had a only child. After 18 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
40
years of being married, the kid was born. They
 didn't want to have any ch ildren in sh Œ 
in 
Austria
, so they came here and it took them
 a long time before they had the child. 
And now is no Œ he is now in 
his 50™s. He was Œ he was thre
e years old in 1946, so in 
his 50™s. Wh at is Œ what is he? How old is he? 
Q: He would be 50 fi Œ 55.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is he Œ is that your only relative? 
A: That™s all, yes, mm-hm, my first 
cousin. Very prominent attorney in 
Cincinnati, 
one of the largest law fi
rms, and not only in 
Cincinnati 
but all over the wor Œ all over 
the Œ they have some in 
Europe
, in Œ in 
Asia
 they got law offices. And he is a Œ he 
was the first Jewish boy hired by this law firm. It was 
T a ft, 
with one of the 
Taft
 
family, and 
Hollister
 and as Œ an d it™s a huge, huge law firm. And he™s now a partner 
there for last, I would say 15 Œ 20 years. The 
first Jew to become a partner of a Œ of a 
very kind of Christians Œ 
for Ch ristian organization.

same Œ he follows the same pattern as his pa
rents did, one sin, one
 son, one boy. And 
he™s now just graduated one of the big colle
ges in the east, and he spent some time in
 
England
. He™s back home now, taking so me time 
out to go to grad school. And I™m 
quite close with him. He does look like my
 father and his son 
does also look like my  
father. And Œ red hair like my father had, fire
 red hair and a very 
bright, bright, bright 
guy. My  children love him, you know. He co
mes Œ Thanksgiving is never without him. 
In fact, he™s very upset with me, I was suppos
ed to be there last weekend. He wants us 
over there so we™ll Œ we™ll see if Œ if I can
 get away from soccer th
is weekend,we™ll go 
over there. 

Q: Tell me about your anger, either contempora
ry or previous. I mean, over the past 50 
odd years since the war ende
d, have you been  angry an
d Œ and wh ere does your Œ 
where do you direct that? 
A: Well, I don™t know if you can ca
ll it anger. I call it resentment.  
Q: Okay . 

A: Resenting that about myself, that I don™t have anyone Œ anyone from my  immediate 

family in the Œ close to me. I had a brothe
r who was a strong, feisty young man, young 
boy. He was mu rdered weeks after he wa Œ was taken away by the Nazis. I had a

sister, you™ve seen her picture, pr
etty strong girl, another one who 
[indeciphera ble]
. 
My father, a strong cattle and horse dealer, w
ho fell to the Nazis like Œ like this. So my 
anger is, why me and why not them? At least, 
why not me with them? This is wa Œ this 
is what it is. There are times I feel so lone
ly about it, so loneso me, yet I am so close 
with my children. This is all I have, my 
children, my  grandchildren. But I™m mi ssing 
the mo st important thing in my  life. If you can call it anger, that™s anger. But I resent, I 

f Œ I say why it had to happen to  me? 
Q: Do you Œ is it Œ is your
 anger at God? Is it Œ 
A: God? I have a problem with God. I have
 an argument with God. Of course, he 
doesn ™t answer me. I n ever lost the identity 
where I came from. Never lost that I was 
born to a Jewish family. I was born to a G
od fearing Jewish family in easter Œ in 
Euro pe
, in ch Œ in 
Slovakia
. In fact, I was quite religious, for a number of years. 
When I got to 
Auschwitz
 I still had belief in religion, a 
belief in God, but I soon lost 
that. If God wanted to punish us Jews, if we
 did something th at te
rribly wrong, punish 
us for a day, a week or three da Œ wh
atever. But let us 
suffer from 1939 in 
Slovakia
, in 
Poland
, in 
Ukraine,
 in all the other European co
untries, from 1939 til 1945, let us 
being systematically murder
ed, thrown in to the ovens. And me, working th e ga Œ 
work ing that railroad tracks, and seeing that
 with my own eyes, 
knowing what these 
mass of thousands upon thousan ds of peop
le were being herded  like sheep, not 
knowing where they™re going, I have an anger 
with God. I have a problem with God. If 
it wouldn™t be for 
Ag nes
, I probably would never stepped in a temp le, my  foot in a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
43
temp le. She says, we have children, we have 
to do something. We have to let them Œ 
let them do, and then when th
ey get older let them Œ let them lead their own way, but 
teach Œ show them the way first. Well, we 
did that. Our son was Bar Mitzvah, our little 
Œ our young Œ oldest daughter was Bat Mitz
vahed, the other two weren™t. But I still 
when I go to the temple I 
feel like Œ like a hypocrite. Where was God for three years, 
letting this happen, the systematic
 destruction of every Jew in 
Europe?
 That™s my 
anger with  God. You know, in Yiddish
 there Œ I Œ I Œ there™s a saying, 
Ehob tsores 
wich hemas borach  
(ph). I™ve got troubles with God, problems with God. Where were 
you Œ wh -when Œ where were
 you? There™s some time I™m speak to a group of 
Christian church es, some Œ some guy came up 
to me after the questions and he™s Œ he 
Œ he may 
[indeciphera ble]
 wh ile Œ wh ile I was answering the question he cames up to 
the Œ to the microphone and he
 says, but you Jews were th
e chosen people. So  I, being 
a sarcastic with a sick sense of humor, we
ll why didn™t God choose somebody else for 
this? Why were we chosen to 
be burned and gassed? So th-t
h-this is my  anger. I don™t 
have an ounce of hate in me. Anger is not ha
te, because if you hate, you die inside. I™m 
angry because this happened , and I™m 
angry because I™m the only one from my  

immediate family. Wouldn™t that be wonde
rful if my  brother would Œ could see his 
nieces and nephews be
ing a success?  
Q: Were you ever suicidal? 

A: Pardon? 
Q: Were you ever suicidal? 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
44
A: Suicidal? No. No. In 
Auschwitz
, yes, I thought about it, but outside of 
Auschwitz
, 
never. When I married and started to see my ch
ildren, I said here is my life. This is 
what I want to live for. In 
Auschwitz
 I was this close from runni
ng to  the fence, to the 
electric fence. 
Q: A lot of people did th at. 

A: I had typhus. 1943, I had typhus in 
Auschwitz
, and I thought for sure that™s the end 

of me. When you have typhoid fever in 
Auschwitz
, your equilibrium, you lose that, 
you lose hearing, totally. You don™t hear. An
d if it wouldn™t be for 
two guys that saved 
my life in 
Kanada
 commando wh ere I was work ing Œ under my  ar Œ under my  arms 
they would drag me through 
the gates. When I got to 
Kana da  
commando, in a pile of 
clothes they would cover me 
up and bring me some water, hot
 water to drink, with Œ 
with lemo n if they could find it among th e pa
ckages that the Jews
 brought with them. 
And that™s how they Œ that™s 
how th ey helped  me come out 
of it. If they would left me 
in the barracks, I would have been  in the ove
ns. And that™s when I 
wanted to  walk to 
the wires, and th ey stopped me. Unfortunately 
both of them died al
ready. One died in 
New York
 and one died in 
Slovakia
. 
Q: You say you don™t have an ounce of hate 
in you. Who do you Œ 
outside of having a 
problem with God th at you™ve talked ab out,
 ha-have you struggle
d with who to blame 
for what happened? 

A: The world. The world looked  the othe
r way. You know, we never believed that 
anyone knew about us. We never believed in 
Auschwitz
 that anybody 
knew what was 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
45
going on because if somebody would be
lieve, somebody would do something. 
Somebody would stop. When  I got out of 
Auschwitz
, it took many years to find out 
wh-w ho knew and who didn™t know. 
United States
 knew in 1942 th at there were Jews 
being murdered in th Œ in th
 Œ in Œ in the camp
s. They  didn't have all the details, but 
they knew . How did I find out? Th
rough documentaries,  t h rough 
Shoah. Jan Karski
, 
professor at Œ in 
Wa shington
, 
Georgeto wn  Univ ersity
. He was a Polish courier, he 
came to this country , came to 
England
, came to 
Switzerland
. He was talking to these 
people, to Œ to th
e presidents, the 
Churchill
 and no one wanted to  do Œ they  knew, 
they believed, but didn™t do anyt
hing about it. In my stay at 
Auschwitz
, on two 
occasion the international 
Red Cross came. Once in 
Auschwitz
 one, and then  in 
Birkenau
 the following year. Not one time did th
e Nazis let them in to the barracks. 
We were all lined up in a roll call place, st
an ding sc Œ clean, with
 clean uniforms. They 
cleaned up the camp. You kno w what the cleaned up camp
 meant? They took all the 
prisoners who were looking like skeletons, 
or half skeletons, got them away from 
there, right in the ovens. Showered us, so  you can call the showers. Gave us clean 
stripes. And they would bring fo rward Œ th ey
 would talk to Œ they  would put the best 
looking guys forward, standing forward, an
d they would let them
 talk to somebody. 
How are you treated? Oh fine, everything 
is great. Course, if you didn™t say that 

[indecipherable]
 Red Cross leaves and you know wh
at™s going to  happen to you. The 
camp was swept clean there a Œ the Œ the Œ the 
Œ this Œ the grounds. That™s how it was. 
So who do you blame? You blame the 
world, knowing and not listening.  

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
46
Q: You know it™s Œ to me 
it™s interesting, because I didn™t experience what you 
experienced, that everyone I™ve spoken to, and everyone I™ve 
Œ whose memo irs I™ve 
read or anything, directs their anger there, at
 the peep Œ at the rest
 of the world who s Œ 
who sat back and Œ an d didn™t do anything, ra
ther than at the people who did do things, 
meaning at the people at the Œ 

A: Well, let me put you to the people who 
did their things, okay? You see, I blame the 
world for not stopping the people who did it 
to us. That™s Œ that™s the first ones to 
blame. Now, let™s go to the people that di
d it to us. Who did it to us? Not just the 
German Nazi 
SS
, but the Slovakian Nazi guards
, the Croatian Nazi guards, the 
Romanian Nazi guards, the Hu
ngarian Nazi guards. These were all part of it. You 
know, I had at 
Auschwitz
 a number of guar Œ Croatian guard s who had 
SS 
uniforms 
on, who were our guar
ds. And these were the animals,
 these were the killers. T h ey 
were bigger killers in Œ in a way sometim
es than the Nazi Germans killers. I h ave 
testified since 1982. ™82 - ™90 - ™91 - ™92 - ™9
3, against Nazis, former Nazi aw Œ guards 
and officers at 
Auschwitz
. Out of those, three of them
 were not Germans. One was a 
Latvian, the one who elected to be deport
ed. The other one, in 1990 I testified in 
Honolu lu
 was a Yugoslavian. One in September I 
gave deposition on, two year Œ three 
Œ two years ago, a Slovak, from my count
ry , and the other guy was a German.  

Q: So clearly it was not only th
e Germans, I mean this is Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
47
A: Well, my own to wn, who picked  me up, who picked  up my  family? Ou r owe Œ our 
barber. Our family barber, his name was 
Martinchek
(ph). This the guy who picked us 
up. 
Q: Let me ask you a question. I™m embarrassed
 to say I can™t remember th-the name of 
the author, but you™ll know imme diately the 
book I™m talking about
, the book that has 
been such  a controversy in
 the past few years, the 
Harv ard
 professor Œ 
A: Yeah, 
ﬁHitler™s W illing Executioners.ﬂ 
Q: What did you think of that? 

A: I think it™s one of the best piece of wo
rk ever done. Unfortunately it™s written in Œ 
in such a high co llege terms, 
cause this guy is an educator
, he™s Œ he did his thesis on 
that, that it™s Œ it Œ you have to read it tw
ice to understand it, for the average person. 

But this man did something that was gutsy, th
at was plain, plain gutsy. He finally said 
something th at we as survivors hoped so
mebody would say. It was the average 
German, the average person. It was not the 
hierarchy of th e Nazis who did th is, it was 
every German on the street 
that did this. This was 
Hitler™s 
willing executioner. And 
you couldn™t get a better title in that in a bo
ok. It™s th-the Œ the 
writer who wrote it, his 
name is 
Goldhagen. 
I™ve got the book
, by the way. 
Q: But would you add to that th-the Slovak 
on the street, the Croatian on the street, the 
Œ 

A: I would add ev ery memb er 
of the Slovakian commu nity on 
the street for the simple 
reason, why did the Slovak did it here? The Na
zis told them, get rid of the Jews, you 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
48
know wh at™s gonna happen? You™re going to
 get their businesses, you™re going to get 
their homes, you™re going to  get their m
onies. Now they  got greed and Œ and an ti-
Semitism they had to begin w
ith. They need Œ th
ey didn™t need Œ they didn™t need 
much pushing and sh oving. Th
e Œ wh-who put me in the ca
ttle cars? Wasn™t the Nazis. 
I never seen a Nazi put me in the cattle 
car. Was Œ was the Slov
ak guards who, with 
his wife Œ with his rifle butts and Œ and ba
yonets that start stic
king into you, shoving 
you into the cattle cars. Goodbye Jews. These 
were their famous words, they were the 
Œ they would all say goodbye Jews, good ri
ddance. The guy who took my father™s 
business became a Nazi. This Œ this 
[indecipherable]
 
Martinchek
(ph) who was a 
barber, he to ok another guy™s name, 
Benow
(ph), 
Desdair
(ph) 
Benow™s
(ph) busin ess, 
he Œ he work ed fo r him before
, now he™s got his busin ess. He put him in the oven Œ in-
into the Œ into the cattle car
s. So these were there. 
Neilosh
(ph) in  
Hungary
, the same 
type of Nazis, and 
Romania
 had them. 
Yugoslavia 
had all the Croats. 
Franjo 
Trudman
, th-the president of
 Croatia
 i-is a big shot. He was invited to come to the 
opening of the Holo caust Museum, I almo st
 died, I almost Œ almost Œ pardon the 
expression, threw up when I™v
e seen him. Here comes a Croatian, I don™t care how 
young he is, but his father was a Nazi and 
so is he and they™re bringing him to the 
opening of the Holo caust Museum in 
Washington. 
He had no business there. He 
certainly was not a Righteous Gentile. These 
were the Œ these were the Œ these were 
the 
Hitler™s 
willing executioner, not only in 
Germany
,
 
but in 
Poland
, in 
Ukraine
, in 
Slovakia.
 Every eur Œ Nazi Europ
ean country wa-wa Œ wa Œ 
these people collaborated

with the Nazis. 
Slovakia
 became a fascist country . We had a presid ent, who was he? 
Josef Tiso, 
a Catholic pis Œ a priest. Very close to my  hometown, that™s where he 
came from. Anti-Semite. Je
ws the Christ killers. 
Q: But you say 
you don™t hate? 
A: No. No. In spite of all that
, I d on™t hate. But what I wa Œ 
what I say is this, when the 
trial is begun, and I™m not talking about th
e trials one by one, I™m talking Œ th e biggest 
farce were the 
Nuremberg 
trials. They brought a few of th
ese bigwigs into the trial, pe 
Œ few of them, 
nicht schuldig
, not guilty, hm? Well, my dear friend, where was the 
rest of the world, of the Nazi world, that
 wasn™t tried? What happened to th e Nazi 
guard s, to the Nazi officers who ran thes
e over a hundred  concentration camp s and 
death camps? Where are they? Living the life of 
Riley
, if they™re still alive today, 
which mo  Œ a lot of them are. What happe
ned to them? Absolute
ly nothing. In the 
Soviet prison they were mistreated, were
 beaten, sometimes they were starved, 
whatever, big deal. By the Am
ericans? A slap on the wris
t, two months in prison, 
released, go back  home. Nothing happened  to
 them. They were never on trial. These 
were the killers, these were 
Œ they should have been on
 trial. The-These few people 
they had lined up the 
Nuremberg
 trials, the few hotshots, th
e few Nazi leaders, that™s 
nothing. They did nothing. 
United States
 should be ashamed fo
r even pe-performing 
that trial over there. That was an Œ absolute
ly a farce, nothing to
 it. The words of my 
captain, 
Chesskey
(ph), we didn™t come here to make a concentration camp, we came 
here to bring demo cracy. Beautiful, bri
ng demo cracy. Bu t punish the animals who 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
50
were killing my father and my mother an
d my sister and my 
brother. Nothing was 
punished , nothing was done.  
Q: Do you think that if all 
of the guards and all of the Œ 
the people who were in charge 
at 
Auschwitz
, the people that killed your family, if
 they were all executed, would you 
feel better? 

A: Not Œ they don™t have to
 execute them. Don™t have to execute them. Bring them on 
trial, and bring the survivors to be witnesses.
 Bring th e survivors to force these guys to 
tell their life stories, what they did. Yo
u know, I testified against a guy named ha Œ 
Hanscun
(ph )
 Œ Heinrich Hans Kunneman
(ph) in  
Germany
, in
 Du ssberg, Germany 
in ™91 - ™92 and ™93, three times. Actually 
five times, b ecause two times here, also, you 
know, at the Œ at the German Œ 
at the German consulates in 
Chicago
 and 
Detroit
. Here 
is a man who was in charge of Œ of th
e counter-comma ndo, one of the counter-
commando pris Œ Nazis, in front of my eyes
 murdered a little boy about six years old. 
How did he mu rder him? We were unloa
ding a transport of Jews coming into 
Auschwitz
. This little boy is sitting in
side a cattle car crying. 
Ha n s Kunneman
(ph) ha 
Œ his name is 
Heinrich, Hans Kunneman
(ph) tells me, go pick 
up that Jew. Pick up 
the little boy, set him down, kid is still crying. 
Kunneman
(ph) walks by the kid 
because he starts to stop him from crying. W
ith his boot he kicks the kid in the head 
and kills him right there on the spot. Little, little
 shaver, little kid. Ta 
Œ tells me to pick 
up the sack of Jewish shit a
nd Œ and bring him to the rest
 of the people. There I am 
carrying the limp body of his little boy. 
Ha ns Kunnema n
(ph) was then already 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
51
training to be an opera singer, okay? As 
he walks away from 
killing the je Œ little 
Jewish boy, he is whistling an operatic t
une. Singing and wh istli
ng an operatic tune 
like nothing happened. 90 Œ in 1990 I got a call from 
Germany 
from a prosecutor. I™ve 
got your name from su ch and such person, 
would you be willing to
 give us a testimony 
agains Œ against a former Nazi. Didn™t
 tell me who. Course we meet in 
Chicago
 at the 
ger Œ German consulate Œ the German consulate on 
M i ch iga n  A v en u e
, so when? It™s 
like day after Thanksgiving
. So I go over there for 
Chicago
, they bought me a flight 
ticket or whatever, I™m in a hotel and I get th
ere. I testify all day, from nine o™clock in 
the morning to break for lunch, til six o™cloc
k in the evening. He 
opens up a book of 
photographs then, not today, then  photographs with the uniforms and everything on. 
Identify this man on three different photog
raphs, plus three other Nazis who also 
work ed in  the same position. Then  I was taken to 
Germany
 following su mmer with 
my wife. Identified them over there just as easy. This a Œ this 
was a tribunal. Eight 
judge tribunal, not a Œ not a 
Œ a Œ a jury trial. I had a 
interpreter, and the Œ and the 
German attorney sitting next to me. There was 
Kunneman
(ph) sitting, he
 had a court 
appointed doctor with him, he
 claimed to be very sick, and these eight judges. And I™m 
testifying and testifying. And I was asked, 
the third time I testif
ied, what would you 
like that should happen, you know, cause othe
rwi Œ I knew I testi Œ because th ere was 
other people testifying. But they  brought 17
 guys to testify against him. 17 former 
prisoners. Not one of us meet
 each other Œ met each other. You came on the Saturday , 
stayed for three days and then
 you went to court, then you
 left, then the other guys 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
52
came on a Saturday. One guy at a time. So
 I was asked by one of the judges, how 
would I Œ what would Œ wh at would I feel 
that should happen here? After all, with 
your testimony the man should be sentenced.
 Well, I said, I really don™t care if you 
sentence him. I just want one thing from y
ou people. If this man will be willing to do 
what I™m doing. I speak about my experien
ces as a Holocaust 
survivor. I go to 
colleges, universities, high sc
hools, civic, religious orga
nizations. Let him come with 
me. Let him tell his Œ his st
ory about what he did in 
Auschwitz
 for the 18 months that 
I knew him on the ramp s. For the 18 months th at
 he would direct people, select people 
to the gas chambers or to slave labor. Let 
him tell what he did and I™ll tell mals Œ my 
story. The two of us together. That would 
be enough of a sentence for me. And that™s 
the kind of sentence I was hoping the masses 
of the Nazis would get. The masses, in 
every German community. They
 should be taken to co
urt with so Œ Holocaust 
survivors to be there and talk about it and te
ll them and force them to Œ to admit that 
not I followed orders like Œ like I was to
ld, to do Œ what to 
do, I only Œ even 
Eichmann
 in 1961, what he said
 in Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Israel
? I followed orders. Well, tell 
me why did you followed orders? You tell th
is to your community, in front of a 
survivor who is mentally and p
hysically able to testify. Th
at is what I am saying them 
Œ should happen to the masses. Not once of all 
these times I testifie
d did I walk  out of 
the courtrooms with a lighter heart, just 
satisfied that something was done, because 
there wasn™t. One damn Nazi in 
Honolulu
 called me a liar. He was being tried, he 
called me a liar. He admitted being on the 
railroad tracks. He ad
mitted walking and 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
53
marching prisoners from and to slave labor. An
d that™s what I told, he was a killer and 
he calls me a liar. And what happ
ened to him? He was deported to  
Germany
. Big 
deal. I was told that ther
e will be a trial again in 
Germany
, you will be called. This 
was seven years ago. 
Q: I was just thinking of Œ I don™t mean to
 make a na Œ a direct analogy but I know 
that there are like drunken driv
ers who have killed people, wh
o go talk to children in 
schools and say, you know, this is where this led me, this is what I did. Learn from me. 
Do you think th at if Œ if th
ese guards and officers and Œ were
 to do what you™re talking 
about, that it would have mu ch of an impact on Œ 
A: On the civilization, or on me? 
Q: On civilization. 
A: Yes, it would have mu ch impact beca
use you see, Holocaust became fashionable 

the last number of years. It wasn™t fashiona
ble as soon as we got out of there. Took Œ 
you know, it took
 Meryl Streep
, with the worst piece of dr
ecky work, worst piece of 
crappy film, called, ﬁ
The Holocaust
,ﬂ or whatever y-you Œ 
yeah, it™s called Œ was 
called ﬁ
The Holocaust.ﬂ
 It made her a star. It was the worst piece of junk that was 
ever produced in ho Œ it™s 
Hollywood
, you know, it™s a Œ it™s 
a Œ it™s a plastic. But 
what was good about it? That was Œ they 
had two, two things. On e, the wo rst film. 
Second, it had the best thing. It got the atte
ntion of the pub Œ the 
general public. Well, 
this is what the general public now wants t
oday. Ho locaust is a very fashionable thing, 
not only because of 
Spielberg, 
because of Shoah, and 
any Œ any piece of Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
54
documentary on Holocaust, true or not tr
ue Œ I-I shouldn™t say 
not true, accurate or 
almost inaccurate, it has so
me affect on people. Now, 
Anne F rank
 has an affect on 
people. These guys would ha
ve a big affect if they would go to co lleges and 
universities, schools and civic a
nd religious organizations. Oh
 yeah , lot of s Œ lot of 
our population wouldn™t want to hear that. 
They won™t listen to it. Not because they 
don™t want to hear, but because they d
on™t think it™s Œ that should be done. I-In 
Germany
 nobody wanted to do it. 
Listen, his book, hi Œ ﬁ
Hitler™s Willing 
Executionersﬂ
 was the biggest seller in 
Germany
. He drew more crowd in 
Germany
 
when  he was lecturing there, and there was boyc
otts there. Yet, this
 is what the people 
should hear. You know, pretty
 soon there won™t be any survivors left. We™re getting to 
be old people. Now, 
I™m not Œ I™m Œ I consider myself
 still one of the younger guys, 
but at the same time, every day you got 
less a nd less Œ there™s le ss a nd less of us 
around. 
A-A-Auschwitz
 will only be a legend. No w who™s gonna Œ other than the 
Holo caust Museum wh ich I™m doing today, 
which I did in 1989
 for the Holocaust 
Museum, who is going to be here? Just this
. There won™t be a living person to  be able 
to say things like I say, or like other surv
ivors who are capable of talking. So these 
guys should go out there and do that. And 
let me tell you, they would have a great 
audience. Very Œ there are so
 ma ny people that are hungry to  know why it happened, 
because ho Œ there are not that many of 
us that go to schools and colleges and 
universities. You know, some of us are gettin g 
so old that we Œ we Œ we fantasize. You 
know, some people fantasize and I get very
 upset with it, you know. If they don™t 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
55
remember what happened to
 th em, th-the-they say something different. And that™s 
what gets me very upset. And that even
 gots me u Œ gets me  upset with sp Œ 
Spielberg™s 
interviews. I will not be interviewed by 
Spielberg
, no way, no how. But 
let™s leave that alone. 
Q: Well, no, no, not really, because one of th
e things I was eventua
lly going to ask you 
is your critique of the books a
nd th e movies and the th ings that have come about in the 
past, really, mostly the past decade. 
A: Yeah, til 10 years. I mean, the bi Œ it 
wasn™t Œ well, it became fashion Œ the 
Holocaust became fashionable. I call it 
the fashionable time for the Holocaust. 
Q: So Œ so it™s Œ I don™t think it™s not german
e to this interview to
 your perspective as 
one who was there, about how you feel ab
out how it™s been documented, accurately, 
inaccurately, inappropriately, appropriately. 
In the Œ in the various ways that people 
have tried to do. So I Œ that was actua
lly something I was going to  ask you about. 
A: Well, anything done in 
Hollywood
, to  me, got me upset, including 
Simon 
Wiesenthal™s
 story, when he was Œ did some Œ 
Simon Wiesenthal 
did some stuff. 
And I™m Œ I™m very disturbed with 
Simon Wiesenthal™s
 presentation of the Œ of the 
television movies. It didn™t happen like th
at, number one and then  it™s a fantasizing 
there a little bit. I™ve seen
 these rubber blown up
 bodies being taken in 
Mauthausen
 
concen  Œ 
Mauthausen 
concen tration camp, which is wr
ong, totally wrong, you don™t 
do th ese things. You want to do something?
 Make a documentary. Docu mentary wh ich 
Œ wh ich you know how to do. The be
st ever film on Holo caust was ﬁ
The Shoah
.ﬂ The 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
56
eight and a half hour program by 
Lanzmann,
 th e Frenchman who did it. This was a 
piece of work that is the best. Other than th
at, I haven™t seen very li Œ I™ve seen very 
little that I would recommend. Oh yeah, th
e people will watch it Œ which I™m glad 
they™re watching, because it 
[indecipherable]
 gets the attention. But a 
Spielberg
 
movie? When I first found out that 
Steven Spielberg
 is going to make the 
Schindler 
stor Œ ﬁ
Schindler™s List
,ﬂ at first I was wondering. I sa
ys, here is a guy who is going 
to make a Holo caust movie. He is a man who made 
ﬁE.T,ﬂ 
what is he going to do with 
the Holo caust? You know, he™s got 
Indiana Jones
 and ﬁ
E.T.
ﬂ Well, when the Œ 
ﬁ
Schindler™s Listﬂ
 came to town, here to 
Indianapolis, 
I was invited as a Holocaust 
survivor to be there 
for special presentations, and I we
nt. Here comes the elite Jewish 
community of 
Indianapolis
, some of the elite guys, some of the big givers, what do 
you call, they come there. Everyone™s got a 
popcorn in  their Œ bag in their hand, puts 
their feet on Œ on Œ on the other seat and stre
tch themselves, I hope there™s a Œ there is 
a nice popcorn movie tos Œ to watch. So here
 I am listening, watching, and watching 
because 
[indecipherable]
 what Œ what this guy could do, what he did with it. And I 
walked out of there really al
most satisfied that he did 
a good job. If he™d shown any 
mo re atrocities than he show
ed  in the film, I don™t think 
people could have sit through 
it. Some of it was a little schmaltzy. I wa
s a little bit Œ you know, I watched it so 
closely. When 
Oskar Schindler 
said at the end, I should have done mo re, I should 
have done this, I should have that, I Œ I™d 
Œ I didn™t do enough, I should have saved 
more people, those words, well that was a li
ttle schmaltzy to me, you know. Th-That Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
57
that Œ that they could have left out. Yes, 
Oskar Schindler 
did help. There™s 5,000 
survivors of that group that are alive toda
y because of him. Y
ou know, 5,000 memb ers 
of the families that came la Œ after. So that Œ that™s Œ it was fairly Œ done fairly decent. 
But the other ones, I don™t remember
 of any other one, other than  
Sobibor, ﬁEscape 
From Sobibor,ﬂ
 I™m sorry, that was done because 
they fo und people that survived 
Sobibor
 and these were the people
 that helped, same as 
Oska r Schindler 
got th e Œ got 
the book from a Œ from a Œ from 
the luggage store in Œ in 
L.A.
 and here™s these guys 
from th Œ 
Lo ng  Isla nd, New Yo rk
 who were 
Sobibor 
su rvivors, they 
helped with the 
movie. Well, that was almost Œ pretty accura
te. But other than that, there is nothing. 
Abso lutely nothing. 
Kirk Douglas
 was in the movie one time, and I Œ I tell you 
something, I Œ I was going to 
go over there and kick th e hell out of him for that movie. 
But if Œ but you di Œ what it is, the American
 public. They eat it up. They listen to it, 
they want to know. See, I™d Œ I 
Œ I become like a Œ like Œ like a 
Mattel
 toy, somebody 
wind you up and you keep going. Because all of a su
dden they said, oh you Œ 
Holocaust? Call 
Mike Vogel
. All right, so th Œ 
Mike Vogel
, ah Œ wind you up, send 
you to th e school. You know, that type of
 stuff. I™ve got enough here to write a book 
just Œ just for the letters I™d received fro
m universities, colleges,
 civic and religious 
organizations, just Œ just the letters that 
they talk about my 
Œ my  being th ere.  
Q: Let me ask you a question. Because you™
ve done so mu ch public speaking and Œ 
and you™ve told your story so
 often, in Œ since that time when  your daughter, in eighth 
grade Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
58
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ wh en you went to her class Œ I don™t 
know how to  ask this question properly, and 
I mean no disrespect Œ 
A: Okay . 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Michael Vogel.
 This is tape number two, side
 B, 
and I was asking Mr. Vogel 
whether through repetition of telling your stor
y in all the many times that you™ve told 
it now, whether it has lost for you any Œ 
any connection to your emotions, or Œ 
A: It™s a very good question. You know, a
lthough the story is the same, it™s not the 
same. Like some Œ some Œ on many occasi
ons, many places, come s out Œ you know, 
starts out a little different. It depends. Lot 
of time I™m lo oking at the audience. I Œ the 
stories Œ I Œ I can™t change the stories, I can™
t exchange my  style of it, I Œ but I tell it, 
but sometime it™s much strong
er, or sometime it™s a little 
weaker, depending on the 
audience. But it™s not Œ I don™t feel it repetitio
us. I tell it from day one, before, during 
and after the Holocaust. And Œ an-and it™s not a 
routine. It always like a new story, if 
you know what I™m saying. And when  it beco
mes even more interesting, it depends on 
the audien ce, their questions. When  their 
questions come, and wh en  you talk to 
graduate students, when you ta
lk to clergy, when
 you talk to people that are really 
knowledgeable, that Œ that so
me are even scholars, a-and 
book writers, then it becomes 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
59
even more powerful. You gotta
 remember, when I™m speaking
 to high school students, 
I don™t get the same questions from high school
 kids that I get from a graduate student. 
So it becomes more powerful. 
And a lot of times it™s surpri
sing, some of these private 
schools, like high schools and ev en middle sc
hools, ask a better question than  some of 
the college students. 

Q: That™s what I was going to ask you, 
whether there™s exceptions that rule. 
A: Exception to that rule, yes.  
Q: Do you have any Œ 
I realize you™ve done this many 
times, but is there anything that 
jump s out at you, an anecdot
e of Œ you know, out of th
e mouths of babes, some 
insightful question that Œ 

A: I wish I could. 
Q: Here I am, I-I™ve gotten through a Œ a ti
ny bit of the questions that I Œ that Œ 
A: You got mo re to go? 
Q: This is terrible. I mean terrible only th
at I™m taking so mu ch of your time. There 
were a couple more. This is Œ I Œ I apologize for Œ  
A: Yeah, right, right. 

Q: Œ for not being better organized with this
, but there are a few more questions that 
they wanted me to ask you that still pertai
n to the video interview that there were a 

couple of holes in. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: They wanted me to ask you about the trans part from 
Auschwitz
. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
60
A: To? 
Q: Where you were going next. Was that Œ 

A: 
Sachsenhausen. 
Q: 
Sachsenhausen.
 Did you Œ did you know where you were going? 
A: No. When they 
uprooted us nighttime from the barracks, 
Kanada
 commando was 
dissolved already. There were
 no mo re transports coming in . This is October 1944. We 

thought for sure that 
they™re taking us to the gas ch
ambers because we™ve seen so 
much, number one. Of course 
we didn™t know that Œ we th
ought we were the last Jews 
alive to begin with. Now, here we go to th
e railroad tracks, and there are cattle cars 
waiting for us. And guards went with us, some 
of the guards went with us, only  up to 
the camp, and then that is the last time we
™ve seen them. We n Œ 
did not know wh at we 
going. Now we come to 
Sa chsenhausen
, and there is no room for us in 
Sach senhausen 
in the barracks, because there™s mo
re prisoners in Œ everybody is on 
the street of the camp, not
 knowing wh ere I Œ why and wh at. We find out from the 
other prisoners who came a little 
after us, that the Russians 
are already very close to 
pole Œ they are in 
Poland
 now. They could hear Œ hear 
the shots and that™s why th ey 
were taken away from there.
 So now we found out w
hy. And then , of course, 
Sach senhausen 
is very close to 
Berlin.
 The Americans and the British were bombing
 
Berlin 
like crazy. And yet, there 
were still killings.  
Q: Let me step back a little bit. 
A: All right. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
61
Q: That™s a r-reasonably long trip, isn™t it? 
A: I don™t rememb er exactly how many hours, but say it was Œ 
Auschwitz
 was close to 
border of Œ the Czech and Ge
rman border too. I would sa
y five, six, seven hours, 
maybe longer. 

Q: Oh okay, all right. What I was wondering  about and what they
 were asking about 
is. I ha Œ I realize you™d been  at 
Auschwitz
 for quite some time at
 Œ I mean you Œ wa Œ 
you Œ was Œ I™m trying to understand what it 
was like for you to be leaving and Œ and 
to be Œ have this uncertainty of wher
e you were going, and I mean, to jus Œ 
A: Well, we were like robots, it was Œ first of
 all, they don™t give you time to think, 
you couldn™t think. Among ou
rselves we would say, oh my
 God, wh ere we going? 
Among ourselves. Think they™re 
going to take us to kill us 
now? They Œ we figure they 
cleared some Œ some wooded area, shoot us 
and that™s the end of us. First we thought, 
if they make a left turn as we marching
, gas chambers. But they  didn™t make a left 
turn, where we going? Pe Œ cattle
 cars. Now we come to sa Œ 
Sachsenhausen
. We 
don™t know what we doing here. No more 
slave labor camp s, no mo re slave labor 
[indecipherable]
 no Œ no Œ no place to go. 
Q: Did you Œ we Œ were you talkin
g amongst yourselves in the car? 
A: Oh su re, sure Œ 

Q: Cause it seems like Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
62
A: Œ sc Œ I went with three of my friends
 who were my  partners. One had died in 
Israel, 
one died in 
Slovakia
. 
Sydler
(ph)
,
 you have Œ you got his name on Œ on the list 
there, misspelled. 
Q: That™s why the list is there, so  yo
u can afterwards spell them properly. 
A: Right.  
Q: How long did you spent in 
Sachsenhausen
? 
A: I would say couple weeks. 
Q: What was it like there, aside from bein
g crowded? Wh at Œ wh
at did you do, how Œ 
A: Was har-hardly any food. Nothing. Just wa
lked the camp and slep
t on the si Œ in the 
si Œ we didn™t sleep inside the barracks, we
 slept on th e Œ o-on the grounds. There was 
no room for us. Dogs and guard
s, people dying next to yo
u. All the Œ all you tried to 
do is to take off the Œ somebody™s 
jacket so you can be a little warmer. 
Q: So s Œ you said it was October? 

A: October 1944. 
Q: So it was already starting to get cold? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Then how long we
re you in Œ in 
La ndsberg
? 
A: Until March 1945. 

Q: So that™s how long? 

A: From end of October Œ 
Q: To March Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
63
A: Œ to March 1945. In
 Landsberg  Œ 
the only labor that we di
d over there, we worked 
the potato fields. They had so
me outside potato, buried 
potatoes and stuff. For the 
winter they would bury pota
toes, you know, they had th
ese potato like Œ like Œ like a 
little grave it looks like, yo
u know what I™m saying? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And we would dig 
out the potatoes for food. And I 
was one of the fortunate ones, 
got the job in the potato fiel
d and I used to organize pota
toes for my Œ for my friends 
in the camp. 

Q: You mentioned briefly 
that Œ that you left 
Auschwitz
 with two close friends. What 
happened to them? 
A: Okay , one was 
Jacob Buchler, b-u-a Œ b-u-c-h-l-e-r
, and the other one was 
Sydler
(ph), his name was 
Pishta
(ph) in Slovak. And both of
 these men Œ I ra Œ I left 
them and I ran from Œ you know. Bo
th  of these men ended up in 
Slovakia
, back in 
Slovakia
. 
Sydler
(ph) ended up in 
Bratislava
, the capital of 
Slovakia
. 
Buch ler 
went 
back to our hometown, which is called 
Topol™
any. Buch ler
 and his nephew, and Œ 
and his sist er, some Œ some of them
 that survived, en
ded up in 1948 in 
Israel.
 In 1981 
my wife 
Agnes 
and I went to the first gather
ing of Ho locaust survivors in 
Israel
, June 
11
th
, 1981. I did not see 
Buchler
, I spoke to  him on the phone. He, for some reason 
couldn™t make it, he was not fe
eling well, and we were talki
ng. That™s the last time I 
spoke to him and then he died in  ™
85. However, his nephew, whose name is
 Robert
, or 
Yehasure
(ph) 
Buchler
 became a historian, went to scho
ols, and as a matter of fact, I 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
64
just seen him last week in 
Israel.
 I™ve got a book here with
 me which is in Slovak 
about our hometown. Ev
ery member of that community 
of my city is Œ that was 
murdered by the Nazis, incl
uding my family, is listed inthis book. The other man, 
Sydler
(ph) ended up in 
Bratislava
, worked there for awhile . I™ve got letters from him 
at home now. He Œ only thing 
he wanted to  do, we should meet and go togeth er back 
to 
Auschwitz
 and then  go and beat every Po llack in
 the Œ in Œ in the streets. That™s 
what he writes in the Slovak letter. And un
fortunately, he wasn™t well when he left 
Auschwitz
. He Œ he was quite ill, a
nd he died quite young. I wo
uld say he died before 
1970. Oh, hell yes, before 1970 
because in 1964, I Œ I lived in 
Michig an City
, that™s 
the last I heard from him. 
Indiana
. And so, he died there, in 
Bratislava.
  
Q: You talk about not being able to cry in 
Auschwitz
. ﬁ
You
 
Cried, You Died
,ﬂ th e Œ  
the film you mentioned. Wh at do you mean by that? 
A: Well, you see, if you showed  weakness to
 the Nazis, they lik
ed that. They  killed 
you for Œ for it even easier. But if you show
ed that you were Œ still had a little Œ little 
gutsy  strength in you, they Œ 
th ey respected that a little bette
r, if you can call it respect. 
You know, they Œ the Œ this guy I testified against, 
Hans Kunneman
(ph), 
Heinrich 
Kunneman
(ph), he had the expression, when  he
 would see you after so many weeks, 
after week he sees you, you™re still alive, 
you™re still working, you
™re still striving, he 
would greet you, 
Du alter bandit, du lebs noch
. You old bandit, are you still alive? 
And he said it with such a respect that you still fought the sy
stem, that you still 
survived  the system, see? 
So, if you sh owed crying, you might as well lay down and 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
65
die. I couldn™t cry for my father. First time 
I was able to cry for 
him, it was January  27, 
1985, wh en I took my  tw o ch ildren with me
, when  I showed them
 the window which I 
seen my fa Œ my father from 
Œ through, on the barrack that
 he was taken. Took me a 
long time. When I said Kaddish
 over there for my father in 
front of that window, that™s 
when I broke down and cried for him.  
Q: Do you remember the first 
time you were able to cry at all when you came back? 
A: When  I came to this country ? When  my  daughter got engaged to be married.  
Q: That was the first time? 
A: That was the first time. I couldn™t Œ I 
couldn™t cry. Every once in  awhile when I 

speak now, and the question comes out s 
Œ a little stronger than Œ a little more 
personal, ab out my  parents, about my  fathe
r, about my  sisters, about my  mo ther, once 
in awhile I hold back  the tears and Œ I cried last week in 
Israel. 
Now, here™s why I 
cried last w eek in
 Israel
. I was asked by th e Jewish Welfare Federation of 
Indianapolis
, when we go to the Œ w
ith the family mission to
 Israel
, when we get to 
Yad Vashem , 
the Holocaust Memorial, would I be
 willing to address my group, the 
fellow Œ fellow Œ the travelers with me, at 
Yad Vashem
, and I agreed 
to do so. Not 
only did I address them, but I also got my  friend, this
 Buchler
, the historian to meet 
me there, h e teaches th ere at the Œ at th
e Holocaust memorial. And he told the group 
how I saved his life at 
Auschwitz
, and that mi Œ made Œ made
 me Œ well, I broke down 
and cried. Took me a little while to calm dow
n and tell my story after he left. So Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
66
Q: Do you ever Œ once you started Œ wh en
 your daughter got 
engaged, was it any 
easier, thereafter? 
A: Yes. It™s Œ it™s Œ it gets a little easi
er after you let it Œ let it loose, let go. 
Q: Cause that™s quite a few years. 

A: Yes, ™81. ™81. I don™t remember crying 
after Œ oh, maybe I Œ in  my  dreams maybe, I 
know wh en I have some bad nightmares. 

Q: Can Œ what are your dreams like? 
A: Most of the time I try to
 make them pleasant, but Œ 
Q: The bad dreams. 
A: The bad ones. The bad ones is 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Are there particular images that reoccur? 

A: See the faces. The faces of the Nazis. I 
can see every one of 
them. I can see them 
when I™m talking to you now. I can see 
the faces on the railroad tracks. I can see 
Mengele
 as clear as day. I™ll never forget the 
beatings. The 25 on your behind if they 
caught you with organizing food for other pr
isoners. As you were carrying the bundles 
of clothing to the wo men prisoners who 
did th e cleaning and disinfecting of the 
clothes, and all of a sudden the cane crook 
Œ the handle of the cane is behind your 
neck, and your neck and he 
pulls you down , he drops y
ou, you drop your bundle and 
he pokes with that stick in th
e Œ in there, in the clothes 
and he finds some food and he 
Œ befo re you even  turn around 
he smacks you right over the 
head with the cane, and he 
would ask, to wh at Jewish sow are you ta
king th is? And of course, if you tell, the 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
67
Jewish girl is in trouble. If you don™t tell,
 bend over, 25 on your
 behind. And you got 
to count. You co unt and he stops you. 
Ho w many did I give you? 17. Wrong, all over 
again. By the time he st-start
s all over again you already fainted, you™re already gone. 
So those are the things. I™ve got marks on 
my  Œ on my  Œ below my  belt now which 
never will go away. I™ve got a ma rk on my neck right here
 from a shovel by a Nazi. 
They  didn™t Œ life meant nothing to  them.  
Q: You know I Œ wh en I was getting ready to
 leave to come here
, I was talking to a 
friend of mine and sh e said, would you ask 
him for me  Œ that would be you Œ were 
there any mo ments of humanity
? Were there any guard s or an
ybody that worked at the 
camp, any of them that ha
d little pockets 
of humanity? 
A: Tell her that™s a very good ques
tion. The work  that we did, th e 
Kanada
 commando, 
unloading in coming Jews and th en, after the 
Nazis sorted them, selected them, you die 
now, you die later, then we start working with the belongings, w
ith the artifacts. And 
among th e artifacts is all sorts of watches, 
diamonds, rings, jewelry, because that was 
all confiscated. There were boxes for this 
merchandise, for these items. And the Nazis 
would march back and forth, back and forth.
 They were not allowe
d to bend down  and 
pick anything up. But a Nazi would see a wa
tch and he tells you, take that watch and 
take it to the latrine with you. And he 
would march you Œ with
 you Œ behind you 
towards the men™s latrine. And you squat, as
 you got this watch in
 your pocket and you 
throw it to him on the ground. He takes off hi
s rifle and with his rifle head he picks up 
the piece. So he™s good to you for Œ for a day 
or so. But as far as compassion, as far as 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
68
any feeling towards you, the 
only compassion feeling if 
they could benefit, because 
they cou Œ they Œ they
 were all on the take. They all kn
ew how. Everyone Œ every Nazi 
had their own prisoners who 
would organize for them. So they to ok care of you for 
awhile. But if he sees his superior coming 
towards you, regardless of wh at you gave 
him, he beat you just the same. So th
e compassion wasn™t there. They had no 
compassion, none whatsoever. Yeah, there we
re some people that Œ I know of Œ of a 
guy who knew a Nazi from his hometown, and he was the worst animal to him.  So 
there™s Œ there was s Œ there was some of th
em that would throw me a piece of bread 
only because you dealt with them, only becaus
e you gave them something. And th ey 
let you organize. They turned th eir backs so 
you could eat. You know, turn th eir head 
and Œ and Œ an-and Œ and Œ and 
turn your Œ turn away so 
they couldn™t Œ they wouldn™t 
see it, because if they seen 
it, they have to beat you. 
They knew we were eating, 
because they needed
 our hands at the railroad tracks.  
Q: Have you ever had Œ I think I know the 
answer to this, but have you ev er had an 
opportunity t-to ever si nce the war, talk to an
ybody on the other side? 
A: What side? 
Q: Any of the guards, any of the Œ 
A: Just in the trials. N o -Not directly to th
em, through their attorneys, yes. We accuse 
them of Œ of things that they did. As 
far as per Œ one on one, 
no, never met anyone. I 
may have met some , but I did 
Œ you know, may have been 
one, but I didn™t know who 
they were, you know.

Q: If you had that opportunity, would you take it? 
A: Yes, definitely would. And I wouldn™t do 
it with hate. I wouldn™t do it with hate. 
Conversation. I was asked to 
go on a program once and Œ an
d Œ with  Œ with these Œ the 
hate group, you know Œ 

Q: The clan? 

A: No, clan and also th-the Œ the white 
supremists
(ph) to go on Œ wh
at do you Œ what 
do you call that guy who Œ wh
o was fighting on the Œ he 
had a fight Œ fighting do Œ 
talk show? 

Q: 
Maury Povich? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
Q: Oh,
 Geraldo Rivera.  
A: 
Geraldo Rivera
. I got a call from his Œ from his sh
ow to come on w
ith Œ with two, 
one 
supremist
(ph) and Œ from a ri-ri-ridge Œ from that ridge place. 
Q: 
Ruby Ridge. 
A: 
Ruby Ridge
, and Œ and a Œ an d a clan guy to go 
Œ are you nuts? I wa
nt to go on th at 
program with these animals? First 
of all I wouldn™t go on his show. 
Geraldo Rivera
 is 
not my  person. That™s not my
 kind of show, not my  kind
 of people. And he™s half 
Jewish, too. 

Q: I know, I was about to say that. 

A: No, th at™s not me, no. Bu t I would go on
e on one, or I would 
go tw o on one. I™ll be 
one, they™ll be two. Let their t-tell their st
ory. Let me tell you Œ th is may not come Œ

this has nothing to do with 
this question. I have a fri
end who is a president of 
PBS 
in
 
Richmond, Virginia
, okay? He name is 
Charles Sidna
(ph), Jr., historian on Nazism. 
Wrote a couple of books on 
SS
. I met him th e firs
t time in 1990 in 
Honolu lu. 
Last 
October he went to 
Germany
 an d 
Austria
 with a number of historians for his ta Œ 
conference on Nazi German Œ Nazi Germ
an Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1945. Among 
them was a lso an 
SS 
guard, 
SS 
person who a Œ who was in there with him in the 
group. And here they are, they Œ 
there was a exhibit traveling to 
Germany
, and there 
was very mu ch Œ a lot of prot
est against that exhibit in 
Germany
. But they were there 
and talking, each one had th
eir own Œ own Œ the work. 
You know, one Œ one was on 
the Greek Jews, one was on Œ 
Q: A specialty. 
A: Special Œ sp Œ oh Œ own specialty, see, 
thanks. Also there was an Israeli boy who I 
met la st we ek , my  Œ  fro m my  
hometown. He too was there, okay? He is a historian 
from 
Israel .
 So he was the only Jew, there was a guy from 
Czech
 
Republic
, there was 
a guy from 
Poland
, there was a guy from 
Austria
, there was number of ca Œ people 
from 
Germany
, and they were talking. And they
 were demonstrating against him. 
Some German took a canister of salt and 
threw it through the 
window in s Œ in the 
build ing with a sign, here is your 
Zy k l o n  B
 gas. That™s Œ that happened last fall, okay? 
So my friend from 
Richmond, Virginia
, the president of 
PBS
, who made a film on 
me by the way, called 
ﬁ65316ﬂ
 and c Œ he calls me up a
nd tells me what happened, 
and he also told me that he was there with
 an  Israeli guy and he 
asked him where he is 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
71
from, he told him from 
Slovakia
 and from where, from the s Œ my  hometown. And he 
says to him, I know a guy from that town, too Œ my  friend from 
Richmond 
told him. 
He says, he lives in the 
States.
 So the guy says, I know who, 
Mike Vogel. Mike Vogel 
saved my  life at 
Auschwitz
. That™s the guy I told you a
bout. So here™s a guy, pitches 
salt, grain of salt like 
Zy kl o n  B  
gas into these people. So you see, Nazism, some  of 
these animals, when Œ 
when  someone shows, ﬁ
Hitler™s Willing Executioners,ﬂ
 or 
someone goes there for this type of a pur
pose, they™re still figh
ting it. They never 
admit. 
Q: Now, I Œ I asked your wife
 about this yesterday. Have 
you had encounters Œ cause Œ 
cause you™ve gone back to germ Œ you™ve gone to 
Germany
 several times Œ  
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ to testify. Have you had the 
opportunity to meet younger Germans Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ who were not alive then? 
A: Abso lutely. I meet you
nger Germans not only in 
Germany
, but I also meet them 
here, in this country. Students, c-college 
students, graduate students. And the question 
always comes, do I hate all Germans? Well
, I said, I don™t hate all Germans. However, 
all Germans my  age and older, and so me 
even younger were responsible for the 
atrocities th at happened to us, th
at Œ that was done to us. Ev
en if they themselves did Œ 
were not involved in  throwing us
 into the ovens, but they were
 part of the process, part 
of the organization, part of th
e hate, part of the people th
at killed us. However you, as 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
72
a young German, I can™t hold yo
u responsib le for the atroc
ity that happened to  us Œ 
done to us by a Œ by 
your grandparents. But when  you go
 back  home, ask your parents, 
if they were old enough, or
 your grandparents, what did 
they do from 1933 to 1945? 
What did they do to stop the at
rocities? What did they do to stop 
Kristallnacht
? W h at 
did they  do to stop deportation? What did th
ey do to stop taking
 away Jewish shops 
and Jewish busin esses? What did they do to  bu
rn Jewish temples? T h is is what you got 
to ask their parents, your pa
rents and grandparents. But as
 far as hating you, I don™t 
even hate your pare
nts, let alone you.  

Q: I have a dif Œ perh ap s a difficult question.
 I™m sure you™ve hear
d all these questions 
at one time or another. Have you ever pondered
 if by a twist of fate you were not born 
Jewish, but you were born German, or you 
were a Gentile Slovak in your hometown  Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Have you ever pondered ho
w you would have behaved? 
A: You know, I never thought ab out that, but 
I probably  would have been the same as 
the rest of them. I probably would have been
 same as the rest of
 them, because it was 
inbred  in them. It would be inbred in me Œ 
inbred-ed
 in me, because as
 much as these 
Slovaks or Hungarians or Po
les worked with Je
ws, worked for Jews or benefited by 
Jews or whatever, they were partners with th
em, or they were Œ they were part of their 
operation, they all were anti-Semites. And 
I probably would have 
been one of them. I 
grew up in it. You k
now, I referee soccer in 
Indianapolis
 in the state of
 Indiana
. 
There™s a German man named
 Hans Gut
, came to this countr
y in  the 50™s with his 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
73
father. And 
Hans
 is in his 50™s now, or better. ﬁ
Auschwitz
, 
If You Cried You Died
,ﬂ 
was showing the first time in 
Indianapolis
. It was shown nationally, but it was shown 
in 
Indianapolis 
that time, too. I went to do 
a high school soccer game and 
Hans Gut
 
was also one of their Œ one of Œ we were 
three referee Œ three Œ three people. There™s 
two linesmen and a Œ and a Œ an d a referee. 
And I was scheduled  to do the game and 
Hans 
is getting out of his car and I™m getting 
out of my  car from the park Œ school 
parking lot, we walked to
 the soccer field. And 
Ha ns Gut 
says to me, 
Mike
, I™ve seen 
your film last night. But don™t you think it™
s about time to stop this? Isn™t that enough 
of blasting, basting the Germans,
 of constantly Œ constantly 
Œ he says to me, my father 
was also in the Russian front. He says, he wa Œ he too suffered. I said, well 
Hans, 
let 
me tell you a little bit about 
my father. Your father was 
in Russian front. He had the 
guns, ammunition, clothes, boots. He was 
dressed. My father 
was stripped naked, 
stripped from his dignity, totally dehumanized
, taken to th e gas chambers, starved Œ 
first starved, tortured. I said, my father didn
™t have a gun to turn around and shoot his Œ 
shoot people who were putting hi
m in the ovens. Your father
 didn™t have to join the 
army. My father was forced in
to go in the concentration ca
mp and be killed. So what 
are you giving me this bullcrap 
about your father? So you 
see, people don™t want to 
see, the people don™t want to hear. And especially German people. 
Q: I Œ I s Œ I saw a television documentary
 about certain Gentiles that had hidden 

Jewish families Œ  
A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
74
Q: Œ during the Œ the war. And one of the 
survivors who had be
en hidden by th is 
Gentile man said, if it had been 
me, I wouldn™t have done it. 
A: He wouldn™t have saved him? 
Q: That™s right. 
A: That™s possible. 

Q: He s Œ he said, I wouldn™t have 
put my family at risk that way. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: He said, so I don™t understand this man w
ho did th is thing, who Œ who caused me to 
live and my family to live, and Œ you know
, so now that I can 
have children of my  
own. I™m glad he did it, but I don™t thin
k I would have done it if I were him.  
A: Mm, well, he™s right. Not too many did it,
 cause if there were so many Righteous 
Gentiles, why else Œ if there were so many,
 why so  many of us 
died, why so many was 
killed. Let me tell you my 
own personal experime
nt Œ experience with what you just 
asked me. First part of 1942, I was in a slave labor camp in 
Slovakia
 called
 Nováky.
 
There was a good friend of
 mine whose name was 
Josef Knap
(ph), 
Kanap
(ph) in 
Slovak, 
Kna p
(ph). 
Josef
 
Knap
(ph) had a Christian girlfriend, name was 
Terri
(ph) Œ 
Therese Œ ter Œ terra Œ terries Œ Th-Therese
. Him and I escaped together from 
Nováky.
 He knew his way pretty well, he was a
bout a year and a half older than me. 
We get to our hometown, 
Topo l™
any
, his Œ her father had a small farm on the 
outsk irts of our city and we two boys, esca
pees, going the back doors, back ways so 
we will get picked up by th
is Œ by the gendarmes, by the 
police of our town. Came to 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
75
this house hoping that I would be able to hi
de there too. Well, the father of the girl, 
father of 
Therese
, the father said, I™m taking 
Josef
 in my house and hide him, but I™m 
not taking a chance with  two Jews in my  
house. And here I am, stuck out on the 
outsk irt of our to wn , got picked  up by polic
e as I was walking back
 to town, beat the 
hell out of me, send me back to 
No vá ky .
 In 1946 I we
nt back to 
Slovakia
 wi Œ through 
the army because I went to get my papers and those two are still married, of course, 
they had a child. And she cried.
 She apologized to me that  her father wouldn™t take 
me. Her father died since, but he wouldn™t 
take me. So Œ but as fate would have it, I 
survived, she says, so at 
least I came to see them. 
Josef Knap
(ph) died, let™s see, 1990 
I was in 
Isr ael
 and there was a Czechoslovakian gath
ering of Ho locaust survivors, and 
there was another Jew Œ Jewish person ther
e who travels from Œ to my  hometown and 
he told me that he died a few months a
go. So the Righteous Ge
ntiles really weren™t 
that many. As far as the guy said he woul
dn™t do it, I believe it, because mo st people 
didn™t want to do it. My  father had enough
 Ch ristian friends and people that he dealt 
with, people that he sold horses and cattle to, that somebody could have saved us. 

Nobody was willing.  

Q: You earlier were talking about, when I 
was asking about anger,
 you were saying 
that i-i Œ I™m paraphrasing, that mo st of your
 anger is directed at the fact that you made 
it and your Œ your siblings and 
your parents didn™t. I Œ I Œ that classic thing th at is 
talked about with survivors is guilt. 
A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
76
Q: You know, why did I make
 it and other people didn™t. 
Would you call that guilt? 
A: It™s guilt, yeah, it™s guilt. You know, pe
ople would also pul Œ ge Œ put guilt Œ guilt 
on us. 
Q: How so? 
A: When I Œ ™46 when I went to my homet
own, was a small Jewish community left 
that came b ack, and th Œ some that were 
hidden. You know, how did you make it and 
my  parents didn™t, my  sisters and brothers
 didn™t? Why Œ wh at 
Œ why sh ould you be 
the lucky one, and not Œ not Œ I Œ why shouldn™t
 I have my  brother or sister here? I had 
nobody left, and they™re still
 putting Œ put the guilt on me. 
So they Œ the people put 
guilt on us. You know, at first 
I was even afraid to speak ab out it. Here I am, survived 
the camps and nobody else did 
Œ did it in my family, so w
hy sh ould I be guilty that I 
survived? 
Q: So you were afraid that by talkin
g about it people would Œ it would beg the 
question Œ 
A: Would make the questions, yeah. 

Q: Œ how come you made it? 

A: How come your Œ your not dead, too? 
Q: Hold  on for a second. 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Michael Vogel. 
This is tape number three, side
 A. 
You mentioned this trial that 
happened while you
 were living in 
Detroit
 that your friend 
Ku lka
 or -- 
Kulka
 is that Œ 
did I get that right? 
A: Yeah, which one? 

Q: I-In the Œ in the Œ in the tr Œ video in
terview, you mentioned in passing that when 
you were living in 
Detroit Œ
 maybe this is incorrect or th
ey got co nfused, you were in 
the midst of telling a story about while you were living in 
Detroit
 and then  you 

interspersed into that, or inte
rpolated into that, talking ab
out a trial that this fellow, 
Eric Kulka
 was involved with, and I think it c
onfused the Ho locaust Museum people, 
whether that was a trial that ha
ppened while you were living in 
Detroit
. 
A: While I was living in 
Detroit.
 I™m sorry. This was Œ actually, I was not living in 
Detroit 
any more, I was living in the 
States
. This trial was in 
Germany
, okay? And 
Kulka
 was part of the trial and so was 
Joe Neumann
(ph)
 Œ Josef Neumann
(ph)
, Joe 
Neumann
(ph)
.
 The trial was held in 
Frankfurt
 against a former Nazi, and I don™t 
reme mb er which one it was. It was also
 photograph brought there and th ere™s a 
photograph of me in Œ taken by the Nazi
 documentation department. And Œ and that 

photograph was used as evidence. Is 
that what they want to know, is Œ 
Q: They were just wondering about th-the
 Œ whether, you know, they were unclear 
what that trial was and whether it was happening in 
Detroit
. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
78
A: No, no, no, no. 
Q: Okay , okay. 

A: Trial was done in 
Frankfurt,
 
Germany. 
This was one of the first trials of Œ of Nazi 
trials. This was later th an 
Detroit
, you know, I was not living in 
Detroit
, I was Œ that 
was not 
Detroit
, because I didn™t know about
 Kulka
 in 
Detroit
 yet. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Okay. This was the trial in 
Germany
 against the former Nazi guard, Nazi Œ a Nazi 
guard . That was in 
Germany
, and this photograph 
wh ich I have Œ which
 Kulka
 by th e 
way, gave me in 1981 in 
Israel
, copy of it, this was used 
as evidence, this photograph, 
identifying the prisoners that we
re a Œ in that photographs. Je Œ Holocaust Museum has 
the photograph. They  have it. 

Q: Did you Œ you™ve already 
told me how you felt about 
Nuremberg
, that you felt it 
was Œ 
A: Mm, a farce. 
Q: A farce. How much did 
you follow th e various postw
ar trials that occurred? 
A: Well, the trial that I really followed, 
the first one I have tried Œ I followed was 
Eichmann
 trial. That to me was the trial to be 
watched. And yet, to the last minute the 
guy didn™t admit to anything.
 And he was the mastermind of
 the railroad tracks of the 
ca Œ of the cattle cars. He was the gu
y who Œ who Œ who 
had another guy, 
Dieter 
Wisliceny
 who was Œ who he Œ he sent to 
Slovakia
 to Œ to get us out of there, who he 
sent to 
Greece
 to get the Greek Jews. And Œ and Œ an
d this man to the last mo ment did 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
79
not admit Œ only thing he said, I 
followed orders. And as far as 
Eichmann™s 
capture, it 
wasn™t done because of 
Simon Wiesenthal
, it was done because of the Israeli 
Mossad. 
And 
Simon Wiesenthal 
want Œ took it Œ th e credit for that, but it is no longer 
the credit for Œ he doesn™t take it any more, I™m sure of it. Excuse me. 
Q: When  you Œ jump ing around here a bit Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Prior to when  you talked at your daughter™s school Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ during that large gap of time prior to th
at, that you lived in th is country, and after 
you were close with this group of survivors in 
Detroit 
when you first came over Œ 
A: Mm. 
Q: Œ did you talk Œ how of
ten would this ever come 
up with friends, coworkers, 
colleagues? I mean, you have the tattoo Œ 
A: You mean Œ oh Œ 
Q: Œ people asking you Œ 

A: Oh su re, people would ask ab out the tattoo,
 of course. I used to make kind of fun of 
it, so to speak. This 
is my telephone number, this is
 my  house address, which by th e 
way, becomes my home Œ home address no
w, because when I bought this house Œ 
when I Œ when we were moving here 30 ye
ars ago, looking fo r a home and the real 
estate lady takes me in this neighborho
od an d I see a address, 6531. My number is 
65316. I said, we™re going to 
buy th is house. My wife says
, you gotta be crazy. I says 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
80
why? I never Œ I Œ I can never lose my Œ if 
I lose my way I know I got it on my arm, 
you know, I said Œ no, she sa
ys, don™t Œ don™t Œ let™s not 
buy this house. I Œ so we 
bought it anyway, you know. 
So th at™s a sick sense of humor in me, you know. I 
bought the house only Œ not 
only because it was a good price, but it also had a right 
number. So coworkers, yeah, they always ask.
 Not co Œ s-strangers on the street, in a 

restaurant, when it™s summertime you go there 
in a short sleeve shirt. They look at you 
first and they don™t want to say anything, 
they ™re kind of you know. And wh at am I 
gonna do, cover it like this? No. So  Œ you were
 in one of them camp s, huh? Ye Œ wa Œ 
wa Œ one of them bad Nazi camps, huh? 
And I, oh yeah , I says. Could you tell me a 
little bit ab out it? I says no, not in a restau
rant, you know. You got children in school, I 
said, we have a film o v er there. Or wa Œ 
you Œ ev er go here, you 
can find out. You go 
to the children™s museum, they
 have s-stuff on the Ho locaust, you know. So  th-that Œ 
that always comes up, always, there isn™t 
Œ I tho Œ there isn™t a day when  somebody 
doesn ™t stare at you when y
ou have the number exposed . I™
ll tell you another story. In 
1961 we lived in
 Clev eland, Ohio
. I was working for a company called 
Shoppers 
Fair
. I was straightening out a couple of shel
ves in the store with my sleeves Œ short 
sleeve shirt on. A guy walks in, he says
, you got number. I know man got numb er. 
Talks with an accent. I said
 oh yeah, you do? Okay. I br
ing him here. Next day he 
drags in a gu Œ brings in a guy, we were togeth er in 
Auschwitz
. This guy™s name was 
Mutti
(ph) 
Klein
(ph). He worked w
ith my father with the horses at 
Auschwitz
. We 
became f Œ of course, close 
friends until we moved to 
Cleveland
, he Œ they Œ a-and Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
81
and he eva Œ a-a-after awhile he got 
a heart attack. Then
 he retired in 
Florida
. In 1990 
we went to 
Israel
 ag-again for the gathering, and he
 didn't make it b ecause he was ill. 
And there I met some people 
that know him also because 
they came the same time as 
we did to  
Auschwitz
. We got home to 
Indianapolis, 
we found out a few months later 
he died. So that was also
 thro ugh his number because the guy seen me at work, 
stocking shelves at 
Shoppers Fair.
 So the number is always there and always comes 
up in the conversation wherever
 I go. And when I went to  
Germany
 to test Œ testify, I 
made it a p o int when we were free from court,
 and we went for train rides and went Œ 
anywhere we went, I would always 
[indecipherable]
 summertime, of course we were 
there summ ertime, I would sit there Œ and always would like to sit close to an older 
German, just to let him see the number. And th
ey would look at you, then  they  put the 
head down and never lo ok at 
you again. Probably couldn't 
get a Œ couldn™t Œ couldn™t 
wait to get off the next stop. Yeah, the num
ber is there unfortunately and it™ll stay 
there as long as I live. 
Q: You talk Œ you™ve talked quite a bit ab out this gathering in 1981. What was that 

like?  

A: This was the most Œ fir Œ first of all it 
was the first gathering 
ev er, okay? This was 
the mo st emotional four or
 five days we had in 
Israel
. We had a su rvivor village in Œ 
in 
Jerusa lem
. There were computers set up all over the creation Œ all over the place 
and ev ery one of us was listed in the comp
uter, who we were, where we came from. 
And this is how I met in person, 
Eric Kulka
. I didn™t know Œ first of all, I didn™t know 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
82
Eric Kulka
. I didn™t know who 
Eric Kulka 
was. I get a message at the 
Hilton 
Jerusalem
, note
 Eric Kulka, 
telephone number. Call up
 Eric Kulka
 and he tells me 
who he is. 
Eric Kulka™s
 wife was mu rdered by th e Nazis, so what he did, he took his 
wife™s maiden name and ch anged his name. 
Q: In tribute? 

A: In Œ yeah, in Œ in tri
bute for his wife, yeah. He™s 
got a son who teaches at the 
University of 
Jerusa lem
, also a historian and a writer of books. So 
Eric 
died, I was 
told the other day, last week, year and a 
half ago. Kidney failu
re. But he was much 
older than me, 
Eric
 was in his late 80™s. I also saved his life, yeah. But 
Eric
 was quite 
a guy.  
Q: Have you been  to the mu seum Œ you™ve been to the mu seum in 
D.C.
? 
A: A number of times, yes. 
Q: What was that like the fi
rst time you went there? 
A: Well, the first time I went there was for 
the opening when  Œ wh
en the Œ when it was 
the g Œ th e grand opening of the Holo caus
t Museum. That was in April 1993. The 
coldest, rainiest day you ca
n imagine, it was so cold. A
nd we Œ we said, it fits the 
occasion, the oc Œ the opening fits the occa
sion. Three of our kids came with us, two 
daughters and a son and my wife 
and I. And I was written up in the 
U.S.
 Œ th e 
U.S.A.
 
today in the Œ because of the 
opening. And this was too, 
very, very emotional. The Œ 
the Œ the Œ th e demonstrators, they Œ the park
 police, of course, took care of them after 
awhile. They  had demonstrators up to a point
 and after that they took care of them. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
83
The-They  blocked th em off with buses, they
 could Œ you couldn™t see them any mo re. 
And of co urse, it was so emotional. But the ™81 in  
Israel
, that is where I met 
Kulka
 
and met some other people, a couple guys from 
France
 who worked with me in the 
Kanada
 commando. And th en Œ that was the hard
est part. That was the Œ that was the 
hardest part for me. When at 
Ya d Va shem
 we heard a first speech by a Œ the le Œ one 
of the leaders of the group, and man there wasn
™t a dry eye in the place. This is when I 
really cried, when they start talking, my
 numb er is such and such . And then  you 
walked through the 
Ya d Va shem 
Museum where all the photographs of Œ original 
photographs of Nazis that t Œ took Œ the do
cumentation, Nazi documentation took. As I 
walked through, I™ve 
seen the railroad tracks where 
I worked. And 
I™ve seen the 
prisoners whom I knew  and I point Œ could 
point out who th ey were. And th at broke 
me down. And 
NP R 
was there, she interviewed me, 
a lady interv iewed me, I couldn™t 
finish the interview, that™s how bad I was. That was very, very emotional. And we 
went Œ since then, of course, we went to a 
few mo re gathering Œ Ho locaust gathering. I 
had the great honor, because of the 
Holocaust Museum 
and the Holocaust 
organization, May eighth, this pa
st May eighth, be invited to 
Wa shington, D.C.
 at the 
capital rotunda to do the 
Ho locaust Memo rial Kaddish . So I did May eighth in 
Washin gton,
 which was also very beautiful. 
Q: So le-let me ask you a question about y
our faith. You Œ we™ve talked ab out your 
problems with God. I Œ I gather from talki
ng to you and to your 
wife that you were 
less than enthusiastic about raising 
your children in an  observant home. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
84
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And Œ and yet, y
ou say the Kaddish. 
A: What is it? 
Q: And Œ and yet, th Œ 
you said the Kaddish  Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ and that Œ 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Œ is meaningful to you. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Are you Œ how can I phrase the question?
 Have you become any mo re comfortable 
or interested, or Œ 

A: The last few years, last few years I Œ 
I™m Œ  I go to the temple
s Friday nights. I™m 
still a little thinking about it, just what am 
I doing here, but yet I feel I must d o  it now, 
especially now. I™m getting older and it™s ti
me to identify myself more, not just by 
name, but also by attending the servic
es, hoping to heal a little different.  
Q: Is it helping? 

A: Yes, I think it™s helping. I think it™s 
helping because the co
mmu n ity  kno ws me so  
well now and they identify me with this. Th
e Jewish community relations which I am a 
chairman of the Holocaust Committee here in  t Œ in our organization, and anytime 

something happens, they call 
on me. At the state capital ro
tunda here, I was asked to 
speak, als Œ May sixth, two days before 
Wash ington.
 They wanted to also make it 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
85
May eighth, I said, I™m sorry, I can™t attend 
it, you have to get someone else. No, we 
don™t want someone else, we want you. So  
we make it on May sixth. So they  made it 
on May sixth and th ere too I spoke, and I was 
asked by the community to do the holoc 
Œ to do the Kaddish for the ser-service. So
 the community is kind of pushing me 
towards this sort of a making me part of 
Œ the Holocaust Jew to be the spokesperson. 
Any time they need someone, newspapers here
, local papers, the television channels Œ 
there isn™t a television program on Holo caust 
that I™m not involved 
in that they don™t 
call me. When 
Shpindler Œ ﬁSchindler™s List
ﬂ was shown, I was asked to be on the 
program. 
Yom HaShoah
 co mes around, the Day of Rememb rance, I am asked to be 
on programs. So I™m Œ now I feel 
I™m coming back to my  roots. 
Q: Do you ever wish that 
you were not born  Jewish? 
A: No. No, no, never. I am pr
oud of my  heritage, but I Œ the only problem I had was 
God and I think I™m healing a little bit.  
Q: One of the things that they
 wanted me to talk to you ab
out is y-your observations of 
what has been going on in the wo rld su
rrounding you since yo
u™ve been back Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ from 
Euro pe,
 since you™ve been in th is country. Through th e lens of one who has 
had the ex periences that you have had in 
th e Holo caust, and I™m wondering Œ I™ll ask 
you about a few things Œ 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ you Œ I think you overh
eard me talking to your wi
fe about this yesterday. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
86
A: Okay . 
Q: Well, in a general way let me ask you wh
at Œ what fears do you continue to have 
here? I don™t mean fear of water, fear of de
ntists, but fears for this country , fears for Œ 
worries about hate groups Œ 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ political fringes, religious groups Œ 

A: Well, the hate groups is one of them. Y
ou see, the First Amendm
ent in this country 
is a beautiful item, but the First Amendm
ent should stop somewhere. It should stop 
with these hate groups, it s
hould stop with the Œ with the 
KKK
, they  shouldn™t have 
their rights with the First Amendment, I™m 
sorry. Neither should
 have the skinheads 
and the white 
supremists
 shouldn™t have that, the racist
s shouldn™t have that, the anti-
Semites shouldn™t have that, they shouldn™t ha
ve the First Amend Œ that should Œ that 
has nothing to do with the First Amendment.
 You may na Œ disagree with me, but 
these are Œ there™s just got to be stop so mewh
ere. Well, h ere is a guy who has got First 
Amendment rights, he kille
d 160 people in Œ in 
Oklahoma.
 This is the First 
Amendment. He shouldn™t be even  tried. 
He should be given to th e people in 
Oklahoma City
 and they should take care of it. 
That™s Œ may sound cruel, but look 
how cruel he was. So these are the fears I ha
ve, that because of our freedom in our ri Œ 
lives, we let all these g roups do whatever th ey want to do and th
ey murder, then we 
put them to death row and they stay there 
for 15 years and 16 times
 they say Œ th-the 
governor says a Œ a stay of execution and th
ey stay, he goes back there and you feed 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
87
him and you spend money on him.
 These Œ these are fears I have. I have fears of these 
hate groups. I have fears of all these Œ a
ll these anti-Semites, al
l these racists. Y ou 
know, this is what Œ this is 
what scares me, this Œ this 
is Œ and now wa
 Œ why does it 
scare me so  much? Because all you got to
 have, all you need, God forbid , is bad 
economy. These are the people th
at will lead the other middle 
America
, and middle
 
America
 is a na Œ dangerous world, believe me
. I™ve seen them, I-I
™ve seen them in 
action, you know, doing my  Œ sometime my  
Œ some my  speeches, I Œ sometime I get 
these middle Americans in there too. Bu t th ese are the ones you™ve got to be careful 
with. The fundamen
talists, the middle
 America
. The ones who push the ji Œ push their 
religions onto you. These are the ones th
at you worry about. The white Œ white 
supremists
, who are they? They co
me from the churches. What Œ lot of them. Th-
They  Œ th ey all God loving, Christ feari
ng white Anglo-Saxon Americans. And these 
are the ones that can lead th
e mili Œ militia that can lead
 this countr
y into ruin. 
Q: When  you say middle 
America
, wh at are you referring to ? That™s a kind of a vague 
Œ 

A: I™m referring to the Œ the white 
supremist, 
that they call themselv es the middle s -- 
pure Americans. If you black 
you have no business to live 
in their neighborhood. If 
you Jew, you Œ your Œ you™re 
a bloodsucker. If you™re an As
ian, if you™re any Œ any Œ 
any of these Asian countries, 
they hate you. Look what™s 
happened  in  Œ happened in 
New York
, all these p Œ all these poor Koreans or
 Œ or Œ or Asians are working their Œ 
every member in the family is
 working in their little grocer
y store trying to eke out a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
88
living, work ing, 24 hours a day open and 
th ey try to make a living and yet these Œ 
these Œ these animals, the wh
ites beat the hell out of them
. And Œ and their some Œ so 
do so me Œ some blacks do the same thing to
 them, it was a ca Œ 
it™s happened there 
was the blacks that came after them.  
Q: Have you been  any mo re c
oncerned in th e recent past than in th e decades prev ious? 
A: Yes, because it™s Œ now we have the ne
ws media that keeps bringing it Œ bringing 
the Œ all these atrocities up, brings Œ bringing
 the news up, which we
 didn™t have in the 
past like we have it today. I wish we
 had th e news media during my  time in 
Auschwitz
, before 
Auschwitz
, probably wouldn™t have been 
Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t know, if 
you had 
CNN
 then, who knows what wo
uld happen. Bu t the Œ but it wasn™t as bad in 
years back. Years back, 
yes, there was anti-Semitism, racism and all 
[indecipherable] 
I™m Œ I™m afraid always will be anti-Semitism
 and racism as far 
as Œ as long as we 
have this kind of a population as we 
have here, the Œ the Œ the Œ an d middle 
America
 
that loves the pure white people. So  Œ but that
 scares me, it scares me that if ano Œ be 
another Holocaust, that can be a lot of tr
oubles, that can creat
e a lot of problems. 
Q: What should we do 
to ward that off? 
A: Indifference and education. Indifference,
 teaching people wh at indifference means, 
stands for. Indifference, don™t look at me th
at I™m dark eyed and 
brow-bro wn  hair and 
dark skin , look at me as a person, that I™m  your neighbor, that I™m y our citizen, I™m the 

same citizen as you are, and don™t put the ha
te on me because of what I am, w h at I was 
born. That™s the indifference. Education, 
teach these people what can happen wh en 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
89
hate and racism and 
anti-Semitism flourishes. What ca
n happen when poor economy 
can bring these people to do wh at 
Hitler
 did to the Jews a
nd other minorities.  
Q: That was something I wanted  to ask you 
about. Obviously  other people died in the 
Holocaust, other than Jews. 
A: Mm-hm, yes. 

Q: The Gypsies. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Homo sexuals.  
A: Jehovah Witnesses. Jehovah Witnesses. 

Q: Mm-hm. Have you had much contact 
with je Œ with Ge
ntile survivors? 
A: I haven™t met too many. I met some, but 
not too many. Very few Gentile survivors 
come forward, very, very few. I had contac
t with liberators, but not survivors. And I 
wish I had contact with some survivors. Th
ere were Poles, there were Œ there were 
political prisoners. Of course, the criminal prisoners, you know. 

Q: Priests. 

A: Priests, Academians. Very, very seldom, 
I na Œ don™t think I met maybe one or two 
in my lifetime here. And I do
n™t even remember where.  
Q: Just wondering. 

A: I wish I would, because there are some
 aro u nd, believe me, there are some people 
around. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

Q: I know that I read a book
 recently about the Gypsies a
nd the proportion of Œ of the 
Gypsies that were killed Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ gi-given the size of the Œ 
A: Well, the Œ a-and they had a Gypsy camp  in 
Birkenau
, just Œ Gypsy family camp, 
and in Œ in less than two nights, two nights 
[indecipherable]
 boom, boom, boom, one, 
two, three, they murdered 
close to 30,000 Gypsies, and some of them had German 
army  uniforms on, some of the men. Came  
from the Wehrmacht, th
ey picked them up 
and brought them to 
Auschwitz
. German Gypsies. 
Q: What about outside of this country? We
 talked about the m
ilitia movement and the 
clan and what about things that you
™ve observed outside of this country, 
Yugoslavia
? 
A: You mean the 
Bo snia ,
 th-th-th -that Œ that proble
m there? It™s a horrible item, 
horrible thing. 
Elie Wiesel 
went to 
Bo snia  
so me years back and begged the people, 
don™t do this to your people. Look what happ
ened to us. He went 
to see th Œ some of 
the prisoners who he could see them thr
ough the Œ through th e elect Œ through th e 
fences and seen people w
ith this Œ like s Œ looking 
like skeletons. But you know, 
there™s a difference between Holocaust and Œ and 
Bo snia
 
[indecipherable]
 
Yugoslavia. 
The difference is all 
[indeciphera ble]
 had guns. They  had weapons. They  
were fighting each other with weapons. Et
hnic Œ a fa Œ wh-what 
were they fighting 
for? Religious Œ religion ethn
icity, for ethnics. And with 
us, we didn™t ha
ve guns or 
ammunition 
[indecipherable]
 it was different. But at the same time, it was a 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
91
holocaust. Look what 
they™ve done to a be
au tiful country, the 
Yugoslavia
. Years 
before the winter sports were held in that
 beautiful part of the wo rld, and now the 
whole country is ruined. Other than a Œ other than 
Croatia
 which is still in a fairly 
decent shape. So that was a holocaust. 
Cambodia
, the boat people. 
Vietnam 
war was 
another one. You know, when 
Vietnam 
war first started, when it Œ when it was first 
started in the 60™s, late 60™s, I was for it. I 
was for the Americans. After all, here is the 
United States
 
of America
, you Œ you know, 
you go fight, don™t Œ 
don™t knock the 
soldiers that are going there. And after aw
hile, when I listened to my children who 
were at the time colleg e age, you know, 
and th ey were goin
g demonstrating in 
Washin gton 
against it, I tried to listen and reas
on with them. But kids, they™re fighting 
for freedom. So the kids would tell me, wh
at™s freedom? It™s 10,
000 miles Œ 20 thou Œ 
10,000 miles away from us, what kind of
 freedom? They™re killing innocent children 
and women, is that a freedom? 
So when I first started I w a
s very much for it, then I 
had to go with my  kids. I™ve 
seen that what they were ta
lking about, they were right. 
Maybe they were too radical about it. Ma
ybe they went overboard , maybe. And some 
of them did. I mean, in  spite of the drugs,
 they brought some Œ 
some good things out 
of it, these young people. 
Q: What about Œ I was thinking Œ I Œ I mean
, I™m not trying to  make parallels to what 
happened  to  you, but I™m just wondering about
 things that have happened in  history 
that might have particularly concerned you 
or chilled you or Œ or the Œ what Œ and I 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
92
was thinking about what happened in 
Rwanda
 in th e past couple of years, where one 
side basically annihilated the other side. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. The 
tutsu Œ tutu Œ tutues
 and Œ and 
Tutsi 
then. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Well, that is a holocaust, a horrible, ho
rrible, horrible crime. No one even there 
helped, re-really. What did 
they  do? Th-They fly Œ a plane flew over and Œ and 
dropped some food and people were killing each
 other fo r the piece of food that they 
could find. In Œ in Œ look, 
Bosnia
 and 
Yugoslavia
, no one helped five, six years ago 
w h en  th ey  sh ou ld  h a ve
 helped. That™s when 
they should have stopped right there. This 
is when the help should have co
me, not today with the sending Œ 
Clin ton 
sends the 
army over there now? Now you send the army
 over there? Send the army there before 
the first shot was fired. 
Control it and try to do the 
Dayton
 before 
Dayton.
 You know 
what I™m trying to say? Don™t go to 
Dayton
 after every Œ after 
nine million people are 
murdered. Go there 
before. Make the 
Dayton 
in Œ in 
Yugoslavia
, in
 Croatia
, in 
Bosnia
. This is where you do it. Nobody paid  
attention. The next
 door neighbors, 
Germany
, the 
Hitler 
y Œ nobody did anything. When
 I was there testifying in 
Germany
 in ™91, it was still early enough to go
 there and try to stop all that. They 
were just trying to start Œ starting to shoot. 
That™s the time to go there, but oh well, we 
can™t send our sons to be mu rdered  over 
there. Nobody asked th
em to be murdered 
over there, nobody is mu
rdered there now. One 
[indecipherable]
 the guy got lost in 
the wooded area someplace, shot down or wh
atever happened to 
him and he survived. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
93
And all you had to do was go th ere, send 
their armed forces over there and control 
them, send the 
UN 
over there before it happened, not after it happened. So  these are 
the things that 
should be done. 
Rwa nda
 the same way. Look 
Œ did you see all these 
starving little innocen t children? Who did they 
hurt? Same thing like the one and a half 
million Jewish children murder
ed by the Nazis. Poor, i
nnocent children. How many 
professors, how many scientists, how ma
ny teachers, how many doctors were 

murdered among th ese little one and a half m
illion children? The same thing with the 
Rwanda
 people. Maybe they weren™t professors in
 ta Œ i-i-in Œ i-i-in Œ but they were 
human beings and nobody help
ed. Everyone turned their h
ead the other way. We were 
watching the news programs a Œ while we 
eating dinner and they  would say to  e Œ to 
wife Œ wife to a husband, look at this, isn™
t that terrible what ha
ppening over there? 
Oh, wh at™s on tonight. You know, that was th
e end of the conversation. What else is 
on television?  
Q: So now we do have 
CNN
, now we do know, we Œ we
 can™t feign ignorance. 
A: And we didn™t do anything. And we
 didn™t do anything. We watching for
 CNN
 to 
bring us atrocities. Everybody is look
ing for something terrible to happen. 
Middle 
East
, the fights, the Œ th e Œ the Œ the fights 
between Palestinians 
and thro wing stones, 
they™re throwing rocks,
 they™re doing Œ they  Œ they™re burning tir
es, the Œ the Œ the Œ 
that Œ this is what 
CNN
 is for, this all the newscast is
 for, but no one does anything.  
Q: What would you suggest people do? 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
94
A: The big countries, the po
wers should be the ones. 
You know, I know it sounds Œ 
sounds like easy task to do, but we should be
 the ones to be the guards of the wo rld. 
And not with guns and ammunition, but sendi
ng people to try to 
solve their problems 
talking. Get into the table with these people. 
Get to the Œ to get to the com Œ get to the 
conferences with these people. There are 
some people it™s ha
rd to talk with. 
Q: You know, I™m just thin
king Œ oh, first of all, I want to check my tape. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Michael Vogel. 
This is tape number three, side
 B
 and we were talking about 
ways of intervening to prevent future Œ 
A: Holo causts. 

Q: Œ holo causts. And I was thinking, you kn
ow, of the Œ the real notorious leaders, 
political figures, 
Hitler, Stalin, Mao,
 Pol Pot, Idi Amin
, the Œ the Serbian leader, 
Milosevic
. How do you Œ these people don™t seem
 very reasonable, from everything 
I™ve been told. 

A: Mm-hm, yeah they aren™t
. They ™re not reasonable. But these are the people that the 
governments, like 
United States
, 
Soviet u Œ 
or ru Œ former 
Soviet Unio n, 
anyone who 
has power should go to these people and 
say, enough killing. Let™s sit down and talk 
about the 
tuti Œ Tutus 
and let™s talk about the Bosn
ians, let™s talk about the 
Cambodians here, the 
Pol Pots
, the Œ the killings, it™s got 
to stop. And someone has 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
95
got to do it. Now, I know it™s not easy a
nd I know you Œ somebody™s going to tell me  
that I™m full of bull talking like this, because
 who is going to mix 
in in someone else™s 
kitchen? Well, s-some one has to mix in in 
someone else™s kitchen, because we can™t 
go on like this. One thing stops,
 something else starts. There is never a dull mo ment as 
far as somebody 
killing somebody. On e country. These 
[indecipherable]
 Rwandan 
people, these Œ these little innocent childre
n should be saved. Who™s going to  save 
them? Not the 
Tutsis
 and not whatever you want to call them 
Tutus 
or 
Tutsis
, it™s 
gotta be done by a powerful country and it™
s got to stop. And if somebody said well, 
we have enough problem in this country, we have racism and anti-Semitism here, sure 
we do, but in the meanwhile we™re not st
arving, and th ose people are starving. And 
those people have to be put to
gether, those people had to have
 help with the Œ from our 
technology from farming and fo r everything. 
Everyone Œ if you he
lp people to Œ to 
feed them, you™re gonna star
t Œ you™re gonna pa Œ st-stop 
a lot of these atrocities. 
Education.  

Q: Do you Œ do you feel 
reasonably safe here now? 
A: In this country, yes. Very 
much so. I Œ I feel safe because this is the best country in 
th Œ in spite of all our problems, in spite of 
all isms that we have 
here, this is still the 
best country in the world, and I™ve been
 around a few countries. I™ve been around 
Euro pe
, I™ve been around the 
Middle East.
 This country is the country that I love, and 
like I tell my children, you can sing
 America [indecipherable] 
three times a d ay, 
cause there™s no other country like it.

Q: Why? Why is it so great in your mind? 
A: Because of the freedom, because of the 
freedom of speech, that you can say what 
you Œ wh at you mean and no one™s going to
 arrest you for it, no one™s going to  shoot 
you for it. You couldn™t talk like this in s Œ in 
Russia
 even  today, you couldn't  talk like 
this in some of the European countries, 
unless you go on the stre
ets and start fighting 
like they do in 
Ireland
.  
Q: Tell me about becoming a citizen
. What was that like for you? 
A: That will stay as one of the f Œ best th
ing ever happening to me. Of course, I could 
have been a citizen mu
ch sooner if I would have stayed with the 
United States
 Armed 
Forces. I could have become a 
citizen as soon as I left 
La Havre 
on the way to far east 
Japa n
 to Œ to be a replacement 
so ldier to occupy Œ the o
ccupying forces. But since I 
didn™t, I had to wait and I got Œ I was taken Œ I was mak e a ci Œ made a citizen in 

Detroit, Michigan
. And when  I went to the federal 
court, after I took a test Œ you 
know, they give you so mu
ch time to Œ to Œ to learn the test, who was the 16
th
 
president, who was this, who was that, and 
to become a citizen, with a number of 
people with you, and you get 
the oath and th ey give you a 
flag in your hand, that was 

the greatest thing ev er Œ ever for me. A
nd I™ve tell you, I have never missed an 
election. State, federal, presidential, none 
of them, never. That is my  right and I kiss 
the ground for that.  

Q: Have you gotten involved much 
with politics in th
is country?  

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
97
A: Not really, not really. The on Œ some
time when I speak about
 my experiences, 
politics do come up and I very ki
ndly turn it down because 
I am not knowledgeable in 
politics. I read the papers, I have my opinions . My opinions are for me and my family. 
I will not s Œ force something on some
one else. I will not tell you that I™m a 
Republican or a Democrat because I am a 
person for persons. And 
that™s the way it is, 
I don™t get involved . I do help once in awh
ile with some campaign people, they say 
would you do th is or
 would you do th at. 
I don™t do an y fundraisers, but I help 
sometimes, organizations, you know, they  
ask me to. I don™t belong to too many 
organizations. I belong to the men™s clu Œ me
n™s brother Œ brotherh ood in  our temp le, 
and I™m a member of the temple 
[indecipherable]
 the Jewish community relations. 
And I have the highest soccer referee lic
ense y ou can get, and those are the 
organizations that I™m part of. 
Q: I wanted to ask you about, and in the co
ntext of your st Œ putti
ng the soccer into this 
context, what things have 
given you pleasure, 
have given you joy 
since you™ve been 
back from 
Auschwitz
? What are the things that you 
have, in the past 50 years gotten 
the most Œ 

A: Well, first and foremost, my children andmy wife, that™s the first thing. There™s n-
not the greatest pleasure than
 to see childrens achieve, and I can say about my  
children, they™re all achievers, every one 
of them. Second, of course, watching my 
grandchildren being born. That 
is another pleasure, there™s 
five of them and sixth one 
coming. I am not mu ch of a art museum pers
on, but being th at the childrens are very 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
98
mu ch involved in arts, I do go with them so
metimes, in fact Sund
ay we went to the 
museum with my wife. And of course, the 
enjoyment that I have
 is teaching young 
people the game of soccer. I happen to be one of the people, unfortunately the second 
person th at was part of it passed away at 
a very young age, at
 the age of 47, an 
Englishman. The two of us star
ted soccer in the state of 
Indiana
, so  to speak. So to 
speak, no, we Œ we used to tr
avel the state to  give clinic
s to coaches and to kids. And 
we would take our play ers, who were alrea
dy more knowledgeable 
in soccer than the 
rest of the state of
 Indiana
, and take the kids with us and we would let the kids do a 
lot of the soccer s Œ stuff 
for them, you know, to teach 
them how to handle a soccer 
ball, how to Œ how to balance 
a soccer ball, how to juggle a soccer ball. And we als Œ 
also helped them to buy equipment, soccer e
quipment. We went into
 that business, the 
two of us, for awhile. So that™s
 another pleasu re that I have. This year I was selected Œ 
elected to the soccer Hall of Fame, State of 
Indiana. 
I have numb er of trophies which 
I received from my job as a soccer person, as
 a soccer coach and a so ccer referee, 
number of citation. Oh, there is a humanita
rian award named after me also, I don™t 
know if I showed it to you or not, but ther
e is one. It™s hanging at one of th Œ the 
largest school Œ the larger hi
gh school in the state of
 Indiana
 called North Central 
High School. This just called the 
Mike Vogel™s 
Humanitarian award. Every year a 
person is added to that award, which is hang
ing at the school. I have a copy of Œ a Œ a 
small replica of the award here at home, an
d that was given to me three years ago fo r 
soccer and other humanitari
an things that I do.

Q: What are the other things that you do th at
 you™ve gotten involved  with in  terms of f 
Œ philanthropic activities or Œ or Œ 
A: Just lectu Œ mo stly lecturing, 
speaking, and of course last May 24
th
, I was given the 
honorary doctorate de-degree of
 public service at one of th
e f-fine university of state of 
Indiana
 called 
DePauw 
University, wh ich was given 
to me at the graduation 
commencement May 24
th
. That was a nice one. Last year 
I was selected in the state of 
Indiana
 for the 
Jefferson
 Award. The 
Jefferson
 Aw ard was founded by 
Robert Taft, 
Jr., Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis 
and a guy named
 Sam Bea rd
 whose father was a 
congressman at one time. The 
Jefferson 
Award is given to people who Œ ev -every 
state Œ this is Œ th
is is nationwide Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Œ who do volunteer work, like speakin
g and helping the children and teaching 
children and doing li Œ working with homeless 
and so on. Each state select s thei r own. 
There was 127 people nom
inated from the state of
 Indiana
, only 10 are 
selected for 
the na Œ fo r the 
Jefferson
 Award, and then there is a lu
ncheon at the hotel here in 
town, and the 10 people that were the winn
ers of the Œ from the 127 and th eir families 
and friends, they all come to the lunch, 
and you have a sponsor. I was sponsored  by 
ﬁThe
 
Indianapolis Star News.ﬂ 
And th is year Œ last year th
ey gave, for the first time, 
a 500 dollar money to be give
n to your charit Œ favorite 
charity. My money was given 
to the Holocaust Museum in 
Wash ington, 
my  500 dollars. And from the 10 people, 
each state selects one person to represent the state in 
Washington, D.C. 
So now you 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007

won the national award. You come to the nati
onal award for three days and you stay in 
Washin gton
 at a beautiful hotel. You are allowed 
to bring one guest,
 in my case I 
brought my wife. And then there are two ga
la dinners and lunches, and you meet the 
other people and everyone talks about wh at 
he did. You give Œ 
first evening you get 
two minutes to say how did you co me to gi
ven Œ be given this 
en Œ honor. Then the 
gala dinner is held on Tuesda
y nights and this dot Œ this ye
ar was Œ last year was held 
at the women™s mu seum in arts, and it™s a beautiful, beautiful dinner, a dress up dinner 
with all sorts of dignitaries there, and co
ngressmen, sen ators. This
 dinner was funded 
by 
Heinz 
comp any, h Œ 
Heinz
 57. And the guests are first asked to come down, e-each 
given a number of table where you are sitting and we were asked to sit at a front table. 

And when we got there and my wife Œ a
nd the guests go down  first. Then  they  
announce us one by one, alphabetically or
der and you shake hands with all these 
dignitaries. And wh en you come to your table 
Œ when  I got to my  table the president of 

the 
Jefferson 
Awards, 
Sam Beard
 comes up to me and he says, after dinner I would 
like to speak to you. Well, I 
didn™t know what he wanted, 
so little nervous about it, but 
anyway, dinner was over, we come to the 
hotel and he™s talki
ng to me. He say s, 
tomorrow morning we™re going to the 
United States
 Supreme Court and I want you to  
be the closing sp eaker. I™ll give you three mi
nutes to speak. I got a little nervous. I told 
my  wife, what am I gonna tell them? She sa
ys, why don™t you jot something down? I 
said, you know how I am with writing. Wh at
 am I gonna Œ you know, I don™t want to 
tell them ab out the Holocaust 
too much. So I started writi
ng but I threw it away. Next 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
101
mo rning we go to th e 
United States
 Supreme Court. 
Sandra  Day O™Co nn or 
opened 
our session. And 
Sa m Bea rd
 was going to  introduce me to speak. I was fol Œ I 
followed 
Sam Nunn,
 the guy who was Œ was Œ founded 
C-Span
 and  
Julian Bond
, 
you know who he
 is? Okay, and 
Rosa lynn Carter. 
And I followed 
Ro sa ly nn Ca rter 
Œ Rosalynn Carter, 
the pr Œ former Presid ent 
Carter™s 
wife. So I gave them a three 
minute speech. That was the greatest honor 
I could Œ anybody co
uld bestow on me, 
speaking at the 
United States
 Supreme Court. 
Q: It™s a lo ng way from Œ from the 
K 
rations at the Œ 
A: Well, it was long way from
 Slovakia
. And I told them, 50 y
ears ago I arrived to 
this beautiful free country called 
United States
 
of America
 from the ashes of 
Auschwitz
 to life. My parents, my  grandparents,
 my  two brothers, my  two sisters all 
perished, all de Œ mu rdered, gassed and burned
 in the largest death factory of all Nazi 
concen tration camp. Yet today, I have a mi
ssion. My  mission is to speak for the six 
million who cannot speak for themselves. T oda
y I speak at colleges, universities, high 
schools, civic and religious organization. No t 
everyone is an anti-Se
mite in the world. 
Not everyone is a 
Kurt Waldheim
, 
Marge Schott. 
Yet, look at me, 
Mike Miso 
Vogel
, Jewish boy born in 
a small village of 
Slovakia
, sp eaking to you in th is great 
place called 
United States
 Supreme Court of 
America
. I thank you for this honor. 
That was my speech. I Œ I mi
ssed a couple lines, but that
 was my speech. And I tell 
you, my wife tells me that everybody crie
d. So , that was the honor. I had a beautiful 
speech also at 
DePauw 
University. I mise Œ I got 
it here to show you, but Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
102
Q: I Œ I know we™ve been doin
g this for awhile, I Œ I Œ trying to fo cus on the Œ the few 
last questions that Œ that I want to make sure
 to Œ to fit in here. Many of the things I 
wanted to  ask you you™ve alre
 Œ we™ve already talked about 
just in the natural flow of 
our co nversation. I™m just looking through 
the list here. T alked about that. There Œ 

there™s some Œ some questions that they™re aski
ng everyone just to Œ 
to sort of see what 
the similar experiences of other survivors have
 been, so this is a very general question 
and I mean you Œ you™ve t
ouched on th is in many ways, 
but can you talk about the 
long term impact that your experiences dur
ing the Ho locaust have had on you? That™s 
a Œ that™s a tough Œ I think it™s a pretty enor
mous question. It™s Œ it Œ for example, we 
talked about in your family and raising y
our ch ildren. How about 
in terms of trust, 
your ability to trust people? 

A: Well, it Œ that took awhile also. That to
ok Œ took quite awhile before I Œ befo re I 
believed or trusted, cause you 
know, that was not an easy part for me to do. Ho w could 
you trust after you went through wh at we we
nt through? How could you have faith in 
so-someone, you know, in some
one™s wo rd, but you didn™t, you know Œ here in this 

country, th-the 
BS 
system gets Œ gets Œ gets in th
e way, you know, 
and people tell Œ 
tells Œ tell tales. Yet, I had 
a hard  Œ I had a hard time with
 trusting. I trusted my  wife 
and children, but I was afraid to trust someone else. So that took a long time. Today I 

can tell by a person™s handshak e. When  the g
uy lo oks in your eyes when  he shakes 
your hand and he shakes it like he means it,
 n o t like a dead fish
, you can almost say 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
103
that here is a guy who is ha
lfway decent and honest. So  I had a hard  time with trusting. 
Faith and trust was a hard thing for me, hard thing. 
Q: What about just 
being with Gentiles? 
A: No problem, none whatsoev er. None wh
atsoever. I-I have a tremendous sense of 
humor, I tell jokes about ra Œ not racial, I™m ta
lking about ethnic jokes, to me that™s Œ I 

tell them all the time. But I ha
ve no problem with Gentiles. 
Q: But I meant when  you first Œ whe-
wh en  you first came over, were you Œ 
A: Oh, when I first came ove
r? Well, I first came over to 
Detroit
, we lived in a Jewish 
neighborhood. So only 
Gentiles I met was in the busine
ss world, wa Œ you know, in 
the store that I worked in. So I didn™t have
 too mu ch outside of my  busin ess life to do 
with the Gentiles. But now, today, I have no
 problem with them. I 
Œ I work with them, 
I Œ I play soccer with them, against them, 
an d they all respect me, I respect them. I 
have no problem whatsoever.  

Q: I was just wondering 
if that took awhile Œ 
A: No, no Œ 
Q: Œ to develop? 

A: Œ no, no, not in this 
country, not at all.  
Q: I know you™ve traveled back to  
Europe
 for different reasons 
and I know you went 
to your wife™s hometown. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Have you been  back  to 
Slovakia
? 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
104
A: I have no desire, none whatsoever. I don™t want ever to step in that Slovakian town 
that I came from. And people tell me I™m craz
y, that I should do it, I should see what 
it™s going on. A friend of mine 
who just gave me the book I 
told you abou
t, he just 
came from there. It was just 
before Œ when we got to 
Israel
 he Œ day befo re we got 
there he got home from there. And it used to
 be a 14,000 dollar Œ 14,000 population is 
now 40,0 00. And he said there are no Jews th
ere, of course, and th-there are no Jews 
left in 
Slovakia, 
I mean sla Œ any Jew who would live 
there would be crazy. But I have 
no desire to go there, no. I went to 
Prague
, but not Œ not to 
Slovakia
. I went to the 
Czech Republic
 which was then still 
Czechoslovakia
, but I have no desire. I don™t 
want to see a Slovak. I understand your mo m comes from that world, but Œ 
Q: She™s not born there. That™s her Œ 
A: Yeah, that™s her ma Œ  

Q: Her ancestors, yeah. 
A: Œ her parents, yeah. 
Q: Are there sounds or smells that
 evoke past experiences for you? 
A: None. 

Q: No, okay. 
A: Noth ing. 
Q: You™re walking down th e stre
et and there™s something, boom. 
A: No, ba Œ something 
burning? No , nothing.  

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
105
Q: A few more historical thi
ngs that Œ we talked about 
Vietnam
, we talked about 
Eichmann™s 
trial, we talked about Œ what about the 
McCarthy
 era? 
A: Well, let me tell you. Then I was such 
a strong American believer, so strong anti-
communist, cause I knew what that was, co
mmunism, that I almo st went along with 
that Œ that program and Œ and Œ almo st. Bu
t then, of course, when I heard the way 
Joe 
McCarthy
 was handling th e Œ it was on Œ televised 
in those days, you 
know, and I just 
couldn™t Œ th is guy was a hate monger. And 
I considered  him worse than the Nazis 
after I™ve se Œ after I seen him for awhile. At
 first I said, he™s fi
ghting communists, it™s 
good. 
Hoover 
is fighting co mmunists too, that™s goo
d. But neither one of these guys 
were good a Œ good Americ
ans, so to speak, because they  were hate mongers.
 Hoover
, 
what did he do? He went after the 
wrong people all the time, you know.
 Ma rtin  
Luther King
. What did he want from 
Martin Luth er King
? Here was a ma n who 
was a peaceful demonstrator. He pi Œ th Œ he
 th Œ he never wanted  to throw a rock on 
anybody, he didn™t do any of that
, he was very peaceful. He 
put him to jail, he put him 
to jail, and he was nicely quiet, with hi
s good voice, telling th
e world what it™s all 
about. 
McCarthy
 was just as bad as the Nazis. He went after people whom he 
consider Œ whom he Œ whom 
he accused of being a communist. He took so many lives 
away from people Œ so many livelihoods away  
from people in Œ in Œ in those years. He 
was the Œ one of the worst th
ing Œ he was an animal.  
Q: Did it frighten you at all?
 I understand that you were su
pportive of the Œ the Œ the 
larger aims and the Œ were a good anti-comm
unist, but w-were you frightened  at all to 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
106
see Œ I mean, there were some similarities 
it Œ it seems, in retrospect with the 
techniques used to accuse people and Œ 
and you know, neighbor
s against neighbors 
and Œ 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Œ people turning 
each other in, and Œ 
A: Mm-hm, yup, yup. I™d w Œ it frighten
ed me, because it was similar like what 
happened  Œ here Œ here is a Jew living, he
re is a Œ you know, th
ey™re Œ they™re telling 
on people, or how to  catch people, telling on 
your neig hbors to save your own skin.  
Q: Oh, we™ll let you go if you tell abou
t all the other people in your club. 
A: Yeah, well, that™s right. We™ll Œ we
™ll Œ well, your okay, but you tell me e-
everything about the other peop
le and your Œ your
 Œ you™re a free man. And that™s Œ 
that™s what McCarthyism was. 

Q: Did you know anybody that got ga Œ ca
ught up in that, was a victim of that? 
A: No, not really. I knew
 Œ I knew  someone in 
Bing hamton, New Yo rk
 when  we 
lived there that he was falsely accused Œ sh e 
was falsely accused. She went once to a Œ 
a communist me eting with her Œ one of her 
friends and they accused her of being a 
memb er. This was during the 
McCarthy
 era. But of course did Œ nothing happened to 
her. And he Œ her husb
and was working for
 GE 
at the time as an engineer and they 
could have gotten in  trou
ble, you know, he could have lost his job. 
Q: I was just wondering because th ere we
re a disproportionate number of Jews 
involved, Jews in the Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
107
A: Lot of Jews involved. 
Q: Œ labor Œ 

A: Labor and actors, and Œ 
Q: Œ and Œ and academia. 
A: Œ academia, yeah. 

Q: And so many Œ it seemed like if you were 
involved  with any sort of Jewish youth 
group in the 30™s Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ well, that was enough reason to be. 

A: It was the Œ the 
Workmen
 Society was another one, Jewish group, 
Workmen
 
Society and they all called th
em communists, because it™s a 
Workmen
 Society. 
Q: You were too old 
to be drafted for 
Korea, 
correct? 
A: Yes, yes.  
Q: You Œ you Œ 
A: Well actually I wasn™t. No, I wasn™t.  

Q: Yeah, I was thinking you would 
have been  just in the Œ the Œ 
A: In the 20™s. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, I wasn™t. I was in the 20™s. 

Q: Mm-hm. Did you Œ we Œ you Œ you mentioned 
Martin Luther King
 earlier, with 
some Œ clearly someone that you re Œ had resp ect for. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
108
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Tal Œ let™s talk a little bit about the Œ th
e Civil Rights movement in this country, the 
Œ for blacks that were looking to Œ 
A: Mm-hm. See, when I came 
to this country, there was 
still lynching in the south, 
okay? In the 40™s and 50™s it was Œ late 40™s,
 it was still Œ you could still Œ there was 
some lynching in th e south, and we couldn™t
 understand it. When we Œ when  we move 
Œ when I first met my wife in 
Detroit
, went to look for an ap
artment in the apartment 
build ing, there was a sign, 
no Jews, no dogs, no niggers
. Now this is coming from 
Auschwitz
 to si Œ to this, right? Now, let™s go
 to the Civil Right movements. I never 
marched with them, okay, never went with 
them anywhere, but I was very much for 
those people, very much so. Th
e demonstration, the burning,
 the si Œ the big cities like
 
Detroit 
was burning, 
Los Angeles 
was burning. I was against that, that part bothered 
me. What were they burning?
 They were burning their ow
n neighborhoods. That was 
the worst part, you see, that part was wro
ng on th em. But wh a Œ wh at e Œ wh at else 
were they doing? They were l
ooting. See, that was wrong Œ 
wrong, too. See, they went 
the wrong way. They were afraid to go to 
the better neighborhoods, but they  went to 
their own ne Œ they burned their own ne
ighborhood, burned th
eir own houses down, 
burned their own storekeepers down. So Œ 
but I tell you, racism and anti-Semitism 
unfortunately, unless the whole world will cha
nge, as Œ and it™s gonna take awhile, the 
whole 
United States
 will change, it will stay with us. 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
109
Q: What would you i Œ if it were in your 
power to engineer how things were done, 
let™s just say in this country
, not even the world, where 
would you start to Œ to stop 
anti-Semitism and racism? 
A: Now, or then? 
Q: Now. 

A: Now? 

Q: If you were starting Œ if now they said, 
Mike Vogel
, you™re in charge of 
Indianapolis
 and how we™re gonna do things 
from now on, wh -where would you 
start? 

A: I would show them what racism and an
ti-Semitism can do to 
a folk Œ can do to 
people. I would tell them about it. What can
 happen when Œ wh en  anti-Semitism and 
racism flourishes. That people are being 
mu rdered, people are being depriv ed of 
freedom, people are being deprived of that. If th
is is the kind of world we want in the 
United States
, this is not what we need. What we 
need is education. We need people Œ 
better schools, we need to teach people abou
t indifference, we ne
ed te Œ teach people 
about all of us are equal and that™s what we
 should do. As a surv
ivor I™m speaking to 
you today that racism, anti-Semitism s
hould be abolished an
-and quickly.  
Q: It™s not an act of Congress though, that you can Œ 

A: Unfortunately, it™s not an act of Congre
ss, yeah. And we have some people there in 
the Congress that are Œ that are anti-Semites or
 Œ or racists. They try to be nice, but 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
110
they™re Œ they™re Œ they™re Œ ri
ght down Œ deep down  they™re
 Œ they™re Œ they™re racists 
and anti-Semites.  
Q: Are there any people Œ let™s see, how ca
n I ask the question. Have there been a-any 
p-political leaders or individuals in Œ in the Œ in the intervening 50 years, other than 

McCarthy
 who we talked about, that you were 
particularly worried about, or that Œ 
fearful about, or that Œ 
that you thought were Œ 
A: Oh, during th e 
Demjanjuk 
trial in 
Israel
, there was a cup Œ there was a guy from 
Ohio
, can™t think of his na
me, a congressman from 
Ohio
, but he was an anti-Semite 
and he didn™t m- mince word s about it. Another one is 
Pat Buchanan 
is Œ is the one 
that I fear a lot. And I don™t know why he 
always ends up getting th e same job back  on 
CNN
 on Œ on Œ in same program he gets on. He
 is another guy that I™m deathly afraid 
of that if he ever gets any power, what 
he could do. He is a clear anti-Semite who 
denies the Holocaust very
 much. Him and his sister. A nd one of the actors, 
Marlon 
Brando.
 
Ma rlo n  Brand o
 was on th e lar Œ
 Larry King
 show last year, before I went 
to the 
Jefferson 
awards. And he said 
Hollywood
 is controlled by Jews, and if you 
don™t go through the Jews, 
you don™t get anywhere in 
Hollywood. 
Now look at him, 
he has made millions in 
Hollywood
, and if 
Hollywo od
 controlled the Jews, they 
certainly helped him. 

Q: What in particular
 concerns you about 
Pat Buchanan
, for example, what™s your 
fear that Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
111
A: 
Pat Buchanan
, his politics. He sounds like an an
ti anybo Œ anti-all Œ all an Œ he™s 
an anti-Semite, anti-race. And he™s 
the one who protec
ted and defended 
Demjanjuk
 
through the government, 
OSI, 
Office of Special Investiga
tion had th e wrong man, as 
far as being
 Demjanjuk
, but did not have th e wrong man 
as far as being a former Nazi 
guard . He was.

Beginn ing Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with 
Michael Vogel. 
This is tape number four, side
 A,
 and we are finishing up the 
interview with a last coup
le of questions and you were in the midst of Œ 
A: 
Pat
 
Buchanan? 
Q: Œ yeah , and th Œ you mentioned the 
Demjanjuk
 Œ 
A: 
Demjanjuk
 was the guy who was called th Œ th-t
he Œ th e Œ them Œ the Œ they Œ the 
Œ 
Ivan
 the Terrible. 
Q: Right. 
A: You know, it was Œ 
Q: 
Treblinka
? 
A: Œ 
Demjanjuk
, yeah. He was one of the Œ he was a Œ supposed ly in 
Treblinka
. But 
it ended a Œ it turned out he was not in 
Treblinka
. He was not 
Ivan 
the Terrible. He 
was a ca-camp guard, a Nazi camp guard in 
Sobibor 
and two mo re other camp s. They 
also got the wrong in formati
on about him. He came to 
this country illegally, lying 
about his past. He committed crime against 
humanity and he should 
be punished for it, 
but he wasn™t. Oh, he was punished, he
 was a year and a half in prison in
 Israel.
 
Pat 
Buchanan
 was very much against 
the Holocaust. The people 
do  n o t reme mb er wh at 
happened. The people 
identified him wrongly and he wa
s never a Nazi. He was a poor 
Ukrainian who came 
Œ emigrated to 
America
, went to work in a 
Cleveland 
automobile factory, where he made a damn
 good living and never revealed his past.
 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
113
Demjanjuk
 was a Nazi, and he™s living in  
Cleveland, 
maybe not as comfortably as 
he™d like to today because of a
ll that had happened to him, 
but he™s still there, free man 
and his children think he™s th
e greatest thing on tw o feet.  
Q: I™m Œ I™m winding down here. 
A: All right.  

Q: Did you Œ ho-how would 
you say you were Œ have 
Œ okay, how can I Œ we™v e 
talked about that. Does a day go by Œ I 
know now you™re rather involved with Œ and 
speak about Œ an-and you™ve got many books
 and Œ an d correspondences with other 
survivors and with academics and writers a
nd whatnot. Prior to this time, do many 

days go by that you™re not 
reminded of your experience? 
A: Unfo rtunately not. 
Auschwitz
 always comes up, always
, every day, somehow or 
other Œ so me Œ some Œ somewhere or othe
r. You know, especially since the Swiss 
situation happened, I was aske
d Œ in fact, I was written up in the paper about the Swiss 
ca Œ Swiss monies, gold money. Well, it Œ it Œ it got so that every day I was being 

called by someone in th e Œ in th e media, just
 about. And I must te
ll you this, that I 
certainly didn™t know about 
the Sw iss money. Didn™t kn
ow about the Swiss gold. I 
knew about the gold that was yanked out of 
the Jewish teeth. I knew about the money 
that was confiscated from the 
Jews when they arrived to 
Auschwitz
, but I certainly 
didn™t know that it went to 
Switzerland
. There are gold bars in 
Switzerland 
with Œ 
with a swastika on it and Œ in Œ in Œ in 
Switzerland
, in Swiss banks. It came from 
Auschwitz
 and other camp s, that it was yanked ou
t of teeth that they were gassing. So 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
114
never a day goes by without something ha
ppening, something 
somebody mention Œ 
mentions 
Auschwitz
 to me, or somebody comes up to
 me and asks me something 
about it. Unfortunately that
™s part of my life.  
Q: Do you ever wish that you co uld just
 say, you know, I™m going on vacation from 
this? 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: You know, I Œ for the next Œ 
A: There are times. 
Q: Œ for the next Œ 

A: There are times that I say, hey listen, not
 today, okay? You want to see me, come to 
hear me speak someplace else
, but leave me Œ let me eat 
my lunch. But you know, it 
never happens. Some guy went up to me
, oh I seen you in the paper about the 

Jefferson 
award. I™ve seen you in the paper abou
t a Œ about the docto rate degree you 
received at 
DePauw
. And it™s Œ it™s always starts a
nd you Œ you know, I™m Œ I™m the Œ 
I™m a people™s person so I Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t want
 to be rude to anyone, so I gave them a 
couple of minutes and that™s it. But there are 
times I say, listen, not today, please. Let™s 
Œ let™s talk about it some other time. 
Q: You Œ you talked  about how you ended up
 speaking about your experiences to your 
children and Œ and how you wi
shed you™d handled  that differently. Now you have 
grandchildren. What co nversations have y
ou had with your grandchildren and how has 

Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
115
A: Much more th
an my children. 
Q: And it Œ 
A: Much more. 
Q: Why don™t you just talk maybe about on
e grandchild and Œ an
d how you™ve Œ came 
to talk with them about it. 
A: Well, first we have an o Œ grandchild th
at™s 21 years old now, she is Œ so she came  
to me and she has my  film. She came and 
brought the film to school, and she asks 
questions and I tell her. This grandchild know
s more than my child
ren ever did. Bu t I 
have the youngest grandchild
 and Œ I should say the 10 year old gran ddau ghter who 
came with us to 
Israel
 on this trip, and she was allowed to go to 
Yad Va shem.
 This 
kid stuck with me like glue wh ile I was 
speaking and she would 
not leave me fo r a 
mo ment, she was so tight next to  me, holding onto me. And after that, she says, 

Grandpa, that was very sad. The mu seum
 and also your speech. So  th Œ our 
grandchildren know mu ch, mu ch  mo re now th
an our kids ever knew. So th e 10 year 
old asked me to promise her when she is 
12 years old, she wants to hear the whole 

story. She says, by 12, I™m gon
na be better equipped to listen to it. And I will do it for 
her. Just before her 
Bar Mitzvah Œ 
her 
Bat Mitzvah. 
Q: Hm. We talked about that. 

A: Didn™t you finish yet? 

Q: Just about. Trust me. We talked about that, talked about that. We really talked 
about all the things I Œ 

USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 
 
 
 
116
A: We gotta do the corrections over there. 
Q: Yes, but that™s not something th
at need Œ need be done on tape. 
A: No, no? Okay . 
Q: You can just Œ we just need the co
rrect spelling of each of those names. 
A: Okay. All right. 
Q: The last question I was going to  ask you, 
I Œ I think I basically already asked you, 
and that™s how do we keep 
this from happening again? 
A: Teach the people. Let them read the hi
story books. Indifferenc
e. Indifference is a 
word that I started using with 
Elie Wiesel
. And that™s the word that is very important. 
Don™t look at me what I look lik
e, look at me what I am. An
d listen to me what I got to 
say.  
Q: Is there anything you would like to sa
y in closing that we haven™t touched on? 
A: No, I think Œ 
Q: Œ that you feel strongly about? 
A: Œ we Œ we covered just 
about everything, but I want 
to say something about the 
Holocaust Museum in 
Washington
. I respect this organization very, very much. The 
staff at the 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum, wh
om I respect an awful lot. 
Everyone th at I ever was in touch w
ith, in contact with. These people are 
professionals. And I hope when the day co
mes that there no longer will be any 
survivors, that these people at the 
Holocaust Museum will carry on, so 
Auschwitz
 will

not become a legend. I want to thank th em 
for all that they have done. Thank you, 
Holocaust Museum. 
Q: Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
 Vogel.
 This concludes the 
United States
 Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with 
Michael Vogel 
on this 10
th
 day of July, 1997. 
Thank you.
