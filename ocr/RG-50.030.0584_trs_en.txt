tle bit about the worl
d that you came to

RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
4
A: And I was born in  a very small coal mining community in
 Silesia.
 The name of 
the community was 
La zy , l-a - z-y .  
And at the age of five, we moved to another small 
coal mining community, and Œ by the name 
Poru ba, p-o-r-u-b-a. 
Q: And what country  was this? 
A: 
Czechoslovakia
. 
Q: Was this north  of 
Prague, 
south of
 Prague
? 
A: It was closer to the Polish border. 

Q: I see, I see. And do you Œ 
A: The closest large city was 
Ostrava
. 
Q: I see. O h , yeah. And what was your first language? 

A: My first language was Czech. My pa
rents spoke Czech and German, so I was 
exposed to the German language also. Alth
ough people in the community , the coal 
miners, spoke their own language, which 
was a mixture of Czech and so me Polish 
and my  father really didn™t want us to
 speak it. My mother
 spoke because my 
parents had the general store, and the cust
omers spoke Œ sp oke this language. So my  
mother could easily speak with
 them, but my father refu
sed, and we had to sp eak 
pure Czech. 
Q: Well, it sounds like it was like 
a local patois, a local lingo. 
A: Dialect, yeah. 
Q: Yes. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
5
A: Right. And Œ 
Q: Did you have brothers and sisters? 

A: I had a brother, two year Œ two 
years old Œ young Œ younger brother, 
Erik, e-r-i-
k.
 As I said before, my  parents had the general store. By the standard of the 
community, we were very well-to-do, but we 
were really not wealthy. We just Œ we 
lived on the main stre
et, the street didn™t have a name
, it Œ it was just a main street. 
On one side of our home was a baker, 
on th e other side was a butcher. And we 
didn™t have very mu ch to do with the but
ch er, but the butcher™s daughter was my 
closest friend. 

Q: Were they Jewish, too? 

A: No. I had no Jewish fr-friends at all at this time. 
Q: Was there a Jewish co
mmunity in this town? 
A: There was a Jewish  community, not in 
Poruba
 where we lived, but in a little bit 
larger community called 
Orlova, o-r-l-o-v-a, Orlova. 
And th ere was a beautiful 
synagogue and there was a large Jewish 
co mmu n ity . In  my  immed i ate co mmu n ity , 
only my  grandfather, with his two daughte
r, who were n Œ daugh
ters who were not 
married yet, they also had two general stores. 
Icar
(ph), the neighbor™s Œ the baker™s 
daughter was my closest friend, and we ar
e still friends. Actually
 I spoke to her a 
few Œ few days ago. 
Q: That™s nice. That™s very nice th
at something can last so many decades. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
6
A: So many decades, and so many different
 times when we didn™t know about each 
other. Wh ere she didn™t Œ where sh Œ where 
she was afraid to have anything to do 
with me, under communists, you know, so Œ 
Q: Yes. So tell me a little bit, how is it th
at your parents Œ your family came to be in 
this small coal mining town ? Ho w many Œ were
 they new to it, wer Œ had they been 
there for generations? 

A: No, no, they lived 
there for a long time, my grandp
arents lived there for a long 
time. And as I said, nearby wa
s a larger Jewish community. 
Q: What Œ what do you kno
w of your family histor
y that your parents and 
grandparents might have told you about? 

A: My Œ I was very close to 
my mother™s father, to my gr
andfather, because he lived 
in the same community. And my
 mo ther was the oldest of 
six girls, and one son. I 
was always told that my mo ther was the most 
intelligent of the si
x, although each 
one was very talented, each one
 had the special talent; musi
c, painting, piano. Each 
one was very talented. Bu
t my mother liked
 books, and my  
father was from 
Moravia
 and he was very proud 
that he was born near the place wh ere the beloved 
President 
Masa ryk
 was born. 
Q: Ah yes, ah, yes. 

A: And Œ 

Q: What was that place? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
7
A: The name when he was born was called 
Strážnice Œ
 actually, 
Javornik
. It™s 
rights here too. 
Q: Hang on a second. Uh-h uh, 
Javnice
(ph)

A: 
Javornik

Q: Yeah. Exactly. And his name was 
Rudolf? 
A:

Q: And Œ and what was 
your mo ther™s name? 
A: And my mo ther was Œ her name was 
Iren a
. 
Q: That™s my mother™s name, too. 
A: Yes? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
Irena Œ 

A: 
Irena Kornfeldova
(ph). 
Q: 
Kornfeldova
(ph), uh-huh. And she was born in
 Poruba
? 
A: She was born in
 Poruba
, right. And Œ 
Q: Did your father
 attend university? 
A: My father did not attend university, no. 

Q: Was he a businessman? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
8
A: He was a businessman, he was trained in 
Vienna
 in busin ess, and my  mo th er was 
much more interested in lite
rature and Œ and e
ducation, although 
my father Œ also, 
both our parents were very, very  concerne
d about our in Œ our ed ucation. An d I 
reme mb er my  mo th er was d r eami n g  to  sen d  u s to
 Switzerland
 to get the good educa 
Œ rounded education. 
Q: How did they meet? 

A: I was told only few years ago, wh
en I went to visit my cousin in 
Jerusalem
, w h o  
adored  my  parents, she told 
me that they met through a 
traveling salesman. And then 
they fell in Œ I was told they fell in
 love with each other™s handwriting. 
Q: That™s very romantic. 

A: And my father Œ both my parents were
 in the Œ wonderful people. I have never 
seen anybody co me of our home empty ha
nded. Gypsies, who people resented and 
were afraid of, my parents always load
ed with clothes and fo od and Œ and my  
mother all the Œ always taught me, give, and it will be given to you. Wish, and it will 
be wished  out to you. 
Q: Has it Œ has it fulfilled itself, th is thing Œ 

A: In most ways. 
Q: Yeah? 
A: Yes. But, as you know, with  the fate th
ey faced, life was not really as great and 
people were not as great, always. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
9
Q: Yeah. We™ll come  to that mo ment
. What are your earliest me mories? 
A: So, my earliest memories o-of my parent
s are Mother sitting at the end of the day 
on th e stove in the kitchen, after we went
 to bed, and wh en I went back to th e 
kitchen, always she was sitti
ng on the stove reading books. 
Q: Did she work  in the store? 

A: Yes, both my parents work in the st
ore, and we had a housekeeper, live-in 
housekeeper always. And th e people in 
the community were 
wonderful people, 
honest people. And only wh en I came back 
after the war, I reali
zed how much they 
loved and admired my  parents. Only wh en
 I came back I really appreciated it. 
Q: How Œ th at™s Œ how did that show itself? 

A: I will talk Œ tell you at the Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ end when we came 
back what happened. 
Q: Okay , okay. And wh at are your Œ that Œ so your earliest me mo ry of your mo th er 
is sitting that Œ is that she™s s
itting on the stove reading a book. 
A: Right, always reading. And my  father
 was mo re outdoorsy . Both of my  parents 
were very people oriented. Both  loved peop
le and people loved them, both of them. 
But my mother was quieter. As I said, inte
lligent, thoughtful. My
 father was more 
outdoorsy. He loved gardening and this I in
herited from him. Also
, my  memo ri es are 
of my  mo ther singing a lot, and she sang 
a lot of Germans songs, operettas and Œ and 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
10
I still remember them so we
ll. Although, she sang nicely and I cannot carry the tune. 
And m Œ as Œ my  best friend was 
Icar
(ph) and we read th e same books and we 
played with our dolls, and th
ey had the double seat swi
ng in the gard en , two seats 
facing each other. And when  we later move
d into our home, I bought a swing like 
this, just because of the memories.  
Q: So, what year were you born in? 

A: I
 
was born in 1928, December tw
ent Œ 1928. And my  brother 
Erik
 was born two 
years and tw o months later.  

Q: So th e years that you grew up were th
e 1930s, and you Œ and you grew up then, I 
would say in  a Œ in a small town, small pl
ace, near Œ near the Polish border. And did 
political events make th
emselves felt at all? 
A: Only in 1938 

Q: What happened? 

A: I never Œ I have to  tell you that I ne
ver, ever heard th e word anti-Semitism. 
Q: That was going to be one of my  questions. 

A: Never, never. I was the only Jew in spor
t, I was the only Jew in school. I never, 
never felt anti-Semitism, until I came to 
Poland
. 
Q: What happened th en , in the late Œ in 1938? Did Œ 

A: Let me just tell you that my  fondest me
mo ries are, on Sundays my  Œ my  mo th er™s 

sis-si ster,  t h e second oldest sist er,  which 
her mother was the closest, they had two 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
11
children, and one was six months younger than  my  brother 
Erik. 
And on Sundays 
my  father used to take the older son, 
Walter
, and 
Erik,
 and me for a walk, and we 
walked to the ponds. And 
my father made whistles fo
r us. In the meantime my 
mo ther cooked a very  delicious lunch. And 
from the ponds, either we went to the Œ 
to 
Orlova,
 to the nearest commun
ity Œ there was a wonderfu
l pastry shop, so my 
father bought pastries that we all like, especially my mother. Or we went to am Œ to 
a nursery. When they
 got Œ it was Mr. 
S-Slama
(ph). 
Slama
(ph) means straw. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I guess my love fo
r nurseries is since then. 
Q: Why are you Œ 

A: So Œ and then in the afternoon, we used
 to go to my  grandpa
, who had a Œ mo st of 
my mother™s sisters an d families came, and 
my grandpa pan Œ played cards with his 
sons-in-law, and we had our 
cousins and th e neighborhood ch ildren, and my  fa Œ my  

grandpa had the very  nice garden, and ma
ny mo re flowers than we had. And my  
father took care of my grandpa™s gard
en. And behind th e garden  was a brook. 
Q: Sounds ideal. 

A: And geese, and a little bridge to a mead
ow, and I loved to go to the meadows and 
pick Lilies of the Valleys, and Œ and fo
rget-me-nots. And it was very Œ a very 
pastoral setting behind my  grandpa. So 
m Œ then, in 1938, th
e Œ the Germans took
 
Sudetenland Œ 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
12
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and the Polish army  marched into our part of
 Silesia. 
And as Jews we had to 
vacate. I think they gave us a month to
 vacate. Now, to go in Œ deeper into 
Czechoslovakia
, there was no reason to go because 
Germans already occupied  part 
of it. So, we opted to go to 
Poland
 wh ere my grandfather had a brother, a wonderful 
man. And we Œ we went to a smaller community  near 
Kraków
, 
Poland
, and there 
we wanted to wait for the rest of the family
 because we Œ we knew
 that they all will 
have to eventually come. 

Q: What was the name of 
this community, this place? 
A: I-In? 

Q: Near 
Kraków. 
A: 
Prokocim, p-r-o-k-o-c-i-m, Proko Œ 
Q: So when you had to vacate, did th
at mean you had to  leave your store? 

A: We had to leave the store, the home, ev
erything. So I do not know, because I was 
not so interested in the arrangeme
nts, I was 10 years old in ™38, 
Erik
 was only eight 
when  my  parents made some kind of arrangement to give the house and the store. I 

don™t know if they rented it, or what the 
arrangement was, to some acquaintances of 
the baker™s family. My Œ my best friend™s family, with the understanding that if we 

come back, it will revert to us
. So we left practically everything. When we came to 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
13
Poland
, my Œ my father couldn™t speak Polis
h, none of us c
ould. Bu t we kids 
learned quite fast, my father
 never could learn Po lish. 
Q: Did you see Polish soldiers in 
Poruba
 before you left? 
A: No. 
Q: Did you have any contact Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ with anybody Polish at
 all w h en Œ when you still Œ 
A: When they occupied? No, 
it went very, very quickly.
 The army occupied and Œ 
very quickly. And my grandfat
her was gravely ill in this time. So I remember that 
they extended our stay, be
cause Grandpa was dying, so  we left after he died. 

Q: I see.  
A: In the beginning, in 
Poland
 Œ well, my  Œ  my  mo th er™s
 sister, I mentioned her, 
with the two children, they arrived. And my
 mother™s younger si
ster, whom I always 
adored, she married just Œ just shortly 
befo re the outbreak of the war. And sh e 
married somebody, an engineer from 
Ostrava
, the 
[indecipherable]
 city. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: And so we waited for them, and we lived  
together in a building I think we rented, 
an apartment. And for a few months, 
we were able to go to school, 
Erik
 and I, for a 
short time. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
14
Q: What was that like? 
A: Of course, the language was Polish. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So, it was not so easy. 
Q: What Œ what are your 
memories from that school? 
A: Not much .  
Q: Not much . 
A: Not much, because it was very short.  
Q: Did you reme mber saying goodbye to
 your best friend befo re leaving? 
A: Yeah, of course, you know, it was very 
sad to leave everything we loved. And 
then, in September ™39, 
Poland 
was occupied, and people were
 afraid of the Œ of the 
German army , and many people ran. Whatev
er Œ packed whatever they could carry 
with them, and ran away from 
the Œ away from the army .  

Q: Do you mean Jews
 and Poles as well? 
A: Yes, but mostly Jews were frightened
. So, we packed our belongings and my 
mother™s youngest sister, with
 her young husband, and my  fa
mily went on a run. We 
call it in Polish 
nowa
(ph) 
chechken
(ph), now on Œ on th e run.
 In the meantime, my 
mother™s other sister, the one with
 the two children, went back to 
Slovakia
, because
 
Slovakia
 was still at p eace at this time, a
nd he, her husband was Slovak, so they 
went to 
Slovakia
. And we went on the run with my
 mother™s cousin also. And it was 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
15
a terrible time, because the planes were co
ming, and we were so
 tired, carrying our 
belongings. When  the planes came we just hopped into some ditches, and I guess my  
parents had some money to buy food. Bu t it wa
s very hard for them 
to see us kids to 
walk and walk and walk and not having a place
 to rest or wash up
. So eventually my 
father decided to talk to a 
Polish Œ a farmer, and ask him 
to sell us two horses and a 
buggy.  

Q: And did he? 
A: And he did, because he thought, bette
r to get some money now, than if the 
Germans will come an d cos Œ confiscate this
, I™ll get nothing. So he sold us two 
horses. The horses became memb ers of our 
family. We just Œ we loved the horses. 
Q: How did you know that? Did your father sa
y that he was Œ that this is what the 
farmer told him? Or, you ju st supposed  that this is Œ he was Œ 

A: I don™t know.  

Q: You don™t. 
A: I don™t know, but I Œ my Œ my father 
ma Œ might have mentioned something. So 
after we bought the horses, it was much, 
much easier. We could rest, we could Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ just very different. 
Q: Do you know wh at di
rection you were going in ? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
16
A: Toward the Russian front
. And I remember that one 
time we were Œ we had to 
cross a river, and the horses got stuck in th
e river, and we had to unpack some of the 
load, and we had to ge
t up Œ out and push Œ 
Q: The buggy. 
A: Œ the buggy. Bu t we managed. And th
en , after Œ and I don™t know how Œ how 
long we were out around. I 
don™t know exac
tly how long 
[indecipherable]
. But 
again, my father convince anot
her farmer to take us to wo
rk for him. Then my father 
and my  uncle were work with th e horses on 
the field. My mo ther and my  aunt were 
whatever needs to be 
done around the house. 
Q: For someone who doesn™t speak 
Polish, he was very, very good. 
A: He was Œ he was good, he co uld commu nicate. And ma Œ my  mother could a 

little bit better with her Œ what she was talk
ing to the peasants Œ to the coal miners. 
And so the farmer took us, and 
Erik
 and I took care of the cows, and I learned very 
well how to milk cows. And again, I don™t 
know exactly how long
 we were there. 
And then the Germans occupied 
Poland
, and we decided, you know, let™s go back 
home. 
Q: Wa Œ wa Œ during this time you were 
with the Polish farmer
, did you have any 
interaction with them? Do you 
have any memories of them? 
A: I just Œ of the cows, of the fields Œ 

Q: Just of the cows. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
17
A: Œ of th e fields. But I have no id ea
 what the grown-ups were talking of. 
Q: Where did you sleep? 
A: I guess we had ro oms. I don™t have exac
 Œ exact recollection of this. I just 
remember the fields and sitting in and m
ilking the cows. And then we came home, 
and my  father couldn™t get any job. My 
uncle also, he was an engineer, but Jews 
couldn™t get easily job. So, the horses, 
Fuksa
(ph) an d
 Malutki
(ph) Œ 
Q: 
Fuksa
(ph) and 
Ma rlu t ki
(ph). 
A: 
Futka
(ph) Œ 
Ma lu tki
(ph) means a little o n e. And 
F uksa
(ph) was a beautiful 
horse. 
Ma lu tki
(ph) was the older hors Œ horse. But 
me Œ we adored  the horses. And 
so they were moving 
furniture and whatever people ne
ed ed to move, and that™s how 
they found money.  

Q: Money. 
A: And then , sudden ly Œ su
dden ly laws started appearing. Restrich Œ reks Œ 
restrictions. One day signs appeared, Jews 
cannot go to stores , Jews and dogs not 
allowed. 
Q: Can I interrupt just for a second? Y
ou returned home, but 
you didn™t get your 
store back? 
A: No, not home. Ho me to 
Poland
. When we went to this Œ 
Q: Home to Œ oh, I see, not Œ not Œ 
A: Œ not to the Czech re Œ  

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
18
Q: Not to  the 
Czech Republic Œ 
A: Œ no, no, home. 
Q: Œ you went back to Œ 

A: To via Œ to
 Prokocim . 
Q: Cro Œ 
Prokocim. 
A: Near 
Kraków. 
Q: Okay , mm-hm. 
A: Right, right. And, so signs started appear
ing. Next day, Jews were not allowed to 
go to places or Œ en-entertainment
, or swimming pools and movies. 
Q: And you saw these signs? 
A: The signs, yeah, every day we woke up
 to something new. 
Then  Jews were not 
allowed to use public trans
portation. And then  Jews were
 not allowed to use Œ to 
leave the community they
 lived in, even when 
grandparents Œ like in 
Baltimore 
we 
couldn™t visit the grandparents, because we couldn™t leave 
Silver Spring. 
And  th en  
finally Jews had to wear the bands, whic
h I am just making because I am supposed 
to be speaking in a church next week, and 
I lost my band with the blue star. White 
band with  blue star. Wh-When Œ and th en 
Jews Œ Jewish children were not allowed 
to go to school any more. And of course
, you know, th e Jewish professionals were 
not able to Œ to Œ to  practice their professi
ons. But, it was very difficult to see all my 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
19
friends going to  school, all 
my  friends going Œ being ab le
 to go on trains or buses, 
and Œ 
Q: And you couldn™t. 

A: Œ and Œ and we couldn™t.
 We went Œ w Œ I couldn
™t leave my community, I 
couldn™t go on a bus, I couldn™t go anywhere. 

Q: Did you notice any change in your
 parents and how their manner was? 
A: Frightened. I could Œ I could see the fear
 in them, I could see Œ and they  started Œ 
I heard Œ I heard them to debate, where 
can we, how can we escape, where can we 
go? And one Œ one day it was
 England
, next it was 
Bolivia, 
next time it was so me 
other country. Who will accept us? In the en d we were trapped in the worst possible 

place.  
Q: You had Czech 
citizenship, yes? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Czech-Slovak citizenship? 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Did th at matter by the Œ by th at point? 

A: I don™t Œ 
Q: No. 
A: Matters that we were Jews, that™s what mattered.  

Q: And why would you say it was the worst possible place? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
20
A: Because 
Poland
 was the worst possible place. One day I was walking with my  
brother, and my  cousin, who ha
d beautiful blonde hair. He
 was eight years old Œ he 
was nine Œ nine, close to 10, my  Œ 
Erik
 also, and I was 12. I was so proud at this 
time that I could wear the Œ the white band. 
I was Œ I felt so grown up. I can wear it, 
Erik
 cannot, he was not yet 10 years old. 
So one day we went
 for a walk and a 
Polish teenager approached
 us, lit a match, an d th
rew it into my cousin 
Walter™s
 
beautiful blonde hair. I felt so responsib le, 
I was the older Œ I was terrified. I put out 
the Œ the fire from his Œ and we ran home, 
and from this day on, I was terrified to 
wear this white band. 
Q: Was this the first time you sa
w an Œ you felt anti-Semitism fro m
 Poland Œ 
from 
Poles. 
A: That was Œ maybe one time before. I 
had the Ch ristian friend who took me to 
church once with her, and I heard so
me people making some anti-Semitic 
comments, and that was the fi
rst time. And then the first 
really shocking experience 
was when  men, age I think 16 to 65, if 
I recall it correctly, had to assemble on an 
assembly place somew h ere. My father and my
 uncle were in there and we all went 
with him, and we waited there all day. We
 brought him some food, and we didn™t 
know what™s going to happen. In the ev
ening they were 
loaded  on trucks and taking 
away. We had no idea where they went. I fo
rgot to tell also, that during the time 
when my father was worki
ng with the horses and moving furn iture, we had th e 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
21
neighbor, also in
 Poland
, a butcher neighbor. And he sugge
sted to my father and my 
uncle, they should go 
with him out of town to buy ille
gal meat, so he could sell it. 
And my father wanted so desperately for 
the family to have 
something to live on, 
that they agreed to do it. A
nd they went, first of all, they
 were supposed to wear the 
bands, which they didn™t
. They were not allowed 
to leave the community. 
Q: And they  did. 
A: And they did. Second Œ an
d thirdly, they were bringi
ng in illegal meat. So, there 
were dangers on so many side. When they
 Œ from the minute th
ey left until they 
came home, we were Œ this I remember so vivi
dly, we were so afraid for their lives. 
When  Œ 

Q: Had you seen anyone Œ I™m 
sorry to interrupt you Œ have
 you seen anyone at that 
point, mu rdered? Or had you seen any co
rpses, or had you heard an y stories? 
A: No, no, not at this time. No
t at this time. It was just th
is terrible fear that if h e 
would be caught, he would be shot. Ther
e™s no question, you kn
ow, this fear. S o , 
they went and when they we
re suppo Œ we knew approx
imately when they will be 
back, usually it was at night 
they were coming back . So 
we took turns waiting on the 
street to listen if they are coming, a
nd when  we heard the horses from far, it was 
such a relief. And they went 
Œ when they came home, they
 were s Œ frozen, literally. 
The people and the Œ and th e horses
, everything was frozen, everything. 
Q: So you meant Œ it was wint
ertime when they had done Œ 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
22
A: It was wintertime and when
 Œ  I reme mb er my  Œ  wh en my  mo th er was tak i n g my  
father™s socks off, it was all 
ice, all ice. It was a terrible time for them. Anyway, so 
my father was taken away on 
trucks, and we didn™t know 
when they w
ill come back, 
if they will come back. Few da
ys later, they did come back, 
and told us that they are 
work ing Œ I forgot also to s Œ to mention th
at when we came back after this running, 
we were put into ghetto
s. So we moved from 
Prokocim
 to 
Wieliczka
, which was a 
well known city in 
Poland
, to a ghetto. When my fath
er was taken to this Œ on 
trucks, and when  he came back, he said th
at they are working on the railroad tracks 
in 
Prokocim,
 where we used to live.
 So, they mu st have gotten permission to come 
on train, because otherw ise th
ey wen Œ would not have been able to  Œ to co me. So, 

one day th ey came home and they said
 that they heard that Jews from 
Wieliczka 
will be deported. It sounded 
sad, but we still didn™t know
 what deported means, and 
Œ 

Q: So they were able to co
me back and forth afterwards? 
A: In Œ right, in the evening.
 And th ey decided that first 
they have to save the kids, 
so first 
Erik
 and me. We couldn't go all toge
ther, because a big group would Œ 
Q: Be most Œ 
A: Œ be too dangerous. So they  decided on
e night, the kids are going, so we walked 
the whole night until at dawn we came to my
 father™s Œ to the railroad tracks where 
Father was work ing, and my  father hid us 
under a boxcar. He mu st have been sure 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
23
that this boxcar will not go anywhere. We 
were supposed to stay under the boxcar, 
not to move, not to talk, not to whisper, un
til e Œ the evening, when my father would 
take us out and take us into hiding. Well,
 I can, as a parent, I can imagine what it 
must have been for my  father having us 
under the boxcar, and my  brother was a very 
big rascal, so Œ very , very. And my  father 
came, they took us into
 hiding to a Po lish 
family. And the next day they we
nt to get Mo ther and my  Aunt 
Polly
. My mother 
decided th at she has still some things to 
put in order and th at nothing can happen  so 
fast. My aunt should go an
d she promised she will come 
the next day. My aunt, of 
course, didn't want to leave my mother, bu
t in the end my moth
er convinced her go, 
I am surely going to  come the next da
y. The following day was too late. They  
already Œ my  Œ my  father and uncle hear
d from some Germans w
ho were in charge 
and liked my father and my
 uncle that Jews from 
Wieliczka
 are already being 
loaded on trains. My
 uncle somehow managed to c
onvince the Germans to Œ to 
come with him and bring so me Œ some papers
 that Mother is need
ed to work in the 
kitchen on th e railroad tracks. But they went
 to the trains, but they  could not find 
her. Well, when we heard that Mother was 
taken, we were devastated, absolutely 
devastated. The only thing 
we thought, well, maybe she went to another camp, 
maybe the war will be over next we
ek, and we will see her again. 
Q: But this all was in 1939 - 1940? 
A: Yeah, that™s not Œ 1940 - ™41. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
24
Q: 1940 Œ ™41, mm-hm. 
A: 
[indecipherable] 
™41, into ™42. Into ™42.  
Q: So do you remember Œ ex
cuse me for emphasizing this
, but do you remember the 
date your mo ther was taken? 
A: It was summer. Summer of Œ the only date
 Œ well, I remember 
only one date, and 
I will talk about it. 
Q: Okay . So  this Œ so you know it was Œ 
A: So Œ 
Q: Œ summertime, and it 
was either 1940 or 19 Œ 
A: It was June or July. 

Q: Okay , June or July, ™40 or ™41? 
A: ™42. 
Q: ™42? 

A: Already. 
Q: Uh-huh, all right, so you had already been in 
Poland
 for a good many years, 
actually, you know, ™42 you™d been Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ from 1938, 
when the Poles 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, we went in a ghetto in, we™re not 
[indecipherable].
 And, so my Œ we were 
together, and my Œ we were 
hiding in three different places, one was Œ I don™t want 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
25
to talk so mu ch Œ one was on a roof and 
it was diagonally from a police statio n, and 
it was in the city where we us ed to live, so people knew 
us. So my  father and uncle 
used to come in the evening,
 take off their bands, and always watching at night so 
nobody would see them.  
Q: Were you like in the attic area? 
A: In the attic area. Another place was we 
were in a mai Œ  on a main street, then one 
night there was banging on the door, and 
we thought where somebody reported us, 
but it happened that it was an accident be
tw een a mo torcycle and a car, and they  
were calling for help, so they were ba
nging on the door. Bu
t everything was so 
frightening, because Œ and then , the thir
d place was the most unusual. The third 
place, the Germans who liked my father and 
my uncle, offered that we can hide in 
the storage room of the building wh ere th
e German and Polish offices Œ officers 
were, in the cellar. 

Q: These were German soldiers? 
A: N-N-No, German Œ I don™t think they 
were Nazis, they were German overseers 
on th e railroad tracks, and Œ 
Q: So th ey weren™t part of the Œ 
A: Œ officer Œ 
Q: Œ military, but they were
 part of the work force? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
26
A: They were not military, but they were Œ right, not military. Bu
t I don™t think that 
they were 
SS.
 I Œ they might have been. They  might
 have been, but I am not sure. So 
they offered we can hide in
 the cellar. The cellar, all th
at was in the cellar were 
crates, huge crates like from some machines
. And the entrance to this was from the 
front of th e building. No windows. No wi
ndows that Œ down  to
 the cellar. So, we 
didn™t know wh at weather was outside, we
 didn™t know anything. The only people 
that knew that we are there, were our Po
lish neighbors, former
 Polish neighbor and 
I™m also forgot-got to tell you th at my  parents were so desperate to get 
Erik
 and me 
out when there was so much f
ear that we™ll be deported, 
or whatever, that the Polish 
neighbors send once their son, 
in the early 20s to bring 
Erik
 and me to their house to 
hide. It was before we were hiding in th
e other places. Wer Œ he came, and we were 
sitting on the train,
 Erik
 and I already, with this Polis
h guy, when  I decided I™m not 
going anywhere with my  parent Œ without my  
parents. So I ran out of the train, of 
course, 
Erik
 a Œ behind me, and the guy behind me
, and my parents were very, very 
distraught that here Œ ag ain we are here in
 danger, that we didn™t go in to hiding. So, 
the only people that knew that we are hiding there were the Po lish family, and two 
priests from a nearby church . And once in aw
hile they used to 
bring something and 
hide in th e shrubs, soups, coffee, you know, 
in the shrubs. So, my par Œ my father or 

uncle took it out from under the shrubs at ni
ght. At night people were not wo rking in  
this building, you know. But Œ 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
27
Q: Tell me, the uncle, this was the husband of your Œ 
A: Of my mother™s Œ 

Q: Œ of you Œ 

A: Œ younger sist er.  
Q: Œ ya Œ sister, mm-hm. 
A: I adored both of them, but my  aunt was 
always my favorite aunt. So, we were Œ I 
don™t know again how long we
 were in this, but it was very frightening. We had 
some bottles to urinate in, in
 one of the crates, and every time we heard Œ and it was 
quite often Œ Po lish or Œ or Ge
rman voices in front, talking in front of the door, we 
jumped into the big crate, and we didn™t breathe. 

Q: I™m a little surprised th
at Po lish officers would have
 been allowed Œ you know, 
would have been cooperating 
with Œ with Germans, unle
ss they were Polish police, 
for example Œ 

A: Poli Œ 
Q: Œ who were working for Œ be
cause the military was Œ it was  
A: No, th ese were Polish construction wo rk ers. 
Q: Oh, I see, not military people. 
A: No, no, they were construction. They
 were people who are wo rk ing on the 
railroad tracks. 
Q: I see, okay. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
28
A: All the people in the building had so
mething to do with 
building the tracks. 
Q: I see, okay, okay. 
A: Fine. 

Q: All right. 
A: But still, Poles were very anti-Semitic
. If anybody would see my father going 
there at night, we would Œ we would ha
ve been  finished . The priests were 
wonderful, and they offered 
to do Aryan paper for us. And we decided maybe that 
would be another possibility to save ours
elf. So somehow my fa
ther and my uncle 
obtained some hair dyeing solu tion. My aunt
 had beautiful black 
hair, bu Œ sh e was a 
very pretty woman, very pretty woman. 
My father and my  uncle could have passed 
ano Œ as non-Jews. My uncle 
had blue eyes, blondish  hai
r. My father also didn™t 
have Jewish features, yo-you know. But 
Erik
 and I and my  aunt Œ so we decided, at 
least my aunt, when she dyes her hair, so it 
will be less risky. So
 they brought this 
solution, and I was Œ they went to  work , my  father and my  uncle, and I was pouring 

this solution in her Œ into 
her hair, and rubbing it in, and rubbing it in, and she Œ it 
didn™t do anything. She said put mo re, put
 more, put more. So I was pouring more 
and ru bbing in, and suddenly 
her hair was coming out in chunks. And sh  Œ I could 
see that she was ready to sc
ream in Œ you know, how pain
ful it was, and her hair was 
burned, her skull was burned. 
And here I was a 12 year old 
kid, 13 year old kid, and 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
29
I felt I did it to her, I did it to her. This 
Œ what could we do? Wh ere could I ask what 
to do, you know, to ask for help? We
 couldn™t Œ she couldn™t scream Œ 
Q: She was down in the ce Œ she 
was down in  the 
cellar with you? 
A: In the cellar, and we couldn™t Œ sh Œ sh
 Œ I could see the pain sh e was Œ she was 
really in excruciating pain. 
So, by the evening 
when they came back, her hair was 
gone, her beautiful hair was gone, and th
is was the end of Aryan paper. While we 
were there, we heard about a labor camp,Jewish labor camp, in
 walking distance 
actually, in 
Prokocim
. So, I think th e grow Œ grownup
s might have thought, well, 
it™s probably safer to surviv e in a ca Œ la
bor camp . Labor, it means work ing, so we 
will work, and the war will be
 probably Œ few months the war Œ war will be over. 
It™s surely safer than in th
e cellar, e-every moment was really fear, fear, fear. So we 
actually walked into th
e first labor camp.  
Q: The four of you Œ the five of you? 

A: The Œ the f Œ my  Œ five of us, the five of us. Let Œ 
Q: How did your aunt look? Excu se me, by th at point, did she wear a kerchief on her 
head? 

A: I Œ she mu st have some Œ somehow, ye
s, beca Œ but she wa
s really very, very 
beautiful wo man. So , when  we found Œ it wa
s scary to find ourselves behind fences, 
suddenly, not be Œ being trapped again, 
but we figured we will work, and I was 
working in the kitchen. 
I had to peel potatoes. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
30
Q: Not a bad job. 
A: No, not Œ not a bad job, 
but we had, I remember, seve
n buckets, big buckets to Œ 
to Œ of potatoes to peel, 
and there were big table with lots of potatoes, and the 
women were sitting around it,
 and everybody was grabbing the biggest potatoes, 
because it filled faster the buc
ket. We assumed that if we
 obey all the rules, we will 
live. The first Œ there was one room, it was 
a sewing room, and that was actually our 
meeting place where w Œ wife and husband, 
you know, the husban
d came to visit, 
the boyfriends came to visit, it was our
 Œ our community room. And one day we 
went sitting there in the even
ing when we heard terrible shots, and we froze, because 
we haven™t si-si Œ heard anything like it be
fore. Nobody moved, until in the mo rning 
we heard that nine people tried to escape
 through the fence, and they  were shot on 
the fence. The fence was, at this time, notelectrified. S o , that was the first shock. 

You better do what they tell you to do. 

Q: Or not do anything else. 
A: Anything else, right. 
Q: Did you see those nine people? 

A: I didn™t see them dead, no, but I knew th em and it was Œ it was Œ the whole camp  
was, for the next few days it was Œ it was ju
st a horrible, horrible atmo sphere in the 
ca-camp. But at this Œ in this camp, 
Erik
 was there, I had some frien ds. My Œ I made 
friends with some teenagers my age. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
31
Q: You were now 14 years old. 
A: Right, 13 - 14, right. So, we met in 
the evening, and one of the boys who was 
suppose Œ supposing my boyfriend was Œ ha
d a beautiful voice. So , he was singing, 
another was telling jokes. And I always wrote.
 I wrote poetry or stories on home life. 
So we met in the evening a
nd we shared, either in song
, memo ries from home, or 
my stories from home, and we
 were together still. But th
en one day, the camp was 
liquidated and we have Œ we had to move
 to another camp. Si
milar, also a labor 
camp. 

Q: What was its name? 

A: 
Pwa Œ Plaszó w.  
Q: 
Plaszó w. 
A: 
P-l-a-s-z-o-w.  
Under Œ 
Q: Is this the camp where 
Amon Goeth
 was? 
A: Near it. 
Q: Near it, okay. 
A: 
Ge-Goeth Œ Goeth
 we called Œ in camp  we had 
Get, 
but 
Go eth. 
Q: 
Goeth. 
A: 
Goeth
 was in 
Plaszó w
 concentration camp . 
Q: And you were in the labor camp. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
32
A: And I was in the 
Plaszó w 
labor camp, which was in walking distance. But, again, 
we knew that as long as we obeyed the rules, we probab ly will live. 
Q: And so your father, your uncle, your 
Œ your aunt, and your brother were there all 
together. 
A: All together. And some of my friends. 
Q: Okay. Now, did you Œ in 
these camps, did you live in 
the same Œ  like, as families 
in a room, or were the men were separated Œ 
A: No, no, no, men separate Œ 
Q: Œ from the women. 

A: Œ men were separate
 
there then, and of co urse we 
Œ on the plank beds, which you 
see Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ in pictures, like sardines next to each other. 

Q: Okay. So it could be Œ I™m sorry to in
terrupt, but it could be
 that things could 
happen during the day to a family 
memb er, and you wouldn™t find out Œ 
A: No, no. 

Q: Œ you wouldn™t know. 
A: No. 
Q: Okay . 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
33
A: So, in  the Œ we mo ved to Œ to  the labor camp
 Plaszó w
 and in the group of my  
friends were siblings, brother and sister, 
Lola
 and 
Henyik
(ph).
 Lola
 was my age, 
and 
Henyik
(ph) was a little bit older and 
they had a younger brother 
Erik™s
 ag e, and 
they had an older brother who was a po
liceman, camp  policeman, and they had a 
sister who also married shortly before that
. So there were five kids from the same 
family, no parents. Parents were gone, just the kids. 
Q: Wow. Can I interrupt just for a second?
 I hear noise outside. Can we close the 
doors here? Okay . Yeah, paus
e. All right, I™m so sorry. 

A: It™s okay. 

Q: You were talking Œ are we back on? 
Okay. We were talking about the five 

siblings whose parents weren™t there any mo
re, who probably  had been deported  or 
Œ or lost somehow. 

A: Right, right. One day, the policeman br
other went with a group of prisoners who 

are working outside of the camp, went with
 them out of the camp, and either he 
bought, or somebody gave him 
a loaf of bread. And when  he came to camp , they 
found it, and they shot him. So that was another Œ 

Q: Shock. 
A: Œ really shock for us, really, because he
 was such a wonderfu
l young man. Such a 
wonderful young man. Also, another memory I 
have of this camp is that there was a 
young, married woman, Mrs.
 Unger Œ Un gar, u-n-g-a-r
. Her husband was also in 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
34
camp. And she became friendly Œ I guess sh
e worked in the kitchen and became 
friendly with the cook. Friendly meaning hu
man Œ a human being to a human being, 
nothing going on between them, just kind 
to each other. He was 
Œ and one night we 
were in beds when two or three of the Nazis came in and ask, is Mrs.
 Ungar
 here? 
And so she said yes. So they called her, th ey  asked her, what is your name? And she 
said,
 Mathilda
. And they said
, Mathilda
, 
ein schöner namen
, a beautiful name. 
They  took her with them, and 
they shot her. Just becau Œ 
Q: Was the cook German? 

A: The cook was a German person in the k
itchen. That™s it, see? So these were the 
two instances in the ca
mp  that I vividly reme mb er, and how they  ca Œ 
ein schöner 
Mathilda
. Always when I heard this name,
 Malthilda
,
 ein schöner namen, 
a 
beautiful name. In this camp we heard of 
Plaszó w 
concentration camp , and of
 
Goeth. 
Q: What did you hear? 
A: We Œ I heard people say that they would 
rather die in this cam
p than go to this 
camp over there. I heard that this 
Goeth
 is a brutal Œ he is really a subhuman, you 
know, brute Œ very, very cruel. And Œ bu
t the choice was not our made, and one day 
they liquidated 
Plaszó w
 labor camp , and we had to walk to 
Plaszó w
 camp. 
Q: Oh my, oh my.
 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
35
A: 
Erik
 was walking with my uncle and my dad.
 I was walking with my aunt in the 
women™s group. As soon as we reached the gates of 
Plaszó w
, they separated the 
children from the grownups. There was a lot of crying, a lot of screaming and 
begging and children didn™t want to leave, 
parents didn™t want to leave, and it was 
horrible. It was just abso
lutely horrible. And the Œ 
Q: Was this 1943 already? 

A: I-It was ni Œ yes, it was. 
Q: So you were 15 and 
Erik
 was 13. 
A: 
Erik
 was 12 actually. I was 14. 
Q: 12, I see.  
A: I was 14. 
Q: That™s right Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ because you were
 born in December, at the end of the year. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And so after lots of commo tion and sc
reaming and crying, the Germans said, the 
children will be going to sepa
rate barracks, and just si
mply, you know,
 pulled them 
away from the parents and with all th
e screaming, I didn™t know what was 
happening. I found myself in a huge ro
om, with all the women, huge room. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
36
Q: So you weren™t take
n with the children? 
A: Well, I didn™t know what was happ 
Œ I knew everybody was taken Œ I was in 
such a state of Œ of disbelief what™s happeni
ng. I found myself in 
this room with all 
the women, and there were big windows. 
And we were Œ the Œ th e build ing was on a 
hill, and the women close to the window 
noticed that our men are below, in a 
barrack below, but there was a fence betw
een us. So  the women who were near the 
window were calling the names of the peop
le whom they knew, you know, that we 
recognize some people, so there was a lo
t of calling, come here, you know, your 
father, your brother, whoeve
r. And I don™t know how long it took til I Œ finally I was 
called, and my  father was out. And all I s Œ oh, on th e day wh en I found my self in 

the barrack, we heard terrible machine gun fire. 
Q: This is in the concentration camp? 
A: Yeah, in 
Plaszó w Œ 
Q: Already, so Œ yeah . 
A: It™s already under
 Goeth
. Terrible machine gun fire. 
When I heard this machine 
gun fire, I completely froze. I said, our po
or children being kille
d? So when I came 
to the window, I ask my father, 
Erik
? I just called
 Erik?
 And my father just did, 
you know, like I don™t know. 
Q: I don™t know. So  you succeeded  in being taken with  the wo men, but 
Erik 
was 
taken with the children. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
37
A: 
Erik
 was taken Œ I didn't  Œ 
Q: No, you didn™t know. 
A: Œ I didn't know. 

Q: You didn™t know. 
A: I didn™t know, I just ask my  father a
nd so  he said, I don™t 
know. And Œ but I had 
this Œ this horrible feeling, 
this horrible premonition that
 they were our children who 
are being killed. The next da
y we were taken to work 
and we were carrying big, 
wooden boards, like 
for building barracks. Well, yo
u can imagine, I was a small 
teenager. It was very difficu
lt for me to carry the board
s, and the camp  was quite 
hilly. You know, up th
e hill, down the hill. And alwa
ys when we were marching in 
the group, we were searching for people. I always for my fath
er. Until the second 
day or third day, I don™t know ex actly
, because the whole thing is like a huge 
nightmare for me. Finally I saw my father™s
 group, and he was searching for me. So 
when  we Œ they were walkin
g opposite us, so he came to
 me and he grabbed me, and 
I could barely recognize my  
father. I could barely recognize him, he Œ something 
terrible happened to him, I knew. So, he Œ 

Q: What did he look like? 
A: Œ grabbed me, just Œ he age, I cannot
 tell you, beyond Œ beyond recognition. So, 
he grabbed me and held me, and I said, 
Erik
? And he said, not here. That™s all he 
could say, and Œ and 
you know, we couldn™t talk, he 
had to leave. And a few days 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
38
later, we were very short time in the camp, 
we were Œ we were again herded to the 
railroad station to be shipped so mewhere 
else. And wh en we were standing at the 
railroad station, my  father again managed 
to find me and came to me, and held  me 
and said Œ pointed to a rock
 on a hill – and said, do you 
see this hill? That™s where 
Erik
 is. Only wh en we were in the other ne
xt camp , I found out that when  they  shot 
the children, they were covere
d with a little bit soil, but th
ey selected 50 men to bury 
them, and my father was among them. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And he Œ he could see 
Erik™s
 hand, cause he had th e ring. So , from there Œ thank 
you Œ from there we went on our first train 
journey, and I don™t have to tell you wh at 
the trains were like, I™m sure you heard 
it from many people. Pack ed like sardines, 
people were crying, screaming, silent, 
disbelief, you know, we Œ resignation, well, 
you name every feeling. No  place to go to the bathroom, I Œ when  I think of it today, 

I think how humiliating it was, yo
u know, to be Œ to urinat
e right there, the smell, 
the hunger, th-the thirst, ev
erything. The fear. And at one point, they s Œ this train 
stopped and wo men at the tee
ny window could see that we were on some kind of 
field. And the Germans with their rifles ca
me in, were banging on the Œ on the ra Œ 
on th e car Œ on the train, you know. 

Q: On th e doors, or on the Œ yeah . 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
39
A: On th e doors, banging and screaming, a
nd then there were so
me shots, andwe 
were thinking, is that it, where we are going
 to Œ to die? And always my thought, is 
my father still alive? S o  Œ 
Q: Had you had any conversa
tions with him Œ when  everything started, and you 
were in 
Poland
 and things kept getting wo rse a
nd worse and worse 
and worse, did 
he ever sit down  or Œ did 
you have any Œ an y discussion
s about what was going on, 
or did he try to keep  it all inside so to spare Œ 
A: My father? 
Q: Yeah, to spare you any kind of fear? 

A: He ti Œ he Œ he did try to hide a lot from me, a lot. But I could sense the pain. So, 

the youngest brother of Œ only 
Lola  
surviv e. The two of us were the only two 
children from the whole group th at survived . 

Q: From 
Lo la
 and 
Henyik
(ph) you mean? 
A: Yeah. From
 Lola, 
and 
Henyik
(ph) was on th e men™s side Œ 
Q: So Œ 

A: Œ so I didn™t know what happened. Bu
t I heard that the younger brother, my  
brother™s age, was killed also. And when we
 were in the other camp, we heard that 
Erik
 was beaten because Œ we thought they shot 
him because he would beg, let me 
live, I will work. This is the onl
y date I remember. November 15
th
.  
Q: November 15
th
. – How old was he? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
40
A: Between 11 and 12. This was the only tim
e in my life that I wanted to die. The 
only time I wanted to  die. But, I decided I 
have to live for my fa
ther. So, we went on 
the train, and th e next stop was deeper in 
Poland
. 
Georgie
, it will take a long time. 
I™m sorry we had Œ have Œ yo-you didn™t go
 to the meetin g yet,
 did you? Oh, you 
went already? Yeah? Okay, I think we Œ 
how lo ng have been Œ we been talking 
now? 

Q: A little over an hour. Over 70 minutes. 70 minutes. 
A: Oh, it was to take a while Œ a little while. 
A2: How long? 

A: No, I™m just Œ I don™t know, another hour, 
hour and a half probably. I will have to 
Œ 
Q: Thank you, thank you.
 I know it™s costing you. 
A: That™s okay. And so, we came to th
e next stop and the 
next stop was Camp

Q: So there you were. 
A: Œ we are in the camp 
Skarzy sko-Ka mienna.
 I didn™t know, an -and th ey divided 

us in three groups in

Q: Men and wo men? Were there men there too? 
A: Mixed, mixed, three groups, men and wo
men. And I didn™t know that there were

A: I think. I have it somewhere becaus
e I have the Œ I have a book about 
S k a rzy sko -
Kamienna
 called
 ﬁDeath Comes in Yellow.ﬂ 
Q: I see. 
A: So, I was very fortunate Œ fortunate is 
my  four Œ once my  fourth  grader, when 
children had to write their im-impression of 
my  talk, he said, people say that you are 
lucky. I don™t think so, he said. Nobody wh
o was there was lucky. And it Œ but I was 
lucky that my father and I were assi
gned to th e same camp , which was Camp
 B
. But 
my  uncle and aunt were gone, and I had no
 idea where. So, wi Œ it was very sad for 
me because I really loved her. She was my
 mother, my sister, everything after my 
mother was taken away. We
 came to Œ to the Camp
 B.
 There was 
A, B 
Œ
 werk
 
arveg
(ph), 
bayvek
(ph), 
catsen
(ph), they were called. 
Q: Did you learn German during these years? 

A: I knew German. 

Q: You knew German, of course. 
A: I Œ I Œ 
Q: You knew German before, so Œ 

A: Œ knew German, right. 
Q: Was that Œ 
A: And by then I spoke very 
well Polish. I actually wrote already Polish poetry by 
then, yeah. So we Œ when 
we came to the camp, people were ask if anybody has 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
44
some technical or mechanical skills. And 
my father, thinking 
quickly, thought it™s 
probably  a good idea to have something, so
 he came forward, an
d they brought some 
tools to show him if he can recognize wh
at they are, because, you know, people 
were lying. So my father could recognize 
it because he saw it in the store. So, he 
was work ing in a Œ in a work shop, and his 
shifts were alw ays daytime. I was tak en 
to ammunition factory, and my  shifts 
were 12 hour shifts, one week day, one 
weeknight. My work was extr
emely difficult, extremely di
fficult. That was probably 
my most difficult time in camp, physically
. I was given Œ hand a tray with hundred 
pieces of ammunition, tha-that big, and I 
had to carve rings around the ammunition. 
My wo rk  was standing at a huge machine, 12
 hours shifts, no place to sit or rest. I 
had to open the machine, put the Œ take the ammunition, pu
t it into the machine, take 
the other ammunition out, like two mo tions. Oil was dripping on the ammunition 
because the ammunition came out quite hot.  My finger was burned to the bone, so 

painfu l, I Œ and standing 12 hour and th is
 motion to open this
 big machine, it was 
unbelievable. I was so hungry, 
we were so hungry, so tired
. I Œ when I talked for the 
first time to a group of st
udents, and I was showing them how I opened the machine, 
I stopped talking. I forgot that I have a grou
p of kids listening to me. I realized what 
happened  to  my  finger, you know, the fles
h was so burned out, it grew together, but 
Œ the skin grew togeth er, but the flesh co
mpletely deformed my finger. It was Œ it 
was very difficult, it w as clearly
 extremely difficult work. One Œ 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
45
Q: What kind of ammuni Œ I™m Œ 
A: Ammunition? 

Q: What kind Œ yeah , what kind of Œ we
re Œ were these bullets, were these Œ 
A: Bullets, bullets about that Œ 
Q: Bullets. 
A: Œ big, and Œ and I had to test them th
rough a gauge, and if 
it slipped through the 

gauge Œ it had to click into it, if you Œ 
if it went through, I had to discard the 
ammunition and call a technician, you know, 
mechanic to Œ to ad
just the machine. 
But every so often I had to test it. And on
e time, I was so tired, I was just so, so 
tired, I cou Œ I couldn™t stand any mo re,so I crouched somewhere near the machine 

for a few minutes and I fell asleep and the 
German supervisor came and screamed at 
me, and Œ when  we were Œ in the evening 
we were Œ we got a bowl of soup, and a 
slice of bread. We experimented with the 
bread. Sometimes we starved ourselves to 
keep the bread for the 
next day, that if we have two 
slices, we™ll not be so hungry. 
We still went hungry because we Œ it was so
 painful, the hunger
 was so different 
from when we are hung
ry here. So different, it never went out of our mind. It was 
constantly on our mind. On e day we made cr
umbs, and we were hoping that if we 
eat little crumbs, it will last. No matter what 
we did, it wasn™t. So one day, we were 
standing for soup at night and my father 
didn™t come. We always, when I had th e 
day shift, we always stood together. The pr
isoners always let me stan d, because I Œ I 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
46
was one of the very few child
ren. So they  always protected me, and you know, let 
me stand next to my  father. And on th is ev
ening my father didn™t come. So I didn™t 
know what happened to
 him. I took my bowl of soup
 and I went to his barrack. He 
was in bed, and he said that he was too 
tired to come. I knew that it is impossible 
because we were so hungry, w
ould have crawled, you know, 
to Œ to get this piece of 
bread. Only later I found out that he went
 by the camp ™s kitchen, and he found a 
carrot in a trashcan, which he
 took for me, and they caught
 him and they beat him so 
terribly that he couldn™t move. But he wa
nted  to hide his pain from me. Then, one 
day, it was Yom Kippur, the holiest day, an
d Œ and people knew that I was writing, 
and so th ey ask me if I could read  somethi
ng for a Œ they wanted to  have a special Œ 
some way to celebrate the hol
iday. I knew that my father 
will be at work, so I wrote 
something. Not a poem, just
 a story, my  memories of Yom Kippur at home, 
comparing it to what we ha
ve now. And it was packed, it was packed and wh en I 
was reading it, I heard somebody in the b
ack crying. And I Œ wh
en I looked, I saw 
my father. You know, I didn™t 
know that he will be there. 
And then my birthday is in 
December, but of course, who 
Œ who wanted to think abou
t birthday? Every day was 
the same, we didn™t know 
even  what day it was because each day was the same. 
Q: December what? 
A: December 22
nd
. And wh en we stood the line Œ in 
line for food, my 
father gave me 
a birthday gift. I couldn™t believe this. It wa
s a comb this big, it was made of steel, 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
47
he made it in the wo rksh op. Teeth not co
mp letely even, and I thought it was the 
most beautiful gift. I carried 
it with me, I slept on it, I Œ I 
didn't leave it off my side. 
I couldn™t believe how he risk his life to 
make it. If he would have been caught fo r 
this lousy, ro tten carrot, then he Œ he was 
beaten like this, they 
would catch him. So 
I was really  Œ I loved this comb. Then, when
 I finished my night shift, some of Œ a 
little bit earlier, before the men went to wo
rk the day shift, so
 I sneaked into my 
father™s barrack. I knew what I™ll find. A
ll the men were sleeping and my father™s 
sitting next to a freestanding stove, sitting. I 
walked in, not talking, sat next to my 
father – we just held each other. And 
that way we shared our Œ our love. 
Q: He sounds like an amaz
ing ma n, an amazing Œ 
A: Our Œ our fear and our Œ 
our hopes. On e day in Decemb er Œ okay Œ then  one day 
I was working and it was almo st the end of 
th e Œ oh, I Œ I have to mention Œ mention 
that once a month we were
 taken on trucks to Camp
 A, 
which was the main camp. 
And I found out that my  aunt and uncle are on Camp
 A
, and that my  aunt, my  
beautiful aunt was selected 
to be the housekeeper of 
Cuneman
(ph). 
Q: I was going to ask you ab out 
Cuneman
(ph), we hadn™t talked about him yet. 
A: He was a hunchback. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Always walking with a dog or two, 
always. And my  aunt was his housekeeper. 
So, when we came to Œ they took us to
 delouse, because there was a terrible 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
48
epidemic of typhoid in the camp, and then  
it was already under control, but every so 
often, they took us to delouse us
, our clothes, our hair, us, to Camp
 A.
 When I came 
to Camp
 A,
 a group of people were walking ther
e, and I looked at them and I said, 
are these human beings? Are these human
 beings? The people were yellow green; 
their eyes, their teeth, their fingernails, ev
erything was yellow green. I said, who are 
these people? They we
re people from Camp
 C
, the worst of th
e camp, which the 
people were working Œ wo rking with poison
ous gases, and they  were dying a slow 
death. It was Œ the book I have about 
Skarzy sko-Kamien na
 called
, ﬁDeath Comes 
in Yellow
,ﬂ is because of the pe
ople. When we came to 
werk A,
 often, we have to Œ 
they assembled us on a big 
assembly place, and we ha
d to watch executions of 
prisoners by hanging or by shooting. So, wh
en  I was Œ when we 
were supposed to 
go to 
werk A
, my emotions were really torn, becau se I was so happy to be able to 
see my  beloved aunt and uncle, but I was so
 afraid to see an-a
nother execution. The 
worse were also Œ okay Œ one
 day I was so tir ed
 working at this 
huge machine, and it 
was the end of the shift, and I was Œ I just di
dn™t know what to do
, I just Œ I didn™t Œ 
I was almo st sleeping and work ing. And th e 
obermeister
 came to check the 
ammunition, and went to Œ took so me of mi
ne and it went throu
gh, and he™s got, 
was ist ein das
, what is this? Then he took the ne
xt one and it went through, and he 
started louder, 
was ist ein das
? And th en the next one, and all of it was bad, all of it 
was bad. Ho w could I tell him that I just c
ould not function? I Œ I Œ I just couldn™t do 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
49
it any more, I was so tired, 
and so hungry, I didn™t know 
what I was doing. So after 
the Œ after a few, he took th e ammunition a
nd with every one he knocked on my hair 
and screamed, 
was ist ein das, was ist e in das?
 And then he walked away to his 
office, which was off the machine room. 
After a few min u tes he came back and 
called me. As I was walking 
behind him, I knew. I knew  wh at it meant. And I could 
s Œ I could see the silence of the Œ I could 
hear the silence of my  fellow prisoners 
and I could see their tears as I was ma-mar
ching behind him. And all I reme mb er is 
thinking, what will it do to my 
father when he finds out that he had lost me too? I Œ I 
knew what my fate will be. I came to his o
ffice, and he looked at me and looked at 
me and looked at me and paused . And th
en he said, take th
e b r oo m, sweep  my  
office, and go back to  work . 
I don™t know if my  youth m
oved him, if he had maybe a 
daughter my age. Bu t something moved him.
 I also am convince
d that when I was 
not taken in 
Plaszó w
, it was because I was sma
ll and I was standing behind 
somebody and they  simp ly did not see me
. Because there™s absolutely no reason 
why I am here and my  brother and others 
are dead. Th Œ I™m Œ 
I™m convinceof it, 
that they just did not see me. And it™s 
not because of I Œ because I was hiding, 
because I wasn™t. I Œ you know. So Œ 
so th at was my other miracle, 
[indecipherable]
 that I went behind him and Œ and he
 decided, go back to work . Bu t 
when my father found out, 
he was so worried that I 
will not surviv
e this camp, 
because it was such horrible 
work, that when he Œ wh
en we went to see Aunt
 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
50
Pauline,
 he Œ and she also, was terribly worried
 about me. So they  decided that she 
will talk to 
Cuneman
(ph) to move my father and me to 
werk A.  
Q: Was it successful? 
A: After a few months, I was moved, but my  
father did not get permission. So here I 
Œ I Œ I Œ I adored my father, so I was ag
ain torn. It was easier for me, but I was on 
[indecipherable]
 every minute worried about my
 father. The worst were the 
selection. They used to come on trucks, 
the Germans, and always when we heard 
them coming on trucks, it was this fear. We
 had to line up and th ey Œ they walked 

and they said, 
du, du
 Œ you, you, you Œ and we never 
knew, should we look at them, 
should we look up, sideways, back , wh ich 
way? Should we stand crooked, crou Œ 
you know, never Œ how can we avoid 
du
, because we knew what it meant. And the 
first people who were always taken were 
people with white hair. And my father, 
since 
Erik
 was killed, my father was white. So 
always when I heard that they saw 
some trucks from 
werk
 
A, 
passing by 
werk A,
 you know, with prisoners from 
wer k
 
B,
 I was always, my 
father still alive? 
Q: Did you work  in his house, in Œ 

A: She Œ she Œ  
Q: Œ yeah , you, with  your aunt, de
 Œ when you were transferred to 
werk A
, did you 
work  with your aunt, or were you 
[indecipherable]
  

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
51
A: No, no, she wa Œ she was his housek eeper,
 she works for him. I work ed ag ain in 
the kitchen. 
Q: I see. 

A: I was again in the kitchen. So Œ 
Q: How long Œ ex cuse me, 
how long had you been in 
werk B,
 do you remember? – 
So here? Ah, yes. So, slave 
labor from Novemb er 30, ™43 
to August ™44. About nine 
years. 

A: Yeah, but in that Œ y
eah, in Œ in Œ combine Œ 
Q: Oh, it combines with 
werk A
? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay . So Œ 
A: So Œ 
Q: Œ it was about nine months then, in total, in Œ 

A: Right. 
Q: Œ star Œ 
Starzy sko
(ph)
-K am ien na
. 
A: Right. And so , my life was easier physi
cally. And th en one da
y I woke up and I 
felt sick. And my  aunt was standing over
 me , and two other men whom I didn't 

know were standing over me, and my aunt 
was crying. And I didn™t know wh at is 
wrong with me. And they moved me to a lit
tle place, not to the hospital, and I didn't 
know wh ile I was there what Œ what was 
wrong with me, but after I recovered, I 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
52
found out that I had typhoid, and it was a ti
me when the orders came that every new 
case must b e shot immediately because the 
epidemic was over, and they didn™t want 
a new spread of e-epidemic, so every new cas
e had to be shot. And here they didn™t 
report, and I think th at 
Cuneman
(ph) mu st have known that
 I had typhoid, I don™t 
know, but that he 
[indecipherable]
 for my aunt™s sake. I don™t know if my aunt had 
to pay a price for it, I don™t know. 
Q: Did you ever meet him? 
A: Yeah, sure.  
Q: Was he Œ wh at was he like? 

A: He was a very cruel man, very b
itter, being a hunchbac
k, you know, and 
[indecipherable]
 very beaten, but he Œ 
Q: Was he physically ugly? 

A: Yes, yes, yes. But in the conteres Œ in contrast to 
Goeth
, who was very handsome 
man in Œ in 
Plaszó w. 
He was very handsome. Have you seen the movie with his 
daughter? 

Q: No, I haven™t. 

A: She is not a very attractive girl, or y
oung woman. She is not attractive, and her 
father was so attractiv e. That is the Œ it™s called Œ I™ll remember. T h ere is a Œ a 

documentary with his daught
er, who found out Œ she did 
not have good relationship 
with her mother. And her moth

you are just like your father. And she assu
me d that her father was on the front, that 
he was a military Œ 
Q: That Œ she didn™t know who he was. 

A: No. She thought th
at he died as a soldier. So she ask her grandmother, why did 
my mom say that I™ll end like 
my father, that I™m like Œ so
 her gran dmother told her 
what happened, that he was executed becaus
e of the horrible things he did. So  she 

started researching him, and found a 
housekeeper, a Jewish
 housekeeper who 
worked for her father in 
New Jersey
. 
Q: Is this 
Helen
? Because that™s the one who was profiled in 
ﬁSchindler™s List.ﬂ 
A: 
Helen
 who? 
Q: Was a housek eeper too, with 
Goeth. 
A: I don™t remember. 

Q: Okay . 

A: But, and a me Œ okay Œ 
Q: Anyway Œ 
A: So the two met in 
Plaszó w.  
Q: Oh, I think I 
heard about this. 
A: They met in 
Plaszó w.  
Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes. I heard about 
the film, but no, I have not seen it.  

A: Yeah, yeah, okay. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
54
Q: So Œ 
A: So Œ so he was not a ve
ry attractive man. But that was another Œ another one of 
my  survivors, you know.  

Q: So, you had the ty phoid. 
You don™t know what cost it 
might have been to your 
aunt, or to th e others who saved 
you, but you were able to heal. 
A: Right. 

Q: You were able to eat better. 
A: Without them sending me to the hospita
l, and I listened to a tape. My cousin 
interviewed my uncle, my ha Œ my aunt™s hu
sband. So he says on the tape Œ on the 
tape that Aunt
 Polly
 and he practically adopted me. 
And he write about the ty phus, 
that they managed to get everyone in the 
camp, put me in the room, isolated, and so  
Œ so that™s Œ that was 
Skarzy sko-Kamienna
, and as I said, 
Skarzysko-Ka mienna
 
was a Œ then, 
Skarzy sko-Kamienna
 was liquidate. I don™t know wh at happened to 
Skarzy sko-Kamienna
, but we had Œ again we were he
rded to the trains once more. 
Q: And Fath er, where was he? 
A: And Fath er was also, but he was in a Œ you know, he was in 
B
, 
werk bay, 
and I 
was in Œ in 
A,
 so I didn™t know exactly what was happening to  him. But we were 
shipped to 
Germany
, and this time it was 
Buchenwald. 
Q: I™ve been there. 

A: Pardon? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
55
Q: I™ve been there. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But many decades later. Many decades later. 

A: So when we came to 
Buchenwa ld,
 my  father was shipped elsewhere. It was only 
a women™s camp, and I had no id ea where my
 father is. S o , new horror came over 
me, here I was separated from him, 
and I had no idea wh ere he was. 
Q: Were you with 
your aunt, though? 
A: Yes, yes.  

Q: Okay . 

A: When we came to this camp, we had 
to  put everything we possessed, everything 
we had to  put on a pile. I had my  poetry, my  stories, everything I had, I put it on the 
pile. But I decided th at there is no way, no
 way anybody is going
 to take away my 
comb. But what do I do
? They searched us, 
they Œ we Œ they stripped us, we had to 
take our clothes off, how can I keep it? 
So, we had wooden clogs
. I started kicking 
the ground under me, and scra
tching and here, with all the women around me, and I 
Œ I kicked  a hole deep  enough, and I buried 
my comb, with the hop
e that when I ever 
get out, I™ll find it. As long as I was in 
Buchen wald
, I was kicking and kicking and 
walking all around th e camp, because I ha
d no idea wh ere I buried it. When we 
arrived I didn™t know th e phys
ical layout of the camp, so I was never able to find it, 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
56
never. And when I tell this story to my little
 students, the especially little, will y ou 
go back, will you lo ok for it, w
ill you Œ I said, I was there 
and I didn™t find it. So Œ 
Q: But you didn™t give it up, e
ither, that™s th
e good thing. 
A: Well, I Œ I™m stil l sorry that I never found it. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But in the meantime, somebody made for 
me a comb which is 
very special to me, 
and that™s another story. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So Œ 

Q: In 
Buchenwald. 
A: 
Buch enwald
 was Œ work  in 
Buchenwa ld 
was easier  than in 
Skarzy sko-
Kamienna. 
I was again in ammunition fa-factory.
 I was work ing on bomb s. And Œ 
but it was sitting, there were 10 of us in a row, including my aunt. I had two sisters 

on each side. They were older, I was the yo
ungest, and we were cleaning with big, 
metal rods, we were cleaning scratches in
side of the bomb s. I learned the mo st 

beautiful poetry during this
 time, Polish poetry. The twosister s st art ed one day to Œ 

just bring so mething from the outside world.
 And I was so hungry
 to learn, I said, 
teach me. And so they  started Œ I star
ted memorizing in the words which we 
couldn™t pronoun Œ which I 
could not remember. Somebody smuggled a piece of 
chalk, so I wrote it on the bomb. And it Œ 
I Œ I just Œ several poems, but one was a 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
57
very, very  long poem 
about the father in 
Lebanon,
 who has, I think seven children, 
and each one died of a epidem
ic, and he describes the deat
h of each of his children 
and his wife. And at the end it says, wh
ere the cemetery is, there is my way 
[indecipherable],
 and it™s a very beautiful poem
. And after the war, everybody, 
from my friends who went to 
Poland
, I said, please try to 
find the poem for me. 
After years, a colleague of mine in school said, 
Edith, 
I think I found 
the poem for 
you. My  aunt, here in 
Washin gton
 has the book of poetry, 
and the poem is in it. She 
brought me Œ it was like finding a beloved 
friend, but I couldn™
t believe, 14 pages, 
that I learned 14 pages like this, and this 
was not the only poem. I have it, I printed it 
several times and it got Œ and I thought no, I 
Œ impossible that I learned all of it, but 
when I went through all of it, the poem, I 
remembered that I knew every single line. 
I don™t know the poem now in its Œ but I s
till remember the first. 
But I Œ it was really 
Œ it meant so much for me 
to Œ in this camp , also one time somebody smuggled 
pieces of cloth, different pieces of clot
h and needle and thre
ad. And one of the 
women was a sea mst r ess, so she made beau
tiful collars for us on our prisoner™s 
dress. I have my  prisoner™s dress. 

Q: You have your prisoner™s dress? 
A: It will go to the museum, but only after I 
[indeciphera ble]
 I™ll show it to you. 
Q: Okay . 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
58
A: Okay. So, on our prisoner dresses, we ha
d this Œ we knew we cannot walk out of 
the room, but for just few seconds, we felt 
we had the most beautiful party dresses, 
you know? In
 Buch enwald
, I had a very good oversee
r. He mu st have been in  Œ 
working in Œ in this ammun
ition company before the war. 
Not a Nazi. I knew that he 
felt very sorry for me, he was a very ki
nd man. So metimes he brought a piece of 
bread, sometimes an apple, and he hid it, an
d he told me where to find it. As I told 
you before, my mother used 
to sing German operettas and songs. On e day he started 
singing a song that my moth
er used to sing. And it was like somebody took a knife 
and went through my  heart. I burst out in 
tears, and he came to me and asked me,
 
wa rum weinst du?  
Why Œ why are you crying? Well,
 I was so choked up that I 
couldn™t answer. The next day when he ca
me, I ask him, please sing it. He said, 
please tell me why did you cry? So  I told hi
m. And he tra Œ look at me, and he said, 
I™ll never sing th is song again. In  this 
camp was Œ were some non-Jewish prisoners, 
they were not the same prisoners as we we
re, but they were stil
l prisoners. And there 
was a Belgian young man, an electrician, 
who was working fixing something. And I 
call him my friend, although we never spok
e. We communicated with our eyes and 
our smiles. And he used to Œ to  point wh ere he put newspaper clippings, so I would 
know that it™s coming to the end. And I w
ill read to you the end of Œ of the war, 
okay? Cause that™s what I™m usually Œ  

Q: So, did you 
[indecipherable]
 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
59
A: This is my  precious gift story about th
e comb , wh ich was published in several pa 
Œ places, including this one here. 
Q: Oh. 

A: Excuse me, I™m going to  the bathroom. Do you want Œ 
[break]  
Q: I don™t have to say anything then ? Ok ay, all right. So Œ 

A: Last weeks before liberation,
 Leipzig, Buchenwald.
 My father was also in
 
Buchen wald . 
Q: But you didn™t know it. 
A: I didn™t know for a long
 time, but then  one day some German Œ some Nazis came 
and said that we are allowe
d to write a short card to 
Buch enwald
 men™s group. I 
didn™t know if my father is dead or no
t, but I wrote. And my  aunt wrote to her 
husband, and I got an answer back . We coul
d all write just I™m fine, I am happy, you 
know, and Œ and Œ ju st few word s. I gave th
e letters to the muse
um. So I knew then 
my father was in 
Buch enwald. 
Q: And he was alive. 

A: And he survived. Okay, it 
was at the end of March or
 beginning of Ap ril, 1945. 
From newspaper clippings smuggled into 
the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish 
Belgian friend, we knew that the situati
on did not look good for the Germans. One 
evening, as we lay stretched 
on our plank beds, we heard 
sounds of shelling, gunfire 
and explosions. We knew that these were th
e sounds of th e American front being so 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
60
near. What sweet sounds they were. Ou
r hopes for being soon free rose high. 
Unfo rtunately, our euphoria was very sh
ort-lived. Around nine
 or 10 o™clock the 
same evening, we were ordered to  assemb
le outside on th e assemb ly field. I don™t 
remember if we were told for what purpos
e. We were given some supply of food, 
and we were marched out of the camp  in
to the darkness of the night. About 5,000 
women began their new journey. A jour
ney which became known as the death 
march. We marched and marched. Days re
placed nights. We ke
pt marching, given 
short periods of rest. We mar-marched in 
sunshine and we marched in the rain. We 
marched through towns, and we marched 
through villages. No one knew where we 
were going. Later we found out that we we
re walking between the American and the 
Russian front. While we were marching, we
 were heavily guar
ded by our captors. 
They  were work ing in
 shifts. Replacements for them
 were coming on trucks. Food 
was delivered to them, while
 our was long gone. The 
officers among our captors 
were driving by in comfortable cars, en
joying the sight of marching subhuman 
creatures. Their spotless starch uniform
s were highly polish Œ and highly pol-
polished boots, must have been quite a cont
rast with the wrecks and filths we were 
in. I remember when others were given to 
rest, we turned the seams o f our prisoners 
striped clothes from inside out, and squash
ed as many lice as we could between our 
fingernails. The itching was unbearable. By
 now some of the even ts are blurred. 
Others are more deeply engr
aved in my memory. I still 
can see half faces of the 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
61
German civilian population, th
e other half hidden behind th
e curtain, watching as we 
marched. What were they thinking? What 
did they feel? Once, taking a rest near 
woods, we heard shots. We found out later 
that someone was shot trying to escape. 
How could anyone hope to escape? Besides 
being so heavily guarded, we had only 
our prisoner™s clothes on. Ho
w far could we go without be
ing caught? So we kept 
marching. We ate grass, and even this was 
forbidden, if a cruel guard  chose to do so . 
Days and nights went by. Mo re
 and mo re people were unab
le to keep walking, and 
each of us was too weak to be able to he
lp someone else. We 
could hardly lift our 
own feet. How dreadful and pain ful it was to
 have to leav e someone dear behind to  
die. We came up on a desolate concen
tration camp . There was no movement 
anywhere. It was so eerie. Where were th
e people? Were they also marching, or 
were they shipped into crematoria? When
 we still had strength 
to talk, we kept 
evaluating our situation. One terrifying th
ought went through our minds. We were 
fearful, and then when
 the Germans will real
ize that they have 
lost, they will shoot 
us anyway. We imagined that  they will need our uniforms
 to make an easier escape. 
There was so little hope for our 
survival, one way or the ot
her. How they do it, keep 
marching. My mo st vivid memo ries are of 
a situation which occurred on a farmland. 
Naturally, we were very hungry, and exha
usted when others came to rest. Some 
prisoner noticed in the distance of the fi
eld, a wagon lo aded with potatoes, which 
several farmers were about to plant. As 
soon as some of the women prisoner noticed 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
62
it, they began running to grab so me potatoes. My Aunt
 Polly
 started to run. I 
grabbed her with the little stre
ngth I had left, and pleaded 
with her not to go. Just 
then rifle fire started blasting and that
 women were falling everywhere. A young 
woman, she could have been betw een 18 - 
20 years old, was shot in the leg. Sh e 
tried to get up, but co uldn™t. Sh e was not 
too far from us. What pain and terror were 
reflected in her eyes. She screamed and 
pleaded for help. The Germans took their 
time to kill her. We kept wa
lking, leaving more and mo re people behind, often 
stepping over them. As we grew weaker a
nd could hard ly walk with our ey es open, 
letting ourselves to be pushed by th e mass of
 people, my  Œ my  aunt and our small 
group of friends around us tried to reassure 
ourself that one or the other are still with 
us. From time to time we called each ot
her™s names in weak voices, and our 
responses brought some relief to the others
. The rest periods were welcome, but it 
was increasingly mo re difficult to get up, a
nd to keep marching. 
Actually, for most 
of us, it was impossible to get up, but as 
soon as a shot was fired int o  the helpless 
prisoners, we collected our bit Œ last bits
 of energy and kept going. One day we 
found ourself on another farmland. There was 
even food for us in
 kettles in a huge 
barn. After eating and some rest, we were
 ordered once mo re to get up and to  
continue to march. Only th
is time, some of us were no longer able to do so . We 
reached our limits. We had to 
give up. We were told that 
if we will not vacate this 
barn, it will be locked and burne
d with us in it. It seemed
 that our fate was sealed. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
63
Some women were still able to get up and 
go. We found out late
r that they were 
shot, and that that Nazis did use their unifo
rms. As for us in the barn, freedom came 
in the last moment, and a Ru
ssian soldier on a motorcycle
, leading the way to more 
Russian sold iers on trucks appeared  and pr
ev ented the burning of
 the barn, with our 
living corpses in it. I have no recollection of
 what I felt at the time of our liberation. 
I Œ I don™t remember if I fully compre
hended that it was all over, and we were 
finally and truly free.  
Q: Did you have any opportunity to  sleep 
on those marches, or during the nighttime 
they kept you moving? 
A: They kept us moving all the time, we 
mu st have slept, you know, when ever they 
told us to rest, but Œ but it was more and 
more difficult to kept marching. We just 
had less and less energy. We didn't eat for days. 

Q: Do you know wh ere you ended up, on that farm? 

A: Yes, oh yes.  
Q: What was the place? 
A: The place was called 
Orschatz
. 

Q: 
Orschatz
. 
A: Here Œ here is it. 

Q: In that paper that you showed me before? 

A: Yeah, paper where I 
had all this camps. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
64
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: 
Orschatz
. I see. To
 Orschatz
, where I was liberated. And where is 
Orschatz
, is 
it still in 
Germany
, or is it Œ  
A: Actually, 
Orschatz
 is not terribly far from
 Buchen wald
, you know, we were 
walking back and forth, they
 were marching us Œ the Russi
ans came closer, so they 
marched us toward the American front. Th
e American toward th
e Russians, so we 
were Œ 

Q: I see. It was not in a lin
e, it was in a circle line. 
A: It Œ it was Œ 

Q: And did you Œ 
A: Well, when we were liberated, this 
is a my stery that I have not solved Œ 
Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute Œ 
A: Oh, I™m sorry. 
Q: It™s okay. 
A: Oh, I™m so 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: You want to show us something? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. We™ll take this off, we™ll pause it for a sec Œ 
[break]
 Just a little bit. This is 
amazing shape. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
65
A: This Œ 
Q: Are we on? The dress? Okay. 

A: This dress, if you see it in the mu seum, 
it™s another dress, but this dress, as I 

mention, I was working with ammunitions Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ oil Œ 

Q: It mu st have been Œ 
A: Œ was dripping on it, it got dirty, it had 
to be washed. This 
is the only thing we 
had fo r spring, summer, fall and winter. In summer it was hot, in wonter Œ winter it 
was extremely cold in the severe winters of 
Poland
 or 
Germany
. Can you imagine 
when we had to wash it in 
the washroom, with a little bit 
soap, whatever, and we had 
to squeeze the water out, and had no energy
, we were we Œ weak
 and hungry, so we 
couldn™t squeeze it completely, no place to dr
y. We put it on our plank beds in the 
evening, and in the morning when we were called to roll call, we had to wear it wet 
as it was, and stand in the mo st severe winters of Œ in 
Poland
, or 
Germany
. In a few 
second being outside, it turn
 into a sheet of ice. Ho
w did we just, you know Œ 
Q: I™m amazed. 

A: Œ die from Œ from this? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Just from this. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
66
Q: And your number was 781? 
A: Right. It™s quite early. 

Q: Did you Œ I see all these spots that are 
repaired. Did they cap Œ happen later, after 

you were liberated? 
A: I Œ I Œ after liberatio n. But first of all,
 I have no recollection why I kept it, how I 
kept it, where I kept it, because the first th
ing when the Russian so
ldiers saw us, th Œ 
in what filth we were, they stripped their 
shirts and they  gave to th e women. The 
women, the first thing they 
had, they took off this fu
ll of lice clothes and threw it 
away. So, how did I keep it? 
Q: You don™t remember. 

A: I don™t remember. And then we were
 assigned to the Ge
rman families in 
Orschatz, 
depending how well the fami ly was;
 some people had fo ur prisoners, 
some had six prisoners. Where I was, we we
re six. And the family had to feed us, 
clothe us, and Œ until we starte
d functioning as 
human beings. 
Q: And did Œ a couple of questions here
, when they Œ do you 
remember how they 
behaved towards you, were they Œ  

A: The Germans? 
Q: Yes, in the families. 
A: The families? They were so protectiv
e of Œ even the Œ the men, I don™t know 
what they  were doing during th e war, but they
 protected na Œ us against the Russian 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
67
soldiers, because the Ru
ssian soldiers were drinking a lot,
 and ready to rape if they Œ 
even a skeleton, they were ready to rape
. So the Germans prot
ected us and hid us 
when they saw the Russians co
mi ng, they  hid us somewh ere. It was such a strange 
time 
[indecipherable]
 so Œ 
Q: And your father, 
when did you dis Œ 
A: And my father was bo Œ liberated from
 Buchenwald
, and of course, the first 
thought was to find us, my  uncle and Œ they
 were liberated together. So they went 
from village to vel Œ village, trying to fi
nd out where the people went from this 
camp, where we went. Until somebody told them that they spotted so me people 
from our transport in 
Orschatz.
 So they Œ 
Q: They found you there. 
A: They found us when we 
were with the German family
. And that™s how my father 
Œ yeah . But I Œ I have just no recollection of this. N-None, zero. 
Q: You don™t Œ you don™
t recall seeing your father then, or seeing Œ 
A: You know wh at the strangest thing is? 
I rememb er going home with my  father to 
our hometown. 

Q: In Œ in 
Czechoslovakia
? 
A: Yeah, right. But I don™t remember the fi
rst Œ the initial meeting him after the war, 
and I think that it was because I was so afraid
 to think that it might not be true. So Œ 
Q: It was just too mu ch that you had to deal with, too mu ch . 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
68
A: So th en, when  we went home, 
we had no home. So  we went to 
Icar
(ph), my 
friend™s family, to the bakers, and they were 
in such a shock to find out wh at we Œ of 
course they didn™t know, right Œ where we
 went, but that Moth
er didn™t survive, 
Erik
 didn™t survive. They were
 Œ they were devastated by it, you know? And so I 
stayed with them for some
 time, and th e people who to ok over our home and store 
said, we will vacate as soon 
as we can, which was really
 incredible, because when 
Jewish people came back to 
Poland
, they were killed by some Poles. You know, 
they didn™t want to give back. 
Q: It Œ it™s so Œ yeah , it™s so unusual to hear this type of a story. 

A: So, not only this, but wh en people in 
the community ca Œ heard that we came 
back and what happened to us, they 
came to  my  fath e
r, they said, Mr. 
Pick
, you 
helped us when  we n
eeded it, because when we had th
e store they Œ sometimes they 
didn™t have the money to pay and my  pare
nts put it on the book, never asked them, 

because they knew wh
en the Œ if the people will have
 money, they will pay, they 
don™t have to remind them, you know? So , the people came back, she said, you gave 

us when we needed it, let us pa
y you back, and open th is store. 
Q: And that™s what happened? You got back
 your store, you got
 back your house? 
Your aunt, your uncle, 
your father and you? 
A: My aunt and uncle went to live in
 the city where my uncle came from. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
69
A: But we Œ we had our store,
 we had our home back. My 
father said, all I want is 
the housekeeper™s room in the attic, but th
ey said, this belongs 
to you, and we will 
vacate, and Œ and the people in the commun
ity were unbelievable. There™s a plaque 
on th e community build ing naming people, a
n d  many  o f my  family  memb er Œ  h ono r 
to their memory. 
Q: How long did you stay in 
Parowice

A: I stayed, I went to school, I studied like crazy, because Œ 
Q: You missed so many years. 
A: Œ I wanted to go to school with my  pe
ers. But my peers went to schools for six 

years, and I didn™t. I had a little bit Polish e

was Cs and then I had Bs and by th en e

Q: Of course, of course. 

A: But I-I was the only Jew in the Jewish Œ in the Œ in the Czec
h youth m
ovement. I 
was the only Jew in school after the war, in
 business school. I was the only school Œ 
Jew in my  sport organization. Yet I Œ I 
cannot tell you how th e people were. Really, 

I cannot tell you. But my  father remarried. 
And Œ and in  spite of all, you know, that 
we got back and that we were so welcomed
 and so accepted. Like, my father was Œ

and I were invited to  ever
y Œ in Œ in January , Februa
ry, every organization has a 
ball, a party. This ball, the firefig h ters, the policeman 
[indeciphera ble]
 we were 
invited to  every single one, my  father and 
I. In spite of this, it was like being there 
on a graveyard. Being there, especially, es
pecially on th e bridge Œ we went back  Œ 
you know, my  Œ my  fondest 
memories were of the meadow, all the family and my 
grandpa. No one was there. So, I volunteered Œ 
Q: Did you ever know about Œ mm-hm? 
A: I went to 
Israel.  
Q: Before that, I™m sorry,
 what happened to  your mo
th er? Do you Œ did you Œ 
A: Yes Œ 
Q: Œ ever find out? 
A: Œ yes, my  Œ I always thought that sh
e died, and that she perished in Œ in 
Treblinka
, but she Œ from the 
Yad Vashem
 I got that she peri
shed most likely in 
Belzec,
 one of the very first extermination camps. 
Q: I see. B u t that must have come much later. 
A: Yes. 

Q: At that point you pr
obably didn™t know wh at 
happened to your mother. 
A: No, no. 
Q: No. So you went to 
Israel
 in what year? 
A: I went to Œ in ™48, just after th
e creation. I was in the Israeli Army. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
71
Q: Well, you also went at a very inte
resting time, and a very crucial time in 
Czechoslovakia
™
s [indecipherable]
 
A: Under communists. 

Q: Yes. 
A: I did. I we Œ I Œ I lived Œ I lived
 our Œ certainly our Jewish history Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ you know, from the Holocaust 
to the Œ almost the creation of 
Israel. 
And Œ and 
when I was teaching, I was teaching here in
 the Jewish day scho
ol, and we went on a 
seminar and then we had to write our di
aries. And I couldn't read, you know, and 
they were all strangers, I couldn™t tell them
 about Œ but one time 
we had to write our 
stepping stone of our lives. And when  I was Œ 
I said that™s that I can do. So, I Œ I was 
telling them I was born in 
Czechoslovakia
, I stayed there until 
the age of 10, and 
then I Œ and we went to 
Poland
, and then to the ghetto, a
nd then to my first labor 
camp, then concentration camp, and this much, and 
Israel
. And there was such 
silence, because nobody had this kind of Œ 

Q: History. 

A: Œ life as I. And after this, a 
young woman comes to me and said, 
Edie
, how does 
one want to survive, if there is no hope, 
if everything is so 
hopeless? So I said, 
Sally, 
you want to talk? She said yes. So I said
, let™s go. We sat at a lake, and I said, 
you talk, you talk. So she was telling me th
at she had Œ she m Œ she mu st have been 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
72
35 years at this time. She s Œ she had a ba
d relationship with her parents. She said 
she Œ she joined some Moonies and 
Ro onies
, you know. She married somebody, had 
a horrible marriage. S h e was raped, she tr
ied to commit suicide. And here I was, 
looking, and I said, this is a nice Ameri
can girl, you know, what happened to  her? 
So, after she finished telling me, I said, look
 Sally,
 I™ll talk to you as a mother of 
daughters close to your age, and also as yo
ur peer. I said, would you have listened to 
your parents if they would have told  you
, don™t marry this guy, don™t join this 
group? Would you have, hones
tly? Search deep in your heart, would you have? And 
then I said, and as one thin
g to surv ive, I said, you have to find the reason why Œ 

why you want to survive. For me 
it was my father. So, she lived in 
Ohio
, and one 
day she came to give seminar on suicide, 
and the next time she came to the seminar 
on Œ on rape, or somet h ing, talked to y
oung teenager. And I invited her for dinner, 
and she said, 
Edith
, I am making you a gift. I said, 
why would sh e make gift? Oh, I 
Œ my  comb story was published a
nd, you know, and my poems, my  
[indecipherable]
 of poems that I wrote were publis
hed. So, I sent her, and she sent 
me booklet that she had on rape, and on th
e Œ she took my  comb  story and took it to 
an artisan in 
Ohio
 and said, I want you to read this 
story. I want to pay you whatever 
you want. I want to design, I want to do 
it myself, you just teach me how. He read 
my  comb  story, he said, I™m not going to 
ch arge you, ju st come and do it. Sh e Œ she 
came and she Œ wh en  she came the second tim
e she gave me this little box. When I 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
73
opened it, I was overwhelmed; there was a 
comb. And not like my father™s, but I 
was just very touched by it. And sh e told 
me how for seven weeks, twice a week she 
went to this artisan and each afternoon 
she did it, and that™s how I Œ okay, okay, 
yeah, it™s Œ 
Q: We will Œ okay, when we finish
, then you can sh
ow us the comb. 
A: Œ I took it out, because I was talking to 
some people, so I was showing it to them. 
So she Œ she made it for me, and I framed 
it and it™s on my wall.
 In the meantime, 
she died in a car acc
ident, so it™s rea
lly very special. 
Q: Oh. Tell me, how long did 
your father survive after the war? Did he move to
 
Israel
, too? 

A: No, unfortu Œ you know, I 
never thought that I™ll separate from him ever again, 
but I went as a military and he couldn't  
come with me. And he Œ his second wife 
became ill with cancer, breast cancer, during 
the time I left. So we hoping she will 
get better, and I, you know, I even borro wed money in  
Israel
 and rented a tiny 
apartment and fixed it for them. But she 
died two years later, and the communists 
were there, and Œ 

Q: And there was a hundred  and Œ 
A: Œ they  didn't let him out. So here we were
 separated again. It was horrible. It was 
horrible for me. And then, after Œ some tim
es later he remarried again, and then, 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
74
after five years of another happy marriag
e, she became ill with breast cancer, and 
she died.  
Q: Oh, he lost all three wives. 

A: That was it. When my father went, an
d he would never know, he looked  like Œ 
everybody said he looks lik
e a diploma, that his life was always good Œ wh at he 
went thro ugh. 

Q: How Œ when  did he die? 
A: He died at the age of 82. 
Q: In what year? 

A: He died 26 years a
go, something like that. 
Q: Oh, so it would have 
been in the 70s or 80s? 
A: He Œ 

Q: The 1970s or the 1980s he died. 

A: He Œ he was 80 Œ 
Q: No, no, what Œ what
 year did he die? 
A: Oh, oh, y
eah, a little bit 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So, he died 
like 1980 - 1984? 
A: I think a little bit earlier 
[inaudible]
 yeah, yeah. 
Q: But you Œ did you see him again after? 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
75
A: Oh yes, we visited him, we me t his Œ I 
never met his third wife, but Œ but with  his 
Œ he Œ he met Œ when his third wife died, 
we just moved in ou
r little house, and we 
just were a short time here in 
America, 
we have no money, but we insisted he 
should come to visit. And 
by then, the communists let hi
m because what could they 
lose? His pension th ey could keep, his ho
use they could keep, 
you know, so Œ so 
they let him, but they let him co me only fo r three months. But if this Œ when this 
was over, I was heartbroken, I was sick, I 
said, now he will again go there and be 
home alone. So we extended it six mo re months, but I was not in a better shape 

when  he had to leave. So we extended fo
r another six months. But when  he came, 
George™s 
mother was here. 
George
 is about half an hour by streetcar from where I 
used to be in the 
coal mining fr Œ community, and he is from 
Ostrava
, from the city. 
His parent was a law Œ his father was a lawy
er in the city, and my father used to 
shop for our store in 
Ostrava
, so th ey had many mu tu al acquaintances. They didn™t 
know each other, but mutual acquaintance. 
So, when his mother 
Œ his mother lived 
18 years with us, but at this time she was on
ly visiting. So when  she heard that my  
father will be coming, she was visiting, so 
she stayed longer to meet my father. So 
we had th em for about three weeks, I thi
nk, we had both of them here. And Œ and 
they knew how hard it is fo
r me to let him go. So  my  cousin  Œ my  father was her 
favorite uncle from eight siblings he had Œ 
so my  mo ther-in-law and my  cousin paid 
a fare for him to come to 
Israel
 before he goes home to 
Czechoslovakia
, so he 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
76
would have something nice 
on his way. And it was Œ he had a wonderful month in 
Israel
, and then when he came home, thr
ee women were waiting for him. But he 
didn™t Œ he married somebody else, whom
 he met visiting a sick friend. So Œ 
Q: Well, is there anything else
 you™d want to add to what
 we™ve talked about today? 
A: What I want to add, I know that most 
Œ most survivors have guilt feelings that 
they surv ived and their loved ha Œ ones didn
™t. I never felt that way, I never felt that 

way. I always felt, I was a child and a 
young teenager. I haven™t done anything 
wrong. My  parents were wo
nderful people, it™s not that 
I should have died, they 

should have lived. 

Q: Yes. Exactly, exactly. By the age of 
20 you had been  thro
ugh hell on earth, by 
the time you went to 
Israel. 
A: And then, when I speak, 
you know, college students, high school students say, 
you must hate the Germans. I said, how coul
d I? How? I have seen what hate can do. 
How could I be part of? And 
forgive, I can forg
ive for myself, and I have done it. I 
cannot forgive for 
Œ for the rest.  
Q: Thank you
 Edith. 
Thank you very mu ch  for sharing Œ 
A: Thank you. 
Q: Œ your story today. I know th at it™s cost
 something, and Œ and we really, really 
appreciate it.  
A: Thank you fo r doing it. 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
77
Q: Okay . This concludes Œ 
A: You know, it™s not hard for me to tell wh
at I went through, but it™s hard to talk 
about my brother. 

Q: Of course. He was a child. He was a child. 
A: My mother – and my father. 
Q: Yes. I can™t imagine it, 
I can™t imagine it, what it mu
st have felt to see his son 
there, what it is Œ must have felt to be afra
id for you. I can™t im
agine it, even though 
I™m a parent myself, w h en you™re not
 in that situation, yeah, it™s Œ 
A: Yeah, you know, it happened  so long a
go. When I come here, and I entertain a 
lot, I have lots of friends, when I go to the 
Gia n t
 and I buy, or anywhere and 
[indecipherable]
 always the groceries, I th
ink God, all I wanted was 
[indecipherable]
 of potatoes, or a loaf of bread. 
All I wanted was just a little corner 
where I know that nobody 
will come and drag me. You know, I have a nice 

apartment, I have a wonderful family, and 
I have Œ I™m free. Oh, and when I Œ when 
I walk, when I take a wa
lk, it still comes back. 
Q: Did you have nightmares? 
A: I went through different stages. I had 
nightmares in the beginning, but it was 
mostly about bombing. 
I went through terrible 
Œ terrific bombing in 
Leipzig
, 
terrible, when I was afraid to be separa
ted from my aunt. And I saw my nightmares 
were mostly that everybody 
went to a bunker, and I was left all alone. The bunker 

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
78
closed just before I reached, 
and then here I was in the 
world alone. But my husband 
says that when we first got married, that 
I screamed at night. Then  I had a period 
that when I was in company, I Œ I was 
listening what people were saying, but I 
found myself that I™m some
where else. So it was a shor
t period. And then I had 
period, we have our best fri
ends who moved with us, they ™re upstairs. We have been 
friends since the first w
eek we came Œ came to 
America
, which is over 15 years. So 
when  we Œ so when  we Œ I had my next 
period was that we went to Œ to some 
wonderful restaurant and we are sitting with
 friends and I burst into tears, because 
here was just so good. So I went through 
different periods, and then when we went, 
you know, sometimes when we
 are sitting somewhere in a Œ so we like to go to
 
Alexandria
, and, you know, for lunch, and sometim
es I na Œ I get tears in my eyes, 
he says, again? So Œ so I went thro ugh diffe
rent stages, but I never felt that I n eeded 
therapies. You know, I just tried to deal 
with it myself. And I am
 very fortunate. I 
loved wh at I was doing a-and Œ and we ha
ve many hobbies, and ma ny in terests both, 
fortunately, 
George
 and I. We both started painting after we retired, and Œ 
Q: Are any of these paintings yours? 
A: Yes, these are all mine over there. 
Q: Over there? 
A: Mm-hm.  

Q: And Œ  

 
RG-50.030*0584 
 

 

 
79
A: These, on this wall. 
Q: On th at wall? 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: They™re beautiful
. Lovely colors. 
A: And this wall are 
George™s. 
This is mine also, this collage here. 
Q: They™re beautiful. They™re beautiful pa
intings. And I love the color choices. 
Okay , thank you, and th is concludes our interview. 
A: Thank you. I™m sorry I really 
would love to offer you lunch. 
Q: No, no, no, ev erything is 
fine, everything is fine. We
 have kept you fo r three 
hours today, so Œ 

A: Was it that long? 
Q: Yeah, close to it. So, this concludes our interview with
 Edith Lowy ,
 on 
September 13
th
, 2010. Thank you again. 
A: And thank you fo r doing it.
