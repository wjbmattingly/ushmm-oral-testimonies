Tape 1 of 3: 
 
Q: First let me say, wel come, I™ m s o happy 
you™re doing this for the Holocaust Museum. 
 

Thank you, thank you, I™m really glad to do it. 

 

Q: (Let™s just start by you telling me  your name
, and when you were born, and where, and give 

me a little family picture.) 

 

My name  is Budd Schulberg, and I was born in r
eally a neighborhood that is
 now Harlem Œ I was 
born on 120
th
 Street, March 27, 1914. 
 

Q: And, in a way, my pa rents told me  I was ma
ybe the only person who was a born screenwriter, 
because my father wrote a photoplay Œ it was 
on a suffragist subject.  My mother was a 
suffragist, and he wrote a scree
nplay, a three-reel called ﬁWhatEvery Wo man Wantsﬂ Œ I think it 
was called.  And he got $500 for that
 script, which was quite a lot for those days.  And he told 
me  it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. 
Jellyhouse Œ I™ve always 
loved that name  Œ who 
delivered me, at home, and so I really owe my 
birth to film writing, you mi ght say.  My father 
was one of the earliest, very early photopl
ay writers, as they called them then. 
What else? 

 

Q: (Take us from New York to California.) 

 

We left when I was about six years old.  And 
my father had been working for Adolf Zukor, 
Fa mous Players, as a writer and publicist, from 
a bout the age of 18 Œ he started very, very young.  
But by the time I was born, he decided he wouldlike to branch out on his own.  And become  his 

own fil m company producer.  So we 
went out to Hollywood very early. 

 

I really reme mber the ri de on that
 train.  It was on the old Chie
f, Santa Fe Chief, before the 
Superchief, even.  And I vaguely reme mber that
, being out on the observation car, and watching 
the country fall away behind us. 

  

My father and Louis Mayer, later the fa mous th
ird ﬁMﬂ at MGM Œ the two of them together set 
up a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by 

the railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles. 
 It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio.  So 
both Mayer and BP, so they both were ma king th
ese early silent films.  That™s about it. 
 

My father™s big discovery was 
Clara Bow.  He found her in a 
Brooklyn beauty contest, actually, 
signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her 
to Hollywood.  I called Clara sort of a pre-
Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen.  Sh
e was known as the, as the ﬁItﬂ girl, from a 
fa mous novel of the time, and movi e called ﬁIt.ﬂ  
And she had it.  Clara really did have It.  She 
really did.  She™s still amazing to watch in
 those silent films.  And that™s so Œ

My father and Louis ma de their films for a few y
ears, for about three or four years, and then 
Louis Mayer went to the newly for med MGM. And at
 that point my father went over, went back 
to Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of
 the west coast studio of Pa ramount.  And so, all 
through my young ma nhood, growing up, I 
really grew up on the, in a way, on the backlot.  I 
used to go there almost every day on my bike
, drove through those famous gates, and roam 
around and play on the backlot sets, and wander into
 different stages where they were shooting 
amazing films.  So all these famous stars were 
like old hat to us Œ they were more like people 
who just worked for my father Œ was the way we thought of them. 

 

Q: (How early did you get interested in writing? ) 

 

Very, very early, I™d say I was 
about 9 or 10, very early.  It 
was very much a part of our 
household atmosphere. 

 

My father had started as a writer, with the, with
 those early photoplays. 
 And he, also as a kid, 
worked on the old 
Daily Mail
 and a short time  on the old 
World
 Œ papers that we, that we dearly 
mi ss.  There used to be about ten daily papers, 
and now we™re down to about
 two and a half.  So, 

so he, he had a great interest i
n, aside from fil m
, in uh writing. 
 

And my mother was a frustrated librarian.  And 
she set up a very big library, thousands of books, 
all set up like a regular library, all nu
mbered like a library, a real library. 
 

My father used to Œ Sunday morning was a ritual.He would read from the classics, aloud to us, 

Sunday mornings until brunch, from
 about 9:30 or so.  It™s amazing what we read. We  read 
through Dickens and Melville and Ga lsworthy, a
nd we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years 
and years, we  heard that.  So writing was very mu
ch part of our life.  So I started when I was 
about 9 or 10, started to write lit
tle stories, very much encouraged
 by my  parents.  So by the time  
I went to high school, I just t
hought of myself as  a wr
iter, as if it was al
ready my profession. 
 

And it all went Œ it fell in place very natura
lly.  I edited the hi gh school Œ Los Angeles High 
School daily paper.  We had a daily paper.  I la
ugh because these days, my
 kids at Westhampton 
High School couldn™t get out a mont
hly paper, and the thought of 
a daily paper, they couldn™t 
imagine putting it out every day.  But we did. 

 

So anyway, that™s why, so we breathed that atmos phere.   

 

My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when
 she was about 19, that Scribners published, 
entitled, 
They Cried a Little
.  Sonya said that in our house, wh
ere in other home s they mi ght have 
a piano and people mi ght sit down 
Œ Sonya said, in our house, we 
had a typewriter, and as we 
passed we might type out a little jingle or some th
ing or a little story, and we  all, Sonya and 
Stuart, Stuart wrot
e very well, too.  
 

Q: (He was 8 years younger than you. Th
at™s quite a gap when you™re kids.) 
 

It was, yes. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502

Stuart had several short stories in 
The American Best Short Stories
.  He really wrot
e very well.  If 
he hadn™t gotten into television producing, he mi ght
 very well have just  gotten into pure writing 
also.  It just ran in 
our family, really.   
 
My sister is really an excellent  writer.  I™ve ofte
n said, and I mean it. She™s a better writer, she™s a 
better, delicate writer than I am.  If we had a 
little contest, describi
ng some  Hollywood street.  
She can still do that better than 
I can; she™s very, very sharp.   
 

The difference was that I ma de, I ma
de much more of a job of it, an everyday job.  And Sonya is 
so finicky that nothing ever satisf
ies her. She™ll take a short st
ory and work on it for a year, and 
still not want  to show it to anyone.  She™s a perf
ectionist .  But in the real
 life of writing you can™t 
do that.  You™ll spend the rest 
of your life polishing one thing. 
 And Sonya tends to do that. 
 

Q: (Were you and your si blings ve ry competitive?) 

 

Not really.  I was so much the elder of the thr
ee.  And with my father
 and my mother divorcing 

when I was a teenager, 17 or 18, and Sonya a
nd Stuart younger, uh, I was very worried about 
them.  I sort of uh, took on my father™s failed re
sponsibilities.  I was wo
rrying about their school 
and how they would react to a divorce, and all 
of that.  So I wouldn™t say we were very 
competitive, no. 

 

Q: (You were born just at the time that the Fi rs
t World Wa r started.  Do you have any me mories 
of the First World War?) 

 

It™s funny, I do have.  One me mory was being ona train going west, this wa s in 1918.  It™s 

almost the first me mory I have, being on a train. 
 And I was about four years old.  And, and my 
father™s partner, Harry Abrams, his daughter was 
about eight, and the two of us were in a bunk 
together.  And we stopped in a station, and a train 
full of soldiers was just opposite the platform.  
And I reme mber looking at them and they were so
rt of jeering and ma king sort of lewd rema rks 

about, I don™t know what they were sa
ying, but I reme mber that mo ment.   
 

And I reme mber being with my mother on a      
as the soldiers were, had just come  back from 
World Wa r One and were ma rching down 5th Avenue
, and I™ve got just a glimpse of a me mory 
of that.  It™s almost my e a rliest me mories of 
Wor l d War One.  I also remember collecting silver 
tinfoil, balls of it that some how 
wer e  being given for the war effort.  I don™t know exactly how 
they used it, but those are the, those are a
bout the only ways I relate to World Wa r One. 
 

Q: (Let™s jump forward to the 
approach of World Wa r II.  No
w you have sudden success writing, 
right? Why don™t you tell us about 
that period and give us a sense of Hollywood whe n the war 
started.). 

 

Well, 19 Œ, let™s see. Wh en I got out of colle
ge in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my 
father™s assistant, had now set up his own studi
o, and was planning independent films, one of 
which of course became  
Gone with the Wind
, and the first 
A Star is Born
 Œ which was the daddy 
of all those later St ar is Borns.

And, let™s see, I came back and started working 
for David as a young screenwriter.  And I had a 
seven-year contract Œ it started 
at 50 and went to 75 a week.  At 
the end of seven years, I would 
have been making $500. And, uh, but he, but even, 
a year and a half in
to it, I would write 
screenplays that David, I don™t th
ink ever read; he was so busy 
ma king the films he was already 
planning. 
. 

And then they would call us in Œ 
I thought of it as being a, sort 
of like being a pinch hitter who 
come s in off the bench.  If there was some  i
mme diate problem, David w
ould call Ring Lardner 
and me  Œ we were a writing team.  We were bot
h about 21, 22 years old.  
We were just out of 
college. 

 

And he would call us in on Œlike on 
A Star is Born
. They couldn™t figure out the ending of 
A Star 
is Born
, and we wrote the ending of it, that one 
where Jane t come s out of Grauma n™s Chinese 
and sees her husband™s footprints
 and handprints, and when she™s asked her name .  She™s now a 
big movie star, and he™s gone down, and in fact 
he  committed suicide because he couldn™t stand 
his failure while she™s gone up.  And she looks 
down, and when they ask her on the radio, she 
says, ﬁThis is Mrs. Norman Maine.
ﬂ Œ and it™s a big ending in the 
movie.  Things like that, little 
bits and pieces.  It wa
sn™t awfully satisfying.  
 

By the time he was about to pick up my third opt
ion, I went in to David and I asked Da vid Œ I™d 
known hi m so well for years and years Œ my moth
er even put him, my 
mo ther really stage 
ma naged his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother r
eally sort of put them together, encouraged 
them.  And I ™ d known him since I was a kid, and 
I said, ﬁDavid, do me  a big favor, please, don™t 
pick up my option.ﬂ  And David was really very hur
t.  He said Œ he felt really insulted, and he 
said, ﬁWell, I have great plans for you.  I was th
inking that as I get older, I ma y retire, and you 
mi ght be ready to take over for me , a nd then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you 
the way you work–.ﬂ  You could see this going on until the 21
st
 century Œ a dynasty of the 
Selznicks and the Schulbergs. 
 

And I said, ﬁWell, I appreciate that, David, I really
 want to be a writer, and not really a big 
producer, like you.ﬂ  And David said, he said, 
ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁ I know we carry you on the 
payroll as a writerﬂ Œ and that hurt
 my feelings a little bit, but that ™s exac tly what he said Œ he 
said, ﬁI know we carry you on the payroll as a wr iter, 
but,ﬂ he said, ﬁI figure
 that sooner or later 
your producer™s blood would be
gin to assert itself a
nd that would kick in.ﬂ 
 

I told Scott Fitzgerald that 
anecdot e, and he used it in 
The Last Tycoon
.  It™s in 
The Last Tycoon
. 
 

So anyway, to cut this a little shor
ter, I finally did get out of ther
e.  I started writing short stories 
for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines.  And I was doing very well with that.  

And one of the short stories was 
What Makes Sammy Run?
  And I then decided that I™d like to 
put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel.  And that,  that caused me  quite a bit of 

trouble. Because for one thing, I was, I was,
 I was a young member of the  Communist Party 
(drinks) Œ  (PAUSE)  

 

Q: (Let™s start that sent ence again.) 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502

We me t secretly every week, once a week, and we 
all had lots of assignme nts.  We  wer e  very 
busy infiltrating different organizations, the Scr
eenwriters™ Guild and the Anti-Nazi League Œ all 
kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young De
mocrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, 
to infl uence them toward the communist program.
  So I asked at the me eting if I could be 
excused from my regular assignments in orde
r to Œ I™d like to stop and write this book. 
 

The answer was, ﬁI guess you™ll have to talk to Jack Lawson about thatﬂ Œ Lawson was the head 

of the communist party Œ ﬁto de
cide whether the book would be va
luable enough to the party to 
justify your dropping your assignments.ﬂ  So I 
we nt to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very 
tough, really tough and hardnosed. 

 

And Jack said, ﬁ Well, Budd, I think the only way we
 can handle this is that you ma ke an outline 
of the book, show me the outline, and then if I th
ink the book will be useful 
to the party, then I™ll 
sort of supervise the writing ofthe book.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁJesus, Jack, I can™t do that.ﬂ  And Jack 

started to give me  things about the responsibil
ity to the party.  And that went on for many, ma ny 
weeks, and I refused to do it.  And they said, ﬁNo, you have to do it, or if you–.ﬂ 

 

Finally, one day I went home  with my young wife, 
Jigee, and I said, ﬁJigee, I can™t take the 
argument any more.  It™s just eating me  up, and s o 
what I want to do is get in the car and drive 
away and just leave. And even that was, even 
that Œ people don™t realize 
how tightly disciplined 
the party was.  You couldn™t just
 get in a car and drive away. 
If you were going to New York you 
had to tell them where you were 
going.  And then if you were stay
ing mo re than two or three 
weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York.  
It was very tightly contro
lled.  So I just Œ the 
very act of getting in a car and 
driving away was a very serious de
fiance of the party discipline.   
 

And when I got back to, I went back to Dart
mouth, where I™d gone to college, and found a little 
house, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a m
onth, it was. And for the next year I worked on 
this book, Sa mmy. Meanwhile, while I was there, 
the Soviet-Nazi pact came  down, a nd that 
drove me even further from the party, because I 
felt that we all had to 
stand up to Hitler, and 
suddenly, suddenly the party people
 were saying that it™s just an
 imperialist war between the 
Germans and the English.  And we should be ne
utral and stuff, which I thought was a grave 
mi stake, also. 

 

Also, and so I was even further alienated from 
the party.  And I got the book done and, and went 
back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were
 ma d, were very ma d at me  for going and doing 
this on my own.  But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the 
People™s Worl d
, 
which was the western edition of the Daily Work
er, Charles Glenn was his name  Œ he wrote a 
rave review of the book.  He thought the book 
was the Hollywood book, if not ma ybe the great 
American novel that everyone was 
talking about Œ raved about it. 
 

That caused a firestorm a pparently. They calle
d him in and they gave him hell Œ Lawson and 
company.  Two weeks later he re-reviewed the bo
ok and he said, ﬁOn further considerationﬂ Œ 
and he even said, ﬁIt™s been pointed out to me  
the shortcomings,ﬂ and he absolutely trashed the 

book.  Apparently they had threatened him that if he
 didn™t, if he didn™t do that he would be fired 
from the paper and ma ybe even kicked out of the 
party.  He had to do it, and so he just trashed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
6 
 
 
the book.  It was a terrible book.  It didn™t do that 
and it di dn™t do that. It wa s really di sgraceful, 
just disgraceful. 
 

Q: (Was there a direct connection be tween that
 experience and your later decision when faced 
with testifying?) 

 

Yeah. The funny thing is, while the, while th
e communists were denouncing me , Sa m Goldwyn 
fired me . He  was just in a rage.  When I came i
n, he screamed at me.  It was almost like that 
Judge Freisler.  And he screamed at me .  ﬁ You™re 
a traitor!  You™re a trai
tor!ﬂ Li ke that, he got 
purple, he wa s so ma d.  ﬁHow could you write that terrible book?!ﬂ he
 screamed at me .   
 

And then, at the Motion Picture Pr
oducers Association meeting, that 
Œ my father of course was a 
me mber and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old 
partner, was now an enem
y of my father.  He 
took off the same  way, a nd he said, ﬁB.P. I blam
e  you for this.  You should have stopped him.  
It™s your fault.ﬂ  He was yelling, too.  You have 
no idea how outraged they we
re about this thing. 
 

My father said, ﬁLouis, I did try 
to stop him.  I wr ote him a lett
er begging him not to publish the 
book.ﬂ  I still have that letter, 
by the way, that my father wrote 
me .  ﬁIf you publish this book, it 
will ruin you.  You™ll never be able to live.  You™ll never get a job here again.  And not only that, 

it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother Œ who was 
just entering the agency Œ it will hurt the 
whole fa mily.  You™ve got to put Œ don™
t publish the book.ﬂ  My father wrote that. 
 

Anyway, Louis Mayer said Œ he 
said, ﬁYou know what I 
think we should do with him? ﬂ  He said, 
ﬁI think we should deport him.ﬂ  A
nd he really meant it.  It was r
eally sort of fascinating, because 
I always said that Hollywood in those days was 
like its own country.  They
 thought of it as their 
own country.  It was like Luxembour g or some thing.  They ran that country.  And they could do 
anything they wanted.  The, the district attorne
y, Huron Fitz was his name.  He was on a weekly 
salary.  They paid him every week.  And they c
ould do anything. They could cover up any crime.  
It never got in the paper. Cl
ark Gable drunkenly killed some b
ody.  He did.  And no one every 
heard about it.  Nothing.  Because they ran ever
ything, including the press. It was really their 
country.  So when Mayer said that Œ it reall
y, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mi nd, I should be 
deported. And my father Œ I always said my fath
e r  was much more intelligent than Louis, he 
knew so mu ch more, but he wasn™t as smart in a pr
actical way as Louis was.
  And my father said, 
ﬁLouis,ﬂ he said, ﬁmaybe you™re right, but,ﬂ he
 said, ﬁwhere do you thin
k his St. Helena should 
be?ﬂ  He said, ﬁMaybe we should deport hi m to Catalina Island.ﬂ 
 

And according to my father, some  of the producer
s laughed, but Louis didn™t think that was a bit 
funny.  So it was really an odd thing, I was be
ing deported, really, a
nd, and uh, blacklisted, by 
both the Hollywood moguls and the 
communist moguls, both.  It wa
s from both extremes.  So I 
went back to New York, and Œ of course, by that
 time , I felt the die was cast.  And then, from 
then on, which pretty mu ch I™ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction wr iter and so forth, 

which I™ve tried to do. 

 

Q: (Remind us how old you were at
 that time Œ you were very young.) 
 

I was about 25. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502

(Drinks)   

 

Q: (So wait till you™re finished w
ith the water– Tell us again th
at you we re twenty five years 
old.  I mean, that™s a vulnerable time to be so berated by everyone around you.) 

 

Yeah.  That book changed my life co
mpletely.  It even cost me  ha
rmony with my first love of my 
life, my wi fe, Jigee, Virginia.  It even cost 
me  the ma rriage in a way, because Jigee wanted to 
stay west.  She didn™t like the ea
st.  And she thought the climate 
was bad for our little daughter 
Vicky, and we sort of argued about that, back 
and forth.  And the, sh
e insisted, almost, on, on, 
that we live out there.  And I wa
s saying, ﬁI can™t live out there.  
It™s over for me  there.  And in 
the east, I™m really accepted now
.  And I have a new contract for a book, and I™m Œ my new life 
has begun.ﬂ 

 

It really planted the seeds of
 our breaking up eventually.  That book changed me  in every 
possible way.  It was really funny. 

 

Q: (Give us a sense of the 
chronology when it was published, and then, if you could move 
forward to the war, which obviously changed things for everybody, right?) 

 

I started the book in the spring of
 ‚39.  I finished it in the, 
about fall of, of 1940.  It was 
published, uh, on my birthday, uh, in 1941.  And uh, 
and then, then I was working on my, I was 
back in       Vermont.  I was starting my s
econd book.  And then came Pearl Harbor, and we were 
in the war.  And then I, I was anxious to get in 
the war, and I, uh, I applied to the Marine Corps.  
Uh, and then I, I went back to Hollywood to see 
my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke 
to the, John Ford, the famous movie director.  Fo
rd was forming this outfit, the Œ called the Navy 
OSS Photographic Unit that would work with th
e, in the OSS with, w
ith  photographic in- 
intelligence.  And because of my
 book™s success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me , he said he 
would like me  to be in that unit. So that™s
 what happened.  I then applied, with his 
recommendation.  And that took about six months before I was approved. 

 

And in the meanti me , I went down to Mexico an
d waited in Mexico and wrote screenplays to 
support myself, wrote screenplays down th
ere, for Mexican producers.      
 

And then finally I was, I got my Navy commissi
on and went to Wa shington to report to John 
Ford.  And that was the beginning of my war expe
rience.  I wa s in, in for about four years, 
because after the war, I 
was with the Nuremberg Trial.  It se
ems to me , I think it was fr om spring 
of ‚42 to spring of ‚46 before I got, before I got
 out, because the last si x or seven mo nths was 
spent preparing a film for the Nuremberg, th
e photographi c evidence for the trial.   
 

Q: (Tell us a bit more about John Ford™s role.  So you went into the Navy, because he was  in the 

Navy, and he already was for ming this unit.)    

 

Yes.  Exactly. 

 

Q: (But was it solely Navy personnel?) 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
8 
 
 
 
No.  It was not.  It could have been anywhere.  It
 could have been Marine, 
or Army.  I think that 
Jack just had contacts with the Navy.  He wa
s a friend of Bill Donovan, the OSS head, of the 
newly for med OSS.  And, so it was a Navy outfit that
 really wa s, didn™t really have very much to 
do with the Navy.   

 

At the same time, there were some really ridicu
lously funny things like at our headquarters in 
Washington, at the Agricultural Building, if you 
wanted to go out for lunch, you would go to the 
Marine Sergeant and say, ﬁPermi ssion to go ashore, 
Sir.ﬂ  We  had all this naval talk, even though 
we never saw a ship.  But, Ford did send me  for na
val training anyway, to Fort Schuyler.  I went 
to Fort Schuyler and got Navy 
indoctrination, where I had some  
trouble with navigation and all 
these things, I wasn™t very good at that. 

 

Q: (Tell us about John Ford and your story abou
t his erratic responses 
to you in terms of 
requiring Navy behavior.) 

 

John Ford, of course he was a geni
us, but he had a, I think he had 
a kind of sadistic trait. Because 
when I came  in to report Œ I™d known him in Ho
llywood, and I was still thinking of him as a 
movie director and me  as a young writer.  So I walk
ed in and said, ﬁHi Jack, I™m here, like, what 
do you want me  to do?ﬂ   It was sort of like th
at.  And Ford was now a 
Navy Commander, and he 
said, ﬁEnsign Schulberg, that™s no way to report
 to your comma nder.  Come  to attention and 
salute and make an official report.ﬂ  And so
 on.  I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, ﬁEnsign 
Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.ﬂ 
And he™s said, ﬁThat™s more like 
it.ﬂ  So he™s like a standard 
stiff-necked Navy commander.  It wa
s so typical Ford, so I say, OK, 
if that™s what he wants, I™ll 
do it.  I don™t care.   

 
So the next time  I come  into his office I gi
ve him a sal–and say, ﬁE
nsign Schulberg reporting 
for duty, Sir.ﬂ  John Ford says to me , ﬁOh, for 
Christ™s sake, Budd, you don™t have to go through 
all that.  Sit down.  Let™s talk.ﬂ 
 Li ke now he™s just a movie dir
ector again.  That™s the way he 
was.  He loved to keep people off balance.  Th
at was a big thing with 
Ford, to keep them off 
balance.  Whatever you thought he was going 
to say, he™d say some thing different.   
 
But he took glee in, and he sai
d, ﬁWe™re going to send you to Fo
rt Schuyler, and they™ll really 
knock some  Navy discipline into
 you.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYou™re going to find it very tough.ﬂ  He 
couldn™t wait for me  to suffer there, at Fort Sc
huyler.  And so I went to Sc huyler Œ I didn™t mi nd 
it really, I found it rather intere
sting. Tough, but Œ and we™d run ar
ound the Fort at 6 o™clock in 
the morning and go all through this stuff,
 and so it was sort of interesting. 
 

And one really funny thing happened there.   

 

There were two little ensi gns fr om the South. 
 One was name d Wa tts and the other was name d 
Furr.  One came  from M i ssissippi and the other fr
om Georgia.  And they would always stare at 
me .  I™d be doing some thing and they™d l
ook up and they were staring at me .   

 

And one night after me ss, I came back to my bunk, and they came  over, and they said, ﬁExcuse 

me , Schulberg, would you mi nd if we talk to you?ﬂ 
 And I said, ﬁ Well, no.ﬂ  So they sat down 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
9 
 
 
opposite me  in this little bunk. And I said, ﬁOK, 
what do you want to talk about? ﬂ   And they 
said, in that thick sout hern accen
t, I can™t do it, they said: ﬁSom
eone told us that you were a 
Jew.ﬂ  And they said, ﬁYou know, we™ve never seen 
one before.ﬂ  It was li
ke looking at a koala 
bear from Australia or some thing, and they™d never seen one before.   
 

And then they, and then we got to chatting a bit.  
And then they Œ they were very polite.  He said, 
ﬁ Well, Sir, if you don™t mi nd our asking,ﬂ Furr 
said, ﬁWhat do you do in civilian life?ﬂ  And I 
said, ﬁWell, I™m a writer.ﬂ  And Furr said, ﬁA writer
.  That™s interesting.ﬂ 
 He said, ﬁWe™ve got a 
coupleﬂ Œ he came from Oxford, Mi
ssissippi Œ he said, ﬁWe™ve got 
a couple of writers in our 
town.ﬂ  And I said, and I said, ﬁYou mean Fa
ulkner? ﬂ   And he said, ﬁYeah, the Faulkner 
brothers, the brothers.ﬂ     

 

He said, ﬁYou know, those two guysﬂ Œ he said, ﬁI™m
 a druggist.ﬂ  He worked in a drug store, 
and his whole view of Faulkner Œ he said, ﬁThese
 two Faulkner brothers,ﬂ he said, ﬁalmost every 

morning, they come  in and buy aspirin, because they™ve got such bad headaches, because they 

drink so damn much at night.ﬂ  That was his Œ  

 

And I said, ﬁWellﬂ Œ and I said, ﬁWilliam Faul
kner?   You know William Faulkner?ﬂ  And he 
said, ﬁWell sure, I see him every mor ning.ﬂ  He said, ﬁHow do you know him? ﬂ   He had no idea 

that he was fa mous.  He just thought he was 
a crazy guy in town.  They had no idea he was a 
fa mous writer.  They were so funny.  They used to– 

 

After that, they would, whenever they saw me  
Œ I should write about them some  time Œ they 

would Œ(Drinks) 

 

Umm, whenever they saw me , they would say, ﬁH
i, Schulberg,ﬂ and then they™d look at each 
other, be sort of pleased.  It was like that, I mea
n, it was just  a, I was just a bizarre thing to them.  

I didn™t feel really anti-Semitism, it was just, simp
ly, they had never seen one, that™s all. ----------
------(? ) or some thing. It was so– 

 

And the final exam - it was just murder.  You, you 
had to chart the, chart the passage of a ship, 
and you get all these instructions, th
irty knots at this and then left
 to here and right to there, 
trying to take it from this one place all the wa
y through the canal, to docking.  And I didn™t know 

what the hell I was doing.  I was sweating.  I sai
d, ﬁI™m going to flunk this 
thing, Ford is going to 
kill me.ﬂ  I couldn™t do it.   

 

I swear to God, as I™m sweating this out, Furr an
d Wa tts are sitting right
 across the aisle from 
me , and I see a hand comi ng in surreptitiously, a
nd he shows me  his paper so I could copy it and 
pass.  They saved me .  They saved me Œ Furr and Wa
tts.  God, they were sort of lovable, really.  
I™m sure when they went home , big stories a
bout how they met this 
Jew.  Now we know one, 
like, we really saw one. 

 

Q: (How are we doing on tape time?  Time ?   OK) 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502

So, then I came  back from Fort Schuyler, and Ford
 called me  in and said Œ well, by this time I™m 
really snapping, I™m really Navy. I™ve been there 
for three months or some thing.  And I™m very 
snapped up.  
 

And Ford the sadist said, ﬁ Well, how™d you like 
that? ﬂ   And I said, ﬁG
ee, I really loved it, 
Commander , it was great.ﬂ  It was sort of layi
ng into him, and he wanted me  to say, God, I 

suffered there or some thing.  He was not ha
ppy Œ he thought I was su
ffering there at Fort 
Schuyler.  

 

But after that , after that, the fi rst nine or ten m
onths or almost a year, 
we worked just in, in 
Washington. And Ford had ma de a fi lm about, a 
film for public consumption about, about Pearl 
Harbor, and he asked me  to write the, sort of the co mmentary, the narr ation, I mean, titles and 

stuff, and so on. I worked on films like that, wh
ich was more  or less like working in Hollywood.  
And, then he sent me  overseas to London. I was 
there in the blitz, and we did some , some  
undercover work in, in London, and then Paris.  

 

And then we had some  really interesting a
ssignments.  One was not really involved in 
photography. We  were part of a l
ittle group that, as soon as a Germ
an town fell, we would rush 
in and try to grab as much information Œ we w
ould go to the SS headquart
ers and things like that 
and grab papers and orders and things like th
at.  It was interesti
ng.  It wa s interesting. 
 

Q: (Was this in 1943?   ™44?) 

 

Yes, I™d say this was ‚43, ‚44, yes, as we
 moved through Belgium and into Germany.   
 

And then they used writers in a ve ry creative wa
y.  They had writers like me  work with, on the 
team that would drop, dr op agents behind the line.
  And each agent had about, a team of about 
eight that took care of th
em.  They al l had different assignmen
ts.  One would just Œ took care of 
his general welfare. And, and one was involved 
in the aviation problems, when he could be 
dropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that
.  And I as a writer would work on their cover 
story, which was very much like writing a stor y.  It was exac tly like writing a character in 

fiction, because you would fi
nd out what they really did, and then
 just adjust it to what they 
would say when they got, if they were interr
ogated.  And so that was really interesting. 

 

Right before the end of the war, we had one, 
one guy who wa s a Danish agent.  I was just 
amazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people.  And he™d become  quite famous. He had 

been actually dropped in Berlin or some thing, or got
 to Berlin.  He went to the Adlon Hotel, and 
became a big pal of some big SS general.  He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some  

kind  Œ I forget what the hell they thought he was selling Œ but he became a pal and dr inking 

buddy, and so Œ. 

 

Now it was quite near the end of the war, and hi
s ma in worry was that the war mi ght end before 
he could do 50 drops. He really wa
s worried that the war would be 
over.  He couldn™t wait to get 
his fiftieth in.  And, but three days
 before, three or four days befo
re the end of the war, back he 
went again.  I asked him, it™s agains
t regulations really, because everyt
hing is so secret.  But if he 

ever survived, if he ever came to
 the States, I™d love to know what happene d to him.  Because it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
11 
 
 
was frustrating.  When we did this work, when 
they ma de contact inside, they ma de some one, 
not us, but just some one, in London I think it was,
 so we would never know what happened, we 
didn™t know whether they got killed
 or were doing great.  We  neve
r could sort of complete the 
experience.  So I asked him, if he eve r  got out, if 
he survived this last one,
 and got to the States, I 
wish he would look me  up and tell me what the 
hell happened to him.  
But  I never heard from 
him.  I don™t know what happened to him.  

 

Q: (So you had intelligence training,
 also Œ not just naval traini
ng, but intelligen
ce training?) 
 

That™s right, so they sent me to that school; it™
s the same  place where the CI A is now.  Yeah, that 
was interesting.  They sent me  to a school.  Ther
e were a hundred or so ag
ents, at agent school.  
We were there about a couple of mo nths, and each
 one had to ma ke up a false identity, as to who 
they were and what they did.  And they just went, funny things Œ 

 

I said I was a sports writer. You 
had to of course choose somethi
ng that you could talk about, or 
be questioned about, that they didn
™t know enough about, to pass.  So 
I said I was a sports writer.  
I didn™t say Los Angeles, but close 
to Los Angeles, like Alta    
   ,  that I knew enough about. 
 

Sometimes at three o™clock in the morning, 
they would wake you up and shake you and say, 
ﬁ What™s your name ?   What do you do? ﬂ  Œ kind of like that, to try and catch you.  And 

fascinating, too, every Sa turday night there was 
a long drinking session.  Th
ey would all be at a 
long table, and they had every kind of booze on th
e table, and they would encourage people to 
drink.  And they would see who fell apart in dr
inking, and who didn™t.  And they would weed 
them out like that. 

 

Q: (Were you good at that? ) 
 
Yeah, I was.  Yeah, I had had quite a bit 
of training in it by then.  Yes, I was. 
 

Yes, I passed the whole thing. 

 

Q: (Better at drinking than navigati
on.  They have to change tapes, 
so we can take a little break.  
Did I hear you right?) 

 

So I came back from that–. 

 
END of Tape 1 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
12 
 
 
 
Tape 2 of 3: 
 
 Q: (Why don™t you tell me how Stuart was br
ought into the unit a
nd when that was?) 
 

Well, Stuart joined the Marine Corps. And af
ter his Marine training Œ the same  tough stuff Œ 
even tougher ma ybe that he went through Œ he was 
assigned to a film unit, a film unit in the 
Marine Corps.  Meantime, I heard that we™d a slot open in our outfit.  Some one had dropped out. 

I forget what happened to him.  Anyway, I then
 recommende d to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart, 
I said he was really very, very 
able.  And so they did suggest to
 Stuart that he apply, and Ford 
approved it, and so forth.  And so Stuart came ove r, and from t hat time  wor ked with us.  And 

that™s how we both happened to be, at the end 
of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial 
preparation. 

 

Q: (Just a little background: Did you work at 
all with the Signal Corps?   Did you have any 
connection or cooperation with the Signal Corp
s units, and with Geor
ge Stevens™ unit?) 
 

No, we had no connection whatsoever with the Si gnal 
Corps.  It drives me  a little crazy, because 
it will never get straightened out
, I don™t think. Some how on the In
ternet it says that George 
Stevens worked on the Nuremberg film.  And I 
get questions many time s: How was it to work 
with George Stevens?   And he seems  inextri
cably bound up in our project.  I didn™t even know, 
know George Stevens.  I know his son quite we
ll, but I don™t think I even ever me t George 
Stevens. And he had nothing whatsoever to do with our project.  Nothing.   

 

What he did, and where it got mi xed up is that, ap
parently Stevens, at the end of the war got a 
film unit and went around photographing the concen
tration camps, and made several films that 
were, I think, quite effective. But of course that
 was not involved at all in the Nuremb erg Trial. 
 

For one thing, as I me ntioned last night, we could only use film that the Ge rmans themselves had 

shot and prepared, so anything 
that George Stevens 
did with our army people would not be 
admi ssible evidence.  But we never saw George St
evens.  And I don™t think 
I™ll ever be able to 

disconnect it.  It come s up constan
tly.  It™s right there, if you fi
nd it Œ  George Stevens worked on 
this.   

 

It™s one of the ma ny, many troubles 
with the Internet, that™s really
 a big negative for me.  I get 
asked questions about Hollywood, about, did I get b
ack to Hollywood work b
ecause I testified to 
the committee after the war, and I didn™t go anyw
here near Hollywood.  I still felt outlawed, 
understand.  And I lived in, in Bucks C
ounty, Pennsylvania, and just wrote books. 

 

But all that mi sinformation is set in th
ere, and it will be there forever.   

 

Q: (I agree.) 

 

And I™m sur e  there™ll be biographi
es written full of mi sinforma tion. 
 

Q: (OK, So George Stev
ens had nothing to do with 
The Nazi Plan
.) 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
13 
 
 
 
Nothing. 

 

Q: (And did George Stevens and 
his group have anything to do w
ith John Ford and his unit?) 
 

Nothing.  Zero. Nothing.  They were two complete
ly separate Œ I think th
at Stevens apparently 
did some  very good work, but it had nothing to 
do with John Ford™s OSS unit.  Nothing. 

 

Q: (OK. Wh y don™t you tell us, 
give us some  detail about ho
w it came about, your suggestion 
about photographic evidence, and when you firs
t came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to 
that.)  

 

At the end of the war, after the war was, was 
over, General Bill Donovan was very interested in, 
was one of the first, I think, to be strongly in fa
vor of an international 
tribunal to try the major 
war criminals.  And he, he called a meeting Œ 

  

I need some water, too, cause my mo uth 
gets dry from talking so much. ( Drinks) 
 

He called a meeting of, of a
ll the various OSS departme nts to discuss how the OSS could 
contribute to the building of an 
international trial.  And agai
n, Ray Kellogg, ma ybe Ford, but I 
worked muc h more closely with Kellogg than I di
d with Ford Œ Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford 
mi ght ma ke suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but
 Kellogg was my i mmediate superior.  So I 
guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking 

about the importance of the impending trial. And 
he felt that the OSS was logically set up to 
make a major contri bution to thei r intelligence work 
and all the rest of it.  I got the feeling at the 
meeting that, that I think Donovan saw hi ms elf as 
the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor.  
I think he really hoped to have the job that 
eventually went to Ju
stice Robert Jackson. 
 

Anyway, each one spoke up about what they coul
d do, and naturally, comi ng from the Film OSS 
Photographic Œ it was only logical
 to say that ma ybe there was 
photographic evidence that we 
could use at, at a trial.  

 

As a result of that meeting, Kellogg then put me  
in, in charge of a photographic team that would 
look, search for and gather and ed
it and present the photographic eviden
ce at the trial. And so, so 
I – Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, 
where the OSS was headquartered, and, and Œ with 
my brother Stuart, to be in char
ge of the still photographic evidence.
  So, he set up in, I think in 
Wi esbaden. And Stuart got the, the cooperation 
of Hans Hoffma nn, who 
was Hitler™s official 
photographer.  And Hoffmann, who Œ oddly eno
ugh, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von 
Schirach, the, who was on 
trial, the head of the 
Hitlerj ugend
.  It was really ironic because in a 
sense the father in law was he
lping to hang his son in law. 
 

But as I point out Œ with all the Germans that 
we worked with they, once we won, they would do 
anything we wanted, that they were completely 
submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a 
slavish point. I mean, I was sort of disgusted with
 it, in a way.  We  woul
d say that the Œ feeling 
anti-German at that time, because we did feel
 that the country really overwhelmi ngly had 
supported Hitler. You see those cr
owds of millions and millions 
of people would turn out for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
14 
 
 
those rallies. And we said that 
we thought of the Germans as being 
either, either at your throat 
or, or at your feet.  That™s what we said.   
 

And at that point, we found them wi lling Œ that
 even for merly Nazi people would do anything 
that you, anything that you wanted, because they we
re scared of us also.  But by then we were 

the conquerors and they were scared
 about what we mi ght do to them. 
 

Q: (Was Hoffmann th
at cooperative too? ) 
 

Hoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart an
d turned over his entire
 treasure trove of 
photographs to Stuart.  Went over 
with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in 
Berlin.  (Coughing) (Drinks water) 

 

Q: (So, Budd, when did you first go to Nurember
g, to the city?  And what did you find when you 
wer e  t h er e? ) 

 

What did I find there, did you say? 

 

Q: (When di d you first get to Nuremberg? ) 

 

Very soon after we, after we set 
up headquarters in Berlin, in the 
Wa nnsee, very fancy, plush Œ it 
was like the Beverly Hills of Berli
n, I guess, in a way, or even Bellair
e.  And at that time , I, I uh, 
after we set up shop there, then because, I went 
down to Nuremberg to talk with the Jackson 
legal staff to get the particulars of the indict
me nts and find out, find out specifically what, what 
photographic, how the photographic evidence 
would, would dovetail with their actual 
indictme nts. And uh from the point
 on we worked very closely.   
 
There was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the Jackson staff Œ he was 

on Jackson™s staff, well we all were really, we 
were officially on Jack
son™s staff too Œ would 
work out the, the working arrangeme nt between 
the indictme nts and what we could do to back 
up those indictme nts photographically. 

 

And we wor ked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still s
ee from ti me  to time on the Vineyard Œ a very 
distinguished lawyer and I thi
nk a judge later, but we would 
work closely with them, and 
some ti me s I was down there frequently.  I mi ght fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I 

was in Nuremberg a lot, every, ma ybe a couple of times a we ek even, during that period when 

we were preparing the film.   

 

Q: (What was the city like? Wh
at was the atmos phere like?) 
 

Well, the city was a ruin.  It was really a wreck.  And the uh, and the Germans see me d very 

beaten down and sort of depre
ssed, and uh, and eager to please, 
really, eager to please you, and 
sort of scared of you, too.  It was very much a 
sense of the conquered and the conquerors.  But it 
was shocking to see those cities. 
 I saw Cologne, Berlin 
itself was, Jesus Œ I flew over Berlin in a 
small plane, and it looked like a honey
comb.  There was hardly a roof 
left in all of this enormous 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
15 
 
 
city.  There was hardly any roof
s on the buildings.  You could just
 see ri ght into them.  It was 
totally destroyed. 
 

Q: (Did you have any refl ections on the impact 
of Allied bombing and whether it was justified? ) 

 

Well, that™s a tough question, because really 
you mi ght say on both side
s, it really doesn™t 
seemed justified to uh bomb civilians, you know, on one
 side or the other, ju
st as the Na zis were 
doing in London, and we were doing in Dresden a
nd everywhere else.  We did destroy those 
cities.  At the time, I felt that, at  that  time I fe
lt that we had to do it, be
cause we, apparently that 
was, they thought, the only way to win the war. And God knows we had to win the war if we 

wanted to survive.  At the tim
e, at the same  time, it was really horrendous to see what we had 
done, I mean to people, and 
oh God, the wreckage of it. 
 

Q: (I™m sorry, go ahead.)  

 

When I saw Berlin, I, my  feeling 
was that it would take fifty year
s or more to ever get it back 
together.  I was amazed at how quickly they restor
ed those cities.  I was amazed at the resilienc e 
of people to rebuild them.  I thought
 it would take all through the 20
th
 century. 
 

Q: (When di d you first have real knowledge abou
t what had been going on in the concentration 
camps?) 

 

Um, trying to reme mber Œ there Œ Even before th
e war, there had been word, word had gotten out 
that there we re concentration camps, uh, in, in 19
– let™s see, what™s it in, yeah, in 1938.  Joe, 
Joe Louis™s uh, whenŠ it was a, famous story th
at, there was, you know, that was Œ Braddock™s 
ma nager wa s Jewish, and, and Goebbels was worki
ng very hard to set up a championship fight 
between Braddock the champion and Max Schmeli
ng in Germany.  And Joe Gould, the ma nager 
Œ I went to see him in the hospital shortly before
 he died. And whether he ma de it up or not, Joe 
Gould told me  that, that he got a phone call 
from Schmeling in Germany, and Max was dying to 
set up this rema tch with Louis.  And, so he called.  Joe Gould was actually at, at Stillman™s Gym 
when he got the call.  And Schmeling said, ﬁJ
oe, I™m here with, with, I™m here with Mr. 
Goebbels in his office, and he would like to talk
 to you.ﬂ  And so there wa s Goebbels in Berlin 
talking to this little Jewish guy in Stillma n™s 
Gym.  And of course now, it sounds ma de up, but 
what, what Joe Gould told me  that day in the hos
pital was that, he said, Goebbels said, ﬁ We™re 
very anxious to arrange a championship ma tch be
tween your fighter and our
 fighter, in Berlin, 
and we, and we want to know what your conditions
 are.ﬂ  And Gould said, ﬁ Well first, I want 
500,000 dollars in a New York bank before we leave.
ﬂ And he said that Goebbels said, ﬁ Well, 
that™s no problem.ﬂ  

 

And he said, ﬁAnd also, we want, 
one judge must be American, and we want an English referee.ﬂ  
And he said, ﬁ Well, just a mi nute, I™ll have to 
ask Mr. Schmeling.ﬂ Then he came back he said, 
ﬁMr Schmeling says that™s OK, too.ﬂ  And then he
 said, ﬁAnd we want ten first class passages, 
and, and first class accommodation for ten people in
 your best hotel,ﬂ and so on. And he said, 
ﬁAlright  that™ll be alright. Is ther e any other condition?ﬂ 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
16 
 
 
Gould said that he said, ﬁ Well, there™s just one 
more.  We ™d like you to release all, all the Jews 
from your concentration camps.ﬂ  
 

So that was ™38.  So by that time  we were hear
ing rumors about the concentration camps. It was 
beginning to get out.  They were 
just starting. I™m not sure exac
tly when they set them up. But 
there were only a few in the beginning. Ithink Dachau was one of the early ones. 

 

Incidentally I, getting ready for the Nuremberg trial,
 I went to the Dachau tr
ial as an observer.  I 
didn™t work on the trial, in fact, 
I was an observer at the trial. 
 

Q: (And that was for the OSS?)  

 

Pardon me ?  

 

Q: (For the OSS? ) 

 

For the OSS, yes, everything I did wa s 
on behalf of our OSS unit, yes, yeah. 
 

Q: (OK, so let™s jump in.  The war ends, th
ey undertake this incredibly ambitious  Œ ) 
  

Very.  It had never b
een done before, never 
 

Q: ( -- and so fast, so fast.  So
 talk to me  about what they wa
nted from you, how you could do it 
in the time there was.  Te ll us about that.) 

 

They were building a case that the Nazis and 
Hitler had conspired almost from the beginning, 
almost from 1933 on, to breach the Tr eaty of Versai
lles and to find ways to get around it.  And 
so they had these, ma ny different steps of the 
indictme nt Œ of crimes against humanity, and, and 
crimes against the existing peace of the world, and 
so forth.  There was a whole series of them. 
And for each one I would sit 
down with Donovan, some ti mes w
ith Ray Kellogg in attendanc e 
also Œ Ray served as sort of an intermed
iary between Donovan and me  Œ and Donovan would 
spell out, out for us what the indictme nts were, s
how us, in fact I would read them, and then ask 
us, ﬁHow do you think that you see film building or 
buttressing the case that we™re ma king? ﬂ   So, 
so I would go away with that info
rmation and then, then look for f
ilm that would answer his, his, 
what he was looking for.  So... 
 

Q: (Where did you look first? ) 

 

Stupidly, we, as a shortcut, because
 we were very, very worried a
bout time Œ at that time it was 
like August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15
th
 of September.  We had no time. So 
we got, so as a shortcut, we t
hought we™d look at all the Fox Movi
etone footage, because actually 
that was produced, had come from Germany, and so
 we got all of that, an
d it, I thought it didn™t 
answer all, all the things he was asking for, but 
some  of the m. And so I, I went down with a list.  
And at that point Donovan, Jim Do
novan said, ﬁWell, Budd, that™s f
ilm that was released in the 
United States. Even though the source was Germ
an, we can™t use anything that was at the 
influence, say, of Fox Movietonews
, because the defense attorneys 
would jump in and say ‚That, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
17 
 
 
that™s not admi ssible evidence, it mi ght have been
 doctored,™ if they can™t
 tell what happened to 
it, and so forth.  It has to be only German fi
l m, made in Germany, photographed by the Germans, 
official Germans, too Œ the army or the Wa ffen 
SS people and so on.ﬂ  It ma de our job so much 
more difficult.  I wasn™t sure 
we could really do it at all.  

 

And then we heard that that film was, the German
 film was all in the Russian sect or, which made 
it even more difficult for us.  

 

It™s sort of a long story, Raye, but
 I went to the head of the Ru
ssian archives, this unusual ma n, 
uh, Major Avenerius he was, and I told him what we
 were looking for, and as I said last night, 
he, he asked me , well, he said, ﬁDid you come  up  from the John Ford unit? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYes,ﬂ 

and he said, ﬁ Well, that™s very 
interesting.ﬂ  And it turned out 
that he was a John Ford scholar.  
He knew every, he really knew every Ford movi e. 
 He name d them, he must have name d twenty 

of them or more, every single one,
 all the way back to the early 
20s.  He knew the obscure silent 
films.  He knew every damned shot.  It turned
 out he was a– He was like really basically a 
civilian, and he™d been a professor at the film
 institute in Moscow, and John Ford was his 
favorite of all world directors.  John Ford was 
his favorite director.  He
 knew everything about 
Ford.   

 

And he found it very interesting th
at Ford was the commande r of th
e outfit.  And he asked me  if 
Ford would be comi ng, and I said ﬁWell, yes he mi
ght come , just to inspect what we™re doing.ﬂ  
And he said, ﬁ Would you introduce me  to hi m? ﬂ  All his life he™d wanted to meet John Ford.  I 

said, ﬁWell, sure, if he come s.  I think he ma y 
come.ﬂ  And with that, th
at opened the door.  He 
told me  to come  back in the morning. And he 
opened up to us only, Germa n, not all but a lot of 
the German newsreel film that they
 had shot themselves, and that we
, a great deal of that record, 
the whole record of the gr owth of the Nazis and their comi ng to power of
ficially through that 
strange uh, actually through an el
ection, and all th
e rest of it. 
 

So much of that film that we got from hi m 
the next day [coughs] we got because of the John 
Ford connection.  We  actually got a truck and loaded the truck with film.  We had, we only 

showed four hours at the trial 
but we had ma ybe forty or fi
fty hours.  We  had hundreds and 
hundreds, hundreds of thousands of feet Œ it ma y ha
ve been as much as a million feet, I swear to 

God. 

 

Q: (Do you want to clear your thro
at?   And then I™d like to have you go back and tell us Œ This 
was at the Ba belsberg studio, right?   Mention 
where Avenerius was taking you.  And also, talk 
about, you were presumably working on 35mm film, 
which is very unwieldy.  Let™s go back into 
that, so you can tell us where, and some  of t
hose things about the film conditions, and how you 
could handle film, both viewing it, copyi
ng it, all of that.  So, go ahead.) 
 

Well, we got so much of this film from hi m, as I me ntioned last night, and after a few days of 

this, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff.  Apparently his colone l had 

objected to his giving us so mu
ch film, even though the Soviet Un
ion was one of the four parties 
represented in the prosecution. 
But the colonel stopped it. And 
then, I won™t go into so much 
detail, but then we had to win ove
r the colonel, which we did with this lavi sh part y that  we threw 
for him, an a ll night into th
e dawn party.  When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
18 
 
 
and we showed them the July 20
th
 trial, which they were very in
terested in, and they wanted a Œ 
we had that and they didn™t Œ 
and they wanted a copy of that, 
which we would ma ke for them.  
And so, softened up, the colonel then gave us perm
ission to drive way into the Soviet sector. And 
it was on that  trip that  Œ which the Russians said it was the furthest  any Americans had been 
allowed in to penetrate the Sovi
et sector Œ they knew of this
 tunnel where film had – I should 
backtrack. 

 

My two, my  two SS fil m editors Œ we had recr
uited them from a POW camp Œ Wa lter Rothe and 
Curt von Molo were their name s - and they told
 us that there were films ma de of, actually 
showing the Jews being shoved into cattle cars
 and ripped of their ri
ngs and jewelry and, and 
various atrocious things that th
e SS were doing to these poor Jewish victims. And, they had both 
worked on those, edited those films, and had shown them to Goebbels and Hi mmler, and 

obscenely, they called them ‚desserts,™ because th
ey would be shown after dinner like a dessert 
in a Œ I guess as an amusement, partly an amuse ment but partly it was supposed to be reporting.  

These were like SS reports on what they were acco
mplishing.  And they told us that there were a 
great ma ny of these films. And th
e Russians sa id that they mi ght be in this place, where they™d 

been sort of sealed up in a tunnel.  And they did 
take us there, and it was on fire. It was burning.  
It was almost, it, it was, God, it 
looked like acres of fil m wer e
 burning.  We did pick up little 
pieces.   

 

And then they told us about two, two places 
in the sector , one called Rossleben and, and 
Rudersdorf Œ two small towns where the same  thing. They would apparently ma ke a tunnel into a 

mountainside or a hills
ide, and then seal up this
 film. And they were hiding it.  And, and so we 
drove to both places.  And in both places, of 
course, Rossleben and Rudersdorf, we found the 

same  thing that we had found in the Russian sect
or.  The film was burning, or had been burned Œ 
acres of it.  It was huge.  And once again, we we
re cheated out of getting what would ha ve been 
just invaluable stuff.  And again, we picked up he
re and there Œ it would be 
like a foot of, of fil m 
that was Œ you could see what it was if you held it 
to the light.   And we did find some  of that and 
ma de copies of it and, and brought that, andbrought that down to Nuremb erg.  But I wa s 
convinced by this having happened three time s th
at someone must be informing them that, that 
we were comi ng to get it. 

 

Q: (So what you™re saying really suggests that
 even though there was offi
cially a prohibition on 
filming any of these kinds of activities, thes
e guys were telling you 
that it was filmed.) 
 

Oh yes. 

 

Q: (Presumably this was film that
 was kept highly secret, right? ) 
 

Yes, Yes 

 

Q: (And not some thing that went th
rough the Propaganda Ministry. )  
 

No. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
19 
 
 
Q: (Well that™s one question. And the other part is
 Œ these acres of fil ms, was it your feeling that 
some of that was offi cial German film, like the Goebbels empire, or that these were all SS film 
locations?) 

 

I don™t know if they all were, because we really c
ouldn™t, we were not able to examine them the 
way that we would have wished t
o, but I got the feeling that these 
were more SS films that they 
were hiding, rather than the Goebbels propaganda
 films.  But there mi ght have been some  of 
both.  I really don™t know.  I 
really don™t know the answer. 
 

Q: (But tell us again wher
e the German ne wsreel ma te
rial was that you found.) 
 

Well, that we  found mos tly in the Babelsberg, wher
e, that Avenerius was in
 charge of.  Most of 
that film came from there that they had Œ all of 
the newsreel film that had been shot all, all 
through the war, from the early days. 

 

Q: (Do you reme mber where you found the film
 of the trial of the bomb plotters?) 
 

Yes, I do. It, it was, I really, pr
actically found that myse
lf, with a couple of people with me .  We  
Œ It was a film lab, and in the baseme nt we found a
bout twenty, twenty reels 
of film, and so I just 
took it with us and went back and 
started to run it.  We  didn™t know what was in it, and there was 
the whole God damned t r ia
l of the plotters.   
 

I was rather surprise
d, seeing the film did, 
The Nazi Plan
, which had only a snippet of the trial, 
that I can™t reme mber why that was chosen, beca
use there were far more shocking scenes than 
that one that we showed, that was not as 
abusive as some .  I don™t know why that one– 
 
For some  reason, Donovan, at first he didn™t want to
 use any of the film.  
He thought that crimes 
against their own people would not be as germane. I didn™t really understand it, because after all 
we were using film of the anti
-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people.  I 
never really agreed with him.  I don™t 
know what his reticence was about that. 

 

Q: (Well, I wonder if it had anything to do with th
e fact that the people on
 trial for trying to kill 
Hitler were not the defendants in the dock at Nu
remberg.  This was a re
ally opposite polarity.) 
 

Well, that™s true.  And Judge Frei
sler was not Œ God he was a horribl
e, but it™s true he was not on 
trial. 

 

Q: (I think he was killed in an
 Allied bombing raid, actually, 
while he was in a courtroom.) 
 

Freisler, I think he was. I think he was kill
ed. Thank God, he was a, God what a horrible–. 
 

Q: (I share your, your passionate horror for th
at trial footage.  I know it very well.) 
 

That trial was some thing.  Then also–   I don™t th
ink, I don™t think I spoke about it last night, but 
the, our, our SS editors told us that the, uh, the uh, July 20
th
 people, in being convicted, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
20 
 
 
were actually hung alive on meat hooks, big meat hooks, 
and just put like that 
and left to die.  
And that was photographed. That was photographed.  
 

Q: (Filmed?)  

 

Filmed, I mean, yes, filmed. And the idea was th
at they would show that to every, in every 
diplomatic center, show it to a
ll the diplomats, Nazi diplomat
s and High Command pe ople, as a 
way of frightening them against doing some thing lik
e that again.  What we heard was that it, it 
sort of backfired.  It was so horri
fying that they were afraid it 
would turn more people against the 
regime  and they stopped circulating it. 

 

And of course we were dying to get hold of that film. We we re 
told that some one had actually 
sold it to some one in, in Switzer
land, and so I went to Switzerland, went to Bern and to Basel, 
trying to find out if I could get 
the film.  And a guy, a guy came  to 
my hotel and said that he had 
the film, and, and he asked me  how much I would 
pay for it.  And I forget what I said Œ I had 
been told, I think, that we could go up to 5000. 
 I think I started at 
2500.  And he said, he 
wouldn™t even think of it for 2500, and then we got up to 5000. And he came back and said, 

ﬁI™ve got other people interested 
also, in it and I think they mi ght be willing to pay more than 
5000.ﬂ  And then I only had permission for five
, so I had to call Ray Kellogg and find out how 

much more we could pay than 5000.
  And it took time and red tape, 
and meanwhile this little guy 
came back.  I waited there in the 
hotel, and he came  back and looked at me , and I think he asked 
some  exorbitant amount like 10,000.  I said, well, I 
don™t have that yet.  And he said, ﬁWell, I 
have someone who™s willing to pay and I™ve deci
ded not to co me  back any more, and I™m going 
to sell it to him.ﬂ  And a pparently they did.   

 

Apparently it was Nazi people in Spain, where a 
great ma ny had been able to reach and survive, 
and they bought it.  And I went back empty-ha
nded.  I was very disappo
inted I didn™t get the 
film. If they™d given me enough money, if they
 had said 20,000–  It was almost, it was like 

buying a Hollywood story, but Œ going back to my 
boss to ask how much money can I give him.  
 

Q: (Was he a German?  Was this little man a Ger man?) 

 

No, I thought he was Swiss.  I thought he was Swiss and not Ge rman. 

 

Q: (You know, everyone™s still looking for 
that film Œ still looking for it.) 
 

These two people, they had seen it.  And they de
scribed that  film to me, said it was the most 
horrifying thing because  the people lived for some
 time.  And it was really gruesome.  But it™s 
never been seen, huh?    

 

Q: (So who were the people who described Œ ) 

 

It™s way down in Argentina, ma ybe, or some whe r e, that film. 

 

Q: (But not in Russia, huh?   You see a lot 
of speculation is that it got to Russia.) 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
21 
 
 
Yeah, but they neve
r found it there. 
 

Q: (No, and I think the Russians woul
d have exposed it 
if they had it.) 
 

Q: (So who told you about actually seeing the film? )  

 

I™m trying to think Œ I™m trying to reme mber.  Cu
rt von Molo told me  that he had not seen the 
film, but that some one had, that he knew had seen 
the film and told him about it.  But he himself 
had not actually worked on that film
.  In fact, that there wasn™t a
nything to edit.  Apparently they 
just photographed it. 

 

Q: (So when you had to choose ma terial for the 
Nazi Plan
, I assume  you were trying to show the 
defendants, in action, among other things.   How di
d you decide what to keep and what to throw 
out? )  

 

Well, it was awfully tough, because we had such 
an embarrassment of riches.  We had so God 

damn much material.  What I would do is more 
or less ma ke a list of what we had and then go 
down check it out with Jim Donovan.  And he woul
d say ‚Yes™ to that Œ 
specifically, 
things like 
the self-incrimi nating stat ements, like, like Goering, 
Goering  reading the racist laws. So he said 
Œ In fact, watching the film yesterday, for the or
dinary public, it™s a shame 
we can™t subtitle it, 
because Goering was sayi ng some thing about the 
Jews, like that we need to sweep Germany 
clean with a steel broom, things like that, that
 were incriminating, so ma ny things they were 
saying that were definitely in 
breach of international law.   
 

So it was just a question really of, of very diffi
cult selection and, and elimination. I had told Jim 
Donovan that we could run, I thought
 we could, at one point I coul
d see running all day from 9 to 
5, and we could run all day. 

 

And he said, well obviously, we can™t do that.  And we finally worked it down.  Jim Donovan 

suggested four hours.  And so we went back andreviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the 

indictme nt that our film would relate to, but it, th
e...  We  had four film ed
i t ors and they literally 
worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mea
n, they worked until two and three in the 

morning, and started again at 7, they just work
ed around the clock.  And that film unit had so 
damn much film Œ 

 

Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particular
ly I™m interested in Joe Zigman since he also 
worked on the other film.) 

 

We had three very good Hollywood film editors: 
Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and 
Bob We bb.  And then we had one Russian girl 
Œ I swear to God, I don™t 
reme mber how she got 
assigned to us.  She was very helpful. She was a 
very small Russian newsreel editor. I think her 
name  was (Shostopol) or some thing. 

 

And so the four of them would work around the cl
ock, looking at this f
ilm and then trying to 
follow a sort of a rough outline that I would ma ke. 
 Let™s see now, we start in 1930 and we show 
highlight s before Hitler comes in, and then, we
 sort of outline d it st ep by step, and then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
22 
 
 
some body tried to select the most effective visual
ly and verbally.  And thank God, of c ourse we 
had interpreters with us to translate for us, 
as my, my three years of German at Dartmouth 
College was being strained
 to the breaking point. 
 

Q: (And were they handling orig
inal films, or did you ma ke work copies?   How did they do 
that?) 

 

Let™s see, at first we just l
ooked at the original film, and 
then as we started ma king our 
selections, we would, then we would ma ke copies
 of the footage that 
they were selecting. 
 

Q: (And the bosses in Nuremberg Œ describe agai
n how, how they wanted 
to revi ew the film 
work.) 

 

Well, for one thing, they would say some thing, th
at they needed a photograph or some thing.  The 
next day, they™d be calling and saying, ﬁ Well, 
where is it?  Bring it dow
n.ﬂ  We  would try to 
explain, that first we have to se
lect, we have to edit it, we have to Œ they never understood it.  
They never understood.  And General Donovan was ve
ry impatient.  He had no patience with us 
at all, none at all.  Because he would promis
e things on a high level that couldn™t be fulfilled 
down where we were, and that was the trouble.  
And he would be embarrassed, ﬁWell, where is 
it? ﬂ   So that, uh–. 

 

Donovan finally pulled, he hims elf 
pulled out of the trial, as you 
know.  His, his nose was out of 
joint because he was jealous of Justice Jacks
on, and he didn™t want to pl ay second fiddle to 
Jackson, really and so, eventually
 he withdrew completely, but th
at didn™t stop us, but we were 
left in place without Donovan, to finish 
the work that we™d been asked to do. 

 
Q: (So when you were working that quickly, and 
you got a little more time  because the trial was 
postponed Œ) 
 

Thank God.  When they said September 15
th
 Œ we , we debated whether to go down and admit, I 
don™t think that there couldn™t be
 any photographic evidence.  Y
ou™ll have to Œ   Even though 
Jackson in his opening day rema rks me ntioned that, 
I think, it was historic, 
it was the first time  
ever that there would be Œ it was 
not only the fi rst international trial, but the fi rst trial I believe 

that ever used photographic, film
 photographic evidence that way.  
And we were almost ready to 
say we can™t do it.  And then word 
came , it™s been postponed until October 15
th
.  And then we 
had a month™s leave.  But as we got toward October 15
th
 we weren™t ready either. We  still had 
like a month™s work, even killing ourselves with the work. 

   

And then thank God came this second postponeme nt
 to November.  And that really saved us, 
because without that, there wouldn™t have been any 
Nazi Plan
 film in the courtroom. 
 

Q: (And when it was shown, I™m i magining Œ wa s it 
a film with tape join
s, or had you ma de a 
print fr om, from the assembled material?) 

 

Yes, we ‚d ma de a print of the condensed four 
hour version, yeah, yes, bu t as noted Ray Kellogg 
had to Œ he testified as to the authenticity of 
the film, that it was all German film and so forth, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
23 
 
 
and so forth, and that all we™d done is brought 
four hours in place of four hundred hours, that we 
could have done. 

 

Q: (Did you ever consider whether yo
u had too many Nazi Party rallies?) 
 

I was worried about that.  I was worried about the 
party rallies, but at the same  ti me , the party 
rallies included two valuable things.  One was what 
they actua lly sa id at  thos
e rallies, which as it 
moved on, became more and more inflammatory as 
they got more and more powerful, and as the 
western democracies surrendered to them, and so
 on. They became more a nd more aggressive.  
So there was that sense of, of growing confiden
ce in their aggression that you can™t trace.   
 

And also, there were people whose very presence
 indicted them.  People would say that we, like 
Speer was one, and Schacht was another  Œ and 
a number of people Œ a
nd Keitel and Jodl Œ but 
people who said they were just German official
s but not necessarily N
azi Party related. And 
showing them with their Nazi badges and things 
was, was very helpful in
 indicting them.  And, 
and Riefenstahl was helpful in
 identifying various people. 
 

Q: (Let™s talk about Leni Rief
enstahl.  We re going to change
 tape again, –so we won™t talk 
about Leni yet.) 

 

Q: (When you showed the 
Nazi Plan
 in the courtroom, you were there.  Were the defendants 
glad to see themselves up on the screen?) 

 

No, I really wouldn™t describe 
it that way. No, I don™t think they
 were overjoyed. I think they 
were worried.  They looked worried really.  
They looked very, they were very concerned.  
Goering is, is interesting.  Goering was by fa
r the smartest of all the people on trial.   
 

I reme mber the day at our hotel, when the captain 
psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited.  He™d 
been testing the IQs of 
the various defendants.  And he sai
d, ﬁMy God, that Goering he acts like 
a clown.  He™s a genius.ﬂ  He said, ﬁHis IQ we
nt through the roof, he™s so smart.ﬂ  That guy™s 
name  was Murphy, Captain Murphy, who strangely
 enough years later committed suicide also.  I 
don™t reme mber why. 

 

But Goering tended to take the whole trial very se
riously, as I mentioned last night.  He acted 
like, as a defendant was who feels that he has 
a chance of being found not
 guilty. I don™t know if 
he really thought so, but that™s 
the way he acted, and that was hi
s demeanor most of the time in 
the courtroom.  He woul d take notes, and he woul
d consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he 
took it very seriously.   

 

Some  just sat like, as if they were staring.  
Streicher had a funny look on his face.  And the two 
military people, Keitel of the Ar my and Adm. Jo
dl [sic] very clearly, ve
ry clearly were saying, 
were disassociating, their attitude
 was, we shouldn™t be here, and we have nothing to do with 
this.  And they would sort of turn away, and act
 rather haughty, like that. 
 They were all kind of 
different. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502

But it is true that the day of the 
Nazi Plan
 screening I was very, it was like three months of work, 
it was like your movie is about to open, and I was 
very keen to get there. I purposely got there as 
early, so early I think I was the fi rs
t one to walk in, and so I was ab
le to get a seat.  I sat at  the 
end of the Russian table, and that table Œ as I 
noticed again last night 
Œ was like maybe ten feet 
from the dock, and from that vantage point, I was ab
le to watch them. The y were almost as near 
as you are, as you are to me , just a little furthe
r, but I could watch them
 absolutely, all their 
faces, I just  going down the line, back and forth. 

 

Q: (In the dark?) 

 

Well, it was dark except for the light of
 the screen.  I could see them though. 
 

Q: (Did you feel proud of your work?)   

 

I guess so. 

 

Q: (Interruption) 

 

I was feeling awfully relieved th
at we had it in time, I think that was my main e motion. It was 
really touch and go, too.  I mean I would get 
calls twice a day, ﬁHowis it?  Is it ready?ﬂ 

 

It was also, I just couldn™t take it down and show
 it.  I had to take 
it down and screen it for 
Jackson™sstaff to ma ke sure it 
was all germane, and, and I was very
 worried about that too Œ that 
they mi ght say ﬁNo you can™tﬂ Œ and they were ve
ry haughty, I mean they, their attitude toward 

us was sort of, ﬁ Who ne eds them? ﬂ   I mean, ﬁThey™re
 just a pain in the ass,
 sort of a nuisance,ﬂ I 
felt, and we don™t really, they were such Œ 
not Donovan, but Ben Kapl
an and the others.  
 

Q: (OK, I think we™re out of here, right? )

Tape 3 of 3: 
 
Leni Riefenstahl.  

 

Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.  

 

[Sound problem Œ Boom mi ke was missing.] 

 

Well, the Œ of all the Nazi propaganda films th
at, many were made, by far the most, by far the 
most illustrious, or you mi ght say notorious, of th
e Germans was Leni Riefenstahl™s ma ster film 
of the Nazi party day Œ I think 
it was the seventh Œ called the 
Triumph of the Will
.  It was shot in 
a way that you could see obviously 
idolized and ma de heroes of 
the people, by shooting at a low 
angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leader s, a sens
e of really ex-, ex-, exalting them.  The film, 
which was about a three-hour, very long docume ntary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of 

work.  It was overwhelming.  The, the idea that Go
ebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that 
could be shown, it was not only for German consumption.  It was shown all over Europe. 

 

And I think that it definitely ma de a contribution 
to the capitulation of the western democracies, 
capitulating to Hitler, letting him ma ke one act of
 aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and 
the Sudetenland, and on and on they we
nt, one little step at a time . 
And the feeling was that, looking at that film, 
that it would ma ke the non-Germa n countries and 
their leaders say, ﬁHow can we possibly defeat
 that power? ﬂ   It was overwhelming, just 
overwhelming. 

 

I think it was General D
onovan who said that the 
Triumph of the Will
 was worth two 
Wehrmacht
 
divisions.  It was a powerful piece of propaganda. 
 
And so, it was, it didn™t take any genius to think th
at we ought to talk to Le ni Riefenstahl.  She 
not only ma de that one ma sterwork, but she ma de a number of s mall 
Parteitag
 films or reports. 
She was very closely tied in with the whole 
Nazi propaganda machine.
  And so it was obvious 
that we would want to, to speak with her and, 
and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg.   
 

And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they 

directed to me to some place in 
Strasbourg.  And I went there, a
nd then I went to Kitzbühl.  And 
one by one, I got closer and closer
 to finding out where she actually
 was living Œ sort of hiding in 
the open, in a way.  It wasn™t exactly hiding but 
she wasn™t advertising either, what her address 
was.  

 

And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carri
er and an army driver, I was able to go to her 
house and literally just knock on the door.  She wa
s living in a very nice 
place Œ it was a big, big, 
rustic Œ it looked like three stor
ies Œ a very, quite large Œ on a, 
overlooking a Bavarian lake. It 
was a very ni ce place. So that™s what I did. 
 I just knocked on the door and somebody c a me to 
the door. 

 

And I was in my Navy uniform, of course. A
nd I said, ﬁI would like to speak to Miss 
Riefenstahl.ﬂ  And they let me in.  It was a littl
e ma n, said he would call her.  So I sat down, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
26 
 
 
I waited.  It took a very long time for  her to come
.  I think it was almost half an hour, ma ybe.  
She took a very long time comi ng.  I think she was ma
king up.  After all, she was a mo vie star as 
well as a filmmaker Œ big star in Germany Œall 
these famous i ce movies that she made, and 
mountain movies.   
 

And she finally came, and I sat with her on a couc
h.  And she started right away working on me .  

She said, of course, ﬁI™m a film artist, and in
ternationally respected.ﬂ  And she gave a very 
positive rundown on herself.  And she said, 
ﬁI™m respected ever
ywhere in London, in 
Hollywood, and so forth, and I™m not a Nazi, I™m a 
pure film artist.ﬂ  That
 was her own party line 
and, boy, she stuck to it pretty we
ll, too. And, and when she told
 me  how well received she was 
in Hollywood, of course that was my home town. 
 She didn™t know that I came from Hollywood. 

She just saw a young, an American officer who wa
s trying to do her in. And she told me  that, 
after all, even in 1938 everyone 
in Hollywood received her as a pur
e filmma ker and fellow artist. 
And I didn™t tell her that I wa
s in Hollywood when she came.  Hal Roach was an extremely 
rightwing Œ the old come dy producer/director Ha l Ro
ach gave a party for her, a big reception 
party, and asked all the ma in pe
ople in Hollywood to come .  And all of the liberal people like 

Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy 
Parker and so ma ny, Fr eddy March Œ a whole 
bunch, there must have been twenty Œ they were 
each given a list of te
n people to phone and say, 
ﬁDon™t go.ﬂ  I had a list myself. 
 And the party was a fiasco.  On
ly about eight or ten people Œ 
just the extreme right wing people like Victor 
McLaglen, people like that Œ only the fascist 
mi nded people, of which there were unpleasantly 
some  in Hollywood.  It was a total fiasco.  
Basically, the party was a disaster for her.  But I 
didn™t tell her that.  I ju
st listened and listened. 
 

But as I said last night, I had this
 warrant for her in my pocket.  It was like burning a hole in my 
pocket.  I thought, I would ju
st let her talk a l
ittle longer, so I relaxed he
r.  I didn™t argue with her 
at all about what she thought she was. 
 
Finally I took the thing out and said, ﬁMiss Rief
enstahl, I™m sorry, but I have to take you to 
Nuremberg.ﬂ  And that™s when she screamed ﬁP
uppi, Puppi, they™re, he™s arresting me ,ﬂ she 
screamed.  ﬁHe™s arresting me .ﬂ   And he ran in. 
 I didn™t know at the time,
 he was a major in the 
Wehrmacht
.  And I told her, I tried to reassure her,
 I said, ﬁLook, you™re not being put on trial 
with Goering and von Ribbentrop, but we do need you 
as a material witness, and you™ll be held, 
you™ll be put up in one of the hotels, and held until the court releases you.ﬂ 

 

And so out we went.  We went in Œ I wish I ha
d a photo of that Œ because sitting outside  was a 

weapons carrier, like an open truck al
most.  It was just the three of us, and we drove from there, 
from Kitzbühl, all the wa y to Nuremberg.  She 
didn™t say anything on the way.  She was just 
silent.  She didn™t say anything.  She was ve
ry ticked off Œ very.  And I guess scared. 
 

Q: (Did she speak English?) 

 

Yes, she coul d speak English, I guess quite well.
  She spoke fairly well Œ accented, but fairly 
well.  I didn™t need an in
terpreter with her, no.   
 

Q: (How did you use her?) 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
27 
 
 
They would run film, we  ran the 
Triumph of the Will
 and the other film that she ma de, and we 
would ask her to, we would stop it and ask her 
who was that, and who was that, and identifying 
people.  Wh ere and when and who it was, really. 
 

Q: (Did she work with you both in
 Be rlin and in Nuremberg?)   

 

Only in Nuremberg. 

 

Q: (Only in Nuremberg?) 

 

I took her only to Nuremberg. 

 

Q: (So she wasn™t in Wannsee–) 

 

No, she was never in Wa nnsee with us, no, no, no. 

 

Q: (Do you reme mber what month it was, 
when in the course of the project? ) 
 

When I took her there?   I think it was quite soon 
before the trial actually
 started.  I think it was 
like a week before, in, in early November.  

 

Q: (Who wrote the intertitles for 
The Nazi Plan
?) 
 

Well, I think I did, with the pe
ople that we had.  We had this
 German prosecutor who had Œ I 
never quite understood how Œ he had defected in 
™41 and got to the States, I think probably 
through the efforts of the OSS he some how 
got to Switzerland on Germa n business or 
some thing, and then defected.  And he was a veryhelpful of course in defining for us what we 
were looking at. 

 

Q: (So he was anti-Hitler, and he live
d in the St ates and spoke English too?) 
 

Yes, yes he did. 

 

Q: (Intertitles grew out of yourlist, your script you were taki
ng back and forth for approval? ) 
 

Yes, I think it was, yeah.  We  didn™t take the ac
tual film.  We would ma
ke a note describing what 
it was and, and summing up what was being said, or being written. 

 

Q: (Tell us more about 
your brother™s role in 
The
 
Nazi Plan
.)  
 

Stuart, Stuart got, he locate
d Hans Hoffmann, and Hoffmann was the key still photographic - 
both cameraman and archivist in, in Germany. He 
was really Hitler™s photographer.  And as I 
me ntioned, he was the father in law of one of th
e ma jor war criminals.  Baldur von Schirach was 
the head of the youth mo veme nt.  And so Stuart
 with Hoffmann got access to, I guess, as much 
still photographs as I had film up 
in Berlin. He and the separate 
staff that he had went through 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
28 
 
 
thousands and thousands and thousands of photogr
aphs, doing much the same  thing that I did, 
showing them to Donovan as to their 
value as evidence at the trial.   
[Footnote:  This refers to Heinrich Hoffmann.]
 
 
Q: (And they were entered 
into evidence separately–) 
 

Yeah, that™s right.  They 
were entered separately 
 

Q: (Were you and Stuart together wh
en you went through OSS training? ) 
 

No, no we weren™t at all, because 
my training preceded Stuart™s, as I™d be en in for almost a year, 
I think, before Stuart was transferred to the Mari
ne Corps.  And I™m not sure that–see, I™m not 
sure that Stuart went through th
at, what you mi ght call spy school. 
 I don™t reme mber that he did. 
 

Q: (Were you in Wa shington together? ) 

 

Oh yes, it was at the south Ag
riculture Building.  Th
at™s where I me ntioned before.  It was 
treated like a ship.  It was referred to as a sh
ip.  And we would ﬁgo ashoreﬂ and all this nonsense. 
 

Q: (You know it™s right across the str
eet from the Holocaust Museum? ) 

 

I™ll be damned.  No, I didn™t know that.  That™s wh
ere we were every day.  That™s really ironic. 
 

Q: (Could you tell us a little more about the 
SS editors? Von Molo & Rothe Œ what were their 
sympathies? What were their attitudes to what the Nazis had done?) 

 
Well, Wa lter Rothe was, had been a Fox Moviet
one film editor, he was a newsreel editor. 
Curt von Molo had been a feature film, fil m editor.
 He told me  that he had worked with Fritz 
Lang and with some  of t he top German direct
ors, and he seemed very, he seemed quite 
intelligent. And the two of them, instead of be
ing two Nazi POWs that mi ght have managed 
sympathy for each ot her, the two of them couldn™t st
and each other.  They di
dn™t like each other.  
And each, both of them told me  Œ ﬁI was recruite
d into the SS fil m unit but I was, I didn™t want 
to do it, but I had to or else.ﬂ  
Each one said the same  thing, ﬁI 
was really anti Nazi.ﬂ  Each one 
said about the other guy: ﬁWalter Rothe really wa
s a Nazi. He was very sympathetic.ﬂ And Rothe 
said the same thing about von Molo.  He was anti
 Nazi but von Molo wa
s pro-SS and wanted to 
get in that SS fil m unit.  They both sa id that. 
 They had no use for each ot
her at all.  I really 
didn™t know which of them was right. 
 

Also, Curt von Molo told me  that all through th
e war, while he was working for the SS, that a 
Jewish film editor had been hiding 
in his attic, like in his house. 
 And I took that with a grain of 
salt, because it was a joke to us. But from the fi
rst crossing over into Germany, we didn™t meet a 
German who didn™t have a Jew in the attic. 
 How could ther e be six million Jews in the 
concentration camps, be cause they must have 
all been up in the attics.  Everybody we me t, 
almost without fail, woul d say, ﬁI was against Hitler 
and I save d a Jew in my attic.ﬂ  It got to be a 
joke with us.  And von Molo said the same  thing. 
 He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was 
very precarious because he did work on th
ese horrible SS films, at the same time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
29 
 
 
 
I guess I didn™t tell that last ni
ght.  One Sunday, we Œ we would 
tend to try to rest on Sunday.  
We were, everybody was really wiped out by this
 work.  One Sunday, I said to von Molo,  
ﬁLook, Curt, I™m really sick of hearing about these Je
ws in the attic, I™ve ha
d it up to here with it, 
and I™ve got to tell you I 
don™t believe it, and he said, ﬁWell,
 honestly, I™m telling you the truth.  
It was that fellow, a friend of mi ne, that
 I worked with in 
the studio, you know, UFA.ﬂ 
 

And I said, ﬁLook, it™s Sunday morning.  Let™s take 
the day off.  We™ll ta
ke a jeep, and you and I 
and a driver, we™ll just drive around the whole day 
in Berlin.ﬂ Because, th
at™s right, he said, 
ﬁSomeone told me that he survived and that he™s
 back. Some one said they 
saw him i n Berlin, just 
a few days ago, and thank God, apparently he™s aliv
e.ﬂ So I said, ﬁCurt, le
t™s take the day off. 
And we™re going to look for this Jew in the attic.ﬂ 
 And we did.  So we start out, and he noticed 
some  girl in Nuremberg, and we go there and 
we find her Œ it was incr
edible we could find 
anybody, with how they were living Œ 
the place was a total disaster 
Œ people were living in holes 
and doorways and Christ knows, anyway this 
first girl says, ﬁI 
heard that too.ﬂ   
 

And I (referenced? )  this person, 
we went to see him, it was 
amazing we™d find anybody but there 
was still, even with everything down, there wa
s a kind of ama z ing word of mouth.  People 

seemed to know where other people were.  And 
to cut this short Œ af
ter a few hours of going 
from one (street?) to another, and finally to
 his actual, we found his own girlfriend, who had 
survived the war.  She lived a
ll the way through the war in Ber
lin.  And she said, ﬁYes, he is, 
he™s definitely here.ﬂ  And she told us where sh
e thought he was. And we went there.  And here 
come s this little Jewish guy, he was 
still in his concentration camp stripe
s and still Œ he        out, 
and he sees Curt, he hugs Curt, and he says to me
, ﬁThis man saved my life.
  I actually lived in 
his attic.ﬂ   

 
And we fina lly found a real Jew in the attic.  An
d apparently Curt was te
lling the truth the whole 
time.  And from that time on, I became  very, now 
I believed, now I knew that Curt was for real 
and that he really, he told me  that Fritz Lang 
left, and he tried to l
eave, and got stopped, or 
some thing.  He wasn™t able to leave.  He was 
hoping to leave, too.  Now I believed him.  Now I 
thought that Walter Rothe was 
a Nazi rat.  But it really
 was an unbelievable story. 
 
Q: (Did Von Molo & Rothe ever ask you about be
ing Jewish?   Did they 
ever bring the subject 
up?) 

 

No, not that I reme mber Œ no, I don™t reme mber 
them ever, no, I don™t, I 
don™t think they did. 
 

Q: (Were there family members from your mothe
r™s side who were affected by the Holocaust? ) 
 

Well, not really directly, no.  My mo ther was born 
in Latvia, and she came to the St ates with her 

parents when she was very, very young, like a year old Œ a baby being held in her mother™s arms , 

and she had no me mory at all of Latvia, but th
at™s where she was born.  And my father, my 
father was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, a
nd his parents had come  from Lithuania.  But 
neither fami ly was German-Jewish 
or, or involved in the Holocaust. 
 

Q: (But you must have still felt a personal commitment to this history) 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
30 
 
 
 
Oh gosh, yes, oh God, yes. Oh absolutely, we thought
, after all, if we™d been here, Wa rsaw or 
anywhere Œ We™d be one of these 
poor wretches in the ovens, oh yes. 
 

One funny thing happened in Wa nns ee.  We  wer e  in this big ma nsion, really, in Wa nnsee.  And 

we just went in one day and said, ﬁWe™re stayi
ng here.ﬂ  And they, the 
woma n was very well-to-
do and she still had her servants and everybody liv
ing in the big house in Wannsee.  Out in the 
back of the little garden wher
e there was a freshly dug grave that
 we could see, and apparently 
that was her husband. We never rea
lly got clear on what the circumstances were, but they were 
obviously very well connected; they had done very
 nicely, until one day I got a bad cold, and I 
stayed in bed, I was in this big       bedroom 
with my sniffles.  And she and the staff were very 
concerned about me .  They were taking care of 
me, the poor thing.  And they were bringing me  
tea and chicken soup and all kinds of things.  And 
I thought to myself, ﬁIf th
is had been last year, 
they would have been killing me , and now they™re 
taking care of my cold.ﬂ  I never told them 

about the Jewishness or anythi
ng.  But it struck me  funny, the 
concern they showed for me . 
 

(Did you or your brother experien
ce any hostility from Ger mans in
 the initial encounters when 
you started looking for ma terials?) 

 

Not really.  The reaction I got wa
s more, asking people, there™d be
 kind of a sullen Œ some , they 
were worried. My impression was, Raye, that they
 were more defensive in being worried they 
mi ght be involved.  They were like Just
 like the Jew in the attic Œ the revers
e of that was no one          
to have heard of a concentration camp. 

 

I went to Dachau.  It must have
 been two miles outside of Dacha
u, and I got lost, and I asked the 
way to the Dachau concentration 
camp.  And this was two miles away.  They had never heard of 
it. They didn™t know what I was talking about.  Th
at was the attitude Œ mo
re than hostility, was, I 
would say, their most concern was saving their own skin. 

 

Q: (Tell us more about attending the 
Dachau Trial Œ how long were you there)? 
 

I was only there about a week or so.  In fact, it 
was so typical there.  The, the, the pa ttern of 
denial was amazing. The  commander™s name  was  Wo
lf, and I swear to God, he looked kind of 
Jewish and had the Jewish name  of
 Wolf.  And his defense was sort
 of like, it really was, his 
defense was sort of like Œ ﬁ Well, I tried to save 
as ma ny as I could.  Like I could have killed 35 
or 40 thousand a week but I only killed 17 thousand.ﬂ 
 It was like he saved 
the lives of all these 
people.  That  was, that  attitude
 went all the way down the line. 
 

There was one big stupid looking guard, and he 
was accused of ma ltreating the Jewish prisoners, 
and he actually said, he said, ﬁWell, this woma
n, you see,ﬂ he said, ﬁI was under orders, I had to 
kick her,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut I didn™t kick
 her nearly as hard as, I wa s tryi
ng to kick her as little asﬂ.. It 
was, all the way down the line that 
was the attitude Œ that they di
d it as little as possible to 
survive.  I loved that thin
g about the kicking.  They onl
y kicked her 
a little bit. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502

And, and Wolf was, Wo lf was hung.  I think he 
was the only one there, I think, that wa s hung.  
The others there got senten
ces, different, but depending on 
their importance, on their 
involvement.   
[Footnote: The Dachau Commande r on trial was named Weiss Œ Martin Gottfried.  A 
prosecution witness named Wolf demonstrated pu
nishment on the whipping block at Dachau.  

See USHMM photo #61085]  

 

[Footnote: 42 were charged; 40 stood trial.  A
ll 40 were found guilty; 
36 were sentenced to 
death by hanging.  Official name of
 the trial was U.S. vs. Martin Go
ttfried Weiss, 
et al. It began 
Nov. 15, 1945 and ran to December 13, 1945.]  
 
I was only there to see how the trial was run, so
rt of getting ready for Nuremberg, whi c h was of 
course on a much, much higher scale. 

 

Q: (Was Stuart with you at all in Nuremberg, or
 in Berlin?   Di d I ask you that already?)   
 

It was just a short time .  It seems to me Œ I w
onder if Sandra could confirm this Œ as far as I can 
reme mber, Stuart, I don™t think he was there on the,
 when we showed the film.  I think by that 

time Stuart Œ I™m quite sure had gone home.  I thi
nk he had finished his work.   I just reme mber 

him at the beginning. But I don™t reme mber wo
rking with Stuart 
all the way through. 
 

Q: (Take us a little farther al
ong into the Pare Lorentz documen
tary, and that project as it 
emerged.) 

 

I was living out on my farm.  And 
I got back from the war in, I th
ink it was February of ™46 was 
when I finally got released from the Navy.  And 
I got, I bought that farm out in Bucks County.  
And Pare Lorentz came out to see me.  Oddly 
enough, he was ma rried to the girl, Elizabeth 
Graham, that I had worked with as a co-writer 
for Selznick.  And I knew her very, very well, 
liked her.  And so he came  out to see me  to
 describe the film he was planning to ma ke on 
Nuremberg, and he thought that after my Nure mb
erg experience, I would 
be the logi cal one to 
write and work with him on the film. 

 

And I told him that I had been in the war for four years.  I had just gotten out and now I had a 

contract for a novel with Random 
House, and they were actually 
paying me so much a month as 
an advance, and I was living on that, and so I had 
to go back and get starte
d on my other career.  
 

He then tried again, some time afterwards.  I sa
w him in New York, and 
he again urged me  to 
write this, he was very set on doing 
it.  And at that point, we talked
 about Stuart.  St uart actually 
had done an excellent job in Nuremb erg. I mean on his  
      he was very able and very smart with 
it, and so it just seemed a logical, logical job fo
r St uart, which Pare then proceeded to work with 

Stu. 

 

Q: (Did you follow very closely the ma king of 
the project?  Were you in
 touch with Stuart 
much? ) 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
32 
 
 
Yeah.  I would not say very closel
y, no.  I, of course I was in 
touch with Stuart and would see 
Stuart from time to time in New York, and I thi
nk once or twice I went out and saw Pare with 
Stuart and just heard what they
 were doing. I forget if they as
ked me  anything, but they mi ght 
have.  But it was more like that, but it, I was 
not in constant touch, but I wa s very aware of 
Stuart™s work and aware of the troubles he was 
having, that Sandra explained last night in much 

more detail, but I was aware of all the back and fo
rth troubles with the, uh, with the group in, in 

Germany that were trying to
 stop the film and so forth. 
 

Q: (Do you reme mber at all hearing about this re
ma rkable film footage th
at Stuart uncovered of 
this killing?  

 

Well, I just reme mber hearing about it once Œ that
 they actually had finally found some thing that 
we had hoped to find.  We never really found anythi
ng that was related to the gas chambers.  We  
had hoped to.  And we™d been told there was such
 film, but we had never uncovered it, so I was 
fascinated by what Stuart di
d, yeah.  I wish we could have
 shown that at the trial. 
 

Q: (I™m sure you do.  Who told you that there was 
footage of the gas chambers?   Wa s this more 
from your SS editors?) 

 

Yes, yes, they said that it, 
it also had been photographed, yeah. 
 

(Did you ever come  across Wa lter Frentz, who 
had worked with Leni Riefenstahl as a 
cameraman on the Olympics film?) 

   

I reme mber his name but I don™t recall talki
ng to him.  I re me mber his name , I guess. 
 
Q: (Because he filmed some  of those things you put in 
The Nazi Plan
, you know.) 
 
No, I don™t reme mber talking to him 
directly, only hearing about him.  
 

Q:  (Is there anything you coul
d tell us about the li
nk between the fact th
at Stuart and Joe 
Zigman wor ked on both 
The Nazi Plan
 and the Nuremberg documentary?   Do you have any 
thoughts about that continuity between them? ) 

 

Well, only that, I think that Stuart, in getting ready to ma ke that film with Pare, that a very 

logical, the most logical film editor 
would have been some one who worked on 
The Nazi Plan
.  
And he was very friendly with Joe Zi gman. 
 And, I think Bob Parrish had gone back to 
Hollywood and was building his own career right afte
r he got out.  And so I think that Joe was 
the logical choice for, and an id
eal choice for Stuart.  I reme mber
 him very well too, Zigman.  He 
was an awfully good person.  Yeah. 

 

Q: (Pare Lorentz seems to re
me mber him very fondly, too.) 
 

Yes, he was awfully appealing.  When did Joe die?
  Do you know when?   Cause I lost touch with 
him.

Q: (I haven™t found out exactly.) 
 

Q: (SS editors Œ How did the ma in film editors use 
them?   Were they used as assistant editors?   
Cutting?) 

  

No, I don™t recall them, I don™t recal
l them.– The y were muc h more
 just advising as to what 
film was available.  I don™t th
ink that they, I don™t reme mber 
them ever actually working on a 
Moviola, editing the film.  

 

Q: (And Movieolas are what you used, right? ) 

 

That™s what they used then, oh yes, God, ye
s.  Hours and hours and hours at the Moviola 
 

Q: (Separate tracks for sound?) 

 

Yes, I think there were separate tracks, yeah. 

 

Q: (For your ma terial for 
The Nazi Plan
, if I understand correctly, you 
only used original tracks 
that were found with the films? ) 

 

Absolutely, that™s right.  That™s the only thi
ng we could do. We couldn™t 
use anything that was 
not the German original, and nothing else, beca
use they thought the defe nse attorneys would 
pounce on it.  And by the way, the de fense attorney
s took their jobs very seriously, because it 
was not like a routine, cu
t and dried.  They really, they were 
all excellent  German lawyers.  And 
they worked very diligently a
nd would ma ke, I mean their, th
ey argued very hard for their 
client s; they really did. 
 
Q: (Did you have a sense that ther
e wa s anxiety on the part of th
e prosecution, as to whether the 
film evidence would be accepted and va
lid in supporting the indictment?) 
 

Well, uh, only at the beginning Œ at
 the beginning, much more than
 later.  I would say that 
gradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the 

statements were to what they had on paper.  A
nd so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we 

went along, and that when they found that stateme nts
 and pictures really were incriminating, they 
felt that  it would bolster their case. 

 

I think it was quite surprising 
and very enterprising of Jus
tice Jackson, comi ng from the 
background that he did Œ after all,
 he wasn™t John Ford from Hollywood Œ that he was as, as, as 
open to the use of film, which was so innovative 
and had never been done, as he was.  He was 
really very sympathetic to its use,
 as long as, as long as we were 
diligent.  Ben Kaplan who™s this 
very nice guy that I still talk to on the Vineyar
d.  He was very, very tough, and he was rather 
snooty about it.  I mean, he was doing it because they
 told him, but his heart 
wasn™t really in it, I 
don™t think.  But he would put it to
 very tough legal tests as to wh
ether it was just mo vies or it 
really was, really was indi
ctable evidence, which was 
good, really. That was useful.

Q: (I believe that was the standa
rd. Vi sual images could be en
tered as long as they were 
pertinent, directly pertinent to the charge.) 
 

Exactly, exactly, exactly. 
 And that™s what he held us to.  Yeah. 
 

Q: (Well, that must have made your job really
 hard at the beginning, when they hadn™t decided 
yet what the indictme nt
s were going to be.) 
 

That™s very true.  At the begi
nning, the whole thing was so, so ne
bulous, that we almost had to 
try to read their mi nds as to what they would be
 looking for.  We had to decide Œ these non-legal 
mi nds of ours Œ what did seem to us indictable ev
idence.  Yeah, that™s right.  We  had pretty good 
Œ but I must say, looking back, that we had a pr
etty good sense of what was really verbal and 
visual crime.  We ha
d some  sense of it. 
 

 Q: (Do you know what was done with the original
 film elements when you were finished? ) 

 

Well, I was very nervous about that, 
because, for one thing, on the July 20
th
, all that film, I had 
some thing which, there was some  a r my colonel that 
was attached to us, and we found out that he 
had taken some  of that film and sold it to so
me  American company.  An
d I just hit the ceiling, 
because all this stuff was very valuable in a pr
ivate profit-ma king way.  It
 was all very hot film, 
you mi ght say.  I had nightma res about how people 
mi ght try to grab it a
nd steal it and, and, and 
sell it.  And this colonel 
in the army, I asked that, I talked to
 Ke llogg about him and asked that he 
be removed from us.  I talked to people about
 Œ you must not Œeverybody has to be absolutely, 
totally honest about this, and, and scrupulous abou
t it.   We must send 
all of it back to the 
National Archives, and nowhere else.  And that™s what
 I did.  I sent all of the film to the National 
Archives. 
 
Q: (So, you must have required secur
ity even for the cutting rooms? ) 
 

Well, we did.  Yes we did. Yes they did.  
Yes, we were concerned about that, yeah. 
 

Q:  (Did you every sleep
 during this period?) 

 

Sleep?   I don™t think any of us every slept very 
much.  I really don™t.  We  were very hopped up.  
We were so excited, and also driven.  The phone 
calls from Nuremberg were a nightmare.  When 
the phone rang from Nur e mberg, I would grit my
 teeth Œ I knew what was comi ng.  And we 
were, we lived really in, in f
ear that any mo me nt, they would 
say, ﬁPack it in, we™ll do without 
the film.ﬂ  We were very afraid that mi ght ha
ppen, and so we all went on, on very little sleep, 

very little sleep.  But we were all very nerved 
up, too, and hyper, and real
ly very into how much 
we were being challenged to do in a short time . 

 

Q: (There must have been a great deal of comr ade s hip.) 

 

There was, it was a very close unit.  Bob Pa
rrish who unfortunately 
passed away a couple of 
years ago, he  became one of my best friends.  He 
was a wonderful ma n.  He was more or less in 
charge of all the film editors.  And he was a love
ly ma n.  He was a sort of child star.  He was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
35 
 
 
great pet of John Ford.  Ford really loved Bob, a
nd really helped him afte r he passed fr om acting 
to get in on the ground floor of film e diting, he  helped
 him a lot.   And Ford Œ as nast y as I could 
find him Œ was always very beni
gn with Bob.  He really liked
 Bob.  And Bob was a charmi ng 
guy, as well as being very, very, very able
.  I think he won an Oscar later for 
Body and Soul
, 
editing.  And then later he b
ecame a film director, on his own. 
 
Q: (How do you look back on this fitting into your whole career and life
?  What does this short 
period mean to you in terms of what you did? ) 

 

Well, I think of myself a s  being ve
ry lucky, really, that I just happe
ned to be in the right place at 
the right time and that I was very lucky they c
hose me  for that job.  They could have picked 
some body else, I guess.  And I think 
that just now, looking back that long ago as some , just one 
chapter in my life.  In just  
a short time I™ve celebrated the 60
th
 anniversary of the Nuremberg 
Trial.  And quite recen
tly I celebrated the 40
th
 anniversary of the Wa tts Writers Workshop, that I 
got started when, on the day the curfew was lifted 
on the Watts riots, or the Uprising as they 
always calledit down there. 

 

I think I™ve been lucky that I™ve been able 
to be  at certai n places at the right times. 

 

Q: (We only have a couple more mi nutes–) 

 

Ok. 

 

Q: (Do you want to describe some  more a
bout the Wa tts Wor kshop?   That seems like a 
wonderful–) 

 
Well, I . . . . Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40
th
, and, and uh saw these 
me n who are now about 60 years old, who were really
 uh kids some  wer e  quite almo st wild kids 
who were running the streets and, uh, it was very, 
it was very moving for me  to, when I, I call on 
the phone to University of Californi
a at Northridge, and, and, the voi
ce I hear is this very deep, 
profound-sounding voice saying, this is
 Professor Scott, please le
ave a message, and I think of 
this Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nine
teen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and 
throwing Molotov cocktails and all this.  
 

When I went down there, I went down on the first 
day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it 
was pretty wild still there.  Some  buildings 
were still smoking and smoldering, and there were 

little fires in the different  open lots, and it was ve
ry, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea, 
sort of a wild idea, of starting a writer™s work
shop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it wa s kind of 
a settleme nt house called We stmi nster.  I just put
 a sign up on the bulletin 
board saying ﬁ Writer™s 
Workshop, anybody interested sign below.ﬂ  And I 
said I would be back every We dnesday.   
 

It took me  a long time, for about 2 ½ months 
nobody came. Nobody came.  I just sat there.   I 
just sat there, and I learned a lot ab
out Wa tts.  I read the local paper, 
The Sentinel
, I talked with 
the social workers.  I went down in the, in 
the pool hall, sat around th
ere, got kind of snubbed 
and glared at.  I learned a lot, and my wife Gera
ldine was sort of taunting me  about this, and she 
said, I™d come  back and she said, ﬁWell, wh
at happened? ﬂ I™d say, ﬁWell nobody showed up.ﬂ  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0502  
36 
 
 
And she™d say, ﬁHow long can you really, sort of a 
Don Quixote act, this is getting ridiculous, 
how ma ny times can you go to Wa tts and nobody show
s up? ﬂ  And I said ﬁWell, I think I™ll just 
wait till, I™ll give it from Augus
t until Thanksgiving.ﬂ  This is now into, maybe early October.  
And I said, ﬁIf nobody shows up by Thanksgivi
ng ok, I™ll, uh, I™llpack it in.ﬂ   
 
Finally, finally, the next time I went down, this
 one guy came .  And it was, it was Charles, uh, 
Taylor, and he came with a young some what, uh, some what deme nted, uh, young ma n, very 

disturbed. And, uh, and this Charles sat opposite me
 and the young ma n sat right up, right next to 
me  and just staring right at me .  It was a, uh, 
strange, just stared at me .  And, uh, anyway, I 
brought down Claude Brown™s book, 
Manchild in the Promised Land 
and this guy Charles said, 
ﬁ What is all this?  What are you up to?  What are 
you trying to do? ﬂ  He 
was rather, a little bit 
belligerent, challenging, and I 
said, ﬁThere™s no mystery to it
, I™m trying to start a writer™s 
workshop.ﬂ   

 

And I then read to him some excerpts from 
Manchild in a Troubled Land
, and it was a little bit 
about, about Claude at the age of about 10, and, u
h, there™s been a riot in, in, uh, in Harlem, and 
he™s too small to go to it but 
his big brother™s saying, ﬁBoy it wa
s great.  We got a, we got a 
televi sion set, and a radio and this and that,ﬂ and,
 um, little Claude says, he writes this, ﬁGee, that 
sounds like such fun.  When can we have anothe
r one, when can we have another riot? ﬂ   And 
when I read that out loud to him, his react
ion was amazing, he said, ﬁI di dn™t know you were 
allowed to write that in a book!ﬂ 
 He said, ﬁWould they arrest him for that? ﬂ   And I said, ﬁNot 
only not arrest him, this book is a ma jor bestselle
r.  He™s ma king a lot of money out of this 
book.ﬂ   

 

Well, he was just amazed.  And that was, that
 really opened the door,I think he went back, 
because next  the day, next We dnesday, two or three people showed up with him, I think, 
including Johnny Scott and a few other young poets.  I™
ll ma ke this short, but what they showed 
me  Œ I couldn™t believe.  Their work wa
s so goddamn good.  J ohnny Scott was a goddamn 
genius.  I read some  the other day, it™s so good, a
nd some  of the others were too.  And that was 
the beginning.   
 

I then went to
 Los Angeles
 ma gazine and told them about this, and I showed them the work, and 
so they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and, uh, 
Time
 Magazine picked up on it, did a big 
story Œ also running a page of Johnny Scott a
nd Jimmy Sherma n, Sa mmy Harris, all these young 
poets.   And for that to be in 
Time
 Magazine was a huge, huge thing.  And they were offered 
money.  Then it got bigger and bigger, and it™s 
still going.  We  have now, now we have in New 
York, and when I got to New York
 I started it there, and we 
now have the Frederick Douglass 
Creative Arts Center on, uh, on 96
th
 Street. And there we have a f
aculty of twenty, and it™s, it™s 
much more, much more structured now.   Now 
it™s a real writing school, and, uh, it™s going very 
strong. 

 

Q: (So you™re back to where you were born.) 

 

Pretty much, that™s right.  Yes, I am, i t ™s
 very close to where 
I was born, I know.    
 

Q: (Budd, this is such a privilege and I thank you so much.)
