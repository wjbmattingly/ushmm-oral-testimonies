W ebegin with this photograph of a very young Esther Starobin, born Esther 
Rosenfeld. Esther was born in Germ any towhere the arrow on this m ap of Europe

She was born in Adelsheim , a town northof Stuttgart,to where thearrow points.  
Esther was the young

On Novem ber
 
9and 10, 1938, a violentanti
-
Jewish Pogrom , known as Kristallnacht 
or Night of  the Broken Glass instigated by Nazi party off icials and Nazi Storm T roopers took 
place
. ThePogrom took place throughout parts of  Germ any, Czechoslovakia, and Austria.  In 
thephotographGermans passedby the shop window of  a Jewish
-
owned business that was 
destroyed during Kristallnacht.
 
 
Concerned about the safety of  theirf am ily, the Rosenf elds registered their children 
for a Kindertransport, the informal nam e of arescue effortthat brought thousands of ref ugee 

Jewish children toGreat Britainf rom  Nazi Germ any between1938and 1940.  Esther worethis 
tag attached to her clothing as she traveledf rom her hometown of Adelsheim, Germany, to 
T horpeto join herfoster fam ily, the Harrisons.

Estherand Fred have two da

Judy is an attorney, 
and daughter Debra 
founded the Handm ade Afghans Project to, quote, bring comf ortand warm th to our wounded

also were senttoother m ilitary installations including 
F

North Carolina, andBagram  Air Base in Afghanistan. T heir goal of m aking 10,000 af ghans 
was m et in2013,and,in f act, they exceededthat with 10,845 af ghans and this am azing 

project 
cam e to a close.  About 1

600 people nationwide were ultimately invol ved in making 
af ghansfor thiseffort. Esther was deeply involved with this project. 
 
 
Estherand Fred have two grandchildren.  John is in his sophom ore year of college
.  
And Drew is a high school junior.  Ouraudience today includesEsther's daughter, Debra, as

Esther,thank you so much for joining us today andf or your willin gness to be our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
.W e're glad to have you with us.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I'm  glad to be here.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You have so much to sharewith us. W e justhavea shorttime, so we'll just 
jum p right into itand get started.
 
 
You were ver y young when your parents sent you toEngland.  Andalthough you 
were too young tobeable to tell usf irsthandabout all that you went throughand what lifewas 
like in Germ anyf or your fam ily, perhaps wecouldbegin tothe extent that you can, give us a 
senseof  yourf am ily, your parents, your extendedf am ily, what thehometown was like and 
what their com munity was like in the years bef ore the war and certainly bef ore you weresent 
away. 
 
>> Esther Starobin: W ell, I have to tell you, ever ything I know I know because I have been told 

by m y siblings or because I've looked itup.  Ireally don't remem ber.
 
 
B u t , f irs t of a ll,  A de ls h eim  is  t h is  rea lly s m a ll p la c e .  I t  s t ill only has one traf f ic  ligh t .   
And I was therethis sum mer with oneof m y nieces. W etried tof indsouvenirs. T hey didn't 
have them
,  
so that gives you an idea how small this place is. 
 
 
My parents

there weref ive of us, as you know f rom the picture.  My f ather sold 
gr a i n
 
to  
f arm ers andoccasionally would negotiate a tradeof a cow or horseor something like 
that.  Hehad lostone leg in the FirstW orldW ar, som y m other helped him;
 
especially if  the 
weather was badbecause he hadtrouble manipulating the cart andgetting on that.

T here was a sm all Jewish community there. There was a synagogue
; a
bout 10, 12 
fam ilies. It was really a small com munity. W e had oneuncle who lived there,but m y uncle 
cam e tothis country in 1937, right bef oreI was born. So I didn't know him then.
 
 
My sister said they had a very happy childhood until the Nazis cam e.  They went to 
school. They visited fam ily.  T hey hadfam ily in the next little town. They went there,too. 
 
Inf act, I wentback in 1960 with m y sister
 
--
 
80, with m y sister.  She m et people shehad gone 
to  
school with. T hey would talk about som ebody haddied when they were in f irst grade
,  
so  
here they were talking away about what had 
the 
kid died of .
  
I don't speak German.  I took 
Germ an inhigh school, in college. Itdidn't stick too well.  I'm  not very good at languages.  And 
I really don't know Germ an.  My sister translated when wef irst went, and then she stopped.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was your extendedf am ily?
 

>> Esther Starobin:  Well, m y parents eachhad nine siblings. So itwas pretty large.  
Several 
of m y f ather's siblings had come to the United States. T wo had com e very early in the century.  
T henm y other two uncles had com e in the 30s.  My m other had onesister who had gone to 
England,about1934 Ithink. The rest of them were 
k
ille d  in  t
he Holocaust.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And clearly m any, m any cousins and uncles andaunts. 
 
 
W hat was theage range of  your siblings? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I'm  the youngest.  My oldest sister is 12 yearsolder thanI am . Theother 

three were in them iddle. W orking it out. Solom on's m other was the m iddleof  them iddle.  
Renee'sfather was next to me in age. And thenI hadoneother sister who was close tomy 
oldest sister in age.  So there was a big spread
 i
n our ages.

>> Bill Benson:  Kristallnacht, Novem ber
 
9,10, 1938, convinced many Germ an Jews, including 
your parents, that lif e under the Nazis had becom e intolerableand could get worse.  Do you 
know anything f rom  what you've learned about the im pactof  Kristallnachton yourf am ily?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I do. According to whatIf oundout, there was a man who lives in 
Adelsheim
; h
e'sdonea lotof  research on the Jewish f am ilies and whathappened
 d
uring the 
Holocaust. W henever I don't know anything
; 
in other words, when Bill asks m e a question, I 
send an e
-
m ailandf ind out the answer. 
 
 
He said what happened, people cam e
 
--
 
they cam ef rom  other towns. T hey traveled 
through Germ any.  And each town af ew people would join them . And inAdelsheim, they did 
break the Jewish shopwindo ws.  T hey dragged booksout of the synagogue. Butm y parents' 
house was off  them ain beaten path so nothing happened to them on Kristallnacht. 
 
 
My sisters were in Aachen by then. T hey couldn't go to school.  Jewish kids were 
notallowed in the public schools.  So m y three older
 sist e
rs had been sent to Manheimto l
iv e  
with an aunt. I guess that school closed.  Sothey were in Aachen. Unlike today there wasn't 

instant news, so they had startedto walk to school thenext day andsaw the synagogue 
burning.  Somebody said, you know, go home.  Go back. So they never saw m y parents 
again. T hey were li vin g in Aachen at the tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I im agine at least Bertle remem bersthat.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  She does remember it.

a lotof  informationontelevision andthe stories about the Holocaust, my sister Bertle said, 
" O
h, I have some letters that my mother hadwritten when she was in cam ps."   Somy husband 
worked f ora law f irm where somebody knew Germ an. They translated them . Sobasically 

what I know aboutm y m other,a littlebit about m yf ather because he basically wrote two lines 
on each letter, is whatI've learnedf rom these letters, whatm y m other was like.
 
 
My parents had been living in Adelsheim af ter I went toEngland in 1939.  My m other 
had written these letters f rom  
G u rs ,  c amp
 
in France,becausethey were deported inOctober of  
1940
, m
y parentsandm y brother Herm an. W edon't know why th ey didn't send Herman on 
the Kindertransport.  They didn't. So they we re in France.
 
 
T hef irst couple of  letters m y m other was ver y optim istic that she was going to get 
out. But she wrote like all m others
,  yo
u know, m ake sure you listen to the people you're livi ng 
wi t h
, t
hank them
, w
ash behind your ears, study well in school; all thethings that any m other 
would write.  But then the letters changed.  She would say tom y sister Bertle, " Save your
 
clothes.  I've lost so much weight.  I can use the clothes."   Ortalking about how hard it was.
 
T he toneof  the letterschanged.  
 
 
I mean
, 
there are only f ive letters so I'm  reading a lot into these letters.  Butat the 
beginning it was a very optim istic
:  W
e're going to beable to come and join you in Englandand 
we'll all be together. And then it was m oretom y sister who was in the very old
 
--
 
she was a 
teenager
:  
m ake sure you keepeverybody together, stay together.  You know, you stay a 
f a m ily.   T a l
king about life being hard.
 
 
She certainly talkeda little bitabout what it was like.  Shetalked about Herm an,

Renee'sfather, butnot bitter inthe way that Ithink I wouldbebitter if I was there.T hen again, 
the letters m ight have been
 
--
 
>> B ill B e
nson:  Censored?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I would think.
 
>> Bill Benson: W emay come back to that,andI hope we will.
  
At Kristallnacht in 1939
,  
your 
parents made the extraordinary decision to sendtheir daughters away to England aspartof  
the Kindertransport.  Tell us what the Kindertransport was
 a
ndthen to the extent that you know 
anything about thearrangementsthat were m adefor you or your sisters to go by 

Kindertransport.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  In Englandthe 
Quaker
s,basically, went to 
Parliam ent
 
and t
ried to get 
Parliam ent to agreeto accept childrenf rom  Germ any to save them . T here were some 
stipulations.  W e
 
weren't supposed to stay in England. You had to pay so m uch in Germany.  I 
think it was 50
 
--
 
whatever was the equivalentof
 
$50 I think.  Idon't really know that.  And 
there,of  course, were hundredsof  people trying to get their kids out.
 
 
It passed 
Parliament
.   T he  
Quaker
sfound hostilesf or people to live in England.  My 
Aunt Hannah was in England. She worked as a domestic because it was the only thing she 
c
oulddo as an imm igrant. So m y three sisters went f rom  Aachen
 a
nd she found places for 
them f rom  people thatshe knew f rom  her wor k. T hey each went to three different places.
 
>> Bill Benson:  A couple of questions before we get to that.  Ultim ately, do you know how 
m any kids were savedby the Kindertransport? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  10,000.

>> Bill Benson:  It wascapped at that. W asn't it?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right. T he war broke out.  10,000.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And only reall y f rom  Germ any and Austria.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  And Czechoslovakia.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Czechoslovakia.  And your three sisters went separately f rom  you and 
ahead of you a little bit.  W as thatbecause
 
--
 
s o m et h i n g t o d o 
wit h
 
that they were in Aachen?
 
>> E s t h e r  S
tarobin:  Right. W e weren't in thesam e place. They really never talked abouttheir 
actualtrip.  My sister, Edy, who loved to eat,rem em bers when they crossed theborder into 
Holland getting chocolate and orange.  My other sisters never talked about it,
 
s o I  do n ' t  kno w
 
what they rem em bered about it.  And I was 2 years old.  Clearly somebody lookedaf term e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som ekind of chaperon or som ebody was with you.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Ihave no idea.  Asm uch as I've tried tof indthat out, I have
n't found that 

out. But I wentf rom Germ any to London. And then I was m etby awom an, Mrs.
 
Edmunds.  
And she tookmef rom London to wherem y Fosterf am ily lived outside Norridge.  I had a copy 

f rom my
 
--
 
a copy of  a letter, couldthey pickm eup.W e lived out in the country then. I did 
m eet her one of the tim es that I was in England.  But the 
Quaker
swere very in vol ved in this 
because,as now, they were against war.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywould make the arrangem ents tof ind different places.  So you were
 

beginning to tell us you had Aunt Hannah living in England, working as adomestic. So she 
was sort of instrum ental in you getting posted.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I think so.  My sister, Bertle, lived with af am ily i n London. And thenthey 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
m oved to Scotland. And she went to school in Scotlandf ora little bit.  Andaf ter the war she 
found out that the man she was living with wa s actually a spy f or theGerm ans. W henthey 
were in Scotland, he had been plane spotting or doing whatever
 
but apparently not for t
he  
English butfor the Germ ans.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So anam azing cover as a spy, he's taken ina refugee Jewish child inhis 
home andhe's spying for the Germ ans.
 
>> Esther Starobin: W hen she was 16, she lef t and hadto go to work.  She lived with m y aunt. 
 
Andm y aunt was rather temperam ental. If  Bertle got mad,m y auntwould take her ration book 
so she couldn't leave.  She lived inLondon.
 
 
My sist e r
,  
Ed
y
, li ved originall y with a f am ily in London.  And then asthe war 
progressed, people were sentout of London. And she lived with afam ily out inthe country.  
Shefelt they treated her like a slave. Shedidn't go to school after she was 14.  She worked 
ver y hard.  And then ultim ately she joined theBritish Arm y.  She was in the Arm y.
 
 
My sist e r
,  
Ruth, Solomon's grandm other, lived with a doctor inLondon. And then 
she was sent toa hostile.  And I think som eplace else she lived with  anotherfam ily.  And she 
also was not going to schoolanym ore. But then when we cam ehere in 47, she went to high 
school and
 
ultimately to college.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou use the word hostile, what was that? W ethink of hostilesf or 

people thatare traveling on the cheap in thiscountry, go
 
--
 
they can keep their suitcase and 
stay in a San Francisco 
--
 
wherever it is. W hat
 
was that like?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I think it was a way of  taking care of  childrenon the cheap, too. Of ten 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

they were sum mer cam ps that were usedfor this. So they weren't really warm in the winter.  
But they lived there. They went to school and did whatever.  
R u th
,  
to me, never talkedabout it 
m uch.  Her children said that she talkedabout it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we return to your experience inEngland, let's go back to what you 
were telling us about with your m otherand yourf ather.
  
Do you know at all wh y Herm an stayed 
with them and why Her m an didn't com e with you? Have you learned anything? 
 
>>
 
[Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:  For those who couldn'thear, thefam ily 
thought
 
is possibly because he was 
th e
 
only son and withfour sisters
 
the parents d
idn't want to let the son go, possibly, until later.  
T here's also som e thought that there was difficulty getting him  as a boy, to get to a transport, 

to actually get outof  Germ any.
 
 
T hem any, many, many tim es you've thoughtabout thatdecision that your 
parents 
m ade, I imaginef oreverybody in this room  trying to im agine thatmom ent when you say we 
have to send them away
,  
m ust have been extraordinary.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I can't im agine. There isa movie about the Kindertransport.  And in that 

m ovie there's som eone who talks about how angry she's alwa ys been at her parentsfor 
sending her away.  And herparents were killed inthe war.  I think, to me, it showed such love.  
I can't beangry about it.  Ithink it showed love.
 
 
And certainly when m y kids were thatage, I couldn't im agine. W hen m y grandsons 
were that age,I couldn't imagine it.  But youm ake sacrif icesfor your kids.  But I think it was 
quite a sacrif ice.  Even if  they didthinkthey were going to getout, there musthave been 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

13
 
som ething in t
he back of  the m ind thinking maybe I'm  not going to get out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely. 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I just think it's absolutely amazing.  Many of the people went on the 
Kindertransportnever saw their parents again. W e weren'tunusual about t
hat. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, Hermandid eventually get out. W hat do you know about 

Herm an'sability to leave Germ any?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Herman, whenm y parents were sent to Francein 1940, October
 
1940, he 
went with them .T heywere in two cam ps, Gurs and 
Rive s a lt e s
. 
>> Bill Benson:  He was with them .
 
>> Esther Starobin:  He was with them  in thecam ps.  It was kind of interesting. In the stuffyou 
can getonlinenow, you canf ind out lotsof  things. W henhe came to 
t h is  
country
, 
 
it said he 
could read French and German. And Ialways wondered where didhe learn to read.  In 1940 

he was 7. 7, I think.  Did they have schools in the camps? How 
did 
he learn all of these 
things?  Andhe wouldnever talk about it.
 
 
But the UnitedStates took in1,000 children in 1941.  And Herm ancam e to this 
country.  And he landed in New York.  He said
 
--
 
he knew he haduncles.  He didn'texactly 
know where they were.   But m y uncles
 
--
 
there's a Germ an Jewish newspaper. T hey saw t he 
list of  children. And som ebody picked him up.  And he lived with anaunt and uncle.
 
>> B
ill Benson:  So hewas one of
 
a group of 1,000 kids who were able to com eover to the 
United States.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right.  My aunt anduncle brought him up.  Infact, he considered them  hi

parents, his children,until one of the cousins told him  otherwise.  They were really their 
grandparents.  He was ver y close. T hey hadoneother son.  Andthey were a f amily.
 
 
It's pretty am azing.  I didn't rem em ber Herm an atall. W hen we came tothis 
country 
andI had this other brother,I hadbrother num bertwo. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told us a little bit aboutthe letters that you hadf rom yourm other. So it 
was not until the 1980
s 
that you even have the opportunity to read those letters?
 
>> E s t h e r  S
tarobin:  Right. W hen we f irst cam eto this country, I sort of  thought, well, m aybe 
m y parents would show up.  But Bertle knew they were dead.  Idon't know when I actually 
knew.  T here were lists and that. She knew. 
  
W enever talked about it.  
 
 
My best f riendall through high schooland junior high, I wrote som ething f or this 
m em oir writing thing about being on theKindertransport
 a
nd I sent it toher. And she saidall 
the years she never knew that.  I wrote that whenI was in m y 60sand I had known her since I 

was about 13. 
 
Ididn'tactually know the name of how I knew I had thisf am ily and I knew I 
went on the train and thenI cam ehere.  But it's like separate partsof m y life that weren't 

connected Exactly.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course, eventually, you would learn that thedate,August
 
14, would have 
particular signif icance.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right. T hat was theday m y parents were transport
e d 
to Auschwit z and 
m urdered there.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid youf ind that out? 
 
>> Esther Starobin: There's a French book that listsall the people that were in the camps,

where they were f rom
 
andhow old they were , when they were transported and thenum ber of  
the transported.  I would say 15,20 years. I think I knew it thef irsttim eI didthis. It wasf
a ir l y  
recently when you're as old as I am .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yes. That is recent.
 
 
W hat do you know about the cam ps they wer e sent to before they went to 
A u sch wit z?  
>> Esther Starobin: They were work cam ps. Oneof m y aunts was also there because inone 
o
f  the lettersm y m other m entionsthat
 A
untTony was working in the kitchen and she couldget 
extra f oodfor Herm anwho was al wa ys hungry, because they didn'tget enough f ood. 
 
 
Actually, when hef irst cam e here,m y aunttold Bertle, when we came, that Herm
an  
usedtohidefood all over the housebecause he was hungry
, w
hich m akes sense
; h
e was a 
gro wing boy.  He hada hellof  a time, actually. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would live with the Harrisonfam ily as
 
your Fosterf am ily in England 
f ro m  
the tim e you were age2 until 10.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So until 1947, the eightof  the f irst10 years of your life. Tell us about the 
Harrisons and your life with them and thenalso having sisters in other parts of  Englandand 
oneeven in Scotland.
 
>>
 
Esther Starobin:  Ok.  W ell, the Harrisonswere very de vout,f undam entalist Christians.  
And Uncle Harry
 
--
 
I called them Auntie Dot and Uncle Harry, worked in a shoefactory owned 
by a Jewish m an.  Heputa sign
 
was anybody wil ling to take a child.  Sothat's how I got tobe

with them .T hey hadwanted aboy because they had one son,Allen, who's 
seven
 
years older 
than I am .  But I cameto live with them .
 
 
W hen I f i r s t go t  t her e ,  I h a d 
S
carlet 
F
ever.  So I was stuck in a bedroom .  Allen used 
to play with m e through the window.  But I was very m uch af raid
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you were quarantined.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I was quarantined. 
 
[ La ugh t e r ]
  
 
 
So I was very m uch af raid of Uncle Harry who  was ver y sof t
-
spoken. In all the years 
I knew him ,henever raisedhis voice
, b
ut I was petrif ied of him
 w
hich I thinkm usthave been 
because I had heard loud voices. T herem ust have been some connectionbetween whathad 
happened.  
 
 
But Allen was so goodto me. I think about it. He was 9 and I was 2.  And
 
I came 
andtook over their family, kind of.  Andhedidn't try to do me inor anything.  He used totake 

m earound with him. He m ade sure I got toschool. He was a terrific big brother.
 
 
T hey belonged toafundamentalist chapel.  Mr.
 
Ram sey, who owned the chapel, 
hadhelped them  get som e of the things they needed.  Back then, when you were 2, you were 
s t ill a  b ab y
;  
so they helpedthem  get some of the things they needed
b
ecause the Harrisons 
really didn't have a lotof m oney.  And we we nt to the chapelth
e r e.
 
 
Inm any religions now the big thing is comm unity, having com m unity. W ell, this 
chapel had comm unity.  It had a lot of activities.  I went to chapel with them.  Idon't know if 

they tried to convertme.  Idon't think sobut I didn't know m uch about being Jewish either.
 
Mr.
 
Ram sey knew Hebrew.  He was supposed toteachm e whenI got older
,  
but Iam  really

bad at languages
; 
Ididn't learn Hebrew.
 
 
T here was a strong union.  Soaf terthe war there were tripsf rom the factory to the 
seaside.  I would goon that.  I loved school in England. I was just atthepoint
 
--
 
they had an 
exam  that you hadto take, the11
-
plus to goon to higher education.  I was just at the pointto 
take that when we came here.
  
According toAllen, he saidI was ver y competitive and liked to 
get good grades.  But I don't remem ber that
.  H
e's m aking it up.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
I don't know.
 
 
I really had a pretty happy childhood there.  And I guess I knew I wasn't going to be 
there forever
, b
ut I never asked questions.  I'm  not too good at 
questioning 
wherever I am , 
whatever is happening.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Generally, it was a happy childhood.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Itwas ver y happy.  Ihad a gas mask thatI hadto carry around with me.  
W ehad to get it checked.  There were bombs. W e hada bomb shelter we went into. That 
was the way it was.
  
My sisters cam e to visit periodically.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Eachof them were able to do that?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  I think it was mostly af terthe war that they came. My Aunt Hannah 
cam e once, but th
erewas a certain tension between Auntie Dot and Aunt Hannah.  I thinkthey 
didn't gel too well.
 
 
On e  tim e
 
--
 
m y Aunt Hannah was very kosher.  It was hardto getfood during the 
war.  And one tim eBertle got a chicken, but she couldn't get it killedbecause ithad tobe killed

kosher. She took the chickenback on the train in a box.
 
 
Andone time we went to Londonto visit.  I rem em ber Allenand I going up and down 
theescalators I guess in Harrah's orone of those stores because 
N
orridge didn't have such 
things.  It was abig excitem ent to do that.  But the Harrisonsalways welcomedm y sisters.  I 
knew Aunt Hannah,but I didn't know any of the other people thatm y sisters lived with.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you had explained a littlewhile ago, oneof  yoursisters, at leastone of  

th em , d id
 
not have a particularly happy foster situation.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatabout theother sisters?  
E d i th
 
joinedthe British Arm y.
 
>> Esther Starobin: To escape where she was.  And Ruth,I never talke
d about it much with 

Ruth. I don't know wh ether she thought of itas terrible or
 
--
 
Idon'tknow.  If T am ar were here, 
she would know. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  You told m e one tim eaboutEdithhad an experience asa memberof  the 
British Arm y returning to Adelsh
e im .
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  She went back to Germany af ter the war.  She was walking down 

the street in Germ any. Som ebody came up to herand said, " Adolph's daughter."  She knew 
exactly who she was.  She looks,according to the picture, she looked a 
lo t like my fa the r. It's 
a small place. 
 
 
Inf act, when we wentback
 
--
 
when Bertle and I went in 2000,people cam eupand 
talkedabouthelpingmy parents because they didn't get ration coupons and it was hardfor 
them  to getf ood.  Andone m an talkedabo

their doorstep.  He said his wif e was very upset because if  they had gotten caught, it would not 
have been goodf ortheir fam ily.
  
I sa id  to B e rtle , " D
o you think that's true?"
 
>> Bill Benson:  It would be easy to say.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  After the war.  She said yeah. T here had beenother letters,and m y 
m other m entioned it.
 
 
Another persontalked aboutm y parents would exchange something that was in the 
hou
se.  Again, I said to Bertle," D
o you 
th in k  it
's true?"  
 
An
d she saidyeah.  
 
 
But I go backto whenm y parents were sent
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.
 
>> Esther Starobin: They were sent in 1940, as I said. W hen we wentback to Adelsheim , 

Re in
h
art gave usa copy of the ordertelling us they had to
 
va c a
te
 
within an hour or so
.   Th
e  lis t  
that was inm y house, it was so detailed iteven listedthe rags in thehouse.  Unbelievable the 

details.  
 
 
T he house was sold supposedly to pay adebt.
  
W ell, in 1936, som eone had sued 
m y f ather saying that he had 
cheated them  on
 
--
 
som ething todo with ahorse. But it was the 
beginning of  whentheNazis were taking thebusinesses away f rom the Jews.  It wasn't 
particularly true, but itgot thebusiness away.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they used a legal pretense to get hi
s bu sin e ss.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you had a com plete inventory of everything in the household.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Absolutely am azing.

T he other interesting thing about this inventory, Bertle said they had a very f ancy doll 
in  o
ne of the room s that they weren't allowed to touch. But that dollwasn't on the inventory.  
So som ebody had taken the doll.
 
 
W hen we went back, we walked by thehouse. W edidn't go in,but Iwent back
 
--
 
I 
hadbeen back bef ore then.  But Reinhart arrangedf orus to go in the house. It's beautif ul. It 
hadbeen rem odeled and this and that.  But the thing that really got m e
 
--
 
m y grandsons were 
about 8, 9.  Iforget how old.  Butupstairs wh ere the son lived, exact same thatm y grandsons 

had but neat.  Eve
rythi ng was in its place. Very Germ an.  Not 
t he  
way m y grandsons were.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hich was ver y Am erican. 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  I was there with Renee's sister this sum mer. There's a program  in 
Germ any to put stepping stones inf ront of houses that were ownedby Jews.  And the people 
who are living there have to agree to it. And thesepeople won'tagree to it. 
 
>> [Inaudible]
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Could be. Yeah.W henwe went
 
--
 
If orgot Renee was with us.  She 
went, too. 
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
In 1947, two years af ter thewar has ended, your sister Bertle, your oldest 
sister, arranges for 
you and your other sisters, except Edith who's in the Arm y, to leave 
Englandand com e to the United States. W ill 
you 
tell us what you know aboutthe decision
 
to  
do that, the arrangem ents, and what it was lik ef or you to leave theHarrisons af tereigh
t 

years?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  W ell, m y motherhadtoldus we were all supposed to stay together

and come to the United States. T here was som ething called Bloomsbury H
ouse.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas something she told Bertle?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  In the letters.
 
>> Bill Benson: T akeever ybody when you can to the United States?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  So Bloom sbury
 
has help with getting peopleon to ships.  So 
B
ertle got a 
call one day that we could leave the next day.  The Harrisons didnot have aphone. Bertle 

called the police in Norridge, andthey cam e to the door of the Harrisons andtoldthe Harrisons 
they had totake me toLondonthe next day because I was leaving. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W as that thef irstthey knew that?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  They knew
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T heyknew eventually it was going to happen.
 
>> Esther Starobin: W henever there was room  on the ship.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  So Uncle Harry, of  course, couldn't leave work.  Allen was supposed to 

get a big prize at school the next day, butheskips that.  AndAuntieDot and they tookm e to 
Londonand handedme over like a package. I was ver y m uch a package in 
a ll of this stuff. 
W e wen t  to  S
outh 
Ha
m
pton to leave. W e were on the Queen Mary, which hadbeen used asa 
troop ship. And then it was f or this.
 
 
T here was a strike. Apparently, which I didn't know at the time,but som e
b od y f r om

the royalf am ily was on the ship. Sothis was a goodtim e to strike. But my aunt had given m y 
sist e
r bread.  AndBertle had a boyfriend whowas a
 
butcher, so we had sausage,food to eat.  
Andeventually we took off.
 
 
W ell, I was so sea
sick a n d  
som iserable.  Ididn't want to leave. I wanted to stay 
where I was.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ithad to be very painfulf or you.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Itwas awf ul.  Allentellsm ehis mother's hair turnedW hite overnight then.  

H
e hadn'thad white hair.  So I gue
ss it  wa s a sh o ck to  t he m.   
T hey knew I had to leave, too.  
But I had been theref or a long time. I was very m uch apart of theirfam ily.  They were m y 

f a m ily.
 
 
So we came to the United States. T wo uncles m et us in New York.  Bertle knew one 
of  t he  un c l e
s. Theother was a m arried in Am erican uncle. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  One of  your relatives had left Germany in the m id 1930s.  So it was partof 

th a t fam ily.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  So we lived with an aunt and uncle when we f irst came. T hey had 
a big hou
se .   I
f  you'rea localperson, North C
apital 
S
treet has thesebig houses. W e hadone 
room . T here was another refugeef am ily in another room .  My aunt, m y uncle,my aunt's 

m other, two cousins. It was the worst experience I've had inm y lif e.
  
Most people
 
when they 
talk about the Kindertransport, they talk about going to England and livin g with f am ilies who 

didn't love them  and they had to work anddoall of  this stuff. W ell, Ihad a great tim e in 
England
 c
ompared to here. 
 
My uncle had abadtem per and threw furniturearound.  My aunt 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

23
 
was cra zy.  Nowadays they'd havem edicinefor her but they didn't then.
 
[Laughter]
 
It was bef ore the tim e that they hadf orpeople who were reall y m entally il l.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're 10 years old.  It was just a very diff icult transition.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I m ovedf rom  the country to the city.  I changed religions.  I changed 
schools. This schoolwas ver y different.  Ihad a really nasty teacher.  And it was just totally 
different. I had never been to am ovie. T heHarrisons didn't do movies.  They didn't listen to 
m usic. They didn't dance. They didn't wear m akeup.  Andas an adult, some of that was 
because they didn't have the money but Ididn't know that.
 
 
So we lived with m y aunt
 
anduncle.  I rem ember m y uncle 
d ra
gging m e out trying to 
m ake me go to them ovies.  I f inally went to see "TheW izardof  Oz" but I was here quitea 
while before Idid that.
 
 
It wa s m e an
 c
ompared to where Ihad been in a loving f am ily.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdo 
you 
r em em be r  
your education tr
ansition?  T
here you were in the 
English schools.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I didn't learn anything new f or quitea while
 o
ther than gramm ar. In 
England,they didn't em phasize gram m ar.  But Ididn't learnanything new.
 
 
T hen I went to junior high andhad am arvelous teacher in junior high. T hat was ok.
 
W hen m y s i s t er  
E d y 
got demarkedf rom theBritish Arm y and cam e over, once shehad a job, 
Bertle hada job, they got anapartm ent. Sohere w
e re
 
these two young wom en trying to m ake 
a new life in a new country.  And they had me, m y sister

Ruth, his mother, went to college.

NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
24
 
And in thosedays shecould work for room  and board andtuition.  She worked andpaidfor all 
of  it. So it was really different.
  
My sisters at tim es were dating people who were teaching in 
t
he schoolI went to. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  But you were living with your sisters at thatpoint.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  W em oved a lot,but we were living together.  My sisters arepretty 

unusual. They never said
 
--
 
I graduatedf rom high school whenI was
 
16 because I had gone 
to school inEngland.  W e were ahead. T hey never said tom e when you graduate you have to 

go to work.  They expect
ed m e 
to go to college.  
T ha t
 
would never have happened in 
Germ any.  It just wouldn't have. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter you left England in1947, were you able at thatpointto stay in touch with 
the Harrisons?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  My sisters m ade sure I did.  Idid. I wouldn't say I wrote a lot, but Idid 
write.  They wrote back.  So I did stay in touch with them . 
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  And you have continued a relationship with thefam ily e ver since.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I have. W hen m y daughters were little, we we nt over to visit.  I think it 
was 1964. And thenAllen got a Fulbright teaching
 
--
 
he taught here for a year. At 
the end of  
his year we brought his parents overf or the summ er. It was really interesting. They lived in 

this very quiet lif e.  No telephone. They didn't get a ref rigerator untilwe went over andthey got 
this little thing which they unplugged as soonas we left.  Andthey got on the airplaneand 
cam e here.  It was just
 
--
 
when I thinkabout it, it was gutsy f or them
; a
bout a 
month
 
or so here.  
Ever ybody visited
 
them . W e did a vacation in T o
m s River, New Jer sey which Allenfoundfor

25
 
u s.  It's the  mo squ i
to capitalof  the world.  Don't go there. 
 
 
It was really special to have the Harrisons here and to be able to repay them  a little 
b it
f
or what they had donefor m e. Auntie Dot died soon after that. Uncle Harry used to com e 
over in the summ erfor about six weeks.  He loved com ing over.  And he loved going to 
synagogue with us and to brotherhood. Andwhat Allenf ound out since his father died,his 
grandfather was Jewis h.  He wasf rom  the Ukraine. And he was Jewish
, w
hich is kind of  
interesting
;  wh ic h  k in
d of  explains.  M
aybe there was som ething in hisf ather's mem ory.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Allen still com es to this day.  Right? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  He does.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You still stay in touch.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Very m uch so.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You've mentioned, of course, that you went back to Adelsheim . T ell us a little 

m oreabout your tripsback to Adelsheim  and what that's likef or you to go back to the place 
where you lef t your parents.
 
>> Esther Starobin: The f irst tim eI went back was in the 
l at e  19 80
s
.  I needed tof indout that 
I 
didn't comef rom a black hole;
 
I cam ef rom  areal place.  And we went back.  Originally Bertle 
andher husband were going to go, but Morris got sick and couldn't go.  But Bertle had written 

to them because she still
 
rem em bers some Germ an.  
 
 
W egotthere. W e gotto Adelsheim . And there's noone, absolute
 
--
 
not a person 
anywhere.  So we went to where we thought the 
t
own 
h
all was.  And it wasn't.
 
--
 
it wasn't open.  
Apparently it closesfor lunch. T hen wef ound the
 
to
wn  
h
all. W henwe got there, there was no 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
26
 
one who spokeEnglish.  I don't speak German. W e got them tounderstand why we were 
there.T hey dug out the letter that Bertle hadsent.T hey said that the wif e of the assistant
 
Burger
m eister spoke English.  W earrangedto meet with them  the next day.  T hey said
:  y
ou 
don't wantto stay here overnight.  You want to go som ewhere
, 
someplace els
e . I sa id , ﬁNo , 
you're not sending m e away 
again
.  
I 'm  
staying
 
overnight.
ﬂ  
So we stayed overnight.  
 
 I  
don't know what we ate because it was all in German. Probably som ething I 
wouldn't have eaten if I had known what it was.
  
T hat night,I had such a nightm are.  I dream t 
that Nazis were com ing up the steps to getme.  It was really scar y.  
  
 
But thenext day we met the
 
people. There was am an called Mr.
 
W eterhan who 
had known m y parents
.  H
e ,  
at the tim e
,  
was them an keeping trackof  the Jews and what had 
happened.
  
W e went to the house.  He showed us where the synagogue had been. W e went 
to the Jewish cem etery which was between that town and thenext town.  I had a lot off am ily 

m em be r s  t h e r e.
  
T here's a museum , which is openedonSundays but they opened it, andwe 
sa w th a t.  
 
 
So I was glad to go there.  I was also gladto leave there.  But itdidn't mean anything 
to
 
m e. My sisters hadtold m e some
 
places to lookfor.  Ifound those places.  But I didn'tfeel a 
connection.  Ifelt like a tourist ina touristy place.  It didn'tm eanm uch tom e even thoughI 
knew this was where Ihad been bornand where m y sisters had grown up.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did Bertle go back toAdelsheim ?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  A few years later.  She really liked it.  She could reactto it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  12 years older than you were.  So she would have rem em beredmany things.

So they've been back. Quitea lot of us have actually been there. My kids haven't

If igured I wasn't going to like him.  He was German.  
Right?  Butthen he cam eto visit.  He's really a very charm i
ng m an.  But he taught at the local 
high school.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Adelsheim ? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  In Adelsheim .  He said, 
ﬁIt's yo u r tu rn . Y
ou take over.
ﬂ
  
He had an after 
school club. They did a lot of  research. Andjust as I wantedto know things 
about Germany, 

theother people who left Germ any had contactedhim . So he has kept track of most of the 
people
 
--
 
well, there weren't so many, but hehas contact.  Many peoplehave beenback.
 
W ediscovered a cousin, a cousinf ive tim es rem oved, whose grandfatherand our grandf ather 

I think were brothers. Peter. Lives in Ireland.  So we have contactwith him.  He wrote to 
Bertle and said I thinkI'm  your cousin and this kind of thing.

But Reinharthas really gotten involved.  He set up am useum  in what used to be the 
synagogue.  He knows a lotabout Judaism .He visits the synagogue.  Andthe Jewish tradition 
is to put a little stone on the grave if  you visit.  Andhedoes that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So he's sort of become the keeper of  thememories.

Andm y m other camefrom  Rexing

. T here's somebody there
 
--
 
Tam ar just got 
here. There's someone in Rexing
en
 
that I'vegotten some contact wi th. They have a cemetery 
where m any of m y m other's fam ily were buried.
  
I
t's really interesting. T hism an who's writt en 
a book about the Jewish cem etery, who all the people were totally cataloged, when hef inished 
that, the restof  the cem etery is crusaders. He was going to do a thing on the crusaders
 a
nd 
what different group
s of  people in that.
 
 
So Reinhart really cares a lot.  He's done thesef am ily trees
f
or eachof  the Jewish 
fam ilies. He probably knows m ore about ourfam ily than I do
, a
c t ua lly.  
  
W hen we went back in 
2000, they hada program  to m ark the comm em oration. No governmentm oney in it.  He had 
exhibits about eachofthe fam ilies, photocopies.  It wasn't slick, but it was ver y inf ormative, 
ver y com plete.  Andthey had a lovely progra m ,m ost of  which was in Germ an so I didn't 
understand it. But I've had it translated sincethen.  But there were police outside.T hey 
thought therem ight be skinheads there
, w
hich was a little unnerving. 
  
And there were a lot of  
people at the program .  W e went because we thought they shouldhave som e Jews there. So 

we were there. 
 
Ifound it ver y m oving.  T herewere various ages of people there.  
 
 
Don't you think?

>> Esther Starobin: W hat Renee said, that Reinhart saidhe was very com mitted to keeping 
the story of the Jews alive
 a
nd what happened tothem .  He is co
lle ct in g a ll of  th is  to write a 
book.
  
In the meantime, heand som eone else have collaborated ona book about the Jewish 
cem eteries. He is very comm itted. Inthe meantime,he'shad som e grandchildren, sohe's not 
qu ite  a s comm itted . 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have a little bitof  tim e,Esther to turn toour audience to ask
 
--
 
have them  
ask you afew questions ifthey wish.  Are you ready for that?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  As long as you repeat the question.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have a question right here. T ry to make it as brief as you can. W e have a 
m icrophone I think right here.  Just in case we don't hear it orpeople in the back don't hear it 
I'll try m y best to repeat the question.
 
>> T hank youf or sharing your story.  Have you been able tof orgive  thepeople
 w
ho did this to 
you and yourfam ily?
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question is,for
 
those who m ightnothave heard:  Have you been ableto 
forgi ve thepeople who did this to youand yourf am ily? 
 

>> Esther Starobin:  Itdoesn't helpm e to beangry at them .  I think
 
there were som e very evil 
people. Am I still angry?  No.  
A
m  Ihurt?  Yes. T hey're two different things.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you, Esther.
 
 
W e're going to bring the m icdown
 
to
 
you right herebehind you.  The people in the 
backm ight not. So that helps. T here we go.

>> You said your father lost his leg during the FirstW orldW ar.  
Did h e
 
serve in the German 
A r m y?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your father serve in the Germ an Arm y in the FirstW orld War?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  He did.  Hehad been training to be abaker.  Of coursehe couldn't dothat 
because bakershave to standupa lotand he couldn't do thatanymore.  Hehad am edalof  
som e sort which he thought would help him . But, of  course, it didn't. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do we have any other questions?W hile som em ay be thinking of another 
question,I was going to ask. You've learnedm ore recently or at som epoint that there were 
otherKindertransport children Ithink in the sam etown of  Norridge.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yes.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Did you know any of  that when you were young?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Ididn't know any of  that.  Apparently there were about 200 in that general 
area,butpartof not knowing was probably becausethe Harrisons weren't Jewish so they 
weren't connected into the Jewish comm unity.  And Idon't know if  there was any eff orttohelp 
people to know other kinder in thearea.  But there's an organizationnow, Kindertransport 
organization.  And one of  them en who was 
p
residentof  itatone point was f rom  Norridge.  So 
at som epoint Allen said, well, m aybe we couldf ind who he lived with.  I said we'll look in the 

phone book.  So we did visit her. T hey alsohada very close relationship.  I kept up the 
relationship over the years.  I don't know how true that is 
f or m ost 
K
inder becausea lotof  them 
were pretty bitter about who they lived with.

>> Bill Benson:  It's good to know that you had som efolks that you've gotten to know thatwere 
in the sam e comm unity as you.
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  W hen I was a kid,
 
I didn't know anybody else would have this 
experience. I think the f irsttim e m y sisters and I went to a conferencef or theKindertransport, 
it was like, oh, there are other people who had this kind of thing. 
 
 
You didn't askm ethis, butone of the thin

m y sister Bertle doesn't think we're 
really sur vi vors.  And as I saidto Bertle, we had to leave our country, my parents were killed, I 

don'teven rem em berthem, all of thesethings happenedtom e.  It's notas terrible as people 
who were in cam psor
 
in hiding, but it certainly was som ething not tobe 
repeated.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Idon't
 
--
 
oh, there is.T herewe go.  Back in thefar
 
--
 
>> T hank youf or sharing your story with us. I'm  a m iddle schoolprincipal. I'm here with 150 
kidsf rom the Cleveland area.  I seea lot of  kidsf rom  around the country.  I have a questionf or 
you. W hat's the greatest message that youcan give to these young peopleas they prepare to 
enter the world as young adultsand as citizens of our country?  Certainly the issue 
of  b u llying 
is prevalent inour schools.  I think you really have something that you could share with them . 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You heard thatok?
 
>> Esther Starobin:  
I d
id hear that. I taught middle school.  I love m iddle school. 
 
 
I think for m e the fact
 
that you canhelpone person ripples off.  I was so lucky 
because individual people helped me and lovedm eand didthings. And I think mostof  usare 
not going to affecthundreds andthousands of people, but we can help one person. W e can 
stand up to someonewho is doing awf ul things to another person. And we can do it one

person at a tim e. 
 
 
And I think asm iddle school kids, too, to know the history
,  
to know the history of  our 
country and the changes that have come about inour country is im portant, too. Because we 

just assum ed lif e was like it was now.  And I know som eof  thethings I think are recent are 
ancient history tom iddle school kids. They need to know we still need to lookoutfor 
ever ybody and to appreciatepeople who aredifferentf rom  us.  Andcertainly as our country is 
changing and we're becom e am uchm orem ixed country, it's im portant to do that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkwe have tim efor onem ore question.  Ithinkthere was ahand up here.  

Yes. W e're going to bring you them ic.

W hen you were
 
--
 
when you were with the Harrisons, did you hear anything about thewar? 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou were with the Harrisons,did
 
you 
hear anything about the war that 
was going on?
 

>> Esther Starobin:  Not a lot because I never heardthe radio.  Buton the other hand,I had a 
ga s  m
askand we hadto get it tested
 
andthere were planesf lying over, dropping bom bs.  So 
yes and no.  Not like now when you listen to the radio and youhearall thenews.  I didn'thear 

it th a t wa y.  I li ve d  it.

to Esther to do that,I want to rem ind you that when shef inishes, she's going to step off the 
stage and head up toward the entrance where she will be available to sign copies of " Echoes 
of  Mem ory"  which shehas m ade contributions to. That could be anopportunity also to say hi 
to her andm eet herpersonally in that way. 
 
 
W ith that I'd liketo turn to Esther to close our program . 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  And I'd like to repeat what I said. 
 
I think the individual acts that we can do 
of  kindness, of helpingpeople to standupforwhat's right, really are i m portant and we needto 
continue to do thator to startdoing it if  we'renotdoing it.
