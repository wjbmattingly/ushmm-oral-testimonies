A: Today, I am 85 years old.
 
Q: Where were your parents born?
 
A: In Poland.
 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that?
 
A: Well, not much because my, my dad died 
when I was a young boy. And I hardly ever, 
h a rd ly  rememb er h i m at all. An d  my  mo th
er, she come from Poland here, you know, 
through New York. That's all 
I, th at's all I can remember.
 

Q: And what language did they  speak to you at home? 
 
A: Polish.  
 
Q: Where did you grow up? 
And can you tell me a little b
it about how you grew up?
 
A: Oh, I grew up in a little town, Natrona, 
PA: And I went to school there till, till I 
finished eighth grade. And af
ter that, I went to the Har-
Brack High School. And th en, 
from the high school, I was drafted into th e Army . And I had, I had a dull life, you know, 
just we played around. And I went, when 
th e war ended, you know, I was excited. I 
wanted to  join. And I did go to  try to join  
the Navy. And I was turned away because I was 
colorb lind. And 
that's about it.
 
Q: What's  your first memory from when you we
re growing up? What's 
the first thing that 
you remember?
 
A: Oh, my first memory
 wh en I was growing up, oh boy, th
at was a -- it sticks out in my 
mind that I was on a, on the boat. It was 
dark. And there was a steamboat coming down  
the river. And we always liked, as kids, go on
 the end of it, this steamboat. And here, I 
was pushed over. And I mu st have been about 
maybe five, six years old. I don't know. 
And they  couldn't find me. And finally, the wa
ves of the steamboat, I guess here I was 
underneath the boat bopping up. And the st
eam waves, the boat from the steamboat 
pulled me out from that boat underneath the bo
at. And they found me because I was up, 
and my  hand was waving in  the air like sa
ying good-bye. And that's  how I was found.
 
Q: Can you tell me what your first memo ry 
was when war broke out? What what's the 
first thing you rememb er about Wo rld War II?
 
A: World War II, I remember, o h , I was out play
ing in the alley with
 my buddies. And we 
heard the, you know, we heard from the news
papers, there was come  by, "Extra, Extra," 
they had. It was right after that, an d then
 it was saying about the war, we broke out, we 
were at war. And I mu st have been, I 
don't know, 13 years old. And th at's it.
 
Q: What do you rememb
er about being drafted?
 
A: Well, when I was drafted, I assumed that 
I would not go in to the 
service because I was 
turned down from 
the, from the Navy from being colorblind. And when I went, when I 
went to the draft board , I know the people th
ought I was too young to
 be there. I mean, I 
had a couple guys saying, "This is people go
ing in to the Army ." They couldn't believe 
that I was there is going in because I was 
so young looking. And skin ny and small. And 
I did go through the, for my physical. And I passed it, to my surpri
se. And then, when I 
was drafted, I went to Camp  Go rdon. I had 16
 weeks of basic training. Oh, the next, wh en 
I was drafted, the May, I think the next 
day, Germany surrendered. Ok ay. And then, 
when  I was in my  basic training, I was on my
 last couple weeks of training, when  Japan 

surrendered. And then, we thought we were a
ll going to  go home. Bu
t instead they, they 
shipped us to New York . And we
 shipped out to go overseas 
to, to France. And we were 
out at sea maybe two, three days. And all at
 once, there was a big hump , a big thump. 
And here, I thought our boat stopped just to 
have Mass on the deck . That's  because they 
announced we're going to have Mass on the de
ck. And here it was, here we hit a little 
boat. It was one of our little boats out ther
e. And I remember th
em picking up some 
survivors, and keep th e surv
ivors away from us. They were
 mo stly, you know, not living. 
They were dead. And then, we
 came back to New York. An
d we stayed in New York  
another 30 days doing nothing until we got 
another ship . And I shipped over, and I landed 
in Le Havre, France. And I remember that becau
se we have to stay in, in Le Havre, we 
stayed in little tents for about seven days till th
ey put us on the, in 
boxcars. They called 
them forty-and-eights. And we
 were on that boxcar for, I think it was seven nights and 
seven days. We stayed in that boxcar until 
we got to Nuremberg, Germany. And that's 
how I got to Germany.
 
Q: And what year was that?
 
A: Oh, what year? It was 1945. I was 
drafted May the 7th, I think, 1945.
 
Q: And how old were you?
 
A: 18.
 
Q: Was that your first trip to Europe?
 
A: Yes, it was.
 
Q: What were your first impressions? Wh at were your thoughts?
 
A: My first impression, oh, it was in Le Ha
vre, France.And I couldn't believe I heard, 
"Boom, boom." And said, "I thought the wa
r was over." And here, they were, like, 
demo lishing you know, out in build ings becaus
e they were not secure. And to me, when 
we were docking, and we ha
d French people, little boys begg
ing for cigarettes and candy. 
That's  what got me the most, how they
 were begging fo r cigarettes and candy.
 
Q: And what was your first impression of Germany wh en you got there?
 
A: Oh, well, I went through Germany, like I 
told you, seven days 
and seven nights. And 
then, we, we didn't see anything, you know. We 
just kept going. And we, we ate just our 

rations, our K-rations that we were, you know
, that we had. And one day in Germany, 
they stopped for a hot meal. And I would not gi
ve it up. I would not give up my  space in 
the boxcar, you know, so I miss
ed the meal. And it was, like, 
in the middle of the night. 
And so, what I seen of Germany was just, 
you know, ju st the land. No thing around it. 
Then, my first impression when
 I got to Nuremberg, wow, 
I couldn't believe it. I don't 
think there was a house standing in  Nu re
mb erg. And every house was down to the 

ground. And, you know, and it was a little shoc
king. And then, when th
ey put us in these 
SS Kasernes, I remember, and they had no mattr
esses. And th at's, we slept in our sleeping 
bags we were issued. And, I 
don't know, we didn't  have t
hose bags long until we did get 
mattresses. And we were, like,
 a high priority because we 
were going to be at the 
Nuremb erg trials, you know. So, 
we got mattresses sooner than mo st other GIs, I guess. 
And our windows were fixed. And that's my  
impression of Nu remb erg, the first time I got 
to Germany.
 
Q: Do you remember abou
t what date it was that you got to Nuremberg?
 
A: The day I got to Nuremberg, geez, well, 
I -- it was M ay the 7th, I was drafted, and I 
don't know. I spent 30 days waiting for a ship
. And then, when  I go
t to Nuremberg, it 
was, I don't know, it had to be ab out maybe a 
month or two after I was drafted. No. After 
I, I landed in Nuremberg. But I don't know what
 time I g o t there. Is 
that what you asked 
me?
 
Q: Yes. Yeah.
 
A: Yeah, I got to Nuremberg, well, I know 
it was in November. It w as cold, you know. 
But I don 't know the 
exact date right now.
 
Q: Did you interact much with
 the German population when  
you got there, or did you go 
straight to the site of the trial?
 
A: Oh, no. We were in, situated in our Kase
rne, and we stayed there for, like, 30 days. 
And we had orientations until wh
at we were going to do at the, at th e prison, you know. 
And because they told us we were going to  be
 prison cells in the cell.And we were going 
to guard walls. And we were going to secure 
doors. Entrances to the,
 in the prison. But 
not at the Palace of Justice. And -- wh
at?Oh, what did you
 want to know?
 
Q: If you interacted at all with --
 
A: No. With the Germans, no. 
We didn't speak to them at 
all.  You know, because, you 
know, the only time I would sp eak to German
 was wh en I would be, they would, like, 
take our clothes and wash them for us, you 
know. We had, like, 
one woman, she would 
been coming around, y
ou know, to do our laundry. And 
that's  the only one I would speak 
to. And --
 
Q: And did you speak any German?
 
A: No. None at all. None at all. A nd then
, like I say, right near where our SS Kaserne 
was, it was close to, to the, wh
ere Hitler used to parade his 
field. And I think they called 
it Soldiers Field. And I spent a lot of time 
there while I was awaiting to get, you know, 
you know, to get, to get our 
jobs in, at the prison. And I think I learned how to drive a 
Jeep there. That's  what I was doing. And then
, after we got orientation, I think my first 

time I went to the prison, it was very eerie. A
nd, and we work ed, we had to be there for 
24 hours. We would guard , we 
would guard them, we would 
be on guard fo r two hours 
and off four. And I will never forget my firs
t one I had was, oh, I think it was Sauckel, 
Sauckel. My first prisoner I ever guarded was Sauckel. And I remember going on maybe, 
like, I think it was 2 o 'clock in the morning,
 and I relieved my  man. And I looked in 
there, and he was sleeping. And, you know, 
I was nervous. I was 18 years old. And we 
were told, we were there, they can't escape. 
But we were there just 
to keep them alive, 
you know, to, you know, so th
ey can go through a trial. 
And I would look in  there and 
watch him. And he wouldn't  
be moving. He was sleeping 
soundly. And I didn't hear 
anything. And I thought he was gone, you know
, and I'm scared. And all at once, I'd see 
him move or breathe, and I would feel so re
lieved. That was my first experience with 
that, with a prisoner.
 
Q: I want to go back for just a moment. You 
talked a little bit abou
t how you were briefed 
and trained before you, before 
you actually started to guard.
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Could you tell me a little bit more about your job and your pos
ition was explained to 
you?
 
A: Well, all I can remember is we were, like,
 we were had, like, squads. And I would go 
in my  squad. And we would 
have a guy come up there, a
nd he wo uld just tell us, you 
know, what we're doing. And who these peop
le were. And, you know, to me, 18 years 
old, I didn't know what, who they
 were at all. I didn 't, didn't faze me at all. And, and 
that's all th ey said. Our main 
job was to just to keep them
 alive. You know, and that's 
about it. And then, they 
told us that we're going 
to  be on different, you'
re going to be on a 
cell guard for maybe, like I say two hours, and 
I'll be off four. And 
then, they put you, 
they say maybe we would go get an entrance 
of some kind to guard.
 And th ey would be 
off another four. And then, maybe you get on a 
wall. They just kept 
changing around 24 
hours. And we did th at just 
every, every day. We went to
, we went to the prison. And 
then, we'd  be off 24 hours, and we 'd  go b
ack on 24 hours. That's 
all. That's was my  
routine.
 
Q: Did you know anything at that point at
 age 18 about what had gone on Europe in 
genocide, ab out thes
e mens' role in -
 
A: No, I didn't know anything like that. I had 
no ideA : Bu t as I stayed there, you know, 
I'd hear a lot of people talking. And I realiz
e that we had, who we were guarding. And I 
guard ed, we had 20, 20 prisoners we guarded.
 And they were in the cell all by, all by 
themselves. And the ones, they would take th
em out, I think it was one day for one hour 
out to have, for their exerci
ses in the exercise yard. An
d you would just follow your 
prisoner out to the yard. And yo u had to keep your eye on 
your prisoner. And all of us 

guard s, 20 of us, I guess, was just all around 
surrounding him, just watching your own 
prisoner. And th ey were good. 
They knew what they had to
 do. We didn't have to do 
anything, you know. And it was very routin e. That's it.
 
Q: Can you tell me what the prison itself at
 N u remberg was like? 
What it looked like? 
How many prisoners were there tota
l, what the cells looked like?
 
A: Oh, what the prison looked 
like? Well, we'd go in, and we 
slept in the, in the cell. You 
know, for the 24 hours we were there, and 
it was just like a regular prison. I mean, it 
wasn't very nice. They had 
wooden doors with a little hole 
in it. You know, and that's 
where we used to put our light
 when they went to sleep, on th e prisoner. We had, we 
watched them for 24 hours. Bu t the prison wa
s just like a regular prison. It had th ree 
stories, three tiers, you know. And on th e first 
tiers were all the 22 prisoners we had. And 
that's it. And then, like 
in the, then, well, ju
st imagine the prison lik
e a, like a wheel. The 
prisoners had one, one block. And we had 
another block of a spoke-like. And we, and 
that was for us. Then , they had another spoke, 
it was just for the witn
esses. I thi nk there 
were like, you know, their wives and somebody 
in th ere. And, but they were allowed to  
walk in an d out of th eir cells up to 10 o'cl
ock in the mo rning. And then , in one other 
spoke was the military police,
 you know. And, and the wa
ll was a round wall. And we'd  
have to walk that wall. We'd  
get that sometimes, to walk th
e wall. And so , you know, just 
like a regular prison. Bu t it was, you know
, not very nice looking. It was old.
 
Q: So, did I understand you 
correctly, when you were guar
ding, when  you were on your 
shift for those 24 hours when you were guardi
ng a particular prisoner, were you in the 
cell with them?
 
A: No. We were outside the door. And like I sa
id, we had a hole in the door in a, a little 
hole. And that's where we wo
uld put our light, you know, we
 had a portable light there 
beside the door. And we would shine it on th
em at, when they went
 to sleep. And the 
door was not locked . It was just latched because they told us in case you see them doing 

anything, we 'd  have to go in  quickly. And th
at 's just the way it was. And we were only 
allowed to, oh, I think we were
 only allowed to , people that 
entered that cell would be a, 
it was a doctor. But he was a prisoner. Bu t he 
was a, I don't know, he was a, I guess they 
trusted him, trust a doctor. And he was allowed 
in there. And barbers, get their hair cut. 
And one other guy was there. Oh, he was 
our commander. Andrew s, I think his name 
was. He was the head of 
the, the guard s and that.
 
Q: And were you allowed to interact with 
the prisoners at all, 
or you were strictly 
guard ing from the outside?
 
A: Well, I did not interact with them becau
se, you know, mo st of them just would not 
speak to you. You know, and I, an
d they told us not to speak 
to them. But I seen a lot of 
guard s do speak to th em. And the only prisone
r that I spoke and had a conversation with 

was Albert Speer. And that's  b
ecause they came to me, and 
I was guarding him. And they 
asked me to take him to Room 55. And he wa
s going to see his lawyer. And all I had to 
do is sit between them and watch 
that they didn't pass any shar
p things to each other, like, 
a pencil or something sharp, y
ou know. And his lawyer was a littl
e late, so I got to talk to 
him a little bit. And he, to me, sounded like 
a real, you know, gentle
man, good guy. And 
he was, I think he was Hitler's architect. A
nd then, he was a pleasant guy. And then, I 
reme mb er t h en  mayb e 
a couple weeks later, I was on the,
 I had the duty of walking in 
with the barber to, for them to
 get their hair cuts or whatev er they wanted. 
Wh en  I w a lk ed  
in Speer's  cell this one time, he still rememb
ered me. I rememb er him fixing his bunk, so 
I could have a good seat. But as far as, and I 
talked to maybe, you kn ow, like, if, if they 
were in -- they had a commode in
 there. If they were in ther
e, stayed in there too long, 
well, then I would have to go in  and see 
wh at was going on becaus
e they had one guy 
commit suicide doing, on th e commode. And that 
was while I was, when  I just got there 
during the time I was o n  orientation. And th
e 26th Infantry was s
till guarding him. And 
then, and I think his name was Ley or somethi
ng like that. And after th
at, that's when we 
were told to watch them when
 they go into the commode. An
d that's  the time, I think, 
they put a, one guard on each
 cell. And that's how it was.
 
Q: Can you tell me what you talked
 about with, with Albert Speer?
 
A: Well, I didn't  say mu ch to him, but he wa
s telling me, like, he only got -- I don't think 
they hung him. He got, like, 20 years or some th
ing. And he said like,
 you know, he knew 
that, that, you know, he did wrong now and all 
that. And he was, like, you know, and he 
felt sorry. As the other ones would not even , yo
u know, mention to do 
that. And, and then 
when , then he asked me, you know, how long I 
had been  there, and I told him, you know. 

Stuff like there. And then, hi
s lawyer came, and they  spoke German. And I didn't know 
what they were speaking about.
 And after that, I just took 
him back to his cell. Oh, I, 
interaction with the prisoner? I had one, Herman, Herman Go ering, I, I was on his cell 

when  he had to go take his shower. You kn
ow, they got one show
er or two sh owers a 
week or something like that. And I was on hi
s cell, and I took him down . And th at was 
down stairs in the basement. I took him down . 
And, and I had to go into the place where 
he was going to  take his shower. And only
, I only had a blackjack on me. No weapon. 
And he complained about some
thing to me, and I didn't what he was comp laining about. 
So, I called the sergeant of the guard. And here
, he was complaining 
about the door being 
open because the draft was gettin
g him. And here, the sergea
nt of the guard, you know, 
told him the door had to be open  because 
we had another soldier there walking up and 
down  the corridor with a weapon. So, and that
 door had to be open. So, finally, he asked 
for another towel, and he got it. And he, inst
ead of taking a shower, he took a bath. And 
that's the only reaction I had w
ith him. But I was on his cell a 
lot, you know. And he ju st 
set there. And th ey just read. They 're looki
ng th rough papers, and 
that was about all. 
Some of them, before when they get up in th
e morning, Julius Streicher, I think, he was 

across from the, Goering. I had him one time,
 and he would get up,
 they were supposed 
to get up, I think, 7:30. And he would get up 
maybe a little earlier, 7, and he did exercises 
in his cell. And wh at I couldn't believe what he
 did, th ey didn't have any running water in 
the cell. So, he flushed his toilet a few times
, and he took the wa
ter and like put it over 
his shoulders and that to cool
 off. And then he would get, 
ask for his clothes. We had 
their clothes in another cell away from them. 
And we would bring thei
r clothes in for him 
to get dressed, and he was rea
dy for, for court. That's ab out 
it. That's all I can, and I know 
I was in a lot of other cells and that. And I walked the walls. That was, I didn't like 
walking that wall. It w as night, you know, and 
on the wall, we had a, a weapon. It was an 
automatic weapon. And, and we had, and then
, we used to guard  the doorways. You're 
coming into the cellblock
, or you're going out, we had to
 check them with their IDs. And 
we had to  see them around. We had to know 
them. And we also, then later on, we would 
out to, passwords like, like New Yo rk, and he
 would say Yogi Berra. And that was the 
one fo r the day. And every day it was differe
nt. When we went through a doorway. And 

that's and what else I had to
 do there. Oh, there was a w
itness wing. It was on the third 
floor. And th ere was only one guard there. On
e guard. And the witne
sses were  allowed to 
walk in an d out of th eir cells, you know, and mi
ngle. But at 10 o'clock, they had to be in  
their cells, you know, time to sl
eep. And I'll never forg et th
is. My job was, I was there on 
a New Year 's Eve. It mu st have been '45,  1945 New Year's Eve. And the, there was 
women, she was in charge, like, a lieutenant,
 and here she said she was going to  leave 
early because she's going to a party. And, you 
know, once they get in 
their cells, they'll be 
okay. And here, throughout ou
r, throughout the, you know, 
our ranks and throughout the 
prison, th ere was a story about one of these wo
men, they wore, she wo
re riding clothes. 
And wh at she would do, and I don't know if 
I should tell you this. This was wh at, the 
word  was out that she would strip, and you'd
 give her a candy ba
r or something. You 
know, and th en she would report the time, you 
know, the day, and the soldier was, would 
be disciplined. But when I got 
there, so I was nervous of her. I didn't know who she was 
or what. And then, I had one girl. And I gue
ss it was her. She kept coming in to the office 

and wanted to see the lieutena
nt. And I told her the lieutenan
t is going to be gone. You 
know, she come in a couple times
. And I finally had to  tell her that she had to  stay in her 
cell. And that's the last I seen of her. And th
at's, that's about it. And ev erything else was 
routine. Oh, we had another post. Oh, I re
memb er now. It was at the courtroom, you 
know, inside the courtroom wh en it was empty.
 They just had one guard in th ere. And all 
he had to do is make sure nobody got in th ere. 
And I just really had to just walk around in 
there for two hours. And that's all I did. I wa
s just amazed at the,
 you know, how small it 
was because all those people were in it. And yo
u know, I looked at th
ere, and I seen this 
one machine there. It was a stenotype machine.
 I remember I was rea
lly fascinated with 
that machine. And then , when  I got home, an
d I got discharged, I went to school for that, 
for the same machine to study the, you know, 
and I knew how to operate that. But I never 
used it. Maybe for a couple weeks,
 and that's  all. That's  about it.
 

Q: Did you ever get to observe
 a day in the courtroom itself?
 
A: Once. And I would, and the reason I wouldn't do it again is because it was too hard. 
And I had to go thro ugh a lot of paperwor
k ev en though I was a guard. They put you 
through a lot to get, to get a seat in the co
urtroom. You know, and when  I was there, they 
were talking about Admiral 
Doenitz, you know, wh at he, wh
at he has done. And it was 
really, I was amazed the way it was. I had a 
headset on. And if you 
would tu rn it to one, 
number one, he might, you woul
d think he was speaking Eng
lish. You tu rn it to number 
two, then he was talk, speaki
ng Russian. You know, it was r
eally funny to me. To listen 
to that trial that way. But 
that, yeah, I did go one time in 
the courtroom. And the other 
time I was in there was just when I had, that
 was one of our posts. But it was empty. But 
to, you know, just to go ther
e as a spectator, I did go once.
 
Q: Can you tell me specifically what they
 were talking about that day that you --
 
A: That day, I remember it was about th
e sea, Admiral Doenitz. Was that Admiral 
Doenitz? Yeah, I think it wa
s him. Yeah, kind of was a commander. Yeah, Admiral 
Doen itz, and he was the one on the stand that day. And I can 't remember what they were 

speaking about. But, you know
, I was just so amazed, you know, because I kept playing 
with those dials. But, but it was just like 
a courtroom as usual. 
They were asking him 
questions, and he would answer, 
you know. And th at's all I can reme mb er about that date.
 
Q: Do you reme mb er anything sp
ecific about his testimony or no?
 
A: About what?
 
Q: Anything specific about his testimony or no?
 
A: No. I have no idea what he 
spoke ab out that day. That's 
been so long. And I was just 
amazed how it was. And like I say, I was playing mostly with those dials.
 
Q: Did you ever overhear or understand any co
nversations that the prisoners had amongst 
themselves?
 
A: Well, the prisoners were, only time they we
re together was when they went out fo r 
their exercise. We had an exerci
se yard, they call it. And at fi
rst, we took all 20 of them 
out together. And whatever guard, and our, the gu
ards just stood around the exercise yard 
and watching your pris
oner. And as the court, as the c
ourt was going on, you know, the 
proceedings were going on, we noticed that we
 were just given so 
many prisoners go out, 
not all together. Like, maybe 18 or 15, you  know. And that was because, I think they 

were, some body said they we
re, you know, talking about the 
other prisoners. They were 
against them. And they became 
enemies. So they wouldn't ta
ke, send them out together. 
And I just remember h o w it started at the 
beginning with all 20 was out. Then , there was 
like 17. Then, it would, I can rememb er one 
time, we only had maybe ten of them out 

there. But, and they said th
at's because in the courtroom,
 they were blaming each other. 
So, that's  all I know about that.
 
Q: Did you notice anything about their behavio
r, either when they we
re in their cell or 
outside?
 
A: Oh, well, yeah. Well, Goering, he was very
, he was always just a nice guy, you know. 
He slept and read. An d Hess was in the next 
cell to him. And to me, Hess looked like he 
was a crazy guy. I mean, he just didn't speak.
 And he had this, and 
all I know about him, 
he had his window really open, and the draf
t would hit you right in
 the face when you 
come to his cell. And I never took care of his 
cell. It was dirty. And, like I say, most of 
them, like, you know, and they
 just didn't do anything. They played  cards. They  had a 
little table, a card table there. Not a table, a 
weak table there. They didn't have cards per 
se. They had homemade cards they would ma
ke. And they  would play  games with that, 
play a game with that. But they were always
 separated. They never were together. So, 
and like I say, I never spoke to them becaus e I just followed orders. I was afraid, you 
know, I was 18 years old. Bu t I seen some 
guys speaking to them, you know. But I did 
not. And it's, and it was all the same, you know 
-- oh, I told you about
 the guy that took, 
he did the exercises. They woul
d give his clothes for court. And th en, every time he went 
to court, he always asked the guard for so
me chewing gum. No matter who was, who 
was, who, who was his guard th at day. And, ye
ah, and like I say, they 
just, they just read. 
They  didn't do anything. That's it.
 
Q: You've said a couple of 
times that you were, you were a
fraid at certain points. Was 
that because it was a n ew situation, or were 
you afraid of the actual process of guarding 
them?
 
A: Well, you know, after you 're th ere, and I 
heard who they were and all that stuff, then 
mostly my afraid was I didn't want my pris
oner to die on me. Because that was so stuck 

in our heads. That's w h at I was afraid of mostly. When I 
had him for those two hours, I 
just wanted him to be alive when I left. A
nd that's the only thing I was afraid of. But 
really, after that, they were like nothing. 
You know, it was all just routine. And like I 
said, sometimes you would get into  the cellblo
ck maybe for one prisoner. And the rest of 
the time, y ou were on the wall, walking the 
wall. Or you were out guard ing a doorway. 
So, you know, they  changed us around a lot. 
For not to get, I guess 
it was because they 
didn't  want you to get too familiar with a pr
isoner. And that's what
 I heard they said.
 
Q: And had a, a suicide of a prisoner ha
ppened not too long befo
re you got there? Was 
that part of the, the fear of making sure
 that, that one of th
em didn't die on you?
 
A: Yeah, that, that was my fear. Y ou know, I 
didn't  want none of th em to die. Or, you 
know, commit suicide wh
ile I was there. You know, becaus
e we, all that we were told, 
"They're there to be hung." Th
at's all. To, you know, once the verdicts are out. And I was 

there from the beginning of the trial, the tria
l. Till the end of the 
trial.And then, after, 
when the verdicts came out, I 
wasn't there. A nd then, when
 it was the hanging, I was on 
my way home. So, I missed that.
 
Q: So, some of the prisoners that you had 
guarded were being hu
ng as you were leaving?
 
A: Who?
 
Q: Some of the prisoners w
ho you had previously guarde
d were being executed as you 
were leaving? As you were co
ming back to the United States?
 
A: Oh, there was, geez, who, the people that 
were executed, I think 
they had -- oh, God. 
It's so hard to rememb er, 12? And the ones th
at got the death sentences, I remember was 
Frick, I can remember. Goering. And Goering 
committed suicide a da
y, the night before 
his hanging. And I always said, I was, I wa
s on th e ship coming home, and I said, "I'm 

glad I wasn't there. And Alfred Jodl, he wa
s a really weird guy. He died. He was hung 
Kaltenbrunner was died, he was hung. And like, 
Hess, he got life. I think he, he was the 
longest living prisoner. And Ro
ss, Rosenberg. My first pris
oner I guarded was Sauckel. 
He got the death sentence. And 
there was some people that a 
got acquitted, like, Schacht. 
I remember him being acquitted. Yo
u know, it's, it's ha
rd for me to rememb
er now. It's so 
many years ago.
 
Q: Can you tell me at what point you starte
d to realize w ho these 
people were, and what 
they had done? You mentioned that before y
ou came to Nuremb erg, you really didn't 
have a good sense of what had g
one on in Europe during the war?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Was there a momen t that you 
rememb er that perception ch anged?
 
A: Yeah. It changed on me when I started 
hearing stories about 
how who the people we 
were guarding, you know. The guys were talki
ng, and then  I just realized, "Oh, my  God, 
I got some, you know, high, hi
gh officials here I'm guarding.
"So, you know, that put me 
on alert more and made me a better guard. But that's it.
 
Q: Did you have any family in Europe at
 that time, at that time during the war?
 
A: No, I didn't have anybody. Well, my mother
's sister  was there 
in Poland, you know, 
but that wasn 't too familiar with her becaus
e I, because we did, I remember us sending 
packages and maybe once every six 
months or so. That's about it.
 
Q: And did she remain  in
 Poland throughout the war?
 
A: Pardon?
 
Q: Did she remain in Poland Œ
 

A: Yes.
 
Q: -- throughout the war?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: And what did she do after the war?
 
A: What did I do?
 
Q: What did your mother's sister
, did she remain in Poland the re
st of her life, or did she -
-
 
A: My mother's sister
, yeah, she left her, sh
e stayed there the rest of her life. Once my 
mother died, we lost contact 
with her at all, y ou know.
 
Q: Can you tell me about your last day as a 
prison guard at Nuremb erg? Is there anything 
in particular you rememb er?
 
A: Oh, my last day, geez. Oh, God. Oh, le
t me see now, because I know we were happy 
we were getting off because there was only tw
o in fantry divisions that guard ed them, I 
think. Because when I got th
ere we guarded, it was the 26th Infantry we relieved. And I 
was in the 18th Infantry. And th
en, when we got the word we
 were going to  be leaving, 
we were all so happy you know, just getting 
out of there. And then, the 26th, and then, 
the 26 In fantry relieved us again. They  re
lieved us to go home. 
And my , my  last day 
there, oh God, I rememb er being on a doorw
ay, you know, and I was guard ing a door. 
And I just was so happy, you 
know, that I'm leaving. And I know I left a lo t of guys 
through, or I didn't ask them
 their pass, you know, the word
 for the day was. But no, I 
was just happy to get out of there. That's al
l . Just somethingnew, 
you know. Then, I went 
to Amberg, Germany.
 
Q: And what did you do th ere?
 
A: In Amberg, I became a squad leader. And th
en, they needed a company clerk. And my 
sergeant asked me if I'd be a comp any clerk, 
you know, to help th em
 out. I said sure. But 
when  I was, I was anxious to get my  sergean
t stripes, you know. And I wanted  to move 
up. And I knew as a company clerk that I wa
s a corporal, and that was all I'm g o ing to 
stay. But then, the sergeant said
 no, he was going to put me 
in for a sergeant because I'm 
only acting as a clerk. And my  real job is a 
squad leader. But then, 
this was after the war. 
And then , when  he put me in 
for sergeant, I was denied. And that was because we had a 
lot of people coming in, you know, coming ba
ck from the, you know,
 the war. You know, 
and there were a lot, a lot of sergeants. So
, they  didn't give anybody anymore, you know, 
promotions. So, I come home as a comp any cl
erk, my last job, and as a corporal.
 
Q: And how long were yo
u in Amberg, Germany?
 

A: In Amberg? Oh, geez, I don't k n ow. I wasn
't there too long. I was maybe there, oh, 
maybe a few months. And I, well, what we di
d there, we, it was weird because that's 
when  the war was over. And the people, the sold
iers that were married were allowed to 
bring their wives over. And wh at we did, 
we had to go guard a home, one of the 
Germans' home, and somebody would mark the,
 the contents of the house. Excuse me. 
Give my  water a sip. They would mark the 
contents, like, the chair, they would have 
underneath it, would have a mark, and that wa
sn 't allowed to leave that building, you 
know. The only people, stuff that
 wasn 't  marked was allowed to leave. And that was what 
I did in Amberg. Until, until I 
got my discharge. Then, I went to, I think -- I didn't get 
discharged there. I went to Copen, no. I forg
et where I, I come -- I come in Le Havre, and 
I went out someplace else. I can 't remember.
 
Q: And who lived in  those houses that you we
re guarding? Or were you guarding the 
houses themselves in Amberg?
 
A: We were just guarding, they were, th
ey were empty. And I guess some kind of 
Germans lived there. And they  were saving 
those houses for the wives that are coming 
over. Officers mostly.
 
Q: And at that point, when you were in
 Amberg, do you rememb er anything about 
interacting with the local population or any su
rvivors, or was it really just you and your 
company?
 
A: Well, no. I relaxed. I, I rememb er going swimming there, and I was really, you know, 
it was in the summer. I went swimming. And I ta
lked to a girl. That's about it. And, well, 
and then , we had like a house club. We had a 
beer only. There were 
some Germans there.  
But that was, like I said, I was shy. I was 18.
 And I just stayed aw
ay from them mostly. I 
had interactions once. I was in a bomb she
lter. I was selling cigarettes, the carton of 

cigarettes. I didn't smoke. And I remember 
we got $50.00 a carton. And it was from some 
kind of, I think it was some Polish people 
coming through there. And we were dealing 
with the, I was dealing with 
th is one Polish guy in a, and 
here somebody 
come into the 
bomb sh elter, had a light, a flashlight. And I 
got scared. I thought, "Uh-oh," and here it 
was my  buddy. And I got my , I got $50.00 a carton for cigarettes. And th at lasted me 

because then I saved my pay. 
And he paid me in marks just
 like the same marks that we 
got paid from the Army. But I didn't, I didn'
t interact too much 
with Germans. But I 
reme mb er, like, in our club there, we had a 
 house, and I reme mb er dancing with the 
Germans. You know, but that was lik
e too young for that. I don't know.
 
Q: What do you rememb er about when
 you came home to the Un ited States?
 
A: When I came home to the United States? Well--
 
Q: What did you do?
 

A: Well, when I came into the United States
, the, I got home, and I went to work. I 
worked for a PPG Comp any, Industries. And I 
started to work . And 
I stayed there for 40 
years. And I retired from there.
 
Q: And what was your profession?
 
A: Pardon?
 
Q: What was your profession? What was your job?
 
A: Oh, I was on the shipping, sh ipping de
partment, you know. And sometimes, I would 
be a foreman. When my foreman would take 
vacation, I would take his place. And that's 
about it.
 
Q: So, lo oking back, wh at stands
 out the mo st during your time as a guard at Nu remb erg? 
Is there any experience or --
 
A: Well, yes, you know, because when  I was, 
you know, in Natrona, I lived. And th en, I 
moved to Carlisle. And in Carlisle, they got 
a War College here. And, a lot of my friends 
were retired colonels, you kn
ow, like I was a memb er of the Knights of Colu mbus. And 
that's where I met all 
these officers. And, you know, we'd
 talk about, you know, about the 
war, and you know, Army . And 
I told them where I was. 
And they thought that was 
really big history, you know, that I, you know
, I should stop by. I never did. I just, you 
know, forgot about it. I said
, "Naw, I'm not going to do anyt
hing." Until, and, until, and 
there is a D ickinson College here. And I 
used to go sw imming there and use the gym. 
And I got to know the girl at 
the desk there. And I told her my  story. And I think sh e 
knew somebody at the Holocaus
t Museum.  I forget her --
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Her first name is
 Bonnie Way, or something like that?
 
A: Yeah, Bonnie, she's the one
 that worked at the college
. And she called some body at 
the Holo caust and give them my  name. And 
then, I got a call from her. And that was, 
like, oh, maybe a year or two ago because sh
e wanted me to come down there and record  
my story. And I fell off the roof, and I was 
laid up. Like, when I learned how to walk 
again and all. And I just forgot about it then
. And then , it came  up again. And I guess this 

is when I got in
 touch with you.
 
Q: So, it's been, it's only been  
fairly recently that you've r
eally thought of your story as 
something th at's historically significant 
that you, that you should tell someone about?
 
A: Well, yeah. Well, a lot of 
people in Carlisl e, these Army 
guys, you know, they thought 
I should, you know. And because in all the 
time I lived in Natrona, I don't know how 
many years, 20 years, you know, 
after the war probably, and I just forgot about it. I didn't 
do anything. Until I came here. 
And like I said, I met a lot of
 Army people here. They got 

this War College, and they go there and retire 
from there. And th ey stayed here, and, and 
we became friends.
 
Q: And what do you, what do you rememb er
 the mo st?What's your strongest memo ry 
from when you were a guard at Nure
mb erg? What sticks out the most?
 
A: What sticks out the mo st
 when I was a guard at Nure
mb erg? Well, I would say the 
time I took Albert Sp eer to Room 55. That w
ould be the thing. Because I got my  biggest 
scare when I was walking behind him because,
 like I say, I was only 5-6, 145 pounds or 
something. And wh ile I was taking him to his 
room, he turned  around. His, like I got so 
scared, I froze. And he just tu
rned around and kept on walk
ing. And like I told you, once 
he got in a room, his lawyer wasn 't there, an
d I started talking. We 
started talking. And I 
thought he was pretty nice.
 
Q: What did you talk about?
 
A: Well, he talked mo stly about his, you know
, his, his life in Germany, wh ich he thinks, 
he knows he did wrong. And, you know, stuf
f like that. And he did 
not, he did not -- he 
wasn't hung. I think he got only ten years or 
20 years. So, he wasn't , he was pretty nice.
 
Q: And he spoke in English?
 
A: Yes, he did. Yeah , that's another thing w
hy, because, you know, a lot of them wouldn't 
speak English, just German. And I would, you 
know, we wouldn't  talk
 to them. But I was 
surprised. He did it. He, and I spoke to Sch
acht. He was another guy spoke really good 
English. But I think he was acquitted. He
 was a financier for Hitler. And he was 
acquitted. And he spoke English pretty good.
 
Q: Are there any other specific prisone
rs who you rememb ered that you Œ
 
 A: Other prisoners?
 
Q: -- that you would like to tell us about?
 
A: Stand out?  Oh, God, they all did the same 
thing. They all went to bed. Well, and like I 
said, Jodl, that exercise thing 
he used to do in his cell. That stood out to me.And, no, I, 
just, and like I said, it was all routine. We 
would go to  guard there fo r 24 hours, and 24 
hours we would be back at the SS Kaserne.
 
Q: Is there anything else a
bout your, your either your 
experience at Nuremb erg or 
looking, looking back now wh en 
you started to realize it was important? Is there anything 
else you would like to tell me about, either sp
ecifically what you did at the prison or 
about how you sort of think about it now?
 
A: Well, when I talked about th
e prison, I just remember when
 I used to walk the wall, it 
was cold. Very cold. And, 
you know, we had these over
coats in the Army . And you 

would never wear them. But I used to wear th
at on that wall. And I remember we had to 
go, you know, we had our pos
t from one post to another pos
t walking. And I think we 
had three, three men on the wall guarding. 
And I was always a little frightened when it 
was dark because I was always thinking so me
body from the outside 
is going to crawl up 
there, you know, and grab me, 
you know. Like I say, I was y
oung. And, and the guarding 
the cells, y ou know, it was just 
all routine. We'd  
come in there, do our two hours, off 
four, maybe go someplace else. And then, you 
come back to the cell. But what, you 
know, while you're guarding them, they 're either doing some
 kind of paperwork or sitting 
or sleeping, you know. It was nothing to  
talk about really. 
And that's about it.
 
Q: Is there anything that I haven't as
ked you about that you'd like to tell us?
 
A: That you haven't asked me about? Oh, Go
d, let's see, well, I -- we had guys, you 
know, like, I was a cell guard . And we had a 
couple guys from our place, it was a couple 
guards in our place that had the job in courtr
oom, you know, stood behind the prisoners. 
And they had the white helmets o n , you know
, and th e white belts. Whereas we had, you 
know, just the green helmet on 
and the, and the dark belt. An
d I just looked up to them, 
that's all. I thought they, th
ey had a neat job. And they  
looked good. And wh ile I was in 
Amberg, I remember that I had, got R&R, seve
n days off, like, a vacation. An d I went to 
Berchtesgaden. And up in the, and I thought
 that was something,
 you know, on that 
trolley up in, up in the mount
ains there, and you're up above
 the clouds. I thought that it 
was so pretty. You know, and I couldn't believ
e it. And then, we had tours that, I think it 
was Hitler's, some kind of cave I was in in
 Berchtesgaden. And where Hitler lived, you 
know, we went around there as a, just as a 
tour. And that's it. I 
can 't remember. My job 
was very routine.
 
Q: Have you been  back  to Germany since that time?
 
A: No. I would love to go back , but it's so 
expensive now. I would love to go back  and 
just to see the prison, you kn
ow. And my wife and I were talking about, it was a cruise. 
And this cruise was going to stop in German
y, Nu remb erg. And we inquired about it, and 
they told  us that you could go in to the cour
troom. There's a, they had people take you 
through the courtroom. But th
rough the prison, it was locked
. They  would not let you go 
through there. And th at's, that was my  big thi
ng. I wanted to go in 
and see the prison, you 
know, and th e places where I was. The places wh
ere I stood. But they  said that was, they 
did not give, you know, tour
s in the prison except 
only in the courthouse.
 
Q: Why did you want to go back  to the pr
ison specifically? Why did you want to go 
back?
 
A: I just, why did I want to go back  there?
 
Q: Yeah. Why, why did you 
want to revisit the prison?
 

A: I just want to back and relive the life I 
lived when I was there because after, now, I 
know it was such a historic thing I did. And, yo
u know, it's just nice 
to go back  and see it. 
See what it's like now. It's 
different, you know, probab ly.
 
Q: Mr. Gardner, is there anything el
se that y ou would like to tell me?
 
A: No, I cannot think of anything else.
 
Q: I want to thank you very much for your
 time. And on behalf of th e Un ited States 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum, thank you very 
mu ch fo r your testimony. I will now stop 
the recording.
 
A: Okay .
