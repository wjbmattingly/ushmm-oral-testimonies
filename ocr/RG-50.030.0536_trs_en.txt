Question: Dr. 
Friedberg
, welcome to 
Washington
. 
Answer: Thank you. Glad to be here. 
Q: It™s very nice to see you.
 Te Œ was Œ was your name 
Maurice Friedberg 
wh en  
you were born? 
A: Yes. 
Q: So it didn™t change at all? 

A: No, it du Œ did Œ it did not. 
Q: Did you have a middle name? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: There are no middle names in eastern
 Europe
. 
Q: And what Œ when  were you born? 
A: I was born on December 3
rd
, 1929 in 
Rzeszó w
, which is a large city in between 
Kraków
 and what used to be either 
Lviv
, or 
Lvov
, or 
Lemberg
.  
Q: But you Œ you weren™t rais
ed there, is that correct? 
A: No, I was raised in 
Jaroslaw
, which is a city on the 
San
 river, again betw een 
Rzeszó w
 and 
Kraków
. 
Q: So it™s fairly near 
Rzeszó w
. 
A: Yes, it is.

Q: Yes. And how co me you were born in 
Rzeszó w 
and then went to 
Jaroslaw
, do 
you know? 
A: Yes, because my mother wanted to give  birth in the city 
where my Œ where her 
father and mother and other relatives were. 

Q: I see. 

A: Which was 
Rzeszów
. 
Q: Right. Tell me  a little bit about your 
family. Tell me about your relationship with 
your father and your mo ther. Do  you reme
mb er? I mean, not when  you were a baby, 
of course. 

A: Yes. 
Q: But I mean when you 
were a little bit older. 
A: When I was a little bit olde
r, we used to spend Œ spen
d summers with Grandpa in 
Rzeszó w
, and I had another gran dfather in 
Jaroslaw
, who was the grandfather on 
my father™s side, and the rest 
of the time Œ time, we lived in 
Jaroslaw
 on th e 
San
 
river. And it was a normal, middle class Jewi
sh household. Moderately observant, I 
would not say strictly observant. And my  
father had a lumb eryard, and they  also 
manufactured some bricks, and they built sm
all houses with those bricks and with 
other building materials that were available.
 And that™s the way Œ and th at™s the way 
my  ch ild hoo d  is rememb ered  in  my  min d .  Th
e business that my father ran was very 

much like the business that my
 maternal grandfather ran. It was a middle of the road,

not very large, not very  small, but old e
nough and large en ough to  provide them with 
a livelihood, and that™s the way I remember
 it, by September 1, 1939, which was the 
day when  Nazi 
Germany
 attacked 
Poland
. And my first wartime memory is Œ 
Q: Can Œ can we Œ can we
 go back a little b it? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Ju-Ju-Just bef-before Œ before the war. 
Because your brother 
was born in 1932, is 
that correct? 
A: That is correct, yes. 
Q: What was your relationship with your father like? Was it Œ was it a close 

relationship before the war? 
A: It was Œ it was a reasonably close rela
tionship with my  father and my  mo ther. 
And my mother was the stricter o f the tw
o, and my  father was the one that you 
always would run fo r shelter and assistan
ce wh en  my  mo th er 
was getting too tough. 
Q: And what ki Œ how tough did sh e 
get? What Œ wha-wh at did she do? 

A: Well, she wou Œ she would slap me on my
 behind, or she would take away some 
privilege, or Œ or some special kind of de
ssert food. And this 
was, again, quite 
common in those days. 

Q: So you ran to your father to get protection? 
A: Right. 

Q: And did he protect you? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

A: He usually did. He would 
tell her to take it easy, or it
 was really not so bad, you 
know, so wh at do you want from him, he
™s only a boy. Things of that kind. 
Q: And was this rather typical in that Œ 
in households that you rememb er, that the 
mother was much strict
er than the father? 
A: Yes, I remember it as being exactly that way. 
Q: Uh-huh. And did you have 
meals with your parents? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And wou Œ three meals? Did your fa
ther co me home for lunch? Do you 
reme mb er? 
A: My father did not come home for lunch, he would take Œ he would take some 
sandwiches with him to wo rk. So  I reme mb er him at breakfast and I reme mb er him 
at dinner. 

Q: And did you have conversations at dinner Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ or was it very quiet? 
A: No. 

Q: No? 
A: Th-There were conversations, but not
hing very exciting or very  important, 
because after all, I was at 
the most, nine years old. 
Q: Right.

A: And my younger brother was 
two and a half years younger. 
Q: Right. And was this Œ y
ou s Œ you said that your mo
ther was somewhat religious, 
was the household very re
ligious? Were you kosher? 
A: Yes, we were kosher, but being kosher di
d not consi Œ it was not
 consid ered being 
strongly religious, this was the mi ni
mu m religiosity that was expected. 
Q: Did you go to synagogue? 
A: Yes, we went to synagogue quite regular
ly with my  father and grandfather, and I 
even remember where we
 sat in the synagogue. 
Q: Where? 

A: To the right side of the Œ of a Œ th
e place where they kept the Torah scrolls. 
Q: And this was an Orthodox synagogue, so the wo men were separate? 

A: There were no Œ th ere were no non-Orth
odox synagogues in that part of the 

country. 

Q: Right, right. 
A: They were all Orthodox. 
Q: Right. So did you wear a 
kep ele
? 
A: Yes, of course. 
Q: You did. And we
re you Œ did you we
ar Œ did you have 
payos
 as a young boy? 
A: No. 
Q: You weren™t Has-Hassidic.

A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: I did not have Œ I did not have 
payos
, and I attended a state Polish school in the 
morning, and a moderately strict 
cheder
 in the afternoon. 
Q: Uh-huh. And the regular school that yo
u started going to when  you were Œ did 
you start when you were 
five or six years old? 
A: About that. 
Q: And did you like school? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You liked it. 
A: Yes, I did. 
Q: And you went to a regular school, or 
did you go to a private Jewish school? 
A: No, I went to a regular state sch ool. 

Q: Uh-huh. And did you have a lo t of friends? 
A: Not th at many, but I did have a few. 
Q: And were these friends Jewish
, non-Jewish, do you remember? 
A: Most of my friend were Jewish.  
Q: So the Œ the Œ where you lived, 
was it mai n ly a Jewish neighborhood? 
A: That™s correct, it was predominantly Jewish.

Q: Uh-huh. And wh at sort of a home did y
ou have? Did you have a house, or did you 
have an ap artment, do you remember? 
A: Yes, we had an apartment, and I even 
saw that apartment after the war, when we 
visited 
Poland
, and I remember the address, it was the 
Slovaski
(ph) Street, house 
number 14 on th e second floor. 

Q: Mm, so you were on one floor, the Œ of
 a house, and someone else lived below 
you? 
A: No, someone else lived beside us. 
Q: I see. 

A: Right. 
Q: And when your brother was born, was th
is a difficult time for you, or were you 
happy to have him Œ an-another sibling? Do  you rememb er? 
A: I don™t remember. 

Q: You don™t remember? 
A: No. 
Q: Okay. Do you remember if
 politics were discussed at a
ll, so that by the time the 
Nazis attacked in 1939 th
at you were expecting th
is, did you hear things? 
A: We heard things, we were expecting thin
gs. It was not unusual, and it was not at 
all uncommon for politics to be
 discussed at the table. 
So that when the Nazis 
attacked on September 1, 1939, it did not 
come as a surprise. 
An d  my  first me mo ry

of the war was a Nazi airplane flying very
 low, and so mebody living in the same 
apartment build ing jump ing out of the house 
with a small revolver, the kind of Œ the 
kind that ladies would have in th ei
r bags, and he shot at that plane. 
Q: Really? 
A: Right. And it was to me a symbol of fu
tility of resistance, because there wasn™t a 
thing that this pla Œ that this
 shooting could do to  the plane. 
Q: So even at such a yo
ung age you thought that? 
A: Yes, right. 

Q: Mm-hm. But i-in Œ in 19
39 in September, your father was already in the Po lish 
army, is that correct? So his Œ 
A: Right, he was in the Polish army Œ he 
was in the Polish army
 because there was a 
call to arms, you know, asking all eligible ma
les to present themselves at this, that 
and the other place. But as it tu
rned out later on, they didn™
t even get to provide them 
with uniforms, let alone with
 arms, when the Polish army 
was crushed by the Nazis. 
Q: So where yo Œ you went 
with  your mo th er and your
 brother, an-and Œ and was Œ 
did you go with your 
grandparents to 
Tarn opol
? 
A: No, no, because
 they were in 
Rze s zó w
, and we were in 
Jaroslaw
. 
Q: Right. 
A: So one morning a couple of
 Nazi soldiers and local co
llaborators appeared in Œ in 
our ap artment and th ey gave us five minut
es to get ready, and they  deported us on

the other si Œ to the other side of the 
Sa n
 river, which was to become the Soviet zone 
of occupation, as distinct from the German
 zone of occupation,
 which they decided 
to make free of Jews. 
Q: So you were deported, th
is wasn™t Œ this wasn™t a decision that was made by your 
mother to Œ to leave. 
A: That™s correct, that™s correct. A nd I re member we arrived at the bridge on the 

river, and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor. There was a Œ a roadside Œ 
a roadside sign which says in German, 
nach Palä stina
, to 
Palestine
. And we were 
just Œ we were just pushed to th e other 
side of the river, and then the Germans 
returned to their side of the river, and we
 were on the other side for a few days, and 
it was not clear what those few days w
ill bring, and where we will end up. I 
remember we stopped in this small Jewish town, and my mother wanted a place 

where she could wash me and my  kid brot
her. And it turned out that the only place 
where you could get washed was the local 
mikveh
, the religious bath house where Œ 
where women would immerse themselves af
ter their periods, to make themselv es 
again clean. And in that little town, it wa
s a town with a single industry. The 
industry was making 
twittel
(ph) Œ making the phylacteries
 that observant Jews used 
for prayers on their hands, on their arms a
nd on th eir forehead. An d then a few days 
later we met my father, who was looking 
for us because the army, the Polish army 
disintegrated, and the Œ there was absolute
ly nothing else for him to do. And there

were people roaming around looking fo r de
ported relatives and friends. And that™s 
how Œ and th at™s how he found us. 
Q: Did he know that you had gone to 
Tarn opol
? 
A: No. But he figured  it out because that 
was the only relative that we had on that 
side of 
Poland
. And so  he went to 
Ta rno pol
, and so did we, and that™s where we 
met. 

Q: So, you were 
not deported to 
Ta rnopol
, you were deported over the 
San 
river. 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: And Œ and th en you had 
to figure out what to do. 

A: That™s right. 
Q: I mean, your mo ther had 
to figure out what to do. 
A: That™s right, right. 
Q: And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to 
Tarnopol
, were they 
terrible? I mean were there Œ were there a lot of people?  
A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they
 were not terrible, because there were no 
shortages, and whoever lived in that area 
would try to share with us some food or 
whatever else was available. 

Q: So, when you were sent over to the 
San 
river, that Œ that Œ you were walking, I 
gather. 
A: That™s correct. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
13
Q: Did you have a little backpack Œ not 
a backpack, but a knapsack with you or 
something? 
A: Yes, yes. So would have
 Œ so you would have some
 laundry to change into . 
Q: Right. 

A: And I think an extra pair of shoes or something like this. 

Q: Right, but you couldn™t carry anyt
hing very  heavy, clearly, right? 
A: No, no, of course not. 
Q: Did your Œ did your mo ther
 carry some food with her? 
A: A little, but not much. Again Œ agai
n, it was some bread and cheese. 
Q: Right. And, did you walk to 
Tarnopo l
 th en ? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And were there Œ you had 
relatives there, I gather. 
A: My mother™s sister lived in 
Tarnopo l
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So th at™s where we went. 
Q: And you went there and you st
ayed there in Œ in their home? 
A: We stayed in their home for seve
ral months until the deportation to 
Russia
. 
Q: So it was just a few  months? 

A: Just a few months. 

Q: So you get there in September, and you leave Œ 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
14
A: And we left next spring, when the Œ th
e Russian authorities as
ked all the refugees 
who came from the other side, who expresse
d their preference, the preferences being 
to remain a Soviet citizen and stay at 
Tarnopol
, or to go back to the places from 
which they were ejected by th
e Nazis, which is what we 
chose to do, because that™s 
where most of the family was, in 
Rzeszó w
, and so me even in 
Jaroslaw
, because not 
all of us were deported of the same day. 
Q: I see. So you wanted to go back. 
A: We wanted to go back because we wa
nted to be together with the others.  
Q: Right. But this was a ruse by the Russians Œ 
A: That™s correct. And one night they appe
ared in my aunt™s 
apartment, and they 
read our names and they said, you will have
 your wish carried 
out, and they took us 
to the railroad station, put us in cattle cars,
 an d we were supposed
 to go to the other 
side of 
San
 river, but instead wh en the train began to move, it became obvious that 
we were moving in  the direction of ea
st, rath er than west, and east was 
Russia
. 
Q: Right. We Œ let me go back a little b
it. What Œ what was it like for you on 
Tarnopol
? Was this a difficult time for you, or was it okay? 
A: It was okay. It was not very difficult 
because there was no Œ th ere was no strict 
rules about behavior or buyi
ng or selling food. So , you 
know, th-there were a few 
rules, which were not terribly strictly obser
ved, until they put us in those cattle cars 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

and begun to move in th e direction opposite 
to the one that we expected to be moved 
to. 
Q: Right, right. So it wasn™t Œ so Œ so yo
u Œ did your father wo
rk during that period 
of time in 
Tarnopol
? 
A: Yes. 

Q: He did. Where did he wo rk? 

A: He Œ he worked on behalf
 of the authorities examining state property to make 
sure that nothing would collapse, or burn 
down, or get stolen. Bu t again, this was a 
very pro forma kind of arrangement, which wa
s supposed to change into mo re perm-
permanent one, until Œ until we were sent 
to those cattle cars, and until the train 
began to move east. 

Q: And your brother was okay? 

A: My brother was okay. 

Q: Did Œ did you have s-separate r
oo Œ I mean, ha Œ what were your 
accommodations like when you were staying w
ith your Œ your mother™s sister? Did 
you have separate rooms, or what?  

A: No, no, we Œ the accommodations were, I 
think we slept in the kitchen, and they 
slept in the bedroom. 

Q: I see. So they had a small home. 

A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

16
Q: Right. Did your father get paid for this work? 
A: He got paid some, in the form
 of food rations, military rations. 
Q: Uh-huh. Now, your moth
er didn™t work, I gather? 
A: No. 

Q: Right. And what was your Œ the husband 
of your mo ther™s sister, what wo rk did 
he do? Was he under the Russians also?  

A: He was under the Ru ssians also, and he
 tried to get some govern ment approved 
work, but they didn™t 
get around to it.  
Q: Were you, by the way, as a Œ 
I mean, now you are 10 years old. 
A: Right. 
Q: Right? Or 11 years old. 
A: 10 Œ te Œ 10 years old. 

Q: Yes. Were you frighte
ned about going back to 
Poland
, or did you not think about 
that? 
A: I didn™t think about that. 
Q: You didn™t. So, was there talk about 
what the Nazis were
 doing, what the Œ 
A: No, th e Nazis were not doing Œ 
Q: They weren™t doing mu ch. 
A: They were not doing much
 that early in the game. 
Q: Right. So nobody was that afra i d . 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
17
A: No. 
Q: Right. Okay, so the Russians take you,
 they claim that th
ey™re gonna send you 
back to 
Poland
, but they don™t. 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: So they send you east instead of west. 

A: Right. 

Q: And where do you Œ and what™s the Œ what™s the train  like? 
A: The train was, oh about 
15 or 20 car Œ cars filled wi
th people, and locked. And 
inside you had a hole so you 
could pee in Œ in it. But othe
r than that, again, there was 
nothing special, except that they distribut
ed a little water to drink, and a little bread 
to eat.  
Q: Were you fr Œ was this 
a frightening time for you? 

A: Yes, it was already, because we didn™t
 know where we were Œ where we were 
going, and why we are being sent there, a
nd what we have to 
do once we arrive. 
Q: And you™re Œ and you™re
 with  your Œ your brothe
r and your mother and your 
father? 

A: That™s correct. 
Q: Were you also with your
 mother™s sister an d her Œ 
A: No. 
Q: They had se Œ 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

A: Because Œ because she was c
onsidered a Soviet citizen Œ 
Q: I see. 
A: Œ with out any question. 
Q: Right. So she could stay there. 
A: Right. 

Q: Right. Do  you Œ do you rememb
er your parent
s being nervous? 
A: Yes, of course they were ne
rvous, but so was everybody else. 
Q: Yes. 

A: And the assumption was that
 whatever happens 
to the rest of us will happen to us, 
and we can do nothing to change it. 
Q: Uh-huh. So do you reme
mb er how Œ ab out how long 
the trip was in the Œ 
A: The trip was about Œ the trip 
was about Œ close to two weeks. 
Q: Two weeks? 
A: Yes, because very often we would arrive
 at a junction, and they would just leave 
us there for a day or two. 

Q: Outside of the ca
ttle car or inside? 
A: No, inside. 
Q: Inside? 
A: Inside the cattle car. 

Q: So are they giving you 
food every day, and water 
a little bit, or nothing? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

19
A: No, they would give us a little 
food and a little water every day. 
Q: Uh-huh. So you were Œ you mu st have fe
lt as if you were starving, in so me way. 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: And was the cattle car
 filled with people? 
A: Yes. 
Q: So there are no seats. 

A: No seats.  
Q: So were you sitting on the floor as a kid? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: You were. 
A: Right. 
Q: Were a lot of people
 sitting on the floor too Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: They were. 
A: Right. 
Q: So there was enough room Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ so that people could actu
ally sit, if they felt like it. 
A: Well, th-they could sit, but
 not if they wanted to lie. 
Q: Right. Did you sleep? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

20
A: Yes. 
Q: But it must have b
een very noisy, and Œ 
A: It was extremely noisy. 
Q: Œ and smelly. 
A: And smelly, and nobody knew where th
e hell we were going, and why. And fo r 
how long. 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 nobody said anything. 
A: Nobody sa
id a thing. 
Q: Right. So two weeks of this
, and then wh ere do you end up? 
A: And we ended up in what was then 
Sverdlovsk
 province, which is now 
Yekaterinburg
 province after they changed the na
mes back to th e pre-Soviet ones. 
And they Œ and I actually saw the 
barracks, which still stand there. 
Q: Really? 

A: I mean, I was there Œ I was 
there after the end of the Soviet regime. So we went to 
the Œ the 
Yekaterinburg 
province, not too far from the large city of 
Tyumen
, and 
within that, there was a lumber procuremen
t barracks, and that™s where I got Œ they 
left us. They got us all together an
d they said, you™ll be work ing here on 
procurement of lumb er for the needs of the 
Soviet state. And you better get it in your 
mind that if you work hard, we™ll feed yo
u. If you don™t work hard, we won™t feed 
you, and then you™ll starve to death and we
™ll bury you here, because there is plenty

of room for all of you, and that is the way 
it is with people who are trying to resist 
the needs of the Soviet state. 
Q: And who was this that sp
oke to you? Do you remember? 
A: Ah, yes. I even remember his name. His n ame was 
Skavaroatnikov
(ph) which 
literally Œ which literally me
ans the spatula and frying pan. He Œ he was Œ he 
represented the authorities, more di
rectly authorities of the Œ of the 
NKVD
, which 
was the Soviet secret police. 
Q: Mm-hm. Now, when  you were Œ 
you were brought into barracks? 
A: Right. 
Q: And is that where you lived as 
a Œ you lived as a family there?  
A: We lived as a family, plus a-an older 
brother of my  mother™s, who was deported 
with us because he was Œ he 
was in with us together in 
Ta rnopol
 at her sister™s. So, 
my father went to work immediately to ne
xt day, and this uncle of mine, being a 
traditional Orthodox Jew, decided that he™
ll first s-say his prayers. And as he was 

saying his prayers, the 
KGB
 or 
NKVD
 or secret police commander came in, took 
out a watch from his pocket, and said ther
e is no way you will ge
t to work on time. 
So we are going to send you
 to a different camp. And they send him to a stricter 
camp Œ camp, with a solitary, 
with common criminals. An
d he was beaten there by 
the common criminals, so mu
ch so that when he ca
me back, he was insane. 
Q: This was 
Ephraim

Q: Let™s go back to 
Ephra im
 fo r a mo ment. Do you Œ do you re Œ you remember 
Ephraim
 fro m 
Tarnopol
, and then the Œ on the ride to 
Sverlovsk Œ Sverdlovsk
? 
A: Yes, yes.  
Q: And how did you find out
 what happened to him? 
A: We Œ we did not find out. He returned 
from that solitary, I 
think, where he was 
beaten severely til he lost his mind. And 
I remember th ere was a psychiatrist among 
the inmates, and he talked to him, and he 
shrugged his shoulders,
 and he said, there™s 
nothing I can do for him here. And he went out one day and he never came back. 

And we never found out wh
at happened to him. 
Q: What happened. And how di
d you find out that he had been  beaten? I mean, did 
you meet people who had be
en in that other camp? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And do you Œ do you know th
e name of that other camp? 
A: No. 

Q: Was it ir Œ 
Irkutsk
? 
A: No, 
Irkutsk Œ Irkutsk
 was when my Œ where my gr
andfather from my mother™s 
side was, in the place called 
Bodaib o
,
 b-o-d-a-i-b-o
, which, believe it or not, I heard 
about again a few days ago, because a 
woman who was not a Polish Jew, and who 
was brought to this country with her son,
 who is a professor of mathematics at

Brown
 University, and who calls me beca
use she speaks no English, and had 
nobody to talk to. Sh
e said that she lived not too fa
r from where the deportees lived. 
And the Œ she knew that the deportees from 
Poland
 lived in this camp, not too far 
away from them, but she could do nothing 
for them, and she h
eard that ultimately 
they were allo Œ allo
wed to go back to 
Poland
 after World War II. And she was 
asking me whether there is any way to find
 a woman who was her friend. And I said, 
I don™t know of any. 
Q: Right. So  you have no id ea Œ 
Ephra im 
was not in the same camp Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ as Œ as the grandfather. 
A: No, grandfather was several t h ousand miles to the e ast.  
Q: I see. So he was closer to your camp Œ 

A: That™s correct. 

Q: Œ as Œ I see. But Œ and where was 
Aaron
, who was the younger brother, was he 
with your grandfather? 

A: He was with my grandfather. 

Q: I see. I g u ess I was under the impression that Œ that 
Ephraim
 was with him, but 
that™s not the case. 

A: No.

Ephraim
 when you were in sv Œ in 
Sverdlovsk

A: Yes. 
Q: You did? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What did you do in 
Sverdlovsk
? 
A: My Œ 
Q: Did you work ? 
A: No, I did not. I attended school. 

Q: You did? 
A: Yes, it was a school with one teacher, 
and children under, I think 12 or 14 were 
allowed to attend school. So I was in that school and so was my  kid brother, and I 
reme mb er I was worried about my kid brothe
r getting us all into trouble, because he 
got Œ he got a primer which had 
on page one, the portraits of 
Lenin™s
 wife, 
Krupskaya
. And since he found the cl
asses boring,he adorned 
Krupskaya
 with a 
moustache and a few other parts of mascu
line rather than feminine Œ masculine 
rather than Œ than femini
ne appearance. And I was sure that this little notebook 
would be requisitioned and then
 they™ll start to figure out
 who must have put him up 
to it. Well Œ 
Q: And that would have been you?

A: And that would have been me. 
Q: I see. 

A: I didn™t do it, and th
ey didn™t look for it. 
Q: What was the school like? 

A: The school was a little hut with wa Œ 
with two rooms. The lower room was the 

one that I went with , and my  brother, a
nd the other room was for somewhat older 
kids. 
Q: And was this a very ideological school? Was it communist? 
A: Oh yes, of course. 

Q: Yes. So did yo
u Œ would Œ were 
you taught about 
Lenin

 Marx

Q: Did you hate it? Or di

Q: Boring? 

A: Yes.

presented in a boring way.

A: Yes, they taught Œ th ey taugh
t arithmetic and I think geography. 
Q: Arithmetic and geography and nothing else? 
A: Noth ing else. 
Q: Hm. And did you have homework? 
A: Yes. You know, we Œ we had say four
 pages of mathematical problems, asking 
for the results. 

Q: Uh-huh. And when you we
re living in the barracks, 
was it a little bit like a small 
apartment, or was it not like that? 

A: It was a little bit like a small apartment. 

Q: And did you have an inside ba
throom, or an outside bathroom? 
A: Nobody had an  inside bathroom. 

Q: Mm-hm. So there was an
 outhouse in the back. 
A: Right. 

Q: Yes. And was there some running water in
side the apartment, or not even th at? 
A: No, not even that. 

Q: So where did you get wa
ter from? Was there a well? 
A: No, I think there was a spigot outside. 
Q: Do you™d have to bring in th e water. 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: Mm-hm. And your Œ your mo th
er didn™t work , or she did?

A: She did. 
Q: And do you rememb
er what she did? 
A: She did, I think Œ she 
was peeling potatoes, which 
were then cooked and wh ich 
was the ma in source of nourishment. 

Q: And was there a common kitch Œ I mean, a cafeteria? 

A: No. 

Q: Is Œ no, you Œ you ate 
in Œ in your own barrack. 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: Barrack room. 

A: That™s correct. 
Q: So, wh-w hat would happen th en? The Œ 
some of the food wo
uld be rationed and 
given to each family, or what? 
A: Yes. 
[indecipherable]
. If there were three of you, you got three potatoes. 

Q: I see. So your daily ration was potatoes. 
A: Right. And Œ and a piece of bread. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And it Œ and it was there that malnutr
ition resulted in me getting the jaundice. 
Q: Can you explain what th
at was like? What is jaundice? 
A: Jaundice is a Œ an illness caused by mal
nutrition, and you Œ the sign i Œ of it is 
that the whites of your eyes turn ye
llow. Now the whites of
 my eyes turned 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
29
practically brown, because I did not have th
e kind of food or medication that you use 
to treat jaundice. And for entertainment I 
will go outside the barracks because a few 
people there were to dig a grave fo r me
. And so they would try and do it on the 
warmer days. You know, they  would start th
e fire, and then the soil that was under 
the fire was warm enough fo r digging. Well,
 they never got around to burying me. I 
managed so mehow to escape death, but the re
sult of the jaundice is something that Œ 
that I had for years and years later, because 
the art Œ the jaundice that was not cured, 
resulted in problems with my Œ what is Œ 
what is the Œ wi-with-with ma Œ problems 
with Œ with my li-liver, and th-the othe
r thing which Œ gall bladder. So there was 
enough of damage done Œ done
 to those two things so that years later I was 
exempted from military serv
ice, because of problems with liver and with gall 
bladder which require a speci
al diet and medication. 
Q: I see. A nd what was the effect, besides 
the Œ the physical effect of your Œ your Œ 
the whites of your ey es going brown, wh at 
was the effect of the jaundice on you? Do  
you remember? 
A: Yes, it was Œ it Œ it Œ it gave me inte
rmittent gall Œ gall bladder and Œ and liver 
fever. And that was it. And the assump tion wa
s that if you didn™t take care of that 
with medication and prope
r diet, you would die. 
Q: Right. But you didn™t.  

A: But I didn™t.

Q: So you went outside to watch th
ese people digging a grave for you? 
A: Right. 
Q: Then wa Œ wh at did you say to th em? 
A: Noth ing. 
Q: Noth ing. You just watched them. 

A: I just watched them. 

Q: I see. 
A: And I remember Œ and I remember in th
e first few days after the Nazis entered 
Jaroslaw
, 
Hitler
 came to see how 
Jaroslaw
 under the Nazis managed to live. And 
the Œ and orders went out 
that on such and such a da
te, under the penalty of 
execution, nobody was to be close to a wi
ndow. And Œ but I Œ but I was not going to 
obey this order, because there was an im
portant thing for me to ascertain. The 
important thing was that when the Nazis s-scream 
heil H itler
, whether 
Hitler
 will 
scream 
heil ich
. And 
Hitler 
did not scream 
heil ich
,
 
he replied 
heil sieg
, you know. 
Long Œ long live victory. And that was it,
 an d nobody caught me
, so I did not face 
penalty of death. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And we were in that camp on the border of 
Siberia
, in the 
Urals
 until a few days 
after the attack of 
Germ any
 on the 
Soviet Union, 
which was June 22, 1941. And 
overn ight, they decided that 
we should no longer be co
nfined to camps, but we 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

31
should be allowed to 
live outside of camps, except on
ly for specific large cities and 
military objects. And so they 
told us to get the hell out of the camp. And since we 
were all freezing in those camps, the decisi
on that was made immediately was that 
whatever it is, we shall try and escape 
Siberia
, the 
Urals
 and go to  a warmer 
climate. And I rememb er somebody got a map, and on this map we circled those 
town s where we wanted  to go. And one of those town s was 
Jambol
. 
Jambol
 which 
right now has reverted to its pre-revolutionary name, 
Taras
. 
Jambol
 himself was a Œ 
was a folk singer specializing in obsequious odes to 
Stalin
 and all his henchmen. 
Now, the name of Œ of 
Taras
 is the one that you may ha
ve heard the last few days 
here, because it was th e name of the Œ of the 
[indecipherable]
 wh o lived Œ who 
lived on the other side of
 the frontier between the 
U.S.S.R
 and 
China
, where they 
still live. 

Q: Right. Let me go back to 
Sv erdlo v sk
 for Œ for a minute. Was it co ld all the time? 
A: Not all the time, but a lot of the time. 
Q: A lot of the time. A
nd did you have proper cl
othing, or you didn™t Œ 
A: No. 
Q: You didn™t. 
A: No, we didn™t. 
Q: So it was extremely  uncomfortable.

Q: Was it very snowy and icy? 
A: No. The snow on
ce fell, and stayed. 
Q: That was it. 
A: That was it. I saw this after the collaps
e of the Soviet regime, when I went to 
Omsk
 in 
Siberia
. We stayed in a hotel, and th-the
re was steady Œ there was snow the 
height of Œ of five foot 
eight, five foot nine, and no
body ever tried to clean it. 
Q: Really? 

A: Right. 
Q: And did you have that 
same kind of situation Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ wh en you were Œ 
when you were there? 
A: Yes. 
Q: So how did you get 
out of th e barracks?  
A: Because they would dig up a Œ enough 
snow so that you c
ould go out one by one. 
Q: So you could go out
 in line, sort of. 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: Was this a bad time for you in 
Sverdlovsk
, that you remember? 
A: Yes, it was a bad time because we were 
all starving. And also because we didn™t 
know what the charges are against us, or ho
w long we™ll Œ we be th ere. But we were 
lucky because the war all of a sudden made us into allies.

Q: Right. 
A: And we were allowed to go to 
Jambol
. 
Q: Right. Were you Œ when it Œ when you were in 
Sverdlovsk
, did you get any 
communication from relatives in 
Poland
? Do you remember? 
A: We got a few postcards, which we
re sent from German occupied  
Poland
, but not 
very much. 

Q: So you didn™t know very 
mu ch  about what was going on? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you hear rumors, do 
you remember, as a kid? 
A: We heard rumors, but we were not su
re whether the rumors are co rrect. One 
rumor that reached
 us was that 
Trotsky
 was assassinate d  in 
Mexico
, because the 
Soviets were afraid that 
Trotsky
 may offer some valuable assistance to the 
Germans, and they really expect
ed the Germans to attack the 
Soviet Unio n
. 
Q: They did? 
A: Yes, even though Œ even
 though the official line wa
s that the Germans are our Œ 
are our allies. 
Q: But what you know from history is that 
Stalin 
was Œ was Œ seemed not to be 
wanting to hear this. 

A: That™s correct. 

Q: So that Œ because the army wa
s not really Œ were not prepared.

A: He had Œ he had just

Q: Did anyone else in the family get ja
undice, do you know other people that got 
jaundice, wer Œ wer Œ or did y
ou th ink you were the only one? 
A: I thought I was the only one. But I neve
r heard of anybody else getting jaundice. 
Q: You didn™t. But that™s a t
ypical disease from starvation. 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: And a lot of people were not eating well. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: So it is a little surprising 
that you™re the only one. 
A: It is. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But maybe I wasn™t

Q: That™s Œ 

A: May Œ maybe there were a few Œ

A: Œ you know, two or three doors in the other direction.

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ they  Œ they also didn™t get it Œ 

A: That™s correct. 
Q: Œ from the Œ from the food that they were eating. 
A: Right, that™s right. 

Q: Did you lose a lot of weight? 

A: Oh yes, I lost a lot of weight. 
Q: Uh-huh. Were you very tired 
from Œ from not eating so mu ch? 
A: Yes. 
Q: So you weren™t growing ve

A: No, I was not. 

Q: Yeah. When  Œ who took out the maps? 
I mean, where did they get maps fro m? 
A: I think th ey got the maps from some dr
ivers of Œ of lorries, who had the maps. I 
don™t think they got the ma
ps, I think they were Œ 
Q: They were borrowed. 

A: They were borrowed. 

Q: I see. And th e decision to go south Œ a
nd a lot of people went south, I gather. 
A: Right. 

Q: Now how did you go to  ja Œ

? 
A: By cattle cars, the same way as we arrived in

.

A: I don™t think we had to pay for thes
e, because we didn™t have any money. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But they just gave us a certificate sayi
ng that so and so was released from this and 
this camp by the authorities in

the decision of the council of ministers on such and such  a date. 
Q: Right. And th e rush Œ the

A: Well, they did care, but we co uldn™t 
go west, because that™s where the Nazis 
were.

A: So we went Œ so we went from where they

 Siberian railroad, 
which went only one way.

Q: Right. So  did Œ did a lot of people go to

 from this camp?

A: It™s very long. 

Q: Here, let me get you Œ here. 
A: Thank you. 
Q: Sure. Here. There we go. 

A: Thank you. 
Q: You™re welcome. 
A: And in 
Jambol
 you also have other deportees 
from other places, quite a few from 
the 
Caucasus
, where the Germans were advancin
g and the Soviets were deporting 
native s-speakers of languages of the 
Caucasus
, because they were
 sure that they 
would greet the arrival of the Germans with
 joy. And so they 
dumped them in the 
same 
Jambol
. 
Q: So it™s a big mixture of people. 
A: Yes. 
Q: A lot of Jewish deportees from

know, we would Œ we would ex change
 a watch for a loaf of bread. 
Q: Uh-huh. Was this as Œ how long a tr
ip, do you remember? Was mo re than two 
weeks? 
A: No, ab out two weeks. 

Q: Again? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Now, was this the same kind of cattle 
car, were there no seats, and everybody™s 
standing or sitting on the floor? 
A: That™s correct, that™s correct, except th
at this time there were no Œ there were Œ 
there were no guards with
 rifles on the ready. 
Q: So you weren™t frighten ed in th e same way? 
A: No, because we were told 
that we are now free, wherea
s the first time they didn™t 
tell us if we are free Œ 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Œ and we were Œ we were guard ed by po
 Œ by police. And this time there weren™t

south, or you didn™t think about it?

Q: Uh-huh. So in so me ways you were
 going south in ignorance, you Œ you Œ 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: You knew it would be warmer. 

A: Yes, and that if you are Œ if you Œ if
 warmer, there Œ there

Q: Do you reme mb er the country side that 
you saw on the way on the train, or do Œ 
were Œ or were there no windows, or where 
there™s a little slat in the cattle car? 
A: I remember some, but not much. 
Q: Uh-huh, so you didn™t look much? 

A: No. 

Q: And you were pretty shor
t. It would have been toug
h to get up there, I would 
suspect. 

A: That™s correct, that™s correct. 

Q: So when you arrive in 
Jambol
, what Œ what is it like? 
You get off the train, what 
happens? 

A: And you look for a place 
to live. And so  one place that was very popular was 
called 
Torg sin
, spelled 
t-o-r-g-s-i-n
, which is an abrogation of trading with 
foreigners. It was a Soviet institution that 
would exchange valuab
les that foreigners 
may have had, for things th
at you couldn™t otherwise get,
 such as food, such  as 
clothing. And so  there was a flourishing bl
ack market of people trying to  get those 
things that they could excha
nge later for food or black market. Did I make it clear? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And th Œ that™s one thing,
 and the other thing was finding
 quickly a place to sleep, 
to Œ you know, you Œ we Œ we
 arrived there in the fall, which was not very cold, and 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

we were looking for a place to sleep. And 
of course, the locals, who could Œ who 
could provide a place to sleep 
wanted to get paid in eith
er gold or valuables that 
could be exchanged. And so  we foun
d one place to sleep with a local 
Kaza kh 
who 
had Œ who was starving. And I 
rememb er he was starving, 
but so was his dog, and he 
didn™t have anything to give to the dog, and the d
og ultimately died of hunger. And 
we lived in an extra room 
that he had in his house, 
for a while. And the way Œ and 
the way we lived is that my
 Œ my  father would get so
mebody who would give him 
things that you can exchange 
for food or Œ or other necess
ities. And I went to school. 
There was a normal Russian school there, wh
ich was run by the Siberian railroad Œ si

and ag ain I was starved. But you had to go
 to that school because there was nothing 
else for me to do. Occasionally I would he

those things that he thought would be 
very dangerous if found on his person. 
Q: Like what? 
A: Like golden co ins from pre-Soviet era, or
 golden  wedding rings and sa Œ and such 
things.

 get those things from? 
A: From people who wanted to be paid in

43
Q: Yeah. Were you at home a lot because of 
the pain, so you couldn™t go to school, 
or did you go in  spite of the pain? 

A: I went in spite of the pain. 
Q: And was school a little bit more interestin g here, or not? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Why? 

A: Because you had teachers who were prof
essional teachers, and there was a w ider 
variety of Œ of subject matter, and also 
there was Œ the school had a library, so I 
could get some books from th
e library and then exchange them for other books. 
Q: I see. And did you talk
 about school wh en you came home and talked to your 
parents, or no Œ or not? 
A: No. 

Q: You didn™t. 

A: No. 
Q: So, were you mu ch mo re interested in
 school than  in some ways your parents 
were? Were you very different from the family? 
A: No, not really. Well, they 
didn™t expect the school to be
 of any in terest to them. 
Q: I see. So did you still eat breakfast and 
dinner with your Œ 
your parents, or Œ 
A: No, I ate Œ I ate not breakfast and di

A: No. 
Q: But you do know people who did. 

A: Yes. 
Q: And did 
Simon
, your brother? 
A: No.
 
Q: So you were Œ you

A: That™s correct. 
Q: Was there anti-Semitism that you remember in 
Jambol
? 
A: Oh, yes. 
Q: There were. 
A: Violent anti-Semitism. 

Q: What does that mean? 

A: Well, it means that they 
would beat up people they 
thought were Jewish. They 
will say that we will not rent any living quar
ters to Jews. If Jews offer something for 
exchange, it means they are goi
ng to cheat you. Jews don™t get drafted into th e army , 
which was not true. Things like that. 
Q: So was this dangerous for 
you to walk on the streets 
and go to school? Were you 
beaten up? 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
47
Q: You were. Did you fight back ? 
A: Not much, because it was always a few of them and me alone. 

Q: I see. So when  you were walking to
 school, you were not necessarily walking 
with a group of Œ of people, 
you were walking by yourself. 

A: No. That™s right. 

Q: So what did this make you feel like 
as a kid? Did you Œ did you think it was a 
terrible thing to be Jewish, or you Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: You did. 

A: That™s right. 
Q: And did you say anything to
 your parents about this? 
A: Was of no use. 
Q: Because there was not
hing they could do? 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: So, were you attending synagogue? 
A: There was no synagogue. 

Q: But you were Bar Mitzvahed in 
Jambol
, is that correct? 
A: Yes, but it was not a synagogue. It si
mp ly  Œ  we simp ly  go
t together in the 
quarters of a pious Jew, brought a loaf of 
bread and a bottle of 
vodka, and he had a 
Torah, and that was it. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

48
Q: That™s the Bar Mitzvah? 
A: That™s the Bar Mitzvah. 

Q: Did you drink vodka? 
A: I did not. 
Q: So what did you think of this, if you th
ought it was a terrible thing to be Jewish in 
a way Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ because you were being beaten up
, wh at did you think ab out being Bar 
Mitzvahed? Was this a good th
ing, in fa Œ in your ey es? 
A: That was a good thing because it was th
e thing to do if you were Jewish. And 
since being Jewish was not a matter of choice, you may as well do it. 
Q: So you didn™t have a
ny questions about doing it? 

A: No. 

Q: Right. And did your br
other get bat Œ Bar Mitzvahe
d in this period of time? 
A: No. 

Q: Oh, he wasn™t old enough. 

A: No. 
Q: I guess in 1945 he would have been 13. 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: So did you go to scho
ol thro ughout the period Œ 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
49
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ until 1945? 

A: The last year and a half, th
ey organized a Polish school in 
Jambol
. 
Q: Really? 

A: Right. And th e Po lish school was allowed to receive some support from 

[indecipherable]
 in the form of Œ of grits or Œ or some other thing that they could 
cook, and they could give you a portion of
 it for lunch. And in this respect it w as 
better to be a student in the Po lish school
 than  in the state Russian school. The 
Russian school did not enjoy any special 
privileges and the Po lish school did. And 
also the Polish school was about 90 pe
rcent Jewish. So, yo
u know, you did not 
expect to be mistreated for being a Jew. 

Q: Right. So , who started this school? 

A: The Polish school? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: The union of Po lis
h patriots, then in 
Mo sco w
, which was the Œ which was the 
original name of the communi
st Polish government that wa
s being there organized in 
Moscow
.  
Q: So the Œ you still had classes ab out communism and 
Lenin
? 
A: But not Œ 
but not much. 
Q: Not much . 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
50
A: No. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I mean, you know, the Œ th
e classes about communism and 
Lenin 
were replaced 
by classes that tried to teach you Polish. 

Q: Were you speaking Polish? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So you were getting 
advanced Polish or Œ 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: Œ when you read Œ were yo
u reading Polish literature then? 
A: Yes. 
Q: I see. So did you like that school better? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And that Œ the kids who were in the 
school, they became friends of yours? 
A: Some of them did. 
Q: Uh-huh. And are Œ was it mainly the pe
ople who lived near Œ near you, were Œ 
were Œ you were friends with th
em, or what? Or not necessarily? 
A: I would say not necessary. 

Q: Uh-huh. So wh at did you do with 
other kids, when  you had friends in 
Jambol
? 
A: You exch anged books. Occasionally you 
could exch ange some edible thing. For 
instance, you could Œ you could buy at th
e marketplace dried fruit, like you could 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

exchange it for other dried 
food. But there wasn™t very
 mu ch that you could do. 
There are no Œ there were no activities that
 depended on you and that would be 
available to you, but not to others. 
Q: So you didn™t play games? 
A: No.  

Q: Or sports? 

A: Mm-mm. 
Q: So when you look back on it now, 
does it feel like a 
deprived childhood? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In comparison with what? With kids
 that you know now
, your grandkids? 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: Yeah. So  does that make you sad? 

A: No. 

Q: That™s just how it was? 
A: 
A guerre comme a la guerre
. It was war time. 
Q: Right. Were you getting any informati
on about what the N
azis were doing once 
they attacked 
Poland
? Because now they really 
are starting to kill Jews. 
A: That™s right. But Œ but th
ey would not Œ they  would not spread the news because 
they did not want to be accused of 
fighting for the sake of the Jews.  

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
52
Q: So th e Ru ssians would not Œ the
 Soviet Union
 would not say anything ab out wh at 
was going on? 
A: No. 
Q: Would Œ did Œ 
did you still get any communication from 
Poland
, from relatives? 
A: No, no. 
Q: No. So did you assume so
mething horrible had happened? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You Œ you as an indivi
dual, or you as a family? 
A: Me as a family. 
Q: And did you questi
on your parents and say wh at do
 you th ink is going on, or not? 
A: No. 

Q: You didn™t. 

A: Cause I knew that they c
ould not tell me anything that was not public knowledge. 
Q: You were a pretty prec
ocious kid, weren™t you? 
A: Yes, I was. 

Q: Was that a problem? 

A: No. But by th en we alrea
dy knew  that it™s a question of
 time before the Nazis are 
defeated. 

Q: Did you assume that they 
would be defeated quickly? 
A: Not quickly, but th
at they would ultim
ately be defeated. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
53
Q: Why did you think th at? 
A: Because they failed in their 
blitzkrieg
. They failed in their a
ttempt to defeat rush 
Œ 
Russia
 quickly, and since 
they did not defeat 
Russia
 quick ly, they  began to  have 
doubts about the ultimate defeat of 
Russia
. And so  Œ and then by the second part of 
the war, they already knew that the Germ
ans are beingpushed
 back, and wa Œ  
Q: So you Œ so you knew that? 

A: Yes. 
Q: You were in 
Jambol
 for a very long time. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Did you get used to it? 
A: Well, sort of. 
Q: But you Œ you and your fa
mily expected the war to be over so you could leave, I 
gather, right? 

A: That™s correct, that™s correct. 
Q: But you Œ you rema ined in
 school from ™41 to ™45, so you were there for four 
years? 
A: Right. 
Q: And did you go from class to class so 
that your Œ your cl
asse s bec ame more 
complex, or what? 
A: Went from class to class.

protective of him, do you remember? 
A: My brother died some years ago. 
Q: But when  you were in 
Jambol
, he was Œ 
Simon
 was Œ was there with you, right? 
A: Right. 
Q: So were you protective of him in 
Jambol
? 
A: No, not really. Not really. 
Q: So you weren™t very  close to him?  
A: No, not really. 

Q: Is that partly because he was younger? 
A: I think so . 
Q: Mm-hm. Were there a lot of bugs wh ere 
you were living? Did 
you have to  fight 
off bedbugs and things? 

A: Yes, but not that many. I mean, not unusually many. 
Q: Were you stateless? 
A: When ? 

Q: In 
Jambol
. 
A: In 
Jambol
 we were stateless because they
 no longer recogn
ized the Polish 
government in 
London
, and th e govern ment in 
Moscow
 was not yet formed.

A: Yes. 

Q: So ev en thou
gh you™re stateless, you Œ you ar
e being contro lled in some way by 
the Russians. 
A: Definitely. 
Q: Did you think ab out Œ did your family 
Œ you were Œ you were 
too young, but di Œ 
did your family think about leaving 
Jambol
 before the end of the war? Did you Œ 
A: No, because there was nowhere to
 go before the end of the war. 
Q: So you certainly were
 not going to  go west. 
A: Well, th Œ you couldn™t go west 
because the Germans were still there. 

Q: Right. And Œ 
A: Once the Germans began to l
eave what was previously the 
Soviet Union
, we 
began to think of going back 
to the liberated territories. 
Q: Mm-hm. But that™s alrea
dy towards the end of the war.

Q: Right. What did you know about 
Ander™s 
Army?

A: 
Ander™s
 Army was a Polish army that was organized in the 
Soviet Union
, and 
many Jews tried to join the army, but they
 were not accepted 
by the Poles, they 
didn™t want this to be a Jewish army. 
Q: So only some
 Jews got in. 
A: Only some Jews got in. 
Q: Did your father want to 
go into that army or not? 
A: No. 
Q: No, he didn™t. So  he Œ he was going to stay out no matter what.

A: No, no. 
Q: Œ in 
Jambol
? You stayed in that Œ in that Œ in
 that place of that guy who had the 
dog? Or had you Œ 
A: No, we Œ we moved to another place, 
which was closer to the Polish school, and 
closer to the bazaar where 
you could look for food. 
Q: And was that a bigger place? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

57
A: It was a somewhat bigger place. 
Q: But again, no running water. 

A: No ru nning water.

A: Classical Russian literature, translations
 of western literature. Modern literature.

Jambol
. 
Q: In 
Jambol
. There™s a lot of closeness between the Russian language and the 
Polish language in a certain way. 
A: Well, they™re Œ they are both Slavic lang
uage. They are as Œ as close as French 
and Italian. 

Q: Which isn™t that close. 
A: Which isn™t that close, all right. 
Q: Right. Bu t you Œ you had an 
Œ a fairly easy time as a kid Œ

A: There is a language called 
Kazakh
, which is close to Turk
ish. And th ey taught 
Kaza kh
 in the Russian school, but they 
didn™t take it seriously , just as 
Kaza kh
 
independence was not treated seriously
. I still remember one poem, of 
Jambol
 
[indecipherable]
, which went as follows 
[spea ks fo reig n la ng uag e here]
. 
Q: Can you translate th at, sort of? 
A: Sort of, that we Œ we sing the praises 
of our soldiers who are the defender Œ th e 
defenders of our nation. And wh ile we sing th
eir praises,  we also sing the praises of 
the great Russian nation. That™s it. 

Q: That™s it. And you learned this in school? 

A: I learned this in school. 
Q: Does this Œ y-you™re smiling. Is it surpri
se you that this is 
the one poem that you 
reme mb er?

that I remember any poem.

A: Like 
Tolsto y

A: But there was nothing unusual about that. 
I would say that mo st Œ mo st kids read 
the same b o oks. We read whatever books were allowed to be given to us by the 
library. 
Q: Because reading was really the 
primary occupation that you could Œ 
A: That™s correct.

d somebody who sent us Œ some distant 
cousin of mine who sent us a re
quest to join him in the Polish

Poland
, and on the basis of that, we got ra
ilroad tickets and we
 went in that 
direction. And we
 got as far as 
Lvov
 or 
Lviv
, and then we cross 
into Polish territory. 
Q: And did you end up in 
Kraków
? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And what was 
Kraków 
like then? 
A: Well, 
Kraków 
was the one town th at was not de
stroyed by th e war. It was pretty 
much like the pre-war 
Kraków
, except that there were hard
ly any Jews in it. Before 
the war, 
Kraków
 was about half Jewish. 
Q: Right. And did you find 
out when you crossed into 
Poland 
wh at had happened to 
Jews, I mean in terms of th
e murdered Jews, or what? 
A: We found it out when we arrived in 
Kraków
, but later on we wo
uld get mo re and 
more details on how it worked, and where. 

Q: And Œ and y
ou believed it? 
A: Well, if you didn™t believe it, all you 
had to  do was find a cab, which will take 
you to 
Auschwitz
, which was about two h
ours™ drive from there. 
Q: Were people go
ing and visiting 
Auschwitz
 then? 
A: Yes. 
Q: They were? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you go? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
65
A: Yes. 
Q: What was that like? 

A: That was Œ 
Q: Which was in ™45? 
A: In ™45. It was Œ it was a frightening expe
rience, but by then we couldn™t say that 
we didn™t know about it, b
ecause by then Œ by th
en they had many trials of Nazis 
who were caught, you know, a
nd Œ and the trials very of
ten were translated into 
radio. So  could you 
Œ you could hear it. 

Q: Did you go with your fa
mily when you went to 
Auschwit z
, did you go with other 
kids, wh at Œ 
A: No, I went with other kids. 
Q: And was this a school thing that Œ 

A: No, no, it was a Œ it was by then  a Jewish
 kids. There were Jewish kids who were 
returning from 
Russia
, or Jewish kids who lived through the Ho locaust in 
Poland
 
an d  su rv iv ed . 

Q: And so you decided you w
ould Œ you would join  them? 
A: Yes.  
Q: So Œ so th is was a Œ 
a kind of private decision. 
A: That™s correct. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
66
Q: So tell me what that was like, for you 
to walk through this. 
Did Œ was Œ was there 
a Œ a kind of tour, was there anybody gu
iding you, or you just walk through? 
A: We had somebody guiding us, but
 I don™t remember who it was. 
Q: And did you go to 
Birkenau
, or you went to Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: So you went Œ 

A: We also went to 
Birkenau
. 
Q: Uh-huh. So you went to 
Auschwit z
 one and then 
Auschwitz
 two? 
A: That™s correct.  

Q: And what was it like then? In ™45? That™s
 much earlier than mo
st people ever saw  
it. 

A: That™s correct. Well, you knew that yo
u were where the horrible things were 
happening. And this was in this barrack, a
nd the other thing was 
in another barrack. 
And it was difficult to believe then that 
time would co me, and there would be people 
deno Œ denying the Holocaust all togeth er. 

Q: Right. So  you Œ when you went back to  
Kraków
, did you th en tell your parents 
what you saw? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And did they go as well? 

A: Ye-Yes they did Œ 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

67
Q: They did. 
A: Œ but they went separately. 

Q: Uh-huh. And did they go be
cause you had gone, you think? 
A: No. 

Q: No. And when  they 
came back, did you then
 discuss it with them? 
A: There was nothing to  discuss. 

Q: When  did you find out what had happened with the family? 
A: Within a few weeks. 
Q: Of coming to  
Kraków
. 
A: Right. 
Q: And did Œ did 
Aa ron
 find you in  
Kraków
? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And how did he do that? I mean
, how come he went to Œ was 
Kraków 
a place 
that a lot of people went after
 Lvov
? 
A: Yes. But also Œ but also, 
Kraków 
was the place where you could get information 
about other people who got back  and wh
ere did they go. You know, for example 

there were a few people who were direc
tly to the former German cities in 
Silesia
, but 
you would find out 
about them in 
Krakow
, and th ey would know who went where. 
You had, in 
Kraków
, unlike in the 
Soviet Union
, you immediately had Jewish 
organizations, and th ose organizations would 
try to provide as mu ch info rmation as

possible, about the whereabouts of surviv
ors, or liquidations of earlier ghettoes, 
when and where and how, and 
so forth, which you did not 
have in Russian occupied 
Poland
. 
Q: I see. 
A: In 
Kraków
, you had a functioning synagogues. 
Q: So did th ey Œ did they
 have lists up on walls Œ 

A: Lots of them. But, you know, people 
would look at those lis
ts and also append 
their own queries about the whereabouts of 
their families, and who went where, and 
who is likely to have been in this or in
 that ghetto, or who is likely to have 
information about the fate of individual persons. 
Q: You s Œ you spoke abou
t anti-Semitism in Œ in 
Za m b o r
(ph). 
A: Right, in 
Jambol
. 
Q: 
Jambol
 rather, in 
Kaza khstan
. When  you came back to 
Poland
, was there also a 
lot of anti-Semitism? 

A: Oh yes. Quite a lot. 
Q: And how did that mani
fest itself for you? 
A: Well, there would be Jews who were take
n off trains and killed 
on the spot in po 
Œ in 1945 Œ ™46 in 
Poland
. There were Jews who were wa
rned not to co
me to this 
place or to that place because they™ll Œ th
ey™ll be murdered, and quite a few were. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
69
But it was Œ it was not very different from anti-Semitism that you might have before 
the war. 

Q: So it wasn™t necessarily wors
e than it was after the Nazis. 
A: No. 

Q: It was the s Œ it was the same kind of Œ 

A: It was the same kind, except that 
Œ except that the 1
945, the postwar anti-
Semitism was made more acceptable because th
e war taught the Poles that to Œ that 
you may kill Jews with impunity. 

Q: You™re now 16 at the end of the war, right? 

A: That™s right. 
Q: When  you go back to 
Kraków
, do you go to school? 
A: Yes, I did. I went to one school in 
particular, which before the war was about 
one-third Jewish. After the war there were
 t-two of us in th
at school who were 
Jewish. 

Q: Was there any sympathy at all Œ 
A: No, none. 

Q: None, about wh at had happened? 
A: That™s right. 
Q: And do you explain that 
because everybody was suffering from the war itsel f, or 

Œ 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
70
A: No. 
Q: How Œ 

A: No, I think that it was so because by 
then the propaganda 
of the anti-Soviet 
groups spread the wo rd that the new pro-
Soviet govern ment is really a Jewish 

government. 

Q: And why do you think they  did that? 

A: To undermine that government. 
Q: So it was an easy way to undermine th
e government by saying it was Jewish? 
A: Correct. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you have a weapon th at you 
carried around with  you at that ti Œ at 
that point? 
A: Yes. Yes, I did, because the police woul
d occasionally close its eyes to the fact 
that the Jews had weapons, 
because they could not provid
e them with protection 24 
hours a day. So they would sa
y, if you have a gun, we 
will not kill you for it. You 
know, and Œ and you could fi
nd guns all over the place. 
Q: You could? 

A: That™s right. 
Q: Is that how you got a gu
n, you fi Œ you found it? 
A: Yes, right. 
Q: And was this a small pistol, or what? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
71
A: No, it was a normal pistol. 
Q: Uh-huh. And you carried it in your pock et? 

A: I carried it under my  belt. 
Q: And did you go to sc
hool with this weapon? 
A: That™s correct. 

Q: And the teacher didn™t say anything
 and the students di
dn™t say anything. 
A: Nobody said anything. 
Q: Were they frightened
 of you, you think? 
A: I don™t think so. 
Q: And where did you get bullets? 
A: Again, you could find th em on the black market. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you Œ did your
 parents know that you had the gun? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And th-th-they were fine with this? 

A: Right. 
Q: Did th ey have one as well? 
A: No. But that™s the pl
ace where the pogroms began.
 You know, there was one 
pogrom that never took place, because we we
re told that there wo
uld be one. And so 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

we organized a defense orga
nization. And I rememb er th
at before Passover 1946, I 
went out of the house where the Jews lived
, and I saw a carton with something in it. 
So I walked over to it to see what it is. And I saw a 
newborn child cut into little 
pieces in that car-carton. And I took the cart
on away with a couple
 of other kids, and 
we hid it. And within minutes, there was 
a large group of local people looking fo r 
something. They  were obviously lo oking fo r 
that carton, but finding none, they  went 
back and disappeared. And th
is was the Œ the pogrom that never was realized in 
Kraków
. Bu t an-another gos Œ pogrom in 
Kielce
 did take place, and there were 
about 70 or 80 Jews who we
re killed in that pogrom. 
And there Œ there was Œ and 
that Œ there was a press conference in the 
Œ with Œ with th e Œ with  the archbishop of 
Kraków
, and I went to that press conference a nd I heard one journalis
t ask, is it true 
that the Jews use Christian blood to ma
ke ma tzoh? And his eminence thought for a 
minute and he replied, I really don™t know. 
Q: I really don™t know? 
A: Right. 
Q: Was Œ was the fear of pogroms what made you and your fami ly leave Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ 
Poland
 all together? 
A: Yes, yes. The fear of pogroms, and the fear that 
Poland
 is going to  be a Soviet 
state. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
73
Q: And why did the second thi
ng frighten you, do you think? 
A: Because we didn™t want to be Œ to
 live in a country 
that would be like 
Jambol
. 
Q: Uh-huh. And was this discussed with
 your parents, or did they  just Œ 
A: No.  
Q: Œ say we™re going? 

A: They said we are going, they said, we
 don™t want to be the last Jews alive in
 
Poland
. 
Q: Mm-hm. Was it easy to leave? 

A: Yes, because the Polish government want
ed the Jews out, because they were a se 
Œ a security drain, and also because they 
knew that the Jews w
ill be an excuse for 
anti-Soviet, anti-communist activity. 

Q: What do you mean that the Jews were 
a security drain, what does that mean? 
A: That they would have to assign so 
many policemen to protect the places where 
the Jews lived. 
Q: So th ey were not unhappy th
at the Jews wanted to leave. 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: Did mo st Jews leave, you think? 
A: I would say yes. 
Q: Yeah.

A: This is where the refug
ee camps began to be organized in the American zone of 
occupation in 
Germany
. 
Q: Mm-hm. But you and your family did not go to 
Germany
, did you, you went to 
France
. 
A: No, we went to 
France
. 
Q: And how did that happen? 

A: Somebody to ld us that if you go to 
France
, you™ll find it easier to go to 
America
, 
if you have relatives in  
America
. 
Q: So in  1946 you go to  
Paris
? 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: And is that in Œ in the 
summer, or in Œ in th e end of
 March or something, do you 
know? 

A: The end of March. 

Q: It™s the end of March. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So it™s a little chilly in 
Paris
 at this point? 
A: Yes it is, but it™s not Œ but it™s not 
Siberia
. 
Q: Right. No w one Œ 
once you wer-were in 
Poland
, were you able to get more 
clothes? 

A: Yes.

Q: I mean, di Œ di Œ so 
you Œ wh en you went to 
France
, you had more things with 
you? 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: And was it easy to get a place to stay? 
A: In 
Paris
? 
Q: Yes. 

A: In 
Paris
 we were helped by the American 
Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They assigned us to hotel rooms, and 
they provided us with one meal a day. 
Q: And was that the big meal, or the smallest one? 
A: It was Œ it was a big meal. 
Q: Yes. And there must have been a lot of refu-refugees, I mean. 

A: Oh yes. And it was in 
Paris
 that Œ that I learned how to speak Yiddish  properly. 
Q: Why? 
A: Because there were Jews from all over 
Europe
, refugees, and Hungarian Jews 
did not understand Polish, and neith
er did Romanian Jews. But the 
lingua franca
 for 
all of them was Yiddish. 

Q: I see. So who taught you Yiddish ? 
A: Some Jews from those countries. 

Q: So you became fluent in Yiddish. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg

A: So I became flue
nt in Yiddish. 
Q: So now you™re s-seventeen ye
ars old and you have Ru ssian Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ Polish Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ 
Ka za kh 
Œ 
A: Not quite, but some. 
Q: Some. And Yiddish . 
A: And Yiddish. 

Q: So we only have three or 
four languages to go, right? 
A: That™s right. 

Q: And you learned French? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So that™s the fifth one, so far. 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
Q: And what is it like in 
Paris
 right after the war? Is it Œ is it Œ  
A: Well, you Œ 
Q: Œ difficult situation, or Œ 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
77
A: It™s difficult, because you could not 
get a working permit, 
because the French 
suffered from unemp loyment. So th ey would 
allow Jews, refugees, to work only in 
three or four professions, where there 
was no unemployment. See what I mean? 
Q: Mm-hm, right. So Œ and that wasn™t 
a great number of spots, I would gather. 
A: That™s correct. But we were all 
waiting for the opportunity to leave 
France
 for 
the 
United States
 or 
Ca na da
. I mean, there was no state of 
Israel
 yet. 
Q: Right. Bu t did Œ woul
d you have gone if ther
e had been  a state of 
Israel
, you 
think? 
A: Maybe, I™m not sure, I™m not sure, but I think maybe. 

Q: But 
Aaron
, your Œ your mo ther™s brother, th
e only brother who™s alive, goes to 
Palestine, or goes to 
Israel
. Goes after? 
A: Goes Œ goes to 
Israel
. 
Q: So after the Œ the 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: After the proclamation. 
Q: Yes. 
A: After the proclamation of the Jewish state. 

Q: Right. So is your father working at
 all during those two years while you™re in 
Paris
? 
A: No. 

Q: He™s not? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
78
A: No, because there was no Œ there was 
no work where you could get a job where 
you were allowed to work. So
 we were just waiting for th
e opportunity to get the hell 
out of there. 
Q: So that™s difficult, it™s two years like this. 
A: Yes, I know. 

Q: Do you go to  school at all? 

A: Yes, I did. 
Q: You Œ you Œ so you™re 
continually going to  school 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: I am continually going to school. 
Q: Right. And what
 do you study in  
Paris
? 
A: French, French history. 
Whatever. Current events, thi
ngs like this. But again, it 
was not clearly defined, because th
e country was not back to normal. 
Q: Right. But it is interesting to know that 
in all of these situations, there is schools 
available for kids. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Even if it™s Œ they™re not the best. 

A: That™s correct. But Œ 
Q: So Œ 
A: But it was such schooling th at provided
 with some modicu m of continuity Œ 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
79
A: Œ with the pre-war situation. 
Q: So that™s very helpful. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Now did you know kids who were in 
school from previ Œ from other places? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Or are these totally new kids? 

A: Both. 
Q: Both. Are some of them your friends? 
A: Yes. 

Q: So is there more to do in 
Paris
 for you as a chi Œ as a seven Œ you™re not a ch ild 
any more really, but I mean, you™re a teenager Œ 

A: Mm-hm. Yes. 

Q: Œ you™re 17 years old. Is there more to do, or is the situation so  bad because of the 

ravages of war? 
A: No, I think because of the 
first. But again, there wasno clear line of demarcation 
between the two. And there were always ru
mors, you know, that within a week, they 
will allow Jews to leave for, say 
Venezu ela
. Which th ey did. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
80
A: Except that you were
 allowed to go to 
Venezu ela
, provided you lied about your 
religion, with the connivance of the Ven
ezuelan government, which allowed only 
white, Christian immigration. 
Q: But they knew that people were lying? 
A: They knew that people were lying, 
and Œ and th e train to where th e boats for 
Venezu ela 
were, were paid for and organized by the Jewish organizations from
 
America
. 
Q: Now when you get to 
Paris
, do you very quickly 
try to get visas? 
A: We did, but that was of no av ail, be
cause visas were usual Œ usually given to 

categories of people rather than individuals. 
Q: And what were the categories? 
A: The categories were those who lied abou
t their religion, and who lied about their 
economic status, or what they could contribute to 
Venezu ela
. 
Q: And Œ but you immediat
ely applied to go to the 
United States
, is that correct? 
A: We did, but they told us that this ta
kes ti me . So do you wa
nt to leave now for 
Venezu ela
 or await better luck with visa applications to 
America
? 
Q: Right. And you decided to wait. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. And you ha
d to wait two years. 
A: Mm-hm.

A: Yes, it is. 

Q: Yeah. And during this whole period of tim
e, the Jewish Joint is Œ is giving you

Beginn ing Tape Five 
Q: Dr. 
Friedberg
, where did you live in 
Paris
? 
A: We lived in two hotels that were prac
tically taken over by 
the American Jewish 
Joint Distribution Committee. One was on 
Rue de Roi de Sicile
, the street of the 
king of 
Sicily
, which was in a section known as 
Le Marais
, 
Metro
 
Saint-Paul
, 
between 
Bastille 
and Œ and the Œ and the 
Louvre
 and 
Rue Rivo li
. And then they 
moved all of us to 
Rue Gambai
(ph), which was almo st on 
Place de la Republique
, 
which was also taken over by th e Jewish orga
nization, which placed there its refugee 
clients. Seven 
Rue Gambai
(ph). 
Q: Tell me, do you Œ do you reme mb er whet
her your mo ther got really depressed 
after she found out what happened to the 
family, or weren™t you aw are of this? 
A: I was not aware of that. 

Q: So sh e didn™t talk about it much? 

A: No. 
Q: Did she talk about it later, or not? 
A: No. 

Q: She didn™t? 
A: No, she didn™t. 
Q: Uh-huh. Did your father lose family? 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
83
A: Oh, yes. Lots of family, but again, th
ere was no visible signs 
of depression on his 
part. But this was quite common, and one re ason was that the news of the slaughter 
of one™s family came at the 
same time as the news of th
e hora Œ restoration of the 
state of 
Isr a el
. So one would mo re or less eradic
ates the extreme impression of the 
others. 

Q: You Œ you don™t think th at the 
personal loss was greater than the Œ 
A: Euphoria? 
Q: Yeah, of Œ of 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I Œ I think it was, but one canceled out
 th e others. There was not enough of an 
intermission between the two. 

Q: Right. The 
Ma ra is
 district in 
Paris
 is mainly Jewish, isn™t it? 
A: Yes, it was mainly Jewish. 
Q: And that™s probably why the Join
t was there in the first place Œ  
A: Could be. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 first Œ 
A: And there were also 
some synagogues there.  
Q: Did you experience anti-
Semitism there as well? 

A: In 
France
? 
Q: Yes. 
A: No. 

 
Interview with Maurice Friedberg  
 
August 12, 2009 
 

 
 
84
Q: No? 
A: No. 

Q: So was this different for you to liv
e in a place where there was no overt anti-
Semitism? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And was this significant to you? 

A: Yes, it was. But then it was the Œ my fi
rst encounter with a n
on-Soviet state, you 
know, where the police did not ju
st round up and shoot people.  
Q: And that™s what you were used to Œ 

A: Right. 
Q: Œ in 
Kaza kh s Œ  
A: That™s right. I mean, for the first time,
 I Œ I met a state where the sight of a 

policeman did not immediately result in fe
ar of being arrested and Œ and Œ an d 
mistreated.  
Q: And do you th Œ was that tr
ue for most people in Œ in 
France
 at that time? 
A: I think so . 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And the French had a very
 big s Œ record in treating Jews during th e Nazi period.

A: Right.

96
Q: Right. 
A: And after a few years there, I moved to 
Indiana
 in 
Bloomingto n
 where I taught

I retired. 

Q: Uh-huh. And was that the best place that you remember? 

A: Yes, right. 

Q: Is that why you moved, 
because you thought it would 
be Œ each place would be a 
better place for you? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did you en Œ you en
joy doing the research and wr
iting your books more than 
you did the teaching, or Œ 

A: That™s correct.

A: That™s right. 
Q: You wanted something else. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Were any of your books mo re 
important to you than  any others?

Interview with Maurice Friedberg

97
Q: Right. Tell me something, 
wh-why do you think 
at this point in your life, you™re 
willing to sp eak about your experiences
 during the war, and 
you haven™t been 
willing to do that 
before, do you know? 
A: Well, the number of people willing to ta
lk about their wartime ex periences keeps 
dwindling. We ar
e dying off, one after another. And so 
I think that, if 
they feel about 
it the way I do, they will start 
speaking, before it™s too late. 
Q: And why do you think it™s important to do that? 
A: To preserve the historical record. 
Q: Mm-hm. Do you think people are not
 going to believe that the Holocaust 
h a pp en ed ? 
A: Well, there already are quite a few people who don™t believe. 
Q: Is it uncomfortable to talk about it, or Œ or not? 

A: Not uncomfortable, prov
ided  I speak to somebody like you. Bu t, you know, 
occasionally I get people who Œ who will 
tell me in effect, I understand that you 
were gang-raped. How interes
ting. Tell me all about it. 
Q: They say something like that to you? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Really. And do you Œ do 
you question them and say, 
where do you get such an 
idea from? 
A: No.

Q: No. What do you Œ what do you do? 
A: I just don™t talk to them. 

Q: I see. You know that your
 story is an unusual one? 
A: Why? 

Q: Because it Œ it appears that the people 
who have been emphasi
zed in doing oral 
histories, are not the people who went east, but who stayed. 

A: Yes, I know. 
Q: And who came under the Nazis, whichyou fortunately didn™t, even though you 
cle Œ you and your family clearly suffered. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: So it™s a Œ it™s a bit of different story, right? 
A: No, I agree, you™re right.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. Well, I want 
to thank you for being willing 
to speak with me, and the 
mu seu m. 
A: You™re very welcome. 
Q: We™re very grateful. Is there an ything mo
re that you would like to talk about that 
you haven™t Œ we haven™t talked about. 
A: No, thank you. 
Q: No? 

A: No.
