Q: Were you afraid of them? 
A: We were afraid of them, yes.  

Q: Did you have a 
Ba r Mitzvah

A: No, I did not have a 
Bar Mitzvah

Q: Wh-W hen did you leave 
Sanok

whoever -- what™s happened -- I™ll give you the 
[indecipherable] -- 
what™s 
happened , German took half of 
Poland
 and the Russians took
 the other half. So 
Sanok 
was actually on the border between th
e Russians and Germans. So the 
Germans told us one day, whoever wants,
 all the Jews, whoever wants to leave 
Sanok
 can go to the Russians. So
 we went to the Russian

42
A: No, we didn™t go -- maybe we g -- 
went -- go apartment. The apartment, 
somebody else lived already. 
Maybe we went back to  the apartment, didn™t think 
about it. But then I think it was we 
still couldfeel th
e anti-Semitism in 
Poland
, there 
were always anti-Semites in 
Poland
, even when -- bu

then we could -
- we heard that mostly Je

A: It was only two days when I came back
, but I -- I remind myself now the Polish 
people, I da -- wouldn™t say all of them, but
 a lot of them were anti-Semites. They 

didn™t -- they hate the Jews. 
Q: Did you have any particular experiences of that? 
A: No, I didn™t -- no, I didn™t have no partic

 Noyome
 from other places? 
A: They were from other places also. I do

, so wo -- we decided probably with my  
parents, all together to go to  that 
Noyome
 camp. 
Q: And so you stayed there a
nd you said you went to the 
ORT 
school? 
A: I went to 
ORT 
sch -- I went to 
ORT 
school. I picked up some trade which I don™t 
remember, I never used the trade, I don™t 
rememb er what was it. And I don™t think I 
finished that school because in ™48 they came from 
Isra el
 and they ask --
 Israe l 
became -- wa-wanted to be 
independent, and they ask 
if we want to go to 
Israel
, so I 
went.

were young?

ars old, pressured the young people to 
go to 
Israel
 
[indecipherable]
 to be soldiers.

Poland
 when you were 
a child? Were your 
parents Zionists when you were gr
owing up, when  you were a child? 
A: I don™t think so they were Zionists, I 
don™t think so. I never heard them talking 
about Zionism. May -- if they wo uld be Zionists they would leave 
Poland
, they 
would go to 
Palestine
 then. I don™t think they were Zionists. 
Q: So these people -- was this -- wha -- 
what -- wa -- w as this after the state of
 Israel 
was formed, in May 1948? 
A: No this -- I went to 
Israel -- 
I went to 
Israel 
before the state of 
Israel 
was born. 
Q: What were your parents reactions 
when  you said you wanted to  go? 
A: They -- in the beginning 
they didn't agree with -- they
 didn™t agree with it, but 
then was all kind of little pressure to go to 
Israel.
 And I saw a lot of young people 
are going, so I went with them. 

Q: And what were your though
ts about leaving your family? 
A: My -- I didn™t want to leave to -- my  family, but I was a -- probably by then a 
little Z-Zionistic inclined. 
Q: Did you speak Hebrew at that point?

the army, in th e Israeli army.

I think I left them in 
Russia. 
I think so .

camp, what was it like for you? Here it wa
s that it was the Germans who had waged 

the war, the Germans who had caused you a
ll these troubles, and now you™re in their 

country of 
Germany
. Was -- was that difficult for you to be in 
Germany

ote letters to me. And then they were in -- 
in 
No yo me

 In 1950 I guess

 Israel

Israel
 weren't too 
good. And fact is they wrote to me afte
