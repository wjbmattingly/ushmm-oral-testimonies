A: My wa -- my put -- my -- my family 
was religion -- our family was religion, a-
and my  father was a businessman, a [inde
cipherable] practical businessman, he 
build the houses. He was architect, built th
e houses [indeciphera
ble] the houses, it 
was his business. 

Q: So wha -- were you in 
a pretty well-off family? 
A: Middle class, but attend to th e pretty good gymnasium. The story was this way, 

my wi -- my father didn™t believe ther
e will be -- Poland will be free very long 
time, and he taught me that if I will be 
survive, I have to s-study in  the gymnasium 
will be the good s -- good language. It wa
s the to -- different schools it we -- I 

attend to the fi -- first -- first of all he 
ask me which language I prefer, Russian or 

German, because it was [indecipherable] 
I preferred German. Th-The reason I 
attend to the private s -- g-gymnasium Mi
koyrai, what was practically run by the 
evangeli -- og -- evangi -- no -- the li -- 
evangelism ch-church , you know? And 
mo st these people, the student would a
ttend was from the Ge
rman family, they 
speak home German. That what there is, on 
that I was a very poor student with the 
German. Every year I have a student,
 you know, wh ich teach me during the 
vacation. Usually my  parents with anothe
r parents, you know, hired the student 
from the Germany, and to -- during the two 
months we sent fo
r vacation, two or 
three guys, and tal -- two or three months 
we talk German only. If we say between 
us one word Polish, the guy beat us beca
use he thought [indecipherable] that w e™re

st -- talking something agains
t him. Th-T he reason wh en I come home I start talk 
to my  mo ther, you know, the German. An
d -- and this was -- was very good 
because this -- th-thanks to this I surv
ive. It was many times this, during the 
German occupation that I survived. The firs
t -- first day when the German arrived, 
you know, on the [indeciphera
ble] place, you know, they stop me, the French 
gendarmerie did, was the French  gendarmerie and I was so upset, you know, 

because W-Warsaw survived  -- surrendered, 
it was the first or second day, and the 
ger -- the -- they [indecipherable] the pe
ople you know, to cover the holes, wh ich 
was where -- was for the [indecipherable
] the bombs. And he ca -- ask me. You 
have to work  in [indeciphera
ble] what for? And I -- ve
ry friendly German, I talk 
with him, what for? [indecipherable] and he
 told -- he told me [indecipherable] me 

this, I™m sorry for you. I wa
s so surprised that this way. He think probably th at I 
am German . It was the de -- the reas
on that many time during the action -- I 
reme mb ered another time, during the Germ
an occupation, I have lot of friends, 
you know, what speaking fo r German [inde
cipherable] you know, and once during 
there was the people g -- wa -- catch the people to -- to German. We have -- we 
carry in the pocket, you know, the big si
gn, and [indecipherable] this was a sign 
[indecipherable] German memb
er for the na-national [ind
ecipherable] the national 
socialist [indecipherabl
e], but I will put in the pocket an
d this way we -- we so like 
drunk, and to -- oh, you go away . It was 
the second time I surv
ive, you know, like 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074

young people drink? Risk, make a lot of
 risk. How many times they dri -- they 
going with the, you know, 
with  the guns during -- because we make a lot of 
sabotage, lot of wo rking ag ainst th-the
 Nazis. We make many, many different 
action. The action -- the first my -- action 
was like in 19 -- 1940 or ™41, we put the 
ha -- to -- German got out, the Po lish go
t out, you put the -- no, it wasn™t a bomb  
burst, it was like a material would make a 
fire, what would bur
n the German tr-tr-
trucks and the Po lish trucks. You -- it was 
my first action. And then later we blow 
that -- I was trained, and we bl-blow th
at train. The same time I attend to the 
Polytech Institute because 
in the m -- in the beginning 
the German close the old 
school, and later they opened th e school on
ly for the technician school, you know, 
they need -- they don™t -- 
they need only the people 
to work, the working people 
that there is on that -- they opened the school for the tech
nician and this -- this way 
we work ing with -- and I attend to this
 -- this Polytechnic Institute, I study 
mechanic engineering. It wa-was not en
gineering [indecipherable] engineering, 
they call it technical, the engineering was 
too high educated fo
r the Polish people, 
the Polish like -- supposed to be slaves. 
But the same time wa -- w o rking -- was al-
always belo ng to th e underground army , 
until I was trained like a miner, and my  
specialist w as the blowing the train. I-It
 was during the action what we did few 
times, it was action, the -- one day, the same
 day or the same time was to blow out 
the train in many places, that™s [in d eciphera
ble] it was this orga
nization, and I was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074

trained, you know, the blowing the train. 
We trained [indeciphe
rable] the trains 
would bring supply for that 
-- wou-would bring su pply to  the east front, or we 
blow the train, which was mo st importa
nt, they could [indecipherable] special 
train would bring the German soldier from th
e east front to vaca -- for vacation to 
Germany. There was th -- it was most difficu
lt because this train has a very strong 
-- very strong, you know, sa
fety purpose. On the beginning, on the end of th at 
train, there was a se -- se 
-- machines gun. Additional, th
is train has in the front of 
the machine gun, the locomo
tive, two cars who are load
ing with the -- with the 
sand, you know, to prevent th
e -- if they were blowing the -- preferred they would 
be blowing the empty -- the cars, not th
e -- not the locomotive. There was -- we 
find this, they will make a method that was 
special delayed, they
 will blow up not 
the empty train, but the train 
with the -- with
 the soldiers. 
Q: Me -- Mr. Madejski, one of the things th
at strikes me, listeni
ng to you, and that 
I noticed watching th e video of
 your previous interview -- 
A: Yes? 
Q: -- is you talk about killing, blowin
g things up, with a smile on your face. 
A: Smiling on my face, yes, because now I always, you know, always -- we didn™t 
pay attention, you know, I was -- there were
 -- were -- risk our life. We didn™t pay 
attention for this. In this age we didn™t 
scare too much. We didn™t scare too much. 
Th-The -- the reason, you kn
ow, that we -- we fighting 
for the freedom, which was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
7
the fighting for the freedom, and that in this
 time, there was lot of jokes. The jokes 
which keep the people, you kno
w, in good light. The joke
s was, for instance, this 
way. They calculated the people they -- for 
if -- once a week fe -- if we kill -- if 
the Polish people kill one th
e German soldier, sometime
s accidentally, sometimes 
the German soldier was drunk or some
thing like this, was killed. For th -- 
anything, for this -- in this 
case, they s -- s -- we knew
 they ki-kill from the people, 
grab the people from the street and for 
one soldier they™d 
kill hundred Polish 
citizen, you know. The same di -- if so
mebody -- i-if somebody hide the Jewish 
people. This w -- immediately was -- was on the spot killed. Not -- not caught, 
nothing, just take a gun and kill the guy, 
both of them, th -- and if somebody -- if 
some house hide the joy -- Jewish people
, the all people from the house was -- was 
kill -- sh-shoot on th e spot. They  immediatel
y  -- they bring all house for the yard 
and ki -- on the spot they kill all these 
people, they didn™t f
ool around. You know, 
but we talking we calculated that in Wa
rsaw this time was al
mo st mi llion people, 
you know, they calculate if
 they kill 100 people a da
y even, there is so many 
[indecipherable] we don™t have to worr
y, it will take a long time to destroy 

completely, you know? It 
was the humor. Wi -- thi -- 
this humor, kill the pe -- 
keep the people, you know, 
alive. And th -- hi -- and it was, you know, the food, 
was no food at all because the food was 
only for the German. There were so many 
jokes about this, you know, we -- but 
the people smuggle -- smuggle -- they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
8
smuggle [indecipherab le] smuggling was the sa
me , but if they [indecipherable] the 
smuggler was -- some times was a Volk sdeu
tsche. Volk sdeutsche di -- I talking 
about the people wh ich checking the -- th
e people who smuggle, was a different 
type of so ldier, sometimes was a Volk
sdeutsche was -- Vo
lksdeutsche was a 
Polish people which f-feeling they are -- 
they™re German. They have a -- like a 
[indecipherable] like a half German. The ‚n
other -- this was the worst. The ‚nother 
was a [indecipherable] the people which ke
ep this -- usually most soldier which 
take care about the trains, you know, an
d the people be [indecipherable] by the 
train. These people rather was the not 
so very bad because 
they looking always 
they [indecipherable] to steal somethi
ng. That mean those people smuggle in 
something, they always sp
lit something from these people
 because they send this 
back in sp a -- back -- back 
to the German. This was not 
so very bad, but the wo rst 
was the Gestapo, because the Gestapo so
metime -- this was -- this was terrible. 
This was kill on the spot, too. 
Q: Do you reme mb er any 
of the jokes about food? 
A: Oh  many , man y , man y . 

Q: Can you tell a couple? 

A: Man -- many food. What a -- one was very
 funny, foo -- joke was, they thought 
if -- if the -- that™s what™s -- the jo ke was 
this way, if the -- if the Hitler would like 
to win th e -- England, they have to hire
 the Polish smuggler. But they can -- they 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
9
can smuggle the ger -- all the German soldie
rs, but not alive, but like a -- like a -- 
like a pieces. You understand? You know 
th -- because they smuggle -- smuggle 
in the meat, like in pieces, 
you know, th -- they cut in 
the pieces. They  cut under 
the food, they cut -- they can smuggle thewhole German army  to the England, but 

like in ma -- like in 
pieces, like in meat. 
Q: Now, how was it that you came from, you know, a comfortable family, your 

father was a builder, to be
come a political activist? 

A: It was not a political activist, w as not po
litician. What was -- first of all, before 
w-was s-se cond, I was a -- a scout, and a
ll sc outs you know, was trained in many 
places. First of all, like a scout they have
 -- we have on the -- you know, during 
the vacation, we was do -- y-you know, we 
-- we t -- was trained in different place, 
and it was e-everybody from the scout ha
s to know many, many things. Cooking, 
you know, repair cloth. I bet 
first of all I have in the 
night, you know, something, 
you know, the train, one t -- group agai
nst another and to another was mo st 
important, shooting. Everybody hears we have
 been going to the 
shoot -- to the tar 
-- the target, know how you call the pla
ce when you shooting 
the -- you know, and 
we was training, but everyb
ody -- everybody has to have a [indecipherable] signed 
from the shooting, you know, th e [ind
ecipherable] sign has to shooting fo r 
hundred possible [indecipherable] 99. And 
I have -- you know, I have the shooting 
[indecipherable] doing very good, that th
ere is on, you know, that we know how 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
10
using the guns very, very well. [inde
cipherab le] like young people, you know, 
shooting very well because was like a sport. 
Q: But you were a teenager
 when you -- when you we
re killing, blowing up -- 
A: No, it was not o -- wh-w hen the war wa
s start I  was 16, but
 y-you see, when  
you start working, was after two years late
r, three years later I was 1 8  - 19, this 
year, was, you know, we was -- we d -- 
we -- we live in, you know, in this 
condition that we change our
 mind, because we have to
 start thinking about our 
future, about our freedom, a-about -- about ou
r liv -- life in the future. We know if 
we not -- we™ll be fighting, they
 would be -- they
 would kill us. 
Q: What did your parents think of this? 

A: The parents -- the parent thinking -- all parent thinking th e same. All parent 

thinking the same. Father be
long to some organization, and mo th er belong to  the 
organization, and I have two younger brot
her, and everybody belong to -- to some 
organization.  
Q: Hm. Was the -- the desire to resist 
slow in building, or did it -- it become 
immediately clear that you 
had to resist to live? 
A: No, I do not understand here. 

Q: You were saying that there was re
ally no choice, it was fight or die. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did th at realization come slowly, or was it quick ? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
11
A: Slowly, slowly. It come
 very, very slowly. In th
e beginning in  the -- you know, 
in the beginning was not so very  bad, 
but day after day we called, the German 
tight the screw. You know, it was expressi
on, they start tightening stronger and 
stronger. In the beginning wa
s not very bad, but every time was worse, and 
especially when they
 -- when th ey start winning, yo
u know, the -- on the -- on the 
account that there wa
s much aggressive built, much
 -- because they feel much, 
much stronger, much
, mu ch better. Only on th e end of th e war, but you say, 
talking 1943, ™44 -- well, practically ™44 -- 
this time they would 
be se -- a little bit 
weaker, a little bit weaker, because they sa
w that they start losing. But in the 
beginning those very  strong and they tig
ht the screws stronger because they 
feeling stronger. They  win, you know, Fr
ance, Belgium, Holla
nd, you know, hey, 
and they  feeling you know, like a kings of 
the world. And they treat all people like 
comp letely nothing, like comp letely slav
es. And th is the time, you know, like in 
the -- when they start w
ith the ghetto, with the 
Jewish, it was 1940 -- 19 -- 
approximately 1942. This was start the wo
rst. It was the worst time because they 
still -- it was the -- this wa
s the time when th ey  still th
e most strongest, youknow, 
they -- they -- the 
time when  they  were winning 
in the Russia because in the 
beginning th ey win in the Russia, th
ey got very quic
k to the Moscow. 
Q: Now, you were -- you™re not Jewish, correct? 
A: No.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
12
Q: What were you brought up? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: What religion were you brought up? 

A: Catholic. 

Q: S -- ver -- observant or just casually? 
A: No -- no, observe -- no -- family, old fa
mily in Poland, in 
Poland mo st people 
was a Catholic, you know. 
Q: Right. 
A: Most people were grow up in  Catholic
, you know, was not the -- not the -- like 
a -- a fanatic fan -- not be fanatic, but 
a regular, you know, people, you know, 
[indecipherable] religion. Th
ey™re fanatic or non-fanatical [indecipherable] 99 
percent Polish were the Catholic that ar
e non-fanatical, maybe one percent like in 
religion, sometimes, y ou kn
ow, they™re fanatic, but for 
[indecipherable] relig -- 
Catholic religion not fanatic. 
Q: So when you were grow
ing up, were you aw are that
 Jews were different from 
Catholics? 

A: No, no, was not -- listen, in the -- be
fore the World War second, it was not -- 
nobody pay attention Jewish or not Je
wish, which was -- we have friends, you 
know, lot of friends, you know, we live t
ogether, you know, fri
ends together. We 
have a -- you know, my  have very good 
friend, I have, Jewish, we didn™t pay 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
13
attention, th-there™s no -- was no -- lik
e in the school. In the school was the 
[indecipherable] was religion, they taughtreligion class. The s -- the same -- or the 
same time they divided the student for differe
nt class, they want to go for the -- for 
the Protestant, another for the -- for th
e Hebrew [indecipher
able] Je wish, then 
another go to the Catholic, at the sa
me time, youknow? 
And that -- then 
[indecipherable] the -- you kn
ow, the -- some -- some reli
gion they going attend to 
the s -- to the church, you kn
ow, then -- Sunday 
going to this cr -- to this church, 
to th -- the ‚nother to the 
‚nother church. Sa -- fra -- 
Saturday the Jewish people 
going to  synagogue, but nobody pay attentio
n, was nobody pay attention fo r this. 
Was no -- no -- nobody care what religion they are. 

Q: And when did you become aware? Wa
s it under the Germans, under the Nazis 
that the -- that the division became clear? 
A: No. This time th-th-the 
German, they start clearing this. The story was this 
way, I tell you. Because it was a lot of
 Jewish people which -- it was Jewish 
religion, but they didn™t feel th -- the -- 
nobody pay attention,
 you know, because 
in Polish army  was a lot of [indecipherable]
 J-J-Je - - Jew ish 
people, you know, y -
- I have a friend here, who th e doctor was a -- a ve-very 
high officer in the Polish 
army  [indecipherable] two years ago he 
passed away, you know, he was a Je wish, 
and he was officer, he was a doctor 
in Polish army , what was many -- many 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
14
people, many officer was in 
the Jewish arm -- the Jewi
sh people was in the -- in 
the Polish army . Nobody pay 
attention, nobody care.  
Q: So th en, how did you perceive the crea
tion of the ghetto, the separation of the 
Jews from [indecipherable] 

A: Now this was very, very bad. We feel
 very, very upset, very bad upset. If we 
have a friend, we try to help these frie nds a different way, a different way, you 

know, this -- there is, I don™t know if yo
u know, in my  family what I show you 
there, a Yad Vashem medal, this -- surv
ived 12 people. Still th
ese people -- still -- 
still up to today, practically -- pr-proba
bly two person alive.
 One for sure and 
another I don™t know because
 women had the -- the last time when I talk with her 
was [indecipherable] years old in Jeru
salem.  And th -- another friend with 
[indecipherable] about my  wife when she wa
s sick in the -- Jerusalem, he passed 
away two years ago. He was professor on 
the University of Je
rusalem. And these 
people were survive only th
anks my family, what was 12
 people, not one, but 12. 
Whole group of people, it was different,
 you know, different to a -- you know, 
survive. 

Q: When  you say you -- be
cause of your family, what did your family do? 
A: Th-They sen -- they sen -- they sen -- 
they send -- my family [indecipherable] 
help the Jewish people different way, di
fferent way, you know. The first, most 
important was because my father was a build
er, has the houses, then ha -- he rent -

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
15
- rent -- was rented [indeci
pherable] rent, you know, le
t -- hired the people you 
know in the -- in the houses
, you know, they -- e-even th
is, they will know that for 
the ps -- the German find the one Jewish
 person in  the house, the whole house 
was, everybody was shoot. 
You know the same, I have hid the friends, you know 
what they talking [indeci
pherable] like a kid from the 
ghetto, and they -- they 
keep, you know [indecipherable] after the wa
r second, they find th eir parents, or if 
no parents, th-then the family. If n o t, was 
adopted by the -- anot
her Jewish family. 
Q: Was your father, your family, unusual? 
Did you feel that -- that you were doing 
good wo rk and other people were not? 

A: Th-This time was very difficult, you know
, because we didn™t have -- we didn™t 
have -- see the people was being wro
ng, something wrong.
 We didn™t pay 
attention, you know, therefore, these pe
ople we didn™t pay attention practically 
was [indecipherable] everybody -- every
body was in the big trouble, you know, 
that everybody was very friendly one to
wards each other. Only th e worst people 
what was -- this what was a Volksdeutsch
e which signed the list was German. But 
these people we know right away  where th
ey are and later the German, they move 
you different part they make like a -- like 
it was ghetto for the ge
r -- for the Jewish 
people. They  start making, we call ghetto 
this time for the Ge
rman, because they 
afraid living between the Po lish people. 
They make, you know, 
they -- they take 
out -- evicted the people, the Polish peopl
e from the houses and they take the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
16
apartment for the -- for the German peopl
e. And was whole area in Warsaw, you 
know, when was only 
for the German. The same thi
ng for the German was a -- the 
tram -- train -- you know, the -- not train,
 the str -- str [indeci
pherable] the st ra ss -- 
the street trains, you know, what was th e -- was especially for German only and -- 
and [indecipherable] which was not fo r th
e German. The first two -- the first two 
parts and the first -- first platform was 
for German only, n
obody can come in 
there, no Polish people, because they afraid
 because they -- the 
people, the Polish 
people fighting different way. For inst
ance, you know wh at the pickpocket, the 
thiefs, it was a specialist. They coming an d with the -- with the [indecipherable] 
with the -- something knife, 
got the guns, you know, and 
steal the German -- steal 
the German -- the -- the guns, you know, 
the -- the reason that nobody can for -- 
the Polish peoples stay on the fr-front 
platform, it is only for the German. 
Q: Now you had said earlier that, you know,
 you™ve beco me fluent in German, and 
-- 

A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. Because I™ve heard stories, of 
course, for -- about Jews who could pass 
as Christians, and now you™re saying 
you™re a Pole who could pass as German.

A: Uh-huh, di -- y-yes -- no, no, this wa
s -- this was that -- this was a Polish 
people which feeling that the German. Th
ey find something th
at was his father, 
grandfather, or the gran dda -- somebody,
 you know, was comf -- arrive to the 
police -- Poland from the Germany. They sent  the German a list, that™s means th ey 
feeling -- they have a feeling they belong 
not to the Poland, th
ey belong to the 
Herrfolke. That™s meaning 
-- that™s for the -- for the -- because they calling 
Herrfolkes, you know, the Herrfo
lke -- the -- the mens of 
the world, they™re very 
important. They  feeling [indecipherable] 
and they signed -- they were signed -- 
they signed [indecipherab le] Volksdeutsche. That  mean -- that™s mean 

[indecipherable] are -- 
belong to  the German. 
Q: Because you were fluent in German, di
d you so metimes try to ride the special 
streetcars [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yes, yes, yes, 
yes, yeah, we using the German, you know, 
German, we using this many, many times, 
you know? Wh at I said -- when  -- when 
was -- what the German doing what I telled
 you th at they str -- closed the street 
and killed the people, 
you know, grabbed the people, lo
ad into the trucks and send 
to the German [indecipherable]. This tim
e I use -- usually use the -- my German 
language. Now the ‚nother stor
y. For action. We need th
e -- for instance, we need 
the cars, that w-we find to go to th
e area with this -- where somebody park, 
because usually the cars have most the Ge
rman. The people, Polish people cannot 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
18
have a -- cars at all. W e have -- we can ha
ve a cars, like a comp any, but has to be 
not on the gasoline but on the 
holzgas. That™s mean they
 have a -- you know, built 
a special unit that the wood was burned 
and this wood car was [indecipherable]. 
We need the cars for action, you know [i
ndecipherable] for -- we have to make 
some actio n that we need the car, that we
 go to the car. This time I using fluently 
my German. I come to the German guy, to
ld, listen, do me a big favor, I show him 
the Colt which we got from the spy -- th
at™s me -- from the sky, you know 
[indecipherable] supply, we have supp ly from the -- from the -- by -- by plan es, 
you know? Show him the Co lt we call th
e [indecipherable] you know, caliber 45, 
give me a key and go very slowly on th
e corner straight. Don™t -- don™t look 
[indecipherable] because you see the -- this 
will be shoot on th e spot. It was very 
quick , you know? The fluently German 
[indecipherable] in the beginning wh at 
going on [indecipherab le]. He saw someth
ing wrong, he get the key and stays -- 
listened, you know. 

Q: Did you have an identification card  that said you were German, too? 
A: No, no. No, no, no, no, no. My  identif
ication card probab
ly was kennekarte, 
you know, but always a coun
terfeit, I have only a counterfeit, it was not a -- never 
carry original with my name because if they catch me th e -- my family could be 
[indecipherable] for, you know
. Usually my  documents which I carry with me was 
a different named, or usually it was origin
al. The first name was original, the date 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
19
of birth was original because they can ch
eck if you take, it was original, and the 
address was fr -- c-counterfeit. Usually ad
dress was so the house would go the 
street and how -- house on the street which 
not exist. You know, that™s mean there 
was a street correct, but th -- on the street
 was, for instance, the last number was 
hundred, the house on my  [indecipherable]
 120. Tha-That™s mean the house not 
exist. But not me, it was special organiza
tion, not -- the dib -- special division 
which make a counterfeit document, because was my  original picture, my  
everything except, you know, th e -- not 
name and not [indecipherable] and not 
address. 

Q: When you were active in trying to he
lp the Jews in the ghetto -- it sounds like 

you were quite active. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Did you see this as
 -- why did you do th is? 
A: For wi -- for the good w
ill. For the regular good w
ill. I feel that the people 
cannot be tortured, cannot be -- ever
ybody help everybody. You have to 
understand that, in this Polis
h people, during this time, what happened wasn™t the 
trouble. They was better than brother and 
sister, then one and 
then they helped 
another one, without nothing.
 This -- this em -- this ex
ists in the Polish, I don™t 
know, blood, I think, because I tell you ev
en now when want to
 strike, you know, 
the people want people to have the ‚not
her one, you know th
is, even now, this 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
20
time. And this -- this time, the people, 
you know, help one each other without 
thinking about this. Need th
e help, have to be help.  
Q: Then why is it that there™s this
 friction between Po les and Germans? 
A: Well, they™re Polish and German. What th
e friction? Was the friction just in the 
-- they -- wa-was free country,
 and they tried to make fr -- us the slaves. Was free 
country, would try to make u-us the slave.
 First of all, w e have food, we have -- 
we have to  eat, we can study, we have 
a future. And when th
e German come the -- 
everything was cut. No food, no fu ture, no 
school. It was the -- it was the problem. 
And all we -- on the -- e-every -- every pla 
-- every mo ment you 
would be to shoot 
you, can -- you can -- you al-always was not
 sure that you come back  home if you 
go on the street, because th ey can catch you and send 
you to Germany like a slave 

to work. 
Q: Yeah, but nevertheless, your family wa-was among the minority to help  others, 
to help Jews. It wasn™t that 
all Polish people came together. 
A: All p -- all Polish people was together. 
Almost all Polish people, a very small 
amount, a very, very small amount, but was -- there was -- the Polish people was 

not the worse. Only they -- 
some people afraid, they s
cared, they afra
id. They  did 
not helping, but was no -- no -- no -- 
no -- for instance, was not the spy. If 
somebody hide the Jewish people, and then
 other people know
, very, very rare 
happened  th e spy. This wa
s almo st, almost very, very, very rare. Because if 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
21
[indecipherable] the sp y, then
 no, they would be, by the 
Po lish organization, shoot. 
Because you know how the Ge
rmans shoot on the spot, 
the spying -- the people 
would spying to  the German, the Polish 
organizations make the same -- the -- 
working the same, exactly the same
 way, exactly the same way. 
Q: So when you were work ing to liberat
e people from the ghetto, did you see this 
as liberatin g Jews, or just libiti 
-- liberating other human beings? 
A: Other human being, because we did no
t care about what the nationality, or if 
they would be -- doesn™t matter who. 
They  are hu-human  beings, because you 
know, we know they have to
 help the people. We know 
-- we -- we know the what 
-- we know -- we know there was a concentration camp, we didn™t in the 
beginning, I -- I didn™t know, but some peop
le maybe know, but I didn™t know that 
there are Jewish people, but they -- it wa
s a concen tration camp , and later we find 
the Jewish -- there [indecipherable] th
e Jewish people from. This was last 
concen tration camp, it was during the upris
ing, I talking this
 1944, you know, 
because was two uprising in Warsaw, you 
know, about this one 1943 was in the 
ghetto, a very short time and another was 
53 days, what was 63 days, what was in 
1944, from September first to O-October, 
you know. And during this -- during this 
time we fin d , you know, there was a concen
tration camp and we released the -- it 
was be -- action was very, very quick, the 
Germans surprised that she didn™t -- na -
- even -- it was the [indeciphera
ble] the lunchtime, they l
eave the -- the 
food in the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
22
-- leave on the table and run away, because fo
rtunately was this way, they were at 
time -- this a whole story, but a -- very
 shortly I tell you we have a German tank 
and was prepare very good and the tank 
break the gate, Arbeit Macht Frei, you 
know, was break right away, and the 
German who supplied the German tank 
[indecipherable]. And we have a Polish si
gn, but on the si -- on the side of the 
tank, and they run away  and th-then Jewi
sh people, you know, the Jewish people, 
it was the -- they feel like babies, you 
know, they people wh
ich was -- because the 
German [indecipherable] keep the peop le -- the German which keep in the 

concen tration camp, only not the terrorist 
people, but the -- there™s an underh anded 
-- there™s people always lose his mind. They
 -- they f -- didn™t feel -- you don™t 
know if you™re free, they didn™t ev
er expect they will be free again.

A: Listen, everybody would 
like to do something. E-Ev
erybody would like to be 
in th -- his mind like a hero. Tho -- I -- th
is is almost true, 
and everybody would 
like to do something, do it -- help to 
somebody, you know, 
do something wrong 
for the Germany, you know that™s m
ean? Everybody -- since the young -- the 
young boys, you know, every
body tried to do something,
 even if the sign they 
make, like young people make a V on the st
reet, on the house, was victoria, he was 
proud that he did so mething ag ainst th
e Germans, you know. The German ma ke a 
big victorious sign, you know, they  start 
feeling when they st
art -- y ou know when 
the east -- the west [indeciphe
rable] was get and when  
they start in -- in the 
Russian -- Russia, you know, th ey have a 
-- they have, you know, victory. They 
make a big sign from the wo od, victory, 
what the people Po
lish doing. They use 
some kerosene and put on there, becaus
e the sign [indecipherable] which was big 
V from wood. They  put some kerosene and 
burned this, this victory, you know, 
there was -- everybody feel that so me
thing -- everybody tried to do something 
against -- against the German. Even if 
it was some organization, but even not 
organization, some private person -- peopl
e tried to do something against -- wrong 
to the Germany. For instance,
 they have a transport fro
m the -- from the trains. We 
blow the train, but the -- now th e young 
people using the sand, put the sand when 

you have a oil for the -- for the -- for 
the wh eels, you know? Was a different -- 
different method. There was no sugar, but
 somebody wh-when they find the sugar, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
24
they put -- they -- when
 they park the German trucks 
they put the sugar to the tank, 
you know, because the sugar 
go to the -- to the gasolin
e [indecipherable] and blow 
the engine, you know? And 
everybody have a different
 -- different method. We 
have lot of [indecipherab
le] from that -- fro
m the, you know, from alliance, 
because we get the -- the 
supply from alliance. We 
get the guns, we get the 
material, the -- that on -- the material, you 
know, explosive material, we get many, 
many things for the -- fr-from 
the alliance. Some go -- mo
st go to the partisan 
because was a big partisan. I was not a pa
rtisan because I was in Warsaw all the 
time, but some people what was in the 
field fighting, you know, the German, 
different way. Some people has to go to 
the partisan, from my friends, too. I-I was 
two weeks only, because everybody was two 
weeks, because in 
1944 -- in 1944 in 
January was arrested by Gestapo, th
ree of my friends, you know, from 
organization. The -- all other, wh ich was 
another guys, he has the order, go out 
from Warsaw, because we di -- afraid that 
they s -- in the Gestapo [indecipherable] 
beating, torture, they already put the na
mes. That this the reason we have to go 
away, they sent us for the parti -- for 
th-the partisan. That was only two weeks 
after, two weeks. This fr -- these people 
was executed in  Gestapo, but nobody -- 
they didn™t tell nothing about nobody, that
™s mean they [indecipherable] you know 
[indecipherable] inter -- you know, co
unter -- counterfeit, 
you know, ca -- the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
25
organization wh ich [indecipherable] was th
e story, that™s mean there was -- they 
didn™t say nobody, they -- they was tortur
ed for the dead, but they  say nothing. 
Q: What i -- 
A: The -- they™re reason that I came 
back, like [indecipherable] again. 
Q: What do you think of 
Germany and Germans now? 
A: Listen, this is di -- very, very  difficu
lt. Practically you don™t think about this too 
much. Still, I have, you know, I tell you 
true, I will not buy the German car. I 
don™t buy nothing what is German, but is
 something difficult, do you know -- there 
is -- there may be different situation, 
but still in my mind is -- would be never 
friendly to the German and never will be
 trusting to German. [doorbell rings]. 
Sorry, there™s my  [indecipherable] 

Q: Do you need to -- 
A: No, no. My wa -- sister-i
n-law open [indecipherable] 
Q: When  you were younger, 
did you believe in God? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you now? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Let me wait til this is over. 

A: Pardon me? 
Q: I™m going to wait til this sound is -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
26
A: Uh-huh, til sounds get over. There™s fri
end of my s -- from [indecipherable] 
Social Security number what they  [indeci
pherable] you know wh en th ey talking. 
We have a lot in our organization because
 I belong to  the veteran™s organization -- 
the veteran™s organization, this Armia 
Krajowa, holy Po lish army , we have six 
people and only s -- s -- alive is still tw
o more. This one and 
one more, they spent 
few years in Auschwitz, because Au
schwitz on the ar -- one -- one of 
concen tration camp was Auschwitz which mo  -- o -- put the numbers of the people 
on [indecipherable] the other concentration 
camp they did not, like my wife and 
my  sister-in-law, they was in Ravensbrück. 

Q: I want to ask you about that in just 
a seco nd, because I™m -- I really want to 
know about that. But back to the believi
ng in God. Wh en the Germans came and 
tried to destroy your count
ry  and your people, what 
did you th ink God was doing? 
A: Listen, this is -- this is
 difficult to say. Nobody th
ink about this, you know, th-
the people prayed  to the God, you know, but
 [indecipherable]. This is difficult to 
say, you know, nobody think ab out this
. Everybody pray, you know, I tell you 
only one th -- ‚nother things that the ch
urch keep the people  in these difficult 
times, all people together. The church keep
 -- very often they keep , and I tell you 
this -- this time, the -- to
 the church, during the o-oc
cupation, during this time, 
when it was very difficult to the wa -- 
Catholic church, come the people from 
different religion, not only 
the Catholic, come to diffe
rent religion because they  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
27
thought God is one who have to pray to 
the God this way will 
-- probably will be -
- help us. And th e religion keep the peop
le very close, very close together. 
Q: So you didn™t feel that -- that ther
e was a -- a -- a Jewish God and a Catholic 
God, and a -- 
A: No, nobody -- God is one , you know. And this one, wh
at they told you, thi -- 
thi -- before the war second, He is now -- 
many, many things He™s changing. I old 
man, you know, 80 years old, but th -- s
till I donot understand w
hy is this dividing 
between th is -- this -- you know, religion.
 I understand the -- the -- some people 
they are fanatic. You cannot talk about fa
natic. This fanatic is very, very small 
amount of the person, very -- in all re
ligion wh at I said. Probably in Jewish 
religion is very small amount of the fanatic. 
In the Catholic religi
on, in the -- in the 
mo -- Moslem, may-maybe Moslem more 
because the problem is the additional 
what I -- wa -- my -- this is my prop -- pr
actical -- private feeling, that fanatics, 
mo st fanatics ja -- are low educated  peopl
e. I think that educated people they  are 

not fanatic, they thinking in  the right way.
 And lo w ed ucated people, if you take a 
look, th-the people which -- the Arabs, 
which you know, fanatic
, working, fighting 
with the -- with Israel. Take a look these 
people, the level of these people is very, 
very low. I only surp rised that how -- big 
final thing they find this to any people 
which make a -- a September 11, yo
u know, blow the -- the -- after 
[indecipherable] th-they make 
this terrorist action. I ve
ry surprised because these 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
28
people was trained, and this was -- but it 
was not intelligent, this only was -- half a 
brainwash, I think, because th-the -- they
 was trained for the right way, was not 
simp ly training [indecipherable] like a pilot.
 But this th-the reason that I think this 
time was not too many fanatics and we fight
ing, we fighting, you know, with the -- 
with the -- wi -- against the ef 
-- to  get -- to the same enemy. 
Q: The Germans. 
A: Germans. And later, and later after 
German come the communist, it was the 
‚nother -- was the ‚nother story, but wa
s not [indecipherable] up til 1945, it was 
not the -- this was a ma -- not so easy most
 -- most difficult that the Gestapo, the 
KGB. 

Q: And how did y
ou meet your wife? 
A: I wi -- I met my wife in
 the f-fu -- to -- friend of my
 house, you know. It was 19 
-- 1940 -- 1949 I was married, it
 was 1947 - 1946, someti -- 
™40 si -- end of ™4 8, a 
friend of my house.  

Q: Now, your wife was Jewish? 
A: No. 
Q: Not Jewish? 

A: My wife not Jewish. My wife was 
Catholic. My wife was Catholic, was a 
Catholic. 
Q: How did she come to be in Ravensbrück? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
29
A: Bi -- to -- to -- to Israel? 
Q: How did she come to be in a ca
mp? You said she was in a camp, no? 
A: Di -- she was in the concentration camp, yes. 
Q: Yes, how did that happen? 

A: The [indecipherable] a lot of Polish peop
 -- lot of Catholic people was in that 
concen t camp. But listen, first of all, 
he is friend of mine, he tell you that 
Auschwitz was built not for the Jewish pe
ople. Auschwitz wa-was built original 
for the -- for the Polish peop
le. They didn™t -- the Germ
an do not recognize the 
Jewish or the Catholic, they built for 
the Polish people, doesn ™t matter what 
religion, for the Polish people. For the Po
lish intelligentsia, for 
the Pole -- th-this 
was built for this, this was the purpose wh
y they build the Au
schwitz. And th-then 
-- then -- then built the -- th
e -- i-in this -- Jewish people to Auschwitz, I don™t re-
reme mb er, but I think th ey started arriving 
1942, I think, or ™40 -- ™41 or ™42. No t 
in the beginning. The-Then later start 
-- maybe before they arrive, but was not 

[indecipherable] like a Jewi
sh, like a Polish people, beca
use la-later they start 
divided for the religion, for 
the -- for the Gypsy, for th
e Jewish, for the Catholic, 
for the -- for the different religion, 
for the homo sexuals [indecipherab le] you 
know. But in  the beginning the -- all people, pole -- Po lish people, doesn ™t matter 

what religion, what -- what
 view point, has to go to  
the concentration camp.  
Q: How wa -- how was she liberated? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
30
A: She was liberated by the Ru ssian ar
my . My sister-in-law tell you the cor -- 
exactly because they was a
ll time together. They was -- 
they was catch up the -- 
the uprising in Warsaw, 1943, because this
 was in the old town, what the worst 
place, you know, because I was -- during 
the -- I was during the uprising, I was, 
you know, y -- organizing the Polish home 
army , you know, that
 I go through the 
whole town Warsaw, but some parts of th
e Warsaw was captured by the German 
[indecipherable] in the -- in th
e first so -- in the first beginning, they  didn™t take a -
- prisoners, they kill everyb
ody over there. Th
ey kill everybody,
 doesn™t matter 
who was kill, put the gasoline and burn ev
erybody was involved
 [indecipherable] 
later in the -- after approximately whole mo
nth, they start take the -- take the 
people to the concentration camp, a
nd to th e -- becaus
e they need the 
[indecipherable]. They tookmy wife, my sister and my
 mother-in-law, they took 
to the German, to the concentration camp,
 and later my sister and my wi -- my 
wife and my sister-in-law, they was yo
ung, they was to th
e mu -munition factory 
close to the Berlin, they was in Ravensbr
ück, and from Ravensbrück they gave to 
the radical commander. Just before thei
r placement they was working for the 
German -- for the Ge
rman industry.  
Q: Oh. Were you involved in -- in
 any direct libe
ration of camp ? 
A: No, no, only -- only in 
Warsaw, this one. Only liber
ation the [indecipherable] 
Shufka they call -- they was a -- in Wars
aw was a few concen tration camp , but the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
31
-- the last o n e what was on the -- what 
we can liberated, it was liberated in 
[indecipherable] Shufka, you know, in Wa
rsaw. It was there before this up -- 
before this action, our battalion, Zoska,
 get the Yad Vashem medal. We™re very 
proud because only two organization what 
I told you, Zegota, wh ich take care 
about ba -- kids -- babies, you know, and 
th e ‚nother organization is Zosk a wh ich 
get the Yad Vashem medal after a long tim
e, because the guy who take care ba -- 
from our organization, they -- in the be
ginning they -- Yad Vashem organization 
told that we have to liber
ated this concentration ca
mp because was on our way, 
and t-then  we explain, no, we don™t have
 to, because we have two different ways. 
We liberated because was a human be 
-- you know, always organiz -- and now, 
after the -- 60 years after the war, you se
e different viewpoints in many people 

there. Many people -- some people have 
a completely different viewpoint, you 
know, they thinking differ
ent way. We -- our -- my me
ntality, [indecipherable] is 
completely, slightly different.
 What I told you in the be
ginning, we was altogether 
how we say -- how -- how my friend there, we -- we fight together, we eat 
together, we die together. Doesn™t matte
r what religion. How many people you 
know in partisans was th 
-- the -- the Jewish people, nobody take -- care was it. 
Wa -- if I had to [indecipherable]
 to a German, it was a friend. 
Q: When  did you get the medal?

A: Yad Vashem? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I don™t have privately, I don™t have a private. My family has and the -- the -- 

and my  battalion to which 
I belong got the medal. 
Q: When  did you get it? 

A: It was the -- oh, it was -- I don™t reme mb er exactly the day. With  the memo ry is 

worse and worse. I got the copy, they sent
 me the copy. I thi
nk it was -- it was like 
in 19 -- 1994 - ™95, something like this. Five years ago. 

Q: And you went -- you went to Israel? 

A: Pardon me? 

Q: You went --  
A: No, no, I was not. I was in Israel. I wa
s in Israel, but I was what I tell you in 
ninet -- in 2000 with my wife, we in Israel.

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
36
A: N -- I™m very surprised, I™m very su
rprised that organization would -- would --
because everything what we did, we didn
™t expect there would be -- any time we™d 
be honored in this -- nobody would thin
k about this. Nobody 
think ab out paying 
for this. Doesn™t matter not -- I not talki
ng the paying in the money, just talking 
about the honors. Nobo
dy think about this. Nobody was 
in this i-i-interesting. And 
this I was surprised. Oh, 
oh, oh, oh, oho. Thank you 
God there™s somebody thinks 
still about me, you know, and especially fo r the [indecipherable] you know, this is 
very surprised and very glad, that™s at le
ast somebody exists w
ho think th -- what™s 
happened . And from the ‚nothe
r hand, what they 
told me later, 
listen, you know 
that Yad Vashem, it d o -doesn™t for free, 
somebody who take -- would like to that 

you get this medal has to pay fo r this. 
I was very surprised [indecipherable] I 

didn™t know that has to pay for 
this, you know? Something recognition. 
Q: [Bell rings] Four o™clock. Wh en  did you leave Poland? 

A: I leave Poland in
 1968. I -- 19 -- 1968, it was th
e story because I have always 
problem, and not financing problem, becau
se I™m pretty smart engineer and h-
happy always do something, keep [indeci
pherable] not the -- like a blue collar job 
because sometimes w as a difficult [indeci
pherable] I have a good pa -- you know, 
can make money different ways, did bel -- 
belong to the [inde
cipherable] to the 
[indecipherable] and my son wa
s very br-bright man, bright boy. He has the same 
problems because the father was not too go
od. And fortunately, i-in Poland is like 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
37
a -- a game [indecipherable] 
the game in the school, y
ou know, the -- the testing 
from the school, they 
pu -- they call in Poland Olympi
c game in different science. 
And my  son has the first place in whol
e Poland in -- from ma
thematic, and first 
place from the physics, too -- too, and si xth place from the Latin, you know, even 
this way. And th is way I can get the passpor
t, because seven years I tried to get the 
passport to go ab road , we cannot get the 
passport because I was enemy of the ci -- 
re-regime -- of the system and I was not belong, I don™t want belong. I ha -- they -- 

I play different function in the factories,
 always all -- only pay [indecipherable] 
this function, but that™s what that they
 [indecipherable] yo
u know, like a position, 
because deposition has to bel-belong to th
e member of the parti -- to the member 
of the pa -- communistic party. I was neve
r, you know, they always make a job for 
somebody, you know, and up 
to  seven years when  they  -- my  son win this 
Olympic game, it was the mo ment that he
 can go to the univer
sity without exam, 

without this, because if we -- if w e not wiz -- pass this, he will go never to the -- 

any university, because when 
you go to the university, th
ey need the points. First 
of all, I was the enemy of the system
, there was a minus point. I was the 
intelligent, was a minus or zero point and 
so on. You know, that
™s mean son what 
was -- father belong to the 
communist party had a plus th
ree or four or sometimes 
five, depend higher, more points, that my
 son will be maybe minus point or zero 
point, another guy have six 
point. Doesn™t matter what the knowledge, wa -- how 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
38
he smart is. And this way, because he can go  to the university w
ithout test, then ha 
-- I stay in the -- in the [indecipherab
le], this PolishKGB, three times in 
[indecipherable] clock in the mo rning and that
 list -- after a few days I get that list, 
have interview with the -- the -- some o
fficer, and he to ld me, why you™d like to 
go to United States? I told, because I woul
d like to see my fam
ily, and what they 
doing over there, my  family, you know? Then
 I had -- my  son has a five mon vaca 
-- five month vaca -- five m
onths vacation becaus
e he win this, a
nd h-he -- da, you 
would like to go and stay probably in th
e United States? No, what for? In United 
States education is very, very ex pensive,
 and he has the free education. And no 
problem at all. Okay, after this I g et th
e passport for three months only, wh ich was 
my  passport was valid only three months a
nd this way I come to United States, but 
they told  me, your wife cannot go over th
ere, because you -- she has to stay like a 
hostage in the Poland. She cannot put a -- ap
ply for the passport. Then I come with 
my  son, and my  son had the interview an
d get to the MIT and then ti -- I would 
like to come back because I don™t have a 
future over there. I 
[indecipherable] the 
language very, very poor, 
the English, but the -- ever
ybody thought me to be 
comp letely dumb and not stupid, but dumb , and co mp letely if you go back  to 

Poland [indecipherable] your son has th
is -- this, probably  he got the full 
scholarship and -- and [indecipherable
] everything. And I -- very difficult 
communicate with my  wife because the -- 
all telephones or letter was, you know, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
39
checking by the ka -- KGB, 
like the Polish UBA. Then, 
through the fr -- my -- my 
friends was in Sweden, we go -- correspond
ed over there and my wife told, you 
stay over there, I find a way that I go away . Sh e -- we have a small house. She sold 
this house -- sold this house for 1,000 
-- 1,000 hundred  dollars. And this whole 
money, she got the bribery to so mebody 
who get the passport for th ree weeks to 
Austria, because we have -- in Austria she 
has a first co usin in Austria, and -- and 
my cousin from Austria sent a letter. The 
letter was this way. 
[indecipherable] is 
sick, she will passed away prob
ably in three or four weeks and sh e is millionaire, 
and she will not -- if my wife will not come 
to the Austria, not take all -- all of the 
jewelry and the money what she ha
s over there and bring it Poland 
[indecipherable] grab by the 
Austrian family -- that th
is was a -- this letter was 
written in the Polish, then i-it was si 
-- it was stamped wi -- from the Polish -- 
what [indecipherable] Austrian police only 
recognize they ha -- her signature, and 
signed th e docto r, what the doctor was [indecipherable] they told  him what was 

going on and somebody else signed this le
tter, and this letter was lik e a document 
because in Poland always 
you has to be bumaga. Buma
ga, that™s mean document. 
They  bring this document and to  this doc
ument [indecipherable] 1,000 dollars, you 
know, and passport for three weeks to 
Au stria and she [indecipherab le] three 
weeks to the Austria, she come after 10 mo
nths, because we come June -- July in 
1968, and my wife come May ™69, one 
year later she come to United State.

s medical system and [indecipherable] 
from this company I installed in Mount Si
nai Hospital in Manhattan because I am 
specialist in the x-ray equipm
ent, I installed the x-ray 
machine and I was surprised 
because the boss of this department wa
s Dr. Wolfe [indecipherable] was very 
angry for me because always when he is
 -- when he thought 
white, everybody has 
wh -- thought white. When he
 was everysa -- when he 
thought black, everybody 
says black. And he to ld, Mike, when y
ou say -- when I say black, you say no 
doctor, this is not black, this is gray. 
How come it™s gray? Because you -- I have 
sometime different -- different viewpoints. 
And after few times this discussion, he 
thought I have enough disc
ussion with you, you have to  work  for me, no mo re 
discussing. And [indecipherable] I though
t I work for Philips, 
I have very good 
pay, I have a good -- a good job, I have 
a comp any car, I have everything I don™t

A: Very good. I never had 
any kind of problem, you ba
 -- I have a problem with 
language because my language was not th
e greatest, and I feel always, you know, 
the people helped me, even 
in the language, that I feel
 very, very good. And first 
my job, when I was working 
with Philips, I was in the ch
arge for s -- installation. 
This I reme mb er very good, for it was fi

was leader of the job, I have a -- a six

Jewish, he speak a little bit Polish. He wa
s very friendly. He invited me to his 
home, you know, because he 
know that I from Poland and

problem with lot of trouble. He taught 
me listen, you in  charge here. You don™t 
have to fo ol around. Tell to the boss he

like for my  duty, what I do like I -- what 
I find for them -- country, for the Poland,

Q: What was that experience like? 

A: No -- very -- experience, you know, ve
ry difficult to find because not too many 
people, not too many friends over there.
 Most my friend passed away. I have my 
mo th er, b u t my  mo th er was co min g  to  me 
very often during this time when it was 
United States, because my 
wi -- my mother was the 
same like myself. She was 
stayed to there to get -- they don™t want
 get the passport, they thought, how you 
grow up your children, they
 -- your children was agains

would like to go to United States, stand w
ith your children. My
 wife thought no,

me bread, you have to  pay me
 an pension plan [indecip
herable] ma ke your life 
easy, don™t worry. She was very, very a
ggressive you know, with the communist 
people. Very aggressive, you know. She 
passed away, was 98, and all the time she 
fight with this system, always have e
xplanation fo r the communists. The same 
with -- during th e German occupation, you 
know, she help peop
le a-as much as 
she can. I remember in the house was hi
red the -- some people, you know, from 
different purpose, because hire people -- is
 not only the Jewish people was hired 
the people, you know, was lo
oking for the Gestapo, was -- was the -- there was -- 
was the people which was -- the people wh
at was come from -- from -- was sent 
by th e Po lish -- the Polish -- Polish governm
ent in exile from -- 
from -- from -- in 
eng -- was in England, they dropped th
e people on parachutes for different 
purpose, and these people, you know, they  
-- the German know there was a plane, 
the people was drop off, they
 know, but they lo
oking for these pe
ople. They -- the 
people was hide, they  was moving for on
e day from place to place you know, the -
- they kind of -- cause these people coming 
has to be trained in many ways in the 
Poland, because they 
come from -- most from England,
 they have to be trained 
how they  -- how they  hide on th e street, wh
ile working on the st
reet. They  have to 
have experience in living in  the occupatio
n town, occupation country, wh at -- in 
the beginning was not easy, but ev erybody
 learn and train himself every day, 
every day you have 
more experience.

little bit scare, beca -- I tell you, because still there practically was not the -- 
practically was not the communist any more, but still -- still was not the -- I don™t 
feel it too -- too good because additi
onal, I was stripped from the Polish 
citizenship, first of all. I don™t have a Po
lish citiz -- I was stri
-stri-stripped for the 
citizenship. And in my American passport th
ey told that the Un
ited States will not

lot of pressure, you know, this was the 
first time. Later -- I was later i-in  the [i

day. There was like a -- like a ge-gets -- 
some people -- it was -- th e few people 
get a -- they start getting th e passport and 
people apply for the passport and was to 
able get this passport and my  brother catch  this mo ment, you know, that he was to 
-- was so very lucky that he apply and he
 get this passport. Not too many people -- 
later they stop ag ain, you know, beca
use in the communist syste m was a -- 
sometimes better, sometimes worse, you know
, like this not -- it™s not equal, like it 

was no democracy [indecipher
ab le] this -- you know, 
this dictatorship and 
sometime dictatorship, you know, changing
 for better, sometime fo r worse, but the 
-- it [indecipherable] th-this changing [ind
ecipherable] very short time, sometimes 
few weeks, you know. Only th-the [inde
cipherable] changes for -- forever. But 
before they change fo
r -- for a short time.

Q: You -- you mentioned in your previous 
interview, and you brought it up today, 
the shortage of food. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you tend now to have 
a lot of food in  the house? 
A: He -- where, here? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: [indecipherable] is no problem at all,
 no. Listen, this was -- you don™t even  -- 
this is difficult to tell, I tell you. When
 you going to  hungry sl
eep, you have to 
sometime [indecipherable] many time I go very
 hungry  sleep, you have to had the 

warm water drink because if
 you were very hungry , you 
cannot close your eyes, 
you cannot sleep. If you drink the warm wate
r, the hot water a little bit, you still 
can sl-sleep, you know, you ca -- you was ab
le to sleep, not -- not so easy like -- 
like now. No w I -- you -- you -- you try to 
not eat because you don™t want to get 
the weight. [indecipherable] when I 
was young was opposite way, you know? 

Sometime we have only potatoes, you know, 
this -- we -- that the most important 
was [indecipherable] onion because onion 
was a vitamin for everything, was a -- 
that the reason that you 
keep the people alive. 
Q: What™s your favorite food now? 

A: Now? But now is not [indecipherable] now 
I try to eat just little , just a little bit. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
54
Q: How about when you first -- when food 
became available to you? Wh en it was 
no longer so scarce? What did y
ou really, really want to eat? 
A: Difficult to say at this age, don™t reme mb er, you know? This I don™t rememb er 
how it was, but hey, I remember -- I -- I 
half rememb er, you know, of many things 
I reme mb er after the uprising, you know, came m-my  aunt. Sh e was a old man -- 
old woman, you know, and sh
e bring a -- a soup, was pot
atoes, it was few pieces 
of meat, was so -- tasting so  good, oh my God, was so tasty because she has whole 
bowl I can eat. It was so -- tasting so 
good. The people which never was hungry do 
not understand how the food 
can [indecipherable]. I wa
s many, many times in my  
life hungry.  

Q: You moved from a life where you didn
™t have very much, where yo -- as a 
young man you had -- had kille
d a lot of people, had taken a lot of risks, had 
helped a lot of people. You moved to a co
untry with th is image of guns, violence, 
the wild west, the gang warfare, all of 
this stuff. How did that strike you? 
A: I tell you, I perl -- I tell you my  first experience. When I came to this country, 
then I have to do somethin
g, I looking fo r a job. I didn™t have documents, have 
nothing this time, I didn't now just -- a
pply for the -- for the 
-- for the permanent 
visa I apply, but this time I get the job.
 And it was a burned 
building, building was 
burned, an d they need ed  somebody who ca
n remove this old broken pieces, the 
burned pieces, you know, for the house. Wa
s a very difficult job because was in 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
55
July, it™s 1968, very hot summer and I wo rk
ing on this building, remove this old 
broken pieces, and come the police. And I 
scare -- I was scare. I th ought I didn™t 
know what I have to with my
self. I scared that I -- I wa
s scare, and the police start 
smiling. She was [indecipherable] smiling because she -- for my  dirty face, and 
she ask me, hey Buddy, there are dogs in 
th is house? I understand dogs, I thought 
no dogs, and she left. I thought, oh my  goo
dness, this guy didn™t arrest me. They 

didn™t ask me for nothing, only for the do
gs. [indecipherable] didn™t ask, di-didn™t 
check my documents, he didn™t say th -- 
what I am doing here. Was -- for me w as 
something -- something what 
I cannot believe what is goi
ng on because of every 
time, you have to carry documents, you 
have to show your documents, like a 
German. During the German you have 
-- need  the kennecarte, you know? Then 
later you need the, you know, some othe
r docu ments. Still I have my kennecarte 
because during the uprising in
 Warsaw if I w as -- I was -- when I was wounded in 
the leg, I was in the hospital [indecipherabl
e] unfortunately only two days I was in 
the hospital and I was -- the bomb exploded,
 the bomb explode and I was with the 
debris covered completely. I was unconsc
ious. I will -- don™t 
know how th -- how 
long. The people find me later, th en I -- 
draw me out from there -- from there -- 
from this debris, from this house. All -- 
all -- all people was [indecipherable] in 
this house there was killed except me, 
because the explosion thro w away me, you 

know. And later, in the 1945
, when the war was -- was 
u p  -- finished, you know, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
56
was exhumation on these people from this
 -- from this place. And I watch 
exhumation because was very 
good friend of mine was ove
r this killed, and I ke -- 
I went to the exhumati on. Was six caskets 
in the church on th
e -- in Warsaw. I go 
because was friend of mine and I come a lit
tle bit late th at I didn™t pay attention 
for this casket, because six caskets late
r when they call me, they grab me, one 
woman come grab me  for the hand and br
in g me to the casket and so, hey Mike, 
take a look, this is your -- it was in th
e casket my  name, my  father™s name, 
everything was mine. [indecipherable] my
 body was -- was not my body, I was 
alive. What happened , when  was explosion,  explodes me, take me away, they  take 

off from me my whole -- all 
my  clothes, my  document, everything. When  they  
exhumated the people they find the doc
uments, they find somebody, you know, 
they put these documents to th is body. It was the story, 
you know, that I was in my 
own funeral. And later I go to that -- I -- 
later I go to th e Red Cross and told , no, 
listen, I am still alive, I™m not passed away
. And they give me my document, what 
was with this -- what was, you know. 
Q: Wow, you still have it. Amazing. 
A: And this is from the 
[indecipherable] ausw eis. 
Q: Wow. Huh. Why do you keep  these? 

A: This wa -- what?  
Q: Why do you keep it? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
57
A: Th -- bec -- keep the [indecipherable] 
like a photo, you know? Well, maybe if 
my son will be interested, but I have to 
keep  this, you know, because this I get -- I 
get this, it was a big problem with this be
cause -- [ah, it doesn™t matter, this is -- 
Q: Little piece there. 
A: -- but with the piece] -- you know, when  I go to  the Red Cross because the 
when di -- when I went to -- they told -- you have to 
go to the Red Cross because 
Red Cross has all document wh ich was, you 
know, over there. I went to the Red 
Cross, I took this in. I 
was on my  funeral today, but I am not dead. I was 
[indecipherable] because you have my docum
ents. Well, they fi
nd my documents, 
but they  [indecipherable] start my  problem,
 the problem with KG
B that th -- that 
there™s something cheating because they trie
d to make a -- the people which alive, 
they ka -- tried to make a document with
 people [indecipherable] the people would 
like to change his name, his ma -- his pers
onality. They afraid 
that they could try 
and go th is way. I have a
nother problem. You know, th is was the -- I have a good 
experience with the [indeciphe
rable] is difficu lt, it™s the 
big, big, long story with 
this.  

Q: When  your son was growing up, did 
you tell him about your ex periences? 

A: Sure. He know -- he know very well an
d this the reason th at he grow up in  the 
same -- in the same lik e I grow up, in 
this patriotism, he grow in the same 
patriotism. This mean in th
e right way, and the reason,
 you know, that he right 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
58
way, he has a problem when  he attend to
 the school, he was a very, very good 
student and he have some problem but 
he was throw away 
once year from the 
school, you know, when  it was [indeciphe
rable]. I don™t rememb er, the third or 
fourth  grade, you know, very young. This
 time he was too stupid to lie, you know, 
and this he discuss with th -- his teacher, and explain to teacher that he -- that she 
is not right, and he bring en cyclopedia 
and [indecipherab le] history and tell her, 
this is document, this is document. You 
stupid, you cannot attend to this school, 
out. But then I talk to the di
rector and director, listen, 
I can do nothing, you know, 
the time now don™t belong to the [indeciph
erable] memb er of the party, of the 
communistic party wh at you can say. You 
have to take your son to th e ‚nother 
school. 
Q: Do you ever speak German? 
A: When ? 
Q: Now. I mean, given your experiences. 

A: No, it i -- it is -- when I come to th
e Un ited States, in the beginning I use the 
German a lot because I di
dn™t speak too good Eng
lish, you know, and all 
instruction the German -- the -- the books
 from the Philips when
 I went for -- for 
medical Philips [indecipherable] books in
 three languages. Was English, Ger-
German and -- and -- and Dutch. The Dutch 
is difficult, Englis
h I didn™t know too 
perfect, you know, that I use the German. 
And I speak -- but later, slowly, slowly, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
59
slow, I switch to -- to Englis
h, but when -- the first tim
e I was in Poland, what I 
said, after this 18 years, 
from the Poland I go what I 
thought in the beginning to  
Austria to visit my co
usin, my wife cousin, that in th
e a-airport I starts -- in the -- 
in the Vienna I start talk to the German
. And after the whiles, it co me back. But I 
don™t think that would be able to 
now because I don™t use any mo re.  
Q: How do you feel now toward
 armed conflict in the world? 
A: This is very, very diffi
cult situation. This is very difficult situation, I don™t 
know how this -- everything 
will be finish. Is very diffi
cult situation because is too 

many terrorists, too many terrorists and this
 -- this terrorist is not terrorist pri-
problem. The ter -- the problem I think is the fanatics, and the -- the lot of leaders 
which you know, bring the young people to 
the -- to the fighting 
[indecipherable] I 
-- I feeling now how was the leader, we 
as young boy during th
e German -- during 
the German occupation and this
 young people was bring to this action b -- at home 

by th e older people. But we™re fighting, we
™re feeling, we -- we -- w e™re feeling 
we™re trusting, we know what we™re figh
ting for. In the same way I think lot of 
young people -- because if you take a look 
at these terrorists are young people, the 
same the youth, the brave -- we no [indeci
pherable] wars, because we was patriot, 
but these people, I think th ey -- like you 
[indecipherable] wars, and this the reason 
that the -- this the -- the reason that they
 fighting, they are fanatics. They are 
fighting maybe they  did it or something, 
what about. I tell you th e example, th-the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
60
very s -- the very simple ex
ample. In 1936, I think I wa
s student, and this time was 
fight in the Spain between communist and 
Franco. And lot of people from Poland 
-- not a lot, but some young student, trie
d to run aw ay from Poland, go to th e 
Spain for fighting. One, oh, I will be fight
ing with the -- agains
t the Franco, I go 
be -- are you going to Franco, fight ag
ainst the commu nists, you know th e people 
just would like to do something, you know
? Have so much energy
 they tried to do 
something. And this is the sa
me -- same situationhere, 
and this, I think is similar 
situation because this terrorists w h at 
is coming, they™re coming from different 
country, even if the Afghanistan, even if 
the -- in the Iraq, th
ey co ming the people, 
and not only the people which living over
 there, coming the -- the terrorist from 
different -- from different country. You know
 about this. And this
 is -- this is the 
problem. This is a very difficult situa
tion, I don™t know 
how [indecipherable] 
survive this is very, very 
difficult situation. Bush, my
 opinion going right way, but 
he is -- has very, very, very difficult j
ob, because with the partisan, what is 
partisan is very difficult to win. I k
now how during th e German occupation, the 
German and th -- cannot win the partisan, 
and the -- the Russian, which is a much 
stronger, mu ch [indecipherable] would try 
-- try fighting with th e Afghanistan and 
they go away from the Washingt -- Afghani
stan they cannot win this, and th-the 
problem is he -- not simply -- not easy. 
United State have a good politic because 
they tried to involve in that -- to brin
g a de-d emocracy by th e people which living 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
61
over there, but still there™s too many fanatic
s. This is a problem and the -- th-the 
problem, education over there, the level of
 education, the people [indecipherable] 
not very high. They  know how readin
g and writing, but this -- this only 
everything, and this the reas
on that they still -- th-the re
ason that they still going to 
the -- to the order of [indecipherab le], or 
this -- or the -- this own priest, you know, 
I talking priest, but [indecipherable] this
 little -- that priest
, you know. And this 
[indecipherable] his own busin ess, not th
e business the countr
y, not the business 
nothing, so it™s -- they
 know if there will be democrac
y, they lost the power, they 
lost everything, because of democracy will not accepted the -- the fanatics. 
Q: So you th ink war is all right. 

A: The -- listen, it™s no -- is not another wa
y, no. What -- what you can do another 
way with these people? You -- you not figh
ting, they would kill you to the end, 
what you -- will you wait -- you wait [ind
ecipherable] when you waiting for the 

end? You can not waiting. You -- is coming the mo ment that you have to -- if 

somebody beat you there, you 
have to oh, thank you, be
at me again, thank you, 
beat me again? You cannot stay lik
e this, you have still go against this. 
Q: Well, some people who were involved in
 warfare, people such as yourself, later 
on became pacifists, b u t 
sounds like you haven™t. 
A: I am not a pacifist, you know, the paci
fists they don™t like the war, but the war 
is -- some time you have to -- you have to
 defend yourself, yo
u have to defend 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
62
yourself. And this war, what is -- what you  make United States, this is not the war, 
this is -- my opinion, this 
is defending. This is defendi
ng. This is only defending. 
Q: Have you ever owned a gun si
nce you were in the liberation? 
A: No. No. I using the gun, what for? 
I don™t get the gun. I would like to -- 
someday I would like to go to range and 
shooting, because I like shooting. When 
you see you™re going to some -- some
 -- you know the one, Orlando someday 
shooting, that I take a take a [indeciphe
rable] because I shooting still excellent, 
you know? Maybe not like now because my  
eyes and my hands not so good like 
was for 60 years ago, you kn
ow, but this is -- I shoo
ting to the people you know, 
but now if I have to shoot to th e 
animal today -- today, I would not 
[indecipherable]. I woul
d not [indecipherable].

th
, 2004, Mike Madejski, here we go. You have 
two grandchildren now? 
A: Two grandchildren, babies, two -- two -- twins. 

Q: Boys or girls? 

A: T-Two girls. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074
 
 
 
 
63
Q: Two girls, okay. Wh en these girls grow 
up, if they are in a 
situation similar to 
the situation you found yourself in as a yo
ung man, would you hope that they took 
up arms and they were part of the resistance? 
A: I -- I believe there will be no war because
 there™s -- fighting in the resistance is 
for the patriotist, but this is very difficu lt, is v ery, very risky. I would like there 
would be the peace of the world, and I 
would like that my 
granddaughters would 
have living not in the -- not in the -- worl d will be living in peace. I believe would 
be the wo rld and this would go s -- if they
 -- we did -- I believe we be the peace. 
You know, I did not believe 30 years a
go the communists would fall down. That 
the Berlin wall -- Berlin ga -- mu -- mu 
-- fall down. This everything happened, 
and I believe that th-these people growin
g up the smartest, and the peace will be 
on th e wo rld. I don™t want be -- I would 
do -- like to be [ind
