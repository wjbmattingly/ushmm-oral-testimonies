Silver Spring, Maryland 
 
     
Q: In 1936, he was eleven 1906. Yes, was born 
in 05, ™25.  So she died, she lived not 
long and she died in Leningrad very soon a
nd he did not want a funeral for him.  

He told, this is my mom,  I and my mom 
and my sister who ca
me , this is my mo m 
but not as she left me .  Esta (5) did not want
 to go to the funeral.  He did not want.  
He was no good to her.  So it had to be
 in the late eighties what happened 
between.  Good.  Then when we came back to Leningrad, Mom told about them Œ 

me , because I did not know about them.  You see, we are in a wood forest, in a 

wood.  We  decided to ma ke a picture.  Befo
re we left, it was taken this picture.  
Then times was go and it became, what? It became  closed, not that.  Wh at 

happened, I will not tell you now.  So it 
became  1936, with me  was bad because 
with my work.  I was a psychologist of 
children.  We were ma king biologies (? ), 
it™s called.  Examine the mi nds of child
ren.  We  worked what we knew about, 
what our professors told us how to work
 with them.  But the ma in thing was bad 
for our governme nt.  We  were working w
ith the tests -- the test were from 
America.  Tests, you know what is, tests, 
-- such I say Œ tests -- it was we examine 
the mi nd.  
 

A: Examinations,yeah. 
 
Q: Examination.  It is called 
test, yes?   We worked with that.  It was American and 
one pedologist was called as I was, examine one child from school.  A school 

child and decided he™s ba d to studying became his mi nd is low and he had to be in 

a special school. 
 

Q: This is him?  

 

A: No, he was very smart.  But it is about 
another child I tell you.  Wa it.  About the 
test, about America.  The child was take
n to another school because he could not 
study in a normal school.  His father was a communist in the Communis t  Party.  

Great Communist party in Smela.
  You know __________Sme la.  He was 
working there.  He say why my child is low in his mi nd, no.  It gives the 

psychologist gives the test because he has from America.  Because of these test s.  

The tests are no good.  So he went to Mo
scow and he told the governme nt about 

this.  No mo re for this psychologist, pedologist to work with the children and to 

examine their mi nds.  It must do a psychiat
ry.  Let them a psychiatrist do this.  
This is what I was told.  A psychologist, they can™t teach psychology.  They can 

work in another way but not examine the ch
ildren.  This is why for me  wa s a bad

go to Petrograd because he told I need a 
worker.  I need a helper.  So he was 
helping him a nyway.  In other way what 
father did.  Then what?  
I willcome to my mom.  
In thistime, my mo m™s 
daughter became also grown up.  Be cause it
 was in what time , in 1919, my elder 
sister left.  She became ma ybe she ma rried in this time because she was ma ybe -- 

I don™t know, I do mot know really Œ but sh
e was born as with all my elder, the 
sister from my mo m only.  The first ma rri
age, my mo m.  She  was ma ybe in one Œ 
my eldest sister, I don™t know.  Maybe
 in 1919, no, in the beginning of the 
century, what is it?

A: 1901.  This century is 20
th
 century.  It is what?   In 1901, was born my eldest 
sister.  But she was born, the mother of Benja min.   She was born some  ye ars 

young, elder was she.

99.  She was elder maybe some years 
only.  But to this time , she became grown-up.  She ma rried, at last, you mi ght say.  

She married maybe in 1924 because the chil
d, what this child, he --.  She was 
ma rried and her husband died in three mont hs as she was ma rried.  So she repeat 

the life of her mo m.  Father gone, husb
and died too.  She had this child, three 
months, she was pregnant with him.  Then
 he died and she could not -- she has no 
profession, she could not live.  To this 
time, ma ybe her grandfather died too.  I 
don™t know really when.  She came to her mo m, t o me , to us.  Mom and father.  

He was not her father, he was stepfath
er but he was a good ma n so he took her 
with the child and told my mo m yes, let 
her live with us.  She lived some  years 
with us.  Not much, she came to us only when he was born, in a year.  So she 

came in 1927.  She used to come  but go back.  But when she me t after her 

marriage, she came the first time in 1927.  Because her child is -- he is one year 

  
 
28
with a half, this Benjamin.  One year 
with the help, she br
ought, I think.  She 
ma ybe he died from Œ not ma ybe, she told such.  He was sick with ma ybe 
tuberculosis.  He gave her sickness to her. 
 She became  sick too with tuberculosis.   
In that time tuberculosis was cured not so good as now.  She came, as she was a 

little sick and not so great yet but sh
e brought the child.  It wa s in 1927 and 
suddenly my father has gotten a letter from 
America.  It was the first letter from 
his children, of the first ma rriage is.  It
 was in 1927.  They left in 1910 and ™12.  
So it passed 17 or 15 years.  They became,
 they had business great.  The elterer 
has this great business.  I told you.  Mach
ines.  They lived already, they were all 
ma rried.  They have their fa milies and they live good.  They invited father to 

come  to them.  Maybe I told you about this
.  He went and he had to go to us in 
Petrograd to tell us, to speak with us 
about this.  To go, not to go, how with -- 
about this.  We were all 
studying at the institute, unive
rsities and in

were studying all of them.  I was not yet

I left Orsha in 1924. I came  to Petrograd. 
 The last came I.  I was yet 15 years 
when I left Orsha.  Just I came to that
 school what about what I told you.  My 
sister was studying in the academy and acr

A: High school, yes, gymna sium.  I was not 
in gymnasium, I was in high school.  I

not enter to the university because my 
father was not a worker and they thought
 he was a businessman.  That™s why.  I 
had to go to work for fabric and I was a wo
rker.  In that  time I was a worker, close 
to the working-class.  In ™27 when father
 had to come  to Petrograd, he took his 
wife, my mo m and the child and she did not wa
nt to go without, this child.  That™s 
why she brought him to me and that™s all.
