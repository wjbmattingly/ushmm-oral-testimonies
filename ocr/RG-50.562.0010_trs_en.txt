California. 
Q: And the other aunt a

 Actually, an aunt
 also survived in
 Berlin
. She was marri -
- she was no -- not Jewish. She was married to

 Berlin
, first cousins. 
One of them lives in 
San Diego 
at the mo ment, the other passed away some time ago. 
Q: But the grandparents on your mo th

A: Yes, I would think so . 

Q: Did you have a close 
relationship with them? 
A: They died when I 
was fairly young, sa -- maybe even 
before I went to school, so I 
remember very, very little of them. 

Q: What language was spoken at home? 

A: German. 
Q: Any other languages? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you learn another language at school? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

A: Oh yes, I went to a Jewish school in 
Berlin
, and from day one we were taught two 
foreign languages, Hebrew and E
nglish, and in fact we were 
forbidden to sp eak a word  of 
German during those lessons, was total immersi
on lesson. And after two or three years, I 
was fi -- reasonably fluent in both Hebrew 
and English. So that
™s the time to teach 
children fo reign languages. 
Q: Did you maintain those languages, Hebrew -- 

A: To a certain extent. I mean, I can s
till understand simple Hebrew, and English of 
course, I -- I knew when I came here. 
Q: Tell me about your Jewish day school. 

A: I went to a number of Jewish day schools in 
Berlin.
 The Jewish schools in 
Berlin 
were just fantastic, when I co
mp are them with the day schools in so -- in -- non-Jewish 
day schools in 
Germany
. As the war -- o-or as 
Hitler™s 
power progressed, mo re and 
mo re Jewish boys and girls who origina
lly went to non-Jewish schools in 
Germany
 were 
expelled from those schools, a
nd wer -- had to come to our sc
hool, they were a year or 
two behind us. The standa
rd  of education in  the Jewish schools in 
Berlin
 was j u st 
fantastic. 

Q: What was the name  of your school? 
A: Oh, my  first school was in the 
August Strasse
, then I went to the 
Kaiser Strasse, 
then 
I went to the 
Gross Hamburger Strasse. 
Schools closed, or they bomb ed. So  I went to 
three different schools in 
Berlin
.

Q: And your siblings a
ttended th e same school? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Were they close to your home? 

A: Well, my sister was seven when -- she was 
born in  ™35, so she didn™t go to school at 
all. She was four wh en the war broke out. 

Q: Were they close to your home? 

A: Yes, oh yes, walking distance.  
Q: Your neighborhood, where was that? 
A: I lived in a neighborhood 
that wasn™t -- you wouldn™t call it ex -- exactly a Jewish 
neighborhood, but there were 
a sprinkling of Jews, but mo st of them, of course, were 
non-Jewish. 
Q: So you 
[indeciphera ble]
 non-Jewish neighbors? 
A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: Did you have relationships with  them? 
A: Not really, I think ma -- almo st all of 
my friends were Jewi
sh, and I had no non-
Jewish friends. And I doubt whether my
 parents had any non-Jewish friends.  
Q: Mm-hm. What were your hobbies as a young boy? 

A: I think I was just a good student. I -- I 
loved school. Ho lidays were something that I 
abhorred. And I don™t really have -- don™t 
recall any hobbies I had in those days. 
Q: Did you belong to a youth movement? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
6
A: No. 
Q: Were there youth movements that you were aware of? 

A: Oh yes, there was
 Maccabee, 
there was 
Ha-Koah,
 there were seven Zionist 
organizations. I don™t think I belonged to an y of them. 
Q: Okay . What about your pa
rents, were they involved 
[indecipherable]
 
A: They were involved in the synagogue and 
I was -- and I sang as a boy in th e choir of 
the biggest synagogue in 
Berlin
, located in the 
Oranienb urger Strasse. 
It™s a very 
famous synagogue with its golden dome, and I 
sang there as a choirboy. So I went to all 
the services. My parents didn™t go, only went
 to the services on 
the high holidays. 
Q: And you went every week? 
A: Yeah, because I 
was in the choir. 
Q: How did you get involved in  that? 

A: I think they looked for choi
r boys, the -- the choir looked 
for boys who were interested 
in singing, who were reasona
bly mu sical in the Jewish schools, and I volunteered. 
Q: So 
[indecipherable]
 Friday night and -- 
A: Friday night, Saturday morning. We ofte
n sang at weddings, fune
rals occasio n ally. I 
have very fo nd memo ries of
 my activity as a choir boy. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you playan instrument as well? 

A: I played the recorder and the mouth 
organ, but very  badly, both of them. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. Wh at was the level of religion in  your home?  

 
Interview with Gert Silver

A: I don™t know how you would describe it.
 Probably similar to the liberals here, and 
[indecipherable]
. I thi -- 
Q: The celebration of festivals 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. Well, being in
 a Jewish school we celebrated 
Purim
, 
Sukko t, P esa ch,
 
everything. 
Q: Mm-hm. Your family, however, be
longed to an Or
thodox synagogue? 
A: No, my family also belonge
d to that synagogue in the 
Oranienburger Strasse 
which 
wasn™t exactly -- which wasn't 
Orthodox at all, nor was it Li
beral. It™s probably, if you 
compare it to a synagogue in 
Melbourne, 
it™s probably like 
Charnwood Grove
, or 
Toorak Road. 
Q: Mm-hm. What -- what can you rememb
er about any anti-Semitic incidences? 
A: I remember a lot of them, I mean we were
 very often beaten up
 on walks on our way 
to school or from school by 
Hitler
 youth. And -- 
Q: What -- what -- what -- we™re talking after 1933. 
A: After 1933, betw
een ™33 and ™39. 
Q: Who™s we? 
A: Well, school kids, friends of mine, when
 we walked  home from school, or when  we 
walked to  school, very often there were mobs of 
Hitler
 youth and they just beat us up, 
and nobody came to our rescue. 

Q: How badly beaten? Can you give me some idea? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
8
A: I don™t think we had injuries, but
 they were painful. We ran away. 
Q: Did you fight back? 
A: Always that we were outnumb ered at a
ll times, and none of the bystanders came to 
our help. 
Q: How often did th is happen? 
A: Maybe once or twice a month. I mean, we
 looked out for them, and if we saw any 
Hitler
 youths in the neighborhood, tried to a
void them, but it wasn™t always possible. 
Q: How were they identified as 
Hitler
 youth? 
A: Oh, they had the uniform. 

Q: How old would th ese boys have been? 

A: Probably our age, maybe 
a little bit older, 10 - 11 - 12
. They just did it for fun. 
Q: When  you say you were
 outnumbered, what sort of numbers were they? 
A: Well very often I walked to school with 
tw o friends, and very often there was a dozen  
of them. So we had very little hope. 
Q: Did you report them to anybody? 
A: We reported to that school, but the scho
ol couldn™t do mu ch either. When it happened  
occa -- more frequently than at other times, our
 parents, or one of our parents walked 
with us to school, and that provided  prot
ection. They didn™t a
ttack anybody who was 
accompanied by an adult.  

Q: Did it happen to girls as well? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
9
A: I don™t know. I don™t know th e answer to that question. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you see them often in the st
reet, even if they weren™t involved in -- 
A: Oh 
[indecipherable]
 
Hitler 
youth all the time. I mean, it was a government -- it was 
Hitler™s 
youth movement. They  were proud to show 
their uniforms, so it was part of the 
day to day scenery in 
Berlin. 
Q: What did it mean to you at
 that age, as a y o ung boy? 
A: The enemy.  
Q: So how did that make
 you feel about your home? 
A: I don™t know how to answer that question.
 I -- I felt terribly un
comfortable and fearful 
at times. It wasn™t a very plea
sant experience to grow up in 
Berlin
 after 
Hitler
 came to 
power. 

Q: How did your parents deal with it? 
A: They were equally apprehensive, and to
 this day I will never know why my parents 
didn™t leave 
Germany
. I mean, if I read the literature to
day of how Jews were treated in 
the immediate pre-
Hitler
 period, and after 
Hitler
 came to power, it was relatively easy to 
leave 
Germany
. Why my parents didn™t leave, I w
ill never know, but they were not 
alone, I mean, there were possibly a hundred thousand Jews in-in -- in 
Germany
, maybe 
even more, who stayed in 
Germany
. Many of them thought that 
Hitler
 would never 
attack the German Jews. 

Q: Do you know people that left 
Germany
 at that time? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
10
A: Oh, many of them, I -- many of them here in 
Melbourn e. 
Q: Friends of yours? 
A: Yes. Yes, if I ha -- the signals were so clear, right from 1933 when 
Hitler 
came to 
power, but there was go -- there were going 
to be enormous problems. And why my  
parents didn™t leave, I will never know. I 
mean, it wasn™t always
 easy, reading the 
literature now, to get permits to
 emigrate -- o r to immigrat
e, rather. To emigrate was 
relatively easy in the early years of 
Hitler
. B u t to get permits to 
America
, to 
Australia
, 
to some of the other countries, was relative
ly difficult. I think the only country that 
admitted Jews in un
limited numbers was 
Shanghai
, and I think th e 
Dominican 
Republic. 
 
Q: So the people that you knew that we
re leaving, wh ere were they going to ? 
A: Some of them went to
 England, 
some of them went to 
France
 and were later caught 
in 
France
 during th e war. Many of them went to 
America
, my aunt emigrated  to 
Chile. 
Q: In what year? 

A: Either ™37 or ™38. 
My uncle emigrated to 
Shanghai
, and survived the war in 
Shanghai
, returned to 
Berlin 
at the end of th e war and died there. So  -- 
Q: Natural causes? 

A: Yes, yeah. So it was possible to leave 
Germany
, but my  parents, like so ma ny others, 
obviously to tally underestimated the consequences. 
Q: What -- what comment can you make
 about your standard of living in 
Germany
? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
11
A: We got progressively poorer. I think we we
re middle class when I was a child, and as 
the -- as the economical strains on Jews b
ecame increasingly difficult, I think our 
standard of living became lowe
r. And of co urse, from ™3 9 on, all food was rationed, with 
a special ration card for Jews, and we 
got significantly less food th an -- 
Q: We™ll come to that later. 

A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: So what changes took place? You said 
you got progressively poorer. Wh at -- what -- 
what do you remember changing -- 

A: We moved to, I think lower class residences, lower class districts.  

Q: With your household? 

A: Yeah. Well, we didn™t live in a hous
e, we always lived in apartments. 
Q: Was that your apartment, or rented? 

A: All rented, we rented, I th
ink. I™m almost certain it w as 
rented. And that was basically 
it. I-I know we became poorer, 
although parents normally don™t discuss their financial 
affairs with  their teenagers, their 
-- with their 10 or 11 year olds. 
Q: So 
[indecipherable]
 
A: But don™t forget I was 
11 when the -- when the war 
started, I was four when  
Hitler 
came to power. 

Q: So where did you move to? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
12
A: To the last residence 
that I™ve shown in that 
[indecipherable]
 in a district in 
Berlin 
called 
Weding, 
of all places. And we moved there, and 
that -- it was from there that I was 
deported. 
Q: What happened with school? 
A: Well, di -- the school was close d  
in 1939 at the outbreak of World War 
11
. 
Q: Until ™39, you were at school? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Wi -- were you aware of things 
changing in your ed ucation with 
Hitler™s 
rise to 
power? 
A: No, not really. I think the 
education was -- was unchanged. 
Q: Mm-hm. What about on weekends
, did you have th e freedom to -- 
A: Oh yes, I mean, I w as free in 
Berlin 
until ™43. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: We had to wear the yellow star. 
Q: From what year? 
A: I think from 1941, either ™41 or ™42. 

Q: Mm-hm. Let™s go back to the period before -- 
A: Yeah? 
Q: -- the war starts, before ™39 -- ™33 to 
™39. What other chan
ges took place, if you 
remember them? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
13
A: I don™t think any. 
Q: Increased incidences in 
anti-Semitism, increased -- 
A: Well, as I told you,
 the -- the mob of the 
Hitler 
youth on our way to school and from 
school. Apart from that, no, not really. I me an, there were places 
where Jews couldn™t go 
to. 

Q: Like where? 

A: Parks, primarily. Picture theaters and ot
her venues, but primarily picture theaters and 
parks. There were even benches that -- where 
it was written, Jews are not allowed to sit 
here. 

Q: And the picture theaters of that time? 

A: We™re just not allowed to go. 
Q: Do you remember how that
 affected you at the time? 
A: I don™t think it bothered me a gr
eat deal, as far as I remember. 
Q: Do you remember the eff
ect it had on your parents? 
A: I don™t know. I™m sure they su
ffered, but they 
didn™t show it. 
Q: Mm-hm. What was the atmo
sphere like in your home? 
A: Really it™s too -- I think to a very la
rge extent, unchanged. I di -- don™t think I 
reme mb er any ch anges. My parents, I think, 
tried to shelter the ch
ildren from everything 
bad. So  they  shielded us, I think from many th
ings that they must have been aware of.  
Q: Were you called names in the street? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
14
A: Oh su re, dirty Jew, and that -- that kind 
of thing. I mean, that 
h a pp en ed  ev en w h en  -- 
after we wore the star and we walked in th e street, people out of the blue yelled at us, 
dirty Jew.  

Q: So what happened , as you rememb er it, be
fore the war began, and as it began in 1939 
September? 

A: What period? 

Q: What -- what happened just before ™39? 
A: Well, I had -- I had a normal life, I 
went to school from 1934 to 1939. 
Q: Mm. What happened in ™39? 

A: Well, in ™39 when  the war broke out, the 
Jewish schools were closed, and I had to stay 
at home. 
Q: Do you remember th
e day you were told not to come to school? 
A: No. I think my  parents just told me school 
is finished, school is closed. Bu t I kept up 
my contact with my Jewish friends, and in fact, I was 
Bar Mitzvah 
in 
Berlin 
in 1941, 
two years after the outbreak of Wo rld War 
11
. So there was a Jewish life in 
Berlin. 
Q: Where did you celebrate your 
Bar Mitzvah
? 
A: In a synagogue called 
[indecipherable]
 in the 
Oranienburger Strasse 
[indecipherable] 
existed, was bombed by the allies 
and I had joined a choir in that 
particular synagogue. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
15
A: There were services 
in the synagogues in 
Berlin
 until ™43. Many synagogues were 
closed, but some were opened. 
Q: You said your -- the synagogue th
at you belonged to was bombed. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Was that of any s -- did you see it -- 
A: I didn™t see it, but -- but I didn™t see 
it while it was being bombed, because during th e 
air raids, w e were not allowed to
 go out. We had to go to -- e
ither to air raid shelters, or 
stay where we were. But afterwards, in the 
next morning, I was told, I don™t know by 
whom, maybe -- maybe by my  parents, maybe
 my  friends, that synagogue has been 
bombed. And th en I walked there -- it wasn™t
 a very long walk from home, and saw the 
damage. 
Q: What was the dama ge? Was the whole building -- 
A: Was -- was the -- was the -- it was still sm
oking, and there was very little left of the 
synagogue. 
[indecipherable]
 the synagogue where I was 
Bar Mitzvahed. 
Q: Was there a celebration after the service? 

A: I think it was a family reunion, and friends. 

Q: Mm-hm. Her -- tell me about the air raid.  
A: Well, there were air raids almo st 
from the beginning of ™39 from planes from
 
England.
 There were sirens when
 -- if they approached 
Berlin
. And then initially, I think 
in the early years of the war, we were comp
elled li -- just like the non-Jews, to go to air 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

16
raid shelters. Subsequently, we 
were not allowed to go to ai
r raid shelters any more, we 
stayed at home. 
Q: How often? 

A: Hm? 
Q: How often was there an air raid? 
A: How often the air raids? I don™t reme mb er, th
ey were very often, and they  increased in 
frequency as the war progressed. 
Q: Do you remember the impact
 it had on you at that time? 
A: You became immu ne to it. I don™t th
ink it had any special impact on me. 
Q: Your parents? 
A: If it did have an impact on th em, they didn™t show it. 
Q: They -- after an air raid, 
you would go out of the house 
the next mo rning and see --  
A: And look -- look at the damage. 
Q: -- more devastation. 
A: Look at the damage. See what houses in 
the neighborhood were 
attacked. That™s what 
we did th e next day. No t all the air raid
s occurred during the night, some of them 
occurred during the day in -- in
 broad daylight. And they  ofte
n lasted for an hour or two 
or three, and we went and obs
erved the damage as soon as 
we were allowed to leave. 
Q: Were the streets full of people 
out looking to see what had happened? 
A: Yeah.  

 
Interview with Gert Silver

Q: What were you doing on the day,
 every day, not going to  school? 
A: I stayed at home and visited friends, and read a lot. 

Q: What sort of th
ings did you read? 
A: Everything I could lay my  hands on. I 
borrowed books from the library, from the 
Jewish library. We had quite a -- ra
ther extensive library at home. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And that was 
[indecipherable]
 I did a lot of that. My parents from time to time, kept 
on teachin g me arithmetic, geography, and a fe
w other things that they thought I should 
know. 

Q: Up until what time was your fa
ther working in his business? 
A: When  we were deported in 1943, only my  
mother, my sister and I were deported, my 
father was not at home. And I thought, in f
act, that he had survived the war, because I 
didn™t know wh at happened  to him. And i
mmediately after the war, after liberation, I 
went back  to 
Berlin 
in the hopes that he had survived
 underground, only to be informed 
then, in October ™44, six mont
hs before my  liberation, he was discovered by th e Gestapo, 
sent to 
Auschwitz
, and he died there. So he certai
nly work ed when  we were deported. 
How much longer he 
worked there -- I presume he stop
ped wo rk immediately and went 
underground, because when th
e Gestapo deported a family, 
they put a seal on the door. 
And when my father came home in
 the even ing, he would have
 seen that seal, h e would 
have known wh at happened , and I presume he
 went underground, but I™ll never know.

Q: Mm-hm. What was the food situa
tion up until the time of deportation? 
A: Not very good. We got no
 butter, only margarine. Very 
little fruit, very little sugar, if 
any. No  chocolate, no mo re 
goodies. And that was basically
 the rations. I mean germ -- 
ordinary Germans also had ration coupons, 
but the ration for Jews were significantly 
lower than for the or
dinary population. 
Q: Did you feel hungry at that time? 
A: I don™t think I ever experienced hunger, no. No , my  mo ther was a good co ok, and one 
way or another she always ma
naged t-to prep are good meals. We had some friends, I 
think they mu st have been no
n-Jewish, I didn™t really know 
them, friends of my  parents, 
who occasionally su pplemented our rations with
 a bit of butter and a bit of meat and 
some eggs. I mean, there was a large black ma
rket, and it™s quite possible that my  parents 
bought some food on the black market.  
Q: So your family life, until ™43, until th
e time of deportation was every evening you 
were all home together. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And everybody went thei
r own way during th e day. 
A: Yes. 
Q: What was your mo th er doing?  
A: She was at home, except that
 during the last month before deportation, probably late 
™42 -- no, mid-™42, she went 
to work in a -- also for 
Siemens,
 oddly enough. I think it was

forced labor, because there were
 so many people on the front that the German factories, 
they came to get any labor that they could. And I think she worked 
on the assembly line 
there. So she went to
 work every morning. 
Q: Was that her choice, or she -- 
A: Oh no, no, I™m sure it wasn™t her choice
, I™m sure she was comp
el -- I™m sure it was 
forced labor. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were you aware about the deportations until -- 
A: Yes, very much so because every time I we
nt to s -- not deportation actually, not -- I 
was mo re aware of emigration. I was not aware of deportations at all. But every day I 
went to school, and there were one or two students not there any more. 

Q: This was bef -- this is earlier? 
A: Yeah, this was before the war -- befo re the war, who had emigrated. But of 
deportations I was totally unaware. 

Q: What can you say about your neighbor
s, your German non-Jewish neighbors? 
A: I think th ey avoided us, is probably  the 
best way to express it. None of them were 

symp athetic or anything. I think th ey just avoided us. 

Q: You don™t remembe r anybody o
ffering you assistance, except -- 
A: No, no. 
Q: -- for this food th at you were given, yo
u don™t know who gave
 it to you, the extra 
food. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

20
A: No, no I don™t think that 
we got any help from neighbor
s. But a -- I don™t know where 
the help came from, b u t I know 
that my  parents did get help. 
Q: What sort of help? 
A: Extra food. Butter, which we didn™t get. Meat
, which we either didn™t get, or only in 
very small quantities. 
Q: So your father was in his busine
ss until the time that you were deported 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I guess so. I can™t imagine that he went ba
ck there after he became aware that we™d 
been deported.  

Q: Mm-hm. Did he have Germ
an people working for him? 
A: Yes.  
Q: Are you aware of anything about that -- 
A: No, not at all. 

Q: -- situation? 
A: I know nothing about it. 
Q: Not. 

A: No. 
Q: You said he had a non-Je
wish German lady partner? 
A: Woman 
[indecipherable]
 yeah, yeah.

Q: Do you know anything abou
t their friendship, or business connection, wh at happened  
to that? 
A: All I -- all I know is they were part
ners in business. That™s all I k n ow. 
Q: You didn't know her pe
rsonally, or her family? 
A: No. 

Q: Noth ing to 
do with them? 
A: At least I don™t remember. 
Q: Did you have any hired help from any -- from a German 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No.  
Q: And from what time did you start wearing 
the star? You did mention that earlier. 
A: I think it was either ™41 or
 ™42, I mean that -- that da
te is fairly well documented. 
Q: Yes. 
A: It -- it b ecame a decree, you had 
to go somewhere to pick it up. 
Q: Do you reme mb er the day 
you went to pick it up? Do 
you remember the actual -- 
A: My parents picked it up, I didn™t pick 
it up. And then they had to sew it on the left 
hand side on your jacket, or on 
the outer garment that you wore. 
Q: Did your mo ther sew it on fo r you? 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
22
Q: Do you remember that? 
A: Very vaguely . 

Q: What did she sew it onto? 

A: Onto a jumper, onto a shirt, on
to a jacket, depending on th e season. 
Q: In your -- in your case, what was -- oh, I see, it changed? 

A: Yes, sure, because they -- it had to be sh
own on whatever your ou
ter garment was. So 
in summer it was just a shir
t, in winter it was a jump
er or -- or a jacket.  
Q: Was that significant for you to wear that? 

A: I don™t know how to answer that
 question whether it was significant 
[indecipherable]
 
but it was a matter of fact. I had to wear it 
and that was it. It didn™t cause particular 
trauma as far as I remember.  
Q: What other comments can you make about 
walking in the street, until the time that 
you were deported, up until ™43? 
A: I don™t think I can add to  anything I told  you. 
Q: Did you see any other beatings? 
A: Not that I remember. 

Q: Did you see Jewish  businesses or shops closed? 
A: All I remember, 1 9 38, the 
Kristallnacht -- 
Q: Yes? 
A: -- when the -- ninth of
 November, from memory. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
23
Q: Yes. 
A: The next day, or next days after th
at, I saw  the windows of Jewish businesses 
smashed. Oh yes, that I reme mb er vividly, the 
Kristallnacht. 
Q: You saw it the day after? 
A: I saw it the day after, I wa
sn™t out when it happened. 
Q: Who were you with when  you saw it? 
A: I don™t remember. 
Q: What did you see? 
A: I saw windows smashed, and graffiti,anti-Semitic graffiti. Don™t buy from Jews, 

Jewish pigs, Jews go to 
Palestine
. That sort of thing. 
Q: You hadn™t hear
d of deportation? 
A: Correct. 
Q: Had you heard of anything else that wa
s happening, from a radio, or from newspaper, 
anything that was happening elsewhere, your -- 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: I don™t think it was generally known, and 
if my  parents knew or suspected anything, 
they certainly shie
lded us from it. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember seeing changes in
 your father, the way he looked, the way 

he behaved? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
24
A: Not really, not really. I knew they were 
appreh ensive, but they 
shielded us to the 
extent that they could.  
Q: Mm-hm. And your relationship w
ith your sisters during this time? 

A: It was very good, I loved my sister. 
Q: You said that your grandparents, your moth
er™s parents, died wh en you were small? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were they buried in 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, in 
Berlin
. 
Q: So, can you tell me wh
at happened in 1943? 
A: Well, the Gestapo came with a van and 
told my mother, my sister and me -- 
Q: Came to your house? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you remember when  they  ac
tually entered into your house? 
A: I think so , yeah, but very 
vaguely. They were just -- 
Q: Do you reme mb er how many th ere were? 

A: Two or three. Told  us to go down, take
 some personal belongings with us. We went 
into a fel -- the back of
 a furniture van; there were alrea
dy other Jewish people in there. 
Q: People you knew? 

A: No, I don™t think so. And we were
 taken to an assembly camp in 
Berlin
, which used to  
be a Jewish old people™s home. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
25
Q: How far away from your home was that? 
A: Oh, one or two kilometers. 

Q: Mm-hm. How lo ng did you have
 to pack up wh
at you wanted? 
A: Maybe a half an hour, an hour.  
Q: They waited for you? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What did you take with you? 
A: My mo th er did all the packing, I didn™t 
pack anything. I don™t 
know what she took. 
Q: Did you have your own bag? 
A: I don™t remember. 

Q: Mm-hm. Anything that you rememb er about -- 
A: I think you were only allo
wed to take one item of lugg
age. So what my mother 
packed, I don™t remember.  
Q: You don™t rememb er taking an
ything particular with you? 
A: No.  

Q: So you and your mo th
er and two sisters - - 
A: One sister. 
Q: One sister. 
A: I only had one sister. 

Q: Only one sister -- g o t onto
 the truck, and your father
 was not home at the time. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
26
A: Correct. 
Q: He was at work? 

A: I don™t know where he was, I presume he was at work. 

Q: And do you remember 
sitting in the back of 
the furniture truck? 
A: Yes. That was only a very short jour
ney I took, perh aps 15 - 20 minutes. They 
picked up other people on th e 
way to the asse
mbly point. 
Q: So how many people were in the b
ack of the truck wh en you arrived? 
A: Maybe a dozen . Maybe a dozen, maybe mo re. 

Q: Women and men -- 

A: Yep. 

Q: -- and children? 
A: Yep. 
Q: And what happened next? 

A: Well, we were asked to disembark, and th en a place called 
Grosse Hamburger 
Strasse
, which was assemb ly point, which was be
fore a Jewish old people™s home. And 
there were lots of people there, and we we
re assigned beds in 
the dormitory, and we 
stayed there, certainly 
for several weeks, if not for a couple of months, I don™t remember 
exactly. And mo re people came every day, a
nd mo re people left every day. I guess my  
parents mu st have known what happened to  t
hose who left, but I didn™t. I really didn™t 
know wh at was going to  happen. I had no id ea. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
27
Q: Do you remember wh
at you did every day? 
A: Very little. We read books, we went to me
als. We got -- we were fed well, talked. But 
nothing. 

Q: You had beds? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And bathrooms? 

A: There were commu nal bathrooms and communal toilets. 
Q: You had no idea where your fath er was? 
A: No. 

Q: What was your mo th er like at this time? 

A: She, I think, also tried to shield he
r children from her appreh ensions. We just did 
nothing all day. My mother still went to wo
rk from there during the day. She was allowed 
out. 

Q: By foot? She walked or she -- 
A: No, by public transport 
because her place of work 
was many kilometers away. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So sh e would have taken public trans
port. She came back in th e evening.  
Q: Was she paid for her work? 

A: I presume so, but I don™t know.  

Q: Who was in charge of you during th e ti -- this time? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
28
A: The
 SS
 or the Gestapo. The whole 
thing was run by the Gestapo. 
Q: How were you treated? 
A: Reasonably well. I mean, we didn™t go out,
 we were not allowed out. Nobody beat us 
up. We were -- we just did very little. 
Q: So you were there fo
r a couple of weeks? 
A: No, no, no, at least for a couple of months. 
Q: Couple of months. And then  wh at happened? 
A: Then another furn iture van came, took us to
 a railway station, and from there we had 
to go into a wagon where ther
e were lots of other people, and then  we were deported to 
Auschwitz
, actually to one of the camps, that they called 
hausenlager, 
auxiliary camps 
near 
Auschwitz
, called  
Buna, B-u-n-a.
 But the -- the -- the trip 
was awful, and one of the 
most traumatic experiences of all the war, be
cause we were -- we were so many people, it 
was just like a suburban train at peak hour, 
was standing room only. There were people 
there of all ages, from old peop
le to children as young as we were and even  younger. We 
were perched in there, it was dreadful. 

Q: How long was that journey? 

A: I think 36 to 48 hours.  
Q: And you had to stand all the time? 
A: Stayed in there, and we were allowed 
out once or twice to empty our bowels and 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

29
bladders, but not everybody could wait, so c
ould you imagine the stench in those wagons, 
and during the trip? It was awful. 
Q: Did you have something to eat? 

A: No, no.  
Q: Something to  drink? 
A: No. 

Q: People die on the train? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you see that? 

A: Yes. Elderly, mostly the elderly.  

Q: What were they -- what did they -- what 
did anybody do with th
eir bodies when they 
died? 

A: It was standing ro om only. You know, it wa
s perhaps like -- I don™t know if you have 
ever seen the subways in
 Japa n
 where they  have pushers to
 push people in. That™s what 
it was like. 

Q: So what happened
 when  someone died? 
A: Wherever he is -- I think they were prob
ably put in a corner 
somewhere. I mean, not 
many died, perhaps three, or four, or five. 

Q: Were they taken off at one of the stops? 

A: If -- if it occurred before a stop, yes. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
30
Q: And when you stopped, you were -- 
A: There were lavatories there. 

Q: And you were well guard ed by the 
SS? 
A: Oh yes, it™s mach
ine guns and dogs. 
Q: Did anybody try to escape? 

A: Not to my knowledge.  

Q: So you arrived in -- in -- did 
you s -- how did you know you were in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: I -- I found out later. I didn™t know where 
I was when we -- when we disemb arked. 
But I found out fairly soon afterwards where 
I was. When we arrived, we were asked to 
leave the wagons. There was an 
SS
 man on a podium and they said women an d children 
to the left, and men to the right. And I instin
ctively held onto my  mo ther and joined  her 
and my sister to women -- to the left wher
e the wo men and the ch ildren were. And then  

my  mo ther pushed me to the men. So I think sh
e really gave birth to be twice. Once in 
™28, once in  ™43. My sister and my mo th
er went straight to the gas chambers.  
Q: How do you know th at? 

A: I was told by the other prisoners of 
what happened  to  the wo men and children. 
Q: When did you know there were gas chambers? 
A: Within days of -- I mean, I -- we 
were the last of the prisoners to 
Auschwitz
. Don™t 
forget, it was ™43, so the tide of 
the war had already turn ed ag ainst 
Germany
, and it 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
31
didn™t take very long for fellow prisoners to tell us where we were, and I asked what 
[indecipherable]
 wh ere™s my  mo th er, wh ere™s my  si
ster. They very 
q u i ck ly  to ld  me. 
Q: Was there a good-bye to your mother? 

A: No. She just pushed me to
 the men, and that was it. 
Q: Did you turn 
around to look? 
A: I don™t remember. 

Q: And your sister was with her? 
A: My sister was with my  mo ther, and she was seven years old. Eight or seven. 
Q: So you were now with the men. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And where did you go? 
A: We went to where we shaved
 our heads. We were told to get rid of all our clothing, 
they tattooed numb ers on our lo
wer left arm. And then we 
were assigned to barracks. 
Q: Can I see your number? 

A: Yes, you can if you want to. 
Q: Could you read it out, please? 

A: 107294.
 
Q: You have something under the number, too. 

A: That dis -- dis -- that came later, that wasn
™t the original -- that wasn™t originally put 
there, but it designated Jews. The triangle. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
32
Q: When was that put there? 
A: Subsequently, but I 
don™t know exactly when. 
Q: And what did the triangle mean? 

A: That we were Jewish, because there 
were many Jew -- non-Jewish prisoners. 
Criminals, Communists, homosexuals. So the 
triangle subsequent -- signified that we 

were Jewish.  

Q: Do you remember that -- th
e incident of being tattooed? 
A: Yeah, ve-very vividly. 

Q: Can you describe it? 

A: It was quite painful. 

Q: Who did it? 
A: I don™t know whether it was a 
fellow prisoner or that was an 
SS
 man. I don™t 
remember.  
Q: You remember th e pain of it? 
A: Yes, it was painful. I mean, I think tattoos
 are painful, particul
arly when they are 
inflicted without consideration for 
the person who is 
being tattooed. 
Q: How long did it take? 

A: Oh, a minute or tw o. 
Q: Do you remember what
 it felt like for you to see a number on your arm?  

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
33
A: There were so many new impressions, oc-occurring almo st every day, every minute. It 
was difficult to dwell on any particular event.
 I remember so many events occurring, one 
after the other, it was difficult to 
dwell on one particular event. 
Q: Your barracks were -- were they in -- in 
Buna
, or in -- 
A: In
 Buna
. First of all in 
Buna
, where I worked for about 
two months, just carrying 
cement bags and iron rods 
and so on. And then  I --  
Q: Was it for construction purposes? 
A: Yes, for construction, because I -- they bu
ilt a -- a huge factory, a German industrial 
complex called 
egay Farben. 
Q: What was that for? 
A: They produced 
Buna
 there, 
Buna  
is -- is a gas, or a plastic, and that™s where the name 
came from. And 
egay
 
Farben 
was at that time, the biggest
 German chemical complex. 
But I -- I stayed, luck ily, only two or three months there. 

Q: So the factory being built with -- near the camp where you were --  
A: Yeah, tha -- yeah. 
Q: -- and so you walked every day? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: What were the barracks like in 
Buna
? 
A: They were barracks, and -- 
Q: All men? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
34
A: Yes, only men. 
Q: Can you describe what you rememb er? 

A: I don™t think there is a word in the Eng
lish language that adequately expresses what it 
was like. You can use word s like horrible and 
terrible, traumatic. B u t you can talk about 
the weather that it was horrible or terrible. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t think there is -- is a word that -- an  adjective in the English language that really 
adequately described those -- describes what it was like. 
Q: You were sleeping on bunks? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Was there something to
 cover the wooden base? 
A: There was straw. Straw. 

Q: How many men to a bunk? 

A: I think five, from memory. There were three tiers. 
Q: Were you next to the same  men every night? 
A: I presume so, alth o
ugh I don™t remember. 
Q: You didn™t have any partic
ular bond with
 these people? 
A: No, not really. Not really
. We were so traumatized. We weren't normal, really. We 
fought for our life every day because when  
we came home from w o rk, and we marched 

back into 
Buna
, there was an 
--
 an
 SS
 men standing there, and he decided wh ether you 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
35
were fit to live another day, 
or whether you were so weak that they sent you to  the gas 
chamber. 
Q: That process happened daily? 

A: Daily. Daily after -- 
Q: At the end of the day after work? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Were you lined up? 
A: You weren™t lined up, you marched in co lumn s of five. 
Q: Into your barrack? 

A: Into the camp itsel
f, and then we walked to the barracks. 
Q: So at wh at point did he select people? 
A: As we entered the camp. 
Q: And how were -- how were they selected? 

A: There was an 
SS
 man and -- an 
SS
 man standing on a podium
, and we marched slowly 
past him. It was his decision, life or death. 

Q: What were his words, do you remember? 

A: He didn™t say anything, he ju st si
gnified left or right, left or right. 
Q: To every person, got a direction left or right? 

A: No, not every person, only those who 
-- who had to move to -- to the left.  

Q: That was daily? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
36
A: Yep. Daily after work. But I was only in 
Buna
 for three months. After three months I 
was sent to 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: We™ll come to 
Auschwitz
 -- 
A: Okay . 
Q: -- in a moment. In the -- 
in the barracks there were 
SS
 guarding you all the time? 
A: No, th e 
SS 
were outside the barracks. The person 
responsible inside the barracks was 
a 
ka po
. It was very often a non-Jewish 
[indecipherable]
 a criminal. In many cases there 
were -- some of them were worse than the
 SS. 
Q: Do you remember the 
ka po
 -- the 
ka po  
that you -- in 
Buna
? No. 
A: By and large, I have, either 
deliberately or instinctively tr
ied to put all of that behind 
me, and that was my  way of coping with it. 
Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm. So what work were you doing in the 
factory, carrying cement -- 
A: Carrying cement and carryin g iron rods and steel. 
Q: How many hours a da
y were you work ing? 
A: Probably 10.  

Q: Was the work difficult? 

A: Very difficult for a 14 year old. 
Q: Were you a fit 14 year old? 
A: I must have been. I must have been, I 
mean, we were carrying 50 kilo cement bags 
over fairly long distances. 
How I was able to do -- 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
37
Q: On your back? 
A: Yes, on our back. How I was able 
to do that I really do not know. 
Q: Were you closely supervis
ed while you were working? 
A: Yeah, sure. Particularly when you think th
at we were really underfed for many years. I 
mean, we didn™t start being malnourished wh
en we arrived in the camps. We already 
suffered from shortage of healthy food from 
1939, and now we™re talking 1943. I must 

have been very fit, and lucky. 
Q: Do you ever reme mb er getting into 
trouble for not work
ing hard enough? 
A: No, no. 
Q: You did what you we
re supposed to do. 

A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: And the 
SS
 were guarding you and supervising you? 
A: Yeah, all the time. 
Q: When  did you get fed? 
A: Mid-day. We got a bowl of soup. 
Q: At work? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And what was the soup? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
38
A: Depends where you were in th e queue. If
 you were unfortunate, you got very thin, 
watery soup. If you were luc
ky you were near the bottom of
 the container, and you had a 
little bit more cabbage, a 
little bit more potato, 
bit more solid food. 
Q: Do you reme mb er what it was like going back
 into  the barracks and going to sleep at 
night? 
A: We were exhausted. Went -- went to bed, and slept. 

Q: And how were you wo
ken up in  the mo rning? 
A: First of all the light was switched on, I th
ink at six o™clock in the mo rning, and th ere 
was a lot of noise, people 
yelling, get up, get up.  
Q: Did you have striped uniforms? 

A: Yes. 
Q: And that™s what you wore all the tim
e? What about the personal hygien e in 
Buna
? 
A: We were -- the Germans insisted that we 
were kept clean because they were worried 
about an outbreak of 
disease. So we were regularly de
loused, and watched for fleas and 
lice. 
Q: What was involved in de
lousing? Do  you reme mb er? 
A: I think it was just a question of spraying
 us with something. Probably something like 
Lyso l 
or something. Some chemical. They were worried about the hea lth of the Germans 

in the camp, the
 SS
 and so on, not the prisoners. Bu
t there was very little perso n al

hygiene, I mean, there were no toothbrush es
, there was no toothpaste, there was no toilet 
paper. No ne of the basic things were there. Brush our teeth for years.  
Q: What month was it that you were in 
Buna
? What was the season? 
A: Winter. 
Q: What can you say abou
t the weather, the cold? 
A: Horribly cold. 
Q: Did you have shoes? 
A: Yes.  
Q: What sort of shoes? 

A: Terribly heavy shoes that didn™
t fit, but it didn™t matter.  
Q: Were they shoes or clogs? 
A: Boots, boots really. 
Q: They didn™t fit? 

A: Well, not really, I mean, not what you ex
pect from shoes today. Bu t they were all 
right.  

Q: How did you deal with the cold? 

A: Like everybody else. 
[indecipherable]
 it was just cold, and that was it 
Q: Okay, so you were there 
for, you said, a few months? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And what was the reason for being sent to 
Auschwitz
? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

A: I guess because I was young -- I was one 
of the younger ones, and then I spoke 
German. And in 
Auschwitz
, I was sent to a 
Maurerschule,
 a bricklayer™s school. They  
wanted to  train us as bricklayers to build 
mo re factories and build  mo re barracks. And 
that was an activity that was 
a lot easier thancarrying cement
 bags and carrying rods, so I 
became a bricklayer in 
Auschwitz
.  
Q: Had -- did you walk from 
Buna
 to 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No, no, no. Tell you the tr
uth I don™t reme mb er, but I would imagine that we were 
taken in the truck. Bu t I don™t rememb er. 
Q: Were you aware of a -- of difference be
fore you arrived? Were you aw are of a 
difference between 
Buna
 and 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No. I had heard of 
Auschwitz
, and I knew that 
Auschwitz
 was close by, but that was 
all I knew about it. 

Q: When  did you know that your mo
ther and sister had been sent to 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Fellow prisoners told me what happ
ened to the womenand the children. 
Q: In -- when you were in 
Buna
 you found out? 
A: Yeah, within days of arriving, if not on the day. 

Q: So you knew wh en 
you were arriving to  
Auschwitz
 that it was an extermination 
camp? 

A: Oh yes, sure.

Q: What -- do you remember when you arrived in 
Auschwitz
 what it looked like? Was it 
different to 
Buna
? 
A: Well, to -- we were already prisoners, so
 we -- we had already been  tattooed, our 
heads had already been shaved, 
we already wear -- wore prisone
rs clothing. So it was just 
being transferred from one camp to another. 

Q: Did they look different? 

A: Much  bigger. 
Auschwitz
 was mu ch bigger than 
Buna . 
Q: Did you have contact with other prisoners? 

A: Only those with whom I wo
rked, or who were in the same barracks as I. And I came 
across a number of boys who were at school with me.  

Q: Were you able to recognize them? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: How did it feel having th em -- 

A: We talked to each other. 
I™m still in touch with some of them today. Two live in
 Israel 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What are their names? 

A: The one in 
Israel
 is 
David Zeltz
, and 
Stefan Cohen
. They went to school with me in 
Berlin
, and we met in 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Same age, same class? 

A: I guess so. More or less. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

42
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did it provide you with any comfort? 

A: It was nice to know somebo
dy whom you had known before. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. So wh ere were you trained to become a bricklayer? 

A: In 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Where? On the job? 
A: Yes, on the job. 
Q: Who trained you? 

A: Bricklayers, trained bricklayers. 

Q: What nationality were they? 
A: German, Polish. 
Q: All prisoners -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that had been doing th is work . 
A: Yeah, yeah. Peo -- trained bricklayers wh
o were 10 years older than we were. So, 
professional bricklayers.  
Q: So where in 
Auschwitz
 were y ou doing this? Where 
were the barracks being built? 
A: In the main -- in the main camp  of 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: And how many hours a 
day were you working? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
43
A: Same 10 hours a day, six days a week. 
Q: Sunday was not a day of wo rk? 

A: Sunday was not a day of wo rk. 

Q: And what was Sunday? 
A: Just talked, rested. Tried to
 find out from other prisoners what happened in  the rest of 
the world, because we didn't kno
w how long we would last, how long 
Hitler
 would last, 
what would happen in the end. Because by ™43, 
particularly the second half of ™43, there 
were more and more rumors that th
e tide of the war had turned against 
Hitler
, and thus it 
was only a question of time before the war, before 
Hitler 
would be beaten. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: It was just a question would 
Hitler 
survive us, or would we surv ive 
Hitler?
 But we 
talked about that, we t -- some
times talked about the past, 
the good old times, when we 
were at home, and we had plen
ty of things to eat. And what
 we wo uld do with ourselves 
if we survived.  
Q: Were you hung -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginn ing of Ta pe On e, Side B 
Q: Were you hungry in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Sure, I was hungry all the time. 
Q: How did you deal with your hunger? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
44
A: There was no way of dealing with it except experiencing it, and that was -- nothing 
you could do. If you™re hungry 
you probably get yourself some
thing to eat, couldn™t get 
anything there. You trade food occasionally 
because we were given a ration of tobacco, 

which was called 
[indecipherable]
, was a horrible -- anyway, since I didn't smoke, I 
traded it with smokers for an
 extra piece of bread.  
Q: Did you ration that piece of bread, or you ate it? 

A: I tried and ate it as I could because if I 
kept it for the next -- until the next morning, 
maybe it would be stolen overni
ght. We had some very skillf
ul thieves in the camp. So 
was always good to eat it and not keep it. 

Q: There was no way of getting extra food fro
m somewhere, other th
an that? You didn 't 
know anybody that worked in a k
itchen that might have had access? 
A: No. I know that some prisoners did know peop
le who were in the kitchen, I -- I didn™t.  
Q: Mm-hm. Did you feel that it w as lucky to
 get this bricklaying job, for any reason? 
A: Well it was certainly a lot better than 
Buna
. 
Buna
 was awful. This was a lot easier. 
Q: The work  was harder?  

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Much harder. 
A: The living conditions 
were the same as in 
Buna
.  
Q: Bigger? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
45
A: No, it was -- well, the camp was bigger, bu
t the barracks and th e work ing hours, and 
the -- and all that, were just like in 
Buna
.  
Q: Was there any heating, any fire to get warm? 
A: No. 
Q: So nighttime was cold, going to  be cold . 
A: Yeah, yeah. But di -- you fe
ll asleep, you were exhausted. 
Q: Do you reme mb er the people th
at you shared a bunk with in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: I don™t rememb er any of them personally. The 
worst part of it is if 
you had to get up in 
the middle of the night to relieve your blad
der, then you became 
aware of how cold it 
really was.  

Q: Mm-hm. You had to go out of the barrack? 
A: No, you had to stay in th
e barrack, except that when  the container was full, you had to 
go out and empty it. 
Q: The container? 
A: Of urine, where everybody emptied their bladder.  
Q: And was that the 
only bathroom facility? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: There was no place to wash your face, wash clothes? 
A: Oh, not -- not to wash clot
hes, but ye -- yet there were facilities to  wash your face, 
your hands, sure.

Q: Outside of the -- 
A: Outside. 

Q: -- barracks. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you have a blanket at night? 
A: Yes. 

Q: A woolen  blanket? 
A: It was either woolen  or synthetic, I don™t know. 
Q: One blanket for all -- 

A: Yeah -- 

Q: -- five people. 
A: No, no, no. No, one
 blanket for each.  
Q: Did you have a pillow? 
A: No. 
Q: Straw on the wooden -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How many people wo
uld have been slee
ping your barracks? 
A: I would imagine a hundred, maybe 200. 

Q: Mm-hm. And once again, 
ka po s? 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
47
Q: Do you have an
y  memo ries o f  th e 
ka po s, 
how they  treated you? 
A: They were not very  nice, but I tried to 
have as little as possi
ble to do with them. 
Q: Why do you say they  were not nice?
 You mu st have seen something. 
A: They screamed at people, th
ey hit people. I wanted to avoid th em as mu ch as I could. 
Q: And it was easy to avoid th em? 
A: I guess so. I mean, I successfully av
oided them just about all the time. 
Q: And what about the 
SS
 that was supervising th e wo
rk? Did you avoid them also? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You didn™t get into 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I tried not to attract attention. 
It was the worst thing you could do.  

Q: Mm-hm. Did you see other people attracting attention? 
A: Some people collapsed, some people didn™
t work fast enough. I tried to be as 
unobtrusive as I could. 
Q: Did you form any friendships? 
A: Friendship™s probably 
too strong an  expression. 
Q: Connection. 
A: Connections.  
Q: Just people you discuss things with. 
A: People -- well, sure, people -- the 
boys that I went to school with.  
Q: Do you think you were 
able to show emotion? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
48
A: I don™t rememb er, to tell you the truth.  
Q: So you weren't ever 
beaten in the camps? 
A: I was hit occasionally, but 
not really -- not, not often. 
Q: What were you hit with? 
A: A wooden -- I think a rifle butt. 
Q: Do you remember 
why you were hit? 
A: I don™t know why I hit, but I still have ma
rks of it today. I™m to
tally deaf on my right 
ear as a result of being hit over the 
head. It was the only memory of it. 

Q: And was that instant? 

A: The deafness? 

Q: When  did you lose your hearing? Yeah. 
A: The deafness I think was inst
ant. Luck ily I™ve got good hear
ing on the left ear, so that 
you didn™t notice that I™m half deaf. 
Q: Mm-hm. And was there 
appelle 
in ausch -- 
A: Every mo rning. 

Q: Can you explain that? 

A: Oh, that was a ro -- a roll call,
 and we had to go out and the 
SS
 counted to make sure 
that nobody had died , stayed 
in the barracks, or fled, wh
ich was very rare. But some 
people died overn ight, and th
e numbers had to match.  
Q: How long did the 
appelle
 take? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
49
A: Sometimes only 15 minutes, sometimes was 
a -- was a discrepancy, it could take an 
hour or two. 

Q: And where was that held? 

A: Outside the barracks.  
Q: Every day? 
A: Every mo rning, ev ery evening. 

Q: Were you counted  again wh en  you return ed from work ? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Also in a -- in 
appelle
? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And so what -- what evolved if there 
-- if there was somebody that had died 
overn ight? 
A: Then they went to the ba
rracks to see if th ere was so
mebody in the barracks who co -
couldn™t or wouldn™t come to the 
appelle. 
Th-They -- the 
appelle 
did not end until the 
discrepancy was discovered, wh ether it t
ook half an hour, or an hour, two. 
Q: Who conducted it? 

A: The 
SS. 
Q: So the role of the 
ka po
 was inside the barrack? 
A: Inside the barracks and 
occasionally also at work. 
Q: Are you aware of anybody
 that tried to escape? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
50
A: I wasn™t aware, but I knew th at some people escaped, and some of them were caught, 
and they  were publicly  hanged. 

Q: From 
Auschwitz
? 
A: In front of everybody. An
d all of us had to look -- 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: -- and observe -- we had to. 

Q: When  -- where it was public, wh
ere was it held, the hanging? 
A: Probably at the place wh
ere they look -- where the 
appelle 
was held. 
Q: Did -- you said you saw it? 

A: Yes. 

Q: How many people were
 hung that you saw? 
A: Sometimes as man y  as six or eight, 
I think, sometimes one or tw o. And the 
SS
 
watched that you didn™t close your eyes. But some
how one develops a talent to look past 
it, look -- to have your eyes open in the direction but not to see it. 
Q: Were they people that you knew? 
A: No, not to my
 knowledge.  
Q: During th e day wo rking, did you talk to  people? 
A: Whilst -- whilst -- we had our lunch, we ta
lked to people. And also, if you work  with 
others, you can talk to them. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
51
A: I mean, there were -- I wasn
™t the only bricklayer, ther
e were ma ny of us. And su re, 
you cou -- you could talk to the others. 
Q: Are you aware of any resistance of any kind -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No, not at all. 
Q: Had you heard of resistance outside of the camp ? 
A: No. I was too young. I wasn™t
 a man then, I was a child.  
Q: It™s a -- it™s an unusual question, 
but wh at comment can you make about the 
SS 
in that 
circumstan ce in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Some of the 
SS
 were German, some were Austrians,
 some were Ukrainians. The worst 
were the Ukrainians, the second
 worst were the Austrians, and if you can use the word  
best, were the Germans. If you were surrounded by German 
SS, 
you had a fairly good 
chance to get back 
to work -- back to
 the camp in th
e evening. If the 
SS 
in  charge of you 
were either Ukrainian or Croatian or Aust
rian, the chances were greatly diminished. 
Q: Did you encounter Ukrainian 
SS? 
A: Yes.  

Q: Where? 
A: At 
Auschwitz
. I mean, the 
SS
 -- was a different 
SS
 very often, from one day to the 
next. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
52
Q: Mm-hm. So -- 
A: But you could tell very qu
ickly where they came from. 
Q: Not only by their accents, but they -- 

A: By -- by the -- by their ac
cent, by their treatment. 
Q: Are you able to clarify why they
 -- why their treatment was worse? 
A: I think the -- I think the Austrians are more
 anti-Semitic than the 
Germans. I think the 
Croatians -- I mean, if
 they joinedthe 
SS, 
maybe they  wanted to prove something, I don™t 
know. But every day you had a German 
SS, 
it was good news.  

Q: Mm-hm. The language that you used in  
Auschwitz
 -- 
A: German. 

Q: -- only German? 
A: German. 
Q: All the time, just G erman? 

A: All the time, yeah.  
Q: Did you think th at every da
y could be your last day? 
A: Yeah, ev ery day. Every da
y. At least when I was in 
Auschwitz
. In 
Bobrick 
the 
situation was totally different. But I also ha
d some lucky breaks. One day in the mo rning 
at the 
appelle
, the
 SS
 in charge of the 
appelle
 asked, is there anybody who can speak 
fluent German and Hebrew? I could not
 for the life of me understand why the 
SS 
would 
ask that question, but at that time I spoke re
asonably fluent Hebrew. And so I put my  arm 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
53
up, and also one or two of my  colleagues from -- who were at school with me, also put 
their arm u p . The others went to work and 
we were kept there, 
and we found out why 
they wanted us. It was th
e time th at the Jews from 
Sa loniki 
in 
Greece
 arrived in 
Auschwitz
. And those -- the Jews from 
Sa loniki
 only spoke Greek and Hebrew . They 
needed to be interviewed, they
 needed interpreters. What thei
r name was, when they were 
born, wh at traits, what professions they ha
d. So they needed 
somebody who could ask 
them in Hebrew and translate it in to German. 
So I had a soft job for -- for simply a month 
or six weeks. That was one lucky break I had. 

Q: Where was that 
[indecipherable]
 
A: In 
Auschwitz
, in an office, inside. 
Q: Was the food different? 
A: To tell you th e truth, I don™t rememb
er. It was definitely not worse.  
Q: Were you wo rking lo ng 
hours, or shorter hours? 
A: Sometimes we di -- we just sat to arrive --
 to await the arrival of a transport. We had a 
chair. There were no chairs in 
Auschwitz
. So that was one of the lucky breaks I had in 
Auschwitz
. The lucky break. And then the ot
her lucky break was when I left 
Auschwitz
 
and came to 
Bo brick. 
Q: I™ll ask you that in a mo ment. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: The people that arrived from 
Sa loniki
 and 
Greece, 
did you say? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
54
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did they inform you about anything
 that -- that you hadn™t known before? 
A: No, but it -- what it en
abled us to do is to save some
 lives, because we knew that if 
somebody was asked the question, what was his pr
ofession, that he said I™m a violinist, or 
I™m a teacher, he woul
d probably be 
sent to the gas chambers. Somebody was a carpenter, 
or a locksmith, or a bricklayer, or a welder, th
ey were safe. So very often, a lot of the 
Salo niki
 Jews told us that they™re 
a teacher or a violinist, we translated it as a w elder, or 
as a bricklayer, or as a laborer. 
Q: With their knowledge or not? 

A: Not with their knowle
dge, and not with the 
SS 
knowledge. Becaus
e they didn't  
understand the Germans and the Ge
rmans didn™t understand Hebrew . 
Q: Do you ever remember communi
cating to them in Hebrew -- 

A: Yes, of course. 

Q: -- and telling them something that 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, I didn't tell them anything, I just aske
d them what their name was, how old they  
were, where they were born, wh en and wh at their profession was. So  my  knowledge of 

Hebrew, you could almo st argue, saved my  life.  
Q: Was this towards the e
nd of your stay in -- in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No, it was more or less at the beginning. 
Q: So after a whole month there 
were Jews being brought into 
Auschwit z
 from -- 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
55
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- 
Sa loniki 
and 
Greece. 
A: Yeah. Well, 
Saloniki 
is a city in 
Greece
, and th-there was a large Jewish population. 
So we were all rounded up and a
ll brought together within days. 
Q: Would you be aware of numbe
rs, how many were brought in? 
A: I was just sorry that it ended, a
nd I go back to beco me a bricklayer. 
Q: So you were in 
Auschwitz
 altogether for about a year? 
A: Yeah, yes. 
Q: Which -- did you ever have any contact with women in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No, none at all.  

Q: Were you aware of 
any behavior of the 
SS 
outside of the camp s at night? Any brothels 
in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: There were brothels in 
Auschwitz
, and I believe that some prisoners, 
ka po s
, were also 
allowed to go to  the brothels
 from time to time. But at my
 age, I wasn 't interested. 
Q: Did you know where they were? 

A: Yeah, I -- I saw them from outside. I -- 

Q: But you never fol -- 
A: -- I didn™t e -- to tell you the truth I di
dn™t even know what a brothel was, I was so 
naïve and so young.  
Q: Did you see a factory being built until its
 finishing stages? The completion of it? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
56
A: No, because the brickwork 
was finished long before th
e -- the interior was done. We 
basically built the shells. 
Q: How many sh ells were you in volved  in? 

A: Two, three, four, I don™t remember. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were you aware of the gas chambers in location? 
A: I was aware of their existence, and I was -- I knew where they were, but only from 

being told by others. I pe
rsonally did not see any. 
Q: You didn™t see chimneys? 

A: No. 

Q: Could you smell anything from the gas chambers? 

A: I don™t remember. The gas chambe
r is mainly in a place called 
Birkenau
, and I was 
never in 
Birkenau. 
Q: So after you were in 
Auschwitz
, what happened? 

A: Then there was another roll call, and 
they were asking for young men who could 
speak German and who could re -- who co uld 
read technical drawings. Ag ain, I didn't 
know why, but I put my  hand up. And -- beca
use we had done geom
etry at school. And 
by -- wh en the others, I think, went to 
work, we were taken to a place called 
Bobrick, 
which was a very small camp, maybe 
150 - 200 people, not very far from 
Auschwitz
, but 
run by civilians 
[indecipherable] Siemens.
 And the treatment was significantly better 
than in 
Auschwitz
. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
57
Q: In what way? 
A: The food was better. They wa
nted to make toolmakers of us, because that happened in  
™44, when a lot of people thought the war wa
s nearly at an end, the allied invasion had 
already taken place, and the wa -- they needed 
to train toolmakers, and all the toolmakers 
were on the front. So we were trained as t
oolmakers. We weren't beaten, food was better, 

the accommodation was better. 

Q: The quantity of food? 
A: The quantities were better. 
I think the quality of th
e food was better. Nobody was 
beaten, nobody was 
threatened. They want to teach us.  
Q: Civilians from where? 
A: From 
Siemens. 
Q: From 
Germany
. 
A: Yeah. They were going to
 make toolmakers of us. 
Q: Were they -- so they 
were in civilian clothes? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What -- what was their stations? 

A: There were no 
ka po s 
there. 
Q: What was their stations, the 
civilians? They were working. 
A: Yes, they were running -- 

Q: They were free men. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
58
A: -- they were running the factory.  
Q: And they were free me
n that lived nearby -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- tha -- that was their job? 
A: Yeah. And they were friendly. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So
 Bobrick 
was my salvation. 
Q: You didn™t feel anti-S
emitism from these people? 
A: Look, everybo -- every German
 was anti-Semitic, I mean -- 
Q: That™s how you felt? 

A: Sure. 
Q: So you stayed in 
Bobrick
, you lived there as well? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And where did you train to ma ke the tools? 
A: In the factory. 
Q: How big was the factory? 

A: It was a huge hall, a very large hall. 
How big it was? Maybe 50, a hundred  meters 
long, maybe 20 meters wide. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And what sort of tools were you responsible for? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
59
A: Well, we were supposed to be -- to 
be trained as toolmakers, and toolmakers 
manufacture a variety of tools. 
Q: What sort of tools? 

A: Tools to manufacture ammunition, tools to
 manufacture plumbing equipment, tools to 
make all sorts of metal objects. So we got 
lessons in geometry. We
 were given tools, 
rasps, files, drills. We were gi
ven pieces of metal to drill out 
triangles, rectangles and so 
on. That™s what it -- that -- that di
dn™t train us enough that we were 
[indecipherable]
 
toolmaker. An appren ticeship as a toolma
ker is many years, and I think I was in
 Bobrick
 
probably  for a period of eight or nine months.  

Q: Who else volunt
eered with you from 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Some -- some of the young -- you needed  
to speak German, that was one of the pre-
requisites, because the teachers only spoke Ge
rman. So that was one pre-requisite. And 
you needed to have a -- an elemen tary or 
rudimentary knowledge of
 geometry, triangles, 
squares. That™s al -- I h ad that.  
Q: So how many of you from 
Auschwitz
 came over to 
Bo brick
? 
A: Probably  15 or 20. 
Q: Your friends from school, did th ey co me too? 
A: Yes, and others, yeah.  
Q: How were you transported from 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Like on the back of a truck.

60
Q: Do you reme mb er leaving 
Auschwitz
 and how that felt? 
A: I didn't know it was coming. I was appr
ehensive. But after a day or two in  -- in 
Bobrick
, was a great relief. 
Q: So why did you volunteer? 
A: For th e same reason that I volunteered wh
en I was asked whether I speak Hebrew and 
German. 
Q: What do you th
ink prompted  you? 
A: Maybe the hope for betterment. 

Q: The accommodation at 
Bobrick
, was it -- 
A: Was better.  

Q: Better? 
A: Better. 
Q: In what way? 

A: First of all, there were not so many of 
us, I mean, it was a small camp. There were 10 
or 20 in one barrack. It was a 
lot better than a hundred or 20
0. And the hygienic facilities 
were better. There were toilets -- at 
Auschwitz
 there were no toilets, just empty land. 
And altogether it was significantly better. 

Q: The 
SS
 was still supervising? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
61
A: Yeah, but they had ve
ry little to do with us. We were 
basically, mostly in contact with 
the civilian Germans. The 
SS 
were there to -- I guess to stop people from fleein g, 
absconding. But they were on th e outside, th
ey didn™t take much interest in us. 
Q: Did anybody try to escape? 
A: Not to  my knowledge. 
Q: Did it seem that it was 
possible to escape from there? 
A: I don™t know, I never di
scussed escape 
with anybody. 
Q: You were there for six months? 

A: I was there til the January ™45 -- til the 18
th
 of January, ™45, I remember th at. 
Q :  A n d  th en  wh at h a pp en ed ? 

A: Then we marched for 
some 50 kilometers to 
Gliwice. 
Q: Who? 

A: All of us. 

Q: You were all asked -- 
A: Yeah, to -- to leave for
 Gliwice
. We walked for 50 -- 
Q: Do you -- do you know why? 
A: Well, because -- we were told 
because the Russians were coming. 
Q: So th e 
SS 
rounded you up? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Was this during the day? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
62
A: Yes. So we walked . On the way we me
t lots of column s of other prisoners from 
Auschwitz
, and we walked 50 kilometers. 
Q: And in what period of time? 
A: I asked -- I asked some of my  friends how 
long it took. I think it 
took 24 hours, maybe 
a bit more. 

Q: Did you stop at any stage? 

A: Yeah. Yeah, we stopped occasionally, but 
by and large we walked . 50 kilometers. 
Q: Was that traumatic? 

A: Yes, very, because people
 collapsed left, right and ce
nter, and those who collapsed 
were shot in the head  by th e
 SS
 there and then. So, the great
 incentive to ma
rch on, when 
you saw that. 
Q: How many people 
[indeciphera ble]
 and others, so -- 
A: Yeah.  
Q: -- on the side of the road? Yo
u saw people shot in the head? 
A: Oh yes, many.  

Q: How did that aff
ect you at the time? 
A: Very traumatic, but we kept marching on, ho
ping that the march would end. We didn™t 
really know where we™re head
ing for, and how lo ng it would last. Just kept walking and 
walking and walking. 
Q: Did you assist anybody th
at was having difficulty? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
63
A: Not really, not really. 
Q: Did you have anything to eat or drink? 

A: We took food w
ith us from bub -- from 
Bobrick,
 we were given food to take with us, 
and it sustained us til we got to 
Gliwice.
 
Q: And what -- what was at 
Gliwice? 

A: In 
Gliwice
 we slept in the snow in
 January, for -- we stayed, 
I think for a day or two, 
and then  we were taken in open  wagons to 
Buchenwald. 
Q: Who did you see at 
Gliwice
, who was already there? 
A: Lots of people from 
Auschwitz
, lots of people I guess from other camps, I don™t 
know, and those from 
Bobrick. 
There were many thousands. 

Q: Doing what? 
A: Waiting. 
Q: Sitting around? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And 
[indecipherable]
 open?

A: Yeah. 

Q: In the open? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Was there snow? 
A: Yes, quite a lot. We 
slept in the snow. Then -- 
Q: Were there only older people in 
Gliwice,
 do you rememb er seeing younger people? 
A: Well, there were younge
r people, people my  age. 
Q: Any younger? 

A: Possibly, possibly. I mean, not mu ch younger. 

Q: But there were thousands of people -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: How is it closed off? Was there a big fence? 
A: To tell you th e truth, I don™t rememb er.  

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: It was just an open area. Maybe th
ere was a fence, maybe there was a -- 
Q: Anything significant that yo
u saw there that you can tell us? 
A: No, no. We were totally exhausted. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
65
Q: And your impressio n  was just a -- a mass o f people -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- sitting -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and waiting. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Wa -- waiting for?  
A: For what was going to happen  next.  
Q: What did you -- 

A: You didn™t really know. 

Q: You didn™t know.  
A: Didn™t know. We had no id
ea what was going to happen. 
And then the trains arrived, 
and we were taken in op
en trains and -- thro ugh 
Czechoslovakia
 to 
Buchen wald. 
Q: Do you remember how 
long the journey took? 

A: Probably  a day, maybe a day and a half. 
Q: Were you still alongside your friends from school? 

A: I don™t know wh ether anybody was in my
 particular wagon. I don™t recall that. 
Q: Once again, is this --

A: -- all the time, but not in th
e wagons. In the wagons went 
[indecipherable]
  
Q: So you arrived in 
Buchen wald . 
A: In January, ™45.  
Q: When did you know that it was
 Buchen wald ? 
A: I think I saw a sign, concen tration camp  
Buchenwa ld. 
Q: So what happened  next? 

A: We disemb arked and we were -- went agai
n to a barracks, and in my case I b asically 
did nothing, no work or anyt
hing until three months later 
when we were liberated. 
Q: So for three months -- 

A: Just it -- we had to do no -- we had to 
-- we -- on o -- on occasions we were sent by a 
truck to 
Wymar. Buchenwald
 is on top of a mountain, and 
Wym ar™s
 at the bottom of 
Buchen wald
. We were taken to 
Wy ma r
 to clean the streets, particularly after the city 
was bombed. Bu t that was just about all the work  we did. 

Q: How often di
d you do th at? 
A: Not very often. Maybe 
once a week, twice a week. 
Q: Were you fed in 
Buchenwald? 
A: Yeah, same kind of diet as in 
Auschwitz
.  
Q: How -- can you compare it to 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Compare it to 
Auschwitz
 -- well, we didn™t work, so 
th at was one advantage.  

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
67
Q: Wh-W hen you tra -- on your way to 
Buchenwa ld
, you traveled through 
Czechoslovakia
. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you have any contact with -- 
A: It was one of the very pleasant experi
ences because for one reason or another, the 
opened wagons stopped in 
Prague
 under a bridge and some 
Czechs threw food parcels 
into the open wagons. And the 
SS
 who saw that, chased them
 away and wanted to stop 
them from doing it, so the 
SS 
chased them from left
 to right, they came back on the other 
side and kept putting -- throwing food parc
els and food in to the open wagons. I™ll never 
forget that. Ordinary, civilian Czechs.  
Q: How long did -- so the train stopped under a bridge? 
A: Under a bridge, ma ybe fo r an hour or tw
o and I don™t know why it stopped th ere, just 
happened to stop there. 
Q: So 
Buch enwald
, what was the atmosphere in 
Buchenwald
 compared to the other 
places? 

A: Well, we knew th at the end of
 the war wasn™t too far away. 
Q: How did you know? 
A: We were told by fellow prisoners who 
had access to information that I didn™t have. 
And we were told, just last 
a little bit longer and you will 
be alright. So we tried to 
survive.  

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
68
Q: Do you remember your frame
 of mind in those last three months, knowing that it was 
coming to an  end? 
A: Optimism and hope -- 

Q: How di -- 
A: -- and hope. 
Q: You did live with hope? 

A: Mm. 
Q: Did you feel that it was goi
ng to  be the end of the war? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What was your physical 
condition like at this time? 
A: Very bad. Very ba -- I do 
-- it was okay, and after I left 
Bobrick,
 because 
Bo brick 
was an easier camp, but after 
Bobrick 
and 
[indeciphera ble]
 my health, I think, 
deteriorated significantly. And at the end of 
the war, when the liberation came, I was in a 
very bad state. And I had typhus, but I surv ived it. I overcame it. 
Q: Had you been si
ck before that? 
A: Only  once in 
Buna
. I had a high temp erature. I was sent by th e 
SS
 to have an ice cold 
shower. I was told either you get cured, or yo
u die. I got cured. That was the only time I 
got sick in the camp. 
Q: Did you have -- ever have sores, spra
ined muscles, or  calluses, o r grazes?  

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
69
A: Yeah, but you took those, they were part of
 day to day life, and 
you didn™t even bother 
with them. 
Q: So, can you descri
be the liberation in 
Buch enwald
? 
A: Well, I was in a -- physically in a very 
bad state, and all I knew was I saw sudden ly 
American soldiers in the camp -- 

Q: Suddenly. 

A: Yep. 
Q: From nowhere? 
A: From nowhere and they 
told  us you are free now. 

Q: Where were you wh en you 
saw the American soldiers? 
A: Somewhere in the camp, we were
 walking around. And I was lucky -- 
Q: And he was on foot? 

A: Yeah. On foot and -- 

Q: One sold ier? 
A: No, no. There were tanks w
ith Americans, trucks with Am
erican soldiers, soldiers on 
foot. And I was very lucky, I could comm
unicate with them, I spoke some English. 
Q: What could they  say? 

A: You are free now. 
Hitler
 is finished. The war, for 
you, is over. And then  -- 
Q: How did that feel fo r you? 
A: I was overwhelmed. And they  took
 us, shortly after th ey arrived -- 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
70
Q: What -- wh-w hat did you do immediately? 
A: They asked if we were hungr
y. It™s a silly question. So th
ey took us to some of their 
PX 
depots outside 
Buchenwald
. That™s where the -- the Amer
ican soldiers were fed. 
And, you pick what you like.
 So I, like many of us, we ate butter by the spoonful, and 
washed it down with sweeten
ed , co nd en sed  milk
. That™s when I got really sick . 
Q: Why did you choose that? 

A: My body obviously ne
eded it. I need fat, I needed suga r. That™s when I really got sick. 
Q: After one -- 

A: Shortly after I ate that. What it did to my
 stomachs and my intestines, I never forget. 
Q: Where were you then? 

A: In 
Buchenwald. 
Q: You stayed in the camp? 

A: Stayed in the camp until after the war wa
s over, because we were liberated one month 
before the war was over, and then
 shortly after that I went to 
Berlin 
because I had hope 
that my father had su rvived. Didn™t take me lo
ng to find out that he
 hadn™t. Then I went 
back to
 Buchenwald
. I didn™t really know what to do,
 I had no relative. I was 16 going 
on 17, I was -- I didn™t know 
what to do with myself. 
Q: What -- who looked after you when  you had ty -- typhoid? 

A: A hospital there. 

Q: In

A: I don™t remember h o w long, a 
matter of days, not very long. 
Q: How were you treated? 
A: Very well by an American
 doctor, by a Russian doctor. 
Q: And they  had medical supplies for you? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What sort of medica

A: I don™t remember, I was so weak. And then, in June -- 
Q: So you left the hospital 
and went back to  the camp? 
A: No, the hospital was in the camp, really. 
Q: Yes, you went back  to wh ere you -- to -- 
A: To buch -- yeah. 
Q: And you stayed there until -- 

A: Until I heard there was a notification from 
the Swiss Red Cross th
at anybody under 18 
wants to go to 
Switzerland 
sh ould raise their hands, I did. And in ju -- 
Q: Why did you want to go to 
Switze rland
? 
A: I had always dreamt of 
Switzerland
. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
72
Q: From -- how did you know about 
Switzerland
? 
A: From the time I was at school, I was taugh
t, and also in the camps on Sundays when  
we talked, that people who had money in 
Switzerland
 were able to escape. So I thought 
Switzerland
 was a paradise. 
Q: Were you given other options? 
A: No. I could have stayed in
 th e camp , I could have gone into a displace -- displaced 
person™s camp, but I didn™t need
 any other options, that wa
s the one I really wanted. 
Q: You chose independently, 
you didn™t check to see -- 
A: Oh, many of my friends also  chose the same thing, all the 
Buchenwalder 
picked the 
same thing. 

Q: Picked the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah. So th
en, on the 23
rd
 of June, we arrived from hell to paradise. 
Q: By train? 

A: Yeah.  
Q: What was your first impression of 
Switze rland
? 
A: I couldn™t believe it. Ever been to 
Switzerland
? It™s a paradise. 
Q: What about the feeling of -- of not 
living in fear, frightened for your life? 
A: Didn™t take very long to get a
ccustomed to it. Came very quick ly. 
Q: What did liberation mean to you 
at that time, if you can remember? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
73
A: I don™t know if I can express the feeling 
of relief, it™s probably  the best expression I 
can find. 
Q: And the acknowledgement th
at you had no family, and -- 
A: When I thi -- when I was lib
erated, no, I thought my fath
er had su rviv ed. It was only 
later on that I found out that he hadn™t. And 
then I remembered that I had an aunt in 
Chile
, and subsequently  I found, long afte
rwards, that I had another aunt in 
Germany
, 

and I -- 
Q: How did you find out? 
A: That™s quite a story. You interested in hearing that story? I -- 

Q:

A: Yeah, I -- in ™49, I got married in 
Geneva. 
Q: We™re not up to ™49, though. 

A: No, but that™s how 
I found out, in ™49. 
Q: Okay, we™ll -- we™ll come to that. We™ll ta

A: Okay .

March 30, 2006

People had frostbite.  
Q: Right. 

A: Some people after the war had to ha
ve to es amputated. So mehow I managed. 
Q: The warm weather? Were you -- 
A: It was never that warm that it was unc
omfortable, the cold 
was mu ch  mo re o f  a 
problem than the -- than the warm. 
Q: Did you appreciate the warm weather when 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Sure, sure.  
Q: It made a difference to your well being? 

A: General well being. Also, the days were
 longer, and we preferred the summer to the 
winter.

A: 
Rheinfelden 
was a Swiss army camp, I think, not far from 
Bazen
, where -- that™s 
where we arrived in 
Switzerland
. We were medically examined by Swiss doctors and 
Swiss nurses. And we very -- we were assesse
d. Some people had to go to a sanatorium, 
some people got a clean bill of health, whichincluded me. So then we were sent to a 
rehabilitation to recover, because we were all un
derweight, and we had 
ru -- all of us had 
one problem or another. And -- 
Q: Where was the sanatorium? 

A: Well, I wasn™t in the sana
torium, the sanatorium was in

and where were you all from?  
A: Most of them were Polish Jews. I mean, 
th e number of German Jews in the camp was 
very, very small compared to 
the number of Polish Jews.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And I think in our whole group in 
Switze rland
, there were probably only half a dozen 
German Jews. The rest were Polish and Hungarian. 

Q: Were you able to 
communicate with them? 

A: I learned Yiddish in  the camp, I even learned a bit of Polish in th e camp. Oh yeah , 
there was no problem. 
Q: You™re calling it a camp? 

A: No, I had learned Po lish in the ca -- 
Q: Oh, you had in camp. 
A: -- in 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

A: And well, there was no problem communica
ting. And I had learned Yiddish in the 
camp.  
Q: Yes. So how many people
 were in this home in 
Switzerland? 
A: Maybe a hundred, maybe 150, no mo re. 
Q: In one home? 
A: Yeah. In the -- in the 
villa, in a huge villa in 
Switzerland. 
Q: And you ate meals in this -- 
A: Maybe there -- maybe there can™t have been
 a hundred, there must have been fewer, 
maybe 50 - 60. So me boys who live in 
Melbourn e 
were there. I mean, a fellow who 
works here for you, 
J ake Cheskue
, he was there with me. Ma
ybe his memo ry is better 
than mine. 

Q: And what was your reason for be
ing here? You wanted to stay in
 Switzerland
? 
A: Yes, I never wanted to leave 
Swit zerla n d
 ever. 
[indecipherable]
 be there. 
Q: What were you doing at this time? 

A: Well then we were -- we got career counseling. 
Q: By who? 

A: By so mebody appointed by the Red Cross, or the 
[indecipherable]
 and we were 
examined for 
IQ
, and for what we knew and so on. 
And I think I did reasonably well. I 
was told that if I h-had private tuition for two 
years, I would be able to enter university at 
age 18. And when that fact became known, th e Swiss said, there™s no way. You can™t stay

here for two years to -- to learn and then anot
her six years for university. This is a transit 
situation for you. We give you two alternatives. 
Q: Who -- who gave this to you, th is information? 

A: The Red Cross.  
Q: The Swiss govern ment wouldn™t allow you to stay? 
A: No, I think 
[indecipherable]
 it was the Red Cross. So you have two alternatives. 
Either you can learn to beco
me a carpenter, or you can learn to become a dental 
technician, or you leave. So I chose to become
 a dental technician. 
And so for two years I 
had an  apprenticeship as a dent
al technician, and as soon as 
that was over -- they asked, 
what are you go -- what are you doing about leaving? 

Q: Who™s they? 
A: The Swiss foreign police. 
Q: How did you have contact with them? 

A: Oh, in  
Switzerland
 if you ch ange residence and all that -- I brought some documents 
along with me. Every time you changed address 
you had to have police -- we did, not the 
Swiss, but we had to  have police pe
rmission, and we had to register. 

Q: So fo r two years you were 
learning an apprenticeship? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Where? 

A: In 
Geneva
.

Q: Living where? 
A: My address in 
Geneva? 
Q: What -- what -- what were the conditions? 

A: In a private residence. 
Q: You rented a room? 
A: I rented a room, furnished room. 

Q: Part of a family home? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 family? 
A: Part of a family a p art -- 

Q: A Jewish family? 
A: -- a Swiss non -- no, a Swiss non-Jewish family. 
Q: What was their attitude towards you? 

A: They were very nice. 
Q: Did th ey know your background? 
A: Yes, of course. That -- the Swiss Jewish
 community provided  us with money, on -- 
with a mo nthly allowance, so we could buy clothing. 
Q: Did you have a social life with other Jewish people in
 Switzerland? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. With non-Jewish -- 
Q: With other -- with other Jewish people in 
Switzerland
? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
83
A: Oh yes, a lot. 
Q: Where -- where was that centered? Where did you -- 

A: In 
Geneva
, there was a Jewish  center there that one time or other, I was president of 
the Jewish youth movement in 
Geneva
. 
Q: What was the idea of the Jewish youth movement? 

A: Just for each other to -- to talk, to discu
ss the future, to meet other -- to meet girls. 
Don™t forget we were teenagers, and we were 
interested in girls in those days. Basically 
that. 

Q: Mm-hm. And so how -- can you just give 
a description of wh at y-your state of mind 
was at this time? 

A: Well, I was apprehensive after I finished 
my  appren ticeship that I would be asked to 
leave. And then, by co -- 

Q: But you were happy in 
Switzerland
? 
A: Oh, very, very. As I said, I 
never wanted to  leave. I was quite happy to sp end the rest 
of my life there. 

Q: And did you choose to mix mainly 
non-Jewish -- with Jewish people there? 
A: Yes, yes. Yeah. 
Q: How did you relate to non-Jews? 
A: I had no problem with them. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
84
A: No -- no problem whatsoever.  
Q: Mm-hm.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: What about efforts to 
contact family members from 
S witzerland
? 
A: Well then I made contact with my aunt in 
Chile
. 
Q: How did you make that contact? 

A: I happened to know 
-- remember her address that I wrote to her.  
Q: You remembered it from 
when she left, from when  you were a little boy? 
A: Right from when I -- from wh
en I lived as a child in 
Berlin
, I remembered her address 
and I wrote to her. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And she was very kind to me. She sent me
 money and clothing, 
all sorts of things. 
And I wanted to emigrate to 
Chile
 if I ever had to leave 
Swit zerla n d
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I started to learn Sp
anish in preparation fo r -- 
Q: In 
Switzerland
? 
A: Yeah, for emigratin g to 
Chile
, but in the -- I couldn™t get a visa from 
Chile
, permanent 
residence, so that was out. 
Q: How did you deal with that, was that disappointing? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
85
A: It was disappointing mixed with a sense of relief, at least I don™t have to leav e 
Switzerland
 for 
Chile
. So then alternate choi
ces became available, 
Israel, Australia
. 
And hopefully I could pur -- persuade whoever ha
d to  be persuaded to let me  stay there. 
But I was unsuccessful. Today I am grateful for it. 
Q: Mm. Are you aware of anybody
 that managed to stay in 
Switzerland
? 
A: Yes. I am still in touch with some of them. 
Q: And how -- how were they able to stay? 
A: I don™t know. So me of them had better connections than I did. 
Q: Like what sort of connection? 

A: I don™t know, I think it then was a ques
tion of having the right connections, and 
having perh aps mo re perseverance than I did. 
Trying harder than I did. But, I mean not 
many, maybe half a dozen at the mo st. One 
of the boys with whom
 I was in the camp 
went to 
Israel, 
became very successful in 
Israel
, and then acquired skills that several 
years later were in short supply, and 
Switzerland
 -- was able to get back to 
Switze rland 
to get a working permit, and today is
 a Swiss citizen of immense w ealth. 
Q: What was his line?  

A: He origin ate -- he trained in 
Switzerland
 as watchmaker. When  I trained as a dental 
technician, he trained as a watchmaker, a
nd as watches became electronic, there was no 
future really for watchmakers, because all you 
had to do is change a 
battery. So he went 
to 
Israel
 and started a watchmaker™s school for 
ORT. 
And as there were fewer and fewer 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
86
enrollments, for the same reason, that watc
hes became electronic, he learned something 
else, I think either to repair typewriters or
 to repair something, I™m not quite sure. O-
Optical instruments. He™s a very clever boy. 
Boy, he™s my age. And that skill was in short 
supply in 
Switzerland
, that™s why he applied to the Sw
iss government for permission to 
go back to  
Switzerland
. And he got a job in 
Switzerland
, then established his own 
manufacturing industry there. I saw him just three months ago in  
Switzerland. 
Q: For the purpose of the inte
rview, can you explain what 
ORT 
is. You said he set up a 
school. 

A: He set up a school for watchmakers. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Don™t you know who 
ORT 
is? 
ORT 
is a Jewish organization to train tradesmen. 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: And they wanted to establis
h a school for watchmakers in 
Jerusalem.
 And he was a 
Swiss watchmaker, Swiss watchmaker Jewi sh, so he started it.  
Q: Mm-hm. So 
ORT 
was established after the war? 
A: No, no, no, 
ORT 
goes back long before the war. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: It started in 
Russia, 
I think. It™s a huge Jewish organi
zation. Even today it™s big. It 
stands for, I think, 
organisation po ur la rec
onstruction de travail.
 That™s what the 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

initials 
ORT 
stand for. I subsequently worked for 
ORT 
in 
Geneva
 but we™ll do that on 
Thursday . 
Q: Okay . 
[indeciphera ble] 
take a break. 
A: Enough for today? 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of 
Gert Silver™s 
oral testimony at the
 Melbourn e 
Holocaust 
Museum. Could you continue by telling us
 about your work ing life as a dental 
technician? 
A: Well, I actually only worked as a dental te
chnician for a period of three months. It so 
happened  th at when  the night co urse was comp leted, the person, a Mr. 
Schubert
 who ran 
the course, left 
Geneva
 to return to 
France.
 And as they didn™t have an imme diate 
replacement for him, they appo
inted me to run the course 
for the next 
generation of 
intakes, on a temporary basis. So I worked  th
ere for three months, and then a replacement 

was found. After that, by sh eer coincidence,
 I found a position in a Swiss export/import 
firm, owned by a 
Geneva -- 
a Jewish man called smi --  
Michael Smeedof
, and he wanted  
me because I spoke Spanish. The reason why I 
spoke Spanish, I had to learn Spanish in 
Switzerland
 because I had originally 
intended to emigrate to 
Chile
. And he needed 
somebody who could speak Spanis
h, and because he couldn™t 
find anybody else, he got a 
working permit for me, which wa
sn™t easy. And I enjoyed th
at position thoroughly. It 
really opened my eyes, and I saw there was more to life than fixing people™s false teeth.  

Q: What sort of business was it, what was the -- 
A: It was an expor
t/import business, I -- 
Q: What was their product? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
89
A: -- in textiles mainly. Th
ey exported raw cotton to 
Spain
, had it prin ted in 
Spain 
and 
then sent it to -- sold it to 
clothing manufacturers all over th
e world. And I worked there 
for a number of months until 
they found a replacement fo r 
me, and then my working 
permit expired, and th e Swiss police were again pressurizing me to leave 
Switzerland.
 
Then -- 
Q: In what form were
 they pressurizing you? 
A: Oh, I just got telephone calls and letters
, what -- how are my  preparations going to 
leave 
Switzerland? 
It was a soft pressure. And then I 
found a job at the Israeli consulate 
in 
Geneva
. And at the consulate they were able
 to get a work ing perm -- a temporary 
working permit for me. And I wo
rk ed there, I think probably for six or eight months. 
Then  my  wo rking permit expired, and they  fo
und a Swiss replacement
 for me. That Swiss 
replacement was a young woman from 
Bern [indecipherable]
, and I had to train her 
before I left the position. We go t on so much -- so well with 
each other, that we ended up 
getting married in October ™49, and sh e™s still 
my  wife today after 56 
years. I then left 
Geneva
 -- 
Q: You married in
 Switze rland
? 
A: Ye-Yeah, not -- not straight away. I then left 
Switzerland
 for 
Marseilles, 
because the 
consulate found me a position at the -- at the consulate in 
Marseilles
 from where many of 
the emigrants embarked for 
Israel.
 I worked  there maybe six, maybe nine months, I don™t 
remember exactly. Th
en I returned to
 Geneva
, and in ™49 we got married in 
Geneva
. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

Q: Can you give us some details about 
your wedding ceremony and celebration?  
A: It was a -- it was a ceremony held in the 
Grande Synagogue de Geneva
, a big 
synagogue in 
Geneva
. It was very emotional. Many of 
my friends were there. I had no 
family, but very many family memb
ers of my wife, who had come from 
Bern. 
And -- 
Q: Where was your wife during the war? 
A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: Where was your wife during the war? 
A: Oh, she is Swiss, she was born in 
Switzerland
, and she -- she sta y ed in 
Switzerland 
all her life. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And she™s a Swiss c itizen. And then -- 
Q: Can you explain what you mean
t by it was very emotional? 
A: Oh, I can™t tell you. I think 
[indecipherable]
 and it was probably just a -- a normal, 
pleasant ceremony by the 
[indecipherable]
 
de Geneva
, a man named 
Saffron
, w h o  
passed away only a few years ago. And afte
r that, something even tful happen ed. The 
brother of an uncle of mine had surviv ed as a Jew in 
Berlin
, and he invited my wife and 
me to spend our honeymoon in 
Berlin.
 So we traveled t-to 
Berlin
 -- 
Q: When  did you make contact with the man? 
A: Long before ™49, I found him. 

Q: How did you find him?  

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
91
A: How did I find him, well I had found my  aunt in 
Chile
, and her first husband had 
survived the war in 
Shanghai
, and returned to 
Berlin
 after the end of the war. And my 
aunt told my uncle in 
Berlin
 who I was and where I was. So we made contact with each 
other. 
Q: He -- who contacted who? 
A: I don™t remember. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I don™t rememb er. So an yway, we spent our honeymoon in 
Berlin
, and I walked 
around with my  wife for hour
s, showing her where I was bor
n, where I went to school, 
where the synagogue was where I sang as a -- a
nd also one day we we
nt for a walk and I 
showed her where an aunt of mine had her 
hairdressing salon befo re the war. And as we 
stood there, two German wo men came and aske
d us is there anything we™re looking for. 
So I told her, yes, before the war, my aunt 
had a hairdressing salon 
here. And they said, 
she™s living on the second 
floor. That was unbelievable. So we walk ed up. 
Q: What -- what -- what was her name? 
A: 
Paula Hakker. 
Q: And how was she your aunt? 
A: She was married to 
my mother™s brother. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you have much to
 do with her before the war? 
A: Yes, yes, very much. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
92
Q: You had memo ries of her? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What sort of memo ries? 

A: Oh, I -- I don™t know, just re -- just as ch
ildren. We play -- we pl
ayed with -- I played 
with her two daughters, my  cousins. And -- 

Q: I-I™d like it if you could just relate as mu
ch detail about that me
eting with these two 
German women outside the hairdresser.  
A: Well, they basically -- as
 I™ve told you, they asked me
 whether I was looking for 
anything, and I told  her. 
Q: Were they -- 

A: They were bystanders. 
Q: They were bystanders. 
A: They were bystanders. So I went up there,
 and there, lo and behold, was my  aunt with  
one of my  cousins. 
Q: One of her children? 
A: Yes. She had two daughters, two -- and 
they were -- both dau
ghters were my first 
cousins. One daughter was there 
with my  aunt, the other dau -- 
Q: What -- what -- and her name? 

A: The name of my  cousin ? 
Vera. Vera Hakker
. And the other, her sister, 
Vera™s 
siste r 
Edna
 was at that time in
 Sweden
. The reason why th ey, my  aunt and my  cousins had 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

survived was because my aunt
 wasn™t Jewish. Her husband, my mother™s brother was 
Jewish, and he had perished 
during the war, but she had su
rvived , and so did her two 
daughters. 

Q: She stayed there the whole -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- during the war? 

A: So su ddenly I had two first cousins. 
Vera 
has passed away in the meantime. 
Edna
 
lives in 
San Diego
 in 
California. 
She™s a year older than I. So
 suddenly I had left -- 
Q: What -- what was the reunion like? 

A: Oh, we cried. And 
Vera
 had a son, so I sudden ly had 
a second cousin as well. And 
after awhile we went back, 
the honeymoon was over for -- 
Q: How long did you spend then , in 
Germany
? 
A: A week, I think. Then I went back to 
Geneva
, and I brought my  cousin 
Vera
 to 
Switzerland
. She then got married in 
Switze rland, 
to a man called 
[indecipherable]
 
Templehoff
, and came to live in
 Swit zerla n d
 with her young son. And that son, my  
second co usin became Swiss,
 did all the schooling in 
Switzerland
, became a very high 

ranking officer in the Swiss army , and lives 
there, has two children, who are my third 
cousins. And between his two children, I think 
they have five children, so I have fir -- 
second, th ird and fourth cousins in 
Switzerland
 today, from nothing. 
Q: You™re in contact with them? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
94
A: All the time. I visit them regularly, 
we are in contact by email, by telephone. 
Q: Mm. What sort of contact did you ma
intain with your a
unt who stayed in 
Germany 
after you left? 
A: My aunt didn™t stay in 
Germany
 all that mu ch longer. Her daughter
 Edna
 in  
Sweden
, 
emigrated with her husband to the 
United States
, and my  aunt followed her shortly after. 
She™s passed away a long time ago.  

Q: Mm-hm. Over the years did you go and 
see them, or did they  come to see you? 
A: Nobody came t -- oh, my cous
in came to see me here in 
Australia
 on a number of 
occasions, but I have been to 
Switze rland
 numerous times, and I always visit them. 
Q: At that time in 
Germany
, with this stroke of good lu
ck , did it encourag e you to make 
out -- any other attemp ts at finding other relatives? 

A: Well, I did, but I -- I found out very qu
ickly from the Jewish 
community there that 
they™d all perished.  
Q: Mm-hm. What had your aunt told you, if
 anything, about her perspective of the war 
years in 
Germany
? 
A: I™m not sure that we talked much about it. 
Q: Mm-hm. Was it uncomfortable -- 
A: No, I-I don™t know -- 
Q: -- because she wasn™t Jewish? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
95
A: -- we just talked -- no, no, 
no, no, not at all. I don™t know,
 we may -- if we did I don™t 
remember. I mean, don™t forget , this happened in ™49. 
Q: What had happened to her husband? 

A: He was deported. He was deported, but th
e uncle of the brother of the uncle where -- 
who invited us to have our honeymoon in  
Berlin
, he was marr ied al so to a non-Jewish 
German woman, and he survived. An
d I don™t know whether the name 
Rosenstrasse 
means anything to you. The last Jews to be deported from 
Berlin
 were those married to 
non-Jewish women. And th ey were all one 
day rounded up and put into a building that 
was located in the 
Rosenstrasse
, and the -- their German wive
s arri -- assembled in front 
of the headquarters of that establishment an
d protested day and nigh
t, day and night, to 
release their husband. And in th
e event -- in the end, the Gestapo gave -- g-gave in and 
released them all. And a film has been made of
 that, I don™t know if you™ve seen the film. 
And my  aunt was one of those women in the
 Rosenstrasse.  

Q: Have you discussed that with her? 
A: N-No, no, no. No. She ju
st told me about it, maybe
 I did discuss it with her. 
Q: At that time, when you were in 
Germany 
she told you about
 it, when you -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: My uncle told me, and sh e did. But it wa
s only in recent years, maybe two or three 
years, that a German film producer produced
 a -- it wasn™t a documentary, it was a film. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
96
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: About what the non-Jewish wives 
did to get their husband released. 
Q: What sort of numbers were involved? 

A: I think several hundred. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: If you like I™ll lend you the movie, I -- it was also shown in 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: I have seen it. But for the purpose of th
is interview, is there anything else that -- 
significant that you rememb er your au
nt telling you ab out her efforts -- 
A: No, not really. 

Q: -- at that time? 

A: Not -- not that I remember. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Then we went back  to 
Geneva
 after the honeymoon and we
 found a position in the 
ORT 
Institute. 
Q: Just one mo re question about 
Germany
. 
A: Yeah? 

Q: What was it like for you revisiting 
Germany
, your childhood? 
A: I -- I -- I -- to tell you the truth, I don™t re
memb er what it was like. It was certainly not 

a pleasant experience. 
I™ve been back to 
Germany
 many, many times after the war, 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
97
mostly on business, and partly
 to visit my uncle until he passed away. I don™t -- I feel 
terribly uncomfortable in 
Germany
 to this day. 
Q: Why? 

A: Because of what happened 
to my family and to me. I 
mean, I get a pension from the 
German government, and ev ery year I have to
 go to th e German consulate here to make 

sure -- because I™m under certificate of life,
 that I™m still alive, and I dread that 
experience. I get it over with as fast as I can. 
Q: When  you say you™re not co
mfortable there, is it the local population that makes you 
uncomfortable, or the memories? 
A: Already when I see the 
soldiers at immigration. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I can™t get out of 
Germany
 fast enough. 
Q: What was it like seeing your home? 
A: That was -- didn™t exist any more when I 
got there, it was bombed. So  you could argue 
that if 
Hitler
 hadn™t sent me to a concen tration 
camp , I would probably have been -- I 
would probably have di
ed during the allied air raid bombardment.  
Q: Mm-hm. And your aunt™s 
hairdresser looked the same? 
A: We didn™t go in it, she didn™t own it any 
more at that time, it w as somebody else. But 
that build ing surviv ed th e war intact, and 
it looked as a va -- as I rememb ered it. 
Q: Any other significant landmarks th
at you reme mb er 
that survived?  

 
Interview with Gert Silver

A: No. 
Q: That were intact? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: No. 
Q: Okay, so after a 
week you went back. 
A: We went back to 
Gen e va
, we found a position at the 
ORT
 Institute
 
in a place called 
Arni
 near 
Geneva.
 They needed a 
married couple, one of whom
 was to re -- run the 
administration, wh ich I did. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And one to look after the 
well-being of the students and 
other tasks, which my  wife 
did. And we worked  th
ere for about a year. 
Q: Had your wife received an education? 

A: Oh yes, my wife had a normal education -- 
Q: Normal. 
A: -- in 
Switzerland
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: She was a law clerk. 
Q: Mm-hm. So where were you living in 
Geneva
?

A: At the institute in a place called 
Arni
. It was an institute by 
ORT
 to train teachers, not 
to train students, but to tra -- to train teachers. 
Q: So there was accommodation for the employees? 

A: Accommodation in the institute. 
Q: As well as for the student? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And then  one day -- 
Q: And anything significant that you can tell 
us about the work th at you were doing? 
A: No, not really, not really. 
It was uneventful, except for one even t which eventually led 
us to come to 
Australia
. 
Q: Just before we get there, so rry, where were the students from? 

A: From all over, from 
France
, from 
Belgium, 
from 
Bulgaria
, from 
Holland
. From 
many, many European nations. 
Q: People that had su rvived? 
A: Yeah, young tradesmen who learned to be
 teachers to take uppositions in various 
ORT 
schools throughout the world. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: They didn™t teach tradesmen 
[indeciphera ble]
 the people who got there were already 
tradesmen, to a very large extent.

Q: So what ag
e were they? 
A: 18 - 20 - 22. Se -- many of them were older than my wife and me. 
Q: Mm-hm. Had you discussed any of their experiences? 

A: I™m sure we did, but I don™t remember. 
Q: Okay, so you were starti
ng to tell me about some -- 
A: Then one day we were told th
at some prominent visitors from 
Australia
 would arrive 
to have a look at the institute. It h appened to be 
Leo Fink, Mina Fink
, and their daughter 
Yvonne,
 who was a young girl then. And we got on
 very well with each other, and they  
suggested, why don™t you come to 
Australia
, seeing that you can™t stay in 
Switze rland
 
forever? And th e idea appealed to us, and 
we decided there and then  to apply fo r a 
landing permit to emigrate to 
Australia
. We got it finally, and -- 
Q: After how long? 
A: A matter of months. We had to go through 
health checks and all sorts of things. And 
we left 
Europe 
from 
Italy
 in October ™49, and arrived in 
Melbourne
 on Cup day. 
[indecipherable] 
1950 -- in October 1950 we
 left, and we arrived in 
Melbourne 
on th e 
first Tuesday in Novemb er, on 
Melbourne 
Cup day. 
Q: The other people on the boat w
ith you -- it was an Italian ship? 
A: It was a -- it was a Gr
eek ship, which left from 
Genoa
, the 
Sirenia
, and it was full of 
refugees. 

Q: Did you make friends on the boat? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
101
A: Some friends of ours from 
Switzerland
 were on the same boat, mainly because we 
were -- spent time with each other, we didn™t 
make man y  friends. Acquaintances perhaps, 
not friends. 
Q: All refugees -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- emigrating to 
Australia
? 
A: Mm. Before I left, I visited a man named 
Jack Salmonovitz 
in 
Geneva
, whom I had 
met during my  stay there. He was probably  at 
that time the wealthiest Jew in the whole of 
Switzerland
, and the owner of a very large multi-national firm, with offices among -- in 
just about every port in
 the world including 
Melb o u rn e. 
I visited him and told  him that I 
was going to  
Australia
, to 
Melbourn e
, and if he had a position th
ere for me, I™d be very 
interested perhaps to join 
his firm. So he gave me a letter of introduction to th e 
Melbourne 
office, and I was engaged on th e spot th
ere and then. So I had a job within 
days of arriving here. And I 
worked there fro
m 1950 to 1958. 
Q: What was the name of the company? 

A: The -- the English name was called Gene
ral Superintendents Comp any. The French 
name -- and it was a firm from 
Geneva
, was called, 
Societe Generale de 
[indecipherable]
. It™s a huge firm, nobody knows ab
out it. I™m sure you haven™t heard 
about it, or you. It has a m
onopoly probably bigger than 
Bill Gates 
with 
Microsoft 
today. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver

102
There are very, very few comp
etitors in the field in whic
h they operate. And it was a 
fascinating eight years that I spent there. 
Q: Wha -- what exactly
 is their field? 
A: That takes some time to explain. When ov
erseas buyers, for instance, buy a cargo of 
wheat, or a cargo or iron ore, or a cargo of 
[indecipherable]
 from 
Australia
, they pay for 
it the minute the ship leaves the Australian po
rt, without knowing really, whether the iron 
ore or the coal or the wheat
 correspond exactly to the sp
ecifications that they had 
contracted to buy. They need ed somebody on 
the spot -- the buyer 
needed somebody on 
the spot here in 
Melbourne
 to confirm that. T o  sample the cargo, analyze it and advise 
the buyer, in those days telegra
phically, what the business with 
[indecipherable]
 whether 
the cargo complied with the specifications. And 
only then  did the overseas buyer pay by 
telegraphic transfer. And that firm did that 
for -- throughout the wo
rld, and is today still 
one of the largest firms in 
Switze rland
. Their shares are probably
 10 times as much as 
the biggest banks in 
Swit zerla n d. 
The firm is now quoted on the stock ex change, and 
then the 
Salmonovitz
 family probably have only a sma
ll stake in it. Bu
t it grew into a 
huge firm. 

Q: Mm. Who had started that business? 
A: Mr. 
Jack Salmonovitz
 as a young man wh en he wo rked at the port of 
Antwerp.
 
Q: In what year? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
103
A: I don™t know. That was -- it™s a legend, I don™
t -- I™m not even sure if it™s tru e, there™s 
so many anecdotes going around about that ma
n. But the anecdote that I heard was that 
he was work ing as a port laborer in 
Antwerp
, and he saw flour being lo aded  at one end 
of the ship, and being unload ed 
half an hour later at the othe
r. So he got to th e shipper of 
the flour and says, are you 
happy with wh at™s happenin
g? He says -- the fellow 
apparently  told him, I don™t know what™s happ
ening, but I lose half my  cargo ev ery time. 
That gave him the idea of starting an inspec
tion co mp any. No w, that™s a legend, I don™t 
know if it™s true. There are many anecdotes about him. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: But he was a wonderful man, died 
in his 80™s, and a wonderful family. 
Q: So he wrote a letter for you? 
A: He ge -- sent a letter of introduction to me, to the 
Melbourne
 office. 
Q: And who did you see in the 
Melbourn e 
office? 
A: The s -- the boss. Fellow by the name of 
Falb y, F-a-l-b-y
. 
Q: An Australian man? 
A: An Englishman, actually. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And he engaged me, because a lot of th
e international corresp
ondence was conducted 
in German, and in French, an
d th -- they only had Austra
lian employees, none of whom 
spoke a foreign language. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
104
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So they needed
 me. And I worked there for eight ye
ars, and rose to the position of 
manager, in the end. 

Q: In the same company? 
A: In the same company 
[indecipherable]
. I was really very happy there. 
Q: Where were you living 
wh en you first arrived? 
A: In a rented room in 
Oakley
. 
Q: A room? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: In somebody™s house? 

A: Yeah.  
Q: Somebody Jewish? 
A: No. A friend of mine
 who arrived here in 
Australia 
before me from 
Geneva
, had 
rented that room for me. But we didn™t stay
 there very long, only
 a matter of weeks. 
Q: Who greeted you at th
e port when you arrived? 
A: A number of officers from the Jewish we
lfare society and a couple of friends from
 
Geneva
 who had arrived here befo re. 
Q: Mm-hm.  

A: And they took me to the place in 
Oakley.
 So after eight years at that firm -- 
Q: Did you own a car? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
105
A: I -- I didn™t own a car when I arrived,
 but I was given a co
mpany car in 1956. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And in ™58, I was headhunted  by one of th
e clients of that firm, a Jewish export/import 
firm by the name of 
Heine 
Brothers. It was owned by a man called 
Walter Heine 
who 
hailed from 
Leipzig
, who came to 
Australia
 on th e 
Do nera
, and he start -- as soon as 
possible after the war, he started that expo
rt/import firm. We had 
long before become 
close friends, and I was in -- initially very re
luctant to join him 
because I enjoyed the 
position I had with General Supe
rintendents, but in the end 
I succumbed, he was a very 
persuasive man. I earned a lot mo re there th
an I earned for the Swi
ss firm. And I joined 
him, and I™ve been there ever since. 

Q: Still there? 
A: I still have a peripheral involvement with 
the firm, although not on 
a day to day basis. 
He passed away in 1978 at -- and his wi
dow and his two sons recommended that I 
become the chief executiv
e officer until his two sons, who we
re teenagers at that time, or 
very young, were old enough to run the firm. 
And so I became chief 
executive, chairman 
and chief executive in 1
978, and I progressively retired fr
om the mid-80™s, first of all 
relinquishing th e position of chief executive 
[indeciphera ble]
 executive chairman and I 
gradually retired from there. I still have an
 association with them
, but only marginal. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
106
A: But the tw o men who know 
[indecipherable]
 -- well, the firm in its original state 
doesn ™t exist any mo re, it became  a Merchant
 Bank, which it was eventu ally taken over 
by a Dutch bank that operates in 
Australia
, 
ING, [indecipherable]
 the world™s eighth 
largest bank, I think. We were listed on the st
ock exch ange in th e e
nd, and we were taken 
over. That was it. So the two 
Heine
 brothers, the two young men -- well, they™re not 
young any mo re, one of them 
is already a grandfather, they pursue their own interests 
now.  
Q: What can you say about the local 
Australian population, in the years 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I must say I feel extremely comfortable here. I have, in the course of my career at 
Heine 
Brothers met people in th e highest plac
es, from the govern or general and prime 
minister, d o wn, and met Australians at all le
v els throughout my 
busin ess, and I do not 
think I™ve had one unpleasant expe
rience in all those years. So I™m very grateful that the 
Swiss insisted that I lea v e. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: In retrospect. Now, I™m a Swiss citizen. I c
ould, if I wanted to, go back and live there, 
but I wouldn™t dream of it. 
Q: Mm-hm. So looking back 
you have no regrets coming to 
Australia
. 
A: None whatsoever. And nor ha
s my wife, who is a native of 
Switzerland
. We™re both 
very happy here, and 
we™re happy with the choice we made. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
107
Q: Do you think that your 
effects, the effects of the war, the experien ces that you 
endured, do you think th at that has had an 
effect on you as a pare
nt bringing up children 
in 
Australia
? 
A: I™m not sure that I can answer that ques
tion. I belong to that 
category of Holo caust 
survivors who do not talk to th
eir children about it, for a numbe
r of reasons, first of all, I 
think this was my way of coping with it, not
 talking about it. And 
secondly, it™s really, I 
think impossible for anybody to 
fu lly  co mp reh e nd  wh at h a pp en ed
 there, and I didn™t want 
to burden them with 
the trauma, I wanted them to ha
ve as normal an upbringing a-as 
possible, without being neurotic about wh at 
happened in  the past. Perhaps I™ve done the 
right thing, perhap s I™ve done the wrong th in
g, I don™t know. I mean, my children know 
all about it, they™ve seen the sp -- 
the tape that I -- came from the 
Spielberg 
interview, so 
it™s not that they don™t know about 
it, but we don™t talk about it.  
Q: How do you think th e even
ts shaped you as a person? 
A: I™ve heard that question 
[indecipherable]
 very difficult to answer
 I don™t know wh at -
- what sort of a person 
I would have been, had I 
had a normal upbringing. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I really don™t know how to answ er that. 
Q: Mm-hm. Is there a message that you would 
like to leave to your ch
ildren and to futu re 
generations? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
108
A: Be alert. I think anti-Semitism is rising 
throughout the world. 
We are probably today 
no lo nger target number one, Muslims have ta
ken over that spot. Bu t you never know 
what™s around the corner. I™m a great suppor
ter -- perhaps a one -- the one thing that 
shaped my attitude is that I am a g reat supporter of 
Israe l
. I -- not only have I done 
busin ess with 
Israel
, but I™ve also been chairman and treasurer of the 
Australia
 
Israel
 
Chamber of Commerce. And I still -- and I wa
s a board member for many years -- and I 
still visit them at least once 
a week, and I have a very in tense involvement with their 
activities.  
Q: Do you visit 
Israel ? 
A: Many times. I was there just three or four months ago. 

Q: Mm-hm. For business or for pleasure? 
A: For -- for pleasure, but wasn™t actually
 pleasure. My wife™s brother lived in 
Israel 
since 1948 and he became very 
ill, so we went to visit him, before -- before it was too 
late for him, or for that matter for us. 
Q: Did you take your children to  
Israel
 when they were growing up? 
A: Yes, my children, I™v
e taken my children to 
Israel
, and I think they enjoyed their 
visits very mu ch, and I think th ey 
were very profoundly impressed. 

Q: Mm-hm. Have your children been to 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: With you? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
109
A: No, no, on th eir own. 
Q: Do you know wh at their impressions were? 

A: I think 
[indeciphera ble]
 looked at 
Germany 
as a non-Jewish
 
Australian would, 
without being burden ed by wh at happened to  
their father. I think, but I don™t know. I 
didn™t ask them, they didn™t tell me. 

Q: Did you give your children a Jewish education? 

A: Only to the extent that they went to non-J
ewish schools, but I to
ok them every Sunday 
morning to Sunday sch
ool at the temple in 
Abber 
Road .  
Q: Mm-hm. Can we just take a sh ort break? Ca
n you tell us about your
 Jewish identity in 
Australia? 
A: Well, I™ve always been involved in Jewi
sh organizations ever since I arrived in 
Australia
, and I have only ha
d two positions in 
Australia
, and both were for Jewish 
firms. The 
Geneva
 firm was Jewish owned, and 
Hein e 
Brothers was Jewish owned. I™ve 
never in my  whole life worked  fo r a non-Jewi
sh firm, although the clients of the firm 
were overwhelmingly non-Jewish, and I got 
on extremely well with every one of them. 
So I feel consciously very, very Jewish, but 
I have no problem in de
aling with  non-Jews. 
Q: Did you mix soci
ally with both? 
A: Most of our social contacts of mo st of
 our friends today are Jewish, but we have a 
small number of non-Jewish friends w
ith whom we are very, very  close. 

Q: Mm-hm. What about your children? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
110
A: My children -- my son is
 a doctor, and he lives in 
Castlemaine,
 about 150 kilometers 
north  of 
Melb o u rn e, 
he has a clinic there that employs 
six docto rs and he is very, very 
happy to live in a small place of
 8000 inhabitants with one traffic light. He wouldn™t want 
to live in 
Melbourne 
any mo re. My daughter is a nurse. 
She has four ch ildren. Sh e also 
loves living in small places. She lives in 
Victor Harbor 
in south
 Australia
. Again as a -- 
a place with a population of 80
00 people. She has four childre
n, one of whom is 26, she 
works as a food technologist at 
Nestlé.
 Number two is a paramedic in 
Adelaide
. Number 
three is in his final year of studies of agriculture at 
Adelaide 
Univ ersity. The youngest, a 
girl, 
Emily
 is in her final year at school. My s
on has three children, and they ™re all at 
universities in 
Melbourne
. Two at 
Melbourn e
 University, and one at 
Monash 
University. 
Q: Do you have a lot of contact with them? 
A: Well, with the 
[indecipherable]
 their own lives, but we see them regularly. 
Q: What about the i -- the Jewi
sh identity of 
your children? 
A: My children know that they
 are Jewish, they know all ab
out Jewish customs, they™ve 
been involved in Jewish organizations. My  son in 
[indecipherable]
. My daughter was 
very involved, my son was 
Bar Mitzvah, 
my daughter was 
Bat Mitzvah
. But they have 
both married out. I think their children know
 relatively little about Judaism. That™s 
something I™m not particularly proud 
of, but I™ve learned to live with it. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
111
Q: Did th ey have 
Ba r Mitzvahs, 
the boys? Your grandsons? 
A: No, none of them, no. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. So you say you™re no
t -- you™re not proud of it, it™s -- you™ve 
learned to live with it. 
A: Yes 
Q: Is it something that was -- 

A: Th-There was nothing el
se I could do ab out it. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did they  grow up mixi
ng with Jewish chil -- socializing with 
Jewish children? 

A: No, they -- they went to a -- no
n-Jewish schools. My son went to 
Trinity College
 in 
his final years, and my  daughter went to 
[indecipherable]
 secondary school. And wh ilst 
many of their friends were Jewish, they
 also had many non-Jewish friends. 
[indecipherable]
 since they were at university, somehow, I don™t know, Judaism drifted. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: They found non-Jewish 
partners, and that was it. 
Q: Mm-hm. And is your wife of the same opinion as you? 
A: Yes, I think so. 
Q: So at this stage in your life, do you still 
participate in the celebration of festivals, 
Jewish festi v als? 
A: Sure. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
112
Q: Synagogue? 
A: Yeah, yeah. We had a 
Seder, 
celebrate Hanukah
.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: We go, not every year, to the synagogue.
 We™re still members o f the synagogue. We 
don™t go very often, but o-on occasions.  

Q: And your children and grandch
ildren participate in the Passover 
Seder
? 
A: When they are in 
Melb o u rn e, 
yes, yeah. 
Q: Otherwise, who do you spend it with? 

A: With friends. 

Q: With friends? 

A: Mm. 
Q: Mm-hm. I™d like to ask you, is there -- is 
there a message that you would like to leave? 
I asked you before, but is there anything that -- that you™ve thought of subsequently, to 
your gran dchildren and to futu re gene
rations, based on your experiences? 
A: Well, I don™t talk to them 
about my experiences. I tell th
em very often so mething th at 
my father hammered into me
 when  I was a young child. He said never mind the 10 
commandments, just live after the 11
th
 commandment. I asked him what the 11
th
 
commandment, never do unto others what you 
don™t want others to do unto you. If you 
follow th at, all the other 10 commandments ar
e included in that. Th
at I™ve been telling 
them ad nauseum since they were very
 little. And I think th
ey live by that. 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
113
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I think it™s very important to me. 

Q: You™ve commented several times about the lo
ss of family, and your desire to continue 
and to have your own family. Are there a
ny particular messages you would like to give 
them about family values? 

A: Not really, I mean I got married at 
21 and many people today ask me how come you 
got married at -- at that young age. And reme
mber, I had nobody at 
that time. My father, 
my  mo th er, my  b r o t h e r, my  
sister, they™re all dead, and 
I was intent on starting a new 
generation, a new family. And I™m very glad 
I married when I was 21. I™m very glad we 
had our ch ildren wh en we were 
very young, so that we have 
now lived to see our children 
in -- into middle age. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you do anything to 
co mmemo rate lo st fa mily  me mb ers?  
A: We put the outside candles, and that™s all.  
Q: For your parents -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and siblings? 

A: Yeah, well, not for -- not for -- and actually
 not for my parents, for my wife™s parents 
because their date of death 
was known, they died in 
Switzerland
. But I don™t know when 
-- when my parents died, and there™s no cemetery for them. 

Q: Mm-hm. So there™s no time during the year
 when you would light a candle for them? 

 
Interview with Gert Silver 
 
 
March 30, 2006 
 

 
114
A: No, but I think of
 them all the time. 
Q: Mm-hm. What are the messages that you rememb er from your parents? 

A: I think my parents gave me 
a very good, Jewish education.
 I think they instilled values 
in me that I try and installed in my own ch
ildren, and I have nothing but fond memo ries 
of my  parents.  

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Thank you. Ca
n you tell us about th is photo? 
A: That photo was sent to me by my
 aunt, who had su rvived the war in 
Chile, 
and she 
told me that™s my fath er and me
, when I was very, very young. 
Q: Could you have a guess at 
how old you might have been? 
A: Maybe two years, three maybe
. No more than that. That is
 a picture of my mother and 
my  sister. So that would have been  taken, a
ssuming th at my  sister there was one year old, 
she was born in ™35, so that 
photo would have been taken in
 1936, 70 years ago. Amazing 
that it survived. We are worried
 about the longevity of tapes.
 That is an article that 
appeared in a Swiss newspaper, on the day, or after the day of our arrival in 
Switze rland
 
on th e 23
rd
 of June, 1945. 
We arrived from 
Buchenwa ld
 and the article, in the German 
language, describes basically how we came th
ere, why we came there, and basically a 
little bit of background that we
 had all spent time in a co ncentration camp, and that we 
came to 
Switzerland
 for recuperation. This is a phot
o taken by a press photographer in 
Switzerland 
on our arrival before we disembar
ked from the train, also on the 23

almost certain that I am the person who has 
his hat out of the wi
ndow on th at photo. 
Another photo taken on the 23
rd
 of June, 1945, this is proba
bly, at least as far as I™m 
concerned th e mo st precious one, because three 
of the boys who are on th at photo, except 
the one on the extr
eme left, came to 
Melbourn e
. The two on the right, 
Jack 
[indecipherable]
 and 
Montek Akerfelt
 have regrettably passed aw ay in recent times, 
and 
Joe Baker
 is still very much 
alive, and a very prosperous businessman in 
Melbourne.
 Another photo taken on th e same -- on 
the occasion of our 
arrival. The only 
person I recognize on that photo is 
Moneek Freidman
 who is the boy on the extreme 
left.  

Q: Okay. One here, one here. 

A: Ah, here. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Again a photo taken by the press photograph
er. Regrettably, neither I nor any of the 
persons whom I have consulted, know the 
name of that person. That™s my wife, 
Rifka
, 
and we™ve been married now fo
r 57 years, and hopefu lly it™ll 
last. This is my daughter 
Ruth, 
her son
 A n th ony
, her daughter 
Emily
, her son 
Ada m , 
and her son 
Da niel. 
These 
are the three children of my son. This is 
Elizabeth, 
this is 
Jeremy
, this is 
Rachel.
 All of 
them students at 
Melbourn e 
University at the moment. Th
is is a document confirming 
my  status as a refugee. This is a diploma 
confirming that I have successfully comp leted 
my  appren ticeship as a dental technician in

document issued to me after th
e war in 1946. This was issu
ed by the Swiss government. 
Until then, I had no documentati
on whatsoever that I existed,
 or who I was. This is a 
passport photo of me, taken in 
1946, 60 years ago. You can tell the difference. This is a 
travel document, issued to 
me by the Swiss govern ment in
 1947. I needed it because it 
was the first time I left 
Switzerland
 for 
Berlin
 to visit my  uncle. This photo is of my  son
 
Denny
. He lives in 
Castlemaine
, about 150 kilometers n o rth of 
Melbourne. 
He™s a 
medical practitioner by profession, but a very dedicated and enthusias
tic musician, and at 
the mo ment he is the director of the 
Melbourne
 Mandolin  orch estra. You asked me 
earlier whether I recollect th
e interview by Professor 
Boder.
 That interview took place, I 
believe in August 1946
, approximately 14 months after my  arrival in 
Switzerland 
from
 
Buchen wald . 
During th at period, and in th e month af
ter that, we were interviewed almost 
on a week ly  basis, by the Swiss govern ment
, the Swiss Red Cross, Swiss newspapers, 
Swiss radio stations, Jewish organizations in 
Switzerland, America, Canada, Australia
 
and 
South America
. We averaged, as I said , about on
e interview a week and I really do 
not recollect that particular interview. 
Q: Thanks very much.
