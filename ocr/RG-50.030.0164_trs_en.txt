STEFAN MOISE 
April 4, 1991 
 
 
Q: Please tell me your name . 
 

A: I must...Moise, Stefan. 

 
Q: Please tell me where 
you were born and when. 
 
A: I was born in the city of Iasi on January 30th, 1923. 

 

Q: I'd like you tell me  a few words about your childhood and ____ to tell me  some thing 

about your family when you were a child. 

 

A: My parents...my father was a guitar player, 
used to play in different restaurants. As a 
child I had to learn how to play the vi olin becau
se I had to help my family, and my mother, my 

mother wasn't  working and we only lived from what
 my da d used to bring home , so I also used 
to accompany my dad in restaurant s and play so we
 could support our family. When I was a little 
older, I left...I didn't play with my da d any 
longer and I started playing with another younger 
chap and we played in restaurants to 
ma ke a living. And I played the violin. 
 

Q: Where did you learn how to play 
violin and where did you go through school? 
 

A: InIasi . 

 

Q: Did you have any problems with children 
in the neighborhood or did you get along with 

them? 

 

A:  Around my house, everybody we
re our people. We used to 
play together and we were 
friends. We  did really not have ma ny probl
ems as a child. No, not at that time. 
 

Q: Mr. Moise, tell me  a little 
bit about what happened with you 
and with your fa mily when 
the war started? What did the war mean for you? 

 

A: The beginning of the war...first of all, I 
could no longer make a liv
ing. All the restaurants 
closed down and I had no place where I could pl ay. I had to work to find di fferent jobs, jobs 

which I didn't  really know how to do. Forinstance, to work in a ________ all kinds of 

agricultural work that I was  not 
really qualified for, but I could 
at least make a living and I think 

_____ till the war crossed the River _____. The tr
oops went on the other side during the 
beginning of 1941. In the beginning of 1942 and by th
at time a few more taverns opened up and I 

could at that time still find a few jobs playing the 
violin, so at that time I could still make a few 
bucks that way. 

 

Q: When did you get ma rried? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164

A: I got ma rried in the beginning of February
 1942, after my parents died. My dad died in 
1941. My mother died right afterwards in January '42, 
a year later. I was left alone with my sister 
and I had to go ma ke a living. I didn't know what to
 do with my little sister
. I used to leave her 

with the neighbors but still when 
I took her home, she told me that
 they had beaten her up, they 
didn't feed her even if I did pay fo
r her keep and they kept her for 
a night or several nights, I used 
to pay them to keep her un
til I returned from my work. 

 

Q: How old wa s the little girl? 

 

A: She was six years old. Maybe
 five, six. And she used to complain about it...they'r e 

beating me  up, they didn't  feed me , they scream
 at me . And t he neighbors told me  that since I 
was eighteen years old, look for a girl, get ma rrie
d, so your wife would take care of your and you 
should care for your sister. There's no other solu
tion. For sure you will not be able to ge t by 
yourself because your brothers are gone but you 
have no relatives to 
help you. Nobody will help 
you, so get ma rried and then your wife will take
 care of you and of your
 sister. So in the 
beginning of February I found some  r eally ni ce people who are the pa
rents of my wife. 
Some body took me  there and we agreed and we got
 ma rried and indeed when I came  home , at 
that time we  didn't have radiators.
 It was a private home. We used 
to heat it with wood. I used to 
put the lights on, and I used to come  home  and fi
nd food on the stove, a littl
e heat. My sister was 
taken care of. Some body was there 
to take care of my sister. 
 

Q: What happened afterwards? 

 

A: So later I used to go to the city to pla
y. I used to ma ke a living because I had a home 
where I lived with my wife and my s i ster. 
 
Q: Just keep talking about it. 

 

A: Shall I tell you directly about the war? 

 

Q: Yes...whathappened. 

 

A: In September  _____ February, March, April,
 May, June, July...we ha
d a quiet life in my 
own home . I had no problems. On Se ptember 15th 
at one o'clock in the morning, the police came 
to our house and they told me  to get dressed. Th
ey asked me  what's your name . Moise. This is 
my wife. This one is my sister
. Alright...get dressed and pack up 
your luggage. I didn't even have 
time to consult with anyone. Nobody could explai
n to us what was going on, why they were 
taking me  away, so whatever I could find around I 
put in a blanket, wrapped up their blanket, 
took it on my back and they took us at a commi
ssary headquarter and there there were other 
people and they took us to this school, th
is school out on _____ in the town of _______.  
 

Q: And who accompanied you from home  to the commissary and to the school. 

 

A: The police. The police. At the school was al
so guarded  by the police. Probably it mu st 
have been pre-arranged because there were policem
en when we came into the school. Maybe it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164

was a school or a former synagogue...I don't reme mb
er. So anyway, all night long until in the 
morning, they kept bringing in people from Iasi, gyps
ies. At a certain pointthey used to call our 
name and take us to the cell a
nd they used to take information...ask us information about our 
address, the parents, where I was born...so anyway 
they filled up all kinds of for ms. There were 
ma ny many people. And we stayed there ma ybe about
 two days, until they finished the for ms for  
all the people. After everything was done, they fo
rmed s mall groups and they took us to the train 
station in ______. There there were 
trains waiting for us, freight 
cars, empty. They were freight 
cars, yes. We  had to climb into the cars. We  we re 
too ma ny of us in a car. At least we were very 

crowded which found our little pl
ace and we stayed in these fr
eight cars ma ybe another day, one 
night, in the _____ train station unt
il they brought other trains from
 other parts of the country, 
also a train full of gypsies. They attached those 
newly arrived cars to ours
 and the trains left. 
Whenever train stops we were allowed to get 
out just for our  basic needs. They would 
occasiona lly open the doors. We  could get off, just for a little time  and we kept going until we 

crossed the River _____, but it t
ook a while. Then we crossed the _____ River and even then 

they would open the door at times so we coul
d go out. Maybe they gave us some  wa ter too...and 
then we crossed the River ______ and we arrived. 
Whenever the train would stop, we arrived at 
the place where we could see Ode
ssa (ph), not close by but far awa
y, at least different uh suburbs 
of Odessa. On the left, so that the car was on th
e right on a secondary rail.
 In front of us were 
some military people, some soldiers. The soldiers were not doing anythi ng. They did not have 

any kind of military exer cises. They just st ayed
 there doing nothing and there were some  ditches 
near them, a nd the soldiers, th
ey...we stayed in our cars and we
 stayed there from morning...I 
don't know exactly what time, but we
 stayed there until evening, ma ybe three, four, five in the 
afternoon. The soldiers did not leave. They r
eceived food. We  saw that
 because there was a 
_____ right in front. They just st
ayed without doing anything. As soon as the me chanic engineer 
of the train gave the signal for 
the train to leave, we boarded th
e train again and we saw that the 
soldiers left  as well.  
 
Q: Who used to guard the train? 

 

A: The soldiers. They were sold
iers, dressed in khaki uniforms. 
 

Q: What happened later? 

 

A: We went through Odessa. I don't reme mber 
all the name s of the train stations. After 
Odessa we were closed into the cars. We  c
ouldn't see any name s. When we arrived at _____, 
there we all had...many of us had to get out of th
e train and we had to ma
rch in a column to the 
small train, the train that w
ould go, not _____. Probably it con
tinued to _______. It was not a 
train that could climb mountains. So
 there were trains there, but th
ey brought some  carts and they 
took some  of the luggage, some  old wome n and ch
ildren, and put them in the carts, but not ma ny 
of them. Most of us had to walk and we walked
 and we walked from morning till late, late at 
night, ma ybe until around one in the morning. We
 ma rched on without any food, any water, just 

a few stops along the road. And so we walked ma
ybe till one, one thirty. We  used to stop...then 

we stopped on the right and on the 
left sides of the roads and we rested until morning. Maybe 
they were afraid that since it was dark, we would run away. So we slept along side the road and 

in the fi el ds until morning. In the morning we star ted again, and we marched and marched and 

around two in the afternoon we arrive
d at this farm, _____ Pe trosky (ph)...

Q: I would like to ask you so mething. Tell me how were the conditions during the march? 

 

A: Very, very hard. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t it. Was it a long column ? 
 

A: Yes, very long. There were military guards, Romanian guards. 

 

Q: Was it police or gendarmes?  

 

A: They were gendarmes or military people. They were dressed in costumes (ph). There 

were ma ny, ma ny peopl e. Some time s you'd rest 
and there were many who would come from 
behind, from the back of the column. How shall 
I say...they would rush to come  so they could 
rest for a longer time  because  those who were at
 the beginning, at the head of the column, would 
rest a little longer. The ones in 
the back, until they arrive to sit 
down, then we had to start all over 
again, so all these people 
from the back would come  to sit with us. They told us there was a cart 
with a rifle behind us, so we guarded on the right,
 on the left  by these sentinel s but there was an 
arme d cart behind us, and we arrived at ____ Petrosky, so... 

 

Q:  Excuse me all the time interrupting 
you, but on this road, you are thirsty, you are 
hungry... 

 

A: Don't even me ntion that. We  were just a
bout bursting. It was September which is very 
hot. The sun was burning. We  woul d go by wells, by 
running water, brooks, rivers...we were not 

allowed to stop to drink. We were
 not allowed to drink anything. No
t even a drop of water till we 
arrived in ______ and no food. No. 
No food. We  arrived in _____ Pe
trosky and there when we 
arrive d, there was a _____ full of water from wher
e the cattle would drink. We  filled ourselves 
on this well and drank some  wate
r. We were left out there in 
the field and we no longer saw any 
soldiers or no one whatsoever. We  were just left
 alone without any guards, no one to talk to us. 
 

Q: What did they tell you before they left? 

 

A: Nothing. Nothing. They just le
ft, left us there alone without
 telling us anything. We  just 
stayed on this field. On the right there was a ston
e quarry or a stone mi ne. There were some  pits. 
How should I call them...pits, you know, stone  pits, 
no longer in use, so all we could see was the 
place, you see, open pits. And we just stayed 
there on the field. When it rained, we would go 
down the quarry. And we just stayed there on th
e fields until Nove mber
. Some  people already 
started to die off. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

A: From starvation and diseases. The f
ood, two hundred grams of flour, oats flour... 
 

Q: How were we given this? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
5 
 
A: They singled out some body to represent ea
ch city, a group of the city, a delegate who 
would represent Iasi or another 
town. They would go this town 
nearby and they would bring the 
flour back and he divided it. We  had a box, a tin
 box like...but the flour wa
s not really processed. 
It was rough. So he said that each person w
ould get about two hundred grams, which was a full 
cup of that tin, two hundred grams per person. A fam
ily that  had five people, who'd get five cans 
____ and you couldn't really pr otest. You couldn'
t do much with this flour and occasionally 
you'd get two or three potatoes too. Excuse me . 
A cup of porridge and potatoes, and that's  how 
we survived, until it being fall, ther e were fi elds
...they had harvested the fi elds but on the fi eld 
were left some  cobs of corn, a few kernels of 
wheat, and we'd go and pick them up, but we were 
afraid because if they caught you, nobody...we were 
afraid. We would come  back. So very few 
of us dared to go. So they'd rather die with th
e family than go out to pick up these leftovers. 
 

Q: Why wouldn't  they come back from the fields, if they'd go pick them up? 

 

A: There were these delegates I would call 
them who were going on these horse-pulled 
buggies. They were arme d. They would patrol an
d if they found you on the fields, they would 
shoot you, or they would take you and you'd neve r come  back. 

 

Q: Were they Roma nians or Ukrainians? 

 

A: They were not Roma nians. They were not Roma nians, no.  

 

Q: And they were in civilian or uniform?  

 

A: No, civilian. And meanwhile as we stayed 
in the fields, we were very upset, hungry, full 
of diseases. Three me n arrived, three young me n, and th
ey gathered us there and told us that they 
came from Bucharest. They came to send you back
 to the country. We  came as a delegation...we 
have an authority. We received an order from Bu
charest to send you back to Roma nia, but if you 
want to go back to Roma nia, the country doe
s not have any money so you must pay your own 
expenses back from Transnistria to what
ever your home is. Can you ima gine that. Anybody 
gives the shirts off their back or anything just 
to go back. We  didn't have much but whatever we 
had, we put together and gave it to these young g
uys. They had some  ma r ks with them. Whoever 
had marks or golden earrings from women, weddi
ng bands or ma ybe nice bl
ankets or whatever 
special or valuable we had, we gave to thes
e young me n. They took everything and ma de a list, 
and they said wait, that  the offi cial de legate and we will come back. We 'll go to pay for the 

transpor tation. We 'll come back to pi ck you up, 
and you will leave. You will go back ho me , each 
of you to your own home. You can imagine how happy we were. We  waited and waited and 

waited and never saw them again. Not to toda
y. They saw everything. They saw how ma ny we 
were, just about there, and they took the last
 penny we had. They took the last hope which you 
just sold for a piece of bread or a potato. There wa s _____ we sold anything for, but anyway...we 

stayed at this farm with our two hundred gram
s of this flour and not
hing else...nothing, nothing 
else, and occasionally we  got these two potatoes 
per person, and we stayed there until November. 
In late November, other people came and took us to __________.  

 

Q: What did they do there? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
6 
 
A: We found out later they 
emptied this _______, a village. There were some  very good 
home s built of stone, good roof, good fences, very
 good quality homes but empty. There was no 
food in there, no fire, nothing. When the people 
evacuated, they took everything with them, so 
they took us there. There were homes  with two ro
oms, with three rooms and they packed us in 
these rooms. They were so full that you coul
dn't even move a r ound. All you had room is to 
stretch out to sleep and a little 
path to go out to the hall. There were so many of us  ____. And 
this representative, this dele
gate who was old and probably he
 knew more about these things, 
started to give us this flour again, two gram
s pe r head and we stayed there, hoping to be 
repatriated to Bucharest so we stayed ther
e till ma ybe until February, March, 1943. And again 
somebody c ame to say the order came from Buchar
est that you go back to 
Iasi, that the trains 
were waiting at _____, at _______. They are waiting 
for us. Again it's cold weather. Everybody 
let's go. We  hardly had anything else with us. Ev
erything that we had we 
sold for potatoes, for 
bread. We  had really nothing, so during the nigh
t they took us and we started again ma rching 
about two days to return to the station in 
_____. There, you can imagine what happened on these 
two days on the road. It was cold. The children 
were naked, without shoes, without food. In the 
train station, the guards surrounded us. Where 
are you going?  Why did you come  back?  We ll, we 
heard this and this. No. Nothing 
is true. Go back. There were ol
d people who said well, if we 
have to go back, we'll just di
e on the roads. It's cold. We  are hungry. Then they thought about 

sending us to ______. In ______ we...these people arri ved at the station of the gendarmes and 

somebody, probably the mayor...I 
don't know who...then said w
hy did you run away from _____. 
You had homes there, and you ran away, because we don't have a place to put you up. All the 

people who leave here from Roma ni a who are 
here, we don't know where to put you up. Go 
back...or we don't know what to do with you. One of
 the people I reme mber of the places was a 
barn ______ which was just being built, was 
st ill in construction. It was being  _______, no 
windows, just the outer walls, no 
doors, no roof, just ground on the 
floor, bare ground, and that's  
where they took us. But this would be our home.
 We have no other pl ace to put you in. We  were 
even happy with that. At least we were pr
otected from _________. They showed us, some body 
from the village, are going to find some  straws
. We put them in the window places and in the 

door places and on the roof to pr
otect ourselves, so we built this
 protection. And each of us took 
a little place on the ground. We  alre
ady knew how to do this, and we 
stayed there also with this 
two hundred gram of flour. It was not...probablywas a practice everywhere
, even in the larger 
villages. That is what they
 distributed probably everyw
here, because ____________. We would 
have liked to work. We  ask to have some  jobs
. In ______, I went to some fisherme n to see if I 
could work with them, to ma ke a little living. 
I wa s just idle. I was young. I wanted to work. 
Others wanted to work, not really for money but
 to work for food. Anywa y, no, we couldn't. No, 

nobody gave us any work. Nobody talked to us. They didn't ask us who we were and even there 

people started dying. In the morning whenyou would wake up, you saw your neighbor dead. 

And the guy who distributed the rations, the flour,
 must have heard some thing and ran away. He 
took his wife and in the morning when we we
re waiting for our flour, nobody bring it. He ran 

away. When we heard that...when, you know, wh
en you are so desperate and you are in a 
situation and some body who is a little smarter
...at least we thought he was smarter...when he 
leaves you, we lost all hope. We  just thought th
at this guy who had been more capable than 
anyone ran away, then we thought that we were really
 gone. It is the end of 
us. We  stayed a little 
longer. We  chose another chief who'd find the flour
, but people really st
arting to die, ma ny of 
them. My wife told me  that, you know, I was a 
strong ma n. If I had stayed there longer, I mi ght 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
7 
 
die too ______, so my wife told me  like this...go, run away, run, even if you don't succeed, you'll 
die some where but... 

 

Q: Don'thurry. 

 

A: Can I have a little water please? 

 

Q: Don'thurry. 

 

A: I didn't believe I would start crying. 

 

Q: You probably saw this again. Just sit qui
etly. Drink water. Wipe your eyes. We 'll 
continue whenever you want to. (Pau
se)  So what did your wife do? 
 

A: Go. If you escape, be careful. Let me relax 
a little longer. (Pause)  I didn't believe...I 
really didn't think I would be like this. 

 

Q: It happens. Don't worry about it. Mr. Moise,
 you are there, with your
 wife and with your 
sister... 

 

A: Yes. Yes. My sister was near my wife. They
 were just dressed in 
very light clothes that 

they brought from home . They had _____ her shoes.
 She was barefoot. We were in wretched 
conditions. We hadn't c ut our hair...I was thin, cl
ose to...so she tells me , I don't want to see you. 
Go, and if God willing you come  out  alive...(cry
ing)...take care of me  
and of your sister. We  
borrowed from a woma n some slippers made of ra
gs and they were two sizes smaller than my 
size, so they didn't even fit but I was happy. I tied
 them on my  feet with some  rope. M y heel was 
kind of hanging out but anyway I 
put some  rags around my fee t . I took my violin with me . I bid 
farewell (pause - crying)...so I bid farewell to my si
ster and they left ther
e and I thought that it's 
probably the last time I'm going to see them again, 
that I'll never see them
 again. I knew what I 
was going to leave them because I knew where 
I was going to go, but I didn't know whether I'd 
get there or if they would survive. I left. I 
cut through some  fields. 
You had to ma ke some  
detours, and I arrived at a 
train station. ____ already. Back 
at the station ____ there was no 
longer like before. How shall I say...empty. I me an
 there were ma ny, ma ny people, ma ny soldiers 
and they didn't  notice me when I arrived there.
 I was with another guy. 
Nobody really noticed us. 
It was dark too and the train was there al
ready. The train probably came from ____ or 

some where. This train had some  freight 
cars and also some  cars for, you know, third 
class...people's  cars, passenger trains. I had my 
violin with me . I didn't leave it there, and the 
other fellow had a guitar. We  boarded the long, 
long car. We  got on. We  stayed there in a little 
corner. The train left and we left with it. We
 went and went. They didn't open the doors. Nobody 
asked us anything. We  just kept to ourselves.
 At a certain point, it was ma ybe after mi dnight 
already, the door opened. There wa
s no light, not even in the trai
n stations. It was complete 
darkness. The door opens to the car, and some ...the
y start loading some  ba
gs with wheat, with 
corn...I don't know what they were. They just loaded
 car freight with these bags and then  far m 
workers who had loaded the bags, got on too, and th
ey just sat on the bags in the darkness eating 

_____. We  were like inthe 
corner. In the morning when dawn came and they saw us...hey, this 
is...down with you. So they must have been Russian
s, but probably they were afraid too. Who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164

knows. Down with you. I took my violin. He took hi
s guitar. We got off t h
e train when the train 
stopped at the next station to _______, some thing like 
this. I just have this sounded the name  of 
the town in my ear...and we went quickly to a passenger car. There we
re wome n who were going 
to the ma rket to Odessa and they had all kinds
 of goods to sell there. They knew who we were 
and they hid us in near behind their baskets and we
 stayed there until Odessa. In the train station 
in Odessa, we got off. We looke
d left. We  looked right. Nobody was 
there. Just a soldier, a guard 
at the door. Near that station, th
ere is like a zoo or some thing, ma
ybe a garden, a park. It had an 
iron fence in front and a little 
gate and near the gate was this
 guard. We  s a w the guy, had I think 
a mark or some money, gave it to
 the guard in his hands, and we 
entered into this park. There 
were several sculptures there,
 some  statues. I don't know who they were. We...anyway, some  
statues. And we kind of hid behi
nd those. There were some  bushes and we just hid there and my 
fellow said, you stay here and I'll go in the stat
ion. Let's see where we can go. Maybe I can find a 
Roma nian railroad worker from Iasi because Roma
nian trains would arrive to Odessa. Maybe I'll 
find a Roma nian. Let's see what we can do. If we 
ma naged to get all the way here, maybe we can 
get away from here, because in Odessa if they
 saw you in the station, they would arrest you, we 
know. 
 

Q: Whathappened? 

 

A: The week before, one guy ran away. Also
 a guy from ____ who was a violinist, a young 
ma n without any fa mily. He was by hims elf or
 who knows...maybe his family was someplace 
else, but he was alone. He ran away to Ode
ssa. Maybe he knew that some body in _____ where 
he was from...I told you that...from the town of _____ or ______ and _______ so ma ybe a long 

time ago had some body who had worked with this 
Roma nian who was the owner of a restaurant 
in the Hotel Passage (ph) in Odessa. The street
 Ki ng Michael the First, something like that. So 
this ma n, what did he do. He dressed this violinis
t a little better. He was kind of light hair. He 
was not that obvious that he was dark. He had so
me  docume nts with the logo of the hotel, and 

everyday in the station in Odessa
 he tried to find a musician to
 take into the hotel, to the 
restaurant of the hotel. He wa
nted a Roma nian musician and he was looking for them in a 

station, because most of the musi
cians who were playing in the 
restaurant in the hotel were 
Roma nians. So they would send him to the statio
n in Odessa to find these people who ran away 
from the camps, to see if he could put together
 small orchestra, and luckily my colleague found 
this fellow. We kind of knew each ot her. He 
aske d would you go with me. We  have no time to 
talk about it. Do you wa nt to come ?  Yes. And _______, you used to know ______. OK. Let's 

take _____. Let's go. We  got onto the streetcar an
d we went to the Hotel Passage. Nobody knew 
me . The owner didn't know me , but this chap fr
om _____ wa s already there for a while, gave me  

a key, gave us a room. That night we didn't play
 because  we were really...looked terrible and 
this was a good restaurant, a big 
restaurant, so the next day the 
old  ma n who had distributed the 
food before, to us the flour, was there. I saw him th
ere. So we  met there. It was a small orchestra. 
There was a trumpet player, also picked up in th
e train station in Ode
ssa, and I found a comb. I 
combed my hair. I ma naged to pull myself together
, and the next day I aske
d for an iron from the 
girls who were working there at
 the hotel. I cleaned myself up, 
but my head...hair it was just 
long. Anyway, the next night, that's  how I played, w
ith my feet in rags, unshaven. I don't...in this 

restaurant, I don't now reme mber how much th
ey paid us, how ma ny ma r ks we got every 
evening, because they paid us right after the show
. And so I made a few marks that night and the 
owner gave me some money. I play
ed the second night the same  
and I put together some  money

and I went to the ma rket, to the bazaar and I 
bought some  shoes. I bought a shirt. I went to a 
bath, a public bath. I went to a barber. I still reme mber today what the barber said, that he found 
some  bugs i n my head. Of course who coul
d have washed hims elf for weeks ____, so I 
reme mber today how I was in the barber's 
seat. The barber must have told to his 
colleague...parasite...parasite
. I realized that he must have f
ound a bug in my hair, but anyway he 
didn't kick me  out. He c ut my hair. I went to 
the bath. I took a bath. I 
shaved and by now I had 
my ____. I had a place to sleep but I didn't have
 any peace in my soul because I knew where I 
left my wi fe and my sister. I used to cry all th
e time . The girls who work
ed in the hotel saw me 
cry all the time , but I didn't tell anybody wher
e I came from, only the people who were around 
me . One evening...so here, here in the...we played
 Roma nian folk music at this hotel. Many 
people who came to eat, they were Ro ma nians who were comi ng back fr om the front, pilots, 

officers. And I still play Roma nian songs. Wh
en they heard the pilots, when they heard 

Roma nian music, the Tr ansnistria governme nt
 departme nt ______. There were Romanians there 
too in that area. They were working for 
the governme nt, young me n who would come  in the 
evening and take me to their rest
aurant after I'd played, and I'd go 
with them. They would take an 
accordion player, a guitarist, and we would go with them and play for them a little longer, and 

they'd bring us back. But in my soul I was not happy. I know I had food. I had a bed, but I wasn't  

peaceful. One evening, there was a bi g banquet,a dinner, and who gave it?  A colonel, a 

Roma nian one with his fa mily. He was there, an
d hearing that there's Romanian folk music at  

this restaurant, he...that's where he decided to ha
ve the dinner. We  played. I didn't drink. I was a 

young ma n, but who knows what I did that evening. Th
ey fed us too. I had two or three glasses 
of wine. I started crying. And I had this boldness th
at I said I just can't continue on like this. I 
have everything I need here...food, drink, mone
y, whatever money, but can I do anything ___ 
this evening. Can I do anything tonight. If not, I'
ll go back to my wife. I saved all the money. I 
kept it all with me . I didn't s moke. I didn't 
drink. I would only ma ybe buy a  little some thing. I 
wanted to save the money and to keep my promise.
 So I went to the colonel. I said mi ster, I'm 
from Iasi. And he thought that we had been hire
d by the owner directly from Roma nia, that we 
had our papers. I went to him a
nd said, Colonel, do you want to help me . Yeah. Tell me . I 'll help 
you. I am ________. My fa mily is in...what's the name of the place...not in a camp but where I 

just left them, before _____. Anywa y, I have my  si
ster and my wife there. I promise that I'll 
bring your wife here. And I held 
to this promise, but afterwards of three days, I almost thought 
that they would arrest me , and escort me  out. I saw the colonel was not comi ng back and I 

realized that I was in problem. Meanwhile, two i
nvalids from the war from Iasi came  there. They 

had tried to go by train to Iasi, Odessa...I don't 
know why they came, but they could travel by 
train. They heard that's Roma nian folk music. 
They were curious to hear. They came  to the 
restaurant. One was from my 
neighborhood, from Iasi. _______ was 
his name , an invalid from 
the war. Wh en he saw me, hey__________, do you want to go home . I can take you home . I said 

leave me  here. Here, I'll give you the money. You 
go and take my wife fr om such and such a 

place, and from there we'll go back to Iasi. Now I 
can't  right now because I now have business in 
Odessa but you come  ba ck with me  to home . I'll try to take you to Iasi. I'll come  back here with 

another delegation and I'll bring your wife. Of co
urse, he didn't  come  back. He was probably 
doing some  business on the train. I don't know what
. Anyway I took my violin and I decided to 
go back. Maybe in Iasi I have ma ybe more possi
bilities to do some thing. 
I got back on a train. 
My other Roma nian fellow also, and the others st
ayed in Odessa. Before getting on the train, I 
started crying in the restaurant where I was wa
iting for the train to come . Maybe somebody at the 
table ne xt to me ...because I kept telling this guy th
at I stayed here...I'm le aving my sister. She's 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164

staying here...my wife...ma ybe they'l l die here. 
I'm going to go back. He was afraid, this other 
fellow, that some body's going to hear us and arre
st both of us. I was decided to go back by now. 
Anyway the train came. We boarded the train. We 
took the instrume nts, the 
violin and the guitar, 
to the passenger cars. It was ma ybe a rapid or a fast
 train, and in the area between the trains there 
was some  room for the guitar, for the violin. We  
didn't have a ticket so we kind of hid there so 
we wouldn't  get caught, and we 
went till we got almost at ______. 
 
Q: Let's stop here. 

 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

END OF T APE 1  

 

Q: We 'r e on the train, on the way to  _____, yes? 

 

A: Well, I couldn't hide anymore because 
I was caught. The guy who was checking the 
tickets and a gendarme, a military man...I don't know what ____ he was. He was in a military 

uniform. He  was not an officer 
but a lower...maybe a ma jor. Ah, he says...I've been watching 
you. I've been looking for you. From Odessa I've b
een trying to find you in the train and finally 
found you. We got arrested, both of us. And be
tween these passenger cars...before those doors 
some cars especially for prisoners that they 
were transpor ts. There 
were thieves and other 

criminals, and they were transporting in a specia
l car. They took us to put us in that car. My 
companion was older. He  had already done hi
s military service. He told me, _____, get your 
money out and let's give it to them. So, Mr. Ra du (ph), I was left with
 nothing. Everything I took 
out...I don't know my companion had 
anything left, but I tell you, I wa
s so afraid. Everything that 
I had saved to save my family, I gave to this so
ldier and we put it in the pockets of the soldier. 
He didn't say anything. He didn't take us to the 
car but he left us...he let us stay on in the 
passenger car on the corridor. He
 pretended to talk to us, until we arrived in _______. In ______ 
he kind of disappeared. I don't know 
whether...I seem to re me mber he kind of took an oath or 
promise...I don't know...anyway we got off the 
train and we crossed the train station. The 

restaurants were open or these pub
s, these taverns, in _____ and ri
ght away, we just crossed the 
street to go into one of these re
staurants. We  found the instrume
nts. We t ook them and we went 
into the restaurant. We  were...there was nobody in
 the restaurant. The owner asked us, did you 

come from the restaurant  across the street, be
cause probably the other owner had ordered the 
Romanian to send him s o me musicians. He said
 don't you want to play for me . Why not, we say. 
He takes out a piece of white pape r, a blank sheet, and he writes up a cont
ract between the two of 
us, and here we leave our instrume
nts there. I had quite an extrao
rdinary violin. It was worth ten 
times more than the advance he gave us. So we le
ft the instrume nts there, but we wanted to have 
some  money with us so we left the instrume ntsthere. We  said we'll go to the train station and 

wait for the people who are comi ng from Iasi to pl
ay and we will start playing that  night. He 
gave us an advance but obviously the restaurant
 owner knew what quality 
violin I had. Anyway, 
we went to the station and this we were wa
iting and hiding until a train ar ri ved. We got on a 
train. No problems. The r e were passenger cars. We
'd go from one car to another. We  crossed 
_____. We  arrived at the _____ River at
 this border...what's the name
 of it...this border town... at 
____ with a border crossing. We  qui ckly got off the 
train because they we re really checking the 
documents at that time. We went into the rest
aurant and we stayed th
ere near a table. Nobody 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
11 
 
asked us anything. We  were there 
like two patrons, standing. When 
the train signaled departure, 
we got out of the restaurant. It was the _____ rest
aurants at the train station. We  got back on the 
train and right away ______ close to 
Iasi. We arrived in the train 
station in Iasi. My companion 
got off and the gendarme or border officer...Idon't know who...grabbed me . My companion still 
had some of the money that from the advan
ce and gave him a hundred 
____, ma de of a me tal 
coin, monies which...anyway put a hundred ___ to this
 chap and he let us go. And I went to his 
home with him. I stayed there about two days
. Then I went to my for mer neighborhood. You 

can't  imagine when her mother saw me, my mo
t her-in-law saw me , that I came without her 
daughter. You can imagine. She fainted. I promise 
that I'll go back and bring her back. Anyway, 
she really didn't look with good eyes at me , like al
most accusing me that I left her daughter and 
ran away. I told her that I came here so I coul
d go back. I told her who brought me  he re, although 
this ____ didn't lift a finger for me . He didn't tell
 me  ma ybe if I hadn't had any mone y, we would 
have even been arrested on the way. Anyway, 
we  stayed there. Everybody was looking at me . 
Ah, you ran away from camp. In my neighborhood 
there was a sergeant. How to...now they call 
them...a police sergeant, yes, in charge of 
this neighborhood, district. The policeman, he knew 
everybody of course, and he wanted to catch me . 
That was his ambition. As soon as I heard he 
would arrive on duty, I'd run away. And of cour
se not long afterwards he caught me . It was 
already almost the end of '43. France were 
already broken in two, broken, and about two 
days...he said I'll let you about two days free and 
in two days you come  ba ck with me . If you run 
away I'll catch you. What did I do? My companion 
and I talked about it, and we said let's go 
back from where we left. He said, well, if we'
ll go, we'll just die there. Wh at are we going to do 
there. We 'll die. So we left for the ____. There we
 went into a restaurant again. We  played a little 
bit more. Meanwhile, this was the end. My father-i
n-law went to Bucharest. He was serving in 
the army, and he came...he had gone in Iasi
. He found both sisters. One wa s some how ill...no 
no...not in Iasi. She had gone to a camp I  

think, but he couldn't bring them back. He couldn't 
get them out because the girls' last name was 
the mother's  maiden name, but the children did not 
carry the same  last name , so he couldn't take 
them out. He was told to go back to Buchares
t and to bring the papers. And you bring me  the 
papers, I'll free your daughters.  
 

Q: These two sisters were 
your wife and her sister? 
 

A: No. So your sister...yes, yes, yes. 

 

Q: Tell me  again so I understand...your father-i
n-law was serving in the Roma nian ar my... 
 

A: He was to bring the two daught
ers, my wife and my sister-in-
law. He went in that place 
there. Yes. He went there all arme d. He took them
 some  food. He took them some  cl othes, spare 
clothes, but he couldn't bring them out because he
 didn't have the same last name. He left them 
there. Even if he had  brought only one daught
er...the older one...she would have survived 
because she was ill. Then he went to Bucharest to
 get the papers done. He went to mi nistries, to 
the army regime nt, trying to do the forms, but he got ill. 

 

Q: Who got ill? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
12 
 
A: In the meanwhile my wife's sister became really ill. When the father went  back the 
second time ...I heard all of this...I wasn't  th
ere any longer...anyway I was no longer with them. 
When the father went back for the second time 
to pick them up, the sister was almost on her 
death bed. She had clothing now. He wanted to 
take the two daughters back. The older daughter 
couldn't resist any more. She took him back to the barn where she was living, left her there, and 

continued the way back with my
 wife and my little sist er .  
 

Q: So let's go back to the ____... 

 

A: In _____ I played in a restaurant, so in th
e meanwhile I had heard that my wife was home 
but she will tell you how they came back also 
because they didn't have any papers. They ran 
away too. Meanwhile I sent a letter to Iasi. 
When the letter arrived 
there, probably some body 
read it and went to the police and 
said so and so didn't run away back to where he had to but he is 
in ____, and one evening as I was playing in a re
staurant, three policemen
 or maybe two...it was 
ma ybe about eight, eight thirty in the evening...c
ame all arme d with the guns in their hands and 
told me  to lay down my violin, du
ring the program, while I was play
ing, and to stay still, not to 
put my hands in the pockets, t
o...and he was ready to handcuff 
me  and my  companion. You can 
imagine that having been there for a while, some
 people knew me  in the restaurant. The patrons 
knew me  and they thought that ma ybe I was a 
thief, so I told the policema n why do you not 
handcuff me . I'm an honest ma n. If you want to 
arrest me , arrest me , but without handcuffing 

me . I can declare in front of you th
at if I'm going to try to escape  or do anything against the law, 
you can shoot me . They agreed. They took me  to
 the police headquarters. They locked me  up, 
me  and my companion. Some body from Iasi had been 
sent there to arrest 
me , these people from 
the police in Iasi had sent to arrest me for havi
ng run away from Transnistria. It was already the 
end of '43. I arrived at the polic
e station. I stayed there. My mo
ther-in-law hired a lawyer. They 
said he's  not a thief. He never stole anythi
ng. He didn't do anything. ____
__ in a police. See if 
he's not guilty, why detain him just because he's
 a gypsy, because he's a little dark. Is that why 
you keep him?  He didn't do anything. Maybe it
's good for the country or what?  Why are you 
taking him t o his death?  So 
ma ny young people died in vain 
without doing anything wrong. So 
then probably the others were comi ng from the 
east, so they let me go. I came home but I was 
still not very much in peace because I was afraid
 anytime I'd say anythi ng to anyone, they would 
again have me  arrested by the police, because th
ey said I wa s not Roma nian. My place was in 

jail. '44 arrived. In 1944, the same ...I was playing in
 restaurants and that's  how I ma de a living. In 
March again I was arrested. No...they took me  as 
kind of a mi litary servic
e. They took all the 
young people in Iasi and around Iasi and they ma rche
d us again. Again I left
 my wife and again 
they took me  and we went some whe r e in Moldavia
. Meanwhile the people in Iasi wa s evacuated. 
My wife, my mother-in-law left
, so I heard from wherever I was that my wife was in ______ 

where all the Moldavians had been evacuated, th
e refugees. So I stayed in this pre-military 
service and then I left for ____ to find my wife. 
We were sent in _______ in this sma ll town. We  
were told to stay there. I c
ould find some  work. I no longer play
ed because there was no place to 
play, but this was not a camp...no, 
no. It was...I was like a pre-military service. I st ayed there 

until Ma y 20th as a refugee in ____ then I left 
in the military service 
as a soldier. Nobody...I 
didn't have to account to anyone as such, so I went
 to this other village where I was taken into 

the military service May 20th, 1944, from ____ a nd in 1947 on January 1st, I became free. 

 

Q: I want to ask you some t hing. So you said '47? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
13 
 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: I understood that your father
-in-law, the father of your wi
fe, went to Transnistria and 
brought back your wife and your sister. What ha
ppened to your sister, 
your little sister? 
 

A: She returned very ill. She...w
e didn't have any mo ney to take her to a doctor, to see what's 
wrong with her. She probably had an infection. She had diarrhea, probably.  

dysentery, and she passed away. 

 

Q: When did she die? 

 

A: She died a few months later, after she returned. 

 

Q: How old wa s she? 

 

A: Six. She resisted after so ma ny peopl e 
whom I saw die, people who were younger, 
older...this little six year ol
d girl still resisted until sh
e got home , and then she died. 
 

Q: Mr. Moise, we are comi ng then to the end 
of the interview. Te ll me  what happened to you 
after the war, after you came  back fr om the military service? 

 

A: It was very, very hard, afte
r the war, after what I had suffe
red from '42 to '47. There was 
only hell, torture. For five years I only spent my 
time on the run or in camps. In '44 I went to the 
front as a military service. I came back in '47. There was hunger. 

 
Q: So you fought on the front. Wh
ere?  In Hungary, Czechoslovakia? 
 

A: No. I didn't get to Czechoslovakia, but I f
ought until the liberation of Transylvania. I was 
in ______, at the Danube. There I wa
s till March of '45, and when I came  back from t he front, 
there was a disaster at home
. Hunge r. You could barely recognize anyone in my neighborhood. 
Everybody was changed, was different. Even the gr
ass was no longer there because people even 
ate grass out of hunger. It was like 
kind of a feed that we'd give to the pigs. It's like a plant, 
grass...that's what people would 
eat. We would boil them. We woul
d boil even like some  kind of 
poison ivy and people used to get 
sick. We 'd ma ke some  kind of pi
es from the grain after it had 
gone through the press for oil. That's  what people 
would eat. So that's how we carried on in this 
hunger. Meanwhile we had children, two children w
ho died. My mother-in-law tells me ...I just 
reme mbered that...this wa s in 1947...I returned 
home in the meanwhile 
on the leave during the 
military service, but this was '47, I think Februa
ry. My mother-in- law and 
my father-in-law tell 
me  we are dying here. Le t's go back to where we
 had...in ____ where we lived as refugees. There 
we worked. All the Moldavians used to go in 
these areas and they'd bring wheat. They would 
bring cornmeal, whatever they could find. They 
would sell some thing and they would bring back 
this food, so my in-laws said let's go there. We  can
 work there. At least we'll get away from this. 
My father-in-law had a little home. He sold it fo
r some cornmeal and for 
some money, for tickets 

on the train. We boarded the train and we return
ed to _____. There's a train station, a ____ from 
____ to here. We  arrived there and we lodged at 
a gypsy musi cian. He was very happy. He gave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
14 
 
us this little home  and we would work. My mo
ther-in-law, my father-in-law, I worked. The 
children got ill and died, two children. I dug the...
with my own hands their hole and buried them. 
They were ma ybe two, three  year
s old. I buried them with my ow
n hands. And we stayed there 
till June until the harvest came out. 
We ca me  back and I started  again playing here and there. In 
Iasi they had founded this orches
tra, a voluntary kind of music. I 
went there. I was happy. I got 
some  bread. I got some  pants. I did rehearsals. We  had performa nces in different companies, 
factories, ______, ______, meeting fact
ories, ____ which was up on the 
hill. It was a factory that 
ma de all kinds of ropes. We would play in 
hospitals and I did this till 1950. In 1950, the 

philharmoni c orchestra Moldova (ph) hired me  as
 an employee and we toured the country with 
that. They gave us costumes so we had a re
gular salary, and I stayed there from 1950 till 1970. I 
played in the philharmo nic too. In 1970 we were ove
r thirty, thirty-five of 
us with a vocalist and 
all so we were taken over by the trade union. The tr
ade unions took over a lo
t of these orchestras 
which were playing with the 
philharmonics, so from the th
irty-six, they choose twelve 
instrume ntal players, two vocalists and one conducto
r, so fifteen altogether and we formed like a 
band and I worked there ti
ll l983 when I retired. 
 

Q: Mr. Moise, would you like to add anythi
ng?  Do you have anything else to say in 
conclusion about your experience during the war, 
or do you think that you've said it all and can 
stop. 

 

A: Whatever you want. Shall I te
ll you...what else 
shall I tell you. 
 

Q: Is there anything...a detail that you may ha
ve mi ssed or forgotten, some thing that you 
believe is important? If not, 
we can just stop right here. 
 

A: Mr. Radu, I'm a little troubled and I don't re
me mber. If you let me  think a little bit... 
 

Q: So we can stop right here. Thank you so much. 

 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

Q: I would like to ask you to describe me very
 briefly, how was your life and of your fa mily 
with your parents, the life of the gypsy community 
before the war?  Just to
 make it a little bit 
more clear, how was your life?
  
 
 

A: My father was...played the guitar. We we
re ma ny children, but ma ny children died, one 
after another. And my mother 
was a housewife. She took care of 
the children. My father could 
ma ke a living if he played. If he 
played at night, the next day we
 could eat. If he didn't have an 
income  one evening, the next day we didn't have
 any money, so because of this, maybe I could 
have also go to school, learn more. I could have
 also learned maybe to be a better musician, 
ma ybe some thing special. Maybe I could have le
arned more scores. I don't want to say, but I 
think if I played from 1950 till '83 with the 
philharmonic and I had to pass so ma ny exa ms, I 
obviously the talent I must have had, but I didn't 
have opportunities. I tried to learn how to play 

some thing, how to sing, so I could ma ke a living, 
not for myself but for my fa mily, so I could 
help my dad because he was ill. I told you he died
 when he was 41 years old, when he was just in 
the best years of his life. My mother was 42 when she died. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0164  
15 
 
 
Q: How ma ny brothers 
and sisters were you? 
 

A: Mr. Radu, I think we were ma ny, ma ny. Seve
n...eight, but many died one after another. 
My mother was always crying beca
use she lost  her children, and 
finally it was just me  and  
another one left, and a step-brother because my mother remarried. 

 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

Q: The scene that I reme mb er the mostly to my days, the most awful thing was the 

separation from my sister, from
 my wife. When you leavelike
 that and you know some body's  
following your steps, they are l
ooking at you leaving and you thi
nk that you ma y never see them 
again in your life. That's the most awful scene I reme mber.  

 

Q: I want to ask you some t hing else. You said
 that when you descri
bed the moment when 
you left you violin in a restaura
nt, as you departed, your violin 
was so extraordinary. Why was 
your violin so special, so extraordinary? 

 

A: There are violins who may not be anyt
hing special, but the wood was very good, the 
sound was very good, not just a Stratovarious (p
h) or a _____ are so good, 
violins that everybody 
knows, but there are other violins which unfortuna
tely were being built, 
I me an unfortunately I 
shouldn't say that but they were built from a wo
od which was almost similar to the wood of the 
fa mous violins. It's  the wood, and the artisan that 
makes the m that makes a 
violin special. So this 
violin that I had and there are so ma ny vio
lins which are good without
 being a grand name . 
Anyway the violin was so good...what ma kes a violin
 good also is the age. The older a violin is, 
and the more dry the wood gets, the sound, the vibr
ation, the resona
nce is better, so this was a 
special violin. Yes, I can sa
y it's best but it was a good one. 
 

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 

 

Q: I'd like to go back a little
 bit to the moment for the firs
t time in Transnistria you got off 
the train, and I'd like you to describe to us th
e ma rch, the two ma rches that you had because you 
ma rched twice, right?  So I'd like to ask you to 
start from wher e to where you ma rched, how long 
was the trip, and to describe to us 
what went through your

A: We arrived in the morning, before dawn 
yet when the cars opened up and we looked at 
the fields. 

 

Q: This was when? 

 

A: 1942. Yes, yes. In September. At the end of September, because we spent two weeks on 

the train. We arrived only at the 
end of Septembe r. From the 14th of September to the end, we 
were closed in these cars. Not in Odessa.

A: Yes, yes, yes. When we got off the freight 
cars, we   arrived in a train station. We  could 
see in front of us other gypsies. Maybe they 
had arrived the day before or more. They were 
sleeping there. We  thought that ma ybe there were some  people...we didn't know if they were 
alive. There were so ma ny of us piled on each ot
he r. This was in a train station in ____. We  got 
off the train too. The others who were there alre
ady were woken up. They left us there a little 
longer. I reme mber that one of us didn't have time
 to get all his luggage from the cart because the 
train started already. We  got off 
fast and they got up the other 
ones who had probably arrived the 
day before us. They formed a column and we started ma rching on foot, so we walked from the 

morning...I don't re me mber the exact time but I can'
t...we ma rched all day, all night as I told you 
till about two or three in the 
morning, so whoever could walk, 
walked. Those who were like old, 
it was sheer tortur e for them to walk. They had to
 be carried on the back and they were dragging 
the young people not to leave them 
behind, or see if they were left  behind. Anyway, it was 
torture and we walked like this, so I told you ti
ll about two thirty...I can
't  reme mber the exact 
time but about two thirty. They allowe d us to 
rest after we ma rched 
the whole day and we 
ma rched all day, evening and night
, till three in the morning the 
day before, so with very few 
stops. They let  us rest  along si
de the road till the morning. In 
the morning again we started and 
we arrived again in the after
noon at this farm, Petrosky, and 
during another ma rch right...yes 
when we returned from _____. 

 

Q: Towhere? 

 

A: Back to ____. This was even worse, this ma rch. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

A: Because it was longer. You can imagine that we came  back fr om the ____ to this _____ 
and from _____ we left towards _____, so an additiona l road that we had to walk. Wh at is now 
we started from ____ so we star
ted from further away. So this was a longer route. ___________. 

 

Q: How was it now, the second time? 

 

A: It was more difficult. First time we were 
stronger. We  were comi
ng from home. Now we 
were weaker, all of us. You had no food. Th
ere was no food left. You know, everybody didn't 
know what was happening. Nobody came and nobody came to ask us do you have food, do you 

want to work. I'll take you to work, or I'
ll give you some thing, some  wood work, some 
food...nothing. Only this two hundred grams of flour
. That's  how we lived. This oats kind of 
flour...two hundred grams and that included eventhe grains, and you couldn't do anything but the 

grain of a porridge from it. We  were thin people, 
so we had three cans of this, so that's  how we 
had survived all this time. And that is why bei
ng a longer road and we we
re sick and we were 
hungry. We  were weak. Of course, it was difficu
lt. Many people just were left behind. You 
already were used to these things though. You 
didn't even notice when people were left behind. 
You knew that your turn is comi ng too, and you knew your turn is comi ng...how should I 

say...you didn't  even feel pity anymore. People 
knew that tomorrow is my turn, so you didn't 
even look back to see if anybody was dropping 
behind or you would never wonder what would 
this person, how he would ma nage left behi
nd. And the soul was destroyed, it was ravaged. 
Nobody talked to us anymore. Nobody asked us a
nything anymore. What's with you? What did

you eat?  Wh y were you brought here?  Let me  __
____ while you are here?  But just because you 
are a gypsy, to be tortured like th
at. With the torture, hunger, col
d, mi sery...for what?  For me  to 
know that I suffer for some thing, if I did some
thing I'd understand, but I didn't do anything. Why 
should I be tortured for that, and what a tortur
e, because pr obably I know...they don't know that I 
didn't...I wasn't  put in jail. I thi
nk in jail was better. At least the 
jail would have a roof over their 
head. Here, nothing. Through rain, through the sn
owstorm, wi nd, rats...like rats you had to go 
into holes to take cover. You t
hought why?  Why?  Why  should I  have to hide in a hole when I 
didn't do anything. I can work. I like to work. I'm 
good here for doing other things in life, not to 

hide in holes under ground. And still nobody as
ked me , nobody asked me  why are you are. Why 
are you...how did you live before?  Only when they 
hired me  at the philharmonic when  you have 
to give some  kind of an interview or fill up so
me forms, and I had to write that I had been 
deported, the same  thing in the second orches
tra. I had written down that I deported. Nobody 
asked me  why, how were you, how did you ma na
ge. All my neighborhood had been deported. 
People talked about it. People in 
the city talk about it. They knew, but nobody asked me . So what 
if my neighbors...everybody knew that I had been
 deported, but the people who counted didn't 
ask me  why I had been deported. Luckily I f
ound this conductor, Mr. ____, who told me ____, 
come tomor r ow morning with some  money. Wh
y? We'll go to the National Bank and we'll 
pay...I don't know how much mone y it is, but we
'll pay for some papers, some documents, 
because the  Germans wi ll pay us repa ration.  

 

Q: Who is Mr. ____? 

 

A: My conductor, the conductor of my orchestra. 

 

Q: Had he been in Transnistria? 

 
A: Yes. And in the morning we took off fr
om rehearsal. We went to the bank, the ______ 
Bank. We  paid some  kind of a fee. With the receip
t we got together our pa
pers. They ma de a file. 
We took the file over there, but I haven't hear
d anything since. Nothi
ng. We didn't receive any 
answer. No. Just now before I came  here, I  went to...what's the name  of it...anyway I asked, 
ma m, I brought the file here, photoc
opies, everything, and she says 
well, it's fifteen, twenty years 
before. Maybe the papers are in Bucharest. Compar
e. Others told me  to go or send to Odessa the 
papers because in Odessa they ma y do the i
nvestigation. Yeah. This
 is the bureaucracy.

asked us while we were there, how long we 
were there. Nobody came to us. Nobody who I see

Nothing. We were left there 
to die. Yes. That's  all.
