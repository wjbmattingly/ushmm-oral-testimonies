 that he 
[indecipherable]
 for hours to prepare, and my
 hu Œ and my  husband was on

semicha
 to be a rabbi. Not a rabbi, a 
rav. 
A rabbi is not a 
rav. 
A 
rav
, he can manage 
a city, but not a rabbi. A rabbi doesn™t have to have 
semicha
. A rabbi, if he is 
educated and it™s going from the nation Œ th
en from-from family 
to family, he can 
take over. But a 
rav
 must be special teached in 
Talmud, very high, to became
 
semicha.
 So my father Œ my hu 
Œ my  husband™s father got
 semicha
.

 Hasharah

Hasharah

an-any kind, only to 
work . And he was starving, they 
didn™t got nothing to  eat over 
there. And so my husband was trying to make
 a little business. So 
this way they got a 
piece of bread to eat, and he was in the 
Ha sha r ah

comfortable home, too. In th

A: For the children was very 
bad. They  got a half a glass of milk, one egg a week . 
This was for the childrens. Later they took 
out Œ away the childrens from the parents, 
so I and my sister lived in a house what th
is was a old fashioned movie. So the whole 
machine with everything was on 
the roof. So I and my sist

 Rumkowski 
came out and he said we have to give the 
childrens. So, you know, not 
Œ not everybody was giving 
out the childrens, so they 
were sitting in the houses. So later the 
SS
 with the Jewish polic

out the childrens from the houses. This I wa
s hiding on a roof, so they didn™t came on 
the roof.  
Q: What did 
Rumko wski 
say to the people? 
A: I can tell you, he was not a bad man, but he got to listen to the
 SS
 because he was 
the 
alteste der Juden. 
The 
SS 
gots with him t-t-to deal, wh
at to do, what di Œ so he 
had to listen to them, if not, 
they would kill him. So he ca
me out, he said we have to 
give over the childrens.  
Q: At that point, did Œ do the Jews in th
e ghetto know where the transports were 
going? 
A: We didn™t believed, but we heard the ru
mors the childrens, they
 giving good, th-th 
Œ th-they giving to eat, and th-they Œ the ch
ildrens having foo Œ 
th-th Œ it was rumors. 
Th-The Œ the Germans da-da Œ la Œ get out th

the war God will help us, we will have the 
childrens, we will have them. But when I 
came to 
Auschwitz
, I saw none. Here
 is the end. 
Q: Let™s stay in the ghetto ju

that there were rumors that
 the children would be okay, but you didn™t give your 
child, you hid. Why did you ch oose to hide?

we were in now Œ in Œ in Œ in Œ th-they 
called the barrack, the room. So a little girl 
was laying on the floor covere

this was gray. So I walked over to her an
d I asked her, why you laying on the floor? 
So she opened that little rag. I can tell you, 
I can™t forget this, the whole skin  went 
out. She Œ it was terrib le. And the little sn
ake, the white snakes
 cur-curled around 
because she was doing after ever-everythin
g on there, and sh e was laying in this. A 
few weeks later, I saw a man coming in and st
aying, talking with 
Œ with the little girl. 
And I said to my sister, I think this is 
the man what we ta Œ stopped him the first 
time. He looked at us and I looked at him.
 I walked over, and I 
said sir, are you the

 I said thank God,

So he said, I ha Œ I have here friends what

the older sister. And I didn™t

Anna Frank

the Œ to the soldiers, 
she said sir, t ake me to t h e hosp

 that this was Mr.
 Frank
, can you explain that? 
A: Later, later. After th e war, wh
en they start to talk about
 Anna  F rank™s
 diary, with 
th Œ everything. So I said 
to myself, I think this is 
Anna Frank
, what she was on th e 
floor laying, because she was like 15 - 16 ye
ars old, and the man was the father and 
the older sister died a few days before. Later I saw him in 
Israel,
 so I recognized this 
as Mr.
 Frank.
 But I wasn™t still sure, but in

little girl was with us in the

sh e was about 15 or 16 because 
very skinny, very Œ 
so she took a piece of paper a
nd sh e maked a little bag and she 
put in black pepper and she gave the little girl
 to eat. From the beginning the little girl 
was s-st-screaming, Mama, Daddy, Daddy, 
Mama, Mama, Daddy. Later she stopped. 
She kicked her with her legs 
to the wall and she took us out
 and she left the little girl

Q: I would like to go back to
 your early years in this co untry, okay. When you came 
to the 
United States
, where did you settle? 
A: I settled in 
Scranton, Pennsylvania.
 And they put me 
in to people from 
Poland
 
because he knew I can spea
k yiddi Œ E-E-Eng
lish and they spoke with me the 
Yiddish. And I lived there, I think a year 
or two years. Was Œ was on th e third floor, 
was very hard for me to bring up my little
 boy up there. And was pitchy ceilings, I 
forgot re Œ I ju Œ to hit my
 head all the time. S o  I move
d to a regular apartment and I 
worked. I make 30 dollars. That time wa
s 75 doll Œ cents an hour. They  took out 
three dollars for Social Secu rity, so I got 27 dollars. La
ter my  husband fo und a place 
and my  husband was making 50 do
llars a week. So we start 
to sav e a dollar or two, 
so we bought a home in 
Scranton.
 Later I sold the home, I made 10,000 dollars on 
the home and I had to leave it, my  husband to 
Tucson, Arizona. 
My husband is a 
very sick man. He got asthma, emphysema 
and very serious arthritis, he couldn™t 
walk. So in 
Tucson, Arizona
 tw o months he got mu ch  better. In
 Arizona 
it was one 
place only, a sewing place, so I went there fo
r dresses. So from the 120 dollars what I 
maked in 
Scranton,
 I maked over there 60, because the Mexican, this was very Œ this 
is the border for
 Mexico
, the 
Tucson, Arizona.
 So he told me, 
I™m p aying only 40 
dollars to them, but to you I™m giving 60. I said, Mr. 
Grossman

th em to come give the 
cards to him, he is 
gonna make them out because we had to make out every day the amount what we 
maked. But anyway, I said 
I would like a raise to Mr.

maked a little bit money, but we worked 
like slaves. I was cleaning after them, and 
students, I was thinking students are th-the
 na Œ the worst tenants in the world is 
students. Cheaters and ev-everything. So 
I worked in my lit Œ my daughter was
