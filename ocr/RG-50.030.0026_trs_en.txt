Beginning Tape One 
 
Question: Wh-What is your full name? 
Answer: My Jewish full name  is Leah, Lee,
 they call me Lee. Lee Ticton Bielsky. 
Q: And whe n and where were you born? 

A: I was born in Bialystok, 
Poland, the 13 of January, 1923.  
Q: And could you tell us alittle bit about
 your childhood? 
A: I was still age a year and a half, or two, I ri
 -- really don™t reme mber that age, my parents 
lived in a little city in between Wilna on th
e Dutchna called Garadock. My father had his 
business there, and he wa s a very good situated 
ma n there, he ma de a very nice living. And we 
kids went to Hebrew school, and we had a life of
 luxury because my father wasn™t a poor ma n, 
and he tried to give his kids
, that™s all what he had wa
s me  and my brother Meyer. 
Q: What kind of work did your father do? 

A: My father had like collecting all kind of shmu
tas and transferring this 
to factories which it 
was ma de to paper. Wa s a educated ma n, good-hear
ted ma n, and a ma n that did not live for him -
- for himself. I meet people today and they are te
lling me  stories of my father that I never knew 
because I was too young to know him so well. When they were in need, when they couldn™t 

return the money, if they borrowed, or what -- 
whoever had to get ma rri
ed, or whoever was poor 
and -- and they could not afford, my father was 
always with the wide smile and a -- and a open 
hand to help the people. And a lot of people 
were supported by him, 
by -- by [indecipherable] 
helping hand. 

Q: What areas and villages did he work in?

A: He didn™t. He had big storag
e rooms where people worked for him, they used to collect the 
shmutas from all around the village
s, and once a week bring it to him. This was a Friday, when 
they were paid, and they had for Shabbas. So a whole week from Monday til Friday, those 

people were always, you know, out of
 the house from one village to the ot he r village. They used 
to -- how should I tell you -- they 
used to let my father trade things. They traded soap, they 
traded some  kitchen stuff, other stuff for the shmu
tas. The peasant needed this because he used to 
get a chit, he couldn™t afford to buy this in 
the city, and they got, 
instead, the -- the -- the 
me rchandise that was what my father used to s
upply them, that they bought
 from my father, he 
didn™t supply them. But there always were 
more on the books. Oh, oh, oh, and they paid. But 
once a week that they used to come  and he used
 to ma ke with them, you 
know, a settleme nt, how 
much you owe me , how much I owe you. And this 
was the day, Friday, when he settled with 
them always. 

Q: What was your home  life a
nd the role of your mother? 
A: We  were very, very -- that™s all what we we
re is two kids. And they
 [indecipherable] over us, 
you know, the best clothes, the best toys. My fath
er used to travel a lo
t so everything was bought 
from -- from the big cities like Wa rsaw, like ma  
-- like Bialystok, like Wilna. And all this -- the -
- all the little town used
 to come ra -- to me, because I had toys that nobody else had. But there 
was never a [indecipherable]. My mo ther always 
used to say, come, come, doesn™t matter that 
it™s her toys, it -- right now it™s yours, come  a
nd play with it. And you know, that they didn™t 
know even that here are the people in the States
, that you -- my mother us
ed to refer to them, 
come  in, you don™t have to stay be hind the window, come  in. The -- nothi ng will ha ppen to the 
doll, we won™t be ma d at you, go in and play with
 the doll. And up to date, I never knew -- I am 
not a type to -- to talk and to sh
are my experience, and to -- to sa
y who I was. Take me  what I am

now. And I -- but there are people 
that tell my friends, oh my G
od, she never told you that?  She 
never said nothing? 
Q: Then what happened as
 you got a little older? 

A: As I got older, my bigger brot
her, he was six years older, He
nry Meyer, our whole fa mily was 
in Bialystok and around Bialystok 
in the little towns. My gran
dfather, my grandmother, my 
aunts, my uncles. And he went there to high sc
hool, of course it was a He brew high school, my 
father was a Zionist. He 
liked very much Israel, and he lik
ed his kids should know a perfect 
Hebrew. So he went to -- I went to a public schoo
l, a Hebrew school, which 
my teacher is still in 
Israel now. And -- and he went, fini
shed it eight cla -- eight grades
, and he went to Bialystok. My 
parents hand him to -- to the family, to stay w
ith them. And I was still finishing up public school. 
The last year of his graduati
on from high school, I entered high 
school, to Bialystok, they send 
me . He finished and they send me . In the first 
half a year, when I came home  for Hanukkah, for 
vacation -- and I will sa y we had the first phone 
in the whole little tow
n. Had a phone in the -- 
my father™s business, and we had a phone home. 
And -- I™m sorry, the dru
ggist had a phone. And 
as I was sitting and doing my home work, I h
eard a call. I knew that
 you cannot get too ma ny 
calls there. And they said, come s -- hurry, come  
with the doctor, your mother passed -- fainted. 
And my father was playing check
ers my neighbor next door. So I 
call him. I still reme mber how 
I climbed the -- climbed the stairs. I got such 
a weakness in my -- being so young, in my knees, 
because the doctor was so me  very high steps. You 
had to climb the steps and I just couldn™t get 
on the steps. So on four I climbed the step sc
reaming, my mother -- I didn™t say my mother 
fainted, I said, ﬁMy mot her™s dying, my mothe
r™s dying.ﬂ It was too late. He came there, you 
know, it wasn™t a long distance to -- 
to drive or to walk, is -- wa
s -- it™s -- everything was very 
close. But my mother fell off the chair and that
 was it. Never saw. In fact, when we brought her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
4 
 
home, she was so warm because she was fresh 
dressed. And my mother was a very elegant 
woma n. Wi t h the lipstick on her lips
, I never -- I didn™t let her to put 
-- I -- I did not let to put her 
in the floor because I didn™t belie
ve that she is dead. And from
 there on my trouble started. My 
brother returned to finish hi
s schooling, to get his m -- his -- what do you get, diploma?  
Q: Degree. 
A: His degree, and -- and I had to remain home.
 And that summe r -- and my father, on top of 
everything got very sick. He didn™
t take any food, he was a heavy 
smoker. He was transferred to 
[indecipherable] to a place where they tried to feed him very often, and you know, things that 

had -- had a lot of calor ies like a lot of butter and ju
st to -- hi s intestines were terrible, terrible. 
He was there seven months. So, in other words, be
sides the girl that worked for us and -- for so 
ma ny years, I had no mother, I had no father. But 
my mother™s brother stayed with us to watch 
me . And he took care of so
me  of the business and then my fat her™s brother used to come  to take 
care on the business. And this 
-- there was no life already, this -- everything was, you know, 
went to pieces. And my har -- my father was ther
e seven months until he returned home. And at 
the meantime, I went already to my aunt -- aunt™s
 - -  t o  hi s si st e r , t o  my fa t h e r ™s si st e rs, t o  
Bialystok, because I entered school bo -- baca 
-- my brother finished and I entered. 
Q: So you were going to school during this time? 

A: Right, and my bro -- 

Q: And wha t  else did you do -- what
 else did you do dur
ing that time ?  
A: Nothing much, I had -- my fa mily was very 
big in Bialystok, I had a lot of young cousins. 

You know, everybody -- when you get to be already 
beaten but [indecipherable] with no mother, 
with no father, father was sick, we didn™t 
know what the -- tomorro
w will bring. Ye -- 
Q: You were how -- you we
re how old at this time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026

A: 13. 13. My mother died exact on my birth -- my 13
th
 birthday. So I stayed a whole year there 
with my aunts. I was very thin, I was sick. I couldn™t take any food, I was vomiting. My aunts 
had full hands with me . For the summerti me , my  brot
her came to take me, they
 didn™t trust me  to 
come  home  myself. So he took a sleeping trai
n, I should be -- and I vomit a lot when I was 
traveling, so he was afraid to let 
me  travel just like that. So he
 took me  in the 
sleeping train, and 
we came home . Before we had to -- we didn™t ha
ve a station. Like here, you come , you take a 
cab, you go to -- from the airport, straight. We  ha
d to travel from my to
wn. We had a man that 
used to pick us up by wagon and horse. So he wa
s waiting [indecipherable] about 30 kilome ters -

- 50 kilometers from -- from -- from my town. A
nd he used to bring us home . He knew -- he 
worked for us f -- for my father for so ma ny yea r s.
 And this was star -- we
 are supposed to meet 
the ma n to take us home , my brother said, you know
, ﬁ We™ll ma ke a stop here in --in this little 
town Moladetchna.ﬂ Said, ﬁ What for? ﬂ ﬁOh, 
I want to introduce you 
to some body.ﬂ He was 
afraid to tell me  because I woul
dn™t go home . He knew that I cannot ha ve  a su-substitute for my 
mother, he knew my attitude. So he was afraid 
that I won™t co me home for the summer. But so 
close to home, where will I go, I cannot go back 
already. So he decided th
at he™ll tell me . My 
father, returning from hi s convalescent home, wh
erever he was, at the train he me t a woma n 
from Wilna which was a divorcee with a child -- 
with a son three years older than I. And my 
father was a ga -- a very good looking ma n, very 
handsome a nd with a lot of money, s o what™s 
bad about?  She was a very smart cookie. She knew
 how to take him in, and [indecipherable] and 
-- and my brother knew about it, and to me  they di
dn™t sa y until I will meet her. Sure, in the first 
time she was very nice, tried to impress me . Bu
t I do -- didn™t stay ther
e more, I just couldn™t 
pictur e somebody taking my mo m™ s  place. And we st
ayed there a day or  two and we went home. 
And then slowly, slowly, she star t to come vis
iting and I knew that it™s so me thing more than a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
6 
 
plain visit. You know, I wasn™t really baby baby. A
nd I saw my father™s attitude, he was in ba -- 
he was in bad shape, he didn™t -- 
he wanted to do so much for hi
s kids. And in the same  token, I 
guess he fell in love. Wh ich I could swear, and an
ybody else that knew him, 
that this could never 
happen after -- because s-such a life that he 
had with my mother, you don™t see, you don™t hear. 
And that was -- and that was it. 
Then slowly, slowly, now this wa
s ™39 already, close to the 40™s, 
the Russian come  in. My father was already the -- 
they wanted him, they were watching him, he 
couldn™t do this, he couldn™t do th
is. Everything is capitalism,  ev
erything is richness, and -- and 
he -- he cannot have any [indeci
pherable]. E-Every day they found some t hing else to a -- to 
blame hi m. And he™s on -- 
Q: And you were a child, were -- were you aware of the -- 

A: Yeah, because I was -- I wasn™t really a st
upid child, I was -- I knew. And I went through 

right, a lo -- a lot, I went th
rough a lot. And my mother was a 
extremely intelligent woma n, so 
was my father. He put in too much effort in th
eir kids. I don™t know if s
hows today, but at that 
time it showed. 

Q: We re you still going to school then? 

A: Ah, sure -- no, that time it was a mi shma sh. Th
ere was no schooling, there were -- the Poland 
went out, the Russian, it didn™t come  in. There 
wa s a mi shma sh. As soon the Russian came and 
settled their governme nt, I went b
ack to school. And my father said
 he is not going to Siberia no 
ma tter what. If it won™t be today, it™s going to be
 tomorrow, but they ar
e looking after him. And 
one night he picked up hims elf and he went, he 
said, you stay home , to my stepmother and her 
son, and I™ll go. In meantime she brought already -- 
she had in Wilna a s -- two sisters and a 

mother, and she brought them in, you know, to our to
wn, to be closer to 
her. Why not s upport the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
7 
 
whole fa mily, only her?  So they got to go our lit
tle town, and they got my -- my father got for 
them an apartment, not a big and lu
xurious apartment, but manageable. 
Q: And the name  of your town? 

A: This was in Grudeck up -- but th
is wasn™t in Grudeck, I -- I mean
t to say that  this was in Lida, 
after we mo ved to Lida. And my 
father picked up himself and he went to look, if it wouldn™t be 

Lida it would be a different town. But he had a 
fe w people that he knew in Lida, so he decided 
he™ll go first there. Sure enough, he got, you know
, in good time s we would never pass that 
street. But he didn™t want to be showing, he
 didn™t want to be -- people should, you know, 
recognize him. He wanted to sit quiet, and have
 his meals and see what will -- will happen. And 
we left everything, and we moved to this town, 
to Lida with -- compar
ing our -- our conditions 
that we lived, with the help, and with the luxury a
nd with -- with the -- with 
all kind of -- of wha t  
do you call this on the floor, the rugs, the Persian 
rugs, and all that going and it™s such a me ss, 
it™s -- it was like th -- going in a 
stable. But we had no choice because
 my father wanted to hide.  
Q: How did you get from one town to the other? 

A: A wagon. Wa gon [indecipherabl
e] train, wagons. He hired some body t o transport us. 
[indecipherable] too ma ny around we need to getour private belongings, we  needed our clothes. 

We™re storing about furniture here and there, 
you know. But [i ndecipherable]
 we left everything, 
not -- and we  didn™t take nothing. Our life went 
to pieces. It was nothi
ng -- nothi ng left. But you 
know, when you are young, you don™t think, it won™t be 
today, it will be tomorrow and -- and -- 
and what™s doing about Germans?  Who was telli
ng me  again about the war. I went back to 
school. My older brother didn™t -- 
couldn™t stay home , he didn™t 
like the way my stepmother 
handled me . He didn™t like -- every day she found 
some thing that I™m not doing right. That I™m 
not -- I don™t have the right friends -- I grew up 
with these friends. I went
 to school with them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026

They -- it -- vera -- you know where you come
, you are two years old, and you grow u -- and you 
are f -- the -- 14 - 15, how can you desert them?  A
nd that™s one house next to the other, and 
that™s not that you have to ta
ke the car and drive. So when
 you look through the window you 
always saw some body walking by, passing by, knocki
ng in your door, knocking in your window. 
So she didn™t like this, she didn™t like that. 
Q: So you™re [indecipherable] 

A: And -- and I got to be a slave, you know, alre
ady, do this, do that. I ne
ver -- I never washed a 
-- a sock in my life. I didn™t know 
I was -- I was so k -- they cared a
bout so much I had to really -
- was very, very spoiled. Very spoiled. Me and 
so my brother. When I was in Bialystok, Daddy 
used to come  and open up accounts for me . Here, you should buy the fruit, here you should buy 

the chocolate, here sh -- you should buy the ice cr
eam. So what did I do?  
Yeah, sure I did. But I 
didn™t eat, I brought the whole class 
to the -- to the stores, and th
en when [indecipherable] used 
to come, take care of all that. 
Q: Then what happened when th
ings started to change in -- 
A: Then she brought the whole fa mily to Lida to
 -- my stepmother brought her mother, she still 
had a mother, and two sisters. And my father took
 for them a small apartment. I wouldn™t swear, 
I don™t know, but I think he paid the rent, too, b
ecause they were all three wome n. And what did 
they do?  They used to do some  kind of alteratio
n, o -- the two girls -- they weren™t girls, they 
were people already in the 30™s. One was younger,
 one was older, and th-they used to fix 
clothing, or sew some thing. They ma de here and 
-- here and there some thing, but not to support 
themself. And my husband, should rest in peace, got
 to know one of the -- of my stepmother™s 
sisters. I don™t know where they me nt -- wh-where they me t. I think he went to some  kind of a 
convention and she was there, t
oo, I don™t know, and they me t. My husband lived in Lida when 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
9 
 
he left Soubotnik, in my girlfri
end™s house. So when I used to come  to my girlfriend, I knew my 
husband. I knew that they have a border. 
Q: And your husband™s name ?  

A: And my husband™s name  was T
uvya Bielsky. And as soon she found out, she called my step-
aunt, that I know Tuvya, I got to be her me ssenger, bringing him notes, he used to send to me  

notes, but mostly she send me  there. Where is he, if
 I saw him, if I went to see my girlfriend, if I 
me t hi m. We used to take a big ladder to go and see,
 he was so handsome, he was so -- he was so 
good, he always t-took us to the movies, me  a
nd my girlfriend and ma ybe  we want to do 
some thing, you know, when he had the time . So in 
order to see if we could some thing get from 

him, we used to take a big ladder, climb up and see 
if he™s in the room, or 
he™s sleeping, or he™s 
eating, whatever. And that™s how I knew thenews, I could bring her the news. So -- 

Q: And then, as conditions star
ted to change, what happened? 
A: And then the conditions starte
d to change when the Germans st
arted to -- to a-approach us 
and the war started. That time -- 

Q: Wh- Whe n was that, that time ?  

A: This was on the end of f -- four -- in ™41 --
 in the end of ™40 or 
in the beginning of ™41. 
Q: Wi ntertime? 

A: Wi ntertime. 

Q: ™40 -™41. 

A: And we still lived in the same  apartment, 
and in the beginning it 
was again the Russians 
started to leave and the Ge rmans started to co
me  in, and there was no governme nt, there was no 
city, everything was burning, everythi
ng was in fire. We  had to leave for a few days the city with 

my father and stepmother and my br other to 
some, you know, village, to survive, because we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
10 
 
didn™t know how li -- badly that will 
burn, if it will reach us. Not that
 we have so much to lose 
already, but my father had his money. And -- 
and then I -- I™m tryi
ng to reme mber what 
happened. And then my husband was -- he™s still in
 Lida, he saw the whole commotion. They got 
very close, they -- both my step-aunt and him got 
so like they would live together already. So he 
took her, he took bicycles for her and for him, 
and he ran -- as soon th
ey saw that Lida is 
burning, they decided they™ll go to -- his fa
ther had a ma il [indecipherable] carriage 
[i ndecipherable] and he decided that sa -- there it 
will be the safetiest  place for him. And that™s 
how w -- what he did. Cause the first bomb that 
fell, fell wher e -- where he was the border. It 
killed my gi rlfriend and killed her father. And 
it was nothing, it was like 
wiped out. So then he 
grabbed her and he went to the village. His fath
er [i ndecipherable] where he had a mill, and ther e 
was other twe -- he™s one of 12 kids; 
10 si -- 10 brothers and two sisters. 
Q: And you went back to your house? 
A: And I went back to my house because my father was young. When my  father died, he was 
only 49 years old. So my  father had the very 
strong mi  -- he was very
 strong mi nded, and he 
didn™t want  to be exception. He said what 
will happen to everybody -- I don™t know if it was 
wise, or not wise, but he
 did not feel like to 
be exception, like he coul
d do it and nobody else can 
do it because he had a wa y of escaping. So after we
 stayed by the -- in the village, you know, we 
escaped for a few days and the ma jor burning of the 
city stopped, we returned to our house. Sure, 
people took away things, sto -- the sto -- things 
were stolen, a -- a lot of mas -- mi shmash. And 
this happened until -- yeah, I worked at the Germ
ans, and right near me where lived, very -- you 
know, I am t e lling you, in good times we wouldn™t ev
en pass the street, not only live there. But 
there was big -- a building, a empty, big building, 
and as the Germans wa lked into this -- to the 
city, they occupied it and they
 ma de like a headquarters there and they hired young girls to work 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
11 
 
for them, like to peel potatoes, 
like to clean, like to fi x their so
cks if they ar e torn, to wash 
some thing small for them. They were very nice to us. Wi  -- 
Q: What -- what did you do, specifically? 

A: I peel potatoes, that wa s my -- my job. And at
 night, we used to gath
er in a friend™s porch. 
The [indecipherable] came too, you know, they always
 say -- came, and they sang song with us, 
and they were telling us story. And never came on 
that [indecipherable] ev
en, that we are Jews, 
or they are -- they used to give us bread, some times butter, you know, it -- a payoff. They didn™t 

pay us in money, you know, like a job, but this wa
y -- but they never said, oh because you are a 
Jew, you have to work. That was it, some  there, 
they felt very close to my girlfriend, some  of 
them had the romances at that  time. But it was 
a very short while until it got to our mi nds that  
that™s not the reality. 
The [indecipherable] didn
™t come for it, they 
came to -- to -- to do 
some thing else with us. 

Q: And then when did things start to change? 
A: And then the things start to change  when -- 
they didn™t put us in a closed ghetto, but they 
assigned -- they divided the city in five boroughs
, where the Jews -- where the Jews ha -- can -- 
they st -- gave us the star already, the yellow 
star, and they assigned us to five boroughs, and 
according wa -- who -- where it lived, you belonged 
to the special borough. Let™s say if I lived 
on Zaracha, I belonged to Koshor
ova. There was all the camps, the big camps, the -- how shall I 
tell you [indecipherable]?  That™s where you stay m
il -- mi  -- the armi es is stationed, what do you 
ca -- barracks? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Tremendous military barracks -- 

Q: Bases. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
12 
 
A: -- there was the Russi -- bases. There were 
Russian, there were Polish, and now the -- the 
German took this over. And just where they tr
ansferred us wa s across the barracks -- the bases, 
the military bases.  
Q: So you had to move? 

A: Absolutely. And you know how ma ny peopl e in 
one room?  Ah three, four fa milies in one 
room. So they moved us  with a whole fa mily, but
 who -- we rented the apartment, they were 

[indecipherable] five people, six 
people. Me and my -- we were four people and my stepmother™s 
mother and sister, one, because the ot her one went
 with my husband. As of there -- my husband 
didn™t like my stepmot her™s attitude, but she wa
s a very clever woma n, my stepmot her. I give 
credit where credit is due, she was intelligen
t, and -- but by nature she was bad. You know, she 
had the terrible nature. And he c
ould not -- he suffered a lot with me  when he used to come  to 
visit us and see her attitude, it bothered him. Yo
u could see on his face that it hurts him. And 
then he used ma ybe to tell his girlfriend, and she 
used to tell her sister, and it was even worst, 
because she used to tell her, stop that, you know
, it™s -- it™s ve ry -- pe ople see, people pay 
attention to it, stop that, change a little bit your
 attitude . So she -- instead to get better, she 
always used to get worse after. 

Q: What were the living conditions like? 

A: Terrible. So ma ny people in two rooms, and 
my stepbrother was very good friends with me  
and I think this was the main reason that she was afraid maybe someday he will marry me. He 

was about to finish engineering a
nd he was hired by the Germans as --
 in the electra -- in -- in the 
field of electricity, I don™t know exactly what he did there. But in those ba se s, in military bases, 

he worked for them. And in the -- whoever work
ed for the military bases had a special shein. 
Shein is a permit that he works for the army and 
there™s a lot of thing th
ey were allowed to do, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
13 
 
like get more bread maybe, or get some other st
uff. And I was a me ssenger for the Judenrat in 
my -- in my area. 
Q: This is still 1941? 

A: Right. Until in 1942, May eight, my husband™s 
birthday, he closed up -- yeah, meantime I 
must -- I ma rked that -- not once my  husband came
, he was already there, he me t already with 

his brothers, they had already c
onversations there, in -- at fath
er™s home and there was already 
relatives from Novagudek that escaped from the 
city because of the me s s, but -- when they came 
to them -- but them -- and they had the meal a
nd they had the chickens and they had the milk, 

and they had the -- all, you know, a supply -- mostly
 supply of food. So they were more safe than 
in the city. So a lot of relatives came to visit 
them and it was impossible already to live in the 
house, too.  

Q: What kind of me ssages did you ta
ke, or who did you take them to?  
A: Let™s say -- I don™t know how to expl
ain. Judenr -- a Judenr
at was like a -- 
Q: A council. 

A: -- a council of the section where you lived. 
The Germans gave their me ssages to the juden -- 
to the ma jor Judenrat and they us
ed to divide them between the 
-- each section. In my se ction I 
was a me sse nger in Judenrat. So whatever they told
 me , go tell this one and 
this one that he is 
called to the Judenrat. There was no phones. We l l , this  one, this one, tell him that he has to be at 

this time  there and there. Tell 
the policeman has to come  and 
take him, you know?  That -- that 
was the only way that we could communicate. 

Q: And this continued until? 

A: Then in -- yeah, my husband [indecipherable] 
few times to the si -- to the -- to Lida. Already 

19
th
 of June he had the Russian passport -- passp
ort, and not passport but papers. He grew -- he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
14 
 
looked exactly like my s on looking now, with th
e big moustache. His name was Belowsky and 
he had a friend, but you know, it was very, very dangerous because he knew a lot of people 
already and he was afraid that some body will rec
ognize him. And he tried to get through to us, 
and my father™s accept to come to their village 
to enter the forest. And my father said nothing 
doing. It will be with everybody it will be  with me. 
He ma de the effort ma ybe two or three time s. 
He didn™t help him, until the re
al section came up, and it was too 
late. On the shein, on the permit 
for my stepbrother that  worked 
in the -- in the military barra
cks -- military bases, we could 
survive. In other words, the whole action was on 
our street. And they went from door to door, I™ll 
never forget, May eight, it™s unbelievable, it was 
snowing. And I went out, my father told me  to 
get dressed, but I didn™t have a chance because
 I thought ma ybe they™ll leave out our house, 
ma ybe they won™t come  in to us. You didn™
t know what™s going on, but they went house by 
house and -- and that morning my fat her got up a
nd he says, ﬁI had a dream.ﬂ Said, what kind of 
a -- he says, ﬁThis situations is no good.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁDaddy, why didn™t you go, you had a such 
[indecipherable]?ﬂ ﬁI told you, he has his family
 there too, his relativ
es from Novagudek. Who 
will sleep in your woods, who can sleep?  We ™re not
 animals.ﬂ I said what™s -- I™ll answer you 
what you answered, what will be  with everybody it will be with you. There is people too. 

Nothing to eat. Nothing doing, I™m not escaping, 
I™m not hiding my head. Fine. I was -- I was 
under his command. We  were re -- we respected our 
parents very highly. So before he -- so he 
said he had a dream that I™ll remain, but I™ll be
 leaving the town, the -- 
that I™ll -- I™ll go through 
the section with not being hurt, 
they won™t kill me . He doesn™t know what will happen to him, 
but he knows that I™ll rema in. Th
en, leave the stories already fo
r later, not for now. There™s no 
time. And s ure enough, on this w -- the Germans went
 in barefoot, in the 
snow in my nightgown 
they took me to the -- to this se
ction. And it went -- my stepmoth
er™s mother and her sister, one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
15 
 
of her sisters, Fanny, and the guy sh -- did -- th
e German was standing and 
we didn™t know left is 
to le -- to leave or right is to leave, but ri
ght by the older woman that was there, mother was 
already older. So he put his hand, you know, like cut.
 We  four went to the left, they we nt to the 
right. Later on we found out that we rema ined a
nd they went -- and they 
were killed. And this 
was pretty long, nobody knew when and what and how
. This was pretty long until they send us 
the [indecipherable] ghetto, because they took ou
t plenty of people there, and you could go -- 
they didn™t assigned you, you have to go to this house, to th
is house. What ever you grabbed, 
which house you grabbed when they brought you 
on their -- on their security, on German 
security to the ghetto, you knew already that you 
are lost, that you cannot go out from here, that 
the ghetto is already a closed one, that you have 
a curfew. And we went out to a house -- into a 
house. 
Q: What happened to your father? 

A: Father wa s with me . My father and me . My 
father di ed in the woods. He was killed in the 
woods. 
Q: So you went to the ghetto.  

A: And next day we had to go already to -- it 
was organized about the work. What shall I tell 
you, there was five, six families in that -- in a ro
om. You practically sl ept 
to -- one on top of the 
other, such a narrow -- whatever you -- it was in the house cause those 
people, they took out 
from the houses. How ma ny of them were dead, I don™t know. I know that day it was killed five 

and a half thousand people 
in that -- in that day.  
Q: What was your daily life lik
e in the -- in the ghetto? 
A: From the  morning [indecipherable] we were
 -- had to get up in the morning and some body 
was waiting outside for us in a ce
rtain -- in the beginning when Li
da was ruined and the Germans 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
16 
 
came, we were cleaning the -- the bricks, you know, 
that -- the houses that was ruined, to clean 
up the bricks and ma ke the property, clean up 
the properties. It was not easy work. Sunday 
morning the Germans we re playing 
with the -- with us a game, let 
the big dogs -- I worked just 
across the -- their -- their residence. They used 
to let the dogs down, ma ke a game  with us, and 
the dog used to tear you in pieces. And there 
were like wooden, you know, 
like trays that you put 
the bricks, and they told you not to
 [indecipherable] bricks, to slap 
-- they told you to put -- that 
you should really get a backache, or break your n
eck or break your head. So this -- two of you 
cou -- could only sneak in when they didn™t l
ook at you. That was my first job. And the worst 

thing was Sundays, when they used to eat their fa t and nice breakfast, and then go for a walk, but 

their -- their dogs ate bett
er than we ate [indecipherable] the 
whole time that they were there. 
Q: Where did you get food from?  

A: We  used -- we -- we used to go to work, you know, it™s [indecipherable] when you -- we 

knew some  -- you gave away everything from your
self, the money and everything, th -- and the 
peasants that knew you used to sneak in, that you 
bought from them all of your life, eggs, or milk 
or this or that. They used to pity you in the 
beginning and they give 
you and then they ma de 
good business too. If you had mone y they soldto you, but not always you could buy. If a 

German use d to catch you and he was in a 
bad mood, you didn™t want to. So he was a -- 
Q: But you could not get -- you could not
 get outside the [indecipherable] 
A: No, I™m t a lking about even before the ghetto got closed. 

Q: Yeah, oh. 

A: In the ghetto there was certain things that 
you could bring in, not t
oo much, and listen, Jews 
are always very smart people, th
ey always knew how to get along.  
Q: We re there ma ny young children your age there with -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
17 
 
A: Yeah, I have a lot of friend with -- we surviv
ed together, yeah, in that time a fter wa -- after 
the -- I mean, the action. Sure I lost  quite a few fr
iends, this --  this was -- 
and then in this ghetto 
my husband came one time. Said to my father, ﬁY
ou see, I told you what will happen. I warned 
you, I begged you. You didn™t have to go through that. The woods are full of trees and the trees 
are covering us. Here, no ma
tter how you walk out, they™ll se
e you.ﬂ And I was upset about it 
because the reason that I worked in ga rdens of
 one of the Polacks -- 
lot of people, you know, 
were used -- they -- they used to plant and we 
had to clean it and watch 
it and water it and there 
was big fields of -- of -- of gardens. In the 
fee -- and it was so hot in the summer, and the 
German was standing over you and you couldn™
t -- you know, you really couldn™t not work, or 
play that you are sick, or you don™t feel good. Wh
at -- what more you complain, the s -- more 
you got over your head. Some how my stepmother wa
s very good fren -- friends with the owner 

of this -- of this gardens that he was in charge
 of them. I don™t know if it was his or if he was 
only in charge with the -- th-the Germans ma de hi
m in charge of it. But he lived there, and as 
soon you know, they produced to ma ke [indeci
pherable] tomo rrow was a -- a section. To-

Tomorrow it will be some thing happen. I pass by I heard some body say tomorrow something 

will happen this guy, this guy. And that™s how in th
e ghetto st arted to where the talking and what 
to -- what we  will do, where will we hide, and 
what -- how and what. At night still were young, 
we used to -- too long we  couldn™t go, and t
oo far we couldn™t go, but next door we used to 

[indecipherable] and come  to one backyard all 
together and sing fa -- 
Hebrew songs and -- and 
tell stories and what will happen, how come  th
at we™ll have a terrib
le youth. And you know, and 
go home , next day you had to go to work. So I reme
mber one fact, that right
 after this action in 
ma  -- in May eight, and they told us that the ne
xt day we have to go to work and we should all 
get together in this and this 
point. I had a watch. I wanted to 
check the time I shouldn™t be too 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
18 
 
late because I was afraid. You had so much fear
 in yourself, you weren™t -- when he didn™t mean 
to do nothing to you but to look. Not so much I -- 
even from the Germans, like from the Polacks 
that the pol -- the police that 
helped them out. And I -- I ask some body what time  is this, and a 
Polish guy came  over to me  and he s a id the time, and I said thank you, and we went into the 
house. Didn™t take an hour, he come s in with a Ge rman. He s a ys, ﬁWhere is the girl that asked 

me what time it is?ﬂ My father 
ra -- pushed me already away out to the room, complete to 
another room where other people were. And he showed
 him, he said this one, this one. He said 
no. I want to see the girl that asked me the time
. So my father got very nervous and he started 
already, he said, ﬁKill me. What do you want to do 
to her?  Kill her?  Kill me , I™m old man.ﬂ Four 
-- he was maybe 46 years there. Kill me . Said, 
ﬁNo, I™ll tell you what, I won™t do nothing to you. 
I™ll -- I™ll murder you, but after 
you give me  your -- your dau -- what connection do you have? ﬂ  
He didn™t wa nt to tell him that I™m his daughter
. Anyway, I saw it™s -- it™s very crucial, I came 
out. I came out and he said -- ﬁI di dn™t do nothing,ﬂ
 I said, ﬁI just ask you what time because I 
wanted to be on time tomorrow morning.ﬂ It was just
 a stupid game  that he wanted to scare the 

whole house and he want to ma ke a -- a game  
of it . Turned around, took away my wat c h and 
went out. What di -- what did I do? But just
 stupid game . You know, 
anything to show the 
authorities that they -- they-they are the big sh
ots. And this wasn™t the lesson for my father 
either, because that time I started to bother 
hi m [indecipherabl e] look, we went through, we 

could have waited. Tuvya asked us
, he begged us, who else ha 
-- who else has in the whole 
ghetto such a privilege to go out of the ghetto on
e of the first ones because  people would love it, 
but they didn™t know how and what. What Daddy said, Daddy said. And afte
r the action this was 
[indecipherable] I™ll never forget. 
I came  for my girlfriend, in fact
, she was killed wi -- in the 
woods, from the white Polacks. Her sister and brother-in-law still in Israel, and the whole family 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
19 
 
was saved by my husband. And we were sitting in
 their backyard, singing, you know, songs from 
-- from -- from I don™t know, ma ybe  60 - 70 years ago 
they used to sing that in -- in the Jewish 
tradition. And I came home, and I said -- and I [i
ndecipherable] crawl to my bed. It was very 
crowded to pass b-by to find your bed, you know, 
but was cold and chilly. So I took my 
girlfriend™s jacket, I put the -- th
rew it on top of me . A blazer. Ca
me  home  and I lay down in bed, 
took off the jacket, took off my clothes, 
lay down [indecipherabl
e] ready to work. 
[indecipherable] I wasn™t working all right. 
[indecipherable] had, you know, we had -- didn™t 
have any peace in the house, she alwa ys why didn™t you do that. Why di dn™t you cook, why 
didn™t you bring, why didn™t you that?  Til one day, I™m
 going -- I™ll bad -- back to this story with 
ma -- with the jacket, because that was the ni ght 
that we left the ghetto. But what I want to tell 
you from my stepmother and I said, in the beginni
ng I didn™t want to confess to. [indecipherable] 
I will tell it. Let it be on record, let people 
know that when you are ma king a hole for some body, 
you are the first one to fall. She said
 to me -- I come to work in th
e fields and the one that I told 
you was in charge of me , says to me , ﬁToday you™ll 
work later.ﬂ I said, ﬁHow can I work later, 
how can I get to the ghetto later?  After six o™cl
ock, if I™ll be me t by -- by the Germans and by the 
police, I™ll be killed.ﬂ We have no excuse, they
 kill you on the spot. That
 was a [indecipherable] 
and now order [indecipherable]. Said, ﬁI don™t kn
ow what to tell you but I need you for work.ﬂ 
What can I do?  Helpless. My stepmother some ti
mes didn™t come home when she heard rumors 
that some thing™s going to happen the ha -- ghetto, sh
e used to hide hersel
f there on the roof. He 
used to hide her. Her and another few. Ca me  si
x o™clock he says to me , ﬁGo home .ﬂ I said, ﬁYou 
told me  to stay. I have nothing to lose already, cause after six I won™t go nowhere.ﬂ He said, ﬁGo, 

go with the group, return to the ghetto in time .ﬂ 
Passed a few weeks, and he starts telling me  a 
story, that my stepmother paid with the money 
from five ruble gold, of my father™s money to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
20 
 
keep me  later in order he shoul
d send me  home  and I should be 
killed by the Germans. So what 
for you needed the Germans that your own people 
could kill you. And I -- I ke
pt it a secret for a 
long, long time. And he said to me , ﬁYou know, 
even not being Jewish, I had no conscious, 
because you were so innocent, I couldn™t do it. 
I took the money from her, but was for money 
they were [indecipherable]. But I told her I™ll do 
some other time, not today.ﬂ And I kept it a 
secret for a long time, I didn™t tell no one. Fi
rst we ll I thought nobody will believe me . In this 
time of struggle for your life, of 
survival, you are able take my  father™s money and to kill me ?  I -
- 
Q: [indecipherable] the story 
of the blazer, your friend -- 

A: Yes. That night with -- I came  home  with 
my friend™s blazer. I don™t 
recall actual night. And I 
went to sleep, and all of a s
udden I hear some body™s touching me
. I woke up, I thought my father 
maybe he™s not feeling well. He says, ﬁNo, I™m
 fine.ﬂ I decided to leave immediately, get 
dressed. If you -- my eyes [indecipherable] Dadd
y, takes time to get ready, Daddy, let me put on 
my shoes. I don™t want to wait 
[indecipherable] can change my 
mi nd. Now, right now. And we 
were the first ones, me , my stepmot her, my ste
pbrother and my father, to crawl out fr om the 
Glost ghetto. Where the police was, where -- wher
e -- where the Germans was, were -- were 
standing and some how, on our stomachs, under th e -- what do you call this, the [indecipherable] 

this that the ghettos were assi -- 

Q: The walls? 

A: Not walls, the metal, the metal, and th -- 

Q: Barbed wire? 

A: The wiring. The electric wiring, because ev
erything was -- was with
 electricity. And we 
passed under the wiring. And th -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
21 
 
Q: Who was  leading you? 
A: Nobody, but on the other side Tuvya Bielsky was 
waiting for us. And that™s it. That™s how we 
came to [indecipherable] to the -- to the forest. Th
en he me t -- when he me t us, he brought us to 
some body t hat he knew for awhile, to rest up an
d a few hours later, these two brothers were 
waiting deeper in the woods for us, and then I ca
me , and there were 17 people of the fa mily and 
with us it wa s 21. And th
at™s how it start. 
Q: Wa s anybody else aware when you were leaving the house? 

A: No. Nobody knew. We disappeared with 
no sound, with no nothing. Was very dangerous. 
Q: What did you take with you? 

A: Absolutely nothing. Absolutely
 nothing, just to chan -- one change -- you couldn™t -- how can 
you, you have to crawl, you have to run, you have to
 walk, you have to be in -- in -- you know, 
[indecipherable] for the rain. It™s -- Europe is 
not -- Europe is not Amer
ica or Florida. You know, 
you never know, there could be below zero, ma ybe 
20 or 40 degree below zero. And that™s how I 
survived til we left
 the woods in ™44. 
Q: Ho-How did your husband know that
 you were leaving at that time? 
A: Oh, he -- he came to the ghetto just -- in the 
ghetto, in the Glost ghett
o he came one time, and 
then he send some body - -  to the same peasantwhere we stopped, you know, for a rest, when he 

was waiting for us behind the ghetto, about tw
o, three kilome ters behind the ghetto he was 
waiting for us. And he took us to 
this peasant and this peasant cam
e to my father to tell him. 
Because he used to come  very often to bring 
us some thing, you know, like a piece of bread, or 
some  milk, or some  something. Some cheese. So 
he said Tuvya was here, he asked me to go and 
to tell you again and again. So I guess my father 
had some  kind of a -- at wa -- sa -- was -- was 
talking to this ma n, but he di
dn™t tell us, us he surprised. Ma
ybe his wife knew, but us he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
22 
 
surprised. Me and my stepbrother were very much
 surprised. Later this same  night we  had to go 
out. And that™s how it started. We  -- 
Q: What -- what were you thoughts as a young --
 as a young woma n at that time , a young -- 
A: What I thought? 

Q: -- what -- as you were escaping, do reme mber feeling? 

A: I was escaping, I -- I don™t know, I had -- I had 
the picture of my old -- that whole night was 
the fi -- picture in front of me from the benc
h, from where I put on my gi rlfriend™s jacket. The 
whole young people there were sitting, and just lik
e I left everything behind me . I wa  -- I didn™t 
have a feeling of sorry, but I --
 I said to myself, why couldn™t 
I share with them and tell them? 
First of all, I didn™t know, because I di dn™t know 
until I didn™t come home. And I didn™t go into 
bed, my father came to me, because he was af
raid ma ybe next bed, ma ybe I™ll te-tell some body 
some thing. You know?  But I had a picture, oh they re
ma ined there, they™ll have to go to work 
tomorrow. They™ll have Sunday the same  show w
ith the dogs. They™ll have this, they™ll have 
that. I was too young to have specia
l feelings. But I said oh, I™ll mi ss 
that sitting in the backyard 
and not seeing my friends. I don™t know where 
I™m going, I™m going to the wolves, I™m going to 
the bears, I™m going to the -- to the woods without
 nothing. It™s very har -- it was very hard to 
turn into a animal, being a human be ing. In that 
time  we were animals, but we were -- we had 
freedom. We could move. Not in daytime, but at ni
ght time . And that™s how the leadership of my 
husband went. My husband was [indecipherable] then 
we were constantly together. He was with 
his girlfriend and I was with my fa mily, but 
this was counted as we lived in one bunker, you 
know, we made one -- one place of -- of living to
gether. And he saw that -- how much suffering 
I™m [indecipherable] how alone I am in this world. 
And he saw that my father wants to help me  
and he can, but he was -- he was 
threatened that she™ll leave him 
[indecipherable] do that. So he -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
23 
 
- and so he tried, he tried to supply me  boots, he
 tried to supply me  war m
 clothes. He tried to 
always when he went out to bring some thing more
 for me . He told me  always not to take so 
much to heart, things will 
change, everything will pass. 
Q: Where was the first pl ace that
 you stayed after you got out? 
A: The first place was very close, I don™t re
member exactly, but it was very -- it wasn™t 
organized. And that people were alr
eady -- the one, the family people 
that were there, they -- and 
the -- and the -- ther
e were family people and there were ne
ighbors next village from t hem, that 
they were relatives of m -- of my
 brother-in-law, that he got invol
ved with one of their daughters, 

so he took out the parents, and he took out the si
sters and the brothers. Alltogether with us it was 
21 people. But the other 17 people started alread
y, especially the older people. What are you 
going to do, how will you feed them, at least we 
are 17 people, here four more mouths, four 
more this. But my husba nd always find a way. He 
always said to [indecipherable] ﬁI™ll find a 
way to -- to feed them, I ™ ll find a way to suppl
y them. Don™t you worry about. It™s more Jews, 
it™s better.ﬂ And slowly, slowly 
he started with his love and he wants to save Jews from the 
ghetto. He doesn™t care how, he doesn™t care what
 people will say, he doesn
™t care if they™ll be 
satisfied with it. He mus t  save Jews fr om 
-- and he was asked the question, what would you 
rather  do? Kill 10 Germans or save one Jew? And very openly and with a lot of dignity he said, 

ﬁSave one Je w.ﬂ 

Q: We ll -- we ll I -- yeah, we™re going to have to 
change the tape on that wonderful quote. We ™re 
going to change tapes. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape One

Beginning Tape Two  
Q: All right, tell us again 
who ma de up the group, the first 
group, once you got out of the ghetto. 
A: When I came to the woods, there was no group, 
there was a fa mily, me mbers of the family, 
there was -- all related to each ot
her. And they were in -- hesi
tating if to accept new people. 
Because like I had me ntioned before, there 
was a question of supporting them, there was a 
question of feeding them, and th
is wasn™t the easy thing, because they had nothing with -- a-and 
they were empty handed. The whole luck of it was 
that they were raised -- the Bi elskys were 
raised in villages, in hills, in 
woods, wi -- and trees were their fr
iends. So they weren™t afraid to 
knock in a peasant™s window. They 
weren™t afraid if -- 
to knock in -- and they had s -- their 
stories with the peasant. For in
stance my husband -- where they -- 
wher -- f-first of all where 
they -- where they came during the day, they didn™t
 sleep the night. Or they
 slept, they didn™t -- 
they weren™ t during the da y. They couldn™t st ay b
ecause they were afraid for their own shadow, 
and we didn™t have any trust. It™s
 not [indecipherable] determines. Th
at was, at that time we were 
-- we organized, it was White Russia. So you had 
the wh -- white Polacks, the white Russian. 
Then you had the Polacks that they wa nted to be 
very friendly with the Ge rmans and they helped 
them a lot. So to give out a Jew, it was just 
a cinch. It was a -- a -- a big deal. And they were 
know in there, in their facilities 
where they lived. But they had a -- their father had the -- a mill. I 
personally did not know my in-laws. When I got 
to know them, they were
n™t alive already. Ah, 
when I could get to know them, the y weren™
t alive already. They were taken away to 
[indecipherable] ghetto and were killed. So I knew 
only the one that they were in the ghettos -- 
they -- they were in the woods 
with us, I™m sorry. And for instance, my husband had a friend -- 
fi rst of all, my husband was a military man. He was in the Polish ar my for two years and he was 

a very good soldier and he had righ
t away a [indecipherable] of certa
in things that he did better 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
25 
 
than others. He was very good in languages. Fi
rst of all, he was g -- he grew up between 
Gentiles. They had the business, they had mills. They
 had t-to -- to gr ind th-their grains, they had 
to -- to do a lot of things that 
they -- you know, there was very little
 Jewish temples, if they had 
to go to temple for a holiday, they had to walk a
bout two, three kilome ters. 
They didn™t have this 
in their village. They were the only Jewish fa mily in their village. But they had good things too 

done, and certain people that they 
want to reme mber, and th-the 
-- they pay -- they pay them a 
good price later on. Meaning what?  
Let™s say there was a neighbor, my husband™s friend that 
came to the mill for a certain thing. I don™t rememb
er what he came for but was -- I really -- I 
wasn™t born there, I don™t know the 
-- the -- all the obstacles ther
e, but that™s what I heard and 
read fa -- about my husband. So he came there, a
nd there was a he -- they were not poor people 

either, the -- the neighbors, the -- the man that
 I™m telling you the stor y about. And there was a 
mill by [indecipherable] not far from each other,and there was a big river. This guy was 12 or 13 

years old and he went to the ri
ver, he jumped, and he drowned. My husband was right near the 
river and he saw that. He jumped 
in his clothes and he saved him.
 His parents never could forget 
that. In the time of the war, wh
en he find out that he is some
where in the neighborhood, he paid 
him a visit. But he didn™t know even which 
house is his. This was so ma ny years ago. 

Accidentally he knocked in the hous
e of his parents, and he ask hi
m about Andre. And his father 
says -- he recognized him i mme diately, he sa
id, ﬁYou are -- God brought you here, you are my 
son™s savior. You saved his life. He is not living 
with me , but right here and here he is living, go 
knock in his door, he™ll be very happy to see yo
u.ﬂ And sure enough he did it, and as he knocked 
in the door, he said to him, ﬁIt™s a very 
fa miliar voice, but I don™t know the name, I don™t 
reme mber you.ﬂ He says, ﬁDon™t you reme mber
 how you drowned and I saved you? ﬂ  ﬁOh my 

God,ﬂ he said, ﬁBielsky, what are you doing
?  I thought you are long ti
me  not betweenthe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
26 
 
living.ﬂ Took him in, he stationed him, he gave 
him to eat. There was days that th-they were 
hungry. They couldn™t find the -- a house to go in or
 they couldn™t, or there was Germans, or 
there were Poles, or they -- th
e owner didn™t let them in because he was afraid for him his ho -- 
his lo -- own life. But a lot of risked their ow
n life. And he was very happy with him, and he 
said, ﬁLook, I™m ma rried, I have a family. Do me  
a favor, let me tell my wife that you are one 
from the Polacks that escaped from the army a
nd you are trying to hide, and you are not Jewish.ﬂ 
At the mo ment my husband said to him, ﬁOkay, 
t e ll her what you want.ﬂ But as the day passed 
and he rested up, and he came to his senses, he
 said, ﬁWhy should you lie 
to your wife?  Did I lie 
to my conscious by saving you?  I want to te
ll her the truth.ﬂ And sure enough, she reacted 
beautifully, according to the stor y from my hus
band. She said, ﬁI don™t care who you are, you are 
a human being, and I™ll do anything and everything.ﬂ 
But for the neighbors sh
e tried to play the 
same  ga me . And at the same  night, her sister-in-
law came to visit them, she asks them -- they 
name d hi m r i ght away a different name , my hus
band, and she said, ﬁWho is this guest in your 
house? ﬂ And she said her name  was Mary, and she 
says, ﬁMary,ﬂ to her si
ster-in-law, ﬁoh, we 
have a Polish guy that escaped from t he army a
nd he™s hiding.ﬂ ﬁOh,ﬂ she said, ﬁyou know what?  
I want them all in my house next week. I™ll ma
ke a little party and we™ll have a good time . Bring 
your guest along with you.ﬂ Course for some  r
eason, I don™t know if they knew or they didn™t 
know, but they didn™t go. Husband and wife di
dn™t go, and my  husband went to her, and he 
knocks in the door and walks in, and the table™s a
ll set, and five heavy-set Germans are sitting 
and drinking and eating. She didn™
t lose her head -- they ask ri
ght away who are you. She didn™t 
lose her head and she says to them, ﬁOh, that™s afriend. That™s my sister-in-law™s friend that he™s 

working for us, blah, blah, blah, whole story. Th
ey shook hands with him, he was shivering. He 
said that he da -- he was telling me  always th
at he does not know how the table didn™t turn over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
27 
 
from his knees shaking. And he said -- and he dra nk, and he was afra -- afraid to drink too much, 
ma ybe he™ll say some thing, you know, you are not res
ponsible for after awh
ile. So he said, ﬁYou 
know what, I cannot leave -- I have to go to my wo
rk, I have to go to my job. I cannot stay too 
long.ﬂ And they ask -- so he ask them, he wanted
 to know wha t ™s going on in the world. He said, 
ﬁ What™s our situation by the way?  How do we fi ght
? ﬂ  ﬁOh, we are so close to Moscow.ﬂ We  are 
so close to here, we are so close to there. It 
won™t take no time and we™ll be the winners of the 

world. Shook hands with them nicely, said goodnight
 and disappeared. He ran so fast -- it was a 
cold night -- he ran so fast that he thought 
in his mi nd it was a fantas
y or a thought, I don™t know 
how to describe that, that some body™s  running. He™s 
hurt, he didn™t realize that ha -- he™s hurt, 
he™s speeding so fast that he thought that 
somebody™s behind hi m running after him until he fell 
into the snow, to the deep snow. And in the deep
 snow, saw that it™s ve
ry cold, he™ll freeze to 
death, he™ll rema in here. He got up, he shlepped 
through to some  other house where they let him 
in and -- and at that time  it was empty -- still 
empty handed. But this guy, I think -- I think, I™m 
not sure, gave him the first gun, or 
the first rifle, or the si -- fi 
-- or showed him a place where he 
could get. But this was the first guy that filled 
his hands up that he shou
ld -- shouldn™t be empty 
handed.  

Q: Let™s return back to your ex -- you got in
to the woods, and how big 
was the group of people 
there? 

A: 17, with us 21. 

Q: Okay, and then what happened? 

A: And then a short while after that my husband 
is -- said to the whole 
group that not to worry, 
the wa -- like this we won™t survive, because small groups will have no chance. We  ha ve to try to 

bring people from -- from the ghetto
s. And he wrote a letter to his cousin, it was still in a -- in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
28 
 
[indecipherable] in Novagudek ghetto and he told
 him, organize as much as you can, because 
they had another pes -- farmer that spoke beautifu
l Jewish, you would never 
sa -- say that he™s a 
Gentile. And his son was in Novagudek in -- in the 
police station, a bi g -- a bigshot. But he was -
- who know -- I don™t know, or th
ey paid him or they ma de money or he was a friend. I don™t 
know how -- how to -- to calcu
late that. But he had the 
whole information from the 
[indecipherable] ghetto and he was the one to se
nd constantly with messages to the ghetto and 
get to the people and give them the letters. The fi
rst letter he sent to 
his cousin, a Bielsky, too. 
His name  was Yehuda Bielsky. And he wrote him, 
for your sake, ﬁFor my sake, for the sake for 

the Jewish nation, please organize and get out of
 the ghetto. We had -- the roots are wide, the 
forests are deep. We™ll survive, if
 not all of us, some  of us. In ghetto you have no chance.ﬂ With 
this me ssage, after awhile, came seven young boys. And one of them I want to tell you should 

have died [indecipherable] me ntioned it. And 
they sat down, seven boys and I think -- and I™m 
very sure that I don™t reme mber 
exactly if two wives came with th
em, or they came a short time 
after that . And they came to the woods. And th
en, in between them, they ma de a meet ing and 
they said, ﬁTuvya, you are the oldest from all of us,ﬂ
 -- he was at that time in the early 30™s, ﬁand 
you had military expe rience, you were in the army, you know what discipline is. We  want you to 

lead the group.ﬂ So he answered them, ﬁIf you lis
ten to me , and you™ll obey my orders, I™ll do it. 

If not, take some body else.ﬂ So in one voice, they
 all said, ﬁWe™ll agree, we™ll do whatever you 
say.ﬂ When he was in the army he had a very -- 
first of all, before the army, when he was a 
young guy yet, he was always interested in Zionism. 
He wanted very much to go to Israel and to 
work for kibbutz. But his parents -- one brother wa
s already in the States and he -- his -- the 
condition, the fa mily conditions were so poor that 
he had no conscious to leave, a -- mommy say 
-- and -- and his mother said to him, you want to 
go to Israel, fine, take yo
ur brothers and sisters 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
29 
 
and go because we won™t ma nage -- we won™t be able to ma nage. So he was, you know, there 
was all kind of parties in Europe, 
so he belonged to a party, it was a 
chalutz, he used to go out for 
-- for hard work, for building, for -- for -- for -- for other work, ha -- this was a -- he bel -- he 

belonged to a party chalutz. But when he was 
mo bilized to the Polish army, and the word Jew 
was for him on such a level, that nobody, nobody could 
ta -- take away the pride from him, being 
a Jew. So one time -- and -- and h-he -- he was 
very -- he was very good 
in the -- I™m -- I™m 
going to a very important point here 

Q: [indecipherable] experiences in
 -- but we want to get -- talk 
about what you experience with 
Tuvya, how your relationship developed with him. 

A: My relationship developed with him in -- when
 I was his me ssenger, and when he saw that I -
- I wer -- I was sitting sky high on a high chair, and 
all of a sudden I fell like to
 the -- to the earth, 
and I had nobody to care for me . And that™s when -- 
that™s what -- his heart -- he had -- he had a 
heart from God, he had a heart from goodness. He -- 
just to do your favor or to care for you, that 
was his whole life , because when he was called Jew in the army, he killed the Gentile, he killed 

it. He -- he was about to go to prison hims elf, i 
-- just because he me ntioned to him that he is a 
Jew. 

Q: We ll he had another relationship with 
another woma n, he™d been ma rried before? 
A: He had a relationshi p before the -- until the Bo
lsheviks came and the Russian people occupi ed 
White Russia. He lived 10 years in his little 
city [indecipherable]. He had a big, big business 

there, and they were very, very well off. 

Q: And then what happened to her? 

A: And then she had the -- a mother that she 
had cancer, and her mother
 wouldn™t budge, and she 

wouldn™t leave her, and she wouldn™t leave her,
 and Tuvya could not stay there because the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
30 
 
Bolsheviks would send him to Sibe
ria, and in that time it was th
e worst thing that could happen 
to somebody. 
Q: And then he had a relationshi
p with -- with your step -- 
A: With my -- 

Q: -- step-aunt. 

A: -- m- my step-aunt, right. 

Q: And wha t  happened to
 that relationship? 
A: She was killed. 

Q: She was killed. 

A: She was killed together in ™43 with her sist
er, my stepmot her -- with her -- my step-mother™s 

son -- 

Q: And how -- 

A: -- in a attack of -- of the -- of 
the -- in -- in the woods already. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bi
t about your role at a -- in the beginni
ngs of your group getting together in 
the woods, and how your relationshi
p then developed with him. 
A: My relationship that he always cared for me . 

Q: Pardon?  

A: He always cared for me . He
 cared for me , he couldn™t see,
 you know, that -- none justice was 
done to me . That he knew from where I™m comi
ng. He knew that -- how I was raised, he knew 
how my father was caring for me
. You know, when you live in a to
wn you hear stories, you her -
- you hear rumor -- rumors how you were raised
, and all of a sudden you saw that, you know, 

I™m like a slave. 

Q: What kind of duties did you have in the woods? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
31 
 
A: I had duties, I had to come  to my own hus
band and give him the reports the whole night, I 
mean eight hours -- six hours, I don™t remember  al
ready, that you had to stay on -- on parole -- 
not parole, what do you call this with your rifle 
in your hands and -- and watch the headquarters, 
or watch whoever come s on -- on the base, or whoe 
-- what -- and in the morning I used to say, 
commander allo-allow me to tell 
you and get a report to you that th
is one and this one came this 
hour at night with -- with the -- 
with food, this one went out from the base, a Russian came  into 
the base. Everything is in order, nothing spec
ial happened. Not everybody used to do that. I 
never showed my authority in the w
oods that I am a comma nder™s wife. 
Q: We re you involved in any acts of sabotage? 

A: I was with him twice, twice I was with 
him. One time he was really [indecipherable] 
Germans, but by Russian -- by Russian people, sniper went through right here, and he died with 

the scar . Right here. I was that time with him and 
this wasn™t -- this was Russian partisans, they 
did it to him. They didn™t like the 
idea of being -- getting so big 
as he got. And he was the only -- 
only person that he cared for child
ren and old people. In the Russian
 groups, if you had a wife or 
young per -- a lover or whatever, you couldn™t pick
 her, you had to go out. You ha -- they throw 
you right away out. He opened his arms  and said 
come . As -- more is better. And whoever it 
came to the woods, and other people
 started to -- to object, what 
will we do with kids, kids cry. 
We- We™ll have a -- a -- the -- i-in case the 
Germans ma ke a raid, which not once had happened 
that they had the raid, how will you save if a child w
ill cry at night, it a child this and -- that™s my 
responsibility. I™ll do. I don™
t guarantee you. That was alwa
ys his -- he was always 
[indecipherable] to ma ke  a big meeting in the 
open fields of the woods and say, it™s my 
responsibility. The only thing that I dema nd from you is to listen, and discipline. Without 

discipline we won™t be able to
 continue. And somehow they had love for him, admi ration for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
32 
 
him. And they -- if he wasn™t on the base and so
me thing happened or the Germans raid or -- or 
some  -- people were lost. 
Q: Besides being a me ssenger for him and ma
king reports, what else were you do -- 
A: I [indecipherable] the same , I had always to
 receive the Russian commands to prepare, you 
know, special food for them. We ne eded them
. We had to buy them. So when, let™s say 
some body c a me  to visit or he had a meeting for some body, t his was everything in my bunker, I 

had to receive them, I had to prepare. 

Q: At what point did you became man and wife? 

A: From the  first mi nute that my hu -- my father got
 killed, he told me  that he™ll never, never -- 

he never had mi ne -- in hi s mi nd -- he -- better  sayi ng when his wife was killed, he said, he 

couldn™t do it before, but he always was with me
, he always shared my sufferings and he™ll -- I 
should never be upset because wi -- whatever 
it will happen to him, it 
will happen to me. We™ll 
never, never separate, and he will never leave me  alone. 
Q: How did your father get killed? 
A: My father, he went -- now that my husband al
lowed him, after his wife , his second wife got 
killed from t he Germans, he wanted to be ve
ry brave and pay the Germans for it. Usually my 
husband neve r let him go because at that time  co
mparing 20 - 30, he was a old ma n in the 40™s, 
so he didn™t want him to schlep around, you 
know, for food, a nd you never know who will come  
from the back and -- and shot him, and you -- he 
liked it to -- to send the young and the brave. 

But he was very stubborn about, and he decide
d that he™s going to take, you know, revenge. 

Begged my husband not to go and he didn™t listen. 
We ll, it wouldn™t be my  father, he would take 

away the rifle and say sit on your behind, excuse 
my expression. But here he respected him too 
much, and he knew that he wasn
™t -- he was a big businessma
n. So he let him go. And I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
33 
 
sitting at the fire [indecipherable] and I said
 to him, ﬁDaddy, how can you leave me , I™m all -- 
already left all alone. You are the only one, you
 are the only soul that I possess. How can you 
leave me  and go?  The time s are so un -- unpeaceful, you know, and we never know what will 
happen. I don™t know if you -- if you go, you never knew if you come  bac k. How can you do that 

to me ? ﬂ  He listened, he picked up hims elf and 
he  left. In five, 10 mi nutes he™s comi ng back. I 
said, ﬁDaddy, you see?  You -- you weren™t impresse
d when I was talking to you, but you came  to 
your senses.ﬂ He says, ﬁNo, I went -- I neve
r go away without kissing you good-bye.ﬂ So he 
came to say good-bye [indecipherable]. 12 people was 
killed that d -- that
 night. He went for 
food, and the farmer send out his son to mou -- to 
go to the ghetto and they
 -- and they told the 
Germans that here is a group of Jewish people. He
 couldn™t go, it got too --
 too light outside. We  
just moved at night, the day was the night and 
the night was the day. We ll -- and when there was 
light outside, nobody from partis
ans moves around, only at night. 
So he send out and a whole 
group of Germans ca me , and the -- and they di
dn™t have even a chance. One guy rema ined 
because he knew the pe -- the farmer. So he 
went to a chicken coop under the [indecipherable]. 
And when everything was over and all the people 
were killed, he came out and said, ﬁYou feel 
better now?  What do you think?  Wh at did you do?  You will be paid a high price.ﬂ So his son 

came out with a sword, and -- and killed him right on the spot. 

Q: Did your partisans group keep m
oving around, or did you have -- 

A: Yes, we had to keep -- to move around, we ha
d to move our land around because ber -- if we 
had a big -- oh, what do you call it, 
the -- we had people that they 
were investigating constantly 
what™s the conditions, where are the Germans, 
how far are they from -- from us. There was 
always 10 - 12 people around, always on horses, to
 find out what™s going on. You couldn™t live 
in the woods if you wouldn™t know how far the 
Germans are with you -- fr om you. And then we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
34 
 
had a lot of problems fr om the Russian partisans. 
A lot of problems we had from them. He used a 
-- until we got the -- until we got the rifles, until we got the machines, until we got the guns. And 

then if a group used to go out, they used to 
ca -- take away -- take away everything from them, 
and that™s it. Until my husband put
 this under the [indecipherable]  

Q: Put -- put you under what? 

A: Put this on order, he went to the higher comma
nd, and t hey to -- he explained to them that we 

are all fighting for the same  reason, we are all figh
ting for existence, we all want to survive. Why 
should -- and the se -- th
e -- the aim is the same, to save -- that time was the Russian army, to 
help the Russian army. So why are they taking aw
ay because we are Jews? 
After a lot of fights, 
after a lot of struggle,they came to the senses and they we
re punished for doing such a thing. 
Q: What was your role as a woma n or the other 
-- was it different than 
a man?  Did you carry a 
gun with you? 

A: Yeah, I had a gun. I didn™t use too much, but I had. 
Q: When did you use it? 
A: I used -- I -- I didn™t use my
 gun. They -- they took very, very 
little the in 
action, the wome n, 
because they always had -- don™t forget that wehad schools on the base. We had places that were 

-- we were ma king bread and soap and salami  a
nd -- and fix all kind of [indecipherable] for us, 
and for strangers because with that we used to ba
 -- they used to exchange other things with us. 
They were from -- th-they called the -- our base, 
they called the shtetl of
 bells. It had a name , 
shtetl bells. The e -- the u -- 
the little city of bells.  
Q: And wha t  -- what were your ever
y day jobs, besides being me ssengers? 
A: You had to have -- there was -- there was hos
pitals, there was sick people, there wa s people in 
typhus. Look, in -- in my position, mostly I used
 to go is someti mes I stayed on the -- on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
35 
 
base, but if he used to go some where, not for -- 
for -- let™s say to attacks, I used always to go 
with my hus band. If it was to go and vi-visit 
some body, or he had a me eting with the high 
authority, then he -- he wasn™t the whole auth
ority, they had the headquarters from the whole 
partisans of the woods, which ther
e was a Mr. Platone, that was not 
his -- his name  -- real name , 
I think Janika was his real name . And they had 
to report to him like you have to report to your 
supervisor, like I had to report to my wherever
 I worked, my supervisor. They had to report 
everything, there wasn™t just 
you can do what you want to do. 
Q: And whe n did you travel, at night? 
A: Everything was at night, forget in -- in the 
woods about the day. We  had -- we had a -- a wait 
for 10 days from the Germans. Nobody, not from
 Russia, not from [indecipherable] survived 
fully. Our -- we were at that time , I think, cl
ose to 800 - 900 people, and not one was mi ssing. 10 
days with no food in -- in
 -- sitting in water up to your throat. 
And so the kids were carried out, 
because the management , it was [indecipherable]. 
Q: Let™s talk about how 
the -- the camps were set up. Did you sleep in tents? 
A: In tents. In tents in the summer, on the earth, 
tents in the wi nter, used to build things, in the 
beginning especially and cover th
em, you know, winter if snow and you ma ke one step, it™s very 
-- it shows. So we used to take a -- what 
do you call this?  A strainer. As you walked, you had a 
strainer and you cover it right
 away with the snow, it -- th
at your steps shouldn™t show. 
Q: And how ma ny people were in the tents? 
A: Depends. Usually, you know, friends got together, I 
want to stay with this one, I want to stay 
with this one. And there were bi
gger tents and there were smaller tent s. There were then -- in the 
winter we had under the earth. We  had to 
build, you know, under because you couldn™t -- 
couldn™t survive it™s -- the cold. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
36 
 
Q: How did you do the cooking when [indecipherable] 
A: Cookings was like this, for -- it was a genera
l. Before each husband went on a -- some  kind of 
operation, no ma tter how you watched him and how 
he was restricted, you had to bring -- you 
always brought some thing for his wife. So she us
ed to prepare herself. But there was a general 
kitchen for everybody. Special attention [indeciph
erable] all the people and the kids. We had 
rabbis, we had traditions. You could not force th
e people to do that, but 
the -- the people that  
wanted to observe, they did, they had no problem
 with it. They came to my husband, they asked 
they wanted to pray or they want to b -- to 
bake matzoh for Passover, they know the date, they 
were welcome to.  

Q: What about personal 
hygiene and sanitation? 
A: We  had a hospital. We had a -- it was a 
problem, and whe n the problem got -- when we 
started with typhus, they ma de a 
-- they build it, a special what do you call -- it was the solarium, 
that™s for sure. 
Q: A special ward, or -- a ward or a -- 
A: Right, that had always hot 
water, and at such a temperat
ure that you could hang up your 
clothes if you had some  insects or li
ce, or anything in it, it was -- it 
-- it -- it was -- i -- they got 
rid of it because the -- the temperature of the heat killed them. 

Q: Was lice a problem? 

A: Oh yeah. Sure. Not everybody. I didn™t have it
, I don™t know what it means to have it, but it 
was. Certain people had it. 

Q: How large was your camp, the largest it grew? 

A: 1250 people were left in the woods. And this is 
after we lost -- we lost 
very little people. But 
the last day of ca -- going out from t he woods -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026

Q: Is that -- part were olde
r, and what part were younger? 
A: The -- we had -- in the beginning we had a 
lot of young people, but then the Russian -- 
Q: Just a mi n -- could you -- there™s -- some thing™
s the ma tter with the tape. [inaudible] – I was 
asking you about the ma ke-up of the group, how
 ma ny were older pe
ople, how ma ny were 
children. [indecipherable] 

A: Exactly, I cannot -- there was 
-- were -- in the beginning was 
a lot of young people, and then 
he d -- he didn™t rest. The only th
ing what he wanted is to save
. And the -- he opened his hands 
for kids -- for older people and children. Some  
[indecipherable] we had -- the children were born 
in the woods. Abortions were done in the woods. We
 had a medical staff. I wouldn™t say that we 
had so -- so much of antibiotics, it was very 
hard, but certain operations
 were done. People with 
frozen feet were cured. People with typhuses 
were cured. And the food wasn™t so excellent 
excellent that, you know, you could put them so fast
 on -- on their feet. But the most privileges 
of food and milk and the 
better things had the kids and the old -- elder.  
Q: Did you yourself come  in contact with a
ny of the Russian partisan [indecipherable]. 
A: Oh yeah, sure, sure. First of all they came to 
visit us because this was a show, we had shows. 
They came to a show, like you are going to a show, like I am going to later a show. Our kids 

used to perform, we had [indecipherable]. They 
prepared it, and at nigh
t, whoever had a little 
talent , they rehearse it and they ga
ve a show, and a lot of people us
ed to come  to us cause we had 
a lot of space, we build a special place for it. 

Q: And then you had to continue m
oving, so you would just pick up -- 
A: We  had to continue moving because we didn™t
 -- we could not show always for a long time 
that we are staying in one place. This was very 
dangerous, because if so 
-- w-we found out our -- 
a -- not agents, intelligence knew that some thing that determines a [indecipherable] they heard 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
38 
 
the rumor that they know one person knows where 
we are, more or less the vicinity, we had 
already at night to pack up and move
. Leave everything behind us and move. 
Q: How long were you in the woods after [indecipherable] 
A: I was from ™42 in ju -- end of June, to ™44 July.  

Q: And let™s talk about July of
 ™44, ha -- how do you reme mb er -- 
A: That was a me ssy day, this was a very me ssy 
day because we lost nine people that day. For 
the whole time of -- besides the 
group of my father™s andthe 
other group on January fifth when 
my stepmot her got killed, there was about five 
people, I think, this was the biggest amount of 
people that to -- were killed in one day. This wa
s when the Russians st arted to come  in, and the 

Germans started to move  out. And they were wi
ld, and they still had weapon, and -- and they 
came to our woods, but we weren™t afraid of th
em because we were -- ha d already a backing 
from the Russian that we knew that the army™s
 comi ng in the back. And our people wa nted to 
take revenge. So every German that they found, they were killing him. They were revenging 
better than they did, believe me. They cut it -- pieces from them until my husband ma de a stop of 
it. He said, ﬁJust leave it, let™s leave them to the authorities, they™ll pay thei r price.ﬂ But before 

they came up to -- to our -- to our base, they me t 
with our people and they had a fight, and nine 
people killed at that time in one day. Next da
y we led to [indecipherable]. This was a tragedy 
because to live through years, and then the last 
day just before freedom, to lose people, he was 

sick over it.  

Q: And the ma  -- then you started to
 leave the woods [indecipherable] 
A: He lead them -- he lead them to Novagudek. He ma de -- he ma de -- there was, you know, 

very little people left, only the 
one that survived in the woods. 
That™s -- so what -- the people 
were left, the rest were all 
Gentiles. The one -- the war -- th
e one that lived through the war 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
39 
 
there. For Jews there were only the one that 
escaped for -- to the w
oods. And ma ybe some  of 
them were in Russia that they came  later on. So 
they organized, each one of the partisans got a -- 
a notification that he served in the partisans fr om 
this year to this year, and now they are free and 
welcome to go where and do whatever they want. And each one went out for the document -- 
there is the doc -- documents in 
Israel to -- that they have, y
ou know, they ma de photocopies of 
it, because very little ha -- 
rema ined with them. They coul
d travel to [indecipherable] 
Q: And wha t  did you do? 

A: They were -- husband didn™t stay too long in
 Novagudek, my husband decided to go to Lida 
and they give him -- he had no problem of getting wo
rk. I was a librarian at that time, I got a job. 
And he started to -- we had no electricity in Li
da during the war, and 
everything was destroyed. 
So they put him on the job to bring back the el
ectricity to the city, to Lida. And he should 
ma nage that and be in charge of it. And it 
was a big deal to build
 it, but he was very 
[indecipherable]. He knew that he wouldn™t be able
 to live in Russia, and that too ma ny people 
knew him. 

Q: We re just the two of you together? 

A: T-Two of us together, and 
his brother and his wife and a 
younger brother. But we lived -- 
everyone lived separate, so we di
dn™t live together. And he didn™t li
ke the attitude 
of the Russian 
people. He didn™t like them in the woods, and he
 didn™t like them comi ng
 out from the woods. 
And he knew that some day they™ll fi nd some  reason to -- to do some thing to him. And in not 

quite a year, I think ma ybe nine or se-seven mont hs, he decided that he 
wants to leave Lida, he 
wants out of Poland, he wants out of Russia. A
nd that -- then we escaped. We  were again the 
first ones to escape. We  left. Him, me , I was pregna
nt at that time  and we
 went through hell, we 
came to Wilna, from Wi lna -- 
but everybody knew my husba nd, so wherever he came he had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
40 
 
welcome, he  had no problems of getting nowhere
. Everything was directed. People fr -- even 
from Israel there was [indeciphe
rable] representatives sent 
from Israel, you know, for the 
survivors to th -- to direct them where to go. So we
 were direct to -- to Poland, I came to my city, 
Bialystok, I looked at the -- at the 
streets and the houses and this -- 
I didn™t want to stay one day. 
And on top of everything, my husband was reco
gnized by one of the Russian [indecipherable] 
and he said, ﬁOh, you are still alive, you are he
re? ﬂ  So next morning we were -- escaped. 
Q: Where did you go? 
A: We  went to Lublin, and in Lublin was the 
same  story, we stayed 10 days, after 10 days 
some body me t hi m aga i n. And he didn™t want to ge
t involved with them. And -- and slowly we 
went through [indecipherable] it wasn™t so easy. 
We got in touch with the Israeli representatives, 
and they ma naged us, from there we went to Cz
echoslovakia, and then we went to Hungary and 
then we stayed in Romania for a half a year. I lo
st my child there, and -- 
and then they -- we got 
officially certificates from the British governme nt to go to official [inde
cipherable], yeah, just 
because of hi m. So we legally -- legally by boat we
nt -- after a half a year
, we stayed in Romania 
a half a year in a kibbutz, and as th -- and waite
d for our certificates becau
se they promised them, 
else we won™t go any other way, you™ll go lega
lly to Israel for your [indecipherable] 
Q: And whe n did you arrive in Israel? 

A: In ™45. 

Q: And how long did you stay? 

A: I stayed there a la -- quite 
er -- probably about 11 years, he
 stayed 10 years because he got 
very sick. He  had a very bad ulcer, and in that ti
me  they didn™t operate in 
Israel yet, so he had a 
family in the States, and they forced hi m to co
me  and to operate, but he
 didn™t want to do on his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0026  
41 
 
own, so he waited I should come , and I had two sma
ll kids and I didn™t want to part with Israel 
for no mone y. I was tired of wandering. 
Q: So when did you arrive in the United States? 

A: I -- I -- with no choice, I wouldn™t leave my 
husband, in ™56, with my son, the one that you 
saw, and my  older daughter, and on
e son was born in the United States. 
Q: Is there anything you would like to add to th
is interview, we™re almos t  finished. So me  
statement? 

A: I -- I would like to say 
that thanks to him, not only I live, bu
t a lot of people, tens of thousands 
of people in Israel  and all over the world because the families got bigger and the families had 

children, the children had children,

the history.
