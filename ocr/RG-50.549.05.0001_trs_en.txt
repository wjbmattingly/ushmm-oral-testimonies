Tape 1, Side A 
 
Q: This is Arwen Donahue.  It™s January 10
th
, 1996 and I™m here with Mr. Robert Holczer in 
Paris, Kentucky and this is a United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum interview tape one, 
side A.  And Mr., Mr. Holczer, if we can just
 begin by you telling me  your
 name at birth and 
the place of birth and your date of birth. 
 

A: I, my name  is Robert Holczer.  I was born in Budapest in 1929, August 31. 

 

Q: And, will you tell me something about your moth
er and your father, their, their names and 
their family backgrounds?  
 

A: My father was, my father™s name  is Lajo
s Holczer.  He come s from a very poor working 
class family, a Jewish family that was almo
st totally assimilated into the Proletarian 
environment.  They lived on the outskirts of 
Budapest in a tenement without any water and 
electricity.  My grandmother was practically
 the sole supporter of the family until the 
children got a little bit older because my grandfather was a, what you would call a 
lumpen 
proletary
 
(ph)
 person who did not really care too much about father responsibilities.  The, so 
my father was the oldest one who made it into
 adult life, there was somebody else ahead of 
him but died of tuberculosis. 
 And he has always been a great support to his brothers and 
sisters.  He was a working ma n, he has always
 worked for other people.  Eventually, he 

became kind of a, an amateur druggist, worked for companies but he did not have a formal 

education and after the war, he joined a co-op. 
 He rose to kind of a mi d-level managerial 
position but he basically was always just a 
working ma n.  He never went beyond the second 
grade and he taught himself how 
to read and write and everything else.  He had exceptional 
qualities in math and law.  My mother
1
 come s from a small northern Hungarian town, Vacz. 
This is where the Danube turns suddenly sout
h and she come s from a mi ddle class family, 

Orthodox, very religious.  She had a brother and 
a sister, both of them who died in World 
War II.  The sister was deported, the brother died in labor camp.  Her entire family from 

Vacz were, was deported to Auschwitz and died
 there.  My mother never had to work, 
basically, my father was always ma king 
enough money and she enjoyed just being a 
housewife.  Anything else?  
 

Q: Did you say how ma ny brothers and sisters your father had?

A: My father had thirteen brothers and sisters, ye
s, and he was the oldest one to survive, to grow 
up, because his older brother died, very early. 
 So, the burden of supporting the family was 
always on him.  So he was the provider type
 and my mother had no basic responsibility. 
She was basically what you would call a  pe
tit-bourgeois lady and I always admi red my 
father™s values more than my mother™s but th
at doesn™t mean I didn™t love my mother.  My 
mother also survived the war with me. 
 

Q: How did your father and your mother meet?  

 

A: My father and mother met, so that, my fa
ther was working for a wholesale drug distribution 
firm.  By drug I, we mean a cosmetic supply fi
rm, but in Hungary they were called druggists, 
making cologne water, things like that.  It ha
d nothing to do with what we call drugs today. 
It was not a pharmaceutical company.  And my, at that time, in Hungary and in Europe, it 

was the custom of mi ddle-class families to send 
their daughters to secretarial school and then 
have them work for a few years for some  fi
rm, hoping that they™re going to catch a husband. 
And my mother caught my father there, which 
was very much to the dislike of her family 
because my father, they felt, was much below th
eir class and they made him feel that way in 
all his life.  Of course, I cannot really sa
y what would have happened after World War II 
because my mother™s entire family was wiped 
out, practically.  Only a few people who lived 

in Budapest remained.  So, but I resented th
em for a very simple reason, that they looked 
down on my father who I thought was a, was a 
very, was a ma n of integrity and, and hard-
working, a good human being. 
 

Q: Were they, how did they treat you as a child?  

 

A: I had a very strange relationship with my 
mother™s family, especially my grandparents 
because they were very religious and I was born 
irreligious and whenever I had to visit with 
them they forced me to wear a hat even in 
the mi ddle of the summer and eat a certain kind of 
very strict kosher food, go to the synagogue ever
y night and pray and, and in general, they 
considered me some kind of a, what they call in Yiddish a 
shaygets
, some body who is kind 
of just an outsider because I never really went 
along with their, with their religious rules.  I 
also resented the fact that my grandmother was 
kind of a, of a, of a very angry person.  I felt 
that, that the way she treated others and the way 
she treated my grandfather, I resented that. 

I didn™t like to go there and my mother, of cour
se, always wanted me to go and visit and I 

have, I just finally decided to take my revenge so I would not have to visit anymore.  And 

one day, this was, I must have been about elev
en or so, I went to a butcher shop, got a huge 
ham hock and got out and when the people went
 to the synagogue Friday night, I was eating 
it without a hat and pretty soon they were reporting it to her and they were comi ng and that 

was my last visit.  They immediately sent me 
back to Budapest and I never had to visit again. 
  
 

Q: Wa s your mother angry with you?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
3 
 
A: Yes.  My mother was very angry, but my fa
ther and I, we always 
had some  kind of  an 
understanding.  Even when he scolded me  for so
mething that, that had something to do with 
religion to go along with my mother, I sensed in 
his voice that it was not serious, that he just 
did it for my mother™s sake.  And I also 
found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to 
Israel, I was in Israel which we will come back
 later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, 
I realize that my father doesn™t know how to pr
ay, that he just mumbles the words.  He has 
no idea, what really, how to even pronounce them a
nd he did this all for, for the love of my, 
my, my mother and I appreciated this, that he 
put up this pretense but it was an interesting 
discovery for me, that.  So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically 
influential after the war to put down his foot a
nd say, forget about kosher anymore, let™s just 
eat what is available.  And so we did not have a kosher household anymore. 
 

Q: Now was your father™s entire family not very religious, then?  

 

A: Yes, yes, they weren™t.  They were Jews, 
they never, they never doubt their Jewishness. 
They knew they were Jews but they were s
ecular Jews, you know?   And interestingly, quite 

a few of them survived becau
se of the place where they lived.  Since they lived in a 
Proletarian tenement ofŠcity tenementŠthat 
was given to people under a certain income 
who had too ma ny children and not enough income
, there, the Communist Party, the illegal 
Communist Party had a very strong hold on this
 area and when, then, the World War II came 
and the Nuremburg laws and everything else, so
me  of these Communist leaders, Communist 
members, came and actually rescued members of th
e family.  I have an uncle in Hungary and 
he, for example, was a very good friend of a pa
st Communist prime mi nister who just died 
recently because they practically lived side 
by side.  So a great deal of the Hungarian 
leadership, Communist leadership, came from this
 tenement.  So that helped rescue them. 

The Communists were the only, the only group you c
ould really turn to, during those terrible 
years that, that would help you. 
 

Q: So, was religion ma inly only recognized in your household on holidays, or . . . 

 

A: Yes.  Yes.  My, my father always talked to me  and said go, you know, to the synagogue, 
your mother wants you to go and all this and that
, but he never really did anything to force 
me to do whatever with religion.  He just aske
d me to respect my mother™s wishes and so I 

had Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing 
that I did.  After my Bar Mitzvah I never 
probably went to synagogue again unless it was a t
ourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what 
it is, inside.  And, but I never denied my Jewi
shness so when my grandchildren especially 

ask me about religion, I say I am  a Jew but I™m 
not Jewish.  And they ask me , ﬁHow can that 
be? ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell, it™s easy.ﬂ 
 

Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith?  

 

A: No, not really.  It™s a strange thing that
 I have never been somebody who believes in the 
supreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot,
 this is going to be difficult, but because 

they say people who have faith, they die much
 easier than the ones who don™t, but I always 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
4 
 
just associated with people who practically
 felt the same way and it never caused any 
problems so far in my life, in my sixty-six 
years.  But I can™t remember when I really 
honestly believed in a supreme being.  And then
 of course, the war probably wiped out, if I 
had any doubts. 
 

Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father? 

 

A: My relationship with my father was always
 very good.  I [indecipherable], I considered him 
always my, my example, my hero, and I was 
very very upset when in 1942, he was taken 
away and sent to a labor camp in Yugoslavia.
  And when he came  back in 1945, he, of 
course, I was overwhelmed and in my memory
 too, even though I spent more time with my 
mother, a lot more than with my father because
 he was also a traveling salesman for a long 
time and I only saw him on weekends, some how my me mory is much more blurred when it 

comes to my mother than when it comes to my father.  My mother, one reason it mi ght be 

that my mother died in 1970 and my father di
ed in 1980, so he survived ten more years and 

since we lived in Europe from ™74 on, at least 
for six years I had a lot more contact with him 
than I would have if I had stayed
 in the U.S.  I always considered him an absolute statue of 
integrity and, and honesty and he was always l
ooking out for my interests and I, even though 
when I as an American, had a very nice livi
ng, I made a very nice living and I didn™t need 
any, any material, he was still saving and collecti
ng things for us in Hungary and was always 
giving us a lot of things when we went to vi
sit him and we kept telling him that he should 
spend it on himself.  He, he was just one of th
e most unselfish people I have ever met in my 
life. 
 

Q: And you felt this way from the time that you were a small child– 

 

A: Yes, always, always.  He was always that wa
y.  Just a very simple, very simple man.  Very, 
extremely intelligent, uneducated but a true hum
an being.  And with my mother, I always 
had a little bit of my doubts that she™s not as st
raightforward as my father.  And there were 
little incidents that kind of, as a child, it™s 
amazing how it gets engraved in your mi nd and 

you cannot get rid of it.  And the thing that I 
was very, very bitter about, that I could never 
forgive my mother for, was that while my father was in concentration camp in Yugoslavia, 

she took a little job and she worked for a drugstore
 in the center of Budapest.   And next to 
the drugstore was an antique store.  Mr. Klei
n was the name  of the 
ma n who owned and he 
liked my mother.  My mother was a cute 
little creature and everybody liked her and so he 

would wait for her when she closed this shop to
 escort her home because he lived the same 
way and I didn™t see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my 

mother and it™s not that I wanted to possess my
 mother, I just, I was protecting my mother 
for my father and so he put
 his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and 
laughing at how annoyed I became and this pictur
e is constantly in my mi nd.  And I could 

never forgive my mother for this, that, that sh
e did not realize how hur
t I was by playing this 
silly game .  And she was, still she was a good pe
rson, she did everything possible to give me 
a good education and, but, she had a very petit-
bourgeois thinking and another thing that 
some how stood between the two of us was piano. 
 She decided that I™m going to be a great

piano player and I decided that I have no in
terest in playing the piano and she would 
sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practic
e that she would take a rug-beater and run 
after me and try to beat me but I was much 
faster than she was so we were running around 
the table and then eventually she just broke 
down and cried that she couldn™t catch me but 
she had this obsession with, with, with piano pl
aying and so again, ever since in World War 
II, our piano was destroyed.  We gave it to 
some body for safekeeping and they claime d that 
the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad.  Sh
e wanted to buy another piano and I said no. 
When I, when we came up from the cellar after lib
eration, I said, that™s it.  I am now a man. 
I basically rescued my mother more than on
ce during World War II and I said no more piano 
and I never sat down to play the piano.  Never.  I never had the urge. 
 
Q: You talked a little bit about your relationship w
ith your mother™s family and I was interested 
in hearing your relationship with your father™s family. 
 

A: My father™s family was my favorite side of
 the family.  I had a grandmother, a typical 
Proletarian woman with thirteen children and not much of a husband.  And I remember 

going out and loving every mome nt of spending 
time with them because here I came, I was 
the, the, the second grandchild in the famil
y.  There was one older one who, unfortunately, 
during the war, was killed.  So I was kind of
 the sweetheart of everybody and they were 
pampering me and taking me to places and my
 grandmother, I remember, had a tremendous 
knowledge of how to ma ke beans in at least fi
fteen different ways.  
There were beans every 
time I went out,  they had beans, beans, but 
she was just a marvelous woman, a very warm-
hearted, a typical country woman.  She came from southern Hungary from a very small 

village and after raising thirteen children duri
ng the day, she left  them in the care of my 

father and then went from door to door selling silk
 stockings just to add a little bit to the, to 
the income.  The, my father™s brothers and sist
ers were, of course, some of them are only just 
a few years older than I am, so they were almost
 like brothers and sisters to me at that time 

and since there was no money at all in the fam
ily, they resorted to somehow, illegal things. I 
remember I loved ice skating and they said, oh no problem and they took a huge scissorŠ

pair of scissorsŠand cut a big hole and pushed 
me through the hole into the ice skating rink, 
nearby, so we always went ice skating.  A lot of
 things were solved not by very legal ways, 
but as a child, this was life to me.  There were
 a lot of children in the tenement constantly 
horsing around and nobody, nobody was constantly bothering me  and, and, and disciplining 

me  and getting ahead or going to the synagogue, 
nothing.  It was a great freedom and I just 
enjoyed it very very much. 
 

Q: Did you have a particularly close relati
onship with any of your father™s siblings?  
 

A: Any of my father™s brothers or sisters?  

 

Q :  M mm- h mm.  

 

A: Let™s see, did I?  No, I really had a ver
y, very good relationship with all of them, with 
practically all of them.  And I ca
nnot really say that one or the other, I liked one particularly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
6 
 
and interestingly, I spent the least time with him.
  He was a, just ki
nd of a very outstanding 
figure, a tall, very ma scular [sic] ma n who 
went to Czechoslovakia during the War, World 
Wa r II and some how worked for a shoe factory, 
which was a very famous shoe factory all 
over the world, Bata, got married there and came once to visit us and I  still remember his 
visit.  I was so impressed with him, with hi
s, there was just an air about this man that 

impressed me a great deal and, unfortunately, 
when there was the big uprising, there was a 
big Slovakian uprising against the Germans in 
1944, and he was an officer in the, in this 
uprising, in the Partisan Army, and they caught
 him and he was hange
d.  So, we knew this 

for sure because his wife survived the war, he
 was a Gentile and he has two children living in 
Switzerland today.  One, I™m sorry, one, the other 
one is a stepbrother.  He has one and I met 
him and so I knew the story.  But, this, this
 was the ma n who, to me , was an outstanding 
representative of my father™s side of famil
y.  But, today, there are only two me n and one 

women [sic.] left  of the thirteen.  I mean, th
ey™re in their late seventies, so, but on my 
mother™s side, no brothers, no brother, no sister
, practically.  I only have one cousin left on 

my mother™s side in Budapest today.  He™s younger than I am, so, that™s. 
 

Q: What were your, did you have particular intere
sts as a child or special things that you liked 
to do?  
 

A: I was an avid cyclist.  I loved to, I loved 
to bicycle.  I would come  home from school and 
imme diately take off and go, there was a big par
k, we lived near the, the, we lived on the 
Pest side and there was a so-called rose garden 
in the center of Pest and that™s where I met 
with my friends every afternoon.  And we were 
comparing our bicycles.  Bicycles were the 
same as cars today for us.  I mean, it was, it 
was a thing and we admi red the one who had the 

custom-made one or had just even custom-mad
e parts, and so we had big races on bicycle 

and then that was it, so I was heartbroken when in 1944, one of the first things we had to take 

in when the Germans occupied Hungary was the bi
cycle and the radio.  And I lost it.  I also 
belonged to an underground Boy Scout group, I 
was an avid underground Boy Scout.  The 
reason I say underground because we couldn™t be legal Boy Scouts.  The Boy Scout 

moveme nt, which was based on br
otherhood and equality of all, declared that Jews are not 
equal and therefore all Jewish Boy Scout organi
zations were disbanded and Jews were also 
thrown out of those Boy Scout groups that were
 not affiliated with some  Jewish school or 
something.  I belonged to the so-called Th
ree-Hundred Ten, number Three-Hundred Ten 
Jokay Mór Boy Scout group.  Jokay Mór was a famous Hungarian writer, a humanist.  He 

was not Jewish but he was a humanist.  And we
 met illegally, sometimes in the basement of 
synagogues and then we had to split up later into smaller groups and it was in, in homes, in 

one, the small groups consisted of about ten, betw
een ten and fourteen people and so we just 
rotated and did all kinds of things, besides hi
king, we were building model airplanes and did 
what, what Boy Scouts usually do, otherwise.  
I have always, always dreamt  these days, I 
had always dreamt about one day having 
a uniform.  The uniform was unbelievably 
important for me, like most kids of my age at 
that time.  And I was always dreaming about it 
and at school, I just looked at my
 classmates who were, of course, Christians and could wear 
the uniform and just, I dreamt about that one 
day, I™m going to have a uniform and the sad 
thing is that after the war, when we met for 
the first time, those who survived in our group, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
7 
 
and we went to get the uniform and we put it on and all of a sudden, to most of us, it didn™t 
mean anything anymore.  We were, it™s hard to 
say, either we were too old or too cynical by 

that time to really attach any importance to the uniform, so I never wore it again. 
 

Q: Did you attend a secular school?  

 

A: Yes, I have always attended a secular school, 
except my first fourth grades were in a, the 
Jewish orphanage ran a school, it was basically
 a secular school, but the Jewish orphanage 
was in charge in order to have enough money to 
raise the orphans.  So the orphans lived in a 
dorm while we who were comi ng from the outside, we had to pay tuition.  And it was 

nearby, I spent four years there and then, mi ddl
e school.  I went to a secular state school, 

mi ddle school because it was exactly next door 
to my house.  And then, of course, came 
the– 1944, and 1943-44, I couldn™t go to high school
.  There™s one incident in my mi ddle 
school that I felt had very, very important consequences for the rest of my life.  We were, as 

basically innocents abroad, to the point where 
I really didn™t pay much attention to being 
Jewish or not Jewish until this incident happene
d.  In fi ft h grade, it was an art class and my 
art teacher was drawing something on the blac
kboard and we had to copy it, exactly.  And 
then color it exactly.  And he 
came by and for some  reason, I used a different kind of color or 
some thing and he always walked around with 
a huge cane, which was not unusual in those 
days for teachers because teachers–

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview w
ith Mr. Robert Holczer.  And Mr. Holczer, I was 
just asking you about your education and you were
 going to tell me about an experience that 

you had that you said was very significant.  
 

A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art wa
s for the art teacher to draw on the blackboard and 
then for the rest of the class, class to copy 
it and color it.  The,  teacher came around and 
made sure that everybody™s following his instruc
tions and just to emphasize that he means 
business, he had a big cane in his hand and fo
r some reason, I mi ssed a couple of the colors 

and used something different.  He became abso
lutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started 
to beat me to the point where I began to bleed through my nose.  And I also became frantic 

seeing the blood comi ng from, from my nose and a
ll this so I ran home.  I mentioned before 
that I lived next to the school.  The other house was where we lived, apartment house.  And I 

ran up to my mother™s, into my mother™s arms and asked her to clean me up and come and 

basically what I wanted is justice, I could not
, even at the age of eleven, I couldn™t believe 
that this is going to be the way it is.  And I wanted her to come in and do something about it. 

And after she cleaned me  up 
she said, ﬁNow you must understand, a lot of things that you 
cannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for your 

behavior.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁWhat, what behavior
, what did I do, used the wrong color,ﬂ and she 
said, ﬁWell, you don™t understand just now.ﬂ  [C
locks chiming] And the reason, what I left 

out was a very important thing.  The teacher 
was yelling at me as I was running out of the 
class, ﬁI hope you go to Palestine to sell orange
s.  That™s where you belong.ﬂ  And so when I 
told my mother, this is when her reaction came.  So she came back to school with me and 

instead of demanding some kind of a remedial ac
tion for this, apologized to the teacher.  And 
I thought that was, that was a very strange th
ing.  I didn™t understand at that time.  I did 
understand it, years later, that this was the only course she could, she could take.  Obviously, 

she was afraid that maybe they will kick me 
out of school if she does some thing else.  And 
every Jewish family, of course, wanted to ha
ve their son finish mi ddle school.  And that 
incident somehow frustrated me to the point, it 
created a mental block.  I never drew or never 
painted in my life since.  I am such idiot when
 it comes to, to do anything with my hands that 
involves drawing or painting that it is pathetic
.  When we play some  game s, for example, 
with my friends, when I have to draw someth
ing, they can™t believe that, they think my 
perception is that of a mentally retarded person a
nd it is, it is just a, just a block.  However, I 

appreciate art very much.  I never fail to go and 
see an exhibit of paintings and drawings.  I 
just don™t want to do it and I cannot do it myself. 
 Now it™s possible that this can be unlocked 
in time but by that time I won™t be alive.  So, I rather just leave this. 
 

Q: Did you father care about this incident?  

 

A: No, my father was not around anymore.  He h
eard it after the war and of
 course by that time, 
I could, I understood the whole situation better. 
 

Q: Was that the fi rst instance of anti-Semitism that– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001

A: –Hit me for the fi rst time? Well, the fi rst one, I remember was when I was six and I was 
playing ma rbles with, with kids and I won.  
And one kid said, threw the ma rble down the 
gutter and said ﬁI™d rather throw it down the gu
tter than to give it to
 a Jew.ﬂ  And I went 
home and asked my mother, ﬁWhat, what does it 
mean?ﬂ So, that really was the fi rst time 
that something like this hit me.  And since I went
 to a Jewish school for the first four years, I 
was not really exposed to things like this.  
But the mi nute I switched and in fifth grade, 
everything started.  Luckily, there were some t
eachers of course, in our school who tried to 
make up for this.  And I remember a couple 
of them.  Unfortunately, they™re not alive 
anymore but they did everything possible to, to 
make our life a bit more civilized.  And one 
of them was even fired because of that.  But not everybody was like this. 
 

Q: He was fired because he was . . .  

 

A: He was very protective of, of Jewish childrenand he was also fired b
ecause we had a special 
subject called, how would I, how would I tran
slate this, Defensive Studies, which meant, 
basically, kind of a ROTC type, except it 
was sheer propaganda.  We  had to, the book 
contained sentences that were so revolting as
 far as Hungary™s neighbors were concerned. 
For example, the Romanians were described as
 monkeys on a, on a tree, their intellectual 
level and, I mean, for every nationality that su
rrounded Hungary, they had a very derogatory 
term.  And, actually, the book was preparing you th
at one day we will get even.  And what 
he was, among other things, he was teaching th
is subject, and he said, ﬁPut the book away 
and let me tell you what life is about.ﬂ  And 
it was a very, very human, humanistic lecture 
that he would give us every day.  And, afte
r the war, to our great satisfaction, but not 
surprise, he was named as the first director of
 the Hungarian Academy of Physical Sciences, 
so, he, they recognized him.  And he was then, I 
talked to him later and he was in the Illegal 
Social Democratic Party, so that also helped
 him.  But, there were teachers and I had a 
teacher, I don™t even know if he had any politic
al conviction, but he was a human being and 
he always tried to mitigate any law, anything, but, but as a child, for example, even, even in 

mi ddle school, I had to go once a week to three 
hours of, of labor, battalion practice.  This 
was one of the most humiliating experiences th
at anybody can have.  They had the scum of 
earth in charge of us, it was not teachers or
 any– we had to report either at school or 

some where on the outskirts of Budapest to 
a practice ground where these hired instructors 
that were a lot worse than any drill instructor 
I have ever seen in any movie, any American 
movie, because it™s not that, it was not just th
e physical, the physical abuse can be tolerated, 
but it is the mental abuse, but that was so, so
 bad, the way they called us everything, a Jewish 
this and a Jewish that, and these were people 
hired to do this job and besides of marching 
and, and digging and building, constantly, we we
re abused and constantly even physically 
so.  Many times they beat us and all this.  And we had to go there about three hours on a 

certain day.  The Christians then went to 
three hours of practice of what you would call 
today ROTC.  They had, they had ma rching 
drill practices and all this.  But ours was 
completely different. 
 

Q: What year did that start? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
10 
 
 
A: What year?  Well, I was in fifth grade, ri
ght, so it was about 1940 when I entered the mi ddle 
school.  It was about 1940. 
 

Q: By that time, had any of the anti-Jewish le
gislation, I know there we
re a few things that 
Hungary had adopted, was that affecting your family at all?  
 

A: Well, yes, in a sense, that some people in
 the family, such as my aunt, who was very young, 
one of my father™s sisters, and, was married also to a young, twenty-one or twenty-two year 

old man.  He was called up to go to the eastern 
front and, and he go into labor battalions, in 
™41, I™m talking about ™41 because that™s when 
Germany declared war, Germany attacked the 
Soviet Union.  Immediately, the very young, I th
ink twenty-one old Jewish me n were called 

up.  They had to go to a certain place in thei
r own clothes.  They didn™t get any uniform, 
anything, and taken to the eastern front immediat
ely for mi ne, got to, to pick up mi nes, okay?  
And ma ny of them without any previous experience and, and, and any schooling as to how 

to do it, of course, blew up.  Now, the reason I 
am mentioning this because my father™s sister 
who was very young and ma rried to a young ma n, in
terestingly, when he was taken to the 
front, for some  reason, some body ma de a mi stak
e and his unit was issued Hungarian army 
uniforms. 
 

Q: This is her husband?  

 

A: Her husband, yes, okay.  And he then went to
 the photographer for something and just had a 
picture taken, proudly posing in a Hungarian milita
ry uniform, he sent home.  By the time, 
the picture arrived at home, he was dead.  
He was blown up on a mi ne.  And this picture 
initiated a whole avalanche of events in our fa
mily because my aunt who was an extremely 
shrewd person, used this picture to start, to 
basic– declaring herself first as half-Jewish, 
which was an exceptional position then.  And as
 the Nuremburg laws were tightened more 
and more so, she took one more step and one more step and one more step in pushing this 

whole idea that she™s not really under this cat
egory of the Nuremburg laws.  And it, the 
whole thing accelerated to the point where the la
st, when the only way she could be declared 
an exceptional person, as they were called, whic
h means that you™re not considered Jewish, 
was to take my grandmother down to the police station and that was a scene I remember: her 

taking my grandmother down and my grandmothe
r had to, under oath, sign an affidavit that 
she is an, she was an illegitimate child beca
use my grandmother was cleaning house for a 
lawyer, a Christian lawyer who was dead by th
at time, a bachelor.  And she signed this 
affi davit which made her a, a Christian.  A
nd with a husband who died in military uniform, 

so he was obviously a Christian, with her mo
ther signing this affidavit that she was 
illegitimate, and the father was a Christian, she pr
actically cleared herself and then set out to 
save the rest of the family.  And, as I me n
tioned to you before, she did an excellent job up 
until 1944, October, that was the point wh
ere nobody could do anything anymore because 
hell broke loose in Hungary and the scum of 
earth, the worst elements, the so-called Arrow 
Cross Party took over and 
ruled from October 15
th
 until January 18
th
 when Pest was 
liberated.

Q: Back in the beginnings of the war, when 
there were, did your, did your family experience 
economic hardships when there were economic restrictions on Jewish . . . 
 

A: Yes.  Obviously, everybody experienced this 
because the men were away and there were 
very, very few employers who would feel obligated to compensate the family.  And so a lot 

of people were actually either starving, or the 
mother had to go and look for a job, or if the 
children were old enough, they had to go and work and do some thing.  We  were in a very 

good position, my mother and I, for a while, becau
se my father™s employer felt obligated to 
send us part of his regular monthly salary, so we did get money. 
 

Q: Let™s come  back to that and first, if you would, tell me  how your father was taken away and 
when?  
 

A: Okay, my father was taken away several 
times.  You know, Hungary was kind of a strange 
part of that Nazi area because the Hungarians,
 the Hungarian government has always been in 
the hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aris
tocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no 
taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or
 murdering Jews.  They were above this, and 
so therefore when the dictator of Hungar
y, Admi ral Horthy, had to appoint a government, 

most of the time that government would not 
eventually do everything that the Germans 
wanted them to do.  So it was almost like play
ing musical chairs, I mean, Hungary™s a very 
small country and you don™t have that many po
liticians, aristocrats to go around, but almost 
the same  faces some how appeared, 
if not as prime mi nister then maybe mi nister of interior, 
or something.  So we reall
y, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-Semitism, we had a 

great deal of persecution of Jews but we were 
not in fear of our lives. Because some how that 
was below the dignity of that class.  Not onl
y that, some of those aristocrats were very 
Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections
 with the British.  And so in between, it 
depended on which aristocrat was in charge of 
the country.  Some of them were a little bit 
more German-oriented than others.  And wh
en, and more German-oriented came into the 

picture because the Germans didn™t like the one w
ho was in office, then he ordered that so 
and so is going to go and serve in, these Jews w
ill be taken to the labor battalion.  My father 
was in the labor battalion before he was taken 
to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so 
we could visit him, we could take food for hi
m and eventually, when a new prime mi nister 
came, he declared that anybody over let™s say, fo
rty-five can go home.  So there was no fear 

of being killed just because you are, you™re 
a Jew.  Up until 1944, March, when the Germans 

ma rched into Hungary. 
 

Q: So when your father was called to be taken away . . . 

 

A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was.  I reme mb
er, he was not far from Budapest for awhile, 
for a few month, and then almost every weeke
nd we took food down, we talked to him, he 

was released, we could walk around a little bit. 
 And so it was not the same thing as taken 
away to a faraway country where we had no id
ea what would happen to him.  Now, there, 
there, then in 1942, he was taken away for, 
for good.  For some reason, and I cannot really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
12 
 
reme mber exactly what happened and why. 
 We had, probably, a more radical prime 
mi nister who yielded to the Germans and let th
is contingent of Jewish labor battalions go 
outside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia.  I remember, even then, they, they 
were told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they 

allowed them to be there I think half an hour or
 an hour where we had a visit with him so we 
could talk over a few things.  
And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years 
until he came back after the war. 
 

Q: And he, where did he go exactly?  

 

A: He went to, he was in a copper mi ne in Bor, 
B, O, R which is I think the nearest is Niı which 
is Serbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavi
a.  And he was there, he was always telling 
me about what was, what was interesting, th
e various people who guarded them.  They had 
Croats, they had German, they was all SS, Cr
oat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not 
SS, but Hungarian, and I think that they ha
d some thing, I™ve forgot what, but anyway, 

various nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians.  And he me ntioned when 

he came home, interestingly, he said, ﬁSon,ﬂ he said, ﬁwe never, we never really worried too 

much about anyone else guarding us except th
e Croatians.ﬂ  He said, ﬁWe had never seen 
such beasts as the Croatian SS was.ﬂ  They called them Ustaıas, you know.  He was there 

and I think, I, this is probably much better 
written than in my memory, I think about one 
hundred fifty thousand were in this particul
ar area where he was and what happened was 
when, when the Tito partisans were really
 pushing them back, The Germans decided to 
ma rch them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern 

Yugoslavia at that time and previously back 
before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up 
these slaughterhouses, where those who su
rvived the concentration camp ___________ were 
killed and my father was in the last six t
housand being ma rched and they were captured by 
Tito™s partisans.  And then he was given a c
hoice whether he could fight with the partisans, 
he could work for the partisans, or they would 
allow him to go into an area that was already 
liberated and live there and they would suppl
y him with enough food to survive until the war 
is over, they said.  And he was a very strong 
man and very grateful that they saved his life 

and he volunteered to work.  So he work
ed in a flour mill somewhere around and came 
home with all kinds of documents and, and little meda
ls that testified to the fact that he was a 
good worker and did his share.  And he was very proud of it, and when Stalin decided to 

eradicate any of the memories attached to T
ito, unfortunately we had to burn everything and 
we had to throw away his me dals because it wa
s very dangerous to be in the possession of 
anything that connects you to Tito.  People 
were hanged all the time without not much 
reason, let alone if they find some thing on you.  
So, he was very bitter about this, and this 
turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro-

Yugoslavian.  He would have been heartbroke
n to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he 
lived today.

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: I would like to ask, you were just describi
ng your, your father™s experience in Bor and I 
wonder if when he was taken aw
ay to Bor if that, you and your mother and your father were 
recognizing that this was going to be the bi
g one, as it were and if you can recall that 
separation and what happened. 
 

A: We ll, of course we were always afraid th
at he would not survive and we had no doubt that 
physically he could survive but we were afra
id that, that he would get killed.  But an 
interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me , 
I asked him after the war, what, why did he 
survive if so many people died?  And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, ﬁSon, 

there were two kinds of people in the concentr
ation camp.  We got a canteen of water every 
morning.  The one group drank the water immedi
ately and the second group, such as myself, 
drank half of the water during the day and we us
ed the other half to wash ourselves.ﬂ  And I 
said, ﬁHalf a canteen of water would ma ke you 
clean? ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, but I felt like a human 
being, I was still caring about myself.ﬂ  And 
he said, ﬁAnd later on I understood a lot more 
about this whole attitude that I™m not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, 

even though I am full of lice, I™m still caring about
 myself.ﬂ  So that, basically, that was the 
attitude that saved, I™m sure, that was who surviv
ed.  And of course luck, because even with 
this attitude some body could have shot you if 
they didn™t like your face or the way they 
moved.  Yes, we, my mother ma intained of cour
se like most wives that he™s going to return, 
and she was right because even though we ha
ve not heard from him for a long time, 

especially the last year when he was there, 
of course by that time, we couldn™t have heard 
from him because he was already in the liberat
ed area and we were in Hungary still, in the 
battlefi eld.  It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. And he 

came home in 1945, I remember late spring, it must
 have been April, May, probably, and he 
did not just stop by and said, ﬁHere I am.ﬂ  He was afraid that ma ybe we would faint or 

some thing like that.  He sent a friend up.  A 
ma n came up and inquired about my father and 
very slowly kind of asked, ﬁWhen did you hear
 from him? ﬂ and all this, and ﬁDo you think 
he™s alive? ﬂ and all this, and slowly he said, ﬁW
ell, I have a feeling that he is alive,ﬂ and 
slowly he led us to this. I remember him 
comi ng up on the stairs with a rucksack.  The 
rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes.  A
nd he knew that we were
 starving and so that 
was it.  Now, just to describe the situation in
 Hungary at that time and how you needed to be, 
to stay a human being, the, we did not live 
in our apartment, we were moved, because you 
could not stay in your apartment.  You had to m
ove to first, to so-called Jewish houses that 
had a big star on them and, eventually to the 
ghetto.  And because of the history of this 
house, we did not move into the ghetto but this
 house Zichy street One, was designated as a 
Jewish house first.  So, in the meantime, we 
moved out of, of our apartment in, that was 
1944, summe r when you had to leave your apartm
ent.  We , the neighbors came, some  of 
them, and said ﬁWe will keep this for you, and keep this for you,ﬂ and needless to say, that 

not one thing eventually survived again.  Or re
surfaced again.  They all, either the Russians 
took it, or the bombing or everything.  It™s a
ll disappeared, and what could you do about it?  
You said okay.  But people were in a way like 
vultures, they were just circling around and 
see, you know, what they can take.  And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
14 
 
apartments were given to bomb those peopl
e whose– Gentiles whose houses were bombed 
and they couldn™t live in anymore.  And I 
had no idea of course what happened to our 
apartment.  We lived in a st
reet called Rottenbiller Street, 66
2
, and I, my first thing, we were 
liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went
 back to see, what, what happened to our 
apartment because we left, believe it or not, a fe
w boxes of linen there, just when we left. 
We just, we couldn™t do anything with it, so.  
And when I came, when I went up there, I had 
this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I™m 
going to show these people whoever are there, 
that within two hours, I said I™m going to give 
them two hours to get out of here.  And here I 

was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fift
een really, and telling them, here was a family 
and I was telling them to get out of here.  A
nd the family consisted of a mother, father, a 
daughter and two sons.  And they were tailors
.  And the old ma n was quite old, the father, 
was telling me , he said, ﬁBut, but, where can
 we go? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁWhy did you come  
here? ﬂ   And he said, ﬁWell, we have, we ha
ve no place.  Our, our house was destroyed, and I 
mean we knew that this is, this was a Jewish apartment, but still it was between this or living 

in the street, in the cold snowy January,ﬂ 
so he said, ﬁCould, could you do some thing, could, 
could we some how come  to some  kind of an
 agreement?ﬂ And so my mother came up and 
she said, ﬁWhy can™t we just divide the pl
ace between us?ﬂ And here it was a two room 
apartment with their family, four people, fi ve
 people in their families and two, my mother 

and I, and we decided that afte
r looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was 
just something that all of a s
udden hit me.  My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we 
were going to, we™ll, we™ll make it.  And so
 we lived there under the same roof and we 
became very good friends.  And when my father came home in late spring, the new 

government, Democratic government, devised this 
plan of each block had to elect a kind of a 
small council and the head of that council was 
quite powerful in deciding if there was an 
empty apartment or, almost like a Justice of P
eace.  They had certain tasks that they can 
perform, temporarily, they were deputized.  And my father was appointed to do this because 

he was always very much respected by the pe
ople there and the fact that he was now good, 
you know, with the new regime .  And next to 
us, an apartment was full of old, old wome n 

who died one after another.  It was a, like a Sa
lvation Army place.  They, they rented it and it 
became empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over there so we 

could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and 

we, we kept this relationship for a long time a
nd I™m sorry I lost contact with them.  But 
then, we had an apartment and then we faced 
something else because then the Russians were 
comi ng around and trying to find places for their so
ldiers and so they, they got, they got two 
old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were 
quartered in, in our apartment because two 
rooms were too ma ny for three people.  So, a
nd I remember, they were very cute old men, 
we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn™t speak Russian and the only incident I 

remember is that my mother, of all these su
fferings, had one little symbol in her possession: 
a bottle of very expensive cologne water that 
she kept.  And she said, ﬁI am going to start 
using this after the war, when we are all t
ogether and we live in peace.ﬂ  And so, and she 
kept it and she had it with her a
ll the time.  And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a 
temporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it 
way back between sheets.  Now one day we

 When Robert lived there, the street number was 39.  It was later changed to 66.

came home and my mother said, ﬁThis, this
 place smells like cologne water, very good 
cologne water,ﬂ and she rushed to her cologne 
water in the armoir but these two Siberians, 
Russians were very hard pressed to get alc
ohol, anything, they would drink.  I mean, there 
were stories that I can™t believe, that they went
 to the museum and drank alcohol out of these 
scientific lab experiments andŠincluding embr
yosŠbut I never believed those stories, but 
this is true.  They drank my mother™s cologne
 water.  They were so, so hard pressed for 
alcohol.  And that was about our only experien
ce with Russians in our house.  Otherwise, 
most people lost their watches.  They were ve
ry hard pressed for watches.  It was a time 
when nobody in his right mi nd woul
d walk around in Budapest with a watch on his wrist. 
They just, they were fascinated.  They stop 
you and they took your watch.  That was their, 
their, their thing.  Well, anyway, okay, ask. 
 
Q: So the Russians had moved into your apartment then . . .  

 

A: Yeah,two. 

 

Q: During the German occupation, this was before. . .  

 

A: No, no, no.  This was during the Russian occupation. 

 

Q: Oh, after. [talkover] 

 

A: Oh yes.  I™m talking about after, this a
ll happened after.  Oh no, there were no Russians 
during the German occupation.  I wish there were.  No. 
 

Q: I wanted to go back just a little . . . 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: –bit, I had, I had wanted to ask you about
 when you were younger as a child and you were 
in school, were your friends mostly Jewish . . . 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Or did you share . . . 

 

A: Yes.  Mostly Jewish.  There were a few Ge
ntile friends who never, ever mentioned religion, 
never really made us feel inferior, just a few.
  And after the war, I 
made it clear how much I 
appreciated it.  So, I™m glad that I could do that
.  Now, I also have to
 say that not ma ny of 
my classmates survived because my Jewish classmates were in a labor battalion and they 

were working outside Budapest on the day when
 the deportations came to that village.  And 
the gendarmerie had an empty boxcart and they decided not to let them go home but deport 

them.  So very fe w Jewish classmates of mi ne
 survived.  Gentiles, again, the war, the army 
eventually, everybody who was fifteen, fourteen, fi
fteen, sixteen at the end of the war, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
16 
 
last few months, the Arrow Cross people, they fo
rced children out  into the street with a gun. 
So quite a few of them did not survive.  I r
eally had very few contact with, with, with the 
few that survived but there weren™t too ma ny. 
 
Q: And you had me ntioned that your father™s 
employer was helping you and your mother out. 
 

A: Yes. Yes.  Yes.  And my fa
ther was very grateful to him and worked for him again after the 
war. 
 

Q: And so the help that he gave you then during the time that your father was away was enough 
for you and your mother to– [talkover] 
 

A: Yes.  I also took a job.  I was a messe
nger boy up until 19– until the yellow star came into 
existence– ™44 March.  I was a messenger boy 
for architectural firm.  Because of the 
bicycle.  I could bicycle around then, so I wa
s delivering messages and things.  So, that 
supplemented also, my father™s salary which wasn™t a full salary, just part of it. 
 

Q: And as the war progressed, was the next signi
ficant event then, would have been the German 
occupation?  
 

A: Yes.  1944, March, if I reme mber it, 19
th
, is when the Germans had serious doubts 
apparently, that Hungary is not a trusted ally anymore, that Hungary probably entertains the 

idea of getting out of the war because by that 
time I think Romania was ready to jump and 
the situation in Italy was very shaky so they 
decided to occupy Hungary officially and put in 
a very right-wing government which was still a 
lot better than what came in 1944, October. 
That will be the other stage.  But let™s ta
ke a look at what happened when the Germans 
marched in, the yellow star had to be worn with
in a few weeks, or–  So, the labor battalions 
were more intensified.  Now everybody who wa
s eighteen had to go, that was now, they 
lowered the limit and the deportations started.  
So, unfortunately, that was the worst thing, 
the deportations.  They started in the country
side, eventually comi ng to Budapest.  They 
were supposed to come  to Budapest, you know, by the fall. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that your friends were deported one day.   

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: How did you ma nage to avoid being deported yourself?  

 

A: That was just an, a coincidence, that my aunt
, the one who gained this special status, said to 
me, ﬁPlease, I just have some very bad fee
lings, I don™t want you to 
go today out and work. 
Stay home, stay with me .ﬂ  She took me  to
 her apartment and that was the day when it 
happened.  It was just a, just a mi raculous instinct that she had.  And that is what saved me. 
 

Q: Did life take a turn after that, after the 
German occupation did you feel, were you able to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
17 
 
feed yourself and your mother adequately?  
 
A: Well, what I did was, I gathered,  I was always quite street smart and so I somehow found 
that the best way to do this whole thing is fi
rst to get some papers that would qualify usŠat 
least to those who don™t know usŠas Christians.  
So I took my mother™s jewellries, sold it, 
and bought papers.  And the papers were blank 
and you had to fill it out.  And I did that. 

Also, I got some papers and I fill it out with th
e same  name  fr om a cousin of mi ne who was 
adopted but had birth certificate a
nd everything else that pertained to the fact that he was a 
Gentile.  And his parents gave me his papers
 too so I had kind of this double insurance, 

moving around, in case I needed it.  For a while, 
I did not use these papers.  I waited until, 

you know, we got the point where it was necessar
y.  Also, there was a danger that until the 
Russian troops did not cross the Hungarian border, it was a matter of a telephone call to find 

out if you had false birth certificates.  All th
ey had to do is call the principality, you know, 
and that, that municipality a
nd check, okay? And so, actually, we waited until practically the 

first village fell and, after that, it was much easier 
to fill it out, to a town 
or a village that had, 
that was already occupied under occu– Sovi
et occupation because they couldn™t check 
anymore. 
 

Q: And after that point, did you use those papers?  

 

A: Then, then, then we used the papers for aw
hile, but it was a, it was very confusing period 
when we were moving a lot.  First, my wife, my
 mother and I moved to the, the apartment of 
one of my father™s friends.  They were Seve
nth-Day Adventists.  And they offered their 

place but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adve
ntists are just in the same danger as Jews 
so after consultation, we left.  Then we were
, we went to a, I was always on the street, 
hearing, feeling, looking, what can happen?  Then
 I took my mother to a Jewish high school 
which was designated as a clothing supply busine
ss for the Hungarian army and it was really 
a refuge for, for Jews.  They were sewing 
uniforms for the army and it was established by 
old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to
 save their skin and their family and hired 
fake guards in uniform to come  in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they 

were actually really making, sewing uniforms and 
delivering it to the army and, and, so I was 
always, it was just constantly you had to cha
nge your position and you had to always look at 

what seems safe at the moment.  And it is po
ssible that something that was safe one week 
became unsafe the next week because some body 
recognized one person in that place when 
he was walking down the street, going into plac
es, ﬁHere is a Jew, doesn™t wear a yellow 
star, what is he doing? ﬂ And so, your life depended on nuances, those days. 
 

Q: So you just took off the yellow star?  

 

A: My aunt is the one who just ripped off the 
yellow star and said, ﬁYou stay with me ,ﬂ and 
then my mother came there, too.  And this is 
how we got to this house in Zichy Jeno Street, 
One, in the Fifth District of Budapest. 
 

Q: Now, I think before you even moved into that
 house, there had been a lot of Allied bombings 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
18 
 
. . . 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Had there not?  Of Budapest?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So where were you during that time?  

 

A: We ll, we, whenever there was a, up until we 
had to leave our own apartment, when there 
was a bombing we lived in the cellar, you know, sometimes for hours.  But usually, the 

bombings came at night, so, I, one thing that
 war taught me how to be very organized 
because there was no light.  You 
couldn™t turn on the light. No, that was a ma jor offense.  If 
they saw any light, when the sirens went off,
 they, they considered you collaborating with 
the, with the enemy, you know, giving signals.  So, I had to lay out all my stuff and in the 

darkness I could pick every one of my clothe
s and still do, to run down.  We  had seconds to 
run down in the bombing, started.  Usually, 
there was no really intense bombing of 
Budapest.  Most of the bombers, ma ny times, Am
ericans, were flying over to Romania, to 
Ploe
ti, to bomb the oil fi elds.  There was really 
not much to bomb in Budapest, was not very 
badly bombed.  Budapest was, Budapest was 
mainly destroyed during that siege from 
December until January 18.  That was the main r
eason for the destruction.  But before that, 
there was not that much. 
 

Q: So, when was it that you moved in with your aunt?  

 

A: It was late fall, in 1944, you know.  Late fall th
at– when we felt that that place was the best 
place to be.  And then it turned 
out to be a very fortunate choice because in that house, there 
was a famous Hungarian psychiatrist.  Psychiat
ry was, in Hungary, at the very, very early 

stage.  This ma n became very famous and sin
ce there weren™t too many, 
a great deal of his 
clientele were famous politicians, actors, actre
sses, writers.  So he was well-known all over 
the place and he had this idea that he is going 
to save his family and friends by number one, 
contacting a fascist officer and I™ve no idea how he did it, who wants to save his skin and is 

willing to play this game of declaring the 
house a clinic and, and do everything possible to 
save the people inside the house and then he 
found this ma n and his name  was Jereczian Ara 
George.  And this is in reverse order because H
ungarian names are in reverse order.  The last 
name is what we consider first so in Eng
lish you would say George Ara Jereczian.  The, I 
remember him, a very handsome man, a very, ki
nd of a ma n of stature and a fascist uniform, 

hand grenades hanging from his belt.  I mean, he
 was intimidating to anyone.  To, with us, he 
was very kind.  The, I suppose, looking back that we about three hundred doctors and 

families in that apartment house jammed, abso
lutely jammed.  While we could still live 
upstairs, probably there were at least five to 
ten people to a room.  When we lived in the 
basement, no one is to tell, we were just side
 by side on mattresses because when the siege of 
Budapest started, you couldn™t live upstairs anymor
e.  So this ma n moved in with a few of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
19 
 
his men who apparently were loyal to hi
m and his girlfriend and they set up their 
headquarters there and they were practically 
like a, a, a support group.  The clinic had its 
official emblem there and the whole operati
on looked like it was a legal operation to save 
anybody who is injured.  ‚Kay?   Now, we™re at the end?  
 

Q: Why don™t we pause here?  I™d like to ask you some  more . . . 

 

A: Okay.

Tape 2, Side B 
 
Q: Okay.  We ™re on tape two, side B of an inte
rview with Mr. Robert Ho
lczer.  And if we can 
just go back a little bit and I™d
 like to know something about during the, you mentioned that 
you stopped going to school at a certain point and 
I wanted to hear about what you did with 
your days at that time.  When was that exactly?  
 

A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me .  
After I finished what would be eighth grade 
here, it was the fourth grade of mi ddle school and I was supposed to then go to what they 

call gymnasium, which is high school in Europe.  
 I could not get into a high school and so it 

was not a long period but between 1944, I have to
 figure this out.  Let™s see, 1925, 40, right. 
So there was a year, ™43 because I was, I left 
the school, ™43 so I had one year when actually 
I didn™t do much except odd jobs.  My father
 was away, so, as I me ntioned before I 
delivered, worked for an architectural firm and 
delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I 
could not get into high school.  The higher four
 grades of high school, the gymnasium.  And 

so my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the time I would be available for high 

school, I wouldn™t mi ss much.  And this is 
why I had a private tutor.  I was studying 
especially Latin because everybody suggested 
that that would probably create a problem 
when all of a sudden I, war would be overŠ
we were always optimistsŠand I could go to, 
instead of the first form to the second form a
nd Latin would create the biggest problem.  So 
for Latin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother™s distant family, who lived 

in Budapest.  And this is how 
the year went by.  There was really not much else, a little work 
and a little study. 
 

Q: At that time, was, were you and your mother 
aware of the so-called Final Solution and what 
was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?  
 

A: Yes.  My mother some how, well, first of all 
the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what 
happened to the Jews who were taken away to
 concentration camps and death camps but by 
the that time it was well known in Hungary too, 
what the deportations, how the deportations 
end up.  So my mother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to 

kind of keep her spirit up and, constantly remi ndi
ng her that there are certain things we can™t 
change and she still has to live for her own little 
immediate family.   But yes, we were very 
much aware, very much aware.  And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and 

up until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC. 

And I learned from my father, I 
was six years old when I learned from my father that there is 
more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio.  He would close the 

shutters at certain times, he always changed 
the times, of course, he would lock the doors 
and he would listen to BBC.  At a very early age and would tell me that this is the truth. 

Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on 

top of a car, similar probably to what radar is 
today, that would circle and try to find people 
who listened to foreign broadcasts.  And it was punishable also by going to concentration 

camp. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
21 
 
Q: And yet, despite your awareness of what 
was happening elsewhere 
in Europe, you and your 
mother remained, or at least your mother re
mained optimistic enough to find you a tutor and 
to . . .  
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  [talkover]  We ll, I think this is 
in the Jewish nature, if 
you consider the fact that 
people in boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right?   It™s just that, this 

part of the, of the optimism a
nd the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn.  That was 
with us.  That kind of a feeling never left us and we never really gave up. 
 

Q: Was your tutor Jewish?  

 

A: Yes, yes, yes.  She was.  And she was just
 a distant cousin of my, my mother and she, I 
eventually met her when I was in Israel, again. She emigrated to Israel. 
 

Q: And, were, well let™s just go forth to the, 
okay, let™s go back to your, your  home with your 
aunt that you had moved into several months after the German occupation and you had 

begun to describe to me this house, and the 
ma n who had been a me mber of Arrow Cross 
who had established it as a clinic.  And as, as
 it was established as a clinic, did the same 
people who had been living in it before, did some  
of them move out or have to leave or just 
more people came? 
 

A: No, those who were in the house, they we
re allowed to stay, which is obvious, I me an, 
anybody who would have been tossed out would have
 had to go to the ghetto.  And it was, to 
most people, it was clear that eventually the 
ghetto is going to be annihilated.  There was no 
other way, since Budapest was surrounded by then
 by the Soviet forces, what else can you 
do with it?  They built a huge wooden wall ar
ound the ghetto and, according to the rumors, 
they would just detonate the whole thing or 
burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews 

survive if the siege had lasted another week or s
o.  The lucky thing is that
 they just ran out of 
time.  I, of course I was never in the ghetto, 
but no, those who were in the house, they could 
stay, and a lot of other families moved in, pr
actically all of them connected to famous 
Hungarian doctors. 
 

Q: Before the house was established as a clinic . . . 

 

A: It was a Jewish house. 

 

Q: It was a Jewish house . . . 

 

A: Yes.  It was a Jewish house.  It had, it was a designated Jewish house. 

 

Q: And who was living in your aunt™s apartment with you?  

 

A: Well, about at least ten other members of our 
family.  Some  other aunts and brothers of my 
father, my mother, of course, and I.  I say, a
nd it was a, about one and a half room apartment 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
22 
 
and there were plenty of people in it.  But that
 was the, the least of our problems, really, you 
know.  We could, we could sleep very well.  There were a lot worse arrangements in 
Budapest at that time.  There were, there we
re people in Swedish-protected houses in, near 
the Danube, where, I understand, people couldn™
t even sleep.  They just were, you know, 
practically back to back in a room, there we
re so many people jammed in.  This is the one 
that Wa llen– what was his name, the Swedish 
diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his 
little area, Raoul Wallenberg.  But I never, I we
nt a couple of times by, but I never went up 
but I noticed that there just, there were just lots of lots of people. 
 

Q: And then this house, before it was established as a clinic, were there non-Jews living as 
well? 
 

A: Yes.  Yes.  And interestingly, I can reme mb
er that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed 
there.  They just stayed there.  By that time, perhaps what went through their mi nd is, that, 

since the war inevitably is comi ng to an end, it™
s not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet 
troops come.  So that must have been th
eir reasoning.  And it was not, not impractical, 
actually.  At the same time, even in the last 
week, we were in danger of being taken to the 
Danube, that was the, the most common way of
 getting rid of Jews who were discovered 
outside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the 
river.  It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter 
and the Danube was red and full of corpses.  
But I remember that even the last week, 
some body from the neighborhood reported us to th
e fascist authorities and they came and 
tried to disarm Jereczian Ara George™s ow
n people in the house, the bodyguards.  And he 
seemed, he almost seemed helpless.  We were already lined up and then he again arrived 

there, amazingly, he did this more than once, 
with some paper from a very special higher 
authority that said, ﬁClear out of here.  This 
is a protected territory and we do our job for the 
government and leave us alone.ﬂ  We confronted 
the ma n after the war.  I know that.  He was 
caught, the one who reported us because he 
was stupid enough to show up the last week 
before Budapest was, Pest was occupied, and 
pointed fingers.  I also remember another man 
who was a fascist officer that lived a couple 
of houses across from us who was also quite 
antagonistic toward us and we were worried about him.  And also the last week, they brought 

him in with a head injury.  He was shot in
 the head in the street fighting.  There was 
tremendous street fighting and he was just left
 there to die.  And I don™t know, I was just 
fascinated by, by this ma n that, that everybody 
was always afraid of and here he was, 
basically a nothing anymore, you know.  And in 
spite of my good judgement, I watched him, 
kept going back to him, as a young man all night
, watch him how he was dying.  And I can™t, 
I still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn™t look at another human 

being, even an animal that is dying.  But so
me how, there was a mi xed feeling in me  of 
revenge and satisfaction that this scum is, is 
not going to be here any longer and I wanted to 

see how he was going.  And my mother, I reme mb
er scolded me for this and constantly was 
taking me back to our place, where we, our sleepi
ng arrangeme nt was.  But, there, there were 
incidents like this and it was a very, very stra
nge period for a fifteen-
year-old boy.  My job 
was basically to take legs and arms up that
 were cut off, operated on in the so-called 
operating room which was a, a dark part of the 
baseme nt and kind of arrange them on the, in 
the courtyard.  And when in, when in January 18
th
, we went up, upstairs, everybody was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
23 
 
horrified.  There were huge piles of limbs just
 piled up on the courtyard.  And most of it, I 
had to pile up because I was the one who was 
always sent up with these.  The doctors 
operated without any anesthesis [sic], anythi
ng.  There were, there were, there was nothing 
and it, of course, the survival ratio probabl
y was mi nima l, you know.  But that, whenever I 
look into that house, that always comes to my
 mi nd, how these houses survive.  We die but 
they keep their secrets. 
 
Q: Had any of the other people who were living in
 your aunt™s apartment, did they have papers, 
false papers?  
 

A: I have a feeling that most of them did becau
se my father™s brothers wore the uniform of a 
military police and again, because of their, 
their origin from this working, workers™ 
neighborhood, they got papers and they got unifo
rms.  They were supplied with everything, 
both of them.  So. 
 

Q: Were you using your papers at the time?  

 

A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me  and asked for papers.  That was the 
only time I used mi ne.  And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn™t mean 

anything if they stopped a ma n because they di
dn™t even ask for papers.  They asked for you 
to drop your pants.  And sin
ce in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to 

detect who was a Jew.  And I have to thank, 
I mean my life was really saved by a ma n who, 
amazingly appeared at the time when I thought that
 this was my last moment on earth.  I was 
sent out to get something, I think, if I remember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell 

on the street from shrapnels and we needed
 some  meat.  And the only kind of me at, 
whenever we had meat, the only meat that 
we could get was horseme at.  And of fallen 
horses, horses that were shot on the street, usua
lly by airplanes.  Airplanes flew very low and 
they were just machine-gunning anything that moved.  And I always ran out and I also 

crawled out to get water.  There were certain
 areas where a faucet was still intact and you 
could get some water.  And a patrol came a
nd caught me  and they said, ﬁOkay, here, come , 
come  into the doorway of this house,ﬂ and th
ey were shouting, yelling, ﬁThis looks like a 

Jew and took off your pants, take off your pants,
ﬂ and they give me the order and I was kind 
of snow-white probably and shaking and all 
of a sudden another ma n with a much higher 
rank came and said to the guys, ﬁLook, I see four, 
five Jews on that corner.  Go imme diately, 
see, catch those, I take care of this idiot he
re.  And so we went under the doorway and I was 
unbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking and he
 said, ﬁListen,ﬂ he said, ﬁare you crazy? ﬂ 
He said, ﬁI don™t know where you come  from, 
do you have a place where you were staying? ﬂ 
I said yes.  He said, he said, ﬁGo back and 
I don™t ever want to see 
you again on the street.ﬂ 
And we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and just and he said to these people, 

ﬁThis idiot, he™s not a Jew,ﬂ he said, ﬁhe™s 
an idiot, a young idiotic kid who wants to be a 
hero apparently.  Go back to your mother and don™t ever leave the house.ﬂ   And I told my 

mother this story and of course, she never let 
me, the last week she never let me leave the 
place, under no circumstances.  And interestingl
y, about four, five weeks after we were 
liberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
24 
 
committee of the Jewish Relief and you could 
go there and you could get some emergency 
supplies, food supplies, they were bringing th
em in.  And who was at
 the door letting people 
in?   I recognized this man.  And I walked up to
 him, he had a huge, a 
big flag emblem on his 
lapel, the flag of what today is Israel, at th
at time it was a Zionist emblem.  And I said to 
him, I said, ﬁHey, you know, you saved my life? ﬂ 
And he looked at me , he said, ﬁYou too? ﬂ 
He said, ﬁThere were ma ny more.ﬂ  And turne
dŠhe didn™t really want me to elaborate or 
nothing.  And there were many people like this.  
Now who they were, I was very curious and 
I went to find out and most of the people who 
were doing this were Polish Jews because a lot 
of them had very fair complexions.  They we
re blond and blue-eyed and so, and they came  
to Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, fi
ve years, they learned enough Hungarian, and 
good Hungarian so they had very little accent and 
they could pass as, there were other people 
in the Arrow Cross moveme nt who had accents, so
 quite a few of them were in the Arrow 
Cross moveme nt.  And in the Zionist Undergr
ound so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident for 

me .  
 

Q: How did you get food during that time?  

 

A: During the siege?  Well, during the siege . . . 

 

Q: Well, I™m sorry, not only during the siege but
 during the time of the establishment of the 
clinic. 
 

A: Oh, well they, they did it, the, the man 
I told you who saved us, he had good source of 
supply.  So, there was always a center of supply. 
 The only thing that we could not get was of 
course, what did we get, flour 
and beans.  These were the two and soya.  People ma de, there 
was incredible things out of soyabeans.  I have great respect for soyabeans.  They made 

sausage, they made, you name it, and it all 
tasted like real sausage or soyabread was 
ma rvelous.  And they ma de bread of rice and just
 invented all kinds of things that they had 

never eaten before.  But the, the big thing wa
s meat.  Everybody wanted to have meat so we 
always watched out, looked out for horses, horse
s.  And you should have seen, when a horse 
fell on the street, ah, everybody was running w
ith huge knives and carving it out and running 
back into the baseme nt because . . . 
 

Q: People wearing the stars at that time?  [talkover] 

 

A: No, nobody in, nobody, nobody in this house wore 
stars.  Okay?  Nobody, that was a taboo. 
No.  And that was his order.  ‚K
ay? We were exempt, because a lot of things that he told us, 
it was not true, it was just to boost our confid
ence but by that time there was such confusion 
everywhere, in higher governme nt places that who, who knows what was really the truth and 

what was not?   Only he can. 
 

Q: So he would distribute the food and then everybody would take it back to their apartments–  

 

A: No, no.  We  did, we had pretty good organization.  No, he was the one who secured the food 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
25 
 
by, you know, sending a contingent of people to, 
to get it and then we brought it back and 
then we, we divided it.  He had his little place 
there and he was just, these are all intelligent 
people and very disciplined people.  He did not have to go down personally and do anything, 
really.  All we needed him for is to, to, to help
 us survive, to, to protect us from the outside 
world. But inside, we organized everything ourselves. 
 

Q: Wa s everybody who lived in the building in some  way involved [talkover] 

 

A: Some  way, yes. Yes.  They had to.  They had to, they did some thing.  Okay, at least, if 
nothing else on paper.  My mother was a nurse, for example. 
 

Q: And your only job was to take these limbs?  

 

A: We ll, I was, what they called, I was a me ssenger, you know, I was an errand boy.  I was 
fi ft een, and so, that was, I had a little uniform 
and a gray overall with a, kind of a military 
cap.  But I was in charge of taking the, the severed things up. 
 

Q: Did you have any friends in the building?  

 

A: I, did I have, yes, I had a friend.  And it was th
e first time in my life that I really felt a sexual 
attraction toward a woman.  And I was kind of a cute little kid and she was a lot older than I. 

And I think under different circumstances, proba
bly, we would have been much cozier but it 

was, there were too many people around.  I liked he
r.  She was a, believe it or not, there was 
a, among other things, there was a famous Hunga
rian Jewish comedian who also ended up in 
our, in our place.  Alphonso.  And this was th
e other half of his act, a young woma n.  And 
we became good friends and I had all kinds of fa
ntasies about her and maybe she, too, about 
me.  But my mother was around and too many pe
ople and so our attraction never really came 
to anything else, but just that.  But we spent 
a lot of time together and, and, and it was just a 
nice puppy love, I think, that I™ve had for the fi
rst time in my life w
ith an older, somebody 
was at that time older, not too old.  I think she 
was in her early twenties or so, but I was just 
fifteen.  And the, I also had a strange relati
onship with an Italian girl.   The Italian 
governme nt of Badoglio 
(ph)
, that was his name , his Air Fo
rce chief I think, or Air Force 
mi nister had a Hungarian Jewish wife and when
 things got very hot in Italy, he brought her 
back to Hungary because he felt that in Hunga
ry she has a better chance of survival, being 
the wife of the famous Italian Air Force general.  In Italy, everybody knew that she was 

Jewish and they were afraid of deportation.  
So, and he had a daughter, and some how I had a 
lot of friends in the Italian school in Budapest
, the Italian embassy maintained a school.  And 
I fell in love with this girl. 
 And the stupid thing, the reason this ties in with this story, the 
stupid I did was, during the terribl
e, during those terrible days of siege, whenever I had some 
food like horsemeat or some thing, I would walk, 
they lived about a half an hour from our 
house and I would walk on the street, of course 
walk, try to run from 
one block to another, 
very close to the walls to deliver food to this gi
rl and to her mother.  And, and I felt that this 
was my obligation and it was a stupid thing to do.

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape three, side A of an interv
iew with Mr. Robert Holczer.  Am I pronouncing your 
name correctly?   
 

A: Holczer. 

 

Q: Holczer.  Holczer.  I™m interested in h
earing, you were just describing some  of your 
friendships to me and I™m interested in hear
ing what you did for entertainment, how you, if 
you ma naged to find any game s to play or ways to have fun?  
 

A: Well, if I remember correctly, we did not 
play any games because the day went by with 
constantly watching out to survive.  We watc
hed the streets, we listened to the radio.  I 
remember that I was terribly concerned with 
the expression of adults around me , I watched 
their faces.  I always suspected that they 
know more than what they would tell me  and 
some how, in the last few weeks, I just became obs
essed with, with this business of survival. 
I couldn™t think of anything else and my uncle
, who is, the one who is still alive, remi nded 
me that my constant question to him was, pr
actically hourly, ﬁHow long will this last?  How 
long will this last? ﬂ This was my constant que
stion.  I was just counting the hours.  We knew 
that the, that the streetfighting between the 
Germans and the Russians cannot be more than a 
couple of city blocks away.  We  saw German
 soldiers, injured, moving down the street and 
we heard, practically, the gunfire as if it were 
next to us.  Some  people came in injured who 
reported that just a couple of blocks from us 
there were already Russian soldiers so it was 
that, that, that tension that kept me from doi
ng anything else except just waiting for that final 
onslaught when I can see that our area is liberat
ed.  There was just no mood for playing.  We  
were not children.  None of us were children. 
 We were, all our conversations, I remember, 
with the, with the kids of my age down th
ere, all, everything was always revolving around 
survival.  
 

Q: So even before the, the actual siege you didn™t have?  

 

A: No, before the actual siege, yes, I, i still 
contacted sometimes my old Boy Scout comr ades, 
they were the ones that I kept up with.  But on
ce of course, the siege started then, there was 
no chance to, to go out and do anything like that. 
 

Q: So some  of your, your Boy Scout comr ades had escaped the deportation?  

 

A: Oh yes, well, reme mber these were not school
, these were not school people, I told you that. 
No, these are all from various, the Boy Sc
out group, the membership consisted of people 
from anywhere in Budapest and for various area
s and quite a few of them survived.  So, even 
after the war, of course, we met for awhile a
nd then we decided there is nothing in it for us 
anymore and that™s when I joined the Zionist M
ovement.  That gave me a lot more important 
goals than the Boy Scouts. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
27 
 
Q: The, the Boy Scouts, your friends from the Boy Scouts weren™t in the ghetto then.   
 

A: No.  Some  of them did go in, you know, some  of
 them did go in.  But others weren™t.  And 
so we communicated and visited with a couple of, who were outside. 
 

Q: You would go to each other™s home? 

 

A: Yes. Yes. Strictly, you know, strictly so.  
We didn™t want any conversation, any, any public 
place that can be overheard.  Because our main 
concern was the kind of topic that others 
shouldn™t hear. 
 

Q: Such as what? 

 

A: Well, where are the Russian forces?  What did 
you hear?  All this.  What did the radio say?  
We didn™t have any radios, the Jews, right?  
But those who were hiding, and were perhaps 
with a Christian family, they could still listen 
to BBC so that was the, the entire existence 

was the war and the topics were just that. 
 

Q: Now the, the clinic, what, who were the pe
ople that the clinic would treat? Was it just 
anyone who would happen to be injured?  
 

A: Well, theoretically, we were supposed to treat 
fascist officials according to all the papers and 
the, the permit that our leader, you know, had.  
But there was such chaos in the last few 
weeks, you know, when the siege of Budapest 
started, that we treated everybody who came 
in from the street who was injured.  And it wa
s pathetic, sometimes, that people would come 
in with some very mi nor problems and leave 
the clinic, and within mi nutes they were 
brought back with, with practically their guts out. 
 In other words, in order to reach us, they 
went through such danger that they lost their lives, eventually.  We had, we had no medicine 

left, we had practically nothing.  So we 
couldn™t do much.  Anybody, anybody was treated. 
And doctors are doctors.  I was always interest
ed in, especially when there was a fascist 
official, what did they do to hi
m?  Would they take advantage of the fact that here we are, 
you know, lost all family members and all this, but 
I talked to, this interested me and I talked 
to some of the doctors and they said there™s no such thing, a doctor cannot do that.   
 

Q: Did the clinic work with any of the other rescue organizations in any way?  

 

A: No, we didn™t.  By that time, there was no 
contact, nothing.  Everybody™s out for, for itself. 
There was, there was just, everything collapsed. 
 The streets were ruled by twelve year old 
children with submachine guns and disenfrised [sic], uneducated laborers who never 

amounted to anything, and this was their way to 
get their revenge.  They were shooting first, 
truly and asking questions after.  It was, it was the, a total reign of terror. 
 

Q: What about before the siege, siege?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
28 
 
A: Before the siege, it was already leading up to
 this because they, as soon as the Arrow Cross 
movement took over on October 15, the, they starte
d.  It was just as bad.  And the mi nute the 
admi ral who was the head of Hungary, Admi ra
l Horthy finished his speech in which he 
announced that as far as he was concerned  
the war was lost, at that moment, you know, hell 
broke loose.  He was arrested, his bodyguards were arrested. 
 
Q: And you, as soon as that, that date, October 15, you just didn™t go outside anymore?  

 

A: No, well, we, that was the date when the house,
 the story I told you began to get, take shape, 
okay?   This was when we kind of put our heads t
ogether and we learned that this psychiatrist 
is taking steps to bring this man in and all this
.  We had to act very quickly because events 

were really comi ng to an end.  The Russians 
were approaching Budapest rapidly and we 
knew that again, that gives the, these guys very
 little time to kill all of us.  And they were 
getting more and more vicious, amazingly.  Inst
ead of saving their skin, they became even 
more violent. 
 

Q: Okay, so, before the siege, and you were some times going out . . . 

 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: You would deliver me ssages?  

 

A: Right, right.  I had, you know, th
e uniform and the ID and all this.  I was sent to get our 
rations, you know, I was sent to pick up some papers or pick up medicine.  Yeah, I was just a 

. . . 
 

Q: But you had no contact with the Red Cross or with the different legations. 

 

A: Well, the, the Red, if I remember correctly, 
we had some , some  very vague contact with the 
Red Cross, I probably picked up me dicine fr
om them or something for the, for the 
organization.  But personally, I had no as a, as an
 individual, I had no contact other than with 
the, just with the Swiss Embass
y.  I told you I had a Switz, Swiss 
schutzpass
, that by the time 
the Arrow Cross movement started, meant very little. 
 
Q: How did you, how did you get that 
schutzpässe
? 
 

A: We ll, you could go to the Swedish Embassy 
or the Swiss Embassy and they would, put you 
on the list and eventually would give it to you. 
 And it was really just a, kind of a, a 
smokescreen.  There was not much, if you were 
lucky, they respected it and they let you go. 
If you were unlucky, they just tore it apart 
and said, ﬁStep into the wagon,ﬂ you know, and 
you were gone.  You could never, never know. It
, those embassies issued this in good faith 
but the people who looked at it, you were at the 
me rcy of those.   And I just happened to go 
to the Swiss one, but the Swedish did it and th
en probably you heard the story, the Japanese, 
it was a Japanese in, in, not in Hungary, I thi
nk it was in Lithuania or somewhere, did the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
29 
 
same  thing. 
 
Q: Yes. 

 

A: So, in Hungary, it was ma inly the Swedish a
nd the, and the Swiss and I think the Vatican 
too.  There was some, even though that the Primate of Hungary was almost like a 

collaborator.  He did not really act very courageously under the Nazi era.   
 

Q: Do you reme mber when the siege began?  

 

A: Yes.  It was in December, if I know, December 20
th
 or something, very close to Christmas. 
That™s when it– really, it just, all of a sudden 
we were shot at from every direction.  We 

knew that Budapest was totally surrounded.  The 
airplanes were just comi ng day and night. 
They were called ratas, R, A, T, A, thes
e small Soviet airplanes machine-gunning anything 
on the street that moved.  It was very dangerous 
to get out on the street. 
 And of course, then, 
when it came to night, anybody was moving could ha
ve been also shot by the fascists, by the 
Arrow Cross people, ‚cause they were also m
oving.  And it, it was a lo
t of noise, a lot of 
injuries, a smell of, of the 
stench of, of gunpowder and, and corpses came closer, you know?  
War has a certain smell, a very very unpleasan
t smell that you can really honestly feel.  And 
as a child, I learned that.  That™s, that™s all I can tell you, but . . . 
 

Q: Now, so the entire building then moved down into the baseme nt?   

 

A: Yes, the entire Budapest lived in basements.  Some of the newer houses™ basements were 
clean, perhaps dry, you know.  And you could ma
ke it with a little effort to become 
temporary living quarters.  But those built in the 19
th
 century, they were damp, dark, they 
were just awful.  Cold.  And luckily, that this 
house, this Zichy Jeno Street was a fairly, fairly 
new house.  And the basement was livable.  Now 
where I lived, where I lived before, in most 
of my life, back, that baseme nt was such th
at I, oh, I wouldn™t have wanted to spend any 
time right there because it was a damp, old t
ypical, what you see almost in Dickensian, you 
know, movies or read about Dickensian novels.  
Also, there were rats, loved this kind of a 
moist dark environment.  But here, I remember 
our basement as quite civilized in, in this 
house.  So it was, the hardship was not really
 bad and so ma ny people, the heat, I think, of 
the bodies ma de up for the cold outside.   
 

Q: How ma ny people were there?  

 

A: Oh, I would say we were a few hundred people in that baseme nt, yeah?  

 

Q: How big was the baseme nt?  

 

A: Oh, it, it would be like a floor, an entire fl
oor of the house, because it was, usually the 
baseme nts were what you can consider a low floor. 
 So, it™s, I cannot really describe it in, in 
square footage because at that time I didn™t ev
en, I didn™t even know about that, but it, it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
30 
 
a good size apartment house floor, okay, just pict
ure it.  And there were mattresses down, 
and everybody brought the ma ttresses down, and th
ere were people very closely situated 
and, was in a way, it was kind of a warm place. 
 

Q: Were there separate rooms?  

 

A: There were a few, but mainly the separate
 rooms were, were given to the doctors for 
operation, operating rooms and, and supply rooms a
nd things like that.  Most of the people 
lived in, in these big open areas. 
 

Q: So the treatments continued, then?  

 

A: Yes, yes, yes.  Up until the, practically th
e last mi nute.  And then the liberation, January 18, 
is when we heard the emergency wall of our 
baseme nt.  We  heard a knock and by law, there 
was a, an emergency entrance to every one 
of these baseme nts between two houses that 
consisted only of one layer of bricks.  So, and ther
e had to be a pick next
 to it.  So we heard 
that a pick was working, breaking through.  And 
then, must have been about four o™clock, 
five o™clock in the morning and all of a sudde
n the furred hat half of a young Russian soldier, 
Soviet soldier, came through first and then the whole body.  And this was first time, I think, 

that he got a hug from people because, and he
 couldn™t understand why, he was absolutely 
bewildered because, of course, the Soviet soldie
rs were not welcomed with great enthusiasm 
anywhere since most Hungarians were hoping for 
a German victory and  we, we were just 
hugging and kissing him. 
 

Q: Before we go forward, you, so the treatme nt
s continued but so, some body was actually was 
going out onto the streets during that time and . . . 
 

A: We  were, yeah, bringing in people from just
 the vicinity, okay, very close vicinity.  And 
people would come  in on their own too, you know, 
with a, with a shrapnel or something in 
their leg or a small injury. 
 

Q: And was some body going out to get food?  

 

A: Well, we had beans.  We, we, I remember th
at we practically had beans every day.  Beans, 
beans and beans.  As long as you have beans, you 
can really survive.  And water, yeah, water 
was dripping but still, we could get at enough 
water to, for drinking.  Nobody took a shower, 
that™s for sure.  There was no way. 
 

Q: Was there a place to cook in the, in the basement?  

 

A: Yep.  People had these little, you know, stoves. 
 A lot of people had little stoves and they 
shared those, whole families.  There was, amazingly, it was a very peaceful environment 

because we all, we only had one important thing in our mi nd, to get out of there, alive.  And 

people shared. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
31 
 
 
Q: So everybody ma naged to get along [talkover]?  

 

A: Yes, nobody, there was no such thing as 
leaving some body starving or leaving some body 
without fuel, or, I remember that everybody was doing their best.  And of course, there are 

small little skirmi shes mainly a couple of old 
people who just didn™t understand the situation 
completely, and had unreasonable demands or so
mething and we had to step on their toes, 
and–  But no basic, no, no big problems.   
 

Q: How ma ny doctors would you say there were out of that . . . 

 

A: It™s hard for me  to look back but I would say we
 had at least thirty doctors there, at least. 
And we are talking about the cream of, of th
e Hungarian Jewish doctors, you know?   Really, 
they went out and fa mous professors fr om 
universities so this man, this Doctor Völgyessi
3
 
who was the psychiatrist living in the house origin
ally, he had a very large circle of friends, 
and so he managed to gather the ones that he
 could and brought them in.  And there were 
many other people, I don™t know how they got there.  I just read a few years ago that the 

chief architect of Budapest, the main archit
ect of Budapest today, was with me  in the 

basement in this house.  I– somebody sent me
, I think, a newspaper article or while in 
visiting in Budapest I saw it, he gave an in
terview about it.  Because it was the fiftieth 
anniversary of the liberation of Budapest this year.   
 

Q: Was Jereczian still in, still with you at that point, at the point of the siege?  

 

A: Jereczian? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Oh he stayed, he stayed all the time, he stay
ed, he never left the place.  Yeah.  So, no, he was 
there all the time.  And if he had to leave fo
r some reason, he made sure that he left enough 
people there to, to protect us. 
 

Q: So he had ma de just a complete break from the Arrow Cross?  

 

A: Yes, apparently, apparently and why he even 
joined them and what was his job there, I don™t 
know.  I don™t know.   Since I left in 1948, you know, and I think that probably it took a few 

years to write about these things and clear up this
 thing and I was not there in these, from ™48 
to ™50.  And after I came back, you just didn™t want to, those were the worst years of 

Stalinism and you didn™t want to get involve
d with anything because you didn™t know what 
he was doing at that time and so, no questions as
ked was the best policy.  But, later on in the 

sixties and seventies, I heard that he was a 
concert impressario and that he took certain 
shows back to Budapest.  And I even saw his na
me and I am, I really regret that I didn™t go

to see him.  I should have looked for him somehow
 and talked to him.  So I feel so strongly 
about this whole thing that if I knew today that
 he is still alive, living, I would probably go to 
Vienna.  That™s where he lived and, and, and 
just thank him again.  But I know that he 
received a great deal of recognition from people.  But I know, I don™t 
know exactly what, if 
he™s alive today.  He was, I would say, about ten, 
at least ten, fifteen years older than I, so it™s 
hard to say. 
 

Q: Well, let™s go back to the, to the liberati
on.  So there™s a Russian soldier who broke through 
and you all embraced him and then, and then what did you do?  
 

A: What did I do after that?   Well, I did what probably is a natural thing to do.  I went with the 
Russian soldiers and whenever they broke into 
a store and they broke into every store that 
still had anything, I went with them.  And af
ter they were through and took what they 
wanted to take, I took what I wanted to ta
ke.  In other words, I did what we called 
zabralny
 
which means to confiscate things.  I was full of
 hate, I was full of frustration and I thought 
this, this was the way to get even, probably. 
 And, I had a little store at home, a kind of a 

little supply of all these stolen goods that I got fr
om shops that were just there, most people 
wouldn™t dare to go in with the Russians, but I 
put back my yellow star and I went with them 
and unless I bumped into some Ukrainians, who were famous anti-Semites and beat the hell 

out of you, the, the others, they, they were 
welcoming you.  They said go ahead.  Also, we 
had a, a little Jewish domestic fr om Romania w
ith us, who joined us and helped my, my 
mother and she also spent the last few months w
ith us in this, in this basement.  And she was 
from Roma nia and with the Russians we had 
Roma nian troops comi ng in.  And she was a 
beautiful young girl, nineteen, and the Roma nian 
officers were just, just absolutely crazy 
about her.  So she took me  by the hand and she 
said, ﬁCome with me .ﬂ  And she went with 
these Romanians to all the jewelry stores and sh
e amassed a fortune within days in jewelry. 
And then said goodbye to us and disappeared.  
We  never found out what happened to her. 

She had a fiancee in Roma nia, whether she f
ound him or not, we suspected she eventually 
ended up in Israel like most young people of that
 time.  But I went with her and Romanian 

officers, I went with Russians.  I was kind of a 
street urchin for awhile.  I enjoyed the fact 
that nobody, nobody can really give me any orders
.  And my mother could not control me 
either, you know?   I was now a ma n and I was ju
st intoxicated by this, and so I had a little 
store there, that, with all the stolen goods, a
nd my father saw this when he came home and 
found out, asked me  what happened and I told him.
   And he was absolutely just horrified 
that I would do something like this and made me take everything back to the stores where I 

got it from.  It was interesting, he got a little cart for me, we put everything on it and he came 

with me and he stayed outside and I had to 
deliver it back.  And I 
tell you, some  of those 
people could not believe that this happened.  
And today, of course, I feel very good about 
this but not, not at that time.  
So, in, it took me only a year or two to realize that I, my real 
emotions that I™m not a Hungarian, I never 
had a Hungarian passport, you know?   I never 
had any, any identity, Hungarian identity.  The
y, I was always being denied of being a 
Hungarian even though my parents were born 
in Hungary and practically everybody back 
generations born in Hungary and so I joined 
the Zionist Moveme nt.  And in 1948, the, the, 
the Communists completely took over the governme
nt.  They called it the Year of Turn. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
33 
 
And all other organizations except for Comm
unist youth organizations were banned.  So 
again now I was in the underground Zionist organization.

Tape 3, Side B 
 
Q: Okay, so this is tape three, side B of an
 interview with Mr. Robert Holczer.  And will you 
describe to me your father™s homecomi ng, what that event was like for you and your mother?  

And your father?    
 

A: We ll, I told you, before, that, it, we knew because of an emissary that he had sent ahead of 
him who then by small dosage ma de
 us aware of the fact that he was alive, that he was 
comi ng, but of course, it was a tremendous emo
tional experience for him to appear there 
and, the fact that he immediately underst
ood why there are two families living in the 
apartment and, and, and accepted our decision, it 
was just a very nice homecomi ng.  Because 
number one, we saw him, number two he brought 
food, which helped us to have a little feast 
then, and number three is that he, we knew that
 that™s what he would have done, he would 
have split the living quarters and would not throw 
a fa mily of four, fa mily of fi ve who were 
out of their own, well, problems, housed in our 
place.  We– naturally, we were totally just 

overwhelmed by emotions for awhile and then, se
t out to see the rest of the family.  He 
wanted to see his brothers and sisters and, and, that™s, this is what happened.   
 

Q: So you had left, when did you, let™s go back a little bit again. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: You had left the, the house on Zichy Jeno Street. 

 
A: Yes.Zichy 
utca
.  Yeah, I left  it practically the day afte
r we were liberated and went back to 
see what happened to our apartment.  And that
™s where I found that family living in it. 
‚Kay?  And, then shortly we move
d back with my mother and so after a few months, I think it 
must have been April or May when my father finally appeared. 
 
Q: And you, during that few months, food was very scarce?  

 

A: It was, very scarce.  But again, this aunt of 
ours, of mi ne, who played such an important role 
in saving all of us, again, she and I, we team
ed up and went, which was very customary then 
for city people to do, took jewelry and possessi
ons of the family that we thought farmers 
mi ght like to have and we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty 

kilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest
, and exchange it for food.  We  also hired a 

person with a horse to drag it back to Budapest. 
 It was mainly fl our, lard, necessities, but of 

course, a horse was immediately a red flag i
n, in the eyes of the Russians because they 
confiscated every horse, everything that could 
be used for transporting their goods.  And we 
were caught mi dway between this place and 
Budapest, comi ng back, in a small Danubian 
village.  On the other side of the Danube, th
ere was a battle going on.  And we knew that it 
doesn™t affect anything, because the Danube is
 a very wide river and the Germans didn™t 
have any means to get over and why would they
 come over, but there was a battle over there 
because Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet.  
And so the Russians were very edgy and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
35 
 
confiscated the cart, they confis
cated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also 
incarcerated my aunt and myself.  And I ha
ve no idea what happened, but the next– my 
aunt was with me  in the room and the, the Ru
ssian captain came in and took her out and she 
came back a few hours later and she said, ﬁDon™
t worry, everything is going to be fine.ﬂ 
And the next morning, we were given back th
e cart, the horse, the man who was the owner 
of the horse and cart and the food and everythi
ng else and let go.  And I can only guess what 
was the price.  The only thing I regret is that 
we heard that after delivering the stuff to our 
home and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the 
cart went back, eventually, was caught and 
lost both.  So yes, if you had still some  
belongings that farmers would appreciate, you c
ould have food.  Because the farmers always 
have food. 
 

Q: How long did that cartful of food last you?  

 

A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, th
e UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations 
were also sending packages and, and would supply 
us regularly.  So that helped too.   We 
were not really, you know, in danger of, of starving to death. 
 

Q: And did you go back to school?  

 

A: Yes, I went back to school
, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high 
school at the age of eighteen.  
And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my 
Zionist Organization give me signals that it wa
s time to go to Israel because they couldn™t 
guarantee that we would have more time.  The Communist Police was and the border guards 

were really closing everything very tightly.  
So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to 
my family and get either an instrument or an
 instrument case, that was instruction number 
one.  Then I was called by my Zionist leaders a
nd, and asked if it is true that my mother 
come s from this northern Hungarian town, I said ye
s.  They said, ﬁDo us a favor.  Go to that 
town, introduce yourself as, so they can recogni
ze that you are, your mother is related,ﬂ and 
all this and that, ﬁand ask them if they would 
like to have a high school orchestra to play a 

concert in town.  And if they
 say yes,ﬂ Šwhich probably they would, they said, because 
which little town doesn™t like a fr ee concertŠ ﬁgo 
to a printer, here is money and have nice 
posters printed.ﬂ  And they give me the date.  I went, I talked to the mayor, he was 

overwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn™t realize at that time 

that this was the alibi just in case we would be
 caught because this town is on the way to the 
border, my mother™s birthplace.  On a given 
day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state-
owned bus by that time from a state-owned company.  We were all either holding an 

instrument or having an instrument case so 
people thought this was a high school orchestra 
and while singing Communist songs, 
we took off for the border.  On the border, when we got 
close to this town, we kept on going and the 
bus driver said that he was hungry, we were 
hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub 
or so and this was in 1948, February.  We  
were eating there and getting something to dri
nk and a woma n began to flirt with the bus 

driver.  And we were horrified because that
 would, everything woul
d cause a problem, we, 
we knew that we had a definite 
plan.  And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take

about a half an hour rest and my, our leader 
argued with him but he said, ﬁAll right, go.ﬂ 
And as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us 
and he said, ﬁGo across this field and there is 
a barn there and don™t ask any questions, just get into the barn.ﬂ  That™s what we did.  They 
closed the barn and around mi dnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly 

River which is the river between Czechoslova
kia and Hungary and to our great amazement, 
who was leading us? Šthe peasant woma n who was 
in the pub.  She shed her twelve skirts or 
so because those women still wore many, many skir
ts, this was the, the thing.  Now she had 

a leather jacket and blue jeans and she spoke He
brew with our leader.  She was a, an Israeli 
army officer, born to Hungarian parents who s
poke perfect Hungarian and this was her job, 
to distract.  And she led us down to the rive
r, everything was supposed to happen so that on 

the other side of the river, this was C
zechoslovakia and the reason we had to go to 
Czechoslovakia and not to Austria because 
the border between Austria and Hungary was 
already closed and tightly controlled but the C
zechs were still kind of in between this Year 
of Turn and the Democratic regime that was 
there before.  The, the end, at the end we 
crossed the river but instead of getting into the 
trucks, the border guards stayed and started to 
talk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground.  It 

was very cold in February, we were wet and 
we had to lie on the ground for about a half an 
hour when they finally left.  Then we coul
dn™t find a truck, the truck left, too, who was 
supposed to wait for us.  So it took us about a ha
lf a day to find it and, finally, we were taken 

to Bratislava, where the gendarmerie was paid
 off.  We were nominally arrested by the 
gendarmerie and he put into a warm place in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I 

remember, and the next morning, we were taken 
to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic] 
and within about a half an hour they opened.  
We were in Vienna, in the American section 
of, of, of Vienna.  At that tim
e, Vienna was divided.  So this was my, my great escape to 
Israel.  And from there on, of course, we were taken down and eventually ended up in Israel. 
 

Q: You me ntioned how you had joined this Zioni
st organization that you realized that you, you 
were not really a Hungarian citizen. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Was it the desire to have a place that led you to join the Zionist Organization?  

 

A: Yes.  I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I 
was among brothers and sist
ers and I feltŠat that 
time remember it was the last few weeks of th
e warŠthat I was, if I fought, I was going to 
fight for, for the Jewish homela
nd.  And I already associated myse
lf more with th
at than with 
Hungary.  That was, every young person needs 
a fatherland and that was mi ne, even though 
I™d never seen it before.  So, it was an emotiona
l thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two 
years. 
 

Q: How did your parents relate to your decision, to . . . 

 

A: Of course, they were very, very upset and ve
ry sad.  But I said, ﬁYou can come  and, and join 
me ,ﬂ you know.  And we agreed that they would 
but of course, they couldn™t, because after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
37 
 
we left, it was impossible to, to leave Hungary 
for awhile.  So, I corresponded and this was, 
this was one of the reasons why I returned ev
entually, in 1950 to Hungary, ‚cause I realized 
that I needed to make up for the years that my
 father was away.  So I returned to Hungary 
and it was the worst of the Stalinist era.  It was like 
1984
, it was terrible.   
 
Q: Did he, did your father iden
tify himself as a, did he feel a Hungarian nationalism in any 
way?  
 

A: No, my father never really made an issue out 
of this.  He never made an issue out of this, you 
know?   One way or another.  Just, he, he, he l
oved his environment, Budapest.  He loved to 

go to the coffee house and play cards with hi
s friends and drink coffee and, and, probably 
gossip or whatever, politics.  He loved that.  A
nd he told us a cute little joke.  They always 
asked him why doesn™t he follow me , when he 
was already alone, after my mother died and 
he, he said, ﬁI tell you a joke.ﬂ  He said, ﬁM
r. Kohn sits in this famous Hungarian coffee 
houseﬂŠit was called Hungaria, it™s a very famous, or New York, it had two name s.  New 

York before and after the German occupati
on, called Hungaria because you couldn™t give a 
place New York.  Anyway, Mr. Kohn sits there and people say, ﬁMr. Kohn, it is now the 

1940s, we are after the war, all your friends ar
e gone.  They™re all in New York, what are 
you doing here alone in the coffee house? ﬂ A
nd Mr. Kohn said, ﬁLook son, what would I 
have done had I also left for New York?  I woul
d have arrived there one day and the next day 
I would have looked for my ol
d friends and I would have found them and the third day we 

would have sat down to talk, 
about what?  The good old days in the coffee house.ﬂ  He said, 
ﬁLook son, I am already in the co
ffee house.ﬂ  And my father always said, ﬁThis is my coffee 
house.ﬂ  In other words, this was his life, 
this was his environment.  You know, he was 
always on his feet, he was always going around in
 Budapest and he was also working almost 
up to the last year just before he died.  He wa
s, he just couldn™t be 
without work.  He was a 
workaholic and he knew that in this count
ry, you need language.  And he had very poor 
language facilities, he would have never learned 
English.  So, it was a realization but we, we 
saw him as much as we could.   
 

Q: What did you do when you arrived in Israel?  

 

A: Basically, I spent most of my time in kibbutz, 
living in a kibbutz.  I l
earned to work with the 
tractors at that time, and then we, with
 a hundred other Hungarian, young Hungarian youth, 
most of them from my old organization from
 Hungary, we received land near the Jordanian 
border by a town called Afula and started our ow
n settlement.  So, I was really working the, 
as a farmer, kibbutz. 
 

Q: Did you play any role in the Wa r of Independence?  

 

A: Very little, almost none.  I got there very la
te, remember, so I do not claim any, any real 
major role at all.  No.   
 

Q: And then you decided to come  back in 1950?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
38 
 
 
A: In 1950, then, it was part of a homesickness for 
my parents and part of stupidity on my part, 
that I believed that things are the way Communi
st papers describe it in Hungary.  I decided 
to return, perhaps temporarily, perhaps not.  And 
when I arrived in Hungary, I realized that it 
was a fatal mi stake. 
 

Q: Had you found any of that sense of home that you were looking for when . . . 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: when you went to Israel?  

 

A: No, no.  I found my parents, but other than th
at, it was, it was a terrible period for any human 
being, especially people who came from the West
.  It was the worst for those, because you 

were considered unreliable and especially co
mi ng from Israel, even more so.  The reason 
was, that by that time, Stalin was very paranoi
d and Zionism was one of his ma in targets. 

So, it, it, this is, this is something that is not
 much to do with the Holocaust anymore.  It was 
just very hard for anybody to live under Communist 
rule at that time, but especially for Jews. 
We ll, I don™t know if you know that in 1953 when he was dying, he 
looked up and he saw 
some  Jewish doctors around his deathbed and 
he said, ﬁThey are poisoning me, they™re 
against me.ﬂ  And he said, ﬁArrest them.ﬂ  And practically hours before he died, they 

arrested Jewish doctors and I was just at th
e University in Hungary, studying and that was 
my state, the time of my state examination.  
And Hungary had to follow everything that the 
Soviet Union did so they were looking for 
anybody who had anything to do with Zionism. 
And they found me  at the university and I was le
t go, weeks before my state exam.  So, it, it 
was difficult but of course that has nothing to do with the Holocaust anymore.   
 

Q: When you had been in Israel, had you, do you 
feel, did you feel that you had found some  of 
what you were looking for there?  Wa s your intention to go?  
 

A: Yes and no.  Yes and no. I had some  very deep 
feelings about the country as such and then 
again, I was still a young man, eighteen, and I was al
so influenced by a great deal of these 
revolutionary Marxist ideas.  And there were ma
ny things that were not to my liking, that I 
would have loved to see differently.  And so wh
en I left  Israel, I did not just leave it with 
nostalgia.  I left it because I thought that 
finally, some how, in Hungary, I™m going to find, 
find that utopistic state, that, that is, is ju
stice and equality for everyone.  And, I was just a 
little bit too stupid, to, to think that way, but I 
did.  So it a was a, a double reason to return. 
A, a totally unfounded idealism and homesickness. 
 

Q: What did you do for work when you returned home?  

 

A: I couldn™t work for awhile because I wa
s unreliable, anybody who came from the West, 
especially from Israel.  Finally, with some gr
eat connections, I was hired to sweep and clean 
a garage, a state-owned garage.  And that woul
d have been my future for a long time, had it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
39 
 
not been for a, just a, a very fortunate incide
nt when the Party secretary of my, my company 
was sick and a substitute Party secretary was th
ere.  And I appeared at her offi ce because 
there were big posters, they wanted workers yout
h to go to college because they figure that 
some of the mi ddle class and the former upper cla
ss that sends its sons to college and I asked 
if she can recomme nd me  and she said, ﬁWe
ll, I don™t know you but why don™t you dictate a 
recommendation to my secretary? ﬂ  And so that
 was the big first hurdle that I went through 
because the regular Party secretary would have ne
ver written that letter.  
So, with this, I went 
to a university forum, but the trouble is you 
had to write your autobiography, and the mi nute 
they got to a point of Israel, which you could not
 in those days just stay silent about two 

years of your life, when they found out they sa
id ‚Thanks but no thanks,™ and again a strange 
thing happened.  One of the faculty me mb
ers who was on the committee, cause the 
committee that interviewed people consiste
d of faculty me mber, Communist Youth 
Organization, the Communist Party, the union, vari
ous organizations.  He came after me and 

he said, ﬁHolczer, Holczer,ﬂ he said, ﬁwas your 
father from the suburb of Budapest? ﬂ  I said 
yes.  He said, ﬁWas there a soccer team in which 
he and four or five of 
his brothers played at 
the same time? ﬂ I said yes. He said, ﬁI play
ed with your dad.ﬂ  He said, ﬁCome back in 
September,ﬂ he says ﬁYou were a mi nor when you 
left Hungary.  Let™s s
ee if the mi nister of 
education can exempt you,ﬂ you know?   Am
nesty you, pardon you, whatever.  We ll, 
anyway, I went back in September and nobody knew who I was, nobody, they had no idea, 

go away.  So I looked for him and he went in 
to the Party secretary and he came out and he 
said, and he said, ﬁI am happy to inform you 
that the mi nister of education give you a 
dispensation.  You can enter the university.ﬂ  
And he said, ﬁThis is the last time you and I 
ever talk to each other.ﬂ  He said, ﬁDon™t ev
en greet me .ﬂ  He said, ﬁYou don™t know me .ﬂ 
And that was it.  This is how I got in.  Yeah.   So it was two coincidences, very lucky ones.

Tape 4, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape four, side A of an intervie
w with Robert Holczer.  So you entered university, 
what year was this? 
 

A: 1950.   

 

Q: And you stayed, you studied what?  

 

A: I studied, my ma jor was geography and my mi nor was history.  

 

Q: What were you interested in doing after you gained your degree?  

 

A: I wanted to be a geographer.  I wanted to work for the Geographic Institute of Hungary or 
teach geography.  I love geography.  And, in Hunga
ry, it was a very important subject at that 
time.  But in America, it was no subject at all.  I, when I arrived here, people were just 

looking at me  and they said, ﬁNo, this is, 
unfortunately, we are not teaching geography 
here.ﬂ  It was incorporated into what they called social studies in the high school. 
 

Q: So, after you . . . 

 

A: So, I switched and I ma de, I went back 
to school here in 1959, and switched and had a 
history major, ‚kay.  And I left geography just 
out there, I didn™t touch it anymore, so I got a 
master™s degree in history and my secondary credentials, teaching credentials. 
 

Q: After you graduated from, from collegewhile you were in Hungary, what did you do?  

 

A: Then I taught in a junior high school in th
e suburbs of Budapest, working-class suburb in 
Budapest until 1956, when the Revolution broke out and I left.   
 

Q: Did you play any sort of role in the Revolution?  

 

A: Just a very mi nor one.  In the 19
th
 district of Budapest, I 
was asked to form the New 
Democratic Teachers™ Union.  And I had very
 ambivalent feelings about the revolution 
because I was afraid that the same elements
, the same  kind of elements who came up in 
1944, October 15, eventually will dominate it.  I ju
st did not trust the revolution so I stayed 
away from it.  I understood the anger of the 
people and I sympathized with the, with the 
desire to have a free country, but 
I didn™t trust some of the groups 
that participated in it.  And 
what, what really precipitated my departure is
 that a few days before I left, I saw some  
groups with Arrow Cross armbands, and that did it. 
  I realized that I would never be able to 

live here anymore.  There will be absolu
tely no, no peace for some body who is either a 
human being or, or has a Jewish background or favors a peaceful living, lifestyle. 
 

Q: Had you experienced directly any anti-Semitism?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
41 
 
 
A: All the time.  Hungarians are with the Aust
rians and Poles, probably the three most anti-
Semitic countries in Europe.  I felt much 
less anti-Semitism frankly in Germany in my 
nineteen years that I recently spent there than in Hungary or in Austria. 
 

Q: So you decided to leave Hungary. 

 

A: Yes, I decided to leave Hungary and in 1956, November, I started to walk toward the border 
with a cousin of mi ne who just graduated 
from high school and was always in political 
trouble with the police for his outspoken attitude
, so, he followed, he came with me , and we 
then crossed the border after, I think about six, seven days or so.  And arrived in Austria. 
 

Q: Wa s it difficult to leave, did you need any exit visa or any . . .  

 

A: No, it was totally illegal.  We were walking usually fr om dawn to dusk and whatever the 
conditions were, you know, favorable, we didn™t rea
lly like to walk in broad daylight but of 
course we couldn™t walk in the darkness either
 because we didn™t know the terrain.  We slept 
in, in haylofts, the farmers were quite kind. 
 They felt probably a little bit guilty for not 
participating in the revolution and slowly appr
oached the border this way.  And then before 
the border, it was then a little bit difficult, and 
we had to have, we had connections because a 
third person joined us whose relatives lived in a border town and they helped us to get over. 
 

Q: And then your parents were still living–? 

 

A: Yes.  My parents were still there and I told them defi nitely that this time I want them to 
follow me, eventually, when they can come legally.  Because I didn™t want them to, they 

were by that time, the age when you don™t just
 chase some body across snowfields.  So, we 

arrived in Graz, that was the first Austrian town, and you had all the opportunity to go then 

anywhere in the world.  Every country opened its arms. [dog barking]  Lie down, Gelsey. 
 

Q: So you arrived in, in Graz. 

 

A: And the world was then open to us and I inte
nded to go to Sweden.  I wanted to stay in 
Europe, and I just thought that Sweden woul
d be a good place for me  to, to be.  But my 
cousin got away from me  while we were staying in Salzburg, in, in a 
hotel which was one of 

the gathering points for the Hungarian refugees
, and left a note for me  to come  and follow 
him.  And I promised his mother that I would 
take care of him so I followed him and this is 
how I ended up in the U.S. 
 

Q: You followed him all the way to the U.S.? 

 

A: Yes.  We ll, of course, it was very easy.  A
ll I had to do is go and tell the authorities there, 
the, the ones who were in charge of the H
ungarian refugees that instead of Sweden, I 
changed my mi nd and I want to go to the U.S. 
 Not only that, they already, they already had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
42 
 
some  me ssages from the Red Cross saying that
 if I show up, and the reason I was away, 
because previously he had asked me to go to 
Vienna and arrange for him to stay with his 
relatives in Vienna who were not my relatives, 
but he wanted to go to school there.  He was 
totally intoxicated by the, by the light, western 
lifestyle because he had never been to the 
West.  And by the time I came back to Salzburg, he
 was gone.  So, but he left me ssages.  So 
the Red Cross sent me to St. Louis, Missouri to be reunited with him. 
 

Q: Did you have any idea why he would have done such a thing, of just leaving?  

 

A: No, he, he was just, he was a very unpredic
table fellow, you know?   Y
ou could not really, he 
was, he was a just a restless person and I thi
nk he figured, well, why not, I want to see the 
U.S. and, and his me ssage to me  was, ﬁYou can
 always go to Sweden from the U.S.  You 
will have the money and opportunity, but maybe
 you won™t have the opportunity to go and 
see the U.S. if you live in Sweden.ﬂ  Little, 
little did he know about economic conditions in 
the eighties and nineties that, I think, more Sw
edes can travel much easier and come here 

than we in Sweden.   
 

Q: Why did you prefer to go to Sweden?  

 

A: You know, I am a romantic.  And I just felt th
at I would not want to leave Europe.  Europe, 
to me, was always my home.  I loved the old to
wns, and I always loved clarity and that, the 
Scandinavian purity, maybe, that I have seen
 too ma ny, I had seen too many Scandinavian 
movies, Swedish movies.  But they just appealed
 to me, the lifestyle.  And I liked the fact 
that the social security, that people have in Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden. 

And just a lot of things appealed to me  about Sweden, and I knew that I would be treated 

fairly, so, that was it. 
 

Q: And you had, yet you had enough money to just travel to the U.S. instead and . . . 

 

A: No, I had no money.  We  didn™t need any 
money. [talkover]  No.  Nobody had any money. 
All you did was as a refugee, you appeared at, 
when, when we finally were picked up and 
taken to Graz by the Austrian police, they we
re very well organized there, there, you found 
every religious denomination having a booth, 
who welcomed you.  You could go and say 
that I am a Baptist, I am a Catholic, made 
no difference and then name the country where 
you wanted to go to.  And, and it was very si
mple, you didn™t need any money.  Then, next 
step was each had a place in Austria where th
ey temporarily would house you, even give you 
a little pocket money and there you waited for your 
transportation to go to that country.  And 
that so, I did not really want to be attached to
 any religious organization so I went to a very 
independent one called the Tolstoy Foundation. 
 It was founded by Tolstoy™s daughter and, 
using I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy™s books, and so they are the ones who brought me 

to the U.S.  It was all gratis.  I came over, the American military and the Air Force is the one 

who flew all Hungarian refugees over.  
MATS, Military Air Transportation, the, the 
stewardesses and almost everybody involved with us
 were of, of Hungari
an origin, most of 
them from Cleveland.  Cleveland is the sec
ond largest Hungarian city in the world after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
43 
 
Budapest.  And, and so here, they then, then
 I was handed over to a Jewish organization 
because my cousin came through a Jewish organi
zation.   So in St. Louis they were waiting 
for me .  If you were a Hungarian refugee t
hose days, you had no problem because the world, 
the whole world felt very guilty about not help
ing the Revolution and so
 they did everything 
possible.  I mean I was so embarrassed.  I neve
r, I was never in my life treated this way, I 
thought, you know, I was some  dignitary or some
thing.  They were waiting for me  at the 
airport and I was just–  But first I had to sp
end, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp 
Kilmer in New Jersey which was a screening cam
p for people.  They screened out the sick, 
the U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB
 and some other illnesses, they went to 
Scandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Comm
unist Party members and such.  I don™t know 
what the criteria was, but they looked into your
 background a little bit.  And so this is how I 
ended up in St. Louis.  My cousin stayed w
ith me  for about no more than two months, not 
even that much.  He found some  relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to 
Champagne, the University of Illinois, and he ju
st left.  And we were housed, we were taken 
by an American family who had very good inten
tions but the man was a manic depressive so 
you could never figure out for one second to 
another how he would react to you.  And, 
apparently, his wife felt that maybe taking 
Hungarian refugees in would, would some how 
remedy the problem but it didn™t.  And they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a 

very ideal situation for a newcomer although she 
was very nice to me and I stayed there for a 
few months and then eventually, I me t a profe
ssor of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the 
University of, Wa shington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen, Colorado, a house, and 

he and his family spent every summer there becau
se he was a member of the music festival. 
And when they heard– I hated St. Louis, 
I just couldn™t find anything redeeming about 
that, that city, and when they heard that I 
was very unhappy and all this, they took me to 
Aspen, Colorado and they said, ﬁYou can always work here for a dollar an hour, too.ﬂ  And I 

loved it.  I stayed there for almost three years.
  And most of my friends and connections and 
everything in my American life practically co
me s from that period.  
From my Aspen period, 
people who helped me to get ahead in, in more
 ways than one.  So, I am, I was very lucky 
again to end up there.  Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know. 
 

Q: Were you teaching there?  

 

A: I was, no, from Aspen was a place where I collected my money and, and, you know, saved 
enough.  I wanted to go up to Alaska for one su
mme r.  I went up to Alaska and worked for 
the Forest Service and then came to Fresno, Calif
ornia, which offered me  a loan.  I couldn™t 
get a scholarship because they didn™t know much 
about me.  My papers did not arrive from 
Hungary.  So it was, but at least they offered 
me a National Defense Loan so that helped me 
to start school.  And I stayed in Fresno for tw
o years when I got my teaching credentials and 
my master™s degree in history.  And I, thos
e were, scholastically speaking, they were good 
years.  I had very good instructors and, and good 
friends and sponsors and, I did not regret it. 
And then I ended up in the Bay Area where I want
ed to be.  And me t my wife there.  And I 
was teaching in Marin County.   
 

Q: We re you in touch with your parents throughout this . . . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001

A: Yes.  All the time.  And I, almost every summer I went home to visit, okay?  

 

Q: Were there plans for them to come? 

 

A: Yes.  They, once I got married in ™67, they 
came to visit and they enjoyed it very much and 
then in 1974, when, see I ma rried my wife with 
three children.  They were tiny, their, their 
father abandoned them, he was alcoholic.  And 
so, my wife and I raised them.  And by the 
time, 1974, I get an offer from a friend of mi ne 
in Switzerland to come and help him, he was 
a director of a school in a children™s villa
ge in Switzerland, Pestalozzy, very famous 
children™s village, Pestalozzy Children™s Village.  Do you speak German? 
 

Q: No. 

 

A: No.  Okay.  And so, and I loved the mountains, 
I loved the Alps and I wanted to get back to 
Europe.  And since we had only one child at 
home by that time, and he was willing to come 
so we went over.  We , we re
signed our jobs and we went back and the job fell through. 
Because in the meantime, the Sw
iss had the law, not a law, a plebiscite about not hiring 
foreigners unless they can find a local person fo
r the job.  And after years of advertisement 
for this particular position, they couldn™t fi
nd anybody, a couple came just as we were being 
interviewed.  So it fell through and in 1964, no I mean 1965, before I got married, I came 

over to Europe to teach for the Army, just for 
a year.  I just needed, I was a very confirmed 

bachelor, and I needed a year to think about
 whether I want to marry somebody with three 
small children and here a confirmed bachelor.  So
 I stayed for a year when I decided yes, but 
during the year, I got to know a 
lot of people in the system, in the Department of Defense 
School System.  So now that the job fell through 
and we basically gave up our jobs here in 
the States, I had only one, you know, opportunity he
re, to go over and see if any of our, our, 
any of my former colleagues can be found and if I can get any help to get a job for my wife 

and myself.  And not only that I found some  but
 they were now in very, very high positions 

and they said, no problem.  And bot
h of us, within a year, started to teach.  My wife got a job 
even before me, because it was more difficult for high school teachers than elementary.  So 

she started out and we lived in the Frankfurt area and we stayed for nineteen years. 
 

Q: How did you meet your wife?  

 

A: We, when I left school with my credentials, I wanted to, I had a girlfriend in the Bay Area, 
also from Aspen.  She was a schoolteacher and she wanted me  to get a job there so we can 

be close and we were there.  Now all of a 
sudden, she said, oh, at that time it was very, by 
that time it was very difficult to get a job for a 
teacher, in the early sixties, and the only job 
available, finally, was teaching special ed classes.  And I said, children are children, I don™t 

care.  I had to sign a paper that I would go to school and get a creden
tial.  And the ma n who 
hired me was also a Holocaust survivor so it, it 
really helped.  I told him very honestly why I 
want the job and I said, ﬁIt doesn™t matter w
hy I want the job, I will, I will do a good job, you 
can, you can bet on that.ﬂ  And I hope I did.  S
o, he hired me and this is where I met my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
45 
 
wife.  She was also teaching special ed classes, and but she stayed 
only for a few years and 
then when I came back in 1965, then I went in
to special ed for the county, for Marin County, 
and I stayed for almost ten years, nine years. 
 So that™s how we me t.  And then I switched. 
With the Army, I switched back to teaching political science and, and history. 
 
Q: What was it like living in Germany all those years? 

 

A: Well, it was much more pleasant than I had e
nvisioned, frankly.  I found that there is a very 
large segment of a new German generation that 
is, is absolutely appalled, okay, of the past. 
And I met a lot of intellectuals who had a ve
ry good vision of the past, and not only that, 

they spread the knowledge around.  Naturally, ther
e is an element in, in Germany, that is, 
you know, that is the scum of earth, but frankly, 
they are very much the mi nority.  And I, I 
could live in Germany much easier, probably, th
an I could ever live in Austria, where it 

doesn™t take more than a few mi nutes to hear somebody making an anti-Semitic or fascist 

remark, especially if they have a couple of 
beer.  You know.  So, th
ere is, there is a new 
Germany.  Now, with East Germany joining, it is
 a problem.  But West Germany itself, was, 
I would say, a pretty civilized state.  Okay, now 
the East Germans, that™s a different, that™s a, 
that™s a tragedy right now, that they had not 
been instructed by the proper history teachers, 
and, there are big problems in East Germany b
ecause the East Germans said, ﬁThe Nazis, oh 
no, they live in West Germany.  We, we are 
good Communists here, we don™t have to worry 
about the past.ﬂ  And this attitude then led 
to what is happening nowadays in Germany with 
the skinheads. 
 

Q: Was it difficult at first for you to accept that 
Germany was so, that you could really get along 
with some of these Germans? 
 

A: We ll, again, you know, I followed my father.  
He came to see us in Germany once and while 
he was there, our landlady™s son was killed in
 a motorcycle accident, a young seventeen year 
old, a young ma n.  And we had to go to the funeral.
  And my wife said to my father as she 
look around, ﬁGrandpa, look, all these me n of your 
age.  Do you sometimes think of all the 
ghosts that are around here behind these men? ﬂ And my father said, ﬁYou can™t live with 

hate.ﬂ  He says, ﬁThere are ghosts everywhere
.  There are Indian ghosts in America, too. 
You have your own ghosts.ﬂ  And that™s just th
e way that, you can™t constantly think of that. 
And we befriended Germans who were a lot more 
even liberal than, than we are.  And so, I 
mean, you can find all kinds of people.  That, 
but there, Germany, I don™t really worry too 
much about Germany as much as I worry 
about Russia and, and Poland and Austria and 
there you can find a lot of fascist elements and Hungary too, probably. 
 

Q: We ™ve got a few more mi nutes. 
 So, is there anything, what made you decide to return to the 
States? 
 

A: Oh, when, the, the military was in a, is, is
 a drawdown situation where they were pulling out 
quite a few troops from Germany and we reache
d, my wife reached the point where she just 

said she wanted to be close to the children.  
We have four grandchildren.  She, this house 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
46 
 
which didn™t look like this at that time was a 
small little place, this was one end of the house 
and that was the other end of the house.  A 
partner of my brother-in-law lived here, a 
veterinarian, but it was a very small place.  It 
was available.  They bought it and he called us 
and my wife said, ﬁLook, I stayed in Europe 
for nineteen years with you, now I would like 
you to stay where I would like to 
be and it is so nice to be so close to family.ﬂ  Our son is 
only four hours away, in Nashville, with a little
 baby.  And oh, and she gets along with her 
sister very well and we all get along, we neve
r had an argument.  So, that was an ideal 
situation so that™s how we got here.

Tape 5, Side A 
 
Q: I'm Arwen Donahue and I'm here with Robe
rt Holczer in Paris, Kentucky on April 29, 1996. 
This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview.  And first to– ask you a 

couple of questions about the issues that came up in
 the last interview.  I just wanted to get 
your aunt's name , for one thing, the aunt whose apartment you stayed in on Zichy Jeno 

Street, what was her name?  
 

A: Her name  was Aranka, that is Goldie in 
English, you know, Aranka, and Teply, T-E-P-L-Y. 
She's still living in Hungary at this date 
and probably it would be very difficult to 
communicate with her because she is number one
, old, and number two, I think that she has 
some mental problems that she developed since 
the war and, but she certainly is the heroine 
of the whole story and my surviv
al, so I try to keep up with her but it's very, very difficult 
and I'm very, very sorry about that.  But she 
has a son who lives in Switzerland so at this 
point she's still alive. 
 

Q: I didn't quite understand how just go back a 
little bit, when you lived in the house on Zichy 
Jeno Street, before it became a clinic, it was a Jewish house. 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And yet there were some  people who lived in the house who were non-Jews. 

 

A: Non-Jews,yes. 

 

Q: And I suppose your aunt was considered one of them. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: But before the house was designated a clinic
, if anyone in the house were to be liquida– 
were to be put into the ghetto, would they ha
ve gone apartment by apartment, or would they 
have taken the entire house?  
 

A: They would have gone apartment by apartmen
t and, of course, if you could prove that you 
are a gentile, and that was very easy because ev
ery concierge had a list, years ago this was a 
law in Hungary, that every concierge had a lis
t and that had nothing to do with Jews or non-
Jews way back, because when you change your 
residence in Europe, you have to go to the 
police and report it.  In other words, every Eur
opean country, they know who is at that point 
where.  And so this list existed, all they had to
 do, come and talk to the concierge and all the 
concierges were basically serving the government
, they were in my estimate, what I call the 
common man, and their attitude changed regard
ing of what the governme nt was doing and 
they were lackeys and so there was no big pr
oblem, they always could tell who were the 
gentiles and who were not by just showing the lis
t.  But there were gentiles still living in the 
Jewish houses who had a nice place and they ju
st didn't want to move, you know?   And so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
48 
 
when, for example, at one time we were lined
 up because the house was discovered and this 
George Ara Jereczian was not there with his 
guards.  I think they went to buy, get some 
rations for the house, and so we were really w
ithout any defense, and we were lined up, then 
the gentiles who are not down there be also 
lined up because they, apparently they had 
known what was going on and could identify themselves.  
 
Q: But you were lined up although you lived with your aunt?  

 

A: We  were, yes, we were lined up, we were lin
ed up.  And then in the last moment, a lot of 
things happened.  This aunt of mi ne, for exam
ple, she was also out, most people who could 
go on the street were always 
out looking for some thing to eat and bring home and when she 
saw her mother, for example, in the lineup, she ju
st went up to her and started to kick her and 
said, ﬁThis stupid slut.  Just, she is so st
upid.  Every time people say line up, she lines up, 
she's not Jewish.ﬂ  And all this, and in front 
of those Arrow Cross people, she just dragged 

her mother out of the line up and she had a pe
rsonality that nobody argued with her.  So they 
assume that she is a gentile, therefore her moth
er is a gentile, too.  And then we were saved 
because George Ara Jereczian came home and 
immediately, his men immediately went to 
these punks and said, you know, ﬁCl
ear out of here in short order, papers and everything 
else.  And if you want, you know, we'll call the 
Ministry of Defense.ﬂ  And so, they knew 
their job and threatened these people who then left. 
 

Q: You mentioned that there were about ten people living in that apartment with your aunt?  

 

A: About ten, yeah, yeah. 

 

Q: And some  of them were her brothers and sisters?  

 

A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my
 mother, then my father's three sisters, okay? 
Among them this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually 
my father's two brothers, too, joined us. 
They were also under some  kind of a disguise 
as policemen or this and that in whatever 
uniform they could get, but when things were 
really tough the last, I think, ten days or two 
weeks, they joined us, so they were there, 
too.  Then there were some  husbands, my, one of 
my aunts had a husband and a boyfriend.  It was a triangle that the family just tolerated 

because the boyfriend was a much nicer pe
rson than the husband, everybody, so there was 

even humor then.  And some  children.  So we 
mi ght, it's possible we were even more than 
ten and that was very fortunate, a lot of apartments have a lot more than just ten people 

because this was, it sound like, it seemed like a 
safe haven and of course, all the relatives 
were comi ng and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous 

doctors were there who then went on and came 
to this country and elsewhere and the whole 
family was there, so.  
 

Q: What about her other brothers and sisters, 
other than those who were in the apartment?  
Where did they– were they at the time? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
49 
 
A: Oh, my aunt's other, well, we were all toge
ther in the same apartment, it was her apartment 
and because ordinarily a gentile would not have
 had anything to do with Jews, but this was 
an extraordinary place because we, she knew that 
if they really stormed the house, the Arrow 
Cross people, and if they really eliminate 
George Ara Jereczian and his guards, then 
everything is lost, it doesn't  make any differen
ce, so... and inside the house, of course, there 
was absolutely no other rule except you ma de up your own so nobody cared.  Yes?  
 
Q: But she had, there were thirteen all together, siblings, right?  

 

A: Yeah,right. 

 

Q: So... 

 

A: No, no, no, no, thirteen, my father had thirteen 
brothers and sisters and some of them were 
already dead and others were elsewhere.  On
e was in what was Slovakia at that time and 
participated in the Slovak uprising against 
the Germans and was hanged, was captured and 
hanged.  My father was in Yugoslavia, so ther
e were, another was in a labor camp, we didn't 

even know where he was, so th
ey were dispersed.  The women were together, the women we 
could get together and, but the me n, only two of them.  So there were altogether five, five of 

the thirteen, right there. 
 

Q: Also, what was the name  of the psyc
hiatrist, the famous psychiatrist who... 
 

A: Völgyessi, Völgyessi.  He was the most famous 
Hungarian psychiatrist of his, of that time. 
 

Q: Would you spell his name, please?  

 

A: V-O, and there is a double, what the Germans call, what is it, well, anyway, two dots. 

 

Q: Umlaut. 

 

A: Umlaut, yes, two dots on the 
O, then L-G-Y-E-S-S-I, Völgyessi.  And he, he was a very 
infl uential man and I, if I remember correctly, I 
heard, at that time as a child, that he was the 
main reason that this whole setup was the way 
it was.  That he had the connection, he knew 

George Ara Jereczian and he is the one who brought him in and suggested that let's do this. 
 

Q: Do you know what became of him after the war?  

 

A: He was in his, I would say, late 50's in
 1945, but he had a son and two daughters and a 
relatively younger wife, so I assume that they are somewhere and I also assume that they are 

not in Hungary, that they are probably in the 
U.S., so if ever ther
e is a reunion, I will see 
them.  As a matter of fact, I would like to see th
em because I was deeply in love with one of 
the, the little Völgyessi girls.  I was a young kid then, it was just a puppy love. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
50 
 
Q: Who else of the group that was with you in 
the apartment on Zichy Jeno Street survived?  
You and your aunts and your mother?  
 
A: Well, in 1945, we all survived, okay?   But, oh you mean since?   Who's still alive? 

 

Q: So everyone went through okay, went through the war?  

 

A: Oh, we went through the same  experien
ce and nobody... in that house, the only people who 
were taken away were a ma n between eighteen 
and, I think it was eighteen and forty-five or 

eighteen and fifty-five, before, before Octobe
r 15th when the labor, when they truly were 
just going to a labor camp, labor organizations, 
that is when all the men, so there were no 
men until October 15th, between eighteen and fifty-five in that house, they were all taken 

away.  So, some  of the fa milies who lived there,
 for example, their father was not with them 
by that time.  And, I don't know 
of anybody who survived.  In other words, unfortunately, 
most of these people were then in a forced ma
rch toward Germany at the end of the war and 
some where in, probably western Hungary, they we
re just either killed or died of typhus. 
 

Q: Did you keep in touch with anyone else from the clinic after the war, other than your family?  

 

A: No, no, no.  You know, I was fifteen when the 
war ended, and I regret this very much, but 
outside my family, my family is the only one
, and there are only two members living in my 

family and they are the only ones.  I tried to ask them if they can make some contact, I am 

now really very much interested in keeping up 
with some other people, but they, they just, 
they never really bothered and they are not
 very good letter writers so, and if I go to 
Hungary, maybe I will look for it, 
I would like to and I'm going to ask, perhaps, if I can get 
to the, to any, perhaps to the synagogue in Hunga
ry, if they have some  knowledge of, is there 
a group that still comes together, because there 
were kids of my age and I'd like to know 
what happened to them. 
 

Q: When you returned to your apartment, you described, in our last interview, about returning 
to your apartment after the war and finding th
at there were other people who were living 
there. 
 

A :  M mm- h mm.  

 

Q: Were your things, were you furniture, any of your belongings still in the apartment? 

 

A: Yeah, interestingly, well, there was very little 
left in our apartment, what was left, a couple 
of boxes, and I don't know why they were left ther
e, this family never touched.  And that, to 
me, was immediately, I give them some good poi
nts for that.  But when I opened it, our 
apartment got a direct hit when the siege of 
Budapest took place and so a lot of the... and 
most of these boxes contained tablecloth or sheet
s or something like that, and so they all had 

big holes in them.  And, however, a very beau
tiful embroidered tablecloth and the napkins 
we had for a long time until they disintegrated.  My wife mended them and we used them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
51 
 
And now, what happened to the furniture?   A lo
t we give to neighbors to say, ﬁIf we come  
back, okay, hopefully, you will give it back to us 
and if we are not, then it is yours,ﬂ so, and 
they took it and now not one of them had a piece le
ft that they can give back to us. They all 
said the same thing: the Russians took it.  No
w, this was the most illogical, stupid thing to 
say, because the Russian soldiers had two hands
, what are they going to
 do with a piano? 
What are they going to do with a table, what 
do they need it?   The Russians only went for 
one thing.  Watches.  They had watches up to thei
r ears, it's as if they had never seen watches 
before, that was the only thing.  They stop you 
on the street and that was the only question, 
ﬁ
Davay chasi
!ﬂ That means, ﬁGive me  your watch.ﬂ  No
thing else, I mean what can a, a foot 
soldier who is going on and on and on across Eur
ope, what is he going to do with anything 
that takes up space and has weight?   And so
 it was ridiculous, but nothing, absolutely 
nothing was returned from the neighbors. 
 

Q: Did any of your friends from before the war return afterwards?  

 

A: Any of my friends?   We ll, as I me ntioned befo
re, my class, junior high class, was practically 
totally taken and deported under those very unusua
l circumstances, so I had to look for the 
kids who were not my schoolmates, but, or eith
er lower or higher classes, and also the ones 
that I used to play with when I went to the c
ity park which was not far away from us.  And I 
would say that about half of them I found, 
but the other half perished, you know, either 
because of the fires, you know there was bombs
, or because they were killed during the 
Arrow Cross era, after October 15th. 
 

Q: You, in our last interview, had talked a little
 bit about meeting up with some  of your friends 
around Budapest and that you would talk about 
the war and that was exclusively what you 
would talk about.  When you me t up with them 
again after the war, what did you talk about 
then? 
 

A: Well, when I met my fr iends after the war, 
number one, we were so full of hatred, we were 
looking for some  kind of an outlet, some  organi
zation that we can join, and we found it.  And 
part of it was they give away shirts, we found 
a Communist Party.  Imagine, we were fifteen 
year olds and we saw that pe
ople were walking around in red, flaming red shirts.  And we 
found out that the flaming red shirts come  from
 parachutes and these parachutes were supply 
parachutes that were dropped by the Soviet fo
rces and the Hungarians got the material and 
the Communist Party made a kind of a campai
gn and made it into shirts and would give 
them to anybody who signed up.  And I think this 
drew us a lot more than anything else, the 
four very close friends of mi ne, whom I 
knew from the illegal boy scout organization and, 
luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the Communist Party and I think this 

is the first, or almost the last time, I ever we
nt to the Party because, now we went to a couple 
of meetings and we were just bored to deat
h, this happened to American communists, too. 

Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered 

ourself truly Communist Party members becaus
e we were, I think, me mbers for a month and 
then we never paid any fees or we didn't do a
nything after that, but this was, our first step 
was to go down to the Communist Party h
eadquarters and sign up with the Communist 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
52 
 
Party, which was understandable because we felt 
that the Communist Party was going to be 
the one that revenges all these atrocities a
nd whatever happened, and then we saw that 
almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross m
ovement is also in the Communist Party 
because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were 
written about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist inŠon 

the other side.  So we found that and that 
was disgusting, absolutely.  And the Communist 
Party knew about it and they defended it and we 
didn't like that, their terminology, and so we 
quit.  So then we went back to, and kind of
 regrouped as old boy scouts.  But our heart was 
not in it because now, I mean for so many 
years we could not do 
anything as boy scouts 
except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't ev
en wear a kerchief.  And so now we could 
wear a uniform and some  of us really bought 
a uniform, and then we just, we just lost 
completely our lust for boy scout life and th
at didn't work.  Then, you know, this was, 
another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the 

Zionists.  They just, there were a lot of things 
that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am 
going to have a homeland, finall
y, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure. 
Immediately, they send me up in the mountains 
and I had to go through a certain instruction, 
more than one, on more than one occasion.  And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and 

good at learning things, and I became a youth leader
 in the movement and I loved to be with 

young people.  And so that, to me , was a, wa
s a very happy period of
 my life.  My only 
conflict was with my parents.  Since I was an
 only child, of course, they wanted me  around 
as much as possible, and I reached that re
bellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, 
but rebellious enough to move out of the house at
 sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home 
where first I was just a, a resident and I lik
ed being with my peer group.  There were ma ny, 

there were many in Hungary, a lo
t of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this 
as a lifestyle.  And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, 

in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish hist
ory, to prepare us when we go to Israel. 
And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for 

them and once the rebellious period ended, in a
bout a half a year or so, I moved back home 
and one of the reasons was that
 life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, 
anti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now 
everything was fr ee, I mean, and I was a little bit 
of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow
 up very quickly to become a man, and I did 
not like the fact that here were girls of my ag
e who wanted to sleep with me and all this and 
that, I just, I always pictured myself more of 
a, an individual, a ma n who has things to do and 
I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time wit
h, with sex and all this and my mi nd was not 
only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and 

the whole, and because of this, they considered
 me a little bit of an 
eccentric so that happy, I 
moved back home to satisfy my parents, but 
I didn't stay there long enough because I got an 

offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a re
sident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans. 
That was on, it was called Tarogato Street in 
the Buda section of Budapest where I found a 
ma n who became a very good friend of mi ne, th
e man who led the institution, a marvelous 
ma n, also a Zionist, by the name  of Spitzer
4
 and his family, and they were very good to me  
and I felt very much at home, plus I got a ni
ce salary and all my needs were taken care of

there.  Even I had a girlfriend who was also a 
resident counselor there, so happy, really, they 
were very happy days.  And in the meantime, I 
also participated very actively in, I changed 
organizations and left, I was in a, I would 
say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I 
went over to the Marxists because that suite
d my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with 
them and eventually they were the ones that help
ed me to then immi grate to Israel, that was 
after, but we'll get to this.  Now I want to ta
lk just a little bit about school because all these 
times I went to school, too.  Right after the,
 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother 
was determined that I should go to the 
School of Comme rce, the high schools were 
specialized, and there was one that was calle
d, the Special High School for Comme rce.  Can 
you stop it for a second because I want to close 
the window.  So as I said, my mother was 
determined that I should go there, of course
, I had no desire but 
I was still a good boy and I 
started at that school and the fact that it wa
s the mi ddle of the year, basically, and I mi ssed 
the first half of a year wasn't  a big pr
oblem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust 
survivor at that time can just about do a
nything.  So this was no big problem, the big 
problem came when I noticed how ma ny of my
 teachers are outright anti-American, anti-
Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed thei
r attitude and there were some other Jewish 
kids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate 

this, if they think this is correct and ever
ybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I 
said, ﬁNo, I am not going to do that.ﬂ  There 
was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, 
had a German name , a very small ma n who not
 only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and 
anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitati
ng.  He was not just ma king statements, he 
was really agitating and in a very emotional wa
y and I was, I just, I 
reached a point where I 
just couldn't take it anymore, not after what
 happened, just, you know, in the last few years 
and my boy scout commander, and at that tim
e I was still kind of hanging on with the boy 
scout moveme nt, my boy scout comma nder was now a me mber of the new Hungarian Secret 

Police and he was an officer and he escaped 
from the labor camp and went over to the 
Russians and all this and came back with th
e Russian troops already and was one of the 
organizers.  And I went to see him and I 
said, ﬁThis ma n should be removed from the 
school.ﬂ  And they did take him in and some
how they went down the list at school and found 
out that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly 

arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. . .

Tape 5, Side B 
 
Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. 

 

A: I just had to quit.  And then I continued 
my studies, I did not want to have the same 
experience again and I went to the Jewish, the 
Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was 
a school to educate future teachers, but it was 
a high school still.  Just like my previous high 
school was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a 

teaching high school, which meant by the laws
 of Hungary at that time that once you 

finishedŠand it was instead of four, five cla
sses, so you were nineteen when you finished 
the schoolŠyou were then an elementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any 

college education.  I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad 

experience, I didn't have any.  Now I was among 
my own people, there were some  very, very 
good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing 
special, it was not challenging me, the only 
aspect most of us didn't like is the religious as
pect, which we didn't take very seriously.  So 
actually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go 

back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school. 

But out of deference to what happened and all 
this, I got a diploma. 
 So I had a high school 
diploma which, of course, my parents got late
r because I needed one and– so these are the 
two schools.  Once I reached this level of the,
 this, the Jewish teaching high school for, high 
school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps 

Lyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that
, then as far as my experiences after the 
Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvi
ous.  Now, going back, of course in the 

meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go 

practically underground.  As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948 

the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about
, which happened in every Eastern European 
country, and the Year of the Turn is an 
expression when the communists took control, 
complete power, because until 1948, we had demo
cracy in Eastern Europe, those countries 
that knew what democracy was.  And Hungary ha
d some very able politicians and was really 
on its road to become a democracy, so was 
Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of 
course, Roma nia was very different.  But,
 in 1948, everything has changed, we became, 
again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an 

illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company 

found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperia
lists as they called it.  So we were doing, 
basically, the same things that we were doing 
before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and 
meetings were held usually either in some
 far away synagogues, baseme nts or in some 
Jewish orphanages where it was not very obvious 
if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in 
and out because there were hundreds of people 
living there anyway.  The, many times we 
paraded as young communists, if we wanted to
 have a larger meeting somewhere, singing 
communist songs when some body came by, but 
otherwise doing our own business.  By 
1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerabl
e and, basically, they wanted to have the 
whole Zionist movement leave, not the communist
s, but the Zionist movement wanted to get 
as many people out as possible, fearing that
 if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also 
completely communist, that there will be no wa
y from Hungary to go anywhere.  By that

time we could only go illegally across the border.  And I think it was in February, 1949, that 
I got an order fr om my Zionist leadership to
 go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my 
mother come s fr om that town and they knew it. 
 My job was to go to the ma yor of the town 
and ask him if he would like to
 have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on 
some given date.  I went there, I mentioned 
to the ma yor that I had been to Vacz many, many 
times because my grandparents, cousins, aunts,
 I had a lot of relatives and my mother was 
born here, and of course, he was overwhelmed th
at a high school orchestra is comi ng to play. 
I then went to a printer, this was one of my 
instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed 
advertising the date and the concert.  Went back, reported it and the next command was that 

on a certain day, I would have to
 go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a 
corner of Budapest and there would be a bus
 there, a state bus, by that time every bus 
company was nationalized, and I have to board th
e bus with a lot of other people and I have 
to pretend that I am a member of a high school
 band, whatever instrument I am playing, and 
do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel
, anything like that.  And just wait for further 
instructions there.  And of course, I was notifie
d that this is it, that we would be going to 
Israel and I bid farewell to my family and 
got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a 
certain date and time and I saw all my fellow 
Zionist members, the ones who were in my 
group, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border. 
 

Q: Can I ask a few questions before we go on?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how
 you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism 
appealed to you as far as the type of Zioni
st organization that you were involved in and 
hearing a little bit more about how you felt about
 the politics of the time and the communist 
takeover. 
 

A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot 
of those Jews who did 
not come  from the upper 
mi ddle class or upper class.  I came from defi
nitely no better than the mi ddle of the mi ddle 
class or rather, perhaps, the lower mi ddle class.  My father came from a very low class 

proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary.  My mother came  

from a little petit bourgeois family from the northern Hungarian town.  They thought they 

were mi ddle class, but it depends
 on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were 
kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind 
who, it's very difficult to define them, but 
there was not much work and a lot of complain
ing.  Now, because I never had a very, let's 
say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I 
had some sympathies with, with the Marxist 
movement, it's obvious.  Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they 

were the most adamant about taking the war crim
inals and punish them.  They were the most 
anti-fascist and all these things appealed to 
me .  I was, you can consider even though I was 
not a member, really after my one month expe
rience, I was not a member, at least I didn't 

consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a 

lot of their goals, even though I was in a comp
letely different game by that time, knowing I 
would go to Israel.  But, this is probably 
why I changed my affiliation and went fr om a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
56 
 
bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zi
onist organization where I felt very much at 
home.  And there were, of course, ugly things
 happening, the communist takeover in Eastern 
Europe was not a very pleasant occasion.  And 
one only had to think a little bit clearly and 
rise above all this emotion to see that the co
mmunists used very nasty methods to eliminate 
anyone who disagreed with them.  And the more
 power they grabbed, the more vicious they 
became.  And of course, eventually I, th
e Zionists suffered more what anybody who was 
considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father
, who could have been executed if they 
discovered that he was with Tito, so if you we
re an enemy for one reason or another, there 
was no law.  The communists created their own 
laws, the secret police had free hand and, of 
course, I began to become very disappointed in
 that.  My father, he was always a Social 
Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary. 

And he was very courageous because when
 the Communist Party gobbled up the Social 
Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and sa
id, ﬁExcuse me , but I don't want to join you.ﬂ 
Which was very courageous because from ther
e on, you could have been watched.  The fact 
that he comes fr om a working class and was a very
 little fi sh, I think saved his life.  But if he 

had been a name , probably he would have been 
killed then.  And so, politics, yes, I kept my 
eye on politics all the time and this helped me 
in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will 
never be peace here, there will never be peace here.  And, do you have any other questions? 
 

Q :  M mm- h mm.  

 

A:  Okay. 

 

Q: As far as, you had me ntioned that there were
 some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your 
school and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some  of 

that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitis
m was not going to be as much of a problem 
any more?  
 

A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age 
of fifteen, for some  reas
on, I thought that a better 
world is comi ng.  And I was deeply disappointed
 when I heard that there were even pogroms 
in the countryside where a few Jews dared to come
 back to a village or a town in Hungary, in 
Poland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were th
e only ones who acted in a very civilized way, 
but then they were always civilized and th
e most civilized in Eastern Europe.  That 

disappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a 

pogrom in Hungary and in some  other Eastern Eu
ropean countries, two years after the war. 
And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated.  
 

Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents?  

 

A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic
 incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I 
avoided any kind of such thing.  I associated 
ma inly with my own kind because I saw that 

there is no hope.  Now, this interestingly must
 have changed to a certain extent because 
almost every one of my cousins is married to 
a gentile in Hungary, I th
ink with the exception 
of ma ybe two, but every one of them, and the ma
rriages are very solid.  So I, and it's not, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
57 
 
they are still not what you would call a truly mi
ddle class family, that most of them still 
stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this a
nd that, that part.  Now, the ones who are up 
there, went to college and became dentists and t
hose, they are all married to other Jews.  It's 
a very interesting phenomenon.  But I have not experienced anything except when, right 

after the war at school.  Okay?   I heard pe
ople constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans, 
especially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't  expect anything else any more.   
 

Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist orga
nization, did you have, did you really have 
dreams of being in Israel, or that this, that
 this was something that you felt very strongly 

about?  
 

A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a,
 a, just a ma rvelous high of my youth.  The 
whole, the Zionists did a, a 
fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really 
giving us what we wanted to have.  We  had a re
latively free life, we had, we had a picture of 
a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be
 still serving in the army in Israel or just 
working in a kibbutz as farmers, almost ev
erything about it had a kind of a super human 
touch that I'm going to be better than a
ll these people around here who are running around 
like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to 
lead a very healthy life, and fi nally I'm going 
to have a country, I have a home, I will have
 a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous 
feeling.  And also, the whole, the whole se
tup, the whole organization, you know, until then, 
until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we sa
w of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into 
Auschwitz.  And all of a sudden these people co
me from Israel, they are beautiful looking 
people.  And not only that, they had courage, th
e way they carried themselves and they were 
teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them 
Schliahs
, people 
that, those who are sent, I think, literally.  And th
ey were in charge of all these camps where 
we had to go to where we were taught self-d
efense and, you know, we lived on a tree in one 
camp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we we
re given a piece of rope
 and a knife and we 
had to stay up, and sleep up there and ma ke
 our bed and all this.  I mean, which young 
person doesn't  like this?   The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mi nd and we said, 

ﬁGod, it's beautiful.ﬂ  And when we were in da
nger, they were the ones who led us out of 
danger.  I remember once I was up in the Börz
söny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense 
camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and 

there was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it 
was deeper than ma ybe twenty inches, and 
guess who is the one who escaped from the creek
 in order to do something, not to save his 
own skin, but he was imme diately telephoning and 
all this and that and eventually we were 
released.  The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't
 call them, the diplomat is not the right word 
because you picture some body, you know, with a tie a
nd suit and all this, but they were just, 

I, messengers or whatever, leaders.  And he 
escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in 
twenty inch of water, you know, getting on some thi
ng that blend in with the, with the rocks, 
I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable 
people.  And wome n, you know, it's, it's, okay, 
after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew.  I mean, and 

when I took my wife to Israel, she understood th
at, that there was just something about those 
kids.  And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them. 

And they were, they were not really dema gogue
s, I reme mber quite a few of them who got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
58 
 
quite introverted, they were not giving you 
big speeches or something, but by personal 
example, they were leaders because we followe
d them.  So the, the bus going back to my 
escape from Hungary, the bus eventually r
eached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop 
there.  Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we 

stop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside
 pub where they also served food.  We went 
in and we were given money and we could 
order something, and in that pub, there was a 
very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know 
how many skirts on her, this was the reason 
you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they
 still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's 
an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts 
is no big deal.  And she 
started to flirt with 

the bus driver.  And soon the bus driver came,
 went over to her table, and they had a good 
time and, of course, we were getting more and more
 anxious that this is going to create a big 
problem here, right?   We  knew that we were on 
a timetable.  All of a 
sudden, the bus driver 
said to our leader, ﬁHow long do you think we will be here? ﬂ  And our leader said, ﬁWell, all 

these kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five mi nut
es.ﬂ  He said, ﬁGood, I'll be back.ﬂ and left 

with the woman.  We ate, and our leader sai
d, ﬁOkay, line up outside.ﬂ  And instead of going 
back to the bus, he led us down on a field into
 a big barn, I would say about one mile down 
in a muddy field, it was February and snow and 
mud everywhere.  We all got into the barn, 
about thirty of us, they closed the doors, 
barn doors, and he said, ﬁOkay, don't worry. 
Everything will be okay.ﬂ  After mi dnight, 1:00 
or so, the barn door opened and we were, 
they said we have to get on line and marc
hed down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, 
and that was the border between Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia.  The Austrian border was 
already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zioni
st groups come  over, it was kind of an 
arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of m
oney, however, they didn't know which border, 
Czech border guard was a communist or not, so 
we have to be very careful.  And once we 
went beyond the border guards, everything was organi
zed there, I will go back to this.  So as 

we were ma rching down, I saw a woma n in a l
eather jacket with a revolver hanging on her 
hip in blue jeans.  I looked at this woma n's fa
ce, said, ﬁHey, I have seen her before.ﬂ  And I 
looked and said, ﬁThis is the woma n in the pub.ﬂ
  This is to show you how organized they 
were.  I mean, the Germans couldn't have done be
tter, really, with their devilish organization. 
I mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it 
aliyah
, the going of, to Israel. 
If you understood that, how they did it, you can
 understand how they could survive.  All 
right?   Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies. 
 Once we got down to the river, we had to 
take our shoes off, and we kept everythi
ng on our head, the rive
r was not high enough, we 
couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very 
small, and it got to my throat at one time. 
Now this is February, imagine.  We got over to
 the other side and it was supposed to be that 
the border guards change, everything was accord
ing to the clock, and some thing happened 
and the border guards did not change the way th
ey were supposed to, they were still talking 
to each other.  There was snow on the ground 
and the dogs, their dogs were barking, so we 
had to lie down on the snow for 
about a half an hour, wet.  And ma ny of us got sick, right 
there.  I myself, I lost, I got fr ostbitten and even
 today I suffer for that.  Now, then the border 
guards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, 

it was a grape growing region, but had no roof 
and the wind was blowing and I reme mber, I 
don't think I have ever been colder in my life since then.  And so we huddled together 

because now we mi ssed the truck that was s
upposed to pick us up right down on a highway 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
59 
 
beyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us, 
they went down and eventually, in
 about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck 
came back, the truck was looking for us and then 
left and then, anyway the truck came  back, 
we got up on the truck, the canvas, the top wa
s taken down, and from there on, all we heard 
was the engine of the truck wa
s occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the 
word dollar came back all the time, I remember that.

Tape 6, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview w
ith Robert Holczer.  So you'll say something about 
the group of people that you were with. 
 

A: I, my best friend in that group was a young ma
n by the name  of Zev Rotics.  He lives in 
Israel at this time still, in 
Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have 
been ever since, ever since that time, and ev
entually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we 
kept up and I consider him my best friend.  He
's about the only person I keep up with.  Oh 
no, there was one, another, a ma n by the name  of
 Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in 
touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost 
touch with him, so I have no idea what 
happened, I just know that he's living there. 
 But the others, the, I remember one young lady 
who was with us and she, unfortunately, had 
eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna, 
which I will go back to when I continue the st
ory of the journey, and died in Vienna of 
pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in
 the cemetery and I always planned to go 
and visit her, but I always run out of tim
e and I don't know where she is buried, probably 
there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out 

because my wife– Zev Rotics, some times he goes 
to the meetings of our old friends and so 
he would know.  Now, after the truck finally st
opped in Bratislava.  In Bratislava they took 
us to the gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue, 

they took us to the synagogue that had alrea
dy warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets, 
good food, everything, and we were told that 
next morning we are going on.  And it was 
very strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was 

a big show, of course, all just in case some  Sovi
et authority is watching. 
 And they took us to 
the railroad station where we were taken in 
boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few 
people in boxcars, and the train started and I th
ink within an hour or so, they opened up and 
we were in the American sector of Vienna.  B
ecause Bratislava is very close to Vienna.  We 
stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an American hospital, that's 

where the Joint some how got an American hosp
ital for the Zionist members and we were all 
there and we were given good food and warm r
ooms and it was very pleasant, the only thing 
we were always warned about, not
 to ever wander into the Soviet section.  We were free to 

wander around, the city was still divided into f
our sections, American, British, French and 
Soviet.  And some times we had to go very 
close to the Soviet section in going to, I 
reme mber going to a swimmi ng pool, it was on 
the edge, and so everybody was nervous. 

But, basically, it was a good time.  Vienna was fu
ll of refugees, full of life.  After one week 
or so, then we were taken across, again by truc
ks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct 
myself, to, not to Austria, 
to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee 
Association or something, so the joint gave 
us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were 
housed in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town 
called Zaalfelden.  It is a, on a lake, just the 
other side from Germany, and there were so
me very picturesque villages nearby, and I 
reme mber even though here the food was very m
eager and we still were hiking almost every 
day and going up in the mountains, and I reme mb
er that just above our camp, our refugee 
camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it 

and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just di
dn't give us enough energy, but we were still

61 
 
pushing for it, we wanted to see it.  We stay
ed here, again, one or two weeks and then on, 
again, now over the border to Italy.  In Ital
y, they took us again to the train station, 
somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then
 was closed up and sealed, but regular train, 
we just could not leave the train, Italian det
ectives were on the train to make sure that 
nobody escapes because it was ridiculous because 
who wants to escape to Italy, at least at 
that time?   And we were taken down to Bari.  
Now, the only thing that stands out in my mi nd 
was that a lot of times when the train st
opped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and 
the good looking girls among us ended up with do
zens of pictures from Italian men, written 
on it, I love you, I'm going to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the 

girls were exchanging pictures and who wanted 
this one and this one?   I mean it was a funny 
thing to see that those men were really just inst
antly falling in love with these girls.  In Bari, 
a ship was waiting for us, if you could call it 
a ship.  It was called the Galil, Galilea or 
Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the 
ship and in two days or three days, it must 
have been three I think, we were going to r
each Haifa.  Everybody got sea sick, the boat was 

an old, old fishing boat that the Israeli gove
rnme nt brought from, bought from Greece and it 
was a primitive thing, very primitive.  And I know
 I have a very strong will and I don't want 
to, you know, go back to that, to the story, 
but I never throw up, some how I just psych 
myself up ever since I was a little kid as a resu
lt of an incident that I would not throw up. 
And I remember I was the only one on the sh
ip who could eat. Everybody else was just 
constantly throwing up and so we arrived, by 
the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was 
just yellow and green and wouldn™t want to l
ook at food.  Now, the funny thing about this 
ship is that a few years ago I was travelling 
in France with my wife and we stopped in the 
Loire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as
 we were walking in the town there was a 
kind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it 
was very inexpensive and I needed a summer 
suit for wearing on some occasion that I have to
 wear a suit and I went into the shop and I 
was trying on the suit when the owner of the 
shop all of a sudden yelled and said, ﬁShalom 
haver.ﬂ  And it appears he was talking to 
my wife and somehow it came that he was a 
Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife
 that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this, 
because he had a definite Arabic name .  And so
 my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish, 
too you know, and this, so he invited us af
ter the dealŠwhich was a good oneŠhe invited 
us to a bar down on the street, an outdoor café, 
to drink some thing with him.  And during the 
conversation he asked me a little bit about my 
life and he said to, and I asked him and he 
said, ﬁOh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor.ﬂ  I 
said, ﬁWhere did you sail? ﬂ  He said, In the 
Mediterranean, of course,ﬂ and I said, ﬁWhat sh
ip?ﬂ  He said, ﬁThe Galilea.ﬂ  ﬁWhat time?ﬂ 
He said, ﬁFrom 1948 to 1950 some thing.ﬂ  We ll,
 he was on that ship, you know, and I mean 
it was a small ship and he was one of the sailors. 
 We ll, when we arrived in Haifa, of course, 
that was a very emotional scene and then even
tually, the war, basically, was finished and 
there was no temporary animosity so then we, 
our movement went to a kibbutz there where 
we then blended in and one year after we we
re taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our 
own land then.  I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing. 
 

Q: Everyone from your group then who was trav
elling together went to the same kibbutz? 
 

A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz ex
cept the ones who did not want to go to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
62 
 
kibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment 
to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed
 to stay together, but this was not the 
case.  There were, not everybody wants to live 
in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult 
living for those who dream of money and wealth 
and their own car and all this because it's a, 
at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great 

deal that you owned at all, you  know, you were
 lucky if you had a radio that you can call 
your own.  So we lost, I would say, about one
-third of our group w
ho had planned, but not 
shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside. 
 

Q: How was it decided that your group would 
go to a kibbutz, was it decided communally 
among the group or did someone else decide it for you?  
 

A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, w
ith very little exception, very few exceptions, 
were geared toward the kibbutz.  This was 
an understanding back in Eastern Europe where 
we were recruited that Israel, and they always
 brought the example of the pyramid, that the, 
we Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we
 had all the, the farmers, and down at the 
bottom where the pyramid is the largest, we ha
d all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a 
pyramid upside down, where the largest group is 
going to be the farmers and the agricultural 
group, and the smallest one is going to be the inte
llectuals, the tip of the pyramid.  So almost 
every Zionist organization, that was the very 
strong influence and educational goal to teach 
you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know?    So that was the reason why most of us 

did go to a kibbutz.  And who decided it?   It 
was decided above, that had nothing to do with 
us, where we would go, we were assigned to 
an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large 
kibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which 
is in, about mi dway between Haifa and Tel 

Aviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year. 
 

Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all?  

 

A: We  did not speak any Hebrew when we arrive
d there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, 
except the ones who came fr om very religious fa
milies.  They knew quite a bit and for them 
it was much easier to learn, we spoke no 
Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, 
Hungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak
 Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit 

kind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids.  There were so many 

Hungarians comi ng in at that time that the Hunga
rians even had a nickname in Israel, they 
were called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the 

street and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because
 they heard us speak.  And so we were in 

a big hurry to learn Hebrew.  And then when 
we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the 
Hungarian language is such that your accen
t stays with you no matter what language you 
learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even
 when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had 
our difficulties with the language, but most of us 
learned it eventually.  I was there in Israel 
for two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently. 
 

Q: What trade did you learn on this kibbutz?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
63 
 
A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbut
z and worked out plowing everything connected 
with the tractor, it was called a Falha, that 
particular branch, and from sacking, you know, 
flours and up to plowing and th
en seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything.  Then 
we got our own land, own piece of land, whic
h was a reclaimed area on the train line 
between Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the,
 the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so 
Jordan give back a piece of land so the train 
service can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because 
part of the train line was in Jordan.  This wa
s the land that we received, and it was a very 
dangerous place, so when we, the first day we 
went out there, I remember, was really hair 
raising because the tractor drivers had to go dow
n and plow and the, the weed in Israel is 
much higher than a human being and also we di
dn't know where the mi nes, if there were any 
mi nes.  And even though the army supported us
 and they did give us, you know, generous 
support there, we the tractor drivers had to go 
down and practically open up the area.  And so 
we were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason.  Above us was an Arab town, Tul 

Karem, which today is under Israeli occupation 
and still a very hot spot for riots.  And I 
remember that Arab town practically you coul
d see the people on the street, and here we 
were on the other side living, you know, two enemie
s and of course, I had a lot of adventures 
because of living on the border, but then again, 
that has not much to do with the Holocaust 
and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a 
lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't 
need.  I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result 

of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know. 
 

Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds 
of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in 
that area. 
 

A: We ll, when we first showed up, when we fi
rst showed up, the first day, there were Arab 
shepherds down on the other side of the barbed
 wire, the border was just marked with a 
bunch of barbed wire.  And when they saw 
us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and 
they were running away, they were just scared
 to death.  These were shepherds, very poor 
people, and we didn't know exactly who they we
re, but we learned eventually, that they 
were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land for very 

little.  And eventually, we also saw that here on 
this side of the border we are plowing with 
up-to-date 20
th
-century machinery and we saw not 
far from us, a ma n on a horseback 
whipping people just because they did somethi
ng apparently that did not please them.  The 

owner of the land had practically complete ju
risdiction over these poor fellows, and that was 
just a few hundred yards from wh
ere we were working.  As they got used to us, they came 
closer and closer and when they saw that 
we don't mean any harm, they came down to the 
barbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make 

friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was 

very expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, 
and we already had quite a few children in our 

group, babies.  Cigarettes were very expensive fo
r some reason in Jordan and they were very 

cheap in Israel, American cigarettes.  So th
ey asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but 
they did not want to do it during the day because 
they were afraid that the– Jordan had the 
best military force, the Arab Legion, trained by the British and they were afraid that they 

were patrolling there and all this and it was a seri
ous crime to deal with, 
with Israelis.  So at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
64 
 
night in the darkness, and I remember it was 
my turn, too, it was always a few people and 
always the tractor drivers because we had the 
contact with the border people, we went down 
because they would recognize us and it was a very
 risky thing, they could have just shot me 
dead right there, it could have been a tra
p.  We  went down and we were doing all the 
business, they jumped over or we went over, 
but mainly they came over because they were 
much better fence jumpers than we were.  So 
this was one contact that we had.  The other 
one was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry rive
r beds, that run across, they don't recognize 
borders, they run, you know, back and forth, Israel
, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which 
is most of the time, this is where the Arab 
thieves come over, they use these river beds 
because you can't  see them, they are, you know, 
they are like little canyons.  And they would 
come over in these river beds and go into othe
r areas and steal, mainly animals.  And they 
were unbelievably good thieves.  They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they 

would steal a donkey, they would steal a hor
se surrounded by walls.  Nobody could ever 
fi gure out how they did it.  So 
the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out 
and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis 
and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, 
we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come .  And I only had one occasion 

when three of us were in a patrol and there 
were about fifteen or twenty of these comi ng by 
and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them
 because what chances do we have?  And so 
we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't 

want to engage in any fire fight there.  
Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian 
Legion, which then eventually had also a sad 
ending.  All of a sudden one day we were, I 
was plowing I reme mber, and I had to have alwa
ys a guard on my tractor with a submachine 

gun who was constantly casing and watching becau
se I was so close to the border and this 

was a friend of mi ne one day who was a guard 
in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp, 
guarding Arabs during the Wa r of Independence, 
so he learned some  Arabic from them. 
And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some , an Arab Legion 

patrol right by the barbed wire and they were
 motioning to us to come  down and we said no, 

you know.  And so they went away.  Next day they came and again they were motioning, 

they said, ﬁPeace, peace.ﬂ  So finally they went 
back about fifty yards and they put their guns 
into a pile and then came back, showing that
 they had no weapons and they told us, ﬁSit 
down on that side of the border.  What can we 
do? ﬂ  They were about twelve, if they really 
wanted to kill us, we said, ﬁOkay, let's go down.  
What do they want?ﬂ  They just wanted to 
talk to us and from there on, every day th
ey would come down at a certain time and 
eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all 
over, so it was like a party, they would yell at 
one of these poor fellows who was working there a
nd I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it 
is, ﬁHey, bring me a watermelon.ﬂ  
Yalla Jibbu Battiyah
.  And they brought a watermelon 
and they would slice it and we were eating, 
almost every day we had a little lunch there 
together, we brought some  stuff.  And this
 went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and 
weeks.  And eventually we really fooled 
our countries because sometimes they came over 
and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel a
nd some times we jumped over and we said, ﬁOh, 
we ate in Jordan.ﬂ  And one day it was our tu
rn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come 
down yet so we were waiting for them, but we 
were already sitting on the other side, we had 
a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from 
our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is 
there, but it is a totally different patrol.  
What happened, apparently some body saw them and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
65 
 
reported them, I don't know what ever happene
d, I never saw them again and these guys 
were, they drew their guns and they are going 
to shoot us.  And you know that border was no 
joke, every night somebody was killed there, eith
er an Israeli or an Arab.  Very innocent 
people, you know, some times a, one night I 
felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, were 
walking around and apparently they were in 
the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most 
of the Israeli border guards were from Arab c
ountries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds 
kind of strange, but Jews from 
Arab countries, and they were vicious.  I mean, you could not 
get better border guards and they were, they hate
d the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. 
And so they were, they were, they saw one 
at night, they were shooting sometimes for no 
reason.  So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and 

the fact that my friend spoke some  Arabic and 
all this and mitigated the situation, but then 
the ma n said, ﬁHow come  you speak some  Arabic?   Where did you learn it? ﬂ  And then he 

had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was 
leading all them, always a master sergeant 
leading the patrol, he said, ﬁYou have one luck th
at I have a son of your 
age.ﬂ  He said, ﬁIf I 
ever see you even down touching the barbed wire
,ﬂ he said, ﬁI am going to just make dust 
out of you.ﬂ  And of course, we never went
 back again.  That was, these are some 

experiences living on the border. 
 

Q: Do you reme mber what you would talk about w
ith these, with the guards before they were 
taken away?  
 

A: Well, it was a very simple conversation b
ecause we had a language problem, it was mainly 
sign language quite a bit, and we were talki
ng about, basically, these people were talking 
about their children, they showed pictures
 of their families and the word peace, 
Salaam
 or 
Shalom
 in Hebrew, was constantly me ntioned.  And 
I have a feeling that all of us involved, 
probably, if they are, hopefully they are alive,
 will always remember this and that kind of 
softened us up, so we know that human beings
 can relax under certain circumstances and we 
don't have to be enemies.  It was the first tim
e that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't  
necessarily have to be my opponent, you know?  
 

Q: How ma ny people were me mbers of this kibbutz?  

 

A: About a hundred, about a hundred, and all 
from Hungary.  But other kibbutzim had 
sometimes mi xed.

Tape 6, Side B 
 
Q: Okay, this is tape two, side B of an inte
rview with Robert Holczer.  Did you find that your 
dream of Israel was fulfilled, the utopian ideal 
that you had and some  of your, your thirst for 
a place where you felt you belonged, was fulfilled there? 
 

A: At first I was very, very idealistic.  Then
 somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in 
our kibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to 
kind of tear us apart.  And there were more 
and more arguments and some how this and the f
act that as the country settled down into so-

called peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms
 that every nation in the world experiences, 
surfaced, such as crime and– but the fact that th
ere were Jewish criminals, that shocked me. 
You know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't  want 

to do anything to hurt another human being.  There were even, even murderers, and I just 

one day after another, these things, they a
dded to my little disappointment, but I was still 
enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors 
and we, we did the physical work and it was 
all that a young person wants for self-image, good 
self-ima ge, we had a very good self-ima ge 
of ourselves.  There were two things that c
ontributed to my, to my comi ng, going back to 
Hungary eventually in '51.  One was, all of a s
udden I realized that I, in all my life I loved 
my father very, very much, and this is a, I 
mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about 
it, I loved my father more than I loved my
 mother.  Some how I always considered my 
mother a little bit of a, of a 
kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood. 
And I thought that she was a little bit, she was ju
st in another, in other words, she wanted 
me  to be also, you know, like she was, and play 
the piano and all these things and I was not 
the type.  So I was not that close to he
r even though I was with her all the time and 
practically, I was also instrumental in saving he
r life in the war when I dragged her with me 
everywhere and all this, but my father, and I r
ealized I spent very little time with my father 
as a young ma n because he was always away i
n, in the concentration camp.  And now he 
was home and now they couldn't come  any more, 
Hungary was sealed.  And then I also, at 
the age of nineteen, became somehow involved 
with a group of cynical people.  And I met 

them here and there and some  of them I knew from Hungary and they were ma rried to this 

and this, I just some how was under the influen
ce of these who saw nothing nice any more in 
Israel except the bad things.  This, the homesickne
ss plus the fact that then I began to get all 
kinds of propaganda ma terial from Hungary 
and some how, this was the third thing, I was 
mi sled by all this, what I read, and I thought that
 the situation changed and Hungary is such a 
marvelous country today.  And my parents tr
ied to communicate to me, even though they 
never wanted me  to really go away, but now they
 didn't want me to really come home, they 
were afraid what would happen to me .  And th
at, they just apparently didn't come across 
quite well because I, eventually I just decide
d I want to go back to Hungary, and probably 
homesickness had a great deal to do, I, at th
at time as a young man, I didn't realize that you 
can't  go home again, you know?   I envisioned that ev
erything is going to be back and all this. 
Well, I then applied to the Hungarian Emba
ssy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, 

didn™t keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to
 Hungary.  And those were the worst years, 

aside from October 15th, those years were the wo
rst years of my life, the next two or three 
years.

Q: Before we go into more details about that
, you me ntioned that you found the Israelis very 
well organized as you were escaping from Hunga
ry.  When you arrived in the kibbutz, did 
you, did you share the feeling that the way that
 the kibbutz was organized was, was very 
good and smooth and, did you have any observations about that?  
 

A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, th
is was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock 
work.  Also, there was a hierarchy which na
turally some people didn't understand, but I had 
no argument with that because I realized a pe
rson who came here fifty years ago when there 
was nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting 
at them, has, is more equal, right, than 

somebody who arrives here today.  It was well 
run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very 
good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are comi ng, good ones, 

entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of
 let down in this respect.  No, I admi red the 
way they carried on.  Just a little, just a little 
thing that shows that how they thought of 
everything: shoveling manure, for example, of
 course, not some thing that some body wants 
to do for the rest of his or her life, so or wa
shing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there 
were certain things in the kibbutz that it 
was not a, an area where you were assigned 
permanently, they were temporary.  And so 
everybody knew that once in a month I have to 
shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, 
I have to wash the dishes, so, there were 
some  other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human ma nner.  
 

Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exac
tly you would be doing when you went back to 
Hungary, was that– was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed?  
 

A: I was naively thinking about going to the uni
versity and continuing with my education to 
become a teacher, a high school teacher, and so
 I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey, 
Black Sea, Roma nia and then Hungary.  
Travelling through Roma nia by train, in 1949, 
excuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the 
people just looked at 
me , looked at me  and 
since there are quite a few Hungarians in Roma ni
a, I then– eventually they found out that I 
speak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively 

give all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at 

me, just looked at me, just looked at me, a
nd also Romania was tremendously gray and I 
could only think of 
1984
, going across Roma nia.  And 
that was only the beginning, 1951, 
you know?  
 
Q: You're referring to the book, 
1984
? 
 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: You're referring to the book?  

 
A: Yes, I refer to the book 
1984
, or the movie rather, okay?   It's
 the same thing, but the movie is 
the one that I always keep in my mi nd when I think of Romania.  So I arrived on the 
Hungarian border and here was an officer on the 
border looked at my papers and all this and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
68 
 
he, I'll never forget what he told me, he sa
id to me , ﬁI don't know where you come  from, but 
it must have been very bad, very bad there, th
at you come  from.ﬂ  And he looked at me  and 
said, ﬁWelcome  to Hungary.ﬂ  And this was a 
border guard officer.  And I thought this is a 
strange thing, what does it mean?   Well, I lear
ned very quickly.  When I boarded the train 
again on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as comi ng through Romania and then 
finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I r
ealized that I was totally, totally mi sled. 
Never have I been mi sled before or after th
e way I was.  I arrived there and it was the 
grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, 
paranoid society you can imagine.  And my bad 
period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to 

the university, of course, was ridiculous to thi
nk about because I was an unreliable element, I 
came home, number one, from the We st, I was an 
imperialist agent, as far as they were 
concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent.  And it took me almost six month 

to get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors a
nd clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a 
state-owned garage. 
 

Q: How did you get the job?  

 

A: With great connections, the fact that my fa
ther was from the working class and ma ny of his 
brothers and their friends were involved, but ma
inly their friends of where they come  from, 
this suburb of Hungary, a very poor one, s
uburb of Budapest, where now the communist 
officials with great connec
tions, but nobody wanted any name s, nobody wanted to stick out 
their neck, they just some how pushed some  pa
perwork some where and I was an, kind of an 
auxiliary labor help, a no name person whom 
they hired because they needed somebody to 

clean something.  And that was the only job I could get.  What hurt me even more was the 

fact that my good friends on the street, some 
of them who stayed in Hungary, not too ma ny 
because most of them escaped, but they woul
d not want anything to do with me  because 
most people didn't want to touch me , didn't wa
nt to talk to me, they don't know me, they 
rather would go to the other side 
of the street than to meet me.  Some probably out of disgust 
that how stupid a human being can be to come  back to this, and others for fear.   
 

Q: Because you had been in Israel?  

 

A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't  ha
ve to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it 
was a totally paranoid society, everything that 
happened in the Soviet Union was copied the 
next day, you know.  So the, I worked in this
 garage for about six month and I always 
noticed with great nostalgia, how they have 
these posters about urging workers to go to 
college and I wanted to go to college, and I went
 to the Party secretary of the firm which had 
about twelve garages, had to sign a paper th
at recommends you to go to the next step and 
every time I went to see him, he laughed at 
me , he said, ﬁYou know that you are here by the 
grace of a few people and not, you have no me rits 
to go there.ﬂ  So the, my break came when 
the secretary became very ill, the Party secretar
y of the firm, and they sent out a temporary 

Party secretary, and she was a woma n, she wa
s very busy when I entered, you know, dirty 

and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and 

try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she 
said, ﬁWell, I don't have time to write you a

recommendation.  I'm glad that a worker want
s to go to college, we need working youth, 
why don't you dictate what you need to my secret
ary and I will just sign it.ﬂ  So I passed the 
fi rst hurdle, with this I went to the univers
ity where I had to submit this.  This was a 

committee, they interviewed you and they r
ead your, you had to write your, your biography, 
autobiography for everything, ev
erything.  So here was a committee, admitting committee, 
the Young Communist League, the Communist Part
y, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, 
I would say, seven, eight people.  And when they
 got to certain points, they said, ﬁCome on, 
you must be joking that you really think that
, you know, you can come  here.ﬂ  We ll, I left 
and as I was going out a ma n whose name  was 
Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was 
the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the 
university where I wanted to go, it was called 
the Teachers Academy, but it was 
part of the university.  He came out and he said, ﬁHolczer, 
Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer
 team? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ  He said, ﬁDidn't 
your father have four or five brothers play
ing on the same soccer team? ﬂ  And he said, 
ﬁYes.ﬂ  And he said, ﬁOkay, come  back in
 September and see, maybe since you were a 
mi nor when you left the country, I will try and 
write to the Ministry of Education, maybe 
something can be done.ﬂ  Well, I was holding my
 breath for three months, I went back in 
September and I went into the Party secretary'
s office, they had no idea who I was, they 
couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was l
ooking for him.  And I found him and he said, 
ﬁJust a second.ﬂ  He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few mi nutes later and he 

said, ﬁI am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Educati
on, on the basis that you 

were a mi nor when you left Hungary, give you sp
ecial permission to enter the university.ﬂ 
And he said, ﬁNow, this was the last time you 
ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you 
ever even thought that we have anything to do 
with each other.  Never again.ﬂ  He said, 
ﬁThat is the price.  You understand? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ Said, ﬁand say hello to your dad.ﬂ  That 

was it.  I went home, my father reme mbered him, they played on the same  team.  And he was 

the head of the physical education branch of 
the faculty, you know?   And 
this is how I got in. 
And I had a very, very good time because I 
found out ninety-nine percent of the kids 
thought the same way as I did and there were 
very few communists, very few.  And yet, 

when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown
 out for about one week.  Stalin was dying 
and when he, in his last breath, he looke
d up, he saw doctors around him and he was 
paranoia, he said, ﬁWho are these?ﬂ  They said, 
ﬁDoctors.ﬂ  And Stalin was very anti-Semitic 
and he said, ﬁAre they Jewish doctors? ﬂ   And 
I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight 
were Jewish, they said, ﬁYes.ﬂ  They said, ﬁA
rrest them.ﬂ  And they were, all the doctors 
around Stalin were arrested a few days before 
he died.  And then, when this happened, in 
Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doc
tors or anybody who was, had anything to do 
with Zionists because they called them the Zioni
st conspiracy against Stalin and they found 
me at the college.  They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down.  So they 

found me  and they told me  to go home and that 
I am a Zionist this and Zionist that.  And 
Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams 

and all this and it was in March and I was r
eady to take my exams soon and then when 
everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw
, this is what they called it politically, the 
Thaw started, then they called me back and 
they said forget about the whole thing and 
continue.

Q: You me ntioned in the last tape that your fa
ther had, after he returned from Bor, he was 
appointed on a committee for housing? 
 
A :  M mm- h mm.  

 

Q: What, what happened with his work, with hi
s career, did he remain on that committee after 
the communist takeover, or did he continue, you 
also mentioned that he went back to work 
for his former employer, did he continue to work
 for this former employer?  What became of 
his career? 
 

A: My father's former employers, either died 
or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the We st, so this, 
what I me ntioned, was a volunteer work.  
Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do 
something.  This was volunteer work, he volunteered
 to be appointed to this position and this 

was not a paid job.  And it did 
not require a great deal of his time.  He immediately looked 
for some opportunity and started to work for a co
-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops 
were are a group of people who banded together
 and formed a what you would call a, ma ybe 
a small enterprise, as long as they worked 
under the ruse of a cooperation and everything 
was divided, the profit if there was any, and they 
paid their taxes to the state, this was what 
the communists considered kind of a happy in-betwe
en of state farms or state enterprise and 

private enterprise.  Because private enterprise 
was phased out gradually, except in cases such 
as a shoe ma ker that, you know, repairs shoes, but
 even for that, eventually, they had co-ops, 
shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but 
a few, a few of those branches, that you could 
not really work any other way except in a co
-op, but he was working for a co-op where he 
rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he
 rose to be kind of a mi dlevel manager, but 

also working and this co-op was working w
ith a lot of wome n w
ho would then get the 
merchandise and do it at home.  They were
 ma king shopping nets and shopping bags and 
things like that that anybody can do on a sewing 
machine at home.  And then they would 
bring it in and so actually they had a very, a ve
ry small area, a very small base and just a 
warehouse and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it a
nd he was very much liked.  The only problem 
he had occasionally is that they asked him,
 because he was such a good worker, and he 
received all kinds of awards that he didn't rea
lly want particularly because he was not very, 
you know, infatuated with the communist system, 
they always wanted him to join the Party 
because he was a perfect, what they called cadre
, cadre, he come s from the working class, he 
was a hard-working ma n, he was an honest ma n, he rose from nothing to a mi dlevel 

manager, so he was an ideal person.  But he never joined, he always said, ﬁNo, absolutely 

no.ﬂ  So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone. 
 

Q: Did your mother have to start working?  

 

A: No, my mother was totally just a mother a
nd a housewife, she never had any, any, and I can't  
remember my mother having, you know, political
 opinion or anything like that, she had 

other interests.  She read a lot and went to
 the movies and she loved visiting around during 
the day, she was kind of a social butterfly.

Q: You me ntioned that in school you 
were studying geography and history?  
 

A: Yes, that was my, in college, geography and history. 

 

Q: And that the other students who were in school
 with you were, were also didn't have a lot of 
sympathy for communism.  Did you all get toge
ther with your classmates and did you, did 
you talk about politics often, what was 
the mood like among your, your, your fellow 
students?  
 

A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics.  You know, eventually, throughout 
these years, we isolated the ones who were susp
icious to us and– because they were always 
eager beaver Party workers and give big speeches
 and some  of them did big speeches and we 
knew that we can still talk to them, they™re just
 careerists and they just want to go ahead. 
But I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things. 

Obviously, we didn't do it on the street, we di
dn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or 
in a restaurant where there was a lot of noi
se and they couldn't discern, you know, who says 

what.  So in this respect, we did not really 
have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college. 
And our professors, I would say 
eighty percent of them were very much against the regime 
and occasionally they let that go in very, 
you know, ambiguous statements.  We  recognized 
it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to 

Russian instruction every day, most of us either
 didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen, 
we didn't learn anything, and after going through 
college, at the end you had to take a state 
exam.  And I, the exam in H
ungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which 
you had a topic.  And you were gi
ven fifteen mi nutes to take notes on that topic from your 
me mory, you were given a pencil and some  pa
per, and when you were called upon, this was 
your turn and you could talk about, introduce your
 topic and there was a committee.  And I 
went to my Russian exam, and this happened to
 other people too, and I drew my topic and I 
couldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I just, in these years I just never 

bothered to read, to learn enough to read.  T
oday of course, I'm not very proud of this, 
because now I know that the more language
s you speak, you know, the more lives you have, 
but those days, this was a political statement, 
they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't 
believe it because I was straight A in my s
ubjects and so there was tremendous animosity 
toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others.  Can we stop?

Tape 7, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape three, side A of
 an interview with Robert Holczer.  Do you want to continue with 
what you were saying about your. . . 
 

A: Oh, the Russian exam.  And then I found out la
ter that some of my classmates had the same 
problem and, eventually, they deci
ded not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D 
and they were very angry about it.  But in a 
way it was their fault, too, because how could we 
get up to that point, going through all classes, di
dn™t they realize that something is wrong?  
Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, th
at that was one way to show our reaction to 
what was going on.  And otherwise, even the 
ones who were very active in the Communist 
Party, most of them always gave us a signal that
 this is all a show, there is nothing to worry 
about.  There were very few people.  So when 
I left the college, at that time, you, I became a 
teacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could 
not, you could not teach 

in Budapest the fi rst year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far fr om Vacz, 

from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles 
and taught there for a year.  And this was a 
small village of a mi nority, Hungary has very
 few mi norities, but they have some  Slovak 
mi norities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, 

but they would not admit it because they were 
afraid that there would be repercussion, so 
they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they c
ould have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, 
too.  And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the 

Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one.  And then after this year 

that I spent in– I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I 

found interestingly that the Communist Y
outh Organization, the Pioneer organization 
probably could use me  because, I mean I we
nt through the boy scouts, I went through the 
Zionists, I had some very definite ideas and 
I answered an ad and 
became a director of a 
summe r camp.  They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young 

teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was 
just a day camp, and it turned out to be such 
a good experience that the local Communist Party 
secretary asked me if I would like to come 
and teach in the district.  And I said, ﬁNaturally, this is it!ﬂ  And so I was transferred to, just 

to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again. 
 

Q: When did you graduate from college?  

 

A: '53. 

 

Q: And so it was in '54?  

 

A: Yeah, the Revolution came in '56, okay, so. . . 

 

Q: So you taught for two years in a suburb of. . . 

 

A: Yeah, right.  One year in the countryside and two years in this suburb.  Junior high. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
73 
 
Q: You me ntioned that you were involved with th
e Democratic Teacher's Union at one point?    
 

A: During the Revolution, they asked me  to orga
nize a Democratic Teacher's Union.  I was not 
a Party me mber, they knew that 
I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this 
I wanted to bring out and emphasize, that as 
a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an 
anti-communist because you knew one thing, as 
long as the Communist Party was in power, 
there would be no pogroms and your life is sa
fe.  And this is what happened after 
communism, and communist fall, most of my 
relatives and friends who were in Hungary, 
this was their greatest fear, that what will 
happen to them now.  And anti-Semitism is now 
rampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too.  So th
is is just an interlude, I just wanted to say 
something about that.  So I was just teaching in
 this suburb and until the Revolution and as a, 
and during the Revolution, they sent for me  a
nd they wanted me to get the Democratic 
Teachers Union together, various democratic orga
nizations, and all this.  And I came out to a 
couple of briefings with people, with the local
 council, the town council, the district council 
and one day there was some  fighting out ther
e and I saw a bunch of people with armbands, 
the Arrow Cross armbands.  And I looked out 
the window and all my desire to ever do 
anything or to stay there, just went away.  Right
 in that moment.  I realized that this is now 
when I have to leave.  Even though I had a ve
ry good life, the last three years, after I was 
transferred to Budapest, I had a very, ve
ry good life, relatively speaking, you know?   A good 
salary, I started to write for the newspaper,
 the– stories about young people.  I ran camps 
and financially, and I got all the recognition and 
awards and all this, I couldn't complain.  But 
when I saw, when I saw that, the symbol, I we
nt home and I said, ﬁThis is it.  I will never 

return except to visit.ﬂ  And I told my parents, ﬁIn two weeks, I'm leaving.ﬂ   
 

Q: Where did you, you me ntioned that you had a, 
you had a real enthusiasm for working with 
young people and that seems to be something that
 you did for most of your adult life and at 

the time, what, where did your, where did that 
enthusiasm come  from and what, what were 
you teaching, were you teaching them simply ge
ography or were you trying to teach them a 
broader range of things?  
 

A: We ll, when I was transferred to Budapest, 
immediately I started to teach geography, they 
had these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the 

afternoon and depending on their interests, jo
in groups, study groups.  
And I was running the 
geography group which was a lot of introducti
on and simulations of how a river is 
meandering and then old river is meandering, a lo
t of tests, hands-on type of activities.  I 
took them to hike and I taught them how, orient
ation in nature and all, everything that was 
roma ntic in the boy scouts.  And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic 

kids who eventually would follow me  anyw
here, you know, and it appealed to me  as a 
young, and I can still do that, and so then people 
saw this and they hired me  to run big 
camps.  But I always neglected the political thi
ng, that was not, I never really cared for the 
politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing.  
I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement 
and suggested a completely new uniform and embl
ems and all this, what kids love at that 
age, because the Pioneer uniform is the most
, was the most impractical thing a child can 
have.  A white shirt, can you imagine, with da
rk blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
74 
 
nothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have
 any emblem anything, so I said, ﬁNo, a child 
wants to see his or her achievements, right there,
 he or she wants to show it to the world.ﬂ 
And so they were, they were giving me  some
 free hand to do it and 
I did a lot of this, 
submitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I 
loved, that I could have some influence and 
push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one, 
that is, I think that pleased me a  great deal. 
 And eventually, it was a,
 I did it until the very 
last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my 

group as adults.  And when I went back later 
on, ten years or fifteen years later, some  of 
these kids were running the same kind of camps
 and organizations and they always came and 
they said, ﬁYou know, if you had told us that in 
the mi ddle of the night 
we have to leave our 
homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in
 a place, we would have been up there. 
And we would have been following you all the way 
out to the border.ﬂ  I didn't tell them that 
I was leaving because I didn't want them to even 
have this silly idea, but after I left some of 
them learned about it and three of them cam
e after me  and ended up in Switzerland, but 
eventually went back to Hungary.  So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into 

them and I go out and look up some , and those who 
were very nice to me, I always see.  I 

even see the Communist Party secretary, the 
woma n who was influential to get me , I took 
my wife, too, to see her during the late ‚70s and early ‚80s, she and her husband, I just, they 

were good people.  They came from th
e old communist underground, you know?   And 
though we never talked about it, I'm sure they we
re just as disappointed in what happened to 

Marx ideas as most other people.  But they 
would never discuss it because they were too 
loyal to the Party. 
 

Q: When 1956 came and some  of the demonstrati
ons started, were you intrigued in any way or 
did you mainly feel concerned about the fascis
t elements that you were seeing?   Did you go 
to the big demonstration on October 23rd?  
 

A: Yeah.  I was on the street all the time b
ecause I believed that I have this, anybody, most 
Holocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted 

to read the crowd.  The mood of 
the crowd.  And so I was in the street all the time, watching 
what's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent
.  I was like an animal and I knew that I 
knew exactly what was going on.  And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no 

good or quite a few of them could be up to
 no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't  
lose its spots and even though it all started with
 great democratic slogans, eventually after 
two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a 
lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live 
under Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the Russian tanks came back.  I just didn't 

want to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because 

there were ugly incidents.  The Revolution st
arted for two weeks, the fi rst one week was 

kind of democratic and looked like democra
tic and the second week, just everything 
disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more. 
 

Q: You also mentioned that there was an extr
eme amount of anti-Semitism during that time. 
Would you just tell me  some  examples of what was going on?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
75 
 
A: Well, unfortunately, after looking at all the countries where anti-Semitism is so rampant, has 
been and still is, I must conclude that all Cat
holic countries are that way in Eastern Europe, 
only the Catholic countries.  Poland, Hungary, 
Slovakia and Croatia, these are the countries 
where, and some  of them have very little Jews
, in Poland there are only a few thousand Jews 
left.  I have experienced anti-Semitism all th
e time, [coughs] excuse me , and even when I go 
home nowadays to visit, well I have
n't been to Hungary for the last three years, but the letters 
I receive from my relatives constantly refer to that and my family was never very much 
interested in bringing this out because they are,
 rather, they consider themselves Hungarians, 
the ones who are living in Hungary today and I'
m always surprised that this is a main 
concern to them, so apparently this situation has never changed.  In 1919, Hungary became 

the first fascist country of Europe, even before
 Hitler, and stayed that way, at least, even 
today under the current, the undercurrent is very anti-Semitic, the Jews are responsible for 

everything just like in the Middle Ages. 
 

Q: How long did you have to prepare to leave,
 you ma de the decision to leave and then, how 
long did it take before you actually left and how did you ma ke preparations?  
 

A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the firs
t week of November and it took me  about ten to 
fourteen days to get going.  I just wanted 
to say goodbye to my good friends and my family 
and also I had a cousin who wanted to come
 with me and I had to do a little preparation 
there, too, because he was just a high school gr
aduate and a very green fellow at that.  And 
eventually he brought his friend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to 

fourteen days, I can't  remember exactly, but no mo
re than two weeks.  I just wanted to see 
exactly what works, what doesn't  work, how can
 I approach the border, the most practical 
way, a lot of people were practically there and 
then captured and brought back to Budapest. 
And the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go through all this and then in 

the last second, just before you would go ove
r to Austria, captured, you know, be captured, 
so I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and 
tried to think of the practical aspects of how 
to do that.

Q: I™m going to sit next to you, Robert, so we™re not leaning too much. 

 

A: Yeah, yeah. I– basically, I want as little to do with Hungary as possible, and Hungary 
usually come up in my dreams, in a nightmare. 
 

Q: Itdoes?  

 

A: Yes. I... obviously I™m not that devoted to Hungary.  I™m not a person who really believes 
much in national identity, you know, I just... I feel that cause more problems, that and 

religion, than anything else, so I™ve never been a patriot of basically any country, and 

there... I still am not.  So, does it sound all right?  Yeah, an eye on there. All those 

countries, so they wouldn™t turn Fascist.

just basically following up on... on a couple of other interviews we™ve done for the

Q: –go into the chronology, to hear more about your theory of nations. Did... you were 
talking a little earlier, just about how you really have an ambition of going back to 

Hungary and finding the people who are living in the same  house that you were during 

war time. So, do you... but then again, you don™t have a lot of strong feelings for 

Hungary. Do you dislike going back, when you have visited?  Or, how do you feel about 

visiting there, even? 
 

A: Well– 

 

Q: I™ll hold it. 

 

A: Yeah.  I don™t mi nd visiting Hungary, but... and the reason I don™t mi nd visiting, because 
I still have fr iends and some relatives I care to see and I care to be with. But, on the 

whole, when I am there, I feel like a total stranger, which is not... which is not just 

because of what happened to me , it™s also a tremendous generation gap. Most of the 

people of my age, are... [dog barks] probably you have to stop that. 
 

Q: Yeah, I™m wondering what... Hungary– 

 

A: Yes, that I... as I mentioned, I like to be with people, but the feeling of totally estranged, I 
realize is not just what happened... because of what happened to me , but also because I 

am now a... I... reaching the age when most people are just not around any more. And I... 

it™s a strange thing to walk through streets where you used to play, and you know that 

nobody is there any more from your previous life.  However, when I hear some  anti-

Semitic rema rks, which you can hear often in Hungary, even today, or I see some very 

rude behavior, then I realize that I am very lucky not to be here, yeah. So... and I have 

never been a patriot of Hungary. I™ve never had a Hungarian passport in my life. I™ve 

always been really, stamped. Every document I ever had in Hungary, had a big... a ZS on 

it, which meant I was a Jew. So, since I was never a first class citizen, not even a second 

class, no citizen at all, I just don™t have any attachment to the country, as such. I do have 

attachment to certain places where I grew up. 
 

Q: Are you an American citizen? 

 

A: Oh yes, I became an American citizen in 1961, and so I always kid people who ask me , 
when they hear my accent, what happened to me , how come  a foreigner is teaching 

American governme nt?  Some  of my students question me  and I said, ﬁWell, I have been 

an American much longer than you, and your parents.ﬂ And so– 
 

Q: Do you feel more of an attachme nt to being... to America than Hungary in any sense?  I 
mean, by being a citizen, by having lived here for so long?

78 
 
A: Oh, definitely. I must be honest and say that
 I do not have nationalistic feelings, as most 
people would have. The flag or a national anthem doesn™t really mean much to me. I 
don™t consider that patriotism. But I like a lot of things here, especially the constitution, 

and I appreciate the fact that I can live a free life and for them I am very grateful and my 

patriotism ma nifests itself this way, and not by waving the flag. 
 

Q: Did you know anything about the Constituti
on before you came, or how did you learn 
about... about the Constitution?  
 

A: No, I didn™t, because I couldn™t... I couldn™t read it, I didn™t speak English, and in 
Hungary, they were not very eager to translate the American Constitution as I was 

growing up. But when I came here, and I began to learn English and eventually when I 

went back to school, and was a history ma jor, I had to... so, base... my first encounter 

with the Constitution was in college, in Fresno.  
 

Q: And what... what impressed you about it, or what was your response to it when you first 
_______________?  
 

A: Oh I thought that it was a tremendous document, naturally, and I still admi re the people 
who wrote it. I consider them geniuses, creating something from nothing, truly, and I 

wish that we had some  of that caliber walking around today in Wa shington. 
 

Q: Was becomi ng a citizen of the United States an important event for you?   Did it mean 
anything?  
 

A: Yes, because I never in my life held any kind of citizenship or any kind of passport. And 
the fact that now I have something that will... unfortunately, that in the 20
th
 century, the 
fact that you are a human being, with two eyes and a nose and everything else on you, is 

not sufficient proof for you to travel around the world and be protected by international 

law. Considering all this, I felt much safer now that I have a country behind me and I am 

protected in case I am in trouble somewhere. Yes, it meant a great deal, because those 

days, I liked to travel a lot, and it was a sense of security that I had from it. 
 

Q: We ll, going back to then, when you first arrived in the United States, in 1956?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you reme mber your conceptions, your ideas about what the United States was then 
and what you actually found and what your first impressions were?  
 

A: Well, since I came from a Communist country, and before that a Fascist country, initially 
the U.S. was never painted as a paradise. Never even painted as any country that is 

desirable to live in. All I heard about it was negative. However, I was raised in a family, 

my father was a very enlightened ma n, and he raised me  on the truth, so I knew that this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
79 
 
is the country of the free. And I had no qualms about this. The thing that bothered me  a 
great deal about comi ng here, and also I, as I mentioned before, I did not come here... this 

was not my first choice, you know, I had to follow my cousin. What bothered me , I 

have... I was never that much in favor of modern times and fast times, and a landscape 

with skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life. I was a typical European, who 

felt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered houses, and a lot of 

people on the street, and sidewalk cafés, and little restaurants. Then to go to a country 

where none of this would exist. So I had my reservations this way, emotionally. I had no 

qualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a 

place that doesn™t have much traditions. 
 

Q: Did you find that to be true, that your impr
ession was that there was no tradition here, or 
did you– 
 

A: Yes, yes, very much so. I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example 
Christmas. I consider our life here quite plastic and I understand why. I am not faulting 

anyone for it. I know that a country that is so young as the United State, just never had 

the opportunity to develop those traditions that European countries have, that existed now 

for thousands of years. And so... But it is just sad. I feel that a great deal of problems 

come  from the fact that we are so young, and we grew too quickly, almost like a teenager 

who just became totally uncoordinated.  
 

Q: But you mentioned that your father taught you about America, that it was... that it was the 
Land of the Free. What did that mean to you?  What did that mean to him?  
 

A: We ll, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we 
listened to London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure, 

even the Voice of America could be heard. A
nd, of course there, we heard a great deal 
about the western... so-called western world. A
nd realized that while we are living there 
as practical slaves, in the western world, people have a very good life. And that appealed 

to me a great deal. 
 

Q: How long were you in Camp Kilmer, when you first arrived in the U.S., in New Jersey?  
 
A: I think it was no more than two weeks. It was just a screening process to just give a very 
superficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the 

country. They were looking for me mbers of
 the Communist Party and unfortunately, 
people who were sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the 

United States. For example, if you had TB. And then, from there... and also, they were in 

charge of sending you some where. So, they were kind of dispatchers. 
 

Q: So it was then that you got sent to– 

 

A: SaintLouis. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
80 
 
 
Q: SaintLouis. 

 

A: Yeah, Saint Louis, Missouri. 

 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, what did you do there?  

 

A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time, 
adopted, of course, just symbolically, my c
ousin, and we were united. They were a... you 
mi ght say upper-middle class American family with some problems and they thought that 

getting two Hungarian refugees would probably mitigate their circumstances. And I was, 

within weeks, working for a wholesale jewelry company. I was just a stockboy. And, 

very simple work, and that was my job. And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with 

me , of course, we were walking around and 
going to a movie, even though we couldn™t 
understand much of it. But just planning, eventually, to be integrated into this society. 

And on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched television. And the family 

was... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic depressive and we 

could never figure out what his moves would be next. The... his wife was a very darling 

woma n, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian 

refugees, the situation mi ght change. They had a mentally retarded son in an institution, 

who came home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young 

ma n, who was always creating some thing electrical, or mechanical, even. So, we had 

good relationship with him, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only 

when we left for Europe, that was the time when I lost contact and I don™t know where 

she is. I understand they got a divorce after. It was in... unbearable to live with somebody 

who was so unpredictable. 
 

Q: You mean when you left for Europe to move there with Jan and–  

 

A: Mm-hm, mm- hm, yes. 

 

Q: ... much later. Uh-huh. Did you have the idea at that time, that you would be staying in 
the United States?  I know you had the idea originally that you didn™t want to stay, and 

you wanted to go back to Europe. We re you thinking, after you had arrived, that you 

would actually stay?  What... What were your thoughts about the future?  
 

A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, 
even if I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status 

anywhere. The reason was, once you were placed in a country, you couldn™t really do 

much about it any more. So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly 

didn™t want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in 

Saint Louis. Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone. I worked mainly, 

this is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family, 

German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name  a group or a race around the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
81 
 
world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms. 
And then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that time. You were 

either of German descent, or you were Black. And luckily, when I became very, very 

upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, 

as I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me  on weekends to be... 

to go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. And they 

introduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, 

wouldn™t know. I went to just about every ni
ghtclub, I heard just about every jazz band 

that there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis. And many times, in a huge dance 

hall, I was the only white face. And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, 

because of that.  
 

Q: We re you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, 
rather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had 

anything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German 

descent co-workers?  What was the story with that?  
 

A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn™t prevent them from 
being prejudiced against me  too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. It was 

just a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established 

person. And I felt this, everywhere. I just... and the situation at home, where I was 

staying with these people, was also not very happy. And that, I think, contributed to my 

thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other place.  
 

Q: So you came with some  ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise 
you to see how... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country 

and the way that the White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality? 
 

A: Yes, yes, that surprised me  very, very much. In one of these weekend excursions, I was 
introduced to a very charmi ng college student, she was Black, and we started to date. 

And eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her 

life was in danger, and my life was in danger. And she said, ﬁYou don™t understand this 

now, but twenty years from now you will understand. And as much as it hurts me , we 

have to stop seeing each other.ﬂ  And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, 

really, on a personal, you know, basis. 
 

Q: So, up until then, you really hadn™t realized 
what a strong division there was, or what a 
taboo there was against interracial relationships?  
 

A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I 
thought I am comi ng to a society that is much more different and much more positive 

about these things. And it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred, 

that I knew could not be erased very soon.

Q: Were there any civil rights activities going on in Saint Louis during the time that you 
were there?  Wa s there... were there any at– you know, discussions, just in the wake of 
the Brown versus Board of Education deci
sion that interracial education would be 
happening?  I mean, were you aware, or... that
 the schools would stop being segregated?  
Were there any things like that happening in Saint Louis that you were aware of?  
 

A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. So I only lived there for five months or 
so. And I... my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss 

anything political with people. I did watch television, because I felt that it was a good 

way to learn, and I got certain ideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met, 

you know, this kind of a problem in Saint Louis, no. 
 

Q: How did you learn English?  

 

A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when 
you have to, you learn everything. You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you 

learn English. No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. Not so easy to 

write, but to learn, because it™s... the grammar is much simpler than some European 

languages. I just put my mi nd to it, and I decided, if I am here, I mi ght as well do it. I 

could have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted 

to be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that™s the truth. I think 

of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen 

to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned 

just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. And among all the 

people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most 

progress, because I just decided I don™t want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don™t 

want anything to do with this. I really want to learn English.  
 

Q: It was a... you mentioned in the last interview that it was a friendship with... was it a 
professor at Wa shington University?  Wa s that how you got out of Saint Louis and to 

Aspen?  How did your acquaintance with this ma n come  about?  
 

A: He saw a newspaper article about us, in the... I think it was the Saint Louis Post Dispatch. 
He... Because we were the first ones, my cousin and I think the first Hungarian refugees. 

And he cut it out and mi splaced it some where, and only a few month after, some how th-

the article came up and he called us and he invited both of us to dinner, to his house. And 

by that time my cousin was gone, so I went and I met him and his family. He just wanted 

to socialize and talk about the days in Hungary. He came to... he had come to this country 

before I, right after World War II. And his wife was a former German psychiatrist, and 

they had one son. And– 
 

Q: But they were not Jewish, were they, or– 

 

A: Yes,yes– 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
83 
 
 
Q: ... were... they were Jewish?  

 

A: ... they were. And... but of course, this doesn™t have anything to do with it. Interestingly, I 
last... I lost contact with them in... sometimes in the sixties, and reestablished it last year 

when I went to Aspen. And Mrs. Chabay was there. The professor, Mr. Chabay, was 

already dead, but she was there, visiting from Florida, where she lives in a retirement 

home. And so I had a good chat with her about the good old days.  
 

Q: When you me t them, did they ask you about your experiences during the war?  Did you 
talk at all about that?  
 

A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally. But they were also very much 
interested in my... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good. 

Some thing happened to me  after I moved out of my original family, and established my 

independence. For a couple of month, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a 

room, because they needed some  money, and they had a room with a separate entrance, 

so I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad experience, and so I was just ready to leave, 

anywhere, in the United States. And this is when they showed me  a film of Aspen, 

Colorado, where they had the summe r home, and where he was a me mber of the music 

festival staff, and said, ﬁYou are comi ng with us.ﬂ  
 

Q: Do you want to say anything about the experience that you had, that was bad?  

 

A: We ll, it was... I don™t even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it, 
but it was just a strange coincidence that my father™s company™s... every company in 

Hungary had a Party secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what 

was going on. And my father™s Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who 

rented the room. So, he and his wife imme diately, when this came  to the surface, they 

immediately were afraid that I mi ght report on them back to Hungary, which I had no 

interest, I couldn™t care less, except one day they... I heard a big argument and I realized 

that they were arguing about abortion. The 
ma n wanted his wife to abort, she was 

pregnant. They were very... social climbers, real social climbers, who were constantly 

adding up, every penny on a piece of paper, figuring out when and how they can move, 

they can buy more furniture, they can buy this, they... a child was the last on their priority 

list. And so I heard her cry, and all this, and a few days later I came home, and she was in 

a pool of blood. She had done some thing to herself, and I found her, and it–

Tape 8, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape one, side B, of an interview with Robert Holczer. Go ahead. 

 

A: And so the young ma n knew now that I... we have a secret, and he was afraid that I would 
report this back to his mother. And of course, I had absolutely nothing to do with his 

mother. Then, next, the ma il from home stopped. I did not get any, any, any ma il, which 

was very strange, because I had an agreement with my parents that every week we shall 

write to each other. They received letters from me, desperate letters, what happened to 

you?  And nothing. This went on for weeks and weeks, until I went to a Party, and the 

woman confidentially asked me to step aside, and told me that she was with them 

somewhere, and they were a little bit tipsy, and they were saying that they are stopping 

all my mail and stuff it under their mattress. I left the place very quickly, I went home, 

looked under their mattress, and I found all the letters, and confronted them with this, and 

I knew that I would have to move out, and that™s exactly when this happened, that I was 

invited and they said, ﬁOh, you come  with us.ﬂ 
 

Q: So you went to Aspen?  

 

A: Yes. I went to Aspen, and that was like going from a cave to paradise. Not only that it 
was beautiful and now, I had always been a mountain ma n, but the people, I just loved 

the people. That was way before Aspen was discovered and ma de into the rich ma n™s 

Mecca. It was now a... it was a great deal of Europeans... Americans from the 10th 

Mountain Division that exist... that trained there during World War II, and many of its 

me mbers came back and established Aspen. It was just a ma rvelous group of people. 

Today, of course, they are all dead, but their names are on streets, and the recreation 

centers and parks. And it just... it was a little bit weird for me to return and see all my 

friends names as street names and park names and all.   
 

Q: What was it... tell more about what it was about the place that was so appealing to you, 
and also how that changed your perception of the United States, if it did. 
 

A: What appealed to me  is, number one, up on eight thousand feet, you need each other. The 
winters are pretty harsh, and the summers were filled with tourists comi ng to the music 

festival. You needed other people™s help and you had to help others, too. There was just a 

camaraderie there, a very open attitude that appealed to me a great deal. I was still young, 

and the fact that I could get a job where I... my hours were not so regimented, even then... 

there, I felt so free. The pay was good in comparison to other, you know, kinds of other 

areas of the United States.  There was so much color in the place. All kinds of people 

comi ng and going. It was just a... for a newcomer, it was a ma rvelous, ma rvelous 

introduction to American life. There were people there who were truly the most mi ddle 

class, rigid family. There were people whowere a very relaxed family. All kinds, and 

they were all... they all got along so well, that was a great surprise to me. I also loved the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
85 
 
fact that a great deal of the town, the eastern part, was still in such primitive state back 
then, that some mi ner shacks still had cooking utensils on the stove, just as they left them 

back at the turn of the century when the panic came and ma ny of those mi ners went back 

to Italy and you... what is today Yugoslavia. So, there was a little bit of the old. Not 

everything was concrete and glass, and well, even today the town has preserved a few 

buildings. I was very glad to see that not everything is rebuilt.  
 

Q: When you formed friendships with people and ma de contact with people there, did they... 
were they interested in your past, and where you™d come  from and what had happened to 

you during the war?  Did anyone ask you about that, and did you feel compelled to talk 

about it?  
 

A: Yes, yes, they were very much interested.  These were the type of people, the locals and 
well, most people worked in businesses that catered to tourists. And it was an asset if you 

had an accent, and if you look like some body who had an interesting past, because they... 

sometimes they hired me for a certain job just because I had a story. And yes, people 

were constantly questioning you about this, and I couldn™t care less, it... as a matter of 

fact, I enjoyed this kind of fifteen mi nutes in the sun. And so, I mean, in this respect, I 

had no problem. 
 

Q: Did you find that people had an understanding 
of what had happened during the war, and 
the history of what had happened to the Jews in Europe?   
 

A: Mm, mm, well no, not much. The only people with whom I could really communicate 
about the war, and what happened in Europe, were the ones who were in the European 

theater, and as I, as I mentioned before, many of the so-called 10
th
 Mountain Division™s 
members settled there, and I loved to talk to them, because they were very much involved 

in the liberation of some  of the European countries, so they knew where I came from. I 

just have to add one more thing to this, that interestingly, the reason I am so fond of 

Aspen, even today, because I believe that my life in America was shaped by that two and 

a half years I spent in Aspen. Almost every major friendship, almost every major contact 

I had, after I left Aspen, was based on some thing that happened to me  in Aspen. Almost 

every one of them. I still am very close, and my closest fr iends today, I say, in the U.S. 

are those who were with me in Aspen, and those who still are alive.  
 

Q: What was the work that you did while you were in Aspen?  

 

A: When I arrived there, immediately, the next day, I started to wash dishes in a little café 
house called the Epicure. And I was there, I think, for no more than five days or so, when 

a very nice looking Austrian gentlema n stopped by and, who looked, I reme mber, who 

looked exactly like the famous French actor, back then Fernandel, and said to me ... he 

watched me  washing dishes and he said, ﬁOh, I am so and so, I am a friend of Mr. 

Chabay.ﬂ And that was the gentlema n who brought me  to Aspen. He said, ﬁAnd I would 

like you to come  over and see my shop.ﬂ And he brought me  over to his shop, he had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
86 
 
nice jewelry and gift shop, and it was... he was a watchmaker and that was his ma in 
profession, but he also had a very, very nice place. And he asked me ... we conversed in 

German, since he was Austrian and I spoke much better German than English and he 

said, ﬁHow do you like my shop? ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhat a nice, nice, cute place.ﬂ He said, 

ﬁWould you like to work for me ?  I can give you this much,ﬂ which was a lot more than 

washing dishes. I said, ﬁBut how can you hire me ?  I don™t speak English.ﬂ He said, ﬁI 

didn™t ask you whether you speak English or not, I asked you whether you like my shop.ﬂ 

And he said... And I said, ﬁYes,ﬂ and he said, ﬁYou™re hired.ﬂ And that was the kind of 

attitude that prevailed in Aspen. Easy going, fun loving, a lot of kidding. So I worked for 

Kurt Breznits, and I started to work for him, this was in 1957, about, I would say, July. 

And our friendship survived for forty-two years, because he™s the one, he and his wife, in 

their eighties, I visited them last year. Now, I work there until late fall... early fall, excuse 

me . A young ma n came in around September, and by that time there weren™t too ma ny 

people in Aspen, because it™s a seasonal place. At least back then, the off season, you 

could hardly see anybody in the street. At the end of September, people were leaving, the 

music festival was over, and the ski season came around in December. So everybody left, 

vacation, travel. A young man came in and started to talk to me. He said, ﬁI got a 

problem, my mother has a birthday and I have to get something for her.ﬂ I said, ﬁLook, 

that™s not... shouldn™t be a problem.ﬂ In my broken English I said that, and he looked at 

me and he immediately said, ﬁWell, where ar
e you from? ﬂ  And of course, the whole story 
came about and I said, ﬁWell, why is it a problem to buy something for your mother? ﬂ He 

said, ﬁBecause she has everything.ﬂ And this is how I me t a then young ma n by the name  

of Sheldon Rich, who was the son of a Chicago banking family. And on his twenty-first 

birthday he received a nightclub from his pa
rents, called, The Limelite. He just kept 
comi ng back and talking to me, and we just became really... friends. We™d occasionally 

go out at night and he would bring his dateand I would bring a date, and had a very nice 

relationship. And then he came back later on, and he said, ﬁI have to leave my place, and 

there are three apartments in the  nightclub. I just hate to leave the place unattended. 

Would you mi nd moving into one of the apartments?  You can just stay there, and when I 

come  back we can just share apartments, and no problem.ﬂ We ll, who™d... who would 

refuse a fr ee apartment? I moved into the Limelite apartment, and when he came back in 

December to open it that year, he said to me, ﬁLook, I desperately need somebody that I 

can trust, to be the cashier. How would you like to work for me ? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI double your 

salary.ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell, I would do that, but I am very loyal to my boss, whom I love 

dearly and I just... I just can™t leave.ﬂ He said, ﬁOh, this is America. We don™t have to 

worry about that. I™ll take care of that, I™ll talk to him.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou know, Robert, 

here, we don™t even show up when we leave, we just call and say, send my check 

some where.ﬂ He says, ﬁThere™s no loyalty here.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo?  You want me  to be loyal to 

you.ﬂ The conversation went on and on and on and I said, ﬁWell, I just cannot go to my 

friend, Kurt Breznits and say, ‚I am leaving,™ because you double my salary.ﬂ But the 

truth is, I needed money very badly to go back to school. That was my aim, that once I 

ma stered the language, I would go back to school. So, by the... I went to work next day, 

and my boss and friend, Kurt Breznits was laughing and said, ﬁRobert, you don™t have to 

have these problems in this country. This is not Europe, and not only that, I would be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
87 
 
delighted if you can ma ke twice as much money as you ma de here. I can™t afford that 
salary.ﬂ But I said, ﬁBut we were such good 
friends.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, from now on, as 

long as you™re in Aspen, every Friday night, we will have dinner in my family home.ﬂ 

So... and we did that, just every Friday, I usually work late Fridays, so they had an early 

dinner, just so I can come . And we had dinner together and talked a great deal. And we 

saw each other other nights too, but that 
problem was solved, but I could never 

understand this distance that is between employees and employers. I™m still, even in my 

old days, as a high school teacher and all this, I would have been very hesitant to go and 

report to somebody that I found a better place and I want to leave. I know it™s silly, but it 

was just pounded into me  that you are loyal. And so I worked for the Lime lite, which 

became a very well-known nightclub those days, with a lot of folk singers, as that was the 

time when the Kingston Trio and all the others became famous and it was the... you 

know, the great time of folk singing. Pete Seeger and all the rest, the... most of them 

came to this nightclub. And eventually, from cashier, I was promoted and eventually I 

ended up ma naging the place. And then my friend and boss, Sheldon Rich, became lucky, 

because his hated nightclub was sold. He could sell it to a group of folksingers who were 

singing there, three, four people, and they formed a group called ﬁThe Limeliters,ﬂ named 

after the club, became famous, and now they could buy the club from him. So, he sold the 

club, and I became the employee of the group, and... up until 1959, when I left. But I 

maintained relations with one of the group, and his family. These are people who still 

very much around today, you know, the four. And one of them, Glenn Yarbrough, who 

was my friend, is still producing CD™s. 
 

Q: And you decided... so your motivation to leave was really that you wanted to get in... to 
continue your education?  Was that– 
 

A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the 
money to go out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some  

kind of a business, was more and more expensive. As Aspen became more and more 

fashionable, everything became more expensive. Besides, I had no interest in opening a 

business. I always thought of myself as an educator. I wanted to go back to school, and 

luckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska. 

They said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it™s fascinating, and it™s 

beautiful. And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at 

the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try 

to ma ke money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to school in Fresno. 
 

Q: Why Fresno?  Why Fresno?  

 

A: Why Fresno?  Yeah, people always ask me  this question, because I™m the most unlikely 
person to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction. Hundred, 

hundred ten degrees heat. Why Fresno?  Because they were the only ones, back those 

days, who answered my letters... not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble 

getting my records together from Hungary. It was against the law, at that time, to send 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
88 
 
anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with 
some body. And so, I just... a college had to accept me  on my word, and apparently they 

were afraid to do that. But Fresno said okay, you can come , spend a seme ster, we™ll find 

out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. And we 

cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense 

Scholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. And so I 

applied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. That™s 

what it was called back then. And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I 

ended... I ended up in Fresno. And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece 

of America that was very unknown to me . A
nd it was a little bit of a crazy town, with... 
Fresno is the center of the Arme nian population in America. And they were... I hit it off 

with them extremely well, no problem, until they found out that I am writing my master 

thesis on Turko-American relations in 1918-1920, and that was the time when the 

Armenians were persecuted terribly. And of course, no nation is all bad, no nation is all 

good. And of course, when they were reading a little bit of my thesis, they found out that 

I was very sympathetic to Kema l Ataturk. Of course, I condemned the me thod of getting 

rid of Arme nians, but I was... I found some  goodness. So we had some  little differences, 

but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. I liked them. I had a lot of foreign, foreign 

students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there, 

than if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. Here I 

had a chance to talk to professors. It was just a very relaxed atmosphere.  
 

Q: Were you feeling surprised that you™d been to several very different places in the 
country, with very different atmospheres.Were you surprised at how much variation 

there was in this country, that you had kind of come to expecting a certain, maybe– 
 

A: Uniformity. 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Well, I reported back, I remember to my relatives, and parents, I said, ﬁThis is not a 
country, this is a continent.ﬂ I said, ﬁDon™t think in terms of a country, this is a 

continent.ﬂ It™s... it will be that way for a long, long time, and I think it still is. When I 

travel, in spite of the uniformity that modern age brings, you can still see that it is... it™ll 

take a long time, and perhaps it shouldn™t, perhaps this is the way it should be, that we 

still have areas that... like you can open your eyes and realize that you are not in Chicago, 

or not in New York.  And hope that they will keep it this way. 
 

Q: Well, you talked a little bit, in your first interview about what happened then, and how 
you... how you had gone from... it was after you got your Master™s degree, you went from 

Fresno to teaching, in a special ed school, in Marin county, and you me ntioned you had 

a... you had wanted to go there because you had girlfriend in the area. And do you want 

to say anything more about that time, or do you want to go on to saying some thing 

about... I™d be interested in hearing how you me t Jan and what... kind of how your 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
89 
 
relationship grew, and was built, and whethe
r... and what she knew about your past and 
what you talked... I™m getting ahead of myself. Why don™t– 
 
A: No, that™s okay. 

 

Q: ... you answer my first question first. 

 

A: Yeah, well, the... when I arrived at the Bay Area, for me  that was just incredible.  I 
practically pinched myself every morning when I woke up and I saw the sun and looked 

around, and the scenery. I just couldn™t believe that I was that lucky. I just couldn™t find 

words to describe it to my parents, the beauty of the area and the very uniqueness that the 

San Francisco Bay Area had for me. And still, it holds just a fascination. It™s almost like 

Europe in the United States, when I walked the streets of San Francisco. I lived in 

Tiburon... Belvedere... no, Tiburon, I™m sorry. I lived in Tiburon, Belvedere is just next 

door, which at that time was affordable for a bachelor schoolteacher like myself. Today, 

of course, it would be impossible. And I had a nice little apartment in a duplex, 

overlooking what they call Raccoon Straight. And these are small, little islands in the 

bay. The sailboats were going back and forth all day. Tourists, you know, boats, and it 

was just a very, very picturesque environmen
t. The type of people I associated with, 
ma inly through school, through my job, were very pleasant. Most of them were very 

young, and we did a lot of things together. I al
so had plenty of opportunity, of course, to 
go on my own. And those days, I just was a restless spirit. I had a tendency to walk down, 

for example, at night, and see the streets... th
e lights of San Francisco, and just feel that 
there is something going on in the city that I™m not part of, and I just have to hop into my 

car and go there. And I did that, and it was then fifteen mi nutes, twenty mi nutes, I was in 

the city, going around. And so then, I was walking around and I was happy, and I did a 

couple of things. And then I looked back and I saw the lights of Belvedere or Tiburon or 

Sausalito, and I felt that there... something must be going on and I™m not part of it, so I 

hopped in my car and went back. So I was just restlessly looking for that unknown beauty 

which really was just around me , all over. And I loved to hike up on Mount Tama lpais. 

Mill Valley, all those communities were very unique to me, and I thought I would live 

my life here, probably forever. 
 

Q: What year was it?  What year was it when you arrived?  

 

A: 1961. And, as I me ntioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching 
mentally retarded students, but I didn™t mi nd, because I thought of the old Hungarian 

proverb that said for any... for some thing that you like, you would even let people chop 

wood on your back, and I strongly believe in this. And so, I just... I didn™t really consider 

teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. As a matter 

of fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal 

and devoted to you. Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed 

kids, who were in this group, too. But basically, it was easy, because of their love and 

devotion. And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
90 
 
I™m burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I returned to regulating... 
teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. And my wife, yeah, I met my 

wife at a teacher™s meeting, and our superiors,
 our admi nistrators, were a rather strange 

bunch of people, who had some times very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to 

do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we 

would never have dusty shoes. And saying this to people who had to go out in the 

playground almost every hour, I mean it was strange. And they criticized the way we 

dressed or what we said, or we looked, and 
they didn™t much do it to me, but to... because 
I was a ma n, and I was the only ma n on the faculty of the county, but ma inly to wome n. 

And... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. And she 

struck me  as a kind of a person who doesn™t really want others to know much about her. 

And I found out later there was a reason for that. Then– and we just discussed things, 

and I in my mi nd said, ﬁOh, this lady™s quite cold.ﬂ That was my first impression. And 

never bothered really much. But, our path crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she 

was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me 

up, and... 
 

Q: Mentally retarded teachers, or students? 

 

A: I™m sorry. No, teachers of retarded students. And she called me  up and she wanted my 
advice in something, which I still maintain, even up today, it was just a device to strike 

of...

Tape 9, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. 

 

A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not 
very warm. And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for 

some help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn™t call 

me  and ask for help. And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on, 

occasionally, we called each other. But we never talked about personal things, and so, the 

whole thing kind of petered out. And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to 

a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, ﬁOh, by the way, Jan got a divorce. She 

is divorced, and she looks good.ﬂ And according to... excuse me ... according to Jan, I 

said, ﬁWow,ﬂ which I deny. I never said such thing. But anyway, this, or whatever I did, 

or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her. So they 

invited her and kind of ma tched us together one evening, and we hit it off just right. And 

from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was 

a pretty serious relationship. But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just 

was not going to get married without giving it 
some  thought. So, I did what my previous 

girlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in Germany. And 

I arrived there, and I spent a year in Germany, and that year convinced me that yes, that 

she would be the right person for me , so I came home. And we got ma rried on Mount 

Tama lpais, on the top of Mount Tama lpais, the mountain I loved to hike around, and the 

mountain we both saw every day, comi ng and going to school. 
 

Q: How old were her children at that point?  

 

A: Five, six and eight. 

 

Q: Did they ask you about your experiences dur
ing the war at some point, or did you tell... 
did they know anything about your history?   
 

A: Interestingly, they were more interested then, than they are now. As little children, they 
kept asking me  a lot, and these days, as adults, if we meet, ma ybe they fear they knew... 

they heard everything. But I am surprised that my sons, who are writing all the time, just 

as a pastime, never really ask any questions. And they are around movies concerning the 

Holocaust and... back those days. But no. But back then yes, yes, and I told them quite a 

bit, and it was not really that much about the Holocaust. They were too little, and I didn™t 

want to, of course, cause nightma res, but it was ma inly just life, what was life when I 

grew up and what I... the things I did, and they were fascinated by my accent, and they 

begged us to have another child, so he or she could have an accent. They thought that a 

baby is going to be born with an accent. And they laughed at my mi stakes that I ma de, 

because sometimes they were really funny. And inadvertently, I did say certain things 

that just sounded very strange, and still are a saying in the family. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
92 
 
Q: Suchas? 
 

A: Pardon me ?  Such as, I... for a long time, I thought that fungus is really fangus, and so 
everybody called fungus a fangus. Once I told them some thing about a lawyer, and I... 

instead of lawyer, I kept saying liar. And they couldn™t understand, and in the end they 

said, the difference is of no... when I learn, I said, ﬁGod, there is no difference, lawyers, 

liars, what™s the difference? ﬂ And so there were ma ny cute episodes. Drift and draft, I 

remember I had trouble distinguishing that. ﬁClose the... close the door, because there is a 

drift.ﬂ And so ever since, everybody called it drift and not draft. 
 

Q: What about Jan?  Did you talk with Jan about your much... in the early times of your 
getting to know each other, about your experiences during the Holocaust, and about just 

the Holocaust in general? 
 

A: Yes. There is no problem there. She really wanted to know everything and I told her 
everything. And she read a great deal. And, as a ma tter of fact, she is my police woma n, 

because she doesn™t allow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television, 

because she says I have such nightmares that she doesn™t want to wake me up and it 

just... too much trouble. But I was amazed that after we got married, how much time 

she... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books on Jewish history, and then, of 

course, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks. She has Jewish cookbooks and she 

knows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when some body ask me  

about some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her, because 

she knows a lot more about it than I do. I just, because of my indifference to religion, I 

just never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the 

background, but she did. And of course, ther
e was never any question about conversion, 

anything like this, because I myself, I was not practicing.  
 

Q: How... was her family accepting of you?  

 

A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got ma rried, the person who probably wouldn™t 
have liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone. Her mother was 

a very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married. So, the only 

relatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20
th
-Century human 
beings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people.  
 

Q: Okay, so you stayed in the Bay Area until 1974, is that right? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. What did you think of... were you aware of what was going on with the... with the 
Summe r of Love, and the Free Speech Moveme nt and all that stuff that was happening in 

Berkeley, and San Francisco in the late sixties?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
93 
 
A: Oh yes. By the time I arrived in the Bay Area, and even before that, as soon as I could 
understand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene 
very much. For example, I remember when I... even before I settled in the Bay Area, I 

would come  up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to North Beach, in 

San Francisco, to the beatnik coffeehouses, and just listen, or converse sometimes with 

people. I really enjoyed the beatnik era. I liked those people, they were very introspective 

and intelligent. There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I 

appreciated. Occasionally, when some body played the piano, they were sipping the 

coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading. They 

were all part of the scene. That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to North 

Beach. Then, later on, of course, after we were ma rried, after I came back from Europe, 

from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything 

started, especially the Vietnam War flared up. And our family was very much involved in 

that. We were going over to the city, and I remember making big signs. My wife joined 

the Another Mother for Peace movement. We were demonstrating, and there was a very 

cute episode that happened to us. She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, 

and bought a very nice, flowery ma terial to ma ke a dress. And we went to a big 

demonstration over in Berkeley, and had to ma ke our own signs. And we were getting the 

signs ready and all of a sudden, we l
ook down on our youngest son, Kevin™s sign, and 

what did we see?  A beautiful flower, of some  textile, and if we looked at it, then we 

realized it was her dress material that she had bought. He was so fascinated by the 

pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had 

to have flowers on your signs, that he didn™
t think twice, and he was cutting out the 
flowers from... what... we didn™t know what to 
do about it, and then we decided just to 
talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn™t get punished. So 

that was Vietnam. My sister-in-law wrote 
to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told 
him that she fears that he should not run again. And interestingly, about three days later, 

he came out and he announced that he would not run. So that... we felt that the family can 

take some credit for that decision. But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a 

lot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting 

times, very unique times. And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be 

much duller than it was back then. We also lived, by that time, in Inverness, in an area 

that was in the center of all these cults, and rock bands and so the kids were exposed to 

all these people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the hills. It 

had advantages, it had disadvantages. The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter 

what parents would say to their children, they always had a place to go and because these 

rock groups had open house, you could help yourse
lf at the fridge, or whatever, eating, or 
no ma tter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it. 

And so it was in a... in the sense, difficult. And ma ny of our children in the area, were 

runaways. They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.  
 

Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about 
the Holocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to 

them?  And did you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
94 
 
were you relating to the culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity? 
 
A: Mm-hm. Now that is a very surprising question, because I never really thought about it, 
but as you were asking me, I realize I didn™t really think much about myself any more, as 

a Holocaust survivor. I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak. I was 

more involved in what is happening in America, and thought more about it day by day, 

than to think too much, to give too much thought about the past. So, in this respect, it was 

good, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts. So I think it, it was a good 

thing for me , in this respect. And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and, 

rather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were 

oppressed. 
 

Q: But you did have nightma res about the past, you me ntioned that. 

 

A: Only... only it usually... it was provoked by wa
tching some television story, or reading 
some thing in the newspaper. Otherwise, they were going away, they were becomi ng 

distant. 
 

Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you™re... you™re there in this nation that had 
perpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history 

there, than your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States. Was it a bigger 

issue that The Holocaust?  Was it more of a... did it have more of a place in your life and 

did you talk about it with people?  
 

A: The... now, this is a very complex story. When we lived in Germany, which was from 
1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a We st Germany and East 

Germany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were 

bringing it into the open. It was not something hushed up under the rug. There were 

discussions about it in schools. I spoke about it to high school students, mainly. The 

whole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, 

really started after the Unification. Now, I must also say that there weren™t too many 

people who were alive in World War II, by this time. Because I was fifteen when the war 

ended, and I am seventy now, almost. And so, most people are dead, who were in World 

Wa r II. Now of course, it doesn™t mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was 

dead. Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that it was the proper 

thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was 

a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. It would have been totally 

superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn™t have made any difference. I rather 

concentrated on talking to people of the mi ddle and the younger generation. And I found 

that intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. They were very 

ashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. I 

felt that they were progressive enough. The younger German generation amazed me, 

because I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light. 

How... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germany 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
95 
 
joining. A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, 
only West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according 

to East Germany, were in We st  Germany. So, those people had no background, and they 

had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it. And this is why 

the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, East 

Germany, even today. Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a 

very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification 

didn™t bring immediate remedies to all their problems. So they had to again go back and 

blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren™t too many. So, 

since they couldn™t attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past. 
 

Q: You were living in Frankfurt at the time that the Wall... that the Berlin Wall came down?  

 

A: Mm-hm. 

 

Q: Do you... Did you foresee any of this?  Did you, at the time... what were your emotions at 
the time, and your thoughts at the time that the Wall came down and you were seeing 

the... that there was this... unification was going to be happening?  
 

A: Oh, I think that everybody basically felt the same, that we lived truly in a moment of 
history that is... has just very, very few companions. That it was something extraordinary. 

And now, just a couple of years before, nobody would have thought that in our lifetime, 

something like this will happen. But of course, after the Soviet regime collapsed, then, 

then, it was inevitable. It still, it was a surprise, and it was naturally something that will 

always be in my mi nd, because just a few weeks before, my granddaughter, who was 

about fifteen at that time, came to Europe and we went to the Wa ll in Berlin, and we had 

pictures of her just standing by, and I was telling her that you can bring back your 

children here, probably, and maybe even your grandchildren one day, and the Wall will 

still be here. And so, no, nobody anticipated such a rapid disintegration. 
 

Q: Did your... have you talked to your grandchildren about... have they been interested in a... 
in your experiences during the Holocaust, or ask you questions about– 
 

A: Yes, the... my granddaughter who is twenty-four... I™m sorry, twenty-four?  No, no, 
twenty-two, I talk to her, she knows quite a bit about the Holocaust. And we usually go 

together to movies, not necessarily related to the Holocaust but sometimes do, like, we 

saw, ﬁLife is Beautifulﬂ together, and I ma ke a 
point to take her to movies that deal with 
history... modern history, or the Holocaust, so we can talk about it. I want her to know 

everything. The, the... I have two grandsons and I took them too, to the Holocaust 

Museum. And they are at the... they were at the age, they went through too fast for my 

taste, but I hope one day they will go back and they will slow down. And the other... 

grandchildren, or potential grandchildren, are still too young to say anything.  
 

Q: So, when you were in Germany, you were teaching... were you teaching American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
96 
 
students?  
 
A: Yes, I was teaching a regular American 
high school, where The American Army and the 
American diplomat™s kids would go. Just lik e any other high school. We  had a... that was 

a school district, just like an American sc
hool district. It was funded by the same  way, 
and operated the same  way and everything was the same , only the scene was Frankfurt, 

Germany. 
 

Q: Did you know... did you have other Jewish friends in Germany at the time who had been 
through the Holocaust?  
 

A: No, no, I did not have any. I had some  German friends and we talked about the 
Holocaust, and they knew about me, but it... we never really made it into a big deal, and I 

never really wanted to make it a big deal, I didn™t want them to think that I solely exist 

and ma intain the friendship to kind of pound in the subject. They knew about me , they 

knew about my life, and we discussed it in... on very civil terms, and I knew that they 

were genuinely interested and sorry for what happened. But, other than that, no, no, I did 

not have any other– occasionally, my high school teacher friend, the German couple, 

they invited me to their schools, to talk. And Germans amazed me because, in our house, 

for example, there was a lady who was a farmer™s daughter, and she was in a... kind of a 

mi d-level managerial job with a pharmaceutical company and she had constantly friends 

from Israel, and she was not Jewish. I had another... I have another very old friend in 

Germany, I me t back in the early 1960™s, and we have been friends ever since, and she 

has friends constantly visiting her from Israel
. She™s also not Jewish. So, there™s a lot of 
contact between Israel and Germany, and well, I don™t know whether this is a result of 

a... of a bad conscience or some thing, but certainly you cannot hold some body who was 

not even alive at that time responsible for anything that happened. No, that would be 

unreasonable. But it™s not... today, it™s not a bi
g issue. It is a sad fact of history, 

especially in the western part of Germany. 
 

Q: Did you have thoughts at that time, of where you wanted to stay, whether you wanted to 
stay in Germany and settle there, and make your home there, or did you picture comi ng 

back to the United States at some point?   
 

A: Oh, I could have stayed in Germany, by the sheer coincidence of my name , which is a 
German name  and the fact that I was, for a few month, a German citizen, in World War 

II. And that was just for a few months, so I didn™t include in any citizenship, just by a 

mi stake and because of the strange happenings of the times. They classified me  as 

German in Hungary, and temporarily we were considered Germans, and of course the 

whole thing was... oh, they only lasted for a few month when they found out who we 

were. But that little episode and my name, and the fact that the reason the Hungarians 

tossed us out, besides being Jewish, they discovered that one of my great-grandparents 

was born in what is called Sudetenland, which was a part of German speaking 

Czechoslovakia, which was at that time, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and all back, it all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
97 
 
connects together, and it all added up to some very tragic events, because we were not 
considered Hungarians, and my grandfather was deported to Auschwitz, not because he 

was Jewish, but because of they said he wa
s a foreigner. He could not prove that his 
grandfather was a Hungarian, which was not true. But because of this, and other reasons, 

I could have gotten German citizenship. I could have gotten, probably, a great deal of 

money that way, because of what happened to my family in World Wa r II, and all this, 

but I never had, for a second, a thought. I mean, how can I think about settling in 

Germany, and taking German citizenship?  There are so many reasons why I shouldn™t 

have done this, right?  Number one is an emotional thing, a rational thing to... that would 

be a little bit too much for me to bear. Second is that I have an American family, and my 

wife was ready to return to the United States. There no way would she have stayed in 

Europe with me . So, I knew that this was temporary, and I enjoyed while it lasted.

Tape 9, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. Do you want to say 
anything else about Germany before we go on?  
 

A: I just want to say that I know that, for the purpose of the interview, you™re interested in 
anti-Semitism and where did I run into the most, and I must say that the country where I 

ran into the most anti-Semitic and Fascist remarks, and... is Austria. And I was amazed 

that the... so many years after the war, I don™t see a lot of changes. That here is a country 

that, unlike Germany, was considered a victim of Fascism, which of course, it was not, 

and played this role very successfully. And today, it is just terrible. It™s, the right wing 

elements are all over it. And you can go to any pub and just wait until they have a few 

drinks, and there will be some  talk about the good old days. So, no, I thought Germany 

dealt with the problem much, much better than Austria.  
 

Q: So you came to the U.S. in 1993, you returned. Did you come  straight to Kentucky?  

 

A: Yes, yes, we came here straight from 
Frankfurt, Germany, we landed in Lexington. And 
by that time, we had a little home, because my brother and sister-in-law, who own 

Briarbrook Farm, had called us two years before, and asked us if we would like to buy a 

home here for a very, very little money, and that sounded just like a good investment. My 

wife, of course, imme diately knew it was going 
to be our home. I just considered maybe 

just an investment. We bought it, and then slowly, she worked on me to retire here. 

Because I had no intention to come here. I wanted to be near a big city and I loved 

California. And she insisted that she did not
 want to go back to California, even though 
she lived all her American life there, and so she won. We ll, she followed me  to Europe 

for twenty years, and I thought it is proper to honor her wishes and whatever they were, 

but basically, she wanted to be close to her sister and vice-versa, so we came here, and at 

least we could be in driving distance, within a day, to our daughter in Virginia and to our 

son and her... and his family in Nashville. So, that was an... also another consideration.  
 

Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about
 Kentucky in general?  Did you consider it 
to be kind of a backwards place, or did you have... had you heard any stereotypes about 

it? 
 

A: We ll, we used to visit here, almost every summe r when... while we were in Europe, every 
second summe r or so, we would come  back and stop here, too, for a few days. And so I 

could... I was always very defiant when it came to this place, I just... I never really 

opened my eyes as to what is here, rather would sulk so... not in a very obvious way, but 

call it an inside sulker. That™s what I was, sitting on the couch during the day, and 

occasionally complaining that there is really not much to do here. And this was going on, 

I was... I never really came here with great enthusiasm. As I put it to my wife, an area 

that doesn™t even have sidewalks in town, to walk around, what am I going to do there?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
99 
 
And also the fences bothered me , that you can™t go anywhere, everything is fenced in. 
And how can you take your mountain bike and, and bike some where?  You run into a 

fe nce within mi nutes. And I was just not very much for settling here. And then, I knew 

that she was very insistent, and the last time we were visiting here, I think it was in ™91, 

that was shortly after we bought that little house... people were still living in it, the 

partners of the farm, and I was walking around, and all of a sudden, the... my past caught 

up with me, because I spent a great deal, as a young kid, out in nature, and I loved the 

smells and the... I loved the sight of a tree, the smell of the grass. And all of a sudden, I 

began to smell and look at the very things that were so dear to me when I was little and I 

was constantly hiking with my friends. And I realized that this is not a bad place, and 

besides, it was so peaceful. At night there was no noise. And so I came back and the 

whole family was around because they were... we were celebrating our wedding 

anniversary. And I said, ﬁI want to say something to you.ﬂ I said, ﬁI just made up my 

mi nd, I can live here very well.ﬂ And that was the end. All my sulking went away, all my 

reservations went away. I knew I was not going to come  to the mi ddle of New York City. 

I knew that there is not going to be any half-timbered houses when I walk into Paris. But 

I thought that I can make the best of it, and that I can live here. 
 

Q: Did you have concerns culturally, what it would be like?  

 

A: Yes, that was my main concern. I knew that this is a beautiful state and if I drive an hour 
from here, I can start hiking and it is really an... an open range, but culturally, I had 

reservations and I still have reservations. I feel a little... I would have really felt much 

worse, perhaps twenty, thirty years ago, but at the time when television brings you, 

especially the educational channel and the history channel and Discovery and there are so 

ma ny channels now that you can get, that brings... they bring a lot of good 

knowledgeable stuff, and this is one thing. Second, of course, the internet connects you 

with the world. So, one is not so isolated any more. Still, I am still yearning to go to a 

town where the streets are crowded. I don™t want to live on a crowded street all the time, 

but some times, and I want to go to a sidewalk café, and I want to eat some  different food 

that doesn™t taste the same, and just converse with people. I feel that there is, right now in 

this country, there is great suspicion. You just can™t walk up to people and start talking. 

And Kentucky is even better off in this respect than any other state, probably, or most 

other states. It just... there is always that suspicion in a person™s mi nd, based on all the 

stories that we hear day by day by day by day, of violence. Violence really kind of 

poisoned the atmosphere in this country a great deal, and I™m very sensitive to that. So, I 

would love to just go to a park and sit on a bench sometimes, and just talk to strangers, as 

I used to when I was younger. But that™s impossible. We don™t go to the park to begin 

with, because there are no... not ma ny parks, and there aren™t... not too ma ny people, if 

you find a park. And when it gets dark, of 
course, you clear out, and you just don™t have 
that kind of a life, that vibrant life that you find still in European cities. 
 

Q: Do you... Have you formed relationships with people just in the community in Paris?  
Neighbors, do you spend time in, in that town?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
100 
 
 
A: We ll, with neighbors, I just don™t have that much with... in common. One neighbor next 
to our farm is a hog farmer, and I don™t know anything about hogs and he doesn™t seem to 

be interested in many other things. And the others are way down. I go to Paris to take 

care of some  business that is necessary, post office or shopping, and this and that. And 

my hobbies... one of my hobbies is antiques, so I know the people who are in the antique 

business in Paris, and I can go in and spend some time and talk to them. But I do not have 

a close friend. Now my... however, my association with the so-called ma ster gardeners 

association in Lexington brought me together with people. I do volunteer work for the 

arboretum in season, every week, and so... one day, and these are the people, usually, that 

I am the closest to, because we have a common interest, gardening. We spend time 

together, we have meetings. And after the season is over, we continue seeing each other. 

So, yes, but since I came back... and that has also some thing to do, of course, with my 

age, too... I have not found here, anyone that I can call a friend.  
 

Q: Do you... do people ask you anything about yourse
lf, or have they reached out to you in 
any way?  Do they ask you about your accent, you know, people in town?  
 

A: Yeah, people are funny in this respect. They are interested my accent, and I cannot really 
say that they are suspicious or they reject me. One man, a young man told me this last 

year. Said, ﬁYou know, you are much better off than I.ﬂ And he said, ﬁYou open your 

mouth, and everybody says, ‚Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from? ™ ﬂ And he said, 

ﬁI open my mouth and they say, ‚Hey, you are not from here, are you? ™ And you know 

what they mean,ﬂ he says, ﬁthat I™m a damn Yankee.ﬂ And I don™t know about this, but 

all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent. I see that 

sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and  I know why they do it and I consider it 

a friendly gesture. And that™s about it. The only people I™m really mad at, the ones who 

listen to me for awhile and say, ﬁWhat™s that? ﬂ Because I know that they are putting me 

on. That– if schoolchildren could understand me , they could, too. But... and another 

thing that, of course irritates me, when– my hearing is not that good any more, and this 

has nothing to do with accent and all this, it™s just that some people are very intolerant, 

and if you ask, you know, ﬁWill you please repeat it? ﬂ They just say, ﬁForget it.ﬂ And the 

word forget it really irritates me. But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign 

born.  Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about 

being suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other states that I™ve travelled. 
 

Q: Did you say awhile... ma ybe the first interview we did, at that time were you working 
with the Historical Society in Paris, or with the museum?  Do you still do that at all, or– 
 

A: No, I don™t do it any more, and frankly, I can™t even come  up with a good reason why. 
Perhaps it™s just that I get very busy at home, and the... somehow, the familiar faces that I 

knew, ma ny of them left and I... it™s very difficult, I think, after a certain age, to ma ke 

friends and to build kind of a circle around yourself. And also when I first joined, the 

Historical Society was a lot more vital than it is now. I think it just settled into a routine 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
101 
 
life, and it just... I was just not interested any more. The museum was established, it™s 
running smoothly. I don™t think they really need me there any more. So I rather 

concentrate on the Master Gardener™s Association, where I can do something, actually 

work. I am always much happier when I can do physical work, than when I just sit 

around and talk about what to do.  
 

Q: Have you taken a particular interest in Ke ntucky history since you™ve been here, or in 
learning about that?  
 

A: I... well, not strictly speaking Kentucky history, 
but I did take my first class, last year, in 
the history of Cincinnati. Cincinnati fascin
ated me  from the very beginning, because 
when I saw it, I said, this is the closest thing, around here, to a real city. The others seem 

like villages, all of them. I can™t think of any place in Kentucky, that to me, looks like an 

urban environment. And the... most of the places are, you know, just built very quickly 

and the original downtown... unfortunately, Le
xington is destroyed, as we know it, and 
what is left of it is just struggling. Now, yeah, Cincinnati, yes. I was so interested in 

Cincinnati, and Cincinnati™s history, that I took 
a class, a whole week Elder Hostel class. 
I like to take classes with Elder Hostel, and it™s usually a hands-on class, but this time I 

ma de an exception, ‚cause I wanted to know the history, background, and more about the 

area. And it was not just Cincinnati, it wa
s northern Kentucky, too. It was very good. So 
I™m hoping to do some  more. And of course, here and there I read a book about 

Kentucky. I take some  authors who are local and look into their works, and David Dick 

lives in the area, and his books... so, I am. But I am not really an expert on Kentucky 

history, I leave this to people who are natives. I just have a kind of a... really a surface 

interest in just the basics. 
 

Q: Do you feel that you can stay here and live here and be at home here for the rest of your 
life?  Is that something you think about?  
 

A: Oh, I settled this already with myself. That™s it. This is my last station. I am here for 
good, and naturally, this is not a bad place to be, and even though I mi ght... I could think 

of some other places where I would rather live, but I am here now, and I make the best of 

it. So...  
 

Q: It seems like you could, if you look back on... on your whole life and where you came 
from and what your experiences have been, th
at you could say to yourself that this was 

almost the last... last place that you would have landed. You think?  
 

A: Yes. I wouldn™t have chosen it, back thirty or forty years ago, no way. Because at that 
time I still was more, somehow I felt that I... that there was still a great deal to discover. 

And I know that, now that I reached the age, 
and considering the fact that I have heart 
problems, that I can™t just jump around any more. And even though I would love to visit 

some other corners of the world, and our country, I have to take it easy, and this is 

basically a very good point to be. I really like to explore more of the eastern part of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
102 
 
United States. That™s a very good place to be, and the fact that we lead here, otherwise in 
kind of a Norman Rockwell type life, with my brother and sister-in-law, that here... we 

have been here for six years... almost six years now, and we never had a conflict, not 

even a mi nor one. We eat our meals together quite a bit. We go, usually together to the 

theater or a party or something. We do a lot of things together. We are... they are our 

companions, and we are theirs. And so I... considering all this, I am very happy, and at 

peace.  
 

Q: Have you encountered any anti-Semitism since you™ve been here to Kentucky?  

 

A: No, no. I have never heard anything like this. I think there are so ma ny... so few Jews 
here. Of course, that doesn™t mean anything, 
there are very few Jews left in Poland, and 

there™s still anti-Semitism, but no. 
 

Q: And then you me ntioned that you talk...  have been talking with school groups. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Will you say something about what that experience is like? 

 

A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are 
very few people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what it is. 

And so, one schoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always 

invites me, about two, three times a year. And last time, it was a closed circuit television 

that they put me  on, with some  other classes around Kentucky. And... but most of the 

time, I just talk to her classes... her combined classes or some other teachers bring in 

classes, and these are usually kids, thirteen, fourteen years old, and I like to talk to them, 

because that™s how old I was when the real disaster hit me . And so I can kind of get down 

to their level of understanding and explain certain things to them. And I find that they are 

very receptive, very receptive. So, I consider it a mi ssion. 
 

Q: Are these students... is this Bourbon county schools?  

 

A: Yes, Bourbon county school system. I™ve never been to the Paris school system, but it™s 
Bourbon county, which is, just basically, geographically speaking, it™s also in the city, 

they just split, I don™t know why. And so I talk to the Bourbon county schools. I spoke to 

the high school last year, but mainly it™s the mi ddle school. 
 

Q: Do you find that the students are they all familiar with the terminology, the term 
Holocaust?  Do they know... do they have a basic grasp of what happened?  
 

A: The mi ddle school students, because of the teacher™s eagerness to clarify everything, are 
much better informed than the high school students. I was amazed. I went to the high 

school, I... once I went to Berea and talked to the Berea class, and that was the worst. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
103 
 
They were just uninterested, sleepy people with
 a professor who, himself, put me  asleep. 
I just couldn™t blame the students, by that time, they were so turned off, that no matter 
what I did, I could have stripped nude, and it wouldn™t have ma de much of a difference in 

that class. But the mi ddle-school kids, the juni or high, they are just great to talk to. One 

girl... just yesterday, I was speaking to a class, and one little girl stayed behind, and I 

usually spend about an hour and a half with them. I speak to them for awhile and then let 

them ask questions. And one little girl was just stay... just stood behind and she was 

waiting for me , waiting for me , when after everybody left, she came up, and she hugged 

me, and she kissed me, and she said, ﬁThis is all... for all the mi ssed loves and kisses that 

you could not get from your parents during 
those years.ﬂ I thought that was just 
charmi ng. And she just turned around and left. It was... there was no other, you know, 

second thought about it. And so, it was just very, very beautiful.  
 

Q: Have you not...  I mean, well, you me ntioned you hadn™t experienced anti-Semitism, have 
you experienced anybody kind of asking you why don™t you go to church, or you know, 

kind of asking you what church do you go to, or just expecting you to be Christian?  
 

A: Yeah, I... that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot 
comprehend that, how can anybody who doesn™t steal, doesn™t cheat, doesn™t embezzle, 

has been married for thirty-three years, why am I not a church goer?  And that is what I 

have to explain many times to people. Not only that, when I say I™m a non-believer, of 

course, I think I™m out of their favors. And... but I try to make a point there, too, that one 

does not have to go to church and belong to a religion, to lead a decent life. And I say 

that. I look around and see how ma ny people who go to church are in the news, beating 

their wives and embezzling money from the school™s treasury, or from the county 

treasury or using highway funds for their own purposes. You don™t have to go. You can 

set your own rules. So, I do more argument about that than anything else.  
 

Q: Do you tell them that you™re... that you™re Jewish and that that™s part of the reason why?  

 

A: We ll, I tell them always. I™m not ma king any ________________. I am... I always say, 
I™m Jewish, but I am not a Jew... I am a Jew, but I™m not Jewish. And of course, first, 

nobody understands what I™m talking about. And I say, ﬁEthnically speaking, I am a Jew. 

I come from a ethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews.ﬂ I said, 

ﬁNow these people have been mi xed... intermingling with other people for over a 

thousand years, and therefore there is no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there™s no 

such thing as a pure anything any more, since history mi xed us up quite successfully. 

But, when it comes to religion,ﬂ I said, ﬁeven though I am a Jew, my religion is not 

Jewish. I have no religion.ﬂ I said, ﬁI am not ... I do not belong to any organized religion.ﬂ 

So eventually I think they understand what I mean. 
 

Q: Do you ever get any responses to that?  People getting into a conversation, or is that just 
kind of heads nodding, and then– 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
104 
 
A: We ll, of course there are always those who 
feel that they can perhaps sway me  over. And 
I always say, ﬁLook, I™m seventy years old, and you have no idea how ma ny people tried, 
and you are just wasting your time,ﬂ I said. And so eventually, they see that they are. So 

they give up and many of them still trust me and keeps talking to me, and there are those 

who kind of shy away, because I mi ght, you know, be who knows, the devil, or... you 

never know what they think of you if you say I™m a non-believer.  
 

Q: Oh, we™re about to end.

Tape 10, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. Okay, do you 
have any contact with other Holocaust survivors in Kentucky, or have you... do you know 

anything about anybody, besides you me ntioned some body earlier on?  
 

A: No, no, I don™t know anybody. And several times, my cardiologist, who is Jewish, and is 
very active in one of the synagogues in Lexington, mentioned that the rabbi is going to 

get in touch with me , because he wants me  to come  and talk to some  group within the 

congregation, but they never contacted me. I really don™t have any connection to any 

other group. 
 

Q: Do you feel any desire or any interest in having that kind of connection?  

 

A: I wouldn™t mi nd. I™m completely neutral. I am not going out of my way to look for it, 
and... because I don™t like to dwell that much upon past. And... but I wouldn™t reject if 

they... if they would want to establish any contact with me .  
 

Q: You live in a rural area of, you know, central Kentucky, and there are a lot of, I mean, as 
far as other... as far as mi nority groups, other than the main group, the... probably the 

main other group would be mi grant workers, and I™m interested in just hearing your... 

your perceptions of how people in the area deal with mi nority groups, and your 

observations about... about that, if you have any. 
 

A: I consider this very similar to what was going on in Germany while we lived there. 
Germany had an economic boom in the 1950™s, just like we have now, which meant that 

the... all the menial and dirty jobs were unfilled. Most Germans just wouldn™t want to 

work in that, and also that they needed more workers than the country actually could 

produce. So they invited in other nationalities as guest workers, that™s what they were 

called, and they were ma inly from Turkey. And this was back in the 50™s. The German 

economic mi racle produced a mi gration from Turkey, which was legal, completely legal. 

They had to have documents, they entered, they went to work in the factories. Now, 

today, in 1993... 1999, the economy... the German economy has slowed down 

considerably. These Turkish workers, the original Turkish workers, today are 

grandparents. They brought their children back then, it was allowed, which was, I think, a 

very nice, humanitarian gesture, because Switzerland, who had the same problem, did not 

allow family me mbers to follow. They could go home on vacation, send the money back, 

but nobody was allowed to... allowed to come . So, the family me mbers came, and you 

know, one family me mber then brings another family me mber, and pretty soon... I think 

today there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five 

million people. That™s quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some 

people to begin with. But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on, 

the real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were 

already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. So now, here

came the problem of what to do with them. Are they citizens, are they not citizens? And 
welfare, are they qualified for welfare? So, I 
am afraid of the same  thing here. Right now, 
especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these 

illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. They are working here 

in a job that most other people wouldn™t take. So, nobody has great reservations. When 

they see... I heard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or 

a murder happened, and it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I 

don™t consider this extraordinary. But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when 

this economic boom ends, and here we will be with these people. Now, they are not going 

to work. If they don™t work, what will happen to them?  To their mi nd?  What will happen 

to those who watch around, and will take the opportunity to do the same  as they do in 

Germany. The skinheads in Germany were burning down the buildings where they lived. 

People died in fi re, they were beaten up on the street, or they were killed. Several, several 

times this happened. So, I hope that we™d... it doesn™t come to this. I think that the... we 

need more education, especially in the schools, to make these people welcome. They are 

here for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in America, they came 

in by the same rights. If there is illegal immi gration, that is not for Kentucky to try to stop 

it, because we can™t, it has to be stopped down on the border, that™s not our problem. But 

those who are here, they are here. So what are you going to do?  But the churches, the 

schools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that 

these are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily. 

They are not here temporarily.  
 

Q: Do you draw... when you think about this issue, does you mi nd draw parallels to your 
own experience, and experience of Jews in Europe?  I mean, even though it™s not... I 

mean, with the Jews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of 

years and they certainly belonged there, but... but the idea of some  kind of economic 

problems making one majority group turn against a mi nority group and persecuting them. 

Do you think that makes you particularly– 
 

A: Yeah,yes– 

 

Q:  ... sensitive?  

 

A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison. I... definitely, that– they 
would be made scapegoats, the mi nute the chips begin to fall. But I don™t think that in 

America we ever have a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more. I 

know that we had them, of course, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the 

Japanese Americans in the West coast, but I don™t think that would ever come to this. I™m 

more afraid of individual treatment of these people. 
 

Q: Incidents like skinheads getting– 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them

realistically, that we let their children come to school without any reservation, because 
children in the world everywhere, ma kes no difference where they come  from, where 

they go, they should be in school. And number two is that we do not go overboard with 

bilingual education. These kids know how to speak Spanish, they should know how to 

speak English, and even the families, I think, would appreciate the fact, that we would 

just throw them into an English speaking class, and I can guarantee that in three months, 

they would speak English, without even an accent.  
 

Q: The one thing that I... that I mi ssed as
king was about your parents. I... you me ntioned, 
maybe in the last interview, that they came to the States, to visit for your wedding. 
 

A: Mm-hm. Not for my wedding. 

 

Q: Not for your wedding?  

 

A: Mm-mm,no. 

 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: They came in 1967 to visit. They were here, I think, six weeks or seven weeks. And my 
mother, of course, would have loved to stay he
re. My father, he was just used to his life 
in Budapest, and he was very anxious, eventually, to get back. So there was no question 

that they would stay here. And my father, who has always been around little businesses 

in his life, he did the usual thing that people at that time did, from Eastern Europe, 

traveling to the West, they were constantly counting what... certain prices on 

me rchandise, it would cost in Hungary, in Hungarian money. I mean, I was thinking 

about getting him a little calculator, but he was so fast in his head, he would beat any 

calculator. So, his favorite place... and we lived in California when they were with us, 

was Long™s Drugstore, which is the equivalent of any big drugstore chain in our area. 

And he... he would just... if we did some thing, the rest of the family, with my mother, and 

he did not want to be part of it, he just 
said, ﬁOh, just drop me  at Long™s Drugstore,ﬂ and 
he would spend an entire day at L
ong™s Drugstore, looking... going around, looking 
everything, figuring out prices and this. So, yeah. 
 

Q: They– 

 

A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this ma n doing 
here, and he was smiling always, because he couldn™t speak a word of English. So, 

finally, I had to... I explained, I talked to the people, and said, ﬁThis is my father, he 

doesn™t speak any English, and he loves your store.ﬂ And this is all he did. We  drop him 

off here, he™s totally harmless. He never killed a fly in his life. He just likes to... and so 

they laughed, and they just... and eventually they all kind of tried to communicate with 

him and he with them. And another thing that... just blew his mi nd, that all you can eat 

little places in San Francisco. And we used to go to one that had very nice stuff, steam

table, of course. And he just could not unde
rstand that here, we were five, seven people 
go, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and so 
finally he said, ﬁI can™t,ﬂ he said, ﬁin Hunga
ry, a restaurant like this would go broke in 
one day.ﬂ So, my wife went to get the ma nager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and 

explain to her where my father come s from and what these questions are, so she sat down 

with us, and she said– ‚cause my father said, ﬁHow do you ma ke money, all you can 

eat? ﬂ  So, she then pointed out to my father, that look, ﬁHere is your granddaughter. Look 

what she has. She really didn™t take much. Look at your wife, she didn™t eat that much. 

Look at you, you didn™t eat that much. The two boys,ﬂ she said, ﬁthe two boys, okay, so 

they mi ght take up... up to the price that they paid, but look, all of you, you™re eat–ﬂ and 

so, she was very patiently explaining. She sai d, ﬁOur problem is not what people eat, it™s 

what people try to put into their jacket.ﬂ She says, ﬁYou™d be surprised how many people 

come in here with a bag, and all this.ﬂ My father could not understand this, that even in 

America people– because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view of America. But I 

forgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long™s Drugstore, he learned 

this sentence to say. First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how to 

say in English, so the children can understand. He says, ﬁThis country is invincible.ﬂ 

After looking at the drugstore, he made up his mi nd, that based on this wealth that is in 

this... just in this store, and the way people just come  in and can afford and buy, all this... 

he said, ﬁThis country, my son, is invincible.ﬂ He had unlimited faith in this country. And 

I don™t know whether in a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, ﬁWhy 

don™t you stay here? ﬂ He told them a joke. I think I– 
 

Q: Yeah, you did, you did, yeah. 

 

A: ... I say it, so I™m not going to repeat that, but he... he truly, he... with all the wealth, and 
everything else that just enchanted him, he... and the nice aesthetics of the stores, he was 

ready to go home. 
 

Q: What year did he die, he and your mother?  

 

A: My mother died in 1971, and my father died in, let™s see, 1980. 

 

Q: Had you seen them again, since... in between– 

 

A: Oh, well, I was there when my father was dying, yeah. I was in Germany, so they called 
me  and I come , and he had a stroke, and... but I was not with my mother when she was 

dying. My father just called me . So... but they have always been great supporters of the 

United States. 
 

Q: Do you have anything else that you™d like to add?  I™m about out of questions. 

 

A: We ll, if you give me  a couple of mi nutes– 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001 
  
 
109 
 
Q: Sure. 
 

A: ... You can stop that, and see if there™s anything else, okay?  

 

Q: Shall I pause it? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Are you involved with any other activities be
sides the Master Gardener™s Association? 
 

A: Yes, we are enthusiastic members of the Elder Hostel program. We  have... my wife, I 
think, participated in just about fifteen or 
so, and I am just about five behind. And what 
we usually do, we are taking hands-on type classes. My idea is that I want to know 

everything before I go, about... a little about a lot of things, such as I have always 

wondered about blacksmithing. What does a blacksmith do?  How does he do it?  So I 

took a class in blacksmithing. I took a class in kaleidoscope making, because that 

interested me ... me , too. How does a kaleidoscope work?  How do you ma ke one?  And I 

took several classes in wood turning, which I enjoy very much as a hobby. We  also took 

a beautiful class, which was not hands-on, but still something similar, to... in Hawaii, an 

Elder Hostel class for two weeks. We  were studying the volcanoes, the rainforest and 

then Polynesian culture. My wife is very active in basket weaving. She™s a member of the 

basket weavers... Kentucky Basket Weavers 
Association, or whatever... I don™t know if 
this is the official name, but she participates, she exhibits sometimes. Also, she™s a 

quilter, so as a quilter, she comes in contact with a lot of truly Kentuckians. And she 

doesn™t ever come home complaining that maybe they considered her an outsider. She 

feels very much at home with all these people. We also go to West Virginia, to Cedar 

Lake, which is also a - an Appalachian center for crafts, and take a hands-on class. Our 

next class, hopefully, we are on the waiting list, we have taken a class in Charleston and 

we want to go back, this is our next cla
ss. We  studied outdoor cooking and we are going 
back now to study Charleston™s gardens. We  take trips. 
 

Q: Is this West Virginia, or South Carolina?   

 

A: No, South Carolina, South Carolina, Charles... Charleston, South Carolina. And while 
there, we visited Virginia, Savannah, and we were fascinated by Savannah, it was just 

walking around in a European city. And in Kentucky, too, occasionally we take trips. We 

love to go, as I me ntioned, to Cincinnati. We  go up to Louisville. My wife, as a quilter, 

goes some times to western Kentucky, which is the quilter™s place, you know, Paducah is 

the quilter™s museum. In other words, we are active here, and I took the class in History 

of Cincinnati, in northern Kentucky. And I pl
an to... oh, I belong to the Sierra Club, The 
Nature Conservancy, a lot of conservationist organizations. I volunteered to participate in 

the Kentucky water watch program, which I enjoyed very much. It just ended with the 

Licking River, and the branch here in Paris, Stoner Creek, was our responsibility. Four 

times a year we had to go down and take samples, and... so that was, I felt I was part of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 & RG-50.549.05*0001

Kentucky, doing this. We  are... we try to stay active and my wife is ma inly involved with 
these quieter things, and I am... I like to get involved with something that takes me out in 

nature and puts me in a kayak, or out there, really fi ghting the elements. I still have a 

little bit of that spark. So, if I can manage, and if my heart gets better after the operation 

this fall, I™d like to buy a canoe or a kayak, one of the two, and just go on these little 

rivers here. So– 
 

Q: We ll, thank you. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Is there anything else?  
 
A: No, I don™t think so. That™s about it. I mean, I can™t... can™t really– 

 

Q: We ll, thank you. This concludes the... an interview with Robert Holczer.
