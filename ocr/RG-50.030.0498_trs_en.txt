Q: And she was selling shoes? 

A: She was selling shoes, and she never got a pair 
of shoes that fitted her. My dad used to say 
that was the trouble, because you used to work

of shoes to fit you. They were always hurting her.

Q: Heinz. 
A: Yeah, he passed away. 

Q: He passed away, uh-huh. Is that recent? 

A: Well, I can™t believe it, but I think it going in
to the fourth year. He died Thanksgiving day, I 
think it was to -- ‚01.  

Q: Uh-huh. Do you remember hi m when you were a 
kid?  When you were -- before the war, or 
you have no rec -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: You do? 

A: I do reme mber him, s ure. We  wer e  al
ways together, very close-knit, yes. 
Q: Now, he was four years older, yes? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And still you were -- 
A: Still. 
Q: So he -- was he a kind of protector for you? 

A: No, I think I protected him.  

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: How co me ?   

A: I don™t know, I just felt like 
he needed protection. I used 
to hit him and -- you know, in 
Vienna they used to say, if you want a -- 
a gi rl, you put sugar out on the windowsill. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
6 
 
A: So he used to put -- that™s what I heard, you 
know, put sugar there for he wanted a sister. And 
then when I was a little older he says, if I 
would have known, I would have never put sugar on. 
He really believed that, I guess, you know. 
Q: We re you bigger than he was? 

A: No, I was bigger -- bigger this way. 

Q: Broader. 

A: Broader, yeah. He was thin -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and blonde. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I was fat and dark. 

Q: And you were a bully. 

A: And I was -- I™m not a bully. Only to him.  
Q: Only to him.  
A: Only to him. He used to -- I used to jump on hi m and hit him, and -- 

Q: Why did you do that? 

A: Cause I guess he aggravated me . And then, he used to hold me . 

Q: Yes. 

A: And my mother used to say, you stupid, why 
you holding her?  I didn™t 
want her to fall down. 
So he -- in a way he was protecting me , you know. 

Q: Right. But you didn™t quite accept it. 

A: But it was nothing serious, you know. 

Q: Yes, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498

A: Nothing like what the 
children do nowadays, nothing.  
Q: Nothing like that. 
A: Nothing like that. 

Q: Did you start school before the wa r, a little bit? 

A: One year. 

Q: One year. 

A: Not quite a year.  

Q: I-In ki ndergarten? Or did they -- 

A: No, it was first class. 

Q: First class. 

A: First class. 

Q: Do you reme mber? 

A: I reme mb er s -- being very upset. I came home, 
cause the teacher told me
 to stand up, which I 
did, and she didn™t think I did, but 
I was so short that she thought I was still si tting down. Okay? 
That™s one thing. And then it was hard because it 
was -- I could already f
eel the tension in the 
first grade, and they were already beginning to 
be mean. And then -- I guess it was the tame -- 
time when Dad was in camp. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And Mom wasn™t home, and -- and my grandpa
rents did the best they
 could, you know, but it 
was -- we were all so upset with my dad, because
 for a long time  we didn™t even know where he 
was. 

Q: Did you see him taken? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
8 
 
Q: You didn™t. You were not home. 
A: No [inaudible]. He was taken 
in the street, because I was -- 
my brother and I were at our 
grandparents, cause things were not, you know, good. A
nd so Mother left us there, feeling that 
children with older people are safe, okay?  And sh
e went back with Dad to
 their apartment. And 
as she walked from their apartment to come to us
, they took him, just picked him up in the street. 
Q: While they were walking together? 

A: While they were walking together. They ju
st took him away. And -- and m -- Mother came by 
herself, and you know, they had like a 
staircase, I can just see it, lik
e a spiral staircase, and I was 
hanging there waiting for them. And I  looked down a
nd she is hysterical, they took Papa, they 
took Papa. And I didn™t know at firs
t what is she talking about, 
they took Papa. And then my 
grandparents came, you know, and -- and we got
 the picture, they took him. Just -- 
Q: Did you know who s he was talking about -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- did you realize that there were -- 
A: Yes, I realized there was danger, yes.  

Q: There was danger, yeah. 

A: As much as they tried to prot
ect us, not to tell us
 everything, some how we
 just felt inside the 
fear.  

Q: D-Do you -- 

A: You could feel it, yeah. 

Q: You could feel it. 

A: You could feel it. And then you saw them, 
you know, ma rching, and they came up the steps, 

you know, with their boots, and stuff, and you coul
d just feel creepy. And they never tried to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
9 
 
scare us, always tried -- oh, you know
, it™s going to be better. But yet she was so worried because 
she didn™t know where Papa was. So for four weeks we had no idea where he was. Then finally 
some body t old us that there -- a bunch of me n in 
a baseme nt, some place in ha -- so then she went 
there, and she finally saw him.  

Q: Still in Vi enna? 

A: You know, they waved -- still in Vienna -- wa vi
ng to her, and we knew that he was a smoker, 

so she was worried, you know, he s
hould have -- now we would take 
away cigarettes, but at that 
time she was worried that he™d be miserable without
 his cigarette. But they
 wouldn™t let her give 
him the cigarettes. Anyway, and then they took him 
away. All of a sudden he™s not there. So then 
again we waited to see where. And he was able
 to write finally, in 
fact, I have letters. 
Q: You do? 

A: Yes, I have letters that he wrote. 

Q: And he went to Dachau first? 
A: Dachau first, yeah. Yeah.  
Q: So your -- you and your brother 
Heinz are at your grandparents? 
A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

Q: And is it your m- mot her™s ma -- ma --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Your mother™s parents? 

A: Right. 

Q: We re they working?  We re the f -- was -- were they wer -- 

A: No, they were older. 

Q: They were older? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
10 
 
A: I mean, they were in -- in their 70™s, I guess. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: No, I don™t think they were working. 

Q: They were older. Well, it™s --  it™s all relative, isn™t it? 

A: Yeah. Well, my grandmother, I think sh
e -- we didn™t know what was wrong, but now 
thinking back, I think she had arthri
tis badly. But they didn™t have 
anything to give her to ma ke 
her feel better. She was-- but she never complained, she just sa
t in her chair, tried be warm, and 
I -- warm things on her. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my mother had one sister, which was 
not ma rried, so she was with them, you know, all 
the time . And that™s all. 

Q: So who really took care of you?  Your moth
er was living in their -- in that apartment. 

A: Yeah well, she -- she used to take 
care, but just when they took Papa -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- then she wasn™t able to because sh
e was standing in line day and night -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to get papers. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then, I don™t know if anybody told you, but sh
e had to walk out of the house with a pail 
and a brush in case they decided to ma ke her wa
sh the floors in Vienna. Not the floors, the -- 
Q: Streets. 

A: -- the street, you know. 

Q: And did she?  Do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
11 
 
A: I don™t know. 
Q: You don™t. 

A: She never told me . 

Q: She never told you. 

A: Never told me . 

Q: How did the -- your father is in Dachau -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- and then he™s -- 

A: Buchenwald. 

Q: -- and then Buchenwald. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And he™s there for about a year. 

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: So how are you surviving in this year?  
Ho -- who has mo ney and how do you get food? 
A: We ll, first of all, my father had his parent
s still alive, which, you know
, we were -- went there 
too, to see them, and they were, you know. And 
he had two brothers. Two brothers and two 
sisters. There were five of them
. So there was family on that side
. Only my mother™s side there 
wasn™t muc h fa mily. So, I don™t know. I don™t know. 
Q: You don™t know. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you see the f-family of your  father as well -- 

A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: -- together? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
12 
 
A: Sure, yeah. 
Q: So everybody -- you must have felt as a ch
ild, a -- a -- a lot of the nerves of everybody. 
Everybody must have been -- 

A: Yes, yes, and -- and yet, they were so trying to
 protect us that they di
dn™t tell us half of the 
things what was going on. You know, nowadays, say you 
have to be honest w
ith children, well, I 
guess they were brought up differently. 

Q: Right. 

A: Children -- like i-if some one died,the children never knew the person died. 

Q: They just went away. 

A: Just went away. I don™t know why, but that™s -- 

Q: Do you think that was a bad thing?  Do 
you think they should 
have told you more? 
A: No, I think I really appr
eciated that they di dn™t.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: I really did. 
Q: Right. 

A: I really did. And we left -- Mother got some  
papers, so -- for him to get out of the camp, but 
we were able to take him out, but if he woul
dn™t leave in 24 hours, Vienna, they take you back 
and that™s it, that -- you only had one chance. 
So thank God, she got papers, spend a lot of 
money, wha t ever she had on them, a nd they weren't worth anything. 

Q: The papers were not worth anything? 

A: Worth anything. And just on time , Italy opene
d up, all you needed was a passport, you could 
go to Italy, so -- which wa s a blessing, becau
se whatever she had, Uruguay, Paraguay, I don™t 
know where all the papers were, but
 you couldn™t travel with them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
13 
 
Q: You me a n, so she had papers fo
r him to go out of the country? 
A: Out of the country. 
Q: But those papers were worthless -- 

A: Worth --worthless. 

Q: -- she paid money for  nothing. 

A: Exactly. With a lot of harassment when -- wh
ile she was trying to ge
t them. And I know that 
was so sad, because some times she rushed to befirst, you know, to get there, and if you were 

first, then they put you at the end of the line.
 You know, they did -- tried anything to give you a 
hard time. So someti mes she came home crying. 

Q: Yeah. So that must have been very tough for you. 

A: So -- but she, you know, she did everything she 
could. So we got -- she got the passport from 

Papa, and then he didn™t have a picture, so qui
ckly when he gonna came out, he took a picture, 
and that™s all the passport needed. And you can see 
his face is swollen like that. They ga ve him 
certain things that swelled the pe
ople up, especially the ones that they
 let out, to show that he is -
- 

Q: That he™s okay. 

A: That he is okay. But it was not 
a healthy look he had, you know?  So -- 
Q: Did he -- did he return to Vi
enna before he went to Milan? 
A: Yes, he came -- 

Q: He did, so did you see him for that day? 

A: Yes, yes, oh yes. 

Q: Wa s that a great day for you? 

A: The best. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
14 
 
Q: It was the best. So you mi sse
d him a lot, didn™t you?  Yeah. 
A: I went to the -- to the sta --  train station to
 get him. And a lot of them were [indecipherable] 
right in, he wasn™t th
ere yet, but he came [indec i pherabl
e]. That was the best sight. 
Q: And -- and did you -- 
A: And then we had to tell him, you know, that he has to get out.  

Q: Right. 

A: So Milan, that was the closes
t, you know, to Italy that he could go. But we were so lucky that 
they let us in, just with the passport. And then 
he got there, and he -- I 
don™t know, he must have 
written, or I guess just a letter sa
ying that -- we said we would fo
llow him, your mother said that 
she would follow him with me  and my brother.And he wrote, don™t come  yet, because I cannot 

find work, and I don™t speak the language. O
bviously. And Mom wrote him back, don™t write 
any more. We™re comi ng this and this time, wait for 
us at the station, at th
e railroad station in 
Milan. And that™s what she did, a
nd that™s how she saved our life. 
Q: By not paying attention to him.  

A: See, he was still so stupid 
-- excuse me , Dad - -  after going 
through what he went through, he 
still didn™t believe that they would touch child
ren and old people. He di
dn™t believe that. Or 
wome n.  

Q: It was just the me n. 

A: He thought just the me n. And then he would l
eave us alone, but obviously, as we know later, 
they didn™t leave anybody alone. 

Q: Right. 

A: So he figured that we shoul
d stay safely at home , rather 
than going into the -- how would you 
say, into the world without knowing where we
™re going, okay?  But Mom was smart enough to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
15 
 
and we wanted to take, you know, the grandparents,
 to follow us even, and his brother. One got 
out to England, the youngest one
. The older one had a wife a
nd a baby, cutest baby. And no, he 
had -- she had a father, and he had the parents 
he wouldn™t leave, you kn
ow, and he still had a 
sister. They didn™t believe. 
Q: They didn™t believe. 

A: They didn™t believe, because 
they, you know, they took them all, 
after. I -- I finally went to 
Vienna, I made one trip to Vienna, after 35 year
s, 40 years, I™m not sure. And I asked if they 
know what happened to my fa mily, grandparents. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So then they wrote me with a list of what 
camp they were taken to. Camps that I never heard 
of. But they said there wa s nothing unusual 
because they had like 250 camps. You know, you 
only knew about the big ones -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- like Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and Be
rgen-Belsen, all those. 
But the little ones you 
didn™t know. 
Q: Yeah, there were hundreds of them. 

A: Hundreds of, yes. And they wrote me , you know, 
where they were killed, and wa -- they even 
had written down what day they wer -- died. They 
don™t say killed, the day they were died. Some  
of them I think they had wrong name s, but 
I had an idea of, you 
know, when it happened. 
Q: So, who did travel with you besides your -- yo
ur -- or you went, you -- they
 didn™t travel with 
you, but -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- you and your mother and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
16 
 
A: Ju -- and father -- 
Q: -- Heinz, your brother. 

A: -- and mother. 

Q: And your father™s already in Milan. 

A: In Milan, yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: And did your grandparents come , or not? 

A: No. 

Q: Nobody. Just -- just the three of -- 

A: Just the four of us. 

Q: The four of you together. 

A: Just the four of us. Nobody else
 ma de it out. Nobody else ma de it out. 
Q: And you took a train to
 Milan from Vienna? 

A: Yeah, we took a train. And we got very ne
rvous c-crossing, you know 
the -- the border, cause 
you never know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- what they™re gonna do with you. And the pa
ssport has a big J on it, so there was no -- you 
know, they™re asking me  always when there™s my
 name, mi ddle name, you have a mi ddle name?  
At that time they did not -- children did not 
get mi ddle name s like now. But Hitler gave us a 

mi ddle na me. 

Q: Yes, what was it? 

A: Sarah. Sarah, Sarah -- all the Jewish people we
re Sarah and the me n were Israel. Even in the 
passport it tells 
there, you know. 
Q: So did you have a passport? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
17 
 
A: Yeah. Well, on my mother™s passport. 
Q: On your mother™s passport? 

A: Yeah. Mine. 

Q: And Heinz was on the mother -- 

A: Heinz, too, yeah. 

Q: -- was on the mother™s passport. 

A: Mother™s passport, three of
 us on one passport, mm-hm.  
Q: Was your mother able to 
take out any money, do you know? 
A: Not much. 

Q: Not much. 

A: We didn™t have much. 

Q: Right. 

A: And we were afraid to take any posse
ssions because we didn™t trust them, you know -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- [indecipherable] in the border. So we just
 took like we were -- we 
wanted to take -- the 
warm blankets like they had in Austri -- 

Q: A quilt? 

A: A quilt, a [i ndeciphera ble] 

Q: A down?  

A: A down. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
18 
 
A: You know, we all had down, and Mother wanted 
to take for us. And then my brother says, 
don™t take it, don™t take it. He was afraid, you know. 
So then later, while we still were able to 
converse with them in Vienna, my aunt
 decided she™s gonna s-send one to us. 
Q: You -- 
A: Never got that. 

Q: -- never got that. 

A: Never got that. But I know she did. 
And none of the jewelry or anything. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We didn™t take anything. My mot her™s, you 
know, just wedding ring. I had a charm bracelet, 
you know, which I was so fond of, bu
t we had a feeling like ma ybe 
my aunt put it in the quilt, 
because she knew that I liked it. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But ma ybe that™s when they found 
that, they just took everything away. 
Q: Right. 

A: You just never knew what they 
were -- and I forgot to tell 
you that in the morning they came 
to pick up my father. If he wasn™t gone -- 

Q: They would have picked him up. 

A: They would have picked him up, yeah. They 
would have taken him. W- We could hear it on 
the steps, too, you know, they were -- 

Q: The boots?  The shoes? 

A: Yeah, the boots, comi ng up the steps a
nd knocking on the door lik
e crazy. And my poor 
grandmother was so, you know, scared. But -- 

Q: So they came  to your grandmother™s house? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498

A: They came  to my gr andmother™s house, b
ecause Mother, you know, was with us more than 
she was -- she gave up the apartment. 
Q: I see. 

A: But what™s the use, you know, to pay 
rent there, and you know, not be there.  
Q: Right. 

A: So, she was wi -- 

Q: Did you wear a j -- have 
to wear a Jewish star? 
A: No. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: No. And -- 

Q: Did your mother? 

A: No.  

Q: No. 
A: Her sign was the pail. The pail and the brush. 
Q: And her passport. 

A: And her pa -- she didn
™t have a passport then. 

Q: She only had the passport when you were leaving? 

A: For Papa, yeah. For Father
. That was the important one. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah, that he got away. 

Q: When you were on the train, 
do you reme mbe r  feeling scared? 
A: Yes. Til we crossed the border [indecipherable]
 to border. One of the -- one of the borders 
which was very tense. When they come  in -- th
ey really scare you when they walk in, you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
20 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: They were so scary looking. We ll, they let us
 go, and that™s the ma in thing. My brother, I 
think, was more scared than me , even. Maybe caus
e he was older, he was smarter to be scared 
than me . So he was really nervous when they got -- 

Q: Were you in a comp artment in the train? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Alone?  Or were ther
e other people there? 

A: No, other people. 

Q: There were other people? 

A: Other people, yeah, other people. 

Q: Do you know if they were Jewish
 and they were trying to escape? 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: You have no idea. 
A: I didn™t -- 
Q: So there was no  

A: Maybe they knew, but they 
didn™t -- Mother didn™t tell me . 

Q: They didn™t tell you. 

A: No. 

Q: We re you holding onto your mother a lot? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. I was just sit
ting scared, too scared. 
Q: Did you feel, at that age,
 closer to your father than
 your mo ther, in some way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
21 
 
A: I felt closer -- no, I felt pretty protected by 
Mom, but I felt closer to
 Dad, because they took 
him.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know?  I was worried about him.  

Q: Right. 

A: So -- 

Q: So you had a lot of protective instincts, didn™
t you, as a kid?  Interestin
g at such a young age, 
to be like that. 

A: I worried about him. Whew. But thank God -- 

Q: He was okay. 

A: -- he came out. There was -- and y
ou know, my father never talked about. 
Q: Never?  Did you want him to? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: I didn™t really want him to, not at that young 
age. Maybe later on I would have liked to know 
certain things. But I tell you why he didn™t. He 
felt insulted by the situation, you know?  He felt 
so degraded. He didn™t think that he
 was deserving of such a thing. 
Q: Right. 

A: So he didn™t want to talk 
about it, no. Wa s strange, but he 
never talked about it. The only 
thing is, you know, whe n they -- in the street 
when they were walking, and they me t some one 

from -- they used to say K. Z., K. Z. lager, 
and they knew each other, 
and then they called my 
father™s name, it was like this, you know, he was ju
mping. So it was always a hard thing when he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
22 
 
-- when he met someone in the st
reet and they called his name, he
 was like an attention. And was 
so sad to see that. 
Q: And this was happening in Italy? 

A: It was happening in Italy. 

Q: We  have to stop the tape.

other study a little bit 
of Italian before you

A: No, no. 

Q: No. How long -- 
A: We didn™t have time. 
Q: Do you have any idea how long it was between 
when your father got there, and when you got 
there? 

A: I would say ma ybe a couple of weeks. 

Q: That™s all? 

A: Yes, we rushed. I think. It mi
ght have been longer, I don™t know. 

Q: Right. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: So you think you got there 1939? 

A: 1939 -- end of ™39, I guess. I have to look it up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
24 
 
Q: You have to look. 
A: I™m not sure. Let me  see. I don™t even know if 
it says here. Think there were some  dates here. 
There™s -- ma ybe here. Okay. 1930 -- 1940 was already. 

Q: 1940?  So it was after the war st
arted?  After the 
attack on Poland. 
A: Escape from Vienna. Yeah, must -- mu
st have been the end of 1939, ™40.  
Q: ™40, something like that. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. So where did you live when you were -- after you we -- 

A: We ll, he had an apartment.  

Q: He did? 

A: Yeah, with one -- one room, you know, just 
one room. And I don™t have a big me mo ry of 
Milan at all. 

Q: We re you there for very -- you we ren™t there for very long, were you? 
A: I don™t think very long, no. But a 
few weeks, quite a few weeks.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: But I don™t have a very good me mory of that.I reme mber being there, not knowing -- and I 

reme mber comi ng down stair -- step
s, and whoever was there, the landlady or whatever you call 
her, tried to teach me  to say, you know, good 
mor ning, good evening. And then I tried to 
reme mber which was mo rning, which was evening, you know. That was kind of hard, you know, 

to learn all of a sudden, a language.  

Q: So what™s good morning in Italian? 

A: Buon giorno. 

Q: And wha t ™s good evening? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
25 
 
A: Buona sera. 
Q: So you eventually learned, didn™t you? 

A: Yes, I did learn. 
My favorite language. 
Q: Is it? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: It™s a beautiful language. 

A: Yes, I think so.  

Q: Your father didn™t have work when you were there? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: How did he get an apartment, do you know? 

A: I guess with the little mone
y that he took with him, you know. But then we had to leave 
Milan, then some one talked us into going to Fran
ce, that we could be saved in France. So we 
went to Italian city, Ventimiglia, which was on the border of so me place. And over there there 

were people that were leader
s, to take you over to France,
 through mountains and woods, you 
know?  But they needed money, you know, they 
wanted money, they did it for money. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we stayed there for awhile, and waited for 
the right people to come  to take us. And some  
people came back. I remember that so clearly, th
ey couldn™t get them across. And here come s 
this young woma n, we were sitti
ng and having lunch. We  had like, I reme mber, a lunch -- you 
know, lunch is the big meal in Europe, just on
e, either one mi nestr -- mi nestrone, you know, the 
vegetable soup. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
26 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Which filled you up and it was good. And that™s 
all we coul d afford, you know, just have this 
plate of soup, or -- I didn™t get used 
to spaghettis yet, 
you know, I didn™t -- 
Q: You didn™t? 

A: No, I didn™t. I couldn™t eat 
the spaghettis. The only one between
 the four of us, my mom. She 
liked them right away. But we didn™t, so we had 
the soup. And we™re sitting in the restaurant, and 
he -- here come s this young woma n, s c ratched from 
top to bottom, just scratches on her. And she 
stands by the door, like out of her mind, and she 
pees in front of everybody, just standing there 
on the door. She lost her mi nd. She a bsolutely 
lost her mi nd trying to get up, you know, the 
mountains, and they had so ma ny thorns there that
 wherever they were 
going, it just scratched 
the hell out of her, you know?  And mu -- she must
 have gone through such 
a terrible thing that 
she just didn™t know what she was doing. She wa
s crying, just crying. And I told my parents, 

ﬁ We have to go through that?  That™s terrible.ﬂ So
 Mother said, ﬁYeah, but we already gave them 
all our mone y, you know, we have to go. We  don™t 
have anything left.ﬂ But then some  word 
came that it™s over. They™re not going any more 
to France. So we didn™t have money, we didn™t 
have a ride, we didn™t have anything.
 So we went to the -- to the st
ation, to the railroad station to 
get out of Ventimiglia. And somehow, I guess -- 
I don™t know if the Jewish emi -- Jewish people 
helped, or who helped, I don™t know. But they got 
us -- we were able to get on the train to 
Genoa, okay?  So we got on the tr
ain -- we got on the train and my
 dad, he is -- was such a good 
person, he wa s the leader. He had a little more, 
you know, brain than some  of the people, so he 
was the leader and he got everybody on 
the train, and he was left behind.  
Q: You were on the train, and he was not on the train? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
27 
 
A: Do you I have to tell you more?  Did this get 
-- did I get hysteric --
 you darn right I got 
hysterical. And they had soldiers on the train, th
ey were all trying to comf ort me , I don™t know -- 
didn™t understand what they were saying to me
, you know. But I know they were nice to me . 
You know, the Italian? And they 
tried to calm me  down. And 
the -- I don™t know what you call 
the guy that was running -- not runni
ng the train, but the people that
 are on the train, don™t worry, 
don™t worry, because next  stop -- he tried to e
xplain to me  the next stop, they gonna put him on 
the next train and we just have to wait. Bu
t that was 100 years we waited. You know?  We  had 
just gotten him, and now to lo
st hi m again, it
 was horrible. 
Q: So did they hold your train?  They would -- 
A: No, they -- we -- we got to Geno
a and just waited at the station -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- for the next train. 

Q: The next train. 
A: Til he finally got out. 
Q: Got out. 

A: So then, we were in Genoa, wher
e do we go?  You know, what do we do?   
Q: Right. 

A: So there was a piazza, you know, in Italy, they
 have a lot of piazzas, and there was a piazza 
Christopher Columbus. And that™s 
where we wanted to go because we felt closer to America, 
being -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- Columbus was there. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
28 
 
A: So we went on that pi azza. 
Q: Now this is after your dad come s? 

A: After my  dad, sure -- 

Q: You wait --  

A: -- we waited  

Q: -- you™re waiting for him.  

A: -- oh yeah -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- oh yeah. And then we needed some thing, 
we hadn™t eaten a long time, too, and they had 
like milk, you know, they sell milk, warm milk i n 
Italy, big -- big cups, like a bowl more. And 
we had some of that with some  bread in that , you know, which was any thing inexpensive that 

we could get. And so we had a bite of that, wh
at did we do now?  So then the Italian governme nt 

gave us a subsidy. 
Q: Really? 
A: They did, yes, they did give us some
 money. I don™t know exactly how ma ny liras, but it 
helped -- helped us, you know?  And then we got into 
an apartment. They help
ed us to get into an 
apartment. I am saying apartment, I™m -- it™s a 
room, we got a room with pens -- a penzione. 
Penzione. Fact, I got some  pictures from that
, too. And -- and we got one big room, and it was 

like below the level of the street
, but we didn™t care, you know, as 
long as we were together, and 
-- in fact, we snuck in some  people that were
, you know, needy, didn™t know where to go, so we 
-- they slept with us on the floor, whatever. We  
s nuck them in at night. I reme mber that. Of 
course, Mother never told us that we were sneak
ing them in, but I think 
we were smart enough to 
know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
29 
 
Q: Right. 
A: They didn™t pay us, you know, they didn™t -- 

Q: Did this room have furniture? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: It did? 

A: It had beds, and closet, and -- 

Q: Now, ho-how were you and your 
brother -- are you 
just good kids? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: You know that the situation -- 

A: Yeah, oh yeah. We  were good kids, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: They never had trouble with us, no.  

Q: Unless you got separated. 
A: We  never wanted to get separated -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- no, we stuck together like
 glue. So -- and then -- then 
came  the order. I don™t know why, 
that we had to leave Genoa, but the me n had to
 be separated from the wome n and children. 
Q: Let me  a sk you some thing before we go to
 that. How -- about how long are you in Genoa? 
A: I would say -- 

Q: Is it a few months?  You could check.  

A: We ll, actually, my brother was Ba r Mitzvah™d in Genoa. 

Q: He was? 

A: He was. He was 13 then. He was barmit -- okay, let™s see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
30 
 
Q: You™re eight or nine years old -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Right?  

A: Eight or nine. 

Q: So he™s 13. 

A: Yeah, he™s 13, and I is -- again skipped so
me thing. While we were in Genoa, the Jewish 
community sent the children -- the Jewi -- It alia
n people were taking in children to feed them 
lunch, you know, lunch is the big meal. They were
 giving us lunch. But I -- to this day I don™t 
understand why they separated my br
other and I. I went to one fa m
ily and he went to a different 
fa mily to eat lunch. And it was very scary beca
use there were already 
sirens going on, you know, 
the war was already beginning, or I 
don™t know what it was, but I ha
d to walk quite a way to get 
to this -- was a woman that was -- her name wa
s Celestina Weiss. And I reme mber her name . 
Q: Celestina We iss. 
A: Celestina We iss. And she prepared lunch for 
-- not she, she had a -- a woma n there who was 
cooking lunch for us, just the two of us. 

Q: Just the two of you?  

A: Just the two of -- 

Q: You were the only kid? 

A: Yeah. Why couldn™t my brot
her be there with me , you know?  So we would have walked 
together, I wouldn™t have to be so scared to wa
lk by myself when the si rens came, and then the 
ha -- in Genoa they have large tunnels. So I rush
ed like crazy into the t
unnel, cause that was like 
protection from the bombs. 

Q: Was their air raids? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
31 
 
A: Air raid -- 
Q: There were air ra
ids, weren™t there? 
A: Air raids, yeah. And you know, nobody would le
t you in once the air raids, so I™m running 
into those tunnels like crazy, til it™s over
. But I™m by myself, I™m a little kid by myself, you 
know?   

Q: So how come  your mother or your fa
ther didn™t walk with you, do you think? 
A: They were not supposed to. 

Q: They weren™t supposed to. 

A: No. I came -- I think when I -- they had a little
 bit of schooling at the synagogue in Genoa, so 
from the school I had to go to the -- to it. And 
that there was so much left over, and I was 

thinking, why don™t she give it to me  for my pa
rents, but you know, I -- I was -- I couldn™t -- you 
know, I was not brought up that
 way, to say anything. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: I was just thankful for the meal. And my br
other went to a different
 family, who was also 
very nice to him, but only him. And then wh
en the Bar Mitzva h was, we went all to the 
synagogue there, and this fa mily that was feedi
ng my brother, they send us to -- they ma de 
reservations in a restau
rant to -- you know, to cel
ebrate his Ba r Mitzvah. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: You know they -- nobody came with us, just f
our of us. Now I™m thinking why?  Why would 
not one of the parents, or
 -- I don™t understand that. 
Q: You me a n no -- the -- one of -- th
e -- the parents where he was going -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- didn™t come ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
32 
 
A: No. 
Q: Just you -- 

A: They ma de reservation for the four of us to
 eat in a rest aurant t
ogether, finally we were 
together in the meal. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: You know, I -- 

Q: But nobody else. 

A: But nobody else. Can you figure that one out? No. 
But that was war, I guess, and people were 
strange. 

Q: Now the woma n whe r e you were
 eating lunch, did you -- did sh
e talk with you?  Di -- was it 
nice -- 

A: Yeah, she was nice. 

Q: -- she was a nice person? 
A: Very nice. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Very nice. 

Q: And a lot of fa milies were doing this for the Je wish -- 

A: And you could see the 
richness in her house. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know?  I think where my brother was goin
g, there were younger people, because they had 
children and this woma n was -- right now, a -- a --
 she doesn™t s-sound like she was that old, but 
you know, at the time, when you™re eight or nine
, you would think she is -- ma ybe she was 50, 
and I thought she was 95, you know, I don™t know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
33 
 
Q: How quickly did you learn to speak Italian? 
A: I would say within a year [indecipherable] 

Q: Yes, so by -- by now in Genoa, you™re pretty good. 

A: I was already -- I was doing pretty good, not
 -- not as good as I wanted to, but -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I™m -- I was getting along, okay? 

Q: Now, do you -- you are Jews
 in a Fascist country. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And they do now -- by the time  you™re there,
 they have anti-Semitic laws. Are you feeling 

anything against you as Jews? 

A: No. 

Q: You™re not. 

A: No, not at all. 
Q: Not at all. 
A: Not at all. 

Q: So you fe el safe there, in some  wa y. 

A: I -- I feel safe, yes. Til the order did come
 to separate us again. That was very bad. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: As you can imagine. 

Q: And l-let™s -- before we do that one, w-we 
-- you are going to s -- to some  sort of a school, 
every day? 

A: Yeah, it™s a -- 

Q: Jewish school. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498

A: -- Jewish school, at the synagogue. 
Q: And are you learni ng academic subjects as well as religion or not?  Do you reme mber? 

A: I think it™s subjects
 besides religion, yes. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yes, they were trying to teach us, I gue

Q: Did you have homework? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t -- 

A: I don™t reme mber home work. 

Q: You don™t reme mber homework? 

A: No. Don™t reme mber home work. 

Q: Do you reme mber teachers? 

A: I don™t -- I know they 
were there, but I -- 
Q: But you don™t reme mber them?  

A: Not reme mber them.  

Q: Now, in Genoa, are you living in the same  place the whole time? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: That ba -- that sort of baseme nt -- 

A: Yeah, yes. 

Q: -- apartment. 

A: Right. 

Q: Is your father working? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
35 
 
Q: No. 
A: He couldn™t get work. 

Q: So you™re living on the subsidy. 

A: We ™re living on subsidy. 

Q: Which can™t be very much. 

A: No. Just enough to exist, you know? 

Q: Now, are you hearing rumors about the war in 
the rest of Europe?  I mean, you, as a kid you -- 
A: Well, you hear war because of the sirens, you know -- you know, and bom -- they were 

bombarding already.  

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: There were bombardme nts. So, but you don™
t really know what goes on here, you know? 

Q: So you don™t hear your parents 
talking, and -- and you don™t know -- 
A: No. 
Q: Do you ask about your relatives in Vienna
, what™s happening to Grandpa and Grandma? 
A: Yeah, I ask, but they didn™t know. I think my 
uncle was one that was -- w-was the last one 
that wrot e. Th -- that ™s my father™s brother. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He went to see my other grandparents, in my mother™s side. 

Q: Right. 

A: And he was giving us report, you know, that -- th
ere™s certain toys that 
we had there, that he 
want my -- my grandfather wouldn™t give it away
 for anything. He had like a stepstool, and my 
brother put nails in it with his 
initials, see?  So my uncle wanted
 it for his son. And says, I give 
you everything, but I won™t give you this away. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
36 
 
Q: Wo w. 
A: Who knows who -- who got ahold of that -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you know?  But one thing my grandfather did,I had a big book of -- of fairy tales, Grimm -- 

Grimm fairy tales. Wa s this thick, you know, all th
e fairy tales, and I l
oved that book. I loved to 
listen to the stories all the time,
 and try to read them myself, 
too. And Mother said no way can 
you take that book. And my grandfather, when
 we got to -- to Italy, there it was. 
Q: Really? 

A: He snuck it into the suitcase? 

Q: Your father did? 

A: My grandfather. 

Q: No, your grandfather. Pu

A: One of the suitcases, there it was. Course
, we had to get rid of it on the way, you know, the 
running we had to do, but -- 

Q: But you had it for a certain period of time. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So, were you able to read it by then? 

A: Yes, I was able to read it -- 

Q: Yes, you could, yeah. 

A: -- yes, sure. I was reading pretty early, yeah. 
Then I turned dumb later, but I was smart as a 
kid. 

Q: I -- I doubt -- I doubt that. So, 
y-you now get some  news, right, that you have to leave Genoa. 
Now, you know who™s gi -- who™s saying that 
you have to leave?  Is it the governme nt?

A: We ll -- some thing with the governme nt, I don™t 
know exactly who is at fault doing that. And 
the way they send us wherever they wanted t
o. But why did they separate us, we don™t know. 
That was such a mystery. There was one more wo
ma n with two children, and Mother with two 
children. And I know we moved in
 together in a -- they ha
d a bigger house, you know, so we 
were able to live together . And -- and that was in
 Potenza. The name  of the town was Viggiano.

A: I don™t reme mber that. So that™s where we went. I know we had to go down -- you know, the 

towns in Italy are all up. You had to go up and 
then come  down. Everything was hilly, and -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- you know. And we had to go to re
gister with the police every day. 
Q: Every day? 

A: Every day, that we didn™t escape, or I don™
t know where they -- wh
at they thought. I don™t 
know why. But that™s how we got our subsidy, too, I think. 

Q: By seeing the police. 
A: By seeing the police. 
Q: Now, is your father separated from you now?  

A: Yes.

A: Tortoreto, yeah. So he was there, and then we
 were able to write to
 each other. They didn™t 
have cell phones then. 
Q: No. 

A: Couldn™t call. And then they 
-- I don™t know if it was Tortoret
o, Camp ania. He went two pla -
- he went two pla -- di fferent pl aces. 

Q: And were these camps? 

A: No. 

Q: No. This was just an -- a city, a town. 

A: City -- a town, yeah. And then what we did is 
we ma de a request that 
maybe he could come to 
us, or we could come  to him so we™re together. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, it was so hard to be apart. So they
 send us together to a camp in Italy. It was 

called Ferramonti. You heard of it, I™m sure. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Ferramonti di Tarsia. 
A: Yeah, di Tarsia. So they send us there instead
 of -- nice place, you know,li -- to be free. So -- 
Q: And Ferramonti is in the south. 

A: In the south yes.  

Q: And is it -- 

A: Very hot. 

Q: Very hot. 

A: Hot during the day, lot of ma la

Q: And how did you all get there?  
By train again?  Do you reme mber? 
A: Maybe by truck?  By truck --
 truck?  Maybe trucks, or buses. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Something like that, I don™t know. 

Q: Do you go by yourselves?  I mean, they say you™re 
going to be there, or do they -- the soldiers 
don™t pick you up and take you? 

A: No, we just go -- 

Q: This is sort of a free -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- a free thi -- I mean, you™re going by yourselves to -- 

A: I think so. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- and when we got there, to f -- Ferramon
ti, it was so quiet ther
e. It was the time  for 
when they were counting, you know the people, li
ke the soldiers were, they -- they had a -- 
appelle. 

Q: Appelle, right. 

A: Appelle, yeah. So nobody was in the street. A
nd my brother didn™t want to go in. There™s 
barbed wire all around, he was afra
id to go in. He says, that™s 
it, the end for us, you know?  So I 
said, and Mother too, Papa™s here, we have to go 
in, we cannot leave him. The police had to get -

- 

Q: The police had to get him?  Because he wouldn™t go? 

A: Wouldn™t go in. My brave br
other wouldn™t go in. So, poor guy. 
He says if there™s barbed 
wire, and soldiers, it™s not a good sign. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
41 
 
Q: We ll, he has a good instinct, didn™t he?   
A: Absolutely. 

Q: Yes. Now you are 10 or 11 year old now. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your brother is 14? 

A: 14, yeah, must be 14. 

Q: Must be 14. 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. At least 14 going on 15, I guess. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So we get there, and like I say, it™s quiet
, and there™s a guy going ar
ound us like a nut, like 
this, around and, ﬁHaben sie die Basel, Habe
n sie die Basel, Ha ben sie die Basel.ﬂ 
Q: What is that? 

A: You know, constantly is asking us for a paper, a newspaper, Basel. 

Q: From Ba sel. 

A: You know the -- everybody™s hungry for news. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know. 

Q: But this guy was afraid to ask, I guess. I 
couldn™t understand why he was going around us like 
crazy. ﬁHaben sie di e Basel, Haben sie die Base
l, Haben sie die Basel.ﬂ And he scared me  
almost. 

Q: I can imagine. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
42 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: But he kept circling where you were? 

A: He kept circling the three of us, you know, because they we re just comi ng out of the barracks 

at that time , and so he wanted some  news, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- poor ma n. 

Q: Right. 

A: But finally my dad came out, so that was 
again a good thing. We  didn™t feel so abandoned 
when he came . 

Q: When he came out. 

A: Yes. He was a little ma n, but strong. 

Q: He was strong. Okay, we™ll stop.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Evelyn, you™ve me ntioned your grandparents a lot. Can you give us their name s before we go 
on with the story? 

A: Yeah. On my mother™s side, my grandfathe
r™s name  was Marcus, and my grandmother was 
Rose. And their last name
 was Leer, L double e - r. 
Q: L double e - r? 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. I see in my papers th
at nobody really knew -- some  are L-e-h-r -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and some  are L double e - r. So
 I™m sticking with double e - r -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- because I think that™s th
e last papers I saw, yes. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then -- 
Q: So those were your -- that™s 
-- were your mother™s parents -- 
A: Mother™s side -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- and her sister, one sister
. Her name  was Haran -- Aranka. 
Q: Aranka. 

A: Yeah -- for Hungarian, th
 -- they were Hungarian. 
Q: So your pa -- your mother™s fami ly came from Hungary? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But she was already born in Vienna. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
44 
 
Q: I see. 
A: My mother -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and her sist er -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- both. But I think my grandparents were born in Hungary. 

Q: Uh-huh. And your father™s -- 

A: Father™s? My grandfather™s name  was He
noch, H-e-n-o-c-h, and my gr andmother was Toby. 

Q: Toby?  

A: Toby. 

Q: Hm. 

A: But they called her Toni. 

Q: They called her Toni? 
A: Toni, because Toby is too Jewish, it was too 
Jewish, so they tried to -- Vienna, you know, you 
had to watch your name , your language. See, there 
was never a Jewish word spoken in the house, 
because when they went into the workforce, they
 didn™t want  the children to say Jewish words, 
because they were right away discrimi nated agai
nst. So they were very careful with Je wish 
words. 
Q: Does that mean that you were 
not very Jewish id
entified, or -- 
A: No -- 

Q: -- when in -- in Vienna? 

A: We  were Jewish, definitely, but we  tried 
to live in a non-Jewish world. They were so 
prejudice that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
45 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- we -- we -- not talking about me  --  

Q: Right. 

A: I™m talking about my  pa
rents and grandparents -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- they had to watch, cause -- 

Q: And -- 

A: -- you know, one night they ca n take away your -- your job. 

Q: And this is before Hitler? This is
 before the Ge rmans come in again. 
A: Yeah, before even, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You had to be careful. 

Q: So was it very different for you in Italy, in 
term -- could you feel it 
being different in your 
fa mily? 

A: In Italy, let™s see, in Genoa, no, I felt -- ex
cept that, you know, the di
visions, and I was very 
upset. I never complained about it, I never spoke 
about it, but thinking back, I know that I was so 
upset that we  had food, and not that my parent
s were starving, but th
ey had to, you know, hold 
back. So I couldn™t -- now, I cannot understand 
why. There was so muc h food these people had, 
and they were rich, why couldn™t they feed a fa m
ily, or keep two kids together?  I couldn™t -- I 
don™t know. 

Q: So th -- so the -- the Jewish Ital ian fa milies took in kids -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- but not adults? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
46 
 
A: Not adults, just -- 
Q: So, do you know wha t  your parents did for lunch? 

A: Well, they had some. 

Q: They had some. 

A: They were not, you know, that -- you 
know, they -- simple things, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- maybe a sandwich, or Mom -- Mother made maybe some soup, or -- you know, something. 

I don™t think they were starving at that time, but it would have been nice if, you know, they could 

have had better -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I would have been happier. 

Q: Right. What was supper like?  Did 
you have supper together as a family? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And was that just a very light  meal? 
A: Yeah, light meal. Light meal. Of course, 
children get more hungry th
an adults too, you know? 
Q: Yes, right. 

A: We  were so hungry. 

Q: It was tough. 

A: Yeah, it was tough when you™re hungry. And I ju
st feel for people that are hungry. I can feel 
the pain, the hunger, you know, that I went 
through. It™s not good. Not a good thing. And you 
don™t know what™s going to be -- I reme mber -- well,
 that™s later. I don™t want to get ahead of 
myself. 

Q: We ll, you can, so you don™t forget. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
47 
 
A: No, I won™t forget. 
Q: You won ™ t forget. 

A: When we  get to the next town, in Ferramonti? 

Q: Yes? 

A: We  lived in barracks, one room, 
you know, four of us in one room. 
Q: The four of you were in one room? 

A: Small, small, very small room. And I think 
outside the barracks there was like toilet -- I can™t 
reme mber where the toilets were. I don™t rememb
er bath -- baths. I think we just washed 

ourselves in -- 

Q: The sink? 

A: -- sink -- no, we didn™t have a si
nk [indecipherable] you know, in -- 
Q: What, like a bowl? 

A: Bowl, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Purposely ma de for [indecipherable] I -- I do
n™t reme mbe r  baths there. There mi ght have 
been, but my me mory™s not there. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my mother was so busy feeding us that
 her stomach sank. Do you ever hear of that? 

Q: No, what does that mean? 

A: By her not eating, her stomach sank and she kept on fainting. You know, she walked, and she 

fainted, and she walked and she fainted. So the 
camp allowed us children to go outside the camp, 

or ma -- or the police, the milizia was there, the 
soldiers, they had booths in front of the camp in 
a few places. And they could sell you some  th -- God bless the Italians, they could -- she needed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
48 
 
a lot of vitami ns, like lemons, oranges, so we 
bought from them that stuff. And then once in 
awhile we were able to go to one of the farm
s to bring for Mom some 
stuff that she needed, you 
know?  They didn™t have vitami ns like we have no
w to get her back on -- her health back. She 
was just so sick, and I had to do, you know, all 
the labor. The washing -- and washing was not 
easy because no running water, obviously and so we carried water into the house, and then we 
had to wash and then carry it out. And of course
, you didn™t have that muc h clothes that you have 

now, so you had to be careful, you know, what you did, and I had a father and a brother, and -- 

you know, and I was very -- 

Q: So you™re doing the laundry for everybody? 

A: I was doing the laundry. 

Q: All by hand? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Where would you hang the clothes?   
A: I think I had out -- it dried 
in a mi nute because it was so hot. It was so hot, you coul dn™t go 
out during the day. And we always got 
a lot of -- and at 
night it was cold. 
Q: Really? 
A: So there was malaria, s -- 
that™s how you get the ma laria. 
Q: Hm. 

A: And they were so sick, people. So the governme nt gave us shots for anti -- and then we used 

to eat quinine -- quinine, a lot ev
ery day we had to take quinine. But on top of it we got shots for 
typhus and stuff like that. 

Q: So this is a camp run by the Italians -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
49 
 
Q: -- not the Germans? 
A: Not the German, the Italian. 

Q: So it was nice, in comparison with
 what you think it mi ght have been? 
A: In compa r ison to German, oh yes. But you still
 were restricted, and I think they had a me ss 
hall, if I™m not mi staken. 

Q: And that™s where you ate? 

A: I think they did have a me ss hall. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  the food? 

A: No. 

Q: No. You don™t reme mber eating -- 

A: I don™t reme mber the food. 

Q: -- pasta? 

A: No. 
Q: Did you like pasta by then? 
A: Mm- mm.  

Q: You still didn™t like it?  That™s too bad. 

A: Give it to me now. 

Q: Now you  like it? 

A: Yes, I li -- I like it a lot. But -- but we ate 
there, I think they had so mu ch food, and then we 
kind of got, would you say chummy, or -- the camp di
rector, he had the little girl about my age, 
so I was friendly with her, and -- 
I™m moving things. And he gave us a little bit more privileges, 
the father, you know, the camp director, very nice 
ma n. But i n that way my mother slowly gave 
away everything I owned to that little girl. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
50 
 
Q: Really? 
A: I had one do -- one doll that I 
took from Vienna. My very favorite I couldn™t take with me . 
This was like a soft doll, and her name  was Muschi. 

Q: Muschi. 

A: Muschi was a certain name  this doll had. So 
my mother ha -- gave it to her, you know, cause 
she liked the doll, and that™s a wa
r, you have to do that. And a lot of my c l othes, which was okay, 
because I grew out of them, you know, and she 
was a little smaller. And they were all like 
custom made, you know, from Vienna. 

Q: Right. 

A: And my dad working in the factory where fabric
s were, fr om a little sample I was able to have 
a dress because I was a little 
kid. So that™s how we, you know, we paid our way and the -- you 
know, you go through things that you have to do. 

Q: Did that aggravate you? 
A: I don™t know. I think losing the 
doll was I think worse than my clothes. Really was, the doll. 
And I lost my book, couldn™t have the book to sc
hlep with me , you know, was too heavy and -- 
you know, I understood and I didn™t understand, you 
know?  I understood that 
I couldn™t, but I 
wish I could have, and you know. 
Q: So in some  way you lost your childhood? 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I did, yeah. And in Kansas City they cam
e to interview me. You know, we have a book, I 
don™t know if you are familiar with the book, which 
the Kansas City Star did. And this woma n 
that came  to interview me only wanted to know 
wa -- how was it before a -- when I was a child. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
51 
 
How was it then?  I couldn™t tell her very much. I 
tried to tell her, I wa
s not a child, you know, I 
grew up too fast. She didn™t get it, you know. So -- 
I mean, I told her, and I got away a little bit 
from it, but I never was able to really e
xpress the way wi -- things really were.  
Q: Right. 
A: But that™s okay. 

Q: It™s as if pieces of your childhood -- 

A: Yeah, I -- 

Q: -- were taken away from you -- 

A: -- yes -- 

Q: -- in various stages. 

A: -- taken away.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I never was a child again. 
Q: When you played with this li
ttle girl, did she allow you to play
 with the doll?  Did she realize 
that she was getting your doll? 
A: I don™t know -- 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: I don™t think so. I don™t know whether sh
e did or not. She liked the doll, and -- 
Q: And that was it. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you think were only Jews in this camp, 
or was it -- there were people who were not 
Jewish?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
52 
 
A: There were peo -- people ma rried to non-
Jews, you know, that stuck with their husbands, 
some  wome n do stick with their Jewish husband. 
Q: Right. And they put them in --  

A: Some  people don™t, yes, and they were there 
with them. In fact, we had next door to us a 
couple that was -- he was Jewish, she was not. Bu
t they loved each other 
a lot and -- cause they 
were together. And then they sepa
rated them, we heard later. And they told him that they killed 
her, and she wasn™t any more alive. Well, he we
nt out of his mi nd, this poor ma n killed himself. 
And it wasn™t true. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: So you know, tragedies like that happen. They 
were such a nice couple. I just loved them. 
And they had a lot of -- in Ferramonti they had a 
lot of wild dogs. See, the dogs came , and it was 
so hot that they were a little wild, cause th
e heat and no food. And they came , and this couple 
were hiding a dog that they got at
tached to. But then came the orde
r that all the dogs had to be 
killed. And I reme mber them sitting and just
 crying, you know. And still 
holding on and thinking 
another day, another day. They tried to keep th
at dog just as long as they could. But then they 
were searching room by room, you know, for the dog, because they said the dogs got ma d, you 

know, like from the heat, and from -- by the hundreds
 they came  to Ferramonti, because we were 
-- we were feeding them, I guess, and they came, 
but not enough, so they -- they were dangerous, 
they said. So you could just 
hear fire them -- firing.  
Q: Mm. 

A: And I felt so bad for them, you know. 

Q: Did you -- 

A: Especially people I --
 we didn™t get any dog, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
53 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Right now I would, but
 at that time, no. And I felt so bad for them. 
Q: We re you friendly with any of the dogs, 
even though you didn™t have one?  Did you -- 
A: I was friendly with the dog next door -- 

Q: Next door. 

A: -- you know, with these people. But I was a little
 bit afraid, to be trut
hful, cause he was quite 
a big dog, and -- 

Q: Really? 

A: -- and they were scaring us what the dog 
is gonna do, and you know, that they can bite you 
and attack you, and -- I didn™t 
see any dog doing that, but -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- they could have, you know?  W- We got a lo
t of injections. And another thing where my 
brother didn™t want
 any inject -- 
Q: He didn™t -- he didn™t 
want injections either? 
A: Here comes the police agai
n, to get him to the doctor. 

Q: But it™s interesting that th
e government was doing that, even 
though they were keeping you in 
a camp, isn™t it? 

A: Yes, yes. They were very nice to -- to do 
that. And I think that wa
s -- and later on, you know, 
the typhus wa s really rampant. 

Q: Right. 

A: So with those shots, we were -- 

Q: You were protected. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
54 
 
A: Yes, we were protected, we didn™t even know
 how much, when we mo
ved out of the camp. 
There were a lot of doctors in that cam
p. Like -- I understand like over 200 doctors. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes. Lot of doctors. And they were looking 
for work, they were so bored. So one day I™m 
carrying a -- a jug with water, and that was,
 you know, a jug from [indecipherable] you know, 
like -- 

Q: Cerami c? 

A: -- would be ma  -- ceramic, kind of. And so
me how The jug hit my hand, and I was bleeding, 
you know, I hit the vein just there. And I wa
s ble -- you should have seen, a hundred came  
running. They were so happy some body was bleeding. 

Q: So they could do something. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did they have a school for kids? 
A: They had a school. In fact, I 
have one picture left from that
 camp, with all the kids, only one 
picture. My brother is on it, and 
I am. You know, real small picture. 
Q: Really? 
A: I don™t know how that one got
 saved. I™ll tell you late
r how we got rid of our pictures. But 
some how that picture is there. 
There was a school, and they had exercise in the morning for the 
children, and this neighbor, he was our math teach
er, he was also from Vienna with hi s wife. 
And they had -- they had, I think, even religi
on in there, they had 
religion, and singing, you 
know, and it was -- and I ma de 
a lot of friends, girlfriends. 

Q: You did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
55 
 
A: I ma de s o me  girlfriends, and I still have litt
le doilies from Ferramonti that one of the -- my 
friends had, and she gave them to me. There were lik
e four -- five sisters,
 and she gave them to 
me  to e mbroider. Cause you know, I was always with
 the needle in my hand. And so I started to 
embroider, you know, to ey -- I loved to do those things. Not now any mo re, but I did then. So I 

still have that, would you belie
ve it? Never finished them. 
Q: You never finished them?  

A: Never finished them. But I cannot 
part with them. Isn™t that silly? 
Q: Were they small doilies, those doilies? 

A: Yeah, they™re small, and what you can do is you can then put them together -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and ma ke, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. I ha -- still have those. 
Q: So where did you learn to do al
l of that, you just
 picked it up? 
A: I just picked it up. Like I said, Mother taught
 me  to knit. Thank God she didn™t teach me  to 
sew, because she couldn™t sew on a button. I don™t know how come  I could. But she was a 
terrific knitter. She knitted b
eautifully. And crochet so-so, butshe was knitter. She ma de my 
coat, my dress, you know, knitted sweaters and st
uff like that. She was good at it. And I don™t 
know why I did -- did. 

Q: Did you like school?  School must have been odd for you, be -- 

A: Because going in and out of school. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
56 
 
A: We ll, I liked school in Ferramonti. That was my 
last school. I didn™t go
 to school til I came to 
the States. And I was si -- almost 16. I hated ev
ery second of it. I hated 
it so much, I c annot tell 
you, because they didn™t know where to put
 me . I didn™t have school, I was old -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- old, ancient. 

Q: 16. 

A: Wh- Whe re do you put a person like that? 
So they put me  in the seventh grade. 
Q: As a 16 year old? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That mus t  have been awful.

Q: But I™m wondering what

til we got out of Ferramo nti.  

Q: Right. And they of course, even if they

A: Oh yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: I thought it was going to end. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
65 
 
Q: But your brother didn™t. 
A: He -- I don™t know what he thought, but he 
wa s very fearful. Maybe cause he was a boy and 
he knew they were taking me n, you know, for instan
 -- I don™t know what he was, but he was 
quite upset. 

Q: Right. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: How -- how did it happen that you left Ferramonti di Tarsia. 

A: They ma de us go there. 

Q: They ma de you leave. Did everybody -- 

A: Because we wanted to be together with my da

come  to us. 

Q: Right. 

A: So they ma de us go there, together. 
Q: No, whe n you -- when you were going to leave Ferramonti, did they -- how -- how di -- 
A: Oh. We  had to leave because they™re gonna close the camp. 

Q: They were going to close it? 

A: Yeah, they going to close out the camp, cause
 of sickness, I think, and I don™t know, they 
were gonna close it. So we had 
a choice where to go, you know in It
aly, always in Italy. So we 
didn't want to stay too far down, and we didn™t -- 
my dad didn™t want to go to close to Germany -
- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Up too high. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
66 
 
A: See?  So we chose like in the mi ddle, like in 
Toscana, there. So they came  up then, when we 
said the mi ddle, that ™s what they came up with, Grosseto. 
Q: Grosseto. 

A: Which was the big city, and we went to
 Pari, which was the town where we went. 
Q: And was Pari nee gro
sset -- near grosset -- 
A: It™s a province of Grosseto. 

Q: I see. 

A: And whe n we arrived on a bus, that I reme mb
er, we were on a bus. We got off the bus, and 
the Italian knew the children, the Jews are comi ng. 
So they looked at us, and then a fe w of the m 
came to touch us, I swear to you, to touch us. And 
then they said, you feel
 just like we do. You 
know, you don™t feel any different. You know, because they he ard on the radio so much from 

Hitler that  we are such different people, beasts or whatever. So we have to feel different. Well, 

they didn™t see that. So they got very affectionate with us, and we became friends with the people 
in -- in the town, and my dad and my brother st
arted to work in the fields, to ma ke, you know, 
some  money, or even for trading for food. 
Q: Right. 

A: And they worked very hard, they worked so 
hard, they had to -- you know, they got jobs, wa -
- but nobody really wanted, I mean, they were doing it, but as long as they
 had someone else to 
do it -- like to build trenches for the grapes
, you know, you had [indeciphe
rable] but they were 
full of stone and rock, and with that thing 
that they were knocking, you know. I mean, their 

hands were just a me ss, everything was a me ss. 
And -- but you know, they tried their best to go 
do it, and they did their job. And 
then came summer, so they worked in the fields again to cut 
weed, you know, cut the weed. Why do I reme mb er th
at?  Because in the bigge
st heat, we had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
67 
 
go and bring them lunch, okay?  Mom cooked, and I ha
d to go and take it to them in a basket, you 
know, the hot food. I don™t know why you needed hot
 food, it™s hot like hell. Excuse me . And 
that was the rule, they had to ha
ve lunch. And I hated to walk th
ere, it was so hot. Didn™t have 
the best shoes, you know, to walk, but I did, an
d I brought them food there. And whenever I 
didn™t have to, I was very happy. Some ti me s my
 mo m went, you know, which was even harder 
for her. I was -- I was a little
 spoiled rotten kid, I didn™t wa
nt to do it, but I did. And -- 
Q: You were a spoiled rotten kid?  You don™t so
und like -- you didn™t sou
nd like one before, all 
of a sudden? 
A: I know, all of a sudden I™m a spoiled rotten -- 

Q: Did people tell you you were spoiled? 

A: No. 

Q: No. But you really felt -- 

A: I was not spoiled. 
Q: You weren't spoiled. 
A: No, I wasn™t. And then -- 

Q: Where were you living in Pari? 

A: Pari?  Yeah -- i-in a house, we were living in
 a house. Trying to think. The f -- when we first 
got there, we lived in a house with -- we each a 
room, but we lived with another family for the 
kitchen -- we  shared the kitchen. But we had th
e room, but that didn™t
 work out too good, and 
then some thing opened up that we were able to
 move into a house. The only good thing was that 
house had a bathroom, while this house did not 
have a bathroom, which was nothing unusual not 
to have a bathroom. And -- but th
ere was a sta -- sta -- a stalla
 -- stall where the -- where the 
cows were going in. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
68 
 
Q: A barn? 
A: A barn. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Under the house that was, like. So we had to
 go there to go to the 
bathroom, with the -- 
Q: Wa s there an outhouse? 

A: Yeah -- no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, was just there. 

Q: Just there. 

A: Yeah, very, very embarrassing to me , I --I wa
s very upset about it. And anyway, was not easy. 
So we lived there in that house, and in -- in
 that town you had to 
-- you baked your own bread, 
okay?  I went to work. I went to 
work. I started to sew with differe
nt dressmakers, they taught me  
how. Okay, I went to a dressmak -- I couldn™t go 
to school, we were not allowed to go to school. 
A n d  my  ma  - -  

Q: Because you were Jews? 

A: Because we were Jews. And my mother knew 
that I like, you know, to work with my hands, 
so she says, how about if you would -- so they accepted me , you know, the dressmakers, and I 

started to work for different dressmaker, you know,
 whenever one needed me , I went there and I 
worked, and I learned, too, you know, while I wor
k. They tried to teach me, and -- ironing, you 
know, whatever needed to be done. Sf -- finish ing -- first it was finishing work, which now 

doesn™t exist, finishing, the machine finish 
it. But it was all done by hand, you know, fi nishing, 
and then I ma de garments, slowly, you know. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  if this is 1942 - 1943?  
So are you, 12 years old, you™re 13 years old? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
69 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You™re 12. 

A: Going on 11, ma ybe. 

Q: You think it was ™42? 

A: 11, yeah. Some thing like that. Because then
 I went into the w
oods, so I know. But -- 
Q: So you™re going every day to 
this work?  Five days a week? 
A: I go every day to this work, and what was 
bad, we didn™t have much food in the house, 
because the Italian people, as wonderful as they
 are, they were stingy with giving you food, 
okay?  Cause they tried to horde 
whatever they could. So, ma ny 
times my mother and I walked 
miles to see by the farme r s what they -- what we 
could get. Like we went -- you™re familiar with 
ricotta cheese? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: They -- wonderful ricotta chees
e. Some times we had luck that 
they gave us some . May -- we 
were ready to pay, we didn™t want for nothing. A
nd some ti mes they said they don™t have, or -- 
usually at noon they were all, the farmers sitti
ng on a big table having a feast. And we say could 
we have -- I don™t know, some jelly, some whatev
er. Oh, we™re just out of it today. You know. I 
was so hungry, I walked so much, you know. And th
ey just -- some  didn™t want to give. Some  
didn™t want to give. And some  ma de me  a sandwi c
h, ma ybe, a nd gave it to me . But they were not 
-- the farmers were not that generous. They were 
more generous, my friends in the ci -- in the 
town, than the farmers were. Like a potato in 
one, and some thing, you know. And I think to this 
day I hate the walking, because I walked so much for nothing, you know. Anyway, it™s a good 

excuse. And so then -- yeah, we -- I was sewing,and I enjoyed it, different -- yeah, I know what I 

wanted to say. And they always had mi dday, in 
the morning, the kids all had something to eat, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
70 
 
they brought there stuff to eat. We ll, I didn™t al
ways have, you know, so I just walked out, 
because I didn™t want to see,
 and yet I was hungry, you know, child
ren. So once in awhile they 
would give me  some thi ng, and -- but most of 
the time not. And then in
 the afternoon was the 
same  thing. They were eating in the afternoon. 
And I had just enough for lunch, I didn™t have 
leftover from. So I was hungry, I was always hungr
y. But they just didn™t give, you know, so -- 
one day I was so hungry, and I looked every placein the house for some th
ing to eat, and all I 
could find was an onion, a small onion. And I bit into
 it like I don™t know what. And I just ate the 
last thing in the house, that da
y, you know, the next day we got agai
n something, but just to tell 
you how hungry I was. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, children get so hungry. So I was young. 
Like to say, I wasn™t even 11 yet, I don™t 
think. Yeah, I was 11 while I was in the woods, so [indecipherable] 

Q: So this was earlier. 
A: Yeah. I reme mber because of -- got my period in the woods. 
Q: In the woods, yeah. 

A: That™s why I reme mb er that I -- my age. 
Whic h was another terrible thing. But anyway, 

before I get into the woods, how did we get in
t -- to the woods?  You ha
d to do your own bread, 
okay?  Now, you ma de the bread, and there was on
e bakery in town, where you call them in the 
evening and you say, I™m ma king bread, so they co
me  and pick it up and put it in the oven. So 
my mother called in, went to them that she is 
ma king bread. So she says, okay, I™ll be there to get 
it in the morning. So they ma de the bread, and 
then next thing you know, some body come s to tell 
us, you better leave right now, cau
se five o™clock in the morning the Germans are going to be 
here to pick you up. We  don™t have bread, you kn
ow, obviously, and one of our Italian friends 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
71 
 
gave us a bread, you know, to take, and my cat, 
my Muschi, she wanted -- you know, we had to 
leave her, so I left her with 
a friend. And it was pouring rain. I ha
d open shoes, but that™s all I 
had, you know. So anyway, we said okay, let™s go. There was two more  families there with -- 
actually three. Two of them in a diffe rent direc
tion -- there was a couple --
 like my brother said, 
some body Russian. There was a Russian ma n, Russian 
Jew. He was ma rried to a Gentile German 
lady, who stuck with him. They we
re like so tall, and especially 
I was so little, I thought they 
were two giant. But they were tall. And they
 went one way with another couple who had two 
boys from Vienna, they were from Vienna. And 
we went with a couple with two children. Small 
-- little smaller than me , a boy and a girl, so ther
e™s -- they came with us, in the same  place. So 
we kept on walking and walking and walking, and 
all of a sudden we were
 ready to enter the 
woods, and I hear a cat. My cat followed me  in
to the woods. I don™t know how she got out. And, 
you know, cats don™t like wet, don™t lik
e rain, she came right in the ra
in with us. So, of course, 
with everything else, I had the cat, so I pick
ed her up, I don™t care, you know, I picked her up 
because I felt sorry for he r. But later on you will 
see, the cat li -- saved our life. So anyway, I 
pick up the cat, and we go into 
thewoods. We  have no 
place to stay, and it™
s raining. We  had 
like a tarp, and we put on the floor, and -- to s
it on, you know, and it was -- we didn't have much 
food, the -- these friends gave us some bread, 
and I don™t know, ma ybe a piece of cheese, I don™t 
reme mber what she gave us. But whatever she 
wa -- she gave us, was wonderful. So in the 
morning, then we heard later, this woma n come s.
 ﬁMia,ﬂ that was my mot her, ﬁa far il pane.ﬂ 
Make bread. Because she gives you the signal when to ma ke the bread, and then she come s and 

picks it up. Well, Mia™s not answering, and she 
cannot understand, so she 
is knocking, and no -- I 
-- that™s what they told us later, she™s 
knocking and knocking and she runs up, she sees 
some thing is wrong, and she finds we™re gone. And 
10 mi nutes later the Germans were there to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
72 
 
pick us up. And nobody knew, you know, what happened 
to us. And this woma n says she called 
to ma ke bread, that™s impossible, they have
 to be here. We ll, some body saved our life. 
Q: Do you know who that was? 
A: Later on we found out who it was. It was a bi
shop from Gr osseto, a bishop that called, I guess 
the priest of the town, I don™t know who exactly, but he left word 
for us to leave. So he must 

have been, you know -- heard or whatever. And 
boy was he right, you know?  He just saved all 
our lives. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: And we went into the woods, and there wasonly a couple of people that knew where we were 

going, what woods, because there lots of woods. 
And eventually, while we were there, they 
brought us some  bread, or some thing, you know. 

Q: From the  town?  From Pari? 

A: From the  town, from Pari, yes. 
Q: So how did -- how did people find out in Pa
ri, where you were?  Did some one go back and tell 
them? 
A: Not -- not people, certain people. 

Q: Certain people. 

A: Certain people. Certain peopl e -- there was one guy, he would have given his life if some body 

would have told him where we are, you know? 

Q: Really? 

A: A Fascist, a real Fascist. But they knew it,
 and nobody told him where we are. And -- and in 
those mountains we had people th
at made coal, carbonia, a -- well,
 they we re coal. And they 
knew us, and they wanted to keep us safe, you know
. And once in awhile th
ey gave us, if they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
73 
 
had leftover bread or some thing, they gave us. A
nd then one day they™re sitting around, and here 
come s the Fascist, and they knew, you know, the Fa
scist. So they™re talking to him, which I 
heard later, and one of the guys is just there 
with one of those things
 that you chop wood with, 
you know?  

Q: An axe? 

A: An axe. And just talked to him, and just 
does that with the axe, you know, so he got the 
picture that if you talk, or if you don™t behave
 -- do you know where these Jews are?  You know, 
he was asking. I would like to give them, you kno
w, bring them some  food or some thing. And he 
said we have no idea where they are, and he
 was going, you know -- so you know, we had close 
calls, very close calls. But nobody spoke, nobody gave us away, where we are. Now -- 

Q: Now, these were Germans who were comi ng after you. 

A: No, no -- 

Q: Not Italian. 
A: -- Italian. 
Q: There™s -- 

A: Oh, the Germans we re going to come  and pick us up -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- yes, yes. 

Q: But this Fascist is a --   

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- is an Italian. 

A: An Italian, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
74 
 
A: Yeah. And he would have given anything if 
he could have caught -- catch us. I don™t know 
why, we didn™t do anything to him, but it was a Fa
scist, a -- we didn™t 
do anything to the Nazis 
either, but they did to us. So anyway, nobody spoke
, and then we had a very hard time . Finally, 
they helped us build a shack, just to have a 
little, you know, protection fr
om the weather. And it 
was like from the trees, the branches, ma de from branches, cause these people knew how to do 
that, and they helped us, the people that -- the 
coal mi ners. And then you had to take from the 
earth, and you know, fill in, and then they ma de lik
e beds from th -- from the branches, and then 
put straw on it, you know, to lay on it, but a -- sma
ll. And we were trying to be close. And one 
turned, the ot her one ha d to turn, you know what I mean?  It wa s so hard, because you know, 

branches are not -- nothing is smooth, and th
e straw was falling right
 through. Anyway -- 
Q: So it wasn™t such a great situ -- 

A: It wasn™t a great situation, but
 it was a little bit -- you know, we were real prepared for the bad 
weather, because it was snowing, too. And you had to whisper the whole time, cause in the 
woods your voice carries, far away, you know?   
Q: So what are you ins -- excuse me  --  

A: Inside -- 

Q: -- inside the woods, o -- and -- 

A: -- in this thing, and the first 
night, in fact, the thing, the roof 
fell in, so all the me n -- the two 
men and my brother and the othe
r boy, all night had to sit with some thing to hold it up, you 
know, the roof up. We  c ouldn™t ma ke much of a fi
re because we didn™t wa nt anybody to see the 

smoke. During the day was completely a no-no with th
e fire, but in the night we tried to do little 
bit open fire to keep a little warm, you know?  And 
we still had the cat. And the cat disappeared, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
75 
 
and I was beside myself, the Germans killed my 
c a t, they took my cat. But she found herself a 
boyfriend. 
Q: She found herself a boyfriend? 

A: And she came -- she came home pregnant. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. That we didn™t need, believe me . So
 she  came home pregnant
 and had four little 
kittens.  

Q: Oh my goodness. 

A: So then we got -- we asked this guy that br
ought us food to leave th
e -- the cha -- the little 
basket, so we  can put in, you know. And then he had 
to find us some one to wa
nt the little -- after 
-- you know, after awhile, to take them. And 
she was just ma rching behind, you know, her 
kittens, when we were moving from place to pl ace,
 cause we never tried to stay too long in one 
place. Even when we came to sleep and we always
 tried to go away from the place, and watch 
who goes by and -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- you know, we were constantly in fear, c
onstantly. We  never knew. And then there were 
bombardme nts, and we were next
 to a river, and it sounded --
 you know the sound was so harsh, 
or strong. And we thought always, we ™re next, you know, they™re gonna bombard us next. But it 

didn™t happen, but the fear was constant, the fe
ar was constant. And whispering. Then one day, 
this couple, that Russian couple,
 she, poor woma n, got hysterical, you know, from all of the stuff 
going on. I don™t know what she was, but she star
ted to scream. And that
™s the worst thing you 
can do in -- in the woods. So he tried to calm her down and everything, but, you know, she went 

through a lot of stress, and she probably was 
thinking, why am I here? You know, I have no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
76 
 
reason, but she stuck it out, but sh
e just lost it. And we were -- so we had to move from there 
right away, cause we thought, uh-oh. 
And another thing what was havi
ng, they had a forest fires. 
So we were worried about that, you know, that™s 
it™s gonna -- we could feel, you know, the heat 
from the fire. So again we were on the run. Consta
ntly on the run, in the w
oods, in the rain, in the 
heat. And oh, was -- one day it was snowing so ha
rd. And we were without
 anything. We  didn™t 
have a piece of bread, we didn™t have anythi
ng to eat. So we thought, okay we™ll just -- you 
know, nothing you can do. And here come s this ma n, this blessed ma n. 
Q: With food. And is this some body that you knew? 

A: He™s the one that a 
-- that brought us food -- 
Q: Before. 

A: -- before. He was really not from Pari, he 
was from the big city, he was what they called 
sfolato. Whe n -- when they starte
d to bombard the big ci
ties, they all came to the small town. We 
had a lot of people from Pisa. In fact, I fell inlove with a guy from Pisa. And he was -- but he 
was from Si ena, I think. And he was wonderful
, can you believe it?  The biggest snow, here 
come s this ma n. He says, ﬁI knew y
ou didn™t have.ﬂ An angel. Angel. 
Q: That™s fabulous. Okay, I 
have to change the tape. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
77 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: What was the name of th
e ma n who brought you the food? 
A: Dario. 
Q: And wa -- was Dario fro m Pari? 

A: Ye -- yeah, he lived in Pari because he was fr
om the city and I think he had some  relatives in 
Pari, and that™s how he got to Pari. 

Q: And how do you think he found you?  Do people know, were there -- 

A: I think -- wait a mi nute, I think word was sent 
to him where we are. You see, I -- I had one -- 
one change of clothes, I didn™
t have much, but we had a bi
g oversea case, you know, one of 
those wooden things that we left at the church. Th
e priest took it in for us. So when we  need a 
piece of something, some body went there and got it,
 and br ought it to us. And this othe r couple 
that was with us, was -- this woma n there was 
about my size, only she was taller, she was a 
woma n, I was a child, so -- but that
™s besides the point. Anyway, I wa
s -- my skirt was getting -- 
not that I was getting so tall, but still I was grow
ing, and my skirt was getting shorter and shorter. 
So it was not a good thing, you know?  
Anyway that™s that. Okay. 
Q: Two mor e  questions now, for this -- for this pa
rticular part. One is, how in heaven™s name  did 
you get a cat in the first place?  How did you get Muschi? 

A: We ll, it™s not hard 
to get a cat in It aly. 
Q: No?  Lots of cats? 

A: No. Lots of cats. And -- and we got her, you 
know, some body gave her to me  when she was a 
little kitten, and you know, it was just perfect. Wher
ever you went there was 
a cat, so I had a cat 
of my own, which was great. But we all love
d Muschi, everybody loved Muschi, and -- except 
our people that were in the roo 
-- in the thing with us didn™t li
ke it because she stole some  food 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
78 
 
from the m. But she put it under the be -- under th
e thing. I me an, they know we have a cat, so 
why did they put it under there?  Anyway. 
Q: And you gave the cat the name  of your doll? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Right. 

A: Muschi. 

Q: What did Muschi look like?  Wa s she a light cat, a dark cat? 

A: She was a gray cat with white. She was perfect. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: She was perfect, just beautiful cat. I always 
promised her I™ ll take her to the United States 

with me . And I would have, had she survived. Bu
t see, with all the bombardme nts and with all 
the shooting, she went wild. 

Q: Really? 
A: Sh-She turned wild. I was holding her when we
 were liberated -- getting ahead of myself, but 
we were liberate -- I was carrying her because a lo
t of dogs and other animals came, so I figured 
she mi ght be afraid. So I h-held her. And then she 
si -- this dog barked at her and she jumped off 
my hand and scratched me  from here to here, whic
h she never, ever did, from fear, and she went 
back to where we stayed, the farmers told us that
 they saw her. And that 
is quite a trip she took 
back, I guess looking for us, poor cat. But she 
couldn™t -- and we told them, you know, if you 
ever see her, please, you know, we 
want her back. But the farmer said they never saw her again. 
She just kept on looking for us and looking for us
, I guess. So I couldn™t keep my promi se and 
bring her. 
Q: Yeah, couldn™t bring her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
79 
 
A: Which was very hard. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because as we got into the woods 
-- I told you that she saved our life -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- cause finally we got away from wherever 
we  were, far away, and there was a farmhouse, an 
empty far mhouse. I don™t know if it was a farm
house -- anyway, was a -- was a building, okay, 
where they stored hay and everything for the an
imals. And t hey had a lot of cherry trees around 
there, so we have, you know, food. And so we went
 in there, we were two -- by then we were 
two couples, you know, the other couple with two 
children and -- and us. 
And Muschi was with 
us, and I look at Muschi, and she™s looking in 
-- in a direction. And I™m following her eyes, 
there™s four German sol diers comi ng our way.  

Q: And she™s not ma king a sound -- 

A: And she™s looking -- 
Q: -- she™s just looking. 
A: -- looking. But I could see th
e -- where she was looking, thank G
od she is looking in the right 
direction. And just sat there, you know, and 
looked. So I told -- you know, everybody, they are 
here. So the me n got out of that building, which 
was him, his  son, and my  brother, my father, 
four of the m jumped out of the building, a
nd we didn™t know where th
ey were going, but out. 
And we quickly -- I put on a kerchief, you know, I ma
de myself reallylook
 like -- all of us like 
far mers, we™re all farmers. Course we didn™t 
speak German, you know, or anything. And all of a 
sudden, we hear a gunshot. A gunshot, we didn™
t know. They didn™t know if some body shot us, 
and we didn™t know if some one shot them. So then
 here they come  to the door, the Germans to 
our door. And they say some thing in German, a
nd we just said [indecipherable] you know, like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
80 
 
we don™t know what they™re talking about. But then
 they say -- one says to the other, you idiot, 
you didn™t kill the cat. Thank God. They were shoo
ting at the cat, and as they were talking, the 
cat came running inside, see?  So we were relieve
d that they didn™t kill
 the cat, and thank God 
they didn™t shoot at the me n. But 
the me n didn™t know that yet, okay?  So they left. They left. We  
were not important, they left. They saw there wa
s nothing but hay there, a
nd [indecipherable]. So 
then, we could hardly wait for the me n to see --
 so here they come , God, a ll in one piece, you 
know, with like -- but we knew we ha
d to leave that place. So wh
at we did, outside that house, 
we made room for our pictures. We buried the 
pictures, and my dad knew shorthand, and he 
wrote shorthand every day of our 
stay in the woods, th
e whole life he wrote 
in shorthand. So he 
put that down there, and pictures
 of ours from fa mily, you know, 
whatever we had. I don™t think 
there was money. Whatever -- anyway, we all bur
ied it. And we figure, but -- you know, pretty 
down deep so it shouldn™t get wet. And we left 
there, and we went -- 
you know, inside the woods 
a long different direction. And then -- trying to 
think, you know what happened 
first, it™s hard to 
reme mber. Went there, and we 
buried that, and then -- and then
 we went on. Which was a big 
mi stake, cause we got caught in the mi ddle of 
shooting, the Germans -- a
nd the French liberated 
us, the French and the Moroccans. And they were
 shooting at each ot her, and we were in the 
mi ddle. Oka y?  The French -- we finally saw a Frenchma n, and we™re so happy, and he says, go 

away, go away. And we didn™t know why he say -- tell us to go away. You know, you™re so 

stupid some times. Anyway, all of a sudden we™re ju
st in the mi ddle of all this fighting going on. 
And my poor dad and mom wanted to
 protect us, so they each laid on us. Dad laid on me , and 
Mom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn
™t hit us. We  laid there for hours. And then 
finally, it™s kind of stopped, so 
we kind of thought, let™s go back 
to the house and get our stuff 
and get out of -- out of here. So when we got 
to the house, everything was -- they ripped the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
81 
 
pictures, whoever found. See, they thought ma
ybe we had mo ney that we buried. Mut -- 
some body must have seen us do that, but they t
hought ma ybe it was money and when that wasn™t 
money, they was ma d, so they ripped things, 
you know. And so my Da
d™s -- all that writing 
went, and we lost a lot of pictures, which 
we were holding onto lik
e dear life, okay?   
Q: You got some  pictures back?  Some  
of them were still okay? Nothing? 
A: Nothing. 
Q: Nothing. 

A: Nothing was still okay, everything was torn apar
t. And yeah, the pictures of grandparents, you 
know, and the brothers and sisters. So then we 
went, and all of a sudden -- we got out of the 
house, we figured well, you know, we™ll go and s
ee what -- which side
 we™re gonna go on, we 
didn™t know where to go. So one of the Moroccan
s here got -- one of them are on the mule -- on 
those big mules, and they are up there, and we
™re down here. And they point to me , and they 
point to the other lady, the mother of the 
other, she was still a younger woma n, blonde, you 
know. And s he wants us -- she want 
-- he wants us to go with him.
 So we all started to cry, you 
know?  My mother is on her knees, begging. The 
kids are crying. I mean, it was a scene. And 
we™re trying to think what to give him, he 
shouldn™t take us, you know?  And my mother had the 
wedding ring. So she says here, you want this do
 -- and there were no -- not much conversation 
because they -- they di dn™t understand each othe
r, but I think with hands and move ments you 
could tell what we were about. So
 Mother takes off that, and my 
brother had a watch, so -- and 
took off the watch to give to him. He  took it. He
 took it. So we didn™t kno
w, are we safe now, or 
what does he want, you know?  And he™s still poin
ting to me  and her. And my mother grow 
hysterical, you know?  Being liberated and not libe
rated. So finally there 
were like some  cows 
there on the field. And some how he
 -- he said to us, okay, you can have the cows, or some  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
82 
 
that™s how we understood, you know, we don™t know what
 he said. And they all have gold teeth, 
you know, and they™re so disgusting, you know, 
they™re not -- the beards, and oh, horrible 
looking. Anyway, he left. He 
left. My mother faints. 
Q: Your mother fainted. 

A: So we got her, you know, going. Said, we have 
to leave this place. Th
en the other lady -- my 
skirt was up to here, you know?  So she gave me  
one of her skirts, which covered me , and a 
blouse with long sleeves. You know, they ma de
 me  look, you know, unattractive as possible. 
And a-again, you know, scarf on the head, anything they could do to ma ke me  look bad. So I 

said, okay, we are going. And we 
started to walk towards a to
wn, different town. And we™re 
going, and all of a sudden here™s this guy. 

Q: Again? 

A: The same  guy. My poor mo m, she passed out again.  

Q: She -- 
A: She passed out again. I thought this time she di
ed. I was sure she™s gone. Anyway, he rode -- 
he rode away. 
Q: He didn™t say anything? 

A: He ro -- he didn™t -- he said some thing, but 
don™t ask me  what, and he rode away. And we 
rushed to a fa rmhouse, where we knew partisan
s usually, you know, me t, or I don™t know what 
we knew. Anyway, we go there, and they have
 surrounded the -- that room, that house. The 
Moroccans, they surrounded that house, barefoot, you know, they come  and sneak up on you. I 

mean, it™s a horrible thing. And we
 fi nally opened the door and got 
in and here are the partisans 
inside. And I am hysterical. And then
 -- til then I was fine. And when I saw them, I got hi -- I -- I 

really lost  it, I was hysterical cr
ying to them. The y were so sweet and so nice. They assured me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
83 
 
everythi ng will be okay, you know, and stuff like that
. Was horribl e. So then they left, the -- the 
guys left. 

Q: Which ones? 

A: The Moroccans -- 

Q: The Moroccan -- 

A: -- left. And they kind of helped us to get in
to a town that was not t
oo far from the woods, and 
-- which we did. In fear every step of the 
way. We  were liberated, and not liberated. You 
understand?  

Q: Sure, because everything™s in chaos.  

A: We  didn™t know if -- if they™re
 comi ng back, or if they -- we
 didn™t know what they were 
gonna do. They could have shot us, they could have
 -- and they could have shot my parents and 
then taken us, and you know, we just didn™t 
know what they were gonna do. Because for 24 

hours the Moroccan had free hand, they can do whatever they want to wome n. And they did a lot 
of da ma ge. They were very, very rude, very m
ean. So we were lucky that we -- we got away 
with that . 
Q: Wa s this some thing that you understood what 
your mother was really
 afraid of, that you 
would be raped?  Did you -- 

A: No. 

Q: You didn™t know. 

A: I didn™t know. I didn™t -- 

Q: You didn™t realize. You knew it wasn™t good. 

A: I know it wasn™t good. I know it wasn™t good to
 go with this guy. And I wouldn™t want to go 
with this guy, I knew that. Gosh, I knew it. But 
of course, I didn™t see as much danger as my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
84 
 
parents did, you know?  Oh, it was horrible. And that
 -- that was our liber
ation, don™t forget. And 
then, I could not stand to see a soldier,
 I was afraid of every soldier I saw. 
Q: Didn™t matter. 
A: Didn™t matter what soldier -- 

Q: Who they were, uh-huh. 

A: -- they were. I was afraid. We finally stoppe
d in a town where we got a little break and 
washed up, and some  pe ople gave us some  food, 
you know. Was not Pari, was town before Pari, 
but they helped us, you know?  And we walked all the time, just walk and walk and walk. 

Q: But were you trying to get to Pari
?  Is that where you™re trying to go -- 
A: We tried to get to Pari  -- 

Q: -- you™re trying to get back to Pari? 

A: -- Pari, yeah. But I don™t -- 

Q: Because you know people there, a
nd you know that they would help you. 
A: Yeah, and we have our stuff there still, and --  

Q: The woods that you were in, wa
s it south of Pa ri, or east of -- 
A: It was actually -- was the Si
ena woods, not Grosseto woods.  
Q: I see. 

A: We  went into Siena woods. We  just kept 
walking, we don™t know where we™re going, we just 
kept walking. 

Q: And this other couple w
ith the two kids, do they rema
in with you? Or they left? 
A: Yes, they were -- 

Q: They remained with you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
85 
 
A: They remained with us all the way through. Th
e -- the Russian, which is 
why -- they went to a 
different woods. They went some body else, and th
e other couple from Vienna, with two boys, I 
understand that the Germans too -- found one of th
e boys. He tried to, you know, talk his way out 
of that he™s fr om the farm, you know, and I don™
t really know whatever happened to them. Lost 
contact, cause they didn™t come  back to Pari, 
so it was just rumor, we
 didn™t know exactly -- 
Q: Exactly, right. 

A: -- what happened. And they were
 sad. In fact, one was Heinz -- 
Q: Sa me name. 

A: -- one of the boys was Heinz, and one wa
s Walter. The boys, you 
know. And so I don™t know 
what happened to them. But we went back to Pa
ri, and then we™re waiti
ng to get to America, 
still. Again, you know. And then my dad wo -- my br
other, they took the bus 
to Grosseto, to talk 
to the American, you know, for the liberation, whatever. And my dad says they were 

interrogating him, and my brother -- you did th
is, ooh, ooh, ooh. And my dad says to my brother, 
ﬁThis idiot thinks we™re spies.ﬂ In German. 

Q: In Germa n? 

A: In Germa n. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But he understood Ge rman, so he started to
 laugh. So, you know. Then we got -- he got some  
papers, and -- that we were okay 
to go, that we were not spies, by no me ans. I know I™m leaving 
some thing out, but I can™t think -- 

Q: Well let me -- let me go back -- 

A: -- yeah, ask me , ask me  question, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
86 
 
Q: -- I know that you -- let -- when you were in the Siena woods, I know it ma kes you 
uncomfortable, but it™s really
 important as a woman -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- to hear about this
. You™re a young girl -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- and you get your period for the first 
time  in the terrible circumstances. 
A: Terribl e. 

Q: So that taking care of yourself under
 those circumstances seems al most -- 
A: Terribl e. 

Q: -- impossible. 

A: I didn™t have anything. 

Q: Right. 

A: My mother -- there are me n here, that™s okay. 
Q: Oh forget it. 
A: I™ll ignore them. 

Q: Yes, we™ll ignore them. 

A: My mother took off her slip and tore it
 apart so that I should have some thing. 
Q: Have some thing, yeah. 

A: And they had a river where we went to wash
 things. But always af
raid who is seeing, you 
know. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
87 
 
A: I could ne ver really wash my
self because I always thought so
me body sitting in -- in the tree, 
you know?  And I never felt clean enough, you know. 
And it was so emba rrassing to me , so 
embarrassing, oh. 
Q: Did you know about me nstruation before it happene
d, had you been told that this mi ght -- this 

was going to happen? 

A: Not a great deal. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A little bit I was told, but not in my imagination -- 

Q: You didn™t. 

A: -- did I think -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- this was happening to me . Y
ou know, and I was only 11, don™t forget. 
Q: Right. 
A: Quite young. 
Q: So were you quite regular during this year 
in the woods?  You were getting your period every 
month?  

A: We ll, I didn™t get it at the very beginning. I di
dn™t get it at the very beginning, I got it little 
later. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But -- and always the wrong time. Whe -- when
 is the right time, you know, but always the 
wrong time. And I was terribly upset
 with it because I just had a 
hard time to handle. And the 
other girl that was with us, she was jeal
ous because she wante
d. I said you stupid.  
Q: She wanted to get it [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
88 
 
A: She wanted to -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- she felt more grown up, I 
guess. Was almost 12, I guess -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- when I got it, but more 11 than -- 

Q: But your mother must have been me nstruating -- 

A: Yeah, she was. 

Q: -- as well as this other woma n. 

A: They mu st have. Never told me . 

Q: But they didn™t -- 

A: Never knew. 

Q: You never knew. 

A: Never knew. They™re unbelievable 
what they did in those days.  
Q: It™s -- it™s one of those thi
ngs that people don™t think about. 
A: Gos -- 

Q: Do you know what I mean?  

A: Yes. 

Q: How -- how  

A: Yes. 

Q: The -- the so-called normal circumstance -- 

A: Right, yes. 

Q: -- of this kind of a situation. 

A: Oh, it was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
89 
 
Q: It was awful. 
A: Oh, awful, awful, awful. Really awful. So

couldn™t brush my teeth, 
didn™t have anything. 
Q: Right. 

A: Didn™t have -- we had the little soap, so
me body wa -- was shaving 
soap, you know, with like 
a tube. And that was the only soap. It™s a mi racl
e I didn™t have lice because
 I -- my hair was long, 
you know. 

Q: Your hair was long, so you 
did not -- you didn™t cut it. 
A: Long, I had braids, braided hair. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But there was no way to wash it.  

Q: So did everybody smell? 

A: No, I don™t -- 
Q: Do you reme mber? 
A: -- ma ybe I™m so -- was so used to the smell that it didn™t smell, I don™t know. 

Q: Maybe it was fortunate that 
you we re outside in that way. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Because ma ybe the air helped you.  

A: Maybe. I did not reme mber any terrible smell, you know, for some  reason. 

Q: Now, when you left Fe rramonti and went to Pa
ri -- I™m trying to figur

time frame when the allies have gone into Italy. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: When you leave Ferramonti,

A: No.  
Q: So Italy is still run by the 
Italians. So you don™t, in fact -- 

A: By the Germans, by the Germans. 

Q: The Germans were running? 

A: With the Italians, they were -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you know -- 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: -- they we re together in cahoots. 

Q: Right.  

A: There was one incident when a -- before I 
-- we  left into the woods. Pari was again, you 
know, round. Up on a hill and round. So I™m there by 
a friend at the beginning of Pari, and the 
highway, like the street, you know, 
were cars, two cars that come
, come  up the street, and I™m 
standing there with her and I™m watching the 
road to see if some body™s c o mi ng. And sure 
enough, four soldiers. They were alwa ys walk
ing in four, I don™t know why. Four German 
soldiers g -- are comi ng. So I wa s like -- that was before the woods
. I was like stuck to the floor, 

you know?  I didn™t know run back in or run back out 
or what do I do?  So I 
just stood there, and -
- and the farmer, they were talking to one of th
e guys down there, and he goes like this. I feel he 
is pointing at me . So I™ m really paralyzednow, but I don™t move. I didn™t know what to do. I 

stayed there and they™re comi ng up, they™re comi
ng up and they™re asking 
me  where is a bar? 
Q: Where™sthe barn? 

A: Bar. 

Q: Oh, bar. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
91 
 
A: Bar. So I figured, what do I do?  They told 
them that I speak German, ma ybe. Do I answer 
German, do I answer in Italian. Are they tes
ting me ?  I did not know. So I said, ober dar, you 
know, like broken German, like I knew
, and they went away and then they kind of looked back, 
like thinking, what did she say, 
you know?  Again, I was panicki
ng. I ran back in the house, 
finally. I was so worried, you know, that I did th
e wrong thing when I didn™t know what to do, 
you know?  Cause the way he pointed, I 
think that he pointed at me . 
Q: Right. 

A: He couldn™t talk to these people, so he point
ed at me . Oh my God. That™s one of -- another 
one of those fear-y things. 

Q: But it was okay. 

A: Yeah, it turned out okay. 

Q: They went to the bar and that was it. 

A: They went to the bar, hope they -- 
Q: You hope they got drunk. 
A: They got drunk, 
and other things. 
Q: And other things. And sick.  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And we have to change the tape. 

A: Yeah.

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Is there anything that we n
eed to know more about what ha
ppened to you in the forest?  Are 
there things -- 
A:  In t h e forest . 

Q: -- anything that stands out? 

A: Hunger, a lot of hunger. Always scared 
that some body™s gonna discover us. Broken up 
because the sleep, and again, going to the bathro
om. Don™t forget, you had to go into the woods, 
you know. And I was one to be sure ever
ybody™s here, nobody is going where I™m going. 
Q: You wanted a lot of privacy. 

A: I wanted privacy. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And then you never knew who wa s gonna be outthere, either. It was very, very difficult, 

another difficult time. And what else?  Waiting 
for food, worrying about my Muschi, and just 
worrying about everything, you know, I wa
s always worrying about things.  
Q: How did you all get along?  The two fa milies. 

A: We  got along pretty good -- 

Q: Yeah? 

A: -- with this family. I really 
cannot say that we had any -- the 
only time  we had really a fight 
was because of the cat.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Cause they finally had some  meat  and the 
cat took it, and not only 
that, brought her boyfriend 
in to help her eat it. 

Q: Did she leave you to go 
see her boyfriend a lot? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
93 
 
A: We ll, for awhile we thought we lost her. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We  thought we lost her, and then here sh
e comes, home pregnant
, just like a bad girl. 
Q: But she didn™t feel like a bad girl, I guess. 

A: No, she was a good girl. No. 

Q: So you did not keep her -- there wa
s -- there was no way 
to keep her -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- inside or anything. 

A: No, no. 

Q: She just roamed wherever she wanted. 

A: She -- wherever she wanted, you know. 

Q: Did she stick close to you very often? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Then she [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, you see she followed 
us in the worst weather -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- so she felt good with us, 
but she just was a bad girl. 
Q: Yes. She found a boyfriend [indecipherable] 

A: Found a boyfriend and that™s it. 

Q: Did you have any religious beliefs  as a little kid? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
94 
 
A: We ll, that™s a very sore subj
ect. I had religious beliefs becaus
e I was told to have religious 
beliefs. I had to, you know, go to synagogue, and when I went to synagogue -- we went to 
synagogue where the wo me n were upstairs, the me
n downstair, that wa
s my grandparents, you 
know. They were kosher. But my mot her never wa 
-- believed in it. She wa s a rebel then, to the 
end. And -- but she didn™t disturb 
their kitchen or anything. But wh
en we went out, or when she 
went out -- you don™t go out to eat in Vienna that
 much. But when she did go out, she did not eat 
kosher food, okay?  But she -- she re
spected whatever the hou -- 
Q: Right. 

A: We  couldn™t even tear the 
toilet paper on Shabbes. You know, had to be done Friday, cause 
you™re not supposed to tear. And when I drove my 
mother crazy the whole week I didn™t want to 
do anything, but came Saturday, I wanted to knit, 
I wanted to sew, I wanted to clean. Drove her 
nuts. The whole week you don™t want to do 
and s -- come  Saturday, you want to do it. 
Q: So this was when you were 
living with your grandparents? 
A: Yes. Grandparents, or even when I 
was with Mother visiting, or whatever. 
Q: Right. 

A: Wherever I was -- 

Q: You were a problem. 

A: I was a problem. They never let me  do what 
I wanted to do. And -- but they were wonderful 
grandparents, wonderful. So were my parents we
re wonderful grandparents, too, I must say.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Too good. They gave everything to their grandkid
s, they loved the grandki
ds. So I guess it™s -
- okay you asked me  about belief. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
95 
 
A: I thought -- you know, I never gave it much 
thought as a child. I kne
w I was Jewish, and I 
was Jewish. Big deal, I™m thinking now. I didn™t have to go through all of that, you know, but 
I™m Jewish, I™m -- I don™t believe in mi racles, 
you know. I don™t know what else I would believe 

in if it wasn™t Jewish. I don™t 
believe in a lot of things. You 
know, they all say the Bible, the 
Bible is a wonderful thing. Bu
t it™s written by people. God di
dn™t write the Bible, you know?  
That™s what I always feel. So what else am 
I gonna believe?  I™m not over religious, I™m not. And 
I think -- for some reason I™m not, whic
h I cannot completely
 say. I can™t say. 
Q: So you didn™t pray when you we
re in the forest, you didn™t -- 
A: Not much. 

Q: Do you think your parents did? 

A: My brother. My brot her was layi ng Tefillin every day. 

Q: You™re kidding me . 

A: After the -- he was Bar Mitvah™d. 
Q: Really? 
A: He was very religi
ous. But -- unbelievable. 
Q: So he carried the Tefillin with him. 

A: Yes, he carried the Tefillin and everythi ng.  

Q: Intere sting. 

A: But then, you know, he got away from it beca
use he ma rried a non-Jewish girl who did not 
believe in what he believes, which is okay, but 
went a little bit about
 it the wrong way, okay, and 
hurt us all a little b
it too much. What can I tell 
you?  So there™s not too mu
ch to argue about there. 
Q: But you never -- you never had much of a belief?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
96 
 
A: I think the reason I didn™t have much of a beli
ef, because of what happened to my  brother. I 
think that™s kind of -- kind of upset me  so mu
ch, and what happened to my parents, such 
disappointment that they had. And 
-- and they didn't  even ask for what they were accused of 
asking for. So anyway, I don™t want to tell you. 
Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. You -- there -- a -- on the one side when you talk about the 

Italians, they™re wonderful. 

A: Wonderful. 

Q: On the other side, you get put into a concen
tration camp, you are cert
ainly on the run, and -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- in real ly terrible circumstances -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- for at least a 
year, if not longer. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: That™s st ill in the context of Ital y, 
so is Italy a sort 
of a puzzle to you? 
A: No. 
Q: It™s not?  

A: Italy is wonderful. 

Q: It™s wonderful.  

A: Wonderful. If it wasn™t for 
Italy we  wouldn™t be alive. Th
ey helped us, the people were 
wonderful. The people that we knew, not -- there we
re some  son-of-a-gun that wanted to have 
our neck, okay, the heck with them. But mo
st people were helpful, most people were 

understanding. They were wonderful, that™s all 
I can tell you. They warned us, you know. They 
fed us whenever they could. Now there were some
 people that had, but didn™
t want to show that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
97 
 
they have, so they didn™t give, and -- cause 
they were afraid for themselves, ma ybe. I don™t 
know. But they™re wonderful peopl
e, they really are. I love
 them dearly, I really do. 
Q: Yeah. So let™s talk a bit about the 
DP ca mp you went to. It™s Cinecetta? 
A: Cinecitta. 
Q: Cinecitta. 

A: Cinecitta. 

Q: Cinecitta. In Rome . It-It™s

A: Right, right. 
Q: Which it then became afterwards again? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So is this the central pl
ace in Italy where the DPs were? 
A: DPs, yes, it really was. And they all got j
obs there. My husband™s mother was a cook in one 
of the kitchens. My mother was a cook in the 
big kitchen where all the refugees came. And my 
father was in -- kitchen employed. I was in the 
kitchen employed to give
 out cards so people 
shouldn™t double up on their food, see because they 
came twice, if it™s leftover, they we re 
welcome, but not take away from some body else the first one. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know. So I had to turn cards, and give
 them numbers, you know, if there was one me al, 
that™s what I was doing. And then I helped in th
e Red Cross, too, I was se
wing ma ttress coversin 
the Red Cross. 
Q: With a machine? 
A: With a machine. And then cam
e the rule that they were going 
to pay some thing for that work, 
but again, I was too young to get paid. 

Q: Cause you were what, thir -- 

A: I was not fif -- not quite 15, so my mother sa
id she™s too young to get paid, she™s too young to 
work, good-bye, You™re not working 
any more. And that was that, sh
e didn™t let me  work, cause 
they didn™t want to pay me . 

Q: So you™re not going to school.  

A: No. 

Q: And you™re not working. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
99 
 
A: No. I was working, you know, in the -- in the camp.  
Q: And you™re there from 1945 to 1940 -- 

A: Seven 

Q: 1947. So thr-thre 
-- three full years? 

A: Mm-hm, yeah, right. 

Q: It™s a long time. 

A: A long time , yeah. 

Q: And are you -- i -- ha -- what is th
e living situation?  Is it like -- 
A: Well, we had little rooms -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- on top where the dressing rooms were for the 
stars, okay?  So we -- being that we were 
working in Cinecitta, we got the rooms. There were
 a lot of people there, ha
d to live in big -- in 
the big rooms with divisions. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Like tents, drapes and some thing like that. But 
we were lucky that we were able to get -- they 
u -- we started out there, but then they let us 
move up. And then when my  brother got ma rried, he 
got a room, too. A differ e nt pl
ace, but he got a room, too. 
Q: So he got ma rried while you were still in the DP camp?  

A: Mm-h m.

Q: Yeah. [indecipherable]

there was a whole clique of them, whol e bunch of 
troublemake r s, including my brot
her, who was the instigator. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes, he was instigating, but he never did, yo
u know?  He was, let them do the dirty work. Wa s 
him and the guy that still, you know, lives in Kans
as City, who also is from Vienna, name  of 
Heinz Wi nkler. And -- 

Q: So what was he trying to instigate?  What sort of trouble? 

A: Some  trouble. I mean, stupid kid™s trouble,
 you know, no big troubles. But there wa s one 
crazy woma n on the hall, and they made her a li
ttle crazier, you know, and stuff like that. Just 
mi schief. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Nothing serious, mi schief. I think my husba

mi schief, yeah.

God, nothing changed, actually. 
Q: So it was a diffi cult time? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Was -- was -- 

A: He was annoying. 

Q: He was annoying, but he was interested in you. 

A: Looks like he was interested. 

Q: It looks like 
he was interested. 
A: Look like he was interested, yeah. 

Q: How -- w-when people talk a
bout liberation, and we use the 
word as if it™s completely 
wonderful thing, and it™s not so wonderful, because -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
102 
 
A: Not always, yeah. 
Q: -- right, because how in heaven™s name  do 
you put everything together when you™ve lost 
everythi ng? 

A: Yeah, it hard, very hard, yeah. 

Q: What did you think your future was goi
ng to be like? Did you have dreams ab -- 
A: Oh, I didn™t think mu ch because I always 
felt my parents protecting me  in every way, you 

know. As long as I had them, I didn™t worry. 

Q: So were you able to be a little girl 
in some  way, finally, or not?  You couldn™t. 
A: No. I don™t reme mber  ever doing that. I don™t re 
-- my mot her was very strict. I couldn™t wear 
lipstick til I was 18. I couldn™t date, forget about 
dating, my God. I took a pictur e with a friend, a 
guy, and I did like -- held my head
 like this against him. I t
hought the roof was gonna cave in. 
With a strange guy you™re taking a picture like th
at?  I had fur coat on, fur coat -- m- mouton -- 
mouton -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah -- 
A: -- do you reme mber mouton? 

Q: -- mouton, yeah, yeah, right. 

A: That was terrible -- it was good coat, warm, 
but don™t ever let it rain
 on you, cause you smell 
like crazy. So anyway, I was holding like this, and 
oh she had a fit. You know, stupid things like 
that, she -- and now don™t stay out too late, you know, I can™t sl
eep if you™re not here. Every 
Saturday ni ght I hear d that. 

Q: This is after liber ation? This

A: Yes, in New York, in New York already. 

Q: This is in New York? So
 it went -- it kept going?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
103 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: It™s -- but it started in the DP camp? 

A: Oh yeah, always in the DP ca
mp. I was -- I loved to dance, just loved to dance, and the first -- 
I was 13 in camp, when this soldier, a British sold
ier in fact, took me to dance. So I danced, it 
was nice, you know, I started to ma ke different 
steps which I didn™t rea
lly know. And he was so 
patient, he was so nice, he was 
not fresh, he was a gentlema n. A
nd the trouble was he left, and I 
could only da nce with him, I thought, you know. That
™s how silly a person is. So then another 
guy wanted to dance with me , so I said, I can™t 
dance with you, you dance different, I can™t dance 
with you. Oh yes, you can. So then he took me  to
 dance. Okay, so I danced with this guy. But 
then there wa s this great dancer. He was a 
black guy, not American black, from Abyss i nia, 
Ethiopia now. He was wonderful. He
 was Fred Astaire. And he really taught me  to dance. I was 

the first one on the dance floor, the last one off. 
He was terrific. And except that he was black, 
his features were white, you know
?  And he spoke perfect Italia
n. And you know, just a dancing 
partner. So my parents said, look, we ™re going do
wn to dance, we™ll be with you, I don™t want 
you to dance with him all the time . I said, ﬁI don™t
 have to dance with him at all if you don™t want 
me  to dance,ﬂ you know. Fresh little me . So I st
uck close to them, I made  believe I don™t see 
him. So this guy was smarter than me  or th
em, came over and said -- you know, greeted my 
parents nicely and said, ﬁDo you mi nd if your dau 
-- if your daughter dances with me ? ﬂ  Put them 

on the spot, and I had to dance again.  

Q: So good, you got a chance. 

A: So that was good, yeah. 

Q: That was good. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
104 
 
A: That was good. And that was, you know. But then
 he left, and then my  mother-in-law -- at 
that time I had no idea it was gonna be my moth
er-in-law, there was a Hungarian guy in camp 
they wanted to dance with me . I could not stand 
him. I absolutely could not stand him. And my 
mother-in-law kept on talking to him, giving him 
ideas how he could endear hims elf to me . And 
talked to him, you know, Hungarian, they were
 Hungarian. And he kept on bugging me . He was 
-- he took a job cleaning the hall
ways in Cinecitta so he coul
d see me , you know, in my  room 
and when I come out. I didn™t come out. I didn™t
 want to come out. And when I went to the 
dance, he came  over, kissed the hand, you know. 
Very polite guy. He wanted to dance with me . 
You know, I was mean enough to say no. 
Q: Really? 

A: I did. That™s how I could not stand him. I wa
s -- washed the floor in our room, and I took the 
pail to go to the bathroom to spill it out, he was th
ere, he want ed to do it. I didn™t want him to do 

it. I didn™t want him anywhere near me . I thi
nk my mother-in-law knew some thing. She tried to 
get rid of me a long time ago, it 
didn™t work. No, we had a good relations -- his mot her lived with 
me  for 40 years. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. He lived -- she wa
s -- she lived til she was 96. 
Q: No kidding? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Wo w. 

A: It™s good we got along. My fath
er-in-law died a littl
e younger, and then her sister came  from 
Italy, and she stayed with us. And they both died the same  year. 

Q: No kidding? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
105 
 
A: It was sad. So we got 
along, but I remi nded her of wh
at she was doing to me -- 
Q: And wha t  did she -- 
A: -- with Mr. kiss the hand. 

Q: And wha t  did she say? 

A: Laughs, you know, it was so funny. [indecipher
able] it™s not funny, I was mi serable. You 
ma d e  me  s o  mi s e r a b l e .  S h
e did, but she didn™t know.  
Q: So was it in some  way a -- an
 okay place to be? For the te -- 
A: Yeah, it was an okay place to be. How can 
I say, how can I explain it?  The boys had a 

wonderful time. 

Q: The boys did. 

A: The boys did, more than -- more than the girl
s. I mean, certain girls had a ball too, but I was 
not brought up to have a good time. I ha
d to be a good girl all the time. 
Q: Right. 
A: And to this day, shoot.  
Q: Do you resent that? 

A: Yes, I resent that. 

Q: You do? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you couldn™t get out of it, even when you -- 

A: I couldn™t get out even -- I ju
st couldn™t get out of it. She de
ma nded. She dema nde d that I be a 
good girl. 

Q: And so you -- you became a good girl. 

A: So I cow -- I obliged, y
eah. You can™t go back, you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
106 
 
Q: No, that™s true. 
A: And I didn™t want to be bad, 
but I wanted a little more freedom. Not every time. And then 
came Sunda y morning. My cute little nephews woke
 me  up every Sunday morning. They could 

hardly wait to have me  home. And then snuck 
in bed with me , and then my mother invited

A: My father started to be a busboy.  

Q: Busboy. 

A: But then he worked for Globe fa ct ory, which they ma de pie fillings and jellies. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah, which was not easy either. When he st
arted he was in the cooking [indecipherable]. 
Then later he worked hims elf up in shipping, so 
at least he didn™t have 
to be in that heat. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, was so hot there. And he was a 
shipping clerk. I guess they would say clerk. 
Q: [sneezed] Excuse me . 

A: Bless you. And he -- he was there all the ti

to Jersey and he moved with 
them. Yeah, and that™s wi --

A: Whom I didn™t like, whom I -- 

Q: So how do you re-meet him?

Q: The -- the fa mily was fr iends. 

A: The -- yeah, fa mily friend, and my brother was friends -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- so my husband has a different version 
of how we got back in touch than I do. 
Q: I see, okay, I want your version. 

A: My version is that they s -- they
 came here after us
, right, in ™49. 
Q: Right. 

A: So, I think he looked in the phone book for Ar
zt, the name . And he found Arzt. Then he 
called up us, and then of course we wanted to s
ee them right away, and we ma de arrangements to 
see them. And my husband thinks because they were
 in the paper that we  
saw the paper, and got 
ahold of them, but it wasn™t like
 that, but it™s okay, either stor
y is okay. But I think I™m right. 
Q: But you think you™re right
. I -- I™m sure. I™m sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
109 
 
A: He never asks me . [indecipherable] 
Q: Right.  

A: Never. 

Q: So what -- when you re-met, it was different? 

A: Yeah, when we -- when we re-met, I was -- I had a boyfriend. 

Q: You had a boyfriend? 

A: I had a boyfriend. 

Q: Oh, ho, ho. 

A: Yeah. So, he was jealous of the boyfriend. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the boyfriend was jealous of him. So 
it was a fun -- a fun time. But I guess he won. 
Q: I guess he won. And we™ll change the tape. 

A: He won the jackpot.

Q: So did you choose, or did th
ey -- did Zdenko choose, between 
you?  You were in the mi ddle. 
A: Choose me ?  
Q: Yeah. 

A: I didn™t choose him.  

Q: You didn™t. I 
don™t believe it. 
A: I gave in. 

Q: You gave in. 

A: I gave in. 

Q: You got tired. 

A: I was tired of saying no. But yo -- he called 
from Kansas City to New York as often as 
possible. Will you marry me?  No. Wi ll you marry 
me ?  No. Then he got, okay. Every da y, will 
you ma rry me . So -- and I was so tired. Then my 
mother said, ﬁYou™re driving him c r azy, just 
ma ke up your mi nd.ﬂ I said, ﬁI did make up my 
mi nd, but he doesn™t leave my mi nd a l one.ﬂ So -- 
and everybody, you know, liked him, and they 
liked me  and what do you mean, you belong 
together. I said, no. I was figh
ting and fighting it, but -- 
Q: But you gave up fighting. 

A: Yeah. And in -- now I™m really talking. The 
morning -- no, the morning before our wedding, 
the day before our wedding, I got 
a letter from my ex-
boyfriend wishing me well, and -- a very 
lovely letter saying how nice it 
was to know me , and blah, blah, bl
ah. And my mother brings the 
letter just when my husband is there -- who wa
sn™t my husband yet. So nosy wants to know. So 
here, read it. I mean, it™s nothing 
wrong what he wrote. You send th
is letter back to him. Why? 
He has no business writing you a letter. I said, he™s
 just has good wishes for us, why not?  I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
111 
 
want the letter. You don™t have th
e letter, I have -- anyway, back
 and forth and back and forth. 
And I wouldn™t send the letter ba
ck. So he says, you don™t send th
e letter back, I don™t want to 
ma rry you. I said, it™s a deal. You don™t want to
 ma rry me , fi ne. Okay, we™ll talk tonight, you 
come  over to his family -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and we™ll see what his cousin
 -- he relied a lot on his cousi
n, older cousin, see what he says. 

I said, okay, take -- I brought the letter, I let Ge
orge read it. Ge orge said, nothing wrong with the 
letter, you know. And he is hysterica
l with this letter. So I said, 
here George, you keep the letter, 
but I™m not sending it back. Anyway, said 
goodnight, you want to go -- okay, I™ll see you 
tomorrow, ma ybe. So t hen -- 

Q: He said -- he said ma ybe?  Oh, you said ma ybe. 

A: And then in the morning he called me  up and 
aggravates me yet about the letter. So I said, 
you better stop, don™t want to hear it, you want 
to get ma rried? Yeah, but you should, you know, 
it™s not right, and blah, blah, blah. So I hung 
up on him. The morning of our wedding, I hung up 
on him, oka y?  But I knew he was gonna come
 around, so I did get dressed, you know?  Can you 
see the pi ctur e of all that? 

Q: Yes. 

A: So anyway, I got dressed, and you™re not familiar with New York, are you? 

Q: Yes, I am, sure. 

A: Ye -- are you?  We ll, we got ma rried in Brooklyn. 

Q: It™s where I was born. 

A: Yeah?  Oh good --  

Q: Queens. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
112 
 
A: -- so you know. On Pi tkin Avenue, in -- in 
a place called Little Orient al. Very nice, you know, 
not -- they had everything ready 
for me , I didn™t have to get a -- 
a rabbi, not a hazzan, a singer, a 
music, they arranged everything. The food, wonder
ful, kosher from top to bottom, and so cheap, 
you know. Now it™s -- would be like 
nothing, you know, but for us it was sort of expensive, you 
know. So anyway we had this wonderful we
dding, and the guy said, well you don™t have to 
worry because we had guards at the door if the 
gr oom wants to run away. I said, ﬁI think you 
mi ght need guards for me, not for him.ﬂ 
Oh. So anyway, we got ma rried, obviously. 
Q: Right. 
A: Had a lot of fights in between, but we™re still here. 

Q: Yeah, so you kept each other on your toes. 

A: We kept each other on our 
toes, and what can I tell you? 
Q: And you were close with
 his mother and father? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: I don™t know -- 

Q: So she was very happy. 

A: Yes. My -- my parents came over to Kansas City
 and they usually brought the kids with them, 
my nephews. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah, and they came. Even on the bus, you know, 
couldn™t afford really to fly them, four or 

five of them, so Mother was schlepping on th
at bus, poor woma n. She wanted to come , you 
know, and be with me  too. And -- 

Q: Guess it must have been hard for her for you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
113 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- to be out in Kansas City. 

A: Especially we got ma rried in
 July, and we were supposed to move back in October, okay? 
Q: Move back to New York? 

A: Move back to New York. 

Q: And that™s -- 

A: I didn™t get my stuff out of New York, seven y
ears later. Not my sewing machine, not all the 
gifts, everything. I didn™t open anyt
hing cause I thought I™m moving back. 
Q: I see. So you sti -- 

A: Speaking of tricking. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Speaking of tricking, he ha
d no intention of moving back. 
Q: He had no intention? 
A: No. He lied through his teeth. 
Q: Really? 

A: He couldn™t leave his parents, bu
t I could leave my parents, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: And stuff like that. So -- 

Q: So did you adjust to Kansas City? 

A: I did adjust to Kansas City. 

Q: You like it now? 

A: I like Kansas City. I™m very glad I did not move back -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
114 
 
A: -- to be honest, but I 
don™t want him to know t hat. 
Q: No, we™re not going to tell him this. 
A: You™re not going to tell anybody. 

Q: No. 

A: But no, I wouldn™t change it. 

Q: And did you eventually get all 
your presents to Kansas City? 
A: I didn™t open my pres ents til I mo ved into th
e house. We  lived in an apartment for seven years 
before we build the house. 

Q: House. 

A: And then I finally got everything in the house. 

Q: And then you opened your presents? 

A: And then I opened my presents. 

Q: Did you then send thank you notes to people, or not? 
A: Most of the boxes I opened, I did send thank you notes. 
Q: You did? 

A: Yeah. I didn™t know what™s 
in them any more, you know?   
Q: This mus t  have been the longest period of time -- 

A: Very long. 

Q: -- that anyone held their wedding presents. 

A: Very long time. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I lived on this street called Tr uma n Road. 

Q: Truman?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
115 
 
A: Truman Road, which led to his house, you 
know, a little bit. He™s
 in Independence -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- you™ve heard of Independence. 

Q: Sure. 

A: And we were not -- well, we were on the sa
me  road with Truman. And we had an apartment 
there with my in-laws, of course. And they were 
very nice to me , and they loved me , and I loved 
them. Some t i me s it wasn™t always easy. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know?  It wasn™t easy for them probabl
y either. But -- you don™t have much privacy, 

that™s the only thing. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But you have a good cook. 

Q: You were sure of that. 
A: Yeah, a good cook. 
Q: And you went to work pretty muc h right away? 

A: Yeah, I did. My first job was in -- see, I neve
r worked in a factory. I always worked in New 
York, custom ma de clothes. 
And -- fine clothes, you know? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I didn™t know what a factory is. And then when
 I came he -- to Kansas City they didn™t have 
custom made stuff. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: There was only one store and they didn™t 
need anybody, you know?  Alterations I never did, I 
didn™t know. So I went to work at a factory th
at wa s ma king maternity clothes. And I started 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
116 
 
there -- was my first job there. 
I started to work there in the 
biggest heat. That year, in ™54, 
Kansas City had the biggest heat. And I™m 
in the factory, I thought
 I™d die. I didn™t 
[indecipherable] and you know, they don™t have air 
condition. The fans going, that just gave you 
a headache. It was very, very hard time  ahead. So 
I tried to, after awhile 
-- the boss was very nice 
to me , in fac t  at first, you know, he gave me  
a certain how mu ch he™s gonna pay. But then when 
he saw me , he gave me  a little more, which is go
od. And then I started to look for other jobs. But 
I just couldn™t get used to the factory work. So
 then this lady calls me , and she says, do you do 
alterations?  And th -- from the Jewish vocational 
service. I said, no, I never did alterations. We ll, 
you know how to sew?  Yes. You want to try?  
I said, I don™t know. I know
 I don™t like factory. 
Do you know how to shorten sleeves?  I said, I s
hould know how to shorten sleeve. Well, me ns™s 
sleeves. So I said, you know, I never shorten a 
ma n™s sleeve. So she says, why don™t you come  
in, try, okay?  We  need some  help, try, see how it 
works. Okay. I went to try and stayed there 15 
years. There™s no hope for me . So they wouldn™
t let me  go. Shin -- he showed me  once, you 
know, how you -- me n™s little different. But if you 
know how to sew, it™s not that difficult. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And so I wound up doing most of the wome n™ s stuff, besides po -- besides shortening sleeves 

for the me n™s coat. And they were very fond ofme, and were nice to me  except for the money, 

they were not too generous. He was a Polish ref
ugee who ma rried an Americ
an girl, Jewish girl 
in Kansas City. And he was good to me , very go
od, but the money was a different story, he was 
stingy. So then everybody said why don™t you 
go on your own, why do you have to work for 

him. And I wanted to get out, I tell you why. He
 was very nice, but he got ill, you know? And it 
upset me  that he was ill, and he was nervous. So 
I figure, ma ybe it™s time  to leave, cause he is 
not going to be able to work much longer, and 
besides, you know, I just -- ma ybe they™re right, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
117 
 
ma ybe I should go on my own. So then a friend of 
mi ne said that she would go in with me , that 
she would, you know. So -- and that™s how I opened 
up a business. We  found a spot, a store, and 
we open it up, and of course anybody that came  to
 s -- to s -- him and say where™s Evie, he didn™t 
know where I went. Cause he knew, but I mean, 
he didn™t know. He would say, I don™t know. I 
don™t know where she is. He was very, very upset
 that I left, you know. Because he could go on 
vacation and leave me , you know, he -- he trusted me
, and so it hur -- I 
understand that he was 
upset that I left, but after a
ll, I had to live too. So I went
 into business, 29 years.  
Q: 29 years. So were you ma king custom clothes then? 

A: No, alterations. 

Q: Alterations still, right. 

A: I did a few -- I snuck a few custom clothes in, 
but it™s hard to do both. You have to do one or 
the other because you need different spots, and 
a different table, different machine. And you 
need too mu ch patience, which at the end I™m 
not -- I didn™t have any more. But I still have 
enough patience, people still come  to me . See, the tr
ouble is with custom ma de clothes, they see 
a paper, you know a ma gazine, and they think, I 
want that, they think 
they™re gonna look like the 
magazine. 

Q: Right. 

A: We ll, they™re not going to look like the ma gazine. 
So then they start to pi
ck. I think this sleeve 
is a quarter of an inch, or ma ybe just an ei
ghth of an inch too long. And they ma ke you, you 
know, do it over for nothing. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
118 
 
A: You know, just because it™s cu
stom ma de, so they think they 
have to. So I said, no, I don™t 
want to make anything custom made. When th
ey buy the clothes, they know what they™re 
getting, you know, they can see. I™d rather do 
alter -- which I never thought I would like. 
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: Never thought I would like. Bu
t I liked it for awhile, but then
 when I started to not have 
patience, I said it™s time to retire. 

Q: Right. 29 years is a long time. 

A: Cause I don™t -- and 15 years in [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So, they™r e still comi ng to me. 

Q: I bet. 

A: And I only kept -- I only 
kept the cream of the crop. 
Q: I would come  to you. 
A: I bet you would. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I wish you could. 

Q: In a mi nute. 

A: Wi sh you could. So, you know, th
ey still trust my work -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and -- but I don™t want to 
-- I do it, but don™t rush me.  
Q: Right. 

A: You know?  I been rushed all my
 life, I don™t want to be rushe
d. No, I give you a week. I said, 
that™s rushing. They™re
 teasing me , you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
119 
 
Q: When did you start to think of yourself as 
a survivor of the Holocaust?  Wa s it late, was it 
right away? 
A: Right -- 

Q: Away. 

A: I think. 

Q: Did you talk about it? 

A: No, not too much. 

Q: No. 

A: Not too much. 

Q: Recently have you t-talked about it more? 

A: Well, I™ve talked about it more si
nce the book came out in Kansas City. 
Q: And wha t  book is that? 

A: That™s the book, it™s called, ﬁF
rom the Heart.ﬂ Our pictures -- 
all the people that are in the 
book, the pictures are on the front page. 
Mine is the only colored picture -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- so there I am, as a bride, see?  And Johnny™
s next -- Zdenko™s next to
 me . And t hen you turn 
it around what we are now, oh my gosh, okay?  They 
had to do that. And inside, whoever™s in the 

book, there™s a story, you know, to the -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- what they interviewed, you know. I told you 
the one that interviewed me  just wanted to 
know about my childhood -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and she didn™t understand 
that I didn™t have a childhood. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
120 
 
Q: Right. 
A: You know. So I couldn™t really 
express the way I wanted to e
xpress. And -- but that™s what 
happened. 

Q: And wha t  was that, w-wa -- was that in the 90™s? 

A: That™s when they -- that™s
 how I started to think more. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: It was about 10 years ago. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That that started. And then they had a big 
get together, celebrating 
10 years of this book, and 
everything. In fact, Zenie came with her husba
nd, and my nephew, my first nephew and his 
girlfriend, because after 35 years they decided to
 divorce, and so he came with his girlfriend. 
And that was wonderful, to have my fa mily there.  

Q: Oh yeah, sure. 
A :  T h a t  me a n t  s o  mu c h  t o  me .  
Q: Right. 

A: They gave us a beautiful, beautiful dinner,
 all the Holocaust survivors. And Dudu Fisher, you 
know Dudie Fisher? 

Q: I know the name. 

A: He™s an Israeli singer. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He came to entertain. Wonderful. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
121 
 
A: Just wonderful. And like I sai
d, it meant so much that they
 came. And so that™s when I 
started, 10 years ago to think. And 
then certain things come  to me
 and I said, my God, I  almost 
forgot that. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know?  And things like 
that. You know. That™s it. 
Q: We ll, I want to thank you very mu ch, for 
comi ng from Kansas City and for being who you 
are. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: It™s been a pleas
ure to be with you. 

A: You™re sweet, thank you. –This is a picture in 
Vienna. It is I, my brother, and my little 
cousin, who we just were crazy about. He was just
 a little --  this pict
ure really doesn™t do him 
justice because he was so much cuter. But he 
ma kes a funny face, and I think the sun was shining 
in some how. But he is one that got 
killed, they did not let him live. 
Q: And wha t  year do you think this was? 

A: I think it must have been ™39. ™39, because 
I think my dad was gone by then, and we went to 
see. ™38 or ™39, I™m not sure. 

Q: And this picture? 

A: This is my brother and I, when we got to 
Genoa. So that was before his Bar Mitzvah, so I 

guess -- we figured out yester
day when was that, ™40? 
Q: No -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- he was born in ™29 -- 

A: It™s ™27 he was born. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
122 
 
Q: Twen -- oh, ™27. 
A: 1927, so must have been ™40, that™s just 13. 

Q: Right. 

A: 1940. We™d -- had just gotten to Genoa, and I th
ink my parents wanted 
us to have a picture 
like that. 

Q: And this picture? 

A: This is when we got to Genoa. Again, it was 
done the same  time as the one before. It™s my 

parents, me in the mi ddle, and my mother™s in
 the mi ddle a-at the botto
m.  And on one side the 
bigger woman, yeah, she was the landlady, and ther
e was a ma id there. And they took very nice 
care of us. They were wonderful to us. We  lived
 there long as we were
 in Genoa. I can still 
reme mber the name  of the street, which was via 
Goito. So, little after that
, started bombardments , 
and things we re a little bit more diffi
c ult. But they were so good to us. 

Q: And this picture? 
A: This picture is my brother in Pari, teaching th
ese wonderful girls, and one is prettier than the 
other, which he loved, teaching them German. They
 had nothing else to do, they were comi ng to 
Pari to get away from the big city™s bombardme nts
 and so on. I™m not sure what town they came  
from, whether it was just as close as Siena 
or Florence, or ma ybe even Pisa, I don™t know. 
Anyway, there nothing else to do, so th
ey thought they would learn German. 
Q: And this shot? 

A: And this is me , and my parent
s, and my brother, and I reme mb
er my out fit being gray with a 
pink blouse, and was so pretty. And it was a -- 
a Jewish holiday. Of course, there was no -- you 
know, no synagogue or anything, but my mother al
ways ma de sure, some how she ma naged to 
give us some new clothes on holidays. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498  
123 
 
Q: And this was in Pari? 
A: And this was in Pari, yeah. She liked that wall
, I guess, she always took 
pictures on that wall. 
And we were all together, and that was always th
e ma in thing, we stuck together. Ma -- one was 
worrying about the other.  

Q: And these pictur es? 

A: The bigger one is my mo m and I in Pari. 
Just taking pictures for no reason. I guess he had 
some extra film in the camera. And th
e other picture is my brother and I. 
Q: Sa me  wa ll. 

A: Sa me  wa ll. That wall was fa mous.
