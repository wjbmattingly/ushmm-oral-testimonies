The  date  is  April 2, 1992 and we are  s pea king wi
th Monique  Goodrich i n Br
ookline, Massachuset ts.  
Ms. Goodri c h, c oul d you tell  us  your
 name at  the ti me  of 
the  war ,  your  da te of birt h, your  pl ace  of  
birth and anything you possi
bly can about 
your fa mily backgrou
nd and your childhood?
 
 
I wa s known as Monique Jackson.  
I was born in Pari s, France.  I 
was bor n in October  29, 1937.  
My pare nts- - my fat her 's na me was Charles, he wa
s born i n  Russia , i n Ve sitosk ( ph) (c.10); my  
mother  wa s bor n i n  Pola nd.  The y  both e migr ated to
 France when t hey wer e
 young.  My 
father did  
some  st udie s .  They were  bot h or
phans of the first Wo rld Wa r.  
 
 
So they met in France?
 
 
They met  in France, yes.
  The y  wer e  prett y yo u ng  whe n  I  wa
s bor n, l  I gues s. 
 My mo ther was 
twenty years old wh en I wa s born. 
 My mot her  never  reall y  had a 
good family.  She wa s raised, I 
gue ss, by he r sister .  J ean
nette , who is  dea d now, t old me  that  s h
e is t he one  who t ook he r out of t h e  
orphanage because her parent s died 
during the war.  I  t hink typhoid. 
 So my mother  never  knew her  
pare nts  and s he wa s r aise d by her  gr a ndmother , 
by her siste rs; she  was 
shunted back and forth.
 
 
All in Poland?
 
 
In Pol and and i n Pari s.  My fath
er was more  or  l ess the  sa me .  He
 came from a larg
e  fa mi l y  and he  
has  mor e re collect ion of his  pare nts but  he  was  a l
so orphaned during the 
war and didn't know his  
parents.  No, he knew th
em a little bit, he kn
ew morehis oldest
 sister, I think he
 knew.  Her name 
was Emma; I think she 
raised him.  But he lost 
his whole fa mily except fo r a 
brother that was left in 
the United States.  That 's
 one of the r easons we di d come t o 
t h e Unite d Sta t es, be cause his brot her  
wa s here , Sa m.
 
 
You don't know a nyt hing about t he  reli gious ba
c kgr ound of the  fa mil y 
or anything, do you?
 
 

The religion?  My father certainly
 was well- ver s ed i n reli gion.  
He knew the prayers, there must  
have be en some ort hodox.  But he didn't practi ce.  
He ga ve up t he reli gion, 
certai nly.  I don't know 
if it was before the 
war  or  during t he war  but I  t hi nk he  gave  up all  reli gion.
 
 
Wh en he wa s in Paris, yo
u s aid he  wa s st udying.
 
 
He  did study some  engineering, I 
t hink he  did, for  a while
, but then he ran out 
of mo ney and he had 
to go to work.  He  told us lots
 of stories of how--I 
gue ss  there  were  a gr oup of the m--t hey use d  to  
run out of mone y a nd how t hey us
ed to try and get the baker to 
gi ve t he m some mone y and how 
they would t ake  the  herri ng and split  i t
 so they could have s o mething t o 
eat .  Lot s of s t or ies li ke  that .  
 
 
Do you know anythi ng abou
t your  parent s ' ba sic  ed
ucat ion.  Did t hey go 
to public school system 
there?
 
 
My mothe r  we nt t o publ ic
 sc hool.  My poor fat her
, he  di dn't know re all y, Russi an.  He studie d i n 
Yiddis h.  I don't t hink he  kne w Hebre w but he stud
ied in Yiddish.  Hi s mo th
er tongue wa s Yi ddish. 
His  mo the r  ton gue  wa s Yid dis h  a
nd he  c oul d write Yi ddi sh. Ever ythi
ng else  was  ver y di ffic ult. 
Languages didn't come  very easily 
to hi m s o  he  c a me t o  
Fr ance, had a har d ti
me  wit h  Fre nch  a nd  
when he became a little fluent
 in French, he went to 
Spain.  He ended up in 
Spain during the war, in 
a camp there.  So when he
 became a little fl ue
nt in Spain, he ca
me back to France. 
 From France, we 
ca me t o t his  country.  M y  poor  fat her wa s al wa
ys  s pea king i n al l ki nds  of di ffer ent  la ngua ges .
 
 
I see.  That's interestin
g.  What  ca n you t ell me  a bout your 
home?  Do you reme mber?  Were you 
extre me ly young?  
 
 
Be fore the  war, I  do not r e me mbe r  a n ythi ng be cause
 I was t w o yea rs old when the  war starte d.  M y 
earliest recollections are of the li
ttle town in the Pyrene
es in the south of Fr
ance in the Medii,  
Nei chta uber called St . La urent  De Ne
ste.  This is where I spent quit e
 a few year s of t he war .  Those  
are my earliest
 recollections. 
 
 
Since you can't tell me first 
hand, can you tell me  wh at ha
ppe ned  a nd how you got  ther e ?
 
 
In 1939 when 
the Ger mans cr ossed over t o Fr ance, the famil y
 starte d to go- -they wa
nted to go to the  
free zone of France.  
My mother--I forgot the 
exact  st ory how it  went--
but  she knew so meone or 
some body t o ld he r to go do
wn to t he Pyr enees and 
I thi nk the  govern ment  helped t he mother s a n d  

the chil dren to escape.  They es
ca ped, the y  ende d up in the Pyr ene
es with quite a 
few members--her 
sister  was there wit h her  famil y. 
 There were about some twenty persons, I think, some Jewish 
people who were in 
that particular town, in th
at little town, ended up in 
St. Laurent De Neste.  I 
talked to her last night, she me
ntioned that they were strafed wh
en they wer e es
capi ng and they 
ended up i n that s ma ll t o wn. They
 t o ok t he tr ain and t he y e nded up--it wa s about maybe t we nty or  
thirty miles from Towl 
(ph) (c .62)  whi ch i s t he bi ggest  cit y.  
 
 
So whe n you got t here , di d t he i ndi vi dual
s  hi de pe ople or, what happe ned e x actly?
 
 
The Fr enc h, if you rec al l , ha d a 
c orr oborating governme nt
.  Li fe wa s ve r y di
fficult but the town 
itself was very helpful.  
My mother always tells th
e story how they used to
 ma ke little baskets down  
there.  My mother 
says I used to go off in
to this little town and I 
would come ba
ck. Somebody 
would give  me  a  bas ket  they woul d 
put eggs in there or milk and re
ally keep my mother supplied. 
The y were e xtre mel y hel p ful;  ve get ables--.
 
 
There wasn't  a hu
ge short age in 
these areas, or--?
 
 
Not  whe n I wa s with my  moth er.  I d on 't re me mb er 
being hungry, no.  It seems that the town really 
helped my mother and my 
fat her  s urvive; t he  ot her  pe opl e who wer e t here  al so.
 
 
Do you re me mber what  it  looke d li ke?
 
 
Absolutely, yes.
 
 
Give me  a ny possi ble  de s cripti ons  that  yo
u ha ve  and be as spe ci fic  a s you li ke.
 
 
The town was a beautiful 
little town.  I remember it; 
it was imbedded in my
 mind.  I 
could never 
forget it .  As a matt er of fact  
wh en  we  we nt bac k t here ,  ab o ut t e
n years ago, my  husband and I, I 
took him exactly to whereit was.  Because it was in
 the Pyrenees and becaus
e it was so close to the  
Spa nis h boar der, there  wa s a  sort 
of like a Spanis
h flair t o it .  
 
 
Did t hey s pe ak Ba sque  there?
 
 

Ye s, some  of the  pe ople  spoke  
Basque.  As  a matter of fact, I 
s poke Ba sque, I le arned a  tongue  
down ther e t hat was Bas que-- ver y Spanis h.  But I forg
ot it all , unfortunatel y.  The reason I forget it  
all is because there's a defi nite so
uthern accent t o France.  When 
we went back to Paris after the 
war , I was r eally ma de  fun of s o I dropped it a s  
qui ckl y as I could.  It
 was like all small towns 
whether they be French or  whet he
r they be Spanish, they
 have  what  they call  a  pla ss  (ph.)( c.88 )  
which is the center of
 t he  town.  Ther e 's  us uall y t h e c hurc hes , 
the town hall, very si milar al most to 
the American town.  Fr om th
at  pl ass radiat es all  t he streets of th
e town.  In the cent
er of town, there 
was al so a buildi ng wher e the people 
use d t o put  hay.  I re me mber th
e y use d t o stac k ha y t here  a nd  
we used to play i n t her e 
a nd ha ve  fun.  The s mell  of
 ha y was j us t  incr edi ble .
 
 
You pla ye d wit h j ust  the  regul ar kids?
 
 
Yes, as a matter of fact, Zh
e bair( ph) (c.92) wa s one of the m a nd he 
is in one of those 
picture s the re.  
I fo und them afterwards.  
We  had a house that was 
a three story house, very 
primitive, actually.  All  
the houses were built; they
 were at least hu
ndreds of years old with ve
ry, very thick walls.  The  
mai n room would be where t here would a coal st ove
 and then the bedr oo ms  upst airs.  That 's wher e 
we  lived and on top of the house wa
s a huge  bal cony.  It
 wasn't as big as I 
r e me mbe r  be caus e  I w a s  
a s ma ll girl  a nd everyt hing see me d  bi g but  fr om t h
e top of the balcony, you 
could see the Pyrenees, 
the mountains.  It was 
ver y pretty, I us ed t o pla y up ther e a  l ot.
 
 
Did t he people in the t o wn--I assu
me t hey knew yo
u were Jewish?
 
 
I think so.  As 
you will see, they
 knew that we 
were Jewish.  
 
 
Your  br othe r  was n 't  born then?   
 
 
No .
 
 
So  you slept---?
 
 
We ll, as I begin to unfold
 the story, you will see 
what happens.  We lived in
 this little town.  It was  
in the  free  z one  but  it  was  not  r
eall y  that  safe.  We never  reall y 
knew who wa s coll
aborating and if 
my fat her  woul d be denounc ed.  
After a while, the mayo
r, Mr . Couque bert , wh
o ha d t wo da ughters , 
helped my mother .  She was friendly with hi s wife
.  The whole fa mily was 
friendly and he told her 
that the day they would co
me for  my  fat her  th at h e  wo uld  let  he
r know.  He  had to
 be very careful 

because agai n there was a coll aborat
i n g governme nt.  As  thi ngs be ga n 
t o be  ver y di ffic ul t, t here  was 
in t hese  ol d buil dings , t h ey had, since  ther e wa s no 
re fr iger ation, t he y had l i ke a cl oset , a ve ry thic k 
closet  whe re  the y would kee p t he goods .  You kn
ow, the butter and the 
perishables and it would  
kee p t he m quite  cool.  M y brot her  
wa s bor n i n '41 so this wa s a bout 
'4 2,  '43  ma yb e,  
when it  became-
- my mother  didn't want  peopl
e to know that my  father
 was in the house.  He 
would sta y  in t he house  
but anytime anybody would co
me to the house, he wo
uld go into that little cl
oset.  They had put an 
ar moire  in fr ont  it a nd he  woul d hi de there .  But  
my brot her  would c all, " Pa-
pa, pa-pa" back there, 
so it bec a me  ver y di fficult for hi m t o  hide.  Across 
the str eet, there  was li ke a bar n, nothi ng li ke a  
barn that you would t hin
k of now, but like an ol d buildi ng wh
ere t he a ni mal s would be kept .  M y  
father very often would go
 t here  duri ng t he  da y or  
at night and hide there so
 he wo uldn't be home. 
My mother tells me that the Germ
ans did come into the 
town one time. 
 I was at my 
little friend's  
house .  He r fat her  ha d tr ucks whi c h of c our se c o uld 
not  be used t hat  ti me  bec aus e t he y di dn't ha ve  
gasoline.  We would play in the tr
uc ks and t hey had put some s wi
ngs there and we'd swing.  One 
day t he Ger mans came in and t hey
 routed all t he men.  There 
were some that  were Mackee  
(ph)(c.138), the Resistance.  We  we
re very scared.  I was 
very, very scared at th e time.  They killed,  
they rounded up and s o me of t he m 
tri ed t o es cape and the y r ounde d 
up t he one s who tri ed t o es cape,  
they were shot.  Ther e wa
s the fa ther of the baker 
wa s s hot  de a d a nd a fe w ot
her s wer e shot .  They 
put all t he men i n t his l a plass  (c .141)  where  I 
t ol d you wher e  ther e was  a  buil di ng  where pe opl e  
coul d get  together .  The y let the m go a fte r a  whil e.
 
 
Did you ha ve a s ens e--at  this poi
nt di d you under stand a nyt hi ng t h
at was goi ng on, a sens e of the  
danger?
 
 
The r e  was  a  s ens e  of da nger  but  I  r eally didn't  
underst and what  was goin
g on.  As the hidden 
children understood, we  kne
w instinctively that  we couldn't call attention to oursel ves, that  we  had 
to be very good and obey
 and do what we we
r e t old t o do.  Because af
ter a while, my mother  felt  
that it was too dangerous.
  She talks about the br
own Jews coming around a
nd telling them to hide 
the chil dren, at least  to 
save the children if they couldn't sa
ve t he ms elves.  So I e n ded up i n a  
convent for a while
 with t he sister s. That 
was a ver y mis era ble t i me .
 
 
How ol d wer e you?
 
 
I was four.
 
 
Do  you reme mb er this?
 
 
Ver y dist antl y, ye s.
 

 
Do you wa nt  to ta
lk about it at all?
 
 
Yes, I can talk about it b
ecause I did go back 
and visit .  Some of t he ho
rror  was wor ked out.  They  
had a n orphana ge, they ran an or ph
anage t here and so I  was just  a 
me mber of the children in the 
orphanage .  It was ver y, very regi
mented.  You got up at  a certain 
hour a n d you went  i n the c hapel  
and prayed.  You ate at 
a certain hour and you we nt
 to the bathroom
 at  a certai n 
hour and a four-
year- old c hil d, it wa s ver y 
difficult besides being aw
ay fr om my parents.  
 
 
You knew that they
 were still there?
 
 
My pare nts?
 
 
Ye s.  Or  di d you--?
 
 
Hard to say.  Hard to sa y what I felt.  I think what
 happened is that I sort  
of withdrew into myself. 
The  only thi ng t hat  I r e me mber  vi vi dly is having 
to go to the bathroom a
ll the time an
d not being 
able  t o go and bei ng very, ver y  a f
raid at night.  Again I wo uld have
 to go to the ba
throom and I wa s 
afr aid to get up and go.
 
 
I 'm sorr y we  coul dn't l e t 
you go when 
you got  her e.
 
 
That's  okay.  I wa s scared, I wa s 
al ways scared.  I al wa
ys knew that there wa
s danger  and I di dn't 
know  what  t he danger was.  Bein
g a wa y fr om my par e nt s wa s als o 
very-- .  You kne w, insti nctively 
that  the r e was da nger  be caus e my fat her  was  hi dden
.  I was shushed, I'm su
re, all the time.  Ther e 
wa s danger , it was  i m minent at al
l times and I didn't know wh y. 
 
 
Did t he nuns  know t hat  you were  Je wish?
 
 
I don't know.  I 'd ha ve to as k my 
mother if they knew.  My mother  
s ays  I  didn't  sta y very long.  To 
me, it seeme d like a very lo
ng time .  But when I back to visit th
em, to visit about te
n ye ars a go, that 
wa s t he  la st stop I  ma de  beca use  t h
at  was the most painful one to do.  That was really miserabl e. 
The y under s tood ri ght  a wa y what had happe ned 
to me and they proceedin
g t o gi ve  me fl owers  
because they had changed the pl ace t o
tally.  I t  was bri ght 
and i t was cheer f ul where it had been star k 

and dark.  There were fl owers ever
ywhere and so they pr
oc e ede d t o show me a
ll the pictures that 
they had;  the chil dren t hat  were ther e.
 
 
Were they the same people?
 
 
Not  t he sa me sisters.  They we ren't t h e sa me  sister s.
 
 
But they knew the legacy?
 
 
Right, they did know.  So
 fro m there, I was there 
by myself.  As my brothe
r got a little bit older, I  
think my br other was a bout a year
 and a hal f  old, a ccor di n g to 
my mother t he br own Je ws or  
some body c a me and sai d hi
de your children.  Th ey 
took us away and my  pa
rents weren't supposed 
to know where and it was the most
 horri ble plac e on eart h.  The r e were t wo ot her c hi l dren wi th us 
that came fr om the town 
and I forgot  to ask my 
mother  what  their names 
wer e .  One o f th e m was  
name d Lo uie, who didn't survive.  
He  finally e nde d up being deport e
d anyway, and his brother.  We 
wer e at a t own, the name I do
 n o t  re me mb er and my  mo t h er 
does not reme mb er.  We were 
absolutely--we really 
di dn't ha ve enough food to 
eat  there.  It  was the mo st horri ble pl ace;  we wer e  
constant ly punis he d.  I  wa s punis h
ed for l osing a barrett e;  I went  
without supper.  It wa s really 
pretty a w ful.  My mot her  ha d a 
drea m tha t  we  di dn't have enough 
fo od  a nd  that  we  wer e  not  we ll  
and she woke up my  father one ni
ght and she sa ys  we  ha ve got  to 
go get t h e chil dre n.  He sa ys no 
we  shouldn't; she says if
 you don't come  with me, 
I'll go by my self.  So  th
ey we nt to Taub ( ph)  
(c.196)  to t h e Red Cr oss who had pl
aced us.  She insi sted that they
 tell her wher e we wer e.  They  
fi nall y di d a nd she ca me  and got us. I re me mber  
she  was a b solut ely so 
upset when she saw us 
beca use  we  had gotte n s o t hin and-- .
 
 
You re me mber bei n
g at  t his place?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
This wa s a home, with people?
 
 
It wa s a  home ,  ye s, wit h pe ople .  
 It  was a pri vate home.  It  was 
not  an i nstit ution or  anyt hing like 
that.  It was a private ho
me .  We  we nt to school . 
 I remember we ha
d to walk quite 
a fe w miles to go 
to s chool .  
 
 

Wa s t his  your first  e xperi ence  in sc hool?
 
 
No, because I had started in St . La
ure nt de  Ne ste  i n kinder gart en. 
 M a y b e,  I ' m mes s
ing up--I think 
we we re in  s cho ol th ere , I '
m not sure.  I remember we 
use d t o dig for r oots in th
e soil to see, to eat. 
We  used to go t o pe ople  
and ask for food, i f I re
member  corr ectly. 
 My mother tell
s me  that t he  
people , whe n s he final ly got  there  
to get us , t hat t he nei ghbors  ca me
 and t o ld t he m how ha ppy t hey  
were that they came for us
 a nd got us out  of the re.
 
 
What  ha ppe ned fro m t ha t  point?
 
 
After that, I don't remember if it
's t hi s one or the  one be fore- -I 
went on a farm, Labastide it was  
called and I stayed there al
so for a fe w months.  It 
was in the foothills of th
e Pyrenees on a farm. 
Even as miserable as I wa s, becaus e how coul d I 
ever be happy being awa y
 fr om my  parents, I 
kne w that  it wa s a bea uti ful place .  I  coul d re me mber
 walking out in the Spri
ng and havi ng just a  
field of narci ssuses as far  as th
e eye coul d see.  Becau
se it was the foot hill s 
of Pyr enees, t he roads 
were very steep.  Everyb
ody would l eave the bicycle at t he 
far m and t he  onl y 
wa y you could go 
down was to walk down to the town
.  The food wa s there, it wa s fa
r m food, but  the  
fo od  wa s t h ere .
 
 
So  you weren't starving?
 
 
No, I wa sn't starvi ng
 but I was  not ha ppy.
 
 
We re t her e other kids?
 
 
The re  was  one  girl .  I  found out 
whe n I  went  bac k:  her  na me  was  La ha ns el ( ph) (c.220); s he  wa s  
adopte d.  She and I  were  prett y go od fri ends.  My job, sinc e I wa s 
four , fi ve ye ars old, on t he far m  
was to keep the birds aw
ay fr om t he chickens.  
They ha d t hes e pre y bird
s that woul d c o me down,  
circle and ci rcle and then come do
wn a nd pic k c hicken.  I  woul d st ay wi th a big stic k a nd i f  I s a w 
the m circli ng, I woul d s t
art shouting and wave my
 stick but once in a wh
ile, they would get a 
chicken anyway.
 
 
They wouldn't try to a
tta ck you, woul d t hey?
 
 
No .
 

 
Good.  You we nt t o school wh
ile you wer e t here , a l so?
 
 
No, I didn't  go t o s chool .  Maybe, 
it  wa s duri ng the  summer , I ' m not  
sure.  I don't reme mb er going to 
school  the r e.
 
 
Where  was  your  br other?
 
 
My br other  must  ha ve  been youn
g.  Maybe I've got it
 out  of se quenc e b
ecause t her e I  was b y  
my self.  Wh en I went to that ot
her  place where I  t old you, where 
I  wa s  s o miser a ble ,  my br othe r 
wa s wit h  me .
 
 
We re your parent s i n t he vicini ty all t his t i me?
 
 
They weren't too far.
  Wh en I was a t  Labasti d
e, it wa s the si ste r  of our
 nei g hbor, Mada me  Caze au, 
this is a picture of her.  It wa
s  just a  questi on of sa ving--ac c ord
ing to my mother
, it was just a 
que stion of t r ying t o kee p me  a w
ay from t he house.  I n
 ca se  somet hing happen
ed, that I wo uld be 
save d.
 
 
Do you re me mber any i nc i dent s at  
this time, Nazis or any bombings or
 a nyt hing, did anyt hing go on  
at this time?
 
 
Bo mb ings, no.  I never h
eard any bombings.  The on
ly time  that  I sa w them
 whe n  the y  would dr op  
their--I can remember; t hey 
woul d come down t o the town t o La
bastide, into t he t o wn and t hey 
wo uld drop off their bicycl
es.   I  re me mb er bei ng  i n 
the fi ve , you know how; t he se old far ms--t here 's 
just one bi g room, with t he big 
fi repl ace, literal l y how you see it in
 Pl ymouth planati o n--that 's how 
they cooked on an open 
fire.  I can reme mber when the Germ
ans--I  could neve
r distinguish the 
di fference between t he Ger mans or
 the gendarme, the po
lice, whenever  t hey 
appeared, I wo uld go 
on the corner of t he fireplace and 
try to make myself as small as I 
c oul d.  I  was  al wa ys  afr a id, I wa s 
very much a fra id.  
 
 
I 'm sure.  Were t here ot her 
playmates at this time?
 
 
No, I don't  reme
mber  any playmates at  all.
 

 
How long--you were  only ther
e for j ust a few mont hs?
 
 
I think it was just a fe w 
mont hs t hat  I wa s t here .
 
 
Where  were  you a ft er war ds?
 
 
I think it was the farm, th
e Re d Cross, the convent and then for 
a while , i nstea d of sl e eping--a ft er a 
while my  mother  said if we perish, we  peri sh  to
gether.  Wh at I woul d do 
is  I woul d not  sle ep at  
home  at night.  She would send 
me  t o the neighbor 's  house a nd I  
wo uld sleep wi th their daughter, 
Huni( ph)( c.268) .  Again I  used t o 
wake up in the mi ddle of
 the night and I used 
t o get  frighte ne d.  I  
coul d he ar t he  mice  in t he  walls  
and I  couldn't sl eep.   It  was a ti
me  of al wa ys  being frighte ne d  and 
didn't  know why.  I  t hi n k we  could 
f eel  it  from t he adults but  t hey 
ne ver  would tell  us anythi ng s o  
we really--t his fear was not  know
n, wa s an unknown fear. Which ac
tually made it
 worse because 
we  ne ver  k n e w wher e it  wa s c o min g 
fr om.  My mother got 
false identity papers fr om the policeman 
who was helping her. At th
e beginning--my father s
till talked until he died, ab
out the garden that he 
had in ba ck of the house .   I we nt
 back to see that  garden; I coul d 
re me mber  it so vi vidl y.  One  ni ght , 
they di d c o me  for  my fath
er  and my mot her  was to
l d--.  M o nsie ur Couquebe
rt sent his wi fe during 
the da y a nd t old her  that my fat her
 s h oul d not  be  home t hat  ni ght.  
He  wen t  acros s ,  
where I told you, 
acros s  the  hous e and he  wat che d the m;  i n t he  mi ddle  
of the night they came 
for hi m.   It  was no  
longer safe for him to stay ther
e.  What they did is, I'm sure 
you've he ard of the  Basse ur, ( ph )  
(c.287)  the people who would ta ke
 t he Jews from Fr ance to Spai
n  whe r e it wa s s u
ppos ed to be  
sa fer?
 
 
Smugglers, kind of.
 
 
That 's exact l y what  
happened.  They took the me
n and took th
em over to Spain a
nd my  father ended 
up in Spai n.
 
 
What  di d he do in 
Spai n, do you know?
 
 
He  wa s  in  a  ca mp , what  
they call a concentratio
n ca mp , in Miranda.  Th
ey struggled but they 
survived and we were left in the 
Pyrenees by ourselves with my  mo th
er .  What my fat her  used to do 
in order to earn his livi
ng; he worked in leather.
  When they would kill th
e cows, the oxen, he would 
take t he le at her a nd t an i t .  He would ma ke poc
ke tbooks .  M y bag was __
_______(c .300) from my  
father.  As a matter of 
fact, when I back to this little town te
n years ago, this Hu
nee (ph)(c.302) who 

I used to sleep with, she showed
 me a nd I  don't ha ve  a  pi ctur
e of it here, sh
e showed me a 
pocketbook that my  fa
ther made for her.
 
 
That's  interesting.  So you
r father got to Spain and 
then your mother
 came to the fa
r m a nd took you 
out , is  t hat what ha ppe ne d?
 
 
Then we stayed with her.
 
 
Wh er e  was  t h i s ?
 
 
Still in St. Laurent De Neste.  Ho
wever, the twenty 
people that were there wi
th us who--and I wasn't  
really t hat  much aware of them--I
 was awar e of my mother 's si ster
 and her  hus ba nd in Marcel  but  I  
wa sn't a w are  of anybody 
else for  so me rea son.
 
 
I was going to ask yo
u, di d t hey associ ate wit h one
 anot her  or  was it  da ngerous?
 
 
There was a lot of--my mo ther
 tells me that they were
 not very nice to her,
 as fa r as the Je wish 
people that were there.
 
 
Wh y?
 
 
I don't know.  They we
re j ust cliquis h, you
 know, unfortunately.
 
 
Interesting t hat i n every situati on that  ---.
 
 
The y  de cide d t hat  whe n  it got  to be t oo da ngerous 
and they decided that they
 wer e goi ng to Spai n,  
my br other wa s too young 
t o go, t o cros s the Pyrenee s, so Laba
sti de 's ba sseur (? ? )  (322) t hat he 
would come  bac k for  her  and we we
re  le ft behi nd and eve r ybody le ft. 
 As i t  turned out , this bas seur  
(c.325)  wor k ed-- what my  mot her ne
ver understood is that
 t he  me n we nt  fir st a nd the y ma de  it, he  
took them there.  
But the others, the rest of 
them, they were de
livered i nto t he Ger ma ns' hands an d 
so t he y al l perished.
 
 

Oh , G__.  And so by chance 
you just didn't 
go with them.
 
 
We  didn't go beca use  my  br ot her  wa
s too young to go
.  My mother 's sist er, 
her  hus band, when t he y  
were in the mountains, the German
s ca me upon t he m.  Un
cle Jack was behind.  He  wa sn't  with his 
wi fe so he went to go wit h his 
wi fe, t o pr otect t he m a nd his son an
d at t hat  poi nt he  wa s shot.  He  
died right  there and then.
 
 
Did t he smuggler  get kill ed also? 
 
 
He was the-- the Resist ance 
got  hi m.  He  was  s hot .
 
 
So they were  betr aye d?   
 
 
They were betrayed.  He got
 mo ney fr om the Jews  and he
 got  mone y fr om the Ger ma ns .
 
 
Wa it, he  was  coll aborati n g wi
th the Germans and the Resistance went after hi m, I see.
 
 
Yes, the Resistance got after hi
m.  His wife, th
ere was a woman there, my
 mother was telling me 
last night, t h ere was a woman i n 
the town who arranged 
all this.  They got af
ter her too.  They  
sha ved her head, I  under s tand.
 
 
The  Resi sta n ce?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
Was t her e much resistance acti vit
y i n t his t o wn, do you know?
 
 
Evidently, ther
e wa s, ye s.
 
 
Wa s your mother  a war
e of it?  Did they 
make contact at all?
 
 

The y ma de cont act wit h  her a fter t h e war t o se e  
if she could identify a
ny of the people who had 
betrayed them.  Because at t he ti me
 when all the Jews left
, s he begge d her sis t er
 not to go, to stay 
wit h he r.  Her sist er we n t  and  tha t 's  wh en t he y 
were put on the train to Au
schwitz, she was able to 
send her that letter. 
 
 
What  year was t his?
 
 
It blew my mind.  Wh en 
I went back to St. 
Laurent de Neste an
d the little to
wn--my mother
 couldn't 
remember where my uncl e was buri
ed--because I  r e member 
when he  was shot that my mother and I 
we nt  to the cemetery to th
e town, now I know its na
me  is  Sha u m (ph)  (c.359)
 a nd  we  we nt  to  plac e  
a pla que on his t o mb.  
They found her so me whe r e 
because t h ere was one girl t hat escaped from the  
group; she ran and sh
e was able to escape.  She 
lived with us, evidently, fo
r a little while.
  Her name 
was Rosa Rosenberg.  I re
member going with 
her by train to th
at little town where 
we placed that 
plaque .  When I  went ba ck, it  bl
e w  my  min d  be caus e  I  sa
w that it was just a 
fe w da ys  be for e th e  
debarcati on ( ? )(c.368) when t he  
Ameri cans went i nt o France.
 
 
So that was alr
eady fort y---?  
 
 
'44, June  44 when 
they were c aught .  
 
 
Do you know what year it was t hen
 when you were--for ex
ample, how ma ny year
s were you in this 
town then, for t hree years?
 
 
'3 9 t o '4 5.
 
 
Oh , okay, for six years.  Did 
you att e nd sc hool at  all then
 a fte r you c a me ba ck t here?
 
 
Ye s, I we nt t o s c hool .
 
 
You did.  Were you e ver  told 
you wer e Je wi sh or  a nyt hing 
li ke  that by your  pare nts?
 
 
I re me mb er my  fat her
, for a while , that he wa s trying t o tea c
h me Yi ddi sh.  I re me
mber he tried but 
I guess he fe lt that it proba
bly would not be  the  sa fe st
 t hing t o do, s o he sto
ppe d.  For  s o me r eas on , 

even though my  pare
nt s  lear ne d Yi ddish a nd I  c ertainl y unde
rstand it well, I never attempted to 
speak it .  One thi ng that I  regr et 
i m me nsel y, is  not spea king Yi ddis h.
 
 
We ll, it's never too late.
 
 
My son and I, we were go
ing to try a nd l ear n .  One ti me , I  re me
mber , I  made i nquir
ies to see if we 
coul d find--a nd ther e wa s  
a clas s but  some how we never  mat eria
lized it and learne
d Yiddish.  Do 
you s pea k it?
 
 
No .  But now I'm also th
inki ng tha t  I  should.
 
 
So me ti mes ,  I go  do wn  t o Fl orid a  w here  my  mo ther
 and father were and a
ll you hear speaking is 
Yiddis h.  I  la me nt t he  fact  that  s o
me  day it 's  not going to be  a nymore.
 
 
Probably not.  
Some  da y soon. 
 
 
It 's  such a r ic h la ngua ge, t oo. 
 
 
Ye s.  We  s h oul d all  go ta ke Yi ddi sh.  
I ha ve  be en t hinking of it   als o.
 
 
But you mu st speak He brew.
 
 
Ye s, I s pea k He bre w flue ntly.
 
 
That , I e nvy you beca use  I want
 to be able to speak it. 
 
 
I spent  a lot of ti me there.  Ar e t h ere any spec
ific epis odes or anythi ng from your war  ti me  
experiences that  stand out i n your
 mi nd vi vi dly.  I 'm su
re ther e must  
be  s o me  t hings  t h at ha ppe ne d 
or--.
 
 
Do you wa nt  to he ar 
good thi ngs , ba d t hings
?   Anyt hing at  all .
 

 
Anything, everythi ng.
 
 
l was trying to think of 
all the things that I re me
mber.  One thing I rememb
er is because we didn't  
have much food, there wasn't much
 me at in those days and I can re
me mb er my  fathe r  raisin g  rab bi t s  
in one room in that hous
e where we lived and 
we were overrun with rabbit
s.  My father
 couldn't kill 
one  of the m for food bec ause  they
 we re frie ndl y lit tle ra bbit s.  I  
don't  thi nk we at
e one of them.
 
 
That's  good.
 
 
Then I re member there wa
s a little closet outside an
d we had a duck.  I can 
reme mber one
 time, i n  
absolute awe, I opened th
e door to let the two ducks out and 
the little ducklings ca
me tumbling after 
them, the little yellow
 ducklings, that was so cu
te!  I reme mber the geese 
used to walk around the  
town.  Ther e was one place where 
t here were geese and 
they would r un afte
r you and pinch you 
somet hing fi erce.  They wer e
 awful, really, really bad.
 
 
That 's  funny.  The y we
ren't afraid of people.
 
 
No. They us ed t he m like dogs t o 
guar d place s.  Oh, yes , t hey at
t ack and t he y  are  ve ry me an.
 
 
And t he y ca n be tr
ained to do that?
 
 
I don't think they n
eed too much trai ning
.  It 's i nsti nct.
 
 
Just  gi ve  the m some  food.  That 's i nter esting. 
 I s t h ere a nyt hi ng else?  
 Those  are nice  i ma ges .
 
 
I ca n  re me mb er  s wi m mi ng  in  t he  tow n,  i n  the  riv e
r.  I ca n reme mber  goi
ng to church with my 
fri ends.  We use d t o c ut out 
the wafers for the communion. 
 
 
Your  par ent s  encouraged 
you t o go to chur ch?
 
 
Ye s, the y di d.
 

 
Did t hey go t o c hur ch too?
 
 
I think my mother attended
 a couple of ti mes, yes.
  I used to do a lot in the church.  Again, the 
chur ch was t he cent er of 
the town.  I did that.
 
 
You ha d a  l o t of pla y mat e s there?
 
 
Yes, I did.  There were all these 
t hings to do ar ound the  chur ch a
nd so on and I cert ai nlly part ook 
part in all that.   Most of it
, t hough, wa s terr or, fear.  Althou
gh after a while, my mo ther fi nally 
deci ded we  wer e goi ng to st ay to
get her and we  wer e  t oget h er, I  t h
ink there was less of it than 
be for e .   It  w a s al w a ys  t h i s  fea r ,  fi rst  o f  al l ,  t hat  
I  was goi ng to be se nt a way
.  And I was sent away a 
lot, even after the war, I was.  It wa sn't  some thin
g that remained just for 
the war.  After the war,  
also, t hat  wa s a  ki nd of betraya l on my pa
re nts ' pa rt tha t I  was  pensioned of f again.
 
 
I would li ke  to hear  a bout 
that.  Do you want fi nish
 with the war period and go
 on to that?  Is there 
anything else you can--for
 my purposes, for this project, I'm 
going to concentrate 
on the war period. 
For  the pur poses  of our  i ntervi e w, I wo
uld li ke t o  ha ve  everyt hing down. 
 
 
I'm trying to think of what
 else  you woul d be i nter ested in.  I kn
ow t hat at one ti me
, my mother tells 
me  and I don't reme mber that, she was 
told that she had to le
ave.  That it wa s no 
longer safe  fo r her. 
Don't for get  that  the mayor also was 
helpi ng us  to st ay a nd 
she wa s told not to stay there, to leave.  
She didn't know where to 
go.  She put my  brother 
in the stroller and took some food with her and 
she started walking away fro m the to
wn.  It 's not as i f  you c oul d ta ke
 a bus or a nyt hi ng li ke that  s o  
she started walking and wa
lki ng.  At ni ght , she knock
ed on the door  of a fa
rmer and asked if she 
coul d s tay with her c hildren, she 
would not ma ke any nois
e .  I  think one  of t he m re fus ed her, s h e  
wa s a frai d.  Another one  let her sta y, I think, i n t h
e barn.  The ne xt mor ni
ng, I don't know how my 
mother  di d t hat, she mus t  have b
een so fri ght ene d, t he next  morni
ng she  starte d wal king again.  I 
think t he s ec ond day, thi s Huna
i(c.480) who I used to sleep wit
h, who was  my nei ghbor, s he was  
about 18, 19, she ca me on her bicy
cl e after my mother  and t ol d her 
that it wa s sa fe, t ha t  she could  
co me bac k.   Re me mber  I  to
ld you how my  father used
 to work with the leather; he used to take  the 
skin and tan it; there's a 
whole process that 
you go through and he woul
d make a pock
etbook.  M y  
father tells the story, yo
u know how for t he  oxe n, th
ey use d  to ha ve  a  sti ck 
with like a nail on the 
end, the y woul d pric k t he m on t he  rear end t o  get  
them to go faster.  My 
father used to get mad 
beca use  t he y  used t o  rui n it , they woul d pier ce  
t he  ski n  a nd it would r ui n t he  le athe r .  He  woul d 
ma ke  the  s ki ns and my mo
ther would sell the skins,
 it  was  he r j ob.  That
 was the black mar ket .
 
 

Where di d he get t he cows and the 
oxen.  That  was ill egal , or wasn't
 it?  Where were they provided?
 
 
Wh en they killed the cows, I guess, 
they used to give my 
father the skins or he 
would buy the skins. 
He  di d  wor k  for  a  while  too .  He  wor ked  ma yb e a s
 a n  upholst er i n ______
_(c.502), he  tells  me, I  
think, he use d to go the r e  ever y s o
 oft en but t he n i t  stoppe d.  My 
mother tells me th
at  t hey managed 
to--s he  ha d mone y;  she wa s l e ft wi
t h  so me mone y.  Mr. Couquebert
, the one who wa s so helpful to 
her, when my father l e ft
 for Spain, he came  over. 
 My mot her  s ays  he open
ed his wallet and he says 
here, how much do yo
u need?  He was willi
ng to give her whatever she needed. 
 
 
That 's  very nice.  Wa s he  give n so
me  kind of commendation afterwards?
 
 
I don't know if he was.  
I think that's why--I talk
ed to my mother 
la st ni ght .  I  want ed t o  get  t he  
na mes  beca use I  t hink t he y s houl d. 
 He did perish.  He  some how went
 bac k  to Engla
nd and got back 
into the armed forces an
d he  peris he d duri ng t he  war .  He  e
nde d up bei ng kill ed.  He  ce rtainly 
should be one of t he ri ght eous beca use  he c ertai nly 
did hel p us.  I don't thi
nk without him,  we woul d 
have s urvive d.
 
 
Could be, good chance.  
It's amazing ho
w you fo und these all these little
 towns they just went all  
over .
 
 
I don't know if you saw 
the movie that wa s shown 
by Bill  M oyer s on Chan
nel 13, the education-- 
called " The Weapons of the 
Spirit".  That you've got 
to see.  It's about a lit
tle town in France called 
the Chambon.
 
 
Oh, ye s, I know a bou
t the Chambon.  Ok ay.
 
 
An  amazing, amazing story 
and I  wat che d it  gl ued t o the  t elevi si
on.  The tears just
 kept coming out 
because it remi nded me 
so much of that little
 town, where without th
em, we woul
d not have  
survi ve d.
 
 
I want  to st op t he t ape  a n
d flip it over.    Ok ay.
 
 

I re me mb er t he d a y t hat my  mot her
 got a letter fr om the Red Cross 
saying that my  
father had made 
into  Spa i n .  I  re me mber  t he  da y  tha t  my  mo th er  g o
t the letter from 
my a unt , her  si ster , t hat  she  was  
on her  wa y t o Ausc hwitz .
 
 
You didn't te ll me about  t hat on
 the ta pe, di d you?   Would yo
u l i ke t o t ell me  about  pl eas e .
 
 
My mother said that when they
 fi nall y ass e mbl ed, got a sse mbl ed 
to leave where t he basseur(c.587) 
wa s goi ng t o ta ke  over  t he Pyrenees
 into Spai n, they all got together
 in back of th
e cemeter y.   I 
re me mb er a  wo ma n  arri v i ng , I  di
dn't know who s he wa s 
and she arrived with a suitcase and she 
aske d me  a  que stion where 
my  mo th er was .  I t ol d h e r w here  
she was and I gues
s she  wa s one  of 
them.  I don't reme mber wh
o she was.  She peri shed 
also; she went with them.
 
My mot her  begge d her  s i ster  to 
stay and she wouldn't stay and sh
e  we nt.   A while  
later she got a 
letter fr om her that she was in 
a cat tle car so _____to
 Auschwitz.  I rememb
er t he day t hat my  
mother  got the letter.
 
 
How di d she --?
 
 
She was walking around in tota
l  des p air.  I  di dn't  know.
  It's only later that 
I realize what it was.  
The Russians came.  There wa s a bunch of Russians  
that came also from--I gues s they were on thei r 
way t o Franco, to Spain.  They st
opped at  our house; my mot her ha
ppe ne d to spea k Russia n.  The y 
brought her food, a nyt hi ng she wa nt
e d.  They ha d food a nd stuff, th
ey brought her i n t h e bac k.  M y 
mo ther spoke flue
nt  Russian then--.
 
 
Ho w is that?  She's fr om Poland though.
 
 
She also lived in Russia for a wh
ile.  That 's wher e she 
lear ne d Russia n.  I r e me mbe r  bei ng i n Pari s  
duri ng the  li berati on.
 
 
The Americans?
 
 
Right .  She fi nall y de cided that 
s he had t o go back t o Paris  in or
der t o get my fat he r  bac k fr om 
Spain.  We  went back to Paris an
d we lived, I think, with
 her sister for a little
 while until my father 
came back.  She found an apartment.  I reme mb
er my father coming ba
ck from Spain, brown and 
looking good with a bu
nch of bananas that we  had never 
seen.  We  became a famil y agai n.
 

 
Ho w was  th a t ?
 
 
I guess i t was tough for  the m.  Th
e y ha d l ost e veryt hing a g ain. 
 Not hin g was l e ft fr o m th e ol d  
apart me nt .  Eve r yt hing wa s gone, a p art ment s we r e ha

to tr y a nd fi nd wa ys  to-- .  Some how, the y got hold
 of my uncle in this 
c ountry and I  re me mber,  
i magine having an Uncl e Sam!.  He
 used t o send us packages 
with che wing gum a nd ever ything 
you coul d i magine i n those packages
.  In t he name of--they had t o re
build t heir lives--
we were agai n 
sent  off to homes  by our selve s.
 
 
Wa s that a common thing?
 
 
Prett y c o mmon, yes .
 
 
Where  were  you s ent?
 
 
In t he countr yside.
 
 
For how long?
 
 
A yea r, six mont hs.  I was very, ve
ry ____(c.624), very 
hard t o ta ke .  You c
oul d under s tand, I  think, 
as c hil dren we  unde rstood during 
the war that  it wa s inevitable or  that it wa s nece ssary, but after the 
war it was--.
 
 
Your  par ent s  felt that  th
ey couldn't  function, t he y c oul dn't bui
l d up as  quickl y i f  you wer e ar ound?
 
 
They did that also even before the war, as a child.
 
 
That's interesting.  Do yo
u want to talk a little bit about the ti
me after the war, 
when you came t o  
Ameri ca?
 
 

I don't know.  It probably
 won't be part of the war story so 
I don't think--I could 
tell you but I don't 
think it needs to
 be r ecor ded.
 
 
The n  tha t 's  up t o  you.  Some  peop
le want it for a sense of
 completion to tell their entire  si tuation for 
the pur pose  of t he i nter vi ew.  I f
 you'd rather not, that's  fine.
 
 
Only to say that after the war, I was seven years old 
whe n I got bac k to Par i s.
  We  lived in Paris for  
six years.   Then we came  to the United States.
 
 
So  you went to high schoo
l i n t he Uni t ed Stat es?
 
 
Ye s.  I went  to Les ane  (ph) (c .637)
, f or a  ye ar and a  hal f i n Paris.  
Then I ca me here .  I  start ed her e 
in junior high school.  My parent
s, they were born in 
Pola nd or Russia .  The y
 came t o France, my 
fat her  went  t o Spai n and came ba
ck t o France and then came here 
s o it was  a c onst ant  uphe aval  for  
the m t o adj u st a nd lear n ne w l an
gua ges a nd ne w wa ys .  It wa s  tough.
 
 
What  a bout  your  se nse  of-- once  yo
u were reunited and af
ter the war, was there any more se ns e of 
Je wishne ss i n t he fa mily?
 
 
I cer tainl y  knew t hat  I  was Jewish
 when I  was i n  France.
  I  re me mber  t hat , we  didn't  have  libr arie s 
the  way you have li brari e s here-- wh
er e you can go int o  the  li br ary a
nd pic k  any book you wa nt .  So 
they use d t o have 
books, some books in the sc
hool that you could borrow 
and you c oul d pick a book 
on one  da y.  They announ
ce d a book, some  Je wi s h hi stor y or so
mething just be fore
 it was my time 
to pick a  book and I  re me
mb er I picked a book.  
I went  to s o me organiz a
tion, I think my mother 
ma de me  joi n some  or ga nizati ons tha t  I enj oye d.  By
 and large, I think, I di
dn't know a n ythi ng a bout  
Judaism at all.  I knew more 
about, since I was in 
the convent, and all my little friends were 
Cat holi c, I kne w mor e a bout the Cat holic religi o n 
tha n I did about J uda i s m.  It wa s onl y whe n I 
ca me t o this  count y, a fte
r I got marri ed; I was al most ashame
d.  People would as k me  questi ons 
about t he J e wis h holi days and I didn't  know anyt hi ng 
about them, that I began 
to lear n what t hey all  
me ant.  It's now that I've
 starte d t o par t ake  in the  Seder  and di fferent  thi ngs.
 
 
Did you have a sense, wh
en you we re wit h t he Cat holic  c hild
ren, that you weren'
t part  of the m?
 
 
I al ways knew t her e was so
mething di fferent about me.
 
 

I 've  s poke n  t o other pe ople who 
had that.  They knew 
the y  we re goi ng t hrough
 all the motions and 
everythi ng but  sai d  that  t hey kne
w i t wasn't  thei r----. 
 Wo ul d you like t o  t alk
 about  your aunt  and 
uncl e who were ta ke n away?
 
 
They were--I rememb
er  my c ousin a nd he  was  a  brat.  
 
 
His na me wa s Ma rcel?
 
 
His name was Marcel?  I can't r e member  the l ast
 na me .  I  know that  their  na me s are i n Ya d 
Vashem.  I think that
's been r ecorded.
 
 
If you coul d fi nd tha t  out  for me?
 
 
I'll fi nd out the last name .  It just escapes me 
right now.  I don't reme mb
er, I reme mb er him mo re 
than I remember--. 
 I r e me mber t he house t he y li ved i n a nd I 
have a pict ure of t hat .  They l i ve d i n 
the house  tha t  my br other wa s bor n 
i n.  I re me mber visiti ng the m .
 
 
In Pari s?
 
 
No, i n St. Laure nt De Neste.  An
ythi ng i n Paris before the war, 
I do not  re me mber , I was just t oo  
young.
 
 
How ol d wa s Ma rcel?
 
 
He  mu st have been two or three 
year s older  than I wa s.
  He  must have  been
 about seven, ma ybe.
 
 
Do  you know where he wa s born?
 
 
He  mu st have been born in Paris.
 
 
So he  wa s a  brat?   He  wa s ra mbuncti o us?  
or  he  wa s just ba d?  or mea n t o you?
 

 
He  was  me a n,  ye s.   I al ways  felt  
guilt y a bout  sa yi ng tha t  sinc e  he  pe
rished.  But he  was.  My mother 
tells t he stor y of how he wouldn't ea
t.  You know moth
er s always have t o feed t heir , especiall y t hei r  
sons, t heir  c hildre n.  She woul d t ake and do e v ery 
t hing for  hi m s o t hat  he woul d e at.  I  do not  
re me mb er t h at mu ch .
 
 
You woul dn't know anything 
about  hi s  sc hooling, or an
y of his  fa mil y bac kgr ound?
 
 
No, I woul d have t o
 a s k  my  mo the r .
 
 
If we could fi nd t hat out  for a fu
ture  poi nt, t he n we could us e hi s stor y.  Ot her wis e, it woul d be  
difficult.
 
 
Yes, to get it together, yes.
 
 
Is there a nyt hing el se t h at you woul d like t o tell
 me that you ca n t hink of
? wit h regard t o your 
partic ular  experie nce  or  wit h a ny of t he 
r epri cusi o ns?   That is
 e ntirel y up to you.
 
 
I can't thi nk of anythi ng as far a s th
e--.  I think, as a child, it was so painful, we were in such pain al l 
the time, that we just  di dn'
t--.  It's like not 
being awake all the ti
me , it's kind of a 
st range se ns ation. 
It's  like if it was too painful, you 
just forgot, you just didn't reme mb
er or you just we
ren't there.  I 
don't know wh at I wa s thinking of
 but I don't ha ve the vi vid recoll
ections.  There are certai n thi ngs 
that  are  very vi vid, like i n t he  c onv
ent.  Ha ving to go to 
the chapel , praying--. 
 I re member the food,  
I re me mber  t he m givi ng us t his  hot c hoc olat
e ma de with water for 
breakfast and hating it.
 
 
Wh at else did you have to eat?
 
 
Bread, mostl y br ead.  That 's t he 
onl y thing that I r e me mbe r  about 
food--t omat oes, t her e must  have  
been some vegetables t hat ki ds 
didn't  like veget abl es.  I remember--a
s I sai d, I was so
 afraid to go 
into the convent.  It 
was only at the last, last 
mi nut e  t hat  I  ra ng t he  door be
ll  a n d  we  we nt.   The  t o wn  
itsel f, I can r e member
 walking fr om my ho
use to wh ere my  aunt
 use d t o li ve.  As t he  pi cture  shows  
you, t her e was li ke a wal l  in the  
street and I can reme mber the sun 
ma ki ng shadows on
 the wall.  I  
used to be so scar ed t o wal k  thr o
ugh that, it wa s like a,
 wha t do they c al l it , a  cal fule  (ph)  (c .712) , 
between two streets and oh 
I  used t o  be so scared, 
always scar ed.  I  can re
me mber having whoopi ng  
cough and being very sick.
 

 
Wa s t her e a n y wa y t o get  me dical  att e ntion?
 
 
The r e wa s a  doct or, I r e me mber  be
i ng t reate d by the doct or. I don'
t know how muc h they could do  
but  I do re me mber  ha vi ng
 t he whoopi ng cough.  
 
 
Do you think t hat t his  se ns
e of fear , you carri ed this?
 
 
Oh, ye s.  I r e me mbe r  t he  ni ght  my
 br other  wa s born.  I  wa s four ye
ars old and I reme mber that.  I  
tried to think of the tow
n.  I can reme mber my brother was alwa
ys  being absconde d,
 I  al wa ys  ha d to 
go l ook for my br other.  The y use d 
to say, he's in the shirt, in the chemise; they
 us ed t o ma ke fun of 
me .
 
 
Your  br othe r  live s i n America now?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
Do  you talk to him 
about the experience?
 
 
Not much.  I really, as
 I said, never really
 tol d the  whole  st ory.  I  re me mb
er  the woma n in that  pl ace, 
where I told you,
 whe r e we  di dn't re ally ha
ve e n ough t o eat.  How s he  us
ed to walk with her feet  
pige on li ke  t his  and I  re me mber  
onc e a ski ng her  how co me  you wal k 
like  that?  She says  when you 
get old, you'l l walk like t h at.
 
 
Did you write notes that 
you'd li ke t o look at?
 
 
These were just  notes that I wrot
e when I  sent  back to
 St. Laure nt de  Neste  about  t e n year s ago. 
Probably my  mother has one, I shou
l d get  it bac k  from her.  I  wrot
e t o he r at  gr eat  length when I  
was there, sent her some 
long l etter s.  At  ni ght  I woul d get bac k
 to the  hotel  and 
I wo uld have to 
write it down and I probably shoul
d get  that back fro m 
her because that 's  wh
en I really put my 
fe elings down, very trauma
tic.  Sh e says  she cried when she 
got the letters.  
For  a l on g ti me ,  
especiall y during t he t er rorists, wh
e n  Fra nce  di dn't wa nt t o gi ve t h
e t error i sts, I t hink it  was duri ng 
the Munich t hing--.
 

 
The Olympics?
 
 
The Ol ympics.  I got ma d at Fr ench
 and as much as I li
ke d t h e c hee ses ,  I  t hin
k, for a  whole  year , I  
boycott ed t h e cheese.  Then I be
gan to real ize, wait a second, 
how about all the  pe opl e who ha d 
bee n s o nice  and without  whom you woul dn't ha
ve survi ve d so I  start e
d to buy cheese again.
 
 
Why suffer?
 
 
No, I didn't  wa nt t he m to suffer.
 
 
Do  you identify with your
 Fr ench roots, or you've
 r e ally bee n i n
 t his countr y fo
r a long time?
 
 
Do I identi fy wit h, ye s,
 this is a part of me that's 
really--.  It 's really
 one  of t he t hings t ha t 's di ffic ult.  
When I go back t o France, some of
 the things, some of 
t he ba sic thi ngs, I  spea k Fre nc h fluentl y, but 
some of the basic things, 
sometime s, I don't know ho
w t o do, I have t o a sk.
  They look really--.
 
 
You feel  sill y?
 
 
Silly, silly.  People look
 at me , wher e have  you bee n, what  pl
anet did you come  from?   But I do 
enjoy goi ng t o Fra nce .
 
 
I was  thi nki ng, per ha ps your  home wa
s sort of atypical anyway sinc
e  your pare nts  were  i m migr ant s  
there.  Were th
ey ful ly Fr ench?
 
 
My mo ther wa s.  My father, no
, but my  mo ther 
defi nitely was.
 
 
He  ha d an ac cent  the n i n his Fre nc h as  well?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 

So he  wa s i n  gre at danger ?
 
 
My fat her  was, in more  danger  th
an  my  mo th er.   It 's  ju
st amazing that  we  di d survive as a family. 
So ma ny, a s you s a
w, di dn't survive.
 
 
Is there  anyt hing el se you wa nt 
to tell me for 
this interview?
 
 
I don't think so.  
I think this covers it. 
 Just  to make sure  that  the town doe s get recognition, that  it is 
written up--all the names of 
the people, the French.  
It was just amazing that
 without this little town, 
if they had been hostile, 
or if they had not 
wanted us, I do no
t know how we would 
have surv
ived.  I  
don't  thi nk there wa s a  wa y t o s urvive .
 
 
I would li ke for you to write down 
t h ese  na me s  for me  i f  you coul d do
 t his .  At t his  poi nt, I guess ,  
we  ca n stop and I want  
to thank you 
very mu ch.
 
 
My plea sur e.
