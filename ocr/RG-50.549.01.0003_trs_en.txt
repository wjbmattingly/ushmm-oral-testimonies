Answer: Aft er t h e war, I came 
t o F r anc e as  part of a lar g e tr ans p ort of childr e n who 
had been collected behind t
he Ir on Curt ain and by sma
ll stages, brought out from 
Poland, the Ukraine, Russia, Cz echoslovak
ia and etcetera.  
We ended up, this 
whole group of children en
ded up in a hom e in Barb
iz on(ph), wh ich is near 
Fountainbleu(ph) in France
 and the home was,
 I don't know exactly who ran the 
home, but it was some Je
wish organization and most 
of those chil dren were 
destined to go to Israel to 
the kibbutzim(ph).  It was r
un by a couple and their son, 
they liv e d on t he pr em ises and t h e m an, by
 the name of Er ic  
Shot(ph), befriended 
me.  And when all the c h ildr
en were moving out 
to go to Israel
, they decid ed to 
keep me.  They had a 
son and they wanted a 
daughter, so I 
was it.  As 
soon as the 
home was closed up, after th
e c h ildr en left,  I mov e d, wi
th the Shots( ph) to Paris 
and that's where I real
ly started my life in
 France because in Ba
rbizon(ph) I was still 
part of a gr oup t h at 
didn't speak French, but as soon
 as I moved t o Par i s I had t o  
start going to school and I ha
d to start learning the languag
e.  So that's when, wh en 
really my French ex
perienc e st art ed.  And I start e
d school and I 
was one of th e 
oldest in the grades of course
, because I was past 11 and 
most of the ot hers were 
young children who were lear
ning how to read and wr
it e and so was I, but in 
addition I also had to learn 
the language.  I live
d with the Shots(ph
) for quit e awhile, 
until Mr. Shot(ph) died
 and then I went to 
live with friend of t
heirs by the name of 
Katz(ph), Mr. and Mrs.
 Katz(ph), becau
s e  t hey  wer e  my guar dians.   M r . Shot( ph)  
was m y guar dian and then Mr. Katz( p h) t he back up as  a guar d
ian and when Mr. , 
Er ic  Shot( p h) died, Mr.  Kat z( ph)  bec am e t h
e guardian and I had to
 go and live with 
them and I lived with them
 and during that pe
riod, I was also 
going to school, yo u 
know, and trying to
 r eally c atc h up,  I had t o play a lo
t of c a tch up, I had t o lear n a lot  
of things of course.  I found
 it very exciting, the Frenc
h schools, I think France was 
a v ery exc i ting c ountr y to m e, t h ey off e
r ed a lot of wonderf u l exper iences I had 
never had before and 
I found the people extr
emely friendly and fu
n-loving and I had 
a great time in France.  At 
the s a me t im e as  I was liv i ng
 wit h t he Katz 's( p h), or t he 
Shot s( ph) f or t h at  mat t er,  I was  als o v ery
 friendly with a coup
le, they were both 
Doctors, because in 
Bar biz on(ph) , they us ed to c om e to exam ine t he c hildr e n,  yo u 
know, t o pr ov ide m edical c are
 and they lived in
 Paris too, with their daughter an d 
that was Dr . Lehm an( p
h) and Mr s.  Lehm an( p h) and t
heir daughter Re
ne(ph).  And I 
stayed on very friendly terms
 with
 them, so ev en when I lived with the Katz's(ph), I 

was s eeing the Lehm ans( ph) 
quite a bit and then at 
one point Mrs. Lehman(ph) 
asked me to come and live with
 them.  It was rather
 difficult to live 
in the Katz's(ph) 
household, Mr. Katz(ph) was a 
very uptight, very 
exacting individual 
and it  was very 
hard to please him and
 I wa s re a l ly lo ok in g f or wa ys t o
 get out of that
 home.  They 
had t w o sons, one of t hem wa
s married and he made his so
ns very miserable.  He 
didn't pick on me particularl
y, but he wa s not a pleasant 
man t o liv e wit h and I  was  
a y o ung gir l  and I want ed mor e
 freedom and I wasn't gett
ing any freedom at all and 
so with the help of Mrs. Lehman(ph), wh
o inquir ed about it  and gav e me th e 
information, I was able to beco
me of age bef o re I was  real
ly of age.  You were, you 
didn't bec o me of age until 21 
and at the time I wa s 17 or 18 and you had to appear 
in fr ont of a j udge wit h t w o 
or three witnesses to testify 
to your  maturi
ty and your 
character and then you 
could be of age and 
responsible for yourse
lf .  So at t h e ag e 
of eit h er 17 or 18, I don't r em em b er what
 age, probably 17, I be
came, I became an 
adult so to speak and
 I was responsible fo
r myself, legally, whic
h was very nice.  I 
lived with the, 
wit h t he Lehm ans( ph) fo
r awhile, while I was st
ill going to school and 
finis h ing up my  s ec o ndar y educ at ion, wh
ic h was I,  I  hav e a bac cala ur eat e in 
philosophy, whic h I did through the French school system, 
whic h wasn't easy, but it  
was s ort of  fun.  And, an
d at that point, Mr. and Mr s.
 Lehm an( ph) had t o m ov e  t o  
Germany, because he
 was a doctor who 
had taken his training
 in Germany and he 
was not able to pr act i ce in Fr anc e, he ha
d t r ied t o pas s the 
exam, but he wasn't 
able t o pr actic e, s o t h ey 
decided to go back to Ge
rmany and open up a practic e  
together and they left th
eir  daught er and me in t h eir apar
tment in Paris.  But during 
the school vacations we always
 went t o G e rmany t o st ay
 wit h them and on one of  
thos e v ac at i ons, dur i ng the sum m er, t hat 's
 when I met Jim.  
Jim was an American 
soldier, st at ioned, t h e Am er ic an f orc es st at
ioned in Heidelberg(p
h) and I  met him at  
an afternoon tea dance 
given by the Univ ersity of He i
delberg(ph).  So 
I met him, but 
I spoke hardly any Englis h and he didn't 
s peak any Fr enc h or any Germ an f or  that  
matt er, he only had a few 
words of G erm an,  I s poke Ge
rman and F r enc h, but  ver y  
little English.  But we sa
w each other during the couple 
of weeks I was t h ere bef or e  
I had to go back to 
France to go back to 
school.  An d then he 
began visiting me in 
Paris and then when 
he wa s discharged and sent 
back to the United States, he 
continued to wr it e and to 
send me friends, yo
u know, I had a whole, there was a 
whole c o llection of fr iends who c a me thr o u
gh Pa
ris and they all 
stopped off to visit 
with me.  And le
t's see, what happened at that poin
t, yeah, one of hi
s friends who,  
whom  I had m et at t h e s am e t im e as I m e
t Jim, at that  tea danc e,  was a m a n fr om  
Minnesota who wa s working af
ter his discharge fr
om the army, actually during his 
army career he was working 
for intelligence an
d after his dis c har ge, the Am er ican 
gov er nment put him in radio 
free Europe.  So he wa s in
 Europe and he wa s visiting 
wit h me quite often and on 
his way back to the Un it ed 
St at es, bec ause at one point  
he decided to go back to th
e United Stat es bec aus e he 
was going to go to the 
Woodrow Wilson cent er at 
Pr inc e ton and, and work t h er
e f or awhile and t e ac h an d 

then go back to Minnesota bec
ause he had a job at the Un iv
ersity of Minnesota. 
So on his way back, he st
opped off in Paris and he 
stayed for ab
out a weekend 
there and when he
 lef t  he as ked me t o
 marry him.  And I wa
sn't sure, you know, I  
mean, you know I wasn't so 
sure I want ed t o go off  to
 t he United Stat es and I  
wasn't so sure I want ed to marry him.  
But on, when he got 
back to the Unite d  
St ates, he went thro
ugh New York on his 
way to Washington 
to be debriefed and 
he saw Jim and he told Jim. 
 Actually he didn
't tell him he was 
going to marry me,  
but he told him that he had 
spent time with me and that I might come to the United 
St ates, because what happened
 was I said, "Well, I'm no
t so sure I wa nt to get 
marr ied. "  And he was look in
g f o r ot her way s and we had 
st art ed applicat ions for a 
Fullbright for me to go to Pr inceton.  So he
 told Jim that  I might come to Pr inceton 
on a Fullbright and when Jim 
heard that, he sold 
his car, he took
 his money and he 
cam e back to Eur ope.   And 
about three weeks later we we
re married.  So t hat's 
how it happened, that I met Jim, I got marrie
d and from then on 
my life in France 
was finished and I was moving
 t o the Unit ed St at es .  
 So I came to the United 
St ates as a br ide of an Am er
ic an, who knew very
 little English and
 who had to find 
her wa y again in  a new country.
  I must say it was a cha
llenge, it took me a couple 
of y e ars t o,  to r eally get the bett er of it. 
 But I had t o get a job 
r i ght a wa y and I got a 
very good job wi th a,
 a French government o
ffice in New York, it
 wa s a Fr e nc h film  
off ic e, whic h was a v ery 
glamorous job, everybody 
envied me because I was 
receptionist, but I wa
s also squiring around the French
 m ov i e st ar s when t h ey cam e  
to Paris for the release of their pictures, so
 it was a v ery glam or
ous j ob I had.  And 
Jim worked for NBC and we ha
d about four single years like
 that, where we really, I 
really got to enjoy 
Ne w York and le arn the language 
and you know, and try to fit 
mys e lf in t o  th e Un it e d St ate s.  A n d t he n 
we had a child after fo
ur y e ars,  Laur a, our 
daughter, who is 35 now a
nd we moved to a house on 
Long Island.  Actually we 
moved to another apartme
nt.  I really got used
 to living in
 the Un it ed St ates.  And 
then we had a son and aft e
r we had two children we 
dec i ded we bett er buy a 
house, so we 
bought a house on L
ong Island.  I have
 to explain when I'm saying we 
bought a house, it  seems like
 a landmark.  All 
my friends wa nted 
houses, I didn't 
want a house because I neve
r wanted possessions becaus
e it scared me to own 
things.  So it took Jim awhile to talk me
 into
 for us to move into a house.  But 
eventually I realiz ed that 
he was r i ght, y o u k now, with t w
o c h ildren y ou d o n't  liv e in 
an apartment, it's nice
r to have a yard and 
to have swings and such.  So we moved 
into a very nice
 house on Long Island 
and the children started 
going to school.  By 
then Laura start e d k inder gart e n 
on Long Island and Er ic pr
etty s oon start e d nur ser y 
school, where I think I spen
t more time than he did 
bec a us e I was v er y oft en a 
volunteer there and Iived the American s
uburban life, you know
 and that was again 
a different kind of life I tried to fit myself 
into.  So first I was work ing and then I was a 
mother and then at one poi
nt, Jim had an idea
 for a public atio
n, an index t o  
congressional document
s and for that we had to move 
to Washington.  So here we  

were with two small childr
en, two young children, packe
d up everything and came 
to Washington to start anew project.  And Jim made it
 perfectly  cl
ear that he 
couldn't do it on his own, I 
had t o  be par t of it , I had to 
be his partner.  So  I had two 
small children and 
f or a per iod of 10 y e ars I  manage
d to somehow to be a mother 
and a hom em ak er and a c o ok and als o at t
he sam e t i me, cr eate a syst em f or, by 
which we collected doc
uments on Capital Hill
, made contacts in
 every co
mmittee, 
lear ned my  way ar ound t he 
Am erican government, in cludi
ng what it  does and ho w 
to best br ing on the contr o
l of this unwieldy 
output of  paper that  the Am er ican 
government produces.  And 
we  did.  We started a 
ver y successf ul business  
together and we run that bu
siness creating 
indexes for resear
ch and academic 
libraries, whic h ar e ex trem ely  v a luable. 
 And we r u n t hat 
company for about 10 
year s and t hen we s o ld it, 
we sold it to a Dutch comp
any, Elsoveer(ph), but th e 
company's still going on and mo
st of the people we hired 
are still there, hired an d 
trained.  First I started doin
g the, the set up of the syst
em on Capital 
Hill on how t o  
collect all those documents 
and when t hat was under co
ntrol, I put two people in 
charge of that and then I 
had t o com e in becaus e by 
t hen we had lo
ts of people 
working for us and Jim was 
the creative man, doing t
he indexing and the dealing 
with computers, but somebody
 had to take care of pe
rsonnel and administration 
because at one point we were
 each 300 people, 
so that was a larg
e business and it  
needed ... so I came 
in and I took over administ
ration personnel 
and I created 
salary adm i nistr at i on syst ems which I 'd, 
I only stay ed one st
ep ahead bec ause I  
would take seminars and th
en decide, you k
now, how we needed to do it an d 
administr at i on, we had a plant by t hen, pr od
ucing m ic r of iche and I was in char ge of  
the plant also, whic h em ploy
ed about 75 people, wh ich 
was out in Rockville(ph) 
Excuse me.  (pause).  Okay
, so where did we 
stop, yes, so we 
were running this  
very large busine
ss and I was in  charge
 of personnel and administ
ration in  the plant 
and J im was in c h ar ge of th
e edit or ial end of it and 
af ter 10 y ear s we sold t he 
company.  It was an unusual 
com pany, was one of the f ir s
t of inf or m at ion r etr iev a l 
com panies  that we had cr
eat ed and was an ext r em ely va
luable com p any and it  
made W a ll Str e et hist ory, bec aus e of, y ou k n
ow,  of t he er a it  s ort of br ought in t o  
the Unit ed States busines s wor l d.  We 
were extr em ely pr oud of  that com p an y  
because not only did we crea
te tools which were very va
luable for researchers in 
ac ademic plac es,  but  als o it  bec am e a t ool 
for law offices, ther
e isn't a law off i
c e  
that doesn't have our index, 
when they used to 
create legislativ e 
histories, I don't 
know if they still n
eed it as badly, but ther e was a 
long period of 
t im e wher e a la w 
office couldn't operate with
out our index because that to
ld them immediately what 
was going on on Capital Hill, 
to follow through a piece 
of legislatio
n, from the 
various stages, with all it's
 documents, you know, attach
ed t o it and wher eas t he y  
used to have to 
em ploy  people wit h long
 hour s t o cr eat e thos e hist or ies,  they, fr om  
us they could do it  
almost immediately with our tools.
  So it  wa s not only a profitable 
company, but it was a 
useful thing to have 
cr eat ed.   And we als o
 ran a very unusual 

ship, in terms of our employ
ees could buy stock, they ow
ned part of 
the company. 
We fe lt it 's muc h b ett e r  
to shar e and t o hav e em ploy
ees, you know, who were loyal 
to a c om p any bec ause it was 
part ly t h eir s and als o  we st art e d one of t he f i rst 
pr act i ces of  flex t im e for women with c h ildr
en, wher e t h ey could wor k only part-t ime,  
you k n ow, as a consequenc e we got muc h 
better workers.  Many in telligent wome n 
didn't want to take full-time
 jobs because they had you
ng children at ho
me and that 
gav e them an opport unity t o 
do intellectual work
 and still have flexible hours.  So  
we were sort of ____ in many
 social wa ys too.  At this
 point, did you wa nt me to 
continue in  Washington or do 
you want me to go 
back a little bit 
to New York?  You 
want ed t o ask a f e w quest ions ?
 
Question: Yeah, I wanted 
to go back to New York.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And tell me, did 
y ou meet up with s ur v iv ors  wh
en you were in New York?
 
A: No, no, bec aus e I, I  stepped in
to Jim's kind of life.  Jim worked for NBC, I worked 
for, f or a company on Madiso
n Avenue, you know, a French
 off ic e and most o f  the 
people we saw we re Jim's fr
iends or the people we made 
friends with at work.  By 
and large it  was a crowd of 
reporters, tele vision people,
 radio people, you know. 
Adv ert is ing people and m ost ly people lik
e that and m a y be s o
me people whom Jim 
had known as a child, because in  fact I 
had met a couple of, of
 people he had gone 
to high school with and I 
became extremely friendly 
with one young
 woman who 
had gone to high 
school with him, who stay
ed my best fr
iend until she died a couple 
of years ago, you know, th
ey lived in Connecticut, but 
that was a couple who was  
extr em ely  c l os e t o  us.  So 
I started making frie
nds am ongst t h e Am er ic ans,  but  I  did 
not s ee any s urv ivor s.   I don't t h ink sur v iv
or s s ear c h out ot her s u rv iv ors.  I t h ink,  
part ic ularly in my c as e , I want ed a norm al
 lif e and I want ed t o st ep int o a norma l 
life.  I didn't want to
 live in the past, I didn't want to
 talk about wh at 
happened to me 
and in f act I ver y s e ldom t a lk ed about i
t.  Most of our friends
 didn't know I was a 
Ho lo c au st sur v iv or.   A s f ar 
as they knew I cam from Fr
ance and that was it, I was 
learning the language, I wa s learning t
he customs, I was beco
ming Americanized, 
but they did not know I  was a 
Holocaust survivor.  In fact 
Jim knew very li ttle about 
it, he knew, but I never talk
ed about it a
nd he didn't quiz me 
about it, so I very 
seldom talked about it and 
I did not search out any ot
her Holocaus t s urv ivor s.  
Howe ver, a very funny thing 
happened.  Jim 
was very politically 
inclined always and 
I began t o get, to t ak e  an inte
r e st  in polit i cs an
d we went to a St
ev ens on r a lly onc e 
in Queens, a huge r a lly  and 
I look ed ac ross t he 
ar ena and I s a w a 
young gir l and I  
said, I know this person, I k
new her in Bratislava.  So 
we went up and I said,  "Ar e  
you Blanc a (ph)?  Blanca Br uner
(ph)?" and she said yes.  
 I hadn't seen her in  lik e  
what, 10, 11 years and she wa
s just as amazed as I was 
that I had recognized an d 
she recognized me too, so we
 sort of started 
contact and I wa nted
 to see her and 

she called me up an
d she told  me that 
her father forbade he
r to see me.  And I 
said, "Why?  He doesn't know 
me."  And she said, "yes, that's just it."  They were 
very Orthodox Jews and th
ey  didn't m i x wit h any ot
her Jews and she was not 
allowed t o see m e.  So t he 
only one I could have had cont
act with, her fa
ther cut it  
off, he absolutely forbade he
r to see me, because
 I was not a practicing Orthodox 
Jew.   So that was the end of  that.  So 
to answer your questi
on, I did not see any 
Holo caust surviv ors, I did not ta
lk  about  it v e ry oft en,  I didn
't read about 
it.  I really 
concentrated all my energi
es on adapt i ng mys e lf t o a 
normal life in the United 
States and I think I succ
eeded pretty we ll, so.
 
Q: Did y o u ev er, at any point, f eel that y o u 
were missing somethin
g,  or was it jus t  
kind of, y o u j ust  want ed t o 
put that in the past.  Was th
ere a part of you that was 
curious, wanted that sort
 of bond or was it l
onely?  I was just ...
 
A: Yes, t here were t im es when
 it was lonely, but it was 
also amusing, like I would 
hav e a fr iend who would s it over  coff ee wi
t h me and cry t hat she had an ident it y  
cris is  and here I wa s, I di
dn't know my name, 
I didn't know my 
age, I didn't know 
wher e I came fr om and I f e l
t, well, I'm not any wor se off  
then she is.  She's hav i n g  
an identity crisis?  
I don't think, you know
, I don't think I'm any 
worse off.  At least I 
don't know, you know, it 's a cl
ean slat e.  So y es, I did f
eel at times lonely, becaus e  
nobody I knew could share with
 me what I'd gone
 through, but at 
the same time I 
thought, it gav e me a cert ain per s pect iv e wh
er e mor e tr ivial t h ings
 didn't bother me 
the s am e way as t hey
 seemed to bother 
my friends, okay?  
Many of t h em were 
bothered that they didn't ha
ve, they were hoping that 
their careers would have been 
more advanced and they 
were busy at home 
with the kids and t
hey couldn't do this 
and they couldn't do that a
nd they were very 
bothered.  It didn't 
bother me to be 
home with t he k i ds.   It ' s tr ue t hat  I  wor ked
 until the kids were bor
n.  I tr ied,  I had a 
very good job w
hen I was pr egnant wit h Laur a and I 
would hav e lik e d t o go bac k to  
it, but by then I was working fo
r the United Nations and I ha
d a very good job.   I was  
work ing for the am bas s ador fr om Laos to t h
e United Na tions, you know, one of the 
IndoChines e c o untr i es,  French speak i ng.  
I had a v er y good j ob, I mean I wor ked 
until t w o weeks bef or e s h
e was  bor n and they want ed
 me back and I started 
negotiatin g and they wanted 
me full time and I knew I co
uldn't wa lk out of there at 
fiv e o' c lock  and y et I had a 
child and I c ouldn't s e e m ys e
lf leav ing the c h ild,  so I  
dec i ded not  to work.  So I 
m a de the dec is i on voluntarily 
and I  s om e how didn't  f eel 
that I wa s being penalized in 
any way.   So I ha
d adv ant ages t h at 
others didn't have, 
in a way.  And t h en, befor e
 I ev en had t im e to t ur n ar
ound and feel t h at oh my  
goodness, what am I goi
ng to do wi
th my life now that the 
children are going to start 
sc hool, J im  said, "W e ar e st art i ng a bus ines
s."  And so when m y
 son went  off to 
Kinder garten for half a day, 
I went off to work.  In fact
 I had t o rus h  ba ck hom e t o  
greet him because he only 
had half a day of school.  So
 I never had some of the 
pr oblem s that I could see my
 fr iends had.  I had m y s e
t  of pr oblem s bec a us e I  had 

hang-ups because of my pas
t, you know.  But, li
ke for instance, you know, taking 
care of the children, 
I was alwa ys  very 
concerned that they 
should not catch cold 
and when t hey wer e s i ck I felt s i c k and t h i
ngs lik e t hat .  I'm s ur e that my Amer ic an 
counterparts didn't feel that
 t o t h e sam e degr ee as I did.
  The anxiet y over c h ild r en,  
partic ularly.  But on the ot
her hand, they had other anxie
t i es whic h I didn't hav e,  s o  
I felt I 'm not  doing t oo badly, ok ay
, so that's how 
I felt about it.
 
Q: You said earlier, in
 another interview, 
that you didn't tell
 your children, so?
 
A: No, I thought that and I 
thin k probably I made a mist
ake, because I didn't speak 
about it , they knew I was fo
reign, yeah I was French, but 
t hen, when our  k i ds  wer e 
in school, there were 
several kids in classes that my
 daughter had, 
who had French 
parent s, s o  that wasn't  an od
dity, that much of 
an oddity fo
r her and I didn't feel I 
wanted to burden them.  Firs
t of all, I felt  uncomfortabl
e myself  talking about it  and 
secondly I was very concerne
d not to overburden
 the children.  
So I didn't talk 
about it and it 's only when our daughter was 
going to religiou
s school, she came 
back , want  to st op it ?  
She came back
 one day and 
apparently they had bee n 
discussing the Holocaust. 
 You know ther e was a pe
riod where the Holoc aus t  
wasn't discussed to the same
 degree that it  is being 
discussed now.  There is an 
awar enes s now whic h I don't t h ink exist e d at  the t im e when I ca
m e  to Ne w Y o rk.  
And she came home from 
religious school and she as
ked me am I a Holocaust 
sur v iv or and I s a id, " y es. "  
And s he was s o ups et.  "W hy
 didn't y ou ever t e ll m e  
anything about it, wh y didn't 
you say anyt hing about it ?" 
 And I realiz ed that I had 
made a m i stak e, s h e was tr uly ups et.  And 
from then on she just kept on diggin g 
and asking questions 
and t h is and that and I r ealiz ed t h at  I had t o do an about f ac e  
and face the past and 
come to terms with it
 myself, but partic ular
ly for the sake of 
my children.
 
Q: How old were y o u at  that point ?
 
A: W e ll, let ' s s e e, Laur a wa
s born when I was 25 and at
 that point she must have 
been 11.  About 36, 37.
 
Q: How did you, in y o ur  own wa
y, come to te
rms with it ?
 
A: I st art ed reading about it
, because I started, I starte
d to, trying 
t o put s om e  
chronological or der  into my memories.  And 
that' s when I st art e d t a lk ing t o J im ,  bu t  
mostly to female friends, I had
 always very close female 
friends.  I had a couple in 
New Yor k who wer e v ery c lose t o  me.  And 
so when I was r e ady 
to talk, they were  
listening, you know and they 
were always ready 
to listen, so I w
ould discuss certain 
matt ers.  And wit h J im, 
t oo and try t o put s om e c hr onologic al or der int o my  
memories.  At that point, 
J im bec am e v ery helpf ul bec a us e he st ar ted gett ing me 
books and I would tell him reco
llections and then he woul
d find books and he would 

say, "Your recollections are 
correct."  Like I 
would have recollect
ions about  what 
happened in the forest
 after we escaped from conc
entratio n camp 
and he found a 
book, I don't remember
 what it is,  we have a libr ar
y of them by now.  An d sure 
enough, it described almost 
the way I had describ
ed to him what it  was like.  Those 
bands, you know, of 
deserters and Jewish 
people hiding and children and this and  
that and it  was very accurate, so I knew 
t h at m y m e mory  was n' t  play ing tr icks . 
That 's the way I was trying to, you know, to 
deal wit h t h e, and I  
was able t o sort of  
make some or der out of w
hat had happened, by talk ing 
about it and t h en r eadin g  
up and c o nf irm i ng that my memo
ries were actually accurate.
 
Q: Did y o u ev er j o in, wer e ther e s urv ivor gr
oups, did you ever, after that experience 
in Ne w York, did you 
meet up with anyone?
 
A: No.  As a matter of fa
ct I have a very good
 friend who lives 
in New Jersey, who 
is als o a s u rv iv or.  She had a s om e what 
differ ent path t h an m i ne, in that s h e was  
with her mother and 
her brother all through 
it, and then emig ra
ted to Venezuela. 
When they left Eu
r ope,  they  went t o Ve
nezuela, so she is  sort
 of Latin Am er ic an i n  
her out l ook  bec aus e s he went t o  sc hool 
t here and t hen s h e c am e to the United 
St ates and she c alled me onc e t h at t h ere 
was a group of hidden
 children that was 
meet ing and I s hould j o in t h em 
and I was n 't ready.  I just
 absolutely re
fused.  She 
went  to this  meet ing, t h ey 
had wr itten, they wr ote a book,
 somebody at Yale, I think 
a wom a n at  Yale, who does a lot of res e arc h
 in that ar ea,  put t
ogether a book of the 
recollections of the hidden ch
ildren and my friend wa s part 
of it and s he sent me the 
book.  You know, I read
 her part, I couldn't read the 
ot her s.  I j ust didn't f ee l  I  
want ed t o go bac k and dwell 
on it.  I just couldn't re
ad t h e ot hers.  And so I  
understood that I really wasn't ready to join
 that group and to sh
are in great detail 
and just dwell that much.  Th
at's not my, my natu
re.  My natu
re is to lo
ok ahead an d 
I can't look, I only looked ba
ck as far as I needed 
to to put some orde
r into it and to 
sort of pres ent it t o my  childr en.  But I 
d o n't t h in k I wa nt to 
dwell any more on that 
than t h at.
 
Q: When you say dwell, is it  
some of the pain an
d the experience of
 it t h at sc ares  
you t o go bac k?  Desc ri
be s ort of what ' s goi
ng on in your head.
 
A: W e ll, of  cour se ther e' s 
pain.  T her e's pain,  ther e's  
fear, y o u kno w, t h er e' s an  
enorm o us am ount of f ear a nd y o u st art thinking of how,
 what a t err ible plac e the 
world is  and it 's very hard 
to get up in the mo
rning.  In fact I had that experience 
when the Holo caust Museum 
opened and my husband Jim t
hought that it would b e  
a good idea if  we went
 together with our children.  
By t hen bot h our 
children were 
marr ied, so ther e were 
six of us going ov er t here.  I 
think for my kids
 it was a g oo d  
exper ience.   For m e, I cam e back and it 
did something.  Fo
r a week I couldn't 
function.  I couldn't get up 
in t h e mor n ing.  And I  didn't
 really know 
why, except I 
kept on cr ying and I was having myself 
a depr ess i on,  which I am not prone t o  

usually, I try, you know, whe
never there are things that 
used to bubbl
e up to the 
surface, I would always, either
 call a friend, or 
do something constr
uct i ve or r e ad a 
good book and get myself aw
ay fr om it.  But going t h
rough t h e Holocaus t Mus eum  
put me into a depressio
n where I had difficulty
 pulling myself out of
.  So what really 
sc ar es m e about dwelling t o o much on t h e past
 is t h at it  does creat e a bitter ness .  
[end of s ide one of t ape one] 
 
Q: So, where were we?  Okay
, you were saying why you 
didn't want to dwell on it.
 
A: Yeah, I think it's 
depressing to dwell on i
t, it 's very depressing 
to me, okay?  So I 
would rather not dwell on it , I 
would r ather look at t h e li
fe I'm leading now and to my 
future, really.  So I guess I'm finished with that  thought.
 
Q: How did you pull y o urs e lf 
out of it at that time?
 
A: I think I got the help from
 friends.  I have, I have t
he m o st incredible c ir cle of  
friends and they were calling all the time
 and they were ch
ecking up on me and 
they were suggesting things
 we should be doing 
and t h ey  wer e  br
inging me books  
and I st art e d r eading again and 
I start e d gett ing involv ed in
 life.  You know, life is 
irr es i st ible, it 's, if y o u s t art 
getting involved in 
it, it just carries 
you along and that' s  
what you need to do
 and that's really what I di
d to pull mys e lf out of it. 
 
Q: All r i ght ,  let 's  go back  fo
r a moment, you were talk in
g about the bu
siness.  We 
had gott en to t he point wher e I belie
v e you were going t o se ll it ?
 
A: Yes, _____ sell it.
 
Q: Okay, so let's start up 
at that point and then t
he f o llowing y ears af ter t hat.
 
A: Right, okay.  So we deci
ded t o s e ll t h e bus i nes s m a
inly bec a us e m y hus b and,  
my husband's health at that 
point was a little shaky and 
he, it was, he was really 
suff er ing fr om extr em e exhaus
tion, so we decided to sell
 the business, but it's not 
so easy to sell 
a business li ke that an
d it t ook about a y ear 
to complete the sale. 
And t hen we were st ay ing on 
for awhile because it  was pa
rt of our contract, so we 
stayed on for awhile, bu
t t hen we, Jim just want ed no par
t of it any more, he wanted 
to get out of it, so we r
enegot i at ed out,  we went  t o 
Am sterdam to renegotiate his 
contr act  and we lef t  t h e bus i ness  in ve
r y good s h ape, you k
now, with very good 
people are there running it and
 it's still in excellent, it
's a very good 
business that 
they bought themselv es.  An
d then we had about a year
 to decid e, you know, to 
clean up all the paperwork fr
om t h e s a le and t he dist ribu
t i on of, t o all the em ploy ees  
and all of that and then we deci
ded to do a little bit of tr
avelin g and I thin k just about 
that time, our son went off 
to college, so the 
nest  was r eally em
pty and he teases 
us,  funny  bec a us e f or  my 60
th birthday, he 
gave us a whole 
speech, you know, 
they gav e me a part y  and 
he made a speech and he 
s a id when he went off t o  

college,  he had t h e im pr es sion t h at t h is  is  
the moment we were 
waiting for, really, 
because our bags must have
 been packed, because the 
minute he went off to 
college,  off  we went.   And we di
d a lot of tr aveling,  we did.
  I'm trying to remember, I 
know we made a trip 
to Japan, but that  wa
s still for business, t h
is was, we did one 
last piec e of bus i ness  for 
t h e, f or  the c om pany which 
we sold and 
we had some 
contracts with Japanese publis
hers and we had to go to 
Japan, so we
 did that, 
which was very interesting. 
 And we went t o Europe, we
 traveled with friends, with 
our fr iends from Connect i cut, y ou k now,  
whom Jim has known 
since high school.  
We went to Italy with them, 
we t ook a tr ip t o the sout h 
of France with 
them.  We had 
other friends we  we re 
traveling with.  We we nt to, we
 went to Alaska
, we went to 
Australia and New Zealand.  We
 really did quit e a bit of
 tr av eling and I lov e  t o  
travel.  And we enjoy it .  We
 usually go with friends, on
e or two couples.  We went 
to Spain j us t  rec ent ly, we went to east er n 
Eur ope last May.  So
 we have done quite 
a bit of traveling, but the fi
r st y e ar we r eally did a lot 
of traveling, in the Unit ed 
St ates, you know, going to 
the west coast, doing just
 more, Canada, more local 
things.  An d then we decide
d t o open a diff er ent k ind 
of publis hing 
house because 
Jim's am bit i on was always to 
be a publisher of books, not
 of specialized material 
like we had just sold
, but of trade books. 
 So we started Adler and Adler publishers. 
And we  ran that company fo
r a couple of years and we 
published some 46 or 4 8  
books.  And that was entire
ly different ball ga
me.  It was very in
ter est ing bec a us e I  
start e d doing editing, whic h I 
had never done befo
re and I really lik
ed it.  But after 
awhile, you know, we  notice
d that the book business, 
the climate had changed, it 
was ver y difficult t o sell b
ooks and part ic ularly the k i nd 
of books we liked, you know, 
lit erary books, s er i ous  book s, they weren'
t selling easily, it wa
s very diffic ult to 
mark et t hem.  So we dec i ded 
to phase it out.  
But by t h en I had becom e inv o lved in 
community work.  I became as
s o ciat ed wit h the Ar ena St
age, I don't know if yo u 
are familiar with the Arena 
Stage Theater.  I got on t
he board of t
he Arena Stage 
and I was ver y act iv e there.
  W e,  bot h J im and I j oined Jewish or ganiz at ions, lik e  
Am er ic an Jewish Committ ee and we bec am e
 very active, in fact Jim is  no w 
Pr esident, just became Pr esident of the Wa
shin gton chapter of 
AJC.  And I got on 
the board of the Capital Ch ild
ren's Museum, I became very 
friendly with the director 
there,  Ann Lewin( p h) and f or aw
hile I was quite active ther
e, although I'
m not active 
now, even though they still
 keep my name on the board,
 I hardly
 go to meetings 
any more and I really  sort 
of became very much involv
ed in community affairs of 
that sort, you know, partic ular
ly in the arts.  I'm also on
 the board of the opera, so 
you know, I go to the opera 
a lot, I go to the 
theater a lot and as
 a consequence of 
being on t h os e boards ,  part ic
ularly the Ar ena St
age, we made a lo
t of friends who  
ar e s im i lar l y inc lined, who lov e the theate
r, y ou know, s o ther e' s a whole g r oup o f  
us who love the thea
ter and who play tennis and we 
play tennis and travel and we  
travel.  We  just went with
 two of the couple to, to London.
  So we, we 
really have 
become more involved in the community.  We
 still have an offi
ce and some of the 

books are still being 
sold, but I don't need 
to go in  there beca
use my area was more 
acquiring books, dealing with
 agents and edit ing and 
we ar e not  ac quir ing ne w 
books, so it's just a matter
 of running the office and ma
ke sure that 
some of the 
books t hat ar e st ill selling ar
e being repr inted and s o ld. 
 So my husb
and goes into 
the office, but I do not.  A
nd we're ver y m uc h inv o lv ed 
in the community, the Jewish 
comm unity and suc h.  So
 that 's r eally what our liv es ar
e like right now.  (pause).  All 
right, we have two children, ye
ah I think we should, I want 
to talk a little bit about 
the children now, we  have two children, we
 have a daught er Laur a,
 who is 35 years 
old and we  have a son Er ic, 
who is 31 years old.  Our 
daughter lives 
in this area 
and she is married 
and she has two children.  I 
have a six year old granddaughter 
and a almost two year old grand
son and they live 
in  this area and 
I see them often, 
so, you know, I also, this is 
something I really 
enjoy, seeing my 
grandchildren.  I 
thin k probably my past has af
fected my children,
 but it  is very 
hard for me t o  
ev aluat e in what way.  When 
I look at our s o n, who was  
married, is 
divorced now, 
who came out of, from coll
ege, he went t o  Swat hmor e(
ph) and started teaching 
bec aus e he got m arr ied lik e t hr e e weeks  af
ter  he got out  of co
llege and he needed  
a job so he started teaching
 and who has just changed his 
li fe.  He decided a year 
ago to go back to sch
ool, s o he is now at Whart on and
 he is going in f or a bus i ness  
degree.  In fact, this
 weekend, we we re in, in Phil
adelphia visiting with him because 
he had asked us to 
c om e and s i t in on a day  of  hi
s classes, which is extremely 
interesting, it's so
me school, Wharton, it really  
is.  Very high-powered and the 
people, the young people, they ar
e very bright, very quick.  
It's really, it's satisfying 
to see so many intelligent 
and quick-witted people who ar
e going to be, you know,  
running our business world.  I 
think it 's sort of satisfyi
ng.  He  seems, I don't thin k 
any body c ould t e ll that he is a sur v iv or, t h
at he is the c h ild of a s urv iv or of t he 
Holocaust.  I don't think he wa
s affected by it. 
 He has  his pr oblem s lik e  ev ery b od y  
else has their problems and he
 has his areas of tensions
, I'm sure, but I would say 
that, touching wood, Er ic  functions as
 an extremely well-
adj us ted and h appy 
individual.  Our daughter I th
ink, bore more of the brun
t of it.  Maybe it's because 
she's more sensit ive an
d she digs around in th
e past  more.  She's very interest ed in 
what  do y o u call it, in fam i
ly  tr ees  and t h ings  lik e t h at
 and I  c o uld not pr ov ide h er  
____ knowledge.  I c
ould not provide her wi
t h a f am i ly back gr ound, of c ours e.    I 
think it bother ed her alway s, ok ay ?  But 
she married somebody 
from the midwest, 
who has a very long lineage
, which can be documented
 and goes all 
the way back 
to Sc
ot land, he' s a Sc otc h m a n and s o 
s h e' s  per fect ly happy 
and she digs around 
in his family trees and that keeps her happy
.  With her I think 
that she, she bore 
mor e the br unt of it bec a
us e, f i rst of all bec a us e 
she wa s older and secondly 
bec aus e s h e t ak e s t h ings  har d er t han our 
son does and I think she's convinced that 
my hav i ng been a Holoc a ust  s u
rv iv or,  in s p it e of t h e f ac t  
that she didn't know about 
it f or t h e f i rst 10 y ear s of  her lif e, ha
d a big effect on her  beca us e I was  too 
protective, I worried too much
 about, you know, that she s
houldn't  catch cold, that 

she should eat the right things
 and things like th
at.  But then I poi
nt out there is  
plent y of Amer ic an m ot her s 
who do the same thing, so 
I don't know 
whether she' s 
right or not and I think it's futile to even
 s pend too m u c h ener gy disc us s ing it.   If 
that' s what  she wants t o belie
ve,  t hat' s ok ay,  but Laur a he
y,  ther e's noth
ing I can do  
about it.  My past is my pa
st, you know.  Yo u're just goi
ng to have to accept it  the 
way I 'm ac cept ing it.  I think 
s h e has m or e diff ic ul
ty accepting my pa
st than I do. 
However, maybe with age, that
 will fade also, ok
ay?  I think one of
 the things that 
bother s her  the m ost  is
 that she is fearful 
and she is scare
d, but if she 
had to be in 
my shoes, she would not have
 survived.  And no
 amount of my te
lling her, "Laura, 
nobody knows what they can 
do when they have
 to do it  and 
nobody can, with 
certainty predict t
hat if I do this, this or this, I will 
survive.  It's a lo
ttery and you hav e 
to take it the wa y it come
s."  I don't think she quite 
buys it and she feels ill equipped 
to have s ur viv ed t h e s am e th
ings that I survived, which,
 you k now, no matt er what I  
tell her about it, that 
I don't know how I did it  either
 and if  you had to do it, you 
probably could do it too and 
nobody knows in advance. 
 It doesn't matter how much 
I reinf or ce that, s he has her 
ideas that she is not quit e 
up to snuff to
 survive in 
something like that and fina
lly my answer is, well I 
hope y ou nev er hav e to an d 
that's it, you know, 
because there's nothin
g els e I c an do about 
it.  So I think she 
has been affected by it
 in that, in that way.
  I don't know what 
it' s called,  _____.   I  
thin k maybe she should join a 
group of childr
en of Ho locaust surviv
ors.  In fact, I 
have mentioned it  once, bu
t I don't know whether she will
 or not.  Right now she's 
muc h t o o busy , s h e has t w o c h ildren, s he 
just finished her 
Master's degree in 
couns e ling and s he' s going t o do art ther ap
y.  Right now she 
has, she works two 
and a half days a  week wi
th disturbed teenagers, wher
e she does art therapy and 
she has two small children.  I don't think 
she can take, take on 
anything more.  And 
she's, also she join
ed, even though she is
 married to a Quak
er, a non-Jew,  she 
joined t he t em ple, t h e loc a l t emple wher e 
t h ey ar e members and she's ver y act i ve  
in the temple, so I think she has plenty to
 do r i ght  now and I 'm 
not even suggesting 
any m or e t hat s h e s h ould 
do anything else.  As a re
sult,  we have j o ined t heir  
temple too, which is in no
rt hern Virginia,  because we 
f e lt t h at, s i nc e our son wa s  
out of t o wn right now any how
, we might just as
 well spend t he 
holidays a
nd go t o  
temple where our daughter is. 
 In fact, she's much more 
obs erv ant than I ever was.  
Ever y Fr iday she light s  cand
les wit h the c h ildr en and she 
say s the pr ay er ov er wine 
and br ead.   At least  once
 a month t hey take t he 
kids t o what t h ey  call 
Tutshabat(ph), you know, services for th
e whole family .  She goes to all t he 
funct i ons at  the t em p le
 and she has joined a 
group,  I f or g ot what 
it's called, they ar e 
young people wh o are studying Judaism 
and how, what Jews
 now can do and 
expect of Judaism.  And she 
com m itt e d hers elf, she went t o s ev er a l s em inar s.  Yo u 
have to commit yourself, I th
ink it's an arm of UJA who 
is doing that and it 's, she 
feels very Jewish and she feels very pr ou
d t o be a J e w, bec aus e t here 's s o muc h  
intellectual accomplishments amongst th
e Jews.  Our son is non-practicing, 

however  he s ur pr is e d me gr eat ly,  he got 
mar r ied, when he got  m arr ied,  he m ar r ied  
also a non-Jew, but the, a 
rabbi married them and s
he accepted to raise the 
children Jewish.  In fact she committed hersel
f volunt ar ily.  
 But that's immaterial at 
this point bec a us e s h e' s div orc e,  ev en t
hough we still continue
 t o  see my f o rmer 
little daughter-in-law becaus
e I m e an, she was part of t h
e f am i ly , you know.   So w e  
still ar e in t ouc h with her. 
 He's not, but we ar
e.  He is now at W h art on and he is  
very much career bound now,  
to make his way, wh at he
's doing, but he surprised 
us, he c a lled on Yom Kippur 
t o say he was f ast ing.  So
, you know, I guess he's not 
a practicing Jew, but he's 
a Jew and I think he knows 
he's a Jew and I think he will 
cont inue t h e tr adit ion.  So th
at pleases me.  Anything else?
 
Q: What k i nd of  role did J u
daism play wit h t h em gr owi
ng up and wit h y o u and your  
family?
 
A: They went to, well
 when we lived in Ne
w York they went to, 
my daughter went to 
religious school, my son was too young.  Sh e went to religious school, she's a very 
quick study and she's very
 br ig ht, s o s h e  wa s le ar
ning Hebrew and she wa s 
learning all the songs.  An d 
she st ill k nows t h em.  T h en,
 when we mo
ved here, we 
joined a congregation, wh
ich wa s Bethesda Jewish Co
ngregation, whic h was  a 
very strange cong
regation and not too successful 
f or us , bec a us e t he k i ds  hat ed  
religious school so much, it was so poor ly
 organized and so poo
rly done, that they 
absolutely refused to be bar mitzvahed.  
And we decided not to
 f or ce t h e is sue.  
Now my daughter is, has volunt
arily come back to 
it and I'm hoping 
that my son will 
do the same thing.   When he
 was getting married and he
 married a non
-Jew, I said, 
"J ust  don't  for get  wher e I c ome fr om, t h at' s
 all I'm asking of you."  And he said,  
"Mom, I promise I won't."  An d I th
ink that's good eno
ugh for me, so.
 
Q: What about you personally
 and how your id
eas changed about 
Judaism, after?
 
A: Yes, yeah, well I must 
say, I  was a ver y reluct ant 
Jew, if you go back in my 
hist or y, the way t h e Jews 
grabbed me away from Po la
nd, I was a very reluctant 
Jew,  but  I have slowly come
 back to it.  I've 
never denied it, but I ne
ver practiced it. 
I think I'm som e what mor e J e wish or ient ed 
no w,  I re a l iz e th
at we ar e a s m all 
minority who has accomplished
 enormous things in spit e 
of all the difficulties.  I 
think t h e c limat e is c hanging
 als o and t h at Jews  ar e goi
ng t o be mor e
, treated wit h 
mor e r es pect, at least I hope.   W e ar e v er y
 much identified with Jewish causes in  
the city and we do 
belong to a temple , w
her e we f eel t hat, we
 don't, we go there 
bec aus e Laur a want s t o be m or e pr act i cing
 and we go for the 
holidays and we tak e  
the c h ildr en ther e, you know, f or  Suk ot e( ph)
 and ______ and things
 like that.  So I 
thin k, plus the fact, oh ther
e wa s something else happened.
  I went, a friend asked 
me to go to bible clas
s with them, given by a 
woman in her home, Naomi 
Rosenblatt, about whom yo
u m i ght have r e ad about bec a us e s h e just c am e out  
with a book,  Wrestling with
 Angels?  Yeah.  Well I t
ook some bible 
classes and I  

think t h at s ort of als o helped
 me along a little 
bit.  It sort of port
rays the Jews as a 
mixed lot, you know, it doesn'
t try to gloss over the im pe
rfections and I decided that 
they ar e people,  lik e ever y body 
else and you have to sort 
of  identify yourself with 
them.  So  it has helped me to
 sort of get back into the 
fold also, the bible classes.
 
Q: Okay, I j ust want to go ba
ck f or a m oment and t a lk a li
ttle bit more ab
out some of 
the difficulties in making 
t he t r ansit ion to t h e Stat es.
 
A: Well the first diff
ic ulty I had t o gr apple wit h wa
s language, when 
I came to the 
United St ates, you know, how to learn 
the language quickly, 
because even when 
you speak a language, for instanc
e, you don't think 
of stupid little  thin gs like, we 
would go out in a gr
oup together and they
 would say,  tell j o
k es and I wouldn' t  
understand the joke, 
okay?  So  you sort of
 feel out of it , you 
feel like the outsider  
and I must say that, even in
 the United St ates, whic h 
has greet e d me wit h such 
warmth and accepted me, you 
know, people accepted me 
ev er y where, I  v er y of ten 
do f eel like the out s ider.  Lik e t h ey r em ini
sc e, wit h a gr eat deal of nost algia abo u t  
the good old days of ce
rtain songs, or the big bands and
 I'm looking li
ke, you must 
be k i dding, what ar e y ou talk ing about, y ou 
k now, I c a n't  ev en f i gur e out what they  
are talking about.  Oh, I re
member when we were in, 
living in New Yo rk and a 
gr oup of  us , eight of us, w
ent  t o see J udy G ar land, was s i nging at one of  t he,  the 
big, the big theaters and we
 went  to s e e her and I t h o
ught she wa s awful,  she was 
drunk, she couldn't sing 
and everybody was clapping an
d standing up and giving 
her.  It' s t h e nost algia of t he past  whic h 
I am not s h ar ing wit h
 anybody, even with 
people who are very close to 
me, like my husband
, I am not sharing 
the nostalgia of 
the past.  I know I am an ou
tsider whenever they
 talk about school 
days or songs or 
music or the musical theater, I'm the outsider
.  But that's one thing I have to accept, 
I mean it' s not so bad,  act u
ally, to have t o ac cept t ha
t.  So that 's one ar ea wher e I 
felt  out of it , plus the fact I had to le ar
n the language very quic
kly.  There are other 
way s, y o u k now, which,  there ar e t i mes wh
en I  feel, when I read 
about what's going  
on in Bosnia for instance, I 
feel such, I have such a de
s p er ate f eeling that, why ar e 
people doing that to other peo
ple?  Yo u know, I still am
 trying to understand t he 
cruelt y t h at men ar e c a pable of.  
 It's, I think it's 
affect ing me more than it 's affect ing 
other people.  I have re
ached the point where I can't, I 
simply  cannot, couldn't read 
about what  was going on in 
Bos n ia, or about what was going on in ot her count r ies  
in Africa and places like th
at.  I've, it , I took it  too 
personally, you know.  Probably 
much more personally  than 
Amer ic ans by and lar ge woul
d t ak e it  because I liv ed 
through something like tha
t.  It's still inco
mprehensible to me
 and I cannot 
understand that it 's still goi
ng on, that people are still do
ing things like that.  So 
that' s an area where it 's gi
v i ng me a great  deal of dif f ic
ulty.  I sort of, I protect 
myself.  I don't read 
about it , I don't wa nt 
to know the details, I'
m s t ay ing away fr om  
it.  It's cowardly, but 
it,  that 's t h e only way  I can work
 it.  There are 
ways also that, 
you k now, t here ar e t i mes when I  hav e a lot 
of self doubts, you 
know, I haven't, I'm 

not alway s,  I'm pr ett y well as s ur e d and I 
am  ver y s elf reliant, but t here ar e times  
when I feel I'm in si
tuations where I feel
 I haven't been equipped 
right for them.  For  
the longest time, although th
at's less and less, I had 
the most tremendous gaps in 
my learning and knowledge, yo
u know, like history, I didn'
t le arn about 
it, I  didn't 
start until I was 11 years old 
to learn how to read and wr
ite, so conse
quently I have 
enormous gaps of knowledge in places 
whic h most people feel 
very confident an d 
very comfortable in 
and I'm not, you know. 
 So then I ha
ve to pedal 
back and say, 
"Oh, I hav e  got t o inf o rm mys e lf on t h is. " 
 So I am alway s play ing  cat ch up.  No 
matter what I'm doing, I'm 
playing catch up, okay?  Bu
t at this point I'm quite 
comfortable because I have 
noticed that other friend
s of mine, who have had a 
pretty normal life, play
ing catch up in many 
ways too.  So, but it
 took awhile for me 
to feel that I'm not the only one wh o has 
to play c at c h up.  
There is no such a 
pers on, who has an enormous 
amount of k nowledge in 
ev ery ar ea and t h ey  ca n 
feel confident in ever
y area, you know.  Most people ha
ve gaps in areas.
  So that's 
anot her one.  W h en I' m feelin
g disturbed, wh en I'm feelingupset or things
 like that, 
I can very well go 
through very disturbe
d nights where I'm drea
ming and most of 
the time I'm dr eaming that my life is in
 danger, which I don't 
thin k most people who 
hav e had a norm al life, do dr
eam about that.  My
 life is in dang
er and I'm running 
for my life, you know.  It's 
a ver y unc omf ortable f eeling t o hav e, but  I hav e t o d ea l  
with that.  It's not uncommo
n for me to wa ke up in a 
sweat because somebody has 
been chasing me and
 has been shooting
 at me.  I have 
to get over it.
 
Q: Have you had, because
 I r e mem ber  dr eams play ed 
such an important role in 
your survival in a wa y, ha
ve you had even dreams abou
t people from the past at 
all?
 
A:  All along my life, yeah, I 
do dream about people from th
e past, people 
in France I 
have known, occasionally a pe
rson will surface who 
I think is either 
my father of my 
mot her , but  it 's  not  v er y c o here
nt and it ' s not ver y c lear,  
but I do, yes, I definitely do 
dream about people in the past.
 
Q: Anot her thing t h at st rikes 
me is,  and y o u s ort of touc
hed on it earlier about how 
diffic ult it was for 
you t o, y o ur hus band 
had to convince you 
t o act u ally buy a 
house?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: How do you look at ev en, 
home and how was t h at  trans i
t i on, it s e em s that it  
would have been a difficult 
one.  Maybe you can talk a
bout t hat  a litt le bit more.
 
A: Yeah,  I'm not very much attached to mate
rial objects, you know
, it 's, it's sort of, 
it 's almost like they are on 
loan to me, you know.  So I have a car now.  It took me a 
long t im e t o  get , acquir e a c ar, have a c ar, 
but it' s only an obj ect
 and it ' s on loan to 

me, somehow.  My homes hav
e alwa ys been like that, yo
u know, they 
are on loan 
to me, they are not pa
r t  of  m e.  I k now t hat  m any of
 my friends, thei
r homes are so, 
or their possessions are so 
im port ant t o them, y ou know, it ' s a great comfor t t o  
them.  T o me it 's  not  really t h at muc h  
of  a comf ort,  poss es s ions.  Yes, diam onds ,  
because I can pack them in
 and run.  So you know, a 
diamond is to me a priz ed 
possession because it 's someth
in g I can take with me and 
it will feed me for awhile.  
Not becaus e it' s a diamond, but bec aus e it
's going to feed me 
for awhile.  Other 
things don't really c
ount.  My son always te
ased me, he cooks, he
 likes to cook, my 
son and he is t h e one who a
lways  had t o go ou
t with my husba
nd and buy all the 
kitchen gadgets, because I nev
er had the kitchen gadgets. 
 I cooked, but I always 
make do with what I had, 
I never needed a million gadget
s like most cooks I kno w  
need, y o u know.  T h ey pr ov
ided me with th
e gadget s.  Other wise t h ey k new I 
wasn't going to go out and buy the gadgets.  
So, it 's sort of that
 and also when we 
had childr e n, y o u k now it 's 
f u nny to m ent ion it bec aus e 
I don't know whether people 
think of t h at .  I had a har d tim e having mo
r e t han t w o children, bec a us e I only hav e 
two hands and if I needed to
 run, I wa s going to grab 
a child with each hand and 
run.  So for me, more than two children wa
s out of the question.
  Ho w could I hav e  
run with three children?  That
 wasn't going to be feasible
.  So t hat ' s why we hav e  
two children.  I happen to like 
children a lot, it 's j ust t h at , 
that thing,  that f i xed ide a  
that if I had to run, I onl
y have two hands and two child
ren I can manage, but more 
than that I can't.  So that's 
anot h er, y o u k now, t here ar e li
ttle things like that which 
you don't think of.  I used 
to dr ive m y k i ds  crazy if 
t h ey had a r as h, I was alway s  
there wit h t he powder,  you k now,  the Amm e
n' s powder.   I just dr ove t h em cr az y  
with that, because to me 
having a rash was dangerous, 
because if  you had a ras h , 
you got yourself  shot, becaus
e it  meant you had,
 y o u had cont act,  c ontract ed  s om e 
dis e as e and t hey weren't  going 
t o fool ar ound, to hav e 
the whole bar rac ks inf ect ed ,  
so t h ey wer e going t o shoot y o u.
  So to me a rash is an 
ugly thing, life threatening, 
abs o lut e ly life t hr e atening, s o  that ' s anot he
r.  You know, you have
 thos e t h ings t hat 
ar e very, come out in small ways, you know
, very unexpect
ed ways really, that they 
com e out.
 
Q: Do you have to sort of catch yourself doing this ?
 
A: Ye s, oh absolutely, yeah 
and in the end I made a jok e 
of it, you know, that's th e 
only thin g you can do about i
t, make a joke of it really
, so.  Also I think it  has 
affected my friendshi
ps.  I'm only, I 
will not be friendly with
 somebody 
on whom I 
cannot have confidence and 
count on.  I have to be able 
to rely on some
body.  If I 
hav e s omebody who I not ice is
 not reliable, they do not ,
 they are not amongst my 
best friends.  You 
know, they are  acqu
aintances, but I will
 never make a good 
friend of s om ebody who is not
 a very reliable person.  
Most of my friends are 
extremely reliable, so.
 

Q: T e ll me som e ot her  way s y o u t h ink t he 
Holocaust sort of pl
ay ed int o y o ur life.
 
A: I'm very self-reliant.  I think for the lo
ngest time it drove Ji
m cr azy t hat I would 
never take anybody's word for something, 
you know I would liste
n and then I would 
usually try to make up
 my own m i nd and it' s ver y diff ic
ult for me to fo
llow somebody 
else's advice unless I 
have really given it 
some thought a
nd decided that it  wa s very 
good advice, that it  
made sense and that I ha
ve internalized it.  I'm not a follower, I 
can't follow, because following
 would have meant death to
 me, I had to make up my 
own mind whether I wa
s going to go on the right or 
the left, because the right might 
be death and the le ft might be life.  So  it 
can be diffic ult for a 
spouse, you know, that 
you hav e t o m ak e up your 
own mind about everything. 
 I think I have somewhat 
soft ened it, you k n ow, bec aus e 
if  person, if  people have pr
oven themselves to have 
ver y good j udgm e nt and t o gi
ve me very good advice, I'm 
more likely t o take that  
ad vice no w.  But when I was younger, n
ope, I wouldn't take 
anybody's advice, I 
wouldn't take anybody's 
word for anything.  I 
had to really make su
re f or myself that  
wher e I st epped was saf e.  
An d it can be unnervin g fo
r a pers on who has lead a 
normal lif e  to com e acr o ss somebody like
 t hat , it was v ery unner ving f or m y  
husband.
 
Q: Ho w did it affect your ma
rriage, because you said that 
you didn't tell Jim init ially 
about it, so if you we
re to act li
ke that, I was wondering how 
he would figure out that 
that was where it was com i ng fr om?
 
A: Well, he knew.
 
End of Tape 1
 

 Tape2
 
Q: Okay, let's start again wi
th how the, your experienc
e affect ed your marr iage ,  
your r e lat ionsh
ip with Jim.
 
A: I don't know whet
her my experience, we
ll it probably did in 
one way and that is , 
having been a survivor, I realiz ed that surv
iving meant helping 
each other, okay? 
You didn't surviv e unless y
ou got help and consequentl
y I probably was of much 
more help to him than an
 Am eric an wife would have
 been.  Jim had his problems 
gett ing adjusted t o 
work and working for other people, he never 
could work well for 
other people and I wa s a
lways a partner to him 
in that respect becau
se first of all, I 
understood very qu
ickly what was bothering him and
 I was able to, he wa s able t o  
talk things over with me.  He never made a 
m ov e in his c ar eer wit hout talk ing it ov er  
with me and withou
t getting my help.  I think that 
Holocaust survivor
s, at least my 
im pression is, have an enorm
ous am ount  of empat hy f o
r others and for their 
pr oblem s.  May b e I'm gener a liz i ng too mu
ch, maybe I ' m just 
speaking, I have an 
enormous amount of 
empathy for other peopl
e and their problems
 and certainly for  
a spouse's problems.  So, c
onsequently I think 
I wa s more helpful
 to him than I 
th in k a n A m er ic a n sp ou s e wo
uld have been.  So
 in that respect, 
he got the benefit 
of my having been a 
Holo caust surviv or.  The same 
time, he probabl
y got some of 
the dr awbacks , lik e I was m uc h mor e c a ut ious
.  But I wasn't caut
ious t o the poin t  
wher e I  c ould, I would call hi
m back, bec a us e as a m att er of
 fact when he
 went int o  
bus i ness  f o r him s elf, I  r em ember  s i tting wit h
 friends and a friend
 saying, "How could 
you let him do that?  I woul
d never let Les go in
to business for himself, it's too 
thr eat ening."  I c ould do it, bec a us e I k new
 ho w im p or t a nt it wa
s to him, you see 
and I k n ew that it was  import ant f or him t o
 do work that was 
satisfying and where 
he was happy.  So I could, yo
u k now I could help him.  In
 fact I help him very muc h  
when he went into business 
for himself.  In
 other ways, I pr
obably had more 
patience than most normal people, 
quote, normal people would have.
 
Q: What about the self -relia nt part
 you wer e talk ing about befor e ?
 
A: Yeah.  Well that annoyed
 him very often, that I wa
sn't more dependent on him, 
you know.  Our gene
ration, wo men were 
much more 
dependent on men and men 
liked that.  I think Ji
m missed it to a certain extent, 
that I was so com p let ely self-
reliant and didn't depend 
on him.  I had to l
earn to soften it a li
ttle bit, you know.
 
Q: When you say self -relia nt
 and not dependent on him,
 do you mean em
otionally, 
or ?
 
A: In many wa ys, different ways.  Emot
ionally, opening doors 
for myself or doing 
things for myself, you know and emotiona
lly too, y ou know, no
t bein g, not being 
that reliant on him.  F ee
ling I have t o make my own 
way, I have to, you know, I 

have to stand on 
my own t w o f eet , I c a n't,  in a wa
y, probably without him knowing it, 
that was good for him, bec aus e 
it allo wed, it liberated him 
to do his own t h ing.  But I 
thin k there were times wher
e he was annoyed because I 
was so independ
ent.  And 
I softened it and he got used 
to it.  So I think what it 
sounds like is 
like a normal 
marriage, doesn't it ?
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: I don't think there was 
anything abnormal about it.
 
Q: Yeah.  How long ha
ve you been married?
 
A: 40 years.  It will be 40 
years this June.  That's a lo
ng time, yeah, 
that's a ver y  
long time.  I don't know.  Well
, another positiv e fallout from
 my past is that I'm very 
observant, because I had to learn, my life 
depended on it and that
 stood us in very 
good stead when we
 went into business 
together and in other 
ways.  I could rea d  
people's reactions very quickly
 and many a time 
we would go into 
negotiations and 
I would be sit t ing t her e and 
m en were wonder ing, "W hat 
is he doing wit h his  litt le 
wif e ther e?"  You k now and 
I would listen very carefully 
and then I woul
d play back 
to him what happen
ed and tell him that we
 had to do t h is or  that  bec aus e t h is is 
what I observed.  I do
n't think he would have
 observed that and 
as a matter of fact, 
he said  so, he never 
would have observed i
t.  It was sort of un
c o mfort a ble, here I  
was, a whole room full of
 men and me, you know and
 sometime ever ybody was 
look ing,  I am s uppos e d t o get  up and get co
ffee only I'm not gett
ing up to get coffee 
you k now, I'm s itt ing t here list ening.  But af
ter awhile it  became
 normal for us to 
oper at e as a team lik e  that 
and even the Japanese
 got used to it, they didn't know 
what to make of us when 
we got ther e, y ou know, who 
goes first, me or him? 
When we hav e to m arc h into t he pr es iden
t' s off ic e, who goes 
f irst, Jim or me? 
They were completely co
nfused.  I think it  br
ought more advantages than 
dis a dv antages.  I 'm s ur e ther e wer e dis a
dvantages, I'm 
sur e t h at I  was much less 
spontaneous than
 normally  brought up people woul
d be, but on the other hand, I 
brought all th
e advantages.
 
Q: What would y ou obs erv e when you wer e s i
tting there?  Give 
us some examples.
 
A: I would observe people and what, how th
ey reacted, their fa
cial expressions and 
how they reacted and I read 
people pretty well.  My surv
ival depended on it, to read 
people we ll.  So I can, I c
an make a pretty sh
rewd guess, usually, about what they 
wanted out of a deal or what
 they we ren't going
 to give up and,
 you know and be 
helpful in that way.
 
Q: Was your observatio
ns usually correct?
 

A: Yes.  Yeah, he lear ned 
how to r e ly on them c om p
letely because they were 
usually pretty correc
t.  My readings were 
pretty correct, yeah.
 
Q: It sounded like you have this, 
it 's almost I guess a gift, in
 a way, of seeing things, 
or s ort of perc ept i on t h at' s ver y s h ar p.
 
A: Right.
 
Q: How else did that work into your life?
 
A: Maybe being more unde
rstanding, you know, u
nderstanding more whe n  
somebody was having difficul
t ies deliv er ing on times, 
you know and doing things 
like our employees, I was, ra
ther than firing them, I wa
s more apt  to moving them 
ar ound fr om job t o j o b to s ee if we c
ould f i nd a spot f or t hem, y ou k now what I  
mean?  I  did a lot  of  t h at an
d that was usually on
 my advice, you know, let's not  fire 
them, they're not working well
, but let's try to see if we
 can f it t hem in s om e wher e 
els e.  So t h at' s anot
her way it would wo rk.
 
Q: What about your children?
 
A: Well they claim that I wa
s a very strict mo
ther.  An d at the 
beginning Laura would 
say, "That's because you're 
Fr ench, "  and I  said, "You'r e 
right, that's fine."  You 
know, it  didn't matter, I woul
d be v ery  str i ct, s he had to 
be home by a certain time, 
she didn' t  like it.  We had t o
 eat our meals as a family , y
ou know, t h ey want ed t o, to 
eat on the run and run out 
and we' d, why did we hav e to
 eat dinner together, you 
hav e t o eat  dinner  t oget her,  bec a us e t h
at's when we are sitt
ing down and talk ing 
toget her.  So, and the ot her 
thing is that we 
nev er went  off on t o o many v ac at i ons 
with our children, wi
thout our children, you know, fri
ends of ours w
ould go off and 
leav e the k i ds, y ou k now, eit her wit h a gr and
parent, we didn't ha
ve a grandparent to 
leav e t hem  wit h, or wit h a 
maid and I never di
d that, I never had 
a full time maid,  
you know, I only had help, but I 
didn't hav e a full time m a id
 taking care of children, I 
was always  ther e and 
consequently our chil dren alwa ys 
came on vacation with us. 
We had to travel without th
em on business and that I had
 t o and I had no c hoic e ,  
but if it was  for pleas ur e or 
vacation, they always came with
 us.  As  a matt er of  fact  
Er ic  and Laura came to 
Europe when he wa
s seven years old and she was 11, 
bec aus e I went  t o Eur ope.   
And we m a de many t r ips toget
her, to England, to Italy, 
to France.   By t he tim e t h
ey were teenagers, 
they had alre
ady traveled and they 
were always traveling 
wit h us.   As  a c ons e
quence, our kids spent 
a lot of time with 
us.  I think that's probably wh
y.  I know that my friend 
complain they 
don't want to 
go with them anywhe
r e.  O ur k ids ar e t h e ones wh
o suggested, we 
have m ade it  
now a f am i ly  tradit i on that 
f or Memorial Day we
 all go away together, with all the 
childr en.  We us ed to all 
go away at Christ
mas time, between Christmas and New 
Year when Er ic  was still in
 college and Laura was already
 married, un
til Laura had 

a child.  We always went aw
ay for a week to Vermont, to
gether.  We s
pent a lot of 
time with the fa
mily.  Birthdays are alwa ys a big ce
lebration, you know, it 's like a 
thr ee,  it' s like a Polis h  wedd
ing.  Fr om t h e tim e t h ey we
re very little
, they had a 
party wher e t hey inv it ed all 
their friends and they played
 games, they had one day 
when they want ed to go to the favorite re
staurant for dinner, just
 the family and one 
day wher e I had to m ak e their f av or it e di
s h at hom e.   So it' s was always thr ee 
celebrations for each birthday
.  Our daughte
r complained that when she went off to 
and I wa s ____ too, when 
she went off to college, 
nobody made a big deal about 
the birthday and she felt very 
let down, you know. 
 So I, so they 
were, I was sitting 
there, getting reproaches th
at we made too much of a 
big deal about birthdays an d 
so when they went off to 
college, suddenly the rest of 
the world didn't sit up an d 
take notice of it.  
I said, "Well, you will forgive me, 
I hope, you know,that I made a 
big deal about it. "  J im  di
dn't have a very happy childh
ood, he can't ever remember 
a birthday party, his parents haven't give
n him, so consequen
tly his birthday is 
alwa ys cele brated with a gr
eat deal of fanfare.  So we
 have those big 
celebrations, 
the fam ily.  We ar e a small 
family, but we alwa
ys hav e lot s of c e lebr at ions.   So 
that's a way of, of _____.  Another way th
at I can notice now wi
th my grandchildren 
is, and that's not too 
good, it 's almost like I see in 
my little granddaugh
ter, me as a 
child and I am so prot ect i ve of
 her that I  am dr iv
ing her mot her  cr azy 
at times.  So I 
had to take a step back
 and say, "Cool it."  
Okay?  I am very prot
ective of her.  I will 
notice much faster than he
r mother when she is not we
ll.  You know, when she ha s 
a c old brewing or s om et hing and I will sa
y, "Laura, I think she's coming down with 
som et h ing. "   You k now, bec a us e I  am so,  
I'm  like a hawk ov er her
.  It's not good. 
So I am s o rt of try i ng to st ep bac k and 
not, my daughter'
s much more laid back. 
She had a cold, she ha
s a cold, she will go to school
 anyhow, you know.  I would 
never do that, but 
I have to step back and
 say well, that's her 
way of running thin gs, 
ok ay ?  So.
 
Q: One thing I wanted to ask 
you about is  you were born 
in Germany, 
wher e do y ou 
cons ider y o urs e lf, y o u say the k i ds said, " W
ell, you're from Fran
ce, " so t a lk about  
that, how that affected you.
 
A: Well, I told  everybody I wa s from 
France because it w
ould have been too 
complicated an explanation 
and telling m y life st or y t o
 everybody who asked me 
where I was from.  It was easi
est to say I came 
from France becaus
e I spent quite a 
few y e ars t here and I went t o
 school there, so conseque
ntly, and I  lik e d Fr ance, I  
really liked it, so it was ve
r y easy f or me t o say, I gr ew
 up in France, 
but I was born 
in Germ any  and t hat ' s us ually what I tell pe
ople and it's pretty a
ccurate.  You  know, 
because I don't have, 
I cannot tell them all the detour
s I made, it's 
just too many  
and it would tell that, you 
know, when you star
t with one ... so how
 come you were  
there and how come 
y ou wer e t h er e.  It would be v ery  
difficult for me 
to explain that 

wit hout t e lling m y st or y to ev ery b ody and I 
don't like to do it. 
 I want ed t o make a 
point, what was t h e point about ? 
 
Q: Considering that you're no
t from anywhere, you feel?
 
A: I don't, I feel like I'm a 
visitor everywhere, 
I'm not American, ho
wever I have live d  
in this country longer than in
 any ot her country.  I ' ve 
lived in this 
c o untr y f or 40 
year s.  I'm  not a t ypic a l Am er
ican,  but I'm  not  a t y
pical anything.  I consider myself a 
little bit like a visitor.  Maybe a permanent visitor, but I'm a visitor none the less 
bec aus e I didn't gr ow up her e 
and I don't have all 
the c ost um es  of  this c ountr y.  I  
fe lt th e s a me wa y in Fra n ce ,
 ev en m or e s o  because I was s t ill lear ning F r ench, I  
wasn't an adult and 
I was much more self-consc ious 
about it.  Here, in the United 
St ates, t her e ar e s o m any more f or eigners
 and so many more 
str a nger s, I mean 
the whole United Stat es is 
s ort of an am algamat i on of stranger s ,  I feel mo re 
comfortable.  In France, if 
I liv e d in Fr anc e now, I pr ob
ably would find my own level 
in the city, I probably 
would find people with a variety 
of backgrounds 
and I would fit 
mys e lf in t he r e t o o, b ut 
I don't f eel like Fr anc e is my  hom e c ountry, G erm an y  
definitely not.  Any of the 
other countries I w
ent through, like 
Poland, Ukraine an d 
Cz echoslo vakia, not at all, you know, they
 ar e f oreign c ountr ie
s to me and I t h ink  
the Un it ed St ates is  where I'm fee
ling t h e m o st c omf ort able,  really .
 
Q: J ust  la s t ly , is  t her e  a nyt
hing that you have 
in  the St ates, th
at  you cons ider, 
almost something that, as 
a keepsake, or being in a co
untry where, you know, it 
really was  f or eign when you first  arr iv e d, 
was there anything that
 you held 
onto for 
memory's sake?
 
A: Well I certainly hold onto 
a lot of  m emor i es,  I hav e  lo
ts of memories.  I have 
books  in Fr enc h, whic h wer e giv e n t o m e  as 
gifts by friends when 
I was in Fr ance.   I 
got a first rate education in Fr ance and that
 stays with me.  It 
has made me int o a  
book lover, forever.  I am 
a very big reader, I 
read a lot of books 
and I belong to two 
different book clubs, where 
we  meet and discuss books 
that we read.  I can't 
im agine a wor ld wit hout boo
k s, s o I mean, wher e ev er  I go, I have m y fr iend s  
following me.  It's a very co
mforting feeling to have and 
I, if  I'm thr
ough reading and 
I don't have enough bo
oks on my night tabl
e, I have a very unc
omfortable feeling 
like, a little
 bit like a junkie who hasn
't gotten their fix.   I 
always have two or three 
books sittin g t
here that I'm go
ing to be reading, so that when
 I'm finished 
with one, I 
can go ont o anot her.  I would s ay t h at boo
k s ar e m y pac if i er and m y s ec ur it y  
blanket.  But that's not strict
ly, it ' s not repr esent at iv e of  any one c ountr y.  It's  just  
that I feel like anywhere
 I am,  if t h ey 'r e ar e boo
ks to be had and
 read, I'm 
comfortable, I have my security blanket  there, so.
 
Q: Okay, j u st one last
 question, what
 do you cons ider your
 identity to be now?
 

A: I think I cons ider m ys e lf a c it i z en of th
e wor ld.  I do like t he Unit ed St at es, I  fee l  
very comfortable here now,  I li
ke my life here, 
but I also liked Fran
ce and I, I fee l 
like I probably could live in an
y country if  I had to.  It woul
d take me a little longer to 
learn the la nguage now that I'm older, but 
I probably even would learn the language 
if I had to live in a
nother country.  But I 
would say that my str
ongest bond is
 to the 
United St at es bec aus e my childr e n ar e s o 
ty pic a lly Am er ican.  Bot h my c h ildr en are 
abs o lut e ly, typically  Amer ic an and s o ar e 
my grandchildren.  I th
ink I ought to tel l  
you a funny li ttle story abou
t, about my little granddaughter
.  My son-in-law is of 
Sc ot s, Sc ot ch or igin and his nam e  is Linl
ey MacGrew( ph), so 
my grandchildren are 
called M ac G rew( ph) .  Now, t h ey  go t o 
religious school an
d Amy has t o always 
explain, "My name is
 MacGr e w, but I'm Jewish" and 
then she elaborates on it, "My 
mommy's Jewish, my br other's Jewish, I'm 
Jewish,  but my father is not Jewish. " 
That 's  how she explains it, s o t h at' s a pr etty,  
that's a pr etty good fix to have on life, I 
think.  She has t h e r i
ght fix on life, so.
