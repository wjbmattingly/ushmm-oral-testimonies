Peter Gorog was bornin Budapest, the capital of  Hungary, in March, 1941 as Péter 
Grünwald. He changed his fam ily nam e in 1962 toGorog.T he arrow on this map
 
of  Europe points to 
Hungary. on this next m ap, the arrow points to Budapest.
 
Peter'sfather, Árpád Grünwald, worked as off ice manager at a Publishing House, while his 
m other, Olga Schönf eld,was a hat maker and she raised Peter.This was the lastpictureo
f  the fam ily 
together. Peter was 3 m onths old. 
 
Péter'sfather was conscripted to work in the
 
Hungarian  Forced Labor Battalion.here isa photo of the Forced Labor Battalion.  T he arrow 
to the left points to Péter's father, Árpád.
 
Around Decem ber of  1942 P
eter'sf ather was taken to Ukraine where he died.Péter andhis 
m other rem ained in Budapest during in time. In 1944 Germ anf orces invaded Hungary.  Péter and 

his m other were evictedfrom  their apartmentand went intohiding wi th a Christianfam ily.  Af ew 

days later aneighbordenounced them , the Hungarian gendarmeriearrestedPéter's m other andput 

her in jail. This is a historic photographf romOctober
 
1944of  Jewish wom en in Budapestarrested 
by Hungarian police.
 
T wo days af terher arrest, Péter'sm other escaped and she andPéter m oved intoan 
apartm ent safeguarded by Swedish diplom at RaoulW allenberg.  Later they f led tothe Budapest 

ghetto where they live d with som e of the Péter's other relatives until theend of the war.  In 

January
 
1945, Budapest was
 
liberated by the Soviet Arm y.
 
In 1946, Péter'sm other m ade plansfor them to emm igrate tothe United
 
S ta t e s.  W hile  in 
1949 while they were waiting f or their Visa, the Comm unist governm entf rom Hungary clo sed the 

borders. Péter grew up in Hungary.
 
In 198

years at NASA's 
Goddard spacef light center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Although Péter's mother hadattempted to

em igrateaf ter the war, they were unable to leave until his def ection in 1980.
  
W hile  in  Hun ga ry,  
Péter was eventually able to attend University and he earnedam aster's degree inelectrical 
engineering.  He was part of the team that built thef irst com puter designed com pletely by 

Hungarians.  His education and experiencem ade itpossiblef or Péter to remain and work in the U.S. 

following his defection until he received his green card and later became a U.S. citizen.
 
Péter who retired in 2014 spent 34
 
years in the com puterf ield in theU.S., spending m ost of 
h is tim e, a sI sa id, a t N
ASA's Goddard Space Flight Center where he worked onm ajor projects as 
L A NDS AT
 
T he Hubble SpaceT elescope, the Space Shuttle,and the Jam esW ebbTelescope, which is 
to be launched in2018.
 
Following his retirem ent last year,Péter becam e more actively in volved with this Museum and 
began volunteering here. He translates docum ents written in Hungarian and video testimonies of 

Holocaust survi vors and eyewitnesses. He describes his work as " very emotional."
 
Péterand his wif e Jorgy live in Maryland justoutside
 
ofW ashington, DC. T hey havef our 
daughters, Sarah,Laura, Anna, and Ilana.T hey lost their daughter Juliana when she was just two 

years old. Peter's daughter, Veronika,f rom  his earlier marriage in Hungary, li ves in Northern Virginia 

with her husband and
 
her two  daughters Monica, age7 andKatalina age 5.T hey area very 
clo se -

I am  pleased to let you know thatPéter is accom panied today by Jorgy and their daughters 
Laura, Anna, Ilana, and Laura's husband RobertW alburn. 
 
If you wouldn'tm ind, raise your hand so youknow where you are right you down there.  
T hank you.
 
Péter is just now beginning to speakpublicly about his Holocaust experience having 
previously spoken only at his children's schools. 
 
W ith that I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our First Person,Péter Gorog.
 
(applause).
 
>> Péter Gorog: Thank you. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Péter,thank you som uchf orjoining us.  For you tobe our "First Person"  
today, you have so much to share with us sowe wil l start right away. W orldWar II 
began, of  course, 
with Germ any and Russia invading Poland until September
 
1939.  Bef ore you turn to the war years 
andthe Holocaust, tell us a little bitf irstaboutyour f am ily and their life before the war.
 
>> Péter Gorog: Letme give just a little historical perspective.  I won't go back2,000
 
years 
butm aybe100, 150. In the m id 18th century, the Jewish populationof  Hungary enjoyed the 

f reedom , actually so much so thatm any Jews f rom other parts of Europef led to Hungary.
 
And this was thenature of Hungarian Judaism  lasted until the First W orldW ar when 
ever ything ended.  Unfortunately Hungary wa s under the losing side of  the war.  Hungary lost about 

60% of their territory and 3,000 Hungarians ended up beyond the Hungarian border whichcaused 

t r e m en do
us stress and troublef or Hungarians in generalandf or Jews specif ically.
 
My parents were born in 1907, both of them . T hey were born into Jewish f am ilies.  My f ather 
was born intoa (inaudible) Jewish fam ily.  It is ver y sim ilar to conservati ve Judaism . 
 
He re it  is  m o re  
liberal than the conservative one.
 
My m other was born into a very Orthodoxf amily.  M y great grandf ather was a rabbi ina small 
town in Hungary that is now part of Slovakia.
 
T hey agree up in afam ily, here we would call m iddle classf am ilies.  They went to high 
school. My f ather,he aspired to be a lawyer.   Unf ortunately he wasn't able tof ulf ill hisdream  

because after the war in Hungary, they enacted a law which was the very f irst anti
-
Jewish law in 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

Europe even bef ore thefam ous Nurem berg laws which restricted the participation of  Jews in higher 
educationtothepercentage of the general population which was about 5%.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So nom orethan 5% of the law school studentbodycouldbe Jewish?
 
>> Péter Gorog: That's correct. Andunfortunately m y father nevergot into the Universit y or 
law school.
 
My m om , she was always good with her hands.  She was a very sm art wom an. But shedidn't 
want to go to college or university.  So she went to trade schooland she becam e ahatm aker, 

m ill
iner. W hich was very f ashionable during the '20s and '30s and shem ade a very good living.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described tom ethat she was sort of  theblacksheep of herfam ily.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  I didn't know that it was going to come up.
 
(laughter).
 
Ye
s.  Ina way, she wa s, as I said
 
--
 
she grew up in a very Orthodox fam ily.  They kept all the 
dietary laws.  And am ong the custom s were that Jewish wom en before their wedding, they go 

through a ritual bath. And my m om  went to hers theday before theweddi
n g,  n o t  r em em ber in g o r  
thinking aboutthat in the m orning of the wedding she has to go to this ritual bath where she was 

im mersed in the water all the way down.  And shehad to godo it over again.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do itover again.
 
>> Péter Gorog: But she observed Jewish laws but notasm uch asher siblings I cam eto 
know.  It hadaneff ect on meas I grew up and I was searchingfor m y identity.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Péter,how large of anextendedfam ily did you have?
 

>> Péter Gorog:  My mom  had eight siblings. Of the eightones survived the Holocaust, two 
em igrated tothe United
 
States just bef ore the war.  My m om  andtwo of m y aunts. T he rest of them , 
onediedof  sickness even bef ore the war.  And the rest of them died af ter the Holocaust.
 
On m yf ather's side, unf ortunately, I don't have a lot to say about them becausem yfather 
died in 1942. So one of  hisbrothers
 
--
 
two of his brothers, one survi ved but thefam ily just lost the 
connectionduring and after the Holocaust with them .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before the war began, I thinkyou toldm e yourf ather eventually joined your 
m other inthe business.  Is that right?
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Yeah.  That's correct. He was a clerk in apublishing company. T hey 
thought maybe the hat
-
m aking business would be goodfor them working together.  Andmy f ather 
startedto study hat making, believe it or not. Andhe was very goodat it. But that never cam eto 

f ruition either because at the endof 1940, even before I was born,he was taken to the Forced Labor 

Battalion.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Péter,of  course, the war began in1939 September.  But thef ull bruntof  the 
war and the mass deportation of  Jews f rom Hungary didn't really get underway until 1944.  

Nonetheless, conditions worsenedf or Jews in 1939 and got increasingly worse f or yourf am ily and 

other Jews in Hungary f rom  then on.  Andthen, of course, as you said, your father was takenfor 

forced labor in1940.
 
T ell us what you can about the circum stances for you and yourf am ily once the war began 
andthen about yourf ather being conscriptedinto theLabor Battalion.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  My parents gotmarried in 1936, and I was born in1941.  My father was 
taken tothef orced labor camp at the endof 1940, bef ore I was born.  He was releasedfor two 

weeks afterm y birth.  And that picture was taken during that time.
 
I obviously don'thave personal memories, but I know about Hungarian history.  I know about 
the anti
-
Jewish laws they enacted starting f rom  1938 where they restricted the numberof  Jews who 
could work even atprivate companies.  No governm ent jobsfor Jews.  Actually the numbers were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
5
 
restricted inm any professions, lawyers, doctors. T hey couldn'tbeeditors of newspapersor any 
m edia.
 
Lateron,they enactedoperational laws just like the Nurem berg laws in Germ any, namely 
th a t 
ever ybody was qualif ied as Jewish whose at leastone grandparentwas Jewish which caused a lot 

of  problem  and caused a lot of  liesbecause itis part of the Hungarian history that Hungarian Jews 

start to assim ilateas much as they could. They changed
 
their German surnam e to Hungarian 
surnam e as I did later on.
 
T hey did actually voluntarily converted to Christianity.  So whenthewar cam e and all these 
J e wi s h  la ws
 
--
 
Je wish m alesbetween age 18 to 50 were taken tof orced labor cam ps, these people 
t ri e d
 
toprove that they were not Jewish and they subm ittedall kindsof  petitions tothe governm ent to 
declare them  Christians.  Som e of them  were born intofam ilies whic h were already converted to 

Christianity.  So they were baptized in churches, and they had
 
their baptism  certif icates.  
Nevertheless, it didn't save their lives.
 
T he reasonI know it, I'm  working with documents in the archives where thesepetitions are 
stored. And I'm  translating them . And through thepetitions, there is a stam p that says " re
jected, 
rejected, rejected."   Knowing what happensto these people, it is a very hard thing.
 
T hat's why as ourf am ily's concerned, m yf ather went to af orced labor camp.  My m om  
worked as hardas she could.
 
>> Bill Benson:  She was able to continue her work during that tim e?
 
>> Péter Gorog: That's correct.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Okay.
 
>> Péter Gorog: Andactually she couldeven afford to hiream aidwho took care of m e while 
she was working.  T his one didn't last long either because another law came out which p
rohibited 

non
-
Jewish people towork for Jews.  This one affectedm y m om  obviousl y and also affected a 
young gir l f rom  a village who lost her jobandher livelihood.
 
My m om  had to copewith the situationasmuch as possible.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did she know where your f ather was when he was takenfor f orced labor?
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Yesand no.  My f ather was ableto send postcards. T he postcards were 
obviously censored and they didn't let him wri te anything about the circumstances where he was.
 
So I canonly follow his movementf rom  the Hungarian archives where his battalion was 
recordedf rom time to tim e. Sounfortunately I do know that m y mom  didn't know m uch abouthim  

because at onepoint,after I was born,m y mom  started to write a diary.  She wanted to rem
em be r  
ever ything which happened to herand happenedtom e so at the time when she hoped that m y 

father would return she would be able to recount thefam ily history.  Fortunately she preserved that 

diary.  And I'm  in the process of translating it.  And if  them useum  needs it, I would donate it.
 
My m om  also preserved all the cards m yf ather sentbackf rom theforced labor cam ps.  So 
we have a glim pse of their life, what it was atthattim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you actually have all the postcards, including what you think is the very 
last one thathe was
 
--
 
he sent to her?
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Yes,I dohave.  And if timeperm its, I will just gi ve you a glim pseof  what 
happened to them  at that time. T his is the card, the last onem y mom  got.  It'sdated1942 

De c e
mber
 
10 .
 
And just a couple of quotesf rom the card, if Im ay.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hile you're looking for that,I was struck by how neat and small yourf ather's 
handwriting was.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Youcan see obviously he had to jam  asmuch inform ation as possible.  And 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
it's interesting, I didn'tnoticethat aspectof  the card.
 
I will have a little problem with Hungarianterm s of endearm ent,translating them because they 
m ight not com e out well in English.  But staywith m e.
 
My dear little squirrel
 
--
 
(laughter
) 
--
 
m y golden little Péter,he wrote the card toboth of us.  I 
got your cards and they causedm e greatpleasure andI ask youtowrite as oftenas possible 
because every line is a ver y special holidayf or m e. Your cardsarefull of  longing f orm e.  And 
c an  

you im agine how m uch I longf or youandf orour home.  Butfor the tim e being, we have tobe very 

patient. W ehave to wait and trusting the good Lord.  I cannotem phasize how m uch youhave to 

take care of your half .
 
And then she goesonandon.  And the last two paragraphs
 
--
 
and that was the lasttwo lines 
m y m om  readf rom him : I wish you a Happy New Year, a better one than theold one.  Ihopethat 

theboys are doing well.  And I send m y kisses to the ladies. Thoseare the wives of  thef riends. T o
 

dear Péterf rom Árpádwho loves you a lot.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hanks for reading thatf orus, Péter.
 
Knowing because they were censoredand you couldn't know actually a lot about whathis 
circum stances were like, generally what were  theyf orced todo when they went to these Forced 

Labor Battalions? W hat were their work conditions like?
 
>> Péter Gorog: W ell, what we know about them for those who survived andeyewitnesses 
anddocuments, they had very hard lives.  T hey were so
-
called (inaudible) unitsfor the
 
re gu l a r A rmy.   
And they had to do all the dirty work f or the Arm y.  They were the ones that hadtodig the ditches, to 

build roads, to cleanbuildings.  And they wer e the ones who once they got to Ukraine, Hungary 

joinedthe Nazi Germ any in the invasionof  the Soviet Union number
 
1941. The HungarianArm y and 
the ForcedLabor Battalions were taken to Ukraine. And they were the ones who were forced to 

walk through them inef ields bef orethe regular troops just to make sure there are no more 

amm unitions there.  And som e of them  lost their lives by doing that.
 
T hey were under (inaudible) because they had the regular Arm y gotf irst and whatever lef t 
over they had,that went to theforced labor cam p. 
 
Also, during thebrutal Russian winter, they
 
--
 
s o m e of  t h em
 
had regular clothes when they 
hadtom arch and they had tom arch a lot. T hose who were weak, they just followed the line.  And 

they either left them  there or they shotthem  so they don'thave to suffer any longer.
 
T hey were treatedby the Hungarian off icersver y brutally also.  They were slave laborers. 
T hat's what I cantell.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your last postcard is December
 
1942. W hen did your mother learnabout 
your f ather's death?
 
>> Péter Gorog: W ell, she did not learn
 
--
 
wel l, she was notif iedby the Hungarian 
governm ent with anofficial form  which cam e later on inher lif e thatwas an off icial notif ication that 

m y f atherdisappeared during the wartim e activities in Ukraine sometim e in February
 
1943. 
 
My m om  got the last postcardf rom the cam pf rom a mutualf riend who notif ied
 
--
 
or told her 
thathehasn't heardf rom  m y father andm any of  thef riends who were in the sam e battalion since 

February.  And this card was dated inApril.  So the most likely tim eof his disappearance,his death, 

is February
 
1943.
 
From  the diaries Ihave, I got the sense that she didn'tbelieve this news.  She hopedand 
hoped that maybe m yfather survi ved andhewas taken by the Russians asprisonerof  war and sent 

to Siberia which wasn't a pleasant place to be.  Nevertheless,
 
m y m om  hoped he would return.
 
Unfortunately hedidn't, just like the40,000 otherf orced laborers of the 100,000 that were 
taken to Ukraine during the war.  So40%of  them never returned.  Som e of them  really wer e taken 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

as prisoners of  war, and they were released af ter the war in 1946,1947.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Péter,so with the loss of  your father, your mother would continue to carefor 
you anddoall she could to protect you until
 
--
 
andthese conditions as awf ul as they were, things 
turned dram atically, prof oundly worse in March
 
1944 whenthe Nazis occupied Hungary.
 
T ell us what changed so dram atically and what thatm eantfor you and your mother.
 
>> Péter Gorog: The situationf or Jews were increasing even bef oreMarch
 
1944 when the 
Germ an troopsm arched into Hungary and actually occupied Hungary.  Restrictions becam e stricter 
and stricter. T hey hadto f orfeit their valuables. T here was an order that Jewish fam ilieshad to give 

their jewelr y over to the banks. They got a receipt thatthe bank took it f or, quote
-
unquote, 
saf ekeeping. Butthat was just thepreparationf or taking them away for good.
 
Food was in short supply for everybody.  It was rationed, but rationing was even worse for the 
Jews who by that tim ewere under curfew, not just during thenight but during theday. T hey were 

allowed to leave their hom esf ora coupleof  hours aday to do their off icialbusiness ordo som e kind 

of  shopping.
 
1944 March,the German troops came in.T he Hungarian government was still in charge.  
And theprim e m inister was m ore Germ anf riendly.  Num erus Clausus laws were enacted.One 

which affected us wasthat Jewish people had to leave their homes andm ove either tothe ghetto 

which was set up inm id 1944 in the traditional Jewish area of Budapest or certaindesigna
ted 

houses where Jews could live.  These houses were m arked with a yellow Star of David. The 

Hungarian game is Védett Ház m arked by astar, and that's wherem ost Jewish fam iliesm oved to.  

My m om , as I said earlier, she was a sm art cookie. She knew m ovi ng to these houses orto the 

ghetto wouldm ark herforever for the next step.  So she tried to go intohiding.  Shehad aver y close 

f riend,a Christianf riend, and she was a Christian,not just a non
-
Jew in ever y sense of  the word.  
And thisf am ily took us
 
inf or a coupleof  weeks until a neighbor reportedus to the police.
 
Andone day the Hungarian gendarmerie which is a strange organization.  It is somewhere 
between theArm y and thepoliceforce.T hey had a very distinctive unif orm . They had very 

d is t in
ctive hats with a cock feather on it or two cockf eathers. T heseare m yf irst realm em ories, not 
just what m y mother has told mefrom  thediaries or the postcards.
 
Onem orning there was a knock on the doorat the apartm ent where we stayed.  And twoof  
th e
 
gendarmeries came in and took m y m om away.  I rem ember that we were around the breakf ast 
table.  I was sitting ona chair with two big books on it because booster seats weren't available at that 

tim e. And thefam ilies didn'thave children, by the way.
 
An
yway, m y m om  wastaken away.  I really didn't know what it m eant. T hef amily obviously 
took care of me while m y m om  was away.  And they encouragedme thatm y m om  will com e back, 

she will com e back. And she did because ofher wit, because of her determinationto survi ve and 

m ake surethat I would survi ve.
 
She was taken to an infamous jail, inf am ousfor m any good reason in Budapest. T he 
so -
called (saying name) jail where people were collected,m ostly Jews, just bef orethey were taken 
to Auschwitz or the next concentration camp.
 
W henm y m om  got to the jail, she im mediately started protesting that they arrested her 
against the law, that she was protectedbecause she was a war widow.
 
My m om  wasn't a war wido w becauseonly people who were part of the regular Hu
ngarian 
Arm y and who died,their wives were declared war widows.  And there were certainprivile ges for war 

wido ws.  T hey got aportion
 
--
 
whenf ood was portioned, they got higher portions.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Higher rations.
 
>> P é te r Go ro g:  Ration s, so rry. 
 
And other privi leges.

My m om  wasn't a war wido w becausem yf ather was taken toaforced labor camp with the 
Arm y.  So theoff icial people Im entionedearlier which cam ef rom the Hungarian Ministry of  Def ense 
said that Árpád Grünwald disappearedblah,blah,blahhere and here and there was a bigstamp on 

it .
 
T he guards were uneducated.  Maybethey hadfour orf ive years of elementary school.  At 
m o st  
--
 
they couldn't even read what was onthepaper but they saw thebig stamp.  So they thought 
they did som ething wr ong by arresting m y mom . T hey went tothecomm and,and he calledm y mom  

in.  My m om told him  also that I'm  a war widow, you m ust letm e out.
 
He couldn't read thedocument, but he couldn'tf igure it out. Or whatever the reason was, 
m aybe just divine Providence, he lether out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So through her courageandjust her quick thinking,she is able to get outof  
there. And then
 
--
 
now she's got to do what to do.  You toldm e she then did another major act of 
chutzpahat that point.
 
>> P é t e r
 
Gorog:  Yes. She cam eback to theapartm ent where I stayed. And obviously we 
couldn't stay any longer because of all thosegood neighbors.  My mom didn't want totry her luck 

again.
 
So she called af riend of hers who ordered to live in the so
-
called pro
tected houses.
 
W hat happened in1944 on the verge of the U.S. governm ent andf inancial support of  Jewis h 
organization, a Swedish diplom at RaoulW allenberg went to Budapestf or the very purpose of  saving 

as many Jews as possible.  W hat he didandsom e other
 
m utual embassies in Budapest,they issued 
false passports.  Actually, they weren't false passports.T he passport was an original Swedish or 

Swiss passport, to Hungarians so they can prove thatthey areforeign citizens and they cannotbe 

arrested and per
secuted.
 
He alsoboughtup som e apartm entbuildings which according to international law was under 
theprotectionof  the Swedish governm ent and was treated asSwedish territory.  No Hungarian 

authorities could enterthese houses without the perm ission of the Swedish em bassy.
 
Andasm any buildings as he could buy up, these buildings were in the ghetto. This was, 
quote
-
unquote,fancy part of  Budapest where(inaudible) lived close to the Danube actually.  And 
people who moved to these houses were securef ora
 
while because no Hungarians, no Germ ans 
entered into these buildings and could arrest.  They couldnot take them away.
 
Som y m om  called this friendof  hers who had this docum ent, who already m oved into an 
apartm ent. And she told her thatthere was one threebedroom  apartm ent which was by H ungarian 

standards huge.  Andthere were two fam iliesliving only in the two bedrooms andthere was another 

oneunoccupied. Somy m om  tookm e, one suitcaseand thesepapers and the necessities and we 

m oved into oneof  t
hese W allenberg Houses.
 
Life there was

we l l ,  I wa s  3
 
1/2 years old. So if  you ask me whatI remember or whatmy 
m em ory is, I was an ignorant little boy, did what littleboys do. I didn't have the senseof  terror and 

horror what was going on outside the walls.  Andbecauseof the love of m y m om , that's the only 

thing I experienced. And that was enoughfor m e.
 
Life inthose protected houses was relativel y calm . Thehouses were surrounded by

there 
was a parliam entary military group party called the Hungarian Arrow Cross which in October
 
1944 
actually with a coupd'etat took over with theGerm ans andthese peoplebelonged to party and 

parliam entary group, were young people, 18to 20
 
years old. They were in black uniform or black 
shirts and blacktrousers.  And they were gua rding theseprotected houses whichm eant that they 

couldnotenter tothe house without perm ission. T hey didn'thave the permission. So we were saf e.

>> Bill Benson: T his was now probably October
 
1944?
 
>> Péter Gorog: That's correct.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And if  I m ight just interjectf or am om ent, you hadtold me earlier that initially 
the Hungarians andthe Nazis had pretty m uch deported allof  the Jews f rom  the countryside.  And 
now their attention was focusedon Budapest. Andthere had been an extraordinary num ber of  

deportations.  I think som ewherearound 450,000 Auschwit z in about six weeks.
 
T hen it stopped until the coup d'etat in October.  Now you hadbeen protectedup to that point.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Yeah, that's correct.  Historians andpolitical parties are explaining the 
history of  Hungary during the SecondW orldW ar andduring the Holocaust.  And it isa history that's 

unf ortunately m oreor less supported by the current governm ent, that the Hungarians werenot 

com placent in theextinction of the Hungary J ews.  T hef acts areunfortunately different. W henthe 

Germ ans cam e in to Budapest with 600 of the so
-
called com mando, I think that was the n
a m e,  
people couldn't deportin two m onths,400,000 Hungarian Jews f rom  the Hungarian countrys ide.
 
W hen you see the docum ents, when you visit  theW eb site of the Museum , you can see 
videos of  eyewitnesses and survi vors.  Hungarian Jews were arrested, were taken to ghettos setup 

in diff erent cities asaf irst stepof  taking them to Auschwitz and other concentration cam ps.
 
All of  thishappened wi th the helpof  theoff icial Hungarianpoliceforce and gendarmerie.  
T hey were the one who took the propertiesand valuables of thesepeople while they were deported.
 
As you said,they started at the countryside. 400,000 out of the 800,000 Hungarian Jews at 
that tim e in the m iddle of  the m onth ended up in Auschwit z
-
Birkenau and other places.
 
By Septem ber/October, they
 
turned to Jews of Budapest, the remaining Jews of  Budapest 
because,m ind you, already m any of  them died or were in thef orcedlabor cam ps.
 
Also, another sadf act of Hungarian history, whenthe Germ ansoccupied Poland, they asked 
fo r
 
--
 
I don't know exactly the Hungarian governm ent to deport15or18,000Polish Jews who lived in 
Hungary, m any of  them  who were born in Hungary but they never gained Hungarian citizenship.  So 

they were still Polish citizens.
 
T hose18,000 Polish Jews were f orced to leave Hungary.  T hey wer e transported to Ukraine 
where there was a cam p, infam ous cam p where 50,000out of the80,000Polish Hungarian Jews 

were practically butchered and killed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Péter,October
 
1944, youand your m om  are still in theW allenberg House 
protectedasm uchaspossible.  But all that changed very dram atically.
 
T ell us now what happened.  Becausef rom there you would beforced out, your mother would 
leave with you. T ell us what happenedand thenf rom  there you went into the ghetto.
 
>> P é t e r  
Gorog:  Yeah, this tim ethenew Hungarian governm entand the Arrow Cross, they 
couldn't careabout international law anym ore.  Andthey started togo into eventheprotected 

houses.  And Jewish people, Jewish fam ilies were sent away.  As Isaid, these houses were very 

close to the Danube. Most of them  were marcheddown tothebank of  the Danube. They were lined 

up
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T aken out of  theW allenbergHouses?
 
>> Péter Gorog: They were f orced out of theW allenberg Houses. They were taken to the
 
bankof  the Danube where they were shot. They fell in the river.  T hey didn't have to careabout 

even the deadbodies. Those whofell on theshore, they were thrown into the river.  And they 

system atically went through the houses and em ptied theapartm e
nts one by one.
 
Oneday there was a knock on our door.  And this Nazi
 
--
 
Hungarian Nazi, thugs, came inand 
toldm y m om  to get out and line up inf ront of the building.
 
Oneof  these young guys intervened, and he told to his com rades orcolleagues that" lea

them  alone, I know them . She's the mom of  little Péter."  He knew me by name. How did he know 
m eby name? Because we had nothing better to do while we were in thosehouses. W e were 

playing in the inner courtyard of  thisapartm ent building.  And what
 
the littleboys played, we played 
the English translation would be police and robbers or something like that. Wemade weaponsout of  

broom sticks and other junk.
 
And we just shoot other boom ,boom ,puff, puff.  Andthese thugs were sitting there in the 
do
orway of  thehouse. He saw us
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:They're watching to make sure you don't leave, they're watching you do this.
 
>> Péter Gorog: That's correct.
 
One gotthis crazy idea that why don't you give them ourown weapons and they can play with 
real weapons.
 
Being 4
 
1/2 years old,we were excited abouthaving
 
--
 
(laughter)
 
--
 
a  real weapon.  
Fortunately will, they were humaneenough and they tookout the am munition. So we just aim ed real 

weapons at each other and went boom, boom.
 
So we kind of got acquainted with eachother.  Som eof  them  probably had little brothers at 
home andthey lookedat usas will their little brothers, except we had the yellow stars on our coat.  

Anyway
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Spare this onefam ily, this mom  and son.
 
>> Péter Gorog: That's correct. This is because we built what youcall a relationshipthe 
previous few days or few weeks.  This relationship really saved our lifef or anotherday because we 

didn't know who would  come the next day.
 
So on thatday, we lef tthe protectedhousesand we m oved intotheBudapest ghetto which by 
thattim e was built up aroundthe great synagogue of Budapest,beautif ul big building, completely 

restored by now.
 
T hat was a traditional Jewish quarter of Budapest. According to Jewish custom s,onS
aturday 
you walk into the synagogue.  Sothere were synagogues in walking distancefor everybody.
 
T he ghetto was walled by that tim e. You could go
 
--
 
or those who were perm itted, could leave 
with perm ission. That's where we li ved.
 
B y th a t tim e ,th at wa s 
October, Novem ber, Decemberof  1944.  Budapest was surroundedby 
the Russian troops. They cam ef rom  the east. T hey were chasing the Germ ans all the way back to 

Germ any.  By thattim e, they reachedBudapest.  Budapest was under attack.  Air raids wer e dai
l y 
occurrences.
 
W e ha ve  t o
 
--
 
we had to go down to the basem ent of the apartm entbuildings. T he way the 
apartm ent buildings were builtat that time was an unf inished basem ent with dirtf loors. And there 

were wooden stairsf or every apartm ent where people
 
stored afew of  their wood they usedf or the 
furnaces in theapartment.
 
T hat's where we stayed most of the tim eduring this time. Even when the siren called theair 
raid off , there was no reason to go upstairs again because we just couldn't
 
--
 
didn't know when we 
have to come back.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you toldm e that the shelling and bombing was just relentless. So you 
were down in these basem ents with woodenfloors
 
--
 
I mean, dirtf loors, the conditions wer e horrif ic.
 
>> Péter Gorog: The conditions were horrif ic.  I rem em berthat we had a blanketon thef loor.  
T hat's where we sat and played. W eate if we hadfood.  At that time,f ood was very scarc e. W ater 

was not therem ostof  the days.  And we lived  practically undergroundf or 2
 
1/2 m onths.
 
W h il e
 
we heard this bom bing, again,f orm e, Ididn't know what it m eant. I didn't know thatthe 
house next to us werebombed andeverybody died, even who were under the building. By luck, by

divine Providence, we were saved.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter being four m onths in those conditions, you were liberatedby the 
Russians. Tell us what liberation meant.
 
>> Péter Gorog: W ell, liberationm eant that we could take the yellow Star of Davidf rom our 
coats. Itm eant that there was no daytim e curf ew.  Itm eant that we couldm ove back to our 
apartm ent.
 
I don't know if  Im entioned, when we were f orced to leave our apartm ent where my parents 
live f rom 1936 to 1944, a Germ anf am ily m oved inand took over the apartment.  It was ourluck that 

they preserved practically ever ything, thef urniture. I grew up with the sam ef urniturem y parents 

boughtaf ter they gotm arried. Notm any Jewish people were that lucky because unfortunately 

Jewish properties were looted as soon astheir fam iliesm ovedout, as soon as they had togi ve
 
up 
their shops andbusinesses.
 
So getting back to norm al was a different norm al, what you would call normal today.  But it 
was som ething which r esembled anormal life.
 
W emovedback to our apartm ent. Thisf am ily on their own willin gl y m oved out so we had
 
a 
place to live.  Food was still in short supply. Stores were em pty.  Otherfood was rationed. But you 

couldn't even use your rationing teacup because there was nof ood.  So what happened was that 

people in the cities carried their valuables, jewelr y, clothes, whatever they could barter and took the 

train tothe nearby vil lages or some villages were not nearby. but their belonging forf ood,eggs, 

bread.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your mom didthat?
 
>> Péter Gorog:  My mom  did. Becausethere was no nanny, she 
took m e and I rem em ber 
going to the railwa y station where the trains were so jamm ed thatpeople were traveling onthe topof  

the train justto getoutof the city and get somef ood.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And, Péter, when you were in the ghetto, you werein there with several other 
relatives.  I think several grandparents.T ell us what happenedto them .
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Yes,we m oved intom y grandparents'apartm entwhich was a one
-
bedroom 
apartm ent which meant one bedroom , onef am ily room , anda kitchen. And we
 
were there with two 
of m y aunts,m y m aternal grandparents,m y m other andI andm y cousin. That's where we lived.  

W esurvi ved.  My grandparents survived.  They were not victim s of the Holocaust in the sense they 

were not killed during the tim eof  Holocaust. But becauseof  starvation, becauseof  the lack of  

m edicalf acilitiesand opportunity.  They dieda couple ofm onthsaf ter the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you attribute that totally to how awf ul the circum stances,they just 
couldn't survi ve af ter the war
.  
>> Péter Gorog:  Yeah, they were so weak, so malnourishedthat I think they hada common 
cold or som ething like that which causedthem...
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did any otherf am ily m embers survi ve, Péter?
 
>> Péter Gorog: As I said, oneof m y unclesandm y aunts lef t Hungar y.  My aunt lef t in 1938.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before the war.
 
>> Péter Gorog: Before the war.
 
My Uncle Lester, he stayed in Hungary until 1941 wherehe was taken to aforced labor cam p.  
He was on leave andhe never went back.
 
He was lucky enough to have entry to the United
 
States because hewas born what was then 
part of the Hungarian em pirebutby the tim eof the war, it was part of Czechoslovakia.  Sohe was 

on the Czech quota system  which was relatively short.  He was able to get anentry V
is a .
 
He lef t Hungary, hef ollowed through the Nazi
-
occupied Europeandhe boarded the last ship

which lef tLisbon to the United
 
States.
 
>> Bill Benson: T o the U.S.  And we won't be ableto get into it, buthe and your aunt becam e 
im portant to you when you
 
cam e tothe United
 
States in 1980, if  I rem em ber correctly.
 
>> Péter Gorog: That's correct.  In 1980, I cam e with the excuse tovisit them . I visited them , 
andI never returned to Hungary.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You decided to just stay.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  I decided todefectf rom  Hungar y and stay in the United
 
States. And they 
were instrum ental in the f irst f ew m onths providing food and shelter and helping m e to get used to 
Am erican lif e. As long as they li ved, we stayed in close contact.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Let
 
me ask you just a couple more questions, Péter, before we closeour 
program  in just afew m inutes.
 
From  the littlebit you've beenableto share with us,obviously you just touched the surface.  
But it's clear that your m other was brave.  She was sm art. She was resilient. She was resourcef ul.  

But that continued
 
--
 
that didn't end with the war ending.  She continuedtodo what she could to try 
to get you andher outof the circum stances youfound yourselves in in Hungary.  But shewas not 

able to at that
 
tim e getyou outof  the country.
 
T ell us a little bitaboutthat.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  Yeah in 1946, she decidedwe should leave Hungary.  T here was nofuture 
for us. Her siblings lived inthe United
 
States.  She appliedf or a vis a, entry visa.  She gother 
Hungarian passport.  You saw the pictures atthebeginningf rom  that passport.
 
And while we were wai ting for the Visa, the Hungarian governm entandthe political system  
were taken over by the Comm unists with thehelpof  theoccupying Russianforces.  Hunga
rian 

borders were closed. Nobody in, nobody out.  And so we were wil l stuck there.  My m om was hired 

as a seam stressfor the rest of her working lif e. W orked in two shif ts.  I hardly saw her m ost of  the 

tim e. But we always h ad food on the table. Ialwa ys had clothes. And I'm  very gratef ul.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,Péter, the last question for you today is:  Youwere planning to goback 
to Hungary because you'd really like to learnwhat you can about where your f ather was.  Just say a 

little bit about that
. 
>> Péter Gorog:  Really unfortunately I havenom em ory onm y father's side. Theonly thing I 
can do at thispoint to translatethe cardsandtry to stitch together his lif e, the last two years of  his 

lif e isf rom the postcards and getdocum entsf rom official Hungarian archives which would at least 

gi ve m e som e kindof history of his lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because today you really learned nothing m ore than you knew then about his 
circu m st an ce s? 
>> Péter Gorog: W ell, obviously I learneda lotf rom m y mom who shared a lotand 
fortunately about two years beforem y m om died, I dida video intervi ew with her just about the 

Holocaust andf am ily history.  And thatone isstill waitin g f or transcript and translationfor the rest of 

m y f am ily.  That'show it happe
ned.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to turn back toPéter in just amomentto close our program .  Andas 
I said, we only got a glim pse.  Of course, what we are not hearing about is what Péter wentthrough 

in the subsequent years,f or the Hungarian revolt in 1956, the Prague spring in 1968 and his 

decisionto def ect.  You justheard a little bitabout his career. Buthe'sm ade theseam azing 

contributions to our nation since then.
 
So, Péter, thank youfor being here.  I wanttothank all of youf or being our audience today.  I 
want to rem ind you we will have a " First Person" program eachW ednesday and Thursday until the 

m iddle of August. Ihope you will be ableto returnat some point and join us.

It is ourtradition at " First Person"  that our" First Person"  getsthe last word.  And before I turn 
to Péterfor the last word, I'd liketodoa couple of  things.  One is when Péter's done, Joel,our 
photographer, is goingto com euponthe stage.  You saw those gorgeousphotographs atthe 

beginning.  He's goingto com euphere and take a picture of Péterwith you as thebackdrop. Soat 

thatpoint, I'm  going to ask you to stand so we can geta picture of Péter.
 
And then Péter will stay on the stage. W edidn't have tim efor you to ask him any questions.  
So if  you'd like to come up here on to the stage af ter we're doneand askhim  some questions or say 

hi or get your picture taken,please do that. Absolutely f eelf reetodo that.
 
So on thatnote, I'll turn back toPéter.
 
>> Péter Gorog:  I wanted to close with a picture projected.  Unfortunately becauseof  
technical diff iculties, I couldn't.  So you have to use your im agination.  And also you can this over, 

you can Google Hungarian Jews arri ving to Auschwitz.  In thepicture, you would see Jewish people 

just em barking f
rom  the cattle cars. They were taken to Auschwit z af terfour orf ive days' trip.  60, 80 
people ina cattle car lining up on theplatform and waiting f or som ething.  They didn't know what 

they were waiting f or.
 
You can see the grim expression of m ostly wom en andm any children.  During theSecond 
W orld W ar, about will 1.5
 
m illion children died.  Out of this1.5
 
m illion were Jewish children.  You can 
see the Jewish children on thispicture with the yellow stars com pletely oblivious what would happen 

in the n
e xt  24 ,  48
 
hours.
 
W hat happened was that they were gassed. T hey were crem ated. And they arenot with us 
anym ore.
 
I wrote to them  and I wrote to them em ory of m y f atherand them any Je ws who perished 
during the Holocaust that this would never happen again.  It is m y responsibility to tell m ystory and 

the story of the Holocaust. And it is everybody's stor y in this auditorium  and outsidethis auditorium 

tom ake sure that this one will never happenagain.
 
T he Museum has a local m antra:  Never again. W hat you do matters.  And the" you"  is inbig 
bold letters you can see outside the building.
 
W hat you do, what Ido, what we all dom atters, that the Holocaust will never happen again, 
not to the Jewish people, not to the people inSudan or Cambodia or Kosovo.  
Because unfortunately 
(saying nam e) didnot learnf rom  the Holocaust and the Holocaust since then.  And it'sour 

responsibility tom akesure that it will never happen again.
