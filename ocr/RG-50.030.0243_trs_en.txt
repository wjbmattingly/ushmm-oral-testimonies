Q: Would you please tell me your name?  

 

A: HermanWa jcma n. 

 

Q: And can you tell me  when you were born?  

 

A: January the 10th, 1925. 

 

Q: And where was that?  

 

A: Kielce, a city in Poland. 

 

Q: What part of Poland was it?  

 

A: Middle of Poland. 

 

Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your family, your parents, your siblings? 

 

A: My...I had one sister, a younger sister.  My 
father's family came from ______, a town near 
Krakow.  They were quite, you know, as you know Poland was a very...a few upper and the 

ma jority were kind of struggling for life through the hard life.  My family worked.  My 

grandfather especially was a self-made ma n.  ______ was very prosperous in different type 

of business, but he was a self-made ma n.  On my side, from my mother's side, they were a lot 

wealthier, but old money, like in the olden days, you know...old money comi ng from from 

the for generations, but my father's side was more strict.  My family, as a child anyway, 

were...I always identified with my father's family because they they were more 

accomplished.  They were more _____.  That...in that time already I realized what it means, 

you know, upbringing...children.  They were...even they had more money and everything but 

it was stricter that my mother's family was...we had grandmother, great-grandmother.  My 

great-great-grandfather was the first Jew in Kielce which he got the permission from the 

Czar of Russia to live in Kielce.  Jew were not allowed to live because it was a big city, and 

the grandchildren that they had so much money, they were a little bit spoiled and just like in 

America, they were not up to par.  I see it now.  I didn't see it then, but they...the the money 

spoiled them and it was too much money.  
 

Q: Can you tell me  about what your father did and... 

 

A: My father...my father and mother, they were th
e oldest from both sides and they were I think 
the unique, the unique couple.  They...in Poland they used to give dowries, you know, but the 

the the girl had to have a dowry in order to marry.  In my father's case, my grandmother 

was...she had a provision...at that time she was giving twenty thousand dollars.  That was a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
2 
 
lot of money...1920...for to my mother, but my father gave the same  amount.  My 
grandfather gave the same  amount and this was very unique, and sure enough, after two 

years they lost all the money because they gave it to an uncle, to the bank, and the bank 

failed, so they lost everything and...but my father started later a trucking business.  He was 

very successful and I remember till 1939 we were in the trucking business.  He had trucks all 

over Poland. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  about the the kind of schools you went to when you were growing up?  

 

A: I was going to my...I...my grandparents and comi ng from my mother's side, very old _____, 
very famous rabbis which...going back which were known from the from all old kind, very 

famous.  I mean not...I don't know if I can explain to you...it's not rabbis like we say here.   

It's something like ____ rabbis.  You heard probably about that...that type, so naturally the 

family was very orthodox but as the generation go down, it was a little bit less, you know, 

and I went to ________.  My mother was was so...my mother went to college.  In that time 

for her grandfather to go to to college...this I remember that two days before she graduates 

since she supposed to encourage to go _____ for girl from my family, it was...it was a 

revolution, that my grandfather found out that
 she was dancing at a dance...you know, before 
graduation, with the boys, and she never graduate. 
 It was forbidden.  Alright.  So that's how 
the type of ________.  I went through school, but my my mother was very progressive and 

she wants...she took me  out of school to send me  to a private school...from the from a 

religious school to a private school but they taught religion too, and then they want to send 

me  because I showed some  accounting, they want to send me  to Krakow to be...to a higher 

school of accounting and the war broke out. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  what happened then?  

 

A: When the war broke out, the first day in 1939...as soon as the war broke out, the second day 
we had trucks that my father took the family, us and my uncle and another twenty 

people...whoever wanted to go...and we run away from Kielce to the Russian border to get 

away and I remember that my grandmother...t
his I saw with my own eyes...took out, at that 
time she had twenty thousand ______.  It was a lot of money because it was...people never 

saw that type of money.  She gave it to him, said whatever it will help him, keep it then.  We 

went on the way to...we went on the way to th
e Russian border.  It was about five, six 
hundred miles.  On the way the German tanks were even ___.  Killed two wome n on our 

truck.  A truck...it was on the truck and in Europe at that time we had a General Motors 

truck, but the trucks were not covered.  It was only a cover from canvas.  You know, they 

didn't make trucks with the all all covered, so a few people were killed from the...from the 

Germans and we went to the city of Rovno and we heard that the Germans are comi ng.  We  

wanted to go away to to Russia, and finally we went a few miles.  The Russian army, they 

had a pact...the Russian army came in and we went back to Tuchin to a town of Tuchin that 

was about thirty kilome ters from Rovno.  People were very nice.  They gave us a place 

where to stay and we lived there and the Germans...the Germans were, you know, they 

divided Poland between themself but after a while my mother went back because we didn't

have...when we run away so fast we di
dn't no clothing, no nothing.  We ...when you live 
everyday...she went back and that time when other people went back to Poland to to come 
back but she never got to and she couldn't ____ because they closed the borders, the 

Russians did.  So we stayed in Tuchin ma ybe a year. 
 

Q: Let me just...let me just ask one thing, so
 could you  explain again what what did your 
mother do?  
 

A: My mother was a housewife, which was helping the business at the bookkeeping but she 
was... 
 

Q: No, no.  When she got to... 

 

A: To...to...to...to Kielce.  She went back to Kielce. 
 She stayed there, her home, because we left 
the business, that we left everything, that she wanted to liquidate, to bring things and come 

back to us, but she never...I never saw her after that.  There was a lot of people used to go 

through the...through the border because it was right in the beginning in '39 and we really 

didn't know what the Germans are, that you can go but you can't  come  back.  Nobody really I 

can see knew what to expect.  They knew it's going to be a hardship, but nobody expected 

trouble.  They'r e going to beat up a few things but there was no question, even for the 

Germans, because I pondered a lot of times and I ask questions why, because I'll tell you, 

explain later the reason which I could till today I don't understand because we went back to 

Lemberg (ph), OK, after a year.  Am I so far OK?   My mother went back and we stayed in in 

Tuchin. 
 

Q: Andthen... 

 

A: Then Tuchin was too small for my father.  We  couldn't...we had to ma ke a living so we went 
to Lemberg.  It was a big town.  It was in that time about twenty thousand refugees came 

from all over.  Lemberg was the biggest town.  You heard about Lemberg...Lvov (ph).  But 

the living conditions and their hatred...not hatred but their disliking of the Russians with their 

lies, with their with their anti-religion, with their anti-...anti-behavior not against Jews but 

against everybody was so great that people registered.  They were staying in line for three, 

four days, and they wanted to go back home, and I reme mber...I was at that time twelve, 

fourteen years old, and I reme mber that Ge
rman officer, high officer came out because 
people were standing in the German Embassy because Russia in...had a pact at that time and 

I was there because we had to register to go back, especially...our mother was there.  We 

want to go back to Kielce.  And he said in German, Juden (ph), we don't want you.  We  don't 

like you.  We  hate you.  Why do you want to go back?   But I assume  the dislike and the 

disappointme nt because who escaped...most wealthier people from from the people who had 

the means or like I say trucks and that and people were were anti-Communists.  They they 

they were not officially anti-Communists like we know later, but they just didn't like the 

system.  In Lemberg we had it very good, and I like to point out this, to tell this story...it has 

nothing to do with the Holocaust but it has to do with the Holocaust.  My cousin...we were 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243

very extensive.  We  had over three hundred people in Poland, the family, very known 
from...the ma jority were well-off.  It was 
so well-off that nobody came to America because 
we said we don't, we don't need it and we had it...they had a good life in Europe.  Usually 

when people didn't a life, they couldn't ma ke a living there, they went to America.  That was 

the trend in Europe at that time.  I had a cousin which was a son from a very wealthy family. 

 They had a textile business, and he was the black sheep and he was the chief of the 

Communist Party and...not the chief of the Communist Party as such but the chief of Poland 

for the help NORP (ph) it was called, N - O - R - P, help for the prisoners of capitalists.  

Alright.  He was an idealist and it just...it so happened...I don't know if this is something 

relevant to the case but attests a moral story to it which I would like to say.  And he was put 

up the Red flag in the Polish parliame nt.  That's how devoted he was, but he was an 

intellectual and he got ten years in there, ____ a real prison, Poland.  When he was in Kielce 

and I was nine years old, nobody was in our house in Kielce and I reme mber he came...they 

let him out because they were helping him in prison.  They let him out, and they said that he 

came in and four fellows carrying the books after him, you know.  He had so ma ny books 

from prison because he came...they let him outunexpectedly and he was grateful because his 

brothers came over to us to bring food to the prisoner.  The prison was a dungeon.  People 

were dying there from the wetness, you know, from...there were underground wetness and 

they they put them in there not to live.  He was there ten years but being that they were rich, 

they bribed the authorities.  They went out sooner.  And this cousin came to to Lemberg and 

he became the director of the biggest textile store and at that time it was...you see in Russia 

you couldn't...if you worked, you could work a 
whole month and not earn for bread.  You 
were hungry, but if you had a ______, _____ _____, you could live two months.  Do you 

understand?   And he was the director of the bi
ggest biggest...is this...is this relevant or not?  
 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: I'll tell you why it was relevant.  You will find out if I...he he was so dedicated but he was so 
disappointed.  While he was there, with the Russian system, with the Communists, while he 

was sitting that he went out of his way...he 
took us in, you know, it was a line...people stay 
there three days...he took us in because me and my father, without the line, without waiting, 

two times a day.  That's how we lived.  We  got ten yards of material.  We  sold it, but this was 

against his whole principle.  He went to jail for that.  He would have never done before the 

war because he was through and through and dedicated.  Why was he disappointed?   

Communism is ____.  Because all his friends what were sitting in jail, the rations put to 

______.  They told him...this is not hearsay but I heard it when I walked with my father and I 

have a good memory and I heard it when he was telling my father this, that they told them 

that we don't need Communism from Poland.  If you're a good Communist, you should have 

stayed there and fight the Fascists.  See Communists at that time didn't want, they didn't 

_______ because they were too smart, too wised up.  We stern Communists are no good, see. 

 In in Poland, in Russia... 
 

Q: Why...why don't we go back here...yeah, go back here to your story about your your being in 
Lvov.

A: Yes...but I I was...he returned to Po...to Germany to...he was so...that's what I wanted to say.  
He returned and the Germans killed him in a month, a horrible way.  That's was one thing 

what I wanted to...in me mory to him because he helped us in death.  That's was...he hated so 

much ____ that he returned to to...then the Germans hunt him right away and they killed him 

in a most horrible way and that finishes the stor
y.  OK.  We  were in Lvow.  We  registered.  
The Russians came, one day in 1941...sometimes I can...you understand the _____...and they 

took all the Jews what registered to go back.  They had a list and they took them to Siberia 

because they they were disappointed.  How can people go back to Germany when we are 

living in paradise already?   My father and my
 sister and I, we had a friend was worked uh a 
district attorney and he was a Party man and we were in his house hiding and they came in to 

look for us.  They asked him, are you...do you have any foreigners here?   He said no.  And 

he was hiding...he showed his card and they le
t...they didn't look.  In a way that mi nute it 
was lucky but it wasn't  because otherwise ma ybe they would survived.  Of course you never 

know what's happening.  It was a time that you 
never knew what is right and what is wrong, 
what you're doing is good, what you're doing is bad, so we left, but whoever was...after when 

they took away all those people in tra...in in 
in trains without food, without that...they took 
them to Siberia.  Whoever was left and he was a foreigner, they gave him a passport.  They 

couldn't live hundred miles from the border, so we moved back to Tuchin.  That's how we 

stayed back to Tuchin.  We  lived in Tuchin till 1942.  That's why...then the Germans came 

in, naturally in 1941 and my father didn't...in Tuchin was a factory.  Should I go now to 

Tuchin?   In Tuchin was a factory which by our standards was very small, but in 1942 the 

Germans were freezing already near Stalingrad 
that time.  Their clothes...they didn't have 
prepared themselves and we were ma king...in that factory they were ma king wool.  You 

know, they have the sheep.  They took...then they were ma king heavy ma terial, so the 

Germans grabbed those things and that factory 
was a was two engineers.  One was Gros (ph) 
and they were _____, from Lodz, which they were textile engineers and they were running 

that factory.  The Germans came and they made a big deal out of it to enlarge the factory.  

My father became friends with Gros.  He didn't...he was religious.  He didn't work on 

Saturdays... 
 

Q: Yourfather?  

 

A: My father...so he talked to Gros and he said, you know, why don't you became overseer in 
the factory.  The factory had also rooms and we moved in where the factory there has three 

rooms.  You will be there the janitor and the overseer, everything.  I mean...I don't mean the 

janitor but overseer.  You will live there in the factory.  So I...we got connected to the factory 

and we...and we heard what was going on already. 
 That time  already we knew the tragedy 
what's happening because they start...in 1942 they starting already to killing Jews all over 

around, except in our town because that was...was three thousand in the small town Tuchin.  

Three thousand people.  And me  being young and 
there, I was kind of engrossed day in, day 
out, and one day...that was in 1941, Gros went with the car because we had always business 

in Rovno.  Rovno was about thirty-five kilome ters, a mile...I don't know exactly.  I was in 

the car with him...

Q: Excuse me .  Did you work with Gros or...?  

 

A:  I worked, yeah, and I did certain things, but I was young, you know, so I... 

 

 

Q: Like like a go-for (ph)?  

 

A: Yeah.  Right.  The...I was with him every day because it was small and I...he talked to me 
and in there it was Gros and there was another engineer which he wasn't  that active.  Gros 

was a great personality.  He...he was dynami c.  He was  ___ and he was uncorruptible which 

was very rare.  He didn't want to  get rich, because at other times we had in different places 

that whoever was on the ruler, you know, they tried to...he didn't care.  He was through and 

through a genuine to help, to help.  There was 
also a director, a secre...an accountant, the 
ma in accountant which was Jewish.  He he graduate from Berlin and the  German ma de him 

a false Deutch (ph), which the only time what I heard that the Germans made a Jew a 

German, because they needed him and he spoke beautiful German.  They were so impressed 

with him, they told him you are a German.  But through and through he...he stayed away 

from...he wasn't  that friendly.  It didn't cha nge but he was natural you know, and actually he 

was a false Deutsch (ph).  You know what a false Deutch is?  
 

Q: Why don't you explain that?  

 

A: A false Deutsch means that he was a German
 but he was not born in Germany but he was 
from the German nation.  All the Germans what lived out of Germany are considered false 

Deutsh.  That's what also the things that Hitler wanted to take all the land till Slovakia (ph) 

and that's wherever a German lived, he said they'r e false Deutsch.  They belong to Germany. 

 That's called a false...false is nation, a national German or in other words.  OK.  So we lived 

there.  The city...there was over three thousand people because other people came from all 

over, from Tuchin, and we were kind of privile
ged, the whole city, because of that factory.  
We got more food, that the ghetto was not built right away, but I remember in 1942...I don't 

reme mber the date...Gros said Herman, let's go.  We 'r e going to...to Rovno We  came to 

Rovno.  Before we came into the outskirts of Rovno, five German SS...I'm talking about 

____.  I think it was...more or less I recognized, you know, came over and they stopped the 

car.  It was a chauffeur, me , and Gros and some body else.  Are you Herr Gros?   He said yes. 

 You have behaved from ___ Fuhrer, from ____,  _____, you should go back to Tuchin.  

You can't  get in to the city.  He asked why, you know, because he felt with the Germans 

very, very open, very _____, because he knew the the top. So they said don't ask questions.  

Just go back.  We  got back and found out that that day they killed...I don't know exactly but 

to my knowledge twenty-two thousand Jews in in Rovno.  That was the date and they 

wanted to save him, so they they turn us back.  After that about a few weeks later, so we 

knew we were...the depression was going in already.  We  knew that...you see, it came 

gradually and like I mentioned before to the lady that in the places where the Russians were, 

this we knew and this I heard also from the Germans through Gros that there was not like in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243

Poland. In Poland where the where the Germans were from the beginning, they put people to 
concentration camps, to arbeits lagers (ph) but where the Russians were, they abused older 

Jews, all the Jews were ninety percent under Communist, they are Jews of the old 

Communists, and they they very rarely took them to camps or to work, but they were ma ss 

murdered.  They not...not even crematoriums, but they killed them...the open graves.  They 

took Ukrainians and the Ukrainians did the killings.  We  came  back and about a few weeks 

later I was in the office in the factory and they said there's some high Germans comi ng in to 

inspect the factory.  We ll, I was there because, you know, I was young so I could get in any 

place and I was sitting in a side and he came in and he introduced himself.  It was...Gros was 

there, the other engineer and that false Deutsh, their accountant, and I was there...nobody 

else.  And came in and said  Reichsmi nister 
(ph) Rosenberg (ph), Alfred Rosenberg.  I knew 
who Alfred Rosenberg was.  Everybody knew.  I knew him actually from the Nuremburg 

laws because he was the one what started the whole trouble.  I didn't know...there was 

another guy.  Alfred Rosenberg was slim.  I remember him just like now, and the other 

fellow was Erich Koch.  Erich Koch was the ______ from Prussia.  I don't know if you know 

what the _____ is.  The ________ was the government and Erich Rosenberg said that I just 

got a promotion from the Fuhrer that I am now th
e mi nister (ph) of all the territories what we 
took and at that time Germans was the height.  They were up to Moscow and to Leningrad.  

It was 1942.  I'm the _____ of all the territories what we took from the from the Russians.  

Actually _____, _______, east, OK.  So he was the the ma in ma n, and they were talking 

what they can produce and how _____.  Very, very cordial to to Gros and very... 
 

Q: And you were there in the room?  

 

A: I was there and sitting there, but I remembered what they did, what they do in _______.  It's 
very hard to explain but as I'm sitting now, and I was fifteen years old, I thought and I was 

wondering if I would have a grenade, I woul
d kill myself and I would kill Rosenberg and 

Gros and Koch and all of them in the  house, if I could have it.  This was just a childish way, 

but the bitterness what what I held from Rovno.  They killed twenty-two Jews and and from 

Lemberg.  You lived every day, but this was just, you know, some thing...a dream what a 

child can can dream, I would do that. It's even foolish to repeat but I'm repeating it what my 

thoughts were at that time, and while I was there, Gros said...this I remember...Herr 

Rosenberg, Herr Mini...Herr Mini... Herr Reichsmi nister...that's how they...I remember the 

word...Herr Reichsmi nister, __________.  We  are very productive Jews.  This was the 

question...are you a productive?   We thought at that time yet if you are a productive Jew, 

they'd let you live.  If you're not a productive, they they will kill you.  You see, the Germans, 

they were doing so systematically and I don't have to go into it because this was...a lot of 

people, everybody knows their system, you know, so I'm not going into it, but we 

thought...still thought that if we are so productive, if Rosenberg comes to a small town to us, 

we must be important, so he said, Herr Reichsmi nister, how's about to let us live.  So for our 

town...you know we'r e only three thousand Jews.  We 'r e productive.  We 'r e working for the 

Germans.  Let us live.  
 

Q: Let me  ask this.  Gros was Jewish?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
8 
 
 
A: All the way.  Yes.  Jewish and Jewish.  He
 had a Jewish girlfriend.  He was ma rried to a 
Jewish _______, and he never knew that he was going to be involved...he was a...the time 

put him in he was an engineer from from Lodz
, that time put him in to made...to be a leader, 
to do, but he was from ___ and ____, the ____, you know to a Jewish cause.  He was not just 

a Jewish but he worked for the Germans, but this is...he wanted to save and he he wanted to 

save himself too, but being that he was the the whole...the whole _____, you know, the the 

key from the factory and with the Germans it's if you went to the higher echelon you could 

talk to them.  It was just like uh  _____ said...whoever's a Jew, I I decide.  You understand.  

So when you talk to them, even if it was Rosenberg, the biggest murderer, or Koch, but if 

you were sitting with them, you talked like I'm talking with you.  But he also said, they said 

Herr Gros, and this was the true words what I heard, ___________.  I'm sorry to tell you...see 

he was...Germa ns were usually very polite, very nice.  They kill you but they'r e very nice 

and very civilized. And they said ______.  He didn't say you are Jew or death.  No.  ______, 

but I have a ____, I have an order from the...I'm I'm repeating in German because his 

words...I'm...in my in my mi nd...I have order from Fuhrer that the _________...that means 

that no Jews can be alive.  Then I started to think about...see before I didn't, but then I started 

to think, now I can come  to ___ and I had that grenade because I saw that there's no end.  

Once he said this and he was...he was the god.  He was...he was the life and death.  When 

they went, Gros, my father, the owner, said there's no solution for us.  We  have no time.  

And we started to dig a bunker in the factory at night, throwing out the ground and dirt and 

digging and putting away the ground nobody should know, and we did this and this was 

around August they opened the ghetto.  The first time in Tuchin, they put in all the Jews in 

the ghetto and also in the ghetto was a synagogue with warehouses and all the wheat, the 

corn what they took away from the peasants, they were storing there.  They were storing the 

wheat full tons of tons.  We told later if you will destroy that, the German army will starve, 

you know.  I'm talking about myself.  I said we as a as a young boy, you know.  We  actually 

moved into the ghetto but we had passes to go to the factory where we lived half-time in the 

ghetto.  The ghetto was an open ghetto.  You could come  in and out.  It wasn't  like ghettos 

that police was around surrounded.  Again, thr
ough the factory and through Gros and also 
the comma ndant knew that if Rosenberg come s in, he is good with Gros.  He was the nicest 

guy and tried to accommodate because they were...Germa ns were always scared about 

higher.  Gros ma y say some thing that we'r e not treated right, so even they were scared, so 

they treated us like with...the whole the whole Jewish and he promised them that nothing 

will happen to us.  He didn't hear...he didn't know.  The comma ndant from the city didn't 

know what Rosenberg, what I knew, when 
I was nobody but but we knew through Gros and 

we didn't tell nobody.  Gros said not to say a word not to put a panic.  The only people...I 

think what Gros did he went to the Jewish leadership there and told them that there's no 

solution, no way.  So we lived in the ghetto and it came August and my father was going, 

still stayed in the factory, you know, and didn't come  home and two days before Yom 

Kippur, September I think it was...I can't  remember the date...the Jewish community 

surrendered the Jews, came together.  They gave whoever was young they gave bottles of 

acid, you know, sulfuric acid.  There was a fewguns, a few deaths, which I didn't...I heard 

but I didn't see but a few young people had some , but they said if the Germans will come in,

let's not die because we knew in Rovno they took them to the grave and they shot one by 
one.  Let's kill as many Germans as we can.  Let's burn the city.   
 

Q: Had you or anyone uh seen these ma ss murders in Rovno or you just heard about them?  

 

A: People...if you saw them, you didn't hear about them.  You understand?   We  came...we came  
to...the closest I can say whoever worked with the mass murderers in Rovno was like me and 

Gros sitting there, two miles away fr om the mass murders, and he said they'r e killing Jews 

and then we saw the graves.  And then we saw there's no...see we went to Rovno later.  

There were graves but there was no Jews, so if you saw them, you didn't talk about them.  

You understand?   Because there was no way to escape.  Does this answer your question?   

You couldn't...you couldn't be there and escape because they were surrounded.  We  were 

talked about it and there were...you see, there was not only Germans.  The problem was the 

Ukrainians were worse than the Germans.  They ma de sure that nobody should escape.  You 

could escape from a a wagon, from a train, but you couldn't escape if they surrounded you 

and they and they have ma ss...mass that you couldn't escape.  There was no escape, not one 

to my knowledge.  But we saw the graves later.  I saw it where where they killed...it took 

place.  We  saw...this I saw before...the day be
fore Yom Kippur that the Ukrainians were 
building right...not far.  We  could look...start di
gging graves.  They didn't take any Jews to 
dig.  Normally they took Jews to dig graves, but we, the three thousand people, very strong, 

very healthy because we had a good life till then, through the factory and through Gros' 

influence, we'r e not starving.  Normally, the Germans starved that the people didn't have the 

strength to fight, to to resist.  They starved them out slowly, slowly that they lost their fight.  

We  were strong and healthy, not hungry, so
 when you have strength, you fight.  You 
understand?   You don't...you do whatever you could because you still have strength.  That  

was the only difference and we saw that they'r e building graves and the day before Yom 

Kippur I remember I went out and I and I opened...it was a beautiful day I remember and I 

said it's so gorgeous. It's so beautiful.  I'm fifteen years old and I have...and I have to die in 

this grave.  I kept...I...a day before Yom Kippur, my father came into the factory, to the 

ghetto.  This I reme mber...they asked him why do you come  back.  Why do you come  back?  

 So he said, I want to be with my children.  I...me and my...I and my sister were were in the 

ghetto and then that they surrounded.  You couldn't go out already.  Before we could.  Took 

away the passes, you know, the last day we couldn't get back, but in...they let in, so he didn't 

have to come  but he came back.  Naturally some  fathers, you know, a father is a father.  He 

wanted to come  back.  So we were talking, the the ____.  We  knew they'r e digging graves 

and we knew...we didn't know how they'r e going to come , how we have to fight them, how 

you have to use the bottles and whatever and right after Yom Kippur in the evening when I 

I...around four...become  dark, I fell asleep.  What the Germans wanted to do was send in 

trucks and grab a few hundred people at a time and to take them out and to shot them and 

come  back, slowly, gradually because they didn't want a fight because they didn't know...we 

were too too strong and too...they didn't have
 a division there, you know.  They had...but 
they had the police and what I remember is I fell asleep and I woke up and I saw fire, more 

fire yet.  You know, the ghetto in the small Polish towns were wooden...wooden houses.  

They were there. I woke up and I knew that it started.  I looked for my father and sister. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243

Couldn't find anybody.  It was already fire, 
burning, yelling, people were burning, and the 
the Germans used a wooden gate.  They didn't have to build a strong gate around the ghetto 
because there was...the ghetto was only short time that they had it from wood, so we had to 

run, to run away.  I kept the bottles and whoever was right there, the Germans were there.  

We start throwing, throwing.  Then the Germans start...this I saw, the Germans start burning 

the face.  You know, when you...ashes when you get in face, it's not so pleasant, you know, 

but we knew that we can't , so what they did, they regrouped, and they got in one side with 

the machine guns.  They saw that they can't  do it and and it was also the order the first thing 

to burn the synagogue, the corn and the wheat.  This was...if you have to die, let the food 

burn.  Let them not...let them starve, you know, and our mi nd this was the the whole 

salvation because if if you if you think you cat
ch...they say a razor blade, you know, even if 
you cut yourself.  This was so far what we were talking to burn the the...nothing we could 

do.  We  were...we were defenseless.  So I reme mber that I walked...while they were shooting 

from one side I walked to the other side.  I don't know if it's northeast...I I don't know...and I, 

with this arm yet I pushed...and the hundreds of people with me , we pushed the the gate.  

The gate fell down.  Then the gate fell down and we had to climb it.  We  started running.  

People started running, but when we start running, there was a Jewish cemetery.  Usually the 

ghetto was right and the Jewish cemetery was on on the hill.  The Germans, they were 

shooting but the bullets mostly hit the stone.  Whoever fell, fell.  Mostly they didn't do much 

but because they hit the stone.  You know, we were after that... 
 

Q: So the gravestones gave you cover?  

 

A: The gravestones gave us cover.  Otherwise nobody would have survived because they were 
standing there and we were on top.  The gravest
ones gave us cover and I knew when I...I can 
recall even now when I was running I knew every mi nute I would be hit from the back, but 

the stones...just you hear bouncing, you know, bouncing bullets.  It was...and here the whole 

city was already...was burning.  The whole ghetto
 was one, one big fire.  Whoever could run, 
run.  I was looking...my mother...while I was running...you see over there woods 

were...mostly wooded area.  We  were running to the woods.  It was about ten kilome ters, but 

I got in in in the place where we lived was a family Constant...from 

Constantinople...Constanople.  A father...his na
me  was Kagan (ph), and he had a daughter 
my age, a real pretty girl I reme mber, you know, and he said, while we were...they run away 

from their ghetto to us, so we knew each other and three other fellows what they knew 

Kagan.  I couldn't find my sister and and fath
er so I was with them, and we were running 
together, and we run into the woods.  To the woods, it was very...not woods, you know, 

ma ybe two, two miles and those part, two mile woods was nothing because there were five 

hundred mile woods later, further up, you know.  Big woods going into Russia.  Those are 

still wild country, you know, with woods.  In the morning...it was already in the morning 

because we started later.  We  woke there and then we saw that we were quite a big amount 

of people and we got Kagan...I was the youngest so with with the girl was Kagan and the all 

three but there were three brothers. Said this is not the place to stay.  The Germans will come 

tomorrow and they will kill us all because there's no place here.  I mean we'r e open here.  

The three brothers suggested they have about twenty miles away from there, thirty miles

a _____.  _____ is German. ______________.  In the woods where he used to own that land, 

there were woods going they said up to Kiev.  I didn't measure them but there were for 

hundreds of hundreds of miles woods, and each mile, each kilometer...I'm talking mile but it 

was kilometer...had a measure, a number, you know, not to get lose, and it had a little...for 

horses to go through because they cut...when they cut the wood, so they had...it was like a 

road, like a city from woods.  But also was cut out pieces where Ukrainian villages were 

there, so he said let's run away.  I...we are from that part and I know people what we gave 

away everything what we had, and they will help us.  They would hide us.  Let's go.  We  

went.  We went through a water that I remember.  It was already late.  Over there it's it's 

cold, and we came to that to that village.  I remember they gave us food.  We went into the 

people what they they were friends from that...t hey were from that village.  They were very 

nice to them.  They gave us...we were hungry.  Hunger doesn't  stop, no ma tter what, no 

ma tter how ___ you are, especially when you are young.  And I reme mber I fainted.  I 

fainted and I fell down and some how I woke up and I said why did I...to Kagan I said why 

did I wake up.  I didn't...so he said some body will cry. This is a time not to be sorry.  He 

wanted to give me ...to grow up, I should grow up, you know.  This is not a time to cry.  If 

you...if you didn't get up, you didn't get up.  We  stayed there for two days I think and we 

found out that they killed the three brothers.  The Ukrainians killed the three brothers.  They 

came up to us, without...without shame and they said we don't have nothing against you, to 

Kagan, to his sister, to me .  They gave us alot of things, everything what they had and we 

were scared that they would want it back, so we killed them.  Just plain ________.  And you 

can run.  You can go.  We  don't have nothing against you.  We  went away from there and we 

went to the woods, looking where going.  We  went to the woods and there was a small 

village and it was only one house.  Before the village was one house, outside, out ___.  

Again we were hungry.  When you have...when you are hungry, you don't care where you're 

going or the enemy because the hunger, starvation...the air is good.  The air was fresh.  When 

I...when I think about it now, why did we...you know, they were Ukrainians, enemy territory, 

just just like that, but there's no other place to go, and we knocked and there was...came out a 

young ma n.  The ma n was in pretty good _____, had a wife and a little baby.  Oh...stay with 

me .  We 'r e going...he gave us food, kept us.  We  stayed there three days or four days.  He 

was very nice to us.  Kagan, at that time he around forty years old.  You know, when you are 

fifty and forty, you're an old ma n.  He was w
earing a chain.  You know, in the olden days, 
you saw the double chain with a pair of boots.  Boots, new, nice boots.  When I run away 

because I slept, I put on shoes that...old shoes, you know, because I I got dressed quick 

because I saw the fire, but he probably didn't 
sleep.  He was already to ___ so he put on 
whatever he had the best.  I had here hidden 
diamonds what my father gave me  from my 
mother and from my grandmother, you know, diamonds and things, but nobody knew about 

it.  It was in a...you know, like you have in a sling, but he showed up there with a gold chain 

with the boots.  That was enough.  They took...the Germans was the love... salt was the very, 

very dear, very rare over there.  If you brought in a Jew, the Germans paid a half a pound, a 

pound or half a pound of salt for each Jew.  Plenty Jews were killed for that salt and if he had 

a gold watch with boots, was worth hundred pounds of salt.  I reme mber it was Saturday 

night, and Michov (ph), he liked me  and he said you know, you sleep.  They had, you know,

very primitive houses with the the straw covers you had which you don't even probably saw 
in your life, but outside were for the cow or for...you know, the straw and the...whatever they 

had some  land because it was woods so they didn't have too much land.  He said that Kagan 

and the daughter should sleep there.  It wasn't  that cold.  It was warm, and I should sleep 

inside.  I slept Saturday night and Sunday morning I woke up and I see Michov walked in a 

little drunk and he was wearing the chain and the boots.  ____ the dumbness, the stupidity...I 

don't know...fear I didn't have because there was nothing to fear.  I asked him, Michov, 

where you take the watch and the boots.  That's not yours.  That's Kagan's.  So he said I'll be 

honest with you.  I killed him.  He was an old ma n and didn't want to live, so I killed him.  

But you, I'm going to keep you for the whole winter here.  Don't be afraid.  You have 

nothing.  That was his words, and I reme mber them just like now, so I said...

look.  You understand?   I never looked, you know, but when you are depressed, when you 

are turned up, at that time you you looked strange, you knew that you are a Jew right away.  

You understand?   In a norma l society ma ybe they wouldn't...they wouldn't recognize because 

I didn't have...I didn't never looked typical.

the peasant...peasant German.  You understand?   And you look skin...slim so they were 

laughing and they liked me, so I said to them, look that he killed.  I I told them the story and 

I'm here alone and I would like to fight in the partisans.  So they said  sorry, but we don't 

take anybody.  The Germans have to come in here.  We are living the territory and the 

Germans supposed to come  here.  You better run away from here.  Run where?   And I...to

thought they have certain salvation, there's no end, there's no help for nobody.  You are 

alone.  You you feel like you're in a cage and you're fighting to get out but all the doors are 

locked.  But what they did, they gave me  a horse, see, because this was deep in the woods.  I

horse which they took from a peasant.  You know partisans took whatever they needed and 

they said take this horse and run away from here because the Germans have to come  here, 

the army, and your life is not ____.  I asked them what type of partisans are you, because 

there were two kinds of partisans.  So they said we are the elite, the ___________.  You 

know, we are sent from Moscow to organize.

and you don't even know that you saw us because they were scared that if the Germans 

catching me, they starting to ask questions, I would tell them that I saw partisans, where and 

what.  They didn't want.  They gave me  the horse and they left and I was here in the woods

with the horse.  I got in on the horse and I let it...I knew how to ride horses before so I...the 
horse took me  to the owner.  It was a few, few...quite a few mile away in the woods...took 

me  to the owner.  The horse, you know...and I didn't know at that time that horses have a 

sense that they take you where you come  from like like dogs.  I went to the owner.  It was a 

Ukrainian.  He was very nice to be.  He was happy he got the horse back.  He gave me  food 

and he said but don't stay here.  Go further in the woods there and there.  He said I heard that 

far away, you know, about ten, twenty miles, there's some  Jews hiding.  That's what he told 

me .  I don't know where, but some  Jews hiding in the woods.  This I won't be alone.  I went

miles, ten...ten kilometers were villages cut out in the woods, what they have corn, 

land...they they'r e living...living three hundred, four hundred people, Ukrainians.  I went in

some body said, in Polish, ________.  Jew is here. That he was a policeman before the war 

and he was the only Polish  fa mily what lived in this village.  He was scared to death to be 

there because they hated him, but it was...he didn't know yet where to go and what to do.  He 

stayed there and he told me that I must be born under a lucky star that I came to him because 

if I would walk into any other house, I would be dead immediately.  This is the headquarters 

from Bulbas (ph). There were two partisan
 organizations, one ________ and Bulba.  Should

Q: _________?  

 

A: OK.  Bulba was Teras Bulba (ph) of _____________.  ____ was Ukrainian...Ukrainian

because the Jews didn't kill him, Bulba, but they were both working with the Germans.  They 

thought that the Germans will give them independence.  They were anti-Communists under 

Russia, not under...the Communists went under 
Russia but they were killing Polish people 
and Jewish people and helping the Germans.  And this was the headquarter from that 

organization.  So I picked...came to the right.  He gave me  some  food, whatever he had and

feed...fed me .  This was Sunday and about...I was there about an hour.  She told me  to rest.  

All of a  sudden she got pale, pale and white.  She looked out and she saw that German

He wasn't  the chief of the police but assistant police but he was the murderer of Rovno Jews. 

 He...they claime d that he was sitting with the machine gun by the grave and he by himself 

killed most of the Jews.  This was the mother. 
 

Q: What was her name, or his name?  

 

A: His name  was We inka (ph).  So she said my son is a bad boy.  Even they come  in, if they see 
you here you wouldn't live two mi nutes, but she had a back door and the back door was 

leading to the out...outhouse.  She says when they come  in on the horses, you run out and 

when the come  into the house, I give them drinks and you run away.  I did.  I did and I 

walked another two days and I came and I found Jewish, ma ybe twelve families living in the 

woods.  It was already cold.  It was snow over there ____.  They had built up from wood 

houses.  They had a fire in in the back. There was no chimney and the fire was going out 

through the outside.  You couldn't stand up because the smoke was killing you.  You could

ma de out of...from the from the leaves.  Everything was ma de out of leaves from the woods, 

and there were ma ybe five or six houses.  And then I me t a fellow which was a barber.  

He...he was at my wedding in New York.  I don't know where he is now.  He was from 

Poland so he...the other people were from the small...from the other towns.  They were...I 

was a...you know, Poland considered ____.  He was 
with his wife and daughter and another 

girl and he said he would take me into his house.  I should stay with him, because I was 

alone and I was from Poland, and he was actually the rich ma n because he had a profession 

and he went in to the...there was also a Polish village there from the people what Poland put 

in, there was a whole village.  So he went in there and to cut their hair.  He was a 

professional barber, and he had food he had brought
 in. But he had food for hims elf.  We  had 
to go at night or in daytime and to beg for food.  My shoes were gone, so I had from wood 

ma de, you know, rags and that and around and we were every...once a week we were going 

to to the villages and to ask for food.  The Polish village was too far and it was cold but the 

Ukrainian village was closer.  One day I went into a village with another girl.  The girl which 

was was theirs.  She later died, and we knocked on the door and the la...my feet were already 

swollen because from the cold the shoes fell off.  She took some thing rubbing it should go 

away.  She gave me  food and start knocking at the door.  They knocked on the door, came in 

Ukrainian ______.  You knew that the  _____ who come  in, they'll see a Jewish fellow  

They'll kill us.  They came in and one ma n was from from Tuchin and he knew about my 

father, about Gros, so he said today we don't kill Jews.  That was his word. I reme mber when 

they knocked.  They came in, about five, six me n, so I asked him how come .  You see, 

because it was...I asked questions which normally, in normal time you don't...you don't ask, 

but there was a question that I knew they do, you understand, and I asked him that question 

how come  you don't kill today, so he said because we are now negotiating with the Russian 

partisans to fight against the Germans and it will take about another three days, and we better 

not catch you.  If it doesn't  go through, we better not catch you in three days.  They gave me  

the best food what I had in months.  They treated me  nice and they told me  to go, so actually 

it's just like you were in the lion's...in the lion's den and you escaped in the right time.  So 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
16 
 
you see, I...so I start asking myself questions, how can luck bring you because he told me if 
we would catch you yesterday, we would have killed you because this just came out.  So I 

went back and I stayed there in the woods, you know, but I was hungry.  You had to go 

again to eat.  What did we get?   We get potat
oes.   Boiled potatoes without salt, the stomach 
can ____ but that was the only thing what they gave us and some ...we had places.  One time

took...you know, for a fork what with they cut hay and he he throwed at me .  I jumped out.  I 

was young still and I jumped out.  I was alert and it went through the wood.  Otherwise it

else, the same  Ukra...the Ukrainians gave me  food.  They gave me  a few potatoes and some

it's the matter (ph).  They live good now.  But a month later I went again with the same...I I 

walked with the same girl.  There was other places but she lived in the same...in the same 

house so we went to back together.  You had to  go about three, five miles.  This 

was...already the snow was very high but we always tried to go when it's snowing that the 

Germans shouldn't come  back and find out where we are, so when the snow start falling, we 

walked and then it fell back so it shouldn't leave any...you get...when you live in the woods, 

you get very smart.  You...you learn.  Though I never lived in a small town or small 

village...I was born in a big city, you get to learn like _____, you know.  You get to learn 

how to live with the nature and I remember we walked out to a village and maybe thirty 

people, Ukrainians, surrounded us, both of us and they said where should be kill them.  Here 

or in the woods?   The woods was like from here to next block, two blocks so they...the 

others said why should we kill here.  We 'll take them to the woods.  There nobody had to 

bother with him and while I was talking, the leader was talking to me, an old lady, an old 

woma n, came out and she happened to be the mother of the leader. 
 

Q: You're saying that the same  old lady you'd seen before?  

 

A: No, no, no, no.  This was different story. The mother of the the other one was a police 
Ukrainian...a German Ukrainian policeman.  He...this one was a ________.  They were 

partisans.  See, it's different...between working for the Germans as police and being, you 

know, like like a like SS.  Those were partisans.  They were fighting.  See, the Germans, the 

Ukrainians worked for the Germans, were German helpers on the German payroll.  This 

were Ukrainian partisan which wanted a fr ee Ukraine.   They were nationalists.  They killed 

Jews the same way.  It has nothing to do but with the nationalists, their aim was not to so 

much love to the Germans but love to the country, to to Ukraine and to have a free...and they 

thought the Germans would give them which they would never do, but they thought the 

Germans would give them a free Ukraine.  Right.  You see, you know, politics was involved 

in that, but that was a different...but the old lady, the mother from the leader, from that 

Ukrainian run out and she grabbed the gun from him.  I remember a small lady and he was a 

tall guy, a strong guy.  Somehow he didn't expect because the mother, she start to to hug him 

and she grabbed the gun and she was holding the gun to him, and she said those are two

children.  If you kill them, I'll kill you.  I I remember that the other Ukrainians, you know, 
they they got they got kind of shocked, you know.  She was a good woma n.  She meant it 

just why should they kill us.  And they said run.  Run to the woods.  We  start running and 

every mi nute, even the the five hundred or thousand yards was like miles because I thought 

some body from them would shot me , but she would have killed him probably.  They would 

shot me  in the back.  We  run in the woods and we were free already.  We  were saved.  Again 

things like that doesn't  happen, but it happened.  But we realized...there were about five boys 

of us and my age...we realized that there's no life to go and beg and to to be killed, you 

know.  Some day the luck will run out and the same  time we we dropped the Polish, the the 

Ukrainian villages and went further  to the Polish villages, but the Polish village, the Polish 

people...there were three hundred and eighty people 
there.  They were very nice to us.  They 
gave us food.  They were working with the partisans and one day they were surrounded by 

Germans.  The Germans sent in the army, the regular army and they took all the men and 

they shot them.  Three hundred and eighty people they shot.  The wome n, they shot and they 

killed them.  They they poisoned.  They didn't shot them but they gave them some  some  

injection, some thing.  Nobody, not one survived from that the whole village.  That was a few 

villages, Polish villages, where they shot everybody.  They did the same  thing what they did, 

claimi ng that they are sympathetic to the to the partisan, to the Russian partisans.  So we...the 

roads to beg or to eat were cut off, so we decided, five of us, that we are going to look for the 

partisans.  We knew that the Russian partisans, there was a Russian partisan by the name of 

______.  That's Colonel Niewiedow (ph).  Niewiedow.  They were the lead partisan 

organization in the whole Ukraine which eight
y percent were sent out from Moscow.  

Normally there were two kind of partisans, the Russians.  There were partisans they 

organized, natives, whoever wanted but the Ukrainians were against the Russians, so they 

didn't have much to organize.  They had a very rough deal because they were against them, 

so they had to bring Russian people to fight the Germans, and those were the the true 

partisan uh ______ to send out, you know, from  _____. Later I found out seventy percent 

were Spanish people, not for Spanish but Spain, for Franco (ph), the ones what were in the 

civil war.  That was a real intellectual...the 
real...the war that's comi ng in was were fighting 
Franco.  When Franco won the war in Spain, they went to Russia and Russia didn't play 

much.  They trained them and they they...Russian always was like England, fighting to the 

last Eng...to the last Indian soldier.  The Russians did the same thing.  They sent them out 

because it was a very dangerous mi ssion, to send out the Spanish Communists.  Again, they 

didn't want them in Russia because they had enough Communists there.  OK.  As you can 

see, I'm not such a great lover although they saved my life, you know, but that's the truth.  

That was Spanish...very fine, very fine pe
ople, very...very...they were not the average 
Russian partisan, the average soldier.  Each one was with a personality.  We met some 

Ukrainian...some partisans and they told us sorry, we don't take.  What did you do?   See, 

without without ammunition.  We said how we get ammunition.  Go take a stick and kill a 

German, take his gun or his rifle and come  to us.  Then you'll fight.  It's easier said than to do 

because the Germans were twelve feet tall in our eyes.  We  were young and anyway the 

Germans were the the the rulers there.  How can you go and kill?   I I stayed away as far as I 

can fr om a German and they told us to take a stick and kill a German.  Again, the same story. 

 Everybody was _____.  So we decided, four of 
us, four or five young boys...there's  only way 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
18 
 
how to get to the partisans, cause we knew we can't  survive. We  didn't know when it's going 
to end and the woods was cold.  It was forty below zero with no clothing, no food, no 

nothing.  The older people stayed there.  We'r e going to see how the the horses with the with 

the sleds, and we'r e going to follow and it happened that we saw a partisan with a sled and he 

happened to be Jewish.  We  went over to him.  We  told him who we are.  He said I can't  take 

you, but follow...don't say a word but follow my road and you'll get there.  That's all he said. 

 He went away.  We  waited for an hour.  It wasn't  snowing, and we followed.  We  followed 

ma ybe five, six miles, and once we we were going, they came out and said hand, you know, 

raise your hands.  And they took all five five of us separate places.  How did you get here?   

So I said we saw...we were looking for the partisans.  We  want to fight.  We  are against the 

Germans and we saw a road.  We  want to fight.  Where are your guns?   We  don't have any 

guns.  We 'r e going to send you back and we ma de up, if they told us they send back, what 

we have to say.  We  have to say two things we agreed.  We  want to be killed by a Russian 

bullet, not by German.  That was appeal (ph) to the Russians, and if they...if we'll see they 

don't want to take us, they should be aware that if the Germans catch us, we don't...we're not 

responsible what we'r e going to say.  We  had to use threat.  To use threat to the Russians was 

pretty desperate, but we had no other way.  They they took each one because they thought 

they didn't know. 
 

Q: And these these were the parti...the partisans?  

 

A: These were partisans. 

 

Q: The the Russians? 

 

A: Yes. They didn't know if the Germans sent us. They didn't know how we got there and they 
were...had to be careful too so they took each one separate and start asking questions, how 

we got to them, because if we can get to them, the Germans can get to them.  You 

understand?   So we didn't blame them.  They h
eard one saying we want to...we want to fight. 
 We  wanted this, and they decided to take us in because...decided not because we want to die 

for them but they were afraid that if the Germans catch us, they would...we will say...I mean 

they would say or some thing...they will they will force us, you know, to to say where they 

are.  So the Germans were not close, but they were afraid to go in because they didn't know 

how strong the partisans are, and they also didn't know...you can't  attack somebody in the 

woods because a division can't  do...they didn't have that ma ny divisions but they can't  send 

in because they don't know where they'r e going to be hit.  You can hide, you know, three 

people, ten people, a hundred can keep up a whole a whole brigade if you don't know where 

you're going to be hit.  Soon as they took us in, they took all our clothes because we were in 

a horrible stage.  They burned everything what 
we had.  They gave us new clothing.  It was 
like a paradise.  They gave us...they had the same  thing ma de from wood, but they had I 

reme mber _____ uh uh Persian carpets were laid down.  It was some thing like a new life.  

Next day came out.  They took us to the comma ndant, you know, to the chief took us there, 

starting to ask the story, and who was sitting th
ere...Gros.  Gros saw me .  Start hugging.  The 

comma ndant looked...start hugging and kissing me .  He said why didn't you say some thing.  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243

How would I know?   We  would have taken you in right away and I told him.  He took me  
away.  He was the engineer, the ____.  He was the...this this partisan specially was sent in to 

break, to undermine bridges.  The Germans were sending trains to the front and they also cut 

the woods in order to be safe because they had machine guns on top because the partisans 

were...their mi ssion was to destroy all the trains because if you less ammunition will go to 

the front, the less the Russians will be killed and that was their mi ssion.  They were ______. 

In Russian it is ______.  Their mi ssion was to to...very dangerous there because about 

twenty feet, thirty feet they cut out all the 
woods so you had to take off the train and they 

were standing on top watching, so what did we
 do?   We  undermined and we were staying 
there and we, you know, like...how to explain to it...turn off the trains when they were 

shooting us, we had to  run away right away and it was a quick...a hit and mi ss but the train 

had to go.  So they had to train us.  It took time, but in the meantime I asked Gros what 

happened and I was telling him the story because I didn't know what's happened in Tuchin, 

what has...so he was telling me  and I found out the truth, that after when they burned the 

ghetto, my...when I was running through the woods, my father, my sister, they were stayed 

together and some twenty other people what work
ed in the factory and Gros himself went to 
the bunker.  They were there for three days because there was enough prepared food, 

everything.  And a Ukrainian told the German and they shot everybody except Gros.  They 

pulled Gros...he should train...Jews (ph)...he shoul
d train Ukrainians in the factory they 
should work.  Naturally they didn't they didn't do nothing to the false Deutch, so they had 

there and Gros.  Gros told me  that he was in contact with the partisans.  He was working all 

the time...from the beginning he was in contact
.  He was working on both sides.  He knew 
what the Germans, everything was told to the high echelon, to the partisans, so he was like 

like a double...you understand.  But so Gros realized there's no more Jews.  Why should he 

train them.  Next day they send in partisans and they took George, and they took Gros with 

them.  He became the assistant from the comma n...from the comma ndeer (ph) for he was an 

engineer.  We  had to build bridges.  We  had to do that.  He was...he was very high up, you 

know, almost the second in comma nd.  I told George, Gros, he kind of felt kind of in a way 

that I'm the only survivor, that special...you know, watch.  I I told him, first of all I told him 

about Weinka.  See I knew only...deep down at that time I had the worst hatred to Ukrainians 

because I saw what they did, and the Germans came in.  They went knives and they were 

cutting than to Germans, because I didn't see with my own eyes any atrocities from 

Germans, but I saw from Ukrainians what they...whatever your eyes see, you understand.  

From the Germans I heard, I knew, but Ukrainian I saw with my own eyes, so I told them 

about We inka.  He's dead, and they took care of We inka with with the family, but I asked 

one question.  I asked a favor from the chief, fr om the from the few people what they sent to 

We inka.  They caught We inka on a Sunday...to save the mother because she gave me  food.  

In the state where Weinka lived in the house, they digged out maybe thirty to forty graves, 

pieces.  They found chandeliers, all the Jewish from Rovno, gold, silver...not pieces but I 

would say tons.  You know, great big big things 
what Weinka with their three brothers, what 
they had over there put away and mostly silver things.  You know, mostly religious silver 

things which which...he definitely didn't have it when his father.  They took care of We inka 

with the family.  Then... 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
20 
 
Q: When you said they took care, they...what did they do?  
 

A: I don't want to even go into that what they did to him, but he didn't die a nice death.  They 
hanged him but they burned him also.  I mean whatever he did to twenty-two thousand 

people was not enough, but that's all what could be done and and Gros told to the 

comma nder that they should listen to me  what...I was I was...you know, I was a new recruit, 

but I had some body behind me .  Again, and to ____ and they they did to We inka things 

which in a in a normal society, you don't do, OK.  But the mother...I said not till she run 

away.  I was sorry for her because she she gave me  food.  You know, it wasn't  there, but she 

had children like that what they they were murderers.  Not only murderers but but they they 

they were the known...Weinka...I don't know if anybody else...I never me ntioned We inka 

before until now and I don't know if if...but this is the We inka what what was sitting...people 

from Rovno me ntioned he was sitting near the grave with the machine gun and he was 

shooting people, so how could I...you see, the funny thing is that I always had even now 

feelings, blood, that I can't  see blood.  I faint.  I used to faint when I was a child and I even 

faint now when I see blood.  I didn't faint when I saw We inka's blood.  My heart turned to 

stone and I had only lived for revenge and revenge ma kes you an animal.  You know, it 

doesn't ...it takes away all humil...humility.  It takes you...it makes you wild, a beast and and I 

knew that I'm only a few survivors.  I didn't know how ma ny people survived, you know, in 

that time, but I knew I'm the one and as long as I'm alive and I have the power, I have to do 

to take advantage.  OK.  (Crying) 
 

Q: Just take a mome nt.  It's OK. 

 

A: I also wanted to take care of Michau (ph).  Michau killed Kagan for no reason, for gold, but 
the wife and the child didn't do anything.  Michau
 was a different case.  He was an individual 

murderer, you know, and I always lived not to hurt things, to people what they didn't do 

nothing, only what they did and not by associati
on.  I didn't want to kill Michau.  I didn't 
want to do anything to Michau but I told again through Gros to the partisans what Michau 

did and the funniest thing is I forgot one thing to me ntion.  In the partisans, I found Kagan's 

daughter.  When she run away in the woods, the partisans caught her.  Being a girl, they took 

her.  But I was very disappointed.  She fell in love with a...I saw her...a ma tter of fact, in the 

partisans she was sick.  She had some cold.  They had a little hospital for...they had doctors 

there.  It was a whole...it it wasn't  just a few...a few partisans.  It was a whole like a battalion, 

you know, people, hundreds of people.  I saw her and I told her that, you know, Michau 

killed your father and that and she was kind of 
indifferent.  I don't know if what happened to 
her, what her mi nd was...I really don't know, so I realized that with her I can't  do much.  I 

told Gros and Gros gave an order.  They shot...they they throw Michau to the to the...they 

took him to the woods and they shot him.  They shot him also because they are afraid that he 

will be a traitor.  If he could do like that, he will be a traitor to the Germans, and the partisans 

didn't play in that time too much with human life.  Huma n life was very, very cheap.  So we 

went with the partisans. We stayed there for a long time until one day... 
 

Q: Let me assess this.  When you with the partisans, did you participate in in raids?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
21 
 
 
A: In everything.  There was no, no...nothing was Gr
os should try to save me  or nothing.  He 
wouldn't do that.  He wouldn't do that.  He...Gros was a very principle...he had a principle 

and he didn't...he...I...in raids and burning and and dangerous thing.  He he was like whatever 

has to do with death, my my luck, you know, and he would never go against, you know, 

because they knew, his chief knew and everybody knew that he is my protegee, so he 

wouldn't save me  for for anything.  It would be some thing serious.  If I would do some thing 

wrong, probably he would try to save me , but
 to go...missions had nothing to do with him 
because he was not a military leader.  He was only their assistant to the ___ but he was 

mostly building bridges, preparing how to do things, but he was not the one what told them 

how to go to shoot, to break up the bridges, so I participate and not...all of us, all five of 

us...there was no difference.  After a while they told us, they spending...spent day and night.  

They told us how to do and what to do and how to break and how to put the dynamite and 

how to escape and how to death (ph) and who was wounded, just like anybody else, and it 

was going around for six months I would say.  One day...and I didn't know why and when...it 

was already '43.  They send us...they took us, all five of us, and they said you are dismissed 

from the partisans.  Never happened...nobody is dismissed.  You...only you you you die or 

they shoot you, you know.  We  didn't do anything wrong.  We  didn't do anything.  I was...we 

were disappointed.  What do you mean you're going to dismiss us?  But we cooled off a little 

bit.  Gros came out, not to them, to me .  He said we are going on a very serious mi ssion.  

We 'r e going together with Kovpak (ph).  Kovpak was the biggest partisan...was a whole 

army, and we'r e going to fight with the German
 army, playing (ph) very serious mi ssion and 

you are five young boys.  I can't  dismiss you alone.  I want you should be alive.  The war is 

going to pretty soon end, and I want you should survive, some body should survive.  I can't  

do it to you alone.  I have to do it to all five of you, so don't feel bad that you didn't fight 

good, that you are not good soldiers, but I want to do that thing for you.  He took in clothing, 

regular clothing, you know, to barter, to to live some thing.  They send us out.  We felt...even 

all that, we felt kind of disillusioned, as a child, you know.  We found out two months later 

that they they killed sixty percent of the of the partisans.  The whole German army when 

starting...the Russians starting comi ng back, they had an order to fight the German army and 

the partisans had no heavy artillery, nothing heavy and how could they survive.  They they 

they...I never knew what happened to Gros.  I later heard that he was in Poland.  He was a 

mi nister of some thing of...but I never was in touch with him, but in his own way he tried, I 

felt, to save my life and he didn't try to save my life because it was like a symbol.  

Some body...see, because he didn't know either who survived.  It was such a time that we 

didn't know if there is anybody survived.  You understand?   In his eyes, I was the only one 

what survived to be to tell the story, so I took...we got back to the same place where we were 

and we'r e waiting and three months later the army came, the Russian army.  And at that same 

place with us was the Polish family, the one what told me , the policeman...he was hiding 

there too because the Ukrainians wanted to kill him.  And the Russian army came in.  We 

heard that the Russian army on Rovno, you know.  It was around thirty kilome ters, thirty-

five kilometers, forty, where we were.  I don't remember how many kilometers...it's not 

important.  He told me , you know, Heinrich (ph), let's go back now.  We  are safe.  And I said 

you know, I want to go back with the soldiers.  I wanted soldiers.  I wanted to see Russian 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
22 
 
soldiers.  I don't want to go back, and it so happened that a day later, one day later, came in a 
column of Russian soldiers, the Russian army.  All of us what we were there ___ went with 

them to go to the city.  And about fifty miles, we fell on him.  We  went to a Ukrainian town. 

 We  saw him and his family.  He he had about five, six children, young children, Polish 

people, cut in pieces, directly in pieces, all of them killed by Ukrainians.  So you see it was 

again...I didn't go with him.  If I would be go...gone with him...it was some thing hold back I 

shouldn't go.  There was no reason, but some thing...I don't know...no wisdom, no no no 

shrewdness, no smartness told me not to go, but after then they...the Ukrainians killed them 

because they were again against the Russian.  They were fighting.  They lost...their bitterness 

was they lost their independent Ukraine which they never had in a way.  You understand?   

But their their hatred was so great, so they figured...they...he was against them.  He was a 

Polish.  They would kill him.  We  came back to Rovno, to town.  This is a new chapter 

starts.  Do I have to...I would like to stop for a mi nute.   
 

Q: OK.  OK.  Why don't you...yeah, we can stop now.  Why don't you take a... 

 

A: I I I am thinking I'm doing better than I thought.

...town, small town, to kill not so much individual Germans but to to kill the livestock, to kill 
the food, to kill what they...you know this Ukraine, that was the best gift from there, so they 

had a hit mi ssion to kill, to burn livestock and and corn and wheat...food for the German 

army.  This was what they did. They avoided Germans.  Naturally where army was they 

were too big because we were too small, but our ma in mi ssion was to sub_____, to cause the 

Russians to un...uh explosive train, train with ammunition or what every...every train went 

with soldiers or with ammunition, so what happened the trains are going to the front.  They 

had to go through the woods because everything was woods there so wherever the train 

went, we had mi ssions to destroy the trains, to burn the trains.  Once you are...in the 

beginning was very easy because we went through ___.  The train...the train came and we 

put in uh explosives.  Then they cut...they took Ukrainians and whatever Germans and they 

cut down paths and it was very hard, so we had to hide.  We  had to put...the Germans never 

knew where it's going to hit, but they knew more or less where the partisans are so we 

put...what they did they they they started to use empty wagons in the front.  When it...the 

ammunition will go up, the empty train should come and the train should stop and they 

should go further.  Fix it and go further, so we had...our mi ssion was harder so we had to 

wait and let the empty trains go through and when the train came, the real train came...it was 

right after and they had on the top soldiers with machine guns, with heavy machine guns and 

if they saw any moveme nt, they stopped and they had their very, very...they had hundreds of 

soldiers in in in the big trains with this heavy ammunition to the front watching them, so the 

mi nute they saw any moveme nt, they stopped and they were after us, so we had to stay there, 

watch, put in the explosives and stay in the back in the woods, one side and the other side 

and when the train came in to detonate.  Once they did, it was a tumult and they start 

shooting.  Partisans were hit.  Partisans were killed, but we didn't have no mi ssion to fight 

anybody, any Germans.  To kill a German or ______, this was not our mi ssion.  Our mi ssion 

was to escape.  This was because there was no reason to...the only...the mi ssion was to do 

that much damage that the train should not...once they start burning, it was ammunition then 

_____.  Especially we were looking for oil and gas.  They had to...every train had also a lot 

of gas, you know, for the tanks.  That was the ma in thing because once it started burning, the 

whole train went and it also interrupt...interrupt
ed the...everything for the war effort.  This 

was the _____...and we had also every few days planes came, throw us in ammunition 

because we didn't have it.  We couldn't build it, but planes came in.  We had torches and they 

came in and and the Germans were there.  Plenty times the Germans came with planes and 

they were shooting us down.  We  had to be pretty careful because they were strong.  They 

were powerful and we were under the ground, but this was the ma in mi ssion is to go in 

there...but they were also watching.  Planes 
were watching, flying through to go in and to 
detonate the trains.  I didn't do...we didn't do it every day, not everybody.  It was organized.  

Some  people did that, some  that...we didn't do every second day.  That was not...our mi ssion 

was very nerve-breaking, very very dangerous 
and it was I would say I went twelve, fifteen 
times to do that all the time while I was there in the partisans.   Because they had also more 

experienced, older...they were also...we were young, you know, especially me .  There was 

more experienced people what had through (ph) , and they wanted...they didn't send me  just 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
24 
 
out to to to do it to get killed.  You understand?   So...but they did send out and we went out 
just like anybody else, but not as often as the experienced, older soldiers.  They were...they 

were trained...more trained than I.  They had schooling.  They had...you understand?   But we 

went as helpers.  I was not as the prime, the prime soldier, but we went just...the bullets cut 

us just like them.  That's uh...that's what...that's the story what I...what I remember. 
 

Q: OK.  Let's go back uh to where you were before, how you returned to Rovno with the 
Russian army. 
 

A: Oh.  How we returned?   We  saw the soldiers who went to Rovno.  We  went with the... 

 

Q: OK.  This is...this is uh what year...just to back up, so this is what, in 1943?  

 

A: I think it was already the beginning 1944.  I really don't remember the date. 

 

Q: But it was winter?  

 

A: Wi nter.  The Russian came in.  They took Rovno and a few weeks later we came to...we saw 
a column, you know...not the ma in army but just one part of the of the army, you know, on 

horses.  It was not tanks, not the big...the heavy...because it was the woods and they just 

happened to go through.  We  went with them, and we went with them.  We  went to Rovno 

and Rovno was already free and we actually went...all what they survived went to one house, 

and we stayed there two, three days, not longer.  And they surrounded us.  After three days... 
 

Q: They?  

 

A: The Russian army and they took every young, able-bodied ma n to the army.  They took us to 
the army.  There was not too ma ny, you know, but whoever...see, whoever didn't live in that 

building what we we came because people...there was other people, survivors, which we 

didn't know.  Whoever they didn't know, they didn't...they didn't...but we knew.  We  were 

like naive and came.  We thought that the war is over for us.  If we meet...the war started.  

You understand?   Under norma l circumstances, the war should have been over.  The 

Russians came in.  We  came back.  The war should be over.  All of a sudden being Russia 

was Russia, they took us.  We  told them we fought...we fought already.  We  were partisans.  

There was nobody to talk to.  We still have...that's what they said.  The Germans are not 

finished yet.  We  were not in Berlin yet.  So they took us to Russia, to deep Russia.  They 

send us to school to be to be preparing for the army.  They knew already with us that we 

knew what we'r e doing.  While I...starting a very...a very tricky story with the army.  While I 

was in the army, they also took thousands of Ukrainians which they...and they...and 

they...Russia had a policy at that time which I knew and and later I found out that they don't 

take Ukrainian and send on that front where they home but they have to send them to a 
different place because they were in strange territory because they didn't trust them.
  And 
the Russian didn't care that I'm Jewi sh, that I am...I'm not a...I'm not running for the 
Germans
.  They were all one.  The Russian policy doesn't  mean anything but their policy

was that all the people from Rovno, to take to a strange front, to the opposite, not to...not...to 
strange territory, and I wind up with a division 
what ninety percent were Ukraine, from 
Rovno, from _____, which the biggest nightma re for me .  Why?   Because I knew that they 

all enemies.  They all Fascists, just like the Germans.  The same Ukrainians what...you 

understand the _____, and the Bulbas, this what what they were killers are here in the army 

with me  together, and I knew that I would be shot every mi nute in the back.  Who will 

know?   Who will care?   One night I was on the front.  For me  it was one nightma re.  On the 

front was already a different story.  I was w
ith a heavy machine gun and maybe sixty to a 
hundred feet...you know, the front is here and the Germans were on the other side, and I 

always kept two grenades with me  in case the Germans catch me  not to catch me  alive.  You 

know, it was a a fear which it was in me .  Dead was not a ques...there was no fear.  That 

itself was nothing because I went through so many times that it really became like a like a 

play...suffering.  I was scared.  So instead of the Germans should catch me, I better kill 

myself, so I kept two grenades in case of some thing happen, and one night I was standing 

with my machine gun in the front.  On the other side were Germans, and five Ukrainian from 

my...I heard noise.  Five Ukrainian tried to run over to the Germans.  Four I wounded and 

one I killed, you know, because I thought the Germans are comi ng to me .  They send out 

Russians in the morn...in the morning and they caught the four and they said they wanted to 

go to the Germans.  They were not the only ones.  The whole division would have gone over 

to the Germans, because their heart was not in Russia.  Their heart was with Germans.  I was 

a hero.  Next day they took twenty thousand...the the the headquarters from the army made a 

big...see Russian like propaganda.  In order to give heart to the army, they are experts in 

propaganda, and they had to...every day wa s hours of propaganda and hours of inter...you 

know, to fight was some thing because there was no other belief.  There was no food, but 

they had to give some thing so they gave propaganda, you know, to bring out, to fight until 

death for the...they didn't say they'r e fighting for the father...for the Communism.  In that 

time the policy changed.  They'r e fighting for their fatherland, also for the motherland.  

________, the motherland for ______.  The motherland everybody understood, what the 

motherland.  Communism was not too ma ny takers
, so this went on...there was probably was 
twenty, twenty-five thousand soldiers.  It was a general.  It was...it was the whole..whole few 

divisions together after that deal, and they asked me I should give a speech.  I was never a 

speaker.  My Russian wasn't  too good, but I reme mber the speech what I gave.  I gave a 

speech that we have to fight.  We  have to go forward, you know.  I wrote one of the _____ 

speech, but I remember it by heart, that every step... 
 

Q: Repeat the speech, if you say you can reme mber.  That'd be... 

 

A: Yes, I reme mber.  Friend  ______, you know, this friend...I was under the Germans.  It's true. 
 And I saw...I didn't talk like a Jew.  I talked like a Russian.  And I saw what the German 

doing to our brothers and sisters, Ukrainians, Jews, Polish, that they'r e killing them.  They 

destroy them, that nobody except the German race is important.  But deep down I heard that 

the German...the biggest mi stake, we were talking in the army, that they'r e killing prisoners, 

Russian prisoners, in that time already that the Russians knew that the Germans are killing 

thousands of Russians and you have to fight not 
for...we're not fighting against Russia.  We  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
26 
 
have to fight against Germans because they'r e killing us because we are sla...we are 
under...under _______, sub-human.  We ...now I'm talking as a Russian.  You understand?   

We  are sub-human...not as a Jew but as a Russian...and the Germans, if they catch us, they'r e 

killing us because we are not the German race.  They are the high race.  So I had to talk to 

them in the same language and I said that I saw what they'r e doing to us and I was there and I 

came back and I'm fighting now with you together and every step what we'r e going forward, 

closer to kill the beast, we are helping humanity.  We are helping ourselves, making short 

and sweet.  And there were tremendous...treme ndous...you know, they they were happy with 

my speech, you know, and I and I talked to it what I meant with my heart because _____.  I 

knew that they are the only ones what they can kill the Germans.  See, that mi nute there was 

no Ukrainian anymore, but I was scared that the thousands of Ukrainians were there and they 

will hear this speech and I wouldn't live.  The following night while I was there came over to 

me a man, an officer.  This is getting a little bit very...and he said are you...are you the in the 

partisans.  Yes.  Are you a Ukraine?   Are you Jewish?   Yes.  He didn't have no insignia, no 

nothing.  Do you know who I am?   I said no.  He said how were the Ukrainian behaving?   I 

said they were behaving...because I already shot four, you know, wounded so they knew that 

I'm not from them.  He knew already.  How did they behave?   They were anti-Russian, anti-

Polish, anti-Jewish and for everything they were for Germans.  You know a lot of them here?  

 I said I know people here what they killed Jews during the war.  And I know one what was a 

______ but he...this one was there too. The one...he 
was a teacher, but I found out that he 
was leaning for Communism what what...in the _____ what told me  we don't kill Jews, he 

was dead too.  He became friendly with me .  Again, he saved me . He told me  that.  I was 

friendly with him and I was telling him everything, and I said there's hundreds of them here 

what what from Tuchin, from Rovno, what...  Do you...can you give us the name s?   I am 

from _______.  Yes.  I heard the name  but you you don't repeat that name .   
 

Q: Can you explain what it is?  

 

A:  _______ is uh CI...CIA.  Contra...what is the the CIA..._______ is contra...uh what is it?  

 

Q: Central Intelligence Agency. 

 

A: Central Intelligence...contra...central intelligence  ____.  In that time I couldn't understand 
Russian good.  I though bad.  _____ is bad.  And this...but it's spelled different.  The name  is 

________.  That's a very secret, top secret orga
nization which they had a right...they were 
above everybody, above the _____ which was very scaricy (ph), very fearsome , but they had 

a right to go to any any officer, any general,  anything.  They were the upper, upper without 

question.  It's not...even here I think uh don't have that much right that they had a right to 

check everything.  They were the top _____.  He is from there, and you are working for us 

from now on.  I really didn't know what he is telling me , what did there...and I want to 

have...you should check out everybody what was against for the Germans.  We  know that 

this division has a lot of traitors and a lot of Ukrainians which killed...did a lot of atrocities 

and I want you should give me  the name s.  In a way I was very thrilled, to be honest with 

you, because again we'r e going back to my ma in enemies.  I didn't know what they do...from 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
27 
 
the other side I knew they'r e going to kill me because even without knowing, but secret, 
nobody should know.  Nobody ____, that I should...I know a lot of things, but  this ma n, he 

knows more names than I do because I really don't know the names.  I I can't  point out 

because I...you understand?   I wasn't  their friend.  I only knew what they did.  We  can't  talk 

to him but you should talk to him that he should give you, and and we gave him a list.  Three 

hundred people...two hundred people, from...all 
from Rovno, from Tuchin, all the people 
what were involved what when the police he knew...because he was in the in the _______.  

But after a week there was no name s anymore.  We  we couldn't find any more whom to give. 

 What they did with the people, with the Ukrainians, I really don't know and I don't want to 

know.  I didn't see them what they did with them.  They used me  and I wanted to be used.  

After a few weeks, they start comi ng to me .  I said I'm sorry.  I don't know anybody else.  He 

start pushing and they can persuade and there was nothing to do, nothing to...you can't  get 

out nothing and I was stubborn.  I said no.  I found out later they want to get rid of me , the 

Russian.  How to get rid of me ?   They sent out twenty-four people to catch a German in 

daytime and I suspect it was organized.  I mean they used to it from time to time, but I 

suspect the ma in culprit was organized through them.  So I don't know...for a few years ago 

with Russia I would talk like that even, but now 
I can say it.  I suspect they organized to get 
rid of me  because they didn't want to have any witnesses.  We  were here and the Germans 

were three...in three ways surrounded so they told us to take...a ____ means a tank...a 

German to find out their position.  In the daytime was suicide.  It was no much suicide that 

fr om twenty-four, twenty-two got killed.  One was cut his legs off.  He was inside of and I 

was wounded in my arm and my leg inside off and I was only one what survived in that 

ma ssacre (ph).  Again, I was cut off from my my legs here.  My...here I was bleeding from 

my from my...near my  heart.  I thought my heart was hit, was bleeding.  And I was laying 

and I throw away my machine gun and I run back.  I run back while I was wounded and 

bleeding because they started for an hour to...t
he the...they thought that we'r e going in from 

the front to fight them.  They started for an hour to bombard, you know, to...our position.  

Didn't mean nothing in the army because one did that, but it didn't happen too often.  

Meantime I was bleeding and I thought I'm dying (laughter) because the blood was comi ng 

so strong that I thought my heart is wounded.  Came  over an officer.  I don't know who it 

was.  Again, without insignia and he said where's you gun.  I'm going to shoot you.  Why did 

you leave  your gun there?   So I said....you see in Russia one thing...if you gave your blood 

for the ___, for the country, the mi nute when your blood runs, nobody can touch you.  You 

are a holy ma n, you know.  Later they can do whatever they want, but the mi nute when your 

blood runs, you can say anything.  So I told him why don't you go there and catch...take my 

gun.  You understand?   In the meantime, while they stopped shooting, the general which not 

a political, which didn't know, heard that the guy what gave the speech is wounded, and he 

gave a special order (crying ? )  
 

Q: Take your time.  Take your time. 

 

A: Imme diately they bring me  to a hospital.  It was a very dangerous because you had to go up 
hills but the the Germans saw it, and they _____, but he said without...you know, once you 

get an order...I want to bring him alive to the hospital.  Came an order from the general, right 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243

away was help because I was laying there and bleeding.  Nobody touched me .  Nobody  
came, and this is not norma l.  You know, usually they would send some body.  They were 

dead.  But there was nobody to talk and now I'm talking that for the time out of it.  They 

brought me into the hospital.  Luckily...I remember they put me to sleep and they operated 

on me  and a Jewish doctor __________.  You know, ______ because everybody knew me .  

They knew me  from the speech.  The nurses said look at this.  The boy what gave those...this 

speech is already wounded, you know.  Not that I was such a great hero, but they knew me  

from this speech and that I was I was there, you understand.  Normally, a a plain soldier 

didn't come  and gave speeches for for for an army for twenty-five thousand people, so they 

gave me the biggest care and everything and I went to the hospital.  After after three weeks I 

I recuperate and I was recuperated and the Russi
ans were not too great lovers of my nation 
too, my...at that time, everybody...and I I I remember...I I recuperated already and I was still 

_______ a little bit and I had...I got already two medals.  I got a medal already in the 

partisans.  I got a me dal because I was wounded.  I got, you know, a few things.  Came  over 

a captain and he said why aren't  you on the front.  Why don't you fight?   And I was a partisan 

and I went though much and I hit him once and twice.  To hit an officer, a different story.  

He called me  Jew too.  Why don't you fight?   And again, at that time for me , to tell me  I 

don't want to fight and all from a Russia
n...I expect it from everybody else, you know, but 

from a Russian I...in my youthfulness, in my ___, I expected some  compassion, some thing 

what I went through.  You understand?   So when I hit him, I didn't care what's going to 

happen, so he said ____ why don't you fight, again.  And I recognized that he didn't have any 

me dals.  He was not a army officer.  He was not in the front.  You see, there's all 

kinds...there's there's field comma nder officers wh
at they'r e fighting and to fight on the front, 
in the Russian front, you didn't last more than a week or two.  Either you were dead or you 

were in the hospital.  If you were lucky, you were in the hospital because human life was not 

very much cherished, you know, in the army.  If you were on the front and fighting, you 

didn't last long.  Either you were wounded, you were lucky, and it was a wound you could be 

healed, or you were dead, because they put ma sses, you know, they gave the order and they 

went, they went ma sses of people.  People didn't count.  So so I saw that he wasn't  there, so 

he put me into the they call me to the higher and naturally they call me to the political, the 

assistant.  And the political heard me speak, my speech.  Political every...in every army...in 

the army, the Russian army, every battalion, every thing has a...has an officer of the army 

always and they had a political offi cer.  The political offi cer in a lot of cases has more to say 

than the army.  Not in fighting but everything else because he is the political officer.  The 

political officer knew that I am a friend, that
 I am...they took away...they kept me ...they took 
away the...they didn't take away me .  I don't think they kept the ______ anymore.  You 

understand, because again I had some body watching over me  and he knew that what I went 

through and what ____.  Anyway, I was there and then they, they discharged me  and they 

asked me  what...what I wanted to...should I go further?  
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: I realized then I had enough.  The war was going on.  They were dying, people what I knew 
every day so...and I also realized my love for the Russians...you understand...was not too

great because I don't really fight for something, so I said I want to go to school.  I was very 
good in politics.  In Russia, politics is very important.  Like I told you, I had a very good in 

history, so when they heard, you know, the division or _____, they asked the general who 

came in there, they asked how the political...everyday you had indoctrination of policies, you 

know.  The Russians didn't know from day to day...they didn't even know there who is 

Stalin, so they said he is a great ma n, but you had to answer to Stalin as ____.  You 

understand?   This was the true way.  The Russians, the average Russian...he's a  great ma n.  

Everybody knew he's a great ma n, but they didn't know what position, whether he's chief of 

staff...you know, so they always pushed me  out I should answer.  So they want to send me  to 

political school.  I didn't want to go to political school because I didn't like the system, and I 

didn't want to be...to stay there.  Once I knew I'm going to political school, I stayed there and 

it's not mi ne home.  It's not there.  I want to go back, so I went to tank...to tank school and 

became...that's what it is...I became a...tank school took three months and they taught how to 

fight a tank and that was a dangerous ar...thistank tank the Russians, they took the toughest 

guys, and I was very tough.  I was very strong _______just at home I was raised very weak, 

you know, with Monday, Tuesday sick.  All of a sudden I became very tough.  All that ____ 

from all this life, and tanks were scarce. _____.  You know, the the the...it's just like the 

red...Red Beret, you know, tough guy.  I went there and I was there once...there we'r e 

fighting in there and this was when after the war when Lvov (ph) and we came to the 

___________ and I rode the tanks when they surrendered.  We  got an order and we were 

fighting different fights.  Diffe
rent tanks were burned and out.  I was burned once in a tank, 
but this is just in the army, what you do tanks.  I was told that...they they told us to go 

in...even the Germans surrounded, to go forward and shoot and go to the the ocean because 

we didn't trust ____ and we surrounded them, but they didn't shoot back anymore.  I came 

back.  We  came...you know, it started but before evening, before evening, going back before, 

I I hid myself.  A few months before, there was the chief...I was one day standing guard by 

the general.  The chief of the front for the whole front...you know Russia in that time had 

five...the front means...you know, what the front
...do I say it right in English...five different 
divisions.  They needed ma ybe twenty-five or
 a hundred...fifty divisions on one front.  This 
was the Leningrad front, on that side.  And th
e chief from the tank co...from the tanks...I was 
standing in the near his car.  The wife came out and start talking to me and I found out that 

she is Jewish.  The only general in the Russian army, a four-star general, so the wife had a 

daughter, again my age, and I start...they took me  in.  They start asking me questions and I 

was telling him all the stories what I went though because I had...even for him in the army, to 

tell him from the partisans what the Germans did, he wasn't  aware.  So he said I should be 

adjutant.  I should work for him.  I was very ____, getting away from the from all the...____ 

gave me  beautiful clothes, ___ and I was on staff, an adjutant and I was...he had a higher 

ranking adjutant than I am but I was the one...orderly I would say.  You understand?   But I 

had...I was more than that because I had an insight to him.  I could go anytime the wife, the 

daughter.  He was considered four-star general.  It was very, very high up.   And I was to 

him until actually when they started the division from April because over there the front was 

not moving.  They didn't do nothing because there twenty-two divisions, they didn't want...it 

was not so important.  They knew they wanted to 
take it, but they wanted to take first Berlin, 
so the Russians didn't put in too much.  You know, some times one side was was standing, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
30 
 
just like in the American army, and they were putting more to push to Berlin because there 
there only was the ocean with twenty-two divisions and they knew they there's no way for 

them to escape, so it was dorma nt _____ so there was no real fighting, and while I was not 

fighting, I was his adjutant.  They were preparing, ready, but there was no no danger, no 

fighting until a few days before they took me  to the tank back when they gave the orders to 

fight.  That's how I went into the tank and I wrote that letter that I was sitting in tank.  Before 

I I didn't sit in a tank.  I was far away from it.  I was in there in the headquarters. 
 

Q: This is just a few days before the end of the war?  

 

A: A fe w days before the end of the war.  Oh I was before fi ghting there, but until when I 
became the general's adjutant, I didn't go to a tank anymore, and actually there was no need 

for it because there was no no fighting, but then they...everybody had an order to go.  There 

was nobody...no no exceptions.  When the war...when it ended, when they gave in, I came  

back to the general and I start thinking about living in Russia.  I didn't want to be there.  The 

general told me he'd send me to his Prussia, to get _____, you know, they start living it up 

and he he knew that I know...I'm from Europe.  I know about _______, to fix him up with a 

German estate, you know, and I told him that I wanted to go back.  My...it came an order in 

that time an order from Stalin in the paper I found, that all the Polish nationalists can go to 

the Polish army, so I went in...through the general I went in to the the...actually to the higher, 

to the political, the higher political fr om the army, fr om the whole army and I asked him I 

want to go to the Polish army.  They told me  you are a Jew.  You are not a Polack.  All of a 

sudden, I became a Jew.  And you can't  go back.  I realized that I'm in trouble.  I can't  go...all 

of a sudden I became a Jew and I'm not a Pole but I'm a Pole.  Officially they said...but Stalin 

said in this paper, what he said is good but what we do is a different story.  I had enough 

confidence to the general to...it's only a few mi nutes more and I will finish...to tell him the 

truth, and I told him that my mother is is Polish, not Jewish and she is in Kielce and I want to 

see her.  I didn't see her for five years.  I want to go back and if they don't want me to go 

back, I escape.  I run away back.  I desert.  So he said if you desert, they'll shoot you.  I said I 

would like you should help me  out.  He took me  to Moscow when it was a parade, you 

know.  There, after the war was the greatest parade there.  I went with him.  I had pretty 

good, good life.  He wanted me  to send me  to university.  I had all the privileges what but 

one thing what I didn't want to is to be there.  That was more than anything else.  When after 

when they they told me I would never go back and they will put me...they will put me to jail 

if I if I talk even about it and you see in Russia if you talk too much, because I was...anyway 

____...and you ask too ma ny questions, you didn't survive too long.  I asked...there was once 

a meeting from from the division, our division and they asked us...I asked a question, a very 

naive question but a very norma l question to me  as a westerner, you know, and even if I was 

young, but I learned it and I read about it and I asked a question how come that in before 

Hitler, the ____..._____ was the chief of the Communist Party in Germany...wanted to ma ke 

with the with the with the Socialists, they wanted to go together against the Fascists.  That's a 

fact.  Morris ______...I read about it and I thought it's a normal thing to ask.  If if you're not 

raised in a in a Communist country, you don't know what you can do and what you can't  do.  

Being naive, I said why, if the if the _____, if 
the Communist with the Socialist would have 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0243  
31 
 
gone together, they could have won the Fascists and Hitler wouldn't come  to power.  The 
truth is...I found out later that it is true...but Stalin said no because he didn't want any 

Comm...any Socialists should win in Germany.  
He wanted Fascists.  This way he thought 
there will be a revolution and they...I don't want to go into politics.  They will kill and they 

will...the Communists would take over.  But the question...they told me I will get ten years if 

I wouldn't have political inter...help in knowing...they also realized that I  didn't know what I 

was talking, but mostly the political...if a Russian would ask, he wouldn't see the sun 

anymore because this was a no question.  Some thing what Stalin did that that was enough.  

Anyway, the general told me...I had to put in something from political.  I couldn't I couldn't 

help it.  You can cut out.  I don't care, but this was a naive question which had a 

very...actually the whole...I'm sure historians are thinking about it and talking about it and it 

was...it's a true thing and a sixteen year old boy asked that question, and he could have gotten 

ten years jail or never see the sun, but that was their their system.  The general told me he 

can do one thing for me .  He wants to help me , but I take my life in my hands.  He can give 

me  a pass, you know, in Russia in order to travel to Moscow.  And from there I'm on my 

own.  If I escape, if I...you know, from Leningrad...I was in Leningrad in that time...to 

Moscow was already as a as a soldier.  So I said fine .  And also he can help me  in Bresk 

(ph).  He can get me  to Bresk that I want...he wants some thing there himself.  In Bresk was 

the border between Poland and Russia.  He can give me  a passport to to Bresk, that he needs 

some thing for the army.  He found out some thing is there what he needs for the tanks, some  

factory.  He can get me there. From there, to get over to the other side, if they if they catch 

me , I'm...you know...I went to Moscow.  I was very grateful.  I had a pass.  I was very 

grateful.  This was the greatest mi racle to me which all the stories what happened, and you 

see I was already...while I was working for a general and my outlook, my mi nd _______.  I 

saw once a general and I didn't salute.  So he said and how come  you don't salute to me .  

You're a soldier.  You don't...I said there's so ma ny you are like dogs.  Why should I salute.  

A young general...he looked at me .   Where do you...who are you?   I said I'm working for 

General so and so.  He let me  go.  ____ once you get used to them, you know, to the higher 

echelon, it was much easier than with the lower.  The lower Russians are very tough, very 

indoctrinated, very... 
 

Q: Why...why don't you tell me  about how you got into Poland?  

 

A: OK.  This I want to tell you now.  I went on a train in Moscow.  I was dressed very nicely 
because I was adjutant.  I wasn't  dressed like every soldier, and while I was sitting in the in 

the...I was looking where to find a place and then I saw a general sitting there, a four-star 

general from the ______.  I never saw in my life before a four-star general ______.  There 

was only ______...you heard about...I don't know if you heard about ______...Marshall 

_____, the Chief from the ____ over there, and after him was four-star general and he had a 

wife and he had a very pretty...I was lucky with
 with girls.   He was...he had a pretty young 
daughter, you know, sixteen year old but the wi
fe was very nice and there was room.  
Normally a soldier would never dare say can he sit there.  It it's just unheard of but I was 

used to be around generals.  You understand?   And I asked the general if I am allowed to sit

money, a lot of money, in my purse.  In comparison, a lot of money in rubles to buy food,
