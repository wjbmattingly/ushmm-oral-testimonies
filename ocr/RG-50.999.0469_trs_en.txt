T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.
 
W hat you are about to hear 
f rom  Josie is one individual's account ofthe Holocaust.
 
W ehave prepareda brief slidepresentation to help with her introduction. And we begin wit h aportrait 

of  J o s
i
e Aizenberg wal king in Brussels.
 
She was born March 31 to Jacquesand Fanny Ai zenberg.  Thearrow on this mapof  Belgium points 

to Brussels. T he Germ an Arm y conqueredBelgium  in May 1940. Shortly bef ore the occupation 

Josie'sf ather left Belgiumto join the British Arm y. W e see this photo of  Josie with herparents in 

B ru sse ls.   Jo sie 'sm o t
her was able to secure a hiding placefor Josie in a convent in Bruges, Belgium .  
Here we have Josie and Fanny bef ore she went into hiding. Soon thereaf ter, Fanny who workedfor 

theundergroundor resistance was denounced and deportedto Auschwit z.
 
Af t e r  
six m onthsof  hiding in the conventandgro wing Na zi suspicion, the Belgium underground 
relocated Josie tohide with the Debrackelaers, a Christianf am ily in Brussels.  Here we see Josie with 

the Debrackelaers.  Mr. And Mrs. Debrackelaer are on the right. 
 
To their lef t are neighbors of  Josie's 
grandparents and thefront in them iddle is their grandson. In thef ront to the right is Josie and then 

on thefar lef t in thefront is the Debrackelaers' daughter.  Alliedf orces liberated Belgium in 

September 1944.  Soon after Josie wasf ound by one of her aunts,Fanny's sister.  Here we see 

Josie, Jacques and Fanny af ter they were reunited in Belgium.  Josie would eventually m arry Freddy 

T raum ,alsoa Holocaust survi vor. W e closewith this wedding portrait of Josieand Freddy.  Af ter

Yael were born.
 
T heT raum s relocatedto the United States in1963 to obtainm edical caref orthe disabled son

T heir third, Jonathan,also disabled, was born in the UnitedStates.
 
Eventually Freddy's work broughtthem  to Vienna, Virginia.  Josie returned to school andgraduated 

f rom  the Catholic University of  Am erica school of  social work andbegan her career in child welf are.  

She retired in2008f rom  her work as a clinical social worker f orabused childrenf rom  Montgom ery

tours of the Perm anent Exhibitionf or law enforcem ent, including police off icers, the FBI, judges and 

others.
 
Shealso volunteers wi th Visitor Services.  Josie hasonly recently started speaking publicly abouther 

experience as a Holocaust survi vor.  She now speaks at local synagogues and schools, such as 

Christian academ y and W alter Johnson High School in Montgom ery county, Maryland.  Last year she 

spoketo grades one through eight at legacy school in Carroll County Maryland, which m y son 

attends. She spoke to fif th graders in the District of Colum biaand said she was very im pressed with 

these young studentswho really not only asked great questionsbuteach of them  produced a 

m em orial to the Holocaustand presented it to Josie.  Aspartof  theHolocaust days of  remem brance 

activities last year Josie joined others in reading aloudhere in this museum thenam esof  those killed 

during the Holocaust.  Josie read the namesof  100 victim s, including 12 f rom her and Freddy's

[Applause]
 
>> Josie T raum : T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Josie,welcom e and thank you som uchf orbeing wil ling to beour First Person today.  

W e ha ve  a
 
very large and good crowd and you have som uch to share with us. W e're going to get 
started rightaway.  Yo ur parents Jacques and Fanny Aizenberg we re m arried in '38.  Justbef ore 

Poland attacked inW orld W ar II. T ell us about your parentsandtheir lif e in Brussels, Belgium  during 

the pre
-
war period.
 
>> Josie T raum :  First of all, I want to welcome everyone. T hank youf or com ing. I have alittle 

bronchitis, so bear with m e.
 
My parents, as you said, 
B
ill, were m arried in1938, both of them  were actuall
y in garm ent business.  
My m om  had gone to a textile designing school and she was a dress m aker and she was actually, 

bef ore she gotm arried, she was adressm akerf or the world fam ily i n Belgium.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas a huge honor?
 
>> Josie T raum : T hatwas a big deal. Very few students were chosenf rom  the school when they 

graduatetoactually work with the royalf am ily, so she actually work ed with them and m y dad was not 

alwa ys a tailor, although he was when I was born.  My dad was actually a viol inist, and I'msure you 

can't im agine this, butm any years ago they didn't have talking in the m ovies. T hey were sil ent. So 

when they were silent,they usually hada quartet playing m usic accom panying the movie. You know, 

there was usually a vio linist, piano player,m aybe a cellist, and they hadafew peopleplaying m usic.  

W hen the talkies cam e in, m y dad lost his job.  They didn't needm usicians anymore, sohewent to 

tailoring schoolandactually became a tailor. And so bothm y parents were working in 
that kind of 

business.  My dadhad a store where in those days, again, I keep on saying " thosedays"  but Ihave to 

6 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
rem em ber that was m any years ago.  In those days you couldn't buy a suit ready
-
m ade off the rack 
like you do now.  Youwould go into atailoring shop,pick your m aterial, tweed, regular color or 
whatever, and then the tailor wouldf it you and actually m ake a pattern out of paper andthen 

eventually m ake a suit.  It would take weeks. Andactually a relationship was usually form ed between 

the tailor and the custom er. Som y parents were both working.  My m om  had not 
--
 
was no longer 
workin g f or the royalfam ily when I cam e along, when I was born.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us why you're nam ed Josiane.
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m other really liked a French singer whose name was Josiane, which is the way 

you pronounce m y nam e, but no one could say it when I came to this country, so I becam e Josie. But 

Josiane was a very f am ous French singer, so m y mom  really liked the name.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your parents were married in1938 in late 1938, Nazi power tooka very om inousturn 

in Austriaand Germ any, with Kristallnacht, the Night of  BrokenGlass, and you were born in 1939.  

Do you have knowledgefrom  your parents after thefact as to whether or not they were, at thatpoint, 

living in Belgium ? W ere they f earf ul about the future at that tim e?  Here they were bringin g you into 

the world.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink they were f earf ul. And it was really, in Belgium , it was rum ored and 
thought 

thatthe Germ ans, when they cam eand invaded Belgium , that theywould only deportandarrest the 

m en and leave the wom en and children alone.  Som y dad kind offelt thatm y mom and Iwere saf e 

andheactually heardm any calls on the radio of Britain wanting volunteers to join the British Arm y.  

So eventually m y dadand his brothers went to England and volunteered.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e'll com e back tothat in just am om ent. One more question about that pre
-
wa r  
period. Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, which occurred inGermany andAustria,where 

thousands of Jewish businesses were ransacked anddestroyedand hundredsof  synagogues were 

burned, as a result of that, yourfam ily took in, I believe, a Jewish child to live with youf or a period.

> Josie T raum :  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m om  was actually part of theundergroundandshe would bring in Jewish girls, 
peoplef rom  countries where the Germ ans had already invaded andwere arresting and deporting 

people.
  
She was taking in Jews and hiding them . W e would always have some people sleeping in 
our houseand until they f oundanother saf erplace to go. Som y m om  would be hiding people 

continuously and shewas kind of  part of theunderground. Sothere was af e
e l i n g of  f ea r .
 
>> Bill Benson:  In May 1940,eight months af ter Germ any attackedPoland beganW orldW ar II they 

invaded the low countries, which are Belgium , the Netherlandsand France,and as you started to tell 

us, yourf ather left to join the British Arm y just bef ore the Germ ans invaded Belgium. T ellus about 

your f ather's leaving and what he did.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Okay.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Knowi ng this, you wouldn'tbe able to tellm ostof  ituntil later because you didn't 

know.
 
>> Jo sie  T rau m :  Ye s, of  co
urse, because I learnedmuch of this later on.
 
W hen I  wa s  o l de r .
 
My dad and his brother, they were both tailors, by the way.  My dad's brother, UncleBen, was alsoa 

tailor and they both decided to jointhe British Arm y.  Sothey actually went onone of th
e l as t  b oa ts 

that crossedthe channel and was able to getto England. This was in 1940.  I was 13 months old.  

Andm y dad and hisbrother gottoEnglandand there they evaluated these two men who cam e in and 

wanted to join theBritish Arm y, what could they do, they were tailors.  So they evaluated them and 

placed them both inafactory m aking British uniform s.  And that wasthebestplace they could be.  

Actually, Englandhad what they called 
--
 
they had a Polish contingentof  the British Arm y, and m y 
dad 
and his brother cam eunder thatheading. T hey were part of the Polish contingent,apart of the 

8

B ri t i s h  Army.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your m om  know what happenedtohim once he departed and headedfor the 
coast and off to England?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Shedid no
t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  She did not.
 
>> Josie T raum : W e knew 
--
 
m y aunt told uslater, m y m om  knew thatm any ships that wer e crossing 
the channel were bombed and torpedoed, and she really never knew whether he ever got to England 

or not.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So here you arealone, you and your mom.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid she do?
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, we stayed in ourapartm ent. She was ver y active in the underground hiding 

people, and we actually li ved with m y m aternal grandparents,herparents lived with us.  We were all 

together. And pretty much survived the way we were.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that would continue 
--
 
you would live in Brussels under Nazi occupation until 
1942 when your mother m ade theprof ound decision to send you into hiding. Tell us whatyou can 

about theevents that led up to her making that decision andthen what shedid to then send you off to 

saf ekeeping, but away f rom  her.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Okay.  I think people realized the danger was becom ing more andm ore im m inen
t  in  
Belgium . Germans, Nazi officers were walki ng up anddown the streets.T hey were arresting people, 

and shem adethe decision to put me into hiding.  Now, she
-
because she was in touch withthe 
underground andpartof  the underground, she had connections, and soone day two strange wom en 

--
 
I was three years old in 1942. T wo strangewom en cam etopick me up and they actually tookm e 
away and m y m otherwas not allowed to know where I was going.  T hey f iguredthat when the 

9 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
G e rm an s cam e t o a rrest  Je ws,  t h
ey would torture them  tofind out where the rest of their fam ily was.  
And so they never told parents where they were hiding the children. T o me this isalmost beyond 
com prehension, having my own children and grandchildren 
--
 
I can't im aginem aking that d
ecision, 
but sheobviously did it because she wantedm eto be safe. But asI said, shedidn't know where I 

was going.  T wo wom en cam e to pickme upandthey took me to avil lage in Belgium , which is called 

Bruges, which is full of convents andfull of  canals.  It's beautiful. They took me to this convent where 

there were many, many children.  Notnecessarily Je wish children.  I foundoutaf ter the war thatthere 

were three other Jewish children there, and so thef our of us were there, but there were many 
other 

children there. It was m ore like anorphanage.  In thosedays, when people couldn't carefor their 

children, it was wartim e, f ood was very m eager, people wouldput their children inanorphanage.  

And whenthey were able to and becam em ore stable, they would be ableto take 
--
 
pick the children 
up. SoI was in anorphanage 
--
 

>> Bill Benson:  Before we go on with you telling us about the orphanage, let me ask just a couple of 

questions about yourmother going intothatperiod. And your grandparents.  You had been living with 

your grandparents. W hat was going onfor them at that time?
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, at thattim e m y mother 
--
 
m y grandm other worked as a volunteer really f or the 
--
 
what we call theBurying Society, when a Jewish person dies, there's a special ritualof  a burial.  
You watch over the body, you wash the body.  My grandmother was doing that indiff erentplaces.  

My grandfather was ascholar anda Rabbi. So they went on with their business really.  Andm y m om , 

I was at hom e with m y m om . W ehardly ever went out.W e were ver y m uch inhiding, living in an 

attic apartm ent, andthat's where we were.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know how she was able tof eed you,m akeendsm eet?
 
>> Josie T raum :  My grandmother, who workedfor this Jewish organization would bring food to the 

house.  First of all,food was ra
tioned
 
in Belgium . W e had very m eager possibility of  getting f ood in 

10 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y
 
NO T  A V E RB AT I M R E CO RD
 
 
general, butm y grandm other would often bring m ilk and breadandcertain foodsf rom  where she was 
wo r k i n g.
 
>> B ill B
enson:  If  youhadbecome sick or anything like that, you couldn't getaccess tohealthcare?
 
>> Josie T raum :  No.T he clinicsf or childrenwere closed to Jews.  So I really couldn't getany care.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Although you were so young while you were with yo ur m other, you've toldm ethat 

you do have somef leeting mem ories.T here's one in particular, if  I rem ember correctly, you're on a 

bus with your m other.  W ill you share that?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yeah.  You always get thatstory f rom me.
 
It's very hard
 
t o  t e ll.
 
My m om  and I were on a bus together andaNazi off icer cam e up. You know, the Nazis would come 

andapproach peopleand askf or the identitycard. T he identity card was, of course,m arked if  you 

were a Jew, there was a gigantic J on it. T here was nom istaking it. You were a Jew.  Andboth m y 

m other andI had identity cards. W e got on abus to go som ewhere. I can't remem bernow where, 

but I was sitting in the last row.  It was actually not a bus. It was a tram.  In Belgium they used tram s, 

yo
u know, by electricity, and we sat inthe last row and aGermanofficer got on to the tram andasked 
for everybody's identity card.  He was going f rom  row to row to row.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he was getting close toyour m om?
 
>> Josie T raum :  He was getting
 
closeto us andm y m om  was really shaking.  Ididn't understand 
wh y.  I was three years old. And she was really shaking.  And they were going from  row 
--
 
he was 
going f rom  row to row and for som e reason he got to the last row, turned around and gotoff the bus.  

And I remem berm y mother just breathing a sigh of relief . I didn't know why she was scared.  Ihad 

no idea. But, you know, in retrospect, looking at it now, I realize what was going on insideher.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Afew m oments ago, Josie, you were telling us how incomprehensible it is to think of  

sending your child intohiding as amother and a parent.  Has yourmom  spoken of what it was likef or 

11 
 
RO UG H DR AF T  CO P Y

her when she sent you off with those 
--
 
>> Josie T raum :  Shehas. And I think I really think that's
 
one of the hardest things that she's ever 
done.  Andone of thebravest things.  Imean, I'm alive today because of her.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.  And once she did that and you wenttothis convent, you would stay at 
this conventf or abouta year.
 
>> 
Josie T raum :  I stayed therefor six m onths.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Six months. T ell us what you know about your time.  Andas you said itwas reall y an 

orphanage and you'rethere as oneof  the small num berof  Jewish children inthis orphanage. W hat 

do you know of what that was likef or you?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Form e, first of all, it was run by nuns, and these nuns were ver y, ver y str ict.
 
I hear you all sm iling.
 
But notbecauseI was Jewish.  T hey were stri ct toall the kids.  You know, I was three years old and
 
I 
think all I wanted was to be held, to be hugged.  Andthey just didn'tdo that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that they look like nunsf rom "T he Sound of Music," but not like that, 

r i gh t ?
 
>> Josie T raum :  No,they didn't sing.
 
[Laughter]
 
But they wore these very, ver y stiff  habits.  Do you know these 
--
 
really like " T he Sound ofMusic,"  
ver y tight.  No wonder they were strict.  T hey m usthave been uptight.  And I was ver y scar ed. I was 

crying a lot.  Iused to be a very f ussy eater. W hatever littlef ood
 
I had, I was ver y f ussy and I would 
cry.  So I was probably notthe easiest childto handle,but obviously I just wanted som ehugging f rom  

t h em .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was not whatthey did?
 
>> Josie T raum : T hatwas not apossibility.  T hat was not an
 
o pt i o n.

>> Bill Benson: W hile you were there, you were in hiding, did 
--
 
Ithink that's when you had to change 
your name?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes,I did. T he governm ent actually changedm y nam e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he resistance?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes. My f irst name remained the sam e, I was Josiane, but instead of  Aizenberg, 

they gave m e a Dutchname or a Flem ish nam e, which was Van Bergh. W hich is a very D utchnam e. 

So I came with that nam e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that was a signif icant change to give you 
that nam e?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  From that tim e in the convent, as you said, you went hugged or held, whatdo you 

think them ost signif icant impacton youpersonally was f rom  being in the conventfor thatperiod of  

t im e ?
 
>> Josie T raum : 
 
T he im pact onm e?
 
>> Bill Benson:  On you.
 
>> Josie T raum : W ell, I think I hadm ore of an im pactbefore going into the convent, asfaras having 

a very nurturing and loving hom e.  My grandm other was ver y, ver y nurturing and loving and hugging 

and so was m y m om , so I always attributethosef irst three years, especially having, you know, 

studied childdevelopment, thosef irst three years of  nurturing and care taking are so crucial for a 

child's growing andf or feeling comf ortable,and I really attributedto
 
my mom and tomy grandmom.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you had thatfoundation going into what you would then live threw f or the next 

several years.
 
>> Josie T raum : T hey say asf ar as child developm ent is concerned, thosefirst three years are so 

crucial.  And itdoesn't have tobea parent.  It's a caretakeror just isloving and gi ving, and I had that.  

And luckily that was kind of afoundationform e.  Ididn'thave it inthe convent.

>> Bill Benson:  Right. At som e point, Josie, the nunsm adethe decision to move you outof there 
and send you som ewhere else. W hat do you know about thatdecision?
 
>> Josie T raum :  My understanding is, you know, f irst of all, I wantyou to realize, in Belgium , and 

m any European countries, if  you were a Christian andhiding a Jew and if a Germ anf ound you they 

would just shoot you,no questions asked. So these nuns,however strict they were with me, they 

saved m y lif e. T hey took risks. T hey risked their lives.  T hey couldhave been shot.T heyfound out 

thatthe Nazis were goi ng to com eand arrestor deport or takeaway thefour Jewish children.  And 

when theyf ound that out, apparently, by night they sm uggledm eout of  the conventback to Brussels, 

which is where I'm originally f rom and where I was born.  Andthey placedme w
it h  a  Ch ris t ia n f a m ily,  
the Debrackelaers, who you saw on the slides.  So the nuns,they were lifesaving.  And they saved 

thefour of us. T hey placedus all indiff erenthomes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And at that time did your m other know what had happenedto you,that you had been 

m oved?
 

>> Josie T raum :  She had no idea.
 
In them eantim e, shehad been arrested.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Okay.  My m om and her parents were deported.  You know, there were many 

wonderful people in Belgium,
 
people who really risked their lives, butthere were many people who 
informedon Jews, becausethe Germ ans gotpaid. They paid theseinformers.  So although many 

Christian people helped me and saved m y life, there were many people who did other things.  
F o r 

instance, oneof  our neighbors inf ormedonmy m om ,and that's how m y m om ,the Germans realized 

where she was livin g and they came to deport her. And they arrested herand my grandparents. And 

indeed they beat her.  And tof ind out where the restof thefam ily was, she really couldn't tell them  

because she didn't know.

>> Bill Benson:  And Iknow we'l l hear a littlem oreaboutthat in a little bit, Josie. So youmoved in 
with the Debrackelaer fam ily and you would live with them  until Belgium  was liberatedby the allies in 

September 1944. T ellus about the Debrackelaers and what your life was like in hiding with them .
 
>> Josie T raum : T heDebrackelaers obviously were wonderf ul people to take me in, risk their lives.  

T hey hada little girl my age and we pretty much played together most of the day, but I was ver y m uch 

in hiding. W ehardly left the apartm ent.  Mr.Debrackelaer, thef ather, was
 
ver y active in the 
underground, trying to sabotage things inorder to help Jews and tokind of sabotage whatwas 

happening with the Germ ans.  He was of tentakenoutf or interrogation andhemust have been 

beaten, because he would come back at night black and blue. Buthe never told onm e.A really 

gre a t... 
 
I ' m  s o rry.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkpeople understand this is ver y diff icultto do, Josie, very diff icult.
 
So he is working in the resistance.  He's got you inhiding.  He's gotaf am ily.  I was struck by you 

telling m eone time that

becausefood was rationed and hard to get, they had rationsfor a fam ily of 
f r ee .
 
>> Josie T raum :  I was there illegally. W hatever was rationed, they would share with m e.  I was one 

of  thefam ily.  I wasf ed and I was kept safe.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know
-
knowing you were there illegally and a f ourth m outh to feed in that 
sense, do you know if neighbors around them  knew you were there and if  they would say, so who is 

thisf ourth person living over there with the Debra

>> Josie T raum :  Youknow, I don't know.  And Ineverf oundout. So Idon't know.  Because I really 

hardly ever went out.  And I was not schoolage so I did not go to school.

wi lling to say a little about that?

there was this whole network in the underground.  Ifyou were

spoiled rotten.

He's a very quiet

he was ver y quiet, m eekm an, andapparently got a specialm edalforkilling

it was wonderf ul being

>> Bill Benson:  Did you know you were Jewi sh when you went to your aunt's? 
 
You're still ver y 
young.
 
>> Josie T raum :  I'm  very young.  I don'tthink I knew what Jewish was.  I had no idea. W henI went 

to the convent, youask a three

old, what is a Jew, and I certainly didn't know.  And Idon't

I 
was not aware of  it.  You

of

>> Josie T raum :  Ormy father.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Or your father. W hat was it likef or your aunt to sort of  redo youm ean their lif e? T he 

war is going on elsewhere and Europe, you're liberated in Belgium ,but it's still going on. Do you 

rem em ber or know anything abouthow they were trying to resume a lif e?
 
>> Josie T raum : T hey had a store inf ront of theapartm ent. Very often when you'rea shopkeeper, 

you have a store the apartment is behindtheshop.  My auntand her husband rana leather goods 

store. They had purses, handbags, leather coats,and sothey resum ed their lif e by workin g.  By 

m aking a living, getting food, buying things and trying to normalize their lif easm uch aspossible.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So April 1945,the war endsoff icially in May of  1945.  Yourm other is liberated in 

April of  '45 in whatm ust have seemed to all to be am iracle.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other survives and essentially shows up. Tell us about that.
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m otherhad beendeported to Auschwitz and she endured and survi ved 

Auschwitz.  M y grandfatherdiedona cattle car on the way to Auschwit z.  My grandmother, who was 

taken with m y m otherdied very soon. W henyou got to Auschwitz, t hey hada selection where they 

put thehealthier younger people in one lineand theolderfolks, although my grandm otherm usthave 

been 50, they putthem onanother line.  Because it was a labor camp in Auschwitz, which was the 

canal, so they selected m y m other to work in the labor cam p.  She wanted to stay with herm other, 

but theGermans really swiped her and said, you go where you're told.  So she actually never saw her 

m other again.  So m ym other was liberated by the Russians, takenby the Red
 
Cross eventually.  She 
was pretty sick.  Shehad typhus andm eningitis, and eventually theRed Cross brought her back to

Belgium . And thef irst place she went was her sister's apartm ent. She knocked on the door and 
there I was.
 
So it was quite a reunion
. 

>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember that?
 
>> Josie T raum :  I remem ber seeing her,butm y m other hasf illedme in with details because I was 

six years old and Idon't rememberm any of those details.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One ofthe details that yourm other has shared, can we talk about that?
 
>> Josie T raum :  I knew you were going to bring it up.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you want todo it or do you want me to do it?
 
>> Josie T raum :  I cando it. I'll probably cry, but I can do it.
 
My m other tellsm e 
--
 
because many of  thesethings I don't rem em ber.  I was so young.  But my 
m other tells m e whenshe cam e back and when we were reunited,when I would go to sleep at night,I 

would tie m y nightgown to hers because I was so af raid to loseheragain.  Somy m other told me 

th a t.
  
Idon't rem em ber doing that,but she tells m ethat and itmakes m e cry ever y tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hanks for telling it anyway.  I think it's so powerf ulfor you to do that.
 
Soon af ter your m other's liberation, which was  in April, once she showed up at
 
your aunt'shouse, she 
would thentake you and the two of you would move, I think, by June had gone toherown home.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthis point you still don't know anything about your father.
 
>> Josie T raum :  No.Althoughactually thewar in '45, he did startcorresponding with us.  My dad, 

thehouse he was livin g in London was bombed andhe was actually in ahospital f or two years.  He 

was injured pretty badly, and sohe came back in '46.  I was seven years old.  I really didn'
t r e m em be r  
him ,becausehe was 13 months old when heleft. So I remember going to the boat, tothe port, the 

city where theboats com e in, and I remem ber m y m om  saying tom e, we went to greet theboat, and

m ake, you know, af am ily who hadn't been togetherfor many years and all of a sudden you addeach 

individual and it's difficult.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Not just add each individual in a surprise way, not knowing that they were even alive.  

Bef ore you were reunited with your father in 1946 when yourm otherand youmovedtoherown place 

in June of 1945,af ter what she hadbeen through at Auschwit z and all the losses shehadsuff ered, 

what do you know about what that tim e was likef or your mother and thereforefor you in trying to 

rebuild a life again without yourf atherat that tim e?
 
W hat was that like in those imm ediatepost

war m onths really?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Ithink it was really diff icultfor m y m other. I rem em berher inBelgium  right af terthe 

war and some years later, even the UnitedStates,her waking up during the night and scream ing, 

having nightm ares. And I didn'tunderstand why.  I mean, I was only a kid. And m yself , I had gone 

throug
h traumatic tim es, but it was hardfor my m other,because she had gonethroughhell.  You 
know, having seen her parents die,m easured, so it was a 
--
 
murdered, so it was a pretty hard tim e.  It 
was hard f or m y m om .
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were six.  So time to start going to school.
 
>> Josie T raum :  I started school, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas that likefor you, to all of a sudden, all you had beenthrough, inhiding, lost 

your parentsand now they're back.  Yourdad is notback yet. And now you're ba

>> Josie T raum : T hat's right.  And I never wa s in school to begin with.  Inever knew what school was 

like, so Ithink it was very nice being with kids, being able to socialize and interact and learning and 

going to school.

about that three
-
year period living in Belgium  and resum ing a lif eand their thoughts anddecisions to 
theextent you know about imm igrating to the UnitedStates.
 
>> Josie T raum :  My parents,because m y mom had beenthroughso much,andm y dadequally in 
his own wa y, they really wanted to leave Europe and wanted to come tothe
 
United States,so they 
appliedf orpapers, gotVisas eventually and we cam e to the UnitedStatesto really start a new lif e in 

1949.
 
>> Bill Benson: W as there a reason that it took three years?
 
>> Josie T raum :  It took that long on the waiting list.
 
>> B
ill Benson:  On the waiting list, in order to get their Visas andbe able to com e.
 
>> Josie T raum : T hebureaucracy andpaper work took that longf or us to wait.  And m yf ather and 

m y m om  and I cam eto the United Statesalong with his brother, theone who went to England with 

him  who survived.  And he and his wif e and two daughters also cam eto 
--
 
we all came together.  And 
they settled in New York and we settled in New Jerse y.
 
>> Bill Benson: What about your mother's two sisters?  My.
 
>> Josie T raum :  My m om 's two sisters, f irstof all, m y mom 's older sister went to Israel with her three 

boys.  And m y mom 'syounger sister came to the United Statesandsettled in New York.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But didn't come at the sam etim e.
 
>> Josie T raum :  No, she also had to apply for papers individually.  It was just a very long pr ocess.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So what do you know aboutwhat it was like f or your parents and you to arri ve now in 

a new country, 1949 and start their life here?W hat was that likefor them?
 
>> J o s i e  T
raum : W ell, I think it was ver y diff icult. W eactually settled in New Jersey, in North New 
Jersey, becausem y mom  had an aunt there,and you settle where you have a relative where you can 

have some connection.  So we settleduntilmy parentsf ound an apartm ent, they found jobs in the 

garm ent industry and Ithinkfor m y parents they settled into work and into living pretty soon af ter.  

22

And we settled in a com munity in North New Jersey where there were m any survi vors who came to 
settle. I think it was very
 
dif f icult to settle, but m y parents som uch wanted to be Am ericans. T hey 
right awa y went to school, started learning English and thehistory, because they wanted to become 

citizens.  In those days you have toanswer alot of  questions.  So they did.  And
 
I don't m ean they 
answered questions then, they didn't, but they went to school andthey were so anxious tobecom e 

Am ericans.  Infact, when I would come home f rom  school, I would only speak English to them . W e 

stopped speaking. T hey would speak Yiddish
 
athom eor French, and I wouldalways speak English 
to them because they so much wanted to speak English.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that was a choice, you will  speak English andonly English here.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou left Belgium I think you were in third or fourth grade, but when you cam e 

here they put you inf irst grade. Tell us about that.
 
>> Josie T raum : T hey put me inf irst grade not because of m y height, because I was never tall. T hey 

put m e in f irst grade because I didn't 
speakone word of  English andthey thought if  you want to speak 
English you have to start atthe beginning, so they put me inf irst grade. I stayedthere about two 

weeks and then they put m e in second grade.
 
>> Bill Benson: T wo weeks.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Andon and onuntil If inally caught up. I graduated on time elem entary school. And 

this was in North New Jersey.  And, you know, I f eltokay.
 
>> Bill Benson: T here were som e rough momentsfor you in thatearly stage, andthe transition was 

noteasy for you, right?
 
>> Josie T raum : T hesecond day I was in elem entary school, a gang of  girls waitedf orme outside 

andbeatm eup. And I was pretty scared.  I wenthom eand cried and m y mom  went the next

it's because they thought I was Germ an.  Now, I don'tthink kids atthat age knew the difference,but 
obviously I was different and they ganged uponm e. I was hurt.  But it didn't happenanymore. 
 
T h e y

Josie, you lost your gr andparents at Auschwi tz. W hat about the rest of  your extendedf am ily?  How 

m any survived and how m any did not to your knowledge?

Do we have some more questions?

>> Bill Benson: T hat's a great question. I think Josie is going to end the program in af ew m inutes 

with a direct response to that. So we'll get an answer to that.
 
>> Josie T raum :  Great question.
 
>> Bill Benson: We have a questionhereand one in theback.
 
>> T hank you, again, Josie, for a beautif ul testim ony.  I'm  curious about the D

have you kept in touch?  Do you know anything about them ? Itm ust have been very dif f icultf or 

them , like youhad said, to save you.  Do youhave any inf ormation about them?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Question for thef olks in the back, in case you didn'thear, what Josie knows about 

the Debrackelaers and what becam e of them andother thoughtsabout them .
 
>> Josie T raum :  My parents,until we lef tBelgium  in 1949, we were  in contact with them. But then it 

stopped.  And whenmy husband and I wentback to Belgium in 1989 I tried tof indthem . Apparently 

they had all died, including the young daughter.  So I really neverf ound out any more inform ation.  

Andfor thatm atter, I tried tof ind out theorder of  thenuns who hidme, because I wantthem  to be 

recognized.  And I've written tothe French governm ent and apparently the order is no longer in

becom esone. So they're trying to f ind out, but I have notbeen successf ul in f inding out.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have a questiontowards theback.
 
>> T hank youf or sharing your story.  M y question to you is what kinds of truth and reconciliation 

m easures have been takentoday in term sof between the Jewish people 
and the Germ ans and how 
is thehealing process taking place to 
--
 
I'm not going to say rem ove the reality of  whathappened, but 
to not have that wall, between, say, if  youm eet som eone on the street that is German?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Josie,is that something
 
you feel comf ortableanswering?
 
>> Josie T raum :  Youknow, f irst of all, I personally feel that you can't blame the childrenfor what the 

grandparents did or the parentsfor thatm atter.  Inf act, Idon't know if  you realize this, but in the

T his is written by aLutheranm inister.  He was ver y, at the beginning, very pro
-
Hitler, because Hitler 
prom isedm arvelous things.  T hen
 
whathe saw what Hitler was doing, he becam e very m uch anti
-
Hitler andhe was actually in prison.  And hewrote... 
 
" First I cam efor the socialists.  I did not speak outbecause I was not a socialist. T hen they camef or 

the tradeunionists. I did not speak out,because I was not a trade unionist. Then they cam efor the 

Jews.  I did not speak out becauseI was nota Jew.
 
T hen they cam efor me.  And there was no one left to speakfor me.  "
 
T his tom e is so powerful.  Youhave to speak outfor yourf ellow hum an being.  If  you seeinjustices 

or peoplem istreating other people, don't justbe quietand ignore it.You've got to say something.  

And in today's world, i n schools Iunderstand there'sa lot of bullying.  You have to speakout andhelp 

protect the
se people. It is so important.  Justbecause you don't have the right nam e on your 

sneakers or your jacket doesn'tm ean youhave to betreateddiff erently.  You have to speak outfor 

your f ellow hum an being.
 
T hank you.
