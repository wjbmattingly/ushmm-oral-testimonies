A: I hope you don™t mind I say

were five children, so th
ey all spoke right away E
nglish, German, French and 
Polish. The boys were learning Russian, but
 the Œ the girls, three girls were not 
learning Russian. They were not allowed ow
n Œ to speak Russian at home, because 
Poland
 was occupied . So, it was like resentment. But later on, of course, she 
learned Russian. And she understood Ita
lian and she understood Sp anish. From 
knowing those languages, when  we came to 
America
 th ey often ask her wh en she 
was in a hospital, to be translator for 
the people that they couldn™t communicate 
with, you know, so th-they could 
[indecipherable] 
Q: So sh e Œ so she learned this Œ 
A: At home. 
Q: Œ at home, and at home wa
s where? Where was her home? 
A: Th-The home was in 
[indecipherable]
 and th is was 
Ru-Rudakow
(ph). It was 
very large estate, becau se it was 12,000 he
ctares. It was a very large estate over 
there. A lot of people were coming there. 
There was a big house, of course. It used 
to be this was 
Horvath™s
(ph) property, actually. My grandfather married a 
Horvath
 girl. They were of Hung
arian origin. And not fu Œ far from there, th ey had 
a beautiful palace actually. My mother said
 everything was carved over there. It 
was right on the river

Q: So it was Œ she was Œ a-and came from a landed gentry family. 
A: Oh yeah, she was very gentry . 

Q: Very gentry. 
A: You see, I found out here in 
America
 that when there were
 balls in Œ they  had 
apartment houses they owned in 
Kiev
, and they ha Œ owned a place i-in 
Minsk
. 
And this one woman here, she ma
rried later the richest man in 
Poland
, 
Boldanovitch
(ph), and they were talking about
 their childhood. And she said 
[indecipherable]
 wh enever you came with your sist
er to the dance, all the men 
were bending in half to dance with you
, because everybody kne
w your money. My 
mother told me that each
 one of th em had hundred
 thousand rubles put in 
Kiev
 in 
the bank as dowry, and it was in Œ it was in gold, you know. It was a lot of money 
too, but it wasn™t in 
Switzerland [indecipherable] 
the money. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But the 
[indecipherable]
 grandfather put it in ther
e, and the revolution came 
and that was the end of the gold. 

Q: Oh dear, oh Œ so, in othe
r words, that way of life 
that she was born into all 
changed with World War I and 
th e end of th e revolution.

Bolshevik
 revolution.

A: You see, my mother always thought 
they had several cars over there, and one 
car was 
Minerva
 called. And when I came to 
America
 I work with
 very rich 
people in the brokerage, all of them are 
millionaires, and one I told him that my 
mo ther always talk about 
Minerva
, oh it was car made in 
Switzerland
, it was 
25,000 in  
America
 before the first World War. 
Q: Oh my  gosh. 
Oh my gosh.  
A: So you know, from that I 
got what they had because I 
only saw pictures of that 
place when I was small. But y-you know, th
ey never bragged, 
they never bragged 
about anything and an ything. They were t Œ 
we were told from ch
ildhood to be very 
helpful to people, to be nice to people, to
 be polite to every
body. If anybody needs 
help, you have to help them and everyt
hing. And then Œ then in life I learned 
something else too, that you have to keep 
your ground, and not 
let your people, you 
know step over you. Becau
se some people, they 
[indecipherable]
 softness.  
Q: That™s right. 
A: And Œ and th ey try to take
 advantage of you, but Œ a-
and that was life. But they 
ni Œ I was never told you know, something 
like this. There used to be a crazy man 
that used to come to our house and he wa
s eating in  the kitchen and ev erything, and 
my father sat and talked always with him.
 Eventually, during the war he attacked a 
local 
[indecipherable]
 killed him. He Œ he was crazy, but my father used to spend

time even with him wh
en he came, wanted to talk. 
Well, talk to the person, you 
know. 
Q: Yeah. So , did your mo th
er, when the revolution happened, this is, you know, 
several years before your birth, was sh
e already married, was she already living 
there Œ 

A: They got married Œ I don™t know on wh
at day they  got marr
ied exactly, but they 
got married, and they lived still in 
Rudakow
(ph). And in 
Ruda ko w
(ph) th ere was 
German army stationed over there. This
 was through first World War. And what 
happened was that ev
entually the German army we
nt communistic, and the other 
side was communistic, and they  all dropped 
their rifles and they said, why are we 
fighting? And th e Germans dress my  mo ther 
and my father as German soldiers and 
put them on the train to evacuate th
at, because they started killing all the 
[indecipherable]
 over there already, and especia
lly the bourgeois, you know. So 
the Germans evacuated them, a
nd my father said that th
e Russians were shooting at 
that German in train, and the machin
ists run away. And my  grandfather was 
build ing 
Trans-Siberian
 railroad in 
Russia
, and my father tr
aveled the loco Œ 
locomotive, so my fath
er went and he was running the train to 
Poland
 because they 
had nobody to run th e train, they didn™t kno
w how to operate it. 
And my father said 
he was lucky that when he cam
e to the Polish border Œ already 
Poland
 had a

border, they  stopped them. And they didn
™t like people coming from the east, but 
my father ask, who is the commanding o
fficer there? And he Œ my father knew him 
when he said, tell him that it™s 
me. So they le
t them go into 
Poland
, because they  
could have turned  them in, and there 
was big trouble, you know, people moving 
there and back. 

Q: So your mother™s estate
 and where she married your father was in what™s today 
Belarus
? It was a Œ 
A: It Œ it Œ it was 
Belarus - Minsk
, you know, there. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But you didn™t tell 
my  mo ther, you see, we could have come to 
America
, 
clearly, because she was born in 
Russia
. But Americans would have given her a 
Russian visa right away to come to 
America
, because there was no quota number 
from 
Russia
, but my mother wouldn™t let 
be put that she was born in 
Russia
, 
because may be a Russian. So sh
e refused to do it, and she 
said that she was born in 
Rudakow
(ph),
 Poland
. I can show her passport to you Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ even, I have her passport. Because 
we resented Œ you see, we considered 
Russia
 inhuman land, because it™s Œ the minu
te you cross Œ I am not talking about 
the Russian people, but the land is inhuma
n. When  you go in  there and you see, 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

10
when you cross 
Ural
 mountains, you go fo r days and 
days, every now and th en you 
see some sediment, they Œ 
where did they put coal, or something. And th ere™s 
nothing but rivers, forests, everything™s 
empty. People were all walk ing with 
mosquito nets on their face, millio n of mo
squitos. Where they 
deported us there 
was a forest, we were asking Russians, how
 far does the forest go? Nobody knew. 
They just didn™t know what it was, and th
ey  didn™t know mu ch about the world. In 
that village a lot of people never saw a pl
ane. Some of them used to go to Œ to 
deliver, you know, by truck something, so
 they knew Œ they saw trains, but the 
children didn™t see trains.  
Q: So this is Œ you™re talki
ng ab out deep into
 the heart of 
Siberia
. 
A: 
Si-Siberia
, yeah. 
Q: And we™ll get to that part of your st
ory when Œ wh en  you en
d up there with your 
family. I w ant to establish now, get Œ get a 
sense a little bit of your
 early life, and of 
the family that you were born into, both on 
the mother™s side a
nd on your father™s 
side.  

A: No, because wh-when my father and my
 grandfather was dead already, because 
he was building 
Trans-Siberian 
railroad, and he had ulcers operation in 
Mo scow
, 
and he went for recovery to 
Ya lta
, and he™s buried in 
Yalta
 actually, he died over 
there. And Œ

11
Q: Mm-hm. That would have been  wh at year? 
A: I could not tell you. 

Q: 1890s though, or Œ 
A: It™s something Œ 18 so
mething you know. My fath
er was young still, it was 
before he met my mother, so he was y
oung man. And m-m Œ well, with my  mo  Œ 
family, my  grandfather was Œ everything 
[indeciphera b le]
 he was a banker, he was 
a shipbuilder, he was 
organiza tor
(ph) of Polish 
zi-ziemianin
. 
Zi e m i a n i n
 means 
people who possess land, you know Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ because Œ 
Q: Landowners. 
A: Landowner. Because you have to realize th at in 
Poland
, people look down on 
being a trader, on being something at your
 business like this. 
They like to have 
ownership and they  were 
[indecipherable]
 you know, this was the part of people, 
they took part in the wars. 
The peasants didn™t have to fight, but the Polish peasants 
were not slaves, but they didn™t have to
 fight. And that™s why so many Jews, cause 
[indecipherable]
 he had the girlfriend Jewish, and they  brought a lot of Jewish 
people, and they open up 
Poland
 to the Jews, because th
ey needed people in 
busin ess and in everything, and a lot of Jewish people came to 
Poland
. Actually, a 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
12
maso n  sh owed  me in  
America
 papers the Jews used to
, 1600, how to
 come to 
Poland
. It was shown that there was nothing,
 no to wn s or nothing. And a lot of 
Jews were immigrating to 
Poland
, but Œ 
Q: You™re talking several hundred years ago.  
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And they  were coming in, you know, 
K - Ka zim i er z W i elki
. He had the 
stairka
(ph). 
Q: Casti Œ so you™re talking about 
Casimir
 the Great? 
Casimir
(ph) the Œ yeah . 
A: Yeah, yeah, this is  long ago, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And you see, I studied very little Polish 
history, I know, but the Jewish people 
were welcome in 
Poland
 because you know, some
 people say, well, you 
persecuted us. I said, why did you come? 
No body ask you. You were invited to 
come, but surely, to open the trade. And Œ a
nd that was it. Very often we were told 
by Jewish people even  in 
Wilno
, you own the street, 
we own th e houses, you 
know, so that was the Œ all the businesses, 
if you went to stores or something, like 
we used to go and buy clothe
s, and everything was in Œ mo st in Jewish stores, you 
know. Later on they  started making co operatives in 
Poland
, so Œ like we had to sell 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
13
a cow or a horse or a grain; everything w
ill being always sold to
 Jewish people. But 
generally before the war, they started ma
king trading organiza
tion, and you know, 
the Œ and that was different. But the Œ bu
t the thing was, you know, who knows? 
By now everybody™s so mixed up over ther
e, nobody knows who™s who. Like you 
knew history. 
Q: Right. 

A: My Œ my  Œ I think it was my  grandfathe
r™s father, he was punished by the tsar 
for rebelling against the tsar. So he was sent for 12 years of 
ka to rg a
(ph). 
Kato rga
(ph), I don™t know what Œ you know what 
ka torg a
(ph) is? 
Q: Yeah, go Œ it™s Œ it™s 
[indecipherable]
 
A: He was chained to a wheelbarrow for 12
 years in a mine. And when they release 
him, he was sent Œ he wasn™t allowed to return to 
Poland
, so he went to 
Kaupas
(ph). And my father to
ld me that he married a Œ this miserable 
harrick
(ph), 
wh-who was a Tartar or somethi
ng like this, you know, from there. 
[indecipherable]
 supposedly, who™s princess or so
mething, because he had money 
you know, when  he was released alre
ady. And then he came back to 
Poland
, and 
they Œ I had very  dark comp lexi
on. My father said that this
 is he Œ that he is dark 
complexion, I, my siste
r, from that Œ from her. And they called me in 
Poland
, 

Togo
(ph), my  grandfather called me 
Togo
(ph) because he knew a Japanese 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

14
admiral, an d it was 
Tojo
(ph). And he said because I had slanted eyes. And my  
experience in life was, when I was in
 American army, they send me to 
To kyo
 first. 
And when I was in 
Tokyo
 I went to Japanese stores, 
and the Japanese right away 
puts chairs for me in the store, brings th
e tea or something to  drink. I said, why do 
you do it? Because you™re no gook, you™re 
not a foreigner. I said
, why? Your eyes. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And the Japanese saw it right away, th
ey  have Œ you slanted eyes, and they  
treated me very differently 
from Americans. And when I to
ld them that I™m Polish, 
well, they loved Polish people because Po
lish people hated the Russians. And this 
was after th e Korean war, and you know, 
when  Ru ssians marched and took kore Œ 
up north, 
Japan
, well they never releas
ed it, and they said 
that was the reason the 
Japanese surrendered so  fast in second 
Wo rld War. It wasn™t only atomic weapons, 
but the Russians invaded already, 
Japa n
. And they were petrified that 
Russia 
will 
take all of 
Japa n
. And Japanese from first Wo
rld War, they hate them. 
Q: My goodness. All of Œ 

A: I 
[indecipherable]
 too mu ch . 
Q: No, no, but it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s so many thread
s, and they™re very interesting, all of 
them. But let™s go back to your father, and I 
want to just establish one thing; when 
you speak of the grandfather you knew, it™s 
your mother™s father, is that correct?

father. 
A: I only had a picture of him, but I 
don™t know him, I didn™t know him. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: He died when  my fath
er was young, you know. 
Q: So tell me Œ tell me about the 
Kiersnowski
 family, about your father™s side, and 
were they as Œ as wealthy as
 your mother™s side, or how Œ 
A: Well, 
Kiersnowski
, he Œ he Œ I™ll tell the story of 
Kiersnowski 
family was, 
there were a lot of 
[indecipherable]
 they were exceptionally
 wealthy, you know, 
for that family. And they used to se
nd, if somebody was in trouble, to 
Ox fo rd
 Un-
Un-Universities and everything. They were 
known, but they were all educated, and 
they were engineers, lawyer
s, everything, and they had lands, too, property land. In 
Druskieniki
, my father™s family hadvillas, qu
ite a number of villas over there. 
And they sold it, and for Œ for marks, a
nd the marks collapse. He didn™t sell it, he 
was mad at his Œ how brothers and sisters,
 that they sold it 
without his knowledge, 
my father said. He never wa nted to go and see, even.

barn only. And I told th e fellow turn around,
 I don™t want to see that. It brings too 
mu ch memory. I could go and see my  house. My 
Francesca 
was there, we were in 
Œ and the fellow says, well, it™
s a big barn. I says yeah, 
it™s a very big barn. And I 
always remember that barn, there was a bi
g storm before the war, and the wind tore 
the whole roof off, and we had to pay a lo
t of money to rebuild the roof on it, and 
the Polish govern ment put a new tax on us 
for the new roof, instead of giving us a 
tax reduction. 
Q: Yeah, insu
lt to injury. 
A: In-Insult to injury. 
Q: So Œ 
A: So Œ so my  father couldn™t go to  
schools. I told you, my father had 
wilchi

Russia 
Œ of 
Poland
 from 
Russia
 during th e geography lesson. And th at 
was the end of his education, they 
wouldn™t let him go, obviously . So  
he didn™t go. But if you talk Œ

They didn™t let him g Œ means Œ was he thrown out of 
school?

end of your education in 
Russia
, so you had to go somewhere overseas to study,

Trans-
Siberian 
railroad, my  fo Œ his g Œ my  grandfathe

bear in 
Russia
. And Œ and they  went up north,
 and his father said to him 
[indecipherable]
 you shoot, and you fall down. 
And Œ and the polar bear was 
coming at them. And then he shot, but my  fa
ther says, of course I missed, I hit him 
in the paw. And his father shot him in be
tween the eyes, and my father said that 
was my  end of hunting, because the bear 
sat down  and with the other paw grabbed 
snow and applied it to his forehead . And my
 father said, I woul
d never hunt again 
in my life. 
Q: Oh my goodness. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Oh my goodness.

Russia

villages. They used to have
 very, very long fields. So
 they were trying to make 
them square, you know, for them. And my
 mother said it wa
s so much trouble 
because they were comi
ng with the bags of gold, giving a bag of gold to give in this 
piece, not that piece and everything. And my
 mother said, I am not going to take 
any gold from you. He had to ev aluate wh
at the land was. You know, he knew the 
land. So it approximately the same field a
nd everything, but instead of him plowing 
two kilometers field, he wo
uld be plowing just few hu
ndred yards, you know. So  
he was doing Œ 
Q: So was this a certain kind 
of Polish refor Œ land reform? 
A: Yeah, Polish land reform.

about where you were born, the house you 
grew up in. What was the Œ what

how, how, and all our ducks starte
d running and the wolv es ran away. 
Q: Wow. 
A: But it was Œ it was Œ it was a beautiful 
life. You see, I was born with a heart. 
When  I went to school in 
Poland
, they put us in front 
of the machine when we 
were small, and they  looked at our lungs.
 A-And they saw my heart that I was in 
the wrong position, so I was not allowed to ri de on the bicycle, I was not allowed to 
take exercises. They said 
they Œ by 21 my heart will 
come to normal position, that 
it happens in children. We 
had a very good doctor, 
Sa lzman

care of 
Pilsudski

and behind th e horses in the winter, you 
know? 
Q: Cross country  skiing. 
A: And cross country sk i. We had the hills 
in fer Œ in back  of 
our property. I made 
the jumping thing and I used 
to jump. But I was very sm
all. I told you, I didn™t 
grow til I was fif Œ 16 - 17, and they call me 
[indeciphera ble]
 always in that I will 
never grow. My gran dfather was petrified. My father used to say, don™t wo rry, I 

was the same way. I was so sma ll and I was dark, and in school there was war in 
Abyssinia
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You know? 
Q: That™s right. 

A: And 
[indecipherable]
 was there, and they  carried me on the chairs in school 

and they  made me necklace that I am, you 
know, the king and ev
erything. And they 
pinch me while they carry me on the chair 
in schools. And my  mo ther finally took 

me and put me in a private school. But over
 there they told me that you never get 
tuberculosis, because you have very, ex
tremely large lungs, you know, in th at 
school. And Œ but I Œ I Œ I couldn™t do a lot of
 things that other children were doing. 
They  didn™t let me, you know, I stunk ex ercises.

Q: So you first Œ you were first in sc hool in a public school and then Œ 
A: Public school. 

Q: Œ and then changed to a private school. 
A: Well, my Œ I had appendicitis operation,
 and I was put on the stage in school 
during th e prayer and they told  nobody to
 push me or anything. And my  mo th er 
was coming to school, and there was a bunc
h of guys pulling me on the stairs by 
the legs. That did it, my mother took me 
out the school. And you see, I was fro m a 
farm, as my uncle, and I wasn™t living in 
Wilno
. So the people from 
Wilno
, the 
kids, they didn™t like me, tha Œ because 
I was from the country , you see? People are 
very clannish, immediately clannish. So 
they didn™t like me. 
And I remember o n e 
time, one guy was giving me so mu ch tr
ouble. And you know those furnaces to 
heat the house with Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ hermetic things they were bi
g iron things that you tied, and Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ and he started to Œ accusing me, a
nd I grabbed him by the neck  and I started 
hitting his head into that ir
on. Thank God there was some
 guy and they stopped me, 
I could have killed the guy. I was pre
tty strong you know  about things Œ 

Q: About how old were yo
u when that happened?

23
A: Ten. 
Q: And this was in public school? 

A: In public school, and th at™s my mo ther transferred me to 
[indecipherable]
 to 
public Œ to private school, and there were 
only 13 of us, and all 13 of us survived  

the war. Now only one lives in 
Warsaw
 and I am in 
America
. We talk every week 
with him, I talk with him. 

Q: Oh my  gosh. 
A: The other Œ the other 11 died  already. On e boy died  last year. 
Q: From that private school. But I want to
 stay with the pub
lic school. In that 
public school, were there any Jewish kids? 
A: Of course. 
Q: Okay , and Œ 

A: But Jewish kids were mostly i n  Jewish schools. 
Wilno
 had Jewish schools, 
Jewish universities, Jewish ev
erything. It was a big cultura
l center of Judaism. You 
know, in 
Poland
 there were what, three and a half millio n Jews, supposedly. That 
was 10 percent of Po lish population. So it 
was a great Œ what Œ what remain of 
Judaism. A lot of it was saved be Œ by being in 
Poland
. The only thing, the Jews 
didn™t understand wh at pogrom was.
 Pogrom was when
 the Cossacks from 
Ukraine
 were beating, but they were beati
ng everybody. They  were beating Jews, 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
24
they were beating us. There we
re Œ supposedly the tsar of 
Russia
 used Jews as tax 
collectors, so Russians woul
dn™t like the Jews for bein
g tax collectors. You know, 
there™s such a messy, this world always, th
e more you look at it, the worse it gets. 
That™s my opinion from my experience. 
Q: Well, when you were a kid going to  sch
ool, did all those Œ did those things play 
out in th e classroom, or play out outside of the classroom?  

A: Oh, we played outside. We we
re Œ no, but we 
had gymn astics in 
Poland
. Oh, 
there were lines to climb, y
ou know, there were a thing, you jump  over the horses Œ 
Q: Oh no, but what I me Œ what I meant by play out, I 
meant, did these issues of 
clannishes Œ clannishness and you know, ki
ds being either from wealthy parents or 
from poor parents, or Jewish kids, or Œ 

A: No, it wasn™t Œ it wasn™t that, it was Œ 
no, it wasn™t that. It was w h at region you 
come from. 

Q: Okay . 
A: You see, when they
 played, you know, in 
Wilno
 you saw there are courtyards. 
Q: Yes, right. 
A: So if a child from this courtyard were to
 come to play on th
is courtyard, they 
told him, go and play  in your own courtyard, leave our courty ard alone. People are 

so clannish that Œ

Q: So it™s territorial. 
A: Territorial almo st, you know, and th at 
exists everywhere that you go, and is 
between the nations. Now that I™m old, I rea
lize it. I remember th at when all Œ later 
on from 
India
, I was sent to 
Africa
, to 
Uga nda
, to a camp Œ Polish refugee camp. 
And the boys who are there, from 
India
 that came, and they said to me, you know, 
we can™t even go to a 
dance. This Œ Ug andan 
[indecipherable]
 won™t accept us, 
they call us. They  call us Indian s, and th
ey  don™t want us. They  were there maybe 
four or five years in that camp , and 
we just came over. And I remember I came 
over and I met a very 
[indecipherable]
 girl, you know, and I 
went over there, and 
some of the guys from 
India
 went over there, and I lear
ned to fight pretty well in 
India
. And I asked them, who is the leader of
 those boys? And they told me, well I 
dance, and I hit him so hard dancing polk
a, that he fell down . I stood over him, I 
said, do you want mo re, or no?
 And he said no. And our 
boys got up and th ey could 
already dance and play. But this is th
e clannishness of people. They were 
considering themselves African and 
we were Indians already to them. 
Q: And you™re already Pole Œ and your always 
Œ you were all Poles. 

A: And we were all Poles or from 
Russia
. But you see, this is clannishness, this is 
unbelievable in people. I notice it everyw
here. Everywhere I notice it, clannish. 
Look at when I was drafted into American
 army. There were five Jewish guys, and 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
26
there were three Ukrainians, and we all stuc
k together, we were Œ we were the best 
of friends, all the time, because we were from 
Poland
 and from 
Ukraine
, so we™re 
from that region, and in Amer
ican army . We felt that we have to protect ourselves 
from those dumb Americans, who choose to
 step on our feet, you know. It™s right 
away, and it was, you know Œ I told
 you ab out this Jewish fellow, 
Ja kubov i c
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
. He was in the American army, 
and he was in the barrack. He 
spent the whole war in a concentration camp in 
Germany
. And he used to wake up 
at night and scream. I went to Americans,
 explaining, please do something for this 
guy. He spent Œ well, Americans didn™t u
nderstand wh at it™s all about. Finally, I got 
to the rabbi. In the army there ar
e various reli gions, you know Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ people, and I got to a rabbi, went to 
a rabbi, and I told him, I said, this is 
criminal what they™re doing to  these guys
. He wakes up and he thinks, in the 
middle of the night that he™s in German
 concen tration camp . And they moved him 
right away, the rabbi put him in a separa
te room, and no more
 training, military 
training, he was taken care of the hot 
water for us. And bu-but Œ we Œ we Œ but 
people just don™t understand, people don™t 
understand other people in this wo rld. 
Very often a lot of misunderstandings are befall that. 

Q: Well Œ 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
27
A: And there are Œ and then there are a lo
t of very bad people. I wish they would 
get rid of them early, when they start 
only. Bu t how do you know th at they are 
going to  be bad 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: That™s true, you don™
t know. You don™t know. 

A: This is 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Jesus Christ 
parables, you read about it, that there is a 
good tree and a bad tree. And a good tree 
will give good fruits, and a bad tree will 
give you nothing. And the sa
me thing with people. You 
get some people that will 
be mean, and hurt a lot of people and 
everything, and there are people who will 
help you. 

Q: Let™s go back to 
Wilno
. I want you to paint a pictur
e for me, of what did this 
city in northeast 
Poland 
look like? What kind of a city
, how would you describe it? 
A: What? 

Q: 
Wilno
. How Œ how would you de
scribe it? The city 
A: Well, 
Wilno
 was a Lithuanian city. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And when 
Jagie

 married the Polish queen Œ 
Q: And who was 
Jagie

A: And he married Polish Queen 
Jadwiga

 well, they were really knights,
 you know, they Œ who were Œ 
Q: Crusaders. 
A: What? 
Q: You mean the Crusaders? 

A: Yeah, Crusaders. 

Q: So we™re talking history now,
 we™re talking 500 years ago. 
A: Oh yeah, we™re talking Œ so 
Wilno
 was a Lithuanian  city, and ev en  in the whole 
story how Œ who was it, 
[indecipherable]
 or somebody had the dream with the 
wolf and everything that they say, a
nd build th e castle and everything, and 
eventually got 
[indecipherable]
 somehow, in a bi
g way. And you had 
[indecipherable]
 Prince 
Rageev
(ph) 
[indecipherable]
 and there were only 
[indecipherable]
 might as well be in a Lithuanian family, because 
wich Œ
 mo st o f  
the families that were Lith
uanian were ending in 
wich
, 
Kaskaiwich
(ph), you know. 
Q: Mm-hm. So wh en you would wa
lk down the main street in 
Wilno
 as a child, 
what do you rememb er seeing? What 
kind of people were on the streets? 
A: Oh, they were Œ part of the town was 
Po lish, and part of the town was Jewish, 
there were so many Jews over there, Ha
ssidim and everything. And there Œ and 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
29
there were no more people, there were 
very few Lith-L ithuanians. There were 
almo st no Lithuanians in 
Wilno
. And mo-mo-mostly Polish. 
Q: Did you have Œ did 
you have interactions
 with Œ with any of the Jewish people 
there when  you were growing up? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: In the courtyard where I lived there wa
s a kosher butcher even
, and he had sons. 
And he used to take a blad
der, and he used to hang bl
adder and drying it out, you 
know. I don™t know 
[indecipherable]
 and he was doing something. So  we used to 
steal those, with his children, and we used to
 tie it to the cat™s tail, and cat™s tail was 
running like crazy because it was rattle a
nd making so much noise. And you know, 
we were going together, we were all play
ing together. W-We ha
d no friction that I 
remember of. I told you
 that I was dark and I was very often taken as Jewish. When 
my  mo ther used to go to  
stores, they used to say
 on za nasza
, he™s from ours, you 
know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The Jewish people thought
 that I was Jewi sh. But Œ 
Q: What language did they speak, usually?

A: Oh God, Yi-Yiddis-Yiddish.

A: No, no, no, no way, I didn™

Q: Y-Yeah, 
Is-Isaac Bashevis
 
Singer
, yeah. 
A: And those books, you know, I read his 
books in Polish translated from Yiddish. 
I love them, they™re hilarious. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Very funny, he™s very Œ he™s in 
Israel
 ti Œ I think. But he Œ 
he in Œ does books in 
Polish translation. He brought the beauty, 
I say, or I don™t know what it is, of 
Yiddish language, because it™s very nice, he
™s very funny in a way. But it is a nice 
language, but I don™t know it. When I came to 
Palestine
, you could speak Po lish 
everywhere, you know. The restaurants, th
ere were villages on, there were kibbutz 
already, they had, you know, those collec
tive farms over there. Girls used to bring 
us flowers in when we were marching. On
e girl I always remember, she had red, 
red shorts. Oh boy, was she pretty. I always tell 
Francesca
 about, yeah. 
Q: So Œ so th e picture that I™m getting 
is that you were born into a well-to-do 
family, that your mo ther had come over Œ

A: W-Well-to-do family which already lost 
a lot, but who will stay comfortab Œ but 
because of the taxes Œ remember, afte

wasn™t born yet, but when
 my mother went west Œ 
Q: From 
Minsk [indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, she went west to 
Poseland
(ph) and she was stayed in 
Horvath™s
 house, 
you know, where her brother was married, with
 my sister . My sister was just born, 
1919 she was born. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And 
Andy
(ph) was born, so they were toge
ther. And Œ and she Œ th-they had a 
boy and my mo ther had my  sister. And 
when they came ba
ck, there were no 
windows, there were no doors, there were no 
[indecipherable]
 there was nothing. 
You had to start everything 
from the beginning. It would 
[pho ne ring ing ] 
Q: Okay. All right, childhood was Œ 

A: Oh, ch ild was Œ was very happy. I was a sickly child. You see, one time there 
was big rain, and we had meadows, a
nd the work ers were cutting grass on the 
meadows, but there was water. And I had th
e teacher at home teaching me, I think 
four grades, first grades I was at h o me 
and we had a teacher, private teacher. And 
my father said, it™s beautiful day, we go 
over there. And we went over there. And 
there were so many snails in the grass, 
and I started picking th em. And I put my 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
32
hands to here and here a
nd here in the water. Well, 
what happened, I got a little 
blister here, I got a little blister here, I got 
a little blister h ere. 
My mother took me 
to the hospital in 
Wilno
. In 
Wilno
 they punctured them. Th
e next thing, I got a 
hundred blisters, spread up. And 
we were going to go Œ go in to 
Cha r na bo re
(ph), 
and you know, that was th
ree kilometers to go to 
Wilno
. And there was 
Leznakow
(ph), he had the store with the grocer
ies, with everything. And he said, 
there is a famous doctor, Jewish doctor from 
Warsaw
 here on Œ fo r vacation. So  he 
says, go over to him. And I went to him.
 He said, who the hell punctured those 
things? They didn™t know what they we
re doing. You cann
ot Œ he™s getting 
gangrene here, and under the arms already,
 gangren e is starting. So he gave some 
medications and there™s heat over here, bo
ttles, we got water and everything lined, 
and I have to keep  my  hands and legs up.
 And this lasted for several weeks, you 
know. So I constantly had so
mething. Either I had append
icitis, or I had that. I had 
this boil in my ear, I had boil 
in my  throat too, you know
. And I Œ tha-that was a lot 
of trouble, so I wouldn™t go almo st anywhere
. My sister used to go, but they  kept 
me more or less at home. But I was very 
happy because I had a hundred rabbits and 
I had my  pigeons and I had everything. And I was happy, and I had the 
Linden
 
tree, and I had a house in the tree, and there was Œ 
Francesca 
knows, it wasn™t far I 
Œ well, maybe half a kilometer was a railro
ad station from us, on the top, and there 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

was a boy there, he was my  friend, and we were making a dir Œ from wood, we 
were making trains and everything. I wasn™t
 allowed to play with him, because he 
spoke very bad Polish. It wa
s so funny, one time I came to him, and there was a 
fellow that was a miner in 
America
. Polish were in coal 
mines, and he bought 
himself a farm and he married a young girl
. And he bought his 
son very nice skis. 
And this fellow 
[indecipherable]
 he went and he stole his skis. And this man came 
to get the skis back. And his father was be
ating th Œ him with the belt like hell. And 
we go out from the house, and I said, 
why did your father beat you so mu ch, 
because you stole? No, no, no, that I don™t 
know how to steal, that™s why he was 
beating me. So you see, my  mo ther didn™t want me to play Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ but we used to go to 
the river. There was a river maybe a kilometer away from 
there, there were a lot of sn
akes in there, you had to we
ar boots. And we used to go 
fishing there, and I used to catch little 
fish, and eat them. Oh
, I loved fried little 
fish, you know. I Œ I all re Œ all remember
 th at, it was so nice. Then one time there 
was, in another place there was a fe
llow, they had the drugstore in 
Wilno
, and he 
went to school with me. And su ddenly , 
a big carriage was going by. And he says, 
look at that carriage, and I stopped the 
carriage, it was my grandfather carriage. 
Q: Oh my  gosh.

A: And we got into  it, and the car Œ they
 drove us around, you know, he drove us 
all around. And wh en I came back to school, 
this fellow say, did I have a ride in a Œ 
la carrozza
(ph), you know, and everything. Th
en , I tell you, they  came, poor 
children, Po lish boys. There was a scout ca
mp for small Polish boys, and ah Œ there 
mu st have been about a hundred  of them, a
nd they came to us to 
get straw, so they 
could make 
shiniki
(ph), you know, to sleep, and what
 they would Œ can give them 
some food. So we gave them some  potat
oes, some meat and ev erything to  help. 
And they invited me there for a week, and 
I was there. And not far from there was a 
camp from 
[indecipherable]
 I ge Œ I get the name. Oh God almighty, that was in 
Prussia
, on the border of 
Prussia
. 
Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm. 
A: And they were from there, th e Polish. 
Bu t they were big scouts, and they  made 
the big campfire. They were staying with on
e parish, where the priest had the thing. 
And we went over there. Then they trie
d to kidnap us, but we defended. But then  
all those boys said, we want to make campf
ire big too. And I said, well let™s go. We 
were across from my grandfather™s f-forest. 
S o  I said, come on kids, let™s go and Œ 

with me, and they all went, which was priv
ate property. So we all went, and they 
were picking everything, mu shrooms and 
fruits and wo od, you know, and th ey was 
bringing and going back, brin
ging more and finally the fo
rester caught us. And th e

doing here, you know. And I sa
id, I™m g randfather Œ this 
is my  grandfather™s land, so I give them

couple of days later and he says, boy, 
you pull your authority
. He says, you don™t 
get away, he told them Œ th
ey says, like my  thing, and I give them the permission. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So, you know, it was great 
thing with th e other kids,

d do and I Œ I opened up for them the forest, so Œ you 
know, in the forest ther
e are a lot of things Œ 
Q: Of course, of course. 

A: Œ growing, so th ey were so happy. 
Q: So it sounds Œ 
A: Those were Œ those were mostly poor children Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ from the town. 
Q: It sounds like a pr

A: I had beautiful childhood. You see, 
the day my  childhood ended, when th e 
Russians walked in, and I rea lized that my  parents cannot protect me. To this day, it 
stays in my mind.  
Q: Tell me about that day. 
A: To this day, that realization that 
now I have no protection. There™s somebody 
over us that can do us harm. 

Q: Tell me about that day. What happened? 
A: I don™t know. I just realized the Russian
s came to our property. They asked for a 
gun, my  father had a ra Œ gun, and when
 he walked out the Russians got scared 
because he was carrying the 
[indecipherable]
 to give it to them. Because they 
would have taken us to 
Siberia
 if they fo und weapons, you know. And it Œ and I 
realized that now is the end of that life. 
I Œ I realized it completely. And then later, 
when  we were being taken, 
which I told you before Œ 
Q: But we were gonna 
talk about it again. 
A: Yeah, you will talk about, but you see,
 this was the realization. Remember, I 
was 13 years old, I was small and everythi
ng, and all of a sudden I realized that 
everything™s gone. It™s not mine Œ wher
e Œ where they take the land away from 
you. They left us, I think, 
with 30 acres or so mething like that, a small field. I Œ  my 
father lost his hand, I had to
 do the plowing, I had to do
 the sowing, I had to ca Œ

they say, cu t, you know. I had to feed 
the cows, my sister was milk ing the cows. 
We couldn™t have workers, our workers ac
tually were bandits 
it turned out. There 
were seven sons and we had the family, a
nd when  their Œ it broke out, they went Œ 
there were a lot of bandits there, becau
se there was no Polish police, there was no 
Russian police, and people started robbing. 
And th ey Œ I played with the boy, there 
was one, he was the youngest son over ther
e in  that family. And his brother was 
cleaning his gun and he shot 
through a wall and ripped out the stomach of that boy, 
and that boy died. A
nd they took him to 
Felcher
(ph), you know, the closest help, 
but there was nothing th at can be done. I re
memb er that boy died
. So you know, all 
of a sudden, things started going all wrong, you know, all wrong. 
Q: Did you da Œ wh en the Russians came, 
had there been, even befo re that, was 
there any talk of Œ of wh at was going on in 
Europe
 and what was 
Poland
 going to 
do, and Œ 
A: Oh, my family, of cour
se, they were talking all 
the time, a-all th e time. 
Q: What kind of talks was it? What ki
nd of things were 
being discussed? 
A: Well, we heard 
Hitler
 screaming on the radio all 
the time, you know, wh en he 
was shouting and ev erything. And wi Œ 
Russia
 we knew, we were afraid of 
Russia
 
because we had a lot of local communist
s. There were Polish communists, there 
were Jewish communists, you know, over th
ere, a lot of Œ I mean, Jews were 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
38
communists, a lot of Poles were communists. Some people had all of sudden 
money, an d you knew th at it mu st be coming from 
Russia
, because 
Russia
 was 
exporting car loads, I understand of gol
d for propaganda and ev erything. So  you 
heard about it. There was police trou
ble, my  mo ther went to governor 
[indecipherable]
 he later became president of Œ of 
Poland
 in
 London
, and he told 
me well, it™s probably a 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know ho
w Œ what you say 
[indecipherable] 
that
 
at police station we consider ve
ry suspicious 
that they are 
pro
-B o l sh ev ik
, you know, but we cannot do anything
 to them, we have to prove it, 
you know. 

Q: Well, what was Œ what was the incident 
that brought your mo ther to go to him? 
What happened that she wanted  to go Œ 

A: Well, you had trouble, I don™t know, lik
e was some friction you know, in Œ in 

everything. You n Œ you know th-this is what
, if you could like, Jewish people used 
to come from 
Warsaw
 for vacation, like that docto
r. They were stupid, they, 
instead of talking to a peasant, 
with a little store or something, a 
prusha
(ph )  
panna
(ph), you know, and something like th
is, they s Œ they used to say 
g
upi
, like 
stupid, to th em. Eventu ally 
they started pulling knives ou
t, you know, because they 
got insu lted. It™s the same thing th
e way the British treated people in 
Africa
, you 
know, they were calling them, hey boy do 
this, hey boy, do that. It™s the same 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
39
thing, you know. And 
you don™t do it to people. You 
have to treat everybody with 
respect. That™s what I was told by my pa
rents, that you treat everybody with 
respect, never give them a reason, 
you know, to be mean to you. 
Q: So, when this changed,
 did you understand? I mean
, there was Œ it was Œ you 
were hearing 
Hitler
 screaming, but it was the Russians who were coming in. Why? 
A: Well 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did you know ab out it at the time? 
A: No, I don™t think we knew. We Œ we 
knew  later what happened, but I don™t 
know why 
Hitler
 was afraid to allow Œ to a-attack 
Poland
 alone. Wh ile 
Pilsudski
 
was alive, we knew he wouldn™t do it. When 
Pilsudski
 died, they said, well, 
Hitler
 
is not scared of 
Pilsudski
 any mo re. He Œ he had a me
ntal block because he beat 
the hell out of them, too, out of the Germ
ans. So we knew that
 there was bad, but 
we didn™t know about Œ there wa
s talk, and there was strange Œ 
Q: Who was pa Œ let™s say Œ tell us, who was 
Pilsudski
? 
A: What? 
Q: Who was 
Pilsudski
? 
A: 
Pilsudski
 was the Marshall of 
Poland
. 
Q: And he died wh en ? 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
40
A: H-He died in, what was it, ™36 - ™37 he
 died. And I remember we didn™t like him 
too much, we didn™t like his politics, but th ey said now is big trouble because he Œ 

we Œ they knew that 
Hitler
 had his Œ you know supers
titious or something, and 
then he Œ I si Œ I know now, you know, 
Litvin ov
 was thro wn  out because he was 
Jewish, and they put 
Mo lo to v
 and Œ 
Mo lotov 
and 
Ribben trop
 decided to attack 
together. So first the German
s attacked, then th
e Russians. But you see, you hear 
about 
Poland
 so much, but you don™t realize that after the campaign, 
Hitler
 in 
Poland
, for almost for a year he had to regr
oup his armi es and everything, and then 
he went after 
England
,
 Belgium
 and ev erything. He almo st didn™t make war. He 
couldn™t attack anybody. 
They say his losses i n  
Poland
 were tremendous. 
Q: Truly? 

A: Because 
Poland
 had anti-tank weapon, and we wa
nted to make call Œ call in, 
you know, reserves all. And 
England
 and 
France
 said don™t do it, because it will 
provoke 
Hitler
, so then don™t do it. So its mobilization started two days before 
Hitler
 attacked. And 
Hitler 
attacked accusing 
Poland
 that Polish troops went and 
attacked the radio station in 
Germ any
, and that™s what he told
 the Germans, that he 
sends the army  over there, and they  came
. But they couldn™t 
even distribute the 
weapon, because 
Poland
 had something like a bazooka to  destroy tank, and it was 
there, where they found it, 
Germany
 suffered tremendous losses, because those 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

41
tanks weren™t good, they had to start 
redesigning the tanks, because they were 
destroying them. But Œ 
Q: So 
Germany
 was attacking from the west. 
A: The west. 

Q: And Œ and Œ 

A: And about two weeks later, 
Russia
 came from the east. And 
Russia
 came, I™m 
telling you, they had strings on their horses.
 They came with th
e tanks that Œ with 
the lamp post and the ta
nk would burn, but they ke
pt coming and coming and 
coming. There were so many Russians that came over. I™ll tell you something 

better. To 
Patesha
(ph), to my  grandfather™s hous
e, some Russian soldiers came 
over and they said 
[speaks foreign language here]
 
Pani
(ph), you know
, when are 
you going to  come back ? They were from 
that region over th
ere, and they Œ 
Q: From wh ere your mo ther was born? 

A: From where my mother, and they ca
me over there and they were asking 
Pani
(ph), when are wa Œ when ar
e you going to come back, 
Pani
(ph)? 
Q: And that™s a Œ a ti Œ a term of respect. 

A: And those were Russians soldiers.  
Q: Yes, a term of respect saying, wh
en  are you going to come back and Œ 
A: Yeah. Never over there Œ 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

42
Q: Back to 
Belarus
. 
A: Œ because they were better off. 
They were living better off there. 
Russia
 was 
something Œ because th ey didn™t
 know about the west, you know. 
K-Karl Marx
 
and 
Lenin
 and 
Trotsky
, they all promise people everything. They said we will be 
paradise. And when  you live in 
Siberia
, in the remo te areas, I told you, those 
people didn™t know anything. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: They didn™t know
, they thought Œ 
Francesca
 has a brother-in-law, a Russian 
from 
Crimea
, he married. And he says, wa Œ we
 lived there, but we didn™t see 
anything better. We thought 
everybody lives like that.  
Q: Okay . So , you see the soldiers come in
, you see that your father has to give a 
gun up, the one weapon, and 
you realize that your fam
ily, your parents cannot 
protect you any mo re. Did they  ever have
 conversations with you about what all 
this meant, about what
 all these si Œ all these political things? 
A: I don™t know, we probably ha
d, but I cannot tell you. Then  
Stalin
 gave 
Wilno
 to 
Lithuanians, and we were in Lithuanian 
region. So  I was living in  grandmother™s 
house in 
Wilno
, and I was going to  gymn asium. So Œ 
Q: So that™s in the center of town? 
A: So that was a very good period for 
us again, you see? Very good period.

Q: How did it change? How did life change wh en it Œ 
A: Well, it was normal. 

Q: Okay, normal. 
A: It was normal life, except you didn™t wa
nt to get in the mess somewhere with 
[indecipherable]
 wh o hated Po les, if you came in some where, and there was 
somebody living, and so mebody else was living, they said 
[speaks foreign 
language here]
 Polish pigs don™t live here.
 Siaulisi
(ph). They  were Lithuanian, but 
they had hated li-like 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: 
Siaulisi
(ph) were they like Œ 
A: 
Siauliai
. 
Q: Okay , were th Œ who Œ can yo
u explain who they were, these 
Siaulisi
(ph)? 
A: I Œ I cannot tell you, it was a party of people, Lithuanian, you know, it was a 
party. They were against Poles, against ev
erything. They used to
 come in even to 
the cathedral to beat up the peop
le when they were singing Œ 
Q: Hymn s. 

A: 
[indecipherable] 
return 
Poland 
to us, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It was trouble, but otherwise it was all 
rig h t. Police was fantastic. We had a Œ wa 
Œ carriage stolen before the war, and L
ithuanians, when th ey came, policeman 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

came and he told us that Œ and my father
 told them, you know, 
they were asking, 
anything stolen? Yeah, my  father said, be
fore the war. In abou
t two weeks, they 
had it. They took my  father there and they
 said, here is your carriage. One day we 
woke up and we had ab out 
60 or 70 ch ickens, you know? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And we come in and there are no ch icke
ns, everything was stolen. By  evening, 
Lithuanian police had it. They were very 
effective, and they were very effective 
with thieves, because they 
got scared, because the Lith
uanian police used to put 
wet sheets and beat the hell out of the pe
ople. And they said, 
you know, across the 
kidneys and everything. So th
ey fo und out that stealing doesn ™t pay. And the Po lish 
rule is like in 
America 
you do. Wh en Œ wh en the Œ
 
and you know how it is with 
stealing; if you steal a loaf of bread, 
you™re a thief. If you steal a million dollars, 
well, you defrauded somebody. But if you st
eal 10 million dollars, or 20 million, ah 
kleptomania, he™s sick. 
Tha-That™s the law in 
America
, you don™t go to jail. Let 
stockholders pay, like in 
America
. 
Q: Yeah. So Œ 

A: I Œ that is unbelievable. And then, 
you know, this came a
nd then there Œ the 
period went very fast. We had that thing in 
Wilno
 then, the 
[indecipherable]
 
Kiersnowski
, that was mine 
[indecipherable]
 he came first and he opened a

nightclub, who Œ called 
[indecipherable]
. So  there was freedom, you know. And 
then his wife 
[indecipherable]
 cross, in the winter she got very hard  time crossing 
the river. They came ov er and they said Œ 
Q: They came from w h ere? 
A: From 
Wa rsa w
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And oh, what™s her name? 
Oh God, I was thinking, oh
 well, the famous Polish, 
this girl singer. She was Jewish. She married Count 
Iscaris
(ph) and he, my  cousin 
was writing songs for her, you 
know, for the show and ev
erything, so it was very 
successful. And then  I don™t know ho
w they got permission to go to 
Vladivostok
, 
to 
Japan
. Sh e had connections with 
g emeinde
. And then I met her father finally, in 
America
 when they came here
 in the show. They we
re Œ all the Jews in 
New York 
were there, writing in that show. It was 
itwee Œ and it was Œ it was good life o Œ at 

that period, and then  all of a sudden, I re
member they came, and they arrested us, 
and we were taking, and pe
ople were kneeling down  along th e road, and pray ing 
for us Œ 

Q: Who is they? 
A: Œ wh en th ey saw us being 
taken in a carriage, you know? 
Q: Who came, who took you?

A: Polish people, the rus Œ well, there was one Jewish 
NKVD
 officer, a Polish 
communist and two Russian soldiers. And th
ey came early in 
the morning, they 
knocked on the doors, 
you know, and th Œ and they to ld
 us to pack . 
But I told you 
about my sister before, my siste r was pa
cked, because she had dreams that the man 
comes here to prepare your things, you™re
 going to  go for a long trip. She already 
had that thing th at happened  in 
Russia
 with her, but she was packed . And th en th-
they Œ th -they took us to 
Œ to th e station, and in 
Cha rnibo r
(ph), my mother™s sister 
came with her husband and two daughters,
 and th ey brought our grandmother, and 
she was an old, old woman. She had a brok en hip, and he Œ we begged the Ru ssians 
not to take them, and they
 finally let her stay in 
Poland
. And Œ and 
Korfs
(ph) were 
there, and then Œ 

Q: What was there? 

A: 
Korf
(p h) too, Baron 
Ko rf
(ph) was there too, brought in there. And th en they  
put us in trucks an d they took us to 
No wa  Vileka
(ph) and in 
No wa  Vileka
(ph) they 
separated the men. My father got what, 10 years or 12 years they told him in gulag, 

and Œ and Œ and they  got it, and we neve
r saw them again. Well, I know th at my  
father died, I have everything. The other 
ones were thrown ou
t from the railroad, 
because they were on the ra
ilroads when they die in car
s, so they just opened the 
door and they threw the bodies into
 the tundra somewhere, I don™t know.

Q: That™s after it™s all left Œ after Œ 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 yeah. 
Q: Yeah. So at that 
point when you™re at 
Nowa Vileka
(ph), and from what I 
understand, that is a train 
station in a small suburb of 
Wiln o
, isn™t it? 
Nowa 
Vileka
(ph) is a Œ 
A: 
Nowa  Vileka
(ph), I cannot tell you. 
Q: Is a small village. 
A: I don™t remember that Œ well 
it™s a Œ it™s a railroad station. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: It™s small. It™s a small 
thing, but there were trains over there, and that™s where 
they took us, not to 
Wilno
, but to 
Nowa Vileka
(ph), in th e trucks, and th at™s where 
they separated, and that was the place wh
ere my father told 
me, when they were 
taking him away, 
Stasch
(ph), I am not going to survive 
Russia
, I™m going to die. 
From now on, you™re responsible for your 
mo ther and sister, promise me that. You 
take care, you su rviv e 
Russia
. I will not survive. And hi
s last words were, when I 
was Œ I told you 
[speaks Polish]
, remember, 
Russia
 doesn™t like tears. Don™t ever, 
ever show a Russian that yo
u™re afraid. And he was so 
right, later on in life I found 
out, because when th ey  arrested me I told
 them, what the hell can you do to me? I 
said, you took my  father away, you took me to 
Siberia
, we™re hungry, we have no

heat, we have nothing. Wh
at do you do? I told the 
NKVD
 officer, just take and 
shoot me if you want. He says, go home. 
And they had me for 
stealing, you know, 
and the other two went to jail.  
Q: We™ll come to that incident, we™ll come
 to that incident. So the last time you see 
your father is at this 
N o wa Vileka
(ph) train station. 
A: That™s was Œ I don™t know whether it 
was 14 or 15, I think it was 14 or 15 Œ 
Q: Of what? 
A: Œ of June. 
Q: Of June, in 1941. 

A: Seven-Seventy-th ree years ago. 
Q: Yeah. We™re Œ this inte
rview™s taking place on June 20
th
, so we™ve just passed 
that anniversary. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: We were locked up a day Œ th e train 
was a  smal l car.  Ther
e were Œ this was a 
small cattle train. There were four little
 windows about this size, you know, and 
they put boards two layers of boards like th
is, on one side and on the other side. So 
we were lying, but you had to lie on 
the side, because you couldn™t lie on your 
back, there was no room. And sitting was a di
saster. And they cut a little hole in the 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
49
floor for you to go and relie
ve yourself, as a toilet. But somehow, the people had 
some blankets, so they put some strings ar
ound and they  put bl
anket around, so you 
had privacy. Only twice they 
allowed us to Œ off the trai
n, for in three weeks that 
we were going. Let me tell you, you Œ you
 never Œ you never know the stor Œ the 
sight of people, who when after weeks of 
sitting, lock, and not 
being able to walk, 
get out. Everybody had to go to th e 
bathroom immediately. And everybody 
squatted, nobody cared  wh ere; women, men,
 everybody squatted and Œ a-a-and that 
was the life. 
Q: It sounds awful. What was it li Œ ye
ah, I in terrupted  you 
as you were saying 
people, as you were being taken, were 
kneeling on the street, you know, kneeling 
on th e road as you were being arrested. 

A: Who Œ wha Œ 

Q: You said people were kneeling on the road. 

A: Yeah, and praying for us, in Œ i-in 
[indecipherable]
. They were praying for us, 
there was, you know, they were Œ all 
knew wh at™s happening to us. You know, 
deportation to 
Siberia
 was known for a long time with
 the tsars and everything. So 
they knew that they
 want us exterminated over th
ere, and then th ey™ll probably 
never see us again. 

Q: And that would be b
ecause you were rich, or because you were Polish? 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
50
A: Yeah, Polish, rich, there were some Je
ws taken too. There were some Jews not 
taken. In this car where we were, ther
e was one Jewish nurse. I don™t know, she 
was very nice girl, and maybe she saved my  
life, I™ll tell you, because I got mumps, 
and Russian doctor, they open
 th e door, and they gave me in a glass Œ I don™t know, 
it was enclosed glass here, there was medica
tion. And they Œ he told  us to give 
ookoe
(ph) give me an injection, and th ey cl
osed the door and he walked out. And 
she was a hospital nurse and she says, I have syringe. So she brought it, she took it 
and she gave me injection fo r that, you kn
ow. Whether it help or
 not, I don™t know. 
Maybe I would have been all right. But she was Œ she was the only Jewish person 
in our car, you know. And goo Œ who kno
ws ho-ho Œ who th ey took? They took 
prostitutes too. They took prostitutes too, 
they later had problem with them in 
India
 and ev erywhere. Women, you know, you
 can™t tell what the hell they were 
doing, they were all crazy. Th
ey wanted to take all th
e people wh o had property, 
destroy th em, but they also want to de
stroy everybody else. It™s madness. This 
world is ma d. Every day, the older I get, 
the more I see it. I to
ld after the second 
World War that somehow it will stab
ilize. Look what™s going on now. 
Q: When  you were in that tra Œ did you stay
 in the train station for a long time, or 
did the trains move out immediately? 
A: I cannot tell you, I don™t rememb er, you know.

Q: Okay . 
A: We went, and we started going, and I 
Œ I didn™t know geography that well, but 
the Polish people, they™re olde
r, they knew the railroad station that we were going. 
And once a day or Œ or something, they used
 to open th e door and they took fo ur 
men with buckets to bring in 
so me food, and they used to
 give us bread. But that 
bread was so bad that if you threw it agai
nst the wall it would stick to the wall. It 

was like thing Œ w-we Œ we t
ook some food with us from 
Poland
, thank God, you 
know, we had some Œ well, little food, an
d Œ but then, along the railroads, the 
Russians were standing, beggi
ng for food. Wh at did th ey expect? People that are 
being deported to 
Russia
, they were still standing w
ith their hands outstretched, 
many station. And th ey had Ru ssian soldiers
, and we didn™t have enough water, it 
was hot. And I was asking Ru ssians Œ sold iers, you know 
[indecipherable]
 kettle. I 
used to open the win Œ this Œ the window 
was open and I used to
 Œ and you Œ there 
were two Russians, I told yo
u that before, a-a Œ on the side, they wouldn™t give me 
the water. But the minute there was only one
 Russian soldier on that side of the 
train, he would grab the ke
ttle, run and bring me water. 
They were so petrified of 
each other, that they were afraid to
 Œ to Œ to give us anything.  
Q: But Œ but it also shows that Œ th
at once they  Œ once that fear is Œ

Q: Œ is gone, then it Œ 
A: Œ people become human. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: People be-become human. We had a fri
end there, and he was German, he was a 
tank officer, and he lived
, and he was with the 
Korfs
 and with 
[indeciphera b le]
 
you know, families connected. 
And he was so nice, and then
 just before the war he 
got an order to return to 
Germany
, to his unit. So we knew that something was 
cooking, you know, we were expectingthat something will happen. And he was 
crying, he didn™t want to go to  
Germa ny
. And then, after the war, they learned that 
he was killed in the last day of the wars, when 
Berlin
 fell, he was killed 
[indecipherable]
 I remember; tall, blonde, handsome fellow, and he was there. 
You rememb er people you know, you re
memb er so ma ny people, and Œ because 
you were meeting so many people. But you
 have to remember, I was 13 - 14, and 
what did I know, you know, I 
didn™t know much, except th
at I helped quite a lot as 
a child, at the parties, at meetings. My 
uncle was a senator, you know, so I heard a 
lot about politics always, and 
my grandfather was involv
ed in parties, you know, 
political parties and everything. So we
 heard a lot of what was going on. 
Q: Tell me, why did your fa
mily not particularly like 
Pilsudski™s 
politics? It™s just 
an interesting Œ

53
A: I couldn™t tell you. 
Q: You wouldn™t know why. 

A: I couldn™t tell you. I think one of the 
thing was that he once blew  a train and 
sold the money. Or da Œ it was Russian m
oney, or Au strian money, I don™t know, 

but the family was talking that that™s st
ealing. That that™s im-imp roper, you cannot 
steal. You know, I Œ they were talking about it. 
Pilsudski
 had a very hard life 
because his sister used to come and sit 
in my grandfather™s house. On the deck  
there were flowers. Oh, it was so beautif
ul over there, You cannot imagine how 

many flowers, agave, you kn
ow, was growing, and ever
ything. Palms, little. And 
sh-she was talking and she was saying 
that you know, when you are in the 
government like my  brother is, they prin t 
special papers for him. He cannot even  
get the news. I can tell you wh at™s going on 
in the country, but they Œ other groups, 
you know, they surround y
ou. They are like plague, 
you don™t know. You have 
advisors, I guess in every government it™s th
e same  thing, you know, they Œ th-they 
Œ they Œ they  do everything. Bu t she wa
s saying th at it™s a famous building in 
Warsaw
, 
do m bez ka nto w
. 
Kant 
means a corner, but it 
also means without 
cheating. So they said wh
en  they  were build ing th is build ing, they came to 
Pilsudski
 and said, well, build one building 
bez kantow
. Build one building 
without cheating, you know. An
d they cut off the 
corner, it™s said to this day you

can go on computer and you write 
dom bez kantow
 and they show it in 
Warsaw
, 
the home. And this became famous 
dom bez kantow
. So you know, it™s not easy to 
be a ruler. 
Q: No, no. 
A: Because you don™t know what influenc
es you, or what goes on. I tell you, the 
Russian people that we met,
 a lot of them were very
, very  nice, you know? But 
when  we went south in 
Siberia
, there were Mongols, but over there it became 
much worse, because the pe
ople were hungry already. 
Q: We™re gonna get to that part. I still want
 to be on the train right now. So when 
you were on the train, did you ever 
get any announcement, or any paper, or 
anything from those people who arrested yo
u, as to why you were being deported 
and where you were
 being taken? 
A: No, no, they di
dn™t talk to us. 
Q: So you didn™t know. In ot
her word s, people knew the Œ 
A: Oh, we knew why, because the tsars us
ed to do it. They  Œ once you go to 
Siberia
 you saw all kinds of people, German
s, Ukrainians, th
ey used to call 
[indecipherable]
, Tartars from 
Crimea
 they were deporting ov
er there. They were 
deporting people for years. 
This is one procedure in 
Russia
, take people and send 
them to 
Siberia
, it™s empty. You know, you were 
going for days on, and you hardly

saw a little station, where they only ha
d water and maybe some coal for the 
railroad, and the train. It was a Œ it™s
 like a no man™s land, you go and go and 
there™s nothing. It™s a disaster. A nd th
en, in some places
 they build like 
[indecipherable]
 the soil was very good, you kno
w. But this was funny. I™ll tell 
you something; we were there, I never sa
w a rabbit, I never saw a fox, I never saw 
any animal alive or dead. Wh
ether they ate them when 
they were starving, when 
there was starvation in the 
[indecipherable]
 you know, or Œ or what, I don™t know. 
Because I was fr Œ with a friend 
Fruzhinski
(ph) later in 
India
 and he was work ing 
in sulfur mine and there was a lot of go
ld. And the mine, being broken, pressed his 
chest in. He couldn™t be in the army, yo
u know, he had a hole 
Œ hole in there. And 
he said that that mine, a
ll the Russians were laughing because Americans came in 

the 30s, engineers, and they develope
d that mine. And he said, how stupid 
Americans are. Don™t Œ Russians were 
saying, don™t they  know how secretive 
Russians are? Of course they had an accid
ent and they buried
 them over there. 
Once the mine was open 
[indecipherable]
 
America 
the worst place in 
Russia
, 
gold mine, and the worst concentration ca
mp , where if you lasted two years you 
were lucky, they Œ you 
froze, it™s n a Œ close to 
Alaska
. That was be Œ opened up 
with American help. How about 
[indeciphera ble]
, the city 
Volga
(ph ) ? 
Volga
(ph) 
was built by all this Œ 
a fort. So you know, 
America
 did all the business they could, 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
56
and they  say 
Russia 
was starving its people, selling 
its food and trying to get 
machinery and ev erything from 
America
. And 
America
 did business with them, 
capitalists, what do 
they care? They don™t care wh
ether hundred million people 
died. To hell, as long as I make my m
illion, that™s my opinion. I don™t know 
whether I should say that, but as long as
 you can make money, it™s all right. You 
see, brokerage houses, when  I started,
 were private companies, they were 
partnership. And if they were doing busine
ss, they were very, 
very afraid. If they 
made some thing wrong, it was their pocket. And then they allowe
d them to become 
corporation. So now people who run co rpor
ation can steal, make themselves rich, 
and if they get punish, who pays the st
ockholder? The stockholders are punish ed, 
and they  lose the money. 
Q: Different system. 

A: Ju-Ju-Just look at American hi
story now. They make a mistake 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah. Where did you fina
lly land? Wh en  you, you k
now, went for three weeks 
on th e train Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ wh ere did it stop? 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
57
A: Well, it™s first Œ the big st
ation was, when we stopped, 
Nowosibirsk
. It™s right 
in the middle of 
Siberia
, I think, it 
[indecipherable]
. Then they turned south, to 
Barn aul
, and th en we went to 
Rubtsovsk
. 
Go rbachev™s 
wife was born over there 
in 
Rubtsovsk
.  
Q: 
Raisa
, uh-huh. 
A: And then from there we went by carriage 
to the village where we were. And as I 
told you, we were very lucky that we we
re not sent to collective farm, or some 
mine, or bri Œ bricklayers place where th
ey make. But we were in a village. The 
people were very nice to us. The 
NKVD
 didn™t bother us. 
The only thing the 
bastards did to us, they  came to our hous
e, and my  sister hid everything in the 

stove, in ashes; pictures that we had, a
nd papers. And my  aunt 
was afraid, and Œ my 
mother™s si ster, she wa s stupid, she told th
em about it and they took all our pictures 
of my  father, of the youth, you kno
w, we had a lot of pictures from 
Poland
, album. 
And they  took ev erywhere, and they  took all the coffee books. We had those coffee 

book with watermar
ks. When they saw watermark, ratio n 
NKVD
, they never saw 
it, they say 
[speaks foreign language here]
 we™re German spies, right away they 
said, because you have waterm
arks on paper. So they  think th is is for sending 
messages. They  never saw anything like 
this. They were very poor. You know, 
when Russians march i n to 
Poland
 we used to ask them, oranges 
[indecipherable]
 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
58
oranges? And th ey said, oh yeah , we have 
factories, they make them. That was the 
standard answer. They didn
™t know what it was. Because I never saw sugar in 
Russia
 once. No, I saw one Russian woman Œ o
fficer, having a piece of sugar, she 
was eating it with water. But that was th
e only time I saw sugar. I never saw sugar 
in 
Russia
. So it was Œ it was in Œ inhuman la
nd, it was inhuman co untry, and I 
think it is to this day. They said 
[indeciphera ble]
 there was Radio 
Moscow
 here, I 
was listening and th ey were talking, menall drinking, smoking. 
Trains you cannot 
travel. There are no roads to drive on, you 
know. And that was Œ that report is from 
Moscow
 saying. You know, that Œ it was Œ it was bad. 
Q: When  you were Œ when  
you were first taken to 
Nowosibirsk
, then you were 
diverted by train to 
Barnaul
 is that it? 
A: Yeah, it was same train there, and Œ 
Q: The same train? 

A: Œ I tell you, I was petrified when I saw 
Nowosibirsk
. I never saw such a 
tremendous station, and there were loudspeak ers talking all the time and 

everything. And I never saw anything so bi
g, it was treme n dou
s. And then they 
turned  around, and we we
nt south, you know, to 
Barn aul
. Then I saw much more 
of southern 
Russia
 when we were released already.

Q: Oh, we™ll Œ we™ll get there, we™ll get there. So in 
Ba rnaul
 then you™re Œ the 
same train goes toŒ 
A: Yeah, all the way. It was the same train all the way.  
Q: To ruda Œ what was it called? 
A: Wait Œ wait. 
Nowosibirsk
, 
Barnaul
. 
Rubtso v sk
. 
Q: 
Rubtsovsk
. 
A: 
Rubtsovsk
.  
Q: And then  you said yo
u were taken by car from 
Rubtsovsk
? 
A: Not by car, by carriage, horse carriage.
 There was a little carriage, you know Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ like you saw th em in 
Lithuania
 with Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ the horse, and we had to walk mo st
 of the way because our suitcases were 

there. It was Œ I don™t know, it was 30 - 40 
[indecipherable]
 what is it, miles? I 
don™t know, it was pretty far a whole day.
 And we came to that village, and si Œ 
there was an empty house with two rooms.
 There was Œ in one room there was a 
stove, and there was a little like place where 
they did something, so there was wood 
on building. So we used to 
take that wood and burn in
 the stove. You cou Œ were 
not allowed to go to  forest and bring any 
forest, because this is government. I told

60
you how, one time I went to pick up 
szyszki
 Œ how do you call it? From pine trees, 
you know, corns. 
Q: Yeah, the cones. 
A: And we were Œ we
 were using them Œ 
Q: Okay , you were using Œ 
A: Œ from Œ 
[phone ringing] 
Q: Okay , cut. 
[tape break]
 Yes, all right, so you were
 saying, you went in the 
forest and you got these pine cones. 

A: Yeah. And th e Russians, they all ran away, and I didn™t run away . And the f-

forest man comes, and he said 
kudova
(ph), from where you are? And I said, I™m 
from 
Poland
, you know 
ya polak
(ph). And he says, why didn™t you run away , to 
me, you know, 
[speaks foreign language]
 Because you were stealing government 
pines, and you cannot steal govern ment pi
nes. And if you Œ next time, you run, 
because otherwise I™ll go to jail for not 
arresting you. The Russians were all 
running away, and he told me, you 
have to run. And then  he says 
[speaks foreign 
la ng ua g e ]
 I Œ also, you™re from 
Poland
, let™s sit down and talk. Wha Œ what™s Œ 
how life is in 
Poland
, tell me. They were so curious that you 
[indecipherable]
 
there was nobody around us, you know Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
61
A: Œ but he pleaded with me, next 
time if you come to take the pines Œ 
Q: Pine cones.  
A: Œ take the pines, but run like a crazy wh
en I come, because th
ey™ll arrest me, and 
I™ll go to jail. Then I told you about kerosene. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I went Œ well, no, I have to start that a 
little different story. This is another story. 
When the Russian woma
n with the daughter came to us
 already in that little h ouse, 
and she ask whether my  sister has any dresses to sell because the daughter is 

getting married, and she would 
like to have a nice dress. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And my sister says, well, I can sell you 
one dress. And Œ and th e girl was there, 
you know, they measured my
 sister. Okay, I™ll re-sew 
it a little, I™ll correct it fo r 
you. And she Œ the minute she left, neighbor
s of ours in those buildings came and 
said, watch out. He is the chief communist for the whole area. Top co mmunist, 
that™s his wife. Be very careful what you 
do with them. They are big communists. 
And then she came few days la
ter, she picked up 
the dress and she 
to ok  my  mo th er 
and sister to their house. And listen the st
ory about their house. 
They walk in, they 
had bars on the doors and on
 the windows, they were so
 afraid. And he told my 
mother, my family, before 
the revolution was fairly well-off. And I decided that I 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
62
won™t raise my family in pov
erty. So I joined 
the party and I became a communist 
and I am the head of this district. And he 
was very nice, and he 
said look, probably 
the Germans will come here. We Œ we won™t 
be able to withsta
nd their Œ Russian Œ 
a-a-a Œ the German army. And, can you pr
otect us from German
s? And  my  mo th er 
said well, if Germans come here, they
 might shoot me first and then you. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, as a communist. And Œ my  mo
th er said no. And then  he ask what 
I™m doing, you know, and his son was wo
rking in a place where there were 
repairing metal 
[indecipherable]
 tractors, comb ines and everything. And he was 
bringing water. So when his son went to sc
hool, they  gave me that job. And once a 
day you got food over there, so you know,
 what a privilege it was in that place. 
And we didn™t have kerosene
 for lamp. And I came to him once, he was sitting Œ he 
was the ma nager of the whole place, and I said to him 
[speaks foreign language 
here]
 because in Russian it™s kerosene, too, 
and I made mistake, in Polish we say 
nafta
(ph), in Russian Œ so he said 
[speaks foreign language]
 Well, and he told me 
that I cannot give it to you. This is go
vernment. I™ll go and get arrested. Then  he 
says, quiet, but over there 
there is a woman which 
[indecipherable]
 some 
equipment. You go to her with the bottle
 where nobody sees, a
nd she will give you 
kerosene in a bottle. But don™t let anybody
 see it, and run away quickly, and you 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

will have kerosene for the lamp at home. A
nd then he locked th
e door, and he says, 
where were you li Œ wh ere were you living?
 And well, we™re deported here, and he 
started talking with me, and he was the gu
y who to ld me he couldn™t believe that 
we had farms, that we had property. Nobo
dy has property. And th en we tell him to 
America
 and he says, can you amer Œ can you imagine those strikes in 
America
? 
People rather die than work in 
America
. They go on strike, because see in 
Russia
, 
if you went on a strike, they would have
 killed you. So here was Œ they were 
reading in 
America Œ
 in their Russian papers about the strikes in 
America
. That™s 
how they were interpreting, that those people  were so poor that they™d rather die. 
Q: Yeah, they™d rather die. 
A: Because in 
Russia
 th ere were too main newspapers
. I think I told you there was 
Pravda [indecipherable]
.
 Pravda
 is the truth, 
[indecipherable]
 is news. And the 
Russians were saying the problem with our pa
pers is that in truth there is no news, 
and in th e news there is no truth. That™s 
what the Russians were
 saying. They  were 
laughing, but they didn
™t know. They just di
dn™t know anything. 
Q: When  you got there, did they put yo
ur mo ther and your sister to work ? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: What did they have to do? 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

A: Well, first we were digging cellars, a
nd we were very nice. Every time we took 
a shower Œ and me too Œ and every time 
we th rew a shower we said, hundred 
Russians on the German front, you know, 
and Œ and th e Œ and Œ a-and th en they  
switched us to forests, and to work in 
the forest. And there were Œ I don™t know 
where the other Poles came, you know, they
 were engineers and everything. They 
had no idea how to cut the tr
ee down. I had to teach them
, because I grew up on a 
farm and I saw how Œ how workers were cu
tting the tree, and which way the tree 
falls and every Œ they  had 
no id ea. I had to teach them
, you know, I used to walk 
around, big Œ big guy,
 I had big shoes. I had big s
hoes because Germans shot up a 
train not far from our home, and the next thing we had 
[indecipherable]
 soldiers 
wore big shoes, and their shoe
s were long. And oh God, in 
Russia
, when I had the 
ax, I hit it, the shoe, I thought I cut off 
my  fingers Œ my  toes, but the shoe was 
much too large, so I didn™t cu
t off my legs. But 
I thought Œ was afra
id that I cut off. 
They had very good steel. 
Oh, the steel was fantastic, th
e axes and everything. You 
see, we had to make so many two yards 
long, like Œ like two meters long, maybe 
meter wide, like this, and maybe a meter hi
gh. Wood, we had to cu t it in pieces, 
and put it. And every day we 
had to Œ we had a norm, how many we had to do. So, 
we figured  very fast way, cut wo od in small pieces, and on the ends we put small 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

65
pieces, then everything is empty inside, and we cover with the logs on top, and the 
Russian Œ 

Q: And there™s the norm.  
A: Œ and the Russian was wondering that we could make a couple of norms in a 
day in th is way. Bu t we were cheating. And they came, they co unted and they  went 

and they  were happy. An
d there was plenty of 
[indecipherable]
 cucumber woman, 
she was always bringing us cucumb ers to
 eat, you know, she had cucumb ers. And 
people were very nice, they we
re trying to help  us. And Œ 

Q: So you didn™t Œ there wasn™t anybo
dy that you experienced wh o Œ who was 
cruel, or Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ or was tough, or was Œ

A: Well, I told you about my sister, 
she came over there and sh e started telling 
fortune. And the next thing, the Ru ssians 
were coming from all sides. One thing Œ  
you know, I was laughing alwa
ys at it. You know, I was small, to me it was funny. 
But she used to lay cards a
nd look at them, an d she said, I don™t see cards, I see 
something else. And one time there was a wo
man that came over and sh e said that 
her husband is in jail, a
nd do you know when he will 
come out and 
everything? 
And my  sister told him Œ and there were other Russian wo men Œ my sister said, 
vrosh
(ph), you lie. Why? You husband is a pilo
t. And she says no, no, he™s in jail, 
I™m telling you. Sh e says no, he™s 
a pilot. One day he™s here in 
Russia
 and one day 
he™s over there. He must be a pilot, he™s all over 
Russia
. She says yeah, he™s a 
pilot. You know? There was this other 
case that a Russian wo man run in to our 
house, this little house that we had. She 
opened  the window and she went ptoo, 
ptoo, ptoo, you know, and sh
e ran out, closed the door and ran out. And few weeks 
later my sister got an absce
ss in her throat. And sh e Œ they
 took her to hospital, they 
gave her tubes, they fed her thro ugh th e t
ubes. And she came back after a couple of 
weeks. And then again, sa
me thing happened
. And then  this old Russian wo man 
came, and she says 
Ganichka
(ph) she says, doctors won™t cure you, this is Siberian 
curse fell on you. These doctors don™t know 
how to remove it. I will remove it and 
it will go away, don™t worry. And my sister 
was to go again to the hospital, because 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

67
the abscess is started. And she says, we
ll you are Catholic, ma
ybe you don™t want 
it. So she took linen  piece of cloth, she 
put some ashes into it, and dipped it in 
sunflower oil, and she prayed over that. 
And she made three balls, and she to ld my  
sister, rub your neck once, then after an
 hour rub it again and throw it behind you 
and tell time. Next mo rning there was no sign of abscesses. And this woman was a 
tragic story, because she had the son in 
the army, and she was always asking how 

her son is, and she used to come with 
friends. And my  sister, one day, almo st 
broke. Her son is dead, sh-she
 see in the cards that her s
on is dead. Sh e couldn™t tell 
her that. But she told her friends; don™t 
say anything, but her son is dead. About 
week later, or in 10 da
ys, she comes over to my sister  a nd she says, 
Ganichka
(ph), 
I saved your life, I did everything I coul
d fo r you. Ho w could you do it to me? If 
you told  me that my  son is dead , it would have been all right, but I got a m-me ssage 

from the government that my  son died, and 
all my  friends told me that you to ld him 
that he died, how could you do this to 
me? You see how difficult it is in life? M y  
sister didn™t have the heart to 
tell her that her son was dead.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: There were a lot of Jewish women who were coming, because not far from there 
was a resort, with salt water lake, and from there, from 
Moscow
 they flew, the 
Jewish women with children. 
And they used to come Œ we
 couldn™t go over there,

because we would have to 
get permission from police. 
We couldn™t go anywhere 
from that village, we™re not allowed to
 go anywhere, where you had to get 
permission from the village. But 
they used to come to us 
and they used to come to 
tell fortune. And another thing was that th
ere was a policeman, and he came to my 
sister, and she says, oh, you™re getting ma
rried tomorrow. And 
he says, how do you 
know? Well, I see it in the cards. But today 
[indeciphera ble]
 to have a party. And 
she says, no drinking, and no 
fighting. If you drink, you fight, and you be arrested. 
And next day, he was in jail. He got into 
a fight. But my sister
 told him that. So, 
you know, Russians trusted her, and th at
™s why they were always fr-from our 
home, you know, they always ga
ve us two eggs, or they ga
ve us some milk, or they 
gave us some bread they brought us. An
d you know, so we were getting food from 
them, from 
Hanya™s
(ph) telling fortunes, and telling.
 And then the Russians told 
her to stop working, because she was gettin
g sick very often. Sh Œ my sister 
[indecipherable]

d her of all the work. They said, 
you don™t work , only your mo

any news of where he was at the time, 
or wh at had happened  to him, or wh ere his train had gone?

 And when she said to 
my  mo ther, did you have a husband without the hand, you know. And my  mo ther 
said yes. Well, I buried your husband. So 
that™s how my mother 
first found out. But 
in that place where he was Œ died, there wa
s his half-brother, and he was an officer 
in Polish army . And that™s why I have a picture of his grave. 

Q: I see. I see. 

A: And Œ and we have deat
h certificate that way. Bu
t we didn™t know Œ I didn™t 
know probably for close to two years. And 
in Œ the Russians told us not to move 

south with th e Po lish troops that were goi
ng, and Œ but we went. And all way there 
on 
Ferraba
(ph). where we were on this Œ on Œ on the river, and s Œ we were

was, and 
Pushkoski

the train to pick up so me bread. I never 
forget, we tied quick ly the bed Œ bread a
nd wu  Œ instead of carrying bread, we™re 
pushing it into our pants, you see, because
 we™re afraid that we™ll be hungry 
tomorrow. So we were stashing it, and we
 had bread. And then
 we went, and we 
were coming back, and we went t-too far up
 over there, and I met a woman, and I 
said, is my mother and sister
 alive? They said yes. And 
I wanted to jump on that 
train and go out to them. But 
[indecipherable]
 there is n o  way that they can feed 
me. So I went to Œ on that tr

 on 
Ca spia n

an oil tanker to go to 
Potlevy

Iran
. 
Q: Okay, we™re going to stop at that point

A: I cannot give you days, you know. 
Q: I understand. 

A: I don™t rememb er. But it wasn™t too lo
ng after, you know, we were there several 
months over there, and then we were on 
collective farm workin
g. And on collective 
farm it was a riot, because they had 
wo psha
(ph). So  you got water mixed with 
flour to eat, and they  had bread they gave you, and they had 
ch em erch ki
(ph), 
sunflower Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ seeds, so you could eat. And I reme mb
er we were picking Œ what the hell we 
were picking? Peas, I think. And the Ru
ssian girls were a b so
lutely crazy. They 
were sitting there and I was sitting separa
tely from them, and those Russian girls 
were picking that. And they said 
[speaks foreign language]
 boy, come over here. 
And I said, I don™t want to co
me. They  used  to say, don™t 
be afraid, we won™t bite it 
off, you know. There were no 
men, they were all in th
e army. Women were going 
desperate. 

Q: Don™t tell me that that™s what Œ really? 

A: Yeah. Women were desperate. Ther
e were Œ there was a girl which Œ 
Maru sha
(ph), which used to give us our bread, 
couple of slices of bread a day. She 
told me always, if you come for a night, 
I will give you more and more. They were

Œ they were desperate, you 
know, to get, and th e hell, 
I was a small boy, you know. 
I told you, I didn™t grow. And I was afraid of the women. 
Q: Poor guy. 
A: But it was something. So
 anyway, where was I now? 
Q: You were collective farm. You were Œ 
A: Yeah, in co Œ the carriage came in and 
they told us to go
 Œ get in and we™re 
going to 
NKVD
. And we came to 
NKVD
 and 
NKVD
 said, well, you are free now. 
Q: That™s the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: That was the contract which 
Siko rski
, 
Stalin
 and everything were going to fo rm 
Polish army, and there will be trains going south in 
Siberia
 and they will organize 
Polish army over there. So if you want 
to go, go. We would 
advise you not to go 
because there will be starvati
on over there. We have food
 over there. But we didn™t 
listen, and you know Œ 

Q: Well, here™s an interesting thing.
 You are deported in mid-June 1941. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And it™s one week later that Nazi 
Germany
 attacks the 
Soviet Union
, and 
breaks the 
Molo tov-Ribbentro p
 pact by attacking. So  you™re not ev en at the 
camps yet, when  Œ  

A: Oh, no. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

73
Q: Œ wh en th is attack comes. Did you find out about th is? 
A: Oh yeah. It was in ev
ery Œ on every station, th
ey had the picture of the 
[indecipherable]
 German, with the big tail a
nd big nails like this, all over 
Russia
. 
It appeared on ev ery railroad 
station. That™s why we Œ th
at™s how we found out that 
the war broke out, because they came with
 those pictures. And believe me, some of 
the people over there were asking us deep  in 
Siberia
 whether the Germans really 
looked like that. And later 
on, a lot of Germans from 
Volga
 River were taken by 
Stalin
 and sent to 
Siberia
, too. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Because during 
Catherine the Great
, a lot of Germans were settled over there. 
So the Œ they to
ok them over to 
Siberia
. 
Q: And so, you were alr
eady imprisoned wh en Nazi 
Germ any
 Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ attacks the 
Soviet Union
. And Œ 
A: And you know what our 
biggest problem was then? 
Q: What? 

A: 
America
. 
Q: Why? 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
74
A: Between the Russian. Whose side are th
ey going to be on? 
Yo u know, are they 
going to be on the side of the allies like 
Russia
 and 
England
 and 
France
, and Œ or 
are they going to  be on the side of 
Germany
? Nobody was sure. And then, th ank 
God wh en we heard, okay, Japanese bombed 
Pearl Ha rb or
 and the news came . 
Now Japanese solved the problem. They  said now
 America
 will have to go to war. 
Q: So, in  other word s, the question Œ 
A: That™s what the Œ 
Q: Œ the question was, what side will 
America
 be on? 
A: Yeah. Because you know, like 
Kennedy™s 
father, he wanted to be on German 
side, you know, a lot of Americans, they 
didn™t want to be in a war. The war Œ the 
draft in 
America
 started one day before 
Pearl Harbor
. Americans didn™t want to 
go to war, they were only selling weap
ons and recession ended, depression in 
America
 ended, because they started selling weapon, and 
America
 came out 
because of that war from depression. 
America
 was in aw ful depression. People in 
the office told me they used 
to bring fo od to people, an
d often they used to enter 
apartments in 
New York
 and people were dead already from starvation. They  told 
me this was awful starvation in 
America
 too, during the depression.

Q: So wi Œ so in 
Russia
, while you were deep in 
Siberia
, you knew that the war 
had broken out, but when the Œ you go
 to the secret police offices, th e 
NKVD
, and 
they tell you you are free. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Was that a shock? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you believe them? 
A: We knew there was a war, so
 we thought that there is 
[indecipherable]
 because 
the news was coming that there was Po
lish contacts already with Ru ssian 
government and everything. So  you Œ you knew Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ that something was 
going on, just like about 
Ka ty n
 forest. There was a news 
in 
Poland
 th at nobody knew wh at happened , but
 you see, at a period, no mo re 
letters were coming from there, an d nobody
 knew wh at happened. So  the Po les 
suspected that they 
were killed, but nobody could sa
y. And then Germans came in 
there, and when 
the Germans came, 
America
 and 
England
 said that it was made 
by the German, 
Katyn
 forest, and that the Germans 
killed, because 
they couldn™t 
insult Uncle 
Joe
. Because they were afraid that Uncle 
Joe 
will go back and join

with 
Germany
 again, maybe. You know, this wa
s very complicated, I think. We 
were afraid of many thi
ngs. People didn™t know.  
Q: So when Œ wh en you hear from the se
cret police that you are free, and they  
advise you not to leave that area, this is 
now near that village 
of Œ how did you call 
it? The rebo Œ  
A: 
Nowia Œ Nowia
(ph)
 Angoriv ka
(ph) the village was. 
Nowia
(ph)

the village was. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And they  Œ they  Œ they Œ they  were, 
you know, the only thing they  did to us 

[indecipherable]
 over there, they took our Œ our
 pictures and all our papers, you 
know, they took
 every Œ all the memories of 
Poland
, you know, where we were Œ 
were without pictures, without anything. 
Bu t they didn™t punish us, nobody did 

anything to us over there. It is Œ it™s the 
south, this problem started, because there 
was starvation over there, there was Œ 
Q: Okay. So let™s le Œ excu
se me, let™s start h ere. So you Œ you decide to leave 
anyway Œ 
A: Yeah.

with Po lish soldiers and we started moving south Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ you see, to where the Polish army  was going to be 
[indeciphera ble]
. But the 
Russians took us to 
Amudalia
(ph) river, and they put th
e civilians there, and the 
army soldiers they moved to 
Gu za ri(p h) 
where already Polish army  was being 
trained. 
Q: And you were with the civilians? 
A: They were alre Œ they were already Œ th
ey were already th ere, Poles and a lot of 
Jewish soldiers, Polish were there, and yo
u know, they  were all Œ everybody with 
Polish citizenship was released
. So the Jews were released
 too. So th -they were in 
Polish army , and then they all got down 
to  the Middle East, you know, we came to

Q: So what happened Œ 
so you were apart Œ with the civilian group? 
A: Civilian group, yeah. 

Q: Okay . What happened to you guys? Wh
at happened with you and your mo ther 
and your sister when you Œ

Russians are funny people, but they  back ed 
out. But of course, there were 80 men, 
and in 
Russia
 most of the men were draf
ted, you know, everywhere. 
Q: All right, but I™m confus
ed. And I™m confused becaus
e the Œ the Œ the juncture 
that I understand is that the military me
n are separated from the women, and they 
go off to the Œ where the Polish units are Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ and eventually they get to 
Palestine
 and Œ and are trained to fight. The 
civilians are Œ are left behind, and the Ru

A: Because I saw a lot of people being br
ought back from there, an d on barges 
there were nothing but dead
 bodies coming back from south, from the desert, and 
we Œ we were the first transport that
 could stop th e Russians and send us

beautiful old town, and 
Farraba
(ph) wasn™t that nice. Can you imagine, there was 
a huge river there, and I think now, there 
mu st have been fish in there, but nobody 
had the string to catch them. There must 
have been food there in the river, but 
nobody was fishing. I rememb
er some soldiers were ther
e, sometimes sitting Œ and 
I remember soldiers sitting 
by the water, and they were 
killing lice. And one soldier 
says, oh, you are from this region of 
Russia
. He says, oh, how do you know th at 
I™m from th ere? The kind of lice that you 
have on you. People 
were covered with

lice, because when you are starve, you

A: Thirteen of us in the evening, three 
in the morning only left
. And they had food. 
They were commissar™s
 wife somewhere in 
Moscow
, or something, and they had 
food and everything, and they fed me. If they didn™t feed me in the hospital, I 

would have died, because there was no food. 
I was Œ I Œ I was there in the hospital 
and I was covered with  bedbugs and ev er
ything. It was filthy. And the Russians 
were nice doctors, they tried to do someth
ing, there was a woma

one dog running around th at 
place, and everybody was 
trying to  catch him, but 
nobody could catch the dog. So, you kn
ow, and it was various; sometimes we got 
onions, so fo r a couple of weeks we ate oni
ons. Then we went, something else we 
got, you know. Wh atev er we came, we cooked. But somebody caught that dog 
somewhere and brought us some meat 
after I had pneumonia. And we were 
cooking and cooking that meat, I didn™t want
 to eat it. I didn™t want to eat the dog, 
but they  made me eat it, and I think th
at™s what I regain strength. Because I 
couldn™t walk, I was so weak. There was a 
step, I couldn™t stand on the step, arise 
myself. It  was Œ it was Œ it was 
koszmar
 in Polish, we say, you know, this is Œ 
Q: It was a nightmare. 
A: A nightmare, nightmare, period, y
ou know. People were dying. Can you 
imagine being in  a room in a hospital and 10 
kids die at one night. You just become 
inhuman, you start losing humanity, 
you know, when you live under those 
condition. Because there was no Œ there wa
s no help. And eventu
ally my mother 
gave me Œ and there were 
about seven or eight of us
 from that place, Polish 
children, my mother gave me to take me 
to Polish army , becaus
e they promise that 
they will give us food. 
And we were writing, and

document, and we were going with Ru ssian
 soldiers. And we were being fed well,

was awful thing. 
And then we went to a Œ a collective farm 
[indecipherable]
 there were Muslims 
living over there, and they

going to 
Iran

Iran
 was, I didn™t know what 
Teheran
 
is. You know, I had a friend, and we were 
both sick, we had diarrhea, but we told 

them we don™t have diarrhea. In the evenin
g they told  us to bring bread, so we 
stacked all the bread in the 
pants to make sure that we™ll have something to eat. 
You know what a great thing it is when
 you are hungry, and you got bread? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But I Œ I omitted something Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ about the dreams t-to say. I say thos

before I got pneumonia in 
Russia
, I was dreaming that I have mouth full of bread 
and I couldn™t eat it. I couldn™t swallow it.
 And ab out two, three days later I had 
pneumonia and I was in a 
hospital. Then I came to 
Teheran

go to  hospital. Why? He says, I had the

Next day amoebic dysentery.

A: The same dream that I cannot swallow th e bread. I don™t know. I™m saying it 
because I cannot explain it. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But the same dream that

Q: So, there was something I 
wanted to ask you before Œ 
before I forget. And that 
was, when your father le Œ when  you last
 saw your father at the train station in 
Wilno
, in nov Œ 
A: 
Nowa  Vileka
(ph) 
Q: 
Nowa  Vileka
(ph), and he said to you, 
never show your tears. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: You started to relate a story to me late
r where that came into
 great value for you, 
that is, you followed his advice. Tell me  a
bout that incident, when  you were in 
trouble, and could have 
gotten into  mo re trouble,
 and what happened then. 
A: Well, my father exactly told me 
[speaks foreign la nguage]
 
Russia
 doesn™t 
show Œ like tears, never show th em you™re 
afraid, and you™ll be all right. And when  
we were in 
Ferraba
(ph), we di-didn™t have any co al 
or anything, to heat the house. 
And next to the railroad, there was a lot 
of coal lying, old coal, you know, but it 

was par Œ powder, so it was useless. But if
 you dug in it, you could get pieces of 
coal. So it was very cold, my
 Œ my s Œ my sister was si
ck. We had the little place, 
you know, where to make fire
 in the room. And I was there, and there was, I think, 
a Russian woman or a Russian boy and a 
Mongol wo man, I don™t rememb er how

many, you know. There were three of us, we
 were digging, digg
ing, and suddenly, 
police came, you know, and Œ 
Q: The police came, yeah. 
A: Œ they  Œ they grabbed us. So  I took 
the bag from the bottom,
 and I threw all the 
coal out on the ground, they didn™t. And they
 took us to police statio n, and in police 
station they put us ag ainst the wall, and 
stand here. And we didn™t know why we 
had to stand. And I was standing, standing
, and after the while Œ they had a sofa 
there, and magazine Œ I said, I wa
nt to see magazines. They said 
[speaks foreign 
la ng ua g e ]
, you have dirty hands. And I 
had a little fur coat, you know, from 
[indecipherable]
. I clean my hands, and I said, my
 hands are clean. So they  gave 
me a magazine to look. I couldn™t read 
Russian, but I was looking at the pictures, 
you know. And then  I told them, well, yo
u know, it™s very uncomfortable standing 
against the wall and looking at the magazine, 
I want to sit down. And they said, sit 
down . And then came the chief of police, 
wh atever he was, I don™t know wh at, he 
was 
NKVD
 probably. And he started screami
ng, and he screams at me, where do 
you live? I say 
bia
e domy
. So  wh at do you Œ just 
because you live in white 
houses, you think you can stea
l? I said well, I need heat
 and I don™t have heat. And 
he started screaming at me like hell. And I looked at him and I said 
[speaks 
fo reig n  lang uag e
] I don™t know wh ere my  father is
, you to ok my  father away. We

have no fo od, we have no heat, my  
sister  is sic k . You took us to 
Siberia
, I don™t 
know wh ere I am and everything. You shoot
 me! And he looked 
at me like stu p id 
man, and he say, go home. And those two we
nt to jail. And he told me Œ and this 
was what my father told me, 
don™t show them that you are 
afraid. I told him, that™s 
Œ you want to shoot me, shoot me. You ca
nnot do anything to me any mo re. Says, 
go home. 
Q: And you were how old at that point? 
A: About 14. I told them that
 and then Œ nothing. And my  father always told  me Œ I 
remember Cuban fiasco, when
 Khru shch ev  
came with the rockets here, 
reme mb er? 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And at my desk in research de
partment, I had write
rs and I Œ I had 
Do w J o nes
 
tape. And that was how we were ge
tting all the news during the day. 
Q: Right. 
A: Be-Because I needed to re
ad all the time everything, 
check it, because I was in 
research. And a bunch of Amer
icans, partners came, and th
ey were all millionaires, 
you know. And they were re
ading there, and what will 
happen with all that stuff. 
And I was sitting on my desk, you know, I put
 the Œ on the leg, and I said, now I 
saw everything, but I never thought I would see a bunch of American millionaires

afraid of a Russian peasant. They walked 
away like you cannot 
imagine. I told Œ I 
told them, I never thought I would see a bunc
h of American millionaires scared of a 
Russian peasant. Because 
Khrush chev
 was a very nice man. You know how he got 
found out? 
Q: How? 

A: I don™t know. He and 
Eisenhower
 hit it o ff very well, 
Khrushch ev
 and 
Eisenhower
, they were both grandfathers, and si
 Œ gri Œ they were going to go to  
Paris
, and meet in 
Paris
 later on, and start talking ab
out breaking up e-everything. 
And the trouble was that 
Eisenhower
 gave order to the army  not to fly 
U
-
2
 planes 
over 
Russia
, because we were flying 
U-2 
planes, you know, over 
Russia
, and 
Eisenhower 
ordered to  stop before that f
light. Now, what happened in 
Russia
, I 
don™t know, but the American army  has 
some excuse t o  do
 something in case 
something happens, and they flew over 
Russia
, and of course the Russians Œ 
Eisenhower
 was told by 
America
 that Russians can shoot 
U-2
 any time they want. 
That™s not 
[indecipherable]
 they have the rocket, and they shot 
U-2 
with this pilot 
Power
, American 
Power
. Now, he was supposed to bl
ow himself up, but he didn™t. 
And 
Eisenhower
 said, we are not flying over 
Russia
. And all of a sudden  
Russia 
shows them 
Power
, and they show them 
U-2
 plane. And in 
Russia
, they broke off 
talking, and 
Khrushchev
 couldn™t meet with 
Eisenhower 
any mo re. And the

92
whole 
[indecipherable]
 breakthrough with 
Russia
, with 
K h ru sh ch ev
 was 
finished. Both by Russian m
ilitary , because they didn™t want peace, and American 
military, because
 they send 
U-2
. So , you know, you cannot trust anybody. 
Q: Right. 
A: You cannot trust an
ybody, because the Œ 
Kennedy 
fix the Œ th is, see, but it was 
very simple. He withdrew Russian 
Œ American rocket
s and bombs from 
Turkey
, 
and 
Khrush chev
 withdrew them 
from this Œ from 
Cuba
, and everything was 
settled.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. Let™s go back  to Œ let™s go back to 
Fera  Œ Ferraba
(ph), is that 
where you were arrested by this 
NKVD
 Œ oh no, by the po
lice, for stealing. 
A: I don™t know whether this was 
NKVD
 or police Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ but stealing, you know, stealing go
vernment coal. And that was not coal 
actually, powder Œ 
Q: No, it was just powder. 
A: Œ but Œ but they  let me go becaus
e they noticed that I™m not afraid. 

Q: Yeah. Were you already released
 by then, or were you still in Œ  
A: No, we were released already.

Q: Okay . 

A: That was after we came from that village, you know? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And they  Œ and I was released, but 
you see, you could Œ thi-th is was so 
important, I think later on, when we were tr
aveling with those 80
 Polish soldiers Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and this Polish guy that said that he™s Œ 
Q: An officer. 

A: Œ this officer, and he showed  them he
 was not afraid, and they  backed down 
every time, every time, they
 backed down . They never 
made a friend, you know, 
something to  restrict him, or some thing. 
They were afraid. They
 load  people on the 
boats to send them on 
Amu Darya
 river, he goes and unload s the boats 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And they  Œ they  backed out. So  it™s 
a Œ it™s a very funny psychology of that 
country.

A: Yeah, because they Œ they said that 
they will feed us, yo
u know. They were 
driving raise the children. Everywhere, all 
over the world they were trying to  save 
children, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And we were over th ere, and they 
gave us some food, and ev erything. 
Q: And this is this man with th
e 80 soldiers, I forget his name. 
A: Oh, I don™t know what
 happened to him.  
Q: Okay . 

A: He Œ he went after that from 
Ferraba
(ph), where we were. They didn™t send any 
mo re people on the boats, 
and I don™t know what happen
ed. I understand that he 
was tried later Œ 
Q: I see.

Q: Oh, I see. 
A: Œ for pretending that he™s an offi
cer. That™s stupidity. You see how stupid 
people are? He was pretending to be 
an officer, and he wasn™t an officer. 
Supposedly he took some money somewh
ere. Who knows, you know, you don™t 
know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But it was something. Bu
t it was lucky that eventually we were taken to 
Teheran
. 
Q: Okay, so tell me ab out that ver Œ that

A: Yeah, and then Œ 

Q: Œ how do you get to

[indecipherable]
 I was with mine boy 
Puskotski

to bring fo od supplies, I put Œ 
Q: The bread. 
A: Œ bread in my  pants, hiding as mu ch 
as I could. And th en they  put us on the 
train. And we came to ma Œ 
Paklevy
(ph). It took two days to cross 
Novotsk
(ph). 
There was very little water, lines and lines
 of people to get water, you know. And 
some Polish soldiers are troopers, and they  
told us, bring some vodka for us. But I 
never went, but they  were giving Œ and 
the Russians told us, if we catch anybody 
entering on the ship with Ru
ssian money, you go back to 
Siberia
. So you know, 
there were bags filled in, and there weretwo kinds of rubles. 
There were ordinary 
rubles and 
Chervonsa
. 
Chervonsa
 were the money th at could use in 
Iran
, actually 
buy something. 

Q: So in  other word s, it was convertible. It was convertib le currency. 

A: Yeah, yeah, it must have 
been convertible. You see, 
I don™t understand at that 
time, but I mu st have had some, becaus
e when we came to over there, to 
Paklevy
(ph), they were talking in Russian a 
lot. You know, the 
Persians knew how 
to speak Russians, and they were selling 
varenyye yaytsa
, boiled eggs. But 
varen yye
 to us in Polish it says 
like crow™s eggs, because those eggs were so small, 
but they  were cooked. 
So we were Œ I and 
Puskotski
(ph), we were throwing out 
the whites and we were only eating the yello
w one, to plug up fo
r diarrhea, because 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski

97
we were running to  the toilet all the tim
e, you know. But on that ship  wh en we 
were, I told you, we were on the front an d the whole front of the ship, there were 
Polish Jews. And there was no water, and 
they only gave us herrings to eat 
[indecipherable]
. So we were all day lining with
 little cups, because there was one 
faucet by the captain™s, you know, deck, and we were carrying water to those 

people, it was awful. And once we came ther
e, they threw at us, dates. Po-Polish 
soldiers were on 
[indecipherable]
 and they came Œ the ship
 was too big to go out, 
and there was a storm. So they came Œ I 
didn™t want to eat dates ever, you know, 
after that, b ecause we ate so man y  dates,
 we were hungry. And then they took us 

off that ship, and the next day 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t remember what happened, 
they drove us to tur Œ to 
Paklevy
(ph), and I saw stores with
 meat, w ith bread, with 
everything. I was sure it™s propaganda. 
I said, it™s impossible. I wouldn™t Œ I 
couldn™t believe that somebody has bread 
and food and meat in this store. We 

didn™t believe it, you know? It™s Œ you ge
t so brainwashed, y
ou know, it™s so e asy. 
And then they shaved us, th
ey cut our hair and I don™t 
know what the hell they did 
with us. The next day they put us 
in the trucks and we went south Œ

A: I Œ they were mixed up. Th
ey were Poles, they were Br

lice Œ 

Q: I see. 

A: Œ away from us, you know, because from 
Russia
 we came with lice, so they 
were shaving us and everything. So ev eryb
ody lo oked  like no hair or anything. I Œ I 
fell up. We went to 
[indecipherable]
 place for one night. Next time and next thing 
was 
Teheran
. And over there I was going at night, and I fell down and it was 
toilets that were overflowing. And I wa
s in those Russian quilted suits, you know, I 
had. So  stink was unbelievable, and two ladi
es came to me in 
Polish, and they say 
[speaks foreign language]
 You™re so poor, you know. Th
ey didn™t know that I was 
a boy. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And next day they  put us in, and we came to

And in that camp they took all our
 clothes away, and the British were 
[indecipherable]
 they were burning shoes, wa Œ ev
erything th at he had, blankets. 
And we found with this boy, that in a to

fficer came and we 
ask him whether he could go 
outside of that camp and br
ing us some fruits. And he 
said, boys, it costs money. They  say, ho
w much do you want? His eyes almost 
rolled over how much. But th
en  I had that stupid dream again, with th e bread. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The next day I went to the hospital. 
Of course, I don™t know what happened to 
my  money. Nobody knew what my  name was,
 and how long I was in the hospital, I 
don™t know 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did you have any documents at
 all? Any papers with you? 

A: Nothing. We Œ from 
Russia 
we came with absolutely 
nothing. Some people had 
some papers, we had nothing. I didn™t 
have anything. Because, you see, in 
Wilno
, 
Nowa Vileka
(ph), they  took all our documents, so whatever we had Po lish, and 
they confiscated. When we came to 
Siber-Siberia 
over there, they started 
screaming at us 
[speaks foreign lang uage]
, where are you docu

you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You lying and ev erything, and the 
NKVD
 wanted our documents, and we said,

those Russians the same way. And they say

T h -T h-T h -T h ey ™ re p e cu liar

A: Noth ing. Nothing. 

Q: Œ being released? Nothing?

communicate with the English, she could 
communicate with Fren

Lady 
[indecipherable]
 the governor™s wife over th

making Polish bibles for us, I still have
 them, over there. And my sister was 
correcting, because th

Q: The type, mm-hm. 

A: And she she used to invite us, you 
know. Well, my God, it was palaces where 
the British live, like governor. In the desert
, she had garments a
nd beautiful things 
and servant. The British live like kings, y
ou know. But that™s why, of the English 
language, that™s why my mother asked the 
British to put me in 
English school, and 
they send me to Ca-Catholic school in 
Kara chi
, and I was studying over there right 
away, starting to  learn English. So, and late Œ

when they were traveling through those 
mountains from 
Paklevy
(ph )  to  
Tehera n
, they closed all th
e windows somewhere, 
because people were afraid. You are wa
y, way up on the mountain. You look 
straight down and you see bus
es and trucks and ev erythi
ng, destroyed, lying, cars 
that fell down. Nobody bother
ed to fix it even. You know
, nobody looked for it. It 
was a scary like hell. And you

oke hashish or something, 
too, and they were driving with their legs
 often, and wh en th
ey were coming to a 
turn, they  didn™t slow down , 
but they used to blow th

experience, you were scared
 like hell going with them. 
Q: So you were

A: No, it was a truck. 

Q: No, on a truck, it was a truck.

A: A truck. Yeah, but what you saw, 
you know, everything 
down there, it was 
military trucks, what Persians were dr
iving them. It was Œ and sometimes you 
stopped somewhere, and th er
e would be a place, like a coffee place, and they  had 
donkeys walking, and beautif
ul carpets lying, and this
 Œ donkeys over there, and 
the horses over there, and 
[indecipherable]
 walking everything. Bu t beautiful 
Persian rugs, you know, lying over there. 
And you could have

Q: Well, so was this after you got better? I mean, you Œ when  you Œ yeah.

A: Œ I came down with typhoid. 
Q: I see. 

A: With that thing, I don™t know how 
lo ng I was there, and nobody knew who I 
was, and I think when I b
ecame conscious, I saw that some boys are getting some 
money. So I asked them, what was it?
 They said, we joined the Polish 
[indecipherable]
 there was like army  school  
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ 
[indecipherable]

So I told them I join

didn™t know what to do with
 me. So they loaded
 me with the Œ w
ith some boys, and 
they said, you going to 
Palestine
. But they  didn™t know my  name, and my  mo th er, 
when she came, she co uldn™t find me anyw
here when she came over there. And it 
was very nice, we were drivin
g Œ this road wasn™t so bad, going that way. The only 
thing, the minute we left 
Iran
, we came to desert already, and Polish army 
surrounded us, guard s around us, and they  
said, boys, you don™t go anywhere. Two 
of you were already kidnapp
ed by the people over he
re. So you Œ you don™t go 
anywhere, just stay over there, because 
it™s a very dangerous place. That was 
Iraq
. 
And he to ld us, you don™t move anywhere, 
we are going to be guarded by soldiers. 
And they guarded us like he
ll til they brought us to 
Palestine
. 
Q: Mm-hm. And then Œ 
A: We went through 
Ba ghdad
, I remember, and th
en we came to 
Palestine
 and in 
Palestine
 the Jews were throwing apples an
d grape Œ not apples, but oranges, 
grapefruits at us and ev erything. And they  spoke Po lish everywhere, and they  
brought us to 
Bash keet
(ph) the camp, where was for th
e boys. And we were in that 
Bashkeet
(ph), they had the school over there. 
Q: What was the name of the place? 

A:

A: It™s right next to 
Gedera
. 
Gedera
 is a Œ a town  that is on th e map Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ i-in 
Israel
. It was right to 
Gedera
. And there, there were several hills we had. 
And one hill Œ on each hill the British 
built already this how do you call it? 
Showers and things like this. And over ther
e felt that there was a Arab village. And 

we were ordered with  a stick to guard th
at property, so nobody can come there. 
And they were standing there, and we™re 
standing at Œ one boy was standing guard 
over there, and co uple of Arabs were 
coming on a donkey, and he tried to stop 
them with a bamboo stick. Well, they sta
bbed him, and the next boy that was, he 
saw it, so he screamed. So it went Œ my G
od, there were about 1200, I think, of us, 
because they used to sa
y that it is the battalion 
[indecipherable]
 1,200. And we all 
grabbed stones and we st
arted running towards the Arabs. And from the Arab 
village, Arabs started running. An
d Œ but the camp commander called 
Gedera
, and 
from 
Gedera
 came
 tanketki
, you know, th e open tanks Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ with  machine guns, and across the dese
rt we saw the Polish so ldiers going like 
hell at those Arabs, a day™s run back to  their village right away. Otherwise, 
probably a lot of us would have gotte
n killed. But it was dangerous, it was a 
dangerous place. You had to be very carefu
l. There were some Œ so finally Arab

boys used to  come and feel your pockets.
 And if you were going somewhere on the 
finger, the truck would slow down and you gr
ab, and you had to ju mp  in the truck. 
So while you were jumping, 
once you hold the truck, y
ou couldn™t let go, because 
you would fall down, and they  emptied y
our pockets, steal everything. Bu t o-over 
there it was nice because everybody s-sp
oke Polish, you know, everywhere. But 
one time in Œ 
Q: What was the purpose of this camp, 
and what were the kinds of activities y ou 
did there? 

A: Oh, we Œ well, school. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And we had wonderful 
professors, because the schools mo stly were Polish 
university professors from 
Poland
 that were deported to 
Russia
 and in stead of 
putting them in the army regul
ar, they brought them to 
that school. Because there 
was first grade, second, third, f
ourth, you know. It was gymnasium. 
Q: But here™s a question I™ve got; tell me if
 I™m wrong in this, my  assump tion, from 
what I had read, is that when 
Sikorski
 made this agreement with 
Stalin
 in 1941, 
that the deportees from 
Poland
, who had been  deported both from 
Poland
 in 1940, 
and from the 
Wilno 
region, which was then 
Lithuania
 in 1941, were released. And 
so Polish deportees across the 
Soviet Unio n
, and throughout all of the gulags, were

now free. However, only thos
e who could ha
ve military activity, that is, those who 
were young men who were fit to fight, would be allowed to leave the 
Soviet 
Unio n
. 
A: Oh no, everybody.  
Q: So th at is women and ch ildren could leave as well? 

A: Women and ch ildren, everybody could leave 
Russia
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Everybody was allowed to leave.
 This was thing, but th en when  
Katy n 
mu rd er 
came in, nobody could leave already. 
Q: Oh, I see. So, until the Œ 
until the Germans unearthed Œ 
A: Unearthed that 
Katy n Œ 

Q: 
Katy n
 Œ 
A: Œ and they announce it, 
America
, and 
England
 said it was done by the 
Germans, and 
Stalin
 
[indeciphera ble]
 the exploitation, and he had Polish Jewish 
fellow wh o was a general, what was his Œ and he formed communist army  in 

Poland
, and that was another army  over ther
e. And they went all the way to 
Berlin
, 
too, with Russian army. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
108
A: They organized Polish so
ldiers, and they put them 
into that army. Wha-What 
was called? 
Zi e m i r s k i
(ph) I think was 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So then he™s Œ 
A: Œ but he Œ he was a communist, that fello
w. They knew that he was, but he was 
a general in Polish army , and he co mmande
d that army , and he
 got Poles into 
Battle of 
Lenino
, and Poles were slaughtered by th
e Germans over there. But they 
were Œ 

Q: The Battle of 
Lenino
? 
A: 
Lenino
, so mew h ere in  
Russia
, and a lot of Poles were slaughtered, but they 
went all the way to 
Berlin
, because I have seen pictures from 
Poland
, of Polish, 
with Po lish flag on bra Œ on 
Brandenburg
 back gate, Po lish flags were hanging 
over there, too. 
Q: Well, so this Œ what did you say his name was? Zhir Œ general Œ 

A: Wait, wait, let me tell you. 
You see, this is something. 
Zi e m i r s k i
(ph), I think, 
Zi e m i r s k i
(ph). 
Q: 
Zi e m i r s k i
(ph). So that means that if 
you had been a deportee to the 
Soviet 
Unio n
, and then you are released, and you didn™t make it out of the 
Soviet Unio n 
before the news about 
Katy n
 broke. 
A: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
109
Q: So you are still released fro
m the gulags, but on th is case Œ 
A: Oh, it was very tricky. Let me tell 
you what happened, because I met some Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ people, I cannot talk about. Bu t 
I know of the people who I knew. The 
Russians told them, either you take Russi
an citizenship, or we send you back to 
gulag . 
Q: Okay . 
A: You see, after it, th ey were already released, they said 
[indecipherable]
. So the 
people who took Russian passports were
 later not allowed to go back to 
Poland
. 
They  didn™t want them to go back  to 
Poland
. It was very difficult, and the rest Œ 
and they put a lot into th
e army. The people were willi
ng to go into Polish army, 
soldiers, of course, you know, because th
ey prefer that th en something else. 
Q: So, in  other word s, they could have 
been Œ this is what I was getting to. 
A: Yeah, but Œ 

Q: Some of these could have gone into that General 
Zi emirski™s
 army  who had 
come from the gul
ags themselves.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Is that so? 
A: Well Œ 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
110
Q: Okay . There was Œ let™s say you™re
 a Polish deportee, like you were from 
Wilno
 
or Œ or some other region of the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop
 pact area, and you™re 
released in 1941, or the news comes in
 1941 th at you can be released. You are 
released, and then with 
the German advances, the 
Katy n
 massa cre i s  discovered, 
and the border closes to 
Iran
 and you no lo nger can go Œ 
A: No, 
Stalin
 said no more. He Œ he Œ 
Q: 
Stalin 
says no mo re. 
A: Œ broke off relation with Po lish government in 
Lo ndo n
 right away, 
Stalin
. 
Q: Okay , so Œ 
A: Because the Poles said, you did it. Th
ere were Americans brought, the Germans 
shot them, they knew it, but the Am
ericans w ere petrified of losing 
Russia
, because 
they were Œ they did the Œ 90 perc
ent of fighting with the Germans Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ you know, so Œ 
Q: So here™s Œ so here™s my question; if 
you were then free, but
 no longer in the 
gulags, as a former deportee, and you™re 
a Polish citizen, you th
en have the option 
of joining th is new Po lish army . 

A: Polish army. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
111
Q: And so it could be that Œ that many form
er gulag prisoners were in that army. Is 
that so? 
A: Let me tell you something. From what I understand, 
Poland
 had the fifth largest 
army  during the second Wo rld War. What was under rations, and wh at was in 

England
. In 
England
 were about 200,000 Poles. P
ilots with parachute troops, 
tanks and everything, under British command.
 And then there was another part of 
the army over on the Russian
 side. So the Poles fought
 everywhere. They were 
bleeding like crazy for Œ for 
[indecipherable]
 for yours and for ours, what turned 
out it was for yours only, not for ours. 

Q: Yeah. So  Œ okay. Ho w is it that your
 mo ther made it out, and your sister? 
A: They must have left Œ I 
left very early, you know Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ and Œ and they were a little later, be
cause they eventually came to that place 
where I was in 
Guza ri
(ph), and from there, they went to 
Teheran
. 
Q: Okay . 

A: In 
Teheran
, my mother spoke English, so sh
e was interpreter, and then there 
was governor of southeastern 
Iran
, came over to Polish embassy, and he said, I 
want to westernize my  house. Can you 
give me somebody who speaks French and 
English and try to 
[indecipherable]
 westernize my  home, because his wife spoke

112
only English. And my  mo ther was sent ther
e. She said, she gets in a car, he bought 
them beautiful suits and everything, you 
know, employed them. And they get in the 
car, and there are machine guns lying, 
and ev erything, there are two cars. You 
know, my  mo ther said, what is this? 
Why, we™re going through the mountains, 
there are bandits over there.
 So my mother says, well 
what Œ what do you mean? 
What happens? Well, whoever 
shoots better, wins. If they shoot at us, we will shoot 
back at them. And th
is was traveling to 
Teheran
 through the mo untains. And 
eventually th
ey went to 
Za h e d a n
, and they were there in 
Za h e d a n
, and there was 
there a Persian general 
Kava
(ph )  
Kavush ek
(ph), who spoke very well Russian. 
And they helped them, you 
know, eventually to
 go back. My mo
ther said it was 
impossible to do. He was giving one dir
ection, she was giving another direction. 
They  have a dinner ready, she goes and sh
e prays Muslim prayers for two hours, 
they cannot serve it. M y  moth
er said they Œ she gave 
up, and she went back to  
Teheran
. And in 
Teheran
 she was working all the tim
e, taking transports to 
southern pers Œ t-to southern  
Persia
, you know, to go to 
Africa
, or to 
Australia
 or 
somewhere. And they were busy all the time. 
Q: And you, in the meanwhile were in 
Palestine
.  
A: I was in 
Palestine
 and I was writing letters to a
ll the camps that I hear that 
Polish people are. And my mother was writin
g letters, and we hit. I got a letter, and

113
my Œ and my mother™s let Œ and my letter 
c a me to  my  mo th er. An
d in school they 
knew who I was already, because the name, and sh e was writing for 
Stanislav 
Kiersnowski
, and I got a letter and I found out 
th at my  mo th er an d my  siste r  i s 
alive, that they are in 
Teheran
. That took a long time, 
I cannot tell you how long it 
was, and then my mother wrote to the 
camp commander a letter, telling him that 
my father died in 
Russia
. She didn™t write it to me. 
And that letter Œ  censor was Œ 
mixed up the letters, sent a letter to me
, one to the camp commander. And the letter 
with the Œ my father™s d
eath came to me in the letter, because all th e letter was 
censored during the war. So 
somehow the letters got transferred, and then I found 
out my father is dead. I knew very
 little, you know. I came to a company 
commander. I even have his picture here, 
in the Œ in the company where I was, 
because it was Œ you know, but this was fo
r boys. And I told him that my father 
died, and he said, I was w
ith your father, my God 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know 
whether you know any Polish 
[indecipherable]
 you know? 
Q: No. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 was like very happy fellow. He says, you know, your father 
kept us all alive because he kept singing 
all the time. He was joking all the time, 
and he said, one trouble was Œ and this is
 sad for me to tell. There was Œ first a 

Russian commander was in that camp. They 
told me Œ everybody 
told me that my

114
father had no hand, so he couldn™t work, 
so th ey made him a night watchman. And 
a Jewish man came to be the camp commande
r, and he was the son of a bitch, he 
removed my father from rations, from food. He said 
[speaks foreign lang uage]
, 
you don™t work , you don™t eat.
 So my father was living on 
what other soldiers were 
bringing him, pieces o f potatoes, pieces 
of bread, and things like this. And my 
father was always saying th at in life you 
can™t deny tw o things; that you™ll be in 
jail, and you di Œ you will 
be a beggar. And he was like a beggar at the end. But 
they said that he used to sing so  beautif
ully. He kept our spirits up, your father. 
And here was, you know, the com-comp any commander. 

Q: So tell me, how was it that he died? 
A: Hm? 
Q: What age Œ how did he die? Wh at
 Œ wh at happened
 to your father? 
A: I don™t know whether he died of ty
phus, or Œ or wh ether he got poisoned, 
because he vrai Œ if he ate mutton meat, he
 would have been d
ead if they didn™t 
know what to do. 

Q: Okay, cause he was allergic to  it. 

A: Because he used to stiffen up. 
Q: Okay . 
A: He used to completely Œ

115
Q: He couldn™t eat lamb . 
A: He couldn™t eat lamb, he was so allergic
 to it, that Œ and he died, so th Œ in 
papers it™s written that he had typhus, you 
know, but they said that he died very 
fast. When you think of all of these Œ all 
the things it could have been , and turned 

out opposite. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And then  when we found about 
Teheran
 and ev erything, oh my  God, the 
conferences. When no Polish people wanted
 to believe my moth
er about, because 
Polish people didn™t know ab out 
Tehera n
 conference, what was in there. 
Q: So how did your mo ther know? 
A: Well, she Œ she went in there, and 
sp oke English, and American intelligence 
officer in that hotel came to my  mo th
er, where are you going after the war? And 
my mother said well, I hope
 we are going return to 
Poland
. He says, you can™t.
 
Stalin 
a-and 
[indecipherable]
 just made a d eal, 
Poland
 goes to 
Russia
. So better 
go so mewhere else. And so  we told all th
e Polish people what™s 
going on, none of 
them wanted to believe it. But it from Œ my
 mother got it from an
 officer. I told you 
that the difference was that she knew 
languages, she could contact people. I 
remember when she came in 
Karachi
 she said she came to 
the camp, and she went 
to see the camp commander, and he was s
itting with his legs on 
the table, and my

mo ther walked in. When I walk in  a room
, please take your feet down and put them 
on the floor, she told the British 
camp commander. And she had guts. 
Q: She had guts. 
A: From then on, he was so polite, and he
 right away knew th at he has to do 
something else with her other thing. Bu
t you couldn™t do mu
ch with the Polish 
people, because they were all talking ab
out democracy. There was an old woman, 
friend of ours, and we had 
only a bench, a table and a 
bed, you know. And she Œ 
my mother went to ask him for a chair fo
r her, easy chair, you know, to sit down. 
Well, he got my Œ for that woman 
Parneechee
(ph)
 Lesker
(ph), a easy chair. My 
God, there was almost a riot in the camp
 by Po lish people. What is this? What is 
this? We™re a democracy and you give somebo
dy an easy chair to
 sit. They were 
jealous. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And they were so jealous when we were
 traveling first class wherever we were 
going, when  Œ on th e ship, you know, beca
use of being an interpreter. And th en 
when we were coming in to 
India
, when we were, there was a horseman, British 
Indian colonel. And my mother ask him 
why do you serve in 
British army? And he 
says, well, we have to learn how to figh
t. Otherwise, the British never get out from 
India
. He says, we are going to  
war to learn how to fight. 
Ah, that was somethi ng.

117
Q: So, okay. Let™s go back 
then and try a little bit chro
nologically. You™re in the 
camp, and you learn of your father™s d
eath through this misd
irected  letter that 
didn™t get to the camp commandant. And 
your mo ther finds out where you were. 
How do you meet?  
A: Well, my mother knew General 
Anders
(ph), the commander of Polish troops in 
the Middle East, because 
he used to come to 
Rudakow
(ph) when  she was young. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And for practice over there on Œ on th
e Œ on the farming, you know, they  had 
this huge farm and he came there twice.
 So my mother wrote a letter to him, 
whether it™s better to leave me in 
this military school, high school in 
Palestine
, or 
to go to civilian life. A nd he never an
swer my mother, but 
the order came from 
him, to put me on medical commi ssi
on, discharge me and send me to 
Teheran
. So 
they discharged me and they send me to 
Teheran
. And I came, and finally I met 
my  mo ther, and I was shocked. I was so shocked, because when  I was in 
Russia
, I 
was like this, and I looked at
 my  mo th er an d my  siste r  
like this. And I came back 
from 
Palestine
, I look, here™s my  mo ther and here™s
 my  sister. I grew up so much. I 
was so shaken up, becau
se my mother wasn™t big, and my sister wasn™t big, and I 
reme mb er t h em so  mu ch  b i gg

 I cannot really tell you exactly.  
Q: Okay .

then once we came to 
India
, when I went to Œ

Teheran
 then. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And what was your next 
move and where did you go 
with Œ with everybody, 
that is, your mother Œ 
A: Well, the next move was to

I came over and it was eighth grade. Bu t I 
only was three months, and I passed exams 
for three grades, for ei-eig hth grade, 

you see, because I Œ I went from seven to
 eight, but only for three months. And I 
figured out I don™t want to start eighth gr

floor, so sometimes at night we woke up,

English. And he wrote that we have a ne

leaps and bounds. I never forget he wrote to

 was operating in  
Poland
 
and ev erything, you know. He was saving peop
le. He said that Œ he Œ he told  me 
that one time he was in 
Lwów
, and th e orphanages in town  had no food. And he 
said, I knew the governor of that province from 
Germany
 when I was ambassador. 
And he said in the German 
[indecipherable]
 says, I have no food. I cannot Œ we 
need food for our army. What
 can I do for you? He says, 
I can give you some cars. 
You go to the villages. And if the village
rs give you food, y
ou can bring in and 
give it to the children, to feed them. And 
he said, I™ll make some cars available so 
you can go in the countryside 
and look for food to feed
 your ch ildren. You know, 
they were reasonable people, too. They  sa
id, we do Œ we don™t have food. Because 
he told them that the or
phan, she has no fo od in 
Lwów
. And he said well Œ and he 
said 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So what was his 
role then in Œ in 
Poland 
during the war? If he had once been 
ambassador to 
Germany
 for Œ from 
Poland 
Œ 
A: Yeah. Well, I tell you what, I canno
t tell you what, but he was Œ there was 
RGO

Poland
 called 
RGO
. And they  got money from

Hoover
, President
 Hoover
. He knew President 
Hoover
, obviously, and President
 
Hoover
 gave him the money. 
Q: This would be in the early 30s. 
A: Oh, th at was Œ yeah, early 30s.  
Q: Okay . 

A: First World War, you know, and after 
first World War and everything, maybe 
he knew him from there, I don™t know, he 
told  me, you know, he was an old man, 
but he told me those stories. 

Q: Can you Œ okay. Cut Œ cut for a second. 

A: My life, and what I heard, you know. 
Q: Yeah. I guess I just Œ 
A: I-I really don™t know how he was related to me. 

Q: Okay . 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 the writer of this I knew, that he was 
[indecipherable]
 you 
know, but Œ and how he was connected. Bu
t him I didn™t know, but I had to Œ he 

told me I had to call him 
Wilko
(ph), so it™s an uncle. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And he s Œ he was related throug
h some wedding, or to something.

A: You are still young, and you don™t Œ 
Q: Oh, don™t I like that, ha, ha. I™m on the other side of 50, let me tell you. 

A: Yeah, that™s all right, you don™t lo
ok 50. People who are nice to me Œ 
Q: I™m closer to 60. 

A: People who Œ so me people tell me, w
hy you don™t look so  ol
d, you lo ok like 70. 
I said thank you. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But 70, I could s Œ 
[break] 
Q: Okay, so my interest was, 
why I have a question about Mr. 
Ro nniker
(ph) is 
this, if he was a pre-war diplomat to 
Germany
 from 
Poland
, how is it that he even 
had any position at all 
during th e war years in 
Poland
? 
A: Because of 
Hoover
. 
 
Q: Ah, I see. 
A: 
America
. 
Q: You think th at helped? 

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah . Well look,
 Germans were funny people, you know. 

But Germans respect c lass, Ger ma n s 
respect some things, you know, and 
everything. And 
Ro nniker
(ph) could be German 
[indecipherable]
 it™s al most 
German name, 
Ronniker
(ph). So Œ 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
156
Q: So Œ and then, if Œ if it was a 
Hoover 
connection, tell me what was that 
connection between him and 
Herbert Hoover
. 
A: If I knew, I could tell you. Bu t he knew him from first World War, because I 
think after the first World War,
 Ho ov er
 sent money to  newly resurrected 
Poland
, 
and somehow he mu st have been  involved  
in that money. Because I remember that 
my father became a mayor of
 a small town where my si
ster was born. Actually Œ 
wait, what™s its name, you see Œ and over th
ere, my father received money to give 
to people who have trouble. So  my  fa
ther knew some Polish people. He didn™t 
know the Jewish community well, and he we
nt to a rabbi. And my father said to a 
rabbi, give me the name of the Jewish peopl
e that need financially help, because we 
got some money from the government, and 
we can help . And Œ and the rabbi gave 
him the names, and my father said, well, 
I know this fellow, he
 needs help, this 
guy. And the rabbi said no, they  are healthy,
 they can work. Only 
give to them that 
are sick. Don™t give to the people that 
are we Œ healthy, because they will stop 
working. My father was always telling me
. So, you know, there was some help for 
people Œ 

Q: Arranged thro
ugh this Mr. Œ 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
157
A: Œ arranged by the govern ment a
nd it could have been  some help from 
America
. 
You see, 
America 
wanted to give 
Poland 
this 
Marshall
 Plan, but 
Stalin
 refused to 
have 
Ma rsh a ll
 Plan. 
Q: Mm-hm, that™s afterwards. Now, when 
you™re talking about th
e help that your 
father got from the government and from 
Ronniker
(ph), you™re talk
ing first World 
War. 
A: The first World War. 
Q: After the first World War. 
A: After the first World War, 
there was help, and then was 
Marshall
 Plan, and 
Marshall
 Plan was run by a Polish member of
 Federal Reserve of amer Œ in 
America
. And he used to 
come and help us 
[indeciphera ble]
 he used to teach us, 
you know.  

Q: Okay . 

A: And nobody Œ Americans c
ouldn™t believe that I, going to  
NYU
, I™m talking to 
Federal Reserve fellow. And he told me that 
Marshall
 Plan was made to rebuild 
quick ly 
Eng l and
,
 Japan
, 
France
, 
Germany
, so we can trade wi Œ again. Give the 
money to  rebuild those countr
ies to trade, and that™s what he Œ h-he told us. 
Q: Okay , so aft Œ during th e second World War, Mr. 
Ronniker
(ph) is still in a 
position Œ so me kind of position of authority. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
158
A: Some kind of position of auth ority, in 
Poland
. 
Q: In 
Poland
. 
A: He™s not in the Polish govern ment Œ 
Q: No. 
A: Œ you see, but he is 
RGO
, or this was something calle
d like help to the people Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ because he got money from 
Ho ov er
. 
Q: And now was this 
RGO
 a Polish undergro und organization? 
A: No, wa Œ 

Q: Was this a German municipal organization? 
A: There was no German, there was nothing,
 it was Polish thing that he operated. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And he traveled. He said the worst 
thing was like he said, underground in  
Poland
. That was crazy. They would shoot 
the German somewhere, and then the 
whole village gets killed. He was telling 
me, you know, a lot of
 stupid things are 
being done. Why the hell shoot a German
 somewhere, where for pleasure or 
something, and then the Ge
rmans come and they Œ and 
kill a lot of people. Now Œ 
now they  say that 
Warsaw
 uprising, nobody wants to
 take responsibility who 
started it. B ecause 
London
 says, we didn™t give the 
orders, nobody wants to, you

159
know, what 
[indecipherable]
 wh ole population of 
Wa rsa w
 was evacuated and 
killed and everything. And the Œ now they
 say that a lot of it was done from 
Russia
, that 
Russia 
was broadcasting to Poles all 
the time to rise up against 
Germany
. Well, 
America
 did that with 
Hungary
. They were tellin g to Free
 
Euro pe
, to Hungarians to make a revolutio
n. And wh en th ey made a revolution 
over there, you remember the Hungaria
n revolution? What was this thing Œ 
Foster 
Dallas
 said, that™s an internal Russian affa
ir. So the Russians went in there and 
finished that revolution. 
Q: Going back to Mr. 
Ronniker
(ph). You mentioned during one time when we 

were not filming, that after the war some
body said at a party when  they found out 
that you should Œ th at whoever wa
s there should get on th eir knees. 
A: Got th e Œ got on their knees and started kissing his hands, because Œ 

Q: Who? Who said that? Who se Œ 

A: She Œ her mother. 
Q: Who™s her Œ who is the person? Wha Œ 
A: I don™t know, there was a Polish wo man Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ who was from 
Poland
, and she found out that this is 
Ronniker
(ph), and she 
says to her daughter, on your knees and start killing. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
160
Q: Kissing, kissing. 
A: Because the Germans had us 
all lined up to be killed, 
and he came and he talked 
to the Germans, and they let us go. You s
ee, so he had influence with the Germans 
in some way. Ho w, I don™t know. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Maybe because they knew 
of his connection, and they
 must have known who he 
was. 
Hitler
 wouldn™t send his interpreter, 
Schmidt
 to his trial in 
Kraków
, you 
know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And Œ and Œ and Œ a
nd that™s what he to ld us, and 
I Œ maybe he was lying, but I 
doubt it. 

Q: Okay . 

A: I was Œ he was an old man, and he se Œ 

Q: Well, it sounds like there™s quite a story. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 finally run away, because 
you know Ru ssian right away  
sentenced him to death, too. And he ran away  from 
Poland
 and he eventually came 
to 
America
. 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
161
Q: Well, it sounds like quite a story, and that
 there probably isn™t a lot Œ a lot to his 
story, but you ha Œ you only learned the fra
gments of it, and so  can only tell us 
fragments of it. 
A: Yeah, I can only tell what he told me. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: This is what he told me, this is his 
story. You see, there were so many things 
going on over there that no
body knew, that what was 
going on, who was what, you 
know? I Œ it™s awful, but ee Œ the people
 don™t learn to stop killing each other. 

Those African tribes and in
 British. Did you ever see 
Kuwait
 on the map?  
Q: Yeah. 
A: When  
Churchill 
was
 
drunk, as usual, they was Œ they  were dividing after the 
first World War. So 
Churchill
 drew a line like this, y
ou know, one line like this, 
one Œ they  cross, and they
 are like this. So you know 
what this is? Here is 
Kuwait
, 
you know what this is? 
No man™s land. Between 
Iraq
 and 
Sa udi Ara b ia
, this big 
piece of the lines that cross like this, it™
s Œ on the atlas if y ou look, it™s no man™s 
land, you know? And th is used to 
be a part of, once upon a time, of 
Iraq
. And Œ 
and amer Œ English designed the state, and 
they made a lot of everything. And all 
those countries that are now fighting in
 Africa
, they co nquered the Œ different 
tribes were living, and they put differen
t tribes together, and they all hate each

other, and they are all fighting. Th-Th-Th-The
 wo rld is crazy. They did a lot of bad. 
And wh en you are Œ wh en I think of
 the Spanish war, they did it in 
So uth 
America
, killing, slavering, everything. A-Americans came, British 
[indecipherable]
 Indians, who are savages, let™
s kill all the Indians, you know. 
Q: It™s a kind of sad note, 
and Œ to end our interview on
, but I™d like to ask you Œ I 
mean, I think we could sit and we could ta
lk about many things, two or three times 
over, but I Œ I want to kind of sum up ou
r conversation today, and our in terview 
today and d Œ how Œ how w
ould you think some Œ when
 someone will listen to 
your story th at has so many facets to it, 
that has both beautiful memo ries of where 
you grew up and how you gr
ew up, and then great, I™d 
say terror and fear, and i Œ 
and poverty, after the deporta
tion. And yet, you see, you 
have so much variety in it; 
what would you want people to understa
nd, from what you went through? What 
would you want them to 
understand from your life?  
A: Well, I™ll tell you something, always 
expect that something better will come. 
When  you get old, you lose it already, 
you know, but wh en you young, you look 
and you strive, you k
now. Like I went to 
NYU
 six years at night. Bu t I was Œ I 
knew I was getting somewhere. There were 
people telling me, you stupid going to 
school. I said, oh yes, I™m stupid. I had a gi
rlfriend, very  nice, and sh e told me, you 
stupid going to 
NYU
. I said, well,  but I™m going to 
study, and I™m going to finish 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
163
this school. And you know, there were a lot 
of things in life, and you always look 
for something. And I had one big objective, 
that I had my father who told me, take 
care of your mother and your sister. And I 
took care of them. My sister died in 
2001, you know, and to  the last day I alwa
ys took care of her, and I did everything 
that I could to help my si
ster, my mother. An
d you know, my cousin, responsibility 
for that. And also, in my  life, it was funny, but I took care of other people. I was Œ 
we were drafted into American army, a
nd there was a U k rainian fellow sleeping 
about me, and he started comp
laining that he has stomachache. So  I said, give me 

your knee. I pulled his knee, oh, appendicitis
. So I ran to the co
mpany headquarters 
and I said, get me an ambulance quickly, we 
have to take this fello w for operation. 
They  told  me, who do you know, what 
do you know, you think you stupid or 
something, he™s goldbricking.
 So I went back, I waited 15 - 20 minutes, I came 
back. You know, we™re going to su e you if
 he dies. He may die soon. They  called 
ambulance, straight from the barrack on the operating table,
 it was appendicitis. 
There was a fellow in 
Korea
, an d he used to stand and bu
rn his legs, and I realized 
that he was so depressed, that he didn™t pain, because we had those 
Coleman
 
stoves. So, how to help him?
 He had very th ick glasses. So I said, put your thick 

glasses right next to your bag, and in th
e mo rning step on them and crush them. 
And he crushed them. Doctors didn™t pa
y attention, nobody. They  send him to 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
164
Japa n
, and of course he was sent back hom
e. He was a mental case, you know. 
Look at my wife. She conks ou
t on me on the lawn, and I give 
CPR
 and I don™t 
know what the hell I do, but she™s alive. 
Q: And you™re talking about 
Francesca
 your wife? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yes, okay. And Œ 

A: But Œ but you know, you have things in 
life, and I like to give people help. Not 
everybody likes help. She object
s to me when I talk to my
 cousin, but I try to help 
them. They argue with me, you know. Bu t 
I have mo re knowledge about certain 
things than they have, and I 
try to give it to them. What 
they re Œ they refuse it, 
they fight it, but eventually 
they™ll take it. Eventually th
ey™ll take it. You try to tell 
people, this is what™s important in life, th
is is what you do. A
nd you know, a lot of 
people gave up, a lot of people give up. We saw this Œ I tell you, I saw one thing; 

Jewish people give up very fast. They 
break down . We saw them breaking down 
more than we were breaki
ng down, you know. I really 
saw that in my Jewish 
people. I don™t know why. 

Q: Where Œ 
A: I™m talking about 
Russia
. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
165
A: They were weaker, I 
think. They  were Œ somehow th ey didn™t have the 
consistency or something, and we Œ be
cause we saw them covered with lice, 
standing in line. Often we were trying 
to get the lice off; 
they didn™t. And I 
understand that once a docto r walk ed thro
ugh a hospital and Œ 
with a group of 
student doctors, and he asked them, which of
 these patients is 
the most sick, you 
know, the sickest person. So 
one fellow said, well he Œ th
is one has this disease, 
this one has this disease, this one has this
 disease. And the doctor said, you are all 
wrong. Look at him. There™s a fly walkin
g on his face, and he reacts already. He 
gave up. He™s the sickest. And you know, pe
ople, if they Œ if they react, you know 
Œ and I was lucky th at I had a mo ther that
 could help me so mu ch, you know, she 
helped me so, so much. 
Q: In what way? 

A: In every way. With the English language
, and with the getting me to the schools, 

you know. I wouldn™t be able, by my self 
to get. But for her, knowing th e English, 
knowing the French, they recognize right aw
ay that she was of a different class. 
The English respect the clas
s very much, so you know, 
they were conscious, and 
they saw it right away. And then I took adva
nt Œ and I made a lot of friends. In life, 
I made a lot of friends. I tell you like in 
Karachi
, we were Œ there was a club for 
British soldiers and diving and everything
. I got to know the Canadian fellow who 

 
Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski  
 
June 20, 2014 
 

 
 
166
was running. We used to st
eal Indian boats and go sailin g, the two of us together. 
And then  we™d steal cookies and everything
. And one time, maybe I told you th at, I 
told in Polish school 
that I take some boys, and they  
went with me over there. So in 
Polish school they didn
™t like me because I was go-going 
to this, to Œ in the school. 
Q: Cause you were mi ss Œ yeah. 
A: So they loaded a 
bus or truck of children and th ey 
went over there, and they told 
that we let them into that club. Of cour
se, they threw them out
. But the guys with 
me came, and th ey co uld swim and eat and 
everything, because I knew this fellow. 
You know, so I made contact.
 I told you in American 
Red Cross I made contacts 
with those soldiers, and I have everythi
ng. So  I always had some money, you 
know, for these things. Then I ran phot
ography, and I started making money on 
photography. You co nstantly had to fi
gure out something. 
When I came to 
America
 I had no money, so I took a course
 in radio an d television, I started 
learning how to do. And you know, and then
 I didn™t finish it because I went to 
Korea
. But I le Œ I learned so much about elec
tricity that Œ you have to ask people, 
and you have to talk to
 people so mu ch, because you learn something from 
everybody. Everybody teaches
 you something. Sicknesses. If you sick, learn from 

them what are the symptoms, what you ha
ve and ev erything, so
 you know, and you 
can tell somebody too, and you can help, 
you know. You cannot rely always on a

doctor only, because s-sometim
es you know you have to 
know a lot of things, and 
the mo re you can learn in life, the better fo
r you in life. And I think that™s what 
interests me. The Œ only 
now, I have the seat  
[indecipherable]
 and I cannot do 
anything, and I say, and I Œ 

Q: Well, you di Œ you™ve 
done something amazing. You 
have Œ you have told us 
about your story, and it is a 
multi-fascinated Œ faceted, fascinating story, and it™s a 
true gift to give to us
. So I thank you for it. 
A: Okay. W-Wait, I™ll go an
d bring you some pizza. 
Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
