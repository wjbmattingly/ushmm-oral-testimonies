W ebegin with this school portrait of AlbertGarih taken in1945.
 
 
Albert's parents, Benjam in and ClaireGarih,were born in Constantinople,T urkey, 
butm oved to Paris in the 1920s. Albert andhis twin brother, who died in infancy, were born 

June
 
24, 1938, in Paris, joining older siblings Jacqueline andGilberte.W e see all three 
siblings, including Albert with long hair, in this1943 photograph. Albert's father worked in a 

garm entfactory, and the fam ily lived in the janitor's apartment there.
 
 
In May
 
1940, Germ any invaded France andoccupied Paris.The Garihf am ily f led 
south, but they soon returned toParis where they were subjected toFrance's new anti
-Je wi sh

legislation. In1943, Albert'sf ather was deported to af orced labor cam p, and Albert's mother 
andthe children went into hiding with Madame Galop andher husbandfor the next six m onths. 

W hen they returned hom e in 1944, police wer e sent to arrest theGarihs butagreed to say 

instead that thefam ily was not hom e if  thefam ily would leave imm ediately.
 
 
Albert was placed ina Catholic boarding schoolf or boys, andhis sisters in onefor 
girls, in a suburbof Paris.W hen Paris was liberated in August
 
1944, Albert'sm other was able 
to bring her childrenback to the city. Claire and her childrenare shown together in this 

photograph. Albert's father, 
releasedf rom  the labor cam p, walkedf rom Belgium  to Paris, 
returning tohisf am ily in Septem ber
 
1944, onRosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year.
 
 
T he Garihf am ily rem ained in France after the war. Albert received his degree in 
E n glis h  
and Spanishto French tr
anslation f rom  the School of  Advanced Translation and 
Interpreters inSorbonne in 1962. He speaksf luently three languages, French, English and 

Spanish, andhis work tookhim  to different countries around the world.
 
S om e  of  t he  
organizations f o
r which he worked included the International Organization, the Am erican 

Developm ent Bank,the W orld Bank,andtheUnited Nations. His work with theW orld Bank 

brought him  toW ashington, D.C. in1976.

W ith  th a t,  I

[Applause]
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Thank you. It's a nice introduction.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Thank you. And thank you for joining us.Andf or sharing your experience. 
Fo r m e , it's  a
n honor to have this conversation with you.
 
 
Let's start in1940. France has been invadedby the Germ ans, by Nazi Germany. 
How did your f am ily react to this situation? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
W ell,when France was invaded, I think the invasion was launched May
 1
0 , 
1940, launchedam assive invasion that went f rom  Norwa y, Denm ark and the Netherlands, 

Belgium ,Luxem bourg and France. And when France was invaded in June
 
1940, there was the 
battle of  France, where the FrenchArm y was def eated.T he Frenchgovernment res
igned. And 
a new governm ent was formed which was under the hero of the FirstW orldW ar. He was 85 at 

thatpoint. He wentalong with the Germ ans.He signed the capitulation in the same rail car 

where the am nesty had been signed after the FirstW orldW ar, in
 
a sm all town north of Paris.
 
 
W hen France was invaded, like in Paris, and the Germ an Arm y m archeddown the 
Champs Elysees, which is the mainavenue
Œ 

 
[Phone ringing]
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Sorry about that. I'm sorry about that. Idon't know how to how to handle it.I 
apologize for that.
 
 
So when France was invaded, the population f rom northern France,notonly Paris 
butnorthern France, went south. It was a massive exodus.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Live program .
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Sorry about that. [Speaki
ng Non

English Language] 
 
 
Ok. I th in k I go t it. O
k.All right. Sorry. I apologi ze about that.I've never been very 

 
3
 
good with this, high
-
tech.
 
 
So the people of Paris andthe peoplef rom northern France went south in what 
cam e tobe known as le exod, theexodus. Millions of people on theroad,by car, bicycle, sm all 
cars, onfoot, by train. And we all went southto runaway f rom the Germ an invader. And we 

were underf ireof  the Germ an Air Force.T hat's how m y grandm other, uncle, aunt, and two 

cousins were k
ille d
. W
henthey were strafed,a bombf ell on their car. Yes. My grandm other 
was a victim  of  straf ing and m y uncle and aunt were in the car whenthebombfell on the 

bridge in the town about 60
 
m iles southof  Paris. That was thef irst tragedy during that w
a r,  
actually.
 
 
Andm y m other toldme atone point that we even slept in a chateau. Of  course it 
was notf irst class or anything like that.W e were sleeping onthef loor. And my mother had 

nothing tofeedme. I was just2 years old.And I was crying. And I was disturbing, you know, 

bothering everyone. So atone point
 
--
 
all I'm telling you now about this exodus is what I got 
f rom m y m other.There was a soldier am ong the people who ranaway like that
. T
here was a 
soldier who had a sm all bottle of Schnapps and
 
he gave m y m other a sm all shotof  Schnapps 
and said
,  ﬁG
ive him that
. I
t will c a lm  h im d o wn .
ﬂ 
Th a
t was m y f irst experience with Schnapps, 2 
years old. Anywa y, that did its job.Actually I calm ed down.
 
 
So we stayed afew days like that. At one point we went furtherdown in a small 
house also, and eventually having nowhere else to go,becausem y parents had nom oney, 

and we didn't have any relatives in the state or in Canadaor anywhere that we would have 

been able to turn to sothere was no action
, w
e had to go back home. So we did. And that's 
when we started to besubjected to the statute of the Jews, which was a set of rules that were
 

patterned af ter the Nuremberg Laws in Germany which were deprivi ng Jews of most of their 

b a sic righ t s.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
So
 
in France 
--
 
you went back toParis, and in Francethere were 
anti
-
Jewish m easures, anti
-
Je wish  la ws.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Could you tell usm ore what thatm eant then andwhere it aff ected?
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
W ell, these rules f or us
 
--
 b
asically these rules were the statuteof  the Jews , 
we're depriving the Jews of mostof  their basic rights. For us, you know, they said lawyers were
 

notallowed to practicelaw, doctors were notallowed to practicem edicine,andthings like that. 

For us it didn'tm ake adifference but we were notallowed to go intopublic transportation.W e 

were not allowed to go into theaters orm ovies or anything like that.It was ver y dangerous 

because they would go thereand they would check identity and take away all the Jews. So 

that was basically what it was.
 
 
My m other toldm e
 
--
 
another story she told me that Ihad no recollection, that on
e 
day she hadto go to run an
 
errand in Paris and we hadto takethe Metro. I was just a little 
child, soI have no recollectionof  that. But when we cam e out of the train,and we were at the 

endof  the line and there was an identity check
 
--
 a
n identity checkm eant, you know, since
 
--
 
at the beginning of  the war they had perform ed a census and the Jews had the stam pof  

Je wish  o r J o
n the identity card.W hen they were checking identities, if m y m otherhad shown 
her identity card, chances are I wouldn't be here today. She pretended to look into herpurse 

for her card. She walked between two policeandthey didn't stop her. If  they had stopped her 

that wouldhave beenthe endof m y story. So we survi ved that way. But it was by the skin of  

the tooth actually. Andwe had a couple of close calls like thatthat Iwi ll tell you f urther down in 

m y sto ry. S o  th at's how it wa s.
 

 
4
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
So I have inm y noteshere, some ofm y research, that yourf am ily were 
forced tom ove to a small apartm ent
,  
to  a two
-
room  apartm ent.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Yes.W hat happened ism y father was working in a garm entfactory. And the 
owner of thisfactory was a Jew. And thatmeant that when the statute of the Jews was passed 
in France, the com panies that belonged to Jews were conf iscated.They put an Aryan 

m anager. And theowner of  thefactory had to go intohiding also. He ran away. And we wer e 

liv in g in  t h e  ja n ito
r's apartm ent.That was an agreem ent between theowner of the com pany 
andm y father, who was the accountantof  the company, was doing the pay of  the em ployees. 
 
So when theowner
 
--
 
when thefactory was conf iscated, we were li ving in the janitor's 
apartm en
t and we were expelledf rom that apartm ent.W ehad tof ind an apartment. It was 

J u ly
 
1942. 
 
 
From  thenI rem em berever ything. All I am  going to tell youf rom  July
 
1942 is m y 
recollection. It'sno longer what m y mother told me. I remember thatwe had to move into this 

sm all apartm ent with very basic comforts.W e had only cold water.W ehad no bathroom .W e 

had just a sink.T hat was it. Andtwo room s.Not two bedroom s, two room s.Two room s, a tiny 

kitchenand atoilet.That was it.T hat's the best we couldf ind. Andthen we couldn't find 

anything else anyway. So we started living in thatapartment.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Sowhat did your parentsdecidef or you and your sister?W hathappened 
then af ter you were livi ng in that apartm ent? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
W ell,  a lre a d
y there were a lot of  restrictions onfood.W ecouldn'tf ind
 
--
 
ever ything was on theticket.W ehad the ration ticketfor bread.
 
I  r em em be r  o ne  e gg was a 
luxur y item .W edidn't see eggs. Now we buy them  by the dozens. In thosedays if  you could 

f ind one e
gg, it was a luxur y item. So we hadnothing
 
--
 
you know, very basic. Thefood was 
terrible.
 
 
At one pointm y parents decided to sendus 
to  
a farm
o
utside of Paris. T hey sent us. 
T hey said we would be betterf ed on thefarm . They didn't say to theladies
 
--
 
it was two ladies 
who were running thefarm . I guess thefarmer him self m ust have been taken prisoner with the 

French Arm y. I don't know. I never saw a m an there. I saw only these two women, two sisters. 

Andm y parents didn'tsay that we were Jewi sh. But I was 4 years old
. W
hatdid I know about 
that
?  
And one day
 
--
 
I was ver y social
.  
I was talking to the ladies
 a
nd one day in the 
conversation I said, yeah, we're Jewish. That's all it tookf or the ladies to sendus back to our 

parents.T hey didn't want to takeany chances with Jews, hiding Jews, because it was ver y 

dangerousf or people to hide Jews. They m ightf ace execution,deportation, Idon't know what. 

But it was very dangerous. So they didn't want to take any chances with us and they sentus 

right back
 
to our parents. 
 
 
W espent about six m onthson thatf arm .
 
It was the winter of 1942, 1943. I 
re m
em ber there was a lot of snow. It was a cold winter. I rem em berm y sisters com ing back 
f rom  school. They would go to school. I was staying with the ladies. I was 4 years old. So I 

rem em ber the song [Speaking Non
-
English Language]. That brings m e back to that period. 
Anyway.
 I  
told the ladies, and they sent us right back.W e went back to our apartment.T hat 
was in the spring of 1943.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
So you went
 
back. You went back to Paris with your parents.W hat was your 
parents' reaction afteryou all came back andwh y?
 

>> Albert Garih:
 
My father told me,he said, "Don't ever, ever say that you're Jewish."  Because 
it couldhave costus our lives, actually
, w
he
n these ladies then sent us back. Som y f athertold 
m e, don't ever, ever say and that stayed with m efor many years, even after the war. It was
 
--
 

 
5
 
was it that I was af raid, I was asham ed? I don't know. It was probably a combination of both. 
B u t I ke pt itf
or m yself.
 
 
I remember after the war, I hadanappendectom y. I went to the hospital. And the 
nurse was a nun. Youknow, she was takinggood careof m e. I was 11.She said,
 
ﬁH
ave you 
m ade yourf irst comm union?
ﬂ 
AndI said yes.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Albert Garih
:  
I didn't know what to say. "Did you go to
 
--
" I said sure. Ihad to lie. I was 
asham ed. I was asham ed. You know, you have this sense of guilt.T he way Je ws were treated, 

you felt guilt. You wonderedof  what.But anywa y, it was a ver y stra ngefeeling and 
a  ve r y 
unpleasantf eeling. It tookm euntil I reachedabout theage of 15or16 to open up, and then I 

started to really
 
--
 
I lost all m y complexes about thatand I startedtobe very vocal. Butbefore 
that, you know, I would see
 
--
 
there was a girl in the
 
school playground and people woulduse, 
you know, anti
-
Sem itic slurs, I was afraid. I was af raid of  saying that I was Jewish. It was li ke a 
stigm a f or m e. It took a while f or m e to overcom e that stigma, actually. 
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Before we go to when you were 11, let's goback.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
N o,  no ,  no .
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
1943, 1944, specif ically Septem ber
 
1943, yourfather, Benjam in, was 
deportedtoaf orced labor cam p in the Channel Islands, theonly British territory occupied by 

the Axis 
powers. W ha
t did your m other do?
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
My mother was desperate. She was terrif iedthat at any m omentthey could 
com e, there would bea bang onthedoor and peopletaking usaway. She knew it was ver y 

dangerousf or us to stay in the apartm ent butshe didn't
 
have anywh ere elseto go.
 
 
Oneday in the streetmarket she met this lady. Somehow shefeltshe could open up 
to her, Madame Galop. Shetoldhera story. She said she was terrif ied that at any m om ent 

they could come andtake us away. And the lady went back to herhusband.She told our story. 

And thenext day herhusband, 
M
onsieur Galop, came with a cart, and we took whatever 
personal effects we could take, which was ve ry l ittle, actual
ly, with  us.W e we n t to
 
live with the 
G a lo p  f am ily.  
 
 
T hey were a protes
ta n t f a m i l y
, a
 
couple with two young daughters. Iwas 5 at that 
tim e.It was in thefall of 1943.And they had two daughters who wer e 4and 3. Curious 

enough, to me, it was like a vacation during that period. First of all, Ididn't go to schoolbutfor 

o th
er reasons, because m y mother was af raid to send me to school.
 
But also, 
M
onsieur Galop 
was a sculpture. He was making setsfor movie studios.T hey hada big warehousebehind the 

house where they wer e storing all of these sets.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
P r op s .
 
>> 
Albert Garih:
 
Yeah.W ehad great hide and seek gam es in the warehouse. Ihad two 
com panions, you know, playing com panions.Sof orm e it was great. For m y m other, she was 

under constantf ear that som ebody m ight see usor reportus.Somy m other was always, 
you 
know, terrif ied. And she is the one who suffered them ostf rom  the war.
 
 
My sisters also were tr aumatized.T hey were older thanm e,
 
f i ve
 
a nd 
eight
 
years 
older thanm e. So they realized thedangers. I didn't realize thedangers. For instance, if  there 

w
as a raid, an air raid,with an alert, you know, the sirens blasting in the middle of the night,m y 
m other hadto takem e out of m y bedand I was bothered thatI was taken out of my bed. But 

what does it mean tohave a bom b that canfall on our heads? I hadno idea.I didn't realize the 

danger. So I was more bothered thananything else. But m y sistersandm y mother were 

t e rri f i ed.
 
So yeah, it was ver y bad from  thatpoint of  view, actually.
 

 
6
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
I have in m y noteshere, Idid som e research, other than what you just 
m entioned, while youwere staying with theGalops, you learned to readand write. T hat was 
what you usedto do.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
W ell,you know, I had nothing else todo so m y mother taughtm ehow to read 
and write. I was 5,5
 
1/2. So I learned to readand write. And I rem em berthat was when Iwas 
with the Galopfam ily that I read m yf irstf ull page of a book.It tookm eaboutanhour.I had no 

idea what I was reading but I coulddecipherever ything. Andeventually that helpedme but in
 
a 
different way. I will tell thenext page.
 
 
So we spend about six m onths with the Galops.W e would have stayed with them 
until the endof  the war had it not beenf or som eof  theneighbors who were starting totalk. 

T here were some rumors. There was apainter whose wif e was a sym pathizer of  the Reich and 

oneday came to Madam e Galop and said, "W hen are you going to get rid of that scum ?" W e 

were the scum .
 
At thatpoint, Madam e Galopandm y m otherfelt itmight be saferf orus to go 
back home, which we did.
 
 
T hat was in the spring of 1944. It was bef oreD
-
Day.W e spent afew weeks at hom e 
like that. Until oneday, 8:00
 
in them orning, Iwas still in bed
 
--
 m
y mother would leave m e in 
bedbecause shedidn't want to takem e to school.Som etim estheywould go to school and 

take the childrenaway and their parents would never hear of them again. Somy sisters, itwas 

a different story. T hey were bigger. So it was m andatory f or them  togo to school. Butfor me it 

was not.
 
 
So I was staying with m y m other. Andone
 
morning around 8:00
 
in them orning, two 
police inspectors, Madam e Garih, we cam e to take you away. So my m other's legs started to 

shake. They said,forwhatever reason
 
--
 
I scratchm y head totry to find them otivation of these 
two inspectors.W as itthat
 
theyf elttheir side of  the war was lost, they had lost the war? Maybe 
it was just hum anitarian reaction.Som epolice inspectors were showing some hum anity like 

thatbut not many, unfortunately.
 
So once again, it was sheer luck.T hese two police inspector
s 
told m y m other, W
e'regoing to report we didn'tfind youbut youmust not sleep in your 
apartm ent tonight because when we reportthat we didn'tf ind you, they're going to sendm aybe 

the Gestapoor other police and they're going to put some seals on the door.And if  they f ind 

you, they're going to take you away.
 
 
Som y m other woke me up. I was already awakened but she gotme upand dressed 
m e. She was gi ven the nam eof  a social worker. She went to see.The lady said
, Y
ou have to 
allow m e afew days; I cannotf ind a solution like thatfor every one of you overnight.
 
So  
m eanwhile, try to see If you cannot sleep in your neighbors but not in your apartm ent. 
 
 
And that's what we did. Our next doorneighbor was a Comm unist couple. He had 
been servicedf or Labor Service in Germ any and not reported f or duty so he was also wanted 

by the Gestapo.W e slept in their apartm ent.It was ver y convenientbecause both of them  

were working at night. T hey were on night shif t. So we would sleep in their bed atnight. And in 

the 
m orning when they would come back, we would gi ve them the bed.W e stayed like that for 
a f ew days.
 
 
Meanwhile, m y sisters were staying with the lodge keeperdownstairs. Mother
 
--
 
onceagain Idon't remem ber having seen am an in thatfam ily. Probably hadbeen taken 

prisoner with the French Arm y. Idon't know.But this wom an was a m other of three children, 

two boys, 14 and 12 or something like that, and a young girl who wa s one year younger than 

m e. And m y sisters slept at the lodge keeper's and we slept at the Comm unist neighbor's until 

eventually the social worker came back to m y m otherand said" Ifound a placef oreach one of  

 
7
 
you."
 
 
My m other was placed as a governess with afam ily of  eightor 10 children near the 
EiffelT ower. And we were placed in a Catholic boarding schoolsoutside of Paris, in a suburb 
called Montf erm eil which was m adefamousby a chapter of "Les Miserables." T hat's where 

Jean Valjean m et Cosette, actually.
 
W e were in Catholic boarding schools. My m other was in 
Paris. She was there.She
 
was on thef ront row witnessing the liberationof  Paris. Because 
there was f ight
in g
 
betweenthe Germ an soldiers and theallies. 
 
 
Actually in Paris was the French 
2
nd
 
Arm y division of General Leclerc de 
Huteclocque. General Leclerc joined others in London
.They senthim  to Af rica. And in Af rica 

with the 2nd Arm y divi sion he took an oaththat he would liberate Paris and Strasbourg, the city 

between Germ any
 
and France.It was taken away by France in 1870, had been given backto 
France after the First WorldW ar and was taken again when the Germ an Arm y occupied 

France.
 
So he tookanoath of  liberating ParisandStrasbourg, and he did. But there was also, 
of  course, Am erican soldiers, Canadian soldiers, Canadian soldiers,Allied Forces,even 

Australian f orces ac
t ual l y.
 
 
So we were sent to the boarding schools. I rem em ber the headm istress. It's too 
bad. I would have loved tohave her recognized as a righteous am ong thenations but I didn't 

know her nam e. I went backabout10,12 years ago to Montf erm eil. I found 
the place. I found 

the school. 
I
t's called Institution Valjean. Yes. There were African sem inaries going back to 
Af rica topreach the gospels to Af rican people. But I couldn'tf ind thename of the head 

m istress. I was 6 years old. I was the youngest in the
 
school. Children went from  the ageof 7 
to 14. I was the youngest. And she was always holding m y hand. Ihadpref erred treatment 

there.
 
 
I remember,for instance, the priest in that school. 
He
 
was suff eringf rom  some sort 
of  ulceror cancer of the stom ach, Idon't know e xactly. And som ehow they managed tof ind a 

couple of potatoes and a small piece of butter and they m ade him  som em ashed potatoes.And 

even that he could not swallo w. And I wasf ed the lef toversf rom  thepriest's mashed potatoes. 

T ha t wa s th
e bestm eal I had during thatperiod. Until this day I lovem ashedpotatoes.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Albert, tell ushow was lif e in the boarding school.W hat did you dof orfun? 
W ere you in com munication with your m otherand sisters? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
I was totally alone.I would see m y sisters every Sunday in church. Because, 
you know, it was two C atholicboarding schools
, o
nef or girls. I was in onefor boys.W e would 
m eet in churchevery S unday. T hat's all the contact Ihad with m y f amily. I hadno contactwi
th  
m y m other. My m other could not com municate with us. She was taking care of  eight or 10 

children inthatf am ily and she hadno way of comm unicating with her own children.
 
 
So that lastedf or the summer of 1944. August
 
25, 1944, Paris was liberated.W e 
m
ust have been
 
--
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Before we get there.W e're still in the summ er. One informationthat Ihave 
onm y research is that you hadanunusualfavorite toy while you we re in the boarding, Catholic 

boarding school. Right? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
A  p a s ti
m e inthat school
 
--
 
f irst of all, it was summ er. So it was summ er 
vacation. And the children som ehow stayed in the school. So did I.I had no choice. So we 

were putting
 
--
 
it was i n the sam e classroom , diff erent rows, diff erent labels. Of  course I was 
th e
 
youngest so they putm e with the babies.And I was m aking strokes like this. I knew how to 
read and write already. ButI was, you know, assigned this jobof  wri ting strokes like that. 

Sometimes when there was an air raid, we would go down to the shelters until the raid was 

 
8
 
over. And then we would come ou
t. And one of  our f avorite past
i m es
 
with other kids was to go 
into theplayground and pick up all thepieces of  shrapnel that we could f ind. Ihad abig 
collectionof  shrapnel at the end of the war, which I
 
brought back hom e but m y m other didn't 
wait to throw them  away, actually. Yeah.
 
 
It'sf unny because I wr ote a story
 
--
 
I go to aclass at them useum .I wrote a story 
about that. Harry, also a survi vor, was f rom Belgium , one
-
year
-
older than me, said it'sf
u nny 
because two years ago I wrote a sim ilar story about collecting shrapnel also. So Ididn't know 

that. So we had the sam e hobbies. 
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Thestories on our website
 
--
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. It was publishedactually. It's true. 
W e ha d  t h at .  Tha t ' s  
what we did.
 
 
So, anywa y, going back.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Now let's go back to1944August. Let's go to August
 
1944, end of  the 
summ er, liberation in Paris.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Pariswas liberated. After afew days, the train servi ce was res
tored. And, of  
course,m y m other couldn't wait to come to see us.She cam e. And she was so appalled bythe 

wa y we looked.Because, you know, at that school theheadm istress was wonderf uland really 

I'm  sorry I couldn't gether name to have her recognized as righteous among the nations. She 

was deserving that. I couldn'tf ind hernam e.
 
 
Anyway, but other than that, thefood was terrible. First of all, it was scarce. And we 
were f ed
 
--
 
I remem ber m ost notorious was rottenbeans.W e werefed rottenbeans.I w
a s 
constantly sick, of  course. I was weak. SoI lost a lot of  weight. 
 
 
And whenm y m other cam e to seeus
 
--
 o
ne m orning, m y 
sist e rs 
--
 
we were in the 
playground.. It was sum mer. It was hot.They said," Guess who is here?" You know what? At 

the age of  6 it
's amazi ng how f ast you can f orget about your loved ones. I had no idea who 
couldbe there. SoI was curious. I pushed m y sisters andm y m other was very short, was ri ght 

behind.W hen I saw, of course I jum ped into her arm s.But it tookm e
 
--
 
when they said
 
gu es s  
who is here, Ihad no idea it was m y m other.I hadf orgottenalm ostabout my m other.T o this 

day If eel guilty about that.But that's how it was.
 
 
Som y m other took usright awa y hom e. She tookm e thef irst day
 
--
 
she had the 
ration stamps. Shebought a loaf of bread. W e swallowed the loaf of bread in no tim e, with m y 

sisters. She tookm e the sam eday. And the next day she went backto pick up my sisters.W hy 

she was not able tobring the threeof us the sam e day I don't know.But she went back the 

s
econd day to bring my sisters hom e. 
 
 
She leftm eunder thecustody of a next doorneighbor who had thekey. Every once 
in a while she would check onm e.I was always starvin g. T here was nothing toeat in the 

house.W ehad no ref rigerator, nothing like that. In thosedays, youknow. There was a green 

apple. And it was theworst I could have with  m y stomachthe way it  was. I atethe green apple. 

As soon asIf inishedthe greenapple, I was still touchingm y teeth like that when Iheard the 

key in th
e door. S
he cam eand she said, ﬁW hat did you eat?
ﬂ 
I said," Nothing."  And shefound 
out that I ate theappleand she was very upset aboutthat but it was too late. I ate the apple 

a n ywa y.  
 
 
So therefore the next day m y m other broughtm y sisters back.
 
Meanwhile, m y 
f ather 
was in the Channel Islandsbetween FranceandGreatBritain.In May
 
1940, about one m onth 
b ef o r e D
-
Day, the inmates
 
--
 
you know, the allies were bom barding the Straits of Dover to 
m ake the Germ ans believe that there was aninvasion, it would takeplace in the Straitsof  

 
9
 
Dover which was the shortestdistancebetween France andBritain.So the inmates were on 
the Channel Islands,further toBrittany, actually. T hey were m oved to the Straits of  Dover to 

repair thef ortif ications that were being dem olishedby the U.S. Air Force and RAF, you know, 

theallies Air Force.
 
 
My f athertoldm e atone point when there were raids like that, they would lay f laton 
the ground.Andatone point there was a raidlike that and they were  straf ed. And there were 

Germ an soldiers laying next to m y father. And when the raid was over, m y father stood up,and 

the German soldier stayed on the ground. Hehadbeen killed. So itwas, you know
 
--
 
I don't 
think they really targeted the guy in particular they were straf ing. My father
 
wa s lu cky t o  
survi ve. He stood up.And theGerman soldier was killed.
 
 
So at one point when the allies were pushingthe Germansback toGerm any
 
--
 
actually, atone point the Germ ans put theIron Guard inm atesona train boundfor Germany 

where they were going to sendthem  to a camp. Idon't know, maybe just to afactory of  slave 

labor.T he train was stopped inBelgium , in northernBelgium ,by aBelgium resistance, 

partisans, who had blown up the railroador bridge, I don't know. Sothere was abattle. And 
in  

the confusiontheGerm ans released the900 inm ates. 
 
 
Andm y father, after staying a coupleof  days with a
 
B e lgiu m  
f am ily to recover some 
strength, beingf ed almost nothing because at that time there was not much to eat,actually,  

but to regain somef orces, som e strength
, h
ewalked back home f rom  northern Belgium to 
Paris. It was a200
-
m ile walk. He arrived them orning of Rosh Hashanah, which is the Jewish 
new year. It was also in the morning. Andm y m other was alsodressing m e to go to the 

synagogue f or
 
thef irsttim e since bef ore thewar, you know.W edidn't go to the synagogue 
during the war. And there was a knock on the door. And we were living in an apartm ent,on a 

long corridor. It was very dark. T he time switch was lasting just afew seconds,m aybe
 
on e 
m inute. It was not enoughfor the secondf loor
,  
which here would be the thirdf loor because 
they had groundf loor, f irstf loor, secondf loor. By the tim ehe gotto the door, it was dark. It 

tookm y m other af ew seconds to recognize him . He looked like
 
a ghost,actually. He was 
skinny. He had lost weight. He hadan accident
 
--
 
did I tell the story? 
 
 
No .
W
ell, when he was in captivity, he had a bad accident. He was carryin g a truck 
full of  cementonthe scaffolding, along a cliff, to build bunkers, these f ortifications. He stepped 

on a loose 
board and the board
 
came to hithim  on theforeheadand hefell off the cliff , 
com pletely down. He lost a lot of blood. He was picked up by the soup truck. He was sewn, 

you know, thebest way they could.T ill his dea
th he had big scars. 
H
e was bald so you could 
see the scars onhis head actually. He was not in good shape but he had survived. 
 

 
Ourf am ily had survive d. My m other survived,  m y sisters, me andmy f ather. We all 
survi ved. But,as I said, we lost m y grandmother, uncle,aunt, cousins during the exodus.And 

we lost af ew m ore cousins who were takenawa y to Auschwitz who didn't come back. So 

that'sour story actually.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
So  
y
our f ather comes f rom  Rosh Hashanah. Did he go
 
--
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
N o.  W
e didn't go. Idon't remem ber that we went tosynagogue. It was too 
m uch. He was just com ing hom eaf ter a long walk.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Very long.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Plus, I m ust tell youm y parents were notparticularly reli gious
. W
ere not 
religious, actually. Butaf ter the war they didn't want to setfoot in the synagogue anym ore.
 
My m other was wil ling to take us and we went af ew tim es with m y mother. My f ather didn't 

want to setf oot ina synagogue anym ore.

>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
So October
 
1944, back to school
. 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Oh, yeah.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
You start school.Tell usmore about your experience.
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Oh, that was a great day
. 
October
 
1, 1944, was back
-
to
-
school day. I was so 
eager to start going to school.I was just 6 years old. I was ver y m otivated. I was very happy. I 
was a ver y good student, at least thef irstfew years. Af terwards it was okbutthef irstf ew 

years I was so m otivated. I was so happy tobe in school, to betreated likeother childrenand 

not to have toescape, to hide
 
oranything like that. So that was a greatexperience.And I 
enjoyed school very m uch.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Didyour classm ates know that you were Jewish? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Som e.W e were living
 
--
 
this apartm ent was part of a hugeapartm ent complex 
where there were a lot of kids.They all knew that I was Jewish. Our next doorneighbors,the 

Comm unists, knew 
we
 
were Jewish. T heir daughter was m y age. I had
 a 
f riend who was 
Greek. My parents wer e f rom  
T
urkey. SoGreeks andT urks usually don't get along ver y wel
l 
but somehow, you know, they had som uch in comm on, thefood and everything like that sowe 

becam ef riends with this wom an andI becamef riends with her sonwho was one year younger 

than me.
 
 
I was not living in a Jewish neighborhood.T here were some Jews
.  I r e m em be r  
a cro ss 
--
 
there were two parallel buildings like that. And right acrossf rom us there was a 
Jewish f am ily. T he man had been sent. He was 
t he  
f irst we saw com ing back like a living 
skeleton.T hat was our f irstexperience with people com ing back
 
f rom  the camps. T his m an 
was a living skeleton.And I remem ber this. Irem em ber thism an
 v
ery m uch.
 
But other than 
that, there were not many Jews in that neighborhood. 
 
 
But thepeople were very f riendly. T hey were notanti
-
Sem ites in that building, you 
k
now. People were f riendly. I had no problem. I was playing with theother kids downstairs.But 

m y m other was always  af raid because sometim es I would be playing downstairs like that and I 

was bothering som eone and they would say, 
ﬁ
Madame Garih, Albert is bothering m e.
ﬂ 
W hen  
she heard someone calling her name, she was always af raid. She said if  there's a police or 

anything, they m ighthear the name and they m ight com e and takeus away. So she was 

constantly af raid of this danger. I was not.I was a young boy willing to have a goodtime to 

play with m y playm ates.
 
 
I remember it was in that building that we witn essedthe end of the war. Theend of 
the war happened oneyear later, May
 
1945, May
 
8, 1945, andI rem em ber it was announced 
by the sirens.Again, they were announcing the raids.And we knew that today, thatday, 

Ma y
 
8, 1945, they wer e announcing the endof  the war. And we wer e playing. As I said, we 
were li ving in t wo long buildings like that.And we were at the endof the building. And I hada 

f riend who
 
was one
-
year
-
older thanm e, stronger thanm e,f aster in running andeverything but 
thatday when the siren blasted, I beat him at thef inish line. It'shard to express but something 

that was takenout of m y chest, know?W h
ew
. T hat was m y reaction tothe e
nd of the  wa r .
 
So we started running
. W
e raced, and Ibeathim  at thef inish line.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
W onderf ul. So we're going to jum pto the1990s,when through your 
application to Israel's officialm emorial to the victim s of the Holocaust, they recognized the 

Galop
s 
as righteous am ong thenations. Can you tell usm ore that?
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Actually, I had no idea aboutthis notionof  righteous among the nations. Iwas 
workin g at theW orld Bank at that tim e. And one day we went to a restaurant with af rie
nd who 

was li vin g in Israel. She was just a consultant with us. I told her m y story. And she said, 
ﬁH
a ve  

 
11
 
you ever thoughtabout having them recognized as righteousamong thenations?
ﬂ 
I had no 
idea what it was. Shegave m e anam e.I rem em ber it was a certa
in  n am e,  yo u  k no w,  f r om  gi r l  
scouts.If orgotthenam e of  the woman.So I wrote to the lady. I told herm y story. Of course 

sh e  
--
 
subm itted to a panel.They wanted conf irmation by m y sisters. So they sentthe story to 
m y sisters. And m y sisters corroborated whatI said.And they were r ecognized as righteous 

am ong the nations in 1992.
 
 
And I remem ber
 
--
 
Ihad lost track.T he Galops had retiredand living in the South of  
France. Andthe otherfam ily was li vin g f urther south also, actually.
 
Bef ore we had the 
com puterand all of that, we hada sm all whatthey call
 
--
 
it was a sort of  com puter where you 
couldf ind someone, the phone number of som eone. So Ifound Madame Galopand I called. It 

was 1989, 1990. 
ﬁ
Madam e Galop,are you the widow of
ﬂ 
--
 
I knew 
Monsieur
 
Galop
 
passed 
away. 
ﬁ
Are you the widow?
ﬂ 
She said yes. 
ﬁ
I am  A l be r t  G a r i h.
ﬂ 
Oh, she was so
 s
--
 
I sa id , Ia m  
in Paris. I live in the states.I cannot com enow because I have to go back to the states but I 

prom ise the next tim e I come to France I come to visit you. She was living in a city Southof  

France. Six months later I was back in France. If lew and we spent two days together. She 

loved m e like her son, actually. She was so happy. I told her what Iwas doing, that I hadthem 

recognized as righteous and all of that. She said, ﬁYou have to hurry.
ﬂ 
She was sufferingf rom  
cancer.And actually she died six m onths later. 
 

 
But in1992, in the spring of  1992, we hada ceremony in the Southof  France, inthe 
suburb, with them ayor, some officials there,where they were granted themedal of the 

righteous. Andthe sam e happened a couple of m onths later. I could not go back to Francef or 

the ceremony. It was in theT own Hall of  Paris. Them ayor atthat tim e Jacques 
Chira c ,  
who 
gave them  the m edal of  the righteous.
 
 
And three years ago
 
--
 
unf ortunately they both have passedaway now. And even 
the Galop daughters, who were younger than me, they both passed away. But three years ago 

I had the opportunity to be reunited with theirgrandchildren.They were very eager to h
ear the 

story abouthow we spent six m onths with their grandparents and what they did and how much 

danger they were exposed to.T hey were ver y eager tohear the story. So it was a wonderful 

experience
f
or them  and f or m e. 
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
R i gh t .  Bef o r e w
e go to the audiencefor questions, I understand that you 
have a connection with the m useum , specialexhibition, "Som e were neighbors."  Can you 

share with usm oreabout that connection? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
The connection i
s wh e n I saw th e  title s, I sa id
 
ther
e's no way I'm  not going to 
be a guide to thisexhibit
. B
ecause our apartm ent was sandwichedbetween two apartments. 
On one side were theComm unist couple who saved us by taking us, you know, to that 

apartm ent until the social worker couldf indahiding placefor us. And on the other side were a 

m iddle aged couple.The wom an seemed tobef riendly, actually. Iwas a kid. I guessI must 

have been
 
--
 
Idon't know. She liked m e. Andwe were sharing a balcony. Andthere was just 
iron railing separating the side 
of  t he
 
balcony f rom  ours. 
 
 
One day I 
rememberm y m other passed meover to this lady and she gave m e 
som ething I had never seen before. A yellow tom ato, for the f irst tim e I had 
a ye llo w 
tom ato. 
T oday it's a staplebut in thosedays I had notseenthat
.  So
 
I rem emb e r tha t. 
 
 
Her husband was sending people tothe deportation, to the death cam ps. Did they 
know we were Jewish?  According to m y sister therem ighthave been a possibility they knew 

and somehow they decided to protectus. I have no idea.I think these people were very 

dangerous. Actually, at theend of the war them an was found inamovie theater, gunneddown 

 
12
 
by som eone in retaliation. T hat's the kindof  neighbors that we had.
 
So when I saw " Som e 
W
e re  
N
eighbors," I said I have to do this exhibit. 
 
>
> Jaim e Monllor:
 
Yeah. "Som e W
er e 
Neighbors"  is our exhibition.Look at it here inthe lower 
level here of the museum . You don'tneed any tickets to view it. It takes approxim ately one 
hour.So we highly recommend you stopby.
 
I know thatAlbert isa great
 
tour guide. He won't 
be able to do it today but he's a great tour guide on thatexhibition.
 
 
W e have time f or a couple of  questions f rom  our audience. And please rem ain 
listening becauseaf ter the questions, Albertwi ll close theprogram with a few last words. W e 

have two m icrophones. So we'd like you to wait toask a question until you have a Microphone. 

I'll repeat the question so Albert hears it.T ry to make the question as brief  aspossible.
 
>>
 
W as your father, Benjamin, abletohidehis Jewishness the
 
whole time thathe was on the 
Channel Islands and in Belgium ?
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
No. He was taken there as a Jew.
 
>>
 
A s a  Je w?
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
Yeah.He was lucky that he was not sent to a camp in Polandbecause if  he 
hadbeen sent to a cam p in Poland, he wouldn't have com e back.Chances arehe wouldn't 

have come back because he was ver y outspoken. Atone point
 
hewas asking f ellow inm ates 
h
ow do you say bastard in Germ an
.  
He wanted to insult these people.T hey kept him  quiet. But 
in Poland, with the SS and with the Ukrainians and all of these people, w
ouldn™
t have lasted 
ver y long. 
 

>>
 
H i ,  Mr.
 
Garih.W hydid yourf ather never want to return to a synagogue? 
 
>> Albert Garih:
 
That's a diff icult question. First of all, m y parents were never particularly 
re ligio
us. My grandparents were. I understand m y mother
 
--
 
m y gra ndf ather, who passed away 
when m y m other was a child, actually, m y m otherused totell me that he used to go to 

synagogue. Andm y uncle was his son, was singing in the synagogue, a neighborhood in 

I
stanbul. Butm y father had to start working at theage of 10. Hehada rough lif e, actually. He 
m anaged to self
-
educate him self .That's how he becam eanaccountant. He was taking care of 
thepayroll of the people in the garmentf actory where he was workin g
. B u t afte r h is 
experience, you couldn't talkto him about going to synagogue anym ore. That was it.
 
 
I didn't get any Jewish education.T o this day I'm  struggling trying to read
 
--
 
I ' m  go i n g 
to synagogue every Saturday, actually, and struggl ing reading. So
 
Ihada bar m itzvah. I asked 
m y parents, I said I wanted abarm itzvah. T hey said ok.T hey gave m ea very basic training f or 

that. And that was it. Af ter that, wentbackhom eand that was the end of our experience with 

synagogues.
 
 
I remember when I was around 20 years old,som etimes I was drawn to goto 
synagogue. I remember one day, Yom  Kippur, I was at the addressfor the synagogue, I saw 

all of  these ladiesbeautifully dressed andall of t
h at. Ife lt intim ida ted . I sa id
 
I can n ot go  the re . I 
didn't get inside. I shied away actually.
 
>> Jaim e Monllor:
 
I'm going to turnback to Albert inam om ent to close ourprogram .Before, I 
would like to thank you all f or being here.W ehope you com eback.W ehave our
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
program  everyW ednesday andThursday u
ntil the m iddle of  August.
 
 
It is ourtradition here at
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
that ourFirst Personhas the last word. But 
bef ore we turn back to him ,for those who didn't have a chancetoask Albertany questions, he 

wi ll rem ain here on the stage. You can comeby and ask him questions, say hello, shake his 

hand, takea photograph with him .W e also have our staff photographer, Joel,here. He wil l 

takea graph with the audience. So rem ain around. 
 

 
13
 
 
T hank you.And Albert, thank you. Youhave the last word.
 
>> A l b e r t  G
arih:
 
Ok. Thank you.
 
 
You know, I think this m useum  is abeautif ul institution.T he reasonwh y I joined
 
--
 
I 
wanted to joinf rom  the day I retired. It tookme a long tim e todecide to take the jump and 
com e. Idid thatabout six years ago. I've been thinking about itfor a long tim e.
 
 
T he reason why I'm  happy to be here and to speakand to speak to you andto speak 
to all thepeople thatIm eet at the desk upstairs, and whenI'm  giving the guided tours of the 

Perm anent Exhibitionor the" Neighbors"  exhibit,
 
is I think there isaver y im portant message 
that is conveyed by this m useum
; t
hat'sthat it's ver y im portant to teach people about what 
happened so that it won't happenagain. Andthe reason why it happened was basically hatred. 

I am  a very strong advoca
te against hatred, ag
ainst bigotry, against
 
ra cism ,  an t i
-
S em it is m
, y
ou 
know, looking at people with contem pt because of a difference. I think peoplehave somuch 

today, looking at other people and seeing thedifference.That's very bad. That's why I think 

this museum  is im portant. That's why I thinkm y m ission in thism useum is important. I am  

tryin g to convey
 
--
 
I speak at the desk upstairs.W hen young kidsf rom  the schools,I always tell 
them  it's importantthat you don't hate
 
--
 
that you don't lookat people who are different with 
contem pt or with hate. You know, hate is theworst thing that happened in the world.
