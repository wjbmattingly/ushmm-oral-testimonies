Q: Ok, now we ™re starting. Would 
you tell me your full name please? 
 

A: My full name is Doris Gr eenberg, and I was born Fuchs.
1
 
 

Q: What, what year we
re you born and where? 
 

A: I was born in 19- 1930, in Wa rsaw, Poland. 

 

Q: Doris, would you tell me about your fa mily and your childhood before the Nazis -- your 
parents, your grandparents?  What 
was life like for a little girl? 
 

A: For me , I thought it was heaven. And we had 
a large family. My grandparents have -- had 
six children: three boys and three girls. My 
mothe r  was the oldest of the children. So, I 
had five uncles and aunts, and some  of them
 were married. And since my mother was the 
oldest, I was treated like the 
baby, very well. The, the first,
 the second grandchild in the 
fa mily. And, and life was for me  ma rvelous. 
Summers we spe nt in a pl ace outside of 
Warsaw. It was called the Line of Otvosk trai
n. On that line were a few villages and 
some ti me s my parents would rent a house in 
one village or anothe
r and we would spend 
summers there so that my parents could co
me out for the Sabbath for the weekend and 
stay with us, with my sister and I. And, of
 course, I just recent
ly started school and 
everything was new and everyt
hing was rosy. I didn't know 
there was a worry in the 
world. Loved school, then went to, to lear
n how to dance and rhythm in Maccabee. 
Enjoyed life. Wi ntertime , skating; summer
time, bicycle riding -- and that's how I 
reme mber home. The holidays were spent in 
my grandparents' house with all the children 
around and, and favorite dishes and fa vorite cups
 and very traditiona l, very traditiona l, 

and it was just great. It  was just gr eat. 
 

01:03:15 

 

Q: Lovely. Wh at happened when the war broke out? 

 

A: Well, when the war broke out -- this was al
most the beginning of a school year when the 
war broke out, and there was approxima tely
 three weeks of bombardme nt before the 
Germans entered Warsaw, and from the rubble
 I got injured but didn't feel bad. I was 
with my fa mily and I didn't  understand what was happening until, until I heard that 

Jewish ma les are, are running away towards 
the eastern border and two of my uncles and 
my father got ready to leave. My father then
 changed his mi nd and he stayed to take care 
of the fa mily. They were going to leave, 
going towards the east, away from the Germans

and that's when it dawned on me  that some thing is wrong. But the Germans came in and 
immediate- immediately did not 
happen anything, like the sa
me week, did not. But in a 
very short time, things started happening 
-- for the whole population and not only for 
Jews. It was very bad. Orders came out al
most daily: ﬁYou mustn't do this, you mustn't 
do that. You have to give up your radios, your 
gold, your things. You're not allowed to go 
here or there.ﬂ Everyday some thing new, 
for the whole population, and it began being 
really bad for the Jews. They were singled out. We had to wear armbands, white 

armbands with a blue Star of David to id
entify ourselves. Jewish stores had to be 
identified. People who lived in Poland used to use their Jewish name  in a, in a Polish 

version, and this was forbidden. You had to
 show your real Jewish name  for easy 
identification and, therefore, persecution, beat
ings, and, and sending -- 
being sent out to, 
ﬁTo work,ﬂ so they said, and just beatings. And then Jews were not allowe d to walk on 

the on the sidewalk, only in the mi ddle of th
e streets. It became worse and worse daily. 
 

01:06:33 

 

Q: How did it affect you as a little girl? 

 

A: I was...I was all right as 
long as I was with my family
 because during this time my 
parents got in touch with a for mer teacher a
nd they -- the teacher or
gani zed a little class 
of children to come  to his house and study in
 exchange for almost anything like some  
food or clothing for his fa mily. Of c ourse, 
it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there. 

We started off with 10 children, and little by 
little, the group got sm
aller as the children 
died from hunger or were caught and killed. 
I never knew what happened, just that they 
didn't show. But this happened: One day wh
en I was on my way to, to the teacher, 
Professor Rózycki -- oh, we used to come
 separately so that the Germans or nobody 

would see that we'r e forming a group, so each one came within a few mi nutes of each 

other, and one day I was on my way and 
a few blocks away some body stopped me  and 
said, ﬁAre you going to Professor Rózycki? ﬂ 
and I didn't answer. And they said, ﬁDon't 
go there.ﬂ So I didn't go there, and I waited and 
it became clear that that ve ry morning the 
Germans came, raided his house, killed all th
e males in the family. Even his father-in-

law, who was in a wheelchair, was thrown 
out of the window. I don't reme mber how I got 
home , but I think that this was the, the time 
when my life, when I started realizing as a 
young girl what -- that some thing is happe
ning. I looked around and people were on the 
street covered with papers, bodies, near bodi
es, we re crying for bread. I was always fed, 
so I don't reme mber crying for food, although hu
nger was a constant companion. But the, 
the view of the bodies covered with paper, 
the swollen bodies, wa
s bad. I had more time 
to look around and see it. When I was busy in school, I was busy.  
 

01:09:35 

 
We had classes the whole day and then home work, and it kept us busy. But then when 

this was gone, I could see --look around me , and I could see 
everything. I lost my friends 
to hunger. I, I saw people -- bodies -- being take
n away in a little ca
rriage, hand carriage, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086

and there was nothing that I coul d do fo
r anybody, nothing. There was a former teacher, 
Pani
2
 Kami nska, who was our music teacher in school and she tried to form a, a choir 
under those circumstances. It was unbelievable 
how our people tried to keep up the spirit, 
and how people know that when you're lear
ning, when you're  ﬁdoing,ﬂ you can, you can 

withstand hardship. May be easier or ma y 
be, ma y be harder, but it enables you to 
continue. You don't get necessarily wrapped 
up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your 
being cold, or whatever. And we tried very
 hard, but it became impossible. It became  
impossible. Very soon thereafter we got orders
 to move: all Jews have to move into 

certain streets or rather remove the mselves 
from certain streets in, in Wa rsaw, and there 
were some street s that were we were allowe
d to move to and we had to move. We  were 
allowed to -- my parents had a 
store right across the street from
 our apartment, so in order 
to move fast  like we were ordered many -- mu
ch of our belongings were put in the store 
and little by little we would carry to the new so
-called apartment.  
 

01:12:30 

 
And one day before we knew it, we woke up and the gates of the ghetto were closed, 

everybody trapped. And I didn't realize it then bu
t I did realize that 
there were so many 
people walking in. Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller area 

and also there were people brought in from
 other places into Warsaw ghetto, and 
therefore there were so ma ny peopl e and so
 ma ny hungry and dead and cold people and 

there was nothing that anybody can do. Now th
e Germans daily would go out and catch 
people in the street, take
 them to what they called the Umschlagplatz
3
, put them in trains 
and send them out. As a ma tter of fac t , at
 the beginning, one of my aunts who had a 
husband and a son a year older than I was when
 they saw the advertising that the, the 
Germans put out that anybody who come s on hi
s own to that Umschlagplatz will be 
treated well and sent to a camp 
for the duration of the war. My
 aunt packed for them their 
belongings and -- like bags -- and she got th
em there without knowi
ng where they were 
going. Never saw them again and after a while we
 started hearing that
 that those people 
are not being sent to work. And you know, nobody wanted to believe. People 

were–started jumping off trains if they could. 
Whether they get shot 
or  not ,  t h e y  t r ie d. 
And more and more we started hearing that
 that people are bei
ng brought to camps and 
never heard from afterwards. To me, it wa
s unbelievable. Nobody told me  anything, but I 
could hear the adults talking among themselves. So it became worse and worse and then 

after they caught everybody in 
the streets, they started cl
earing out building by building. 
They ma de unannounced visits and called 
everybody to come down and be ma rched 
away. They also organized some  factories. 
I reme mber I -- I was in one. I always looked 
older than I was and somehow my aunt, my
 aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I 
worked. This was after they took my  parents away.

Q: Back up a little bit and tell us
 what happened to your parents. 
 

A: Well, my pa rents...my parents perished se parately. They -- when the Germans organized 
factories, everybody had to register and go to 
work, which they did, but then one day they 
ma rched off everybody from the factory and that's
 how my fa ther got caught. He went to 
work, never came back. The whole group was ma
rched to Umschlagplatz and sent away. 

My mo m, she went out one morning to see if
 she could exchange some  clothes for some  
food for the fa mily and she got caught on the 
street and sent to Umschlagplatz. Never 
saw her again. Now, my older si
ster -- we, we then had to 
mo ve again twi
ce after, after 
that. And at that time, my ol
der sister and I, we went w
ith, with my grandmother, my 
aunt, and my aunt's little boy. We  were li
ving in Muranowska, and one day when the 
Germans came in to look for us, we had, we ha
d hiding places. We  had -- well, I have to 
go back and describe the hiding place. In this
 building, like in ma ny 
buildings in Wa rsaw, 
the outside walls are very thick and there wa
s no refrigeration at that time , so usually 
underneath a window there would be a little cab
inet that served as a refrigerator. The 
buildings we re ma de of stone and therefore 
keeping things cool a
nd the walls are very 
wide. We  were, we were in such a building a
nd at the time  my  grandmother, my aunt and 
her little boy would sit right underneath in 
the, in the little 
cabinet underneath the 
window, and I put a chair in front of it so nobod
y notices there is a door. Then there was 
a folding bed that folded up to look like a tabl
e with a ma ttress inside
 and my sister went 
inside, and I folded the bed and I threw some th
ing over it so that she cannot be noticed. 
And I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs 
to the attic and hide 
in the attic, but by the 
time all that was done there was no time to go to 
the attic, so I went to the little bathroom 
which had a shelf. Where I sit now across was 
a shelf, up high, and on the wall that they 
had a ladder standing there for whatever re
ason. I jumped on top of the shelf in the 
bathroom and there was the bulb, the light. I 
quietly unscrewed the bulb and I ma de s ure 
that my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly. We l l , the Germans came in and 

they found my sister–.So that's  how 
I lost my parents and my sister. 
 

01:20:40 

 

Q: What did you do when the Germans left?  They had taken your sister? 

 

A: Yes. We , we  heard some  shots and, and, s
ee, my aunt and my  grandmother could see 
through a little ventilator that was in the wall,
 but they didn't tell me  anything, but I heard 
from neighbors that they have shot my sist
er, but I don't know for sure. Over the years 

I've been trying to find her. You know, just
, just the possibility...right?  Nobody told me  
for sure. So that's how I lost them. 
 

Q: What happened after that incident
?  Where did you go?  What did you do?  
 

A: Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who wa
s ma rried and -- to a Polish lady, and she was 
with him in the ghetto all the time. They lo
st a son to, to illness and my ot her uncle 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086

together with his brother decide
d -- and my aunt -- they deci
ded that some thing has to be 
done and we have to leave, so they we nt 
out and they found an apartment some where, 
very inexpensive with one bedroom and, first,
 her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle, 
came out to live in that  apartment. 
 

Q: Excuse me  -- you're saying they found an apartment outside the ghetto. 

 

A: Outside of the ghetto, oh, yes. 

 

01:23:10 

 

Q: How -- can you explain how did they find 
it?  They were not allowed to go out. 
 

A: Well, they smuggled themselves out with a 
group of people that was going to work, to 
labor. There were factories -- there were places
 where, outsi de of the ghetto, where Jews 
were ma rched to every morning and brought ba
ck to the ghetto every night, and they 
worked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you 

could. I heard that you could some times find 
either a nice or a greedy soldier who was 
watching and for some  money would let some body 
out. I haven't witnessed it that but just 
heard. I know that my uncle would go out with
 a group of people. They were going to, to 
a factory that used to belong to a family pe
rson like a cousin or of, of the fa mily's  who 
had a factory of, of electric chandeliers, a
nd the Germans took it ove
r, and I think that 
they kept him as a ma na ger or some thing, or as a fore ma n, and groups were comi ng in to 

work. They probably switched their chandeli
ers. They didn't do chandeliers, only did 
other things in there, but it 
was still some thing. So the groups were comi ng in and out and 
he could go out, smuggle himself out and then 
two brothers and one brother's wife. My 
uncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle 
Mietek, who was single,
 and my Aunt Zosia 
had brothers there who apparent
ly helped them find an apartment and it was all in Aunt 
Zosia's na me. That's why it was a small ap
artment, and they ma de a double wall over 

there. In the little bedroom they ma de 
a double wall and that's where later on my 
grandmother went out this way into that apartment. My uncle came to pick them up, a nd 

then my aunt went, and...with 
a baby, little Jakov, who was born 
in May of '39 just before 
the war started. And little by li
ttle, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my 
other aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my
 Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband 
and son on the on the trip, well, she was a 
nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle 
came to take her out, and she refused to go. 
Apparently, she knew there were rumors, 
must have been rumors about the, the revol- 
the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be 

there and besides by that time 
she realized that her husband 
and son are dead, so she did 
not want to leave. Anyway, it was decided 
that I go out, so my uncle took me  out. 
 

01:27:20 

 

Q: Can you describe to me  what 
Wa rsaw was like at that point? 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
6 
 
 
A: Oh, when, when I left the Wa rsaw ghetto, th
ere we re still some bu
ildings there staying, 
standing. The, the ghetto was, 
was -- there was very few pe
ople -- not, not more people. 
Most people were either in the factories or 
gone from the factories, and on the street you 
didn't see anybody. You couldn't. When, when I 
left Wa rsaw a year later to go to camp, 
that's when Warsaw looked terrible, all burn
ed out. But when I left ghetto it was still 
standing and the revolt started 
and after it was finished, I 
took a -- when I was outside I 
was able to, to ride in a tram, tramwa y 
around the walls and I saw it burning, and I saw 

the airplane comi ng and bombing it, and I saw 
it all burning, and I c
ouldn't  even shed a 
tear. You become  so strong. I never thought a
bout it, but you become  so s t rong. The, the 
survival Œ the urge to survive become s number on
e priority, and I just looked at it and my 
thought was that I mustn't cry because othe
r people will see me . Unreal, but true. 
 

Q: Let us go back. Now you're still in the Wa rsaw ghetto. 

 

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Tell us about when you were smugg
led out and describe it, please. 
 

A: Oh... 

 

Q: What year and months are we in, about? 

 

01:29:35 

 
A: Ok, the approxima te time I can know, because
 my birthday was in March and I reme mber 
when my uncle told me  the story how it was 
decided that I come  out of the ghetto. It 
seems my uncle spoke to his wife, Zosia, and he told her that it's my birthday and I'm a 
young child and so on, and an invitation was i
ssued for me  to come  out. So my other 
uncle, his brother, Uncle Mietek, he came back
 into the ghetto and he is the one who took 

me  out. We  went with a group of workers,
 night shift. And we ma rched, ma rched 
together and we were ma rched through the 
streets to that factory on....I think it was on 
Grzybowska Street...that factor
y that belonged to, to this
 relative of ours. I even 
reme mbered his name but I can't  recall it 
on the spot -- Gruszkiewicz, Gruszkiewicz. 
Well, we -- finally, the whole group went in in
to the big door or gate
 and in front it was 
empty only you had to go through a -- well, it 
is like, like the building is all around and, 
and is–in the center is empty. So they had to 
go to the other side and the workers walked 
through this gate into the factor
y. My uncle and I went into the 
staircase on the side of the 
front which was empty, and I reme mber we sat 
there quietly the whole night. It was very 
cold. It was some ti me  in March. It was very cold.  
 

01:33:55 

 
We sat there the whole night because of the cu
rfew and in the morning we carefully, very 
carefully ma de our way to the apartment of
 my aunt and uncle. We  were stopped on the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
7 
 
 
way by somebody who wanted money who felt he
 recognized us. My uncle took care of 
it. I was just numb. I was just numb. But we finally reached the, the apartment there and I 
saw my grandmother and my aunt and at that  time my little cousin was not ther e anymore 

because they found a place for him with a Po
lish woman whom, whom -- who was paid, 
and she was also very, very good. She took care 
of him. He wa s like 
three years old, three 
and a half. And it was quite, quite
 a risk to take a little boy 
of three and a half. And she 
took the risk so she, she took care of the 
little boy in her room. She only lived in one 
room. Everything together -- the 
kitchen, and was, was a little 
stove there. That's  all. And 
she took care of him. And she was not rich. 
She was some thing. So when I got to that 
apartment, I saw my uncle, my two a unts, my 
grandmother, and I must say that that I felt 

kind of safe. Little did I know 
that...that we weren't safe at all, but that's how I felt.  
 

01:34:05 

 

Q: How did you live in that apartment for the next two weeks? 

 

A: Oh, we didn't, we didn't stay there too long. As
 I said I felt safe but it was not very safe  
because in a very little time, soon a fter we 
got there, after the curfew there was a knock 
on the door and some  agents came in. They spoke Polish. They must have been German 

agents that knew Polish. You know, there were
 some people there they call themselves 
Volksdeutche ,
4
 but they, they spoke Polish very we ll. I don't know who they were. They 
were civilians, but I remember they wore
 boots, high boots. They came in and they 
looked and they found a little trap door and they 
got us all out. Oh, yeah. So, it wasn't  that 
safe as I thought. 
 

Q: What did they do with you? 

 

A: Well, they wanted to take us to, to the au
thorities. My Aunt Zosia, she begged them and, 
and she did everything she could and they would 
talk only to her. They wouldn't talk to 
anybody else, and whatever possessions there we
re, they took it all 
in exchange for an 
agreement that in the morning ri
ght after curfew lets off, we'l
l all disperse, and they don't 
want to see us anymore. So that's what happe
ned. We  just had to leave. And from that 
time, each, each of us had a different story to 
tell. Well, Adolph (ph), 
my Aunt Zosia,and 
Uncle Janek -- they both survived. My uncle
 Janek lives in Warsaw. He™s ma rvelous, 
he™s ma rvelous. Aunt Zosia died two years ago, 
I think. I went to visit when she was still 
alive. My grandmother didn't survive. She co
mmi tted suicide in a bathtub, in a public, in 
a public bath- bath house, after she heard that
 her son, Uncle Mietek was killed and that 
happened while I was watching. So -- 
 

01:37:05 

 

Q: You -- excuse me . You were wa
tching?  Tell me  what happened.

A: Well, after we were all dispersed, we had 
some , we had to find some  place to stay and 
Aunt Zosia took care of Aunt -- Janek, her hus
band. Uncle Mietek, he tried to take care 

of, of his sister Esther and the little boy who was with thislady, Olga, Olga her name , and 

-- and there was another young fe
llow whom my Uncle Mietek 
rescued. I forgot his name  
but he was 17 years old
5
. And at that time  he found 
through, through some acquaintances 
from before the war. They™re were some  
people that that knew us. Through them he 
found a lady with two daughters, grown daught
ers, and she Œ for, for payment, she 
decided to take us in. Her name  was Jadw
iga Rzempoluch. Can't re me mbe r  the address, 
and she took me  in. I was, I was there doing 
practically nothing, but
 one of the daughters 
had a baby, so I would play with the baby a
nd the whole fa mily smoked so I was ma ki ng 
the, the cigarettes with 
the machine -- papierosnica
6
 -- they used to have. And then one 
day, then one day when it became a little warmer, they decided that it's going to be very 

good and safe to go to their summer place. Th
ey had a summer place in St ruga which was 
on another narrow train line. There we re regular  trains and the ones, the short distance 

ones, and this was on the line of Radzymin, a
nd there was a little place Struga where they 
had a, a place and they decided to go there 
and we went there. There was, besides Mrs. 
Rzempoluch and her two daughters, one of wh
om was blond and one of whom was dark 
haired and brown eyed. The blond young lady ha
d a baby. The, the other one was single. 
Then my Uncle Mietek, the young 17 year old bo
y and I, we all went out to Struga for 
summer to enjoy the summer vacation.  
 

01:40:55 

 
And it was beautiful. We  had a nice evening, 
and we went to bed and early in the 
morning we were surrounded by Germans w
ho knocked on the doors, woke us up and 
they dema nded two Jew -- two Jewish me n 
and a Jewish woma n. 
Somebody must have 
told them, a nd at that time they took out the young fellow, the 17 year old boy...18. They 

beat him, they beat him.  They, they broke 
all his limbs before they shot him dead. My 
Uncle Mietek, he had, he had some  good docume nts, probably false, I don't know; 

some thing that was called good documents. They 
didn't beat him. They j ust told him to 
take a handkerchief and put in front of hi
s face and walk away. And the Germans were 
target shooting to shoot out his brains th
rough the handkerchief and they did. They did. 
So they couldn't find the woma n because I 
was there. They thought, they thought it was 
the dark haired daughter of Pani Rzempoluch, 
but she worked for, for the chocolate firm 
Wedl and had very good documents and they checked on it and it wasn't  her. They didn't  

know, they didn't question me . Finally they t
ook me as a hostage to Radzymin to the 
police station to find out what
 happened to the Jewish woma n or Jewish fema le or 
whatever. That's  how my uncle died.

Q: What happened to you then?  
They...did the po
lice let you go? 
 

A: Well, I was there I think two days and they
 kept questioning me . I was, what, about 14?  
They kept questioning me , and I told them that I was from, from the eastern Poland 

where the Russians are so that nobody can check
 and then they came, ca me out with a 
ma p to show where, where it is. I said I don't know how to read a ma p. Se e -- 
 

Q: You had false papers? 

 

A: I originally had but they were
 stolen out of my pocket one day and I didn't have -- so told 
them I don't  know how to read a ma p. On th
e third day they took me  across the street 
from the police station to a bar, two of 
them, Polish policemen, and they ordered vodka 
and I thought that  -- I, I didn'
t tell them anything. Whatever th
ey ask me , I said, ﬁI don't 
know.ﬂ I didn't  know anything. I was just there as
 a maid and I'm from the eastern part. I, 
I had a name  for this little town, and that's  
all I know. We ll, they ordered vodka. I, I had 
only one shot with them, and then afterwards 
when they drank and I tried to -- I spilled it 
all. I, I didn't know what to do. They asked again,  but then I heard this 
little whistle of the 
train and Radzymin was the last stop of the tr
ain so it would only go back to Wa rsaw. It 
was running between Warsaw and Radzymin. I 
heard the whistle and 
I got up to see at 
the door of the bar, the was door, and the tw
o policemen looked. I didn't say anything. I 
opened the door and I ran as quickly as I coul
d and, and I jumped in 
into the trai n as it 

started moving, yeah. I don't know if I coul
d have any guts to do that nowadays. I 
probably couldn't run either, but 
that's what happened and, and I had to hide out from the 
conductor because I had no money for ticket an
d the train arrived to Wa rsaw. Wa s close 
to curfew time , and I had no place to go, but, I go
t into a, a house and into a staircase and 
spent the night there, yeah.  
 

01:46:50 

 

Q: What happened the next morning? 

 

A: Oh, the time -- the days were like nights and ni
ghts like days. It's  r
eally hard to, to say, 
ﬁThe next morning–ﬂ or ﬁThe 
next day–ﬂ or whatev
er, but what happene
d is that I went 
back to the area where my parents and I used 
to live and I tried to find some  friends. My 
parents had a lot of friends and my grandpare
nts, my grandmother, my uncles, aunts -- 

they were living there all their lives. They ha
d a lot of friends. I went to a lady who was, 
who used to come  and talk to my mother
 for hours and hours and I thought they were 
very good friends. Pani Ada mowska , I went to 
her and she, she was afraid. She was glad 
to see me  and she told me  that she's happy that
 I'm alive, but she was really afraid. And I 
went to other places but couldn't find a pl
ace. Spent a couple of nights on, on staircases 
and, and I went to visit Pani Ola who had 
little Jakov, and she treated me  so well. She 
did. What a person. I would feel that Pani 
Adamowska, who was educated and friend, 

that she would be the one. Instead Pani Ola 
who was really plain nice, nice person -- she 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
10 
 
 
did. She let me  spend the night on the floor, sh
e gave me something to eat, and she told 
me  that there was a job open on this same  line Otvosk, which I me ntioned at the 
beginning that our family used to spe
nd summer s between Warsaw and Otvosk.  
 

01:49:20 

 
On this same line in a little
 village some body was looking for 
a ma id and I went there and 
I got hired. Yeah. That that so
lved a lot of problems. And I 
worked there for a while and I 
was able to once a week bring some  potatoes 
or bread to Pani Ola who had little Jakov, 
who, who was name d then Jacek. Jacek is now an engineer at a doctorate from, from 

Haifa Technion. He's also -- how do you sa
y?  He teaches, let's put it this way. 

Occasionally gives lectur es, that's what I want
ed to say. He lectures occasionally and he 
has three beautiful daughters and one grandda
ughter, and that was my, that's my little 
cousin. So he spent the war with Pani Ola. 
His mother also had a 
story. My Aunt Esther, 
a story all by its --everybody has a story. 
 

Q: What happened to you though?  You were 
now working, staying with Pani Ola and 
working as a ma id.  
 

A: I was working as a ma id. I was on the horse 
( p h) . I  wa s  a b l e  to, t o
 bring some things to 
Pani Ola, food. I would -- when I peeled potat
oes, I was allowed to 
take the peels and I 
would go to Warsaw to a German kitchen, give
 them the peels and they would give me  
bread. And then I think that they fed the pe
els to, to some  animals. So anyway I was 
bringing some  potatoes, bread, milk, I was l
ooking after the, the goats. I was able to do 
that, and then while be -- while I was with, w
ith, at Ola's, spending a few nights, I me t a 
person who from that day on played a big role
 in my life. She came from, from Lvov. She 
lost a husband and a child. Actually she lost
 a child. She didn't  know whe r e her husband 

was. And she came to Warsaw and some body told her to go to Pani Ola. I don't know 

how she got there, bu
t I met her there. 
 

01:52:45 

 

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Pepi. Her name  was Pepi. But I didn't know th
at because at the time she had false papers 
and her name was Emilia Boszko. I met her at Ol
a's, and I had a job. And then in, in that 
small village  near Mi edzeszyn there was a nursery school, kindergarten and some body 

told me  that there was an opening there. And 
I told Pepi that there's an opening and she 
went and she got the job. It was very, very
 hard. She did everythi
ng but she had a place 
to, to sleep and she got the job. And then she read in the paper or she found out that in 

Warsaw, in a suburb of Warsaw, Zoliborz, wa
s an opening for a cook in a restaurant and 
she went and she got the job as a cook. M
eanwhile, where I wa s, was getting a little 
uncomfortable because when I went to the 
priest on Sunday, he, he looked at me  funny. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
11 
 
 
He gave me  a, a pocketful of nuts and candy 
and he told me  that there was one God for 
everybody. He was fantastic. 
 
Q: All right. I'm going to go ahead. 

 

A: And one day he sent a me ssage to me  that I should go to another town for a couple of 
hours, and there was a raid, so I knew he wa
s a friend. Well, I probably will tell you just 
that I became a cook's helper in Warsaw in Zolibor z. 
 

Q: Ok, I want to pause, stop. We  need to cha
nge tapes at this point and then we'll go back,

Q: All right. We, you had me ntioned a prie
st. Can you tell us how you ca me to know a 
priest?  You were in Pruszkow still, right? 
 

A: No, Pruszkow -- 

 

Q: Where are you now? 

 

A: In Wa rsaw a nd around Warsaw, in Michale
n, in Miedzeszyn, in Zoliborz. We  were 
talking about that. When I fi
rst got to got to know and we
nt to church, was there in 
War s aw. 
 

Q: This is before you were smuggled out? 

 

A: No, no. Afte r. 

 

Q: This is after? 

 
A: After, right. I, I had originally -- my Uncl
e Mietek had arranged for false identification 
papers which I think I mentioned before they 
were stolen out of my
 pocke t together with 
the rózaniec,
7
 which are the pray, the beads that y
ou pray. And it was stolen out of my  
pocket in a tramway in Warsaw, and I ha
d no documentation. I couldn't get a job 
anywhere because wherever I went they want
ed docume nts and -- or my original false 
documents said that  I came fr om a little village near the Russian border and I kept up 
with it, and my na me  wa s Krystyna Maria Ka
lnowska. And it continued to be that way, 
but when my documents were stolen and I coul
dn't  get a job, I went to the authorities -- 
oh, yes. I went to the authorit
ies and they were in front. Th
ere were Polish policemen and 
there were Germans all over the place and 
although I studied German I did not tell 
anybody I knew, but I came  up to a Polish policeman and I told him that I don't have any 

documents. I can't  get a job because everybody th
inks I'm Jewish without papers. I need 
some  documents, at which point the policeman brought me  to an office and they asked 

me  for a few zloty to pay for the document, 
and I said I had no money. A few policemen 
got them together and paid I 
think six zloty 
or  whatever.

I didn't have any money and I needed the doc
uments and, and I got a real good docume nt 
so I could get a job with it and that's how I 
got it. Oh, I me t a lot of good people. I have 
trust in people. You see, when we'r e talki
ng about the Nazi era, that's  one thing. But 
when we'r e talking about people, now that's
 another thing. People 
are good. And I found 
lots of goodness in people, everywhere I we
nt. It doesn't  Œ it, it ma de no difference 
whether they were, what their religion was, their nationality, I find good people. Maybe 
I'm lucky but that's what I see. Like the doc
uments. And I felt that
 at one point that 

religion is religion, and we play
 pray to God and at the same time it's also safe to go 
Sunday to church, and I thought to myself that
 I'm gonna to pray to God. I don't have to 
name  God. Whatever itis, I'm 
gonna to pray, and I went to 
church. This was -- the only 
thing I had were churches. I went to church
 and I prayed. I didn't know how. I picked up 
a book and I read and I did what other people 
did, and pretty soon I was pretty good. And 
this priest I me ntioned before in that little 
town, as I said, I used to go Sunday to church 
and then in a little town you stop and talk and he talked to me , and I was not very 

convincing. I didn't try to be 
convincing. I was talking to a 
priest. I was more open than, 
than with anybody on the street except I didn't give myself a way willingly. I didn't state 

who I was, but he figured out and he also
 put some  nuts in my pocket for Sunday, and 
candy. But he told me  that I could get a better
 job or whatever and I didn't pay attention. I 
needed that one. But one day I got really sick, 
very sick. I broke out i
n, in skin rashes and 
that's because  I was taki ng care of a pi g and of a goat, billy goat, and cleani ng out all that.  
 

02:06:05 

 
I only owned one flannel yellow shirt which 
at daytime I put a piece of string around, was 
a dress, and at night it was a 
nightgown. And once when I wanted to wash it, I froze. I 
didn't have it. And my bed was in the kitchen 
and, on this side of the wall. The other side 
of the wall was the pig sty. And from this I 
got all kinds of rashes. I didn't  go to the 
doctor of course, but I told the priest. I thi
nk that gave me  away. 
He said, ﬁDid you grow 
up on a farm? ﬂ  And I said [nodding head ﬁy
esﬂ]. ﬁ Well,ﬂ he says, ﬁyou belong -- you, 
you don't belong on a farm.ﬂ And, and he told me  to go to the pharmacy and buy 

calamine lotion or whatever it was, and I di
d. And this is the same  priest who one day 
sent word that I ought to go 
to another town for a while. And I knew that he, he knows 
that some body must have said some thing or 
suspect and if there was a suspicion they 
would come  and check it out. So I walked to Wa rsaw, stayed at Ola's for the night and 

everything went ok, but I couldn't stay there mu
ch longer. Al so my friend Pepi was in 
Warsaw, in Zoliborz, and -- where I went to 
visi t with her, she told me there is an 
opening for an assistant cook, but there was no 
pl ace to, to stay. She had a bed in the in 
the room behind the kitchen. She's willing to sh
are it with me, and I di
d that. I went to, to 
her in Zoliborz and helped her in the kitchen 
of a restaurant. We were there, oh, couple of 
months when the Polish revolt started in '
44, and I reme mber that day. That was a tough 
day.  
 

02:09:00 

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086

It is all, it is all together , comes together 
with my aunt and her son Jacek, who was with 
Ola. It happened to be my day off, and I we
nt to my aunt and she was at that time on the 
other side of River Vistula. They call it now 
Vistula but it's Wi sla, really, on -- in Praga. 
It's not Prague, Czechoslovakia. It's the part 
of Warsaw that's  called Praga. She was there 
as a ma id and I helped her arrange it. A
nd another good soul, another gorgeous person 
did it for me. It cost money, yes. Wh atever I ea
rned in the restaurant 
as that helper's  cook 
and Pepi's salary went for it be -- 
 

Q: Went for wh at? 

 

A: He, a friend of my parents' who was worki
ng as a tram driver, conductor on the tram. I 
me t hi m on t he street one day and he wanted 
to help me . And I  told him that I need a 
place for my  aunt to st ay, and some documents, and he arranged it. His name I never 

forget because I was looking for him for ma ny years. I wanted to thank him. I don't know 

if he's  alive. Stefan Mningoc, Stefan Mni
ngoc. I get goose bumps when I think about it. 
He had a sister who lived in Praga with a 
husband and some  children, I don't re me mb er 
how ma ny. And the husband declared himself Vo
lksdeutche. Means that he gets all the 
privileges, and of course with the privileges 
become s the possibility to hire a ma id. Now 
this Stefan went to his sister after he arra
nged for my aunt a document saying that she's 
Natalia, forgot the last name. I'll reme mber
 it probably. Natalia, he arranged for her the 
documents. He went to his sister and he told
 her a story. He told her that  Natalia is a 
widow of a fellow officer in the Polish army 
and she willing to be
 the governess for the 
children and whatever because she is now a wi
dow. He told his own sister that and he 

knew that people were, were, were killed if they
 tried to help Jews a
nd yet he did that for 
my aunt. He told me  it was for my pa rents 
and for my sister that
 he's doing that.  
 

02:12:40 

 
And she wo- she worked there as a maid a
nd on that day when, when the Polish revolt 
started. I had a day off, and I went to visit 
her across, walked across the bridge and she 
had given me a sweater which she knitted for he
r son, little Jakov -- little Jacek -- and she 
-- and I -- said ﬁYes, I'm going there.ﬂ She 
says, ﬁWould you take it to my son?ﬂ And I 
took the sweater and I visited with her first a
nd I took the sweater, and I we nt back to the 
bridge to visit Ola with my little cousin and 
brought the sweater. And then I went back to 
Zoliborz to the restaurant  where I was, and as
 I came  back the shots started. And the, the 
Polish revolt started. It was '44. I think Octobe
r 1, if I'm not mistak
en. I hadn't seen them 
until after the war because -- 
 

Q: By ﬁthem,ﬂ you m
ean your aunt --  
 

A: My aunt or my cousin, her son. You wanted
 to know how a bout my grandmother, I think 
you asked. Oh, no. I did say -- I did tell you 
that she committed suicide when she found 

out that my Uncle Miatek was killed.  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
15 
 
 
Q: I'd like to go back now. You're talking 
about the beginning of the Polish revolt in 1944. 
Can you tell me  what that day was like? 
 
A: Well, I can tell you what it was for me.  

 

Q: Ofcourse. 

 

02:14:50 

 

A: It was a day that I had the 
time off and I went to visit my aunt and my cous in and came 
back in quite a good mo od because I saw them. They were safe. They were alive. I ga ve 

them, each one of them, r e gards so I was ki
nd of a contact. They were not seeing each 

other. So the mood was elated and I came  back
 to Zoliborz, to the 
restaurant and I told 
Pepi all about it. Of cour se, we had to communicate very discreetly because the owners 

of the restaurant coul dn't find out that we know
 each other from before or who we are. So 
the -- that day was good. When the shots star
ted, I didn't know what it was all about but 

this Stefan who arranged for my aunt to stay 
with his sister, he cam
e in that day to the 
restaurant, and he said that th
ere is a revolt going and he's in it and he won't see me  for a 
while. I never saw him since. Never again. A
nd the first day was, was pretty good for me . 
But then of course the shooting started. I ha
ve to explain that when you are with other 
people and they are shooting 
buildings with the Krajowa
8
 from across the river, you're 
scared, but you feel that you're in the same co-- position with all ot her people and that 

there is a war going on. One neve
r suggests that that when th
ere is a political war that 
some body wants to hurt civilians. But, sure, 
civilians do get hurt, so it was not bad -- 
especially when we heard after a while that the Russians are in Praga, across the river, 

and we thought any mi nute they'll come  in. 
Somebody will come  in to stop the shooting. 

Some body would free so that we don't 
have the shooting and, and nobody dies.  
 

02:17:40 

 
Well, it di dn't  happen that way because the 
Russians stopped there. They didn't cross the 

river. The, the revolt took two months and th
en we  were all captured and led through the 
city of Wa rsaw to the train that took us to 
Pruszkow, and at the time the city of Wa rsaw 

was very, very bad. We  c ould smell the smol
dering the, the, the fires but they were 
almost burned out. Mainly, we saw skeletons 
of home s, of houses. We  walked in the 
mi ddle of the road because there was a lot of 
debris and we were walked to the train and 
at that time  from Warsaw to Pruszkow. We  we
nt in cattle trains, 
but locked not closed. 
They were halfway open. Nobody thought of jump
ing or, or running away. Pepi and I, we 
looked at each other: ﬁAre we
 going or are we not? ﬂ I -- she 
said, ﬁLet's  wait a while and 
see what happens.ﬂ Little did I know that sh
e had, she had poison that she carried with 
her and she kept it for the last mi nute, if
 necessary. I found that out when we got to 
Ravensbruek and we stayed in line to go into the bath house and she asked me  while we 
                                                          
8
 Ar mi a Krajowa [Home Ar my] (Polish). 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
16 
 
 
were staying in line if, if I think that, is it 
time or not yet?  And I said, ﬁOh, let's wait and 
see,ﬂ and by the time  we  got in and we were
 ordered to strip and 
give everything away, 
she didn't have it anymore. 
 
02:20:00 

 

Q: Could you tell me  about the ar
rival in Ravensbruek, please?   
 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: And could you repeat the word 
ﬁRavensbruekﬂ so it™s on the tape? 
 

A: Yeah, well, in Pruszkow we were put on trains, and these were cat
tle trai ns, all closed, 
locked with tiny little window and we were
 taken -- I don't know if it was 10 days, two 
weeks, 12 days -- it was day af
ter day after day and night af
ter night. We  were taken and 
we stopped on the railroad, on side roads. Ma
ny times there was an air attack and the 
train had to stop. We  ha d reached one camp near
, near Berlin. I forgot the name  of the 

camp. that rumors were we were going to stay
 there and then we 
didn't stay there and 
again with the train until we reached Ravens
bruek, yeah. Of course, the conditions we re 
terrible, you know. Hardly anything, but we ma
de  it, and in Ravensbruek we stayed in 

line. We  we re political prisoners. We  were not
 Jews. We  wer e  politic
al prisoners and we 
were standing in line registering our name
s and given out numbers. We  we re asked age 
and, of course, they looked us over and I sa
id that I was 18. I was lying about my na me 
so I was also lying about my age. I wanted to
 be with Pepi. Pe pi I think wa s in her 30s. 
So I got a number and there was a red triangle 
ma de of cloth with the letter ﬁPﬂ on it for 
political prisoner. The red was for political 
prisoner and on a white 
cloth was my number, 
74073. And she was 704 -- 4074. I don't re me mb er wh
ether it was, she was first or I was 
first. I think I was first, and we got cons
ecutive numbers and from then on we had no 
name s, just numbers, and then we went to th
e bath house. We -- as I said they took away 
our clothes.  
 

02:23:05 

 
We had to strip. Everybody was shaved. I don't know by wha t  mi racle Pepi and I were 

not shaved. Until toda y I have no answer. Some
body told me that the majority of people 
had lice. I don't believe it because this is no
t why you were shaved but they did not shave 
her. They did not shave me . They left my l
ong hair and when we went to the baths, we 
really expected to die. We really did, and we
 said, ﬁWell, we could have taken the poison 
but it's gone and it probably won't take longer 
with being gassed.ﬂ We ll, we were very 

surprised when water came. And we, we really got a shower. There was even this gr ay 

soap that looked like pumi ce stone but a little
 soft er. But it wa s not gas, so we took the 
showers and we went out on the other end of 
the building and we were given the striped 
uniforms and then I understood why we wanted 
to take the poison before we went in 
because each group that went in ahead of us
, we never saw them comi ng out. We didn't  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
17 
 
 
recognize them. They were shaved
 and wearing stripes. So th
en when we got stripes and 
were getting sizes that are impossible, a bi
g person would get a 
tiny dress, a tiny, tiny 
person would get a big dress, but we came 
out alive and we had our numbers and a 
triangle and we were assigned to barracks. 
When we came into the barracks, we saw on 
the wall Jewish writing, names, mess ages, ma
ny of it in Yiddish which I couldn't read, 
but Pepi could and she told me  they were na
mes. She read them to me and I, I could 
understand. I just couldn't  read 
or write, and she told me  there were me ssages, very, very 
heartbreaking me ssagesand na
me s of the people: ﬁ We–we 
were here. We™re the last. 
Tell others to reme mber us.ﬂ It, it was very 
sad, but we were ushered to those barracks 
and we were not killed. We, we had these st
raw ma ttresses, three in a row high and we 
stayed there until they sent us to another camp. 
 
02:26:15 

 

Q: Ravens- how long were you in Ravensbruek? 

 

A: Well, I have to figure it out. We  went to 
Ravensbruek at the last day of the Polish revolt 
which was October, November, and in Rave
nsbruek we must have been, December, 

December, January, and then we were, we were
 sent to a camp in a forest Wildbou ne ar 
Brandenburg. 
 

Q: Let's stay in, in Ravensbruek. You were ther
e for more than a few days, which is the only 
thing --  
 
A: Yes, but a short time  and then I was staying 
longer in the other camp, in the in the forest. 
 
Q: Can you tell me  a little more 
about what Ravensbruek was like? 
 

A: Ravensbruek was a very huge camp and ther
e were inmates from many, many nations. In 
the short stay I could notice truck-fulls of
 bodies -- how skinny, just bones and skin, 
bodies, dead bodies. They had, they had a 
place where they hung people. I did not 
witness any, any hangings but they, they 
had a pl ace and I could see the trucks going 
back and forth with bodies here and bodies 
there. We  did not do much over there. We  
were then transported to a
nother camp. And that was in 
a forest and it was a smaller 
camp, and we were building this railroad tracks 
for, for a narrow or a short distance train. 
It was very cold. We  we re ma rched every morning, after what we call Apell
9
 time. We 
were marched to work. Were putting the, the 
railroad tracks and the ties and while we 
were doing that, while we  were ma rching, we
 were guarded by SS people, me n and 
wome n with dogs and when we got there they 
would, we would ma ke a fire so they could 
stay and keep warm while we were working 
and worked. Towards the evenings, we were 
comi ng back and we would get watery soup, or 
water, whatever. In that camp was really 
bad.

The, the, the SS me n and the SS women, they
 were beating everybody they could see and 

the, the terrain was wet. They would put 
people face down and, and just stomp on them 

and beat them. I saw once thing like that. 
After this railroad thing, one day I was 
transferred to another barr- to a barrack where 
they had a factory and they told me  they 
are parts for airplanes, 
but all I saw was little
 screws or little small items that you had to 
punch holes in and they told us how to do it,
 so I immediately asked if my mother could 
come , too. It was really not safe to do that, 
but I did and they said, ﬁYes,ﬂ so Pepi and I 
were brought, worked in that factory and she 
was working there testing. You have to test 
if they are good or bad, and most of them 
were bad, really, but we had to, we had to 
produce something because the foreman tried to
 be nice to, to us, 
not to beat us or 
anything, and we all tried to back him up and he 
had some  quota to fulfill. If there is so 
and so much bad output, then he would be puni
shed, so I reme mber Pepi was telling me  
that she was checking and she was saying, ﬁMake good ones, ma ke bad ones, whatever.ﬂ 

And we wor ked there 12 hours a day. 
 

Q: You said you had convinced the guards 
to let you bring your mother. You were 
pretending --  
 

A: Not the guards, the, the, the ma nagers of it, yeah.  

 

Q: You pretended that 
Pepi was your mother? 
 

02:32:00 

 

A: Yes, yes. It so happened th
at during all this time that I me
t Pepi, she tried to protect me  
and I tried to protect her. She lost her own 
child and apparently she felt she wanted to 
help. She, she was an outstanding person. To 
describe her, I probably couldn't. That's  
how good she was, and for everybody to everybody -- to humanity. On my side, she, she 

had dark hair, brown eyes, and she looked 
Jewish. I don't know what it means to look 
Jewish but that's what the stereotype is, 
look Jewish. On the other hand, I didn't very 
much. And I felt that  in this respect if I say 
she's my mother, she will gain fr om it. I could 
have ma de a mi stake. I don't know. I think 
this wa s behind my thinking and it worked 
some how. So we were there, and, and be ing together with some body you care for was 

excellent. At the evening, Pepi would teachme  history, ma th, and she would talk to me  

about her husband, who mi ght be alive. By the way, she found him after the war. He 

survived, yes. And Pepi was teaching me  a lot.
 We, we didn't have a piece of paper or a 
pencil, but she would teach me  a French song 
or geography, explaining 
things. It helped a 
lot. It helped a lot. I, I felt real good, and when you when you feel good, you're with 

some body, you care for some body, it ma kes you f
eel good; and Pepi 
cared for everybody, 
Pepi cared for everybody. One day I saw Pepi 
doesn't  eat her portion of bread and I said, 
ﬁ What you -- ? ﬂ  She says, ﬁI was hungry. I ate 
already.ﬂ No she didn't. There was a Pani 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086

Arova who was very, very sick. A wife of 
a Polish ma jor who we knew fr om Zoliborz, 
where we worked in the restaurant. I think 
she lived in the same  
apart- building. Pepi 
found her and since she was elderly, Pepi gave
 her her portion of bread, but she wouldn't  
tell me  about it, and sure enough when I f
ound out I said, ﬁThen we'll share mi ne,ﬂ and 

she said ﬁNo, you're a young child. You have to survive.ﬂ I mean, I had problems with, 

with this that she would give
 away everything to everybody.  
 

02:35:35 

 
She was just fantastic. What a human being. 
I'm not the only one who, who gained by her 
being around, who gained so much of everyt
hing, of understanding, of
 love, of helping 
others. She was just fantastic. So then we 
were in the camp and we heard some  rumor s 
that the war is comi ng closer. But we didn'
t know anything. This forema n apparently he 
also felt that Pepi was a nice and a good pe
rson, a worthwhile. He some how let her know 
that things are going better for us. In othe
r words, things are not going so good for the 
Germans, and at one time he gave her a pi
ece of paper and a pencil so that she could 
teach me something. She wanted to teach me 
some thing to write and, and he, he did that, 

but we had to give it back right away, so 
we knew that some thing is, is happening, but we 
didn't know what. And, and the hope was really 
making us imagine better things, so one 
day -- it must have been again in March or 
April, in March, I think, March of '45 -- they 
put us in trains and they sent
 us to so-called ﬁFree work.ﬂ 
Each one was assigned to some  
deserving Ge rman fa mi l y or on a farm to work and this, Pepi and I we were assigned to 

two villages not far from each other in the 
northern part of Germany near Rostock. I was 
in Külingsborn, and she was in Bornhagen. A
nd we were there until May, I think, 5. We 
were liberated by the Russians,
 who didn't believe that we 
did not cooperate with the 
Germans. It, it was hard for them to unders
tand because we were working here on, for a 
fa mily or for a farmer so they, they just 
didn't believe that about a month or six weeks 
ago we were taken out of, of concentration 
camps and, and put there for whatever reason, 
I don't know. And that's where we, we were liberated. 
 
02:38:45 

 

Q: What did you do?  What happened to you? 

 

A: Well, Pepi ma de out. Pepi ma de out little, 
called a little -- a travel  document, in Russian, 
and she put some  sta mps, different colors rubb
er stamps that mean 
nothing in German or 
whatever, whatever she could find in the farmer's , in the farmer's place and the, the 

Russian that occupied the farm that she 
was, they stayed there. They made it a 
headquarters, and in a couple of days I came running to her because where I was, was 

terrible, so I stayed with her and she ma de out  those papers and she told the Russians that 

we want to go back home. One of them, quite an intelligent fellow, he says, ﬁWell, why 

don't you go to Russia. Your daughter will 
go to school and, and you'll be fine and I'll 
write to my commandant to, to
 arrange for you.ﬂ So Pepi as
ked me , ﬁDo you want to go 
to Russia?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo. I, I want to go ho
me  and see if I can find some body alive.ﬂ So 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
20 
 
 
she, she said, ﬁ We'll have to th
ink about it, want to see who 
is alive.ﬂ And they said ﬁOh, 
you can find out from there, too. Just go to 
Russia.ﬂ Anyway, Pepi got some  kind of a  
carriage that took us, horse and buggy, that t
ook us out and with those papers that she 
prepared, we got ourselves to Berlin. And wh
en we got to Berlin there was a a Jewish 
office on Rikostrasse (ph), a Jewish office wher
e there were DPs, and we went there to 
register to, to say that, ﬁWe 'r
e alive, we'r e here, and what 
next? ﬂ  And the 
funniest thing 
happened: when I when I was interviewed by th
e interviewer on Rikostrasse in Berlin, he 
didn't want to believe that that I was Jewish.  
 

02:41:20 

 
I had problems convincing him, but I could prov
e it. I could prove it with the name s and, 
and what little I knew. It was, the name s 
of my family and, and we had a conversa- a 

lengthy conversation ‚til, ‚til he believed me . 
And we stayed in Berlin for a while. That 

was another chapter that was very heartb
reaking, however, nobody was getting ki lled and 
that was the good part. And the Allies brought
 some food and some clothing and people 
were looking for each other. It was just like drunk with freedom. Everybody was drunk 

with freedom but looking, ﬁ Who–who is alive?
 What do we do? ﬂ But this was the good 
part of it. The bad part of it is that I di
dn't find anybody when I tried to go back. Tried to 
go back and, and didn't find anybody. That was 
bad. Later on I found my father's brother 
in England with his family. I found my youngest
 uncle in Israel who went there before 

the war as a khalutz,
10
 and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in 
Russia survived, and then they found little Jace
k, and they came to Israel as a family. 
And that was some thing out of this world.  
 

Q: So when you -- can we come  back to you now?  What did you do?  Where did you go? 

 

02:43:45 

 

A: I, I was in Be rlin, as I said, with Pepi, a
nd we me t there. Actually Pepi, she saw all ki nds 
of people from, from the Jewish community a
nd they were also American Jews, English 
Jews, French and Russian -- in all the armi es. 
That was before Berlin was, was divided by 
a wall; it was all open. And Pepi, as usual, deci ded to, to help out others, so she had me 

do things to help out others 
and people who came  let's say from Russia or from a ca mp , 
needed to stay over or go some where or get so
me  clothes, being sent being sent wherever 
they wanted to. So the majority wanted to go 
to, to the west. Pe pi was there to help. Oh, 
yeah, Pepi was there to help, 
and being with her you couldn't he
lp but help others. It was 
great to be able to do some thing that you wa
nted to do, to be able to say, ﬁYes, you can 
go. You're fr ee. Where do you want to go?  You can go. You'r e  hungry, here™s food,ﬂ you 

know?  There was a Jewish holiday where they ha
d in Berlin. I'll never forget that. Pepi 
invited all the Jewish people from all the ar
mi es. She says, ﬁI don't care if they are the 
French Army, the Russian Army, the Am
erican -- it's a Jewish holiday.ﬂ

02:45:25 

 
They all came together and what a meal. I think each one brought some thing with them 

because we didn't have much and we had candles and they pr ayed, and it was a holiday. I 

mean, that was after all the, the things th
at we we nt through, there was a real Jewish 
holiday which was celebrated. I couldn't commun
icate with most of 
them. Learned a little 
Russian in concentration camp, but Pepi knew 
languages, but it didn't ma tter. You could 
communicate. And you could help. And that wa
s great. It was great. 
It was like ecstasy. 
It's  just later on that everything come s out, when you find out that you don't have 

anybody anymore and it settles in. I find that we
 all carry with us, the survivors I me an, 
we carry with us a certain some thing. I can't  
put my finger on a certain
 part in our brain 
that is different from eve r
ybody else in the world who did 
not go through what we did. I 
think that I can recognize a su
rvivor probably from across the 
street, or at least when we 
exchange a fe w words. There is some thing abou
t us that I don't  find in any other people; 
ma ybe the, the sad look in their eyes or ma
ybe some expressions. I don't know what it is. 
And we all carry that and ma ny times  our childr
en do that, too. they, 
although they didn't  
go through the things we did, they'r e a part of
 it. They suffer from not having uncles and 
aunts and cousins. They suffer because their 
parents are overly protective. They suffer 
from it. They do it. I get a phone call from my 
kids every week, whether I need it or not, 
because I can't live otherwise. 
This is, this is the leftover from, from knowing where they 
are, knowing that they are all right. I wish 
I could change, but I can't . They have to 
understand that that's what I need. They do understand it but it's, it's an imposition on 

people. People shouldn't have to do that. So, 
my generation and our children, they carry 
the burden. Hopefully, we won™t have that th
ing happen again and, and the grandchildren 
will not ne ed to, to carry the burden. They, they ca n lear n fr om history what happened so, 

so they can prevent it in the future, but 
they shouldn't need to carry a burden. Nobody 
should.  
 

02:48:50 

 

Q: I™d like -- indeed -- I'd like to come
 back to know how you got to Bergen-Belsen? 
 

A: Oh, well, I got to Bergen-Belsen after the war fi ni shed. We start off in Berlin where Pepi 
and I stayed and helped. And, of
 course, there were for Pepi, helped in a in a orphanage 

and tried, at that time there were, the British wa
nted to take the orphans out to the British 

zone. They st arted ma king the zones, Fr
ench zone, British zone , you know, and Pepi 

registered me in the orphanage, and I went 
to the orphanage so that one day the British 
came with a truck and they told
 us to sit down in the truck 
and they took us out. What I 
didn't know then which I found out later was th
at some  authority got -- found out that 
Pepi's  helping ma ny DPs  and even some  soldie
rs from, from a different army who did not 
allow their people to, to move, but they 
wanted to, to go. And she was helping and 
some how they found out and they came  looking for her at night and she ran away. She 

knew that she was being hunted at th
at time , so she sent me  away. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
22 
 
 
 
Q: Ok, Let™s take -- I need to go back in th
e truck, you are now loaded into a truck. Where 
are you taken?   
 

A: Oh, we were taken first, first we were 
taken, I think we stopped at Hanover. We  stopped 
at Hanover, and then we were
 taken to Bergen-Belsen, or 
was it the other way around?  I 
can't  reme mber. 
 

Q: Can you tell us what was Berg
en-Belsen like at that time ?  
 

02:51:10 

 

A: Bergen-Belsen was another orphanage, and I 
was just talking to -- it was Block RB-6 was 
the orphanage where there were some  orphans and they brought us in 
to together so that  
they could care for us. And, of course, ma ny 
people were ecstatic, they found each other 
but I couldn't find anybody I knew. I didn't know
 too ma ny pe ople before the war started 
and so I couldn't find ma ny people and they ca
red for us very well in Bergen-Belsen, but 
it was all after the war. It, it was --  the burden was already ther e. 
 

Q: Is this where you me t Hadassah? 

 

A: Yes, yes. That's where I me t Hadassah, right. 

 

Q: Can you tell me  what she was 
doing?  Could you repeat her name ?  
 

A: Hadassah Rosensaft. Well, at that time, wh
en I was in Bergen-Belsen, her name  was Dr. 
Bi mko, and there was a gentlema n by the name  of
 Yasala (ph) Rosensaft, and they were 
caring for the DPs, the displaced pe rsons. I 
know that much, and I reme mb er they got 
ma rried. However, I did not -- I wasn't  ther
e apparently when their son was born. I found 
that out muc h later. And we kept in touch 
throughout the years but 
not very close and not 
very often. Her ways were, were
 different from mi ne although 
we lived also in Manhattan 
afterwards. I had two children 
to raise. I had a job and our
 ways are not the same  but 
whenever there was something going on where survivors me et, she was there and I was 

there and some how, even if we didn't talk or
 we just acknowledged, we were there. It's  
funny. We  were there --  
 

Q: I'm sorry. I'm going to have to interrupt 
you because of time. Can 
you tell me  when you 
came to the United States? 
 

02:53:55 

 

 

A: I came to the United States in November of 1955.  

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
23 
 
 
Q: Who ca me  with you? 
 

A: My dear husband, Ike.  

 

Q: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Back up. Where did you me et Ike at? 

 

A: Oh. 

 

Q: We have to be short here. 

 

A: Ok, well, from Bergen-Belsen a short, shor
t trip, we™re sent to Blankenese, which is 
another place for the orphans. From Blanke
nese, we went to Ma
rseilles where we 
boarded a ship, 
Champolion,
 that brought us to Egypt. Now Hadassah was on it. I didn't 
know that because my Pepi was putting in
 on Champoulyan. Pepi was adding people who 
didn't have any papers. Approxima tely 10 befo
re us went up, went on board before I was 
allowed to board it, so many, ma ny illegal -- bu
t we, we got there, and it was impossible 
to see each other on the, on the ship. Many 
people and overloaded and all that, but we 
ma de the trip and we got there. And as Ha
dassah explained, we were
 divided into three 
groups. Each one went to a different kibbutz.
 We were studying. We  were working and 
we were also semi -drafted, ala cub scouts, ex
cept we were trained 
with rifles and, and 
grenades and night, night exerci
se, combat exercise. then of
 course we had the Wa r of 
Independence. After the War of Independence,
 I went to England to see my uncle, my 
father's  brother, and he wanted to adopt me  but
 I wanted to go back to Israel. And when I 
came back from Israel, I met Ike wh
om I married two years later.  
 

Q: Then you came  to the United States? 

 

A: We ca me  to the United St ates with Ike 
and with a little 18-mon
th old son, and Ike's 
parents were here in New York. We  lived with
 them and then with another little boy born 
in New York City in Mt. Sinai Hosp
ital, right. And th
at's the story. 
 

Q: Quite a story. Doris, can you tell me  what 
you think the effect of the Holocaust has been 
on you, of going through all that? 
 

02:57:15 

 

A: Never thought about it, what
 the effect is on me . My children and my husband, they tell 
me  that I'm a strong lady and I think that if 
it is true, then this would be one result. The 
effect is that I am probably overl y sensitive to people's opinions, to people's behavior, 

and I'm cons tantly on the watch about safet
y, about wars, about slanderous talking. I'm 
more sensitive to that, I think, as a result. 
I also find that tellin
g your story and telling 
what you feel towards people, which is ma in ly good stuff, love, people are good if they 

know it but if they are fed different infor mati
on and they don't know any better, they can't  
behave any better. I, I feel that that I can, 
that I can explain or like people more than I 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0086 
24 
 
 
could before the war. I'm closer to, to ev
erybody, to the whole world because of it. I'm 
also watchful . I think all this is, is the resu
lt from, from what I went through my life. 
We 'r e all, we 'r e all products of our past, and 
I think that's what the past did to me . Good, 
bad, indifferent, I don't know. That™s just me . 
 
Q: I thank you, Doris. 

 

A: I wish I didn™t have to Œ 

 

Q: Yes, ok, that™s it. We ™ve got a couple of 
pictures. Doris, thank you very, very much.
