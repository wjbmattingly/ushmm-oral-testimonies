part of the country under direct Germ an control.  Southern France rem ainedunoccupied but

1940, let's startf irst with you telling us what you know about your parents, yourf am ily, their lif e 
bef ore the war began. 
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  My father was a presserfor wom en's clothes. And m y mother was a 

seam stress,one of the best seam stress
es
 
in the world. 
 
 
Asf ar as I know, there's notm uch I could remem ber, I was 3 
years old, but as I can remem ber, we hada happy life.  I went to school.  My brothers went to 
s c h o o l.  A ll of
 
us did whatnormal people do bef orea war, anywa y. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what tookthem  to live in Turkey andthen eventually to com e toParis.

a t the  tim e  
f
o r 
P o gr om s .
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what a Pogrom  is.
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hat's when the Russiansdo whatever 
they 
f eel like when the Jews got in 
their way.  In other wor ds, they beat them up,killed them ,and nobody said anything.
 
T hey went toT urkey to escape this.  My f ather m etm y m other inT urkey.  T here's a little story 

about how he ended up

>> Bill Benson:  I wantyou to share that.
 
>> Marr yin g m y m other.  One of m y uncles, which we hadn't seen inthepictures, cam e up to 
m y nose right now, but in
 
thosedays he was ver y tiny in m y eyesi gh t.  Heactually got m adat a 
Russian that was in the Pogrom.  Andthey split him apart with an ax.  T he Russians came 

back thenext day tof ind m y uncle. And thefam ily put him  ina coffin and carriedhim out and 
said he was killed during the Pogrom .
 
 
And thenT urkey, m yfather was going out with m y mother, 
unbeknownst to me, Iwasn't there yet. W hat happened isthat he askedm y f ather, what do 
you plan to do with m y sister
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he uncle did, who had taken careof  the Russian.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Hesaid, what's your plans with m y sister
?
  
My f ather said, I'm going to 
m arry her.  Shotgun wedding. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he did.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Hedid.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas the life like inTurkey?
  
Do you know? 
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey lived in a hotel. They got theirm ail at the hotel.  In Maryland, we 

actually m et adescendantof theowner of  thehotel.  My aunts recognized them  when they 
knew who he was.  Itwas a 
f
antastic reunion.
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  Yourm other had15 siblings, I believe.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  But not all of them  lived.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. How large was the extendedfam ily betweenyour mother andfather?

>> Marcel Hodak:  My father had two brothers and one sister.T hesister lived in Brooklyn.  
Oneof  theuncles lived in the Bronx.  T he other one lived in Brooklyn.
  
T hey were ver y close.  
Ever y Sunday we used to go to the Bronx, whi ch was high up compared todown in Brooklyn.  

T he Bronx was known as the ritzy part and Brooklyn was the peasant.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Marcel, your f ather was apresser
, a
s you said.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith clothing.  Healso was self
-
educated. Tell us a little bitabouthim .
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  My father spoke several languages
, 
Russian,T urkish.  Henever went to 
school. He learned how to read Hebrew by him self . He learned how to write by him self . 

Although it was not very good penm anship, but it was readable.
 
 
W hat else would you like me to say? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sister was born inT urkey in 1921.  Your brothers cam e in 1926 and then 
another in1928. InParis you had com e along m uch later.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  I was an accident.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were an accident.  Ok.W hydid they leave Turkey, and what was 
lif e  lik e  

for them  in Paris?
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W ell, the wholefam ily on m y f ather's side andmy m other's side were all in 

T urkey. W henm y f ather got married, he decidedto go with m y m other'sf amily.  T he other 
ones wentto New York.

>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas Paris like f or Jews at thattim e, to your knowledge? 
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T om y knowledge, at thattim e we had particularstreet where all the Jews 
m et.  It still was alive whenI went back in 1956. 
 
 
W hat happened is that when the Germ ans cam e in 1940, there 
was a stipulation in there that no Frenchm anwould be hurt by the accord between the 
Frenchmen.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Petain
 
was the head of the French government.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yeah.  In 1942, the Germ ans had a decree saying that all the Jews who 
cam ef rom  the east were to lose their citizenship. T hat way when they deported them , they 
could say they didn't touch the French,they only touched thef oreign Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And
 
when your parents moved f rom T urkey to Paris, they did get French 
citizenship at thattime.  They were bonaf ideFrench citizens.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  But what happened is that I was born whilethey were citi zens, so I 

becam ea com plete French citizen whereasm y brothers were give n citizenship whenm y 
parents got it. Theirs got takenaway, but m ine didn't.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you were born in France, unlike yourparents.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Right. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we go f urther into thewar,
 
tell us what
 
--
 
to your knowledge, knowing 
how little you were, wh en the Germans camein, in May of  1940, occupied Paris. W hat 
happened thenf or your fam ily? W hat was life like?

>> Marcel Hodak:  Around1942, in Germ any1942
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before that happens. 
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  You saw a pictureof m e in what we called Luxembourg.  It was a place 
where we went to thepark. W em archeddown the big boulevards of  Paris. My father never 
hada car. Neither did m y m other. A car was a luxury that not
 
everybody could have. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And then youfound out laterfrom  your parentsthatwhen theGermansf irst 

attacked France in1940, Paris was bom barded.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you would have to go into the underground toget 
away
 
--
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  You call it underground.  Icall it a subway.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  OrMetro.
 
 
My m other ran in a panic, hadm e wrapped in the blanket
, t
he  
blanket over m e. T heblanket got hit by shrapnelandactuall
y lef t a burn on the blanket.  I 
didn'tfeela thing.  I'mstill here. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  But your parents hadto be terrif ied.
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey were scared. W eall were scared. T hey we re scared.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You talked to me thef irst time we m etaboutthat tim eand what you've learned 
since then. T he French had what they calledim aginal lines.  And that was intended to 
basically keep the Germ ans from  attacking.

>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  They did what we call
 
--
 
the Germ ans would go around the l
i ne  a nd 
cam e up the other end.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just hopped around it.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  And one of the aunts that you saw in the picture,her husband was 
woundedand was taken to a Germ an hospital.  And the Germ ans let him die with gangrene 
because he was
 
Jewis h. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm e that that period, as you're going to tell usabout, in 1942 

between theGermanoccupation in May of 1940 and1942, that generally things were relativel y 
normal f or the fam ily
 a
ndfor Jews in general.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But then in 1942,things hadchangeddram atically and your parents decide it's 
tim e to leave.
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W ell, they didn't decide.There were rumors around Paris that they were  

going to start roundups.  And inanticipatio
n of  t h a t
 
--
 
the idea was toget rid of all the Jews, to 
get outof  Paris.  My parentsdecided,among theentirefam ily
 
--
 
I think they all m ade plans.  At 
leastm y signif icantother suggested they probably discussed this and they all went down to the 
sout
h.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littlebit so we know what Vichy, France, was. 
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  It was supposed to be what they call 
F
ree France, where nobody was going 
to get pickedup,nobody was going to pay the pricefor being Jewish.  But signif icant
ly
 
--
 
t h is  
signif icantly changed when theGermans cam edown to the southof  France.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

>> Bill Benson:  Up until the tim e they did that, the understanding was they would leave 
S
outhern France alone.
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hat's correct.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So your parents decided that's where they hadto get to. 
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W ell, there were notm any otherplacesto go. Except England.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Or stay put and get deported.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Butyou couldn't go toEngland.  Jews couldnot get passports.  So stamped 

on the passport.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sof orthem  the only option was tof leeto S
outhern France and then did.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us how they did thatandwhere they went.
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W e boardeda train.  It was packed. Good thing Ididn't get lost,because 
they would never have found m e.  Everybody was jum p
in g
 
on the trains. T he people were 
standing all over the train. T here was no space. W e wentall the way down to a town.  It's ver y 

funny.  It is spell
ed
 
an
d sounds like exactly what it is. I don't know how you explain that. T he 
derrier
e .  
>> Bill Benson: T hat probably explained it.
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W egot off thetrain. And thenthey wouldn't let the Jews go back to Paris.  

T hey say all Jews are going to
 
stay at this point. The non
-
jews could go on the train and go 
back to Paris.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hywould you even want to go back toParis?

>> Marcel Hodak:  It's a question.  You wantto be where your hom eis.  And what happened is 
thatthey wouldn't let us go backhom e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm e that as the rum ors were circulating and the deportations 

began,that there were French that would denounce Jews justf or the
 
--
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Possibility of  getting the apartm ents. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T o get their home.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  It was very hard tof ind apartm ents in France all the tim e.  It still is hard 

to d a y. W hat the y
 
d id
 
to get the apartm ent, they would denouncethe peopletotheGermans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So when you couldn't return to Paris, is that when you went on to 

B ri d e

le s
-
Bains?
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hat's when we went to Bride

Bains.  My f ather found a jobas a

-
le s
-
Bains. It was a 
m ountainous town?
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Actually, Bride
-
le s
-
Bains became very f am ous in1992. T hat's where they 
hadthe Olym pics. T hey had hotels.  It was also a town where people wentfor the cure, you

know sulfur cures,bath cures,all of that stuff.

>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes, sir.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And obviously m ountainous.

>> B ill B e n s
on: W as that theA
lps? 
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T he bottom, that's
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ididn't know.  As we get intothefact that it was m ountainous, playeda big 
role probably in your survival.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  My brother belonged to underground. Their encam pm ent
 
wa s  a ll 
along the mountains. And theGermans really were not very happy to go in that area because 
they would have got shot. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the resistance, I think
 
--
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hat's what we called
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's the French resistance
, 
Les Maquisards. T ellus about that. 
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey cam e down f rom  them ountain at least once am onth with supplies
 
thatthey had gottenf rom  parachuted to them .  He broughtf ood, which we didn'thave that 

m uch of  where we were.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bride
-
le s
-
Bains was a hotbed for the resistance.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  And we were treated
 
--
 
well, we tried to assim ilatethat we belonged 
to them, asfolks of that area.  I wentto church. T here's a story thatgoes with that. 
 
I used to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

go to church with m y beret onm y head.  Andthepriest would com e, takem y beret, put iton 
m y lap.  I didn't 
know I had to take off  m y hat, put 
onm y lap.  I lef t itonm y lap.
  
C om e t o be  a  
few years, quite af ew years later, m y brother came back and said, you know the priest that put 

your hat on your lap? He was actually an underground guy.  He was spying on the town to 
m ake sure who was doing what so that during the war we could know the situation andbring 
t h em  ou t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the priest was actually a m em ber of  the resistance and he was Jewish. 
 

 
T ell us about what life was like then inBride
-
le s
-
Bains as best 
you can. This is aplace where, as youm entioned, the Germans didn't do all
-
out assaults on it.  
T he y so rt of  left ita lo n
e. W hy would they even leave it alone?
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Because actually, the people in charge of that earlier were the Italians. If 

you know them ap, you know Italy was ri ght next door. And were Hitler
 
--
 
not f or a long tim e, 
buthe gotoverthrown.  Andthat's when the Germ ans cam edownfrom  thereand started

clothes. It was m adeoutof goat skin. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W ereyou in 
h id in g in  B ride
-
le s
-
Bains?
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  You can say that. I don't rem ember wearing theJewish star at thatpoint.  
My aunts, who you saw a picture of , was in Paris.  And when they cam e down, I don't 
rem em ber anybody wearing the Jewish star.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Ithink you told me that you didn't change yournames. So you're

som ewhat clandestinebutnot really hi
dd
en, living sort of  openly.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  Openhiding. T hat'sthehardest thing tof ind. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So clearly, clearl y, people must have known you were Jews in that town. Or 
did they? 
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey m ay have, but they were more protective than they were to give awa y 
people. They knew retribution wouldbe hadby the underground. On top of that,I have one of 
m y cousins lost their parents
 
there.  She's the one that wrote thebook. 
 
 
W hat happened is that theGermans sent herlittle sister tof ind 
m y cousin. And the underground toldher that she shouldn't gobackto her cousin, her 
parents, because theGerm ans would take them all away.  T hat's how she was saved.  She 
ended up joining theunderground with m y brother.

I thought itwas all basically a gam e 
to run a

parents would be speaking in Yiddish.  And Iwould understand what they would say.  So, 
yeah, it was anexciting time.

thought were collaborationists. 
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So insom e ways I think you've explained that anybody who might hav
e been  
inclined to denounce a Jew or notf riendly to the Germ ans, they did that at risk because of the 

resistance.
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  And they paid dearly at the end of the war.

because of the resistance, there were still times they cam e intotown.

saw si x trucks parked in front of the house.  I'm  not sure that thesewere not the trucksthat 
picked up m y aunt
 
and uncle.  But they would park on the bottom of theapartm ent. And we 
were playing in the balcony. W hen we saw them, we actually ran in and hidunder atable. 

And then we heard a knock on thedoor. A

It was m ore like a banging down thedoor.

T here was nothing lef t.  Couldpick it up by asponge. The wholetown went in apanic.  But 
they couldn't do anything

to be collaborationists with the Germ ans or

that retribution would com e.
  
W e'll jum pahead toaf ter the war.  T ellus a little bitabout that.

W ell, theonly problem  was is that Am ericahad quotas during

But at thatpoint we we ren't able to get thepapers to com e to the United States right away.

tim e computers was the biggest thing that you could ever do in your lif etime.  I had beautiful 
jo b

[Laughter]
 
 
But I had a very good life.
 
>> I just noticed you speak in French and English interchangeably.  Do you ever speak French 

andnot know you're doing it, not know the difference between French and English?
 
>> B i

you're speaking French?

On the plane I did it.  Iwas watching a French m ovie. T henI

>> Bill Benson: W hatwould you do to solve things like the Holocaustf rom happening again?

> Marcel Hodak: T hat is a very good question. If  anybody knew the answer, it would bea 
wonderful world.  Theonly problem is everyb ody wants to have what the other personhas.  
W hen that stops, maybe it will work. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Goodquestion.

well, she'd get mad if  I say it.  But you really have no closenessthatyou have with your own

I didn't know I was a survivor until af riend of m ineactually 
threatenedm eto go to the m useum andtalk to them  and see if they would hire m e because I 
have 
a lot tooffer.  She remembered 
--
 
it was a childhoodf riend.  She rem em bered that Ihad 
com ef rom  France.  
 
 
A thing Iforgot to speak about is whenI got to the United States, 
I  wa s  g i v
en f ruits.  Iendedup with an orange.  I really didn't know what to do with anorange 
because I never saw one bef ore inm y lif e. Iate it like an apple. Everybody got excited.  Good 
thing I didn't do that with abanana. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
At any rate, Ididn't know I was a survi vor until them useum m ore 
or less advisedm ethat I was a survivor because of what Ihad passed through. They asked 

m eto give them  ahistory of m y lif e.  I wrotedown a lotof  what we had just discussed.  And 
they said, youare now a
 
s u r vi vo r.
 
 
My thing is, f or the young man that just asked m e the question, it 
goes along the same thing.  W hen you're in them iddle of a war or anything, you don't realize 
what's happening to you.  Andthe way to combat this thing about the Holocaust is t
o k e ep  up  
the will tof ight the prejudices that go on in the world.  
 

 
T hat's m y advice.
