GITTA SERENY 
 February 28, 2004 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gitta Sereny, 
conducted by Vera Frankel on February 28
th
, 2004, in London. This is tape number one, side A.  
Answer: Not yet?  God, I hate these tapes. 

Q: All right, first of 
all I wanted to ask you really just 
about your background, your family, your 
childhood in Austria. 

A: Oh my God. We ll, my childhood -- course in
 Austria as you proba
bly know, I didn™t stay 
there very long. I mean I -- I was born in Vienna
. My father was Hungarian, my mother German, 
and they went to Vienna, it™s nosecret really, because my fat her™s family would not have my 

mother, who was a very pretty young actress, 
mu ch younger than my father, but extremely 
pretty, well they would not have her in Hungary, not 
at -- at his place. So he
 had to give all this 
up, and he did, he gave it all up for her and bought 
a flat in Vienna, and came  to live in Vienna, 
which is -- I -- it must have been -- I didn™t 
know him, you know, he died when I was two, so I 

never knew him, but I gather he was a charmi ng 
ma n, I bet he was. But he was 30 years older 
than she. So it -- one 
can imagine, can™t one?  
Q: Let [tape break] right -- 

A: So they hear my dirty laugh all the way. We ll, never mi nd.  

Q: They hear your dirty laugh all the way. 

A: That™s their loss or gain. 

Q: So you fa ther died when you were two, but
 how were you brought up, in what kind of 
atmosphere, and what kind of ideas were you brought up with?

A: We ll, ideas, my mother didn™t have ideas, sh
e was an actress, and she 
was very beautiful, and 
she was you know, surrounded by elegant and charmi
ng me n, which was rather nice, you know, I 
rather  enjoyed that. But she was very childlike. A
nd she -- she certainly liked
 la grande vie, and 
she created this grande vie, which was, I think, brave of her. She continued to have it after my 
father died, when there was some  money, 
but not much. And when it was gone she was 
particularly brave because she spoke absolutely
 perfect English, and sh
e took to translating 
plays, which was -- course was a very, very good 
thing at the time in Vienna because they had no 

plays of their own in the 20™
s. Later, Thomas Bennett came , but there were no Austrian 
playwrights. We ll, of course th
ere we re the -- Schnitzler and ol
d ones, you know, but not modern 
ones. So all the plays came from Fra nce and En
gland, and America, too, but England was the -- 
and she did rather well, and she worked extrem
e l y hard. This I respected, I mean I -- I -- you 
know, I -- I think that I learned a lot from that, 
because I -- I -- I didn™t respect her for her 
childishness. I --I did th
ink that, you know, by the time I was 10, 
I felt that really she should be 
more grown up. But -- but I did resp
ect her staying up late, late, la
te into the night working so 
that she could get -- offer us this life, which sh
e thought was essential. Of course, I would never 
have thought it was esse
ntial. But she did. 
Q: And wha t  kind of people did she surround you 
with?  I mean, were they
 actors, were they 
pl a y wr i g ht s?   

A: We ll, they were partly actors, and partly ar 
-- aristocrats, because sh
e was very -- as I said, 
she was very -- you know, a very sort. She went out
 a lot, she had absolu
tely beautiful clothes 
made by a little seamstress fr om models. The seamstress came once a week for two days. Abso -- 

Q: As often as that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

A: As often as that. She had a lot of clothes,
 and she would go to all the sales, some time s 
dragging me  along, and buy these abso -- the re
mnants, you know, of 
bea utiful, beautiful 
materials. And this little seamstress, who was 
absolutely splendid, and was able to copy models. 
So anyway, all this, this was th
e sort of child life, until I was 
11, and then by this time  I had 
changed schools, had gone from, you know, my 
elementary school, which was a very ordinary 
state school, which I loved. I loved school anywa
y. I had gone to a riyah gimnasium, which is 
sort of -- you know, a private high school for girls,
 called Lueetlan. And -- and at 11 I was sent to 
England. My brother -- I had a 
brother who was four years ol
der than I, Guido. Guido had 
already been sent to England years before, also at
 -- no he -- he ma  -- he was sent at 12 actually, 
because my father wanted us brought up in Engla
nd, which was a very wise idea, I think. I me an, 
he also wanted us brought up in France, which also happened, so you know -- not my brother, 

but I. So I -- I was able to speak these la
nguages, you know, which is good. And then I came  
back to Vienna to go to dramatic school. 
Q: Now there™s an extraordinary incident that
 you™ve written about in 1934, when your train 
broke down as you were going b
ack to school in England. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Tell me  about that. 

A: Yes. I was -- it was very interesting, I m
ean a -- it -- it broke down in Nuremberg, and it was 
the time  of t he Nurembe r g party day. And the trai
n, they couldn™t find --- we
ll, I gath -- I gather 
they couldn™t find a train to repl ace it, so they 
had to repair it, which was going to take five 

hours. And so the -- there was anothe r child on th
is train by itself, so we were unaccompanied 
children. I was in my school uniform, which is 
brown and green, and the German Red Cross took 
us over, this little girl and me
, who was also going to school, not
 my school, but another school, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

and took us to the party day. And we were ta
ken to the -- there was 
a children™s sort of 
gallendare if you -- if yo
u know wha t  that means. I mean, it was just a -- you know, rows and 
rows of -- of -- of benches going up, all children, it was only children. And so we were taken 
way up, because there wa s -- there wasn™t any sp
ace, as you can imagine. But they put us in 
there, and I just thought it was the most beautif
ul thing I had ever seen. It was absolutely 
ma gnificent. And you know, all the --
 the -- the -- this wonderful 
rhythm and these -- these -- 
these clean looking boys and -- and girls -- I m
ean and also ma rching, you know, people. And 
then of course there were these speeches, and I 
had absolutely no idea what they were saying. I 
mean, I didn™t understand a word. But I scream
ed like everybody else. I mean, I thought it was 
just so exciting. I had never been
 so excited in my life, I thin
k. The colors, and the -- I don™t 
know, the -- the music, and the -- the rhythm, you 
know, there was just -- it was theater like you -

- one -- it™s almost indescriba
ble of course, you -- you™ve seen it, everybody has seen it on film. 
But of course here I was actually seeing it, you kn
ow, and the colors are quite different when you 
are actually watching th
ese -- these -- these flags wave, you 
know, in the wind. And you™re there, 
and they™re -- and you -- you get the wind, the -- that 
the s -- that the flags ma de, that they were 
all -- all around, they were everywhere, and there were thousands of
 flags. It was just beautiful. 
And anyway, so I -- I screamed
 like everybody else, heil, heil, and I don™t know who he was -- I 
didn™t know who he was, but anyway -- 

Q: Did you have any idea what 
it was about, what it signified? 

A: No, I knew it was the German National -- you 
know, I knew he was the leader of Germany, 
and I knew that I had heard of course grown-ups, 
my mother -- my -- my mother™s friends. I had 
heard people say that he was a bad ma n, but of 
course I had no idea why he should be a bad ma n, 
it was so pretty. Why should he be bad, you know?  And -- and to me  it was just absolutely 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
5 
 
 
wonderful, as to everybody else there. So anyway
 then -- then there wa
s the interesting thing, 
which I have written about, I came to -- came to 
school in England. I had this wonderful teacher 
whom I adored, Lee Hindly. She died fairly recently. Lee Chadwick afterwards. We ll Lee 
Hindly, who I thought wa s a -- you know, fantasti
cally grown up lady, becau -- I think she was 
24, I mean -- and she was a very, very English, E
nglish girl -- young woman, 
with this wonderful 
voice, and this -- you know, this -- 
this absolutely beau
tiful -- not o -- Oxford English, but just 
the real sort of -- I-I can™t desc
ribe it, I mean, I just thought it 
was divine, and of course she 
taught me  every word I learned. I mean, I knew -- 
I didn™t know a word of English when I came  
there. And she was very, very kind, and I adored 
her. Anyway, I arrived back to school and -- 
and I wrote this -- we were supposed to write 
this, you know, this [indecipherable] this eg -- 
essay about our most beautiful day of the holiday
s. Well, naturally I wrot
e about this. And -- and 
she read it, and -- and having read
 all the others, a prize was give
n for a girl who wrote -- little 
girl who wrote about a stallion ha
ving -- I mean, not a stallion, 
a -- a -- a horse having a baby, I 
me  -- wonde rful, wonderful story. And -- and she 
-- she said to me , that™s a very good job of 
work, so that was enough for me . And then she sa
id, ﬁCan you stay here a mi nute afterwards? ﬂ  
After the lessons, so I did. And she said, ﬁI brought this for you, and I want you to read it.ﬂ And 

she gave me  this book, in English. And I said, ﬁWh
at is it?ﬂ It said Mein Ka mpf in German 
underneath, and said, you know, my 
battle. And I said, ﬁWhat is this? ﬂ  And she said, ﬁWell, the 
ma n you sa w speak wrote this book about his plans 
for Europe, and I want you to read it.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁWhy?ﬂ And she said, ﬁBecause anybody who co
mes from your corner of the world needs 
to read this book.ﬂ She -- I later found out, 
I didn™t know this, nobody knew this -- she was a 
me mber of the Communist party, and she became 
really very active indeed. In fact, you know 
later, much later, year
s later, she became  a 
councilor for the Communist party in Oldeburough, in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

Laseton where she lived, having ma rried twice, 
and so on. Anyway, she was -- she continued to 
be absolutely wonderful. And I read this book. I m
ean, I can™t say I read th
is book, but I read into 
this book. It was impossible for me  to 
read the whole book, you know. I wa -- 
Q: You were 11, right? 
A: I was -- yes, I was 11. I mean, I was -- I was 11
 and a half by then, because it was six months 
-- I™d been in this school for six months by th
en. And you know, I -- I did understand it. I mean, I 
would -- well, I would have said probably I read 
a third of it, you know, read here -- reading here 
and there, and there, and there, jumping, of
 course, which she knew I would. I mean it was 
impossible to read for -- for an 11 year old. But 
I -- I knew perfectly well that -- I saw perfectly 
well. I never understood how people told me  afterwards
 they -- well, they couldn™t read it to start 
out with, they hadn™t read it, which was a lie. Ev
erybody said they hadn™t r
ead it. All -- all ger -- 
I don™t think I -- well no, I did meet some Ger m
ans who admitted to having read it, but most 
Germans, including Speer, indeed, sa id they ha dn™t
 read it, that you know it was that Hitler wa -- 
ca -- in Speer™s case, Hitler told him it was -- it wa
s way over, it was -- it was too late, not to 
bother. I mean, so ma ny things had happened that 
it was -- we were holed, as they said. Anyway, 
so I brought it back to Lee, to 
Miss Hindly, and -- and she said, 
ﬁ Well what did you think of it? ﬂ  
And I said, ﬁWell, I da -- I -- two things. I mea
n, what I -- I mean, how is he go -- I mean, he 
wants to -- he wants Europe, he wants to rule 
over Europe, that seems qu
ite clear. But how can 
he do this,ﬂ I ask, ﬁwithout a war? ﬂ And she sa
id, ﬁ Well, I™m asking you, you tell me.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁ Well, I mean, other countries ar
en™t just going to give him th
eir country.ﬂ And she said, ﬁUh-
huh, mm-hm.ﬂ And I said, ﬁAnd what is he going 
on about the Jews?  I mean, he ke eps talking 
about the Jews, and he says awfully nasty things 
about them.ﬂ And she said, ﬁHe hates them.ﬂ So 
I said, ﬁBut  why? ﬂ And she sai
d, ﬁI don™t know. You will have to 
ma ke up your mi nd yourself in

the end. Learn it, read, and ma ybe you™ll find out.
ﬂ But of course I never did until, you know, 
until I did this work, which I did much later. Pr
obably this is where of my  -- my wish to do 
some thing started, without my knowing it, of 
course, you know. Anywa
y, that™s my childhood. 
Q: Now, you™ve written that you
r mo st influential and important 
years were your teens and 20™s. 
What was it like to grow up at a time  when the 
world™s being turned upside down in front of your 
own eyes? 

A: Well, I think actually I d -- I 
didn™t say that, I thi
nk of a -- ba -- I said some thing slightly 
different, my -- I think my most i mportant tim
e was -- the two mo me nt s, both when I worked 
with children. First during the wa
r, when I was in France, because the war came when I had been 
sent to study in France. And I stayed, I™d -- I 
fell in love with an 
English boy, and I was not 
going to go to -- my mot her had ma rried some body 
in Geneva, and had gone to live in Geneva, 
and I was damned if I was going to live in Geneva
. Sh -- they put me  into a pensionnat de jeune 
filles there, you know, and I ran 
away. I mean, it was just outrageous. Somebody who had been 
in the Reinhardt [indecipherable] you know -- you know
, to be then put into a pensionnat de 
jeune filles, I mean, you must imagine this, us
 walking in twos, you know?  I me an outrageous. 
Anyway, so I ran away. But they we
re quite sensible, and they left 
me  in -- in France, and they -- 
finally my -- my mother and stepfather -- and 
they very sweetly, you know, paid for me  to live 
with a family then, which was the most sensib
le thing. I mean, I was 15. So anyway -- I can™t 
reme mber what I said. Oh yes, well the war came, and I decided to work in a ca -- in a -- with an 
organization called the Auxiliaire Soc-Sociale, w
ho were taking care of -- well really, what we 

later called displaced 
persons, but that is not -- 
they were called refugees then -- came  into Paris 
from, you know, all the places that the Germans 
had already overrun. And I was put in charge by 

the -- the person who was a -- who was the pres
ident of this organization, a woma n called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
8 
 
 
Isabelle de la Bouillerie, who came  -- who was 
in my life for quite awhile afterwards. Anyway, 
Isabelle put me  in charge of the nursery. And 
we had a nursery for -- we
 -- we took -- didn™t took 
take away, but we -- we accepted, and the wome n w
ho came  with small babies were absolutely 
delighted, you know, after walking in the -- on th
e roads with small babies, they were all 
exhausted. I mean, that was the ma in thing that 
I think I -- I experienced for the first time, you 
know, the exhaustion of people who run away. It is
 just terrible. And if
 you ha -- if you are 
holding onto perhaps a small child and a baby, as ma
ny of them were, it -- it was killing. It was 
killing. They were -- they all arrived, you know
, filthy and pale, and oh, awful. And when we 
offered to take the babies and they could come  a
nd see the babies whenever they liked, of course. 
Some  of them were nursing the babies and they
 came quite often, but anyway, in the night I 
mean. We didn™t have a single ne
rve, not a single one. And we 
ended up at one point with 56 
babies in that room. And we had -- we had Am
erican me mber s of the Auxiliaire Sociale who 
were very rich, and it was absolutely extraordinar
y because first we started of course, with six 
babies, you know, and we had eight cots. And I said
 to one of the -- to this woma n, who -- this 
American who was part of the or
ganization, I said, ﬁYou know, I thi
nk there are going to be a lot 
more.ﬂ And she said, ﬁHow ma ny do you think ther
e mi ght be? ﬂ  ﬁI don™t know,ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t 
know, 10 - 20? ﬂ She said, ﬁRight.ﬂ And you know, it wa
s not two hours later th
at 20 cots arrived, 
and two nights later we had 56, and they came dur
ing the day, and we had 56 cots by that night. 
Q: How was  sh -- how was that organized? 

A: She bought them. She was a millionaire. I me an
 it™s wonderful when you™re very rich, you 
know, you just pa -- pick up the telephone. She 
picked up the telephone, she ordered 56 cots.  
Q: What was the extent of your dut
ies while you were doing this work? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
9 
 
 
A: Oh, this was really just 
taking care of babies, you know, c-
cleaning them, washing them, you 
know, feeding them, of course, 
if they were not on the brea
st. We ll, really hugging them, you 
know, cuddling them. They all need
ed a lot of cuddling. We  had a lot of baby clothes, again, 
from all these people who were very rich, who 
was in the Auxiliaire Sociale. So we had 
mountains of ma terial, so we were able to chan
ge them, and of course this ma de the mothers 
incredibly happy, suddenly to be ab
le to be without them for  a li
ttle while, know where they are, 
they were safe, they were being cleaned. And 
then they got them back looking absolutely 
gorgeous. It was very nice. 

Q: Where had these women come from? I mean, from -- 

A: We ll, they came from the north of France, 
which had already been overrun. And they came  
from -- they came from the borderlands, you 
know, on the -- on the east side, which hadn™t 
already been overrun. I mean it™s -- it was -- as
 you know, this was very quick. I me an, the 
Auxiliaire Sociale in Pari s only lasted fr om the 10
th
 of May -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- oh, sorry, from the fifth of May, I think to the 20
th
 of May. And by the 20
th
 of May, we 
knew that we were -- we were going to be left 
with any number of abandoned children, or lost 
children, or orphan childr en. And we set up agai
n, because all these people, you know, all these 
backers of the Auxiliaire Sociale, lucky they we
re very rich, and many of them had castles in 
various corners of -- of France and 
we  got a series of castles -- part
 of castles put at our disposal 
for them -- for starting children™s centers. And Itook 16 kids on -- I can™t reme mber the date, but 

it was the end of May, before the Germans ca me  i nto
 Paris, just before to
 -- to Villandry, which 
was one of the great châteaux of th
e Loire, and be longed to Isabelle 
de la Bouillerie, or rather her 
mother, who was American. Ann Crawford -- I can™
t reme mbe r  what her se -- second name  was. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
10 
 
 
Anyway, she had ma rried this Spaniard, who owned 
this wonderful castle. And they gave us the 
stables, and they had -- before we came  they 
had some  of the castle workers, you know, put beds, 
iron bedsteads and ma ttresses into 
-- and upstairs, they had actua
lly in the stables, I don™t know 
why. And this is where we had 
our children™s center. And actual
ly we ended up with I think 20 
or 21 children. So that was all right, it 
was -- it wa s a very -- you know, it was a -- it was 
certainly for me an incredible lesson when the 
Germans arrived, and I adore the French. I mean, I 
was so pro-French, for no reason. I mean, I had not
hing to fear with the Germans, and I had no 
reason to di slike the Germans, except what I 
had heard, all these el
egant people around my 
mother say -- some of them -- some of them of
 c ourse were Jews, because you know, most of the 
-- most of the theater people really were Jewis
h, and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot 
of newspaper friends, there were a lot of Jews
. And so I -- I certainly heard in ma  -- my  

subconscious I heard more things than in my cons
cious, but I had a real dislike for the Germans, 
which when they actually came into France, I co
uldn™t find a reason for. They were very nice 
when they came  to France. They were very ni ce 
to the French. They were absolutely charmi ng to 
me . You know, I had a -- a -- a -- I was introduc
ed by Isabelle, of course it was not beyond 
ma king use of whatever she could ma ke use of, so
 she introduced me with my father™s title, 

which of course didn™t gi ve me  anything at all,
 but she inve nted one. So -- because the -- in 

Hungary the daughter of a count ha
s no title. So -- but I very quick
ly became  countess, and they 
absolutely adored that, they loved this little
 Hungarian countess, you know, who spoke perfect 
German -- Viennese German at that, Volksdeuts
ch with a [indecipherable] art, you know, loved 

it -- if you understand that. 

Q: Yup. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
11 
 
 
A: Viennese Volksdeutsch. Anyway, so -- so I 
became her -- Isabelle™s interpreter, which was 
very useful for her, but extremely useful fo
r me, because I -- you know, I learned mor e, I think, 
from that than I could have learned any other wa
y. I mean, I spoke to so ma ny Ger mans, most of 
them as I say, very nice. As the year went
 on, and things began to happen, you know, people 
began to be locked up, including friends of mi ne in
 Paris, it was less nice
. And of course I was 
able to approach them on this, I mean ask them
 why, you know. And of cour
se, a lot of Jews in 
Paris were arrest ed, which Isabe
lle learned about very
 quickly, as she had a very wide circle. 
And -- and I -- I -- I challenged 
them on that. And you know, most 
of them really didn™t know. 
They didn™t know. Of course, most of the peopl
e we saw were army officers, you know, they 
were -- those were the people who came  to see th
e chateaux. I mean, you weren™t going to have 
the privates come  and see chateaux, on the whol
e. So the army officers, most of them 
professional army officers, they
 didn™t know. They said, ﬁWell,
 you know, it™s the law, it™s the 
law.ﬂ And I -- I would ask, ﬁ Why is it the law?
ﬂ I had great argument 
with two people who -- 
and this is the terrible th
ing, it™s a terrible -- I™ll 
never forget that, I -- I 
mean, I™m partly to blame 
for what happened, I think. Isabelle became very friendly with a German doctor, and a -- I wrot e 

about that, the -- so you know about
 it already, a da -- da -- a school
 -- former school director. 
And they came all the time. I mea
n, they came -- I think they must have come  three times a week 
at least, to have tea with her, 
to have lunch with her, to have 
dinner even with her, you know, and 
she always called me in whenever I could get 
away from the children, 
and we both -- she very 
elegantly, and me  not elegantly at
 all, would challenge them on 
all these things. Her secretary, 
who she had with her, wa s Jewish, Jacqueline, 
I can™t reme mber her other name , and s he was 
very protective of -- of certainly of Jacqueline, a
nd I think of -- or we -- two of our Auxiliaire 
nurses -- well, yeah, but they weren™t nurses, th
ey were like me, I mean we  were volunteers, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
12 
 
 
a mother and daughter, very good looking, were bot
h Jew -- well, obviously both, but they were 
Jewish. So she was very protective of them, a
nd these two people just took it, you know. And 
they -- I would ask and ask and ask, and they woul
d say there is no explana
tion, it is the law, and 
most people agree with it, and blah, blah, blah, 
and blah, blah, blah. Anyway, this went on and 
on, and one day they disappeared.  

Q: The two German offi cers?  

A: Mm-hm. And I had made another friend, who in
 fact saved me  in the end, who was the head 
of intelligence, military intelligen
ce , in Tours, which was the neares
t city. And I went to see him, 
and I said, ﬁThese were our fr
iends, what™s happened -- well, 
these are our friends, where are 
they? ﬂ  And he said, ﬁI don™t wa
nt you ever to ask about them
 again.ﬂ And I said, ﬁNo, but you 
have to tell us what happened, if you know wha t
 happened. Where are they?ﬂ And he said, ﬁI™m 
afraid they were arrested.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁBut why?ﬂ And he said, ﬁB
ecause they saw too much of you 
French.ﬂ And I don -- then later,
 you know, also through him,  found out that the doctor was sent 
to the Russian -- to the Russian front, and he was k
illed very soon. He was the -- sent as a me dic, 

but he was killed very soon. And 
-- and the school director was se
nt to a concentration camp, he 
was fat. You know, he was -- he -- i-impossible fo
r him to do anything in a concentration camp, 

he couldn™t have. And he died, t
oo. So you know we -- we really -- I 
me an this is some thing we -
- we -- we really made their liv
es, I think, very unhappy these last
 weeks they had, which is quite 
awful. Anyway, there you are. That™s how, you know
, how it went there. Anyway, by this time , I 
was doing little things, very small things, nothing 
of note, nothing heroic fo
r -- for the resist ance. 
B -- it was just starting, you know, the 
resistance really, in 1941 bare
ly existed, barely. It existed 
in places like Paris, and Lyon, but in the country
side of course, there was no resistance, I me an 
good God. So what we did, the only things we did was on two occasions we  ma naged to -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

ma naged to take care of some  British fliers who --  who crashed, and who happened to crash --  
one of them actually crashed in the park, which 
was extremely convenient, yes. But the other one 
crashed, and some how made his 
way to us, so we hid these two. And we hid them by putting 
them in the children™s dormitory. The children ju
st loved it. The two oldest boys gave up their 
beds. I mean, one on one occasion, and the othe
r on the other occasion. And these bo -- these 
boys, you know, these young RAF boys, I mean, they 
were -- they were 18 - 19. I me an, they 
were children. And they -- our children were so
 excited. You know, now they were part of it. 
Anyway, however -- 

Q: I™ve got to just turn -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an in
terview with Gitta Sereny. For every [indecipherable] 

in England – i-if I remember rightly, you we
re fourteen in March 1938, when the Nazis 
ma rched into Vienna -- 

A: No, I 15. 

Q: Were you 15? 

A: I was 15, yes. 

Q: What do you recollect about 
that happening, about the atmos
phere, the general reaction, and 
your own reaction to all that? 

A: We ll, you know, that was the -- the odd thing, becau
se this is the first time, of course, I saw 
them again since 1934. So I was not -- you know, I wa
s not as concerned as, of course, some  of 
my mother™s friends were, and my mother. My
 mother ha -- was very concerned. She had 
become  engaged to a famous economist called L
udwig von Mises, who was Jewish, and -- but a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
14 
 
 
very, very eminent ma n, and who is -- who had 
been already, for four 
years at the Ecole de 
Zoadsetude in Geneva, so he was not there. I 
mean, they would -- he would come  back every 
summer to go mountain climbing with her, that was 
their thing, and they we
re -- they were real, 
real country nuts, real 
mountain nuts. I hardly kn
ew him. I mean, he was 
-- he didn™t come  close 
to me  at all, there was -- very severe ma n, I 
thought. I couldn™t -- I could not understand how she 
could be in love with him, but there you are, 
there you are. And so -- so this was a worry of 
course, that she -- that she was 
very concerned, she was very worri
ed about all of it. And -- and 
then of course, you know, it began, I mean you -- 
you -- you -- there were an awf -- as I told you, 
there were an awful lot of -- of Jews in the theater world, and I was at the Reinhardt semi nar 
which was -- well, I mean, Reinhardt of course wa
s a Jew. He was not there, I mean he had left 
in -- he was in Vienna last -- I 
can™t reme mber, but I th
ink it was in January of that year. He had 
done a wonderful production at his th
eater, which we all, of course, 
went to the rehearsals, and it 
was just absolutely wonderful. But then he left, 
and with him his -- his wife, Helene Thimig, who 
was -- you know, for whom we all -- I mean, we 
just adored her, I mean she was the most 
wonderful actress. I mean, probabl
y there were two great, great ac
tresses in Austria. There was 
she, and Paula We ssely, two really great actress,
 and of course we, as very young people, we -- 
we just had adorations for these people, you kno
w. Anyway, she left. That was a blow because 
we -- we did find out that she left because Rei
nhardt was a Jew, and he thought that the Germans 

were comi ng in. And he was damn r i ght. He tho
ught that the Austrians would not be able to 
withstand it, and he thought they
 were -- this I found out muc h later, but I mean, this is what 
happened. So, you know, I was a little bit pr econditione d against them by this time , all this. And 

then they came  in, and it was really quite stra
nge, because you know, Vienna didn™t suit them, or 
they didn™t suit Vienna. I mean, they -- they were
 -- they were incredibly different. I me an, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
15 
 
 
Viennese are -- I mean, I don™t necessarily like the Vi
ennese all that much, but they -- the -- the -
- they are a very special breed, a
nd it™s not a German breed. It just
 isn™t. You know, it -- it -- it -- 
it dates back to the empire, the 
-- this extraordinary mi xture, 
if you take a Viennese telephone 
book -- I don™t know whether you™ve ever done th
is, you take a Viennese telephone book, and 
you will see all the names in th
e world, I mean Polish, Czech, it™
s all from eastern Europe, 
Hungarian. And you will hardly see German na mes. 
You know, and this -- this speaks -- this -- 
this says some thing, you know, and so when th
ese Germans came in, all just like in 1934, 
looking wonderful, clean, you know, beautiful. They 
were beautiful me n, but they didn™t fit. 
They didn™t fit. And then, within
 two days we had really, at th
e semi nar we had a real shock, 
because the semi nar -- all the schools re
opened, the university and -- and the -- 
Q: Within two days? 

A: Within two days, yes, on the 15
th
 they reopened. And so we went to school and the first thing 
we saw was the admi nistrator who Re inhardt had 
put in, Dr. Neidafuhr, wearing a swastika. And 
this was absolutely extraordinary. Now this is wh
en -- no, it was not then, 
it was a little bit later, 
I realized some thing that had happe
ned, which I had not really sort of
 ful -- fully taken in the real 
reason for. We were -- we we
re preparing, or we  did -- you know, we had these student 
performa nces of course. 

Q: [coughing] Forgive me . Do go on, so sorry. 

A: No, that™s all right. Well anyw
ay, a couple of months before we had prepared this -- this is -- 
not a couple mo -- it was in -- before Christma
s, before Christma s ™37, we were preparing 
Gorky™s, ﬁThe Buffoon,ﬂ I don™t know whether 
you know that play. And a -- there we re these 
two wome n™s parts, Natasha and 
Natalia, I think. And I played 
one of them, and we had two 
casts, who would play alternative 
-- you know, alternately, for a week. And I was in the first cast. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
16 
 
 
And th-the play was being -- there -- there™s a 
story, there™s -- the pl
ay was being produced -- 
directed by of course a student, but under the su
pervision of a ma n called Geyer, G-e-y-e-r, who 
was the mos t  charmi ng ma n. He wa s the -- he was 
the director of a big theater in Vienna called 
the Volkes theater, and he was one of our teach
ers. I mean, they were all people like that, you 
see?  And -- and he was charmi ng. He was incapab
le of ever telling anyone that he was no good. 
So everybody adored him, you know. And he ha
d given these parts, he had you know, assigned 
these parts to the people he wanted. And the girl
 who had my  part in 
the second cast, I thought 
was very good, you know?  And suddenly it was take
n away from her. And there was sort of 
gossip going on that Neidafuhr had taken it away fr
om her, and she was absolutely in despair. 

And it is only much later that I found out th
at she was Jewish, because you know, really nobody 
-- this is some thing that peopl
e find very difficult to understa
nd, but really we didn™t know who 
was Jewish. There were -- I thi
nk there were six Jewish students,
 I afterwards of course, found 
out. In -- in the -- in the tw
o year -- in the two year -- 
Q: Course. 

A: Yeah, the courses last two years. 

Q: Mm. 

A: So there were -- I don™t know there were -- 
all together I think there were 70 students. And 
there were six Jewish students, and she was one 
of them, which we found out, of course, when 
all this happened, when the nat -- when the Nazis came in, cause they di sa ppeared very quickly. I 

mean, it™s not that they were arre
sted or anything, but they were 
taken out of the school, or they 
were expelled. Then I realized 
that she had been taken -- that 
he had taken -- when I saw hi m 
with the swastika, I discussed it 
with some  friends, and we decided, having then -- by then found 
out that she was Jewish, that he had take
n it away from her because she wa s Jewish. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
17 
 
 
Q: But nothing was said? 
A: No, nothing was said. I mean, what could you 
say?  Wo -- how can you attack as a -- as a 
student, how can -- you -- we were all very
 young, and you know, we™re not -- we were not 
educated in this -- in this ci
vic response thing, which -- you know
, which one gained with time. I 
mean, which then I gained of course in the 
-- and -- and exercised on these poor two Germans 
who we became friends with, you know. But that -- b
ack home in ™38 -- I me an in Aus t ria, we 
had -- there was less civic cons
cience around than -- than you can possibly imagine. I mean, 
good God, they de -- they haven™t had any civic conscience until 1986 when Wa ldheim -- when 

the Wa ldheim story arose, then civic conscience at
 last  became a reality in Austria, and now, it™s 

different. But it™s taken a long time, hasn™t it?  An
yway, in ™38 -- listen, the long and short of it is 

that the Viennese were absolutely de light ed by th
e arrival of the na -- of the Germans. And of 

course, it was not only the -- the 
Viennese, I mean the Austrians were delighted, and one has to 
see this unemotionally as one can. Austria was a 
country that was economi
cally unviable. It only 
existed in tourism. There was no other way for 
Austria to exist. And 
since -- I mean, now of 
course I found out so much more, you know, I know
 so muc h more now than I did, I didn™t know 
any of this of course, because I was -- I had ab
solutely nothing to do w
ith politics, but I know 
now, I mean that -- that the social democrats, can
 you believe it, were the 
first, who in the early 
20™s wanted an annexi -- an -- 
an annexation to Germany. You se
e?  Without -- I me an, at that 
time of course, they were not the Nazis, but they
 were -- this -- this anschl uss to Germany was 
the thing that had gone through the 20
th
 century, the early 20
th
 century, and the more people 
realized, after the empire died, that the only wa
y that Germany -- that Austria could survive was 
as part of Germany. The  more people, you know, fe
lt this, and this was not -- really not because 
they were -- I mean, in America you see mostly, 
but also elsewhere, this became a -- well, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
18 
 
 
became thought of as everything st emmi ng from a n
ti-Semitism, and this isn™t true, never was 
true. Of course the -- all -- a -- Austria, 
you know, was -- was -- was -- behaved absolutely 
atrociously about it™s Jews. I mean, really atro
ciously, worse than the Germans. But it -- it was 
not really -- that was not the 
reasons why they wanted the Germans, it was economic. And the 
ideological part was very small. Very powerfu
l, but very small. Very powerful, alas. And 
becomi ng more powerful all the time. As the Germ
ans ca me  i n, things became  much better very 
quickly. And for the first year they were there 
-- and I was not there then any more because my 
mother really had to leave, you know, with being 
this -- this ma rriage well known -- I mean, this 
about to be ma rried to Louie -- to Lou. So we -- we
 left at the end of May, so I was only there for 
two months, in Nazi -- occupied
 Nazi -- not occupied, Nazi Vi e
nna, really. It was -- it wasn™t 
occupied, I mean, it was not a victim, they were not
 victims. Really not. I mean, they wanted the 
Germans.  

Q: You™ve written that you were st
ruck very early on by the Nazi™s 
behavior to the Jews, and this 
-- 

A: Yes, we did see that, as I --
 I™ve written this, though, and you know 
it, and it™s all -- it™s all -- 
Q: We ll, I know it, but there™s 
one -- one anecdote that I find ve
ry striking, I think you were 
comi ng with your friend Elfie from s c hool, and 
you noticed a group of people, including your 

pediatrician. Can you -- can you 
describe that anecdote? 
A: Well yes, that was --  that was -- that was the on
e I wrote in fact, the -- it™s -- that was really 
shocking. I mean, we were walki
ng -- it was actually not comi ng 
from s c hool, we were going for 
a walk, and I think, I honestly think it was a Sa
turday, but I™m not sure, because w-we would 
have been in school. Or ma ybe it was the 14
th
, no I think it was on the 14
th
, it™s before the school 
reopened. That™s it, of course. A
nd he -- she and I went for a walk
 through the innerashtatsa --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
19 
 
 
through the inner city, you know whe r e -- which is wh
ere I lived. She didn™t, in fact, she lived in 
the fourth district, but she came a
nd w-we -- we were always togeth
er, so we went for this walk. 
And we were walking along the Graben, which is 
a beautiful, beautiful 
street, right -- you know, 
it™s right in the center, it was 
two mi nutes from where I lived. A
nd -- and we saw this -- this -- 
this group of laughing people, and there were 
two -- two Germans -- I mean, or maybe they 
weren™t, ma ybe they were Austrians, but they
 were in uniform, black unifor ms with, you know, 
swastika arm bands. And we ma de our way throu
gh this crowd, there were probably about 50 - 
60 people, a lot of people. 
Q: Mm. 

A: So we couldn™t see anything from -- from out
side that circle, but 
we ma de our way through, 
and -- and there we saw these -- this
 -- this group of -- of elder -- re
ally elderly -- well, elderly, I 
mean they were not young, ladies and gentleme n, because that™s what they all were. You know, 

you could see it, I mean it was -- you 
could see it in their clothes, you 
could see it in their faces, I 
mean it was not -- it was not -- it was not criminal
s, that™s what I™m trying to say, they were 
ladies and gentleme n. And they were brushing 
-- they were cleaning the paveme nt with 
toothbrushes. And I recognized 
Dr. Berggrün who was my pediat
rician -- who had been my 
pediatrician. And I loved him when I was a sma
ll girl. He was -- and he saved my life, as a 
ma tter of fac t , when I had diphthe
ria. Anyway -- and he was one of them, and his wife, whom I 
didn™t know, but I ne -- finally f
ound out, of course, that she was hi
s wife, was with him, and she 
was doing this. And -- 

Q: On hands and knees, and -- 

A: Oh yes, absolutely, on their knees. And -- 
and we went -- and they
 had a couple of, you know, 
buckets where they dunk the -- soapy buckets wh
ere they dunk the toothbrush in. Anyway, so I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
20 
 
 
went up to one of these Nazis and said, ﬁAre 
you ma d?  Are you completely ma d?  Wh at are you 
doing there?ﬂ I said, ﬁDid -- did 
you realize that one of these 
me n -- I mean, I don™t know who 
the others are, but one of these me n is a savior
 of lives? He saved my life when I was a baby.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁWhat are you, a Jew?ﬂ And I said, ﬁNo, but what does th
at got to do with it?ﬂ And -- 
but Elfie was much more effective than I, because I was rather dumpy little gi rl. I me an, I was 
not ugly, but I was dumpy, you know. I was not a beau
ty at all. She was a raving beauty. She was 
a dancer you know, she has a wonderful little body, and -- and 
she was am -- actually a few 
months younger than I, I think she 
was still 14. And she had this -- 
this thing, this black -- sorry, 
this black hair, but you know all silk. I mean, it 
was the most beautiful thing you can imagine, I 
mean she -- she really was su -- I me an, people w
ould turn around in the street when we walked 
along the street, I mean, she was so incredible
. And she had a wonderful voice, and then she 
became an operetta star. But never mind. She we
n -- she was go -- we were both going up to 
these -- to these characters. A
nd she said, ﬁIs that what you call 
our liberation? ﬂ And she sang it 
out, you know, and it -- it we -- I thin
k the whole street must have 
heard it, in this wonderful -- 
she had this wonderful voice, a
nd she had -- really she was working extremely hard at the 
semi nar on her voice, because she ha d this beautifu
l singing voice, too. And so they -- they really 
-- they -- she -- they al
l knew she was going to be a star. I 
mean, there was just no doubt, she was 
so beautiful, you know, and talented, I mean she was talented. She was not a great dr-drama tic 

talent, but oh, wonderful personality. And do 
you know, it was really th
e most extraordinary 
thing that you can imagine. All these peopl
e who™ve been around there laughing, you know, and 

-- and -- was disgusting, it was a 
disgusting sight, they all me lted 
away. I don™t think it took more 
than five seconds and they were gone. And then these two characters disappeared, and then there 

were only these people, all st
ill on their knees. I don™t know how
 ma ny there were, you know, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
21 
 
 
didn™t count them. And t hen slowly they got up 
and they disappeared. And then prof -- Dr. 
Berggrün, he was a professor as a matter of fact, 
Dr. Berggrün came up to us, with his wife, he -- 
which I now realize that was his wife, little 
woma n, little round woma
n. Oh, her face, you know, 
was just so exhausted, and so frightened. And he 
said in a very severe 
voice, ﬁYou must never do 
this again, never. It is very dangerous for you.ﬂ A
nd then I found out they killed him,  later. They 
killed him in Sobibor in ™43. And her, no 
doubt, I mean I -- you know, I only found this out 
much later, but that was absolutely terrible, a
nd of course it stayed w
ith us. Elfie too. You know, 
Elfie, too, I mean I left and then
 I -- but Elfie and I rema ined 
in correspondence for a long time, 
until she really didn™t dare to write any more. 
But she --  she really loathed them. She loathed 
them also partly because she found out that her fath
er had be en an illegal Nazi, and -- and he had 
told her, the day before this happened, on the 13
th
 of March, my birthday, he
 had told her that -- 
or was it even on the 12
th
, at dinnertime, he said that she wa
s never to talk to any Jew again, and 
that all these s-sou --  Sauj uden they called them, 
they would all be taken care of, or whatever, 
you know, eliminated. And she told me  this. She wa
s in despair. She was really in despair, 
because we loved all these teachers, you see. They
 were very important to us, I mean they were 
our lives. They were very important people in Vi
enna, but it was not beca
use of that we loved 
them. They were -- even those -- I mean there 
was one who was actu -- actu
ally really disliked 
by everybody except me . It™s rea
lly true, I was the only person who liked him. He was the 
director of Reinhardt™s theater, 
his name  was Ans l otter, and he
 was a fine novelist. He wrote 
really wonderful novels, which I had read all his 
novels, so I liked him already for that. And then 
for some  or other reason he liked me , I don™t kno
w why, but he did, because I really was not a -- 
I was not a -- well, I mean there were very tale
nted people at the -- you know f-for -- for acting at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
22 
 
 
the -- at the school, and I was not 
one of the mos t  talented ones. 
I was not without talent, but I 
was not -- you know, I would never 
have been a great actress.  
Q: Mm. 
A: I would have been useful. But he liked me , 
and he put me  into one of the other of his 
productions. Three productions he put me  in. In one
 of them a lead. I think I was pretty bad, but 
never mi nd. Sa -- it was a -- is a play which 
you probably don™t know, it was -- it™s called in 
German, ﬁGeshwista siblings,ﬂ by Ge rta. 

Q: Yeah, I got it. 

A: And I was the sister, God. A very difficult play
 [indecipherable]. Course
 I didn™t understand, I 
mean I was much too young for the semi na
r. We ll, never mi nd. [indecipherable] 
Q: Do you want a breather now?  Do you want a little rest? 

A: Do you want a little tea? 

Q: Oh, sure. 
A: Absolute -- 
Q: Go straight – So, after spending part of th
e wa r in the U.S., you returned to Europe a few 
months before the end 
of the war, I think. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Tell me -- 

A: I returned with UNRRA. 

Q: You returned with UNRRA. Tell me  what you 
did with them, and where you were, and so on. 
A: Well, I returned for the pur
pose of serving in displaced person™s camps. They needed people 
with languages, and of course they needed to 
-- they were very keen to have some body who 

already had experience with childr
en -- with children such as th
e children I had taken care of in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
23 
 
 
France. And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged 
as a -- as an assistant,
 because I was young, an 
assistant child welfare officer. I then became a 
-- you know, I was promot ed, but I went there in a 
rather junior position, and I™m trying to think wh
ere my first assignment was. Yes, my first 
assignment -- well, I was first, as a ma tter of fact, my very first assignment was in Dachau, 
which was quite a shock because I™d
 -- I di dn™t realize that that 
would be my first assignme nt. 
We  were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- 
a city called Karlsruhe, wh
ich was the -- the western 
allied headquarters for UNRRA. And a huge, huge so
rt of -- oh, it was this
 -- you know, for mer I 
don™t know what it was, but hundreds of barracks 
and things, and -- and that™s where we all 
stayed for awhile, had various lessons in this 
and that, and orientation, and then were assigned 
from there. And to my great su
rprise, I was called in and I wa s 
told that I was going to Dachau. 
And I said, ﬁBut there are no ch
ildren in Dachau.ﬂ And the -- th
e woma n who was talking to me , 
she said, ﬁI™m afraid you™re going to have a rath
er shocking surprise.ﬂ Which I did. I really did 
have a shocking surprise , because there were a lo
t of children. Of course, Dachau was not -- you 
know, Dachau is much mi sunderstood in the -- in 
the literature, and by historians. Dachau, as 
you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn™t be addr
essing you, but anyway, Dachau was the first 
concentration camp the Nazis opened, and it was 
purely a political camp. It was for -- it was 
intended for German political  prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually 

became, in fact, the kapos. It was not intended for 
Jews at all. And later it was represented as an 
extermination camp, which it never was. I have ju
st read a -- a completely new book, which in 
fact has not yet been published, bu
t is about to be published in 
three weeks in America, and it 
still has this presentation of it, which is really a 
great shame. This is particul arly in America that 
they mi srepresented. It is as 
if it™s a need, always to asso
ciate, you know, the Nazis with the 
crime against the Je ws. Now, of course, all of
 us who write, up to a point, have to do this, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
24 
 
 
because it wa s the worst thing they did, and you ca
nnot not do it. But if you do that exclusively, 
then you are mi srepresenting histor
y. And you™re mi srepresenting what
 Hitler was, what his plan 
was, what the whole thing was, and why the 
danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole 
of Europe, or the world. I mean, the death of th
e Jews was the worst th
ing, of course, and the 
factory killings, and -- but it was 
-- basically it wa s a part of a 
huge geopolitical program which 
really the -- most of the world doe
sn™t know because it has so focused on that one part of it. And 
it™s understandable, I mean, emotion is understand
able, but historically it™s wrong. Anyway, so 
when I came to Dachau, there was -- there were 
all these kids. And ther
e were two groups of 
kids, which is also extremely in
teresting. There were the child 
-- there were no Jewish children, 
virtually no Jewish children. Ma
ybe one or two some where, but
 this was not -- you know, the 
Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or
 two, there were -- there were a few, but it was 
-- there -- that was the easiest.
 They brought in -- UNRRA ha d 
a -- had a special issue, like a 
special division for taking care of
 -- of Jews who survived the N
azis, and they very sensibly 
assigned to this, or ma de responsible for this 
division, Jewish UNRRA of
ficials. I mean, it was 
the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can 
deal with it better, and they 
could -- and they would be accepted much better by 
these vi ctims. And so this is what happened. 
So in Dachau too, within da -- I mean, I came ther
e very soon after it was -- after the Americans 
arrived. I mean, really within days. And within 
-- again within days, some of UNRRA officers 
arrived, who took away the Jewish children. 
That was -- you know, that was wonderfully 
organized. So I was left with another -- with 
another UNRRA. I think she was -- I think she was 
a higher rank than I. But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became  -- had become  
friends. And we put in -- were in charge of th
ese children. And you have --
 these were all on the 
one hand, children whose parents had been brought 
into -- into Germany as forced laborers. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
25 
 
 
they were mostly Polish and Russian children. 
They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and 
Russian, and a few words of Ger man here and ther
e. Some  Czech children, but mostly, as I say, 
it was eastern European children, 
who had either been brought in
 by themselves, or they had 
been brought in after their parents had been takenin with them. Because in quite ma ny -- in quite 
a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from eastern Europe to work in Germany, letting them 

take their smaller children. In quite a few cases, 
not -- not -- not -- not -- 
it was not a rarity. So 
we were landed with quite a few quite young ch
ildren, who couldn™t speak [indecipherable] the 
girl who was -- sorry, the girl w
ho was with me  was of Polish descent, an American of Polish 
descent. She spoke Polish, which was a great hel
p. Anyway, so that was one group, and the other 
group were German children. And th
ey were the children of the 20
th
 of July German officers, 
who had been in the assassination plan against Hi
tler. This was an extraordinary thing, because 
here you had these German children, who had gone
 to elite schools, you know, who were very, 
very German children.  
Q: Mm. 
A: They were all absolutely beautiful, almost -- 
almost all of them. And they were living with 
children who they had been taught to despise, fro
m countries they had been taught to hate. And 
they were really very dependent on these chil
dren, because you know, where the children were 
older, they were put in charge
 of the groups, I mean, they had 
group leaders and so on. And they 
had no German group leaders. Of course not. 
Can you imagine the Americans allowing German 
group leaders?  No sir, not even amongst children.

Beginning of Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial
 Museum interview with Gitta Sereny, conducted 
by Vera Frankel on February 28
th
, 2004, in London. This is tape number two, side A.  
A: So in fact it became  very soon one of my 
great problems because, I mean, I was only there for 
two and a half weeks, but I was told from th
e beginning that I had no responsibility for the 
German children. We ll this, of course, was ridi
culous. I mean, to me  it was ridiculous. You 
couldn™t -- I mean, this was a terr
ible place, because while it had b
een intended for -- as I told wa 
-- told you before, what -- what -- what it wa
s intended for by the Germans originally, but over 
the last -- over the last six mont
hs of the war, as the war turned against the Germans, t hey walked 
people from the eastern camps, including Auschwitz
 and so on, they walked them all the way 
down to -- to -- to southern Germany. And this
 camp, Dachau, which was meant for -- I cannot 
reme mber really how ma ny, but certainly not more
 than five to eight thousand, and when I came 
there, there were 30,000. So I mean, it was just 
absolutely appalling, and impossible for the 
inma tes, you know, to keep it clean. I mean, you ca 
-- if you -- i -- i -- one 
has to imagine, for 
instance, the hygienic possibilities,
 which really were perfectly al
l right, I™m sure, when they 
started this thing. Cause they were very hot 
on hygien -- hygienic ma tte
rs, the Germans, and -- 
and you know the -- one could see -- I could see ho
 -- what there was originally. I me a n, there 
were enough loos, certainly, for 
5,000 prisoners, and cer
tainly enough ablution, as they called it. 
It was just sort of -- oh, well it was taps, with water. 

Q: Right. 

A: But you know, with the -- lots of them. And 
c e rtainly enough for five thousand people to 
wash, but not 30,000. It was impossible. And it was impo
ssible to keep the loos
 ti -- clean. It was 
absolutely impossible, particularly as most of th
em had diarrhea, and all kinds of nasty things. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
27 
 
 
it was a terrible place when we got there, really
 terrible. And there wasn™t very much we could 
do except what really our job was, 
which was to get the children out.  
Q: Sure. 
A: Our job, our -- this wa s our -- we were commi
ssioned to do this, to get the children out, into 
UNRRA installations, which were being -- were 
just being opened. I mean, it was completely 
new, you see. But w-w-we did, we -- we got, in th
ese two and a half weeks, which were all we 
were allowed, we -- we did get, probably about
 a thousand children out. And we couldn™t get the 
German children out. We were told this was the business of the German Red Cross, and it was -- 

well, I had terrible fights with the Americans about
 this, because it was the German Red Cross, 
but they wouldn™t allow the German Red Cross in
to Dachau. This was the sort of thing that 
happened there, and so it wa
s a -- you know, it was a -- a -- a 
total impossibility, the little 
German children could not be taken care of. So of
 course we took care of them. I mean, of course 
we did, against -- you know, against -- but we co
uldn™t get them out. That was imposs i ble. So 
when we left, having transporte
d, or having arranged for tran
sport for these about thousand 
children, w-we saw behind us these German ch
ildren. There weren™t that many, I mea n, there 
were probably about a hundred. A hundred is
 a hundred, you know. An
d there was no food. 
Q: The children you got out, where 
were they destined to go? 
A: Well their -- they were -- that was -- I mean, 
we did organize that, of course. I me an, by that 
time they had -- there had been emergency -- th
e Americans were very 
good about that, they 
helped UNRRA to set up emergency camps, and th
ere were four, I think, by that time, four 
children™s camps which had been set up with American troops partly in charge, and partly 

UNRRA officials who -- for whom t his was a completely new job. I me a n, all of them, but -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
28 
 
 
have come  from London, or -- or Wa shington, as I di
d, totally inexperienced 
in all this, most of 
them. 
Q: How shocking was it for you to see what awaite
d you there?  Wh -- I me an, what did -- what -- 
what do you imagine when [indecipherable] 

A: The UNRRA -- once we got into the UNRRA 
camps, you know, it was -- I mean, I got in my 

-- my first camp was in -- in -- in a pl ace called V
ilshofen, which is a little 
village. I was trying to 
think a -- near -- well, I can™t
 -- nobody would know it anyway. 
But it was not far from the 
Austrian border at Passau. And -- and a very pret
ty village. And we -- it wa s rather terrible what 
we did, but we had to do it, of course. We  had 
to requisition housing to create this camp. And we  
empt -- they had -- there were f
our or five, sort of what we 
would call here in England council 
housing, but very pretty council housing, you know? 

Q: So kind of subsidized housing -- 

A: Or subsidized housing, but -- but the Germans di
d this sort of thing -- 
the Nazis did this sort 
of thing very, very well. I mean, they were all 
rather pretty flats, w
ith all the conveniences you 
can possibly think of. And we threw out about 4,
000 people, and took their flats. And of course 
they loathed us, as you can imagine. But that is 
where -- well of cour -- I ha -- didn™t have the 
thousand children, you know, I had about a hundred 
of these thousand children. And so I -- I was 
in charge of these hundred kids. No, this was 
not a shock, you know. I very quickly found Polish 
DPs, Polish false laborers, and -- who came because they heard the camp was there, and w -- had 

been established -- or was being established. They
 were extraordinarily good. I mean, they were -
- you know, there were also some  for mer officers, 
I mean. It was very quickly -- I felt th -- as I 
reme mber it, it was quite extraordinary, how within
 one week we had set up a whole hierarchy of 
-- of helpers who could speak, of course, to the 
children, to st art out with. Who were teachers, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
29 
 
 
had been teachers in their lives. Had -- there we
re two doctors, you know, we
 had all -- we had -- 
we had several who had been professional officers. 
In fact one of them became the head of the -- 
of the DP camp, in the end. I mean, the -- the 
DP head -- there was always a DP hierarchy. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You established that, and you we
re above it, but I mean, basica
lly you weren™t. I mean, they 
did it. 

Q: Right. 

A: You just were there to -- to help th
em with any, really, 
bureaucratic problem. 
Q: Mm. 

A: I also did do some  -- you know, some  welfare wo
rk, because I had -- I™d -- I™d trained to do 
this, you know, and -- and of cour
se I loved doing it, particular
ly with the children, I mean 
children -- there were problems with the children
, as you can imagine, I mean they were -- they 
were -- they were alone, they -- they didn™t know 
where their parents were
, they -- I mean, they 
were homesick, they were th -- million things. Bu
t no, I was not shocked, it was -- it was a -- this 
is really what I meant in -- I wrote in one of 
my books that -- that ce
rtainly what happened in 
UNRRA, and what I saw and learned 
there, was the most valuable e
xperience of my life. I think 
it di -- it -- it -- I think it orientat
ed, if you like, everything that I 
have done since. I mean that -- 
all my thinking, and -- so it™s 
-- it™s extraordinary what you 
learn when you are -- you know, 
when you are close for two years to -- to peop
le with appalling problems. Then you -- you -- 
well, above all, of course, you realize that what
ever your private little problems are, they™re 
nothing. They™re nothing. You are extraordinarily
 lucky. You know, you have -- y-you have -- I, 
in fact, had -- had no root s, because  I had no home really. But I never mi nded, because I always 

saw myself as a European. So it -- it meant -- ma de
 absolutely no difference, I -- I didn™t -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
30 
 
 
wasn™t -- I -- I didn™t mi ss anywhere. I di-didn™
t miss Vienna, though I loved it, but I didn™t mi ss 
it. If -- if I missed anything, probably, aside fr
om my adoration for France, I mi ssed England 
most, where I had three very happy years in sc
hool. You know, I really loved it. And -- and 

really I was extremely happy when I -- when I me
t my husband and he -- years later in France, 
and he was a ﬁVogueﬂ photographer, and -- and 
he was sent to London -- we were sent to 
London, and he fell in love with London, and that
 was a very happy thing for me , because there 
we were, two of us, in love with England. So that was good. 

Q: Now, unless I™m mi staken, you™ve said 
your most difficult UNRRA posting was to 
Regensburg, in -- in ™56? 

A: We ll, yes. Regensburg was very 
difficult because it was a huge camp.  
Q: 20,000? 

A: 20,000 Ukrainians. And you really have to be 
with 20,000 Ukrainians to understand what that 
is. I mean, it™s -- it -- they are 
-- they are the most stubborn peopl
e, and I don™t want to call -- 
that™s always stupid, I want to 
-- don™t want to generalize and sa
y they were self-serving, but 
certainly thei r --  the he -- th
e people who headed that, completely different from my Poles in 
Vilshofen, and the next place wher
e I was, I also had a Polish cam
p. Th -- wh -- who -- who were 
totally unself- serving. 

Q: Mm. 

A: Now, the Ukrainians were th -- j-ju-just -- 
and they -- they didn™t -- 
the -- the heads of -- of 
that 20,000, you know, group, they did not care who knew 
it, they were the heads of it, and never 
mi nd the foot soldiers. So it -- it -- it -- it really
 wa s a -- a difficult thing, and to think that these 
people came -- you know, ca me  out of a Communist 
-- basically out of a 
Communist, if you like, 
childhood and past. Maybe it was the r
eaction to it, because it seemed to me  that they were more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
31 
 
 
fascist, but -- than -- than -- than most Nazi
s I had known, and I knew a he
ll of a lot of Nazis, 
you know?  They were also violently anti-Semitic. 
I mean, they were much more anti-Semitic 
than any Nazis I had ever me t. And this is some
thing that  in UNRRA was 
a -- was a -- a -- a real 
problem, because we -- you know, we -- we didn™t ha
ve actually -- I mean, I 
didn™t take care of -- 
I told you that™s a -- I al
ready said this, of course, the -- th
e Jewish DP™s were taken care of 
separately by UNRRA, and that wa
s the right thing to do, because 
they were able to care for 
them properly. But there were, amongst us staff, 
of course there were Jews. We  wer e  totally 

mi xed. I me an, we came  from -- I don™t know, ther
e were 12 countries re
presented in UNRRA. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And the teams were totally mi xed, and nobody 
knew who was what religion. But it came out, 
you see, when there was this terrible anti-Semitism. 

Q: Hm. 

A: Because some how they knew who 
amongst the UNRRA staff was Jewish. 
Q: And so what would happe
n, what would that provoke? 
A: Oh, they would call them na me s i n -- in -- in 
Ukrainian, and things, which then we were told 

by our interpreters what they had said. And all of
 -- all of -- all of the 
staff were told, so of 
course, that created a very diffi
cult situation, because you see, none 
of us really could be in any 
way, anything but neutral. We  had to be neutra
l toward all of them. 
And you really couldn™t 
expect people who heard themselves called thes
e name s, like you know, Jewish pigs and all that 
sort of stuff, you couldn™t really expect them to
 behave neutrally toward
 the people who -- who -- 
who behaved like this, DPs who be haved like this. 

Q: Extraordinary in this 
time  but -- and this place. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
32 
 
 
A: Extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. So th -- it was -- it --  but it was not just  this that  
ma de it diffi cult, I mean there were -- there we
re huge difficulties, because of course the one 
thing these people who all -- who 
had all decided to stay in Ge
rmany, not to go back to the 
Ukraine, and the one thing they were afraid of 
were the Soviet liaison 
officers. [phone ringing] 
That™s yours, not mi ne. 

Q: That™s ma  -- 

A: We ll, so this was a -- this was very -- ther
e were very, very ma ny, you know, conflicts in that 
camp. And solving the conflicts, and rema ining neut
ral, and yet being in an atmosphere which 
was profoundly political was really 
very, very difficult. And it was 
not only, of course, the -- the 
DPs who -- who were difficult, but as I alrea
dy indicated, the -- the 
-- the UNRRA team was 
very divided, you know, and we had a -- we had in 
-- in -- in that place, we had an American 
director, whose name  I will not me ntion, who kne
w absolutely nothing -- like ma ny Americans, 
I™m sorry to say, at the time -- nothing about th
e problems of eastern 
Europeans. And you know, 
to be in that position, and not to
 know anything about eastern Europe
, that was impossible. It was 
really impossible, you -- you -- you di
d a lot of harm then. And we really would have needed, 
and certainly didn™t get while I was there, a 
director who -- you know, who was -- we had an 
Australian who was the deputy dire
ctor, and he was excellent. He 
was a historian, I mean he had 
a degree in history and was deep
ly interested in history. And 
he was splendid. Without him, I 
think -- I don™t know, I -- I think we would have
 had tragedies. And with
 tragedies I meant -- I 
mean more suicides. We  had suicides, but we 
would have mo re suicides, we would have had 
more violence; we had violence. So you know, we 
had all the things that we were there to 
prevent. 

Q: And lurking among those 20,000 were proba
bly some  pretty unsavory characters. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
33 
 
 
A: Oh, very unsavory characters, I mean, I wrot
e about this, I mean, so
me where. I don™t know 
whether I wrote about it in any of the books, but --
 but I certainly wrote about it for the time s. I 
mean, we -- I mean we had for mer -- for mer c
oncentration camp guards in there, which -- who -- 
who -- in -- in a few cases were in fact id
entified by for mer prisoners. But it was very 
frightening, I mean some  of them were really
 frightening people. I reme mber one person who 
was actually on the war crime list,
 and -- and I -- I found him. 
I -- I found this man. He was a 
Czech, oddly enough, and was hiding as a Ukrainia
n. Spoke some  Polish, and was very bright, 
and had done the most awful things. I mean real
ly awful things. And as I say, I was able to 
identify him, and the Americans, you know, sent 
a team to arrest him, and that was a very 
frightening evening, I tell you. Beca
use I was absolutely certain,I had no way of -- of proving 
this before, but I was absolutely
 certain that he was arme d, whic
h afterwards was found true, his 
-- his barrack -- in fact, the whole barrack was 
under his thumb, and they were arme d to the 
teeth. And of course, nobody was allowed to be 
arme d in any UNRRA ca mp, you know. And we 
had -- we had some , but it™s only 
the American army who wer e  a
llowed to search barracks. We  
were not -- nor did we 
want to, because it would have de
stroyed our -- our relationship with 
them, you know?  But we had never searched this ba
rrack, and I was absolute
ly certain they were 
arme d. And it turned out -- I mean, 
it was -- it was really scary.  
Q: Had they brought these arms with them, or
 s muggled them in, or how did they go -- 
A: God knows, God knows. 
Q: You don™t know? 

A: Never found out. All these -- th
e people in that barrack we re a
ll taken out of this particular 
team area, and were -- that was very wise, and th
ey were sent to camps in different parts of 
Germany. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
34 
 
 
Q: Talk to me  now about the stolen children, an
d about the story of Johann and Marie in -- in 
particular, that™s -- 
A: Yes, well -- 

Q: I don™t know, in any 
way that you™d like. 
A: Well the stolen children is
 again, you know, it™s a -- it was 
a -- a very complicated thing 
which -- which is true, I mean, I was certainly on
e of the people who found out about this, it was 
a -- because -- I mean, probably because I -- I spok
e, of course, fluent 
German, which very few 
of the UNRRA people did. Most of the UNRRA peopl
e came, as I said, from America, or -- or  
some  -- or from England. And then there were, of 
course, from the 12 nations, but -- but really I 
had -- I only knew one other pers
on who spoke German, fluent Ge
rman. So I did find out about 
this problem. I had no idea how wide it was. I 
mean, that only came  out when the Ame r ican 
army people -- I mean the Intelligence people really
 went into it and they -- they -- well, they 
investigated this pretty thoroughly, and so di
d the British. And it was found that, I mea n, the -- 
these children, you know, were
 all over Germany.  
Q: E-Explain for people who mi ght not know what 
the stolen children are,
 who they were, and 
how many -- 

A: We ll, the stolen children, n -- ne -- of course 
this is very important be
cause it™s -- it™s -- it™s 
part of what I was saying before, you know, about 
the problem that people see the Nazis, they 
still see the Nazis, particularly in America, as 
purely a Jewish problem. And of course, the stolen 
children are a very, very important
 proof that it wa s not that. The 
stolen children were a part of 
Hitler™s racial plan. And it was a racial, it was pure
ly racial. These children all came, almost all --  
there were some  Greek children, but most of them, 
the vast ma jority, they were supposed to have 
been in -- I can™t -- I can™t swear to this, a --
 we were given this figure, and it ma y be right, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
35 
 
 
ma y not be right, but there was supposed to be 
250,000 of them. And mo st of
 them, by far, far -- 
and the -- th -- this was -- of course, the -- the 
figure, which was confirmed by the Poles, because 
most of them ca me  from Poland and the Ukraine.
 The Nazis had ordered 
that a certain number, 
and I don™t know whether they put this number, I ha
ve no idea, but that their officials, who were 
specially assigned for this program, because this wa
s a huge project, were to bring into Germany, 
children as of age one, who were blonde and blue
 eyed. They only wanted
 blonde and blue eyed 
children, which -- which of course turned out to 
be a total nonsense because almost all children 
are blonde and blue eyed when they™re born, a
nd rema in this for, you know, quite a long time, 
into -- ma y well be two years. I mean, I had one
 little thing, a little gi
rl, who I finally got, you 
know. And who had been -- who I found -- and who 
had been stolen, and who was apparently 
blonde and blue eyed. He r foster 
parents, as I call them, I mean
 they ri -- she s -- she thought 
they were her parents, and she adored them, he
r German parents. And they told me  oh, she was 
the most beautiful blonde, blue eyed baby. A
nd do you know she was almost black haired?  And -
- and her eyes were brown. It was absolutely 
extraordinary, she was no -- and they had -- you 
know, they didn™t see this. When this woma n, she wa
s in Wi rtsburg -- I™m going to start, this all 
come s back to me . This is not this Johann a
nd -- and -- as I called them, yo -- me m -- Johann and 
Maria. These are just name s I invented, you know
, but this woma n, whe n I -- when I saw this 
little girl, you know, who was ador
able, by the way. But -- she was four, not three, she was four. 
And here™s this dark haired, brown eyed child, w
ho I wasn™t at all sure wasn™t Jewish. And this 
woma n in Wi rtsburg, this mu m, who adored this
 child, went on and on about this lovely blue 
eyed, blonde child. I finally said 
that frau whatever her name  wa
s, ﬁShe™s absolutely adorable, 
and you™ve done a wonderful job with her, but 
she is very dark haired and brown eyed.ﬂ 
[indecipherable], she said. And she -- and she lo
oked, and st -- and really she gave me the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
36 
 
 
impression -- I ma y be talking nonsense -- but shegave me  the impression as if she had never 
noticed it. To her, this was the blonde, blue 
eyed baby who had been given to her. Now these 
children who were given only -- le
t me  just say this, they were only given to me mber s of the 
Nazi party of good s -- in good standing, who wa
nted children, who either couldn™t have 
children, or whose children had 
died, or -- or whatever. There was always a good reason. And 
who were known to be, in all probability would 
be good parents. They were very, very careful 
about this. And I did not -- I met a 
lot of the parents, and of cour
se I me t a lot of the children. I 
did not meet one single child or one German 
parent where they didn™t love each other. 
Q: But of course the Germans were less careful
, the Nazis were less careful about how they 
actually got these children. They 
kidnapped them from this -- 
A: Oh no, they -- they were totally uncareful. I 
mean, they kidnapped them off the streets, they 
went int -- they went into nurseries, they went 
into -- into schools. I mean, it was absolutely 
appalling how they did it. And the parents -- 
Q: Did the program have a name ?  I mean, th -- 
A: In -- the German name, there was a na
me , but I™ve forgotten it now. I™m sorry.  

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: I™ve forgotten that it -- it di
d have a name , but I™ve forgotten 
it. I can look it up, but that™s too 
late for you. No, I™ve forgotten what the German na
me  was. But they -- but I certainly know how 
they did it, and of course I -- I 
-- I ma naged to see -- I -- I took 
one train back, of -- of stolen 
children. We -- of course we found quite a few of 
them, and this one train I took back, it was an 
extraordinary experience, really. 

Q: Back to Poland? 

A: Back to Poland, yes, and thes
e we re desperate children, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
37 
 
 
Q: How old were they? 
A: Well, ther e were small ones. I mean, this is -- the 
four year old was part of
 it, of this particular 
group. But I mean, they were up to, you know, 10. 
They tried to take them under 10, below 10. 

But they did have some  children who were scho
ol children. I mean eight -- seven, eight, nine. 
And -- and this was particularly difficult for th
em, too, because the smaller ones, of course, you 
know, they didn™t know really, what 
had happened. If they were very small, I mean babies, like 
my little --  this little four year ol d, she didn™t 
-- she had absolutely no idea that there was a Polish 
parent. Of course not. And she adored her -- of 
course she adored her -- her Wi rtsburg parents. 
But the older children -- I mean, we had -- we al
ready, when we had them in our camp, because 
we would -- we had them in conditioning camps
, you know, we opened special stolen children 
conditioning centers. 

Q: Wh -- kind of a staging post that -- 

A: Staging post, conditioning centers we called 
them to ourselves, where the children received 
that kind of care that -- you know, that was needed 
at the time. I mean, also they received lessons 
in Polish or Ukrainian. And so on and so forth. A
nd -- and -- and they stayed for awhile, I mean 
they stayed two, three months in these cam
ps, and were very unhappy, very unhappy. They™ve 
been taken away from pe ople they
 loved, even though they knew that
 there were -- the older ones 
I™m now spe a king of -- they knew that there were 
parents elsewhere who were their real parents. 
But you see they -- they had been there for three 
or four years in Germany, they had had no bad 
experiences. They had only been love d. And if they had not been, because some  of them could 

not be kept in fa milies, and they were  sent to 
Hitler youth, well really centers. But there agai n, 
you see, I mean I™ve -- you know, I™v
e been to these Hitler youth 
centers, and I -- I know it™s not 
popular, particularly in America for one to say th
is, but you know, they were very well run. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
38 
 
 
the young people who were in charge of them we
re good people. They were not bad people. And 
they -- when they got these young, foreign kids, th
ey were nice to them. There was a lot of 
tenderness. I mean, I went to one camp where th
ey were in fact I -- 
I -- I fo -- I found, you know, 
one -- one little eight year old boy 
who had been there for two years.
 And -- and I stayed in a -- 
in an UNRRA center, in an untr -- UNRRA ca mp
 -- not camp, but in an UNRRA team in the 
same  town. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And -- because I wanted this 
little boy to get to know me slow
ly, because I was going to take 
him away. And he had been taken away now so
 ma ny ti me s, you know. So I didn™t want to do 
this suddenly. So I thought I™d give
 him four days, which isn™t long. 
Q: Yes. 

A: But you know, it™s as long as one could -- could 
afford really, in a way. And so I would go 
and spend most of the day there, so that he w
ould see me  all the time . And I would be there in 
the evening, and I saw these Hitl
er youth leaders, as they we
re called, go around the beds, and 
kiss the children good night, and tuck them in, 
and you know, and -- and -- and smooth their hair, 
and -- oh, and they also asked, did you clean your 
teeth and all the rest. 
[indecipherable] like all 
parents do. But I never heard any cross word. Of c
ourse, boys of that age, I mean, th-they also 
learned to march. We ll of course they did, but of c
ourse they adored that, th
ey liked it. Then they 
had open fires you know, in the evening, and they
 sang songs, and theselittle Polish boys, well 

they would -- when they came, I was told, th
ey would -- they would -- they didn™t speak any 

German, and so they would slowly be taught 
by the other children, 
who were absolutely 
charmi ng to them. It was -- it was strange, becau
se  I knew that I was -- I was seeing so me thing 
that one would t -- y -- di -- you know, that one should really, you know, hate, because it was -- it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
39 
 
 
was [indecipherable] being hateful.
 And not at all, they were a
ll terribly nice. You know, life was 
more compl e x then. Primo Levi wrote in one of his books that -- 
Q: May we turn this -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an 
interview with Gitta Sereny. Sorry, you were saying 
Primo Levi. 

A: Yes, but I can™t -- I can™t reme mb er unfort
unately, the exact quote, so I™m -- I™m not saying 
that I™m quoting him verbatim, but he said someth
ing about that nothing in
 these situations was 
black and white, it was all gray. And that is, you 
know, the fantastic lesson 
that those of us who 
really worked with this --  with this -- these 
DPs, and with these children and -- and with the 
Germans who -- who -- who had these children, and 
all the rest of it, you know -- and then with 
the Polish parents -- oh God almi ghty, the Polish 
parents, who of course, you know, they -- I was 
comi ng to that, but I™m -- it was -- it was 
all gray. There was no -- there was nobody who was 
terrible, or who was -- who was wonderful. It wa sn™t
 really like that. They
 were just ordinary, 
really, in a way. But everybody -- th
at™s the extraordinary thing, 
everybody was capable of love 
for children. It was certainly true of all the pa
rents I me t, and I certainly me t -- I would have 
thought, at least a hundred coupl
es who had such children. 
Q: You know, I really don™t envy 
you this job. Did you actually have to remove children from 
one set of --  

A: Yes. 

Q: -- parents and deliver them to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
40 
 
 
A: Yeah, we did, yeah, terrible, 
terrible. But thank God I didn™t ha
ve to do it often. I me an thank 
God by that time I was promoted and you know, this
 was left to -- oh, this  -- I was able to you 
know, peop -- other people could do this, so I di
dn™t have to do this. It was a terrible thing, 
terrible. It was a terr -- and -- 
and you know, one didn™t know what 
was right. One really didn™t 
know. I mean, I cannot tell you how ma ny cases ther
e were where I -- I really wondered whether 
I was doing the right thing. Should they not be stay
ing with these -- partic
ularly the little ones, 
should they not be staying with 
these parents they adored, who a
dored them?  They were children 
who had never learned any language except Germa
n. They knew nothing about Poland or the 
Ukraine. And what was going to meet them when
 they went back?  And 
that™s what I found out 
of course, when I took that one 
train back. It was -- you know, it wa
s a -- a trauma tic experience, 
because the -- the -- the -- the ch
ildren were isolated from these parent s, who were expe cting 
them with open -- oops, sorry -- 

Q: That™s okay. 
A: -- with open arms, and with open emotions a
nd with -- you know, it was 
all so emotional. And 
-- and the children could not give. They couldn™t give what th
ese parents wanted. And when 
these parents took them in their arms , the childr
en shied away from the m. It was absolutely 
terrible. And there was one -- I mean, there was -- 
I -- I made one trip afte
rwards, and went back 
to three of these couples. 
Q: I was going to ask you that. 

A: I went back to three, I couldn™t do more. But 
I went back to three of
 the couples. In only one 
of them it had worked. And I was told th
at it hardly worked
 in any of them. 
Q: When you say worked, I mea
n, the children run away, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
41 
 
 
A: The children -- no, th
e chil -- the children ra
n away, the children were trauma tized, the 
children wer -- were doing terrib
ly badly at school, the childre
n were -- we re -- were naughty, 
were -- were violent, were everything you -- ev
ery problem that we know that children have, 
they had. The children wa nted back. I mean the tw
o of the ones where I we nt, of the three, the 
children told me  where they want
 back, they wanted to go back to Germany, they hated Poland, 
they hated every mi nute they had spent there. 
They couldn™t get on with anybody, the language is 
horrible, their language is German. They didn™t like the music, and you know, Polish music is 
beautiful. They didn™t like the music, they di
dn™t like anything. And 
I said, ﬁYou™re being 
totally,ﬂ -- these were older -- these two were older.
 I said, ﬁYou™re being totally negative, this is, 
you know, quite wrong, you™re not helping.ﬂ ﬁWe are 
too young to help.ﬂ Quite right, too. They 

were too young to help. It was aski
ng too much of children, you know.  
Q: So what was -- what was the effect on you 
of having to, you know, witness these ghastly 
things, and do these pr
etty ghastly jobs? 
A: We ll, you -- you say ghastly, but of course, 
you know, they weren™t gh
astly at the time. I 
mean, the problems were terrible, but you know, we 
are -- we are -- if we
 are adults, you know, 
if we are adults, and I of course, became  adult 
very early. And if you are-- in particular if you 
are -- were also a ma n, it™s -- I was just going to sa y particularly if you are a girl, but it™s not so. I 

mean, I -- we -- I had colleagues, particular ly if
 I think of this Australian I have already 
me ntioned, you know, who had exactly the same , if you 
like, gifts that I had, which was A, to be 
able to see both sides, which is very important, 
cause it™s the only way to be -- to ma intain some  
kind of objectivity or neut
rality, is to be able to
 see both sides of each question. But also who -- 
you a -- you know, who had the kind of need to give 
to children. This is one of the things that 
you really needed. You needed to be the kind of 
person -- I mean, if you were a child welfare 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
42 
 
 
officer in UNRRA, you needed to be the kind of 
person who needed to give to children. Of 
course, if I turn this on, it won™t co
me  on. I have to turn it on over there. 
Q: Don™t worry, I™ll do it. Let me  -- 
A: No, no, it has to be over there. 

Q: I™ll go over there [tape break] – ask you about 
the German NS trials and what -- what it was 
like to be there, and -- 

A: We ll, sure, I don™t know what to say about
 that. I mean, I went to so ma ny of them. 
Q: Why did you go? 

A: Well I -- I really went becau
se I was very interested, but also because I was working for the 
ﬁDaily Telegraph Magazineﬂ at the time , and they
 had a wonderful editor there, I wrote about 
him, John Anstey, and -- and he was very interested in this problem, and so he -- he backed me , 

you know, he backed me  for all these things, 
and you -- you had to have some body like that if 
you were going to go do -- you know, I mean I -- I went
 to these trials for six months. So of 
course he -- he paid all the expenses. I mean, you
 can imagine what that costs. Not to speak of 
my time, but  he didn™t pay much
 for that, I™ve got to say. 
Q: But you went backwards and forwards, or you stayed there? 

A: Yeah -- no, no, I s -- I would stay for -- fo
r weeks and come back, which was not very good 
for my fa mi l y, I mean it was -- it™s terrible what
 one does to one™s family, really, you know. One 
thinks that this is all so importa
nt, but of course, as I found out la
ter, I me an it certainly -- I -- I -- 
I -- it was not very good for my boy, 
who was, of course, in boarding school, but I mean, even 
so, it was not good for him. He didn™t see very mu
ch of me . Well, anyway
 -- but these trials 
were, of course, fascinating, and it wa s fascina
ting to write about them, you know. And I learned 
an awful lot. But what -- what was most important
 to me in the end was that -- that  it was not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
43 
 
 
through trials that one could find out what these 
pe ople were about, because 
trials are limited in 
what they can find out, however good the prosecuto
r is, you know. And this 
-- it happened to be 
the one -- the one who was involved in most of 
these trials in Düsseldorf was a very, very good 
prosecutor called Alfred Spiess, who became a great 
friend of mi ne, at last he died. But he -- he 
was a -- a very bright  ma n, and he tried in fact, 
to enlarge these questions, too, because he also 

wanted to know, you know?  But he had to find out 
that it was simply not possible. I mean, the 

courtroom does not lend itself to this. So this is
 where I really got the 
idea. Wit -- no, it wasn™t 
where I got the idea, but certainly where the idea st
rengthened in my mi nd th
at -- that I wanted to 
find some body I could talk to. One of these people 
who -- cause most of t hem, you se e, just said 
they were not guilty, they -- you know, they -- th
ey -- they -- they were acting under orders, 
which is true of course, they were acting unde
r orders and they -- th
ey couldn™t have done 
anything but what they did, which of course is not tr
ue. But that™s all they -- 
that™s all, really, one 

got out of most of them. And I was looking for 
one where there was -- there was some  remnant 
of conscience. I can™t tell you how 
difficult that was. I mean, all 
the trials I saw,
 the one I found, 
finally found Stangl, was the only one And Spiess said the same  thing. He ma y -- he -- you 

know, brought my attention to -- to Stangl, he r
eally presented him to 
me . He -- he phoned me  
and said, ﬁLook, I think I™ve now got the ma n here in
 front of me . You mu st come  very quickly.ﬂ 
And so I took the next plane to Düsseldorf, and went
 to the trial, to the Stangl trial, which went 
on for 10 months. 

Q: Wa s this1970? 

A: It was 1969, I think. 

Q: ™69. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
44 
 
 
A: Yeah. I™m not absolutely sure about that
, but I think so. Anyway, it™s in my book. And you 
know, after one day of sitting there,
 I knew that -- that -- that Spie
ss had hit the nail on the head. 
This was a slightly different ma n. It was -- thedegree was very small, how he was different, but 
there was just -- there was a sadne
ss about Stangl, which I had not 
found in any of the others, and 
which Spiess had not found in any of the others. Th
ey were arrogant, they were hard. They were 
proud of what they had done. Sta
ngl was not proud. And quite aside from that, he was sad. And I 
thought, if he was capable of being sad, unless we fi
nd out that it™s only about
 his situation, if he 
was capable of being sad about the whole thing, then there was that remnant of conscience, 

which of course I did find in him. Took me  a l
ong time. Took me  a very long time to find it, but I 

did find it. And he was the right choice. I mean, I 
couldn™t have done this w
ith -- with any of the 
others. I me t several of the others before, and of c
ourse after I me t hi m. And -- and tried to talk to 
them, too. And only one of I me t, who -- but he wa s 
not -- he was just not 
as intelligent. I mean, 
Stangl was not very intelligent, but he was moreintelligent. And in fact,if he hadn™t been more 
intelligent, he wouldn™t have been given the job he was given. I mean, he was a -- he had an 
enormous job. I mean, commandant of Trebli
nka and comma ndant of Sobibor, you could not 
have a bigger job in that branch 
of the SS or Gestapo. It was impo
ssible to have a bigger job. So 
of course he had the qualifica
tions. He was a brilliant organi
zer, which is what was mostly 
needed. And -- and he wa s a -- he was a ma n, in a way -- don™t mi sunderstand it, but he -- he was 

a ma n in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices. He was not a drunkard, he didn™t play 

around with wome n. He didn™t, of co
urse, didn™t gamble, or anythi
ng like that. And he was not a 
ma n given to violence. So there were four
 things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who 
appointed him saw just as much as I did. I mea
n, they had him first -- his first assignme nt, his 
first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course
, an Austrian. He was from We ls in Austria. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
45 
 
 
was a provincial. And his first assignme nt as a 
police officer, was to become  the police head of 
Schloss Hartheim, which was a euthanasia in
stitute. Bad enough, God knows. And there -- and 
th-these euthanasia institutes, where they appoi
nted 96 SS people to become  either heads or, you 
know, or officials there. Always in higher posi
tions, of course. Under them they would have 
Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually Baltics. They
 could, of course obser ve and -- and see these 
quote, qualities, unquote, which I have  me ntioned. B
ecause already in the euthanasia institute, I 
mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualiti
es. And so he was -- he wa s predestined to be 
promoted, there™s no doubt about it.
 And then he -- he -- he got 
these two jobs, first at -- in 
Sobibor, as a kind of preparati
on, which he opened, which he started, built. And then of course, 
the worst one of them all, Treblinka, I mean th
at was the worst place. Oh, I don™t know whether 
any of them were worse than any other. I mea
n, the -- that™s -- they 
-- they were places, you 
know, which only existed for killing, I mean, th
ey were not for anything else. Which probably 
it™s -- it™s too extrao
rdinary that -- that -- that 60 years la
ter you have the same mi sapprehension, 
or mi scomprehension of these pl aces, which ha -- 
which existed then. I mean, even now, again, 
this book I™ve just finished reading, which is about
 to come out in America, I mean again, I mean 
these pl aces are -- Dachau is conc -- is -- is 
described as an extermin
ation camp. I mean, total 
nonsense, you know, it™s full of total nonsense.The -- the whole problem, which has been 

written about more than any other -- what, any ot
her event in history, this extermination of the 
Jews, I mea n it™s -- really, it™s -- 
it™s just incr
edible the number of books
 and -- and essays, and 
newspaper a -- films, what -- what have you, whic
h have been done on this subject, and still 
people don™t know. Too extraordinary. 
Anyway, there were only -- th
ere were only four of such 
camps, whic h were only there for exterminati
ng people, that nobody spent a night there, nobody 
had a meal there. Nobody washed there. They
 came  in, they were killed, that™s it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
46 
 
 
Q: There was nothing except -- 
A: We ll, there was a -- there were so-called wo
rk Jews, where they took out of every transport 
which arrived, of perhaps, you know, up to 10,000 pe
ople, they would take five, or whatever, 
who looked young and strong, possibly spoke a la
nguage or two. Possibly some body l i ked the 
looks of them. Ho -- what do I know how I chose them?  But they chose them, and -- and they 

were allowed to live for a while, working the camp. The camp had to be worked. The Germans 

didn™t work the camp, and the Baltics didn™t work 
the camp. It™s perfectly true that the work 
Jews worked the camp. And it allowed them to survive, ma ybe for a week, ma ybe for a month. 

Some  of them just survived. And you know this 
was a question I asked -- have asked myself a 
million times since then -- not a million, but 
one says a million, but countless times -- what 
would I have done?  And all these 
people who so readily judge such
 me n and wome n, instead of 
judging they should ask themselves this question. 
I mean, how dear is life to us. And I tell you 
life is very dear to us, an
d I am not sure, I am not sure at all,
 and really I do have principles, but 
I™m not sure at all that I would not have done what
 they did. After all, as work Jews, they could 
help people. They could, and did, very often. They 
also could be absolutely
 terrible, and some  of 
them were. Absolutely terrible. Worse than th
e Germans, certainly. But my God, what would 
you choose? What would you have chos
en?  Did you ever think about that? 
Q: Many time s. Many times. I™m just very grateful I was never tested. 

A: Yeah, so am I. So a m I, because my God, you 
know, to answer that honestly is very difficult. 
Q: Mm. 

A: But I think I would have accepted the offer, 
to stay alive. You know, some  -- I mean, I™ve 
talked to -- to wome n, not ma ny, but I™ve talked
 to wome n who -- who did it by -- by becomi ng -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
47 
 
 
- you know, by becomi ng the mi stress of -- of this or
 that -- either -- either [indecipherable] or 
German SS. Well, I don™t know whether I wouldn™t have. 

Q: Mm. 

A: I™m not sure I wouldn™t have. 

Q: It™s impossible to say. 

A: The thing is that death was so obvious. You see,
 it is -- I mean, they say now that these people 
didn™t know. We ll, of course they didn™t know wh
en they arrived, but my God, within mi nutes, 

within seconds they knew, because the work Jews told them at once. They had not even got off 

the trains and they knew. And if
 -- if -- if the work Jews saw some body t hey liked, whose looks 
they liked, or who smiled at them even, I mean the smallest thing could do it. They would say 

don™t do that, don™t do that. Say you 
are that, say you are this, wh
en you are asked. Behave like 
this or that. They would whisper to them
, in wha t ever language, you know, communi cation -- 
they could communicate. And they 
saved lives that way, of course. 
Q: So y -- to take you back to Stangl, you™ve 
explained your motivation 
in seeking him out, can 

you remi nd us very swiftly how he es
caped, and how he came to trial? 
A: How he escaped, oh God. We ll, he escaped in 
Austria. Le t me  try and think, I™ve forgotten 
now. Oh, he  escaped, how did he escape?  I™ve 
forgotten how he escaped, I™d have to -- 
Q: Was it with the help of the Vatican [i ndecipherable] 

A: -- I™d have the -- well, no, no, he didn™t escape 
with the help of the aust -- I mean he -- he 
escaped with his own -- you know, by 
his own intelligence, but he -- he -- he esca -- he used the 
Vatican escape route. There was an Austrian
 -- an Austrian bishop, whose name  I™ve now 
forgotten. You know, it™s impossible to -- to keep
 all these name s in one™s mi nd. But anyway, 
whose name  I have now forgotten, but this bishop
 was the link man for this so-called Vatican 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
48 
 
 
escape route, and had also the means -- I mean, wa
s able to provide them with the means -- that 
is, Red Cross passports, and things
 like this, which they had to have because they had to cross 
borders, you know. 
Q: Sure. 

A: And they had to get to Rome . I mean, they 
have to get Rome  if 
they were going to get 
anywhere. And this is certainly 
what happened in Stangl™s case. 
I mean, he was -- he was -- he 
went to this, he heard about this bishop, he went 
to him, he -- the bishop kept him there for a wh 
-- a few days, to let him rest and to -- and to prep
are the papers. And then 
he gave him the papers 
he needed, gave him some money. A
nd of course this is a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible 

thing, but there you were. The Catholic church
 did ma ny terrible things, they did ma ny not 

terrible things. It™s -- again, 
it™s a gray area. Again, nothing 
is black and white. You know, and 
they were wonderful people, they were nuns. I 
mean, God almi ghty, wha t  the nuns did in Austria 
and Germany is fantastic. You know, the number of
 people they hid, children. They hid Jewish 
children, but not you f -- for -- for a night or fo
r a week, but for months, months. And you -- you 
have to try and imagine what it™s like to live 
in a Nazi country, and to hide a number of Jewish 
grown-ups, Jewish children. It
 -- it -- it -- I mean -- you know
, death was always around the 

corner, I me an just around the corner. And the Nazi
s had absolutely no reason 
to --  to -- to spare 
a nun. They disliked the nuns as muc h as th
ey dus -- disliked anybody. They disliked the 
Catholics. So, it was dangerous. So if -- if we sa
y, you know, that like this bishop, he ju -- he was 
doing terrible things by saving people such as Stangl, 
yes he did, he was. It was terrible. But just 
at the same time, there were wonderful people w
ho saved people. And it is 
absolutely true that 
this bishop, of course, did not know what Stangl
 had done, because of co
urse, he wasn™t told. 
They were very careful not to tell him what th
ese individuals had done. Would he have helped 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
49 
 
 
him anyway?  I think he would have. Because A, 
I think he  was a Nazi, and B, he was not a good 
ma n. I think he would have, but purely factuall
y, he did not know w
ho these people were.  
Q: Stangl was finally tracked down wher
e, in Brazil? Wa s he  brought back -- 
A: In Brazil, he was tracked down -- he was tr
acked down in fact -- well, Wi esenthal, Simon 
Wi esenthal said he tracked him down. Stangl sa
id this was not true. But you know, are we going 
to believe Stangl rather than Simon Wi esenthal, it™
s very difficult. It™s a very complicated story 
how he was tracked down, and it -- a
nd I think that actually Wi esen
thal did have a hand in it. I 
don™t think he actually discovered 
him, but he had a hand in it. 
Q: What persuaded Stangl to sit down and talk to you? 
A: I tell you something, I think all 
-- all people wa nt to talk. Ex
cept me , I™m not very eager to 
talk. But then, I really have not
hing to hide, I don™t think. But a
ll these people who lived hidden 
lives, they all wanted to talk. I thi
nk that basically, I mean, if you want
 to talk ab -- if you want to 
consider this from a human point
 of -- or a humane point of view, I think they were all very 
lonely. You know, most of them were separated 
by prison and other, from their fami lies, their 
wives, thei r children. I mean, certainly in Stangl™s
 case this was so. Saw themselves sentenced, if 
not to death, because the death penalty had been
 abolished, but certainly to life in prison. You 
know, and they were young, I mean, they were not 
old me n. Stangl, I can™t reme mber  how old he 
was, but he was certainly not more than what, 
35 or 38, I mean he was -- he was young. And the 
earliest he could have got out of prison -- this is
 -- he was sentenced to life imprisonment, was 
when he was 60. Now just imagine a life like that
. We ll, I mean, course criminals, you know, we 
know this, this happens to -- to many criminals.
 But of course, he di
dn™t consider hims elf a 
criminal, not until after he talked
 to me that he began to se
e what the rest of us thought. 
However, there were other reasons why he -- I think, 
why he -- at wa -- he 
talked -- he started to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
50 
 
 
agree to talk to me  because his appeal was goi
ng to come  up, a nd he thought that I was going to 
help him. Now, I -- I -- I -- I -- I™d disabused
 him of this idea, because I had told hi m 
imme diately that I would not he
lp, and that what I would write
 would do absolutely nothing 
toward helping his appeal. But that if he talked to
 me , and if he talked to
 me  fully, I would write 
everything he said, everything for,
 everythi ng against, whatever he
 said, I would write it. And by 
this time  there was the other element, which wa
s A, Stangl -- you have to
 understand this, Stangl 
was an Austrian, this why I imme diately said he 
was a provincial Austrian. And we talked to, in 
my kind of German, which is of course uppe
r class German, we talked to by a young woma n, 
which I was at the time -- I mean, a youngish woma n. A youngish woma n, you know, a -- 
some body who represented some thing. A lady. He™d 
never met a lady in his life. And suddenly 
there was this lady who was willing to talk to him,
 and listen to him. This was extraordinary for 
him. It™s very hard to explain this to 
people who don™t know Europe. You know, who don™t know 
what a provincial Austrian is, or Hungarian. It™s
 very much the same . And I think that this 
weighed as heavily fi
nally, as anythi -- 
Q: So it was a kind of an honor to him to be talking -- 

A: It was a kind of an honor, and the -- the direct
or of the prison in Düsseldorf, whose name  is 
Mies, and who is a really good ma n, very good wife, t
oo. I saw a lot of them. And he said that -- 
he went to see Stangl quite ofte
n, quite often in the evening after 
he had talked to me . And Stangl 
was in a state of -- this wa s such an experien
ce for him, you know?  And he would start talking 
about, you know, the way I asked him questions a
nd so on. And he would tell him that -- that, 
you know, she asked me  -- he would tell Mies th
at, well [inaudible] I was the countess, of 
course, yeah -- what can I do
?  ﬁYou know,ﬂ he said, ﬁthe countess asks me such difficult 
questions. They are really very, 
very difficult, but she asks them
 in such a way, you know, that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
51 
 
 
-- I feel I -- nots -- not that I can, I must answ
er.ﬂ It™s wonderful, I m
ean it™s -- it™s really 
wonderful, but it™s -- it™s -- you 
know, I™ve said this to lots and lots of young journalists, who of 
course, I mean, would love to do this sort of thing. But honestly you ha
ve to -- you -- you really 
have to think whether you can c
onfront people like this. And whet
her you can be -- it™s very 
difficult -- whether you can rema in -- not just pr
etend, that™s easy, but inside yourself, retain 
some  kind of objectivity.

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial
 Museum interview with Gitta Sereny, conducted 
by Vera Frankel on February 28
th
, 2004, in London. This is tape number three, side A. 
A: I mean that -- that [tape pause] 
Q: What ma de it possible for you to do that?  Wher
e d -- what is it, do you think, that ma de it 
possible for you to -- 

A: We ll, I think it™s A, it™s because I™m not Jewi
sh. I don™t think this is possible for a Jewish girl, 

or a Jewish woma n to do. It™s no
t -- it™s not possible, it™s just
 too difficult. It™s emotionally 
impossible, because this is the man who killed
 them, and you can™t, I mean you can™t. If you -- if 
you carry the weight of your religion, or your
 -- you know, or your b
ackground, your roots, your 
parents, your grandparents, I mean how can you? How can you?   

Q: Nonetheless, how did you feel, knowing who he 
was, sitting down, looking at him for the first 
time, beginning to delve around in his psyche -- 
A: Listen, he was just a ma n. He wa s just a ma
n. He was -- he -- he became  a bad ma n, but he 
was not bad ma n when he was 
born, you know?  He was a perfectly
 okay ma n when he was born. 
He had a terrible childhood, which always count
s. It™s always very 
important. A terrible 
childhood, and he some how got through this child
hood because he fell in love. And he really 
adored his wi fe , who was almost as guilty as he in my eyes.  
Q: In what way? 

A: We ll, she could have stopped him. 

Q: Oh, she had the power, you mean? 

A: Of course she had the power. She had the po
wer, and you know wha t  her power was, a -- her 
sex was the power. They were two people who were
 sexually so attune d to each other, and so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
53 
 
 
important to each other, that th
e relationship was three quarters 
sexual, and one quarter whatever 
else there is. In most our re
lationships with our husbands, 
you know, it™s the other way -- it 
become s to be the othe r way around, because you can™t ma intain this sexual exciteme nt, you 
know, for more than what, three years?  I mean, that
™s already extraordinaryif you maintain it for 
three years. Afterwards, well, it™s 
-- sex is part of it, but it™s a ti
ny part of a re -- a relationship. A 
relationshi p is -- is fr iendship, is love. And their 
love was very sexual. And had she been a better 
woma n, a stronger woman, and not just a -- a de
vout Catholic, as the book says you must be a 
devout Catholic, that™s all she was. She could have  used that sex to get him out of it, because she 

should have known that even according to he
r own religion, which she so -- you know, so 

devoutly believed in, he was going to hell. He
 was lost. And she allowed him to be lost. 
Q: It™s interesting, you seem at this stage to ha
ve more compa ssion for him than for her, in a 
way. 

A: Yes, because wome n have terrible power, you know
, and if they don™t use this power the right 
way, I despise them. I despise them. I think -- 
and it isn™t, you know, it re
ally isn™t that wome n 
don™t know that they ha ve  this power. You don™t ha
ve to be an intelligent woman to know that 
you have power. 

Q: But you have to have some qualities that ar -- th
at are irresi stible, and be aware that you have 
them. I don™t think all wo me n can be said to be
 aware of that kind of thing. I mean, doubtless 
this, you know, this woma n clearly was -- 

A: I think that if you -- 
if -- if you have a very strong sexua
l relationship with a ma n, you already 
know that you have the power, you know?  Or, if you 
have love, and even if you don™t have that 
sexual relationship any more, you know what th
e love means to the ma n. And what the 
withdrawal of such love would mean. No, no, 
no, wome n are very powerful. I™m not saying all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
54 
 
 
wome n are equally powerful, but wome n on the whol
e, are very powerful. And if they don™t use 
this power for the good, their own good, their hus
band™s good, ha -- theirchildren™s good, then 
they are despicable. Much more despicable than
 me n, who are very often 
quite weak. Stangl was 
certainly weak, I mean there™s no doubt about it,
 he was weak. Which is one of the reasons, 
probably why he did what he did, cause it ma de hi
m feel strong. I me an, it was incredible to be -- 
can you imagine what it is like to be in the pos
ition where you are the --the -- the -- the -- the 
god over life and death, not just of a fe w people, 
but of hundred thousands of
 people?  I mean, i-is 
it imaginable? 
Q: But did you get any clue as 
he -- ho -- as to how he did this
 day to day?  Where he was -- 
A: Oh yes, I mean certainly, my -- my book is full of
 it, it tells it very cl
early, but I me an, I can™t 
do this here, it wa -- it™s a huge -- 

Q: Give me  a sense. 

A: -- long story, I mean wa -- 
Q: Give me  a sense of how a person 
does that, or how Stangl did that. 
A: We ll he -- how did he do it?  I me a n, I™m ju
st -- don™t quite know how I could answer that 
question how. I mean the qu -- 
better question is probably why. 
Q: Okay. 
A: Why did he do it?  And I think he  did it because yes, it ma de him feel strong. He knew of his 

weakness, and he had to be strong, because hi s wi
fe, who was more impor tant to him than life, 

really, could not love a weak ma n. So you see, 
he accepted a job in the police. You reme mber, 
accepted a job in the police, that was when he was a very young ma n, and he -- he was a weaver 

by profession. Gave that up, went into the police,
 why did he go in the 
police?  I asked him why, 
why?  And he said, ﬁOh, you know, they had thes
e wonderful uniforms, and they were so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
55 
 
 
important.ﬂ That™s where it started. And the 
m - -  you know, the further he went, then the 
euthanasia, for God™s sake. I mean, think of the 
importance -- how impor tant he was in a place 
where they were murdering -- we call it murder, th
ey of course, didn™t. Mercy killing they called 
it, which is not something that is completely st range to us. 

Q: Is that what he called it still when he spoke to you? 

A: Absolutely, absolutely. He said you cannot
 -- you -- you find this in there, he wa -- you 
cannot imagine what they were like. You cannot 
imagine when they arrived, what they were. 
Q: We ll of course I can imagine. I mean, I have 
been in insane asylums.
 I have been in many 
handicapped institutions -- in-insti
tutions for the handicapped. And th
e -- it can be terrible, and if 
you are uninterested, or if you are not capable of -- of communicating, if y
ou like, i-inside, with 
the -- the spirit of these people, of such pe
ople -- and you know with -- with ma ny insane, you 
cannot communicate, but with the handicapped, 
you can communicate. But if you are incapable 
of it, and only see these totally destroyed bodies
, which is very often the case, well then you -- 
you know then of course you will think they would 
be better off dead, as one of the nuns he 
talked to, a Mother Superior said she felt they 
we re better off bed in -- 
dead in heaven. We ll of 
course she would feel that, wouldn™t she?  No, no
t of course, but it is 
understandable that she 
mi ght. But think what science, what our -- what
 our generation -- and I 
know nothing about this, 
you know, because I am not a scientist, I am not 
a ma the matician, I -- it™s simply not my thing. 
But what would our generation have done withou
t Stephen Ha wking?  And here is a man whose 
body is totally destroyed, and whose spirit is to
tally there. Now what -- what -- can you imagine 
what the Nazis would have done to St ephen Ha
wking?  I mean, people should think that way. 
Q: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
56 
 
 
A: And of c ourse Stangl would have thought th
at it was a me rcy to kill Stephen Haw -- Stephen 
Hawking. Because he would never, never have been 
capable of seeing that sp
irit, of feeling that. 
Q: And wha t  did he feel at
 Treblinka, what did he come  to fee l , if anything? 
A: At Treblinka, well that was different, of cour
se. I mean, this -- the -- one -- one cannot for a 
mome nt for get the pre -- you know, conditioning
 all these Austrians and Germans -- mostly 
Austrians by the way, who were the supervisors 
of these extermination camps. I mean, their -- 
their -- you know, their preconditio
ning was the most extreme th
at you can think of -- which 
ended, of course, if you like, or it began with th
e euthanasia. But -- but -- 
by the time  they were 
sent to the euthanasia institutions, th -- the -- the 
authorities knew that they were capable of it. 
Q: How do you test these people, before 
he goes, say to that institution? 
A: He was -- he was a bl -- I mean, I was absolutely convinced from what  he told me , that he wa 
-- that he was, you know, even before he was sent to
 Berlin to talk to psychiatrists, which they 
did before he was assigned to the euthanasia. 
But even before that, they -- of course they 
observed him. They observed him in his police wo
rk. He said they couldn™t have observed me , 
because I didn™t do anything. You don™t have to 
do anything. The question is how you behave. 
How you talk to your superiors, or to your comr ad
es, or to those you arrest, or whatever. There 
are a million ways. I me a n, you can do this here. You can talk, you can find out -- I me an, you 

could -- you could -- you could talk to different 
police officers here, a
nd after half an hour, you, 
for instance, you would know what they were ab
out. And I would know what they were about. 
You know, it™s -- it™s -- it™s impossible to 
hide if you are a certain kind of person. 
Q: But there must be a difference. I 
mean, there must be a -- th -- th -- 
A: I™m not saying that every police officer -- 

Q: No, no, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
57 
 
 
A: -- but I don™t mean th
at at all, of course. 
Q: No, but there must -- must have been some th
ing in him that -- you know, that Treblinka was 
so special, and so awful. 

A: Yeah, but there were 96 SS 
me n, young me n like he, and even younger, who were part of this, 
in these four camps. 96 of them. 

Q: How old was he when he became commandant, do you reme mber? 

A: I don™t reme mber, no, but it™s
 in the book, I™m sure. I don™t 
reme mber how old he was. 
Q: And how did you bring yourself day after da
y to go back and liste
n, and probe, and -- 
A: Oh, but -- but -- but listen, this
 was fa scinating. Let™s not forget
 this. I mean, fi rst of all I was 
doing some thing -- and I really don™t mean this 
in any, you know, in any journalistic way, but I 
mean it was some thing that hadn™t been done befo
re, and that needed to be done, to my mi nd. 
Q: Sure. 

A: And I was -- I was getting -- very
 slowly getting a feel of -- of
 -- you know, of the thing that I 
was looking for, very slowly. Took a long time. 

Q: How long did you spend with him in all? 

A: I spent three weeks with him,
 every day. And then I went back and spent another week with 
him. So all together I spent four weeks with 
him. But this -- these were long days, you know. I 
mean, I ca me there at nine in the morning, stayed 
until ha lf past 12, I think it was, came  back at a 
half past one, and stayed until fi ve. Now -- during which time he talked all the time .  

Q: What is it that™s kind of burned itself into 
your mi nd of -- of what he
 told you?  What are the 
images, or the particular st
ories that you can™t forget? 
A: Well, first, no -- I do -- I can™t tell the stor ies,
 but I mean what -- what  set -- burnt itself into 
my mi nd at first, and which ha
s been confirme d by -- you know, by -- by ma ny other talks I™ve 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
58 
 
 
had with people such as Stangl, is
 their self pity. I mean, fi rst there is the self pity which is 
perfectly justified, abou
t their childhoods. Every one of them
 had a terrible childhood, I mean it™s 
extraordinary. It™s extraordinary, 
I™m -- I™m horrified at the numb
er of terrible childhoods there 
are. And it™s true, you know, b
ecause I looked into it 
afterwards in each case, and I found out, 
absolutely confirme d, be aten, a
ll the rest of it, you know. Abs o
lutely true. And -- and these 
children are conditioned, fo
r God™s sake, for violence. You be 
violent with a child, and the child 
in conditioned toward violence. I™m not saying that 
every child that is beaten as a child is going 
to become  a Stangl, of course not. But if the circumstances are created, where becomi ng a 
Stangl, or some thing like that, is 
admirabl e in the eyes of the co mmunity, that™s it. That™s it. And 
-- and for Stangl this was 
exactly it, I mean it was admi rable what he was doing. 
Q: So from what you tell me, I mean there is
 no sense of, you know, being when you -- you™re in 
a room with Stangl, of being in 
the presence of evil. You™re in a 
room with a provincial Austrian 
policeman who got lucky, or what? 
A: No, you™re in the room with a -- it™s not -- 
that ™s too simple, reall
y. And you™re just saying 
this to draw me  out, I know. But of c ourse it
™s too simple. You can never simplify some body like 
Stangl, you can say -- I can say here is just a 
provincial Austrian. Of course he was just a 
convincial -- provincial Austrian. But he was a pr
ovincial Austrian who we
nt through a series of 
experiences which burned itself into
 his spirit, and corrupted him to
tally. He was a totally corrupt  
ma n. A ma n who should never have been allowed ag
ain into the presence 
of children. Which is 
what his wife felt, eventually, you know?  I mean
 -- and -- and I™m not even saying that -- you 
know, I™m not even saying that you can blame onl
y Stangl for this. You have to blame -- you 
have to blame the whol e -- the circumstances, and the environment. So 
the people who created 
this environment, are of course as blame wort
hy as Stangl. Do you see what I mean?  I mean, of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
59 
 
 
course Stangl, had he had the right help from hi
s wife, he could have got out of it. But it would 
have been difficult, and dema nded, you know, charac
ter. I me an, the kind of character he didn™t 
have. I mean the kind of civic courage that he di
dn™t have, and also some conviction of sorts that 
he didn™t have. For instance, the conviction that
 no one person, because he  was Jewish, is bad, 
rather than another person is good. 
I mean, it -- it simply -- thi -- th
i -- this is -- th
e moment this 
division exists in the person, 
where to him, you know, where a Russian is bad, and an 
Englishman is good -- I mean, this
 is total bullshit of course,total nonsense. And the mome nt 

you feel anything like that, wh
ich is one of the dangers of war by the way, you™re lost. 
Q: What was the experience like for you?  Apart --
 you™ve said that it wa
s fascinating, but when 
you open that door every morning, okay you™re fa
scinated, and you want to know, and you™re 
getting somewhere, and -- 

A: No, but it™s not okay you™re fascinated. I mean
 the fascination is -- 
you know, the intellectual 
challenge is tremendous. I mean, it™s a treme
ndous -- I mean it™s lik
e -- it™s like alcohol. 
Q: Mm. 

A: You know, it™s a tremendous thing, in which -- wh
ich is -- which was one thing with Stangl 
where I was -- where I was -- the one thing I wa
s worried about, about myself with these 
conversations with Stangl, is that I was consta
ntly the superior. This is very dangerous for 

anyone™s character. It™s very
 bad for you. And I was lucky enough that, you know, I had this 
wonderful family at home. I had the counterwei
ght of my e xtremely intelligent husband, and you 
know, very intelligent children. So not -- I™m sa
ying intelligent because you know, you feel that 
you are so much in command, that your brain is 
more in your mi nd than anything else. I me an, 
there were mome nts when I -- I -- I knew I coul
dn™t go on, and I then could go on, because that™s 
what I did. But -- but it was very
 different, of course, when I undertook this thing wi th sha -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
60 
 
 
with Speer. Because Speer was not just my equal, 
but he was way superior  to me  in intellect. He 
was far more cultivé than -- than I was at the 
time, you know. He had read far more. He -- he -- 
he was a -- an absolutely extraordinary ma n, and so
 it -- it was a completely different challenge. 
Q: Tell me  a little about it
. Let™s move on to Speer. 
A: We ll, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn™t like when 
he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me  to do this. I 
mean, he got in touch with me  having read, ﬁInt
o That Darkness.ﬂ And obviously -- I mean, as I 
said before, these people want to speak, they wa
nt to talk. And Speer re
ad, ﬁInto That Darkness,ﬂ 
which kept him sleepless, he said, for several 
nights. And -- and he decided that this wa s 
some body he could talk to. Now Speer had talked 
to a lot of people, you know, because he was, 
of course, a huge personality, of enormous i mpo
rtance historically. And I suppose every ma jor 
journalist in the world --  certainly in the wester
n world, tried to talk to
 Speer. I mean, it would 
have been insane not to. I didn™
t like him. I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I 
read his books. I thought he was an arrogant ma
n. His charm did not char
m me . I thought his -- 
he was very suave, and I couldn™t bear it. So wh
en he -- when he wrote to me , and then followed 
this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- 
I was very reluctant indeed. He became -- he 
became very atta -- not attached, that™s the 
wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very 
much, already on the telephone. I mean, they had 
these long conversations on art, about which 
Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, 
of course. But also, Don knows far more than I, 
but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- 
and it was quite intere
sting for my husband, you 
know, who was still very activel
y on ﬁVogue,ﬂ and doing lots of
 photography, also to do with 
artists and so on. So it was al
l very interesting for him.  
Q: Mm. 

A: And he -- he didn™t like Sp
eer very much, any more than I 
did, but -- on the phone, I me an.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483  
61 
 
 
Q: Mm. 
A: But some how a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, 

some thing -- I don™t know how ma
ny weeks it was, it was severa
l weeks of these phone calls 
which came in from Speer, all aski ng me, well wh
en would I come  to Heidelberg, and I mean 
wasn™t I planning?  I was so often in Germany, wa
sn™t I -- blah, blah, bl
ah, blah. And finally I 
thought, what is the ma tter with me ?  I mean, if th
 -- this ma n is so desperate for me  to do a 
Stangl on him, okay. I™ll do it. You know, as vulgarl
y as that, I thought. And 
of course that kind 
of thought immediately disa
ppeared the mo me nt I me t hi m. I™ve got to say, I mean really. I 
mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with 
him and his wife in a He
idelberg [indecipherable], 
and there was this humble ma n. On the telephone he 
was just as arrogant as on TV. So every tra -
- telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, 
some of them there was this curious humility. 
Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there wa
s a different man. And I thought, well wait a 
mi nute, maybe I™m all wrong about this. What 
is this ma n, you know?  Wh at is this? And of 
course, he talked a lot during a 
long, long lunch. And talked a lot a
bout it, about Hitler, which is 
what I encouraged him to do. And by the end of th
e lunch, and Don and I went back to our hotel, 
I said, ﬁJesus, of course the one thing that in 
all these weeks I didn™t th
ink about, was that this 
ma n was the closest to Hitler of
 anyone in Germany. Am I crazy not to want to talk to him? ﬂ 
Don said, ﬁOh yes, you™re crazy.ﬂ So -- so 
anyway, that™s how it started, you know, and of 
course the mome nt I started talking to him, I -- 
one™s attitude changes. Once -- as I told you, once 
-- once people start talki
ng about their childhood, and with me 
they always have to talk about 
their childhood first, because I think everything 
starts in childhood. I know 
that this is a -- a 
cliché thing to say, and Fr eudian 
and all the rest of it, but it™s 
not Freudian, it™s -- it™s purely 
huma n. It doesn™t apply to everybody either, I 
have to say. Because you can have a rotten 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

childhood, or a difficult childhood, and still become
 a perfectly ordinary and good person. So it 
doesn™t apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a 
terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, 
you can find connections. And certainly with 
Speer there were very, very str
ong connections. He was extraordin
ary lonely as a child. I me an, 
the mi ddle child of three, and neither liked by hi
s father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at 

the other -- one each, you know, of t he other 
brothers. He was very
 alone throughout his 
childhood. And -- and -- an-and really suffered under 
it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he 
had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd. So wh
en he found Hitler, of course it must have 
been the most extraordinary experience. And wh
en Hitler found Speer it must have been the 

extraordinary experience, because
, you know, if you want to ma ke it very simple -- and why not 
ma ke it simple, then a ma n who ha d never been
 a father, found a son. And a son who had never 
had a father, found a father. It™s as simple as that
, really, except it™s much more complicated. But 
start with the simple things, and you find answers.
 Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each 
other. They loved each ot her. And it took Speer
 -- it took Speer all those years to understand, 
partly, that there was some thing terribly wrong. 
And he never, never understood it really, until he 
was in Spandau, and was alone, and could re
ad. You know, he read 5,000 books in Spandau. 
And boy, he could read, you know. And he c -- he 
-- by the time  I me t him, he knew -- boy, he 
knew more than anybody else did. He really did. 
I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of 
course, knew more about Hitler than everybody
 else did, but he understood more than anybody 
else did. And as for this one part of this N
azism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you 
know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer
 was never an ideological anti-Semite. He wa s 
an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites.
 But he was not an ideological anti-Semite. He 
could ma nage with anybody, actually. And he coul
d ma nage, of course after -- I me an, after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

Spandau, I mean my God, I mean in Spandau he -- 
you know, in Spandau he had a -- a great deal 
to do with -- with Jewish officers, and actually 
had -- I mean, he even emotionally changed a lot 
there. You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous 
opening of understanding of what people were, 
you know. People, that it™s not -- it
™s not where they come  from, it 
-- but what they are. Which is 
the only thing that coun
ts. I mean, it doesn™t matter where an
ybody come s from, what religion, or 
what they like to call race. I mean, this ridi culo
us and dreadful word, race. It™s -- it™s totally 
unimportant, the only thing that ma tters is what 
the indivi dual is, with a capital I. And that™s 
what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in
 Spandau. So you know by the time -- by the time  

he came to me , I mean he was really preconditioned 
to really talking. And he did, I mean he -- he 
-- Speer t-taught me  mor e  than I 
could ever give him. He would 
have hated this book, of course, 
absolutely hated it. He was very, you know, he wa
s very, very dubious about what I would write. 
And he was so right.

Q: This is tape number three, side B of an in
terview with Gitta Sereny. 
[tape pause] -- dubious or 
not, he talked to you anyway. 

A: Yes, he -- b-because once, you 
see that that™s -- that
 of course is -- I m
ean, it™s the secret, you 
know, I mean what have I been doing for the la
st three hours -- you know, three and a half hours, 
when I really told myself, and told Don, three ho
urs is it, no more. And -- and I have talked to 
you. When people start to talk, they
 talk, because the point is that
 -- and this applies to almost 
everybody, as you have found, too, I™m quite sure in 
your professional life. But people like Speer 
-- and I won™t say people like I,
 because I don™t mean to compar
e myse lf to Speer, but -- but -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

but people of some , if you like, some  intellect, 
or some  -- they are not protected by this. They 
need it just as much, or it happens just as muc
h. And certainly Speer -- I mean there were days 
when he -- when he obviously had had some  expe
rience with jailers, or
 whatever, I don™t know, 
when he -- when it was really very difficult 
to get him to go on. But on the whole, he was 
completely different, of course, from Stangl,I mean obviously. But he was looking forward to 
these conversations. 

Q: How tortured was he emotionally by the pr
ocess you put him through, and the process he put 
himself through in Spandau? 

A: He was -- Speer was -- I tell you Speer wa
s more tortured by guilt than anybody I™ve ever 
met. He felt guilty for every Jewish death. Every 
one of the six million. And he never said that, 
but I know this, I know this. He was desperate about it. The only mi stake was -- and I could 

never, never -- I could never persuade him of this, 
that he too felt that  th
at was the only thing he 
needed to feel guilty about. And when I said to
 him, and I did of course, not once, but oh, how 
ma ny ti me s, you brought the forced laborers to Ge
rmany, you are responsible for the death of a 
hundred thousand of them. This was your work, 
not Sowers, who was hanged for it. He was 
under your orders, it was yours. It 
simply didn™t touch him, it was like -- as if I didn™t say 
anything. I mi ght as well have kept
 my mouth shut. He felt no guilt fo
r this. This was part of his -
- I won™t call it duty, but it was -- it was simply pa
rt of what he was there for. And as far as he 
was concerned, of course -- and this is true, I m
ean, of course I checked 
all this. When he found 
out that foreign laborers -- I mean, fo -- he ca
lled them Gastarbeiter, but hell, they weren™t 
Gastarbeiter. When fo -- foreign laborers were
 mi streated anywhere, if he found out, he took 
measures. He did. And -- and you know, he me n
tioned a number of occasions to me . Every 
occasion that I coul d look into, I di d. Every sing
le one of them was confi r me d. He took steps, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0483

was changed, the people were proper
ly treated, they were moved into
 different places where they 
were properly treat -- or whatev
er. So, he did. Even so, the system, it is the system, and he 
agreed to the system, and he supported it, and he was Hitler™s closest friend, and he was 

responsible for God™s sake. He was responsible, he
 was responsible for their deaths. But he knew 
it, you see, and he was -- he 
was the unhappiest man of
 all the Nazis I me t. He was the most 
important, and he was the unhappiest.
