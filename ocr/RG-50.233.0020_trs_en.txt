13,000, 14,000 and over 10,000, 11,000 were Jews.  The ma jority of the town 

 
2
were Jews.  So life was --  the anti-Semitis
m came in later -- but most of the time 
we had a mu ch easier time because most of the population were Jewish.  The 
professionals were almost 90% Jews -- 
the doctor s, the lawyers and the same

and the carpent ers, the tailors were all Œ 
most of them Jews.

A: It was not, well, the relation was pretty
 good.  It wasn™t -- it was all right.  But 
then in the later years, in 1939, ™38, 39, anti
-Semitism started.  We had a very like 
organized anti-Semitism was comi ng.  Partially was comi ng from the church and 

partially was comi ng from foreigners when 
they came in to build the dam.  What 
a dam!   Poles from differ e nt parts of th
e country came  into our town and they -- 
was like organized anti-Semitism.  So life was getting much harder but we still 

had the power.  We  were strength -- our st
rength was the majority and this is the 
way we kept our strength.  We  were
 pretty safe yet at that time.

5
A: (Anti-Semi tes). 
 

Q: Were these Poles that lived in your town or ---? 

 

A: We don™t know, we don™t know.  Probably 
this was already from the Poles from 
the town because it was only done by young hoods.  Then already you could find

et on the side street and they were 
beating him up.  This already happened a

that was _______.

of politics when we were  -- when we 
used to get together on the evenings and our
 leader used to talk
 about it.  Mainly 
especially about the ways to explore th
e situation, what™s happening in Poland.  
At the same time to be more, true Zionist.
  They used to bring out the evenings, 
what happening, not only in Slonim, the same  thing is happening all over Poland.  
How anti-Semitism was getting stronger 
and starting to fl ourish.  We  were 
worried that the work, that 
business, I mean already we

u __________ﬂDon™t buy from the Jews™}.  
Don™t buy from the Jews and then they 
start already organizing Polish stores 
where they didn™t have any be
fore.  Or we had very few before.  They had like a 
cooperative stores open up.  To
 tell in the church, they used to tell the Poles and 
the farmers and the White Russians because it was an area where the Wh ite 
Russians stood, to tell them not to 
go to shop in the Jewish stores.

Q: Were you concerned about the events that
 were in Germany too?   Did that enter 
into your --? 
 

A: Yes, we were, because we  used to have
 already pe ople from --.  Already we had 
refugees fr om Germany.  They came in
to Poland when Hitler came to power in 
1937, ™36. ™37.  The German Jews, s o me  of the m, ran away and some  of them 

ma ybe had Polish citizenship, so they sent
 them back to Poland and we heard all 
these stories what™s happening.  At c
hurch they speak, the newspapers _______. 
 

Q: So you were very aware? 

 

A: Oh yes, we were very aware. 
 
Q: Were these discussions, did they ca

A: Yes, yes. I used to talk with them inthe house, discuss in house.  My parents were 
born in Slonim.  They lived 
all their lives and their pa
rents, their grandparents, 
lived all the time in Poland.  There was no wa
y to emigrate to any other place.  To 
Israel, it was impossible to emigrate . {To Palestine}.  To Palestine. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: To America, they did not consider.  Of course, we had a well-established  
business.  We lived in a town where mostly Jews so they didn™t suffer 

enough.________. 
 

Q: Tell me  about the war when it broke 
out.  Do you reme mber exactly what was 
happening? 
 

A: Yes, one day when it broke out the war,
 so planes already start flying over the 
city.  Then immediately we
 organize like a self-defen
se but I know the self-

 
7
defense was to build bomb shelters.  I 
volunteered, my father and we were 
building bomb shelters in a little park in front of the house 
 
Q: What did you build them out of? 

 

A: We built just  a -- like dig ditches.  Just 
to be able to -- if a bo mb falls, it wouldn™t 
hurt you because you™re in a ditch.  If an
 explosion would come , it would fall 
ma ybe a fe w me ters away. you  wouldn™t 
get hurt.  But who knows, that™s a 
chance, that™s what we were doing. 
 

Q: So you were doing this after the planes flew over Poland? 

 

A: Yes.  Imme diately when the war broke 
out.  Lisa, you can come
 in, say whatever -
- .  {We also had to Œ in all towns. 
 It was__________, to put strips on the glass} 
Oh, yeah strips on the glass.  {On the 
glass from shattering, you know.  In case it 
shatters in the bombing}.  So everybody put 
some  paper in zigzag.  {X™s like}  X 
on the glass in case a bomb fa
lls, the glass won™t shatter. 
 

Q: Do you remember what it was like when the planes were flying overhead? 

 

A: We were very scared, very worried.  
It was very frighteni
ng.  We never seen 
anything like this before.  It was the firs
t experience we ever had with planes; we 
didn™t have too ma ny planes flying over 
Slonim before.  We had a small little 
airport not fa r away but very seldom you 
could see planes flying there.  German 
planes were coning through, comi ng that si
de, the confusion on the streets, panic 
on the street.  Especially Jews were ve
ry, very concerned.  Because in our mi nd, 
we knew that Poland is not going to be 
able to survive agai nst the Germans. 
 

Q: What happened in those following days? 

 

A: What happened in those following days 
--When did the Russians come ?   How far 
was it before --.  I know September 21
st

broke out September 1
st
}. 
 

Q: September1

A: September1
st
; a fe w days later the Russians ca me
 in.  They occupied our town.  
The excitement was ---Can you hold on? 
 

Q: I™m going to pause the recorder. 

 

A: I™m through.  I knew I™m going 
to expect a te
lephone call. 
 

Q: Okay.  Let™s talk a little about the Ru
ssian invasion.  Tell me  what that was like. 
 

 
8
A: All right.  The Russians invasion, we we
re terribly excited.  We were very, very 
excited and happy that at least the Russi
ans are here so the Germans are not -- 
won™t invade our town.  On the way in, a
nother incident is, I jumped out when the 
first tanks came  in.  The Russians invited 
us to come  in on top of the tank.  I was 
very excited because they picked me  up and I, with another few friends of mi ne, 
we drove in.  It was almost a little bit not
 the outskirts, it was a part of the town.  

We drove in with him to the mi ddle of -- 
to the center of th
e city on the tank.  
They took us on top of it and we were overjoyed, very excited. 
 

Q: People came out to greet the tanks? 

 

A: Yes, everybody came out, especially Jews
.  All the Jews came out, with tanks, the 
Russians.  At that time they were very frie
ndly to us and they told us not to worry.  
The front line is already far ahead and in fact they didn™t fight because it was--

they ma de out a deal with the Germans.  They would cover one part of Poland and 

the Germans would take another part.  Th
ere were no battles at that time, very 
exciting times. 
 

Q: After that, did your scho
ol continue as usual? 
 

A: Yes.  Then I enroll
ed in a technical school. 
 

Q: Was this a Soviet school? 

 

A: A Soviet school, a Soviet technical sc
hool and I knew that my  time for going to 
Palestine was almost over but I didn™t.  I 
took my chances I went from Slonim.  I 
went to Vilna on a train with the 
underground from Hashome r  Hatzair. 
 

Q: Now you we re trying to go to
 Israel, to Palestine now? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What date was this? 

 

A: That was 19____, I don™t know exactly.  I can figure out, well it could be in the 
forties, 1940, early 1940.  I went with a fr
iend of mi ne.  We were sent to Vilna, 
ma ke some  connections with the_______. 
 

Q: How ma ny people? 

 

A: I went with 21.  But I run out of_______, 15 or 20 fellows. 

 

Q: You were all planning to emigrate? 

 

A: We were all planning, yes.  So we st
art to still work lik
e a little underground 
organization.  Underground, we™re still ta
lking about going to Palestine.  So I 

 
9
went to Vilna.  I was in Vilna for about
 two days and then the leadership over 
there decided that they
 still need us in the occupied territory.  I should return to 
Slonim and work with the underground so I 
followed that.  I start going back, they 
left us on the border. 
 

Q: On the border? 

 

A: On the border between Lithuania and White
 Russia.  Then after they arrested me , 
then I went back to Slonim. 
 

Q: Who arrested you? 

 

A: TheRussians. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

A: Well, they thought ---, I don™t know, they 
suspect me  as a spy.  But they couldn™t 
get anything and there wasn™t any spy so th
ey after two days, they released us and 
we went back to Slonim.  In Slonim back, 
I enrolled to techni
cal school and after I 
finished technical school, we
nt by a year.  After the year they sent me  out to pay 
back.  So it was -- my job was to show who is, in the small towns.  They gave me  

a truck with a projector with some  el
ectricity because they didn™t have any 
electricity in the farms or small towns.  That was my job. 
 

Q: Was this around Slonim still? 

 
A: It was approximately, was real -
--.  First I was in_______and_______ Was not far 
from Sloni m.  I worked over there until they________. 
 
Q: Did you continue our activities with
 the underground while you were in the 
technical school and while you were working? 
 

A: Yes, while I was in th
e technical sc
hool, yes. 
 

Q: What kind of things did you do? 

 

A: We were talking with each other, we
 didn™t do any sabotage but we were just 
dreaming and talking that one day, maybe
, we™ll find a way how we can, we can 

find a way to go to Palestine. I didn™t 
know if I waited some  directions, some body 
would come  from some place.  Could be 
from Poland, could be from Lithuania, 
could be from Russia because a lot of Jews ran away to Russia.  It was an 

underground from Russia to Palestine.  
Going out, we didn™t know, but it was.  
We me t some friends what they had 
the underground deep in Russia not far 
from___.  {Black Sea and then they went 
by way of Roma ni a to Palestine}.  It 
was the underground.  
 

 
10
Q: So you were hoping that you woul
d be contacted to do the same? 
 
A: Yes, we were hoping that we will becontacted because we could not ma ke any 
other contacts.  We  were waiting that 
ma ybe someday we will be contacted. 
 

Q: Tell me  about when the war broke out again. 

 

A: The war broke out again ---.  Now you™re talking about 1941. 

 

Q: WhenGer many___?  

 

A: Germany,Russia. 

 

Q: Or do you want to say anything abou
t ma ybe when you were working in the 
towns or ____? 
 

A: Well, I was --.  We ll, I had one incident
 when I was working in the towns.  This 
would take too long, it™s not
 so terribly important. 
 

Q: Okay.  Whe r e was your fa mily during 
all this?   Were they still in Slonim? 
 

A: My fa mily was still in Slonim;  they 
got jobs.  My father could no get a job 
because he was a businessman; he was stamped a businessman. {It was an 

undesirable_____}.  Undesirable so he got a pl
ace to protect it; 
he got a job as a 
watchman at night.  Watchman in a little factor y or whatever  it was. 
 
Q: So your fa mily™s standard of living was reduced? 
 

A: Standard of living was completely re
duced.  The only thing is we™re still had 
me rchandise but we hide it when the Russi
ans came  in.  We  hide like yard goods, 
so we still ha d some thing all the time to tr
ade and still live a be
tter life than {the 
average person under Russian occupation, they didn™t have it}. We still had 

some thing left plus they were pretty we
ll off before so we still had some  money 
and some  jewelry. 
 

Q: Did you see your fa mily often while you were working? 

 

A: While I was working, yes.  I used to co
me  in, not so often, but quite a few times I 
came home.  In fact, maybe I should tell you 
this fi rst.  I had one incident, like I 
say before.  I had my own equipment to show
 the movies; I had a 
generator.  I left 
the generator in a school and locked up 
the school.  Some body broke into the 
school and they stole the generator.  In
 the time  when I went, I didn™t let him 
know, the weekend, I went to see my fa mil
y, I went to Slonim.  Ca me  back and 
the generator was stolen.  Now the main
 problem with stol
en generator, you 
cannot replace it.  You cannot go out and buy another one.  [_______You can™t 

 
11
replace anything}.  Cannot repl ace it.  So th
e only thing I was awaiting is jail for 
negligence.  The war broke out 
otherwise I would be in jail. 
 
Q: It happened within weeks after --? 

 

A: It happened in weeks before the war 
broke out.  A few weeks before the war 
broke out.  So almost the war saved me  fr
om goi ng to jail.  The war broke out; the 
night when the war broke out, I was on a da
te with a beautiful girl.  At twelve 
o™clock, after mi dnight, I hear
d the artillery and the war star ted.  I immediately 

after the date, I came home and even here
, the shooting, the sh
elling was getting 
much heavier and I immediately packed my little knapsack and I star t walking 

home  with it. 
 

Q: Walkinghome?  

 

A: Walking.  Only by foot, I could not go a
ny other way.  On the way a lot of things 
happened. 
 

Q: You were walking from Grodno? 

 

A: No from Oft r yn.  It™s a small town where I worked. 

 

Q: Can you spell that? 

 

A: O-f-t-r-y-n.  I™ll try to find out ma ybe  
exactly. {yeah, that™s the way you spell it}.  
So immediately I start going to the dir
ection to see my fa mily.  I go back to 
Slonim.  On the way already, the German
s were bombing the roads; the Russians 
were flying in trucks.  The ones that we
re going were bombe d.  The villages were 
burning and the roads were cl
ogged up.  What mo re inci
dent is that the Germans 
came with planes and start bombing the place where I was walking.  It was a 

dogfight, the Russian planes came right to 
the place where the p
ilot parachuted.  I 
was there when the Russians the ones that 
were walking too, were on foot.  Four 
Russian soldiers were on foot running b
ack to Russia, the border.  I was there 

when they shoot the pilot. 
 

Q: The German  pilot? 

 

A: The German pilot.  It happened that th
ey walk away and I went after and got his 
gun.  I took his gun, hid his gun and I walked 
to my house, back to Slonim.  On 

the way, all the villages were burning and it 
was safe to come  home .  In fact, it 
happened on the road.  Until I came to Slonim.  Slonim was already occupi ed by 

the Germans so imme dia t ely right before 
I came to the city, I threw away my gun, 
was a pistol .  They arrested me and they ---.  Ever y male in Slonim they arrest ed. 
 

Q: Jewishmale? 

 

 
12
A: No, every male. 
 

Q: Every ma le, period? 

 

A: Every male.  Mainly they were l
ooking for ---.  I was lucky that my______ 
particularly, wasn™t that impor
tant.  I had my hair, now I™m ba ld headed but at that 
time I had hair.  {A lot of it}.  A lot of it and hair was very important.  Because 

anybody who was a soldier, who was in the 
army, had a crew cut.  So they knew 
that I™m not a soldier.  Immediately they
 arrested me  and they put me  in a big 
yard, with the rest of Ru
ssian prisoners, a schoolyard. 
 Then after the next day, 
they announced that anybody who is younger than a certain age, 15, 16 years old 

and I looked young, could go home .  So I went.  I was one of them to be a 

youngster and to run home .  So they se
t up a place where you can run out and 
they were beating up each one as he wa
s passed by so they can have any place 
where they can hit.  But being a kid, they
 jumped over the gun what they had, the 
rifles and I got back to my house.  Wh
en I came to the house, it™s another story 
but an important story.  I came to the house.
  I didn™t see my family for maybe a 

couple of months.  It was, if I™m not mi st
aken a Friday night.  It was Friday.  I 
came in the house. It was not Friday.  They ma de  a real nice dinner for me , the 

ben yorkin.  If you notice, I have th

small little courtyard.  All of a sudden we 
could hear the shooting and the fighting 
that was going on and before we turn 
around, the house was a wooden house, the house was on fire.  We  grabbed 

shingles on top, we could have_____tracking 
the shingles.  So my father says, 
thank God, it™s raining.  It wasn™t rain
ing, it was striking on the shingles before 
we had a chance to put out th
e fire.  We  ran out the house,
 not to be burned -- we 
took the chance to run out in the mi ddleof the fight.  After we -- imme diately 

some were arrest ed by the Germans right 
there in the yard.  After the fi ght was 
over in the morning, they selected a
nybody who didn™t have any hair.  They 
thought --, well short haircut..

me  and my father, a few other me n, they 
ma de us to dig a ditch.  A big hole, a bi
g grave and they shoot the rest of the 
people, the Jews, a few Russians, they 
shoot everybody on the place.  They bury

Was it a small troop or --?

A: They were -- well I woul d call it arrested because they keep them in one place and 
they had a guard.  They didn™t take us to
 a building and arrest ed in some  place.  
They just put a guard against us. 
 

Q: They shot the Soviet soldiers and then

Q: So you didn™t have any of
 your clothes or anything? 
 
A: {Nothing, nothing.  They just ran out of 
the house}.  Just ran out, we didn™t have 
anything.  {As they were}.  The only thi
ng is what we had, we had some cloth 
what we buried in the ground to hide from
 the Russians.  This, we still have 
because it wa s hidden in the ground so we 
still have that.  The other encounter 
what I had was that they took out 1,500 me
n. It was my father
 and I was one of 
them.  They took us to the ma rketpl
ace surrounded by Germans all the wa y 

around and we didn™t know where they were
 taking us.  They told us they™re 
taking us for labor.  A few hours later, trucks were comi ng in through the 

courtyard and the same  thing happened in 
the courtyard because we had some  real 
important Jews from the community lead
ers.  The rabbi, the chassan and some  
other community leaders were there too

Meanwhile I could see that before I c
ould come  back, I could see already my 
father getting up to be taken away.  By th
at time , I didn™t go back to the front of 
the line.  I wa s standing all behind it.  
About three o™clock, exactly three o™clock 
the German high officer came and he said th
at anybody left here will be able to go 
home. 
 

Q: So you just kept standing in the back of the line? 

 

A: Yes.  The action was over.  They took 1,200 me n, 300 were left. I was one of the

 They recognized that the people 
were killed. 
 
Q: So they found out what happened? 

 

A: They found out what happened. 

 

Q: Let me make sure that this working well. 

 

A: Okay, the second time what happens to me
 I™ m going to skip it and I™m going to 
the part of the liquidation of Slonim.  
 

Q: Okay, just tell me  in a very broad outlin
e, the creation of the ghetto.  We  can just 
go in very quickly but I want
 to cover it a little bit. 
 

A: Then after they organized they told 
everybody, they gave them a certain part of 
the city wher e it was mo st of the time it 
was -----.  {In the be
ginning it wasn™t in 
the worst part of town and there were no 
barbed wire in the beginning }.  But they 
told us you cannot well, yeah, we™re going to
 skip it and go to the ghetto already.  
In the beginning, it was no ghetto and you 
could move around from one place to 
another till it happened™ till Novemb er 29, 
when was the action?   {First action in 

Slonim was on Nove mb er 14, 1941.  First big ma ss murder}.  But the ghetto was 

probably some ti me  in the late summer. 
 

Q: Of™42? 

 
A: {‚41}.  Forty-one. 
 

Q: So it was November 14, 1940? 

 

A: {Forty-one, the big ma ssacre in Sl
onim.  They killed 10,000 Je ws}.  We ™re 
talking now everything we ar
e talking is already ™41. 
 

Q: This is after the ghetto was created? 

 

A: Yes, well in 1941, in September when the Russians came in, that was -- no, no, 
the Germans took it over.  When was th
at?   {June, 1941}.  June, 1941 they took it 
out, the Germans ca me  i n.  But it was still free.  The Jews could still move 

around.  Then in the late summer, I don™
t remember when it was but maybe it 
looks like probably in Oc tober, {No, 
earlier than that because we were_______ 
already}. All right, so maybe in Septembe
r.  {In summer, no, earlier in August}. 
 

Q: August? 

 

A: {In August they cut off part of the 
neighborhood on the outskir
ts where the Jews 
lived because we lived on the outskirts 
of Slonim.  They moved everybody into 

 
17
the city.  We  had to abandon our place a
nd come in close into
 the city to the 
Jewish quarters}.  So the ghetto was in 
September, 1941?   {™41, yes, but it was no 
barbed wires at first.  It was an open ghe
tto they called it. All of us had to wear 
yellow patches, not Stars of David, but a 
round patch, a yellow one in front of the 
garment and in the back.  We  were rest
ricted to walk around in the neighborhoods 
where we were sent from, that were not
 part of the Jewish ghetto even though 
there was no barbed wires}. 
 

Q: But if you were found, you would be arrested? 

 

A: {If you were found, you would be punishe
d.  Then before the first action in 
Slonim, before the big ma ssacre, they ag
ain shrank the ghetto, the perime ter of the 
ghetto.  Again they ma de it smaller but it st
ill wa s not very sealed off.  Already 

they had barbed wire but loose}. But 
then we had the ghetto, we have four 
ghettos, divided by the river.  {The river flowed through the town}.  The river 

flowed through the town so the one with th
e larger ghetto and th
ree small ones; all 
divided by a bridge and the river.  So it 
was all four sides.  One side {from the 

other}.  Small ghettos but they were a
ll connected with a bridge.  The same 
bridge, the Poles used the same bridge.  
They had to pass by because it™s pa rt of 

the city. 
 

Q: Could you go freely among the 
different parts of the ghetto? 
 

A: Yes.  {Yes, until it was sealed.  At th
at time , that Aron is talking about, yes you 
could walk freely}.  You c
ould still walk freely. 
 
Q: This was still in 1941? 
 

A: {Forty-one}. 

 

Q: Then at the end of the year was this big massacre? 

 

A: Yes, the big ma ssacre came  in Nove mber 14, 1941. 

 

Q: It was hot that day, you say? 

 

A: Yeah, it was hot.  It was --. 
 That time they killed 10,000 Jews. 
 

Q: Just tell me  because I think I want to write about this stor y on the ID card.  It was 
already fall in terms of s easons
 or wa s it winter already. 
 

A: Yeah, it was already November 14
th
. 
 

Q: So it was much hotter than usual? 

 

A: Oh, Nove mber was already cold. 

 
18
 
Q: You said you went to get water because 
you were hot.  So you were just thirsty? 
 

A: No, no.  That was a different time, that 
wasn™t this time.  That time they only took 
1,500 me n.  That was --. 
 

Q: Oh, I™m sorry.  I was confused then. 
 Okay.  This happened maybe only a month 
after the occupation? 
 

A: The first one happened only a month after the occupation. 

 

Q: Okay, now it™s clear in my mi nd. 

 

A: The 1,500 happened a month after the occ
upation.  Then the other one happened 
on Nove mb er 14 and they killed -- that time  they took out 10,000Jews and they 

killed them from 8 o™clock till 5.  By ch
ance I found out some thing is going to 
happen the next day. 
 

Q: How did you find out? 

 

A: Next to our house a photographer lived. 
 The Germans used to come  to take 
pictures for their wives.  So they ma de
 friends with the photographer.  That was 
not Nazis, wa s the regular We hr macht.  Th
is was Wehr macht.  So he told him a 

secret that some thing is 
going to happen tomorrow.  The photographer told us 

some thing is going to happen.  Plus anot
her sign was that they gave special 
scheins to special tradesme n.  They gavespecial permits.  So that was a bad sign.  
All of a sudden they gave out special perm
its to tradesme n but we didn™t know it, 
was no experience.  We  had no experien
ce, we didn™t know anything that this 
kind of thing is going to happen.  But we
 were ready and worried why are they 
giving the _________ the different Jews, craftsmen, the scheins? 

 
Q: Theskilled?  

 

A: {The skilled, exactly}.  I imme diatel
y took my family, I was the head of the 
household, my father was kill
ed.  I took my fa mi ly, my 
mother and three sisters 
and we went out of the ghetto and we
 stayed overnight in an empty house. 
 

Q: How did you get out of the ghetto? 

 

A: At that time, wasn™t hard.  It was --
 the wires -- it was patrolled but it was 
{loosely}  Loosely.  It wasn™t so 
heavily guarded.  {Wasn™t sealed}. 
 

Q: So you escaped into an abandoned house? 

 

A: In an abandoned house and we stayed 
there a night and a whole day.  The next 
day we come back, half of the ghetto was 
taken out and killed.  The rest of the 

 
19
other half was back to normal.  They told them -- {10,000 Jews were killed}.  
You can fill in Lisa, you can f
ill me  in every ---.  {I was at the graves.  I wa s one 

of the people that came back from the 
massacre}.  Lisa came back from the 
ma ssacre but Lisa knows everything what 
I know.  {They were shot and I was 
there in the ditch}. 
 

Q: You were taken with your fa mily? 

 

A: No, I was hiding by a Christian woma n. 

 

Q: Oh, I reme mber now your story, yes. 

 

A: {She would keep us and --} 

 

Q: I reme mber now the story, yes. 

 

A: That was Lisa™s st ory.  Okay ---. 

 

Q: Soyou? `

Q: How do you spell that? 

 

A: {C-i-e-p-e-l-o-w-o}. 

 
Q: That was a forest? 
 

A: {Yes, a forest.  I imagine that the v
illage probably was cal
led Ciepelowo although 
this was the forest of Ciepelowo}.  But th
ey didn™t kill them in the forest, they 
killed them next to the forest.  {They kill
ed them in the ditches near the forest}.  
Right next to the forest.  In th
e forest you couldn™t dig any holes. 
 

Q; Did the Jews  in the ghetto know what happened? 

 

A: Yes, after.  {Yes, we knew because pe ople returned from the ditches.  After}. 

 

Q: People who hadn™t been killed? 

 

A: {Who hadn™t been killed.  But do you know wha t  happened?   They went in the 
hospital and the Nazis got to
 know that people survived 
and that they™re there in 
the hospital.  They came  at night 
and took them out to kill them}. 
 

Q: Thewounded? 

 

A: {The wounded}.  How much more time do we have? 

 
20
 
Q: I just, you know. We ™ll just 
get through the story, that™s

time.  If you want to --. 
 

A: Because we™ll have to leave by 5:30. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: We have a lot of _________.  {Car

A: Allright. 

 

Q: If that™s okay.  Afte
r the ma ssacre, your fa mily 
went back into the ghetto? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Were you working in the ghetto at that time ?  

 

A: Yes.  I got a job in the 
ghetto and I belonge
d to the -- imme diately joined -- we 
had the underground.  Jewish underground.  Pa
rt of them were my friends from 
the Hashomer Hatzair.  We organized 
and our purpose was -- we didn™t have a 
final purpose, resistance 
in the ghetto or ___________the forest.  I was part of 
them and another incident what happen
ed --.  {Carmit, after the 10,000, they 
shrank the ghetto again to ma ke it smaller}. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I worked in the b_________lager.  It wa
s a place where they™re accumulating --.  
The b__________lager was a big building and th
ey took Jews from the ghetto to 
assort arms where they found in the fi elds
 the Russians left.  
They were repairing 
the arms and assorting the arms. 
 

Q: So you learned how to do that? 

 

A: I worked there and the head, the fore
ma n was my  friend™s father.  He was the 
fore ma n.  We smuggled in, we sold the arms
 inside the ghetto.  It was the biggest 
job to bring in arms to the ghetto.  It
 was almost impossible because we were 
searched every time  we came in back 
to the ghetto, you were searched.  No 
question about it, if they find not only 
arms , they find food, they could get.  
Everything was in order, if anything 
was caught, everything was punishable by 
death.  We  took the chance to bring in arms.  How did we do it is our forema n got 

acquainted with the two Germans, the ones th
at were the heads of our departme nt.  
The two Germans, one his name  Wutz, one
 was name d Brown.  Brown and Wutz.  
They promised to start doing business with him.  What was the business? 

 
21
Bringing in some  valuables from the ghetto. 
 In return, he would give him soaps.  
Soap, I don™t know where the Germans got so mu ch soap but they had boxes of 
soap. It was wooden boxes packed with soap.  What we did is, we took out 

underneath, we took out part of the soap 
and we put in ammu nition and grenades, 
part of arms, pistols, whatever we co
uld find.  We  couldn™t 
find too ma ny pistols 
available, but just parts and we assembled 
them inside the ghetto.  What we  did is 
the forema n, you could not bring in the 
soap in the ghetto, how would you bring 
in the soap to the ghetto.  So the Germ
ans with the trucks when they took us 
home , he knew already the guards, the Germ
an guards at the entrance, they used 
to drive in with the truc
k in the ghetto.  {and unload}. 
 

Q: And he thought he was just giving you soap? 

 

A: Exactly.  He thought that some body was us
ing the soap for his business.  That™s 
the way we got arms.  We  were being or
ganized until there came an order that  we 

should go to the underground. 
 

Q: Whatdate? 

 

A: That was the summer -- Nove mber 14 
was the ghetto -- 
that was probably 
February of ™42, the beginning of ™42. 
 

Q: Who gave this order? 

 

A: I don™t know, the underground, I don™t know.  The underground worked very 
secret.  You don™t know who belongs to it.  You only know a few people around.

go out to work.  Nobody could go in or out of the ghetto.  {By this time , the 

ghetto was already sealed.  It was su
rrounded by barbed wires, tightly, with 
guards.  It wasn™t an open ghetto anym
ore}.  It™s no way you can get out.  {No 

way you can get out}.  No way you can get out of the ghetto.  In the same  

evening, this was on a Sunday, the special
 kommando where they came into town, 
they needed schnapps.  They needed liquor and rations, food.  So they came to my 

boss, the officer, his name  was Mr. Miller.  They came to Miller and they asked 

him that he should give them, should go a
nd give them ration of food.  He told 
them I cannot give you any food unless you gi
ve me  the eight Je
ws.  {You release 
the eight Jews from the ghetto that
 work in my p_________, I™ll give you the 
food.  Because the Germans were only supervisors; they di d the labor}.  We did 

the labor;  They didn™t even now how to fill an or der.   {They had to unload also; 

it all came in huge quantities}.  We  had to 
unload so he told them he is going to 
take care of this.  The next morning about
 six o™clock in the morning, the head of 
the kommando came into Miller, the captain
 of the German a nd they brought him 
a special permit to take out the ei ght Jews
.  He came to the gate and he told the 
German and the Jewish police to ask for 
Aron Dereczyaski and the rest of them.  
Come  out to the gate.  The Jewish poli
ceman came to my house; he knocked in 
the mi ddle of the morning.  By that time I want you to know that everybody was 

hiding in hi di ng places.  Already we ma de
 hiding places in getting ready when the 
action come s so we build a hiding place.  But I was still on the lookout and they 
came to my house and asked for me , Aron De
reczyaski.  They told him, he was 
smart enough, they told him that Mr. Miller
 was waiting at the gate.  I knew when 

he me ntioned the word Miller I knew that 
it™s legit, that I 
can come  out and see 
Mr. Miller.  The captain was telling me to
 get all the people together and in half 
an hour he™ll be back and we™ll go out to 
work.  All right, he gave us a________; 
he says don™t worry --.  {Nothing will happen to the Jews}.  Nothing will happen 

to the Jews They found the underground 
organization on the Polish side.  The 
Poles are organizing; they have an unde
rground organization so we are going, the 
Germans, he said ﬁweﬂ the Germans are co
mi ng to go into the ghetto to check if 
the Poles are not hiding in the ghetto.  That
 was the excuse.  That™s what they told 
me .  But surely enough, we didn™t believe 
it.  {Nobody believed it}.  I got all the 
people.  {that worked in different pl
aces} in the p_________.  We  got out five 
mi nutes to seven.  Seven o™clock, the acti
on started; we were
 only half a block 
away.  We  could see on the outside how 
all the Ge rman tanks and trucks and 
army and ammunition and machine guns 
are all pointing to the ghettos.  
Everything was at the end but we st
ill walked to the p________, to the pl ace 
where I was working.  A block or two bl
ocks away, we could hear already the 
shooting comi ng into the ghetto.  We  were just outside before.  I think we™re 

going to cut off here and 
I™ll finish the story --. 

 
24
 
Q: Okay. 

 

A: That time --. 

 

Q: And Lisa was not with you then? 

 

A: No.  {No, I was hiding}.  I came out a
nd I changed her into men™s clothes and I 
took her out.  {That was 
later, that was We dnesday, Thursday}.  Yeah, on the 
third day. 
 

Q: Okay, do you want to start from there when we speak again? 

 

A: Yes, we™ll start right there from the p_______. 

 

Q: Okay,right. 

 

A: When is the best time  for  --? 

 

Q: Let me  stop the tape. -------------No, okay.  

 

A: No.  Unless you think some thing over ther
e.   You want to clarify some thing.  
Miller took us out, took out 
eight of us and the mi nute ma ybe we start walking out 
of the ghetto, I want you to know that we
 are the only one 8 people what they 
took out from the ghetto before the action 
started.  The action started exactly at 
seven o™clock but this story happened wh
en they took us out, that happened 
before.  The mi nute we walked out of 
the ghetto we could see all the special 
groups are all surround the ghetto with mach
ine guns pointing at 
the ghetto like a 
real armed camp.  You could see that like,
 for me, it was cl ear that the ghetto is 
being liquidated and it looks like nobody is goi
ng to be able to survive.  Sure 
enough, they will not be able (?) to ge t out with life.  We  start walking and on the 

way we were stopped and checked our documents again.  The high officer 

stopped us and checked us -- our permit.  
He let us go and it happened that Miller 
knew all the big shots because they all used
 to come  to hi m for different kind of 
parties that they made.  Meanwhile all 
the big important Gestapo and Wehrmacht 
people was invited to his house. 
 

Q: Who is Mr. Miller?   Wa s he Jewish? 

 

A: No, no.  Miller was the --. 

 

Q: Was he just a local German? 

 

A: A Ger man, the head of the p________.  {He wasn™t a local, he was a 
Wehr macht}.  He was a We hr macht, a cap
tain.  He was a Wehrmacht captain.  

 
25
We went to the same  place where I wa
s working because there it was p________, 
that™s the name of it in German. 
 
Q: That was the warehouse? 

 

A: The warehouse where they used to give
 out the food.  We  stayed over there during 
the day.  You could hear and the shooti
ng, you could hear all day and they are 
taking out people.  I mean they™re shooti
ng in the place and we heard -- the other 
Germans we re telling us that they™re 
taking out Jews whom they can find.  
They™re putting on trucks and they™re taki
ng them out; outside th
e city, outside of 
town in the direction of 
Ciepelowo how-do-you-spell-it? 
 

Q: We spelled it yesterday. 

 

A: No, yesterday we had --. 
 No, Ciepelowo  {C-i-e}  We
 had a different place.  
{C_______ but you had Ciepelowo where th
ey killed the 1,200 me n}.  Oh, 
Ciepelowo we had Thursday. 
 

Q: Right.  So Ciepelowo was first when th
ey took out the me n and it was also here 
when they were liquidating the ghetto, is that the same  place? 
 

A: Well, the first time they take out ne
ar Ciepelowo, the 1,200 me n.  Then t he 10,000 
to Pietralowi cze.  
 

Q: How do you spell that? 

 
A: {P-i-e-t-r-a-l-o-w-i-c-z-e,Pietralowicze
}.  Now Pietralowicze that was on the --.  
{That was on the ____________}  That was on Nove mber 14
th
.  This time they 
took to Ciepelowo, in the direction of Ci
epelowo.  Now, in the place where I was 
working, you could see a small window in the warehouse, you could see a small 
little lake and past 
the lake you could see the hills of Ciepelowo where they were 
killing the Jews.  During the day, later 
in the day, you could already see that 
people were getting killed 
right there.  We  could see it through the window. 
 

Q: While this wa s happening, they were ma king you unload food? 

 

A: Yes, while this was happening, we we
re working regular on 
our job like every 
other day.  Now when i t  came at night, he 
did not send us back to the ghetto.  He 
let us stay in the p_______ in this place, to 
stay overnight .  We did not return after 

the first day to the ghetto, we stayed th
ere overnight.  The action was going on for 
three or four days in Slonim.  At th
at time, they killed 10,000 people or 9,000, 
9,000.  In the beginning they could not 
find anybody inside the ghetto because 
everybody was hiding so by the mi ddle of the 
first day, they put the ghetto on fire.  
They burned two or three ghe
ttos; it was four ghettos so
 two or three parts they 
put on fire.  It was a resistance in one 
ghetto, a small resistance when one Jewish 

fellow came  out.  He was a friend of mi ne and he came out with the hand 

 
26
grenades.  He  threw a hand grenade on th
e German truck and he killed some  
Germans.  The Germans got real ma d so they put the ghetto on fire.  This 
particular ghetto, that was 
the name  of the ghetto was Ja
pinka that was part of the 
Slonim ghettos, part of the four ghettos. 
 We were still si tting in the pl ace and 
working.  I mean in the same  place the p______.  On the third day, on a 

Wednesday, on We dnesday, on the third day, I 
asked that captain 
Mi ller to --.  I 
offered him --.  On Tuesday the next da
y I went to a bakery shop to get some  
bread what we used to do it every day.  Going to the bakery shop, we had to cross 

the ghetto because the one street the one we
 had to pass belonged to --.  That was 

the street that the Poles traveled on it a
nd the Jews walked on it when we could; 
when they took us for slave labor.  I 
went with the covered-up truck with a 
German, his  name  was Hans and I passed 
by the ghetto.  I could see the ghetto on 
fire; I could see people burning on fire, to
 the water because the little lake, the 
river was passing by.  People were burning th
eir clothes so they were jumping in 
the water of the ri ver. 
 

Q: Were they found by the Germans and then shot? 

 

A: The Germans were shooting at them.  
They were killed anyway.  The Germans 
were standing on the bridge and they
 saw anybody running in the water, they 
were shooting at them.  They were killed 
anyway.  Then we returned back to the 
p_______, the place of work.  This was the first day, the second day.  On the third 

day, I got an idea and I came  up to the capta
in and I tell him, Mr
. Miller, if you --.  
By that time , it quiet down already.  Th
e first day or the second day, they didn™t 
leave anybody to live.  A
nybody they found, they killed them on the place, they 
put them on the truck and they took him to 
Ciepelowo, to kill.  But they realized 
that ma ybe they should leave some  people 
arrest and take them some place so the 
other ones will st ar t comi ng out from the hidi ng places.  So the rumor came  out 
that anybody who come s out -- they a
nnounce on the loudspeakers that anybody 
going to come  out, they™re going to live.  
The action is over and this kind of 
stories.  It was getting a little bit more
 quiet in the ghetto.  Some  Jews ca me  out 
and they took them, arrested them an
d they took them over to the jail.  
 

Q: Theghettojail? 

 

A: No, not a ghetto jail.  Before the war was 
a regular jail.. So they took them back to 
the jail, to the yard by the jail.  They 
accumulated people over there and then they 
put them to the right and to the left.  
{They ma de a selecti
on, who™s going to live 
and who to die}.  They put them on trucks
 and sent them to be slaughtered.  A 
few of the m, the ones that would get speci
al permits, they let them out.  I could 
see -- by that time, Captain Miller came  
and he gave me  the special schein, a 
small little ticket about the size of --  ma
ybe 4 inches by 4 inches.  Maybe smaller 
3 inches, 3 or 4 inches with a stamp of the _______ commiss a r.  My number was, 

I don™t remember but I think it was 4 or 5. 
 He gave us all eight and we had the 
first numbers. 
 

 
27
Q: These were the special pe rmits which allowed you --? 
 

A: Which allowed us for now to live.  Th
at was only one document that we had, that 
we could show that we have a schein. 
 Then anybody what they had let out from 
the jail, was some body t he Germans recognized.  The Germa n came and took him 

out like a special carpenter, 
a special shoema ker.  One of the Gestapos some body 
recognized him, he took him out and he ga
ve him special schein.  By that time, 
they took us out and they gave us 100________. 
 By that time they gave us a new 

building where I ha d worked before the B_______ lager the pl ace where they 

were accumulating the arms, to sort the arms, the place where I have my job.  

They gave us over there two buildings a
nd anybody they gave the scheins, they 
sent him over there where they coul d sleep.  At the same time they told the 

Germans told us that we are not go
ing to sleep any more in the p_______ but 

we™ll be able to sleep in the new place. At the same time, I came to Miller and I 

told him, I say, if you can get me  a speci
al permit to go into the ghetto, I will get 
you anything what you want.  He was 
very much interested in gold and 
chandeliers and {silver,_______ whatever he 
can}.  Whatever I can to benefit him 
and then he could send it home .  He wasn
™t doing it from a good heart in the first 

place, he was doing it for what he would get paid. 
 

Q: Do you think he had a good heart in general? 

 

A: No, no.  He did only to us, only to take 
his eight Jews.  Otherw
ise he was a killer 
to some body else.  {In fact, I was told 
he was a killer in _________ in a different 
city}. 
 
Q: How was your relationship with 
him?   We re you afraid of him? 
 

A: Yes, I was afraid.  Yeah, but we had 
a relationship.  Hi m, by himself, I wasn™t 
afraid that he™s going to ta
ke the gun and kill me  even
 if he feels like I did 
some thing wrong with my job.  He wouldn™
t kill me , he would reprimand me  but 
he wouldn™t kill me.  We  had after working together, we had a relationship 

because we were good workers and he could depend on us.  At that time, he went 

to the _______commi ssa r and got the special 
permits to get into the ghetto and he 
gave me , four of us, permits for four  pe
ople.  My intention wa s if we™re going 

inside the ghetto and see if
 I can get in touch and can find my fa mily and see if I 
can find Lisa.  I knew approxima tely where 
they were hiding.  In my house, I 
helped build the hidi ng pl aces.  I knew in my house, 31 people were hidi ng under 

the floor that we dug out.  These 31 were hiding under the floor _______ so I 

knew because I was part of the people helping to build. 
 

Q: Lisa, were you also hiding in that house? 

 

A: {No}.  Lisa was hiding in --. {I was hidi
ng in a shed in the yard where the house 
that we lived}. 
 

 
28
 She was hiding in the shack.  When I got 
the permit for four of us I™m included, 
we went inside the ghetto.  I went to th
e place where I lived.  I found the people in 
hiding.  I could not take them out because I could not help them.  The onl y thing I 
helped them was to give them food, water. 
 I told them what th
e situation is and I 
could not take out my mother
 or sisters because the ot
her ones wouldn™t let me .  
Because that™s the only way they could have 
the contact is if my family is there.  
Because they know if I can help, I will take them out.  I will he lp them.  

everybody was looking for how they can save 
their own life so they would not let 
anybody take my fa mily.  I wanted to take 
one of my sisters. 
 I couldn™t take any 
more.  I left them there and I went on th
e way back to the gate.  I had to pass by 
Lisa™s house.  Lisa™s home  was only aboutfour or five home s away from mi ne.  

{Was kitty-cornered}.  On one side to the ot
her side --.  I came 
to Lisa™s pl ace, I 
looked in the place where they™re supposed to hide and the ma lina was opened.  

The Germans discovered the ma lina, they shot the people. 
 

(END OF SI DE B.  TAPE 1) 

 

Q: {Yes,S-c-h-e-i-n}. 

 

Q: And then Malina? 

 

A: {But you make sure that it 
is spelled right, the German}. 
 

Q: Okay, I™ll check it. 

 

A: Malina is the hiding 
pl ace.  M-a-l-i-n-a. 
 
Q: That™s in German or Polish? 

 

A: Well, uh --. 

 

Q: Yiddish? 

 

A: They called it that in the ghetto. 

 

Q: A ghetto term? 

 

A: A ghetto, __________. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: I™ll start a little 
bit before in case --. 
 

Q: So you were looki
ng at Lisa™s house? 
 

 
29
A: Malina where we were supposed to hide. 
 The place in Malina, the hiding place, 
was discovered where they took out the peopl
e.  I didn™t give up and I looked for 
Lisa a little bit longer.  I went to the b
ack, in the back was a small little yard, was 
a little shack.  I went to th
at shack and I start calling 
in Yiddish.  I say is anybody 
hiding?  {That™s Aron, that™s Aron, Li sa, 
are you hiding? }  Afte
r a short while, I 
was calling their name , Lisa heard my  
voice and she was there hiding with her 
father and little brother. 
 Before long, Lisa came down 
from the hiding place and I 
ma de an i mme diate decision that I™m going to take her out.  Now she™s a young 
girl, she was just 16.  She was sixteen y
ears old, ™42 Œ fifteen 
years old.  {I was 
15, 15 ½}.  Fifteen years old, very pretty,a good-looking girl.  I decided that I™m 

going to take her out.  So she parted with 
her father and brother.  I took her next 
door to a place, not where she lived but a 
cousin lived from where she lived, right 
next door to each other.  I took her with
 a little attic, I m
ean a little -- like a 
second floor.  I went down in the house 
and I found a pair of pants and a jacket 
and a scissor.  I looked all the way around. 
 I cut her hair, I put her boy™s clothes, 
men™s clothes and a cap and I made her 
look like a boy.  I took some  PX wires, 
electric wires and I covered all the wa y 
around her neck.  I did the same  thing to 
another fellow and we had a couple of chandeliers so she carried a chandelier on 

top of her shoulder and the other fellow. 
We  wer e  four, the other fellows helped 
me  do it by cooperating; I mean ge
tting the chandeliers, both of us. 
 

 

 

Q: Why did you take the wire? 

 

A: I found it, I pulled out some wires from
 the home because the home had a lot of 
wires.  They™re like extension wires; wa
s running all over the apartments because 

we didn™t have any electricity so they ma
de their own.  I mean we had electricity 
but wasn™t like here, was plenty wires.  
{The electrical wire
s were always on the 
outside in Europe in the old homes.  Y
ou didn™t have to go in the wall to pull 
them out, they were hanging}.  Hanging, 
so I pulled them out wires from the 
things and put them all the way around her neck.  The ma in thing is she carried 

the chandeliers so she put the chande liers --. 
 

Q: Why did you put the wires around her neck? 

 

A: Around the neck, you know like a loop.  You know like a big loop of wires, 
covered up fr om the neck, going down to the waist. 
 

Q: I see.  Okay. 

 

A: {Around my  neck sort of, I wound them around my neck and then they we re 
hanging}.  They were hanging loose and 
the ma in thing is I found a couple 
chandeliers where they kept them _________ 
so I took the chandeliers.  She was 
carrying the chandeliers;  then I gave her my
 schein, my permi t  to leave.  I gave it 
to her hoping and thinking in
 case if I™m caught without 
it that some way Miller 

 
30
will take my  up.  He will get me  out in case 
if I am arrested.  All five of us were 
walking through the gate.  I t
ook that white piece of pape
r what he gave me  with 
the special permit for four.  I came to th
e gate and the police were German guards 
were staying right by the exit of the ga
te and I™m already walking out.  {You 
waved it}.  I waved that piece of pape r; 
I says here™s my permit and here™s my 
four me n.  He didn™t check, he didn™t l
ook.  {He didn™t look at the permit}.  He 
didn™t look at the permit and he said for 
four me n and he let us through.  From 
there I went all the way to the prefanza, 
to my place of work.  By the way, comi ng 
through the ghetto, the German dropped us 
off, the same  guy that told us we 
would -- Fritz, it was Fritz, not Hans, it was 
Fritz.  Fritz dropped us off the first 
time to come in, in the ghetto.  Then wh
at we supposed to do is; Miller and the 
rest of the Ge rmans, they live across the st
reet from the gate, right across.  Al most 
a little kiddie car.  {They 
lived in a beautiful Jewish
 home, they requisitioned}.  
So they lived over there so my -- some one else, can you hold on a second?   Then 

we took the goods, whatever we were taki
ng with us, we took it there.  {For 
Miller, all the things we had some silver
 pieces and chandeliers.  We  found a 
watch here and there}.  Whatever, all 
the valuables what we took, I took across 
the street and left in Miller™s house.  Now we ca me  in Miller™s house, another 

problem.  How do I get Lisa to the work 
place, where I live.  I came to Miller, 
Miller was still home at that particul ar  tim
e, for lunch or whatever it was.  I came 
to Miller; I asked him, I told him that I 
found my s i ster; how can we save her?   So 
his answer was this place is not for 
hiding Jews.  {My place is not for hiding 
Jews, get her out of here imme diately}.  Im
me di ately.  I took her out and she went 
into the baseme nt.  He di dn™t follow or 
look for anything.  It 
was a basement and 
she was hiding in the baseme nt, in Miller™s
 baseme nt.  Over there, after a while, 
Miller left.  Another German was there.
  {Also there was a young Jewish boy.  I 
really wanted to insert this.  There 
wa s a young Jewish boy that was working for 
them like a mascot, polishing their boot
s and shoes and helping the cleaning 
woma n with chop the wood and everything. 
 He came down and he was sort of 
my protector.  He kept on telling me  notto worry, not to worr
y, that he™ll protect 
me , that he™ll do everything that is possi
ble.  He™ll never let the ma ids go down.  
He will always run to the baseme nt to br ing whatever is necessa ry}.  Now that™s a 

--. 
 

Q: How long were you in the baseme nt? 

 

A: In the basement, ma ybe a couple of 
hours.  {Couple of hours}.  Now come s the 
main story too.  I mean not the main st
ory but it™s an important story.  When 

Miller left , was another captain with him, 
by the name  Bauer.  Bauer is the name .  

{I think Bauer is spelled B-a-u-e-r}.  
Here was the only one German was here 
since the time of the war what I knew th
at he was righteous.  People always don™t 
want to hear this; we don™t like to tell 
the story.  I mean we don™t like to follow 
through but that™s what happe
ned.  {When we give testimony, we have to give it 
exactly the way it was}.  That™s right when
 we give testimony, we want to give it 
the way it wa s.  Bauer, after he left --
.  {After Miller le
ft, Aron approached 
Bauer}.  No, the night before.  When I 
was sleeping in the 
_______, I noticed that 

 
31
Bauer was talking to hims elf not far  fr
om me.  He was holding his hand on his 
head and he was saying, ‚I cannot believe 
it, how my people can do this kind of 
atrocities™.   He was almost cryi ng. 
 
Q: Tohims elf?  

 

A: Yeah, not that he ma de any comment to anybody.  But I noticed it.  {Aron 
overheard it, talking to hims
elf}.  I overheard it so when
 Miller  left , Bauer was in 
the house.  I walked up to Bauer and I told
 him, Captain, I say, I have my s i ster 
here.  Can you help me?  He said where is
 she?   I say in the baseme nt.  He came 
down with me  in the baseme nt and the first thing he says, don™t worry. 
 

L: {Well, when he came down to the basement, I thought he came down to kill me}. 

 

A: He walked down with me to the baseme
nt and he took a look at her.  She was 
sitting like a little, what do you call it?   
All curled up in a corner, hidden.  He 
takes a look at her and he says, she looks
 like a boy.  Are you a girl?   She says 
yes.  Do you have your clothes, your girl™s 
clothes?   She says ye
s.  He says, take 
off the me n™s clothes and get dressed like 
you™re being yourself.  Get back in your 
girl™s clothes and I™ll take  
you to the work place.  He said, you™ll walk with me  on 
the side walk because Jews were not allowe
d to walk on the sidewalk.  If there is 
any black crow, he called it.  {The Ukrainians that were poli
cing -- he called them 
the black crows}.  Anybody that st ops him, I™ll kill hi m on the place. Li sa left 

with him and --.  {I came with him to the ______.  Nobody stopped us,  Nobody 

dared to stop him.  He was a high-
ranking Wehrmacht man, a German a nd 
nobody stopped us}.  We ma de it through the _________back to the _________, 
to the workpl ace.  I was waiting over there 
already and I saw when Lisa ca me  so 
Miller, what™s-his-name, Bauer told us
 to go because Miller was in the work 
place.  So Ba uer told them to hide in Œ well it was like an open baseme nt under 
the warehouse.  He says you hide over th
ere.  He walked in and I saw Lisa 

comi ng.  After a little while, when Mille
r was busy in his office, and I found the 
right opportunity, I took 
her in, in the p_______, in the warehouse.  In the 

warehouse had thousands of sacks lined up.  It wa s sugar sacks, it was flour sacks, 

{flour, wheat, corn} all different kinds of 
sacks piled up in four or five high.  
Straight ened it out like by the Germans. 
 I imme diately ma de a hiding place, I 
took out two sacks and made a hiding place 
for Lisa wit the sacks.  She stayed 
there for the next night --. {They ma rked the sacks with a sign where to find me }  

where to find her {it was several blocks 
long this warehouse with all this flour in 
the sacks}.  Tell her what happened thr
ough the night.  {During the night I was 
practically devoured by rats}. 
 

Q: Gosh. 

 

A: So she went out from the  hiding place and 
she sit on top of the sacks.  {I hit them 
with all my strength.  I ha
d to raise the sack}.  Alrigh
t I™ll talk.  {See that time I 
was afraid that I was going to be devoured 
by the rats.  I sat on 
top of the rats.  I 

 
32
sat and I would run away as soon as the ra
ts would come .  Then when it start -- 
day came, I was afraid to sit there for so
me body to find me .  So I went back into 
the hole}.  The next day I got a permit for her, a special  schein fr om Miller.  I told 
her  --what-you-call -
-- and I took over to the place where everybody else.  I, in 
return, took another permit.  With the same
 per mit I went in next day; I took out 
two of my si sters and I br ought them to
 the _______lager.  I got to the new place 
where they living but I got special pe
rmit, two scheins for my  sisters. 
 

Q: Fromwho m? 

 

A: So the next day I took out two sisters. 

 

Q: Who did you get the permits from?   Bauer or Miller? 

 

A: Miller.  {By this time , why don™t you 
say by this time  --} by this time already 
anybody who {any Jew} any Jew who could al
ready get a --they let already {they 
decided to stop the massacre 
and let everybody come  out --} 
 

Q: Letpeoplework? 

 

A: {from the hiding places to shrink th
e ghetto and take them all at once}. 
 

Q: So then all the Jews that were left we re put to work? 

 

A: No.  {No, it was sort of like a stalemat
e}.  A stalemate.  Bu they gave in two 
ghettos.  One was in the building where I 
stayed and then they gave them in 
another little ghetto.  They ma de ever
ybody who survived, they ma de them you 
can leave and this because the psychol
ogy of the Germans always to shrink the 
ghetto.  Instead looking for ten or twenty 
blocks now they have only one building 
left over.  But they ma de other ghettos 
with another couple buildings.  The next 
time if they wanted to liquidate the ghetto
s they have only two s mall buildings or 
three buildings to go in there and arrest 
them and take them out and kill them.  

That was their way of -- {Carmit, for  refe
rence really.  Evidently we left  that 

summer but the ghetto was still left on 
for a while.  Some  people did go out to 
work.  You know that they had their speci
al shoema kers and the special tailors 

and whoever for a very short while}.  Bu
t we didn™t {we weren™t there already}.  
We weren™t there. 
 

Q: I™m wondering how you got the passes 
for your sisters and for Lisa exactly. 
 

A: I gave Miller a couple of gold coins. 

 

Q: Okay.  And the same  for Lisa? 

 

A: The same  for Lisa too.  
For money he would do it.  At that time  it was no problem 
already.  He wouldn™t give 
it out, I mean he wouldn™t help but for mone y he 

 
33
would give me  the schein because at that
 time it was easy already to get a schein.  
But I didn™t know and I was taking a chan
ce.  By the way we™re writing a book. 
 
Q: Good. 

 

A: Yeah, it should be ready probably ma ybe
 by the end of this year.  We ™ve been 
writing it for six years.  If you know, it™s qu
ite a bit stories what we™re telling you 
but a lot of them I skipped. 
 

Q: You™ll have to send a copy to our library. 

 

A: {Yes, we will}   Oh, yes.  }We should only live long enough to have it done}.  
Well, this year should be done, we™re worki
ng six years on it.  Mainly we want to 
have it like a teaching book too.  People 
read, they should know the killing, 

what™s his name  heard a lot of our 
stories.  L______.  You heard about 
L_______?   {He™s the head of the Righteous
 at Yad Vashem}  He™s the head of 
the Righteous.  He says, Aron, Lisa you are 
the Holocaust.  Diffe
rent aspects of -- 
it™s tremendous what the people lived thr
ough in camp.  Mos t  of 
it is the story of 
suffering but it™s terrible.  I mean it™s no 
-- we cannot ma ke it less but ours is like 

much more variety of different kind of stor
ies.  What happened in the ghetto.  All 
right and we survived there.  From there we
 left --. {Aron also did not tell you that 
he was able to take out his mo
ther and sister, baby sister}. 
 

Q: So you took out the rest of your fa mi ly? 

 

A: I took out the rest of the 
fa mily.  But my mother and sister, I took out from jail.  
They were arrested and I took them out 
from jail.  I took out, I saved all my 
fa mily by that time .  The n I ma de a 
contact through a friend, a White Russian 
woma n.  {A far mer woma n} A 
far mer woman what she took us with a horse and 
buggy from Slonim to Wishnoy R-o {The
re™s a _______on the o}  z-a-n-a. 
 

Q: This is the woman™s name? 

 

A: No, no.  This is the place, the name  of the town. 

 

Q: That she took you to? 

 

A: {Yes, and Rozana was already in the Third Reich}. And Rozana was 
approximately 20, 25 kilometers, maybe 
not putting any mileage, I don™t know 

exactly.  This woma n took us from Slonim, 
at night -- I met her outside of town -- 
and she took us to Rozana.  In Rozana,
 I was, agai n I™ll make it fast -- I was 
arrest ed there and the Polish police wh
at she knew, the local police, which 

probably was a ma de-up deal.  They came in in the morning and they took away 

everything from us but they didn™t arrest
 us.  The reason why probably they didn™t 
arrest us because if they would arrest 
us, we would tell them that some body took 
away all the valuables.  So this way they
 took away.  Away fr om there, in Rozana, 

 
34
I got in touch with the Jude
nrat.  The Judenrat gave us
 transportation to go to V---
---. 
 
Q: The Judenrat where? 

 

A: {InRozana} 

 

Q: InRozana? 

 

A: The Judenrat in Rozana helped us to 
get transportation t Zo
lkowyski. {Z-o-l-k-o-
w-y-s-k-i}. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: I went to _______to pick up transpor
tation to Zolkowyski.  We ca me  to 
Zolkowyski, we got in touch with imme diat
ely, the same  thing, with the Judenrat.  
The Judentrat found a place for us to stay. 
 It was a place a lot of survivors that 
came from different cities.  Because this
 was already -- [towns, towns} towns, 
because this was already the Third Reich. 
 But that time they were not killing 

anybody yet.  {It was summer of ‚42}  
Yeah, late summer of ™42.  This was 
already August, August of 1942.  Now that
 was my terrible decision that I can 

never forgive myself but  I couldn™t help
 it.  I had to ma ke up my mi nd which 
direction do I go.  I had a choice, to go
 from Zolkowyski or to Grodno or to 
Bialystok.  In Grodno I knew that
 Lisa went.  Lisa left by herself with her father 
and brother.  They left the place in Sloni
m a couple of days, ma ybe a week before 
I left.  I split up with Lisa because her 
father and brother survived too.  So she 
went -- she stayed with me  part of the tim
e but to leave Slonim, she left with her 
father and her brother.  
 

Q: ToBiaystok? 

 

A: {No, to Grodno} to Grodno.  I was left with my mother and the three sisters.  I 
took a different route with a different c
ontact too.  I found that woma n, the one 
who took us to Wi shnoy and to Zolkowyski
.  Wh en I came Zolkowyski, they told 
us you can go two ways where a big Jewi sh ghetto is.  One is in Grodno, one is 

Zolkowyski, {Bialystok} one is Bialystok. 
 So I had to ma ke up my decision.  So 
I ma de up that time  my decision that fo
r me  to survive, I can only survive {he 

realized at that time  that he could notsurvive with a fa mily}, as a family unit.  

The only way if I can survive for me  bei
ng involved with th
e underground, I left 
the underground because on account of the fa mily.  Being a young ma n, I had to 

ma ke the decision that if I have to go aw
ay to live, I am going to go.  I could only 
go to the underground if I can go by myse
lf.  I probably couldn™t help them 
anyway.  There was no way for me  to help them.  {Can you imagine having to 

ma ke that kind of decision? } 
 

Q: No. 

 
35
 
A: So I had to ma ke that decision and that 
was my worst decision in life -- because I 
never see them anymore.  They went to Bialystok and I went to Grodno. 
 

Q: Now, did you, did they wa
nt to go to Bialystok? 
 

A: Did they want to go to Bi alystok?   
It wouldn™t ma ke any difference for them.  
Yes, they had some  friend, some  fa mily 
were there in Bialystok, Grodno was real 
strange for them.  The only reason why 
I went to Grodno probably is ma ybe I™ll 
see Lisa there.  Otherwise 
I would go to Bialystok too. 
 

Q: So they all decided to go to Bialys
tok and then you said no, I™m going to Grodno? 
 

A: Yes.  I had to ma ke the decision that I™m going to get out and I™m going to go my 
way.  Otherwise, I would go to Bialystok t
oo.   On a beer truck, they took us to 
the Judenrat from Zolkowyski helped us
 to _____ to transportation to Grodno and 
I went to Grodno.  Being in Grodno I came to _______.  I™ll tell you the story in 

Grodno.  I arrived in Grodno, I found Lisa, I m
oved in in the same  place that they 
lived.  They had a little space in their r
oom with three or four other families.  

They ma de r oom for me ;  they put a ma ttress on the floor for me  to sleep too.  I 

stayed in Grodno and my only one purpos
e was, now when I™m in Grodno is how 
I can get in touch with the underground.  There was no other way for me  to 

survive.  Already my dec i sion was made
; the only way you can survive.  I had no 

doubt that liquidation is going to come  
to Gr_____too.  So the only way I was 
looking around is how I can find a contact
 with the underground.  I lived through 
all the time  in the Grodno ghetto.  I 
did not ma ke any contact with the 
underground.  You can imagine how hard it was for a young ma n having 
experience, belonging to the undergr
ound, looked around, being a stranger in a 

ghetto.  Because some  people were aski
ng questions, why didn™t other people go 
to the underground.  It™s very hard for me
 to explain them that here is a young 

ma n, has no attachme nts, no fa mily, trying 
to find a way how to go to the woods 

or to the underground.  I did not find duri
ng my time, I arrived in August of 1942.  
{Till Ma rch ‚43}.  ‚till March ™43, I coul
d not find any contact to go to the 

underground. {Shortly after we arrived, they 
sealed the ghetto and they started the 
transports to Auschwitz from Grodno}.  On
 Nove mber 1, the ghetto was sealed in 
Grodno, the ghetto was much tighter.  You 
had to have special permits to go 
outside from the ghetto even to work. 
 I went through all the time in _______ I 
went through all the liquid
ations of Grodno till the last liquidation.  {Tell them 
that you are under --}  We  were always 
under leave (? ).  {Besides, I think Aron 

should tell you that he wa s on his way to
 Auschwitz and he jumped out of a 
train}. That™s what I™m comi
ng, that™s what I™m comi ng. 
 So we left -- till the 
liquidation of the last, what do you call it 
the last liquidation?  {Ten thousand 
people they took out that time}. The la
st liquidation of Gr
odno, that was in 
February, February of 1942. 
 

Q: Forty-three,youmean? 

 
36
 
A: Forty-three, 1943.  By that time  I got ac
quainted with a Polish fellow.  His name  
is Tadek {(P- a-v-e-u-s-z  S-o-r-o-k-a}. 
 

Q: And Tadek was his nickname ?  

 

A: {Nickname , Tadek} Tadek was his nickna
me .  {T-a-d-e-k} I got acquainted with 
Tadek working outside the ghetto in rem
odeling a house for a Gestapo man.  So I 
was working over there with five other peopl
e.  I went out to work as a carpenter 
and being over there, who took me  in?  
a good friend of mi ne.  He was working 
there so he said Aron you could be a car
penter, why don™t you come  out to work 
in this pl ace.  He worked -- I worked 
with him and over there we got acquainted 
with the name  of this fellow Tadek.  Tade
k {bartered with him}.  Tadek bartered 

with us.  We  brought in some  different 
kind of watches from the ghetto and pants 

and some  other clothing what we could put
 on us and then take it off and barter 

with him.  {He would bring food}.  He gi
ve us food and we took it back to the 
ghetto.  One time he came in and he told us, he told to my friends, two of my 

other friends, he says, he 
don™t look Jewish, I can get you, I can take you to Vilna.  
{And give you Aryan papers so you can live 
on and try to survive as Christians}  

Try to survive as Christians.  My two 
friends accepted it and after a few days, 
they went to him, to Tadek.  Tadek supposed to send a note back.  {No, Hershel, 

one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived 

safely}.  So one of my friends was supposed
 to send it, they give us a note that 
they send with Tadek that they arrived safe
ly and they are safe.  Because at that 
time, you couldn™t trust anybody, you could tell 
the same  Polish fellow.  Any Pole 
could come  and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get 
paid for it.  The Germans would pay him fo
r it.  We didn™t know, we we ren™t sure 
what it is. But he came a couple of days later to the place where I was working 
and he says that Hershel and Ludnik (? ) th
at was their name s, 
they™re safe, they™re 
in Vilna and _______in the Vilna ghetto.  But he does not have a note.  The 

reason why he doesn™t have a note -- he sa
ys it start raining and he had to walk 

away, go away because the Germans are th
ere and he didn™t br ing a note.  {When 
the police wa s around the ghetto and he 
was worried, frightened}.  Worried, 
frightened and he didn™t bring us a note. 
 This wa y, he used to come  every other 
day back to our work and we did the sa
me  thing.  Bothering with him and one 
morning I didn™t know if I can believe him or not but one morning he came to us 

on the job where we were working.  He said I™m going to take you, I mean the 

ghetto is surrounded, the ghetto is being liq
uidated. I™m going to take you,  if you 
want it, don™t go back to the ghetto, I™ll take  you to Vilna.   By that time I had to 

ma ke the decision, should I take the chan
ce and go with him to Vilna or I mean, I 
wasn™t sure anyway but it still probably sa
fer than to go back to the ghetto.  The 
ghetto is being liquidated.  Anyway I ha
d to ma ke the decision.  I ma de the 
decision, I™m going back to the ghetto.  I did 
some  thinking after that.  I went back 
to the ghetto and Tadek gave me  his 
address.  He ma rked down on my body, 
spread out in different pl ace on my body. 
 I gave him my -- he gave me his 

address and any time I have a chance, if I survive or come  back to him, he™ll take 

 
37
me  to Vilna.  That™s the way we part
ed and I went back 
to the ghetto, comi ng 
back to the ghetto.  I was imme diately ar
rested.  Everybody who ca me  in back to 
the ghetto and they pushed us in a big synagogue.  In the synagogue during the 
day accumulated appr oximately maybe thre
e or four thousand people.  I don™t 
know how much the synagogue could take i
n.  We stayed there all day and all 
night, all evening.  It was probably about si
x, seven o™clock in the evening.  It was 
six o™clock in the evening; all night more
 people were already in.  The shul, the 
synagogue was already almost full from 
people comi ng from work arresting 
everybody.  They kept us there all day, all 
night.  I was looking for any place to 

hide.  I couldn™t find a hi ding place.  The 
next morning, about five o™clock in the 
morning, the Germans came in.  They orde
red us to get out from the synagogue 
and walk to the railroad station.  That™s
 what we did.  We  followed up, we walked 
in fours, we walked to the railroad sta
tion.  I was looking for a place to run away, 
to hide.  I could not find, the guards were
 too close.  Here I am, already at the 
railroad station, put in a boxcar, locked af
ter a short while, half an hour, an hour, 
two hours, who knows what the time was.  
Here I am in the boxcar, all locked up, 
ready to go to Auschwitz. 
 

Q: Did you know you were going to Auschwitz? 

 

A: I had a feeling because talk was alre
ady that they™re taking to Auschwitz.  
Already it was almost known that they
™re taking the people to Auschwitz.  

{Carmit, they already had a camp, a dete
ntion camp from which they took the 
people from all the little small to
wns around Grodno.  You know, Grodno had a 
tremendous amount of J e wish little, 
tiny towns around Grodno.  When you refer 
now, people tell you, old people, the 
older generation, the __________ it means 
from the state, that the state  of Grodno.  
There were a lot of, a lot of small Jewish 
towns, all predominately Jewish.  They took them all to a camp called Ke lbyshik.  

From there they packed them in the cars,
 in the boxcars to go to Auschwitz}.  

That was before they liquidated Grodno ghe
tto.   {Before the ghe
tto, they sent ---
}. 
 

Q: So you knew already what was happening in town? 

 

A: Yes.  It was little by little.  It was 
known that we™re going to
 Auschwitz.  Anyway 
here I am in the packed box
car with all different kind of
 people, with all different 
kind of ages and I decide d -- I saw a sma
ll little window on the end of the boxcar.  
I decide with some  of my friends, the one
 I was working with.  We tried the hard 
way.  I told him;  I say I™m going to jump. 
 Here we have to break through that 
window.  So some  way we got pushed th
rough, we came close to the window.  
We stood one shoulder, one on the other™
s shoulders, two of us.  We  know our 
power, I don™t know where we got it but 
we pulled out the bars.  We  broke the 
bars, we pulled out the bars and I don™
t know where we got the power and we 
jumped out.  {They started to jump out, one 
after the other}.  On
e after the other.  
I was one that jumped out, the third one.  
I remember I wasn™t the first one but I 

jumped out.  The train, on a curve.  It 
was slowing down on a curve.  I jumped out 

 
38
and I fell down.  I was unconscious and be
fore long I was arrested, put back on 
the truck.  I was arrested by the German
 guard, the one that was watching the 
railroad, the railroad lines, the tracks.  
Before not long, they arrested me  and it 
was already about eight o™cl
ock in the morning.  They brought me  back to the 
synagogue.  During all day, that was ri
ght in the morning, the synagogue was 
empty.  The r e was only a few.  By t hat 
time  already they start finding people 
hiding in the ghetto.  Nobody was already 
out to work.  They discovered all 
different kind of hiding places and they 
brought them into the synagogue.  Before 
long -- anyway, the first day, I looked ar
ound, I did not find Li sa.  The second day 
I had a better chance to look b
ecause I was the only from the first ones.  I did not 
find Lisa.  Till late in the evening, I l
ooked around where can I hide inside the 
synagogue.  I found a place in the synagogue
, had a small little room where there 
was a kitchen before.  Over there was a pile of coal.  I saw a young fellow by the 

name  Ruby Lawrence. {Ruvke Lubich}.  
We ll Lubich was _______.  {R-u-v-k-e  
L-u-b-i-c-h}.  He was a boy from Gr odno 
and he is ma king a place to hide under 
the coal.  After a lot of begging, he let me
 in.  There™s a whol
e story to that too 
but I™ll make it short.  He let me make a 
place right next to him.  By luck, under 
the coal, we found a big piece of plywood wh
at we ma de a roof.  On top of the 
roof, we found some  dea d bodies. We put 
a dead body on top of the roof.  At the 
entrance we found a cooking sheet, where 
we covered up with coal and then 
covered people that ma ybe covered the entrance. 
 

Q: To the hiding place? 

 

A: That was the hiding place.  We  survived
 there.  The next day we heard the same  
thing had happened in the shul.  They took out everybody and we survived there..  
After they emptied it out, the Germans gave an or der the same thing like this, they 
didn™t have the time, that the rest of th
e people who survived {to come  out of the 
hiding} come  out of the hiding --  {they
™re not sending the transports any more} 
they™re not sending the transports any mo
re.  {Again they shrank the ghetto}  
Shrank the ghetto.  {They left four build
ings}.  They left four buildings and I 
went back to the place where I lived.  
I knew where Lisa is hiding.  I found Lisa 
with her father and brother survived the 
same  wa y.  We  stayed for a while in the 
Grodno ghetto.  By that time  a thousand 
or 1,200 Jews they left -- {survived} 
survived.  {Survived the transports.  No
w by this time, people already knew what 
Auschwitz was}.  Yeah and we stayed th
ere a short while.  Finally we made 
contact with Tadek.  Lisa went out of th
e ghetto.  I™ll skip all different kinds of 
things what we had but she ma de a c
ontact.  She knew where Tadek, I gave her 
the address on Tadek.  {Before yet, my fa
ther and my little br other went  with 
Tadek to Vilna}.  Before that they made 
the contact and they left.  After we made 
the contact with Tadek, Lisa went off 
on a Sunday.  She me t him in church and 
then he told her to come  out on Tuesda
y, come out on the public washroom.  I™ll 
meet you on Tuesday in the public wash
room; you come  out and I™ll take you to 
Vilna.  We  took his word; it was very hard to get out through the public 

washroom because the ghetto was all 
surrounded.  You couldn™t get out.  {We 
some how made it}.  Some way we got out
, it was dusk, it was dark, we got out 

 
39
and we came to the public washroom.  Sure enough Tadek, he told her he is going 
to give her a signal.  He™s going to come  
with a pair of overalls
 like an engineer 
working on the railroad and he™s going to 
have a fl ashlight.  He ™s going to blink a 
few times with the flashli
ght; you™ll know from
 farther that that™s me.  Sure 
enough we me t hi m ove r there.  ﬁEverything went the way he saidﬂ.  Everything 

went that, five of us went out.  He to
ok only, he said he can only take two.  
 

 

Q: When Lisa left, you left 
too at the same  ti me , Ar on? 
 

A: Yeah, we went -- Li sa™s fath
er and her brother we nt before. 
 

Q: And then you and --? 

 

A: Then I went with Lisa and Ruvke, my fr
iend, the one that survived Œ {the one that 
he survived in the shul with him}.  Th
e one that survived, the one that let him 

make a place to hide.  So we all mo ved in in one place and we all made the 

contacts with Tadek.  I promised, I told 
that guy Ruvke, I told him that I have a 
Polish fellow, Tadek, and we™ll go to Vilna.  He was part of us going out to the 

public washroom.  But at the same  time he had a nother cousin and a friend so he 

took them too.  When we  came in the public
 washroom we we re five, instead of 
two.  Tadek said he can only take two.  
After a long conversation with Tadek, he 
decided he™ll take three.  
I took Ruvke; he didn™t want 
to go with me  but I talked 
him in.  We  survived together so why 
don™t you come  with us.  Don™t delay it for 
another time.  so all this here went and Ta
dek took us to the -- Tadek says for me , 
Lisa and Ruvke, follow us and we are going 
to the railroad station.  We  followed 
Tadek to the railroad station.  Before 
we came right by the railroad station was a 

small, an empty lot.  {A ditch like, al
ong with the tracks}.  Along the tracks.  He 
told us you hide over there 
and I™ll go around and take a 
look which train is going 
to Vilna.  {Freight train, we™re talking a
bout freight trains.  In
 between the freight 
are a couple cars, passenge
r cars that the We hr macht traveled}.  After he came  
back, he told us, he pointed this is the 
train what is going to
 Vilna but it™s very 
dangerous with the army going.

 He took out what-you-call-it.  He told us 
that™s the train that™s going to move.  He 
warned us when this train starts 
moving, you jump between the boxcars, the 
couplings.  Jump on the couplings and then
 you™ll find a little lever, you™ll climb 
up on top of the roof.  {The roof of th
e car and you should lie on your stomach so 
you won™t be seen from the ground}.  I™ll fi
nd you there later, on top of the train.  
The train starts moving.  We jump out fr
om the place, from the hiding pl ace.  I 
was the first one.  I jumped out, I ju
mped on the moving train between the 
boxcars and I climbed up on top of the 
roof.  Ruvke did the same  thing on a 
different car, he did the same  thing and we
nt up on top of the roof.  Lisa was left 
over the last one, she panicked and she ra
n out.  {I panicked 
as I looked back.  

 
40
There were very few cars that I saw and 
I became terribly frightened that I will 
not have a chance to climb up to the top to
 take the ride.  So I went out and the 
first car that passed by, I grabbed on and 
I stood on a little ledge with the boxcar.  
I held on to the handle of the door}.  She 
held on the handle of the door instead of 
going between the boxcars, she grabbed on the door in the mi ddle of the boxcar.  
Here the train start moving faster and sh
e™s hanging, she™s holding on.  {I was on 
the outside, you know on the outside of th
e boxcar}.  The train is moving and we 
are already on top and we™re out of town
 already.  Here I see where I™m lying, 
Tadek came to me and he said Where™s 
the girl?   {As the train was moving and 
moving fast, he was running all the wa y 
to the end of the train looking for me , 
looking if he could 
spot the girl}. 
 

Q: Whowas?  

 

A: {Tadek}. 

 

Q: Tadek was on top of the 
train or in the train. 
 

A: Ontop. 

 

Q: He also went on top. 

 

A: Yes.  {Maybe he was at first in th
e locomotive but he climbe d up to the top 
because we were on top of the train}.  
So he came  and he found us on top of the 
roof.  He jumped from one roof to th
e other on the running train, in the cold 
weather in March, freezing weather, 
until he  found --.  {He found me  on the 
outside of a boxcar almo st hanging}.  He
 found her hanging on a boxcar.  So he 
came back to us and he told us I found the girl.  We have to go and come  back to 

the boxcar where Lisa was ha
nging.  I, too, and Ruvke too, we jumped with him 
till we came to the boxcar where Lisa is
 hanging.  We  ma
de a huma n chain, 
Tadek lies down on the boxcar on top of 
the roof, we were holding his -- he 
shouldn™t slip down -- we were holding his 
legs.  He bent down much further and 
he grabbed one hand and then he grabbed the other hand.  Then Ruvke was 

holding his feet and I came  to help Ruvke
 to help to pull up Lisa.  We pulled up 
Lisa on top of the roof.  There we 
survived from Grodno to Vilna was 180 
kilometers, sub-zero weat her.  {I wore mittens and I had a visi on that  that  I would 

give him the hand and the mitten would slip.  He would not hold on to my  hand 

but to the mi tten but he was very skilful a
nd I held on with all the strength that I 
possessed to lift myself -- a
nd youth}.  Youth was on our side.  This way we went 
all the way for 180 kilometers
 till the next morning, it was still dark; we came  to 
Vilna.  From Vilna we jumped down, Tadek was first, we followed Tadek.  He 

came and hollered and he says I™m goi
ng to find a big group, one that™s going 

back to the ghetto.  {A group of Jews retu
rning from a night shift to the ghetto}.  
You™ll join the Jews when they™re comi
ng.  {You™ll jump in as you see them; 
you™ll just run in, in the mi
ddle.  That™s the way it was}.  That™s the way it 
happened.  We saw a big group of Jews runni
ng from the night shift going back to 

 
41
the ghetto.  We joined the other ones and we 
went in together.  I will ma ke it fast.  
In the ghetto, it was still 
a lively ghetto, Vilna.  I don™t know how ma ny J e ws 
were there at that time but ma ybe so
me body will study, we™ll find exactly.  We  
came there in March, 1943.  I looked the 
hardest ways to find the underground.  I 
was successful, I found me mbers of a Hashom
er Hatzair; I joined the F.P.O., FPO 
--.  {From Yiddish, F_____, P_____, O_____, I joined and after a few mo nths 
later till in August they d
ecided -- we went through the whole situation in the 
ghetto.  We  decided we™re going to the unde
rground.  {The leadership decided to 
send out after the episode with Edenberg
 which I am sure we _______ the history 
over and over again.  We™re on the ba
rricades.  We went through the whole 
episode of Edenberg in Vilna}.  I join
ed the underground and then Ruvke joined 
and then a group of 30.  We went out from Vilna, we went to the underground.  

We  went to the forest of Narocz. {N-a-r-o-c-z}.  It™s appr oxima tely the same  

thing, 150 kilome ters; it took us seven nights to go there.  The only reason why 

we found the place because two young Jewi
sh fellows {that were in the 
underground already) in their teens, what
 they left the underg
round, they came  to 
the ghetto.  {Risking their lives to be guide
s}.  To be guides to take out Jews to 
the underground. 
 

Q: Now you wa lked? 

 

A: {We walked}.  Seven nights, only nights.
  {In the day we were hiding}.  During 
the day we were hiding. 
 

Q: Did you have any food with you? 

 
A: We got food from far mer s.  {Because 
the fellows that came , they had guns, the 
two fellows, the Jews that came for us}. 
 
Q: So you forced the farmers to give you food? 

 

A: {Yes, we forced the farmers}.  Because they already behaved like partisans.  This 
is the way we  arrived to the partisans.  
We  joined to a group the partisans.  {The 

first group of partisans unit that we jo
ined was a totally Jewish unit called 
Naka ma h}. 
 

Q: Revenge. 

 

A: Revenge.  {But there was a lot of anti-Semites from the Russians and we were 
dispersed.  We could not sta
y, they would not keep us as
 a Jewish unit.  Some  of 
the me mber s from this Naka ma h were put in different units of the Russian 

underground.  When we were liberated, we
 were part of a Russian unit, the 
Kalinski _________.  Kalinski was the presid
ent of Russia, K-a-l-i-n-s-k-i}.  
What were we doing there, in th
e underground, in the partisans? 
 

Q: Kalinskior Kalininski? 

 
42
 
A: {Kalininski, there™s another ﬁnﬂ.}.  Wh
at did we do in the underground?   We did 
all different kinds of sabot
age work.  We  blew up bri
dges, we blocked roads.  
{Ambushes on _____}.  Ambushes on Germans, on German t r oops and I blew up 

trains.  {We also helped Jews -- they
 were hiding wome n 
and children that 
ma naged to escape from the small towns around the woods.  We sort of helped 

them too}.  That™s the way it was going ar
ound.  We lost 30% of our me n we lost 

and from our group, what we went out fr
om the thirty, about ten of them got 
killed in the underground in 
fights and in different ways, till the liberation.  {We 

were liberated the summer of ‚44}.  We 
were liberated the summer of ™44 by the 
Russians.  By chance, being a movie opera
tor, I didn™t have to go to the army.  
Otherwise they send, they pick up everybody imme diately, they gave them 

uniforms and send them to the front lines. 
 But me having my  special trade, this 
was the propaganda, to show movies.  
They gave me  a special place where I 
wouldn™t have to go join 
imme diately in the army.  I went from there --. 
 

Q: Did Lisa go with you? 

 

A: Yes.  {By the way, my father survived
 too.  My father was in the underground.  
Not in the unit but he was in a hut}. 
 

Q: So your father --? 

 

A: {My little brother was caught in the street
 and sent to camp.  He was in, first in a 
labor camp, then he went to Studhoff 
(? ) but I don™t know if you want it}. 
 
Q: That was when they were in Vilna? 
 

A: {Yes}. 

 

Q: Your father, he was with the underground 
in Vilna, not with these 30 people that 
went out?  
 

A: {No, no.  He wasn™t a me mber of
 the  active underground}.  Only in the 
underground they got me  and Lisa.  {But Daddy was in the woods and he lived 

through the German occ upation there}.  He
 knew where we are so he walked by 
hims elf.  He r brother was caught on the 
street and they send him to Studhoff.  
{First he was in a labor camp in Estoni
a.  Then from there he was in Studhoff 
__.} 
 

Q: Aron, do you know wha t  happened to
 your mother a
nd your sisters? 
 

A: No.  The only thing is I found out afte
r the war that nobody survived.  {They were 
in Bialystok, probably we nt to Treblinka
}.  I tried one time to go from Grodno to 

Bialystok but it was not successful.  I had 
to go out to the Polish organizer (?) and 
he never showed up so I never ma de it back.  But all the news what I could get, 

 
43
the people from Slonim t hat were ther
e -- I don™t have any news of anybody 
surviving.  I™m the only one surviving.  To
 finish the story, we were liquidated, I 
mean we were liberated by the Russians a
nd I went to see my home town Slonim.  
Nobody was left and from there, from 
Slonim I went to Beronovich and from 
Beronovich, I went to Bialystok.  {Becau
se you know, as Polish citizens we™re 
allowed to go back to Poland after Pola
nd was liberated by the Russians, parts of 
Poland that  were liberated by the Russian
s}.  I went to Bialystok and Lisa 
followed me .  She came a couple of months
 later; she came to Bialystok because 
she was still left in Beronovich with her fa
ther, only with her father.  Her brother 
they didn™t know if he surv
ived or not.  Lisa stayed with her father and then she 
followed me  to Bialystok.  In Bialystok, 
passport (? ) important to have it.  We 
already got in touch with the Br
_______ through the same  thing, through 
Hashomer Hatzair.  We  were in touch with the B_______ and we got directions to 

go from Ber onovich to Lublin (?).  From Lublin we got documents from t he Red 

Cross that we  are Greek refugees returning 
to Greece.  So we went from Lublin to 

Cracow, to Czechoslovakia to Hungary to 
Austria.  {All with the help of the 
Br______)_.  Then in Austria we went thr
ough the border to the 
west, to the parts 
of --}  We  had to cross to Italy.  {C
ross to Italy where the Americans and the 
English were}. _______ was still controlled by the Russians and we had to cross 

the Russian zone to go over to the Englis
h zone.  We  had to cross the Alps; we 
crossed the Alps and we came to Terevisa 
in Italy.  Over there we me t, for the 
fi r s t  ti me ,  w e  me t  me mb e r s  fr o m t h e  J e w i
sh Brigade.  Haolim fr om the Palestine 
Jewish Brigades.  They were part of th
e English army.  They, with trucks, they 

took us under their protection and they t
ook us from Terevisa to Bologna.  {From 
Bologna to Florence}.  From Florence 
to Rome  and in Rome , we were two 
youngsters.  At that time it was impossible to
 -- Palestine was all the blockades.  
You could not go to Palestine.  The 
only ones if you could come  through, you 
would be arrested and sent to Cyprus.  For me , be ing all my dream to go to 

Palestine, {look where he ended up}, I decided that I™m going for a short stop.  

{Meanwhile what Aron did not tell you that
 I had a grandmother in America.  I 
had aunts and uncles and cousins.  All my 
fa mily was in America}.  I™m going to 
tell you. 
 

Q: So you could go there? 

 

A: {Yes}.  For a short while.  {We really went for a short while I want you to know.  
Because the family so much wanted us 
to come }.  But when we were in Rome , 
we  decided we™re going to get married.  
We  got ma rried in a big synagogue in 
Rome  on M a rch 25, 1943.  {Forty-five, ™
47, what are you talking about?   Show 

these survivors how they know dates!}  March the 25
th
, 1947, we got married in 
Rome  in a big synagogue.  Then after, 
we took off and went to America.  {We 
came in April, April 1
st
}  April 1
st

went to settle in Chicago.  In Chicago, we
 start raising a family and we did pretty 
well.  We  ha ve three sons, all doctors, 
me dical doctors.  {Physicians, you want 
their names or it is
 not necessary}.
