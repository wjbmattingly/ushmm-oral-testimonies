Q: We  are speaking with Mr. Jack Polak about hi
s father, Fredrik Polak. The date is March 2, 
1992. 
 Mr. Polak, what could you tell us 
about your father?   Can you tell 
us first his date of birth and 
place of birth? 
 

A: He was born inAmsterdam inAugust 1883. He wa
s part of a very relig
ious fa mily, was the 
smartest of five children.  One died very early.  He  had three sisters and one brother.  So, there 

were six children, one must have died early, a
nd the other four, he had one blind brother and 
three sisters, all ma rried. Two 
sisters without children, one sist
er without children.  None came 
back.  My father worked hims elf to become  an 
accountant.  He  was a very respected member of 
the Jewish community, as well as of the genera
l community he was a learned ma n.  He was a 
fantastic fr iend for children.  I do recall di stinctivel
y that in summer vacati
ons when we went to 
the seashore in Holland, all the ch
ildren of all nephews and even ma ny friends always came  to 
him telling stories and even today I have certain 
stories and certain songs
 my father was singing 
at those seashores which my grandchildren now
 treasure because they know it comes from their 
grandfather who they never knew.  He worked
 hims elf as an accountant very hard, however 
never knew how to ma ke money on it because 
he became an accountant of many charitable 
organizations and on which he always charged the 
mi ni mu m. As such his entire life he went 
through week by week also ma ny me mbers of his 
fa mily depended on him.  He had to pay for 
his blind brother, he had to s
upport his sisters ma ny times, and as such we know he had always 

a hard time .  Still, he was always happy and 
my father and mother had a very happy marriage 
and he was also able to bring the joy of bei
ng part of the orthodox fa mily to us.The Friday 
nights were wonderful testimony of how an
 orthodox fa mily should live a Shabbat. 
 

Q: Do you know about how he me t your mother
 and when, and when they got ma rried? 
 

A: I don™t know much about it. All 
I know is it was a very close re
lationship in all the sisters of 
my mother.  I will talk to you a
bout my mother in a few mi nutes.  My mother came  from a well- 
known fa mily in Holland and everyThursday night 
all brothers and sisters of that family came 
together at one of the homes of one of the si
sters of the fa mily of my mother. And these 
wonderful, joyful occasions for all of them to co
me  together. Al most none of them c a me back. 
 

Q: So your parents me t then and ma rried pr
obably in the early tu
rn of the century. 
 

A: They must have ma rried, because I was born in 1912. There was one son born to them who 
died very young, at one or two years old.  So I 
would say that they must have gotten ma rried 
ma ybe in 1907 or 1908.That is what I suspect. They lived inAmsterdam.  My mother was a 

teacher.  She was a teacher in shor thand and she was a teacher in (asked hi s wife) how do you 

call that? Wi fe: Sewing, but its 
not sewing clothes, it™
s like embroidery and 
fancy stitches.  I 
don™t know how you call it. 

 
Q: Crafts? 

 

A: Some thing, anyway she was teaching in the Je
wish elementary school.  I know there was once a 
problem because, although they were orthodox, she 
never wear a wig and they wanted her to 

wear a wig. There was a big commot ion in th
e Jewish community because how can a Jewish 
teacher in a Jewish community teach.  But she got
 a certificate from th
e doctor that it would 
endanger her health to wear it and she got away 
with it.  I reme mber there was a big discussion 
about it at that time . She was a very respected 
teacher in every way.  Not only that she later 
became part of the federal examination procedur
es in which she was part, really, of federal 
(wife:What they did is when you did your fi
nal exams from high school which were really 
exams, not just a test, official, the governme nt w
ould send a delegate to sit 
in on the orals.  First 
the written on all subj ects and then the oral.  
And they would send always one person to sit there 
so the schoolteacher would ask th
e question and not add somethi
ng, it was honor.) We  lived in 
the first years of my 
life on the second floor of a house which was very cramped quarters.  
Certainly not rich living, to the contrary, it 
was very poor living. I recall my own Bar  Mitzvah 
reception was done at our home and people had to
 crawl on steps which were very na rrow.  
Even Bar Mitzvah parties were not comparable
, still I reme mber my Bar Mitzvah having a 
dinner Friday night, which was a fantastic dinner
, at our home pre-prepared themselves and the 
reception all prepared only at our own home . A
ll our lives we were just  making it.  During the 

summer my parentsalways took in
 paying guests. That way they
 were able to give us a 
summer vacation on the seashore. We  always 
had paying guests.  In fact, one of the young 
paying guests we had is now living in Scarsdale. 
 I always reme mber that little boy who came  to 

us because hi s parent s, at that time, paid 
us for him to stay with us at that time. 
 

Q: So, it seems your fa mily life was very happy? 
 
A: Ve ryhappy. 

 

Q: Can you tell us what you know about what
 happened to your mother during the war? 
 

A: My father and mother, I would say after 
I joined the ___________ pract
ice, maybe I™m more 
materialistic than my mo ther and father, I really
 showed him t hat he should charge mo re and 
some where they got a much nicer living after I 
joined them. We  were able to ma ke some  
money and save a little bit money and they were 
able to move to better quarters, and I would 
say the last years of their life was much happier. 
 Of course, they had their daughters.They had 
my older sister who was ma rried to a very su
ccessful businessman and a nice ma n, although he 
ma y have be en a woma nizer, he was a very ni
ce ma n.  I was very proud of the fa mily.  My 
younger sister, who ma rried that young columnist, wa
s the darling of my father and they always 
compare my  daughterand me  with
 my sister and my father. I 
think I am treating my daughter 
the same  way as my father treated his favorite, my 
sister Betty, and even today I have to talk to 
my youngest sister always, that Be
tty was always the love of her father.  She knows that and she 
knew how to handle him too. Betty had a very in
teresting life and she was a wonderful woma n.  
Even my first wife, like I say, was crazy about my
 father.  My father was a fantastic ma n.  Even 
today when I talk to people, anybody I talk who 
knew my fat her always ta
lks about him that he 
was such an unusual ma n.  So, as such, I have th
e greatest me mory.   So we had a happy life and 
when the war started, yes, he saw they had no 
choice, they may have had a chance to go into 
hiding but it never dawned on them.  It never da
wned on all of us really how serious it was and 
what was going to happen to all of us.  For the la
st year of his life he was able, because of his 

importance in the Jewish community, to stay l
onger than ma ny other people. The deporting 
started in July 1942, he was taken away in June 
1943, as such he was a li
ttle bit longer than the 
norma l.  He was taken last of all for another f
our weeks, but even then he was not important 
enough to be saved.  So he was taken away on July 23, 1943. 
 
Q: Both of your parents? 

 

A: Both, they were taken away. They went in a ve
ry prestigious trai n, ther e were several rabbis in 
that.  I don™t know if you saw the mo vie. ﬁEs
cape from Sobibor.ﬂ And you ma y recall how all 
these well-dressed people arrived in Sobibor.  
So my father and mother, the way they were 
dressed in their best clothes, 
arriving in Sobibor. And that was it. They died two days.  
Everybody who, I think the number is that 40,000 pe
ople went to Sobibor and I think about 100. 
 

Q: Fewer than 300 survived. Fift
y people survived the uprising. 
 

A: You got the number from Engle, becau
se he was one of the few survivors. 
 

Q: Is there something about your mother
™s  personality that you could recall? 
 

A: My mother ™s  personality was also very outgoing,
 very friendly. A real mo ther.  I don™t recall 
any fights my parents ever had. They were ju
st a wonderful congenial gamily.  My mother 
came from a quite a big family.  Eight or nine brot
hers and sisters. Her fath
er had died at a very 
early age.  He was in the diamond industry, a
nd my grandmother lived for a long time died, I 
think in 1936 or 37.  I knew my grandmother.  
My mother came from a very close-knit family.  
All the si sters came together almost, like I said, 
everyThursday night and fr om that family only 

three survived in hidi ng. A niece, interesting enough, other people were not orthodox people.  
From that fa mily, the three people we re not or
thodox at all.  One we
nt with the Palestine 
transpor t to Palestine and they lost  their only so
n and one other sister wh
o went into hiding lost 
their only son and one sister and 
brother- in-law survived in hi
ding with their 
two children who 
are now living inAustralia
 and the United St ates.  She worked 
very hard.  She ma de sure that 
we got a good upbringing, but in the meanti me  they
 were both working, they had to ma ke a 
living and still I never had any id
ea of poverty.  I knew there was no money, but I st ill never had 
no idea that we were poor at a
ll. Although we were poor.As su
ch we had a wonderful life. 
 
Q: Is there anything else about either of your
 parents that you can in
clude?  Do you know what 
they did inWesterbork? They were inWesterbork for a short time? 
 

A: They were inWe sterbork from June 43 to July 43, only four weeks. 

 

Q: You weren™t even there yet? 

 

A: No, I came, I was there for one week with
 them, so I saw them really for one week. 
 

Q: So that was the last time  you saw them?  

 

A: That was the last time I saw them.  Just for 
one week. At that time 
already my young sister was 
with me .  She was inWe sterbork and my other si
ster, two sisters were in
Westerbork with me at 
that time. 
 

Q: The fa milies were allowed to meet and talk? 
 

A: InWe sterbork you had close cont act really.  It
 was permitted. You could talk to anybody.  In 
Bergen Belsen, it was much more difficult. There was work. When I wor ked in the kitchen 

from three o™clock in the morning, I didn™t se
e anybody, only certain peop
le in the kitchen.  
That™s  why I left little notes for my wife, just to say what I am doing and what is happening. 
 

Q: We ll, I think that can conclude our discu
ssion about your parents. Thank you very mu ch. 
 
                                                         
Sister Julia Bola 
 
Q: We  are speaking to Mr. Polak a
bout his sister, Julia Bola.  Mr. 
Polak what can you tell us about 
Julia? When was she born, where was sh
e born, what was she like as a child? 
 

A: My sister Julia was a. I woul
d say, a woma n with problems.  I 
hate to say that.  Basi cally she 
always had emotional problems from early date o
n.  She was in a way, she was beautiful.  She 
was smart as all our kids and sometimes being 
smart doesn™t  ma ke it easiest in life, and she 

suffered.  I think some where by the fact that my fa
ther favored my younger si
ster at a later date.  
She was crazy about a young ma n who she me t 
in the Zionist Moveme nt, and they were 
engaged and they got ma rried, and they shouldn™t 
have gotten ma rried beca
use he was as nice 
and smart a ma n as he was, he was certainly no
t the right man for her 
and she never recognized 
that. They fortunately I would say, had no child
ren. They were on the forefront of the Zionist 
Moveme nt in Holland. Both he and she were good 
speakers. They taught Hebrew.  Her Hebrew 
was much better than mi ne.They were planning 
to go to Palestine.  I don™t recall exactly how 

and where, but there is a book ju
st out now about all the peopl
e who were in the Hav Shara 
move me nt in Holland and her name  is me ntioned in that book, which ma de me  sure that she 
was really in the Hav Shara Moveme nt before 
the war.  She got ma rried, I think, in 1938, and 
stayed inAmsterdam until July ™43. They were se
nt in the same transport as I toWe sterbork.  
They also were put on the Palestine list. With th
e Palestine list they came to Bergen Belsen.  Of 
course being young they were not allowed 
to go with the Pale stine transport. 
 
Q: What year was that? 

 

A: That was in July 1944.  She has a terrible time 
in Bergen Belsen.  She deteriorated fast, she 
looked terrible when I last saw her, which was,
 as I recall, only the beginning ofApril 1945 in 
Bergen Belsen. We  didn™t see each ot her too mu
ch because I worked in the kitchen.  I do not 
know anything more than that they both went with 
the same  train in those cattle cars inApril 11, 
1945 leaving Bergen Belsen and going to Germa ny.
  She was liberated together with me  in 
Tr ovitz, near Leipzig and must ha
ve died two days after liberati
on.  I learned that only, I would 
say, one week after I came out of a coma , they 
didn™t tell me  right away,and in fact I do recall 
that about one week after I came out of the coma 
they told me  that Roosevelt had died and that 
my sister had died. 
 

Q Can we go back ma ybe to, do you know, did she have
 any interests as a child?   Did she play any 
instrume nts?  Did you have any pets in the family?   
 

A: We  never had. Ye s, we must have had cats so
mewhere. I remember some thing about cats.  But, 
basically we were never pet lovers, so I don™t recall 
at all that we had pets.  We  all played an 
instrume nt.  One of the things I do recall is 
notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my 

parents always teach us piano or
 vi olin, whatever it was.  I 
had two years of piano lessons 
which was a complete waste.  But, I do recall 
because some body in a good fa mily had to learn 
some instrument.  I don™t reme mber what my 
sis t ers learned, but I™m sure they did too. 
 
Q: Wa s she friendly, did she have a lot of friends? 

 

A: She was friendly, she had a lot of friends.  He
r friends circled around the same  friends we had.  
Mostly of the Zionist groups.  I 
really was more personally I was 
more geared to the non-Jewish 
friends I coul d get.  Maybe at that time alrea
dy I felt more I was a me mber of the basketball 
club, which had about twenty percent Jews.  Oreighty percent non-Jews then.  Not that it was 

ever me ntioned to us or stated that it was twenty
 and eighty percent.  Now 
I recall at  a later date 
really, you know, I don™t think she went out to 
the non-Jewish world as mu ch as I did.  Of 
course having worked at the Carlton Hotel in 
A m s t e r d a m,  i t  ma d e  me  a l
s o better understand the 
importance of the non-Jewish world to the Jewish 
people.  But she circled really around the life 

of completely Zionist life. That
 was ninety percent of her life. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you w
ould like to me ntion about Julia? 
 

A: No. The only thing I can say 
is that I do recall th
at in March 1945, she was very hungry and I 
had a little pi ece of bread and she asked me  for that
 piece of bread.  I ne ve r gave it to her. Now, 
if the psychiatrist would exam
ine me  he would say you have tr
emendous guilt thinki ng about it, 
and would have the rest of your life.  I must say 
in all honesty I felt at that mo me nt that piece of 
bread could save my life and I didn™t give it to my
 sister.  But I still thi
nk about it.  It wouldn™t 
have saved her life anyway, but things like that
, you know, stay for a long time. That was about 
the last time  I saw her.  One of the horrors of life. 
 
Q: Thank you very much for your time .
