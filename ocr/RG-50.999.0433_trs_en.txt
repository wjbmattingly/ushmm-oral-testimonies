W ith that I'd liketoask you to join me in welcom ing our

B o b B eh r .  
 
[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:  B
ob
,welcom e and thank you som uchf or your willi ngness to be with us today 
as our
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
.  
Ihada number of tim esthe opportunity totalkwith you.  I know that if we 
hadthe time, we could spend all afternoon and beyond with as much as you have to share 
with us.  But we have an hour, so we'll try to get throughasm uchof what Bob hasto tell 
us  i n  
th a t tim e.
 
 
Bob, let's begin today with you telling us about your early years, 
what those years were  like that preceded Kristallnacht or Night of the Broken Glass. 
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, you can actually break this down intotwo distinct dates. As all
 
of you 
know, I'm  sure you do, Hitler came to power on the30th of January 1933.  That m eansI was 

already 11 years old.  So you have a period thatbefore Hitler and then after Hitler
 c
am e t o  
power.  And that is,of  course,a trem endousam ount of diff erenc
e.
 
 
I was a kid.  I grew up
 
--
 
m y f irst memory of the Holocaust was 
m y f ather.  My f ather was like the kidstoday.  T he kids today, in m y house anyway, the T V 

goes whether anybody watches or not,but itgoes.  And so m yf ather in those days listened to 
th e
 
r ad i o
 d
ay in, day out.  He was an MD
;  
sowhen he was not dealing with patients, he 
listened tothe radio.
 
 
W hy I do mention this?  Becausem yf irst mem ory of  the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Holocaust, Iheard a guy scream ing over theradio about Jewish conspiracy.  Jews had caused 
t
he loss of  W orld W ar I
.  S
o what do youthink when you're a kidand you hear things and don't 
understand it? I was alwa ys close to m y mother.  I went tom y m other and said, "
M
om , wh a t 
thehell is the Jewish conspiracy?"  And m y m other said, "
D
on't worr y a
b o u t it.  It's no t 
som ething you have to worr y about. If  yourf ather wants to listento this, lethim . You don't 

worr y. W e live in af ree country. W e live in a dem ocracy.  You have nothing to worry about."   
So what do you do? "
W
hen you hear this, you don't worry
.
"   So I didn't.
 
 
And then suddenly ononeday, ladiesand gentlemen, on one 
m iserable, lousy day, the 30th of  January 1933, everything changed.  Hitler becam e chancellor 
of  Germ any.  Hitler becam e them ostpowerful person in theGerman republic
 
which was 
heretofore
 
a democracy.  And everything else faded. Som y lifef rom  oneday to thenext 
changed.
  
T he peoplewho were yelling about Jewish conspiracy, and the Jews aremisgi vings, 
those peoplenow wer e in power
, c
ould im plem ent all the threats they had made against Jews.  
Now they could do it. 
 
 
And ladiesand gentlem en, inanswer to hisquestion, what was 
it before, it radically changed. I will have a hard tim e describing to you inthe time Ihave how 
lif e changed in the cityof Berlin.  
 
 
How m any of you have been to Berlin?  I want some hands.
  
High.  Quiteaf ew.  It's now a beautiful city.  It was not abeautif ul city then. But it was our 
home. And suddenly i n this city which we used to like and which we grew up in
, 
resented us, 
disliked us,persecuted us.  How did that manifest itself?  Signsall over theplace. " Jews not 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
allowed."  " Jews not wanted."  " Jews not admittedhere."   It was going on and on.
 
 
T he Nazis are masters of propaganda.  And the propaganda 
was raining on the Germ an people, including the city of  Berlin.  Andevery day there was 
som ething badabout Jews.  I could spend hours with you and give you examples,but 
unf ortunately I don't have thatm uch time.  Just thinkabout your hom etown, wherever you are 
f rom ,and the things you like to do:  
p
lay ball, go to am ovie, go to a restaurant. Can't do 
anything anym ore.T hat's the way it was with us.
 
 
My f avorite sport was swim m ing.  I loved to swim .  So when you 
swim , you needtwo things, right?  You needa pool and you need water. And what the 

Germ ans did, they integrated the third elem ent, a pool, water, anda big sign, " Jews not 
allowed here."  W edon't want Jews in the swim m ing pool. And sothe 
scre ws 
were getting 
tighter and tighter.  It became a city in which instead of loving it, we feared it. W e were af raid.  

It dribbled
 
on us every day.  Im ean, the Nazis were determ ined toeradicate Jewish lif e.
 
 
Bef ore I go to the next question,I want to explain one thing to 
you.  And I'm going tobe quitehonest. If I hurt your f eelings,f orgive  m e.  I was born Jewish.  
My parents were Jewis h.  But that was a name on apieceof  paper only. W hat we really were, 
m y parents especially
 
--
 
I never had any brothers and sisters.  My mother tookone look atm e 
when I was born and said enough isenough,and we're not going tohave another ch
ild  look ing 

like him . So that was the endof  that one.
 
 
In any case,m y parents were Germ an.  My father was anoff icer 
in  W
orldW arI, decorated with the Iron C
ro ss, F
i rs t  
C
lass, and was enormously proudof  it.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
7
 
W e were Germ ans
 w
hen we were Jewish.  Keep this inm ind.  It hurts you because the very 
people to whom  you want to belong says we don't want you.  You can be a Jew, that'sf ine.  
But we don't want you.
 
 
In 1934, in September, the Nazis had a big rally.  Rem ember, in 
1933 they assumedpower.  A year
 
later theyhadthat rally.  T hey took over our citizenship.  
From  onem om ent to the next we were no longer Germ an citizens.W e were residents. They 

didn't kickus out. W ewere a resident, meaning we were allowed tostay there. But we could 
not partici
pate inGerman lif eanym ore. W e were not allowed.
 
 
It goes allacross the board.  Myf ather was adoctor. He was no 
longer allowed to treat German patients.  Hewas no longer allowedto collect moneyf rom  
Social Security
 
--
 
f romthe insurance com panies. 
 
It was going on.  So you get
 
the idea of what 
lif e  wa s  lik e .  A
nd what that does
,  
itm akes you af raid. 
 
 
Now, you canthink,how did they know that you were a Jew?  
Good question.  First of all, which m ost of you guys m ay not know, aGerm an birth certif ic
ate 
has a line item  in it which says religion.  It was m andatory to bef illed out. So theGermans had 
it ona silver platter. They knew exactl y who were Jewish, who wer e not.
  
So itbecame a lif e 
of  an xie ty.  It b e cam ea  life  off ea r.  
 
 
I'm  being very honestwith you. W e were af raid because the 
punishm ent was drastic every tim e you did som ething wrong
, i
ncluding crossing the street! If  a 
Germ an crossed the street the wrong wa y, you got a warning.  If  wedid and theyf oundout 
you were a Jew, they beat youupfor it.  Could you do som ething about it?  Not really.  You 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

could try to getout, which wasn't easy. While President Roosevelt wasn't exactly help
fu l
 
to  ge t 
out.
 
 
So Iam hoping in the tim ethat Ihave to give you a picture of an 
idea what lif e was
 
likefrom  com pletef reedom to totaloppression inever yday lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob,before we turn toKristallnacht in November of1938, you were sent to 
boarding school inSweden.  T ellus a little bit about that. W hy? 
 
>> Bob Behr:  Ok.  Num berone,
 
thebadnews.  My parents gotdivorced.  I stayed with m y 
m other. And m y mother was a person who accom plishedthings which almost hard
 
--
 
yo u ' ll 
see later on what shedid.  But right now thequestion, shefoundout there was a boarding 

school in Sweden. 
 
 
Now, f or thoseof  you who are ver y good in geography, letm e 
just tell you, Sweden was aneutral country, nothing to do with anti
-
Se m itism , af re e  co un try.  It 
had goodm oney.  Ithad good people. And what I mean by goodm oney is valuable money.  
Money
 
is judged by the ability to exchange itinto other currency.
 
 
Som y m otherf ound out that there was aboarding school. And 
lo and behold, I told you before that wom an was am azing, she accom plished things, she got 
m e enrolled.  T here were about 40 of  us, 
a ll Ge rm an
-
Jewish kids, and we were adm itted tothe 
school. 
  
Suddenly we were out ofGermany. It was 1936, 1937. W e were in af ree country, 
could say what we wa nted, could do what we wanted,as long as itwas within the law
.  N
o 
m ore Nazis, no more 
ch i c
anery
, no m ore hatred, nothing. 
 
 
So endof  story?  No! Because asf aras thisis concerned, it 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

lasted six m onths. W hen my mother, six m onths later, went tothe bank and said," Ineed to 
exchange
ﬂ
--
 
I don't rem em ber, 300m arks into Swedish currency, the 
cle rk sa ys,  
ﬁN
o  mo re
.  
W
e do not exchange m oney anym ore for tuition purposes
.  W
ehave other problem s andno 
m oney.
ﬂ 
 
So what happened to the school? It closed. Six m onths later 
we were called together and told that the school was closed. But, the Director said, " I got good 
news f or you.W ef ound Swedishf am ilies who are willing to take you in." T here were 40of us.  
ﬁ
You can stay in Sweden.  You don'thave togo back to Germ any. All we need f rom  you is a 
letterf rom  your parents that they have noobjections if you stay here.
ﬂ
  
Asf aras I know, 38 
people, parents, happily si gned it,aff idavit
,  
tha t 
their kids could stay in Sweden
 
and two didn't.  
I'll gi ve you aboutf ive seconds to think who the second was.  But my m other, the energetic, 

wonderful wom an, says, 
ﬁY
ou're com ing home.  Idon't want you tostay here.  I need youto 
c o m e h om e.
ﬂ 
 
Behind the statem ent, the long story which I don't want to bother 
you because I'm f rom a pretty dysfunctionalfam ily
 
--
 w
ell, it's true. You m ay say I am  
t oo
, b u t 
y
ou don't really know that yet. Give m ea chance.  By thetime Iam f inished, you m ay say he's 
dysf unctional, too. Inany case, I had to
 c
ome back and that was the end of that Swedish 

adventure.

Bill Benson:  Novem ber
 
10, 1938, was the night of what's known as Kristallnacht or Night of  
the Broken Glass. Onthatnight vicious attacks tookplace against Jews, their businesses, 
their homes, all over Germ any.  You were 16at that tim e.  Hundreds of  synagogues were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
burned.  You were 16. How did that personally aff ect you and yourfam ily? 
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, ina way, psychologicall y it did,physically it didn't.  I don't know if  you all 
know the backgroundof  Kristallnachtor what happened.  Idon't
 
have an opportunity to go into 
the thing.  But,I remem ber that m y mother told me she receivedaphone callf rom  som ebody.  

I have no idea who.  And thatperson told m ym other
 d
on't let your son getout of  thehouse 
tomorrow, which was the night, 8th or 9thof Novem ber, 1938.  And shedidn't.  For whatwe 

did not experience was any physical harm to com e. W asthere physical harm?  You bet ya 
there was.  Not only did they set the synagogues onf ire,they took the Jewish holy scripture 
andthrew them  on thef loor andm ade the Germ ans walk across it.
  
I told youbefore, we were 
not very Jewish, butthat's above and beyond the call of  righteousness. 
 

 
Som y biological father was arrested. 40,000Jews were 
arrested in Berlin alone, eeny, m eeny
, m in y, m o
e
, up  to
 
the concentration cam ps.  All in 
revenge f orthe assassination in Paris.  So Kristallnacht hurt us very m uch.  
 
 
My f ather was ina concentration cam p.
  
T heonly wa y you could 
get out isf rom the concentration cam p, on aship, andoff  someplace
, a
nother country.  I never 
saw him  again. And that was it. 
  
Hedid getout.  If ound that out. He made his way to 

Am ericaand died here in the time after liberation
 
in  
1945
.  W
hen I f inally m ade it to America, 
while I was on the ship, he died.  So I literally never saw him  again after he was arrestedon 

Kristallnacht.
 
 
Life after this was terrible. T hereare things which m ost people 
don'teven know.  Af ter the assassination in Paris, theburning of thesynagogues and the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
looting, there was additional things. T he Germ ans didtwo things. Num ber one, they went to 
thebig insurance companies who had insured the synagogues andthe Jewish stores and told 
these owners of  the insurance companies
,  ﬁY
ou will pay, you will rei m burse the damage, 
but
ﬂ 
--
 
they added
 Œ  ﬁ
not to the owner, the Jew.  You will gi ve it to the governm ent.ﬂ  So if  there 
was a 50,000or 100,000m ark indem nity to be paid, then the Germ ans took it andthe owner 
got nothing
, l
ost his insurancemoney in addition. 
 
 
Furthermore,and that's where we cam e in
 
--
 
we didn't have a 
store.  My father was a doctor.  But they levied af ineonus, on the entire Jewish comm unity in 
Germ any, of  onebillion.  And, please, that'snota m istake. T hat'sa B
, one
 
billion m arks which 
the Jews had to collect and turn over to the governm ent.
 
 
How m any Jews were there?  The Germ an populationat the 
tim e was 65
 
m illionpeople. Jews were 500,000.  You do them ath. T hat's noteven 10%. But 
they m adeus pay. W e had to sell m y mother's jewelr y to even m ake our quota, to d
o  tha t.  S o  
that gives you af eeling of the German ideaof revenge.  They took itand we had to hold still 

and take it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob, you would continue living in Berlin with your m otheruntil 1942 whenyou 
were arrested. Tell usa little bit about that tim ebetweenKristallnacht, after your motherhad 
to sell the jewelry and helppay for thef ine and when you were arrested in 1942.  During that 
several
-
year windo w, brief ly, what was lif e like for you then?
 
>> Bob Behr:  Ok.  Rem em ber I told you guys that I cam e backf rom  Sweden becausemy 

m other wouldn't sign the letter. And so I cam eback,and we're now talking about 1937,19
 
--

early 1938,before Kristallnacht. T he Germ ans had established aforced labor arrangem ent.  
T hat's not slave labor.  I
 
want tobe sure. It'snot slave labor.  Forced labor meant you hadto 
go and work where the Germans want you towork
.  A
nd you could not,for exam ple, say I don't 
feel well and sof orth.  
 
 
I had to go when I came back
 
--
 
they establisheda special off ic
e 
for this. For the Berlin Jewish young peopleandm iddle
-
aged people had to goevery m orning 
and get work assignm ents.  This was ourm anual labor. It was diff icult.  Forexam ple, I gota 

job carrying coal.  They had central heating all over the city, andthey had tohave coal.  So we 
went on a truck andbrought the coal. And then you hadto bring itdownstairs in thebasement
 
w
here they hadthe stove.  Or you hadto take bricks upona construction site.
 
 
You know, ladiesandgentlemen, when I look at y
our f aces, 
you're all too young to rem em ber.  But inthose days they didn't have all the cranes they have 

today.  It was m anual labor thatbroughtthose bricks up there. And that was my job.  It was 
ve r y d if f ic u lt .
 
 
Furthermore, theoff ice where we had to
 
report to was 
approxim ately 12
 
kilometersf rom  where we were.  How did you get there? You say streetcar.  
W ecouldonly allow certain street cars.  Never m ore than two Jews.  They wouldn't let us in. 
 

T o tell you how I got there, that's the way I got there.  I went onm y bicycle.  Rain or shine, I 
bicycled the 12
 
k ilom e te rs
 
down in them orning and the12 
kilom e te rs b a ck.  I  ca llm yse lf  lucky 
thatI was young enough and strong enoughto do all the work whic h I hadtodo.
 
 
Just as an aside, after the war, 
the new gover nm ent,dem ocratic 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
republic, Germany, a rich country, they want to reimburseusf orall the suffering we've done.  
T hey cam e up with the enorm ous and intelligentdecision, we're going to give them
 
$5 a day 
for every day they suffered. I suffered 12 years.  Multiply this by 365 days timesf ive marks 

and youthinkI would get all them oney.  No. But they taxed that,too.  Anyway.  So we are not 
theonly oneshere who are suff eringf rom  taxes.  T hey m ade us.  So that gives you som e idea 
how the tim e was betweenour arrests.  It was work, work, work.
 
 
Letm e just addone thing.  W e were no longer allowed 
entertainm ent. W e couldn't go to a movie
, c
ouldn't go tothe theater
, c
ouldn't go to the music 
hall
, c
ouldn't godancing.  So what do you do?  You're 17, 18 years old.  You want to live.  You 
want to be young.  Butyou couldn't do it anym ore because they woul dn't let you in. So we 
solved that. W ehad housepartiesand well organized. W e tookour parents andfanned them  
out. Fam ily A, parents go tofam ily B, and the kidsf rom f am ily B cometofam ily A apartment 
and we had house parties.  No supervision because we had written off ourparents. And I'm 
not going to give you any details what we did.  But I tell you, we compensated a little bitfor
 
a ll 
the suff ering we had there. W ell, I'm  not going to go intoany
 
m ore details.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bob,during that tim e, what did your m otherdo? 
 
>> Bob Behr:  My m other didn't do anything.  She was ahousewif e.  She never had a job. She 

never
 
--
 
she didn't go to the universit y or do anything.  She was justtherepractically
 
--

B

popular with another doctor who had thename of  
H

also hisnam e. And those two met. I don't know

I wasn't there.  Irely on m y m other's story.  
He asked hertom arry m y mother. And m y mother came to me andsaid, 
ﬁS

And I said, 
ﬁY
ou know, you shouldn'task m ethat. I mean, that's adecision you will 
have to m ake.

And she said,

And then oneday hem et the three of us.  And he repeatedhis 
off er tom arry.  And
 
hesaid som ething, ladies and gentlem en, that saved m y lif e,otherwise I 
wouldn't beheretoday.  He said, "Lily, m arry m e.  Iam a veteran of W orld W ar I.  And it'sa 
good possibility that the Nazis will not punishthe veterans, the German veterans, of 
W

T o makea long story short, they didm arry.  And it was true, as 
you wi ll hear later, that our lives, the life of m y father, stepf ather, and m other, were saved 

because of his service.  I hateto speculate what would have happenedtous if s
he had not

I

years. W e liked it.  We had never hurt anybody. W ehad never harm ed anybody.  So we 
ignored it.
 
 
Guess what we did? W hat we got? W e gota second letter. A 
little rougher in tone.  "

my mot

So yes, she got the nam e.  Yes, she metthepries

Now, you thinkthat's a happy end story? W atch. 
 
So what does

T he next day, or two days

it sta rte d.  
 
 
W e were not under the normal evacuation. Because

if  it hadn'tbeenfor the postcard,I don'tknow how m uch longer we could have stayed.  
But thebottom  line is that postcard existed,and the Nazis tookappropriateaction to arrestus.

>> B

in history, there was such a thing as theAustria
-
Hungarian Monarchy.  In1918, when the 
Austrians lost the war, sam e as theGermans, theT reaty of  Versailles rearrang
ed all of  
Europe. 
 
Andam ong other things, this
 
area where 
T heresienstadt
 
islocated becam e the 
Czech Republic. Before that it was Austria.  Austria was gone. T heem pire.  Andnow the 
Czech owned that. 
  
Alot of history invol ved.  I don't want to bore you with it.  But in 1939, 
Hitler m arched into Czechoslovakia andtookit over.  Czechoslovakia ceasedtoexist.  
 

 
T heresienstadt
 
was aGarrison city under the Czech Republic.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

Suddenly theGermans m oved in. T he Czechs had no more Arm y.  So the city, with the 
exception of the civilian dependents who lived there, the city was em pty
 a
nd that they decide 
we're going to m akeaconcentr
a t i on  c am p
, b
uild a wall around it.  A bus going to Prague two 
or three times a week.  You can visit that place.  Only about 35, 40m inutes by bus.  
 
 
So the city was em pty.  And the Germ ans decided.
  
So they 
went to the Czech Jews in Pragueand say here is your city, you're going to be imprisonedup 
there. And the Czechran the cam p. T he Germ an Jews
 
--
 
those who they didn't sendto the 
east were sent there as well.  Mostly old people or special people like ours, veterans. 
 
 
Now, let m e just give you some
 
idea of the com plexity of that 
thing.  Very brief ly, there were 4,000 dependents living there in little tiny houses, still exist.  

Ever ything is still there.  T he Germ ans kicked those guys out. And now they had an em pty 
city.  And in that city where they
 
had 4,000, give or take a few, people living up there which 
were kicked out, they stuffed 60,000people.You cannot im aginehow m iserable life was.  It 

was so overcro wded.
 
 
How m any of you likesom etimes in your day or in your weeks a 
m om ent of privacy?  I want to see your hands. T hank you. That'sgreat.  Because that's 
e xa ctly h o w I fe lt. E xce p t in 
Theresienstadt
 
there was noescaping from  people. You were 
never alone!  You were never alone.W e slept 40 people in one room
, n
o straw, no beds,not 
even a nail onthe wall to hang som ething.  Itwas so overcro wded that people kept dying of 
diseases.
 
 
My f irst job in this m iserable place was to carry dead bodies.

Again, letm e throw out to you that even though I personally didn't have the pleasureto know 
you, that when you had adeath in your fam ily, it was a solem noccasion

som ething moreappropriate. This was nothing.  Thepeoplediedf rom diseases, s

W eall looked like Idon't know what, because the Nazis wanted that we look like som ething

Som y f irst job was tocollect deadbodies. I told you.
  
W hat  
doesthat mean? W ehadto throw them on a cart.  Oneonthehead, one on the shoulders, 
one on the f eet, sh

, throw them  on a cart
, p
ref erably nakedbecause the clothing was 
valuable.  
 
 
And I will tell you something.  After 
you 
do this for a while 
instead of honoring the dead, respecting them, all you care
 
are about how heavy they are and 
how high you have to throw them .  You know what thatdoes to your soul

w

that youdon't even think about things like honoring a dead person?  Nothing. 
 
 
S o  lif e  in 
T heresienstadt
 
was blinded. It did have som ething 
which no other concentration camp had. Ithad a cultural level. T hey had musiciansup there.  
T hey hadpoets up there.  They had artistsup there.  And the Nazis l et them practice before 
they sentthem  to the gas cham ber.  I mean, this is a controversial type camp. T he Germ ans 
c a lle d  it  
ﬁ
Hitler gave the Jews a city to do what they wanted.
ﬂ
  
Yeah, that's right. They didn't. 
 
 
And theother little things,
 
which are not well
-
known
, th
e cit y wa s 
run by the Czech Jews
 a
nd run very well.  T hey had a mayor who was a Czech.  He was the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
one who was responsible.  He was the one who interf aced with theGerm ans.
  
W hy Im ention it 
is I have the greatest respectf or the Czechsexceptf or one thing. Those guys, being Czechs, 
blamed theGerman Jews for not having done enough to prevent Hitler com ing to power.  That, 
of  course, inthe eternal words of American 
slang 
is B.S. because itsim ply wasn't true. W e 
didn't do an
ything. W e couldn't have done. But the Czechs didn't care. T hey didn't care.  

T hey blam ed usf or the suffering they did becauseof  Adolph Hitler and the loss of their country 
in March of 1939. 
 
 
In 1943, the Germ ansrealized thatthey had to em pty the c
a m p .  
It's no longer possible to have these hundreds and hundreds of people in the camp withoutany 
decent m edical f acilities, f ood, and so forth. 
 
 
How m any of you take a shower a day
, p
ra c t ic a lly
?
  
I wa n t to  
see those hands. Ok. You're all very clean.  Supposing I'm telling you that you cannottake 

any shower anym ore,period! How would yo uf eel af ter a week? I'll gi ve it to

Dirt y!  Believe m e. T rust m e.  Youfeeldirty.  You feel sticky.  Youfeel unhappy with yourself . 
But that's whatthey wanted us tobe like. T hat's what they wantedus to be.  And we did.
 
 
So by 1943,they began toempty the cam p.T hey send1,000 
Jews, C zech, Germ anJews in a cattle car toAuschwitz or Birkenauand killed them.  And I 
becam e very worried that m y m other andm y stepfather would bealso

they called it 
resettlem ent. Germans are greatatf inding nam es.  Resettlem ent sounds innocent enough.  I 

m ean, this is very sim ple.  You have a big hurricane up here. And then you resettlepeople 
because you have to rebuildthe cityf irst. But everybody in the camp knew that resettlement

m eant death.  
 
 
How did we know? W e had no newspaper, no radio, no nothing.  
How did the camp know
 t
hat the word res
ettlem ent equates to death? 
  
I'll tell you how.  Very 
few Germ an SSpeople there.  Most of the guards who were guarding us were Czech who m  
the Germanshired to guard the camp.  Now
,  
that didn't mean these guys were in love with the 
Germ ans.  But they got 
something to eat.T hey got money.  They got a job. Sothey said, 
what thehell, I'm  going to work for the Germ ans regardless of how Ifeel.
  
 
 
But the Germans also used those young guards to escort the 
t ra i n s  from  
T heresienstadt
 
to Auschwitz.  And, of  course, it was Czechs saw the sm oke, 
sm elled the air, knew what happensat the ram p whenthey unloaded the poor people up there 

andm adethem  line up, wom enhere, children here,menover thereand soforth. They saw all 
of  that. And they didn't take long tof igurethat out.  But they came back to 
Theresienstadt
.  
Not liking the Germ ans, they told their buddies, the Czech Jews inside, don't you agree to 

resettlem ent becausewhat thatm eans, hereit is.  And they told them  what they experienced 
when they escorted those trains
 t
oAuschwitz and smelled the air and saw thef ireand soforth. 
 
So everybody in the cam p knew. 
 

 
Now, m y o wn lif e was this.  I was really wor ried.  My m other was 
not in goodhealth.  My stepfather was not ingood health.  I was wondering
 
what's going to 
happen.  How am I going to protect them ?  Iwasn't so much worried about myself . ButIwas 
worr ied about them .
 
 
Now, bear with m e. New chapter. The war in 1943had had 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

reached trem endous portions.  Your grandf athers, the Air Force and theBritish were bom bing 
thehell out of Berlin,day in andday out, at night theBritish, during the day the Americans. 
T he reasonI'm telling you this, because it com es together.
 
 
Am ong the buildings they destroyed was thebuilding where the 
S S  c h i ef  ha d

p, gone.  Now, af our
-
star general
 g
ot tohave a 
headquarters.  You would all agree.  My God, thepoor guy m ust have put hishead som eplace, 

his troops som eplace.  So they went to the Germ an Arm y and said I need a new headquarters. 
 
 
W hyam I telling you this?  Bear with m e. Com ing right around 
to  it.  
 
 
So, theGermans gave him  a piece of land, which is now that 
little town of W ulkow which Bill mentioned. And they said this is where I wantm y 
headquarters. And the Nazis, who were
 
supposedtobuild itfor him , came to 
T heresienstadt
.  
T hey said we need 250 volunteersto go there and build him  thatheadquarters, among them  

carpenters, plumbers, unskilled labors which I was, and soforth. Then they addeda sentence, 
and that's cruci
al. The sentence is, "
I
f you volunteer to go there
ﬂ 
--
 
because, am ong f riends 
here,nobody ever wanted to go to the SS recomm ended. Sonobody volunteered f ornothing.  

If you have good English.  So, in any case, they com eand said, " If you will volunteer

not
,"  
quote/unquote, 
" resettle your parents, your relatives in the cam p."  AndI bought that.  I 
said if  Idon't do anything

so I volunteered.
 
 
Andnow by the endof 1943, I was sent to that areatobuild that

I'm  going to cut it short.  I just want to tell you that in that labor cam p 
up there in that sub

, that, ladies and gentlem en, was thef irst tim e 
since 1933, since January
 
1933, that I wanted to die.  I had always told m yself I'
m n
ot  go i n g t o

sthe satisf action thatI will di e because I want to live until the world what 
happenedonce we're free.  Butnow I gave up.  
 
 
I don't have tim e to go into thehardship of that camp. But it was 
so bad thatI got very s ick.  By 1944, I was very sick.  I had something which is a vitam in 

def iciency disease, which is very ugl y because you get big blotchesover your body, the 
clothing sticks.  You get a high temperature. I said
:  
no m ore
;  
I can't, tim e'sup.  IfI go, I go.  
 
 
And as
 
I was standingandthinking that,I was one day
 
--
 
t h is  is  
a story.  I want you to follow m e.  I was standing on thebarbed wire fenceona Sunday looking 
out.W e're now talking about theend of 1944 or it could have beenJanuary of  1945. I don't 
rememb
er.  And therewas anotherprisonerwith m e.  And what we saw was thefollowing.  W e 
sa w 
--
 
outside the camp was a highway.  And on that highway we saw a track of  Germans 
going f rom  east to west.
 
 
Now, let m eexplain this to you. All during the war the Germans 
went f rom  west to east, conquering Poland, Hungary, Russia.  Now all of  a sudden the sam e 
Germ ans wentf rom  east to west.  I remem ber asking this guy, 
ﬁD
o you see this?
ﬂ
  
He said, 
ﬁY
eah, of  c
ourse I see this.

in the inside.  And I asked him ,"
W
ha t d o 
you 
m ake of this?"   He said, "
I
t's very sim ple. T he 
Germ ans aref leeing f rom  the Russians."  The Russiansaf ter Stalingrad, the 
B
at
tle  of 
Stalingrad, began to win the war.  And by now, by 1943, they had pushedthe Germ anArmy so 
far west thatthef irst Russians were entering theeasternmost province of Germany which no 
longer exists.  So If igured if  the Russians are that close, that the Germansare already f leeing, 
well, m aybe I can hang in a little bit longer.  And Idid. I survived.  And we were returned to 
T heresienstadt
. T hat cam p was never finished because the Russian Arm y came.  
 
 
W e were returned.  And we arrived there about February of 
1945.  My stepfather and m y m other were still alive.  For once the Nazis had kept their prom ise 
thatthey would not quote/unquote resettle them , and they were ali ve.  Andnow it was 
February
 
1945.  Andon the 5th of May, the Russian Arm y cam e and we were f ree.
 
>> Bill Benson: When did you know you were f ree? 
 
>> Bob Behr: W ell, the guards vanished. The SS guards vanished.  They were around allthe 
tim e. And allof  a sudden, sh
oo
p. They were never there. They saved them selves where they 
we n
t.  There was s
ort of  a period of  no
-
m an's land. T he Russians weren'there yet. The 
Germ ans were already gone.  There were only the Czechs who wer e justas happy that the 
Nazis had lef t.  Nobody knew. W ho's going tof eedus? W ho's going to take careof
 
us?  I 
m ean, the Nazis had ever ything organi zed. Thatorganization went to hell in a hand basket 

because there wasn'tanybody theretoenforce it. But it wasn't ver y long and the Russians 
cam e and tookover.
 
 
By the way, those combat troops, the Russians, were ver y good

T hey wanted all of our watches.  But we didn't 
have any watches anywa y.  They latertook it when we get to Berlin.
 
 
Anyway, that's how it happened

Af ter 12 years, to be sailing passedthe

m om ent you need to experience. W ords cannotdescribe it.  I don'tcare how good youare.  
It's ju st n o t th e re.

>> Bob Behr: T hey we re very weak.  Died shortly af terthe war, both of  them. They survi ve d,

which is another story because 
the Nazis had
 
occupied ourapartm ent. We had to chase thepeople out. 
  
So I got them  
resettled back there.  And I went off to America. 
  
W ell, I woundup inT exas, in Dallas,T exas.

$10. W ell, let me tell you how I got there. W earri ved in New York. W e 
were put up in thehotel.  And the next day or two we were intervie wed. And what I haddone 

in the meantim e, the distribution comm ittee, which was a Jewish comm ittee, had surveyed the 
Jewish com munities all over the United States and said
:  h
ow m any of  these refugees canyou 
take?  So when m y time cam e to be intervie wed, they asked me, 
ﬁW
hatdo you want to do?
ﬂ
  
Adding imm ediately, " you cannot stay in New York."   Yes, sir. 
 
 
So anyway, 
ﬁW
hat options do Ihave?
ﬂ
  
And they looked at the 
list and said, 
ﬁW
ell, you can either go to Dallas or you can go to Chicago. W heredo youwant 
to go?
ﬂ
  
I didn't have ablasted idea. W e were cut offf rom everything
, n
either about Chicago 
nor about Dallas. But I figured out
:  
l et  m e  see
; i
f  I goto Chicago, Igot to live with gangsters.  
If I go to Dallas,I got to live with Cowboys.  So that isthe lesser oftwo evils.  And guesswhat?

a ladies leatherfactory where they m adehandbags, belts. This is bef oreVelcro. So in those 
days you hadto glue things together. W hy am  Itelling you this? Because in them iddle of this 
damnfactory was a kettle with glue which had tobe stirred all the tim e so that the glue 
wouldn't get hard.  Guess who did the stirring.  So I sm elled bad. I hated that job.  
 
 
T hen I cam ehom eand the land lady

her nam e was Merrill

I ' ll 
never forget that. Shecouldnever distinguish thediff erencebetween Germ any and France 
because she kept calling m e" Frenchy."   So I was Frenchy.  I lived there.  I said that's really not 
the lif e I was hoping for. 
 
 
So her husband, Merrill's husband, worked intheoilf ields. They 
only cam e hom e 
over the weekend.  And what didhedo?  Idon't know how to describe it very 

well.  But those houses had aporcharound the upperf loor. You can go upstairs. T hat's
