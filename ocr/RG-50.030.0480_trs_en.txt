her -- her children very
 hard and very tight. And so was very

fa mily was also the very close sister of my 
mother, Sophia, and was not -- never ma rried, and 
was very hardworking person, and still was very
 intelligent lady who lik

opera, etcetera, etcetera. That™s was so me  part of
 fa mily where we was very ma ny ti mes with our 
si -- aunt in operas -- I know all operas for exam
ple in Wa rsaw, this was very nice place, very 
nice building, and that™s was for us pleas

governme nt people, for booths in opera, and nor
ma lly was booths for four people, and I was 
kids, ma ybe 12 years old, 10 - 12 
years old, I go like fifth one.  
Q: Aha. 

A: That™s wa s a pleasure and a good tul -- the best location, and you know, the voices were 

[indecipherable] opera very good be
cause international opera, and we reme mber this part very 
nicely. 

Q: Wa  -- when you describe your parents,
 your mother is th
e disciplinarian -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
4 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and you say your father was soft up to a certain point -- 

A: Up to a point. 

Q: Wa  -- explain what you mean. 

A: I mean this one, you know, you -- small thing my
 father not react, and our was very loving 
children, and dedicated to fa mily. And if so
me thing was very, very bad, or some body did 
some thing wrong to our fa mily, was very active, ve
ry powerful, because he was tall ma n, al most  
six foot, and everybody like him. Mean th -- no
t on -- only family and other people has a very 
[indecipherable] for my father. 

Q: Did you do things alone with your fath
er, did you go for walks with your father? 
A: Oh yes, sure -- 

Q: Yes? 

A: -- we -- that™s was a family affair. We live clos
e to Vistula river, and e
ach evening, if it™s not 
important other thing to do, we go all together, wa
lking ma ybe two miles close to Vistula river, 
we walk. And this time  was very popular walkin
g on this special sidewalk, white sidewalk near 
the Vistula river. Everybody go there, thousa
nd people going one way, other way, and -- and we 
go all the time with her father and mother. And th
en my father [indecipherable] now we must be 
[indecipherable] we mus t  walk. That™s was so
me thing -- something important. And during 
Sunday for example, was  very important for us, 
we go -- because we are 
Christian -- Catholic, 
we walk to ma ss during morning hours, Sunday. 
We  must be dressed, clean dressed, and -- you 

know, and Father and Mother and fo
ur children, we walk to church. After the ma ss we go mostly 
to old town, what for us was very -- fr om historic
al point of view, and also
 architectural point of 
view, because my father has very good taste, 
and -- I mean not only for eating taste, and for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
5 
 
 
seeing some  ma  -- structure, like buildings. Like
 for example dresses, or some thing thing and 
historical part, we go to [indeci
pherable] town and s -- we walk
 around and Father point out and 
this is this house, belong to
 these people, then the other pe
ople took some  [indecipherable] 
museum and so and so. In other words, created for us some thing what we call good taste for 
everything. That™s was my father, 
part. Mother, on other hand, was 
very close to my father and 
was one -- if I can say, one woma n what I can 
point like the best loving wife on her -- her 
husband. That was my -- my mother. And was whole 
time  doing everything what created better -
- good feeling for fa mily and good for character for 
us. That™s was my mot her, and I have very 
big respect for my mother on this part of the 
-- I wa s the oldest son, and I know ma ny different 
situation and I know one thing. My mother was be
st, loving, trustful wo
ma n for my father. 
Q: So they were very much in love? 

A: Oh, very much. And my father was very ha
ndsome  ma n, t a ll and very good ma nner that™s we 
like. Wa s not a -- a high education man, and bor
n with this feeling, everything must be good, 
perfect, and nice. Not both
er the other people. That
™s my feeling about it. 
Q: And wha t  did he do for a living? 
A: My -- I -- if I can answer 
you this, I must go back to mo ment where my father was during the 
World Wa r, first, was prisoner of the war, and 
was working four years during the war, arrested 
by German, and was four years in camp, where wa
s working 94 -- ni -- ni 
-- 19 -- 19 after Polish 
state, it was created. My father come  back fr
om the prison -- mean the farm prison, and come 
back to Wa rsaw, and start working aw -- eight 
-- for example, propa -- 
he was about 20 years 
old, working for state like Marines, on Vistula ri
ve r, because during this time, if you has -- are 18 

ye -- or -- year -- years old, you cannot create 
a good education, because was very tough during 
the sn -- Russian occupation. Russian occupati
on was everything against 
the education, not like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
6 
 
 
in other part of this time -- a other part of 
the Poland, li-ike Austria, or Germany, was much 
easier to educate that -- hi mself.
 In Russian part was not so easy, and my father c-come back 
from the ne -- I call this prison, and start workin
g, like I said before, fo
r na -- state, and start 
educated himself. I re member I was ma ybe five
 years old, I reme mber good, to our house each 
days or two days, came some student fr om the 
Polytechnical Institute, and give the technical 
instruction, technical edu
cation for my father for a couple year
s. In other words, my father was 
self-educated ma n. And was proba
bly good student, because resulted
 in his life was very, very 
successful. And later ther -- ni --
 my father, last time 1913 -- 30™s my
 fa ther start small business, 
knitting mill. And very small, and start growing, 
growing. And this part is
 very tight connected 
with ji -- Jewish people, because this part of 
the trade was mo stly maybe 60 percent in Poland 
was in -- in Jewish hand, Jewish
 trade. And from this point st
art the connection with a Jewish 
people who was located mostly in future ghetto, [i ndecipherable] and this part of the town and 

was, I can recall, businessma n.  
Q: Right, right. 
A: Small end businessman. 

Q: Businessma n. 

A: And 1930 -- ™39 start, you know, war, and my  fa
ther was more connected with Jewish people 
and special night before the w-war -- before
 the war -- ghetto uprising, because you know, we 
have two ghettos -- two uprising. 
Ghetto uprising and later th
e -- one year later, 1944 was 
Warsaw uprising where all nation and all Wa rsaw 
start fi ghting with the 
German, and that™s was 
place where, you know, we lost -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- quarter million people, you know, ther
e, also. That™s my father trade.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480

Q: Yeah. 
A: Now, what do you like to know more? 

Q: Did you work with him when you got a little bit older? 

A: Not -- later ther e -- 

Q: Later. 

A: -- and later there from 1942 -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- I was working with my father because up 
to the ™42, I was working for -- because in my 
school, high school, you mu -- before the war,
 you must know the other language. You not 
receive the gymnasium a pproval, in other word
s, diploma if you know 
other language -- if you 
don™t know other language, you are not pass. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: In other words, in my house, my sister was 
take the French. My brot
her, sister and me , the 
youngest sister, we took the German. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And each in our house speak -- my father 
speak Polish, German and Russian, and we speak 
Polish and German, and my do -- si
ster Irena speak fluently -- 
Q: French. 

A: -- French. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That™s wa s the requireme nts. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
8 
 
 
A: What we have not in this -- the United Stat
es, I am scared because my children learne d the 
French and now if you like ask for some  French -- 
Q: It doesn™t work. 

A: Not now. 

Q: Not any -- 

A: Anyway. 

Q: Right. Did you get along withyour brothers and sisters? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You™re the eldest, and -- 

A: I was the oldest, I see -- have
 not s-special problem with my
 youngest br-brother and sister 
and so during the time  -- my lifetime , I was ma
ybe -- my sister is ei
ght years older -- younger 
like me. In other words, I raise, almost, the gi
rl, and because this I have maybe more sympathy 
for my youngest system -- sister. And we call 
all the time  the [indecipherable] meaning young 
chil -- child in family. And it was favor for my 
mother, because -- and father, too, because was 

young. 

Q: Right. Did you like school? 

A: School?  

Q: Yeah, did you like it? 

A: Why not? 

Q: Yeah. A lot of kids -- 

A: This way you know -- you know a little bit more.  

Q: Right. 

A: Educated, sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
9 
 
 
Q: What was your favorite subject?  Did you ha
ve one -- when you were young, when you were -
- 
A: I -- su -- favorite subj
ect?  That™s was geography. 
Q: Geography, yeah. 

A: Geography was the best, histor
y and geography. And still I neve
r use this line 
I like only my -
- is not favor, only professional way, was technica
l. I was future in -- I finish polytechnical -- 
[indecipherable] Polytechnical In
stitute in Wa rsaw University. 
And that™s was for money, for 
[indecipherable]. And history and geogra
phy was my hard part of the subject. 
Q: Yeah, right. 

A: And that™s -- we was travel all over the wo
rld, after we educated 
our children, who are the 
best children in the world, and especially in Am
erica, where raise the children was very, very 
hard. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And we were suc -- successful an
d thank to God we have good children. 
Q: Right. 
A: One boy, one girl.  

Q: You like sports -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- very much, yes? 

A: Maybe too much. 

Q: Maybe too much?  Wh y? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
10 
 
 
A: Maybe too much, because you know the di-different story, this time , 1930 -- 1930 -- up to 
™39, there, if you are good sportman, you can die because you have nothing to eat. You not even 

make -- not make money. 

Q: Right. 

A: Here in America, that™s -- for sportsma
n is good place. If you are good sportsma n, you can 
have better life. For example, in academi c time 
I  was, up to the 18 years old, I [indecipherable] 
up to the 1939 war, I was in academi c  team playing the basketball, and I was short. And I was 

good shooter, and was some time too much I -- my fath
er was very upset because I not learn what 
I supposed to do, and I spent more time  fo
r sport. And so I understand this, and so 
[indecipherable] everything was straight now, and al
so my sports part [indecipherable] I like and 
I was playing all the time my life, up to 75 year
s old before -- after a --
 up to the operation, my 
heart operation, I play tennis, a
nd I like very much. And also [i
ndecipherable] subjects -- subject 
was I was in team where we are -- academic 
team where we [indecipherable] you know, eight 
people and for example, I was f -- on the [indeciph
erable] in the first pa
rt. And that™s was only 
two, three years, because  that war and [indecipherable] so -- 

Q: Right, right. Tell me  some thing. Was -- was th
 -- was there in your house a certain kind of 
political consciousness as you grew up, 
in your discussions around the table? 
A: Yes, oh yes, we -- we was all the time a very 
political fami ly. Why? Because my parents gr ow 
and grandparents grow in atmosphere where 
we was -- where the people like free Poland. 
[indecipherable] Poland was divi
ded by three parts German, Au
strian and Russia, and was 
fighting and was simpatic for freedom of the Pola
nd. In other words, this part, my parents bring 

to our house. My parents discuss all time  political
 part. And to you political mean we was very 
tight to our history, to 
our freedom, and my parents was very
 like, have the right freedom for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
11 
 
 
Poland, and that™s we was discuss we move. In our
 house was all the time two or somet i me three 
newspaper, different point of view. And sh -- 
we know -- try have the opinion, the right level 
opinion, not only one side. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And we never be anti-Polish, for example, and 
we never was on the left 
or the right side take 
the position. And we raised this
 way and we was good Polish citizen. 
Q: You have said that when your father went in
to his business, you began to have more of an 
association with Jewish people -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- or at least your father did. When you were 
going to school, were there Jewish kids in the 
school as well as Polish Catholic kids, or -- 

A: You see -- yes, I have couple -- ne -- not many, because you see, we was not too rich people. 

Before, the educated children was very costable
. And one time in our fa
mily was four children, 
and you mus t  pay the tuition. And before the war,
 it was not so easy. Each child costs, for 
example in gymnasium,  mean the high school
, was private high school, and was state high 

school. If you cannot go to state high school, you 
must pay. And this costs this time , 80 zloty, 
and fellow who work in the bank, like [indecipherab
le] or fellow who work in the post office, 
take only 200 dollars mo n -- monthly. And you 
must pay for one child 80 zloty. And I was 
ma ybe lucky because my parents pa id for me  onl
y part of this, because I was good student, and 
happened I pay less. And my two sister and br
other, that™s was big money monthly, pay for 
education. And my father did pay and my mother
 said, I don™t need fur coats, I don™t need 

nothing, I need good, education children.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: I -- I asked you -- I™m going to go back to a co
uple of things, but the last question I asked you 
was about your association with Jewish kids wh
en you were in school, in -- in elementary school, 
and high school. We re there Jewish kids 
in the high school, or did -- or --  
A: In elementary school, yes. Only was tw
o in this area, was not a Jewish area -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- because you know in Wa rsaw, a 
part -- the Jewish Warsaw located
 mostly in one part of the 
Warsaw. The north part na -- clos
e to Narlefki and this area. A
nd where I live, I live close to 
Vistula river, was not ma ny Jew, and s -- Je
wish pe ople, and still was two young guy who was 
up to twa -- 14 years old, we was together in
 school, and you know, was very nice guy, on -- 

poor, and still was [indecipherable] this young people
 go to Palestine. And up to si -- 14 years 
old, this fellow has education, a
nd later they both are interest in
 go to Palestine and be some  
carpenter or some  mecha nical 
some thing like this. And that™s 
was stop my  connection with the 
Jewish young person. And still sa -- we was invi
ted to later there, I maybe me ntioned to 
Melami d family, where was on Bar Mitzvah and etce
tera. That™s connection fa mily who is jewi -
- our family with Jewish fa mily in the same 
branch, the same  business, the same  trade. And 
during the high school time, was not
 ma ny Jews, mostly it was like 
Catholic and the Protestant, 
not Jewish young people. In other words, this tim
e, up to ™39, in school was not close connection 
to young Jewish people. On the m- mem -- part of 
my fa mily, from 1930 to 19 thir -- near ™42 - 
™44, na -- we was connected very closely to coup
le fa mily, Jewish fa mily in the Wa rsaw ghetto. 
And special after 1939, the -- some family from W
ilno move d to Wa rsaw, a Jewish family wo -- 
who moved to Wa rsaw, and name  ca
ll Epstein, and we was close, and very important for us this 
time, we na -- was family name Melami d. Was t hr
ee kids, and two g -- brot
hers and a girl, and a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
14 
 
 
Melami d family and grand fa mily of Melami d wa
s Birnbaum. And he was very close, and still 
was a business connection and my father was couple
 time s -- was very -- like I said before, he™s 
ver -- was very nice, honest ma n, and was call for some  arrangement, some discussion, not only 
discussion, it was business people, but be
 Catholic and Jewish. And to wa -- 
Q: A problem, you me a n?  Some  si -- 

A: A problem, some  -- 

Q: -- problems ?  

A: Right. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And before go to the court,
 these people created some  -- hone
st people from one side and 
other side, and dissolved the problem, in other wo
rds, straightened the pr oblem. My fa ther was 
called like the judge. In other words, Jewish peop
le try -- know Father was honest and Catholic 
was thinking my father was honest pe
rson. That™s was our connection. And -- 
Q: And was this in the 30™s, before the ghet -- 
A: No, this was -- 30™s - 30™s.  

Q: In the 30™s. 

A: Now the 19 -- from 1939, that™s was little bit 
different situation because start created ghetto 
concentration camps in Poland. 

Q: Right. 

A: And for example, the concentration camp, very important thing. In Poland was, before the 

war, three and a half m- million Jewish people. The biggest  concentration in Poland -- in Europe. 

Mean was for Jewish people, was some  chance be
tter like in Germany or France. And German 
know this after the war, and before too, the big 
concentration Jewish people in Poland, that™s, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
15 
 
 
from my poi nt of view, was created and yet -- 
and German created so ma ny concentration camps 
in Poland. One of the important  concentrati
on camp was Auschwitz. The Auschwitz was built 
first couple weeks after a wa
r was [indecipherable] 1939, and first prisoner was not Jewish 
people, was Catholic people. And which one Catho
lic people?  All professo
rs from university. All 
the lawyers, engineers, and cler
gy wa s sent first to concentration camp, Auschwitz. That™s first 
there was only Polish people was ther e, and was not
 directly kill, only hard labor creat ed the 
deaths. 1941 start Jewish people 
there, and start the death camp. 
Concentration camp that™s the 
one part, people dying because was overwork. And death camp, was sent there and killed.  
Q: Right. 

A: That™s wa s the di fferent and this must be stra
ight, because I was in concentration camp, not in 
Auschwitz, only in Flossenbürg, that™s was politi
cal prison during -- before the war ™39, where 

Hitler put all opponents, own party, to concen
tration camp. Many German people was there, 
that™s was political prison. And th
at™s my own concentration camp.  
Q: Right, right. 

A: But we talk later about it. 

Q: Later we™ll talk about that. 
Let -- let™s -- let™s go -- go ahea
d, I don™t want to interrupt you, go 
ahead. 

A: Ah yes, you ask me  I -- I have ma ny f -- I ha
ve not very close friend, and I -- Jewish people 
this time  before -- during school, because in
 a class was 40 people, 50, and was two Jewish 
people, you know. And was living 
in different pl ace, like we -- and we not have close 
connection. And still we seem the same , Polish c
itizen, has the same  right like we Catholic, 

Protestant or Muslim, because was couple Muslim too. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
16 
 
 
A: We have the same -- and I feel this -- I wa
s raise in the same  feeling, who because you must 
know and I am sure you know, the Polish Cons
titution was the second in the world after 
American Constitution, and it is the same C
onstitution, freedo m from eve r yth -- everybody. 
Q: Did -- wh-when you were growing up in Poland 
as a kid, before the wa r, did you experience 
people expressing anti-Se mitism?  Did you -- di d you understand that there was a di fference? 
A: You know si -- you know si -- this is big word.  

Q: Yes, I understand. 

A: A big word, a big question. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I live -- I born there, and my race is this tim
e there. And the feeling was not anti-Semitic so 
much -- some people, yes. Like the J-Jewish peop
le has m- more educated in this time -- part -- 
part, not all, because if we talking about the Je
wish, we must divide -- and the problem is, we 

must divide between -- up to bu
car -- Vistula river we
st, and Vistula river eas
t. Vistula river west 
was not big su -- problem. We st -- excuse me , 
east, was mostly people very sympatic to 
Communist regime . Socialist Comm
unist regime . On the west part of the Poland, I mean, from 
the Vistul a ri ver, was little differ -- di fferent and was fr om German idea anti-Semitic, and was 

not catch all of nation. Was only ma -- some  small 
part. On east Poland was very big, torrential 
Communist ideology. And I lose my -- 

Q: We ll, I think what I -- what I was asking 
you is, given th -- when -- when people live 

separately, and in ma ny soci
eties they do this, yes? 
A: Right. 

Q: So that children are often raised to think -- 

A: Oh, excuse me , that™s I -- I not feel --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
17 
 
 
Q: Yes, okay. 
A: -- now you remi nd me. Mostly wa s a economical 
problem. And that™s -- if
 we call this anti-
Se mitism, that™s wrong. That™s was economical. 
Jewish people was hardworking, s-stood close 
together and was the same  token, more successf
ul. And Po -- Polish people, specially on -- on the 
east, was more lazy, like all the Russian this ti
me. Not produce so much, not educated so much. 
And start the different between Jewish more ed
ucated and -- and born on 
the east part of the 
Poland, mor e  lazy and more -- not created. So -- 
and that™s was all time the different economical. 
Not only anti-Semitic -- I understand, because 
you are Jewish, you are no good. You are a Polish 
-- Polish, you are good -- you are good. And question 
is, economi cal -- the answer is economical 
base. That™s if some body called the anti-Semitism, th
at™s not right. I not feel this way. Was some 
people was, from the point of view. This is -- Je
wish mean this fellow is different like we are, 
because the fellow has [indecipherabl e] the fellow 
has the factory, the fellow working hard. And 
ss -- that™s not ss -- for me  it™s not ss -- right. 
What I understand before the war, that™s was only 
different on eco -- economi cal
 base, not religion.  
Q: So you don™t think that there was some  kind of 
difference based on the fact that Jews believed 
differently than Cathol
ics or Protestants? 
A: No, I don™t think so, I don™t think so. I -- I a --
 race, you know, but to different people -- in my 

class, for example, was ma ny -- not ma ny, c
oupl e, Protestants. Nobody never talk about 
[indecipherable] feel this way, I 
feel other way. Generally speaking, 
like I said before, this was 
economical base in Poland.  

Q: Okay, so let me  ask you some thing. When Hitler come s to power in 1933 -- 

A: Yes? 

Q: -- between ™33 and ™39, before the war -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
18 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- there is a rise of Fascism,
 or the right in Poland as well. 
Am -- am I not correct? There was 
-- 

A: Before the war, was -- for me  was not so popu
lar start argume nt and fi
ghting with the Jewish 
people, it was not popular. Some  part of student 
in university created so
me, we are against the 
Jews who are educated in our university, because
 Jewish are 10 percent of the population, and in 
our class are 40 percent the Jewish people,
 educated by state. That™s economical 
[indecipherable]. And all some  stude
nt who said Jewish in our clas
s supposed to be 10 percent, 
not 40 percent. And now you can call how you like, Anti-Semitist, or  econo mi cal 

[indecipherable]. You see, that
™s the very big question. 
Q: Do you think that the nume rous
 clauses that was put into eff
ect, the nume rous clauses, which 
didn™t allow as many Jewish students as
 before was a function of economi cs? 
A: Economi cal -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- because some  poor  guys -- as -- very sm
art, cannot go to university because there was 
already, for example, 40 percent Jewi sh people.And this guy was [indecipherable] not me ?  Why 

I cannot go there?  You see, that™s
 the story. You must look both wa
ys. And still I have very big 
respect for -- this time, for Jewish parents, 
try and pay for education own children. That™s I 
me ntion [indecipherable] we must look after Jewi
sh people. And take the sample, educate it own 
people. And this time , in Poland, ma ny people no
t think this way. And Jewish people was ahead, 
educated own children. That™s the very important. 

Q: So let me  ask you some thing. So when you™re 
-- when Hitler come s to power in Germany -- 
A: Yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
19 
 
 
Q: -- were you very conscious 
of what™s going on, is it --  
A: Oh sure. 
Q: -- is -- did the papers ha
ve a lot of stuff, it™s -- 
A: We -- we look all a moment -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- Hitler, and we were so upset. Why di
d friends, or British not do some thing? 

Q: Right. 

A: And Hitler grow, and you know, expend -- that™s 
was our -- na -- is interesting. We  look -- I 
said before, two, three newspaper daily. 

Q: Right. 

A: And we know, and each as -- from us, es
pecially young pe ople like me was thinking, we 
supposed to be the people who are honest, 
and people who are fair for everybody. He -- old 
people thinking, no, we are looking 
a little bit for right side. I wa
s more liberal, after I grow up 
and I know a little bit more, I wa
s little bit more towards cente
r. And Hitler was created, you 
know, the situation, people start ta
lking about the Jewish problem,
 and it™s a -- etcetera. And not 
ma ny peopl e supported this idea, what I know. 

Q: Mm-hm. Right. 

A: Some  crazy guy at left or ri
ght, that™s was not my idea. I tr
y balance in my life opinion. And 
still Hitler did the worst part what happened to
 Jewish people, Polish people and other people 
who was lost life in concentra
tion camp and death camp. Tha t ™s what happened right now, and I 
not see in the newspaper in America right now 
mention how ma ny peopl e die, how they this or 
this. And now the German raise like big nati
on and -- and are successful, and our people in 
America, in Poland, are depress. That™s 
my feeling. That™s my [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480

Q: When di -- you talked about 
eating meals with y -- the whol
e family. Did you eat breakfast, 
lunch and dinner with the 
fa mily? All three meals? 
A: Yes. 
Q: All three meals? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So is it -- 

A: No, we would -- in Poland was 
differently to [indecipherable] 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Eight -- seven o™clock was 
breakfast very quick, very quic
k, and we go to school, and ni -- 
later there we  come  back, three o™ cloc k, and fi
ve o™clock was dinner. 
And during dinnertime, 
everybody was supposed to be near 
table. That™s -- we -- with my wife, doing the same way. Our 

children was raised the same  ti me . During the me
als, we sup -- special evening, six or fi ve 
o™clock, we supposed to be toge
ther and we eat and we disc
uss and we change our opinion. 
That™s very important thing, because this wa
y father know what the children think, children 

know what father think. And they -- some  idea,
 you know, left, right, was created, because I 
heard the other person opinion. That™s was ve
ry -- and was and is important for fami l y 
connection. 

Q: Right. And did people in your fa
mily have different viewpoints? 
A: Oh sure di -- 

Q: Yes? 

A: -- absolutely, absolutely, sp
ecially my daughter, all time. 
Q: No, I meant -- I don™t mean your 
daughter, I don™t mean -- I didn™
t me an after the war. I mean 
in -- in the 30™s, when you 
are a little bit older -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
21 
 
 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- and you can understand more. 

A: Yes, we was raise this 
way, everybody has own opinion. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And own opinion, mo stly the young people has na -- opinion little bit,
 now how I can say?  
Little bit left. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Liberal. Old people are going 
through whole life and see what 
happened, and said no, the true 
is in the mi ddle. And you know, that™s was -- la
ter there we also go to m- mi ddle you know, and 
we think that™s the right way. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You mus t  think about the other fellows, ot
her opinion, other idea, and that™s way we was 
raised. 
Q: And were you afraid of wa
r?  Did your fa mily think -- 
A: Oh everybody -- everybody are afraid to war, if some body know what mean the wa r. 
Q: But were you specifically afraid that Germa
ny would attack Poland?  Did your parents talk 
about this or not? 

A: No, afraid you sa -- afraid, that™s one thing. 
If you are young people s-soldiers -- soldier, I 

was in this time  soldier, you are all time a f
raid, because you know Ger man was equipped with 
better i -- equipment, better tr
ained and so and so, and Pola
nd was less equipped. And so 
[indecipherable] knows. And that™s war. And specia
lly if you talking about
 the war, really not 
war, from east after the agreemen
t between Hitler and Stalin, a
nd take France and start -- give 
our back knife in the other back, that™s different
 story and start [indeciphe
rable] there, and KGB 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
22 
 
 
and so and so. You see, that™s -- that™s terror. 
Wa r, that™s one thing. Te
rror, that™s 
little bit 
different. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know, and we have experienced worse, fr
om the east big political terror, and fr om the 
west big advance equipped army. And we we
re s -- Poland was betw
een these two big -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- parties. 

Q: Right. 

A: And wer -- personally, if you ask me  what is
 good, better, German or
 the Soviet, I -- I put 
equal. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: One and the other one kill own people like Stalin 20 millions, and this part kill our people. 

Q: Uh-huh, right. 
A: That™s -- that™s -- we will look from this pint
 -- part [indecipherabl e]. Well, anyway, ma ybe -- 
Q: Okay, you finished high school in May of 1939? 
A: In 1939 May, and I was drafted to -- I was 18 
years old, I was drafted 
to -- that™s was the 
popular situation. After you finish high school, y
ou have diploma, you must work -- you must go 
to army for free, not for pay, for free for two years. 

Q: And that™s every boy? 

A: Every boy, every boy. 

Q: And the girls had no obligation? 

A: Girl, last two years was something -- 
prepare for military like we did. And the 

[indecipherable] during the high school™s time , 
two years we have -- we call [speaks Polish

23 
 
 
here], prepare for the army duty. An
d we know how operate, you know, the guns 
[indecipherable] during the -- the war, if [indeciph
erable] and that™s what 18 -- 16 to 18 years old 
the gir -- gir -- boy did. 

Q: And was that during this regular school 
hours, or there -- wa
s that after school? 
A: No, no, during -- 

Q: It was part of the school? 

A: Right. Only one time  weekly. One time week, on We dnesday. 

Q: So what did -- what did you lear
n?  You learned how to use a gun? 
A: Like you use the gun, organizatio
n di -- in the army, and equipment and so on and so on. And 
later, if you finished and graduated from hi
gh school, you have gymnasium
 diploma. You must 
know the other language and you must go through the [speaks Polish here] to military. And these 

people was already like me, sent to mili -- ni --  to
 military unit where we -- for we pr epare the -- 

our border with Germa ny, 1939, for three months, fo
r free. Later there, af
ter three months, we 
was automa tically -- supposed to automa tically 
be  sent to one year military school for future 
officer, army officer, like We st Point, you see,
 and only We st Point is more graduated, you 
know, that™s like half West Poin
t education, something. That™s 
not the same  [indecipherable]. 
And 1939 I was after do -- received the -- a diploma,
 I was se nt to a unit where we fortified our 
border and after three months we supposed to be 
transferred to a military
 school, and start war. 
17
th
 September, the Soviets invade Poland, and I wa
s in a unit where we relocated there. And 20 
-- pe -- probably two, three da
ys after the Soviet invade in
 Poland, we was ma  -- surrounded by 
army -- Soviet army tanks, and after small shooting, we supposed to surrender. Our officers was 

on one side, the other people -- sold
ier on other side. And officer sent
 later there to concentration 
camp, and death camp to [indecipherable] 15,000 of
 Polish officer was killed, you know. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
24 
 
 
was lucky, because I -- first night we was in barr
ack, were -- we were supposed to be selected 
later then I give my watch and 20 zloty and dur
ing night six people escape. We  was not count, 
yet.  
Q: Right. 

A: And we was [indecipherable] if 
we not do now, we da -- later th
ey™ll be to -- too late. And -- 
Q: I™m going to have to stop you, we have to change the tape. 

A: All right. 

Q: So we™ll continue this 
story when we come  back. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: You -- you talked about being 
captured by the Soviets, yes? 
A: Right. 
Q: And then, y-you didn™t know, of course, what
 happened to the officer
s. Did yo -- did you -- 
A: I know was separate fr om us, and was -- 

Q: But you didn™t know then what they were going to do. 

A: Oh no, no. 

Q: No. 

A: That™s --  that™s was later, half year later.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: After half year, the -- you know, Stalin -- 

Q: Right. 

A: Beria, and other Communist 
leader sign death for these peopl
e who was created Polish army. 
Q: Right. 

A: You see, what happened, if you look to hist
ory back, 1920, the Soviet army go west and try 
connect ru -- Soviet army  with Germa n -- si
x million German Communists. And Poland was on 
the way. And this time , Polish army -- voluntary 
army, stop the big, big army Soviet in -- near 
the Wa rsaw. And Stalin was the pol
itruck there in his front, Polish™s front and reme mb er the so 

big army wa s stop by very small army not orga
nize, voluntary army. And the Soviet must go 
back. And Stalin reme mber this, in own books
 mention, never forgot Poland stop invade S-

Soviet [indecipherable] through 
the Germany. And that™s the r
eason was created the Katyn and 
the all intelligentsia, all officer
, all top generals was killed in
 Katyn, because Stalin reme mber 
what these people did for S-Soviet Comm
unist invasion in the Germany, etcetera. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
26 
 
 
Q: Now in -- w-when they captured you, and they
 separated the -- the officers, how many of you 
were they -- were you, kids
 who were not officers? 
A: No. 
Q: You were all 18 year 
old and 19 year old -- 
A: 19 years old. 

Q: -- you just graduated. So how ma ny of you?  A few hundred? 

A: Oh, that™s was couple company -- 

Q: Couple -- uh-huh. 

A: -- you know, a couple company was -- 

Q: So it was pretty big. 

A: Yeah, yeah. That™s -- it was a -- 
and between us was ma ybe 2000 people --  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- you know, that™s -- that™s so
me thing. I-In this part where I was capture, was less, because 
the company was spread. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I don™t know what happened with the 
other. And -- wa s couple hundred people. 
Q: Right. 

A: You know. 

Q: And wha t  ma de you decide to bribe the germa -- the -- 

A: Because I -- before -- because
 I read three newspaper, I know
 what me an the Communist who 
are -- Communist in the book is very
 nice. Practically bur -- talki
ng, the east part, this is Asian 
people, and all time talking differently, doing 
differently, and you never know what happen. 
That™s -- I wa s scared. And people who was with
 me  in the same  company, know is only right 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
27 
 
 
now chance, take our dresses and insignia what
 was -- because the rifle was already gone, 
because was taken by Russian, and escape. We  kn
ow about, we must do this. We  was prepare 
me ntally. There is not good. There i -- west is
 not good, east is no good. We 
must survive. That, 
you know, I give him wa tch, a -- this time for So
viet, have the watch, that™s was drim. And I 
have 20 dollar -- 20 zloty, was nice m- money, because 
p -- my parents give me before I go there. 
And we escape, was six people. 
Six people and two go north, to L
itvah, and two go -- we go to 
Warsaw, and two go to east. And this go t -- well
, go to east probably, I never heard about it, or 
probably was killed or some thing. Two go -- go nor
th, because this part 
was close to Vilnos, 
couple hundred kilome ter from Warsaw. And th
ese two guys, one of the was very famous 
general in Poland, son, go to Litvah and later th
ey fight in English -- go through the Litvah to 
[i ndecipherable] Estonia, and go to Sweden, and 
later there fi ght like offi cer in Navy -- British 
Navy. And three -- two guys walk from there thr
ough the forest and etcetera, to Wa rsaw. And the 
way -- like we walk was not so easy, because 
you must know, between German and Lithuanian 
was some thing close, mean German talk to Li
thuanian nationalist who work later, therefore 
German like not Gestapo, only military unit, 
and was against the Poland. Very against the 
Poland. Sma ll country, very against the Poland. And 
after Soviet destroyed our army from east, 
these people, Lithuanian -- not 
all, and mostly, was very upset
 about the Polish army. And I 
myso -- we must walked -- walk to Warsaw dur
ing night because on the -- in the forest, I saw 
myself, ma ny officer hanging, by Lithuanian. A
nd without the boots, you know. In other words, 
we was scared. That™s wa s scare. Because 
you never know where you go. We  cannot go through 
the village, because [indecipherable] scared of 
the village was checkpoint, checkpoint created by 
Polish Communists, and check you everything, and you know, you never know, you can go to -- 

later they arrest and go to Si
beria. And between these people 
with a red band, was ma ny Polish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
28 
 
 
poor guy who was created, who wa
s Communist and ma ybe J e wish
 people, poor Jewish people 
too, who think [indecipherable] new area, you -- 
a new life because everybody be free. Fine, be 
free, only not raise up to free, mean to mi ddle 
class. Only turn down 
-- everybody down. And the 
people was thinking that the ri
ght way, and was wrong. And to me  going back, we -- to Wa rsaw, 
we must be careful where we are going.  

Q: So where did you -- 

A: That™s 800 miles -- kilome ter. 

Q: 800 kilome ters. So you walked at night -- 

A: Right. 

Q: And you slept during the day, but where did 
you sleep, did you hide, did you do some thing? 
A: We try e -- this area was so
me  pe ople who are Polish citizen and the same  token not only 
Polish citizen, was Polish characters. In other 
words, if we knock down -- knock to the door, and 
we -- the people see we are in uniform, give us
 sleep, give us some thing to eat, was not much, 
and -- little bit. And give us a
ddress where we supposed to go -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- and meet other guy help us. That™s was the 
reason we were very slow from September to 
end of de -- December, we walk 700 kilome ters 
by foot. And before we cross borderline on the 
river Bug, some  big river, we was waiting when 
we can cross there, because there was German 
and here was the bol -- the Soviet. And we was 
almost two weeks waiting on the -- close to the 

river Bug, and we was working for far mers. Farm
ers this time was -- Polish farmer pick up the 
potato. And we pick up the potato, and I never did 
this job. I was terrible had, because you know, 
was very hard to do this, all the time  in this position. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
29 
 
 
A: And stay there. We  work there two weeks, 
and one day the farmer [indecipherable] says eat, 
and money a nd -- that™s the Polish farmer. And 
we crossed the river B
ug. Couple days we was 
waiting, ma ybe we cross today, in wa ter up to knee. 

Q: So you -- you walked across the river, up to your knee it was? 

A: Yes, w-water was up to knee, and we must pi
ck up the time, the fellow on the other side, the 
German, not  shoot us. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Well anyway, after two -- Dece
mber -- during December, before the Christma s, we -- I reach 
Warsaw and see the house was destroyed, partially 
destroyed, and we start terrible life during the 
oc -- German occupation. 

Q: Right. Let me  -- let me ask you some thing. 
As  you™re -- as you™re walking, obviously once 
you get into Poland, and the part that the German
s had, was there a lot of
 destruction that you 
saw, all over? 
A: Oh yeah, y -- all over the section. Not like was after the war -- 
Q: After the war, 
yeah, yeah, right. 

A: -- not the war™s destruction. 
And you see that, for me  was very
 different feeling. I saw Polish 
army because I was there. I was Soviet army wh
o was very poor equipped. And a-after I cross 
the river, I saw the German ar my, what wa
s equipped very good, and the people are, you know, 
good looking in the uniform, because German put 
all the money not in the bread, and not in the 
butter, only put every -- on ma ny -- every penny to
 military. And that™s was first my  shock. 
Three army, three di fferent situation. And later 
where I saw third army, Am
erican army, that -- 
Q: When you saw the Germans, you know, 
seeing how well equipped they were -- 
A: Very equ -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
30 
 
 
Q: -- did that ma ke you very nervous? 
A: Oh su -- no -- 

Q: Bec -- because it -- 

A: -- that™s was ans -- I receive 
the answer. We  - -  like, Poland 
cannot win the war with army like 
that one. After I walked and I saw first the Ge
rman army. Tha t ™s was different feeling. Was a 

very powerful army. Later there you know, France, Poland -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- fight longer -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- like France and the [indecipherable] and you 
know, give everything. That™s -- I ha -- I have 
nothing respect for French army, abs olutely. Is
 very big zero. [indecipherable] Maginot, you 
were no good to us. Equip millions, millions dolla
rs, and g -- was givi
ng for nothing. Not fight. 
And Poland has not a line of Maginot or some thi
ng like this, and fight. And right now we have 
some thing else. We ll, anyway -- 

Q: We re -- were you very pessimi stic when youcame back to Wa rsaw?  You si -- your fa mily 

was okay, you came and you saw that the f -- 

A: Yes, ma ybe -- 

Q: -- your family was all right. 

A: -- young fellow -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- all the time is homesick. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
31 
 
 
A: Right?  You are army, first time  out of the 
family, you thinking all the time about fa mily. You 
know, I saw there, and you know wa
s not other way. I cannot go in ot
her place, I mu st stay with 
fa mily in Warsaw. Sure I was upset and I know
. This time maybe we know so much what kind 
German can do for your nation. Later then it wa
s, you know, shooting. After two, three weeks, I 
was on the Warsaw street, each da y was some
 execution you know, and pe
ople say a different 
execution, a loud talk [polish] 
polska, free -- freedom for Poland. That™s -- you know what the 
German did?  Put the gypsum in your mouth be
fore you were shot. Not voice [indecipherable] 
Q: They cut? 

A: No, they put i-in your 
mouth before execution -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- put in your mouth gypsum. 

Q: Is that  tape?

German can shoot you. And very hard it was from
 beginning, take the 
job, because was no job,

German giz -- who or -- was on the tower, and 
has a reflector, saw some thing happened and put 

the reflector there, and start shooting, becau

gold you have bread. And come bac k to the moment, the guy -- German from the top start 

shooting this way. And my bed was on the other room, big room against this wall where was the 
dead body. And dead body was up to six foot high. 
And this body take the

And I tell to you one important th

ghetto was worst. Wa s worst, because there wa
s not only food, people are tryi ng to be animal 
one to other. Take the bread because you die an
yway, take the bread. In concentration camp was 
not so. People was hungry and in ghetto was wo
rse situation than concentration camp.

 or ganization was in you -- you neighbor. And 
most important thing, don™t talk
 about, don™t ask about this. 
Q: Right.

of the underground?  Did you go to somebody that

52 
 
 
Q: Ca me  to you? 
A: Ca me  to me  and then on, and specially in the 
same  age, then on we have some thing like this, 
some  idea like this, and we supposed to be. Th
at was the connection. And later there you said 

yes, or -- or not.  

Q: And did you know this -- you knew this person, but did you know the group that he was -- 

A: [indecipherable] this pers
on and generally this idea, because I know only three person.  
Q: Right. 

A: And the organization was -- 

Q: Wa s large. 

A: -- couple thousand people in, for example. 

Q: But did it ma tter to you, si
nce there were different undergro
unds with different politics? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: So did it ma tter to you?

Only later there, after X number years, the 
politic go together to one group, beca
use this way is more power -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- [indecipherable] some thing, and this was th
e head over everything, a
ll different idea was 
Ar mi a Krajowa. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Ho me  army.  

Q: Right. 

A: You know, who would fighting against the Ge rman. 

Q: And is -- is -- is that the group that you we
re with at first, ar
my -- Ar mia Krajowa? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
53 
 
 
A: No, that™s was before different name , a
nd later there comb ined to Armi a Krajowa. 
Q: So what did you do?  What did they ask you to do? 
A: First was thousand different ma  -- way you can
 help, you can do against the German. First, 
you can be na -- sabotage guy, and not ma ny wa
s like this. Not ma ny. And enough German, as 
you know [i ndecipherable] problem, was a sabotage 
and some was, for example [inde cipherable] 
news printing, delivery paper for example, distribution paper. Was so ma ny point -- y-young 

people special was help to this organization. 

Q: There was -- there were a lo
t of underground newspapers, yes? 
A: Oh yeah, sure. Small paper, each day some th
ing new, what happened 
at west point -- west 
front, what happened in east -- 
in east Poland -- east front. An
d you know that™s keep the people 
happy, and s -- 

Q: How did people get the newspapers, si
nce clearly you couldn™
t openly sell it? 
A: Oh no, of course -- 
Q: So how did -- how did you -- how did people get it? 
A: It was many different way. The people -- so
metime the people bring you one or two pieces 
the newspaper. Some  pe ople distribute thousand 
right now. And for example, mother with small 
children --  child in the carriage be s -- below this
 has so muc h paper [indecipherable] paper, and 
distribute this in germa -- from beginning don™
t know nothing about this
, and you know, if we -- 
conspiracy, you know [i ndecipherable] is good or
ganize that™s be close and no ma ny people 
know about this. That™s happened during the wa
r in Poland, organize and you know, and the top 
was mostly the officer -- army officer who was 
not killed, who was not 
in -- in a camp, and 
organize, and the other thing was very
 good prepare, you know, that™s life. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
54 
 
 
A: If you do some thing wrong, you risk your life 
and your friends. And was good organize, and -
- up to mo ment where we  -- who was the -- the Warsaw uprising and before the Wa rsaw 
uprising, the -- two weeks, the radio from Moscow
 -- M-Moscow, call Polish 
people si -- take the 
arms , and fi ght with German, who moving with 
-- and people was, you know, a -- very excited 
and special young people. And afte
r up -- Wa rsaw uprising start, the Soviet stop talking about 
this. And whole tragedy who was wars -- in Wa rsaw uprising, where we lose over 200,000 

people, more Wa rsaw lose during 80 -- 63 days
, more people like American army during the 
World Wa r second lose. 200,000 -- over 200,000 war -- Wa rsaw lose people, and killed, and 

American armi es, 175,000. Lose for whole war. M
ean was big, big sacrifi
ce from Polish people. 
Q: Right. 

A: And Wa r s aw was destroyed 85 percent. 

Q: Right. Now I want to move back again, cause
 you still haven™t told me what did you do for 
the resistance in 19 four -- you joined in 1940 or 1939? 
A: E -- all time we was there, only I was limit 
to do some thing for Ar mi a Krajowa. M-Mostly 
our intention and possi -- possibility
 was holding the paper for printing. 
Q: What does that mean, hol
ding the -- you mean di -- 
A: That paper must be sto -- someplace -- 

Q: Stored?  

A: Storage. 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: And was storage in my father factory. 

Q: And you stored it there? 

A: Yes, I me an, that was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
55 
 
 
Q: Did you -- did your -- 
did your father know? 
A: Yes. My father was in underground from beginning, like me . 

Q: So was this a case where you -- where -- ho
w did he know, if you were in different groups? 
A: If you have pa-paper, so much like -- 

Q: So you can -- uh-huh. 

A: [indecipherable] you know, it was -- 

Q: There was no way not to know. 

A: Only no more question was. We  know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- if somebody -- 

Q: It was just there. 

A: -- who know be taking some  par t  for printing, 
I was there or my father was there, we give 
this. 
Q: Right. 
A: And that™s all, and our knowledge was end. On
e fellow only take the paper out for printing. 
Q: Right. Did you ever have second t
houghts about working for the underground? 
A: Oh no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no. And beside this, this -- if you are 25 
years old, and your all fr
iends are joining the 
organization, and you know this is good for c
ountry, good for history, a
nd all your friends doing 
the same , you cannot say I -- I not do this, becau
se you be scare and some  automa tically you 

were scare -- 

Q: Mm-hm, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
56 
 
 
A: -- and you can not show I am sca r e. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And everything was all right, if was not 
some body who was beaten by Gestapo -- by -- by 
German and forced to say where the paper, for 
example, or the ma  -- other stuff are. If only 
nobody talk, that™s you know, in the underground
 army was very important. Some body who 
drink too much was not allowed to join there, yo
u see, because something like this, you drink too 
much, you talk too much, and you know, is [i
ndecipherable] conspi -- spiratsin -- 
Q: A conspira -- 

A: [indecipherable] the orga
nization, you know, that™s -- 
Q: Now, for some body who™s never been in an
 underground -- does some body -- I know this is 
going to sound funny, does some body ma ke sure th
at you™re okay?  This friend asked you, did he 
have to tell people that he was 
going to ask you, and that they 
decided you were a safe person? 
A: Before -- 
Q: Do -- do you know -- do you know what I me an? 
A: -- before people -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- was taken to the organization -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- was search wi -- by all -- 

Q: Different people -- 

A: -- X number of people. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
57 
 
 
A: We  saw -- this fellow is all right, he is all 
right. He™s all right, you 
know, something like this, 
you know, that™s was the -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- conspiracy. 

Q: Right. So this happened before
 your friend approached you -- 
A: Oh yeah, sure. 

Q: -- because otherwise he woul
dn™t be allowed to approach you. 
A: No, no. 

Q: Right. 

A: People must trust you -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- must know your character, must know 
your mi nuses. If you have some mi nuses, you -- 

what really are danger, nobody take you.  
Q: Right. 
A: You know, that™s -- that™s 
[indecipherable] and some body who 
work for, for example, for 
Gestapo, for Germany, mean [indecipherable] 
you know, was -- can be killed, because you do 
some thing against the -- the Polish nation, me r 
-- our organization. And happened like this. 
Q: Depending upon how much you saw, I don™tknow how much you saw, but were wome n™s 

jobs different from men™s jobs 
in the underground?  Cause after the 
war you talked to your sisters 
and your mo ther -- 

A: No, now I -- a -- a woma n si -- was working ve
ry hard, and someti me is more brave like men. 
Only, they did different training, di
fferent job, different obligation. 

Q: And wha t  would be the difference? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
58 
 
 
A: Different for -- was for example like this, 
the men was training for military mostly a job, 
underground destroyed some thi
ng or sabotaged or some thing like -- wome n mostly -- not 
always, mos tly work for si -- help -- hosp
ital n -- care, or if some body™s wounded, you know, 
know what your supposed to do, transport the news 
from one comp -- unit to other unit, that™s 
was mostly the woman part.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now, very important, during the Warsaw upr
i -- during whole occupation was some group of 
wome n, very brave, and -- wome n, who sabotaged 
the railroad station --
 railroad tracks, you 
know, and blow the small bridges. That™s was wome n, 
trained for this stuff. And then that™s what 
happened. 

Q: And your sisters and your mo
ther also were probably -- 
A: N -- Mother no. 

Q: Not your mother. 
A: Mother only bless us, and si
ster, they both are train for -- not
 doctor, below the doctor, how 
you call it? 
Q: A nurse? 

A: Nurse. 

Q: Nurse. 

A: Nurse. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You know, prepare during the -- some  action, peopl
e be hurt or some thing, they -- that™s a 
woma n job [indecipherable] was. Take him to ho 
-- to pl ace where le -- physician can doing right 
the job. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
59 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: Keep the first idea to w
ounded people. And m-ma ny, ma ny wo
me n we re -- was very bright, 
and very -- 

Q: Brave, you mean? 

A: Brave, brave. 

Q: Brave. Mm-hm. 

A: That™s happen. 

Q: I -- I™m going to start going sort of back and 
-- back and forth with 
different -- different 
things, because your experience covers both the Polish Catholic or 
Polish Christian side as well 

as in some  ways what happened to Jews. When the ghetto was announced -- 

A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: -- for Jews in October 1940, and then the 
Jews move into the ghetto area, do you -- 
A: Must mo ve in -- 
Q: Must mo ve by November, right? 
A: -- that [indecipherable] right, and -- and -- 

Q: Do you reme mber -- 

A: -- Pole -- and Catholic 
must move on the other end. 
Q: Yes, and move on the other side. Do you re
member the Jews going through the streets and 
going?  

A: Oh yeah, sure, absolutely, absolutely, I reme
mber this how you know they was very upset, see 

the people you know, all -- all th
e house, and you know, [indeciphe
rable] house, and taking to 
other small places and so and so and vice 
versa. That™s was not good for Christian 
[indecipherable] ghetto, must move
 other ways, because all time  
be losing proposition, because if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
60 
 
 
you stay, you know, where everything is, you are 
satisfied, if you must
 move you lose all 
contact.  
Q: But did you see it as more dangerous for 
the Jews moving into the ghetto, given this -- 

A: Oh sure, absolutely, yes. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A: Yes, we know nots be -- nots --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- nots good. 

Q: Do you reme mber seeing the wall go up? 

A: Oh, na -- bleet up -- 

Q: Built. 

A: Was there, and I cr oss the --  the entrance to ghetto -- 

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- almost each day for two years. 
Q: But you reme mber seeing it being built? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Th-The wall. And did you wonder 
why, if they put the Jews i -- 
A: No, we know wh -- 

Q: You knew. 

A: -- why. We know this is for insulation 
the Jewish people from [indecipherable] 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And we know, and we know the next be Polis
h people. Maybe not th
is way, other way, and 
be very danger from German
 part of [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
61 
 
 
Q: In the underground, was there 
a discussion about what this 
would me an for the Jews -- 
A: Oh sure, and -- 
Q: -- an-and what, if anything, should be done? 

A: Anything, that™s -- that™s 
very, very difficult question. 

Q: Yes, I -- 

A: Talk about what can be done. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And wha t  -- if you suggest we do some thi
ng like this, and you don™
t know, you mu st think 
how many people lose th
e life doing this. Some time was not possible. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And doing some thing for Jewish people in th
is time was -- ma ny think not possibl e because 
was army -- army people working for this idea, Hitler idea, put the Jews there. For example, 

some  -- we -- and we have not power for this, ou
r organization I know -- not 
my unit, si -- in our 
organization help Jewish people who stop uprisin
g. And was too late. And beside this, some  
people here to gi -- why you no-not
 give the arms  to Jewish pe
ople in ghetto. Wa rsaw uprising 
was lose because was not enough guns, not e
nough ammunition, not enough nothing. In other 
words, give Akar, Armi a  Krajowa 
prepare a-and train Jewish people 
during the ar -- wa -- jury -- 
Jewish uprising and help was not possible. Wa s really not -- I help, I bring the sandwiches there 

each day or so -- or something, and that™s
 nothing. There was half million people. 
Q: Right. 

A: And you know, Polish underground me n go to -- 
through the all borders from Germany to 
Hispania and later there to A
nglia, and Mr. Karski, you know -- 
Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
62 
 
 
A: -- that  the name, go there and talk to [i ndecipherable] talk later ther e to -- to the President 
Roosevelt. And the people not believe first, 
and second, between us, Jewish people not help 
much. New York Jewish people not help much Je
wish people in Wa rsaw, because was not -- not 
believe can happen to people like this. 

Q: Did you know of Jan Karski™s work during th
e war, or did you only find out about it after? 
A: No during the war, I know after the war. 

Q: That he was a -- 

A: And I know hi m personally. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I know him personally. A very nice, you know, br
ave ma n and etcetera. And during this war, 
underground army cannot do mu -- much more. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because was each -- we must be careful w
ith the underground, also many German people live 
in Poland [speaks Polish here] was spy for Ger ma
ny. And you must be very close -- if we talk 
together we go outside, 
not inside because ma ybe is some thing not -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- connect some  instrume nt and that was not
 so easy. Now, every pa -- body criticize. For 

example, Jewish people suggest the railroad tr
acks in Poland to Auschw
itz supposed to be -- 
supposed to be bombard by alliance. Never happened. 

Q: You me a n by Americans? 

A: By -- right. By American or a -- or  a -- English. Never happened. You see, because this was 

calculated risk, is not ma ke sense, we must 
win the war. Meantime, you win the war, and how 
ma ny Jewis h or Polish live -- lost your life? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
63 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: You know that™s politics -- 
and -- and besides this, you must know one thing. After war -- 
after Germany take Poland and Russian take firs
t all guns, all radio, all 
instrument against the 
enemy, and in Poland was not -- you ca
nnot buy gun, you cannot have some  ammunition, 
because everything German took out. And later th
ere, before start the Wa rsaw uprising, how you 
can have the guns?  Buy from the German who are 
against the war happen, or kill the German 
and take the ha -- gun. Was not so easy. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Because if you kill one German, a hundred people was hanged tomorrow or -- or shot 

tomorrow. That™s very -- very touchy mo me nt. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: That™s not so easy, because some body special
, who never know in conspiracy, and never 
know the organization Ar mi a Krajowa think we 
supposed to do more, or why you not do this, 
how you not -- that™s was everything calcu
lated, you know. If you do some thing good for one 
person and lost two person home, that™s not make sense. And etcetera. And I am a little bit upset 

ma ybe, cause Karski was in the west, and not he
lp -- help, and not support ne -- from American 
governme nt and from Jewish governme nt -- for Je
wish, I am not [indecipherable], in Jewish. 
And that™s was for me  big question, why. I 
understand for example, the New York Jewish 
organization cannot give the guns, cannot give 
ammunition, and can™t give the money -- money, 

and for money, American money, you can buy in Po
land this time, everything. And that™s my 

point, the persona
l point view. 
Q: Right 

A: I not represent, you know, some  organization. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
64 
 
 
Q: Right, I understand.  
A: And that™s my personal view. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I know these people can help little 
bit more own people. That™s my feeling. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because we Polish people cannot -- Catholic 
pe ople, we cannot think some body can help us. 
Only English, French supposed to have some  
sign, agreement supposed to help Poland, but it 

never did, and forgot Poland. 

Q: We ™re going to take a break beca
use we have to change the tape. 
A: Oh, oh, oh. 
End of Tape Five

Q: Right. 
A: And I was the representative of th

Q: Really? 

A: And is -- Mr. Melami d introduced me  to grin
 -- Birenbaum, and I was fellow who collect the 
money -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and bring to the ghetto. 

Q: Right. Paul, I think you shouldn™t hold the 
-- dro -- I think you should drop the wi re. Okay, 
good. So, there is some thing called a transfer 
office. The Germans were giving transfer 
certificates so people could go in and out. Ma
ybe that™s where your 
father got it from. 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: But you don™t know. 

A: I™m not reme mbering, no. 
Q: So did you carry a piece of pape
r that authorized you to go on -- 
A: Oh sure -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- absolutely. Because how many times I gross -- cross the gate. 

Q: Yes. 

A: You know, the German call me , s how your paper.

A: And that -- if I saw this paper it was all right --  

Q: It was okay.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
68 
 
 
Q: Now, wh y was there -- was this connection ma
de before the war?  Your father knew Melami d 
before?  
A: Oh yes, before the war. Only the paper allowed you go to -- back and forth to the gate. Wa s 

later, after ghetto was -- 

Q: Wa s -- was closed? 

A: -- closed -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Yes. But did that paper allow you to do business? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: It did? 

A: No -- 

Q: That was okay? 
A: -- i-it was not talking about me
. Must go and buy what you -- I need. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: And that was known, that was okay? 

A: Yeah, that™s was -- important was the -- 
go there and cross the 
-- across the border. 
Q: What was -- you were now 21 years old. 1941 -- 

A: ™41 - ™42, some thing like that. 

Q: -- we talk about the beginning. What was it 
like for you to cross that border?  What did you 
see?  I mean, when you close your eyes, and you th
ink about what you saw when you walked into 
the ghetto, how different was it from
 what you saw outside the ghetto? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
69 
 
 
A: Oh no, th-that™s big different, you know, and 
how ma ny times you go there -- we were very 
upset. The people laying on the floor -- street
, dying. S-Some  people without the clothes -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- because if some body die on 
the street, the other 
people take the cl
othes and sell or 
some thing like this. It wa s very, very upset situ
ation. I told you before, 
the living si
tuation in 
ghetto was worse like in co 
-- in concentration camp. 
Q: So did you think that the Nazis -- the Germans 
were in some ways killing the Jews?  Without -
- without sent -- bef -- this is before they™r
e sending them to Treblinka, by starving them to 
death? 

A: Oh, sure, the German can shoot anybody on street, without a problem,and special in ghetto. 

And not ma ny German was in ghetto. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not ma ny Germans.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Only was on the gates and secure the whole to
wn wall to ghetto. And inside, I think, was pro-
probably -- I never saw, was some  Gestapo w
ho give the order to Judenrat, you do this, you do 
this, you produce this, you give me  some  goods or
 some thing like this. And mostly the German 
ask Judenrat and press -- give 
couple thousand people daily, daily, for work in east. That™s was 
idea. After couple months -- c
ouple weeks, the Polish undergr
ound organization check where the 
people are going on the east, and start know that
™s was Treblinka, a-and Sobibor -- Sobibor, and 
the other camp where the people was killed by ga
s, and later there cra -- cremated. And -- and 
the last time  I reme mber the Jewish rat was obl
igated -- mean Jewish 
rat and -- Jewish police 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480

supposed to deliver 10,000 people daily. And this
 go to Umschlagplatz. From Umschlagplatz 
was sent to concen -- to death cam
p, not concentration camp, death camp. 
Q: Right, right. And that was ma inly in 1942. 

A: Timi ng, you know, is little bit for me  -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- hard to -- 

Q: Did you see a lot of starving people when you walked in? 

A: In the ghetto? 

Q: Mm. 

A: Very mu ch so. 

Q: And -- and children? 

A: Each -- each time I was there, all time  wa
s not not one, hundred pe
ople dead or dying. And 
you know, the people who die on the street, Judenrat organ -- organize the -- some  transport. 
Two wheels and platform and two guys, or three 
guys take the s-street the dad -- dead body and 
put later there to the Umschlagpl
atz. Because to Umschlagplatz pe
ople know more like I know, I 
understand if was coo -- supposed to be deliver 
10,000 people for exampl e,
 the police take the 
dead people too, means hundred dead, plus 9,900 pe
ople. In other words, the transport com-
commander inside the ghetto take the dead 
body and deliver some place. I don™t know, I know 
it™s not there. And you cannot see 
hundred people -- thousand people 
right -- right ya -- one day 
on the street, because each day, or all time contin
ue, was clean the street
, by the dead body. Still, 
I saw not one, not two, hundred people dying or
 dead on the street. Wa s terrible situation, 
terrible. That™s was hunger, people ha ve nothi
ng to eat. Li ve very bad condition and nobody can 
help.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
71 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. So this must have been very depressing for you. 
A: Very depressing. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Very depressing. And the -- and the -- from 
this time, I was little bit not sure, and many 

Polish poor people, and young, deliver 
to ghetto food, b-back of a ka
 -- kartofel mean the potato 
or some thing others. And work was the Jewish
 people on the other side
, some  way, or you saw 
some  hole in the wall, ma ybe foot by 18 inch
es. The children go through. Children go through -- 
go to Aryan place, and be g or ma ke business,these small guys. Bring the money and buy some  -- 

some thing, I don™t know what kind food. Buy someth
ing and later right th
rough the hole, deliver 
there. And ma ny peopl e -- ma ny time  happene d the 
gendarmes was over there and ki -- killed the 
guy, young child. And we was popular in Poland
 -- Wa rsaw, in Aryan area where the young 
children doing some thing, buying or -- or beggin
g for food. Mean, even, ghetto was terrible, 
terrible situation. I not -- I be very gl
ad not see any more something like this.  
Q: No. 

A: Only later there, I saw in my concen
tration camp, 5,000 body [indecipherable] was burn, 
because crematorium was working 24 y -- f
our hours, and not -- cannot burn the body. 
Q: So they burned them in a -- 

A: And was terrible, terrible smell.

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: Because we know what -- 

Q: What™s happening. 

A: -- happened with the people. Special our ba

rising in the ghetto. 
Q: In the ghetto, uh-huh. I understand that you 
we re arrested twice, 
as you were going in? 
A: Yes, because I carry all the time something 
in my pocket if I go to 
-- and people who are -- I 
know on the other side, begging me , give me  some
thing, bring us some t hing, I bring s-some thing 
what I can put in my pocket. And one day was, you know, sticking too much, and -- 

Q: It was stinking? 

A: Sticking. 

Q: Sticky?  Oh, it 
was sticking out. 

A: Sticking out. 

Q: So people could see it, I see. 

A: And -- right, and German -- germ -- gendarme s

that™s the only -- in German all time must be count.

A: We ll, Wa rsaw uprising, you know, this was, for me  was only 30 days. 

Q: Right. 

A: And first two weeks I was very excited, and on 
other hand was very upset, you see, because in 

our unit was not enough guns, not enough arms . And th
at™s was the big part
. 30 percent in our 
group was with the guns. The other part has no guns. 

Q: Nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480

A: Nothing. You know, that™s was the whole prob
lem, and after two weeks I was very upset, 
between me  and you. We  di -- Wa rsaw uprising wa

mostly young people was anxious to fight with 
German. And before the Warsaw uprising we 
heard in radio the Soviet army put
 the Soviet, I don™t know army or

never help -- after star
t Wa rsaw uprising, next 
time was the last informa tion for mos t  folk
 [indecipherable]. Nobody help, nobody talk through 
the radi o about this, and that™s was the reason Po
lish -- Wa rsaw uprising was collapse. Not help. 
And Stalin st op all army and not let hi m go help Warsaw because was very upset to Poland from 

beginning and let the German kill the Polish patriots. That ™s what they did. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: And during the Wa rsaw uprising, my function wa
s not the heroic big one. And still, a-after 30 
days, I supposed to go to -- through the canals -- 
Q: Sewers. 
A: Sewer, right, to mi ddle part of the Wa rsaw 
where was the whole army 
concentrate there. And 
because this time I was without the guns and a rifl
e or some thing like this, I was sent back and 
first go the people who has ammunition, grenades 
and supply like guns and rifles. And two, three 
hours before I go there to sewer, German put
 the gasoline grenades, blow out the sewer 
some place there, a-and we was not able go there.
 We  must go back. After we go back, I mi  -- go 
to my house , because my -- my officer rank -- hi
gh off -- ranking officer ta
ke us together and 
said, from now on we have not chance to surviv
e if we are group. We  must go each other ea -- 
own way, and car -- everybody is on own way. And w
ho has the ammunition, or -- or a pistol or

some thing, must throw out, destroy, throw out, don™
t give the German. And 
take the clothes what 
you have, change, and go to the -- to
 own idea -- own -- you are on your own. 
Q: On your own, uh-huh. 
A: And after this -- that™s was six o™clock, or fi
ve o™clock morning, I listen
ed this and we was s -- 
everybody go in own way, and I go to my parent™s
 house where I live, and I chane -- I was lucky 
change the clothes, wash myself and eat some th
ing, and after 15 mi nute, 
ma- maybe half hour, I s 
-- heard, alles raus, bandit hande
hore, and some thing that™s German ask going out, and the hands 
up, and leave the basement because my -- my fa mily house was destroye d, and fami ly was in 

baseme nt. That™s what™s [indeciphera
ble]. And fr om there out we go out. 
Q: Now, you™re all t
ogether, your father -- 

A: Yes, I -- right. 

Q: -- your mother, your sist --

A: -- another part in mi ddle of the Warsaw. 

Q: Yes. 

A: In a -- in a [indecipherable]. And we go out sl
owly, and German put later their grenade there, 
and destroyed everything what was there. And we 
go walk from our street 
to the Vola. That™s p -
- outskirt of Warsaw. And -- and meantime the Ge
rman pick up people from the line, and one of 
the worst part was Ukrainian, and that™s real  Uk
rainian only was with German ar my, and created 
the line, and between these two line we can go to
 Vola. Meantime the Ukrainian was --  created 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
96 
 
 
very bad situation. My -- for example, my mo
ther has a -- a wedding band, and this fellow ask, 
give me  the band, give me  the gold band. My 
wife -- my mother cannot take out the band, 
because you know, is old woma n, a nd cannot o -- 
you know what, the fellow take the knife, and 
try cut the finger for this stupid, st
upid pieces of the gol
d. And my mother start yelling, and some  
of his German officer heard this, stop and take
 this guy out from the line, and said go ahead. 
Because German are not good people, only 
I never saw the people robbed some body. 
Q: You never saw?  

A: Robbed. 

Q: Robbed, uh-huh 

A: Stolen. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know, that™s were very discipline. Like 
American also, disciplin

part people this time, on the world. Was kill own 
people for couple some thing like this. And after 
we go -- 

Q: Can I ask you some thing? 

A: Yeah.

And this time German think and talk these ar e 
not freedom fighter, these are bandit. And again,

Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: You wanted to say some  things a
bout Flossenbürg that you hadn™t me ntioned. 
A: Y-Yes. After 50 years, our liberation by Ge
neral Patton army, the army, I was invite by 
German authority to celebrate 50 years of free
dom. And was nice celebrat
ion, and I learn in my 
concentration camp, that™s was small camp, wa
s that 77,000 people, between the peop -- the 18 
nation people, because wa s 18 nation people there, was -- mos t  important was 28,000 Russian 

officers, army officers, 17,000 Polish prisoners, 3,200 French, 3,200-some thing Czech, 3,100 

Jewish people, and ma ny others. Between this 
wa s two American. Two American pilots, people 
who were supply during the Wa rsaw uprising, our 
ammunition and some  e quipment. And this p-

pray -- pray -- plane -- plane was shot over 
the Wa rsaw and very close to our house on 
[indecipherable] street and two pilots was together with Polish uprising people. End of the s -- 

September, we supposed to go out from the place where we was and sent to concentration camp, 

and these two pilot was together 
with us. And two American pilots
 was dead in concentration -- 
our concentration camp. Besides this, was also k
illed in -- really hang, two very famous German 

officer. One was General Canares, very fa mous 
person in Germany, and because was against the 
Hitler, was two days before our liberation, two, 
three days before our liberation, was st ripped 

from the clothes and hang naked in concentr
ation camp. That™s was General Canares. Also 
second very fa mous ma n was the leader of the sh
 -- leader, church lead
er fr om the Aus berg, I 
think so. This is Protestant, Protestant leader, 
and was also against the 
Hitler and was hang naked 
on the -- in the -- in this camp. That™s was ma ny 
others, and after the Ame r ican, I not me ntion 
this, ne -- we  was very please see the Ameri
can, and American was so special, American young 
people, boys, was crying see the situ
ation like we live in, our [ind
ecipherable], our hospital. And 
ask our people if -- I mean, the people who was 
go int -- in camp, if you have some thing and you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
106 
 
 
supposed to do right or  kill fellow who did so
me thing wrong for you, you can have the rifle, you 
can kill. Because ever ythi ng -- no one Polish guy, not take the rifl e, not kill German who was in 
the concentration camp. And still ration offi cer -- 
offi cers took the stone and stoned to death one 
German -- oldest fellow in the concentration camp.That™s was for us little bit not human either. I 

-- 

Q: Why do you -- why do you think no -- no one who was 
Polish -- Polish Catholic killed one of 
the Germans? 

A: Not Polish Catholic, that™s was -- 

Q: Not, I know, I know, why didn™t -- why -- why didn™t, do you think? 

A: Listen, I -- that™s, you n -- our fa
ith. You not -- you are not the judge. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Judge is some body else, you know, and you cannot 
take eye of eye, you know, that™s -- that™s 
our natura l, and we not did this. And I am glad
 I not saw one person who revenge this, kill or  
beat or some thing. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And that™s the point and still the living in th
e concentration camp was terribl e, and still I have 
luck go through, and I feel we did some thing 
good for people, like for example the 12 Jewish 
people, the -- some  got -- leave us chance to
 live through the concentr
ation camp. Tha t ™s my 
story.  

Q: What do you carry with you?  Do you think about 
this a great deal, this
 part of your history 
and talk about it a lot? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
107 
 
 
A: I not talk -- I have not s -- chance to talk becau
se some people not like listen this. First is life 
for these people are too complicated and has 
enough own problem, not like listen my problem, 
and my past. And that™s re -- talk 
only to these peopl
e who like listen. 
Q: Like me. 
A: Like you. 

Q: And you talked with your children about this? 

A: Oh yes, I educated my children very much, 
and grandchildren, and I talk to ma ny people who 

are invite me  to school or some thing, what 
happened, and how people react in own life. And 

children are good educated, know 
what happened if some body lose
 mi nd and heart. That like 
Hitler and second, maybe  the first bandit was the Stalin. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Stalin ki ll own people, 20 million Russian and 
Soviet people. Hitler ki ll maybe more, only not 
kill own people. Russian kill own people, too. That
™s two very bad character people, and I be 
glad if during my short right now time, I 
not see some body who do for our [indecipherable] 
people some thing like this. And that™s -- that™s 
my point of view. I like people born free and 
supposed to be free.  

Q: And so the various genocides that have happened since World Wa r 
11
, must be very upsetting 
to you, in Ca mbodia, and Rwanda, and East Timor, and Bosnia. 

A: That -- that™s how ma ny times I know something -- some dictator do something like this, I am 

very upset. And right now the situ
ation in Iraq is also no good and 
what we can do, and I be glad 
if the war be fi nish and people there will be fr ee. 

Q: Do you -- would you say you learned some th
ing from this experience in World War 
11
? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
108 
 
 
A: Oh sure [indecipherable] experience -- I am 
sure I learn one thing, I cannot hurt some body if -
- if is not really necessary, becau
se that™s not -- this is my natu
ral, and I not like people like di dn 
-- on one side terrorism, other side people w
ho kill own people like Cambodia and in other 
places, you know, those fo -- what is the reason? 
Q: But you did more than not harm people, 
you also risked your life to save people. 
A: Well that™s -- I am glad I ha
ve the chance to do this, because 
probably other people are in the 
same  pos -- like do the same , only has not chance. 
God give me  the chance do this, and I pick up. 
I think that™s the right way. Because so me  people 
like do this and have not chance. I wa s chance, 
I take my chance and I did it. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I am glad the people who were saved by me
 are glad and ask for me , ask for my me dal, 
and that™s build you a good feeling. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And I do some thing for the people appreciate it. That™s -- 
Q: So you must be very proud to have that me dal from Yad Vashem. 

A: Oh sure I am, because you know, you feel this way, people know you did some thing good and 

try give your chance show the other people,
 life can be this way, not opposite way. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Save and not kill. That™s -- wh
at happened right now in -- for ex
ample, in Iraq, or Israel, or 
other pl aces, I not like. I not like. I like peopl
e live together and you know, sometime  don™t take 
too much appetite. Take 
everything for myself. Sh
are with the other guy. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0480  
109 
 
 
A: And mostly the worries because  fellow has to
o much appetite, too much for myself. What 
about the other guy?  Must le -- 
has the same stomach, supposed to
 eat, live, like you e-eat and 
live. Maybe you are smarter and th
e other guy is less smarter, well 
that™s -- that™s other thing. 
And still give  the chance people be pe ople, human being.  

Q: Is there anything more you™d like to
 say that we  haven™t talked about? 
A: No, I -- what I can say?  I di
d everything what I can, and I am 
proud of this and like our Pope 
said, help people who need the he
lp, and special help, like I help
 this time , for brother in our 
faith, all brother our faith, like was Jewish faith.
