YEHUDA ADAM 
April 4, 1997
 
 
Question: This is an interview for the U.
S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.  We are 
interviewing Yehuda Adam.  My 
name is Esther Finder.  Today is April 4th, 1997.  This 
is Tape 1, Side A. Pleas
e tell me your name.   
Answer: My  name is Yehuda George Ad am, A d a m.  
Q: And was this your name at birth?  
A: No.  I was born as George Stern S t    S t r n.  Stern.   

Q: When  were you born?  
A: In    when or where?   
Q: I actually need both.   

A: I was born in Budapest 
in July the 3rd, 1929.  
Q: Is that where you grew up?  
A: Yes.   
Q: Can you tell me what was it like growing up in     in Budapest.   

A: Well, basically, as the Budapest Jews, we 
were pretty bad luck , and tragedy or through 
stories start in March 19, 1944.   

Q: I'd like to know a little bit about Budapest 
when you were a child 
growing up.  Let me 
start by asking you about your family.  Can you
 tell me what did your parents do for a 
living. 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

A: I was born in a very middle class Jewish
 family.  My father had a moderate sized 
department store in Budapest.  He had trul
y no any financial problems. I went to the 
Jewish elementary school, and basically in 1
939 I was a nice supposed to go to  starting 
my  gymnasium, which is high school, in Hung
ary and when the classes started.  And 
numerous classes means that we have a rela
tively small percentage of Jewish students 
that are admitted to the high schools.  I believe it was 4 percent of the total of student 
population.  I'm really not sure about the pe
rcentage. But, yes, in May, I was between 
those fortunate ones that were admitted to high sc
hool and four of us    four Jew in class 
of about 50 started our high sc
hool years. The school which I went to , it happened to be a 
rather revisionist national and rather anti Se
mitic school.  And as far as discrimination, 
certainly it was, but neverthele
ss, it was tolerated.  They di
dn't  have any, shall I say, 
outstanding incidence during 
the years up to 1944.   
Q: Can you tell me your 
parents' names.   
A: My father's name is Anton, 
and my mother is Barbara.   
Q: Did you have any br
others or sisters?  

A: No.  I am only child.   
Q: You said that there were incidents that were tolerable, anti Semitic incidents that were 
tolerable.  Can you be mo re sp
ecific.  What kinds of th ings
 did you yourself experience 
or did you yourself see?  
A: We were almo st constantly in th e centra
l of    of, I should say, remarks and anti 
Semitic passions.  But those 
were kind of rather intellig
ently, if that is the right 
expression, and no physical vi
olence, maybe once or twice th
rough the years that I've 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

been in th e high school.  And th is did not 
come from th e faculty.  
It's mostly of peer 
pressure and anti Semitic peer pressure. But thos
e incidents become a part of our life.  So, 
as a matter of fact, we barely 
noticed them after a while.   
Q: Did you come from a religious family? 
A: No.  No .  We have always been on th e  
  on the reform, quote,
 unquote, side.  They 
called us the Yom Kippur Jews, that my  parents 
and myself went to    at the Beit Knesset, 
maybe twice a year.  Nevertheless, I had a ve
ry  fabulous and big style bar mitzvah.   

Q: Can you tell me about it.   

A: Well, it was in the    in the great Beit Kn
esset of this and a very large crowd, I would 
say.  And of course, I knew the Sidra, a
nd th ere were no    any hitches.  And 
subsequently, it was a rather large reception. 
 And as a matter of fact, it was in 1942.  
And I had no id ea that was practically the sa
me time that the Ru
ssia ghetto, but sometime 
after.  It was in Pesach 1942.  And as a 
matter of fact, that it was after the Nazi 
conference, and the ____ was alrea
dy a forced  thing.  They didn't know    at least we did 
not realize it. So our life was relatively not 
even    not even not relatively, but fine, 
financially, as well as any other area, even so
cially.  Obviously, our social attachment 
was almost exclusively Jewish.   
Q: So th e only traditional observances that 
you have mentioned that
 you observed were 
the bar mitzvah and being a Yo m Kippur 
Jew. Did you have 
a kosher home?   
A: No, we did not.   

Q: Did you observe any of
 the other holidays?  

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

A: Well, especially during the my years in
 Jewish elementary school, we did.  
Nevertheless, our store was open, except in
 Rosh  Hashana and Yo
m Kippur.  And we 
were rather assimilated Hungarian Jews. But I 
have to emphasize, despite the fact that we 
were assimilated, we were Jews.  It was unq
uestioned and had never 
been a question.   
Q: You said your family was no
t very religious but they se
nt you to a Jewish school, 
religious school. Did they ev er ex
plain to you why th ey did that?  
A: Well, it's probably fact of convenience.  
It was close, and there 
is children that they 
went to kindergarten togeth er with at the sa
me school.  And I'm sure 
that my  parents were 
aware of the importance to have some kind of Je
wish tradition put in my 
head at the time.   
Q: Do you have any idea of
 how large the Jewish population was in your town?  
A: Of course.  That is not difficult.  Budape
st, at that time, I believe, the population was 
about a million; and the Jewish population estim
ated at th e time, if I'm not mistaken, 120 
or 130,000.  That's the capital of Hungary and ob
viously in the largest c
ity in the country.   
Q: When  you were growing up, 
what language or languages did you sp eak in your home?  
A: Well, we spoke at home exclusively Hu ngarian.  My parents speak German, and very 
little of it.  And then during 
high school, I learne
d English, but my parents did not.   
Q: When  you were growing up, what did you 
do for fun when you we
re not in  school?  
A: Well, as a -- what every y
oung child does, we had a gang of
 mostly Jewish friends and 
played around and    
played around, obviously,
 and went to movies and sport activities.  
We belonged to the a Jewish athletic club. 
 So we did gymnastics.   We went swimming 

and some ski, as well as some ic e  skating 
in the winter time.  That is nothing the 
exception.  That was the exactly
 the same  thing that a mi ddle-class Jewish kid does in 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

Europe. Oh, I had    just to emphasize, no one 
in the family spoke Yiddish .  I think it's an 
important point.  As a matter of fact, my  gr
andparents did not speak Yiddish.  They  spoke 
German fluently, but none of them spoke Yiddish .   
Q: Did your fami ly have a long history in Budapest?  

A: Well, my recollection, my maternal grandf
ather was born in a small town close to the 
Czech Hungarian border, and my other    
my other grandfather was born in Moravia. 
And subsequently, th e family then moved to
 began to a town  wh ich was close to the 
Czech Hungarian border.  It's 
called Kom√°rom, which is not far from    from B ratislava.   

Q: You were telling me  that you were havi
ng your bar mitzvah 
and you were doing all 
these things like going to movies and sports. 
 And you had no idea what was going on 
with Jewish communities in other parts of Europe?  

A: Well, we were an assimilated Jewish family. 
 I put it very    very bluntly.  We    I 
suppose we did.  Obviously  the Jewish laws 
which    the anti Jewish laws which started 
up in Hungary and we were (?ab
solutely?) and Italy, and up 
to that with regard to the 
state of the war and    however, the    obvi
ously, the extent that horrendous happenings 

which were not far from us, we did not really 
realize, except that in
 the 1940s and 1941, 
1942, obviously, first of all, our mere pop
ulation had gone for 
paramilitary duties, 
including, obviously, my  father and all the fa
mily.  And they were taken most of the time 
to the Russian front.  And the atrocities re
garding the Jewish paramilitary personnel 
_____+ ev ery day.  And the parents, the 
friends, the friends of friends, everybody 
between the ages of 18 to at least at that
 time, I believe, 48, we have a    in the 

paramilitary units. And the Hungarian anti Sem
itism was flourishing. 
 So it was clear to 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
8 
us what's g o ing on at least within the Hung
arian border.  But as far as what's g o ing on, 
the first realization through 
the what's happening was when
 the non Hungarian citizen 
Jews were deported to come in 
_____ wh ich was    I believe it was in '41, in    I think it 
was in the winter of 1941.  And a few 
who surviv ed and came back at all had 
unbelievable stories which was very difficult to 
realize for us that they are true and they 
are really reliable information because our life wa
s totally different and we didn't feel this 
tremendous pressure.  We did feel pressure, but   
 but as individuals, they let    they let us 
at that time to be. It is true that the Hungari
an     the Jewish Hungarian professionals are 
slowly lose their jobs in 1941.  There is a 
second Jewish law came out, said the practicing 
professionals lost their licenses, an d there was 
a lot of restrictions. But as far as personal 
dangers, so to speak, it was far fro m us.  In a 
sense, it was    for these delusions, and they  
said to us that's what's ha
ppening across the border.  It can
not happen in Hungary.  After 
all, we are Hungarian Jews and Hungarians a
nd th at    that maybe can happen on th e east 
but not in a cultured country  like Hungary an
d the usual hog wash  that everyone is 
basically at least in    Hung
arian assimilated  Jews felt.   
Q: Do you recall any talk among 
th e adults that    you were rather young    among the 
adults about what was writing and sa
ying an d doing vis √† vis the Jews?  
A: But of course.  That's  that's obvious.  Ag
ain, you see, you have to at that time despite 
obviously it was clear to us and it was priority 
of the German not    I wouldn't say general 
journalistic activity because it
's a matter of fact that in
 the 1940 and 1941 it was still 
sporadic and not totally centrally
 organized. But we looked at it 
in a    in a    through a 
pink eyeglasses, that we are out ofit, that we cannot    it is not the 
same.  It is    it is not    

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

and after, I mean, June 1941 when the Russian, 
the Barbarossa started 
up, they said, well, 
it could happen maybe in Russia,
 but it's  never happen in  H
ungary. So we were aware of 
the fact and knew very well, and the  the gene
ral policy lines were very clear of the Nazi 
party and Hitler and    but    but we felt th
at maybe in a bit we are somehow immune from 
this.  And of course it's was kind of a    of
 a trying to, so to spea
k, stay away from the 
reality. But it was very difficult later on, obv
iously, when you find that you    your 
relatives, y our father, your friends, in the    
in the paramilitary and it's    and died from 
typhus or from    from tremendous atroc
ities from the Hungarian _____ and Army 
personnel.  Obviously we were aware of the 
fact. But still the    the everyday bourgeois 
life, so to speak, it's o n  th
e    we somehow -- I think that was very difficult to the 
Hungarian Jews that tried to kind of    of se
parate themselves from th
e reality.  It's really 
delusional.  That    that was the protection.
  That was the unseen defense mechanisms, so 
to speak.   
Q: Did you personally have any 
contact with anybody who had le
ft    had fled from Nazi 
occupied territory or from Germany itself?  
A: Not until 1943.  1943 I had a 
friend that    they were fo
reign, not Hungarian citizens, 
and they  were _____ and th ey succeeded to co
me back to parents of massacre and other 
family and they came back and back
    but the first time that  
  that personally I heard that 
such things could happen.  But it was an isol
ated incident.  Really. Subsequently, after 
that    as far as we discussed this problem, she 
said that it's probably there is a traumatic    
posttraumatic shock syndrome, the boy doesn'tknow wh at the hell he's
 talking about.  
Again, they tried    I mean, it's kind of a 
natu ral denial type of mannerism, I suppose.  

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

That was it.  But it was the first time that
 I had personally had so me contact with 
someone who went thro ugh hell and back.   
Q: Tell me a little about what y
our days were like in the earl
y '40s.  What was the typical 
day fo r you in '41 and '42?  Ho
w did things start to change?  
A: Not much, really.  Not 
much.  '40, '41, '4 2 , as I said  
  I had my bar mitzvah in 1942.  
A big tzimmes, everybody happy, a full pres
ence.  And my problems were th at in 

mathematics I got a B instead of an  A and that 
we didn't reach    our group in  the sport 
arena didn't  do well and there are, you know, 
no mo re American films.  Obviously, that 
was a fact    a fact of life.  The German, 
Italian films were shed, 
and I mean that was a 
fact, even na√Øve, and we lived all of 
us normal student and teenager life.   
Q: When did you start    you yourself star
t noticing that things were changing?   
A: As I said, in 1943 and in  the end of 1942 a
nd '43, then they    the close friends and the 
family started getting involved , and I don't know.  
I don't want to sound naive.  But that    
that's the way that I recollect my
    my memory. In 
any event, in 19   
  1942 and 1943, the 
tension began getting high.  An
d the    and the awareness that was living has become 
more and more obvious for us. 
 Not talking about, obviously
, reading the papers and the 
German victories and the unstoppable Reich. 
 It was before Stalingrad, obviously, and 
before North Africa and Roma, and so forth. So
 the whole thing started a lot    to be 
hopeless as far as    as a Jewi
sh individual that's in the axis
 of the _____ Nazi Hungary.  
But desp ite that, still with that, life went on
, and no major economic hardship s yet.  My 
father was in the    in the   
 that's     that's ca
lled the work un
its, but the shop went on, and 
my life    my mother    sorry
    my mother took care of the things, and we still had hope 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 1 
that we had a home. So the major    desp
ite the awareness include
s the awareness that 
everyday life and everyday pr
oblems are, no question, th
e major considerations.   
Q: So when you look back, wh
en  was the mo ment that you bega
n to realize that you were 
in very serious danger?  
A: It was a Saturday , and th e and my self a
nd my  very close friends at school met and 
walked around the major railw
ay station in Budapest.  That was the north ern railway 
station.  And we saw the first German so ldier.  That was a somewhat rainy day. I 

recollect that the guys there 
at the wore a long, black rain
 coat, and they had a kind of 
plaque that    on their neck, and it turned to
 be the military    German military police.  
And that was the day that the Germans had 
invaded Hungary . An d when  we stood by and 
we looked at this soldiers of
 police    military  police persons that are asking papers for 
everybody is coming out from th
e railway station and putting pe
ople aside in groups, that 
was really the first mo ment that it's     it
's  hit home, that we are in real trouble.   
Q: What were some of the th
ings that happened next?  
A: Well, we got home.  And my father was away
, of course, in the    in the we called it 
"munkaszolg√°lat" in Hungarian, which is ba
sically forced-labor unit. And my mother 
said, "So wh at do you say?  Di
d you see them?Ô¨Ç And he said, "Of course I did see them." 
"So?" "So same thing will happen
 here that we hear about it 
in other countries where the 
Nazis are.Ô¨Ç Okay.  The things
 started to escalate very rapidly because the Germans came 
in in the 19 of March.  And in th e beginning 
of April    I believe it was mid April, the 
20th of April    we already woke up with a 
yellow star in our ches
t.  Okay?  That was 

basically the first decision of 
the new Hungarian government, 
that all the Jews have to 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 2 
wear a yellow star. Still, the schools were open
.  So we went to the school with the 
yellow star on us. But you know
 what?  I truly recall that
, despite of the heavy anti 
Semitic at mosphere in the school
, nobody said a word, not    no
t    just as though nothing 
happened .  I don't know why.  Maybe it was some 
kind of a    a    h o w should I say?  The 
consciousness?  I really don 't know what was 
the reason, but we didn't feel that this 
yellow star is    makes any difference in the 
relationship.  The rela
tionship wasn't good.  
I'm not saying.  Bu t certainly it did not influen
ce. So that was the th
at was the truly for a 
teenager the first true and the fact that th
e _____    that the future is _____+.   
About    I think about three or four weeks 
later, there were massive air bombardment in 
Budapest, and many buildings were destroyed.
  And th at was the second thing th at I 
recall that the government    they required th
e Jewish apartments to
 be evacuated for the 
casualties, as a matter of fact, those Chris
tians whose homes was destroyed. So about 
2,000 families were kicked out
 very swiftly from their home. 
 That was the first one. And 
subsequently     I believe it was in May    that
 the law came that Jews has to be    has to 
move to certain houses.  There is a clear di
stin ction with the mark
ed houses.  And then, 
obviously, our life totally crum
bled because we had a couple
 of hours to evacuate our 
home, wh ich was just    I mean, you know, it
's very traumatic, obviously , not only fo r a 
teenager, but the whole family. So
 we practically left almost ev
erything in    and a couple 
of other families which house become a Jewish
 house were still outside.  That happened 
in May. In the meantime, obviously, all th
e Jewish government employees were kicked 
out.  All the professionals, they lost their lic
enses.  And nevertheless, still, I believe until 
June, the stores    the Jews' 
stores were not nationalized.  Th
at was the time.  I'm  not sure 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 3 
about the date. And then started, shall I say, th
e news come in that there are ghettos in the 
country, especially in the northe
ast part at the beginning as it  
  every day in the    the new 
Jewish laws were printed, placards, and of co
urse in newspapers and so forth.  And the 
deportations started.  And we were aw
are of the deportations, obviously.   
Q: When  you said new Jewish laws were bei
ng    you know, were coming out, can you be 
specific.  Can you give me a few examples of
 some of these laws that started to come 
out?  

A: Sure.  That's no different.  Professional 
restrictions, subsequently food restrictions, 
subsequently  housing restrictions.  Then  some 
forced labor, especially for women and    
and male. So those are    they were basically
 escalating the restrictions which had become 
more and more and more severe, and you 'r e   
 and your life as an individual was totally 

and entirely interrupted from ever
y point of view, and on the 
top of it obviously that you 
didn't  feel yet but you    
you personally, but you st
arted to notice the problema tic the    
the territories in Hungaria, the country side
, there are ghettos formed.  And the ghettos 
started to be deported, although they had no
 idea, as far as I know, not only my self but 
my family, about Auschwitz, or
 about the (?fenishtislagers?
).  We did not know.  But 
certainly we did know that thes
e people were taken away as if
 a packaged  or together and 
all the belongings.  They were rough, and th ey
 were violent, and they  were in horrible 
condition.  These people were taken away to th
e east.  T h at's what we know.  But we did 
know. And so a    the tension 
grew  constantly, although, again,
 we still hoped, at least, or 
we did not realize or we did not want to realize 
that the standard  of ou
r life is in danger as 
well.

Q: What happened 
to  you next?  
A: Well, we moved in    in a Jewish house. 
 And th en subsequently , I was taken    it was 
in -- I believe it was in June.  I was taken with
    we'v e been    we'v e been in Jewish 
juvenile units.  And that was kind of    al
so kind of a paramilitar
y business.  It's not 
paramilitary.  Sorry.  It was not
hing to do with military.  Forced
-labor plant for business.   
So it    we were all brought up to collectively 
go to a    a brick factory to work.  I think it 
was in June.  But I really don't remember 
ex actly.  I think it was 
end of May, beginning 
of June. And we were taken in _____ ju st a  
  it's basically  the ___
__ the Danube, and it's 
an old part of outskirts of the city area and 
in a big factory.  And we work ed th ere, my  
schoolmates.  We were basically togeth er, and we
    we    it was a 2 4  hour business.  We 
didn't  get home at all.  So we 
stayed there around the clock. It
's just like a    truly, like a 
working, like, so to speak.  The whole th
ing was like closed, an
d there was German 
armory around and, in fact, in
 the brick factory.  The food
 wasn't too bad and the    
physically, we were not    not insulted.  We 
were not.  We just had to work, basically.  It 
was a no special hardship.  Of course, we st
ill had the yellow star.  And as a matter of 
fact, that yellow star at that time w e had to 
wear a patch, a yellow pass    a yellow     
Q: Armband?  

A:    armb and    thank you    a yellow 
armb and. And we work ed an d work ing about ten 
hours, with one hour dinner   
 a lunch break, and then  in a la
rge barrack we slept.  And in 
the mo rning at 6:00 o'clock, we started up again.
  So that was    th
at was the thing. But I 
very, very rarely remember is that
 at the brick factory had its own 
rail station.  It's not rail    
the rail, because the bricks were transported by ra
il.  And    and they    there were large, 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 5 
huge wagons brought in to th
e brick factory railway.  And we looked at them and we 
found there are and the    and the    some have
 German _____+ in this car.  And this car    
this railway branch was unde
r the command of the German 
Hungarian German armory.  
And they were    they were occasionally 
they rather friendly. And we asked them, 
"What's going on here?" And they 
said, "Oh, yours    your tu
rn will come very soon too." 
So I think th at we didn't need too mu ch imag
ination to  know that probably those were the 
deportation wagons.  That's what
 I reme mb er very vividly.   
Q: We're going to pause,
 and I'll change tape. 
Q: This is Tape 1, Side B.  We're interv
iewing Yehuda Adam. And you were telling me 
about wo rking in th e brick factory.  I wanted 
to ask you what exactly
 was your job in th e 
brick factory.   

A: Oh, I cleaned the    the place.  That's basi
cally what I did all day long.  And it was a    
a    I'm looking for the word . What
 do you use to clean the floor?   
Q: A broom?  A mop?  

A: A broom.  That's  right.  A broom.  As a ma
tter of fact, it's a coarse broom that I had to 
keep the whole place clean.  We went two of us
.  We did cleaning jobs.  That's  what was 
my  job.   

Q: You mentioned that you were in a barrack
.  I would like to ask you what were the 
living conditions in the barrack and also in 
the yellow star houses. 
 You didn 't tell me 
what the conditions for living were.   
A: Well, first, the    in the brick factory, ther
e was a huge    the brick has to be dried, and 
there is larg e huts, and on these huts when   
 there were perches, they the wood pads    

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 6 
primitive wood pads, and that's ba
sically it.  We had to covers, 
and that's  it.  T h at was the 
situation of that. As far as the    th e recorded
 that    the houses w
ith the yellow star, it's 
depends.  There have been 
families together, and in th
e most of them, the living 
conditions were not    not atrocious.  It 
was crowded, obviously, 
and cramped. But it was 
really    what I mean is you left behi
nd your belongings, your life achievements, 
everything else.  It was obvi
ously very difficult, mostly 
emotionally, but physically it 
wasn't too bad.  A family had 
one room instead of four or fi
ve, six, or seven.  And th ey 
shared facilities, obviously.  But 
in most instances    and I'
m talking about people that I 
know and they were middle class people   
 they had enough. Th
e food was still    
although scarce, but certainly didn't    it wasn
't hunger.  There were restricted hours that 
you can get out and buy 
food on your fo od cards, obviously, 
which provided  you    I don't 
remember as far as the calories or    I think 
   no.  I don't want to think because I don't 
know, really, if it was 1,200 or 1,500.  I have 
no idea.  I really don't remember the details.  
But nevertheless, we had enough. It happened 
to be that we moved into a friend's house 
that had a large grocery chain.  So, I mean, 
there was no    no problem as far as we are 
concerned.  And a crowded conditi
ons but    but livable at that
 time for us.  So I can 't talk 
about really how the popula
tion, Jewish population at large.  Pr
obably they were    but I    
I believe the same thing happened with my vast 
family.  Until they were
 in the    in the 
yellow star houses, they were pretty well off. 
 They were    and in a Jewish community 
and you know how it is.  I thi
nk one helps the other, especially in hard times.  It was not 
too bad.   
Q: So you were work ing 
in  the brick factory?  

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 7 
A: Right.  Right.  And if I re
member correctly, in Ju
ly, certain part of July    I think it was 
on th e 15th or 20th or 25th    there was an
 unsuccessful putsch ag ainst party, against the 
regime at the    at the Nazi party    the 
Hungarian Nazi party, which is the Arrow Cross 
party started to do a putsch.  And th ere have been
 a very strict military
 rules in the    in 
the capital, in Budapest. And the streets were
 full with soldiers, a
nd they dug in with 
heavy artillery and so  forth and so on.  And 
we were ourself and    a friend of mine 
decided that's enough for us, we are going and ta
king off.  And that's what
 we did.  We    
we got through the    the partitions and went hom
e.  And we said that's    we had to know 
what's happened with our mothers and    an
d so we escaped and    to putting it very 
mildly, very simply. So we got 
home and, well    okay.    
Q: I'm going to ask you, wh en
 you walked  out, nobody trie
d to stop you?  Even on your 
way home, how did you make your way home?  
I'd like you to  explain 
how you did this.   
A: There was a great confusion because of 
the political situation.
  So everybody was 
busy, especially the    the current local German
 army and so forth.  
So in the late evening 
hours, we took ourselves, and 
we climbed through the    the partition and walked home.  
It was about a four hour walk or five and a 
half hour walk from the brick factory to the 
middle of the city.  We left.  And    a
nd we got home, period. And my  mo ther was, 
obviously, extremely happy.  
And subsequently, she had the second thoughts of "What 
will happened?  They  will catch 
you."  No matter nobody looked after me. That    that's    
the    the following week or 
two weeks, they were so trem
endously tense politically that 
nobody gave a damn that a yo
ung Jewish boy escaped. As a 
matter o f fact, I believe that 
the most of the    of the came from the   
 from the brick factory did the same thing, 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 8 
although I cannot be sure, but certainly we 
did. And    and simply, we were rather 
fortunate.  The fact is that 
they knew the addresses.  If th ey
 wanted  probably  to go after 
us at that time, they were ab
le to know    no problem fo
r them.  But apparently nobody 
did. And at    the question become whethe
r or not Hungary is ju
mping out from the war, 
and there was big changes in the govern ment. 
 So this was a kind of a period that those 
who were at least in the capital city, they we
re a little bit freer to mo ve around than 
obviously those who were in the forced batta
lions in the Russian front.  They could not 
do th at.  But we did.   

Q: So tell me what you did next.   
A: Well, obviously, there were no school, as 
you know.  That was finished.  And    and 
what happened next is that  
  it was in July.  And in July
, a Swedish diplomat arrived to 
Budapest.  His name, I think, is very well kn
own.  And his first name  is Raoul. And wh at 
happened  is that my  uncle happen ed to be an  
in person in Hu ngary.  He was a physician.  
And whoever was a physician, and his daughter
    as a matter of fact, his adopted 
daughter speaks Swedish and started to wo rk 
for Wallenberg.  And due to this family 
connection, my mother started to do a little w o rk
 over    over there, 
mostly started to kind 
of a    a how should I put it?  A me
ssenger, taking messages and takes Schutz Pass 
because the Schutz Pass business started up 
in about September already, and she was 
busy then .  She helped.  And    and the thing 
is    did not change mu ch . Nevertheless, I 
think I have a bit of a blank for the happenin
g in August and part of September.  I really 
do not recollect anything of signi
ficance.  I did    my moth er    my father was away, 
obviously.  My mo ther was busy.  And I rea
lly don 't recall exactly 
what happened.  And 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
1 9 
this is a    a kind of a blind spot in my 
memo ry.  I do not reme mb er what did I really do, 
if    if any. I helped my 
mother.  I do remember that.   
Q: What's  the next th
ing you do remember?  
A: Well, the next thing which I do remembe
r, very vividly rememb er, it was the 15th of 
October.  That's what happen
ed . On th e 14th of October, there was a proclamation in 
Hungarian radio in which the governor, Ho rthy,
 declared that that
 Hungary is jumping 
out of the war.  So that was the tremendous
 jubilation, obviously. We were still on the 
same Jewish yellow star house that I alread
y described.  Though we were exceedingly 
happy that, my  goodness, that's the end of th
e story, after all.  The Russians got in the 
Hungarian border.  They are progressing beautifully.  
And this is really    now that half    
after Romania    Romania want
ed  to jump  out of the war and Italy, obviously .  So that 
was in 1990     in 1944, Oc
tober. So we thought that maybe 
we    we will be able to 
salvage ourselves in the meantime.  The    the    they   
 through the Swedish embassy, we 
knew that the SS left the country, basically.  
There was special SS 
dealing with Jewish 
things.  So we thought that's 
the end of the story. And then
 on the 15th, 
which there was 
next mo rning, we look out in th e window, and we
 saw the trucks for this    the Hungarian 
Nazis with the Arrow Cross part
 in the automobiles 
with full regalia and 
the German    I 
don't really know th e realm of the SS, but I kn
ow that the presence become very  heavy in  
the area that we lived. And that    that wa
s the turning point, obviously, wh ich, as you 
know, for the Budapest Jews, because the Hunga
rian Jews    the rest of the Hungarian 

Jews crossed the 700,000 already wa
s killed in Auschwitz.  But still 
at that time we didn't     
still, at that time we 
didn't know really about    about 
Auschwitz whatsoever.  No.  We 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
2 0 
did know deportation, but Auschwitz, that    th
ere were rumors going ar
ound.  But truly    
so that was in    in October. And then the  
  all the women and the    all the males were 
ordered to  one of the    one of th e large a
ssemb ly places.  And they
    then the march 
started.  As you know, the fact being that 
there were no possibility 
already to deport from 
the    from the capital.  The fa
ct is that the Russians already 
closed over all the roads to 
Auschwitz.  So it was after October, there was 
no way that the deportation could be. The    
the Budapest Jews deportation couldn't  be do
ne because the roads are already fortunately 
not the Red Army  that occupied them already.
 So that time I    about two week s later, a 
proclamation from the    from the Arrow Cro
ss party and the Parliament came  that you 
have to move in the ghetto.  Th
ey established a ghetto.  I believe
 it was in    in the first 
week of November, if I am not mistaken. But,
 nevertheless, we were very, very fortunate 
because we moved into interna
tional ghetto, which is basically
 the protected houses.  We 
had Schutz Passes fro m the    fro m the Swedis
h government, the fact being that probably 
decent connections I would think 
that, because as a matter of fa
ct, my wife and uncle is in 
Stockholm, but I don 't know how much would 
that affect us, because I didn't k n ow my 
wife at the time.  She was only ten years old. 
So anyway, at    I mad e it too complicated. 
They  had Schutz Passes.  As a reason    as 
a result of the Schutz Passes, we may have 
been protected in the house, th
e Swedish house, which was    
they were around the city.  
There were a couple of houses.  I believe 
there were around eight or ten center houses 
where the Swedish Schutz Pass bearers could 
move in.  And I mean, you have half a 
room, but nevertheless, you had so
me kind of protection. So my  father was at the time in    
in the forced  arm    forced camp  in Szoln
ok, which is about, I would say, 80 miles from 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
2 1 
Budapest.  And somehow, through the grap ev ine,
 we heard that they 
are going to transfer 
them through, and supposed  to 
taking them to Germany. So I, 
being the head of the    the 
family at that time, obviously.  So  I    I 
took off my  yellow star, and I went out to the 
railway station that generally 
the transport is going
 through. I think it 
was about three or 
four days after my first visit there, indeed, they
    the train arrived.  I didn 't know at that 
time that my father was on th
is train or not. But sudden
ly, Wallenberg appeared, his 
people    at least three ot
her people.  And suddenly, I sa
w my father coming out of the 
railway station. And said, "What's going on?" 
Said, "Well, had Schutz Pass, and they let 
me off the train." So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the Swedish 
house.  All right.  The things were more or less, besides the fact 
that obviously tension 
was tremendous and the ghetto ha
d horrible problems, the _____+ the hunger or the    or 
the only three months was the 
ghetto.  But still, over 120  or
 130,000 people were pushed 
in less than a square mile to a square area.
  The situation was horrible. And we were 
much better off because we liv
ed in a protected house, and we had a half a room for 
ourselves, and water was running.
  And as a matter of fact, the telephone was wo rking 
still in the building. And I do remember very
, very, very clearly that it was Christmas 
mo rning that the first Russian show arrived 
to our neighborhood.  That was a tremendous 
turn.  Budapest was already surrounded.  And they
 started, basically, the 
last st age of the    
of the Red Army .  The front moved closer and 
closer and closer.  And as the front moved 
closer and closer and closer, 
the    the Arrow Cross people 
become mo re and mo re wide, 
and unbelievable atrocities happene
d. And as a matter of fact, 
one of the Swedish houses    
it was, I believe, in December    th at tenant
s were taken out to th e 
Danube, and they were 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
2 2 
shot and    at the Danube, and nobody stayed
 alive and maybe they     probably  all    
maybe one or two persons out 
of the house wh ich was over 
350 people. So we knew that, 
of course, we were fine.  Through the consul
ate _____+.  So we arrived on the 28th of 
December.  On the 28th of Dece
mber, suddenly broke the do
or of the house, and the 
Arrow Cross appeared, and ever
ybody down from 
the apartments.  And    and it was the 
very similar procedure that ha
ppened in the other houses wh
ich were taken and executed.  
Okay ? An d it happened to be th at my  uncle wa
s a lawyer, and as a lawyer, he had a big 
mouth, and the big mouth he was staying 
the responsib le person 
fo r the whole bloody 
house.  He was the    he was the kind of supe
rvisor of the house, if
 you want to. So this 
story, by the way, is written down very well 
in one of Wallenberg's  
book.  It's by name, 
and it's    it's very well documented.  So I 
am just now quoting, as a matter of fact, from 
the book, telling of what happened. Basica
lly what happened was there was a one 
working telephone, and my dear uncle called th
e consulate, which was in a different part 
of the city.  And for some unbelievable luck
, Wallenberg just happened to be in the 
consulate in this    in a certain location. So we
 went down to the -- it's    I'm not sure that 
you know how is the major Europ
ean houses.  They have a central
 kind of a    a    they 
have a square    sorry.  They have a s
quare and in the middle there is a     
Q: A courtyard?  

A:    a courtyard.  Yeah, it's  a closed courtyar
d. So  we went there, and    and we started to 
move out.  And suddenly, there are    our savior
 arrived    Wallenberg    and somehow    I 
don't know exactly how    the 
Nazis disappeared sudden ly.   
Q: Who else was with you in th
is long but protected house?  

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
2 3 
A: Then my father, mo
ther, and my  uncle and aunt.  That's it.   
Q: Who are the other people?  
A: The other people?  They  are random.  I didn't 
really    we didn't
 know them before.  
Random Jews.  As a matter of fact, I am terrib l
y sorry.  My  grandfather and grandmother    
maternal grandmother and grandf
ather besides us too. Yeah, the rest, they were Jews.  I 
really cannot give you any detaile
d info rmation because I simp ly 
don't know.  They  were    
they were like us.  All of us for some reas
on or another or becaus
e they did have some 
relatives in Sweden and those who were just 
randomly selected and happened  to have a 
Schutz Pass.  They were there.  Nothing ex
ceptional, really simp
le, mostly middle class 
Jewish families. So making the long story sh
ort, the Arrow Cross gone.  And Wallenberg, 
as a matter of fact, arranged th
at the Wehrmacht soldiers stoo
d in front of the house for 
the next three days.  
Q: Did you have any other contact,
 you personally, with Wallenberg?  
A: So tw ice.  I had the two opportunity  to 
see him in action.  On
e was when my father 
was released, and the second wh
en  my  skin was kind of a hot situation.  Those are the 
two. I didn't    my mother met him much more b
ecause of her    her volunteer work on the    
on th e    it's  not the consulate.  It was physica
lly a makeshift office th
at    that they are 
manufactured the Schutz Passes.  And that's  
  that's it. And Wallenberg was always on 
the road and always moving, and death march, an
d just a historic fact that I don't have to 
tell you.  It's    he pulled out the people fro
m the death marches, supplied food as mu ch as 
possible.  And he was an absolu
te marvel an d    and probab
ly the heroes of hero, that 
someone who lived  this can understand that    
what this    what did this guy did. But, 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

anyway, subsequently, the front moved in an d 
closer and closer.  And at 10:15 on January 
15, I saw the first Soviet soldier, you kn
ow, in the street.  That's it.   
Q: Can you tell me about the change in contro
l of Budapest.  Was there mu ch fighting in  
your imme diate area that you witnessed?  
A: Oh, yes.  Well, it w as    it was a fierce fi
ght.  Yes, it was in the middle of the    it was 
not far from the opera house that our house 
was in, and I was _____+ living in, and it was 
through house to house, and fi
ne.  No question about that.  
And my  mo ther almost got a 
heart attack when I didn't go do
wn to the cellar and    and w
itnessed really the this house 
to house, almo st had come in
, and it's a    yes.   
Q: Can you tell me about your moment of liber
ation wh en you realized you were free.   
A: That's    that's    I can
not describe.  That's  true.  It's
 su ch a moment that first Red 
soldier came in and I was just look
ing into the window, and I thought 
that    that's    that's 
basically it.  The utmost pleasur
e in the world. As a matter of
 fact, the Red Army soldiers 
came into the building and then 
down to the cellar, and there we
re a couple of people to 
move.  They  got them in the hands and brought them up, and we fo und in  between them a 

nice Jewish major.  And he spoke Yiddish.  
I didn't .  But there were a good many people 
in the buildings spoke Yiddish.  And th
at's th e end of the story.  Yeah.   
Q: What did you do in your firs
t mo ments and days of freedom?  
A: Well, that's    it's a 
fact that our house was liberated, but the next house not yet 
liberated.  I mean, they went house to hous
e. And so the first 24 hours we were happy 
that alive, there was one part that constant 
bombardment.  I mean, that was the front of 
clashes of two huge armies, 
and the red Army and still the 
Germans didn't move over to 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
2 5 
the other side to the border side of the Danube 
to the    the left bank of the Danube.  It 
happened only three days later th
at they    they exploded and 
th ey    they bombed    took 
care of the bridges okay befo re they    af
ter they moved over. So  it was a very fluid 
situation.  We didn't k n ow maybe that the 
front was mo ving back or
 forth.  But 24 hours 
later, it become very clear that everything 
is. So I ventured outs
ide and looked a bit 
around, an d it was on the 20th of January  that I really went free and looked around.  And 
that is a    one of the major squares of Bu
dapest is called  the Opera Square.  We lived 
very close to that. I found tw o Nazis hanging 
on the lamp post, not much left from them, 
I must tel l you, because ever
ybody had moved around and spitted on them and so forth.  
It turned out to be that one 
was a German armory lieutenant 
colonel who killed the    the 
forced labor    Jewish forced-labor (?Sim
bor?) in Yugoslavia.  The other one was called 
(?Zeldin?) that this guy did 
a massacre in the    also in
 the Yugoslavia area, and they 
caught both of them, and 
th ey hanged him straight up from 
the lamp  post.  It's a beautiful 
sight. What else happened?  Subsequently, 
we looked around and to see what happened 
with our apartment.  O f course, needless to sa
y, that there are department stores totally 
from the _____    that was the building is gone
 even.  Everything.  Zilch, zero, nothing.  
But our apartment is stand.  So  we moved back
 to the apartment and started a new life.   
Q: During th e time that things had already 
gotten really bad for the Jews and where you 
thought the war might pass you by and yet it di
dn't, during that time, did you witness any 
beatings or executions of Jews 
at the hands of either the (?
gen dorms?) or the Germans?  
A: No, not personally,
 no, I did not.   
Q: Did you witness     

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m 
 
2 6 
A: That    some beating, yes.  But it was not 
   but nothing more than  that.  A slap in the 
face or a    that's    but those things 
were commonplace then.  But I never saw anybody 
executed in front of me, no.   
Q: And after the Soviets had gone through, did 
you see any beatings or
 any ex ecutions of 
people wh o had been co llaborators?  

A: I told you about the still    no, I did not.  
Really not.  A couple of    of them again 
severe beatings, yes, but nothing mo re th
an that. And we looked around at the big 
synagogue and the Budapest, and th
e corpses were in    like logs, one on the other. And    
and the ghetto situation was rea
lly incredible.  Incredible. And 
th ey    and    and by and 
large, the euphoria after all this happening th
at you stayed alive were tremendous, that it 
blinded you comp letely.  I mean I am
 alive.  I am alive. 
 This is    this 
is just so happening 
which un-explaining, it's a miracle, and it did really
.  It's    it    it
's just a by coincidence 
that you stayed alive and at least in the 
last four months of the war. So we looked 
everything in an optimistic eye, truly.  And, he
ll, who cares?  We are free.  I mean, it's    
it's such an incredib
le feeling.  It's such an un
describable.  That's it.   
Q: When did you come to rea
lize what had happened to  the Je
ws that had been deported?  
A: Very soon.  Very soon.  Basically, I believe
, in the second week of the heavy    we 
were liberated, that the news st
arted to become clear.  I mean, 
as a matter of fact, the first 
time our reaction been, naturally, not believing. I 
mean, it was such    
the    I think that 
the secret of this happening that just so un
believable that the Germans really couldn't    

these atrocities were su ch that they literally 
hid them.  Imagination 
-- and can‚Ñ¢t cope with 
it.  So therefore they really were to do this.  I mean, we truly    it to
ok us to digest this 

Interv iew with Yehuda Ada m

thing a long time. But about a 
week after we'd been liberated
, we already started to hear 
about Auschwitz and Treblinka and Belzec, 
Majdanek, but mostly
 Auschwitz, and the 
reason being that the Hu ngarian Jews went to
 Auschwitz.  Okay? So 
if you just think a 
minute and you say that the first trains left
 Hungary  to Au schwitz in May the 15th, the 
last trains before Horthy stopped deportation 
and July  the 10th, those are already the last 
two trains to take one.  Ro
ughly 750,000 Hungaria
n Jews were exterminated. The fact is 
that there were no selection for the Hungarian Je
ws back then.  So it's
    it's such an 
incredible thing that I am    I    it's hard to  
  hard to believe that I am    I have difficulties 
really to digest it today, 50 years later, a
bout that time.  It's 
incredible. And th en, 
obviously, th at, you know, the press starte
d up very  soon, because the other part of 
Hungary was already liberated.  So the pre
ss is moved with the Red Army until got the 
information.  I me an I'm sure 
you know the (?Castner?) business an
d all these things that    
that it was clear to them 
from the very moment from th
e Hungarian Jews' fate.

ou would like to add th at you 
haven't already told  me about your time duri
ng the war, and then just reflect back.  Is 
there anything you have

in eastern countries, Czechoslovakia, Poland,
 Russia, they took 
ab out four years to 
accomplish the Judenrein policy of
 the like, and Hungary it took
 less than three months to 
annihilate about 85 percent of
 the Jewish population. They
 say that's because Eichmann 
had become very experienced and things ran 
very smoothly.  Nevertheless, I think that 
that's a reflection to the Hungarians.  I do be
lieve that the Hungarian s not only 
cooperated 
but basically they'v e been the on
es that caused this Holocaust 
in Hungary. And I    I    I, 
personally, if I hear a Hungarian speak, I am ta
king a U turn.  It's h ard to avoid them.  I 
think that they are abso lu
tely a very high percentage of the population actively 
participated with pleasure in the a
nnihilation of the Hu ngarian Jews.   
Q: Did you lose any memb ers of your family?  
A: Well, of course.  Is there 
anybody who didn't?  Yes.   
Q: Can you tell me how you fo und out about
 what happened to
 those relatives?  
A: Well, my    my people that
 died, they died in the    in
 the forced labor camps.  Okay?  
My uncles, my    my father
's brothers.  And fortunately 
en ough, th e immediate family, 
meaning my parents and    stayed alive, fort
unately, and nothing happened to  them. But    
but I think th at our family may be an isolated 
incident.  I don't believe that practically one 
Hungarian Jewish family had no lo sses.  I do not.   

Q: How long did you stay in Hungary after the war?  

A: Well, we liberated.  And I finished my high
 school in Hungary.  And a year thereafter, 
we left illegally to Israel, and we arrived in 
Israel in early 1949.  I immediately  went to 
the Army.  And those were the last years of 
the liberation. And th en
 immediately went up 
to Jerusalem and started my  studies in the 
Hebrew Un iversity, Hadassah medical school.

I worked  through medical school, finished my  st
udies in 1956.  Then  did my  internship at 
the University Hosp ital in Jeru
salem.  Then I was a year in
 govern ment service because 
this was the year of the big Aliyah in Isr
ael th at was mostly fro
m the Arab countries. 
There was an influx of Jewish
 population. Then I finished 
my year in the Negev Desert, 
started my  residency in  Ramb am, which is a la
rge govern ment hospital 
in Haifa. In 1962 
came to the States to finish my residency. I did my  residency in
 New York City  in 
surgery at Albert Einstein college of medici
ne, and I finished, and I got my  fellowship at 
Memorial SloanKettering Cancer 
Center. And in 1969 I went back to Albert Einstein on 
the staff as a young assistant professor doing su
rgical oncology.  In 
1972 I was invited as 
a chief of surgery one of the Un
iversity Hospitals in Tel Aviv. 
 So obviously  
I returned to 
Israel.  And I served ten years as t h e chie
f of surgery. And in 1982, I came out of my 
sabbatical, spent a year of my sabbatical in
 Baltimore, and then I was offered a position 
as associate professor at UCSD, which is Un iv ersity of California, San Diego.  My 

mother became ill and, unfortunately, passed aw
ay, and therefore, being their only son, I 
had to go to return to
 Israel, and then subsequently we
 came back. And I am work ing and 
developed a medical group 
cancer group and teaching at Georgetown  Un iversity. 
Hopefully, next year, re
tiring and going home.   
Q: And home is?   
A: Tel Aviv.   
Q: You mentioned your wife. 
 She 's also a su rvivor?  
A: Yes, she is.  She is a younger generation,
 of course.  I don't know when  she was born, 

of course.  But she is also from Budapest. 
 And sh e experienced the ghetto, and she was

r, I believe, than we are.  We and the family of her    the 
immediate family is    stay 
together.  And nevertheless, the 
rest of the family who were 
outside of Budapest, they were 
practically all deported to Au
schwitz and did not return.
