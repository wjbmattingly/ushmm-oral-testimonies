Abstract
 
 
Lucia Garzolini, née Franco, was born on June 
17, 1921 on the island of Rhodes, then an Italian 
possession.  Her parents, four brot
hers, and she moved to the near
by island of Kos, where they 
were active in the Jewish community. Jews, 
Greek Orthodox, and Catholics lived in harmony.
 
 
German troops arrived on Rhodes and Kos in Se
ptember 1943, and soon began strictly enforcing 
racial laws. Suddenly, in July 1944, all Jews 
in Rhodes (about 2,000) and Kos (about 500) were 
deported. ﬁWe had no idea what was happening,ﬂ she 
says. They sailed nine days to Pi raeus 
(Peiraiéfs), and stayed two days without water in
 Chaidari, where SS me n beat her father for his 
shoes. Then, they rode in cattle cars ﬁfor 15 
days as beastsﬂ to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Lucia™s 
parents were gassed immediately, and her youngest 
brother, 25, was killed later. One of her 
brothers had moved to Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and one
 had emigrated to Palestine before the war. 

Lucia says she was the only survivor from Ko
s, a mong 150 survivors out of the 2,500 deportees.  
 
 
Lucia was put in Birkenau.  She discusses he
r tattoo, the crematoria, 
inhuma ne treatment, 
grueling work, and starvation ra
tions.  In October 1944, as the Russians advanced, the Germans 
cleared out Auschwitz.  She and he
r cousins underwent another select
ion. Lucia had st olen a beet 
and rouged their cheeks to look healthier.  They 
were given lice-infested 
coats, and marched to 
Landsberg.  At Landsberg, Lucia worked in th
e laundry where she caught the eye of a German 
officer.  He sent her extra food and had her tran
sferred to the kitchen, where the conditions were 
better.  Only a few days afte
r she left the laundry, all its
 workers died from typhoid.  
 
 
Landsberg was evacuated as Allied Forces appr
oached. Lucia was ma rched for three days to 
Dachau and then to Alach, which Americans 
liberated in April 1944. 
 The survivors moved 
among various refugee camps be fore arriving in
 Bologna, where Lucia found her older brother 
with the Palestinian Army.  Afte
r a month, Lucia went to Florence,
 and then returned to Kos to 
search for Jewish survivors, but found no one.  
After three months, she 
returned to Florence, 
where she was reunited with, and later ma rried, a fo
r mer Italian officer she™d known in Kos.  He 

had also been in Auschwitz as a military pris
oner.  The couple moved to the for mer Belgian 
Congo, and stayed in Africa for 27 years. 
 In 1974, they settled in Brussels.  
 
 
 
Lucia wrote a me moir of 
her experience, entitled 
One Day the Joy of Life Stopped at Auschwitz.
   
 
 
 
 
 

Tape 1, Side A
 
 
Question: Would you please begin by telling me  
your full name today and also at birth, if 
different?
 
 
Answer: My name in this mo ment is Garzolini 
and when I was born it was Lucia Franco.  I was 
born on the Island of Rhodes, when th
e islands were in Italian possession.
 
 
Q: When we re you born?
 
A: I was born on June 17, 1921.
 
 
Q: Can you tell me  a little about who was in
 your fa mily, the composition of your fa mily?
 
A: The fa mily was comp osed of my father, mother
, four brothers, and myself.  Luckily, three of 
my brothers left for Africa before
 the war.  I was left at home with my parents and a brother, and 
the four of us were deported.
 
 
Father™s name : Jorge (?) Franco 
Mother™s name: Rosa Galante 
Oldest brot her: Maur ice Franco 

Second brother: Salvatore Franco 

Third brother: Nissim Fr anco 

Youngest brother: David, the 
one deported to Auschwitz.  
 
 
Q: And whe r e did you grow up?   You were bor
n in Rhodes or Rhodos, where did you grow up?
 
A: Although I was born in Rhodes, I grew up on a
nother island, a small one: 
Kos, the village of 
Kos.  My family kept Jewish traditions and ho
lidays.  My father was head of the Kos synagogue. 
 
 
Q: How large was the Jewish community in Kos?
 
A: The community in Kos had about 30 fa milies. 
 The (Sephardic) Jewish community was larger 
in Rhodes, where I had aunts, uncles, cousins.
  There were multiple 
cont acts between the two 
islands Œ visits and so on.  So I can say I gr
ew up on both islands.  We
 took ma ny trips between 
them.  In Kos, I studied until age 11.  Then, until 
age 17, I went to school in Rhodes, but had to 
stop in 1938 because of the racial laws.
 
 

Q: I will be  asking more questions about that, fo
r sure, in just  a few mo ments.  What was the 
work that your father and/or mother did?
 
A: My mother was a housewife.  My father 
was a businessman Œ Import/export.  Shell (?) 
representative.  He was doing import/export comme
rce between the islands, especially between 
Kos and the other smaller island that belonged to
 the Duc de Canais (
ph.; nothing similar found 
on Internet).  In order 
to transport the me rchandise, he had hi
s own boat, and he was also going to 
Turkey to get some  me rchandise, since Kos 
is very close to the border of Turkey.
 
 
Q: What was the language or the languages that
 you spoke at home  and 
also in the community?
 
A: At home , we spoke Sephardic Spanish, whic
h has been spoken since 1492.  We  also spoke 

Italian-Greek, and so did the neighbors.  It 
was a harmonious life among people who had three 
different religions.
 
 
Q: What was the neighbor
hood like where you were growin
g up, where you were living?
 
A:  Some  of the Greek people that were in Ko
s came  originally from Turkey.  They were 
expelled from Turkey at the time  of t he refo
rms of Atartuk.  There were Turkish people, and 
there were Greek people that had been there for 
ma ny, many years and genera
tions.  In Turkey, at 
the end of the time of the Sultan, when he chased 
them from Turkey, they sent away all the Greek 
people as we ll.  So some  of them ca me  to the islands and so weŠ although we were Greek, we 

had a lot of Turkish traditions in 
our daily life Œ in our cooking, a
nd even some  of the words, to 
the point that my mother knew some  of the Turk
ish words but she thought they had always been 
Greek words Œ all Greek words.  But one year, 
she went to Turkey and discovered they were 
Turkish words.
 
 
Q: So were you actually socializing in 
school with other non-Jewish children?
 
A: On the island there wa s a school that was r
un by nuns.  They were Italian nuns that ran the 

school, and all the children went there.  It was 
a Catholic school, but at
 the school they was no 
difference between Jewish, (Greek) Orthodox, or a
ny other religion, and we all grew up together.
 
 
Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism before the war?
 
A:  No anti-Semitism.  The Jewish community was respected.
 
 
Q: Would you tell me  a little bit more about your
 relationships with your
 siblings, with your 
brothers, I believe?
 
 

A: We  had excellent relationships.  The two olde
st brothers we nt to Rhodesia in 1937.  The other 
brother, Nissim, went to Palestine at the time  of 
t he racial laws.  He volunt
eered in the Palestinian 
Brigade (British Army), and fought
 in Africa and then in Italy.
 
 
Q: Did you hear of Hitler pretty
 early on, any time  1933 or after?
 
A: No, we did not hear.  We were
 pretty ignorant.  We  never fe
lt anything.  When the Italians 
came, they sent two groups of officers Œ Italian m
ilitary Œ at some  point in time.  But we never 
felt anythi ng because the Italians alwa ys behaved ve
ry well toward us.  I said before that we were 
not supposed to go to school when the racial laws 
started, but the Italians were very apologetic to 
us.  They told us that those were the rules that
 they had received and unf
ortunately they had to 
apply them at some  point in time .  Not at the be
ginning, but at some  point 
they were obliged to.  
And also some  of the Jews belonged to clubs Œ y ou know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were 
excluded from them at that time  also.  But the It
alians were again apologetic about that.  They 
said they were obliged to do it 
because of some  rules they ha
d received from the ma inland.  
Generally, we had norma l life even after racial laws.
 
 
Q: What year did the racial la
ws go into effect in your area?
 
A: At the beginning the racial laws we reŠ be
sides not going to school and the club Œ being 
excluded from the clubŒ the attit
ude between the Italian officers
 and the Jewish population was 
the same , because the islands and the group was very small, so everybody knew everybody.  And 
the Italian behavior stayed the same .  It™s only 
after the attempt on Hitler™s life, that  things got 
tougher because of the Germans.  That was on July 20, 1944.
 
 
Q: I think I forgot my question. 
 I think I understand that
 it wa sn™t a drastic 
change of lifestyle 
when the racial laws were imple mented.  Howe
ver, I™m wondering if you and your family, or 
others in the Jewish community were talki
ng about this and very concerned about this.
 
A: We  had news, in some of the Italian newspa
pers, but since it was so fa r away, we thought, you 
know, we were not concerned.  We  
were very isolated in the isla
nds and even the attitude of the 
Italian officers was very relaxed, 
so we wouldn™t think that some thi
ng was really happening to us.  
That™s why we were not as concerned.
 
 
The situation worsened when Badoglio, who wa
s ma rshal in the Ita
lian army, and the king, 
Vittori o Emma nuel the Third, when they asked for 
the ar mi stice with the 
Allies.  And at that  
time, things got a little tougher.
 
 

At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italia
ns were asking for the armi stice and they got it, 
they felt they were betrayed by the Italians.  At 
that point in time, they sent some  troops to the 
islands.
 
 
It was only nine months before our
 eventual deportation that at so
me  point in time the Germans, 
after seeing what the Italians did, sent more tr
oops to the islands.  But the local population was 
not aware of anything, and even the Germans that
 were on the island were acting very norma l and 
polite with all the population.  We
 did not know, but in the mean
time, they had taken all the 
information on Jewish families.  They took all the addresse s and knew who was living where and 
they already had all the infor mation on Jews.  
They were not showing 
anything, but they had 
already started.  German troops came to Rhodes on September 8, 1943.
 
 
At some poi nt, after the armi stice, the Germans 
had their headquarters in Rhodes.  And at that 
point, they called all the Italian officers and 
told them, ﬁYour  king a
nd the Marshal Badoglio 
have asked for armi stice, so what are you going to
 do? ﬂ  And at that point, the Germans told the 
Italian offi cers that  they were
 German prisoners.  But the offi
cers st ayed on the island.  They 
were not supposed to leave the island, but they we re not put as a military officer in prison, they 
were just free to stay on the island at that time . 
 Therefore, the Jews were
 registered, but we knew 
nothing about what was going on in Europe.
 
 
At the mo ment of the armi stice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, 

they tried to land in Kos.  But the Germans ha
d se nt some boats from Rhodes to bomb them.  
And then the British tried to land 
in Rhodes, but they couldn™t su
cceed, so they had to retreat.  
And so we stayed.  And the Jewish population 
and the rest of the population stayed in Kos.
 
 
The Italians didn™t say anything 
and ma ybe didn™t know anything about
 the plans of the Germans, 
but at some  point, the Germans that were on the is
lands of course, told th
e population of Kos that 
if they wanted to leave, they could leave.  
This was because we were going to run out of food 
because the island was ki nd of isolated. It was 
surrounded by the British submarines, and we had 

difficulty finding food.  So they had asked the popul
ation of Kos if any of us wanted to leave the 
island and go to Turkey.
 
 
Q: Did you or your fami ly express interest in l
eaving?   Did you know people personally Œ people 
in the Jewish community Œ who were leaving?
 
A: My father said leaving was not necessar
y.  He thought the war would end soon.  Maybe a 
couple of people left the island.
 
 

Q: At this point, before you were deported of 
course, is there any stag
e where you were really 
starting to feel fear?  
 You or your family?
 
A: We  had no fear because we had, at some  poi
nt– The British had bombed a few times, but we 
were not afraid because we were thinking that th
e war was about to end. So we said it™s not the 
time to be afraid, and we are far away.
 
 
Q: Did you hear about the war in other places 
Œ in Europe for instance?   Did you even– When 
did you know that the wa r had started Œ in Septem
ber of 1939?   When did you learn about those 
events?
 
A: We  were not aware, because in a certain wa
y, we knew about the war, 
but we were not very 
concerned.  And then, unfortunately
, I feel bad about the ignoran
ce, but we had no more radios, 
but more than thatŠ that was not 
an excuse, but more than that it™s because we saw the Italians 
around us who were not concerned, so we 
didn™t know why we would be concerned.
 
 
Q: I wanted to ask a little bit more
 about the racial laws and to ge
t a little more detail on what you 
recall you had to do differently because of the laws.
 
A: The Italians never ma de us feel that there 
was a difference.  We  thought that we had to stop 
going to school because of the war and that™s how it was.  We thought we ™d be able to go back 
after the war was over.
 
 
Tape 1, Side B
 
 
Q: We  were last talking about th
e racial laws and I want to ma ke
 sure we have the chronology of 
events correct.  So I want to establish exactly
 when it was when you no longer could go to school.
 
A: We  could no longer go to school after 1938.  I 
had done quite a bit of secondary school, so it 
was not hard for me .  But small children had to go home .
 
 
Q:  What exactly did you do every day after you no longer we re in school?
 
A: I was home with the fa mily.  I 
was still going to take piano less
ons because I had started at the 
nun™s school. I started when I was three years old a
nd kept on taking piano lessons with the sister 
who was giving piano lessons.  The 
sister wanted me  also to help
 out with other small children 
and give them some  lessons in pian
o. These were not Jewish children.
 
 

Q: And then we were also talking about the possi
bility for people to leave the island of Kos and 
go to Turkey.  Could we establish exactly when you learned about this
 in relationship to the racial 
laws and other events?
 
A: We  were notŠ The Germans were not treating us
 the way they treated Jews in Europe.  We  
didn™t have to wear the star; we didn™t have ghettos.  And the Germans would come  to my 
father™s store, buy me rchandise, pay and be well-beh
aved. They were not aggressive to us. At one 

point, one of my father™s employees
 said, ﬁSince we have this boat 
that we use to do commerce in 
the islands, why don™t we put all our me rchandise
 and things out of your house onto the boat and 
bring them t o Turkey? ﬂ   The employee had asked 
also that my only brother that rema ined in 
Rhodes -- not the ones who had left, but the only 
rema ining brother, the youngest one Œ he would 
go with this boat captain to Turkey and establish 
ma ybe a bus iness on the other side, or start a life 
on the other side.  This wa s winter 1943-44.  Kos 
to Turkey was only 4 km. But my father said, 
ﬁNo, the war will end soon.ﬂ
 
 
Q: At the time of this event of me nt ioning your
 brother and this German, was he actually a 

soldier?
 
A: No.  He was not a German; he was a Greek
 captain who was working for my fat her in 
February or March of 1944.
 
 
Q: And how old were you about this time and how
 active are you in any of the decision ma king 

in your household?
 
A: I was 22-23 years old.  I had no special role 
in the family™s decisions.  My father decided.
 
 
Q: Did the sisters talk to you about th
e problems?   Did they give you advice?
 
A: The nuns did not know.  The sisters of the school had no idea about what was going to 

happen.  It was only at the mo ment
 of the deportation when the Germans arrested us, that one of 
the sisters in charge of the school, the Mother 
Superior, came and said to the Germans that my 
mother was sick and was not very well and if she 
could stay because she had to get treatment and 
then they would send her afterward.  But she 
was thinking of sending my mother to Turkey 
instead.  But my mother did not
 agree to stay behind– The sisters did not know what was going 
on in Europe.
 
 
Q: Did they tell your father 
what to do?   What role did 
your mother have in the school?
 
A: Although she was Jewish, my mother worked w
ith the Mother Superior some times, collecting 
money and doing charity work.  And she went around 
with the Mother Superior since my mother 
spoke Greek and also spoke Italian, Spanish a
nd Turkish.  She was going 
around to collect funds 
for the children attending school Œ they were 
basically Turkish and Greek poor children who 

didn™t have much and didn™t have shoes some times
.  And so my mother was doing charity work 
for the school to that effect.
 
 
Q: It sounded like there was a food 
shortage at some  ti me .  Ca n 
you explain more about that and 
when that took place?
 
A: The food shortage was worse at Rhodes, and 
moreso in Jewish neighborhoods.  It was not so 
bad in Kos (1942-43), since it was a small comm
unity and we  knew (and were friends with) 
far mers.
 
 
Q: Did you hear much about what was happeni ng on the ma inland of 
Greece?  Specifically, I 
believe there were other deportations of Je
ws in 1943.  Did you hear anything about that?
 
A: No, I did not know.  I only found out when 
I was in Auschwitz, where I met wome n from 
Salonika (Thessaloníki) Œ where 50,000 Jews were
 exterminated in 1943 Œ who told me  what 

happened.
 
 
Q: I want to go back just for a mo ment, becau
se some  of the reading I had done, I had seen 
some thing about actually this is not during the 
war but back to 1933, something about there being 
an earthquake on the island of Kos and actually 
the synagogue being destroyed.  I was wondering 
if that affected you or your fa mily 
of if you reme mber if this is right?
 
A: It was 1933 when the synagogue was dest
royed.  The books and the Se fer Torah were 
transported to my house and that™s because my ho
use was still standing.  That™s where we usually 
had our prayers for Shabbat and all the other 
events were taking place.  Ma ny died in the 
earthquake.  Other people stayed in
 the stadium.  After this is wh
en I went to Rhodes to continue 
my studies with the nuns.
 
 
Q: There had actually been a school
 at the synagogue Œ at the Te
mple Œ and that™s why you left?
 
A: No Jewish school existed.  The Jewish comm
unity was small and the existing schools were 
Catholic.  I stayed five years in
 Rhodes;  I lived at an aunt™s 
home .  There were ma ny girls living 
there too Œ cousins who emigra
ted to Rhodesia in 1938, which wa
s when I returned to Kos.
 
 
Q: How long was the trip from Kos t o Rhodes?
 
A: In those years, there were small boats and it 
took five-six hours.  Today, with modern boats, it 

is much faster.
 
 

Q: Before you were deported, the Germans, as 
I understand it, were in Kos from September of 
1943 until you were deported.  What kind of encounters di d you have with the Germans in Kos?
 
A: The relation with the Germans wa s very 
good, because, I meanŠ nor ma l.  And there was 
nothing against us on behalf of the Germans.  
And it was only after the Hitler coup (assassination 
attempt) that the Germans had to carry out so
me  of the orders they
 received and round up the 
people.  But until then, the relations were good, an
d I think that maybe we were among the last 
Jewish people that  were fr ee in the world at  that  point in time.
 
 
Q: And so it sounds like you did not experience an
ti-Semitism from Germans who were in Kos at 
that time?   Is that Œ am
 I  understanding correctly?
 
A: There was no contact with the Germans because
 the lifestyle of the people on the island was 
very different from on t he ma inland.  So we had 
our way of doing things, and we were not having 
any life together with the Germans.  Plus, the It alia
ns were st ill there. In 
Europe, it was different.  
The deportation for us was very hard because we 
had no idea.  We  had never felt anyt hing before 
that day.  And the difference in Europe, where they
 had to hide, where they were feeling things 
growing bit by bit– we had no feel
ing of that kind on the island, so 
it was even stronger for us Œ 
the shock Œ because suddenly everybody was rounde
d up and we had to be deported and we were 
wondering why and whereŠ where 
we were going.  Because we had never felt anything of the 
war until then, except for the racial laws, 
but we had attributed that to the war.
 
 
Q: Do you reme mber exactly when the German
s came in, in September?   Do you actually 

reme mber any particular day or
 was it not very monume ntal?
 
A: At some point in time the Germans arrived, but th
ey were not in the city, so they were ma inly 
staying in their headquarters.  So 
we didn™t really feel it.
  Wh en the British left the area, then the 
Germans arrived mi d-September.  We didn™t feel
 it much, but after the deportation, my  mother 
found out from the Mother Superior knew that the 
Italians had been trying to defend the king™s 
idea and ki nd of do a resistance against the Germans.
  And at that point in
 time, the Germans took 
some  of the Italians prisoner.  But I only f
ound out after the deportation ______ (? ), the Mother 
Superior told me  when I went back to the isla
nd, that the Germans had taken some  Italian officers 
prisoner, and they had asked one officer to dig 
a kind of a hole in the 
ground, and they shot 300 
of them. [The number of officers 
executed was actually about 100.]
 
 
Q: That™s on Kos, as well?   Is that what you ei
ther refer to or I™ve seen
 mentioned as a ma ssacre 
on Kos?
 
A: Exactly.
 
 

Q: All this time  be fore being deported, and espe
cially after the Germans 
arrived, was your father 
still able to do his work?
 
A: Yes, but less than before.  In early afternoon he™d come  back to the village where we were 
staying.
 
 
Q: I think we ™ve covered most of the time pe
riod up until September 1943, when the armi stice 
was ma de official.  So I™m curious to know what
 you noticed right away when the Germans were 

comi ng into your region?
 
A: There were, at some  point in time, a lot 
of bombs being dropped around the island by the 

Allies and what we did, we went with the fa mily 
and other people to a vi llage outsi de the city.  
And that™s where the Germans came to arrest  us.
 
 
Q: That™s all the way in July of 1944, is that correct?
 
A: When they rounded us up on July 21, 1944, they lin
ed us up in the courtyard of the governor™s 

palace, and we stayed there for 24 hours without
 food or water.  And we thought we were going 
to be kept some where on the island, as a kind of
 prisoner camp of some kind.  We  had no idea 
what was happening.  It was a Sunday.  Germans 
came unexpectedly and circled our pl ace, said 
all of us would have to leave.  We  prepared ou
r suitcases; the Germans told us to bring not too 
ma ny things.  We  were about 500 people, about 30 fa milies.
 
It was at that point in time that
 the Mother Superior came with 
the music teacher and with some 

official paper from the German commandanture 
to have my mother exempted and stay on the 
island. But my mother decided that she 
wanted to go where her family wa s going.
 
 
Q: How would your mo ther have been ab
le to be exempt?   What was that?
 
A: My mother would have been able to because  
Š the Mother Superior  said that  she was a sick 
person and she had to be trea
ted before being sent away.
 
 
Q: And that was actually fabri
cated by– or was that true?
 
A: It was not true.  At that point
, the Mother Superior realized th
at we were going to be deported.  
She didn™t know where, but she realized whatwas happening, and she tr
ied because my mother 
did a lot for them. She tried to at  least save her.
 
 
Q: Did you know of any resistance activities going on?
 
A: No, not to our knowledge.
 

 
Q: Now I think, if you™re ready to discuss, ma ybe
 you can tell me some 
more details about the 
deportation, as much detail as possible.  The very
 first that you heard of
 anything that was going 
to be happening?   How ma ny pe
opl e from Kos and from Rhodes?
 
A: From Rhodes, there were 2,000 people.
 
 
Q: Maybe you™ve already said this
, but was it done in different st
ages?   So they gathered, I had 
read somewhere they gathered men first and then
 women and children, or 
was that in Rhodes?   
Was it different in Kos?
 
 
A: In Kos we were all gathered together.  It wa
s in Rhodes that they t
ook me n first and the next 
day wome n and children.  We  went on a bus to the 
city.  Then we boarded a boat, one from Kos, 
two from Rhodes, to Piraeus (Peiraiéfs), where 
we arrived nine days later on August 2, 1944.  It 
was very hot. I was with my fa mily on deck, whic
h was much better than being in the ship™s hold.
 
 
Tape 2, Side A
 
 
Q: On the last tape, we were talking about the 
details and the specifics 
of the deportation and I 
would like to continue if we can.
 
A: We  left on the boat Œ one boat from Kos and 
two boats from Rhodes Œ and the two boats from 
Rhodes joined the one from Kos and we went.  It 
took nine days to go to Pi raeus.  There were 
some  Allied forces in the area.  Also when we 
left Kos, the Germans had said that nobody could 
be in the streets, and everybody had to be inside 
because they didn™t want  the people to see the 
deportation happening.  So when we  
left, the city was totally empt
y in the streets and we thought 
it looked like a desolated city. 
 And when we arrived in Athens, the Germans had told the 
population the same  thing, so everybody was inside
, and nobody was supposed to be in the streets 
to see people arriving.
 
 
Q: What was it like on the boat where you were be
ing transported?   Explain ma ybe the situation 
and the environment, how ma ny people there were.
 
A: It was very hard.  It was a bad situation.  We
 had already started in the boat.  Some of the 
people were on the deck, but a lot of them were
 in the boat™s hold and had no water or food.  
Even on deck, there was not much to eat, and it 
wa s also the month of 
July and it was pretty 
warm.  So it was hard conditions.
 
 

When we came out of the boat, the Germans had some  vans to transport us, and they brought us a 
few kilome t e rs away from the port to a military
 barrack that had been abandoned.  It was in 
Chaidari and we stayed there 
for two days with no water.  
We felt as abandoned as beasts.
 
The next day, the first day we were there, there 
was no water, so it was very hard.  And then the 
next day they said we had to go out in the c
ourtyard because they had to inspect us and our 
luggage.  After we went in the courtyard, th
ey looked through our l
uggage and our personal 
things, and they took whatever th
ey wanted to take, and at that
 point in time we had to get on 
trucks.  My mother and aunts we
re already on the truck, but my fa
ther and I were not.  Then an 
SS Ger man with his whip started to beat my fa
ther, but we didn™t know what he wanted because 
none of us spoke Germa n.  That was very hard, having no knowledge of the German language.  

Basically, the German wanted my fat her™s shoes a
nd so finally we understood.  He wanted to take 
the shoes and bring them some where else, but wedidn™t know where.  And that™s when my father 

started crying.  I had never seen my father cry be
fore all the harassment he went though.  I stated 
in my book t hat ﬁOlympian Nazis needed Jewish shoes for their Aryan feet.ﬂ
 
 
The trucks arrived at the stati
on and the train ma de up of cattle wagons (cars) was there.  They 
kept families together.  Each wagon had about 
60 people in it.  We  didn™t know the train™s 

destination. In this wagon, there 
was a barrel with water, five 
loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, 
and some  raisins.  But the water was put in a barr
el that was used for pickles, so the barrel was 
very salty, and with the move me nt of the trai
n, the water became completely salty, and it was 
even worse after that.  We were very thirsty, and 
when the train would arri
ve to a station, I could 
hear the sound of water.  I 
would try to look out through the 
small opening high up in the wagon 
and yell for water, but to no avail.  The trip la
sted around 15 days.  The train went though Greece, 
Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovokia,
 and finally Poland to Auschwitz.
 
 
Q: During the train ride, what we
re you talking about, with either
 your family or other people on 
the train?
 
A: During the time we were in the train, we were 
not really feeling like talking much, because we 
were worried and we didn™t know what was going to
 happen to us.  And every two to three days, 
the Germans would stop the train and open the 
wagons and they would have people go out toŠ 

to do theirŠ to go to the bathroom
 in front of them and they were standing there next to them.  
And also when they used to open the wagon a
nd people were comi ng out, 
sometimes there were 
some  dead people.  They would just take them 
and throw them in the fields.  Those older people 
that had not survived because of no food and no 
water and they couldn™t hold on, they were just 
being thrown.  And then they 
would close the wagon again and c
ontinue the journey.  And also 
for the bodily needs we had, there was in my wa gon, a lady with a kid, and she had a small night 

pot.  So we all were using it and throwing out 
its contents through the little window on the top 
area of the wagon.  It was terrible.  We spent 15 
days as beasts, not feeling like human beings.
 
 

After 15 days we arrived at Auschwitz, an unknown 
na me  for  us.  When we came out  of the train 
the Germans told us not to take our luggage, to
 leave everything in the wagon.  But we thought 
we wanted to have some thing to change into, si
nce we had been in the 
train for so long, so we 
started to put clot hing, one piece over another.  
We piled them onto ourselves.  When out of the 
wagon we saw a big line of Ger man Officers, 
well dressed and clean, and we wondered, ﬁWhy 
are they there?ﬂ  Then we started seeing a line, a
nd that they were starting to split young people 
from old ones.  I was with my mother and in orde
r not to be separated, I put a scarf over my head 
and started walking like an olde
r person, holding my mother.  But 
one of the German officers saw 
this, and he lifted my hea d and saw that I was 
young.  So I was separated fr om my parents.  At 
that point my mother said, ﬁIf you have to split 
me from my c hildren, you mi ght as well kill me.ﬂ  
My mother and father, other older people, and yo
ung children, were in anot
her line and that same  
night they were gassed and died.  I and the ot
her young people were put in
 another room and for 
the first time we found water.  It
 was a place to take a shower.  
They threw us packs of clothes 
that were not ma tched in any way.  We were al
so totally shaved.  But after so ma ny days, we 
finally had water.
 
 
Q: I wanted to ask one more thing about the 
deportation itself and 
the transportation to 
Auschwitz.  I was wondering, did you 
know people who died along the way?
 
A: Yes.  My uncle Yehuda Netrike (ph) and Mr. 
Michael Menashe.  They were thrown out on the 
fields.  So were ma ny other people.
 
 
Q: Also I was wondering, do you know, was it ever
yone from Kos Œ every Jew from Kos Œ who 
was taken in the transport?
 
A: Yes, yes, yes, all.  All the Jews.  Nobody was left.
 
 
Q: And was that one of the first realizations 
you had that as a Jew you 
were being singled out?
 
A: Maybe before I did not understand.  But in Au
schwitz, when we were all from Kos, together 
in the camp, yes, we knew.  
 
 
The language  barrier was very hard, because even 
in the camp, when we received orde rs, we did 
not understand them, as we did not know any Germa
n.  And t hat was a big tragedy for us, as we 
didn™t want  to do something against the rules. 
 Some ti me s we were doing the opposite because of 
what the guards wanted and that™s why I think 
language– People should learn languages, as the 
world is very big.
 
 
After the showers and clothing, we had to go 
to the barracks.  There were 30 in six 
lage rs 
(barracks).  There were 300 people 
in the barrack and three levels of wooden shelves Œ or beds Œ 

the ma jority occupied, so we did not know wh
ere to go to spend the 
night.  We  did not 
understand what to do.  But some how,
 we found a few places. Lights 
off.  It was night and cold, 
but we were very tired.  We 
were woken at 5 a.m. for the 
appel
, when everybody was counted.  
We stood in rows of five with few clothes.  I 
was wearing a blue silk 
skirt and a ma n™s pajama  
shirt, with no underwear.  The shoes were wet af
ter being imme rsed in disinfecting liquid.  We  
had to stand for an hour until 6 a.m.  Then we we
re given coffee, which was just water with color 
but warm, s e rved in dirty tin cans.  It was 
the same  for the 12 noon soup Œ warm with some 
potato peelings and some grains.  These were se
rved outside.  Then we
 had nothing to do; we 
were free in the camp.
 
 
The latrines were in a big barrack, with a long lin
e of holes.  Some  wome n stayed in there for a 
long time, since it was warmer.  But the guards 
with their long brooms would throw excrement 
on their heads so they would go out.  There wa
s a lot of mi sunderstandi ng because di fferent 
people spoke different languages and came from 
varied cultures.  We  did not understand each 
other.  To keep warm, wome n were asked to 
join others standing against a wall, ma ybe 20 
together, to keep warm.  We  felt like dogs, stay
ing on the floor having nothing to do.  The soup 
came for the evening.  The new arrivals mi ght not 
take it, but the ones who were there for some  
time would take it for themselves Œ it was important
 to eat.  Also, we saw piles of naked wome n 
cadavers being transported by wome n.  In the afternoon, there was another 
appel
 and counting.  
There was di stribution to each of us of about 200 
grams of bl ack bread, 10 grams of margarine, 
and one slice of sausage.  We  put the 
ma rgarine on the bread with our fingers.
 
 
A deportee fr om Hungary, called Magda, who was 
14 years old and had lost her whole fa mily, 
was a kapo.  On some  evenings, she distributed 
jam.  She picked it up with a spoon to throw on 

our bread, but ma ny ti mes it ended up on the 
ground and ma ny took it from the floor.  People 
were very upset with her and it seems that 
she was killed by prisoners at liberation.  
 
 
After we ate, we entered the barracks to go to 
sleep.  In my mi nd, I had ma ny questions.  I was 

sad, but I knew I must sleep.  One day, we were told to go to work.  We  left the camp in 

for mations surrounded by old soldiers from the Wehr macht and dogs.  We walked.  It was cold 

and foggy.  The soldiers asked us to sing Italia
n songs Œ one song composed by Beniamino Gigli: 
ﬁMamma .ﬂ  We sang and cried.  We  arrived at a 
camp and were told to pick up one brick, which 
we carried out to the camp, and the next day we re
turned it to the first place.  It was demoralizing 
work Œ no need to think, only to get tired.  It was 
work similar to that of beasts.  In the next camp, 
surrounded by electrified wires, 
we saw people from Rhodes, me
n and relatives.  They looked 
bad Œ shaved, and dressed terribl
y.  We gave the same  sad impression to them.  The y worked in 
mi nes, salt and coal, all day long.  My brother 
Dave, 25 years old, was there, and a week later 
developed pneumonia and went to the infirmary.  
I went there and called him.  He came  out and 
said, ﬁI™m sick.ﬂ  On Friday, we got a bowl of 
soup for three people with 
three potatoes, which I 
saved to take to my brother.   I called and calle
d, but he did not come .  A nurse came  out and told 

me  not to think about my  brother anymore, and 
also said, ﬁYou should eat your potato.ﬂ  During 
the night, a truck had come  to take the very 
sick ones who could not work anymore, and they 
were killed.  Years later, afte
r liberation, when I was in Florence, I had a dream.  I saw my 
brother with a long white shirt and he said, 
ﬁYou, you™ll live!ﬂ  And 
I never forgot this.
 
The daily life in Auschwitz, I already me ntioned. 
 The stronger ones did not let us pass to get 
water to wash our faces.  We  were 2,000 individual
s.  You had to, in a way, fight for survival.
 
 
Tape 2, Side B
 
 
Q: I™d like to go back and just catch up with 
a few details about your arrival to Auschwitz, and 
I™m curious especially, fr om the things that I™ve r
ead, about the dates that 
you were in transport to 
get there and what date you actually arrived.
 
A: I left Kos on the 23
rd
 of July and arrived to Piraeus on August 2
nd
.  Two days later I went on 
another train that arrive
d in Auschwitz on August 16
th
.
 
 
Q: I wanted to address the specific date because 
there are actually a few things that I™ve  read, 
some  people who I think were also from the same
 region, who said that they arrived on August 
17
th
, and I just wanted to ma ke sure and ma ybe 
you have some reason for how that mi ght have 
come  about , this discrepancy.  Why, it seems lik
e I™ve seen some  things that say August 16
th
 and 
some  that say August 17
th
.
 
A: I™m sure it was the 16
th
.  But you know we had no calendar.
 
 
Q: And whe n were you assigned your prisoner nu
mber, especially, that is, receiving the tattoo?
 
A: We  got the tattoo three days af
ter we arrived and we were very 
surprised to have it.  It wasŠ
some  of us tried to just take it away, but it was d
one with ink and with a little pen.  And some  of 
us tried to take it off, just a li
ttle bit, but it was st ill ther e, a
nd we were surprised because they 
say, well this is only for prisoners, like in the Fr
ench prison or penal colony of the French island 
that was overseas.  And we were very surprised we
 were having this.  We  also said, in a certain 
way Œ not that we are lucky, but 
at least they did it 
on the arm.  They could have done it on the 
cheek or on the forehead, a
nd nobody would have stopped them.
 
 
Q: When did you actually rea
lize that your other fa mily 
me mbers had been killed?
 
A: At the beginning, when we didn™t really know Œ at
 some  point in time, the people that were in 
the camp, the ____ (? ) people, the ones that were 
directing the other pris
oners, were telling us 
____ (? ) these are flames, these areŠ We  kind of
 understood they were– At the beginning, we 
thought that the smell we were smelling was th
e Germans cooking food for themselves.  It was 

like a meat smell– that there was food.  And then
 we found out that it was not, but at no point in 
time did we want to either know orŠ orŠ or be su
re that the parents, and the others who were 
not there, were actually being burned.  And we
 some times had the feeling that ma ybeŠ ma ybe 
they were in another camp.  A
nd there was a lady from Kos that 
had four children, between 4 and 
10 years old.  Four beautiful kids.  And sh
e had asked once, ﬁWhere do you think my children 
are?   Are they some whe r e else, or did they actu
ally kill them?ﬂ  And the answer was, ﬁOh no, I™m 
sure they are some where else.ﬂ  But actually, 
when we arrived at Auschwitz, the same  night, 
those kids were with their grandmother Œ I mean 
this woma n™s  mother Œ and they were together 
with the grandparents.  They took them, so we  never really knew what happened to them.
 
 
Q: We re you actually in Bi
rkenau?   And what block number were you in, do you know?
 
A: It was Block 20.  The first night,
 we were 300 young women from Rhodes.
 
 
Q: We re you also around other Jews and coul
d you always communicate in a language with 
them?
 
A: In Birkenau, we found some Š at some  point
 we heardŠ Some  people heard us speaking in 
Italian, French, and Spanish, so they came over,
 and they asked, ﬁWhere are you from?   We  
speak French; are you from France?ﬂ  And then we said, ﬁNo, we come  from Rhode s.ﬂ  And the 

other ones say, ﬁWe come from Sal onique (Thessal
oniki).ﬂ  And there were people, like some  
wome n, who™d been ther
e two years already.
 
 
Q: So out of the group that you came with duri
ng the deportation Œ the larger group Œ how ma ny 
survived?
 
A: About 150, ma inly wome n, some
 me n.  The majority are in Brussels, South Africa, and 

America.
 
 
Q: And out of the group of those you were with
 from Kos, s pecifica
lly, how ma ny s urvived?
 
A: Only my self.
 
 
Q: You don™t know of anybody else from
 Kos who survived the deportation?
 
A: A cousin Lise, but she was born 
in Rhodes, and went back there.
 
 
Q: But from, originally fr om Kos, the only one.
 
A: There was a fa mily from Kos who moved to Rhodes, but all died.
 

 
Q: So, did you mostly have contact with other Greek Jews in Auschwitz?
 
A: There were a small nu mber of Gr eek Jews
.  Only three wome n who approached us in 
Birkenau.  So me  were in Auschwitz.
 
 
Q: Did you ever know of any resistance activitie
s that Greek Jews specifically were involved 
with?
 
A: It is possible that there was, but I didn™t know.
 
 
Q: Did you then mostly have contact with 
other wome n prisoners, more than any me n?
 
A: We  had no contact with me n, we were 
always separated.  C
ontact was prohibited.
 
 
Q: We re you able to carry on any cultu
ral or religious activities at all?
 
A: We  didn™t do anythi ng, but we were really 
amazed to see that there were some  Ashkenazi 
wome n, who were there for ma ybe tw
o or three years, and every Frid
ay were taki ng a little bit of 
the ma rgarine they were receiving, and they we
re me lting it down and then tried to do a little 
candle, and light it, and they were crying.  And every week, they were doing that and I was 
amazed that they were doing that.  They were organized. And also in or de r to ma ke some  kind of 

a candle, they were ripping little threads from bla nkets and they we
re using that to do the candles.
 
 
Q: You never actually participated?   You 
saw this but you weren™t involved personally?
 
A: Since the wome n had been in the camp for a l
ong time, the wome n had the habit of doing that.  
But for us, we admi red them that even in those 
kind of mo me nts, they were doing this.  But we 
were overwhelmed.  But we had a kind of admi ration for them.
 
 
The difference was that since the Ashkenazi people 
were more religious, they
 had lived mainly in 
Jewish circles.  And they were comi ng either fr
om Poland or Russia or other countries, and they 
had been living more in isolation, so they were in
 a closer society and th
ey were used to being 
among all Jewish people.  The difference with 
the Sephardic Jews was that we were more 
integrated into the rest of th
e culture and population and various 
religions.  So yes, they were 
Jewish and they were doing the traditional Jewish
 observance.  But we were not as close to the 
religion as were these people comi ng from s malle
r villages.  And also 
because those Jewish 
people were put into ghettos and we
re obliged to be isolated and 
interact only w
ith each other.
 
 

Q: So I™m not sure how you mi ght be able to an
swer this if you weren™t 
really seeing other me n 
prisoners, but I™m interested in the di fferences
 between how wome n and 
men were treatedin 
Auschwitz. I don™t know if you have any perspective?
 
A: The work that was given to me n was a lot ha
rder and more difficult.  They were going to 
mi nes and they would carry two great stones, so they
 had a much harder life in the camp and also, 
of the survivors that came out of our group, most
 are wome n.  There are maybe only five or six 
me n of the 150 that survived.
 
 
Q: I think that I saw, or I th
ink I remember in what you were
 saying before, some thing about 
contact you yourself had with SS or with 
kapos
 or, you know, other, and I was wondering if there 
is anything else you didn™t™ say about yourpersonal interactio
n with those people?
 
A: An extraordinary thing happened to me  when 
I was in Landsberg, Germany.  I wa s working at 
the time  in the washing rooms.  There were four wome n in the washing rooms and we were 
washing blankets from dead people or sick people
 and all the dirty clothe
s t hat  were fro m t he 
people who had died, also from diseases, with li
ce and withŠ  We  were obliged to wash about 
60 blankets a day.   I was washing then.  And at 
some  point in time, there was an officer that 
came in with other SS and they had their handke
rchiefs on their nosesbecause the smell was 
unbearable in there.  They said, ﬁKeep washing 
and working.  We  are doing an inspection.ﬂ  And 
this officer, at some  point in time , looked at
 me  and asked in Fr ench, ﬁWhere are you comi ng 
from? ﬂ  So I said, ﬁI™m comi ng from Kos and th
en from Ausc hwitz,ﬂ because that™s where I was 
comi ng from at the time.  I was then in Lands
berg.  And the officer asked, ﬁWhere are your 
parents?ﬂ  And then I said, ﬁThey stayed in– they 
stayed in Auschwitz.ﬂ  And then after that he 
asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen.  No, 
he asked first, ﬁWhat were you doing before? ﬂ   And 
then I said, ﬁCertainly not that.ﬂ  Then he looked 
at me  and he said, ﬁI can
 see from your hands,ﬂ 
because I still had good hands at the time.  Then he
 asked if I wanted to work in the kitchen. The 
kitchen was the best place to work, because th
ere was food and it was warm.  So I said, ﬁOh, 
yes.ﬂ  Then he left.  And that evening he sent
 a prisoner, a guy from Vienna, who came over and 
gave me  a pack with sugar and salami and so
me  ma rgarine and bread and he said, ﬁDon™t say 
anything.  This is the officer se
nding you that.ﬂ  And for a fe w days
, every day he sent that with 
the prisoner and then at some  point in time, the 
kitchen chief (an older political prisoner interned 
in 1933) came  and said, ﬁYou come  here.  I received
 orders that you are to work in the kitchen.ﬂ  

And later on, I saw the officer. He was a doctor a
nd he was working at the hospital. I tried to 
smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and 
he kind of ma de a sign not to say a word about 

it.  And so I worked in the kitchen with my 
cousins Sara and Notrika and with another lady 
name d Estela Levy.  
 
 
The kitchen was of course the best  place to be, bu
t also, a few days after I left the laundry to 
begin working in the ki tchen, they closed th
e washing rooms because all the wome n working 
there di ed. So me became  crazy and the others got typhoid.  They all di ed.  So I was really lucky 

to have survived because  I was saved by this officer, which is for me  an amazing story. And that 
was the only contact I had directly.
 
 
At some  poi nt in time , they closed the kitc
hen because there were more and more bombings 
around the camps, because it was get
ting to the end of the war.  Th
e Nazis were getting more and 
more scared, and there was hardly anything to 
eat because they couldn™t ge t any food for the 
camps.  And they were gi ving us a piece of bread for 18 people and the bread was usua lly half-

molded because it was so old.  And so one day they
 asked us to go out of the camp and to go pick 
up some  pot atoes in the fields because – Ther
e was no more food.  It was raining steadily.
 
 
Q: When did you leave Auschwitz for Landsbergand how did that come  about, going from one 

to the ot her?
 
A: At some point in time, they called us from 
the camp where we were and we had to go out and 
we had to be in line without clot
hes.  And we had to pass in fr
ont of a me dical team. Among them 
was Mengele.  So we were very scared because
 there was another selection happening there.  

And a woma n that was in front of me , one girl th
at I knew, who had been burned when she was a 
little kid by oil in the kitchen and she had a sc
ar around the neck. She was a beautiful woma n, but 
she had just that one thing.  And they didn™t 
know Œ the Germans Œ if it wa s an infection or 
some thing, so they put he r on the side  where the 
people were to be killed, because they thought it 
was a disease.  My cousins and I were still aroun
d the kitchen at the time and I had taken a beet 
and I had looked for them in the block, but in
 the bock there was nobody anymore.  I got very 
scared, so I ran and I saw them in line and I 
said, ﬁPut the beet on 
your cheek, so you will look 
good, because we are passing in front of the doctor.ﬂ 
 So that™s what they did, and actually it was 

good for them because they looked so healthy, suddenly.  After that, they threw us anot her pack 
of clothes, and with that we went to another 
train.  That day of selection wa s October 26, 1944, 
and from there we went into a train and we trav
eled for two days.  They most likely selected 
those who could still work in Ge
rmany.  We  arrived in Klaffering 
station and were divided into 
two groups: one to Bergen-Belsen an
d the other to Landsberg.    
 
 
At that point, they told us to
 pick up coats that had been thro
wn on the ground.  They told us to 
put the coats on and then start walking.  It was ni
ght, and it was cold, so we put the coats on and 
started walking for the whole night.  And while 
we were walking, we were kind of feeling like 
there was sand on us, but we kept on.  We  saw 
the country, you know, with lights and people far 
away.  We  saw the dogs and things and we kept
 on walking all night, and we still had this 
sensation that we didn™t understa
nd, something that felt like sand on 
us.  Then, when we arrived 
in Landsberg, all the lights were 
very bright in front of the cam
p.  And then we saw the officers. 
They were healthy, and in their uniforms, and clea
n, and they were in a line waiting for us.  They 
asked us to throw the coats on the floor, and when 
we took the coats off, we realized they were 
full of lice.  And our whole bodies were full of 
lice because ba sically what they wantedŠ They 
had no way to transport these coats with lice, so
 they had us carry them over to Landsberg.
 

 
 
Tape 3, Side A
 
Q: Could you give me  an idea about how it was that
 this group of prisoners you were part of was 
deported from Auschwitz to Landsberg?   Why 
do you think it was at
 a particular time ?
 
A: The camps were not too big, li
ke Landsberg, so what they did 
in Auschwitz, they just chose, 
did a selection and picked some  of the people to 
work in some of the camps, so some  went to 
Landsberg, others went to others
.  That™s why they did the sel
ection and took randomly, people to 
go in one or the other.  
 
The Germans wanted to get the people out ofthe camp because the Russians were advancing, and 
the Nazis didn™t want anyone to see what was going 
on.  And then the plan was just to blow the 
place up and blow up the crematorium and the gas chambers, but they didn™t have the time before 
the Russians arrived.
 
 
Q: We re conditions very bad at Landsberg?
 
A: For me  it was not difficult because  at the 
beginning I was in the washing room, so I had a 
double amount of the regular food that they were gi
ving to the others.  And after that, I was lucky 
to be in the kitchen.  But for the other ones, some
 of them that came with me, they were obliged 
to go, they cleaned the train station or
 went into the forest to cut wood.
 
 
Q: How ma ny prisoners 
were in this camp?
 
A: About 50 wome n Œ I don™t know the number for me n, but not ma ny.
 
 
Q: How long did you stay there, and what happened next?
 
A: I stayed there for almost six months.  I work
ed in the washing room, then the kitchen.  Then 

the Allied forces came  in from the West.
 
 
Q: What date were you liberated?  And when di
d you Œ so we don™t lose the dates Œ when did you 
leave Landsberg, go to Dachau and the next?
 
A:  We  were sent to pick up pot
atoes as it rained heavily, and that
 was when we said no for the 
first time .  The guards came back with a bucket full of excrement, and threw it at us, saying ﬁPig 

Jews.ﬂ  It wa s very cold, but we had to go out to 
wash ourselves off in the rain.  Two days later, 
there was an evacuation, a long ma
rch -- not a death ma rch, but a l
ong one: three days and three 
nights, sleeping at night on the 
ground in the forest.  Where were we going?  We  didn™t know.  
 
 

We arrived at Dachau.  It  was terr ible, filled with left over people fr om ma ny camps.  Was it the 
end of the world?   There was no food; we went 
the night without food.  Then a walk to Alach, 
and we were liberated from there.  There was inte
nse Allied bombing.  They  were very close and 

we were ordered to a bunker.  In the morning 
when we came out, no Germans were there.  What 
had happened?   Did they leave?   On the me n™
s side of the camp, there was no move me nt.  We  

walked through camp.  We entered in barracks that 
had been occupied by German guards.  There 
were beds, food, even a piano.  I played from th
e Butterfly Opera.  Then we heard trucks and 
thought:  they™ve come  back.  We  we re trembling but going out we saw Jeeps.  The soldiers were 

not speaking German, and they said ﬁHello.ﬂ  Th
ey were Americans finding camps and liberating 
them.  Everybody was hugging.  The soldiers gave us
 things: food, chocolate, etc.  We  stayed 
there about one month be
fore evacuating the camp.
 
 
Q: What date were you liberated?
 
A: 30 April 1944.  Out of Landsberg, we were gr
ouped by nationalities.  It was April but ma ybe 
not that exact date.  We  received double food.  In trucks we we nt to Muni ch, then to Bolzano, 

where we stayed one night in the hospital, then
 toward the south to Modena where the great 
Military Academy was located.  Th
e building had been destroyed.  
 
 
Q: I wanted to find out, right af
ter the war, when you started goi
ng to Italy, how was your health 
and were you in this hospital because you were not well?   And when did you get well?   Or can 

you clarify what you were doing?
 
A: My health status?  No, these were refugee 
camps.  We  were not sick, just mi serable and 
skinny.  The Americans found Nazi wome n™s uniform
s and we wore them.  The refugee camps in 
Modena were full.  Trucks were sent for diffe
rent areas.  Finally, a woman from the Red Cross 

asked:  Why are you here?   We  wanted to know how to get to Rhodes.  She told a driver to take 

us six girls to Bologna.  When we arrived only 
the concierge was there, 
who was surprised to see 
six girls in German uniforms.  The building was fu
ll of furniture left there by Jews when they got 
away.  The community president came and told us 
that the Palestinian brigade was there.  They 

brought water and food.  But some thing incredible
 happened Œ they me ntioned that they had a 
ﬁFrancoﬂ among them.  It was my brother, Nissim.
  He was at the Austrian border and this was 

some thing beyond belief.  He came t o Bologna a
nd he stayed one week.  He brought me  many 
things.  I stayed about a month, and had a good ti
me .  I was invited by the Jewish community  Œ 
Mrs. Weiss from the joint told me that I should 
go to Florence, and she found a person for me .  It 
was not easy to go through Italy w
ithout being able to go to Rhodes.
 
 
We six girls found there a girl of
 14, who had lost all her fami ly, and we took her under our care.  
Her name  was Alice St arika.  I had no contact wi
th Africa then, but my fa
mily sent some money.  
In Modena, we had an interesting event.  To get 
soup, we had to first get a 
number in the hall, and 
since we appeared in German unifor ms, we
 were asked, ﬁWho are you? ﬂ  And when we 

explained, their response was ﬁHow can I be sure 
what you™re saying is true?ﬂ  So we showed the 
tattooed number.  We  ate well 
and went upstairs to sleep.
 
 
In Florence, we got help from 
the UN to pay for the pension a
nd food.  We had two rooms for six 
wome n: three per room for a year.  The Israelis 
gave us uniforms.  Some of the girls ended up 
going to America.  I wanted to go to Kos and 
see what was left, whic
h ended up being nothing.
 
 
Q: Am I understanding that you returned at that time to Kos?
 
A:  Yes, I returned to Kos and when I went bac
k, the Mother Superior of the school where I used 
to go, she found out and said she was very sad for 
all that had happened.  And she said there is 
only one place I should be.  She said
, ﬁStay with us,ﬂ so I stayed 
at the convent for three months 
and was taken care of by the nuns for that time.
 
 
Q: How long were you in the different places you lived in Italy and when do you think you ma de 
your trip back to Kos?
 
A: I stayed for one month in Bologna and for a year
 in Fl orence.  When I was in Florence at some  
point in time, I went to Kos, and I stayed in 
Kos for three months to try to see if ther e was 
some thing that was still there– my family.  Bu
t nothing was there and then in the Tr eaty of 
Yalta, the island that ha d belonged to Italy went
 to Greece.  The nuns who were on the island of 

Kos had to leave, so the Italian 
governme nt sent a boat to pick up a
ll the Italians that were still on 
the island, and I embarked on the same  boat and we le
ft.  We went to Rome , so I stayed in Rome  
with the nuns and then after that 
I went back to Florence.  And then from Florence, I got in touch 
with the man I eventually married, who was an Ita
lian offi cer in the Italian army whom I had met 
in Kos ma ny years before and we were– we kne
w each other.  He was deported as a military 
prisoner to Auschwitz, so he had 
different treatment.  I had gotten in touch with his fa mily and 
asked if they had news about him and found out he 
was there.  He was very surprised I was alive 
and came out of the camp.  And then we got ma rried and went to Africa.
 
 
Q: Did you already specify– how did you decide to 
go to the particular place in Africa that you 
went first?
 
A: My husband™s brot her, who was vacationing in It
aly, told us to come  to Brazzaville, where we 
stayed for four years.  Then we went to Leopol
dville.  We  stayed in Africa for 27 years.  In 1974 
we went to Brussels.
 
 
Q: We re you involved in a Jewish community while you were living in Africa?
 
A: Yes, there were ma ny Jews from Rhodes there.
 

 
Q: So there were several other indivi
duals from Rhodes in this community?
 
A: Yes, ma ny.  Mainly Se phardic.  They went there before the war.
 
 
Q: How ma ny other survivors of the Holocau
st Œ of the war Œ were there with you?
 
A: About 50.  Most of the people who survived fromthis community went to Zaire.  Only a few, 
ma ybe one or two of them went to America, like 
Mrs. Dell, a lady that  is
 in New York now and 
her sister, who is in California.  But all the ot
hers went to the (then) Belgian Congo and then 
Zaire and then Congo now.
 
 
Q: Why did you move fr om one place to
 the other while you were in Africa?
 
A: Because of my husband™s business.  The compa
ny he was working with closed down and then 
after four years in Brazzaville, a cousin that
 was in Leopoldville called 
us to say, ﬁWhy don™t you 
come  here and work with me ? ﬂ   And then we went to Leopoldville to work.
 
 
Q: I want to ma ke sure I get the dates right. 
 I have that it™s May 1947 to September 1951 in 
Brazzaville, is that correct?
 
A: Yes, yes, yes.
 
 
Q: And then September 1951 to July 1974 in Leopoldville?
 
A: Yes.
 
 
Q: And then how did you decide to move to Belgium?
 
A: In 1960, some  people that were working in th
e Belgian Congo went.  They used to send their 
children to school in Belgium.  1960 was the inde
pendence.  These people had some  links with 
Belgium because they we re doing business with Be
lgium, since it was a Belgian colony.  They 
had some  offices there.  So in 1960, most of th
e people that worked th
ere, of this Jewish 
community and others, sent their families to Belg
ium, and that™s why some  of them sta yed there 
and never left after that.  I 
only went to Brazzaville during that time Œ the independence Œ but 
later we came back to Leopoldville and we stay
ed until 1974.  We  left in 1974 because  of the 
nationalization by President 
Mobutu.  We  decided to 
leave and we went to France first, where my 
husband™s brother was living, and then from there we
 went to Brussels because we had a lot of 
friends from the town in Africa.  That™s why we went there.
 
 
 

Tape 3, Side B
 
Q: I wanted to ask, because we me nt ioned th
is while not recording, 
a little bit about the 
community in Belgium and if there ar e survi
vors there who had a sim
ilar journey to yours?
 
A: Yes, most of them started the same  way and 
they all went  to Auschwitz and after that some 
went to certain camps and others to others, bu
t the beginning part of the story is the same .
 
 
Q: We  have referred a few times during the inte
rview to a book that you have written, and would 
you tell me  when it is you decided to write down your experiences?
 
A: I had started the book when I went to Brazzav
ille at the beginning and 
then I continued it in 
Leopoldville and when I saw that I wa s telling some
 of the story and some people were hardly 
even listening, or believing in it,
 I decided I would continue writi
ng because I would 
at least have 
it in written for mat.  And also when I had a daug
hter, I decided I would c
ontinue and write a bit 
for her, so it would rema in for the next generation.  Then, I left the book 
there, half-finished.  
And a year later, when I went to
 Brussels, I realized that some  
of the people in Europe were kind 
of talking about the concentration camps and th
e gas chambers– Some  politicians in France 
were talking about it like a mi nor detail of histor
y Œ as if it was not that important.  And then 
some  profes sors were even saying 
things like that in university in
 France, so I got very revolted 
about that.  And I decided some body, like ma ny othe
rs, should put it down on paper.  When the 
comme mora tion of the liberation of the 50 year
s of the deportation came , it was 1994.  In 1994, I 
said I would also finish my book Š as a me mory 
Š to all the people that 
I knew that had died.  
So I finished the book at that time and I adde
d the beginning of the book 
about the comments of 
some  people in Europe, about the gas chamber, et cetera.
 
 
Q: I was wondering if you would be willing to, no
t only give the title 
of the book, but would you 
be interest ed in just read
ing a short portion from it?
 
A: The title is 
Un Jour la Joie de Vivre S™arrêtat a Uschwitz.
  
(One Day the Joy of Life Stopped 
at Auschwitz).  
Wr itten in me moriam of martyrs from R
hodes and Kos.  [She reads a pa ragraph]
 
 
Q: Are you aware of any other survivors who have written about their experiences, who are from 
Rhodes or from Kos?
 
A: Yes, a friend, Elisa Franco.  A good book.
 
 
Q: What do you think is the long term
 i mpact for you, of the Holocaust?
 
A: It must serve to refl ect specifically for the 
future generations, so it do
es not happen again.  The 
title of my book came fr om a book by C. Levi.
 
 

Q: I know that you did wr ite about your experien
ces all the way back when you were living in 
Africa and I™m just wondering, did you speak to 
other people about your experiences and when 
did you start telling your daught
er about your experiences?
 
A: I had started the book and then 
I arrived in Africa, and I starte
d telling the story sometimes.  I 
was being asked about it, so I was telling some  of
 the story but I realized
 that although most of 
the people were listening, they were not really
 always believing it.  If they weren™t believing, 
were they really interested?   
Because they were living in a su
rrounding that was very comfortable 
and very easy and a lot of them had not seen th
at, so I felt a bit sad about this. But I continued 
writing my book for my self and then when my daught
er grew a little older, then I read to my 
daughter some  of the pieces I ha d written.  And 
that™s why later on, my daughter asked me  to 
finish the book I had started, since I reme mbered
 the book had already been written and there was 
not that muc h more to continue.
 
 
Q: Can you give me  the name  of your daughter?
 
A: My daughter, she™s Marina Garzolini.
 
 
Q: And I believe you have onl
y one child, is that right?
 
A: Yes, I have one child.
 
 
Q: I™ve got two more questions.  One is, what 
do you reme mber as your time  of greatest fear 
during all of the Holocaust and war time?
 
A: When there were selections
 in camp.  Life or Death?
 
 
Q: And how important has religion b
een for you since the war has ended?
 
A: The religion.  I was born with a religion and 
I grew up with a religion.  When I came  out of 
the camps, I wondered if– if God rea
lly existed.  But then with time,
 I just healed my feelings a 
little bit.  But to this day, I still wonder why 
have the people of Israel 
and why have the Jewish 
people been so persecuted?   And 
why have they been so punished 
during their life?   Even today I 
pose this question.
 
 
Q: Is there anything else you would like to
 add before we conclude this interview?
 
A: I thank you very muc h for interviewing me .  A
nd also, what I said today came fr om my soul.  
And I when people read my book, the new generation, 
I want them to reali
ze that something like 
that should not happen again.
 
 

Q: Thank you.  Thank you.
 
A: Thank you.
