Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
 interview wit h 
Mr. 

, 
on May 7
th
, 2013 at the 
Kosciuszko Foundation 
in 
New 
York City
, and I woul d like to thank you, Mr. 

, for co
mi ng to speak 
with us toda y. And I™d like to start  the interview, like we alwa ys do, at the 
beginning. I™d like you to tell us a little bit  about yourself, starting with the date you 

were born, t he place you were born, and please pronounce your full name for us. 

And I™ll Œ then we™ll go from there. 

Answer: All right. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: My name is pronounced 
Jerzy G
 
, that™s in Polish. In English, 

, to make it easier. And I was born in November 19, 1922, so I am 
over 90 now. And probably what we discussed with you i s that I™m one of the last 

living witnesses, not to the Holocaust, but to t he times of the Holocaust, as 

witnessed b
y many of us who had to escape, o
ccupation of 
Poland
 was by the 
Germans and the Soviets Œ Soviet s. And we found ourselves in different parts of the 

world. 
Q: Well, let  me interrupt for a second. That™s a wonderful introduction, and we will 
go back even further, because we will get to that central part of the experience and 

the reality of what t he t wo different forces were, and how they pla yed themselves

out in 
Pol and
. But let™s start far more individually. Tell me a little bit about your 
family, your father™s name, your mother™s name, their occupations.  
A: Well, m y father™s name was 
K azimierz 
 
, or 
Casi mi r 
in Œ in 
English. And he was from an old family who was probably a landed gentry 

someti me i n the 18
th
 century, our area. And they found themselves al so refugees in 
Œ in the 1770s, to 
Warsaw
, when the part of the country in which they li ved, which 
is 
Pomerania
 on t he 
Baltic
 shore, was taken over by the Prussians. And that was 

the beginning of the bi g, tragic Polish hi story, was through stupi dity of the rulers 

and of the ruling classes, the y run into the situation where the 
Poland
 was divided. 
It was once a very Œ 

Q: Large. 

A: Œ 
flourishing Polish
-Lithuanian kingdom, very large, enormous amounts of 
territory, from the 
Baltic 
to the 
Black 
Sea almost, which was a magnet for many 
foreigners who were written down as refugees or i mmigrants. Because 
Poland
 had 
a unique in Œ in the European history, syst em of elected kings, and Œ and the 

parliament. 

Q: For the Middle Ages, un
heard of.
 

A: Unheard of. Unheard of even during the lat er ages. So 
Poland
 was an open 
country. I alwa ys compare it to 
America
, although 300 years later, but it was a

country of immigrants. We had many, many nationalities, and foreigners as far from 
Sweden
,
 Scotland
, 
Spain
, tracking down, looking for freedom of location to live, 
education, religion, and Œ and speech. It was Œ but that also requires some kind of 

rules. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And the y Œ the Œ they were so e-e-enchant ed with the freedom that the y forgot 
that there are rules al so, the y have t o contri but e something to thi-this country. So 

they did not pa y taxes, for instance, the y di d not care about  the arm y. So the Polish-

Lithuanian army was mini mal, i n Œ compared to the nei ghboring countries like Œ 

Q: You™re talking about the 18
th
 century. 
A: Eighteen Œ na Œ
 Russia
. But this is why so many peopl e were displaced during 

the Œ and my family was one of those, on m y father™s side. On my m other™s side, 
entirely different story. My grand-grandfather was a Napoleonic officer Œ 
Q: Oh m y. 

A: Œ who went to 
Moscow
 with the Polish-Lit huanian army, to occupy 
Moscow
. 
And the y did, but then they were defeated by frost, and again quarrels among them. 

So the y retreated. My Œ 
m y great
-gran Œ grandfather was wounded on the present 

Belarusian 
border, and was saved by some people who lived in a Œ in a landed 

manor. Landed gent ry in mano Œ 
manner. And returnedto 
France 
when 
Napoleon

was gone already. And he was so di-disenchanted with the re Œ resurgence of the 
royal family in 
Fra
nce
, that he returned back t o 
Poland
 where he met  all the other 
people who were also some kind of revolutionaries, too. 

Q: The y were sort of like 19
th
 century revolutionaries. 
A: Yes, yes Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ well, 
Napoleon
 arose Œ 
Q: We 
Œ 1858
, yes.
 
A: Œ from the revolution. 

Q: Right. 

A: French revoluti on. 

Q: Right. 
A: So there was thi s spirit of Œ of revolution. And he brought hi s two out of his 
three Œ his five children, he brought two sons to 
Poland
. And one of my gra Œ 
m y 
mother™s father is Œ is t he Œ is Œ  

Q: Son. 

A: Œ is the son of that Œ is Œ yes, of one of these Frenchmen. 

Q: Well you know what Œ one thi ng that strikes me right away, is that you can trace 

back your family to Œ across two or three centuries. Not many people can. 

 
Interview with Jerzy 

  
 
May 8, 2013

A: Yeah. 
Q: The y know that  there™s thi Œ so this must have been mo Œ something that you 

learned about at home, you know, that your parents told you, that  was in the air, t hat 

Œ you know, how did you fi Œ how did it become known? 

A: F-First of all, I collected all this material s from the family, and members who 
were alive after the war. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And saved this in form of loose leafs, handwritten stories. And then I collected a 

lot of photographs. I have at home many al bums, which I redone, sa Œ taking back 

the history of m y famil y t o 1840s. Why? Because our 
[indecipherabl e]
 story 
unusual. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: In 
Warsaw
, our house and our apartment survived the uprisi ng and the war. 
Q: No kidding? 
A: Oh yes. So that ™s why I return after the war. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because m y family was survived, and 
m y mother, my
 Œ and Œ and th Œ the home 
is here, our business, which was a big lithography, painti ng Œ 

Q: Well, this I wanted to ask about you. 

 
Interview with Jerzy 

  
 
May 8, 2013

A: Yes?  
Q: I Œ I wanted to Œ to l earn more about how your family supported it self, whether 

or not both of your parents worked, and Œ and tell us a lit tle bit about  that.  

A: We 
Œ we had a Œ we Œ m y parents met soon after Œ I think right  in ™21, soon after 
the big celebration after the Œ the victory of the Œ the 
Bol shevik
 war.  
Q: Oka y. Against the 
B olsheviks
.  
A: Against the 
Bolsheviks
, yes. And myfather 
Œ I have 
a 
Œ photographs of him i n 
the uniform, on a horse, but Œ but I think he was released quickly, because he 

inherited from my grandfather, a big lithography and Œ and painting works, one of 

the biggest in 
Warsaw
, who specializes in pai nting, scientific albums Œ 
Q: What was it called, t he company? 

A:Artistic lithography of 

(ph) 

. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: My grandfather. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Was born in 1843, and I suspect that he was fighting in this 60 Œ i n 1860s in this 

Œ one of these craz y i nsurrections, where the Polish-Lithuanian 
area a 
Œ gentry 

actually arose against the tsarist, you know, with pistols and sabers against the 

Russian arm y. And so t hat was one of these tragic events i n the hi story. Because 

 
Interview with Jerzy

there is a big gap in his history, which I suspect that is Œ not to menti on anywhere, 
because 
it for Œ afraidi ng Œ yeah, the y were afraid of talking about this, after the 
[indecipherable]
 in ™69, or somet hing li ke that. 

Q: Yes. 

A: But I saw his photographs in some ki nd of a patriotic, you know, uniforms and 
thing. So Œ so that™s Œ t hat™s Œ that™s this part of the story, but Œ so my father 
actually inh Œ inheri ted all this busine
ss, very 
Œ one of the most well-noted painting 

works, and, after the World War I, and 
he met m y French mother,becauseall 

[indecipherable]
 were French citizens from Napoleonic times. 
Q: Oh, wow. 

A: But all the women who married lo Œ l ost t heir French citizenship. So men 

mai ntained this. So, I have this French connection, which was our life, until 
recently. 
Q: Did you have siblings? 

A: What?
 
Q: Do you have si blings? 

A: I have one daughter, yes, here Œ here in 
New York
. 
Q: Excuse me, but do you Œ did you have brot hers and sisters? 

A: Oh, no, no, I™m Œ si bling, I™m sorry. Yes, I had one brother, but he died.

Q: Is he ol der or younger than you? 
A: Younger, three years of Œ 
yeah.
 
Q: Oka y, so he was born in 1925. 

A: Yes.  

Q: You were the oldest son.  
A: Yes. 
Q: The oldest child. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: How would you describe your childhood? Is that too ba Œ large a question? How 

would you describe your childhood? 

A: Childhood? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Well, there were two phases. One was extreme pleasant ness, and ease, and well-
being, after the World War I, because of m y father™s abili ty to run this business 

expanded. But unfortunately, he was killed in a car accident  on Sept ember 1
st
, 1929, 
10 years before the war was Œ 
the second war.
 
Q: But you were just a boy? 

A: I was a boy, seven years old, and of course, I barely survived t his crash. 

Q: You were in the car? 

 
Interview with Jerzy 

  
 
May 8, 2013

A: Yes, I w as in the car. And so, hard ti mes arrived soon after, because next month 
after this accident, the 
Wall 
Street went bust in 
New York
. And since my father 
had many, many business connecti ons and plans and Œ and 
ec 
Œ of expansion, that 

loans, bank  
loans, prop
ert y bought on credit and all that, collapsed with the Œ with 
the crash in 
New York
; worldwide, grand dep-depression descended. And here i s 
really 
a 
Œ a very interesting, to me at least, the story of m y mother Œ 

Q: Yes. 

A: Œ 
who didnot have any special ed
ucation. In fact, the World War I prevented her 

from finishing her high school even, because as a French family, t he y were 

evacuated from Œ 
from 
Poland 
to 
Moscow
. 
Q: To 
Moscow
?  
A: Yes, because they were French, and the Germans were coming and occupying 
the Russian held territories in 1915. 
Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Until the y Œ the y stopped confronting t he Russian arm y, and what the y decided 

that, let™s not fight any more, let™s make a revolution everywhere. 
But th
-the French 
citizens who were evacuated to 
Moscow
 stayed there until ™16 Œ 1916 - ™17, but 
then the revolution erupted in 
Russia
, and they were again evacuated through the

[indecipherable]
 the northern sea, to 
France
. And they came back to 
Poland
 i n 
1919. That™s where my father met my mot her.  
Q: Wow, it was fascinating even up til that ti me. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So, your mother is Œ is faced with a very heartbreaking task in 1929. 
A: Yes, she Œ she was a very beautiful young woman, surrounded always by elegant 
men. And they returned to 
Warsaw
 in 1919-
20,and met m
y father and began a 
very happy life. And so I was born in Œ under that period, but, you know, few years 

later, it Œ the 
tragedy st ruck,and m y mother,agai
nst wi-wi Œ advice of everybody; 

family and friends, and acquaintances well placed here and there, decided that she 

will run the business herself. So she began to work alone as a worker in her own 

establishment. From all the stages of production, you know, from the l owest 
[indecipherable]
 and afternoon she was si tting on Œ behind m y father™s desk, with 
the accountant and busi ness manager, and was learning how to run a business. 

Q: Amazing. 

A: Amazing. 

Q: Amazing.

A: And I have all t hat documented in the photographs, what m y father was taking, 
which m y mother was taking, and beginni ng in 1973, which I was taki ng. All these 

albums survived t he war, and are here Œ 

Q: Wow.
 

A: Œ on 
66
th
 Street. 
Q: What happened t hen? 

A: Well, she pulled out  an Œ an amazing feat of courage and Œ and goodwill from 

people around, she saved the business, and act ually establ ished a very prosperous 

life, and married for the second time in ™37, when she Œ when she was sure that 

everything was goi ng to work wel l. And Œ  

Q: What was the name of her second husband? 

A: 
[indeci pherable]
 
Zho ntko ski
(ph).  
Q: 
Zho ntko ski

A: 
Zho ntko ski
(ph), ye
s. And thi s is the man who became my, sort of model of how 
to behave, how to Œ 

Q: You were close t o him? 

A: Hm?  

Q: Were you close t o him? 

 
Interview with Jerzy 

  
 
May 8, 2013 
 
 
 
14
 
A: Yes, very. Although, not really physical ly, but emotionally, yes. B ecause I was 
lacking this paternal  connection for Œ for seven, eight years. 

Q: And th- these are crucial years in the development of a child. 

A: And he came, and I was Œ I was a troubled boy, yeah, I was Œ I was not doing 

well at school, I was ki nd of a little hooligan, I must say. And so, when 
he marrie
d 
in 30 s Œ ™37, in ™38, they Œ me and my brother were kicked out of the house, we 
went to a Jesuit boarding school, which was Œ 

Q: Willthe y bring 
Œ 
did you 
Œ  
A: Œ beautifully Œ you know, f Œ 

Q: Did they bring you i nto order?  

A: Yes. Was all Œ although the y did not molest  me, no. But the y did bring me Œ and 

that was, I Œ I visit ed the place in 2010, it™s outside 
Lwów
 Œ 
Lviv
.  
Q: What ki nd of Œ 
yeah, 
what kind of memories do you have of the ti me that you 
were there at that Jesuit  boarding school? 

A: I must sa y, I have al l the best memories, yes, yes. Because I Œ I needed this Œ this 

ruse Œ 

Q: Discipli ne. 

A: Œ you know, y- yes. I needed Œ I didn™t realize. Now, I can say yes. 
Q: Yeah.

A: It was a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ al most a miraculous decision to sa Œ to save me, you know, 
because I Œ I got straightened out. And it was just when t he war broke out, when we 
were Œ were on vacati on after that first year wi th the Jesuits. 

Q: So the war broke out after your first year of boarding school? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Tell me, how di d the war Œ how did you learn about the war happening? That is, 
when it happened, t he day that it happened, where were you?  

A: Well, pri or to that moment, we were well instructed by our history teacher, who 

sported a bi g scar on hi s cheek, like that. And the rumor was that he was serving in 

the cavalry i n ni Œ i n Œ during the 
Bolshevik 
war. And he took part in a Œ last 
probably in the history of mankind, cavalry charge between the Polish cavalry and 

the 
Marshal 
Budyo nny
 cavalry of Œ 
Q: Of the Russians. 

A: Œ of Russians. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Who were moving from the south, from the 
Ukraine
. 

Q: Well, cert ainly for the 20
th
 century.

Interview with Jerzy

A: The last Œ last caval ry, yes, charge. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I think Œ I think several thousands Œ thousands of cavalry was involved on both 

sides. So Œ so he was very much aware of the dangers of the war, and he, during his 

history classes was explaining to us what the present situat ion and Œ and Œ 
ma y 
bring. And one da y in April ™39, we were gat hered in the auditori um where we used 

to have a theater productions and so forth, there was a lo Œ radio and the 

loudspeakers connected, and we heard the announcement  of the foreign minist er 

from the Polish parliament, the same refusal of accept 
Hitler™s 
reque
st to give in to 
the Œ to German reg Œ demand of some Œ some territorial Œ and we were, of course, 

cheering in support , but this teacher told us, boys, you don™t know what is going to 

happen, but  everything is not going well. So you can cheer, and Œ 
so w
-w
e 
Œ 
we had 
the sense that somebody warned us, of course not Œ so we Œ the vacati on came later, 
in Œ on June or July, and we had the great ti me during vacation. And Œ and then 

suddenly we were called back from the vacation on the Œ on the 
Baltic
, on the 
beaches, we were there, by Œ by somebody send a car with a driver, return 

immediately and so forth. And Œ and as we were driving back, somebody bought a 

newspaper and there it was, and I t hi Œ thi s is Œ this is the date I know, it was 

August 23
rd
, ™39, where there was a big news that the 
Hitler 
made a pact with t he

Soviet Union
 that there will be no war bet ween them. And that was the Œ the 
invitation for the Œ 
Germany
 to invade. There will be no intervention of the 
Soviets. 

Q: Now, did that Œ did people understand t hat instinctively? When they saw the 

news Œ [
technical interruption, break] 
We 
Œ we were at Œ you find out Œ 
ah
-ha, 
m y question was, you read in the newspaper about the agreement between 
Hitler
 

and 
Stalin
, and did people instinct ively then realize that thi s is bad for 
Poland
?  
A: I Œ I don™t remember how people Œ because we were ki Œ you know, I was 17 
and a half, and there were two girls with me, and we were driving to Œ 

Q: The y™re much more interesting, of course.  

A: The y™re much, much inter Œ 
but, y
ou know, fi Œ wha Œ it was 10 days later Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ or a week later, 23
rd
? Yeah, eight da ys l ater, we were woken up at five o™clock 
in the morning by the air Œ 
airraid sirens. And 
Œ and then, of course, I Œ we run on 
the balcony, and there were plane

Œ  
Q: Was thi s in 
Warsaw

and I saw one plane being downed. And t hen of course, we run to t he Œ to the radi o, 

and there was this announcement t hat th-the war has started, and t he president had a 

statement, and m y brother said no, it™s fine. We are not going to school. So that was 

Œ that was t he reacti on.  
Q: Yeah. And did you go back to school? 
A: No, no.  

Q: So you had only one year at that  Jesuit school Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ but it did what it needed to do. 

A: 
The ydi d, yes, yes, yes.
 
Q: Oka y. So what happened Œ 
A: And of course, all the Œ all the Œ all the drama that developed the next few da ys, 
you know, the decl aration of war by 
Engl and
, and 
France
, and everybody was 
looking at the plane, where are the French pl anes coming, where are the English 

planes? Where Œ where is the aid, where is this, and so forth, how many da ys can 

we do it alone? You know, this type of thing. 

Q: Oka y.

A: So i-it was a moment full of expectation and hope. In the face of absolutely 
deteriorating physical situation around, people fleeing, you know, and roads full of 

refugees, and so forth. 

Q: What happened with your own family?  How did things devel op within your 

fa

A: Well, there was a Œ there was a Œ 
a 
Œ an unfortunate, or fortunate, I don™t know, 

uphill on the radio, some kind of a military person, pronounced t hat in order to 

formulate new unit s of the arm y, all men able t o bear arms should move east. 

Q: Right. 

A: Somewhere between 
Wilno
 and 
Lwów
, on that border, since Sovi ets are not 
going to interfere, and the new units will be formed there. And we need more 

volunteers and so forth. So, we parked Œ unfortun Œ fortunately we had our cars, and 
we parked t his Œ and some friends, you know, and cavalcade of mot orcars, full of 
men. We left 
Warsaw

The people who have cars, all the taxi Œ taxi should help to bring 

dead people from the street, col Œ you know, this type of horror stories. We had no, 

absolutely no contact with the family. And then Œ then the Germans came very 
close, and t he y actually surrounded 
Lwów
, so the gentleman in charge of our group 
decided we have to move out quickly, because tomorrow the Germ
an will
 encircle 
the Œ the city, and it wi ll be it. So we left at three o™clock in the morni ng Œ 

Q: Well, how were t he 
Schiffmans

nervous. 

A: Oh, we Œ we asked 
Schiffman

Q: At Œ at this 

, at the place Œ 
A: Oh yeah, well, we stopped on t he markets square, which was actually empty. I 

don™t know, maybe refugees were going the other way. Yes, because we diverted 

from the main track where everybody was moving. We di verted to another place, 

we had somebody t o leave over there on the road, one of my uncles. And we were 

look around, and t hen came a little Jewish boy with the Œ with the Œ with Œ 

Q: Payos. 

A: Œ side curls, yes, and Œ and had the whi te apron, and Œ  and Œ and he said, 
gentlemen, can I Œ 
you need 
Œ you need some help. Please step in, we have food, we 
can wash and so forth. So we went to thi s corner, kind of a wine cellar, under the 
arcades of very beautiful, gorgeous, historic ci t y square. And I remember the Œ t he 

name was called 
Fe

welcome, si t down. And he gave us Œ went to wash, and you know, and Œ and 
somehow, after all night of driving, and there was a discussion, i t™s i n the book, 

about m y stepfather and Œ and him, he was inquiring, what Œ what does Œ 
what is 

happening, what is happening? I don™t Œ we don™t have any paper, no papers, 

nothing, no radio. Well , we think t hat we were escaping because the Germans are 
behind us, you know. And Œ and Œ and then, when we were leaving, after you know, 
refreshment s and food, he didn™t want to accept any mone y. He brought a bottle of 

Tawki
(ph) which is an old, old musty, you know, dry Œ de Œ an ancient bottle. He 

says, this i s the oldest bottle I have in my wi-wi Œ 
cellar. Will you be kindenoughto
 

drink with me this, you know? So we drank, too. And he says, remember me 

always. And he didn™t want to leave. He said, look, this is ordained 
by t heGod, and 

I cannot change what  has been ordained, so to sta y, to go, it doesn™t matter. It is

A: I am fully aware of that, and I made the drawing the next day of that Œ of that 

restaurant, on that corner, yes. 

Q: And did he tell you his name? 
A: 
Festendik

Q: Oh, that was his name. 

A: Yeah.

Lwów
 Œ 
A: Yes.

because the Germ ans

no, no, it Œ  too Œ t oo far away, we™re Œ we™re t oo different dist Œ a great distance t o 

Œ to go back around the eastern border, and so on. So Œ so we went there. And Œ  

Q: Did you meet any o Œ did you meet up with any armies at all, any soldiers at all? 
A: Well, th-this is the situation, that at one poi nt we Œ w-we Œ we stayed in a Œ in Œ 
in a little manor house, or farm of some Germans, who were there for generations, 

living in Œ  close to the Slovak border already, or Romanian border. And 

[indecipherable]
 and Œ  and then we Œ we Œ we repaired old cars, and t hings like 
that. I was making drawings of all these activities, and Œ and then Mr. 
Byger
(ph) 

said don™t worry, d-don™t worry. Here I am German, if the Germans come, I will tell 

them that you are m y fami ly, so nobody will happen to you, nothing will Œ 

everything will be all right. You know, the Œ al so the naiveté of t Œ of th Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ of being Œ I tell them that you are m y family, no Œ no problem. And we were 

sort of waiting couple days, decidi ng what to do, then suddenly two policemen 

came on the bicycle, you know, they came and the y started talk to the driver of one 

of the cars, we were two cars, and the other family had a s Œ a chauffeur. So it was a 

kind of a luxury escape.

A: Yes, and the Œ and t he Œ and the y talk and t hey talked, and then they left. So the 
Œ the Œ the chauffeur came running, said, the y want to Œ they came to req Œ 

requisition the cars. So di Œ so why did t he y go ba Œ I told them I need something on 

paper 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So this was the Russians who came? 
A: No, the Polish a Œ 
Q: Ah.

Q: Right. 

A: Œ you have to bring me something on Œ 
on paper 
Œ  
Q: Paper. 
A: Œ with a stamp. So t hey Œ 
they wenton the bic yclesto 
Œ to bri ng t his paper, and 
we packed and left, and that was t he only thing to do.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: And as we arrived o-on a Œ on a boat there, we were joi Œ we joined actually a Œ 
a big column of the

Œ air force mai ntenance crews in trucks. And among 
this passengers there in the trucks were pil ots, who were telling that t hey lost all the 

planes already. They were fighting as long as t hey could, but no new planes arrived,

so wi Œ they were t old to evacuate to 
Romania
, because the French are fl ying the 
planes to 
Romania
. Again, naiveté. So the y lost all the Œ that Œ but these pilots were 
with us, finally we™ve crossed the border when somebody came on a motorc ycle 
dressed half in the uniform, half in civilian. And he said, the 
Bol sheviks
 are over 

there, 10 kil ometers from here. I escaped. The 
Bolsheviks
? So, then t he commot ion, 
and the Romanians opened the border, and we crossed. 

Q: So, unt il that point, the y wouldn™t have done it?  

A: Hm?  

Q: Until that point , they would not have Œ 

A: I wa Œ no, because t hey™re the bo Œ this was like s Œ a small border crossing, not 

used by

Q: Oka y. 
A: So the y didn™t know what to do, and the y were waiting for the telephone Œ 
Q: Instructi ons. 

A: Œ yeah, yeah. And so we were standing in front of that barrier, and the whole 

column, couple hundred trucks, full of equipment, mechanics, and pil ots. And t his

Q: And it was Œ 

A: While the French only had 300? I said, ask the French. 
Q: And the y Œ it was because they were able to cross the border at  that time? 
A: Because Œ because this was the only Œ the onl y segment of the Poli sh armed

with experience in fights during t hat two weeks of war, three weeks. And the y were 

immediately formed int o squadrons in

. The 

Romanians closed their eyes, looked the ot her way, and they all went by train,

look Œ walk, and ask for someplace to stay. And there was a little Œ 
a young man 

walking alongside, and Œ and talking something to Œ to them, in broken French. So 

they said, no, no, no, they didn™t know what he was talking about, thought he was 
begging, or something. But he was persistent, he was foreign, and t
hey couldn

any

A: Yes. And he Œ i n thi s 
Falticeni

A: No, I don™t re Œ I don™t remember.

Œ 
Q: Oh, really?

I mean,

happened over there, absolutely nothing. They Œ  and the y were in deep trouble. 
Although t he y were living very well. 
Romani a
 was rich with oil . The
 Ploie
 oil 

fields, which we crossed, were pumping oil all  the time, and that™s why Germans 

finall y occupied 
Romania
, to get their oil . And 
Bucharest
 was amazing city, much 

more 
Œ ma ybe not that historical, but much more beautiful than 
Warsaw
, frankl y. It 
was planned very well, it had the 
Arc of T riumph 
on t he Œ 
on the 
Œ on the big 
square, like in 
Pari s
, you know, big avenues full of trees and st Œ i-
it was 
Œ it was 
very elegant, the Royal Palace, and all that. B ut later, when Œ when Œ when we 

stayed there, you know, the Œ the Œ the Œ the fascist school came. 
Q: So how long were you in wa Œ 

A: 
[indeci pherable]
 I went to school there. 
Q: Oh, so tell me again, give me a sense, how long did you sta y in 
Romania
 in 
total?  
A: We travel ed a little bit, back and forth, but part of our group left for 
France
. 

The y got visas. We were in contact with m y uncles who lived in 
France
 
then, m y 
mother™s brothers. And the y were both in t he ar Œ French arm y, but they were 

writing very, very dramat ic letters. The y said th-the French do not want to fight. So 

I Œ I don™t know what t o advise you, frankly. It doesn™t look good here, so why 

don™t you sta y in 
Romania
? And about New Year™s day, 1940, we finally received 

 
Interview with Jerzy

post cards from my mother, from 
Warsaw
, saying, you know, with all this German 
stans Œ 
censorship and 
so forth, very vague about 
[indecipherable]
 said, we are 
fine, I hope you are too. Let Œ let™s wait til spri ng, you know, thi s type of saying 
stay there, do not come back. So we knew a little bit, but that was the last contact 

we had with my family until five and a half years later. There was no Œ no Œ 
no way 
to com Œ communi cate. So we stayed. My father got invol ved wit h some kind of 
intelligence work, with some Armenians from 
Lwów
, I believe, who had contacts 
with the Œ with the Soviet s-
sphere of 
Œ so I believe that the y were working on a Œ 
what™s happening after the Germans invaded, or occupied 
Romania
 actually, after 
the fascist school, and what was happening in the Soviet zone, and they were 

contacting t his Polish government i n Œ in Œ in 
Paris
, and t hen in 
London
. There 
was a ki-kind of network of spies, and Polish had Œ government had a very well-
established network
 there. So a friend of ours, who was one of those people before 
the war, engaged m y stepfather into this and some other people; I was kind of 

witnessing these gatherings, were alwa ys very funny, very fanc y, who dressed 

around. But that was the cover of some meetings, which l ater, after the war, my 

stepfather told me t hat this was a

Q: Oka y.

Poland
, because he Œ 
because 

of his past, he was also in the inter Œ milit ary i ntelligence i n Œ in 
Italy
, where the 
Polish army came from the 
Middle East
, yes.
 
Q: So you even started going to school there? 

A: And then I Œ then we d Œ he discovered that there is a public school being formed 

in 
Bucharest
, and that™s where I went, because I still had two years to go before the 

Œ th-the end. So I went to this school, a-and the teachers were most ly people who 

knew something about some subjects, not a prof Œ professional teachers. There were 

no books and things, but there was mostly by memory. B ut I did m y second cl Œ 
my
 
Œ m y first Œ 
m y 
Œ m y class of 
[indeciphera ble]
 which it was Œ and Œ and then we 
had to flee the Germans when they came, so we were es Œ 
escaped.
 
Q: Give me a sense of dates, if you can.  

A: Well, that was i n November in 1940. 

Q: Oka y, so it™s a year Œ the war is in for a year, and the coup takes pl ace then, right

Q: When does the coup take place? 
A: Oh, the to Œ the f Œ I don™t know exactly, but it was i
n 
Œ duri ng the summer, or 

spring. The king abdicated, King 
Karl
 abdicat ed, and he f-fled with his mistress, 
Madame 
Lupescu
, which was known before t he war, through all the newspapers, 
all over the Œ 
Europe
. And 
Œ and his son, 
Michael
 became the king. But he was 
again Œ but he was already degraded in his power, and there was Œ the Œ the General 

Antonescu
, who was t he military leader of this coup, and that™s where the Œ the Œ 

the Œ the fascist regime was install ed. And that ™s where I have this story there, about 

m y two friends, two girls who were Jewish in t his school, and Œ and they wanted t o 

arrest us once, on the street, because we were assoc Œ 
we were

like to be, you know? I am standing for somebody. 

Q: Yeah. Were there m any Jewish refugees from 
Poland
? 

A: About Œ 
[interruption] 
Q: Oka y, so the question was, were there many Jewish refugees from 
Poland
 i n 
Romania
? 

A: Some, because I™ve Œ I Œ I was in that school in

mostly, what I remember were girls. And the other one was Œ was

A: And I have photographs with t hem. And they were very good company, we 
enjoyed tremendously, you know, our wal ks in the park and trying various drinks, 
forbidden then, and Œ and Œ and that™s why Œ t hat™s why we were very cl ose with 

this group, and that™s what I told you happened one da y, which sort of brought me

the moment.
 
Q: So, you know, in some ways in your telling it, I Œ I have the impression that 

there is all t his war, there is this chaos, there is this fear, and yet, at  the same point, 

you™re a teenager, and you™re growing up. 
A: Exactly. Exactly, exactly, you are right. This is what I want to tell people now 
[indecipherable]
 it was not only blood and sweat and suffering, but  it was normal 
life. And it was so much more precious, because it was happening in terrible times. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But you cannot  suppress Œ I mean, the Œ the force of life. And probably it 

happened everywhere, even in the camps. Very human, humorous sit uations, and 

people pick up on t hat, and love and enjoy, even if they suffering. But there are 
decent
 moments when the y suddenly sa y, why not? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: We can laugh also. It will help, or not, but t his is our nature. And not Œ that™s

A: He Œ he Œ he had Œ it was all organized for us, but it was Œ it could not have been

port on the red Œ 
Black
 Sea, in luxury, on a Œ a cruise ship, 
Transylvania
. And 
there were about 600 people there, all Poli sh refugees. And we met many of them 

whom we knew from 
Bucharest
, from cafés, from streets, from cinemas, and so 
forth. So, I Œ I stil l say this is one story t hat is not explored how this was organized, 

this whole evacuati on. Somebody bought the whole ship, and Œ and we didn™t have 

any mone y. We were li ving in a very luxurious apart ment, yes, with t he 
Otis
 

elevators, electric then, and they had the

I find 600 people on that Œ on the boat. I made lot of sketches 
in m y notebooks, of

everybody to the st ation, railroad station on the Asiatic shore. Tickets for the Œ for 

the cars, and we go, 24 hours across

 to the southern

Œ to go into sea. So 
they were just saili ng t oward 
Palestine
, and their crew was abandoning, so the y Œ 
they became victims of a accident, and as a Œ survivors of sea, the y had to be 

accepted by t he British, with Œ that was how they were going around t he Œ the Œ t he 

British blockade, for Jews to go t o 
Palestine
.

before we reached thi s transportation, means of transportation, we were surrounded

they came and the y hel d photographs of people, of their relatives from Œ from

then we Œ we were a ter Œ we Œ under Œ when this, the training, speci al training, but 
suddenly 
t here came an 
Œ an Œ an order to make a choice. Either you want to 

continue the officers™ school, or you volunteer to go to 
England
, to air f Œ to the air 
force, to the paratroopers, or to the navy, whichever. One, two, three desks under 

the stands. One hour time to think about i t. Go.

None of your business. You will get there. Just  sa y yes or no, which wa y

find out on the bow of the ship. So we were Œ we Œ we approach the ship, it was lik
e 

that, like a skyscraper, what is Œ Queen
 Mary
, which was completely empty, 
because this Queen 
Mary
 brought 10,000 Scot tish troops for General 
Montgomery
 
for this offensive, and i t was going back empt y. So what about t his Italian rifles? 

Because you have 1400 German prisoners which you took in 
Libya
. You have to 
escort them. Where? Don™t ask questions. No questions answered, yeah. And we 

had 1400 young boys like ourselves, from t he 
Rommel
 arm y. Germans. And you 
know, and the y were down on the Œ at the bottom of the ship, on the third class. We

 Africa

 to 
Rio de Janeiro
. And we didn™t know why, but three of them 
escaped from the ship in the 
Rio de Janeiro
, and the y were caught on the beach by 

the Brazilian police, and the y were brought  back. So, there were some rough 

moments when one of the Œ our sergeant, who was fluent in German, interrogated

them, and so forth, you know. And it turn out t hat one of the crew Œ 
they were 
mostly Australians, must have given them a bi g wrench, so the y can Œ they opened 

the screws of the Œ 

Q: Porthol es. 

A: Œ portholes, yes, which were screwed in. So that was a first. But t hen, from 
Rio

(ph), we went along the af Œ 
America

coast, to 
New York
. We didn™t 
know where are we goi ng, it was all secret, but we ended up in 
New York
. And we 
unloaded the Germans here, and Œ on the lower 
Hudson
, on 
Jersey City
, again in 
barges. And on those barges, when we were sailing with the Œ our segment of the 

prisoners, now we began to Œ to smile at each other. You know, we were about 19 - 

20, all a Œ both sides. So the y had some pi ece of paper, the y wanted an autograph, 

and I had some photographs, and some drawings that the y made, gave Œ given to 
me, you know, as a kind of exchange. And we handed them over t o the Canadians. 
Put them in the elegant  passenger cars, and took them to the prisoners™ camp in Œ in 

Canada
. 

Q: My goodness. 

A: And we sta yed for two weeks i n Œ in Œ in Œ  in

apart by all these organizations, li ke that one t hat took a couple soldiers for this, for 
this, for dinner, for a dance, and Œ and we stayed for just two weeks, and then sailed 

on Œ on Œ i n a big convoy, and then I decid Œ discovered that there are oh, 

Americans on these shi ps. And then we Œ we Œ  when we learned that

nothing, until 
New York

huge ships were taking troops to Œ to

A: Well, they were t-telling horrendous stories of life in Œ in Œ in the camps. A-A-

And Œ and Œ and the mi racle of them being released at one point. That was a deal 

between Œ between Polish government in 
London

by

really very much understanding the Œ th-t he Œ all this implication, but I was a 
witness of this.  

Q: Well, you know, how could one expect you to? 

A: No. 

Q: How could wa Œ it™s just that one Œ it™s one Œ in your telling it™s one dramatic 
incident after another, without even stopping, you know? And the y come over each 
other. 

A: Exactly. 

Q: It™s not like one starts Œ one st ops and another begins.  

A: Exactly. 

Q: Another takes pl ace while the first one™s stil l going on.  

A:Exactly, exactly, exactly.
 
Q: So, as you™re crossi ng that boat to go t o Œ crossing the 
Atlantic
 again, and you 

see there are 
Americans on the ship, what™s that Œ what™s that stage like? What Œ is 
there anything memorable from that crossing? 

A: Well, he Œ he tal k Œ it took us 15 days. Thi Œ this whole sea strip from 
Suez
, via 
south 
Africa
, 
Rio de Janeiro
, 
New York
, and this is Œ this took six weeks, 
together. And that was the only time when I had a little notebook and I was maki ng

notes, and dates, and what happened then. Not hing i mportant, but just as a 
reference. I still have it. 

Q: Do you still have the notebook? 

A:Yes, yes, y
es. This i s only the Œ the trip, you know, the Œ the sea voyage. Well, 
we were a bi g sensat ion for the American troops on that troop carrier, because they 
were young boys li ke us, going for the first ti me to 
Euro pe
, abroad, you know? 
The y were from 
Kansas
 somewhere, from 
Mi ssouri
, you know, soldiers, 
G
.
I
.
s
. 
And we were sleeping i n hammocks because everything was removed to make more 
room for troops, you know, this Œ on these transport ships. And eleven big ships, 

and the escorts, two cruisers and several destroyers, on Œ  on all sides, cruising al l 

here, you know, watching for the submarines and 
U-
boats. So it was a 

[indecipherable]
 pleasant, but mostly Americans were tell ing us, how is it in t he 
war? What do you do? You know? And we didn™t want to talk about the war, 

frankl y, we were enj oying the Œ t he Œ the Œ the Œ the trip. So, you know. But I Œ I 

learn how t o jitterbug on that ship. I met many American soldiers who were trying 

to say a prayer in Polish, you know? They remember what their grandmother what 

told Œ told, you know? Terribly moving. Which I Œ moving now, but at that ti me
, 

was ha, ha, ha, you know, make fun. 

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: The stars at night, are big and bright, deep i n the heart of

learned that ti me. 

Q: Yeah. When you got Œ 

A: So we ended up in Œ in 
Liverpool
. 

Q: Oka y. 
[technical interruption, break]
 Okay, so you™re in 
Li verpool
, you arrive 
in 
Liverpool
. 
A: We disembark, I thi nk the first, because th Œ I remember Americans on the deck 

waving back, full of soldiers still. And we went onto the train, which was waiting, 

and well, we were only 300, so there was some Œ somebody more than Œ than us. 

Andthen wewent directl y to 
Scotland
, to a camp near 
[indecipherable]
, in 
northern 
Scotland
, and we sta yed there 10 da ys or somet hing. We soon discovered 
that every church has a dance hall, and twice a week there were dances at the 
church hall, where you could meet a lot of lonel y girls. But mostly we were being 
interviewed. Not us, from the brigade, where we were Œ had all our papers and army 

books and so forth, but mostly those who came from the 
Soviet Union
. The y were 
grilled agai n and again, who they are. Later, later, after the war I discover 

[indecipherable]
 you don™t know why, because the Œ the Œ the arm y intelligence 
wanted to k now who these people really are. There was no ti me to int erview them 

in Œ in 
Persia
, or i n 
Iraq
, when the y came, you know, from the 
Soviet Union
, nor

in 
Palestine
. So they were sort of quickly selected who wanted to go, so they were 
on the boat, and came. But the Œ t he arm y wanted know exactly who t hey are, like Œ 

like you are asking me now. Where they came from, the addresses and Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ father Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ and mother and so forth, you know, for security. Because there was already a 

we Œ awareness that m any, many Soviet agent s could be smuggl ed this wa y. 

Q: Yes. 

A: So, the y already knew that. So we sta yed there, and then finally they Œ 
we were 

separated int o various arms forces, units t hat we volunteered for. Those for the air 

force, those for the navy, those for the parachute brigades, and Œ and Œ and Œ and we 
parted in different places of Œ and that™s where I begun about almost a year and a 
half training in vari ous, as it was called, stations of Œ of the air force. It was all 

manned by the Polish ar Œ air force already, all  instructors, all teachers. Except the 

teachers of English were Œ were Polish people. And then it Œ it Œ it took us about 

that ti me to Œ to reach the Œ the Œ the level where we could be transferred to Œ 
to the 

Œ to the front.  

Q: So here™s a question. 

 
Interview with Jerzy

A: It was j ust after the 
D
-
Day
. 
Q: So here™s a question: do you think any of your trainers at the Œ during this year 
and a half were peopl e you first might have met at the Romanian border, as you 

were fleeing 
Poland
?  
A: No, no, no. 
Q: No. 
A: It was such a mi xture of Œ of people, mi xing all the ti me. But I always had very 

good friends, and one of my best friends was a 
Ludwig
 Gutmei er
(ph),
 
speaking 
about the Jewish people, who was with me from Œ from the ti me t he brig Œ I didn™t 

know him at the ti me we were in Œ in 
Libya
. We met on the boat, actually, in t hat 
group. And he was a son of a Œ of 
Aba
(ph)
 Gutmeier
(ph), a very well-known art 
dealer
, and collector of Polish art, ma ybe better than this, in 
Warsaw
. And he had a 
sister, whom he adored, he had a pi cture of Œ of her sister, was showing. And he 

escaped 
Warsaw
 during the, actually, German siege and bombardment, which 
means about 10 da ys after me. How he managed to Œ to escape, I don™t know. 

Because f
rankly, we never talked about thi s. Never. The discussions were about 
today, right now, and what we are going to do tomorrow. But never Œ never 

reminiscences, somethi ng Œ  

Q: It was not that kind of time.  

 
Interview with Jerzy

A: No, nobody Œ nobody was interested, frankl y. What are we tal king? What are we 
going to do tomorrow? Have another beer. You know, this was Œ that™s Œ that™s Œ 

that™s the lesson, but Œ which I learn only recently, when I started to write this Œ this 

Œ this Œ this books, this memoirs, were 50 years after the war when I started. 

Q: Why? Wh
y did it take so long? 
A: I never Œ  I was never interested in Œ in Œ in Œ in Œ whil e I was collecting all the 
photographs, all the drawings of all these wanderings after the war Œ 
I saved 

everything, without even thinking about i t. It was only the first Polish book, there 

were three books, these are condensed three books here. It was pri nted in 
Poland
 in 
2003, and I probably started this writing about  2000, year 2000. 

Q: Yeah, 55 years after the war. 

A: And nobody ask me anything, and I don™t Œ  didn™t ask anybody after the war, 
and I came t o the d Œ completely destroyed city, 
Warsaw
, and we™re planning how 
to spend the night Œ dancing night, you know? But nothing about Œ nobody told me 
about the horrors of they went through, uprisings, and so on, the destruction, 

prisoner camps. Nobody. So this 
Ludwig
 Gutmei er
(ph) was this very good friend, 
and he was with me on this first preli minary stages of tra Œ air force training, but at 

one Œ one point, he said ah, you know, it takes so long. I want to Œ I want to Œ I 

want to bomb the Germans. Said, how you going to do it? He said, well, I Œ 
you

know what? Ther
e i s a 
Œ there is a special t hey call the bomber. On the Œ on the big 
bombers, there is a guy who looks at the target  and pushes the but ton. I want to be 
that guy. So he left 
area,
 because that was much more shorter trai ning. And I met 

Ludwig
 after the war, in 
Paris
, where we spent a very excit ing ti me. And in 1961, 
when I came on the 
Ford Foundation
 visit to 
America
, on m y second da y in 
New 
York
, I met hi m face t o 
face on 
Madison
 Avenue here. 
Yeah.
 
Q: Amazing. Amazing. So, what were you trained for, and what was your job on the 

plane?  

A: I was pi lot, fighter pilot. Which means, I was alone. My job was everything. And 

I was trained to be a speed fighter pilot. And I was posted soon after the 
D-Day
 to a 
Polish wing which consisted of three squadrons, 36 planes in 
France
, on a field trip 

Œ airstrip. And we were in so-called tek Œ tactical air force, which means we were 
supporting the ground t roops. If you saw ﬁ
Pri vate Ryan
,ﬂ there i s a Œ there is a shot 
where airplanes are flyi ng very low over this l oop of Americans who are trying to Œ 
to Œ to escape the encirclement. Well, that™s what we were doing. Air support to the 

ground troops, and Œ and bombing from the dive Œ dive bombing. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So Œ and from t ime to ti me there was an air contact, but the Germans were very 

few and Œ and sparse in those days, because the 
Luftwaffe
 was already Œ  had the

broken back, during the Battle of

, and following years. Last October, I was 
in 
Washington

RAF 
in 
London
 t o be a ke ynote 
speaker on a yearly gal a the y have i n

 to the pilots who fought the Battle of

, in 1940 - ™41. And this was a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ a dinner devoted to t he role of the Polish fighter pil ots, who actually, as 

m y friend 
Steve
, air chief marshal Sir 
Steven Dalton
, who sat next t o me in all this 
gala, gilded things and medals, the commander of the Royal Air Force of today, 

said that, it  is little known, but had it not been for those 120 Poli sh fighter pilots 

who came to 
Engl and
 in 1940, those who were emi Œ 
Q: At the border. 
A: Œ 
atthe border, whomI ma 
Œ who were shi pped i mmediately to 
England
 and
 
France
, and later to 
England
, we would not win this battle, he said, because our 
numbers were dwindling. We had pilots after 15 hours in the plane, sent to this 

quadrant to fight the 
Luftwaffe
. 

Q:Oh m y gosh.That™s nothing.
 
A: It™s nothing. So the y were shot down li ke ducks, you know.

ickens, yeah.
 
A: And Œ and so t he air chief marshal, and Œ then Œ and I was the keynote speaker 

for that event. So t hat™s like the coronation of this whole Œ m y warti me events, 

which happened 50 Œ 55 years later. 
Q: How many missions did you fly? 
A: Hundre d. 
Q: A hundred? 

A: Yeah, just hundred, yes. 

Q: And do you Œ over what territories? 

A: Well, 
France
,
 
Belgium
, 
Holland
 and 
Germany
. And we were three squadrons, 
302,308, m y squadron
, and 317, where I had t his friend, this Jewish pilot, 

Kazik
(ph) 
Becker
(ph). There is the photograph of him, and he had this name of his 
sister chalked on hi s cowling, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I had couple more Jewish pilot s, yes. Th-
Th
-The y were in every squadron, there 
was Jewish and like that. 

Q: What was yourl ast bombing missio
n? 

A: Last bombing mission, we™re preparing for Œ the Poli sh armored division, 

because we are support ing the arm y on the ground, right? So, in the British sector,

there were C anadian force, and Œ and Briti sh, moving on the northern front. 
Americans were further south. And the Polish armored division, t he t anks, arrived 

at 
Wilhel mshaven
, which is the main base of the German 
Kriegsmarine
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Built i n Œ in i mperial ti me, and Œ and it was the Œ we were prepared to support 
the Œ the Œ the attack of this Briti sh armored di vision on 
Wilhel mshaven
, which 
alreadysurrounded by thePolish army. When Imade m y hundred
th, and that was 
the end of my tour Œ the tour was 50, that was m y second tour. So you would Œ 
you 
don™t fl y tomorrow. Pack up, you can go. You have tickets and all that. And I was 
very happy. But then, th-the next few da ys, they started this bombardment, and Œ 

and it Œ and it Œ the war ended soon after that

So  
Œ but Œ but Œ but 
the capitulat ion of 
Wil helmshaven
 
was accepted by th
e Polish kal 
Œ

Œ of the arms division. 

Q: That must have been satisfying. 

A: And thi s is an amazi ng coincidence because the war started in 
Gdansk

bombardment by 
Schleswig

, the German battleship of the Polish outpost 
in 
Gda nsk
 
called

coincidence.

Q: How did you Œ so that happened in Apri l ™45? 
A: Well, it Œ it Œ it Œ 
I was 
Œ I left this quadrant in April, and they were still fl yi ng 
til the y Œ til the first days of May, when the armi stice was. And from Œ by that ti me, 

I was in 
Paris 
already, with myuncle.
 
Q: So here Œ here™s another question. Of those hundred mission Œ 
hundred missi ons, 
were there any that you felt more i n danger than in others, or were each Œ all of 
them equally alike? 

A: Well, th-the Œ there were not all, because you know, someti mes you were going 

on a patrol, very hi gh up, escorting American bombers, the flying fortresses, few 

times. But most of the real danger was because we were coming down on German 

positions, which were very heavily defended by theanti
-aircraft guns and machi ne 

guns. And when you were coming down t here, everybody was shooti ng at you. So it 
was touch and go. And som
eti mes 
we are flying two and t hree missions every day. 
Q: My gosh. 
A: Because we were very close, you know, it lasted one hour. You took off, one 

hour you wereover the 
[indecipherable]
, you bomb, 
you 
Œ you come down, you Œ 
you shoot, and you come back. So it was Œ it was a lot of the sum Œ you were Œ 

found bullets in the fuselage. A couple friends were killed sa Œ many were killed 

because the y landed in the fog, or somethi ng li ke that, you know.

Q: When the war started, you had had one year of Jesuit school, which knocked you 
into shape after Œ after having been a troubled teenager, and when t he war ended, 

you were Œ you were a fighter pilot with a hundred missi ons under your belt. Were 

you the same person? How had t he war changed you? 

A: No much. No, but in between, I had two years of the refugee schools in 
Bucharest 
and 
Tel Aviv
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: Which were a salvation, because since that time, I did not read a si ngle book 

during the war. There was no wa y. I read some English books when I learned. But 

aft Œ when I arrived in 
Warsaw
 after the war, and wanted to join the school of 
architecture, I was accepted without any tests, or anything. But m y Œ m y level of 
education 
was zero
, I must tell you frankly, zero. Because I did not have full cycle 
of education like normal school. So I Œ I Œ I s Œ I suppose I learned myself.  
Q: But as a person, you say you™d Œ your Œ as a person you didn™t  feel like you had 
changed much?
 
A: I didn™t feel that I have. I didn™t , no, honestly.

Bucharest
 

with saving these t wo Jewish girls. It was like nothing, but it is Œ it made an impri nt 

in me.
 

Q: For you it was a significant threshold. 
A: Absolutely, yes. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I was so happy later, that we did this, what we did. And the y run away, so you 

know Œ but Œ 

Q: So when you met your stepfather in 
Paris
, afterwards, is this t he time when he 

told you what he was involved wi th?  

A: Very little, but he told me that, you know, what you know is probably a fraction 
of what I would like to tell you, but there i s no time now. One da y when we meet in 
quiet, I can tell you yes, yes, I was involved in this, I was involved, yes, all these 

people that you mention, yes, wa Œ it was a cover up for something, and suppose 

and suppose. And that™s where I went to Œ to serve in the second army corps, which 

was mostly composed ofthearm y whocame from

A: No, he came, and they met Œ you know, they were married two years, actually,

Q: Well,when you came backto 
Warsaw

A: What di d I find?  

Q: Yeah. 
A: I found m y home, mostly intact. Half of it was burned, you know, the Œ the Œ 
there was a four corners in a square, and the backyard. And so the front was where 

our house was, our apartment. The whole l ength of this nine windows, and Œ and the 

lithography,  built by my grandfather in 1893 was on the left, for four stories high. 

And then the two other wings were residences three stories high, also built by hi m 

in the Œ in the end of 19

stopped by itself. 
Q: Did your mother tell  you how she survived during the war?

supervision. And I know that the y were printing a lot of illegal documents from the

needed something, like before the war. And si nce this survived t he Œ the Œ the total

Œ and she was almost one of the first persons who returned to

Germans, after this uprising, expelled everybody. So it was a tot ally vacant ruin, 
city of ruins. Over a mi llion peopl e were expel led. The dead were Œ 

Q: Where di d she go? 
A: Hm?  
Q: Where di d she Œ 

A: She went to suburban location somewhere. And Œ and survived that Œ that Œ that 

few months there, and then came back, one of the first, and stood in front of the 

building. Shesaid, my

m y 
mouth opened. How did it survive? And she went 
through the gates, you know, for the Œ and sai d, lith-lithography is also there. The 

other two wings are burned down. And then t he Œ and then the workers started t o 
take in, you know, all t he people from somewhere, who are coming, checking, and 
they were finding, so she Œ she assembled a group of people who started to clean, 

and Œ and sort of revive the whole thing. And it was the communist government 

who took i t in ™49, and Œ and really destroyed everything. The y said there isn™t a
