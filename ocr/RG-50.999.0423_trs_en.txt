W hen 
Nazi Germ any took over and divided Czechoslovakia, 
Botragy f ell under Hungarian rule.  Ireneandher siblings couldnot attend school,andher 
father, along with thousandsof other Jewish m en, was conscripted intoforced laborfor six 

m onths in 1942. T heFogels were m oved into the Munkacs ghetto,where they lived in a brick 

factory.  Thearrow points to Munkacs.
 
 
In May
 
1944, Ireneand herfam ily were deported to 
A u sch wit z-
Bi rkenau. The arrow pointstoAuschwit z.  Irene andhersister, Serena, were 
se le ct ed  
f or forced l

1945 to other cam ps in 
Germ any.  Fortunately the liberation by theSoviet Arm y of the Neustadt

Glewe camp
,  
indicated by the second arrow, where Irene and Serena worked near the endof  the war, left 

the girls unguarded
,  
and they were able tom ake their wa y to 
Prague

Of

>> Bill Benson:  Irene, thank you som uchf orjoining us today,f or your wil lingness to be our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
. There isso muchfor you to tellus, and we have just less than an hourf or you 
to  
do it. So it's abig challenge.  So we better start I think right away. 
 
 
You describeform e the timef or youand your fam ily in 
Czechoslovakia, bef ore W orld W ar II and
 
the Holocaust, as a tim e of hard work but alsoa 
good lif e,one in whichthere was a sense of  saf ety.  Spend justafew m om ents telling us about 

that life bef orethe war.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, yes, we were a fam ily of  six children. Andour parents concentrated on 

raising the children, protecting the children,educating the children. Ourf ather worked,m other 

worked ver y hard.  Inthosedays wom endidn't have any modern equipmentto helpthem .So 

it was work f rom m orning till night.  It was anorm alfam ily. W e observed religious events. W e 

went to school. I was 13 years old when all of this ended.W e played in the neighborhoodwith 

other children. It was just anorm al lif eof  daily concerns and daily chores.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How large was the Jewish
 
population in the community where you li ved?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  It was a very sm all farm ing town where we lived.  The Jewish populationwere 

just 10f am ilies. The total number with the children and so on were about100 persons.
 
>> Bill Benson:  About 10% of the population.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  About 10%.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had said to me that there really 
--
 
to your knowledge, there wasn't m uch 
anti
-
Sem itism atthat tim e.  W ill you say a little more about that?
 
>> IreneW eiss: T here wasn't.  My f ather was born there.  
H
isf atherwas born there.  My 
father was 47 years old when it all ended. He grew up with the other people in the town.

Knew him  well as a young m an and so on.  He had a sister who also gre w up there. They 
were part of  the community, the general comm unity.  It really was a peacef ul lif e with the 

neighbors until suddenly things changed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we m ove to the changes that occurred,tell us a little bit about your 

Aunt Roseand Pearl. You're going to talkm ore about them  later. 
 
Just tellus a little aboutwho 
they were.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Roseand Pearl were m y mother's sisters. They were in their m id20's.T hey 

lived just af ew kilom eters away f rom us. They were the daughtersof m y grandf ather. They 

were also 
--
 
m y grandfathe
r's entire fam ily, they wer
e also deportedto Auschwitz, about the 
day bef ore we were, in April.  By sheer chance we actually m et up with them there, which Iwi ll 

tell you later. Saved my lif e andm y sister's life. 
 
 
T hey were wonderf ul aunts.W hen we were younger, they 
played with us. T hey carried usaround. They read to us. W e were ver y attached to them .  So 

when we m et up with them in Auschwitz later, it really changedoursituation, our em otional 

situation.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Iknow you'll tell us m uch more about that.
 
 
By the time Germ any invaded Poland inSeptem ber
 
1939, 
launchingW orldW ar II, your comm unity already experienced profound change. Hungary was 

an ally of  Nazi Germ any, and earlier in 1939 your com munity hasbeen occupied by 

Hungarians
,  
which imm ediately changed your lives.  T ell us what you can about thattime 
under Hungarian rule.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. As you say, the Hungarian governm ent was allied with Nazi Germ any.  

So they proceeded tocarry out the same kind of discrim ination
 
against Jews as the Germ ans 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

did. T hey initiate
d 
laws to restrict thef reedom s of Jews.  Right away Jewish children couldn't 
go to the schools. I had been sent
 
--
 
I had todrop outof  the schoolI was attending.  All our 
f reedom s were takenaway. W e couldnottravel by train. W e couldnotown property.  My 
father's business was conf iscated. W e hadto wear a yellow star.  In general, we were 

exposed to any kind of hum iliationand m istreatmentby those who chosetodo that because 

the law was on their side andnot on our side. W e were victim ized.  It was approved by the 

l a w.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith your father losing hisbusiness, how was thefam ily able tom ake ends 

m eet, to be able to putfood on the table?
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes, it became very diff icult. He stayedat home doing chores around the 

house.  Everybody had livestock to helpf eedthefam ilies. He attended to that. He was no 

longer a businessm an.
 
 
Money was ver y tight.  None of  it was spent.W elived off all the 
things we got f rom  the farm ers. Everything was cookedand bakedfor thefam ily.  Nothing was 

bought besides m aybe salt and occasional sugar.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he most essential.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  T he m ost essential.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned you could nolonger go to the school you were in.  You ended 

up, I believe, going toschool in another comm unity. T ellus about that. 
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, in m y little town school endedat sixth grade.My parents
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Period.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Period.  No one else. T hefarming children, children of thefarm ers,thatwas 

ok because they needed to be working in the f ields. Butm y parents looked to f ind a way to 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

continue our education.  So af ter sixth grade I was sent to the bigger city nearby, a large city 
called Munkacs. I comm utedby train tom iddle school until we were told to wear the yellow 

star, at which point it was not safefor me to be in a different community with a yellow star.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were com muting by yourself, Ibelieve.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  I was comm uting by train.  Of tenI was theonly one getting on thetrain inm y 

town because it was aone
-
t ra ck t o wn
,  
and often the train stopped justf orm e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Justf or you. 
 

>> IreneW eiss: T o go elsewhere, to be in the trainand in a new place with a yellow star was 

m uch too dangerous. Besides, the law said that I could no longer attend Hungarian schools.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkit was aroundthat time that you had af rightening experience on the 

train with your f ather.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes, indeed. Things became very dangerous.  My father and I were on the 

train to goto thenearby town, just about af ive
-
m inute ride.  He was resting where he was 
identif iable as being aJewish m an.W e were alm ost at our station back hom e when abunch 

of  youn
g m e n
 
--
 
I call them hoodlum s 
--
 
cam e up to him  andbegan to talkamong them selves 
about how they were going to throw him  off the train.T hey laughed. They carried on. T hey 

spoke rudely to him  and telling each otherhow, well, let's do it
 a
nd how about 
sta rtin g to  do  it.  
I was 13 years oldand terrified, wondering whether we'll m ake ithom e saf ely, whether the train 

wi ll stop and we can get off bef orethis stuff would actually happen.  
It so
 
happened that itwas 
a short ride and we got off very f rightened and shaken. 
 
 
W eheard of other stories about a Jewish m an being thrown off 
trains, anywhere en route. Itbecam e open season, af ree

hum iliate Jewish menand topickf ights with them knowing thatthey would be winning and 
nobody would
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had no recourse. There was nothing you could do.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  No recourse.  Couldnot bring a suit
 
or complain because you were not a 
citizen by this tim e. Even if  you were born in the country, your citize nship was denied. T here 

was absolutely noprotection.  It'sanextrem ely f rightening feeling whenthe law doesn't protect 

you andthat others have access tohum iliateyou andtom istreat you and to cause you bodily 

harm .  It'sm oref rightening to deal with otherhumanbeings than it is with the law. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  And in this case the law expli citly wasn't on your side.
 
>> Irene W eiss
:  Yes. It was open and acknowledged that we had no rights. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1942 
--
 
and would continue for several years under those circum stances
;  
and in 1942 yourfather, along with thousands of  other Jewish m en, were forced by the 

Hungarians to dof orced laborf or them ilitary.  Tell us about yourf ather's conscription into the 

forced labor battalion and what thatm eantf oryour f am ily. 
 

>> IreneW eiss: W ell,we heard that them en, the young m en who were conscriptedand taken 

away
,  
were not soldiers.  Jewish m en were not given guns. T hey were taken to thef rontand 
usedasm ine sweeping and other kinds of most dangerousexposure.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
By m ine sweeping, literally thatm eans walking into am inef ield.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right.  Right. T hey were expendable.  So it was very f rightening to know that 

hem ay never come back.  And, infact, mostof  the young mennever cam e backf rom  those 

early 
days.  T hey were  killed.
 
 
My f ather was allowedto com eback
, 
because apparently at that 
pointthey still returned m en who had largef am ilies.  Since he had six children
, 
he did come 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
back and stayed home, again withouthis business,until we were then deported to Auschwitz 
in 1944.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But he was gonef or afull six m onths,I believe.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes,he was.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because you were so young, do you rem em ber both him leaving andthen 

com ing back after those six m onths?
 
>> Irene W
e iss:  Oh , ye s, def in ite ly. 
 
W he n he  l ef t , of  cou r se, 
again, thefeeling of 
helplessness.  You don't hearf rom  him .  You don't know how he's being treated.
 
>> B ill B
enson:  Youmight noteven know if
 
he was alive.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  No, we didn't, until he showed up again. Strangefor our children.  Hehada 

little beard when he left.  And whenhe cameback,hedidn'thave the beard. I rem em berhow 

we stared athim and barely recogni zed him . He was like a new person. But very gratef ulhe 

cam e back in one 
piece.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And as bad as things were under the Hungarians, they would turn profoundly
,  
andtragically, so m uch worse, when the Germ ans cam e in 1944. That was af ter two m ore 

years between yourf ather'sf orced conscription to when the Germ ans c
am e.  T hings changed 
im mediately.  T ellus about that tim e.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, yes.  T he Hungarian governm ent didmakemany restrictions and took 

away our ri ghts and liberties and property, but they didnot expel their Jewish citi zens.  But 

when the Ge
rmansoccupied Hungary, they were now in charge.  They were well preparedf or 

theexpulsion of Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy did the Germ ans all of a sudden come inand occupy the landof  what 

hadbeen their ally? 
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right.  By 1944, the war had turned, and it was quite obvious to the 
Hungarian governm ent and everyone that Germ any would be losing the war.  And Hungary 

decided thatthey were on the wrong side and decided to pull out of the alliance. And at this 

pointGermany actually invaded Hungary andoccupied Hungary.  So they were in complete 

charge. 
 
 
Even though they were  losing the war and was late, just about a 
year or so before they actually lost the war, thef irst job, theirf irst task
,  
was to collectthe 
Jewish populationand deport them into Germany, Poland,and the various concentration 

cam ps.  Actually,f or a governm ent that was
 
--
 
that needed its resources, its soldiers, railroads 
andallf or the war purposes, instead concentrated on using all of those f acilities to gather up 

anddeport their Jewish population.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Especially, as you said, atthis point we were losing the war.  So they were in 

s o r t  of
 
--
 
f rom  a m ilitary standpoint, they wer e in desperate straits.
 
>> I r e n
eW eiss:  Yes. It was the f irst job. Actually in ever y country in Europethat they 
occupied, that was thefirst job. They becam e ver y eff icient doing that.  They sent in their 

henchmen who were in charge, im mediately requisitioned the necessary trains
. 
 
They 
organized the Jewish population, gathered them  into larger groups. W ithinone month of 

Germ any occupying our area, onem onth
, 
we were all in ghettos and gathering places. They 
pulledus out of our hom es. W e had to abandonall that we had and leave
 
our hom e with a 
suitcaseeach. W e were transported into these large gathering areas, which were usually a 

factory of  som e kind, a brick factory in this case where they had barracks andfacilities. 
 
 
So inno tim e we f ind ourselves out of generations of l
ivin g in  
the same town and in the sam e house, abandoning ourproperty and our home.  W e were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
gathered into crowded conditions, into a ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson: T housandsbeing brought in
to
 
t h is b rick f a ct o ry.
 
>> IreneW eiss: T housandsfrom all the regions,
 
f rom all the smaller towns into this larger city.  
W ehad no idea of ourfate.  How long wi ll we be there? W ill we come back? W hat is their 
plan? 
 
 
W hen you considerafam ily with six children ranging in age 
f rom about7 to 17, you find yourself out of your home and your routine anddependent on 

whatever f ood andnecessities they will gi ve you. It's terrif ying.  Looking back,m y parents 

should have been them ostfrightened andagonized about what was going on because they 

could not protect their childre
n.
 
>> Bill Benson:  No. There's six of  you and your parents. W hen they began, when the 

Germ ans began,deporting the Jews outof  Hungary, the numbers are staggering.  If I 

rem em ber correctly, approxim ately
 
--
 
I thinksom ething like 450,000 Jews were gathe
red a
s 
you described into ghettos andover about a six
-
week period, I believe, deported to 
concentration anddeath cam ps.
 
 
Sof or you, af ter being in this ghetto, you wouldn't be there long 
bef ore you were sentwith your fam ily to Auschwit z.
 
>> Irene W eiss
:  Yes. W e were there about four weeks.  And the conditions deteriorated. It 
was terrible.  You have people of all kinds, older people, sickpeople, pregnant wom en, young 

babies, all kinds of hum an conditions.  It was terrible. T he persecution there was
 
intense.  
T hey would call out the m en in them iddle of the nightor in them iddle ofthe dayf or 

interrogation,dem anding valuables. T here wouldbe beatings.  People would com eback 

bloody.

T here was,f or exam ple
 
--
 
well, they m ade an announcem ent 
that
 
affected me, which saidall girls under 16 should report to a certain place to have their hair 
shaved or theirf atherswould be beatenand punished. So without am om ent's notice
, 
I ra n to  
the tent where this was happening, and they shaved m y hair. I had
 
long, blond
e  
braids.  
Somehow it didn't occur tom ethat I should be worried about thatbecauseI was thinking of m y 
father and how thatm ight 
a
ff ect him . I cam eback to where m y mother was
,  
and she was 
appalled. She gave me a kerchief  to putonm y head.  Andf rom then on, that's what
 
--
 
I 
covered m y head.
 
 
As it happens, later when we arrived in Auschwit z, it had a 
prof oundeffect onm y survival there
,  
which I'll talk about.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok. 16 years old at thatpoint.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W ell, no. I
'm  13. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  13.  With your head shaved. It was girls under 16 who hadtheir heads 

shaved.  So you'reforced to go to Auschwit z.  I know it's very hard to f ind the words to 

describe that, but tell us about going there and what happened.
 
>> I r e
neW eiss:  Afterfour weeks living in cro wded, hum iliating conditions
 
--
 
we had no bath.  
W ehad no change of clothes. W e had very l ittlef ood.W e were nolonger thehum an beings 

that we were before. You can im agine the condition when thatmany ci vilian
s of  all types are 

not given proper careor facilities.
 
 
So thenone day, a long cattle trainarrived on theprem ises of 
this brickf actory which had a railroad sidingfor their own 
--
 
their own purposes. W e were 
herded into the train. 
 
 
Again, no one ever told us what thenext step is.  In other words, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
14
 
no comm unication because we didnot matter. W e were like cattle. Herd them in.  Herd them  
into the train. Lock the doorf rom the outside.  Everybody is sitting o n thef loor of  thetrain, 

m
en and wom en separate,by their own choicef orm odesty sake.  Abig bucketput in the 
centerof  the trainfor the toilet.  You're locked in. It's dark.  Noone tells you where you're 

going or wh y this is happening to you.  You have children.  You can't give them any ans
we r s .   
You don't have any answers.  So it's very 
--
 
very, very f rightening.  Wenever heard of  
Auschwitz, but we didhear of rum ors thatthe Jews in Poland
 
were killed in large groups by
 
Germ an Nazi soldierswho would gather them  into theforestareasand shoot them  andbury 

them  in large graves there.  So that rumor is what we thoughtm ight beourfate,that whenthe 

trains stop, we m ightfind ourselves in thef orest in Poland being met by af iring squad. 
 
 
In the train,m y f atherwould look out a small windo w and look 
to
 
see thedirection, trying to see if he canf ind the direction thetrain was going.  Atone pointhe 

said that, yes,he recognized the area that the train was switching towards Poland.  So without 

anybody telling us any m ore
, 
we  fe lt tha to
urfate was sealed. Great anxiety andfear. 
 
 
Af ter about two days and two nights
,  
thetrain stopped.  Began 
looking outthe small window.  My f ather was assessing the situation.  He said this looks like 

thereare barracks here, guard towers, fences.  He saw m en inprison uniforms.  It seemed like 

it was som e kind of awork cam p.  He passed it on to the people inthe car, cattle car. 

Ever ybody calm ed down and f elt a littlemore secure.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because it wasn't thef orestwhere you thought you would be shotto death.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. So itm ight seem
 
--
 
it seemed to every
one that, well, if  it's a labor cam p, 
a work cam p, perhapswe can survi ve this trial also.  So people were m uchm ore calm than 

they had beenon thetrip up to thatpoint.

So soon thetrains were openedf rom theoutside. T here were 
great dealof  shouting
 
and yelling, in Germ an, to getout, to get out,quickl y get out and leave 
ever ything behind.  Soever ybody was jum ping out the train.  Allourbelongings 
--
 
as soon as 
we were out of the train, all our belongings were dumpedout on the platform.W e saw t
ru cks 
on theplatform . These prisoners were picking up all the belongings and throwing them onthe 
t ru cks.  

 
T he shock of realizing that not only were we going to lose the 
la s t  lit t le  b it of b e lon gin gs
,  
but allof  those precious papers, identif ication pape
rs that showed 
who you were, where you cam ef rom , where you belonged. W ithoutpapers, you arenothing.  

T here is no record of  your existence.  And that, too, was thrown outwith ever ything else.  So it 

hits you that you're nothing, and no one will ever accountfor you here. T here is no possibility 

that youbelong anywh ere. 
 
 
So to imagine such afeeling is def initely a sense of desperation. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you areforced off the train.  It's you and your parents and yourf ive 

s ib lin gs .  
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. W e weref orced off. Thousandsof people cam eoutof a long train. T he 

platf orm  was totally f illed. Of  course,the shouting continued aboutm en toone side and 

wom en and children to the other side.  So m y father and 16

old brother join
ed  t he  gr ou p  
of m entotheone side.  W ehad no idea thatwe'll never see them  again.  And the wom enand 

children andelderly kept m oving up the platf orm .  Pretty soon we didn't see thef ront of the 

platf orm , what was going on at thef ront. Butpretty soon we were up in the f rontandf ound 

ourselves facing about a dozen Nazi soldiers with dogs and weapons.  One in particular was 

separating people at great speed, withoutmuch deliberation.  Alm ost immediately he

separated Serena, m y 17

old sister, andsenther to one side.  It seem ed like other young 
adults were also going, being sent to that side.  And then quickly hem otioned m y mother and 
two little brothersto another side. W ebecame aware that wom en and children andelderly 

seemedtobe going on that side.  And then there was still
 
--
 
m y younger sister andI were lef t 
holding hands.  He was looking atus. And not being abletoapparently f igure outm y age
, 

becausem y head was shaved and I was wear ing a kerchief and heavy coat and
 
looked m ore 
lik e  
a young wom an
 
perhaps
,  
so in a m atter 
o f  s i x 
seconds,he separated the two of us and 
sentm e going towards the young adults.
 
>> Bill Benson: W here Serena was?
 

>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. And senther to wherem y m other and younger children went. If roze 

there
. Ididn'tm ove.  I just stood there leaning towards where m y little sister went
,  
hoping to 
see that she caughtup with our m other. I couldn't see. There werebarriers there.  I was 

desperately worried that she will not catchup with them . T here were crowds m oving.  She 

was but 12 years old. I was just besidem yself  with worr y that she will be alone. I suddenly 

forgot that I, too, was aloneat this point. 
  
Af ter standing therefor a mom ent, I was m otioned to 
go towards the youngadults.  
 
 
T o d i gr e s s
 
a littlebit, about 25 years af terI was liberatedand I 
was in this country, I cam e acrossa book called
 
--
 
it was analbum . It seem sthat the German 
soldiers were taking pictures, photographs,of theparticulartrain arrival on which we were and 

taking
 
picturesof all the steps of processing the new arri vals, getting off the train, being 
separated, and going in all the different directions. T hosephotographs were keptby a Nazi  

soldier.  It was found af ter liberation by a survivor.  And eventually it was put into an album
, 
which is here in them useum gif t shop.  It's called

get a hold of thatalbum  and looking at it, I recognized m yself exactly in that position whenI 
was standing there alone looking toward thedirection wherem y little sister went. And it seem s 

that
 
--
 
Ihave no idea
 
--
 
I had no idea that I was being photographed,but I was captured inthat 
position. T hat photograph is in thism useum as a visitor m ight com e outof  the cattle car. It is 

on the
 
wall as you come out of the cattle car.It shows a groupof  wom en being separated.  
And it shows m e in one corneralready having been separated
,  
but standing there for a few 
seconds while I was f rozen and notm oving.  It was a most astonishing discovery that there is a 

record of that particular instance.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas the day they happened to be photographing.
 
>> IreneW eiss: T hatwas the day.  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this bookthat Irene showed m e, there's just no words for it.  It's 

s t a gg

others, "

So now you're separated.  You're with the young adults. T h
e 
otheradults and Serena. T ake usf rom there.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. I was running af ter herbecause she hadalready m oved way up a road 

with all the young adults.  I was calling her nam eand yelling f or her to wait for me.  Shef inally 

heardme and turned around. T hef irst thing she said to me, why didn't you go with m om ? 

And I was so very upset and so concerned about m y little sister I didn't evenanswer her. I just 

kept telling her, Edit will never catchup with our m om , she's going to bealone.  She was inthis 

big m ob. T here were so many people. I kepttelling her I tried to see but I couldn't see.
  
Anyway, I was terribly, terribly upset about her ideathat she will be alone in thism ob of

people. 
 
 
W e were taken to be processed in what turned ou
t  t o b e a  
bathhouse where everyone was shaved, ourclothes were taken, disinf
ected, prison clothes, 
one
-
s i ze
-
f it s
-
all kind of clothes.  Our shoes were taken. W e were now altered completely and 
no longer recognizable. 
 
 
At thispoint I hadexperiencedm y second very upsetting 
trauma. In going through stages of this processing, when it came tohaving the hair shaved for 

the wom en, I had skipped the stage because I had already had m y hair shaved. But m y sister 

hadto stay and gothrough that.  And so by the
 
t i me
 
--
 
I gotm y prison clothes andall. 
 
I  wa s  
f inished ahead of  her and m arched out the door
,  
where I saw hundreds ofother wom en 
looking exactly the sam e, with hair shaved, sam e kindof  long, gray dress.  I knew that when 

m y sister comes out the door, I will not recognize her
,  
because suddenly it was just im possible 
to see who was who.  So Inow becam eterrif ied thatI won't meet up with her.
 
 
So you have people,aclose, unitedf am ily, torn apart stageby 
stage.  Andall of a sudden
, 
we're divided up intoparts. Herem y little sister is som ewhereout 
there. Iam alone andunable to connect with m y sister.  My f ather and brotherare som ewhere 

else.  It was just very conf using.
  
For me, at the age of  13, terrif ying.  
 
 
I was pushed out thedoor.  I stood by the door.  I didn'tm ove.  
Howe ver, I becam e aware of thef act that those who had already com eoutthe door, the 

wom en, were being counted off andm arched off  towards barracks. So I keptf alling backand 

back,nottobe taken.  And yelling her nam e ever y tim e the door opened.  I would yell her 

name. She wasn't com ing.  She wasn't coming.
 
 
So eventually a young wom an f rom  our townwho cam eout the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
door andheardm e calling her nam eand recognized the name andm y voice, she said tom e 
thatI know Serena is still back there,and I'll stay with you and help you to recognize her when 

she com es out. So that's what happened.  Between the two of  us, mainly she helpedm e when 

Serena cam eout so that we were thenm arched off together. Suddenly m y heart stopped 

beating a little slower. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And then am azingly you woul d connect with your aunts.  How did that 

happen?
 

>> Bill Benson:  Yes. My m other's two sisters.  My grandf ather's, grandmother'sfam ily.  They 

were brought toAuschwitz the day before. W e didn't know that exactly.  But when the 

Hungarian transportswere arri ving in Auschwit z, the trains were com ingfrom all the gathering 

areas,day and night.  Literally day and night, thetrains,one af ter another.  Many tim es there 

were t wo trains on the platform  at the sam e tim e.  As we saidbefore, it was theonly large 

Jewish group rem aining in occupied Europe.  The war was ending wi th the Germ ans,and they 

were rushing to bring this last groupand do thef inal solution,the genocide, on this remaining 

group. 
 
 
So when we all arrived, they really didn't have im mediate work 
assignm ents or barrack assignm ents. Therewas a great rush of crowds and people.  Somost 

of  the tim e we were tosit outside on the ground, in between the barracks f rom morning till 

night
,  
just waiting to be let in for the night. And then thenext day, again, waiting u
n t il t hey 
decided who goes where.  So while sitting there on the ground, stepping over people, oneof  

m y aunts literally stepped over usand recognized us. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T otally happenstance. 
 
>> IreneW eiss: T otally an amazing thing
,  
because there were thousands of  people in every 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
direction sitting around, standing around. 
 
 
T hat really, f orm e, meant
 
as if  Ihad m y mother backnow.  
Because eventhough they were only in their m id 20's
,  
tom e they were Aunt Rose andAunt 
Pearl, spoketo them  in am ore
 
represented way.  Because they scooped usup.  Managedto 
arrange that when we were led into thebarracks at night
, 
that we endedup in the sam e 
b a rra cks.  
 
Sof orm e, you know, the terror of  being alone, of being a 
nonperson, just the f rightening feeling
s of mobs of pretty hostile groups
 
--
 
you know, 
ever ybody looking out for them selves, everyb ody upset.  It was justso terrif ying.  All of a 

sudden I had som eone to cling toand som eone to whom  I meant som ething.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fam ily, adults, people that you had grown up with.  Respected. Loved.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right.  And although they didn't havem uch in a way to protect me, Ididn't 

know thefull extent of what they couldnotdo for me. But em otionally they did ever ything for 

m e . 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Irene,there's so muchm orefor 
yo u
 
to tell us. I'm  worried aboutour tim e.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us, once you were selected to stay alive to do labor, tellus what you were 

forced to do. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Eventually they f igured out whattodo with allof  thesem any wom en.  

Some were sent out of Auschwitz to other cam ps in Germ any. W ewere assigned, about 

1,000 wom en were selected and assigned todo work within Auschwitz.  First we were 

tattooed. W e were told
 
that we would bem arched off to a certain area.  Auschwitz had many 
cam ps within camps, separatedby electric wi re
.   S
o they m archedus off to several camps in 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

21
 
an area where the clothing andbelongings that cam eout of the many, m any trains and the 
c lo t h
ing and belongings that cam eoutof  thecrem atorium s were brought herefor storage and 
for the wom en, the prisoners, to work with, toseparate andto categori ze andto get readyf or 

shipmentbackto Germ any.  Because they utilized ever ything thatwas brought by the trains.
 
So we becam e awareof  thefact
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T his was with your two auntsandSerena,too.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Allfour of us.  Here we hadtheurgent problem  ofm aking sure that thefour of  

us arenever separated, which was a daily problem , especially for me.  The selections 

continueddaily by the Germ ans to select outyoung children likem ewho they m issedat the 

platf orm  upon arrival and the sickand olderones. Sothe selectioncontinued.  And I was 

alwa ys vulnerable.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  So itwas a constant risk.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  A constant risk.  So to stay together, the four of  us continued an even m ore 

d if f icu lt  ta s k .
 
 
W ebecam e aware of  this place
 
--
 
one electrical f ence 
separated f rom crematorium  and gas cham ber. We understood n
ow what people told us when 

we arri ved. W hen wefirst arri ved, we askedthe prisoners who hadcom e beforeus
 
--
 
th e first 
thing we asked them  is, when do we all get tosee our parents?  Andourf amilies? They ver y 

crudely pointed to some chimneys in 
t he  
distance. And they said, "That is where your parents 
went when you arrived  and they were dead within ahalf
-
hour of arrival."  And we lookedat 
them  like there was som ething wrong with these people. W e said to each other,how could 

they say such things? 
 
W equickly dism issed it.  There were some strange things going on 
here thatpeople could talk like that. But now that we were next
-
door to the crem atorium and 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

22
 
the gas cham bers
,  
notonly did we see the daily entering of huge crowds of people through 
th a t 
gate and the chimneys belching smoke and fire, but we understood that those people who 
told us those things were right.
 
 
Our barracksfaced a roadthat cam ef rom the trainplatform , 
passing the window of our barrack, and go into the gatethat opened upfor
 
them where the 
gas chambers and crem atorium s were. So there was of tena backup,becausethe killingwent 
on day andnight
,  
but the trains kept com ingday andnight.  So there was a backupof  
actually
 
--
 
of killing.  So of tenthese huge crowds of  wom en, children, andelderly would sit 
down on the road inf ront of our window waitin g f or their turn.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right in f ront of where you were working.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Right in frontof  where we were working.  T hey saw us, a
nd probably took 

s o m e c om f o r t
 
f rom seeing us.  And they would try
 
--
 
they would callout to us like, where are 
you f rom ? W hat's your name?W e couldn'ttell them  anything, becausethe gate would open 

soonand they were totally trapped.T here was nothing tobe said. The gate would o
pen.  

T hey would enter. And within a half
-
hour you would seethe belching of  thef ireand smoke 
even harder.
 
 
W ealso worked at night in this place because there was so 
m uch stuff to sortout.  There were m ountainsof  eyeglasses andm ountains of shoes and
 

m ountains of toothbrushes andtoothpaste, books even,baby carriages, pots andpans, 

suitcases, clothing.
 
 
Ever ything thatpeoplebrought with them ,thestuff  was literally 
as high asthe roof of  the barrack.  Between two barracks as high as the roof .  W e
 
would work 
at the baseof  them ountainand just keep pulling stuff  outand worki ng day andnight. W e 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

realized thatthese arepeople who aredead. W hen you seem ountains of baby carriages and 
baby shoes and all kinds ofhousehold things, you know that thesepeople will never see
 
--
 
never be alive to seethis again.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, you would stay in those circum stancesf oreight extraordinarily long 

m onths. But in January of  1945, you're still with your two auntsandyour sister.  TheSoviets 

are 
approaching.  So it's the Germans,the Nazis, decidedto shutdown Auschwitz and m ove 
you outand you were forced on a Death March.  In the tim e we have, tell usabout where you 

went with your aunts and your sister and what happened before your liberation.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Yes.  W ell, we heard the war approaching by gunf ire
 
and noises of  
weapons. W ethought, ok, two things,eitherwe'll be liberatedor they'll kil l us all just 
--
 
a ll ju s t  
in tim e.  Because we were nothing to them . W edidn'tthinkthey would leave theevidence.  

W e expected to be killed.
 
 
Instead,for som e strange reasonthat the Germ ans had, they 
decided to evacuate the cam pandf orced usout. January, in the
 
snow, in ver y cold weather, 
on
to the roads to literally go on a Death March, deeper into Germ any.  Som e people thought of 

staying, hiding.  My t wo auntsdiscussed it wi th others. Should we try to hide, try to go? The 

decision was very diff icult tom ake because,again, we thought that those who stay, they'll 

probably burn the barracks down with thepeople in them .  And even though it's cold andwe're 

too weak to march,the gate is open, we're going out of here, so let's just take that chance. 
 
 
W ell, neitherdecision was the right one.  Howe ver, in 
retrospect, those who stayed and hid had a chance to be liberatedwithin two weeks.  The 

Russian Arm y approached there. T hoseof us who left, thousands of us,huge numbers died 

because tom arch without proper clothing and shoes in January, through Poland into Germany.

>> Bill Benson: 
 
And an even especially brutal winter.  More than norm al.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  It was one of the coldest winters, we f ound out later.  
W
e were heavily 
guarded. People whocouldn't walk
,  
or even held onto som eone
,  
were shot. The roadside was 
f illed with dead
 
bodies.  They didn't have us stopand rest.  Certainly we had nofoodor water.  
W edidn'thave properclothing.  It was literally a Death March.
 
 
O c c a s io na lly

well, they m arched us into another camp,a very 
huge cam p called Ravensbruck
, 
which was over
f lowing with people f rom  other cam ps that they 
brought there.  So, again, we hadtoactually sleepoutside thef irstfew nights.  T here was no 
room for anyone. There was chaos.  I rem ember sleeping thef irst night outside. If ound a 

newspaper f lying arou

vi vidl y that If ellasleep, and itfelt so goodand warm  and comf orting to sleepoutthere. T hey 

woke m e up
, m
y sister.  I realize now I was beginning tof reeze.  Because it was just too calm  
and peacef ul.  
 

 
S o ,  a n ywa y,  t
hey tookus out of thisplace because it was 
m obbed with people.T hey put us in open cattle carsfor a short tripfurther. Unimaginably 

cruel
,  
because it snowed on us and the windwhipped in. W e werefreezing.  Our
 
m ouths were 
so dry f rom  dehydration.  You know, 
if
 
it snowed,everybody openedtheir mouth to the sky to 
catchany of  it. My aunt, Pearl, the train stoppedatone point. These were steam  engines.  

T he engine was beingf illed with water f or running thetrain. W eheard this gushing of water.  

W e were sodehydrated.  She stood up with a cupand dangled it out of  theopen cattle car 

yellin g, you know, water.  There was a guard
 
--
 
there was a guard with a gun and adog in 
each cattle car. And this guard, a wom an guard, she got up and began to beather, vicious
ly
 
beat herdown to the ground.  Made her head bleed.  Just pouncedon her cruelly.

W e didn't get the water.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you would end up at a cam p called Neustadt
-
Glewe.  T hat wouldbe the 
last cam p,I believe.  I know we're going to wr ap up soon, but if  youcan bear with us,folks.  
 
 
T ell us about your two aunts, you and Sere
na.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Weendedup in the sm all cam p.  Again, theovercro wding and the 

chaosand the lackof even the kindof  rations or assistance that we had elsewhere hadbroken 

down.  Inthis cam p we actually starved.  T here were no rations. There
 
was practically 
nothing.  And inaddition tothat, becauseof  the heavy cro wding, we becametremendously 

infested with lice.  Andthat led to 
T y
phoid, T
yphus.  People began to die f rom that. 
 
 
W e were on thef loor. Always on thef loor.There were no 
bar
racks, noteven thebunktype of things we hadat some other places.  My Aunt Pearl 
b e cam e  sick w
ithT yphus and was delirious,fell on thef loor.  People were stepping over her.  
She was bum ping intopeople andnot knowing where she was because of the high
 
fe ve r.  W e 
decided to put her in this sm all inf irmary thatwas on the prem ises. At least she had a bunk to 

lie on. Serenaand I kept going, looking in the window. W e couldn't enter it.  She would 

m otion, come to the wi ndow and indicate to us that she was getting better.  But one day a truck 

arrived, and we saw all the sickpeoplef rom the inf irm ary being loaded on
to the  tru ck, 

including m y Aunt Pearl.  So we became aware of  what this meant. T hey didn'thave a killing 

facility in this place, sothey sentthe truck to collect the sick and take them  to where there was 

a 
killing f acility, which was Ravensbruck.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you knew that's what happened?
 
>> IreneW eiss: W e knew that's what happened. T hey took her, wi thm any others.  And, of

co u rse
, shenever came back.
 
 
Laterm y other Aunt, Rose,also becam efeverish, ver y high 
fever, again on thef loor.  And, again, being tram pledand soon. Although we knew what was 
going on atthe inf irm ary, we hadno choice.W ithher perm ission, we put her in
to  th at little  

inf irm ary.  But we were vi gilant, Serena andIwere watching for the trucks.
 
 
T hey didn'tdo anything for the sick there.  Itwas just a better 
place to be off thef loor.
  
So we snatchedherout in afew days, justbrought her back to where 
we were on thef loor. Somehow her fever broke,and she pulled through.
 
 
During this chaotic time, asI say, the selection continued. I 
m ean,herethe war was practically upon us,the Germ an Arm y.  The Germanshad theirhands 

f u ll.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmean the Soviets were alm ost there?
 
>> IreneW eiss: T he Soviets were alm ost there.  And yet they hadthe organizationenough to 

com e and continue the killing and select people. 
 
 
Oneday we were outdoors being counted. That,too, was a 
routinethat was a torturous experience because we would be thrown outearly in them orning, 

wait f or hours to be counted. Soduring this counting, selections continued
, 
because they 
could takea good look at people. 
 
 
Serena was ver y, ver y, ver y run down, very th in, em aciated.  
W e had pretty much full
-
f ledge starving here.  So they pulled herout in the selection.  I said to 
the Germandoing that
 
--
 
I said," I am her sister."  
  
H
e said, "ok, youcan go, too."  
S
o they 
lockedus in a room , waiting for the truckto com e with m
any others who looked like us.  I was 
so terrif iedof being alone withoutm y sister and m y aunt being very s ick andm ay notm ake it.

Again, the terror of being alone, I supposebecauseI was 13, seem ed tobe so m uch stronger 
in  m e tha n  in m y siste r.  I co
uldnotabide, imagine, the possibility of fendingf orm yself  inthis 
situation.  It was not possible.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you were going to go wherever she went.
 
>> IreneW eiss: W eboth knew where we we re going.  I knew.  Butrather than staying alone, I
 
wanted to go with her.  They saidf ine.
 
 
So we were locked in this room  and waiting for thetruck.  
Because of the chaosof the war approaching, the truck didn'tarrive.  Soby the endof  theday 

som ebody pushed thedoor, and it gave.  And one by one we sort of sneaked out and went 

back to our original barrack and nobody seemed to notice. The confusion was quite large.
 
 
So because the truck didn't arrive, we had this chance to 
survi ve. W e headed back toour room
, 
where m y aunt was still, andtheothers. 
 
T he y a ll 
started, you know, yelli ng " the children areback."
 
>> Bill Benson:  Meaning you andSerena. 
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. Even that was strangebecause nobody ever called us children. T hat 

was ver y dangerous to do.  Childrenhad to die.  Jewish children had to die. Andthey didby 

them illions. They wer e subject to the genocide thatthe Germ ans perpetratedagainst the 

Jews.  So their plan was to kill the young. There will not be another generation.  A
n d  k ill th e ir 
m others with them , r
educing the di
sturbance thatm ight cause to separate them . Besides the 
young wom en who wil l  not b
ear
 
children.  You kill the old andthe sick that you have no use for 
a
nd youuseup the young adults in slave labor, and soon they'll all be gone and genocidewi ll 
be com plete.  Keepthat upfor several years.  It was,
 
I m u st sa y,  ve r y su cce ssf u l,  b
ecause by 
the end
,  
they m anaged to kill 
s ix
 
m illion, either in gas cham bers or outright, you know, using

them  up inhard labor, starvation
,  
andm istreatm ent or shooting.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  So
,  
am a zi n gl y
,  
because of the trucknot showing, you were able to walk out 
and you, your sister, and your Aunt Rose were able to survi ve and liberation cam e shortly af ter 
th a t.
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Yes. And liberation cam e shortly af terthat.  Yes. So by this time
, 
we had 
been at thisplaceen route and inthis placeforf ive m onths, whichwas an incredibly diff icult 

placebecause we wer e starving.  Not hungry but starving.  So when f inally 
--
 
the Russian f ront 
and Russian Arm y did approach the area,
 
the German guards disappearedf rom  their guard 
towers and cautiously watched to see if  thatwas f or realor whether they will com e back.  

Nobody moved.  Nobody lef tthe place.  Nobody tried to open the gate.  Because we were 

unsureof  the situation.  W eheard war noises.  But mainly we f elt that we weren't sure that 

they're not com ing back.
 
 
So oneday somebody tried the gate, and it was opened.W e 
never did see the Russian soldiers. T hey remained in the towns nearby.  We remaineduntil 

cautiously we exited through the gateand thenfound a town by thever y sam e name as our 

cam p, Neustadt
-
Glewe.  Put m y Aunt Rose into the hospitalthere because she was very, very 
sick. W estayed.W edidn't leave. W e waitedf or her.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Irene, we're going to close the program  in justam om ent. Obviously
,  
we just 
scratched the surf ace
,  
and we could spend, you know, the rest of the day and beyond hearing 
aboutm orethat Irenewould share with us, including all that happenedf rom that pointforward 

that we don't gettohear about.W hen we f inish in a moment, because we didn'thave timefor 

questions andanswers, Irene is going to stepoff  the stage over here, and if  any of  you want to 

com e up andm eet her, ask a question, whatever, pleasefeelf ree todo that
.

the last word.  So I will turn back to Irene to close theprogram .
 
>> IreneW eiss:  Ok. So we have heard it said that the only thing necessary for evil to trium ph 
is for goodpeople to do nothing.  So how can we avoid becom ing bystanders in our time? 
 
W ehave to recognize hate speechand propaganda when it startsand rem ember where itcan 

lead if  good people look away and don't speak out.
