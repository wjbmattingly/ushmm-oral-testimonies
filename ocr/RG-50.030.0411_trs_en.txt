They cared a lot for us, and we we
re all, we were very happy then.

Q: Do you remember the character of your fath
er, what your father wa
s like and what your 
relationship was like?  We re you very close with him?  
 
A: My father was an educated ma n. He was - he
 didn™t mi x into our lives, into the kids. My 
mother took complete charge of us. She was like our friend. She was always interested in 
every aspect of our lives, and we responded to her that way. 
 
Q: And was your father sort of a distant father?  
 
A: He wasn™t a distant father, but
 he didn™t mi x into our upbringing. 
 
Q: So, did you have private time with your fa
ther or primarily private time with your 
mother?  
 
A: Ratherwithmymother. 
 
Q: And, since you were the eldest child, what was your re
lationship with your two younger 
sisters?  One was two years younger then you a
nd the other is, what, five years younger?  
 
A: Yes, five.  
 
Q: So, were you close with them?  
 
A: Well, I was close with them, but they sa
y, I don™t reme mber this, but they say I was 
bossy. 
 
Q: You were bossy?  
 
A: That I was bossing them around, but we loved 
each other. We  were always - we never 
had any fights unless it™s true what 
they say that I was bossing them around. 
 
Q: Do you remember - Chris said that you ha
d - you all had to have collars for school?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Cleancollars? 
 
A: Cleancollars. 
 
Q: So, they had to be washed and then sewn on every day, right? 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

A: Yes, but that was when I was at school in
 Radom. I had a girlfriend, and since I was good 
at writing essays and stuff like that, I was writing her essays and she was washing my 
collars for me, and attaching them to whatever I wore. 
 
Q: Now, Chris reme mbers you asking 
her to do that for her before. 
 
A: That™s very possible. I don™
t reme mber, but it™s possible. He
r things were always neatly 
hung up in the closet. I reme mber, we had a shel
f together. My mother divided it, and she 
says, ﬁYou will have one side, and Chris will ha ve the ot her side.ﬂ Hers was always 
neatly put together, and mi ne
 was a mi sh- mash. So, I reme mber my mother says, ﬁWhy 
can™t you keep it like your sister
?ﬂ I said, ﬁShe has a better si
de.ﬂ So, Krysia says, ﬁOkay, 
I™ll give you my side.ﬂ And soon enough, this si
de was all neatly put together and mi ne 
was all messy. 
 
Q: [Laughs.] What did you like
 to study? Did you like studying? 
 
A: I was a very good student. My mother - my mo
ther calls me a genius, and I believed her. 
[Laughs.] 
 
Q: Well, your sisters call 
you a genius too, you know?  
 
A: That™s - my mother was very proud of me  because I was very well brought up, like I had 
very nice manners and since I was a little assi
mi lated and I had a lot of Polish girlfriends, 
usually the Polish parents did not like the Data
strassas (ph) , the Jews, but since I was so 
well brought up and polite at all time , and I wa
s helping them with school, I was always 
welcome to their homes, and to me, at
 that time , it was very important.  
 
Q: Why was it so important?  
 
A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a 
Jew that I felt that - I just wa
nted - at that time, when I wa
s a kid - don™t forget, that that 
was at the time  when I was nine, eight, ten, youknow - I wanted to be one of them a t  that 

time. 
 
Q: So, explain how to me  persecuted as a Jew?
 What was it like for you as a Jewish child? 
 
A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we 
had - in our town, there was a lot of religious 
Jews. Most of the Jewish people that lived in
 Wi erzbnik were religi
ous, and I always saw 
Polacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that  it was ridi culing them, 
and so - I, personally, since I was just a child 
at the time, I didn™t feel it, and being with 
the Polish girls, you know, associating with 
them, I didn™t feel it, but I saw it on the 
outside, and that™s why ma ybe I wa nted to be one of them. 
 
Q: Did you yourself feel uncomforta
ble with the very Orthodox Jews?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

A: To a point, because they - they coul dn™t 
speak Polish. I mean, they spoke Polish with an 
accent. They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and be ing so very 
religious, they had a certain ma nnerism that
 distinguished them for the other people. 
They were dressed differentl
y. They acted differently. They spoke differently. So, but I 
identifi ed with them, but sometimes I felt 
a little bit uncomfortable with them.  
 
Q: Do you remember what the population of Starachowice was?  
 
A: Yes, it was - Wi erzbnik-Starac
howice were like twin cities, 
if you can call that that. That 
total population was 35,000, and ten percent of 
it were Jewish people like between 3,200 
to 3,500. And, most of them lived in Wi erzbnik; some  Poles lived in Wi erzbnik, too. 
Starachowice was mostly - in Starachowice, there were mostly - not mostly, I would say 
almost 95 percent Poles. They worked there 
because we had the munition factory there. 
They worked there and they lived there. Some
 of them lived in Wi erzbnik, too, but all 
Jews lived in Wi erzbnik.  
 
Q: Youleft?  
 
A: I left. My mother sent me to schoo
l in Radom when I was eleven years old. 
 
Q: Was that an ordinary th
ing?  Why did that happen?  
 
A: No, because I was a good stude
nt and we had what they call 
Gymnasium,
 which was a 
high school in Starachowice, but 
it wasn™t one of the best. 
In Radom, there was - there 
was one of the best girls™ school, but it was al
mo st impossible to get in for the Jews. At 
first, we had 
numerus klausus
 (ph), which meant one Jewish 
girl for 45 students in a class 
would be accepted, and then 
in the later years it was 
numerus nolus
 ( p h) , whi c h me a n s  
none of the Jewish girls could be accept
ed. So, I was lucky. You have to pass a 
competitive exam, and you had to really be ve ry, very good to be accepted. So, my 
mother tried - she sent  me there and I passe
d the exam, and at the end of the year, she 
found out that I was accepted. So, for her itwas the biggest achievement that she could 

ever achieve at the time which 
- and I went to that school 
there and I lived on my own. 
Like, I had relatives, but my mother placed me
 in a - like she rented a room, with like 
there were ki ds there my  age. So, she rented
 a room with a family, and that™s where I 
stayed. 
 
Q: Did that scare you to go away?  
 
A: At first it did. As a ma tter of fact, I crie
d for a long time before I went there, and when I 
found myself there, I also felt a little bit st
range, but soon I got used to it, and I got to 
know all the people my age and a year older or
 a year younger, because they were seve ral 
schools in Ra dom. It wa s a big city with 100,000 
people there. They had several different 
schools. They even had a Jewish high school
, called Pzhiachu Wi erze (ph), which me ant 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

ﬁfriends of knowledgeﬂ, if I were to translat
e it exactly. So, there 
were a lot of Jewish 
kids that were educated in Starachowice, 
Wi erzbnik. The religious people didn™t send the 
girls to high school because of
 the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat. You 
know, because we had six days of school. So, 
the parents woul dn™t let them do that. So, 
they had a lot of other schools that were c
onnected with the religious moveme nt. But  in 
Radom, the parents were a littl
e bit - I mean, it was a bigger 
city, and there was a lot of 
young people that were going to those differe
nt schools, and the schools were much 
better than in Wi erzbnik. 
 
Q: Was it kind of exciting to 
be in a mu ch larger city? 
 
A: Well, once I got to know the people my age,
 I felt very good there. As a matter of fact, 
until today, I have a lot of friends from Ra
dom. And, as a matter of fact, my husband 
ma de a party for them a ll like at the cottage 
a year before he died. 
There was fifty of us. 
 
Q: Really. And, what we
re your favorite subjects?  
 
A: At the time , languages and ma thema tics. 
 
Q: Mathematics? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did that come  from your fa
ther since he was an engineer?  
 
A: Yes, that™s true. [Laughs.] It was -talki
ng about home , when he 
counted, he counted in 
German, bec a use he was educated in German. 
I count - no ma tter what language I speak - 
if I have to count, I count in Polish. My 
husband, no ma tter what language he spoke, he 
would count in Yiddish. And since 
you are talking about languages–. 
 
Q: How do you account for that?  
 
A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - 
we spoke Polish at home . So, I was used to 
speaking Polish all the time, and bec a use I suppo
se that I got used to counting. I think it™s 
very normal. 
 
Q: Did you write home a great deal?  
 
A: Well, I did write home. Every week my 
mother would send me  home-baking and stuff 
like that, a parcel, and then, whoever would 
travel to Radom, she would send some thing 

for me . So, when this person came I wrote a 
letter to my parents. We  didn™t have a 
telephone at all. 
 
Q: Did you write to your sisters?
 Or does the one letter count? 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
6 
 
 
A: Oneletter. 
 
Q: Did they write to you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No?  
 
A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy 
da y, I went ho me . As a matter of fact, the 
month of Se ptember, since Radom was about 
sixty kilometers away from Wi erzbnik, it 
was a two hour ride on the train because I ha
d to change trains half way. So, at the 
beginning, I didn™t want  to go back to Radombecause when I was at home  it felt so good 
to be at home. So, the first month, I wa
s traveling every day to Radom and back. 
 
Q: Everyday?  
 
A: Every day to get home. But th
en, then later when the days b
ecame  shorter, I stayed there. 
But I had a very, very good life in Ra dom becau
se, as a say, I had lots of friends there. 
 
Q: Do you remember the Paliszewskis? 
 
A: Yes, I remember them very well. 
 
Q: Were you close to them also?  
 
A: Very close. Those were the 
Polish friends of my parents, 
and we were very close. The 
father was - I mean, we c a lled him a doctor. He
 didn™t have an education, but he, I mean, 
ma ybe he wasn™t a doctor really, but he wa
s acting as a doctor. 
And there were four 
daughters there and they opene
d, how should I say, a school. Since the age of two or so, 
we went to that school. It was like a - I 
don™t know whether to call it a kindergarten or 
whatever. And they taught us - they taught us 
to such a degree that when I went to public 
school, the transferred me immediately the 
first da y because I could read and write 
already, and then I skipped again, because they
 were very good teac
hers and they were 
very good friends of our parents. We  went 
there for Christma s and I enjoyed so much 
seeing the Christma s tree and she had home  bake
d cookies on the tree. We  really liked it, 
and they were very, very good friends of our 
parents. As a ma tter of fact, they kept 
certain things for us, like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned 

our valuables after the war because I also ha
d - we  also had friends, they were also 
teachers, that we left some  clothes and st
uff like this, and when we came back, they 
wouldn™t give us anything. Not only that they 
wouldn™t give us anyt
hing, but they said, 
ﬁIf you are need, go to the Jewish congress.ﬂ So, the Paliszewskis were very, very 
exceptional. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

Q: So, in your experience with Polish Cat
holics, that™s an unus
ual experience, the 
Paliszewskis, the way they were with you?  
 
A: Very unusual, but they weren™t - ma ybe th
ey were, but I thought they came  from the 
Russian side so ma ybe they were, whatever– 
 
Q: GreekOrthodox?  
 
A: Greek Orthodox, I™m not sure, ma ybe not, but
 Christma s was Christma s, so ma ybe they 
weren™t, but they spoke with a Russian accen
t. They weren™t born in Wi erzbnik; they 
came from the Russian si de. 
 
Q: Were there other Polish Cat
holic friends that you had, that 
you were that close with or 
not?  
 
A: I had a girlfriend, the doctor™s daughter. 
Her name was Helena Lambaska. She had, her 
parents were -  in addition that he was a doctor, he was also such a Polish aristocrat, and I 
reme mber them. She was a very good friend 
of mi ne right through 
school, right through 
the public school and then in Radom, as well. And I reme mbe r  when she came  to us, she 

rode a horse and I was envious, 
but I was afraid of the horse. 
 
Q: So, you never got on the horse?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No, did she ever ask you to try? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you remember your dog?  
 
A: Dog, yes, I think we had a dog called ﬁLadyﬂ, 
but I was mostly, at this time I was away 
from home, but I remember it being there. 
 
Q: So, you left to go to Radom in ™33 or ™34?  
 
A: No,™35. 
 
Q: ™35, so you were twelve?  No, you were eleven. 
 
A: Eleven. 
 
Q: You were eleven. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
8 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So, even though you™re still a kid, do you begi
n to hear things about
 what™s happening in 
Germany, or  is that not very conscious yet?  
 
A: Not conscious until - as a matter of fact, I had no idea. I mean, fi rst of all, we knew what 
was happening in Germa ny, but we - I, myself, 
be lieved that Poland is so strong that we  
are not going to be afraid of the Germans. 
What should I say?  I really believed that 
Poland was one of the, how should I say 
it, the strongest countries in Europe. 
 
Q: So, you had no idea what sort of an army they really had. 
 
A: Noidea. 
 
Q: So, you had no fear?  
 
A: Nofear. 
 
Q: None. But, you were conscious in some  
way about what was happening in Germany?  
 
A: I was conscious, but I didn™t believe it. Like
, my father, who was educated in Germany - 
not in Germany, in Austria, I think, but he
 said the German people are so good, that 
nothing - I mean, not to worry about it. That
, you know, like, that™s what he believed 
because he hi mself was brought up in a different atmosphere at the time. 
 
Q: So, a couple of years later, in ™37-™38, befo
re the war begins and there are German Jews 
whose ancestors came from Poland, who are sent
 back to Poland and come into the area 
of Starachowice, right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So, do you see these people when you come  
back on vacation?  Do you notice that there 
are these German Jews who have been sent away? 
 
A: But, there we ren™t too ma ny yet in Wi erzbni
k or Starachowice, but they mi ght have gone 
to other cities. I don™
t reme mber any German pe ople. Mind you, when I came home , my 
mother used to send me  to different aunts on 
vacation, and they all - 
since I was used not 
to being at home and my  moth
er felt that my sisters had it
 better because they were at 
home  and I was away., so when I came  home
 she would send me  to a relative for the 
vacation in another part of Poland. So, Ireally was very little in Wi erzbnik. 
 
Q: Tell me  - I want to go back a little bit. Te
ll me  about your grandma. You all seem to have 
had an extremely close relationship. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
9 
 
A: Very close relationship. She lived about - I 
don™t reme mber. It would be about 20 or 30 
kilometers from Wi erzbnik. The place was cal
led Ostrowiec. We  ha
d three aunts and a 
grandmother that we were very close with 
them. The aunts were very nice wome n. They 
were running my grandmother™s business, 
and the youngest one was going to university, 
and she finished pharmacy. We  were very clos
e with this grandmot
her. I was going there 
very often, and I developed like a friendship w
ith ma ny kids my age there, and I like to 
go to Ostrowiec, and my grandma liked us to
 come to visit her all the time. She was a 
very - she really loved us. 
 
Q: Did she teach you a
bout Jewish prayers?  
 
A: Yes, she was very religious, extremely re
ligious. My grandfather was - I would say, he 
was wearing the clot hes that the religious Je
ws wore. And I reme mber that on her stove, 
she had a wooden kind of a board that would di
vide the milk dishes, if she cooked milk 
dishes, and the other dishes on the same  stove. She had this board so the vapor shouldn™t 
mi x with the other. My mother was Kosher
, because otherwise my grandmother would 
never eat when she would come  to the house. But we were more traditional and my 
mother and father were very much involved in the Zionist mo veme nt. So, they were 
working for Israel  all the time. 
 
Q: You ma y not reme mber this or even know 
this. Was your mother 
in conflict with her 
mother because she wasn™t as religious? 
 
A: Never, no. As a ma tter of fact, she was very
 mu ch loved by her mother and grandfather, I 
was told. The grandfather was so religious, 
and his sons - I don™t know whether Renia 
told you that his sons turned to be Comm
unist. They had to run away because the 
grandfather wouldn™t accept them. Then he 
sat Shiva after them because he was so 
religious and they were Comm
unists. So, how could that be
 reconciled?But my mot her, 
regardless of what she was, she wa
s very much loved by her fa mily. 
 
Q: So, was it odd for you to learn this much a
bout - did she expect that you would become  
religious?  Was that her hope?  
 
A: Mymother? 
 
Q: No, your grandma. 
 
A: No,no. 
 
Q: She just wanted you to know?  
 
A: Yes, right, and as far as my mother is c
oncerned, I reme mber she brought in a teacher and 
she opened - because the Zionists had an or
ganization, we had a room there - so, my 
mother was instrume ntal in bringing a Hebrew 
teacher. He lived in our house at first. He 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
10 
 
was like, you know, they couldn™t pay him muc
h, and she opened the Ta rbut school, and 
we were learning the modern Hebrew. 
 
Q: So, your mo ther opened the Tarbut school?  
 
A: My mother opened it. 
 
Q: And there were a lot of children who went?  
 
A: I would say there was about twenty percen
t of families that weren™t or thodox, so they 
would send the kids there. 
 
Q: Because, of course, the or thodox would not go. 
 
A: No, they had their own school called Bysiarke
v (ph) for the girls, and for the boys they 
were studying at the schribus (ph) and the synagogue - the religious ones. 
 
Q: I think we ma y be close to the end of the tape, but I™m not exactly sure. Four mi nutes, 
okay. Did you graduate from high 
school before the war began?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How ma ny years was high school?  
 
A: High school and lycée, we  had 
both. Like before the war, I fi
nished four years of high 
school, and after the war, I went back to hi
gh school, and then I we
nt to university in 
Poland, what they call Cultural Diplomatic school. 
 
Q: So, as you™re going to high school, so be
tween ™35 and September of ™39, right, do you 
feel things getting difficult, or are yo
u still believing, ﬁGerma ny™s not going to do 
anything.ﬂ 
 
A: No, Ger many will not do anyt
hing. I still believed it, because 
at school they let us believe 
that Poland is very strong.  
 
Q: So, you don™t live with any fear. 
 
A: Nofear. 
 
Q: So, war must have come  as a complete shock to you. 
 
A: Complete shock to us and when we had to run away from home because they were 
bombing the factories in Starac
howice, and we had to run away
 to different villages to 
just not be - but, Poland was taken in a few 
days. So, soon after the Germans came in - I 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
11 
 
wasn™t afraid of them at the 
beginning - but soon I learned that we have to be afraid of 
them. 
 
Q: Okay, let™s st op the tape
 and change it please.  
 
End of Tape #1

Tape #2
 
 
Q: Hania, what happened when the war 
began?  You were in Radom at school. 
 
A: No, I was at home. I came home for the vacat
ion in June, and I stayed at home , and the 
war broke out on September the 1
st
. As I said, we  had to run away. We  ran away to 
whatever close village. We stayed with so
me  farmers, and when Poland was taken by the 
Germans, which was in a few days, we were sent home. 
 
Q: Was that a ve ry frightening experience the evacuation?  
 
A: It was very fr ightening because we did 
- war was something strange to us. We didn™t 
know what war means, but we when we heard the bombs flying and when we heard that 
people got killed, we got scared. But when we returned home and the Germans ca me  i n, 
they walked with dogs. We were afraid of th
em, and we were told like when we were 
walking on the same  sidewalk, we had to go 
off the sidewalk when the Germans were 

walking through. So, at first we
 laughed that they are so 
proud, they are so stupid, but 
then later we  started getting scared. 
 
Q: Do you happen to reme mber the first night
 you came  back aft e r you had been evacuated 
and you had a very formal kind of dinner, that your father wanted there to be a tablecloth 
on the table? Do you remember that? 
 
A: No, I don™t. 
 
Q: So, what is your first me mory after you come
 ba ck from the bombardme nt?  What is the 
clearest me mory that you have of how life changes for you?  
 
A: That we were afraid, but my
 father assured us that the so
ldiers and the governme nt is bad, 
but the German people are straightforward, goo
d people, that not to be afraid of the 
civilians, just  the soldiers. But they were like
, there were soldiers al
l over, only soldiers. I 
was afraid of them, but we just stayed away
 from them as much as we could. So, we 
didn™t pay very much attention to them. Like
, we did, but when we came home, at first, 
like in 1939, there were things happening, but not
 - we weren™t really 
afraid. I wasn™t, at 
least.  
 
Q: Do you remember whether your sisters were afraid?  Do you reme mber talking with 
them? 
 
A: I don™t remember this part 
of my life really that much. 
 
Q: Let me  ask you this: you move about three time s. 
 
A: Right.

Q: Between the first evacuation, when you come  
bac k to your apartment, until the ghetto is 
closed. 
 
A: Yes, first they moved - we lived on the ma in 
street, so, first of all, we were moved away 
from the ma in streets, and the ghetto was a 
little bit bigger, and then they squeezed us. 
We had to move because the pl ace where we we
re, they mo ved us again a little bit closer 
to the original ghetto. So, we moved 
three times. I reme mber all those. 
 
Q: You reme mber all those moves?  
 
A: Moves,yes. 
 
Q: Now, was that - what did you think wh
en that was happening?  Do you know how–?  
 
A: You know, like, when I think of it now, I 
didn™t have any idea that it™s going - that it 
could be so bad. Like, we didn™t really 
- we didn™t know what was going on around us, 
like in Wa rsaw. We  heard it, but we didn™t want
 to believe it, to believe in it. But we 
were more scared then than at the beginning, 
because at the beginning 
we lived a little bit 
more norma l, but now we had to watch ever
y move that we ma de because we™re not 
allowed to get out of the ghetto. We  were w
earing those - we wearing the armband with 
the Jewish star in it, and if they catchyou outside of the ghetto, they would kill you. I 
heard that. I had a case where I was very foo
lish. I had a boyfriend at the time  who lived 
in Busko Zdroj. It was - but that was around 
™41 already, and the parents invited me  to 
come  there, and Jews weren™t allowed to trav
el. So, they had hotels 
there. It was a plac e 
like where they had cures for arthritis and 
they owned hotels there. The Ge rmans took 
away their hotels, but they worked there as wo
rkers. So, they send me  a work order that I 
was supposed to work in the hotel. That was ju
st - it was just for the purpose of me  being 
able to go, to travel. So, I reme mber I went 
to Kielce, which was a place where the train 
stopped, and like when I say stopped, the train 
line stopped and there we
re buses going to 
Busko, and I couldn™t get on this train. I c
ouldn™t get on the bus because they sent the 
Jews to the very end, and I was wearing this 
band, and the Jews to the very end. So, I was 
waiting the whole day there, and all the time , th
e Jews to the very end, I had to stay in 
line. So, I decided - I didn™t have any fear at
 the time  - I decided to just hitchhike to 
Busko, because I figured I couldn™t do anythi
ng else. So, what did I do?  I took off my 
band, put it in my purse, and then I stood on 
the corner and a car stopped and it was a 
guy, a German-speaking guy. He asked me  if I 
would like a lift, and I said, ﬁYeah.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁWhere are you going? ﬂ I said, ﬁTo Busko.ﬂ
 So, he says, ﬁGet in.ﬂ So, I get in, and 
he started speaking to me . He asked me  - I 
didn™t know who he was. I had no idea. It was 
a German. I was scared to death. That™s the 
first time  I was scared, but I was already 
sitting there. So, he started asking me  wher
e am I going. I said, ﬁI go there.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁFor what? ﬂ I said, ﬁI™ve got 
a job there.ﬂ ﬁWhat™s your name
? ﬂ  So, of course, I gave a 
Polish name  because I was afraid Laks was a Je
wish name . I couldn™t say that my name  is 
so and so. So, anyway, what he was, he 
was like a troihinder (ph) of the Jewish 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
14 
 
businesses. What it meant - the Germans took away the Jewish businesses, and he was 
like - he was checking on all those businesse
s, and among others, he was checking on this 
fa mily that I was going to. So, I told him that
 I™m going to work there, and that was okay. 
So, he stopped in a place called Miernic (ph)
 because he had some  business to do there. 
So, he asked me to sit in th
e car and he would take me  because he was going to Busko. 
So, a Polish guy - in each city they ha d a Po
lish supervisor , in each town and city like on 
his way because he was the ma in one. He was in charge of it, but the Polacks were 
supervising those Jewish businesses. The Po
lack recognized me  that I was Jewish. He 
recognized me . He didn™t tell me  anything, 
although I spoke Polish perfectly, and I 
thought I didn™t look Jewish. He recognized that I was Jewish. So, when the guy came  
back, I noticed that he went and he told him, 
and this fellow - he was so nice to me  all the 
way - he came  and he s a ys, ﬁ
Bist du eiben
? ﬂ  So, I said, ﬁYah.ﬂ So, he screamed - do you 
understand what that means, ﬁ
Bist du eiben
.ﬂ - ﬁAre you Jewish? ﬂ  
So, I said, ﬁYes.ﬂ So, 
he said, ﬁ
Wo hast du die Armband
? ﬂ  That means, ﬁ Where is your band? ﬂ  So, I was stupid 
- at that time I was crystal clear like as far,
 I was so idealistic. I 
never lied, and I was so 
well brought up. So, I took my purse, and I took it
 out and showed it to him. He took me  
by the collar, threw my out, threw my  suitcase.
 The suitcase fell apart,
 and he took - it™s a 
good thing he  didn™t kill me  because he 
could have . He was so embarrassed, you know, 
in front of the Polack, the Polish supervisor th
at he didn™t know what to do. So, he ran to 
the car so fast, and then the Polish guy comes to me  and says , ﬁDo you have anywhere to 
go in Miernic?ﬂ So, I said to him, ﬁAs a ma tte
r of fact I do. I know 
a doctor here, and his 
name  is Dr. Reichman.ﬂ And I reme mber and he
 says, ﬁI can take you.ﬂ So, he carried my 
suitcase. He carried my suitcase to Dr. Reichm
an there. He wasn™t even embarrassed. He 
caused all the trouble, because othe rwise I wouldn™t have had any trouble. I™m telling you 
only how - not only that I was 
idealistic, but I was so naïve,
 and I™ll tell y
ou, stupid to a 
certain point because, I mean, I didn™t do anyt
hing wrong. I just took a–hitchhiked. So, I 
don™t know what I was referring to when 
I told you the story when you asked me . 
 
Q: It™s every interesting. First of all, the 
Germans could not recognize who was Jewish and 
who was not; only the Poles could. 
 
A: The Poles could, and I ne ver - be lieve me
, by accident, I don™t know how he knew that I 
was Jewish, and then I had to call my boyfrie
nd from this doctor™s place, that I™m here 
and he worked for the Germans as a chauffer at the time. He was a me dical student, but 
he was working for the Germans as a chauffer,
 so the German - his boss of hi m ca me  to 
pick me  up, and then from that time on, I was ju
st sitting there. I wa
s afraid that, because 
he knew what I was, I thought he would come  and kill me . But, that™s how I trusted 

people. 
 
Q: Did this Polish guy tell you why he told the German guy?  
 
A: I never told him. I never asked him, but 
I thought that it was - lik
e, it was almost cruel 
because, I mean, the Germans, they all carrie
d guns with them, and if he could kill me, 
nobody would ask questions. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

Q: Were you surprised that the German guy didn™
t ask for your identification, because all of 
you had to carry identification? 
 
A: No, we did, and I did, and I had a letter wh
ere I™m going to work. I 
wasn™t going to work, 
as I told you, and he never asked me . I™ll tell you, whenever I™m late from that time on, 
whenever I me t a Ger man, I pretended that 
I don™t understand German. I thought that was 
the best - that was the best, if I couldn™
t - if I don™t understand. I always said, ﬁNo.ﬂ 
 
Q: Why?  Why did you think that was the best way?  
 
A: Because I figured that  if speak German we
ll, he will ask me  more questions. This way 
they won™t ask any questions. 
 
Q: And you being so honest. 
 
A: I was so straightforward, my fath
er used to that he didn™t like it. 
 
Q: So, did you go to work at this place? 
 
A: No, I never. 
 
Q: You never got there. 
 
A: No, I did get there, but this
 letter and the request for work 
was only for me  to be able to 
travel, because otherwise I couldn™t ge t out, being Jewish, I couldn™t ge t out of the ghetto. 

But if I got a permit to work some where, I was allowed to - of course, I had to wear my 
band - but I did wear my  band until I couldn™t 
get on the bus, and if I stayed in Kielce, 
there was no place I could go anywhere, and I wa
sn™t sure whether the next bus will take  
me .  
 
Q: And, the armband that you wore was white?  
 
A: White with the Jewish star, but at the time, when I went hitchhiking, I didn™t wear the 
band. 
 
Q: What ma de–?  You weren™t 
afraid to take it off? 
 
A: I wasn™t afraid because I knew that 
I looked Polish. I have 
no accent that would nobody 
would recognize me . I was told so ma ny times 
in my lifetime  that I don™t look Jewish that 
I believed it. I just told him a false name . Like
, he  asked me  what my na me was, so, I told 
him Lisows ka, or whatever was a Polish na
me, the first name that came to my mi nd. 
 
Q: Did you speak German with him, this guy?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
16 
 
 
A: I spoke German with him, like, to a poi
nt, but I did speak Ge rman because he didn™t 
speak Polish. 
 
Q: He was really embarrassed because he  didn™t figure it out. 
 
A: If you knew how he screamed at me  when he 
threw me  out of this car. He  just took me  by 
my collar and just threw me . He was so emba
rrassed. He wouldn™t have done that if the 
Polack wouldn™t look at it. I don
™t think so. Maybe I™m wrong. 
 
Q: When did you start dating?  
 
A: I was, like, shortly before the war, when I was fifteen. 
 
Q: Yeah, was that sort of 
a typical time  for young girls?  
 
A: Yeah, but when you say dating, it wasn™t dating. We went in groups
. We  never went one 
by one. Like, we me t - we were going to movi
es together. So, there 
was a whole group of 
boys and girls, and of course, I had my favor
ite, or he had his favorite, but we were going 
always together, not by ourselves. 
 
Q: And did you like going to the movies?  
 
A: Yeah, I loved it. 
 
Q: Any particular favorites? 
 
A: The old movies, 
Jeannette MacDonald
 and all those, the musicals. It  was really like - 
every student was going at least once a week
 to the movies, at least once a week. 
 
Q: These were American movies that you saw? 
 
A: American movies, yeah, 
we didn™t have any others. 
 
Q: I think it sort of surp
rises people to think about 
people going to those movies. 
 
A: Yeah, but we had subtitles. 
 
Q: InPolish?  
 
A: InPolish 
 
Q: So, Jeanette MacDonald singing. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
17 
 
A: Singing with - that was one 
of my most favoritemovies. He
r movies were - and Shirley 
Temple, of course, at the time, because she was so cute.  
 
Q: Did they show you dramatic movies as we
ll and mysteries or was it mainly the musicals 
that came  over?  
 
A: No, there were different movies. As a ma tter 
of fact at that time, we were collecting the 
movie stars photos and we were exchanging 
them. This was like a treasure. We  were 
buying all those photos and putting them into an
 album, and then if - because they were 
quite expensive those photos 
- so if you had some  doubles 
or if you didn™t like some , you 
could always exchange it with some one 
else because everybody had an album and 
photos. 
 
Q: Was this boys and girls? 
 
A: Yeah,both. 
 
Q: Both, and where would you buy - how would they selling them?  
 
A: I don™t remember, really I don™t remember. 
We  often, when we get together, we often 
talk about the, the albums that we had. 
 
Q: Because when I was a kid, people used to buy them, and they were in candy or bubble 
gum or something. 
 
A: I had no idea where we got them, but we had to buy them like– 
 
Q: I understand that, once there was no schooli
ng for Jewish kids, that you became a teacher 
in your house. 
 
A: Oh, that was during the war. 
 
Q: Right, that™s what I mean. 
 
A: That was during - school™s finished for us. Th
e war finished, like, we were not allowed to 
go to any schools. So, there was nothing else
 to do, and the people thought that I was 
intelligent, that I was smart, that I was goi
ng to Ra dom to school. It was a myth really. 
So, the parents started comi ng and asking whether I could give them lessons. So, I had 
two sisters. So, I figured I™l
l open this - it wasn™t a school - whoever wanted to come , 
like, people that were more or less on that
 level, on Renia™s leve
l I had a few, and on 
Chris™s level I had a few, and Chris was 
teaching. She was also teaching, but she was 

teaching younger kids, and I was good at schoo
l because when I was in Radom, I had a 
French teacher who just, I don™t know, sheliked me , loved me. So, when people had 

problems with the French language - and I 
learned very fast - so when people had 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
18 
 
troubles, she says, she made me  a tutor. S
o, right from the beginning almo st. And, if I 
was their tutor, they passed. No, but most lik
ely, I could do it. So, 
you know, I had a little 
bit of experience from Radom. So, when I came home  during the war, my  pupils were 
very happy with me . Some  of the m were until 
today - as a ma tter of fact, I went now to 
the Wi erzbnik Society meeting and I met tw
o of my pupils. They kissed me  and went, 
ﬁMy lovely teacher.ﬂ  And I was not
 very much older than them. 
 
Q: That™s true. You were fifteen, 
sixteen years old at this time . 
 
A: Yeah,that™strue. 
 
Q: Do you remember how you treated Renia?  
 
A: I™ll tell you. I think that I trea
ted them well. I thought that, bu
t I was very strict with my 
pupils, and especially strict with Renia. Reni
a says that I was some ti me s I™d give her a 
smack. I don™t remembe r  it. Renia must tell you. 
As a ma tter of fact, one day, Renia, like, 
when we arrived here, we got together the th
ree of us, and Renia says that she reme mbers 
that I gave, you know, I smacked her a few times
. So, I said, and I started crying because 
I didn™t reme mber. I said, ﬁ Why would I do it? ﬂ 
So, she wanted to be nice to me , and on 
the way home they ca me back out. She st
opped some where. She called me . She said, 
ﬁYou know what?  I remi nd myself that I gave 
it back to you.ﬂ She wanted me  to feel 
better. She didn™t, but I don™t reme mber 
it. Maybe it™s true, but I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: Was this good for you to be able 
to teach them, to have that time?  
 
A: I was very, you know, like I was really happy to
 be a teacher because I noticed that the 
kids - those kids looked at me  with such 
admi ration. So, I really enjoyed it, and I know 
that Renia™s friend - the one in
 Israel - whenever she talks 
to me  on the phone, she recites 
all the poems, even the Latin poems, that I made them me morize. I myself reme mber it. 
As a ma tter of fact, when I was 
in the university in Toronto after the war, after I came to 
Canada, and on my first - I took - the first c
ourse I took was Fr ench. So, I reme mber all 
the French Canadians, they speak pe rfect Fr
ench. I wasn™t - my French was only from 
school, so I couldn™t speak so fluently, but
 I remember grammar and everything much 
better, and one day the teacher come s when we were taking La  Fontaine, that™s a Fr ench 

poet, and he says, ﬁDoes any of you reme mber
 any poems ? ﬂ  And, reme mber that this is 
years and years after; that was when I was 
already Canada and we came he re in 1948, and 
I didn™t go to school until 1970. So, that was in
 1970. So, I said to him, ﬁI reme mber 
Maître Corbeau,
, but I don™t know whether I™d reme mb
er it all.ﬂ So, he said, ﬁ Would you 
like to try it?ﬂ So, I said, ﬁO
kay.ﬂ So, I closed my eyes like this and I started and I 
reme mbered the whole poem. So, after I fini
shed, the whole class stood up and clapped, 
and I was so proud that I reme mbered, be
cause, you know, it™s how ma ny years from 
1939 to 1970?

Q: Let me  go back a few years, because I was r
ecalling that Chris said that, prior to you™re 
going to Radom to high school, you would bri
ng home  friends and you would sit around 
and you would talk about books, and Renia said
 she also was listening, but she was sort 
of listening, and Chris said you 
wouldn™t let them be part of
 the group because they were 
children. Do you have any recoll ection of your friends comi nginto the house and talking 
about books?  
 
A: I had a lot of friends. I always had a lot of friends, but you know, I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: You don™t reme mber?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. What do you reme mber about your pa
rents during this peri
od, ™39 to ™41, when 
things are beginning to get tougher, but they™re 
not quite as bad as they become ?  Is your 
father working?  He™s lost his job, I gather. 
 
A: Yeah, he lost his job. Fi rst of all, he lost
 his job because he was 
assessing the forests and 
stuff like that for the government. In 1933, he 
lost the job and he lost his pensions.  
 
Q: ™33 or ™37?  
 
A: No, he lost his - the governme nt job in ™
33, and then he started working in the same  
capacity for private enterprise, which wasn™t
 the same , and the reason why they let him 
go because they didn™t want to pay his pensi
on, or because he was Jewish, they didn™t 
want to pay his pension. So, my
 parents went - they struggled but we lived norma lly like 
any other, because the Jewish people - the 
Jewish population, especially the religious 
ones, they were tradesmen, small businessme
n. They were all poor, 
like, they weren™t 
rich people. So, although we were quite - 
we lived quite modestly, we weren™t any 
different than any other people. I reme mber, 
my  mother learned a trade but it was, you 
know, I don™t really reme mber exactly what - 
my father was also selling some thing. I 
couldn™t tell you really exactly wh
at they did during the war. 
 
Q: So, if you would– 
 
A: Riches wasn™t important then. 
 
Q: But, you did have a ma id. 
 
A: Yes, we did. 
 
Q: And a seams t ress and a laundre
ss, I believe, before the war. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
20 
 
A: Yeah, they were comi ng once a mo nth. It wa
sn™t  that  they were there all the time. We 
didn™t have a ma id continuously. We  did - there 
were two sisters where we lived that they 
were doing this kind of work. So, like, to 
wash the laundry, I don™t know if they were 
comi ng onc e a month or every two weeks. I 
couldn™t tell you. I don™t really reme mb er, 
because during the war, during ghetto we didn™
t have any help any more and Renia and 
Krysia would reme mber more of wha t  we had 
right before the war because they were at 
home. 
 
Q: So, one wouldn™t have to be w
ealthy to bring in some  people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So, if you would describe– 
 
A: But, my parents were both educated. So, 
that was the difference between them and - I 
mean, there were a few others that were lik
e my parents, but most of the people were 
religious, educated only - that
™s all they knew: how to pr
ay and how to– You know, that 
was the type - that™s the type of
 people that lived in our town. 
 
Q: When is the ghetto formed, in your view
?  I can™t quite understa
nd because it doesn™t 
become  a closed ghetto. 
 
A: No, at first - I would think that was ™41, ma
ybe ™40 - when they moved us  from our first 
location to the second location, and they were
 closing on, but it wasn™t closed. We  were 
not supposed to get out of the camp unless we 
had a work permit or whatever. That™s how 
close to the, how should I say, October the 27
th
, people were going to work, too, because 
we had an 
Arbeitsamt, 
a German 
Arbeitsamt
 that said - enlisti
ng people for work. And a 
lot of people from the villages were comi ng to
 Star achowice already in the ghetto to look 
for work, but they had to come  some how, 
ma ybe  they were brought by the Germans, I 
couldn™t tell you, but I kn
ow that we had an 
Arbeitsamt,
 which is a labor bureau, 
whatever you call it, where people were co
mi ng and asking for work because they knew 
from the other places that  only the ones that
 will work will live. Because we heard what 
was going in Wa rsaw and all over. So, people - 
as a ma tter of fact I was working in the 
Arbeitsamt
, and my father and I we both worked in the 
Arbeitsamt
. 
 
Q: I think we have to change the tape. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
End of Tape #2

Tape #3
 
 
Q: –And I think that story about 
that holiday, that™s a wonderful
 st-, I mean, it™s a very - I 
understand. 
 
A: But, you know, I cried my eyes out, and, ag
ain, the people that I knew in Radom, the 
Jewish people that were sending their kids to
 hi gh school there because it was expensive, 
well-to-do people. So, at that time, it wasn™t 
nice to be - you had to be rich. You wouldn™t 
admit that you weren™t. So, let™s say my mo
ther was sending me  home baking on Friday. 
Every Friday she would send me  a parcel 
with some one who wa
s going that way. And 
my girlfriends loved my  mother™s baking. And th
is was for the whole week for me  to eat! 
Because I didn™t, you know, it wasn™t that she 
was, she says, ﬁOh, today is Friday! Let™s 
go to Hania. She has her mother™s cake!ﬂ A
nd those kids, they didn™t mi ss anything. You 
know, they were rich kids. They ate all my
 cakes. My mother would buy me  fruits like 
oranges that were extremel
y expensive, but for me , ma ybe one orange, ma ybe a few 
grapes. You know, she would do the best she co
uld. And they ate everything and I didn™t 
have what to eat for the whole week. 
 
Q: Hania, I want to take us back to your life 
in Radom, because I thi
nk it™s important for us 
to get a sense of what it mean
t for you to be that indepe
ndent, and how different it was 
for you to be home than for your other sisters to
 be home. So, let™s ta
lk a little about what 
your life was like during th
at time and some  incidences that happened to you. 
 
A: Well, I lived in - my mot her used to rent
 a room for me in a friend™s pl ace or whatever 
and I lived there for the 10 months; for the 
vacation I went home . 
And she did the best 
she could. She washed my laundry every week. 
I sent her my laundry to be washed at 
home  because I didn™t ha ve the facilities. 
And every week she would send me  the home 
baking and the best she could, she could afford 
to buy at the time: some fruits that were 
imported that were so expensive that only th
e sick ones would get them some ti me s. And I 
was very good at school, so I 
had no problem there. I always 
had straight A™s. My parents 
were very proud of me ; they were always br
agging. And I also tutored French, and I was 
paid for those lessons, so this was my  spe
nding money. We  could go to a movie or for ice 
cream, like, we were going in groups, but it was 
expensive, so I could afford to pay for it 
because I was ma king some  money there. And fo
r holidays, I usually used to come home, 
but for the Yom Kippur  and the Rosh Hashan
a, I not always could because it was the 
beginning of school and I didn™t want to mi ss - 
don™t forget, I was the only Jewish girl in 
our class, so I couldn™t affo
rd to mi ss a week of school 
at the very beginning. So, I 
reme mber, one year I was living with the prof
essor, the professor™s family, and for the 
holidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt 
and uncle in Radom. My uncle was the brother 
of my father, but I di
dn™t live with them. I lived with this family. And the lady of the 
house asked me  what am I going to do for 
the holidays. So, I couldn™t say ﬁnothingﬂ 
because I didn™t want to be invited by them, 
because it is a family holiday and they had 
their family. So, she says, ﬁ What are you going to
 do? ﬂ So, I said to her, ﬁMy aunt invited 
me  for dinner.ﬂ So she said, ﬁOh, that™s good.ﬂ So
 when they sat at the table, I went out 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
22 
 
on the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting 
everywhere. And I wasn™t invited to my aunt™s
 for the holidays. I was walking the st reets 
until I got tired, and I 
sat down on a stone some where near
 the road and started crying. I 
cried myself to death. I was so hungry and I 
was thinking of the house and I was envious 
of my sisters being there, you know, with the 
whole family and eating well and all. So, I 
really felt very bad and I couldn™t go home  un
til they finished the dinner because I went 
to my aunt™s officially, so when I came  home
, and they were already - I heard the dishes 
being washed and put away - and I went to
 bed. I was so hungry. I was so hungry, so I 
cried all night. That™s how I reme mb er one
 of the incidents of being independent. 
 
Q: And why, were you not close with your aunt?  
 
A: No, my aunt was very envious that I 
was - from t he beginning, when I was accepted, 
when my mother brought me  to Ra dom and wh
en I passed the exam and the results were 
being, like, ‚til the end of the summer , the re
sults were unknown. So, my
 aunt says to my 
mother, ﬁWhat do you expect?  Y
ou come from a  small town 
there, and you come  from 
Wi erzbnik, that they™ll accept you with open arms?  
Fi rst of all, she has 
to pass as the best 
exam because she™s Jewish. Secondly, what do 
you expect?  They have in Radom a lot of 
people that they know, and they™re pr ominen
t people, that they™ll accept you? ﬂ And she 
says, ﬁThe hair will grow on my wri s t if 
she would be accepted.ﬂ So, anyway, towards 
the end, my mother registered
 - at the same  ti me , she re
gistered me  at the Jewish 
gymnasium
. And when she came to look at the re
sults, she went by herself because she 
was sure that I won™t be accepted. So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep-  my 

name  was there, so she fa inted. And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure 
that this is true, they all went to see whether 
it™s true. But that  wasn™t the only - I talked to 
her ma ny times. We had ma ny conversations 
because she was in America. And she 
knows that she did me  wrong. But she had two so
ns and she says that she didn™t want me  
to live in her house because the sons were
 my age , and that was her explanation. 
 
Q: So, you sometimes ma de decisions–?  
 
A: No. I mean, I had to ma ke decisions the wa
y I could. I was just a 
kid. I couldn™t call my 
parents; we didn™t have a te
lephone. I reme mber it one time, 
I was sick, and I was living 
in another place where, like, I had a gi rlfrie
nd in the family, so they accepted me , and I 
shared her room. And I got sick, so my landl
ady called my mother to come  and pick me  
up because, I mean, she wasn™t ready to look af
ter a sick child. So, my mother came  a nd 
picked me  up and took me  home for  a week
 or two until I recovered and I came back. 
 
Q: And I understand that the 
packages she would send you– 
 
A: Yeah, the packages - every Friday she woul
d - because she baked for - every Friday she 
baked a babka, and other very - I mean, he
r baking was very good - and every Friday, she 
would send me  a parcel containing, like, her ba
king and some  imported fr
uit, a little bit of 
this, a little bit of that, which was very speci
al and very expensive. And I had a lot of 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
23 
 
friends in Radom that visit me many times, and we went out with them to the movies. 
And they knew that on Fr iday night, I would ge
t a parcel  with all 
the goodies, so they 
say, ﬁLet™s go to Hania because she got a par
cel!ﬂ But those kids were at ho me  and they 
didn™t mi ss anything, and I didn™t have anythi
ng for the week. I mean, except for the 
dinner that I was given. 
Like, when my mother paid for the room, she paid also for one 
meal for me to eat, a hot meal, and th
e rest I was supposed to buy by myself. 
 
Q: So, where would you then eat breakfast and lunch?  
 
A: In my room, but you know, like, it wasn™t
 like - I would have a bagel and cheese or 
some thing. And I reme mber I had a tremendous appetite, and one day my father came to 
visit me. And on the way from the train, he 
stopped to buy bagels 
- not bagels, I think 
rolls, kaiser rolls - and cheese, because I real
ly liked the yellow cheese. So, he bought six 
rolls for me  to have for the week or what
ever. And I reme mb er, he never forgot to 
mention it that I had all six 
rolls at one time. [Laughs.] 
 
Q: So, you really had a big appetite! 
 
A: Tremendous , because I gr ew very fast. When I came to Radom, I was the smallest one in 
my class, but when I was thirteen year s old, I gr ew twelve centimeters. I was the tallest 
one in my class. And from there on, when we 
carried the insignia of the school, the tallest 
used to get it, I used to be the one. 
 
Q: Tell me , what was it like for you to be th
e only Jewish kid in th
at school?  Was that 
di ffi cul t?  
 
A: It wasn™t difficult because - I had a few kids
 that were really ri diculing me, they called 
me  all kinds of na me s - but they were just a fe
w. But in general, I tried to be like them. I 
helped them out, I stayed 
after school, did their assi
gnments, helped them with 
everythi ng, like, for free because I wanted so 
badl y to mi x with them. And certain people, 
ones, I learned to disregard what they were sa
ying. They called me  all sorts of na me s. I™m 
not saying ‚they™ because there were a couple of
 such girls. I reme mber them very well. 
So if they called me  such name s, I just pr
etended not to hear. But I had also one case 
where the parents treated me  very badly. I was s
itting at one desk with a girl called Janina 
Kremska (ph). Her father was a judge; I don™
t know what her mother - her mother was 
apparently not well. I couldn™t te
ll you - I have never before 
been in her house. Before we 
left she offered that she would take me  to 
the station. We  had some  ti me  yet. So, I took 
my suitcase and - when we got our school cer
tificate at the end of 
the year, our marks - 
so, she says, ﬁYou come , we™ll have lunch at 
our house, and I™ll take you to the station, 
I™ll help you.ﬂ So I went to her house. Sh
e wasn™t a very good student. Anyway, the 
mother asked her to show her her report card. So, the mother looked and didn™t say 
anything. So, before she set the lunch, she asked me  if I™d show her mi ne . So, I always 
had straight A™s, I mean, that was to me - 
I took it out without even thinking that I could 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
24 
 
have told her that I don™t want to because 
I knew Janina Kremska (ph) wasn™t such a 
good student. She got so ma d, she 
threw me  out of the house! 
 
Q: She got mad at you?  
 
A: At me . She got ma d at me , but she told 
me  later the father apologized. He came down 
later and he apologizes. He said
 to me that she™s not - she™s not - that she™s sick. But I 
didn™t notice that she should be sick. She ju
st threw me  out, she told me  to go. So, you 
say, ﬁHow did they treat you? ﬂ We
ll, that was my best friend! 
 
Q: And the teachers at the school?  
 
A: Well, that™s also, some - all the teachers we
re - the French teacher was Catholic, but she 
was converted. She was really Jewish. She l
oved me  - I had no problems with her. And 
the teachers in general liked me  because I 
was a good student . Like, even in Latin, I was 
getting harder work, like when we had an exam
 at school, she would put
 me at the end of 
the class with a longer exam because she didn™t 
want me to sit there while the others were 
still struggling. So, the teachers liked me  b
ecause I was a good student. As a ma tter of 
fact, there was a ma the matics teacher, her na
me  was Kostetska (ph). Nobody ever had a - 
like, we had numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so 5 was th
e best, you know, it™s like ‚very good™ here. 
I was the only one that, throughout the school, I 
used to get 5. My friend still today says, 
ﬁIf you got a 5 from Kost etska (ph), you™re lu
cky.ﬂ So, the teachers 
all liked me , but the 
secretary - the secretary, whenever I went th
ere, she ma de very bad rema rks to me . One 
day, she says, ﬁWhat™s your name ? ﬂ  I said, 
ﬁAnna Laks.ﬂ She says, ﬁYour name  isn™t 
Anna. Your name  is Hannah.ﬂ I says, ﬁNo, 
my na me  is Anna.ﬂ And she says, ﬁNo, your 
name is Hannah.ﬂ And she emphasized the ‚H™ because she couldn™t st and it that my 

name  was Polish while I was Jewish. And she 
was mean to me, but I mean, I didn™t come 
in contact with her too much, only when I ha
d to bring my parents™ check for the tuition. 
But I did feel a little bit of anti-Semitism, but
 I disregarded it completely because most of 
the girls were really nice to me . There was 
45 of us and we met after school, and then 
there were da nces. I di dn™t have any pr
oblem because - there was a similar men™s 

gymnasium
 under the same  na me  as ours - so, once a year we had a dance, so they put all 
the boys in a row and the girls in a row, 
and whoever you me t you had to dance. So, I 
never had any problems, but I heard from a friend
 - as a matter of fact we just talked the 
other day about it - from a male friend that, 
he was standing across from one Polish girl 
and she was so cute, and then she says, ﬁI don™
t dance with Jews.ﬂ He says he felt so bad 
because it ne ver happene d before because 
he was a good-looking boy. So, there were - 
but as I said, the few incidents that were happening to me I tried to di sregard because 

otherwise I couldn™t live with
 them. I was the only one! 
 
Q: Do you know if other Jews applied to the 
school - other Jewish gi
rls applied to that 
school as well and couldn™t get in?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
25 
 
A: Oh, yes, because I have  here - there is how
 ma ny are we here? There 
are about five of us 
left from tha t  school, and we still meet here.  
 
Q: Jewish girls, you mean?  
 
A: Yes, because  one year they accepted four gi
rls instead of one girl
, and after that it was 
numerus nolus
 already. Why four gi rls?  Because one of
 the girls that lives here in Miami, 
her father had a brick factory, so he built a 
gymna sium for the school for free, so they 
accepted the four girls. When I say gymnasiu
m,  like exercise , a big exercise gymnasium 
for the school. He donated the bricks and the labor. 
 
Q: Tell me  something, going back now to the 
ghetto, when the Germans attach Russian in 
June of 1941, do you reme mber that 
as being a significant change?  
 
A: Idon™t. 
 
Q: You don™t?  Okay. So, the ghetto experience up 
to the end of the ghetto, October, when do 
you start working in the brick factory with Chris?  
 
A: Okay, first I worked in 
Arbeitsamt
, and they closed this - ma
ybe I should also not tell you 
that a German, before we got sent to the 
camp, that a German under the name  Pohl - P-O-
H-L - who was the 
Lagerführer
 of Majowka, he was comi ng to recruit some  people, like, 
pick some  other new people, you know, to wo
rk. He noticed me  working in the office 
there, and so he was always telling us things, 
that the ghetto is going to be liquidated. But 
he didn™t tell us when; he only told us that
 it™s going to be liquidated. Anyway, towards 
the end, the last time he came to the office, 
he told us that the ghetto is going to be 
liquidated the day later than in real
ity it was. So, we had an idea. So, 
Arbeitsamt 
- about 
two weeks before they liquidate
d the ghetto, they closed the 
Arbeitsamt
. The 
Arbeitsamt
 
wasn™t needed anymore because the people th
at had the war cards already were located. 
And Krysia and I– 
 
Q: Excuse me , but the 
Arbeitsamt
 did what?  
 
A: They were assigning people - like, they 
were employing people. They were assigning 
people to different factories  
 
Q: In the area. 
 
A: In the area. We had, we had the ________ wo
rker, where they were ma king bullets, they 
were ma king guns. This was a war kind of f
actory, a big factory. Rogalin (ph) was a 
place where they were ma king bricks. So, towa
rds the end, when we knew that we have 
to work somewhere else, that we have  to 
get our cards, Krysia and I started working - 
they closed the 
Arbeitsamt
, let™s say, I think it was 
about two weeks before the 
liquidation. It could have been
 three weeks or ma ybe shorte
r, I couldn™t tell you. But we 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
26 
 
started working in this factor
y, on the night shift, Chris and 
I. Like, when they liquidated 
the ghetto, we had to find anothe
r job. When they liquidated the 
Arbeitsamt
, I started 
working for this brick factory and Krysia worked with me  at night. 
 
Q: And you we re doing what?  
 
A: We were ma king bricks. Like
, there were machines, but we stayed in water, I mean, the 
water was dripping, and we were ma king those 
bricks. We  were putting the stuff in those 
machinery and when the bricks were comi ng out, we were working– 
 
Q:  Now, your mother was not working?  
 
A: No, but I provided her, like, a card, too. I m
ean, she wasn™t working just for her to have a 
card. Everybody had to have a working card. 
 
Q: And your father was also working in the 
Arbeitsamt
? 
 
A: No, he worked in the 
Arbeitsamt
. And I don™t reme mber what - 
I don™t think that he - or 
ma ybe he went to work? I couldn™t tell you la
ter. I couldn™t tell you 
because it was very  
short-lived. That was a very hard time for all 
of us  because we  heard already that there 
was that village and this village, and th
ey were bringing the people to St arachowice 
because, in these villages, they only ha
d a few - not too ma ny Jews, because the 
liquidation was for the whole district there. 
 
Q: So, you™re hearing rumo rs 
about the killing of Jews. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And does it ma ke any conn
ection with you about what–?  
 
A: It did, it di d. But we felt that if we wo
rked, we will survive, because that was the - 
everybody believed that if you worked, you save
 your life. Because I don™t think they 
paid for the labor. I don™t reme mber whethe
r we got paid for the _______ work when we 
were ma king bricks, but once you 
worked,  you saved your life. 
 
Q: So, that was the strategy. And Reni
a, what was she doing at that time? 
 
A: Renia, I don™t know what she was doing be
fore, because she was, during the liquidation, 
she was at the ma rketplace with Mother and Father, and Krysia and I were at work 
because we worked night shift. 
 
Q: I wanted to ask you about a story that
 Chris told, and I wanted to know if you 
reme mbered it and how you reme mb ered it. She 
talked about all of you being outside - I 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
27 
 
still don™t know whether Renia was outside 
- you were outside some where where there 
were bushes. And some  guy came out and us
ed the code word ﬁAmhatﬂ was used. 
 
A: Amhut. 
 
Q: Amhut. You knew that he was Jewish. And he
 said that he escaped from Treblinka. And 
Chris tells the story that she re
ally didn™t believe him;  she didn™t know what he was really 
talking about. She brought him inside the hous
e, or the apartment, 
or wherever you were 
staying, to your parents, and 
your parents kicked you all out a
nd talked with him. Do you 
have any recollection?  
 
A: I don™t reme mber, no. 
 
Q: So, what recollection do you have of what
 you™re hearing about what the Nazis are 
doing?  
 
A: We were scared but we believed, we some
how believed that if 
we have work, we™ll 
survived. So, that was our ma in - like, we tr
ied to work, to have the proper papers to 
prove that we work. 
 
Q: Do you remember the illness, the 
typhus, that your mother had?  
 
A: I reme mber my mother being very sick. I 
reme mb er this, that she almost died. But she 
was sick at home. That wasn™t in the camp. 
 
Q:  Yes, this is before. 
 
A: It was before. I reme mber it very well, and 
I reme mber the Paliszewskis were comi ng to the 
house to help with th
at. Renia will tell you. 
 
Q:  So, in spite of the rumor s that you™re 
hearing about the extermination of Jews, you still 
think that they™re ex
terminating Jews who 
either can™t work or won™t work?  Or you–?  
 
A:  We still, we couldn™t believe that things
 like that could happen. Although we heard about 
it, we tried to work in order to save our liv
es, but we still did not 
believe that they are 
exterminating them. We still believed that 
they are deporting them somewhere for other 
work. But we wanted to stay where we ar
e because we knew already what it was. 
 
Q:  Did you ever get depressed during this 
period, before the liquidation of the ghetto?  
 
A: You know, I don™t - I was so engrossed in sa
ving our lives. I was al
ways trying to save 
my life. And I knew that I will eventually di e,
 whether I will be killed that  way or the 
other way, but life was so precious that we c
oncentrated more on how to live than how– 
I don™t remember being depressed. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
28 
 
 
Q: Butfrightened. 
 
A: Frightened. 
 
Q: Yeah. Do you reme mber the mood of peopl
e around you, other than your fa mily, the way 
people were?  
 
A:  Other than my fa mily, I don™t reme mber. Bu
t while we™re talking about it, I will tell you, 
the grown-ups were mor e  scared. Because
, see, when you are young, you™re daring, and 
you are not so afraid because you think to your
self, ﬁI will run awa
y.ﬂ That™s why we™re 
thinking of uprising inside the camp already in
 Starachowice, because we didn™t want  to 
be killed just like we heard that
 other people are getting killed. 
 
Q: All right, we™ll stop the came ra here. 
End of Tape #3

Tape #4
 
 
Q: Hania, let™s talk about the 
night of the evacuation, or the night before. You and Chris are 
in the brick factory doing the night shift, but
 they don™t let you go in the morning. So, tell 
me about that day and what you remember.
 
 
A: We are expecting the liquidation of the ghetto
 a day later. My mother prepared everyone 
of us had a knapsack, I mean, whatever, so that
 when we are going to work anywhere, it 
was a little bit of clothes, 
you know, and it was - but a change - some  shoes ma ybe or so. 
So, everybody had it ready for th
e next day. But, unfortunately we went to work in our 
work clothes for the night, not knowing that 
the liquidation would be
 that night. So, we 
didn™t take anything with us, only the way we 
were. And at night we noticed on the roof 
of the factory, like thro
ugh the window - throug
h the roof - above the 
roof of the fac t ory, 
we saw people walking toward the station, wa
lking, and Germans with dogs and we were 
wondering what happened. So, we knew that th
e liquidation is going on, 
and we tried to - 
I mean, it wasn™t far from the station, but 
we couldn™t - we only saw lots of people 
walking slowly with kids, but we didn™t see 
any of our relatives or
 friends. We  tried to. 
They told us that we will go straight to cam
p. At that time , we  had three ready camps to 
move in. Strzelnica, which was the biggest
 camp, Majowka, which was the smallest 
camp. So, just to give you an idea, let™s sa
y in St rzelnica, they could keep a thousand 
people. Majowka was about five hundred. I m
ean, it™s not exact, but 
just to give you an 
idea that Majowka was a smaller camp, and th
ey had a third camp called Tartak (ph). 
This camp - it was a sawmill and they only had room for about a hundred workers. So, 
some people, as you know, from the marketplace
, they all went to Strzelnica, the ones 
that were chosen to work. The ones that we
re chosen to die, at that time  nobody knew 
where they were going, went to 
the train station. We were sent
 direct to Majowka, and in 
Majowka this Pohl, guy was the 
Lagerführer
. He was in charge of that 
Lager
. So, when 
we arrived there, he right away - I mean, si
nce he knew that I had experience, he put me  

in his office. I don™t remember what Krysia
 was to do. Then, we found out that - we 
didn™t know who survived. We  didn™t know whet
her Renia was alive, whether my father 
was alive - I didn™t know that, whether my mothe r
 is alive. We  had no idea. We  were sent 
to Majowka, and Renia and Father we re sent to
 St rzelnica. Of course, my father went to 
the office right away because they knew him also from the 
Arbeitsamt
. And I don™t 
reme mber whether that day or some other da
y we  found out that my mother didn™t make 
it, that she wa s sent out togeth
er with the other people. We believed that they were sent 
some where else. We  never believed that th
ey were going to Treblinka although we heard 
about Treblinka ma ny times, but in our mi nd, we
 couldn™t believe that atrocities like that 
could happen. So, life was hard. Like, the people 
that went to Strzelni ca, started going to 
work right away. I don™t reme mber what Kr
ysia did. Maybe she was working with– I 
don™t know. I don™t reme mber where she worke
d. A few days later,
 and Vaschek (ph) 
was in charge of the other 
Lager
, came  to inspect what - because he was actually in 
charge of the two 
Lagers
; Pohl was in the smaller camp. He c a me  to the office. He 
looked at my work, and he says, ﬁYou know wh
a t? ﬂ I think that because he liked the way 
I wrote those lists, you know, those - we starte
d - what did we do at the office?  We  kept 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
30 
 
records of all the people that lived there.
 Everyone had a card. On the card, it was his 
name, the barrack number, because, I mean, th
e date of birth, and the barrack number, 
and where he worked. Then, from those cards, 
we  were ma king up lists - daily work lists 
- because  they were different de partme nts in 
the factory and those workers, like, in the 
morning, you would call the name s and they would go to those, and the next day ma ybe 
they were changed. So, I was ma king all those 
lists. So, I reme mber Vaschek (ph) liked 
the way I make the lists and he says, ﬁFrom 
now on,ﬂ he sent my fa
ther. So, Krysia was 
with my father, and since Renia 
was in Strzelnica, I was sent 
to Strzelnica to do the work 
there, to work in the office. Now, I™ll ju
st me ntion it, because if some body died, was 
killed, whatever, most of the people were very strong, the ones that committed 

themselves to work, so they didn™t die the nor
ma l way. Most of them were either killed 
here or there. We  used to write down in 
the Polish ﬁdeceasedﬂ, and we kept the cards 
separate. Otherwise, we knew exactly how ma
ny people we have in each camp. Tartak 
(ph) was a separate unit. They had their own 
office and their own people. They - it wasn™t 
connected. But those two camps wer e  connected. 
 
Q: So, you were ma king the lists for both camps. 
 
A: I was keeping all the records. The records 
to - Vaschek (ph) - ma ybe I™ll talk about him 
when I talk about the other Germans - he kept 
under lock and key; that was in his office. 
And in the morning was allowed to go in ther
e, take whatever I needed to do the - to 
prepare whatever, and I had to put it back in
 his office and he was the only one that had 
access. I didn™t have any access to any of t
hose records. I was doing what I was supposed 

to, I put it in the place, a
nd it went under lock and key. 
Now, the structure - are you 
interested in the structure? 
 
Q: Yes, it™s very important. It™s very important, yes, please. 
 
A: So, I™ll star t with Strzelni ca. The same wa
s in Majowka. We  had a Judenrat - first the 
Jewish people - we had a Judenrat, we  had 
the police, and we had 
people that were in 
charge of the - where they lived in the barr
acks. The Judenrat were the elders - do you 
need the names? 
 
Q: That would be great. 
 
A: Mr. Minzbe rg (ph), Mr. Billingr iecht (ph)
, Mr. Einisemann (ph), Mr. Wolfowicz (ph). 
The police - there were 12 policemen, 12 Jewi
sh policemen, and one in charge, and the 
one in charge was my husband™s father. Then there were Ukrainians - guards. They 

were– 
 
Q: Go back to how the Judenrat was 
chosen and how the police were chosen. 
 
A: I couldn™t tell you because when I came  to St
rzelnica, that was alre
ady a done fact. What 
the police we re doing. The policeme n had no rights
 of any sort, just gather together the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

people in the morning. They were suppos
ed to keep an order inside the 
Lager
, but people 
at that time  were very orde
rly, they were doing what they 
were supposed to do. So, there 
was no problem of this sort, but their ma in j
ob was to bring all thos
e people - they came  
to the office, got the list,this one, this one. So, they 
would round up those people that 
were going to this departme nt, this departme nt. The policeme n would take them to the 
gate, and from the gate, the Ukrainians would take over. And, they were supposed to 

keep an order, and of course, when the Germ
ans used to come  and whatever they had to 
do, they were using them to do what - what 
should I say?  They had no arms, no - not only 
no arms, no sticks, no anything. Like
, there was about 12 of them. 
 
Q: Did they wear any special hats or anyt
hing?  Did they have 
any way of identifying 
themselves? 
 
A: I don™t reme mber. They must have had, but I 
don™t reme mber . I really don™t reme mber , to 
tell you the truth. Then, there was Judenrat. 
They were in charge, you know, of - they 
were responsible for the kitchen and for 
the supplies and, you know, in general - the 
Germans would dump the food and dump it, and th
ey were in charge of all those, I me an, 
they were running a camp where was a thousand 
or over people. So, they had to be fed, 
they had to be clothed, they were bringing 
the clothes at one time and just dump it. And 
at the office, let™s say, I and ma ybe another tw
o or three girls to he
lp were giving out the 
clean stuff for the people, like because, you know, and they were responsible for the 

inside of the camp. And there was a lot of - 
there was a lot of brib
ery going on. They had 
to pay the Ge rmans off for this and for whatev
er. They did the smallest favor, they were 
collecting whatever they could collect. A
nd a lot of the Germans were only asking for 
bribes. Now, what was - so, the guards - I™ll 
go back now to the guards - the guards we re 
watching the gate. There was a tower, one to
wer near the gate where they watching, and 
as I said, they were taking people to work
 and from work, and they were transporting 

whatever had to be transported. Now, the 
guards were Ukrainians. Then there were 
Germans, he ads of the guards. So, there wasthree of them. There was Schrodt - he wa s 

fa mous and notorious and I™ll 
tell you stories about him - 
Schleizier and Wolf. There 
were three shifts. So, a German was responsib
le for the guards. Then, we had - we had 
the 
Lagerführer
, which was responsible for the camp. 
He lived outside of ca mp, but he 
was there all day. That was in 
Strzelnica. I™ll talk about St
rzelnica because I was there the 
longest. His name  was Vaschek (ph). He was a 
sudetendeutche
 (ph), which me ans he 
came from Czechoslovakia. He
 spoke Czechoslovakian, Czech, so we could understand. 
He could understand Polish, and he had the gr
een uniform, and he was - he had a very 
foul language. He talked so badly, but he had 
- he was the only one that had a heart, the 
only one, because he never - he would always 
screamed at the people, screamed at and 
swore at them, even at me, like he called meall kinds of name , but I didn™t pay attention 

because I knew that he ha d a heart. He neve
r touched a Jew, although he ha d this rubber 
stick. He would pick it up and he would scream
, ﬁGet the hell out of here.ﬂ And he was 
screaming, but he never - to such a degree 
that once he told th
e Ukrainians, ﬁNo one 
touches my Jews. Only I have the right to touc
h my Jews.ﬂ So, he wa
sn™t so bad, and as a 
ma tter of fac t , he was there for a long tim
e. I don™t know why he was later let go. He 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
32 
 
went to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me  that he was 
horrible there. So, I don™t know. He was the only German that I could say a good word 
about because the ot hers were all mu rderer
s and, I mean, I™ll tell you stories unbelievable 
stories. Then we had - then we had in cam
p, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in 
camp all the time. Then there was a guy by th
e name  of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing 
all the camps, but he would only come  for an
 hour. He would talk with Vaschek (ph). 
You know, they would walk and talk. He wasn
™t yet - I mean, he wasn™t good, but he 
wasn™t yet as bad as the top ma n was  called 
Altov (ph). He was the most horrible killer 
that one, I mean, he was - he was killing Je
ws and when he arrived into the camp, he 
wanted everybody to freeze in the place where 
- if you walked you had to stand up. He 
jumped over fences. He killed from all kinds
 of situations, like 
he would sit down, he 
would jump, he would kill people that  appear ed on his way, and we will just ma ke a note 

then at the office that is deceased. He was th
e worst of them, and apparently I heard that 
he was from a family because there was as
 I said called Altov (ph), apparently in 
Germany a very famous  circus. So, he must 
have been an acrobat, because the way he 
behaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill pe
ople from all positions like him. Everybody 
was so scared of hi m that I didn™t even look in his - I don™t even - I don™t reme mber his 

face because when he came  to the office and aske d for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that 
- I was afraid to look up. So, that was the wo
rst. Then, in the factories we had - we had 
people. Okay. 
 
Q: Can I ask you a question about some body 
like Altov (ph)?  How did you - how did you 
ma ke sense then or how do you ma ke se
nse now of this kind of brutality? 
 
A: I think that he was not accepted by the Ge
rmans because I think - he didn™t have a 
uniform, he didn™t have an SS, most likely b
ecause we found out later, whether it™s true  
or not, we met his mother in Auschwitz a
nd she was a gypsy. Whether this was the same  
Mrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been becau
se I talked personally with her. When I 
heard that she was an Altov (ph), I we nt and 
I talked to her. And the way she described 
him, it must have been her son, and she says 
she was a gypsy and they were in the circus 
business. So, I can™t tell you, but he wasn™t 
an SS ma n. Everybody was afraid of him.  The 
Judenrat was afraid of him. They were hard
ly talking to him, and I™m telling you, I mean 
I would freeze. I put my eyes down, I so was 
afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I 
was afraid that he would shoot me  in a mi nute. 
 
Q: But, the Germans didn™t stop him. Th
ey didn™t care that he was doing this. 
 
A: They didn™t care. He was the 
worst and he was - his title was 
Stumführer
 (ph). Then we 
had - and Meyer (ph)  died, I think, yes, he died. So, he was replaced by a guy called 
Colditz (ph). He was very fat ma n. He was 
also screaming. He was almos t  as bad as 
Altov (ph). 
 
Q: On the Judenrat. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
33 
 
A: No, no, he was almost as bad as Altov (
ph) by his behavior like when he was comi ng 
they™d he also dema nded to freeze, people to 
freeze, and then they were the people, the 
Sicherheit Polizei
, which was the, like - I don™t know how to say 
encavudei 
(ph) in 
Russian, how do 
Sicherheit Polizei
 (ph), they were– 
 
Q: Intelligencepolice? 
 
A: Intelligencepolice.Okay? 
 
Q: Maybe security police. 
 
A: That™sright, 
Sicherheit
 (ph). And, I™ll tell you stories abou
t him, what he did to people, 
because I™ll give spec
ific stories about him, horribl e man, horrible. Then there was 
Kashmi der (ph), and who was in charge of
, like - the Germans were - the Germans 
soldiers, the German offi cials who were wear
ing uniforms were in charge of the place 
where the Jews worked. So, they would come  and look around and change workers and 
stuff like that. Those were the people thataccepted all sorts of bribes, you know, to take  

some body t o work or to change his job, you know, 
what it was. So, they used to come  to 
the, for conferences, to the Judenrat, but it wa
sn™t a conference. They
 had to be prepared 
with bribes. There was another one. I 
think I gave you all the name s already. 
 
Q: Can I ask you some thing?  I think mo st peopl
e assu me that Judenrat
 was a function inside 
a ghetto, as opposed to a labor camp. Wa s this
 camp some how in between being a labor 
camp and a ghetto?  
 
A: No, that was the labor camp, and those pe
ople we re - ma ybe the Judenrat was the same 
people who were in the ghetto. The same as th
ey took me  and my father because we were 
in 
Arbeitsamt
, ma ybe that™s why we got into the o
ffice. Otherwise, I mean, I don™t know 
how we could get into the office if they di
dn™t see us writing there and keeping records. 
 
Q: Was you in some what of a privileged position because of the job?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were not?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So,whatever– 
 
A: I slept in the same  barrack, and I wasn™t in
 any privileged position 
at - they never spoke 
to me , nobody except for my boss, that Vaschek 
(ph). He was the only one that talked to 
me ; otherwise, nobody else talked to me  ever. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
34 
 
Q: Did you actually have conversations with Vaschek (ph)?  
 
A: No, because he had such a foul mout h, I was afraid to, I mean, I wasn™t afraid of him, but 
I just couldn™t take the wa y he - I mean, he 
didn™t mi streat me , but 
he called me  all sorts 
of na me s, but it wasn™t only to me . He did 
that to everybody. But that was only words. 
That™s why I say he had heart, because some times there were a few cases when I was 
saved because of him, because he sent me  to the factory to work, to type  letters, and type 
lists where they had - when they had some  kind of action. I only think like that because 

on two occasions, I was sent to the factory du
ring selection, and the first time I thought I 
was lucky, but the second time, I thought 
ma ybe Vaschek (ph) did that. Although he 
talked to me  so badly, but I 
didn™t care. It was a good job. 
 
Q: So, how regularly were there selec
tions? Was it regular or was it just–?  
 
A: No, only some ti me s, and the selections we
re only when people were sick. So, I™ll tell you 
those stor ies separately because it was ve
ry important how they were treating it. 
 
Q: So, you™re now in this - are you with Renia or with your father?  
 
A: No, my father and Krysia we
re in - on Majowka, and Reni
a and I were there for awhile, 
and then later - I don™t - this I don™t reme
mber exactly how it happened, because they 
brought all the people from Majowka to Strzelni
ca and then from Strzelnica to Majowka. 
You know, it was, I don™t reme mber exactly what time and when, but Strzelnica was the 
bigger camp , the bigger camp, but then later we
 were all mo ved to Majowka. At first, 
because for a time I was with my father and Krysia, and for a time I was away from them. 
I don™t really reme mber when it was, what year 
it was, because I™m sure that Krysia must 
have been - they must have taken them from
 Strzelnica to Majowk
a maybe first and then 
to - they ma de one camp at a certain time, ma
ybe  for repairs or for other things, I couldn™t 
tell you. 
 
Q: But, when you went to Majowka, is Majo
wka larger than 500 people or was it was still 
only 500 people?  
 
A: Five hundred people, but ma ybe they - ma ybe
 they enlarged it meanwhile, because, you 
know, later on they were taking us, towards th
e end - towards the end, we were taken to 
another camp altogether. They were building a 
special camp for us, just to get rid of us, 
because it was near a train line. 
 
Q: Can you give us some  idea of what these camps looked like? 
 
A: Yes. When you walked in, there was a gate
 and there was a tower. The Ukrainian was on 
the tower with a gun. The Ukrainian that was at
 the gate also had 
a gun - did he have a 
gun or one of those sticks?  And, the office in St
rzelnica was almost close to the gate, like, 
you walked and that was - such a barrack was 
an office, and then, I reme mber, there was 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
35 
 
a kitchen there further away, where they 
were cooking the soup, and you would have to 
line up for the soup right away. And there wa
s a laundry where Renia later worked. She 
worked in a laundry, and then there were the 
barracks. The barracks were separate from 
the me n and separate for the wome n, and 
I don™t reme mber how many of the barracks 
were there, but we slept two on one cot, and– 
 
Q: And, where these buildings brick?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Wood?  
 
A: Wood. 
 
Q: And, were they ma de specially?  
 
A: I suppose they had - there was no camps before
, so they must have ma de them specially 
when we were in ghettos, because 
there were no camps there before. 
 
Q: And how terrible were the 
conditions?  I mean, wa s there a
ny water running?  Where was 
the latrines, if there were latrines? 
 
A: There were latrines and there were show
ers, but you k now what
? I don™t reme mber. I 
really, like, I was thinking the other night, ﬁW
here did we eat? ﬂ  Because I reme mber that 
we lined up for food. We lined up for food - for soup. That was the ma in meal. The 
people that worked in the factories got their 
meal, but the people that were on shifts, and 
the people that worked in camp ate - we had to line up for the soup and line-up for the 

bread. But, if you ask me where did we eat?  Did 
we eat - it wasn™t a dining room - but in 
a big room or whether we  eat in our ba
rracks?  You know, I couldn™t remember. I was 
trying to think, ﬁHow did 
we eat? ﬂ  I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: Did you eat outside? 
 
A: I don™t - I don™t remembe r , lik
e, I don™t think that we woul
d sit outside and eat. So, we 
must have eaten some where, but where?  Ma
ybe there was a room behind the kitchen, but 
I couldn™t tell you. I forgot. 
 
Q: Did you carry bowls or did they hand them out to you?  
 
A: No, we had such me tal dishes that they we
re - because they served the soup and you left 
your dish there later. But it wasn™t - in
 concentration camp we  had me tal kind of 
manashki 
(ph), we called it, and with the handles 
so we could put it on a string and carry 
it all the time.

Q: I think we probably have to stop the tape
 now, am I right?  Two mi nutes, all right then 
let™s stop. 
 
A: Then we™ll have lunch?  
 
Q: We have lunch?  I don™t know.

Tape #5
 
 
Q: Hania, I know that you can™t reme mb er wher
e you ate, but can you describe the process 
of getting food and the container in which 
you got food and if you had a utensil, and 
describe the food if you can. 
 
A: Okay, there was - there was a kitchen and so
me  of the people worked
 in the kitchen, and 
one of them was Salka Perinsweic (ph). She 
was in charge of the kitchen, if that™s 
important. Every noon - or the main meal - I 
don™t know if it was at twelve or at two 
o™clock, or whatever - the ma in me a l  we w
ould get soup and we had to all line up for the 
soup. The workers that went to the factories we
re getting their ma in ma il in the factories. 
So, there weren™t that ma ny people, only the 
workers inside, the peopl
e that weren™t well, 
and the people that didn™t go to work that da
y or whatever. So, but she would - there were 
some  me tal plates painted wh
ite. We would line up, get th
e food, and I™m sorry I don™t 
reme mber where we ate, whether we took it 
to the barrack, whether we ate outside. I 

don™t reme mber any rooms that would be availabl
e for us to sit down at
 the table. I don™t 
reme mber. Maybe there were. I couldn™t really
 tell you. Then we woul
d get bread in the 
morning, I think. Each time, we had to lin
e-up, but food, like, the morning breakfast 
wasn™t so important because many times theworkers that  went to the factories were 
buying somehow or exchanging things with th
e Polacks and were br
inging home  some 
bread and some  other stuff. 
 
Q: What was the soup ma de  of?  
 
A: The soup, potato soup, I reme mb
er. I don™t really reme mber 
exactly, but whatever they 
had, they put in this pot, and that was the soup for the - that wa s our dinner for the day. 
 
Q: And, do you reme mber how about how ma ny pe
ople were being fed like this?  I mean, 
were there a lot of people working in the kitchen. 
 
A: A few peopl e. 
 
Q: Afew. 
 
A: A few peopl e. I would say that at least ha
lf of them, because don™t forget that we had 
shift work, that some  people were going to 
work at night, in 
the evening, I don™t know 
whether we had three shifts, I think. So, they
 were getting food at the factory or on the 
premises, but this Salka Perinsweic (ph) was,
 she was one of the inma tes as I call it. She 
was in charge of the kitchen. That was her job. 
 
Q: And it was a big job. 
 
A: Yeah, a big job. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
38 
 
Q: Do you remember being very hungry?  
 
A: Not in labor camp. You know 
that I really don™t reme mber
 being so very hungry. That 
means that we must have had - we didn™t ha
ve any fancy food. We  
didn™t have - we had 
bread and soup, but ma ybe we were allowed to
 eat as much as we could. I couldn™t, I 
don™t remember. I remember being very, ve
ry hungry in the c
oncentration camp, but 
ma ybe because in concentration camp it was - 
it was, I mean, we were almost dying from 
hunger that - that the camp in Starac
howice was already like a restaurant. 
 
Q: So, I guess as you progress for deprivation, 
you reme mber the least 
bad as being not so 
bad some how. 
 
A: That™s true. I just don
™t reme mber those things. 
 
Q: Did you have an evening meal?  
 
A: Idon™tremember. 
 
Q: You don™t reme mber. Tell me something about
 what your day would be like. How early 
would you get up in order to go to the office?  
 
A: I would go very early because 
the first shift, if the shift wa
s going, I had to give them the 
work list. I had to prepare it for them. So, if 
they went to work at seven o™clock, I had to 
be there, and I worked until the last shift would go to work and Vaschek (ph) - before 
Vaschek (ph) would go home  and put a
ll the records under the lock and key. 
 
Q: Did you ma ke up the work lists or did 
Vaschek (ph) tell you who would be on it?  
 
A: No, I was told either by the 
policemen or like, I was, if th
ere was any changes. If the list 
was the same, I didn™t have to change it. I 
just - because I got re
ports that would say, 
ﬁThis was transferred to here.ﬂ So, I knew that
 the next day, I™d have to put this name  on 
another list. And I had to adjust
 the cards, as well. I had to write on it, let™s say if she 
worked, if he worked in Departme nt A, as 
an example, I™m just saying. So, if he was 
changed to C, I had to put it on his card too. 
 
Q: So, everybody in the camp had a kind of identity card. 
 
A: Yes, in the inside office.
 They didn™t carry any cards. 
 
Q: And how big were these cards?  
 
A: Pardonme ?  
 
Q: Howbig?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
39 
 
 
A: They were small cards because all we  had was the name , as I told you, the birth da te, the 
barrack number where they lived or  sl ept, 
and the departme nt where they work, and a 
place whether he™s still alive or  dead. 
 
Q: Now, did you type these lists?  
 
A: First, we didn™t have like a 
typewriter in camp at first. S
o, if he wanted typed lists or 
some thing, he would send me  to the factory, 
Vaschek (ph) would. But, if - but I had a 
very good handwriting, very legible, I reme mber
, and that™s why he took me  to his place, 
because he could read so easily my writi
ng, and I was doing it all by hand. Later on, I 
reme mber, I don™t know when, he brought a typewr
iter, an old typewriter, to the office. 
 
Q: Didyou–? 
 
A: I didn™t know how to type, but I pretended. I 
said, ﬁ With two fingers, I type so fast.ﬂ I 
learned so fast. I never learned how to type. 
So, when he asked me  if I could type, I had 
to say yes. I mean, otherwise he™ll take so
me body else to the office. That was a good job. 
So, I typed with my fingers and I 
learned to type so fast that I was faster than the ot hers - 
to such a degree that, in my office later,
 when I worked for ourselves, I took typing 
classes and I could never learn because I wa
s mu ch faster with two fingers, the way I 
learned in camp. 
 
Q: And did you print when you were not us
ing the typewriter or did you handwrite?  
 
A: No, I didn™t print, I wrote, but my le
tters were like printing. They were like 
calligraphically. Like, I had a very good 
handwriting. You wouldn™t believe when you 
see how I sign my na me  now, with my eyes. 
 
Q: And how many people workedin the same  office with you?  
 
A: Three people. There was one girl that cleaned
 the offi ce. She™s still alive. She lives in 
Toronto. And there was one seamstress. She actua
lly - he hired her as a helper to the - 
when I say he, I mean Vaschek (ph) because he 
wa s in charge of this office - he hired he r 
to help the ot her gi rl to br ing wood and st
uff. We  had a fireplace. There was no heating 
there. So, there was such a 
fireplace and the girls had to bring wood, chop wood, they had 
to do all this. So, he hired her, but since she 
was a seamstress, Mrs. Vasche k (ph) used to 
come very often to the office just to visit because  this third gi rl was se wing dresses for 
her. So, she would bring ma terials and she 
would sit there, she would try on, and she 
would - so, actually officially she wa s a help
er to the cleaner, but in reality, she was a 
seamstress that sewed dresses. I don™t reme mber because there was - I don™t remember a 
sewing ma c hine there. So, unless he provide
d a sewing machine, I don™t reme mber, but 
she ma de many dresses for her. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
40 
 
Q: What was Vaschek™s (ph) wife like?  
 
A: She was a very quiet woma n, Ger man, tall 
like him or maybe a littl
e bit shorter because 
he was extremely tall, and she was slim and 
she was a very pretty woma n, and she was 
very nice to us. I mean, she didn™t talk with 
the other people, but if she would come  to the 
office, she would say hello to me . She would 
say hello to the seam
stress. She would say 
hello to the other gi rl that cleaned the place.
 She was very nice. She used to come  quite 
often because she - I don™t know where she got al
l those ma terials. So, that girl sewed for 
her. 
 
Q: So, was your work da
y like nine, ten hours?  
 
A: Yes, as long as people we re going out and co
mi ng in, until the last shift we nt to work, I 
had to be at the office, to give 
them the list and then I went home . 
 
Q: So, your day– 
 
A: And some times Vaschek (ph) wouldn™t be 
there so long. I mean, he would be working 
ma ybe eight hours or seven or six, but I had to
 be in the office. But when he left, he 
locked all his - I had no access to the papers
 anymore, but the list were pr epared in 
advance, so the lists that I was givi
ng out before they went to work. 
 
Q: So, all day long you were doing 
lists and changing the things. 
 
A: I kept all kinds of records, like, when I say 
all kinds of records- th
ey brought in, let™s say 
if there was a delivery of clot
hes and we were giving the cl
othes out. So, I would say - I 
wouldn™t, let™s say, tell them what™s going - 
we got a shipme nt of clothes and it came on 
such and such a date, and we gave them out
 on such and such a date. And, if the other 
supplies would come  or whatever, like, some
body had to keep records of those things. 
 
Q: So, you really were the reco
rd keeper of the whole camp?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Of these two camps? 
 
A: Right, in one camp, but later on when they put
 us together, my father worked with me . 
Krysia told me that in Majowka she was help
ing father in the office, but I couldn™t tell 
you because when my fa ther was transferred to Majowka and I was transferred to 
Strzelnica, for a long time, I didn™t have any 
contact with them, until we came together. 
But I reme mber when I had typhoid, I think Kr
ysia was there with me . I think so, but I 
don™t remember. 
 
Q: Was it typhoid or typhus?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
41 
 
 
A: Typhus, but isn™t it called typhoid in English?  
 
Q: No, I think they™re two different diseases. 
 
A: I see, because  we had what they called - 
it wasn™t connected with the stomach. It was– 
 
Q: Spotted. 
 
A: Spotted. It™s called typhus, right? Okay. 
 
Q: I™ll have to look it up. I™m not– 
 
A: We called it 
tiphus
. 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: So, I think I told some one typhus and he said, ﬁNo, typhoid.ﬂ So, I say typhoid. 
 
Q: Now, tell me some thing, were people comi ng in
to your office to talk with you or to find 
out information?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No. 
 
A: I wasn™t such a big wheel. The Judenrat 
was deciding, you know, they 
were - I was just - 
I was just wr iting and typing and stuff like th
at. But I™ll tell you that people liked me  a 
lot, because I reme mber once when I wasdistributing clothes and, you know, I was so 
straightforward, I was transparent. So, I st
arted giving clothes a
nd people were grabbing 
and they started taking like instead of one shir
t or whatever T-shirt,
 they would grab from 
my hands and run. So, you know, I started cr
ying. I said, ﬁWhat do you want from my 
life?  I have so ma ny I have to give and 
get to everybody.ﬂ I star
ted crying. So, some  
people who stood in line were chasing those 
other people to take it away, to help me  
because they were sorry for me  because, you 
know, I would like to give them three or 
four of the m, but, I mean, I only had a limite
d amount. So, I must say that people alwa ys 
helped me . 
 
Q: It™s very interesting that
 you would cry at that mome nt. 
 
A: Yeah, I was crying because you know why?  
 
Q: Why?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
42 
 
A: I was crying because I felt that, because of t
hose few pigs that want to gr ab all this, the 
people at the end won™t ge t nothi ng, will get not
hi ng. So, I felt sorry for them. I started 
crying and I reme mber they ran 
them and chase the down the guys. 
 
Q: Did you see a lot of that
 kind of behavior, people– 
 
A: Yeah, people were grabby, people were, 
you know, but, you know, this was life like - it 
was hard. It wasn™t as hard, in comparison to
 concentration camps, it was a picnic, but it 
was still hard because we  were still treated like animals. 
 
Q: Why do you think that you 
and your sisters rema ined–?  
You didn™t do that. You kept 
wanting to be fair. 
 
A: You know, we were fair and because of that 
we really - we really always had protectors. 
I™ll tell you later stories about
 Auschwitz, how we rema ined alive because we kept 
ourselves together and how people were help
ing us, people that we
re in charge of 
some thing. They would pick us because they felt sorry for us - more sorry for us because 
we didn™t fight, like we didn™t - we didn™t figh
t for food or grab it or anything like that. 
We wanted to be fair. We
 were brought up that way. 
 
Q: All right, let™s get back to some  of 
the - let me  ask you, did you know the people on the 
Judenrat? 
 
A: All of them, because they were from Wi
erzbnik. One was the father of our very good 
friend, Krysia knows - Krysia and my friend, 
Mr. Minzberg (ph). He
 was a very well-
known ma n in Wi erzbnik. They were once very 
rich, but at the time when we me t them, 
they had some  kind of possessions, lots 
of land, landowners, bankers, who knows?  Like, 

his predecessor. At that time  when we knew 
them, they were just like any others. There 
were no rich people in Wi erzbnik, but they we
re very well-known and very respected. He 
was very well known and very respected pers
on, and although he belonged to the Zionist 
organization, he was also very religious. Bu
t he was - we didn™t have a synagogue. We  
used the school the Tarbut school we used fo
r prayers, and he was - he was the one that 
prayed like he was religious. Another one wa
s Minzburg (ph). Einisema nn (ph) was just a 
shoema ker, but he was a very simple ma n, 
but he was a good ma n. So, they have chosen 
him because he was also - he tried to be fa
ir. Then there was Mr. Wolfowicz (ph) . They 
had the store, like in Wi e r zbnik; they had the 
store ma terials, sewing 
ma terials. He wasn™t 
that pleasant, but he was good at
 giving orders and stuff like that. He wasn™t as pleasant, 
as ma tter of fact, he was a little mean, but 
he was good if people refu
sed to do things, you 
know, that they sent. Then, there was–Mi
nzberg (ph), Wolfowicz (ph)–Wirenswiec 
(ph), Wi renswiec was - they had a - they had 
a liquor store, I mean, 
not a liquor store, a 
liquor restaurant or whatever
 you call it, a bar. And, you 
know, in Starachowice because 
the Polacks, the mi nute - the mi nute they fini
shed work, they got their pay they were 
going to drink vodka. So, he was quite well off,
 and he was okay. So, those were the four. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
43 
 
Q: So, it™s a small group. 
 
A: A s mall group. 
 
Q: And, what did you think of these folks and what they did?  
 
A: They - we had to have them, because othe
rwise the German would run it. So, they were 
running the - they were under 
Vaschek (ph). Wh at I mean under Vaschek (ph), Vaschek 
(ph) supervised their work, that let™s say if 
we needed supplies or some thing, they had to 
tell Vaschek (ph) and he woul
d do those things or whatever, 
but they were trying the best 
they could for the people in the camp. So, as
 I said, supplies and what else would they 
do?  Order and complaints, you know, I mean, wh
en they didn™t want to sleep with one 
another, because there we re two people to 
a cot. So, you know, they would solve all the 
problems, inside problems. 
 
Q: Was there so mething like a court? 
 
A: There was, but they had not
hing to say. They weren™t - I m
ean their orders were what?  
People didn™t listen to them. Bu
t they didn™t go and squeal to
 Vaschek (ph), they had to 
settle it, but they didn™t have very much - th
ey didn™t have very much power. The same  as 
Adash™s, my  husband™s father. He was in charge
 of the police. He didn™t have that much 
power. I me an, I saw how they - how the Ge
rmans were almost murdering him, giving 
him orders. So, he screened and he did what
 he could, but, I mean, his power was limited.  
 
Q: So, what would happen if some one rea
lly was committing a cr ime? I don™t  mean a 
German defi nition. 
 
A: No, no, no, no - we would keep it quie
t. Nobody would - nobody would squeal to the 
Germans, unless the Germans would find it out
 some where else . Like
, we were always 
protect - when I say we, there was Judenrat 
and the police - they were always protecting 
the people. On the outside they 
had to - on the outside they ha
d to pretend that they are - 
that they are solving all the problems. 
 
Q: So, you really didn™t have 
anyone in those positions who you thought were betraying the 
Jews and trying to protect themselves. 
 
A: No, it was - how could they protect themselves
?  They were in the same  shoes. I me an, the 
policemen were - when we planned the upris
ing, all those strong 
people and the people 
would only keep a secret, because you couldn™t tell everybody - but the policemen were 
essential because they we re all strong young me
n. So, when we were planning the - this - 
not the– 
 
Q: Thebreakout?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
44 
 
A: –the breakup–out, the policemen were influe
ntial. They were organizing it. They were 
organizing the break. 
 
Q: When did you meet Adrian?  
 
A: I knew Adrian all my life, because he  come s 
from the same  town, but I had - when I went 
to Radom, I didn™t see him - I saw him in cam
p, but at that time , I had another boyfriend. 
So, actually I didn™t identify with him. Firs
tly, because they were the or thodox people. 
 
Q: Adrianwas? 
 
A: Adrian was, like his father, he wasn™t
, but his father was orthodox people. Secondly, 
since they were religious, they
 didn™t mi x with the Zionists 
because they didn™t believe in 
Zionism. So, the groups were 
divided, you know. So, my mo ther - I always laugh when I 
say this, what would she call me ?  Genius. I 
had to have a doctor for a husband, otherwise 
she wouldn™t accept him. So– 
 
Q: So, that™s why you were da
ting this me dical student?  
 
A: Yeah, she was so happy because he was, you 
know, that was a real find. She could tell all 
her friends her daughter is going with a me dical student. But then, I me t him after the 
war, because I reme mber he helped us a lo
t, be cause we came to Lodz. We couldn™t go 
anywhere. All the Jews went to Lodz after th
e war. They had a Judenrat there. So, we 
heard that his fa mily lives there because hewas in the partisan groups, and for him, the 
war ended in January. For us, we didn™t come  until June . So, he already had his own 
apartment, and so when we came, he  said he would do anything for us. He found us. First 
of all, he asked us what we wanted to do. S
o, I wanted to go back to school. So, he found 
- he regi st-– because he was the bi g shot. 
He was at that time a Polish officer. So, he 
arranged for me  this school, lik
e, found this school that was for gifted people that was in 
a half a year you could do a year. So, he found 
this school and he regi
stered me  there.He 
found me  a job, and he found us an apartment,
 and that™s how we started going, and he 
was sending me  flowers every day to the o
ffice, to the house. That™s how it started. 
 
Q: So, you weren™t very close in the camp. You just knew him.  
 
A: I talked to him because we had a lot to 
do together, not only with him, wi th all the 
policemen, because they were comi ng to the 
office every mi nute for whatever list they 
needed or whatever order they needed, they had to come  to the office. 
 
Q: So, he was one of the policemen whose father was the head of the police. 
 
A: Right. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
45 
 
Q: I see. So, you™re 18 in 1942 through this pe
riod. This is one of the worst years. Probably 
more Jews are killed in 
1942 than any other year. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Do you - are you hearing rumors from outside and–?  
 
A: I™ll tell you what I heard als
o. My boyfriend got killed in such a ma nner. He was working 
as a chauffeur for the Germans. I mentioned 
that to you before. And the Germans we re so 
good to him because hi s boss was also a me dical
 student. So, they had a lot in common 
and they really liked him, and they pick
ed him up at the time from Wi erzbnik - my 
boyfriend with his boss. They gave
 me  all - they treated me  as
 if I was - as if I wasn™t 
Jewish. And I reme mber, one of them, his bo
ss went home, so he asked - my boyfriend 
asked him at the time  to buy me  a raincoat. He
 bought me  the most b
eautiful raincoat - of 
course, my boyfriend paid for it. And then 
Busko was liquidated be
fore Starachowice, 
and they send them all to Treblinka, the whole family. He wa s the only one who survived 
Treblinka  and broke out of Treblinka. How?  
Because when he came, they were looking 
for truck drivers. So, since he was a ch
auffeur for the Germans, he had very good 
credentials. So, they picked, 
they took him. So, I heard the story from some body else, 

because I never saw him again. I™ll tell you late
r, but they said he was a truc k driver. 
Whatever he was doing, he was going outside with the Germans. Apparently - he was 
driving - apparently, at one time - he was a 
strong and tall ma n - apparently, he killed a 
German that he was driving and he ran awa
y. And, when he ran away, he went back to 
Busko because they were quite wealthy people.
 They had all those hotels at the time. So, 
he figured that when he goes to his friend, hi
s boss that he  will help hi m - he will help 
him. Meanwhile - and I™ll tell you how I found ou
t about that, too - so, he went to Busko 
and he registered with his boss. He told him 
how he ran away. He mo
st likely didn™t tell 
him that he killed a German, and - and the 
guy said to him that he should show him 
where the family wealth is. They had mone
y, like gold and rings and jewelry, and hidden 
some where on the property. So, he went with him and he showed it to him and he gave it 
to him, and the German killed him right on th
e spot. I found it out from a girl - like we 
had– 
 
Q: Wait a second, I think we  have to stop at 
this point. We  don™t?  All right, then, continue 
 
A: So, I™ll just tell you how I f
ound it out. We  had an address. He gave me  an address. He 
had the Paliszewskis™ and he gave me an addres
s from a girl that - to write her if I ever 
want to get in touch with him, because it 
was before the - it was 1940 or ™41. So, of 
course, after the war, I wr ote the girl and sh
e wrote me  and told me  the whole story. His 
boss killed him for the money. 
 
Q: Okay, we™ll take a break and change. 
 
A: Okay.

Q: Boy, that™s quite a story.

Tape #6
 
 
Q: Tell me  wha t  your relationship was like 
with the sisters now. 
Are things changing?  
You™re now 18 years old, and Renia is 13, a
nd Chris is 16. Do you have roles with each 
other?  
 
A: No, never. We were always - we tried 
to be always together, because we knew if 
some thing happens to one of us - like, we tr
ied to keep together to defend one another. 
So, in camp, actually, we slept 
together in one barrack. We  we nt most - in our free time 
we spent together, protecting each other. 
Renia wa s always scared. She was always 
sickly, I me an, a little bit sick, and she wa
s always cold. She had to have - she was 
wearing all kinds of covers not 
to shiver. So, Renia was really - we had to take care of 
her. 
 
Q: Did you ever have conflicts with each other?  
 
A: Not really. I mean, not really conflicts. As I 
said - as my sister tell
s me  now, I™d give her 
a punch here and there because her closet 
was better organi zed than mi ne or, you know, 
but it wasn™t important really. We  always kept together. 
 
Q: And, how do you reme mber your father du
ring this period?  Do
 you now, after the– 
 
A: My father - I will tell you, my father was, 
when he lost hi s wife , he was very much to 
himself. He was working in the office 
and - I don™t reme mbe r  going to him and 
complaining to him like I would to my moth
er or looking for protection of any sort 
because he was - he wasn™t the way he was 
at ho me . He was a broken-down ma n. But, of 
course, we cared for him and we talked to hi
m, but not the same  way as to our mother. 
 
Q: So, that would have been true even if your mother had been there. 
 
A: Actually, ma ybe not to such a degree becau
se he didn™t take an active part, you know, in 
our when we were growing up. Like, I couldn™t go to tell him and tell
 him a story that I 
found a boyfriend or something, th
at I had a good time. I™ll tell it to my mo ther. But if I 
had a report card, I would run to show 
it to him so he could be proud of it. 
 
Q: Do you think he knew that your mother was dead?  
 
A: Mostdefinitely. 
 
Q: At that point?  
 
A: Defi nitely.Defi nitely. 
 
Q: And you?  When did you think you–?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
48 
 
 
A: I thought to myself at one time at the cam
p. I don™t know whether it was to ma ke us mad 
or whatever, one Ukrainian came in to the offi
ce once and told me that he saw my mo ther 
in a camp some where, that she™s alive. So, we 
wanted to believe that that™s true. But on 
the other hand, if my 
mother was alive, she would have - and she knew that such and 
such Ukrainian, I mean, how would he know th
at she was my mother, but if she knew, 
she would have written on a newspaper or 
some thing - she would send some  kind of a  
sign, but how could she?  They took them all,
 and then later afte
r the war we found out 
that everyone from Wi erzbnik went to Treblin
ka and they were - th
ey were right away 
killed ther e. So, it was impossible that my mo
the r  survived the war. Why did he come  to 
the office just and told me
 that?  I couldn™t tell you. 
 
Q: Did you believe him then?  
 
A: At the time , I didn™t know whether to belie
ve him. I told my  sisters about it and we 
wanted - when you want to believe, you be
lieve. But, then we knew it™s impossible. 
Maybe he made a mi stake. How did he know 
that she was my mother?  How did he know 
that, I mean, he didn™t know us. It was a stra
nge Ukrainian. It wasn™t
 one of the guards. 
How did he come  there to tell us?  I don™t know. 
 
Q: And did you see your father de
teriorating during this period?  
 
A: Yes. He was - he wasn™t as energe tic as he
 used to be, because  he was very energetic and 
he was very resourceful and he
 wasn™t. He was kept to hims e l f, going to the office. He 
was working there, and that™s all. 
 
Q: So, that must have been very upsetting to you. 
 
A: Yes, very upsetting, yeah. But he still 
lived long enough to go to Auschwitz, where he 
perished. 
 
Q: I guess deterioration some times takes a long time . 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you get very sick with typhus?  
 
A: Verysick. 
 
Q: Were you the first of the three? 
 
A: I was one of the first ones.
 I don™t reme mber. Renia says 
that one of them recovered 
before I, but I - I don™t reme mber whether Reni
a or Krysia told me that I was really very 
sick, that I had a very high temperature and 
I was talking nonsense
. I was delirious. But 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
49 
 
once, when you were sick, like when you had typ
hus - first of all, when you had this high 
fever, this very high fever, you burned like 
anything, and even if you were delirious and 
you were contagious, you weren™t as sick as 
during the crisis - when the crisis came , 
when your temperature went right down, 
you couldn™t move, and this was - if you 
survived the crisis, you lived. Otherwise - a
nd then you, after a while, you were yourself, 
but a lot of people didn™t surviv
e the cr isis, and that  was the time that I want to tell you 
about Sulamite (ph). Because that was when
 typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick. 
The Germans decided they™d have to kill off 
the people that ar e sick. So, what they did, 
the decided, the army came in. It was as they 
- it wasn™t - it wasn™t because they needed 
soldiers to put all the si ck ones on the truck to
 take them out. So, what they did, they told 
the policemen that everybody had to come  out 
of the barracks, whether he was sick or 
healthy, and the Germans were watching them 
and asked them to run. Whoever could run 
- the sick ones with the fever could run - 
but the ones that were 
just going through the 
crisis, they couldn™t. So, those were put on 
the truc k, and they called me  fr om the office 
to write down the name s of the people that we
re going on the trucks. 
Also, at that time , 
every policeman was - every policeman was 
responsible for a group, for a few barracks 
or one barrack, I forget how it was, but the po
licemen were responsible that everyone that 
was in the ba rrack came out. So, at that ti
me , I reme mber, my  sister-in-law, like my 
husband™s sister™s husband was also a polic
eman, he hid somebody there and covered 
because they person coul dn™t walk. So, later 
after what happened when they found the 
sick one there covered, you know, and very si
ck, they killed the policema n. Cogord (ph) 
was killed right on the spot. Then, as I 
was writing the name s - I had two very good 
friends from Lodz, two very intelligent, beauti
ful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they 
were twins, but they were always together. 
One™s name  was Sulamite (ph), and the other 
Mira (ph). One went through quickly, like 
she ran through, and this Sulami te (ph) 
couldn™t run, she just - because the reason for 
it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he 
sent her to, for me  to write her name  down. S
o, I thought that they will take her to the 
truck. So, I asked - I didn™t know those peopl
e because they came  especially for that 
function. They were Becker™s people
. You know, Becker was outside the 
Lagers
. 
Sicherheit Polizei
 or whatever you call it - 
Si cherheit Deist
, I think they were called. So, 
those people were assigned this function. So, 
I said to the guy that was standing near me , 
ﬁPlease leave her. She™s my best friend.ﬂ S
o, he says, ﬁOh, she is, eh?ﬂ He took out the 
gun and killed her right in my presence. So, I 
reme mber that - I didn
™t reme mber - I don™t 
reme mber what happened to me because I fain
ted, but the policemen later told me they 
got me  quickly off my j ob, put me  in the 
police barracks, covere
d me there, and the 
policeman was writing down the name s a fter late
r. So, that was very trauma tic to me  
because I saw it with my  own eye. I mean, it wa
sn™t her fault. She was sick, and all I di d, 
I felt - I felt guilty because I told him she wa
s my  friend, but I thought that if I would tell 
him that she was friend, that he would sp
are her life, but he just killed her. 
 
Q: So, in some  sense, you think you™re responsible for that?  
 
A: I felt that - I thought that 
ma ybe if I would have leaved her or some thing, but I said, 
ﬁShe™s my best friend, please leave he
r. Let her go.ﬂ So, he killed her. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
50 
 
 
Q: Was that the fi rst time y
ou saw anything quite like that? 
 
A: No, things happened before when Altov (
ph) was killing. I reme mber, one day he ma de 
one Jew dance, like, I don™t know, he - he - a
nd he killed him there, and then I watched 
from the offi ce window when he killed him, 
they called the Ukrainian to take him awa y, 
so the Ukrainian caught him by the legs, and 
the camp was full of sand or some thing. So, 
he was dragging - not dragging, running with hi
m, wherever they told him to take him,  
and you know all this sand was - how should I sa
y - covering the face of this Jewish ma n. 
So, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody 
looked, but when he came  and he
 always killed a few people. 
 
Q: What sort of affect does this have on you?
 Do you stop feeling th
ings?  I mean, as you 
start seeing so much brutality, what–?  
 
A: Well, it was traumatic. It was traumatic, ve
ry trauma tic, and it ma de us cry, but we 
couldn™t help it. I mean, we got so used to it 
that at night, when we were in the barrack, 
we sang. Like, we would always, there were songs - special camp songs. They were 
different from the songs that we sang in
 the past. Today™s you
r turn and tomorrow™s 
going to be our turn. So, we never knew whos
e turn it was going to be. So, we really 
didn™t care. We wanted to live - 
life, the will for life was very
 strong, but not to a point to, 
you know, to such - because we knew that toda
y™s their turn, and tomorrow™s going to be 
ours. 
 
Q: Tell me  something. I don™t know whether 
you know this, when you fainted, when your 
friend Sulamite (ph) was killed, and th
e police grabbed you and put you in the– 
 
A: TheJewishpolice. 
 
Q: Right, the Jewish 
police, I understand. 
 
A: They took me - the barrack was very close 
to where we were arriving, the police barrack. 
It wasn™t a barrack - it wasn™t my barrack. 
It was the police - you know
, they had their - if 
you want to call it office ther
e, and their beds there. 
 
Q: And, we - the security police didn™t stop them
. It didn™t ma tter that they took you away, I 
guess. 
 
A: That™s what they told me , because I fainte
d, but they told me that they grabbed me and 
they said, ﬁAh, she™s no good,ﬂ or whatever th
ey said, they took me
 to the barrack and 
one of the policemen took over. 
 
Q: How long were you in th
e police barrack?  Do you know?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
51 
 
A: After the finished with it all, the truck 
went away. I know - to 
tell you the truth, I know 
how they were killed because they we re ma
king all these graves outside the barrack. I 
don™t know how many people. I don™t reme mber b
ecause right after that, it was very bad 
when I had to put down ‚deceased™ for those people.  
 
Q: Does it take you a while to get 
over the death of Sulamite (ph)?  
 
A: Oh, yeah, until today I can™t forget it. 
 
Q: What was her last name ?  
 
A: Idon™tremember. 
 
Q: Sulamite(ph). 
 
A: Sulamite(ph). 
 
Q: FromLodz? 
 
A: From Lodz? They were Mira and Sulamite (
ph). Mira is still alive, but I don™t remember 
the name . They were from Lodz, and they 
were also teacher. They, you know, every girl 
that was in Wi erzbnik, like going back here, 
every girl that knew how to read was a 
teacher. 
 
Q: When people were shot, some  
people died of disease, right?  
 
A: Very few people. Typhus, typhus was the biggest killer. 
 
Q: Notstarvation?  
 
A: Not starvation. No, not in Starachowice, no. 
 
Q: And, every name  was given to you. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Even if Altov (ph) came in and shot some body. 
 
A: So, we took the card out and I 
would write down ﬁdeadﬂ, ﬁdeceasedﬂ. 
 
Q: And, who would tell you the name  of th
e person? Because Altov (ph) wouldn™t know 
who he™s killing. 
 
A: No, but the police– 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
52 
 
 
Q: Wouldknow?  
 
A: They would - you know, they were inside. I 
mean, they would report to me , so that we 
could take them off the list. And Vasche
k (ph), I mean, you know, he was there every 
day. 
 
Q: So, this was clearly th
e worst part of your job. 
 
A: Theworst. 
 
Q: To write down– 
 
A: To write down ‚deceased™, but if I didn™t know
 the people - I mean, I got so used to it 
because it ha ppened quite often, I would say. So, 
if I didn™t know the 
face of that person, 
it was just a name , it was different than when 
I had to write that Sulamite (ph) was dead. 
 
Q: Help me to understand something, because th
ere are people who, when you™re afraid, are 
you constantly afraid or does the terror go 
up and down?  Because you have to watch all 
the time , that™s clear. 
 
A: Allthetime. 
 
Q: Right?  So, is there a funny 
feeling in the pit of your–?  
 
A: I™m going to tell you some thing that I™m e m
barrassed to admit, but it™s true. I believed, 
although I was - I™m really a non-believer. In cam
p, I believed that God is taking care of 
me, that nothing could happen to me. I™m embarrassed to admit because I wasn™t 
religious and I didn™t earn this
 special privilege. But somehow - I even told my sisters 
during selections in Ausc hwitz, ﬁIf I™m sent there go after me, because God is watching 

over me.ﬂ Because you know like I went throug
h so much a nd nothing - I cannot say that 
nothing happened to me because all those in
cidents that I™m tell you about were very 
traumatic, but somehow I believed - I somehow
 believed in God, that he™s watching over 
me .  
 
Q: Where do you think that came from?  
 
A: I™ll tell you, I just don™t know
, because things happened to me many ti me s - like, things 
happening, like people were helping me . 
So, I thought that God sent them.  
 
Q: So, you mi ght be a believer in angels or some thing. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
53 
 
A: No, no, I didn™t believe in anything. But duri
ng the camp, I really and truly - and I said I 
didn™t earn this because  I wasn™t religious before
, and I wasn™t religious after, so I didn™t 
earn God™s special attention - but that™s w
hy I believe that he™s
 taking care of me . 
 
Q: Wereyou– 
 
A: Because I figured, how come  that I wasn™t 
in the marketplace when the things happened? 
How come  t he German that took me  hitchhik
ing didn™t kill me on the spot?  I mean, he 
didn™t even have to ma ke any excuses. How 
come he didn™t kill me then? And I had a lot 
of happenings that I™ll tell you 
later. How come  t hat nothing
–?  I mean, I was right there 
and some body - some body helped me. So, that™s
 why I believe that God is watching over 
me .  
 
Q: This is going to leap - ju
st for a second - leap forward and then we™ll go back. We re you 
with the Paliszewski when Chris was 
told about what your mother said. 
 
A: No, what happened - no, with Paliszewski I 
was there, but I will tell you that this goes 
already after the liberation. Si
nce you asked for Paliszewski, you know the Polacks killed 
those Einisema nn kids and Wolfowi cz™s kids, an
d we were in Stratachowice at the time . 
We came to visit the Paliszewskis. And that
 day when they killed the whole fa milies 
including the Einisema nns, the Wolfowiczs, togeth
er with the kids that  survived the war, 
being small kids like seven or nine or 
eight, you know. They knocked at the door at 
Paliszewski and they said - Polish partisan
s or who knows, Polish anti-Semites - they 
knocked at the door and they said to Palisze
wski, ﬁI know that La
ksuvnas (ph) are here, 
and we want them.ﬂ She wouldn™t let them ha
ve it - Krysia reme mbers that she said, ﬁI 
won™t let you have them.ﬂ But I reme mber 
that she said, ﬁWhat do you mean?  I wouldn™t 
keep Jewish people here.ﬂ I reme mber that wa
y, that she said that, 
that when they went 
away, like, they came to kill us. I mean, speci
fically they asked for us. The next morning, 
the husband of one of the Paliszewskis took us
 in a horse and wagon thing, covered us 
with straw and took us to another - to Skarzy
sko, which was a little 
bit further away, so 
that we can go to Lodz, that nobody will know 
that he™s he lping us. You asked for the 

Paliszewski story. 
 
Q: I was going to ask you another part of the story because what I heard from Chris was that 
your mother, the day before the liquidati
on of the ghetto, came to Paliszewski– 
 
A: No, my mother couldn™t have come  to 
Paliszewski. No, she couldn™t ha ve because she 
went to - before ma ybe she went. 
 
Q: No,before. 
 
A: Oh, yeah, before. Because  she™s was taken to Treblinka. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
54 
 
Q: But the day before or two days before or
 some thing, she came to give her some  things. 
And Chris said, this is what she heard, that 
your mother told her that  if only my three 
daughters will survive, I will give my  life. 
 
A: Yeah, she said that. She said
 that to me . She said in Jewi
sh, because she never spoke in 
Jewish to us. She always Polish, but she in Je
wish to me  that if you survive, I would like 
to be the 
or be n
 (ph), the sacrifice. That™s what - sh
e said it in Polish, but she used this 
Hebrew word.  
 
Q: She said this to you? 
 
A: To me . She says, ﬁI hope that
 three of - I want to be your 
orben 
(ph),ﬂ or whatever, like, 
she said it in Jewish. 
 
Q: What did that ma ke you feel?  
 
A: That means that I want to be victim, so 
that you can live. She said that to me , and she 
could™ve sa id it to Paliszewski because she could have - Paliszewskis™ was our point of 
meeting after the war. They were very good friend of ours. So, we always used to tell 
them everything.  
 
Q: That™s quite some thing for your mother to have said to you. 
 
A: Yeah, she said it to me. I reme mber it a
ll the time, and I never believed - that was a 
couple of days before, before the - I reme mber it. 
 
Q: So, who should we talk about?  Tobah (ph)?  
Adrian™s escape? Which do you want to start 
with? 
 
A: Because everything ha ppened the same  ti
me. So, maybe I™ll st art with Tobah (ph) 
because ma ybe it will be  shorter. I don™t know that much about her, but about my 
husband™s escape and the way that he bought th
e gun and stuff like that, it mi ght be a 
little longer. So, Tobah (ph) 
- one day Becker, who was the 
Si cherheit Deist
, came  in a 
car with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took 
her out of the camp. We  di
dn™t know why. Then, she came back. We  didn™t know why. 
Then, a few days later, he came for Tobah (
ph) again. Took her hims elf already. He took 
her out again. He was very polite. I reme mber 
because I was near the office, like they 
brought her to the office, and you know, I c
ould look through the window and see. He 
opened the door for her, like if she was - lik
e a girl, and he took her out and he brought 
her back the same  day. The third time, he took her out - I don™t know if it was a few days 

or a week or two later - he took her out and 
he never brought her back. Now, that day, he 
was ordered - her father was or
dered to, to dig a grave, and 
of course, it was like, they 
called him to work. He didn™t know it was going 
to be for him. So, he started digging but 
he was an older man. It took him a little time. 
So, Schrodt came  out of his office, and he 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
55 
 
took the gun and killed him on the spot. The 
grave wasn™t dug exactly - like, the grave 
was half-finished and he called other worker
s to cover him. And she never came back. 
Then we found out, because they were from
 Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40 
kilometers away from Wierzbnik. Apparentl
y, they had mone y - money or some  goods or 
some  jewelry. I don™t know. She mu st have 
showed it to them, and after they got 
whatever they wanted, you know, the money, th
ey just killed her. I didn™t know what 
happened to her because they didn™t br ing her 
to camp, but I was talking to the professor 
about her because he had - he had her - heard 
the story and his records. He told me  that 
he asked, whether he asked himself or whether 
one of those people that
 he - that he was 
talking to told him that she was - the grav
e was found later in the woods very close to 
where she lived - where they lived, where they
 found the treasures. So, this was Tobjah 
Weisblum ( ph) that™s how she perished, and her fa ther, for money. Not only because  they 
were Jews, but because  they had mo ney. 
 
Q: Why did they kill the fath
er, do you think, at the moment? 
 
A: Because I suppose they decided they didn™
t want  to have any witnesses because nobody 
knew why Tobjah We isblum (ph) wa s ta
ken out, nobody knew, and she never told 
anybody. 
 
Q: But the father knew?  
 
A: The father probably didn™t knew. 
 
Q: Didn™tknow?  
 
A: Didn™t know what for they are taking her out
. Because he was - when he was digging the 
grave, it was an older ma n as I say, he never 
suspected that that wa
s for him, but Schrodt 
killed him even before he finished. Li ke, 
he just killed him in front, like during the 
daytime, when everybody looked on. 
 
Q: Did you see that killing? 
 
A: No, I wasn™t near the grave then. No, but
 of course, I was the one that wrote down 
‚deceased™. 
 
Q: Okay, I think we™ll change the tape now.

Tape #7
 
 
Q: Hania, before we go onto the next story, I™m
 just wondering if you have a sense if there 
was different treatme nt of me
n and women. Was there anythi
ng about the wome n™s part 
of the camp that was di fferent then the men? 
We re wome n afraid of being mi streated as 
wome n, not just being br
utalized, but sexually?  
 
A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sa
crilege to talk to - not to talk to associ ate 
with any Jewish girl, because the Jews were
 not people. They were animals. So, you are 
talking about the people in the camp, the pe
ople that lived in camp or the Germans.  
 
Q: There are two sets of pos
sible relationships. One is 
between the prisoners, right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And, then there is between the guards. 
Now, there were Ukrainian guards, and I™m 
wondering, they didn™t have 
Ros Hashanda
 (ph). 
 
A: No, they didn™t have 
Ros Hashanda
 (ph). 
 
Q: So, they wouldn™t be necessarily– 
 
A: Well, they were - ma ybe they treated the 
wome n a little bit better,
 but I don™t think. When 
I say ﬁbetterﬂ, we have nothing to do with 
them, but ma ybe they wouldn™t push us or hit 
us or whatever, but I don™t th
ink the Ukrainians would dare, 
or whether they would dare 
or whether the Jewish girls would go
 with Ukrainians. I don™t think so. 
 
Q: Were wome n able to be in contact with me n in the camp?  
 
A: To a certain point. As a ma tter of fac t , 
certain name s ma ybe I  should me ntion, it must 
have been Mr. Billenswiec had a - because 
hi s wife was there, too - and everybody knew 
that he had a lover there, 
a woma n from Lodz, but that
 was - everybody knew about it, 
and - because  see the camp, the camp had sepa
rate barracks for wome n and separate for 
me n. So, if they me t together it must have 
been during the day some ti me , so the barrack 
was open for everybody to see. It wasn™t th
at they had separate rooms or anything, 
because we had - it was like a cot undernea
th and another one above. It was good for two 
people, but like people were saying, ﬁOh, this 
one or that one,ﬂ but
 that was about the 
inma tes. But you know people, I think that peop
le behaved a little better in camps. What I 
meant - I me an, there was nowhere to go, 
you had to do it - if you wanted to do it, 
everybody could watch. I don™t know how ma nypeople got into a barrack. I was asked 
the same  question by the historian. So I said, 
at night, the wome n were separated because, 
you know, there was no move me nt from one ba
rrack to another, but during the day, 
ma ybe.  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
57 
 
Q: Tell me , did you me nstruate in the camp. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Youdid?  
 
A: Not in Auschwitz, though. 
 
Q: But in Majowka. 
 
A: In Majowka and Strzelnica, yes. 
 
Q: How did you take care of yourself?  
 
A: You know, you™re asking me  questions, 
and I don™t know. I don™t reme mber. I don™t 
reme mber. I really don™t. We must have ha
d some way to do it, but I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: So, you were not starved enough so that
 you couldn™t get your period. Did wome n ge t 
pregnant in this camp?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No one got pregnant? 
 
A: No one. I don™t know of anybody. They would be
 afraid to get pregnant, I suppose. Even 
if they had a relationship with their husba
nd, there were husbands and wives there, but 
they were separated. And I, so I - to te
ll you the truth, I don™t reme mber having any 
problems with protecting - not protecting ourse lves, but keeping ourse
lves clean. I don™t 
r e me mb e r .  
 
Q: It is possible that some  wome n came 
i nto the camp pregnant, however, even–?  
 
A: No, there were some children in the camp 
that were already the children, not too ma ny. 
Einisema nn (ph) had his kids. Wolfowicz (ph) 
had his kids. Ve ra Veislava (ph) had a son, 
a young son, and he survived. She was from Lo
dz. There were several kids, but I would 
say not more than ten. 
 
Q: Shall we talk about the escape and th
e plans for the escape?  This is from 1943. 
 
A: Yes. So, what happened - the conditi
ons were worse and worse and, you know, when 
things were happening, a group of
 people decided that we have
 to ma ke an uprising and 
to liberate the camp. It was an idea that we
 didn™t know how to achieve it, but we knew 
one thing: that we have to get arms, some  
kinds of guns and stuff like that. And this was 
very secretive. All the policemen knew a
bout it, because they were young and strong 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
58 
 
people, and some  people, but you know, some  
people that belonged to the group or was 
told about it, but not everybody knew about the pr
eparations or  the intentions because we 
were afraid that we could be denounced and 
killed. So, anyway, we decided - everything 
was secret - and we decided that Adrian wa
s the best one to acqui
re - he volunteered 
because he was very good at schmoozing and ta
lking people into it. So, we decided he™s 
going to buy guns. We  would collect whatever 
we can from the Ukrainians because when 
they were going home, they had to give th
eir guns away and they went to get the guns 
when they came  back to work. They didn™t keep the guns with them. 
So, when they - that 
they were supposed to steal - the first gun 
was purchased, and my husband had it. He was 
the one to purchase this gun. 
 
Q: Where did he–?  
 
A: Where did he keep it?  I don™t know. 
 
Q: No, where did it get it from?  
 
A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. They pa
id for it through the nos
e with the collected, 
whatever we could collect. And he talked 
to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed 
that he would be selling guns for such and su
ch a price. I don™t reme mber  what it was, 
whether it was in gold or whether it was in
 mone y or whether it was in other things. 
When I say other things, some  people were, in Wi
erzbnik, like if we left a lot of things - 
valuables - not only gold and silver, but other 
valuables like blankets and furniture and all 
this. So, you know, we could te
ll the Ukrainian go to such 
and such, and we have the, 
let™s say, two watches or some thing. Take 
the two watches and bring me  a gun. I don™t 
reme mber exactly how he got the first gun because
 that™s as far as he got, the first gun. 
On the second try, they caught 
the Ukrainian, when he was st
ealing. Instead of taking one 
gun with him or whatever, they caught hi
m stealing - they found two guns in his 
possession when he - whatever. So, of course, 
they investigated and 
they interrogated him 
and he said, ﬁHe doesn™t know the name , but 
there is one of the policeme n.ﬂ So, they 
lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, a
nd the Ukrainian came in and of course he 
sold it to Adrian, so he we nt there and he
 showed, ﬁThis is the policeman that bought 
from me the gun.ﬂ Right away, Becker came 
in and he started interrogating my husband, 
and my husband said, Adrian, he says, ﬁI
 never bought from hi m a gun. I don™t know 
him. I didn™t - I never saw hi m.ﬂ But, of 
course, they didn™t believe him. He was 
interrogated and we had such a bunker, a sma
ll bunker that was ma de out of concrete. 
They put him there for a while, and then Jude
nrat went to Becker, and Becker came in 
and he said that he is lying, that Adrian 
is lying, because the Ukrainian didn™t have any 
problems finding him, and he™s going to be c
ondemned to death. So, the Judenrat decided 
that - Becker you can buy him. This is the 
guy who took out _____, so, he says, ﬁOkay, if 
you give me –ﬂ No, the Jew said, the Judenr
at said to him, ﬁ How do you know?  Maybe 
he™s lying. Why not put him some where like
 lock him up unt il we find out, until the 
investigation is through. 
If this is true what happened, 
then he should be killed, but how 
you can take an innocent ma n?  I mean the 
Ukrainian, ma ybe he had another reason why 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
59 
 
he showed that this is the 
guy that bought from him the gun.ﬂ So, they agreed. They put 
him in this bunker, and he had to dig his ow
n grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other, 
the Baumga rten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought 
the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he™s condemned to 
death. He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, 
and whatever it is, and so he read this to 
him, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because 
they kept him there and then when he got hi
s money, they wanted a kilo of gold. A kilo 
of gold, but we didn™t have gold, so everybody, if they hid some  ring or whatever, even 

teeth they we re putting in their head, and wh
at happened, they went to Becker and this 
Baumgarten to say, ﬁNow, you can 
start the investigation.ﬂ So, in order for him not to be 
able to escape, they took him out of the 
bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his 
head - like, they put him on a bench, took o
ff his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a 
sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or what
ever  with holes in it? They put it over the 
head. They took two rubber sticks or whatever
 and they had such whips - whatever you 

call it - and they told him that he would get 
now a hundred whips and he has to count. So, 
you know, one, two, three– Adrian said after 
the twentieth whip, his body was numb. He 
says he couldn™t even feel a
nything. He didn™t care. So, anywa
y, after they did that, they 
put him back into the police barrack there, 
because they figured that after his body was 
black and blue and red and bloody. But he was 
a very strong boy, and don™t forget that in 
1943 he was nineteen. So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. They put him in the 
barrack and they said, ﬁThis is 
only so that he can™t escape 
or can™t do anything.ﬂ So, they 
took him from the bunker because he couldn™t 
breathe there, and they put him in the 
barrack, and the next day they called in 
appel
. Everybody had to go to the - everybody 
had to an 
appel
 so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot 
who will take part, that if th
ings like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes 
they will kill ten people for each one that es
capes, and in addition, they are not going to - 
because some body - they didn™t say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - some body 
bought the gun for a certain purpose. They
 didn™t know about the gun that already 
existed. They were talking about the gun th
at they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?  
There must be a reason why they wanted the 
gun, and while they were doing it, the guys 
that were thinking of escaping, of the upris
ing, they decided that when they visited 
Adrian later, when he was so sick, that th
ey had to escape at th
e first opportunity. So, 
when everybody was standing at the 
appel
 and they were saying that, the policemen were 
moving because they we re always he lping to 
round up people. So, they went to Adrian™s 
room. They took him out. They had some  
shears, and they decided, because the 
Ukrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay 
was kept, was on the gate. But they decide
d to cut - there was ten of them, ten young 
people. I don™t know how ma ny policemen, but 
I think about two or 
three policemen. The 
rest were young boys that were always in c
ontact to do the uprising. So, while they were 
talking and we were watched by the Ukrain
ians and the policem
en moving around, they 
cut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adri
an was at the time , you can imagine, after 
he got those lashes the night before or th
e day be fore. They jumped over the fence and 
started running. They had to run quickly over 
the road because on the other side of the 
road there we re forests and the Germans usuall
y, like, all they wanted is to get to the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
60 
 
forest as fast as they could. But meanwhile 
Schrodt, the guy that wa
s watching, he started 
shooting. So, imme diately they took all the Uk
rainians and Schrodt was in charge. He 
had a motorcycle and he started running after 
them. But until they found they were a little 
bit further. So, anyway they ma nage d to go to
 the forest and the Uk
rainians and Schrodt 
came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), 
like they said, ﬁI 
am telling you, the young 
Wilczek (ph) ________,ﬂ which in German me ans the younger Wilczek (ph) I ki lled 
personally. So, we all thought that he™s dead, 
like his mother and his sister assume d that 
he™s completely dead. Meanwhile
, the ten of them ma naged to go to the forest, and what 
are they going to do?  I mean, 
they run away the way they were. Nothing - they had 
nothing on them. They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don™t know why Adrian didn™t 

take his gun. I never asked him that question, bu
t when they reached the forest, they were 
very happy. And we had three kinds of partisans 
in the forest. One - I™ll name  the m by the 
Polish name , and then I™ll try to translate. One was 
Armia Rudowa
 (ph), which means the 
People™s Army. This was run by the Russians.
 It was a Communist
 party under Russian 
supervision, and they were taking everybody, 
like not everybody. They were accepting 
people that when they needed them. The second group was called 
Armia Kryowa
 (ph), 
which means the home army. Those were Po
lacks, those were Polish people. They 
wouldn™t accept Jews, but they would accept Po
lish people. They didn™t kill the Jews. 
They hated them, but they didn™t kill them. But then there was an 
Innoset
 (ph) which was 
a partisan group that were like Nazi, National 
Polish Organization that they were killing 
the Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites. So, anyway, they were sitting there. 
I reme mber four na me s - three name s  - four name s. I reme mb er four name s of the 
escapees. I don™t reme mber th
e rest. So, it was Adrian. It 
was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph), 
he was the real first cousin of Daniel Levi
cz (ph) from Wa rsaw ghe
tto. And, the third one 
was Freumi k Singer (ph), he was from Opatow
 - he was related to Tobjah We isblum 
(ph), and the fourth one was Jame s Levy (ph)
, he was also a policeman, and there were 
six others, but I really don™t reme mber theirname s now. So, as they we re waiting in the 

forest, the Russian group came by. So, they told them that they are from c a mp escapees 
and so on. So the guys said, ﬁI can™t take te
n. We  can™t take ten. We  don™t have room for 
ten. We  don™t have arms for ten.ﬂ Because 
the supplies came dire
ctly from Russia by 
plane. So, they couldn™t take so ma ny. So, he
 says, ﬁ We can only take two of you.ﬂ So, he 
picked up this Freumi k (ph) from Opatow a
nd they picked Adrian. And, he says, ﬁAnd 
you stay here, ma ybe the next group will take you because we  don™t have room.ﬂ The r e 

was apparently 25 of them in this group, th
is Russian group. So, there were 27 of them. 
Then - so, I will now speak about them, and I™
ll come back later to those. I™ll say what 
happened to them later. So, anyway they star
ted to - they needed mi ner. What I me a n 
mi ners - the ones who will put mi nes under brid
ges so that the German ar ms couldn™t put 
them in trains like - what they had to do, th
ey had to put mi nes under the bridges, but the 
mi nes were not like today™s sophisticated. They
 had their mi ne. They had the string. They 
had to first go by boat, don™t forget the 
Germans were watching. They were over every 
bridge, there were German soldiers walking ba
ck and forth because that™s what they were 
afraid of, that the bridges would be mi ned. So, t hey had to swi m or go by such a boat that 

couldn™t hear anything under the bridge, put 
the mi ne there, go far enough with the string, 
wait until the train comes - goes by, and pull it.
 It was a very dangerous job, and very 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
61 
 
specialized because when the Germans were up 
there, if they heard anybody in the rive r, 
they were shooting them right 
away. So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were 
accepted, Freumi k (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had 
different encounters with the Germans looki
ng for them, but the Germans were always 
afraid to go straight to the fo
rest. They had people that were
 in the village, Polish villages 
that were telling them about the moveme nt 
of the  Germans and where they were going, 
and whether they were comi ng, what happened he
re and there. So, they had contact with 
the world. They had enough to eat there. I m
ean, not that they were given special - like 
Adrian says, they would bring them a  gl
op of pork, you know, the fat, and they would 
just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread
 or anything because it depends on what 
they had and brought in, and he says, ﬁYou woul
dn™t believe what I could eat - this pure 
fat.ﬂ And, they could really eat the pound of 
fat without anything. So, they weren™t really 
hungry. They slept in the woods, and they we
re doing the mi ne work. That was their 
work.  
 
Q: Now, when the Russian– 
 
A: I will tell you about the others. 
 
Q: But, I wanted to ask you, there was no que
stion about whether thes
e guys were Jewish, or 
they said they were not Jewish?  
 
A: No, they didn™t say. And, they knew that they
 were Jewish, and to su
ch a point they said 
that they are happy that Adrian had the na
me  Wi l czek (ph)  which means ﬁlittle wolfﬂ 
because everybody in the partisan group had a nickname  and the nickna me was an 
animal. Do you know what I mean?  Like, he wa
s called a cat, a dog, whatever. So, he had 
- his name ﬁlittle wolfﬂ was suitabl e, but
 they knew that 
they were Jewish. 
 
Q: Tell me  something, Adrian™s physical c
ondition then– Did anybody take care of him?  
 
A: And, you know what?  That™s what I™m going to 
say. At first, they let him rest because 
they told them what happened. So, those we
re the Russians, mostly Russians there. 
Anyway, one day, he got so sick, he got deliri
ous, so they said they had to move for 
whatever reason, and they told hi m t hat they 
can™t take him because he couldn™t walk. So, 
he asked them to kill him. He said, ﬁMaybe 
if you kill me because I...ﬂ But they coul dn™t 
kill hi m. So, they gave hi m, like, they gave him a gun. They covered hi m up. They gave 

him all the food they had, and they left him there. They kissed him and they said, ﬁWe 
are very sorry,ﬂ because they left hi m ther
e to die because he wa
s so sick. So some 
people were going by the woods and they found 
him and they took him - some Polacks, 
most of them were collaborating with the partisans. They were the people that were 
saying where the Germans are. So, they took h
im home  and they, and it took him ten days 
and he was better. So, he decided to go back 
to his group. When he went to his - before 
he went out, he contacted one of
 those people that they werein contact with, and he said, 
ﬁI™m sorry to tell you that some body denounced the group, the Russian group. The 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
62 
 
Germans came in while they were asleep in 
there, and–and one of the - where they kept 
horses or cows or whatever 
- one of those buildings, they
 put it afire and everybody got 
killed. So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he c
ouldn™t believe it. So, he went–he went back 
to the woods, after he felt be
tter, and he decided he™ll wait 
for another grou
p. I™ll tell you 
more about the others that were 
left, the eight that were left, bu
t I have to finish this story 
first. So– 
 
Q: Maybe we should stop so you can continue. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: I don™t want you to get caught in the mi ddle.

Q: Hania, before we go back to Adrian in th
e woods, let™s talk just 
a little bit about him 
getting a gun and where you think he ma y left 
it, if you have any idea, and did he have 
any experience with guns?  
 
A: He - he was a Jewish boy. He never had - 
he wasn™t violent. He never saw a gun in his 
life. I don™t think if he was given a gun 
whether he knew what to do with it unless 
someone will tell him or show him. I don™t 
know whether the gun was - the gun that he 
bought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - wh
ether the gun was at al
l operational, and 
whether - I couldn™t tell you, ma
ybe it was, ma ybe it was one of the best, but even if he 
had it, he wouldn™t know how to use it un
less someone would show it to him. So– 
 
Q: So, tell me , of these boys w
ho were planning the break-out– 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And, you were involved, too. 
 
A: I was involved. 
 
Q: Right, were there othe
r wome n involved as well?  
 
A: I was involved. Some  wome n were involve
d because we™re talki
ng about uprising. So, 
the wome n were also involved. Like, we didn™t 
think it would be so fast. We thought that 
it would take us time first of all to arms a
nd to be prepared and 
to-to- to-to prepare a 
strata-strategy. It wasn™t - th
is was just the beginning. We  
had no idea what™s - what™s 
going to be after, and we  had to be very, ve
ry careful and secretive because I think like 
that, if the Germans would have found out, 
it would™ve been death to all of us. 
 
Q: So, how ma ny of you would there ha
ve been, fifteen, twenty people?  
 
A: That™s the most - all the policemen were 
involved in it, because they - they were the 
strongest and they were the ones that were
 supposed to know how to do that, and a few 
other people. 
 
Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this?  
 
A: One would tell - we didn™t meet. They woul
d - one of the policemen woul d come  to me 
and tell me  what they decided. One would tell
 the other one who™d te
ll - we didn™t meet. 
There wasn™t no meeting. I mean, 
how could you ma ke a me e ting?  
 
Q: No, I thought that mi ght be the case, but
 one doesn™t know how those things happen. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
64 
 
 
A: We knew that the policemen were the - the in
itiators of that. So, I knew it, and ma ybe - I 
don™t know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it. Maybe she di d. 
I couldn™t tell you, and there was a few people, so 
I would say if they would tell me  to tell 
so and so, but not in certain - we 
didn™t have meetings. We  couldn™t. 
 
Q: So was there one person who was the 
leader who then ma de the decision? 
 
A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best 
at it because - because he knew how to talk to 
people - how to talk to those Ukrainians to 
get what he wanted. He was the type of a 
person that - that he knew how to - to get things. 
 
Q: And who ha d experience with arms  in this?  
 
A: Nobody, nobody, even the policeme n, they didn™t
 carry anything in their hands. I me an, 
I™m talking the Jewish policemen. I mean, they
 were only assigned a certain job and they 
were - there was a good job, you know, by co
mp arison, you know, and they didn™t have 
to go to the factory and - and wo
rk at the iron stove where it wa
s so hot that they couldn™t 
breathe. So, they - they were glad that they 
had this job, but they were - they were all 
thinking of uprising and getting 
rid of because we were too 
long - too long we listened to 
that - we went like sheep to do that. 
 
Q: So, when you all were thinking about this
 separately - because clearly you™re not 
supposed to have conversations b
ecause it™s too dangerous, right?  
 
A: No, it™s too dangerous, and 
I™ll tell you, I couldn™t take 
a part in the running away, 
anyway, because they told us that if some one
 runs away, first the family and then ten 
other people and there were 
cases where they killed ten people for one. If one escaped, 
they would round up ten people and kill them - shot them. 
 
Q: So, you were not going to take any chance. 
 
A: I wouldn™t because I had my father and my
 two sisters. You couldn™t take Renia with 
you, but, you know, if I took part in it and kne
w what was going on, and in case - listen, 
we didn™t - we didn™t expect that everybody 
- everybody would carry a gun. First we had 
to get the guns. I mean, the idea started - 
came to us, and we tried, but we weren™t 
successful because we just started. 
 
Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as– 
 
A: As ma ny as possible. That™s why ten of them
 - ten of them were from this group. The ten 
people were from this group that 
ran away that night - that day. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
65 
 
Q: And the idea was for that group, whatever
 the fifteen or whoever ma ny of t hat group 
could run away. 
 
A: Run away, and then - and then come  a
nd do something with, you know, like to ma ybe to 
get other guns some whe r e else. Go to see the partisans and come  back and - and - and 
free all of us, but it was a 
stupid idea, but nobody - like you - 
you didn™t believe, but you 
had to believe that some thing would be done th
at we are not going to 
be killed like, you 
know, like just go voluntarily to just be killed
 because the way we saw it, we didn™t know 
about - about what happened in Treblinka. We
 didn™t know that there was an Auschwitz, 
but it was enough that any German ca n - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how 

did we know?  Maybe one day all of them woul
d just, keep shooting until they shoot us 
all. So, those ten that ran 
away, they were from t his group, and they had the best 
opportunity because the guards weren™t th
ere - only one guard. The Germans and 
everybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson.  
 
Q: So, now Adr i an having gotten better, and his– 
 
A: He came - he came to - he come - he™s in 
the woods, but of course, already half his time - 
like he was there for a long time with them, b
ecause I didn™t tell you, that all he di d was 
the mi nes and stuff like that. I didn™t tell you 
everything that happened because it wasn™t 
important, but now - now it™s alre
ady close to - already ™44.  
 
Q: So, he™s with them al mo st a year or six months?  
 
A: Yes, he™s been with them for a long time, but
 that™s when he got sick and they left him. 
Like, he was working every day 
that he had another assignme nt. Most of them, he was a 
specialist in mi ning. He was - I mean, working 
so long every day at it, he was a specialist 
in it. Because they had to observe the - the 
bridge going up. Like, when he had this string, 
he had to go far enough so that nothing w
ould happen to him. He had to - he - he 
activated the mi ne, the bridge went up in flam
es or whatever it was,
 whatever, and he had 
to run away back to the forest. So, each - each of such escapade was very, very 

dangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that.  
 
Q: So, they taught him how to do all this?  
 
A: They taught him, and of course, he used 
his gun very efficiently 
later. I mean, after - 
because they carried guns all the time. 
 
Q: So, now he™s waiting for another group. 
 
A: He™s been waiting for another group, then 
the worst group come s in, 
and that was already 
™44. Don™t forget that the war in Poland - in Po
land, in the woods there or in this district 
already finished around January of 1945. So, that
 was shortly before - before the end of 
the war. Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
66 
 
was in Poland, the Russians were very close. 
So, January was already the end of the war. 
So, anyway, when he came  back to
 the woods, the worst of the groups, 
Anazed
 (ph), got 
him. So, the - the name of - 
the name  of the captain or wh
atever, whatever he was, I 
know one of the leaders of th
is group was - his name  was 
Orlig (ph), which me ans - how 
do you call it now?  The bird that has such a 
big beak, such a very
 aristocratic bird. 
 
Q: Tern?  
 
A: No, aristocratic. I forgot now. Anyway, it was 
a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the 
truth because  there was no use to tell him that 
- that he™s Polish or whatever. So, the guy 
looked at him and he figured like this - it™s al
mo st the end of the war, what they did now, 
the Germans would go away because they were
 so metimes even they were more against 
Russians than the Germans. They were against Ge rmans, too, but if they have to choose, 
they would kill the Russians. So, he fi gured lik
e in his mi nd was that if he keeps a Jew, 
he™ll have a token no ma tter what happens. 
He had a son who befriended Adrian very 
much - was a friend. So, he told him,  ﬁPlease 
don™t tell the guys inthe group that you are 
Jewish.ﬂ And, he went and he taught him to pr
ay the Catholic prayer, and he ma de - he 
was the one that started the prayer and then - 
but, Adrian was quite 
honest. So, he told his 
son, but the son never told on him. Adrian di
dn™t realize that he wa
nted to - that he 
wanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wa
nted to save his life by holding a Jew, but 
he didn™t tell anybody else, but he figured 
when the Russians come , you prove to them 
that he™s a saint because he has a Jew there.
 So, anyway, soon after the wa r finished - and 
he was working with them in the woods th
ere - and soon the war finished, the Russians 
started appearing. And right away, this guy wanted
 to say that - that he saved a Jew, but 
Adrian didn™t pay attention to
 it, but the Russian - the wors
t part was that the Russian, 
when he saw hi m, he said, ﬁTell me  your st
ory.ﬂ So, Adrian tells him the story, and he 
says he was in the People™s Army. They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there 
were two of them - he didn™t say Je wish becau
se  he says that they escaped the camp, and 
they were accepted there, and he says, ﬁThi
s is the last group.ﬂ 
He didn™t say anything 
about being Jewish or anyt
hing because he didn™t know who the Russian is. So, the 
Russian says to him in Russian, he says, ﬁY
ou know, this is a very interesting story. 
There was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks,ﬂ and he says, ﬁThat™s 
interesting that one Polack got out and 
all the Russians, you 
know, all the Russians 
perished.ﬂ  So, Adrian said, he says to his 
guy, ﬁKill him, like, shoot him - shoot him.ﬂ So, 
he says, ﬁWhat do you want?  I™m Jewish.ﬂ S
o, the guy says in Jewish to him, ﬁ Why 
didn™t you tell me  that befor
e?ﬂ So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the 
Anazed 
that killed so ma ny Jews on his ways, trie
d to - si nce Adrian was already there, 
like the Russian and hi m were already such frie
nds, and so, he tried to say that he was 
also good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn™t. So, Adrian says, ﬁI am the 

first Jew that he saved.ﬂ Because he told hi
m, when he accepted him, ﬁYou are the first 
Jew that I me t in my life that I™ll save you 
- that I™m going to save your life.ﬂ So, he 
repeated it. I mean, he just 
said it. I don™t know what happe
ned to them. I don™t think that 
anything happened to them. Adrian was right aw
ay ma de, like, he was a lieutenant right 
away. They put all the stars on him, and then
 when he came home , he worked for the - 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
67 
 
like, he was - he worked in the army as a li
eutenant. Now, I™ll go back to Salik Anulevicz 
(ph) and the others. When this - when they 
took the two of them - the two of them - the 
two guys Freumi k (ph) and Adrian, they were 
very much concerned what happened to the 
other guys, but they never found out. Only af
ter the war, they found out what happened. 
Salik started his stor y. When they took them 
and went away, there was eight of them left. 
So, 
Armia Kryowa
, which was the home  ar my, which wa
sn™t killing the Jews, but they 
were - they were doing everythi
ng possible to make their life 
mi serable, went by and they 
see eight people, and the people 
- they all told them what happened. They told them, ﬁWe 
run away from this Jewish camp in–ﬂ And not
 all of them spoke because the - Hassidic 
Jews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had 
a very big accent. You could right away notice 
that they were not - I mean, you couldn™t 
tell them you are Polish. They all knew that 
they were Jewish. So, they said, they, so, ther
e was eight of them - they - they were anti-
Se mitic, but they said, ﬁWe are not going to
 kill you, but what we are going to do–ﬂ 
They told them to undress. They left them eight people naked, the way they are. They 
took their clothes away. He says, ﬁNow, wait fo
r the Russians to come , for  the other army 
- for the People™s Army. They™ll take you.ﬂ Bu
t, and they laughed and laughed that they 
left them alive but comp letely naked and took 
away their clothes. So, they were there and 
they started thinking, ﬁWhat are we going to
 do now? ﬂ  I mean, they can™t move. They 
have nothing. They have no clothes. So, they
 sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only 
one that spoke without an accent. So, they
 said, ﬁYou know what?ﬂ There™s a forest - 
there was a farmhouse and the guy was looking af
ter the forests, you know. So, he says, 
ﬁThere is this house. If you can go there and 
bring us clothes or f
ood or some thing.ﬂ So, 
he says, ﬁWhy me ?  Why not you? ﬂ  He says,ﬁYou can speak Polish.ﬂ So - so, he went. 
He decided - I mean, he had no alternative.
 He we nt there, and on the way, a woma n 
came out of the house, and he told her th
e story. It was a young woma n. It was the 
daughter of the - this forestma n. So, s he took 
him home. She gave him something to wear 
and food and the father came in and the father 
says, ﬁI can™t take ei
ght people. I cannot.ﬂ 
ﬁOkay, we can take food and clothe s and whatever  we can.ﬂ But he says, ﬁThey will kill 
me , the Germans, if the y know that I hide 
so ma ny Jews.ﬂ Anyway, apparently the girl 
fell in love with this Salik Anulevicz (ph) a
nd she decided to save him, and she took him 
in and she wa s hiding him there, and he surviv
ed the war in her place. Now, I™ll go back 
to the seven and I™ll tell you what happened 
to Sa lik Anulevicz (ph). So, he and the 
daughter - this daughter and her name  was Hela 
(ph), because he always talked about her, 
Salik Analewicz, after the war. So, the girl™s 
name  was Hela (ph). He and Hela (ph) were 
going - went to give them food and give th
em clothes, but they under no circumstances 
can they keep them there because there was 
eight of them. So, they were helping them 
with - nobody knows what happened to them. 
Nobody - they didn™t survive the war. How 
did they perish in the woods because when one
 day they were there, they weren™t there. 
Like, you know, they were taking daily food to 
them and water, but they weren™t there. 
Nobody knows whether they perished and they must have perished because nobody came  
back. Now, I™ll go back to this Salik Anulevi
cz (ph). He lived there with this woma n and 
she promised - he promised that  he would marry her. He promised he will marry her after 
the war, but after the war he changed his mi nd, 
but he - he wanted to pay them back for 
what they did for him. So, he was a very rich
 guy - I forgot which city he lived, but he 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
68 
 
was not far from the Czechoslovakian border th
ere. They had some  real estate and stuff 
like that. He went to the lawyer and assigned 
all the real estate to her, and he says 
whenever, as long as he lives, if he can he
lp her in any way, he will help he r. I don™t 
know whether he could do it, whether she cash
ed in on his promises, whether she could 
get - although he went to a lawyer and signe
d over all this properties to her, we don™t 
know because he never - no, he saw her once. 
Her father was - her father was accused of 
being, not a Nazi, but that he 
collaborated with the Germans,
 and they took him out, put 
him to jail, and she new where Salik was in Po
land at the time yet. So, she says, ﬁI want 
you to be a witness to telling hi m that we - 
that we saved you.ﬂ So, he went there and 
they let the fa ther go. Whether he was a 
German collaborator 
or not, I don™t know. 
Anyway, Sa lik Anulevicz (ph) 
went to We st Europe, and th
en he went to Br azil. He 
ma rried a Swiss girl, and he was comi ng to To
ronto every year because he had - he died 
five years ago. He died before my husband 
because the two of them were friends like, 
you know, and not only that, he had a brother 
Hirsa (ph). He was comi ng and he always 
went, like he stayed with us with his wife
 and whenever we talked to them, he was 
talking about this Hela. He wanted to go to Poland to see Hela, and the wife  was willing 

to go with him, but she says, ﬁYou only know her first name , that Hela. She must have - 
since then she must have been ma rried. She 
mus t  have moved out of this far mhouse. How 
are we going to find her? ﬂ He wanted to see 
Hela who saved his life. All his life, he was 
talking about her. He died, as
 I said, about five years ago. 
We  never heard of the eight - 
no, the seven other guys, and Freun (ph) was ki
lled together with th
e - with like, by the 
Germans together with the whole 
group. So, this is Adrian™s story. 
 
Q: Did he fall in love with Hela?  
 
A: Yes, but he was - you know, she was a very si
mple girl. She was a very simple girl. At 
the time , he felt that he wanted a Jewish 
wife. You know, s o me  people are - he was one 
Jewish, he was religious. He was a nice guy. He
 wanted a Jewish wife. So, he decided 
that ma ybe if he gives her the real estate 
that they had - houses 
and apartment houses or 
something - I don™t whether she ever got it 
because the Polish governme nt took over all 
the properties, Jewish propert
ies, so nobody gets anything an
yway. So, maybe she didn™t 
get it. He wanted to - and his ways, he was oka
y, but in his wa ys, he was also simple like 
he didn™t know how to go about it. He 
didn™t know to go to Poland and to go the 
far mhouse and start looking for Hela. 
 
Q: There™s some thing so humorous about th
e meeting. He™s comi ng out of the woods nude. 
 
A: And you know, ma y I say some thing on the tape? He
 said it in Jewish he said to him - I 
will say it in Polish because my Jewi sh is not
 too good - he says, ﬁYou are lucky that you 

were naked because when she saw you, she fe
ll in love with you.ﬂ But those were the 
circumstances, and this 
is a real true story.  
 
Q: Unbelievable. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
69 
 
A: Yeah,unbelievable. 
 
Q: So, she got to see everything long before most people. 
 
A: That™s what he said. He said it in 
Jewi sh, ﬁYou were lucky that they undressed you 
because ot he rwise nobody would™ve accepted you.ﬂ But he was a very good looking ma n, 
and he was - he lived in
 Sao Paolo in Brazil. 
 
Q: But, you think he didn™t know her last name ?  
 
A: He said he didn™t.  
 
Q: Henever– 
 
A: Because, in a way, he was quite simple. Becau
se I mean he asks his wife she should go 
and look for Hela, and she says, ﬁYou know wh
a t?  I will go with you, but that he tells me  
where it was, he doesn™t reme mber where 
the farmhouse was.ﬂ You know, like, he was 
there, but he was hidden. So, how did 
he know?  You know?  He don™t know, and he 
wasn™t smart enough to reme mber, because so
me  people are fast, but Hela, how can you 
fi nd Hela in Poland? 
 
Q: So, let™s go back.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You are now in the camp, after these boys l
eave, what is the eff
ect?  What did the Nazis 
do?  Or the Germans do?  
 
A: See that was shortly before - that was in 1943, but it must have been towards the end of 
1943, close to ™44. We ll, they didn™t do anyt
hing. They didn™t kill anybody when they ran 
away. They didn™t because - maybe because Schrodt said that he killed them. He killed a 
person - he young Wilczek (ph), as 
he said. Maybe he thought that he killed them all. I 
don™t know. I don™t reme mber suffering a
ny consequences because of that. 
 
Q: That seems surprising. 
 
A: Very surprising, yeah, but nothing happened. 
 
Q: And the people who didn™t leave, who were
 part of the group who were thinking about 
resisting. 
 
A: Yeah, there was another - then later, it wa
s another try of running 
after them. They were 
already, how should I say, energized by their 
running away. And one night people went - 
they started running - people st
arted running to the barbed 
wi res, cutting the barbed 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
70 
 
wires. And when I say a lot, I don™t know
 how ma ny, but I would say maybe a hundred 
people got killed by the Germans, be cause th
ey started shooting, th
e Ukrainians and the 
Germans, everybody, because they were much 
more ready to combat all those people 
after the escape than before, because before
 it never happened, and - and those - I™m sure 
that Chris and Renia mus t  have told you th
e story, how those people were moaning. They 
were lying there. They didn™t kill them, a
nd they - they were crying and shouting and 
screaming, all those people, because they trie
d to escape. We didn™t 
try to escape because 
some how I didn™t see - I mean, where would 
we go?  There wa s nowhere for us to go. If 
we could run away and be accepted by some one and live with some one or have some  
kind of a connection, but we didn™t. And we were
 afraid that if one 
of us would run away, 
the whole family would suffer, would be kill
ed, and we didn™t - we couldn™t leave the 
father there, and we couldn™t leave Re nia. 
I mean, where can you take Renia?  I™m telling 
you, she was a sickly - always sick, always, ev
ery Tuesday and Thursday
 like this - it™s a 
Jewish expression - she had either a cold or
 she was sneezing. She was always sick. So, 
we didn™t but people did. That was after what
 happened to the ten, like after they run 
away, there was immedi ately th
e rest of them wa nted to run away, too. Because they 
figured if they could do it, but they run 
away under special circumstances, and those 
people started at night. So, they were justshot like - there were so ma ny dead people. 
 
Q: Actually, neither Chris no
r Renia told me  about this. 
 
A: Is that true? 
 
Q: Did they just spontaneously - this was 
a plan that hundreds of
 people were just–?  
 
A: Yeah, when I say hundreds, but about 
a hundred people, I would say, about that. 
 
Q: And they had no guns?  
 
A: No, nothing. They were just running to the 
barbed wires and tried 
to escape the way the 
others because, you know, they saw what happene
d that the wires were cut and they run 
away, so they just blindly - they had nowhere
 to go. And all the guards we re on alert, the 
Germans would come. I mean, Becker with 
his troops would come  right away. I don™t 
know. That wasn™t heroic; that was stupid. 
 
Q: I think we ought to stop the tape here to change. 
 
A: So, we are almost close to the end of Starachowice. 
 
End of Tape #8 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
71 
 
 
Tape #9
 
 
Q: When we ended the last tape, we were 
talking about this s
econd break-out that you 
thought was really ma dness. So, all these peopl
e™s bodies were just le
ft there, and they 
were left to die, moaning all night long. Wa s 
there, this time, a repercussion inside the 
camp? This was still in Majowka. Y
ou were not in the third camp yet. 
 
A: No, we weren™t in the third camp. 
 
Q: Did the Germans do anything to you who were left?  
 
A: No, nothing. Because they - there were so 
many bodies there that they had enough bodies 
already, and it was close to - was close to
 us going to Auschwitz already, close. 
 
Q: Did you know people who tried to escape?  
 
A: Yeah, I know, because, I know a lot of
 people - young girls that ran, yeah. 
 
Q: And, did you know beforehand that 
they were going to try this?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you try to convinc
e people not to do it?  
 
A: No, because I didn™t believe anybody would 
do it. We all thought about running away all 
the time . That was - that was our aim, to 
run away from this horrible camp, but you know 
when the time  ca me  to run away, we were 
too - too - too scared 
to because we were 
afraid. We  c ouldn™t take our father out. We
 couldn™t take Renia out. And we are afraid 
that they would be killed.
 So, we didn™t even try. 
 
Q: You talked about roll call when they were going to do selections at time s. Did you have 
roll call every day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn™t in this camp?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So, how did– 
 
A: We didn™t have roll call. They would call 
all the people - they had an announcement, and 
they - and they, you know, the policemen then 
the Ukrainians said to come  out and the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
72 
 
Jewish policemen would round us up - round us 
up and tell us that 
there™s going to be a 
lecture, or whatever you call it,
 that we have to go and lis
ten to it. That was the time 
when Adrian and his nine friends ran away. 
 
Q: So, how would you know - how would th
ey count how ma ny people there were?  
 
A: They were counting, but the policemen w
ould, you know, don™t forget when they started 
counting, they knew how much we have to 
have, and the Germans were very gullible. 
Like, I told them, let™s say th
at to talk, as an example, 
was 1,479, as an example. So, I 
would tell the policeman that
 we have 1,479 people. So, they would come  and report how 
ma ny peopl e - people were taken from each barrack when he was rounding them up. 
They were writing down - he™s there. So, they 
- they made a count th
at should agree with 
1,479, and I reme mber Altov (ph) saying ﬁ
Shtumpt
!ﬂ Because he didn™t know that we 
fabricated those numbers because all the numbe
rs he started counting together, not sayi ng 
the amount that I just told you was a fictitious amount. 
 
Q: So, you would ma ke up a number?  
 
A: I knew the number because they would come  - a policeman would come  to me  and say, 
ﬁHow much do we need?ﬂ Like
 this, I™d say, ﬁ1,479.ﬂ I™m just inventing the number. 
Okay, so everyone knew. So, the first one, let™
s say came fi rst and then the last one said, 

ﬁHow much do I need? ﬂ
 You know, I mean, to give the num
ber, and then they counted it 
together, and then Altov (ph) would come  a
nd start counting, ﬁBarrack 3 has so ma ny. 
Shtumpt
 (ph)!ﬂ but meanwhile there were who 
knows how many mi ssing?  But, we had to 
do it. I mean, we had to do it, and if they fi
nd out, I mean they didn™t find us out, but if 
they did. So, we would have had to suffer the consequences, but I me an, that was the only 

thing that we  could do. and Irinst (ph), that ™s Adrian™s sister™s husband, got killed 
because they found one person in the barrack. 
 
Q: That™s what I was going to ask. Th
is could be very dangerous if you– 
 
A: Very dangerous - they killed him on t he 
spot, because we counted and the count was 
right, but there was somebody was - wasn™t supp
osed - didn™t come  out. So, they killed 
him on the spot. 
 
Q: Would that affect food di
stribution because, if saying th
ere were X number, but there 
were more–? 
 
A: I don™t think so because when they delivered to
 the kitche n - I wasn™t in charge of it, so I 
really don™t know. I remember that Sal Kabiren™s 
(ph) wife was in charge of it. So, she - 
she - but, the Judenrat most likely was orderi
ng or whatever. I know 
- I really don™t know 
how it worked, whether they ordered it, whether 
they sent at random so much of this and 
so much of this. I couldn™t tell you. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
73 
 
Q: During the break, you described nigh
tmares that you had after the war. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you have nightmares or dreams th
at weren™t nightma res during the war?  
 
A: No, always - during the war?  
 
Q: Yes, during your experience in the camps here. 
 
A: Yes, after the war or before?  
 
Q: No,during. 
 
A: During the war. I don™t know. I must have
 had nightma res, but I don™t recall of any 
incidents of any importance. 
 
Q: Did you sleep well, do you think?  
 
A: Nobody slept well, really, because you were
 always thinking what happens, I mean, 
things like that happened and we never 
knew what™s going to happen the next day 
because there was always some thing happening 
in camp. I only told you a few stories that 
affected me  personally, but such stories were
 - were happening all the time that affe ct 
other people. Everyday some thing happened. 
 
Q: So, do you recall when you went to be d in the ba rrack that you would close your eyes and 
begin to see the things th
at happened during the day?  
 
A: Always,always. 
 
Q: So, it would be difficult to fall asleep. 
 
A: One day, I refused to come  to work because, you know, Vaschek (ph) wa s insulting 
everyone. I™m not saying that he was insul
ting me. Calling names - all the dirtiest  of 
name s he would call, and I wasn™t used to it. 
He wasn™t bad to me . 
Like, I cannot say that 
he did any harm to me , but I just didn™t wa
nt to suffer all those insults. So, one day I 
decided not to come . So, he sent a Jewish po
liceman with a pail of water to throw on me! 
[Laughs] So, I had to come  to work, and that
 was his way of, but he still called me  all 
kinds of dirty name s. You know, he called me
 whatever he wanted to - not only me , 
everybody, all the girls, the other me n, the 
policemen, everybody. That was his way, but 
later on not only that I wa s glad
 that I worked for him not A
ltov (ph) or any of the other 
guys, because I would be dead by now. 
 
Q: So, that day some body t hrew water at you, did you come  to work wet?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
74 
 
 
A: Right away, wet. I was scare
d. I said to myself, ﬁ The next 
thing would be that he would 
kill me .ﬂ But, he was very - he knew that 
I was a very good worker, very consciencious. 
He can find everything and always, and I kept 
hi s records to such 
a point that he knew 
right away, like, he was happy 
with my work. So, I knew that
 he™s not going to kill me  
and take some body else.  
 
Q: Do you have any idea whether a
ny of these record
s still exist? 
 
A: I have no idea because  when they threw us
 out, we went to another camp. Who knows? 
 
Q: So, Christopher Browning, when he in
terviewed you, did he say that he had found 
anything?  
 
A: No, I really - I don™t 
know whether he would find. 
 
Q: Did you, by the way, have to ma ke copies
?  Did you have carbons or only one copy?  
 
A: No, only one copy. I was doing the lists every 
day. I mean, he didn™t need to have those 
lists, but every day - and then he put - he put
, let™s say - I don™t know how long it kept the 
records - but he kept, you know, he had - he had them under lock and key so, I don™t 
know whether he kept  them for a mo nth, fo
r two months. I don™t know. Because he didn™t 
need like from last month™s work, he didn™t n
eed the lists. I mean, 
really, he didn™t - why 
should - what would he use it fo
r except for records. But, I really don™t know what he did 
with it. 
 
Q: So, one doesn™t know whether they we re sent to Be rlin– 
 
A: I have no idea, no idea. We had no numb
ers. We  had real name s in this camp. 
 
Q: So, there were no - you weren™t 
wearing insignias or anything?  
 
A: No, nothing yet. 
 
Q: You didn™t have uniforms. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You wore your own clothes. 
 
A: No, the clothes that they were supplying. 
We didn™t - don™t - we didn™t have not a 
beautiful clothes. A shirt and some  - a T-shirt 
or - the beds that we got was better than in 
Auschwitz where we got the uniforms  and I 
couldn™t find a uniform tha t  would fit me . I 
had to change  with other girls that the uniform
 was still here, because 
then they just  threw 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
75 
 
it at you. Here, at least, like when the thi
ngs came , I had the first choice. I could™ve 
picked a better one. I, you know, than... 
 
Q: Did you have underwear and a bra?  
 
A: I must have, but where did I take it?  
 
Q: I don™t know, that™s what I™m wondering. 
 
A: Because we didn™t ha ve an underwear - underw
ear or bra in Auschwitz, but we must have 
had underwear and bra in camp, but we didn™t 
buy it. [Laughs.] I don™t reme mber, but I 
must have. We must have had it. 
 
Q: Why do you think you must have had it?  
 
A: I think so. I mi ght not as well had it 
- have had it. Really, I don™t reme mbe r . 
 
Q: Do you remember having boots for the winter
 or what sort of 
shoes did you have?  
 
A: We wore our own shoes that we
 came in with. I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: Do you remember what you were wearing in 
the brick factory, right
 before you went in?  
 
A: No, I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: You didn™t have the knapsack. 
 
A: I didn™t take the knapsack. We  didn™t bring 
it and apparently, I don™t know, I asked Renia 
and she doesn™t reme mbe r , but some  people to
ld me that they saw my mo ther carrying 
three knapsacks, and they think that this wa
s the reason why they put her - her to the bad 
side. Although, because my mother
 had a card, as working in the 
Arbeitsamt
, everybody 
had a card, a working card. We  really worked. 
My mother didn™t work, or ma ybe she did, 
who knows? But, she mu st have had a card, beca
use, like, we were giving out the cards. 
But I asked Renia. She says, ﬁOh, no.ﬂ Sh
e says, ﬁMother didn™t carry the three 
knapsacks.ﬂ But some body, I forgot who, some  fri
end told me that they saw my mother 
carrying all the knapsacks. That™s wh
y they pushed her to the bad side. 
 
Q: Why did - it was surprising to me  th
at you said Pohl would come  into the 
Arbeitsamt
 and 
tell you that the– 
 
A: Not tell me , tell the Nemcheck (ph) . 
 
Q: Oh, so you heard that?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
76 
 
A: I heard it. He didn™t tell me personally. I 
mean, I didn™t know him that well. I saw him a 
few times in the 
Arbeitsamt
, but he told that on such and su
ch a date - it™s going to be - 
they are going to close the 
Arbeitsamt
 and on such and such a date, we™ll all go to camp. 
We - we were expecting going to camp becau
se things like that were happening all 
around us.  
 
Q: So, did all the Jews realize,
 and so everybody was preparing?  
 
A: Everybody wanted to have a work card, and everybody was preparing to go to camp, 
whether they know - knew where the camp was,
 because as far as I™m concerned, I ha d 
no idea where the camp was, whether it was Ma jo
wka, Strzelnica, or Tartak (ph). I had 
no idea where those camps were until I came 
there. I didn™t have any idea what they 
looked like. I have never worked in the f
actory, the munition factory. I didn™t know what 
conditions there were there. So– But we 
had so ma ny things happening all around us, 
that - that  we knew that they
 would liquidate the ghetto, bu
t we didn™t realize how they 
would liquidate. We  didn™t think that they w
ould be so beastialic like that, you know, that 
they would be pushing, and - I wa
sn™t there, so I 
didn™t see it, but from what people tell 
me , it was horrible in this ma rketplace. So, we 
thought that they would all take us to work 
now, and we™ll go to camps. We  didn™t even 
imagine what the camps looked like inside. 
We had no idea. We  wer e  never in a camp before . 
 
Q: But you saw the people walking to the ma rketplace, am I right?  
 
A: No. I saw the people going already to the tr
ains. Because the factory where we were was 
across the road, a little to the left  of - not
 much, I would say like how to describe it, 
probably five hundred yards to the side. Like, 
let™s say on this - let™
s say where I - where 
I™m sitting is the factory. So, it wasn™t right 
across the road. It was about five, six hundred 
yards to the side, on your side. So, we  saw 
people walking from the ma rketplace, and the 
ma rketplace was also to the left of where we
 were. So, we didn™t see the ma rketplace. We  

saw only people already boarding the train. 
 
Q: Where you standing with Chris?  
 
A: Yes, with Chris. 
 
Q: And did you talk to each other about this?  
 
A: We talked - yeah, because  we said, we didn™t 
expect it to be that day. We didn™t ha ve the 
knapsacks. We didn™t have anyt
hing. We  went just the way 
we went to work. We  had 
nothing with us. 
 
Q: Did a lot of people see what wa
s going on or just the two of you?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
77 
 
A: Everybody that worked there saw it because we
 - we only had to go a little bit upstairs. 
We didn™t have that muc h supervision there b
ecause the ones that supervised us weren™t - 
it wasn™t a factory where like - it wasn™t wher
e there were people, inmates working there. 
There were regular people working there. So, 
some of them were Jewish and some  of 
them were not Jewish. So, it wasn™t such a s
upervision that the Ukra
inians or policeme n 
was watching us, what we are doing every mi
nute. We  worked and we went to see, and 
one of us would go and tell everybody else, 
and a few mi nutes later, some body, and then 
the two of would go and whatever and watch, 
and then we worked again. So, it wasn™t 
that forced labor. And if it was, we didn™t ha
ve such - that was a night shift. During the 
night, ma ybe they didn™t have so mu ch s
upervision, or ma ybe they felt sorry for us, 
whatever, but I don™t reme mber - the work was very me ssy, and dirty, and hard because, 

you know, the bricks were heavy, and we had to 
carry them when they were finished, to 
carry them elsewhere to dry them and then
 put - put them in place and so on. So, the 
work was heavy, but it wasn™t forced labor, lik
e I said. Like, we didn™
t have any soldiers, 
Germans, Ukrainians, or we didn™t. So, we 
could move around. I mean, not that we - we 
had to work. 
 
Q: So, now back in the camp, Majowka. You wa
nted to tell us the st
ory of a Frenchma n? 
 
A: Yeah, the Frenchma n was - that was in the last camp.  
 
Q: So,describe– 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: –before you do that, describe the move to the last. What™s going on?  
 
A: They built a new camp for us and that was for the purpose just to keep us there until the 
train come s to takes us to Auschwitz. We  
didn™t know; we were moved there. I don™t 
reme mber whether people were going to work 
from there, because it was a short time, 
ma ybe two weeks, ma ybe three we
eks. I really don™t remember the times so exactly. But, 

once we mo ved into this camp, there were no Ukrainian guards. There were no - the 
Germans di dn™t come , but - like we cal
led them the canaries. They were– 
 
Q: Why?  
 
A: The canaries. I™ll tell you why. That was a 
German army. It was an army  - I knew the 
name , now I forgot - it was 
Polizei
, just let me  think. Those were the ones that were 
guarding the soldiers that th
ey shouldn™t run away. Not, 
Sicherheit Polizei
. I knew the 
name . I forgot. Anyway, it will come  back. Th
ey were wearing light 
- they were wearing 
light green uniforms  and yellow insignia al
l over. The insignia was yellow. We called 
them canaries because, like, we didn™t know
 who they were. They were all around the 
camp. There was - Altov (ph) didn™t come , any 
more of our - those people that looked - 
that were in 
Lager
 before. They were staying outside the new camp. Ever y, I would say, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
78 
 
it would be six feet or so. Let™s say ever
y six weeks a canary would stay. You know, one 
of those soliders, but what™s
 their name ?  I just - I was thinking and I knew it for one 
mi nute only - 
Feld Polizei
. Those were the - they were
 guarding the soldiers they 
shouldn™t run away, but, you know, dur
ing the battle. I just said 
it and I forget it. I just 
told you and I forgot again, yeah, 
Feld Polizei
. And we knew that some thing horrible is 
going to happen because we didn™t see any 
of the guys that were norma lly comi ng to 
camp, whether they were - no Ukrainians, no Germans, only this 
Feld Polizei
 all around 
the camp. They were the ones who put us later on wagons. Anyway, when we were there, 
we still kept the office, but I don™t reme
mber any German being with me  because 
Vaschek (ph) didn™t work there for a while. Th
ey sent him to Ostrowiec, or ma ybe they 
sent - like they just let 
him go. I don™t know. He wasn™t needed. So, there was nobody 
there but the typewriter was still there and I wa
s still there, Jewish policemen were there. 
I don™t reme mber any Germans except of those canaries outside. 
 
Q: This is in Tarbut (ph), or you are goi
ng back and forth, or this is the end?  
 
A: This is the end. This is the camp that 
was the end camp. Anyway, one of the soldiers 
came up and he asked me in German whethe
r I could - I could 
type a date on the 
envelope, he™s sending a letter. But he had 
such a French accent and I don™t know why I 
said this, so I said, ﬁ
Moi, je parle francais un peu. Donc, si vous voulez, vous pouvez 
parler français.
ﬂ So, he looked at me  as if I came from another world. He said, ﬁHow do 
you know French? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI don™t 
know French. I learned a litt
le bit at school. That™s all 
I know.ﬂ He says, ﬁHow do you know I™m Frenc h
? ﬂ  I said, ﬁBecause you have a French 
accent.ﬂ Anyway, I - I put the addr ess on his envelope. He took it and he says, ﬁThank 
you very mu ch,ﬂ and he went, and I didn™t s
ee him anymore. Then, came a time for us to 
go to like - the train came over, and they
 were putting people, a hundred people - a 
mi ni mu m of a hundred people in each cattle 
wagon, a mi ni mum of a hundred, because I 
know that in some  places there were 125 
people instead of I don™t know how ma ny 
horses they put in a wagon. The train was a sm
a ll train, and it had two little windows with 
bars, and they were closing the doors by 
sliding one door, so I don™t know how ma ny 
horses, ma ybe four or five horses. But we were in the last, like, there were mostly men™s - 
me n™s trains first and then th
ey were ladies™ friends - or 
trains, ladies™ trains. So, we 
happened to go, Renia and Chris and I, happene
d to go in the last train. They pushed us 
in. So, and the train moved and we knew a
nd we heard crying because people were 
fighting with each other. They could only sta
nd. In our wagon - in our train, we could sit 
down. We  c ouldn™t lie down, but we could 
sit down and, you know, whe n the people are 
like that, and they were hungry and thirsty and 
they were fighting with
 each other so we 
heard moans and stuff like that, and the trai
n was very, very slow. So, whe n the train 
moved and this 
Feld Polizei
, they were sitting on the roof
s, you know, they had - they 
were sitting on the roofs of th
e train. They all went with us, as if we were the most 
dangerous criminals. They would because they - they were with guns. Anyway, as we 
were going, it was time  for us to get some  wate
r because at a certain station, they stopped 
the train to get pails of water and to just put
 the pails of water for the people to have 
water, like Renia and Chris - not Renia and 
Krysia, but people - and I tell, the people 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
79 
 
says, ﬁWe didn™t get any water.ﬂ But anyw
ay, this one guy, this guy, this Fr ench guy 
came in and says, ﬁThe girl that speaks Frenc
h.ﬂ I didn™t even get up. 
I forgot that I speak 
French, because I only spoke with him once. S
o, he says, ﬁThe girl that speaks French.ﬂ 
So, I came to this little window and he says, 
ﬁTake a couple of other girls because we  are 
going for water. To bring water for them.ﬂ S
o, he had some  pa ils. So, I called - I thought 
that I took Kr ysia and Renia, but Krysia 
went with me , but Renia says she doesn™t 
reme mber. So, I ma ybe I took - like, I asked a
nother girl, but Krysia 
definitely was with 
me . So, we went for to bring the water. Ev
eryone was getting eith
er one pail or two, I 
don™t reme mber. Anyway, when we came to the well where the water was to be, you 
know, like we pumped the water, he says in French to me , ﬁI am going to let you 
runaway now. You just run when you want. Don™
t worry, I™m going to shoot later. Fi rst, I 
will pretend that I didn™t notice.ﬂ He said it in
 French. ﬁI pretend that I didn™t notice. I 
don™t want you here, run!ﬂ So, I looked at hi
m, and I thought to myself, ﬁ He™s crazy. He™s 
going to - we will run and he will kill us.ﬂ S
o, I said to Chris in Polish, ﬁHe wants us to 
run, but I™m not going to run. I don™t trust hi
m.ﬂ And he said again, ﬁRun, and I™m going 
to shoot. Don™t worry, just run.ﬂ Where ar
e we going to run? We are somewhere all 
strange. We  didn™t know where to go. So, I 
said to Krysia, ﬁI™m not going. I™m going 
back. My father is there,ﬂ and I thought Re
nia wa s with us, but I asked her. So, ma ybe  
Renia was there, so we didn™t want to go. And 
so we went back. He says, ﬁI warned you.ﬂ 

And then he says, ﬁOkay, if you don™t want to 
run away now,ﬂ because I said to him, ﬁI 
don™t have where to run.ﬂ So, he says, ﬁI
f you don™t , but don™t write it down, just 
reme mber, what I™m going to tell you know. Ju
st reme mber. My name  is Leo Bernard. 
My address is Merignan Mine 
(ph). Don™t write it down anywhe
re, but if you ever have a 
chance or any of you have a chance. If you re me mb
er to tell them to
 come, I™ll say - you 
could stay whatever.ﬂ Like, we would 
have an address where to run away.  
 
Q: Hold the story. We  have to stop the tape. 
 
A: This story™s almost finished. 
 
Q: Okay, go ahead. 
 
A: So, anyway we came ba ck. We  didn™t trust hi
m. We stayed there for a long time until we 
came to Aus chwitz. We didn™t trust him. From
 ti me  to ti me , he open the door and he™d 
put a few parcels of some food that he - I 
don™t know - for anybody, and 
this is the end of 
the story. When we came to Auschwitz, he says
, ﬁI warned you, because from here, there 
is..ﬂ He came to me  again and says, ﬁI wa
rned you because there™s no escape from 
anywhere from here.ﬂ And, this is the end. So, when I came to Canada, which was, we 

came to Canada in ™48 - I was thinking about it
. I said, ﬁI wonder whether he told us the 
truth.ﬂ So, 20 years later or so, I wrote a le
tter to this address. I was just wondering 
whether such a person - whether he was lying, 
whether a person like that
 would exist, that 
whether he really wanted to save our lives, 
whether he wanted to shoot us. I was never 
sure, so I thought I would write him a thank 
you letter for his good intentions. I wrote in 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
80 
 
English, and the letter came  back ﬁNo One Unde
r this Nameﬂ So, did he lie?  Did he say 
the truth?  But, he really and truly told us to run. 
 
Q: Okay, we™ll change the tape. 
 
End of Tape #9

Tape #10
 
 
Q: I want to go back to Majowka for just a mo
me nt. I want to ask you whether, as far as you 
reme mber, were there more men in the camp or women?  
 
A: Moreme n. 
 
Q: By a considerable amount? 
 
A: Considerable amount. I would say, let™s take
 a thousand as a unit - 
I would say there was 
700 me n and 300 wome n. I mean, roughly; I™
m just estima ting. Because I go by the 
amount of barracks. There were more me n™s barracks than girls™. 
 
Q: Do you think that™s si
gnificant in any way?  
 
A: Because when they were picking people 
to work, there was more jobs for me n than 
wome n. The r e were very - like the munitions
 factory, I had _______, they had different 
departme nts, but they we re doing, like, iron 
in the hot fire and the wome n couldn™t do 
work like that. So, they had departments li
ke that where you had - you had to have the 
strength for this kind of work. So, there was always more me n than women. 
 
Q: How long do you reme mber the trip being to Auschwitz?  
 
A: I would say that at least we traveled tw
o nights because I remember a day and then a 
night, and I reme mber another day and anothe
r night. So, it™s possible that we came on 
the third day, we came to. I was talking to Reni
a about it. She thinks 
we went there faster, 
but those trains didn™t go fast
. The train didn™t go on a regular
 route. They trains were 
going on side roads and they were very slow
, very slow, and they stopped from time to 
time for crossing, for different things, and I 
reme mber two nights when they closed the 
doors and then when they opened the door slight ly for us to get a little bit of breeze, and 
as you know, on the way to Auschwitz, a lot of people perished. Some  were trampled by 
other people. As a ma tter of fact, my husband™
s br other and father di ed in the - because 
there was so ma ny people, 125 people, and they had to go to the bathroom and they had 

to do, you know, those things were not pr
ovided. I don™t reme mber anymore going for 
water except for this once, and also a lot of
 people jumped the trains and they couldn™t 
have jumped the trains if the train was goi
ng fast. One of them, some  of t hem, like I 
reme mber, but I forgot the name of that 
ma n but I knew him well, but a lot of people 
jumped and they were killed. They we re kille
d because the guards - the canaries - were 
shooting at them, you know, like the train 
was going slow. So, I would say that two 
nights and two and a half days. 
 
Q: Did you have a pail to go to the bathroom?  
 
A: No, we didn™t. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
82 
 
 
Q: So, did you just go?  
 
A: Justgo. 
 
Q: This must have felt horrible. 
 
A: Horrible. The stench was unbelievable. 
 
Q: And were people crying and screami ng?  
 
A: Crying and sc reaming and that™s why they ju
mped, because it didn™t matter to them. They 
jumped the train because it was better to be 
shot then to go wherever, I mean, in such 
conditions. We didn™t where we
 were going, because I believed that we we re going to 
another camp to work, like, to another labor 
camp to work, but that was me . I wanted to 
believe it. But other people, I don™t know 
whether they knew we were going to 
Auschwitz, but some  people prefe
rred to die than to go there. 
 
Q: And, what did this, as you were - what di
d this do to you as you saw people trying to 
escape? 
 
A: We heard - we heard shots and we heard mo
ans and we heard screams. We heard it all, 
all the time, and I mean, you know, it was - th
at was a very traumatic time. Different 
people reacted differently. I reme mb er - I re
me mber Krysia. My hair was shiny and I 
used to wear it like this with a - with a–wh
atever. Krysia used to say, ﬁOh, I™m so sorry 
for you, because if you die with such nice hair.ﬂ 
 
Q: So, you, it was macabre jokes that you... 
 
A: Macabre joke s. But it was, you know, like we 
didn™t know what to expect, where we are 
going. Like, later on we found out that we are 
in Auschwitz, but I mean, we didn™t even 
know how horribl e Auschwitz was, because
 you heard things but you really didn™t 
believe it. 
 
Q: So, had you heard the word Auschwitz?  
 
A: We heard it, but we never believed thatit could be worse than Starachowice camp. Like, 
the camp, consider going - don™t forget they ki
lled us slowly. Firs
t there was the ghetto, 
then was a smaller ghetto, then ther e was the 
camp. So, I mean, we 
couldn™t believe that 
anything could be any worse than we alrea dy went through. Like, you never believed that 

they™re killing people in Ausc
hwitz. You heard about it, 
but you didn™t believe it. 
 
Q: Were you frightened for your father
 as you were riding in the train?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
83 
 
A: I was. Because I - I knew that he wasn™t 
the same  strong ma n as he was before, but we 
were also afraid of us. Like, I was afraid 
that Renia would never survive because - not 
because I was afraid that they would kill he
r or anything, but that she was not healthy 
enough to survive such hard time s. 
 
Q: But, she had already survived a couple of years. 
 
A: She did, but she was still - she was always
 the mo st frightened, because I was very 
daring. I wasn™t afraid. I was daring, but - and 
Krysia, too - but, Renia was always afraid. 
She was always shaking, always afraid. 
 
Q: But neither you, you or Chris were not in the same  way. 
 
A: Not in the same  way. I think that Chris 
was the most realistic person. She organized 
things for us, whether it was food in Auschw
itz or whatever, she was able to do those 
things. I, on the other hand, wasn™t
 afraid of the devil. Like, if they told me  to go right at 
some thing, I wouldn™t have gone. I wasn™t 
afraid because - I don™t know why, but I 
wasn™t. But Renia was - she al
ways was hiding in corners. 
She was always cold. She was 
always sick. So, that was our 
worry, but we were very lucky 
that we kept together. We 
always watched for one another, and I™ll te
ll you that, at a certai
n time when we were 
going to Auschwitz, not - from Auschwitz to
 Ravensbrück, when we were walking the 
death ma rch, if not my si sters - I lost my cons
cious. I didn™t know where I was. I couldn™t 
walk, and I was the tallest. Both of my sist
ers, Renia and Chris almost carried on one 
side. It™s not far anymore , let™s - a few more 
steps, Hania, a few more steps. They save d 
my life, the same  way as , in other mo me nts, I saved their life. 
 
Q: So, Renia is the scared one, the ba
by. Chris is the orga
nized, practical one. 
 
A: Organized,mostpractical, 
she always found us food. She wa
s very, very, very good at 
that way. And she always shared not only with
 us, she shared it with others. And I was a 
devil. I wasn™t afraid of a
nything. I was just not afraid, a
nd I™ll tell you, since I was the 
tallest, there was always a ri
sk that whenever there was a 
selection or they looked for 
some body t o work for a job or whatever, they 
would always - always - even if I was in 
the back. Like, Krysia says, ﬁDon™t stay in the 
front, stay in the bac
k. They™ll take you to 
take blood. They™ll take you to do this.ﬂ So, 
but no matter where I stood they - because I 
was a tall sticking out - so, ﬁThis one.ﬂ 
But, some times it was good and someti mes it 
wasn™t so good.  
 
Q: Does that mean you took risks?  
 
A: I took risks. 
 
Q: Badones?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
84 
 
A: Well, I don™t know if they were. 
 
Q: They obviously didn™t turn out bad. 
 
A: Pardonme ?  
 
Q: They didn™t turn out bad. 
 
A: They didn™t turn out bad becau
se I wasn™t afraid some how.  
 
Q: So– 
 
A: You know I helped us to escape from this
 last, last–but this will be another story. 
 
Q: You arrive in Auschwitz, the doors are open. As
 I understand it, your fa
ther is in the car 
either behind your or in front of you?  
 
A: No, we were in the last car. I think that my
 father was in the car before us, or two before 
us, because I don™t remember whether all the 
women were one after the other or they 
picked a car full of women, then me n and th
en wome n. I don™t know, because we were in 
the last car, and I know that my fathe r  was fa
irly close by. So, Krysia thinks that he was 
in the car right after us. I was under the impression - because we talked about - I was 
under the impression that they kept wo me n sepa
rately so, they must have been in the 
third car, but he was close. 
 
Q: What was it like when the doors were opened?  Was it–? 
 
A: When the doors were opened to go out?  
 
Q: To go out. 
 
A: First of all, we had a very bad experien
ce because the guards that took us before they 
took us to change our dresses and everything, we
 went very close by a crematorium, or if 
that wasn™t a crematorium, we were told it
 was a crematorium. So, I reme mber having a 
bottle of whiskey that this Frenchma n - I forgot to tell you that the Fr enchma n left in 
Auschwitz, he says, ﬁIf they take you to th
e crematorium...ﬂ So, we had this bottle of 
whiskey. I never drank in my life, but all the gi
rls - I told the girls, 
so when they German 
soldiers stopped us in front of the crematoriu
m, or he called this crematorium, so we t ook 
this bottle and every girl had a taste. No
t a taste of it, but you know, like we were 
thinking that we™re going to die now so le
t™s just be me rry. We  never drank in our 
lifetimes, but the whole bottle went. Like, as far 
as it went from us, and then they took us 
to the pl ace where they cut our hair, and afte
r that he stayed with us there for a few 
mi nutes to scare us or to whatever - to what
ever, and then they took us to the place where 
we had to leave everything we had, to put on 
the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
85 
 
with stripes, and they cut our hair. This is 
another story how I suffered the most out of all 
of three of us. And, then we went to the 
barrack. So, I™ll tell you 
ma ybe how they first 
brought us in and told us to take all our cl
othes off and they put 
nothing else, we had no 
brassiere, this I reme mber - because I was so - 
it felt so st range to just  have the dress on - 
and they gave us the dress. The dress was too 
short on me , so there was a small girl that I 
don™t know who, we changed dresses to fit us
. Because we were all very skinny, but 
nobody was as tall as I. They were mostly sma
ller people. So, there were just a few long 
dresses. I was glad that some body e xchanged wi
th me  the dress. Then, they cut our hair 
to here. They checked our hair for lice. They
 put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever 
you call it, in our hair and on our
 bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I reme mb er, 
they took away my shoes. So, they gave us
 such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this 
was a case where the wooden shoes - we were 
already in dresses and men from another 
camp were distributing the shoes, and the guy sa
ys, ﬁTake it, take it.ﬂ To me  like, in 
Polish we have - like in English you sa
y ﬁyouﬂ it means everything, but do you 
understand French or Ge rman?  So, they say ﬁvousﬂ or ﬁtuﬂ or in German they said - they 
say, because here you say ﬁyouﬂ, in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her 
ﬁDouﬂ(ph), you caller her ﬁVuﬂ like, and the gu
y says, ﬁTake those, take those.ﬂ We ll I 
just said, ﬁHow dare you calling me  ‚dou™? ﬂ  Ok
ay, it was so stupid. And, then so anyway 

I put those dresses - I couldn™t walk in them, a
nd then they put us five people in a row to 
ma rch to the barracks. So, we were five, and 
so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there 
was three others. They didn™t want to part 
and we didn™t want to part. So, this woma n 
goes, she says, ﬁWhat™s the commotion?  The 
couple there.ﬂ You know, I just came  to a 
new camp. I  didn™t like the way guy says to me
 ﬁDou,ﬂ and here she screams at me . I 
wasn™t really used to it because you know nobody really mi streated me  when I worked 
before, and she says, ﬁGo to the back.ﬂ I sa
y, ﬁI™m not going to the back.ﬂ She says - I 
say, ﬁThose are my two sisters.ﬂ She didn™t ev
en want to hear. She took me by the hair, 
grabbed me  by the hair, to the German ma n th
ere that was cutting th
e hair, and she says, 
ﬁMake a cross on her head.ﬂ So, you know, she wa
s ma d that I talked back to her. So, 
first he ma de the cross, and then he felt so
rry for me  and he shaved my he ad, but I was 
the only one with a really shaved head of 
hair. You know, like, I didn™t have anything on 
my head - just - I don™t k
now whether I looked like a boy 
or whatever. Anyway, finally 
we just didn™t want to be pa
rted and I didn™t care what she 
says. She couldn™t kill me , like 
I was daring. I said, ﬁI™m not going, they are my two sisters. I™m going wi th them.ﬂ So, 
she got ma d. She pushed us. Anyway, we™re toge
ther. I didn™t want to part from the m, 
because if I went to the back or whatever, I 
mean, it wasn™t the next row - we would have 
never been together. When we came to the barrack– 
 
Q: Can we go back before you get to the barrack?  
 
A: Right.Right. 
 
Q: Is the sequence that you get your 
hair cut - you take off your clothes– 
 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
86 
 
 
Q: Then you get your hair cut?  
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And, then you get a tattoo, a
nd then you get the clothes. 
 
A: Oh, but you know, when did I get it there?  When did I get the tattoo?  After we had the 
shower, after we had the shower, and we got 
the dress, we went there and we got the 
tattoo. Before we went to the barrack - so, I mu
st have had already my hair - I must have 
had my hair cut short already. I - I was al
ready with shaven head. I was the only one. 
Everybody had had hair to here because, you 
know, when we went to - they wouldn™t 
have touched us. This is my logic now - th
ey wouldn™t have touched us before they 
disinfected us. Don™t forget when we were 
- when we went under the shower, we shed 
our clothes and we got whatever clothes to
 put on. We  were already, like, we were 
already clean. It was after the wash. They spra
yed such a horrible thing on us. It smelled 
horribl e, and it was stinging us because it wa
s against - I don™t know against what - a 
disinfectant. So, I™m positive that  they woul
dn™t have touched our hair if we didn™t go 
through disinfection before. That™s my l
ogic now; I don™t reme mber the sequence. 
 
Q: Do you remember that it was me n who cut your hair?  
 
A: Yeah, I reme mber that a German cut my hair. 
 
Q: AGer manwhat?  
 
A: A Ger man ma n - soldier. 
 
Q: Asoldier. 
 
A: He must have been a barber. He mus t  ha
ve - a German soldier shaved my head. I don™t 
reme mber who cut my hair or - because th
at was a routine. Li ke, everybody was just 
getting their hair cut, but this one was a 
punishme nt for being disobedient, for talking 
back to the 
kapo
.  
 
Q: After you got your tattoo and the dres
s, do you reme mber getting the tattoo?  
 
A: Ido. 
 
Q: Did it hurt?  
 
A: No, it was like - like with a needle, that™s what
 it was. It didn™t hurt, but as if you put a lot 
of needles all the time, and we have numbers. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
87 
 
Q: Sequential. 
 
A: Yeah. I have 1736 or some thing and Krysia 
has the next number and Reina has the next 
number. 
 
Q: You had 14176, Krysia has 14177– 
 
A: Yeah and Renia has– 
 
Q: Has14178. 
 
A: Yeah, I reme mber that we had numbers one after another. 
 
Q: When you got - you remember getting striped - all of you got striped?  
 
A: All of them. 
 
Q: Did you then get a patch to sew on?  
 
A: You know that I don™t reme mber, but we had 
a patch there. No, we 
didn™t have - we had 
yellow patches. The Polish people had - a triangle. 
 
Q: Onetriangle? 
 
A: Onetriangle. 
 
Q: With a bar above it?  
 
A: Was it a bar above it? I don™t reme mber, 
but that was a triangle. So, that wa s in 
Auschwitz. 
 
Q: Did you wear it here?  Did you wear it– 
 
A: No, I wore it on my sleeve because in th
e last camp, we had red ones because we had 
regist ered as Poles, but this is - in this 
camp, we had yellow, yellow triangles. I reme mber 
having the lower part here and like this. It wa
sn™t a white armband, this was in the ghetto. 
 
Q: Did you have to sew this on, the triangle?  Do you reme mber? 
 
A: I don™t reme mber. Most likel
y, but I didn™t have a needle, 
but ma ybe it was a glue that 
they glued it on. I don™t know. I don™t reme
mber , but we wore yellow triangles. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether they knew your 
names?  Wa s there a list of all of you who 
went to Auschwitz?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
88 
 
 
A: I think that, when they gave us the tatt
oo, they wrote down the na
me and the number, and 
from there on we were numbers. There were no name s. 
 
Q: So, there was an identity card in the– 
 
A: No, we didn™t get a card, but when theyregist ered us, because  the Starachowice group 
came separately, and the Starachowice groups 
came separately. All Starachowice groups 
have this number, you know, like one after another, and I forgot what you asked me . 
 
Q: Well, I asked you - identity is th
e wrong word. It™s a registration card. 
 
A: We didn™t have a card. 
 
Q: Right, but there was a 
registration that was– 
 
A: They just wrote our name s. They wrote down our numbers, and from there on, we had no 
name s. Like, we called each other by the name
, but if they called - if they called you for 
some  reason, they called you by the number. 
 
Q: Now, did people recognize you when you got your– 
 
A: Now I™ll tell you the story. I, myself - okay, 
we came  in. The y gave us a barrack, three 
rows of bunks, bigger bunks than we had, but I 
would say six - five to six people slept. 
We had to sleep like sardines. One this wa
y, one this way, one this way, because - and 
they were boards, just boards, because 
in camp in Starachowice, we had straw 
underneath. Here, you know, like it 
was a straw sack with straw inside. So, it wasn™t so 
bad. This was on the bare thing and we - ther
e wasn™t enough room to sleep one way. We  
had to have the heads one way– But now I™m
 going back, because when we arrived, 
there was a little window similar enough to 
the wi ndows without bars
, but similar to the 
window in the train that I told you, a small ju
st to let some  light in. So, I , you know, I™m 
tall, so I stood there and I see - I see there™
s a man there, and I l
ooked at - I looked, it was 
myself, but I didn™t know. So, I say, ﬁMan!ﬂ 
I looked out this way. I don™t see any ma n, 

but then I looked in the mi rror, and there™s 
a man there. So, I started moving my head. I 
realized that™s me . I didn™t recognize myself
. I would never believe. I was very skinny at 

the time  and very tall, and my head looke
d like a pin drop, like with the hair, you know, 
my head was very small by comparison. Li
ke, I couldn™t recognize myself, and it was 
funny because one day I was walking the 
streets and, you know, the me n was comi ng - 
were comi ng to do the toilets in the ladies™ - 
the ladies didn™t clean 
- it wasn™t a toilet - 
how do you call it when th
ere are only holes?   
 
Q: Thelatrine. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
89 
 
A: The latrines. The me n were comi ng to clean
 the latrine and one of our guys, a boy from 
Germany - I reme mber his name, Lothar - he 
was picked to clean th
e toilets. So, he came 
in and he saw me . He was so happy. He come s,
 he says, ﬁTell Hania that your father is 
alive.ﬂ I looked at him and I was so vain, I 
didn™t tell him for a mi nute that I was Hania, 
because I didn™t want anybody to know that I 
looked like that. He didn™t - I don™t know - 
I don™t know. I didn™t ask him, but I came home and I said, ﬁI™m so glad he didn™t 
recognize me.ﬂ Like, people are stupid. I mea
n, I™m talking about myself. So, then we 
went into the barrack. The barrack wa
s run by four people. There was the 
Lager Älteste
, 
which was responsible for the barrack. Ther
e were two thousand people going in one 
barrack, you can imagine how ma
ny people. So, there was the 
Lager Älteste
. She was a 
Czechoslovakian girl. Her name  wa
s Yolichka (ph). Then there was a 
Shreiberin
 who had 
a job like I had. She kept records who went
 to work, and she was doing all the office 
work. Her name  was Felicia Berlant (ph). She™
s still alive. She save
d our lives. She was 
the 
Shreiberin
. Then there were two 
Steuben Älteste
. The barrack was divided in four and 
each 
Steuben Älteste
 which was responsible for this part
 - for like two parts of the barrack 
on this side, and two parts of the barrack on 
that side. She kept, she kept, she ma de us 
clean the places where you slept. She ma
de us responsible for, responsible for 
cleanliness, that™s all, and order in the place
s. When we arrived, this Yolichka (ph) spoke 
Czech to us, but we understood. This Fela Berl
ant (ph), she got the job because she could 
scream the most and she had a language sim
ilar to Vaschek (ph). So, when we arrived 
and we didn™t stay straight she says, ﬁYou–ﬂ 
- I have to translate 
it because - ﬁQuiet, you 
whores from Starachowice.ﬂ She didn™t call 
us any other - not that she wa s bad. She 
saved our lives and ma ny other people
. She was a good woman, but otherwise she 
wouldn™t have had the job if she didn™t speak 
like that. She called us names of all sorts. 
And when we arrived, and we got the job, we 
were working outside the camp, outside the 
camp, and we were cutting bulrushes in we
tland. So, we stood always in cold water, 
wetland, cutting, and those - we had those knivesthat the Germans gave us at the place of 
work already, that we had to
 cut, but it was so woody, like 
it was so hard. It was the 
hardest job I ever had. My hands were bleed
ing because the bulrushes when they grow 
for such a long time, they become  woody, and to 
cut it with a knife it™s very hard. He had 
- he had german shepherds, like he took us 
to work. We cut it. 
We were cutting those 
bushes, two german shepherds - like, I don™
t know how ma ny of the guards were there 
that took us, but two huge german shepherds 
and as a ma tter of fact, the first day he 
taught me  a lesson. Of course, I was picked be
cause I was tall again. So, he wanted to 
show us that if - because we were outside
 the camp and the reason why they were cutting 
those bushes because they wanted to clean up th
e barbed wire walls in or de r, if somebody 

wanted to run away and hide there or if there 
was a partisan attack or some  attack, so they 
could hide in those bulrushes. So, we had to cut them. So, he  wanted to show us what 
would happen to everybody - to anybody that in tends to run away. So, he called his dog 
and he told him to - he told him to start b
iting my dress, and he must have told him in 
German, because he didn™t touch me. He just
 tear my dress to pi
eces, and of course, I 
froze because I am afraid of dogs, like especially touch, you know, the me an dogs that 

bark so, and the teeth were so bad, and he 
stopped at him at a certain time  and started 
again. So, the dog didn™t bite me , but he bit, 
like, my dress was in shreds. I got another 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
90 
 
dress from Fela when I went back. But, that
 was a time when I was really scared, ve ry 
scared, because I thought the dog was going to ki
ll me . So, I just stood there, and so we 
worked there for three m
onths. Aft e r three months– 
 
Q: Let me  ask you some thing. Did you take your shoes off, the wooden shoes?  
 
A: Yeah, no, I - I didn™t have any other s
hoes. I had to wear the wooden shoes. 
 
Q: So, you wore the wooden shoes in the ma rshes?  
 
A: In the ma rshes - no, in the ma rshes we took off the shoes. 
 
Q: So, you were barefoot?  
 
A: And, as a matter of fact, we even washed our
 dresses as much because we didn™t get them 
so often, ma ybe every two weeks or so. We  didn™t go to showers every day, you know, 
the showers - I™ll tell you a st
ory about, a separate story, but when I came  home  Fela gave 
me  right away another dress. So, that was okay.  
 
Q: One second - how are we doing?  Okay let™
s change the tape. You had showers there?  
 
A: Not showers, we went every week they took 
us to such a place where they were - once a 
week we went– 
 
End of Tape #10 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411

Tape #11
 
 
Q: Okay. We  were talking about the ma rshe
s and the dog, but you were
 also beginning to 
talk about the fact that you had, not 
exactly showers, but you could wash. 
 
A: Yeah, we were going to - I 
don™t - in Birkenau, in another section, where they had a place 
where most likel y they were taki ng the inma
tes - I call them inmates - regularly, once a 
week or once every ten days, whatever ti
me , you know, and we were going to those 
things to have showers. S
o, I don™t know how oft e n I did 
that, I don™t remember, but I 
think once a week or once every ten days. Wh
en we arrived there, we undressed, they 
took our clothes, they put it through the same
 function, like they gave us - okay, what 
they had to do to put this stuff to disinfect al
l the dresses. So, they gave us - they took 
another bunch that they alre
ady disinfected from another 
group, and they gave it to us, 
and we had a new dress, but each time  it was a new old dress. Each time, I had to fight to 
get the longest, but I was very lucky. Th
e girls always cooperated with me  because 
otherwise they would have to have a dress 
like this. So, that wa s the procedure. So, 
whenever we went there, German soldiers would come  - like, we would be - I mean, this 

wasn™t in the plan, but I think 
that was the character that they
 wanted to do it - they would 
come  to the room where we were, and they 
would take a hose with 
cold water, put it on 
the highest tension, and they would just not on
ly tease the girls, but they would come  and 
they would just try to spray you with this - wi
th all the force in your private parts. If you 
screamed or you danced, they did worse to you. So, we knew that we had to stand still. 

We had to disregard it. We had to say nothing, 
just stand there and pr
etend that it doesn™t 
happen to you. So, that - so, we weren™t looki
ng forward to the showers so much because 
we had to suffer, and nobody - I™m sure that it 
wasn™t like, it wasn™t meant to be like that, 
but they did it. 
 
Q: Do you remember which barrack you were in?  
 
A: Yeah, 20–20. My sister thinks 
it was 25, but I think it was 20. 
 
Q: Have you ever looked 
at a ma p of Auschwitz?  
 
A: I never went back. I couldn™t do it. Like, my sister– 
 
Q: No, a ma p?  Not going there. 
 
A: I didn™t look. No, I didn™t look. I™m a l most 
positive it™s 20, because I trust my me mor y, 
but my sister thinks it™s 
25. Krysia thinks it™s 25. 
 
Q: Well, I™ll see if I can find out where Fe
la Berlant (ph) and this other woman were. 
 
A: Because we - we differ on that, because I re
me mb er - because Miles went  to - went to - 
when he got the barrack, he wanted our barr
ack, and I was under the impression that they 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
92 
 
gave him, our barrack. I™m not sure, but he said that when they offered to give him a 
barrack for the museum, and he said when he 
goes there, he™s going to ask for it, because 
they don™t care which barrack. They had to dism
antle it anyway to send it to - so, he says 
he will try to get our barrack. Whethe
r he did or  not, I coul dn™t tell you. 
 
Q: Weren™t you in quarantine for a m
ont h before you went to this barrack?  
 
A: You know, that I don™t reme mber. I don™t reme mber. 
 
Q: So, your recollection is goi
ng directly to this barrack?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So, you don™t recollect sitti
ng around for a couple of week
s doing practically nothing. 
 
A: No. I reme mber that we had to - I don™t 
know whether it was the next day, but it was soon 
after we came , we got this job. 
 
Q: Do you recall when you discovered 
the real truth about Auschwitz?  
 
A: Rightaway. 
 
Q: Right away, and you believed it? 
 
A: I believed it. I believed it. 
 
Q: So, this is the first time 
the thought you had in your head about what was going on was 
really destroyed?  
 
A: Yeah, because we - the crematorium,  we felt 
it. The stench of the, like, it was very easy 
because we met other girls from different barr
acks, and the st ench from the crematorium, 
you know, the bones burning and the hair burning a
nd the heat and the fire that was going 
out from the r e. So, we knew that people - 
I even knew - I reme mber, some one told me  
that 3,000 people can go into one of those crematoriums after they are gassed, apparently, 

that™s what I was told. I was never inside
, but I™ll repeat what
 I was told, that 3,000 
people can be put at one time into the gas ch
amber, and apparently after they™re gassed, 
the floor opens and they go, and the fire starts
 burning. So, they don™t handle it, they only 
handle ashes. They don™t handle the bodies. Th
at™s what I was told, and I asked - I 
reme mber, they told me  3,000 people at one time.  
 
Q: And this was just another prisoner in the camp that told you this. 
 
A: Yeah, another woma n pr isoner from - ma ybe 
Fela told us or ma ybe Yolichka (ph), or 
ma ybe one of those that were a little bit long
er, the girls that worked there. They could 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
93 
 
have told us, but I reme mber asking and th
at was the answer I got, and I could smell it 
myself all day, every day. 
 
Q: Could you see fire?  
 
A: Yes. I mean, from the chimneys. I didn™t see 
fire as fire, but they 
had such long chimneys 
and some  flames were comi ng out, and they we
re ma king the air impossible, like it was 
impossible to breath. 
 
Q: And were ashes comi ng down on your clothes?  
 
A: Idon™tremember. 
 
Q: So, how long was it - well, first of all, how 
was your treatment in this barrack?  Wa s the– 
 
A: I™ll tell you what. This Fela took care of us
 i mme diately. She liked
 - I think she liked 
Krysia the most. I don™t care, but she was sogood to us, whenever she had an extra piece 
of bread or some thing, if she had some thing, th
e three girls - she just - she just was, I 
mean, as bad as she was - ma ybe she wasn™t bad. She had a huge, big mo uth. She 

screamed, because ot herwise she wouldn™t ha ve had a job. 
 
Q: And, where was she from?  Do you know?  
 
A: Yeah, she was from Helm (ph). I know, b
ecause I just saw her. I™m - we are friends 
because she really saved our lives, really sa
ved our lives, and I™ll 
tell you right away how. 
So, anyway, when we were there for three months working so hard, she tried to always 
give me  a better dress, or you know, if she had some thing that was special, she would 
always give it to us and really
 treat us a little better then
 she treated ev
erybody else. And 
then, one time, there was a Polish uprising 
in Warsaw, not Jewish, Polish uprising, and 
they caught all the people - Polis
h girls to - that they caught, 
that they thought that took 
part in this uprising, ma ybe me n, too, but th
ey came to Auschwitz, and they were Polish 
people, so they didn™t go to 
crematorium and they didn™t go 
to a barrack where they send 
them to hard labor, and what they did - wh
atever they brought with
 them, the suitcases 
and everyt hing, every piece of clothes had to be
 recorded, and when they - and they had 
red triangles - and when they finished their sentence, because they were not convicted for 

life or taken to camp like that, but when they 
fi nished the verdict fo
r two months, half a 
year, a year, they were getting the clothes wa
shed and ironed, and they went home. So, at 
that time, Jews never worked in this depa
rtme nt, only Polish people, but because of the 
fact that Polish people we re comi ng and they
 didn™t want any problems, they needed 20 
girls to go there, to write dow
n the, you know, to sort out th
e clothes, to wr ite down the 
clothes, to hang up the clothes, to wash the la
undry and stuff like that. So, they decided to 
take 20 Jewish girls from our - from -  and of course the 
Shreiberin
 got the order - the fi rst 
two of us, she picked me  and Krysia right away, and she had the 20 girls because we 
begged her to take - to give Renia. She™s like
, ﬁI can™t. This is office work. She looks - 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
94 
 
she™s too young. They want - they will neve
r take her.ﬂ So, we begged her and begged 
her. So, she went to Yolichka (ph) who was the 
Lager Älteste
 - the barrack 
Ältest e
, and 
she asked her. She said, ﬁ Well, all I can do 
is to ask the German.ﬂ You know, the German 
guy that™s going to pick them up if he agrees
, but she says, ﬁI can™t take all of them, 
because they need 20 people.ﬂ So, anyway we 
were so nervous, I reme mber, the German 
came in. Fela was there standing, and Yolichka 
(ph) went to the German s oldier who was 
transporting us to the new job, and she said to
 him, ﬁThere™s three sisters, the youngest is 
the best, but she looks a little bit small,
 but she isn™t that young. She only looks young 
and she™s the best of them all. She can 
organize–ﬂ I don™t know what happened to the 
German. He said yes for Reina. She brought her in. She was the 21
st
, that never happened 
before. I don™t know whether it was pure luck or
 whether it was Fela 
who did that for us, 
or whether it was Yolichka (ph)
 that did it for us, or whethe
r the German just felt sorry 
for whatever reason. We  were transported to anew life. First of all, when we came there, 

this departme nt wasn™t for Jews. So, ever
yone - although we slept,
 I don™t know, ten in 
one room, but we had - we had cots for separa
te, like, it was also three ﬁfloorsﬂ I call it, 
but they were single. They were single, 
and they had sheets a
nd everything, like no 
appels
, can you imagine?  No - I di
dn™t tell you a story about 
appels
 before. No 
appels
 of 
any kind because there wa s only 20 of us, and so
me of the Polish girls, they left  a few 
Polish girls to teach us how to do the work. 
Some  of them, we  found out after the war, 
they were Jewish but they were on Polish pape
rs - some  of them. With one, Krysia is in 
contact with one Polish gi
rl she™s in contact with lived - 
that worked there. That was the 
best job we could get. The Polish girls were
 comi ng. They gave us the stuff. In their 
presence, we wrote down everything they had. 
We put it in a sack. The sack was hanging 
there with their number. And, when they were
 going out, we had to
 wash and iron their 
stuff, but we - we weren™t there long enough to
 wash and iron, but we were taught to do 
that. So, it was the best job. There was 21 gi
rls that had - I mean, we weren™t there too 

long because we went there ma ybe in Nove mber and in January we were transpor ted 
some where else, but I didn™t believe it™s Auschw
itz. It was the best job and I said now 
that we were so lucky, because can you imagine, there was so ma ny of us, and we were 
lucky, the three of us, that we
 got this job in Auschwitz. I mean, it was the best possible 
because it wasn™t meant for Jews. It just ha
ppened that they needed - they didn™t want  
Polish girls doing it.  
 
Q: I gather this was a shock to 
you that there would be protective 
kommandos
 in Auschwitz. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In certain places, there would be no selections. 
 
A: No– 
 
Q: Because there was no selection in– 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
95 
 
A: Not with us. We  had to stand 
appel 
every morning, four o™clock,five o™clock. It was dark 
when we out for
 appel
 in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. But in
 here, we didn™t have to do it 
because, when they brought - like, we  had to work at any time they brought the - when 
they arrived. When they arrived, we had to 
take their stuff away. They went to sauna, 
because there were the saunas were. As a matte
r of fact, as a ma tter of fact, I remi nded 
myself now, that from camp, people were comi ng and you know what we were doing for 

them, like when they were comi ng for - to 
the saunas?  We  took, like for drinking water 
we had such - it wasn™t a pail, it was such a 
thing with a spout - so, we would steal from 
the Polish - from the Polish bags or suitcases or
 whatever a pair of underwear, a brassiere, 
because, you know, whatever we could put
. We  went for water, nobody asked us 
anything. We didn™t have any Germa n people su
pervising us. It was an easy job. So, we 
went there for water, and then whatever we 
had in the pitcher - it was a big pitcher what 
we were getting drinking water from. So, 
we would go there and distribute it to the 
Starachowice girls, and whoever wanted anyt
hing. So, we would - whatever we could 
steal fr om the Polish gi rls we gave it to them. 
 
Q: Hania, do you recall where the 
Effektenkammer
 was in relationship to where the last 
barrack you were at was?  North 
of that?  It™s in Birkenau?  
 
A: In Birkenau. It was called - I know in Polish what it was called. 
 
Q: Say it in Polish. 
 
A: 
Rozowy effekt
. Pink 
effekt
 because they were where the Jews where when they took all 
the clothes was it was called Kanada, and it was Red 
effekt
,
 
but they - we didn™t work in 
this departme nt. This was for specifically, 
not for gentile, but Po
lish people, you know, 
this one, from the - ma ybe it was another de
partment there - but after the uprising in 
Warsaw by the Polish people, very ma ny were arrested. So, that was - it was called 

Rozowy effekt
, which means Pink 
effekt
, whatever it was. The other was called Red 
effekt
, 
and it was called Kanada. I don™t know why. 
 
Q: And it was near the saunas. 
 
A: The sauna was there because, I reme mber, 
at first I didn™t reme mber where we were 
going, but I reme mbered that those people 
were comi ng. I reme mb
er ____™s sister, she 
wanted a powder box. I said, ﬁWhere would I find a powder box? ﬂ 
 
Q: A powder box?  
 
A: Well, she wanted such a box to put po
wder in, with powder. But, you know, it was 
strange but I mean, when you are in camp a
nd you think that they could get anything, 
ma ybe just to look at it. But that was the best  job we had, because we 
didn™t have to stand 

appel
. We  had enough food because there was only
 20 of us. The Polish girls that were 
there were getting parcels from home , and 
I reme mber they had onions, and the parents 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
96 
 
were sending them stuff, food that was calle
d like very nutritious, 
because we didn™t get 
any apples or pears or anything. So, when 
the parents would send, and the Polish girls 
were allowed to get parcels from home , and th
is girl Ioasha (ph) 
who is still alive and 
Krysia with her in contact all the time, sh
e found her when they went to Warsaw. When 
she got a parcel, she always shared it with 
us. So, we weren™t - in addition to the br ead 
and the soup that we were getting, in this 
camp - we weren™t there too long, in this 
barrack - but we were there all I say from
 the end of Nove mbe r  until January the 18
th
, a 
couple of months, because we arrived in Ausc
hwitz in July, and so we were there July, 
August, September, October, November - five 
months. I said three months - five months 
in Auschwitz where we did the bulrushes, a
nd then the two and a ha
lf mo nths in this 
place or  two months. 
 
Q: So, did this bring back strength to you?  
 
A: Yes, it did, because we didn™t see any Germ
ans, like, there was only the supervisor  and 
the supervisor was the Polish girl who wa
s really Jewish, but there she was nobody. She 
had a Polish name . She, as a ma tter of f
act, she wrote a book about Auschwitz and she 
told - in the book she says her name  was La
ndau, but there was Jevulska (ph). She had a 
Polish name . She was from - because  there was just a few Polish girls that were 
supervisor s because before that there were ot
her girls, but as I said, after the Wa rsaw 
uprising, they wanted Jews there. 
 
Q: Does Renia get better, as far as you™
re concerned?  Does she actually work?  
 
A: She worked. She worked very - she was so 
efficient, believe me . Renia did the same  job 
as we did, because once she got there, she 
was treated - nobody bothered with her. She 
worked very well. As a ma tter of fac t , sh
e was a very good worker. She wa s one of the 
best. 
 
Q: So, did she - did you see her star
t getting stronger
 at that point?  
 
A: She was always a physical weakling. Shewas never very strong. Ever since she was a 
child, she always was susceptibl
e to different sicknesses.  
 
Q: So, how did you find out that the 
camp was going to be evacuated?  
 
A: We were told that, on the 18
th
 of January, we are going west, 
because whatever it was, we 
knew that the Russians were very close. As 
a ma tter of fact, we were told that the 
Russians were 70 kilome ters from Auschwitz, 
and they were sending the people west to 
Bergen-Belsen and to all sorts of camps, but
 first we had to go through Ravensbrück. So, 
that was the death ma rch because the trains - 
it wa s, the weather was very bad. The trains 
didn™t go fast enough. It was very cold on the 18
th
 of March. On the 18
th
 of March, we 
left  Auschwitz. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
97 
 
Q: No, the 18
th
 of January. 
 
A: Sorry,18
th
 of January. I don™t know why I said March. On the 18
th
 of Ja nuary, I said, it 
was snowing and blowing, on the 18
th
 of January we went to Ravensbrück. I™m sorry. We  
went to Ravensbrück, and the train wa s going 
slow, and part of it we were walking, and 
my shoes were all frozen. I couldn™t put them 
on. I had to put them in the car in the train. 
I put - to wear my shoes to just be able 
to slip them on because they, you know, when I 
took them off to - for the night, 
I couldn™t open them. And, then we– 
 
Q: What kind of shoes did you have when you left the 
Effektenkammer
? 
 
A: Later, we got other shoes.
 I™ll tell you, when we came to the - to the pl ace where we 
worked with - the last place, we could pick up any shoes there and put my shoes. 
 
Q: The 
Effektenkammer
, you were able to choose shoes. 
 
A: Yeah,that™strue. 
 
Q: But, let me  ask you some thing, you had be
gun to describe that on the death ma rch, you 
began to fall asleep, but Renia also describe
s that she thinks for the whole time, until you 
got on the train, she was sleeping. 
 
A: That™s possible, too, because I reme mber that
 if not my sisters - 
I couldn™t walk. I was 
dragging my feet and I saw pict
ures that didn™t exist. I 
saw horses and people, ma ybe I 
had a bad - a bad vision there, but I couldn™
t ha ve had, because I started so long I was 
working, always was working like this. So, I 
saw things that didn™t exist. And, if my 
sisters wouldn™t have kept me , I don™t thi
nk I would have survived. Maybe Renia had 
____, or ma ybe I woke up a little and we carried
 Renia. That was the - then you saw so 
ma ny dead people because the Germans were pu
shing us to go west with their dogs, and 
whoever couldn™t go, they would just shooting,
 like they couldn™t - and, you saw those 
people. One person was sitting under a tree 
- was sitting there. He was dead, and you 
know, what the worst part was that the peopl
e that were walking were taking the shoes 
and the - when they saw a dead person, quick
ly they would get the jacket or whatever 
they could grab. Nobody worried about it - what 
shoes or whatever th
ey could get quickly 
so the Germans wouldn™t send the 
dogs after them, and they wa
lked - we just disregarded 
all the - the dead people. But 
to me , the ma n that was sitting under the tree, he looked so 
real and so alive and he  was 
dead. Maybe, he just sat down to die. Then, we came  to 
Ravensbrück, I don™t know, three days later, 
two days later. I don™t know exactly what 
date it was, and there was no room for us 
in the barracks, and it 
was freezing and it was 
snowing, so we had to stay outside - sleep outs
ide. So, we slept in the snow together, like 
we just warmed each other from the bodies
, you know, with our bodies, we just warmed 
each other, and slept in the snow. Then, in th
e morning, we di dn™t get anyt hing to eat. So, 
we took this dirty snow - most of the times, 
we took the snow from trees or something - 
and we drank it and ate it. For three days, we
 had no meat - because they didn™t ha ve  any

room. From every side the people were sent
 to Ravensbrück. They didn™t have - they 
didn™t even register us. They didn™t even write
 our name s. So, after three days, they send 
us to a camp called Retzow, which was– 
 
Q: Wait a second - isn™t it the case that 
some body a sked for your name s and you decided 
you weren™t - one of you decided that you 
were not going to say a Jewish name . 
 
A: No, that was– 
 
Q: You said ﬁGorska.ﬂ Or 
is that only in Retzow. 
 
A: I think it was in Retzow. I™l
l tell you in a mi nute how it was, 
but I have to remi nd mys e lf 
whether it was in Ravens - no, it was - we 
were there three days
, I don™t reme mber. I 
thought that they didn™t register
 us, only in Retzow. But I will tell you this story. Now, I 
get confused. I would have to 
ask them. When we stood in line
 to be registered, I think it 
was in Retzow, but I could be
 wrong, ma ybe they did register us and that was in 
Ravensbrück. We  decided, like I 
told my sisters that if the Germans - the Russians were 
70 kilome ters from Ausc hwitz, and sound away 
(ph) fire in Auschwitz, like before we 
were moved, we were taken on the death ma
rch there to Ravensbrück, we saw fire. And 
some body t old us that they are burning all 
the records. You know, and I believed it was 
true, because the Russians were so close, they
 didn™t want to have the records. So, we 
said - I said to my sisters, ﬁ We can save our
 lives by pretending we 
are Polish.ﬂ So, Chris 
had a boyfriend; his name was Kleinbur
g. Kleinburg is a small mountain, you know, 
that™s what it means in German, like, if you tr
anslate it. So, she translated it into Polish: 
ma la gorska. I said, ﬁThat™s too long. Who is
 going to...?  Let™s eliminate the ‚mala™ and 
we™ll have the ‚gorsky™, ‚gor
ska™.ﬂ So, we had to reme mber, what was the mother™s 
name . So, my mother™s name  was Pola Blum
 - Ta nnenblum, but they were called Blum. 
So, I said, in Polish, a 
blum
 is a flower, it™s like 
fiatek, 
so Fiatekosky, because if it was 
fiatek
, you couldn™t say 
fiatek
. What was your father™s name ?  So, we said ﬁGorskyﬂ 
because our name  was Gorsky, and the first name , his name  was Isaac, so we said ﬁAnjeﬂ 
because Anje was such a typical peasant Polish na me . So, we gave this name  to them. 
Then if they asked us any other questions, we
 have to reme mber that we are Polish; we 
are never Jewish. And of course, when we registered, we got the re
d, the red triangles. 
That means political prisoners, so, you know
. And imme diately, when we arrived, I met 
some people that I knew, and they didn™t want to
 talk to me because 
they had the yellow - 
we call it 
winkl
e (ph) - yellow triangle and we had the red one, and they didn™t want to 
cause any problems for us that are Jewish and we
 are Polish, so they didn™t talk to us, but 
later we told them not to worry about it. When
 we arrived in Re tzow 
- this is very, not a 
very interesting, but that™s
 again a personal story. 
 
Q: Let™s pause for a mo me nt because  I think we only have a little bit of time left.

Q: We™re in Retzow. What™s happening in Retzow?  
 
A: So, we arrived in Retzow, I think we regist
ered there, and then we lined up for work. So, 
the ma n in charge - I don™t know his name
, but I know his title. It™s a mouthful: 
Haupstunshauführer
 (ph), and he had - there was a 
barrack, the German barrack where 
they worked, and it was this 
Haupstunshauführer
 (ph) and then they were 
kapos
, women, 
and then they were guards in the camp. What 
we did there was when we arrived there, he 
lined us up for work. He needed about, I would say, 12 people I think or so to clean the 
German barracks. Some  people were going 
out to work. I don™t know what they did 
because we were either too short and I wasn™t
 working outsi de . So, first of all, the cook 
came in and he picked Kr ysia. That was the 
biggest, you know, as if she won the lottery 
because - because if she is goi
ng to work in the kitchens, we would have what to eat 

because we just come from a place where we didn™t eat for three days, and from 

Auschwitz where the food was so scarce that 
we were fainting most of the times. So, 
Krysia got the job in the kitchen. Then, they 
started picking people to
 clean the barracks. 
The Germans - those were the best jobs, 
don™t mi sunderstand me , the best jobs. So, 
anyway, he picked me  fi rst, and he starte
d picking people and Renia got also in this 
group. So, then he showed where we are going to
 live and so on, and then he showed - he 
told us where we are going to work. So, he pick
ed me  to work in his office. So, I figured, 
what am I going to do here in the office. 
I - I thought I™m going to be a secretary or 
some thing. So, he come s in and he tells me  - he asks me , ﬁ
Kannst du putzen?
ﬂ ﬁDo you 
know how to clean?ﬂ I think myself, ﬁOf courseI know - that™s the best job I could get to 
clean those barracks.ﬂ So, I said, 
like, but then I see, there is 
his desk with all the papers 
and the radio is playing. I think if I™m going 
to play smart, I won™t get this job, because, 
you know, I have to be dumb to know how to cl
ean the floors. So, I decided that I™m not 
going to tell him that I know Ger ma n. I don™t 
know why, but at that mo ment, my mi nd 
started working, and I figured to clean the floor
s, you don™t need to be intelligent, just be 
as dumb as you can. So, he says, ﬁCan you–ﬂ I™ll speak English. ﬁCan you speak 
German? ﬂ  So, I said [so-so gesture with 
hand]. And he said to me , ﬁAnd how about - 
what do you speak? ﬂ  So, I said, ﬁPolish.ﬂ Polish he couldn™t speak. So, he says to me , 

ﬁSo what can you do? ﬂ So, I said, ﬁ
Putzen
.ﬂ I mean, he told me  already that I™m going to 
clean. So, that™s what - I didn™t know. I neve r did the - I never cleaned a floor in the 
house, in my house, never touched it. So, then he says to me , ﬁ When you clean, I don™t 
want you to touch anything on my - on my desk 
because this is all pr ivate. I don™t want  - 
if you want to - from ti me to time , I™ll clean 
it, and you will be able to
 clean. All I want is 
to clean around, to clean the floor, but don™t 
touch it, and don™t touch my radio.ﬂ So– 
 
Q: Now, he™s saying this to you in German. 
 
A: InGerman. 
 
Q: In simple German?  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
100 
 
 
A: I pretend that - the way he shows me  around, 
I pretend that I only unde
rstand a little bit. 
So, then he sees that I™m - I always - since 
I walked in, I decided 
that I™ll play dumb. So, 
then he says, he looks at me , he tells me , 
he shows me  how to do this, how to do this, 
okay. Then, he says not to touch those - I 
mean, he was showing me  because he knew 
that I could only speak a little 
- then he says, ﬁCan you read? ﬂ So, I look at him. I pretend 
that I don™t understand and I says [shakes head
]. ﬁAnd write?ﬂ So, I 
says, again a listened. 
I pretend, so he shows me. I said [shakes head]. 
So, he said - I reme mber
 - Krysia will tell 
everybody my ﬁSo gross ker faxen so dumﬂ . 
Do you understand this? She™s ﬁSo gross ker 
faxenﬂ means ﬁShe grew so tall and she™s so
 dumb.ﬂ You know, like that™s what he said. I 
wanted to laugh, but I really, be
lieve me  I was telling myself 
that I was the most clever 
girl. I got the best job. I got
 the cleaning. So, I was readi
ng all his - since I didn™t know 
German well enough. So, he didn™t clean the desk
. He was leaving the papers. I read all 
the papers because, if I was ve
ry careful, I could just prete
nd that I™m cleaning the table 
and read the papers. I listened to the Germ
an broadcast, because the radio was on. I 
couldn™t understand, so he was - he got hims
elf the best cleaner. We  weren™t there too 
long, but during that time– 
 
Q: What did you hear and what did you read?  
 
A: That™s what it is - I read all the orders. I 
knew that  the war is bei
ng lost. I knew - I read 
all those - the letters that he gather ed. 
That™s how we ran away. Renia was cleaning 
another room. I would go back to Krysia - how
 she fed us. She was ma rvelous, but I™ll go 
back to this portion. I™ll just ta
lk now about this situation he
re. So, I read everything and 
then, the Russians were already so close that he
 got orders that on such and such a date to 
let everybody go except the guards, because th
ey weren™t sending the Jews anymore to 
work, because they had to go out of the camp. So
, that - we had the - like, we were Poles, 
but we took off our triangles because then th
e people that work outside had white crosses 
across the back with the paint.
 Like, whatever - if you work
ed outside, you had the white 
cross painted like this right acr
oss the back. So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion 
that she works in the kitchen, she gets some  fl
our and water, and she™ll be able to ma ke 
the crosses, new crosses, on our clot he s, because
 we - we had clothes there. We  were also 
distributed so me clothes for us because it 
was a small camp. It wasn™t a big camp. We 
were all girls. And this, we decided that we 
are going to run away, 
but we had to have a 
strategy. We  had a Jewish girl from Lubli
n. She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she 
spoke perfect German. She was one of us wo
rking in the barracks because there were 
either ten or twelve of us working the ba
rracks. I don™t remember. 
Since she could speak 
so well German, we decided th
at she™s going to steal the 
kapo
™s - you know, 
kapos
 were 
wearing a black cape, a black cape what covere
d whatever - they di
dn™t wear uniforms, 
just a black cape with a hood. So, she stole th
is hood from he r, and then Krysia - we 
decided that what we can do to 
take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just 
crumbled the - like we ha d to wear the crosse
s inside, but in order 
to get outside, to run 
away from camp - I knew exactly because my 
boss didn™t come  to work that day. I don™t 
know whether he came later or  so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
101 
 
or twelve days before the end of the war. 
So, in the morning, we got up this Helena wa s 
her name  - she put on the cape, we ma de sure 
that there was no sign of the cross, and she 
- we came to the gate. She told the post th
at she registers with 
him ten people going to 
work outside, whatever - she knew what to sa
y, where outside, and he says - he showed 
us to go. We  went to the road, and all - fr
om there on, we didn™t have to worry because 
all the Germans were running towards west. They were afraid. The Russians were very 
close, so the Germans were leaving their 
homes and everything ma rching, running away 
from the Russians. They were afraid. So, we were in the group. Nobody noticed us. 

Nobody bothered us, but we didn™t have what to
 eat and we didn™t know
 what to do. But, 
we run away. We ™re out of the camp. As a ma
tter of fact, one girl from Ra dom that I 
suggested that she goes with us, she didn™t 
want  to go because she had - some body gave 

her spreads - some  sardines, a box of sardines. She had it with some one. She didn™t want 
to leave it, or  she didn™t - she didn™t want to
 give it to he r, and she didn™t want - because 
she wanted to eat it, she didn™t want to r
un away. So, they went to another camp from 
there, you know, after - the Russians were - 
they must have gotten orders to go more 
west, but we were already free. So, we - that
 was it. Those were the camps. Now, Krysia - 
she worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending 
to us - she wa s working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand 
under the kitchen and have our me tal thi
ng with the handle. She would push down a 
string. We  would put the string on the handle. 
She roped it, and she would take - because 
there was meat, like horse meat, but we didn™t get it; the Germans - the Germans got it. 
We only got the soup. So, she would take a t
ongue or whatever, you know, she had there 
a big piece - a big piece of meat she would 
send it back. We  would take it and divide 
among all the girls. So, everybody had some thing, not only some thing to eat, but we were 
not used to such - so rich food. It was tremendous. One day she tells me  this story. She 
worked there. She stole a pound 
of butter. It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil, 
and she says she didn™t know what to do with it because, I me an, the Germans was - her 

boss, the German cook, was watching her. So, 
she put it in her pants so that she could 
take the butter to take to us, and when sh
e started working and cleaning up, the butter 
started dripping, and she got so scared she 
almost died. She - but anyway, she ma naged 
somehow to bring the butter - th
e butter to feed us. So, we 
really in Retzow we didn™t 
have a bad da y, because she was supplying a
ll the food. She was stealing it, but she was 
supplying all the food and nobody - a
ll the girls that knew, they 
noticed that I went out to 
get whatever, they were already waiting. 
I mean everybody was hungry. So, that was also 
lucky. We  were lucky there. Bu
t, this is all about Retzow. 
There™s very - we  don™t have 
much to say about it becaus e we weren™t there too long. 
 
Q: Did you feel liberated when you left?  
 
A: Right away. Right away. We
 walked with the Germans. We went that way, but we 
decided to– 
 
Q: One second. I was asking you did you feel liberated when you left?  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0411  
102 
 
A: We did. We  did, but
 we were far away from home
. We didn™t know where we were 
going. We decided to - we deci
ded to stop going west because we were going - by going 
west we™re getting too far away from home , a
nd we - and we - we heard already Russians 
speaking. So, we decided to get off the road, a
nd just ma naged to go back - to walk back, 
but we were afraid because this way 
where we were going we st, nobody could - nobody 
was suspecting us of running away from ca m
p. We™re running away to the west where all 
the Germans, you know, with all their possible 
treasures that they had. They had horse 
and wagons and stuff like that, and they we
re all going west running away from the 
Russians, but then at one point, we decided, 
all ten of us, we had 
one Russian girl, not 
Jewish, with us, too. Most of
 the girls were Jewish. Helena was also Jewish, but she 
didn™t look it. She spoke perfect
 German. She could get away with being German just in 
case if some thing would happen, and we got o
ff t he road and we started going through 
this forest. We started going 
back home . Back home ! We  we
re far away from home, but 
back to the east. 
 
Q: I™ll tell you what. I think that
 we™ve spent a very, very long 
day today, and I think that we 
should just plan at some  point that
 we  continue this. That is enough. 
 
A: That would be great. Thank you. 
 
Q: And I really thank you. 
 
A: I thank you very much. I really thank you fo
r your consideration and for being so delicate 
with me , be cause I was always afraid of this - 
not afraid for, I was always - I felt that my 
body, I me a n, I™m not healthy enough to take 
- to think about Holocaust for so ma ny, you 
know, hours at time s because ™til now I was not successful in not suffering afterwards, 
but really it was so nice of
 you. I feel good, and I™m glad I give you this interview.
