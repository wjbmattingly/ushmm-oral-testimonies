JACK BAUM 
 December 16, 1995 
 
Question: Jack, will you begin by telling me
 your name  and when and where you were 
born?  
Answer: My question is would you like to kno
w the name  now, when I changed the name  
or would you like to know my original
 name from Poland, from Warsaw? 
Q. Why don't  you tell me  both. 

A. My original name  was -- as they called
 me  in Poland, Yackob Svibaum, was it in Poland, 
as they called me .  My Jewish name  in Pola
nd they call me  Yankal Svibaum, Yankal in Jewish. 
I had a very large family in Warsaw. 

Q. But your name  today is? 

A. My name  today -- I changed my na me.  Why 
did I change my name?   Wh en I arrived in 
the United St ates, I arrived in Buffalo, New Yor
k.  My mother-in-law made an agreement with 
her cousin, with furriers, they us
ed to be furriers in Buffalo.  She ma de an agreement they had to 
put down about $5,000 I think and I should work for 
them.  When I arrived in Buffalo, I wanted 
to join the Je wish Community Center to re gist er 
and they asked me  my na
me and I told them my  
name Sviba u m.  "Svibaum, that's a very hard 
name .  Why don't you change your name ? "   I said, 

"Look I was in a lot of places in Europe.  I ha
d no trouble to change my name .  Why s hould I 
change my name ?   Suppose some body wants to l
ook up to me, trying to find me ."  I wouldn't 
change the name .  "Oh, don't worry about it.  They'll find you.  Take away the Svi and leave the 

baum.  So one person tell me  that and another pers
on tell me  that and I did.  That's what I did.  I 
changed my name from Svibaum into Baum
.  That's when I arrived to Buffalo.

Q. That's Jack Baum? 
A. Yes, Jack Baum.  From Yackob came -- you kno
w in the United States they changed the 
name , yes I changed it to Jack Baum.  So, my na
me  now is Jack Baum a nd before my name  was 
Yackob Svibaum.  

Q. What was the date you we re 
born?  What wa
s your birthdate. 
A. 1918, July the 9th. 

Q. Where were you born? 

A. I was born in Wa rsaw.  I was born in Wa rs
aw and I left Wa rsaw in 1943, as I told you 
before. 

Q. Tell me  a little bit about 
your fa mily before the wa r? 
A. Before the war, my fa mily was a beautiful
, nice fa mily and a popular family and people I 
should say with money, not poor.  They used to 
say in Wa rsaw, "If you can afford to buy fish for 
supper to eat fish on Friday night and serve it, m
eans that you are not a poor
 ma n."  We had a lot 
of poor people in Wa rsaw.  Usually on Thursday, 
the poor, the beggars they used to go from 
door to door, from store to store to give them a 
fe w pennies.  That was every Thursday.  In fact 
they used to come  to my father's place on Thur
sday and he was ready for them, you know to give 
everybody some  money.  My fa mily 
was a religious fa mily.  I should say that my fa mi l y was in 

those days an orthodox family, the whole family.  
My father was, I should say if he would come  
to the United States he would be a good canter. 
 He had a good voice.  He used to dom for his 
friend in the shobots and you know on the holiday.  He
 used to help my uncle, which actually 
that was my father's uncle.  We  call him the _______________ in Jewish.   ___________ is an 

uncle.  And he used to dom a lot of holidays a
nd his apartment he had the people and they used 
to come  and my father used to help him out 
and I was a good singer too, which I used to sing in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424

the synagogue in Wa rsaw for the ________________, the 
greatest cantors we ever had in this 
world. 
 And I used to sing with them and I was a good singer.  Some  holidays I had to take off 

and go with my father and my brother too.  We  used 
to help my uncle as a c
hoir.  So, that's what 
happened in that time.  It's a 
fact that one of my s econd cousins I should say, and the fi rst 
cousins, I didn't know that they went to Australia 
in that time before the wa r.  A lot of Jewish 
people before the war went to Australia.  Why?  
 They didn't have to pay anything.  Australia was 
looking for people at that time.  A lot of people we
nt from Wa rsaw.  I didn't  know this but I find 
when I went to Australia to visit my cousi
n, I find a lot of people from Warsaw and that 
synagogue and that Saturday I was invited to be at
 the bar mitzvah.  I didn't  know about this.  I 
wish I would know about it that 
time and I wouldn't have had to 
be in concentration camps and 
the Wa rsaw uprisings and I would go to Australia too. 

 My whole family if you want to know what 
my family did, I should say almost --about 75 
percent of my fa mily was in the 
furniture business, salesmen or in
 the business.  We  had a street 
in Wa rsaw.  The street name  was Bugner.  The 
Bugner Street was a very
 popular street as a 
furniture business street.  If some body needed so
me thing, to buy a piece of furniture or antiques 
or to remodel to restyle furniture, they went tothe Bugner Street.  My fath
er was there, my aunts 
-- I had two aunts.  They were there in the fu
rniture business.  I should say that my fa mily 
occupied ma ybe half the street of 
the furniture business, very popular. 

 Of course my father's name  was ve
ry popular.  In my neighborhood everybody knew 
Shyet Svibaum.  Shyet Svibaum was a very popular 
ma n.  First of all, he wa s a president from 
____________ hasidic not far from t he street wh
ere I lived.  ____________ hasidic means that 
that was an organization that they sent to
 sick people for overni
ght.  They call it _____________, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
4 
 
 
a Russian ___________, you know, to take care of the 
sick people for nothing, no charge, freely.  
My father was president there and he was a ve
ry popular ma n.  Even hi
s friends were very 
popular.  In Warsaw, ma ybe people through Wa r s aw th
ey know this.  In Warsaw, my  father had 
long hair.  He was blonde.  Our fa mily, almost
 everybody was blonde.  Only my brother had dark 
hair.  I don't know why.  My mother was blonde. 
 My father was blonde.  I was blonde and my 
father had a tough time with his hair
.  His hair, it used to stick 
on.  Whenever he put on a Jewish 
hat, a yama kah, or he put on the -- the yama kah wa
s not bad, a hat, a regular hat, it always used 
to stick out, his hair, here in the front.  
So, in Wa rsaw they give him a name .  _______________, 
why they called it _____________, it come s fr
om Polish.  It's  a Polish word.  ___________ 
means if the hair is sticking out here, whatever 
you're doing the hair come
s out.  So, he had a lot 
of friends and his friends every one of his friends
 had such a nick name .  That's how it was in 
Warsaw.  They give everybody -- if it was Levi
n they give him anot
her name , whatever. 
 So, and then we had I should say, when I st
arted to work -- I was 13 years old when I 
started to work.  I started to work as a furrier  for Maximillion at that  time.  His name  was 

Maximillion Applebaum.  When he arrived in the United States the Applebaums, he had a 

different name.  He put up for business a differe
nt name , Maximillion fi rst, which is in New 
York, Fifth Avenue.  I used to work for him for th
ree years to learn the trade and I didn't  get paid 

a penny.  He didn't pay.  First of all, it was hard
 to get into his place. 
 It wa s a strictly union 
place, but I had a cousin and the cousin knew 
Maximillion very well, a woman, and she asked 
me , " Would you like to work for him? "  I said, "Yes, 
let's start to work.  Let's learn a trade."  So, 
when I finished my publ ic school, and I used 
to go evening courses, I take, the name  was 
_________________.  _____________ means "school," 
______________ me ans where they 

teach you business.  I used to take the evening cl
asses.  I finished at that time my public school 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
5 
 
 
and I went to learn this trade.  
I learned for three years there.  
Then finally, I learned some thing, I 
changed the place.  I coul dn't ma ke money there you 
see.  They didn't pay me .  So, I  had to look 
for a job and I started to look for jobs and 
I went from one job into the other and the 

____________ was very good at that time.  It's not like 
as it is now here in the United St ates.  
The _______________ is going down in the United States. S
o, I went from one place to another. 
 I went to a pl ace as an operator  already, a m
achine operator.  There was a fellow, a cutter, 
we call it cutters, people cutting th
e furs, and I wa s an operator on the machine.  The cutter gave 
it to me  operate.  We  had a cutter in that 
shop and our bosses name  was Stigel, that was a 
German Jew.  He was the boss.  He was the owner from that fur business.  He was a very popular 

ma n in a very popular beautiful area.  I should sa
y that Wa rsaw was before the war so beautiful 
that they called Wa rsaw the second Pa ris which 
people don't know about it.  That's  how beautiful 
Warsaw was.  But I want to fi
nish with that fur operating.  

 That fellow who was the cutter, who gave it 
to me to operate the stuff, his name  was 
Daniel Swartzfooter.  That's Daniel Swartzfooter's fa mily was one I should say of the wealthiest 

people in Wa rsaw.  Wha t  they did, they used to
 sell materials for suits, English materials for 
suits, for the me n you know, for the wome n and th
ey were very popular in Wa rsaw.  A big 
fa mily.  They lived a few blocks away from me , 
and that particular Dani
el Swartzfooter before 

the war started, before the Germans occupied
 Poland, that I should say was between 1936 and 
1937, he asked that Stigel, our boss, Mr. Stigel, w
ould you like to go to Australia with me ?   He 
said, "No, Daniel.  I'm a n old ma n 
already."  He said to Mr. Stig
el, "Mr. Stigel, I tell you there's 
going to be a war here and who knows what's  going 
to happen with you."  A
nd Mr. Stigel says to 
him, "Look Daniel, whatever is go
ing to happen, I don't care.  Iwouldn't go to Australia now and 
open a business at my age.  I'm an old ma n alre
ady," he says.  And he says, "Whatever is going 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
6 
 
 
to happen, if I have to die here, I'm going to die.
  That's it."  That Swar tzfooter quit the job.  I 
didn't know about it but after I fi
nd out -- that Swartzfooter was so
 popular in Wa rsaw that I am a 
theater lover and I am a cantor lover myself.  
I love cantors but good ones, popular ones.  My 
daughter knows that.  If I come  here I'm looking fo
r a fa mous  cantor so she takes me  there.  And 
that Swartzfooter had a lot of friends, Jewish 
actors the most popular actors, what we had, and 
it's a fact that Swartzfooter ma rried a Jewish act
ress from War s aw.  She was a dancer.  She was a 
very popular actress.  I forgot her name .  And, he 
after he got ma rried he 
moved to Australia.  I 
didn't know this.  I find out later 
on that he went to Australia. 
 Now, what would you like to know now, about my brother? 
Q. Well, did you havebrothers and sisters? 

A. I had one brother.  We  are two kids, that's 
all.  He  was a furrier too.  He was a different 

kind of furrier.  I should say that
 he was one of the best mechanic
s in Warsaw and the best furrier 
I should say.  Why?   He knew how to ma ke a garm
ent, and he knew how to finish a garment as a 
finisher too.  It means he could ma ke a garm
ent from the beginning to the end, to finish. 
Q. Now, you went to a public school?   You didn't go to a Jewish school? 

A. Yes, I went to a Jewish school before, toa Hebrew school.  The fact
 that my teacher was 
one of the best teachers Poland had.  The owne
r from the Jewish school, from the Hebrew 
school, lived in my apartment building where I lived.  My apartment building was a very popular 

apartment building.  They called it _________ 
Street.  In Polish it's _______________ number 
24, and this was a very popular 
building.  That's  why we had w
ealthy people living in this 
building, very popular ones.  We  had a lot of busin
ess people from the street
 which they lived in 
this building.  The owner from the Hebrew 
school lived in this building.  His name  was 
_____________ Clapper they call it in Jewis
h.  It was a popular Hebrew school. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424

 We had _______________ rabbi, a very popular rabbi 
lived in my apartment building.  
It's a fact that we had like -- that
 ma n they call it ______________.  _____________ was a very 
strong, popular -- one of the stronge
st people of Europe.  He used 
to appear in different cities, 
ma ybe overseas and he used to ma ke from steel, 
from iron, he used to ma ke different kinds of 
flowers in his hands and all the ki
nd of things, he was very, very st
rong.  Every Friday he used to 
come  to that _____________ rabbi, to my building, ev
ery Friday and he used to ask that 
______________ rabbi that he should pray for him th
at nothing should happen to him.  If he 
appears to make the flowers or you know, he used 
to hit with nails.  Diffe
rent kinds of things, 
very strong, very popular.  That's  wha t  he used to
 do.  Every Friday night he came  with an open 
car, a beautiful open car with a le
ather jacket and a leather hat. 
 He was a very, very popular 
ma n.  He had a brother, but the brother wasn't  as
 strong as he was and liv
ing in a different city. 
Q. Let me  ask you, you lived in a Jewish neighborhood? 

A. Yes, our neighborhood was strictly, strictly, a 
Jewish neighborhood.  It's  a fact that on a 
Saturday every store was closed.  You couldn't 
have an open store.  You couldn't see an open 

store on our street.  You could 
see just walking very religious
 people with long coats, the 
____________ and with the Jewish hair and the black 
hats, to the synagogues, walking a lot of 
people.  Strictly the sabbath and every store wa
s closed in our neighborh
ood.  It's a fact on my 
street, I lived farther _____________ 24, _____________ 6 was a very famous 

_______________.  The ___________ synagogue has a lot of history.  That's  why the 

_____________ synagogue is the only synagogue left fr
om Warsaw.  The only synagogue which 

the Germans I guess didn't  have the chance, didn'
t have the time  to do some thing with that 
synagogue to destroy that synagogue.
  That's why the Russians, they were after them when the 
Russians started to occupy Poland they 
used to fly.  They had to leave. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424

 This synagogue first of all, what I wanted 
to tell you about late
r on ma ybe about cantors, 
which I used to sing.  When I sang in that ______________ in the choir, it was one of the best 
choirs we had and ______________, the very, very fa mous cantor, very famous, the most 

popular I should say in Europe 
at that time  was ________________.  And _________________ 
as I reme mb er that _____________ has the last serv
ice before the Germans closed up that 
synagogue.  They closed it up for a reason which I 
find out.  The reason was they made from that 
synagogue a warehouse.  The warehouse was, the 
Germans took away, they went from door to 
door with the Ukrainians.  The Ukrainians they us
ed to help them out.  They went from door to 
door from a partment to apartment, they cleaned 
out furniture.  They took away diamonds from 

the people, everything, clothing, and they put in 
that particular synagogue
.  That's  what the 
Germans us ed for a warehouse.  It's a fact that
 before the Germans left, they used to ma ke 
auction sales in that particular synagogue to se
ll this stuff to the poor, the Polish people, and the 
rest they give it to the army fo
r nothing, whatever was left over.  
After that, as I heard that they 
left Wa rsaw, the Germans, they had to go -- as 
I told you before, the Russians, they were after 
them.  That's why that particular synagogue is st
ill there, but in very bad shape.  They didn't 
bomb that synagogue.  They didn't destroy that 
synagogue, but the Polish people didn't  take care 

of it and we didn't have Jewish people ther
e anymore there so nobody -- they didn't have a 
chance to take care.  I find sw
astikas on the walls when I visited three years ago Poland. 
Q. Let me  ask you, you lived in a Jewish neighborhood, did you have any contact with 

Christian Polish people? 

A. The contact with the Polish people I had 
-- what happened in Warsaw.  The Germans 
they put signs on the street all ove
r.  IT's a fact that in 1940 the 
Germans they start to build the 
fences. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
9 
 
 
Q. I'm talking about before the war? 
A. Oh, before the war?   Before the war I actua
lly didn't  have contact with the Polish people, 
only in the pl ace where I worked, they used to come  in as customers and I used to talk with them 

a little bit. Otherwise I had one 
friend, a Polish friend, we used to work together in the shop and 
he was a good singer.  He used to sing songs, this a nd that, and I used to like him.  That's  why he 

was a very close friend to me .  And I had anot
her close friend, which he lived in the same  
building where the _____________. He used to live there.
  We used to play 
soccer together and 
he was a very close Poli
sh friend to me  too. 
Q. Now, before  the war, did -- 

A. This was before the war. 

Q. Were you aware of much anti-semitism?  

A. Yes, Poland had always anti-semitism, as long as I know.  And I know from all those 

years but it wasn't  that bad.  They didn't kill peop
le just  --  you could hear them speaking against 
Jewish, against synagogues, agains
t cantors and they were jealous 
of the Jewish people.  That's  
why the Jewish people were big business people. 
 They had the biggest businesses in Warsaw.  
They had theaters, all theaters belonged to Jewish 
people.  Movies, they used to belong to Jewish 
people.  It's a fact that mine grandpa was in the 
furniture business too.  He  used to fix the chairs 
for the movi e theaters.  When he finished the chai
rs, he used to take me  with him and deliver the 
chairs to those movie theaters.  The movie theater
s were on a street, the mo
st beautiful street in 
Warsaw.  The name  wa s ______________.  _______________ was a very famous s t reet in 

Warsaw which we had the most movi e theaters up
 there and they used to belong to the Jewish 
people.  And the Polish people were very, 
very jealous.  They'd buy nightclubs, popular 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
10 
 
 
restaurants, nightclubs, ev
erything was in the Jewish hands, I 
should say, ninety percent was in 
the Jewish hands. 
Q. Did you ever experience personally rema rks 
or any anti-semitic attacks be fore the war? 
A. Not attacks.  I didn't see a
ttacks during the war, not attacks.
  But a fact is say my bunker, 
they call it the bunker, when I was in the unde
rground, before I went to the underground, how do 
I organize?   I organi
ze a few furriers -- 
Q. We should get to that
 later, if you don't mi nd. 
A. I used to belong with _______________, the fell
ow who actually organized the uprising 
in Wa rsaw.  I should say he was actually from th
e beginning that organized the uprising.  I was 
with him in the same  organization.  The organization's na me  was ____________________.   

Q. We 'r e talking before the war? 

A. Before the war.  He was a young boy and I wa
s a young ma n at that time and then I used 
to belong in _________________, another organiza
tion.  I used to belong to ________________, 
which I was a soccer player at that time  
and ______________ they called me  Bealus.  Why did 
they call me  Bealus?   Bealus is 
a Polish word.  I was blonde, so th
ey called me  in the team, they 
called me Bealus. 

 What I used to do in that time, I us
ed to help, I was in the __________________.  That's  
an organization that's  still in Israel.  What
 I used to do in that ________________ I used to pack, 
I used to ma il boxes, ma il from Poland into Israel. 
 I was one of the packers with another fellow, 
which he taught me  how to do it and he was a 
Hebrew talker, speaker, 
but we would talk in 
Jewish.  So, I used to belong to those organiza
tions and I used to play in Soccer against the 
Israeli _____________, that one time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
11 
 
 
 So, those are the organizations that I belonge
d.  But before I used to belong, with another 
friend, he's  in New York now, we organi
zed a soccer team, which the name was 
________________, a Hebrew name .  What kind of balls I 
had?   I used to ma
ke balls from my 
father's  stockings, socks.  I used to roll them up 
and ma ke ba lls.  That's  how we started to learn 
how to play soccer. 

 Then we started to play w
ith different kinds of teams. 
Q. Tell me , how much did you know about Hitler
 and what was going on in Germany be fore 
the Germans occupied Poland? 

A. I didn't know a lot about it.  I 
didn't hear a lot about it.  I just
 hear before when they start 
to occupy Europe, when they started in Austria 
and in Czechoslovakia and in Europe and other 

countries, then they came to Poland.  Then they 
occupied Poland.  They started earlier with the 

other countries, with the other 
European countries in the world.  Then they came  probably -- I 
think ma ybe Poland was the third country when they occupied. 
Q. But you didn't  know too much about what they were doing? 
A. I didn't know. 

Q. You didn't have refugees comi ng to Warsaw? 

A. No, I didn't hear a thing about
 it too much.  Wha t  they did, 
what we start to hear then 
what they did with Jewish people.  They send th
em to concentration camps.  They kill them.  
Different kinds of things.  They took away their fa milies, they separated fa milies, that's what I 

heard. 

Q. When did you hear that -- you mean later? 

A. I heard this, yes, before they started to
 occupy Poland I heard already what they'r e doing. 

Q. Do you remember the day that the Nazis occupied Poland? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
12 
 
 
A. If I reme mb er?   Yes, they occ
upied in 1939.  They occupied Poland. 
Q. Whathappened? 
A. In 1939 they start to ma ke trouble.  They
 jumped down from t r ucks and they call it 
______________, in Polish.  They drop people from the street and they put them on the trucks 

and they took them away.  Then we found out at 
Treblinka that they took them to Treblinka and 
they started to take them to diffe
rent kinds of concentration camps. 
 Then they start to build more 
and more concentration camps.   

 Actually the concentration camps, what they
 did, they ma de the concentration camps 
from ca mps, from different kinds of army ca mp
s, they made the concentration camps for the 
Jewish people. 

Q. Let's go back a little bit.  They didn't take
 people to the camps right away did they, in 
1939? 

A. They started to take people fr om the street s.
  They ma de trouble for people.  They closed 
up business. 
Q. Imme diately? 

A. Imme diately. 

Q. Did the troops actually come  ma rching into Wa rsaw? 

A. Thetroops? 

Q. Yes. 

A. Yes. 

Q. Where were you, what were you doing? 

A. What I was doing? 

Q. At the time ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
13 
 
 
A. At that time I was working on the job.  
So, what happened, I figured out the Germans 
were looking for furriers and tailor
s.  It's  a fact that they open
ed a shop on the street where I 
lived, and I start -- that wasn't  in
 the beginning.  In the beginning 
what was actually little by little 
they started -- they close dup businesses.  They di
dn't let the Jewish people be in the businesses.  
They closed up the stores.  They took away me rc
handise.  They emptied the stores.  They took 
away -- they find out where the lawyers are, where 
the doctors are.  They are the first ones that 
they liquidate.  The first ones, docto
rs, lawyers, rabbis, stuff like th
at .  They start to kill so that 
we shouldn't have some  people to give us help, 
to tell us what to do, advisors, professors, 
directors, teachers.  They were the first ones 
that  they were looking for to liquidate them. 
 Then in 1940 they started to build the walls. 
Q. Okay, let me stop you here for a mo me nt.  
I was  trying have you describe to me  what 
actually was happening in the streets when the Ge
rmans ca me in.  What you were doing, where 
you went, what was going on.  Do you reme mber that? 
A. Yes.  That time  I 'll tell you what happened. 
 Right away they took 
people from the street. 
This was the first thing and they started to l
ook up for important people.  Rabbis, teachers, 
professors and stuff like that.  They we
re the first ones that they took away. 
Q. Imme diately. 
A. Imme diately we didn't know what happened w
ith them, what they did with them, whe r e 
did they go with them. 

Q. Did they come  in with tanks?   We re there any bombs? 

A. I actually -- some of them 
ca me  with tanks, some of them, not too ma ny tanks.  The tanks 
they left on the outside of Wa rsaw, like in
 ______________, an area where they left the tanks.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
14 
 
 
We didn't see a lot of tanks.  We  did see a lot of
 trucks comi ng with soldiers.  They jumped from 
the things.  They grabbed 
the people, stuff like this. 
Q. Now, did you run home?   Did you hide some whe r e?   What did you do? 
A. Yes, I tell you what happened.  Whe n I was 
in the apartment, my apartment, usually what 
they did, the Germans, t hey had a lot of Ukrain
ians helping them.  The Germans didn't go to the 
apartments.  The Ukranes came to the apartments
 looking for people and take them out.  They 
took away stuff, but first looking for the people to ta
ke them out.  What I did, I told my  mother --
- she said go to a closet and sh
e would cover herself up with the coats, with whatever and to be 
quiet.  I left.  I told her what's
 going to happen that the Ukrainians
 are going from home to home, 
from apartment to apartment, and they'r e taking 
out people.  What they do with them I don't 
know, I said to her.  So, you stay here and c
over yourselves and be quiet and you'll see what's 
going to happen.  I went to work. 

 Then, when I came back, she told me  that pe
ople like the Ukrainians, they came and they 
knocked at the door, they opened the door and they 
started to look for people.  I was quiet and 
they were sitting around the tables and looking at 
the ovens and the top of the ovens, inside the 
ovens and like the chimneys and they were looking 
for people.  They couldn't find me , she says.  
I heard when they were sitting around the table 
and they would step out already.  They were 
thinking maybe somebody will show and come 
on out, you know, from the hidi ng places, but she 
knew this was a trick, that they were still sitting 
at the tables.  Then, they left.  Then she came 
out from the  closet.  That's what she told me . 

 My father, this was in 1941, I was waiting for my father to come  into the apartment.  He 

didn't show up.  So, I didn't know what happened with
 him, but a friend of his, he lived not far 
from me, was at that time on the 
street and he told me  that a truck with Ge rmans, they jumped 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
15 
 
 
from the truck.  The truck was on the street, a
nd a few Ger ma ns jumped down and they grabbed 
my father and they put him on the truck.  Since th
en, I didn't know what happened to my father.  
He disappeared.  So, that's  what happened.  My 
mother was at  that tim
e still alive.  What 
happened with my mother, I was walking on the st
reet.  This was in 1942.  I was walking on the 
street with my mother and hol
ding my mother on the arm, and walking with her and a German 
soldier, whatever he  was a captain, a sergeant, 
jumped from a  truck and came  over to me  and 
took my mother away from me .  I started to cr
y.  When I started to cry, that German officer 
whatever he was, says to me , "Look if you'll cry 
we'r e going to take you too."  And he took away 
my mother but I should say that was about three 
blocks away from me, and they put her in a 
group which there were more people in her age.  
Then I heard that ma ybe an hour later I heard a 
machine gun was shooting and this is where they
 killed the whole group, and my mother was 
there too.  This was about three blocks away from
 me .  The street was M
iller.  The name  of the 
street was Miller.  And on that 
Miller Street, th
e uprising started. 
Q. So, you were -- 
A. This is what happened with my mother 
and what happened with my father I told you 
before. 

Q. Now, you were describing that after Warsaw
 was occupied, little 
by little the Germans 
were taking away your rights and they had help
 from the Ukrainians.  What about the Polish 
people?   Did they have help from them as well? 

A. The Polish people? 

Q. What were they doing? 

A.  What happened to the Polish people?   They
 didn't  do anything.  They didn't  anything 
absolutely.  If they found out they we re Polish -- 
first of all, they separated the Jewish people.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
16 
 
 
That time they ma de the ghetto, they put fence, 
walls from concrete, some times from bricks and 
they started to close up the ghetto. 
Q. When was this? 

A. This was -- they built the ghettos already in
 1940 and 1941 they started 
to build the walls.  
I moved from one street -- I had to move to th
e other street to live in a different apartment 
building.  Then little by little they stopped everyt
hing.  The Jewish people, they took away their 
rights.  They took away the businesses.  You coul
dn't work, especially when I was a furrier, I had 

some  conne ctions with the Polish side, with the 
other side.  I ma de conne
ctions and the Jewish 
women they couldn't wear fur coats any more.  Th
ey give a spot, there was a certain spot in 
Warsaw which they had to deliver all of the fur 
coats, all of the Jewish people.  The Jewish 
people had to deliver the fur coat
s otherwise they could take them
 to the concentration camps or 
they could kill them if they didn't -- you know what
 I mean.  There was a certain date and we had 

lines with people staying there with
 their fur coat s in thei r hands to
 give away the fur coats.   
 What I did in that time I took a chance.  I 
put on the attic in my apartment on the left 
floor there was an attic, I put up a shop there 
with my brother.  I put up a shop and I took a 
chance at that time.  They could kill me for it if
 they would find out.  If they would find a piece 
of fur there and find out I have a shop they w
ould take me  away, but I took a chance with my 
brother.  We  used to ma ke remodels, to remodel for the furriers which they were on the other 

side fence, on the other side walls, and I ma de a 
lot of money at that time
.  I took a chance, if I 
ma de a fox for some body or whatever, I put it on
 my stomac h around, undern
eath and that's  how 
I smuggled the stuff on the other side.  I took a 
chance, I took off my Jewish star from the 
armbands and I looked like a Gentile.  I didn't 
look like a -- I was blonde 
with a little nose like 
this.  Now I have a long nose already. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
17 
 
 
 So, I took a chance and the guard he looked at 
me  and looked at me  but he didn't stop me .  
I took a chance and I give the fox 
there to the Polish pe
ople.  That was the Polish furriers I was 
dealing with.  He gave me the money and at that
 time  I had a lot of money.  I just didn't know.  
We couldn't get so much for the mone y.  Food was the most important thing at that time.  A lot 
of people started to die from hunger.  That's 
why they didn't have enough food.  We  c ouldn't buy 
-- they closed up all the stores.  We  had to smuggle
.  We  had to get the food from the other side 
to get connections with Polish people and they 
give us the flour, bread, 
whatever, from the other 
side, and I had to give them the money.  First I 
had to give him the mone y and then he give me  
the sugar, flour, whatever we needed.  I had a lot of
 food at that time .  I had plenty.  What I did, I 
used to help my fa mily, wherever I had to my fa
mily.  I used to help them out.  From the table 
where I used to nail the furs, I made a dining ro
om table and I invite a
ll, wherever I could find 
my fa mily people, and we  used to cook and eat a
nd give them to eat, at that time .  I wasn't  
hungry.  I had plenty. 
Q. Now, let me  ask you, was it easy to get in and out of the ghetto? 
A. Yes.  That's  what I did.  I took chances and 
I went out from the ghetto to the other side.  
To the Irish side I call it. 

Q. How did you get in and out? 

A. I was walking.  I took off the star and the 
guards, they knew my face already, and I took a 
chance. 

Q. Where did they think you were going? 

A. He didn't ask me  questions, nothing.  He di
dn't ask me .  I had connections already with 

the other side with the people.  I told them, "L
ook I'm going to ten o'cloc
k here at this spot.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
18 
 
 
Eleven o'clock wherever."  And the people were
 waiting for me  and I gave them the stuff and 
they gave me  the money. 
Q. So, you just walked out the gate? 

A. I just walked out. 

Q. Tell me a little bit about the life in the ghetto? 

A. The life in the ghetto was very tough.  It wa
s mi serable, very tough.  I for instance, I had 
money and I organize myself with food and I wa
s all right.  I could help my fa milies, my 
relatives to give them food and give them to 
eat.  I was all right.  Look, I complained, it was 
tough.  I could see what's  going on.  It was get
ting worse and worse and worse.  People were 
dying on the street from hunger.  They couldn't ge
t food and you could see on the street laying -- 

almost on every street you could see some  pe
ople laying dead from hunge
r and they looked like 
skeletons.  So, that's  what happened.  It started 
to get worse and worse and worse.  They started 
to close up more and more and more -- the German
s they started to move the walls, closer and 
closer and closer.  People from s mall towns from
 Poland, they would think that they were going 
to save their lives in Wa rsaw th
at's  why it's a big city, so they
 came over to live in Warsaw and 
to save themselves.  This was a trick fr om the 
Germans.  That they throw them out from the 

small towns from the small that th
ey should go to Wa rsaw, that they
 have them all in one place.  
They should be able to finish them up. 

 It was very bad.  After that, on my s t reet 
where I lived, I had to move to another.  I 
moved three times.  I had to move that's why they
 closed up the ghetto, clos
er and closer, to have 
the people as I told you in one place.  I started to 
work for the Germans.  They needed tailors and 
furriers.  I was one of the first ones with my brot
her to go there.  That's why I lived on the same  
street, I moved, where they put up the shops, the Ge
rmans for tailors and furriers.  I worked there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
19 
 
 
with my brother.  They give us to eat, you know, m
eals.  So, we had enough to eat.  I wasn't  such 
afraid as the other ones.  That's  why I was work
ing for them.  We made 
fur gloves and fur vests 
before they started to go over to
 the Russians.  So, they prepared themselves.  Russia was cold.  
They needed it for the army, gloves and vests.  That's what we did. 
 Then they closed up the shop.  They clos
ed up the shop and we 
didn't work there any 
more. 

Q. When was that? 

A. We found out some thing was going to happen 
here.  The people they start to build 
bunkers underground.  This was before the uprisings.   

Q. I want to ask you a few more questions about 
ghetto life before we 
get there.  The people 
who couldn't get food, were there soup kitchens, wa
s there any way to try to
 help people?   We re 
there orphanages?   What was going on?   Did th
ey set up different orga
ni zations within the 
ghetto? 
A. There was only one organization, they called it the ______________.  That was on 
______________ Street.  We  had like a Jewish communit
y, like a community center.  They were 
trying to help the Jewish peopl
e there, but the Germans didn't let them do it.  Then, what 
happened, they closed up this place alt
ogether.  This place they kept only _________________, 
if they gave orders to the Jewish people in Wa
rsaw, you have to give away your fur coats, or you 
have to do this or you have to do that, it was only 
in that particular spot 
and that had to go there 
and you know give the fur coats away.  Wherever th
ey told us to do it, th
at was the spot, like a 
Jewish community center. 

Q. Were there efforts to help people ma ybe that
 were illegal, that were ma ybe underground? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
20 
 
 
A. The underground we start to build after it 
started to get very bad.  We  could find out 
what's  going to happen.  They start to look up for 
the Jewish people.  They want to try to find 
them and take them to the concentration camps.  At
 that time we started to build --  and that was 
1943 already. 

Q. Actually, I have a few more questions 
before we get to 1943.  Now I guess I read 
some where that in the Warsaw ghetto that 
there we re you know ma ybe underground schools for 
the children.  That there were sy
mphonies, there were concerts --? 
A. They liquidated everything.  They didn't give
 a chance to the Jewish people to organize 
themselves and to do something.  Th
ey started to close up everything. 
Q. So, none of this was happening in the hiding? 

A. The hiding was tough.  In the hiding we ha
d to organize for food.  We  organize for food 
let's say for one year food.  Our bunker had fo
r one year food.  We  bought it from the Polish 
people.  The Polish people, they actua lly were
 the builders for the underground.  They built it, 
bricklayers, and we had to pay them a high pri
ce for that.  And then what happened on the end, 
they showed the German people where the Je
wish people are laying, where they have the 
underground.  That's  wha t  happened in the end. 

Q. Tell me a little bit about the organi zation w
ithin the Wa rsaw Ghetto ther e was a Judenr ot, 
yes?  

A. Yes.   

Q. Who were they?   What did they do? 

A. The Judenrot they tried to do some thing fo
r the people but the Germans didn't give them 
a chance.  They took away the people that repres
ent the Judenrot.  They took them a way.  They 
didn't give them a chance to organize nothing.  
The Judenrot wasn't  worth a dime .  Nothing.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
21 
 
 
They couldn't  accomplish a thing.  The Germans they ma de it comfortable for themselves to 
ma ke the Judenrot, wherever they give orders to
 the Jewish people of Wa rsaw, we should deliver 
everythi ng there to that particular place.  Then
 what happened they took them a way and killed 
them and put them in a concentration camp, the whole Judenrot.  It was nothing. 

Q. Was there a time when the Judenrot had any power or no? 

A. No.  They didn't give them a chance.  
I tell you why.  For the people they should think 

wherever they needed it, they give them, do it 
this, put signs, do this.  That's why it was the 
Judenrot.  It wasn't  worth a thing. 

Q. So, it wasn't  a ma tter of the Judenrot bei
ng good or bad people, they didn't even have a 

choice, is that what you're saying? 

A. They didn't give them a chance.  It was as
 I told you, if you have to go to the Jewish 
Community Center and go there to 
take care of your stuff that's  wh
at they did.  They called them 
the ______________, actually.  That was 
in one spot, one street. 
Q. What about this __________________? 

A. The _________________, are you talking about the Jewish _______________ or the 

Polish ________________? 

Q. Jewish. 

A. I didn't hear about that.

Q. So,  you're telling me  about the ghetto? 

A. About the children, they just took away fa milies.  The fa milies, you have  the children 

with them, but what happened in the concentration camps, they took away the children from the 

parents.  They separated them and then put them in Treblinka.  They put them in the ovens.  

They didn't need children.  They didn't  want the children.  They had no use, the Germans, for the 

children.  They were nothing.  Young people they 
took to work.  They picked the young people, 
the strong people to work and the older people, they finish them up.  The y put them into the 

ovens and to Birkenau. 

Q. Let's stay in the Wa rsaw ghetto a little b
it longer.  Were the conditions getting worse and 
worse?   We r e  they taking people out regularly?  
 Were they burning things down?   What was 

happening? 
A. That's  what they did.  They used to take 
people from the streets, a
nd they used to take 
them out from the apartments, from the buildings 
at the same time.  But this was a job which the 
Germans left it for the Ukranes.  To show the wo
rld ma ybe that the Germans, they don't do that.  
That that Ukrainians do that, they worked together
.  This was actually a job for the Ukrainians to 
go from house to house, from apartment to apar
tment and take out the people and put them on 
the trucks. 

Q. Was there any religious life left
 in the ghetto even underground? 
A. In the underground? 

Q. In the ghetto at al
l during this period? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
23 
 
 
A. In the ghetto as I told you 
what they did, they destroyed 
all Jewish synagogues which the 
only synagogue as I told you was the ___________, whic
h is still left.  They left the only 
synagogue.  We had very popular synagogues with the 
greatest cantors like the -- they call it the 
__________, they call it in Jewish, the _______________.  So, then there was a Temp le Sinai 
next to the Macabe on the same  street, but
 the organization where  the _____________ I told 
you, the same  neighborhood there wa s a Temple Si
nai.  They destroyed all those synagogues. 
Q. This was during the ghetto period? 

A. This was the ghetto period, that's  right. 

Q. Now, did you practice the reli
gion at all while you were liv
ing in the ghetto?   Did you 
observe the sabbath? 

A. No, we had no more synagogues. 

Q. But in your home s? 

A. In my house , oh yes, I could do it for myse
lf, yes.  If people there religion is enough, you 
know what I mean.  To do it, they didn't  care so
 I could do my  service in my apartme nt, yes. 
Q. Didyou? 

A. Yes, why not. 

Q. Whataboutholidays? 

A. Holidays, you couldn't go out anymore for holid
ays, and to do actually the holidays.  You 
didn't have synagogues anymore.  They liquidated 
them.  Privately, only I could ma ke a service 
in the underground, the short time  that we have, 
that's  all.  Otherwise we had no chance, but 
people they stopped to be religious 
at that time.  They'r e afraid for the death, that they'r e going to 
get them.  That they'r e going to take them out. 
 They stopped doing it.  The very religious people, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
24 
 
 
very, they would ma ybe do for thems e lves and pr
ay to God that nothing should happen to them, 
but you know. 
Q. What was the general mood in the ghetto? 

A. The general mood in the ghetto was very, very
 bad.  We  could see that it's  getting worse 
and worse from day to day.  Less food, more d
eaths you could see.  More dead people on the 
streets laying around.  They took them away.  Th
ey ma de Jewish police, the Germans.  They 
ma de Jewis h, the guards, and everything Jewish.  That's  what they did. 

Q. Were the Jewish police 
good to the community or not? 
A. They were good to the community but they 
were trying actually to work for the Germans, 

you know what I mean?   To get close with the Ge
rmans, they were thinking ma ybe they'r e going 
to save their lives with that.  But it didn't happe
n.  They took away the Jewish police.  They shoot 

them.  They kill them.  They took them to th
e concentration camps.  In the end, there was 
nothing.  I wa s in a concentration camp.  I had two Jewish people for kapos, the guy, like a 
ma nager who took care of my block, were Jewish 
people from Warsaw.  They used to kill the 
Jewish people in the concentra
tion camp.  You c ouldn't do this. 
 You couldn't do that, otherwise 
they killed them.  Jewis h people killed the Jewi
sh people.  We had a policeman, a very fa mous 
policeman in Wa rsaw, very famous.  He was very fa
mous, a fighter, a boxer.  He used to help the 
Germans, to save himself, to save his life.
  It didn't  help, th
ey took him away too. 
Q. So, you were starting to tell me  that 
towards 1943 you knew the situation was very bad 
and with some  other people you decided to go underground; is that right? 
A. Yes.  I took a few furriers with me , which 
I knew the furriers, and 
I give some money, 
everybody gi ve some  mo ney to the Polish builders, to
 the br icklayers, and they actually built our 
bunker in the underground.  We  had to pay a high pr
ice for it.  But what happened in the end?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
25 
 
 
They told the Germans where the people were
 living, where their bunkers are, where the 
undergrounds are.  They came, it was impossibl
e, -- my opening, where it was on the sidewalk, 
was impossible to find an opening to our bunker.  
Impossible.  You couldn't see a thing, but the 
Germans came right away to the spot and they opened.  They knocked and we had to open.  Then 

they used to hold the hand grenades, ready to th
row in the hand grenades.  Come  on out or you'll 
die, and we had to come  out.  That's what the 
Pollacks, they di d.  They helped the Germans. 
Q. Tell me a little bit a
bout this underground 
activity.  Who was  involved, how ma ny 
people, what you did? 

A. How ma ny people, I had about 12 people in 
my underground, furriers.  I was there, my 
brother was there with me.  My br
other was still with me  at that time .  A mother I didn't  have, a 
father I didn't  have, and what happened with 
the rest, I didn't know.  One didn't know from the 
other what happened.  Everybody started to 
get selfish.  Everybody was trying to help 

themselves. 
 We organized food.  Wh at happe
ned.   We  used to pull numbers every time.  I had to go 
say tonight.  Another one had to go the next 
one and to pick up the food from the Pollocks, 
which we were dealing with them.  If you give th
em money, they give us the food.  That's what 
we had to do, to take chances.  Whe n we left
, we opened the door and to go out, the Germans 
could find us and kill us too.  
So, we took chances on that.  That's  why we had to change, we 
pulled numbers.  You have to go tonight, you have to go tomorrow.  That's  what we did. 
Q. Was there any leadership to this underground moveme nt? 

A. The leadership what we had -- actually 
we didn't have leaders I should say.  Everybody 
was a leader for himself.  Every bunker was a lead
er and we had to take
 chances and organize 
ourselves.  We had some weapons
 which we organized.  What wasn't  enough, it was like a play, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
26 
 
 
like a game .  There wasn't  enough weapons.  We  
couldn't get so much.  We had the money, but 
we couldn't organize too much.  Most of them we
 organize from the Polish soldiers, which they 
used to steal and bring over to ma ke the money. 
 You couldn't fight a German ar my.  You had 
to give up.  It wasn't  enough.  There was a 
street next to my street, ____________.  The 
street's  na me  was _____________.  So, what we 
did, we went up on the third floor
 there with hand grenades a
nd we opened the windows.  We  
saw the Germans passing by.  The Germans were pa
ssing by on motorcycles or in the car.  We  

used to throw the hand grenades an
d some  of them we used to kill. We  had to run down fast, as 
fast as possible, to go 
back into the bunker. 
 What happened ma ybe a  half hour later, Germans came to this building with bombs.  

They destroyed it.  The whole bu
ilding went down a half an hour la
ter.  That's  what happened.   
 We couldn't accomplish a lot.  IF some body will tell you this, it was nothi ng.  It was 

nothing.  In the end what happened, the Pollocks, th
ey told them wh
ere the Jewish are.  They'r e 
laying here, that's why they built those bunkers.  
They knew the spots.  We had to come  out.  
They went to every place.  They knew exactly where every pl ace was and we had to come  out 

otherwise they killed the fa mily.  Wh y do 
I want to tell you this, it's a fact -- 
Q. Tell me  a little bit about 
your bunker and what your plans were and when you went into 
hiding?  

A. When I went into hi ding?  I went into hiding it was in the begi nning of '43.  We built that 

bunker and since then we had to go into hiding.  
We had to do it.  We  organized ourselves, 
wherever we  could.  We  had plenty of money, 
but we didn't know we couldn't use the money.  
We couldn't buy so much food.  We  c ouldn't buy a
nything.  We had just the money and that was 
it.  We  were laying underneath and everyday the sa
me  routine, the same  thing.  There was no end

to the war.  We expected the war to be finish
ed but we couldn't see the end of it.  Then the 
Germans di d find us as I told you. 
Q. Tell me a little bit more about the bunker.
  Who was in there w
ith you?   Were there 
wome n?   Did you have weapons? 

A. The wome n, yes, they we re there.  They 
used to cook dinners and everything there.  It 
was hard.  It wasn't  easy.  To use the toilet, you 
know, it was very hard.  We had to wait long.  It 
was tough, it was very tough.  We  knew that we had 
to do it.  Otherwise we'd be dea d.  This was 
the only solution.  The only thing to do it, but th
at didn't help either.  You had to come  out. 
Q. So, in other words, you actually had a -- wh
at did it look like?  Ho
w much did you really 
have underground? 

A. We  had plenty of room.  We  had where to sl eep, we had a toilet.  The Pollocks, they built 

pretty good.  We  paid a lot of money for it.  In f
our years, we had money a t  that time.  That's 
why our trade was very good.  We  got money.  
We were pretty good organi
zers, and we had the 
money.  Wh at the others did I don't know.  In some
 areas you had very poor areas.   What they 
did and how they organized themselves, I don't know.  It was very tough. 

Q. So, you were all independent? 

A. Yes. 

Q. What was your plan? 

A. As I told you, a time came that you couldn't even save your own fa mily.  The selfishness 

from the people.  Everybody was trying to sa
ve themselves.  That's  what happened. 
Q. What was you plan when you went into hiding? 

A. My plans?   Nothing.  My plan was as long as I 
am able to be there, I will be there.  That's  

it.  I know.  I had a feeling that some thing is goin
g to happen.  It's  not going to be forever, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
28 
 
 
that's what happened.  I didn't trust the Polish 
people.  I said to my
 friends that you know 
some thing I'm afraid ma ybe the Pollocks th
ey will tell the Germans wher e we are. 
Q. But was your original plan to 
try to wait out the war underground? 
A. Yes.  We  had the food.  We organized the food and what we had to do.  I was sure they 
wouldn't find us.   I used to go out.  I had to 
look for myself to see th
e entrance into the bunker 
was right on the sidewalk ma de.  The same  color,
 the same  -- you couldn't see a thing, but they 
find us.  That's what we figured.  The Pollo
cks they told the Germans where we are. 

Q. Did you have weapons in the bunker? 

A. Yes, most hand grenades we had.  The hand gr
enades were very easy 
to -- we got it from 
the Pollocks, from soldiers, which 
they were stealing.  They were 
stealing.  They wanted to ma ke 
money.  They got good pay for it.  So, we had 
the hand grenades.  That's  what we had. 
Q. What did you do with them?  

A. Nothing.  They were left  there in the bunker when we had to go.  What happened to 
everything.  We had gold there layi
ng.  We  had a lot of things la
ying there.  We  had to go.  We  
had a chance.  We  hardly had time to put
 shirt and pants, you know, to come  out. 
Q. You were telling me , and I don't think we r
ecorded this yet, you 
were telling me  that 
there was a time  when you were
 actually leaving the bunker and 
trying to drop these little hand 
grenades on German sol diers? 
A. I think what we did was with
 the building only, as I told you. 

Q. Tell me  again because I'm not sure we recorded that. 

A. We went to the building that was next to 
us and we  went up to the third floor.  We  
opened the windows.  We figured we'r e going to 
stay there and wait until the Germans who pass 

by, and they'll pass by on motorcycles and we th
row some  hand grenades and we kill so me  of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
29 
 
 
them.  Then we start to run down fas t , you know, we
 are afraid.  We  went 
into the bunker. About 
a half an hour later, th
ey came back.  They found the soldiers
 on the street with the motorcycles 
and they destroyed the building.  We  heard the 
bombs.  What kind of bombs I don't know what 
they used, but the whole building when down.  Th
ey were thinking that the people were inside. 
Q. What did you do every day?   How did you spend the time ?  
A. Nothing.  Nothing.  We  just organized food a
nd that's it.  We  would eat and lay there and 
wait, what's  going to happen. 

Q. So, what did happen? 

A. What happened, they find our place as I told
 you.  We  had to come  out and they took us 
right in the mi ddle of the street. 
 We  were waiting there and then 
they destroyed old buildings at 
the same time.  We were standing right in th
e mi ddle and everything around me , around us, fire 
from the buildings that they destroyed.  They dest
royed the ghetto at that time.  I know about my 

area.  What happened on the other side, I don'
t know what happened there, but I know what 
happened around me .  I see fires from the bombs.  Th
at's what they did, and then they put us on 
the trucks.  They put us on the tr
ucks and we traveled a few miles away from that spot and there 
was a train.  There were trains 
waiting for us.  I was thinking I was going to Treblinka.  They 

were Polish trains, and then they took away my 
brother from me .  They put him in a different 
group across the street.  They asked who is a tailor
 and a furrier and I was 
standing together and I 
raised my arm and I said "I am a furrier."  And he
 raised his arm too and he said I am a tailor.  
They took him to the othe r group.  They said that
 this group will go to work for the Germans.  
Going to have a shop and the ta
ilors and furriers are going to wo
rk for them and I was here.  
Here's  what they did, they separate one brother fro
m the other, a sister -- you know what I mean.  
They separated them.  They took them away, they 
separated them.  Then my brother says to me , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
30 
 
 
come  on, come  over here.  Come  to me .  How 
could I go to him.  I was surrounded with the 
German sol diers with weapons.  How could I jump over to his group.  How could I do it.  He was 
thinking that he heard th
at this train goes to Tr
eblinka.  If this train 
goes to Treblinka he knew 
that I was going to be dead.  And I knew that he 
was going to be alive.  That's  why they'r e going 
to work for the German governme nt as tailors an
d furriers.  Then they changed their minds, the 
Germans.  I nstead of going to Treblinka, they took us to another camp, t o _________________.  

They changed their mi nd.  So, from ___________, I was there and from ____________ they put 

us to Maidonik and from Maidonik we went to
 Auschwitz and from Aus c hwitz we went to 

Buchenwald.  I was in four camps.  In Buchenwald I was liberated. 

 What happened with his group, they 
were supposed to go to ____________, too, his 
group, but to work for the Germans. 

Q. How did you know about all these camps be fo
rehand?   You said, "I thought they would 
take to Tr eblinka." 
A. Yes. 
Q. How did you know about all these pl aces? 

A. We had conversations with the people there. 

Q. With the Polish people? 

A. Yes.  We  had the conversations that this tr
ain will go to Treblinka.  So, then I was lucky. 
Q. But you already knew from your Polish cont
acts what Treblinka was.  How did you know 
what Treblinka was? 

A. We heard about it.  We  found out what Trebli
nka is from be fore, that
 Treblinka is a place 
where they put them in the gas chambers, and Birk
enau too, they have the gas chambers, next to 

Auschwitz.  Birkenau was connected 
with Auschwitz.  But it's a fact that I didn't see it before.  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
31 
 
 
didn't see the ovens where they pu
t the people into the ovens, how th
ey killed them there.  I just 
find out after the war when I was in Poland.  I vi
sited Poland and I went to Auschwitz and I saw 
these ovens.  We  couldn't see it.  Wh en I was 
in Auschwitz I couldn't see those ovens.  They 
didn't show them to us. 
Q. You were lucky. 

A. I'll tell you some thing else that they di
d in the concentration 
camps when the people 
arrived to the concentration camps.  They took 
away the children from the mothers from the 
parents.  There was a French commander, they 
call it.  They call it a Fr ench commander, fr om 
France they brought him over.  They used to wear 
French berets, red berets
, red shoes.  Those are 
specialized, -- they gi ve them the 
job to put the children in the ovens to burn them.  That was the 
French commander 's job. 

Q. Which camp are you talking about? 

A. This was a Maidonik.  They did the same  thing 
in Auschwitz.  This was their job to do it.  
The children taken away from their parents.  
Wi th the wome n, they took away the wome n from 
the me n, say it was a husband and wife.  All the 
wome n they took away and they put them in 
separate bloc ks and they use them as prostitute
s.  They made prostitu
tion places in the barracks 
for the women, which the soldiers they used them. 

Q. InMaidonik? 

A. Yes, in Maidonik, and in Auschwitz too.  It's  
a fact that some  days they came to us, they 
invited us to go to those places if we want to 
we can go to Bloc k Number four, and we can have 
a good time there.  We  can use the wo me n.  Every one was like a skeleton, he couldn't walk.  

You had no power to walk to go to a woma n to use 
a woma n.  It was a joke.  But they used them, 
the soldiers used them.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
32 
 
 
 In one camp, in Maidonik, they had the Jewi
sh from Warsaw, the kapos where I told you, 
the Germans they made a party in our block.  In
 our block they ma de 
just a party, you know, to 
drink to eat for them, and ther
e was a boy -- I forgot his name , he was supposed to be hanged.  
They were supposed to hang him up for some thing and then they asked the people from our, you 

know, who could sing.  I could sing. 
 I sang in a choir.  But he st
arted to sing, that boy that was 
supposed to be hanged and he started to sing 
you know the song "Mama --" an Italian song, a nd 
he was singing so good that the Germans started 
to like it and the Germ
ans said to him, you 
know some thing we'r e not going to hang you for that.  You are a good singer and we like the 

song and you know something from now on if we w
ill make a party you'll come to our party and 
you will si ng songs.  That's what happened and he saved his life this way. 

Q. Which of these camps were you in the longest? 

A. The longest camp I should say I was in Bu
chenwald, but I was lucky in Buchenwald.  
Why was I lucky?   They were looking for a tailor and there was another ma
n, a little older than I 
was, a tailor.  We  were laying on the beds and they said "Who is a tailor, raise your hand, raise 

your arm."  I raised my arm and the other fellow ra
ised his arm.  But actually I wasn't  a tailor.  
I'm not a tailor, I am a furrier and I was afraid.  
If I tell him I'm a tailor I figure I'm afraid maybe 
he'll tell me  "Look can you ma ke a pair of pants fo
r me  or can you take in a jacket or some thing."  
I didn't know this.  I took a chance -- they could 
hang me  for that.  And he picked me  and said, 
"You, you come  out."  And I went out and he explai
ned to me  what I have to do.  You see when 

the people are going out to work, you go to every be
d and see if the blankets have a rip or an 
opening and you close it up.  Oh, that's good.  That
's  a good job and since then I had good in 
Buchenwald.  I didn't go out for the countings, weused to go out in cold weather to count the 

people.  We  used to count every day the peopl
e and they used to ha
ng every day the people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
33 
 
 
 Before I got this job to stay in the block, not
 to go out, to fix the blankets, I used to go 
out, you know.  And I used to go out when they 
hung the people.  We  had to salute, you know.  
To salute means we had to take off the mitten, these bere ts that we used to wear and to stay 
straight and to salute.  We had 12,000 people at that
 time in that camp and I forgot, I concentrate 
on something and I forgot to take off that mitten.  An offi cer comes over to me and he tells me 

look, see everybody here?   Twelve thousand people
, look, you are the only one that didn't take 
off the mitten.  I said, "Look officer, I was c
oncentrating on my mother and my father, you 
know.  I was thinking about them and I just forg
ot.  I'm sorry."  He says, "Look, after we'r e 
finished here the things, this is my office there,
 you see, you come  into the office."  I said okay.  
I went into the office.  There was a kapo, the guy
 with the red hat, the red shoes and holding a 
stick, a heavy stick in his hands and he says he
 should give me  -- I had to drop my pants and go 
into a special table, to bend down, and he had to
 hit me  50 times over my back side.  They had 
the rules at the time, the regulations the Germans 
that if they broke a stick they should stop it.  
He broke the stick on 25 on me , that kapo.  And I 
was thinking I'm done.  He says to him take 
another stick and finish off on hi
m fifty.  So, he took another s
tick and finished to 50.  That 
happened after that I got this j
ob in the barrack and I had what 
to eat and I met that cook there 
and everything, he gave me  soups.  I was all right. 
Q. You were in Buchenwald how long? 

A. A few months.  Maybe eight m
onths, all together I was in t
hose camps short times.  They 
send me  from one camp into the other. 

Q. Which was the worst? 

A. Maidonik. 

Q. Why?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
34 
 
 
A. In Maidonik for every lit
tle thing they could kill you.  So
me  people some  survivors, for 
little thing they tell them to run all around.  
He was running so long until he fell and he 
collapsed.  If he didn't collapse they finished 
him up, not with weapons, 
but you try things, they 
beat him up until he died.  So, Maidonik I shoul
d say was a very, very bad camp.  In Maidonik, -
- Dr. Mengala came to Maidonik.  He picked the 
people.  He  was the expert on who was strong 
and who was weak.  Wh o was good for work, who is 
not good for work.  He picked -- he looked 
at the faces.  He walked by -- everyb
ody had to come  out and he picked ___________, 
___________, _________ to die and ___________ to work.  He picked me to work.  I was 

strong at that time. 

Q. How did you know it was Mengala? 

A. I heard the name .  It was Dr. Mengala.  
He was the expert on picking strong people and 
who is strong and who is not good to work, and he 
picked us.  As in one camp I could see with 
the children what happened too, which we'r e not 
supposed to look out, to open a window to open 
a door to see what the French comma nder did to
 the children.  That was about two o'clock at 
night.  I looked out and I had seen how they to
ok away the children.  They put them on trucks, 
the French commanders and they took them away. 

 So, in Buchenwald -- actually I 
was liberated in Buchenwald, in 1945. 
Q. I want to ask you a little bit more about the 
other camps because this is really important 
information to have. 

A. Maidonik wa s a very, very bad camp.  One of the worse camps was actually Maidonik 

and Maidonik was actually where they separate the women to make the prostitution houses for 

them.  That was in Maidonik. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
35 
 
 
Q. In terms of the general conditions wa s the f
ood or the crowdedness or all of that the same  
in all of these camps? 
A. Al most all the same .  They give you a pi
ece of bread.  A piece  of bread was enough for 
the whole day.  They gave you one soup, a bowlof soup.  That was actually good for the whole 

day.  We had the Hungarians in the camps.  What 
they did, the Hungarians, they saved the bread 
-- we had smokers, they smoked cigarettes.  They 
went to the toilets, to the men's room and 
smoked cigarettes.  But if they didn't have ciga
rettes, the Hungarians were organized and they 
had the cigarettes.  What the people did, they didn't
 eat the bread.  They wanted to smoke so they 
went to the Hungarian people, went to the toil
ets, like a black ma rket.  The guys were watching 
if the Germans are comi ng to the area.  They ma
de a deal.  They used to roll the tobaccos.  
They'd say, "How much?   I'll give you a piece of
 bread and you give me  tobacco."   He said, 
"How much bread are you going to 
give me ."  So the guy says, "L
ook, so much."  "Such a little 
piece of bread for tobacco.  That's  not enough.  I 
want more."   So, they got a guy says, "Look 
until here, another pi ece, okay?"  And they made a deal.  Cigarettes for bread or bread for 

cigarettes.  There was a black market in the men's room. 

Q. This was in Auschwitz or where? 

A. What? 

Q. Which camp was this in? 

A. This was in Maidonik 
and in Buchenwald too. 

Q. With the Hungarians? 

A. Most of them were Hungarian people, most of
 them.  I could tell in the Jewish speaking, I 
find out that they were Hungarians.
  I was sleeping with 
the Hungarian people, with a few, in the 
camp, together in one room. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
36 
 
 
Q. The first camp you were in, how long were you there? 
A. Where? 

Q. The first camp you were sent to? 

A. A short time. Everywhere I was but a fe
w months .  The longest camp was  Buchenwald 
where I was liberated.  It was the longest camp as 
I reme mber.  In Auschwitz I was a short time .  
They put the numbers on me  when I went to regist
er even in Auschwitz.  
To register I had to go 
up the steps there on the second floor to register
.  The guys with the red hats standing on the 
steps and beating the people going u
p.  A lot of them died on the 
steps fr om the hitting.  They 
collapsed.  Then they put numbers outside -- ther
e were tables, you know.  A long line of tables 
and they put the numbers, the tattoos on my arm.  

Q. What is your number? 

A. 127965 was my number.  They put the needles under the skin.  After th
at, we registered.  
They didn't call us by the name s in the con
centration camps.  They called the numbers. 
Q. When you went to a different camp, di
d you get a new number 
you had to wear or 
some thing or did you always go by this first number? 

A. No, no.  This was the number.  They didn't give other numbers.  This was the number. 

Q. So, when you were in Maidonik or Buch
enwald, you went by the number you had from 
Auschwitz? 

A. Sure.  They used -- they
 didn't use name s at all. 
Q. But you never got a new number in each camp? 

A. No, this was the number for all concentration camps.  They called the number. 

Q. So, the first camp you were sent to, this _______________? 

A. _______________,yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
37 
 
 
Q. Tell me a little bit about it. 
A.  ___________________ wasn't  bad.  It wasn't  bad.  
We  just went to work.  We  carried 

stones, we carried bricks.  We  used to carry pi
pes on the shoulders.  They used to ma ke the 
underground canalizations, the pipes for toilets and di
fferent kinds of things.  That was the work.  
It wasn't  too bad.  The worst two camps was Bu
chenwald and Maidonik.  Maidonik I should say 
was one of the toughest.  Buchenwald I had good. 

Q. Let's stick with this ___________ first.  Give 
me  a little bit more de
scription about it in 
terms of the barracks, the other people there. 
 Can you just tell me ?   I don't know too much about 
this camp, t hat's  why I'm asking you. 

A. No, I tell you it wasn't  -- there we had the 
me ister, me ister means "the boss,"  a German.  
He was good to us.  He wasn't  bad to us.  He was good and he just told us to do the work, when 

to fi nish the work.  But there's a lot of Jewish
 people but we were working together but they 
were no good.  They were no good one to each other.  
One is jealous.  He didn't want to hard.  
He told somebody else to do this.  I mean, it wa
s a selfishness between the workers themselves, 
with the Jewish people themselves in th
e concentration camps and a lot of places. 
Q. Did you have any buddies? 

A. I had, I should say, two people, which I ha
d arguments with them.  Working with them, 
they were trying to be close to the meister, th
e boss, and they shouldn't work.  They walked out 
from that hole, from that digging and they left me  to dig.  You know what I mean.  The r e was a 

lot of selfishness and some  of the m they were 
no good.  Some from differ e nt towns.  I don't want 
to mention actually t he names from the towns,
 but I know the town was from Poland which the 
people were not so good.  I don't want to me ntion the towns. 

Q. Did you also have good relationships 
with some  of the 
other prisoners?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
38 
 
 
A. Yes. 
Q. You had some  buddies? 

A. Yes, I had good relationship in Buchenwa
ld.  I was sleeping with another guy.  He 
received packages from t he Red Cross.  I think he received from Sweden a nd he gave it to me , a 

lot of bread he gave me  to eat and he helped me
.  He was very good to me .  He was a very nice 
guy.  I had in some  ca mps, you know, everybody suffered the same  way.  We  had to stick 

together. 

Q. So, you helped each other? 

A. Yes, we helped eachothe r, but he helped me
.  That's why he received the packages.  Not 

me , I didn't  receive anything.  One time  I re me mber we traveled to Buchenwald to the 

Czechoslovakian border, was on the Czechos
lovakian border on open trains and the 
Czechoslovakian people are very ni
ce, very good people.  And they
 were standing there with an 
open train and they threw packages, food, to the trai
ns to us they wanted to help us, you know.  
The Germans didn't let them do it.  They started 
to scream go away, go away.  That's it.   

Q. Was there much violence in ________________? 

A. Violence, I would say no, but I he
ard in talking about __________________, no as I 
know I didn't experience the violence there.  What
 I didn't like in Maidonik those two Jewish 
couples the way they were treat
ing the Jewish people.  They were Jewish too.  They were 

thinking they were going to serve themselves a
nd they were working with the Germans together. 
Q. Do you remember their name s?  

A. Yes.  I don't know if I have to say the na
me s, ma ybe they'r e still alive.  Wh o knows. 
Q. If you reme mber their name s it mi ght be --?

A. _______________ was one name .  The other name  was _____________ they call it.  
Those two names. 

Q. Now, in Maidonik was there a lot of brutality? 

A. In Maidonik?   Maidonik was mo
re tough, you know, than say _____________ or the 

other camps.  Maidonik was in Poland. 
 _____________ was in Poland.  Auschwitz was in 
Poland.  The only camp which wasn't in Poland was Buchenwald.   

Q. Tell me  a little bit more about Maidonik. 
 What kind of work did you do there and how 
long were you there? 

A. I did the same  kind of work, you know, cutting 
stones, pipes, things like that.  Digging, 
the same  kind of work, but not in the camp, outside the camp.  When we came into the camp, 

there was music, an orchestra at the entrance
, a German orchestra, German music and they 
played those me lodies, which some times I hear
 those me lodies on Germa n shows and that 

remi nds me.  Those mel odies comi ng back from wo
rk, they said to us at the entrance we should 
work to the music and ____________ lik
e nothing happened.  That's  
how we had to march into 
the camp, back into the camp from work, and the music was playing. 

Q. Were the musicians Jewi sh or German? 

A. Germanmu sic. 

Q. Played by Germans? 

A. Played by Germans.  It's a fact if I have 
to tell you, how my c ousin find me when I was in 
Israel.  I left both name s.  The name  from Poland.
  His name  was Svibaum, too, in the fa mily.  I 
left in ______________, they have regist
ry there.  They have com
puters there, a big computer 
system and I left my two name s, the name  now 
in Cherry Hill where I live, Jack Baum and

Q. Tell me  a little bit about Ausc
hwitz.  What were you doing there? 
A. In Auschwitz I did the same  thing what I di
d in the other camps.  The same kind of work 
they give you to carry pipes, di
gging, stones, carrying, bricks, you know. 
Q. Did it seem to be useful work? 
A. Useful for them, to help them.  I was in ___________.  ____________ was another camp.  

When I was in ______________in ___________ they call it, when I was in 

_________________, the Germans they start to build
 the _____________ they call it, and I was 
working there.  Every time  we build up some thi
ng, the English planes, from England, they start 
to bomb.  We couldn't finish this job.  And the ___________ it's supposed to be the biggest 

German factory in Europe.  That's what they'r
e supposed to build.  But 
the English I reme mber 
what they used to say, the ______________________, and th
ey used to come  every time  and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
43 
 
 
bomb.  They couldn't finish this
 job.  Then the Americans actua
lly after the war the Americans 
they took over the ___________________. 
Q. Did this give you encouragement when the English was bombing? 

A. I was running away.  I just run away.  Th
ey were running away too.  The Germans, too, 
they'r e trying to save themselves and I was trying
 -- we were trying, the workers.  We  were just 

running away. 

Q. But when you saw these British pl anes, did it
 ma ke you think that ma ybe the war will be 

over soon?  

A. We couldn't think about it.  We  were th
inking you know that that's  going to help, you 
know, that they bombed them.  How long is it goi
ng to take.  We couldn't figure out that.  We  
were trying to do the best we could to save ourselves.  That's  all. 

Q. What kind of a factory was this goin
g to be?  Was it a chemical factory? 
A. Yes, a chemical factory and what they used
 the chemicals to make bullets, bombs, that 
was supposed to be the bi ggest in Europe.  Hitler 
says that's going to be the biggest  in Europe. 
They never finished it. 

Q. So, is this -- when you talk about Auschwitz
 were you talking about 
Buna or was that a 
separate experience? 

A. Buna is something else.  They are separate
, but actually, Buna -- this camp was in Poland 
too.  The mo st suffering, the Jewish commun
ities, people don't know, I don't know about what 
happened in Hungary.  I do not know what happe
ned in Sweden.  I do not know what happened 
in France.  They all suffered, but the most suffe
ring -- the Polish people had the most suffering in 
Poland.  It wa s the worst spot. 

Q. What I was trying to understand is you were
 both in Auschwitz proper and also in Buna? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
44 
 
 
A. Yes. 
Q. And in Auschwitz were you in 
Auschwitz or the Birkenau part? 
A. I was in Auschwitz.  The Birkenau part was 
more deadly.  In Birkenau you had the ovens, 
which I didn't  see them.  As I told you I just sa
w after the war when I visit Wa rsaw, then I looked 
at these ovens, but I didn't  see them before. 

Q. Is there anything that really st
ands out in your mi nd about Auschwitz? 
A. About Auschwitz?   Auschwitz was a very 
bad spot, what can I t ell you.  A very bad 
concentration camp.  Some  people it actually was the 
start for them when they put the numbers.  
They finished them up there too.  They started an
d they finished them up.  They didn't come  out.  
You had to be lucky, actually, to come  out in 
one piece.  The other camps  were not bad.  The 

___________________ were not bad. 

Q. But when you say it was especially bad for you --? 

A. For me  I wa s trying to do the best by wh
atever they told me , I was trying good to talk 
nice to them, you know, to the kapos.
  For instance in Buchenwald, two days before the war --.

Q. Perhaps you can tell me  a little bit about 
Buchenwald because that's where you spent the 
most time. 

A. Buchenwald, a few days before the end of 
the war -- I didn't know that it was going to be 
a few days before the end of the war, but
 the ma nager our ___________ what we called it in 
German, was Polish.  He knew that it's going to take
 ma ybe two or three days it's going to be the 
end of the war.  But the Germans they still be
 looking around for the Jewish people to pull them 
out and to kill them.  The r e were a few mountains 
there.  They put them into the mountains there 
with machine guns and they finished them up.  Ev
en at that time they knew it was the end of the 
war.  So the Polish ____________, the ma nager from the block came to us and he knew that we 

are Jewish pe ople.  We  had a couple Gentiles ther
e too, a few people.  And he says to us, he 
knew that we were Polish Jewish people and he 
says to us, "Look, pretty soon a German officer 
will come  in here to the block and he's going to 
look for the rest of the Jewish people to take 

them out and to finish them."  He sa ys, "I 
know that you are Jewish, Polish Jewish and I am 
trying to help you so now it's up to you.  You have 
to decide what to do, to stay in the block 
inside or to go out and hide yourse
lf."  I decided to stay.  Ther
e were two brothers, their name s 
was Vina, two brothers and they 
had longer nose than I had.  I had a short at that time  little 
pointy nose.  So, he says to them, "Look, I know 
the Germans they know that the Jewish people 
have long noses.  And he will come  into the bl
ock, the German officer, and he will look at you.  
He'll take you out.  I don't want to be responsible
.  That's why I tell you that."  That's what he 
says, the ma nager.  It was nice for him to tell th
at.  And they took a chance, the brothers and the 
others.  All others were standi
ng up, the officer came  into the block.  You had to stand in one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
46 
 
 
line, you know, stand up, and he started to walk, wa
lk and look at the faces.  He walked by me .  
He looked at those two br others, into the faces
, look, look, and he let them go.  He walked by 
them.  He di dn't take out a single person from the block.  They were lucky.   

 So this was one thing.  Now a sec
ond thing.  The Polish ma nager, the ______________, 
said to us, "Look, it's going to be pretty soon 
the end of the war and you can do whatever you 

want.  It's up to you.  If they get you, they'll 
get you.  Maybe some body e l se will come in to look 
up to the people, to take them out."  What I did, 
I went under the block, to 
hide myself.  At that 
time it was raining and damp and wet underneath a
nd I didn't eat, nothing.  We  wanted to see the 
end of the war.  And I was laying there underneat
h and then a guy -- we couldn't get up.  It was 
underneath.  You couldn't stand up, nothing.  You 
had to lay there and one guy come s to me  on 
his stomach, comes closer to me and he says
, "Show me  your hand."  And I showed him my 
hand and he started to do it like 
this and he started to do it like th
is, and I show hi m.  He  said, 
"You know some thing, I think I don't have a watch. 
 We  don't  have watches, but roughly I would 
say about a half an hour we will be liberated."  I 
heard this, I thought to myself, what he's crazy!  
How does he know.  And it was I should say about 
a half an hour and I hear screaming, hurray 
and this and that and we came out.  We ca me  out
.  There were Hungarian people but they came  
over to that person who told me  that in half an ho
ur we'll be liberated.  It came  out that he was a 
rabbi from Budapest.  They start to kiss him, 
to grab him, the Hungarian people.  Then, came 
into the block, a rabbi ________________, he was an officer in the Seventh Ar my.  He  wrote a 
book, "I Liberated Buchenwald."  That was him,
 and he came to our block with two Jewish 
soldiers.  They start to 
talk Jewish to us.  Now he wrote th
at book, "I Liberated Buchenwald" and 
he was in my synagogue as my rabbi invited him,  
and he had a speech.  He  told the story that he 
liberated Buchenwald, what happened, and he sai
d, "Is some body here that was in Buchenwald? "   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
47 
 
 
And I stood up and I raised my ar m.  He said, "Oh, 
come  on up."  I went to the stage and he says, 
"See, I have a live witness." 
 I said "Yes, rabbi, you're looking pretty good, you look good and 
that time you looking pretty good I 
recognize you.  You liberated my
 block.  You came  into my 
block and that was block number one
, it says it right on the corner."  And he says, "Yes."  So, he 
was a guest in my synagogue. 
 So, this was at that time  the end actually of 
the war.  They find a lot of German soldiers 
on the towers.  They took them off a nd they t
ook them away.  What th
ey did with them, the 
Americans, that was very, very interesting.  
What happened, I was looking to do some thing, to 
go out.  To do some thing, I didn't know what to do.  And I walked, walked with the two brothers 

that were in the same  block.  We  walked 
in the direction of _____________ in the city where 

Hitler built his Nazi 
party there.  I started to 
sing "Where shall I go, where shall I go."   I started 
to sing in Jewish ___________________, and I started to
 sing this song and a Germa n woma n 
heard me  singing and she pulled me  into the house. 
 She invited me , she wanted me  to sleep over 
there, but I didn't want it.  I didn't know what wa
s going to happen here.  We had to stay in the 
place, but she gave me to eat.  At that time 
she says "You're singing very nice.  I like your 
singing.  What are singing?"  So, then I had to 
go back.  I went back and the Seventh Ar my 
organized us and then they put us on trains 
and we went to Landsberg, our group went to 
Landsberg, which that was before a German ca
mp and the Americans took away from them.  
They should have a place where to put us in.  So
, we went there and we lived there and the room 
where I was I had about six or se
ven people sleep in there, two beds.  That's the place where I 
me t my wife , through some body.  That's the camp I wa
s and I took, I had a job at that time, they 
give me  a big job I should take care that the cam
p should be clean.  I took over this job, to take 
care, to be the ma nager, that the camp should be
 clean.  Clean the steps, rooms and everything.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
48 
 
 
Then I took over, which I have th
e picture I think with me .  Gene
ral Lucius Clay came  into the 
camp and I started to look and he liked the job th
at I di d, and there was a 
chief of police, which 
he didn't want to be anymore the chief of the poli
ce.  He went to the United States.  He went 
through the trouble to go to America.
  I took over as an assistant 
from hi m his job which Lucius 
Clay gave me the job.  I have th
e picture here.  I think I should ha
ve the picture here with another 
fellow, which he was a sergeant 
with me.  We ma de a picture 
and the guy who introduced me  to 
my wife.  He was in the picture. 
 He was in the police de partme nt.  It's a fact that he's in Israel 
now and here I think a sewing factory.  I was looking up for the other sergeant who I was with 
him, I went to New York and I came to the Unit
ed States and I couldn't 
find him.  I was looking 
for him.  I c ouldn't find him.  

Q. Let me  ask you a few questions about your li
beration in Buchenwald and then I want to 
ask you about Landsberg as well. 

A. Yes. 
Q. When you were liberated did the prisoners 
try to retaliate at all against the German 
guards?   Wa s there any of that or were had they gone? 
A. No, they grabbed a few of them.  Ac tuall
y, they didn't do anything.  Wh at could they do 
with them.  They gave them to the Americans, to the Seventh Ar my, to the soldiers.  Whatever 

they did with them, I don't know.  They actually, 
they didn't kill them right away, right there, 
with machine guns.  Wh atever happens with them, th
ey just got them and that's  it, as prisoners. 
Q. Did the American soldiers feedyou?  Did they give you me di cal --? 

A. Yes.  They took ma ybe not even an hour, truc
ks came into that camp 
with a lot, a lot of 
food, all kinds of food.  It's a fact that people we
re eating so much that they would die and they 
would choke themselves and they died from over
eating.  That's  what happened right there, right 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
49 
 
 
in Buchenwald.  That's how much food they got. 
 They give us plenty
 to eat, plenty, from 
everything.  Yes, they bring in 
me dicines and everything, doctors, 
everything.  It didn't take long. 
Q. Did you go through a process.  I mean did they clean you, did they delouse you, any of 
that kind of thing? 

A. No, actually, not specially.  They took us
 away.  They give us in Landsberg, it was 
everything.  In the kitchen they give us 
to eat, everything was organized there. 
Q. How long were you in Buchenwald after liberation before you went to Landsberg? 

A. A short time. 

Q. A few weeks or a few days? 

A. Not a few days, the same  day they took us 
away.  We  didn't go back to the barracks to 
sleep.  Oh no, it was finished.  I don't know if ev
erybody went to Landsberg.  Some  of them went 
to Salzheim, you know.  They se
parated two groups I think. 
Q. Do you remember how you were 
feeling when you got liberated? 
A. Like I was liberated? 

Q. How you we re feeling? 

A. The feeling was -- I had a ba
d feeling, I had nobody.  I lost th
e whole family.  That's  what 
I was thinking. That was the first th
ing, that I was left alone.  Th
at was the worst thing to me .  
So, I suppose to go at that time  to Treblinka on 
the train and you see I was one of the lucky ones, 
but how good is it that I lost a w
hole fa mily.  I was left alone. 
Q. Did you have thoughts about trying to 
go back to Wa rsaw and find people? 
A. Actually I wanted to go back to Wa rsaw
 to find out, you know, but I knew, I knew that I 

wouldn't find anybody.  I knew what happened with 
them.  They were all dead.  The only thing 
that I was thinking was ma ybe go ba ck to Wa
rsaw and ask, ma ybe go to the governme nt and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
50 
 
 
ma ybe they have some  records or some thing, but
 my brother, that was the only thing.  But I 
figured, who am I going to ask.  You see, the Ge
rmans, they destroyed the documents.  They 
destroyed everything.  No records.  So, I didn't wa
nt to go back, but I went back but it was with 
my group, with my synagogue, my r a bbi.  We  went
 back now about three years ago.  We  went 
back to Wa rsaw and that's all. 
Q. Before we talk about Landsberg, is th
ere anything else you want to add about 
Buchenwald? 

A. Yes.  The last few days in Buchenwald before the end of the war, I had to go to work.  

They took me out to work and I worked in a ce
rtain place there and we had a guard, a German 
soldier with the machine gun watching us, we s
hould run away.  We  were working there and one 
guy was sick and tired, he couldn't take it anymore. 
 So, what happened, they
 had the rule at that 
time, the Germans, if you walked away from 
the place where you worked, say you worked in this 
area.  When you start to walk away 50 feet the so
ldier had the right to shoot the person, to kill 
him.  So, tha t  guy, one guy was tired.  He didn't car
e.  He started to walk away from the place 

where he did the work.  So, that German soldie
r who was wa tching us went to that guy.  He 
walked about ten, fifteen feet away already and he 
wanted to start to walk, 
so he started to walk, 
so that soldier walked over to him a nd he says to him, " Why are you walking away from the 

place where you work.  You know I have the right 
to shoot you if you walk 50 feet away from 
the place you work."  He says, "I don't care.  Shoot
 me .  I 'm sick and tired 
of it already. I want to 
die."  He says, "You're foolish.  The war will take
 another fe w days.  It's going to be the end of 
the war.  Why do you do this.  Don't do this.  Co me
 back."  And he walked back to the place.  
That was very nice from that sold
ier to tell him that.  He didn't  want to shoot him.  He didn't 
want to kill him.  It's a fact that a 
few days later it was the end of the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
51 
 
 
Q. Did you think the end of the war was comi ng?  
A. If the war was comi ng do you mean? 

Q. Did you think the war was going to 
end soon, did you think maybe finally? 
A. That's what I heard, and I heard from that guy. 

Q. I wanted to ask you about Landsberg, but firs
t is there anything else
 you want to fill in 
from Warsaw? 

A. If you want to know about the rabbis, I'll 
tell you what happened with the 11 rabbis.  
They were rabbis usually from Europe.  They ca
me , most of them, from small towns and they 
settled in Wa rsaw.  You don't know t hose towns, 
if would be some body from Poland I would tell 
them, from what of towns they settled in Wa
rsaw.  The rabbi who lived in my apartment 
building, he was there too, with the eleven.  There 
were a lot of other rabbis, very popular rabbis 
in Poland.  They'r e not the rabbis you have here.  
Here the rabbis in the United States, they have 
money.  They invest in properties.  They invest
 in land.  All those kind 
of things.  They live 
good.  They have luxury home s.  The rabbis in 
Europe, say in Warsaw, 
they were very poor, 
poor rabbis.  They had a hard time
 even to organize some  food.  Th
ey had nothing to eat.  So, if 
you came into a rabbi at that time 
into his apartment, his office, 
they were stinking -- it smelled 
from the books, from the things from the learning.  They used to learn day and night, and poor.  

They had nothing.   

 So, what happened with those rabbis, they took 
them out from the attic.  They told them 
to take off their clothes, all naked.  They put 
them against that partic
ular wall and they shoot 
them with the machine guns, they finish them up. 

Q. Did you see this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
52 
 
 
A. Yes, I saw it.  This was when I was in the 
center street.  I told th
em when they took me 
out, they took them out from the attic too, at th
e same ti me, and I watched it and I could see how 
they shoot them with a machine gun, all eleven rabbi
s.  At that time  people start to ask question 
"Where 's God, where was God, where is God? " 
 Highly rabbis, strict
ly highly rabbis, poor 
people.  They would learn day and night and w
hy did God let them do it.  Why didn't God show 
a mi racle at that time to save those rabbis.   
Q. And Wa rsaw was burning all around you, or the ghetto? 

A. Sure.  Then they burned everything.  The w
hole area was burning at th
at time .  Then they 
took us and put us on the trucks and th
at was it.  We went to the trains. 
Q. Do you remember what you were thinking at the time? 

A. What I was thinking?   What could I think 
at that time ?   Nothing good.  All bad.  I was 
thinking what are they going to do with us next, you know. 

Q. From Warsaw to the various camps you were 
sent to, at what place di d you think that this 
mi ght really be the end for you? 

A. I didn't know that this is th
e end.  I expect it's going to be
 very, very bad, after they took 
us out.  We  were fighting against them.  What could I expect
 good here?   Nothing.  I expect 
actually the worst, but I didn't 
know what's going to be.  I was thinking ma ybe they were going 

to take us to the gas chambers. 

Q. Was there a time when you were mo
r e afraid than a
nother time or not? 
A. I tell you about the same .  You could never tell what the Germans are going to do next, 

what they'r e going to do next.  It was very hard
 to predict thin
gs like that.  Nothing good.  You 
couldn't predict nothing good.  Everything bad. 

Q. There was ne ver an especially close call? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
53 
 
 
A. No. 
Q. How was the life in Landsberg? 

A. Life in Landsberg?   In the beginning it was 
hard.  I had to look around what to do after 

the concentration camp.  I was poor.  I had nothin
g, almost naked, nothing to wear.  I had to look 
around what to do.  So, you know, I came out from it.  That's it.  The only thing I was glad you 

know and happy to find some body fr om my fa mi ly, my
 cousin.  I was happy really.  I wouldn't 
believe that I'm going to have another Svibaum, my
 fa mily.  I find  him -- actually he find me .  I 
didn't find him.  I would never find him.  How co
uld I find him.  I changed from Svibaum into 
Baum.  But he changed from Svibaum into Svibon. 
 I would never find a Svibon into a Svibaum.  
I wouldn't find him, never. 

Q. Was Landsberg well organized? 

A. Yes.  I organized a lot of things.  First 
of all, in Landsberg, the camp wa s clean like a 
whistle under my management. Then he give me 
another job, Lucius Clay, the general.  He came 
in.  He liked it.  He liked my job what I wa
s doing, and it's a fact that I have papers from 
Landsberg which it's written that I am 
one of the best workers in Landsberg. 
Q. Were there sc hools and traini
ng for people?   Tell me  a little bit about the camp itself, the 

life there, you know wha t  I mean? 

A. Nothing actually.  It was nothing.  They we
re eating and eating, drinking and eating and 
that's it.  Everybody was trying to
 organize themselves.  To meet
 girls, to me et boys, to get 
ma rried, things like that.  So, that's what happe
ned.  The Americans didn't send them to work.  

This was only a short time.  That's why everybody
 was trying to find some  way to ma ke  a living 
and to meet people. 

Q. Were there vocational training schoo
ls or anyt hing like that in there?

A. Actually what I know now I didn't see anyt
hing.  They organized -- they ma de the police 
department.  We should watch if something 
happens to the Germans to find, you know, some  
spies or whatever.  There was the police depart
me nt and the cleaning departme nt.  There was a 
big kitchen for the people together to eat.  The Am
ericans, they supplied a lo
t of food.  That's  all. 
Q. Were you living in houses or in barracks? 

A. We were actually living, it was actually 
I wouldn't say barracks.  They were like 

apartments, the building.  What 
they put a lot of people into on
e room and a few beds into one 
room. 

Q. Who ran the camp?  

A. The camp?  Well, there was American
s, Americans they took care of it. 
Q. Did people start celebrating Jewish holiday
s?  Did all of this
 start taki ng place? 
A. Yes,yes. 

Q. That must have been a ni ce feeling?  
A. Yes, it was nice but actually we didn't  -- 
we organized a place where we should have a 
service, but we didn't know actually where the 
synagogues -- we didn't know
 those things yet. 
Q. But you sort of did what you could? 

A. It was a temporary thing. 

Q. How long did you stay in Landsberg? 

A. In Landsberg, not too long, about afew months or some thing like that. 

Q. Andthen? 

A. That's it.  They had to empty all these camps, Salzheim, La ndsberg.  There was a 

______________ which they put people in ______________.  They had to empty it and give it 

back to the Germans.

Q. So, where did you go after Landsberg? 
A. After Landsberg I went to Salzheim wher
e I met my wife.  Fr om there I moved to 
Munich.  I went to Munich I start to work, to ma
ke some  mo ney.  I started to ma ke coats, rabbit 
coats.  The rabbit coats were in styl e at that ti
me, grey coats.  The American Army, the American 
soldiers, they met the German girls and I made th
e coats for them, and I made the coats for them, 
for the American soldiers.  They paid me  with sc
ripts, the soldiers, they get scri pts in the Army, 
not dollars at that time.  I changed the 
scripts for dollars.  That's  what I did. 
Q. How were your relationships were the Germ
an population at that
 time?   Did you have 
contact with them? 

A. I tell you after the war, I 
wouldn't believe it that the Germans could do some thing like 
this.  I couldn't  believe it.  I me t nice people, but
 I find myself nice people
.  I met nice people.  
They treat me nice and I wouldn't believe it that 
they could do some thing like this.  Cl ean people 
and nice, and they all liked me  and I used to li
ke them.  Nice and clean, 
it is unbelievable that 
they could do something like this. 

Q. How long did you stay in Germany after the war? 

A. After the war, I was until 1949.  I came  in 
1949 in October, I think, I came to the United 
States. 

Q. What do you think got you through all this?   
What gave you the strength to get through 
all these very, very difficult expe riences? 

A. I had very, very difficult experiences, which I don
't  believe myself that I'll be able to take 
it.  The worst thing for me  is that I lost a famil
y.  That is the worst thing for me  and I had to hope 
and the way some body t old me  whe n I went to Atlant
ic City -- I used to go 
to Atlantic City, there 
I met somebody sitting on a porch. 
 I rented an apartment at th
at time .  Some body was sitting on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
56 
 
 
a porch and he asked me my na me, fr om where I 
am, you know, and I told him.  I described to 
him my brother, how my  brother looked and ever
ything.  He was a furrier.  He says to me , "You 
know some thing, the way you tell me about your br
other, the way you describe him, I me t a ma n 
in Sweden, and I think that this must be your brot
her.  The wa y you tell me
 about your brother.  
He was a furrier.  He was from Wa rsaw.  And th
e way you describe to me  the way he looked, his 
height and everything, that this 
is your brother, and I was talki
ng with him.   And your brother 
says to me , you know some thing, I don't like it here.  I'm goi ng to move from here.  And he just 
went some place.  I don't know what happened with him.
"  That's it.  So, I was thinking that in the 
way that he was so sure that this
 is my brother that he's  alive. 
 And I started to look for him at 
that time.  I started to search.  The Re d Cross 
and different organizations
.  You know, wherever I 
had a chance that's what I did, until now.  He didn'
t show up yet.  After so ma ny years so I don't 
know what I shall say.  I don't know i f I could stil
l find my br other after so ma ny years.  And the 
way I look for him, ma ybe he would look for me  too, the same way. 
Q. How i mportant was religion 
to you throughout 
all of this? 
A. Not so important, the religi
on, after all, after thos
e things happened.  I stopped to believe 
in that.  First of all, how could God do some thi
ng like this to let kill so ma ny people, such high 

people, rabbis, distinguished people and good people.  They didn't kill.  They didn't rob.  Why?   

So, at that time  a lot of J e wish peopl
e they stopped just believing in God. 
Q. Does being Jewish me
a n anything to you today? 
A. Today?   Look, I know I'm Jewish.  I was Jewish
 for so ma ny years, and I like to be a Jew.  
I have to believe.  You have to believe in so
me thing, especially I had a very religious fa mily, 
believers.  They believe in God.  I was seven years old and I used to go already with my father to 

the synagogue.  When I was seven years old, and 
I was learning and I study Hebrew.  I study  the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
57 
 
 
Bible and I know a lot about it.  
So, I started to believe in it, 
but what I saw, you know, what I 
experienced, I just couldn't  figure out what 
happened.  How to believe in those things. 
Q. But  you do again.  What you're saying is it's 
part of you?   Wa s it di
fficult to begin a new 
after all of this, to 
start your life again? 
A. After the concentration camps you mean?   Itwa sn't  easy.  It was hard, but I find a job in 
Germany, I find a job.  I lived in Frankfurt.  Fran
kfurt was very close to Salzheim.  When they 
closed up Salzheim, the camps, and the Americans 
I guess they ma de some  kind of a n agreement 
to give back to the Germans,
 I think, the camps.  This was a temporary.  I found a job in 
Frankfurt and I worked for a German furrier there.
  I wanted to ma ke some money.  So, he paid 
me  in Ger man money, not too much, a little bit, but anyway, as long as I find some thing to do.  

He was so friendly with me .  He 
got so friendly with me  that at 
lunch time we used to play ping 
pong in his attic.  And when I left
 Frankfurt he says to me , I sa
id I'm going to go to the United 
States.  I am going to go to America.  He 
says, "Look, when you will ma ke $100 a week, you let 
me  know.  You call me  and I will close my bus
i ness and I will go to the United States if you 
ma ke $100."   When I ma de the $100 a week in the 
United States, I called him up and I told him, 
"Look I'm making $100 a week are you going to come  
to the United States?"  He says, "I don't 
know.  I changed my mi nd.  I'm going to stay here." 

Q. Let me  ask you one mor e  question.  Have 
you thought about sort of
 what the long term 
effect of all of these experien
ces has been on your life.  I mean
 besides losing your family, and i 
Know that's the most significant, but the way 
that you've lived your life since then, when you 
came to America, you had a wife.  You had child
ren.  Can you think of wa
ys that those earlier 
experiences effected
 the way you live now? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
58 
 
 
A. Yes, I tell you it's very hard to forget th
e experiences from the Holocaust .  I will neve r 
forget that, and we shouldn't forget it.  That's  wh
a t  we should do.  It's very hard to forget the 
experiences from the ghettos, from the concentration camps. 
Q. Because you think about it, I'm sure, daily, di d that impact the way you did a certain 

thing, the way you worked, the way you raised your
 children?   Is there wa ys that ma ybe you 
acted differently than some body who didn'
t go through that, do you know what I me an? 
A. The time I'm here in the United States, I sa y that the American people are just lucky 

people.  They didn't live through that.  They are rea
lly lucky people.  It's a mi racle I tell you what 
happened, that the Germans lost 
the war.  The Germans, they almost occupied Russia and 
Stalingrad.  Stalin actually I shoul
d say as bad as he was I think 
he saved the world.  He started 
to push the Germans ba ck from Stalingrad all th
e way to Berlin.  If the Ge rmans would occupy, 
they would take Russia, the world would be lost. 
 So, the Americans are just lucky people, I tell 
you, that they didn't live through that and they 
didn't  see that and didn't know that, what 
happened in Europe. 

 The worst spot was Poland, I don't know what happened in Hungary, but in the way I 

heard after I read the stor ies that Poland was the worst spot. 

Q. Is there anything else you want to add? 

A. What can I tell you?   There's actually no end to it. 

Q. Are there images that still 
linger with you after 50 years? 
A. Yes, it's still in my mi nd. 

Q. A specific image? 

A. Still in my mi nd.  I can never forget, you know
.  Those people, as long as they'r e going to 
live, I guarantee you, they'll never forget it.  It's 
always going to be in their mi nd.  A very bad, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0424  
59 
 
 
very bad experience.  And they shouldn't forget 
it, and we shouldn't forget that, and don't let it 
happen again.  That's  important.  
It could happen again.  So, that's
 the story of my life.  Not 
stories from the books or the papers, but stories 
of what I lived through, and I'm the live witness, 
as the rabbi said to me .  He says, "I have here
 a live witness."  And 
he liberated Buchenwald. 
Q. Thankyou.
