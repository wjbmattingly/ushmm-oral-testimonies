don't  re me mber, met  her  in Berli n, 
in Pra gue , Cz e choslovaki a and took
 he r  to a bea uti
ful resort  in 
Cze chosl ova kia i n Marie nba d so was  a ti me  
I wasn't  even born 
when my mother, my 
 
older  si ster  s t aye d wit h t h

Occ upation -  business ma n a nd then re al est ate .
 
 
Do you wa nt  to tell , do y

Sure, sure, sure like I sai d, we 
had one old apartment 
house and ma ybe you h
eard about, he was an 
artist Arthur Shick.
 
His  pare nts  l i ved i n  our, t he  ot her  a par t me nt  house.
  We  had a beautiful pict
ure when the Jews going 
out  from Egypt  and one of t he
 
women in the pi ctur e wa

e veryt hing, you know, 
 
beca use  my pare nts  ran a wa y, I w
ill tell you late

so his wi fe  survived he
re and when I came here
 I r e ad about  in t he
 
Ti mes ma gazine she showed me  
______________[29] all his art y
ou know how beautiful he was 
painti ng.  Hi s par ent s use d to be  ver y wea lthy but 
then I read not long ago 
duri ng t he re vol ution in  
Russia in l905 they burned his fa
ther 's eyes.  I  saw hi
m when he was an el
derly man, you know. 
The  Poli sh worker s, ma ybe  Ger ma n s,
 
because ther e were many
 Ger ma ns in our  city a nd duri ng the  war they
 
named our 
city Littsmanstadt. 
 Did you know about
 
 

Right , ri ght .
 
 
Did you talk some  people from
 Lodz t hat you know about?
 
 
Ye s, yes  we 've wo rke d wit h a nu mb
er of pe opl e.  Coul d we  go bac k 
a little bit to your childhood. 
So you co mplete d high s chool
, you went to high school?
 
 
Yes to high school.  Our 
grades were different.  T
ill 8th grade,   then we 
graduated to get Matura,  
Polish Maturan came
 fr om the government, se
nt two men and we had wr
itten and oral tests.  
Other wise  we c oul dn't go to unive r
sit y, anyway we c oul dn't go for  
everyt hi ng so it 
was a very hard 
thing from all the subjects they asked questions.  
My ol der  si s t er wa s  ve ry
 br ight and my younger  
sister  too.  She i s now i n  the  Je wish
 home .  I 'll  te ll you l a
ter.  So from there th
e n my si ster ma rried 
the doct or and after school I  was a secret ary for  my 
fa ther  Olov has hal om " ma y he  rest i n peac e"  
and because we had 2 apart ment  hous
es in Pola nd ever ybody had to 
be  regi stere d sp
ecial books and  
if someone came fr om other country
, how many papers had 
to be filled out
 so I helped my father, 
you know, ti ll I  met  my hus ba nd.  
We had for a while a business like
 electric bulbs and like whe n  
you build apartment houses all thos
e, you know, pipes, ev
erything, we had for th
is for about, till the 
end of l938.  Until 
I me t my  lat e  hu sb and .  He  ca me  ar ou
nd t o our  busi ne ss a nd I  was  ther e and I  
used to know his uncle. 
 His uncle used t o have 
a busine ss for dent ists and 
tec hnic i ans.  Ever yt hing 
they brought fr om Germ
any, you know to bring, b
eca use  wa s t he  best  fr om
 Ger many.  And my  
father sent me  to business
 s o met hing to pa y.  In Po
land there were no checks,

Can you describe a 
little bit how Lodz, ho
w it looked there?
 
 
Lo dz, it wa sn't as though like trees 
and thi s, ye ah we ha d parks but 
ever y summer we used t o go t o  
the c ountr y, not far, and we  were 
the r e in l939, t he me n use d  to 
come  on Fri da y a ft er noon, like I  
read about here from Ne w 
Yor k, and st ay until  Sunday.  M y  hus ba
nd c a me  t o  pi ck up our  thi ngs, I 
still lived with my parents for th
e summer, they gave 
me a beautiful apartment in our apartment 
house.  In l938 they sent fr om 
Ger many, Hitler, Polish Jews, who 
were not citizens 
of Germany, I 
just read about too, so l7,000 
came  back and one family came , 
young pe opl e fr om Ger m any, rent ed 
an apart ment  house in ou

ed to go to Switzer
land and smuggle

had s o me mone y and t he J e ws  in 
Pola nd who helped hi m a l ot, my 
pare nts  -  my fat her  wa s  very activ
e Zionist, they opened even a 
clinic, you know.  My brother-in-

law was the main doctor, a fe w 
doctors , a dent ist s o for  a  $l .5
0 t hey coul d get  a  doctor  a nd 
presc ripti ons .  They ha d s mall  
stores you know, they not so po
or and one time , one time fr om 
Germany, Berlin, he came 
outsi de on the street  and ca me r unni
ng up, I  thi n k they 
ha d one c hil d, and 
said the Gestapo was looking for 
my  father, Ol ov hashalom.  We  
ha d t w o e ntra nces , so he ca me  
fr o m t h e b a c k  an d my  fa t h er ra n t o  t h e fi ft h fl oor
, the  4t h fl oor had, you know, t he water pi pe s; I  
wa s only with my mother .  I thin
k my  sister s a nd my br other we nt
 to a smaller town.  You know, 
the Gestapo came every da

 the y wante d.  My l ate fathe r ha d his  own 
study a nd t h ere was a bi g de sk a
nd t hey we nt a n d looke d a nd looked
 and didn't t ell us  what a nd we  
had a  big sa fe  and the y  t old my

said t he next  day, my fat her wo
uld have t o co me to the  Gesta po 
s o you ca n i magin
e what we went  
through.
 
 
Before we get into that, 
can we back up j ust  a lit
tle bit.  Were 
you involved also
 in t he Zi oni s t  
orga niza tion?
 
 
Not so mu ch, no.
 
 
Did you have any othe
r i nterests, sports?
 
 
In sc hool  yes, we  had 
a gym, thi s  was  a  pri v ate  Je wis h  
school.  We  had 
a horse, but I was 
______[l 04].  I sa w my grands on, 
how he jump ed, he could go up, 
he was 7 ye ars  ol d; we ha d a  
gym,  then we had arrhythmic [ph]
 [l 07] dances wit h a teacher play
ing the piano, you know, and in 
the summer  we could pl ay basket
bal l , outsi de we ha d a  s pe cial place  a nd it  was  l/ 2 bl oc k fr om

, my younge r sist er wa s  
onl y l3 year s  old. Can you i magine 
what we we nt through until  my 
fat her ca me bac k.  The Ger mans 
told us to gi ve bac k all our ra dios, we  could hear
 from Russia , fr om Buda pest
, we had t o gi ve t he m;  
I don't think the Poles ga
ve  them away becaus e wh en I ran aw
ay fr om Warsaw we used t o know 
what 's goi ng from the Pol e
s - we didn't know nothing.
 
 
Wh at language did you speak at home?
 
 
Mostl y Polish.
 
 

Not  Yid dis h ?
 
 
No, I didn't  know much Yiddis h but  
after the war in the camp Lithuain
a Jews eating 
in the kitchen 
getting the  food beca us e  we  di dn't have  nothi ng, th
ey heard us speaki ng Poli
sh they said no, only 
Yiddish.  But in Mi

my husba nd (not  my fir st

Al mo st l9 39 .
 
 
Do  you reme mb er when
 t he Ge r mans inva de d?
 
 
Oh, sur e.  Li ke I  sa id, my
 two sist ers a nd my br othe
r we nt out  i n t he city, I  
had an apartment in our 
apart ment  house, we heard on t he 
r adio, at  that  ti me  we  had a  ra di
o, t hat  the Ger mans ar e on t h e 
wa y t o our  c ity beca us e we  had so
 many Ger mans in fact
ories, the Germans ha
d fa ctorie s, so m y  
mother  sent  me  a nd my young
er  sist er t o  a st ore to buy what ever  
we  ca n buy;  not  to a  Je wish stor e  
beca use  we know everyt hing is sol d out so we ha
d hal f a  bl ock we cr os sed t o a  Poli sh st ore  w e  
heard conversation,  the Poles,  and 
we  were  sta ndi ng in 
line, it was so close 
to where we lived, a 
wo me n with dark hair we aring big cro
ss t he Polish wome n sa
id to her, "you
 
get out" and she was we ar
ing a cross and they didn
't touch my sister and 
not  me  a n d  we  were  s o  
close leaving but we came to th
e s t ore  and not  muc h wa s le ft.
 
 
Wa s this because you 
had Aryan features?
 
 

Ye s, be cause  my sist er, she was t a
ll, blond and bl ue eye s and we  we
re so close and this wome n said 
I am not Jewish and they wo uldn'
t let her stay and thro
w he r out and whe n t he Ger mans ca me the y  
were not far fr om us, some Jews 
they hung them and wh
o woul d go ther e to l o
ok at it, you know. 
An d then, when my  father
 went  to the Ge stapo
 
they ha d st at ues of t he or gani zation,
 so my late father sent me to 
the lawyer in a 
nice nei ghbor hood -  
I wal ke d when t wo Ger ma ns  grabbe d me , t his  was  
already cold, maybe Nove
mb er, l939, to go to 
work.  I  was weari ng a fur coat but  
i n fact  I  was wearing a rai n coat  
ove r i t  a nd t ook me t o a  sc hool  
for Ger mans  the y  br ought from t he 
Russia n  par t of Pola nd to c lean
 for  t he m. The Russ ians  br ought  
us some  brea d a nd I star
te d t o cl ean a n d t hen I went  to one of t he
 
Germans, a civilian, and I 
said "listen, (in Germa n) 
I have a little baby home,
 please let me go, let 
me  go."   But  my younger
 
sister, she was still 
l0 years, she was gr
abbed, she had to sign she woul
d come every day to clean the 
apart ments for t he Ger mans.  But t h
en t hey went  away.  And t hen my
 pa re nts, my la
t e father-i n-law 
wa s in busi ness with hi s br other,
 they s ol d mer cha ndis e for  de ntists , he  was arrest e d, t he  ol der  
brot her .  The y ca me  t o t h e  st ore;
 it wasn't a store, it 
was in an apartment they
 had the business, they 
asked the maid, the Polish ma
i d " where are t he t epia".  Tepia ar e ca
rpets, rugs.  So she sent them to 
us, to my fat her bec aus e she  know
s  t hat he l ive s wit h us bec a use  he  run a wa y a nd the y ca me, t wo 
military men, we ha
d two doors on both sides, 
locked so no one would ru
n away and they slapped  
my  father-in-law until we 
knew what t hey wanted.  
I showed them where t h ey
 
lived.  They lived on t he second fl
oor and I said "come, I 
show you we  don't have
 the tepia, the rugs, 
the car pets because we'r e 
going away".  You 
know, we had t o duck, you 
know, in case t here were  
no rights , a n d I  gr abbed t he sol dier , I  don't  know
 ma ybe he  was Ge sta po, and I  sai d se e I ' m te lling 
you t he  trut h in Ger ma n.  
I thought now he will hit 
me in the face wh
at  I di d, I gra bbe d hi m, but he 
belie ved hi m beca use  we  had t he  s uit
case.  I  said, we
 need the car pets?  Go to the maid, she took 
them."  So my father was respon
sibl e for my fat her-i n-law he woul
dn't run away.  So
 we  ra n  a w ay .  
Because every day, like 
I  say, t he Ger mans came t o us becaus
e the owners of th
e apartment house 
and we had a picture maybe
 of the grandfather, 
the little boy and the Rabbi
 asking questions and 
they looked and looke d a
nd we le ft  e veryt hing.  We  had a t y pe
writer, I reme mber 
my father put it 
on t he  5t h floor  be cause  we t hought  the  war w
oul d go onl y 6 months.  Beca us e my pare nt s  
re me mb er t h e Ger ma ns  fro m WWI .   
It was all  di ffer ent , t he Ger man
s, wer e ni ce to 
the Jews, were  
fri endly, but  we  
ha d to run a wa y.
 
 
Do  you reme mb er what mo nth th
at  wa s a nd whe r e di d you go?
 
 
To Warsaw.  
 
 
Wa s t his  in t he Fall  of l 9 39?
 
 

Ye s, in the end of this and in th
e border we had to show
 the m - we couldn't  go, we c oul d go only by  
bus , we had to go i n our ci ty
 bus and the busses we
re  there goi ng to Wars a w a n d we  took  
somethings with us and my late 
fir st hus ba nd he  did ma nufac turing 
of ma chinery but we  didn't take 
it.  I di dn't know we coul d writ
e let ter s and my fat her-i n-law knew
, he came later to Warsaw then 
we a nd he brought t his a nd t h
ey bee n looki ng a n d everybody ha
d ma chi n es and you know the y  
nee ded this , fr om c otton ma de; t he y used li ve be fo
re the war, WWI , i n t he 
sa me buil ding.  Whe n we  
came t o War saw, we wer e weari ng
 
whi t e -  no we  were we aring golatt a s, here  and he
re , i n Wa r s a w, t he  Je ws 
saw it and they tore off 
fr om us.
 
The yellow star?
 
 
Ye s, the  yell ow star .  Be caus e in
 Wa rsaw, t hey wore ar
mbands, the Moge n Duvi
d, but  not  in Lodz  
because this wa s a Ge rman - they  called Vitman
stac k {ph} {l43}, they ch
a nge d t he na me .  This  
was a Ger man city because so ma
ny Germans lived in th
is.  So we stayed 
a fe w da ys  with my 
fat her 's  a unt , used t o be  very we
althy in a beautiful neig
hbor hood, but  at  that  
time still wasn't  the 
ghett o.  Another c ousin c a me too 
wit h the c hildr e n, you 
know, ra n a wa y fr om Lodz, so we  had t o  
look for an apart ment. 
 We c oul d get a  room, for
 
4 people . Be caus e t he n t h
e Ger mans took ever ybody 
fr om the small towns they
 se nt  to Lodz  and to 
some cl ose t o Warsaw b
ecause it  was easier 
then to send t o Treblinka, 
you know.  And it  was so 
bad.  My father-in-law,  he didn't 
look like a Jew, like 
a Polish aristocrat .  An
d t hat ti me no ghetto, 
he was making busine
ss with Polish co
mpanies so he was selling to 
the dentists and technicians  
wh at he thought he could buy 
some food and there was nothi ng 
t o buy.  Yes, 
the Poles been 
showi ng i n t he str eetc ars who is  a J ew; never touc
hed hi m.  You know, he  
was tall, with moustache 
so he  didn't  l ook li ke  a  Je w so he  use d t o  bri ng 
food there.  I  r e member 
something from Russia he 
brought, oli ves , but  I  c oul dn't  eat
 it.  The Russi an Je ws, they liked
 them, green olives.  My late 
hus ba nd he spoke wit h t he m Russia n .  He didn'
t  know Yiddis h. ___________
__{l 66}.  Whe n one  
broke out , t h ey we nt ba c k t o Ru
ssia.  Why?   Because my late 
father-in-la w ha d mone y i n a  bank 
and they came after the war in l970 and lived for 
a while in the same  apartment house  later lived 
there and then they 
moved to Lodz because to ge
t at  the busi ness.  So it
 was i n November, I  don't 
re me mber t h e date , we de cide d t o  go t o Warsa w . 
 And the n  my fat her-i n-la w ca me  t oo and 4 pe opl e  
lived in one room.
 
 
So, what was it like in 
Warsaw and were you there when they
 started putting up
 the ghetto?   
 
                          
             
 
Ye s.  Was so bad.  One time , befo
re the Ghett o  was closed and t his
 was t h e ghett o  where we li ved. 
On e time  wa s no ghetto, a gypsy  
ca me  up, we were st anding in th
e kitche n, she  took my hand a nd 
said Jacob is thinking ab
out  you -  she could s ay other  Je wis h  na
me  -  c an you i magi ne .  So I  wa s  hi s  
____________{l76}, I  us ed t o
 work wit h hi m, you know wa s secret
ary.  So t hen, we decide d t o  get  
out .  It was so bad, we didn't wa nt t o lea ve t h
e m, you know, but for one 
thi ng we  coul dn't st a y 

anymore and then it was still not gh
etto in the smaller towns.  
My brother-in-law the doctor ran  
away with his wife  
and two children, two sons 
li ke  I sai d one is  t he  br ai n sur geon a nd one  is  a n  
archit ect.  And so we f
ound a wo man, dressed like 
a peasant, a Je wish women, and she said she ha s 
papers and s howe d us  somet hing 
and we  ha d to pa y her.  We 
went and t he ghetto was cl osed
 
 
Thi s wa s j ust  you 
and your husband?
 
 
Ye s, me  and my husband and we 
went, a Polis h polic e ma n wa s sta ndi ng the r e we s aid we woul d 
give you mo ney, ope n the woode n was cl ose d, t h e 
ghetto.  She did, gave 
her mone y a nd I wa s the 
first to go out. This was 
May.  The first days of
 May, I don't reme mb er 
exactl y and I was t aki ng 
some  wi nter  cl othes  bec ause  I  kn
ew how will I ge
t this from Wa rsaw and 
a rucksack carrying on 
my  back and a Po lish you
ng man stays ther e and said
 "if you won't give me  
mone y, I ' m goi
ng to the  
Ger ma ns " .  " We  will  gi ve  
you money, bring duri ska"
 
this means horse drawn like  carriage.  I said ye s, 
we  gave him  money, we 
came to the train station 
and the women, th
e peasant, she
 
bought the tickets.  This was in the evening.  Jews
 a nd Poles  wer e not  all owe
d after 8 o'clock to be 
on t he str eet .  Did you hear    
about, a year before I went to 
see my par e nts fr om Wa rsa w.  Th e  
ghetto wasn't closed.  My 
late cousin was killed. 
 She was from Switzerland,

In the trai n, I wa s st andi ng - nowh

 I  know __________
{286}, only t he  J e ws  know
 German and the Germans 
who li ve d i n  Poland.  The Pole s wh
en they went to highschool, it 
was public but the Jews  couldn't 
go, seldom, so they 
took French so 
I didn't answer and we

and we didn't know wher

Polish and a cook, Jewi sh. 
 So I called out and my 
father came down, it wasn
't so  lat e a nd  s o we  
stayed there.  We  fo un d a room in some  place and 
not  long t h ey closed t he

said, they robbed him 
on the street, I don't

Tur ks a r e da rk and he wa s dar k a nd he ha d pa per s. So
 he use d t o bri ng but t h

they s ent  us  to t he  cit y
, I think it was l94l, to 
the city of ____
________{324}, my l ate  br other-i n-
law, the doctor, he wa s bo

t his  town where  my pa rents  were  t o o. 
My late husband became se mi-retired policeman be
cause  typhus  was  ter r i bl
e you know what was 
goi ng on i n t he summer but thi ngs got  better .  We
 lived in t he same pl ace 
where t he Ger mans t ook 
over  the  offi ces. Denti sts  ha d to mo

were t h e Jewish offi ces and we 
had t wo rooms .  And my younger si ster me ant i m e 
got ma rried and her husban
d, his mother and his 
niece, we  had two rooms, 8 people
 maybe.  And one  ti me
 the Germans came  to the Je wish offices 
and t he y bee n looki ng t o get the Je
ws to se nd out  from the 
cit y but we were hidi ng wit h s o me of the  
people .  The y thought  that thi s be
longed to the Jewi
sh offices and they didn't 
come to out 
apartment.  
Otherwise we wo uld be sent
 out and killed. So  we  sa
w them.  But  before, I w
ill tell you, my late 
husband, my  se
cond husband told me, he 
was my second cousin; his 
mo ther was spechenleh {ph} 
{346} a nd my mother s pec

  After  t he wa r, I  di d know
 hi m in Lodz but  not  s o 
much, he fo und me in the 
came;  someone told
 him that me and 
my sister were u
nder the British; he 
wa s  in a  sanitorium -  he  wa s  sic k
.  So he  t old me t hat i n Lodz
 t he y took out the young wome n,  
children to the outskirts of
 the town - they killed 
them, in Lodz.  But he co
uldn't do nothing and he 
wa s by hims elf in the sanitorium. 
 He  found me and we  got ma rried 
in l947 and my

Hebrew Academy.  I worked and I pa

years they take out the children 
fr om the Charles Smith School (I

O n e  wo ma n  tol d  me

It was 3-4 years of war,

They took me  to the

The British took me and 
they
 
wiped me and took me back

So we came he
