Per Anger 
January 19, 1995 
Questi on:  Ca n you tell us  what your
 full na me  was  at birt h, i f it 's
 di ffere nt, a nd wh
ere and when you 
wer e  bor n?  
An s wer:  We ll, I  was  b orn  
on t he 7th of December  
1913 in Göte bor g on the  we
st coast of Sweden.   
Q: And your name  
wa s P e r An ger  the n?  
A: No.  Per Anger , I got  other 
na me s , whic h I ha d ne ver me ntione
d, bec a use t hat wa s  my mot her 
wa nte d that I should have na me d a fte r our ol d rela tiv
es .  So my na me i s Pe r Johann Val entine (ph) .  
I ne ver  me nt ione d t hose other  na mes  beca us
e I don't think they
 are  ve ry pre tty. 
Q: Do you e ver use  t he m? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Mr . Ange r, in 1941, y
ou wer e  se nt  to Berli n.  
Yo u wer e  a me mb er
 of t he foreign service at thi s  
poi nt. 

A: 1940. 

Q: 1940.  Ca n you tell  us what t hat  
wa s lik e?   Yo u wer e  
a  very young ma n. 
A: Thi s  wa s my  first  p ost .  I ha
d a ppli ed -- see , I had a ppli ed f or 
the foreign ser vice alr eady earl ier,  
but I wa sn't r eady with my
 exa m.  And at Upps
al a, I studied l a w, and in 
the meantime I 
wa s dra f ted;  
I was in the military service.  So 
I had difficulty in fini
shing this, but I just 
finished in time in 
Dec e mber 1939, whe n t he war  br okeout bet wee n Finl and a n d the Soviet
s at that time.  A dramatic 
period.  And the war ha d already start ed.  And th
e begi nni ng of  Worl d War II had alrea d y starte d, of  
cour se.  So t he Swedi sh For eign Offi ce knowi ng that
 I wa s a ppl ying for enteri ng t he servi ce, t he y  
said, " Look, here .  We  ha ve -- we 
need staff now.  So  we 
c oul d pres ent you as a 
tr ainee t o Berli n in  
January."  And so I just got out of the military service, 
and I just happened to 
finish my law exam.  
So I  was se nt in Ja nuar y 1940 to
 Berlin to help at the co mmer
cial depart ment in t he Swedi sh  
Emba ss y.  So I was  wor king there 
t h e whol e s pri ng a nd went  home  the n i n June , the s a me year, to  

appl y and to go through the exa m 
for the forei gn servi ce.  And I 
ma naged to get through that and 
returned then to Berlin where I 
stayed on till summ
er '41.  And I returned 
to Stockholm 
exactly the

day when Ger many inva ded, so in J une ,  mi dsum
mer '41.  So fr om t her e on, I sta ye d on anot her  
year in Stoc khol m.  But 
in Ber lin, it wa s, of c our se, for me , 
for a Swe de never ha ving been out in 
war and all that, it was quite
 a new situation, all that
.  And it wa sn't so mu ch
 all of the bombing and 
fi ghti ng, t hat  didn't  ha ppen t hen bec a use all over
 Eur ope was then slowl y being domi nated by the  
Ger ma ns .  Not duri ng t he  spring, but as you re me
mber, i n Apr il they inva ded Nor wa y, De nmar k in 
a bi g oper ati on whe n the y took over  
a ll of Europe.  So duri n
g this fi rst half-year 
when I was there, it 
was very, very little of 
wars, things which remi
nds me of the war.  
There were some British 
airpla nes c o mi ng i n now and then a n d dropped s o me
 bombs on Be rlin.  And 
so we had to go around 
in the shelters and so on. 
 But  it was , of course , har d to get food
 and it was  a l so a  ver y s e vere wi nter  
that 1940 a n d so on.  So it wa s in a wa y the n ki nd 
of a hardship for all t he 
pe ople in Berli n, all of  
the m.  But it wa s not destr oye d and 
not  -- those bombs di dn't
 c ause very much da
mage really.  But it 
wa s a ps yc hological t hing, whi ch is 
very int erest ing.  Ther e ca me one Bri t i sh air pla ne i n during the  
night, say, at mi dnight an
d forced the whole 
population down in the shelte
rs.  And then Hitler was, 
of course , furious t hat th
e Air Force coul dn't st op these peopl e
 coming in.  And s o eve rybody wa s  
sitting there in the shelters
.  And then after an hour,
 they went up again to 
continue to 
sleep.  And 
then a fter  t w o more hour s, a nothe
r  air plane ca me from Britai n and 
start ed t o dr op s o me  bombs  and 
force d the whole popul ation aga i n 
down in the shelters.  So th
at was a kind of psyc hol ogic al  
war f are , in a  wa y,  whic h  wa s v e ry 
frustrating for the peop
le in Berlin.  Then they st ar ted to know 
that now something is coming here
, and t his is only t he begi nni ng
, whic h was t he fa ct.  But the n , 
you see , slowly t he Ger ma ns took over, a nd I wa s ther
e -- I was ther e in April whe n we  sent the fi rst  
-- I thi nk i t  was end of March, we 
sent t he fir st dispatch or t he c
ode  tele gra m t o Swe den about t h e 
German planning.  That
 was very -- I was there sitting in
 my room on a Sunday when the y  
telephoned from the e mbassy.  " Now, you ha ve to 
come here because you 
a r e on dut y, a nd you ha ve  
to se nd a c o de tel egra m t o Swede n, 
a cipher."  So I came t here and 
I remember still 
that wa s one of 
the mo re dramatic periods of my  li
fe at that time.  I was waiting for that telegram to come, and my  
boss sai d, " Now, in a fe w minute s 
you will ge t the most terri ble mess
age you ever have met t o sen d  
to Sweden."  And t hat was the infor mati on we
 had got through the un
der ground, __________ a nd

Ka naris ( ph)  and those peopl e in 
Ger ma ny who wer e  worki n g agai ns
t Hit l er.  And we  got thr ough 
them t he whole plan that  in a 
fe w da ys, the y a r e goi ng t o i nvade
 De nmar k, Nor way - -  we di dn't  
know about  Swe den, i f the y were  
goi ng t o t ouch Sweden.  And that
's  part of a  bi gger  pla n t o  
conquer the whole of Europe , in
cludi ng Britai n, whi ch t he y neve
r succeeded.  Bu
t the whole of 
Fra nce , Bel gium, Poland and s o on
.  So I got that in, and I star
ted to put it into this mappin g  
machi ne.  It was at that t i me a 
very awkward machine, a modern 
thi ng.  And I mana ged t o get it 
through a nd I went t o t he post  offi c e and mail e d th
a t to St ockhol m, and then I c oul dn't sle ep, of 
cour se.  M y god, pe rha ps  I had made
 the wrong sort of -- pus he d th
e wrong butt on or whatever .  So  
what happens -- what could happ
en now in Stockholm 
is that the Germans 
will invade Sweden 
tomorr ow; a nd the y wil l  not be war ne d in Swe den 
because the r e was a sl oppy s ort of a ttache at the  
e mbas sy who couldn't ci pher ,
 wh o couldn't send the ri
ght telegram to Sweden. 
 That wil l be you c an 
read it i n all the hi stor y books a bou
t t his ma n.  I t  wa s a ni ght mar e  I 
had.  And, of c our se, t hey coul d, 
and t hat is t h e intere sting reacti on t hen in Swe de n
 - -  ﬁ We thi nk you ha ve be en ne rvous i n Berlin.  I  
me an, we c a n 't  unders tand 
why you s ort of exaggerate t hings l ike
 t hat.ﬂ And the y didn't  belie ve us . 
And the n, not till a coupl e of days be
fore, I would say five days befo
re t he inva sion, we send a ne w 
cable .  And then the y underst ood that  
now, it 's ser i ous .  Now, it 's s eri
ous, but t hat was rather l ater .  
You know, we were not prep
ared at a ll to de fe nd our c ountr y.  A
nd Hitl er apparent ly t h ought t hat it  
wasn't necessary to 
invade Sweden because
 he could al ways do
 that l ater on.  
Sweden was al ways  
there, and we were delivering iron 
or e to hi m.  And he was happy w
ith t h at, a nd s o on.  So gr ante d, 
they conquer e d Nor wa y, De nmar k, a n d 
the othe r c ountries .  So I was 
t he n i n that situa t i on.  Then, 
we were in administrati
on, we were sitting in th
e embassy and didn't know
 fr om one day or the 
other i f t he Ger ma ns we re goi ng t o i nclude Sweden 
also in the attack towa
rds Sca ndi navia .  And 
then I also r e member another episode whi ch I ve
ry muc h re me mb er is wh
en the br igade or the  
ar my, what ever you call  i t , ret urn
ed fr om France mar chi ng thr ough t h
e streets of Berli n and how the 
people gre et ed t he m and thr owing fl owers towar d
s t he sol die rs a nd thi nki ng t hat  now, the  war i s  
over .  And the war had j ust sta r ted, you know, 
which t he y couldn't unders tand t hat .  The war had  
just st arte d.  And t hey marche d, 
the se  troops ma rc hed up and l i ned 
up outs ide the bi g palace .  The  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

Villa Platt (ph) was the name, a
nd out on the balcony came
 Hitler.  And he wa
s greeted then by the 
ma sse s sa ying "Heil, Hitl er" and all of that.  I wa
s standing the r e and ever yb
ody did t his , that sal ute , 
so I thought I better do th
at.  Otherwise, I don't -- but I had 
forgotten one thing. 
 I had still my hat  
on, a nd t he n a man right behi nd me 
gave me  a blow li ke t hat s o my
 hat  fle w a way, I don't how long, 
beca use you shouldn't st and fa cing the Führe r  with
 a hat on.  So that was that atmo sphere, you 
know, of s or t  of he had more or
 less hypnotized the 
whole population.  He 
was the -- I mean, the 
savi or, t he Führer and all  that.  So
 that gave me the fi rst impression
; I saw how terribly this syste m 
had infiltrated in the whol
e population.  And th
en after that came also th
e persecutions of the -- the 
Je wish perse cutions  and a
ll that and so on.  One di
dn't noti ce s o much of it
 in Berlin because they  
did i t in a very clever, secret 
way.  But I remember that I had 
a house ke eper , a  Je wi sh la dy, who 
came t o -- I  was a bachel or at t he 
t i me -- to clean up my apart ment.  
All of a s udden, or  one  da y, she 
didn't come .  Sh e just disappeared
.  So t he y di sa ppe ared, j ust  lik
e t hat, a nd wer e br ought to t he  
exter mi nati o n camps or  whatever.  
Only at that time, it 
wa s n 't ver y  mu c h  k n
own in the world, I 
wo uld say. 
Q: We re you getting reports abou
t what was happening 
in Germany and then 
what was happenin g 
outsi de  in ter ms  of t he per secuti on . . . 

A: Ya. 

Q: . . . not j u st the wa r?  

A: Ye s, we didn't ver y much, s ay,
 in 1940.  We  didn't 
know very about it then
 -- or '41, I di dn't 
know other t han there was discr i minations agai ns t th
e Je wis h people and s o on.  But t he first real  
repor t we se nt -- I wa sn't  there t he n, I  wa s the n i n 
Buda pest - -  wa s se nt in 
'42.  You see , ther e was  
the big conf erence in Wannsee i n 
t h e be ginning of '42, when the 
fi nal sol ution was de cide d upon. 
And then towards the end of that year, the wo
r l d starte d to know abou
t it.  I know that the 
Ameri cans knew about it;  also, the Swedish.  The 
Ameri can governme nt kne
w about it, the Swedish 
governme nt and all t hat; beca use we had a dipl omat
 a t  the Berlin E mba ss y, a good fri end of mine , 
who on a tra i n in, s ay, October '42 
met an SS offi cer who came up and 
said, "I have to tell you.  I 
can't st and it  any longer
."  And he told him th
e whole story about t he ga
s cha mbe rs. And t hat we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
5 
 
reported home to Sweden in '4 2.  
So, for sure, fr om the 
autumn of '42, the Sw
edish governme nt and 
the Americans got the 
sa me  re port , a nd the  Swiss  and all.  From
 that on, most of 
the governments in 
the we ster n wo rld  kn e w wh at wa s go
ing on.  I t hi nk t hat  is  i m porta
nt t o sa y beca use  to -- knowing 
how little they did, or
 they did nothing.   
Q: Did you know about
 the euthanasia k
illings in Germany? 
A: About the what?  
Q: About the euthanasia, when 
they were doing so-called merc
y killings in Ge
rmany in the  
hospitals, in the me
nta l hospit als?  
A: I  di dn't know at  tha t  ti me .  I  thi nk we got  to kn
ow about  tha t  later .  I di
dn't know anythi
ng then at 
that t i me, no. 

Q: When you said you were in 
this situation watchi
ng the Führ er and wat ching e verybody res pond  
to him and you al
most raised your hand in 
a "Heil, Hitler," but, fortunat
ely, you were 
stopped, what  
wer e  you thi nki ng?   Wer e  you frig
hte ned a nd t hought you would ha ve
 to do it beca use s o mebody . .  
. 

A: Why, they would have killed 
me. Oh absolutely. Ther
e saying such -- what 
do I say -- excited,  
what you ca ll, hypnoti ca l  (sic) si
t uati on.  They were spellbound.
  They were spellbound by t hi s  
man.  So if you said anyt
hing against him or if yo
u did anything to 
him, you would ha
ve been kille d 
on the  s pot  by t he ma ss  of
 pe opl e, by t he crowd. 
Q: Whe n you met  or dinary Ge r man
s during t his  peri od, did the y 
--  wer e they hypnotize d e v e n  
outsi de  of that sit uati on wh
en there wer e cr owds?   
A: Well , the y -- not  hypnotiz ed, but
 they were all indoct
ri nat ed i n a  fant astic way.  I  mean, t his  
Goebbels must have been abso
lut e, re ma rka b le pr ofes sional i n the wa y of spr eadi ng t his  
infor ma tion or indoctrina ting pe ople .
  I magi ne, at that ti me there 
was no t el evisi on. The r e was j ust  
the spoken word.  There was the 
radi o, of cours e, and t he ne wspa pe
rs , but that was enough.  I wa s  
living at that time 
at t he pension, where I  was sit ting arou
nd the table with 
the Germa ns and old 
people and how t he da y a fter t he i n vasi on of No
r way and Denmar k were 
so happy.  They said, 
"Look, are n 't  you happy? "  Looked at  me , " Why? "
  "Beca use we have s aved, we have save d your  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

neighbors fr om being invaded by 
the allies, by the British.  And now, they are going to be free  
people, and, of course, under our 
c ontrol.  Anyhow, we ha ve save d 
them from this imperialist sort 
of we ster n powers ."  Thi s whole atti t ude was so 
all over .  There were no excepti ons from t hat  
theor y.  And, of cour se , it was  pa rt
 of it and so fort
h that they were also pe
rhaps -- even i f t hey 
thought that it was ab
solutely the wrong, the right
 ver sion of i t , they were
 scared to say something 
agai nst it .  Because t hen t hey kn
ew what was goi ng to 
happen.  So ever ybody 
was --  I mean, even 
the offi cials in the forei g n ser vi
ce wi th whom I had to deal , t hey 
wer e all  the same.  They never  
doubte d.  When you c a m e up to the 
foreign office , I was deali n g wit h
 the commer cial thi ngs, al ways 
the same salute.  "Heil, 
Hitler," like that, 
you know.  I never sa
id, "Heil, Hitler."  
Never in my life . 
So  th at wa s 
t he wa y of gr eeting peopl e. 
Q: What sor t  of a n i mpr ession -- you wer e a ve
r y young per son a nd cer t ainly had not experi enc e d 
this kind of for m of gove rnment , t h
is kind of oppression.  Wh at eff
ect  di d t his have on you in your  
mi d 20s , late  20s?  

A: We ll, that's -- of cour
se, it was ve ry stra nge for me  to e nc o
unter such a  syst e m.  Of cour se , i t  
was, but that  is also ver y danger ous because wit
hout knowing if your sel f, you get i ndoctrinated.  I f 

you e ver y day hea r  the sa me thi ng in radi o, rea d 
the sa me thing in the  paper , hea r ing pe ople  
spea king about  the  sa me  thi ng, a bout  how vi ctori
ous  we are a nd how we ar
e goi ng to conquer t he  
whole  worl d, a nd all t hat  and s o on
, a nd Hitl er i s a fa ntasti c man.  
He  ha s give n us j obs and all t hat  
and so on.  So I someti me
s had the i mpression that  I have t o go
 to Sweden now fo
r some vacati on to 
breat he, to li sten to ot her opi nions 
than this.  I mean, th
i s is  re mar ka ble how you can get influe nce d  
without knowing it yourself. 

Q: Di d you s ee a ny perse cution of anybod
y?   Be ati ngs  in the str eet or . . . 
A: No. 

Q: Nothing? 

A: No, I  di dn't  see  a nyt hi ng like  that.   

Q: How did i t ha ppen 
that  you were  se nt t o Buda pe st in 1942?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
7 
 
A: We ll, it s o ha ppene d beca use  I 
was then off to Berlin dealing with the Hungarian affairs in the 
forei gn offi ce with the commer cial
 ma tters, a nd the r e were
 dele gations fro m  Bu
dape st comi ng.  And 
we  were ne gotiati ng wit h  the m, a nd we sa w t hat  Hung
ary is a potential sort 
of delivery of our goods 
we need.  Foodstuffs, and all th
at.  Hungary was and still is an 
agricultural countr
y, you know, s o  
then they wanted to
 se nd some one  who al
r eady got  some  e xperi
ence  in these  ne goti ations .  So I  was  
sent t o Buda pest ma inl y beca use 
t hey needed someone fo
r this job.  So I was participating in the 
negotiations there.  The Sw
edish delegation comi ng out,
 I wa s a me mb er o f  that
.  And we trie d to --  
you know, t hat old s yste m of ne gotia tions a bout trade tha t  if we gi ve you some steel , you give us  
some  apple s.     

Q: Bartering? 

A: Bargaining like that.  Bilatera
l sort of trade which 
doesn't exist any longer
 happily enough.  So 
that was my job fr om 1942 when 
I came in November '42 
to Budapest onwards 
till, say, till '43, '44. 
Be ginning of '4 4 and s o on whe n 
it wa sn't  ver y mu ch -- you di dn't not
i ce ver y much of the war then  
in Budapest at that time even 
if Hungary was an ally
 to Ger m any, you know
.  But t he  Hungaria ns, 
first of all, they didn't lik
e  -- of c our se, nobody like s war, but t h ey
 were forced i nto 
this war.  And it 
wa s also per haps rather e asy for 
the Ger mans to force th
e m t o get int o the war on their side beca use  
this all goes back to the 
fir st worl d war , you know.  The i nj us
tice of the first wo
rl d war , whic h I 
think after the second world war,
 people had -- the western powers 
and le a rned muc h more how to 
treat those who ha ve defeate d.  
That after the first world war, 
they decided to more or less  
exter mi nate  Ger ma n y, or  the y -- Ger ma ny, t hey put
 on the  s houlder s of Ger ma n y those enor mous 
debts in all the war.  And they 
on t he ma p s ort  of dr e w up ne w li nes , l i nes for ne w states  like  
Cze chosl ova kia, Yugosl a via, and s o 
on.  And they cut off then arti
ficial bor ders , but  they di dn't  
think of t hat now, we are placi ng 
a great mi nority of people on the 
ot her c ountries , 
within the other  
countrie s ' borders .  So Hungary, 
they took away from Hungar y two- thirds of their territory after the 

first world war and gave it to the 
neighbors.  So that was still -- th
at was always in
 the mind of the  
Hungaria ns, this feeli ng of reve nge.
  We ha ve to get ba ck our  terr
itor y.  And, of cours e, whe n the y  
joined Germany in the second worl
d war , that wa s their hope and t hat goe s bac k, e ver ythi ng, whic h 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

doe sn't pre v ent hist ory t o ta ke  it a w a y a gai n a ft er  th
e second world war.  So 
that's  how it we nt, you 
know, with t hos e countri es.  So th
at wa s ver y sa d that peopl e who 
di dn't  understa nd the hi stor y of  
Europe and all that, the 
statesmen at  that ti me, 
I think they caused very 
much all the reasons for 
ever ythi ng for the se cond world war .   All the faul
t which was ma de during af
ter t he first worl d war, 
more or  les s, ca use d t he s
econd worl d war , I  think. 
Q: What wa s your dail y 
life like in Budapest during those 
two years before the occupation by 
Ger ma n y i n '42 and '43?  
A: Well, it wa s, as I told you, it was going on as 
usual.  The  Hungaria ns had,
 of cours e, partic ipat e d  
in the war already, but th
ey lost their whole 
army in the battle 
on the east front at the beginning of 
1943.  And aft er t hat
, they said to themselves, 
" Ne ver , we ar e not  going t o be  acti ve a ny l onger i n  
this war."  So when th
e Germans -- and then
 during this period and when
 I was there, '42 till '44, 
when Ge r ma ny i nva de d, t he li fe went
 on more or l e ss a s  us ual .  We
 ha d our  trade ne goti ations with  

the m, and Buda pest l ooked rat her pe ace ful .  Th
e r e had bee n  no bombi ng 
to speak of from the 
Russians or fr om any of the enemi es.  And the 
Hungaria ns are pe opl e wh
o enjoy life , and I wa s  
sitting at the cafes there 
and listening to the Gypsy 
music and so on and so on
 as it always had been 
in Buda pest , this bea uti fu
l city.  And then this situat ion, of 
c our s e, completel y c ha nge d i n  Marc h '44 
when the Ger mans deci ded 
to invade Hungary 
because of t wo reasons.  
The first was t hat t hey 
wa nte d to force  the   Hungaria ns 
to fight now mo re actively on th
ese fronts against  the Sovi ets. 
And, sec ondly, t hat t hey have to s t art off als o with
 the fi nal solution, which th
ey ha dn't done .  Ther e  
was, of course, anti-
Semitic feelings in Hungary, 
as there had always been. 
 And also part of the 
expl anati on t hat is  als o pa rt of what ha ppe ne d a f
ter the first world war when
 -- you s ee, i n Hungar y 
to do bus ine ss wasn't -- a  gentle man c oul dn't do bu
siness .  Tha t  was t he Je wis h pe opl e who ha d th e  
business in their hand, they thou
ght.  They were sittin
g on their estates, y
ou know, and had their  
castles and t he upper class and all  th
at is one.  And they left all 
the business i n the  ha nds of t h e  
Je wish peopl e, and al so ma
ny Je wi sh pe opl e wer e  the n i n t hos e pr ofe ssions  as  doctor s, a s arc hite cts , 
and all those professions. 
 So whe n Hungary then lost t w o-t hir ds
 of that territory, 
all the -- or most 
of the Hungarians were sitting out on this land 
which was taken over by ne
ighboring countries.

They moved into Budapest to that 
center, and then they found t hat 
all pr ofessions more or less were  
take n by the  Je wis h pe ople i n B
uda pest .  And s o t hat, of c o urse , i ncre as ed t he  anti - Se miti cs i n  
Hungary.  But they never  came to t hat  extreme t hat
 they tri ed t o  exter mi nate the whole race in ter m s  
of to find a solution like 
t he Ger ma ns had.  So that led, of cours e
, to t he sit u ation t hat the  people, t he  
Je wish people in othe r countries i n Europe like i n
 Franc e and Pol and and Ger ma n y, i f they c oul d, 
they fl ed to Hungary because they 
said, "Well, look, there is a countr
y which is still is free."  It was 
in the paper it was indepe
ndent even if i t was a
llied to Germany, but th
ey kne w, e ver ybody kne w 
that the y ha dn't come t o a ny per sec uti ons in t hat bi g scale as all  that had bee n done in Ge r ma ny a nd 
Fra nce and Pol and and so on.  So
 t he popul ation in Hungar y incre ase d to 800,000 peopl e, livi ng 
600,000 i n t he countr y
si de and a bout  200,00
0 in Buda pest .   
Q: The Jews , you're
 talking about? 
A: Huh?  

Q: Je ws?  

A: J ews, Je wis h people.  Jews.  
An d so that was one of the purpos
es.  The second pur pose was t hen  
for the Ger m ans t o i nvade Hungar y t o for ce t hem no
w to bring the final solu
ti on t o Hungary.  Tha t  
wa s t he pur pose . 

Q: Had Jewish people's lives ch
anged very much during the pe
riod of the a
lliance with the 
Ger ma ns?  

A: Pa rdon?  

Q: Di d the  l i fe  o f t he J e ws cha ng e  v e ry mu ch du
ring t he peri od of ti me prior to the occupation?  
Were ther e laws like the Nurember
g La ws  for the lost professions?  
A: They had some  Jews -- discrimi
nated the Jewish people, of course
.  Th ey had, fo
r instance, there 
wer e quota s for so-and-s o many c oul d only st udy 
at the uni ve rsity a nd so on.  So the r e  had a l rea dy 
bee n -- t hose  la ws had alr eady been introduce d a ft e
r the first world war and 
s l owly i ncr ea sed and s o  
on.  But they were not sort of se
r ious r eally compar ed to what ha
ppene d the n in Ger many, but it was  
discri mi nati on.  Cert ainl y, it wa s. 

Q: Were  ther e ot her  gr oups who were  dis cri mi
nate d a gai nst dur i ng thi s period of ti me?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
10 
 
A: Well, no.  Really, it wa sn't.  
The  Gypsi es, for  insta nce , which t h
e Germans also sent to the gas 
chambers and so on.  Bu t 
in Hungary they were trea
ted l i ke -- t hey were fa
vored because 
they liked  
them.  They played in t he cafes 
a nd s o  on and s o on.  No, ther e  
was ma inl y the Je wi sh peopl e who  
wer e discr i mi nate d.  And all -- see , they didn't  
have these  probl e ms e ith
er with the mi norities 
because all t he people now wit hi n t heir bor ders 
were Hungarians.  Contra
ry t o toda y whe n bi g 
mi noriti es  ar e livi ng i n Sl ova kia , i n Ger mani a a nd so on. 

Q: Were  the re di scussi ons in the 
le gat i on or bet we en le gati ons about t he potential  for  more sever e  

perse cuti on i n Hungary a nd some  at
tempt to make prepara
tions for t hat pri or t o t he oc c upati on in 
March?  

A: No, not really.  It di
dn't ha ppen ver y much be fo
re the Ger mans came in. 
Q: So there wasn't 
a sense that the Germans will 
probably co me in, and if th
ey do, the s
ituation will 
get worse?  

A: Well , what we di scovered was , 
of cour se, was that ther e wer e so
me pe ople in the governme nt or  
in the depar t me nts , s o me  high-ra nki ng offi cials  w
ho we re ver y anti-Je wi s h, 
a nti- Se mit i c and s o on, 
whi ch then t hey ca me into power then when t he 
situati on had changed.  So we knew t here was a  
growi ng feel ing a mong t he m.  That, we kne w; but th
ey ha d no say be caus e it was, a ft e r all, Horthy 
was a strange man anyway.  
He wa s the He ad o f State , o f c ou r se
, and he li ke all  the se ma gnates , al l  
these upper class, t hey never  sor t 
of for perse cuti o n, but  they didn't 
-- they were sort of anti-Jewish 
in a way that  they didn't  a
ccept  them r eally in soci ety,
 i f I  may take that  as an
 exampl e and so on.  It  
didn't pr eve nt _______, for i nsta nc e, to have a  
fe w Jewi sh good friends with whom he played 
bridge a nd s o on.  I me an, it wa
s  kind of a  mi xture  of anti -Se miti
cs a n d a fte r all , having good  
fri ends als o a mong the J ewi
sh people.  It's a lot difficult to 
give you the exact 
de fi nit i on of how 
strong these fe elings against the Je
wish people were at that time.  
But t hen, of c our se, when all the 
Naz i  pe ople  in Hungary, when t he y  ca me int o power , or the pro- Ge r ma ns ca me i nt o powe r, but  

even so, the first govern
ment whi ch came int o power was ki nd 
of a --- Sztojay wa
s his name.  He 
wa s Amba ss ador to Berli n, a nd he was known as  
being very much pr o- Ge
r man, but t hey ma de  a  
di ffere nce .  And I  thi nk all of the m kind of

German and people who 
were Nazis in Sweden.  For instan
ce, t he ol d Swedi sh ge neration, you 
know, military people and bure
aucrats,  they admired very mu
c h the old Ger many for  their  
efficiency and all that and so on.  But  when they 
wer e  face d wit h this n e w sit uatio n wit h the Naz i s,  
of cour se, they wer e all agai nst 
it .  So I me an, 
I think this Ambassador to
 Berli n, Szt ojay, wa s a  
typic al pro- Ger ma n Hungaria n.  And he ca me int o 
power , and it 's typical 
then how we managed to 
negotiate with him, with 
t hat government a nd how they approve d
 those pas s ports  and all that a nd so  
on.  They di d.  I  mea n, 
they woul d ne ver ha ve done that i f 
they had been extr
eme Nazi peopl e. 
Q: Just t o go ba ck for  
a moment .  You wer e mar r ie
d i n 1943 in Buda pest?  
A: Yes .  In Buda pest .  We  wer e
 ma rried in St oc khol m, 
but we  ma de our  ho me i n Budapest shortl y 
aft er i n June 1943. 

Q: Can you explai
n a little bit your po
sition?  You were a 
second secretary in 
negotiation when yo u 
first came in '42?  

A: The att aché is perhaps the na me 
or secr etar y or whatever .  It 's 
t he sa me .  Today, we  don't  ha ve  
attachés;  we have secret aries.  
But we always called at
t achés because t hat wa
s the fi rst position we 
had a broa d.  And I was i n char ge of, as I told y
ou, about the tr ade business and comme rce and so 

on.  But, you se e, 
an e mbass y, a ver y s ma ll e mb assy like 
tha t , it wa s onl y the a mbas sador or you  
call it mi nister at that time b
eca use it was dele gation -- we cannot
 forget about that.  Say, the 
a mbas sa dor , mysel f  that is ne xt i n c o mma nd.  
We had a chancellor office. 
 We had the two girls  
who were typewriting, 
and we had a co
ach attaché and a driv
er.  That was all. 
Q: Se ve n pe ople?  

A: Ya,  tha t  wa s t he who l e sta ff.  
 Th en, what did we do?  Well, 
we had to safegu
ar d the Swedish 
interests, of course.  If there we
re Swedish citizens there, we have 
to protect them, 
and all the legal 
busi nes s for the Swe des , you know, a nd the tra de and 
s o on.  Infor ma tion about Swe den, the cult ure  
relations .  We  ha d s o ma ny cult ur al 
inter ests.  It wa s rat he r strang
e when I think of it that in the 
midst of the war we had so much 
of e xchange on t he cult ural si de.  We ha ve Swedi sh opera si nge r s  
who ca me .  Juss i Bj orling, for i nsta n ce.  He ca me 
to Buda pe st, was si ngi ng the r e in t he opera .  In 
1942, '43, those t wo year s, we ha
d ne arly every mont h we had so
meone comi ng fr om the Swedis h 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

Opera a nd al l that.  We had the Swe di sh language ta
ught at the  universit y a nd s o on and so on.  So 
the commercial and the cultural bu
siness and the political -- 
wasn't very much, of
 course.  We didn't  
have any exchange i n that
 fi eld very much.  Of c
ourse, we li stened to what
 they said because they 
were, after all, allied to
 Germans, so we reported
 home about that. 
 Some political di
spatches and so  
on.  That wa s all .  
Q: Were  you getti ng c onti nuous  di spa t ches  a b
out t h e war  and about  wh
at wa s happening . . . 
A: Pa rdon?  

Q: Were  you getti ng dispatche s a bout  the war i n Buda pest?  

A: Ya, well, . . . 

Q: What a bout t he . . . 

A: We  reported wh at happen
ed.  We  r eport ed about the 
defe at on the east fr on
t, t he Ger m an ar my or  
the Hungari an ar my and all t hat. 
 About the fe el ings  
about the first bombin
gs when the Russi ans 
droppe d a fe w bombs  on the  
cit y once, and the at mospher e and al
l that.  We were
 reporting about 
that. 

Q: Now, I al so mean wer e you ge
tting reports?   Wa s St ockhol m gi
vi ng you reports about what w a s 
happening outside? 

A: Oh, al wa ys, al ways.  We al ways r elaye d re port s 
like that between the embass
ies, you see.  So we 
wer e aware of what was 
happe ning, of cours e. 
Q: So explain wh at March 19th
, 1944 wa s like.  Where were 
you wh en the Ge
rmans came in? 
A: Well , t hat 's how I s t art  my 
book.  Whe n I was awa k
e in the morning on a 
Sunday morn
ing when 
the ambassador telephoned me an
d said, "You have to come to
 t he e mbass y now beca use  the 
Ger ma ns  are  on t he wa y to invade 
the city."  And so I 
sa w th e  Ger ma n tr o ops
 coming in with big  
tanks and artillery and ev
erything through the stre
ets and how people were 
scared and how people 
fel t  that now their i ndependence is at stake no
w and so on.  And above all, the Jewi sh pe opl e  
underst ood what wa s going t o happe n
 there.  That 's for 
sure , a nd t he end.  And t o onl y a fe w days  
aft er to see every t hird people on the street wearing 
a yellow star and all that 
made me sick.  I me an, 
how could one discri mi nate anot
her  race?  How could 
one doom --  I mean
, the doomsday for

Jewish people has co me.  How on 
earth is that possible to do all 
this?  Even if I had known a little 
bit about it in Ge
r ma n y, t o s ee it  now in full de ve
lopment, see, th
at was t erri ble. 
Q: How qui c kly di d peopl e have
 to put  on a  Je wi sh star?  
A: Oh, that came like th
at.  Rules were sort of 
issued imme di ately.  And 
i f you didn't  wea r it , you 
wer e  punis h ed.  And t he y ha d al
re ady, you see , t hey had alre ady 
infor mation, th
e Ge rmans about 
the -- now, this was about Budapest
.  I don't know about the coun
tryside so muc
h, but they ha d 
already infor mati on about 
the most prominent Jewish
 pe ople in Budapest .  So wit hout we c oul dn't  
do anythi ng beca use j ust the first da ys, the y just a
rreste d, sa y, a couple of hundre d Je wish pe opl e. 
Many of the m are best , good fri end
s , really, and the only -- this is
 really s t range -- the onl y fa mily  
who ma na ge d to get  out wa s the M anf
red-Vice (ph) famil y. 
 This wa s a  bi g indust
riali s t.  They had 
the big fact ories on Säffl e (ph).  
Säffle (ph) was an is
land on the Danube  bet we en Budapest, and 
they ma na ge d to negotiat e and t he y wer e ver y cl
ever .  And one of t he m, 
one of the famil y -- th e 
whole family was, with relatives
, about 120 people or some t hing 
like that.  But one of them was  
take n t o Vie nna  and t ort ured and 
all  that , but  he  mana ge d t o  say, 
" I  wa nt to ne goti at e."  And he 
kne w there were two that were -- there were Hi mm
le r on one si de a nd Goering on t he ot her side , 
who bot h wante d t o have the se fact ories .  So he
 made a deal with one 
of them.  I think it was 
Himmler, I think, who got 
it.  Because Himmle
r kne w that  i f he didn't  pl
a y hi s c ards, it would be  
take n all by t he Goering fa mi l y.  So
 he manage d t o ge t free  sort of 
tr aveli n g for  the whole fami ly t o  
Port ugal, pl us an a mount of mone y and all t hat . 
 So t hose people were  give n false  Port ugues e 
pass ports and were  all se nt to Port
uga l.  That 's the onl y e xa mpl e I know
 of how at that time.  At the 
very begi nni ng, people  mana ged to ge t out.   

Q: What happened at t he emba
s sy?   We re pe ople  i m mediatel y crowding ar ound the  e m bass y?  
A: Oh, ya.  The  foll owi ng days 
they wer e que ui ng up out side the 
ne utral  e mba ssie s.  The ne utral  
embassies at that time was the 
Swedish, the Swi ss, t he Por t uguese
 a nd t h e Spani sh, a nd al so t he  
Vati can had their  representat ion t h ere.  They 
were queuing up outside
 our e mba ssies  in bi g 
numbers, and it was ve
ry, very difficult to know what to do 
really.  And as I have written in my  
book a nd all  that , we tri e d to i mpr ovi se a nd we  tr ie
d t o find wa ys of bl uffi ng t he Na z i s.  And we  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

gave those  peopl e who had very cl
ose connections with Sweden, ma
rrie d t o Swedi sh l a dy per haps, 
or havi ng their rel ative s in Swed
en, or very, ver y  close tr ade rela
tions wit h Sweden
, we ga ve  the m  
Swedi sh provisional pas s ports .  A Swedis h pr ovi si ona
l pas spor t  is a doc u ment whi ch you, a s a r ule, 
can gi ve t o Swedi sh c iti zen or some one who s ays, 
"I a m Swedis h, but I have lost my pas sport." 
An d, "Oh, here, you can ha
ve a  pr ovi sional one .  Go 
to Sweden and veri fy yo
ur identity there, and  
you will get an ordinary pa
ssport."  Really, a travel
er's  docume nt, you see.  
And so I took on me to 
give a w ay a fe w of the se wit hout inst r uctions fr om 
Sweden.  I took t he ris k t o
 be fire d, but anyhow . 
. . 
Q: Can you tell us
 about the fi rst time you did it? 
A: Well, it was one of the days just after the inva
sion when I was sitting at 
home, and then
 came one  
of my frie nds.  He wa s Jewi sh 
hea d of one  of the bi g Swedi sh 
c o mpani e s in Budape st.  He wa s 
coming a nd he was hi ding his  star
 wi th a port f oli o like  thi s (i ndic a
ting).  And he sa
id to me "Per  
Anger , you have to help me
."  I said, "Is t his a ne w 
situation? "  I sai d, " We ha
ve instructions to help 
Swedi sh c iti zens , a nd we have no instructions t o 
hel p any other nati onals.  That 's agai nst e ver y 
international law and all that."  
So I  don't know what 
to do, but a fter I thoug
ht of it for a while, I 
said, "I give you a pr ovi si onal pass por t."  And the n  not
 onl y to hi m, but to his wi fe , to hi s daughte r , 
and to all t h e grandc hildren.  So
 the  whole fa mi ly got pr ovi sional pas sports, a nd I s aid -- I wa s  
waiti ng for s o me r epri ma nds  fr om
 Stockhol m, but they, fair enoug
h, t hey a ppr ove d a fte rwar ds .   
Q: Di d you write  a  re por t to th
e m t o s a y what
 you had done? 
A: Oh, ya .  Cert ainl y, I do 
that.  I describe the situation and all 
that, of course.  And the n we worked  
in that sort of direction, mo re 
or l ess .  We gave t he m -- we c oul
dn't ke ep provisi onal pass ports too 
ma ny, but we invent ed t hese  certi fi c a
tes.  We established so
rt  of certi ficat es saying t h at the holder  
of this certificate has just applie
d for Swedish citizenship
, and until he gets that he is under the  
prote ction of the Swedi s h gover n me
nt.  The doc u ment ha d s t a mps an
d e veryt hing on it, you see .  
And al so, we got aut hori zation from
 Sweden t o give vi sa t o peopl
e who c oul d show t hat they ha d 
relatives in Sweden and all that an
d s o on, and t o the m we ga ve this.  Also, identit y papers sayi ng 
that the holder of this paper has got
 visa to Sweden.  Until 
he is able to travel 
to Sweden, he's under 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
15 
 
the prot ection of the Swedis h gover n ment .  I me
an, a comp letely legal 
doc ume nt a ccor ding t o  
international law, but th
e Nazis, you know, there 
were many of those Nazi
s who were illiterate, and 
they were very impressed by pape
rs with stamps and a
ll that and so on.  So
 we  got ma ny examples  
of how those people -- ma ny of
 those people were saved fr om
 being de porte d t hrough showing 
these  pa per s, so eve n t o own t he m.  We  is sue d 
a round 600, 700 of t hose 
papers and t hese  pe opl e  
wer e sa ved.  But , you se e, the 
numb ers of those people increase
d t he whole ti me , and we couldn't  
cope with it .  We were only, a s 
I t old you, a ha ndful of pe ople in th
e embassy.  So that comes to the 
ne w situat ion; t hen we  as k fo
r more st aff from Sweden.   
Q: At this ti me , were ot her gr oups, wer e other 
legati ons , the  neutral s, al s o writi ng out provi sional  
pass ports l i ke thi s?  
A: Well , the r e wa s, of course , the 
Swiss already had the British intere
sts.  You see, in all the wars, 
the fi rst world war, the 
s econd worl d war, bot h t he ne utral c ountries li ke  Swit zerla nd and Swede n  
have taken upon the m t o prote ct the e ne mies ' i nter est
s.  In othe r words , you 
can't ke ep your e mbas sy 
in the enemy's capitol.  So, fo
r instance, in Budapest
, the Swiss had the Am
erican and the British 
interests and to hold their buildin
gs a nd cit i ze ns a nd prot ecte d  th
e m, you s ee.  And we  had othe r  
countries like Holland
, Fi nland, we e v en had the 
Soviet  Uni on's int erest s i n 
Buda pest  and 
s o on.  So 
they were under our  pr ote ction.  
Now, Switzerland had th
e British interests and 
the British had thi s  
old syst e m wit h Palesti ne ce rti f
icates which the Swiss 
took over , e na bli ng people t o  i mmi grat e t o 
Switzerl and -- to i mmi gr ate to Pal esti ne.  Aft er ward, 
Israel, but Palesti ne at  that ti me .  And that was, 
of c ours e, ve ry res t ricti ve  beca us e the  Briti sh wer e
 not  ve ry a nxi ous  to i n creas e tha t  quota be cause  
their int erest s, thei r relati ons hip wit h t he Arabs and 
all that .  And s o that 's a  long st or y a nd s o on, but  
didn't  pre ve n t the  Swiss  fr om goi ng 
on and i ssui ng thos e pape
rs.  So I t hink t hat 
was t he start for t he 
Swiss, was the Palestine cer
tificates, and if they th
en changed that 
i nto the  sa me prot ec tive pass port  
as we had -- I don't rememb
er, but I think they di d the sa me t hing.  Finall y, the y copie d us, li ke the  
other s, like  t he Spa nis h peopl e a nd t h e Portuguese  an
d so on.  So I think th
ey more or l ess followed 
in our  footst eps .

______ ha d, but not  at
 that ti me, you know.  It
 became more and more important later on towards 
the end of the war , you know, when
 we were all in the same boat, 
you see, wher e we were all living 
undergr ound a fter  havi ng be en

 the Nazis.

A: Oh, ya, yes. 

Q: Di d you visit t hat ghett o?  

A: Well , I went, I wa s there, of co

Q: So t he si tuation changes agai
n ra dicall y bet w een Ma y a n d J uly 
whe n  the se huge deportati ons 
begi n?  
A: No, well , you s ee, t he sit u
ati on was this:  That whe n you 
come t o Jul y, t he n  the whole  
countryside was evacuat ed and th
e 600,000 pe ople were alr eady 
sent t o Ausc hwit z fr om the  
country.  200,000 people were s
till in Budapest, and then
 except fo r this Manf
red-Vice (ph) family 
and a fe w others, what ma
naged to escape, there were 200 pe
ople -- 200,000 Jewish people still in  
Buda pest .  So our conce ntrati on 
then when Wal l enber g co mes was 
t o try t o save those  who were  
there in Budapest. 

Q: Can you tell me 
a little bit about a little bit pr
ior to Wallenberg comin
g, a Mr. Langley (ph) wh o 
was i n t he embassy and connect ed
 with t he Swe di sh Re d Cr os s, what  was  he tr ying to do?  
A: We ll, he was the 
-- li ke I said from t he beginning, t he c u
l t ural a ttac hé beca use  he  wa s tea chi ng  
Swedi sh at t he universit y  and all 
that.  So we appointed him cultura
l attaché at the 
e mb assy, a nd he  
wa s a very good man.  Had a fa nta s
ti c feeli ng for his fell owma n and a 
great  ideali st and so on.  He -
- I would s a y that he wa s the ma n who pus hed us 
very muc h to do s o met h ing, bec aus e he kne w, he 
kne w muc h more t ha n we di d a bout t he Hungaria n sit uati on.  He  ha d li ve d ther
e for al l the year s, so  
he ha d a fe eling more t han we wh
at was coming on.  So he insi
sted very much from the very 
begi nni ng t h at, of cours e , this is good what we a r
e doi ng he r e, but we ne ed more st a ff.  We nee d 
more help.  And why don'
t we  as k Count Bern
adotte (ph) to come to Sw
eden, to come
 to Hunga ry 
wit h a Red Cross dele gati on to tr y to do some thi ng?  
 Now, that fai l ed beca us e Ber na dotte  (ph) neve r  
got vi sa to go to Hungar y.  The Ge r ma ns re fuse d 
to have a relative of th
e  Swedis h monarc hy on the  
battlefi eld there.  They c
ouldn't see that, so that
 never happened.  But we
 raised the question in  
Stockhol m t hat we nee d  more sta
ff.  And t hat 's how -- 
and not onl y for that pur pos e, but als o for  
sa feguar ding the other c o untrie s ' i nter ests, you see .
  So I we nt home -- well , I don't know di d you 
say tell t his  chronol ogic al orde r or not , but Wa llenb
erg c o me s first .  And the n I we nt ho me in 
Au gu st wi th  my wi fe a n d 
our baby, l eft t he m home t o get sta ff,
 more st a f f for t a
king care of these 
other countries' in
terests, you see.  So
 this little embassy of fi ve peop
le grew to quite
 an enor mous  
orga niza tion.  We had t he  a mba ssa dor
 who wa s ve r y loyal t o
 thi s acti on a nd very 
-- I mean, for us it  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
18 
 
was a great  t hing, and 
for  Walle nbe rg also, of c our se, t hat he 
was st ayi ng on.  It ga ve our  e mba ssy a  
presti ge whi ch the other s didn't have.  The Swi ss Ambas sa dor , when it  started t o -- the bomb s  
starte d to fal l , he we nt t o Swit
zerl and.  The Port uguese left;  the 
Spani sh Ambass ador
 left; all of 
them left .  So the only one rema
i ning was -- of c ours e, t he Vatican r epre s entati ve, he wa s ther e and 
our a mbass a dor .  So we  could al wa ys -- we al wa ys ha d this base of a  strong e mbassy wit h an 

a mbas sa dor and all that, whi ch guara ntee d legalit y of
 our existence and all  that
 a nd so on.  So tha t  
wa s how our situation wa s.  And th
e n I we nt home  to ge
t all these people for 
the special secti on for  
the foreign interests.  So we 
had the original emba
ssy, where I wa
s sitting in the middle as a 
coor dinator , more or l ess , to start with, to c oor dina te the e nor mous depart ment ______ e stabli she d.  

The  Re d Cr oss, whic h La ngle y was ba
sing, was l ea ding, we had the  Sa
ve t he  Chil dren, a l ady call ed  
Ast a  Niels e n  (ph) , s he wa s als o in
 t he Re d Cross i n  a way or Sa ve 
the Children Fund
.  That was t he  
three , we ha d this big de part me nt for the for eign in
tere sts.  We  had one s pe cial secti on for buying all  
the foodst u ffs and all that  on the bl ack mar ket outs
i de Budapest for the houses where we had all th e 

people  hi ding a nd all  tha t  and so on.  So 
thi s beca me  rea lly qui t e a  bi g orga nizati on. 
Q: Te ll me one thing about La ngle y.  Did t his ha ppen  pri or to t he arrival of Ra oul Wall e nber g?   Did 

he put  si gns on buildi ngs that sai d, " U nder  
the prot ection of t he  Swedi sh Red Cr os s"?  
A: Uh-huh, ya.  He  
was very well-me aning.  He
 tried t o he lp, a nd t he proble m wi th hi m was , of 
cour se, t hat he wasn't that well or ga nize d, s o as 
soon one come a nd as ke d for hel p, he said, "Oh,  

here , you ha ve a pa sspor t or Re d 
Cross," and s o on, a n
d he  took under his  prot ecti on hospit als an d 
chur che s a nd all that  and put on t he s i gn " Thi s is 
under pr otecti on of the Sw
edis h Red Cr oss ."  And,  
you see , t his  beca me  ki nd of i n flati on of thos e pa pe
rs, and s o it  beca me  di ff
icult for hi m in the long 
run t o de fend all t hese .  So t his wa s a  hea dac he fo
r us very oft en to rus h 
out when t he Nazis i nva de d 
one of his hospit als , for us to 
rush out and try to st
op these Naz i s from doi ng s o met hing like t ha t . 
But he hel pe d ma ny, and he save d many people , so 
he should have all the 
credit for that.  But the 
proble m was , as I sa y, that he ne
ver kne w where to stop. 
 I mean, there was also disc ussions I ha d 
wit h Ra oul Wa llenber g later on, " We  ca n't  gi ve
 prote ctive pa ssports  to
 the whol e Budape s t  
populati on beca use  the n they will
 ha ve no value .  So we  ha ve
 to hide our sel ves be hind a

bure aucr ac y."  But we were
 able to show, the Ge rm
ans could come i n and lo
ok at our files and see  
thos e pe opl e  had prot ecti ve pa ss port s.  Bec aus e this
 man has a  cousin i n Swe den.  Thi s pers on i s  
mar r ied to a Swedi sh gi rl .  This ma n is head of 
big Swe dis h -- s o thos e criter i a were very i mport ant  
to keep and t o have as 
a kind of a prot ection agains
t accusati ons that wer e going around.  So it  was a 
well  or ga niz ed bur eaucra cy whic h hel ped us. 
Q: Let 's  st op now, so we can
 change t he fil m.  Tha nk you.
  It was a perfect ending.

Q: I f you c a n, ke ep
 the  c hronol ogy. 
A: Keep t he chronol ogy?  
Q: Yes .  

A: I'll try. 

Q: Okay.  I'll try, too. 

A: If it's possible. 

Q: Mr. Ange r, Ra oul Wal l enberg arrives J uly 9t h, 
1944, ri ght?   You 
kne w that he  was comi ng.  You  
had been a sked about hi m.  What
 di d you think about the pr esence 
of Ra oul Wall enberg comi ng t o  
Buda pest?  

A: We ll, fi rst they asked us.  We
 are intending -- the foreign offi ce
 ca ble d us, we are i n tendi ng t o  
send Ra oul Wa llenber g to Buda pest
 in this one Italian mission. 
 We didn't know the bac kgr ound  
then about t he negotiati ons i n Stoc khol m bet wee
n the Ameri can Embassy 
and the Jewish -- well ,  
congres s on one hand and this for eign office on t h
e other.  But we only 
got the message " We are 
intending to send Raoul 
Wa llenber g.  We want your comme nt s ."
  And I sai d to t he a mb assa dor , " O f 
cour se, t his coul dn't be better be
cause  I know hi m, and I know he 's 
the right man."  So , of course , 
they woul d never have se nt hi m i f
 we had s aid, " N o, for he ave n 's 
sake, don't send Wallenberg."  But 
that was ne ver the que sti on, s o he 
came as you said on the 
9t h of Jul y t o Buda pest .  Lat e, of course , 
too lat e , but that was not  his fa u
lt.  Nobody's fault . 
 Of course, the whole 
c ountrys ide was alre ad y 
evac uate d a nd so on.  So onc e he was appoi nted, 
he travele d  day and ni ght to c o me  as soon as 
pos sibl e t o Buda pest . 

Q: What happened whe n he fi rst arrived?  
 What  was your fir st disc ussi on a bout?  
A: Well , he came ther e to
 the embassy where we wer e
 in full work trying to i
ssue those papers I told 
you about.  The  whole ga
rde n of the e mbas sy wa s full  of pe op
le who we r e  lini ng up t here .  Who 
knows who they were , a nd t r yi ng to
 issue t hose di fferent  certifi cat
e s a n d s o on.  And t her e h e  
comes, and as I  desc
ri be  it i n my book, he c o
mes then with equipment ra
ther odd fo r a diplomat. 
He 's c arryi n g slee ping bag a nd a kna psac k a nd t h e re
volve r , a nd he was ve ry pr oud to s how me t his  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
21 
 
revol ver .  And, of cours e, I kne w
 that everyone in the embassy 
ha d a  re vol ver some where l ying.  
But the man coming was like this 
(i ndicati ng) a n d he joke d.  He 
had a good se nse of humor, al so, 
Ra oul Wa lle nber g.  So you se e, t his 
only -- it give s me more c oura ge t o
 ha ve thi s  in my  poc ket.  He  
never use d it , of course , never .  But he  had it wit h
 hi m and so on.  And the 
s l eepi ng bag and all this 
equi pment was very -- this ca me  to 
us e, of c ourse , later on.  Which he
 ha d t h is ki nd of a mis sion, of  
course, that he had been 
in the military serv
ice in Sweden like I, and we
 had met there, so he knew 
what it wa s t o sle ep unde r a tree  
and all that  and so o
n.  So he  wa s perhaps 
thi nki ng of a sit uati on  
where we were goi ng t o  be bombed 
out and all t hat and so on.  So he ha d this s ort of e qui pment  
wit h hi m, and then he  sa w all t h
is activity around.  He
 s aid, " What are you do
ing here ? "  I brie fe d  
hi m; I ga ve sort of a  de s cripti
on of what we are  doi ng, a nd he 
s a w the doc ume nts.  And t hat is  
typic al for hi m wit h hi s inve ntivene s
s that he mo re or l ess on the s pot
 said, "Well, it's  very good.  
But  I t hink of an i dea -- I ha
ve i dea one c o uld per ha ps  make  
them more spect acular , t hese 
certi ficates."   Same r eadi ng as I  
ha d once upon a ti me  in
vented mysel f , but  no
w a d oc u me nt wit h a 
Swedi sh e m ble m, t he Swe dis h coa t  of ar ms on i t  
in blue and yellow colors and the ambassador 's 
signatur e and sta mps a n d so on.  
It made it more like an official
 docu me nt, a n a u
thentic Swedish 
pass port i n a way.  So t hat wa s 
his first -- the fi rst action was to
 inve nt this.  And t hen another  
qualit y he ha d was t hat he was very
 good ne got iat or.  I  kne w t hat 
beca use he had bee n in Budapest  
be for e 1942, '4 3 ne gotiati ng for hi s fir m i n Stoc kh
ol m about tr ade .  And I 
followed hi m there to see 
how he ne gotiated a bout this quota of foods tuffs co
ming fr om Hu ngary to Sw
eden and so on.  So I  
discovered t here that  he was a good
 negotiat or.  That  al so came to
 use because he 
t h en started t o 
negotiate with them, the new gove
rnme nt, about these  pass ports.  
And he got t he  appr oval  of, s ay, 
4,500 pas sports.  And al so 
the approval to have t hese people liv
ing in houses under our protection. 
That  was his first  acti o
n, to say,
 and . . . 
Q: Was that his i dea, 
also, t he sa fe  houses?  
A: That wa s  his idea .  That was hi s idea .  Oh, 
yes, it was be caus e, you s
ee, there were
 so ma ny 
e mpty house s beca us e Je wis h pe opl
e had bee n living in t heir apart m
e nts .  And the n 
t he first st ep 
wa s, of c ourse, t o put  on t he yell ow s t ar on y
our clot hes, and the seco
nd, that  you c ould be  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

identified.  And then
 you ha d to go toget her i n
 hous es with t he ye llow st ar on it , a nd they had t o  
leave their rooms , you s ee, and bei n g concentr at ed 
in spe cial  hous es.  And the ne xt st ep a fter that  
wa s, of c our se, to be br ought to 
the general ghetto in th
e cit y, a nd fro m t her e on 
to Auschwi t z.  That  
wa s t he sort  of proc edure  in a wa y. 
 But it's interesting th
en that prior to his arrival, I was in charge 
of the e mbas sy one day when t he c a blegr a m ca me 
fr om t he King of Swede
n, t he old ki ng, Gust avus  
V, t hat he a p peals t o halt , to stop all t hese deporta tions .  So I deliver ed tha t , and I re me mbere d that  

my a mba ssa dor was on l eave a nd I te le
phoned hi m, and he s a id, " Oh, 
I'll come with you, then."  So 
we dres sed up in morni ng coats , y
ou know, t hat you ha ve 
when you meet Head of 
St ate , as is rat her  
pec uliar sit u ation i n the mi ddle of 
the wa r, you know.  This l ong t ails
 a nd all that a nd high top hat s , 
and we nt to Horthy and prese nte d 
the me ssa ge fr om t he ki ng.  And Ho
rthy looked at it and he said, 
"Oh, this is terrible.  I can't be
lieve that my compatriots are co
mmitting themselves
 those crimes, 
and I 'm so unha ppy a bout all t his 
and that."  And he se
nt  a me ssage bac k t o 
the king i n Sweden, 
sayi ng t hat he was going to do hi
s be s t .  And he ac tually stoppe d 
de port a tions fr om 
-- it was too late 
for the ______, but he  stoppe d 
deport ations fr om Budapest.  
The y had j ust c a me t o the 
surr oundi ngs .  Se veral ar eas of Buda pest had a l re a
dy bee n evacuat ed.  I wa s mys el f t here a nd sa w 
it, but when it ca me t o Buda pest 
itself, it stopped because of all th
is intervention. 
 So it's this  
peculiar situation when Raoul Walle
nber g had t h en st arte d off all thi s act i on t o have  peopl e unde r  
our prote ction wit h pass ports li ving in these house s
 and all tha t , eve r yt hing wa s or gani z ed.  And he 

said, " Well , I 've done my
 job, a nd no more de por t ations wil l  ta ke
 pla ce.  So I better pre p are my trip 
back to Sweden."  This
 wa s in Au gu st, th
e end of August, I t hink.  Th
e beginning of September, 
perhaps, when the new s
ituation later on comes wh
en after the revolution 
when t he __
_______, t he  
Hungaria n Nazis ta ke ove r.  Then, 
comes the real job, an
d it 's -- you thi nk in ter ms of nine months  
when Ra oul Wa llenber g wa s th
er e, fr om Jul y to January, and of 
those nine  mo nt hs, he use d the fi rst  
mont h just t o orga niz e things.  But t he real res cue
 oper ations where he al s o 
went out to the railway 
stations and all that -- I 
wa s very often with him an
d all that  a nd so on.  It
 wa s a concentrated work 
of three months where he
 saves all those people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

Q: Let's talk about this 
period between July and Oct
ober just a little bit.  Wh
en he came, 
did he have  
a for mal mi ssion t hat he announce
d t o you, or wa s it ver y cle ar what
 he wa s supposed to do from 
some paper s that yo
u had received bef ore? 
A: Well , he had a clear  mandate 
from the foreign office. 
 He  ha d negotia ted or ha d al ready st arte d  
negotiating in a clever way wi
th the  for eign office , a nd got
 a mandate t o  operate quite 
inde pe nde ntl y, but  under ,  of c our se , t he c over of 
the e mba ssy and s ubordi nate d, of c o urse , t o the  
a mbas sa dor .  And i n the  cas e of t he  a mbas sa dors  
del egati ng me  under my 
sort of command in a  
wa y, but we  were s ort of equal a nd good frie nds  so
 that was no problem at all.  So the edict was 
quite c l ear t hat he c oul d per for m 
a s he thought would be
 the most use ful, most -- t h e best one t o  
save as ma ny pe opl e as pos sibl e.  That he use d 
then unconventional method
s a nd all t h at, that was  
hard -- I me an, you see, it was in 
a way very typical situ
ation was this:  That 
I was sitting there at 
the Oder ( ph) Swedish Embassy an
d ever ybody was sort of respecti
ng an embassy and all that and 
so on.  I wa s  a dipl omat;  my bos s 
wa s  a dipl omat , all that dra m atic 
s t atus.  Ra oul  Wall e nber g was a 
busi nes s ma n , but he wa s  also give n dipl omatic st at
us , no doubt about t hat .  So he ha d the sa me  -- 
fr om the international law, fr om 
that  vie wpoint , he ha d the s a me 
stat us a nd the sa me prote ction as  
we  ha d, but being more  or le ss  
a fr e elanc e or ha ving his own depa
rt ment and all t hat .  We closed 
our e yes ver y ofte n whe n he did 
t hings whi ch a diploma t  ne ve r doe
s.  Bri b e pe ople , like that , you  
know, to save people 's li ves or doi
ng t hings out of the or dinary and 
so on.  And we 
thought that was 
a good way of organizi ng the wor k.  That he goe s 
"Oh, look, here.  With the e mbas s y we ar e not  
doi ng that," and s o on.  
And we don't know a bout anyt hing ill egal
 a nd s o on a nd s o on and so on. 
The r e you c o me to a que stion, whi c
h I don't know if you 
would like me to talk 
about now.  And tha t  
is the relati onshi p bet we en Swe den and Ger ma n y. 
 How on earth, why did they ac ce pt this , the  
Ger mans?  That 's a good question. 
 Shall we talk about that?  That
 is, of c our se, t he r e you ha ve a 
country or a city, i n t his c ase, 
completely under the command of 
the Ger m ans , but ha vi ng a puppe t  
government.  The German and Hunga
rian gover n me nt who is  in c har
ge whom they could handle as 
they -- I  mean, they coul
d deci de anythi ng, t he Ger ma ns .  Th
ey could fi re the 
gover n ment;  they  
coul d do a n ythi ng.  But they let t his governme nt 
act because for the i mage 
of Germany it was in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
24 
 
wa y good to show that we are -- ha ven't occ upi ed
 Ge r many, Hungary t o ensla ve the m, to ha ve  
them.  They are a fr ee country, and they have their 
old governme nt, and they ha
ve all that and so on.  
That is their relationship between
 the  Hungari ans .  Now, but  how co
uld t hey accept  t hen that t he 
Hungaria ns we nt on a nd made agr ee me nts with Swed
en about the Jewish peop
le who they liked to 
extingui sh, t o e xter mi nat e?   And t h
en comes this situation into th
e pi ctur e  that Ger ma ny wa s very  
anxi ous, e specially towa rd
s the end of the war, t o ha ve a bre a
thing hole up i n the north.  Ha ve a  
neutr al count ry ther e wit h  whom the y coul d ne got i ate
.  The y could have t hei r spies t here ,  of c ourse , 
and all that.  That was -- all th
e pe ople, both side s, were ha pp
y to have Switz erla nd a nd Swede n  
beca use the y  coul d mee t  and t he y could -- s ort of 
a  country whi ch was not i nvolve d in t he war .  And 
some authors, and I'm not quite su
re that I share all th
is opi ni on e ntirel y a nd s o
 on, but the fac t  i s  
that t o wards the end of t he war 
the Germans tried, even
 fir s t the under g round i n Ge r ma ny trie d, 
thos e people  who were  fi ghti ng a gai nst Hitl er 
tr i ed t hrough our  pe opl e 
in Sweden through the 
Wa llenbergs -- that's  the relatives of Raoul -- to get contact 
with the allies.  Not 
with the Soviets, but 
with the others, with the British an
d the Americans.  Tried to get c
ontact with them through us to 
say t his:   That why c oul dn't we tr y 
to make a deal here 
now, and we will try 
to do some t hing?   And 
they tried to kill Hitler, but they
 didn't manage.  And on the conditi
on that we capitulate the Jew an d 
that we  c oul d ma ke a s e parate  a gree me nt wit h J e
w.  And we all 
-- and t hen Hi mmler worked on 
that.  It 's funny, but he al so worked on that ide a la
ter on whe n he sai d to Be rnadotte , I think, that we  
must all  now stand up against t his
 Communi stic danger.  They are 
going to inva de 
Europe, and, yo u 
know, we all have to fi ght agai
nst the Co mmunist.  And wh y don't we
 now -- why don't you help us  
to ma ke an agreement with
 the allies that we could stop the wa
r with them and we
 all join force 
agai nst t he Soviet?  Completel y un
realistic i dea, of  course, because 
t her e wa s 100 perc ent soli darit y 
bet ween the Ameri cans a
nd Engl and on one si de and t he Sovi et
s on t he ot her si de to win t he war  
agai nst the Naz i s.  That wa s how it 
wa s.  In othe r wor ds , I thi nk that this ti me t hen i n 1944 when t h e  
war  was comi ng closer to an end 
that they thought perhaps that it
's  good to have Sweden.  You 
never know, per haps we  could ha ve their hel p, I 
don't know, and so on. 
 And by all me ans  one  
shouldn't violate the diplomat relations between 
Sweden and Ger many, and 
they respected us as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
25 
 
dipl omats  the whole ti me.  Even Ei
chmann respected, in a way, Walle
nber g e ven i f he hate d hi m. 
And t he y tri ed onc e to ki ll hi m i n 
le tti ng one of the bi g tr uck drive i n
to Raoul Wallenberg's  car, but  
Ra oul Walle nber g was n 't  there .  An
d we r eporte d that t o St oc khol
m, and St ockhol m i nst ructe d our 
e mbas sy i n Berli n to protest in t he Ger man For e
i gn Offic e.  And they di
d, a nd t he Ger man For e i gn 
Office got  upset and they reprimanded Eichma nn an
d said, "Why on earth do
 you do things li ke  
that?  We have to respect  the Sw
edes, the Swedi sh i mmunit y, t he di pl
oma t s  and all that."  And t he n  
comes t his r ather funny answer fr
om hi m.  You can find tha t  now 
in the files which are all open 
now.  The n he ans w ere d  back, he sai d, " Well , I 'm 
sorry, but I coul dn't hel p  doing this , trying to do  
this be ca use  Raoul Wall enberg used such unc onvent
i onal methods."  I magine.  So t hat explai ns,  
partly explai ns why they accepted 
Raoul  Wall enberg.  And 
t hey sai d after all a handful of Jewish 
people , if t h ey ca n be sa ved j ust for our i ma ge to
war ds Sweden, it 's only goo
d they --  perha ps that  
was what they thought.  And 
there on one side of this, why, 
how did Wallenber g mana ge?   And 
even I , when I spoke t o Ger man 
offi cers at t he r a ilway stati ons, ope
ne d t h ese doors  he re.  We  ha ve  
Swedi sh people the r e and so on.  It 's  just be cause  of t his re as on that the y wa nte d to be corre ct, t o  
say, towar ds  us.  And I had, of
 cour se, my connectio
ns wit h  the e mbas s y, Ger ma n Emba ss y in 
Buda pest wa s wit h the ordina ry dipl omats .  And 
they hel ped me someti me
s to get visa for some  
people a nd s o on.  But t h ere was onl y a fe w cas es , so
 we had t hese offici al connecti ons wit h them. 
And it's interestin
g then when t he w
hole comes to an en
d, when all the Germ
ans evacuate fr om 
Buda pest , there was a tel ephone 
call fr om the Ge r ma n e mbas sy whic h sa ys, " C oul d you ta ke over  
our  inte rest s ? "  We ha d already t h
e  Soviets  a nd the others and s o on
, a nd we got  instr uctions  from 
Stockhol m, "By no mea ns,
 no ."  B ut  we ma d e  a co mpr o mis e ,  so
 we t old  t he Ger ma ns ,  "Okay , we  
will take over the keys to your build
ing.  We 'l l have that now."  So 
I went up to the place up on the  
side where t hey have the  e mbas sy a n d met this 
te rrible ma n, _________ was 
his na me .  He was not  
onl y a mba ss ador , but he wa s the kind of a gover n or
 for t his whole part -- a Ger ma n gover nor for 
this whole of the world.  And th
ere he was standing very polite 
and gave me the 
keys, and that 
save d us  in a way.  Late r on, to
war d s the --  tha t 's a long stor y --
 how that saved us towards the 
Hungaria n offi cers .  Of c ours e, t he n
 we got  a paper sa ying tha t  we  ha
ve now t he i ntere s t s.  We  have  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301

the interests of the German
 Embassy and all t hat .  So
 when they tried to arre
st one of my
 colleagues,  
Ber g (ph), he ma na ged t o esca pe , tha nks t o this .  
He wa s -- it 's a lon g st or
y, when they inva ded t he -
- when t he Hungaria n offi cers 
i nva ded the Swe dish Embass y on Christ ma s Eve 1944, t r ied t o  
capt ure us a nd we ma na ged t o es cap
e most of us, except 
a few.  The ladi es, As
t a  Niel sen ( ph) wa s  
taken to the -- first, they were goi ng to shoot.  
They li ne d t he m up a gai ns
t the wall to
 shoot t he m,  
but t he y didn't do that.  I don't k
now why.  Then they took them to the ghet to and ther e with the help 
of the International Red Cross we li
berated the m, you se e.  I wasn't at
 the embassy at that time, so I  
was hidi ng i n another pl ace.  But 
Berg's stor y, Berg was the head 
of the Depart ment of Foreign 
Interests, so when he was captur ed 
he said, " Well , I have to go home
 firs t and pa ck."  They wa nte d  
to take him away, all of 
us they want to take away to the 
we stern Hungary t o whe r e the y wer e  
evac uati ng.  And the n he  said, " N o, I have to go 
home first."  So they gave
 hi m a Nazi man with a 
machi ne gun in his car t o go home to
 pick up hi s belongings .  Instea d, 
he went dir ectly up to t he SS  
hea dquarter s , jumpe d out  of t he c ar a nd said, " We ha
ve your intere sts her e, t he Ger m an i ntere sts.  
And you ha ve to a rrest t his ma n."
  And the Germans arrested this
 Hungarian Nazi and then t hey  
gave Ber g a  bi g paper s aying t hat  Mr. Berg fr
om the Swedish Embassy wa
s taking care of the 
Ger ma n i nte rests .  He 's und er t h
e pr otecti on of t his cl ose  De utch 
Reich of t he big Ge r ma n power .  
And we duplicated that paper a nd 
I don't know how many copies.  Ea
ch of us  ha d thi s copy i n the 
poc ket a nd we s a ve d us  ma ny ti me s ;  we s howe d  that 
to the Hungarian Nazis. 
 It l o oks li ke a fa iry 
tale when you tal k about  i t , but  
it was t he r ealit y at  t hat ti me. 
Q: So i n a certain way, t he Ger man
 Nazis were respecting this very
 stra nge set of be ha viors goi ng  
on?  
A: The y we r e .  What I forgot to
 tell you was , of c ours e, as fa r 
as Ra oul Wa llenber
g was  conce r ne d, 
it was not only the fa ct that he 
was a Swedi sh dipl omat, but it wa s, 
of course, also his personality, I 
mean, which helped a lot. 
 Beca use he was the ki nd of -- whi ch I 
forgot t o tell you -- a kind of an  
actor  in a way.  He
 coul d c hange .  Funn
y, to look at him when we we
re  toget her , he wa s sitt ing,  
spea king i n a soft  voice ,  so he l ooke d mor e li ke
 an intellectual, you know
, like a pr ofessor .  But  
when he me t the Ger ma ns, he yelle d and he use d  th
e same language as t h ey 
a nd i n a very sort  of  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
27 
 
aggr essi ve way, a nd they wer e ver y impres sed, ve ry
 i mpre sse d.  Not onl y wa s he di plomat , but also  
he speaks our language. 
Q: Was  that shocki ng for  you?   
Wa s t h at a  be ha vior  that  . . . 
A: No, no.  I trie
d to do the same 
thing (laughter). 
Q: Let me just go back to someth
ing t hat str uck me as somewhat 
funny.  When you first  produce d,  
printe d the  ________
, you disc ove red some thi ng f
unny in the  c oat of ar ms . 
A: Oh, terrible.  We put 
it in the wrong wa
y.  We  put one crow
n like that and two 
under it; it should 
be t he  ot her  wa y a r ound, you s ee.  But  
nobody t hought of 
it  at  t hat ti me. 
Q: So the first 4,
500 were all . . . 
A: Oh , ye s.  All o f t he m
, all of the m.  All the pr ovi sional pa ssp
orts had that funny e mble m with t he  
crowns put  i n t he wr ong wa y. 

Q: And nobody noticed? 

A: No (laughter). 

Q: Duri ng t hese fe w mont hs be fore  October , be
fore the Hungarian Nazis come in, before the 
__________ come s i n, a re you a nd 
Wa llenber g bot h orga niz i ng the  gr
oup of people wh o will be 
doi ng all the  work, helpi n g?   Ther e 's  
a  huge organiz ation that he  create s. 

A: Ya, ya. 

Q: Yes?  About how ma ny 
people does he bring in? 
A: At  t he start, you mean? 

Q: Yes .  

A: Well , the first  pe ople were
 those whom I  had gi ven t hese  pr ovi si onal  pa ss ports or  these  
certi ficates, that was the base, so
 t o say.  Now, there were per hap
s 20 people or whate ver to st art  
wit h, and t he n it incr eas e d beca use  we ha d given t h
e m ma n y mo re.   B ut t hen
 -- and t h ey organiz ed 
it.  They wer e ver y good orga ni
zers, those people.  Th
ey were heads of Swedish comp anies.  They 
had gre at e x perie nce in deali ng wit h  people  and all 
tha t  and s o on.  So t he y
 kne w how to orga nize  
an offic e.  So he ha d lot s of office s, though. 
 One office , say, for a d mini s t rating the hous es.  One 
office for scrutinizing the applican
ts , the a pplic at ions for pass ports
 and s o  on a nd so
 on.  And one  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
28 
 
part was for the pr ovi sion of medi cine and orga ni
zing t he medical hel p to t hese houses , and one for  
providing wi th food stamps
 and all  that and so on 
and so on and s o on.  So
 towards t he end of thi s  
oper ation, I t hink t hat he  had 
a bout 400 people , J e wis h vol unt e ers who wer e all  wor king. 
Q: So it 's  a good bure au
cr acy.  I mean, that  had to
 be very quickly formed. 
A: Oh, yeah.  Oh , ab
solutely.  Oh, yes. 
Q: I'm not sure that mo st peop
le understand how complicated it
 might be to ad
minister this. 
A: Oh, yes.  Very
, very, very mu ch. 
Q: An d wa s he th e o ne w
ho actual ly admini stered -- I mean, wa
s overseeing everything or was the 
people that had vol unt eer ed at the top, they wer e
 doi ng it and he was doing very partic ular ki nd of  

things? 

A: We ll, he  did bot h.  I 
don't know how he had ti me  for  bot h, 
but , of c o urse , he had a ke rnel  of 
people who he reli ed upon t o st ar
t with, a ha ndful who i s
 hi s close st c olla borat ors .  You s ee on t h at  
pictur e wher e he sits at a table 
and is s urrounded by about  si x or 
seven pe ople.  Those  were the key 
people who had di ffere nt  offices un
der their co mmand, so t o say.  
So he dele gate d, of cour se, very 
much to the m, but  he  s u pe
rvi se d hi msel f ever ythi ng as  muc h a s he c oul d. 
Q: Is ther e any such thi n g as extr
at er ritorialit y?  When you created
 these safe hous
es, is there any 
international law that really allo
ws  for this kind of creation? 
A: It 's ver y - - it was a big bluff, the whole t hi ng.  I  me an, how 
can you -- I me an, 
you s ee acc or ding 
to international law, 
there i s di fferent degr ees of ext r
aterritorialit y.  The 100 per cent 
extraterritoriality is the embass
y itself.  They have the buildin
g where you are sitting and working 
and t he a mbassa dor 's re s i dence.  The n come s, s a y, 
my re side nce , sort of second degr ee, a nd then  
you have perhaps some  offi ces for 
is s uing pass por ts.  Another third 
de gre e, or  what ever  it wa s, but  
in sort of putting on a label on a 
house saying that this 
is under our pr ote ction bec aus e, I don't know, 
we own it or  whatever.  We creat ed t hat oursel ves a
nd in all this mess, in al
l this confusion and with  
the Germans in a way 
tolerating it, it worked till th
e real Nazis, the Hungaria
ns, took over.  Then we  
had grea t di ffic ult y in de fe ndi ng
 our offices and whi ch cul mi nated
 on the  day whe n t hey i nvade d 
the e mbassy itself.   
Because t hat was for us neve
r heard of in history.  I 
c oul dn't re me mbe r  anythi ng

when I studied di ploma t ic hist
ory once upon a ti me t hat an e m
bas sy has be en i nvade d by the  
government ' s troops i n that cit y where t hey we
re loc a ted .   So whe n  we were war ne d the n ,  
Wa llenber g and mysel f , on Chri st ma s -- the da y be fo
r e Christ ma s Eve that 
they said, "Now, you 
have to come wit h us, evacuat e fr
om here ."  And wa s tol d that  th
e Germans remai ning i n the forei gn 
office i n Budapest, and t hey
 said, " We ll, i f you don't
 fall out , you have t o take the c ons equences ."  
We ll, we didn't think very muchof it.  Of course, never on earth
 are they going to attack the  
embassy.  They might at
tack Ra oul Wa llenberg's offices, I don'
t know.  But our em
bassy, which has 
100 percent extraterritoriality, 
they won't, bu
t they did.  
Q: Prior to October, prior to the Hungaria
n Naz i s comi ng in, do you know whether Ra oul  
Wa llenber g wa s in touc h wit h t he undergr ound or gani
zations, with the Jewish 
Counsel  i n Hungary?  
Wh at sort of contacts he wa s ma ki
ng, was  he  telli ng you about  this?  
A: Well , wit h the Jewish 
Counsel, we always had co
ntact s, because that was an
 offici al instit ution ,  
as you know, which the Ger ma ns ha d all over t h e 
worl d whe n they had i nva de d a countr y.  That 
wa s for the m a ver y conve nie nt, pr actical way of 
deali ng with the Je wis h que stion.  To channel i t  
through the Jews themselv
es whi ch t hey did the n, of c our se , in Budape st.  They ha d a Je wis h 
Counsel to whom they alwa ys sai
d, " Look her e, i f  you kn
ow, be quiet  now and tell  your pe ople  tha t  
not hing is  going t o ha ppe n," and s o 
on a nd so on.  They 
are jus t  goi ng to move
 you t o a not her c a mp  
and all that.  Through t hese or ga niz ations the y 
ma na ged -- they had a very cle ver wa y of thes e  
deportati ons, you know.  The y got, of c our se, e x pe
rie nce d during the ti me ho
w to do it.  So t hey 
made it, did it step-by-step like th
at , very ofte n wit h the hel p of 
the Jewish Counsels who wer e i n  
good faith a nd t hought t hat t his wa s goi ng t o be only
 movi ng us t o a not her  pl
ac e a nd so on.  And we 
had contact  wit h the m a n d Raoul Wa
l l enberg.  Wh en he came, he ha
d alrea dy a  list of peopl e not s o 
much under ground, but
 social  de mocrats pe ople  and part y pe
ople wh o were against Nazis and all 
that.  That, he ha d and s o on, but 
the r eal cont act wit h t he fi ghting u
nder gr ound, I don't  thi nk that  h e  
had t hat from the be ginning.  I ha d it then la
t e r on whe n it wa s the que stion about de fe ndi ng our  
embassy.  We foresaw the situ
ati o n when the Ger mans who afte
r all wer e a guar antee for our  
protection, when they ev
acuated and an interval 
until the Russians would come
, when the criminals, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
30 
 
the Hungarian offi cers woul
d come  over a nd t here  woul d be no 
rules whatsoever for diplomats, y o u  
see.  We foresaw a situ
ation like that, and so I contacted th
en t he underground, and the y ha d  
promi sed to put people t o our di spos al for de fe
nding us .  And we oursel
ve s bought we apons on t he  
blac k marke t , machi ne guns , to pr ote ct ours elve s. 
 Now, thi s situati on ne ver ca me a b out .  The y  
perse cut ed us and we were hi ding, but it ne ver 
c a me to fi ght ings bet we e n us beca us e when t he y  
wer e starti ng to per sec ute  us a nd we wer e hi ding, 
the Soviets arrive d.  So they ha d no ti me for t hi s  
period we ha d t hou
ght wa s coming.   
Q: In an int e rvie w t hat  you ga ve 
at Uppsala, you said yo
u ne ve r took ris ks.  Do
 you agree with that,  
that you ne ver took any r i sks?   I want  to ask you 
a bout a partic ular situation wit h a Ge orge Libnik  
(ph) . 

A: Ya, Li bbi k ( ph) . 

Q: Libbik ( p h), where you went i n
 a car with hi m and l oaned hi m y
our c ar  at some poi nt.  Is t hat  
true? 

A: Wh at did I do? 

Q: You gave  hi m your  ca r so that 
he  did s o me  thi n gs by hi ms el f. 
A: Oh , yes .  Oh , well , h e  was i n all secre c y -- we
ll, he was my offici al drive r  anyway, but I kne w  
that he was t he under ground 
_____, s o I said, " You can ha ve my c a
r duri n g the night, I  don't care ."  
And I ne ver aske d hi m what he did.
  But a fter war ds, he sai d, " I  
was j ust bl owi ng up t h e muniti ons  
storage for t he Ger mans," and all t hat
, of course.  That would have been
 sort of a great risk for me i n 
my situation towards Germ
a ns , so I -- but we sa ved -- toget her
 we sa ve d his fat her- i n-la w, t he  
Nobel  Prize  winner , Sz ent-Györ gyi . 
 That  wa s t he  bi g t hing.   
Q: What happened Oct ober 15th wh
en the change r eally 
comes, when the Hung
aria ns c o me and th e  
Germans have left? 

A: Well , that  was a chaot i c, chaotic day.  I was -- it 
so happened that I was at the railway station to 
send off the remaining Swedish co
l ony, t he Swedis h la dies  wit h th
eir children and all that.  And 
when I ha d ma na ged t o put the m i n the trai n -- 
it was a train with German troops, but we had 
ma na ged t o get one part of it fo r our pur pos e.  When on t he st ati
on i n the l oudspeaker you all of a

sudde n hear d that now, Hungary is 
free and Hungary is goi ng to -- is
 leavi ng the war, ma king pe ac e  
treaty a nd here and s o on.  So t h
ere ' s not goi ng to be a ny more fi
ghti ngs  for us and so on.  And  
ever ybody st arted t o wonder wha t  is happeni ng 
now.  That was the attemp
t by Herr Holt e (ph) , you 
re me mb er, t o ju mp  t he s hip and  
he  wa s i m me di ately sto
ppe d and t hey s hot hi
s son, Nic kol as Holte  
(ph) .  And aft er a whil e came 
a new message fr om t he l oudsp
eakers  sayi ng wel l , thi s was a  
compl ete mi stake, what y
ou just heard.  It 's goi ng 
on, the war 's goi ng 
on.  And I s aid t o mysel f wha t  
am I going to do now with the Sw
edish transport?  And the German
s said, "Oh, now, there will be 
fi ghtings during the way here and wh
en we leave here, and 
there will be bombings,"
 and all that.  S o  
I face d the  si tuation eit he r  to se nd off these  pe opl e 
or to stop it.  And it wa
s a terrible responsibi lity, 
but I said to myself I don't think it can be worse, af
ter all.  I think it would be
 wor se to st ay on, so I  
gave the si gnal to leave and t hen 
I c oul dn't slee p, of cours e, t hat ni ght .  But a fter a while, I t hink 
some da ys , I  hear d t hat t hey ha d s a fe ly arri ve d i n
 Sweden, all  of 
t he m and s o on.  And t he n the 
whole situation in the c
ity was t he n  the Na zis had t ake n ov
er e ver ythi ng.  Salinge r had be en 
appoint ed t h e ne w Pri me  Minist er, and the y ca nce l ed
 officiall y  all the prot
ective passports and they 
starte d t o att ack, inva de 
all the Swedish houses and 
so on.  So  that was the 
worst da y of t he whole  --  
duri ng thi s whole  pe
riod, I wo uld say. 
Q: At this point in Septem
ber, Wa lle nber g i s i n Pest?  
A: In Pest, ya. 
Q: So t hat  you're not  a s c l ose  ge
ographicall y a s you wer e be for e. 
A: We ll, we  wer e  -- we ll,
 the whol e thi ng was as 
be for e wa s the bri d ges we
re still there.  We 
communicat ed ever y day with eac
h other and so on.  So  the 
di fference wa s that the Nazi 

governme nt  had ta ken over, you se
e.  That was the situation. 
Q: Approxi mat ely how ma ny people  at this poi nt  in
 Oct ober had pr ote cti ve pas ses i n sofar as you 
re me mb er?  

A: Well , we had a bout, s ay, a bout 20,000 li ke that . 
 We had the  offi cial per mis sion for 4,500, but in 
all se crec y we were  hi ding t hree

 these houses. 
Q: And at  the same ti
me , the other legations, 
the ot her ne utral  . . .

A: They al so ha

Q: So t here  wer e  ma ny, ma
ny thousa nds  of peopl e under s o-c alled pr otecti on?  
A: Ya. 
Q: So i mme diatel y t hes e under mined by the  . . . 

A: Not all of the m.  Of c ours e, you don't do that qui
ckly, you see.  It takes 
time .  So the first thing  
whi ch happene d wa s -- whic h was  very critic a l  situati on a l so whe n they later on inva de d the  

Swedi sh Re d Cr os s, La ngley's office and sort of s t
opped t he whole Re d Cr oss 
activities.  And the n  
our  ne goti ati ons  with the m, wit h t he 
Nazis, was that if you go on like this, we  ha ve  to leave this, cut 

off the di pl omati c rel ations wit h H
ungary, which in a wa y t he y di dn't
 wa nt .  That  was t he onl y car d  
we  ha d t o pl ay, c oul d pla y, pr omisi ng the  whole  ti
me  that one  day we wil l
 recogniz e you here  and 
you will be -- I said to 
the Foreign Minister of th

be the fi rst Ambassador 
to St ockhol m, of c ours e.  You are s o respe cte d and 
so cl ever a nd s o, you know."  And he was s ort o f  
very ha ppy wit h thi s i de a to be  
an a mbass ador i n Stoc khol m a fter t h
e  wa r ha d bee n won.  They sti ll 
thought that the Ger mans we
re goi ng t o win the  wa r, 
you see.  That was t he ca
rd we pl ay agai nst t he  
instructions from Stockholm.  Sa
id tha t  ne ver , e ver  will  be  
recognized, this

Q: I'm going to go a little bit ou
tside the particular  situation.  
Wh at is it like 
for somebody t o  
negotiate with people 
with whom you have 
so little respect?   
A: You ha ve  to mobi lize  all your  
e fforts a nd you have to tr y t o c o
py him in a way 
of s o me brut al  
sort of -- you shoul
dn't say that and be polite and 
all that.  Like Wallenberg 
did, of course.  He used 
the s a me har d, ver y hard langua ge a n d sai d a s I di
d.  I negotiat ed wit h hi m.   Of c ours e, t his wa s how 
we  di vide d t he work, t hat  Raoul Wa ll enberg, he we
nt a nd sa w ever yone.  I  
me an, Eichma nn, a nd al l 
thos e pe ople .  I trie d to 
follow the diplomatic 
r ule s onl y to have the c onta ct wit h the front office .  So 
I negotiat ed quite ofte n wit h Ka mie n na (ph) a bout th
is, and he  was not a nor m
al person reall y.  He 
wa s a fanatic and so on.  Raoul Wallenberg had 
anot her a dva ntage bec aus e he kne w his wi fe who  
had onc e upon a ti me  approa che d Ra
oul Wa llenberg to ask hi m, " Can 
I he lp in a wa y? " and so on. 
So he use d that c ha nnel  more; I 
didn't do that.  But I negotiate
d with hi m offici
ally from the  
Swedi sh Embass y which had t he e f fec t  he over  radio an
nounce d; then l ater on, 
that it was a mistake .

The Swedish protective pass
ports are still valid.  That was the 
Raoul Wallenberg's sort of -- the  
result  of hi s efforts. 
Q: Yo u s mil ed whe n y ou  me ntio ne
d t he Bar one ss Ka mi enna 
(ph).  There were ru
mo rs t hat th ey ha d  
some sort of a relations
hi p, she a nd Wallenber g. 
A: Of cours e, it is very easy t o
 dra w that concl usion, but , of 
c our se, I didn't know how Raoul  
Wallenber g acted on hi s private h
ours and so on.  But I ' m quite  su
re t h at that  never  ha ppe ne d, 
anyt hing more tha n she wa nte d to 
he lp, a nd he us ed he r as a t ool t o
wards her husband.  So t hat 's -- 
but it's interesting how in the 
film with Richar d Chambe rlain how --  this Hollywood film -- how 
they developed that a little 
bit more.  That he went 
to the railway station to 
say goodbye to her; that  
is true .  That  he did, and he als o went  there with
 flowers to sa y goodbye .  
That he tol d me .  Whe n  
she was leaving for It aly, 
she was expecti ng a child 
with Ka mienna (ph), an
d she wa nted to ha ve 
that child born in Italy. 
 She le ft a nd he went t o t he stat ion to
 thank her for  all that s he had done t o  
help and ga ve her s o me r oses .  I n thi s  fil m, I do
n't know whet her you sa w i t , 
but it's very interesting 
to see how Raoul Walle nberg come s t o
 the stati on and he 's sta n ding 
be hind a cor ner a nd look, when 
Baron Ka mi enna (ph) says goodbye to
 his wi fe a n d the n he le a ves , an
d the n  train start s t o move and 
Raoul Wallenberg jumps up on the tr
ain, comes in with 
a bottle of cha mpagne 
and the fl owers. 
"Her e, ar e you going wit h me to It
a l y? "  "Oh, no.  I have bribe d th
e people in the next station and 
they're going to stop the train next station.  I 
wa nted to sa y goodbye to 
you."  Typica l Holl ywood  
sort of product, but it was ver y a musing t o see t h
is.  No, she 's -- and ther
e's a beautiful British  
actres s who plays her rol e in this
 fil m, and I a sked this Mr s. Ka mie nna (ph) once , " What do you 

think about the fil m?"  "Well, it wa
s a good fil m, but, you s
ee, I was much prettier 
than that girl."   
Q: There were for ced mar ches 
fr om Buda pest  east -- we st to
 the border.  You and Raoul 
Wa llenber g we nt wit h a drive r  i n
 a  ca r.  What did you s ee?  
A: We ll, we saw all these terribl
e ma rches .  You know, peopl e we
re taken -- it was 
the time when 
all railway t ransport s were i mpossibl e because th
e city was cut off and th
ey were bombed -- the  
railway connections wer e  bombed and 
all that.  So they to
ok the people as they
 st ood and wal ke d in 
the str eet, took t he m a nd pus he d the m.  That wa s  th
e -- al so, Hungarian soldie
rs were mobili zed for

that, marc he d thi s whol e way fr om Buda pest t o 
Debr ece n  (ph) , a nd t hat is t he border  stati on 
bet wee n Austria a nd Hungar y, a bout  20
0 kilome t ers or whate ver it  wa
s.  It took  a 
we ek t o  ma rch  
this, and they died 
on the way, ma ny of
 them.  There wa s snow and it
 wa s c old, a n d they ha d t o  
spe nd the ni ght in t he open air a nd 
all that; it was terrible.  And we 
ha d wi th us s o me foodstuff w e  
wer e distri buting a nd s o on, but the ma in was that 
wh en we c a me t o this bo rd
er stat ion, we or Raoul  
to get back quite a few of them
 who had Swe d ish pas sport s or 
he bl uffe d a nd got  the m bac k 
anyhow.  There ar e so many storie
s a bout that, it would ta ke t oo l ong
 to tell you all 
these di fferent  
situati ons and also s howing hi s inve ntive nes s an
d all that.  But t ypic al is one whi c h a Jewish  
survivor told me once, and that 
is when they were st
anding, a group of a bou
t 50 st udents , Je wis h  
students, waiting for bei
ng handed over to the Ge
rmans.  Raoul 
Wallenberg approached them and 
said, " Are t h ere anyone here wh
o -- or is ther e anyone he re who 
has a Swedis h pa ss port, pr otecti ve  
pass port? "   And ther e were onl y two ca me for war
d.  But then he said, " Well , but you must all  
remember that the othe
r day the authorities confiscated lots
 of your passports, and don't you  
re me mb er th at? "   O h, ye s, t hey  re me mb ere d, 
and the whole crowd came
 for war d, and we t he n  
orga nize d tra nsports back to their hous es wit h th
em.  And there wer e the Ge
r ma ns , and, of cours e, i t  
was a combi nation of our  status and all that and that
 he also ha d some  bottl es
 and things with hi m,  
and he sort of distributed -- 
let his drivers distribute little 
gift s to the Germans around. 
Q: When were these mar ches occu
r r i ng?   It  was  a fte r Oct ober ? 
A: Oh, yes.  It was in 
December .  I n December. 
Q: And what did you do, 
I mea n, when you we nt  wi
t h Ra oul?   I me an, do tell a  fe w i n cide nces  of 
wh en you were with him and what 
you actually saw and what you did. 
A: Well,I helped 
hi m as much as I could,
 and, you see, prior 
to that I helped him,
 also, as often as I 
coul d in spit e of other jobs I had 
espe cially t o c oor dinat e, you know
, all thes e actions , al s o he ada che  
with Langley and with our foreign 
interests and the Soviets.  We  
had Soviets and citizens there and 
Soviet prisoners of war and so 
on.  But  I re me mber one  da y, I 
re me mb er  w hen  I wa s  writi ng  my  
book, I sent the manus cri pt to my 
publisher and he sai d, " A h, I thin
k it 's good.  It 's a good book. 
But I r e fuse t o publis h thi s book i f you don't sa y an
ythi ng of what you di d your
sel f ."  Wel l , I sai d, "I  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
35 
 
haven't written this book for writi
ng about mys el f ."  " Well, you ha ve
 to."  And then I didn't kno w  
what to do, but all of a sudden a friend sent 
me a book called "When Si
x Million People Died."  
And I looked in the index and fo
und my na me , and he rela te d an
 epis ode  whe n Ra oul  Walle nberg  
telephoned me  and said, "I'm so 
busy now, I'm going to 
r un t hat plac e t o save
 people.  But I know 
that now at this and that statio
n, there is a train leav
ing a nd there might be  
Swe dis h pe ople  ther e. 
Plea se, ca n you take ove r ? "   "Of 
c ourse."  And I we nt there a nd us
e d the sa me la ngua ge as Raoul, 
and t here was a Ger man officer an
d I  said, " Ope n the door s," and a
ll that and so on.  And I ca me  
into the car  and t her e wer e about  100 people t her e,
 and I said, " Those  who 
have Swedish passports, 
come for w ar d."  And ther e were on
l y a fe w of the m, one or two or 
three -- I 've forgotte n now.  And 
then I said, "But  I know t hat I re
cognize you here.  I ha
ve  see n you in the Sw
edish houses, and have 
you for got te n your pa sspor
t?  What 's happened?  
And don't you have a ny pa
per that you can show 
that you have ha d a pass ? "   "Oh,
 ye s."  The y t ook and s howed Hungari an papers, dr ivi ng l ice nse s , 
and r ecei pts or what ever in Hungar
i a n language whi ch t he Ger mans, 
of course, coul dn'
t read.  "Oh, 
that pr ove s t hat you ha ve  a Swedis h passport .  Come
.  C o me wit h me."  An
d the y ca me out , all of 
the m, and t h en I ha d as  my help
 a Hungarian offi cer, a police offi
cer was in our servi c e in a way 
unofficiall y and hi s two dogs and in
 full uni for m.  And I sai d, "You ta
ke care of these peopl e."  And 
the Germans thought that he was 
going to take them to a Hung
arian jail or something, but he 
mar che d a w ay, str aight awa y to the Swedi sh houses 
and put t he m i n ther e , you see .  That kind of  
bluff, I learned that from Ra oul , of
 course .  It was n 't  my inve nt ion 
at all, but you as ked me a bout if I  
did a nyt hi ng and t hat i s an e xa mpl e.  I said i f  
tha t  has bee n descri bed i n
 one book, why couldn't I 
relate it in my own?   
Q: Was it frightening to do this? 

A: No, no, no.  I had al
so a cert ai n experi ence to tal k t o
 Ger mans because 
of my pr evi ous 
assignment to Berlin 
and all that.  I  s p oke  their l angua ge . 
Q: B ut wh e n th e _ __ __ ___  was i n,  wh en t he Hung
aria n Na zis were
 in, certai nly you ha d t o be  
taking mo re and more risks . . . 

A: Oh, absolutely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
36 
 
Q: . . . for your own life . 
A: Oh, that wa s, of course, a di
fferent situation.  Absolutely. 
Q: Is t here a nyt hing bet wee n Oct ober and Dece mb
er when you get t he cabl
e fr om Stockhol m t h at 
you wa nt t o t alk about  tha t 's goi ng
 on?  Is the situatio
n now just becoming mo
re and mor e chaoti c? 
A: Ya.  Al so, that was slowly, it wa s deterior
ating and the bombing st
arte d, of c our se .   
Q: Wh en did the bombing start? 

A: Well, the bombings of the allie
s, the air force and a
ll that was going more 
sporadically to start 
wit h, but it wa s t hen conce ntrate d
 very much towards the end.  An
d then when the Russians were  

surrounding the city, they
 were shooting artillery in
to the city and all th
at.  And the worst -- 
absolutely the worst situation was, of
 cour se, whe n the y took
 to the Pest si de first, and we were then 
separ ate d from Ra oul Wa llenberg.  He  happened t o  be
 on that side 
whe n th e y ca me , an d we wer e  o n 
the ot her .  We ne ver knew, you know, where t h e Ru
ssia ns wer e comi ng fi rst.  It l o oke d as t hough 
they were going into Budapest, th
e Buda side, t hey were fir st.  
Because they came
 to surr oundi ngs  
of Budape st, whi ch st opped t he Nazi s for a whil e  to
 pers ecute  us who we r e on that si de.  On the  
Pest  si de, nothing had ha ppe ne d, but  always  it wa s ki nd
 of sur prise  the y at tacke d Pe st fir st i n t he  
begi nni ng of Januar y a nd went t hr ough the undergro
und t o cell ars and caves 
and come i n the back 
of the Ger m ans and al l t hat, and 
t he Ger ma ns t he n pa nicked, tore 
for the bridges a nd tried to get  
over to Buda where they 
were sitting.  And that 
remains then in the Germ
an hands another month 
till they then attacked us.  But du
ring that time, it was 
the most terrible time 
fr om the viewpoint of 
the war because then t he Soviets pu
t on their artillery on the Pest an
d shooting direct fi re up on us  
and destr oyi ng the whole Buda, the 
royal pal ace and all the ot her hous
es.  And we wer e sitting -- i f  
you sta y firs t in the fir st war , 
you mo ve down a nd you e nded up down
 in t h e cave s wher e we wer e  
spe ndi ng our  last  ti me . 

Q: Where were you getti ng food from?  

A: Well, we  ha d s o me s t or
ed tins and sort of foodst
uff, but  we lived the last
 time up in the Buda 
side on a , sa y, one pot at o soup a da y.  Ever yt hi ng 
was gone .  The ele ctr ic
ity, the water, nothing 

exist s any l o nger .  So we
 put on all --  we  took a 
st ove from a c ave a nd put i t
 down on t h e courtyard 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
37 
 
and ha d so me wood, and we we re ma
king fire i n t he m.  We ha d to
 pic k u p so me wat e r fro m a da m 
on outside in the ope n which was reall y use f ul i f 
there wer e wood, fir es and 
so on.  That wa s yellow 
stu ff, wat e r whi c h was n ot ver y tasty .  An d we 
c ooked thos e potat oes a nd had a meal ever y da y of  
potat o soup.  It 's i ntere st
i ng how ma n can sur vi ve. 
Q: Wh en you received that telegr am when you 
t alke d a bout ever ybody s t
andi ng and sayi ng t hat  
they would s t ay, when St
ockhol m t hought that you wer e risk, 
there were t w o wo men -- no, a ctual ly, 
three on the staff.  Two s
ecretari es and Ast a Niel sen fr
om Save the Childre n, ye s?  
A: Yes .  

Q: And were  the y i nvolve d i n t his  dis c ussi on?  

A: Certainly, all of them.   And th
e y wer e -- Asta  Niel sen wa s , o f c
our se, s he was i n charge of this  
savi ng chil dren a nd all.  Absol utel y, she was st a y
ing, she sai d.  And t he two ot her gi rls, we tol d  
the m tha t  you have to lea ve.  And one  of t he m sa
i d she wa s engaged to be 
mar r ied t o a Hungaria n,  
and we real l y didn't nee d  the girls a ny longe r, a nd we underst o od tha t  the y wer e goi ng t o take gr eat 

risks when t he Russi ans we
r e coming and all t hat . 

Q: You mean, as wo me n? 

A: Ya, ya.  So she sai d 
okay.  She accept ed t hen to 
leave wit h the last tran
sport we had. 
 We were 
drivi ng ove r  in the car to Vie nna in Dec e mber, i n 
the mi ddl e of December ju
st befor e the cit y was 
close d.  But  the other gi rl, she starte d to cry 
a nd say, " O h, you don't trus t me , and why s hould I  
leave here?   And I want t o be w
ith you and hel p," and all t hat .  
She was Marguerite Bal l  (ph) was  
her na me .  So we c oul dn't convi nce  her t o go hom
e, so we said, "Okay, yo
u sta y."  So she  was 
staying with us. 

Q: And di d her wor k change?   I 
me an, obviousl y, with t he situat
i on det eriorati ng e v erybody is  
doi ng . . . 

A: Ya, she was still helpin
g to send cables to Swed
en.  We  could communic
ate with Sweden till 
Chr i st ma s when we were  the n inva de d by the Naz i
s, and they cut off all 
our communications with 
Sweden.  So in Swed
en, they di dn't know what
 happene d t o us fr om Ch
r i st mas '44 til
l the end of 
March.  We  completely 
disa ppe are d.  The  Soviet s never  c o mm
unicated with Sweden about what

Q: Let's talk about those last fe
w weeks a little bit more. 
 We re you able to s
ee Wallenberg pretty 
much e very day?  
A: Not e ver y da y, but we tried t o ha ve a conta ct to
 eli minate the risks for th
e whole st aff, for hi m,  
for us.  We  were never st
aying, all of us, in the 
sa me  pla ce.  And we  were
 movi ng ver y  ofte n fr om 
one  pla ce t o anot her .  We  ne ver - -  trie d to never  s p
end every night in the same  
pl ace , s o to
 say.  And 
there he was , of c our se, wit h 
his kna psac k and hi s slee ping bag. 
 He had a greate r  a dva nta ge t o  
move around in there, I mean in t hat  respect.  
So, but we ha d a kind of 
communication, so to start 
with he tried to come  over to ou
r par t .  And he  kne w day- by- day 
wher e I  am going t o stay, and I  
kne w whe r e he wa s goi ng to stay pr et ty regularly. 
 And I went over to Pest 
now and the n and s o on, 
and then, as I say and I write in 
my book, t he last ti me he ca me wa
s the 10th of J anuary 1945 when 
he comes up to the Buda side on
 the hills.  And it 
was a situation where 
the bombs were falling 
down all ar ound a nd all t hat, a nd we wer e goi ng t o
 see a gene ral, an SS general , who wa s sit ting 
deep under in the caves. 
 You know, fr om the hist
orical  ti me , onc e upon a ti me , l ong a go whe n t he  
Tur ks were domi nati ng t hat part of t h e worl d, t hey
 had sort of big unde rg
r o und c ave s which wer e in 
existence.  So I re
me mbe r  from our s mall  ca ve  we ha d i n t h
e  house  wher e  I was st
ayi n g for a whil e, 
you ha d the connecti ons you could go 
furt her down.  Ther e wa s, for 
inst ance , the Int ernati onal Red 
Cross had a hos pital ther e, and that i s the pla ce 
where te ns of thousands 
Hungaria ns t ook re fuge. 
They went t here the day when th
e Russians were encircli ng t he city
, and the final fi ghtings were  
starting.  And thinking that they were going to 
sit there a couple of days
; they were there three 
weeks.  You see, you can i magi ne the situati on am
ong thos e people .  I went down the r e down the n  
and saw it, without food and everyt
hing.  They had s o me  per haps s o
me water to drink and all that 
and so on, but mo st of th
ose pe opl e s urvi ved a ft er  a
ll.  How they l ooked when
 they came up to the 
surface is another question.  So th
ere were all these peop
le underground in t
hose caves sitting there 
waiting fo r the Russians to
 c o me .  And t here  als o 
t he Ger mans had the comman
dos, so there was an 
SS general sitting ther
e with his staff.  
And Raoul and I went
 to him because we
 wanted to have 
so me mo re - -  so me gu ara ntees  fro m
 t he Ger mans that t hey, aft er all,shoul d try to hel p t o pr otect our

houses , you see, and all t h
at.  That i s the sit uati on when t his 
German says to Raou
l Wa llenberg that  
"You are our gr eatest enemy ever, and you ar e hi
ding in your house one
 of t he undergr ound  
fi ghte r s, Hungari ans.  And how c
oul d you do tha t ? "   And t he n Ra oul Wal l enberg ans wer s that " I  
don't do that .  I have ne ver be en hi ding s o meone ."  His na me was De us chufee (ph).  He wa s a  
jour nalist  and he was undergr ound 
fi ghter and al l that .  I knew hi m 
very well, so I 
said to this 
general " Well, look here.  I can gu
arantee t hat  he's not  
there.  We ar e never 
hiding a nybody."  And  
that was our  pri ncipl e, we were  ne ver  hiding a nyon
e in the real embassy bu
ilding or in our private 
home s beca use we  di dn't wa nt t o 
ris k our own e xiste nce , of cour se
.  I f t hey discover ed t hat, w e  
would ha ve bee n de por te d oursel ves .
  I mean, to be a ble t o c onti
nue our work, we 
had to respect 
thos e kind of rules.  So the people we wer e hidi
ng were all in the protectiv
e houses , you know.  And  
he sai d, " We ll, look, I know better ."  And that i s th
e stra nge s t ory that whe n I me et this  man a gai n,  

De usc hufee  (ph) was his na me, i n Cairo when 
I was posted ther e and 
he was then in th e 
governme nt ,  the  libe r al gover n me nt for one  ye ar a f
ter Russians took over, 1
946, '47, and he was one  
me mb er of the governme nt.  So he
 came t o a big conference i n Cairo,
 a nd we we re sitt ing t oget he r  
one eveni ng, and I t old hi m the st
or y about thi s  abs urd st or y.  An
d he  starte d to la ugh and say, 
" Well, of c o urse , I wa s there the whole ti me, but
 you di dn't know it .  I wa
s hidi ng i n one of the  
rooms t here whi ch you didn't know 
a bout.  I kne w thi s old hous e, I kne w it ver y we ll.  So I was  

hidi ng in t he  one room t h ere, a nd I so very oftens a w you and Raoul sitt ing 
having di nner  there over 
the courtya r d.  But  I ne ver tol d you.
"   And it 's  str ange t h
en that thi s Ger m an 
kne w it, but  he  di dn't 
dare  to go i n to t hat buil di ng bec ause i t  was Ra
oul Wa llenberg, it was a Sw
edish diplomat's  home. 
He never vi olate d that .  That was a t ypic al exa m ple 
of this German sort of 
-- this correct sort of 
attitude they tried to main
tain with every Swede. 
Q: And Ra oul didn't know it
 eit her , Raoul  Wall enberg?  
A: Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So that is when I said to 
Ra oul, "Now, you have rea
lly -- now, you ha ve done  
the job here .  Now, you have to thi n k of your ow
n s a fet y absolut ely bec aus
e t he whole sit uation is

on.  And t hat is whe n he
 sa ys , " But you se e, I  
can't st op now a ny longe r be

much as I c a n to s ave as ma ny pe ople  as possi ble . "  Th
at is his last word to me
, the 10th of January. 
Then he  returns to Pe st.  The Germans withdraw, bl
e w up the  bridges , a nd Ra
oul is arrested by the 
So viet troops. 
Q: Di d you t r y t o c onvinc e  hi m 
after he said that  to stay? 
A: Oh, yes .  He di dn't list en.  
You can only s pec ul ate on what coul d ha ve happene d i f he had st aye d  
on wi th us . 

Q: He had and showed
 you plans for the rehabilita
tion of Budapest or the he
lping of people after the 
war;  is  that ri ght?  

A: Ya. 

Q: Wh at did this entail? 

A: Well, you see, this also I thi
nk contributed to the suspicions, th
e Russia n s' suspici ons beca use he  
very proudly he told them
 the story about the future here now 
will be that I, Sw
edish diplomat and 
all that , I a m  goi ng t o sta y on and I a m goi ng t o r e organiz e thi s huma nit ari an acti on.  I 'm goi ng t o  

see to it that the fa
mily will be reunited.  
That the property is
 put back to the Je
wish people, and all 
that and so on.  And 
some author has said that 
he was politically naive.  A
nd my answer to that is 
wer en't we a ll very nai ve , the whol e we stern worl d?
  I mean, we accept ed 
the Soviets because they 
helped to defe at the Nazis.  
And when I came home to Sweden, 
when I told the people that I'm 
compl etel y convinc ed tha t  the Soviets  had arrest ed
 Raoul, that how could you say things like that  
about the Soviets, our gr eat hel per? 
 The y ha ve helpe d us t o defeat
 the Nazis, t he Nazi  system and 

all that a nd so on.  An
d t he whole we stern world 
said the sa me  thing till 19
48, at least, until Prague 
situation then.  So we al
l thought -- we  thou
ght  ours elves a s  soon as  th
e  Soviet s a rri ve, we will  
reesta blis h our e mba ss y here .  We wi ll conti nue ou
r work.  Ne ver ha ppene d.  They didn't wa nt an y 
forei gners to remai n on t he territory whi ch they 
wer e goi ng t o occ upy.  So all the e m bassi es were 
take n a w ay l i ke t hat .   

Q: Let me go back a little bit ag
ain.  Between October 
15th and December afte
r Christmas 
when it 
bec o mes real ly i mpossibl e to do ver y much e xce pt  to save ones elf, how is it  that you or Wa llenber g

fi nd out t hat  a partic ular  action is going to happ
en someplace and 
that he goes t o t r y and sa ve  
people?  I mean, how do thes
e messages get trans
mitted so that you know where to go? 
A: We ll, you know thi s big orga ni
za tion he had wa s, of cour se, c ons
isted also of younger sort of 
boys, whate ver, and wer e running be twe en t he di ff
er ent offices.  And they 
had t he i n for mati on from 
-- we - -  I  a m  sur e t hat Ra oul  Walle nberg ha d t hat. 
 Ther e wer e n't  so many of
 these railway stations;  
there were one or two only.  I a m convinc ed tha t
 the -- and yes , I know th
at he ha d some pe ople  
there who obser ved t he situati on a nd report ed i m me diat
ely to him.  So that wasn't such -- Budapest 
isn't  t hat big a cit y, so t he y c oul d bic y cle bac k 
to him or whatever.  It
 wa sn't complic ate d, no. 
Q: We re thi n gs like thi s done onc
e a day, more t han that when he 
would go out?   I mean, what ki nd  
of sit uati on are we talki ng about  
wh en we  tal k a bou t n o
t si mply sa ving peopl e by giving t he m the  
pass es whic h are obviously ver y signi fica nt, bu
t  also goi ng out  and doi ng s o met hing, whi ch was  
what wa s unusual, whe n you a nd 
he we nt out  or  he we nt  out?  
A: Well , it  was all  certainly a co mbi n
ation of all this that 
he - -  fi rst, we had t he prot ecti ve  pa ssports . 
The pe ople l odged i n our  houses , that 's one t hi ng. 
 But once tha t  was done , i t
 was the question to try 
to save more people than that.  
And also to find if by chance 
some people without a passport had 
bee n de port e d or wer e on the way t o  be deported, 
you see.  So that became
 a routine in a way to 
check on  that when the trains  we
re leaving for Auschwitz
 or t h e death mar c hes 
later on, of course. 
So that  was compl e ment ary t o t his fi rst mor e or 
l ess organiz e d sa ncti on by the governme nt a nd all  
that; that wa s one thi ng.  The other thi ng was to try to -- I had hope d to hel p people who wer e on the  
wa y to be  deport ed and then co
me s, of c our se, t he big ri sky ope ration whi ch Raoul  Walle nber g  
didn't for m hi msel f, but  indire ctly
 through his  pr esence. 
 You see, it 's al so 
interesting with Raoul 
Wa llenberg which is very well describe
d by Levi in the firs
t book whi ch a ppe ared 
just after the war. 
He says something like that Raou
l Wa llenber g beca me  the obs ervi ng e y e, so t o sa y, whi ch -- t h e 
conscience.  He became ki
nd of a something which th
e Nazis feared i n
 a wa y tha t  hi s me re pre senc e  
stopped them fr om going s
till further in a way someti me
s.  And an exam
ple of that is, of course, that 
when one of the collabor a
tors, I don't think that 
Raoul  Walle nberg was pre sent hi ms el f, hear d t ha t  
the Hungari an officer s wer e 
going to blow up the wh
ole , so to sa y, i nter national - - our hous es i n

their despera tion beca use  they c oul dn't de port a ny 
people any longer becaus
e, you see, they wer e  
just being encircled by the Russians.  Then he 
took upon hi m to s a y in Ra oul 's wor ds that Ra ou l  
Wa llenber g is se ndi ng a  messa ge to you, Ge ner a l 
Sc hmitthuber (ph), who wa
s the last remaining 
ar my ge nera l.  I mea n, not SS, but the ar my ge nera
l in Budapest .  "If you 
don't stop this action 
which the Hungarian offices are plan
ning, I'll see to it that you 
will be hanged as 
a war criminal 
after the war."  And then th
e ge neral  s topped thi s a ction;  70,000 pe opl e i n t h e ghett o. 
Q: What do you think they were
 ac tually i nte ndi ng, ma chi ne- gunn
ing people or  bombi ng it or doe s 
anyone know? 

A: Well , t her e were  both, 
I think.  Putting the fire
 and then shooting the m. 
Q: So this was an inte
rmediary who calle
d this ge neral and said this? 
A: No, no.  So t hat -- in
 Ric hard Cha mberl ain's fil m, the y ha ve
 -- it 's more dra mat ic, of course . 
Raoul Wallenberg is running to 
Schmitthuber (ph) and 
telling all that.  It 
never happened, but 
anyhow it doesn't ma ke  a  di ff
ere nce  be caus e t he pe ople  were  sa ved thanks t o his na me . 
Q: This is rather extrao
r d inary that one pe rson would ha ve suc h
 a n i mpact .  Whe n you kne w hi m a s  
a younger ma n, would you ha
ve bee n able t o predict that he woul d have s uch inge nuit y and 
initiative and a kind of 
fearlessness in such a difficult situation? 
A: No, I don't t hink s o.  
I think he grew with the 
task, as we all do, I th
ink.  That he -- I ' m not 
astonished at  all t hat he
 became that  kind of a pe
rson.  He -- we a
ll came into a situation where we 
thought that this is going
 to be  a  fowl coupl e of 
mont hs and kind of re all y
 had a cross section of 
people we sa ved and so on.  I don'
t t hi nk t hat we e ver thought  of -- 
first of all, we 
never thought of 
the danger we were 
in.  And the second 
thing is we  never th
ought of the  di mensi ons  -- t h e enor mous  
di mensions i t  would ta ke ; I mean, the  magnit ude of 
this operation.  We were
 not drea mi ng of that.  
Ra oul Walle nber g in a way was forc e d int o an ope
ration whi c h be ca me much bigger t han he e ver  
thought of.   

Q: Did t he other le gati ons -- bec aus e other l egat i ons ra
n sa fe hous es als o --  did they al s o ha ve s uch 

a lar ge sta ff, do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
44 
 
A: No, they didn't .  The y  had a lso
 Je wis h volunte ers and all t h at.  
Of c ours e, the Swi ss wer e the ne xt 
biggest , but  t he other wer e the s ma ll a ctions
, the Portugue se  and t he Spani s h a nd s o on. 
Q: Di d you know Györ gyi Polas ka  
(ph) from the Spanish sector? 
A: We ll, I don't know -- well, I 
hear d his na me many t i mes now a nd 
so on.  And he wa s  the Spanis h 
sort of chargé d'affaires
, t hey c a lled hi m.  He c a lle d hi ms el f an
 a mbas sa dor , I think.  Li ke  Hunga rian  
Count  Pongr as ( ph) , whom I kne w  ve ry well , he c a
lled hims elf Ambassador of
 Portugal .  Of c ours e,  
when those a mbas sa dors  left , they gave over ev
erythi ng t o locall y e mpl oye d pe ople ,  whic h the y  
kne w, so the y t ook over .  And it
's interesting to see how in the 
docume nts  whi ch als o a r e pr oduce d  
in Levi 's book whe n we  ma de 
joint interventions for 
the government, they 
wer e si gne d by _______, 
my boss , by Lutz  (ph), or  Felle r 
(ph) wa s my opposite , a young  
_______, Co unt Pongras (ph) and 
so on, Amb assa dor  of Spa i n.  An
d so there were al ways a sort 
of a joint -- ve
ry often joint 
interventions from th
e ne utral countri es. 
Q: Can you expl ain what  
that mea ns for pe opl e who don't know
 what t hat me ans when you s a y "a  
joint intervention"? 

A: We ll, that we all go together. 
 I me an, that we go t ogethe r , the fo
ur or  three or four or five, t he  
neutr als pr es ente d -- go t oget her to the foreign offi
ce and prese nt a pape r signe d by all of us t hat w e  
prote st a gainst this a ction you ha ve ta ken a gai nst 
whate ver, our national s 
or agai nst pe ople under  
our  pr otecti o n a nd s o on. 

Q: In those  s ituati ons , 
you present  a document? 
A: Oh, yes.  Oh , yes. 

Q: Is t her e t h en a disc ussi on or  is it s i
mply a for mal pr esen
tati on and t he n . . . 
A: Oh, well , it could be followe d by discus si
ons, of course, at th
e same time.  Yes. 
Q: But a very forma
lized kind of . . . 
A: Well, Raoul Walle
nberg was often initiated to th
is, of course, and so on. 
Q: So he someti mes  was  part  of t h
e discussions in 
the interventions?  
A: Oh, ya, ya. 

Q: And di d he act  di ffere ntly t han t h
e r est of you i n thos e s ituat i ons?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
45 
 
A: Beg your  pardon?  
Q: Di d he a ct di ffe r entl y in t hose s ituati ons or
 wa s he acti ng i n a dipl
omatic fashion in those  
interventions? 

A: No.  Well , it wa s di ffe rent dependi ng on the sit ua
tion, you see.  There wa
s no speci al  -- you can't  
say the re wa s a ny special  rule s for 
how t o act .  You al ways  ha d t o a d
opt yourself after the situation 
and i mpr ovise and all t hat . 

Q: Talk to me a little bit about ne
utrality and what that 
means and what 
you felt given all that you 
sa w a bout your  gover n ment 's own ne utralit y. 

A: Well, you see, the neutrality 
is a conc ept which has be en ver y
 much dis cus se d, of course , 
especiall y now i n Sweden in t his
 c o mpletel y ne w sit uati on t oda y.  
But neutrality for us during the 
war wa s, of cour se, t hat we tri ed not to take sides ,  
not to be i n the middle .  
A very egot i stical sort of 
polic y t hat  you t ry t o save your  li
fe , your own country.  
That 's perhaps quit e nat u
ral in a way, and so 
on, but ne ut rality spea ki ng of the t i me duri ng t he wa
r , of c ourse, i f you are smart and you ha ve 
adapted a little bit, changed it a little
 bit.  So I think th
at the Swedish governme
nt was very anxious 
towards the end of the war to be 
more pro-allied than they were ju
st at the beginni
ng of the war .  
And t hat 's no longer, I 'm not
 -- no one should be asto
nis hed a bout that kind of
 a situation.  So fro m 
havi ng ha d give n in for the Ger ma ns  in the be ginnin
g whe n we didn't know i f
 they were going to 
invade us or not, 
it was permitting trains with 
soldiers through Sweden, 
German soldiers and all 
that, and del i vering ir on ore to t he m
 and s o on.  At the 
ti me we di mini sh ed a
ll this like that, so 
towards t he  end of the  war we  di dn't give  th
e Ger mans any favor whatever.  We were mor e  
favor abl e towar ds t he all i ed countrie
s  and so on.  And I ' m su
re that that was also
 part of our -- well,  
the political, it was.  Of c
ourse, hu manitarian.  Of c
ourse, this was he
lp fo r the Jewish
 people, but I 
think it was well in line with our 
pol i cy towar ds the end of the wa
r that we show up.  Look here,  
what we ha ve done for y
ou.  We have helped the Je wish peopl e
, and we ha ve bee n fighting a gainst  
the Ger mans, t he Nazis in
 Hungar y, a n d all  that. 
Q: Were  you e ver upset  that  yo
ur gover n me nt had not done  more
 for  re scui ng pe opl e?   In other  
words , do you t hink t here  was  
a ti me t hat t h
ey mi ght have? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
46 
 
A: Ya , I thi n k so.  And t hat
 is very well illustrated 
by a friend of mi ne.  Hi
s na me is Ste ve Kobli k. 
Per haps you ha ve hear d about hi m;  he 's a  hi st oria
n, Je wis h hi stori an at 
the university in Los 
Angel es.  And he wr ote  a book, 
first in Swedish.  He
 speaks Swedish like 
a Swede because he's 
mar ried t o Swedish lady.  And it appeared a couple 
of years later, the same
 book in Englis h.  It 's  
called "I f the  Stones Cr y Out ."  It 's
 fr om t he Bi ble , that i f you are silent -- you c an't ke ep that sile nt  
because the stones will cry out
, is fr om Jesus, sort of
 a chapter in the Bible. 
 And he wrote that book 
and that is just aboutthe Swedish situation towa
rds t he Je wi sh people 
in Swe den bet wee n 1930-
something when the Nazis 
started off in Germany till the end of 
the war.  Wh ere he tells us who  
doe sn't know it -- I kne w it, of c our se -- and t he Swi
ss wer e in the sa me boat.  How we had no vis a  
wit h Ger ma ny.   T he Ge r ma ns co
uld fr eely come to Sweden wit h
out vi s a.  And t he n the  Swi s s  
governme nt and t he Swe dish gover n
me nt as ke d the Ger ma ns , "But 
how do we know if there are 
any Je wis h people a mong those people?
"  "Well, we'll see to it that 
t hey put a J i n the  pass port."  
And those peopl e were s t opped a t  
the bor ders of Switzerl and, the 
borde r s of Swe de n, beca use t he  
Swedi sh t r ade uni ons, t he  Swedish 
doctors, one special one per son 
i n t he Swe dis h gove rnment  was  
anti-Semitic.  They said 
we -- a nd the Je wish pe ople t he ms el ves 
and that is terribl
e.  The Je wish 
people i n St ockhol m sai d, " Don't let any" -- quoti
ng hi m now the whole ti me , 
as you under sta nd, in 
his book.  The y were s aying acc or ding to his wo rds t hat " For God's s ake , don't le t any Je wi s h 
people co me into Sweden because there will be 
a Jewish problem in Sweden."  You see, that  
reflects t he whole at mos pher e in Eur ope or i n the  
Unite d St ate s or where ve r  you are i n the world.  I 
mean, in Israel, In Pale
stine, they know pretty
 well what's goi
ng on.  Six m
illion people at 
Ausc hwitz a nd al l that a nd s o on.  
And t hey ha d in Isr ael t he proble
m t o create t he st at e.  To creat e 
the State of Israel, they wanted to be on good 
terms with the British, and the British were in the  

dilemma that they di
dn't wa nt to have too ma ny Jewish pe
ople coming t o  Palesti ne because t here 
would be c onflict with t h e Ara bs .  Thi s is poli cy 
the whole time, th
e whole ti me , see , whi ch stopped  
the pos sibili t y of taki ng i n mor e Je wi sh people at th
at time to Pales
tine.  So i f you as k and I 'm qui t e 
straight for w ard to you i n this que sti on, bec aus e I 
think t hat t he whole world, the whole worl d i s  
guilty in this situation.  And how 
then he de scri bes t hen how we c o
mes further in t his sit uati on.

When the war breaks out , Sweden 
wa s in a very gr eat danger to be occupie d  by the Ger m ans .  1942,  
when we re porte d t hat 
the gas chambers existed and wh en 
Roosevelt  got t he same r eport i n 
Ameri ca, t here was great anti- Semiti
c fe elings he re , so ther e wa s not publi shed at all anyt hing fr om 

the gover n ment a bout t h ese gas  cha mbers .  Swe den, 
the sa me thing.  But if
 I talk about Sweden, I 
think we c ould ha ve s ort of br ou
ght out this to the public in, say, 
i n 1943, when yo
u could see that  
the war is not going to be  won by t he Ger ma ns , a n d 
after Stalingrad and all th
at and s o on.  And as 
Kobli k sa ys  in hi s book, he  mea ns that i f Sw
e d en, a neutra l  countr y, or  Switze r land, a neutr al 
country, would ha ve published in bi g headli ne s wh
at 's going on, it  woul d perha ps  ha ve give n t he  
Ger ma ns sec ond t houghts .  That th
e y would ha ve not st op
pe d, but sl owed down thi s whole acti on. 
And above  all, he  sa ys in his 
book it would ha ve given the  Je wi
sh people an information fr om 
neutral countries, where they must
 tel l  the trut h, a fte r all, about this a nd woul d per ha ps  have given  
the Jewish peopl e a more f
eeling t o re sist.  You mi ght t ake  all t h
is what I ha ve t old you now, I ' m not  
sayi ng t hat it 's my opi nion at all lik
e that, but I thi nk it 's ver y i ntere
sting that an American aut hor , an 
Ameri can hi storian put s for war d all  these ar gu
me nts  her e  agai nst t he whole  worl d whi c h di d  
not hing t o he lp. 

Q: Di d you t hink t here  c o uld ha ve  be e n 
more Je wi sh r esist ance  in Hungar y?  
A: I f t here  c oul d have be en?  

Q: Coul d the r e have  been more  J e
wis h re sista nce?   We re you . . . 

A: I me an, I don't know.  In Po
la nd they were fi ghti ng t o war ds th
e end.  The r e might  have be en  
other situations, I don't 
know.  That's only very
 political.  What would ha
ve happened if they had  
attacked t he ghett o i n Budapest li ke t hey attack
e d  the ghet t o i n War sa w?   Woul d t he Hungaria ns  
have ma de  t he sa me  resi stan
ce there?   I don't know. 

Q: You've probably heard the de
bat e a bout bomb
ing Ausc hwitz . 
A: Ya. 

Q: Do you think that had Auschwit
z been bombed, that th
ese Hungarians 
would have been killed in 
Ausc hwitz?   I mea n, what  di d you t h
ink about the argume nt about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
48 
 
A: I t hink t h at 's  -- it  was the Head
 of t he War Li be rty Board who initi
ated or pr opose d
 this.  And not 
onl y bombing, above 
all  bombing t he  line s bet wee
n Buda pest  a nd Aus chwit z, 
so he  was  very act i ve  
in suggesting this.  The an
s wer wa s and that is, of cours e, ver y 
much because of t he Soviet atti tude  
because the allies were very -- ther
e was a great similarity with the 
Soviets because they were, after 
all, hel ping t o -- t he y wer e sa ving Brit ish or Amer i
can lives in 
putting in so much 
force themse lves. 
So i f t he Rus sians said no, we are 
not in war just to protect the Jewi
sh people , we vet o tha t .  And we  
have no ti me , we ha ve our airpl ane
s for ot her  purposes , na mel y , to kill
 Ger ma ns , a nd that 's not at all  
for t his pur pose you s uggest , they
 told them, see.  An
d I thi nk t hat 's a t errible  thi ng bec aus e it  
wouldn't ha ve c ost t he m more t ha n one or t w o 
bombs  to throw down on 
these connection lines.  
That woul d have stoppe d, at l east t hey woul d ha
ve sa ved hundre ds of thousa nds of pe opl e just  
stopping that  deport ation.  So that 's terrible , but it
's very ea sy a l so, of c our s e, a fter war d to sit down  
there  and s a y you s hould ha ve done t hat a nd you sh
ould ha ve  done t hat.  One 
re ally has t o al so t ry 
to see it how was the real situation 
a nd s o on.  So it 's ver y di ffi c
ult to judge, but
 from the outside 
like this, I think it was a gr
eat  mistake not at least  to bomb t he 
conne ction l i nes  withi n Buda pest  a nd 
Auschwitz.  I think that wo
uld have helped a lot to 
save ma ny people's lives. 
Q: You, in an interview at Upps
ala, commented on a question that 
a fil m ma ker had a ske d you t ha t  
had one of you returned from Bu da
pe st, not  just Raoul  Wall enberg, 
what do you th
ink wo uld have  
bee n the feel ings , the understa ndi ngs of what ever
ybody di d?   I think the qu
esti on has s o methi ng to  
do wit h whe n one pers on is t ake n a nd other people
 wh o have also done ma
ny thi ngs  ca me bac k,  
does that enlarge the reputati on 
of Ra oul Wall e nber g, beca use 
he was the one who obviously  
suffered after the war in a way 
that the rest of you didn't. 
A: We ll, I think that the mere f
act t hat we all s t ood up behi nd 
Ra oul  Wallenber g, and even i f we  
wer e not -- e very pers on wer e not e ngage d 100 per
cent like Raoul Wallenberg 
in sa vi ng people like  
that, at least  at the begi nning we
 had so ma ny ot her t hings t o  
do, a nd we  wer e wor ki ng day and 
night, es pec i ally be fore he ca me, of c ours e.  But 
a fte r he ca me , for me, t he  ma i n task wa s to ke ep 
this together.  I me an, it coul d have ea sily ende d up
 in a big ca tastrophe if 
he made mi s t akes which  
would have, aft er all, fr us trated th
e Germans that much that they wo
uld st opped eve r yt hing, you se e.

k beca us e that  we had t his big orga niza tion,  
beca use  we  had an e mba ssy 
with a reputation of bein
g correct  and that and ha
ving the relations with 
Ger ma n y and all that , Ra oul Wall enbe
rg with all what he di d and s o on, he coul d ne ve r have ac ted 
on hi s own a l one , never .  So e ve n i f he and eve r
y pers on didn't  do the sa me  
job a s he di d, the mere  
fact t hat  he was t here, 
t h at the embassy was t her e, t hat was t h
e whole  ba s e for  his acti on, you s ee. 
So we bot h helped ea ch other i n one  way or a
nother as much as we c
ould.  So, I mean, did t he  
que stion you as ked wa
s -- I don't . . . 
Q: Well , I think what the  fil m ma
ker wa s aski ng wa s if all of you ha
d bee n caught by the Russi ans , 
as you we re , you t hen we
r e se nt back.  I f all 
of you had bee n ca ught  
and not  se nt bac k, woul d 
ever yone 's r eput ation ha ve been di
fferent?  Would there be t his -- i n
 ot her words, t her e is a way in 
whi ch pe opl e under stand the s ituati o n in Budape st as
 one he ro, and tha t 's cl
ear l y not  how it was .  
Bec ause al one Ra oul Wallenber g could not  ha ve  possibl
y ha ve done wha t  he did, ri ght?   So I t hi n k 
his que stion to you ha s to do w
ith t he reasons why t he 
reputation is so much
 larger than other 
people's. 

A: Ya.  Well , I think I underst an
d what you me an.  And, of course
, suppos e that nobody had c o me 
back.  Of course, st
ill Raoul Wallenberg woul
d have got most of the cred
it.  Of course, he did the 
job mor e tha n we did, but I think 
t hat  we would have been re c ogniz
e d also for being hi s suppor ter s  
and the base for his acti o n.  I t hink especiall y i n 
t he perspecti ve perhaps no
t the first day after the  
disc ove ry, but in a pers pective now 
wit h all his t orians l ooking to this , I thi nk they woul d ha ve toda y 
to say that today we would still be there somewher
e or killed or died.  To
day, they would have  
anal yzed t he situati on, and t hey
 would ha ve  come  t o t his co
ncl u sion, as I t ol d you.   
Q: Were you a balance for hi m, bot h as a person
 and as representing a more -- well , the Swedish 
Emba ss y be caus e  he wa s  not trai ne d as a di ploma t ?   
He wasn't  coming ther e 
to be a di pl omat.  Wa s 
there a way i n 
which you . . . 
A: Ya, of course, that was part of
 my  job to balance between -- of 
cours e, when he  
came first, the 
other st a f f, I me an, the ot her pe opl e in the e mbas sy, for the m it wa s a very st range situat i on.  Here 's  

an outsider c o ming and he takes ove r and he acts on hi s own, and t his is being a n ar ms oper ation

and what's  going on her
e?  I reme mb er when I ca
me ba ck from Stockhol m i n
 August, I 'd bee n home  
wit h my wi fe and all t ha t  and ca me  bac k wit h so
me mo re people, ______ 
and so on for hel ping, 
Ast a Ni else n.  Walle nber g ha d alrea d y bee n in a c
t i on then for a mont h whe n
 I ca me .  And the whol e  
embassy building was filled with 
Jewish applicants in the gard
en and all over, and he was  
distri buti ng pass ports t o all of the 
pe ople .  And t he sta f f were  upset ,
 and I said, "Now
, take it easy, 
take it easy.  I'll talk to Ra
oul a bout this ."  And whe n he h
ear d my ar gume nts ,
 he  unders tood 
completely what I was aimi ng at; na mely, that if 
we now est ablis hed a bi g resc ue ope ration i n t h e  
embassy here along those lines you 
are thinking of, we will not ha
ve any possibility to act as an 
e mbas sy any longer wit h  our ordinar y wor k, and 
we won't be recognized 
any longer  as the Oder 
(ph) Swedish Embassy.  We will be 
a big rescue kind of 
station here, so, please
, now, you have to  
orga nize  thi s  anothe r wa y.  And he  underst ood i m me
diate l y what I  was  ai mi ng
 at.  So he had these  
vol unte er pe ople and the y est ablis he d his office on th
e Pe st si de a nd so on. 
 So the whole sit uati on 
cal med down.  And then 
after that, the wh ole staff comp lete
ly understood the situation and 
especiall y when I continue
d my di sc ussi ons wit h Ra oul
 and said, "You have to 
stick to these criteria  
the whole  ti me  be ca use  we  ha ve  to have vi s-á- vi
s the Ger ma ns a correct  bureaucr acy for what we 
are doing.  And we c an't 
give a way prote ctive pa ssp
orts to anyone like that, at least not now in the  
begi nni ng when everyt hi ng 
is comparativel y cal m her e and we ca
n work in all quiet," and all that 
and so on.  Whic h di dn't
 prevent hi m, of course
, t owards the end when ev
e r ythi ng was fal ling int o  
piece s and a ll the bombi ng a nd all t h
at that he coul d di stribute pr ote ctive pas ses t o anyone he  
wa nte d to he lp.  That was  the ne
xt situation whe n you c oul dn't l o
se a nythi ng on doi ng t h at.  But  the  
whole start, it was absolutely nece
ssary to make that al
ong as corr ective lines
 as possibl e.  As  
correct as possibl e. 
Q: And he had no troubl e  under sta
ndi ng that  there  had to be . . . 
A: Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.
  He understood it comp
letel y.  So, but  that was 
a part of my  diplomatic 
traini ng, a nd he bei ng a  clever  busi ness ma n ma king 
busine ss  and all t hat , you s ee, in his wa y of 
acting.

Q: How did you understa nd his  pa ssi on
 fo r wanting to come 
over to Budape st to 
sa ve Je ws?   Di d he  
ever  explai n what --  it 's not t h
e most  usual  de cisi on to make. 
A: No, I  underst ood it i n a wa y. 
 I underst ood i t  bec aus e I kne w 
from years before in Stockhol m 
when we we re bot h young 
and a ll tha t  that he al ways st ood 
up for young peopl
e who wer e  ba dly  
treated by their comrades an
d all that.  And in the m
ilitary service also
, we were together there.  He  
always st ood up for we aker people, and he al so ha d thi s kind of ent husi as m for he lping a nd idea s  
and inventiveness and all  that .  So 
fr om that I understood
 in a wa y --  unde r sto
od it, perhaps not 100 
perce nt.  That I under s
ta nd now muc h bett er whe n
 I'm readi n g -- I read t h
e letters bet ween hi m and 
his gr andfat her wher e you se e ho
w his charact er  devel ops and ho
w he comes here to the United 
States and he studies at Michi gan Univer sity a
nd how he wholehear tedl y accept s the Ameri can way  
of li fe, t he fr eedom, de mocrac y and i ntegri t y of ma
n and all that.  And with
 those i m pressions, he 
then comes to Hällefors wh
ere he meets the first  Je
wi sh r e fuge es, a nd I 'm a bsol utel y c o nvi nce d that  
when he  sa w this , t hat  the y were  unhe ard of stori es , th
at he sai d  to hi ms el f, " I
 ha ve to do somet hing. 
Absol utel y, I  can't be passive.  I 
have  t o do s o met hi ng for helpi n g." 
 And then it so ha
ppened that he  
comes t o St ockhol m and 
works with a Jewish businessman th
ere , and he get s the story from 
Buda pest  what 's  ha ppeni n g t her
e and so on an
d so on.   
Q: Wh en you helped Mr. Wall (ph)
 who c a me to s ee you t hat night
, would you sa y 
that your -- not 
appreciation of the problem -- but 
your decisi on t o hel p c a me  fr om 
hi m c o ming to tha t  door, an d 
then you -- s ort of the door woul d not  close a nymore 
in a c erta i n way?   Thi s wa s not a plan i n your  
hea d t hat you wer e goi ng to go
 out  and s ave  the Je ws  eit her?  
A: No, bec a use it  ca me  t hat e arly, 
s o I ha dn't fac e d the  sit uation real
l y.  But  he desc ribe d it to me, of 
cour se, a nd t he followi ng da ys we 
s a w it .  We  sa w ho w th ey wer e  q u
euing up outside. 
 We  sa w  t h a t  
this is very serious.  Absolutely.  So that's no
 doubt how you ge
t more a n d mor e invol ved in t his , 
how it  gr ows and al l tha t .  And 
I was asked in Philade
lphia when I was there in November , we 
disc uss ed at the s y mposi u m or what
ever what characteri zed a humanita
r i a n.  That is r eally not  an 
easy question to answer, you know
.  So I could only exemplify 
it by telling the st
ory about Raoul  
Wa llenber g and sa yi ng t hat I think 
in Raoul Wall enberg's case, he 
was born huma nitarian in a way, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
52 
 
beca use  he  had t hese  feel ings  for al ways hel ping i n
 sc hools .  He hel ped th
e weaker chi ldren there 
who were terrorized by the 
stronger ones a nd all t hat, a nd it 's al
so interesting that
 this one man who 
wa s wit h hi m -- his na me now was Pleti (ph) or so
methi ng -- who was wit h Ra oul Wa l l enberg in t h e 
car whe n t h ey were  g oi
ng t o ________ and Ra oul 
disa ppea red.  And he sa
id just as they were 
leavi ng "Oh, no, I can't fo
llow you because I don't k
now wher e my parents are 
now.  I have to fin d  
them."  So he left the car and save
d his life, of course , in doing that .  And he tol d the s t ory that the y  
met, they knew each other fr om 
the begi nni ng fr om pri or ye ars in Switz erland wher e they we r e  
studying at the same school an
d this little Pleti (ph) was a sma
ll little boy, Jewish, weak, and how 
the older  pe ople , t he st r onger bo
ys, they were t e rrorizi ng hi m.  
An d then Raoul Wa llenberg went 
straight up t o hi m and s aid, " D on
't be a frai d.  I ' ll prote ct you."  So he protect ed hi m against the  
other s, you see.  So ha ving heard all  these st orie
s, I ca me to the conclusi on that he was bor n the  
humanitarian in a way, and I told
 t he audience that.  
And if you apply that 
on other people on 
mysel f a nd s o on, I don't call me 
humanitari an.  But if you would 
call me humanitaria
n, I woul d say  
that I became that when I was facing the situati o n.  Th
at I di dn't have sort of -- I wasn't born that 
way, I don't think so.  I can't ju
dge mysel f , but we all who have 
faced the situatio
n like that, how 
coul d you ha ve done  nothing?   
I  me an, you ha d t o, you had to. 
Q: Wh en you we nt back
 -- you were  kept  for wha t, a  mont
h, two mo nths by
 t he Russi a ns?  
A: Ya, we were kept, say, from the beginn
ing of February till the 
beginning of April. 
Q: How were you treated? 

A: We ll.  Correct.  And that was 
also the peculiar situation that 
the Soviet s ha d t wo ar mie s.  One  
ar my oc cupi ed Pe st, t hat wa s the Mar shal or Ge ne
ral Madde nows ky ( ph) a n d conquere d Pest i n one  
mont h be for e  they took over , the Ru
ssians took over Buda.  In Buda was anot her ge ne ral, his na me  
wa s Turbuchon ( ph) , and they didn't 
see eye-to-eye; they were rivals
.  So they ne ver c o mmunic ate d  
bet wee n t he ms elve s, see .  And on t he Buda side, 
we ha d no si gns  of be
ing out helping Jewi sh 
people .  We  had no houses with Swedis h fla gs on
 and all t ha t .  But M addenows ky ( p h) whe n he  
ca me to Budapest , e ver y second hous e were hang
i ng a Swe dis h flag, a nd 
peopl e going around wit h  
Swedi sh pa s sport s.  So a ppar entl y he  beca me  firs t 
ver y, ver y fr ustra t ed an
d annoye d a bout all t his  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0301  
53 
 
and s o on, and he said the Swedes  mus t  be ve ry
 suspicious people and all that.  So he never  
communica t ed t o Tur buchon ( ph)  a
nd say, " L ook, here, i f you se e 
any Swedes there, take  them. 
Arrest them."  Be cause -- and at 
our side there were no signs that we
 ha ve done anyt
hi ng but being a  
Swedi sh E mbass y.  I  think t hat expl
ai ns per haps why t he y di dn't brin
g us , ta ke  us  to prison.  The y 
arrested us, t hey interred us, and 
t hey had us  under  a gu
ar d for a coupl e of mont
hs.  But then they 
deci ded to s e nd us  home  t o Sweden co
ntrar y t o what ha
ppened to Ra oul. 
Q: And the r esponse of t h e 
Swedi sh gover n me nt i n tr ying t o get Raoul  ba c k?  
A: Ya.  Th en, of course, 
they lost  so much time  
when they t hough
t the whole time 
that Ra ou l was 
under thei r protecti on.  And thi s is als o an int erest ing st ory how code d doc u ment s whic h have not  
bee n found, you know, te lls the st or
y how he was arreste d -- no, first 
of all ,  how the for eign office i n  
Mosc ow a cc ordi ng to i ns t ructi ons  which al l forei gn offic es i n  the worl d 
wer e followi ng; na me ly, 
the Swe dish gover n me nt  ha d be for e the war , be fore
 t his ha ppened i n Hungar y, gi ve n a list  to the 
forei gn offi c e with all our na me s.  And sa ying 
if you mee t  these pe opl e, take t he m  under your  
protection because they are Swedes, Swedi sh di plom
at s.  So i mmediat el y 
when the Soviet ar my 
found Raoul  Wallenber g, accor d
ing t o the i nstr uctions t hey repor t ed back to t he foreign office.  And  

so they called for t he Swed
is h Amba s sador a nd t h ey tic ked off Ra oul
 Wall enberg, he 's sa fe.  He is?  
Oh.  And t h en the y wer e happy, but  they had not
 heard a word about us, 
you see .  So in Sweden 
they start ed t o wonder  and as ked, " What has happene
d to t he others? "   The y
 thought one da y Raoul  
Wa llenberg would come bac
k, but the others?  Not till we came ho
me then in Apr
il they understood 
that now somet hing mus t  have bee n
 happe ning here to Ra oul , and th
ey st a r ted to a sk a nd s o on and 
that.  Then it 's int erest ing to as k the questi on 
how on ea rth c ould the y re
por t they ha d found Raoul  
Wa llenber g and t ell hi m that he 's under good care  and 
all that and the same ti
me arrest  hi m?   And 
that is the lack of communication then between th
e Soviet For eign Offic e a nd the KGB.  Wher e the  
KGB ha d de cide d to ar re st hi m, but t hey hadn't told
 the foreign office abou
t that.  And they became 
furious , of c ours e, when they hea r
d t h at the forei g n offi ce had alread
y t old the Swedes
 t hat they ha d 
found Raoul  Walle nberg beca use t he 
followi ng da y, the y arres t ed hi m.  We  got the mes sage on the  
16th of January, and they arre
sted hi m on t he 17t h.

Q: Di d you t hink t hat the  governm
ent of Sweden did enou
gh to try and get Ra
oul  Wall enberg back?  
A: Not t he fi rst -- I woul d say, as 
I s ay in my book, t he firs t two year
s are  the lost yea r s.  Well , o f  
cour se, t hey should have acted i n muc h force f ul wa

got t he mes s age that he wa s ther e, t h at the y ha d

ha ve pus h ed tha t .  And 
they should have demonstr
ated that, should have 
us ed muc h harder la ngua
ge and s o on, but t he y  
didn't.  They didn't.  And that is
 ver y, very sad story, a nd t hat i s 
also part of forei gn pol icy a nd all  
that.  The Soviet s ha d won the wa r.  The y were
 now goi ng to domi nate th

we ha d come closer t o t he m a s nei g hbors t han be

Q: Ma kes  you a ngr y?  

A: Oh, yes.  To
