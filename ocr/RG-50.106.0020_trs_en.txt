they arrived at the date, and overnight, they pulled out anddisappeared.  We 

didn™t know what™s going on.  Eventually (ph), thenext day, the Russian troops 

cam e in andtook over Prujena (ph).  So, you know, it was to why they 
--
 
we  
didn™t know ________secret pact.  And Poland was the____________ between

Q:W hen were you aware of the Nazi presence?

Union and Germany, because the proxim ity was so close to the border, we onl

Q:W hatare your recollectionsof f irst seeing the Nazis?
 

A:W ell, in thebeginning, when the Germ an arm y arri ved, it was 
--
 
everybody 
was inside.  You know, everybody was inside.  Andpeople were af raid to go 

out.  And we heard already, you know, it was night, we heard the radio stories 

andall that.  But youhave to gooutto get som e water.  You know, we didn™t 

have inside water, wehad to go to the well to get some waterf or the fam ilies.  

T hem anf rom f am ily had to go out to the well to get some water.  So that, you 

know, som e Germ answere washing around there.  And it was not ‚til 
--
 
i t  wa s  
not any 
--
 
I don™t recallany special eventshappened while they were

while the 
f ront went through.  But, after three weeks,when thetroop moved, and then the 

Gestapo tookover, you know their city says 
--
 
we heard about, some soldiers 
usedto tell us, you know, that  well, we were war y of  them  and the successor
™s  
com ing.  Beware of the accessors com ing.  It means they were telli ng you that

three weeks when thef ront, when_______________and the SS Gestapo cam e 
in toaccom plish their.  .  .  So I recall whathappened I think in the f irst, first 

days, what they did is they requestedor they pickedup I think it™s eleven Jews, 

representativesf rom different groups.  T hey asked, you know, if you were ever a 

presidentf ora synagogue or if  som ebody charteredfor organization.  And if  you 

were in charge at some timef orany Zionist organization, we had the patriot, we 

hadthe Bund (ph) organization, you know.  Andpresidents and so, so they 

pickedup some intellectuals andthey took him  out,I know this,by the littlefor
e st  
that™sabout three kilom etersf rom  Prujena (ph).  Lachi (ph), lachia(ph) 

__________.  And that they shot him .  Thatwas thef irst days __________ f irst 

days thatthey took control.
 
Q:W hat were yourf eelings at this tim e, seeing all this happen?
 
A :  Af
te r tha t?
 
Q: Yeah, while this was happening, what wer e your feelings?
 
A:W ell, we heard that 
--
we were scared.  W e were scared,but it was 
--
 
the 
ghetto was not established yet.  W e were livi ng am ong, you know,along with the 

Christians, all that.  And so,
 
lif e was going on and we were outside trading yet 
with the Christianfarmers and all thatfor awhile.  Andeventually, it didn™t take 

ver y long, that they established the ghetto.  It was, I think, in August or 

September, they established the ghetto.
 
Q: In
 
1941?
 
A: 1941.  Septem ber,‚41, they established, already, the ghetto.  And they

called those Jews who  lived in the ghetto remained.  Those Jews 
--
 
we li ved 
outside, you know, on the outside.  So we eventually had to abandon andmove 
in with one of thefam ily.  So after establishing the ghetto, there is some 
--
 
they 
extend and__________ certain laws were f or eff ect (ph).  Andf irstthing I recall 

thatthey requested, like, I think it™sbecauseof the Russians, it™s sort of  Russian 

m oney, but ____________ 
in rubles.  They requested I think it™s like a certain 
am ount kindof .  T hey think it™s they have kilogram  of  goldand two kilogram s 

silver throughout the f irst three days; sothe ghetto was established.  .  .
 
Q: T his was f rom  the town they requested this 
gold and the 
--
 
it was f rom the 
town, f rom the Jews in the town.
 
A: From the Jews, yeah.  That™salready the law.  T he Gestapo,the 

Bergerm eister,the mayor of  the city was already here, you know.  T hem ayor 

cam e in andthe Gestapo andthey toldthe Jews of  the ghetto to select aunirat 

(ph).  T hey didn™t install the unirat (ph).  I mean, you install aunirat(ph)f or 

representationf rom alldifferent branches.  So if  we gonnadeal with you, we 

need labor,f or instance, orm oney, anything like that.  Inside
 
you control Jews, 
inside the ghetto.  Policef orce, Jewish police.  So unirat (ph) was established 

throughout the way when the ghetto was established.  Ithink it was over 12 or 

15 people representing the unirat (ph), although we had ____________ wanting 

charge of  the 
--
 
especially labor was im portant, you know, and they 
--
 
right awa y 
they took youtoany type of labor work.  It was about threem ilesf rom the city 

that we hadan airport and, wintertim e especially, we neededa lotof you know 
--
 

Joseph Elman

Page

we get cold, cold winters and lots of snow.  So to clean the airports,you know, is 
500, you know, by shovels in hand.  W e[didn™t] use bulldozers and snow plows 

and stuff like that.  Solabor was im portant and each branch.  And charge 

som ebody in charge of the food,
 
you know, gets rationing established.  So 
m uch, Idon™t know exactly the rationing,butIthink there was certain rationing 

like 15or 25 gram  of bread, som uch _______ bread, they give you m argarine in 

certain am ounts.  You know, rationing was establishe
d.
 
Q: Could you tellm e som ething about 
--
 
okay, before the ghetto was being 
establishedand the unirat (ph), were Jews prohibitedf rom  public places? Like in 

Germ any?
 

A:W hen they arri ved,you mean? 
 
Q: Righ t.
 

A:W ell, it was thef irst days 
--
 
we were able, thef irst days, to go outside, 
because the ghetto wasn™t established, and go out and trade with the farmers 

because the stores were already 
--
 
the stores were closed under the Russians,to 
close.  You know, you couldn™t have on (ph).  T here was all thes
e ___________ 
storekeepers already got liquidated.  Im ean,it was sold out and closed.  So 

whatever you had hadand little, you know we knew thatthe war was gonna start, 

so each one, like over there,prepare the little food som ethingf or the future.  But
 
you were able in thebeginning to go out andtrade with thef arm ers,yet, thefirst 

days.  T his was ‚til the ghetto was established.  So I would say, m aybe, about a 

m onth that you were f ree going out.  But most of  the Jews were conf ined.  You 

Joseph Elman
 
10
 
[d a te ]
 
Page10
 
 
 
know, we were conf ined in thehouse; sitting there, youdidn™t gonowhere and 
you know, I m ean, you didn™tparticipate in any going out, like socialgoing out.  I 

recall, while the Schull (ph) 
--
 
well, as a m atter of f act, Idon™t think itwas already 
only one Schull (ph).  There were the Schulls (ph) who were already notactive 

under the Russians, already m ore so than any Schulls (ph).  Only a couple were 

left.  You know, a town, like a small town, we had six, seven synagogues.
 
Q:W hat was it like when they im posedthat the Jews were the Starof  David? Do 

you rem em ber?
 
A: Oh, well, this is when the Star of  David wa s the law when the ghetto was 

established.  T hen it cam e out, a law that you have to wear the yellow Star of  

David on both sides.  One hereand, it was yellow, certain sidesand in the back.
 
Q: Do you rem em ber if there was 
--
 
what was it like when there was destruction 
of  Jewish property by t he Nazis, or being forced outof  your hom es and 

businesses in thebeginning?
 
A: LikeI say, the home, the businesses 
--
 
there was no businesses already, 
which m ay be because the Russians, when they cam eover, they liquidated the 

business.  So there was no businesses.  Everyone was work ing, though.  It 

was norm al.  You were a chance (ph)to, you know if  you were aprof ession
a l,  

you worked with your profession.  If you were even abusinessman,say, ﬁOh, 

yeah,ﬂ when one of them  asked you if  you were abusiness man, m ight say 
--
 

when the Russian came over, m y uncle had thef lour m ill andhe was a big 

business man.  So when the Russians cameover, they told him , ﬁOkay, you 

Joseph Elman

[d a te ]
 
Page11
 
 
 
m anage, you go on.  You rem ain there.ﬂ But hedidn™town it.  T hey paid him a 
salary and that™s the way the businesses were operated,all businesses under 

Russians were liquidated andthey let you run.  T hey paid you a salary.  T hey 

didn™t come to save you f or thebusiness, though.  So when the Germ ans 

arrived, it was already in Prujena (ph), that there was not private businesses.  

T he profession, your professions, like teachers and lawyers and doctors, 

whoever  
were Je ws were, under the Russians, were able to practice their 
particular profession.
 
Q: How were you notif ied that you wouldbe going into a ghetto?
 
A: Yeah, we were notif ied.  It came thedate,I don™t know, ﬁIt™s around in 

September thatthe ghetto will be established.ﬂ  T hey calledthe Jews where they 

gave the unirat (ph), the measurementof  theghetto,the mapof  theghetto.  And 

they called them  to build, even to build afence and hold thedimensions and with 

theunirat (ph), we have topayf or it,evenf orthat.  So they were gi ven the 

instruction where it™s gonna be and all the sections, quarters, which we 

___________together.  So we knew.  And thenthey give us a time to state.  

So if  you are out of the ghetto, you™re _____________ in your home, a
n d t he  

Christians who were in the ghetto to get out.  And [we] bought theirhomes and 

we took up.  Of  course it was ver y, ver y cro wded.  T hey gi ve you af ew blocks, 

let™s see.  It was crowded, so some relatives,f am ilies of too many, just take in 

their own
 
f am ily.  W hen we m oved, we were two m ove outf rom ourhouse.  W e

Q: Could you tellm e your recollections about getting adjusted in the ghetto, living 

co
nditions?
 
A:W ell, the living conditions of the ghetto, isnow, when they establishedthe 

ghetto, in the beginning, our house was outside the ghetto.  So eventually, you 

know, had wanted tom ove in with m y aunt.  And, likeI say, it was rationing.  

And you
 
coulddoa little trading eventhough in the ghetto, you could doa little 
trading with the outside.  No, with theoutside, you denied with farmers.  And 

you know, for money,for silver, f or little, you know, if  youhad.  There really was 

a little way of  getting, Idon™t call it market, but little bribery, a littletrading.  And 

besides that, they tried to bribe the unirat (ph) in charge, tried to bribe thatm ayor, 

thebergerm eister a little.  You gave him  anything he wants,he™ll give a little 

m ore, more large the portion, the ration.  You know, there™s that.  So in the 

ghetto, in the beginning of 1941, you canm anage, nobody starved,you know.  

Actually, there was no starvation.  Buteventually, with tim e, the ghetto was 

instead of up, was, I would say, shortened, squeezed shorter and shorter and 

shorter.  And in the beginning of  1942, they started bring in som e people f rom

towns.  And that™s when the ghetto got crowded.  Andthat™s when, you know, 

the rationing, it was, the situation got worse.  T hat situation got worse.  Now, 

while in the ghetto, there was alwa ys 
--
 
e ver y day, everybody was taken to labor 
to work, different kind of places.  And certain places, you know, you
 
wo rk so ,  
som etimes, you got an extra pieceof , you know

you know, it was ver y im portant, so they gave him  abig

restarting, thinking,organizing about some kind of  resistance.  W e already knew

escapeesf rom  little towns where they toldus, you know, what happened there 

andthey just got

bya m iracle they escaped, because inthe little towns, they

there were 50f am ilies they killed and robbed

just came outand killed 
them  right on the spot.  And som ehow a survivor sur vi ved andoneof  them

when they caught some of the survi vors, whe n they caught som eof the 

s u r vi vo r s , 
they used to bring them  into the ghetto.  So I was thinking

And, eventually, when we cam e 
--
 
when we escaped 
--
 
now, the secondnight, 
we stayed, we cam e to the woods, we supposed to meet this crew because 
we™re told where they™r e gonna meet usand all that.  So we couldn™t f ind them .  
 
Q: Now, I want to goback a little.  You mentioned the escape.  Now, the 

second night, when we tried to break throughthe steel (ph), you know, we were 

followed.  Not som any, but I thinkm aybe about50people: girls, young, older 

m e n

and som eof  them  were able to go through with us.  And they sur vi ved.  
And we lost three, you know.  Eventually, took about5 m inutes, whatever, you

and 
we had two go through f irst.  Eventually, we discovered when they startedthe 

patrol that going outand we startf iring, so som e got killed.  I don™t know how 

m any, but we were able, I know, that we lost threem en.  And we were running

as long as 
you get throughand go through and get  behind thehouses andfarm houses, 

you know, in the spot so you can start running and get to getting away.  So we 

were running, yes.  And 
--
 
it wasn™t apanic 
--
 
I would say eachone was running 
different ways eventually, but we knew our destination.  W eknew where we 

were going.  W e got to reach a certainplace, and that was a village.  Andf rom

wandered aroundf ora couple days and some the group, which, you know, those 

followed us, there were couple girls that, remem ber, they said they __________.  

You know, they couldn™t take it, it™s cold, bad.  So they went back.  T hey said,

know, they said you were [going to] work.  W edidn™t know exactly a hundred 

percent, you know.  You™re going to

we didn™t know it ahundred percent.  So 
they went backand_______________.   T hat™s what I heard laterwhen I came 

back to Prujena (ph), that they got caught and though thefarm e

Germ ans, thefarmers, from the way they caught them .  T hey turned them tothe 

--
 
ga ve them  out, turn them in to the Germ ans.  I remember the Germ ans.  
T hey _____________.  So, eventually, we c aught up to the woodswith two 

other groups, each  not knowing about theother.
 
Q:W ere they Jewish groups?
 
A: Yes, inour ghetto, the sam e groups.  See, it wasn™t

be brokenup in small 
--
 
you know, in thebeginning 
--
 
eventually you can join one 
group.  SoIdidn™t 
even know aboutthis group.  So we met up with two other 
groups.  One group didn™t have

So we m et up with two  other groups.  So we™ re all together already at the time, 

c
onsisted of about50.  But theother groups

about it.  So the sled came and I

they had tof ight sohard to pay som uch money to get apistol.  And then, you
