A: Yes. My --My fath er w as exactly  the contrary, more t han the contrary. He was a 
doctor, 
M. D .
, and a very good doctor, and an extraordi nary  man. Absolutely honest and 
generous.A nd his story  is a little bit the story of many Hungarian Jews. He was born in 

1902, and -- and 1920, he wanted to start his studi es,  the university , but just in 1920 has 
been int-i ntroduce d the 
[indeci phe rable] cla usesn um erus 
clausu scl a usus
, so it means 
that, I don™t know, three percent of the students could be Jew ish, or four, I -- I -- I -- I 
don™t know . S-So h-he had to e mig rate, and he w ent to 
Germany,

 he -- he beca me a doctor.A nd as 
he ca me back, the Hungarian auth orities didn ™t recogniz e his diplo ma, and he had to start 
again. 

Q: He left 
Hungary
 to study  in 
Germ any
 because 
Hung ar y
 had more -- at that time 
more restri ctive law s?  

A: No, the 
[indeciphe rable] cla usesn um erus clausu s
 
has been introduce d, and there 
was no place, because they had I don™t know how many Jews, and he -- he has been 
refused. So he had to -- he had tolook for somewh ere -- somew he re else. And-- And so 
he -- he ma de his studies

not possi ble. So for fami ly reasons, becausemy  grandfather who m I didn™t kno w, he was 
a dentist,  and this

so me thin g like ™38. Two y ears, then he be -- he beca me independen t of the othe r -- other

man, and he didn™t see any reason  to have better food and better treat men t than  his

Jewish interests.  He --He ma de hi s work extre mely  honestly , y ou saw  the

, and I n -
- what I positive ly know, that he treated peop le having n o mo ney  atall,  and he never

He considered the -- this professio n to do somethin g necessary  for -- for his -- he --

she -- she knew that he w ill -- she will not pay, and my  father -- my  father kne w that he 

had -- can -- he cannot require -- cannot ask a ny  money  because she hadn™t. A nd so in -- 
she -- I think this -- this -- this was his -- his -- his examp ler -- exe mplary, and 

extraordinary  side, that he considered his profession as really  a profe ssion for huma n 
being s, independently of their soc ial level.  She had for i n -- He had a -- a patient who

she read a lot, and shew as very interested by plenty  of things. And it -- it couldn™t bring 
any thing, because -- because she -- she had 
to

her studies at 18. What for, I 
don™t know , because th ere was not too muc h to do. A nd I think that my  grand mother was 

very  limit ed. I don™t want the -- Idon™t w ant any  -- I -- Idon™t w ant to say  any thing bad 

of so me body who finished his -- his -- his -- her -- or somebody  -- her -- she -- who 
fi nis hed his day  in

[indeciphera ble]w hat  arrived

, because my  fathe r was on the uni -- the

quota, and I think that she didn™t want to move because of the hou se. There w as a house, 
built by her husband, the house was very beautiful, and -- and so me how I think that she 

didn™ t understand any proble m.  Meanwhile, she spoke very well, Ger man, less well

Q: Can y ou talk a little bit about the role fait h and religion play ed at ho me?  Didy our 
fa mi ly  observe the Sabbath, and in -- and in what w ay s?  
A: No, no.It™s -- I mention ed tw o friends, and religio n was an obligation in the school, as 
mathe ma tic s, or phy sics, or Hungarian literat ure. And wehad a marvelous rabbi, really  a 
marvelous ma n,  and -- who --who died the first day  in 
Auschw itz.
 He wasn™t -- He 
wasn™t old,I think he -- hew as born 1906.  So hewas 30-- 38, and -- and so some how, he 
arrived to -- to invite us to the sy nagogue, and we went regularly  to the sy nagogue,  and 

we observed --w e really observed every thing, even I think -- even the -- the day  of 

Gedarea [indec i pherable] 
thing -- thing of less i mporta nce.A nd my -- my  parents didn™ t 
say any thing, so 
they I
 consi dered 
that it 
very probably 
aswe 
--it™s so met hing which 
co mes and goes, which really happened.  

Q: By  that-- What do y ou mean by  that? Wa -- W erey our parents n ot religio us ? 
A: No. 
Q: They were not? 

A: No.N o,no, no.No,not at all. And I think my  -- my  father had avery  bad reaction 
against his father, who reg -- w how ent regula rly  to the sy nagogue, and on -- and on the 

sa me ti me, a man who -- w how as quite brut al  and tastele ss. Very  -- Very proba bly, but 
we -- w e never spoke of this,  so I -- I -- I don™t know . 

Q: What didy our parents teach y ou about being a Jew?  I mean, how  didy ou learn about 
that asy ougrew up, or what things doy ou reme mber?

A: Oh, I didn™t need my  parent s, because to be a Jew, and learn in 
Hungary
, in that 
period of --  of 
Hh
orthy,  h-o-r-t-h-y. 
It wasn™t -- It w as not very  difficult, cause  i-it -- it 
starte d w ith the fact that my  fathe r couldn™t study, so -- so the -- and -- and in -- in the 
schoo l, different re marks, that y ou have killed our 
Jesus
, etcetera
, 
and -- and to -- final ly, 
the childre n in the s -- in the school were products of their parents, and -- and I think that 
if y ou -- if y ou are a -- if y ou are a -- a salesma n, and -- andy ou are not hones t with your 
-- withyour clients -- they say that Mr. 
Meyer
 was not honest, but if the Mr. 
Meyer 
is a 
Jew, then the Jewish -- the Jew ish sales man, Mr. 
Meyer
, etcetera. So, to be -- to be a 
Jew, it belongs to the pro fess ion o f the -- to the person, to -- to the imagi nation  of people.  
And, y ou know, I don™t knoww ho --w ho is -- who --w ho said that the anti-Semi tis m 

doesn ™t need any Jews, andy ou can™t be a ga--y ou can™t be an anti- Se mi te if --  if never, 
never iny our life, y ou never have seen one single Jew . It™s all -- I don™t know if y ou

Jews are in 
A ustria
, and people,  certain peop le said 1,000,000, and in fact, I think 7,000, 
because the Austrian Jew s have been -- have been kille d in the mea nti me. O r, doy ou 

want a nay -- a Jew ish neighbor? 30 percent said no. O r, doy ou want to shake the hand 
of a Jew?  30 percent or 31 percent said no. And they  really, they  ca-canno t kno w a lot of

Q: So thenhow, as a young man,  didy ou regard being Jewish?  I mean, y ou didn™t have a 
lot of inp ut in a religious way , itw as an in -- it was a burden in terms y our father was. 
How did y ou think abo ut it asy our identity?

have been added to -- to these outs ide re mark s, criticis ms, and -- andso I thinky ou --y ou 

can, andy ou must acce pt the fact. So, as -- if y ou see some bo dy  who, he only  has one 
leg,  so he -- finally  heaccepts the fact, it vee-- to live with one leg, is still better  than not 

to live at all. So, there is a s-simp le fact for the -- 

Q: You™ve talked a lot about y our father bein g very  generous, and honest,  and y ou™ve 
talked abo uty our mother being very  bright.Would --W hat thing s didy ourparent s teach 

you?  
A: Th
isat
 is extre mely  di fficult to say, because as I lostmy  father, I was 13, my mo ther, 
15. And --And ify outh-thi nk o f general tea ching,  I think that -- that my  fath er was more 

important 
in this do main than

 I think, even if he le ft earlier. My  
moth er, it was -- shewas differe nt, because we did all the daily light -- th-the -- the -- the 
daily  life.  The preparat ion of the next -- the next -- the next day , to-- to ask questions of 

histo ry or -- or literatu re, or w hatever,  because the next day , I had these lesson s.And she 
learned with me pian o -- piano play ing,  so she -- she sat down and spent hours at the

A nd once,  in

inven ted by 
M artin Luther
. And 
Luther 
pr opose als o to send out the Jews tow ork.A nd 
in connect ion to this, he said that he positi vel y knew that locked trains

-- the railway  station of our town.H e didn™t know where they  
were going, but he -- he knew that they  ca me fro m 
It a l y

Jewish fa milies forget about the C hrist ma s tree this y ear. I don™t kno w, I -- howwe 

reacted in this ti me, but -- but we -- but he knew  the deportation was in the neighbor hoo d.  

He didn™t n --He didn™ t say that the next victi m, o u-ou-o urselves, but he w arned us

i magi ne that 67 people during thre e day s in such a car, I think there is -- it -- itself very  
distu rbin g, but it was not that bad,  it -- later,  because w e -- in the -- we had --w ecould 

eat before, and the starving period  ex -- started later, andthe deaths - - the deaths in this

Q: Doy oure me mber wheny ou -- how  didyou realize that people were being killed with 
gas at 
Auschw itz
?   W hen and how? 
A: It™s not the gas, butthe -- the -- the fire. Because the fire came out , and very  ofteny ou 

heard a horrible --y ou s mel led so mething horrible, which was between burned me at and 
fa t,  and sowhich w as in fact, a huma n body . And this --it came out, this fine, black rain.  

So it -- itwas n-no dou bt that people have been killed. 
Q: Did people talk abo ut it?  The pr -- other prisoner s?  

A: Yes, of course.  In there w e had nothin g else to --y es,  we had, because the -- the food 

was very poor, a kind of arti ficial ja m,  and margarin e, and we always --w e hada drea m,

Auschw itz
? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay, where didy ou meet up with the m, were they  on the same train withy ou?

 I think y es. I think y es, but it di -- di -- didn™t bother us, and no-not

Q: Okay. Soy ou me t up w ith y our frie nds, werey ou able to sleep in the sa me space?  

A: I don™t re me mber if we slept in the same place. Maybey es,  or fro m time to time. 
Sleep ing on the same place, itwas very  adventurous because w e had nothing, no -- no 
beds, and absolu tely  nothing. W ehad only 
a- how doy ou call the ﬁp lancheﬂ?

Q: Mat?  A plank?  
A: Yes, a plank. Not a plank,  but plank s. And on the planks, we couldn™t -- we couldn™t 
lay down,  because y -- so ma ny  people, and no place. So it™s called this sittin g -- 
m arine 
sittin g.  You know what it is?  It -- It -- I was sitting so, sothe -- the two legs -- in between

about the g uards that g uarded y ou, and also about inter actions withGer mans. 
A: So, y ou were asking -- I -- I don™t know,10 question s.  It is -- It is not so easy. I think 
that the -- the social order of 
Ausc hwitz
 of th e ti me -- of this ti me, was that of course the 
SS
 co mma nded,  executed by a lot of horribl e Polish pe ople, absol utely horrib le,  and I

so mewhere , between tw o barracks, and behind me, a Gy psy with a baton.A nd instead of 
avoid ing me, he struck  me on -- on my  -- onmy  back, because he wa-want -- he w anted 
me to go out of his way. Thiswas the Gy psy , later he died, very probably . Then ca me the 
Poli sh 
kapos
, an absolutely horrib le,  horrible part of hu manity.  They  had the right,  for 
insta nce, to -- apparently, because they  did it, to exchange people selected for the -- for 
the gas, because they knew some body, or -- in the mea nt i me, I profited so mew here of
f
 
this attitude. And -- And then the -- the 
SS
, it was -- the contact with the 
SS
 wasnot 
direct. The contac t was every day , the so-call e d 
appe ll e
, y ou know re  --what it is -- 
what itwas. A nd -- A nd so, if -- if one person  was missing, they hadto start agai n, to 

count agai n, but it took hours, and y ou can i magine then, it happene d to me,  that th-the 

fo od w as so horrible t hat I beca me a very gr-great diarrh ea, and I couldn™t go out, 
because w e had to stay  there, andI -- I -- I had no solution, so itwent.A nd very bad sign, 
fl ies w ere co min g -- isw a -- by the way, flies  were the only  ani mals  we saw, plus the 
SS
 
dogs, but there was no butter fly, nothing, no birds, just flies.  And -- And so i-i-i-it w as a 
extre me -- extre mely bad, the 
appelle
, and the -- but this has been ordered by the 
SS
. I -- 
What I don™t understa nd, the logic of the whole thing, because i f some bo dy  was mi ssin g,  
it was not sure, and there never was one -- plus one, only mi nus one, and -- and they had 
to find out w here it --where he was.  So it -- it took ti me. The Jew ish co mman ders, or the 

s o us - c o mm a nd e r s
[ind ecipherable]
 w ere also quite bad because --because they -- they -- 
they  regularly  stole the 
midare
 
--the -- the fo od. You know, I had acoupl e of ti mes,

, which was 
Rosh Hashan ah

they  -- they  apparently knew the Jew ish calendar. And then I -- I think that nobody spoke 
of the s mili ng side of 
Mengele
. 
Mengele
 could s mile,and he selected the deaths s mil ing, 
with  rapture, a little bit. And if some bo dy didn™t obey ,  then he became very  angry. But 
he -- But otherwise,  he w as s mil in g, and -- tomake this j ob. You know, there is

M engeles -- 
Mengele

Q: So by now y ou™velost both ofy our friend s? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. And cany ou descri be what the mar ch was like?

it™s not about how  themarch was

I never seen such amarch, othe r -- so -- like, this is -- this is not

A: Here not. Iw ent to the

Museu m i n 
Los A ngeles
, but I toldy ou. And I 
think that t his is the co mme nt,  and the expos ition of this  whole thing, too smoo th, too 
delicate for  this -- for this horror,  which has been represented by the shoes. So therefo re, I 
think that what 
you we 
are doing -- what you are doing, I am d oing now , is finally, this is 
hopel ess, and th-th -- it is not -- because I cannot tell y ou -- y ou -- y ou ask w hat w as it 
like. The question is -- has beenmade in su ch a way that I underst and thaty ou will --y ou 
cannot i ma gine what it w as.  In -- In no -- I -- I -- I know-- I know no hu man be ing 

capable of i magining such a horro r. So this is -- this is not a -- this is not a normal level, 

y ou know .So this experience is not trans fera ble. I mad e this experie nce, and now I -- it 
belon gs to me, and --and I -- it is one of my  -- my  greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of 

life.  But I cannot tran sfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the fil m of shi -- of 
Sc hindler
, cannot 
be a -- a realistic fil m, becaus e y ou cannot fi nd 
200 two 
hundred actors, and to-- to lock 
the m, and let the m lo se the weight. So this --y ou can™t --y ou cannot  do it. So ify ou 
can™t, the picture sy ouwill see will be wrong, and will not correspo nd to the -- to the 

reality . So this is not fe asible. O nly  if some body organized a ki -- a ca mp, and you went 
into the camp, but I d -- I don™t wish y ou to go there, so these a -- it™s an initial 

contradiction in the thing, and --and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to 
live w ith every  day, but to think of it, to do --to know that this is not a nor mal museu m, 

this is a museu m o f the death, and -- and this -- the w hole story  is the story  of the death, 
and the death is -- thedeath -- death is horribl e,  it™s horri ble to die with 15 or fi -- 16. It™s

I magi ne 200 people in a -- in 
America
, waiting on the electric chair together.What w ill 
they  say? W ho w ould cry, w ho would shout?  So, but this is -- this is -- it cannot happen.

Well, I think I could go

A: H m?  

Q: At the end of the march, how -- what kind of state werey ou in phy sically?

peak, I guess. 

A: Yes.

we™re -- where wew ere last time were, to the British terr itory . It made no sense . So what 
is the adva ntage to be liberat ed by the Britis h instead o f theA mer icans?  So -- Or -- I -- 
Q: Can y ou describe th e mo ment of liberation ?

in  very  bad 
health, and a couple of day s are missing, soy ou know  that I re me mb er of the days, a 

coupl e of d ay s are mis sing, because very  probably  Iw as in a kind of co ma, and instead of

a had  a
 big chance, because on perhaps the 10
th
 
or the 11
th
 of May, I asked a -- age -- a G erma n sold ier , w ho became prisone r in the 
meanti me, ﬁHow about the war? ﬂ And he said, ﬁThe war?  The war is fin ishe d. ﬂ A nd then 
I understo od that I felt out for a -- a good cou ple of day s. 
Q: S-So y ou don™t re me mber the Briti sh soldiers co mi ng in, and -- 
A: Yes, the British soldiers co mi ng in, y es, but it happened later. The British so ldiers

Q: What was that like w hen the -- can y ou just describe w hat itwas like w hen the British 

soldi ers came in to
