Question: Good mo rning. 
Answer: Good morning, 
Joan
. 
Q: It™s really lovely to see you. 
A: Thank you. Love
ly to see you. 
Q: Thank you. What was your name
 Œ what is your name now? 
A: My name is
 Ninetta Feldman
. 
Q: And what was your name at birth? 
A: My name at birth was 
Ninetta
. I was actually named after my  grandmother, which 
was the tradition in 
Greece
, to have the daughter of Œ the first daughter to be named after 
the mother of the father. So
 my  grandmother™s name was 
Sarah
, so I became 
Sarah
, 
Serena
, 
Nina
, 
Ninetta
. So I ended up with 
Ninetta
. I had many first cousins with name 
was 
Nina
, th ey also were named after my  grandmother 
Sara h
, but they used the 
Nina
. I-
It Œ 

Q: Was her name 
Nina
 also? 
A: No, her Œ my  gran dmother™s name was 
Sarah
, 
Sa rah
, but the Œ the granddaughters 
were named either 
Nina
 or Œ 
Nina
, for the most part. I was an exception. 
Q: You were 
Ninetta
. 
A: 
Ninetta
.

Q: And your last name? 
A: My n Œ my  last name, maiden name is 
Matza
. 
Q: Now, th Œ when
 it™s a male, it™s 
Matsas
, is that correct? 
A: 
Matsas
, right. And if it™s a female is 
Matza
, which really means you are the daughter 
of 
Ma tsa s
. In Œ in 
Greece
, you™re either the daughter 
of someone, or the wife of 
someone. So  it™s the Œ you Œ you 
decline the Œ the Œ th e name, 
Matsas
, of 
Matza
 Œ of 
Matsas
, wh ich beco mes 
Matsas
, the generative Œ you decline the name. And so my  
n ame, maid en  n ame is 
Matza
, not 
Matsas
.  
Q: Right. Now, wh-wh-when one is 
named after the Œ your grandmother Œ 
A: I™m sorry? 
Q: 
Sarah
 Œ when  you were named 
after your grandmother Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ was she still alive? 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: So this is different than in the 
Ashkenazi
 tradition isn™t it? 
A: Yes. 
Q: That you can be named in the Sephar
dic tradition with someone who™s alive. 
A: That™s right. I think the Greek Jews adop
ted this tradition from the Christians because 
the Christian Greeks also name their childre
n after the grandparen
ts, regardless whether 
they™re living or not, and so  the first son is 
named after the father of the father, after the

grandfather. The father of the father. The seco
nd son will be named after the father of the 
mother.  
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: The Œ if there™s a daughter, the first da
ughter will be named after the mother of the 
father, and the second daughte
r after the mother of the Œ 
the f Œ the mother, after the 
mother of the mother. So it creates a lot of
 confusion, because there are so many people 
with the same first name and surname. 

Q: Right, right. And what
 Œ wh en were you born? 
A: I was born March 21
st
, 1938. 
Q: Right, so you were a ve
ry young child 
at the time. 
A: Very young, yes. 

Q: Now was Œ y-you have a brother, 
Michael
. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Was he named after Œ 
A: After my grandfather 
Na ho um
. 
Q: Right. 
A: Now, to have a name like 
Nahoum
 in 
Greece
 does not make a child very comfortable, 
because it™s very unusual. So he was Œ he 
grew up known by that Œ his nickname, 
Mykas
(ph), his friends called him 
Mykas
(ph), but his official name is 
Na ho um
. A n d  

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

then when he
 came to the 
United States
, he changed his name further, from 
Œ Mykas
(ph) 
became 
Michael
. 
Q: Right. 
A: But his birth name is 
Na ho um
, after my  grandfather. 
Q: And his Œ and his middle name now, is 
Nahoum
. 
A: Right, right, he retained the na
me, but became his middle name, yes. 
Q: Now, since you were so young at the tim
e, do you think you ca
n distinguish between 
what your earliest memories are,
 and what you were told happ
ened, or is that difficult? 
A: That™s a very, very  good question, I often 
sort of struggle with  it, trying to determine 
whether my recollection is a firsthand experien
ce, or it™s a reconstruc
tion of what I heard 
from Œ so many times from my  parents and my  
brother. There are certain scenes that I 
know for sure; I™m talking a
bout the earliest recollections
, when I was perhaps three 
years old. There™s certain scenes that I Œ I 
know, I rememb er very vividly. And I know 
these are firsthand recollections. 
Q: So perhaps when  we speak, you can make
 a distinction between what you know, or 
your f Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ your own memories, and wh
at you™re not sure about Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and wh at you were told.

A: Yes. 
Q: Maybe we can do tho Œ all Œ all of those three things. 

A: Yes, yes, I can do that. 
Q: So what Œ what is Œ what
 are your earliest memories? 
A: My earliest memory is when I was th
ree years old, and I was a Œ in 1941 Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ there was a time when my 
father was drafted to the army , and we decided, the whole 
family decided to move to 
Ioannina
. He was supposed to report in 
Ioannina
. That™s 
where his company was going to assemble, 
and march north toward s the Greek-A lban ian 

border. And we decided it would be better for all of us to move to 
Ioannina
, since we 
had so many relatives there. And so we Œ we
 lived at my aunt™s house, my mother™s 
sister™s house. And there we were surrounded
 by Œ by so many close relatives, all our 
entire family was there; grandparents, aunts, 
uncles, cousins. And I have this image of a 
very long table in my  grandmother™s house, 
where all the grandchildren were assemb led, 
and my  grandmother serving 
rizo galo
. 
Rizo galo
 is rice pudding, and I had to have this 
very vivid scene in my  mind of my grandmot
her and all the children 
gathered around the 
table. That™s my earliest recollection. 
Q: Do you reme mb er moving to 
Io annina
, or Œ or you don™t remember that? 
A: The actual move, the transportation? 
Q: Right, yes.

A: Not really, don™t have recollection of that. 
Q: Right. 

A: I just know I found myself in Œ  
Q: In
 Ioannina
. 
A: In 
Ioannina
, right. 
Q: With the family. 
A: Right. 
Q: Have you, with your brothe
r or with your mother
 and father after the war, do you re Œ 
do you rememb er saying th is about that scene 
and saying Œ do you reme
mber that, or not? 
A: Do I remember saying, or
 describing th is to them? 
Q: Yes, to Œ to them, an-and Œ 
A: I Œ I probably did, because it is a very fo
nd memory. It was Œ it was probably the last 
time that I remember seeing my grandmother. 

Q: I see. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Was she Œ was she deported? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Oh, she was? 
A: Yes. 

Q: From 
Ioannina
. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
9
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The other vivid Œ vivid scene that I have
 is rushing to the sh
elter from my aunt™s 
house. There was a f Œ an old fortress in 
Ioannina
, which perh aps, I don™t know exactly 
when it was built, perhaps Middle Ages, but then it was reinforced
 during the Turkish 
occupation, and it was a very thick wall, a
nd it was used for shelter, and it was a very 
short distance from my  aunt™s house to the sh
elter. So I remember b eing in this dark 
place, and I remember that it was something 
dangerous that was going on, but we were 
safe in this dark place. Th-T
h-This was the time when Italian airplanes would fly over 
that 
Epirus
. This is the province in 
Greece 
where 
Ioannina 
is the capital. 
Q: Right. 

A: And there was a fear of bombing of the city
 and so  we would go into the shelter. So I 
remember that scene of this dark place, a
nd a lot of people crowded down there for 
safety. Tha-That™s a first Œ I can say very cl
early, this was a first re-recollection, first 
hand recollection. 
Q: And do you remember 
being held by your mo ther, or yo
ur father? I mean, do you have 
a rec Œ 
A: Yes. I Œ I Œ not Œ not my father, because
 my  father was already drafted, but my  
mo ther, for Œ for me, my  mo ther was my  Œ my  
security blanket. I thought that as long as 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

she was with me, nothing bad was Œ would ha
ppen. A-And I always, I Œ throughout the 
war period, I had that feeling, that as long as she is with me Œ 
Q: That it™s okay. 
A: Œ I™m gonna be safe. 
Q: Now, did you a Œ do you remember feelin
g frighten ed , or being told that th Œ it was 
dangerous? I mean, do you re
member what she told you? 
A: During th is particular period, or later on? 
Q: No, this Œ in this
 Œ in this period. 
A: This is Œ yes Œ 
Q: Cause this is when the Italians take over. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So the Germans are not there yet. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 
A: Not really. I just remember th at it was day 
Œ it was dangerous to be outside this Œ this 
fortress. Once you were there, you were safe, 
and Œ and it was Œ I didn™t have a sense of 
fear, real fear, it was Œ I don™t remember what
 the Œ my feelings. I knew that as long as 

mother was near me, I was okay. 
Q: You were okay. 

A: Yes. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
11
Q: Right. 
A: It was Œ it was 
[indecipherable]
 there, when my  brother, of course was probably 11 
years at the time, he was Œ 
Q: Do you reme mb er your brother at the time? 
A: Was another early recollection that I have. Th
is is Œ this is in 1941 - ™42, when there 
were tremendous food shortages in Œ in 
Greece
, and I remember, y ou know, my Œ my 
parents had to go to the nearby villages surrounding 
Agrinion
, such as 
Moustafree
(ph) 
was one of the Œ one of the villages, and 
Verkini
(ph) was another one, wh ere they would 
go to  buy food supplies. So my  mo ther would 
absent herself for long periods of time, and 
my  brother, who was 11 - 12 years old, was ve
ry concerned that wh en Œ that when I woke 
up in  the mo rning and I opened my  eyes and I r
ealized Mother wasn™t there, I would start 

to cry. So  I reme mb er him with his spoonful of
 fruit preserves, is like st Œ not strawberry, 

preserves like some other kinds of fruit, wait
ing fo r me to open my  eyes and put this 
teaspoon full of Œ of jam, so that I wouldn™t 
cry. I reme mber that very  vividly. And we 
have a thing, I remember where my br
other was making dolls for me, massive 
production. They were very 
simple little dolls with sticks
 and you know, painted faces, 
but he would do that to amuse 
me, and I remember that, too. 
Q: That™s very sweet. 

A: Yeah, he was very sweet, very
 attentive, and very lo ving.  
Q: Well, you Œ I™m Œ I™m suspecting th at 
you were told how l
ong you stayed in 
Ioannina
. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
12
A: Yes, we Œ we stayed in 
Ioannina
 from the time my father was drafted, which was Œ he 
Œ he was supposed to  repor
t to his company April 1
st
, 1940 Œ 1941, until the Italians 
surrendered, which was the end of April, and 
we Œ my  father was actually among th e last 
soldiers to return fro m the front. He never saw battle, because as soon as he reached the 
front, negotiations started, 
Germany
 came to the aid of 
Italy
, and negotiations started for 
a peace treaty. So he never saw battle, but he 
was Œ he was untrained. He was Œ he Œ this 
was the second time he was drafted. The firs
t time was when he was 21 years old. No w, 
he was 35 - 37 years old, he was overweight. 
He was not trained the 
first time, he had an 
office job. And certainly not trained the second 
time. So he didn™t re
ally know how to use 
a rifle Œ basic, he never had ba
sic training. And so he was fore
ver not Œ he was not able to 
keep up with the others Œ Gr
eek soldiers. He was separated from his company several 
times. He had to deal with a 
mule that was not very cooper
ative. So, going to the front 
and return ing, he was Œ was a struggle for 
him. So he was among the last soldiers to 
return, and so my Œ I Œ I hear
d my  mo ther and brother sayi
ng how they would go out to 
the main street every morning, every day, waiti
ng for my father to show up. It was a very 
anxious time for them. So, afte
r he returned, we Œ we, the 
whole family returned to 
Agrinion
. This is Œ this is the 
time when German and Italia
n troops began pouring into  
the Œ the country . A-And Germans 
actually first came to Œ to 
Ioannina
, but then later on, 
as we will discuss, later on the Œ the Œ the 
Œ the occupation zones 
were determined and 
the Germans occupied  the north ern part of 
Greece
, and the Bu lgarians another section. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

13
Q: Yes, the ri Œ 
A: Small section Œ 

Q: Small section of the north , yes. 
A: Œ in the north, while the rest
 of the country was i Œ occupi
ed by the Italians, with the 
exception of half Œ half of 
Crete 
and so me major islands in the 
Aegean
. So Œ so  we Œ we 
returned to Œ to 
Ag rinio n
 after my father was discharged. 
Q: But you were born not in 
Ag rinio n
, right? You were bo Œ 
A: I was Œ 
Q: Œ you were born in  
Arta
. 
A: 
Arta
. 
Arta
 is a small city near 
Ioannina
, because my father was transferred to Œ he 
had several transfers. First he was transferre d to 
Arta
 and th en Œ then to 
Preveza
, and 
from 
Preveza
 to 
Agrinion
. So when we came to 
Agrinion
, I was two years old, but I Œ I 
was born in 
Arta
. And I often think of how chance even
ts determin ed, at that time at 
least, your Œ wh ether you were going to  live 
or die, because had my  father not been 
transferred to 
Ag rinion
, if he had stayed in 
Ioannina
, or 
Arta
, or 
Preveza
, the chances 
of our surviv al would have been very ni Œ mu ch  diminished . 

Q: Right. 
A: So this Œ this ch
ance events determine Œ 
Q: What happened. 
A: Œ wh at happened.

Q: Now, he was working in
 bank, is that correct? 
A: Yes, he was work ing for the National Bank of 
Greece
, yes. He started his career in Œ 
in Œ in 
Ioannina
. His father was i n  the milk and wine business. 
Q: Milk and wine? 
A: Yes, yes, dairy products. He made yogu
rt and ch eese, and wine. And several of his 
sons wo rked  in the business. 
And my father actually, when 
he became Œ finished high 
school, he thought of going into  the same  busin
ess, but on a mo re sophisticated level, so 
he decided to go to 
Athens
 and study in th e school of agriculture in 
Athens
, of the 
production of dairy products. 
But unfortunately the Œ the wa
r caused the Œ the university 
to close, and he abandoned those studies, 
and he passed the entr
ance exam for the 
National Bank of 
Greece
, which was a Œ a rather prestigious job fo-for 
Greece
. So he Œ 
this is Œ he started his career
 as a bank employee in Œ in 
Ioannina
. 
Q: When  did your parent
s marry? Do you know? 
A: Ah, they married Œ I should
 know that, right? See Œ my 
Œ 19 Œ 1927, I believe. Yeah, I 
believe it was, yes. My mo ther was 21 years old, my  father 26, so Œ 

Q: Right. 

A: Œ it was ™27, ™28, perhaps. 
Q: Right. 
A: Maybe ™29, I™m not sure.

Q: But eight or nine years before you were
 born. Something like th at. And then your 
brother obviously was born first. 
A: Yes, yes, right, right. 
Q: And your mo ther didn™t wo rk
, she was i-i-in the house. 
A: No, my Œ 
Q: I shouldn™t say she didn™t work, I mean sh e managed 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Sh Œ my mo ther, no, she did not have a 
job, she Œ she was a 
housewife, like most 
Greek women of that middle class were. But 
she was a very Œ very
 dynamic person, and 
she took great pride in th
e fact that, growing up in  
Albania 
Œ because my mother was 
born in 
Albania
 Œ her parents moved to 
Albania
 from
 Ioannina
, because there were 
better economic opportunities there. And she took
 great pride in the fact that sh e was Œ 
she worked in my father™s fa
bric store, and she 
loved dealing with  Œ with Œ with the 
customers, and they liked 
her. The customers liked her. 
And my  grandfather would 
always say, oh 
Esther
 Œ that™s my mother™s name Œ 
Esther
 is my right hand. So she was 
a business minded woman, but she never, during 
that period, didn™t have the opportunity 
to Œ or it was Œ it was unusual for women to Œ 
to go into business at
 that time. As my Œ 
my  father was born in 
Ioannina
, and he attended the Œ 
a school that™s called 
Alliance 
Israélite U n iverselle
. These were schools that were established by th e 
Rothschild 
family, th-the Œ the branch of 
France
, to raise the educational level of the Jews of that 
area. So there were several of these schools es
tablished, and they  were really excellent 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

16
schools, where the children were taught He
brew, French and Gree
k. And wh en you Œ 
when you were graduated from this school, I 
think it ended up to  the Œ went up to the 
sixth or seventh grad e, you really had mast
ered French, because all the subjects were 
taught in French, including history. Then, 
of course, Hebrew; the biblical Hebrew, and 
some modern, conversational Hebrew, and of c
ourse, Greek. And then my  father went to 
the Greek high school, and he was flue
nt in Œ in  Greek, of course. And 
[indecipherable]
 
my mother, she grew up in 
Albania
 where the, I think at the 
time, the illiteracy level was 
very, very  high. Bu t her Œ her brother was well 
educated. He had gone to a private school 
since he studied in 
Italy
 as well. And education was very 
important, so they send th em to 
a private school in 
Albania
, in 
Delvina
. But unfortunately there 
were some anti-Semitic 
co mmen t s mad e  th at mad e  my
 mother and her sister 
Eftyhia
 very  uncomfortable. And so 
their parents send them to 
Corfu
. In 
Co rfu
 there was a school run by French  nuns, and it 
was an excellent Œ it was a board ing school, only th e rich girls could go there, it was a 

girls™ school. And th ere she studied French . Sh e was a very smart woman, and she 
entered the school know Œ not knowing a word
 of Fren ch, and within two years she b Œ 
she became fluent. So that was her 
education, took place in Œ in 
Co rfu
. So Œ 
Q: When you were a small 
child, when  you moved to  
Ag rinion
, you™re three years old 
then? 
A: At
 Ag rinio n  
was, when  we first moved I was two years old, yes. 
Q: Two.

A: Two. 
Q: So that was 1940. 

A: Yes, yes.  
Q: Does your Œ does your mo th er and father sc
hool you at all? I mean, clearly schools are 
going to  be cl Œ I assume schools are closed, or
 you™re too young to 
go to  school at that 
point. 
A: In 
Ag rinio n
? 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah, I was too young to go
 to school. No , I Œ my  Œ my  f Œ my  brother was in high 
school at the time, but I was Œ 
Q: So he Œ he was going to  school? 
A: Yes, he was going to  school. 

Q: So when the Italians o
ccupied, the schools kept going; they didn™t close down the 
schools? 
A: They had to close my  brother™s high sch
ool, because it was used as a hospital, along 
with a tobacco warehouse 
[indecipherable]
 tobacco warehouse.
 Agrinion
 is a Œ a great 
producer of tobacco, so  there were a lot of
 tobacco warehouses in the city. So my 
brother™s high school closed because it was co
nverted into a hospital and there were Œ 
and 
Agrinion
 is in the main 
artery  connecting 
Athens
 with 
Ioannina
 and the front, the 
Greek-Albanian front, so there were Œ so the soldiers, the wounde
d soldiers from the

conflict with the Œ the Italians we
r e brought Œ were passe d through 
Agrinion
, and so th ey 
Œ they had to close the high school be
cause it was converted 
into a hospital.  
Q: Your father was working in the bank Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in 
Agrinion
. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And he didn™t work that way through th
e entire war, I gather, because at a certain 
point, wh en the Germans take over Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ from the Italians Œ 
A: Right. This is the Œ the 
time my Œ my father worked at
 the bank until September Œ oh 
no, I™m sorry, October Œ October, 1943. This is
 the time when we had 
to leave the city.  
Q: Do you remember that
, that you had to leave? 
A: Yes, yes, I Œ by then I was already five 
years old, and I do rememb er quite vividly our 

departure from Œ 
Q: What was that like? 

A: Well, what happened, 
this is the time when 
Italy
 withdrew from the Œ surrendered, 
withdrew from the war, and the Œ the Germans 
moved into  the areas that were contro lled 
by the Italians, so Œ so I remember Œ I rememb
er seeing German soldiers in the streets. I

the Œ the Œ th eir cap was pushed down, and I re
memb er that very vividly. Rememb er sole 
Œ German soldiers in the street

Yo na s
 
Mionis
, who was a 
resident of 
Agrinion
, and was a Œ he was a teacher, a
nd he was a memb er of the Greek 
resistance, a leading member of the Greek re
s-resistance, he came to  and met my father 
and told  him that Œ that the Jews of 
Athens
 had gone into hiding, and th at the Jewish 
families of 
Agrinion
 have de-decided to leave the city. 
And so this Œ this is when I Œ I 
remember Œ I rememb er when my father, we

Beginning Tape Two  
Q: We™ve come to a scene that you remember qu
ite vividly, as a Œ as a memo ry of your Œ 
of your own, with your
 f Œ your father in 
Agrinion
, and when a Mr. 
Mionis
 Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ comes Œ ha-has already spoken to your fa Œ 

A: Has already spoken to my father, yes, a
nd it™s actually Friday  night, and my  f Œ we Œ 
we were Œ my mother Œ re
member, my mother, my brot
her and I are sitting on the 
balcony, waiting for my father to come 
home from work. And w-we saw him and we Œ 
and I remember my mother commenting that 
he looked very  down cast, you know, his 
head was sort of down and his shoulders be
nt over, and she said, something is wrong, 
something™s wrong. And so  my  father comes in
, and he takes us all inside, and he said, I 
just spoke with 
Yo na s
 
Mionis
 and he told  us that the Jews of 
Athens
 have gone into 
hiding and that all th
e Jewish families in 
Agrinion
, they ™re considering Œ no-not 
everybody had decided yet, 
but they™re considering leav
ing the city. A-And so I 
remember that. 

Q: And you remember 
that conversation. 
A: That Œ that Œ 
Q: Sort of.

21
A: Œ the v Œ not in such great detail, but
 that Œ that Œ that th-the Jews of 
Athens
 have 
gone into hiding, I remember that. Now, the re
st of it is very hard to tell, whether it™s 
firsthand experience or not. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Well, of course, you know, later on, as
 adults, we found out why the Jews of 
Athens 
had gone into hiding. Th
e reason was, you know, wh en the Germans occupied  
Athens
, 
they asked the chief rabbi of 
Athens
,
 Barzilai
, to supply them with names and addresses 
of all the families Œ of the Jewish families of 
Athens
, and they gave hi
m three days to do 
that. And it™s not very clear exactly what ha
ppened, but the Greek 
resistance tha t had 
gone Œ grown pretty strong by 
then in Œ in the cities, and th
ey decided to 
Œ to help the 
rabbi leave the city, sort 
of almo st abduction, and 
Baru ch Shid is
(ph), we learned later on 
was a Jewish journalist, he was instrumental
 in arranging for this, the removal of the 

rabbi from the city, so to prev
en t him from providing the lists, and also give a message to 
the Jews of 
Athens
 that they™re in danger. Because as
 soon as he Œ the wo rd got around 
that he was Œ he ha Œ had left the city with
 his wife and daughter, they took him to the 
mainland, to the mountains in central 
Greece
. Then the Jews of 
Athens
 either left the 
city, went into the mountains, or hid in th e Œ 
within the city. 
So the word  go
t around that 
the Jews of 
Athens
 had gone into hiding, and that was the message that 
Yonas
 brought 
from a merchant that ha
d just returned from 
Athens
; he had the in formation.

Q: Do you reme mb er feeling 
the fear in your parents? 
Do  Œ do Œ would you rememb er 
that part of it, or Œ 
A: My mother was a very emotional person, 
very excitable, unlike my father, who was a 
very calm person, and he Œ h-
he Œ so my  mo ther was Œ were very emotional an-and I 
could sense that it was something wrong, so
mething bad was about to happen. But Œ but 
my father always tried to as Œ reassure us 
that everything was Œ he™s a ver Œ perp etual 
optimist. Everything is going 
to work out fine. And they Œ 
they  had a very nice Œ very 
different personalities, but they
 complimented each other, and 
in our situation during the 
war, it turned out that their 
traits andpersonality were 
very, very useful to have. 
Q: As a ch Œ for a child, yes. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So, was the decision then made to 
move to the small village outside of 
Ag rinio n
? 
A: The Œ the decision was made that we have 
to move, we have to leave the city. Where 
we were going to go, there was a questio
n mark. My parents immediately started 
distributing our possessions to neig hbors. An
d we had amassed a lot of food from the 
villages during this peri
od. People in Œ in 
Athens
 were starving to death, but we had 
plenty of food, because we ha
d brought a lot of fo
od from these surroun
ding villages, and 
they were stored in the house.
 So, we get some of the food
 to neig hbors, and Œ and also 
the bank, the National Bank of 
Greece
, they had a special room where they had stored 
food for the employees. And they
 stored our Œ some of our fo
od supplies also t h ere. We Œ

we moved our fu rniture into one room. We Œ 
we occupied  the upper floor of a two story 
house, and we moved the furniture in one ro
om, and we distributed 
our other clothing and 
other household items t o  neighbors. But we r
eally didn™t know where we were going to 
go. That had not been  decided yet. All we 
knew was that we have to leave the city. 
Q: Right. No w, do you reme mb er all of 
this movement in th
e Œ in th e house? 
A: Not firsthand. 

Q: Yeah, right. 
A: No, I don™t rememb er that. But I should sa
y something that I rememb er very vividly, 
that really goes back  in my  story, maybe. 
Q: Oh, that™s funny, yes. 
A: This is before the Œ the Italian surrender. 
There was a Œ an Italian officer, or soldier, I 
don™t know his rank, who lived  downstairs, the 
lower part of our house, and he liked me. 
And I have a picture of him with me, and he
, one day sort of disa
ppeared. We didn™t 
know wh ere he went, and when  he came  back, 
he brought me a beautiful doll. It was the 
mo st beautiful doll I ever owned in my  life. 
I don™t know where it is 
now, if it Œ I Œ I Œ it 
was misplaced, I lost it. But it 
was the mo st beautiful doll. And it was sort of a Œ I never 
questioned at that time, you 
know, why he brought me the doll, because I didn™t know 
that he was the enemy, he was the occupying
 force Œ represented the occupying force. 
But it was a very Œ have a very nice, 
fond memo ry of that Œ of that man. 
Q: But he was living on th e 
fir Œ in the first floor. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
24
A: Y-Yes, yes. 
Q: But you weren™t afraid
 of him, were you? 
A: No, no. The ital Œ we were no
t afraid of the Italians. The 
Italians were not Œ they did 
not list Œ create any fear in us. Although, in 
1942, the Italian author
ities requested that all 
the Jewish families register 
with them. But we never though
t that anything bad was going 
to happen . And so Œ and so  my  father later on,
 he tried to explain to me why this Italian 
officer, soldier, brought me a doll, and he 
said maybe you remind him of his daughter, 
maybe he wants to show th at underneath hi
s unifo rm, he is really a human being. And 

you know, my  parents, they both
 sp oke Italian. At some point in their lives, they learned 
Italian in their youth. 
Albania
 was occupied by 
Italy 
for a
 
period of time, and then Œ my  
father was always interested in languages, th
e si Œ he managed to 
learn Italian and Œ and 
they knew Italian songs, which 
they used to  sing. And I always grew  up with a love for 
Italians, Italian culture. I Œ I-I never felt afraid
 of Italians. And Œ and the house that we 
moved in  after the war had a beautiful garden, and it was a garden that was made by the 
Italian soldiers. Wherever th
ey had Œ they  went, they tried to Œ to  create something 
beautiful. 
Q: So for you, as a child, was Œ there™s a 
real difference when th
e Germans Œ when you 
see a German soldier. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And you Œ you mu st have
 felt something different Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
25
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Œ wh en Œ wh en th ey occupied . 

A: Yes, the Œ the German soldiers are Œ are Œ 
cause I ha Œ I saw them in the streets. They 
were Œ they were real Œ they elicited a sense 
of fear and just Œ and we were advised by 
our mo th er to avoid looking at them, or in
teracting with th em, and Œ but there was a 
difference, yes. 

Q: So, but Œ but you 
were also told Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ to be different with them. 

A: Yes. 
Q: So it must have all Œ so Œ elicited this
 is Œ mu st be me nacing in  some Œ and you 
weren™t told that about the Italians. 
A: Right. Yes, we were not Œ 

Q: So it™s hard to know what 
the Œ what you™re sensing, a
nd what you™re being told to 
sense. 

A: Yes, right, that™s true. 

Q: Yes, it™s hard. 
A: Yes. So we Œ we di
dn™t know where to go Œ coming back
 to th e story. And at that time 
there were two resistance movement in 
Greece
. One was based in the countryside in 
Epirus
, near 
Ioannina
, the outskirts of 
Ioannina
. 
EDES
 was headed by 
Na poleo n  

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
26
Ze rvas
, and they were known as the Œ but, at
 that time, the country was polarized 
between the Œ the nationalists, the right wing people, and th e leftists. And so th e 
resistance movements were 
also polarized. You have 
EDES
, head ed by 
Napoleon 
Ze rvas
 in 
Epirus
, and then 
EAM-ELAS
, much larger, very we
ll organized resistance 
movement in the countryside of 
Greece
, but also within the cities of Œ of 
Greece
. And so  
we had neighbors, friends, wh
o advised us to go to 
EDES
, and other friends who advised 
us to go to a te
rritory controlled by
 EAM-ELAS
. So we had some very close family 
friends, the 
Bokoro s 
family; there were three brothers 
and two sisters, actually three 
sister s. There was 
Christos
 and 
Thermas
(p h)
 Bokoro s
, and we knew them, we became 
fam Œ we became family friends because their sister 
Elestair
(ph) was married to a man 
who was a colleague of my father™s in Œ in  the bank. I think we met Œ they met them 

either in 
Preveza
 or 
Arta
, I don™t know. And unfor
tunately her husband, 
Elestair™s
 
husband died, and th e whole fami ly moved to 
Ag rinion
 and they  lived Œ and so she and 
her children lived with her brothers, 
Christos
 and 
Thermas
(ph) and 
Kostas Bokoro s
. 
So, we decided to ask them fo
r help, and they were wonderfu
l people, they did everything 
they could to  assure us that we™ll find you 
a place, we™ll get you out of the city. And so 
after we distributed our belongings to the ne
ighbors, my  mo ther, my  brother and I, we Œ 
we sent some of the material, clothing and fo
od and household utensils, with a porter to 
transport these things to the 
Bo koro s
™ house, and then  we, the th
ree of us, my mother, my 
brother and I followed behind. My father went to
 work  that day, he had to Œ th ey received 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
27
a very large amount of money, an d he was re
placing the Œ the cashier, so he had to go 
there and to count the money. And so we reached the 
Bo ko ro  Œ  Boko ro s
™ house, and a 
few minutes later Œ I remember this very vividl
y, I know this is a firsthand recollection. I 
reme mb er a German bursting into the house 
and Œ and then my  mother, you know, she 
saw this Œ she saw him, and she quickly push
ed him in Œ pushed me into the adjacent 
room and she quickly pulled th e covers off the bed, and pretended to calmly make the 
bed, as though she belonged  
there. She™s a very quick thinker, sh Œ amazing person. So  
th-the Œ the German sort of looked around. 
I don™t Œ we don™t know
 what Œ who he was 
looking for, and then he left. But it was a ve
ry frightening experience for Œ for Œ for all Œ 
for my  mo ther and Œ and my  brother. I don™
t remember where my brother was at this 
p o in t. All I reme mb er was my  mo th er mak i
ng the bed at this point. And she asked 
Christos
, one of the 
Bo ko ro s 
brothers to quickly go to th e 
bank and tell my father to Œ to 
drop everything and come to the house,
 we had to leave immediately. So 
Christo s
 goes 
to the bank, and told  my  father that Œ does 
he have Œ even  though
 you haven™t finished 
counting the money, you have to  drop everythi
ng and leave. An-And 
certainly the people 
in the bank were very co opera
tive. They signed everything 
as though they had cou Œ as 
the mon Œ as though the money had been  coun
ted and everything, or the transaction was 
very orderly. And so my
 father comes to the 
Bokoro s 
house. And th en, wh ere there™s 
another problem they confront is the la
ck of transportation. The Germans had 
requisitioned all means of trans
portation; trucks, taxis, mules,
 horses. And so the brothers 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
28
couldn™t find a way fo r us to leave that day,
 wh ich was October seco
nd. And so we spent 
the night in their house, and the following day they came with a taxi. They found a taxi 
that was going to 
Kremasta
. This was a spa near the river 
Acheloos
 river, nearby. Was 
so-some distance, few kilometers outside 
Agrinion
. And he had Œ the 
taxi driver had 
other passengers to transport to the Œ the the 
Acheloos
 spa. And so this is we Œ we got in  
the taxi with some blankets, and you know, 
some household ma Œ equipment, materials 
that we brought with us, and 
so we left the city. I rememb
er that, I remember h o w my 
mother said we should
 crouch into the Œ the taxi, not to
 draw attention to ourselves, 
because people did not use taxis 
then to Œ to Œ to move aro
und, we didn™t want to Œ to 
draw attention to ourselves. An
d then as soon as we Œ we came
 to the outskirts of the city 
of 
Ag rinion
, we had to pass through a German  checkpoint. And the driver, who 
apparently  did this route quite often, he knew
 how to deal with the German guards there, 
and he gave them some raisins and cigare
ttes, and they let us pass. And then Œ 
Q: Without checking you. 
A: Without checking, yes. It was Œ was actu
ally, you know, we Œ we learned much later 
that at that point, it was easy to
 go in and out of the cities, 
th-they were not checking. But 
then Œ a-and then a few kilometers later, we
 encountered  another ch
eckpoint that was not 
German, those were the resistance fighters. These were the 
EAM-ELAS
 memb ers. An d  
then, you know, we reassured th
at we were in safe ground. 
Q: Was your brother a memb er of 
ELAS
? 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

29
A: No, my  brother Œ 
Q: Because it was Œ 

A: Œ was very young then, he 
was 13. He wished he were. Th
at was the dream of his life, 
he Œ to th is Œ to this day, he wished  he ha
d had Œ had had the opport
unity  to b Œ to be a 
memb er o f  
ELAS
. There was a Œ a youth divi
sion of the resistance called 
EPON
, 
e-p-o-
n
. 
Q: Right. 
A: And they were Œ these were mostly yo
ung men and women. They were 15 - 16 years 
old. They  were Œ they were doing very va
luable services, carryi
ng out very valuable 
services for the resistance. 
They  were used as runners, 
to Œ to carry messages for 
communication purposes. They w
ould paint slogans in the c
ities at n ight, to lift up the 
spirits of the citizens. And th
en in the villages, where peopl
e didn™t have radios, they 
would call out or read the news of the day,
 using a megaphone, like it was taken probably 
from gramophones, and Œ like a bullhorn, carry 
Œ you know, shouting the news, or if Œ if 

there was th Œ if the s Œ the village had to 
be evacuated, they wo
uld Œ they would carry 
out this service, very valuable. But no, 
my  Œ my  brother never had th e opportunity. 
Q: When you were in this taxi
, did Œ did you feel the tensi
on? Do  you rememb er feeling a 
lot of tension, or not? 
A: No, for me it was wonderful, because ridi
ng in a taxi was a unique experien ce. People 
did not ride buses a
nd taxis in Œ in Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

30
Q: Right. 
A: Œ in the city where I gr
ew up. And being in  moving ve
hicle, no matter what it was, 
whether it was a 
Jeep
 or a bus or a taxi, didn™t matte
r, it was a thrilling experience. And 
so I remember it was Œ it was a w o nderful fee
ling that I had being in the taxi. And then  

the anticipation of going up 
to the mountains, these are mo
untains that I could see from 
the city, the Œ you could see 
them from the city, and I alwa
ys wanted to go there. 
Q: So fo r you was an adventure Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in a way. 

A: Yes, yes, an adventure. 
Q: And for your parents, it™s not
 quite an adventure, right? 
A: No, it™s a difference Œ 
Q: Or if it™s an adv Œ a diffe
rent kind of adventure, yes. 
A: Right, right, right. It was a Œ actually a 
very beau tiful ride, up to a certain point, the Œ 
the road was paved, and so we were 
able to go as far as the village of 
Houni
, and Œ and 
there, this is as far as the ta
xi could go. And th is is another thing that I rememb er, and it™s 

a firsthand recollection, this very beautiful fo
untain that consisted of heads made out of 
kind of Œ some kind of ceramic material, an
d the water was spouting out of these heads. I 

don™t know, maybe there were seven or eight 
heads in a row. And e Œ thou Œ that Œ this 
was a fountain that was also built by Italians. But 
this is as far as the taxi went, then he 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

31
had Œ he Œ he transporte
d his passengers to the Œ the spa. And at that point, the driver, the 
taxi driver found a Œ a mule driver to tran
sport us to a village. Now, I don™t know who 
made the decision that 
Psilovrahos
 was the village where we should be taken. I don™t 
know whether it was the taxi driver recommende
d it, or Œ or the mu le driver thought that 
this would be Œ but he
 Œ but the Œ the information that 
was conveyed to the mu le driver 
was that it had to be a place that was off th
e beaten track, a remo
te village, and so the 
mule driver brought two mules and a donkey
 to transport us to
 the Œ the village. 
Q: So you don™t think that yo
ur parents, before you left 
Agrinion
 were quite sure where 
they were gonna go? 
A: I Œ I Œ 
Q: They knew the direction,
 but not necessarily where. 
A: I really don™t know, I don™t even know wh ether the 
Bokoro s
 brothers had told the taxi 
driver th-th-this is the final destin
ation. I Œ I Œ I™m not clear on that. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Yes. 
Q: So you get out of th
e taxi with the few things that you™re carrying. 
A: Right. 
Q: And you get on a donkey,
 or a mu  Œ or a mu le? 
A: Not exactly. 

Q: No? Do you walk ? What happens?  

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
32
A: My Œ the mu le driver and 
my father, they load all our 
belongings onto these mu les. 
And we carry these rugs, they™re 
used as blankets, they™re called 
flokati
. 
Flokati
. It™s 
tufted blanket. Very heavy. Very  heavy. I think th e 
United States
, they use it as a rug, a 
very elegant rug by the fireplace, but it Œ it ha
s these tufts, very long ones. And it™s made 
of wool, very heavy, and so  they lo ad a
ll our belongings on th ese two mu les, and they 
cover the mule with this tufted blankets, andthey create sort of like a nest for me. And 

they lifted me up and they place me on the mule
 in this Œ in this 
little nest that they 
created. And then my mo
ther was riding th e other mu le, a
nd my  brother rode the donkey  
for a little while, and my father on foot. So 
that was the scene. And there we are, 
following this path that is Œ it™s a Œ it™s a pa
th that only animals and people can walk on. 
It™s very rocky, I remember. 
And I remember a very Œ the r
hythmic sound of a creek that 
was flowing along this path. That I reme mb e
r. This is probably why I love mo untains, 
because of Œ of my experience 
in the mountains during this pe
riod of my life. I don™t like 
the sea very mu ch, but I love the mountains, yes. 
Q: Why don™t we stop there Œ 
A: Sure. 

Q: Œ and change the tape, okay.

Q: When  Œ when  we closed the tape the la
st time, you were talking about being put in 
that nest, an-and being taken by the 
Œ you were on the donkey . So Œ oh Œ 
A: I was Œ I was on the mule. 
Q: Œ was on the mule, you were on the mule. 

A: My brother was on a donkey. 

Q: Yes. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. And you think that Œ that this expe
rience was beautiful to you, so th at you™re 
very attracted to mountains
 and not the sea, yes? 
A: Yes, yes, very much so. 

Q: Did you fall asleep? 

A: On the mule? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Oh no. 
Q: No. 

A: No, no, I was wide awake and 
I Œ I just Œ I have this very vivid image of this trip up to 
Psilovrahos
. It™s very vivid in my mind; the sounds, the smells. 
Q: So what sort of 
sounds did you hear? 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
34
A: Oh, well, first of all, th
e creek that was flowing along 
the path. The sounds Œ th-the 
sounds that I remember the mo
st are when we were approa
ching the village, there were 
sounds of sheep braying, goats,
 the Œ the bells of Œ of the 
goats. They Œ goats always had 
bells so the villagers can locate them, you 
know, if they straye
d away. And roosters 
crowing. Those are the sou Œ th-the
 Œ the Œ the sounds of the village. 
Q: Did th e mu le also make sounds? The 
mule, and the donkeys, did they bray? 
A: Yeah, de-definitely the 
donkeys. The donkeys do, de
finitely very loud, very 
characteristic loud sound th ey make. And I 
rememb er my  mo ther turning around and 
telling my father, when we were approa
ching the village, we didn™t get tired 
Leon
, did 
we? She was sitting on the mu
le and my poor father was 
perspiring and 
Œ and really 
having a hard time climbing th e Œ this Œ this is
 a very steep mountain we were climbing, 
very steep. 

Q: Right. So  you™re about five years old at this time? 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: So you™re quite cons
cious of wh at™s going Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ wh at™s going on. 
A: Yes, I am. 
Q: Now, did you ex Œ when  the villagers ca Œ 
di-did they come out 
to greet you? I mean, 
what Œ what happened when 
you came into this village?

A: Well, when we came into th
e village, there were villagers that came out, because this 
is a very small, small village 
in a very remote location. No
t many things happen in the 
course of a day, and th-they Œ th ey were 
curious to see who are these people who ju st 
arrived. We looked, obviously, city people, 
the way we were dressed, and so they were 
very curious to Œ to see what was going on. 
Q: Did your parents say that you were Jewish, and that 
you were Œ you were escaping 

from the Germans, or were Œ didn™t you Œ 
don™t you Œ do you reme mb er, do you know? 
A: I don™t know whether my parents told th
e villagers that we were Jewish, but it was 
known, it was known that we were Jewish. 
But we were trying not
 to act Œ you know, 
behave differently than Œ than
 the j Œ than the villagers. We
 were trying not to draw 
attention to ourselves, to the point that we
 even went to  church , to give them the 
impression that, you know, we are like you, 
except that we don™t make the sign of the 

cross. But my  parents knew that Œ that as long as 
EAM-ELAS
 is in control of that region, 
we were safe from spies. Becau
se even if a villager had Œ 
got in his mind the notion of 
betraying us, he would be afraid of retali
ations by the Œ punish me
nt by the resistance. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So we tried to sort of keep a Œ a low 
profile and not look diffe
rent or act different. 
Q: Did you play with th e kids? 

A: Oh, yes. 

Q: You did?

A: Yes, I Œ 
Q: So this was good for you, this was nice. 

A: Yes, it was Œ it was a wa Œ the village ki
ds were Œ village ki
ds all Œ all around us 
because Œ and Œ and it Œ became 
friends with them because my
 father enrolled me, after 
we settled down, enrolled me in the Œ the 
one room schoolhouse of the school. And I 
think it had maybe four classes, fo ur second, 
third, fourth grades, but it was mostly the 
younger children that came to school. The olde
r ones were taken away by th eir parents to 
help out with Œ with the Œ the farms, or to le
arn a trade. So the Œ the educational level of 
the villagers was very, very low. Was an 
extremely poor village, with few exceptions. 
There were a few rich families. 
Q: Do you remember
 going to  school? 
A: Yes, I remember th at very well. 
Q: Oh, what was that like? 

A: Well, I remember Œ first of all, the school
 was a Œ was just a plain building th at had a 
few desks, where the Œ the desk and the seat 
were attached. I think 
they were desks like 
the ones that were used in colonial times in the 
United States
. We had Œ 
Q: Listen, I went to school and they had desks like that. 
A: And they  had them. 
Okay, so I 
should Œ 
Q: This was a long time ago 
[indecipherable]
 to school Œ 
A: Yes, yes, right, it was attached, yes.

Q: Yes. 
A: And you would sit like three children, on
e next to th e Œ the other. And the Œ th e 
teacher was Mr. 
Alexandras
(ph) 
Hemandritis
(ph). And I remember him very well, he 
was a very nice person. When my  father brought
 me to the school the first day, they Œ 

you know, they didn™t have b
ooks, they didn™t have paper, 
it was Œ we Œ we had slates. 
You prob Œ I don™t know if you used slates also? 

Q: No, I didn™t. 
A: Slates. 
Q: Slates. 

A: You know what slates are? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And he didn™t have enough 
books for all the children, so 
he told my father that he 
wouldn™t have a book for me, but Œ but my br
other could Œ could make
 one, he would ju st 
copy one of the books th
at was used Œ that were used in
 the class. There was a fireplace 
for heat, and in fact, every day we had to br
ing a piece of wood, all the children had the 
piece Œ piece of wood for the Œ the fireplace.
 And I was rather uncomfortable at the 
beginning, because of tw
o reasons. One was I looked differe
nt than the village children. I 
Œ you know, my mother fussed ov
er me a lot, I had very  pretty clothes, and a huge bow 
on my  hair; that was the style, andcurls like Œ my  mo ther would say like 
Shirley 
Temple
. And so  I Œ I drew their attention from 
my appearance alone. The worst thing for 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
38
me was that the day would start with the Lord™s Prayer, 
Pater Hemon
. And this is a 
Christian prayer, which after I analyzed it as
 an adult, you know, is very acceptable 
prayer, could say universal prayer. However, 
it had to be Œ was fo
llowed by th e sign of 
the cross, and I did not make the sign of the 
cross. I Œ I did not know mu ch about Jewish 
religion at that point. I knew that I was Je
wish, I knew we celebrated Passover, and I 
knew that on Yom Kippur, we fasted. But 
other than that, I didn™t know anything. 

However, I knew a lot about the Christian re
ligion, because I was growing up in a 
Christian environment, and Œ a
nd Œ and of course I knew abou
t the Œ the accusation of the 
Jews being responsib le fo
r the crucifixion and Œ 
Q: So you knew that at that age? 

A: I knew that Œ I knew that Œ that Œ that th
ere was some thing Œ not Œ not specifically. I di 
Œ perh aps it™s Œ maybe I™m Œ I™m adding in form
ation that I acquired later on. But all I 
knew was that we did not make the sign of th
e cross, and so I did not. And I remember, 

you know, the children turn in
g around and looking at me. I was not making the sign of 
the cross, and I didn™t know 
what to do with my
 hands. I put them behind me, in my 
pockets. I just had no Œ I felt extremely uncom
fortable. And Œ and th
en of course, during 
recess they Œ they asked me a lot of questio
ns, you know, why didn
™t you make the sign 
of the cross? And I s Œ I did Œ ju st don™t make
 it. A-And I didn™t k
now how to answer the 
questions. I was not prepared for th is and I 
guess my  parents never thought of I was going 
to experience this, and Œ and didn™t prepare me.

Q: Did you go home and say, what am
 I supposed  to do now? I me an Œ 
A: Yes, when I went home after the first day,
 I told my mother th
at I wanted to  have 
braids, because all the girls Œ 
Q: Had braids. 
A: Œ had braids. I didn™t want to have curls.
 And she protested, she said, but they™re so 

beautiful, like 
Shirley Temple
. No braids, and no bow. I had a huge bow sitting on top of 
my head. These children had very little, very 
little. Many of these children were barefoot, 
or they wore pigskin sandals, made out of a pi
ece of a pigskin, and yo
u know, rope to Œ to 
tie it to their feet. And I had shiny shoes, and pretty clothes and a bow and curls. All of 

that had to go, I told  my  mo ther and sist
er, because I Œ children don™t want to be 
different. 
Q: Mm-hm. Right.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So th at was a Œ was that a difficu lt time for you in  a certain way, or do Œ 
A: It was uncomfortable, uncomfortable that 
I Œ I made friends easily and they accepted 
me no matter what I looked or how I acted. An
-A nd I made friends, I Œ I Œ I Œ I never felt 
lonely, you know. There were tim
es when I did, when  I did, later on. And I used to go up 
in the Œ the fields, you know
, my Œ our house was Œ our house was a very primitive 
looking house. It was really Œ consisted 
of one room with a fireplace and an 
[indecipherable]
 window, and a table and Œ and ch
airs. There were no beds. I mean, 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

when  we arrived, my  parents had to imme
diately buy wood sawhor
ses and boards to 
make beds, two beds; one fo r my  mo ther and 
me, and one for my  father and my brother. 
And then  of course, they had to purchase food
 supplies. This was the harvest time, this is 
October and there are dry figs and walnutsand corn, lentils, beans, dry beans and my 
parents immediately bought food supplies. 

Q: A-And from whom did they  buy it? Th
ey  Œ they buy it from 
the farmers, or Œ 
A: Yes. Th-There were two sources of Œ of 
sa Œ food supplies. One was we Œ my  parents 
had, as I said earlier, they had stored a lot of
 food in the Œ the bank. And so they  send a 

man with a horse to bring fo od supplies from 
Œ from ours Œ our supplie
s in storage in the 
bank. And the other food su pplies were from th
e villagers. There were some that were 
very affluent and they would 
Œ would sell in large quantities. And so my parents stuffed a 
lot of stacks of these food supplies and arrang ed them up against the wall, and it formed 

sort of a sofa. And so we had a place to sit 
and we had the table an
d chairs and beds to 
sleep on. But that was all. There was no ru
nning water, no electricity, no bathroom. Bu t 
my father was a very resource Œ resourceful pe
rson, he Œ he said just Œ just let™s pretend 

we are living in primitive times, b efore electric
ity was invented, and we just have to Œ to 
learn from the villagers how they
 live, and we™ll do the same. 
Q: And how Œ do you know how th
ey found this place to live? 
A: The Œ the first place we lived in, you know,
 when we arrived, and there were villagers 
that approached to see what 
was going on, one of them st
epped forward and said , oh, I

have a room, and they Œ and they rented Œ 
we rented a room. The Œ one thing that my  
mother had brought, she insisted
 that we bring to  the village was soap and sugar, because 
the Œ the Greek money had lost its value be
cause of inflation th
at the Germans had 
printed a lot of money, and the ger Œ the Gr
eek drachma had lost its value, so people 
conducted these transactions w
ith goods, with bartering th
at was going on. So so ap and 
sugar was a very desirable, important commod
ity, and we had brought a lot of that, yeah. 
Q: Interesting that 
she thought of that. 
A: Yeah, she was a very sm
art person, very  smart. 
Q: So you stayed in this 
first place for a little while? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Like wa Œ like a couple of weeks 
or something, or less than that? 
A: Well, we stayed in Œ you see, after we 
Œ we Œ we purchased fo
od, and we also Œ we 
got a goat. Now, I™m not sure whether we go
t a goat at this point, or later on, I™m not 
sure. But I remember that for 
me, getting a goat was the dream of my life. It was a goat of 
my  own, and the Œ and it was really a Œ in orde
r for us to have a source of milk. And th-
the goat spent most of the time w ith the 
Tsulamitsu
(ph) family, they were very nice, 
very hospitable, kind, generous
 people. And they spen t the 
time there, they would milk 
the goat and bring the milk for us to drink. 
Bu t we also, you know, 
I spent a lot of time 
with Œ with the goat, I Œ I really became very
 attached to her. So after we Œ we acquired 
all these fo od su pplies, we felt very comfortabl
e in the village. It felt like a vacation. I

was going to  school, my  brother had brought hi
s high school books, and my  father said, 
you should start studying. And 
my  father had brought a book
 of English method Œ how Œ 
a method to learn English without a teacher. 
I reme mb er that book. My brother has it Œ 
still has it. And Œ and 
of course my mother didn™t need
 any Œ any additional work. She 
really had to wo rk very hard  because ther
e was Œ she had to do the laundry and the 
cooking and all the washing of the dishes
, without Œ without a stove, without running 
water. It was a real hardship for her. And so 
we didn™t felt comfortable at that point, and 
my father started writing letters to our rel-relatives in 
Ioannina
, urging th em to leave the 
city and Œ and go to the mount
ains. And we used friends t-to
 Œ to transport these letters 
from Œ from the village of 
Psilovrahos
 to a colleague of my father™s, 
Evyanea
(ph) 
P apa da poulo u
(ph) I believe was her name. And she would in turn send the letters to her 
sister or brother in 
Ioannina
, and they would deliver th
em to our relatives. And 
everything was written in code, 
and we never used the word 
Psilovrahos
, it was our Œ it 
was a code word  like, our place in the mountai
ns, or our vacation place. And so we were 
urging th em to leave, and the reply was that 
everything is fine here
. We have plenty of 
food, and they were actually
 worried about the children 
catching cold up in the 
mountains, because at that time, th e ger Œ th
ere Œ there was no indication of anything was 
going to  happen to them now. 
Ioannina
, or 
Io annina
 at this point is occupied by the 
Germans, but there was no indication that anyt
hing bad was going to 
happen. So Œ so we 
felt very secure in the village, and we actu
ally began to enjoy our life there, vacation

spot, until suddenly it was Œ I believe it wa
s November, the end of November, when 
Yonas Mionis
, this is the same man Œ 
Q: Same guy, yeah. 
A: Œ same guy, he comes Œ he 
Œ he Œ he was Œ he had been 
running, he Œ he Œ he Œ he 
arrived to the village, and from anot
her Œ another village called ios Œ 
Agios Vlassis
, a 
nearby village, and told my parents that we have to leave and find another place, we have 

to leave the village immediately, or Œ or 
by Œ by tomo rrow morni
ng, and go to another 
place, because the Germans have adva
nced to Œ ar-are-are Œ are in 
Agio s Vlassis
, and 
they are advancing in the direction of 
Psilovrahos
. By that time there were two more 
Jewish men who had ended up in 
Psilovrahos
, they had come from another city, I believe 
Helkese
(ph). And of course you know we were Œ 
my parents, they pa
nicked. They Œ they 
were advised to go to a higher place up in 
the mountains. And we arranged with  a mu le 
driver to come the followi
ng mo rn ing, to transport us to this higher place. And I 
remember th-the Œ oh well, dur
ing the night Œ during the night
, was a very frightful night, 
because we didn™t know whet her the Germans were advancin
g during the night, but there 
was a big explosion, a distant explosion. 
We didn™t know wher
e it was coming from. I 
should say that when 
Yonas Mionis
 came to alert us of the 
advance of the Germans, 
there was there Œ the church bells starte
d to ring alarm, and th ese young men of 
EPON
 
was calling everybody to his fe
et, and urging able-bodied me
n to take their weapons, 
rifles, whatever they
 had, and go to 
Ag io s
 
Vlassis
 to stop advance of the Germans. So,

the following morning, this mu
le driver arrives and Œ and now ag ain, I don™t know 
whether I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that mu ch later, but it impressed 
me that these Œ what kind of mules are these?
 These are just a Œ they look like big Œ big 
dogs; they were very small. And of course, we
 were very grateful that there was a means 
of transportation, so we loaded a few Œ a few 
things and along with 
the other Jewish men, 
we started climbing the mountain. Now, this
 part I know is firsthand experience. I 
remember my mother sayingŒ I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep 
walking, keep walking, you have to Œ beca
use I was behind ev erybo
dy. And I don™t know 
whether she said the Germans ar
e coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster. And 
so it Œ it was a Œ it was a rainy day, and I reme
mb er my  mo th er in sist
ed that we all wear 
extra clothing fo r warmth, and finally we reache
d a house, this mule dr
iver took us to the 
house of a man called 
Chia ndafelis
(ph). It was a Œ th-there were no other houses there, 
just his house. And of course, he opens the door, sees this 
unlikely group of people, city 
people at his doorstep, he didn™t know wh at
 was going on. And Œ and it was revealed that 
Œ that wi Œ th-the Œ the mu le
 driver told him who we were
 and why we were there. So 
they probab ly Œ he probably to ld them that
 we are Jewish, and th at the Germans were 
advancing. I Œ I don™t know exactly wh at
 he told him. But 
when the man, Mr. 
Chia ndafelis
(ph) heard the wo rd
 Agrinion
, he became very excite
d, because he told us 
that his daughter 
Theandafela
(ph) was working for a family in 
Agrinion
, the family of 
Davaroukas
(ph). And it so happened that 
Da va ro uka s
(ph) was a colleague of my  

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
45
father™s in the National Bank of 
Greece
. So he became very exc
ited, because my  father 
told him, oh I know your da
ughter, she came to the bank se
veral times, and I know her, 
she is a very nice girl. And you see, a lot of 
villagers would send their daughters into the 
city to work as maids 
in hope that they would learn to
 grow Œ to learn Œ acquire some 
skills with city people. They would take th
em out of school and 
they would work as 
maids to bring some income fo
r the fami ly, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the 
way city people were. So he 
welcomed us, you know, from st
rangers we became friends. 
He welcomed us and Œ and o
ffered us a place to Œ to sleep. The Greeks are very 
hospitable people. 

Q: Even Œ even
 in danger. 
A: Even in danger, it™s Œ it™s a 
Œ it™s a traditio n, and i-in fact
, in danger, they Œ they sense 
that there is a common enemy, and we have 
to help one another. And that was from my  
mother™s memoirs, when she describes her many 
visits into the countr
yside, this is the 
feeling that I get, that the people were we
lcoming. The-They  saw this woman and her 
son, because she would go around with my  br
other, and they™d  try to help as mu ch as 
they can. So we make arrangements 
to Œ to spend the night in Mr. 
Chiandafelis™
(ph) 
house. And then the next mo rning Œ or rather
 it was, perhaps Œ no, I think it was the same 
day; it was raining an d then wh
en the rain stopped, we stepped outside. And it was at that 
point that my  brother saw a group of men w
ith horses or mu les, ascending the mountain. 
And Œ and he said, the Germans are coming,
 the Germans are comin g . And that, you

know, created panic, and ev erybody ju st disp
ersed and hid behind rocks, behind trees. 
And then the 
Chiandafelis
(ph) re-realized that we were terrified by the Germans. And so 
at this point they decide that it™s b est
 for us to spend the day in a cave. In 
Arapo
(ph)
 
Kefalas
(p h) was the name of the cave, and sp end 
the day in Œ and spend the night in his 
house. And that™s what we did.

Q: I want to go back a little 
bit, right before the cave, wh
en you™ve tra Œ when you™re 
traveling Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ to go to  the cave, do you reme
mb er what you brought with you? 
A: Yes, we Œ we brought some blankets, soap
 and sugar, in pillowcases, because as I said 
earlier, my mother used
 the soap  and sugar to barter ot
her items. A nd in this case, we 
didn™t know wh Œ where we were going, bu
t this was a way of paying th e people in 
whose house we were gonna stay, soap or sugar.  
Q: But I wa Œ I was interested to know whethe
r you as a child brought Œ brought a toy of 
some kind, would you Œ would 
you bring one of the dolls 
that your brother had made? 
A: Oh yes, no, I didn™t have
 any toys. I do not reme mb er ha
ving any toys. I really did not 
have toys. And I didn™t miss them because none of th
e village children had toys. 
Q: Had to ys. 
A: Yes, we Œ it was always improvising th ings
. I remember one of th
e activities I used to 
engage in was build ing a clay oven, like the 
one my  Œ a small one, like the one my  father 
had built, cause I had helped
 him build the clay oven 
on the side of the house. 
Q: This was in a Œ 
Agrinion
, or Œ 
A: Oh, no, no, no, no Œ 
Q: No, th is was Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

48
A: Œ in 
Agrinion
 we lived in a Œ a Œ 
Q: In a regular house. 
A: Œ in a regular house with running water, 
and bathro om and a stove. But no, in the 
village. So my Œ I remember my
 father built a clay oven and 
Œ and I know exactly how to 
build  a clay oven. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. If you want me to build  one for you, I can do it. 
Q: You can do that? 
A: Yes. 

Q: So you helped him do th is? 
A: Yes, all I had to do was I ha
d to gather rocks, and there were plenty of ro ck s, because 
this village is just covered with rocks. And so
 he made a Œ a mound of rocks, and then he 
dug up the soil and extracted some clay, mix ed 
it with hay to reinforce the Œ the mud, and 
then Œ oh we Œ we piled the rock s on th e top of
 the Œ a large flagston
e. You pile the rocks 
and then  you cover the rocks with th is mixt
ure of clay and hay. And so you create a 
dome, and there™s two o Œ there 
are two openings, one in front 
to put the food in, and out, 
and then  one at the top for the smoke to escape
. And so  when  the clay is dry, you remove 
the rocks from inside and you cr
eate this hollow space, and you 
use wood to sh Œ heat up 
the oven, and th is is how yo
u Œ you bake th ings, and Œ 
Q: So did your mo th er ba
ke in th ere? She Œ she Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
49
A: Yes, yes Œ 
Q: Œ and she cooked food? 

A: Yes, there was the only way to cook, to ba
ke something. We had the fireplace in Œ ins 
Œ in the room, and at first sh e used the Œ what they call a 
gastra
. It™s Œ it™s a metal dome 
piece of like Œ well, the Œ the cover of a pot, but
 fairly large, and you light the fire and 
then you, in the hot ashes and th e smoldering 
charcoal, you can bake 
something, provided  
you have this 
gastra
 on top of it, because it keeps the heat inside. 
Q: Right. 

A: But in a Œ I believe 
gastra
 was something that we borro
wed from Œ from the villagers. 
Villagers were very generous, very helpful, th
e Œ they realized that we were not equipped 
for this kind of life, and they
 were willing to share their tool
s or Œ or kitchen materials of 
Œ to Œ to  help us manage. But fo r some reason this 
gastra
 had to be re
turned to the 
villager and so Œ so  my father had to construc
t this oven. It was not his invention, it was 
very common and I™m sure the villagers told 
him how to construct 
one. But my father 
was always interested in learning things an
d experimenting with di
fferent devices. So Œ 
so, going up to the Œ so really
, I did not have any toys, but th
is is Œ so I used to build 
small ovens fol Œ following that model. 
Q: Right, right, with  other kids. 
A: With other kids, yes. 

Q: And did you do anything
 with these little o v ens?

A: Yes, we Œ I wanted to light a fire, but 
of course, you know, my  mo ther, you know, was 
absolutely against it,
 because it was dangerous. At so
me point in my life, in my 
childhood, I did light a fire. I was fascinated
 by th is Œ by these Œ this structure of the 
oven. 
Q: Right. 

A: And after the war, I think Œ I know that I Œ I 
lit a fire in there. It™s quite interesting, 
yes. 
Q: It™s interesting, right.
 But you didn™t bri
ng any of those little 
doll Œ like one doll Œ 
A: No, no Œ  
Q: Œ noth ing. You Œ you Œ you we
re not attached to anything?  
A: No, not really. 

Q: It™s interesting. 

A: Yes. The thing that I was attached, in th
e village, was this goat. I Œ I really was Œ 
became very attached to that animal. 
Q: So did you miss the animal when you left? 
A: Actually, I missed this animal
 when it had to be killed, beca
use at the later point in our 
stay in Œ in the village, the Œ 
the goat became sick and had to 
be slaughtered. And so they 
killed the goat and I wa Œ I was really Œ I d
on™t think my parents realized how devastated 
I was. I was a rather quiet child that didn™t sh
are my  feelings or talk about things. I don™t 
think I did. And so when they 
killed the goat, they Œ the village
rs told us that you have to

cut it into small pieces, and put it in a barrel w
ith a lot of salt to pres
erve it for the winter. 
And that™s what we did. And th  Œ it turn
ed out that the goat was pregnant, so Œ 
Q: Not sick? 
A: Not sick, or perhap s it was both, and my  fa
ther threw away the fe
tus, but one of the Œ 
the Jewish men in the village, those that had jo
ined us at a la Œ later point, was told that 
the fetus was thrown away, and 
he was starving, literally starvi
ng, and he went, picked up 
the dead fetus, 
cooked it and Œ and they ate it.  
Q: Could you eat this goat? 
A: The goat? Yes Œ 

Q: You could. 
A: Œ it™s regular meat. 
Q: No, I mean, given your feelings about it Œ 

A: Oh. 

Q: Œ I was wondering whether you could Œ 
A: Oh, yes. I-I don™t think I refused the me
at. I was so hungry and by then it was no 
longer a goat, it was just a piece o f extrem
ely  salty meat, it wasn™t even palatable. 
Q: Let me ask you something, 
cause you said that you were
 a quiet child. Do you think 
that you became a quiet child because what
 was going on around yo
u was so difficult, 
and you thought that maybe you should
n™t speak what you were feeling?

A: I know th at my  parents many times descri
bed situations where I was hungry or very 
thirsty, and they said, but 
Ninetta
 did not complain. So I do
n™t know wh at was going on 
through my mind that we were Œ had all thes
e hardship s, and there™s nothing that can be 
done. 
Q: Right. 

A: So I Œ it™s very hard for me
 to Œ to know Œ I don™t think 
that the Œ the war experience 
affected me in the way that made me fright
ened and made me quiet, because for me, the 
experience of Œ of living in this village, 
where I was free, I was really free to go 

anywhere I wanted as a child, 
surrounded by this wild
 beauty of the village; the animals, 
goats and sheep and donkeys an
d chickens everywhere. It was Œ it was Œ it was a positive 
experience, and I think Œ I have a feeling that 
this is where I develo
ped my  Œ my  love for 
nature. I Œ I Œ I just Œ cause I was so close to
 nature, so close to 
the animals, to this 
wilderness. So I don™t think it had a negative impact on me. 
Q: Doesn™t seem like it Œ 
A: No, cause Œ 
Q: Œ wh en one meets you. Right. But you don
™t Œ you know, one do
esn™t know whether 
we Œ wh en you talked about 
the fact that you didn™t express your feelings about some 
things, so they didn™t
 know wh at you felt Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ that maybe that was a Œ that was par
tly a response to how difficult you saw that.

A: And Œ and Œ and so, 
really a designation of a survivor, a survivor, it had never entered

ed hiding in Œ in th e Œ

 have to Œ we didn™t have to hide, really, 
during th at period.

the word su rvivor has

Interview with Ninetta Feldman

A: N-No , we are going to this man™s house. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And this is Mr. 
Chiandafelis
(ph) Œ 
Q: Right, who had the dau Œ th
e daughter who Œ who Œ so he
 was very comfortable with 
all of you. 

A: Yes, yes. But then there was this incident
 of my  brother seeing 
this group of men and 
horses or mu les ascending this precipice and 
she panicked  and said, oh th e Germans are 
coming, and created a lot of panic among all 
of us, because in addition to my family, 
there were now three additional Jewish men; one of them was 
Yonas Mionis
, the 
resistance leader. And we all dispersed behind 
rock s, behind trees and th at is when Œ oh, 
and then Mr. 
Chiandafelis
(ph) sent his son, 
Spyros
 down the mountain to see who these 
people were and he discovere
d just villagers returning to
 their homes. But then they 
recognized that we were terri
fied of the possibility of bein
g discovered by the Germans, 
and so they rec Œ 
Chiandafelis
(ph) recomme nded that we spend th e day in th is cave, 
called 
Arapo
(ph).
 Kefalas
(ph), and Œ and the night at his 
house. And th at™s exactly what 
we did, th is 
Spyros
, Mr. 
Chiandafelis™
 son guided us to the Œ to
 the cave, and that again, 
I have a firsthand recollection. I remember this
 very vividly as a child going into a cave. 
It was quite an experience, and I was Œ I was 
frightened. I was frightened at first, because 
it was so dark, especially, you k
now, before our eyes adjusted 
to the darkness, it was very 
dark, and th ere was all kinds of formations of
 stalactites and stalagmites. And my father 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
56
found a little ledge on the side, sort of halfwa
y into the cave. It was like an alcove, and 
we spread the blankets, and the 
four of us huddled  together 
in this dark cave. And Œ and 
my  father, he Œ he always tried to calm ever
ybody down , and Œ and he Œ this a Œ he™s a Œ 
was a very good storyteller. So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his 

exploits, ab Œ as a soldier goi
ng up to the Œ to the front, 
the Albanian  Œ Greek Albanian 
front or Œ and then Bible stor
ies, lots of Bible stories, 
which he embellished greatly to 
entertain us. And I don™t know whether this is
 Œ actually happened . I don™t know he Œ he 
Œ he Œ whether he explained to
 m Œ to us how these structur
es are formed in the cave. I-I 
don™t rememb er whether he explained, but I 
have a feeling that he did, but I™m not 
positive. And so , it was hours that we had to s 
Œ to spend in this al
cove, in the dark Œ 
semi-darkness. We could hear the dripping of
 the water in the back, as the water mixed 
with minerals, would drip down in to a Œ a 
pond at the bottom of the Œ of the cave. And 
then suddenly we h
ear somebody call my  father, you know, Mr. 
Ma tsa s
, Mr.
 Matsas
. 
And we were frightened because we thou
ght somebody discovere
d us. And so we 
decided not to Œ to say anything, to ke
ep quiet. But the voice persisted, Mr. 
Matsas
, Mr. 
Matsas
, then he said I™m Œ this is 
Spyros
. Come out, come out, it™s safe, it™s calm, this is 
Spyros
, 
Chiandafelis™
(ph) son. And Œ and I don™t rememb
er whether we came out, or the 
people outside came in, I don™t rememb er. But la ter on my  father said that he was afraid 

at first that they were going 
to throw a grenade, because at
 first we thought there were 
Germans, enemies. But what we discovered 
when  we Œ we met th
e twopeople that 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
57
Spyros
 had brought there, these were two othe
r Jewish men who were seeking shelter, 
like we were. They were in 
Agios Vlassis
 and when  the Germans a
dvanced, at that point 
they left and they came to 
Psilovrahos
, and then they were told th
at this Jewish family up 
Œ there™s another family up in Œ hiding 
up higher in the mountains. So now Mr. 
Chia ndafelis
(ph) had several people to feed every ni
ght. But we decided that the villa Œ 
the Œ the cave was not safe eithe
r, so my father searched in th
e forest for a secluded place. 
And so we decided to  spend the day in this se
cluded place, and the ni
ghts at the house.  
Q: So was it Œ was it your father who deci
ded that it was not a safe place? And why 
would he decide th
at, do you th ink? 
A: Because it was a place that was known by th
e villagers. This is not a cave, a remote 
cave that nobody knows 
about. He felt that it was known 
and it™s best for the duration, 
you know, while the Germans were in 
Psilovrahos
, because they did come Œ 
Q: They came to the 
town. They came from 
Psilovrahos
. 
A: Œ they  did come to 
Psilovrahos
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It is best for us to be in a pl
ace that nobody knew, except perhaps
 Spyros
 and his 
father.  
Q: Right, right. 
A: And so I ev Œ again, I reme mb er this 
secluded place. It was Œ it was undern eath a 
protruding rock, to protect us 
from the rain. And so we Œ they
 gathered branches for trees 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
58
to Œ to create a camouflage the opening. And 
so again we huddled together, the four of 
us.  
Q: Was this another cave, or this is actually outside? 
A: It™s outside. 
Q: It™s outside. 

A: It™s outside, but there™s a rock, a very larg
e rock that protrudes, creating a roof, and so 
we Œ we sat underneath and we 
blocked the opening with Œ with
 branches of fir trees and 
whatever other materials that 
we™re able to find. And we st
and Œ we actually stand seven 
or eight day Œ days. 

Q: So you wou Œ would you go back Œ 
A: Yes Œ 
Q: And Œ at night Œ 

A: Œ at night. At night we go back  to Mr.
 Chiandafelis
(ph) house, and 
Spy ros
 would 
give us some bread and olives or cheese fo
r the day. And at night he would prepare a 
meal. He acted like a waiter. He Œ his Œ Mr. 
Chia ndafelis
(ph) was very proud of his son, 
and 
Spyros
 sort of rose to the occasion, and 
he prepared bean soup, lentil soup or 
chickpea soup. That was the kind of food the 
villagers would eat. It
 wouldhave meat 
perhaps once a week, or once ever
y two weeks, if they could 
find it. And then we would 
spend the night on the floor. Th
ere were several people now. And then during the day, go 
back to that shelter.

Q: A-An -And Œ and wh ere did these men, thes
e ex Œ th-the two Œ is it two or three Œ 
A: Yeah, there were Œ actually 
at one point there were five. 
Q: So where did they  go during the day? 
A: They Œ two of them decided that it wasn
™t safe for them to
 Œ to be even in 
Psilovrahos
, maybe another village is safer. But 
later on they returned, because the 
situation was not as good th ere as well. So, 
eventually there were only three additional 
Jewish men that stayed in the village, plus 
the wife of one of them. Her name was orea Œ 
Aureo
(ph )  
Ze elavee
(ph). Now, these people were not 
ordinary  people. One of them, 
Aron
(ph) 
Romano
(ph) was a ship owner, very wealthy.
 And the other was an owner of a 
private bank. And 
Aron
(ph)
 Ro ma no
(ph) always carried a little briefcase, which we 
thought was probably Œ contained gold coins, but
 did not want to use them, didn™t want to 
reveal that he had gold. So he preferred to 
starve, because he didn™t have the resources 
that we had; sugar and soap and oil,
 to barter for other items to eat. 
Q: Did Œ did your parents barter with the pe
rson th at Œ that had this house wh ere you 
were staying in Œ in  at nights, so they gave them Œ 

A: Yes, when we Œ you know, at the end of th
e eight days when  Œ th at was the period th at 
the Germans stayed in 
the village, my parents gave him 
sugar. This is how we paid. And 
he was a very hospitable person, a very, very  hard life. 

Q: It™s interesting, because everywhere you 
go, it appears as if people are willing to help. 
A: Yes, yes.

Q: And it Œ it™s Œ you™re not 
turn ed away 
by anybody. 
A: True. 
Q: It™s Œ 
A: There is Œ that is the truth. There was one
 family Œ actually he happened to  be one of 
the wealthiest people, who were not very he
lpful. There was a time when  he could have 
helped us tremendously to 
avoid experiencing 
literally starvation 
during the winter, 
because there was Œ well, I think I should 
tell you this part later in the story. 

Q: Okay . 
A: But Œ but he was the excep
tion. Th-The villagers were ve
ry helpful, very helpful. 
Q: So Œ but you had no idea th
at the Germans were only going 
to stay in the village for 
eight days Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ clearly, cause they coul
d have stayed for a month. 
A: True, true. 
Q: Right? 
A: Yes. 

Q: But after eight days they left. And who to
ld you th at they left, so you could get out? 
Do you rememb er?  

A: The Œ the driver of the mules, who actua
lly returned after he 
dropped us off, he 
returned to the village, he cam
e back to get us. And so we 
knew that it was time to come 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

61
back, that th-the Œ the Œ the Germans had left
 the village. But at th
e same time, the rumor 
circulated that Œ that the Germans, who ha
d actually occupied th e room, our room, had 
looted our room that Œ yo
u know, they looted Mr.
 Matsas™ 
room, the Germans did. This 
was the rumor that circulated. 
And so when we retu
rned, soon as we re
turned, before we 
even entered the house Œ this is the story th
at I learned later on, the owner of the house 
came and said, you know, the Germans occupied
 the room, and they  looted your house. 
They ate whatever you had, 
and they took away the rema
inder. And so we entered the 
room, and everything was in disarray and 
all the food was gone. And th ere was a 
substantial supply of 
food, you know, sacks of
 all sorts of things. And so w-we became Œ 
we panick ed . Especially my  mo
ther, what is going to  happen, 
because this is the end of 
Novemb er, actually was probably already De
cember and the winter is coming. The 
harvest is over, there™s no possibi
lity of us buying food from 
the villagers or elsewhere. 
So Œ so my father tried to
 calm her down, saying well, we™ll send a man down  to 
Agrinion
, we have a lot of food in the bank Œ 
End of Tape Four

Beginn ing Tape Five 
Q: Okay, so you come 
back to the village Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and you find out that your stuff has be
en looted, and your mo ther is very upset. 
A: Very upset, and winter is
 comi ng and sources of food are 
scarce. And my  father tried 
to calm her down, that we will send a ma
n down in the village, in the Œ in 
Ag rinio n
 to  g e t 
some food from the bank. And this is some thi
ng we did, but the man came back with one 
small ca Œ one can of oil, that was all he 
could bring, because 
he was bringing food 
supplies for his family, and that was the only 
additional weight for the mule to carry. But 
I was friends with the Œ the child
ren of the owner of th e house, and they told  me one day, 
oh Œ they  were boasting, oh, we have so mu
ch food now. We have rice and bean s, we 
have Œ we even have candles. 
We have things that we ne
ver had befo re. And I Œ I was 
very impressed, and I reported th is to my  pare
nts, you know, I said the Œ my friends, they 

told me they have all this 
good stuff. And immediately my
 parents suspected that the 
owner of the house was the one who looted  th
e room, and my father confronted him, and 
he denied that he Œ he took 
anything. And my  father persiste
d, and he had to accept to Œ 
the fact that Œ he had to admit that he did ta
ke a few things. He was afraid of my father 
talking about this to the village, and that 
he was going to be embarrassed. And so he 
returned a few items. But my parents knew th
at he probably had a lot mo re, and was 

hidden so mewhere. And so my father searched
 the Œ th e barn and other hidden  Œ possible 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
63
places where he could have hidden food, and su
re enough they Œ he 
found a can of oil. 
And oil was a real treasure, because was Œ this 
is olive oil, was very hard to find, very 
valuable, if you were going to use it as a 
commodity to ex change it for other kinds of 
food. So my parents were infuri
ated with this man because he 
Œ he really Œ he created the 
situation that we Œ we were trying to avoid, a
nd that is lack of food 
in the winter. So they 
considered  bringing this matter
 to the people™s court. There 
were people™s courts then, in 
villages. They were not official courts, but 
they were Œ consisted 
of the elders of the 
village, and all sorts of ma Œ matters of Œ di
sputes were brought to the people™s court. 
And the people™s court was actually very severe
 in punishments that 
Œ that they imposed 
on people. So my  parents reconsidered that, 
because they were afraid he would be, who 
knows, imprisoned, or some very severe pu
nishment; he had a young family, so they 
decided to  drop the matter. And that they also
 didn™t want to draw  attention to ourselves. 
So they  dropped the matter, and at this point 
we had to  leave that room, and we went to 
another house to live in. This wa s very similar to the one we 
occupied the first time. This 
one had two rooms, one room was a 
ka fenei o
, a café. And th e other room was the room 
that we occupied , and th Œ and it had a base
ment. And so Œ so that was a big change, it 
was Œ we adjusted to it very quickly. Bu
t the main concern now 
was food. There was a 
family by the name 
Yovanos
(ph) who lived in 
Ag rinion
, but had come to the village for 
the summer, and they stayed on
 because of the Œ the war situ
ation. But they had decided 
to return to 
Agrinion
. And they had a lot of wheat with 
them. So my father, being a bank 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
64
employee, he conducted a transaction not with  
checks, but with wheat.
 He told him, if 
you give us your wh eat that 
is here, you can co llect our wh
eat, which is stored in the 
bank. It was an exchange, andno wheat had to travel to 
Agrinion
 or from 
Agrinion
 to  
Psilovrahos
, but it was a transact i on that s-se emed 
reasonable to him, and he gave us a 
certain amo unt of wheat. But he had more whea
t, but this other villager that was wealthy, 
who could have cooperated at this poi
nt and Œ and he co
uld have made the 
Yov a no s
(ph) 
wheat available to us, he deci
ded not to do that, and he ke
pt the wheat for Œ for himself. 
And that was a very callous thing to do, and 
he, years later when Œ after the war, the man 
recognized that he had done so
mething very , very bad, and he
 came to my father and my 
parents and Œ and asked them for their forgiv
eness, because by Œ by not
 agreeing to make 
this wheat available to us, he made life absolu
tely horrible for the fa
mily. So Œ so th-that 
is the situation now, we are 
Œ we have very little food. We 
do have this oil that the 
villager brings from the village, and this wh
eat. Then my mother started exchanging 
sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called 
Tra c ha na s
. It™s a Œ a coarsely ground 
wheat mixed with milk that is Œ that Œ that 
is in a dry state and wh en you add some milk, 
it expands, and it™s a very nutritious food and very filling. So Œ so  this
 is what my mother 
started doing, exchanging sugar for Œ for 
Trachanas
 or corn meal. Then some of the 
villagers would give us some eggs from the 
chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. It 
was a very difficult situation and th ere™s wint
er approaching, it™s already winter. It is 
cold. And so then, my 
mother, wh-who is a very resour
ceful person, she decided that Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
65
that she is going to  barter clothing, our pers
onal clothes, for food. And so she became a 
peddler, and she went with my 13 year old 
brother from village to village, exchanging 
clothing for food. Or, she di
d other things. She knitted fo
r people. She was Œ she had 
many skills. She knew how to make lace. An-A
nd one Œ one thought came to her mind is 
that the girls in the village, th
ey want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to 
Œ to knit. I di Œ can teach them how to embr
oider, how to make lace, and so Œ and said, 
there are a lot of girls in the village who w
ould want this, and they  would exchange my 
services for food. And the one fa
mily that I mentioned earlier, the 
Tsulamitsu
(ph) 
family, they had seven daughters. They  had 
prepare seven dowries. So she went to Œ 
started with them. And she™d go there ever
y day and help them, show them how to 
embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exch ange for cheese or br
ead or whatever they 
had. So  they  ha Œ my  parents had to start 
rationing the food. It was less and less every 
day. And I Œ I rememb er it was winter, still w inter, and there were some mulberry trees 
and fig trees. There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in 
Greece
. An d  my  mo th er 
said, you know, when these, 
you know, these fig trees, wh
en spring and summer come, 
th-they™ll be full of figs. And so I remember 
this game very vividl
y, you know, walking 
underneath those trees, waiting for some
day to see figs up on the tree.  
Q: And that you rememb er as your own memo ry. 

A: That yes, I remember. In fact, at one 
point, it was in the 
summer when figs had 
formed, there was one fig tree that was growi
ng on Œ on the edge of 
a retaining wall, and

I reached to Œ to get a fig, and I fell off th
e retaining wall, and I Œ I remember th at, of 
course. I didn™t get hurt, but Œ 
Q: Must have been a little scary. 
A: It was, it was. It was scary, yes. But Œ 
Q: Do you reme mb er being hungry? 

A: Yes, I remember being h
ungry, and to th is day, I ca
nnot bear seeing people throw 
away food. You know for me food is some
thing very, very valu
able, and I™m very 
conscious Œ I™m very conscious of the waste 
that I see around me these days. But yes, 
hunger was pervasive. That™s all we could 
think of was in our em Œ our stomachs were 
empty, was Œ it was Œ we were very hungry . 
Q: Now, were people in the village also 
hungry, or they were
 less so than you? 
A: The villagers Œ well, you kn
ow, they Œ they had chickens
, so they  could get eggs. 
They  would slaughter a chicken here and ther
e to get meat. They ha
d goats for milk. But 
we had Œ didn™t have a
ny of these animals, an
d they had stored food
, as they always do, 
for the winter, like dry figs a
nd walnuts, especially. Lentils
 and beans, dry beans. So 
poverty and hunger were pervasive, but we we
re Œ we were worse off than they were, 
because we didn™t have these reso urces that th
ey were used to; the 
animals that provided 
them with nutritious food. 
Q: And Œ and your pa
rents didn™t have money either any mo re, an-and an yway, it was 
worthless.

A: The money was worthless, yes, yes. One 
wo nderful thing happen ed
 during this period 
of Œ of, literally, starvation. 
A group of partisans, or 
a nda rtes
, as th ey were known, they 
came to the village and they camped there, th
ey Œ they settled ther
e for 20 days. There 
were 60 of them. I don™t know why they settle
d in the village, but my
 parents recognized 
there was an opportunity for us
 to get food. And it was either my  father or brother who 
approached the captain of this band, and desc
ribed our desperate situation and asked them 
if they could help us. And the captain agreed  
to give us the equivalent of two portions of 
a Œ of food for one partisan, for 
the four of us to share. And so  my  brother, wh en the Œ th e 
bugle was sounded, he could go there with a 
pot, and th ey would give
 him the portion of 
Œ of a partisan, which was not very mu ch. It wa
s just corn soup and a 
piece of corn bread. 
But for us it was God sent. And he did that tw
ice a day, and we would share the food, and 

Œ and that was for 20 days. That was quite a Œ 
a long time. So that was the situation. I 
don™t know at what point my  parents Œ my  mo th
er decided that she sh
ould use Œ not Œ to 
sell not only our personal clothing, but also 
household items. I don™t know whether it was 
in that Œ in the wintertime or 
later on in the spring, but justall of a sudden she got this 
bright idea of Œ of using the cases 
Œ we had brought mattress cases. In 
Greece 
Œ in 
Greece 
you protect everything you have, like ma
ttress, you have to  have a case for the 
mattress, to protect it from dust. And so we 
Œ when we came to th
e village, we brought 
these matt r ess ca ses w ith us, and we stuffed 
them with hay to make
 mattre sses . So  my  
mother, out of desperation she had this brillia
nt idea, said, I have these mattress cases. I 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

68
can Œ I can use them to make pants for Œ fo
r boys, or men. These Œ the villagers are 
dressed in rags. And Œ but thes
e mattress cases, usually, they ha
ve very bright stripes, red 
stripes. So my father said, n
obody is going to wear these ri
diculous looking pants, with 
these bright stripes. And then 
he thought further and said well, we Œ we can dye them, we 
can dye them brown. And that was my  fathe
r™s great opportunity  to 
experiment and he Œ 
he said, we™ll gather shells of Œ walnut shells
, and they  were plentiful
 in the Œ in the Œ in 
the fields, and Œ and poppies. So  this mu st ha
ve happened in the spring, early spring, and 
there are lots of poppies in Œ growing in Œ in
 the mountains. So he 
made this concoction, 
boiled walnut shells with the poppies, crea
ting this brown gooey material, and dipped 
these mattress cases w h en they
 came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they 
turned brown. Later on I found ou
t that Œ that in colonial tim
es they used walnuts to dye 
wool and Œ and fabric. 
So Œ so my  mo ther ma de pants fo
r Œ for boys, and then she used 
sheets, the sheets that we brou
ght, to make shirts for me n. And so sh e had all these wares 
to exchange for food, 
then she went from villa
ge to village with my brother, doing that. 
And she™d come home with Œ w
ith cheese or bread or Œ ever
ything was delicious to us, 
anything was delicious. 
Q: And she did all of this by hand, because Œ 
A: Yes Œ 
Q: Œ of co urse, she had nothing else. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
69
A: Œ exactly. E-Everything by hand. It was Œ 
she™d work long hours 
and in the daytime. 
She had to do it in the daytim
e because one of the things we lost were candles, the 
candles that we brought. And so it was winte
r, the days were short. But again my father, 
he invented something, he experimented w
ith pieces of rubber from the tires, car tires, 
that the village cobbler was usi
ng to repair shoes. He would 
use the material fro m tires as 
soles for shoes. And so he collected scraps 
of rubber and burned th em. He Œ he mounted  
them with a Œ an old rusty can by the fireplace
 and Œ and it burned. It
 gave off light, but a 
horrible smell. The smell was ab
solutely horrible, but we had 
light at night. So  Œ so he Œ 
he Œ both of my  parents were very resourcef
ul people, and they would always find th e 
solution to Œ to
 a problem.  
Q: Do you think your mo ther wo
rked more than your
 father in some re
spects, t h at she Œ 
she had a harder time? 

A: Yes, definitely, she Œ she worked very
 hard . And my  father, he was Œ he had a 
sedentary job at the bank, so he wasn™t used
 to his long walks on rough terrain. So there 
were times he had to cross a creek, or a Œ a river 
[indecipherable] 
that was not Œ not a 
very deep river, but he Œ he came down  with 
aches on his legs, and th
en he had the dizzy 
spells. He had a few medical problems that 
had Œ had the Œ they we
re left unattended, 
although there were a couple of occasions 
when my mother and br
other, they walked a 
long distance to a village called 
Tatarna
 that had a hospital for 
the partisans, and there 
was a doctor there. They consulted with him,
 and the doctor gave them some me dicine

for my father, but somehow the villagers 
and us had managed to recover wh atev er 
ailments w e had, on our own.
 So that was the situation in
 the winter. It was a v ery 
desperate situation. Then wh
en spring came, there were Œ 
things were a little better 
because they gave us a short Œ a small plot 
to cultivate. And then 
there were mulberries. 
The mulberry trees plentiful, 
which caused Œ and we lived 
on mulberry berries for a 
number of days until we develo
ped stomach cramps and we r
ealized we had to stop that. 
But it was a very difficult period, and my  mo the
r, she bore the brunt of it, she really did. 
That is the reason why, throughout this peri
od she kept saying that I will go myself down 
to the city and bring a horse-l
oad of food. And Œ and there we
re groups of villagers that 
were going to the city. And she said, I™ll just jo
in one of them and go
 down into the city. 
And my  father and brother al
ways say no, no, absolutely 
not. And she would say why? 
The villagers go. And Œ and sh
e Œ they would say, yeah, but
 you™re not an ordinary 
villager, you Œ you™re Jewish. An
d she said, well, I have an 
I.D.
 card, because they Œ my 
parents had acquired 
I.D.
 cards issued by Œ by the German
s. The priests of the village 
provided them with baptismal papers and 
so the papers were given to the German 
authorities. Thenames hadŒ we
re changed. And there was a 
picture and my Œ both my 
parents had an 
I.D.
 card with their picture and signed 
by German officials. But the Œ the 
ironic thing is that in the 
I.D.
, they do not ask for religion. 
It™s rather bizarre. Perhaps 
they didn™t want to raise su
spicions that Œ because tha-th
at was one of the reasons why 
many Jews in the cities, such as 
Ioannina
 did not feel threatened, did not feel that they 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
71
should leave, they sh
ould go in to hiding, because the Ge
rmans were careful not to raise 
suspicions of what was awaiting them. And 
Œ and in fact, the letters that we were 
receiving from my relatives in 
Ioannina
 were Œ were, you know, why don™t you come to 
Ioannina
, we have plenty of fo od. Why should 
you be starving up th
ere? And the same 
letter from 
Evia nir
(ph) 
Papadapoulos
(ph), our Œ my father™s 
colle ague, you know, come 
to 
Ag rinion
, there is plenty of food. And there 
were many cases of Jews who returned. 
They had left the city and 
gone to the countr
yside to hide. And because nothing was 
happening in the cities, they 
returned, and they were eventu
ally arrested. But my Œ my 
father, my brother were Œ an-and
 my mother were determined 
to stay in the village. So Œ 
but she, every time sh e saw a group of villagers going down to 
Agrinion
, she would say, 
all I have to do is just join them
 and Œ and our situ
ation will improve. 
Q: So sh e became more optim
istic at a certain point? 
A: She just was so desperate that she was goi
ng to  defy  any danger that she was going to 
face. And eventually, in March,
 when the sn ow melted and th
e conditions for travel were 
a little better, she Œ she joined 
one of these groups, and went
 down, started a long trek 
towards the city of 
Agrinion
. Sh e walked fo r 12 hours, a
nd on homemade shoes because 
her Œ she had a pair of shoes that was thread
bare, and then the other pair were Œ had high 
heels. You can see how Œ how unp
repared we were for this kind
 of life, she brought shoes 
with high heels to 
Psilovrahos
. And so  she Œ she went with 
Œ with a group of villagers 
down  to 
Agrinio n
. This is very rough terrain, and a
ll on foot. Sh e walk
ed for 12 hours, 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

72
until she reached a village very close to 
Ag rinio n
. I believe it was called 
Frangokisa
(ph). 
Frangokisa
(ph). And sh e had given Œ ther
e was a young man, boy, who 
Œ to whom my  mo ther had given a slice of 
bread. She had Œ she brought two slices of 
bread, one for herself Œ well, for herself, both of them, but she was so tired, she asked 
him, would you let me ride the mu le if I ga
ve you a slice of brea
d? And Œ and he did. 
And while they were doing this transaction,
 all of a sudden she hears her name, you 
know, Mrs. 
Matsas
, Mrs. 
Matsas
. And that was Œ it turned out it was a friend of ours that 
they knew from 
Arta
, and her husband was the math teacher of my  brother. Wh at a 
coincidence, in this wilderness. And her name was 
Zvolise
(ph). And she said, Mrs.
 
Matsas
, wh ere are you going, why are you here, where you should be far away from 
here. And went on to say, ha
ven™t you heard, haven™t you 
heard wh at happened to your 
people? And then sh e went on to
 say, you know, the Jews of 
Arta
 and 
Preveza
 and 
Ioannina
 have all been arrested. The Jews of 
Arta
 and 
Preveza
 are now housed in the 
Papa petrou
 tobacco warehouses and I don™t kn
ow where they took the Jews of 
Ioannina
. And this is the first time 
that my mother learns of th
e fate of our relatives. It 
was a very Œ a very painful, unbelievable ne
ws that she heard, it was Œ she was totally 
devastated, crushed. 
Q: Let™s stop the tape. 
End of Tape Five 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

Beginn ing Tape Six 
Q: Okay , you Œ you wanted to go 
back to the hospital in Œ in 
Ta rta rna
, is that Œ 
A: 
Tartarna
, 
Ta rta r na
. 
Q: 
T-Tartarna
. 
A: That was a very affluent village, and it had 
this hospital for the 
partisans and then the 
villagers. One of the Œ the doc
tors there at one point was 
Thanos
(ph) 
Papath eodoro
(ph), 
a very fine man, whose family 
also lived in the vicinity. And 
a Œ it™s just a si Œ it was a Œ 
quite a coincidence, my  mo ther and brother 
met them, met the family and the doctor and 
there were three daughters, 
Hera
, 
Ephemia
(ph) and 
Irini
(ph), or 
Nini
(ph). And the 
middle one, 
Ephemia
(ph) became my best friend after th
e war. We™re friends to this day. 
And there were Œ they were Œ played a ve
ry important role in the family, in my 
development. They were a very cultured fa
mily, and it was through them that I was 
exposed to classical music a
nd paintings. Her father was 
an amateur painter. A very 
refined person. And Œ and this is the hospita
l where my  f Œ my  brother was asked by the 
docto r Œ I don™t know whether it was Dr. 
Papath eodoro
(ph) or Dr. 
Panopoulous
(ph), 
the earlier doctor, asked my father to 
sing the ma Œ I™m sorry, my brother
 My ka s
(ph), he 
was known as 
Mykas
(ph) partisan songs. And my  Œ my  
f Œ brother loved those partisan 
songs, they were in the air, everywhere. 
They were very idealistic, describing a 
wonderful society that is goi
ng to be built after the war, 
a society that was free of 
ignorance and poverty and inju s
tice. And all of these wonderfu
l ideas appealed to him as 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
74
a young person. And so 
he Œ he learned all those wonderfu
l songs. He sings them to this 
day. I Œ I learned a few of them, but he was the one wh o Œ who sang them, and he had a 
beautiful voice, he still does. 
So now I will come back to th
e Œ to this encounter of my 
mother with Mrs. 
Volis
(ph). So Mrs. 
Volis
(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as 
possible. Sh e talked to her husband, Mr. 
Volis
(ph), and he suggested that Œ n-now my  
mother actually, even at this point
, she said Œ she insisted that she go into the city, in spite 
of all this. She said, we™re starving, we Œ we
 have to get some f
ood. And so her husband 
recommended that she go to another village called 
Kamaroúla
, where he has a 
kombarro
(ph). 
Kombarro
(ph) is a godfather. And his name was 
Christos 
Za mbarros
(ph), and he Œ he was a t
eacher, and he said, he will 
help you. So 
my mother 
started walking alone with this horrible know
ledge of Œ of wh at had happened  to our 
people, to 
Kamaro úla
. Sh e recognizes the house wh ere this man lived, knocks on the 

door several time, they do not an swer. Even tu
ally they open
 the door very cautiously , 
they let her in very quickly, 
and she Œ she told  them who she was and who Œ who sent her 
to them, and she said, I™m looking for 
Christos Za mbarros
(ph). These were the sisters 
of 
Christos
, and they said Œ they were Œ they 
were frightened because the Germans has 
searched their house mo ments before my  mo th
er arrived. They  took her to the window 
and they said Œ pointed to th
e Œ to the square and said, lo
ok down there. You see, the 
Germans are still there 
and they™re still search ing for peop
le there. They were searching 
for partisans, because at this point the Œ th
e resistance had grown 
very strong and they 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
75
were sabotaging the German advance a
nd German actions; blowing bridges and 
destroying roads. And so they sa
id, take this ker Œ they gave
 her a kerchief quickly, said 
put it on, and ju st pretend that you are our aunt from 
Psilovrahos
. Don™t say anything. 
They  sent for their brother and he came, and 
my  mo ther explained to him wh at was ha Œ 
what happened, and begged him to Œ to go 
Œ I think Œ I think wh
at happened Œ I don™t 
know Œ I™m not so sure at this point whether 
she had to go to thei
r country home where a 
deaf mu te aunt was guarding their store Œ 
the food supplies. I don™t know wh ere this 
meeting with 
Christos Za mbarros
(ph) took place, but he 
was very, very nice, and 
understood the situation,
 and he said, don™t worry. I will godown to Œ into the city, and I 
will do my best to bring a hors
e-load of Œ of food. So in 
the meantime, my mother was 
waiting in this country home with 
this deaf mute aunt. This Œ 
Ka ma roúla
 was very close 
to 
Ag rinion
. And a few hours later he returned, bu
t without a horse-load of food, and 
explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not 
allow any food to leave the c
ity. And they  had Œ they  had executed  resistance fighters 
already in the city, about 200 of
 them. So the situation had really become very hard, very 
tough. And they said, 
the only thing th at I was able to bring from your friends, your 
neighbors, were tea, a bottle Œ 
a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. V ery useful 
things, but not what we expect
ed . So  Œ  so  my mo th er to ok  
this me Œ these few items and 
started walking back to our city Œ to th
e village. And at one point she Œ she met 
Pepo la
(ph) 
Ha nna h
(ph). He was a re Œ a Jew ish resi
stan ce fighter, a
nd he already knew 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
76
what had happened. So  they fell into each ot
her™s arms  and they  cried and it was a very, 
very emotional experience for my mother. Bu
t she had to rush Œ I 
should tell you that 
there were a lot of Jewish young men that ha
d joined the resistance
 up in the mountains. 
They have left their Œ their families toŒ to save themselves, and they joined the 
resistance. Unfortunately, a number of them
, they joined
 the resistan ce, the Œ the 
andartes
, but then they were afraid of repris
als by the Germans against their families, 
and so th ey returned. But a numb
er of them stayed in the m
ountains. So they had to rush  
to Œ 
Christo s
(ph) and my  mo ther Œ th-the partisan
s did not allow anybody to walk after 
sundown, and it was close to su
ndown. So they climbed a hill,
 and at the top of the hill 
was a little chapel, a 
little church that 
Christos™
 grandfather had built.
 And so they spent 
the night there, and this was Saint
 Elias
 chapel. And then the next
 day they said goodbye, 
and there is my  mo ther bearing this horribl
e news, alone, walking alone from this place, 
Kamaro úla
, all the way to 
Psilovrahos
, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time. 
So when she came back, 
at that point my brother, my f 
Œ and my father were outdoors 
working on this plot of land that they gave
 us to cultivate, a
nd when they saw her 
coming, she was walking very slowly, they  st
arted to laugh, and th ey said, didn™t we tell 
you not to go? You came back
 Œ she came back three days
 later and she Œ she was 
planning to stay for seven or eight days in 
Ag rinion
. We told you not to go. And my  
mo ther was in terrible physical shape, b
earing the horrible news and she said, don™t 
laugh. Come in the house and when I tell 
you what happened, you will cry with bitter

77
tears. And so she told us, and we were Œ we
 were just devastated. And I remember this 
scene. I had never, ever seen my
 mother in that state. H er eyes were Œ her Œ her feet were 
swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were
 red, and she was physically exhausted and 
emotionally just absolutely drai
ned. So we were just Œ just 
Œ just shocked. It took us Œ 
took a long time for Œ to recover 
from this shock, and th e only thing th at sort of brought a 

ray of hope that sustained us was the 
possibility that they were taken to 
Kraków
, 
Poland
, 
because that was the rumors
 that circulated when th
ey deported the Jews of 
Sa lonika
, 
that they were being relocated to Œ to 
Kraków
 to establish their own Jewish community, 
to be self-govern ed with their own mayor, to 
establish synagogues wh
erever th ey wanted. 
So we thought that th Œ 
these Jews as well, from 
Ioannina
, 
Arta
 and 
Preveza
, that that 
was their destination. And you know, my  pare
nts said, we have to 
do something, but Œ 
but what can we do in Œ we™re
 in this remote village, what
 can we do? But my father 
knew that there was a continge
nt of the British mission in 
Greece
 in a nearby village, 
because the British, th
roughout the war, were there help
ing the war effort behind the 
scenes. Hel p ing the resistance. The British were
 there helping the re
sistance, ev en though 
later on, after the war, the British were in strumental in preventing communism from 

becoming established in 
Greece
. But we Œ my father knew of this British mission, and he 
said we Œ we Œ we have to contact them. 
We should write letters and we should send a 
letter to the Œ he said, the nations of the worl
d have to know wh at™s happening, they have 
to do something to stop it. We didn™t rea
lly know what was Œ you know, anything about 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

78
the Final So lution or what diabolic plans of 
the Nazis were at this p o int. So Œ so  my 
father decided to write a letter addressed to
 the British government. And the letter, that 
was going to  be delivered to my  
aunt and uncle, who resided in 
Alexandria
 in 
Egypt
, 
and they  in turn would give 
the letter to the Greek govern
ment in exile, which was in 
Egypt
. It all sounds so naïve now, but at th
e time it was a way of doing so mething. And 
so sure enough, my fa
ther composed these letters and Œ 
and my  mo th er and brother again, 
were to deliver these le
tters to the village of 
Priantza
. They didn™t know where 
Priantza
 
was, they had to Œ to  ask many people to find their way to 
Priantza
. So they finally 
arrive in 
Priantza
 and the Œ the British officials are w
illing to meet with them. And my 
mother, when she came back, sh
e described th at they Œ they
 walked into a large room, 
and they sat on two chairs, my brother and 
Œ and her, and facing these British officers, 
and they  told  them what had happened, and 
they Œ they begged them to deliver these 
letters. And the British officers, they accepted
 the letters, but they didn™t sound very 
reassuring. In fact, one of them said to my 
mother, you know Œ and I don™t know if it was 
his wife and children or Œ or some other rela
tive, they Œ you know, 
my wife and children 
died in th e bombing in
 London
, and Œ and that Œ I have to bear that loss. So my mo ther 
was in tears because she felt they were not 
giving her any encour
aging words. And so 
they left with my brother and felt that this
 was a fruitless mission.
 I don™t know whether 
these letters were ever de-delivered to Œ to
 anybody. But one Œ one 
good thing that they 
discovered while in 
Priantza
, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were Œ th-they

were delivering supplies to the British officers
 in the British mission, and Œ and so the 
villagers in 
Priantza
 had a lot of this material. So much
 of it they didn™t know what to do 
with it. And so wh en my  mo ther discovered 
that this material was p lentiful, she went 
from house to house asking for some of this
 parachutematerial, it
™s like a dark, khaki 
kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the pa
rachutes. And so when 
they return
ed  ho me 
after their mission, my brother came into
 the hou Œ room with this big bundle of 
parachute material. And th at was like gold for us
, because my  mo ther finally had fabric to  
sew dresses, blouses, and so  on. Bu t I Œ from 
what I recall, we did not dwell on this. Th-
There weren™t many discussions about this betw
een my  parents, about the deportation of 
the Jews. And Œ and th-the hope that we ma
intained throughout the war was that they 
were relocated to 
Poland
, and when the war is over, they will return. We were Œ my 

parents were primarily concerne
d with my grandparen
ts, because they were in their late 
years, and they were very concerned about th
em, if they would be 
Œ they™ll be able to 
survive. So then Œ so  my mo
ther started working again, 
sewing the dresses and blouses 
and resuming her bartering activ
ities with my brother, from v
illage to village. And that 
really was very, very  helpfu l, because now 
it™s summe rtime, the villagers have mo re food 

to exchange for Œ for dresses, 
an d so the situation, the food
 situation improved with th e Œ 
with the weather, you k
now, spring and summer.

Q: Let me ask you something, 
because was interesting, caus
e I Œ I can™t figure this out. 
When  you talked about your mo ther coming ba
ck and talking about your relatives, you 
yourself got really upset. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And I was trying to figure out whether yo
u were upset because your mo ther was so 

distraught, because I-I didn™t know whet
her you knew these re
la Œ whether you 
understood how bad the situati
on was, or whether you were shocked by your own mo th er, 
and still are shocked by that. 

A: Yes, it is Œ it™s really hard  to distingui
sh, because I did have a recollection of my  

grandmother, as I said  earlier, andall these cousins sitting on this Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ long table, my  grandmother serving rice pudding, 
rizogalo
. And Œ and Œ and so  i-it Œ 
this is very hard to distingu
ish, why I-I was very upset. Of course now, in retrospect, I 
was upset by the loss, the enormous loss that 
we Œ we suffered. But at that point, it was 
my mother, because my 
mother was, for me, a security bl
anket. And to see her in that 
state, it was very upsetting. Sh e was physic
ally, and of course emotionally, a rag. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: It was Œ it was a very difficult moment. 
Q: But there really was no knowl
edge of the deportations from 
Salonika
, or you knew 
the deportations which Œ but the rumo
r was that they were relocated to 
Kraków
.

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Not th at they were sent to 
Auschwitz
. 
A: Right, exactly. When my fa
ther first learned about the 
deportations of the Jews of
 
Salo nika
, which started I believe, in Œ in March of 1942 Œ was 40 Œ 
Q: Or maybe earlier? 

A: Œ 40 Œ no, it was ™42. 

Q: Was it ™42? 
A: I believe it was ™42. He Œ was in April, he
 asked Œ th is was the time when he asked Œ 
went to the Œ the manager of the bank a
nd asked for a leave absence Œ he had the 
permission to use his leave of absence any ti
me it became necessary. 
And my father told 
us later on the Œ the manager told  him, you 
don™t really have to 
worry about anything, 
you are different. In other words, the Jews of 
Salonika
 are more Jewish than you are. 
And Œ and it Œ and it was true that the Jews of 
Salonika
, they spoke 
Ladino
 and they 
spoke French, but they did no
t have good grasp of the Greek language, because it was a 
very large community, 
with many educational institutions
, and they could live isolated 
from the Greek Christian popula
tion. They  were not assimila
ted the way the Jews are in 
other cities, who Œ who are known as the 
Romaniote
 Jews, who spoke grew Œ Greek 
fluently, and could blend in  w
ith th e Greek population very easily and ju st disappear. So  
there was that perception that those Œ you ar
e different from those Jews. The fact of the 
matter is th at Œ

Q: It didn™t matter to the Nazis, did it? 
A: Didn™t matter to the Nazis, rig h t. 
This was Œ this Œ the Œ the Jews of 
Salo nika
 were 
descendants of the Jews that had come in 1492, expelled from 
Spain
 and th ey Œ they 
retained their language, while the Jews 
in the rest of there were known as 
Romaniote
. 
They had settled there, someof them even before the Ro
mans. And others came later on 
and they  Œ they spoke Greek fluently, and Œ 

Q: Did th e Œ do you think that that fact 
made it easier for you an
d your parents, your 
family to surviv e, because you co
uld blend in wh erever you were? 

A: Yes, yes, wherever we were. For example, the Jews of
 Athens
, who were not seph Œ 
they Œ th ey were not Sephard
im, strictly speaking, they 
were Œ they spoke Greek. A 
number of them hid in the city, and circulated 
in the city, and they c
ould blend in with the 

population, but the Jews of 
Sa lonika
 had this added problem 
that hindered their Œ 
Q: Well, let me ask you something. The resist
ance movement mu st have known wh at was 
going on. But that Œ but whatever
 they knew did not get filtered 
to your family, or to the 
population, is Œ is that co
rrect? Or did they not know 
[indecipherable]
 
A: What did they know about th
e di Œ I don™t know if they 
knew about the Final Solution. 
I know in Œ years later I Œ I knew Œ I le
arned that the British 
government and the 
American govern ment knew as early as Nove
mb er 1942, of the Final Solution. But 
unfortunately Œ a-and Œ and Œ 
did not do anything to inform
 the Jew s of what awaited 
them. And that is the very pain
ful thought that Œ th
at whatever was known  by the author Œ

American, British authorities was not disseminate
d on time for the Jews
 to Œ so survive, 
particularly the Jews of 
Greece
, and particularly these Jews that
 were arrested sort of late 
in the war. The arrests began for the 
Ro ma nio t e
 Jews in 1944, March 1944, and the war 
ended in
 Greece
, October 1944. 
Q: Right. 
A: There was plenty of time fo
r the Jews to be informed of
 wh at awaited them, and Œ and 
also 
Greece 
lended itself to Œ to the survival of the 
Jewish Œ first of all, there w as a very 
strong resistance group, very well organized, 
in the countryside. 
The countryside was 
free, it was called Œ it was free 
Greece
. Well organized, and then
, they operated within 
the cities. S o , when we left 
Agrinion
, it was October 1943, begi
nning of October, it was 
easy for anybody to  go in and out of the city
. It was October eighth, a few days after we 
left, when the Greek press published orders 
prohibiting th e Jews from leaving their place 

of residence. And if they were in another lo
cation, they were require
d to return to their 
place of residence. So, it was as late as th
e beginning of October, 1943, when you could 
move easily into the countryside.

Beginn ing Tape Seven 
Q: D-Do  you rememb er going to the baths of krem Œ 
A: 
Kremasta
. 
Q: 
Kremasta
. 
A: Yes, yes, I rememb er that very vividly, yes. 

Q: Why did you go? You went with
 your mother, is that correct? 
A: Yes, yes, the main reason I went Œ well, fi
rst of all I Œ  I was always very anxious to 
accompany my mother on thesemany expeditions that shewent with my brother. 

Q: Cause you really didn™t like being without her. 

A: I didn™t like to be Œ she was a pillar of 
strength for me, and I Œ I felt lonely Œ oh, my 
father tried to entertain me and keep me busy,
 but I Œ I Œ and Œ and 
of course, for me it 
was a mystery, all these villages, you know
. Cause they would come back with many 
stories to tell about oh, how a sheep was slau ghtered, you know, because the village Œ it 

was done, and it was a big even t, and th e d
ogs were barking. There were a lot of 
adventures that my  brother and mo ther had on
 these expeditions. And so  I felt it was just 
Œ when my mother 
suggested that, I Œ I was thrilled. I had some sort of a rash between 
my fingers, and Œ and my mother was really 
exhausted from her travels in the villages, 
and so sh e needed to recuperate somehow. So
 Œ and I was very thin, a-and the villagers 
had this belief that the spa 
can cure anything, anything y
ou had, whether it was a skin 
problem or orthopedic problem, whatev
er you had. The place to go was in 
Kremasta
. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

And so my  mo ther one day, it was August,
 it was summe r, she to
ld me, you™re coming 
with me and it will be a nice place, we™ll be 
by the river. And so we walked Œ we re Œ you 
walked to every place, you didn
™t take a mule or anything lik
e this, it wasn™t very far. 
And we went to 
Kremasta
, and this place was just teemi
ng with people. There were a lot 
of partisans, ardat Œ 
andartes
, recuperating 
andartes
. Many of them were injured, and 
they were recuperating there. There were villa
gers that had orthopedic problems, and they 
would Œ would Œ would come to 
Kremasta
 for the baths. The baths were supposed to 
cure everything. And my mother st Œ I re
me mb er her saying how people would come 
curled up in a basket on a mu
le, take the bath s and th en they would walk straight, you 
know, without the assistance of a cane or anyt
hing. I mean, there were
 miraculous cures. 
So we Œ we shared a room with another wo
man and her child, and we started going in to 
these baths, they were constructed of cement, 
and they would get fille
d up with this water 
that was Œ smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs
. And my mother kept saying, well this is 
very good, you know. I couldn™t 
bear the smell Œ this is Œ this
 is very good for you. And 
th-the following day my fa Œ my brother jo
ined us, and it was a sort of a nice, little 
vacation. But unfortunately came
 to an abrupt e
nd when the captain 
of the unit of the 
partisans that were stationed in 
Kremasta
 announced that th-the Œ first of all, the 
partisans had to go back to 
their units, wherever 
they belonged, and th
e villa Œ villagers 
had to go back home 
because the Germans were advanci
ng towards that area. S o , people 
panicked , they immediately stopped their bath
s and th ey started just a huge group of 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
86
people, some on canes or sticks Œ not canes, 
but sticks, or Œ or mu les and horses, going 
back to their homes. And so  when we reached
 the village with my
 mother and brother, 
the village was in a state of excitement, beca
use this time all of the villagers were going 
to leave the village. They Œ wi
th their animals, because the 
Œ at this point the Germans 
had become very aggressive 
towards the villagers, who at 
the beginning they were trying 
to appease, but now the villagers were supp
orting the resistance by providing them with 
shelter and food and so these Œ th-the German
s were carrying out retaliations against the 
villagers by executing them, or burning th
e villages. So that was known, and so 
everybody was leaving the village
 with their animals. A nd my
 father was in the process 
of baking bread in the Œ  
Q: In the oven. 
A: Œ his famous homemade oven. And there wa
s no time for the bread to Œ to Œ to bake 

completely. This reminds 
me of the exodus from 
Egypt
, with 
Mo ses
. And Œ and now we, 
again we pack as many things as we possibl
y could. And this time we don™t have any 
mules to transport things, so we have to trav
el light, with one blanket and very  few food 
supplies. And so  everybody is leaving the vi
llage, and this time we go to  another Œ a 
place much higher than the earlier place of 
Chia ndafelis
. This place is called 
Kamaria
. 
And so the entire village, with 
their animals, they 
camp this plateau at the top of the 
mountain, which offered a very 
good vantage point view of 
the villages below, not only 
Psilovrahos
 but the other surrounding villages. And so th ere we are, it™s August, the sun

is burning, there™s no Œ they Œ we Œ we had 
brought the canteen, a small canteen full of 
water, but it was very quickly exhausted. Th
e villagers knew of a Œ a spring, which my 
brother used to fill up the canteen again, bu
t still not enough water. 
The villagers, because 
they knew the terrain very well,
 and they were used to this 
rough terrain, they were able 
to discover other sources of water, but Œ but 
not us. So my father actually had to Œ to go 
from villager to villager begging for a little 
b it of water to fill the canteen. And I 
remember we were allowed only three gulps 
of water, you know, no more, because it had 
to last. The other problem was that we didn
™t have Œ we brought 
only one blan ket and it 
was very co ld at night up at the top of th
e mountain, so my  father borrowed a blanket 
from one of the villagers. And we
 decided Œ my parents decide
d that it would be best if 
we didn™t stay with the rest 
of the villagers, but went to a secluded place, so in case the 
Germans came to 
Kamaria
, they wouldn™t find us. So agai
n we were separated, we were 
separated from the rest of the villagers, and 
we found a secluded place and my mother or 
father or 
My ka s
(ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we
 milked it. So we had a little bit of 
milk. And so  we Œ we stayed in this place.
 Now, my mother was 
in Œ she was sick, she 
had fever, she was in very, very bad sh
ape, because she had gone to Œ to 
Kremasta
 to 
recuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of 
a sudden, she has to go up to the mountains 
again. And I Œ I reme mber this Œ my  brother 
doesn ™t remember this, but my Œ but I do Œ 
my mother saying, if the Germans come here, 
Mykas
(ph) will take 
Ninetta
, climb a rock 
and then a tree. And Father
 should hide somewhere, 
and I will throw all of our

88
belongings off this Œ on the Œ 
off the precipice and I will get all Œ you know, fall off the 
precipice as well, not to leave a trace of our
 presence there. And for me, you know my  

mother, who was a pillar of strength, to say su
ch thing was a very Œ a very shaky Œ shook 
me up. And probably  that™s the reason why 
I remember it. So we Œ from Œ from this 
location, we were able to see fires being se
t on the villages below. And it was, you know, 

one village after the other being set on fire
, systematically. And they had reached our 
village, 
Psilovrahos
, and th ey began to burn  those hou ses as well. And Œ and it was Œ it 
was horrible, because these people were very
 poor to begin with, 
and now they™re losing 
Œ to lose their house and th eir household, it 
Œ it was awful. But then , sudden ly, the fire 
stopped Œ the sa Œ fires in 
Psilovrahos
. They had burned a few houses, but then the Œ the 
f Œ the fire stopped. And we 
didn™t know what had happened, but later on Œ in fact, on my  
last visit to 
Psilovrahos
 in 2005, some of the villagers 
told me what had happened. One 
of the villagers, his name was 
Bulumbashez
(ph), a-an old, elderly person, became so 
infuriated with what was ha
ppening, that he defied th
e danger and he started coming 
down the m Œ the mountain w
ith his cane and he had bi
noculars, creating a lot of 
commotion as the rocks were tu
mbling down, and the two Germ
ans with the torches that 
were setting the houses on fi
re, they thought that the 
andartes
 were coming down. An-
And so they stopped and left. 
And Œ and so this man really saved the village from Œ from 
being burned to the ground. So
 it Œ there™s so many things that I learned afterwards, and 
at the time Œ

89
Q: You didn™t know, right. 
A: Œ they  were happening, but 
we didn™t know what was ha
ppening. For example, that 
explosion that we heard the first time that 
we had to leave the village at Œ at Œ that 
explosion, we have an e
xplanation now. We learned af-afterwards that the 
andartes
 in 
Agio s Vlassis
 where they were suppose
d to stop the advance of the Germans, recognized 
they didn™t have enough forc
es and so they  set the ammu nition depot on fire, and so they  
ex Œ that was the source of the explosion. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: But at the time, you hear sounds, we
 don™t where Œ what the cause of it. 
Q: Did your hand get better from 
even your brief 
time at the Œ 
A: Yes, yes Œ 

Q: They did get better. 

A: Œ yes. And my mother suffered of an ear 
infection, and that also got better. I mean, 
there™s no doubt that these waters 
had Œ and Œ and mud had medicinal Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ factors, but Œ 

Q: Do you reme mb er ha
ving lice in your hair? 
A: Oh, yes. Do I remember that? That was a 
nightmare. That is a story in itself. The 
blanket that my father borrowe
d from one of the villagers in 
Kamaria
 was infested with 
lice. And so when the German
s retreated and the whole villa
ge returned, we came back, 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

90
and suddenly our clothes, our hair was infested
 with lice. It was a horrible situation, and 
there were no medicines, of course, to Œ and in
secticides. So Œ and th
at again, I remember 

as a firsthand experience, how we went to a 
remo te location. My  parents had to borro w a 
large kettle and Œ and we
 had so ap, so my parents, they 
washed all the clothes with soap, 
and then  Œ and blankets
, and everything, all of our posse
ssions, and then th ey boiled th em 
in water. They lit fire under this kettle and th
ey boiled them to Œ to kill the lice. And we 
had to dry our clothes and fo rtunately it wa
s August, so it was eas
y to dry them. We 
washed ev erything that we possessed. But unf
ortunately, I Œ I had the very thick, curly 
hair, and they Œ the lice were settled there Œ 

Q: Comfortably. 
A: Œ comfortably. An d my  mo ther Œ one way to 
Œ to control the lice is
 to crush the insect 
between your thumbnails and also crush the ve
ry tiny eggs that they lay on your hair 
strands. But it was impossible, and I had to sc
ratch like mad. And then my mother said 
one day, wh at if I cut off this side of your
 hair? And I said yes. We didn™t have mirrors, 
so I didn™t know what I looked
 like. And it felt much better, so
 I said, let me cu t the other 
side as well. So that felt better. Little by little
 she cut off all of my
 hair totally, totally. 
Q: And this you rememb er? 
A: This I remember. A nd I remember that 
she put a hood on my  head so the children 
wouldn™t make fun of me. And 
the children, of course, you kn
ow, this is summer. They™d  
ask me Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

91
Q: Right. 
A: Œ why are you wearing a hood? And I said, I like hoods Œ and I don™t rememb er what I 

said, but I didn™t care what they said. I wa
s really Œ it was a great, great relief. I 
reme mb er this so vividly, yes. 

Q: So did Œ did it actually remove
 all the lice when she did that? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Because they weren™t resting on 
your scalp, they 
were ins Œ in Œ 
A: No, she was able to wa
sh my  scalp easily, and Œ 
Q: Uh-huh, right, wh ich she couldn™t do Œ 

A: Œ so Œ but it was the hair where they ha
d Œ I don™t know if you™re familiar with lice, 
but Œ 

Q: No, I™m not really familiar, no. 

A: Greeks who lived to the Œ w
ith the Œ the war period are ve
ry familiar with lice, it was 
pandemic, it was 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Well certainly when you talk to concentra
tion camp survivors, they talk about lice all 
the time. 

A: Of course, of course, of course. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Because that™s one of the Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: Well, that™s interesti
ng. So you were Œ oh Œ 

A: Yes, the Œ the Œ the villager, I don™t know
 whether it was the owner of the house or 
another villager, they gave my family a plot 
of land that had never 
been cultivated before, 
and it was full of rocks. It was a v ery, very 
rocky village. And so my
 father had to borrow 
garden ing tools to hoe and shovel. 

Q: This is after you come back? 
A: This is Œ this was done in th e sp
ring, so this is before going up to 
Kamaria
 Œ 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. 
A: Œ because we started cultivating this piece 
of land in the s Œ in the spring. And so  we 
had to ex tract the rocks and my  brother had to
 carry manure. That was another thing th at 
Œ the villagers were Œ were willing to share wh
atever they had, so 
they had to share the 
ma-manure from their animals an d my brother 
would carry it on her Œ his back. And then 
my  father didn™t know anything 
about garden ing, but he learne
d quickly; he had to learn 
quick ly. And so we made a garden, we plante
d onions and bean s, ma
ybe potatoes as well, 
I™m not sure. So we did Œ we did get so
me Œ some food from the garden, not mu ch. 
Q: But some. 
A: Yes. 
Q: I see. D o  you remember the Œ what Œ wh
at might be called liberation? I don™t know 
what you called it in 
Greece
, but there was an en
d in 1944, right?

A: Yes. 
Q: Earlier than in ot
her places, actually. 
A: Yes, yes, yes. The first news about lib
eration reached us in Œ in September. There 
were Œ 

Q: Of ™44? 

A: Of ™44. There was this Œ the news that 
th-the Germans were be
ing withdrawn Œ were Œ 
were with Œ withdraw ing from 
Greece
, because it didn™t happen overnight.  
Q: Right. 

A: But my  parents reaction was caution. They  di
d not want to Œ to re
turn right away, so 
they wanted to wait until we were cert
ain that the Germans had retreated from 
Agrinion
. 
Q: And did you notice? I m
ean, you were six now.  
A: Did I know th at? I don™t think I knew th at.I don™t think I Œ I was conscious of that at 

all, no, it™s Œ 

Q: Right, okay. So when 
did they become certain, 
so that you could leave? 
A: It was in October when the 
Germans had Œ news had reached 
Ag rinio n
 that the 
Germans had retreated, and there were pr
obably villagers th
at had gone into 
Agrinio n
 
and they witnessed that the Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ Germans indeed  had Œ had left the city. A
nd so  we didn™t all leave togeth er to return 

to the city. First it was my fa
ther and mother that returned
, because the house where we

lived before the war was no longer available 
because the owner o-occupied the house. 
And so there was a housing shortage. Ther
e was always a housing shortage in 
Agrinion
 
because the people preferred to grow tob
acco than build houses. There were always 
tobacco fields everywhere, and it 
Œ it was a very big industry for 
Agrinion
. After the war, 
the family next door, that was 
their livelihood, planting and 
selling tobacco. So I know all 
about the process of growing tobacco, from be
ginning to end, except for smoking, I never 

smoked. 
Q: So your parents went fi
rst to try to find a place. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And di-did Œ did 
Mike
 Œ 
Michael 
Œ your brother take care of you? Is that wa Œ 
A: Yes, 
Michael Œ Mike Œ Mykas
(ph) Œ 
Q: 
Myka s
(ph). 
A: Œ and I stayed back , and he was supposed 
to  be in ch arge of me and himself. And 
apparently  we mu st have eaten something that
 was stale or spoiled, and we both became 
ill; very, very ill. I-It w as Œ yo
u know, having survived the wa
r, here is a situation where 
we could have lost our lives, 
had our parents not return ed  on time to Œ to rescue us. 
Because I don™t think any of the neighbors knew 
of our situation. We Œ he Œ he Œ I don™t 
know wh at he cooked something that burned th
e pot, and then I don™t know what kind of 
food we ate, but we were very, very
 ill. But while my parents were in 
Ag rinion
, they 
really had a hard time finding a house. And my
 mother in her memoirs describes their

first night in Œ in the city. There were Œ we 
really did not look like 
city people any more. 
My father had a long beard a
nd he looked more like a par
tisan than a bank employee. 
And my mother was emaciated, and sh e was re
ally transformed. And they were in the 
main square, 
Letea
(ph)
 Belu
(ph) of 
Ag rinion
, and my  mo ther describes how a friend of 
ours approached them cautiously
, because they looked vaguely
 familiar, and as he got 
closer and closer, realized wh
o they were. And he was overj
oyed, because he was one of 
the 
Agrinion
 residents that witnessed the incarceration of the Jews of 
Preveza
 and 
Arta
 
in the warehouses of 
Papapetrou
. And he probably th ought that we also were among 
them. So he was overjoyed. It was like he sa
w people who were resu
rrected. And he ba Œ 
he asked them where do you plan to spend the 
night, and then he Œ he suggested that they 
spend the night in th e house of Mr. 
Za horopoulos
(ph), who was a bus driver, driving a 
bus from 
Ag rinion
 to 
Athens
. And he is the one who, wh en my  mother and my  brother 
were leaving the house to go to the 
Bokoro s 
house, he was on his wa
y to our house, and 
he encountered us on the str
eet. And he said, oh, so Mrs. 
Matsas
, I was just coming to 
your house to tell you th at the Jews of 
Athens 
have gone into hiding. See, he was Œ that 
was his route. He was just returning from 
Athens
 and wanted to in
form my family. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So this is where my parents 
spent their first 
night back in 
Ag rinion
, an d  my  mo th er 
describes how hospitable people were, and th ey 
Œ they  tried to do everything they could 
to make them feel comfortable. So they ha
d a hard time finding a house, but even tually

either Mrs. 
Huropoulos
(ph) or someone else suggested to
 my parents that they go to an 
agency  wh ich was run by Œ by 
[indecipherable]
 who were really at this point so rt of in 
contro l of the city and they sent my  parents 
to this house. And the house had two levels, 
we were going to occupy th e lower level, wi
th a very beautiful ga
rden, which we found 
out later that the Italians had constructed. 
And wh en th e landlady fo
und out that we were 
Jewish, she immediately went to this agen
cy  and said, why did 
you send me the Jews? 
And the young wo man there, the employee sa
id Œ said, close your mouth, and wh at 
difference does it make whether you™re Chris
tian or Jewish? They ™re people. And Œ and 
so she Œ she had to Œ to tolerate us. 
Q: Mm-hm. And that™s one of the stories that
 you were going to say about some people 
who Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ who were not necessarily helpful, right? 

A: Right. There™s Œ there were some people who were not very su pportive. 
Q: Right. I think we have to stop th e tape now.

Q: So, do your parents co-come with
in a couple of weeks or less to Œ 
A: No, it was a matter of days Œ 
Q: Days. 
A: Œ days, days, yes. 

Q: Okay . And th e two of you are sick in bed. 

A: Sick in bed, hardly able
 to speak, and th ey  quickly 
had to Œ you know, there was no 
medicine they could give us, 
and they didn™t even know 
what was wrong with  us, but 
they Œ th ey gave us some nouris
hment, which we lacked  for Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ many days. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we recovered after a while, and Œ 

Q: So th at was okay. 
A: Œ we were revived, yes. 
Q: And so, did you then  go to 
Agrinion
? 
A: Yes, then my  Œ I Œ I believe they 
sent my brother first, with Œ with 
Ba ba
(ph) 
Yoros
(ph) with a horse loa Œ load of food, beca
use by then we had Œ having sold all these 
little dresses made out of the parachute, my 
mother had collected a 
lot of wheat. Because 
she would sell dresses to people who didn™t 
have wheat, but with 
a promise that when 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

98
they harv est, they wo uld Œ she would be paid 
at harvest time. So now we have quite a bit 
of wheat to transport into the city. 
So Œ so  my  brother and Œ and this 
Baba
(ph) 
Yoros
(p h) 
and the mu le, or horse, I don™t know wh at it was, they come down into the city. I Œ I Œ 
I™m Œ I™m g lad that I Œ you asked me this 
question, because I didn™t say anything ab out 
Baba
(ph )  
Yoros
(ph). There was a time, after the first 
time that Œ which was in November 
Œ when we had to leave 
Psilovrahos
 and go to 
Chia ndafelis™
 house. There was another 
time when we had to leave the village. I do
n™t remember which month it was, but this 
time my father and 
Mykas
(ph) decided to leave the villa
ge, but my mother decided to 
stay, to guard whatever
 food we had. So my
 mother and I stayed 
in the house, and we 
were joined by the wife of Mr. 
Lavee
(ph), her name was 
[indecipherable]
, and she 
spoke German, and at one point she actually sp
oke with the Germans, 
and she claims that 
she protected the upper village of 
Psilovrahos
 from the Germans. I do
n™t know, this is a 
story that I™m not very clear on. Bu t Œ so my
 mother and I slept in
 the room, and then 
early next mo rning we hear a knock on th
e door. And we woke up, and there was 

Baba
(ph )  
Yoros
(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a 
retired policeman, and his son was a 
partisan. And 
Baba
(ph)
 Yo ro s
(ph) said to my mo
ther, what are you doing here with your 
child? If the Germans were to 
come to the village and Œ a
nd take you and your child, I 
will never, ever forgive myself. A nd so  when 
my mother heard that, she ha Œ didn™t have 
to hear anything mo re, she packed  quick ly a
nd Œ and Œ and she pack ed mo re than Œ than  
she could carry, and she Œ in her memo ir she 
says how sh e Œ she didn™t want to leave the 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
99
Œ the things that she packed, which was food 
and Œ and a blanket, but at the same time 
she realized that she couldn™t ca rry it. And at that point, Mrs. 
Tsulamitsu
(ph), this Œ the Œ 
the mother of this Œ of the seven daughter
s who my mother was tutoring and knitting and 
crocheting and making lace, she appeared with 
her mule, and Œ and she saw my mother in 
Œ in this Œ in distress, and sh e said, oh don™
t worry, I will carry all of your belongings. 
And so, with her, we reached th
e upper village, and Œ and so 
this is how we stand this 
time when the Œ the Germans Œ 
that was their second fo ray in
to our region, but this time 
they never reached th
e village, and Œ and so Œ and so 
we all returned. So this is 
Baba
(ph) 
Yoros
(ph) who play ed a significant part in Œ in ou
r story. As I said, th-the people really Œ 
they tried to Œ to help
 in any way they Œ th ey could, 
including th-the priest. You know, 
we Œ we used to go to the chur
ch, first of all to Œ not to sh
ow that we were any different 
than the other villagers, and al
so to eat some food there, 
because whenever there was a Œ 
a memorial service,
 they would serve 
koliva
, which is a mixture of boiled wh eat and 
pomegranates, cinnamon 
and su gar. It™s a very nutritious, 
delicious thing, but we™d go 
there and Œ and the relatives of the deceased 
would give everybody a handful of this and 
so there was another source of food fo r us
. And the priest, I don™t reme mb er his name. 
Papa 
Demetrius
(ph), perhaps. I don™t rememb er his na
me. He used to come to our house 
quite often, because he befri
ended my parents. And my mo
ther would always serve him 
coffee, which was a rare find, a ra Œ a re Œ a 
real treat for him. And he would chat with 
my father. I don™t know what 
they talked about, but we went
 to Œ attended ev en  Easter 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
100
services Œ Friday, Good Friday 
services. And this is the tim
e when Œ I learned later on, 
you know, after the war, I Œ I used to go to  the 
church with my friends a lot. And so as I 
said earlier, I knew a lot mo re about the Ch ris
tian religion than Œ than
 the Jewish religion. 
But on Fridays, when  
Jesus
 has been crucified and Œ an d 
he™s dead, and the priest is 
supposed  to exhort his flock to Œ to  move
 them, that this w
onderful human being 
sacrificed his Œ his life t-to save you. He™s 
Œ and so  he would Œ he 
Œ he Œ he would ha Œ 
he had to give a sermon to make people cry, 
especially the old wo men cry, and so he had 
to go on and on with  the crucifixion and th e 
pain that he suffered on the cross. And so 
Sunday they celebrated Easte
r, the resurrection, he came to
 our house and ap ologized to  
my  parents for having to give this kind of 
sermon in front of us. So i-it was, of course, 
appreciated by my  parents. He 
was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? I™m expected 
to do that, I™m expected to give this kind of
 sermon. So now, go back to my  brother and 
Baba
(ph )  
Yoros
(ph), they™re returnin
g to the villa Œ to 
Agrinion
. And so my  Œ my  
brother arrived with Œ with food, to 
Ag rinion
. And then, after a few days, my parents and 
I came down into the city. 

Q: What happened to  the food in  the bank? 

A: The food ca Œ we recovered 
the food in the bank, was Œ 
Q: You did? 

A: Yes, whatever food was Œ  

Q: So Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

101
A: Œ was available, stored, it was re
turned. Then they 
established Œ the 
EAM-ELAS 
established 
ETA
, which was an organization to distri
bute food, and they made my  father 
in charge of it, and my father 
was very, very  proud of this task because he felt he was part 
of the resistance, part of 
ELAS Œ EAM-ELAS
, yes. 
Q: So the war is over, but then 
a civil war begins, doesn™t it? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Does that begin almost right away? 
A: Almost right away, yes. 
Q: So you Œ you have a very
 long experience of w-war 
of various kinds, don™t you? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. And th e Œ the sad thing is 
that the Œ th-the country is polarized. It was 
polarized before the war, but now even more. And 
Ag rinio n
 was dominated by the Œ by 
the people that were members of 
EAM-ELAS
, and th eir personal friends that had joined  
the resistan ce, 
EAM-ELAS
. And there Œ there are trials that are taking place. It is an 
absolutely horrible situation. 
Th-T he people are drained fro
m the war experience with the 
Germans, and now they have 
to confront the civil war, where literally brothers are 
fighting each other. There were Œ there were pe
ople belonged to thesame family, and yet 
ideologically they were Œ 
Q: They were in different places. 
A: Different places, yes. 

Q: And that™s goes on fo r four years.

102
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: 1945 until 1949. 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: That™s a long time. 
A: Right. Long time. 

Q: So when it™s over, you™re 11. 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: And how is your life during th
at period? Is it Œ is it as 
difficult as it was during the w Œ 
I mean, now you™re older Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and you Œ you experience mo re in
 terms of your memory, I don™t Œ 
A: Right. Again, my life, my personal life as
 a child growing up was 
rather undisturbed. I 
Œ I was Œ you know, I was imbued with all thes
e ideas of social justice and freedom, that 
had been ab sorb ed. You know, 
I would hear this all around me
. People that admired, and 
had fo ught s Œ and Œ during the 
Œ the Œ you know, y Œ they had 
joined the resistance, they 
were my heroes. The people in 
EAM-ELAS
, they were the ones who saved us. So I-I had 
no Œ I Œ for me, those were the people I was Œ 
Q: You were rooting for them? 
A: I was rooting for them. The father of my
 friends, my best friends, who by the way, 
they lived across the 
street from us, Dr. 
Papethadoro
(ph) and the three daughters, they 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

103
lived across the street. I admired him and Œ a
nd I knew that his relatives and friends, they  
were Œ I knew the side they were with. So  
I just was sent to school, like Œ like all the 
other children, but I was Œ I was sent to the 
third elementary school, which served the Œ 
the children who lived in the outskirts of th
e city and the surround
ing villages. So my 
friends were these children who came from th
e surrounding villages, and by comparison, 
I was from a middle class family, 
and I was sort of a mo re sophisticated person. So I Œ I 
ha Œ I always had th e idea that my  family wa
s rich. We weren™t, at all. But because my 
friends and Œ and Œ and clas
smates were from the surroun
ding villages, who were 
impoverished. But my  association 
Œ a-and Œ and my  friends, Dr. 
Papethadoro™s
(ph) 
daughters went to the fourth  
elementary school, which served the city children. These 
were girls who celebrate Œ ha
d birthday parties. I had neve
r heard of a birthday party. 
Q: Right. 
A: But they had birthday parties and th ey i
nvited their friends, and 
they would have very 
good food, and they lived in th
e heart of the city. We lived 
in the outskirts. So there was 
this Œ so I remember this very vividly, of 
course, because I was already, you know, six, 
seven, eight, nine years old. And Œ but 
my association with the daughters of Dr. 
Papethadoro
(ph) was something th at en
riched my life a
nd opened worlds that I wasn™t 
aware of. They Œ they had a 
record player, I remember, a
nd th ey had a few records of 
classical music. And we would 
listen to the music, and we wo
uld make plays with Œ write 
the plays and produce them fo
r the neighborh ood children. And this Œ the Œ my  friend

Hera
, who Œ she™s going to  give a lecture in ju
st a few days on art, she would make all 
the costumes and the scenery. And Œ and my
 friend became eventually a professional 
actress, my  best friend. So it was a Œ a very
 rich and happy ch ildhood th at I had, th-
thanks to Œ to my assoc Œ my
 friendship with this family. 
Q: Did th ey open you up to things that even y
our family wasn™t doing, in some Œ in some 

ways? 

A: Such  as what? 
Q: Well, classical music Œ 
A: Yes, yes, oh yes Œ 

Q: Œ or art 
[indeciphera ble]
 because that was Œ 
A: Œ definitely. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah, yes, and Œ and I very vividly reme
mber a painting that their father Œ an oil 
painting that the father had done, and it was 
prominen tly displayed 
in their living room. 
But I became a part o f the family , they jo
kingly would say, oh, this is our fourth 
daughter. And they were 
just beautiful people. 
Q: Were your parents jealous of this, or no? 
A: No. 
Q: No, th ey Œ 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
105
A: Œ no, not at all, they were actually 
very grateful, because my  mo ther, when we 
returned to the city, she Œ well, a few days 
after we returned, a trickling of su rvivors 
become Œ began to pass through 
Ag rinion
, and among them cousins who had join ed the 
partisans. These are cousins that escaped in 
La risa
(ph) and th ey join ed the partisans and 
this is where they spent the war years. A
nd they were returning home not knowing what 
happened to their fami
lies. They had absolu tely no idea what had happened. So  my  
mother, after these cousins retu
rned, she decided to go to 
Ioannina
. And at this point, we 
don™t know what has happened to  them. This is
 early on. Cause we didn™t find out wh at 
happened until Œ see, this is 
October 1944. We didn™t find out
 the war ended in the spring 
of ™45, so we didn™t know what was happen
ing. So  my  mo ther decided to travel to 
Ioannina
, and this is a heartbreaking experience 
for her because she go
es into the homes 
of her sister s, 
Eftyhia
 and 
Annetta
(ph). Th-They had Œ they lived  in 
Ioannina
, they 
were married there, they had children. And 
these houses are occu
pied by villagers who 
had Œ whose villages had been 
devastated and they were co
ming into the city. They had 
been devastated because of
 the civil war. And there wa
s nothing wrong with them 
occupying those houses, but fo
r Œ for Œ for my mother Œ 
Q: It was hard. 
A: Œ it was really horrible. She was knocki
ng on th e doors and Œ an d they open ed the 
door and these strange faces were there, 
occupying her sisters™ 
homes. And my cousin
 
Sam
, he was one of the young men who es caped and jo ined the resistance Œ 
Sam

Meyer
(ph) was his name, he wa
s the son of my  Aunt 
Rezina
(ph). 
Rezina
(ph) was one of 
my father™s sisters. He kept
 on trying to  console my  mo th
er, saying, you have me, you 
have Œ Au nt 
Esther Œ Esthere
(ph), you have me now. I™ll take
 care of you; you have me. 
And he himself didn™t know wh ere his fami ly 
was, where his parents were. Yet for Œ for 
my mother it was an absolutely horrible, horrible time.
 Sowhen  she 
returned from 
Ioannina
, she wanted to occupy he
rself with whatever sh e co
uld. So mething that would 
take her out of the house. And so  she Œ oh, sh
e says in her me mo irs 
that while she was in 
Ioannina
, she met a merchant who was smuggling fabrics from 
Albania
. And she 
discovered that the person who was providing hi
m with the fabrics, was none else but her 
father. Her father, in 
Delvina
(ph), in al Œ 
Albania
 where he still had his fabric store 
because wa Œ he was still a me
rchant, because the Jews of 
Albania
, even though they 
went into hiding, they were ne
ver deported, and so  they all 
survived. And y Œ in fact, my 
grandparents never left the city of 
Delvina
(ph)
 
and the Germans occupied  their house 
because it was a nice house. So they were 
never Œ never disturbe
d by the Germans. And 
there were other European Jews that had come to 
Albania
 to survive, bu
t so Œ so the 
smuggler gave the idea that it™s possible to Œ to get fabrics from 
Albania
. And in fact, she 
got some fabrics from him and told
 him, when you go back to 
Albania
, have my  father 
pay you for the fabrics, becau
se we didn™t have any mo ney, either. My father had not 
been paid in cash yet. There was no cash to  be 
found, everything was ba
rtering. So this is 
how my  mo ther started beco ming a mercha
nt. And for her it was a lifesaving activity 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
107
because it brought her out of th
e house with Œ had to trans Œ 
transactions with the public. 
And I remember, she also smoked at that 
time, which was not common for women to 
smoke. It was sort of Œ people looked down on this. 
Q: Right. 
A: But it was her state, psychological state wa
s such that she probab
ly  experienced some 
relief smoking. So she found a shoemaker, not 
far from our house. And sh e noticed that 
there were some empty shelves there, and sh
e said, do you mind if I bring so me fabric 
here and I Œ I sell it to the customers? And sh
e said no, it™s okay. So this is where she 
started going into business, becomi ng a me
rchant. And of course for her, becoming Œ 
being a merchant was second natu re because sh
e had learned all of this in her father™s 
store in 
Albania
. This didn™t last very long becaus
e the owner of the shoemaker™s store, 
she was Œ became angry when she discovered th
at he Œ he was subletting the store to 
somebody else. And my  mo ther didn™t want to
 make a fuss, so she removed the fabrics 
and she opened a small store in another loca
tion. But she was very, very successful, 
because Œ because of the civil war, these 
village women were coming from the villages 
that were being devastated, into the city. And 
they were too shy to go to  a store run by a 
man. They were too shy to talk with a man 
and transact business w
ith Œ with Œ with a 
man, so they would flock to my mother, 
who was Œ then started dyeing less expensive 
fabrics. The fabrics that she brought from 
Albania
 were silk and really high class fabrics, 
which the villagers could not afford to buy. 
So she started buying less expensive fabrics 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
108
and she started traveling by herself, which wa
s quite daring for a woman at that time, to 
Patress
(ph) another city, to buy su pplies and sell 
them to the villagers
. So she was very, 
very successful. 
Q: So it was both a psycho
logical move, and Œ and Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ a financial move as well, but that wasn™t Œ 

A: Abso lutely. 
Q: Œ the major reason in the beginning. 
A: Yes, yes, but in talking with my moth er in later years, she told me how Œ how 

important it was for her to Œ to Œ to do th
is. And my  parents did 
not talk about Œ you 
know, throughout this period
, until Œ until the war ended in 
Euro pe
, we maintained hope 
that they were going to come back. We didn
™t know about the camp s of extermination, 

the Final Solution. All of this was totally u

A: Œ started trickling into the Œ int Œ in 
Greece

Œ just a handful of people, handful of relativ
es who Œ who came back, and they tried to 
piece their lives together. It was Œ it was a horrible time. 
Q: When  did you become conscious of wh at
 the Œ wh at was going on with these people, 
and what was going on in the wo rld? Ho
w Œ how old were yo
u, do you th ink? 
A: I-I think it was when Œ wh
en these concentration camp 
survivors returned, I became 
conscious of concentration camps, not through
 the people themselv es
, because they never 
talked about their experiences. They
 never talked. Even  my  cousin 
Nina
, who I saw in 
2005, I Œ I had seen her many, ma ny 
times before while I was living in 
Greece
, but never 
dared ask a question, until on my last visit, tw
o thou Œ in 2005, and th
at was the first time 
that she talked abou
t it to me. This is a whole lifetime Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ of silence. It was too ho
rrible for them to talk about. 

Q: Okay, let™s stop the tape and Œ

Beginn ing Tape Nine 
Q: You were talking 
about your cousin 
Nina
, who only  in 2005, be
gan to speak with you. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So, is your knowledge of
 the Holocaust not from pers
onal exper Œ not from what 
people have said to you? 
A: Exactly. Not from survivors, 
relatives or friends who had 
survived. It was from other 
sources, not from them. And wh en I was visiting 
Nina
, I remember she Œ I stayed with 
her f-for a number of days, and every morning sh
e would serve breakfast, and I wanted to 

ask her Œ and ev ery mo rning I™d say no, maybe she Œ she doesn™t want to talk about it. 

Until at one point, I don™t rememb er exactly how
 it came up, she said to me, you know, I 
was interviewed by 
Steven Spielberg™s 
project. And Œ and I said, you did? A-And Œ an d 
Œ and I Œ and this was the first time that I real
ized that she had talked about it. This is in 
Ioannina 
now, there used to be Œ there used to
 be two synagogues before the war. One 
was demolished and the adjacent school, the 
Alliance Israélite Universelle
 was torn 
down , and th ey used that spot Œ land to  bu
ild an apartment house for the Jews from 
Ioannina
 who surv ived either by going up in 
the mo untains, or concentration camp  
survivors. And they  live in
 that apartment house on 
Josef Elijia
 Street. And that is the 
name of Œ of a Greek Jewish poet from 
Ioannina
, th ey named the stre
et after him. But 
the Œ the horrible thing that I discovered on
 Œ after I made a tour of the Œ of the 
neighborhood where my  aunt Œ my
 cousin pointed out all the houses of our relatives. This 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
111
is where Aunt ri Œ
 Annetta
(ph) and Aunt 
Eftyhia
 lived, and wh ere my  grandparents 
lived. When I returned to 
the apartment house, I saw this graffiti written in an 
ungrammatical way, saying, you die at 17 an
d we bury you at 70. It was obviously an 
anti-Semitic graffiti on this build
ing that houses the remnants 
of that thriving community. 
This is a community that numbered 2,000 Œ 
almo st 2,000 Jews. An ancient community 
that had existed there for many, many centuries
. And there are th Œ a handful of people 
who live in this apartment hous
e with painful memories, and th
ey have to Œ to read this 
every day. So I asked her, wh
y don™t you Œ why don
™t you hire somebod
y to erase it? And 
said, we do it, and Œ and they come back, 
and they come back. I-It was Œ so my Œ my 
knowledge of concentration camps was not 
from our relatives th
at survived, yes. 
Q: Did your parents and Œ and 
Mykas
(ph) talk with Œ talk with
 you about wh
at happened 
when Œ and they said when you were a little girl this 
happened, and that happened? I 
mean, is th at where some of your memori
es come from? Or it 
is mainly from the 
memoirs that they wrote? 
A: They always talked  about our adventure 
in the mo untains, always. And they  didn™t put 
it down on paper until they were in the 
United States
 already. And it was really , as my 
father says in his memoirs, always the 
driving force behind us. Because by th en my  
brother had two daughters, and I had the daug
hter, and we realized 
that they had this 
treasure of information that should be reco
rded . And so we both, ma Œ my  brother 
Mykas
(ph) and I urged them to Œ to write down th eir memo irs. And I promised my  father

I was going to translate them, and I did. Bu
t my mother, I do reme
mber the st ories she 
came back with after her first visit of 
Ioannina
, wh en she went to visit her sisters™ house, 
Eftyhia
 and 
Annetta
(ph), they  were both married, and th ey had, each of them, two 
daughters. And they  Œ and she said that 
the neighbors Œ th ere was also a woman, 
Stavrypoulo
(ph) I believe, who occupied my aunts™ house at the time, and she was a 
mistress of one of the German officers 
who lived in my aunt™s house, Aunt 
Eftyhia™s 
house. And my  aunt 
Œ my  uncle Œ Aunt 
Eftyhia™s
 husband 
Na seem
(ph) 
Samwheel
(ph) 
was a dentist, and they were well-off, they ha
d a very pretty house, very comfortable. 
And so the German officer chose to Œ their 
Œ th at house to live in. And my  aunt would 
serve him meals every day. She was actually 
expecting a child, and yet she had to go up 
and down  to serve him. And my  mo ther 
learned this story when she came to 
Ioannina
 
that first visit after the war, that the Œ thisGerman officer asked my  aunt to bring mo re 
wine that na Œ particular night. And sh e 
said, tomorrow we don™
t know who lives and 
who dies. And so she brought more wine, it 
was a very sump tuous meal that she had 
prepared. And it was the very next day, March 21
st
 Œ 25
th
 Œ March 25
th
, when they 
rounded up the Jews of 
Ioannina  Œ 
of 
Ioannina
. They had to be awak
ened very early in 
the mo rning. It was an unusually cold day,
 it was actually snowing. And Œ and th ey 
knocked the door very early in the morni
ng, 5:30 in the morn
ing, people were still 
sleeping, and th ey told  them, you have, you 
know, 60 minutes to pack and assemb le in 
the sert Œ in a square 
by the Œ by the lake, 
Pamvotis
 Lake, of 
Io a nnina
. And this is what 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
113
they did, and Œ and so my a
unt Œ this is all totally unexpe
cted, because up until that point, 
things were relatively calm in the city, andso th is was an unsuspecting Jewish population 
that all of a sudden is rounded
 up. And so my  aunt approach
ed the Œ this German officer, 
and said, we too? You know, y
ou lived with us, and I served 
you so many meals, we too? 
He said, yes, you too. And my  uncle was still 
shaving, and it was a very Œ a horrible situa 

Œ a horrible scene that my moth
er described. And now in retr
ospect, when  I think Œ when  
I think of it, it™s very, very painful. Be
cause I can Œ I can just picture now my  
grandparents being awakened  early in the morning,
 in their later years 
in their lives; small 
children, pregnant women, they had to Œ to  
pack. What Œ what coul
d Œ they  didn™t know 
what to pack, what to
 bri Œ they didn™t know where th
ey  were going. And wh en I bring 
that scene in my  mind, I Œ I can™t Œ it™s so pa
inful, so painful. And then my  grandmother 

was a very kind person. She was Œ she ha
d many ch ildren and she was a self-trained 
midwife. And sh e was a Œ and Œ and my  grandf
ather had a lot of transactions with the 
villagers, because he used to 
buy milk from them. So she wo
uld Œ so they had a lot of 
people that they knew in th
e villages, and whenever a woma
n was expecting a child, they 
would always ask my  mo ther Œ my  grandmothe
r to come and help her deliver the baby. 
So my  grandmother would always go around 
the neighborhood co llecting baby clothes 
and food for Œ for the Œ the 
Œ the Œ the mother, the young 
mother and the baby. And so 
she was that kind of person.
 And why was she taken away ? There was a Œ a book that 
someone wrote, I can™t remember her name 
right now, about the Jewish community of 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

114
Ioannina
, and the deportation. And sh e interviewed 
su rvivors that were brought in in the 
same Œ the same truck with my  grandmot
her. No, actually the 
same Œ theywere 
transported by trucks from 
Ioannina
 to 
Larisa
(ph), and from 
Larisa
(ph) in boxcars to 
Auschwitz
. And these women survived the c
oncen tration camps and they were 
interviewed by the author of this book, an
d they happened to be riding in  the same 
boxcar. And their Œ a relative of theirs was 
expecting a baby, and her mo ther-in-law was 
frantic, because what are we going to do? Ho
w is the Œ the mother and the baby going to 
survive? And Œ and they quoted
 my  grandmother, saying, d-do
n™t worry, I™ll deliver the 
baby. I know all about babies, I™ll take ca
re of you. So  I don™t know whether she 
delivered Œ whether she delivered
 the baby in the boxcar, or
 when they arrived in the 
concen tration camp. Bu t I do know that they we
re among the first peopl
e to Œ to go to the 
gas chambers, because they Œ th
ey had Œ they Œ th
ey took the elderly 
and the very young 
to the gas chambers. And so  that was the en
d of these wonderful people. It™s something 
[indecipherable]
 my brother and I live with this Œ th is pain all our lives. And it™s just Œ 
there™s no Œ there™s just no an
swer, there™s Œ there™s no an swer, and Œ and wh at makes it 
so painful for Œ for us is that
 there was a possibility
 they could have be
en s Œ they could 
have surv ived, they could have Œ it was late
 enough in the war. The 
countryside was free. 
The partisans were there. They could ha Œ 
Greece
 is a mountainous country, they could 
have left, they could have surviv ed. And it di
dn™t happen. It Œ it™s a Œ we™ll Œ we™ll just 
never Œ we™ll never rest. I-It™s a pain we™ll ne
ver Œ always carry with us. When I went to 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman

115
Ioannina
 in  2005, I went to the synagogue, th e only remaining synagogue inside the Œ 
the walls, the castle, th-the 
froúrio
, as they call it, that™s still standing there, and it was 
renovated thanks to the generosity  of Amer
ican women o-of that background. And the 
walls are lined with marble pl
aques on wh ich the names of all 
the victims, all the people 
who were deported, on marble 
plaques with  the day of Œ the date of their birth Œ the 
names and the date of their birth. And th-the  entire synagogue interior is Œ is covered 
with these plaques. It was my Uncle 
Mikhail
(ph) that the Œ a younger brother of my  
father, wa Œ he™s a survivor of the concentr
ation camp, he™s the one who collected all the 
information; the names, the occupations, date
 of births of all the people who perished, 

and then they etched their 
names in marble an-and Œ an
d there is a Œ  it™s a Œ a good 
monument, you know, a way to rememb er them
. But it is Œ it is so painfu l to think Œ 
when I was in that synagogue, I Œ I had alread
y learned a lot about the history of Œ of the 

community, and how rich their lives were, ri
ch in Œ in long traditions, they Œ these 
unchanged traditions for hundreds of years.
 And it all perished overnight, literally 
overnight. So with Œ with 
my  aunt Œ with  my  cousin
 Nina
, when we were in the 
synagogue, and Mr. 
Samwheel
(ph), who joined the partisan
s during the war, and this is 
how he survived, he joined th
em as a young man. Now, when  I visited he was an elderly 
person. But he Œ he had a beau
tiful voice, and he knew how to  play a musical instrument. 
And he took it upon himself to Œ to learn 
the liturgy, because he™s the one who condu Œ 
conducts services in the synagog
ue, only very  few times, on like 
Yom Kippur
. T h at is

when relatives and friends from other cities in  
Greece
, they come to the synagogue. And 
so Œ so he Œ he chants the litu
rgy. And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin 
Nina
, a survivor of 
Auschwit z
; he, a partisan; and I, we recited 
Kaddish
. And it was the 
mo st me mo rab le mo men t o f  my  life. An d  when  
I looked at the wall, there were the names 
of our relatives, and Œ and cousin s that were 
my age when they were taken. And I s-sort 
of Œ I Œ I Œ I appreciate life. I™m very consci
ous that I was Œ I was just very, very, very 
lucky to survive. So I™m Œ I™m one of the 
very  few Œ among the very few Greek Jewish 
survivors. And Œ and now I™m Œ we™re Œ I™m eter
nally grateful to whoever ever helped us 
to survive those terrible years. And there were 
many people with small acts of Œ of Œ just 
a kind wo rd here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in 
Ka maria
, or Œ or the 
blanket, in spite of the lice, 
they Œ they shared everything 
they had, and I am Œ we™re the 
Œ eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of 
Psilovrahos
. 
Psilovrahos 
is a very 
special, special, very speci
al place for me. I™m sorry. 
Q: No, don™t apologize. When
 I think about what you™re saying and what you™re feeling 
is, you Œ you don™t cry from your own experi
ence, you cry because other people didn™t 
survive. It™s Œ it™s different. 

A: Yes. That is Œ  
Q: Because your experience is
 Œ was not horrible for you Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ in a certain way. 

 
Interview with Ninetta Feldman  
 
September 14, 2010 
 

 
 
117
A: No, not at all, it was Œ it is
 the loss that is so 
painfu l, the loss, and Œ and knowing that 
Œ that there™s nothing you can 
do, and Œ and it isn™t, you k
now, th Œ you know, people 
think that, you know, da Œ time 
will Œ will Œ will heal the wound, and that is not so. Not 
for me. 
Q: You think ab out this all the time, don™t you? 

A: Yes, I do. And Œ a-and it™s such an enorm
ous loss. And a-as Œ as I advance in  years, 
all I can do, I feel, is talk Œ talk about it 
so that people will reme
mber them. They will 
have a memo ry of their names, 
at least, they existed. They 
were kind people. So  wh en my  
Aunt 
Rebecca
, who was my father™s youngest sister, 
and she and her fami ly survived  in 
Egypt
, see, because they lived in 
Alexandria
 during the war, then after the 
[indecipherable]
 took over, and they had to  Œ to leave 
Egypt
, they came to 
Paris
. Well, 
she came to visit us about maybe 
10 years ago. And she had left 
Ioannina
 when she was 
17 years old. Sh e got 
married to my Uncle 
Laylee
(ph), and then  they moved to Œ to 
Alexandria
, 
Eg ypt
. So  she would come back  to visit 
her family. So sh
e retained that 
period of Œ of Œ of the family
 as th ough it was encased in am
ber. I always thought of that, 
that Œ that it was like time stood still for her 
for that period. And so
 she would Œ she had 
so many stories to tell about my  father™s brothers and sister, about their wives, their Œ 
their families, all of their Œ their lives. An
d she was a very articul
ate person and she loved 
to talk and I spent a lot of 
time with her. And then one day 
I realized, she is a treasure 
trove of information. And so 
I asked her if she would be w
illing for me to interview her

using the family album. And ev
en though it was Œ I know it 
was painful for her to talk 
about her brothers and their families and her si
ster that perished, an
-and her parents, she Œ 
she let me interview her. I was not a professi
onal interviewer, of course, but I Œ I really 
treasure the information that she gave me, becau
se for a brief period of time, she brought 
these people to life. A nd they
 were Œ they had their own ac
hievements in life, their own 
disappointments and Œ and wh ile in life pe
rhaps they were ordinary  people, having 
perished the way they  did, 
they became extr
aordin ary.  
Q: Well, I know there™s much 
mo re to say, because your Œ your life went on for many 
years. 

A: Yes. 
Q: But I think we have to end now,
 and I just want to thank you. 
A: Sure. 
Q: I™m very grateful to you for 
being willing to talk with us.  
A: Thank you fo r giving me the opportunity .

nd it was a very, very emotional reunion.

A: That is the very same house, yes, that  we saw earlier. This

some point during th e occupation.

same building. They ™re taking in  
Agrinion

 authorities. In the village, 
my  parents obtained baptismal papers from,
 I guess the priest, and they sent these 
documents to 
Ag rinion
 and they were issued the 
I.D.
 cards by the German authorities.

Greek Christian names. Names of my

have all been changed to so
und more Christian Greek. The 
interesting th ing about these 
I.D.s

my  huge bow perche
d on my head. It 
was Œ it was the latest in fashion for little girls. 
Q: Do you remember wh
at year this was? 
A: I don™t know the exact year, but I believe 
that it was perhaps ™46 Œ ™46 or ™47, I™m not 
sure.

stalactites fro m the Œ the cave of 
Arapo

e day that we were in that cave.
