A: A great Polish hero. He was involved i n both insurgencies agai nst the Russians, 
and provided all of arms and support throughout the Jewish communit y of 
Poland 

to Œ in support of the fight against the Russians, and the Russian anti-Semitism. 

Q: Isn™t that interesting? So few people have such an unusual family connection, or 

blend.  
A: Yes. 
Q: So what uprisi ngs would these have been? 

A: Well, one was i n 1930, and Œ  

Q: You mean 1830. 

A: 18 thir Œ 30, and the other one™s in 1861. 

Q: I see. And did your father know this rabbi? Did he ever see hi m, or Œ 

A: No, he knew hi s daughter, who was her Œ hi s grandmot her, and it™s an interesting 
story. The y were both born in 
Kraków
, and she lived in the 
Kazimierz
, which was 
the Jewish section. Her father was the rabbi of the oldest synagogue in 
Poland
, in 
Kraków
. And as young kids, they met, fell in love, and both families didn™t want to 
have anythi ng to do wit h them, because one was Catholic family, and the other one 

was a Jewi sh Orthodox. And so they had t o leave 
Kraków
 and move to 
Warsaw
. 
Q: So, explain to me, it  was your father™s grandmother Œ 

A: That™s ri ght.

Q: Œ 
who was 
Œ who was Œ  
A: Whom 
Œ 
Q: Œ the daughter of the rabbi? 

A: That™s correct. 

Q: So it™s a little bit like 
Tevya™s
 family on ﬁ
Fiddler on the Roof
,ﬂ where one of 
his young daughters, th-the last one, marries somebody who™s not Jewish, but a 
Gentile. 

A: Well, he was extremely object ive, and she was well-educated, she was Engli sh 

speaking. But when she wanted to marry out of the Jewish faith, that was just t oo 

much for a chief rabbi.  

Q: So Œ so, your father™s grandfather, what kind of famil y did he come from? He 

was the Christian element in this, right?  
A: Right. His grand Œ his grandfather, the husband of the daughter of 
Meisels
, was a 
famous doctor, and he practiced in a town called 
Radom
 clo Œ between 
Kraków
 
and 
Warsaw
. 
Q: So this was Œ atha Œ on both si des, educated people. 

A: Very much so. Very much so. 

Q: Oka y. And it also sounds Œ I mean, one of the questions that I usuall y ask is, 

how much of a person™s family hi story was told to them? And someti mes people 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

don™t have much, because no one talked t o them as a littl e child, but it sounds to me 
that your father told you very Œ 
a l
ot about your family™s Œ  
A: Well, he told me that after the war. He cert ainly didn™t  tell me duri ng the war, 

when I was growing up, when I was 10 years old, 15 years old, because it was too 

dangerous to know that  you had a Jewish ancestor. Because accordi ng to the 
German law, m y father was consi dered Jewish. I wasn™t, but Œ the third generation, 
so that was kept a secret until after the war. My mother, of course, told me her 

story, there was no problem there. 

Q: Uh-huh. So, what was her story? 
Tell mea lit
tle bit about that. 

A: Well, her story was that she was born in a town called 
Mielitz
, out side of 
Kraków
, and she Œ as a young girl she came t o 
Warsaw
, and went t o a ball, and 
met  this handsome, young officer of the Polish legions, who was my father. And 
the y got married, and t hey sta yed in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: Did she have si blings? 
A: Yes. She Œ she was the oldest of four siblings, and her mother died when she was 

11 years ol d, of 
TB
, and she basically brought  up the siblings, so she was very 

mat ernal. 

Q: Which mea
ns that even though she came from, let™s sa y, an educat ed, elite 

family, she had some duties on her that are not  usual for children growing up.

A: Yes Œ 
Q: The y can be quite 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 
A: Œ yes, was a big Œ so she waited to have me for about 10 years after the marriage, 

because she enjoyed the freedom, and being able to travel  with m y father, to 

Moscow
, to 
Paris
 where the Œ where he worked. And Œ but duri ng the war, she had 
to work as a farmhand, in order to feed us during the war. So she was not be yond 

being able t o do anyt hing that was necessary i n life. Hard work. 

Q: We™ll come Œ we™ll come to that, we™ll come to that. Did you know her Œ your 

aunts and uncles from her si Œ 

A: Yes, I did. 

Q: Yeah?  

A: Most of them. 
Q: Well, so what were their names, on your mother™s side of the fami ly? 
A: Well, there was a Œ a young stepdaughter called 
Sofia
(ph), and there was a Œ 

another one, actual sist er called 
Steffa
(ph), and Œ and a brother called 
Stefan
. 

Q: Oka y, t hose were from your mother™s side of the family. 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: What about your father™s side of the family?

A: My father had two siblings, a ya Œ a sister three years younger, and a brother 
who was 10 years younger. 

Q: And what were t heir names? 

A: Her name was 
Stani s

, and his was 
 
. 
Q: Uh-huh, 

. In your memoirs, which I read, you mention an Uncle 
Norbert
. Whowas Uncle 
Norbert
, in the family scheme? 
A: Uncle 
Norbert
 was my father™s tutor during the Russian occupation of 
Warsaw
. 
The s Œ y- you™re not all owed to be taught i n Polish, schools were taught in Russian. 

So  my 
Œ t he family hired this young lawyer. In exchange for living in the apartment, 
he was teaching the Œ m y father and his sister the Polish history, Poli sh mathematics 

and all kinds of languages. So he became the hero of m y father, and when I was 

born, he became m y godfather. 
Q: Oh, I see. 
A: And he also married later, m y aunt, m y father™s sister. So he was my uncle, and 

m y godfather.
 

Q: I see. And when you talk about this Russian occupation, what years would we be 

talking about? 

A: Well, this was up to 19 Œ eight Œ 1914. 

Q: I see. 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

A: A hundred and t went y-five years of occupation by 
Russia
. 
Q: Oka y. And it encompassed 
Warsaw
? 
A: Very much so. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Very much so. 
Q: Oka y. You Œ so Œ 
bu
t some part of your family was i n 
Kraków
, which would 
have been part of the Austro-Hungarian
 
empire in the 19
th
 century. 
A:Yes, m y de 
Œ m y m other came from Austro-Hungarian emp Œ 
Mielitz
, and 
Tarnow
, who are where she was born and brought up, was part of the Austro-
Hungarian empire. 
Q: A quest ion that  is always Œ I-I™ve alwa ys been curious about, was there a 

different sensibility amongst people who were brought up in one part of 
Poland
, 
versus anot her, given t he different rulers, and the different policies of those rules? 
A: In Œ in Œ in some ways, yes. Administrativel y, militarily. I mean, t he Poles had to 

fight in th-those armies, that were either Russian, German or Austrian. And they 

were Œ th-the y had different discipline, different ways of fighting. Th
e s
ame thing 
with a civil  admini stration. So, when 
Poland
 became independent in 1918, it was 

quite a problem to start administering the country in one single way. 

Q: Yeah, because people had different Œ 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

11
 
A: Different backgrounds. 
Q: Yeah, different traditions. So what are some of the stories that your mother 

would tell you about her own family, given that she™s descended from royalty? 

A: Well, she didn™t  know much about the Œ the Œ her origi nal background. Her 

stories were more about her parents, and her grandparents.  
Q: Mm-hm. What did your grandparents, t hat  is, her parents, how di d the y support 
the family, and the same question will be for your father™s side: how did his parents 

support their family? 

A: Well, m y 
Œ the parents were landowners, on m y mother™s side. On m y father™s 

side, the y ha Œ his father married a shoemaker™s daughter i n 
Warsaw
, and they had 
a hard ti me, financial ly. And they Œ the grandfather didn™t help him, because 

although he married somebody who was not acceptable, society-wi se, so did his 
oldest son 
Julian
. And he didn™t have anyt hing to do wit h the grandchildren unt il 
m y father was 18, when, for the first time, he met  his grandparents. 
Q: Oh m y. Oh my, what family dramas. 

A: Yes, yes, it was Œ vit Œ 
typ
-typical Vict orian rules and regulations. 
Q: Yeah. But I take it, because the y were educated, the y must have spoken more 

than one language. Is that so?  

 
Interview with Julian Kulski  
 
September 2 5

12
 
A: Oh yes, well, m y fat her spoke Œ had to speak Russian, and my mot her spoke 
German, and the y lived in 
Paris
, so the y both spoke French. And later in life, they 

learned Engl ish. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you have any earliest memori es from your own childhood? 

A: Yes, I have a memory of my father savi ng me from a very cruel German nurse. I 
was 
a 
very ena Œ independent boy, and didn™t always do what peo
ple wanted met o 
do, but what I want ed t o do. And the Œ the nurse was very cruel. She was ta Œ 
take 
me under a bridge and put some hard stones and make me kneel on for Œ for an hour 

when I was five years old. So that™s m y first memory. And one evening she 
tol d me 

sh-she would beat me i n the middle of the night, wake me up. And my parents were 

going out t o the opera, and I begged my mother not to go, and sure enough, an hour 

after they left, or half an hour, she started beating me. And fortunately, m y father 
left the tickets to the ball behind, and entered while she was beati ng me, and she Œ 
he threw her the Œ out of the building. So he became a great hero of mi ne.  

Q: A sad Œ  I mean, a very sad thing for Œ to happen to a little boy, but  a good wa y 

for a parent to appear, you know. 

A: Well, it prepared me for what was coming later on. When the Germans came, I 

wasn™t surprised at thei r cruelty.

Q: That™s so sad, I mean, it™s Œ yeah. 
Wh at 
Œ what kind of family life do you 
remember? And I mean this in many wa ys. If you could describe your living 
situation Œ  did you have an apart ment, did you have a house? Where was it, and so 

on? From the earliest days, you Œ 

A: Well, we lived i n an apartment overlooking the 
Vistula
 river. It™s a beautiful 
apartment on the fifth floor, overlooking t he 
Vistula 
river. And then i n 1935, the y 
build a house, specially designed by an architect, a landscape architect, in the 

suburb of 
)
 of 
Warsaw
, and we moved there. So the Œ most of m y 
memories are from 
)
, which was a Œ 
a n
ew suburb, mainly used by the 
government and mi litary el ite.
 
Q: Mm-hm. And was it  north or west, or south of 
Warsaw
? 
A: It was north of 
Warsaw
, the most northern part of 
Warsaw
. 
Q: Oka y. Was it far Œ was it Œ did it take a long ti me to get into the center of the city 

from there? 

A: No, the communication was pretty good. There were good streetcars, and I used 

to travel even as a young boy, all over 
Warsaw
, on streetcars.  
Q: So would it take half an hour, or an hour, t o get from your home by streetcar? 

A: Oh, about 20 minutes to downtown. 

Q: That™s not bad. 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski  
 
September 2 5

14
 
A: No. 
Q: That™s no Œ that™s not far at all. And what kind of a househol d was it in this 

house? How many people lived there, did your mother have help? Do a Œ 

A: Well, m y mother had three helpers; two women and one man. And besides us, 

there lived t wo aunt s, m y father™s sister and also a cousin of m y mother™s, who was 
Œ who came over from 
Japan
. She was a Polish consul in 
Tokyo
, and brought in a 
load of Japanese thi ngs, music, and kimonos and Œ 
Q: Must have 
been exotic.
 

A: Œ would entertai n me as a young boy. So there™s a Œ and she had Œ th-there were 

four separate apartment s, little one room apartments where these aunts lived. They 

were really designed for my sister and for me when I grew up, so that  we could li ve 

at home, but have a Œ our own separate place. 
Q: How clever. I mean, how clever. But it meant that you had not  onl y your mother 

and your father there, but an extended family. 

A: Yes, we had an extended family, and during the war, we had a l ot of refugees. 

Jewish families, Christi an families, so that the house was really full during the war. 

Q: Tell me a little bit about these aunts. What did the y Œ you mentioned the one 

who was a consul i n 
Japan
. 

A: Yeah.

Q: What were the ot her two aunts like? 
A: Wel
l, th-the Œ th Œ 
m y 
Œ 
m y 
Œ the other aunt was my father™s sister, who was an 
intellectual and a hi storian, and Œ and interested in poetry, and int erested in 

architecture so that she Œ she got me interested in architecture, an earl y stage. 

Q: Mm-hm. And was t here another aunt? 
A: Well, there was another aunt during the war. 
Q: I see. 

A: Who was a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a refugee.

A: Well, one Œ 
one of 
Œ yes, I went  to school before the war. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: There was a school not far from m y house, I would be able to walk to it, and 
back. 
Q: Do you have any m emories from school? 

A: No, except I didn™t l ike it.  

Q: Was it a public school, or Œ 

A: It was very much a public school, because my father felt that he was a Œ 
v ery 

interested t hat I not be brought up in an el ite environment, and was Œ there were a

lot of poor boys, from poor backgrounds, who gave me a hard ti me. But that™s 
exactlywhat  myfather wanted,to strengthen me.
 
Q: Was yourfamily religious?
 
A: No, not Œ well, yes and no. My mother™s side was extremely rel igious, m y 

father™s side was not. 
Q: And do you thi nk Œ what woul d be the reason, you would think, that the y were 
not?
 
A: Well, m y father was against the Œ what he felt the Catholic church was holding 

back, the social progress. And he was very interested in equality, and i n everybody 

having the same rights. This was something that he fought for during the first World 

War,  
was for Œ not only for 
Poland™s 
independence, but al so for Œ give everybody 

the opportunity and equality. And he felt the church was in Œ is Œ  in Œ  i-in Œ 
like in 
France
, where he studi ed, was holding them back. He was also very much against 
anti-Semiti sm, so that was one of the reasons he Œ 
actually, he becam e em 
Œ 
a 

Mason, and he was very much interested i n developmen
t of 
Poland
, t he social and 
economic and physical. And then when he became the ma yor of 
Warsaw
,  of 
course, he was able to put these pl ans int o execution. 

Q: And Œ and, was your mother religious?

A: My mother was reli gious, and m y grandmother was ext remely reli gious. So, I Œ 
but my father decided to baptize us in Protestant church, and Œ and tol d us that 

when we were 21, we should choose the religion, will we want t o be Jewish, 

Christian, Catholic,or Protestant.
 
Q: Really? 
A: And th- that really gave me a very difficult time when I was growing up, because 
I was Œ I had to make that decision. For about four or five years, I reall y strove to 

try to find out, and I never did find. 

Q: That was going to be m y next question. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yes. 

A: I s Œ I™m a Chri stian, yes, I guess, but t h Œ 
I™m 
Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ very proud of my Jewish background, I™m proud of my father, who was a 

Mason, and a freethinker. So I™ve been very fortunate in my inheri tance. 

Q: And the values. 

A: You™re right Œ 

Q: It sounds like also the values 

A: Œ

Q: Tell me a little bit about your father™s career. How did he start  out , how did he 

progress to the point that he held t he positi ons that he did? 

A: Well, m yfather was 
Œ 
his mother,the shoe
maker™s daughter, was a socialist and 
an 
[indeci pherable]
. She was in t he underground, against the Russians. So he was 

brought up in his home in very patriotic Polish background. The y had secret press 

there, they had arms in the apartment when he was growing up. Then, he wasn™t 

able to go to university in 
Poland
, so he went to 
Belgium 
to study engineering. And 
then he interrupted his studies, because the first World War started, and he joined 

the 
Pilsudski™s
 l egions, and fought against 
Russia
, and was very badly wounded on 

the Ukrainian front. He was shot through by the machine gun, through the stomach, 
and was in hospital for about six t o eight mont hs. And it affected his whole life, his 
whole nervous system. It™s a Œ the only reason he survived, because was very cold 

winter, it was January, and he froze on the Œ on the front, in the Œ but then he came, 

after the war, and then soon after was the Polish-Soviet war, whi ch 
Poland 
won. It 

was the Œ one of the two countries that ever beat the 
Sovi et Union
, 
Afghanistan
 
and 
Poland
. And he was back in the army, he was in the intelligence service, 

mil itary intelligence, and he was very close to 
Marshall Pilsudski
.

Q: So let i t Œ let me interrupt. For many people, some of these events are not going 
to be familiar, so I™d like you to tell me the dates. When was this Poli sh-
Soviet war, 

when did it take place? And tell us a little bit about who was mi Œ 
Marshall 

Pilsudski
. 

A: The Œ the Soviet-Polish war started 1920 - ™21. It was an attack of 
Lenin
, of 
trying to take over
 
Europe
, so that 
Poland™s 
newly formed army, under the 
leadership of 
Marshall  Józef Pilsudski
, who was the 
George Washi ngton
 of
 
Poland
; t ogether with some volunteers from 
America
 Œ t he Americans provided 
some pilot s, who fought in the 
Ko

 foundation squadron during that war. 
There were some Ital ians, and some French, and some English, who supported it, in 

order to defend 
Europe
 from the Soviets. And at first the Polish forces were 

winning, and then the Soviet forces got all the way to 
Warsaw
, and it looked li ke 
that the Œ 
Poland
 was going to lose, and the y were going to enter the rest of 

Euro pe
, but the y Œ wha-what is toda y called t he miracle on the 
Vi stula
, 
Marshall 
Pilsudski
, toget her wit h 
Marshal l Foch
, the French support came up with a very 

good milit arystrategy, and 
beat the Soviets, and took hundreds of thousands of 
Soviet prisoners of war, and th-that was the end of the war, th-the Œ the Soviets 

capitulated. And part of the agreement was that 
Poland
 could recoup all the arts,  

paintings, jewelry, and thingswhichth
-the Russians stole from 
Poland
. And my

father was the head of t he commission in 
Moscow
, which together wi th m y mot her, 
who went t hrough and brought all the anti ques, and Œ and Œ and Œ and things which 
they found in museums, which were Polish, back to 
Poland
.  
Q: What a fascinating Œ 
A: So the y thu Œ t he y had a interesting life during the early days, and then, after 
that, m y father decided that he wanted to become a political scientist, and he went 
to Œ to Œ to Œ to 
Fr
a nce
. My mother worked, in order for him to study, and he went 
to 
So rbonne
, and he got his degree in pol itical science. So when the y got back to 
Poland
, he was going t o be in the Œ Mini ster of Foreign Affairs, but instead, he 

ended up with the treasury department, and then in 1935, became vice-
president of 

Warsaw
. 
Q: I™ll Œ okay, I was thi nking of asking this question later, but I™ll ask it now: it is 
unusual for a city t o have a president, or a vice-
president, usually they have ma yors. 
What is Œ what was 
Warsaw™s 
situation Œ 
A: The difference between the ma yors and the presidents is that l arge cities like 

Warsaw
, 
Kraków
, 

, 
Gdansk
, have presidents. Smaller towns, smaller 
cities, have ma yors. 

Q: I see.

A: So that™s the only di fference, and it™s basically the same functions, but a different 
title. And since 
Warsaw
 was the capitol of 
Poland
, it was the most important city, 
therefore the president of 
Warsaw
 was second in line to the president of 
Poland
.  
Q: Oh, really? 

A: Right. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And after the Œ when Œ when t he war st arted, the Polish government left, and the 

president of the city was ste Œ 
Ste
 
, who fought against the russi Œ 
Germans for a whol e month, and he, in fact, became the head of the Polish state, 

and the Germans arrested him i mmediately after they conquered 
Warsaw
, and shot 
hi m a month later, killed hi m. And Œ 
and then m y 
father became Œ m y father was an 
old friend of his still from childhood da ys, and the y were together in the legions, 
the y were together in t he prison camp, the y were together in 
Moscow
, they were 
together in the treasury, and then in Polish cit Œ in the 
Wa
rsaw
 city hall. So that  
was then the natural  that he followed, and was appointed president, during the 
warti me years, from 1939 to 1944. 

Q: That is an amazi ng Œ an amazing story in and of itself, and when we are into t he 

war years, I am going t o want to know more about it, because, I mean, the questions 

that can come up for being in such a posit ion, i ncredible.

A: It was a horrible position. 
Q: Yes, yes. But going back now t o his Œ to hi s career, he made then, a jump from 

the treasure ministry, into, let™s say, the municipality. 

A: Right. 

Q: Oka y. And what was his Œ what were his responsibili ties as vice-president? 
A: As vice- president Œ as pres Œ it was the whole transportation system, buses, 
streetcars, fu-future metro. Besides that, t he y electricity, all  the indust rial Œ 
city 
industrial concerns. Labor. Th-the Œ there were four vice-president s, and he wa Œ th-

th-the Œ this wa Œ t his was his responsibi lity. 

Q: Oka y. And did your mother finish university? 

A: No, m y mother never went to t he university. She was well-read, and very 

intelligent, but she never went to university, she married early. 
Q: Mm-hm. It™s quite an accomplishment t o help put your husband through college, 
you know Œ 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Œ particularly if that ™s the 
So rbo nne
.  
A: Right. 

Q: How did she do it? 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

A: Well, she Œ she worked. She taught Polish to some Russians in fra Œ 
Paris
. She 
did everythi ng she coul d in order t o live on basically pennies. So, it was very 

difficult ti mes for them, but the y managed it. And she wrote her memoirs, and m y 

fa
ther wrote his memoi rs: my father™s are publ ished, m y mother™s are still 
unpublished. 
Q: And was this before you were born, all of this? 
A: Oh yes. This was all of when he wa Œ 
she wa 
Œ that™s why she was waiting. She 

wanted to put hi m through university, to Œ to give hi m t he opportunity, and only 

after he became 
Œ started to go up in the treasury depart ment, the y decided to have 

me.
 
Q: I see. And tell me now a little bit about their personalit ies. What kind of a 

personality your father had, and your mother had. 
A: My mother was very outgoing. She loved people, and everybody loved her. Her 
mat ernal instinct being bar Œ having to bri ng up her sisters and brother when she 

was a teenager, taught her how to take care of it. Also, she had an example of her 

father, who was also very interested in Œ in hel ping people. The towns that they 

lived were very large Jewish population, and her father was known for taking care, 

and helping the povert y stricken Jews. And so m y mother was brought up in the 

spirit of looking after people, and taking care. And this was one of the problem t hat 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

24
 
I had with her, because she was tryi ng to take care of me too much, and I was too 
independent. So we™re very much alike, I™m very much like m y mother, but we had 

that problem. We loved each other, but I wanted to be independent , and Œ and this 

lasted the whole li-l ifetime. My father was completely different. My father was 

really quite shy, to start with. He had to overcome it to become a public figure, and 
he did very well in that. But he was an int ellectual. He thought 10 ti mes before he 
spoke, and he was very broadminded, liberal, and a Œ 
a 
Œ a very admired person i n 

Warsaw
, known and admired. Sometimes my mother would get on his nerves 
becauseshe would sa y something justwi thout thinking, 
and that woul d get him Œ 
get him int o apoplexy. 

Q: But it sounds like they were both Œ 
I mean, itsounds 
Œ the y were very strong 

people. 
A: The y were both very strong people. Ver Œ extremely strong peopl e, i-i-in Œ i n 
different wa ys, quite opposite, but ve
ry much inlove.
 
Q: Also very nice. 

A: So the Œ I Œ I was sumb Œ I met a cousi n of mine in Œ i n Œ in 
Poland
 
just months 
ago, and they comparing our bring Œ how we™re brought up. They were rich, and Œ 

but didn™t have love. And we had l ots of love, but we were not so rich.

Q: Yeah, well that™s Œ all of these things are crucial for a child, of course, in thei r 
development. And in many wa ys it  helped, or Œ when you had a strong upbringing, 

when you™re put int o times of stress, sometimes you have some reserves to draw 

upon Œ 

A: Exactly. 
Q: Œ you know.  
A: And I t hink that™s what pulled me through t he war. 

Q: Really. Yeah. So tell me a little bit about Œ you were born in 1929, yes? 

A: Right. 

Q: So 
Hitler
 
comesto powerwhen you™re justfour years old.
 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did Œ from the ti me that you could remember, did your parents talk about history 
and politics and current events at home? 
A: Oh yes, m y father and my Œ and Uncle 
Norbert
 used to talk politics, but the 
closest I got was when I was eight years ol d, I spent summer in 
Bydgoszcz
,
 
which 
is on the Œ a city on the German border. And my so-called uncle, he was one of m y 

father™s warti me buddi es, was the governor of the province, and I was lucky to be Œ 

spend two summers in the governor™s palace. 

Q: Wow.

A: And the y had al so summer place, it was  surrounded by Polish armored troops, 
and I used to Œ was allowed to ride in Poli sh tanks, at eight years old, that was like, 
great fun. 

Q: What a thrill. 

A: And I l oved to swi m Œ  
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and I Œ I Œ I learned how to have great social life, to a point t hat when I got 

home, I told my mother that she didn™t behave like a president™s wife should, sh Œ 

the wa y Aunt 
Hell a
 as the governor™s wife Œ because the y had ball s every week, 

and lots of food and lot s of dancing. And furthermore, I told her Œ tol d that m y 

father should be a ri ght-winger, not a left-winger, and m y mother tol d him that, and 

he burst laughing, that this eight year old was tryi ng to tell hi m how to Œ what kind 
of politics he should have. But I was just interested in all the nice thi ngs. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: All the wonderful cookies, and Œ and chocolates, and one day I even ordered 

eight guys with Œ f-for a ball which didn™t exist, and my uncle caught me and 

chased me around t he palace.
 
Q: How cute. How cute. 

A: So, I Œ I was full of beans.

Q: Yeah. It also sounds that the sense of Œ of what it is t o be Polish was very strong 
in your family. 

A: Well, it Œ it Œ it was not Œ it was only one family. I thi nk that in school, the 

teachers, the family and everybody, was so excited to have a free and independent 

Poland
, free for everybody. The Christians, the Jews were having, you know, 
particularly the Jews had wonderful theaters, and Œ and Œ and social life, and at Œ in 
m y life
, th-there was Œ I didn™t run into any anti-Semitism, because well, the Œ 
m y 
father™s closest friends were Jewish members of the prepe Œ legion police, legion, 

who fought the 
[indeci pherable]
 so the Œ  I wa Œ 
religion wasnotan important part 
in my bri Œ upbringing.  

Q: Well,it also 
Œ I mean, from what you were sayi ng is t hat many people will Œ will 
say intheir testi mo
nies, the y Œ as they™re talki ng about their lives, eit her that there 
was anti-Semitism that the y experienced as Holocaust survivors, or as Jews growing 

up in 
Poland
, or as Pol es who had very little contact with Œ with the Jewish 
community. That™s different for you, and for your family. 

A: Well, it-it-it-it was different in the country, and different in the city. In the city, I 
mean, one-third of 
Warsaw
 were Jewish, and so th Œ and there were a lot of 
Orthodox, and I used t o enjoy, as a boy, going in there and seeing the Œ the food, th-

the laughter, the language, the Œ to me it was very Œ very fascinating, although I

didn™t know I had any Jewish background, it was just very interesting. But th-
th
e 
place where I lived was all Poles of Jewish background, who were the leaders of 
Poland
, i ntel Œ universit y professors, arm y men. Ten percent of Polish officer corps 

were Jewish. So that I didn™t pa y any attention t-to the Œ to that. That™s why I didn™t 

run into it, but I Œ I heard stories that in the country, that it was different, that the 
Or-Orthodox Jews lived separately from the Catholic peasants, and somet imes there 
were problems, but it was never s-something that I saw i n the city.  

Q: Yeah. It wasn™
t part of yourlife.
 

A: No, it wasn™t part of my life. 

Q: Oka y. Tell me about your childhood friends. Did you have any close friends as 

you were growing up? 

A: Well, the Œ the Œ the Œ the closest friend was Œ that I had, was in 
K azimierz
 on 
the 
Vistul a
 in 1939, at the beginni ng of the war; a girl by the name of 
Zula
(ph), 
who was al so of Jewish background, but was Catholic, and we became good 

friends. And then we continued i n Œ in Œ in Œ i n 
Warsaw
, when I got back from t he 
vacation. 

Q: Oka y, so tell me about 
kaz 
Œ 
K azi mierz

Baltic
 
Sea?
 
A: No, no, south. Sorry, south towards 
Kraków

Q: Oka y. 

A: A-
And since 
Poland
 was the main exporter of grain, 
Kazi mierz
 had the places 
for storing grain, and t he 
Vistula 
was the main avenue of going t o the 
Baltic
. And Œ 

but it was a su-summer place, and it™s still a big vacation place. I was there a mont h 

ago with m y wife. And we s Œ we Œ we had Œ m y parents rented a house there, and 

although m y father expected war, he didn™t realize how soon it would happen, and 
just as soon as he got Œ got us sett led in 
Kazimierz

Warsaw

A: Right. 

Q: And what brought you to Œ how did you become friends? What about her Œ  

A: Well, they lived Œ they had a cott age next  t o us, and we just met, I don™t know 

how, but became good friends, and we used to go to the center of 
Kazimierz
, where 

the Œ on particular on t he market da y, when the peasants from the area would bri ng 
their goods to sell, and the Œ the Œ the Jewi sh people woul d Œ who lived in 
Kazimierz
, would buy by horse,sell 
Œ buy horses, sell horses and chi ckens and 
pigs, and Œ  and it was a lot of fun. But it™s an old medieval  town, smal l town square, 
and there was a Œ at the one end was a big cathedral, and ri ght off the center was a 

wooden synagogue. And so Œ

Q: We™ll tal k about that. 

A: Right. 

Q: We™ll tal k about that. It sounds pretty idyllic, as a place, and as a summer Œ 
A: It was an idyllic place, definitely. It was a beautiful summer, and we used to go 
and swi m in the ri ver, and we had th-the run of the place, of the woods, and of the 

square, and it was a beautiful architecture on t he square. A lovely little town.  

Q: And did you, even being only 10 years old, did you sense that there was 

something that was troubling in t he larger poli tical air, or not so much? 

A: Well, wrote the le Œ learned that a year and a half before, when I was in 

Bydgoszcz
, when I was in with the Œ wit h my uncle, the governor, because the 
Polish army was already training, you know, as I said, the tanks. And I also s-saw a 
very funny movie of 
H itler
, making fun of him. So that was the begi nning. And 

then, of course, I start to Œ since then, I got int erested in who 
Hitl er 
was, because he 
looked like s-s-such a funny guy, at the beginning. And t hen I heard all these 

horrible stories about what was happening in 
Germany
. And nobody could bel ieve 
it, you know, it was la Œ un-until we saw it in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: Yeah.

A: And Œ and Œ and then it came with a bang. 
Q: Yeah. So, when your father gets you set tled in Œ in this summer place, and Œ did 

he expect to stay with you, and then was suddenly called back?  

A: Yes, he expected to stay a fi Œ at least a week or 10 da ys, that was his vacation, 

but he was called off to 
Warsaw
, because the Œ he was the not only vice-president, 
but he was the head of the anti-aircraft civilian defense, and he had tens of 

thousands of people trained already for putt ing out fires. In each building there was 

somebody who had Œ t hey had sand and water on the roof, so when t he Germans 

started dropping incendiary bombs, well, they were trying to put out t he fires as 

soon as possible. The Œ the Œ he was responsible for the sirens, for the anti-aircraft 

notifying t he milit ary. 

Q: Do you remember whether you still were in

A: I will never forget September fir Œ ™39, because I was Œ it was the first time in 
m y life that I was really terrified. 
Zula
(ph) and I went out mushroom hunting, and 
was early in the morning, and about 10 o™clock, somewhere around 10 o™clock in 

the morning, there was a terrible noise, and the trees started bending, and right over 

the treetops came out huge black airplanes wit h crosses on it. And we didn™t know 
what it was. We di dn™t wa Œ know that the war started, but  the y were flying to bomb
 
Warsaw
, so they had bombs underneath it . And so we just la y down until the y Œ 
they were Œ there seemed like hundreds of them. There weren™t t
hat many,I™m sure, 

but it appeared to me, t o a little boy, and we were terrified. And then, after they left, 

the trees straightened out, and there was this wonderful silence after the noise. And 

then we loo Œ I looked up at the sky, and there was a eagle circling around. And the 

eagle is the symbol of 
Poland
. This was a white and black eagle 
[indecipherabl e]
. 
And it was something which was so unusual, I Œ I Œ I was Œ the whol e experience, 

first of that noise Œ we run home, and we found out Œ m y mother told us that the war 

started, and she started worrying about m y father, and what was happening in 

Warsaw
, because w-we knew that he had such an dangerous post. 
Q: Did you have a t elephone Œ

A: Yes, but I didn™t. 

Q: You didn™t know. 

A: I was too young to use it, we di dn™t use it. I™d Œ you know, I had my own life 

with Œ wit h 
Zula
(ph), and there was another boy called 
Yendrik
(ph) that lived in 
the same cottage, and we used to do a lot of just running around and doing things 

that boys do Œ 

Q: So Œ 
A: Œ like t hrowing things in the well. 
Q: So once your mother tells you the war starts, do you remember what happened 

next?  

A: Well, I remember that th Œ everybody was t el Œ the Œ t he adults were terrified, 

they was gl ued to the radio, and then two Œ about two weeks later, on the 17
th
 of 
September, the news came that the Soviets attacked the Polish army from behind. 

The y formed an alliance with 
Germany
, and t hey Œ a-and that™s why the Polish

arm y had to surrender, because they couldn™t fight on two fronts. Not Œ 
an
-and both 
of the enemies were m uch stronger. But t here were a lot of soldiers coming through 
Kazimi
erz
, and the la Œ lot of talking about what we should do. I know that my 
mother at one time got all the Œ m y mother and Œ and some other women with 

children got  onto a horse drawn vehicle and went out to Œ to running off towards 
Kraków
, but th-then we turned around, came back the next da y. There was just 
complete chaos on t his Œ the roads, that it Œ people running away from one front to 
the other, being caught either by the Germans, or the Russians.  

Q: Well, it reminds me of that very famous scene in, I think it™s 
Andr
é Wider™s

Katyn
 Œ 

A: Right. 

Q: Œ where there™s a bridge, and people are running on one side Œ

A: Right, right Œ

A: Yes. The y came in, I would sa y in the second week of the war, towards the third 
week, and I was on the square the y came. It wasn™t a market da y. But  the y came on 

motorc ycles, and th Œ i-in cars. And it was a very hot summer, and dry summer, so 

they were all  covered with dust. And so m y first thought was, t he y di dn™t look like 

victors, the y looked like a Œ a losing arm y. But the y were the victors. And then t he y 
brought in the orchestra, 
W ehrmacht 
orchest ra, and the y started playi ng in the 
square, in t his medieval square, mi litary marches. And t he y brought in the Orthodox 

rabbi, and ti ed hi m up t o the roof of the wooden synagogue, and started a fire, and 

made the elders run in to try to save hi m, and they all died right in front of m y e yes. 

And this wa Œ I was 10 and a half years old. And it Œ it was just like

And it was a little bil Œ that there were all toget her about less than a hundred

 that were 

murdered during the war. 

Q: It sounds Œ I mean, t he juxtaposition of a resort town in an idyl lic place Œ

left mone y, so we Œ we had, each one Œ somebody Œ everybody had to do his job, 
and m y mother™s job was to take care of the cow. So she had to take it  to the field,

Q: Did you Œ when you went home, did y Œ I Œ  I would assume you told them all 

about this, that Œ what you saw.

A: Well, after 
Warsaw
 capitulated, towards the end of September
. My father came 
in the li mousine, city limousine to pick us up. He was Œ had probl em walking. The 
Œ had probl ems wi th hi s legs because he di d so much running around the city during 

the siege of 
Warsaw
. He looked t ired, and si ck. And they took us to 
Warsaw
, and I 
remember entering t he cit y, and seeing dead people on the sides, a-and dead horses 
and ruined buildings, and m y mot her burst crying, and got so sick that he had to 
stop the car, because she threw up when she saw everything that was happening. I 

mean, my father knew that Œ was used to it, after a month. But for us, coming from 

this idyllic place, it  was just a Œ such a shock. When we got to our house, the house 

didn™t have any wi ndows left, you know, because of the bombs. And there was Œ  

Q: Was your neighborhood bombed? 

A: Sections of the Œ of th Œ of Œ of Œ of Œ 
o f some 
Œ some buildings were bombed, 
but most of the bombs fell on downtown. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And hospitals, churches, synagogues, that™s where the y were bombing. 

Q: And your father took you to your home? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Was there any change inside your house?

A: Well, it was full of glass, you know, a-and Œ and dirt, and it was the same house, 
but it wasn™t. Fort unately, before the winter, we were able t o get the glass back in 

the windows, because it was a very hard wi nter, a very col d winter, and there was a 

shortage of fuel. It was very difficult, and the Germans st arted the terror 

immediately. They arrested m y father™s boss, the president . They arrested my 
father. They came to our house, and I was 10 and a half years old. I was pla ying on 
the floor with m y balsa ships. And I had German ships, and I had Polish ships. And 

I remember t hese three Gestapo men comi ng in and searching the house, and one of 

them stopped by and spoke in broken Poli sh, and asked who was winning this war? 

And I said, of course, 
Poland
 is winning the war. But it™s interesting that this guy, 
today, is 96 years old, and he is the one who admitted that the Germans killed 

President 

a few weeks later, in 
Warsaw
. My father Œ 
ev erybo dy 
thought at Œ til now that he was Œ died in a concentration camp. But he sa ys that Œ 
and th-this was examined by the Polish courts, and the y pretty much decided that™s 

a true story. And I agree with it. But it™s t his guy that talked to me about the ships, 

that came out Œ 

Q: What™s hisname?
 
A: I can™t remember hi s name, but  he Œ he Œ he was a Silesian. He was Œ he and his 

brother, Silesians, joined the Gestapo, but he left a year later, joined the

professor. And just now, two years ago, he notified the Polish government that he 
wanted to tell the st ory of what happened. And he also ta-talks about m y father 

appearing for intervi ew by the Gestapo headquarters. They were call ed in. The y 

wanted to know about the foreign diplomatic corps having left 
Warsaw
, and what 
happened, and th Œ how come that  Œ th-the president of 
Warsaw
 was making such 
anti-
Hitler 
speeches towards the world about all the Œ the cri mes t hat  the Germans 
were committed on Œ 

Q: Civilians. 

A: Œ civilian popul ation. 

Q: This was President 
 
?  
A: President 
 
, right, and my father, the vice-
president. And 
Œ and he 
remembered Œ this Gestapo man remembers now that the y came i n dressed to a 
T
, 
with the hats on, and elegantly looking, just Œ and th-th-the y were very mad that 

they were being interviewed by low level ess Œ Gestapo men, rather t han some high 

level dignit aries. The y felt it was an insult . 

Q: It probably was. 

A: It was. Well, they di dn™t have it Œ but t he Œ

was offered to form a 
Polish government, collaborative government;  he refused, so he was useless. And th

Œ he sa ys t hat the y took him to the park and he tried to escape, and he was shot. 
Well, he was executed, right in the middle of 
Warsaw
. And then, he is buried 
somewhere on that Œ on th-the out side of 
Warsaw
, in a ess Œ what was then an 
SS
 
camp. And there™s no way of finding the body. There™s a memori al in Œ i-i-in t he pr 

Œ 
Warsaw
 cemetery, but it Œ 
it™s empty 
Œ  
Q: So Œ 

A: Œ because we never found the body. 

Q: So it wa Œ wa Œ can I understand it correctly, t hat it was assumed until just t wo 

years ago, t hat he di ed in a concentration cam p? 

A: Yes. Yes. And there were all kinds of stories, that he was in 
Dachau
, that he was 
killed during the
 Warsaw
 uprising, that he was ki Œ li-like the head of the Polish 
undergroundarmy, the General 
Groetravetski
, and evidently it wasn™t true. He was 
killed right  then in 
Warsaw
. 
Q: And tell  me then, how do you make the connection that it™s exactly this person 

who stopp ed in your house Œ 

A: Beca-
Because he reme 
Œ because in his statements to the Polish government Œ 
and it™s Œ i t™s lengt hy, it™s about 25 pages, he mentions coming and Œ and Œ and 

interview to our house, few days after the ci ty was taken over, and my sister and I 

were the wit nesses. And m y sister remembers that the guy got sick, he got the cold,

or something, was throwing up downstairs. And asked for a glass of water, m y 
mother made hi m some tea. So details like that, that he remembers how m y father 

was dressed, he remembers m y playing with t he things. And I remember him 

because of Œ of th Œ of th Œ I was so surprised that a Gestapo man would ask a 

question li ke that, i n Polish. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So Œ so he Œ he is Œ he is a rare person. I think he is pretty much dying now, but 

before he died, I guess he wanted t o get it off his shoulders.  

Q: It™s amazing. It™s amazing. 

A: It™s an amazing story. Amazing. 

Q: It™s amazing. 

A: And, of course, they haven™t found the body, but this is the Œ  m y father spent his 
whole lifetime, unti l he died, looking for his friend™s body in 
Germany
, and in Œ 
and in German televisi on, and Œ and nobody came up, and nobody knew anything 
about it. There were all  kinds of stories, you know, that people made up. But th-the 

Œ I think that Œ I believe that this is the st ory, because I remember t his guy. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. And it sounds that he would be in a positi on to know. 

A: Well, he Œ he was the translator, right. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. Unbelievable. Well, you know Œ

A: And he was tol d by the guys who shot


, that th-the Œ the less he 
knows, the better. The y didn™t want to give hi m the detail s, but t he y t old hi m that he 
was sh Œ that he was ki lled. 

Q: If you ever remember his name, let me know, and we™ll add it Œ  
A: Well, I™ve got it in Œ at home. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: This begs the questi on: President 
 
 is execut ed right  away because he 
is no longer useful. And your father then takes over his position in 1939, and is in it 

for the next five horrible years. 

A: Right. 

Q: How did he survive? How was it that he was not executed? 
A: Oh, he was given an order by 

 to continue taking care of the city, and 
of the people. He was elected by the underground Polish government. The Polish 

government  was in 
Londo n
, but Polish underground Œ 
underground w
as in 
Warsaw
, and th-the y made m y father the successor to 

. But the 
Germans, who needed t o have the ci ty operating well, and the y didn™t have the 

manpower, because most of them were on Œ in the arm y. And they needed the city 

to be runni ng properly. So they Œ th-the y made my father the ma yor. 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

Bürgermeister
 was his title. So he was the president of Œ on the Œ from the Poli sh 
government ™s side in 
Lo ndo n
, and the underground government, but as far as the 

Germans were concerned, he was the 
Bürgermeister
. So some of the pole Œ 

citizens, of course, who had Œ who were not i nvol Œ who didn™t  know about the 

underground, thought t hat m y father was a collaborator. And that the whole city hall 
was a collaborator. Then there were tens of thousands of individuals
 Œ 
it™s a huge 
city, million and a half Œ in order t o operate, that was a very big bureaucracy. And 

in order to run properly; the electricity, the t ransportation, the b Œ the schools, the 

whole system. So th Œ and the fortunate thing for my father, and I thi nk this is why 

he was able to survive, although he was arrested three, four times by t he Gestapo, 

because the y have Œ they suspected that he was a member of the underground, and 

that he was anti-German. But they Œ there was one indivi dual, call ed 
Ludwig Leist
, 
who was with 
Hitler
 in the first World War, in the Bavarian regi ment. He was a 

regular soldier like
 Hitler
. But the y got to know each other, and in Œ who in 1934 or 

™35, joined the Nazi part y and joined the Brownshirts. And sp Œ went up very 

quickly, although he di dn™t have any Œ much education, if any, became a general in 

the essda Œ 
Sturmabteilung
, 
SA
. And he was trained to be the supervisor of 
Warsaw
. His first job in 
Warsaw
 was to creat e the Jewish ghetto, before he

became the so
-
called governor 
of the city. And he worked with Œ what™s his name? I 
keep on forgetting, sorry. Th-The head of the Jewish ghetto. 
Q: 
Cz
ernifsky
(ph)?  
A: 
Czerniaków
. 
Q: 
Czerniaków
. 
A: 
Adam Czerniaków
 was a good friend of m y father™s before the war. 
Adam 
Czerniaków
 was the s
e 
Œ in the Polish senate, and he was also a member of the city 
board, so my father knew him very well. But before my father met  
Leist
, 

Czerniaków
 worked with him for about nine months. And he was Œ everybody Œ 
the Germans were already furious with 
Leist
, b
ecause 
Leist
 treated 
Czerniaków 
well. He gave him a 
Mercedes
 and a driver. And he let him travel all over 
Warsaw
, 
and treated him like a human being. And of course, the Germans were absolutely 
livid, because he wasn™t carrying out 
Hitler™s 
policy towards Poles and towards 
Jews.But eight m
onths later, he was appoi nted the boss of ma Œ of the city hall. So-
called
 
stadtpräsident
.  
Q: Mm-hm, 
stadtpräsident
. 
A: So if he were Œ he became the city president, and my father was the ma yor be-

below him, and the whole Œ a-above each of the city depart ments, there was a 

German. And some of them were Œ most of them were pretty horri ble Nazis, but 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

since he had contacts with 
Hitler
 hi mself, he was able to overcome and save a lot of 
people in the ghetto, and outside of the ghetto, as long as he was Œ  before the ghett o 

became taken over completely by the 
SS
, which was
 
in 1940. From there on they Œ 
they closed up the ghet to, and neit her 
Leist
 nor my father could do. But f-for the Œ 

the first year, the city hall was able to take care of everybody in Œ in 
Warsaw
, 
inside and outside of the wall. 

Q: So that meant t hat your father di Œ report ed directly to 
Leist
.  
A: My father reported directly to 
Leist
, but my father reported direct l y to the pri me 
minister of 
Poland
. So he had a Œ 
th
is horrible jewel Œ job Œ pole Œ publicly, he was 
reporting to a German, but on a dai ly basi s, he was surrounded by three military Œ 

Polish underground mil itary intelligence agents, and was in c Œ daily contact with 

thecivilian and mil itary undergroundfa
cilities. So if he was able to gather 
intelligence, and pass it on, being an Œ hi mself an intelligence officer from the 
Soviet war, he knew how to do it, and he was able to maneuver it, and fortunatel y, 

a-as Œ as I said, 
Leist
 was the one who saved many lives, including m y father™s and 

m y own. He got me out  of the Œ from the train in 
Auschwitz
. He got m y father out 

of the Gestapo three times. 

Q: Did you meet hi m?

A: No, I never met hi m, I never met  him. After the war, he, together with other 
Nazis, were before the Polish courts, denazification courts, and the surviving 

members of the ghetto, and of my father™s administration defended 
Leist
, and t he 
other Nazis were hanged, but 
Leist 
was declared a Nazi, but not a cri minal, and he 

got a few years sentence, which he spent i n Polish jail after the war, for belonging 
to a cri minal organizati on, the Nazi  party. He wrote his memoirs, and my father 
wrote his memoirs, and 
Czesrniaków 
wrote his memoirs. So I™ve got all of these, 

and I™ve translated t hem i nto English. 

Q: Amazing. So, i t sounds that Œ from your telling, that he was li Œ not brutal, in a 

very brutal position. Is that Œ  

A: He was an end Œ 
it wa 
Œ he was referred to by the leaders of 
Warsaw
 as the 
prisoner of the city hall . Because he was a Œ 
he was a martyr, because he 
Œ he had to 
save as many lives as possible, and provide as decent living condit ions for Œ while Œ 
Czerniaków 
would come al most every week, to see m y father. He was allowed to 

leave the ghetto and report to m y father, and t o 
Leist
. And m y father, at first, was 

very suspicious of 
Leist
, because he was a Nazi, and all Nazis were horrible, 

inhuman, and yet, this guy went Œ after 
Czerniaków
 left, and was described the 
conditions in the ghetto, he turned to my father, he said, poor people Œ about th
e 

Jew Œ Poli sh Jews in the ghetto. And my father was taken aback. And there were a 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

number of things t hat he did during the five years. He knew about the underground 
arm y, he knew about the underground state, and he did not report it to the pole Œ to 

the German authorities. And the German authorities were suspicious of him. In 

1943 Œ for Œ no, ™44, after the attempt on 
Hitler™s
 life, 
Fisher
, who was 
Leist™s 
supervisor, was tol d to form a list of a hundred Nazis who was not loyal to 
Hitler
. 
And he called 
Leist
 and told hi m Œ gave him t he job to do it in 
Warsaw
, to find 
hundred Germans Œ and there were tens of thousands of Germans livi ng in 
Warsaw 
at the time, military and civilian, to form t hat list. And 
Leist 
said, well, I™m sorry, 
but I don™t know anybody who is disloyal. And 
Fisher
 said, why don™t you start 

with your own name? So Œ and during t he trial, after the war, 
Fisher 
tried to 
pretend, to save his life, that he was Œ allowed 
Leist
 to be the good guy. Like Œ 
which was not Œ which was a lie.  
Q: Amazing. Amazing. 
A: So that was Œ 

Q: I mean, but I also think Œ I mean, then 
Leist
, your father, and al l t hose people 
were living on a razor™s edge. 

A: The y were Œ well , 
L eist
 wa-was too. He was more afraid Œ 
Lei st
 
was more 

afraid of Gestapo than he was afraid of us, the underground arm y. And Œ and Œ and 

Œ and one Œ  he used to go hunting outside of 
Warsaw
 with 
Fisher
. And in 1943, the 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

Polish underground courts passed a sentence on 
Fisher
 for the Œ death, for the 
murder of the ghetto population, and the Polish population outside of the wall. And 

I was in the Œ at that ti me, in the unit, the commander unit, whi ch executed the 

sentences of the Supreme Court, of the underground courts, on Nazi criminals. And 

the sentence was passed upon 
Ludwig Fisher
. Well, they were comi ng back and wi 
Œ we put up machi ne guns along the road, and as the 
Mercedes
 were passing, we 
shot 
Fisher™s
 car. And unfortunately, these two guys changed cars, and 
Leist
 was 
the Œ in the 
Fisher™s 
car, and 
Leist
 just hit the floor, and when the car arrived in the 
city hall, he called my father downstairs and he said, look how I™ve been Œ for Œ for 

all the good things which I have done for the pole Œ 
Warsaw
 population, and they 
are trying to kill me. Why don™t you get i n touch with the underground and tell 

them that I am a Polish friend, a friend of Poles. He said Œ m y father said, of course, 
I will do it  tomorrow Œ right away, if I knew how to do it . I Œ I have no contact wi th 
the underground. But of course, he did contact the liaison officers, and the y notified 

m y father next da y, to t ell hi m that  the order was on 
Fisher
, and not for him, and 

for Œ never change the cars again. But it Œ 

Q: Did Œ did you ever Œ I mean, it sounds to me that all of these things you™re 

telling me, you learned after the war. 

A: 
Oh, yes.

Q: Oka y.  
A: I been Œ 

Q: Dur Œ yeah, at the time, when your father was in this extremely precarious 

position, did he ever talk at home about what was going on in t he office? 

A: No, no, no. No, he Œ he Œ as a matter of fact, that™s one of the reasons why he 
gave me away. I didn™t live with Œ  with Œ with my father and m y parents during the 
war.  

Q: Well, I want to Œ 
excuse m 
Œ because that™s exactly one of m y mai n questions. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: As I was reading your Œ your Œ your memoirs, or your Œ 
sort of like your 
Œ your 
diary that you wrot e afterwards. 

A: Right. 
Q: I found it very odd that at such a young age, you woul d not li ve at home. Tell me 
what happened. How did things progress? 

A: Well,I was 
Œ right after the war, the Germans closed the schools. I had a lot of 
free time, and from t he time I was 10 to 12, I and a friend of mine went out, and we 

would pick up the bombs which Œ small bombs which fell on the streets of 

Warsaw
, that didn™t explode. We™d take them to the garage of m y friend, and we 
would take out the powder out of it. And so my father was worried that Œ

Q: He knew this? 
A: Œ I was going to get killed. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And m y father was being arrested at home by the Gest apo. So he was worried 

that during the searches of the home, I would get him int o trouble, or he would get 
me into trouble. So he got in touch with m y pre-war scout master, by t he name of 
Ludwig Burger
(ph). He was also of Jewish background. I think he was a 

Protestant, buthe was 
Ludwig Burger
(ph). And I lived with hi m. And I wanted to 

join the underground army when I was 12, so 
Ludwig
 came to m y father for 
permission, because I was only 12 years old, and m y father said, of course, y-
you c 
Œ you can Œ you can join the arm y, so I was sworn into the Polish army at the age of 

12. 
Q: Unbelievable. 
A: And I lived wit h 
Ludwig
, which was only about three blocks away, so from to 

time I would drop in on the house, but basicall y I was Œ t here was no school, and 

Ludwig
 trained me as a soldier, and I was Œ 
Ludwig
formed the first unit of the 
Po
lish underground army out of the boy scouts in

. Most of them were 
older than I, I was t he youngest one. And at first I was just the runner, I was running 

around wit h secret cont acts, to the ghetto and t-to other places in 
Warsaw
. But later

on I be
came a f 
Œ at the age of 13, a year later, I became a regular soldier, and I was 
trained in arms, and we had maneuvers outside of the cit y, and were trained as a 

regul Œ in order to prepare us for to Œ to fight.  

Q: So, did you fa Œ was your father Œ 
did yo
u t ell him before you went awa y, that 
you and your friend were collecting these unexploded bombs? 
A: Oh, he knew Œ he heard about it, because my f Œ m y friend l ost his leg. I wasn™t 
there, but he was supposed to wait for me, but he got some nit Œ nitrogly- glycerin, 
and it exploded and the whole garage went up, and he lost  a whol e leg. So m y father 
knew that I was Œ t he y were also trying out making bombs, and Œ and Œ and trying 

them out i n the parks, and so we Œ he was a-afraid that I was going to get killed, and 

he had no ti me for the family. He was Œ he worked day and night at t he city hall. 

Just drop i n for food once in a while. And so he didn™t have Œ th-t here was no man 
to take care of the litt le boy. And he felt that 
Ludwig Burger
(ph) would be an 
excell
ent person to take hold of me. 
Q: And di d your mother have anything to sa y about it?  

A: My mother didn™t know anything about it. My mother was very upset after the 

war, when t he book came out, that he didn™t Œ she didn™t know anythi ng about it.

A: Well, because they were Œ the y were hiding. They were hiding, so m y father 
really handed me over t o a Jewish family, basically. Only, as I sai d, the religion had 

no part in it. They were extremely patriotic, int egrated Polish intellectuals, and th-

years old at ti me. I was 13.  

Q: But here is m y question. It™s Œ it™s not  so much that they were integrated, and not 

Œ religion didn™t pl a y a part, it is, wouldn™t they have been known by the Gestapo, 

and why Œ how is it that the y could hide in plain sight in Œ in 
W-Warsaw
. 
A: Well,it all 
Œ it Œ well, in al most every house in 
)
 that I know of, I mean, 
certainly every other house, had a Jewish famil y being hidden, i ncluding our own 

house. My mother hid about nine members of the Jewish family between our house, 

and we Œ also, later on we had a house in t he country. And she took care of Œ saved 

a number of members of Œ Jews who were, you know, integrated, and were not 

Polish speaking, and who could survive in Œ i n Œ in hiding. 

Q: I see. And it™s a kind of crass wa y to put it, but did 
Ludwig
 look Jewish?

A: Yes, very much so. Just look at the picture. 
Q: Oka y. So that meant that if he was walking down the street, he could have been 

picked up. 

A: Well, he was six feet four inches tall, he was extremely handsome, and he was 

very self-confident. He was a real leader, and bordering on the arrogant, you know. 
So I don™t think t he y Œ they would dared hi m, until the y found out that the y were 
looking for hi m. And this is how I got caught, and Œ and Œ 
an
d 
Steffa
(ph) were 
arrested. 

Q: We™ll come to that. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But Œ because I want to do this a little bit more chronologically Œ  

A: The y were looking for us. The y were looki ng for 
Ludwig
. 
Q: Oka y. But it™s Œ it™s just so surprising to me, to hear of somebody who woul d be 

living openly, more or less, on the Aryan side, and he cou
ld
 Œ considered himself a 
Protestant, but that doesn™t matter if the Germans are in control.  

A: Exactly. But th- th Œ he was a great hero i n this part of 
Warsaw
. He was known 
by ev e
rybody and loved by everybody, and nobody cared what he was Œ he had t he 
Jewish grandfather, or Œ or the grandmother, or whatever it was, you know, it was 

uni mportant. He was Œ

Q: Did he have false papers? 
A: Sorry? 

Q: Did he have false papers? Did he have false papers? Did he have real papers that 

said I am Œ 

A: Oh, I am sure Œ I am sure he had false papers. They di Œ all had false papers. All 
three of them had false papers, in case of being ta Œ caught. But 
Burg er
(ph) could 
be a Jewish Œ a German name, as well as Jewi sh. 
Q: Of course. 

A: So, you know, it Œ I don™t know what kind of papers. Maybe he had the

papers, for all I know.

A: I Œ 
I me 
Œ he Œ t he Œ that was height of conspiracy, and nobody was supposed to

that lived i n the Œ i n that apart ment , and 
Ludwig
 gave me a job to try t o test hi m 
whether he was not going to report 
Ludwig
 to the police, whether it was for his 
activities in the underground, or for being of Jewish background, I couldn™t Œ I

didn™t know at the time. But the point was that I was able to convi nce hi m to do 
that, and 
L udwig
 had him shot, as I Œ 
they di 
Œ  
Q: So what was the tes
t?
 
A: Œ he was Œ he was head of the c Œ the Œ t he company of 150 soldiers, and at that 

time the captain had the right of making a decision like that, legally, of a Œ 
a 
suspect 
was enough to be killed, because he could bri ng so many deaths, if he was caught 
by the Germans. 

Q: So tell me, what was the test t hat you had Œ that you had for him? 

A: Well, I talked hi m i nto going t o the police and Œ and Œ and Œ and selling 
Ludwig
 

for mone y. And it wasn™t very difficult, he already had that idea, so I went and 

reported to 
Ludwig
, and 
Ludwig
 had him shot . 
Q: Wow.
 
A: But you know, agai n, that was something t hat was Œ I was 12 years old at the 
time, and I Œ I Œ I Œ  I onl y found out later that he was killed, and where he was 

killed, by Œ by our execution squad. And I felt, of course, responsi ble for it. 

Q: So, you ma ybe have to repeat it a little bit, but tell me what your life was like 

with 
Ludwig
, in this new place. You had t he t wo

Q: Oka y. 
A: And she Œ she got hi m after the war, after 
Ludwig
 was killed, but at that ti me, he 
was live Œ for whatever reason, he was livi ng with the father, and 
Alexa ndra
(ph) 
So ko l
(ph) was the head of the international couriers secti on, women™s courier, and 
they were also responsi ble for Œ also attacks on German cri minals. 
S-Steffa
(ph), 
who was t he love of 
Ludwig™s
, and she was kind of his secretary, and did all of the 

secretarial work for hi m, and did the h-
home caring 
Œ help Œ cooking, and taking 
care of the house. 

Q: So, she was hi s girlfriend? 

A: Sorry? 
Q: She was his girlfriend? 
A: She was his girlfriend, right. 

Q: Yeah. And in this household you first joined the underground, and then at age 

13, you were accepted into the underground arm y? 

A: No, I was Œ I™d Œ I™d Œ I Œ I Œ I was the Œ I had joined them at the age of 11, and 
in the same year, later t hat year, when I was 12, when I was sworn into the 

underground arm y, 1941.

Q: Which means you don™t really have a childhood. Your childhood ended then. 
A: Yes, it did. Well, everybody had to grow up, but Œ but basical ly we were brought 

up, the Germans made it very clear, that it was question of ti me, t hat t hey were 

going to ki ll us all . So i t wasn™t a question of whether we™re gonna live or die, only 

when. And that made a whole mental attit ude different. This is why we rose up in 
1944, that™s how all our brothers in Œ in the 
Warsaw
 ghetto rose in 1943
, because 
they preferred Œ we preferred to die with our arms in hands, than going to the gas 
chambers. And it was a  question of age. Both i nside the ghetto, and outside of the 

ghetto, the adults, t he priests, the rabbis, would tell the ki ds not t o sti r things up, not 

to form in a resistance, not to resist, because that would make things worse. Well, 

we knew better. We knew that we had to defend ourselves, we had to defend our 

families. And Œ and it fon Œ it proved that the young people were right, and when I 
meet now with American kids in high schools, I often am on their side, because 
when youare young, youarehonest, you have 
Œ you are not spoiled, you Œ you™ve 
got certain i nborn morals, and Œ and you know better than the parents, who are 

more scared. 

Q: Well, the y don™t  want their chil dren to die. 

A: Well, they don™t  want the children to die, exactly, but they Œ they don™t realize 

that you have to fight t o save yourself.

Q: Well, you know that  Œ in one wa y, when I was looking through your memoir, 
you™re answering another question that I had, because I had Œ I see t hese pictures of 

children in uniforms, with guns, you know, and the y clearly aren™t even teenage 

boys yet. They™re in their Œ they™re in that age of 10 to 13. And it just Œ it boggles 

the mind, 
t hat a teenage boy, who™s 17 or 18, could be part of this is already 
something you can Œ they™re on thei r wa y to manhood. 

A: Yeah, but it™s happening all over the world. Since I™ve, as an international 

architect, I™ve worked i n 30 countries. I™ve worked in Arab countri es, I™ve been in 

Israel
 many ti mes, and I realize that  in places which are dangerous, t he kids grow 

up very fast, and there are many children soldi ers Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ unfortunately, still today. 
Q: It™s true.  
A: So it™s Œ it™s Œ  it™s true in 
Afghanistan
, and in Œ in 
Iraq
, in Œ in 
Jordan
, and in Œ 
and I Œ I Œ I™m sure the I-Israeli kids are Œ are brought up in Œ in Œ in the same spirit 
of defending their homeland. So it Œ it Œ i t™s not somethi ng that you recommend, but 

when the Germans closed schools, and the onl y school was the military sc Œ 
career, 

you grew up fast, and you grew up in a different wa y. And you mature faster. I

30. Well, he is what I was at 13. He™s so far be-be yond, because of t he easy life, no 
challenges, and th-the parents and the schools don™t expect Œ don™t provide enough 

challenges to these kids. I meet a lot with the boy scouts, the girl scouts, the high 

school, the middle school kids, and I Œ I Œ I make friends with them immediately, 

and the y Œ because I become that age, back, when I talk about my experiences. And 
I Œ I Œ I Œ I™m Œ I™ve great respect for them, an-and some Œ and that™s some 
wonderful young peopl e. When I Œ when I hear about the Œ the Œ the education 

system being bad, there are alwa ys bad student s and good students, but the good 

students are fantastic. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Great kids. 

Q: Amazing. Tell me Œ let™s go back to how things Œ what were some of the other 
activities youtook part w
ith under 
Ludwig™s
, I suppose guidance, or Œ or direction, 
and so on?  
A: Well, first of all, he trained me t-to prepare me for arrest  by the Gestapo Œ  

Q: And how do you do that? 

A: Œ 
and m y torture.Sorry?
 
Q: How do you do that ? How do you get t rained for that? 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

A: Well, he did two thi ngs. He taught me how to fight when you don™t have a gun. 
Fight with your teeth, how do kill a person with a knife, or with your hands, and 

with your teeth. That™s how he died. He also prepared me how I should answer 

under torture, about hi m, because he knew perfectl y well that I woul d be the nat ural 

one that the Gestapo would want t o find hi m, through me. So he said, just sa y to the 
Gestapo that you hated me. That I was a tyrant. I wouldn™t let you have sex with 
girls. I wouldn™t let you have the freedom t hat  you wanted to do, that you really 

hated me, and that you will collaborate wit h them in trying to find me. And also, 

don™t admit that you know any German, so you™ll have a translator. So he prepare 

me very wel l for it, and it was very useful when I was taken to the torture chambers.  

Q: Tell me Œ 
tell me some oftheactivities that you took partin. You said you were 

part of the commando unit that was Œ 
A: Well, this was later. This was after Œ after 
Ludwig
 died. 
Q: I see. 
A: Th-Th-This was part of the Œ his unit became the divi sion which was supporting 

the general headquart ers of the Polish underground army, called 
Baszta
, the tower. 
But after I was arrest ed, and the y were following me, trying to find 
Ludwig
, I had 
to leave, because I was burned. And I joined the commandoes in order to be able t o

return the Œ be able t o kill some Germans right awa y. I couldn™t wait for the 
uprising. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But during Œ while I lived with 
Ludwig
, I was Œ at first I was carrying secret 

mess
ages, and at one ti me he took me to the ghetto, which was an experience. I Œ I 
used to go to visit  m y girlfriend in the ghetto, but this was when the streetcar woul d 

still be allowed to go. The Œ it wasn™t allowed to stop inside the ghett o, but it went 

from one gate to the ot her, and I would jump off, see 
Zula
(ph), and t hen jump back 
on the Œ on this Œ on the streetcar, which was under the police guard. 

Q: Was thi s when the ghetto was still part of Œ under 
Leist™s
 control, rather than the 

SS
? 

A: No, no, no, no, no. No, 
Leist
 only had it a few months, it was still in the 
construction stages. 
Q: I see. 

A: He only had it about  eight months, six or eight months. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It was t he Œ the planning stages, rather than the Œ even construction. No, no, 

before the
y 
Œ the y had Œ eventual t he y had to redirect the streetcars around the wall.

But at first, the y went right straight through the Œ through Œ through t he ghetto, 
because it was an integral part of the downtown. 

Q: So, 
Zula
(ph) and Œ 
[brea k]
 
Q: Oka y, t his is a conti nuation of our interview with Mr. 
Julian Kulski
. We were 

talking about you visiting 
Zula
(ph) in the ghetto. So that ax Œ answers another 
question that I had, which was, what happened to 
Zula
(ph). She was then forced, 
with her mother, to enter the ghetto. 

A: After the 1943 
Warsaw
 uprising, I believe she was in the bunker with 
Annie 
Levitch
(ph) and the y committed suicide i n the last da ys of the uprising. But I have 

no proof of it, it™s just m y conjecture, knowing her and her spirit, that she was i n the 

underground, inside the wall, the wa y I was in the underground outside the wall. 

But in 1942, 
Ludwig
 took me for a two da y visit into the ghetto, and he told me that 
he was taking me so that if he got killed there, I would be able to take out the 
information from inside the ghetto. And I was wondering at the ti me, if he was 

killed, why wouldn™t I be killed, but I didn™t say anything
.Took the order.
 
So we 
went in, and we went t hrough a secret underground passage through one of the 

buildings, andwe met som
e Poli sh Jewi sh underground members, who brought  us 
some dirty clothes, because we would be recognized right  away i n our outfits from

the outside, so we put t he rags on. And wi th Œ going to a place where 
Ludwig
 was 
meeting the Œ some leaders of the Jewish underground Œ 
Q: What di d you see when you enter Œ when you emerged inside Œ  

A: Well, it was suddenly hell. There were dead people on t he sidewalks, children. 

And then I saw a German hunting, shooti ng innocent people on the st reet, a 
pregnant woman being kicked. It was just unbelievable. We had to hi Œ when he 
was shooting, we had to hide in a doorwa y of a Œ of an apartment bui lding. And 

then we got  there, and 
Ludwig
 was asked to transmit through the underground 
government  to 
Londo n
, the information what was happening to 
Warsaw
 Jews. 
Q: What wa Œ oka y, what kind of information Œ 

A: Well 
Œ 
Q: Œ and what kind of requests were made? 
A: Œ well, by that t ime, it was already tr-trai nloads being taken to the gas chambers, 
and everybody knew what Œ m y father told 
Czerniaków
 what was happening, and 
Czerniaków
 committed suicide. But it Œ the Œ  the wa Œ the west didn™t do anything 
to help, and it was Œ there were desperate attempts. The y asked t o Œ t he west to 

inform Germans that for every Polish Jewi sh li fe, there would be a German killed. 

Prisoners of war, and other German citizens. And the y realized that i t was an 

unrealistic request, but it was a desperate move to Œ to Œ 
tohelp. They askedto have

the trains bombed on the wa y to 
Majdanek
, to 
Auschwitz
. And also, they asked us 
for arm Œ for informati on how to build bunkers, for concrete, and reinforced steel, 
so they could prepare for the uprising, and for arms. I know that m y own company 

submitted 50 
Œ sold, or gave 50 guns to the Jewish fighters. And then, later on, I 
was in the 
Warsaw
 fire brigade, and the Germans respected the Polish firemen, 
because the y needed it, during the allied bombing of 
Warsaw
, the Polish firemen 
were very important , and the Poli sh blu Œ blue police, some of them were 

[indecipherable]
, some of them were members of the underground. So they 

couldn™t Œ you couldn™t depend on the Œ but the Œ the Œ the Œ the firemen were under 
Œ according to German law, the pol ice and the fire departments went under the 

police, under the Gestapo, under t he 
SS
.  So
 the Œ the guy who destroyed the ghet to 
and murdered innocent  Œ destroyed the whole ghetto and the people i nside, was 
Stroop
,
 
Jürg en Stro op
. And he was responsi ble for the Polish fire department. 
And once a year there would be a parade of al l the f-fire trucks, and firemen on it in 
the, you know, firefighting uniforms, before him. And he was very proud of the 

Polish firemen. He didn™t know t hat 80 percent of us were members of the 

underground arm y.

Q: So, when you were i n the ghett o, there was the request of a life for a life Œ when 
you were in the ghetto, there was this request of a life for a life, because so many 

Jews were being kil led indiscri minately.  

A: Right, right. 

Q: There was a request  for information on how to build bunkers. 
A: Bunkers, and for ar
ms.
 
Q: And for arms. 
A: Right. 

Q: And you were able t o supply t hem with 50 Œ what was it again? 
A: Fifty pistols. 

Q: Fifty pistols. And that was later. 

A: And submach Œ  
yeah .
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: That was later on. 

Q: That was later. 

A: And th Œ we™re able to use the fire depart ment trucks, because the Germans 

would l Œ of course, if there was a fire in the ghetto, the y would let us in through the 

Œ through Œ through, and then we could drop the informat ion, and come out. 

Q: So was this the only Œ 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski  
 
September 2 5

69
 
A: As a matter of f act, the y Œ when I was in Œ i-in Œ in full fireman™s uniform wi th 
m y helmet,and my 
Œ I was allowed to go thr Œ walk thro Œ in the city through the 
night, after the police hour. 

Q: So, after curfew. 

A: And when we run into German patrols, 
W ehrma cht
 patrols, t he y would salute 
us, we would salute them. So the y thought Œ it was a very good cover for the Œ for Œ 

for us to carry arms and Œ and Œ and attack Germans. 

Q: Was thi s the only time, after the ghetto was sealed off, that you were in the 

ghetto, or did you go in to deliver those 50 pistols? 

A: No, no, I had nothing to do with that. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: No, th-th Œ as I said, the first time, I would just go to see 
Zula
(ph).  
Q: Oka y, and so I want to go back to this again. When I asked earlier, not what 

happened to her at t he end, but how is it that she had to go to the ghet to when she 

was half and half Œ 

A: Well, because the y were considered Œ everybody was considered Jewish up to 

the third generation. If you had one grandfather who was Jewish, you were Jewish

as far as the Germans were concerned. That™s how I was sa ying, that if the Germans 
knew that my father™s grandmother was Jewish, he would have been considered Jew 

by the Nazis. 

Q: I see. And so, for 
Zula
(ph), and her mother, of course, who was Jewish, it™s a Œ 
it™s a given.  
A: Right, right. 
Q: But for Œ and t his is where the juxtaposi tion for me sounded so confusing; that 

she is forced, but 
Ludwig
 isn™t. 
A: Well 
Œ 
Q: Do you see what I™m saying? She cannot have a choice of living outside Œ this is 

someone who doesn™t know the war, who doesn™t know the situation. And why I 

was ask Œ 
A: Well, th-th Œ there were over, I would say, between hundred, and 140,000 Jews 
in 
Warsaw
 during Œ that survived. Either being hidden, or Œ 
Q: Outside the ghetto. 

A: Œ outsi de the ghet Œ 
outsidethe ghetto, right.
 
Q: Outside the ghetto, oka y. 

A: I mean, t h-th Œ the reason all three of them Œ
 
Ludwig
 was killed on the street, in 
a fight with an 
SS
 
man , 
Steffa
(ph) ended up in 
Auschwitz
 after we were arrested.

And 
Ola
(ph) committed suicide after she was arrested in t he church with false 
papers and arms, and Œ and Œ and was tortured, and committed sui cide, with a 

suicide pill  Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ cause we all had t hem, in case we couldn™t stand the pain any m ore, we could 
commit suicide. I had i t in my ring. 
Q: You wore a ring? 

A: Yeah, I had a sil ver ring that Œ empty i nside, and I had a c yanide capsule in it. 

When I was arrested, when I was 13. 

Q: Oka y. I think we™ll break now, and we™ll talk about all  of these incidents aft Œ 
[brea k]
 
Q: This is a continuation with our interview at the Holocaust Museum with Mr. 
Julian K ulski
. And before the break, we were talking about the guns, and the Œ t he 
armaments that were brought in by the fire bri gade, to the ghetto. But  you were not 

involved i n that. And from what I understand, it was the one and only time you 

were in the ghetto after the wall was secure Œ t hat is, people could not go in. Did 

you ever go there again? 

A: Not after the visit in ™42 with 
Ludwig Burger
(ph). 
Q: Oka y.

A: That was the last ti me. 
Q: That was the last ti me. 

A: Last ti me. 

Q: What di d wa Œ how did things proceed for you, after you left? What kind of 

activities were you involved in? 
A: Well, I was invol Œ continued training, mili tary training, maneuvers outside of 
the city, learning about  new arms, explosi ves. But soon after, in 1943, in the middle 

of the summer, there was a wedding of two Polish underground officers, in one of 

the downtown churches. And there were about a hundred underground officers 

attending it , which is against all t he rules of conspirac y, which the y broke. And 

somehow the Germans learned about it, and at the height of the marriage ceremony, 

the 
SS 
entered the church, and arrested 89 people, and among them was 
Ola
(ph) 
So lku
l
(ph), with whom I lived, with 
Steffa
(ph), and 
Ludwig
. And she had false 
papers, German papers under 
Evee
(ph)
 Kel ler
(ph), and guns. So, as soon as we 
found out that she was arrested, 
L udwig
 left the apart ment  and he told Œ 
send me 
home to m y parent s, so only 
Steffa
(ph) and 
Marek
(ph), and the grandmother were 
left. But about 10 da ys, two weeks later, we found out through our underground 
sources that 
Ola
(ph) was tortured so badly that she committed suicide, and was Œ 

died, rather t han tell the stories. So I felt I was safe, and in the morning I went back

to the apartment. 
Ludwig
 stayed awa y, fortunately. Well, in the afternoon, I was in 
the living room, and I heard banging on the front door, and 
Steffa
(ph) said, who is 
it? And I heard, Gestapo, open the door, or I will shoot t hrough. And I was on the 

first floor, and there was a balcony, and I was going to jump int o the park, a publ ic 

park, and escape. So I opened the doors, the French doors, and I look behind me, 
and the Gestapo man already had a machine gun pointed at me, and said 
[indec
ipherable]
. So I had to surrender. He Œ I was arrested on the spot. The y Œ 
th
-
they check on the apartment. The little boy was playing over the secret safe where 

the arms were kept. And so the y t ook me and 
Steffa
(ph), and took me downstairs, 
and there were 
open, bi g 
Mercedes 
cars, three of them, and they put Œ put us in, and 
took us to the 
Pawiak
 prison.  
Q: What™s t he 
Pawiak 
prison? 
A: 
Pawiak
 prison was an old so Œ  Russian pri son in the center of 
Warsaw
, a huge Œ 
built to take care of Pol ish par Œ freedom fight ers of the 19
th
 centu
ry. The 
Œ the Œ 
this was a huge, huge Œ so huge prison. And th Œ there were double gate, and the 
cars went through the first gate, they closed the gate behind, and suddenly there 

were all kinds of horrible German Shepherds t hat were tryi ng to at tack us, growling, 

and the y were all fed on Œ on human flesh, on the prisoners™ flesh, that the y were 

just Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I will never forget the sight  of these dogs Œ and I l ove dogs, but

these were j ust wil d ani mal s, horri ble. And then finall y the y opened the other gate, 
took us in, and there they put us on one si de of the room; 
the man
, on the other side 
the women, and I was standing, my face to the wall. And I tried to make contact 

with 
Steffa
(ph) across the room, I turned my head, and one of the Germans hit me 
on the wall, and my nose started bleeding. So that was di Œ di Œ t he first ti me I knew 
that I was Œ  lost m y freedom. Then they took me, and took everything away from 
me, and shaved m y head. And bei ng a 13 year old, all I was worried about is, how 

am I going to go on dat es? You know, instead of worrying about m y l ife, I was 

worried about m y hair. It just shows the mentalit y of a 13 year old. Then I was 

thrown into a cell, which was supposed to be for one person, and there were six of 

us 
al
together. It was jammed, and at night we had to sleep like sardines across the 
room. In order to turn over, we had to all do it at the same ti me, because we just 
stuck, wall to wall. And then, in the middle of the night, you heard the executions 
squads in t h Œ in t he outside, and t he cries of the people being shot, and tortured. 

Th-There were all ki nd Œ poor food, hardly any food. We™re allowed to the 

bathroom once a da y onl y, for five minutes. So there was a bucket of uh Œ in the 

corner, smel ly. It was horrible. So, at Œ at Œ  

Q: Were you the youngest there, do you think?

A: I was the Œ definitel y t he youngest one. And for all the strange thi ngs, I was 
selected by the adults t o be the one to be representative, because every morning the 

door opened, and I had to report, in German, that six prisoners, all  here, everything 

in order. I was very short, and then I had the door slammed in my face. But, was the 

same in Œ in Œ in Œ in a prisoner of war camp l ater. I don™t know why, being the 
youngest, they had the greatest faith in me, that I would be honest , about food, 
cutting bread, because Œ 

Q: The prisoners themselves had selected you Œ 

A: The prisoners selected me, right , right. 

Q: Did you speak German? 

A: Very little, very little. Oh, I had this German nanny, but I didn™t want to learn 

German, I hated her. B ut that was u Œ turned useful. I understood more then, than I 
could speak. And I knew a few words. I knew enough to sa y that. And then, one 
day, I was taken for Œ t o the Gestapo headquarters for examinations, for torture, and 

we were in a prison van, and I was with 
Steffa
(ph), and we were able to Œ finally to 
agree on the same st ory, so that each one of us would tell the same story about 

Ludwig
, and everything else. And that was the last ti me I saw her. From the Œ t here, 
she was sent to 
Auschwitz
, where she survived the war, but she didn™t know that 

Ludwig
 was killed on the streets a few weeks later. So when she would Œ got to

Poland
, i t was a shock, because the first thi ng she was looking forward to, was to 
s
ee 
Ludwig
, whom she la Œ was crazy about . And when she found out he was dead, 
she died soon after, a few years later. 

Q: Really? 

A: But I was taken, and put into a cage, which we Œ we call ed the streetcars, 
because it was a narrow room wi th about 16 so-
cal
led chairs, very uncomfortable, 
wooden bench. And we had to sit back to the main corridor, where the Gestapo men 
walked back and forth. And this was the beginning of the torture, because at the end 

of the corridor were t he torture chambers, and we could he ar the cri es of the 

prisoners being tortured. And then, the y would put these people into the same room 

with us. Women without breasts, with the eyes cut out, with the fingers pulled out. 

You know, kind of inhuman. So you sat there for about 48 hours, wit hout food, 
without all  these thing, and then the German would pla yi ng Œ they had the radio, 
and the y were pla yi ng the German tunes, and t hey were cooking st eaks. So that the 

Œ this was all Œ you had all the senses, whi ch were Œ were starved, after two weeks 

in the prison, and t hen t wo da ys with no food. And the music, the cries of the being 

tortured, the Œ a-a-and t he Œ and the smell of the food, and the music were Œ that 

completely wrecked you, so by the ti me you Œ I was taken upstairs int o one of the 

examination rooms. They asked me if I speak German, I said no, I di dn™t know a

word, so they had t o have a translat or. That was one thing that 
Ludwig  
prepared 
me, so that gave me a t ime to come out with a answer, a lie, while the translator was 

translating it. My father did the same thing, when he was arrested. And the y Œ first, 

they wanted to know my relationship with 
Ludwig
, so I Œ I Œ I Œ I mentioned all the 
things, and I told them that I want to help t hem find him, because I hated him. And 
so they said, well, will you join us? I said, of course, anything to Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ to 
find him. And then they gave me a book full of pictures of freedom fighters, a ba Œ 
very thick book, and made me look at each picture, and Œ to see if I recognized 

anybody. And I recognized one, and I said Œ and he said, who is it, where do you 

get it? I said, well, he™s in m y cell in 
Pawiak
 prison. When the y knew I was making 

fun of them, I got reall y hit behind the head with the whip. 

Q: Was he in your cell? 
A:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
Q: And, excuse me, for those of us who don™t know, why would that be making 
fun? If you were a Œ 
a 
Œ you know, recognize this person Œ 
A: Well, because the y Œ they Œ 
the y th 
Œ t he y felt that I wasn™t leading them to Œ to 
Œ to the underground, you know, t hat Œ 

Q: It™s true.  

A: Œ and I didn™t, I didn™t. I just Œ

Q: It™s true.  
A: Œ picked out somebody that I knew, but I did Œ there was a pict ure of 
Ola
(ph), 

there was a picture of 
Ludwig
, and there were a picture of other members of Œ that I 
knew, that I didn™t sa y anyt hing. The Œ they Œ then the y started beating me. Then 

after beating, the y again started talking me int o it, that the y fight Œ just lead them to 
Ludwig
, I will Œ I™ll Œ I™ll Œ
 
I can join the Gestapo, and I will be well  off, and I™m 
so young, it™s a pi ty, and so it was bad guy and good guy routine. Then the y made 
me look through t he secret files, to see if I find something, that I would stop and be 

interested. Which is amazing, because I was being ab Œ able to see all of the Polish 

and Jewish underground fighting organization they had the file Œ files on. But then 

towards the evening after the Œ all t his beati ng and Œ and Œ  and starvat ion and 

torture, the y asked 
me where 
Ludwig
 worked. I said, wel l, he worked as a Œ taking 
care of some gardens. So he Œ the y put Œ  took me to a map of the cit y, and they saw 
a building in the middle of the gardens, and they sa ys, what is it? I said, well, it™s 

just a garden shed. But actually, we Œ 
Ludwig
 had a German car there, and some 
arms. So t he y piled me up into the car, it was an evening. There were again two 

Mercedes
, open cars, with machi ne guns on t he sides. And I remember we went  
through the center of 
Warsaw
, it was a beautiful, sunny da y. And I was bald, I was 
starving, and I coul d see the human be Œ you know, the normal life. I almost felt

like cr-crying. And there were two wa ys to the garden, one was from the bottom, 
from the 
Vi stula
, and t he one from the top. And I knew t hat if we came from the 

top there was a gate, then whoever was there could escape. So we came up from the 

top, and sure enough, the German car said 
p-o -l
, 
poli
zei
 on the Œ on t he Œ they 
recognized right awa y as a Gestapo car. And by the time we got down 
[indecipherable]
 escaped. 
Ludwig
 wasn™t there, but fortunately, he took everyt hing 
out of that building before that. 
Q: Beforehand. 

A: So then the y took me back, and they had one more day of tortures, and then the y 

send me back to Œ back to 
Pawiak
 prison. And then, about two and a half weeks, 

three weeks later, the y were calling out names, those to be executed, t hose to be 

sent to 
Auschwitz
, and I was on t he list to the 
Auschwitz
, so Œ 
Q: Did people know at that point what 
Auschwitz
 was? 

A: Oh, perfectly wel l. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Everybody knew what 
Auschwitz
 was, it was a frightening name 

[indecipherable]
. M
y 
Uncle 
Norbert
 was murdered there i n the first year, in 1940.  
Q: Well, how did he get arrested? What happened with him?

A: Well, they arrested all the Poli sh leaders of Œ the university professors, and Œ and 
leaders of parties, and he was the l eader of the Polish Socialist party. So he was a 

public figure, and Œ 

Q: What was his last name? 

A: Œ and he was arrested th-the same time as m y father. And Œ 
Q: I see. What was he Œ 
Norbert™s 
last name? 
A: Sorry Œ 
Barl
icki
. 
Q: 
Barli
cki
, oka y. 
A: 
Barli
cki
, 
Norbert Barl
i
cki
. And my father was also arrested, and m y father was 
arrested for a different reason. During the siege of 
Warsaw
 in 1939, there was an 
American photo report er by the name of 
Julien Bryan
, who came voluntarily three 
days after the siege, and was taking pictures, movies. Most of these movies are right 
now in thi s museum. They were bought by Holocaust Museum, and restored. And 
m y father took him around 
Warsaw
, taking pictures. Well, a year later, somehow 
the ﬁ
Life
ﬂ magazine, which 
Julien Bryan™s 
pictures occurred, got to the city hall, 
and his secretary gave them a copy of this ﬁ
Life
ﬂ magazine. He 
Œ  
Q: Your father. 

A: My father brought it home and hid in the Œ in the laundry closet, which during 

the next Gestapo search, the y found the Œ 
the ﬁ
Life
ﬂ magazine,
 and t hey were

convinced that my father was a American spy. So this ti me it was extremely serious, 
not only that Œ that he mi ght be a member of the Polish underground government , 

which he was, but t hat he was an American spy. So he was taken to 
Pawiak
, and 

thrown together wi th Uncle 
Norbert
. So the y spent about two days in prison 

together, saying goodbye, and that was the last ti me my father saw 
Norbert
. 
Norbert
 went to 
Auschwitz
. He helped organize an underground there, and then he 
was killed there. But my father was released after Œ oh, my father was taken to a 

torture chamber too, and told to take all hi s clothes. He knew that he was going to 

be beaten to death. And he was just in the process of taking off his pants, as a senior 

Gestapo man passed through, and recognized m y father. It was the same man that 

arrested my father in 1939. So he knew t hat my father was the ma yor of 
Warsaw
, 
and he said to the guys there, don™t beat hi m yet, wait. And m y father knew that if Œ 
once they beat you up 
[indeciphera ble]
 t he y will never let you go Œ be alive, 
because you were a-
at  
Œ they coul dn™t let you out on Œ on the streets i n condition 
like that. They didn't want people to know what the y were doing. So that saved his 
life, this ti me. 

Q: So the Œ the Œ the Gestapo who said del a y, what made t he dela y into, don™t beat 

hi m at all? 

A: Well, I guess he recog Œ realized that he was the ma yor of 
Warsaw
.

Q: Oka y. 
A: And the y let hi m go. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: Because he was Œ he was too important for the Germans. The Germans didn™t 

have a way of running the city, and so m y father had this unfortunate situation, t hat 
he did Œ he 
[indeci phera ble]
 his best in a terrible situation, being a Œ 
a 
Œ 
endangered by the Gestapo, and by the 
SS
, and also by the communist underground, 
who Œ who Œ which didn™t know Œ they threw a bomb at his car while he was going 
to the city hall one day. And the under Œ Polish underground had to notify the 

communist underground that m y father was a member of the underground 

government , so to desist. But after that m y father stopped using t he car, and started 

driving in a 
*
, in a ca Œ in a horse drawn vehicle to show that he had nothi ng 
to be afraid of. 

Q: Mm-hm. So let™s go back to your imprisonment. So t here you are, and you™re on 

the list to go to 
Auschwitz
. What happens? 

A: Well, the Œ evidently somebody in the city hall went over to 
Leist
, and told them 

that the ma yor™s son was being sent to 
Auschwitz
. And m y father refused to go and 

ask for Œ for Œ for m y li fe, because he felt that if he started asking for favors from 

the Germans, he would really be a collaborat or, and he would have to pay Œ pa y the

price for it. But somebody, one of his directors, went to 
Leist
, and 
Leist
 must have 
gotten in t ouch wit h 
Berlin
, and 
B erlin
 ordered th-the Gestapo in 
Warsaw 
to let 
me go.
 
Q: Wow.
 

A: But when the Œ when I was bei ng released, I was sent up to the chi ef Gestapo 
man, who was Colonel 
Hann
(ph), who was sitting be-behind a bi g desk, in a big 
room, up on the same building where the torture chambers were. And he was under 
huge painting of 
Hitler
. Enormous painti ng, f-full Œ full wall size. And there was 
m y father and 
Leist
 and m y father™s translator, sitting back. I couldn™t sa y hello to 
them. The y didn™t t urn around. But I got a lect ure from the Major 
Hahn
(ph), he 
said, I Œ I know you are a member of the underground. You were caught with Œ red-

handed, but  General
 Leist
 says that you are onl y 14 years old, so we let you go. But 
next ti me we catch you, the devil himself is not going to save you. 
Q: Wow.
 

A: So then I was released, but the y followed me everywhere I went i n 
Warsaw
, 
because the y thought t hat I would lead them to 
Ludwig
. So Œ 
Q: Wa 
Œ di d you go home to your parents? Ha Œ wi Œ  
A: I went t o Œ to Œ  to my parents, right, to m y parents™ house, but they t hought t hat I 

would lead them to Œ t o 
Ludwig
. So the y send me to the country place outside of

Warsaw
, where I spend about a month, and 
Ludwig
 came and visited us, and that 
was the last  ti me I saw him. 
Q: And what was t his country place called? 

A: 
Banyoha
(ph).  

Q: 
Banyoha
(ph).  
A: Which i s about an hour and a half by narrow gauge railroad 
[phone ringing]
 
Q: Let™s just break for a second. 
[brea k] 
So wi Œ you were sent to 
Banyo ha
(ph). 
Now, did your mother know of aw Œ any of these things that were happening to 
you?
 
A: Well, 
she knew that I was in pri son, of course. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And I di Œ she saw me afterwards. There is a picture in the book of my mother™s 
sister, younger sister 
Zosia
(ph) who hid t he 
Katz
 family, and 
Ludwig
, supposedly 
with a new haircut, but he was six feet four, so the change in outlook didn™t Œ 
it was 
just questi on of ti me when he would be. And everybody begged hi m to leave the 

city and go and fight in the woods with t he partisans, but he was so involved with 

the underground in 
Warsaw
 that he didn™t go. And sure enough, he was caught in 
one of the regular streetcar searches. They st opped the streetcar, and he and his 

second in command started running off, and the 
SS
 men were running behind him

and shooting machine guns. And finally he got to a house with a garden, and he was 
jumping over a fence, and one of the 
SS
 men g ot to him. He ran out of bullets, so 
they started fighting hand to hand. And 
Ludwig
 tried to kill hi m by Œ the German, 
by biting his throat through, but another German came through and shot him point 

blank into the Œ so when I found out that he was killed there, I ran over there, and 
his body was already removed, but his brain was still lyi ng on Œ on Œ on Œ on Œ on Œ 
o-on Œ on the ground. And I just swore t hat I would revenge hi m, and every time I 

killed a German during the uprising, I would say, it™s for you. I loved that man. 

Q: I wanted to ask you, what did he mean t o you? 

A: Oh, he was everyt hing. He was my best friend, he was m y teacher, he was m y 

scoutmaster, he was my captain. He was the one who got me int o the arm y, and 

who Œ whose ideal s Œ he was a great  orator, and he knew Polish literature by heart. 
And he would Œ on every national holida y, he would line us up, all 150 in the 
company in a line, and would orate the poems of 
Mickiewicz
 and 
 
 and 
Polish Œ j ust to keep up the Œ our spirit, our nat ional identity, and our l ove of 

freedom. So he was feeding us the things which we as kids, needed most. Love of 

Poland
. 

Q: I can™t imagine what that must have felt like, to see somebody you loved, and 

only part of him there.

A: He is buried in the mil itary sera Œ cemet ery now, and every ti me I got to 
Warsaw
, I go and lay some flowers on his grave. 
Q: So his body was discovered, and was buried. 

A: Yes, he was di Œ his body was taken to a pol Œ police Œ police barracks, and then 
the Œ I guess the y were buried somewhere, i n a Œ the place, and after t he war he was 
found, and buried with mil itary honors. He is a Œ he is Œ after I found out he was 
killed, I and another boy spent the night tearing up the street signs on the street that 

we lived Œ t hat he li ved, was 
Karchanjeski
(ph) street. Then we repai nted it with his 

pseudo names, and hanged them up, so we renamed the street in hi s honor. 

Q: What were some of his pseudonyms? 

A: He had three; 
Mihau
(ph) Œ 
Mi chael
, 
Hardy
(ph), and 
Goliut
(ph). 
Q: Wow.
 
A: He had to change three ti mes, i n order to maintain his secrec y. The last one was 
Goliat
(ph). And 
Goliat
(ph) is the one that  I took over after I was arrested. Before 
that, it was 
Chernatski
(ph), but I Œ I change it  to 
Goliat
(ph) in his honor. 
Q: After you were released, did you have a chance to talk to your own father about 

what had gone on i n prison, or about anything? 

A: A little, a little. I thi nk he knew. He went through it himself, so he knew 

perfectly well what I went through. It didn™t take much. I t alked a lot to 
Ludwig

when he came over and spent the night, in the country. He Œ all he wanted to know, 
what happened to 
Steffa
(ph), and how she was. And he congratul ated me for not 

spilling the beans under the torture. He pro Œ proposed me for a medal, and he was 

just proud of me. 

Q: What ki nd of activities did you get involved with after these things? 
A: Well, after this, I was just so full of hate, and a desire for revenge on these 
beasts, on the Germans, that killed m y friends in the ghett o, and outsi de, that I went 

in search of wet Œ di sarmi ng German soldiers. And I and another guys were able to 

get some old guns. I had a old American western 
Colt
, about this size. And we 

spent the whole night l ooking for Germans, individual Germans t hat we could cat ch 

and disarm, without killing them, because for every German, there were 20 to a 

hundred Poles, innocent civilians, shot on the same place. This mass 
[indecipherable]
. And we find Œ in the morni ng, we found downtown, a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
sergeant, a big sergeant, with a beautiful gun on his side, getting onto the front of 

the streetcar, which was only 
Nur für Deutschen
, only for Germans, and we 

followed hi m. But besi des this sergeant, t here were five other soldiers, regular 

soldiers with rifles. And the y all got off at the railroad stat ion, the 
Danzig
-
Warsaw
 
railroad station, near 
. And we thought we woul d run down the steps, and 
hid under t he viaduct, and disarm him before t he other soldiers came down. Well, 

 
Interview with Julian Kulski

we faced hi m with both our guns, and said 
[indecipherable]
 
or you
 are dead. And 
he, instead of raising his hands, being a seasoned soldier, started opening up his 
gun, and pulling out. So it was a question us or them, and we bot h fired, and he fell 

on his face. And he was the first German that I killed. And my initial reaction was, 

they were supposed to be supermen, and yet t hey were human. You were able to kill 
them. You know, as a 13 year old boy, I was Œ I Œ I was surprise. And then, of 
course, we saw the four guys coming towards us, about 20 feet ahead of us, and 

they saw what was happening, so we started running. And the y took the rifles off 

and started shooting at us, and we run up the embankment, and near the ghetto 

walls, and by the ghetto walls we got to downtown. And then, on the way back, 

we™re told not to go through Œ near the stat ion, because the German were arresting 

people left and right. And next day the y ki lled 20 women and chil dren on that spot. 
There is a sign, and every t ime I go there, I feel responsible for the death of these 
poor people. 

Q: Th Œ so was that Œ t hat is something that™s been a burden for you. 

A: Yeah, for your whol e life. It™s Œ it Œ and I mean, it wasn™t m y fault, it was a 

mat ter of life and death, it was war, but the results were something that ver-
v ery 

deeply Œ first it was that boy, and now the 20 women and children. And it was after 

that that m y father send me to the countryside again, to try to hide me.

Q: Yeah. And then after that, how did life progress? What  happened? 
A: Well, then I Œ I Œ I Œ  I was Œ the commandoes heard about my acti ons, and I was 
able to join them. And the commandoes had t he advantage, that the y were 

responsible carrying out the Œ the death sentence on Poles who sold Jews to the 

Germans, who were traitorous, who were collaborators. A-And so, we had an 
opportunity to kill  some Germans l egally after that. It was, again, prett y horrible, 
because we had to go i nto their homes, sometimes kill the family, as well as the 

individual,because they we 
Œ 
they were 
well armed, and t he y would defend 
themselves during the execution.
 
Q: That™s huge. 

A: Then, we were all prayi ng that there wil l be an uprising, and t he commanders 

were ordered in full, under arms, for 10 da ys before. And we™re all, my whole unit, 
about 14 of us were housed in my father™s house. So my father, of course, knew 
every da y about it, t hat we™re hidden there, fully armed. And the y used to bring the 

food, big cauldrons of soup once a da y, for all  of us. And we couldn™t  wait to have 

the uprising. And then on the first of August, we got orders to go and retrieve arms 

for the whole company, from our secret place. And we™re carrying it across one of 

the major streets, and t he German car, because the y were expecting something, saw 

us and start ed firing at us. So the 
Warsaw
 uprising was started by the six of us, by

accident. It was supposed to start at five o™clock in the afternoon, and this was two

A: Well, the first ti me, I fa Œ I fought Œ I was fighting, I got the g Œ my rifle, which 
was 1939 Polish rifle, and I was able to shoot across the street at the Germans, 

while the y were shooting at us. Then, after they l eft, there was one wounded, and 

one killed, we had t o go around, and get across another boulevard. And th Œ th-
th
-
there was a t ank standi ng and machine-gunning us as we were jumping over. And 
this was the first da y of the uprising, that I got wounded. I got f Œ hit i n m y arm. It 
was somet hing that not incapacitated me, because on the other si de, t here were 

nurses. They took care of it, and I was able to continue fighting. Then that night, the 

commandant of the Œ our section of Œ the 
) 
 section, decided that the 
Germans knew already about it, and they were winning, so we Œ he took us out i nto 

the 
Kampino s
 forest, which was about 15 Œ 20 miles outside of the city
. We march 
all night. And then, while Œ the next da y we got an order from the commandant of 
the 
Warsaw
, of the whole city, to return, and we had to return. On the return, we 
were Œ we had to fight a very big battle wit h some German 
Luftwaffe
 near the 
airport, mil itary airport, to get back to our own homes. And we lost quite a few. My 

comma 
Œ commander was badly wounded, we had to leave hi m behind. And then 

we got home, and t he civilian population was very excited, and just li ke during t he 

ghetto uprising, the Œ the Jewish Œ Polish fighters raised t he Œ 
the Jewishand Polish 

flags. The Polish flags were fl ying from every home, and we were welcomed, and Œ

by the civilians, and they helped us build barri cades. So we build the barricades, 
and we mounted the front lines, and the Germans Œ when the Germans started 

attacking, we woul d let  them go behind our positions. The y were stopped at the 

barricades, and then they would get into fire from our buildings, and from behind 

the barricade. So th-they lost quit e Œ in the first few days, the y lost a l ot of soldiers. 
Q: The Germans did. 

A: The German. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Also I Œ I took a pri soner, one of the Germans. And he was Œ th-the Œ the 
Germans were bullies, and when they were in power, the y were heartless, but when 

they were captured, t hey were cowards. And this old guy that I captured, ges Œ 

started kissing my feet, begging me not to shoot hi m. And I said, wel l, we do not 
shoot prisoners. But they knew that the y shot us, because the y di dn™t consider us 
arm y, the y considered us bandits. So wa Œ there was no wa y of surrendering. We 

knew that we had t o fight, or kill, ourselves. Because the way they kil led us would 

be the much more cruel  wa y. 

Q: Yeah. What happened to this German prisoner? 

A: Well, I t ook hi m over to the back, and he, t ogether wit h other German prisoners, 

did some helping i n the mi litary kitchen, and d-digging up passages underground.

me. He was an Austrian, and he was trying to tell me he was not a Nazi, he was Œ

Q: I Œ I can™t get over you™re a 14 - 15 year old boy, you know? You™re still in Œ and 
yet, you™re not, you know. You™ve been fighti ng for a while.

 men, 
but we did not shoot 
Wehrma cht

Œ we took them

Q: I see. So, the uprising lasted several weeks. 

A: Sixty-three da ys. 

Q: Sixty-three da ys. Two months. 
A: Sixty-three. And th-the Œ the Germans were Œ 
Hitler
 issued an order that he 
wanted to have every man, woman and child in 
Warsaw
 killed in the return. And 
he wanted 
Warsaw
 leveled to the ground, the way he level ed the ghet to, after the 
uprising. So the Germans came in and took the order, and in the first d
ay, th e y 
killed almost 100,000 i nnocent women, children, babies. It was a massacre. It was 

so bad that the German command had to stop i t because they knew they would not 

win the war, th-
the batt le

continued in shoot ing people. And in Œ in the 63 days, every da y they murdered the 

number of people t hat died in 9-11, in that bui lding. That™s 3,000 people a da y, for 

63 da ys. It was medieval in Œ in extent. And t hen after, we had to surrender the Œ 

they continued level ing the city to the ground, the way that Œ so by the ti me the 
Russians came in t he following year, the y were Œ

Q: Tell me, you said you were in

 the whole ti me? 
A: Right. 
Q: Did you ever venture into the city and come back, or is it what you Œ 
what you 

knew of it is what you were hearing from ot her people, who had been there? Did 

you know Œ 

A: Oh, during Œ during the uprising, it was just what I heard from people who were 
escaped from the other parts, or who came t hrough the sewers. The sewers were Œ  
were the connections. And a month later, after the Œ in the middl e of the uprising, 

m y father was Œ came across the sewers t

 from the cent er cit y, and he 
almost drowned. He slipped. And the Germans set up barriers, wi re barriers, and his 

body ran into that barri er, and his l eg was completely cut up by the Œ

A: He ri Œ he resigned t hree da ys after the for Œ on the fourth da y of the uprising he 
resigned, because he felt that he could no longer administ er the city, which was 

divided int o various sections by t he Germans. There were five secti ons of freedom 

fighters, and the y Œ separated by German arm y, and so he felt there was no need, 

and he asked th Œ t o be relieved, he and his two vice-presi dents.

Q: Oka y. 

A: Th-There was a Œ th Œ in the last few da ys of the uprising, the Russians sent 

weapons and ammunition from the low flying aircraft, without parachutes. And one

explode, but ruined the bedroom. 

Q: So, through the ceili ng? 
A: Sorry? 
Q: It came t hrough the ceiling? 

A: It came through the side wall, t hrough the wa Œ kind of near the window. Th-Th-

The y were flying these first World War planes, double planes, very, very low. The y 

would turn the engine off, and the y would fly very low, and Œ and thr Œ but, without 

the parachute. Either it was too low, or the y wanted to have everyt hing destroyed on

A: Oh, th Œ we could see them across the ri ver. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. Because th Œ 
)
 i s on the river. And on the other side of the river 
was the Red Arm y. And the Polish communist par Œ arm y. And the y t ried to Œ to 
come a few ti mes, but t hey were not trained for city fighting, and the Germans had 
su-such advanced equi pment that th
ey 
Œ most of the soldiers who came by boats 

across the ri ver were drowned. Killed. But in t he Œ in our uprising, in Œ in 1944, 

there were more Jewish-Polish freedom fight ers than there were in t he Jewish 

ghetto, which is very li ttle known. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: In my own company, t here was a whole section of about 24 freedom fighters 
from the ghetto. And they Œ they didn™t go into the 
prison camps, butt hey hid, 
because the y were afrai d that the y would not be treated Œ when the last da y of the 

uprising, t he Germans decided that the y woul d treat us as combatant s, and give us 

Geneva 
rights. We didn™t believe it, so it was a terrible experience t o have to 

surrender. We were ready to die, but we were not ready to go and lose our freedom. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And Œ

Q: How did the ti de turn against you? Because it sounds like in t he beginning you 
were Œ 
there were 
Œ you were winning. 
A: Well, we were Œ we only had enough Œ 
we had 
Œ only one in 10 had any guns at 
all. Nine were with the hands. The y were supposed to get arms from t he Germans. 

So the y were slaughtered right the very beginning. We di d win 
with tremendous 
losses, but  we won the f Œ for two months, and the Germans that capt ured us, and 

who fought in 
Stalingrad
 said that the battle of ™44 in 
Warsaw
 was worse than 
Stalingrad
. It was house to house, room to room fighting. It was hard on them, and 

hard on us, but it was Œ we had the advantage, because it was our ci ty, we knew 

every corner, practical ly in 
) 
, and we could defend oursel ves better than 
attacking. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember the names of any of these Jewish-Polish fighters 
with you?
 
A: No, I don™t, I Œ I have it at home in m y Œ i n m y books, the Œ but Œ  
Q: Did everybody still go by a pseudonym at t hat point? 

A:Oh yes, yeah.
 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Everybody

 pseudonym. It was only in the prison camps that 

we were able to declare our real names.

Q: So tell me, how did the surrender happen to you?  
A: Well, I was wounded again in the last Œ first day, and t hen I was wounded more 

seriously in the last da y. About a week before the end of the uprisi ng, I got 

pneumonia, which then turned into 
TB
. And I was very, very weak, and m y father 

was wounded in the sewers, and Œ with gangrene in his leg. So we lay i n our house. 
But when the German t anks started approaching, m y father forced me to get out of 
bed, although I had huge fever, and I could hardly walk. And we wal ked Œ he took 

me back to the front lines, because he felt I would be safer in the company, as a Œ as 
a soldier, than being caught as a insurgent wit h a gun, and wounded, because the y 

were shooting all t he wounded pri soners. They didn™t take prisoners, t hey were 

killing them. Hospitals and everybody. So he t ook me there, and the whole cit
y was 
in a flame. It was extremely hot and stinking, and I was given a anti-tank weapon, 
which I could hardly handle. And I was firing at one of the tanks, and I hit the t ank, 
and the tank started firing. But there was anot her stan Œ tank standing by, and 
he 

saw the wi ndow from which I fired, and he turned the gun, and fired at my window. 

And just before he fired, I jumped out. This was second story
.AndI busted my leg 
Œ 
broke my leg.
 

Q: And that™s how you were Œ 

A: It still hurts.

Q: Yeah. 
A: That was my second ti me that Œ 

Q: You were wounded.  

A: But I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ  I was fl ying down as t he gun Œ as the Œ 

Q: Shell. 
A: Œ shell was goi ng above my head. So, i t was worth it t o survi ve. And then wo Œ 
we were supposed t o fight our wa y to the 
Vistula
, and the Russians were supposed 
to send boats to pi ck us up. And of course, they didn™t, and the Germans knew 

about it, and that™s why the y forced our comm and Œ our general to surrender, 

because we 
Œ the Œ we knew that we will be all killed by the artill ery and tank fire, 
before we reached the 
Vistula
 
even.
 
Q: So you on a broken leg, and sti ll with pneumonia Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ are stil l there. Did you sa y goodbye to your father at that front li ne? 

A: No, no, my father said goodbye as he t ook me two da ys before that, and he told 

me at that time that if I survive the prison camp, which was doubtful because of m y 

pneumonia and 
TB
, I should not go back to 
Poland
 unt il 
Poland
 is free and 
independent, but try to go to 
London
, and to his brother, who was in t he Polish 

embass
y in 
London
. So that™s what I did. And then when I was in Œ I went to camp,

about five da ys before t he end of the war, it  was an internat ional camp, it was the 
largest prisoner of war camp in 
Germany
, Stalag 11a, 
Altengrabow
, 
located 
between 
Magdeburg
, and
 Œ and 
Berlin
.  
Q: So, in the heart of 
Germany

A: In the heart of 
Germany
, 
East
 
Germany
 Œ 
Q: Hm, yes, 
East
 
Germany
. 
A: Œ to be, later on, right. And of course, t o be liberated by the Russians, but I Œ I 

didn™t know that, but five da ys before, at the camp gates, arrived hundreds of trucks, 

American arm y trucks, to pick up American prisoners of war, and English an-and Œ 

and the western allies. It was an international camp. Just leave Poles and Russians 

and the Slavs behind, t o be liberated by the Russian arm y. And t h Œ it Œ the war was 

still going on. I could never figure out how they were allowed to cross the line, 
because the l ine was on the 
Elb
, and this was quite a f Œ halfway b Œ t o 
Berlin
. And 
evidently what happened was that the American arm y sent some parachute jumpers 
to jump Œ to jump into the camp, t o prevent  the Germans from murdering the 

prisoners of war before the y are liberated. Wel l, they were all caught, and the y were 

sent to the commanding officer, the German commanding officer. And they 

explained t o him that if he allows t he American trucks to cross the line, they will  Œ 

they can liberate all of the prisoners, and t he German didn™t want, obviously, to

have the western prisoners fall into Russian hands, the wa y that t he western allies 
didn™t, so he agreed to i t. And the y were all owed to go through t he German lines, all 

the wa y to t he camp, and arrive at the camp and started loading American prisoners. 

And I had made friends with a Pol ish-American from 
Chicago
, and I was standi ng 

at the gate, the Germans didn™t care, the gat es were opened, and he ki nd of waved 
me in, and I couldn™t walk, so the y got me ont o the truck. And the truck drivers 
were supposed to be unarmed, they were supposed to be Red Cross, which the y 

were not. And boys wil l be boys, t he y all had machine guns above the in Œ and I 

remember the y stopped to shoot at  a deer, and then the y disarmed a couple of 

German officers in one of these little towns. We went about 75 - 80 mil es an hour 

through these little, narrow, German towns. And we got t o the other side of the 

river. Well, they stil l carried me into the barracks, and the next da y Œ we had about 
two, three days, and we started wal king already. They carri ed me. And I Œ th-the y 
wanted to take me as an American prisoner of war, and smuggle me t o 
America
, 
and I said no, I explained with my hands, because I didn™t  speak English, that I 

wanted to go to 
Lo ndon
. So the y thought, oh, this kid is really craz y, he doesn™t 
want to go to 
America
. But there were a coupl e of British 
Tommies
 walking 
by, 
and the y explained that  this guy Œ this kid want Œ was crazy, but he wants to go to 

London
. So the y took me under their arms, and took me to their camp. And then

they had the problem because the Œ the following da y, the y Œ they were going to be 
interviewed by the British intelligence, to make sure that people li ke me don™t get 
through. So the y decided to put me into one of their uniforms, which is a 

[indecipherable]
 uniform. And the y gave me t he name 
Wi lliam Jones
, and th Œ 

and then the y bandaged m y throat, so that I was shot through and lost my voice. 
And that™s the way they carried me through the colonels, and the generals who were 
interviewed individuall y; each one of the prisoners was interviewed t o make sure 

that only t he proper English prisoners got through. So the Œ 

Q: That™s amazing. 

A: Œ they saw this poor guy that cou Œ kid that  could stand by, that was a 
veteran of 

a battle of now Œ in 
Africa
, 
North Africa
. And they saluted me, they passed me 

through. Then we got onto the trucks, and went to

. And that wou Œ that 
was the vict ory day, that was five da ys later, after my liberation, and we Œ we got 

clean there, and we got debug Œ

A: I sa Œ I didn™t see my parents for 15 years, and that™s Œ I was 15 when I left, and I

A: The first ti me I was doing some school buil dings as an architect  in 
Turkey
, and I 
stopped by in 
Pol and
 i n 1960. So I left in 1944, and I didn™t see t hem until 1960. 
Q: But the y survi ved. 
A: But we had Œ t he y survive, and Œ and I was in constant  letters. My almost weekly 

letters with my Œ m y father. And I™ve got al l these letters, I™ve just passed them on 
to the museum in 
Warsaw
, where somebody i s writing a Œ the bi Œ 
a biography of 
m y father. They™re al so building a moi Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
memorial for hi m.  
Q: Tell me Œ one part t hat we skipped in this Œ 
A: Sorry? 

Q: One part  that we ski pped in this was from the ti me you were captured, to your 

transport to the pri soner of war camp, and what your experience was there. So I™d 

like to go back a little bit, and tell me: you were sick, you had your Œ you had 
pneumonia, you had a broken leg, but what happened after you had to surrender, 
and what was Œ what happ Œ what was your experience from that moment until 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, first I Œ I was Œ I-I broke up m y gun, rather than surrendering it, and then 
we were marched off, and put on trucks and sent to a temporary camp outside of
 
Warsaw
. And I remember the Gestapo man going around the camp, looking like 
they would like to murder us, but they were not allowed inside. And then the y were

put Œ put on cattle t rain, and we were prisoners of the same tank regi ment. It was a Œ 
the Œ now I can™t remember it, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s a elite German tank regiment 

and th-the general in charge of Œ give us a pep talk that how many tanks we have 

killed, how many soldiers of his, what wonderful soldiers we were. 

Q: An enem y general sayi ng this? 
A: In German, you know, he was being a Œ 
he was a ex
-cavalry officer, and he 
knew that our Poli sh general from Olympic games in 
Berlin
, and they were friends. 
So he tried to be very straightforward, and Œ but he said, if we tried to escape from 

the Œ the train, then we would, of course, be shot. And the Œ th Œ his Œ th-the Œ the Œ 
those German soldiers that were Œ t hat survived the battle, were going on home 

leave on the same train. So the y were Œ th-
they wereour guards. 
 
Q: How did they behave towards you? 
A: The y behaved very well, but I was dyi ng and sick. I had Œ I just disgraced m yself 
in-in Œ in Œ  in Œ in the thing, and I™m surprised that my Œ if they could they would 

have thrown me out of that thing, was Œ I was so sick I couldn™t sit, I couldn™t Œ and 

I couldn™t stand and there was no place to si t down. It was a cattle train, like the 

same trains that the y took people to gas chambers. And the y woul dn™t Œ I remember 

we stopped in 
Berl in
, t here was a big allied air raid, and so that pleased us 
enormously. And t hen we got to t he camp, and the y didn™t have any space, the camp

was so full. And it  was rainy, it was cold, i t was wet. So I had to spend about two, 
three nights on the ground. 

Q: And you™re already sick. 

A: With the Œ raining on me, already sick. So I Œ I was pretty much dying when 

some English nurse found me, and the y took me to a 
TB
 hos Œ so-call ed hospital. 
And there were Œ we di dn™t have any beds, it was just the same wooden benches as 
in an Œ any other concentration camp, or prisoner of war camp. And the only 

difference between concentration camp and Œ and a prison camp was that they tried 

to kill you with Œ by not feeding you. So i t was starvation and hard work. The y 

would send you to coal mi nes and stone quarries, and you lasted about a week. B ut 

because I had 
TB
, and I was dying, the y didn™t send me to Œ 
to work. Andthat™s 
Œ 

that™s how I survived. And once I got out of being sick, I went speciall y and Œ and Œ 
and Œ to another barrack where the y had cert ai n diseases of skin, and I got it m yself, 
so that Œ it  was very unpleasant, very horrible, but that kept me from going to the Œ 

to the Œ so I survived, but I was skin and bones at the end, and depressed, and I 

really wanted to die there. But it Œ it was horrible. 

Q: Oka y then, let™s go back to 
England
 now. At the very beginni ng of our 
interview, you said that your doctors in Œ in 
Britain
 Œ 

A: Militar
y doctor.

Q: Military doctor, suggested that one of the ways you could heal is by writing 
down what  happened to you. 

A: Well, there were two things, one was t he physical. They didn™t know how to take 

care of escaped prisoners of war, and the y put me on nor
maldiet; egg,rich milk and 
everything. The result was that my body turned into huge carbuncles. I just coul dn™t 
absorb rich food, and it  al most kil led me with the good, rich food. But th-the worst 
thing was the psychological. I had night mares. I would keep on fighti ng in the 

middle of the night . I would end up standi ng up on the Œ m y bed, and I threw the 

side lamp in the corner because I thought I was throwing grenades. And I wa Œ I 

was in Œ in no condition to go into normal life, let alone any kind of education. So 

the doctor suggested that I write down my memoirs, ma Œ in the form of a diary. 

And I sat down Œ I was very fortunately to be i nvited Œ I Œ I Œ I had very bad 
relations wi th m y uncle. My uncle was a member Œ was a complet ely different man 
from m y father. He was 10 years younger, he never fought in any war, he was a 

very comfortable, childless couple, lived for themselves, and just a real diplom Œ 
a 

gr Œ diplomats 
[indeci pherable]
. So when I arrived, he blamed me for the 
Warsaw
 
uprising. And I™d lost m y friends, m y whole cit y, m y whole family. And the y 

wanted to adopt me. So, we didn™t get along, but fortunately, there was a English 

aristocrat, who was a member of parliament, a woman cal led Lady 
Ida Copeland
,

who was a Member of Parliament, in 1935 visited 
Warsaw
 with a group of British 
MPs
, and was entert ained at the city hall by my father. So when t he word got 
through the British government, that the son of the president of 
Warsaw
 arrived in 
such 
a 
terrible shape, she invited me into her palatial estat e in 
Cornwall
. And so I 

found m yself from hell, in heaven. I was met at Œ at 
Truro
 in Œ i n 
Cornwall
 
by a 
chauffeur with a 
Rolls Royce
, and I was taken to the this gorgeous vi Œ house, ri ght 

on the waterfront, with hundreds of acres of land. It Œ the Œ the family was the 

Copeland
 china, the famous china. And she was very interested in Polish affairs. 

She was a good friend of 
Ignacy Paderewski
, and she put me in the same bedroom 

that he had, with a view of the Œ o-o-of the Œ the ocean.  

Q: Tell Œ tell peopl e who was 
Ignacy Paderewski
. 

A: 
Ignacy Paderewski
 was the great Poli sh pi anist, and pri me mi nist er in the first 
World War.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And Œ 

Q: So what kind of Œ 
wa 
Œ you say you Œ 
you hadn't 
Œ  you suffered from 
night mares. 

A: Right.

Q: What ki nd of personality did you have at that point? How had you been changed, 
how were you traumatized? 

A: I had no patience. I had no patience wit h ot her people™s problems, because I 

thought the y were un Œ completely ridiculous and uni mportant, i n comparison t o 

what I went through, and what m y friends, 
Zula
(ph) and 
Ludwig
 and everybody 
else went through. And when they complai n about the weather, or complain about 

th-the clothes, or complain about anything, I had no patience, and I was very, very 

difficult to live wit h for that reason. Because, after all, everybody™s problems is a 

big problem, but at  that  ti me I didn™t realize. And i-i-i-it went through Œ at least 

through m y first marriage, that I wasn™t a very good husband. And I went through 

what now everybody recognize as t he post traumat ic Œ 

Q: Stress disorder. 
A: Œ stress syndrome. But in those da ys nobody knew, so the y al most killed me 
with good food, and they al most Œ and didn™t recognize m y problems. But, I was 

lucky, because in Œ 
Lady 
Copeland
 
became m y fairy 
godmo
ther. She not only Œ 
well, I Œ I Œ  when I arri ved there, I arrived i n m y battle dress, and my duffle bag. 

When I got to the bedroom, there was a bl ack tie ready, and the regul ar clothes that 

she bought, shoes. And every night we would dress for dinner. This was still Œ it 

was a s Œ 60 room house, and some beautiful antiques, and beautif Œ anten Œ and

interesting people, and at breakfast I am a Œ we would just help ourselves, we had a 
big buffet, and that™s where I got all  that rich food that al most killed me. But she Œ 

in the afternoon Œ i n Œ in the morni ng and earl y afternoon, I woul d write m y story 

down, and then she would take me for rides in ca Œ 
when she 
Œ and she was very 
involved i n social l ife. And I alwa ys, always went with her in her 
Rolls Royce
, 
driving around. And I remember one day on the radio of the 
Rolls Royce
 
came 
through information that 
Winston Churchill
 lost the elections, and she burst in 

tears, because she was very close friend of 
Churchill™s
. And that™s the only ti me 

that I was able to take her into m y arms, t he old lady, and try to cheer her up. But 

she didn™t Œ after I left and went back to 
L ondon
, she arranged to have me go and 

be admitted to the t op elite school in northern 
Ireland
, the 
Eaton
 of northern 

Ireland
, and I spent a year and a half there, being a normal schoolboy. 
Q: Amazing. Amazing, how could that happen? 
A: Well, the headmaster and the masters all  knew my story, but on purpose the y 

didn™t allow me to get i nvolved with it. So I Œ I Œ I was on the crew, I did all the 

sports, and I learned English, of course. I excelled in English lit erature. I had 

problems in mathemati cs and Œ and Œ and physics, chemi stry, but I was very good 

in history and in English. I was a top student. And then I got m y 
Oxford
 and 
Cambridge 
school cert ificate, and I had a choice of what I was goi ng to become, a

lawyer, doct or or architect. I wanted to be a brain surgeon, but in order to get into a 
medi Œ school of medicine, you had to learn Latin, and I was just  learning Engli sh, 

and that didn™t appeal to me, so I decided t o become an architect. And then I was 

admitted to 
Oxford
 next year, and Œ  

Q: This would be what year? 
A: This was Œ well, I got there in 1945, I sta yed through Œ I graduated in the end of 
1946 with 
Oxford
 and 
Cambridge 
school cert ificate. It was 1947 Œ 1947 - ™48. 
Q: That you entered 
O xford
? 
A: That I entered 
Oxford
 for not quite a year. I was a very rebellious student sti ll, 

and I didn™t  like the traditional curriculum, and I was thrown out  because I was Œ 

instead of doing a house for a British ambassador in 
Athens
, I was doing 
Frank 

Lloyd Wright™s 
house in 
Arizona
. So I l eft, and then I got my visa and came to 
America
. 

Q: Well, how did Œ how did that Œ well, first of all, I want to go back a little bit  with 
your schooling. For somebody who had had no formal schooling throughout those 

very formative years, of you know, middle school and high school gymnasium, as it 

would be in 
Europe
 Œ 
A: Right.

Q: Œ how is it that only a year and a half schooling got you up to faw Œ college 
level? That™s an amazing achievement. 

A: Well, not only t o college level, I never went to college. I went strai ght to Œ 

Q: The uni versity? 

A: No, to Œ went to the Œ the master™s degree. I didn™t Œ 
Q: You didn™t Œ you bypassed a bachelor™s. 
A: The graduate school . 

Q: You went to graduat e school. 

A: Yeah, to graduate school. So I Œ I Œ I had ki ndergarten, t wo years, then I had a 

year and a half high school, and t hen I went t o graduate school. And m y feeling is 

thatso many years are wastedi
-
in college. Th
-Th-Th Œ if Œ if the high school is at a 
high level Œ and the high school in Œ in 
Eng land
 was excellent. It was at least 
second year of college, if not third. So that when I got to 
Yale
, they Œ the y wanted Œ 
oh, there™s another funny story, if you want to hear about i t. When I was still at  

Oxford
 School of Architecture, I applied to t hree school s in 
America
; to 
Harvard
,
 

Yale
, and another school. And 
Yale
 se Œ was t he one who showed int erest in me, 

but the y asked for a Œ t he credit hours from 
Oxford
. So I went t o the dean of the 

school of architecture i n 
Oxford
, and Œ Dr. 
Ri ce
, and I sai d, well, here is the letter. 

Can you write a lett er and tell them how many credit hours? And he said, what?

These Americans are crazy. You know that you are here working seven da ys a 
week, 12 hours a da y. And he added it all up in seven hours, and I had more credit 

hours than Œ than a 
PhD
. So when I got to 
Yale
, they did Œ the y want ed to put me in 
the last year of graduate school.  

Q:Oh m y gosh.
 
A: And I had to convince them that  I didn™t  learn anything at 
Oxford
. I insisted on 
repeating the first year, and it was the best decision I made. 
Q:Oh m y goodness.
 

A: But I was a scholarship student, I had the Œ I had no mone y, and Œ 

Q: Did you have any family in the 
United States
? 

A: Well,Ihad my u
ncl e, but I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ we had no Œ no contact. 

Q: That meant your father™s brother from 
London
? 
A: Right, right, he ended up as a professor at t he University of 
Alabama
, 
Tuscaloosa
. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But we Œ we Œ we Œ we-we broke relations altogether. We just couldn™t get 

along. So he didn™t hel p me at all. And then, coming over on the 
Queen Mary
, I 
met  an American girl, and a year lat er, I marri ed her. So I became an American

citizen very quickly. And she Œ we were marri ed through 
Yale
 graduate school, and 
had children. 
Q: Oka y. How many children did you have? 

A: Two. 

Q: Two. And why did you leave the 
U
.
K
. for the 
United States
?  
A: Why did I leave 
United Kingdom
?  
Q: Correct. 
A: Well, there was Œ I think one was an architectural reason. I didn™t li ke traditional 

architecture. I wanted t o do modern architecture, and 
America
 beckoned, from 
library and everythi ng I saw, 
Frank Lloyd Wright 
and 
Louis Kahn
 and th-the 
great American archit ects were here. The second, I felt that I want ed to become a 

full citizen of a country. I knew I couldn™t go back to 
Poland
 because it was under 
Russian occupation. And I knew t hat I would have better chance of becoming 

Am
erican than a Bri tish citizen. And Œ but m y British friends felt that  I was maki ng 
a big mistake, and they were very sorry to see me go, but Œ and when I arrived here, 

I realized how lucky I was in 
England
. 
A
, I was part of the elite, I had veterans 

benefits, I Œ th-the government paid for m y education at 
Oxford
, and here I arrive 
with five dollars in m y pocket, and the Œ without knowing anybody. I Œ again, I 

couldn™t Œ I went t o uncle, but we Œ we couldn™t get along, so I left, and I arrived in

Boston
 with five dollars in m y pocket, I couldn™t find work. I went to Œ tried to find 
work as a ste-stevedore, and Œ a-
and
 they laughed me off. So I was starving for 
about a month. And finall y, I got to 
Cape Cod
, where m y future wife lived, and I 
became a wai ter. And I was trained, and then started saving mone y, and that pai d 
for the first year of 
Yal e
. 
Q: Amazing, amazing. In some wa ys you™ve answered this questi on in part, but how 
did what you experienced shape you? What kind of a person did i t make you? 

A: Well, physically, if something doesn™t kill you, it makes you stronger. You 

probably know from the people who were in 
S iberia
 that didn™t die, they Œ they 

became stronger. The climate, the conditions, and particularly during the growing 

up years, develop
ment years,physically, you beco
me stronger. Also, having 
experience al l the difficulties, you become much stronger as a person, and you don™t 
allow anything to keep you from your career goals. So I knew what I wanted to be, 
and I was able to do it, and to conquer all t he difficulties. 

Q: Did the nightmares go awa y? 

A: And I t hink it™s all t hanks Œ sorry? 

Q: Did the night mares go awa y? Did the night mares go away?

A: Mostly, yes. And Œ and I have kept it out by writing about it, by sharing this with 
other people, to prepare American kids for life. And I find that very satisfactory, 

and have a l ot Œ made a lot of friends. 

Q: Did Œ 
when you met yourfamily again, tha 
Œ your parents, and I take it your 
sister must  have st a yed in 
Poland
, is that right? 
A: Yes. 

Q: That would have been 1959 - 1960? 

A: Right. 

Q: In those years. 

A: The first ti me. What  Œ did you have the opportunity to find out and talk about the 

things that  you couldn™t talk about  during the war years? 

Q: Some. I saw Œ 
I met  
Steffa
(ph), who was out Œ straight out of 
Auschwitz
 with 
her number on the leg, and I Œ I bought some flowers, I took it. So we tooked Œ I 

talked with 
Steffa
(ph) about 
Ludwig
, and about those things. And I t alked with m y 
parents, but  since we were in constant correspondence, I knew what was happening 

there, and they knew about m y life. But was great, the gett ing back, but 
Warsaw
 
was not the same place. And the thing which I really missed, was the Jewish sect ion 

of 
Warsaw
, because it was completely destroyed, and never rebuilt . So the place 
where there is the Jewi sh memorial, the Jewish history museum, now was Œ these

were residential streets, with beautiful architecture, and it™s all gone. A-And so, I Œ I 
get lost in that part of the ci-city. The old city, and certain monument s, and 

)
, the place that I was brought up, has changed very little. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Does your family house still stand? 
A: No, wel l, had Œ they had Œ that stands, but they had to sell it during the war, 

because my father™s sal ary was so inadequate, it lasted only for five days of the 

month, the rest of the ti me my mother had to bring in food, and Œ and Œ and sell it 
on the black market. So they Œ the y had to Œ m y mother had to sell all the jewelry
, 
and the y Œ finally, they had to sell the house, with the understanding that we coul d 

live til the end of the war. But they used t he mone y to pa y off the Œ the debt on the 
house, and bought a si Œ a country house, where my mother had t he garden. 
Q: Di Œ were there any actions about Œ agai nst your father, or for your father, after 

the countr y went com munist, gi ven that he had a prominent position. 

A: That™s a very good question, and the y™re being asked all the ti me. Yes, m y father 

was offered ministerial  positions in the communist government, which he refused. 

So he lived in a very Œ in a workers™ house, a t iny, little place, and Œ a-and Œ and in 

real poverty. But he never, of course, joined t he communists. So the Œ he was an

enemy of the state. They knew about it. But fortunately, before the war, he was 
involved as vice-president, building a lot of workers™ housing. And t he socialist s, 

who were i n the first communist government, remembered his contri butions for 

social welfare to the people, and one of them became his protector. And he pi Œ not 

only protect ed his life, but the whole family. So th Œ he di d whatever he could, you 
know. He didn™t last in his job very long, but he was well-placed, and high 
government  official, and he was able to save them. 

Q: So, that  meant t hat Œ 
[technical interruption, break]
 So, we were talking about 

postwar, and Œ and that  there was some Œ your father had a protector i n the social ist 

party, which at first was allied wit h the communist party in 
Poland
. 

A: Right. 

Q: What was this gentleman™s name?

to save my father from the jail. 

Q: I see. When Œ di d he also arrange for a place for him to Œ to live? 

A: Well, he couldn™t do much, there was so li ttle housing. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And the only housing that was left were the pre Œ the very, very workers™ houses 

that m y father and he worked on before the war. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So that was where my father ended. 

Q: And did your father have Œ what  kind a work did he do, or did he do any work

A: My father was work in

Q: Oka y. Is there anyt hing else that you think we should talk about, that we should 
explore here today, i n having discussed all these unbelievable years, and 

unbelievabl e events that happened t o you, that you think i s i mportant for people to 

know about? 

A: Well, I t hink it™s important to know that freedom is not free, that you have to 
remember it on a dai ly basis. You have to teach this to the children, so the history 
wouldn™t repeat itself. And I™m afraid hist ory does repeat i tself. We can see that i n Œ 

in what™s happening in the world today. The middle Œ 
Mi ddle East
, 
Ukra ine
. And I 
think that our children are being di sadvantaged by not being educated properly 

about the Holocaust, about the second World War, about t he need to be on guard to 

save your independence. Just because we had forefathers who fought in the 

revolution, and made t his country, doesn™t mean that we have to l ower our guard, 
and not defend it on a dail y basis. And you have things happening, which shouldn™t 
be happening. People being hurt which shouldn™t be hurt. And I t hink it™s the Œ for 

example, the scout movement, which I think i s extremely i mportant i n training the 

character of the young people, is being maligned. There™s many hi gh school kids, 

who when the y try to be patriotic, or Œ or Œ are being discouraged for Œ or Œ or even 

thrown out of school for carrying flags, or sa yi ng Œ believing in God, or in Œ in Œ in

-and not spoiling the children. I t hink it™s a t errible thing to Œ just because the 
parents have an easier l ife, they make it so easy for the chi ldren that they go and 
look for satisfaction with drugs, and smoking and sex, and Œ and Œ 
an
d all kinds of 
bad things, because they lack ideology. And I think the y™re starved for the ideology. 

And I find that when I t alk to the groups of young people, the y are just starved for 
m y words, they Œ because the y don™t get i t at home, the y don™t get it in school.  
Q: So, you™d sa y for Œ for values that are be yond themsel ves. 
A: For values which they are not getting, and they know that they should be getti ng. 

Q: I see. What about 
Poland™s
 young people? Have you had an opportunity to t alk 

to them? 

A: Yes. T
he 
Œ there is certain amount of the same thing, because since 

independence, and the ones who were Œ never encountered German or Russian 
oppression, don™t fully appreciate it. On the other hand, I think there™s still enough 
adults and teachers, who are teaching history, recent history. For example, when I 

was there last mont h, I saw 100,000 young people doing a marathon on the da y of 

the 
Warsaw
 
uprising. There
 were three days of festivities; 
theaters, pla ys, movies. 
Thr-Three movies were made, enormous movies about the 
Warsaw 
uprising. So, 

that™s always kept Œ that, together with the solidarity movement and

hi mself says that solidarit y wouldn™t exist , if it wasn™t for the upri sing. That the Œ 
the roots were in the fight for freedom and independence t hat we fought for in 1944. 

Q: Well, how do you make that direct connection? If the uprising hadn't happened, 

why would solidarity not happen? 

A: Well, according t o 
Walesa
, the spirit of Polish history is the 19
th
 century 
uprising. First ni Œ first the 
 
 uprisi ng at the beginning of the 18
th
 
century, 18 Œ 19
th
 century, 1830, 1863, 1944. And then 
solidarity in 1979 
Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ 1980. So thi s was something which was passed from father to son, from the 

grandfather to the grandson, and kept alive the will to li ve in freedom, and not be 

satisfied to be a slave. And that™s why 
Walesa
 says in his introducti on in m y new 

book, that if it wasn™t for our actions in ™44, he feels that the solidarit y movement 
would not exist today, and 
Poland
 woul dn™t be f
ree.
 He makes that very direct Œ  
Q: Connect ion. 
A: Œ line Œ conja Œ and his own father was arrested, and di ed at the age of 33, so he 

didn™t know his father. 

Q: And what was i t like at the 75
th
 anniversary Œ  
A: Seventieth.

Q: Seventieth anniversary, excuse me, of the uprising? And you saw all of Œ the 
marathon, and the celebrations and the comm emoration of this. And you were there. 

How many of the former people Œ how many people like you are still  here, who 

could see that, and Œ 

A: Not many, but those mostly ol der and sicker, there are Œ a lot of in the 
wheelchairs. But the i mportant thing was the way that the Œ today™s citizens treat ed 

us veterans. Taxi drivers refused to take fees, restaurants were free. Hotels were 

free. It was just making it Œ us feel that the y owe us a debt of gratitude. And it was 

very satisfyi ng. And young people, the Œ for each one of us veterans, there was 

always a boy scout or a girl scout that would t ake each one under the arms, take us 

to the seats, sit down and look after us, bring us water. So we were Œ we-were Œ 

were well looked after. 
Q: I think t hat™s a wonderful, fitting image Œ  
A: Isn™t it? Right. 

Q: Œ and tri bute, you know, with which to end our interview toda y. And f Œ with 

that, I woul d like t o thank you, Mr.
