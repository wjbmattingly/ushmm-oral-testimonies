    Emphasis on Brother™
s Story -- Peter Wi nternitz 
 

A: Bogart but my ma iden name  was Wi nter
nitz, W- i-n-t-e-r-n-i-
t-z.  I was growing 
up in Prague.  My imme diate family were
 my parents and a brother, Peter, who 
was four years older than I.  We  ha
d a  wonderful life and childhood until March 

15, 1939 when Hitler occupied our country  
 

Q: Can I ask you a few questions? 

 

A: Goahead. 

 

Q: Lisl,L-e-i-s-l? 

 

A: L-i-s- l. 

 

Q: The date you were born, your birth date? 

 

A: May 7, 1926 which happens to be 
the day of my liberation too. 
 

Q: Nice symme t ry there.  Ca n I ask you 
a little bit about Prague when you were 
growing up, where you lived, if you reme mber the street, what your house was 

like? 
 

A: Right.  We  l i ved in Prague 10 which 
was Karlin, K-a-r-l-i-n.  The street wa s 
called, Karlova, K-a-r-l-o-v-a which la
ter under the Germans was changed to 
Nymburska.  My identification is Œ N- y-m- b-u-r-s-k-a. 
 

Q: What did your parents do for a liv
ing?   Your father and your mother? 
 

A: My father was a businessman.  He had a 
store of wholesale/re tail place of floor 
coverings which was, as soon as we were occupied, taken away by his own 

employees, Czech.  Later on, by the Germans. 
 

Q: So the Czechs took the shop 
over and then the Ge rmans --? 
 

A: Took it away from the m 

 

Q: From the Czechs? 

 

A: On their own.  Wa s not the law yet. 

 

Q: Did you and your brother go to public school? 

 
2
 
A: We went to public sc hools, to German schools and in ™37 when things became  ---.  
The andr_______started, we transferred to Czech schools. 
 

Q: Did you speak German a t  the time, at home  and things or did you speak --? 

 

A: Both languages, we were bilingual. 

 

Q: Both Germa n and Czech.  How 
about Yiddish, did you speak Yiddish? 
 

A: Not at all. 

 

Q: No? 

 

A; Never, never heard a word of Yiddish. 

 

Q: You and your brother also, did eith
er of you, were you involved in youth 
organizations? 
 

A: My brother was involved in the Zi
onist youth organization, M________ Hatzair. 

 

Q: What kind of things 
did he do there, do you know? 
 

A: He got me  t o join against our parents™ wishes. 

 

Q: Theydisapproved? 
 
A: They disapproved.  In the end as I™m pu
tting it together, after the war, mu ch later, 
due to the Zionist youth organization, I was saved. 
 

Q: Why don™t you tell me  a little bit about th
at since we™ve alrea
dy started to talk 
about it?   Go ahead. 
 

A: Well, it™s a long story in itself but the 
leadership of the Zionist youth organization, 
first we set up a whole ﬁHelping Handﬂ group 
when the transports started.  Later 
on, the same  leadership in Terezin and othe
r camps tried to get us into positions 

where we either could be of help, teac
hing, helping or, as la
ter on proved, got me  
out of a transport and into the BlimaMica which was a war production, which in 

the end saved my life.  Many instances
 during my stay in Te rezin happened 
because the underground move ment
 of this leadership ---. 
 

Q: Were able to do things for you? 

 

A: Were able to, indirectly.  Even so, the l
eader ship was all killed, all put into the gas 
and so on.  Some  of us were able to get 
to certain jobs in certain positions, where 
in the end we  were saved.

Q: Did either of you or your brother and 
since your brother was older he probably 
did, I™m not sure if you did, finished 
school, finish high school before --? 
 

A: Neither one of us. 

 

Q: Neither one of you did before the war? 

 

A: No, no.  We  were both thrown out.  He
 was in his sixth year of _______ and I was 
in my second year.  Neither one of us finished. 
 

Q: Do you remember any instances of overt
 anti-Semitism before the war started -- 
like in the early thirtie
s when you were a child? 
 

A: Not directly reme mber on me.  I was r
eally too young.  But there were incidents, 
unrest in the streets and against the Jews
.  In schools some  of the_______ in our 
class and______ which was _______were agains
t us.  But personally on myself, 
the first day of our occupation when a 
teacher yelled at me , you dirty filthy Jew 
and spit in my face and wouldn™t 
let me  come  in the class. 
 

Q: That was the first day of occupation? 

 

A: First day of occupation, March 15, 1939.  
That was my first contact with personal 
hatred against me  on my  body, on myself.  Until then, I was only 13 years old so I 

didn™t really identify. 
 
Q: When Hitler came to power and I know this is probably hard for you to reme mber 
but you may reme mber through your parent
s™ reactions or your brother™s 
reactions, wa s there a feeli
ng of fear about what was 
going on in Germany?   Or 
was -- did people really know what was going on? 
 
A: We knew and I knew because we had family
 in Austria, in Vienna.  They were 
occupied a year before.  They tried ille
gally to cross the border at night and to 

come  to Cze c hoslovakia.  That™s anothe
r whole story.  They paid to be taken 
across the border illegally and whoever 
they paid to, took the money and never 
guided them across.  There were ma ny storie
s like that.  They finally did ma ke it 
on their own, illegally across.  Now when 
I came  home from school that day I was 
told to be very quiet because some body 
was sleeping in our house that came .  I 

was not told then illegall
y because it was too dangerous for me to know.  Later on 
I was told; I was 12 at that time .  We  
learned and we knew what was happening.  
We also had ma ny friends from Ger many co
me  to Prague and relatives who were 
already, before that, persecuted and escaped
 to Prague.  Of course, they were 
caught, later on in Prague. 
 

Q: Was there, I reme mber, I™m in fact r
eading a book about Franz Kafka and Prague 
at the turn of the century.  Was ther
e a great rivalry between the Czechs and 

 
4
Germans going on at the time?   Do you re
me mbe r  a whole lot of unrest in that 
kind of area? 
 
A: Well the andr ess really came with th
e Sudetenland which was the mobilization 
which was in the fall of ™38.  That™s real
ly the time we becam
e a ware of all that 
and were taken out of the German schools. 
 There were riot s in the streets and all 
that where we were caught once trying to
 get home  fro m wh ere we were.  As 
Jews, we didn™t even dare to cross or go n
ear it.  It took us 
like three hours, four 
hours to get home. 
 

Q: To go around?   

 

A: To go around and I reme mber we were sepa
rated at a point and I got scared.  That 
stayed with me  but this was before we  were occupied.  That was when the 

Andres______started.  Fr om little thing like th
at, I reme mber the various tensions 
and feelings.  My parents always, when th
ey talked, it was always in whispers so 
we wouldn™t -- the children should not 
know.  We  were at that time being 
protected.  La ter on the table turned and 
we had to protect our parents but that 
came later on.  
 

Q: Why don™t you tell me  a little bit abou
t when the city was occupied by the 
Germans in 1939?   You told me  the 
one incident with the teacher. 
 

A: That was the first day. 

 

Q: Yeah.  What happened when the German
s ca me  i n?   Did they imme diately put 
restrictions on Jews or ..? 
 

A: Slowly, day by day the laws kept comi ng 
in day by day.  From all the things we 
had to give up, valuables, art collections, 
anything of value.  Later on the radios, 
the telephones, the phonographs and restric
tions.  Later, no public pl aces allowed 
for Jews from a muse me nt halls, mo vies, theatres, restaurants, any public place, 

playgrounds, parks and so on.  Public tran
sportation which was restricted.  Of 
course the identificati
on with the Jewish star, you are we
ll aware of that, I™m sure.  
Food stamps  where we had th
e red ﬁJﬂ printed into it. 
 

Q: Were you made to shop at certai
n stores or at certain time s? 
 

A: Certain stores and certain times and onl
y certain items of food.  The lines were 
usually very long which was always very 
degrading for the older people.  Again 
the Zionist youth organization, this He lpi
ng Hand, we would take the carts and go 
to the stores and stay in line.  Run ba
ck and forth and get the food whatever was 
needed for the others. 
 

 
5
Q: So you and your brother helped out with
 this organization 
during the occupation 
days?   Did the organization work to try to
 aid Prague™s Jews, that™s what it was 
set  up for?  
 

A: That™s what it was set up for including
 to go on Hachshara.  Hachshara me ant the 
preparation to go to Israel to learn to
 far m and work the land.  But again you 
couldn™t offi cially call it Hach
shara so we were assigned to help the farmers in the 
country as unpaid labor. 
 

Q: So you went out in the countryside? 

 

A: My brother went to farm, it was about 
ma ybe eight or ten from the -- again the 
Zionist youth organization.  They worked
 various farms.  We  younger could not 
go, we only went daytime to the farms.  Again this was at the time when we could 

no longer take public transportation.  If
 there was a two-car train, we were 
permitted to take the last  car and the platfo
rm of the last  car to go to this work.  
We had a separate permission slip.  If th
e train had only one car, we were not 
permitted at all.  We had to be home before the curfew.  This was before the 

transpor ts started. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Once the transports started, we had to stop on all that? 

 

Q: When did the transports start from Pr ague? 

 
A: First transpor t went out in October, ™
41.  Five transports at 1,000 each to Lodz.  
After that, two transports followed Nove
mber and December called --.  First one 
was 250 me n,_________ which was arbeit
_________ working group one which 
were only men, to Terezin to build up 
the camp.  Terezin was a garrison town.  
The second transport, my  brother was in that, were 1,000 young me n, 18, 17, 18 
years old and older, to____________ colony two,
 to build up Theresienstadt.  The 
bunks and the barracks and all 
that.  After that, transpor
t after transport always 
left, 1,000 people each. 
 

Q: Every day or every few weeks or some thing? 

 

A: No, some times two, three in a row.  Th
en there were a few days of nothing and 
then ma ybe a week again followed by every day. 
 

Q: Do you remember how people were notif
ied for these transports?   Li ke your 
brother, did a letter come, 
or did some one just show up. 
 

A: From the Jewish council, Jewish office,
 they had to put together the list which 
they had to go to the SS to the Gestapo.  
From the Jewish elders, you send out, at 
that time we  still had young people worki
ng there with the notification, the name  

 
6
of the transport and with th
at we had to go to the hol
ding place which was an old 
exhibition hall emptied out called the Me
ssacalanda.  Some time s we had a couple 
of hours, someti mes even more.  We were
 permitted to take one small suitcase or 
backpack, some thing we could carry. 
 
Q: Was there a limit on how many pounds th
at could be?   Do you reme mber? 
 

A:  There was and I don™t reme mber it anymore.  It was some thing like 20 kilo but 
I™m not sure.  I really am not sure but 
I know there was a way we could pack and 
again the youth organizati
on we called that formed Helping Hand would send us 
out to the older people that 
couldn™t carry and couldn™t 
pack. We  would pack for 
them.  Like we had a way of packing the s
hoes to the side and the blankets.  Since 
in Europe you had this old-style, 
heavy down-feather
_______, it was called 
blankets, we established a sewing room wh
ere people could bring ahead of time in 
preparation for transports, 
their blankets.  We  would empty out the feathers, we 
would stitch it small and flat and restuff 
it with their feathers.  That was called Œ 

we sort of established a room this size, a sewing room.  Everybody was prepared 

and had sort of a blanket you could roll up and put on top of your --. 
 

Q: It™sinteresting. 

 

A: Which was all done by the Zionist youth or
ganizations, all volunt
eers.  We helped 
to do these things. 
 

Q: Did you have any contact w
ith your brother after -- betw
een the time that he left 
and you left, did letters come  back from hi m?  
A: No letters, nothing.  He was able 
to send out through so
mebody on a little -- I 
reme mber that so clearly -- a little to
rn piece of pa per with one word on it, 
Terezin.  So we knew wher
e he was at the time. 
 

Q: But that™s it? 

 

A: That was it.  That was pretty dangerou
s to do at any rate for who s muggled.  The 
way he smuggled it out, if he would ha
ve been caught including whoever helped 
him s muggle it and brought it back to us. 
 Later on we followed him and we saw 
him in the camp.  We were in the same Terezin. 
 

Q: Let me  backtrack just a little bit. 
 Wh en you -- you said the transports began 
October of 1941?   So you were basically 
in occupied Prague for over two years? 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Was there any ghetto ever set up in Pra
gue?   Or were you forced to move to a 
certain area? 
 

 
7
A: No, we stayed in our apartment. We  were 
very lucky at that.  My aunt lived in the 
same  building and another aunt had to move out of her apartment.  I don™t 
reme mber why and she moved in with us.  We  could stay until we were  

transported in our apartment.  We  had to
 give up all our belongings from there 
and everything but we did stay in our apartment. 
 

Q: Because I reme mber, I™m trying to reme
mber.  I™ve been to Prague once and I 
reme mber the Karlin area.  I also reme mb
er that there was a Jewish ghetto just 
where Jews lived. 
 

A: Which was in the auch_________, the old part
 where the eldest 
were set up.  We  
had, it was called ma don, the Zionist organiza
tion had their own people live there, 
the young people that came from other town
s and cities as they were being all 
brought into Prague for transports. 
 

Q: So when people were brought into
 Pr ague they were housed there? 
 

A: They were put into the center, right. 

 

Q: But the rest of -- any other Jews --? 

 

A: More or less stayed.  If there was a nee
d, they were put into apartments with other 
Jews but in that sense we were very lu
cky.  Just my aunt was put in with us. 
 

Q: I see.  Now at this point, after your br
other left, it is you a
nd your aunt and your 
parents are living in the apartment? 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: When were you forced to leave? 

 

A: My aunt left before we did. My parents 
and I left July 13, ™42.  The transport was, 
I just gave the name  here for the office. 
 

Q: You have it?  It™s upstairs? 

 

A: Upstairs in the --. 

 

Q: I can find it there. 

 

A: It™s AAR 395 was the number.  The name
 of the transport was RRL.  It started 
with A to Z.  Then came  AA to AZ a nd we were in AAR.  
 

Q: So you™re almost at the end of the second --? 

 

A: No, third.  Third time  alphabet around.  They were almost daily. 

 
8
 
Q: Did they come  to your apartment and ju
st ask you to leave or were you notified 
ahead of time like gi ven a w
eek or something like that? 
 

A: No, no, never a week.  A few hours or 
the most was a day, but hours at a time. 
 

 (Another interviewer™s voice:
  Let us interrupt you.) 
 

A: I really would like 
to tell you a littl
e bit more about my brother. 
 

Q: Susie has your story? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: I™ll talk to her then.  Okay, go ahead, tell me  anything you like. 

 

A: Not Susie, what was the lady™s na me? 

 

Q: (The lady that was just here to see us
.  Susan Cohen).  Okay Susan Cohen, one of 
her volunteers. 
 

A: One of her volunteers called me  and 
she has my whole story over the phone. 
 

Q: (Then we can fill in areas if you n
eed to).  That™s fine, that™s great. 
 

A: We started in and out 
with my brother, right? 
 

Q: Right.  I think the last time we talked 
about him, he had just been sent on the 
transpor t? 
 

A: Right and then we followe
d later, my parents and I. 
 

Q: You can tell me  about wh
en he was in Terezin? 
 

A: In Terezin, he was assigned to work for th
e SS, to take care of their horses, one of 
the jobs, as a stable boy.  Fo
r that he also had lumps of sugar which the horses get 
at night.  At one point my mother was ve ry sick and he tried to smuggle out some  

of the sugar to her barrack.  He was caught
 by one of the SS and was taken to the 
ma ______ which is the ________ in Terezin 
which was the punishing center 
about a mile, two miles out of Terezin wher
e the artists of Terezin were taken and 
so on.  From there, nobody ever returne
d.  Usually you were tortured to death, 
they all send out to the gas chamber butafter about three days, he came  back.  

They still needed him as the stable boy but
 in these three days, he was so tortured 
or beaten that we didn™t r
ecognize his face almost.  For just a few lousy lumps of 
sugar.  That was one story about him. 
 

 
9
Q: Did he say anything about what they had done to him?  
 

A: No, no.  We  didn™t ask, we 
didn™t talk.  We didn™t have 
the opportunity or the --. 
 

Q: Or the inclination? 

 

A: Inclination.  We really couldn™t --.  
We knew what happened. 
 Another story that 
I™m putting together now.  As a ma tter of f
act, just a week ago or two weeks ago.  
He worked for the SS, he was very handy.  He was given ma terials to do for the -- 

either the wives of the SS or the German soldiers I don™t know -- like pins or book 

markers or little things like that out of me
tal and leather strips.  He ma de some  for 
me  and I saved them.  I have those various things. 
 

Q: You still have them? 

 

A: I have them but I found in a book in the Precious Legacy book which is now in 
Prague, the exhibition but it 
traveled through the United 
States, a picture of one 
item that was made for the purpose when 
the Red Cross came to Terezin, there 
was a sports event st aged. 
 

Q: Oh there were? 

 

A: Right, a football game  was staged in one 
of the barracks.  For that event, a trophy, 
was a leather strip and I saw the picture in 
this book which is identical to what he 
ma de.  It was found after liberation in camp, this item.  I would say 99% sure that 

he must have ma de that.  I have no proof but --. 
 

Q: But that™s what he did? 

 

A: He did and I have an item almost identical
 to that.  It™s in the same shape and all 
so I got it.  That was one thing he did, 
was forced to do, for the SS.  The other 
story I like to tell about him that my pare
nt and I received notif
ication for what is 
now called the Mass______which was the 
transport of 5,000 Czechoslovak Jews 
sent from Terezin to Auschw
itz.  At the time he was not in that transport because 

he was covered, protected, working for the SS.
  They needed him so he was not in 
that transport.  He volunteered. 
 

Q: To go on the transport? 

 

A: To go on that transport.  As we boarded 
the cattle cars for that transpor t, I was 
taken out of this transport already on the 
ramp to the car.  Later on I put together 
as I was telling you about the Zionist yout
h organization, due to them I think.  
(Male voice: Also the Germans wanted
 5,000 and not 5,000 and one).  That I put 
together  later.  There were 
four,  (It was their choice w
hom t hey would take off).  
Right.  Anyhow, 5,000 left.  This is the transpor t, I don™t know if you™re familiar 

with it, when they arrived in Auschwitz, they were  kept toge ther as fa mililager 

 
10
Birkenau which is where I have the cards
 that I received which are upstairs too.  
He perished in that transport.  He 
volunteered, he took my number, I found out 
later on, my transport number.  Later on 
I also found out that there were 5,004 on 
this transport.  They had said only 5,000 can
 be.  So four were taken out.  Since 
there were obviously four vol
unteers, one of which is my brother.  (He went to be 
of help to your parents, thought he might be
 able to help them).  I, in turn, was 
taken out due ma ybe to the influence of the Zionist youth organization.  (Was 
their choice, their choice).  Their choi ce to 
decide the four.  (It was their choice to 
decide whom to send).  I think also because
 from the last nu mbers and we were in 

the 4,500 category so that 
also was part of it. 
 

Q: Why don™t we stop here and we can --. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

 END OF FIRST TAPE.  FOLLOWI
NG IS TAP ED PHONE  INTERVIE W 
COMPLETED AT A LATER DATE. 
 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: My brother™s name  is Peter Wi nterni
tz.  He was born in Prague on April 28, 1922. 
 

Q: Now when we talked before, you said that you lived in Karlin? 

 

A: Karlin which was Prague Ten at that time, yes. 

 
Q: And that your father was a w
holesale rug -- he was selling rugs? 
 
A: Wholesale/retail floor coverings.  Not 
just rugs.  He had 
the floor coverings. 
 

Q: Did he have his own shop? 

 

A: He had his own store. 

 

Q: Let™s see.  It was just you and your
 brother, yes?   Those are the only two 
children?  
 

A: That™s the only children. 

 

Q: He was born in 1922 so he was older than you were? 

 

A: He was four years older than I. 

 

Q: You said that you went, when you went
 to school, you started in Czech schools? 
 

 
11
A: No, we started German s c hools.  Then we
 had to transfer from Ger man s c hools to 
Czech schools. 
 
Q: When did you transfer? 

 

A: In ™36 or ™37, I don™t remember.  As 
t hings were starting up, we  had to leave 
German schools. 
 

Q: Because of anti-Semitism?  

 

A: Yes,anti-Semitism.  

 

Q: You said that -- you did me ntion in th
e earlier interview that your brother was 
involved with some  Zionist organizations
.  Do you reme mber what they were? 
 

A: Yeah, he belonged to the youth gr
oup, the Zionist youth organization, the 
_________Hatzair.  Due to him, I also joined. 
 

Q: What kind of things did -- what kind
 of get-togethers or functions did the 
organization have? 
 

A: Well, Maccabi_________Hatzair was Israeli-oriented, preparation for life in 
Israel at the kibbutz.  So we all we
nt on Hachshara which was a preparation 
working for far mers, living with the fa rm
ers in the countryside.  Which, later on, 
helped us as far as work was concer
ned in the concentration camp, including 

Terezin.  It helped him, he
 was assigned as having so
-called experience.  He was 
assigned as a stable boy to work for the 
horses that belonged
 to the SS and he 
even lived in the stables. 
 

Q: Were there lectures and things about
 Israel and that ki
nd of stories about 
Palestine?  
 

A: Yes.  We  had meetings, we were readi
ng.  As a ma tter of fac t , we were already 
teaching the younger children.  Later on wh
en we were not permitted to go to 
school, we arranged Hillsteens which was 
sort of a group ﬁHelping Handﬂ when 
the transport started.  Taking the people 
to the assembly place, packing for them 
because we each were pe rmitted originally to take one package, one backpack or 

one little suitcase.  The Zionist youth or
ganization was sort of the Helping Hand 
everyplace including in the camps trying to help the smaller children, teaching, 

keeping up the morale in Terezin, even
 trying to arrange for singing, poetry, 
writing, any kind of education. 
 

Q: Right.  Speaking of education, you said 
that you didn™t finish
 high school before 
the war.  Did your brother? 
 

A: No.  He also didn™t finish. 

 
12
 
Q: No, he didn™t either? 

 

A: He had one year left. 

 

Q: He was almost done.  Can you tell me  
a little bit about the occupation and what 
your brother was doing when the Germans ca me  in? 
 

A: Well we were in school when the Germans occupied us in 1939.  Then when we 
were imme diately thrown out of school, ev
en before it was turned into law, he 
started working for the Zi onist youth orga
nization, of which actually the leading 
ma n was written up in many books, Freyda Hi
rsch.  You mi ght have heard that 
name.  With him and with other younger pe
ople, he was instrume ntal to work on a 
place called H_______in Prague which was the on
ly place left  for us to go.  It was 
a huge sports field where we continued not
 only sports activity, but educational 

activity, lectures, study groups, schooling 
and so on.  He was part of that 

leadership. 
 

Q: You said it was like a sporting field.  Wa s it open? 

 

A: Yeah, it was a big open field and that wa
s the only place left for Jewish to go after 
we were no longer permitted to go to any public places, pl aygrounds, mo vies, 

theatres, schools, etc.  Since we couldn™
t take any public transport any more, for 

most of us it was almost over an hour wa
lk to get there.  But it was one place 

where we could talk, be together; othe rwise it was never permitted to be more 

than two or three people together. 
 So this gave us a perfect place. 
 

Q: To gather and --? 

 

A: To gather and continue sort of our work. 

 

Q: You me ntioned a few restrictions that we
re placed on Jews.  What other kinds of 
things were placed -- did you have to 
wear a Jewish star at this time? 
 

A: We had to wear the Jewish star, yes. 
 The laws were comi ng out day by day.  We  
had to give up all our radios, our telephones,
 our record players, our records.  We  
had to give up all our valu
ables, any kind of art colle
ction or later on or so 
naturally, jewelry.  My father was a 
big stamp collector, well-known stamp 
collector.  He  had to give  up his stam
p collection.  We were no longer permitted 

public transportation or own bi
cycles or cars -- bus, taxis, trains, trolley-cars, no 
public pl ace, movie theatres.  Certain stores
 were not permitted for Jews to enter.  
We had a curfew, seven o™clock we
 had to be off the streets. 
 

Q: How long after the Germans came into the 
city was the curfew in place?   Pretty 
quickly or --? 
 

 
13
A: Pretty quickly, almost day by day laws were comi ng out.  I don™t exactly 
reme mber the successi on which started fi
rst, I think giving up all valuables was 
one of the very first ones. 
 
Q: You me ntioned earlier you and your brot
her being involved in the Helping Hand 
organization.  Once the Germans came in, th
e restrictions started, did the Helping 
Hand organization become
 more active in trying to help people? 
 

A: Yes, it became sort of, a l most legalized. 
 It was under the umbrella of the Jewish 
Elder. 
 

Q: Like the Jewish Council or some thing? 

 

A: Yeah, Jewish Council.  We established 
two or three rooms in a building there and 
it was sort of the communications center 
to send out the transport notices.  We  
followed up with the notices imme diately, 
helping the people pack, getting them 
to the assembly place.  Prior to that , we had another room, we were not permitted 

to take those big European bla
nkets, you know_____. Everybody was hoping we 
could take blankets.  We  took the 
big______opened them up, took out all the 
feathers and stitched them into very thin
 little blankets.  We  s t uffed them and 
rolled them up so people could take it on 
their backpack.  Of course we had, got 
permission to be after seven o™cloc
k on the street.  It was a special 

au______special papers stating for that day 
we had permission to be on the street 

after 7 o™clock to help with the packing and getting people to the assembly. 
 

Q: You and your brother, both of you did this? 
 
A: Yeah.  We ll, no, not the sewing, only the 
girls did the sewing and working.  But 
he did more the packing the office had.  
But he left in one of the very first 
transpor ts. 
 

Q: Your brother did?   Do y
ou reme mbe r  when that was? 
 

A: Yes.  He let n the very special tran
sport in December ™41.  Second transport to 
Terezin which was called AK 2, the first 
transport was AK 1, consisting of 280, I 
believe, young me n to build up Terezin 
into a camp.  AK sta nds for Arbeit 
Kolona and he was in the second transpor
t a week later, Arbeit Kolona 2 which 

was a thousand young men. 
 

Q: That was in December of ™41. 

 

A: December of ™41, I don™t reme mber the exact da te.  They were one week apart, 
those two transports.  They went directly
 to one of the barracks called Sudeten 
Barrack to build it up. 
 

Q: At this point, Theresiens
tadt was just being opened? 

 
14
 
A: Right, it was a small garrison town at 
the time housing a
bout 6,000, five to six 
thousand people.  They were moved out. 
 

Q: Oh, the people who were there, were moved out ? 

 

A: Right.  It was turned into concentration 
camp.  The two transports were sort of the 
forerunners to build a bu
nk center, to build it up into a concentration camp. 
 

Q: Let me  go back just a little bit.  
Whe n your brother was deported, and since you 
helped with some  of the -- getting pe
ople ready to go on the deportation, can you 
describe for me a little bit of the depo
rtation.  Wh at would happen, like pe ople 
would get a notice and then
 they would be told? 
 

A: There was no telephone 
so people got the notice. 
 

Q: Throughthema il? 

 

A: No, no.  We  took it or the 
Germans would give the list to the Jewish Elder and we 
in turn would take the notification.  
Or some ti mes people we re just, by the 
Germans, taken off the street.  A whole 
street was closed up.  But most of the 
time, we we nt to the houses.   As a ma
tter of fact, we rang the doorbell.  If the 

doorbell rang, it meant bad news.  Either it 
was SS or a transpor
tation notice.  If 
you went yourself some place, you would ne
ver da re to ring a doorbell.  You™d 
only knock on the door.  Doorbell ringing m
eant a disaster.  The notices were 
handed out that way or if we worked 
in the office and we knew who was on the 
transpor t, we could send out quickly because sometimes you didn™t have much 

time to get to the assembly place.  Some times you had four or five hours, 

some ti me s if you were lucky, half a day. 
 

Q: Now is that what happened with your 
brother since they knew him at the --? 
 

A: We knew that this transport of young me n will be assembled within probably a 
few hours.  So pretty much we anticipated he would be in it and before we turned 

around, we learned yes, he was on that list.  When he came  home and I was home 

at that time , I knew when he came home that this is what had happened by his 

face.  We  told our parents and I reme mb
er my mother and father standi ng by the 
door when he left, just holding hands.  Th
en of course when we got our notice, I 
kept sort of the front up and kept tel
ling my mother that  ma ybe we be soon 
together with Peter.  We  had a few hours to get to the holding place.  Since I was 

fa miliar, havi ng worked on it  knowing the 
holding place and all, I got help from 

some  of our friends.  They walked
 with us to the holding place. 
 

Q: Did you leave shortly after your 
brother or a few months later? 
 

A: We left a few months 
later, we were in June. 

 
15
 
Q: In June of ™42? 

 

A: June of ™42.  Wa s 50 years ago. 

 

Q: When people left from Pr
ague, they left on trains? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Being sent to Theresienstadt? 

 

A: Yes, first we went to the assembly 
place which wa s an old exhibition hall which 
was cleared out.  There we were held 
for about two, two and a half days.  A 
thousand people always sitting on a concre
te floor, me n, wome n, children, babies.  
In our transport we were there 2 ½ days a
nd then we were take n to the train which 

was about -- in back of the building, cam
e to the back of the building.  So me 
trains were regular passenger 
cars, most of them were ca
ttle cars.  Some were a 
mi xture of everything.  I reme mber being 
with my parents in the same  car which 

was a cattle car. 
 

Q: When you got to Theresienstadt, how
 long was it after that you found your 
brother? 
 

A: Actually, to Theresienstadt, the trai ns at
 that time  did not lead all the way into 
Terezin.  We  had about, if they stopped 
in a little village before which was 
B______.  Then we had like half an hour walk into Terezin. 
 

Q: So you didn™t actually go into 
Terezin, you walked into Terezin? 
 

A: You had to walk at that time.  Later 
on, the railroad went all the way in.  The 
tracks were laid all the wa y into Terezi
n, was a faster pr ocedur e for loading and 

unloading the people, for getting them in a
nd out.  We  were earlier so we had to 
walk in a column of three with SS all al
ongside of us.  We  ha d about a 20-minute, 
half an hour walk.  We  walked through 
the gate.  The gate said like all camps, 
Arbeit Macht Frei which means work ma kesfree.  In the camp, I kept asking as 

we walked through the slau______---.  You we
re taken to a place where you were 

searched and stripped which was called slau_______, means like a sluice.  There 

were people working who were already in 
Terezin and I kept asking them if they 
knew my brother.  He was still there and 
then ma ybe a day or 
two later, I really 
don™t reme mber, it took a day or two to locate him and see him.  Then I told him 

which barrack my mother was and he was able to go there. 
 

Q: There was no segregation of ma les and fe ma les? 

 

A: Yes, there we re different barracks.  But 
we were able in the beginning at least to 
go after work, if we were still able to or some thing, to go to that barrack. 

 
16
 
Q: You could actually see each other? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Before when I talked to you, you had to
ld me  that -- and actually you said it 
earlier today, that you
r brother took care of the horses for the SS. 
 

A: Right.  He also did some thing else.  
He was very handy, artistically handy.  The 
SS provided him with materials where he
 ma de different pins and chokers, 
necklaces for their wives and girlfriends. 
 He ma naged always to out of little 
remnants and pieces, ma ke things for me  
or for my mother.  I have a couple of 

those things. 
 

Q: Oh you do. 

 

A: I happened to find, just recently, in th
e book of the Precious Legacy, a picture of 
one item that after liberation was found in Terezin. 
 

Q: Do you think he mi ght have ma de it? 

 

A: There is no doubt in my mi nd that he must
 have ma de that.  It was found in the -- 
where the SS lived in the _______.  It™s so id
entical, the picture to
 the item I have.  
I wish I could fi nd out where that item is.  I™m still working on that. 
 

Q: That sounds like quite a j
ob, that will be, to look for that.  Let me see -- you said 
that since your brother to
ok care of the SS™s horses and now he also ma de things 
for the wives of the SS.  Do you know how he became involved and was able to 

get jobs like that, involved with the SS? 
 

A: Well, when you came in, you were always 
asked and filled out what work or what 
you do?  Or what were you?   He, of course
, that was part of all the Zionist youth 
organizations, the Hachshara helped us. 
 Because the girls or  the boys were on 
Hachshara, again inTerezin were as
signed to_______ which was a -- working 
outside the camp for the far mers, working on the fa rmland.  Hachshara was a 

training for Israel, to work on the land.  
So they used that and again the youth 
Zionist organization helped and the Jewi
sh Elders brought younger people, some  

of my friends in my barrack.  So due to 
that, they are now in Israel, a number of 
them. 
 

Q: Because they had the training? 

 

A: Because they had the training, becaus
e the Zionist youth organization helped, 
including at that time Edda 
Schtein (who later on himsel
f was killed at Auschwitz 
with his family.  There is a book written 
about him now for the Elders The Jewish 
Elder I think it is called by Ruth Bondy 
who was also a me mbe r  of that youth 

 
17
organization which is now in Israel.  By ju
st saying that he worked in the fields 
and he worked with horses, on that Hachsh
ara, he was assigned 
to the st ables, the 
SS stables. 
 
A> As a ma tter of fact, he 
received lump s of sugar for th
e horses.  Every night they 
would get like after they were groomed and al
l that, a lump of sugar.  At one point 
my mother was very sick and he tried to 
get the sugar, some  of the lumps  of sugar 
to her.  But he was caught by one of the German policemen, not SS, German 

police that policed us.  He was taken to the punishment center which was 

MA_____you mi ght have heard that word, wh
ich was three miles out of Terezin, 
but was still part of Terezin.    The artis
ts of Terezin were taken there.  Usually, 
everybody taken there was killed or tortur
ed to death there.  Nobody survived.  
But he came  back to the camp about three 
days later but so brutally beaten and 
tortured that we hardly recognized him. 
 In the three days.  But the reason he 
came back, at that time  we understood, he was needed for the horses.  He  was 

especially good with the horses.  Some
 of the SS got him out but he looked 
terrible.  For just a few lumps of sugar which were good for horses but not good 

for his mother, for Jewish life. 
 

Q: You also said that your br other earlier 
when we talked, ma de me dals for a soccer 
game .  Do you reme mbe r  some thing about that? 
 

A: Themedals? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 
A: That was part of the art he did. 
 

Q: Oh, I see, for the SS? 

 

A: For the SS, those were big round circles and when the Red Cross came for the 
performa nce, there was also a soccer ga
me .  Then they were handed the winner, 
the winning teams were handed in front of 
the Red Cross team, the Red Cross that 
came. those medals. 
 

Q: Your brother had ma de those me dals? 

 

A: He had ma de those.  He 
designed them.  He was told to design them.  He was told 
to design them, he was told what to do.  He had just to follow orders. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  now wh
en did your brother leave? 
 

A: LeaveTerezin?  

 

Q: Terezin.  Or 
was deported there? 

 

 
18
A: Actually my parents and I were 
in the transpor t that is called the 
MA_________transport.  Five thousand Czechos
lovakia Jews were shipped out of 
Terezin on Se ptember 7, 1943 to Auschwitz. 
 My brother, working for the SS as 

their stable boy were brought back that ca
ll, they need him.  He was protected 
from shipped out but when he learned that
 my parents and I are on that transport, 
he volunteered.  He ran to the Jewish Elder 
and asked to be put into this transport 
and got a number and joined.  As we we
re already boarding the cattle cars -- by 

then the trains came all the way into
 camp to the Ha mburger Barrack, the 
Ha mburger -- my parents were already in one
 car, my brother in another.  I was 
boarding the cattle car on that ramp, th
e SS standi ng at the ramp, called out my 
number, pushed me aside. 
 

Q: Took you off the transport? 

 

A: Took me  off the transport. 
 I didn™t know why or what 
as the train left with my 
parents and my brother.  Later on only to
wards the end when the death transports 
and the death ma rches were comi ng back to
 Terezin and on those transports were 
some  people that we knew from Terezi
n or before, through the Zionist youth 
organizations and had been in Auschwitz at 
the time, told us that this part icular 
transport went into the gas on March 7, six 
months to the day that they arrived.  
Because that was the birthday of the first pr esident of Czechoslovakia. 
 

Q: Thomas_____? 

 

A: Thomas_____, right.  That™s why this 
transport is called the __________transport.  
Actually, at that time, as far as I re
searched it and understood, out of the 5,000 
that™s also in the movie Shoah, I me n
tioned, only 2,800 were still alive.  The 
others had perished due to starvation, si
ckness, beating, etc.  My father and my 
brother had perished before. 
 

Q: Oh, they had died before? 

 

A: Of beatings, starvation, ma lnutrition, things  like that.  At that time, as far as I 
researched it, I don™t have  documents which will be ready now I hope, I ha ve to 

find out mor e , as far as I know, only my mo
ther went into the gas on March 7.  I 
was saved by being taken out and I found 
out mu ch later that the transport was 
under roster 5,000.  There were 5,004 on that 
list so four were taken off and I was 
one of the four.  Possibly that, which I 
found out later, my brother mi ght have 
taken my number. 
 

Q: Oh, I see. 

 

A: But I still had the numbe r and_________they chose his transport number was the 
one I had.  A 90% possibility, what happe
ned as the Jewish Elder, when he 
volunteered, that he 
gave him my number. 
 

 
19
Q: He took your number, to save you? 
 

A: Then know, we didn™t know saved.  But 
since they only could have five thousand 
and they had 5,004 but that is not proved fact.  I am putting this together in my 

mi nd and in my research.  I have no proof of it. 
 

Q: Now this is a bad question to ask 
you but you don™t know exactly what happened 
to your brother and father, only 
that they died before --? 
 

A: The way I understand that the 5,000 were kept
 together.  They were not separated; 
they were kept together in fa milalager Bi
rkenau.  They had to work, the ones that 
were able and the ones who died, died of 
either torture, ma lnutrition, sickness due 
to the malnutrition like we ha
d dysentery, typhoid, and so on. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you when we talked at the e
nd right before you had to leave, we were 
talking about your brother and I didn™t 
get to ask you a few questions about your 
story to the end, if that™s okay. 
 

A: Goahead. 

 

Q: They left on that transport, your pa
rents left on Se ptember 7, 1943.  From that 
time onward, what happened to you? 
 

A: I stayed in the camp.  I worked there.  
After that transpor t, after transpor ts were 
leaving and again, due to the Zionist
 youth organization and the Jewish 
ma nage me nt  that always had to put toge
ther the transport, they always were 
trying to keep some  of us, the younger pe
ople be hi nd.  In Terezin, we still had a 

chance of survival but we  knew once we are 
shipped out east, that
 there is hardly 
any chance left.  Then they needed work for war production.  War production and 

I was assigned to that war production which was a big barrack in Terezin, built 

outside the camp.  About 6,000 people we
re assigned to that war production 

which was splitting that big rock of mi ca in
to very thin slivers which were used 

for filters in the gas masks for the German soldiers.  The other work we had to do 

which also protected us at that time from
 being shipped out we re building the gas 
chambers in Terezin. 
 

Q: You helped to do that? 

 

A: Yeah.  Which were going to be opera
tional on May 11 and we were liberated on 
May 7 by the Russian army, four days before they became operational. 
 

Q: So you rema ined in Terezi
n until the end of the war? 

 

A: Till the end, right.  But then when the 
death transports were comi ng back and we 
were unloadi ng the trains of the dead 
bodies mostly, either there or someplace 
else, I don™t know, I got t
yphoid.  I ended up in the t
yphoid barracks.  Typhoid 

 
20
was contagious, the Germans had one ba
rrack where all the typhoid cases were 
taken.  I was in that barrack more or 
less unconscious when we were liberated. 
 
Q: Do you remember which -- were they Russian soldiers? 

 

A: Yes, the Russian army, we went to pass the Russian army.  We were liberated in 
the night of May 7 to May 8 which I don™t 
really reme mber.  Bu
t a friend of mi ne 
came to the typhoid barracks two days later, when I became conscious and she 

brought me  a piece of, sort of a slice of white bread which the Russian army had 

brought in for us.  Then I realized 
I must be free; then it all sank in. 
 

Q: Do you remember how l ong before you we
re liberated that you went into the 
typhoid barrack? 
 

A: No, not really, must have been just a 
couple of days.  I reme mber just sort of 
floating in and out of cons
ciousness, semi -conscious st
ate or whatever.  I don™t 
really reme mber.  Then I reme mbered be
ing carried by two sort of -- two guys, 

two inma tes and this friend of mi ne w
ho helped, carrying me  to the typhoid 
barrack but I didn™t realize 
where to.  I just knew I™
m being carried but I don™t 
know where.  The next thing I knew when I 
regained consciousness, sort of, that 
she was there, this friend of mi ne who is now
 in Israel.  We  are still the closest of 
friends.  We  went through the whole camp 
together, we helped each other and we 
remained the closest 
of friends until now. 
 

Q: What happened after liberation, what did you do? 

 
A: After liber ation I tried to get back to Pr
ague.  By then I knew that my parents and 
brother are not alive but 
I hoped that some one else, 
some  other people of my 
family.  But again I couldn™t leave Te rezin because I had to be first -- we needed a 
repatriation card on which it stated that we
 were deloused and no longer a carrier 
of anything and so on which was set up by 
the Russians.  Since Czechoslovakia, 

Prague, at that time  was 
also under the Russians. I c
ouldn™t get that since I was 
still a typhoid carrier and I was too weak 
and too sick.  But this friend of mi ne 
already was in Prague and on one of the 
trucks comi ng back to Terezin, it would 
take us about wherever we wanted to go, 
and she had sent a -- like an empty beer 
keg on that truck.  Before we came into 
Prague to the border 
like the ﬁCheckpoint 
Charlieﬂ type, like a gate where you had to
 show that you are clear, you can enter 
the city. 
 

Q: Oh, with papers and documentation and everything? 

 

A: Right. I didn™t have that 
one slip so they shoved me . 
 I crawled into that empty 
beer keg. 
 

Q: You got into that barrel? 

 

 
21
A: They covered it up with some  old blanke ts, rags that were on the truck.  That™s 
how I was actually smuggled into Prague. 
 Once there, she already had assigned 
an apartment.  What happened, the Repatr
iation Office, as we were comi ng back, 
the Germans had fled.  Their apartments were empty so the Re d Cross and the 
Repatriation Center tried to assign 
us to various empty apartments. 
 

Q: They let you settle in those apartments? 

 

A: So there was one apartment where about
 six or seven of us, in the beginning, 
stayed together.  That wa s on the fourth floor and I couldn™t walk the stairs up yet 

and I reme mber being carried up.  Then 
I recuperated, I got 
a little better and 
stronger.  Then later I started to work
 and later on I got my own apartment 

assigned.  I started getting docum
ents, everything together. 
 A year later, I had an 
uncle  here, and a year later, I came here. 
 

Q: Oh, I see.  So you had relatives in the United States? 

 

A: I had an uncle here.  At first there 
was no communication.  I couldn™t notify him, 
he couldn™t notify me .  About
 three months afterwards, he found my na me in the 
paper in New York from the Red Cross list
 of survivors.  I, in turn, knew his 
address and through a British soldier that 
came  ba ck to the Czech army, a friend 
of my brother™s, through him, thr
ough the British army, through London, through 
his mother, I was able to send a wire 
to New York, to let him know that I 
survived.  Ac tually out of my entire family, when I came back to Prague, out of 

my entire family, aunts, uncles, cous
ins, everybody, I was the only one that 
survived.  Everybody else perished.  Then 
I came here a year later and started a 
brand new life. 
 

Q: Do you remember when you arrivedin Prague, after getting out of 
Theresienstadt? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What year was that? 

 

A: What year?   That was in -- well we we
re liberated in May of ™45.  May 7, and 
about five weeks later ---. 
 

Q: You were released from -- ?  
 No, you smuggled yourself out? 
 

A: I smuggled myself out of Terezin and into Prague. 

 

Q: Then you lived in Prague for how l
ong before you went to the United States? 
 

A: A year, till ™46.  I cam
e here in July of ™46. 
 

 
22
Q: Okay, I think that™s all the questions I have. 
 

A: That about covers it all. 

 

Q: Yeah, I think we™ve gone back and fixed everything here. 

 

A: Thank you for your time . 

 

Q: Thank you for your time .  I really appreciate your 
talking to me. 
 

A: I don™t know if you™re going to use the ma te
rial on my brother for the -- for this 
project. 
 

Q: We™d like to, that™s one of 
the things -- in fact, that™s why I wa nted to get the story 
because_____ 
 

A: You have his picture? 

 

Q: Actually I™m going to turn off the tape here.  Ha ng on for a second.
