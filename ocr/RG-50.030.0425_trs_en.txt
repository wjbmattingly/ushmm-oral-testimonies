JACOB WIENER 
 February 8, 1996 
 
Q: Rabbi Weiner , whe n we fi nis hed up with your
 earlier interview,
 you wer e talk
ing about after 
Krist allnacht , in Decemb er
 of 1938, you went  to 
Ha mbur g and stayed with your sister for about a 
wee k,  wh o wa s livi ng  t here .  Wh at hap pe ned  a ft e r 
that  and a t  that poi nt , 
did you know where t he  
rest of your f a mi l y was a nd di d 
you have  any cont act wit h t he m?  
A: M y fa mil y w a s, my w hole fa
mily wa s in Ha mbur g.  M y br othe
r who ha d run a wa y from Bre me n  
had also come t o Ha mb urg.  M y 
sist er, a s I me nt ione d be for e , ha d 
been working with the family in 
Ha mbur g, s o  the y we
re all in 
Ha mbur g. 
Q: Your father? 
A: My father was also in Hamburg.  After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I 

returned to Bremen 
and we were living in the same house 
where we had lived 
before.  We were  
searching the house and 
we found the bullet whic
h had killed my mother 
and we fou
nd everything 
upsi de- down, we  put t he wh
ole  hous e  in order and we  were li vi
ng there and repair
ing as much as 
pos sibl e.  I n additi on we  t r ied t o e migr ate a nd fi nd a pl ace  wher e to e mi grate . 

Q: And  wh at  were  the  re
sults of that effort? 
A: We had written to
 several people be
fore, but the answers were us
ually, we have 
no money, we 
have no pl ac e, we li ke t o help you, but we  ca n'
t.  Now after Kristallnacht,
 whi c h was o n No ve mb er  
nint h to the  10t h, 1938 of Nove mber
, we  wrote again to these people
 and we told 
the m about my 
mother and especiall y my father
's c o usin, who was livi ng in York
t o wn( p h), Sas katc h ewa n, i f he  
coul d do anything about i t .  Thi s ti me we got a lett
er fr om hi m,  that he woul
d talk to the member of 
Parlia ment  i n Canada  and find how t o ge t us s pec ia
l per missi on.  And he woul
d then se nd us what i s  
called a landing card, t hat we were
 al lowed to land.  After a few w
eeks, we got  thi s l andi ng car d.

Now the question was to leave Germ
any.  You needed fi
rst of all, permissi
on fr om the German 
governme nt  and the y would be ther e 
when we would pac k our
 things .  But fir st of all  we ha d t o get  
tickets to go to Canada.  My fath
er  went to the Norstorchalloit(ph)
, which is a shi
ppi ng company i n  
Ger ma n y, a n d the y sai d, s i nce the Ger ma ns wa nte d us
 to take a German comp
any, they told us they 
wer e all booked up for t wo ye ars .  We  di d not wa nt
 to wait for two years, 
so my father went to 
Ha mbur g a g ain a nd Ha mbur g ha d t h
at, Ha mbur g ha d a c onnecti on wit h
 British Airline, with the 
British, not airline, with the Br
itish shipping line, the 
Koolnot(ph) Wh itestar(p
h) line and he met a 
ma n fr om t h ere a nd he s a id he woul d get us pas sa g
e to Canada.  However, to
 get t here, we needed 
first to go by ferry boat, from 
Ha mburg to Engla nd and fr om E
ngla nd to Southa mpt o n, we would 
take a boat t o Cana da .  Whe n the la ndi ng ca rt c a me,
 we gave it to hi m a nd he pre par ed us and he  
arranged for  all the necessar y thi ngs
 in order for us t o travel to 
Canada .  We  were  tra veling fi ve  
people , my father , mysel f , my t wo 
brothers  and my  sister .  But we 
nee de d mone y for t h e tickets .  I n  
order  to do t his, we ha d t o s ell 
our  house .  Now t h ere wa s one  woma
n, ____ wo ma n, who the Nazi's  
had planted into our house, she want
ed to buy it.  Of course she bo
ught it with ve
ry little money, 
just e nough mone y to pa y for t he tic
kets.  So we had the tickets and 
we set our date , I mean i n fact 
the date was set by the shi ppi ng c o mpa ny, for M ay 
31, 1939.  On that da y 
we woul d lea v e Ge r many 
with the ferry boat.  Ma ny other things happened
 between December and May, 1939.  For instance, 
one t hing which happe n ed was i n Ja nuar y, 1939.  On
 the 18th of January, 
which was the Kaiser's 
birthday, before Hitler came to
 power, I got it, I was visiting 
a friend of ours, the fa mily 
Greenberg(ph) and just about 10 
o'cl ock I got  a t elegra m whi ch sa
id, " C ome  to Berli n ."  I didn't  
know ori ginally fr om whom i t  ca
me , b ut it  ca me  fro m a fri e nd o f
 mi ne who wa s working wit h a  
Je wish or ganization, t he s a me I had 
be en wor king for and I kne w t hat I 
would go to Berlin and go to 
this organization.  He sa
id to me, my, the family I was working,
 I  was  visi ti ng, s aid to me, " G o t here

right a wa y."   So it was 10 o'cl oc k in the eve ni ng, I went t o the  train stati on and the next train wa s  
goi ng at 12 at night, so I  took t hat
 ni ght trai n.  But it was a very unc o mfortable tri p be caus e ther e 
wer e the Na zis wal ki ng in and out a nd I didn't wa nt
 to be r ecognized as a Jew at that ti me , so I 
wal ked around the trai n.  It was what we call a expr
ess trai n, where there is a hall way at the side and  
then t here ar e cabi ns in t here.  So next mor ning, 
about se ve n o'cl oc k, I arr i ved i n Berli n, it was n 't  
my fir st ti me  in Berli n.  It  was a very r ainy day a n
d a dark da y a nd I just st ar ted to walk.  I ca me t o 
the Br andenberger(ph) gate, whic h I had not see n  for , 
at all, only in pi ctur es before and there was a 

sign t hat Je ws e nter thi s  at their own risk a nd J e
ws are for b idde n to ent er this, but I  walked ver y 
quickly thr o ugh, t here was no one re
ally watchi ng me 
and I  wal ked to t his pl
ace of our or gani zation,  
I came to t h e fourth floor
 and I saw some friends of mine, they
 said yes, thank 
you for comi ng, we  
are waiti ng you, t he  Naz i s have  tol d
 us t hat i f  we  make  out c ertain a f fi da vits, whi ch wer e fa ke of  
cour se, that our fri ends , young pe
opl e you se e, woul d ha ve a  cha nce t o go to Lit huani a , Estonia a nd 
Latvia, to the Baltic states and 
they would go there on
 Hashera(ph), Hashera(
ph) means preparation 
for emigration to Israel.  Then th
ey woul d recogni ze us a nd t h ey wo
uld go there.  So t h e whole day 
we wer e  ty p i ng o ut , wit h  the ty pe
 ma chine, of course t hey ha d no 
electri c typi ng machines at that  
ti me , we we re typing ou
t letters with names and 
birthdays a n d we sai d t h at they ha d per mis sion, 
they were accepted to the 
Hashera(ph) in Latv
ia, I still have some letters 
in my files, 
and we gave 
the m to the Naz i s, a bout  200 people or so were fr
eed from c o nce ntrati on c a mp and the y ca me out.  
However , not ever yone of t hes e 
200 peopl e or so s urvi ved, bec aus
e afterwards the Na zis conquered 
Est onia and Latvia a nd Lithua nia a
nd you see and t hen t he y ca me i nto 
t heir  hands , but s o me of t he m 
mi ght  ha ve .  So that wa s i n J anuary. 

Q: Now, I want to ask you
 a fe w ques tions  about
 wh at you've just describe
d.  First of all, were you 
at thi s poi nt, supposed to be i de nti fie d as a  
Je w, did you wear  a, we
re you we aring bands? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

A: No, no, they didn'
t have this, only in
 1941 they ma de th
em, they made them 
wear  the yellow star. 
Q: And in terms of this 
operation in Berlin, wh at
 was t his  or ganization?  
A: It was a J e wi sh o r ga ni zatio n ca
lle d Agouti s(ph)  Israel a nd t hey 
wer e trying, like e ve ryone els e, 
trying to get Jews out.  Some
times you could fi
nd a Nazi who was 
a little bit softer and her would 
accept such a fake docu
ment, you see they
 knew that it was 
fake, ever yone kn
ew it was fake,  
because especially t he South Amer
ican countri es, Latin Ameri can
 countries were worki ng ve r y  
much with fa ke and with
 mone y, bribes and s o  forth, bec a u
se I  went  to the Sout h Americ an 
dipl omats  ve ry ma ny ti mes a nd t hey s a id t o me , " Giv
e us 400 dollars or so on,
 so muc h and we will  
let you out."   So I we nt , oh we d
on't  do it , go to that c o mpa ny, to 
t hat c ountry a nd t hey we re all  
worki ng together .  Many ti mes t hat 's what ha ppe ne
d and you know t his fr om
 your his t ory, pe ople 
went out and they were not permitte
d in that country because they 
said we don't, 
these are illegal 
certi fica tes , and  the y ha d to be se nt  back, like it
 happene d wit h many coun
tries.  But the Nazi's  
wer e very smart  and t h ey recogni
zed the Je w, as I me ntione d once
 before, i n the 
cl ass you se e, 
either by the  nose , or by t he ear s or 
by the color of the hair or by th
e for m of the he
ad, because they 
measured them all .  
Q: This orga nizati on t hat  you we re worki ng wit h in 
Berlin, was this i n pl a ce for years ,  was t his a n 
outgrowth of political organizatio
ns you were involved with?  
A: No, they had noth
ing to do with politic
s, actually.  They were more
 or less a Jewish _____ more, 
I woul d say more  reli gi ous  ki nd of organiz ation 
than anot her kind of  organiz ation.  But all  
orga niza tions tried so me how t o bri n g the i r me mber
s or t o br ing Je ws out , be cause I c an tell  you, 
later on when I, all ri
ght , that come s l a ter. 
Q: Wer e  you, my que sti on is, we re
 you a ffiliate d wit h this orga niza tion or si milar organi zati ons, 
years befor e ? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

A: Yes.  I was already, I was al
ready affiliated with th
is organization since 193
4.  They had such an 
orga niza tion in Bre men, where I was livi ng at th
at ti me , you se e and it 
was at fir st a Zi onist 
orga niza tion wit h whic h I was  a ffi li ated, howe ver,
 I  se par at ed fr om t he m, beca use  of rel i gi ous 
reasons and then t her e was a speci al teacher in 
Bremen, who taught us, a 
Hebrew teac
her and he 
was fr om this organization, from Ag
outis(ph) Israel and I joined hi
m.  So I was already affiliated 
wit h t his  or ganizati on. 
Q: And in 1934, wh at wa s th
e basic theme of the, the fo
cus  of t hi s or ga nizati o n?  
A: The focus was to work
 fo r the Jews to go to
 Israel , mainly at t hat  ti me , you s ee and also 
religi ousl y, t o ma ke an orga niza tion wher e the pe
ople, where the Jews es
peciall y, became mor e 
religious instead of assimilatio
n.  I t  wa s a question of a s si m
ilation.  It was 
a que stion of 
assi mila tion, e ma nci pati on.  That 's why the Zionist 
or ga niza tions , the y wer e more of the type of 
uniti ng with the others  and of s o
 fort h, wher e a s t hi s one  was  mo
re i ndi vi dualized, by the mselves . 
Q: And you felt th
at was i mport ant?  
A: Ye s.  Be c ause as I ha d me nti one d before , I s aid 
t o the  teac her  when t he y c hange d thi s, the s chool  
days, fr om Saturday, from Shabbat, 
I said to him that I don't want 
to c o me to sc hool a ny mor e on 
Shabbat, because I want to become
 more Ort hodox, l i ke  the Ger man
s wa nt  to bec o me , i n quot ation 
marks, more German. 

Q: And this wa s your, th
i s was  rea lly your own pa st, not  your fa mil y 's?  
A: No, because my father was, wa
s not as r eligi ous  you see ,  as 
my  mo th er an d my  mo ther  ca m e  
fr om a religi ous  fa mil y you see , 
but my fat her di d not 
k eep  a ll the l a ws,  but he wa s j ust J e wis h  
_____. 

Q: Bac k to Agout is(ph) in Be rlin
, was ther e any risk to what you 
we re doing or wa s this ba sicall y 
authorized? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
6 
 
 
A: It  was  not le gall y a u thoriz ed, but  ever yone  
di d it and the  Nazis  kne w
 about it wa s be done, 
because t he Nazis were i nterested at
 that time just to 
get the Je ws out , unti l  in
 1941, when the y ha d 
the fi nal solution, yo
u se e  and t hey di dn't want  the m t o ____ 
in ther e, t he y s aid, " The  world doe s not  
take the m, t he worl d does not wa nt  the m."  As  
long a s the y sa w a lett er, you se e, that anothe r  
country was taking them, 
that was enough for the m and they 
would somet i m es, not  al wa ys, let  the se 
people go and go there. 
Q: Wh en you say you we re
 a ble to hel p, maybe , a  couple  hundr ed pe ople ... 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How,  how were these peopl
e chosen fr om where they, fr
om where did you find them? 
A: The y we re no li sts , howeve r we had fr iends a
nd we kne w fr om our orga
niza tion, let 's say my  
organization in Bremen at that 
ti me, I know names and 
besides is t hey had 
names, each one has 
na mes , eac h one of the people ha s s o me na me s, so the y ga ve  the m t he na me s and if peopl e gave  

them di fferent na mes, if friends 
gave  the m fri ends na me s, a fr iend
, a friend, a  frie nd
, you se e.  So 
that's how they we
re choosi
ng them. 
Q: So you he lped whoe ve r you could?  

A: Whoe ver,ye ah, _____. 

Q: And how did you know
 t hat s o me body wa s in 
Sac hse nhausen or s o me bod
y wa s in Da cha u, or  
wherever? 

A: Thes e pe ople s o meti me s wr ote .  If the y wer e in Sac hse nha use n, it say Sachse nhausen, nea r  

Berli n.  Or Dac ha u ne ar  Munic h. 
 They wr ote and at t h
at ti me , we k ne w wh
ere the people were, 
besi des t his, as I can tell you l ater , I had some cont
act wit h the  Gest apo and the y told me t hat, " We 
have people  here  in Sachsenh
ausen," and so 
forth and forth. 
Q: How l ong di d you wor k wi
th Agoutis(ph) in Berlin? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

A: I onl y st ayed there one day, howev
er in this one day, 
you see, we di d a  lot  of thi ngs , beca use  o n  
this one da y, we wr ote al l these letter s and we br oug
ht them to the, to the Nazis and they let the m 
go, most of t he m.  And t hen
 I we nt back to Bre m en.  I was sti ll 
in contact wit h the m a fterwards, but  
this was a deadline, I thin
k thi s 18t h of Ja nuar y wa s a dea dline t hat
 they gave us, so 
we came on that  
day and made it all 
fi nal, in one day. 
Q: Busy day. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you went bac k t o Bre me n?  

A: I went back to Bre me n.  Now one da y it  ha
ppene d, we were al wa ys 
afrai d, especi ally at  
nightti me t h at the y may knock at 
the door and ta ke us a w ay a n d it ha

"You s hould have known that he is in Ha mbur g in

they left .  But they came

Many people in Germany, most peop
le, most Jews in Germany, did 
not live in the big cities, they  
lived in small hamlets, how do you 
call it, villages and they came th
en to the bigger cities to be 
safer.  So they appointed me a

a nd t he y were ver y, very rude.  
Sit down.  Then he took out a nd I 
r e me mb er t he fir s t ti me I c a me, he
 took out a bunch of pict ure s  
and pa pers and he said to me , 
"The se are the pi cture s and pape
rs which we rescued fr om your 
house ."  Res cue d, you know. 
 Wa s not rescued, they confiscated it.
  I said, "Can I have them?"  So 
he gave me a little bi
t, not everything. 
Q: Wh y we r e th
ey so ni c e?  
A: The y di d not wa nt to be co mp
let e, you see , e very per son, even
 the worst person in the world ,  
sometimes has a soft 
moment.  So he also
 had a soft  mo ment at one ti
me.  He gave 
me a little bit,  
but what I a ske d hi m t h en, most of
 the time when I went
 to hi m, I as ke d hi m, " Ca n  you get  thi s  
pers on a nd t his per son,"  I've got a fe w na me s of 
people from the Jewish 
c ongregation who were in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

concentr ation ca mp, "I want this pers on to get out
, can you get  hi m out, wil l  you let hi m out? "   And  
that was the main purpose in the fi
rst part of my c onta cts
 with them, to save pe
ople, to let them out 
of c onc entr a tion ca mps.  Someti
me s he le t the m out , but not  very
 ma ny t i me s, he  sai d , " What 's he 
goi ng to do, where 's  he going to 
go," so fort h.  The second par t  of
 my c ont act wit h
 the Gestapo was 
to have per mission to ma ke a Je wis h school , bec a use
 the chil dren di dn't ha ve
 any more school , the y  
wer e for bidden to go in Ger ma n sc hool , eve n in Je wi
sh school, no sc hool s.  So what do we wa nt to 
teach t hem i n the school s?  I want t o teach th
em how to l eave Ger ma ny 
as quick as possibl e, 
because t hat 's what you 
want.  So what woul d he teach them
?  I will  teach them Engl ish and 
geogra phy a nd cert ain things which 
t hey mi ght be able to use aft e
r the emigrate and also I will  
teach, I  will give the m a l ittle bit  of
 exercise, gymn astics or
 so, you see t h
ey have t o be strong when  
they leave.  So they we
nt on, t he y sa i d, " We ha ve  no pla ce fo
r  Ger man c hi l dren a nd be sides ," sa ys, 
"when do you want to te
ach t he chil dren?"  In 
the  morni ng you are  not all owed t o t eac h the m, he  
told me , because then German child
r en are being taught and Ger ma n 
c hil dren c annot be taught at 
the same time when Jewi
sh chil dre n a r e being taught and the 
other wa y ar ound.  So I, I negotiate d 
wit h hi m for  a long ti me and he didn'
t  want to gi ve us a Je
wish school or a place, t hen I said to hi m,  
" What about  a pl ace ," a n d I found a 
place, " near , near  that hotel t here,
 no one i s ther e, it 's not  a 
school building, but it c oul d be us e d as a schoo
l buil ding and we ca n use 
it in the afternoon." 
" When do you want to t each t he ch
il dren, what ti me?   Because th
e Ger m an chil dren go to school  
until three-thirty in the af
ternoon, you can only
 teach the m from four until ab
out six or six-thirty."  I 
said, "Okay."  So fi nall y he agr eed and we had thi s
 place t o take the Jewish childr en.  Now I made a  
list of Je wi s h chil dren, we had a bou
t 40 Je wi sh c h ildren a t  that  ti me , boys a nd girl s in al l ages , up t o 
15 or 16 yea rs of a ge a n d s o me of
 t h em came fr om smal
l  vill ages outsi de. 
 But the question was 
teachers, we had no teachers.  So
 I  knew some mer chant
s, you see and I sai d  
to t hem, you teach hi m

this, you teach him this and I'll tell you what to do
. So we, we had a fe w te
acher s, you s ee and the y  
wer e not trai ned te ac hers , but I sai d the school shou
ld not be like a very sl
ow, a ver y low ele me nt ar y 
school, but more 
like a middle scho
ol or so, like a little bit higher scho
ol and that's what it was.  So 
the sc hool opened on April 12t h, 1939.  We le ft Ger many in M ay 
1939, end of May,
 Ma y 31, 1939,  
so I wa s there just t wo mo nths , but during that  
ti me, I hir e d a teache r, 
one of my, one of my 
collea gues fr om ______ se mina ry, wh
ere he was ,  had le arne d to be a te ac her and he beca me my  
successor and the school stayed un
til about 1941, I think, when all 
the Jews were in Bremen, wer e  
sent  to Mi ns k a nd Pins k, 
in concent rat ion camps. 
Q: Co uple questions, I guess about 
s chool first .  You sai d the r e we
r e about how many student s who 
were able to? 
A: 42. 

Q: And were they all ages? 

A: Al l a ges .  
Q: Anybody wh o could, come? 
A: Anybody wh o could come. 

Q: Do you t h ink that  t h
at school was helpful 
in terms of morale, in terms of education?  
A: Yes, it was very helpful I thin
k, be caus e  the par e nts , I mea n wh
en we ha d our first meeting and I  
gave the m the introductory talk
 a bout what  the school wa s goi ng 
t o be and what we woul d b e  
teachi ng and so the parents also cam
e and it was very helpfu
l and in fact, I met 
t w o of my students 
fr om that time in New York later 
on.  In fa ct, one of my , one of, n
o, at least t wo st udents who I me t  
in Ne w Yor k , they ar e no w marrie
d, you know and their husba n ds ca me t o my c l ass es here, whi ch I  
gave here  in Ameri ca.  So
, it  was  hel p ful, I t hink. 
[e nd of si de  one , t ape  one]

Q: I wa nt t o ask you a  fe w questi ons a bout the 
Je wis h c o mmunity hous e.  Do you thi nk tha t  
ever ybody li ving t oget her ser ved a pur
pose other t han just a pl ace t o li ve?  
A: Yes.  First of all, it 
wa s sa fer, they fel t  sa fe
r bei ng t ogether, you se e, 
bei ng a mong fri ends, bei n g  
a mong people of t heir own ki nd, I me
an, that already 
ma ke s the m feel s afer.  And beside s t his, i f  
they ha d any proble ms , t hey had right awa y i n tha t
 house , pe ople whom they coul d as k and t urn t o, 
beca use t he s e, and these ,  their Je wi sh commun
ity you see , had cont acts wit h getti ng food, getti ng  
other  things an
d so forth.  
Q: Di d the Ger mans periodicall y co
me to the house,
 visit the house? 
A: They knew about it .  
I don't reme mb er any more, 
i f t hey came, because I 
was n 't li ving t her e, you 
see. 

Q: Di d pe opl e get ar ound
 much or  di d they la
r gel y stay at ho me? 
A: No, at that time 
it was still possible to
 walk around, to go
 places, it was 
possible.  The first time 
that actually, I mean that was lo
n g ti me  ag o,  i f t hey  re me mb er 
the first boycott,
 which was 1933 
______, but at that ti me , 
you could go, you 
could wal k around, of course
 you ha d to be care f ul and  
the Nazis were not all, Nazis, y
ou see.  There we
re also some Germans who 
still thought, it will pass 
over .  

Q: But when you walke d  on
 the st reets, wasn't t here a certai n 
element  of fear, a 
certai n element of 
risk? 

A: Ye s, you fel t  thi ngs might c o
me , a s I ment ione d be fore , es pecia
lly during the ni ght .  The  Nazis  
wer e using what is  call e d t wo t hi ngs .  They were
 using dece pt ion and dehuma nizat ion.  That  mea ns  

they we re de ceivi ng people and make belie ve it wa s 
not so, it 's not bad, you can do wha t  you want , 
you see , so people we nt around, bu
t t hey wer e ne ver sa fe i f s o methi ng woul d ha ppe n to the m.  So 

they were careful  and t hey wal ked
 ar ound usually, not  by t he ms elf, 
but  wit h a frie nd, wit h other s.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
13 
 
 
Q: Di d pe opl e get beat  up or  anythi ng?   
Or  just grabbed and taken some where? 
A: That happened usuall y duri ng t he  night when 
no one sa w it, bec a us e Naz i s di d not want t o do  
anything during daytime, actually.  
That's why all the time
, they were still a little 
bit reluctant to do 
things s o openly, be ca us e they didn't wa nt the wor l
d, t he pr ess to know a bout that , that t hey do do it  
ope nly.  The y wa nte d the wor l d to know and to fe ar
 that whatever t hey did 
is by law.  Therefore 
they made a law, Jews cannot go
 to school a ny mor e.  The y ma
de a l a w, l a wyer s cannot have  
practi ce i n here a ny more  and t hings  li ke t h
is , t he y wa nte d t o do everyt hing by la w. 
Q: Now, t o your knowl e dge , the pe
ople who were living in this co
mmunity house, did they have 
plans, were the plans to try to emigrate, 
what did they t hing 
was  going t o happen?  
A: At  that  ti me , a f
ter Krystallnacht, the whol
e wo rld saw and the Jews also knew, even those Je ws 
who still loved Germany and they li
ved in Germany for a long time
 and they had fa mily trees and 
they ha d a n cestors, the y  
saw that you cannot live 
in Ger ma n y any more.  
So everyone fr om that  
mo ment  on, worke d on e mi grati on, t o  find out t h
e place where to go, beca
use t hey knew t here was 
no, t hat 's why I called my school 
t he Dea d End s c hool, it was onl y to
war d an end, beca use we kne w  
we woul dn't exist fore ver .   The r
e woul d come a ti me, y
ou see , when we woul d 
have t o close and we 
did close aft erwards. 

Q: One mor e quest ion about that ho
use , beca us e  I'm just tryi ng to get a s ense of what  the daily li fe  
wa s like at  t his peri od i n  Ge r many.
  Did they, there was 
a s chool , people had t o ma ke a rrange me nts 
for religious activities or for gettin
g food, or was there an
y culture or cultural 
activities, anything 
like this?  

A: Well , the y had _____ servi ces , reli gious ser vice s 
in this buil ding, the y ha d some cla ss es, you se e,  
I also ga ve some cl
asse s as I  sai d be for e, for t r ansl ation 
for Englis h a n d s o fort h a nd _____.  
However, the community in 
Bremen consists actually of two type
s of Je ws , there 's one type of Je ws  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

whi c h wer e  the Ger ma n Je ws wh o were b orn i n

there were, was a little comm
unity, a little bit away fr
om Bremen of Eastern 
Jews.  They call it in 
Ger ma n _____, who ca me 
from eastern.  I was very friendl y w
ith t he m,  you see , be caus e I went 
there many t i mes.  They had t hei
r own community.  But they had a
ll their cul ture ali ve, because  
when they st ay t ogether, 
you see, they either
 were l earni ng a fe
w subject s or the y 
were preparing for  
e mi grati on, t hey were t aking your j ob, the y were  
le arning a  la nguage, t he y were le arni ng somet hin g 
else. 
Q: Okay, your work wit h
 the Gesta po.  Initially you sai d whe n
 you went i n, ther

took you up to Mr. 
Parchman.  Wer e t here al ways the same pe
ople t here  that  you dealt wi th, or wer e  
there di fferent officer s t h ere al l t he ti me?  

A: They were all different, but I

rc hma n.  I  alwa ys s a w hi m, most  
of the ti me .  He was ____ in c har

was i n c h arge and s o I  had to see 
hi m bec ause he was the one appoi nte d  by the Na zis  to 
have the cont act with us.  So I al ways sa w t he 
same person. 

Q: How would you desc ri be your r elat i ons hip wit h hi m?  

A: I ne ver kne w what he  would sa y.  I never kne w
 what he would s ay, but I neve r knew whether ,  
whether he  would let me  go out agai
n.  I never knew wh at kind of 
questi ons he would as k me.  But I  
told him all the time, as 
I me ntione d before , I was worki ng on t wo, 
in two areas with 
hi m, first of al l  
to get Je ws out of conce ntrati
on c a m ps, number two to have  a sc

relations hip wit h hi m and he was s
itting there with his feet on the 
table and, and tryi ng to degra de

but  I j ust  wa s nor mal , nor mal ly

i vel y kne w how to handle yours elf, whether  
he wa s parti c ularly a busive a nd in wh
a t way a nd how you res ponde d t o it . 
A: I trie d not to make hi m fe el e mba rrasse d or att ack
 the Nazi  system.  I just talked fr om my point 
of vie w , that  me ans whe n my poi nt 
of vie w, t he point of 
vi ew of the Je ws you see , that  we a r e here  
now and I know that you don't wa nt
 us here  and we  want to leav
e and t h at was always my basic 
phil osophy, my basic  phi l osophy wa
s let the Jews out of 
the concentration camps,
 so that they can 
leave Ger ma ny, let us make a school , so that  we  
can prepare  the m for emi grati on.  It was al wa ys , 
my philosophy wa s al wa ys t o get  
out  of Ger many and t hat 's really
 what he wa nted, s o I act uall y 
played on hi s wa vele ngt hs. 

Q: That was smart.  Was he
 ever  physically abusi v e? 
A: No. 
Q: Just ver ba lly?

A: Yes, for insta nce , someti mes he
 would tell me, we let these peop
le out in thr ee days, or thi s  
person is now in the concentratio

the time  he didn't want to give
 infor mati on, he want ed i n for mati on fr om me .  He want ed

Q: Di d you t ell hi m what ever  he  wa nt ed t o know?  
A: I sometimes told him a

For insta nce , he asked me , fr

So I said to hi m, "You know be

you do with it." 
 No , I never, no. 
Q: Were  ther e a ny ot her J ewi sh pe opl e  who wo

A: I woul d go t here r egularly, I 
don't think anyone els e woul d go

don't e ve n know i f he woul d come
 to the president, I 
know Mr. Ostri ch( ph) , I thi nk his na me wa s, I  
don't re me mber his na me.  I f he
 wa nted so methi ng, he, but I  wa

think I  was  t he onl y one 
who woul d go t here .  
Q: One othe r ques tion, you sai d 
you never reall y kne w what wa s 
goi ng t o  happen whe n you went  
there , were you ever r ea lly caught 
off guar d?   Were ther e some cl os e cal ls and big s u rprise s, good 
or bad?  
A: I don't reme mb er anything of this sort.  No , he
 alwa ys cons idere d hi ms e l f a nic e guy, quotati on 
mar k, by let ting me go agai n and when I as ked fo
r inst anc e, my br other  should come out of th e

A: Yeah.  21. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
17 
 
 
Q: 21, you were taking on a lot 
of responsibility, it sounds like 
you had guts and go
od instincts. 
Wh at do you think pr
epar ed you for this? 
A: I ha ve a philos ophy you see, i f poss ible to ma
ke a compr o mise and I ha
d to ma ke a compromi se ,  
in sc hool for  insta nce , when I went
 to the Nazi school. 
 And be si des t his I ma de a c o mpr o mis e  whe n  
I we nt wi th the Zi oni st youth cl

teachers in school, I al ways tried

but not gi ve up my princi ples, 
beca use whe n the tea cher s told me tha t  you c annot  go to sc hool  any mor e, I me ntione d this alre ady 
before and I just said to him, 
" We  ar e on t he sa me  wa vele ngt h, you

you go your  way a nd le arn more a b out Ger ma n y and I a m a Jew a nd 
I wa nt to lear n more about  
being a J e w. 

Q: Do you t hink t hat you 
got any of this common sense from your 
fa mi ly or you j ust l earne d it  o n  
your own in the way yo
u were brought up? 
A: Part of it, of c our se, I got 
fro m my  fa mil y, e s pe cially my mo
ther .  She c a me fr om Ha mbur g and 
she was always welcomed and she 
was al ways recognized and tried

she did favors for all t hese peop

 At that time, we didn't have 
typewriters, so people wrote lo

good handwriting, so 
she wrote letters for

Q: So you worke d wit h t he Ge sta po a nd the  Je wi

Some people  tried to slip in cer

me ans  to re gister, to si gn yours e
l f out .  You sign i n a nd you si gn 
out .  You sign out , s o you had to 
sign out be fore you le ft Ger ma n y and go t o the police 
a nd fill  out that you signe
d out.  So I went to 
the police and I sai d, we are leaving 
on Ma y 31st , I wa nt t o si gn out.  He sa id to me , " Fi ll out t his  
for m."  Fill e d out the for m and he sai d, " But y
ou didn't fill out  your addres
s where you're going to 
move to."  I said to him, "I don
't know it yet."  So he said to 
me, "Never mind, we
 Nazis will soon  
conquer the whole world 
and we will find you th
ere anyhow."  And they 
were really sure of 
the mse lve s, t hat t hat  woul d happe n, you s ee?   I  sai d  to hi m, "I  hope  not."  
Q: This is maybe an unusual ques
ti on, but was t he fe ar in Ger many 
at this point gr
eat enough t hat  
you a ctua lly thought ther e might be danger else wh
ere , or did you fe el that  once you got out , you'd  
be sa fe?  

A: I  only thought about  
one thing, I said to myse
lf, I want  to be as far away fr om Germany as 
pos sibl e, bec ause  one day there  might be war and t h
ey mi ght c onquer  the  c oun
tries around he re, so  
there fore I thought that t he Ba ltic sta t es wer e too 
close and e ven England I thought was too cl ose. 
So  when we, when we  we nt
 t o t he Uni t ed Stat es , I  t hought, that
's better , beca use  
it 's further away. 
Q: So tell me about the 
process of your leaving. 
A: All right, we packed ever ythi
ng a nd we le ft fr om Ha mbur g, as 
I me nti one d be fore , I had nearl y  
forgotte n thi s, but I found my pa
ssport, it says we left fr om Ha
mbur g.  And we sa w our relati ve s 
still, on the last day and then we 
were supposed to goby ferry, that passed 
on the Wednesday, I 
think, We dnesda y t he  31st of M ay, i n  the  e ven
i ng.   And we  went be  taxi  t o  the  ferr y. 
Q: And this wa s, who 
all was in this ...? 
A: That wa s  my fathe r , my, a nd a
ll four , all four of us .  And we 
c a me to t he port and, but our ta xi  
had to do a detour be cause
 on that da y, it just s o happe ned that
 Goering(ph) gave a speech and we  
had to have  a det our a n d he  ga ve a  spe ech on t h
at day that  was the fir st 
time that I heard it in

Ger ma n y, where he acknowl edge d a n d tol d t he world 
that they were good fr
iends of Franco, Spain 
you know, a nd t hat  he  was s ending t he m sol diers  
and sending them all othe
r things, you see, they 
wer e suppor ting t he m c o mpletel y.  
So we went on, we c a me to the 
ferry.  Before we went on the 
fer r y, they e xa mined us.  I have to tel l  you tha t  
we were only allowe d to ta ke four dolla rs out , each 
pers on, four  dollar s, it was 10 ri ce ma rk(ph), 10 mark
s, German marks, four 
dollars .  It wa s all  we  
wer e all o we d to take out  and then we  ha d nothi ng 
else because the rest  of
 the mone y which we got  
for the house was for t he 
tickets, for the, for the 
boat tickets.  So my 
fat her they exa mined 
compl etel y, I don't  know why the y di dn't e xa mi ne  us
 completely, they just 
ma de a c hec kup you see ,  
like this.  And then we 
ca me  to on t he  boat .  
Q: Now ot her tha n the four doll ars
 a  pers on, wha t  kind of me me ntos
 di d you take wit h you, what  
did you pack? 
A: Whe n we  pac ked, we pac ked cl
ot hing, a cer tain a mount of c l ot
hi ng a nd we pac ked
 a  fe w books, 
whi c h I ha d and als o, I forgot to 
me nti on that t he rabbi in Ha mbur g, at that ti me , Rabbi Kali bar( ph) , 
who was later, who didn't want to
 leave Germany and he was afterw
ards killed by the Nazis, he 
gave me  a _____, it mea ns 
a Torah scroll, whi ch I to
ok along, but not, but wh
ich was put in
 the van. 
The van was sent separately, we 
took only along a little valise, you se
e.  So we took a fe w things 
along, not t o o ma ny thi n gs
 and a  fe w pictur es  and je
welry.  Per sonal t hings . 
Q: So you got 
on the boat... 
A: No w thi s  boat wa s abo ut 1 40 0 tons , was a 
s mall boat a nd it was a  very ni ce s ailing fr o m  
Ha mbur g to England, t hr oug

A: I just tal k ed about our
 trip from Engla nd t o Ca nada and tha t
 we wer e ke pt for t hree days in the  
ocean, because of neari n g the iceber gs.  So fi nal l
y we ca me to, pa st Ne wfoundla nd, Labra dor , we  
came int o the Sai nt Lawrence Ri ver,
 the big ri ve r in Ca nada, to bring us  to Montr eal .  We fir s t  
stoppe d in Quebec a nd i n  Quebe c, so
meone came to the, to the ship
 in, from a Jewish agency and 
told us that he woul d expect us i n Montreal a nd t h
en bri ng us directly t o 
our  desti natio
n.  No w mo st 
of the ot her Je wish pe opl e who we
re on t he boat , kne w where  they w
oul d be going, the y kne w t he y  
would be going to relati ves whom t hey kne w al
ready, in M ontre al, or not fa r away.  And the s e  
relatives would be t here  to e xpe ct 
the m and they would be
 arr i ving.  The tr ip 
on the Saint Lawrence  
River wa s a  very wonde r f ul tri p a n
d we  enj oyed i t .  Conti nui ng, we
 ca me fi nall y t o M ontre al, but 
the trip was very slow and instead
 of coming ther e in 
the a fter noon a s we 
had expecte d, we c a me  
there i n the eveni ng about  nine o'cl ock.  And there is
 a certain regulation that if a ship comes to port 
aft er ni ne o'cloc k, I don't know i f thi s is in all co
untrie s, but wer e there , i f a s hip c o mes a fter ni ne  
o'clock, then the passe
ngers can either depart, go off or stay 
on the boat until the ne
xt morning.  The 
other s, most of the  ot hers had r elati ves  waiti ng ther
e, but we didn't know any
one i n M ontr eal and s o  
we pr e ferre d to stay on t h e boat .  Ne xt  mor ning, 
we got rea dy t o dise mbar
k and the man ca me aga i n 
fr om the, fr om the JIAS, it's ca
lled, the Jewish 
Immi grant Aid Society and he
 said to us  he  would 
take us and he would fi rst bring us
 to a little hotel, not hotel, to a 
little restaurant 
for breakfast and 
then he would bring us  strai ght
 to the train station 
and where we would le
ave by train t o our  
desti nati on.  Our desti na tion was Yorktown, Sa s k
atc he wa n, t hat 's where our cousi n wa s li ving.  

However , it wa s a Fri da y  mo rni ng a n d we wante d  to st
ay i n Montreal i f at a
ll possible, at least over  
the Sabbat h and we aske d hi m, so he said no, that 
can't be done, be cause we 
have stric t  order s fro m  

the Ca na dia n governme nt, that  all  
the re fuge es , greenhor ns , t h ey a re calle d at t hat  ti me , gre enhor ns,

I don't know fr om where the name
 gr eenhor n comes.  Ma ybe gree n as
 the ____ is gree n.  So wha t  
happe ned?   So the  gr ee nhor ns ha ve 
fi rst to be, have, cannot stay wh er
e t he y  want  to sta y , they must  
go to their destination, because ther e's an affidavit  
that these peopl e guaranteed that they woul d take  
care of t hem and the gove
rnme nt will not take care of them, 
t h e Cana dia n governme nt  did not  want  
to take care of them, they
 jus t  want e d the m out as muc h a s pos sibl e, bec ause Cana da  wa s not s o 
fri endly to t he gree nhor ns, beca
use  I  know about  inter n me nt ca mp
s in Ca nada, where people from 
England wer e sent to and stayed 
t here  for ma ny ye ars.  Oka y, s o my father and we, a nd we chil dre n, 
all left a nd he brought us  to a s mall re staur ant an
d we had bre a k fast there a nd the n he brought us to 
the train station.  Now 
the trai n i n Canada at t hat ti me 
wa s a Ca nadi a n Paci fic  Tr ain, railr oad  
company I think it was and 
it was a small shack, I wouldn't call it mo
re than a shack.  It  was a small  
shac k a nd it wa s in June, on J une 15
th and it was very ho
t i n Ca nada, we ne ver ha d s uch heat be for e  
in Germany, was very hotand winter's very 
cold, summer's 
very hot.  An
d we were s
itting there and  
he, I  don't know i f he ga ve us a ti cke t , or some
how we stayed there, it wa
s  about 10 o'c l ock in t h e  
mo rning.  So we thought 
of how, what can we do 
in order to remain in Mo
n t real, s o we r e me mbe r ed  
one t hing, that we ha d writ ten t o relati ves  
in Montre al, my fat h er had a c ousi n fro m  
Ekatarinaslav(ph) in Russia, wh
o was a tailor and who had mo ved 
to Montreal an
d we had written 
them, but the letter had come
 bac k t o  Ger ma ny, a ddr
e sse e not  found.  So we  sai d, ma ybe  he 's , he 's  
still living there, my father said 
and he was sure that he
 was still living.  Ma
ybe we can 
fi nd out, but 
ho w can  we  fi nd  o ut?   S o a bo ut 
10:30 I think it was, th
er e was a desk in the 
train station and two 
nuns c a me i n, bec aus e Cana da, Que b ec is  Catholi c, yo
u se e a n d t wo nuns  c a me in a nd t hey put on a  

light a nd t he  light s aid, t r avele r 's aid.  So my fat h
er sai d, " M aybe the se nuns can fi nd out i f t his  
fa mily's still living here."  So he went over to
 the nuns , but t he nuns di
dn't speak English and we 
didn't speak French.  So what language are you 
spea ki ng i n.  So t hey kne w Russia n, my fat her

spoke Russian to them and he told th
em that we think 
ther e i s a famil y li ving 
here, if they knew that 
we would be here , the y would c ertai nly ta ke us 
i n and we woul dn't ha ve
 to go to Yorktown(ph),  
Sas katc he wa n.  So the nuns sa id, but  what 's thei
r  na me?   Said Ka pla n.  The r e are many Kaplans , 
come  to find out, Ca plan
 with a C, Ka plan with a K.  What
's t he first  name?  Burr(ph) Kapl an. 
Wh at's his profession?  He was a ta
i l or.  What 's his mothe r 's , his wi
fe 's na me?   Be be( ph) , I t hink.  
So t hey came and they t ook the 
tele phone book I think, or a ddre ss bo
ok that t hey had at t hat ti m e  
and t hey we nt through it  and they cal led up all 
these pe opl e a nd they call e d up a nd pe ople c a me to 
the the phone and t he y s aid, no, I '
m not fr om Ekatarinasla v(ph), I ' m 
not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera.  
So the y c all ed up 15, 16
 pe ople , t he n they calle d up so meon
e and there came a yo
ung boy at that 
ti me , of my age , fr om the phone 
a nd he sai d, I don't know, but I'll 
call my mother, so he called his 
mother , his  mothe r  sa ys, " Ye s, 
my  hus ba nd's na me i s Burr(ph) , 
he's a tailor, he came fr om 
Ekat arinaslav(ph), what  are you 
cal li ng about? "   The y said, " The re
 a r e some  pe ople
 who are clai m  
you are r elati ves a nd t he y wa nt to t alk t o you."  Ok
a y, s o ma de my father tal k
 to them and my fa ther  
right  a wa y r ecogniz ed hi m, he  see n
 hi m, he , not  he, hi s wi fe , they ha
dn't seen each other for , at t hat  
ti me I mea n, 15, 20 years  and she sa id, " What?   You're her e?   I have a son who is a pha r ma cist , hi s  
na me i s J ac kie, so I call  hi m and ha ve c o me  right 
over and we  take you in

wait ed about  15 or 20 mi nute s a nd t h
en he ca me  a nd he c a me and he 
t ook us all  and we went t o, we  
we nt t o th e Ka pla n 's  an d  we  sta y

Ca nada.  But, what happ
ened was this, in the me
an time, about 11 o'cl
ock, we  had received a 
telegram, I don't know how it came
 t o  us , it  ca me  t o the JI AS, probabl y, be caus e t he JI AS had se nt 
them a telegram that your refuge

We stern Union, I still have the cert

said to them,  
"Sta y whe r e you are , we cannot s uppo

aver age.  So I went to, I sai d to  
them, "Okay, what do I ha
ve t o do t he re? "  They s aid, " You ha ve
 to do this, and ha
ve to do t hat and 
you ha ve to be a ma n of ever ythi ng
, you ha ve to be thei r ha us en(ph)
 ca ntor(ph) , you have to r ead  
the Tora h, you ha ve t o te ach the m, you have to do 
ever ythi ng, for 15 dolla rs  a wee k."  I t hink I took 

it at that time, I said to
 them, "I will, I w
ill think it over", but in fa ct 
I didn't want 
it.  Then... 
Q: Now why di dn't you want it?  

A: First of all, it was too 
far out a nd was t oo ma ny things t o do an
d I wa nted to stay 
in the big city, I 
wa nte d t o st a y i n M ont rea l  or  so me other bi g city.

Q: And with your fa mily? 
A: Ye s.  S o  what hap pe ned i s
, my fat her found, in Montre al
, a not her cousin.  His  na me was  
Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph) and Fevel(ph
) Pastillnik(ph), he wa
s already a little bit ol
der, not too old he 
wa sn't, only like 50, 60 years old.
  So he came over t o us and 
he s ai d to me , " Y ou went  to 
Wurz bur g, t o the s e mina ry, as a te
acher, you see and you we re in 
_____, go to the United States. 
That 's t he only, because i n  Cana
da there isn't muc h Yi ddi shga d(
ph)," J e wi shness , "you go Unite d 
States."  And at that time, just at
 that time , they closed it.  Up to
 that ti me s t ude nts c oul d come very  
easily to the United States, but it 
wa s close d in 1938 or 1939, that 
you needed more than just this , 
you needed a reason, other 
things.  So, I didn't thi
nk muc h of i t  and I  s aid
, " What  ca n you do? "  But  
one day he called us up, this Fe vel( ph) and sai d , 
"I saw in a Jewi sh pa per, there was a Yiddish 
paper, written in Yiddish, it's for th
e Americana, the American and it sa
id on the front 
page of this," 
unfortunatel y I don't have that paper any  more, I 
had it for _____.  " On t h e fr
ont page of this paper  
is a big pi cture of re fuge e s, who ca me  to Ba lti mo
r e and some of t hem ca
me from Wurz bur g", fro m  
where I had studi ed, a nd he s aid he
 wants to show it to 
me a nd if I re cogni z ed 
any of them.  I had no 
intere st in that, but I sai d  to mysel f, " What ca n you
 lose?   Go to hi m a nd l ook at it."  So I we nt to 
hi m one da y, it wa s in August, I 
think it was in August
 and, and he showed me the pi cture a nd I 
recogniz ed a  fe w pe opl e on the se pic t ures , I recognize d the m.  Besi des thi s  I read the ar ticle and it 

me ntione d a  certai n Kali bar(ph) , Rabbi Kalibar(ph), 
not t hat Kali bar( ph) , relate d to t h e m.  And he  
said to me what I do is, what I should do is, I sh
ould write to this yeshiv
a(ph) near  Israel ____  
College in Baltimore, 
it's still existing.  And I sh
ould tell them about this an
d see what's happening. 
So I wrote to them, it's 
in here, and I got an answer right away and the answer sa
id, "We will accept 
you.  We wi ll accept you.  We  will 
gi ve you an affi davi t and j ust co
me in.  Go t o t he Consul and  
have it  ve ri fi ed."   Now at th
at t i me, to get per mi ssi on to go
 fr om Canada to Br itain ...

Q: To the United States. 
A: To the United St ates, 
wa s the Consul i n M ontr eal, t he Ame r ic
an Consul  in M ontr eal, he had the  
fi nal sa y, not the Justice De part me nt
, they di dn't have a Jus tic e De
part me nt yet, th
e Naturalization 
Department yet, that was 
only instituted later.  But 
go to the American Consul
 in Montreal.  I went 
to the Consul and it was a ver y nic e ma n, it was a 
Briti sh ma n, beca use at  that ti me , Cana da was not 
it's own country, 
it was a do minion
, British dominion. 
Q: Even in Montr eal? 

A: Yeah, actually, it 
was a British domini
on, it said here, a commonwea
lth, but it only became a 
country by itself in 1942
.  Then it was independentof Britain, but at that ti
me it was still dependent 
on Britai n.  So I sai d to t he Consul , I told them my stor y and he was very r eceivi ng, accepting it an d 

he sai d to me, " But you don't ha
ve a  valid pass port, number one , num
ber  two, it 's not  so eas y for  
student s to get to the Uni ted Stat
es now, number t wo, 
you don't have citize nshi p at all , you are not  
even a Canadian domicil ed person, 
because you li ved here less than 
six months, becaus
e we came in  
June 15t h a nd thi s was  Augus t.  You lived her e
 less than...  and you 
onl y gai ned citizenshi p,  
domici le in Ca nada, a fte r six mont
hs , so you ar e not domi cile d per so
n, so I cannot l et  you go."  I  
said, "But I promise that I 
will come back, becaus
e my fa mily is here."  He 
said, "Still."  So he said, 
"I will do something special," he sa
id.  "I will call my consul togeth
er and discuss it 
with them and  
then you c o me be fore t h is cons ul 
and they can make a deci sion."  So
 he ma de a , he call e d hi s pe opl e 
toget her , I  don't know who was his 
high offici als and I tal ked to them
 about the story 
and they sai d  
to me, fi nall y and the y, and t he y 
sent me out and then 
t hey c alled me bac k and sai d, " We made a  
decisi on, we  made  a deci sion that
 we will let you go, 
a s a  st udent , until  February, bec ause  you're , 
that me ans 60 days  be for e your 
pa ssport e xpir es.  Your pas sport ex
pires in April 21
st, we will let  
you go until Februar y 21st, under the 
c ondition that  whe n you c o me to
 Mont real, when
 you come t o

Baltimore, you w
ill have your passport extended
 by the Germans."  I said
 okay.  So I ma de the 
arrange me nt s, and s o I  had t he  per mi ssion here  now 
to go to Ca nada, to go
 t o Balti mo re, however ,  
how will I get there?  So
 I went again to the JI
AS and I had no m
oney and the JIAS
 gave me 30 
dollar s, I thi nk.  That was the a mount of the tri p. 
 I we nt with Gr eyhound 
bus from Montre al to 
Baltimore. 
Q: No w,  let  me  as k 
you a  coupl e of questio
ns  for the record. 
A: Yeah?  

Q: Wh en you said you didn't ha
ve any citizenship, maybe you can 
explain why you 
didn't have a  
Ger ma n 's pa ssport, why you wer e st a t eless .  
Bec a use  cert ainl y  you were  born i n Ger ma ny. 
A: I n Europe, especi ally in Ger many and all the co
untrie s, you ha ve t he ci tizens hi p of your fat her .  
My father was born in Ru
ssia and he was a Russian c
itizen at one time
.  However, in, 
shortly before  
the first Wo rld War I think, he came 
over to the , he ca me over to Ger many, to Bresl au a nd to ot her  
cities in Germany and he 
stayed there and he got married in 
Bremen, 1916 he got 
married and then 
he sta ye d there and he had, he 
was worki ng a nd he ha d hi s own 
bi cycl e busi ness and motorcycl e  
busi nes s.  And the n i n 
1921, 1922, 1923, wh
en Russia became Soviet Re
public  and they ma de i t  
law, I think in 1933 wa
s the final law, that an
yone who le ft Russia be fo
re it became the Soviet 
Re public , ha s to ret urn i n or der t o re tain hi s citi z e
ns hip a nd my fat her di dn't
 want to return to, to  
Russia, because he j ust  escaped be
c a use i n t he very begi nning of 
the  ce nt ury, they would capt ure  
the Jewish children and le
t them work for 25 years 
in the ar my, ca nt oons( ph)
 t hey we r e called.  So 
he didn't want to return
, so he lost his citizen
, he became 
stateless. 
Q: So te chni cally, how'd 
you st ay, ha d you been able  to sta y
 in Germany and yo
u ha d ha d a  c hild 
there , your c hild would have  be
en a Ger man citiz e n, although... 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
31 
 
 
Q: But you were... 
A: M y, all my fa mil y i s statel es
s .  Onl y i f you buy the Ge r ma n 
citi zens hip, be cause  there wa s a 
ti me , a t the e nd of t he 1920's t h
at you could buy t h e Ger man cit ize
ns hip for  50 ma rks  and they ca me  
ma ny ti me s t o my fath er 's  store an
d sai d buy, become a Ge
r ma n, but my fat her sai d no.  Ger ma n y is  
the source of all anti-Semitism, I don't want to be 
and it was good, b
ecause afterwards 
they took it 
away fr om them anyhow.  So he  
never bought German c
itizenship.  He remain
ed stat eless all his  
life and when we ca
me to Canada, they beca
me Canadian citizen, not 
I and when we came to  
America, I became 
American citizen. 

Q: So you a r rived in 
Baltimo re by yourself? 
A: Ye ah but there , b e fore
 I arrived i n Balti more, t here's somet hin
g els e.  I ,  all ri
ght, when we came 
to the border , to t he Ame r ican bor
der, they examined all my luggage
 a nd I had Tose fa Tor ah, whic h 
I spoke t o you be for e, with me.  The y di dn't know what it was, but I e xplaine d it to t he m.  So we  

ca me th en , t o Ne w Yor k , first we co me fro m,  we
 sto ppe d i n  Ne w York and we sto p ped i n Ne w 
York i n t he  mi ddle  of the ni ght , 11
, 12 o'cloc k at  night.  And my fa
the r  had t old me t hat he ha d a  
fri e nd in Ne w York, Ei s e man( ph) , whom he had onc
e save d i n Ger ma n y, he wa s in the prison and 
he had give n hi m an a f fi davit and he  wa s abl e  to
 leave Ger ma ny a nd he went to t he United Sta t es  

already, in t he 20's
.  And he had se nt us an a f fi davit  at  
that  ti me, we could ha ve gone t o Unite d  
State s in t he 20's, but  my mother  
di dn't wa nt to go beca
use she had all the relativ
es in Ge rmany.  So 
we mis sed up on that opport unit y. 
 B ut when I ca me t o Ne w Yo rk , 
I said, "I'm goi ng t o call up t his  
pers on."  I di dn't know ve ry mu
c h ab o ut Ne w Yo rk , we , we, at t he 
Ma dison Square Gar d en, I thi nk, 
we , the r e wa s a Gr eyhound st ation.  
So I calle d hi m up in t he mi ddle of
 the night, of c ours e, I didn't  
know very much.  So 
then I said I have to wa
it until the morning.  Then 
in the morning I called up  
agai n, six or seve n o'cl oc k now a nd a t  that ti me  th
ey di dn't , not  ever yone ha d a te lephone, t here was  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
32 
 
 
probabl y one tele phone for t he w
hole  apa r t ment  hous e a nd pe ople  ha d t o be c alle d a n d c o me do w n  
to that place.  It 's a lit
tle bit of history.  So I 
call them and I sai
d, "I s ther e a  Mr. Eise ma n(ph) livi ng  
in thi s buil di ng? " and t he  woman sai d , " Yes , yes t her
e are, I 'l l  call hi m, I '
ll call hi m."  And he c a me 
down to the  phone a nd he
 hear d me and when
 he heard me, he said, " W
here are you?   You are 
going to stay here fo r a fe
w days, I want you to stay
 here for a few days'"and he will come and see  
me .  "So where do you li
ve? "   This  Mr. Eis e man(ph)  live d i n 
Brooklyn and I was 
in Manhattan and  
I didn't  know t he dista n ces here , I t h ought ma ybe  in 
hal f a n hour he can c o me
 over , he  said, " N o, i t  
takes me a t  least t wo a nd a hal f hour s."  Long dist
a nces .  And it  was 1939, t hey had t he World's Fair  
in New Yor k at t hat t i m e,  I  don'
t know i f you re me mber . 
 So he said and he 
wa nts t o show me t he  
Wo rld's Fair.  So I waite
d there i n the Gr eyhound 
stati on and finally he ca me over , his wi fe  wa s  
home , I thi n k and hi s da ughter, t he y ca me a nd t h ey 
ca me  and they pic ked me up a t  10 o'cl oc k or s o  
and we we nt to a kos her  restaur ant t here a nd the n
 he took me to the ____
 and I st ayed wi th hi m 
ma ybe at lea st over ni ght , one ni ght , I don't re me mb
er any mor e how long a
nd then ne xt  mor ning, I  
continued to Baltimo re. 

Q: Let me  ask you a question.  Yo
u came to, fi rst to Mo
ntre al and then you 
were treated to the 
Wo r l d ' s  Fai r ? 

A: In  Ne w York .  

Q: Right .  Did it se e m at  all stra nge  t o you t hat
 everybody was enjoying 
l i fe and going, you know 
and cele brati ng a nd ha vi ng a good t i m
e, when so much, so much wa
s goi ng on i n Eur ope t hat wa s 
very di fferent? 

A: Yes.  And I for got  to
 tell you something.  When
 I , wh en  we  ca me  to , wh
en we  ca me  t o M ontr eal , 
I forgot to tell you someth
ing.  At that time I was 
still, in Jewish they call 
it the year of mourning, 
one year of mour ning a fter a parent dies or ____
_.  I was sti ll in the yea r  of mourni ng a fter my

mother .  I came t here, we came 
ther e in June, 1939, my
 mot her had bee n kill
ed in Nove mber, 1938 
and I we nt to the s yna gogue to sa y Ka ddi sh a nd 
I ca me t o t he syna gogue and I wa nt ed to sa y a  
certai n praye r  whic h we usually sa y i f s o meone is  saved fr om a danger, t h ey say a cer t ain pra yer , 
whi ch is c al l ed Gomel b enc hen( ph) , you s ee and th
ere were all people there and the y  said, " Y ou 
don't ha ve t o sa y t hat ."  I sa id, " Wh y not? "  "I
t ' s not s o ba d in Ger many."  Beca use ,  I c oul d not  
underst and, as I was completel y di sa
ppoint ed, t hat the pe ople here i
n, in Canada and in the United 
State s, did not thi nk it was as bad as it really wa s,
 because I don't know fr
om wher e they got their  
infor ma tion, beca use t he s e people , th
e se ol d men who were t h
ere and di dn't wa nt me t o say it , I sai d  
it anyhow.  All ri ght , they were no
t religi ous , t h at 's one thi n g, but 
they did not believe that it was 
that bad i n Ger ma n y a n d tha t  it wa
s Ameri ca t hat  we were saved, 
we wer e  far a wa y fr o m Ger ma n y  
now.  I c oul d not belie ve i t
.  And t hen i n Ameri ca al
so, they enj o yed the ms... 
[e nd of si de  one , t ape  t w o] 

A: So I couldn't unders t and the pe ople in A mer
ica and Ca nada , they were enj oyi ng the msel ves , 
wer e ha ving a good ti me , and t hat t he y di d not wa nt
 to belie ve , or di d not believe t hat it wa s so ba d 
in Germany. 

Q: Di d it ma ke you angry? 

A: I was disappoint ed, because I, I, I  saw everythi
ng, like mir acles happened
 her e, that  I had come  
out , we  ha d come out, that we foun
d relatives, that I was 
able to go to Ba ltimore.  They were  all 
mira cles , bec ause  I ne ver  thought of t h at. 

Q: Di d, did a lot of what you ob
s erve d s ee m frivol ous  to you?  
A: Yes , I think they did not feel
 with the people in Germany.  
I mea n, it wa s qui te di ffere nt i n  
Ameri ca at t hat ti me, even though
 America is nowadays probably the be
st  country to live in in the 
whole  worl d, but  it se e med to me  at
 t hat ti me at l east , t hat it
 was more a detached ki nd of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
34 
 
 
relations hip, that t he pe ople had with eac h ot her an
d not a ki nd of very c lose kinshi p relations hip. 
Bec ause eve r ythi ng went  like automa tically.  Busi ness
-like , more business -like.  And we ha ve , in 
our fa mi ly, I me an t hey'r
e talking about, about fa
mi ly li fe, but we had more a fa mi ly ki nd of 
relations hip, not onl y with the fa mil y, but wit h ot
her people, too.  The 
people who ca me fro m  
Europe still had this kind of re
lationship, to a certain extent. 
Q: Did you feel a responsibility to
 let people know what
 was going on in Germ
any and in Europe?  
Or  to warn t he m, to gi ve  the m i n for m ation?  
A: Whoe ver wa nte d to know, I tol d 
them.  I told the British Consul 
i n Ame r , in M ontr e al and I t old  
aft er tha t , the Ca nadian Cons ul, 
the British Consul in 
Baltimore, I told, also
 spoke about this, I 
talked about this and these peopl
e be more int er ested 
in knowing about it. 
 But the people wh o 
really should know about it,
 you s ee, t hey're  not so 
much interested in this. 
Q: Wh at ot her fi rst i mpressions, before we t alk
 a bout Balti more, what ot her first i mp r essi ons did  
you have of Ca nada and 
t he U.S.?   Do you re me mber?   I  mea n
, was  ther e a n y c ultur e shock, or?  
A: I kne w that, t hat first  of all , religi on was c o
mpletely different in the 
United State s and Ca nad a  
than it was in Europe
 or  especiall y in my secti on, even th
ough in Ger many, ma ny of t h e m or  mos t  
of t he m are  not  reli gious ,
 you see.  But here it wa
s also di fferent, as  I sa
id, it was  more , how do you  
call it, st yli sh.  That me ans , or ga nize d and no
t so, what we call in 
Yiddish, Haemish(ph), 
Hae mish(ph)  means havi ng a cl ose  bond r elati onshi p
, okay?   My relatives, 
I mea n my  fat her 's  
relatives, t h e Ka pla ns, you see , we re ver y, wer e  
very friendly a nd t he y 
ha d ____ this ki nd of  

relations hip, a war m rel at i ons hip.  But  in ot her circ les,
 it was just to a certain  point, as I said before, 
when I we nt  the syna gogu
e and I saw t hese people t here, t h ey
 more or l ess were
 for themselves, 
mo re or less.  Th ey didn'
t  care so much about  what  
wa s going on anywhere in 
the world at that time.   
And I t hink t hat wa s als o one of 
t he r e asons why t he Unit ed St ates
 didn't recognize 
what happened 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
35 
 
 
in Ger ma n y until  muc h l ater a nd Roose velt ha d a ha
rd time to convince them to, to do something 
about it, the Wa r Relief 
Fund and so, t hey came all  
much later.  I hope it's  
not true, but that was true 
at that ti me. 

Q: Wer e you able , once  you ca me over her e, to 
get any dire ct infor ma t i
on from Ger ma ny, fro m  
Europe, to sort of 
contin, follow up on wh at wa s going on? 

A: Whil e I  wa s i n, whil e I wa s i n 
Balti more , l et 's sa y, I wr ot e to 
relatives in Germ
any and I got a 
few answers, but al l these answers 
were ce ns ore d , beca use 
all the letters came 
back wi th censored 
by so a nd s o and s o and so.  And 
in the end, I didn't hear a nyt hing
 any more at all.  And some  
people i n Ger many gave me pi ctur es, I shoul d 
do s o met hi ng a bout it , but I couldn't e ve n do 

anything about my self. 

Q: Wh en you stoppe
d getting any information, di
d that alarm 
you at all? 
A: I kne w t hat ba d t hings were ha ppeni ng there  
and I knew it fr om some
 people, again from my  
orga niza tion, Agoutis( ph)  Israel , beca use whe n 
I was in Baltimo
re t here  wa s one ma n, who ca me  
ever y wee k from Wa shi n gton a nd he had cousi ns th
ere , he wa s my roommate, ne xt door roo m mate  
you s ee, ca me e very Thursday to 
go back to what, he ca me fr om 
Ne w York, exc use me , not fr om 
Wa shi ngt on, he ca me fr om Ne w Yor k and st oppe d 
over in Bal t i more and we nt to Was hington to do 
somet hing a bout it .  And he ha d ve
ry much information.  So I knew
 that what, that what was goi ng  
on, t hat it was not good and he wa s worki ng in i t , 
in this or ganizati on ve ry much.  I kne w thi ngs 
wer e not good.  But I kne w, t he wa y the l etter s ca
me to me  fr om Ger ma ny, 
from t he , indirectl y, I 
kne w what wa s ha ppe ni ng ther
e.  And they'd all try, 
insta nce , so and so is  on va cation.  That mea nt  
he was in the conc entr ati on ca mp.  Or whe n the y 
wr ote for ins t ance , we ha d to cha nge, that mea ns  

that the y dis place d the m  and se nt the m t o anot her place , you see .  I think once I se nt a 20 dolla r

mar k, whic h I had j ust how some  __
__, I ne ver heard of a gain, it was 
against the law, I sent it in an 
envelope.  20 mark wasn't 
really so mu
ch, but still. 
Q: So in your first several m
onths here, were you th
inking about the big picture or were you 
determined just to get on with your new life? 
A: No, I, there were t w o things , 
or three things.  Number one, I 
wanted to see i f I c oul d not get  
anyone out , but I ha d no mone y and the or gani zati on ha
d ver y much tr oubl e here , eve n in the Unit ed  
State s, be cause t hey di dn't want  to be  i nvolve d.  
Ameri ca got only 
invol ved in 1941 
a nd the t hing i s ,  
and, a nd, but  ever yone , e very re fugee , the  re fuge e s, 
they adored Roosevelt.  
Later on they fo und out 
he wasn't that, not 100 percent , 
be ca use whe ne ve r  he got s o mething 
to talk about the Jews in this 
conference , you s ee, he put it on th
e  bottom, he didn't tal k to it ve
ry muc h.  But on the other e nd, 
they didn't have a nyone else to ad
ore , so t he y adored hi m, pr et ty
 muc h a nd  they 
thought he wo uld

A: Yeah, di ffer ent congr eg

 1944, I wa s ordai ne d a s a rabbi 
and I  learned ther e many year s, 
wit h ma ny other pe opl e a nd during 
t h e war , I  ca n t ell you, dur i ng the  
war, even in the United States,  
I was consi d ered an ali en, what do t hey call it?  
Ene my alie n and I had to ge t per missi on to go fro m  
Balti more to New Yor k, each ti me, 
fr om the Attor ney General, it wa
s a woman, I went
 to her many  
time s, put a stamp in the passpor
t or so, s o met h ing li ke  thi s , ga

travel ed fr om Balti more  to Yonkers , near Ne w 
York, I also needed s p

nee ded eve r y ye ar, an e xtension of
 my pa ss port .   So no
w that comes to this 
poi nt.  All ri ght , t h ey 
had t old me in Montreal , whe n you c o me the r e, ge
t your pa ss port e xte nde d, yeah?   I go, I 'm t here .  
So I said to myself, wh
o ca n exte nd it , it  was  ma de  out by
 the Ger m an gover n ment, go t o t h e 

Ger ma n c onsulate .  At t hat ti me , 1939, yea h, Ca na

fi ft h or si xth of Sept e mbe r, Canada e n tered t he wa
r  at, on the  se vent h of Septe mber , Sept e mber , day 
aft er.  So I came t here, the Ge

eri ca was not  at war  yet, so the  
Ger mans stil l had t he consul ate her e.  But  I had 
no money t o go t here b
ecause it  was 15 cent s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

already at t h at ti me, a bu
s in Wa shington, Baltimore
.  In New York was fi ve
 cent s a  s u bway.  So I  
got t he money, I went t o  the c ons ul and I sai d to 
mysel f , "I have t o be ve ry car e ful when I go t o  
these  pe ople ."  So I we nt up the r
e.  So they, so it wa
s lunchtime.  I didn't 
know that they have 
lunc hti me i n  Americ a and that there i s suc h long l unc hti me a n d the y go out  and no one is there .  But 
there was someone ther
e, so I sai d to hi m I want e d my pass port exte nde d i f t hey c an e x tend it .  The y  
said, "Yes , leave t he pa s sport wit h us ."  I said to my
sel f, " No, I don't leave  anyt hing he re."   I take i t  
wit h me a nd said, "I come bac k a not her ti me."  I 
never ca me back.  I we nt 
to the Canadian consul, 
because I came fr om Canada
 and I s aid to hi m, " I  cannot get th
is pass por t  exte nde d, but I only have 
permission here until February 21
st, so if he cannot get perm
ission fo r me , ex
tension of the  
pass port."  So he sai d to me , you see ,  and this is
 interesting that he made
 a mistake and that save d 
me .  He  sai d  to me , a bout, he di d not ask me  a bout
 domi cile , he just  sai d I ca me fr om Ca nada a nd  
he gave me  per mi ssi on to st ay 
until  June .  Di d he  gi ve me  pe
r mi ssi on?   The n I  ha d no more  
per mis sion a nd he sai d he ca nnot give me per mi s
sion a ny mo re be ca use I wa
sn't i n Ca nada a nd he  
has no longer aut hor ity to 
do this.  So I go to Wa
shi ngt on and I tol d t h e m, 
"I ca me  here on thi s 
pass port tha t  cannot be e xtende d 
and I 'm st udying, I ca me  her e as 
a student and I cannot return to 
Ca nada because I didn't gain domi c
ile and I cannot return
 t o Ger many because t hey are at war" an d 
if I ca n stay here longer.  So 
he gave me , Was hington gave me 
permission for one mo re year and 
they waived my passport requirem
e n ts and e ver y year , onl y e very ye
ar I had to writ
e to them for 
another year extensio
n and that I did until the end of the war.
  And then at the end of the war, I  
ma de a, duri ng the war I ma de a request to bec o me a citizen.  It was 1943, but I coul dn't bec o me a  

citizen at that time beca
use it  was  the  hei ght  of 
the war, Stali n grad.  He 
sai d, "Did you do anythi ng  
for the war effort?"  So what coul
d I do, I wa sn't in the 
ar my, but I bought war bo
nds, but that wasn't 
enough, so they said, "No, 
you c annot bec o me  a c iti
zen now, but after six mo
nt hs, you can r eappl y."  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

So I rea pplie d again a f ter  six mont
hs and t he situa tion got bett er, th
en I got the FBI to help me and  
fi nall y, i n 1945, I got  what 's cal le
d f i rst pa per s.  At t hat ti me  th
ere  were fir st paper s and sec ond 
papers, now you c an right awa y bec o me a citiz en.  
Anyhow I had to wait five years in bet wee n and 
then in 1951, I became a citizen. 
 Wh en I became a citiz
en, I changed my
 name.  Wh y did I change 
my  name?  First of all, 
my wi fe  di dn't  lik
e this name, in the meantime
 I got married, 1948, so. 
Q: In Baltimore? 
A: Ne w Yor k I got ma rri ed, beca us e 
I  didn't tell you that 
after Baltimore, 
I we nt to Ne w Yor k.  So I  
said, this is a Russian 
na me  and people ca nnot pr
onounc e it a n d I c ut off t h
e be ginning and the  he ad 
and the tail, like, like a herring and I keep th
e mi ddle.  The mi ddle is 
Wein and I don't like one 
na me , one  sylla ble  na me s, so ma ke
 it Weiner, so they make my
 name We iner. 
 It's  in my 
natur alizati o n papers.  During the wa r, I tried to do many thi ngs .  I tried to be and I wa s eve n, ai r 

raid warden too, at one ti me , bu
t then they told me, you are an 
ene my ali en, you c annot be an air  
raid war de n, so oka y, I said oka y,
 _____.  Duri ng t he war , I also 
went to ni ght school t o lear n 
Englis h a nd I ha d a  very fa mous 
gove rnor  of Mar yland, who wa s a  tea che r, M c Kelton(ph) , I  don't  
know i f you hear d of hi m.  He was a tall ma n and he
 use d to sa y a wor d, he said, " Winne rs are neve r  
quitters, quitters are never winners.  
So go on with what you want to 
do, don't quit.  
If you quit, yo u 
cannot win.  Wi nners are never qu
itters, quitters are never winners." 
 So I liked that
 and many other 
story, but that's  not about this. 
 So I stayed in Balti
more and then in 1944 
whe n I  got ordi nati on, 
______, I ha d ma ny frie n ds

summer and so forth, I did t his 
all t here and I i nstit uted somet h

three things I 
instit uted t here because I thou
ght, it is in the Americanheir that they are a little bit, so big, at least it 
was at that time, to be a little bit mo

ed the people in the Ye

A: Because I, for t w o or three r
eas ons, number one , I 'm i nt ereste d
 in education an
d in learning 
more, like the perennial student, wh
o always  want s to l earn more a n
d I study a lot, 
with books and 
other t hings and I wa nte d  to bri ng 
the people cl ose r  toget her .  And, 
family life and, it
's mu ch e a sie r ,  
I wrot e in my book too, i t 's muc h ea si
er to lear n how t o hate t h an to love a n d the n to be t oget her a nd 
I know, there's so mu ch, so ma ny ba
d things happening in the worl d, with drugs, with crimes, all 
kinds of t hings, but we have to 
get in posit ive outl ook t o everyone
, we ha ve to do s o me thing whic h 
is positive, which helps to adva
nce.  Hate only brings
 you down and you have
 to bring something 
out , you see ,  whic h adva nces you, br
i ngs you cl os er toget her .  I like to know pe opl e and what ki nd  
of li fe t he y have and what kind 
of li fe they made for 
the msel v es.  And when 
I gave the m advice , I  
always gave  the m a dvi c e to do something positi ve. 
 I even tell them, if they
 are not successful in 
one subject , not t o st ay with it, 
to go i nto a nother one .  I had a  t
ypist once wh o didn't know how t o  
type , so I hel ped hi m into another job.  See, if 
you just let the m go and yo
u don't show a ny concer n 
for it , it  doe s n't  ca use  for  good relati onshi p. 
Q: How mu ch d o you th
i nk that  the c hoic e s you ma de  re fl
e ct ed your earli er e xpe rienc es?  
A: First of all, I saw the relations
hip i n my home  and also
 wit h my fa mily and I sa w al s o with othe r  
people that if they were close together , it was more succe ss ful and more helpful to them than if they 
wer e separat e or hating each othe
r or doi ng something whi c h was ne
gat i ve.  I don't really know 
anyt hing els e, it  must be  in t h
e ge nes  of a  pers on, you
 s ee, to do c ertai n t hings, I don't know. 
Q: I mea n, I have to thi n k that s o me of the c hoi
c e s you made aft e r the war ,
 your val ue syste m, had 
to have bee n  a ffe cted by your 
experience in Nazi Germany. 
A: M m-h m.  

Q: I 'm tryi ng to, a nd you've 
proba bly t hought a bout  this ... 
A: M m-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

Q: Some what, to try and get a sens e of how thos e earl y, very, very di ffic ult earl y experiences ,  
affecte d t he  wa y you a r e t
oda y, the way you bec a me , t h
e way you lived your life. 
A: Mm-hm.   When I left the school , the German sc
hool, I we nt to a  Ger ma n
 sc hool unti l  1936, t h e  
teacher asked us t o writ
e down what we want to
 do after school and why 
we want to do it aft er  
school .  So t here were t wo t hings which intere st  
me, number  one, I figur ed 
out i f I woul d stay in 
Ger ma n y, what would be possible, 
what would be ope n to me?   
There wa s nothi ng ope ne d to me , 
not i n t he non- Ger ma n world, only 
in the Jewish world.  
So  I decided to go to
 the  Je wi sh te acher 's 
se mina ry.  I n fact my te
acher hel ped me select 
that.  _____ number one. 
 Nu mb er t w o  wa s, I sa w 
ma ny pe opl e suffe r ing in Ger ma ny, Jews es pec i ally
 a nd, s o I thought  I wa nted t o hel p the m  

some how.  Bec ause t he y have , t he y  ha ve t he sa me  
fate, they have  the same fate that we have . 
That 's what I think it is, it mi ght 
be more, but at  this moment I ca
nnot think of a nyt hing mor e.  I  
mi ght  co me to t hink of more. 

Q: Wh en you mo ved over here
, wha t  did you s ee  as your  gre atest 
chall enge, as your diffi culti es, i f 
any?  

A: Be fore we move d ove r  here, 
we had to ma ke a decisi on when 
we wa nt  to mo ve a n d where we  
wa nt to move to.  When we
 wa nt to move t o I alr
eady told you, I want ed t o 
move when we are, still 
can work a n d do some thi ng.  I did 
not  wa nt to r etir e completel y .  Whe n I ga ve my r etire me nt s peec h 
in the Departme nt of Social Servic
es, I said to them, "R
etir e means to put on 
a new tire, to put on a 
new car eer.  Retir ement me
ans a ne w ca reer a n d pe opl e in t heir reti re me nt us uall y ar e more bus y  
than before."   Where 
we wa nt t o move to.  So my
 son, who lives in Ne w York
 state , I  didn't wa nt t o  
move t here , beca use t he y  have a lot of busi ne ss to
 do with t he ms e lve s, t he y ha ve their own fa mil y  
and t he y wouldn't ha ve a ny ti me  for  us, not t hat I  
wa nt people to ha ve t i me 
for me, but t hey're busy  
wit h the ms el ves .  The se c ond r eas on I didn't wa nt t o
 move ther e  is, the r e wo
uldn't be any chance for

me t o do s o methi ng el se, t o get a  job for s o me
t hing el s e.  Cle vela n d, 
my da ughter li ves i n  
Cleveland.  I didn't wa nt to mo ve
 there, t he Cleveland cli m ate is 
too c o ld.  So we move d here.  
That 's our younge st da ught
er , s he is here , livi ng here a nd I t h i
nk we c oul d give her s o me hel p a n d 
also here would be th
e possibility to get a
nother job and I got so
me other jobs here. 
Q: But actually what I wa
s tr ying t o underst and i s, i n your m
ovi ng not s o  muc h t o t he  Was hington 
area, but t o t he Unit ed St ates, yo
u know, a l ong, 50 years ago.  Wh
at , ove r the years do you think 
has bee n more di ffic ult or more 
challenging for you in te
r ms of adapting to t he American lifestyle.  I  
me an I know it 's  a  long ti me  
now, but if you can think back. 
A: Do mean that origin
al l y why we wante d t o 
come to the United ... 
Q: No, not why you wante d to 
c o me , but onc e you were  here  
and living here, wh at, do you 
reme mb er what ... 
A: Wh at wa s  most  d i ff
icult to adjust to? 
Q: Or most c halle ngi ng for you?  
A: First of all, there were alrea
dy i n Ameri ca at t hat ti me when 
we c a me here , the r e wer e alre ady 
groups of e quall y minded, e qual minde d Je ws, wer e
 alrea dy li ving he re.  Ther e wer e alrea d y 
congregati ons, certain pl aces and 
therefore it made it easier fo r me a
nd the refore I might be abl e to 
fi nd a job through them and I did.
  And there is mo re 
possibility and op
portunity here than other  
place s.  It  wa s not as har d, as  di ffi cult  t o fi nd
 conne ctions, se e a nd to st
udy and learn something. 
Q: So what you're saying
 is adjustment really 
wasn't that difficult? 
A: No, well , not  too di ffic ult here . 
Q: Do you think that there were certain events in 
t he hist ory of the last 50 years, t hat i m pacte d you 
or that you t hought abou
t in a di ffere nt way beca use of your
 experience i n Ger many?  Whether i t

wa s the Mc Cart hy hear i ngs or the Ci vil Rights move me
nt or e ven t he J apa nese i nter n ment ce nter s, I  
mean were t here event s here 
t hat  you had a  part icular, parti cul a rly s trong re action t o?  
A: Yeah, for  instance, as I  me
ntioned before, 
during the war... 
Q: You don't  ha ve  to be  s o cl ose  to t h e mike, 
but you ke ep tur ni ng your
 he ad a way fr om i t . 
A: Yea h.  Du rin g the war , that 
we  were considered enemy aliens, 
despite the fact that we were 
savi ng, t hey wer e not , t he y did 
not ma ke a di ffere n tiation bet we en t hose who c a me here  beca use  of  
their own pe rsonal perse c ution a nd t h ose who wer e act
uall y went al ong wit h th
e Nazi  system.  They 
didn't ma ke any di ffere nce here , the y just c onsi d
ered ever yone who came
 fr om Ge r ma ny i n the 
same category, the Japanese too.  
Tha t  wa s one t hi ng.  And t he n, 
after war ds, I mean t he McCarth y  
hearings and so forth, the un-A me
rican committee, see that it's no
t American again, not too much  
Ameri can.  I mean t hat was a, a 
le ft over , I  woul d s a y, fr om what
 the thinki ng was here in the 
begi nni ng of the 40's.  Is  mea ns that they very 
much belie ved in, in pure Ameri can a n d anyt hi ng 
whi ch c a me  fro m out si de of Amer ica, li ke Ru
ssia, and the Co mmunists
 and so forth, was 
conside r ed, you ca nnot live wit h 
it and you ha ve t o fight i t .  So
 I think, but then the people  
underst ood t hat the most 
i mport ant he re is act uall y to do some
thing for the countr
y, wh en Kennedy, 
wh en Kennedy came .  I don't know 
if this is the right 
answer , there i s no 
right answer to it . 
Q: That 's okay.  I ' m just sort of
 wondering i f ther e wer e certain even
ts over the years t hat had a ver y  
unusually str ong i mpact on you a nd, 
or that you identi fied wi th or
 that made you t hink in a ne w  
wa y?  
A: Oka y.  All right .  At one point, at  one point 
I coul d ha ve gotten a j ob, I was e ven offer ed a job 
already, in Portland Oregon, I wa
s offered a  job, i n  19, 1956 and I 
got the c ontra ct in and everyt hing 
like thi s and I thought eve r yt
hi ng woul d be oka y and I woul d be  able 
to do this, to go 
there, to start a 
school a nd c ertain ot her t hings and I disc uss ed it wi
th some of the friends he
re and some intelligen t

people , i f thi s is count ry t hat 's relia ble , i f I ca n beli eve it a nd t h ey sai d, " Y e s."  But wha t  happe ned  
is, I made already 
arrangements for the 
plane to go there and the cond
ition was, my condition, that I 
wo uld go there fo r three m
ont hs on trial a nd i f  I  like it , I sta y, 
if I don't, and fulfill the complete 
contr act , i f not I woul d come bac k.  But j ust t h
e da y be fore  I wa s lea vi ng, I was t o ld that t he y 
cha nge d thei r mi nd t here and t he y don't want t o ma ke
 a school t here, they 
want to ma ke some kind 
of a soci al progra m or who knows 
what ther e and I had alrea d y give n up my j ob, whi ch I had her e. 
I had t wo j o bs, I ha d t he  job i n the He bre w s chool
 and I had the job in th
e burlap factory.  And  
fortunatel y, the burla p factor y, t hey took me  ba ck
 right a wa y, e ven t hough I had c a ncele d with  
the m, the J e wis h school  did not 
ta ke  me  back, but  I di
dn't mind and the Po r
tland, t he  one who ha d 
signed the c ontra ct ga ve me 50 dollar s, whic h was  
not ver y much for the w
hole c ontr act , which t hey 
signed, so then I deci de
d, I 'm not goi ng i nto this
 field a ny mor e, beca use  
you c annot be lieve t h e m  
and I wa nte d to go on s o methi ng which wa s sa fer. 
  Then I found out a b out t he cit y of Ne w Yor k  
and I went  into t he Social  Work Sy
stem with the city of Ne w York. 
Q: No w,  wh en yo u said , a fe w mi
nutes ago you me
ntione d Ke nne dy. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Why did you?  

A: Be cause Ke nne dy, i n hi
s speech, especi ally t he fir st speech we
'd seen, don't do 
what the country 
wa nts fr om you, do wha t  you c an do 
for your countr y, you 
s ee, that pe ople sh
oul d work more for  
each ot her i nstead of agai
nst  each ot her and al ways expecti ng th
ings comi ng t o t h
em, you have to  
in, put some  input, you have to 
do s o methi ng and I wanted s o me in
put al so, not  all, t hat 's why I  
wa nte d to make my own school a nd 
my thi s and all ki nds of t hings.  
Some input, not just just on the 
receiving end.  Thi s is unfort unate
ly, natur ally, peopl e like to be se
rved, but that 's not how we can  
build up something.  So that's just the kind of
 input, and when I came 
here, for i nstance, that

synagogue, t hey di dn't have a cert ain class, so I 
instituted a class there. 
 Wh en I came here, they 
didn't ha ve a  certai n ki nd of infor ma t i on s he et, so 
I instituted an informatio
n sheet .  Wh en I came t o  
Wurz bur g, t hey di d not have a ne ws
letter all the time, so 
we instituted a newsle
tter and ____ to the 
_____ and we t old t he m s o me s t or
i es about , I woul d like some i nput.
  Giving some thing s ee, mor e  
givi ng tha n t aking. 

Q: Wh at, do you fe el, as 
a Je w, absolutely sa fe? 
A: Safe i n what r espect? 

Q: That, t hat  not , that 
what ha ppe ne d 50 year s ago woul d never happen agai n, t hat you ar e free fr o m  
anti-Semitism, whether ins
titutional or personal? 
A: You ca n never fe el 100 per cen
t  s afe, you ca n onl y, a s a n actua
l  thi ng, you cannot  be sa fe .  In 
your mi nd you ca n feel s afe.  You ca n say, I have  done
 what I do, what I 've  wa
nt ed to do and I ha ve  
done this and that's how 
it will go, it will be, 
it will be.  Things
 may change, things
 change all the  
time .  The only constant in this 
world is change.  So it 
will constantly 
change and I d
on't think that  
anti-Semitism will ever
 stop.  Because I see it, wh
ether it's in Israel, whethe
r it's all over, you see, 
there are al ways people who are ve
r y sel f-ce nter ed a nd t he y wa nt ju
st wh at the y wa nt  and  the y do  
whatever is necessar y in order to get  what they
 wa nt wit hout thinki ng a b out ot her pe ople , hur ting 
other  pe ople  or har mi ng or kil ling 
ot her people .  So ther e for e, I ca n 
only feel safe i n the way, what  
I 'm doi ng.  I f  you beli eve  in a  
certain thing, you believe in 
thi s a nd the n you fe el sa fe . 
Q: Do you t h ink that , that  Je ws nee d t o  re mai n vigil ant?  

A: Vigil ant?   Only s o ce rtain res pect .  Let 's sa y i f  
someone is a very fanati c,
 it woul dn't help the m. 
You can onl y be, be  vi gi lant i n 
your own approa c h a nd 
what  you are doing yours el f, not vi gilant  in 
respe ct t o, i n re gar d to other  pe
ople, that will not he
lp ver y  muc h.  Bec ause  one wa r bri ngs  upon 
anot her war ____, like it wa
s in, i n Ger many.  Fir st 
the war of 1870 br ought 
about the war of 1914, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
52 
 
 
brought a bout the war 1939 a nd so 
forth.  So one war brings  about 
another war, so to bring a bout  
peace you see, that 's actu
ally what our intent is, 
the intent .  Everyone tal ks about pe ace , but no one  
doe s a nyt hing a bout it, li ke t he we at her.  It do
es n't ha ppe n i n the worl d 
toda y.  We  have ma ny 
arenas of war and people talk
 about  peace and it  
continues.  In I srael , all  over. 
Q: We ll, let me ask you this, in
 ter ms  of hist or y.   You le ft  
Ger many i n  1939, you kne w i f  was  
scary?  
A: M m-h m.  

Q: You knew it wa
sn't getting better. 
A: M m-h m.  

Q: But I sus pect you ha d no idea wh
at you would learn la te r.  Th
at mu st have bee n  some what 
shocki ng t o you, yes?   I me an what
 would you, when you fi
nally l ear ned what reall y happe ned over  
there? 

A: You cannot always thi
nk of the worst, you, y
ou think something will ha
ppen you see, how much 
will happen, I don't k
now and then you have to be guided, like I did, by
 some principal which is 
basic , by some basic pri ncipal whic h you beli e v
e by.  I f s o meone has  a belie f, t h en he knows 
somet hing, t hen he , then he, t he n he
 feels s a fe .  I f some one  ha d reli gi
on, for insta nc e, he sa ys, this  is  
what I  ca n do, so muc h I  
can do a nd not more a nd the r est I  ma
y, I  ma y le ave up t o
 God or s o me one  
else.  I can do only my  
best, what  I c an do and every per son's  li
mit ed, c an onl y do cer
tain thing.  So 
I will try my best.  Bu
t then you really have
 to try your best. 
Q: But I think what I wa
s asking is, when you go
t tangible information 
about the atrocities in 
Europe, what was th
e  i m pact  on you?  
A: I felt ver y ba d about 
wh at was happening and I felt that so
methi ng ha d to be done  about it and 
the quest i on, who c oul d do s o met hin
g about it and how can 
you help, but it is not up to one person, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
53 
 
 
it ha s t o be a gr oup of people  
and be for e you cha nge  a ny pers on
's , be fore you can change any  
pers on, be fore you c an a sk a ny pers on
 to hel p you, he has t o have in
 his mi nd t hat he  wa nts t o hel p, 
really.  So you ha ve to 
fi nd out what is in his mi
nd, you know a nd by tal kin
g t o t he m and how ba d i t  
is.  Many people didn
't believe it.  And I see 
it many times, there are 
still people to
day who don't  
belie ve it .  Peopl e only
 believe it if it hurts themself, if it hits
 themself, hits them 
or their fa mily.  So  
there fore , I t hink the mos t i mport ant t hing is e duc
ation and therefore I was al
ways i n the educati ona l  
field, I wanted to be i n  the ed
ucati onal fi eld, becau
se the work educat i
on means t o bri ng out  
______.  Not revol ution by 
for ce, but  to bring it out for ot he
r pers on, ever y pers on has  somethi n g  
uni que  in the ms el f, whi ch ot her per son 
does n't  ha ve  and bring t h is out. 
Q: Was ther e a sense of celebr ation or
 satisfa ction in the birth of Israel
, or is that just something that 
you... 
A: It wa s a  mo ment ary  vict
or y, mo me ntar y, bec ause ... 
[e nd of si de  one , t ape  thr ee ]  
Q: What  we wer e , yo u k no w,  I wa s 
j ust a ski ng you about I sr ael a
nd you... Let me  as k you, I mea n 
clearl y your  religi on has  always  be en i mport ant to 
you.  Do you thi nk that 
i t hel ps you get t hrough 
hard ti me s, or that  it  a ffe c t ed t he  way you li ved your li fe?  
A: I think it helped me lo
t of times and I also think that it help
ed me, not t o get t oo i nvolve d or t oo  
much engrossed in th
inking that this is very go
od, it wouldn't change.  Ther
e is still, there is still 
things that will change and not that this is a fi na
l answer, like what they ar
e doing now in Israel?  I 
don't think that will be the fi
nal answer.  There's a progress 
going on, life is
 movement, it 
continuously moves.  It wa s good 
at  that ti me, for inst ance, t h at 
many people nee ded s o mepl ace to  
live and t his  was pr ovi de d.  But , as
 they sa w in German, that the mo
st pi ous  person c annot li ve  in

peace if the evil nei ghbor doesn't  wa
nt it.  That 's what Goyt er (ph) sa
i d, he was a great Ger man poet . 
So you ha ve  to li ve wi th other s t ogether 
and so metimes the ot hers
 don't wa nt peace. 
Q: Wh en you were living in German
y still and there was really a cons
tant fe ar of not knowing what 
wa s goi ng to ha ppen ne xt , did you pra y a  lot?  
A: You s ee, in the  be ginning, a s 
I mentioned, I only beca
me  mo re reli gi o us a f
t er my bar mitz va h,  
even though we kept
 chabiss( ph) t o a certai n extent and my 
mother ke pt kos her food, house hol d, but  
in was n 't s uc h a pr oble m,  you see , we  didn't  thi nk 
of it so muc h, we though
t it would always remain 
like t hat.  Be caus e I had friends, non-J ewi sh fri ends
, we pla ying together a
nd we didn't  think of, s o  
much about it.  Neither did they 
think so  mu ch a b out 
it, the di ffer ence bet w een Je ws a n d non-Je ws, 
until  the Naz i s ca me  and ma de  it a  pol i
cy, everyone has to
 think about it. 
Q: How about after your Bar Mitzvah 
and ti me s  were ge
tting worse then? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: That you, whe n yo
u, did you pray for a  
sense of support or? 
A: No, I  sai d  the  re gul ar prayer

Q: Nothing special?  

A: No. 

Q: But you c onti nue d, you c onti nued t o pray a nd

order to give the m a kind of fe
eling you see , of a little bit more 
than some one else
, because l i ke  
honori ng your parent s, you r e
spect your older br others and si st ers. 
 But I di dn't ta ke a dvanta ge of it. 
Probably it made me feel 
a little bit, a little better
, I don't know, you see?  
Q: It ma y ha ve ma de  you a lit tle b
it more of an activist, of a lead
er, which it seemed like you were. 
A: Yeah, yea h. 
Q: Wh en you think back to
 Germany, are ther
e any images that 
still stick with you,
 that haunt you?  
A: As I  sa id, no I  di
dn't s ay it  but... 
Q: But now you will . 

A: As  you know, my wi
fe  does n't  wa nt t o ha ve a ny conn
ection a ny more wit h Ger ma n y a n d 
______.  I  s ay, ther
e were certain things in 
Ger m any whic h were very ni
ce, you see and we  would, 
and I  would like t o se e it, I woul d li ke , let 's s ay, 
fo r i nst a nce , g o 
back and see wher
e I was born and 
where we used t o live.  
I n fact  we once went to 
Ger many, sinc e, si nce  we i m mi grate d here, but  tha t  
wa s only one day, but I don't know 
what the Ger man mind i s now, 
but I remember one thi ng, that  
after the war, our neighbor, non-Je
wish neighbors, wrote 
to my father a lot a
nd they and I still have 
the letter s, in Ger ma n, tha t  they were good fri ends 
a nd the y are s orry for what  happene d in Ger ma ny 
and so fort h and of cour se they wr
ot e, al so said, they suffered a l o
t, but that's not comparable to 
what the Jews suffer ed, because an
yone else, even I tell most of th
e young people, t oo, anyone el se  
who s u ffer e d, i f  he would ac cept  the  Na zi polic y,
 would not  be perse cut e d
 an y mo re ,  Je ws wer e  
perse cut ed whether the y did or not  and it wa s a 
purpose , s o there f ore I 'd like t o know, what the 
German attitude is now.  
Wh en they asked me this question in
 the mu seum, you see, how I fe el, I 
ask them how do you feel? 

Q: Do you e ver dre a m a b out  Ger ma ny?   

A: No, not any more.

Q: When you did, wer e t here cert ain r ecurri ng i mages? 
A: It wa s o nl y d uri
ng the war t hat I dr eamt 
about s o me people I  kne w a n
d I didn't know wh at wo uld 
happe n t o t h e m. 

Q: Now,  your wi fe is also from Germany? 

A: M m-h m.  

Q: Be side s t he fac t  tha t  she 's a l ovel y, wond
er fu l, wo ma n, wa s the r e 
a certai n commonal ity, a 
certai n bond that you felt b
ecause she was al so a Ger man? 
A: No, because I met her when we 
were still in Germany, she did not 
remember this, but I did, do. 
Because when I was in Ger many an
d I wa s going to the Wur zber ger sc hool, to t he se mi nary, at o n e  
ti me , i n the l ast year, 1938, begi nni ng of 1938, t he y want ed a  foreig
n la nguage t o be taught a nd the  
que stion wa s, do you want Spa nis
h or Fre nc h.  The ma jorit y wa nt
ed Spanish.  Afte
r the majority 
wa nte d Spanish, t he y as ked, i s the r e a nyone who c a
n tea ch Spa nish.  I had 
had correspondence with 
Spain, a friend of mine, so I knew a 
little bit of Spanish, so 
I said, I'll try to gi
ve a Spanish course. 
So I was appoi nted t he first Spani s
h teacher in Wurzburg.  And in 
or der to ma ke it applicable and 
have people join this course, I gave a sample l
e c t ure in a bi g auditorium and s he was  one of the  

student s t her e.  She di dn't  even
 know that.  And then
 we met  again when we
 came to America. 
Q: We ll the reason I ask is that 
it see ms a lot of survi vor s mar r y su
rvivors, a lot of survivors fr om 
one ar ea in Eur ope, late r marr y somebody fr om th
at same ar ea of Europe and I ' m wondering i f 
there 's a l ogi cal rea son for that a nd why you woul
dn't ha ve ne cessa rily ma
rried s o me body who wa s 
Ameri can, or? 

A: No, t here, and a few r easons for 
it , number one , first  of all, pe
ople li ke t o marr y s o meone who,  
wit h whom they can converse, 
I me an, who is on their level a
nd maybe even intellectually, 
cultur ally and so fort h a nd when 
I came to New York, my  wife  ha
d a n aunt ther e who kne w thi s

fa mi ly, you see.  In
 fact  I kne w s o me , I kne w 
of a cousin of my wi fe 's
, whom I li ke d, but she  was 
killed in the Holocaust.  
And then one day when my
 wife  came here
, she made the contact and, so 
that 's, we ha d met  be for e  as  I said, but  not 
knowing it  and t hat 's how it  ca me a bout. 
Q: So it wasn't a matter of eith
er mo re comfort t here or less co
mfort with somebody who doesn't  
underst and where you came fr om 
and what you we
nt t hrough.  
A: No, it came , it ca me automa tical
l y, you know, it happened this wa y, j u st to happe n you s ee, it is  
true, you s ee , that  both pe ople t r y t o marry s o me
one who i s from t heir ow
n bac kgr ound or so, unle ss  
some one  ca nnot fi nd an
yone at all here and I know people wh
o are goi ng t o Ir an, 
or go to ot her  
place  and marry t here , but usual l y t h ey tr y to find 
s o meone .  Als o I li ke d her fa mily a nd t he fa mil y 
gave me  s o me , some thi ng, yea h, hel ped. 

Q: Well I guess, you know when
 you had talked about initiall
y coming over he
re and being 
surprise d tha t most Ame r icans were c lueless a bou
t  what wa s happeni ng i n 
Eur ope a nd they di dn't  
care and the y didn't e ven want t o know, it would s ee m
 to me that it might be 
logic al that  you'd wa nt  
to spend your time with people who 
had your same sens
ibilities about this. 
A: M m-h m.  

Q: You know, that's the thing 
_____ wa s tr ying t o  get  at . 
A: Yeah, yea h. 

Q: I guess I have one mo re questi
on.  Do you t hink the re 's any wa
y that the Holocaust coul d have  
bee n a voi de d?  

A: Not t he wa y in whic h the Ge r ma n gover n me nt oper
ated at that ti me.  Be
cause in the 20's, wh en 
they wanted to establi sh a de
mocra c y in Ge r many, _____ a de mo
crac y, most pe opl e  were not in 
fa vor  of thi s de mocrac y, 
or t hey di dn't care and t h erefor e, one 
governme nt  aft er t he other fell .  That  
was one thing.  Number tw
o was, the Treaty of Vers

d not intend to create a

Uni t ed Na tio ns, or wha t  we hav e  n o w
, i n the Lea gue of Nati ons.  Th
ey did not wa nt to, they did not 
wa nt to bring people closer, but 
t hey wante d t o s eparat e people a nd t he y ma de  di ffere nt c ountrie s,  
s mall count r i es, which di dn't exi st be
fore.  They made t his a country,
 thi s  a country, t hey made all  
different countries, before it was 
all united.  And all th
is enc oura ge d s o meone 
like Hitler to bring 
the m t oget he r  agai n a nd t o tell t he pe ople, you s ee ,
 don't worry about it, you 
are not tr eat ed well , t he 
Ver saille s Treaty di dn't treat you well and ther e '
s infl ation and you can'
t get anythi ng, no jobs , 
nothing.  I will bring the 
sun.  But he could only 
do this by having a scapeg
oat and he took the Jews, 
beca use t he Je ws are ve r y, ver y pa ssi ve in this way.  So there f ore, fr om t h is poi nt of view, givi ng  
hi m t he power, pe ople  ga ve hi m t he  po
wer, so that Holo
caust came about. 
Q: And the passivity of th
e Je ws, di d it  pla y i nto t hi s?   Should
 they ha ve r esis t ed more  str o ngl y?  
A: No, the J ews don't re sist, you s ee, the Je ws 
tr y to go al ong wit h the 
gover n me nt, whate ver the  

governme nt is.  In fact , e ven here
 in Ameri ca, aft er Tr
uman I think, they men
tion the name of the 
presi dent in ever y pr ayer . 
 Roosevelt  especiall y, Tr
uman.  After Tr uman, I th
ink.  The y did not  want 
to, t hey accepted whatever, whatever
 the government said. 
 Pr ay for t he wel far e of t he gover n ment, 
so t he y a cce pted it.  Wha t  shoul d the y  
ha ve  done?   What  sh
oul d the y ha ve done?  
Q: Is t her e s o methi ng wr ong i n our  te achi ng?  

A: I t  has t o  be  hone st.  The fir st t h ing t hat  ha pp
ened, what  Hitl er did, it 
was in education.  He 
changed the, all the pictures in
 t he books of the ki nder gart en a
nd who knows what a nd put i n the  
Je ws wit h t h e bi g nos e a nd wit h hook a nd this  ki nd 
of t hing and such a pers
on you have t o hate . 
You can put  everyt hing i n
to a chil d's mi nd, 
a  c hil d doe sn't know the di ffe r ence  bet we en ri ght  a nd  

wr ong.  The y lear ned t hi s onl y muc h later.  So t he r
efore , i f a c hild doe s not  get the ri ght  infor ma tion 
fr om t he be ginning, eve r ythi ng go
es  wr ong.  And that 's why this
 _____ of t he _____ a nd ot her 
things, taught them wrong.  Ed
ucation is very important.

Q: But what  about our  educati o
n as Jews?  To ma ke us st
and up a little 
bit quicker? 
A: What should they do?  The Je
ws education does not , does not e m
phasize war or things of this 
sort, or ha te  or, even t h e Chris
tian religion you see, says love yo
ur nei ghbor li ke yoursel f.  And 
ma ny reli gi ons teac h, s ay this, but the  differe nce i s, we say a n d I don't know i f I should say it, but  

we say, that's a way to act, not 
that 's a wa y to t hi nk only.  Roose v
elt said it.  Ro
osevel t kne w ____  
onl y in mind, but not  in action.  Sa
me thing also with re
li gion you s ee , to love
 your  ne ighbor like  
yoursel f i n your mi nd, ye s, but in
 your action, not .  The a ction has t o
 follow wh at y
ou say i n your  
mi nd, i f not  so, not s o.  
So that 's what t hey have to t each t h
e childr en here, to real ly act , t o be  
toget her , to be frie nds wi th eac h other  and s o fort h, 
to ha ve more kind of re alistic s yste m, not j ust i n  

your mi nd. 

Q: Well , gett ing ba ck to your  sa ying 
t h at Jews as a pe
ople are passive... 
A: It seems so. 

Q: The y 'r e s upporti ve of their comm unit y or thei r 
governme n t, that t hey'r e pas sive .  Should we be  
less passive, should we  be more atte
nt ive t o what 's  goi ng on a nd act?  
A: Ther e are certain, in certain ar eas i n which you 
should not be pa ssive, but that I ca nnot sa y and 
ma ke ever yone re sponsible for , t h
at i s , there are certain l a ws, le
t 's say the  10 Co
mmandments, you 
see, they should be
 more active in those, not to
 kill, not to steal 
and so forth, you 
see, and just be 
more acti ve in that , not onl y the 
J e ws , everybody.  Be caus e what 's
 goi ng on now wit h the drug 
scene, wit h the kill ing a
nd s o fort h, they don't belie ve it .  
So, so ther e are certain, certain l a ws 
whi ch, whic h eve r y pers on s hould under sta nd, logical
l y.  And that t he y s hould te ach the m a nd not  
onl y te ach the m to think a bout t h
is , I  want t o, I don't  want  to 
pr ea ch here , you see, you se e. 
Q: I don't ha ve any other  questi ons, i s there s o me
thing you woul d like to add, that I have n't as ke d 
you?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425

A: Except , I don't know i f I ga ve you ever ythi ng, beca use  it 's i mpo
s sibl e , t here are t oo ma ny thi ngs  
to be re me mbere d a nd t o o ma ny t hings which ha ppe ne
d, but , if you wa nt t o bu
ild a world of pe ace ,  
that all people want to do
 now, at  least t hey say so, then, t hen 
we  ha ve  t o, the n we  have to gi ve  
everyone the equal opportuni
ty, but it's unfortunate th
at many time
s, as soon as some
one gets a little 
bit hi gher, he wants  the whole , he
 wants ever ythi ng you se e, people 
aren't  satisfi ed 
wi th a fi nge r, 
they want  the whole hand. 
 And, we wr ote onc e, an e
ssa y, we  ____ wrot e an 
e ssa y i n s chool, whe n I  
wa s in t he Nazi sc hool a nd t he 
e ssa y wa s call e d , Ger ma n l oy a lty.  Th e Ger ma ns we re a l wa ys l oya l 
to their leader, not only were they 
loyal to their leader, also they wa
nte d to be on t op of ever ybody. 
And they believed in the Da
rwin theory, the su
rvival of the fittest, we 
have to be the fittest, the  
Germans said.  Now if ever
yone thinks I'm the fittest
 and he will always s
ubdue other ones and have 
weaker ones whom he destroys and t hat 's what 
I want to end wit h.  Th
e teacher once, once aske d 
me , he  br ought  it out  in a cla ss an
d he said, "The Ger ma ns  a r e s upe
rior  a nd all t he  ot her r ace s ar e  
inferi or, be c ause  we are the stronge st , we are  the  
talles t , we are t he blondest , we  ha ve the  bl ue st  
eyes," and so fort h.  A
nd, and he said to 
me, thi s was a 
Nazi t eacher, " What do you t hi nk about it?" 
I said to hi m, "There is nothing in this worl d supe ri
or or i n feri or, everyone  can ris e t o a  high l evel,  
everyone can go low.  But there 
is one thing in this world which 
the Nazis don't r ecogni ze and t hat 's  
that eve ry person's di ffe rent and you don't real
i ze the di ffe r ence bet wee n one pers on, everyone  

contri butes somethi ng you see and you cannot pu
t  hi m down because he's 
di fferent and hi m down 
beca use he 's  di ffere nt in this way a nd he 's di ff
erent in that way."  Sa
me thing like happens in  
Ameri ca now.  Everyone's  di fferent , 
they can all  contribute and as l o
ng as they contri b, as l ong as 
some one t hi nks I a m superior a nd 
you are inferior, I am a maj ority
 a nd you are a mi
nority.  Once a  
pers on i n my offic e tol d  me , "The J e ws a r e not a  
mi norit y," he said t o me .  "Not i n Ne w Yor k, " I 
said, but ma ybe a not her thing.  So
 I aske d hi m, " Whe n does a mi nor
it y st op to be a mi norit y?   I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
61 
 
 
aske d hi m.  He c oul dn't ans wer t hat.  But so me
one's , if some one works un der the logical thinking 
that he's a minority, 
then he will always strive 
to be a majority, we always
 strive to majority and 
there will always be a fi ght
 going on, but the only time some one thinks I'm different
, I have certain 
things which you don't have and 
you have certain things which I 
don't have, then
 they will live 
toget her  in peace. 
Q: Okay. 

A: Acce pt it  or not . 

Q: Tha nk you ver y muc h .  You me
nti one d a Nazi school a nd I ' m wo
ndering at what poi nt you were  
in a  Nazi  sc hool?  

A: I t hi nk I made a mist ake, it shoul d not be call e
d Nazi  sc hool, but Ger m an
 s chool .  Because when  
Hitler came to power, all 
the previous directors and teachers we
re either asked to become me mbers  
of the Nazi party, or leave the school .  So the di
rect or in my school , wher
e I we nt, the _______, ha d 
been with the Social Democrat  
pa rty and he wa s  dis mi sse d.  An
d from then on, 
ther e were  t wo  
kinds of teachers, t he t e acher s 
wh o wer e  me mb ers o f  th e p a rty 
fr om long time  ago, the early 
numbers, all  the earl y numbers had 
priority or a later number.   Bu
t they came all in
 with the Nazi 
emblem, which was like a 
lifesaver and there was written NASDP
, National Social
ist Democratic 
Workers Par t y, that 's
 how they called themselv
es, with a swastika in th
e middle and 
one tea cher  
came in with a Nazi unifor m and 
whenever  a teacher  came
 in, t he s t ude nts get up a nd s ays Heil  
Hitler, when the teacher l
eaves the classroom, Heil H
itler, they all stand up.  
But that was, that was 
already be fore that t hey would st
a nd up, but t hat wa s res pect for th
e t eac he r, be cause you were , you  
wer e supposed t o have r e spect
 for t he teacher, the t eacher wa
s a hi gh offi cial  in Ger many. 
Q: So t his  was i n 1933 a nd di d yo
u, what, di d you st
and up, did you have t o st
and up to sal ute ____. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
62 
 
 
A: I  sta nd up, but I di d not
 ha ve t o l i ft the ha nd wit h the Hei l  
Hitler salute or the Na zi salute, but 
there was, when you came int o th
e buil ding, t he r e was a  tea cher st
anding and e ver yone whe n he  
ca me i n, would li ft his  hand.  I 
didn't have to lift my 
hand, but then on the 
other ha nd, some  pe opl e  
wh o didn't know it, would beat 
you up if you didn't do it. 
Q: Were you ever beat en up? 
A: No, not  for that.  But I 
tell you, I s aw a boy on a bic ycle , he 
met  a Naz i  a nd he li ft ed his hand a nd 
he fell from his bike, s o they sa id on the bike , you 
don't have to lift your 
hand, just make , sit up 
straight.  But this teacher came
 in and one of these 
tea che rs  who was fr om Str asbourg, Als ace-
Lorr aine , which wa s French a nd Ger ma n a gai n, he 
c alled me  over, his son wa
s in my  own, in my  
class, in my class, sa me class as 
I am.  He said to me privatel y, 
"You know, I am not
 actually anti-
Se miti c," he said, "but in order t o 
kee p my job, I have to put t h is li fe
 sa ver on," he s aid
 t o me.  And, 
and t his ot he r teac her I t o ld you about , he gave 
a c o urse i n Asse ncunder(p
h), it means knowl edge of 
the r aces. 
Q: And you we nt, yo
u took this  c our s e?  
A: I ha d to t ake it .  The  onl y thi ng is, a fter war ds 
t hey changed, that I di dn
't  go on Shabbat a ny more  
to sc hool , s o  this  teac her  wa s a n ol der  teac her , he 
wa s 65 at  that ti me , he c alled me ove r and he s aid  
to me, "If you don't come
 to school on Saturday
, I'm going to te
ach Hitler's Kampf,
 Mein Kampf, 
the book on Sat urda y, so you do, are 
not there .  And i f y
ou mi ss anythi ng, I will gi
ve you the, I will  
tell some student to give 
you the homework,"  see 
there, but still, some te
achers of, from the older  
class, you see.  But t hey had to
 be  me mber s, you s ee a nd i f yo
u ha d a nd i f not , they coul d be  
dis mis sed.  Now hi m they proba bly
 left, he wa s going anyhow, retir
eme nt age 65 t h ere, he left . 
That 's okay, but , but I hel p as a te
ache r , you se e, when he gave this 
ki nd, s o I aske d a que stion, wha t  
ma kes it _____.  Why does he know
 ever ythi ng?   So they ta ught th
at he has intuition that come s  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0425  
63 
 
 
fr om himself  Hitler does
 not believe in manifest
ation fr om above, becaus
e there's no one above 
hi m.  No God, no not hi ng,
 he didn't believe in Go d, even thou
gh he was Cat holi c.  So t here 's no 
ma ni fe stati o n fr om above,
 ever yt hing comes fr om the blood 
and s oil and it goes up t o hi m and he 
knows it by i ntuiti on.  What they ca
ll a, I forget alr eady the wor d in
 German, but it's
 something like 
a combination of blood and soil. 
Q: What 'd t h ey t each 
you in the race class? 
A: They taught me si mi l ar things 
and they al so taught me that  the 
Ger man race is superior.  Why?  
Because when God creat ed t he worl d 
in he  int erpr ets t he bibl e, but  
not the correct way of course, he 
created ma n and then they believe in Darwin's theory, 
that the fittest survive, 
only the survival of the 
fittest, so that mean
s the fitt est sur vive and we ar
e the fit test .  The Jews ar
e not fit, that's why they 
have to be er adicat ed.  And about this, what I me
ntione d be for e about infer i ority a nd superiority a nd  
which I don't believe in, I believe in the same thing, you see, but di
fference, differency, 

di ffere ntiati on, but I  don't  belie ve i n s uperi or a nd t h
is other  thi ng.  And fi na
lly, oh, not about that.  I 
wa s the only student of 700 in that
 s c hool, that  wa s a  bi g s chool. 
Q: The onl y Je wish st ude nt. 

A: The onl y Je wish st ude nt. 
Concl usi on of I nter vie w.
