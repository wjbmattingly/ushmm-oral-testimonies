A: I don™t really know. I know that eith
er his father or his grandfather was a 
dayan,

other in law and their brothers had wh at 
was called -- they were the -- one of the fi
rst people to use the trading stamps and 
they used to import tea, and in the teab
ags were black and white stamps. And after 
the people bought the tea, 
they saved the stamps, they 
came back to my father™s 
place and they traded them fo
r all kinds of things, househo
ld items, toys. It was very 
successful. And when -- wh
en my father realized
 what was going on in 
Germany
, 
he stopped all kinds of business with 
Germany
, and he used to import beautiful 
German baby dolls, and he st
opped this imme diately.

Q: And she came to the -- to 
Scotland
 wh en? 
A: She came to 
Scotland
, well, I believe prio r to 1897, because they  were 
naturalized in -- you know, so I don™t kn
ow how long they we
re in the country 
before they were naturalized, cause my si 
-- my  husband and I had to be here five 
years before we became citizens. 
So I don™t know

growing up as a child?

A: Yes, I did. As I said, my mother was 
one of eight, and so many of them lived in 
Edinburgh 
and we had a very larg e family there. 
Q: Tell me about the 
Jewish community in
 Edinburgh
 when you were small. 
A: The -- the Jewish comm
unity was very small, it 
was -- it comp rised of 300 
famili es. T h ere was only one synagogue, 
which was Orthodox, and it™s a very, very 
close knit congregation. 
Q: And were your parents active in the synagogue? 
A: My parents were always very  activ
e in the synagogue. My father was the 
treasurer of the congregation, my  uncle ac
tually was president.  They were a-also 
very involved with all of the -- the Jewish
 -- the societies. My mother was president 
of the Ladies Benevolent So
ciety and of the Zionist Soci
ety. My father was active 
in other ones, I™m not sure which ones actu
ally. But I think th ey were both memb ers 
of the -- the Scottish National Council of 
Refugees and -- and -- and of course it 
went on from there, be
cause from there we bro
ught in the 35 children. 
Q: Yeah, we™ll -- we™ll get to that in a moment. 
A: Yeah, I know, I know.

A: We were Orthodox. We -- they™re stric
tly kosher, you know, they  didn™t driv e at 
the weekends. It changed all our dishes at 
 Passover and we used 
to -- of course we 
went to all of the Jewish holidays and we 
went to services ever
y Saturday morning. 
Q: What was the n -- what is the name, or what was the name of your synagogue? 

A: It you know, I don™t know. I think it was just the 
Edin burgh 
Hebrew 
Congregation. 

Q: And where was it located? 
A: On 
Salisbury  
Ro ad  in
 Edin burgh
, about 10 minutes walk
 from where we lived.  
Q: What street did you live on? 
A: We lived on 
[indecipherable]
 Road.  
Q: And the synagogue was located where? 

A: On the eastern side of 
Edin burg h,
 near the King™s park. 
Q: Do you remember the rabbi™s name? 

A: While I was growing up, the famous rabbi was Rabbi
 Salis Daiches
. He was a 
wonderful man and my father was very, ve
ry close to him. He died, and when I 
married, I was married by a Rabbi
 Cohen.
 
Q: What kind of neig hborhood did you 
live in? Was it a Jewish and non-Jewish 
neighborhood, or strictly Jewish? 
A: None of the neighborhoods were really
 Jewish. It was a small -- it was a small 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

congregation, it was very scattered, and I wo uld say it was a non-Jewish congre -- 
non-Jewish community -- area, yeah.  

Q: And the friends that you had, 
were they Jewish and non-Jewish? 
A: Both, Jewish and non-Jewish. Mainly 
Jewish, I™d say, as I was growing up. 
Q: Where did you go to sc
hool as a young child? 
A: I went to a private school, it wa
s a -- it was a girl™s school called 
Saint 
Margaret™s Ladies College
. Had about a hundred  pupils in all. And -- and my 
sister and I and my  two cousins and my
 -- and my sister-in-law were the only 
Jewish children there. We were five ch
ildren in the -- in a school of a hundred  
pupils.  
Q: Was that difficult? How were 
you treated by th e other children? 
A: We were treated very well. The only thin
g that I remember is th at they had the 
prayers in the mo rning and we had to st
and outside the hall waiting for the prayers 
to finish before we could go in. 
Q: How did that make you feel? 
A: It didn™t really bother us. You know, we
 knew that we didn™t sing the hymns and 
that sort of thing, so we waited outside 
and we usually sort of chatted among each 
other. Then after the prayers were finished
, then we walked in and we had -- we

were told the general news that was 
going on. There was no 
anti-Semitism in our 
school as I remember it. 
Q: And what about the teachers, or were they all non-Jewish? 
A: They were all non-Jewish. My brother went to the 
Edinburgh
 
Academy, 
was a 
very prestigious boy™s sc
hool, and he either -- met with no an ti-Semitism. My 
husband also went to that school, and as
 far as far as I kne
w there was no problem 
there. 

Q: Your parents were active Zionists? 
A: Yes. Yes, they were. They 
-- they felt very 
strongly about 
Palestine
 and 
anything they could do to help, th
ey were always in the forefront.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. Did you go to
 Hebrew school after school? 

A: No, we didn™t. We had -- we had a Palest
inian student that us
ed to come to our 
house and teach us Hebrew, and he used to  teach us modern Hebrew, which I have - 

forgotten. 
Q: Do you reme mb er his name? 
A: No, I don™t. My brother, of co
urse, went to the rabbi for his 
Ba r Mitzvah
 
preparation and then the two boys that we ha
d, the two Austrian boys, also went to 
the rabbi for their 
Bar Mitzvah 
preparation.

Q: Were -- did your parents 
raise you to be independen t?
 How did they raise their 
children? 
A: They raised us to be independen t, 
but I think th ey woul
d have been very 
unhappy had we not dated Jewish people. 

Q: All right. Let™s start talking now about 
when you noticed a change. You said you 
were born in 1923? 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: So you were very 
young, of course, when 
Hitler
 came into power in 1933. Do 
you -- wha-what is your firs
t me mory of this man named 
Hitler
? Do you -- can you 
recall when that was? 

A: You know, I don™t really, but we went
 abroad on vacation and we were in 
Holland, 
now called the 
Netherla nds
 and we always went to Jewish -- Jewish 
hotels if possible. And we were in this -- 
in this Jewish hotel in -- I think it was 
[indecipherable]
 just outside 
Amsterdam
. And we were all eating at dinner and 
three men walked in and they
 looked round all the tabl
es and they talked among 
themselves and then they walk
ed  out again and we were to
ld that they were Nazis, 
looking for people. That wa
s the first that I rememb
er. A nd that was about -- 
perhap s about 1936.

Q: So y-you as a child weren™t aware be
fore 1936 that -- that conditions were 
changing at all -- were -- I mean, were -- or
 were you? Did your
 parents talk about 
it, did you -- you were able to read, of c
ourse, or listen to the 
radio. Did you have 
any inkling as a youngster? 
A: Yes, we did, and I think that we did mo
re than other people, cause of course my  
parent talked about it to us and -- a
nd we heard them sort of talking among 
themselves and I remember very, very clear
ly that my father 
had a book, and in it 
there were -- there were diagrams, or there were photographs of Jewish men in 

Germany
 that had been  beaten, and I remember that very , very clearly and it has 
stuck with me fa -- all through the years.
 So my  father was desperately concerned 
about wh at was going on.  

Q: Did you have relatives on th e continen t? 

A: Not -- no, I think that my mother had we
 didn™t seem to have contact with them, 
but I remember -- and my sister jogged my 
memory on this, that 
we used to see my 
mother tying up packages w
ith cord and with thick paper to send to -- to send to 
Riga.
 But I -- but I don™t know who they were
, and I don™t know -- and th ey didn™t -
- I mean, we didn™t hear anything about it afterwards. 

Q: When  you saw those upse
tting photographs, did you ta
lk that over with your 
parents?

A: My father talked about what was happening in  
Germ any
 and he was desperately 
concerned. He was desperat
ely concerned about the prob
ability of war and of what 
might happen to us. And he was very, very  
concerned to  the poin
t that when the war 
seemed inevitable, he and my mother dr
ove around th e country, looking fo r a house 
that we could live in and -- outside the city , because we didn™t know the city will be 
bombed. And th ey ev entually fo und th is be
autiful farmhouse 30 miles away in -- in 
the 
[indecipherable]
 in a village called
 Walkerburn
, and we lived there for two 
years. 

Q: Wh-W hen was that? 

A: It was from 1939 til 1941
. But they had been
 looking. And of course when -- 
when 
France 
fell, and they knew th
at the Germans were ju
st across the channel -- 
we thought it was a kind of an ad ventur
e, but he was desperately -- he was 
desperately concerned. 

Q: Let™s move backwards a little b
it before that. What about when 
Chamberlain 
went to 
Munich
, were -- did your parents talk about that? Does that strike any 
memo ries ?  

A: Oh yes, oh yes. 
Q: Ta -- please tell me about that. 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
11
A: Yes, it did, and my  father was very sk
eptical. He could see what was happening. 
He -- he mu st have had some 
kind of knowledge that othe
r people didn™t have about 
what was going on in 
Germany
. He could see what 
Hitler
 was doing, he could see 
that -- what was happening in 
Cze choslovakia
, and then when  he went into 
Austria
, and he just felt that 
Hitler
 was going to just run ramp ant unless he was 
stopped. And of course, he worried desp
erately about -- about the Jewish people. 
Q: Did your father speak German? 
A: No, no. My -- my parents spoke some Yi
ddish, especially when  they didn™t want 
us to know what they  were 
talking about, but not German. 
Q: And so he -- though he -- though he 
did not speak German, he obviously  was 
reading an d listening. 
A: Oh yes, yes he did. I mean, he -- he 
was a very, very  quiet man, but the th ings 
that he did, we found out afterwards, he
 -- he was looking out for everybody. I 
mean, he was the sort of person that afte
r he died, we found out that he™d been  
supporting the two -- two of my  mo ther™s
 brothers that weren™t doing well in 
South 
Africa, 
because they wrote to say, well why is it -- why has this stopped? And then 
we found out that he™d been
 doin g this, hadn™t told anybody. He was just great. 
Q: And how would you de
scribe your mo ther?

A: She was a lovely person. Un fortunately
, from when  my  brother was born, and he 
was five years younger than I, she was 
an invalid. She had problems and she had 
periods of intense pain -- this is
 n o t being recorded, is it, no -- 
Q: Yeah, this is. 
A: Okay . Sh e had -- she had gallstones. 
And ju st after my brother was born an d 

when she asked the doctors ab
out surgery -- now this was 
in 1920 -- I mean, ™28 or 
something, they -- th
e doctors, they casually said, oh,
 if anything happens to you, 
your children will always have one parent 
left, so she never had the surgery. And 
they got worse and worse and she suffe
red wi -- we never knew when she was 
having an  attack, and she was in intense pa
in. But she was wonde
rful, I mean, she -- 
as I say, sh e was one of the mainst ays of
 the Jewish congregation, and she was in 
the heart of everything, and as I say, she 
was president of the Ladies Benevolent -- 
the society. They were active 
in the Zionist So ciety, and then wh en  war came along, 
she was a member of the -- of the Scottis
h National Council of Refugees. And she 
was the one who arranged for th
e 35 children to come in from 
Dovercourt
 camp in 
England. 
And this was not easy because ther
e were only the 300 families and many 
of them didn't want to have the respon
sibility of taking refugees, but she found 
homes for all of these 35 children.

Q: All right, let™s talk about that. When eng -- when 
Germany
 invaded
 Poland
 in 
September ™39 -- September 1
st
, 1939 -- 
A: September -- yes. 
Q: Oh -- September 1
st
, 1939 -- 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: -- your parents -- did that cause a ch
ange in your parent
s™ perspective or 
activities? 
A: Yes, we -- my father was almo st certai
n that this was what 
was going to happen. 
He knew that war was inev
itable and by the time -- so 
Germany
 invaded
 Poland
, 
we were already in this house in the coun
try. In fact, we went there for the summer 
vacation. So that we were there, and I 
remember very, very clearly that Sunday 
mo rning on September third, wh en we sat 
round the -- at -- around the radio and -- 
and listened to 
Chamberlain
 telling us that we were at
 war. And so we decided to 
stay there. My school -- my
 sister had already graduate
d, and she was actually going 
to become a lawyer; that never happened. 
She went to wo rk and ev entually she had 
to do the war service. And she was -- a
nd she was sent to -- she was sent to a 
factory in 
Glasgow
, and -- just 45 miles fro m 
Edinburgh
 and she used to work  
there -- she stayed 
with my aunt in 
Glasgow
 through the week and then co me back 
at the weekends. I had one year to go in  
school. I was -- war was declared 10 days 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

14
after my 16
th
 birthday. And I should  have had 
one mo re year of school, and my  
school closed down . They closed  down  and evacuated to the north  of 
Scotland
. M y  
parents didn™t want me to do th is, so my  
schooling was finished. And of course my  -
- the brother also. And we went to live in 
the country for two y
ears. They went to 
the village schools there, the three boys, 
my brother and the two refugee boys went 
to the village school there, and as I say,
 my schooling was finished. After two years 
we went back to 
Edinburg h . Edinburgh
 itself was not badly bomb ed, but 
Edinburgh
 is 45 miles from 
Glasgow 
and in 
Glasgow
 there was 
Clydeside -- 
Clydebank,
 which was the biggest shipping fact
ory in the world. So the Germans 
used to come over practically every night to bomb th e 
Clydeside,
 and in doing so 
they came over
 Edinburgh. 
So we never knew , and I think we had about 150 air 
raids and we never knew  wh at was happ
ening and we always knew the Germans 
planes because they had a missed beat. Th
e British planes had a very steady beat, 
the Germans had a missed beat. You could hear them above and know wh at -- what 
they were. And my sister and I were both ai
r raid wardens and we
 used to go out in 
the dark and patrol the streets and see what was happening. 
Q: Let™s move back a little b
it in time about the young people that your parents, 
those 35 children, and especially the 
two boys, how did th at come about? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
15
A: I don™t know how my  mo ther too -- got th is all together, but we heard about the 
children in -- in the 
Dovercourt
 camp , and we heard about they were looking for 
families to take these child
ren. So  my  mo ther did he
r thing and went around and 
found these 35 families and they all said th
at they would take a child, and we said 
that we would take one boy. We said -- my
 brother was nine or 10 at the time. We 
thought a ni -- a boy will be nice for him. 

Q: Wha-What year was this? 
A: This was 19 -- the winter of 1938. And th
ey came in on a very
, very cold wintry 
night, I think it was in December 1938. 
Q: Wh-Where did these children come from? 
A: I believe they came from 
Dovercourt 
camp in 
Eng land
. I™m not sure. I™m n o t 
sure. 
Q: Now, were these English children, or 
were these children from the con -- Jewish 
children from the continent? 
A: Oh, oh, these were Jewish childre
n from the continent.
 They came from 
Germany
 and 
Austria
, maybe other countries, but th
ey were all -- they were all 
refugee children. And they came on the 
Kindertransport. 
Q: Right, and so  they were at this 
Dovercourt. 
A: Right.

Q: And -- and th en your -- your mo ther 
-- how did -- how -- what did she do, go 
knock on people™s doors? How did she get people to accept these children? 

A: She ju st about -- knocked -- knocked on 
people™s doors. I mean
, they knew all of 
the Jewish people. In fact, if I da -- a funn
y story was, when my sister was ma - - my 
sister was married a year before I was,
 and everything was rationed. Fo od was 
rationed, everything was rationed. So they
 decided that in order to have a wedding 
with a sit down dinner, they couldn™t -- th
ey couldn™t have very many people. Well, 
my  parents knew everybody in 
Edinburg h
, and th e people that hadn™t been asked 
were very, very upset. So I was married a 
year later, and we had a wedding in  the 
assembly r ooms in 
Edinburg h
, we asked 700 people. I 
mean, it was more of a 
buffet thing, but I™m saying this to tell 
you that they knew ev
erybody. They were -- 
because my parents were so 
involved in the congregation 
and because of this, they 
were invited to every wedding, every -- every 
bris
, a-and my father was, you know 
how you -- what -- if you™re a 
Cohen
 you buy back th
e child or something, is that 
right? 

Q: Th-The 
Pidy on HaBen.
  
A: Right. And my father used to go to a ll of these, he -- you 
know, and he went to 
every wedding, and every 
Bar Mitzvah, 
everything, so naturally when we had a 
wedding and didn™t invite them, th ey were 
very hurt. So we to
ok care of that.

Q: So you™re -- n-now we™re talking ab
out what, January ™3
9? Wh -Wh-When  are 
we talking about, the year your mo ther an
d father are taking -- taking responsibility 
for these 35 children? 
A: Well, I™m not sure when they -- when 
they started, but you go -- I™m not sure 
when  it all began, but I know th at the ch
ildren came in in December ™38 - 1938. 
Q: Oh -- okay, so -- so -- so this was after 
Kristallnacht -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and they were on the 
Kindertransport. 
A: Right. 
Q: Did they speak any English, these children? 
A: The ones that we had were especia
lly hard because the 
two boy -- when the 
children came in, we™d arrange
d to take one and -- and they
 came in this very cold 
night and there were these two boys that
 were standing hand 
in hand and nobody 
could understand them. They  didn™t speak 
German, they didn™t speak Yiddish, but 
they spoke this sort of dialect. So it was es
tab lished afterwards that the -- that they 
spoke this kind of 
sub-pa to is
, and where they came fro
m was, they came from a 
little tiny village called 
Lackenbach
 in 
Burgenland
, which was, I think, in 
north ern 
Austria
. So th ey managed to find out from somewhere that these boys had 
promised their parents that they would neve
r be separated, so we took both of them.

Q: How old were they and 
what were their names? 
A: 
Max 
was either eight or nine and his name was 
Max Kodigstein
, and his brother 
was 
Agon
, and he -- he was -- mu st have
 been  about 11 or 12. (Hey 
Jenny
, come 
on. We go. Go on. 
Yeah, scoot. Stay.) 
Max™s 
brother was 
Agon
 and he was about 
11 years old, and 
Ma x
 was a rather rotund little boy with brown hair, and -- and 
Agon
 was taller with -- with red hair. And th
ey were completely bewildered. I think 
that they™d never been  in 
a city before. And we had a
rranged a bedroom for this boy 
that we thought that we were getting a
nd lu ckily we had a double bed. So  we 
brought them in on this very, very cold ni
ght. The next day all of the -- all of the 
children were assembled at th
e shul and the particulars were taken, and then my  
parents, they took them down to the big 
department sto re and outfitted them, cause 
they were wearing 
lederhosen, 
thick, white socks and this 
sort of thing. And th ey 
stayed with us for quite some
 time before they  learned so me English and then  -- and 
then they went to the nearby school. 
Q: So how long did th
ese boys live with you? 
A: They lived with us for 
six years. They lived with 
us from 1938 til after the war 
finished, and then after the 
war finished we found out -- I don™t know how we found 
out, my  parents found out that 
there was distant relatives in 
London
. Their parents, 
of course, had died in  -- in the camps, but they had distant relatives in 
Lo ndon
, so

they went down to be
 with them. And after my father
 died -- and I™m not sure what 
year it was, but both  boys
 married girls down in 
Lo ndon
, Jewish girls, and my 
mother and I so traveled by
 train down  to both of their weddings. I lost touch with 
them when I came over here. 
Q: So th ese two boys moved in to your 
house and the other 33 went into other 
homes -- 

A: Right. 
Q: -- in -- in 
Edinburg h
. And did you have contact with these other children, or did 
your parents have contact? Did the children get together as a group? 
A: Yes, in fact, as I say , it -- it was a ve
ry a close community. Ou r boys actually had 
the two cousins, they went to
 other families, and -- and th
ey used to get together -- 
we used to have -- we tried to arrange
 things where all the children would get 

together so that they would 
feel that they were part of
 something, you know, that 
they weren™t th -- completely isolated. And 
-- and of course we all went to services, 
and -- and we used to have an 
Oneg
 
Shabbat
 afterwards, and the children were 
there. So they were very well treated. I me
an, I know that there were some families, 
unfortunately that thought that they were
 getting a cheap domestic. This happened -
- I think this happened everywhere, but in 
the main -- I know that we felt that we 
had suddenly got two new brothe
rs, and they were part of our family. As I say, my -

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

- my mother™s -- one of my 
-- my mother™s proudest th
ings was that she had one 
child -- one boy but she made three 
Bar Mitzvahs
. And it -- on this side of th -- you 
know, we lost touch with them. I have tr
ied through the -- thro
ugh the -- is it the 
survivor™s registry, to see if I coul
d find out where they were, but no.  
Q: And what was their state of mind 
in  the beginning, psychologically? 
A: They didn™t say much to us. They were
 quite bewildered and they were very, 

very happy to be part of a family, but I knew that -- I could hear the oldest one 
crying at night. 
Q: And what kind of connection or correspon
dence did they have with their family? 
A: None at all. None at all. When -- and 
they came to us, there was no connection at 
all. I -- since working at the mu seum, I™ve 
tried to find out about where they came 
from, from 
Lackenbach 
in
 Burg enla nd
 and th e interesting th ing was it looked as if 
this was a little Gypsy village. I really have 
wanted to look more 
on the internet, but 
so far -- come here, sh oot -- so far, I haven™t done so. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I mean they -- they had to be
 quite old now too, you know?

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Hilda Seftor
. This is tape number one, side 
B.
 
And you were talking about the two boys th
at came into your family, that came over 
from the 
Kindertransport 
and stayed for six years. Tell me about their 
Bar 
Mitzvahs
.  
A: I don™t remember much about them, I th
ink they were very quiet affairs but -- 
but we had the family there 
and we made a little -- and we tried to make a little 
party for them and I think they
 were very, very  happy.  
Q: When were the 
Bar Mitzvahs? 
A: I don™t remember. 
Max
 was, I imagine, nine or 10 
when he came, so I imag ine it 
was three years after that 
[indecipherable]
 and of course, 
Agon
 mu st have been 
earlier, because he was 
11 when he came, yeah. 
Q: Di-Did the children talk 
about their family at all? 
A: They didn™t talk about their family at all.
 We didn™t know if their relatives there, 
or wh at kind of a -- what kind of a life that
 th ey lived before th
en. I think that it was 
completely alien to what th ey came to. I think 
they lived in a ve
ry, very remote 
village and that everything 
was so strange to them that they couldn™t have a 
comparison. 

Q: How did they manage at school? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
22
A: They seemed to manage
 very well. And the other 
ch ildren, I think may have 
thought they were a novelty and they trea
ted them very well. They treated them 
very well.  
Q: And the teachers and so forth? They  we
nt to the same school that your brother 
went to? 
A: They went to the same school in 
the village. When we went back  to 
Edinburgh
, 
then my  brother went back to th e 
Edinburgh 
Academy and they we
nt to the local 
school, and did very  well. I me
an, this is 60 years ago, it -- 
Q: So when you -- when  they
 moved into your fami ly, 
you were in your co untry 
home, is that -- 
A: No, when they first came 
to us it was in the winter of 1938, and we were -- we 
were at home. That following summer we al l went out to our co untry home for the 
summer vacation and stayed there, and 
that™s when we went out there.  
Q: All right. Now let™s talk about the other pa
rt of your family™s life and your life, 
the -- the -- the 
Whittingehame
 part of your f-family s-story. When -- tell me a 
little bit ab out how this all began and what 
th -- how it came about and the lo cation. 
A: Well, 
Whittingehame 
is located on the outskirts of 
Edinburgh
 and it -- it all 
came about because Viscount 
Traprain
, who was the -- who was the nephew of L-
Lord
 Ba lfour
, who initiated the 
Balfour
 Declaration -- Viscount 
Tra p ra in 
was the 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
23
owner of this house and couldn™t afford to 
keep it going, he -- he couldn™t afford the 
taxes. And in 
Scotla nd
 if you can™t -- if you can™t pay the taxes, they will take the 
roof off your house. So  he came to the 
Jewish community and offered it as a home 
for children. And we were overwhelmed, 
and we were a small community , but we 
said yes, let™s do it, and my father went 
round the country raising funds for it, and 
then wh en  it was all decided that we could 
do it, he was made treasurer of this. A-

And both  of my  parents were governors of -- of 
Whittingehame 
Farm School, and 
what they did was -- excuse me. C an we stop for a minute. 
[tape break]
 
Q: You said something about if people don™t 
pay taxes they take the roof off of their 
hou -- the house tha -- th-the roof is removed 
from their house? Is that true or is that 
just an expression? 

A: No, this is actual -- this is 
the actual truth. Lord  -- Viscount
 Traprain
 had this 
huge house and it was a very, very  definite problem that they would take the roof 

off. And if you take the roof off, then
 they didn™t have to pay taxes.  
Q: All right. It™s an unusual story. So wh at -- now wh at year are talking -- wh at 

month and what year are we talking about 
that he came to your family and to the 
synagogue and offered this? 
A: I am not sure. It was, I w
ould imagine, round about 1938. 
Q: So this was before 
Germany
 invaded 
Poland
? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
24
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And then, when funds were collect
ed, my father was the one who was 
comp letely responsib le for furnishing th is as a school for the children and for 
getting all the equipment that they needed. 
And th en when this was done, they  hired 
a teaching staff. And because they -- the idea was that 
Whittingehame 
Farm 
School was going to  be a school that -- th
at taught a comp lete school curricu lum 
and also taught the children how to wo
rk the land so that if they went to 
Palestine
 
and were in kibbutz after the war, that they
 will be able to work there. And -- and 
the teaching staff was absolute
ly great and the first headmaster was not Jewish, he 
was called Mr. 
Maxwell
 and at times he wore a kilt,
 which the children loved. And 
once this was all done and this -- and the 
school was repaired and we bought 160 
teenage children up from 
Dovercourt -- Dovercourt 
Camp in 
England
, and -- 
Q: Who were these children? Were these other 
Kindertransport
 children like the 
fir -- the 35 that your parents were helping out? 

A: Yes, it -- these were all 
Kindertransport
 children, I think between the ages of 
14 and 18, though I™m not re
ally sure about that. 
Q: Mm-hm. And they came from a camp on 
isba -- on the coast, is that what you 
said, of 
Dover
? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
25
A: At -- at 
Dovercourt
 camp -- I™m not sure where it was in 
England
, but it was a 
big, very  temporary camp  for children who were first brought over to the country 
and kept there while homes were trying to
 -- were found for them. And they went 
all over. I mean, 
Great Britain
 was absolutely w
onderful in the -- in
 the fact that it 
arranged to take 10,000 children. It wa
s a small country and once we got them 
there, we had to find out who would take 
them. And they went to
 large homes, they 
went to small homes, they went to
 schools and so we heard about -
 Dovercourt
 
Camp , we arranged for the 160 to be brou
ght up. And they were there throughout 

the war. Actually, at a certain point, 
Britain 
declared that all -- all people not born - 
all people from 
Europe
 were enemy aliens, so the boys
 were taken over to an -- to 
interment camps.  

Q: When was this? 

A: I™m not really sure when. I think it must
 have been ab out, pe
rhaps 1941 
or 1942. 
Q: Okay, mm-hm. All bo
ys over what age? 
A: Sik -- over 16 years.  

Q: Let™s talk aga -- also about the financ
ial commitment your parents had to make. 
They obviously ha
d to make it for 
Agon
 an d
 Max
. What about for the school? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
26
A: Well, the school had to be su bsidi
zed by th e whole Jewish -- whole Jewish 
community. This was an enormous undertaking,
 so as I said, he was the treasu rer of 
this, and he -- he went throughout 
the country raising funds for this. 
Q: But when you say throug
hout the country , throughout 
Scotland
? 
A: No, I think it was 
England
 also. 
Scotla nd
 does not have a large Jewish 
community. As I say, there were 300 families in 
Edin burgh
. The --
 Glasgow
 there 
were several thousand, but even  then, I mean , this was not enough to th -- take care 
of this, so I think -- my father had business 
in some of the big E
nglish towns in -- in 
Leeds
 and 
Liverpool
 and other -- I mean, 
he had branches of -- of his business in 
some of the big town s, in 
Cardiff 
and 
Wa les, 
in 
Liverpool
 and 
Leeds. 
So I think 
that he went to the Jewish congregations 
there. I™m not sure where he -- he raised 
funds, but I know th at h-he
 went throughout the country. 
Q: And your mother stay
ed home with you all? 
A: Oh yes, yes. As I said, apart from 
anything else, she was a semi-invalid, and -- 
and it was not easy for her. 
Q: When  you say your father
 had busin esses in -- around the countries, wh-what -- 
the same kind of business 
that he had back in 
Edinburgh
? 
A: Yes, exactly the same, and as I say, he
 was in -- in partnership with his brother-
in-law, who was also called
 Cohen,
 although he was no relation. And his brother -- 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
27
I think th ere were about three or four of
 them, and it was the same b u siness, and 
unfortunately during the war, many of them were bombed. The one in 
Liverpool
 
was bombed, I think the one in 
Leeds
 was bomb ed, and -- and it goes on from there. 
Q: And this is the business where people 
came in with stamps and redeemed them 
and -- in your father™s o -- stores? Is
n™t that what you™re talking about? 
A: Yes, his business was call ed the Ideal Tr
ading Stamp Comp any, and as I said, he 
imported tea and then  had the stamps in th
ere, and then  -- and then  people wo uld 
redeem the stamps for merchandise.  
Q: And where did he import the tea from?  

A: I don™t know, maybe 
India
. I honestly don™t know. 
Q: S -- let™s t -- also talk now about this 
school. So the -- the 
-- these children came 
to the school at -- en masse, did they co
me as a group when  the school finally 
opened, when your parents got it go
ing and other people got it going? 
A: I believe it -- they came en masse, I 
think that some of them may have come 
later, but I think that -- they came en
 masse, y ou know, sort of -- mostly. 
Q: Mm-hm. And describe what these -- th
e set up was, how the children slept and 
so forth. And d-do you know, the physic
al layout of the -- of the building.  
A: They had dormitories -- it
 had dormitories for the bo
ys and dormitories for the 
girls. And there was -- there was an excellent matron, Miss
 Lacker, 
who was, I 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
28
believe -- I think she was Austrian. Perhap
s she was German, but she was a lovely 
lady and my  mo ther was, as I said, one of
 th e governors and she was head of the 
house committee and my mother used to
 have many, many meetings with Miss
 
Lacker.
 And, you know, sort of 
trying to  bring in a kind of family thing for the 
children so it wasn™t just a school. They  wa
nted to bring in  a -- a sort of homely 
attitude so that they would not feel so 
homesick. And as my sister wrote in her 
memoir, w h at -- wa -- one of the things that
 we used to do is, we used to go out 
regularly -- my father didn™t 
drive, but we had a chauffeur, 
David
, he was 
wonderful. But anyway, we used
 to go out several nights 
a week and my father used 
to take great cartons of ice cream and the 
thing was this, that some of the children 
were very, very Orthodox 
and there were two dining rooms there, o n e for the 
strictly kosher, and one that was not so ko
sher. And we used to take the ice cream 
out in a great big -- whatever yo
u call them? And it was ice packed 
[indecipherable]
 because the children used to have
 you wait for two or three hours 
before they could have the ice cream. And 
one of the other things is that where my 

father™s business was, right opposite was an  ice cream factory, and my father was 

very, very  fond of this man that owned 
the ice cream factory. He was it -- he was 
Italian and he was called Mr. 
Valenti
. And my father -- and ma -- and Mr. 
Valenti
 
used to get together and 
[indecipherable]
. The sad thing was this, that in 1940 all 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
29
of the Italians were rounded up in 
Scotland
 and th ey -- and th ey
 -- and they were 
put on this -- on this ship, the 
Arandora
 
Star
 and sent to 
[indecipherable]
 and th e 
aras -- and the 
Arandora Star 
was sunk by a German patil 
-- torpedo off the Irish 
coast and Mr. 
Valenti
 died. My father was very up
set about that, because he was 
such a good man. 
Q: Speaking about good men, which your 
father an -- ce-certa
inly sounds like, was 
he -- was he unusual in the -- in the 
Edinburg h  
community  or were there a lot of 
other men like him, who did so  mu ch and 
put so much effort and time and caring 
into these children? Or was 
your father unique in this? 
A: Well, I know I™m prejudiced, but he we 
defin -- he was definitely unique and he 
was -- he was one of a kind. My  uncle was 
a governor, but he didn't do half as mu ch 
as what my  -- my  father™s whole heart a
nd soul was tied up with this school, and he 
was constantly sort of trying to  find th ings
 for the school. Food  was very strictly 
rationed, and he™d  go around the farms lo
oking for eggs for them. He would -- he 
would try and su pplement the rations in ev
ery way he could. I mean, he was always 

there for them. 

Q: Now you were 16 - 17 - 18 - 19 at th
e time. You were obviously following what 
was happening and your pare
nts, of course were following wh at was happening 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
30
during th e war. What about the children? Were
 they also as awar
e, the children in 
the school? 
A: Oh, I™m quite sure they were. If you s
ee i -- if you see the pictures that the 
mu seum has, that my  sister provided, ther
e is a whole -- a whole group of -- of mail 

they were getting. I don™t know where 
they were getting it from, possibly from 
Switzerland
, but I me an, they knew what wa
s going on and of course, you know, 
we had air raids, which they
 were involved with. And 
-- and they had first -- an d 
they had first aid classes, you know, they 
were taught to do what
 they  had to do in 
case a bomb fell, this or this thing. They 
were -- they were very much aware, and -- 
this was a regular school, you know, I m
ean, it -- we knew they 
mu st -- it mu st b e  
so much heartbreak there, but you try and be
 there for them if they need it, -- but try 
and encourage them to 
go on with their lives. 
Q: S o  was it a me mb  --  a ma
tter of lay people counseli
ng these children, or were 
there any professionals there coun
seling these children psychologically? 
A: You know, I don™t rememb er that, you kn
ow. I was just a teenager myself and it 
was 60 years ago, so I honestly don™t rememb er that.  

Q: So what was your role with this sc
hool? As you say, you 
were 16 when  it all 
started, what did you do in  th -- in -- beginning th en? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
31
A: I didn™t do very much. As 
you say, I wasn't old enough
 to drive then, and I used 
to go out with my parents and make frie
nds with the children and do -- you know, 
try and make them feel comfortable. My
 sister did have her license and she w-
would often go out by herself 
at n ight and yeah -- and be wi -- I think it was about 
15 or 20 miles from the city, and she woul
d be there at night and she would be 
[indecipherable]
 with the children, you know? An
d she was the one that wrote the 
memo ir and she possibly has better me mo ries 
than I do, though wh
en I talked to her 
the other night she said, I don™t rememb er, it was so long ago. 

Q: Mm-hm. Ca-Can you describe what 
kind of farming techniques the children 
learned, you s -- had mentioned that they 
were learning that, agricultural techniques, 
in preparation for what? 

A: I don™t know wh at kind of -- 
the techniques. I know that when 
Whittingehame 
Farm , 
the estate was given to them, they were
 given the land with it, and with the 
farmers that worked the land 
and they took these childre
n under their wing an d they 
taught them the farming as th
ey  knew it. Now, I know th at 
the idea was that if their 
parents were not still alive when th
ey left, that they would go to 
Palestine
, and 
many, many did go to 
Palestine 
on kibbutzim -- on kibbutzim. But I don™t know 
what kind of farming. I know that I saw 
them on tractors, I saw them making hay, I 

saw them, you know, doing all th
is sort of thing and in th ese photographs that the 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
32
mu seum has, it also shows that it was espe
cially -- were taught how to sow fields 
and this sort of thing. 

Q: Did you have a sense that these children 
were coping well, or was there signs of 
depression among th e children, wh
en you would go out there? 
A: I really was too young, but thinking ab
out it now, I think that they were coping 
well. I think that the matron was a very nu
rturing person. I think that my mother 
was wonderful there, she was there to talk 
to them, and to be there for them if 
needed them. The other 
thing was just that 
Chaim Weitzman
, his wife was very, 
very much involved with it, and she -- 
Vera Weitzm an
, and she was out there a lot 
and -- and she worked 
with the children. 
Q: Did she live nearby? 

A: I don™t know wh ere she lived nearby, but she was always there. And actually, 

Viscountess 
Trapra in™s
 wife, they lived in the 
[indecipherable]
 house, and his 
wife was always there too, help ing. So  there was 
[indecipherable]
 and there™s a 
corps of women that were sort of there 
for the -- them if th
ey needed, apart from 
working in the kitchen 
and doing these things. 
Q: Did you sense any negative feeli
ng among the non-Jewish residents in 
surrounding areas about these Je
wish children being there? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
33
A: Abso lutely not, it was -- it was a build
ing apart from itself,
 it was set in the 
country, amid fields. But no, 
I didn't -- I didn™t see anything at all, or my  parents 
didn™t either, I know, because 
I would have heard about it. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And so how 
often would you go out there? 
A: We go out -- we would go out there a-
at the weekends and perhaps one or two 
nights a week. 
Q: Did you stay overnight? 
A: No, I didn't. No.  
Q: And the children picked
 up English quite easily? 

A: Yes, they did. In fact, th
ey did very well. As I say, 
[indecipherable]
 had a very, 
very qualified teaching staff. And after Mr. 
Maxwell
 left, they had a Jewish 
headmaster called 
Berner Cherig
, who now, I believe, is in 
Israel. 
And they  
seemed to do very well. In 
fact, one of the -- in one of  the photographs that we 
have, it shows the -- the girls 
all in the sewing room, and 
there™s a sign above it that 
says, speak Hebrew.  

Q: In Hebrew. 

A: In Hebrew, yes. 
Q: Were all the staff S cottish? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
34
A: I don™t remember. I don™t remember. I don
™t think they were 
Jewish, I think they 
were -- that they were regular te
aching staff, but I could be wrong. 
Q: Mm-hm. Now, what were you doing from the age of 16 on? 
A: Well, the two years that I was in the c
ountry, I was -- we had a very, very large 
country house. It had seven bedrooms 
and goodness knows how many bathrooms, 
and they  had the apple room and the gun 
room, and I mean, you name it. It was a 
very, very  sprawling farmhouse, and -- and th
e domestics that we had all went to do 
war work, so they -- there we  were in the country, my 
mother was an invalid, so I 
was looking after the house. And then, th
at time there w as no central heating, so 
you know, you would light the 
fires in the morning for he
at. So the first thing I do 
was light the living room fire, light the k
itchen fire, do these sort of things. I was 
looking after the house and I was -- I was 
very domesticated and I loved to -- I 
loved to cook, so th at kept me busy. An
d then  when we went
 back -- back to 
Edinburgh
, I was accepted into the -- the 
Edinburgh
 College of Domestic Science, 
and I was there for two years and I got 
degrees in household and institutional 
management. And institutional management 
meant that you lear
ned to cook for 
many, many people. In  fact, after I got marri
ed, and with four boys, and my  family 
used to tease me that I was still cooki
ng fo r institutional management. And so I

graduated from there and th en I was to
ld that I had to do work  of national 
importance. Well -- 
Q: Th-This would be 1943 now? 
A: Yes, possibly 1943. My sister wa
s already away doing work  of national 
importance, and I was told that I had to do
 this. Well, my moth
er needed somebody. 
We had a big house in 
Edinburg h
, no staff. So they said th
at I could stay at home. 
Th-They wanted to make me what they ca
lled a messing officer. This is a British 
phrase. A messing officer is a commissioned o
fficer in the British forces that -- that 
deals with -- with -- with th e catering, the cooking. Look
ing after the troops. They 
wanted me to be a messing officer and they
 said that I could -- I could stay at home 
if I got a job of national importance. So I went to wo rk fo r the 
Edinburg h™s
 school 
system, sort of cooking meals for the sc
hools -- for the Scottish schoolch ildren. And 
what I did was this, I had to be there at 
six o™clock in the mo rning and it was dark, it 
was blackout, there was no transportation. 
It was luckily abou
t 15 minutes walk 
from where I lived. And I get 
-- I leave the house about fi
ve -- I™d get up early, I 
would light the fires in our own house.
 I would wash the kitchen floor, do 
everything that had to be d
one so my mother wouldn™t 
do it. Then I™d leave the 
house at 5:30, walk to my  wo
rk . And wh at we had to  do is we had to work  with the 
food, so that the fo
od had to be ready by 8:30. Then  it was put in insu lated

containers and the trucks used
 to take it off at 8:30 to the various schools. And we 
were finished by three o™clock. Well, afte
r we sent the food out at 8:30, we began 
preparing th e food fo r -- for the next day. 
And during that time I got a vaccination. 
They  had smallpox in 
Glasgow, 
which came into 
Edinburgh
. And -- and without 
telling my parents I went to have a vaccin
ation, because for some reason I was not 
vaccinated as a child. So I went to -- I went
 to get a vaccination that was not good 
and I had a very -- a very swollen arm, 
and the doctor said, you™re wo rking too 
hard. So they put me in -- 
in the -- in the largest wartime nursery, it had a hun 150 
children. And I used to go -- I used to get 
the -- the tram car by 
that time, to this 
nursery and I used to go there and I used
 to cook for the 150 children and for the 
staff. And it was -- it was an old -- it was an
 old church run by an
 -- and ran by an -- 
and ran by a canal. And there were -- there we
re rats and this so
rt of thing. And I 
remember one year -- I lliked 
to knit. One year I made ab
out 20 or 30 pairs of mitts 
for the children, to th -- when -- for Christmas and one 
year they -- the Duchess -- 
the Duchess of 
Kent
 was going to  come to visit.
 Great excitement. And I had 
managed to hold some white flour, wh
ich was always, always unwrit -- 
unobtainable, and I made th
is wonderful cake. I mean, 
I made this absolutely 
wonderful cake and took it in there and th
e next mo rning wh en
 the Duchess was 
supposed to come, they found 
out that the rats had eaten part of it. So this was a -- 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
37
this was an experience. So I wo rked  th
ere and actually where I should backtrack 
and say th at when I went to 
work for the -- for the school
s, after I was there for six 
months they  say that would I be in charge 
of sending the food out to all the wartime 
nurseries in 
Edinburgh
, which I did. I think there we
re about 1500 children, and I 
used to send out the food to
 all these children. Then wh
en I got this, the smallpox 
thing, I h -- I went to work
 for the largest nursery. And 
finally my mother™s health 
deteriorated and they  said that I could 
stay home. And that™s
 when I started my 
volunteer work  and I went to work -- I look
ed after her and I went to work at the 
Canadian Legion Services club on 
Princess 
Street, which is the main street in
 
Edinburg h.
 And my  parent™s house was always
 open house for everybody. I mean, 
when -- I mean, for 
Pesach
, for Thanksgiving, any time. We always had lots of 
people and f-for our two Seders, 
-- we always had four or 
five or six servicemen. So 
we had open house and we always had 
many, many servicemen coming back, and it 
was very, very nice. I had a great 
-- I had a great childhood, really. 
Q: Let -- let™s get back to 
Whittingehame
 a little bit. 
A: Sure. 

Q: Did any rabbis come to the -- to the house
 to teach the childre
n or work with the 
children or talk to
 the children?  

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
38
A: That I don™t know. I™m -- I™m pretty sure
 that they mu st have visited and they  
mu st have come and talked 
to them. I™m not sure if 
they actually taught them. 
Q: Uh-huh. So there was no religious trai
nings? It was more secular, Hebrew, 
conversational Hebrew to get them ready to go to  
Palestine
. 
A: I think you™re right, 
but I honestly don™t know.  
Q: Mm-hm. Now, so mu ch was going on, obviously , with 
Hitler, 
we -- and -- were 
you and your family aware of
 what was happening to the Jews in ™41 - ™42 - ™43 
over in -- in the -- on the mainland? 

A: We were very much aware. Of course we -- 

Q: How -- how did you know? 
A: Well, news was getting through by this 
time. I mean, news were getting through 
by th is time. And of course, the children that came on the -- on the 

Kindertransport 
and our own boys were very mu
ch aware of how -- how their 
parents had been treated, wh at was happening
 over there. So we knew, probably far 
more than the non-Jewish p
opulation. So we did know wh
at was happening and it is 
a very tense time, you know, because -- b
ecause when , one by on
e, the countries 
over -- over in 
Euro pe 
fell, and we were left by ours
elves -- we were only 18 or 20 
miles from the -- from the Ge
rman troops, and -- and my father especially was 
desperately concerned about it, because 
you know, he - what were -- what was 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
39
going to  happen to us? Were -- were we 
going to be sent over to the camp s 
ourselves? It was -- it -- it was a -- I real
ize now, far more than
 I ever did when I 
growing up, what it must have been like 
for them, for our parents, cause I often 
think, wh at would I have done if this 
had happened  wh en  I had -- had my  four 
boys? And luckily -- I mean lu
ckily, but luckily, none of 
my family actually went 
and were killed, but we sa
w it all around us, obviously
. My brother was too young. 
Q: And when did the correspondence be
tween the children in the house and 
Whittingehame
 and their families stop? 

A: I don™t know. I have no idea. I mean
, I don™t know wh ere the correspondence 
came from.  I can only think that it mu st have come through -- thro ugh 
Switzerland
 
because when I was -- when 
I was transcribing it for the museum I -- I did a very 
touching series in which this 
little girl had been sent on the 
Kindertransport 
to
 
England
 and sh e was writing to her parents in 
Berlin
 and they were each trying to 
buoy each others up, and th
e little girl was saying, you 
know, what is happening 
over there? How are things with you? And 
th e parents were saying -- they had a 
guest house in 
Berlin
 -- oh, everything™s wonderful,
 this is happening, this is 
happening. And you could see. And then 
-- and then finally, when war broke out, 
the little girl said 
[indecipherable]
 said, what am I going to do, I can™t write to you 

any mo re. And I have this on the computer 
here. It™s a heartbreaking thing, but I 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

realize that from the ti
me that war broke out, that all correspondence, it did stop and 
that any that came through mu st have come by thro ugh 
Swit zerla n d
. So I mean, I 
don™t know where the letters came from. 
Q: Mm-hm.  
A: I know th at our b -- our bo
ys didn™t see anything at all,
 they were completely cut 
off. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And they started speaking with Scottish accents.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Hilda Seftor
. This is tape number two, side
 A.
 
Did 
Ago n  
and 
Max,
 the two young boys who moved 
in with your 
family, whom 
your family quote, adopted, ever
 come with your family after 
Whittingehame
? 
A: Yes, they usually came with us unless th
ey had something else that they -- that 
they wanted  to do or had to 
do. They came with us as pa
rt of the family. And I think 
that they liked to be
 with the other children, I thi
nk th at they gave a feeling of 
almost family, you know, that there were
 other children who -- who were not so 
Scottish. And it -- it worked out very well. 
Q: When  they would go, how 
would they talk to the child
ren, in English, or in 
German, or how would they talk to them? 
A: I think th ey would ha -- have to  talk in
 English, because I think that the language 
that they spoke would not
 be very easily underst
ood by -- by other people.  
Q: And t-tell me a little b
it about the high holidays a
nd whether the children at 
Whittingehame 
celebrated any of them, or othe
r holid ays, like Passover and so 
forth. 
A: The children definitely celebrated all of
 the Jewish holidays. I am not -- I can™t 
remember so clearly exactly how it was, but 
I know that my parents made sure that 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
42
there was a 
Seder
, that there were 
Seders
, that -- that the othe
r holidays that there 
were some -- there were some religious 
observance, so that
 the children would 
reme mb er their heritage. And sad to say I 
can™t rememb er who exactly went out to 
conduct the services, b u t -- but they were 
always made very, very much aware that 
they were Jewish, and wher
e they came from, and what their heritage was. 
Q: Do you know if any of 
the ch ildren kept journals? 
A: No, I don™t. We™re trying to find -- pre
tty late in the game but we™re trying to 
find children who might rememb er a-and who 
can tell us if they kept journals or 
not. I have some inquiries going out now 
as I™m trying to find children who were 
there. And so far I found one lady who now lives in 
New Jersey
, who was out at 
Whittingehame
 and she rememb ers -- she rememb
ers my parents picking them up 
in the car as a group and taking 
them to classical concerts in 
Edinburgh 
in the
 
Usher Hall
. Now, I don™t rememb er that, but when
 I talked to her she said that she 
always remembered my parents 
had taken them to concerts.  
Q: Were there any negative co
mm ents made by non -Jews in 
Edinburg h 
about 
harboring these children, taking care of 
them during the war? Did you ev er sense 
any of that? 
A: No, no, I -- I™m trying to  think. I didn™
t sense anything at all. I w as -- I was 
young my self, but I think th at had there be
en any negative, any negative or -- views 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
43
at all, or any -- any sort of sign of anti
-
Semitism, that -- that my  parents would have 
been aware of those and -- and th ey would have spoken  among th emselves. And w-
we listened to what they  said, but no, I didn™t hear anything at all. 
Q: And then  you said when  the law came 
about enemy aliens that the young men 16 
and over had to leave, what wa
s that like for these children? 
A: I think th ey were very unhappy, obviou
sly, that they were 
in they were th -- 
classified as enemy aliens, but this was the 
law of the land. In  fact, one of my  -- one 
of my uncles -- my mother™s
 sister married -- married 
an Austrian before World 
War I, and he lived in 
-- he lived in th -- 
Scotland
 all his life, in fact he was -- he 
ran one of my fath
er™s businesses in 
Glasgow
. Never thought of taking out 
citizenship. He™d been there 
what -- 30 - 40 years or more, and he was classified an 
enemy alien and he was interned. So I mean, all of the -- all of the men who were 
not of British birth and -- and who came from
 these countries, were automatically 
interned.  
Q: Did your parents have any communica
tion or relationship with these children 
from 16 on, once they  left to
 these internment camps? 
A: I think th ey mu st have done. I don™t 
honestly know, but I th
ink that they must 
have kept in close contact with them. I 
can™t see that they wouldn™t have done 
because they were so
 -- they were so 
[indecipherable]
 of making -- they were so 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
44
involved in making sure that
 these children knew that th
ey -- they were loved and 
wanted, and I -- I just can™t 
see that they wo uld have ju
st let them g o  like that.  
Q: Now once these 16 year olds
 and over left, did new children take their place, or 
was there just less children at 
Whittingehame
? 
A: It was less children.  
Q: Do y -- can you tell me
 a little bit abo -- more ab
out the other staff at 
Whittingehame
? You had mentioned some of them. 
A: Yes, the -- the agricultural side of thei
r education was under the superv ision of a 
Mr. 
Ma rkha m
, who  was L o rd
 Trapra in™s 
factor. Now, a factor, the -- the 
translation of that is the bailiff. He was -- he was Lord
 Traprain™s
 chief man who 
did the farming and -- and he took the child
ren, he took the boys especially under 
his wing and taught them how to  -- how to 
sow crops and do all the things that are 
necessary in farming. He was a great man 
and he -- he was -- he was very brusque 
but very, very kind, and -- and the boys
 liked him very mu ch. And the other 
members o f the staff was of course, Mr. 
Maxwell
, who was the headmaster. T h ere 
was Miss
 Lacker
, the matron, who was German and who was a lovely lady, very, 
very -- very warm and compassionate a
nd very competent at what she did. 
Q: This is a -- she was a German Jew? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
45
A: Yes, I™m sorry, yes, she was a German Jew. There was Mr. 
Drew,
 who was not 
Jewish, who -- who was the English teache
r and who was also the photographer and 
any of the photographs that 
we have were taken by him.
 We™re not sure of what 
happened  to  him after 
the war. There was a Mr. 
Likelbower
 from 
Palestine
, who 
taught Hebrew, who was Jewish. A Miss 
Trauss
, who was German and she was a 
cook and she was Jewish. And a Miss 
Mundy
, who was English, who was the 
school secretary and I doubt that she was 
Jewish. And I don™t kn
ow any of the other 
members o f the staff, but I think that it wa
s a fairly mixed grou
p, partly -- partly 
Jewish and partly not. 
Q: And did they all get along with each 
other? Di -- was there any friction among 
the staff? 

A: Not as far as I know. I think that the 
ones were hard and cam
e to work with the 
children were very, very mu
ch aware of what had happ
ened, of where the children 
came from, of how they must 
be missing their families and 
I think that they -- that 
they wo rk ed very , very  well togeth er, and I th ink the children appreciated that. 

There were so many cases of home sickness and -- and sadness, and a -- and I think 

that they tried to help in
 every way they could. Plus, my mo ther was there, Miss
 
Lacker
 was there and the 
Chaim Weitzm an™s 
wife was there, and they knew they 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
46
could go to them and talk to them if ther
e really was -- if there really was a problem 
and they needed to 
talk to somebody.  
Q: What happened if there was a health 
problem, if a child needed  emergency 
medical attention? 
A: I don™t remember that, but I™m quite sure
 that my  parents would have made sure 
that there was medical facilities th ere, al
so close-by that were available for them, 
because obviously there had 
to have been some kind of
 emergencies during -- or 
health problems during that time, but everyt
hing seeme d  to go 
smoothly and I think 
that if there were health -- 
health problems they had, 
th-there was medical there -- 
medical people there to take care of them. 
Q: Was there a bomb shelter on the property? 
A: I think th ere was, I™m not very sure. I know that the children were all taught in -- 

in first aid and what to do if a bomb fell.
 I-I don™t remember seeing a bomb shelter 
my self, but if not then I think 
that they must have been to
ld where to go in case of -- 
in case of an air raid. 

Q: W-Were there air raids? 

A: Oh yes. Oh yes, there we
re air raids. We were just -- the school was only a-a-
about 20 miles at the 
mo st from the city and we had ai
r raids in the city, so -- a-and 
then of course there were 
RAF
 stations -- Royal Air Force stations of -- the bases, I 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
47
think you call them, all around there, so 
-- and the Germans tried to bomb th em, so 
yes, we had frequent air raids. And -- I™m
 sorry -- and -- and of course, a -- the 
school had to practice strict blackout. A
ll th -- all of the windows had to be 
completely covered at night and a-a-a-at -- th
e same sort of things
 that we had to do 
in the city.  

Q: So th e staff that you mentioned stayed 
there at the school and were there during 
the evening and -- and nighttime? Who -- or 
-- or was there another nighttime staff? 
A: Oh no, the staff liv
ed there. They lived 
on the premises. As far 
[indeciphera ble]
 
as far as I was concerned -- as far as I ca
n remember, th ere was no other staff there, 
I mean, these are the people that were there.  
Q: Mm-hm. So they were th
ere with the children during the -- the air raids and the 
blackouts? 
A: Abso lutely yes, yes. And at one time I think th at a bomb  did fall -- I think my  

sister was -- was staying there that night
 and I think th at a bomb did fell -- fall on 
the nearby air force base and there was 
quite some consternation, but everything 
was taken care of. And the children knew, 
I mean, they knew wh at was happening, 
they knew the -- the da
nger of air raids and 
[indeciphera ble]
 during war time, and 
after what they™d gone through I think that 
they  were just prepared to do anything 
that had to be done.  

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
48
Q: And where did new clothes come from? Ob
viously, if they™d 
lived there for six 
years, the children got bigger, heav ier, so
 forth. Whe-Where did they come from? 
A: It must have ga -- the cl
othing mu st have come from a fu
nd that -- that the -- that 
-- that the Jewish communityprovided  for the running of the school. I think that -- 
that the -- the clothing mu st have been part
 of it and of course, all of us were under 

very, very  strict clothing rationing. So, I 
mean, it was -- it was -- it w as not so easy 

to get the clothes that you wanted . I think 
th at we all wore very functional clothing, 
clothing that would -- the clothing that woul
d last and that ge -- that we could wear 
for more than one occasion. 
So I think that the -- that 
the children were definitely 
well-clothed, but there was very, very sensib
le clothing. And of course, they all had 
-- as I say -- we all had ration books -- we
 all had ration books for food and -- and 
for clothing and for anything, so I mean 
i-i-it was very hard to buy things 
spontaneously that -- at that time. 

Q: What kind of activities did the children do
 for recreation there? After all, they 
were still children. 

A: I don™t rememb er precisely, but I know 
that they had -- they were divided into 
various 
[indecipherable]
 squads and -- and they had all kinds of games and they 
had play sessions, they had ga
mes. I™m not sure if-if they
 played -- if they played 
British soccer. I should think that they did, 
 I™m not sure. The girls played hock ey, 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
49
but they  all seemed to have some kind 
of very rounded educ
ation. Yi -- which 
included sports, and -- and phys
ical education, because these were very, very -- very 
sensitive years for thes
e children. They were growing 
fast and they had to have a 
proper education. 
Q: Mm-hm. Di -- was there any discussion,
 let™s say your mo ther or your older 

sister to the girls who 
were maturing physically? 
A: Yes, I believe that -- and I think that
 my sister was in volved with this. I think 
that -- that the girls would come to my mo
ther, and I -- and to ask for advice, and I 
think that they could talk to my sister. 
She was only two years older than I was, but 
she seemed  to be more mature
 at that time. T h ese are years of which I -- a couple of 
years can make a great deal of difference. 
So they were there 
for them, and I think 
that there were times w h ere some of the ch
ildren felt that they had a crush on some 
of the other children and I -- I remember th
at my mother especi
ally was there to 
kind of ad judicate what was going on. 
And it -- it was a community, but it was a 
happy community and the child
ren all lived and th rived a
nd after the war they all 
went their separate ways, and some went to 
Palestine
. Some, very few, found 
family and made new lives for themselves. 
A -And they all survived, a-and that was 
the most important thing of all. 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006

Q: Were your parents in touch with the ot
her -- the other 33, I guess, children that 
your father helped to place 
in different homes? Not the 
Whittingehame 
children, 
but -- 
A: No, no, I know, yeah. 
Q: -- did your father and mother keep up with those children at all? 

A: Well, yes, I mean sa -- 
mainly because they were pa
rt of the community. I mean, 
it was a very, very small congreg ation and i-i -- we knew everybody. I mean, the 
people wh o -- who had agreed to take thes
e children in were all -- I wou -- I would 
almost say some friends of my parents. So 
we kept in close touch. As I say, I think 
that our boys had tw o cousin
s, th -- and they were in 
one of my mother™s friend™s 
houses and this 
[indecipherable]
. I think my  aunt -- I believe my  aunt in 
Glasgow
 
took one of them. And my -- 
my mother-in-law, as it turn
ed out to be, 
she took one 
of them, so they™re all people
 that we knew and th ey™re all part of the congregation. 
Another thing which is nothing to do with 
these children is that when the refugees 
came into -- into 
Edinburgh
, I think my parents were largely responsible for 
establishing a refugee club for th em. And 
they  would -- they would find -- they 
would rent somewhere, a little hole or a 
big room somewhere, and once a week, or 
so -- twice a week, they could 
come together and gath er and just talk to each other. 
And we used to go to refugee club and talk
 to them and see wh
at was going on. So, 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
51
I mean, apart from the ch
ildren, they were also trying 
to help the grownups and just 
to see that they had some kind -- some ki
nd -- some kind of connection with each 
other, that they weren'
t so completely alone. 
Q: These were adult refugees. 
A: These wer -- yes, th ese were adult refugees. These were people that had 

managed to come in -- in fact, my -- one 
of the people that my  father signed an 
affidavit for was called Dr. 
Adler
 and he and his wife came in. One -- another 
refugee was the Dr. 
Schneider
, who became a very, very  good dentist. But Dr.
 
Adler
 became my  mo ther™s physician and yo
u know, my par -- my parents kept -- 
kept in close touch with them, which is ra
ther interesting thinking about it, cause 
I™m wondering if they had to sit exams befo
re they could -- if they could practice in 
-- but they  definitely did. And we had re
fugees come into the house all the time. 

And -- and my  father was constantly trying 
to  see what he could do. He knew what 
was happening, he knew wh at was going on
 and as time goes by we could see mo re 
and mo re newsreels and stuff of wh at was happening in  
Europe
. 
Q: Di-Did you know ab out the camps? 

A: Yes, we -- yes, we knew about the -- abou
t the camps. I think 
that we knew more 
than other people and just agonized about 
them. I mean, we were just so lucky that 
we had no close family members that were 
-- that were caught in there. And I think

that my parents felt this. I think they fe
lt that they were so privileged that we 
escaped this that they wanted
 to help the people that we
r -- that were so unfortunate. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: That™s why -- one of the reasons wh
y, a-as an aside, when I came to 
Washington -- 
came to 
Virgin ia
, I was so happy that I could wo rk fo r the mu seum 
and try an d keep on the work th at my  pa
rents were doing. It was the one thing I 
wanted to  do. 
Q: We™ll talk about that a 
little later. I know with the 
Kindertransport
 children, 
many of them were placed in homes of 
non-Jewish families. Were any of the 35 
children that your father helped place, place
d in non-Jewish families, or all were 
placed in Jewish families? 

A: They were all placed 
with Jewish families. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I think that a -- I mean, thinking back
, my  parents were comp letely involved in 
the Jewish community and I think that all of
 their friends really -- th eir close friends 
were Jewish. And -- the people that my mo
ther felt that she could contact and ask 
them, they were Jewish, and 
then she knew the kind of 
homes that they would be 
going to .

Q: So it was never necessary to then m
ove out into the -- in
to the non-Jewish 
population? 
A: No, I think th at -- thinking back on it that
 if they had they might have been ab le 
to bring more -- more children in, but it was 
a real feat to bring the 35 in, it really 

was.  

Q: And again, could you ju st go over 
how your father heard about these 35 
children? 
A: I don™t think he heard about them, I thi
nk that we knew that -- that -- that th ere 
were children being brought in on the 
Kindertransport.
 We knew that there were 
thousands being brought in and I think th ere 
was a -- there was a plea sent out to all 
of the Jewish communities, could they take
 people. I mean, he had no knowledge of 
who these children were, but it was just this
 -- this -- it™s a que
stion, can you help, 
can you take children. That™s
 what they responded to. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were there any Jewish residents who were negative about this, or was 

it all a positive response? 
A: Oh, I™m quite sure that some people said
 that they would rath
er not. I mean, I™m 
quite sure, I mean I don™t know, but I™m 
quite sure there wa
s some, really.  
Q: Why do you say that? 

A: Well, I don™t know, I mean, but thinki
ng back and knowin
g the nature that 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
54
there™s some people that would and some 
people that won™t. And I -- I just can™t 
think that everybody that my
 mo ther sa -- contacted woul
d say, oh yeah sure, yes of 
course we™ll do it. I™m quite sure there 
were people that said, hey I™m sorry, we 
can™t do this. 
Q: Because of the responsib ility, yeah. Is 
there anything more you can talk about, 
about 
Whittingehame 
during ™39 to  ™45 that we ha
ven™t covered yet, because I 
wanted to  then move on to aft -- you 
know, wh en the war was over. Is there 
anything else that you reme mb er? Were 
there any crises that happened at 
Whittingehame
? 

A: Not that I remember. No
 -- I-I think there was a -- a 
small crisis when -- when 
some -- so me girls sai d  they
 were heartbroken because th
ey -- they had this crush 
on one of the boys or something like this
, and -- and they™ll be some -- people will 
go and talk to them and, you know, -- and 
[indecipherable]
. Nothing really, 
nothing really. I think th at it -- it was a regular school an d I think that there were 
ups and downs and I think that
 obviously  -- perhap s some 
of the children were sick 
sometimes, but it all worked out, but very, 
very well. It was an excellent teaching 
staff and there were people there like the 
Chaim Weitzm an™s 
wife,  like the 
Maso ns 
or like my  parents, who were always th
ere on hand to be there if they were 
needed.

Q: So 
Vera Weitzman
, she didn™t teach any classes, 
she was just there for suppor -- 
ma -- emotional support? 
A: I don™t believe that she taught, no, but
 she was always there. And she was very, 
very -- very enthusiastic about it,
 and very, very involved with it. 
Q: And did the children get report cards?  
A: I don™t know, I -- because it was a school, 
I™m pretty sure that they did, but I 
don™t know. I really don™t know. 
Q: And the food came from 
the -- the farm land that 
-- the surrounding farmland 
that it was a part of? 
A: I don™t know where the food came fro
m, I know that -- that it was strictly 
rationed. I know that all 
of the -- all of the people 
[indecipherable]
 it was strictly 
kosher and therefore had to come from 
Edinburg h
 from the -- fro m the Jewish 
butchers. I™m sure that -- th
at the dairy stuff came from 
the surrounding farms, but 
there again, it was rationed, everything was rationed. And I -- I know that my  
father, as I said before, was -- was himself 
[indecipherable]
 trying to find ex tra 
food for them. I mean
, h-he was always going out. He wa -- because of the person 
he was, he knew people and -- and he wo
uld go out and say lo
ok, there™s a school 
here, you know, so can™t you help? And th
ey would respond to it because they knew 
what kind of a person he was. In fact, I te
ll -- in fact I tell a story which is co -- 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

56
completely different to 
this. When we lived in 
Walkerburn
 during these two years 
i-in our country house, it was a little ti
ny village, and -- and there was -- and there 
was a convent there, and we 
used to go visit the nuns, a
nd -- and they were sewing -
- bless you -- robes for the -- for the 
Edinburg h
 bishops. Anyway, 
it was terribly 
cold, it was pitifully cold. I 
mean, and -- and we had no 
heating at all. And they 
would sit and sew th ese beautiful, beautif
ul embroidered gowns and the -- and th-
their fingers would be blue. And they told  us
 that they were -- th
ey were praying for 
a miracle to  get coal. Coal was also ratione
d. So we told my fa
ther and my father 
went around, around, and he had two tons of
 coal delivered to 
them. And they said, 
you see? We asked for a miracle. That was my father.  
Q: How did he get all the, as you sa
y, petrol to keep  driving out to 
Whittingehame
? 
It took a lot of gasoline.  
A: I don™t know how he got it. I know that 
-- that he had to be very  careful because 
they would -- they wo uld put 
dye in the petrol so that you know if -- if you -- you 
had a certain ration, and afterwards if you got
 black market petrol, it is -- very often 
it -- it had dye in it so they could tell if
 it was non-kosher. And -- and I™m not sure 
how he did it, but -- but he -- I me an, he 
had ways of doing it. 
And he™d ask people. 
He™d just go and say, look
, you know, we need this. 
Q: What did the children call him? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
57
A: Do you know, I do
n™t know? Possibly Mr. 
Cohen
, yeah. Called my mother Mrs. 
Cohen
. 
Q: So now the war is winding down and it 
sounds to me the -- th
e negative part was 
when  the young -- young men ha
d to leave to go to the in
tern men t ca mp s. Bu t wh en  
that happened, did the atmosphere change
 at the school? I mean, the -- all these 
children were enemy aliens. 
A: Yes, they were. 
Q: Were there -- was there any restricti
ons on the children who remained at the 
school a -- from that point on, when the ol
der children had to leave -- the older boys 
had to leave, were there any restrictions
 or did life go on the same once the boys 
left? 

A: Well, I think that when they were declared enemy aliens, they were -- they were 

under much stricter -- they were under a 
much stricter ru le. 
I mean, they couldn™t 
move around th e country, they couldn™t leav e, they had to say where they were this 
time, but of course, for these children they
 were -- they were in the school, there 
was nowhere for them to go to
, but I think that had they  
wanted to , that they would 
have had to sign papers or th
is sort of thing that, you kn
ow, they were enemy aliens, 
and -- and -- and it -- it -- th-t
hey would have to report if
 they went anywhere. But 
apart from that I think that Œ 
that -- you know, that was it. 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
58
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And did 
we talk about the children 
who were in the city who 
were in the different houses coming out 
to the 30 -- the 35 children coming out to  
Whittingehame
? Did they ever do that? 
A: I don™t believe they ever did. I don™t be
lieve they ever did. I don™t believe that -- 
I can™t remember any of the 
Jewish community really going
 out of their way to go 
out there. I think that they -- I think that
 they -- that they 
-- that the board, the 
governors of the school used to go out an
d take their families, but I don™t remember 
any of the other ones going out.  
Q: Mm-hm. So it was just the staff and th
e governors and people like that, who had 
a direct interest going out, but otherwise,
 the regular Jewish residents did not go. 
A: No, as far as I know they didn™t and as 
far as I can remember, I don™t believe that 
the -- the 33 childr -- or 35
 children went out either. 
It may -- it may have been  
because of an petrol restriction, I don™
t know, but as far -- I don™t remember th ere 
ever being any sort of get togeth er with them. 
Q: So now the war is ending, a
nd then wh at -- what happened? 
A: Well, the children all went their certain
 ways, as of say -- the children who found 
out, sadly, that their families were no more
. Other went to othe
r people, o-others 
went to 
Palestine
. Most of them sa -- went to 
Palestine. 
Some di-did find family, 
went to join them, a-and --

Q: Were -- were you out there when the children actually heard that the war was 
over? 

A: No, I wasn™t. 
Q: Do you know if there wa
s any kind of celebration? 
A: Oh, I think there had to be. I mean, I 
remember what it was like for us on -- on 
V-E 
Day, and 
V-J
 Day and I mean, it was sheer jubila
tion, and I think -- I think that 
-- my  own feeling was that, well of course
 there was -- th ere was rejoicing, there 

was also a lot of fear and 
uncertainty what will -- what™s
 going to  happen to us now. 
I mean -- I mean, there had to
 have been. I mean
 they had -- they™d
 been there for 
what, five or six years. They  had some kind 
of -- the security feeling that here were 
their ties, here was a basis. All of a sudde
n they were going to  go out on their own 
again. 
Q: And the youngest were
 14 when they entered -- 

A: Right, right. 
Q: --- wasn™t that -- so th
ey™re now 20 years old. 
A: That™s right. Yes, yes, absolutely. I me
an, it was six years fo
r us, I mean, the war 
was six years and of course the -- they 
were young adults by the time they left. 
Which was -- I mean, which wa
s good, I me an, it had had th
is time to -- to grow up 
in a community that was very, very safe a
nd solid and wherever 
they went to, they

had a good back -- had had a good backgrou
nd, you know, and -- and I™m quite sure 
that the people that taught them were very
, very -- very, very careful to make sure 
that they had somethin
g to fall back on.  
Q: Were you there when any representatives from
 Palestine
 came over to try to 
encourage these young 
people to move to 
Palestine
? 
A: No, I wasn™t. I think thou
gh that -- I don™t think they
 had to enco urage them, I 
think that the children that 
found out that their families 
were no longer alive, didn™t 
have mu ch  -- or, I mean, i-it sounds bad to  say, didn™t have any alternative, but th-
they were lost, I mean, and they though
t that th-there was a home for them in 

Palestine
. It was obviously the best thing fo r them.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Hilda Seftor
. This is tape two, side 
B. 
And we had started talking 
about what happened
 when the war was over, and you
 said some of the children 
went to 
Palestine
. How did they hear -- do you kn
ow how they heard about what 
happened to their fa
milies? Did representatives come
 to the school? Do you have 
any info rmation about that? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
61
A: No, I don™t. I think that 
some of them had written to
 their homes 
and hoped and 
hoped and waited and waited and I think -- I 
believe I remember th at some of them 
got the en velopes back saying that -- that
 their parents were no more. But I don™t 
know -- you know, this is the only thi-thing that I do know. It -- it was a very, very 
hard time for them. 

Q: And how involved w-were
 your parents when the wa
r was over? How in volved 
were your parents at 
Whittingehame 
when the war was over? 
A: I don™t remember h o -how it wound down, 
actually. I really don™t. I mean, I have 
-- I have no 
-- 
so maybe you told us what
 happened when it closed. 
Q: Whe-Wh en did it close, do you rememb er? 
A: No, I don™t. I think -- I think that it must
 have been -- I don™t know if it -- if it 
remained after war finished in 1945, if it we
nt on or not. This is something that I™ve 
been trying to find out, but I have no memo
ry of it. I think that it just wound down 
that the children one by one 
went to the various places, and I think th at they just 
quietly closed.  

Q: What happened to  
Agon
 and 
Max
? 
A: 
Agon
 and 
Ma x
 fo und out -- my parents found out 
that they had distant relatives 
in 
London
, so they -- by that time they were 
-- they were young adults, and they 
went down to live with
 them. I believe that
 Agon
 went into the construction 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

62
busin ess, and I believe that 
Max
 went to work with a fu
rrier. That™s much as I 
know, they both a -- they b
ecame very involved in th
e Jewish community where 
they lived, and they bo
th married girls from 
London. 
And my  father was no longer 
alive at that time, but my 
mother and I, I remember sa 
-- that we caught the train 
twice, to go down to  their weddings. Andt
hey were very, very happy that we did so. 
Unfo rtunately, when  I came to this count
ry  I lost comp lete touch with them. 
Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm. And what ab
out any of the children from
 Whittingehame
? 
A: I have no idea wh ere any of th em went
, I -- I™ve been sendi
ng out inquiries just 
now, trying to find out and ho
pefully that I might find wh
ere some -- some of them 
are. This lady in 
New Jersey
 wh o I talked to has given me the names of some. 
Some of are in 
Pales
 -- some are in 
Israel
 now, and so me 
[indecipherable]
 in 
England 
so  I™m -- I™m trying to find out if I ca
n get in touch with them. And it will 
be great.  
Q: Did you ever go back to 
Whittingehame
 once the children left? 
A: No, I didn™t. I™ve looked it up on the in
ternet and I see the house is still there, 
and I believe it became a correctional li -- sc
h ool for boys afterwards. And I™m not 
sure what it is now. Accordi
ng to what I read on the in
ternet, it has been divided 
into private apartments, but
 it is still owned by the 
Balfour
 family. It is still a 
beautiful, beautiful area, a 
beautiful, beautiful home.

Q: Let™s now talk about what happened 
to you after the wa
r, summa r izing on how 
you got to th is country and so fo rth. So  
the war is over in ™45, and what happened 
with you? 
A: Well, the war finished in
 1945, and unfortunately my  
father died very suddenly 
on th e 19
th
 of June in 1945, just before 
V-E 
Day. He was only 59 years old, it was a 
great, great shock to  us. My mo ther was very
 sick at the time and we went through a 
very, very sad time at that time. A fter th
e war I became engaged to  a man -- to a 
young man from 
Edinburg h, 
one who -- because we knew
 all of the families in 
Edinburgh
, I had grown up with, I had seen him 
at the Jewish holidays and at the 
synagogue and I had been very friendly w
ith -- with his sister, who went to the 
same school I did, and he we
nt he joined the -- the Britis
h army during the war, he 
was a captain in the Royal Engineers and was stationed out in 
India
. And he came 
back after the war and I met him at a -- at
 a Jewish charity dance, and we became 
engaged and married. And he was work ing 
for his mother, who was a furrier. Didn™t 
work out so we decided to emigrate. And 
we ha -- by that time we had one little boy 
who was two years old, 
Lawrence
, and my mother was desperately upset when we 
said we were going. She loved her first 
grandson. And I reme mb er saying to her, 
don™t wo rry, we™ll come back and see you 
in two year™s time. We got to -- well, 
that™s another -- we -- we sailed on the -- on the first 
Queen Elizabeth
. We sailed in 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
64
February, and these ships really rolled. It 
was a very, very  stormy  crossing and mo st 
of the passengers spent all of their time in
 their cabins. We -- she eith er lost or 
gained an hour each day, so we were fi
ve hours -- I™m not sure if it™s ahead or 
behind when  we got to 
New York
. We got to 
New York
 and I remember sailin g up 
the 
Hudson
 and seeing the Statue of Liberty. 
We stayed there overnight and -- and 
a Jewish friend of ours who we befriended wh en-- he was in the American army, 
met us at the boat to go to our hotel, a
nd then to ok us to his home for our first 
American meal. And his -- his wife was a da
ughter of a Jewish butcher, and she had 
prepared huge steaks for us, and we couldn
't  eat them. And she 
was very upset with 
us until we sort of explained we can™t do
 this, you know? Anyw
ay, the very next 
mo rning we got a taxi to 
LaGuardia
 airport and it was bitterly cold, that was -- the 
28
th
 of February I thin k it was,
 bitterly cold and as we 
got on the -- on the plan e it -- 
they were -- they were brus
hing the snow off the wings. And I was terrified. We had 
a two year old child, we were going to 
California
 and I was absolutely terrified. 
My husband was promised a job as a furrier
 there, so we had to get there right 
away. We got on board plane an d my  son
 Lawrence
 started screaming and he 
screamed all the way to 
Chicag o
. In
 Chicago
, all of the pay -- all of the passengers 
were told to get off to get boxed lunches, but by that time 
Lawrence
 had stopped 

screaming, he™d fallen asleep, so we stayed
 onboard. And five hours later we got to

65
Los Angeles. 
When we got to 
Los Ang eles
 it was 90 degrees and I almo st died. I 
honestly almo st died, I had never known 
such heat in my life. We had bought 
clothes in 
Edinburgh
 that was not suitable and we 
-- and we™re met by this friend 
of ours and he took
 us to a motel in 
Studio City
 in the 
San Fernando
 
Valley
 and 
left us there and the very next day so 
Jerry 
found out -- 
Jerry, 
my  husband fo und 
out that the job that we™d come for was 
no longer there. So he started looking 
around and he ended up by wo rking 
in the film labs
. He worked for 
Metro-
Goldwy n-Mayer
, h e  w o rk ed  fo r 
Univ ersal
, this sort of thing. And we lived there 
for three and a half years and in these th
ree and a half years I had two mo re sons. 
One was born - on Ju ly 13
th
 in one year, one was born Au gust 13
th
 of the next year, 
they were 13 months apart.
 Well we didn™t stay in 
Lo s Ang eles
 because 
Jerry
 had 
very, very  bad sinus trouble, so
 we packed up and drove to 
Denver
, 
Denver, 
Colo rado
 and we lived in 
Denver
 for 15 years. Worked out
 very well, our fourth 
son was born there and I love 
Denver
, had a wonderful time there. And -- 
Q: Wha-What year did you come to the 
United States
? 
A: Came to the 
United States
 in 1951. And been here for over 50 years now. And -
- and 
Jerry 
and I became citizens as soon as we c
ould, it was five years after we got 
here, in 1955 -- I think it was in 1955, and our son
 Lawrence
 became a citizen also. 
The other ch ildren, of cour
se, we born over here.  

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

66
Q: What did it mean to you to
 become an American citizen? 
A: Meant an awful lot. I™d always, al
ways loved everything I™d read about 
United 
States
, it was always like a fairy land to me, 
like another country, and of course the 
films, the movies that we saw were, you know, were like the 
Andy Hardy 
mov i es 
and things all looked as if things were so
 wonderful here, and I™d always wanted to 
come here. I had been  engaged to  an Amer
ican during the war, a wonderful fellow 
who lived -- who actually lived in 
Denver, Colora do
. He was in the -- he was a 
navigator of a Flying Fortress.
 And he was my best friend until he died. I mean, he 
was a wonderful fellow. And 
it didn™t work out, so 
Jerry
 and I got married and -- 
and we came over here and -- and 
Bo b 
continued to be a very good friend and when  
we found out that we had to leave 
California
, we decided to go to 
Denver, 
Colo rado
 and he and his -- he and his wife we
re our very good friends here. And -- 
and we stayed there for 
15 years. Then after 15 years we went back  to 
California
 
again. So.  
Q: And then  you st
ayed how long in 
California
? 
A: Then we stayed -- then
 we stayed 15 years in 
California
. 
Jerry
 had had 
whatever was bothering his sinuses had taken care of and 
California
 was all rig h t, 
but I never really wanted it to be my  home,
 I was deathly scared of earthquakes, and 
we™d been  in two of them
. We™d been in the -- the 
Tehach api 
earthquake, I think, 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
67
in 1952 and then in the 
San Fernando 
earthquake. And they™re very, very -- they™re 
very, very  frightening, not 
only the earthquakes but the af
tershocks afterwards. And 
-- and my family used to go to bed early and I™d be sitting in ou
r living room. All of 
a sudden the whole place would heave, just 
silently heave. And after -- after my 
youngest son
 Colin
 was 10 years old, I went to wo rk, and -- 
Q: We-Were the earthquakes mo re frightening than the bombing raids in 
Scotland
? 
A: Yes. I think so. Partly because I-I was 
so young then and it was kind of exciting, 
you know, you hear the sirens
 and I think we were too yo
ung to realize what really 
cou-could happen. An-And -- and -- and my
 parents mu st have agonized. Bu t the 
earthquake, I mean, with the -- with the bo
mbings, you heard the sirens. You knew 
that something was going to  happen and te
rrible things did happen, but with an 
earthquake, all of a sudden, yo
ur whole wo rld is turned 
-- turned upside down. On 
one of them my  husband was sitting at 
the dining room table very early one 
morning and the -- and the -- th e chandelier light above his head -- he was sitting at 
the dining room table, just -- just shattered. And all of the doors in our apartment 
flew open, and -- and it went on from there, and it was the uncertainty, I mean and 

when -- when we lived there all th ese years,
 I had four boys and 
the last earthquake, 
the 
San Fernando
 one, I had two boys at college, at 
UCLA Northridge
. I was 
working in downtown 
L.A.
 and 
Jerry
 was in the 
San Fernando Valley
 and it -- it

kept on going th rough my  mind, if it™
s a bad earthquake and the freeways are 
buckled, we™re all in different parts of -- 
how we going to get together? The place I 
worked with at that 
time was a department store and -- 
and they  had an elevator for 
the employees, and the walls of the elevat
or were so buckled that the elevator 
couldn™t work. It was a very, very fr -- it™s v ery frightening. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I think it™s not knowing that -- that th
e ground under you is -- is going to  move. 
Q: When  did you come to 
Washington
? 
A: Came here in December 1954 -- I™m sorry
, came here i-in -- in December 1994. 
Q: And I™d like to now talk
 to you about your work
 at the museum, why you 
decided, or when  did you decide to
 start volunteering at the mu seum? 
A: Well, I™m the perennial volunteer. I™ve 
-- ever since World War II, I volunteered 
in some way or another all my  life. 
I -- I volunteered for the Red Cross in 
Denver
 
for about 15 years. I have 
thousands of hours there. I 
was head of Red Cross mo tor 
service. That™s another story, but -- 
but I volunteered when we went to 
Tucson, 
Arizona, 
I volunteered in 
Saint Mary™s 
Hospital
 
for nine years. So I™ve always 
volunteered, but when we came t -- when 
we came here, I thought, my goodness, 
the 
United States
 Memorial -- H o locaust Memorial Museum is here, could I 
possibly? And I thought I couldn™t, becaus
e there was the transportation. And we 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006

went down, we saw the museum, we were
 totally overwhelmed, my  husband and 
my  son and I. And I called them and said
, is there any way I could come? And I 
talked to 
Gen ya  Ma rken
. And she said well, we have a training class in October 
but, she said, if you want to come now, I™m 
in the photo archives. So I went into -- I 
went in -- had an interview with her and she said -- she knew that I wasn™t a 
survivor, she knew th at I hadn™t had anything 
drastic happen to me
 during the -- the 
war, yet she said, why do you want to do th
is? And I said, because my  parents were 
so involved and through them I was -- I 
became involved and I said, I™d love to 
think that I™m continuing to  do wh at my  pa
rents were doing. And she said, well you 
know, you can™t just come fo r a couple of hours. Evid en
tly she had some volunteers 
that came in once a week for a couple of ho
urs. She said, you™d have to come and 
make a real investment in this. And I said, 
sure I will. And so I started, and because 
my  husband volunteered at a school and need
ed to be there by eight, he would drive 

me to the 
Metro
 station and I would get to the 
mu seum at seven o™clock in  the 
mo rning. And I had -- I had a special permis
sion from the guards to go in there, and 

it was completely deserted, apart from th
e guards. And I woul
d go up to  the fifth 
floor, everything was quiet and everything 
was partly dark and 
I™d walk across the 
glass bridge and go into the photo arch
ives, and th e first thing I do is put on 
everybody™s computers. I knew all of
 their passwords so that they 
[indeciphera ble]

them. And then I would -- I worked to 
Sh aron Muller
 and -- and -- and 
Teresa 
Pollik -- 
but at that -- 
Pollin, 
but that time w as mainly 
Sharon Muller
, and she was 
-- she was good to work w
ith because she was very, very precise. Extremely 
precise, I mean, and -- and she was never t
oo busy to answ er my  questions. I me an, 
there were always people coming through 
at photo arch ives, asking for things, all 
the 
[indecipherable]
 come in, and I could go over and say, 
Sharon,
 could I 
possibly ask you this and sh e would stop ev
erything and tell me what to do. I mean, 
I™m -- I felt that -- how I say, that I knew 
-- that I felt very confident what I did 
because she taught me how to do it. And I 
-- I worked  there for six years. They 

called me their unpaid staff. 
I would go as -- I worked th
ere four days a week, six 
hours a day. I™d leave there at one o™clock an d 
Jerry
 wo uld meet me. And I did so  
much. I think one of the thin
gs that I™m very, very proud of is that I did -- I 
processed the 
Auschwitz
 collection. That™s a collecti
on of 2400 photographs that 
were found in a suitcase, and this lady 
-- I can™t rememb er her -- her second name, 
but she fo und th em. Anyway, th ey had it in -- in 
Israel
 and we asked them if we 
could have this collection and th ere wa
s a lot of negotiating going on with 
Sharon 
Muller
 and 
Teresa Pollin
 and th-this lady
 Ann
, I can™t rememb er her second name. 
Anyway, she came and she said that if we 
made copies for her that we -- that we 
could have -- we could make copies for our
selves also. So we got the negatives and

71
I remember 
Sharon
 and 
Teresa
 talking themselves one
 day and saying, do you 
think
 Hilda
 would like to do it? So  they asked me
 and I said yeah. I ha -- I think so. 
So I did this whole thing. I had the contac
t prints, I had negatives, I did -- put this 
whole thing together. There were 2400 phot
ographs, I put them by category, by th is, 
and ev erything else. And I got so involved
 with it. They were
 ma -- they were 
mainly from people who had lived  in a place called 
Bedzin
 in 
Poland
 and it was 
near the -- near a mountain 
resort. And it was the saddest thing because here were 
these pictures of these -- these photogra
phs and there are people wh o -- who are 
leading happy lives befo re the Ho locaust.
 There were pe -- there were weddings, 
there were -- there were picnics, there were
 family outings and there were a lot of -- 
lot of photographs of school -- school gr
oups, a-and they  were -- they were the 
Jewish -- what do they 
call them? Gymnasiums? 
Q: Gymn asium. 

A: Gymn asiums, and -- and -- I got to the poi
nt that I would -- I would be ab le to 
pick out the people from the various fam
ilies and -- and be able to put names to 
them and -- and put them on the computer. 
And we got this whole thing togeth er 
and we had them blown up and they™re now 
-- and they™re now in this album that I 
have here, and this -- a -- 
it™s a w o nderful album. But 
Auschwitz
, the collection, is 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
72
really, really very special to me
. And I also did -- I processed the 
Anne Frank 
thing 
there. I did the 
Hannah Szenes. 
I did -- 
Q: Wh-W hat exactly did you do?  
A: I got the photographs togeth er, I put
 captions on th em, I put them on the 
computer, I wrote things about them, and can™t rememb er this other man, this 
wonderful man who led the children out and 
was -- and was killed. I mean, th-there 
was so many things that I did -- 
Q: 
Janusz Korczak
? 
A: Yes, exactly, thank you. And that r
eally touched my  heart, you know? And -- 
and I did the 
Einsatzg ruppen
. I did the concentration camps. But with all of the 
things that 
[indecipherable]
 the concen tration camp s and seeing the stacks of 
bodies, they didn™t affect me as much as 
working with the pict
ures, the photographs 
of people that were happy before the Holo ca
ust, thinking they don™t know what™s -- 
what™s ahead of them. They™re -- there are 
nursery groups with children, in their 
nurse -- I mean, not knowing what™s ahead of 
them. That just br -- i-it really broke 
my heart. And -- and can™t thi -- I mean, I --
 I have a whole collection of wh at I did 
there. And I did important -- important 
Jewish people throughout the world and -- 

and -- and important non-Jewish people thro
ughout the world and 
I used to go into 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
73
the library and spend hours reading up biogr
aphies and things of these people. So I 
mean, I did a lot of -- a lot of work there. 
Q: So you were the one to catalog it, 
to label it, to put them in groups? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 yes, yes.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: I mean -- 

Q: And put it -- put the information on the computer. 
A: Right, right, yeah. And then, after six y
ears, and my  husband died very su ddenly  
and I had surgery and I left and 
then after that, I talked to 
Teresa Pollin
 and she 
said, would you like to work
 with me? And I said, yes 
I™d love to. And -- so I 
started working at home and that™s when I 
started doing -- I did th
is history of this 
little girl w ho came on the t -- on the -- on the 
Kindertransport
 and who was 
heartbroken at leaving her parents. And th
en I -- I recently fi
nished recording th e 
names of 14 and a half thousand 
Polish children that were in the 
Lódz
 ghetto for an 
exhibit that is going to 
be opened  th-this coming fall, I understand, ab out the 
Lódz 
ghetto. 
Teresa Pollin™s 
working on it and she asked me 
to do these in a hurry, and I 
did and what she did -- well, what
 she does is when she goes to 
Israel
, she tries to 
get hold of anybody that might have an
y connection with these people and by 
having th e names with her then she can do it. 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
74
Q: So you entered a
ll these 14,000 names -- 
A: 14 and a half thousand names. 
Q: -- on -- o-on the computer? 
A: I™ll show you. Ye-Yes, I -- I entered 14
 and a half thousand 
names, they were 
Polish names. And they  in 
themselves were heartbreak
ing because some of them 
had the ages on them and so me of themwere little children. Now I™m transcribing 
survivor™s histories and each on e of them is different and 
each one of them is a story 
in itself. 

Q: You™re transcribing from interviews? 

A: Transcribing from -- from 
the material that the muse
um sends me. They send me 
rough drafts, and I transcribe them onto 
the computer and then
 -- and then email 
them back to the muse
um. I think I™m on my  40
th
 just now. 
Q: And what is your feeling wh en  you
 walk into the museum building? 
A: I love being there. It is -- it is the ha
rdest thing for me and th
e saddest thing that I 
can™t go down as often as I used to. I get th
is feeling of awe going in there. I  never 
go in there without this feeli
ng of just absolute awe that 
this -- this building is there 
and that is -- and there™s so much that is going on there, and there™s so much that -- 
that is recorded there. I 
mean, I if I could, I would 
be down th ere every day. 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
75
Q: Is there a particular part of the muse
um, a particular exhibit that you -- that 
affects you the mo st deeply? 
A: I don™t think so. I think I™ve only be
en through the -- the 
permanent exhibition 
perhaps about three times. I can™t do it more
 than that, but there -- the exhi -- the 
exhibits that always hurt me the most, 
really get to my heart, are the ones of 
families -- families loadin
g the transports, families be
ing taken off to the camps. 
These wo nderful people who are sometimes 
beautifully dressed, sometimes not, but 
they™ve got no idea of what™s 
in front of them. This -- 
this is so hard for me. 
Q: Does it bring back  memo ries of 
the children that you met in -- at 
Whittingehame
 and the other boys, the -- 
Agon 
and 
Ma x
? I mean, does it stimulate 
your memories when you go there? 

A: Oh yes, of course it does. I me an, I 
see children in these photographs, they  look 
so much like the child
ren that were at 
Whittingehame
, so -- so much like 
Max 
and
 
Agon
.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. Do you have a lot of 
contact with the other volunteers at the 
mu seu m? 

A: No, I think that what I 
-- the work that I™v
e been doing has always been kind of 
something that I™ve done by myself and I 
really have no contact with the other 
volunteers at all. In fact, I don™t think I d
on™t think I know any of them. I have -- I 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
76
have gone to the appreciation nights in th
e past, but I don™t go any mo re and I don™t 
go to  the dinners, and I™m perfectly happy not
 to. I think I™m just
 happy to do what 
I™ve done, you know, and I know the ot
her volunteers are a commu nity in 
themselves and they know each
 other and that™s fine. One of the things I do, and I 
try to do every year, is 
I go down on Holo caust Reme mb
rance dray -- day, and I 
read names. And I™ve done this every year. 
Q: Mm-hm. N-Names of the victims? 
A: Yeah. Yeah, the names of the victims a
nd sometimes they™re ve
ry , v e ry  h a rd  to  
read, they -- you know, Polish or Czechoslo vak.
 
This year I went down and they 
gave me a choice and I chose names that were from
 Norway,
 and they were easier 
to read. But I mean, ea
ch one of them is a heartbreak
, I mean. You -- you read these 
names and you see families, you see whole gr
oups of names and you see ages from 
the grandfather to the little children just mont
hs old, and it has to tear out your heart 
to know that they a
ll -- they all perished. 
Q: Did you ever go back to visit in 
Scotland
? 
A: I™ve been back to 
Sco t la nd
 three, perhaps four times. We wouldn™t leave our 
children when they were grow
ing up. The first time my  husband and I went back to 
visit was in 1973 on our 25
th
 anniversary. And my  husband and I went back, I think 
twice after that. And then I went back ba 
-- by my self about nine years ago to visit 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
77
my  cousin, who has a fa 
-- who had a farm outside 
Edinburg h
. And then the last 
time I went to visit was with my son, tw
o years after that. And I don™t think I™ll go 
back again. 
Q: Do you feel Scottish? 
A: Yes, I do feel Scottish, yes I do. I 
mean, I -- I guess -- when I go over there 
people say that I talk with 
an American accent. Here they
 say I talk with a Scottish 
accent. But there™s something 
very, very Scottish about me
, and I love to hear the 
bagpipes. I get so homesick. And a -- a f
unny story that I will tell you is that a 
friend of mine told me that she had a fri
end who play s the bagpipes in the American 

Air Force Bagpipe Band, of all things. And 
sh e said, he would like to meet you. So 
she brought him here one evening, with hi s bagpipes. Now this 
is a -- this is a 
town house association and -- and -- and ther
e are neighbors on the side. He brought 
out his bagpipes and started to play. No
w, you know how loud they are. My -- my 
son at the time was the president of the 
homeown er™s association. I could see him 
literally getting paler by the minute. But 
it was great. I mean, I mean I can have 
tears in my eyes when I h
ear the bagpipes. It brings back so much to me. I 
absolutely love it. 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

Q: Is there anything else you™d want to ad
d before we end? Any th oughts that you 
have, wh ether the wo rld has learned from th
e Holo caust or anything that you care to 
add? 
A: I don™t know. I honestly don™t know. I wa
s left with a feeling of antagonism bu -
- towards anything German. I didn™t want to
 know German people or anything like 
this, but in the last few  years I -- I have
 two very good friends who are German. 
One very, very dear friend who is in 
Co burg
, 
Germany
, and I realized that there 
are good people everywhere, and that -- 
and one can™t judge people by th eir 
nationality, by their race or anything else. I m
ean, I feel that -- that what is going on 
now i-in the world is deeply upse
tting. You know, you see anti-Semitism 
everywhere, you see racism ev
erywhere, and I don™t think that -- I don™t think it will 
ever be any -- any better, and that™s what really bothers me. 
Q: Well, it™s wonderful that you continued 
to work  and to document these people™s 
history. That™s wonder -- 
wonderful that you do th at. 
A: Well, you know, we™re all getting so  mu
ch older, the survivors and myself, we™re 
getting very mu ch older and it™s so good to  
know that anything th at we can say now 
might live on and th at people can perhap
s listen to it and hear what it was like 
during th ese year, and -- and fo
r me myself, my -- my prim
e reason for doing this is 
so that people would get to know what my
 parents did, how mu ch  they cared, how

79
much they agoni
zed over what was happening in  
Europe
 and how mu ch they 
wanted to  help and how mu ch they  did help
 in a very, very qu
iet way, but they -- 
they gave ev erything that they could and 
I think that this sh
ould be remembered . 
Q: Yeah.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Hilda Seftor
. This is tape number three, side
 A. 
You had mentioned something previously about a 
menorah
. Can you tell me about 
that? 
A: Yes, at 
Whittingehame
, my  parents loved being there and they  were very, very 
surprised when they were i
nvited to go out one special 
evening and they -- because 
they didn™t usually get an i
nvitation, we went out and that was fine and th ey -- the 

staff said no 
[indecipherable]
 co me out tonight, could you possibly come, and we 
said okay. So we came out and -- and -- and 
I™m not sure how many of this -- of the 
children were there, if they 
were all there or not, I don™t rememb er that, but one of 
them got up and made a speech and said th
at they had worked 
on something very 
special as a gift for my parents and they
 were going to  present it to them. And the 
brought out this absolutely beautiful
 menorah 
that they had carved by th emselves 
and written in Hebrew on it. It was about 
three foot across, and -- and made of 
beautiful wood, and they said that th ey would like us to have it and -- in 

appreciation for all that we had done for th
em. Well, we took -- my par -- my father 
was a very quiet man who wa -- had a very
 soft heart and when
 he™s touched and 
the tears came to his eyes, and he said so
mething appropriate, I™m not sure what he 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
81
said. But we took it home and we used it every year and it was on our -- on our 
sideboard at home every year that I remembe
r. Then I was the first o f the family  to 

leave the country and when 
I left my mother was still 
alive, and there was the 
menorah
. And then after that my sister left
 and th e last person to  leave was my  
brother. And we didn™t know, ev idently he 
brought everything he could. And he is 
no lo nger alive, but his wife lives in 
Sa n F rancisco
 -- very, very fond of her. And 
about three months ago she called me and 
sai d  she was cleani
ng up her garage and 
she said that she found this
 wooden thing in th e corne
r, would I know what it was 
and would I be interested in
 it? And she expl -- she described it and I said, oh my  
God, 
Pat,
 I said that™s the 
menora h
. And I said, don™t -- don™t get rid of it. I said, 
would you consider giving 
it to the mu seum? And she said, well, she said, I  don™t 
see why not. She says, I™ll ask my  
two children. One of them is in 
Edinburgh
 just 
now, one of them was with her. 
So  she asked her two children, 
Mandy 
and 
David
 
and they  said -- they didn™t know mu ch ab
out the mu seum, but they s -- and I said, 
you know what, I™m going to 
send you some information.
 So I sent them all th e 
pamphlets, all the documents I had. And she 
said, yes, of course we™ll give it to the 
museum. And sh e said, if it™s all ri
ght with you, I™ll donate it with 
David
 and 
Mandy™s
 names. So the 
U.S.
 -- the museum™s -- a conser
vatory group came out to 
her very early one morning, 
they packed it up, 
they brought it back here and it is 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

82
now in th e mu seum. And -- and it really doe
s my heart good to know that it™s there 
and that something that was given to my
 parents will always be there for them. 
Q: That™s wonderful. W-When
 did your mother pass away? 
A: My mother passed away in
 April sum -- 1 9 51, six week
s after I arrived in this 
country. She had a stroke and died the same
 day. And I -- broke my  heart and -- and 
-- and we had just come over here and I was arranging to take my  son
, Lawrence
, 
who was two years old back  there. And -- a
nd th en -- and we went through all of the 
things about getting permits and things and 
then I suddenly realized, they can™t hold 
a funeral, she™s already gone, what™s the poi
nt of going back? So  I didn™t go back 
for over 20 years. But she was a lovely pers
on, and as I sa y, she -- she was so upset 
when we left, and you know, perhaps it wa
s best that it happened that way because 
had she lived she would 
have been  -- you know. 
Q: You had mentioned a little bit be
fore about your feelings about 
Germa ny
. I w-
wanted to  know wh at your feelings about
 being Jewish were. 
I mean, here you all 
helped to take care of these children. Do
 you think -- during th
e war years -- do you 
think that m-made an impression on your 
Jewishness? Did it make you feel more 
Jewish or did it not have any effe
ct on that aspect of your life? 
A: Oh, I think it definitely made me more
 aware of who I was an-and -- and -- and 
of being Jewish. We ourselves didn™t en
counter any -- any an imosity or any anti-

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
83
Semitism, but coming over here I realized 
that there were -- that there was more 
anti-Semitism over in 
Great Britain
 than I™d realized, and th
at people were not so -
- so willing to wear a 
Mogen David
, or wear some -- someth
ing to show that they 
were Jewish. And I found it -- it™s a muchmore open society here when I came over 

here. So while we had -- we had absolutely
 no -- no so rt of contact with anything 
that made us feel that w-we were unwelcom
e or anything, I know that there was that 
there. And we were very, very -- I mean, we
 were very, very pr
oud of being Jewish, 
and as I say, we were the only Jewish ch
ildren, the five of us, in our school, and -- 
and we felt kind of important because of
 it. You know, I mean
, there was -- there 
was no feeling of bias or anyt
hing else. But it did happen.  
Q: What forms did it take? 

A: Oh, I -- I think it -- it was -- it was covert. 
I think that the kind of people that my 
parents were also, I think peop
le would hesitate to -- to 
do anything to them because 
they were such kind people and they were
 always help ing othe
r people. I mean, I 
talk about refugees -- the 
refugees, I talk about the 
Kindertra nspo rt
, I talk about 
Whittingehame
, but there were so many other peopl
e that they helped in every way 

they could, I mean, they were
 just kind, kind people that 
-- that just were always out 
for other people. And I think th at being a sort
 of a fairly small town, in a way, that 
people were aware of it. 
Edinburg h
 is a much bigger and more of a cosmopolitan

town than it is -- than
 it was when I lived there. There was no trans-
Atlantic
 flights, 
there were no tourists there. It was a very, 
very quiet city. It wa
s all  -- it was al most 
a sleepy city, not like it is now. And - and my
 father knew the mayor, and in fact the 
house that we had, and actually we leased
 it during the war, it was bought after we 
left by the 
[indeciphera ble]
 of 
Edinburg h
. So I mean, he sort of knew people and 
he -- and he felt very comfortable with th
em, and so I don™t -- so if there was any 
anti-Semitism, we didn™t see it. B u t I -- I th
ink sometimes that while it™s not always 
the case, th at it™s the kind 
of person you are also. That
 may be wrong, but -- 
Q: Have you shared this story about wh at
 your parents did during the war, with 
other people? Do you -- does it something 
that comes easily to
 you and that you 
share with a lot of other people? 
A: Yes, I do, particularly now. Particular
ly now as I™m getting older and -- and that 
the surviv ors don™t have that mu ch longer, 
obviously . Bu t I am so, so anxious that 
people do hear about my  parents, do kno
w that they did something good, and -- and 
-- and helped other people that I do go out of
 my  way, I go out of my  way that you -
- in ways that I would not have thought ye
ars ago. I am a memb er of -- of a club on 

the internet, a lovely club, 
I™ve been a memb er now fo r about five, six years, and it 
started off as a book club and I™m the only Je
wish person and I bring out all the time 
about being Jewish, about the Jewish holid ay
s, and in particular about this -- about 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

Whittingehame
, about the 
Kindertransport
. They are now so in
terested in it. And 
they will -- they will tell their 
children and they will tell th
eir friends and this is how 
I feel that p eople get to know. I mean, I -- 
it™s not myself I want to talk about, it™s 
the fact that I had so -- su
ch wonderful -- such a wonde
rful example, you know, and 
-- my own children. It™s funny because my ol
dest son always used to  say to me -- he 
resented the fact that we came over here 
and that he™s got no family over here, 
because he knew that 
my mother was one of eight child
ren, and that we had a very, 
very big family group in 
Edin burgh
. And I said, but this is what happens. And I 
said, after the war, everybody kind of sepa
rated anyway. But he said to me, what 
was it like for you growing up? And I sat 
down and wrote him 10 pages. And he 
said to me, it™s like a fairy tale. A nd I sa
id, this is how it was, it was a different 
world. And I want -- and I wanted to sh 
-- and -- and my -- and I said to him do me 
a favor and copy to send it to your other br
others. I want them to know and I want 
them to tell their children. And ma -- ba
sically  about being Jewish and living in a 
Jewish household, an d -- and -- and being memb ers of an -- of a community, about 
sort of going to the shul, going to
 services every Saturday morning. 
[indecipherable] Shabbat
 afterwards and just -- it™s n o t what they do, but I want 
them to know about it, so -- 

Q: Have you stayed as obser
vant when  you came to the 
United States
 and now? 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
86
A: No, we haven™t. We -- we are now me
mbers of Reform, a-and that™s fine, I 
mean, my  husband 
Jerry
 was never as observant and we 
just sa -- sort of gradually 
sort of grew away from it. And that was 
fine, you know, but it™s there in me, you 
know? I mean, wa -- wonderfu
l memories of the sheer ec -- the excitement about 
changing the dishes at
 -- 
at 
Pesach
, and ho -- and wh at fun it was to eat out of 
different dishes, you know, this sort of 
thing and -- and it™s always -- my mother 
used to buy great big cases of ma tzoh and sh
e used to give a pack
et to each of her 
Christian friends. Sh e always did th
at. And I do it now. I™m a volunteer at
 Inova
 
Fairfax
 Hospital. Made very good friends there and at 
Pesach [indecipherable]
 
several friends, I™ve taken matzoh into th em. You know? And it™s good. I think it™s 
good. I hope it™s good. 
Q: Were you able to get matzoh du
ring the war and did you bring it to 
Whittingehame
?  

A: We obviously  got -- 
[phone ringing] 
-- 
Colin™s
 got a phone down there -- we 
obviously got matzoh during the war, 
and actually yes, we got it in 

Whittingehame. 
In fact, in one of the photographs that I have and the -- and the 
museum have, there is pile -- the -- ther
e™s a whole pile of boxes of matzoh for 
them. So in some way they got it, yeah. 
[phone answering mach ine]
 Sorry, I™m 
sorry.

Q: Have you been  to 
Israel
? 
A: No, no. We had hoped to 
go at one time, but raising 
four young boys, this was 
never possible, so unfortunately no, we didn™t go. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Wh
en events like the 
Eichmann
 trial came, did that stir up 
more memories of th
e war time in -- in 
Scotland
 for you? 
A: Oh yes, i -- obviously it did, I mean, we
 followed very, very closely and couldn™t 
understand how people 
could be so evil. I -- I saw quite recently -- I™m not sure if 
you™ve seen this movie, ﬁ
A Judgment at Nu remberg
ﬂ? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But it was shown again and I™ve -- I put it on tape because just -- I mean, it™s 
fiction, but even -- even  watching this bri
ngs back that whole era so vividly. And -- 
yes. 
Q: And again, your thoughts about 
Germany
 you said have changed over the 
years? 
A: Yes, they have changed and this isa funny thing is that my  husband ha-h ad  
never been  terribly involved  w
ith things that I™ve 
been interested in, as in going to 
the Holocaust Museum. I mean
, he supported me, but this
 was my  thing. But -- and 
his parents did take a refu -- one of the 35 ch
ildren and I hate to say this, but I th -- I 
have a feeling that my mother-in-law trea
ted this little girl more of a domestic. But

anyway, the thing was this, that
 we went to -- we went to 
Europe 
in the 1980™s, and 
we went thro ugh 
France, 
and
 Belgium
 and -- and the 
Netherla nds
 and got to 
Luxembourg, 
and th en  we drove to the German border. And it™s a beautiful area, a-
and we could see -- and we could see a castle in the di
stance, and I said, let™s go 
over. He said, I can™t. And I said, come on 
Jerry,
 it™s just another border, let™s go. 
He said, I™m sorry 
Hilda
, I just can™t. A-And he wouldn™t go. So  I mean, he had 
much deeper feelings than he™d ever, ev
er, you know. But yes, my  feelings about 
sort of, 
Germany
, have changed. I don™t know -- 
I have mixed feelings about it 
because in one of 
Leon Yuris™s 
books, he tries to explain this make-up of a 
German, the physiology and all 
[indecipherable]
 and I believed him -- him 
completely, but as I say, I™v
e been  in contact with couple of people recently, and 
one in particular, and they are lovely 
people. And I feel that you can™t label 
everybody the way I once did. And I have
 a friend whose mo ther was German and 
she™s no longer alive. Every time I saw her, 
she™d be apologizing. And I -- and she I 
think lived in 
somewhere like 
Essen
 or something that was terribly badly bomb ed 
and they  went out sort of looking for pot 
-- sort of scraping for potatoes, they were 
so hungry. She was 
telling me all this 
[indecipherable]
 she says, you know? And I 
say, look, you can™t go back and -- a
nd -- everybody had problems. But I think it 
made me realize that -- I 
mean I-- myself, I could neve
r understand -- I could never 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor  
 
June 12, 2006 
 

 
 
89
understand how the German people could 
not see what was going on. How th ey 
couldn't see that the -- their neighbors we
re all disappearing. I mean, this could 
never be explained to  me. But it™s a new 
generation and I think th at the German 
schools, that they™re bending 
over backwards to teach the 
children. And I -- they say 
at one time the Japanese were taking th is
 whole thing out of their -- out of the 
history books, it just didn™t happen . Bu t th
e Germans are bending over backwards to 
make sure that they understand what -- what
 went on. And of course they still have 
their -- their anti-Semites, and th -- and th
eir -- their Nazis with their -- with their 
armbands on, but listen, we all have them. 
I mean, look what™s 
happening here. So I 
think that hopefully -- hopefully this will 
never happen again and I feel that this 
new German generation is diffe
rent. I can only hope so. 
Q: Do you feel it 
could happen ag ain? 
A: In this country? No I don™t think so . Bu
t as I read the paper 
every mo rning, and I 
got to th e point of saying, I hon -- hones
tly hesitate to read
 the paper in the 
morning. I -- I really despair of what™s goi
ng on th roughout the world. I think th at -- 
that the lesson has not been learned, w
ith the brutality that -- that we see 
everywhere, in 
Darfur, 
the 
Congo, 
everywhere. I mean, it™s ju
st incredible what™s 
happening. So whether it could happen agai
n, not in th is country, but I honestly 
don™t know.

Q: Do you have friends who are survivors? 
A: No, I don™t. No, I don™t. 

Q: Do you -- do you speak to an y of the 
survivors who work  at the mu seum? Have 
you had contact with them? 

A: No. No, I don™t. As I say, I don™t sp
eak to anybody at th
e museum except the 
people that I work with
. I never have done.  
Q: Mm-hm. Did -- do you -- how often did y
ou talk ab out th -- what your parents 
did, how often did you talk ab
out that with your children? 
A: Not very often. I think th
at when you have -- when you 
have girls, girls want to 
know how you™ve -- growing up. So 
girls want to know about your past 
[indecipherable]
 boys don™t. I me  -- I found th
is out, you know, they™re busy doing 
their own thing, everything else. And th
at™s why, wh en my  son asked me, and I 
realized, I sat down and wrote. I™ve written,
 I think, two things for them. One of 
them, what it was like so -- during the wa
r, during the six years for me, and they 
each have it and I™ve -- I have another on
e about sort of growing up, what it was 
like with this bigger -- this 
large family that we had.
 Cause my -- my parents™ 
house, it was always an open house, and 
it -- at the weekends nobody was invited, 
but everybody dropped in. This
 is something I™ve never be
en able to understand in 
this country why friendships are almo st
 nonexistent here whereas, you th ink, oh 

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

well I™ll -- I™ll go visit somebody some even
ing and you™ll -- and 
you™ll drop in, it™ll 
be great, I™ll put the coffeepot on, I™ll put 
out a cup of tea. Yo
u don™t do that here. 
I™ve been in -- in this
 country over 50 years and I™ve ne
ver seen the friendship that I 
see -- that I used to see in 
Scotland
. I went back there about 10 years ago to my  
cousin™s farm, and I could see it there. I coul
d see that it hasn™t changed. Bu t here is 
different. So I mean it -- it™s just different. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. When you were gr
owing up, would you™ve -- you™d de -- 
identif -- would you have identified yourself 
as Scottish or Jewish
 or both, or -- 
A: Definitely both, definite
ly both. I mean, I wouldn™t say I was Jewish first, I 
wouldn™t say I was Scottish first, I say I 
was -- I was a Scottish Jew, definitely. 
Q: Well, is there anything else -- 

A: No, not really. 

Q: -- that we can talk about? 

A: No. 
Q: I™m trying to  think of wh at else that you may -- 
A: I think th at™s -- that™s about it. I th ink -- I think that™s about my  whole life™s 

story.  

 
Interview with Hilda Seftor

Q: Well, it™s important that you got your
 parent™s stories and wh at a wonderful -- 
acts that th ey did during the war. That™s very
 important that that™s now going to be 
in the archives so people will know about them. 
A: I am -- I am so grateful and so thrilled th
at this is going to be, and my one regret 
always has been that they bo
th died so early, they both di
ed when they were 59, and 
I think so  often of wh at else could they ha
ve done, had they lived  to be as old as I 
am. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. Well, you™ve given th
em a great gift by putting th is down  for 
posterity. So  thank you very
 much for doing the interv
iew. This concludes the 
interview of 
Hilda Seftor.
