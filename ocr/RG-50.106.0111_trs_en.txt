Q: And where did you settle when you came to the 
United States? 
A: Well, we settled in 
Washin gton, D.C. 
Q: Before you came to the 
United States, 
what were your expectations of 
America
? 
A: Well, we had a lot of the idea of th
e Œ from the movies, you know, and from the 
news Œ there was a newsreel late in one of 
the movies, so you got the idea of the big 
build ings, and th e Œ and the beau tiful 
New York
 and all of those skies Œ what do 
you call them? Skyscrapers, and you know, like that. 
Q: What surprised you about life in
 America
 when you first arrived? 
A: Well, one of the things that was very 
su-surprising when I started to read, that 
you didn™t judge the people by
 their profession and by wh at they did for humanity, 
but with a price tag. It seemed that at
 Œ the man, 200,000 dollar man. You know, 
that just was very Œ the people who did so
 much for humanity or fo r their country, 
had an  un Œ a name tag. And I see no
w, I would have Œ wh ere I live in the 
retirement home, many men who 
are here and they had bi
g positions, but since that 
price tag is up, they  don™t feel very 
comfortable, you know? They  feel very 
depressed and so  on. So , that Œ that™s 
something fo r your whole life, I think. 

Q: When you came to the 
United States, 
who did you come with? 
A: I came with my husband an
d a two year old little girl. 
Q: How did you support yourse
lves when you first came? 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

A: Well, I really couldn™t support myse
lf because I knew very little English, like 
please and thank you, good mo rn ing and some 
[indecipherable]
. My husband, who 
was a physician and knew 
English and some other la
nguages, got a job in  
Ca sua l ty  
Hosp ital in 
Washin gton, D.C.
 driv ing the ambulan ce, 
and he got 50 dollars a 
month and room an
d board. So with 50 dollars a m
onth my little girl and I stayed an 
apartment house where he paid
 12 dollar a week. So  that™s Œ because we could not Œ 
the only thing we could take
 with us was eight dollars per person. We had 24 
dollars with us. So that th Œ took a long time 
til we were able to Œ 
even to move into 
a room and s Œ and use kitchen facilities. Bu
t you know, we Œ it somehow, with this 
Holocaust survivors, I think 
mo st of us did not expect
 that the government or 
different places will take care of us. So 
it was a very difficult time an d my little girl 
and I went to Americanization school to 
learn English. And we met a lot of other 
refugees and came through 
France 
with some of them. And little by little we got to 
know some of the physicians and we were 
in-invited a lot, and it was very difficult. 
If you don™t Œ if you don™t Œ 
can™t reciprocate, you feel 
rather badly about. And we 
came to visit one of the doctors, and th e doct
or™s wife said, oh, 
go up the steps, on 
the bedroom you put your coat on, and the bath
room is there. So I looked  at myself, 
I said, what™s wrong with me, you know, 
is my petticoat hanging out, how do I 
look? But sh Œ sh Œ I didn't realize that pe
ople want to make you co mfortable, as 
you know where the bathroom 
is, or where you can put yo
ur coat. Th-This is some

of the things which are not done in Œ in 
Vienna
, or Œ or in 
Austria
 in a certain 
class, you know, so Œ so  there were many, ma ny th ings. It took a long time to be 
comfortable, to ask somebody. Now I will as
k, oh, you have a lo
vely bag. If you™re 
finished with it, you don™t it, give it to 
me. O r I go Œ I dr Œ I 
dro Œ drove by, and Œ 
some friend, three in the afternoon and I 
was hungry and I would visit a friend and I 

s Œ and I Œ I said, 
Jean,
 I™m so hungry, wh at do you have
 in your refrigerator? But I 
had a 
Visa
, I could si Œ and I had some dollar 
bills, and I could buy something, but 
it Œ it Œ it was different now, that I could as
k people to do or give me something. 
But when we first came it was very depr
essing to have to ask. We went in 
New 
York
 to try to get sponsor
s for some family in 
France
 and it was in August, in 
September, it was very, very hot. And when
 we walked into so
mebody™s and they 
offered a glass of water, as you did right now,
 we said no thank you. We didn™t even 
want to accept a glass of water, we felt so 
Œ s-so bad ab out ourself that we couldn™t 
[indecipherable]
. So it was very wonderful that
 so many people gave affidavits. 
They  didn't even know the family, or they 
didn™t Œ they  had the s-same name or 
something, you know, and Œ 
and it was really wonderful 
the way, particularly the 
very poor Jews in Œ the poorer class, 
you know. Of course, they had to have a 
certain income, or a t-tax return
 to show th at they would be
 able to Œ to support or Œ 
or help Œ help the people. So 
it was a very di-difficult time.  
Q: Did somebody help you 
and your husband and ch ild 
come to this country? 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

A: Not really, because my husband was regist
ered at the Œ at Œ at the embassy as a 
student to come to the 
United States 
with his professor. So he was on th e Œ well, 
we had, or my  husband ha
d family here in Œ in 
United States. 
But we Œ we had a 
certain pride, you know, and ju st to take or
 ask me for something, it™s very difficult.  
Q: When  you came to this country, did pe
ople ask you about wh at was happening in 
Austria
? 
A: No. The pi Œ the peop Œ some knew 
Vienna
 or 
Austria
 from Œ from visiting 
there or from movies and so  on. People were 
not so Œ so interested
 in Œ in wh at had 
happened, and a Œ it was very little known,
 you know. Even we
 didn™t know too 
much about. We were very fortunate to leave Œ
 Hitler 
marched in on the 13
th
 of 
March, and we were very fortunate to l
eave the beginning of July , you know. So  Œ 
but my  husband had, as a physician, really 
terrible experiences. He could not treat 
Jewish people at all, or Œ or in Œ not Œ 
he couldn™t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but 
Jewish people he could treat. And he woul
d get phone calls from 
the family that the 
husband was taken to concen tration camp, 
Da cha u , Buchenwa ld.
 On Œ on the 
following week she received a Œ at Œ not a 
fa Œ didn™t have faxes that time, a 
telegram that her husband had died on pn
eu monia and they have Œ she would get 
the ashes back. So he knew all these and 
he was very, very depressed, but it was 
very difficult for him to get ready to leav
e, much more somehow than it was for me. 
You know, and I felt for a longest, longest 
time until we had the first interview that 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

you did, I felt very guilty that
 I, my family, we were able to escape and Œ here, and I 
was able, you know, the education that I Œ th
at I have to make a success, and so did 
my  husband here, and here my  family and Œ 
and friends lost their Œ their life, and Œ 
and so I Œ I felt very, very guilty. But now
, since that Œ it has changed my attitude 
since that interview and also I did not r
ealize that I Œ that I am considered a 
Holo caust survivor. I didn™t Œ never, neve
r occurred to me to be in the same 
category. But now I feel that I have 
a voice, I can do something and I™m very 
fortunate that I have that 
Montessori
 education, or early ch
ildhood education that I 
was doing so  mu ch in th e 
United States, 
was very successful. I got the gold medal 
for my work in 
America 
for the Œ in 
Montessori. 
I got 
[indecipherable]
 wh at do 
you call it, gold medal from the Œ from the embas Œ from 
Austria. 
I got my  
citizenship back, and I have a voice. Beingangry, it Œ it does not help. So  I feel now 

that since the Œ all my writing, I have wr
itten about 18 Œ not Œ not high class and not 
people wh o made the best seller list, but 
they helped the peop
le, the poor people 
that I worked in 
Mississippi
 to write and be able to vo Œ to vote.  
Q: I™m going to ask you to 
pause because you™re running a little bit ahead of me. I Œ 

I would like you to tell me how you began 
your professional care
er, and I™d like you 
to explain about your background with 
Montessori. 
I-I would like you to take your 
time and do that very slowly , from the beginning, please.

A: Well, w-w Œ in 
Vienna
, you know, after the first 
World War, we began to  ask 
ourselves, what is wrong with education, 
wh at has to be done? And we were young 
people and so we wanted 
to change the world. So
 Montessori
 was brought, she was 
a physician from 
Italy
 and she brought the 
Montessori
 method to
 Vienna.
 So we 
all ran to these lectures and got a Œ a book 
th at sh Œ the first book she wrote and so 
on. And you had, in 
Vienna
 you had to do first your 
ex am as a kindergarten 
teacher, you know, and then
 you could specialize in 
[in d ecipherable]
 in
 
Montessori. 
So I took the Œ the training, then
 when I got married, I opened up a 
kindergarten , and I Œ cause I had the middle 
or the upper middle class children. I did 
not have the poor Œ the poor on es as I really had here in 
America
. So na Œ when I 
first came, it took a long time til 
I learned enough English to take some of the tests 
that were necessary to establish mysel
f. And at that time was the English word 
against the English 
[indecipherable]
 that™s what the Œ some of Œ of the newcomers 
have to learn, you know, that
 you have to know the langua
ge in order to be political 
active or Œ or Œ or Œ or have a job and 
[indecipherable]
 thing. So first I got 
different jobs in special education, because 
at that time in  the early sh Œ the sp ecial 
education was on the lower bottom of the e
ducation. So Œ so wh en I applied they 
were happy to Œ to get me to take care of
 the special class child
ren. And then  they 
were very surprised the big su
ccess, because I was bootlegging 
Montessori
. I made 
a lot of material, I use that method of 
Montessori
, and so the superv isor, she used 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
10
to bring teachers or students to observe in my
 Œ in my classes and so on, to see what 
I™m doing. 
Q: Can you explain what 
is different about the 
Montessori
 program that you were 
initiating, as opposed to what was going 
on in this country at that time? 
A: For one thing, I did not initiate. 
Montessori 
was here in the early Œ 1913 she wa 
Œ she was here, and there were schools and 
by 1918 wh en the war Œ when  the first 
World War start, these schools were all closed. 
Montessori
 approach  is entirely 
different, it™s very difficult to
 explain on Œ on 
a few minutes. 
Q: If you could just give a little b it of
 an idea for someone who does not know 
about 
Montessori.  
A: Okay . Fo r one thing, it™s a different layout of a classroom. Ch ildren are Œ are not 
expected because they™re six y
ears old that they be reading, or three years old. We 
don™t Œ we Œ in a classroom we have ch
ildren from three to 
six, for instance, 
because a three year old one might be able
 to read, or a four year old one, but 
unable to kick a ball or something th an a si
x year one. So they™re Œ it™s a such Œ like 
in a family. We do a different classroom a
rrangement. So we don™t have this is the 
class two years old, or four year one, we 
have them Œ we have now infants™ classes 
too, you know. So this is one of the things
. And also that th-there are certain rules 
and Œ and regulations in a 
Montessori
 classroom and people in th Œ it has to work  
like a Œ like a society. You can Œ I mean, 
you have to sh ow them, for instance, how 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
11
to open a door and close a door. How to 
lift a chair and put it down. And how Œ and 
if you play with something, that y Œ I cann
ot come and say, this I want to play now 
with it. So, he learns that he has to ask. 
We have little rugs for the children, and they 
put their toys on that rug, and th is is his 
territory. So  they  have
 to learn territorial 
rights. It™s laid out the way, like a library
 with the books and 
stuff. You just can™t 
take out a book and then, oh, I want to read
 the book. We have to
 return it to there, 
and th-th-then next child can. So that the 
Œ he learns in Œ the way a classroom and 
the way th e whole thing is handled, he lear
ns the rules for society. So, th-this is a 
very im Œ important, and th e different exp
ectations for the parents too, to Œ to 
understand that, you know? And th e teac
her is not called a teacher, she is a 
directress, she directs activities. She doesn™t
 sit at her desk and the children come 
in, she has to be like a hostess, stand at
 the door, greet the children. And as she 
greets them, says
 Esther, 
you have a lovely dress and your
 hair is done so nice. Oh, 
and you have such a doll. And 
Esther
 says, oh my  grandma 
came and shebrought 
me that doll. So you know 
from that, that the child will 
want to walk around the 
classroom, show the doll to he
r. Sh e doesn™t want to disturb. And then there comes 
Jim
, and 
Jim
 is so sad. So he said, you know,
 teach Œ some didn™t know, you know, 
very mu ch . He said, you know, the police ca
me and Œ and took my  ha Œ my  father 
to jail. Then you know that 
this child needs help, somebody 
to help him to deal with 
it. And so th at your aid spends a lot 
of time because otherwise he™s gonna run 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
12
around, disturbing and kn
ocking things over 
[indecipherable]
 knocking things 
over. He Œ somehow he has to deal with it,
 but then you assign somebody to help 
him, hold his hand, take him around and so  on. So  that 
Montessori
 said like a 
hostess. If she greets the people at
 the door and says, oh, Mrs. 
Finder,
 you have a 
lovely dress today, and Œ and th en you tell 
[indeciphera ble]
 or your husband to go 
and get yourself a drink. You don™t talk to 
her the rest of your party, but she will 

come home and she says, you know, Mrs.
 Finder 
saw what a beau tiful dress I had, 
you know. So the same way children know 
they Œ they were re
cognized, and that 
you knew dealing with their pr
oblems or Œ and also, this 
teaches sort of manners to 
the children, to greet people
 in the morning. Some peop
le talking Œ were critical 
when I talked at one of th
e university, I had some blackstudents, teachers. And he 
said, oh yes, you come from a country, ki
-k ings and queens 
and you shake hands 
and you do all these nice things
. But it™s a Œ a very important thing to be nice, and 
so on. And so we do a lot 
training and what you call prac
tical life. A nd under that 
comes also the manners and behavior. And wh at
 is father of the cons Œ of the Œ the 
president, the first president, we had? 
George Washington.
 Wh en he was 15 years 
old, he wrote a book on manners that 
is Œ can be had. 
Now, we have Œ ﬁ
The 
Washington Postﬂ 
has a column ist and she wrote just recently a very great book on 
manners, the ya Œ and once I said, like lubri
cation of your wh eels. At that time very

few people have cars, you know. But so sh
e had a different Œ so these are some  of 
the things that were Œ we were teaching. 
It™s very difficult to 
do it, and you know. 
Q: Thank you fo r Œ for sharing that. Wh
en you first were 
work ing and Œ and 
showing people the 
Montessori
 method,
 
what difficulties did 
you have explaining 
or trying to initiate or introduce the Am
ericans that you were meeting to  this new 
way? 

A: The first time when I was called to 
Mississippi. 
Q: When  was that? 

A: That was in the, I think, early 60s or  something. And it was the War on Poverty, 

which 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know, so we can Œ politically th-the time ca 
[indecipherable]
 exception. So I went to 
Mississippi
 to work with
 poor mo thers 
and Œ and poor ch ildren. The Œ mo st of the 
southerners are Baptists, so Œ and so we 
had Œ the daycare centers that we opened 
for the War on Poverty was in Baptist 
church es. We could not bring kindergarten t
eachers in, or Œ because they don™t want 
to have jo bs and such. So we
 t-tried to train the people 
who lived there. I worked in
 
Naches, Mississippi
, was my first assignment, and at that time, Governor 
Bell
 did 
not Œ he was the governor of 
Mississippi
 and he did not want the Œ the money 
assigned for the president to use it. We ca
me under a different, other th-thing. And 

it was very, very difficult to Œ to teach
 these mothers how they could read 
themselves. I had to teach the mothers 
reading and writing and show them on a 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
14
somewhat basically they could Œ I did no
t know th at I™m all of a sudden a political 
worker because I helped these mothers, a
nd some of their husbands would co me in 
too, to learn to read and write so 
they could do the Œ an -and jo hns Œ not 
Johnson
, 
the 
Kennedys 
used  to come on weekends and help. 
So these people were able to go 
to the polls. And 
I w o rk ed  w ith  
Cha rles Ev ers
, who was the first black mayor to be 
elected in 
Mississippi. 
And was Œ so I became a politic
al worker without realizing 
what just Œ I didn™t know th
at teaching somebody to read 
and write is Œ is a very big 
thing that you™re giving. And ma Œ my  mo
tto is the word against the weapon. If we 
will teach people to read and write, then Œ th
en they don™t need a 
weapon to Œ to get 
some of the things.  
Q: I wanted to know how yo
u got involved with what be
came what you just said, a 
political issue, but I Œ I would like you back
 up just a little bit 
and Œ and go back to 
the late 40s, and the 50s, wh
en Œ when there are a lot of
 things happening, not just 
in your life, but in Œ 
in this society here, and news was coming out in 
Europe
 about 
what had happened 
during the war. Can we go back 
for a little while 
and then come 
Œ we™ll return to the 60s in Œ in a few 
minutes, but can we go back to  the postwar 
period, the immediate  postwar period, 1945
, and can you tell me
 what was going on 
in your life in this country as news
 of what happened to  the Jews in 
Euro pe
 became 
public here? 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
15
A: Well, I d Œ I d Œ I can™t put it 
on dates. I™m Œ I was Œ on the 17
th
 this month, I was 
93 years old. So  you don™t Œ 
your memo ry is not so, on da
tes and so on, I™m not so 
Œ I really Œ well, we opened up the first mo Œ 
Montessori
 training center in Œ in Œ in 
New Jersey
, at one of the universities, they open
ed up to try to train people in 
Montessori.
 And there was 
Nancy Rambush
(ph) arrived, an American who had 
studied the method in Œ in Œ in  
Paris
 and so on. So little by little we started training 
centers, but that was all middle class, 
for mid d le class because it was quite 
expensive and Œ and mo thers began to go to
 work, or they are 
forced, they didn™t 
have husbands, they  had died in  the war, 
whatever. And so most of the Œ some 
people 
[indecipherable]
 started the, you know. 
Q: Approximately when was that? You said
 some of the women had their Œ their 
husbands had been killed in 
the war. When did you star
t some of these training 
programs? 

A: With what program? 
Q: The Œ the 
Montessori 
training. 
A: Well, I really couldn™t tell you exactly th
e Œ the years, but anyway it Œ it Œ really, 
when  the 
Sputnik
 came out in space, 
America
 began to ask themselves, what is 
wrong with our education, that
 the Soviet take us over? 
So, they looked and they  l Œ 
and since
 Montessori
 was the first woman who was as
ked to come to the Œ when 
the war was over in 1918, to the first c
onference in peace, and she wrote a little 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
16
booklet, 
Peace
 
and Education
, and she was very concerned about the peace, you 
know. So we looked Œ 
and then  I went to 
England
 for awhile to take a Œ a training 
course, and I went to different places in Œ in Œ in 
Europe
, you know, for retraining. 
In the beginning we got a lot of teachers from 
India
, because 
Montessori
 was, for 
10 years she was in 
India
, because she was Italian citiz
en and she would not follow 
Œ wh at was the name in Œ I forgot his name
. What? Yeah, mo Œ a
nd then she went to 
Œ to
 Spa in
, and then  she had Œ she would not follow 
[indecipherable]
 the 
directions of, what was his name 
[indecipherable]
. So Œ so we Œ so finally she went 
to 
India
, because when the war broke out the Œ 
as an Italian citizen she had Œ she 
was for 10 years in 
India
, and she became a f-friend with 
Rabindra  Tagore
, the 
first who got the N-Nobel prize 
[indeciphera ble]
 Indian, he wrote books and poetry 
and he was very much involv
ed in peace. And also the 
Indira Gandhi, 
with
 
Gandhi
. He didn't Œ the two of them were not Œ 
Gandhi
 and 
Montessori
 were 
historically living the same time, b u t also
 they shared the whole idea. He was for 
non-violence for adults and she non-violen ce
 for children. At that time, as we see 
and hear it now in th e newspapers and ra
dio, the children were just suffering. 
Perhaps not as much, but they
 were Œ they Œ and when  
they were eight years old 
they went to mines to work 
and so on. So, you see, she was very, very involved in Œ 
in Œ in peace movement. And so , this is very
 important for us in Œ and to do this, 
and that™s why I am so happy that my
 materials and all that is going to 
Vienna, 
yet,

w-we Œ we paid a 
[indecipherable]
 we™ll be able to do 
something towards peace, 
and also that the university, they realize he
re is a Holocaust survivor and what he 
did with that method, you kn
ow, they will know 
something, cause a lot of materials 
and stuff, I™m working with 
these Holocaust interns at
 the museum, they™re from 
Austria
. It™s the fourth one or fifth one that 
I am working, we worked on different 
things, with the 
Montessori
 method and others, how it ca
n be. So that I feel now 
that, of the end of my life, I feel, as 
Montessori
 said, in the servic
e of the child, that 
that will go on. And, but it also Œ it will be
 a separate room where all the materials 
and books are being Œ and films and 
[indecipherable]
 si Œ si Œ many books, 
because textbooks are so much written for th
e upper middle class. O r they are tested 
on th e university, on the professor™s childre
n. But there aren™t books and materials 
for the children who don™t have that back
ground and don™t go to the mu seums and 
all that business.  

Q: You just gave me a lot of information, 
let me just clarify a 
few points. You made 
reference to your Œ your books being colle
cted in a university setting. Can you 
please clarify what that is all about? 

A: Well, I talked all the time with the 
embassy and with the people from Œ these 
interns, the importance of Œ of educati
on and so on. So, I don™t know how it came 
about, but I Œ not only 
that I have my  books, but I have
 200 books, thi 
Œ this Œ that™s 
written by other writers and also 
Montessori
 was not the discoverer of her method, 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

there were two French doc
tors before her. And I went Œ and sh e went to 
Paris, 
it™s 
funny, I went to 
Paris, 
too, to Œ at the same Œ  late
r on. And Œ and I got th-the 
materials on th-these doctors wrote. I have 
Montessori 
books I™m Œ I™m Œ I™m Œ  I 
taught a class in Œ in 
Japan,
 so I have a book on Œ 
Montessori
 book in  Japanese. I 
have the Madonna pain ted on a silk. The Ma
donna is a Japanese, and the holy child 
she™s holding lo oks like a Japanese too, 
and so it shows you how universal that 
method. We Œ I lectured in Œ in  
Israel 
a few times. So you see, 
this is a method that 
has some technical ways to
 teach peace, you know. 
Q: And where are your books be
ing collected for public access? 
A: The books Œ the books are here, and I 
got Œ for instance I got an Œ this is 
Elisabeth 
who you read about,
 Geh rer
. She is the mi Œ Minister of Education in Œ 
in 
Vienna.
 We 
[indecipherable]
 have a librarian, a young librarian from Catholic 
Univ ersity and he comes and he has regist
ered Œ we sent already 14 cartons of 
books to 
Vienna
, films and different materials. 
And the embassy ships this stuff, 
but it™s packed in my apartm
ent and th e different Œ I hope to get some volunteers to 
help, because I have videos and I have a lot 
of material. It™s not only my books, but 
Œ and also, there are other books that teach ers need to read. Now this room that 
they™re opening in 
Vienna
, it™s not gonna be Œ people 
cannot borrow these books, 
it™s they can go and read it th
ere, you see? And so  I hope, you know, that this Œ this 
Holo caust Œ and I™m so happy that, because 
there™s a Œ I don™t know if the plans was

going th rough to  have a Œ stones with the 
names on of the survi Œ of the Holo caust 
victims. 

Q: We have to pause so I can flip the tape. Just one mo ment. 
[break] 
This is a 
continuation of the 
United States 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Lena Gitter
. This is tape one, side
 B.
 Now, you were 
giving me a lot of information about your 
Montessori
 work over the years, and you 
had been telling me about this collection of
 books and films and Œ and other things. 
And I™d like you to Œ to finish telling me 
about that before we go on to the next 
topic. If you could tell me a little bit more 
specifically, where this room, where your 
collection will be housed, 
where exactly is it? Is 
it part of a university? 
A: No, it™s gonna be in th Œ 
Vienna
 Œ I don™t think we have any private universities 
in 
Vienna.
 This is 
[indecipherable] 
which is part of the university, people in early 
childhood education. And th ey have differe
nt libraries, but mine is gonna be a 
special room, and it will have my collecti
on in there, but it™s only people can do 
research there, but they cannot bo
rrow any of the books and so on.  
Q: When do you think that 
this collection will be assemb
led and open to the public? 
A: Well, it™s Œ it™s hard to say 
that, and they would like to, in 
Vienna
 the Dr. 
[indecipherable]
 is in charge of th is particular program, the director. He would like 
maybe by September to Œ but it™s very diffi
cult to get it all shi
pped and packed  and 
Œ and also that you have to have lists, 
and you can™t just go 
on, and Œ so I have

librarian and they so rting, you know, th
e unpublished papers 
and books and Œ and 
magazines and th-the different speeches th
at I have given, or other people, you 
know, that deal with 
Montessori
. So, it™s ga Œ quite a lot of work. I don™t ever have 
any room now to  live in 
my apartment, that™s 
[indecipherable]
 I™m really working 
on th e Œ 
Q: How did this project of, you know, 
with  your co llection being sent to 
Austria
, 
how did this develop? Where did it begin? 
A: Two year ago, a Œ a professor 
and Œ and journalist and so on from 
Graz
, you 
know, in
 Austria
, came, she Œ to the 
United States 
at the Library of Congress. And 
she had heard me speak, and wh en Œ when
 the biography was published and I was 

there to promote it. She heard me speak, 
but she could not come up to Œ there were 
so many people in line, she had to leave. 
So when she came fo
r research she called 
me, and she would like to see me. So I inv
ited her for lunch, and we became friend, 
and she was the one who so rt of said, lis Œ 
it would be a good idea if you would get 
to know a-and get your ma
terial to know in  v Œ in
 Vien na.
 So she sort of started, 
and I was thinking about it, but I really 
did not realize it™s gonna be such a big 
project. So, let™s see. L ast year, the Œ the 
Au strian embassy gave me the Œ the gold 
medal for the work that I did because I wo
rked a lot with thes
e Holocaust interns, 
took them to some of the 
Jewish places, I had them 
for Jewish holidays because 
they have to learn to know how we™re cele
brating them. And also, I Œ on all Œ on all 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
21
the holidays, I Œ I invite them here to a 
little meal, my family a
nd friends, and then I 
invite one or two with Œ of
 the Holocaust, or non-Jewi
sh people to come. And I 
don™t want the people to bring me fl
owers or candy. Everybody has to write 
something about that 
holiday. So, even thes
e Holocaust survivor
s have written very 
interesting things, and I™ve 
taken them to the Temple 
Sinai
 to some Œ so the-they 
learning a lot of Œ of Jewish lif
e, to Œ and to  understand. And 
[indecipherable]
 in 
my  family I have a lot, and two of my  gr
anddaughters are married to non-Jews too, 
you know. So I™m very inte
rested of this understandi
ng, you know. So, I don™t 
know, cause a lot of people come, when  th
ey come to the Holo
caust Museum, they 
come to visit me too, and I 
Œ I lived in different things 
[indeciphera ble]
. But 
anyway, I don™t know exactly, 
but all of a sudden th Œ told
 the Œ one of the attachés 
that I think maybe I have so many books,
 perhaps they  would be interested in 
Vienna
 to get it. So he asked me
, and he made sort of a te
mporary list and send it to 
Vienna
. And th ey were very happy, and so th
ey have already 14 
boxes, and that™s 
just with books and then films, an d vi
deos and I have hundred s of beautiful 
photography of the poor people in 
Mississippi
 and in  
New Eng land, 
and different 
places, and it Œ it opens the world 
to the people here and in 
Vienna
 too, because 
they Œ th ey only think 
America
 is you know, the Œ the ri
ch country , you know, it Œ 
on th e 
Fifth 
Av enue, or 
Ma d i son
 Avenue, whatever they se
e. So that Œ I™m taking 
that movie attitude away from other peopl
e. So we started,
 and I looked for 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
22
somebody to  help with the packing, and 
I got this young libra
rian at Catholic 
University who is very interested, and 
when he™s off he co
mes and works a few 
hours and packs a thing. And th en the embassy ships it.  
Q: I™d like to go back to 
your work  in the War on Poverty, wh en you went in the 
1960s to 
Mississippi.
 How did it happen th at you got 
involved with this particular 
program, and left your home and did this? 
A: Well, I Œ a lot of people in 
Montessori 
knew me and some people got in volved  
in Œ in these different issues and Œ in 
America
. And I got a phone call one day, 
would I come to 
Mississippi
 and introduce a little bit of 
Montessori?
 So I went 
down, and at that time in 
Mississi ppi 
there were different 
[indecipherable]
 
Montessori
, some people were from other univers
ities with specialties in Œ in Œ in 
their field. So, what Œ we were hi
red by the, I th-think one of the 
Kennedy™s
 
brother-in-law, I don™t know, he was in ch
arge. Anyway, we were paid. So we got 
to 
Mississi ppi
, and my  husband, and we felt th
is is an opportunity to  repay 
something to 
America. 
And wh en I got to 
Naches, Missi ssippi
, I Œ I Œ one of the in 
Œ newspapers came down fo r an interview,
 one of the Catholic paper. And Œ a-and 
in there I didn't even remember, b u t 
in there I had said I felt when in 
Mississippi 
that I™m back in Œ under 
Hitler
, you know, the way th ings 
were going. And then  to 
come to my hats. I wore hats because I can
™t always comb my hair so well. So I 
wore hats, and I have 
different hats. And the 
Ku Klux Klan
 was very  mu ch behind 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
23
me, they didn't want us to come in to 
teach the blacks. But I heard from some body 
who was friends with  the 
Ku Klux Klan
 too, said we can™t take Œ we don™t Œ 
Hitler
 
didn™t want that little Jewish woman, we can™t do it either, because everybody 
knows her by her hats. So that was a Œ that
 sort of saved me from being killed by 
the klan. 
Q: And every time I™ve seen you,
 you™ve had a different hat. 
A: Right. So  people, some people when  
they go on a trip, my
 grandchildren or 
something, they bring me Œ I have chapeaux
 from all over the world. And there is a 
Œ a place here in the 
United States, 
they have only Œ a Œ a woman has a shop only 

with hats. I shouldn™t nor Œ ne
ed to  go there, and see what I don™t have. S-So  Œ but I 
didn™t stay the whole time, you see, in 
Mississippi
, I did work  and to train them, 
and I would fly back  to 
Wa sh ingto n
, then go down again 
for a week. And so it 
wasn™t that I continuously 
stayed there. But you see, my  teaching and Œ and th e 
politic was Œ was one thing.
 Because like I worked in
 Na ches
 with the poor people 
who didn't know how to  read, an-and Œ and 
Cha rles Ev ers
, he was Œ he was from 
Nach es
 too, and he was running for an office
. So he Œ sometimes I was up here with 
him, you know, on Œ when  he Œ when  he
 was Œ spoke somewhere, or we have 
catfish, or 
[indeciphera ble]
 and stuff. So that Œ you kn
ow, so I Œ I appeared and I 
was some help, you know, the 
[indecipherable]
 thing, and he was elected not 
because just of me 
[in d ecipherable]
. But I was then at the 
Œ what™s the city, the 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
24
capital city, when he was elected. Bu
t we did not Œ our checks came from a 
different group, not from Œ from the state of
 Mississippi,
 you know. So many, many 
things I somehow adopted that 
Montessori
 method and I have to rewrite a lot to 
understand their backgrounds 
and their needs and so on. 
And it was very difficult in 
the beginning because these mo
thers wouldn't sleep or clea
n up. They said, oh don™t 
I know that they don™t have
 to do these slav
e type work ? And I 
said, you know, but 
still, you know, we have to clean up. An
d then  I called the Œ here the national 
gallery of art and ask the cur Œ one of the 
curators in education, could he send me 
some paintings that glorify work ? And he 
did. And so we hung it in the different 
classrooms, and so th ey Œ the ﬁG irl with a Broomﬂ by 
Rembrandt
, they realized 
now the Œ somehow, without having ev er 
been  to a mu seum, 
they knew that 
paintings are something very  precious. And Œ and 
[indecipherable]
 and different 
paintings and we had it in the classroom
s. And i-it Œ during th at time, War on 
Poverty, they were, you know, the se-sen
ators and congressmen and people wo uld 
come to 
Mississippi
 and they would come to visit 
these centers. And Œ and we Œ I 
taught them the name s of these paintings
 and Œ on th e Œ and so when these pa Œ 
people came, and these pro-professors a
nd so, and painting, and Œ and she could 
say, oh this is, the name of the painting, 
say something. All of a sudden that little 
black wo man without any art education was at
 the same level as th e senator or the 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
25
[indecipherable]
 and she knew. So the arts plays a stellar role too, in the many 
things that I have done in the art.  
Q: When  you said they  sent you paintings
, they sent you wh at, copies? What Œ did 
they send you posters?  What
 did they send you actually
, when  you requested th is 

for this Œ for the classroom? 

A: They sent in Œ th e educational division
 at the national gallery, or most of them 
have an education department. They send me 
slides and they send
 me, not too large, 
but anyway, reproductions, you know.  

Q: I also want you to clarify some thing you said a few moments ago. You said that 

being in 
Mississippi
 was like being back  under
 Hitler
. Could you please clarify 
what you meant by that? 

A: Well, the fear that Œ that 
people had, to Œ to go to a cer
tain store. For instance, in 
Vienna
 when I was going in stores that belong
ed to so me of Jewish people, I didn't 
have look. I had braids, and Œ and a Œ they
 would say, fräulein,
 you can™t go in to 
that, the Nazis would tell me  you can™t go into
 the store, because they  thought I Œ y-

you know, that™s only for Je
wish people, you know. And we could not be out at Œ 
very late in the evening, and you couldn™t 
go into Œ to  a movie, or you couldn™t Œ 
and it was the same thing, 
because the blacks, you coul
d go only on the Œ some of 
the gallery 
[indecipherable]
. And they couldn™t sit in a Œ a restaurant. I mean, the 
things that were done 
to us in Œ in Œ under
 Hitler
, these conditions existed there. So 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
26
I was able, you know, and then  I wo
rk ed with Œ with others, not only 
Mississi ppi
, 
with other states, flying in, and I wrot
e papers and I wrote little pamp hlets and 
different things to help the people to Œ to
 learn. And I was so happy to see that Œ 
what™s that comedian, that black on e? He lost his Œ his son was killed? 
Q: 
Bill Cosb y
? 
A: Yeah. I Œ I was on a program years ago 
with him at Œ on special education for 
black chil Œ what he has written now, book
s for children to read, and Œ and they 
have Œ they have 
[indecipherable]
 they have blacks and Œ and it™s so important that 
children find something where 
they can relate to, what 
not Œ you know, the father 
coming home with the attaché, you know. An
d wh en th e children are asked they  say 
they don™t Œ no, my father doesn ™t do anythi
ng, he goes with the 
Œ with that attaché 
case, you know. So  Œ so  from what I have 
done over the years was an example for 
some other daycare centers and places to
 Œ to use and how to
 teach adults, you 
know, that™s all. 

Q: When you were working in 
Mississippi
, and Œ and starting to speak to people, 
did you ever tell them ab
out your experiences in 
Euro pe
? 
A: Very little, there either. Th
ey were so, when e Œ so  po
or enough, and to Œ and the 
things they had to do, 
they really did not have time. Ju
st Œ just to be eight hours in 
that day care center, and then I had them pa
int and clean up, because they were an 
awfully messy and Œ and dirty, these places
. And so we didn't  
have any money for 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

27
painting, but the people came early in the mo
rning. They had to open at eight, or 
they would come at six and paint these da
y care centers and sc
rub floors and Œ and 
we made waste baskets and Œ an d we made
 bookshelv es, getting 
Œ at that time you 
still could get boxes, you know, crates wh
ere apples came, they were very well 
done, I Œ as a matter of fact I had them for years as bookcases in my  first apartment 
in 
United States. 
So, we were so involved
 with their own life that they did not have 
time to Œ 
Q: You said that you noticed a parallel be
tw een your experience and what they were 
going th rough. Did anybody ever ask you 
why are you doing this kind of wo rk ? 
A: No. 

Q: You were going from 
Missi ssi ppi
 back  to 
Washington? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And back and forth. What were your 
thoughts at the time about the American 
social order, based on your perspective as a refugee? 
A: Well, I Œ it Œ I traveled mostly with 
Œ with educators and 
so on, along with 
physicians, so I don™t know really, I™m Œ one
 is so involved in what else was going 
on and we didn™t talk too mu ch  ab
out our past either, you know.  
Q: Who else was working with you? Y
ou said you were work ing with other 
educators, but were there ot
her people who were coming from
 Washington
 or from 
the big cities to work with you, 
or were you goin g on your own? 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
28
A: Most of the time I went on my own, and met some  people from Œ from other 
states or from other universitie
s or colleges and so on.  
Q: You mentioned 
Kennedy. 
Did you have any contact with 
Kennedy
? 
A: Yeah, because they used to come to 
Naches 
on weekends with  their airplane and 
they would help the people,
 you know, prepare them too for Œ for their rights. I 
wasn™t so invol Œ 
you know, I wasn™t 
politishin
(ph) involved  or no, you know, with 
the rights, or wh at in Œ people need to kno
w, or you know, to get to the polls, and 
people are very much afra
id, you know, too. So the 
Kennedys
 would bring a lot of 
students down, too. And you know, the peop
le that sent it, the students who were 
not dressed well on the campground, they  said
, look, we are dirty, we want models 
of people who are dressed properly and combed and so on. 

Q: Which 
Kennedys? 
A: Oh, I don™t rememb er their names now. You™re asking me t Œ hundreds and 

thousands of names it seems.  
Q: You worked also with 
Jimm y Carter.
 Can you tell me how you met and started 
working with President 
Carter
? 
A: Well, I Œ I™m a me mb er of the Women™s National Demo cratic club, and when 

Carter
 
was running for office i-
in Œ where was it, in 
Pennsylvania
 and a couple of 
other states, the Republicans had the majority 
[indecipherable]
. So the Œ I don™t 
know how th e club arranged wh at they calle
d the Peanut Brigade. They had I th ink 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

about four or five very huge buses, and 
they  had banners, they were called the uni Œ 
and 
[indecipherable]
 you know, that you could t-ta
lk, you know, on the different, 
and they were asking some Œ they Œ we ha
d a lot of young students, political science 
from the different universities, but they 
also ask for some volunteers, you know, 
teachers and so on. So I didn
™t know exactly what I coul
d do, but I thought I™ll go. 
And that was a very wonderful experience, 
to go to th e different places and talk to 
the teachers of their importance in educating 
the children that they will be able to Œ 
to go to 
[indecipherable]
 and so on. So, we stoppe
d at different, you know, 
wherever th ere was some Œ some monumen
t, we si Œ had to stop there, the 
newspaper come, and we had 
Œ I still have that shirts with their whole Œ with 
Carter
 and so on. So, when  he Œ when  he wa
s elected we were invited specially to 
the White House and stuff. A
nd then he was the first one
 who got Œ when my bi Œ 
biography came out and he was in 
Vienna
, so  the president gave him a book of the 
Œ a Œ the Œ we work ed with Œ with Mrs. 
Carter
 a lot, but n-not her Œ really so much 
with him, I mean, I was there and so, but Œ 
Q: You mentioned your biogr
ap hy. Why don™t you take a mo ment now and tell me 
about your biography. 
A: A f Œ a few friends and I 
have organized a little German
 club, and so we meeting 
once Œ once a month. And one day a Mrs. 
Schroeder
 came, and she is a journalist 
and so is her husband. And she came to th
e German club and said, I know I don™t

need to learn German, however I want to 
know wh at ma kes you guys get togeth er 
and speak German, you know. And somehow, 
after a year or so she was there Œ she 
asks her husband, and she as
ked me did I want to do a book, because from what I 
was saying at the club, or somehow she thou
ght that I have Œ we Œ I had a story to 
tell. So we did. So it was a Œ quite a de
cision, and also you 
know, I did not Œ I 
hadn™t planned, you know, an
d Œ and a lot of dates and stuff like you are asking me. 
I™m a Œ mathematics w asn™t my
 strong forte. So, it was 
v-very difficult, but as a 
journalist, I mean like he went to  Œ they went to 
Vienna
 when  they  were doing the Œ 
and they  found the co ffee shop wh ere I went to, and they  found the schools I went 
to, and th ey brought photographs
 and Œ and they got i-in Œ 
Austria  
pu-published 
every year, every month wh at™s happening 
and every day. So he fo und th e 1905, 
what in July , had happened
, you know. And th ere were similar things being Œ we 
will want now 
[indecipherable]
 that. And some from newspaper they were Œ I have 
an awful lot of newspaper clippings, cause
 wherever I was, somehow there was an 
interview on Œ in so me newspapers, so Œ we
 could establish some days where I went 
or wh at I did, you know, from the newspape
r clippings. But this Œ my memory is 
not so Œ so good any mo re. In
 particular for dates. But, 
as I say, what Œ they were 
able, you know, to search through newspa
pers, and si Œ and th ere are some books 
and there™s a chapter or so
mething about me said in 
Œ in th ere, on th e War on 
Poverty people who wrote books, so in se
veral books was something about me or

my  work , you know, so Œ so th at™s how
 it came. It took a long time, and Œ but 
unfortunately it isn™t translated into Eng
lish yet. That bothers my  grandchildren 
because they never learned 
any German because my daug
hter was so Œ she would 
not want to have
 her ch ildren on 
Hitler™s
 language. So Œ so the Œ course there™s not 
enough on 
Montessori 
in there, and Œ well, you can™t 
di Œ you know, write so much 
when you live a long life as 
I did, and Œ but I was so fo
rtunate as a title, it Œ the 
book, I was very lucky that what I did, 
it was a success, you know. And had so me Œ 
everybody lives a life and has some sad things, but 
c™est la vie
, and it doesn™t have 
to Œ just to sit and Œ and feel sorry for one
self, that I lost my daughter and I had to 
take care of my  grandchildren. But I™m ve
ry lucky, they  all did not go on drugs, 
they finished their educati
on, they are married, they 
have children and they are 
work ing and I can be very happy with th
at. And that my work that I did is 
successful Œ was very succe
ssful in that it™s a Œ a 
[indecipherable]
 and we™ll find a 
place and I feel in a way it will constantly
 remind people when 
they go there to 
visit, that this Jewish woman was a Holo
caust Œ what the Holocaust room, even if 
they will not have everybody™s name, but so
mehow I feel with the videos and with 
th-the Œ everything is going to be there, 
that it will be some Œ in paying something 
back that I did not suffer. But 
I feel it Œ that the work that I have done that is being Œ 
being used, it will tell the story of these pe
ople that I did not k
now and that had to 
suffer and Œ and die such a terrible death. So 
I feel that really I have to be grateful

particular to 
Spielberg
 that his first video that made me feel I have some spot in 
that history and I have done something with 
my life, an d that I have in some way, is 
Œ is Œ I wanted to dedicate this memorial 
to these people that Œ that I don™t know, 
and some names I know. But I always wanted wh en th ey were talking ab out a stone 
wall with the names, the people in 
Vienna
 have such magnifi
cent build ings and 
museums. People on Œ spent 
a lot of money will not go to
 that that. But the Œ the 
young teachers who will come
 to that, or people to 
do research will somehow 
remember, because I have a lot of materi
als from the Holocaust Museum, they were 
used, from the educational department. I Œ it™s Œ it™s going to 
Vien na
 too, you 
know, to that museum, yeah. 
Q: Before I let you go further I want Œ I wa
nt to ask you a few 
questions. Could you 
please tell me the full name of your book an
d the name of the author Œ your autobi Œ 
your Œ your biography,
 not an autobiography. 
A: Yeah. That™s ﬁ
Das Grosse Glück, der Lena
 Lieba Gitter Rosenblattﬂ 
by 
Peter Schroeder
. Now, the Œ they used 
my  maid en  n ame to o .  As a matt er o f  fact 
the publisher wanted only 
my  maid en  n a me b e cau se 
Gitter
 is not Je wish enough 
for him, they wanted a very Jewish
 title. So then he 
wanted to leave 
Gitter
 out, but 
I said, you know, if I™m 
Œ if he™s gonna leave 
Gitter
 out, I have a lot of books and 
I™m Œ if people Œ they will not remember 
th e title that book, 
but if they punch 
Gitter
 
at the 
Library of Co ng ress,
 some of my materials will 
jump up and they will find

33
me. But if he doesn™t 
have that, then Œ so 
[indeciphera ble]
. But I think constantly, 
it somewhat was a good choice because I™m 
always lucky to find some people or 
some people find me to do things with
 Œ that I™m intere
sted in to do. 
Q: I wanted to ask you when  you lost
 your daughter, and how old was she? 
A: I don™t know the date right now, can 
you imagine? It™s something, you know Œ i-
i Œ some dates you really don™t want to rememb er, so Œ it™s about 15 years now, I 

think.  
Q: I also wanted to Œ to 
ask you about your husband, yo
u haven™t mentioned him in 
a while.  
A: Well, he died 1974. But he su pported me
 with my work, and he
 ab Œ some of his 
colleagues would say, you™re 
making enough money and you let 
Lena
 travel around 
to 
Mississi ppi
 and Œ and 
[indecipherable]
 and all these different places. And I 
went out of the country too, you know, to 
Japan
, I went to 
Alaska
 
[indecipherable]
. But he said that™s Œ he wanted me to have my  job and my  
position because he said men die before wo
men, and so you will have something. 
When  he was 40 years old he bought a book , teach your wife how to be a widow 

because he said why he Œ why he Œ the 
statistics, you know, me
n die before women 
because 
[indecipherable] 
we™re gonna die before them.

Q: You mentioned also a Holo caust memo rial in 
Vienna
. You have told me about 
this in the past, about your work  towa
rds some kind of Ho locaust memo rial. Did 
you want to elaborate further on that? 
A: No, th ere isn Œ there isn™t one yet. I don™t know if they did agree. Some Br-
British designer or architect. But I 
don™t know. We were involved, 
Schroeder
 and 
several of us from the two Œ we fought 
for the location and also we Œ we wrote 
letters to newspapers and so  on, because 
we felt a museum that just go there an-and 
touch names, it has to have something to wa
lk in, for children to learn and to have 
proof, but ti Œ ti Œ having th e names there, I didn™t think th is is Œ so I don™t know 
wh-what is happening with that. 
Q: Are you actively involved in  this as an issue? 
A: In what? 

Q: In this Holocaust
 memo rial i n  Œ  in  
Austria
, are you involved? 
A: No, I Œ I™m not involved but from reading in the papers and Œ an d the Œ th Œ th e 
Austrians don™t want it there, they want 
it somewhere else, you know. And I ag Œ I 
agree with the Au strians, if at all, but 
it should have something wh ere people would 
go in  and have books, have photographs, 
have something that know what happened 

in, but they were coming to Œ to 
Vienna, 
th-they run to the mu seum, and the Œ all 
the ar Œ the beautiful architecture, they 
will not go there. And these names will not 
mean anything to so me of them.

Q: You became involved in the War on Pove
rty and with the Peanut Brigade. Did 
you get involved  with any othe
r social causes? The war in 
Vietnam
 or the 
Women™s Movement? 
A: I was involved in  so many things, you know. Practically with all Œ with 
Carter
, 
you know, I was involved in. And 
you know, I moved in the day 
Carter 
went to the 
White Ho use. And a Œ they didn™t want me 
to, it was a special holiday, and I re Œ I 
composed a letter on this historic day that a President 
Carter
 moves to the White 
House, 
Lena Gitter
 moves to the 
Chevy Chase 
House and this is my  address, 
telephone numb er, please get in touch with
 me, come to see me . And the Œ I didn™t 
have the post office send th em
 the change of address. So
 I™m very involved with 
them, in 
[indecipherable]
. So you sometimes, th-the Œ 
the names, even while I™m 
speaking, di-di Œ disappear.  

Q: Would you like to  take a break for a few minutes? 

A: Okay . 
[break] 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Lena Gitter
. This is tape two, side
 A. 
And we 
just had a little bit of a break. I wanted to 
ask you about some of the things that we 
didn™t cover yet.  

A: Sure.

Q: I wanted to ask you to go back  to 19
45 - ™46, the immediate postwar period in 
the 19 fo r Œ late 40s and ask you what 
was going on in your life and in your 

immediate society here when news of 
the genocide reached the American public. 
A: Oh, I really don™t remember exactly, 
but we were happy some of the family  
memb ers came back, and a lot of people somehow, always stopped in Œ in  

Washin gton 
with us and to ld us some of the e
xperiences they had. But I d-don™t Œ I 
a-absolutely cannot remembe
r, y ou know. I wasn™t politically so involved in . Of 
course, we had Œ we knew a lot ab out the 
Nuremberg
 trials becau se some Œ a 
young friend of ours, he was a c
ourt reporter and he was in the 
Nuremberg
 trials, 
so when he came back he to
ld us different things and 
so on. And here was a Œ a 
nurse. Sh e passed away, she™s Œ was visiting 
Œ I mean, she was staying here too, and 

she was at the 
Nuremberg
 trials, and she was assigned to take care of 
Eichmann Œ 
Eichma nn?  
And Œ no, not 
Eichmann
, another. And she was a nurse for him, and 
he was a Œ a t Œ he Œ he was hanged. But 
the day he was senten
ced, in the morning 
she was called, she gave him his bath. An
d there was always a military man with 
her. And then she Œ he called her, she has a 
headache Œ he had a head ache, she gave 
him aspirin, and two hours later he Œ he wa
s ha-hanged. So she to ld some of these 
things, but I really Œ I don™t know with wh
at, I was so involved with other things.  
Q: Did you follow with any 
involvement really, the partition vote for the state o f
 
Israel,
 the partition of 
Palestine? 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
37
A: A lot in Œ in my family 
were involved 
in Œ in Œ in 
Israel
, and we had a lot of 
immediate family who lived in 
Israel 
and were very involved in  the whole 
[indecipherable]
. That was Œ it™s just everything™
s so mixed together now that I 
can™t separate the way you do now, you 
know. Maybe a few years ago I could have 
done it, but not Œ 
not any mo re now. 
Q: You mentioned earlier about
 your Austrian citizenship
. Can you share that with 
me now? 
A: That was about two years or three year
s ago. I-I really d-don™t know exactly how 
it came but I read somewhere in these Œ I got 
ﬁDer Gemeindeﬂ
 from
 Vienna, 
this 
is a newspaper, magazine comes out ev
ery month, that people can get their 
citizenship back. So  I applied and I Œ I got 
it back and they had a very lovely party 
for me at th e embassy, too. And because I fe
lt that I will be able to vote, I will be 
able to say something of wh at I don™t like or
 what could be done
. So we discussed, 
we have meetings, and the attachés and ever
ybody is very helpfu l and trying to Œ to 
understand, you know, what 
had happened, because the people don™t realize why, 
politically 
Austria
 w-was not considered that they owe us money like some of the 
other countries, you know? So people th
ink they™re getting out, getting aw ay. We 
got a little bit money now from. 
And we hope to get a Œ the 
paintings that they sold, 
the Œ they found, you know, a 
lot of paintings in one of 
the church basements. And 
so there are all these o w ners, so most of
 them have died, and so Œ so they are 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
38
planning to give us a little bit of money, 
some of the older people, you know, so I 
don™t know, I hope I™ll Œ I™ll get a little bit 
money, I could use it. See, with that 
German club, we got involved in  so many 
people coming, discussing things about 
education, which is very important, we ha
ve to ask ourself, what Œ and n-not only 
Gentiles, Jewish too, what have we done 
that s Œ people could 
grow up and 
being so  
terrible? We have to learn from what has ap
a Œ gone on in Œ in Œ in past. And Œ and 
being hateful, you don™t really achi
eve anything, you have Œ it™s very 
[indecipherable]
 to know wh at has happened, but 
you have to try to see if you can 
make them understand 
and the resp onsibility that all 
of us have towards a peaceful 
world. It™s not 
only the Gentiles, their job,
 it™s ours too, you know. 
Q: I wanted to ask you how your experien
ce as a Jewish refugee influenced the 
choices that you made
 during your life. 
A: I don™t understand your que
stion, would you repeat it? 

Q: I wanted to know ho-how your experi
ence as a refugee, 
a Jewish refugee has 
influenced  the choices that you made in your life. 

A: Well, I don™t Œ I really don™t Œ don™
t know, because I Œ I was so little with Œ 
really, in my work I was ve
ry little with Jewish people
, you know? So I Œ I™m Œ I 
really, you n Œ and ca Œ I cannot Œ everyon
e™s involved in Jewish circles too, 
because in the Œ in 
Washington
, th-th Œ there were very
 few docto rs too, in Œ 
Jewish docto rs, or t Œ or doctors who ha
d come from Œ from the 
Holo caust. One of 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
39
the doctors that came then a
nd worked at Œ in the hospita
l with my husband. But we 
were not so in-involved in it, the type of 
patients and the ty-type 
of the hospitals and 
the docto rs and ev erything.  
Q: What changes Œ what positiv
e changes have you seen in 
America
 over the years 
since you™ve been living here? 
A: Well, it™s a Œ made tremendous prog
ress in technology and Œ and a lot of 
freedom. But th-the Œ th e Œ the program w
ith the Œ with the poor people and the Œ 
and the education, that is still Œ they™re 
trying but we haven™t Œ we really haven™t 
done anything. And also we ha
ve to study what has become of the children of these, 
particularly of these very big shots Nazi
s? Their children are grown, they have 
children now too. How Œ there are some bo
oks written about them, but we have to 
ask how their feeling is, and wh at Œ wh at 
they want, what we haven™t Œ there™s one 
thing we did neglect, I think, to take care
 in some way of these children. Because 
they are the one who might really feel
 that they could be Nazis again. 
[break] 
Q: I™m sorry, we were interrupted by so me
one who just walked in. We™re back now, 
please continue. You were Œ 
you were saying about what
 we™ve neglected was to 
pay attention to the Œ the grandc
hildren of th e Nazi big shots. 
A: The children and the grandchildren now.
 We haven™t done Œ some when their 
fathers were executed and so 
on Œ these children, in a Œ 
in a sense they were not 
responsib le what their fathers did. And we
 have not turned a little b it to see what 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
40
could be done, because
 we Œ we haven™t Œ 
we haven™t helped them. And it™s still Œ 
some research mu st be going on because 
these children and grandchildren can grow 
up being hateful and continue that. So it™s 
not only, you know, we have to reach out 
for the Œ the victim, and yeah , the non-vi
ctims, like the Œ one wrote a book, very 
famous. I can™t think about his name, an 
Austrian. Not the Œ not the one who kills 
you, but the one who was killed.
 How Œ how is his resp onsibility 
[indeciphera ble]
 
you know? It™s Œ in
 German it sounds 
[indecipherable]
 taught about the theater, 
you know, it™s Œ is responsible too. So , th
ere is Œ education mu st study mu ch  mo re 
wh-w hat had happened to these people. Wh
ere have they gone, wh at was going on 
with them. 
Q: I™d like you to reflect back on your 
life and tell me w h at 
do you think has been 
the greatest contribution that you made to
 America
? 
A: Well, that I was able to teach many to 
read and Œ and write. I invited my child™s 
[indecipherable]
 invited him to one of the conferences, 
Montessori
 conferences as 
a speaker, you know, to come. 
So, to see that im Œ it w as 
very much for us, but for 
him too, and for the other, to see the in Œ im
portance that he Œ even  he doesn™t have 
the academic education, but what he coul
d do for people, you 
know? And this is 
very important. When  I had the Œ the 90
th
 birthday, and that embassy gave a party. 
So I invited the chef, we had a black chef 
and I invited some of these people who Œ 
who bath ed me, or feed me or do things, 
to sh Œ and they were all in different 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
41
costumes and different nati
onalities and a lot of black ones. To see Œ and I didn't 
invite so much of that wh
ite staff because they™re collecting the Œ the checks and 
stuff like that. But to show
, you know, how w-we are 
dependent on Œ on th e non-
academia to keep us a
live and going. And so 
America
 has an Œ a long way to  go 
too, to accept, you know, other nationalities,
 because we have 
here, right in the 
Chevy Chase
 house, right, a United Nations now.
 You have seen different customs 
and different languages, and 
they have to learn to wo rk  togeth er and to Œ and 
they™re poor Œ some have very poor Eng
lish language. And you learn then Œ when  
you go to  English classes, you 
don™t learn, give me eggs 
over on, or Œ or make my  
bass this way, or you know th Œ th is Œ ev
ery day vocab ulary is not
 taught for people, 
you know. So they  have a difficult Œ we
 have a difficult time to understand them 
[indecipherable]
. So I™ll Œ I don™t know, I mean it Œ there™s so many changes in 
that Œ just in the medical technology becaus
e in my  family is so many doctors. And 
my husband was a physician and my 
grandson. I mean, from the Œ the little 
thermo meter in your mouth now 
[indecipherable]
 you know. And the Œ the 
medical technology is incred
ible, you know, that we have
 now. And food and so on. 
But more and more we have to learn th-the
 Œ that we™re the brother™s keeper and the 
responsib ility that each of us have, the one
 that Œ who is preparing that Œ with 
canning, that he is Œ really everything 
is clean, because we don™t know now who 
cans, or who builds that car, 
so many people, who is respons
ib le? So each of us, we 

 
Interview with LenaGitter  
 
July 21, 1998 
 

 
 
42
have to teach much more resp
onsibility, that I can die beca
use you forgot to put this 
and that into  the food, or Œ or you put
 something in  Œ on Œ in my  car, that, you 
know, would Œ would not driv
e right, and it™s Œ so this 
new technology
 has brought 
a lot of responsibility too, th
at has to be taught in a 
way to the children too, you 
know. 
Q: I wanted to ask, what™s still on the hor
izon for you? What 
Œ what things would 
you like yet to accomplish? 
A: Well, I would like to see all th at 
material and stuff to Œ to go to 
Vienna
 and get 
in place. When you get my ag
e you just want to be like 
Gandhi
, he only wanted his 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ and his bible and his Œ wh at
 do you call that, the one wheel 
Œ you Œ spinning wh eel. My grandchildren 
said the spinning wheel is an antique 
now, that would be too costly for me to 
Œ for them to buy it for me. You know, I Œ 
everything becomes very diffi
cult. I had a professor in 
Vienna
 in psychology, and 
he said, once a man, twice a child. Of cour
se at that time he didn't know ab out 
women™s liberation. And I feel that we™re
 really like children,
 you know, if I™ll 
forget wh ere I put it and Œ and you know, a
nd that brings me that research is now 
going on how 
Montessori
 can be used for 
Alzheimer 
patient. So there™s some  of 
the things that we are teaching the young 
children would be very
 helpful to Œ as a 
matter of fact, I™m meeting in a couple days
, somebody is coming with student rep Œ 

 
Interview with LenaGitter

research and so I Œ I don™t 
know, I always get involved in
to something, that™s easy. 
I don™t have to plan it, I have the time. 
Q: There are many things that we obviousl
y didn™t cover today. Is there anything 
that you wanted to ad d? Anything else that
 you wanted to talk about that Œ that we 
didn™t cover already? 

A: Well, I really don™t know. I would like to
 Œ the Œ as I say, there™s some of these 
things that we mo re Œ mo re covered, and mo
re Œ it™s Œ it™s nice that the mu seum and 
all that, but the educational department, I th
ink, should  be in Œ mo re en-enlarged, 
some mo re money has to go to Œ to ward s 
the education, I think it™s Œ that™s my 

criticism fo r the Holocaust Museum. But all 
the volunteers in my
 family, they are 
hooked on th at. The Œ the days
 they Œ they  go there and th
ey Œ they  don™t want to 
miss it, it™s Œ it™s a wonderful 
[indecipherable]
. Well, thank you for giving me an 
opportunity to Œ to speak, bu
t it™s Œ it™s just too Œ too mu
ch for me to cover now.  
Q: I want to thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. And this 
concludes the interview Œ the 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Lena Gitter. 
Thank you very mu ch. 
A: Thank you very much.
