Rae, thank you som uch for joining us today and being will ing to beour
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
.  
W ehave justan hour,so we won't be able tocover ever ything, but Iknow that you'll share 

with us as muchas you possibly can in thistim e.  And we're going to startf irst, though, Rae, 

with before we talk about the war andthe Holocaust, tellus a little bit about your lif ebefore 

the war, your fam ily, your com munity, what it was like.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  I lived in a very sm all town wh ich was on the Russian border.  Poland 
was a democracy at the time.  Dokszyce hadliberated the area andPoland becam ea 

democracy. W e were on the border with Russia. T he town was like four kilometersf rom  the 

Russian border andthere was a m ilitary installation thereof the Polish Arm y.  Life was ver y 

pleasant. Asfar as I rem ember Ihad all theconveniences and lived in a household that had a 

lot of help.  Bothm y parents were in business.  My m otherhad afabric store andm y father 

3 
 
was supplying
 
the Army gar rison andalsoexporting to Germany.  Life was good and I started 
an early education. I had a nanny, or at that tim ethey calledthem agoverness, thattaught 
m eto readand to speak Hebrew and, of course, Polishand the native language there
 
wa s  
Belarus. I did not expect tobe in the circum stancesthat eventually evolved.  My f ather died in 

1937 after atrip to the Germ an border to deliver some goods.  At that time there were some 

Jews that were deported f rom  Germany, Polish Jews that were c
onsidered non
-
c it ize n s .   
T hey cam e tobetter their lives in Germ any because it was a muchmore progressive country 

andthey were deported when the Hitler regim e came into power.  He went to visit them  and 

got some sortof an infection.  Could notf ind the
 
--
 
any medicationfor it, couldnotf ind any 
helpfor him, andhedied.  My m other tookover both businesses and was ver y much engaged 

in the business. Needless to say, m y upbringing was m ostly by the help in thehouse. So 

was m y brothers.  My brother was three years younger
 
--
 
three or four
 
--
 
between three or four 
years younger thanm e.  The war broke out 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: Rae,one other questionbefore we turn tothe war.  Your father, as I 
said, died when you were young.  Do youhave m emories of him
? 
Rae Goldf arb:  Only the memory of the picture and I remember certain incidents. I 
know he was tall because when he putm e on his shoulders I alm ost reached the chandelier 

and was ahigh ceiling.  The reason I rem em ber that is because electricity was installed in the 

house, which wasn't very prevalent in that part of  Poland.  AndI rem em ber that particular 

incident.  Other than that, I remember very littl e of m yf ather.
 
Bill Benson: And I was going to alsoask you,tell us about the interactions between 
your f am ily and other Jews with the Christiancomm unity in Dokszyc e.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W ell, both m y parents were in business, so they hada lotof contact 
with thef arm  population.  The general population hadtobuy fabrics in order tom ake their 

clothes.  T
hey didn't go toa department store like you do now.  And mother not justhad a 
store but she also distributed to smaller stores.  She did kindof  wholesaling because she 

would buy thefabrics in bolts and needless to say it was toom uchfabric for her store, so she 

would sell it to other stores. 
 
T hef arm ers would com eand the generalpopulationf rom  town wo uld com etobuy the 
fabrics.  Asf ar as I can remem ber she was the onlyf abric store in the town and inthe 

surrounding area. 
 
My f ather, again,had a lot of contactbecause hebought upproduce, hebought up 
animals, he was invol ved inthe slaughterof anim alsand providing themeatf orthe Polish 

Arm y, and supplied the m eat alsof orthe Jewi sh population.T herewas a quota.  You could 

only slaughter som uchf or the Jewish population which requiredaspecial way of  slaughter.  

He got around it by having it all slaughtered the humane way which would consider the way 

the Jews are required to slaughterananim also it doesnot suffer and the town was ver y 

prosperous. There were between2,500and3,000 Jews in the town and generalpopulation 

of  the town was about6,000. Aid lot of  interaction with the com munity outsidebecause I 

rem em ber taking m atza to the Greek orthodox 
--
 
well, he called them  the (saying foreign 
word).  I guess he was calling the priest.  And he would give m ehoney.  He was producing 

honey.  AndI rem em ber decorating a Christm as tree with afam ily in the
 
--
 
anoutlying vi ll age.  
T he ornaments that were m ade was to makea hole at the top 
to have egg and the bottom  of  

theegg and blow out the contentsandthen paint af ace on it,attach a hat with a string to 

hang on the Christmas tree.
 
Bill Benson:  You remem berthat.
 

4 
 
Rae Goldf arb:  I rem em berthat.  Silly things I remember. Important things I'm not so 
sure.
 
Bill Benson: Septem ber 1, 1939, Germ any invades Poland, startingworld war
 
--
 
Rae Goldf arb:  No,no, Russia invadesPoland.
 
Bill Benson:  No, Septem ber 1, Germ any invadesPolandand Russia comes
 
--
 
Rae Goldf arb:  My part.  I'm only concerned with m y part.
 
(Laughter)
 
Bill Benson: So there's anagreem entbetween Germ any and Russia.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T hat's right.
 
Bill Benson: T wo weeks later the Russians com e in andoccupy yo ur town.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T hey cam e in at night
 
--
 
we ll,  m o s t  of
 
m y m em ory f rom  thosethings are 
m y m other's description ofthings. T he Russians cam e in at night.T he tanks rolled in without 
any notice, no war declaration, no notice. Germ any had declared war on Poland, but our part, 

there was
 
--
 
which was  a long distancef rom  the Germ an/Russian
 
--
 
f rom  the German/Polish 
borderT  Russians just m arched in overnightandtook over half of  Poland.  And that becam e 

an occupationthat lastedfor two years.
 
Bill Benson: So tell uswhat lif e was like under the Soviet occupat
i on,  u nd e r  t he  
Russians during those f irst couple of  years ofthe war.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T he Russian system believedthatany kind
 
--
 
anybody who was 
engaged in comm ercewas not a suitable profession. Everything wa s owned by the state. My 

m other very quickl y dis tributed the contents of the storetof riendly farm ers that shehad 

co n ta ct with
,  
with the agreem ent that they wo uld provide us with som efood inexchangefor 
thefabrics and to use whatever they needed.  She alsohid some ofeven our clothing, her 

co
ats,our better coats, with thef arm ersfor the sim ple reasonbecause the Russians looted.  
T he soldiers would com e in.  Andone of thethings that she always told about and laughed 

about is that shehad som e silk nightgowns and the Russians had conf iscate
d those and 

som e of the wom en were marching around with them  in the street.
 
Also, thatI remem ber is that we hadanalarm clock, which wasn't really small.  It was 
like the sm allbin that is I've seenhere in thiscountry, and a Russian soldier actually st
rapped 
it  o n h is  wris t
 
Bill Benson: Like a watch.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Like awatch.  That was abig possession. It was called " chasy."  W e 
had watches. T hey we re good sized, they we ren't tiny watches, thatm y m other andfather 

wore, but thosethey had hidden
,  of  cour s e .
 
Bill Benson: They had those hidden.  And you were forcedto go toRussian school 
oncethe Russians were in, right?
 
Rae Goldf arb:  I went to a Hebrew parochial school that m yf ather started and I actually 
was enrolled in the school at the age of threebecause they neededa certain amountof  

students.W hen the Russians came inof  course any of  theparochial schools, whether they 

were Christian or Jewi sh were closedand everybody had to attend the public school, which 

was Russian indoctrination.
  
T hat's best way I candescribe it. Andas I told you, Bill,oneof  
theachievementsthat I thought at the tim e was abig one, anybodywho did not belong tothe 

Comm unist Party or had associated with them was not allowed to reach
 
--
 
well, there were 
c e rt
ain requirements in order to get into the lowest branch of the com munisthierarchy and 
that was called the pioneer. And inorder to become a pioneereither your parents had to be 

socialist, com munist, or you had to achieve ahigh grade in your marks in sc
h oo l.   An d  lik ea ll 

5 
 
kids, and I'm  sure I was nodiff erent than a lot of  the kids here in theUnited States that 
wanted to belong to som e sort of a group, Ihad to achieve to getthe red kerchief  with the 

hammer and sickle that held it together. AndI was so proud of it. And of course when I cam e 

home, m y m other said oh, boy.
 
Bill Benson: And what's your f am ily was considered
 
--
 
because they hadbusinesses 
and were considered bourgeois, yourf am ily wasf earful that you would end up getting sent to 

S ib e ria
.  
Rae Goldf arb:  Correct.  Many of  the wealthier people in town, theywould come at 
night, just tell them to take whatever they can with them  in hand, abundle, and they would 

deport them toSiberia.  Actually it would have been a blessing had we beendepo
rt ed .   My 

m other hada backpack
 
--
 
here you would call ate backpack. At that tim e it was a bag with 
things, ready in case they cam e atnight. Because she was a widow I guess she wasn't one 

of  thef irst ones consideredfor the deportation.
 
B ill B e n s on :  A
s you said am om ent ago, you would have wished you had been sent.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W e wished we had
 
--
 
we woul d have hada better chancefor survival, 
the whole fam ily.
 
Bill Benson: Speaking of  that, in June1941,Germ any turned on the Soviets and 
qu ickl y c
onquered all the territory that the Russians had inPoland. T he Germ an Army 

entered your town in the late sum mer of 1941.  By theendof 1941 the Germ ansf orced you 

andthe other Jews into a Dokszyce to a ghetto. Tell us what you recall about that.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W hat Irecall the f irst thing iswe had to wear an insignia.  I'm surem any 
of  you have heard of the yellow star. W e hadto wear it onthe clothing f ront, on the lef tf ront, 

right back, on inner and outer garm ents,needless to say for a kid itwas considereda badge 

of  shame. Also, we were not allowed to
 
--
 
ifanybody walked on the sidewalk, we had to step 
off . And considering that in thepartof  the country that I lived snow started tofall in October 

and stayed on the ground until Easter. Therewas no m odeof  communication.  

Comm unication was by horse and buggy or horseback.  Needless to say the streets weren't 

ver y clean. W hen onewas pushedoff intothe street Ihate to tell you what I cam e hom e 

sm elling like and that was a badge of shame.
  
And of coursef elt much, much depressed. 
Bef ore the winter set in the Jews were all coll ected into a ghetto. T he ghetto was not what 

you considerherea ghetto where ithasa certain segmentof  thepopulation living and called 

a ghetto because it's inhabited by a group associated with eachother sort of .T he ghetto was 

like a prison.  One side of the ghetto, I don't know if  you have thepicture
 
--
 
Bill Benson: W earen't ableto show it here.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Okay. One side of the ghettowas a ri ver.  One sideof  the ghetto was 
the Main Street andactually our housefell into the ghetto because the houses on that street 

all had gates that closed the yards, sortof  blocked offf rom  the street and the restof  it was 

fenced. There were guards around it. People were notallowed to go outand in at leisure.  

T hey were only allo wed out when Germ ans took people to do som e laborfor them or during 

m arket day which thefarm ers could come toa certain gate in the ghettotobarterfood with 

the ghetto inhabitants.
  
Also, thef irstthing that they did isthey had ever yone to come to an 
open area and counted the population.  Everything was accountedfor. T he ghetto, they 

appointed
 
--
 
Jews even during non
-
occupation time, had what theycall the comm ittee council 
that
 
was working with the Jewish population therefor charities,f or people that neededhelp, 
interceding between people and with the government, and they appointed thosepeople to 

intercede with the Nazi governm ent. T hose people were supposedto supply the N
a zis  wit h  

6 
 
f irst they wanted goldand silver. T hey call itfor the benef it of the Germ an arm ies to conquer 
Russia. T hat was the
 
--
 
Bill Benson: That was the line.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T hat was the line.  Needless to say, a lot of  it endedup in their own 
pockets.  Silver, gold, it was like a ransom .  Ever y so often they required a supply of  certain 

things.  Italso came down, not just to gold and silver andm oney, it came down to utensils of  

copper and even iron and that was allfor thewar eff ort.
 
B ill B e
nson: So literally pots and pans.
 
Pots andpans. Potsand pans.  Anything they consider a valueactually.
 
B ill B e n s on :   Righ t .
 
Rae Goldf arb: T he population was used asforced labor. The Germ an Arm y was 
stationed in the barracks where thePolish Arm y hadbefore and the German armies were 

m orem otorized than the Polish arm ies were, so they needed workon cleaning the stables, 

doing their laundry, doing their cooking, whatever m enial jobs they had, and alsof or 

roadwork.  So they would take a num ber of people out in them orning, bring them backat 

night.  Everybody was countedand the populationhad to reportback and the sam enum ber 

th a t th e y lef t. 
 
At one tim eafew younger people hadm anaged to escape and the count was notfull.  
T hey brought the comm ittee out andasked them to present those two people.  Of  course they 

couldn't because they had escaped. T he retribution was tenfor one.  They would not allow 

that comm itteetooff erthem selves as hostages.  Som e of the people, some oldm en cam e 

out and sai
dtheir lif e wasn't worth muchanyway and they're wi lling t o be counted asthe 
hostages.  But that was not acceptable to them . W hat they wanted is for that comm ittee to 

select tenfor each,20 people inall, young men of the sam e age,of the same health, 
t o b e 

presentedto the Nazis. T hat was a very diff icult taskfor them .  How do you give som ebody 

up? They took thosepeople and they shot them  inf ront of the whole populationof  the ghetto.  

T hey just gunned them down.  Needless to say A lot of people c
onsidered escape as a 
sentenceof death to others, so very vie w have tried to escape. Af ew of  them managed to 

escape, though,but not many
 
Bill Benson:  Rae, you said that it wasn't long af ter theGermanoccupation that in your 
words they started diminishing the ghetto.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Yes. W ithin several m onths, under the disguiseof  resettlement,they 
said they were going t o take the Jews toa larger ghetto so that they would have 

consolidation.  Andatfirst they askedeveryb ody to com eto the
 
--
 
to  t h
e area, theopen area 
andthey selectedpeople.  T hey selected a lot of young ones, a lotof  children, and some 

older people, too. Amixture.  T hey did not take them toany larger ghetto. They took them to 

a pitand gunned them down. W ord cam e back about it.  People started to build hiding 

places,planfor hiding places. Sothe second tim earoundthere wer e not somany people 

that came out to thearea when they calledfor resettlem ent, the secondtime, sothey basically 

went house to houseand pulledpeopleout. T hose that had hiding placesof  course hid. Our 

fam ily house and warehouse were L
-
shaped and between the warehouse and the fam ily 
house there was a space between the walls.  From  whatm y m othertoldm e it was usedas 

basically a saf e. W e didn't have iron safes but this was
 
--
 
Bill Benson: A hiding placefor valuables.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  
--
 
a hiding placefor valuables, right.  For any accounting books and so 
forth. Things that they needed in the business.  And it was coveredwith
 
--
 
b y the sam e r
out e ,  

7 
 
so it was a continuation route, itdidn't look like there were two different buildings.  Andthere 
was access toan attic in that area and that became thehiding place.  So when word spread 

and when it was
 
--
 
becam e obvious that they were again looking forpeople supposedly to 
resettle, we went into that hiding place.  Eventually
 
--
 
this tim eof  the year, it was af ter 
Passover that the ghetto was shrunken to such apoint where we knew that was the last thing.  

And Mother tried tof ind places
 
--
 
wa y s  t
o actually get out bef ore, but it was im possible.  
We
 
--
 
thef inal closingof  the ghetto, we clim bed into thathiding place. T here weref ood 
provisions and water provisions there, very litt le sanitationavailable. W e clim bed into that 

placeand we were hiding there.
 
Bill Benson: And who was with you?  Tell uswho was with you in that hiding place.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  My m other took of course meandm y brother in. I know m y 
grandm other was there, and there were some other people.  I don'trem em ber who.
 
B ill B
enson: But yourgrandm other was with you.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  My gra ndmother was with us andbasically saved us eventually.  But we 
hid in that place.  From what m y m other toldm e, we were there between eight and ten days.  

Conditions became horrible and we ha
d  to
 
--
 
som e of the people couldn't stand it anym ore.  If  
you are enclosed with no light, theonly thing you could hear was what was going on outside 

because thehouses were not built of
 
--
 
not too many with m uch brick.  It was mostly wood.  
So sound penetrated. You couldn't even speak loud.  Youhad to speak in whispers. Some of  

thepeople just couldn't stand it anym ore andcam e
 
--
 
went out. T hey were caught but they 
never disclosed who else was hiding.  Attheend,f rom  what m y mother told us, well, I 
k now 

m y m other,m y brother, and Iand m y grandmother were there, there were several other 

people. W eclim bedout.  My m other wasf irst and of course had tohelp us down.  Me and m y 

brotherand m y grandmother and some of the other people, there were a couple of children, I 

know that,that cam eout with us, we thought that it was all quietfor a certainamount of time 

butobviously there were some looters thatthought they m ightf ind som ething. And all of a 

sudden we heard voices.  It was nighttim e. W ehid
 
--
 
there was anotherplace in apantry that 
was a root cellar that was ahiding place.  Mother took us quickly to that root cellar.  

Grandm other was behind us so she coveredus with a cover and she acted crazy. W hen she 

was asked was anyone elsehere she
 
said Idon't know anything.  Iwas laying there, I was 
half  out,and Idon't know m uch. And she acted crazy.  T hey took her away.  M y m other 

heardher be taken away.  
 
W estayed until the next night and we ventured out. Motherf igured thebest way to 
cr
oss was across the river.  I rem em ber the nam e of the river, it was  theBerezina,and it 
sta rte d
 
--
 
it was still pretty narrow at our place and not toodeep,and we waded the river and 
were m et by two guards.  Mother knew them ,they knew m y m other. Everybody in town knew 

m y m other. She had told them toput their rif les on their back.T hey knew that shehad 

valuables.  She said she'll give them  whatever shehas to let us run.  Little did shef igurethat 

eventually they would tell onus anyway.  She had a watch with a gold chain that she put into 

thehands of one of them  and kind of wrapped it aroundhis wrist so he wouldn't lose it. And 

she gave some trinkets to theother guard. She told him  to put outhis hands so she canput 

the trinkets in.  By the tim e it tookthem todisposeof  those trinkets to put them away in the 

pockets, we were ableto run.
 
W eran to a village wh ere we usedto goat Christm astim e tohelp decorate the 
Christm as tree.  Myf ather's bestf riend.  He agreed tohidem y brother and su
ggested that his 

sister, who had adaughter m y age, that shewould be able to hidem e.  My mother lef tm y 

8 
 
brother with him  and we went tohis sister's house.  Shefedus, of course, and we got to clean 
up a little bit, and word came to herthat they were beating up herbrother.  His mother
-
in
-
l a w 
told on him  because she would get ten kilo sugar for disposing
 
--
 
exposing a Jew.  So she 
was wil ling to risk that. They beat up her son
-
in
-
law until hef inally told them  wherem y 
brother was hidden.  However, he hadenough sense to send hisown son tohis sister's house 

just totell her that theGerm ans were trying t o take m y brother away and they were beating up 

on hisfather.  Needless to say, his sister packed us up very quickl y and sent usoff . 
 
She sentus to
 
hide ina bathhouse. T here was a stone bathhouseat the endof  the 
vil lage.  T he villagers did not, needless to say, have showers and bathtubs or 

bathroom s
 
--
 
one ormore bathroom s in the house, and so they
 
--
 
on Saturday they went to 
clean up for church
 
and they would go to thebathhouse to take their baths. And we hid there 
overnight.  And then we ventured off. 
 
T he next place we basically ever ything on foot.  By night we walked, during theday we 
hid.  And we got to the house of the wom an that took care of m y brother.  She hidus and she 

went off  to town tof ind out wherem y brother was.  Unfortunately had we gone theref irst,I 

don't know, maybe m y brother wouldhave been alive because shewanted to see if  she could 

get m y brother.  Shehad no children and she would have raised him as her own.  However,  

shefound out that hewas shot.  And that was May 8, 1942. 
 
Bill Benson: And he was six or seven years of age?
 
Rae Goldf arb:  No,hewas f our years of age.
 
Bill Benson:  Four years of  age.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Four years of  age.  No,I'm  sorry, he was
 
--
 
B ill B e n s on :   He wa s  s ix.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  He was six or seven years of age.  He wasf our when the picture was 
taken.
 
B ill B e n s on :   Righ t .
 
Rae Goldf arb:  By thewa y, that picture you saw f irst, that's theonly 
possession I have 
andthe only m em ory Ihave of m y brother. The only possession I have f rom
 
--
 
f rom my 
home.
 
Bill Benson: Soonceyour m om got this
 
--
 
your m om  gotthis horrible news, what did 
you do then?
 
Rae Goldf arb: W ell, my m otherdecided thatthe safestplace was toget to the larger 
ghetto. And so we went againtoaf arm er. W ehad many farmerf riends,but everybody was 

af raid. They were af raid because anybody could exposethem and thatm eant deathto their 

fam ilies. And to us, of course. This
 
particular wom an was a widow whose husband had died 
af ew years back andm y f atherbasically helpedher save thefarm .  He extendedf unds to her 

so she could continueon and shehid us overnight. T he next day was marketday, and the 

farm ers would taketh
ei r  
--
 
whatever producethey had to sell tothem arket.  She loaded the 
wagon with the produce and instead of herself and her sonand daughter going to the 

m arketplace, she dressedm e in herdaughter's clothes,m y m otherin her clothes, and theson 

drove the wagon andwe went to this larger city where there was aghetto still with Jews.
 
W ith the crowds we managedto steal into the ghetto and of coursethe son sold his 
produce and wentback hom e.  Inthe ghetto it was the sam e arrangem entand you had
 
--
 
in  
t
his larger ghetto youhad to have docum ents.  Because you could not evenmove around in 
the ghetto without docum ents. My m other was able to obtaindocum entsf orme andm yself.  

T hat's when I becameborn in1930,even though I was two years younger.  It al
s o  qu a l if i ed 

9 
 
me
 
--
 
Bill Benson: W as that just accidentalor was thata deliberate decision?
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Idon't really know.  T hat's thedocum ent she was able toobtain.
 
Bill Benson: Okay.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  And it's of  little consequence to me other than
 
the fact th at I wa s a b le  to 
go out with the workf orce.
 
Bill Benson: Becauseyou were t wo years older.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Because I was oldenough todo som e work.  All I can tell you is that if 
you couldn't get out to work, the next time they cam e to shrink the ghetto, you were one ofthe 
selected people.  My work was
 
--
 
and that I rem em ber
 
--
 
t yi n g
 
--
 
in aspinning wheel, tying the 
wool threads that hadbroken.  Ihad tobe very quick andfortunately I had nimblef ingers. My 

m other was taken outas a laundress.  So we had the ability to leave the ghetto with the 

workf orce. W ithm y mother's contacts during m arket days, she was able to connect with a 

f riend ofm y f ather's who sm uggled a gun into abasket of eggs tom y m other.  Supposedly he 

was selling her the eggs.  And she had something to offer. She knew there were Russian 

prisoners of war thatmanagedtoescape theGerm ans who m istreated them  badly and 

form ed them selves into a resistance to slow the progress of the Nazis to the f ront lines.  And 

so she had som ethingto offer.  And one day, with the workf orce going out to the assignment, 

we walked out with the farmers
 
--
 
Bill Benson: To go toyour jobs.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W e walked out to go to the jobs, but we walked out of the city with the 
farm ers returning. Som eof  them  would come by wagon and someof  them would bring 

produce onf oot.T he onesthat the village was closer would bring produce on foot. So this is 

how we got out of the ghetto.
 
Bill Benson: So you're outtohave ghetto.  Your mother has taken you to sneak into 
the ghettoand now you've gotten outof  it.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W e snuck out. W e hadthe clothing, thef arm ers' clothing that we could 
blend intothef arm  population and could walk out.
 
Bill Benson:  Yourm om 's objective now was to link up with those partisans.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T he partisans. She actually had plans bef ore, they built a tunnel under 
thebarbed wire f encing.  Somebody got wor d of  it, som e young m an, and they used the 

tunnel beforethe time andthey were caughtby the Germ ans.  Andso that route was closed 

to us.
 
Bill Benson: Sof rom there, Rae, yourm other and youm ake your way into the 
partisans in theforest.  And so ina
 
--
 
give us a sense of what that was like.  It's hard to 
im agine.  Here's your m other,escapedoutof the ghetto with a young child going into the 

woods,f inding a group of resistancef ighters,thepartisans, and joining up with them . First, 

how did sheeven getwelcomed into the resistance?
 
Rae Goldf arb: W ell, that was her idea. She had the gun. T he Russian prisoners of 
war were m arched
 
--
 
that's what she toldm e, to the town and evenwhen some of the 
non
-Je wish  
--
 
well, the Jewish population couldn't butthenon
-
Jewis h population wouldoffer 
them  water, they woul d hit them  with the rif le butts and would n
o t let th em a cce pt the  wa ter.  
T hey got so disgustedof  course and saw that there was no
 
--
 
no avenue of  escape f or them.  
T hey started to escape en m asse.  Som e of  them were shot and som e of  them , of  course, got 

away.  T he area is surroundedby forests,pinef orests.  Any of  you have gone to cut your own 

Christm as trees? Youhave seen how low the pine
 
--
 
thepinebranches are?  W ell, that's how 

10
 
 
we could hide.  I sleptm any anight under those pine branches andhopef ully not a cone 
under m y back. T heyescaped en masse and gathered in the f orest.  They had no guns to 

protectthem selves or to do any harm  to the progress of the Germ ans to thef ront lines. At 

f irst they laid down their rif les andbecame prisoners of war and then we had tof ight their way 

to  r
em ainalive.  And so they would try to catch som e soldiers who were out on assignments.  
Howe ver, they did notshoot them , because then, you know, they would
 
--
 
they will get a force 
com ing tof ight them.  So what they did was, is they would takeaway their rif les, takeaway 

their clothing.  Inthe first place they had some Nazi unif orm s, the German unif orm s so they 

coulddisguise them selves to dotheir work, and they would leave them  in their underwear and 

t e ll t h em
 
--
 
tell them  that thefarm er caught you with his daughter so he made you run so they 
could save face. T hey had the rif les and they had som e German clothing so they could 

inf iltrate andthey could also startf ighting back.  Mostof  the work of  the partisans was to 

disrupt the progress to the f ro
nt lines, the Germ an progress to thef ront lines, tof ight the 
Ru ssia n s.  
T he work was to dislodge
 
--
 
excuse m e.T hework was to dislodge the railroad ties so 
the trains would derail.  Needless to say, they could collect some amm unitionf rom the trains 

an
dusethat am munition to blow up some ofthe roads.T hey weren't
 
--
 
they were m ostly 
cobblestone roads. There were some roads that were pavedas theGerm ans progressed and 

they used the labor of  the population.  So thiswa y they
 
--
 
they could slow the
 
--
 
the lines to 
the f ront
 
Bill Benson: So Rae, tell us what your m other and you were doing with the partisans.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W ell, basically Mother was cooking the soup.  Mostly potato soup.
 
Bill Benson: She was their cook.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  She was their cook.  Motherdidn't cook at home.
 
( Laughter ) 
 
But she learned.  Shewas a good observer, and she knew if  youf ried onions that they 
m ake the soupa little better.  And so they loved the soup.  Also, thefarmers had to give the 

Germ ans a certain amount of their produce and som etim es they wo uld com eand take their 

cattle,their cows, and of course their horseswere all taken. And they would
 
--
 
the farmers 
f inally drove the livestock into theforest
 
--
 
further into thef orestfor grazing and thepartisans 
we
re the guards. So
 
--
 
and the Germ ans were af raid to go intotheforest because they wo uld 
encounter the resistance. 
 
As thef ront lines started tom oveforward, theRussian arm ies kind of joined up with 
som e of the partisans.  They didn't really join them
 
but what they didwas is they supplied 
them  with amm unition, basically grenades becausethat would blow up railroad cars and 

som e am munitionfor the guns. T hey woulddrop itand the partisans really organi zed 

them selves as an Army.  And the Russians dropped som epeopleof rank that couldmanage 

them . They also set up a hospital, and I wound up inone of them because I got sick with 

t yp h
us.  Motherm anaged to get m e to thathospital because we wer e with af orward group.  
You would call it a reconnaissance
 
group, at the edge of the forest.  And we wound up not 
with our group but all the way in the back of theforest inthe hospital.  By the tim ethe Russian 

arm ies were pushing the Germ ans out,theyhadaf ront line to
 
--
 
to consider and then the 
back line. 
 
T he partisans were kind of surrounding them , so they started tof ight the partisans.  
And thepartisans dispersed.  Mother and I,of  course, were stuck inthe hospital.  I was wel l 

enough to walk, however, I
 
--
 
m y head was bald.  It was shaved.  My hair
 w
as shaved 
because the
 
--
 
t yp h
uswas spread by lice and of course everybody tried not to have any hair.  

11
 
 
T hat's where they hid the m ost
 
Bill Benson:  You mentioned a little while agothat you sleptm any nights under pine 
needle branches in the pine forest.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Oh, yes.
 
Bill Benson: But really the conditions were really tough.  You were living in the woods, 
food was m eager, theweather was awf ul attim es, it was a really ver y harsh environm entfor 
you.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  It
 
--
 
it was a very harsh envi
ronm ent.  But the farm ers
 
--
 
the farm ers 
were m ostly
 
--
 
they were cognizant of  thefact that the partisans were there and to som e 
degree the partisansdid not loot them. T he partisans did not takeawa y their grain that was 

next year's crop basically.  T hey could
 
--
 
they could sow their grain, their seed. And their 
animals were kind of preserved.  Sothey wer e will ing to supply some of the things to the 

partisans, basically f oodstuff s.  Butat tim es when
 
--
 
when the Germans cam e into the villages 
and since
 
we were af or ward group, we were m oreexposedto them , we had to hide and then 
we would run into theforest. 
 
Food was scarce.  Potatoes
 
--
 
Belarus is known f or its potatoes sopotatoes were 
pretty plentiful and also root vegetables. And of  coursethere were m ushroom s in theforest.  I 

knew which m ushrooms to eatand which notto. And there were cranberries because there 

were m arches
 
Bill Benson: Lived offthe land,to some extent.  In the tim e we haveleft, Ithere are 
som e things you want to tell us. 
 
You were caught by the Russianswith the partisans and 
then had a very narro w escape. Tell us about that.
 
Rae Goldf arb: W hen the partisansdispersed and we were with no group, basically we 
were caught up with the f arm ers, with the population.  And thep
opulation was taken out of  the 

vil lages and brought
 
--
 
well, the closestplacewas our hometown and they put us in a 
warehouse. W e werecaught with the population. Atonepoint they startedthe
 
--
 
Nazis were 
famous for separating fem ales f rom  m ales, even
 
children.  Female children from m ale 
children. And there were no young
 
--
 
not toom any young m en because the youngm en were 
af raid. Either they wer e taken into theGerman arm ies or they basically had to join with the 

partisans.  So they started to separ
ate the fem ales f rom the m ales, and I had no hair and I 
was dressed like a boy and I was being separatedf rom  m y mother. I was sent with the boys. 
 
Since I knew Yiddish which is a very sim ilar language toGerman,they were debating 
whether I was a girl or
 
a boy because thef eatures lookedm ore likea girl but the dressand no 
hair prom pted them  tothink I was aboy.  And I saidthe only word that would getm eback to 

m y m other which was " mechen"  whichm eant girl.  And they
 
--
 
som e of  them  decided Im ay be 
Jewish because how would I know the word, the Germ an word.  Most of  thefarmers were 

ver y ill iterate anddid not pickup languages. Mother got word of  it, because she was hiding.  

She was in her hometown with the populationthat knew her very well , and she cam eout and 

approached the Germans and said thatI was her daughter. T hey had gallows set up. T hey 

were f am ousf orhanging people. They putme under the
 
ga llo ws  
and they said toher, we 
won't touch you, but tell us is thisa Jewish child?  Andm y m other said no, she is m y 

daughter.  She is not Jewish.  She knew af ew words of  GermanbecauseI was doing your 

laundry.  And Iam slow, I can't understand, I can't learna language, but she'sa child andshe 

learned afew words.  And they decided if m y m otheroff ered herself to be hung f irst and they 

did not recognize heras Jewish then she'sprobably telling the truth.  And they let us go. 
 
Bill Benson: So then you rejoinedthe partisans af ter that.
 

12
 
 
Rae Goldf arb: W ell, whathappened was they sent the villagers back to their villages 
and we had no village to go to.  Mother gave them the name of a village.  She knew the area 
ver y well, of a way distant village so that we kind of had to pass andstop atm any villages, 

different villages. W efinally cam e to a
 
place where som e of  the villagers couldn't go any 
furtherbecauseof  the f ront lines and som ebody recognized m y m other.  However, there was 

another wom an thatheard about it and shedid not have any ill f eelings towards Jews and she 

knew m y m otherf or the
 
type of person that she was and she cam eover to herand she says 
look, I recognized you a long time agobut I kept quiet.  But there'sa murm urthat som ebody 

said they think they recognized you and they know that you're Dina,thefabric store owner. 

So  
I would suggest that you m ake yourself  scarce.  Mother tookm eand we ranagain. And at 
thatpoint we were able to f ind some of the partisans. W e ranbasically toward thef ront lines 

because we knew thatthat's m y m other,I didn't know anything, m ym other knew that that's 

where probably the partisans would go and that's to help the Russian armies.  And so we did 

get with the partisansand we were liberatedby the Russians.
 
Bill Benson: And tell us about your liberation.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Oh, after
 
--
 
we ll,  
when we wer e liberated, we went to live in the bigger 
city where we were in the second ghetto because we heard that some of the Jews m anaged 

to escape that ghetto and gatheredthere.  Mother went to ourhom etown to see who survi ved.  

You go to theplace where you com ef rom, if  you're looking for som eone.  Aneighbor gave 

her the photograph that you saw on the screen.  Shepicked it upf rom  the garbage.  She told 

m y m other she did notloot her house.  She invited her toherhouseand said look at m y 

house, I
 
have nothingfrom  your house.  Youwere a good neighboranda goodf riend.  I 
pickedup thepictureas a mem entoof  you. But I would suggest that you don't spend the 

night becauseI would love to have you as m y guest but both you and I would not survi ve 
the 

night.  She gave m y mother some breadandfood and of course thephotograph,and mother 

cam e back tothe bigger ghetto, basically again, walking with 30 kilom eters. It wasn't aneasy 

wa l k .
 
Bill Benson:  Rae, I think we have tim e toturn toour audienc
e to ask some questions.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Okay.
 
Bill Benson: Butbefore we do, I would like you to, if  you would,talk about yourm other 
was just an extraordinary wom an inevery wa y.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Motherwas
 
--
 
she was sm art,needless to say, but she was a
l s o  ve r y 
resourceful and she could look ahead and see what todonext.  She always planned,and I 

guess it was easy f orher to planahead.  Idon't know.  I guess all of us plan ahead. 
 
Bill Benson: Tell us abouther
 
--
 
at theend ofthe water, you were liberated in the 
summ er of '44 but thewar went on,of  course, until May of  '45.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Correct.
 
Bill Benson:  Yourm other was able to get you on a trainf ixing water towers.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Motherenlisted.  Asa partisan
 
--
 
Bill Benson: She enlist
ed in the Russian Army.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  She enlisted inthe RussianArm y as a worker and we
 
--
 
we got lodging 
in a boxcar andtraveled with the train tof ix water towers. W e gotas far as Prussia where 

conditions were awf ul and shem anaged to get our train car attached toa train that was 

heading south to a city calledLublin where there was
 
--
 
it
 
was a big city and it was ver y close 
to oneof  the concentration cam ps, and that'swhere the survivors ga thered. We got
 
--
 
I ' ll 
m ake it short now. W e got to that city and they had already som eestablishment with the 

13
 
 
Jews in Palestine where they sent groupsto try to bring the Jews out of  Poland into what was 
then calledPalestine and now is Israel.  Andwe basically
 
--
 
I learned m y geography on foot.  
W e walked, rode, until we got to Italy. W e were caughtat onepointwe thought we were in 

the Russian
 -- 
the Am erican zone, we endedup inthe British zone,they sentus back to the 
Russian zoneand eventually went through the alppasses, the Alpian passes into Italy.  T he 

f irst city we went into was Padua, then Modena, and then we endedup inSanta Cesarea
. 
Bill Benson: The very endof  theboot of Italy.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T he very end of the bootof  Italy with the hope of  crossing the 
Mediterranean into what was then Palestine,being Israel. However,  I'm sure all of you have 

heard, orm aybe theadults have heard about theexodus,the shipthat was caught and the 

people takenoff at Cyprus and becam e kindof  imprisoned there.W emissed that ship by this 

m uch.  Mother startedto lookf orm y aunt and uncle who imm igrated to the United States and 

she had m em oriz
ed the address. Theonly thing shef orgot was thetwo letters af ter 
W ashington. She wrote the letters toW ashington but it went toW ashington State.
 
(Laughter)
 
T he letters cam eback, and of  course it had to beW ashington, DC but she put an ad in 
a  Je wish
 
newspaper andm y uncle saw it and contacted us, went and made out
 
--
 
f or m aking 
out im m igration papers.  He hadtoprom ise to support us, provide lodging, f ood, clothing, 

m edical, andeducation form eand deposit$5,000 in1947, which was afortune.  He 

m
ortgaged his store
 
--
 
he hada grocery store
 
--
 
in order to supply the guaranteefor usto 
com e tothe United States.
 
Bill Benson:  Rae, we're going to turn to ouraudience, but ism y m em ory correct that 
yo u
 
--
 
you couldn't getover here because the
 
--
 
th e
 
Polish quotaf orcom ing here was so
 
--
 so  
restrictive so you were able to endup getting on a Russian quota which allowed you to get 

here. And the other thing I want to say is thatbecause your identif ication papershad you two 

years and you really were,
 
when you cam e here, you were
 
--
 
you were off icially 17 on record, 
you were reall y only 15, but you were 17 but they put youhere in school in kindergarten or 

f i r s t  gr a d e.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Elem entary school.
 
Bill Benson: Elementary school at age17but you quickl y m ade your wa y up.  So let's 
turn to ouraudience.  And we will hear again f rom  Rae to close ourprogram . But we do have 

a couplem inutesfor som e questions.  I'm  going to ask you tom ake your question as brief as 

you can. W e'll have mics in the aisle. Please wait until you have am icrophone in your hand 

to askthe question.  Keep it brief . I will repeat the question to be sure that everybody, 

including Rae,hears the question and then she'll respond to it. And I'm  going to turnf irst, ifI 

can,
 
to Kai here because she's getting questions on the Internetf rom  people who are tweeting 
andonthe Internet.  Kai, you have a question.
 
>> Yes, good m orning, Rae.  The question we have via T witter is while volunteering at 
them useum  and sharing your story, can you tell us about your most m em orable visitor that 

you've m et?
 
Bill Benson: Tell about them ostm em orable visitor that youhave met hereatthe 
m useum .  Yourm ostm em orable visitor.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Mostmem orable visitor.  My m ostmemorable visitor here at the 
m useum  was actually som ebody who was f rom  Belarus. I was surprised because we have 

m any visitors f rom m any countries,South Am erican countries,even asfar asAustralia, New 

Zealand,f rom Af rica, and here som ebody shows up f rom  Belarus.  And he says how did you 

14
 
 
survi ve? 
 
( Laughter ) 
 
I said well, there was som e goodones.
 
B ill B e n s on :   Uh
-
huh. W ashe living here orwas she actually a visit or
 
--
 
Rae Goldf arb:  No,hewas li vin g here.  He escaped too.
 
Bill Benson:  He escaped too. Okay.  All right.  Do we have anybody who has a 
question,and I'll try tospot you,but I'll ask the ushers tohelp me do that.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  Actually there was onem ore that I wantedtom ention.
 
Bill Benson: Okay.
 
Rae Goldf arb: T herewas a
 
gentleman 
--
 
t hat  wa s  a  
while back 
--
 
f rom  Cambodia that 
was ver y m uch surprise that hadhe saw theexhibit on Cam bodiaat the Holocaust Museum .  
Andof  course I told him  that we're concerned with all theatrocitiesthat happen anywhere, this 

m u s eum ,  s u r e,  i s
 
--
 
com memorates the Holocaust becausethat was them ost horrible, the 
biggest exterm ination of peoplef ornoother reason but because the Nazis instilled so much 

hate into the public against the Jews and against other segmentsof thepopulation that with 

their lives we were able to inf lict som uch unnecessary painand destruction of  hum an life.  

Andhe was im pressed with thef act that Cambodia, which had am uch smaller atrocity, was 

comm em orated here.  Not only that, he took out his wallet, he becam e a m em ber of  the 

m u s eum ,  an
d gave $100
 
--
 
B ill B e n s on :   No k id d ing.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  
--
 
donation.  He saidI'm  sorry, I don't have any m ore right now to spare.  
And I thought, you know, for am om ent there, If orgotabout it.
 
Bill Benson: Thank you f or sharing that one.W ehave a question right here.
 
Audience Mem ber:  Hi.  Hi, Rae.T hank you. So impressed with your lifeand the 
strength of your
 
--
 
your  story and that of  yourm om .  How
 
--
 
when you cam eback over here, 
how long did your m other survive?
 
Bill Benson: Tell us how long your m om  survived is the question.
 
Rae Goldf arb:  My m om  lived to the ripe oldage of 991/2.
 
(Applause) 
 
Shediedof am assive stroke. And am azingl y enough she died on the sam eEnglish 
date asm y brother was shot.  It was
 
--
 
it was am azing that she survived.  Thedoctors couldn't 
understand how she was holding on. And yet, onthe morning, 8:00 in the morning, on the

I think that'sprobably it.  I'm  going toturn to Rae for her closing words. 
 
Rae Goldf arb: T he only thing is that over theyears when Ihave spoken about the 
Holocaust and kind of  looked back at it, it was lies about segm ents of the population that 

instilled hate in others. I couldn't im agine why I was hated because I was Jewish. W e lived a 

quiet life observing the rules of the country, didn't do anybody any harm,and created so much 

hate againstus. I was m any times askedby studentsand by adults,don't you still hate the 

Na zis ?  
 
I hate their idea of  what they didtous, of  what they instilled in people.  Alm ost11 
m illion people lost their lives.  About 6
 
m illionof  them were Jews.  For noapparent reason, 
because hate was instilled against them . 
 
Bill Benson: Thank you, Rae.
