A: It was a small town, and we had a lot 
of ammunition factory, steel mills, copper

[indecipherable]
 the people would buy wood, and a lot 
of people had businesses. Most of the Jewish
 people were in business, some -- one 
owned th-the lumberyard. And we were in  the tailoring business. My father was a 

skilled tailor, my brothers were tailors and 
some of the sisters were helping along 
sewing, too. I was too young to
 do anything but go to  school. 
Q: Was there a large Jewish  population in your town? 

A: I would say maybe about 5,000 people, I 
would think, in that
 area, with all the 
little surrounding, little 
shtetls
. Approximately that™s what I would think it would 
be.

Q: Did your fami ly have a 
long history in that area? 
A: I really don™t remember. I do remember 
way back to  my  grandfather, that™s the 
only one I -- that I remember, and anythi
ng be-before that, I am not aware of. 
Q: You said that you were t
oo young to do too mu ch  tailo
ring. What kinds of chores 
did you have around th
e house? What were your responsibilities? 
A: Well, ma -- my responsib
ility was to make the iron so 
they can press. In those 
days you had the iron and it was hollo w insi
de, and th ey  would put some kind of a 
coal it looked like and you wo
uld have to lay it on the floor and blow at it to get it 
started. And I would start the iron for them
. And just help cleaning up a little bit, th-
the scrap stuff that they were cutting aw ay
, that™s about it. Then  go to school. 
Q: What language or language
s were spoken in your home? 
A: Mostly Yiddish. Mostly 
Yiddish. But we were also
 speaking a little bit Polish 
too, not that much. 
Q: What religious traditions
 did your family observe? 
A: We were reli -- pretty religious. My father was a 
gabbai
 in the 
shul
 and I 
reme mb er going tw ice a day to synagogue
, mo rning and the evenin g. And -- and 
with my father, before the school started,
 early in the morning 
we™d go fo r prayers, 
and of course in th
e -- in the evenings 
[indecipherable]
 we used to go. And 
Shabbas
, ev ery holiday  we would ob-observe. I 
mean s -- the dietary laws were

strictly -- I mean, enforced
 in our house. And if you 
had red handles and blue 
handles, everything meant differently. 
One was for dairy and one for -- was the 
meat. And we also had dishes for Passover 
separately. So we were pretty religious 
at home.  

Q: Did you have a favorite holiday ?  

A: My favorite holiday was Passover. That 
was our favorite holiday. The reason, we 
used to get all new clothes, new shoes, 
new -- new shirts, we™d always dress up for 
that holiday. And there were 
lots of goodies to eat, be
sides the matzoh. My  mo th er 
was pretty good then at ba
king all kinds of goodies. 
Q: Did you go to a public sc
hool, or a religious school? 
A: I went to both. I went to public school 
and also the religious school, too. In the 
Polish -- in the regular school we used to
, you know, go t -- go like t -- you go here, 
like, you know, to learn the language and the history of 
Poland
, I guess. And then 
when  we co me home, we would go to Hebr
ew  school every day, in  the afternoon. 

The Hebrew school was small, it was a 
shtibl
 like what they used to call, and the 
rebbe 
was there and he was teaching us Hebrew
. And then we™d finish, went home 
and eat -- and eat and do your
 homework and that™s it. 
Q: Did you have an
y favorite subjects?

A: Not re -- I used to like -- the Hebrew wa
s my really -- I used to love that, I 
learned and -- and -- believe it or not, that
 I don™t know too mu ch now, I have 
forgotten most of it, all of my Hebrew. 
And I forgot Polish too, I didn™t -- you 
know, I was too young, and I didn™t learn -- 
up to about seventh grade, what could I 
learn up -- by seventh grade? No t too mu ch . 
Q: When you were little, what did you 
think you would be 
when you grew up? 
A: Well, believe it or not, in my house th
ey  were always teasing me what I™m going 
to be, and I used to tell 
them I™m going to be a 
rebbe [indecipherable]. 
Somehow, 
I don™t know wh at that got into  
me and I would tell them I™ll be a 
rebbe
 and a 
[indecipherable]
. I used to like the 
rebbe
 and th  -- and they used  to come dressed 
with their 
pa yo s
, you know. On 
Shabba s
 they  would dress real nice and I used  to 
say that™s what I wanted to be
. But that never materialized.  
Q: When  you weren™t in school
, what did you do for fun? 
A: For fun we used to play 
soccer, mostly, then like kids, 
played around, all kind of 
games, you know, Hide and Seek , yo
u know, all kind of game, like -- like 

everywhere else, children do. We have 
our own games to play with. Ride the 
bicycles, that kind of thing. 
Q: What were relations lik
e between the Jews and the 
non-Jews in your town?

A: Before the war we were pretty mu
ch getting along with the non-Jewish 
population in our own city. I 
can only speak for my city. Th
ey were pretty nice, we 
used to do mo st of the tailoring for the no
n-Jewish -- also the Jewish too, but 90 
percent we did fo r non-Jews. 
They come in, pick materi
al, my  father would make 
them a suit, or they would make a pair of
 slacks out, whatever. And we got along 
pretty good. In school we used to have 
our little fights here and there. They didn™t 
like our curls around our -- our ears, our 
payos 
we used to wear 
around and they -- 
sometimes we™d have the boys come up an
d try to pull on them, you know, just 
teasing you. And we were fighting back, we
 -- we weren™t afraid of them in school, 
just like kids here. We have our skirmishes
 and then we forgiv
e each other and we 
play again. 
Q: Did you experience any 
anti-Semitism as a child? 
A: Not -- there was alw ays something a little bit, but I was too young to even realize 

what that even -- what that
 word meant even, anti-Semiti
sm. I didn™t realizes th is til 
later on in life. 

Q: What did you know about 
Hitler
 and wh at was happening in 
Germ any
 before 
the war?

A: I myself did not fi -- hear anything. If my
 parents did they never told me about it. 
I -- I was not aware of it. I don™t even know
 who he was or even
 he existed until 
later on. 
Q: Had you heard about 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: Ef -- during when I got -- during the wa
r I heard about it, af-after I -- when the 
Germans invaded our city th
en we -- then the news ca
me around to  -- then it was 
mo re open, people were talking about it.  

Q: Before the invasion, had any German
 refugees come th
rough your town? 
A: We had German Jews who would come in
, yes. But then again, I was too young 
to pay attention to all of that. I wasn™t 
paying -- I rememb er the-they would always 
sometimes complain that the 
people who put them up didn™t take good care of them 
as much, but we just had little. So whatev er little we had we were willing to share 
with them. But they 
thought maybe we didn™t share enough, I don™t know. I was in -
- that™s what I heard.  
Q: Did you get a sense from -- you know, 
when you were a child, did you get a 
sense from the adults that
 they were concerned or alarmed by even ts in 
Germany
? 
A: Not really, because ev
erybody was doing their daily -- going a
nd doing their 
work  and going to the synag
ogue to prayers, and going to
 do their regular things 
that one does during the wh
ole day of going th rough. Bu
t I didn™t ever see anybody

be talking about that, or -- or you know, about -- about the -- 
Germany
 and all this 
business. I didn™t hear it, I was too young, I guess.  
Q: Did your parents ever 
talk about possibly leaving 
Poland
? 
A: Well, we were talking about leaving. 
My oldest brother, he always had th at -- 

wanted to  leave. But -- my  father had two brothers in 
America
 and also a siste r in 
America
. And my  oldest brother, he was the 
main correspondent, he was writing in 
Hebrew, and he would write to them all the ti
me to see the situations here that -- not 
so good. We™re not that wealthy here, we wa
nt to come to the land of honey, so to 
speak, and he kept writing to th em, writing 
with -- to them all these years, an d 
finally in 1937 they  decided 
that, for one child 
only. And so we picked one -- one of 
the girls to go to  
United States
. And sh e did immigrate to 
United Sta tes
 in 1937. 
And the rest of them, then th
e war broke out there again a
nd so it was too late to do 
anything then. 

Q: Which sister?  
A: Ma -- 
Diana
. I don™t know what -- what down th
e line she is, the fourth or the 
fifth, I™m n o t sure. But 
she was, in 1937 in 
Wa shington, D.C.
. 
Q: What was happening in  your life right be
fore the war? When 
you think back on 
the days right before the war, wh
at was happening in your life?

A: Well, right before the war, my father 
died. That was a tragedy right there. Two 
months -- I think it was two months before the war, and I was only 12 at the time. 
And I reme mb er going into the synagogue 
and talking to the man -- one of my  
brothers was in the Polish army , and th e other, the oldest brother, he was around 

with us, he was not married yet, and I re
member going with him to the synagogue. 
And the -- the caretaker in 
the synagogue told me th
at I should start laying 
Tefillin
, 
at my  age, you know, I was with 
[indecipherable]
 because your father died, I don™t 
reme mb er what it was, what reason, but he
 told me I should wear those -- start to 
wear it. And they gave me a 
Tefillin
 
[indecipherable]
 and I started wearing with 
the 
tallit.
 And that was -- I mean, I lost my fa
ther, I mean, you know, and the way I 
lost him is I came home one Satu rday, and of
 course, children is children, you were 
religious, but you still liked 
to play a little ballgame on th
e Sabbath. So we snuck 
away to go play ball. When  
I came home, my  father was in bed, and I was only with 
my  father and my  mo th er was home. And he
 told me as -- as he was laying in bed 
that I should close the curtain on it because the sun was coming in  on his -- where 

he was resting. So I closed it up, and as I 
closed it up I turned to lo ok at him, blood 
rushed out of his mouth and he told  me to
 go get mo ther. So I ran in the next room, 
I got the mo ther and she came and she says, run fo r the docto r. So fo r me, 12 years 

you know, running was pretty good, I coul
d run fast. And it was only about fo ur or

five blocks away. And I went to the doctor 
and the doctor came 
back on the bicycle 
and I was chasing him on foot. And by th
e time we came he was already dead . And 
right after that, I mean, you know, things
 changed a little bit. But I had my older 
brother which wasn™t, you kn
ow, too bad, I mean he ke
pt the business going, sort 
of. And -- 
Q: Which brother was that? 

A: 
David
. He was the oldest. I think one of the gi
rls were older than him, I think, at 
least two or one, of which I don™t know wh
ich one was first. And -- and then what -- 
w-we stayed there and you kn
ow, things were sort of -- 
we were lonesome at the 
house, it wasn™t the same like it was. You 
know, you lose a parent how it is, at the 
age of 12, you miss them.  
Q: I™d like you to take a mo ment to give
 me a physical description of what you 

looked like at age 12, in
cluding how tall you were. 
A: Well, I hi -- I remember how tall I was,
 I was -- for my age I was pretty tall, 
which helped me during th e war. And 
then I was ab -- I was -- did wear 
payos
 
believe it or not, I have the 
payos
 and 
tzitzit,
 I have the whole thing, I was like a -- 
like a Jewish boy wearing i -- in a kosher home. And I looked pretty goo -- I 

thought I looked good, I was healthy, a
nd th at™s probably what saved my  life.

Q: Is there anything else that stan ds 
out in your mind about your life before the 
war? 

A: Well, the only th ing I -- stands out is 
my  be -- holid ays that we had, wh ich oh, 
the holid ays were so happy time. My mo
ther was busy cooking and the children 
would co me over. An d she already had gran dc
hildren, I was young -- I was only, in 
that time w h en they started 
coming in , 10 years and we already had grandchildren, I 
was their uncle already, at the -- at the age 
of -- of 10 or 12, I was already an uncle. 
So that made me -- I was playing with th
e little kids. I was one of them. And that 
was the happiest time. And you sang at th
e table after you finish eating, it was a 
happy time, we enjoyed ourself. 
Q: Please tell me  about the beginning of th
e war. What was your experience at the 
very beginning? 
A: Well, at the beginning, I 
wa -- my  father passed away and I would have to go the 
morning to lon -- to the city, I could say 
Kaddish in the mo rning. And as I went 
there, I used to hear the airplanes 
coming already overhead. And the -- the 
synagogue had metal roof and I could hear
 banging on top th  -- from the shrapnels 
were hitting it and it was noisy. But it didn™t
 scare me, I did my job, I went to 
synagogue, came back home to Mom. And we
 didn™t see anything yet, but then all 
of a sudden one night we go to sleep, we
 get up in th e mo rning, we woke up very 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

early in the morning, the Germans invaded 
our city, and the whol
e city was shaking, 
it was a little, small to wn, we have co
bble -- cobble o-of
 the streets with 
cobblestone, not regular cement, so it wa
s noisy and the houses were shaking and 
there was -- like it was terrible noise. The ai
rplanes with the tanks
 with the -- with 
the big trucks coming th rough, and it was 
a small town, I don™t think I ever saw a 
car in my town. Maybe a bus coming throu
gh with some people transporting, but I 
never saw heavy -- heavy equipment like this
 before, so that was fascinating me 
once I -- I woke up in the mo
rning to look out the windo w. And they looked very 
scary, but as a child I wasn™t -- I didn™t
 fear them, you know, I didn™t know what 
they were like until later on. You know, 
later on things changed. They kept 
[indecipherable]
 right away you ga -- within ab
out, I would say two or three 
weeks, maybe not even three 
weeks they already singled us out, all the Jews were 
singled out. I mean, we 
looked Jewish, we had 
pa yo s
, we wore the tz -- th-the -- the 
tzitzit, 
we had -- were never bareheaded . So
 they knew  who we were, but the 
payos
, the curls under you -- that gave it aw
ay anyway already, but still they s-
singled us out, the we -- they gave us -- th
e order came out that said we have to  
wear the Star of 
David
, I think from four years on, a child four years and up we had 
to wear the yellow star, one in the front an
d one in the back. So 
that was right away 
identification right there for us. And th en
 they were coming around later on in the 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
13
streets, grabbing you fo r doing all kinds 
of dirty work  for them. And they would 
kick you and they will hit 
you an-and cuss you in their own language. And we did -- 
you know, you didn™t get good
 treatment at -- tried to 
help them working for them, 
but they  mistreated you.  
Q: You mentioned that the Jewish boys we
re easy to identify because they had the 
payos
 and everything. Was there -- was there 
any segment of the Jewish population 
in your town that was not religious? 
A: True, true. We had some that didn™t have those, the 
payos
 on, not as religious, it 
was still religious, but that -- not religi ous. But of course in the -- the Germans 
knew who th ey were, and if they  didn™t 
know where they  were
, the Polish -- the -- 
th-the Gentiles from that city
 soon pointed them out to
 them, who the Jews are. 
Q: Were there any acts taken against th
e Christian population at the beginning? 

A: At the beginning the only th ing I rememb er was my  -- I was introdu -- 

introduced to hanging. I was watching na
 -- I wasn™t really watching them hanging, 
but the next day I saw them hanging. Ther
e was at least 1 0  to 12 people who -- 
there was some Jews. For what reason they
 were, I don™t know. The Polish, some 
Gentiles were hung on
 the same h anging 
[indecipherable]
 and there were like 10 
who were hanging th ere for about, I would sa
y, a week. They left
 them on for us to 
look at them. There were two Jews and th
e rest of them were Gentiles. We don™t 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

14
know what the reason they h
ung them for, but that™s the 
introduction, I got to see 
people right away, you know, hanging. I ne
ver witnessed that before in my life. 
Q: How soon did th at happen? 
A: I would say within a w
eek. Within a week. They mu
st have known those people 
already, who they are, and 
when they came in -- I™m sure
 they mu st have had some 
spies in the city to see who was who. 
Q: How did they civilian population react
, both the Christian population and the 
Jewish population to 
the German invasion? 
A: Well, they couldn™t do anything. They
 -- they -- no matter what -- they might 
have been talking in  private to one anothe
r, but I don™t know wh
at the -- everything 
went about the regular way to work  and co
me home and that™s it, they didn™t both er 
us with the, you know, from beginning 
[indecipherable]
 was still to go to 
synagogue still, but this -- we went all --
 later on, we s -- they -- they stopped all 
that. 
Q: Walk me through the changes. How did th
ey start to change from just the star on 
the front and back  to some of the other chan ges that were mentioned? 
A: Well, th-the first thing they change is 
in, I™d say less than a -- I was less than a 
year, I believe that they chased us out of
 our homes. We have th
e -- an-and we went 
to -- they -- they put a -- a ghe
tto, they made us a ghetto in
 our city. And most of the 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
15
Jews were living around the area s
ynagogue anyway. We 
lived next to the 
synagogue, so our -- our zone -- we stayed
 in the house. And -- but we had to  take 
other people in, because for -- 
what they did, if you lived 
in a -- in a section with the 
non-Jewish area, you have to leave that area 
and co me into the Jewish area and that 
area was -- they -- they made that a 
ghetto. And th ey blocked off all the 
intersections, they put barbed
 wire at every intersection with a guard and a dog, and 
you could no lee -- you could not leave unle
ss you had a permit, a pass, or if you™re 
going to  wo rk. That™s the only way. And th
en, of course, it overcrowded -- and then 
we had, from the outskirts, some Jewish farmers we had, that lived in the little 
shtetls
, outskirts of the city. And if the Germ
ans didn™t know, th
ey took a non-Jew 
with them, a Gentile on the -- on the 
Jeep
 to show them wher
e the Jews lived. And 
then they rounded
 them up and they told them to 
leave. Left the house. Whatever 
you take with you, they ™ll let you take a 
few suitcases, whatever
 you want and you 
had to wo und up in this ghetto. And of 
course, overcrowd ed. You had to put up 
people, help to one another. So  food was scar
ce, starting to get scarce, sort of every 
day less, le ss, le ss and less. People were br
ibing the soldiers, th
ey had something to 
bribe them with, but then as
 the thing got around you di
dn™t have anything to bribe 
them with any mo re, ev erything you had y
ou gave away  already.
 So, you couldn™t 
even bribe them then
. So you -- then there was a lo
t of suffering going on with -- 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
16
especially with food and -- and health too,
 because we had the overcrowding caused 
the -- the sanitary conditions were very 
bad and typhus broke
 out. And wh en th e 
typhus broke out then
 they -- they would pick up the 
people with -- that had fever, 
took them with trucks away
 and we no longer saw them
 any more. They sh ot them 
and killed them and buried
 them somewhere in the 
outskirts of that city. 
Q: You mentioned that you were in the 
area became the ghetto, you already lived 
there. Were you aware of the procedures th
at the Germans used to ge -- to get the 
other Jews to move into  that area, or had 
y -- were you aw are of it at the time or had 
you heard about it -- 

A: Yes, I did. By that time I was already aware of 
[indecipherable]
 we were 
talking in pil -- in Yiddish, 
wha-what they doin
g to us? They  crowding us up, they 

pushing us in in one area. We
 -- I see streets that I was ab
le before to go out, go 
freely, move about wherever I wanted to, 
I could not go in no mo re there, I had to 
stay, wait for him to let me out for some 
reaso n , unless I went 
to work. That™s the 
only way you could leave the -- the area. Otherwise, you stay put. 

Q: What about job assignments? 

A: Job assignments they -- they -- we knew somebody in  that factory, in the 
ammunition factory, and th e -- the -- the ma n in charge of the factory gave us jobs. 
They  gave me a job, at my  
age and also my three sisters 
had jobs in there. And so 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

17
we were able to go from the facto ry backinto the ghetto by -- by permit. You know, 
we work ed, we didn™t get anything over 
there, no more than you -- you eat a little, 
whatever they gave you in -- in the ghe
tto, you -- whatever your portion was and 
then when you went to the factory, they ga
ve you a little bit of soup in the factory at 
that time, and then 
back home. We did -- worked al
ong the Gentiles, we worked 
along, wh atever they did, we did the same  
work they did. We di
dn™t get paid, they 
got paid. We got cursed  at, we got beaten
 for it, they didn™t
. That™s the only 
difference I could start seeing at 12 years old,
 I -- it was hard for me to -- what™s the 
word ? Co mp rehend, I guess, or to understand
 why, why? What do they want? We -- 
what did I do to  them that they ha -- give me that type of a treatment. 

Q: Which sisters wo
rked with you? 
A: I had 
Faige
 and 
Chaja
 and 
Yita
. And I was sort of the youngest on the line. 
Yita
 
was two years older than I was. 
Chaja
 mu st have been maybe 
three years older than 
the other sister. And 
Faige
 was already married. She ha
d a child, a four year old 
child, and her husband was also in 
America
. He left -- th ey liv
ed in a city called
 
Kielce 
and in 1937 too, he left for the 
United States
, hoping to bring his wife, my 
sister, and a little, four year old little girl to 
America
, and that never materialized 
because of the war broke 
out. So my 
sister left
 Kielce
 and moved in with us, wh ere

we were, and we sort of -- we stayed to
gether, so had the little
 child, my mother 
would watch her during the day so th
at -- you know, take care of her. 
Q: You mentioned that the ghetto was su
rrounded by barbed wire. Was there any 
other enclosure around the ghetto? 

A: Well, it wasn™t really by barbed wire, onl
y the streets, the fi 
-- the street corners 
were barbed wire 
[indecipherable]
 wire, just say all aro u nd -- all around it, no. We 
had just the intersections that you could no
t leave. They know 
wh ere to block them 
off to keep  you with in the premises of the ghetto. 

Q: And who guarded the ghetto inside or outside? 

A: Well we had 
SS 
men and also the Ukrainians wh
o joined the Nazi regime, an d 
they were really vicious too, just the 
same as the Germans 
were. They were our 
guard s, and of course with the -- 
with their dogs with them, too. 
Q: Were they outside 
the ghetto or inside? 
A: They stayed outside, 
sort of, in the corner. 
Q: Was there any guarding, or any 
police service inside the ghetto? 
A: We had some Jewish policemen who -- w
ho they assigned to keep a little bit of l 
-- law and order, what they thought, la
w and order. The Germans really were 
[indecipherable]
 interested in our law. But they
 helped people, you know. They

were more communicating with the guards. Ea
sier to -- p o lice to -- to talk to the 
guard  than  us individually. 
Q: Was there a 
Judenrat
 in your s -- in your ghetto? 
A: Ah, what is? 

Q: A 
Judenrat
, a government. 
A: A government? I di -- I can™t remember
 that, I was too young
. I don™t remember 
if they had something. 
Q: In your ghetto was it only Jews from your town ? 
A: Well, from our town and also the su
rrounding areas. The 
little st -- the little 
villages, the little 
shtetls
. We had quite a few little ones,
 you know, some of them 
maybe 10 miles away, 15 miles away from th
e city and they would also bring them 
into us, overcrowded. And we were al
ready overcrowded anyway, we had small 
homes and big family, but that
 -- we were able to, you know, help out one another. 
Q: How did people get along inside the ghetto? 
A: We got along pretty good, I would say.
 We didn™t have any problems with one 
another, because we knew each other from be
fore, and so it wasn™t too bad. I mean 
wi -- we didn™t have any disagreement w
ith one another, no, not in the ghetto. 
Q: Did you witness any beatings or 
killings or suicides
 in the ghetto? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
20
A: I didn™t see any suicides in the 
ghetto. Beatings I saw, if somebody did 
something, I saw the Germans would throw 
a man down and kick
 him, what reason 
I don™t know, I wasn™t ne -- I was too frigh
tened to go find ou
t why, so I stayed 
away. But I did witness it, I saw them ki
cking them with their boots and hitting 
them with their rifle butts 
as they were laying on th
e floor, on the ground. I did 
witness that. But what the pe
rson did, I don™t know. To
 me I think just merely 
because he want to beat him up. 
Q: Were you aware of anybody escaping th e ghetto? 
A: The ghetto was not too hard, you could 
really get out if you want to. There was 

ways, we found out how to get out so
 they don™t see you. But there was 
[indecipherable]
 where are you going to  escape to, 
because they will report you in 
a second and bring you back 
and th en you would either 
get killed on the spot, or 
they would make an example out of you. So  they, you know, they treated you real 

bad for that. I do remember though, my mo
ther would sneak out sometimes to get 
food from the farmer. We knew
 some of them because we
 would do work for them 
before, she happened to kno
w this farmer. And she would sneak out in -- early in 
the morning and go to a fa
rm and bring back a little b
it of milk and some bread 
sometimes. But that stopped after awhile 
[indecipherable]
 was unable -- they found

21
out the area where we sneaking 
out and they s -- they closed
 it up. That was just in 
the beginning.  
Q: While you were in the ghetto, what 
did you know about wh at was happening in 
other parts of 
Poland
? 
A: Myself, nothing. All I know is I was only 
interested within ou
r city, what they 
doing to  us. I wasn™t aware what they did 
anywhere else. I was too young perhaps, I 
don™t know. Maybe my  w -- my  mo re -- brothers might have known , I personally 
didn™t, until later on. 
Q: When  you went to work , 
you said you worked with  
Jews, and there were some 
non-Jews at work? 
A: That™s right. We worked 
with the non-Jewish populati
on in the factories, in the 
ammunition factories with them. But fl -- ri
ght after that, they had nothing to  do 
with you. They were sort of
 like -- didn™t go near you, didn™t have nu -- even  though 
they -- before you -- w-we called each ot
her, you know, so to speak, by the first 
name. And then as we were working with
 them, they didn™t say hello and they 
didn™t say any -- a wo rd to you, they just
 -- that you were -- not existed. And they  
know that they could have helped , they co
uld have brought a piece of bread, they  
could have brought a -- a -- a raw potato or 
extra piece of bread for lunch. Throw it 
on th e floor, somebody -- we™ll find it, don™t worry. The Germans won™t see you

handing it over to me personally, just thro
w it my  way. I™m working alongsid e you, 
I™ll pick it up. But we -- no su
ch thing was done. So they 
were not that friendly to 
us.  
Q: Were there transports leaving the ghetto? 
A: I don™t think so, not from our ghetto. We  kept sort of thi -- because what they 

did, they  put every -- m-mo st
 of them to work, because 
we had -- we even had a -- a 
stone quarry we had, people wo rking do
wn -- I remember my job too, at the 
beginning I was working up there, cutti
ng up the big rocks for small rocks, 
chopping them up, and they gave you a ce
rtain amount you had 
to do fo r the day. 
Like you buy a cord  of wood here, that™s how
 we would pile up the stones, and they 
measured to make sure that they -- th
is -- you did your day™s wo rk. But that was 
even before the factory, I 
was working there. And what 
else can we say about this, 
what -- we were working in the 
[indeciphera ble]
 but they kept us busy, we -- I 
mean, everybody was busy. If they -- if you di
dn™t go to work in
 the factory, they 
came in with the trucks, picked you up in 
the -- they™ll pick you 
up in the -- in the 
ghetto, lo ad you up on a tr
uck, take you away. Woma
n, man, don™t make any 
difference, you go out and clean
 their vehicles, clean thei
r barracks where they live. 
The women would have to wash their laundr
y for them. And I™m sure we didn™t get 
paid, we -- all we got is beating. But --

Q: -- and taken off to work
. What happened to them? 
A: Well, not in the street, they came in 
-- into the ghetto w
ithin the compound and 
they would just grab people 
[indecipherable]
 men and wo men and sometimes 
some of them wouldn™t show back up. So  
what they did with 
them, they either 
killed them somewhere or they shipped th
em away somewhere, we don™t know, I 
don™t really know, but quite a 
few they did that. But as Isay, for me to remember, I 
don™t rememb er who they were
, I know they were friends. 
Q: How long were you in the ghetto? 

A: The ghetto I was from, I believe ab
out til -- from 1939 -- I know I was there til 
October the 27 -- I do rememb er one -- vividly one day, October the 27
th
, 1942. We 
were -- up til then we were in the ghetto 
and October then came 
and they came out 
on the loudspeakers early in th
e mo rning, they  banged on 
our doors with the rifles, 
scared to death, early in the morning, 
ra us, raus
, everybody out. Where we going? 
To the marketplace. Everyone had to l
eave the area of the 
ghetto into the 
marketplace. And we had to wait for the peop
le to come over at night for the night 
shift, I wa -- I had the night shift from 
11 to seven in th e mo rning. When  I came 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
24
from the factory they  did not take us back
 to the ghetto, we went right to the 
marketplace. In the marketplace we all hadto stand around it until -- from five a.m., 
I would say about til three in the afternoon,
 until -- til th e selection started. They -- 
they started picking the -- before that 
even, people were comi
ng towards the -- from 
the ghetto towards the marketplace to walk
. It was a little distance, I don™t know 
exactly the amount of the distance, but on
 the way there th ey 
were -- the Germans 
were screaming loud, 
schnell
, fast, fast. And children 
would get separated from 
their mo thers, and you could hear th
e children screaming Mom, they were 
screaming for their mothers, the children 
-- and the mothers would scream for the 
babies, they got lost for a second or so. It 
caused a lot of turmoil to -- to -- to get all 
these people lined up in th
e marketplace. And they finally
 did line them up with the 
selection and th at guy -- we stayed, and he
 would say left, right, left, right. And of 
course, th-the old -- the old ones, the old pe
ople and th e real young, they would take 
them right over to one section. They didn™t 
go right, left, they just take them over, 
you -- looked at you, you were
 old, over to the section. If you had children, over to 
the section. I had one of my sisters with
 two children. She held onto them, both 
girls. That was the -- my sister™s named 
Reisl
. She held onto the two children with 
my mother, they held 
on, stayed together. My other si
ster worked at night with me, 
Faige
. We came in the morning, so the child
 was with my  grandmother -- with the 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
25
child™s grandmother, which was my  mo the
r. And when the child
 saw her mother, 
she was screaming for her, she wanted he
r mother, but her mo
ther -- she started 
running over to the moth
er and the German would 
start hitting her, kicking 
[indecipherable]
 back to the grandmother. He 
would not let her go over to th e 
sister -- to -- to -- to my sister, which 
was the child™s mother. 
And the ch-child was 
crying. She finally quit crying an d my  
-- my mother, whic
h was the child™s 
grandmother, held onto her. Until this wa
s lined up and I woul
d say at -- by five 
o™clock it was -- everything was straightened
 out. They took the old people and the 
real young and marched them towards the 
railroad yard. And th
e people that they 
picked, th e younger ones, th
ey looked like the ones that had already jobs and the 
ones that didn™t have jobs, but they  looke
d young, strong, were moving over to one 
area. And after the old ones marched away 
from us, then they started on us. They 
start lining us up again, checking us ov
er again. And on the 
way when the people 
left towards the railroad yard  we could 
hear screams going on, we could hear the 
rifle shootings were going, maybe they shot
 in the air, I don™t know, but there was a 
lot of commotion going on until 
these people were settled 
towards the railroad yard. 
And ones then they -- we heard they pack
ed them in and we heard the train, the 
noise of the locomo tive and 
we knew they were head
ing away. We didn't  know 
where they  were going, we never did know wh
ere. They went to 
us, they lined us up 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

26
again and they told us five
 in a row, and line up, and th e Germans were standing 
there, and -- with the guards and the Uk
rainians. They  even had the Lithuanians 
with them, too, who joined the Nazi regi
me. Those were also no good. Very, very 
bad. And they lined us up and th ey told
 us to march, start marching. And we 
marched. And you had little satc
hels with you, they told 
you to take whatever you 
want with you, so you gra -- how much di
d I have? I had a little satchel with me, I 
don™t even  know wh at was in
 it. Mother packed
 it for me, she said you take this 
with you. So wis -- when we were heading 
towards the destinati
on where they told 
us to go to march -- and on
 the way they kept beating 
us too, we didn™t walk too 
fast, then they told 
us to jog. And it was all u phill.
 And the place we were heading 
for was six and a half kilometers from the 
market. It was hot to -- October, very hot. 
Usually it™s cool already, but that was a ve
ry hot October. We didn™t have anything 
to drink from five a.
m. in the morning 
[indecipherable]
 to drink, no water, nothing. 
And on the way they  kept beating us a
nd -- and some people were falling down on 
the ground. Then  they
 beat them up and they  made 
us lift them up again and walk 
with them, he-helping them along. We fina
lly did come to the destination and we 
looked and there was a camp fo
r us. And we were not aware of it in this outskirts of 
the town that they built -- 
in fact, there was two camp
s. They took one bunch over 
to one sa -- area, to one camp, and one to
 another, was two camps in that city. And 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
27
that was the 
Arbeitslager,
 the -- what they call a slav
e labor camp. They -- they 
didn™t have any electric wires around us, th
ey had regular barbed wire. But they had 
the guard s on th e towers and they had guard
s below. And barracks. And that was a 
surprise for us, I suppo -- we didn™t even
 know what was going on
 there. They built 
it secretly. We kn
ew nothing of 
[indeciphera ble]
 of it until we go -- finally got 
there to the gate and the loudspeak er
 again out, and he says everybody 
a chtung , 
a chtung
 whatever their name is 
and whatev er they said, and they  said empty your 
pockets, all that -- what you bring with 
you, dump into  a little box, there™s a box 
sitting there on the side, and the satchels we
nt into the box. Th
ere was another box, 
they said, take all your jewelry, all money,
 dump  it into this 
other box. And you™d 
better aboi -- abide by it because you will get 
killed. So we all listened, of course 
you had to do it, othe
rwise you don™t want to get k
illed over there, so you search 
yourself, make sure you don™t have a nick
el left. Empty your pock et, you empty it, 
everything, with the jewelry 
and threw it in. They pile it 
[indecipherable] 
behind 
the gate of the camp, and assigned us to
 different barracks. We came into the 
barracks and all they had was empty bunks.
 Was nothing over there, just wood. 
They put us three to a bunk. It was, I thi
nk, three or four bunks high. And --and they 
had nothing, no water, not a thing for us, just
 shoved us into th
ose barracks. And we 
didn™t get out from those ba
rracks until five a.m. in 
the morning the following 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

28
morning. The -- the -- 
the loudspeaker again,
 aus,
 everybody 
aus, aus, aus, aus. 
And then  they would give us the 
[indecipherable]
. The ones who had jobs work ing 
in the ammunition factory, line up to one ar
ea. So we all knew where, you know, we 
were already 
[indecipherable]
 so we stood in one area, then he filled in others with 
us, then they  marched us toward s the factor
y. As we came into the factory, we were 
-- they™re like a -- a -- a herd 
of cows. We were walking in and they were stand with 
the long whips and they™re beating on us 
[indecipherable]
. And the overseer with 
the 
SS
 man was right there with him. With the dogs barking and screaming, 
grabbing your legs if you didn™t walk fast
 enough, or your clot
hes. And I remember 
there was this shouting shout 
[indecipherable]
 we didn™t walk fast enough to the 
gate. And that was a regular ritual with 
them, in the morning 
to go in we got a 
beating and then when
 we left we got a beating. E
ither way we didn™t walk fast 
enough 
[indecipherable]
 a good excuse, because we were all bunched up in  one 
area, trying to get through the gate so th
at we can go about -- to march back to  the 
camp, and we™d always get beatings over
 there. And th en, you know, once we got 
up to  the -- inside the factory comp ound, 
we all knew wh ere our stations were. And 
the new ones were assigned to the areas 
wherever they assigned them to. And we 
stayed there in that factory til almost -- 
I would say til 1943, or
 -- or the beginning 
of ™44, we stayed in that 
Arbeitslager
. And there too, typhus
 broke out. Very bad 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
29
typhus, I had it myself.  And I lost a sist er that  way. One of my sister s, 
Chaja
, they 
drove in a truck one mo rning before I ca
me back from work, th
e night shift. And 
seven o™clock instead of letting us into th
e -- to the camp, they
 would let us in 
between the barbed wire, like 
six feet apart or something 
like that. And all of us had 
to stay in the barbed wire
 til the tw o truckloads came out of the camp. And these 
were supposedly going all in
fected  people with the ty
phus. And we no lo nger saw 
them after that. That™s -- I lo
st one sister right there. Of course, the others, in the 
beginning when  we had -- when  the -- what
 do you call it, the 
-- when they took 
everybody, the old and the young
 away, in the beginning I lost a si ste r there, too, in 
another town. Bu t that™s how I lost one of
 them. The other sist
er, my t -- the -- the 
one that was two years older than I was, 
she came down with typhus. And they had, 
believe it or not, so to speak, a hospital. Th
ere was one room at that bunk, one bunk 
bed, on one side, one bunk 
bed on the other side. No bl
anket, no nothing to cover 
yourself with, just plain old wood. And I 
still til today don™t kn
ow why they didn™t 
kill her and why they let her stay in that
 little hospital. She stayed there -- I would 
check on her every morning 
when I come in from work, 
whenever I got off I would 
always go in to check on her, see how sh
e is. And one morning I came in, she was 
no longer there. So I went 
up to the Jewish 
policeman which I knew, and I said -- 
his name was 
Muttle, Muttle Hilf.
 I said -- I ran into him and I said, 
Muttle
, what 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
30
happened to my sister? He 
said, she died during the nigh
t and we already buried her 
in the bottom of the stone quarry 
[indecipherable]
 a stone quarry, and we buried 
her there, but the two -- one that was two 
years older than I was. So I was only left 
with one more sister in  the camp, 
Faige
. And I lost her too, as we going to come 
into it. We stayed there in
 this camp, then we -- the 
-- the Russians advanced a little 
bit from the east comin g  in, and then we
 could hear the ar
tillery pounding already 
and we knew something wa
s going on. So my sister
 Faige
 and this Jewish 
policeman got together, and there was another Jewish policeman who -- his name 
was
 Moishe Herblum
, he was sort of related to us
, a distant cousin. She and him 
got hooked up to  wo rk out some way that we
 going to  try to escape from that place. 
And I came home from the shift -- that -- that 
shift I had from three to 11 that e -- in 
the night. Came home 11, she lo oked me up
, my  sister and sh e says, we™re going to  
escape tonight, don™t tell anybody, no one. I 
said, okay. So she -- 
I said, when am I 
going to  know when  to run? Sh e says, I™ll co
me and get you. So  she says, just be 
ready, stay in front of the door in  -- of
 the barrack and I™ll come and get you. She 
and the policeman came along an d got me. By that time other people knew it 

already too, because I saw a lot of commo
tion, people were running. And somebody 
got into the -- to the barbed
 wire and cu t through the ba
rbed wire. And as we were 
running, the ike -- the cue was if the lights 
are off, we run. So the lights were off. So 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

31
the people what their mission was to cut th
e wires, they did the job. And a lot of 
people was -- tried to fight through that little
 area to get out, a
nd they got entangled 
to one another, and a lo t of commo tion. By th at time the guard  heard a lot of -- mo re 
noise going on, so he took the lights and put
 the searchlight towa
rds that area where 
he heard the noise and he saw people were
 running out. He opened fire and I was 
running with  my  sister and 
the Jewish policeman togethe
r, and I got hit in the head, 
wounded, and I dropped. My sister, after 
I dropped I don™t know wh at happened to 
her, o-or to the policeman. I 
know people were running 
back, the lights went on and 
people were running in every direction, 
in, out, in and out.
 Somebody ju mp ed on 

me with a 
[indeciphera ble]
 and put a scar on here, I was bleeding from here, I was 
bleeding from my head until I 
-- they were stampeding me. 
So I finally woke up and 
came -- a few seconds, I came up to myse
lf, I said -- I started screaming for my 

sister,
 Faige, Faige
, and I didn't h ear from her. So 
I said to myself, why don™t I go 
into he -- the women™s barrack and look fo
r her. So, I was a little 
bit disor-oriented, 
I didn™t know which -- I lost a lot of bl
ood, and I did manage to go into the 
women™s barrack, which she shouldn™t have go
ne in, but I took a chance, I went in 
there. The -- the lady in ch
arge of the barrack was one
 of our Jewish women from 
our city, so I knew her, sort 
of. So I figured she™s not go
ing to bother me too much. 
I went, 
Faige, Faige
 in th -- in the barracks, no 
Faige. 
So my -- my first cousin,
 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

32
Ida,
 she was my first cousin, she says, what
 are you sh -- she says, what are you 
looking for? I was looking for 
Faige
, have you seen
 Faige
? She says no, she™s not 
here. And then she saw I was bleeding 
[indecipherable]
 from my head, so she 
grabbed that shirt, dipped it in some water 
[indecipherable]
 I put it on my  head, 
tried to stop the bleeding, and -- and I co
uldn™t leave that women™s barracks that 
night, I had to stay overnight there, unde
rneath th-the last b
unk, I squeezed myself 
underneath there. And she told me to holdthis over my  head, which I did. And th en 
-- because all night long they 
were -- they were angry that we were trying to escape, 
so they were shooting all ni
ght long in to the barrack wi
th  the -- with the rifles, 
boom, boom -- with the machine guns, 
boom, boom, boom, boom, all night long, 
until early in the morning it stopped, I snuc
k out of there and went into -- back to 
my barrack. And three days later the ru
mor was sure, that we are going to be 
shipped out. My sister didn™t tell me that
, but that™s the reason they wanted to 
escape, because we going to be
 shipped out. And one to th
e other was talking, they 
said here we helping, actually, the German
s. Everybody has a job, we work in the 
ammunition factory, and all 
kind of copper fo undries, each
 one had a job. We were 
actually helping the Germans, and if they sh
ip us out of here, where can they take 

us? To probably  
[indecipherable]
 extermination camp. We didn't k n ow. So my 
sister was trying to escape with me a
nd the policeman. Now, 
the rumor later was 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

around, saying that the undergro und was sup
posed  to have met us there. There was -
- the way they worked it out, 
they wouldn™t tell me anythi
ng about it, they didn™t 
want me to know, in case I get caught or so
mething, so I don™t have nothing to tell 
them. It was all arra -- arrange
d with the partisans, who we
re supposed to meet that 
-- at 11 - 12 o™clock in the night, and to
 eliminate the guard and knock the lights 
out. And it so happened there was an air raid, so the lights we nt off anyway, and 

there was -- got a little bit mixed up. It so
 happened that the 
-- the partisans never 
showed. Maybe they got some
 problems, they never showed. So  we proceeded with 
our stuff that we said we going to do, we 
did. So, a lo -- some of them did escape, I 
don™t know how many, so the next mo rnin
g roll call they wanted to  see how many 
escaped, so they chas
ed everybody out fro
m the barracks and they  would start to 
count the names and the -- and they marched us over to th e place wh ere -- where we 
were trying to escape, we cut through the 
wires. And right in the front of us there 
was the policeman, wounded. My sister wa
s there, but she was dead. But there was 
about, I would say 10 - 15 pe
ople laying there, mo aning and mo an ing and groaning, 
blood -- lot of blood flowing around and -- 
and th ey made us look and they  took th e 
machine gun and killed every one of them. A
nd they said this is the lesson that you 
will learn. If you escape, that™s what w
ill happen to you. So 
from now on, stay put, 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
34
don™t -- don™t escape any mo re. And th is is the lesson that we learned right there. 
And sure enough, within about 
four or five days later we 
were shipped out of there.  
Q: Didn™t any of the Germans notice your
 head  wo und, or your chest wound from 
the 
[indecipherable]
 

A: The head -- the chest wound  they couldn™t see cause 
I wore the jacket on top, 

you know, th -- they couldn™t see that. Bu
t my  head  wo und th ey co uld have seen , 
but we were -- we had ba -- you could w
ear anything you want on your head, a 
beret, or a hat. Then wa -- in that camp
, it wasn™t where you had a striped uniform 
yet. We didn't get that til later, we were 
wearing our ra -- normal clothes, a pair of 
pants and a shirt, whatever 
you had, you wore. So I had 
a beret and I covered it up, 
and they  didn™t see it at all. And of c
ourse I washed ev eryt
hing away from the 
[indecipherable]
. And they didn™t check me over at 
all until I got to the destination 
where -- I™m going to tell you where I came
 to, and then they asked questions.  
Q: How did these wounds heal? 

A: The wounds did not heal until I was liberated in 19 fort -- April 25
th
, 1945, I 
[indecipherable]
 1945 of April the army medics, 
U.S.
 medics treated it for me. It 
would get infected and re-infected, infected
 and re-infected for so long a time. Only 

time it felt good, when you 
took a shower, finally they 
let you get -- washed it, so 
the scab washed off and then
 th e new scab came on the -- of course, you know with 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
35
the sanitary conditions being so
 bad, that infected again, 
so that™s what I said, didn™t 
heal up til I was heal -- til the vet -- the ar
my medics helped me after the war, after I 
was liberated.  
Q: When  this wound was not healing pr
operly, did you have pain an d fever? 
A: I would get a lot of headaches from 
that. Until today I still feel headaches, I 
think it™s maybe contribute to that, I™m not sure. Whether I got fever, I don™t know. 

I did get typhus, I had fever. So I™m aware 
of what -- what feve
r is, but you know, 
you had so many other problems
, this was just a little minor
 thing in your life, other 
than the woun
d, you know. 
Q: How big was your ca -- 
A: I would say about three inch
es long. Right in the back 
here, in my h
ead. By just 
a little bit, maybe an eighth of a 16
th
 of an inch deeper I wo
uldn™t have been here 
talking to you -- this interview here.  
Q: So it was just a flesh wound? 
A: A flesh wound, but it opened up almo st
 to the scalp, almost to the bone it 
separated. Was pretty deep. 
Q: When you told me abou
t going into the women™s ba
rrack, you said the -- the 
woman th at was in charge was from your town . 

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
36
Q: Were there other Jews from othe r towns in this camp with you? 
A: Yes, there were some other people in 
th at camp , ou-out of towners too, yes, 
because they kept brining 
in extra people every -- ev
ery week, every day they 
brought a few extra ones in. And so me of
 them looked pretty strong when  they 

came in already to our camp
 towards the end, we were already weaklings. We™re 
not skeletons yet, but we were 
[indeciphera ble]
 weak. They were still strong, they 
came from some other part maybe, where they 
were not mistreated yet. And so they 
-- when they came into our cam p, then they learned a less
on right there, they gave it 
to them the same treatment we had. And 
people were losing weight. But it wasn™t 
just -- just as bad, you 
could still survive, yeah. 
Q: You also mentioned that after the es
cape attemp t, they took th e wounded and 
they executed them. Were there any other 
executions as a result of that attempt? 
A: No. They were just th
reatening us, saying if we
 would think about again 
escaping, this w-would happen to us. But be
fore that -- before that, the order was, 
one had to watch the other, because some
times we did have escapes. And they 
would take just five out, innocen t peop
le, and kill them because this one person 
would escape. They did that in the beginni
ng when  we went into  
the camp to be told 
-- they were telling that over the loudspea
ker, every day we heard that. But during 
that time th ey just killed -- th
ey -- they just killed the 
wounded that were trying -- 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
37
that were on the other side of the fence,
 which escaped, they were already on the 
other side. 
Q: While you were in this
 camp , did you have any id
ea of wh at was happening 
elsewhere in 
Poland? 
A: Not really, no, because we couldn™t talk 
to the people who we
re on the outside, 
the non-Jews, they wouldn™t te
ll us nothing. Not me, let™s put it this way, I can™t 
speak for the whole town, maybe somebo
dy did know. I did not know what went 
on. But towards the -- later on we hear
d stories that -- not until I got to 
Auschwitz
 I 
heard that -- the rumo
rs what went on.  
Q: Is there anything else that comes to yo
ur mind about this camp, before we leave? 
A: Well, before we left this camp is 
-- the only thing I can rememb er, how th ey 

were doing, they -- they came out -- we had 
like sobriety tests like we have here for 
somebody who drinks and driv
es. The policeman stops you and they  make you walk 
to a straight line. And they -- there 
was one German there, his name  was 
Al -- Alto
, 
that™s the only name I remember, how it™s 
possible that you could only remember 
one miserable man, because he was very ba
d, he was bad. And he was a heavyset 

man, and I remember he™d come in and ev
erybody who was in th
e shift -- the worst 
shift by the way, was night shift, because 
that means you were in the camp  all day 
long. And all the trouble started during the 
day. If they needed extra help they  

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
38
would co me in and drag you out of bed, an
d go do extra work , plus he makes sure 
he brings you back so you 
can go on th e regular shift. 
We might put that day on 16 
hours or 17 hours. And that was the worst 
shift. But he would come in during the 
day and have everybody outsid
e and he wo uld -- like target practice, he would have 
you walk  a straight line. If he knew you 
were sick in bed -- so-sometime you would 
see people laying on the bed with  foaming from their mouth from the high fever 
from the typhus. I had the typhus 
too. So-S ome -- sometime maybe 
[indecipherable]
 or heavy, I don™t know what it is
. My sister, the one who died, she 
had typhus, but for her, hers turned into th
e tu -- tuberculosis I 
think it turned into, 
she never recovered, sh e died. They let her 
die on her own. That was in the a -- in 
the camp yet. And what -- he 
would bring them in and he 
made you walk a straight 
line. If you did -- if you wiggled  a certain wa
y, he would put a bullet in the back of 
your head . And this was like ta-targe
t practice for him. And he had other 

accomplices come with him, to
 show them what he is doing. Trying to show them 
that gee, he could do that 
too. To harden  them up, I gue
ss, like weren 't hard enough. 
And I reme mb er one of my  neighbors, his name was 
Luther, 
I don™t know his last 
name, he was my -- my age, and he ha
d a bad case, cause he was foam -- I 
reme mb er seeing him in the mo rning, he was foaming from the mouth. And he 

would tell us to go out, so we had to l
eave, you could not stay inside or he wo uld 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
39
kill you in your -- in your b
unk if you stayed. And he -- that™s how he died, because 
he was wiggling wh en he was walking, his fe
ver was so high that he could not walk 
straight line. So therefore he shot him in 
the back of the head. 
This is the only one 
that I saw him shooting, by the way, but he
 would do that every so  often, ev ery so 
often. I rememb er this young man when  
he was my  friend, he was my  neighbor 
before, we were living near each other. We  were the tailors and they were the 
carpenters. Yeah, we knew 
each other pretty good.  
Q: Before the escape attempt, had thei
r been any deportations from the camp ? 
A: No, th ey would only bring 
people in, not -- not out, ju
st bringing them in, they 
were bringing ex tra people in from othe
r towns, but who -- I never see anybody 
leaving there until they deported 
everybody out of the camp.  
Q: Tell me about the liquidation of the camp. 

A: The liquidation of the camp, like I say, 
after we tried to escape and th ree days 
later the rumor was true. My sister didn't 
want to tell me, but 
then we found one 
another to see how they -- the people were 
trying to work this 
out with the -- with 
the partisans somehow. And they pulled up
 the train and the camp  was maybe a 
block away from the -- from 
the railroad. We could see 
the railroad yard from far 
away. You know, it wasn™t that far, it wa 
-- maybe it was longer than a block, but 
we could see the cattle cars. A
nd one day they told us to 
line up in the morning, and 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
40
-- and march towards the railway 
yard. Well again the beatings 
[indecipherable]
 on 
the way it was the same thing, that we 
would walk past the -- it w as constantly 
beating, beating with the long
 whips, just like -- just lik
e the cowboys here with the 
herd of cows trying to round them up, it™
s constantly  beating, beating, beating. 
When we finally came towards 
the railroad yard they star
ted to line up people. See, 
you go -- to what wagon to go into, push th
em in. And we were packed in, 125 to 
150, I would say, approximately to i -- to each car. They would set us down  
between each other™s legs so that we coul
d fit more in. And then
 once was full, he s 
-- closed the door up and sealed it up so 
no one can open  it up. And they finally, 
after leaving and we got through, we 
finally pulled aw ay , we could hear the 
locomotives, the noise of loco
mo tives and we were heading 
out, we were three days 
on th e road. No water. We stopped at every 
station. We didn™t know where we were 
going, but we stopped in so many stations
, I know, because this was not a priority 
train, the army has to go 
through first, so there was 
-- they let everybody else go, 
but we stopped in so  many stations, and in
 unison, I remember we were screaming, 

wasser, wasser, wasse r
, and the Germans know wh at 
wasser 
means, because in 
their -- German language I think it™s the same. 
We didn™t ask them to feed us, all we 
asked, water, water. No water was given, 
nothing at the station. We finally did 
arrive -- we finally did arrive at the destin
ation in three days fa -- after three days 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
41
you finally arrived in this camp, it was ve
ry scary for me personally, with -- to see 
all these electric wires with
 the -- with the current woul
d kill us, with seven foot 
tall, they had to be at least, or 10 foot ta
ll. It was a different ballgame there. And as 
we were looking th rough th e barbed wire
, we saw people walking around with 
skeletons, with thin  and striped cap and a 
striped uniform an-and wo oden  shoes, we 
already saw that. But the people who came to
 meet us in the front of the car, they 
pushed those little carts. And they came a
nd told us in Yiddish  that this is 
[speaks 
Yiddish here]
 we were burning, we were burning 
the Jews here. This is not a work 
camp, this is strictly a killi
ng camp. And that™s when we fi
rst got to know about this 
from the -- from the people from 
within the camp, wh
en they met us 
in front of the 
railroad yard . Then they  op
ened up the -- the car, each 
car -- each car separately, 
and they  were saying, 
raus, raus.
 Again the same thing started with selection. 
Right, left, right, left. Even 
-- even we were all, so to 
speak, the cream of the crop. 
We were working. We -- we were healthy,
 so to speak. Still th
ey wanted, still line 
up ag ain people, and they put them off to 
one end, and we went to the other end. 
They took the -- the one end away, we don™
t know what happen
ed to them, til we 
found out later on that they took them
 for gas and killing and then -- and 
[indecipherable]
 right away. With  us they  took us over 
[indecipherable]
 a little bit 
younger, they took us over and we marc
hed toward s the inside, I rememb er. And 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
42
we came up to a big table, and there were 
SS
 men sitting at the table, there must be 
about 10 of them, and they had some kind 
of instruments in their hands. And that™s 
where they were tattooing us. So we rolle
d up our sleeve and they  gave us our 
numbers on the arms.  
Q: What is your number? 

A: My number is 
A18991. A18991.
 And they tattooed ev erybody. Next from the 
tattoo -- and mind you, we still didn™t ge
t any water. We still -- it™s already 
[indecipherable]
 three days now, no water at all, nothing. We were tattooed, then 
they checked us over, th
ey told us to go into 
[indecipherable]
 the barbers were 
standing, and women and men,
 their hair was cut off. Before, in our camp, where 
we came from, the -- the Jewish population in that camp, the women wore the hair. 

They cut their own a little bit shorter, but when we came to 
Auschwitz,
 they 
chopped all the hair off, th
ey took off that the girls 
looked like boys already, 
everybody looked th e same. And that™s wh
en they noticed, the barb er, I don™t know 
whether he was a German, or whether he 
was one of the -- from the camp workers 
[indecipherable]
 but he asked me about my  wou
nd. The first time. He asked me 
about my wound so I 
told him I had a fight inside the car. We were pushing each 
other trying to get to the -- which was tr
ue, we were trying to get to that little 
window to get a breath of air. And there 
was fighting, really 
fighting going on in 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
43
that car with us. And then -- 
so I told him I got hurt that
 way. He took -- he didn™t 
question me after that. Shaved if off. It fe
lt b etter after he cut away all the hair, but 
again it still was infected. And after the ha
ircut they told us 
we had to go get a 
shower. So they 
lined  us up again and like in a m
aze where you couldn™t get out any 
mo re. You got in, you couldn™t 
get out. And we went in, they
 gave us -- they told us 
to leave our clothes on the inside and wh
en  we came  out on th e other end of th e 
shower, we had our striped uniforms re
ady with our wooden shoes and we got 
dressed, went back in to the barrack and 
we stayed there in the barrack. Finally 
somebody brought in some buc
kets of water to get -- to get drink. And you could 
have dranked up a whole bucket yourself
 as thirsty we were. And we -- they 
delivered the water and then 
during th e night -- during the night was a terrible noise 
going on next door to ou
r barrack. Very noisy. 
Q: I™m going to interrupt you for just a 
mo me nt because we need to  change tape. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: -- of the 
United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer collection 
interview with 
Henry Greenbaum
. This is tape number two, side
 A
. And you were 
-- you had finished telling me about your 
transfer from one camp
 to the other, but 
can you give me the names of those camp s, please? 
A: The camp -- my camp was called just an 
Arbeitslager
 camp. And th e factory 
that I worked in was called
 Hermann Goering 
factory. But the destination that we 
evacuated our camp, we came to
 a camp and it was called 
Auschwitz
. And I do 
reme mb er 
Auschwitz
 had this famous sign, 
Arbeit Macht Frei
, work makes you 
free, I guess that™s what the translation is. But that was 
Auschwitz
 that we came to 
before we got -- after -- after the trai
n stopped and we were
 unloading, and the 
Germans were screaming 
aus, aus, aus,
 everybody. So you know
, you have to  jump  
out of the carload real quick
. My -- my legs were enta
ngled with people that I 
thought they were sleeping a
ll night, I thought, because we started on th e floor, and 
when we came to the destination I could to
uch the roof of that car. So I was laying 
on top of other people, and I thought they we
re sleeping. But then
 I found out after I 
got out, got my self free and I jump ed out 
an d I saw all these people -- I don™t know 
the exact amount, but quite a few were dead
, never left the car, because they were 
suffocated, from not giving us any water, 
or enough air. And people were fighting 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
45
with one another trying to get a little bit of 
air. So there was quite
 a few dead on that 
-- on that train.  
Q: When  you say 
Auschwitz
, are you referring to 
Birkenau
, do you know? 
A: 
Birkenau
, 
Auschwitz
, it was in  about the same area where you came to. 
Everybody says 
Auschwitz
, but I believe where you really drive up to is almo st, it™s 
called
 Birkenau
, I think, but -- 
Q: So wer-were your barracks brick or wo od? 
A: I believe ours was wood, wooden barracks, I think. 
Q: Before we had to change
 tape, you were telling me about your first night in -- in 
Auschwitz
. Could you continue? 
A: Okay . After we -- during the night when
 we spend -- in the first night in our 
barrack, we heard a lot of noise going on ne
xt door barrack. I mean, not just noise, 
but screams, screams, people were lik
e with s-somebody be cutting somebody or 
hurting somebody. And th is went on almo st, 
I would say half of the night, until the 
next day we found out from other sources,
 from people around there, from -- that 
had been in this 
Auschwitz
 camp longer than we were 
told us that that night was 
the Gypsy night and they were killing all 
the Gypsies that night. And that™s where 
the noise came from th at we 
found out the next day.  
Q: And your first day in 
Auschwitz
? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
46
A: The first day really not -- well, we di
dn™t do too mu ch over there, just hung 
around in the barrack and just talking to
 one another. And we 
did walk out a little 
bit, we had to wait for our food, they gi
ve us this little piece of bread in the 
morning. A little piece of bread
 th-th-the thickness of two slices of toast, I would 
say. Black bread and some ersatz coffee, 
which was imitation black coffee, we had 
that in the morning, early. And after that
, eating for three days and drinking, this 
was like nothing compared to what we di
d where we were before. But a little bit 
mo re to eat, we had extra soup over ther
e because we -- when  we went to the 

factory, in the 
Arbeitslager
. But here so far w e didn™t ge
t just -- just this bread in 
the morning and the watery so
up in the evening.
 And then  we were hanging around 
every day th e same, talking to one another a
nd we could smell the stench in the -- in 
the -- in the camp. Of course by that 
time I already knew what it was. Th-The 
people that worked th
ere told me, I was aware already what this is -- was. And now 
and then  we would also help picking up b
odies in there. They  would grab  you, say 
come on, go to work, they 
-- and they would give us one
 of these carts, we™d go 
ahead and pull somebody
 just naturally dying in the -- 
on the street. We would take 
them and put them -- put them on a pile ne
xt to the crematorium over there, we™d 
put them in a pile like -- like y -- like you 
pile up wood, they were
 laying there. And 
we didn™t do too much other things than 
that, just a -- until one day. I was there, I 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
47
think about -- I would say at
 least six months, until this
 German well-dressed man 
came in, into the camp. And we -- we were sort of -- we picked
 out the youngest of 
the groups and we lined up and he went and 
gave us a selection, he looked  us over. 
And he would point to
 go over towards him. So I was 
the one that he picked. Went 
over to him, I wasn™t aware of what he pi
cks me for, I w as not 
sure. But then they 
took us on a truck after that and th
ey took us to another camp  called
 Buna, B-u-n-a, 
Buna-M onowice
 I think it™s called. They took us
 to that camp and we got to get 
this man to -- he was giving us jobs. I 
don™t know how many he got out of there, 
maybe it was 50 - 100 people, 
I don™t know th e exact amount. Bu t he took a pretty 
good group, I™d say two truckloads and we went over to 
Buna
. And from -- 
Q: I want to ask, before you get to 
Buna
, I have one or tw o questions 
[indecipherable]
 
Auschwitz
. 
A: Okay . 
Q: You said you were in 
Auschwitz
 for about six months. During that time did 
anybody notice your head wo und? 

A: Nobody. No-Nobody own -- 
nobody even noticed it beca
use when  they gave us, 
it was a striped little cap that I wore. So th
at covered it up, too.
 The only time they 
would see it maybe -- I don™t think they ev
er noticed it on me, but if I did I was 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
48
prepared to tell them that I got hurt on th
e -- on the wagon, on the train, on the cattle 
car. 

Q: While you were there for those months
, just waiting, what 
could you see around 
you? Ho w far could yo
u see around you as to what was happening? 
A: Well, I could see -- I-I was roaming aro
und in the -- in the camp, I was seein g  

what people looked like, they -- they were 
already skeletons in th at camp . We were 
not yet skeletons, we had a little b it more 
food where we came from. And there, the 
people over there, they would ju st look 
like skeletons, it scares you. Some of them 
were laying on the ground, they  couldn™t wa
lk, they couldn™t talk any more, sort of. 

And it™s the only thing that I saw, there 
was not too much to observe except the 
smokestack. You could see the smokestack 
coming -- the -- the -- the smoke out of 
the chimneys. We could see plenty of that, 
but the stench by that time I was already 
aware of what it is. 

Q: From wh ere you were in the camp , coul
d you look out to any area that was not 
part of the camp? 

A: There was nothing to  see, it was just a empty area. I don™t n -- I couldn™t see 

much out there. I could see empty areas 
where I was facing. Maybe some woods far 
away, that™s about the only thing I could see. 

Q: Now tell me about 
Buna
, how did 
Buna
 compare to 
Auschwitz
? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999

A: Well,
 Buna
 was a little bit cleaner than 
Auschwitz
 because 
Buna
 was already 
like a working camp. At least we didn™t ha
ve any crematoriums in there. They did 
have punishment by hanging in  that camp,
 but not crematorium, no burning people 
in that -- 
Buna-Monowice
. And this man picked us up and th e job th at I was 
assigned to was to 
I.G. Farben
 comp any. And so anyway , so we did get -- we were 
still able to get a little bit extra 
soup over there in the -- in the 
Mo nowice
 in the 
factory. So we would get -- actually you 
would get a piece of bread in  the mo rning 
in -- in 
Buna
 with the black imitation coffee. Th
en  around one, two o™clock in the 
afternoon th ey give you a 
little water soup, a little bit extra. And th en when  we 
came home, to home, when  we came home back to the camp, we got another watery 

soup. You had a spoon with you, but belie
ve me you didn™t need a spoon, th ere was 
nothing there to eat with a 
spoon. There was cabbage, y
ou couldn™t find a piece of 
cabbage. Or turnips, you couldn™t find a pi
ece of turnip. It wa
s just watery soup, 
you could drink it. So th at made us a little 
better in that camp, I think, it looked a 
little bit cleaner too in th -- in that 
Buna
 camp. Like I say, every mo rning we would 
get up, and -- get up in the mo
rning, get to -- get this little piece of bread and on the 
way you would -- sometimes they would tran
sport us by truck. If it was foggy -- 
they used  to be very fo ggy
 sometimes there that you 
co uldn™t see but maybe 10 - 15 
feet away in front of you. So
 th ey would put us in trucks
 to take us to the factory

back. Bu t of course -- and in th e factory the same thing what 
happened there. We 
didn™t get as much beating, but you still ha
d guards with you, 
so you had to watch 
your 
[indecipherable]
 you couldn™t talk to one anothe
r. If we did, we -- he™d -- in 
the evening -- they wouldn™t 
bother you wh ile you were ta
lking, but before you left 
to go back  to the camp, they would ca
ll you into a certain area, you know, like an 
office where they were and 
they  would ask you, why were you talking so mu ch to  

this man? What were you talking about?
 What we talking about, we hungry, we 
talking ab out food. We talk about -- we not
 have -- and we talk about the families 
we lost, that kind of talk, that™s all the ta
lking that we did. And one day he didn™t 
take -- he didn™t take that a
nd he gave us -- there were ch
airs that you put your head 
through, your knees on the ground, your st
omach on the seat of the chair, and they 
take your -- take your shirt off and they
 would give you a whipping with a wh ip. 
And wh en you get through, your
 back looked like 
a city map, a road map, with the 
beating th at we used to get. So you were
 actually -- you were not a -- you shouldn™t 
have been able to talk to
 nobody. Just do your work  and don™t say nothing to  one 
another.  

Q: Were you able to form any bonds with
 any of the other prisoners, though? Any 
friendships, though? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
51
A: Yes, we did. We -- we did. We s -- we
 -- we were -- the guys we kept together 
trying to  help one another, we did. Specia
lly by when we were marching later on. 
But then the -- why we -- when
 we came, we sort of kept with  one another too. I 
had this one young man, he was 
my  bunkmate. That happened in  
Buna
. And in 
Buna 
we used to get air raids. And the air raids would come also to the -- to the 
I.G. Farben
 comp any, too. And wh ile we were in 
I.G. Farben 
company, the 
Germans had a German kitchen there for 
themselves, or maybe for the non-Jews, 
too, I don™t know. But all I 
know is whenever the air raid
 came and that young man 
would find out where the kitc
hen was, he was running to the kitchen to see what 

they threw out. And he would sometime come
 back with food, like so -- sour soup, 
old -- old -- that they throw out in the tras
h. And I used to tell him, I told him, I 
said, don™t go, you™re going to  get hurt, 
don™t do that. No , he said, I™m hungry. I 
said, I™m h u ngry too, but I™m not going to 
do this. And he went
, and he finally did 
get caught. When  it™s -- his punishments 
was hanging. Andhe 
didn't listen to me 
when I tried to -- to warn him. He was my 
bunkmate, we were three of us in a bunk. 
He was my age. I don™t remember his name 
it™s been so many years. And we had to 
go out there and watch three -- three guys -- 
three and him, four guys were hung in 
the -- in that -- 
Buna.
 The German got up and he read
 a protocol. I don™t know what 
it was, what he was reading, I didn™t unde
rstand a wo rd he said. And then after he

52
gave the -- the order, and one of 
us -- not me, but the people of 
[indecipherable]
 
and they  had ropes around their neck, and 
he was one of them, I don™t know wh at 
the other ones were punish ed for, but I know he was punish ed strictly for just 
getting just a little bit sour soup out of a 
trashcan that they 
-- that the German 
kitchen th rew outside. That was his puni
sh ment, that™s only no -- that™s the only 
thing I know about it. And after that, after 
th ey were hung, the people who were the 
-- they had a regular band, inst
ead of you know, we all were
 sobbering
 and sorry to 
see this little boy, especially
 me, I felt very bad, my frie
nd. And they  started playing 
with the cymbals and the drums and the th
ings like you go to  a -- to a high school 
football team, what th -- a hi -- a game, when
 they play after it™s
 fin ished. And this 
is what the Germans, they 
-- they think of the -- or -- or -- or the -- the Nazis, 
whatever they were, think of -- of a Jew.
 Or of anybody, to 
kill anybody. Inhumane, 
inhumane, it™s the only thing I can describe
 it, that™s what th
ey are. Inhumane. 
Q: Were you ever beaten? 

A: Oh yes, I got beaten when I was just 
telling you previously , when  he asked us 
why we were talking. And we went to his 
office and he didn™t go
 for it when I told 
him we were talking about fo od and we we
re talking about family, he didn't -- he 
didn't  believe us, so he gave both  of us 
a beating with, like I say, you get on your 
knees, rest your stomach on the ch air, the 
head went th rough the back of the -- of 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
53
the chair, and you t -- withou
t your shirt, and he was wh ipping you with a whip. 
And more you -- more you screamed, more
 beating you got, so you had to calm 
down  and don™t scream, try not to scream 
so maybe he won™t gi
ve you bad beating. 
But I remember my -- for tw
o, three weeks my  back looked like a -- like a road map 
from the beating. 
Q: Was that the only time you were beaten? 

A: That™s the only time I got that kind of
 beating, yes. I used
 to get plenty of 
beatings with the rifle butts, that I got plen
ty. Kick, rifle butt, h
it with the -- slap in 
the face, hit with the -- some
times they would hit you with
 the -- with a ladle when 
you try to -- somebody pushes you to the fr
ont to get the food, you get hit. I don™t 
know who these were, were these 
capos
 or were they Germans, I don™t know, but I 
got hit plenty of times with that, too. 
Mostly rifle butts as you were walking, 
marching.  

Q: How long were you in 
Buna
? 
A: In
 Buna
 I™m not really sure, I think -- in 
Buna
 I think it™s -- I really li -- I think 
maybe also about six or maybe a year to 
something like that, I 
don™t quite rememb er 
the time. B u t I know that the -- the war star
ted already, the allies got into the war, I 
think, at the time. And the Russians were 
coming he -- already in from the east, we 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
54
could hear all this banging away. We saw 
some activities with 
the bombing, so we 
knew something went on. And -- 
Q: Is there anything about 
Buna
, or about 
Auschwitz
 that you didn™t mention that 
you would like to talk about? 

A: Well, th -- 
Buna
 was a little, like I say, we didn
™t have any crematoriums there, 
that™s the only good reas
on, although it probably is not that far away from 

Auschwitz
 anyway, it was a subsidiary of 
Auschwitz
 anyway , and -- and 
Birkenau
, it all in one line, I think, all those 
three. But there is 
-- it was a little bit 
cleaner. I remember I was looking 
out, I used to look out in 
Buna
 and see a sign, it 
was 37 miles or 38 miles to -- to 
Kraków
 and I would always say, if I get out of 
here, that™s where I™m going to go, to 
Kraków
, big city, which I never made it out 
of there, never made it, never mate
rialized. We were shipped out of 
Buna
 when the 
allies, I think, started coming in
, they started bomb -- bombing the 
I.G. Farben
 
company what they were bom
bing that time and I remember
 being with English war 
prisoners in that camp. But they were dre
ssed well, their shoes -- 
they shined -- their 
shoes were shined, they  looked well cleaned,
 well fed and they were working in the 
streets picking up dirt, too, 
like -- and we were working 
in the -- I was -- myself, I 
was building the roads in -- 
in the -- in birk -- in 
I.G. Farben
, my job was to build 
the roads. My job was the cu
rbs, set up the curbs and then
 -- then the guy came with 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
55
the sand, with the cobblestones, you know, 
this kind of stuff, that™s what I learned 
in there after I left the
 -- 
the
 Hermann Goering 
factory, that™s what I did in 
I.G.
, 
building roads. And then I left from ther
e and they put us on the marches again. 
First they put us on trains from there, 
and then the allies were bombing the trains, 
and there was like a cat and mouse. They
 were bombing the rail and then they  
repaired the rail, they started again, and 
again they bombed it.
 So th ey gave up, 
wanted to  start marching us
. And we were marching, marching and I came to a 
place called 
Flossenbürg
 after that. 
Q: Do you know when th
ey marched you out of 
Buna
? 
A: What -- end of ™40 -- it was almost -- pr
obably be ™44 already then , I think. I™m 
not too sure of the dates. 
Q: How long were you marched? 

A: Until I was liberated, march and the 
train, m-mostly marching until I was 
liberated. At first we came to -- to 
Flossenbürg. 
Q: How long to
 Flossenbürg
? 
A: In 
Flossenbürg
 we stayed there, like again, no
t too long, I -- not quite a year, I 
don™t think, we stayed there. And there -- 
my  job over there was to sort clothes and 
there was a pile of clothes, I mean two stories tall. And we were out there s -- 
sorting clothes. Matching up shoes, tie 
them togeth er, me n™s clothes from ladies™ 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

56
clothes separating. Gloves, eyeg lasses, all 
separated in that camp . They  had -- other 
people had other jobs over there, they us
ed to work, I think in a -- in a airplane 
factory, I think 
Messerschmitt 
was there, now that I know
 where it is, I was told 
that there is -- a factory
 
was right there. But my job was 
not that, my job was just to 
sort clothes over there. And there our me
n -- we didn™t do too much, we didn™t, 
except for sorting the clothes. And of 
course we -- by that time we already 
skeletons, starting to lose a lot of weig
ht by then. And I reme mb er one day in  
Flossenbürg
 the Red Cross came  to visit us, and 
we had to clean up that camp  that 
you could not find um -- it was always cl
ean anyway, there was no food to throw 
away, and 
[indeciphera ble]
 paper, nothing, cleaned up clean. And that time they 
gave us, instead of that water soup, they 
gave us -- I -- the only 
way I can describe it 
would be like Cream of Wheat, thick Cream 
of Wheat. And we said wow, all of a 
sudden we™re getting that, maybe because of 
the visitors. We never talked to them, 
we saw them talking to the Germans, a
nd they would come around and pointing 
barracks out. They ev en had us go out ther
e and play soccer in front of them. We 
could hardly walk, but we
 played soccer. You know, we still young, like young 
kids, you don™t care, you still want to kick
 a ball, you know, you were so young yet. 
And I reme mb er them playing and then, coul
dn™t they see our faces? They could see 
how we look. The Red Cross couldn™t be that
 dumb, that naïve that they can™t see 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
57
that we get this kind of food every day, 
that -- the way we looked? They could have 
seen that. Then after they left
, back in to th e water soup. 
Q: During the times th at -- the time 
that you were in these camps, the 
Arbeitslager
 
and then  
Auschwitz
 and th en
 Buna
, did you have any id ea what was going on with 
your remaining siblings? 
A: No. No, I did not know. Fo
r one re -- think I didn™t know is because my -- one of 
my  brothers joined
 the Polish army, 
Za c h a r y
. He was -- they draf
ted in the Polish 
army, so I never knew where 
he was. Then  I had my  ol
dest of the brothers. He 
escaped before the Germans 
came into my town. And by 
that time we were on a 
farm because we were still living in the 
home. So when the 
bombing started my 
mother -- my father was already dead, 
my mother knew this guy at the farm 

[indecipherable]
 used to do work for. He came
 with the horse and buggy and 
picked us up and took us 
into his farm until the bombi
ng stopped. And luckily we 
did because there was a lot of shrapnels in
 our house that flew in with -- from the 
bombs. I mean, big chunks. So we were sort 
of lucky that we didn™t stay there. But 
while we were on the farms, we w ere outside, I remember til today, I was eating 

tomatoes that were like, I mean, real to
matoes, big. Take off the vines and eating 
them in the farm. And my  brother was out there and he saw the soldiers coming 
through with torn up -- thes
e Polish soldiers coming with torn uniforms, and ripped 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

58
[indecipherable]
. So he was t -- asking them in 
Polish, where are the Germans, 
where? He says, they™re not far from here
, you know, maybe a few kilometers from 
here. So he took off, my br
other, walking with that sold
ier somewhere. I ma -- later 
he said he separated from him, but my  br
other walked, he says 1100 miles, I don™t 
know, that™s what he tells me and he went to 
Vilna.
 From
 Poland
 to  
Vilna
 he 
escaped into the woods, and I was trying to  
chase with him, but he chased me back, 
go back to  your mo ther, he 
was -- I -- til today, I -- I 
don™t forgive him that. I tell 
him, I said, why you did not take me with you? He said, what am I going to  do with 
a little boy? I was -- hardly knew where I™m
 going. So I mean, I -- y ou know, I 
could understand that. But he chased me back
 and I went back to my  mo ther and he 
didn™t even say goodbye to 
my mother, he ran off. So Ididn™t know where he was. 

And the others, I already saw the three of
 them die, you know. So -- and then  I 
knew the one sister here. Wh
ere she lived, I did not know
. I know sh e d -- she was 
in the 
United States
, but I didn™t know where. 
Q: How were you transported out of 
Flossenbürg
? 
A: Of 
Flossenbürg 
was strictly marching. Marching from 
Flossenbürg
. Where we 
were marching, I don™t know. 
Q: Describe the march  for me, please.  

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
59
A: Well, we were marching five in a -- in a row. We tried to help each other, if one 
was weak, we tried to put his arms around 
the next one. By that time we sort of 
weak, we lo st our weight already, we st
arted losing weight. And marching in the 
wood s. S ometi me we co me th ro ug h  a town
, and why the German population tell me  
that they -- after liberation th
ey told me that 
they were not aware of all this, is 
beyond me because we used to walk thr
ough this, sometimes 
a little town and we 
would have the 
Hitlerjugend
 out there with rock
s. They™re throwing
 the rocks at us 
and spitting at us and calling us all kind of
 names. So I am sure that they were 
aware of it, maybe they didn™t want to
 tell us that. But then we marched 
[indecipherable]
 food got scarce some -- again at -- when we were marching 
because they  didn™t have the supplies. Li
ke you have an  army, you have the -- the 
supplies come with them, we didn™t have 
that. We had to -- we had to wait until we 
came to a f arm. And if the farmer was ni
ce -- nice enough to give us some raw 
potatoes, then tha-that™s all you can get.
 You will not -- you will not get bread. 
You™ll get a raw potato, you™ll get a turnip
 or something like th
at. Which helped. If 
he was nice, but sometimes we went throu
gh farms they wouldn't give us anything, 
just stayed over overn ight and co ntinued. 
Q: What happened to  t
hose who couldn™t go on? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
60
A: Well, the ones they couldn™t go on, we
 -- we all know what
 happened. They fell 
and they -- they -- they shot 
them. They shot them right 
on the spot. And then they 
mu st have had some other people marching 
in the front of us because sometimes we 
were then -- would run across bodies that we
re laying in the ditches with the striped 
uniforms on. So we n -- we were already aw
are of what happened to them. And you 
could see always their eyes open, the sku 
-- front skull was always out, because they 
had these certain bullets, the -- th e -- from th
e guns that they was using that if you 
got hit in the back of the 
head, the whole front of th
e skull would go out. And we 
knew that that™s -- the man didn™t die th
 -- on his own, but he was shot. And we 

marched and marched un-until we were lib
erated. It was somewhere in -- in 
Bavaria
 where we were liberated. And one mo
rning -- we stayed there overn ight 
and we were in a circle. We™re staying 
in the woods and wa -- I remember eatin g 
berries and the next morning you got up 
and I was looking for berries. They might 
have been green from -- the blueberries ye
t, I knew what they 
looked like, I ca -- I 
remember that, but I was eating 
[indeciphera ble]
. They had a little creek coming 
through here and I rememb er drinking water 
out of that creek. And then I heard low 
flying planes coming through, a lot of 
commo tion. And then we™re seeing trucks 
come in. We weren™t that d
eep into the woods where we
 could see the road. We™d 
see a lot of trucks, tanks, but we didn™t 
know who they  belong
ed to, whether they 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
61
were Germans, or Russian, or American, 
we didn™t know who they were. As we 
were sitting around a circle, a big tank came
 along and knocked all the underbrush 
and some trees down to get to us. And we 
thought they were wh
at -- they going to 
kill us here, probably. And then lo and be
hold this one jumped
 out, a boy jumped 
out, blonde hair, short 
[indecipherable]
 hardly have an y hair, in Polish he says, 
hey, you are free. But before that, to back 
up here just a few seconds, before that we 
were -- while we were sitting, after all th is co mmotion we heard, we saw the -- th-
the guards disappearing. They left us
 sitting by ourselves and they just 
[indecipherable]
 they had at least four of th
em with the four dogs, they 
disappeared. So we, a-as a -- as already expe
rienced in trying to escape and got hurt, 
I told them, better stay put, 
because it might be a trick. 
S o  they listened and we all 
stayed there. By that time, after we di
dn™t see them, and this tank came along, and 
then we saw we were free by that time. Oh, 
was that -- that was a feeling that™s just 
hard to describe, what that 
means. We were hugging that 
guy, kissing that guy, we 
didn™t know what to do with
 him. But then he 
jumped back up on
 the -- on th e tank, 
I remember this time, to throw at us so
me rations. And I reme
mb er the -- the block 
of candy that they had. That was hardly 
[indecipherable]
 we were fighting like cats 
and dogs to get it. So he 
saw he™s not going to  win here
. So he stopped. He says, 
follow me behind th e tank and we™ll get you 
across to a -- to a farmer house. And 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

62
your friends already there liberated, a lot of
 them. So when we 
went across the road 
with him, walked behind the tank. We cam
e in and th en the guy had mixed up so me 
-- I™ll never forget the front of the door, 
next to the entrance, mixed up some big 
trays of whatever -- whatever
 they used, with 
potato peelings and white powder 
mixed up, some kind of ca -- 
stuff. So it mu st have been 
for the animals, I suppose. 
And we didn™t get it -- we didn™t -- couldn
™t wait to go into -- inside the door, we 
didn™t know what they going 
to give us there. So of 
course everybody was fighting 
over this, until the farmer came o u tside yelli
ng at us, don™t eat this, this is for the 
pigs and the -- don™t eat this. And he was take
 us away, and he told
 us to go inside 
the house. Once we came in the house we 
saw a big table, people were sitting, 
laying on the floor, some of them already 
sick from overeating. And some of them 
were eating bread that I -- first time I saw 
a big chunk of bread like this, in my  life, 
you know, for five years. A
nd I started eating too. I got 
a little bit sick too from it. 
And then the medics came in, that™s the medics when -- when
 they healed my 
wound on th e head. I to ld him about it and 
he shaved it and he put a bandage on it, 
medicine on it. I don™t reme mb er if he gave
 me some pills to take, that I can™t 
remember. But I know he gave me some p
ills to take for my stomach, cause we 
were sick, all of us were sick. He says
, don™t overeat, just go slowly. Don™t -- don™t 
-- don™t do too much. But we were -- water 
[indeciphera ble]
 stop drinking for that

day. It™s hard to describe a day like this
, you know, it™s -- for 
the lifetime. And we 
were liberated and that was it.  
Q: At liberation, were you with
 anybody still from your hometown? 
A: Yes, I was with my -- quite a few fro
m my hometown, my friends. We sort of 
decide to stick togeth er, one another, help
 one -- we said, if one gets weak while 

you™re marching, let™s help him, put hi
m under the arms  an-and -- because if you 

didn™t, if you get left toward s the end wh
en  everybody walks and you get stopped, 
and you keep walking away
 from him, they kill him on the other end. And I do 
remember then, three nights before 
we were liberated, and it was near 
Neuenburg 
[indecipherable]
 that was in baria -- in 
Bavaria
. He chopped away  a few people 
from our group, I don™t know 
how many, and he told th em to go the other direction 
into the wooded area. And as we were ma
rching away  from there a mile or two we 

heard lot of gunshots going.
 And they killed them. Three 
nights before, they just 
killed them over there. And somehow, I d
on™t know whether th
ey had -- they had 
the grave ready fo r them or not, but wh en
 we came back -- because that was the 
nearest little town for us to come back to, 
Neuenburg [indeciphera ble]
. When we 
came back we were told that
 they -- the army  discovered 
the freshly dug grave, and 
they didn™t know who that -- what it was.
 So this captain, I remember he had two 
little bars o n  the top of his shoulder, I th
ink he was a captain, I can™t remember his

name. And he says he gave 
orders that Sunday after liberation, the non-Jews -- that 
the Gentiles are going to church
, they cannot go to church th
at day. And then he had 
all the carpenters build boxes, coffins. And th
ey came over there and they had to dig 
out the grave, that was hardly covered. 
The Germans, they ha
d to take the -- the 
Germans had to go down th ere and they ta
ke the bodies -- we -- were seeing -- we 
see -- that™s where we saw that this -- th
ese p eople belonged to
 our group, that we 
lost three nights before we were liberat ed. And I remember 
seeing the soldiers, 
American soldiers crying, they were -- 
tears came out of there. And usually a 
soldier is harder, th-they™re 
tough. But they were saying
 how these people got killed 
and shot in the head. It was just inhumane.
 And th ey made these people put them in 
boxes and they put them on a truck and they
 took them to a re
gular cemetery there 
in -- near 
Neuenburg [indecipherable]
 and they put them in
 the cemetery, all in 
one grave, but each wa -- each body in a co
ffin, that I do remember. And that was 
just three days, they didn™t -- their luck 
was not there. When I was liberated I did 
see a few of my friends, yes, from my own town, even, that we got -- th-then we 

had a -- from out of town we had a lot of 
that we™ve got -- became friends with. We 
stuck together, a-all til I was separated an-and
 sent to this country  and th ey went to 
England,
 so me of them.

Q: You told me the story a little while 
ago about following behind the tank. How 
many of you were there at that time? 
A: Maybe a hundred. That™s ab
out it, I think. Maybe less.  
Q: And do you know what
 part of the American army liberated you? 
A: No, I don™t know, but I k
now this -- this young man sp
oke Po lish, so his parents 
were from 
Poland
. He was not Jewish, he was not a Jew, he was Gentile. But his 
parents came to the 
United States
 from 
Poland
 years ago, and he was born in  
America
, but he could still speak a few words. 
Q: I™m going to pause and ch ange tape. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: -- right, now that you™re liberated. 

A: What means free, you don™t have a guard  
near you, you™re free to roam around 

wherever you want to. It is
 a good feeling, the best feelin g in your life. The worst 
feeling is when they  take your freedom aw
ay from you, this is the worst. And I can 
tell the difference, and the difference makes 
a lot if you™re free. It was unbelievable, 
unbelievable. You -- you th ought the he
aven s opened up and the Messiah came  
down  here. The freedom, it was unbelievable to  -- t-to see that happen, at the time. 

Q: What did you look like 
when you were liberated? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
66
A: I was a little -- skinny, little -- little 
boy. Bones. You could -- you could co unt 
every rib in my body. I must have we
ighed maybe 75 pounds
 probably. That™s 
exactly what they -- this is
 the way I was fed. I know I was very thin, and weak.  
Q: Were you at this height, your full height? 
A: No, I was not in my full height, I starte
d growing a little bit, I thought, after that 
because I didn™t have any food, so I don™
t think the food -- the gr -- the growth 
didn™t come in til I started eating normal food again.  
Q: You mentioned that you had someone from the 
U.S.
 Army  treat your head  
wound. Did you see how other freed
 prisoners were being treated? 
A: They -- everybody was treat
ed really, really nice by th
e American soldiers, they 
were very, very nice. And th
ey treated us royally, really. They took good care of us. 
They were watching us to see we don™t ov
ereat, and the ones that were overeating, 
they gave us medicine to take. And 
they really took good care of us. 
Q: Did you witness any acts of retaliation 
or retribution against former guards or 
collaborators? 
A: I be -- leaving 
Flossenbürg
 -- when we left 
Flossenbürg
, we had this one guy in  
Flossenbürg
 that every mo rning we would ge
t a speech. He -- he™s -- he™d 
[indecipherable]
 pounding. He would sa
y, don™t get excited over this, he says, 
you™ll never make it out of here. He says, I™l
l make sure of that, before you get out,

that you™ll all be dead. In the meantime, 
after we got liberated, we came out of 
there, we saw that man on th -- in -- 
somewhere in the tr
enches laying dead. 
Somebody killed him, I don™t know who. No
w who this man was, I don™t know. He 
was the 
blockalteste
 they call him, in charge of the barrack, whoever he was.  
Q: After liberation, what was th
e first thing you chose to do? 
A: The first thing I chose to 
do is food, was my number one 
prorio ty . 
And th en --
then I was trying to get myself togethe
r, started to think about my family right 
away. So I said, where are these people,
 I don™t -- I knew I had a sister in 
America
, 
I didn™t know where she lives. I knew I had it,
 so with every soldier I saw I told him 
I have a sister in 
America
, and I thought it was
 New York
, the ba -- th-the capital 
of 
America
 is
 
in 
New York
, I didn't know. I didn™t know it was 
Washington
, and 
then -- til I met my brother a
nd he happened to have the 
-- the address and he wrote 
to my sister in the 
States
 -- 
United States
, and sh e sent papers for us. 
Q: Which brother? 
A: 
Za c h a r y
. 
Q: After liberation, where did you live? 
A: After the liberation we lived in -- 
I lived in different places. I was in 
Neuenburg 
[indecipherable]
 first, and then we moved to 
Ze ilitzheim
, near
 Frankfurt
. There 
was a 
DP
, displaced person camp, and I remember the 
UNRRA
, run by
 UNRRA

503, 
I reme mb er the number, I still got a picture of it, too. And th ere we came back 
like to civilization. We came in there and 
there were beds for each one of us with  a 
mattress, w ith a pillow, w
ith a cover. We had a kitchen. Whether it was kosher, I 
don™t know, but we did have 
a kitchen and we had lots of
 -- we had plenty of fo od 
to eat in that -- in that displaced person 
camp. And then we were scrounging around 
for clothes, started dress, you know, nice
ly. And we were able to do that, and 
waiting to get to this country.
 And also, I was also -- befo
re I came to this country I 
wound up work ing with the Amer
ican soldiers. They chose 
six of us. They to ok us 
in to work for them
. Our job was to hand the food ou
t to the soldie
rs. So we had 
been -- we had a -- a check 
on th e fingernails and the ha
nds every mo rning before 
we handed  the food out. We didn't wear 
gloves, but he made sure that our hands 
were washed clearly -- clean and -- and we
 handed out all the fo
od to the soldiers. 
So we got along fine. We -- 
we lived with the 
soldiers within th
e compound and we 
-- we were one of theirs. So I hated to se
parate them, but -- you know, but I had to 
leave for this country , I had to come meet 
my sister. But they treated us real nice. 
Q: How did you reconnect with your -- with
 your brother and th
e other family and 
friends? 

A: Well, this one brother who 
was in the Polish army, was 
Za c h a r y
, I heard -- one 
of my cousins, the one that
 helped me the bleeding 
in the camp, 
she survived, 
Ida.
 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

69
And 
Ida
 found out that her brother is liberated
 somehow. And he is in a cor -- in a 
place called 
Ló dz
. I am not sure, but I think it was
 Lódz. 
And before she left, I 
happened  to  visit her in 
Bergen-Belsen
. She -- she survived in 
Bergen-Belsen
, so I 
went to visit her there, and we were ta
lking, she said she™
s going to go to 
Ló dz
, go 
see where her brother is. So I said, while 
you™re going there, I said, maybe you™ll 
run in to brother. And sure enough when  she 
talked to her brother, her brother said 
that my  brother has also arrived there. And 
they got in touch, so my  brother sent a 
note with  her saying that I should come to vi
sit him. And I was a little bit scared to 
be anywhere except being with the 
U.S.
 Army. I was safe with them, and I felt that I 
shouldn™t go no place. And we
 got back to him and told 
him, wrote him a li -- a note 
saying th at he -- if he wants to see me he has to come to 
Ze ilitzheim
, near
 
Frankfurt
, and I™ll be there. And he decided, 
and he did come. When  he came we 
got hooked up together. And we still di
dn™t know what happe
ned to the older 
brother until we found out, after we
 wrote to my sister in the 
United States
, she told 
us that
 Dave
, the oldest is in 
America
 too, already living with her. He came in 1941 
to this country
, through -- from 
Lithuania
 through 
Japan
, from 
Japan
 to the 
United States
. He came just before 
Pearl Harbor
, by maybe a month or so. And so 
he was -- he yel -- he escaped all the puni
sh ment from all the concentration camps. 
He was the lucky one, I think. 
So  we all wound up here in 
America
 with my sister,

three guys living with my sist
er. She took us in
, all three of us. She fixed up her -- 
her attic with hardwood floors
, beautiful up there. We really had a nice place to live 
up there. She fed us well. My sister 
Diana
. And she treated us royally, really, like 
she would be our mo ther.  
Q: After the war, did you list 
yourself among the surviv ors? 

A: List? 

Q: Did you give your name to be listed 
among the surv ivors for people who were 
searching fo r you? 
A: Yes, oh sure, I gave -- we 
gave them names all the time 
[indecipherable] 
names, 
we were looking fo r people, always s
earching, searching, all the time. 
Q: Did you ever go back
 to your pre-war home? 
A: No, because I had a bad taste over th
ere and I said I wo
uld never go back 
because my -- I could only sp
e -- I cannot speak for all
 Poland
, I™m sure there must 
have been some kind Po lish people, but 
in my town, no. My 
town, nobody would 
help you, no one would help you. So th
erefore I had a bad taste and I don™t -- I 
don™t intend to go back 
there ever, I don™t think. 
Q: When did you realize the 
full extent of the genocide? 

A: When I -- when I finally got into 
Auschwitz
, that™s w h en I first saw what was 
happening with the piles of bodies layi
ng around there and the stench and the

71
burning. And th en we saw what happened. 
And th en of course I -- I was always 
thinking about my  mo th er and th e other si
sters that were taken away and I didn™t 
know where they were taken away and 
I still was hoping someday that maybe 
they™re alive, but -- but it™s not 
so. They perish ed somewhere. 
Q: You said you were in 
DP
 camp, but were you living with the other prisoners, or 
were you staying with the Americans? 

A: No, in -- in the 
DP
 camp I stay ed with the -- 
with all our people in the 
DP
 camp. 
But after that, when we got -- the six of us 
got jobs with the Amer
ican soldiers, they 
took us out of there and we 
no longer went into that 
DP
 camp, we stay
ed with them 
in the -- in their barracks. In
 fact, there was a building in 
there that we 
stayed with. 
We had our own beds and we stayed with
 them. We even wore
 the unifo rms. We 
didn™t have any insignias, no sn -- no -- 
no anything like that, but we wore the -- 

they gave us the uniforms we were wear
ing and handing out the fo od. We didn™t 
have to wash dishes, we didn™t have to sc
rub floors. So the ge-ge --the German wor 
-- prisoners did have to do th
at, thank God of that. They  
didn™t ask us to do all that. 
But we was really treated real
 good by the Americans, n o
 complaint at all. Too bad 
it didn™t come a little earlier, 
and thank God they came wh
en they came because had 
it been another couple of weeks, I 
don™t think I would 
have survived.  

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

Q: I want to stay in the 
DP
 camp for just a couple of minutes. When you were with 
the other survivors, what ki
nds of things did you talk 
ab out during the days, and 
what did you do? 
A: Well, we talked about our families, wh
ere the families are, and what this one 
can™t find, what he can™t find. And then th
e most al -- our young
 -- young life in the 
camp, especially me, my teens. 12, and 
I didn™t come out til I was 17 or -- 17, I 
think? 12 - five -- 17 years old. And you 
know, I lost all my  youth, and you can™t 
get that back any more. I lo
st my whole -- my education.
 I was not -- they -- they 
depriv ed me of my  education. All I had wa s seventh grade. How much can I learn in 
seven grade? 
[indecipherable]
 I learned in the seventh grade, and they take away  
the pencil and th e paper and the books from 
you, for five years you don™t see it, 
believe you me, I don™t reme mb er a thing. It 
was hard to even think anything that I 
reme mb er from the school, wh ether it was Hebrew or -- or -- or -- or the regular 

school. I couldn™t remember too much at 
all about that, because as I say, I was 
depriv ed of all that. And that™s what we
™re talking about. Then we were talking 
about families where you have
 -- everybody was jealous of me that I had a sister 
here in 
America
, and I™ll be -- I™ll -- in fact, I came
 one of the earliest, cause I came 
here 1946 when  I came to this country , on
e of the second boats, I think, that it -- 
with the -- the displaced persons.  

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

Q: Were there any opportunities for you to get any education in the 
DP
 camp? 
A: Noth ing, the 
DP
 camps, I mean we -- we had so
me education going on, but th -- 
I didn™t feel like -- I was 
not in the mood to  learn anything there about -- I was 
thinking about coming to this country. An
d when  I came to this country , yeah, my  
sister was always telling me I should go to
 school, and I went to
 night school here, 
learned the language a little. I learned a lo
t from the soldiers, but you know, you 
learn their language sometimes from soldie
rs. But when I came
 here, my sister 
would go to the movies with me, she would 
[indeciphera ble]
 me so meti mes to  see 
two pictures at the same time, you know, 
one after the other. And that™s where I 
learned mo st of my  English. 
Q: Still back at the 
DP
 camp. After the war, did you no
tice any different religious or 
moral standards among the Jews? 
A: Not really. I didn™t see anything lik
e that, not where I was, I don™t know, it 
probably  did exist, ma ybe, but I am not aware of. 
Q: Do you remember how 
long you were in the
 DP
 camp? 
A: Not too long, I mean, I -- when
 I came here ju -- June the 18
th
 of 1946 I came 
here and I was liberated in April, so a few months.  

Q: And how long we
re you living with the Americans? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
74
A: Ah, maybe a month or two, maybe. So me
thing like that, because they had to be 
shipped out again, but it was really
 nice to stay with those guys. 
Q: Tell me about coming to 
America
 and your first impressions. 
A: Oh, the first impression when we arrived 
here and I saw all those cars going over 
the bridges from the boat, and I said, how do th ey 
[indecipherable]
 right along, 
with these cars don™t hitting each other? Up
 and down, sideways, they were going 
everywhere, every direction.
 And until -- I didn™t see much from -- after I got off, 
but then  my  brother, the oldest, met me, 
David
, he met me at the -- at the -- at the -- 
where we got off from the boat. And he took 
us into the city. An
d then when  I saw, 

I couldn™t get over it, how tall those buildings
 are. We looked like 
real flies t -- t-to 
see the buildings like that, so big and ta
ll and so many. There™s so many beautiful 
things in this country , although -- I mean, 
Germany
 had it -- some of it too, but I 
mean, I didn™t really see mu
ch over there. But the 
United States
 there was -- 
especially in 
New York
, it was so pretty, it was so beau
tiful, I couldn™t get over it. I 
really liked everything that 
I saw. My brother took me over to see my  aunt. He says, 

come on. My -- my  uncle already passed aw
ay. He says, while we here, let -- I™ll 

take you over -- sh-she lives in 
Brooklyn
 somewhere, I™m not sure where it was, 
and he took us over there. 
And na -- she was all right, she didn™t give me such a 
good greetings like she™s supposed to. But she was busy co oking, I guess I™ll 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
75
forgive her. She was pretty 
nice. But she didn™t ask t
oo many questions. People -- a 
lot of people didn™t want to ask too many questions in th
ose days. First I didn™t beli 
-- they didn™t think something like that ca
n happen and you still be
 alive. And there 
was just a lot of silence going on. And 
when I came here, my
 sister, yeah, she 
wanted to  know everything wh at happened to
 the rest of the family, and I explained. 
I had to meet my brother-in-law in -- in -- in -- I think it was in 
Coney
 
Island
 he 
had -- that I met him,  and th en he took 
me back to his place where he was in 
Brooklyn
. He had a -- a shoe factory, ladies™ s
hoes. And he said he did not get mar 
-- he™s waiting for 
[indecipherable]
 to say you tell me, is my sister dead? And I 
said, yes, I™m the witness, I saw her, we we
re trying to escape, she got shot, she is 
dead. He said, now he is going
 to go on with his life . 
He was waiting all these years 
for her, hopefully that she would come do
wn here and she didn't make it. And he 
was so -- and so  -- what would be the right
 wo rd? Kind, or not -- I don™t know right 
word to say, he was waiting for her. He di
dn't want to get married until he heard 
from me th at she is -- that she is dead. 
And then he -- after a 
few months later he 
met somebody, he married and got a life of his own then . 
Q: And his name? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
76
A: His name was
 Osher, Haskell Osher. 
In Polish -- in 
Poland
 it was 
Osha 
Lovitz,
 but when  he came to this country he changed it to 
Osher, O-s-h-e-r, 
I 
think. 
Q: After you came to this country, how 
were you able to 
support yourself?  
A: Well, my sister supported me for awh
ile. And then , I didn™t want too mu ch 
handout. I was already 18 years old, I got 
to be able to do so mething. And being I 
was familiar with metal and 
I worked in the factories, 
I -- my first job was with 
Kugart
 and 
Dubb
. And that -- they were -- th
is comp any was making ch eckout 
counters for all the grocery stores, for those giant 
Safeway™s
 and my  job was to 
work with the steel 
[in d ecipherable]
 long time. 
[indecipherable]
 to -- to cover the 
metal -- to cover the wood wi
th metal. And I was workin
g for them for awhile. And 
after that, o f course, I met my wife. So I me
t my wife in the -- a
nd my future father-
in-law told me, this is not a job for a 
Jewish boy. Sh eet metal work. He says, you 
come and work for me in the 
clothing store. So I got a j
ob with him. And after that I 
still wanted to be on my own, I didn™t -- 
I didn™t like it. So after we got married, 
with -- I got -- took a job with a department 
store, my  -- my  sister knew this guy in 
the
 Landsberg™s
 department store, that™s before 
you, I think, I don™t think you will 
remember that. It was a nice department stor
e here. And he gave me a job, his name 
was 
Eric Rapp, R-a-p-p, Eric
, he still sees me all the 
time, says, I gaveyou the 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

77
first job in 
America
, I said, you™re right. And he gave 
me a job and he told  me to be 
stock boy, because of the language. I couldn
™t speak too -- I was speaking English, 
but not that good. But th
en I worked for about three, four months in 
Landsberg™s
, a 
stock boy, he told me one day, 
Henry , 
I want you to put on a suit and a tie and nice 
clean shined shoes and come on in. And I did,
 and he put me on the floor to sell. So 
I was tell him, I said, Mr.
 Rapp
, I can sell, b u t how do 
I get the names from the 
people? I don™t know how to 
spell the names. And I still 
remember it, the words he 
told me, he says, in this 
country you don™t have to wo
rry about it. Ask you how you 
spell your name. Even if it™s a 
Smith
, you say, how do you 
sp ell it? And so goes 
with the same with the address, and pe
ople will tell you how to  spell it. So that 
shouldn™t be a problem. So I got in, I wa
s doing good, I was working there for six 
years after that. 
Q: You didn™t tell me  
how you met your wife. 
A: Oh, okay. I met my wife with my sist
er, when I was living 
still with my sister. 
She had friends in 
Baltimore,
 so she was always traveling to
 Baltim ore
 in 
weekends. So I went along with
 her, me and my  other brother
 Za chary, 
we went 
there with her. And this older gentleman wh
o was in the house that she was visiting, 
he was visiting too. And he says to me
, oh you™re such a handsome guy, he said, 
come over, we don™t need to stay with thes
e people here -- he was driving -- he said,

I™ll take you down  here to this 
-- something going on, people from
 Washin gton
 
came here, like the women™s Zionist organi
zation, into  a synagogue and I™ll take 
you down, maybe you™ll me et
 somebody nice. He took 
me, I think by my self or 
with 
Za chary,
 I™m not sure. But all I know, we we
nt there and the people that came 
from 
Washington 
had 
[indecipherable]
 with her. And we l -- I looked at her, she 
looked at me, we sort of eyed each other 
and we started ex -- talking. He came over, 
the old man came over. He says 
Henry
, come on, I™ll -- I™ll introduce you to a nice 
girl. I says, you don™t know that girl, how
 can -- he says, don™t worry about it, I™ll 
go over there. He talked to 
the father and mother, he sa

A: Their names, 
Norman

 Bernard

 Stanley

Gail. 
Q: How did you choose their names? 
A: My wife chose the names. She was -- 
she was choose them 
wi -- chosen -- it™s 
not choosing the names, we name d them after our parents.
 Norman
, he™s named 
after my father, 
Nuchem
. 
Bernard 
is a -- is named after part of my sister
 Brundl
, 
cause her -- the 
B
 will be in there. 
Stanley, 
I think is named after an uncle, I think. 
But my -- my daughter, she is
 named after my mother, 
Gittel
. And it so happened 
that she was born -- I lost
 my  mo th er on  th e 2 7
th
 of October, 1942, 
and my  daughter 
is born on -- on October the 27
th
, what does that mean? October the 27
th
 she was 
born. And sh e is -- she is named after my  mo ther. 
Q: What did you tell your ch
ildren about your childhood? 
A: Well, not for awhile, when they were 
young I didn™t tell them, but later on, as 
they got older I told them all what happ
ened . And they  couldn™t believe something 
like this would happen, that one human bei
ng could do that to 
another human being. 
And they  couldn™t get over it, but yet -- 
they did -- kept asking questions. My 
number -- for awhile I would tell them th
at™s my phone numb
er. I wouldn™t tell 
them, I didn™t want to tell them. Until the pi
cture came out. It was in 1978, I think it 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

came out. It was called  the h -- it was called, ﬁ
Holoca ust,ﬂ 
and it played for four 
days, was like a documentary. 
Q: On television. 
A: On television, of course. And then they
 sat with me and we watched it. And then 
when the questions and answer
s opened up, that™s
 when they were 
really into it and 
then they were 
[indecipherable]
 or not, they didn™t believe, how could you ever 
survive all this? My God, how could you ev er survive this? And 
I told them, it was 

even worse than that. They di
 -- they didn™t put everything in th at picture, because 
people wo uldn't have watch it. They had to
 -- so it wouldn™t be 
so horrified like -- 
like it was. We had th e -- we had a mu ch, mu
ch more problems th
an what they  saw 
in the picture. And that™s when they
 -- I told them all what happened.  
Q: I™d like to -- to go back and talk a 
little bit about the history of what was going 
on in this country 
when you came. Let™
s start with the 
Nuremberg
 trials. Do you 
remember followi
ng them -- 
A: I followed it a little bit,
 yes, I followed it, yeah. 

Q: How was it reported here? 

A: Well that -- there was newspaper, a
nd I think we saw some -- I think on 
television, I think, some parts, I think 
years ago, or later on maybe, I saw it on 
TV
, 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

part of it, but mo stly in the paper. Like
 I say a -- everybody was denying, because 
somebody else says th at it wasn™t 
their fault, they took orders.  
Q: Did you feel justice was done at
 Nuremberg
? 
A: Well yes, yeah, justice was done, they sh
ould have killed ever
y one of them, na -
- nobody should have gone out
 of there alive. They  should have punished every one 
of them, cause they knew what happened, 
they knew what they
 were doing. They -- 
this escape goat that they to
ok orders is -- is not -- no 
such a thing. They were 
educated people. The-These men -- these me
n were not primitive, they -- they were 
educated, th ey had co llege degrees, they
 were professors. They were very well 
educated people. How does an
 educated person let himself get away to kill other 
people? An-
Annha lia te
 a whole nation, how do you do 
that? A whole race, rather. 
How -- how di-did  you let yourself do all 
this? Whether th-the order is right or 
wrong, you should be able 
to tell whether you do the ri
ght thing or not. And you did 
it, so don™t try to escape now. 
Q: You were also in this country  during the 
U.N.
 partition of 
Palestine
. Did you 
follow th-the debates and -- and the pa
rtition vote and the actual independence? 
A: Yes, I did, and I was hoping that™s
 what would happen and I hoped to God 
Israel 
wouldn™t had a -- wish 
Israel
 would have had a country  five years before that, 
maybe wo uldn't have had all this problem. 
Somebody would have been out there to 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
82
speak up for us, somebody would have opene
d their arms and gates to let us in. 
Instead, where we were, we couldn™t -- 
there was no way, we couldn™t travel, 
nobody wanted us. We were -- we -- we we
re -- like everybody had a deaf ear, they 
didn™t hear wa -- no matter what th
ey did to us, nobody believed it 
[indecipherable]
. But in -- in -- in 
this country here -- 
Q: Is there anything else that you wanted 
to  say about the -- did you ever consid er 
going to 
Palestine
 or to 
Israel
? 
A: We were -- I was listening on the ra
dio with the partition, I remember 
[indecipherable]
 it was going on, the votes that were taking, and thank God of Mr. 
what™s his name? President 
Truman
, if it wouldn™t for him, I don™t think we would 
have had an  
Israel
. He was the only, kindest president we had. 
Roosevelt
 
supposingly 
supposed to have been  good to  th
e Jews, but I found out later, I 
understand that he was not that good to  ou
r Jewish people, that he did not help 
much, especially with the -- 
with the letting people into 
this country. The -- the -- 
what do you call those, the la
w, what do you call that law? 
Q: Oh, th ey had quotas for immigration -- 
A: The quotas, when we i
mmig r ate, y eah , immi -- to  i mmig r ate p eo p le to  th is 
country. I mean, we are good people, we we
re hard wo rk ing people. He could have 
left us in here, we would have prosper he
re. Our children did g
ood. We -- we took -- 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
83
we show -- we showed 
America
 that we came here not for a handout. We came 
here, raised children, professionals, to ma
ke a good living. They  are hard wo rk ing 
people. We didn™t cause
 anybody no problems. 
Q: What do your children do for a living? 
A: My children do for a living, I got -- 
two boys are dentists, my  daughter is 
secretary, my eldest son us
ed to work in bus
iness with me as 
a businessman. So 
everybody had some -- did something, th
ere was nobody was 
waiting fo r a handout 
from nobody. So if -- if 
Roosevelt 
would have let us in right in th e beginning, we 
would have been an asset to
 this country, I think. 
Q: Tell me what was going on in your lif
e, now in  the 1950™s, as you were having 
your family and -- and your -- your career was beginning. 

A: Well, in 1950 I started to, you know, 
get my family, I™m ma
rried and I haveone 
son, trying to get a job, the job worked, an
d I wanted something else. So I went into 
a dry cleaning business. Worked  with my  br
other in the dry cleaning busin ess. Then 
I bought my  brother out of the business a
nd I went by my self, me and my  son was 
running it. It was hard work, every day, 
12 hours a day, work
ing every day, busy 
work ing, trying to do -- make a living. A
nd I thought I made a nice living here, I did 
okay. And everybody™s fine.  

Q: The 
Eichmann
 trial, did you follow it? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
84
A: I followed that in 
Israel
, yeah, I followed how they 
caught him, the Israeli, 
they™re geniuses if they ever found that
 man. And how they got him out of that 
country, too. They -- they something are, 
they are the best in 
the world. They got 
him, th-they did the right thing, punish  hi
m. Whatever th ey did to him, he deserve 
it. They just set a e -- too easy of a death.  They ought to put hi
m in a cage and keep 
him in a cage and -- and send him over the 
world, and keep him in the cage and see 
what he did to human beings
. This was too easy for him, to kill him that way they 
killed him in
 Israel, 
hanging him. Was too easy for him.  
Q: How was that trial presented to the Am
erican people, and do you rememb er what 
the American reaction was? 
A: The American -- I can™t remember what 
happened, but I know there was fors and 
againsts. People thought maybe they shoul
dn™t have got him out of there the way 
they did, with the laws and all. But this
 was a -- a murderer, he was killing millions 
of people, and experimenting on -- on ch ildre
n, I mean, he -- he deserved what he 
got. 

Q: During your time in this co
untry, this country went through some pretty dramatic 
changes. You saw th e Civil Rights moveme
nt and you saw the sexual revolution. 
What stands out in your mind about the -- 
the 60™s and the 70™s in terms of soci al 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
85
change? Did anything -- was anyt
hing particularly of interest or special meaning for 
you? 
A: Well, wa -- when I came to this count
ry  though, we had the segregation here. 
Well, that made me feel a little bit uncom
fortable. I said, they are human beings, 
why don™t they have -- why can™t they go 
to drink water at the 
same fountain that 
we drink? What™s the difference, we -- if
 you™re going to war, you fight with the 
guys, soldiers, black or white fight togethe
r. Why shouldn™t they be able to go into 
the same bathroom, for inst
ance as we -- as th e whites go on the same water -- or 
live in the same area? That 
made me a little bit uncomfo
rtable, I was happy to see 
what had happened with 
Martin Luther King, 
he spoke up for them, he one of the 
greatest spokesp eople in the wo rld, I think 
is, the way he carried himself through. 

Sorry that he had to be killed. And he di
d a lot for the black po
pulation, the black -- 
black people. And also, I didn™t -- I was unc
omfortable coming to  this country  and I 
reme mb er driving along on 
Massachusetts
 Avenue in  my  brother-in-law™s car and I 
remember seeing a sign on 
Massachusetts 
Avenue
 
would say, this area is 
restricted. And I would ask my  brother-in-
law, what does it mean restricted? He 
says, that means no Jews or no blacks can
 live in this area. Now, I was very 
uncomfortable with that. A
nd th en driving thro ugh the Wh ite House one time and I 
saw the skinheads with thei
r swastikas in front of the Wh ite House. I could not

comp rehend that either in this country , bu
t I wasn™t aware yet that this Freedom of 
Speech business is, I was not aware of it. 
I -- now I know why the reason they let 
them do it. 
Q: We went through some 
wars in this country, 
Korea, Vietnam
 and there were 
many conflicts with the 
Soviet Union
. Did you have any pers
onal reflections or 
thoughts on that? 
A: Not really, I mean, that
™s th-the -- the -- the -- 
Vietnam
, the war was -- that was 
an uncomfortable war, lot of young pe
ople got killed for no reason. But -- you 
know, and all that, but still the 
United States
 speaks out now, th
ey speak out for the 
world now. They don™t let th
ings get away out of hand 
any more like they used to. 
They  shove it under the table like it not exis
ted. No w if something breaks out and 
you wonder o-or -- or the other countries
 where -- no matter where it happens, 
people speak out. In those days wh en we
 were suffering and we
 were getting killed 
an -- and burnt and -- a-and -- and everything, nobody would ev er take up fo r us. 
You didn™t hear anything. 
Why didn™t all these people speak out in those days, 
maybe they would have been saved, a lot of
 people, if they would have spoke out at 
that time. 
Q: I™m going to pause to change tape.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Henry Greenbaum.
 This is tape number three, 
side
 A. 
Have you ex perienced anti-Se
mitism in this country? 
A: When I first came h ere, yes, I d id. I was 
driving along in the st
r -- in the roads, I 
seen, I guess 
[indecipherable]
 I think that this -- this is
 restricted and no Jews can 
go here. Some -- I understand 
some department stores wo
uldn™t hire Jews. I don™t 
reme mb er the name of the department, I think it was 
Garfinkel
 when I came here to 
this country, I think. I think it was 
Garfinkel
 that said there was no Jews hired in 
this place. And I mean, you co
uld see it, even when I wa
s in business I could see -- 
detect a little bit anti-
Semism
 -- anti-Semitism, but that™s not much, that™s not 
much. It was not like it was on -- in 
Euro pe
, definitely not.  
Q: Tell me about the wo
rk that you do at 
the Holocaust museum. 
A: I™m a volunteer, and I -- I™m a v o lunteer
 for the mu seum, I go out on sp eaking -- 
they ask me to go out to talk
 to schools, or churches, or some organizations that 
want to hear a Holocaust survivor, I do go
 out to speak. Or so
metimes within the 
build ing a group comes and they want to have
 a survivor to spea
k to them, and they 
ask me to, I do it. And tho -- that™s
 the way I do my volunteer work. 
Q: How often are you down  there? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
88
A: Well, I™m down there every week on Friday
s, I™m -- then I ca -- except for either 
other meetings that they  have or other f
unctions when  they have, I do get invited, I 
go down there. No matter what 
they ask me to do, I do it.  
Q: Do you have any other dutie
s or responsibilities on Fridays? 
A: I™m home, I g -- I™m sitting at the desk 
on Friday and the -- th
e donors™ desk and 
-- and membership desk, that™s one desk an
d we see people come up and -- and they 
wan t  to  b eco me memb ers o f  
the Holocaust mu seum and I 
talk to them. They do ask 
me all questions and I™m -- if I™m a surviv
or, I do tell them that that™s what I™m 
doing. And some people are very gener
ous, they come up to
 donate a little bit 
money so metimes. And we do a good jo
b over there overall. We™re like the 
ambassador or the goodwill at that desk. 
Q: What do you bring to  your volunteer wo
rk that is special and rewarding for you 

and fo r the people you meet? 

A: Well, I guess my experience in th -- in 
th -- in the -- in the 
camp s that I had and 
through all that ti -- bad time that we had, 
I guess I do talk about it to people if they 
have some questions they want to ask, 
I do tell them well, what I saw and what I 
think. 
Q: What is your reaction to this resurgen
ce of interest, this 
new interest in the 
Holocaust? 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
89
A: Well, we don™t know wh at happens. 
All of a sudden everybody wants to know 
about the Holocaust. It™s so many years be
fore, I wish they would ask all these 
questions 50 some years ago,
 I would have remembered 
a little bit more
 than I can 
remember now, because the mind bottles, y-yo
u can™t remember a lot of things. It™s 
been 50 some years now. In th e beginning no 
one was interested, 
nobody wanted to 
talk about it. They want 
to shove it under the table lik
e nothing happened . How can 
you shove something like this under th
e table? Six million Jewish people and 
children killed, and plus five, 
I think or six others, for othe
r reasons that were killed. 
12 so meth -- 12 million people died. And than
k God the -- that the museum is here, 
because us survivors, how long are we goi
ng to be here? Another 20 years, I -- 
hopefully, and then  -- well, no, you have
 now some professors or book writers 
trying to  write the book saying that the Holo caust never ex isted.
 
But how can they 
say that? We are here. The survivors are s
till here. And once we
 go, then they™ll 
have to lo ok up into  the mu seum, see our
 records, our talks, our speeches, our 
documentaries that we gave. They™ll 
have to pay attention to that. So 
[indecipherable]
 now, what gets me too is, wa -- if
 they don™t believe us survivors, 
why don™t they check 
with the army? The 
U.S.
 Army has -- has lib erated many 
[indecipherable]
 liberated me, an d I know they 
saw what happened to us. So  it 
must -- it had to be a Holo
caust. So these people trying to make a -- a fast dollar, 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999

writing these books that the Holocaust never 
existed -- when I go 
into the museum I 
think I™m in a memorial place. I™m thinki
ng of coming to visit my parents, I™m 
thinking it™s a cemetery here. I have nowh
ere to go to , to see my  mo ther, my  other 
siblings that have passed away, or they™re
 killed, they took 
them and murdered 
them. I go there, I™m th inking I™m like am-a
mongst them. When 
you go up upstairs 
and you see the -- the shoes or th e brush 
-- toothbrushes or the glasses, you lo ok -- 
I™m thinking -- I said, mine might be right 
in there. And I™m always thinking about 
that when I™m upstairs.  

Q: In your opinion, do you think Ameri
can Jews might ever be in danger? 
A: If we let it get out of hand, yes, de
finitely. You al -- you always got to be 
vigilant, you always got to keep  abreast. 
You can™t hide anything. You got to speak 
out, just like we do now, what
 happens in other countrie
s. If we keep that up, I 
would say no, it will never happen again. 

Q: Have you been  to 
Israel
? 
A: I have been to 
Israel
 only once, with the Holo caust 
survivor gatherings we have, 
in 1981, and I love 
Israel
 very much. 

Q: What was that experience like for you? 
A: Well, it was a experience that I was in a Je
wish state, I didn™t 
have to look up in 
the back of my  shoulder and say who is 
following me? You™re free to walk around 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum

91
with your 
Shabbes
. You™re dressed wh atever you™re
 dressed. If you want to walk 
with your 
tallit
 outside, you walk with your 
tallit
 outside. You feel more free than I 
am -- which I love this country  dearly, 
but a little bit more fr
ee there with this 
religious as here.  
Q: 
Israel
 has fought several wars. What were your thoughts during the times that 
Israel
 was at war? 

A: While
 Israel
 was at war I felt bad for them 
because they stood all alone, by 
themselves. And all these hostile countries,
 all of them agai
nst them. And thank 
God th -- only the 
United States
 was helping a little bit, which that helped, 
otherwise they would -- they
 had to do the job on th
eir own, fighting all these 
enemies. A nd it brought me back to -- a 
little bit back to the 
concentration camp. 
We were all alone. Nobody speaks out for 
you. They had -- they 
had to fight their 
own battles, so to speak, the Israelis. Wh
ich they did. And th
ank God they did. 
Thank Go d we have a state now. If someth
ing happens, they™ll be wide open  -- 
they™ll hold their arms open, take
 everybody who wa
nts to come in. 
Q: How has your Holocaust experience infl
uenced the choices that you™ve made in 
your life? 
A: Well, the choices are made that yo
u got to live day by 
day, you know what 
tomorrow will bring. Try to ge
t along with your fellow ma
n. Get along with people. 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
92
Try not discriminate against anybody. Just 
get along, mainly. Live a good life. Keep 
family together, be happy and 
-- and the rest comes by itself. 
Q: Has your view of Judaism changed since the Holo caust? 
A: Well, I was more religious at -- like 
the beginning -- in 
my  ho meto wn  -- wh -
when we were at home, it was very strict. I h ad ma -- I 
[indecipherable]
 I believe 
in God, definitely. I try to
 live the right way. But you do the best you can in a 
country that it™s not all Jews. So you do
 the best you can here. But my  views on 
religion very -- I love -- I -- I love being 
Jewish, I™m a Jew. That™s how I was born, 
I™ll die that way. 
Q: When  you lo ok b
ack on yourself as a parent, wh
at influence did the Ho locaust 
have on th e way you raised your children? 

A: Well, I raised my children -- the first 
thing is education, I did not have the 
education. So I tried, in my house, I was stri
ct rules of what -- you™ve got to study. I 

want them to be educated be
cause I was deprived of this
. So the main goal was the 
education in my house, that was the main
 thing. And then  of course, protect -- 
overp rotective, which the kids say that I was,
 and -- both of us pa
rents, my wife and 
-- and me. But that comes from where I wa
s. I mean, we had to  protect your 
children, so they don™t get in any problems w
ith -- with the law, or
 that they had all 
these problems they had in the 60™s here
. Thank God I didn™t
 have any problem 

 
Interview with Henry Greenbaum  
 
December 20, 1999 
 

 
 
93
with my children. But I was 
vil -- I can™t pronounce the wo
rd  -- vigilant? Vigilant of 
them, to see what they doing,
 where they going, who they
 associate with. And so  far 
they never gave me any trouble, than
k God. I thought I raised them right. 
Q: Are you involved  with any survivor groups? 
A: Yes, we are, we™re survivor 
[indecipherable]
 with the survivors group, we go 
back to 1978, 
when we first 
[indecipherable]
, our organization was Club 
Shalom
. 
And then in ™78 I became the president of
 
Club
 Shalom
. And I been with Club
 
Shalom
 ever since. Now it™s changed to Jewi
sh Ho locaust Surv ivors and Friends of 
Greater 
Washington
. And I™m still a vice president 
now with the organization. And 
we work  very hard in  that organization. 
If we hear something wrong, some injustice 
was done, we always talk about it, we 
bring attention to so mebody about it.  
Q: Have you had any recurri
ng nightmares since the war? 
A: Oh yeah, plenty. Every night I get ni
ghtmares, every night. Just never goes 
away. If you watch a picture the night befo re on th e -- on that particular subject, you 
will dream about it. If I go out to talk duri
ng th e day, to a school, or to chil -- or 
anybody, I will dream in the ni
ghttime about that subject. 
[indecipherable]
 that 
never goes away. At least with me  it doesn™t. I dream about the trains, I dream 

about the marches, I dream about the -- wa
tching the hangings an
d all this kind of 
stuff.

Q: When  you lo ok back on
 your life in this country , wh at has been your best 
surprise about 
America
? 
A: My best surprise is fre
edom here. You™re free, you
™re free to do whatever you 
want. The -- the -- it™s open for you. It™s ju
st your ability. What 
you want to do if 
you -- it™s up to you. You can go as far as
 you want, no one stops you. And th at™s 
what I like about this countr
y. Nobody tells you what to
 do. You want to beco me 
rich, you want to become poor, you do wh at
™s -- it™s up in your hands. Whatever 
you do with your life, it™s 
you. You got to do it. 
Q: Have you had any 
big disappointments in this country? 
A: You mean with myself, big disappoint
ment? Oh but -- you mean in general of 
this country? No , no. I just had a disapp
ointment when I first came here and saw 
this -- these signs, these ridiculous signs a
nd they said restricted. That bothered me 
a little bit, but I got over that. 

Q: What™s next in store for you? 
A: For me? To have a nice retired life, c
ontinue doing wh at I™m doing, speak out on 
the subject. As long as I live I will always 
talk about the Holocaust and tell -- this is 
the reason perhap s that God has saved me, to
 stay alive so I can keep talking, tell 

the world of the children or to different pe
ople to see what they
 did to our Jewish 
race, what they did to us, 
the families and I j -- I feel
 the whole Jewish race.

Q: What would you like your family and y
our friends, or people who in the future 
will listen to this tape, what would yo
u like them to know about you or your 
experiences that they 
may not already know? 
A: Well, they know the experience already,
 but they -- I think 
they sh ould keep it 
up. They  should definitely ke
ep wide open, they
 should carry on the tradition, carry 
on th at this what -- that did happen. Don™t 
let them murderers ever
 try to deny that 
that™s what they did. They 
did that. They did kill us, they
 did murder us and mistreat 
us. That definitely did, and I hope from this 
[indeciphera ble]
 children™s children 
and 
[indecipherable]
 remember that. 
Q: Do you speak to your children™
s children about your experiences? 
A: Oh yes, I do. My  grandchildren, ye
ah, I always tell them, yes. They™re old 
enough, I do always talk to
 them about it. They ask me
 questions all the time, and 
perha -- now that™s -- the cu
rriculum in the high school 
that they have, or the 
schools, or middle school, wh atever it is, 
they usually have th
e curriculum on the 
Holocaust, so they come hom
e sometimes with questions. 
And they do ask me, they 
do call me and ask me some of the que
stions. So they are aware of it. 
Q: Is there anything you™d like to add that
 we haven™t discussed, that you would like 
to discuss now, before we conclu de?
