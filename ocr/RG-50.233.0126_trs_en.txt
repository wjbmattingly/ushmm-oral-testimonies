The  dat e is June 30, 1992 a nd we
'r e spe aki ng wit h Fl ora Singer i n Potoma c, Ma ryland.  Mr s .  
Singer , c oul d you tell  me your  na me, your maide n na
me , your dat e of birt h a n

And t he n anythi ng you possi bl

My na me i s  Fl ora M endelovi cz (t hat  wa s my maid
en name) Si nger.  I was born in Berchem, a 
suburb of Antwerp, Belgium in
 1930, August 16.  
Thi ngs  I re me mb er mo st ,  my e a rlie s t 
recoll ections  were  goi ng wit h my fat h er on tri ps  
to buy me rchandise.  My fa
ther  wa s a carpenter  a nd 
he ha d a fur niture  a t elier .  He  us
ed t o go a nd buy t he  ne w c atalogs
 and furnit ure st yl es i n  a town 
named Mechellin [ph11] which la
ter on unfortunately became Maline 
in French wher
e many Jews 
were gathered during t he war befo
re t hey were transpor
ted to Auschwitz.  Howe
ver , during t he ti me  
that I'm talking about, I 
wa s around the age 
of five, six, my  fa vorite time
s  wer e goi ng on those  tri p s  
wit h my father.   I went
 t o an ele me nt ary sc hool a bout a m
ile and a half fr om home wi th my two 
sisters.  It  was a  publi c sch
ool.  We  walked, there wa s no bus 
transportation like in the United 
States.  And then after 
s c hool  we 'd go t o Yi ddish 
s chool.  The  boys  would go
 t o Hebr e w  sc hool , the 
girls woul d go and le ar n Yiddis h.
  We li ve d i n what
 was called t he Jewi
sh neighborhood of  
Antwerp which was between the 
Pillicon Stradt[ph19]
, the Longakivicz St
radt[ph20] and the 
Leverik Stradt[p h20] and the So me
r Stradt [ph20].  It wa
s al most li ke a sel f
-i mpos ed ghet t o wit h  
butc her s, ba kerie s, book 
shops , and t he syna gogues
.  We  di d not  in t hos e days spe ak a bout Re for m , 
Orthodox, or Conservative
.  Everybody was just 
Jewish.  We  were eith
er religious, a little bit 
religi ous  or  not  reli gious .  I  re me mber e njoying 
goi ng to the  syna gogue  i n 
t he morni ng.  I n 1938 , 
actually a little earlier
, because of the depression
, my dad had lost his shop
 and obtained a job with a 
ship's  c o mpa ny.  I t hink i t  was ,
 [oh I have the thing upstairs some where], I'm not sure  if it wa s the 
Star Line or the.
.., I have no recollection of th
e name of the line.  I have
 it written down 
somewhere.  
Anyway he started tr
aveling the se as as a ship's
 car pent er.  Duri ng that  ti me  he be fri ende d a  Ger ma n 
Christian.  I don't  recall his last na
me, his first  name was Carl.  It was 
important later on 
in our  li ve s. 
He woul d c o me home  only 
about  eve r y thr ee months or s o, st a y 
a fe w da ys  and the n
 go off again. 
In 1938, No vemb er of 1938, we  
received a notice from the ship's
 comp any advising us that my  
fat her ha d defecte d a nd t hat i f 
we  he ard fr om hi m t o noti fy t he m
 a nd of cour se his pay c hec k wa s  
goi ng t o be  stoppe d.  Mom wa s ve
ry upset.  Reme mber  we all cri e
d.  It wa s a terrible  da y. 
Meanwhile also at that t i me many 
r efugees start ed coming i n from
 Ge r ma ny .  It 
was right after 
Kristallnacht.  We  had several people living wi
t h  us .  The whole  J ewish
 communit y ope ne d t heir  
doors and t h eir home s t o these  
Ger ma n a nd  Au stri an r e fu gee s .
 
 
 
Ca n we  be fore we  get  to t his, ca n I a sk yo
u this :  Were your pare nts bor n in Belgium?
 

 
No, my par e nts were not  
born in Belgium.  My 
pare nts  were  born in Ro
ma nia .  My  mo ther  wa s 
bor n in Si ghet and my f a ther wa s 
born in Viso-de-Sus. They left 
i n lat e  1928 or ea r l y 1929.  A 
whole group of young people had d
ecided that they didn't want to 
deal with the 
anti-semitism in  
Ro ma ni a  an y more .   I  re call  my  mo t her  telli ng  me st
ories about Saturd
ay night.  The peasants wo ul d 
get drunk and then come  
into the Jewish street 
a s the y c alle d it and brea k wi ndows or  beat  a fe w 
people up.  And it was a l so di ffic u
lt to get jobs for Jews
.  Jews couldn't own la
nd, etc.  My father 
and mother deci ded, as I  
said, with a wh ole group 
of young people, to leav
e Roma ni a and go to a 
country na med Bel gium where t he y had hear d not onl y 
were  jobs a vail able , but
 t hat  it was a countr y 
where the people were very tolera
nt and there could be 
Jews without worrying
 about getting beate n  
up.  My mother , of cour
se , l e ft a g ainst  he r fa t her 's wi she s
 because my grandfat her was ver y  
religi ous  a nd it  was  s aid t hat  a  gir l doe s not  le av
e home until the day after sh
e 's marrie d.  My mothe r  
wa s the sec o nd youngest of si x si
st ers  and t he onl y one dari ng t o pic k up a n d lea ve home to ma ke a  
life for herself.  She di
d leave, however .  Once in Belgi u m 
the group started marrying amongst 
the mse lve s.  One young couple  would ma ke a weddi
ng for  t he next  young 
couple.  Anyway my 
fat her  and mother  deci ded t o marry
 and they ma rried in Antwerp, Be
lgium,  1929.  I 
was the first of 
three girls who was born, Au
gust 16, as I said befo
re, 1930.  Thi ngs wer e  di ffi cult  but  the y  were  
happy bec ause the y fel t  very free , es peciall y a s
 far as re ligi o n is c oncerned.  Pe opl e wer e ver y  
tolerant, Belgians were 
very t oler ant  a nd Dad eventually ope n
ed a shop where he ma de  furniture.
 
 
Wh at language did yo
u grow up speaking?
 
 
The first language I ever spoke 
was Yiddish until 
I went to Kindergarten
 and then I went to 
Kindergarten and I was su
rpri sed t o  fi nd out  there  wa s anothe r 
langua ge  and t her e were  other  pe ople  
beside Jewish people.  My world was my Jewish 
neighbor hood.  An
d I  then lear ne d Fle mis h and o f 
cour se we nt to ele me nt ar y sc hool i n t he Fle mis h 
l angua ge unti l  we  es caped
 fr om Antwerp which is 
later on.
 
 
Okay, t ha nk you for f
illing all that in.
 
 
You're welcome.  Do you 
wa nt me  t o  just  go on?
 
 
Do  you wa nt to go back
 t o t he Kri stall nac ht...?
 
 
Okay, let me  go bac k to 193
8.   Up to 19 38 even after my father 
had le ft my chil dhood wa sn't ba d.  
We  were, of c our se, ver y , ver y  ha ppy when my fa
ther wo uld come  home to 
visit because the thing 
that  we di d when he ca
me  home  to visit which we  had done 
earli er  al so was people wer e  ver y 

friendly in our neighbor
hood and alwa ys seemed to
 be  i n groups  with e
ach ot her .  On Sundays  
ever ybody used to ta ke t heir bic y
cles and go to t h e La
ngakivicz Stradt[p h87] 
Par k whic h wa s at  t he  
end of the street  that  we lived 
on a n d ha d pic nic s t here .   I woul
d sit on the back of my  father's 
bicycle and my sister would sit on 
the fr ont of his bicycle.  He ha
d a little seat on th
e front and one 
in the  bac k.  M y  mot her  would ha ve  t he  thi rd on
e on her bicycle.  Then later on when I was ol d 
enough to have my  own bicycle I wo
uld ri de  my own bi ke  a n d we 'd ge
t together  in the park and sit 
in cir cles  a nd ha ve pic nics  and 
sing.  It  was a wonde r ful  ti me
.  Th en wh en 
he  ca me bac k  
occasionall y  we'd st ill  go t o  the 
park but less and less often.  Th
e  one  nic e t hing though a bout  hi s  
visits  ba ck was that Carl would co
me wit h hi m be c a use  ther e wasn't 
enough time  for 
him to go back 
to Ger ma n y to visit  hi s fa mi l y so
 he wo uld come  to us.  And we 
gre w  quite cl ose  
to Carl and we 
love d hi m ve ry much and he  see me d
 t o love  us .  Anywa y
, let me get back to 
1938.  In 1938 we had, 
as I said, several people living w
ith us  and one of t he m wa s a Mr. 
Gr oss, Mr. a nd Mrs. Gross.  Her r  
Gr oss  a s we  used t o call  hi m woul
d talk about the things
 that had gone on 
in Germany.  And I 
re me mb er b eco mi ng ver y fr
i ghte ne d- -I was t he n a bout ei ght  ye ars old-- and aski ng my mother  abou t  
these things that Herr Gross would 
te ll us .  And s he said, 
oh, don't  worr y, old people exa gger ate .  
Spe aki ng of old pe opl e, I  thi nk Mr . 
Gross  was  no more t ha n a bout 45 
or  s o at  the ti me .  I kne w tha t 
later on when I grew 
up.  But he was old t o me then a nd t o my
 mother who wa s only
 in her thirties. 
So she s aid, no he  exaggera
tes.  Those things coul
dn't pos sibl y  ha ppe n, th
at  ther e was al ways anti-
semitism and being a Jew 
we had to know that
 these things would 
happen.  People would  
occasionall y want to beat
 us up.  Ti me s woul d s o meti mes be be
tter, sometimes wors
e for Jews.  But 
that the very things Mr. Gross 
talked about couldn't possi bly happ
en, especially in a country lik e 
Germany, that there was more anti-
se miti s m i n ot her countri es  tha n 
in Germany.  However, I found 
out lat er that  Mr. Gross wa s not 
wrong.  Ea rly 1940 t h
ere was a program i n 
Ant wer p where by poor 
children wo uld be sent to a camp  ne
ar t he sea for t wo weeks to sort  
of rehabilitate their health and 
their malnutrition and 
feed them good fo od.  My
 sister and I were elig
ible for the 
program, the 
mi ddle one and myself.  She was at the time  almost  
se ve n ye ars  ol d.  As  a ma tter  of fact I thi nk s h e  
wa s just about seven, 
right, because she had been 
seve n in M ar ch.  This  wa s 
the month of late April, 
early May.  So we were  bot h se nt a w ay t o ca mp
s for...t he y us ed t o call  
it Etholunk[ph115] which  
was to get into better
 health, to become  healthy. 
 She  was  s e nt  to one  ca mp, 
I  wa s  se nt  to a not her .  
May 10, the  morni ng tha t  wa r was 
declared and t h
e Ger mans mar che
d into Belgium, I was at one 
ca mp , my  si ster wa s at a not her,  a nd  my  mo the r  wa
s home  with Bett y who wa
s not  quite four  at  the 
time .  All I know is comi ng down 
to breakfast that morning, on Ma
y 10, and there wa
s a small radi o 
in the dini ng room on a  s hel f an
d one of the moni tors turned the 
radio on.  Th e mu sic stopped and 
an announce me nt  was  made
 that the Germans were 
walking into Belgium.  
I reme mber not  realizin g 
what that meant but sudd
enly chaos r eigned i n t he  dini ng room
.  The moni t ors wer e running ar ound 
and r us hing us  to fi nis h  our  brea kfas t a nd r us hin
g us  up t o  t he  dor mit or
i es, ma king us  pack our  
bags, put ting us on bus ses and th
ey took us ba ck t o Ant w e r p.  
When I  got  ba ck to Ant wer p I  
remember chaos rei gni ng there to
o.  Pe opl e wer e  loadi ng ca rs, t h
e y wer e loadi ng horse wa gons , 
they were loading bi kes ,  and goi
ng.  People wer e scre a ming and 
carr ying on.  Wh
e n  I aske d my 
mother what  was going on she sai d
 the Ger mans are comi ng i n  and t hey
 are terrible.  Th ey tortured 
people duri n g World Wa r I and s he 
descri bed some  horribl e things.  
Supposedl y they cut off ears 
and bre asts  of wome n a nd all t hat.  Whet her  it 
wa s a rumor or whether 
it actually happened of 
cour se  I  pers onall y don't  know.  
But  ever yone  wa s t erribl y fri ghte ne d  of t he  Ger ma n, not  onl y the  

Jews, the Christians also. 
 Everyone ran, Ca
tholic and Jew.  My mother
 was a little confused.  She 
didn't know wh at to do.  So me one 
who had a car and 
had a trundle seat in th
e back offered us that 
seat.  At tha t  poi nt there wa s mys e
l f, my mot her a nd Bett
y, t he  youngest of the 
three.  Charlotte was  
not  with us  yet.  M y mother di dn
't know what to do.  
Shoul d s he wai t  a nd see 
if Charlotte would be 
brought home.  She tri ed cont acting 
t h e ca mp.  Appare ntly 
either the phone lines 
were cut or no one  
was t here to answer, but  she coul
dn't  make c ont a c t.  She  was  ve
r y upset  beca use  the people  who 
owned the car said, well look, we 'r
e leaving in an hour. 
 If you go with us fine, otherwise we 'r e 
givi ng t his  s eat to so meone el se.  I di dn't know it 
at the  ti me , howe ver , lat e
r on I learned fr om my  
mother that she had a terrible d
ilemma t o  deal  wit h.  Her  decisi
on had to be doe
s she stay and 
perhaps have her two children kille
d and lose all three because she 
started giving up on
 Charlotte at 
this poi nt not knowing what happe n
e d to her , or doe s s he t ake t wo 
chil dr en, run to 
Fr ance be cause 
that 's where ever ybody was 
headed for, and sa
ve t wo childre n.  Appa rentl y
 her deci sion wa s to sa ve  
two chil dre n  beca use  we  got  i nto t he  t rundle  se at, t h
e three of us
 with two small valises.  My mother  
carried Betty, who had th
e measles at the time an
d wa s fever i sh,  a nd  we  we nt t o  Fr an ce.   Th e car  
broke down be for e we  e ver got  to
 Fr ance  or  ra n out of ga s, I  d
on't know which of the two but we 
continued on fo ot.  We became  part
 of the hord of refu
ge es he ading for  Northe
rn France that we re 
preventi ng t he all i es from pull i ng 
back because t he r oads wer e crowde
d with refugees. 
 We s l ept  i n  
the fie l ds  and oc casi onal l y in the  bar n.  We got
 r id of one sui tcase beca
use Mom coul d not carry 
Bett y and a suitcase.  I  co
uld not handle both suitcase
s so we  were down to 
one  s uitc ase  at one  poi nt 
and we conti nue d wa lki n g.
 
 
You were headed for nort hern France?
 
 
For northern Fr ance, right, becaus
e  se e the Ger ma ns we re behi nd us . 
 They walked into Belgium. 
Troops were pulling back
 and we  were foll owing or  getting mi ngl
ed in with the troops that  were 
pulli ng bac k beca use  t he  Ger ma ns  ha d not  e nter ed Fran
ce yet.  And northern Fr
ance is the closest to 
Belgium, like Lille, Calais, 
and those areas.  A
nyway we got to Ca
lais.  We  got to 
Calais and once 
in Calais, let me just re
tract a little bit.  The re
ason we had gotten the le
tter that my father had 
defect ed from the ship wa
s--of course I learned t hi s after the 
war--he had a sister 
in New York who 
had been her e since she was eleven 
years old, right after Wo rld War I 
when their fa ther got killed on  
the front a nd my gr andmother  wa s le
ft  with fi ve children, her sister
 in New York, an
 aunt  in Ne w  
York rather had offered t o rai se t h
e girl.  She wa s  the onl y gir l  of fi
ve chil dren, t he others wer e all  
sons.  So she lived in Ne
w Yor k.  My father was i n contact  with
 he r.  His ship docked in Ca na da 
and was goi ng to be t her e for about
 three days.  He  calle
d my aunt being he 
wa s so c lose  a nd she  
i mmediat ely, as soon as she realiz
ed that  it wa s her brot her , said
 Davi d, don't go bac k beca use  
Krist allnacht  had alr eady happened. 
 She  tol d hi m what happene d; 
he wasn't aware of it.  He 
insist ed that  he ha d t o  
go back to Belgiu
m,  that he wasn't  going to
 leave Fannie 
and the three 
childr en but  some how she co
nvi nce d hi m that s he wo
uld shortl y a fter  he woul d come  t o the  Unite d 
State s, woul d bring Fa nnie
 and the t h ree chil dren out .  She sent
 a car  for  hi m.  
The y s muggled my 
fat her  int o  the Unit ed Stat es i n a 
holl o we d out  se at of a  c ar.  So not  
only di d he de fe ct but  he  e ntere d 
the United States illegally.  
I didn't dare say this for ma
ny years.  It's  only very
 recently that I started  

telling this story but it is typical 
of how people got into
 the United States wh
en the United States 
close d its  doors  t o s o  ma ny.  
M y aunt  i m me di ately unde r her 
own patronage and her husband's 
started working on getting 
us a visa after they had written my
 mother a coded 
letter letting her 
know, i n Yi ddis h, letti ng he
r know that my fa ther wa
s safe.  It  didn't work.  
At t he ti me the quot a, 
especiall y for Roma
nian citizens and even thou
gh  we  were  b o r n in  Belg
ium we were considered 
Romani an ci tizens, not fr om Roum
a n ia, Rouma ni a di d not  rec ognize  us , but a s fa r a s t he Bel gia ns  
were concerned, who did not reco
gnize us as Belgian citizens.  
Anyway, we never made it.  We  
re mained in Belgium and 
the war st arted.  So a nywa y, getti ng 
back to Calais.  
Wh en we  go t  t o  
Calais it was evening and 
my mot her  notic ed a bi g Red Cr os s  shi p
 at t he port; we wer e at the port  
and she noti ced a big Red Cr
oss shi p.  She then made a decisi on. 
 She de cided i f  she c ould just fi nd  
out wher e the ship went  and i f sh
e  c oul d get on t o that shi p a nd 
ma ke her way to 
wherever  it was 
and from there to the Uni ted Stat es
 we 'd  all  be  sa fe, t he 
thre e of us  of c our s e, not  Char lotte who we  
didn't  ha ve  wit h us.  Be fore we le ft, howeve r, 
my mother told people, 
neighbors and friends who 
wer e packi n g and goi ng off in
 di ffere nt dir ecti ons , that i f anyone s aw Char lotte t o pl eas e take her ,  
kee p her, a n d s he 'd be back for  
her.  Anyway she wal k
ed up to the ship, fo
und out  t hat t he  Re d 
Cross shi p was ta king wounded sol d
ie rs to Engl and, and as
ke d the m i f  they woul
d take us on.  They 
said that if we would wa
it they would see if
 t he y had r oo m for us and t h
e y would t hen perhaps  ta ke  
us with them.  We  
sat at the port on ou
r little suitcase, the one
 that we had left
, and waited until  
da wn.  Da wn ca me a nd they tol d 
us that t her e was no mo
re room, they could no
t take us.  So we 
turned away fr om t he port and 
we tri e d t o fi nd some  
food.  The Re d Cros s 
was giving out  food in 
churches and all kinds of 
places and so we 
were fe d a little bit.  We got
 some milk for the baby, I  
mean Betty who was not quite fo ur 
and ill, to boot.  I still don't k
now how she surviv
ed the measles 
wit hout aft er  effect s beca
use she 's  a fairly healt hy woman toda y. 
 We ende d up i n a she lter beca use  
an air raid came and Mom left  
the shelter after the alar m came 
on that people could leave th e 
shelter.  I was left  in th
e shelter with Betty on my la
p.  Betty was thirsty, st
arted to cr y.  Ther e wa s 
no one left  in the shelter but the two of us.  It  
was dark.  It wa s frighteni
ng.  Mom wa sn't  comi ng 
back.  I recall sitting there fo r 
the longest time and not
 moving because the on
e thing we always did 
- we al wa ys obe ye d my mother .  
The r e was ne ver  any thought  of di
sobeying he r, Ma ma  wa s al wa ys 
obe ye d, e ve n int o a dult h ood it was ra ther di ffic ult  to
 di sobey her for di ffer e n
t reasons.  I remember 
becoming so frightened at one poin
t after having sat there for so 
long and Betty c
ryi ng because she  
wa s t hirsty.  I wa s t hirsty al so, 
I was  also hungr y.  Finall y I  was 
frightened enough to
 stray outside 
of the shelter.  It was dark an
d I wa s eve n more  fri ght ene d.  
There's something I never tell my  
children to this day 
and they are very comfortabl
e in the dark.  I am stil
l fri ght ene d  of the  dar k 
although I hate to admi
t  i t .  That  doe s n 't  mea n  I don't  go out , I '
m not a prisoner of it
, but there is that 
dee p-see de d fea r of the  dark t o  thi s day.  I went  
out;  I  sta r te d r unni ng;  I  st arted cryi ng;  I  st arted  
calling Mama, Mama.  There 
was no one in the stre
et.  Finally I heard a 
voice fr om a distance 
sayi ng Fl ora , Flora .  And I yelle d M a ma, Ma ma .  
And anyway we found eac h ot her ,  We trie d t o  
fi nd a s helte r and we e n ded up in
 a railroa d st ati on.  We  sa w a  
train being mounted by a lot of 
people; we  tried to get on the tr
ain.  We  didn't know where the 
train was going but anyplace wa s 
better  t han where we were. 
 The train wa s so  packed that we  c
oul dn't  get  on it , so we  were  le ft  
behi nd.  It se e med like  it wa s t he l a
st t r ain out .  We  sat  down i n the 
corner of the railroad station and  
spent the night there.  In
 the morni ng, I just coul
dn't carry the suitcase anym
ore.  I felt very weak  
and tired and Mama just 
told me to leave the su
itcase in a corner and we
 left .  Mama
 was still 

carryi ng Bet t y.  We  ma de it  all t he  wa y t o Boul ogn
e-Sur-Mer.  Our goal at
 this point was Paris 
because my mother  fi gur ed that  i f  
we  ca n just  get  to Pari s, we  coul
d get fr om Paris 
t o London.  We  
did not make it to Paris because the Germans caugh
t up wit h  us i n  Boul o
gne- S ur-Mer .  We  wer e  
take n i n by a ca fe owner .  Her  na
me wa s Marta, I'll ne ver forget th
at.  We stayed ther e for several  
weeks.  There's somethin
g very interesting, a little
 side-tracking here.  Th
ere was a lot of pillaging 
goi ng on.  Eve r y ti me  there wa s a n air ra id a
nd st ore s got bombed, pe
opl e were goi ng i n a n d 
pillaging.  I was out when 
there was an air raid but 
I couldn't get into a she
lter, I couldn't get home, 
so I crouched down in a doo
rway and sat out the air ra
id there.  When I came 
out of my little corner  
I notice d pe ople  runni ng int o a  st ore  and ta king t hin
gs.  I t  wa s a  shoe  st or e 
a nd I had notic ed a pai r  
of white boots there before
.  I noticed the white boot
s were stil l t here .  So e ve rybody els e wa s taki ng 
things.  I didn't realize at the ti
me  that it was something wrong about
 it .  I mi ght  have felt  it  de ep 
down but I didn't realize t here wa
s s o met hing wr ong wit h it .  I  took
 the white boots and I put them 
on a nd I  we nt t o  the ca
fe  wh ere  we  were sta yin g  wit h t he m.  
 Anyway Mom was ve
ry angry but she 
didn't ha ve t he heart t o t a ke t he bo
ots off.  But a fe w days later, as
 I was wal king the str e et, s o me one  
grabbe d me by t he c ollar  in the bac k
 and pull e d me i nto a st ore.  I t
 was t he st ore owner, pulle d me  
into his boar ded up stor e  and pulled 
the boots off my  fe et and I we nt
 ba ck to the  ca fe bar e foot.  
These are so me  of the side
 things that happened.
 
 
What  ti me  of ye ar wa s it ?
 
 
Thi s was someti me in June of 19
40.  Meanwhile Ger mans were alread
y in Belgium, they were in a  
good part of France.  Th e Germans 
gave out  a decree that  all  non-Fr e
nc h r eside nts  had to retur n  to  
the country of th
ei r  ori gi n.  So we  ha d to ma ke  our  way ba
c k  t o  Belgi u m havi ng j ust  a  fe w fr ancs 
give n us  by Marta  to kee p us  fe d 
on t he  roa d  ba ck.  We
 couldn't afford trans
port atio n  so  we  walk ed  
agai n.  By now Betty wa s bett er a nd we walke d.  We
 hit ch- hi ked and one of the car s t hat we hitc h-
hiked was a Ger man car and Mot her  
gave me stri ct instruc tions not
 to underst and eit h er Ger ma n,  
Yiddis h, or Fle mi sh.  Anywa y we made our  way 
to Antwerp.  When we got back to Antwerp, one 
of our nei ghbors  ha d als o r etur ne d  a nd had Char lotte
 with her.  Charlotte 
is alive today and is a  
grandmot her  and lives i n Ne w York.  Thi ngs se e m ed 
slowly to return
 nor mal except t hat there wer e  
Ger ma ns  t he r e and i n  Se pte mber  sc hool  st arte d a gai
n.  There were air  rai ds,
 t here  we re bombings  
and all  t hat  but  the Jews 
were not really bothered 
yet.  We returned to sc
hool  in Septe mber .   The  
one  thi ng that di d ha ppe ned withi n t hat foll owing 
year I don't recall the ex
act dates but men were 
called up for labor.  They we re told that if they
 vol untari l y pres ent t he ms e
lv es fo r wor k i n Ger ma ny  
that  wives and childr en would not  
be bot hered.  I don't  r ecall  whet
her  thi s was for  both Christians  
and Je ws or  just  for  Je ws.  But 
anyway, my mo ther's youngest sist
er  was also i n Antwer p at the 
ti me .  What  happened aft er my mot h er had settl ed
 down in Belgium in 1
929, she had eventually 
sent , when I was about t h ree year s 
ol d she s ent for  her youngest  sist
e r a nd br ought her  to Bel gium.  
My younges t  sist er?  [I 
assume  her mother's  young
est  sister ] had met a Pol i
sh emigree by the name  
of Ale x Che cha noff [ph3
04] and mar r ied hi m a nd ha
d a boy in 1940 by th
e name of Nathan, we  
called hi m Nunu.  M y  uncl e 's  na me was  Ale x Ch
echanoff [ph307].  Uncle 
Alex a nd hi s brot her  
Adolph Che cha noff [ph309] who wa s 
also i n Antwer p, they wer e 
ca lled up and we nt  to work in 

Ger ma n y wi th a  lot  of ot her me n.  They ca me  ba c k
 about three months later.
  This happened twice 
and t wi ce t h ey ca me back.  When t hey got cal l ed
 up the third time my mother, she had an amazing 
instinct and very often he
r i nsti nct  se rved her  wel l , ha d t his  
gut feeli ng that so
mething was wr ong 
this ti me.  She said, Alex, I woul
dn't  go.  Alex sa id, come  on Fann
ie you're alwa ys worrying.  An d 
she  sai d, Ale x plea se  don't go.  She sa id I  have a 
bad feeli ng.  Ale x liste ne d t o her  a nd he took hi s  
wi fe  a nd chi l d a nd move d to Brus sels .  He l e ft be
c a use  ot her wis e they woul
d ha ve  pr oba bly c o me  to 
arrest hi m.  The y move d to Brusse
l s and t he y li ve d in Sc arbe c  [ph3
23] on La Place de la Cage aux 
Zus a  [ph324].  The  me n who we nt 
this time did no
t come  back.  I don't kn
ow wh at happened to 
them.  However, they ne
ver came back.  Ti
me we nt on.  We were c alle d 
up to r egi ster a nd buy, 
quote buy a Jewish star.  My mo ther
 had t o go to a Bur eau a n d t he  
Je wi sh star , they were cut  off a  
bolt .  It was l ike buying a yard or
 t wo of goods, fabric, texti le.  
They decided how 
much each fami l y  
needed.  Th ey cut it off the bolt an
d you paid accordingly.
  I f you di dn't  ha ve
 t he  money you ha d t o  
fi nd  it so me wh ere.  Anyway Mo m came ho me  with th
ese Je wish star s, c ut th
em out and very neatly 
had to se w t he m on, t wo inc hes  from
 the top, two inches 
from the  ar m on t he le ft si de  of our outer  
gar me nts .  So now I  ha d to wear  a  
star to school  which was not very pl easant.  Needless to say, my  
sisters  a nd I  start ed bei n g s ubj ect to ins ults , t o 
a few pushes, etc.  And 
I st arte d ha ting sc hool  
wherea s  I  had al wa ys  l o ved school  be for e.  At  ab
out that same time, I don
't  know i f  it  wa s  t wo 
mont hs, t hre e mont hs  la t er we were  
t old t hat  we  c oul dn't  go to public
 school anymore, that we  could 
onl y go to our J e wis h s c hool.
 
 
What  gra de  wer e yo
u i n at the ti me?
 
 
At that point I was in
 mi ddle of fourth grade.  
I was in fo urth grade.  I wa
s ten that August and I had 
entered fo urth grade that Septembe
r, so I wa s in the mi
ddl e of fourt h gra de  when I  st opped going t o  
school .  My initial r eacti on was I ha
t ed not bei ng able to go t o school
 but  at that point  I was glad  
also beca us e  I  re ally ha d a di ffic ul
t  ti me deali ng wit h  the chil dren 
and wit h the cryi ng of my sister s 
when they wer e push
ed around.  I said to my  
si sters, " Well  don't  worr y so
 we won't go to sc hool , 
we 'll  go t o  t he  par k  and play."   We  c oul d al ways go
 to t he  par k.  The  pa rk 
was a beautiful park.  It 
had a lake, it had swans, 
and we  really loved 
the park.  It wa s almost like
 a refuge.  And we  headed 
for  the  par k.  We  get  t o  the pa
rk and there was a si
gn, NO JEWS  ALLOWE D. 
 Actually NO JEWS  
AND DOGS ALLOWE D.  But there 
was no gate, no do
or.  There was no on
e around so we 
deci ded, well we'll go in
 anyway.  We wal ked int o t he par k and 
after we  had gone 
j u st  a  fe w yar d s a  
guard appeared out of nowhere and 
he didn't say a word.  
He  just shook his fing
er  back and forth as 
if to sa y No, No, No, and 
pointing towards the exit.  
I re me mb er  maki ng  a fa ce 
as if to say why can't 
I go i n.  He kept shaki ng his fi nger
 a nd poi nting t o the  exit .  So we 
left  and I told my sisters, don't 
worry we ca n al wa ys go to the mo
vie s be cause I had a fe w fr ancs . 
 Mama  always gave me a fe w 
francs to take care of my sisters.  So we went 
to the movies, we  get to 
the cashi er 's window -  th e 
same thing .  There was a sign 
NO JEWS  ALLOWE D.  By now I 
was getting pretty upset.  My 
hea d st arte d dr ooping.  My siste rs of course we
re ups et al s o.  We  c oul dn't underst a nd why we  
coul dn't go i n.  Our c l ot hes were  
clea n, we  di dn't do a nythi ng that we
 knew of, so we
 decided to get 
some i ce- cr eam.  We 
get to the ice-cream parl
or , the s a me t hi ng, NO 
J E WS ALL O WE D.   An d b y  

the ti me we headed for  home wit h 
our hea ds  pret t y low. 
 But once we got near 
our hous e it was  fine 
because ther e were ot her childr en 
there with stars 
who proba bl y had experi ence d t he sa me  thi ng we  
had and we j ust pla yed in the  st
re et.  That bec a me our  pla ygr ound fo
r  the  ne xt fe w mont hs.  As  ti me  
we nt on things became worse and worse.  It was 
not  re gular  but al l of a s u dde n t he  ges t apo st arte d 
coming around with little wago
ns, small wagons, they lo
ok like so me of our 
own recreation wagons 
here in t he Uni ted Stat es where 
you can put in maybe te
n, twelve people in 
the back.  They wo uld 
come around, they were 
unmarked and they wo uld st
op.  Onc e t hey 
stopped a sire n we nt on, se ver al 
gestapo me n wo uld jump  out, woul
d go into a building a
nd bri ng a  fe w pe ople  out .  In a dditi on t o  
the stars, in Belgium unli
ke the United States
 everybody had to 
carry an identity ca
rd.  We  have one  
here too.  We have drivers' licen
ses, social security 
cards.  However, there 
it was a regular identity 
card wit h  your  phot ogra p h, pl ace  of bi
rth, date  of birth, 
whether you were married
 or  not, 
and if you 
were married - the children and when
 the chil dre n  we re bor n.  It was 
lit eral ly an on-goi ng r ecor d of 
your li fe  that  you carrie d wit h you 
at all times.  The Be
l gia n c itizens ' car ds  were gre en, forei gners ' 
cards were yellow with a re
d band across.  I still ha
ve mine fr om after the wa
r.  It still was yellow 
wit h a  re d ba nd acr oss  a n d e ve n t hough it  sa ys  bor n
 in Belgium, it sa ys in
 two la ngua ges " etra nger " 
and stranger in both Fle
mish and French.  I n a dditi on t o t hat  
ba nd and t he word stra nge r or foreigne r  
duri ng t hat  period of ti me  Je ws  ha d a sta mp put on
 just about the same ti
me t hat  the stars were 
hande d out  i n bot h l anguages "Jo
ff"[ph418] in Flemish 
and "Jui f" i n  Fr ench and t h e si ze of the 
stamp, the letters were almo
st three quarters of an 
inch bi g so eve n i f you 
coul dn't  rea d  the m fr o m  
far, seeing those two stamps on 
the yellow part of th
e identity card, one knew
 immediately who you  
wer e.  So my mother  carried one 
of thos e.  I  wa s not  ol d e n ough 
yet to have one.  You weren't 
requi red to have one unti l  you we re 
fi fteen ye ars of age.  But all Je
ws carr i ed an i dentit y car d li ke 
that in addition to the stars.  
Well  anyway when t he gest apo t hen
 would j u mp out  of t hese  wagons  
and go into a build
ing all they had to do wa s 
ask for document s and they were able to pick the Je ws 
out  and bri n g t he m in.  I n our  ne
ighborhood of course mo st of th
e  people  i n our  a part m ent hous es  
wer e Je ws, there were very fe w Christia ns .  
They ca me a round ir regul
arly.  The men i n our  
neighborhood built a sort of labyrin
th between buildings. The buildings were a
ttached.  They built a 
labyri nt h where t hey opened up a wall eit her i n  
a cl oset  or  be hind a  wa
ll, conceal e d door s, in 
base me nt s a nd you were able  to esc ape thr ough th
ese hidde n openi ngs fr om one buil di ng t o anothe r  
and exit seve ral bl ocks a wa y a nd be s afe, t e mpora r ily
 anyway.  It became a ga me .  Ever y time we 'd  
hear that little sire
n we would of course imme
diately be activate
d as you would sa
y; we ran.  It 
became  a game with us kids.  
We
 knew it was dangerous.  We  
kne w lives  wer e i n danger . 
However, it was very ex
citing.  The idea was well let's see w
ho's going to get cau
ght now.  Anyway 
this went on for awhile. 
 Meanwhile Jews were stil
l able to work and ea rn 
some money but less and 
less so, dependi ng on what you di
d.  Mo m wor ked at t hat poi nt. 
 She  coul d onl y get work in a  
restaurant.  She worked in 
the restaurant.  Let me re
tract a little bit.  
Just before we 
put the stars on, 
Mom would smuggle food from nort hern
 France  to Belgium.  I won't go
 into all the details on it but 
I did accomp any her  occasion
ally.  She woul d let  me  c arry l et 's sa
y like a box with five kilograms of 
sugar.  I had to pretend 
t hat it was a doll and i f someone, a cu
stom's agent or so
meone else would 
come  near me and would wa nt to
 see in my  box, I wo ul
d start screaming and 
crying, don't touch my 
ne w doll .   I  just  got i t  a n d you'll  brea k it .  Ni ne
 ti me s out  of t e n pe opl e we
re sympat hetic and t hey 
didn't  touc h my ne w doll .  Howeve r,
 occasionally we  did have thin
gs  ta ke n away fr om us and we 
had to pa y a fine .  Aft e r a wh
il e though it  be ca me  too dangero
us a nd Mom st oppe d doing t hat  

especiall y  after we had to wear  
the st ars.  Then it was st oppe d 
totally.  We  also couldn't get 
rationing stamps anymor e 
so i t became a very precari ous exis
tence.  You work, you try t o buy 
things on the black market and ma
ke do t hat  wa y.  M o m als o se
wed in the evenin
g and we  kids  
helped her.  We  als o  di d this  a f
t er  the  li berati on.  Lace  could not  
be  gotte n so Mom ma de  sl ips .   I 
did the hand-work where I made lik
e a little escallop on the 
bottom of the slips and on the top.  One  
of us tur ned the shoul der  straps i n
si de  out t hat Mom se we d.  The ot her one  ironed.  It  wa s a  fa mil y  
affair to earn a little money for brea
d.  Anyway time went 
on and the Germans, 
the Nazis rather, - I 
won't say Ge rmans because I feel ve
r y strongl y that t here  is  a  di ff
erence between so
me one  bor n on  
a certai n s oil  and some one taki ng on a  certai n ideol
ogy - the ges t apo ke pt c o mi ng a r ound, as I  sai d, 
occasionally, mo re and mo
re often.  Sometimes they'd stay away a week or two, sometimes they'd 
come  da y a f t er day.  I t  was very
 irre gular and one  could al mos t no
t prepare for it.  Meanwhile, one 
day a s Mom was  hea ding home  and try t o bea t cu
rfew [curfew for Christia
ns was at  that time I 
belie ve eight  p.m. i f I  rec all c orrectl y and se ve n 
p.m. for Jews ] she was tryi
ng t o ma ke c ur fe w whe n  
some one  cal led her  na me  and s he  star ted t o r un, 
s he t urned ar ound and s a w 
a Ger man in a gest apo 
uni for m.  Actuall y he  wore t he  bl ac k uni for m a nd 
we found out later that 
he was at tached t o  the 
comma nda nt eur of Ant w erp. 
 She sta r ted runni ng quic ker .  It wa s 
Carl , my fat her 's  ol d frie nd Carl.  
Carl  c aught  up with her ,  wa nted
 to know where my  father was, 
how my father was doing.  My 
mother  t old hi m she  ha d had no ne
ws  of hi m whic h wa s  r
eally a lie but she told
 hi m she didn't know 
where he wa s.  Sometimes she chan
ged;  she sai d once t hat  she did te
ll him that he 
was in America 
and ot her  ti me s she  to
ld me that she told
 hi m that  she didn't  know wher e 
he was.  So I really don't 
know because that  was hearsa
y by my mot her .  But what
 I know is that Carl was there.  He started 
coming to visit, bringing us fo
od.  My mothe r  aske d hi m one 
day t hough t o not c o me ar ound  
anymore because our neigh
bors would ask questions.  
What is this a German is coming to your 
house.  Anyway, he didn't come  ar
ound for a fe w weeks or  a couple
 of mont hs  ma
ybe even.  One 
day, I 'll ne ve r for get t hat  day, Carl  ca ught up wit h
 my mother agai n.  He di
dn't c o me  t o the house  
but he caught up with her in the 
street.  Apparently he
 must have been waitin
g for her.  He said,  
Fannie  i f  you can go home
, take the children and s
ee if you can get yourself
 out of town.  And she 
said  wh y wh at 's  the  ma
tter.  He said I can't tell 
you, just trust me and get ou
t of town.  And with that  
he turned around and left.  Ma ma 
came home, very little 
was  said.  She  t o ok our stars  off our  c oat , 
rubbed the coat with her nails to 
make sure that  t h e mar k
ings weren't showing, 
put  a double l aye r of 
clothi ng on e ach of us , 
took the albums in a bag under her arm an
d we  left.  We  were
 going to go to 
Brussels.  To go from Antw
erp t o
 Br ussel s is real ly 
a si mple thing.  It's al
mo st no longer than going 
fr om Sil ver Spri ng to Washi ngt on.  
It 's about a for t y mi nute , forty- five
 minute train ri
de.  You go to 
the train station, you buy 
a ticket, you get on a train, you get 
to Brus sel s, you get off the  trai n.  
That's the extent of the 
trip, very simple.  Howeve
r, we had a fe w problems
.  We  were illegal, we 
had taken our stars off, Mom had an
 identity card if it were
 asked of her to be
 shown which had Jew  
on t her e, it wa s yellow wit h a  re d band
 with the two stamps 
of Jew.  So it wasn
't  that simple.  But 
she acted as if it were.  She went 
over to the ticket 
window.  She bought four 
ticket s.  We went on t o  
the trai n.  We sat  and 
made our  way to Br
ussels.  Occasionally tr ains
 would be st opped, gestapo 
would get  on t he  trai ns .  The y w
ould ask for documents.  
I n  thi s  case for some
 rea son we  got  t o  
Brussel s, no one  stoppe d the  trai n. 
 Now we  ha ve  to get  out  of the  ra
ilroad station.  ..
..bi g, beauti ful  
staircase that led down to the main level and to
 the exit.  We  get to 
t he stair case.  Mom was  
wo nd erin g, we we re ju s t  follo wi ng 
her, as t o how she was  goi ng t o
 handle this in case she was 

stopped.  We get to t he staircase, 
t he staircase was packed wit h a mo
b of peopl e.  We c oul d not ge t  
on t o t he st e ps.  We  di dn't rea
lize at first why but then Mom notic
ed at the bottom of the st aircase 
there was a check-point  and t here 
wer e se veral  ge s t apo men wit h s o
me Belgian police.  The Belgian 
polic e we ren't doi ng a nyt hing.  They
 wer e c hec ki ng docume nts.  M o
m sa ys t o  us , "pi c k a fi ght ."  
We  ne ver questi one d M o m, we al ways obe ye d, espe
ciall y once t he war came.  We start fighting,  
screaming, kicking.  I'm the first 
one who started being I'm the oldest
. I knew exactly what  to do.  I  
started pulling my sister
's hair, pinching her, push
ing her.  One started to cr
y, the other one started to  
cry;  we  started to scream at e
ach other  a nd we  kne w  we  c oul dn
't stop until  we  got  or der s from 
Mama.  Pe ople were getting very 
annoyed around us.  They were al
re ady te nse ,  a ppa r ently.  The y  
started letting us through just so 
that we  shouldn't both
er  them.  Anyway we 
get to the bottom still 
screaming, kicking, fi ghting 
and one of the gestapo me
n said to my mother  to the effect  "stop those 
kids " a nd my mot her  ma de belie ve 
she di dn't unde rstand.  We  conti n ued fi ghti ng and fi nally he sa id 
"take  your  kids  a nd get  out  of he
re ."   Mom pr ete n ded not  t o  under s
tand even though that's  exactly 
what  she wanted t o 
do and fi nall y one  of t he  Fr
enc h poli ce, not  Fre nch poli c
e, one of th
e Belgians, I 
really don't recall whethe
r it was the Belgian or on
e of t he Fr ench.  Someone
 in French said why  
don't  you take the kids and 
get out of here in a very 
curt voice.  So we did.  
Mom took us a nd we  le ft  
still screaming and fighting, 
but not too fast and not 
too slow.  We made our 
way out of the station. 
We  wal ke d a fe w bl oc ks  and finall y stoppe d and 
caught  our breath.  We 
s topped fi ghti ng and we  
felt very safe.  We  still don't unde
rstand.  We  had so ma
ny incidents like that wh
ere we felt that we 
had literally crawled out th
rough the eye of the ne
edle.  We  made our wa
y to my aunt's hous e 
beca use  we  kne w whe r e she  lived.  We  didn't  know t h
is through the mail.  We
 knew it by word of 
mout h, pe ople who had c o me t o Ant w
er p.  That 's  how we got  the  ad
dres s.  From t her e  we found a  
small apartment, we 
got settled in and we neve
r put the stars on again. 
 An d  my  mo ther  ha d t h e  
audacity of enrolling us in public 
school .  She ent r uste d a  neighbor wit h
 our story.  You 
ha d t o tr ust .   
That wa s one of the big problems . 
 You didn't  know wh o to trust bu
t you had to take some one into 
your confide nce .  Somet i me s it  work
ed, sometime s it doesn'
t.  We were lucky.  Most  of the people 
that we trusted were trus
tworthy as we can attest
 because we are 
still here.  The 
neighbor who we 
took into our trust le
t us use her name .  Her name
 was Fiers.  So my mother became Fannie Fiers, I 
became Flor a Fiers, Char lo
tte Fiers, a
nd Betty Fier s.
 
 
Yo ur first name s weren't...?
 
 
We  did not change our first names 
because they we re Belgian names.
 
 
It wasn't  indicative th
at you were  Je wish?
 
 
They weren't indicative and the reason that we di dn't
 change  them was my mother  felt that it woul d 
be easier to remember if we we
re called by someone and we wo
uld not  make a mi s t ake  of not  
knowi ng.  She felt  that j ust
 a  last  na me  wa s easi er t o work with
, es pecially with th
e little ones.  By  

this time it was early '4
2.  I  was eleven and Char
lotte wa s j u st about  eight a nd Bet t y wa s fi ve s o  
Betty at fi ve was st
ill very young.  I, of cour
se, would have understood but
 it would have been very  
di fficult for them if thei
r first names were changed. 
 They c oul d ha ve  pr obab
ly done it but there was 
no nee d bec ause  the y were s uch Bel gian na me s .   
Anyway, s he e nrol l ed us i n s chool  wit h st rict  
instructions not to ever 
tell anybody that we
 were  Je wi sh.  We  start ed 
school and the te
acher s were 
fri ght ene d of one partic ul ar c hild 
who happe ned to be i n 
my mi ddle  si ster 's class .  Her brothe r wa s a  
Belgian Nazi.  A Belgian 
on the  whol e was ver y a n
ti- Nazi  but there was a Fl
emish element that felt 
they ha d l os t  aut onomy and looke d 
to the Germans to gi ve them ba
ck aut ono my of t h eir count ry  
which they thought had lost to the French speaki
ng pe opl e.  So there wer e
 Belgian Nazis.  There 
wa s a whole  group of mostly Fl e m
is h Belgi an Nazis.  Her br other  
was.  We call ed t h em the Blac k 
Shirt s.   So me o f t he m w o
re brown shirts.  They 
wore  br own or  blac k shi rts.  Anywa y my sist er  
Charlott e had a fight wit h 
thi s girl and she t hreat ened to get  he
r bi g brot he r on he r.  Nor mall y thi s 
would not  be a  bi g dea l  but i n this  partic ular  ca se
 it was.  The 
teacher told the 
principal .  The  
princi pal  call ed me  in and sai d I 'd 
bet t er call  my mother  in
 to come to school .  She wa nts to talk to 
her.  I said, well why we  
didn't do anything.  She sai
d, no, no, it's  okay, I just wa nt to
 talk to your 
mother .  My mother  came  t o  sc hool and the  princi pal  sai d 
t o  her be fore  we  go on with our  
conversation and why I calle
d you, she said I wa nt 
you to know I k
now you're Jewish.  My mo ther  
denied it up and down.  
She  said " you ha ve  no pr oof, what  do
 you me an I'm Jewi
sh."   Meanwhile  
don't forget she still had 
the yellow identity ca
rd.  We were just 
lucky up to this po
int.  Finally the  
princi pal  se e me d t o convi nce  her  t hat she  was  to be
 trusted.  My mother br
oke down and di d te ll he r  
that we were Jewi
sh.  She s aid, l ook sh
e  sa ys  I  want to he lp
 you.  And she  tells
 her the story about 
my  sister.  And also at th
at poi nt, j ust  about  tha t  t i me  people  st
arted being c aught  in Br ussels  al rea dy 
too, not as much as 
in Antwerp.  Let me just go 
back.  Okay let me fi nish 
this and then I'll go back 
to Ant w erp.  There was somet hing 
that happened right after we came
 to Brussel s.  She says "I 'm 
goi ng t o hel p.  I  thi nk it 's ti me," s h
e says  " t hat your chil dre n be hidd
en.  I t 's not sa fe
 for them to be 
in school.  It's not safe
 for them to be wi
th you."  She says, 
" I will put you in 
touch with someone 
who can help you."  Before I go on 
with this, let me just
 go back.  After we were in Brussels, my 
mo ther didn't question Carl, she ju
st acted.  And this wa
s basically wh at she di d mo st of the time  
throughout t he wa r.  Whether it  
wa s just l
uc k or my mot her 's ac
tions in themselv
es , I t hink he r  
acting quickly without hesitation, 
wit hout ponderi ng di d hel p a l ot 
in our being save
d.  Of course , 
not minimizi
ng the work of the people who 
helped us, all thos
e righteous Ge
ntiles which I 
will tell 
you about later on.  After 
we got to Brussels and we
 were  set tled down, a bou
t 48 hour s or so later  
Mother s uddenly starte d t hinking about what Carl 
s aid, about ge tting out of 
t own a nd why.  She sai d  
to me , "you know what Fl
orika ,"  s he called me  by my di mi nuti ve na
me ,"  you're going 
t o go ba ck to  
Antwerp and you're going to warn 
people.  You're going to see so
-a nd- so and you'r e going t o t e ll 
them that something is go
ing t o  ha ppen."   She  sa id  " bec aus e
 a child is not de
te cte d you can go  
sa fel y."   Bei ng I wa sn't wea r ing a  
st ar anymore a chil d at t hat poi nt did not  carr y doc ume nts  ye t.  So 
I went bac k to Ant werp, bought a  ti
c ket and went  ba ck to
 Antwer p.  I walked 
into the Langakivicz 
Stra dt [ph89] and i t  wa s very quie
t.  I didn't  se e a n ybody.  The but
cher shop was clos
e d, the ba ker y 
was cl osed.  It reall y was al most
 frightening.  There 
I wa s wal k ing t hr ough t hese  stre ets  and I didn't 
see anybody.  I 
sa w pe op le in the Pellicon St
radt [ph92] which was where t h
e  stati on was.  Ther e  it  
wa s ver y  ac tive;   pe ople  were  
comi ng, people were go
ing; t he  tra ms  we re ope rating.  Howe ver , 
onc e I walked into the Langakivicz Stra dt [ph94]
 and the Leverick Stra
dt [ph92] a n d the Some r 

Stra dt [ph92] it wa s very, very quiet.
  I  wal ke d ar ound.  I was a fraid 
t o go ba ck to Br us sel s bec ause I  
hadn't carried out what Mom told me
 to do.  Finally it wa
s getting to be late af
ternoon.  It wasn't  
quite  dusk but I c oul d s e e the sun 
st a r ting t o go under  and 
I di dn't know what t o
 do, whether to go 
bac k or not .  And a s I wa s walki ng trying to de ci
de whether  to ba ck t o t he sta tion to go bac k to  
Brussels, I heard a knock near my
 ankle from a baseme nt wi ndow. 
 I l ooked down and a  ha nd was  
poi nting t o one  si de of t he street
.  I knew exactl y what 
they were showing me, to come in.  So I 
we nt t o whe r e I k ne w ho w t o g e
t t hrough the la byrinth 
[thi s was on t he Some
r  St radt [ph104] and I  
ma de  my way i nto that base me nt
.  The r e we re fi ve pe ople  i n th
e bas e ment.  One of the m was  a  
dista nt cousi n of M o m's t hrough ma
rr iage .  And I  said Ch
anita, Mama said you sh
ould all leave.  I 
said what ha ppe ne d, whe r e is  e ver y
body?   And they told me  that they ca me in with big trucks and 
literally emp tied the neighbo
rhood.  That was pr
obably the thing that Carl wa
rned us abou
t.  I told 
those people to come with 
me to Br ussels.  They sa
id no, t her e 's no pl ace to
 run, we have food for 
about t hre e wee ks , we 're  not goi ng a nywhere .  I neve
r saw them again.  I le
ft and I never saw t he m 
agai n.  I  we nt  ba ck t o  Bruss els
.  My Mom,  who died April 7, 
1992 her wh ole life
 she carr ied a 
terrible  bur den of guilt  for not  havi
ng told people before
 she left.  However wh
en Carl  tol d her  a nd 
she  kept  t elli ng me  t his  her whol e  li fe  her  i m me di
ate reaction was to follow 
hi s  dir ecti ons , ta ke  her 
children and go.  Sh e did 
not  even t hink or  ponder  as t o  what
 might happen.  But afterwar ds it 
bot here d her .  Let  me  jus t  tell yo
u one mor e t hing about  what  happ
ened in Antwerp before we  had 
left for Brussels and befo
re Carl  had warned my mother .  I found out after the war that  the Belgian 
Naz i s i n Antwer p had gathere d one night a nd 
had been shown a fil m, 
"De Avaga Juda[ph123]"  
which is the "Eternal  Jew" which is a horri ble film
 wh ere human beings are tr
ansposed i nto rat s  an d 
back and forth.  The film is s
till available now and I 
understand in South Am
erica it's still being  
shown.  One day a horde of
 Belgian Nazis stormed into
 our street, I'll ne ver fo
rget it, we  were in our 
apart me nt  looki ng out our window. 
 The  one  thing t hat  we we re a b
le to see fr om our window wa s 
them breaking the window of the 
book s hop acr os s the  stre et a nd 
t hrowi ng the books  
and everyt hi n g  
into the street and 
stomping them and dragging 
out  t he  ol d ma n;  he  ha d paye s[ph131], he  had bear d;  
this was a religious old 
ma n and beating him up an
d stomping him with thei
r boots and al
l.  I'll 
never forget  the sight .  
My middle  sister  got  hyste
rical.  I had to slap her 
face to get her to stop 
screaming, "Charlotte, Ch
arlot t e."   Also I  witness ed t he bur ni ng 
of the synagogue in
 Antwerp, I'll 
never forget that.  I reme mber t he 
fire  truc ks  sta nding by.  The y we
r e st anding ther e doi ng nothi ng .  
First they threw out the to
rahs and t h
e pra yer  books  a nd the n  the y
 put  it  on fire  and i t  burne d for  
hours.  Not h ing; nobody 
ma de any move to stop t he fir e.  I 
fo und out after the 
war when I went 
bac k, I found out s ubs equentl y t hat t he Bel gians, th
e fir e- fighters were given strict orders not  to  
ma ke  any att e mpt t o
 cont ain t he  fire  unless  it  start e d t ouc hing buildi ngs.
 
 
Do  you reme mb er when this was?
 
 
To the be st of my recoll
ection it was late '41.  I 
have it upstairs 
writt en down so I  ca n give  you t he  
date .  I f  you wa nt  I ca n fi ll t hat  in
 at a later time.  I th
ink that was late '41 if
 I ' m no t mi stake n  b ut  I  
will give you the correct date.  
I have it written down 
somewhere upstai
rs.  I'm glad now that I 
wr ote down a lot  of t hings becaus
e  my me mo ry  i n  s mall  
detail is starting to go,
 I  notice d .  Al though 

I 'm still  ver y  confi dent  because 
many thi ngs t hat  I ' m not  sure of
 somet i mes keep being confir med 
that  my  me mo ry  is  g oo d,  ma ny  de

fr om Fat her  Bruno Re ynde rs, is  
confir mi ng ma ny detail s t hat  I 
had  i n  my  me mory  so  I  feel  ple a
sed about that.  But anyway coming 
back to Br ussels, to the Mother  
Superi or, we  we nt home  that  day 
and she did put us
 in touch with a Mssr. 
Georges  Rans on.  I  have  
his  phot ogra ph.  I 've  c orr esponded 
wi th hi m.  I we nt bac k ther e  a fte
r the wa r to see hi m.   I've got  a 
wonder ful  postcard t hat 
he wrot e me , inc r edi ble Sha r on.  An
yway, Ms sr. Ra nson wa s a me mber of  
a gr oup tha t  was  our s chool 's patr ons .  Her e 
we  h a ve  PT A's,  PT SA's .  In  Bel gi u m we  h a d  
industrial ists, some of t h e wealt h
ier  me mber s of the t o wn who woul

They would help out with things
 a  sc hool  would need,  t hey we
r e especiall y  inst rument al  in  
providi ng vi ta mi ns , wi nt er cl othe s a nd hel p wit h
 se nding c hildre n t o ca mp
s li ke  the  one we  ha d  
bee n i n, in 1940.  And Mssr . Ra nson
, as I sai d, wa s i nstr u mental  in 
this.  At  that par ticular  ti me , 
somet hing I  didn't  know until  late r on, M ssr . 
Ra ns on wa s an acti ve me mber of the Bel gia n 
Resistance.  He  had a factory that ma de  mica for, 
I don't know wh et
her  the y were  use d  in guns  or  
some  ki nd of armor, for the German army.  
But  in hi s  cell ar a t  night  they pr oduce d a nd  
manufact ured guns for  the Resi st
ance .  M ssr . Ra ns on ha d a c ousin 
who was  a nun i n a c onvent  in a  
small town named Doel in the Fle mis
h part of Belgium.  He got in 
contact  wit h hi s cousin and t ol d  
her t hat he had t hree chil dren wh
o ne ede d a hidi ng pl ace .  She wa
s more  than ha ppy t o help out . 
She  di d not  tell t he  Mot her  Superior  t hat  we  wer e 
Jewish children.  She told the Mother  Superior 
that three children whose father 
was a prisoner of war and whose 
mother had beco
me ill needed a  
shelte r for  a short  per i od of ti me
.  The evening before our departur
e Mssr. Ra nson picked us up and 
he s plit  us  up.  I stayed at hi s home , my si ster Charlotte  sta ye d
 in hi s brot her 's ho
me  a nd my  sister  
Bett y st ayed in hi s secret ary's hom
e .  His  br oth e r wa s a gain st wh at
 he wa s doi ng bec a us e he  worri ed  
about t he fa mil y 's well- being.  Howe ver, he  di d ob
ey his  br ot her a nd hel p ed s helt er us .  I found out 
later on that he also sheltered a 
fa mily in an attic thro
ughout the war.  He to
ok care of
 them, fe d 
the m, etc .  Mr. Ra ns on the next  mor ning pers ona lly 
tra ns port ed us and I 'll  
tell you how.  But first I 
want t o shar e with you a small  det a
il of the evening that
 I wa s in hi s home.  
Naturally, needless to  
say we  were  ki nd of fri g htened
 of be ing se para te d fr om Mom a
nd all  that.  Act uall y  what  was 
strange is that for some 
reason, even though we wer e
 young in years, we  seem
e d t o unde rstand what  
this was all about a
nd we didn't cry, did wh at we were told
 t o do;  we  we re what  we  called good  
childr en.  And why a m I sayi ng 
good c hildren beca use eve n chil
dre n who wer e hidde n had t o  
behave  a c er t ain wa y.  Childre n who wer e not good 
chil dre n, who create d proble ms , were not ke pt.  
So eve n to be hidde n one  had t o be a good c hild 
s o our be ne fa ctors ha d no proble ms with us.  So 
anyway we were three good  children.  I reme mb
e r  Mss r. Rans on put ting me 
to be d and kis sing me  
good-night, then leaving 
and closing the door.  
A little while later I hear
d an argument between  
Mssr
. Ra nson a nd his wi fe .  She  was screa mi ng, " you
're  cra zy, you're ma d.  A
ll t hose t hings you'r e  
doi ng,"  she s ays , " you ca n do whate v
er you want .  You want  t o ri sk yo
ur  li fe , that 's  fi ne ," she says, 
"but  you ha ve no ri ght  t o bring th
is child here to risk 
my life  and the children
's  li ves  beca use  of a  
couple of Jews."  I remember layi
ng there, my heart st arting t o beat
, getti ng ver y  upse t, starti ng to 
cry, the n le aving my 
bed, runni ng into t he other room sh
outing, " Mssr . Ranson, Mssr . Ranso n  
pleas e ta ke me  ba ck, I don't want
 to create pr oble ms  bet w een you 
and M rs . Ranson," M me Ra nso n, 
of c ourse , i n  Fre nch.  I 'll  never 
forget it.  Mssr. Ranson
 was qui et for a second
 and suddenly pointed 
his hand and said," you get your se
lf back to bed imme diat ement," " 
ret our ne a u lit ," i n  Fre nc h, but 

wit h a voic e  that c ould i mpos e nothi ng el se but obe
die nce .  And I went bac k
 to be d and l a y t her e  
trembling not even daring 
to cry anymore.  It wa
s quiet  a ft er war ds .  Anywa y at da wn ver y, ve ry 
early in the morning, Mss
r. Ranson woke me 
and he had a little 
flat bed truck and I sat on it with 
hi m and we we nt to pic k up 
my sist er and t he t hird sister .  He ha
d pr epared t he back 
of t h e truc k in a  
very i nter est ing wa y.  He ha d gotte n vegetabl e c r at
es , the type of crate s that wer e us ed, woode n  
crates  tha t  st ored ve get ables a nd fruit .   He ha d 
turned three of them upsi
de  down, t he y wer e e mpty, 
and around i t  and on top of the m he
 had put filled crates with vegeta
ble s and fruit .  Apparentl y he  
must ha ve gone  out be fore he  wo
ke me to take me be
cause the tr uck 
was all ready.  And after w e  
had picked up t he  t h
ird s i ster  he  put  e ach one  of us under  
the empty crate and covered us  with the 
other  crat es and he t ol d us t hat
 under  no circ umst ance s were  we t o
 ma ke any sound, t hat he woul d 
stop, knock on t he c r ate and t a
ke the crate off t o l et us go to t h e 
bat hroom i n an appropr iate pl ace, to  
fe ed us , give  us a drink, 
e t c.  But unl e ss he did so he didn't  wa nt
 to hear a sound. 
 Now you have  to 
picture Betty.  Betty wa s at
 that point barely 
six years old.  I don't even know
 if she wa s six.  I think 
so bec aus e I  think t his 
was in the spring. 
 She  was  quiet , it  was  a mazing, s he  was qui et.  And Betty 
basically was not a quiet 
chil d, she had a big mout h.  Charl otte 
was a quiet child 
at all times.  
Charlott e sucked her t humb and wo
uld crawl into a corner even at
 home, wo uld neve
r  reall y speak 
up.  She was upset, she wo
uld just crawl into he
r little corner.  Anyway, 
we reme mber the truck  
stopping at chec kpoint s beca use  
at  t hat poi nt there wer e checkpoi
nts at  the edge of every cit y,  
be for e you l eft  the cit y.  And the  Ge r ma ns  as king
 for hi s docume nt
s, I r e me mbe r  at  one  point  he  
aske d, " Doc ument en," a nd he s howe d hi s doc u ment
 a nd ever ythi ng was i n or
der .  And then t he y  
asked him, I reme
mbered him asking wh
at he had there and 
telling the m that th
ey could see it was 
vegetabl es , i t  wa s fr uit.  And t h
en the i r comi ng and sort of knocki
ng a nd l o oki ng a round and let ting 
us go.  I 'll never for get a nd I  tell t his  to e ver yone
 I talk to because it stil
l a ma z es me .  I  re me mb e r  
havi ng at  one of t hos e c hec kpoints  a  tickle i n  
my t hroat a nd re me mberi n g havi ng t o cough a nd 
thinking if I don't cough I will 
choke.  However also 
knowing I ma y choke a
nd die and don't cough  
but also knowing that if 
I coughed I would betray 
everyone and they would 
be killed and I would be  
killed because we were to
ld that if we make 
one sound not onl
y would we be 
killed but Mssr. 
Ranson would be killed and ev
erybody else would be
 killed.  I di
dn't know at the time ho w 
everybody else 
was going to be killed.  Of 
course today I realize they pr
obably would have tortured 
Mssr . Ranson and gott e n t he  infor m
ati o
n fr om hi m or  eve n fr om
 us.  But  a nywa y some how, 
unbelie vabl y, so I  did not c ough a
nd to this day I have 
an exer cise that  I  do
 every once i n  a whil e 
ma ybe t o re a ssur e mysel f  th
at I can do it, if I have a tickle in
 my throat I'll hol
d off coughing for a  
fe w minutes .   It s ounds  si lly.  Here 's t his mi ddl e a g
ed woma n who gets a ti ckle
 in her throat  once in 
a while and tends to 
wait  and not c ough.  That  I did a nd I  di
dn't c ough and I sur v
ived t h e tickl e.  I  
coughed once I heard the tr
uck really rolling. 
 I do the same ex
ercise once in a wh
ile with students  
of mi ne.  I l et the m try because 
t he ki ds will  cough occasi onal l y 
when someone's tal king and I  sa y 
okay, if anybody needs to
 cough see if you can ho
ld out a couple of mi nut
es.  It'll help you. 
Anywa y, it wa s se rious.  It sounds
 funny but it  was prett y seriou
s at the time.  We  get to the  
mona ster y.  It turned out  
that we wer e goi ng to be
 three only kids there 
with about a hundred and 
twenty nuns because it ha d been a 
boarding school.  But because of 
the war there were
 no students 
at the school .
 
 

Co uld you tell me where it was?
 
 
That wa s Do el, I mentioned 
that , that was where Sister  Odonia, Ms
sr. Ra ns on's  cousi n  wa s.  It  was  
right near the beach.  
As  a ma tter of fa ct ther
e's a big monument now right
 near the water within 
walking distance of this 
convent in honor of British
 soldiers who were killed 
there in a battle.  It was  
that close to the battle sc
e nes .  Toda y also there 's  a  
nuclear plant there.  The to
wn is totally deserted.  
I went  back and even the 
convent  moved.  It 's e m pt
y because a nuclear plant si
ts right in that town. 
We  arrived and we were 
placed in a parlor waiting 
for the Mother Superior 
to come in and Sister  
Odonia to come an
d we were sitting there with 
a nun who was not Sister O
donia kind of keeping us 
company till the others woul
d arrive.  And then
 finally they arrived and we
 were sitting there with  
several nuns, the Mother Superior 
and Sister Odonia.  As we were 
sitting, my younge
r sister looked 
up and noticed a cross on th
e wall.  And being Jewish children we 
gr ew up ha ving to hold our hea d s 
do wn  wh en we  cro sse d a 
church.  We  had never been in a c
hur ch be ca use  we wer e n't  allowed t o  
enter  a chur ch and of co
urse  we  ha d never bee n i nside a bui
l d ing wher e a cros s wa s ha ngi ng on a  
wall .  So t here we are and suddenl y
 Bett y's ga ze we nt up to
 t his cr oss and she sa
id to the nun, "what 
is that ."  And the  nun l o oks at her a n d sai d very 
surpri sed, ---no t he Mother 
Supe rior wa sn't in t he  
room yet, she ca me in afterwards, 
I'll never forget that. 
and she said, " of course
 little one this is our 
Lor d  on the  cr oss ,"  s he  says ,"  yo
u mu st have one like th
at at home , too."  
And she said "no we  
don't ."  The n  she said, " 
well you mu st ha ve one wh
ere you go and pr ay a t  
chur ch."  And s he says, 
"no we  don't, we have somethi
ng else ."   Meanwhile I wa s becomi
ng very concerned 
a nd I  s at ne xt  
to Bett y a nd I start ed pi nc hing her under the ta ble 
t o be quiet .  She  kne w that whe n she  wa s pi nc he d 
she ha d t o be quiet .  It  wa s a  co
de t hat we  had.  At  thi s poi nt, 
however, she chose 
not  to obey me  
and says "leave me alone,
 don't hur t me, I ' m not doing anyt hing." 
 And she s a ys , "  we
ll I don't  know 
what  it 's call ed but i f you give 
me  a pencil and paper 
I 'll  s h ow you wha t  we  have " a nd s he  got  a  
pencil a nd paper .  She  drew the mos t  per fe ct 
M a gen Davi d, t he Je wi sh st ar.  The nun be ca me  
hyst erical , j u mped out of her seat , ra n out of the  
parl or a nd all of a s udden the Mot her Superi or  
came  in and who I later 
found out wa s Si ster Od
onia came in with her 
and there was this big 
argume nt going on.  
I know now and I found out 
soon a ft er t h at Si ster Odonia ha d ne ver t old t he  
Mother Superior that
 we were Jewish children as I said before.  She just said we were children 
whos e fat her  was  a pris oner-of-
war  a n d we  ne ede d a s helter .
 
 
Wh at language did you speak...?
 
 
Okay we spoke both Fre n ch a nd Fle mi sh, however ,  
they were speaking Fl em
ish.  This was going on 
in Flemish.
 
 
I was  wonde ring like a ft e
r you left  An twerp...?
 
 

In Br ussels we  spoke Fr ench.  We  
spoke French i n Br usse
ls.  To this day in 
Belgium you have thre e 
langua ges , you have Fle mis h, Fren
c h and Wa lloon.  I n th
e French speaki ng part of t h e countr y, in 
school, only French is ta
ught.  Howe ver, in the Flemish part 
of Belgium both la
nguages are taught , 
Fle mi sh and Fre nch.  Thi s is  a not he
r thing that  the Fl emish resent to this day; they feel like they'r e 
second-class citizens.  Their langua
ge does not have 
to be taught in the Fren
ch part but 
the Flemish 
have to s pea k Fr enc h.  As a matter 
of fa ct, you'll go into many small 
towns, if you attempt to ask an  
addr ess  or  somet hing i n Frenc h, ev
en if they know French, they'll 
pret end not to under sta nd Fre nc h.  
Anyway this was in Flemis
h.  This was really
 in the heart of Fl emish Belgium.  They had a dilemma 
now.   They didn't know wh at to do
.  The y did ke ep us , howe ver; t he y did ke ep us .  We di dn't sta y 
too long.  We  st ayed a 
little short  of t wo months  there because what  ha
ppened i s the Mother  
Superi or, not  bec aus e s he  wa s a  ba d 
person, she was re ally a good pers
on, she was afraid
 to ke ep us  
because it was a real tiny to
wn.  And when I went back I fi rst re
alized how small it
 reall y was. 
There was just the one church.  Y
ou c oul d walk ac ross t he whole town 
within less than
 an hour and 
a half to two hours.
  And there was a German pos
t there.  Not a Ge
stapo post, it was a mi litary post ,  
a small one.  But still, th
e nuns, because of the war 
and the draft, they usua
lly had a chaplain.  But 
during the war the village priest do
ubled as chaplain so 
instead of having mass 
within the convent in 
their chapel, the nuns we nt  to th
e vill age chur ch for mass.  One of
 t he pr oble ms  that
 they realized 
they woul d have i s wit h  me , the  
olde st, be cause  I  was  ol d enough 
t o ha ve  gone to Communi on, t o  
have ha d my first  Comm
union and to go 
t o  Communi on whenever  t her
e was mass, especially on 
Sunda ys .  And of course  I c oul dn't
 go to Communion now that they 
found out I wa s Je
wis h,  so  t he y  
couldn't let me go to
 Communion.  They were, however, very 
very good to us.  
They knitted socks. 
The y wer e a s kind a s could be, espe cially Sist er
 Od oni a wh o  wa s with us  
almost constantly.  We  
were really spoiled because we 
were like their three little pets fo
r the two months that we were  
there .  Anywa y a f ter t w o mont hs George Ra ns on ca
me bac k  and t ook us  ba
ck to my mother's the 
sa me  way t h at he  br ought us.  Fo
r a few days here
 and there we  st ayed with hi m and the secretary 
and the  br ot her a gai n but we were  ba ck wit h my mo
ther .  He ma de some  ot
her  conta ct s for  us  and 
they found us another pla
ce.  I realize today that 
the other  pl ace t hat  we we
re hidden in
 wa s through 
Fat her  Bruno a lthough I  had al wa ys
 bee n under  t he i mpre ssi on t hat  
the only plac e t hat  he ha d bee n 
responsible for was the last hidi
ng place in Ruisselede but I now 
know that Etterbeek was also 
through Fat h er Bruno.  We  were  
hi dden in Ett
erbeek i n St . J o seph'
s Orphanage but it
 was really not 
onl y a n orphana ge; t he y also ha d some  youngste rs 
who wer e  di ffi cult  to d
eal  with.  Someone sai d 
they we re  juvenil e  deli nquent s. 
 We wer e ther e for  about  eight mo
nths  a nd a ft er  eight mont hs  we  
we nt back home and a new 
pl ace  ha d to be  found.
 
 
Co uld you tell me what
 it was like there?
 
 
That 's exactl y what  I 'm goin
g to do ri ght now.  Ett erbee k wa s a  ve
ry di fficul t place fo
r us to be.  The  
little ones went to classes. 
 I was recruited to peel 
potatoes and help with 
the kitchen and with the  
cooking and things like that, to 
repair socks, and help
 with the little ones b
ecause I was one of the  
older  c hildr e n.
 
 

What  were  you like  t w
el ve at  that  ti me?
 
 
At  tha t  poi nt  I was  t welve, i t  wa s j ust  be fore  t wel
ve, yeah I think I might ha
ve been just twelve at 
that poi nt because I  thi nk we wer e
 ther e, we went t here l ike i n 
Jul y and stayed t hroughout t he 
period, past  t wel ve .  The  place  wa
s di rty, I reme mber.  I re member 
there wa s a garden but there wa s 
a big, almost like a - I thought it
 was a ten fo ot fence 
but it could be because 
I was little.  And there 
wer e a pple s growi ng t her e and of 
course we  couldn't get 
in there.  But there 
was a smal l courtyar d  
in the or phanage.  We sl ept i n a dor
mit ory.  I  we nt back to
 visit it.  On my  seco
nd vi sit I fi nall y ra ng 
the bell, on the first visit, 
I couldn't br ing mysel f t o ring the be ll, 
I 'll  ne ver forget  that .  I don't know 
why.  I ne ve r found an a ns wer t o
 t ha t .  But the s econd ti me  I  did 
ring t he  bell t o go i n a nd I  was  
received ver y war mly.  There were j ust  t wo people 
l e ft  of t he ones that  I  
knew.  But  anyway ther e 
were rats, but then there were rats
 al l over Bel gi u m at  that  point 
bec ause  things  were  dirt y, t hings  
coul dn't be kept up.  An
d I remember there was a lo
t of wate r, the ba se ment was  al ways fl oode d.  
And I  re me mber, being one  
of the ol der kids, I had t o go hel p 
chase t he r ats.  Bu
t anyway bathing 
wa s a proble m.  The y woul d set  up
 a bi g tub i n the mi ddle  of t he 
courtya r d, of c our se  not in t he  
winter mo nths, and we t
ook tur ns  going i nto t he  
tub, washing, go
ing out of the 
tub and getting a 
towel t hat was used by at least 
ten or  more kids, and dr ying.  A
nd I 'll ne ver forget it, my mi ddl e  
sister , Charl otte, wa s ver y fi nic ky a n d she  re fus e d t o
 go into the tub.  An
yway s he  fi nally did but  
they had to practically force her 
to go in.  So these 
ki nds  of things.  Anothe r t hi ng tha t I  do 
re me mb er fr o m t here  is  my  mo th
er did oc casi onally vis it t he re be
ca use  it  was a Br
ussels suburb , 
Etterbeek, so she did occa
sionally visit and bring a 
little bread.  The bread I'll
 never forget.  It was 
war  brea d.  The  fi rst  da y i t  was  
tough.  The  sec ond da y it was even to
ugher  a nd the t hird da y i t  
starte d goi ng mol dy.  It  wa s hea vy, but it  wa s bre a d.  Eve n a t  Etter bee k at the or pha na ge we  would  
get a piece of br ead that we  had to
 sa ve  and we woul d onl y ge t it  ev
ery t hr ee da ys  or  s o.  So I wa s  
responsible for t he bread of my si
ste r s.  I  slept  wi th t he  br ea d und
er my  pillow with one eye half 
ope n I woul d al most s a y, never sl e eping very well 
bec aus e kids woul d ste al from one anothe r. 
There would be battles during the 
night with the kids; they would 
try to steal the bread.  Anothe r 
problem I had with the bread was I 
had to divide it between the thre
e of us and hold 
it.  The littl e  
one  di dn't quite underst a nd t hat  I didn't want  to gi
ve her t he  bread be cause  I 
needed i t for t he next 
day and the next day.  An
d she al ways cri ed that 
I ' m be ing me a n a nd s el fis
h and I wouldn't give her 
the brea d.  I  als o nee ded bre ad for  a not her r eas o
n.  We  e nde d up ha ving lice a nd I woul d ta ke  th e  
lice out of my sisters' he
a ds but I  coul dn't ta ke my
 own out so I  paid for i t
 by the brea d for ever y te n 
lice.  I measured the br
ead and the other kids wh
o took my lice out had to 
literally show me every 
louse that was killed, actually the 
nit s
 that t he y woul d ta ke out.  
I counte d the m very di ligent l y a nd 
there ha d to be te n.  Ten for a b
ite of brea d a nd t h e bre a d wa s me as
ured exactly from t h e nail on my  
thumb to my knuckle. 
 So that wa s one
 thi ng.  I  ha d t o hel p  cook as
 I s aid be fore a nd I c oul dn't 
underst and.  I us ed t o get ver y
 ill  a nd vomit  someti
mes an d  the n ma ny year
s later when I was 
already in the Unit ed St ates, I 
r e member t hat  when I  smell ed co
oked rhubarb, be
ca use  Mom love d 
cooking rhubarb, I wo uld f
eel  nauseated.  I  r ecal led the reason
 per ha ps  why this  ha ppene d was  one 
of t he  vegeta bles  t hat  we  had while  we wer e at  Et
t erbeek we used to cook 
the leaves of the rhub arb 
rather t han j ust t he st ems and I learned si nce t hat  the le ave s of r hubar b ha ve a t oxi n in the m, not  
enough to kill one but enough 
to render one quite ill.  
Of course at the time 
we didn't know it and 

ever ythi ng t hat we c oul d e at, we 
at e.  We even co
oked the leaves of carrots
.  I use d t o s t eal , of  
course.  I stole potatoes for my  
kid sisters all while I 
wa s peel ing t he m.  And 
we ate t he peels whil e 
we were peeling them
 be caus e t hat  was goi ng to be food, got  
ground into food.  
So  t h ey were no t 
the ea sies t ei ght mont hs .  However , I r e me mbe r  the r
e bei ng a fe w nuns who se
emed to me that the y  
were a little different from 
the other nuns.  I can't 
quite remember wh
at struck me a
bout their being 
di ffere nt.  One of the m i n partic ular , she  was  mu
ch strict er t h an t he ot he
r  nuns were.  I found out  
aft er t he war  when I went back th
at those were Jewish young wo me
n who were also hiding in the  
orphanage, but since they 
were adults, they were dr
essed up in the nuns' habit.
  Ther efore I  r ealized 
somet hing but I  di dn't quite
 understand it at the ti
me.  I l earned all  these th
ings  when I we nt bac k. 
Anyway, after about 
eight monthsthings
 were getting pretty dangerous
 there also.  We had some  
visits from the Gestapo but things
 were still fairly safe.  But an
yway we were ve
ry unhappy there 
and Mama  said that she had ma de  
a cont act  and perhaps we coul d find
 a not her  pla ce.  So we  wer e  
take n home .  We wer e home  for  a whil e.  Mea n whil e 
my aunt a n d uncle 's apa r t me nt ha d been r aide d  
and my  aunt and uncle ha
d moved into our apartm
ent so we we re  all, 
my aunt  a n d uncle  a nd 
Nat ha n, we called Noonoo.  Mea n
while while all this 
wa s going on, M s sr. Ra
ns on had provided  
Mom with a  cr oss  fr om hi
s  wi fe , ha d provi ded her wit h  fals e  
documents under the name  of Fi ers 
wit h a r egula r gree n c ard whi ch he di d for othe r pe opl
e  als o.  And he gave Mom 
a  job a t his fact ory.  
But between the job at the fact ory just before 
that, Mom had wo rked - we
 had friends who lived 
right  acr oss  t he e l e me ntar y s chool  that  we had go
ne to, Ricard Premier[ph
489], and for a mo me nt I 
can't think of their name, 
it'll come to me, I wrote 
i t  do w n s o me wh ere , it 'll c o me bac k to  me , ma yb e  
I could fill it in to yo
u la t er on.  For s o me re ason I 'm dr a win
g a bla nk all of a  
sudden -  oh no, Mr . 
and Mrs . Hotton.  The y  ha d a n old metal scra p ya
rd.  Wh en we first me
t the m, we  were good 
friends, but since at  the time Mama took any ki nd
 of work, before Mssr. 
Ra nson ga ve  her  t he j ob 
and a false document, she worked fo
r the m as a cleaning wo
man.  They also he
lped her with a little 
bit of food a nd t o bring 
bac k for  my aunt a nd un
cle.  However, Mssr . an
d M me . Hot t on's son ha d 
joined the Black Shirts.  
He  didn't  li ve  with t he m but  he  di d 
visit  occ as i onall y.  Aft er a while  s o  
Mom shoul dn't ha ve t o walk t he str
eet s back and forth to the apart m
e nt, M o m e nde d up slee ping i n  
Mssr . and Mme Hotton's 
attic.  But then they t old
 her  maybe she'd be bett
er off not  co
ming anymore 
and sleepi ng ther e because t hey we
re afrai d t heir son just mi ght fi
nd out  a nd woul d be tray her .  So 
she stoppe d goi ng.  I we nt 
back after the war .
  Ms
sr. Hotton ha d di ed a nd I we nt t o se e M me Hott on  
but perhaps because of age she di
d not recognize me , and I was a 
little saddened because of that 
beca use  I di d go back t o  see her.
  But anyway she the n got t h e jo
b with Mssr . Ranson.  Then l ate r  
on, a fter  we  wer e hi dde n agai n and 
I'll tell you the deta
il s of t ha t, Mssr. Ra ns
on provided Mom with  
sleeping accommodations in 
his office in the fa ctory.
  She would leave at ab
out fi ve  o'cloc k, lea ve  
wo rk like everybody else and then
 she woul d hi de i n......We ll, there  are  se vera l  thi ngs  t hat  
happe ned.  Mssr . Ranson provi ded her wit h  a  c ot  whi c
h wa s kept  i n  a  cl oset  in
 his office.  He  al so 
brought her food.  He  took her 
l aundr y t o his apart me nt  a nd beli
eve  i t  or  not his wi fe  di d my  
mother 's  laundr y.  Some  of it  she 
did in the factory, but 
the things that she c
oul dn't do, s he did .  
With all that she still help
ed him.  But anyway, he
 also brought her food to
 take to my aunt and 
uncle because after their apartment had been raided
 and t hey ended 
up sta ying i n our apart me nt ,  
they never l e ft  our  apart m
ent anymore.  Th ey never 
went  out  in t he  stre et  ag
ain.  So she took them 
food so t hat  they woul d 
be well  suppli ed.  And s he  would sne a k 
back to t he factor y and sleep i n  the 
factor y.  So she l e ft with ever yb
ody.  She then sn
uck bac k a ft er dar k.  Af
ter she took the food and 

then snuc k bac k a nd had a  ke y t o  ente r.  Th
ere ar e al so people wor king downst airs for t he 
Res i sta nce  t hroughout al l thi s peri
od  o f ti me  an d  so meti me s  s he hel pe d
 out with that. 
 At  thi s  poi nt  
my a unt  is  in our  apart me nt, 
Mom is sleeping in Ra
ns on's  fact ory and we
 get contacted by a 
repre sent ative from Fathe r Br uno. 
 The per son never ga ve  her  na me . 
 The one thing that it is they  
did not give their names because of
 fe ar that if their 
network got infiltrated
 and betrayed there 
would be  a proble m.  But anywa y, t hat t here i s a  
place wher e they could hide
 us and t hey ga ve us  
very precise instru
ctions.  My aunt's child, 
Noonoo, my little co
usin Noonoo, was 
also offered a 
hidi ng place .  My a unt  wa s a frai d  t o let  hi m go 
because at  that  point  so
me  of the groups were  
infiltrated by traitors 
and sometimes children were
 picked up, taken away
, and were never seen 
agai n.  And t hey wer e aware of th
at; the Je ws  were aware 
of that.  My aunt de
ci ded t hat  her  Noonoo 
had a 50% cha nce of s u rvivi ng i n t h is nei ghbor h
ood  But anyway to ma ke
 a long stor y short my  
uncle and aunt were ta
ken to Auschwitz.  My 
aunt and my little
 cousin were destroyed in  
Ausc hwitz.  So he  was born dur ing 
the war a nd he  got  kill ed during 
the wa r.  M y unc le survi ve d but  
he met an ugly death in Poland afte
r  li berati on.  M y mot her  wa s supp
ose d  t o take  us
; she took us to 
the t r ain st at ion.  We we
re supposed to go 
on the quai, wait at a part
i cula r  trai n for a woma n who 
wa s de scri be d as we aring a parti cul ar suit, a partic ul
ar c olor , a nd we were not t o a ddre ss her.  My  
mother  wa s not  to a ddr es s 
her.  We  were j ust  t o 
wait until the train pulled in
.  Then the train pulled 
in.  Wh en this woma
n who wa s de scr i bed t o us ve ry di stinc tly
 walked into the tr
ain, the three of us 
had to walk awa y fr om my mot her  wit hout sa yi ng 
goodbye  as i f she  wer e 
a stranger, without any 
acknowle dge ment t hat we kne w he r.
  Wherever t h e woman sat  down 
we were supposed to sit dow n  
without acknowledging that there 
was any connection betw
een us and the woman.
  I'm still amazed 
at times that we did it, 
but we  di d.  Where ver  th
e wo ma n would get off the 
trai n, we  woul d foll ow  
her, not t o a d dres s her or anyt hing els e.  We foll ow
ed her.  When we were 
several  stre e t s a wa y fr om 
the station, and that 
was  Rui ssel ede  a s we  le arne d late r on, sh
e  ca me  over, took us  ar ound a nd sai d  
I 'm gong t o take you t o a sa fe  pl ace .  We t he n
 e nde d up a t  t he Conven
t of Our Lady of Se ven 
Sorrows, Notre Da me  de Se pt Doul
eurs.  There we  stayed till liber
ation.  After several months, I 
received a coded l etter fr om my mot h
er.  The Mother Super ior called me
 int o  her office and read me  
the letter.  The le
tter  said, Dearest  Flor a, Tant a Leah, Un
cle Alex and Noonoo went  away on 
vacati on to visit the rest of t he fa
mily.  I don't know
 when they'll be back.  
I don't  know what t o do  
in the meantime.  The Mo
ther Superior handed me t he l ett er
 whic h s h e ha d opene d and alr eady 
read, sa id what is  thi s s a ying.  I 
said I think what it's
 
sayi ng is  that my aunt
 and uncle wer e caught  
by t he ge sta po and were  take n a wa y 
t o a concentr ation cam
p.  Because by then we
 kne w.  We  di dn't  
know exactly what happened
 in concentration camp
s, that we didn't know
 until later on, but we  
kne w at t hat  poi nt t hat t h ey e xis

Herr  Gross had be en taken t o a  
concentrati on camp, so
me how wa s t ake n out  on a  work det ail or  
being transferred to anot
her ca mp a nd he  jump ed fr om t he  trai

wounde d.  They le ft

t h e bushes.  He was 
a good man;  di dn't  
betra y hi m, nurs e d hi m bac k to h

ma de his wa y ba ck t o Br ussel s.  Afte r we  ha d le ft
 Ant werp and we wer e in Br uss els, ac cide ntly we  
onc e met .  And t hat 's how he  kne w  that we wer e 
in Br us sels .  But a nyway he ma de his wa y bac k  
and t hat 's how we lear ned 
some of those things.  He
 did survive and 
then died in the United States a 
fe w ye ars after he emigrated.  He
 was al wa ys a  sick ma
n t hough, for t he re st
 of hi s li fe .  But 
anyway, comi ng  back there, the Mo ther Su perior 
dictat ed a l etter  and I  wr
ote, Dear  Mama, whil e 

Uncle Al ex, Aunt Le ah a nd Noonoo are on vac ati on,
 wh y don't you come to 
vi sit us .  My mother  
came.  She walked a railroad trac
k at  ni ght  not to get  lost , bec a
use by t hen even with fal se 
doc ume nts it  was muc h t oo da nge rous to go on tr
ains , a nd sl e pt under t he  
bushes dur i ng the  day; 
stole from the fiel ds t o su
rvive the three days that 
she walked and came to the convent.  The Mother  
Superior gave her a beauti
ful little room.  But we we
re told that no
body was to know
 that she was 
our mother, t hat she was supposed 
to be a stra nge r .  I f we  sa w he
r we were not t o a cknowle dge he r  
but  every once i n a whil e she would 
take us  to s ee her .  So onc e 
a  we ek she woul d 
t ake  us  very 
quietl y.  Ma ma  would be waiti ng in
 that r oo m a n d we  would go and 
we  wer e a ble  to hug and t al k 
and see each other for about
 a half-hour.  But the rest of the we
ek we  had to stay 
away.  There we re 
a fe w c l os e brus he s bec a use  t he  Ge r ma ns  use d to 
come and look for soldie
rs who at that point  
started defecting already.  They we
ren't looking exactly for Jews but  they were looki ng for soldiers 
but  in t he pr ocess ther e was al ways
 a fe ar the y  would fi nd us.  Th
er e was a chai n in the convent . 
Every time  that door be
ll  would ri ng the  comma n d we nt  dow
n t he chain and we
 wer e ta ke n and 
quic kly r ushed down i nt o a  ce llar. 
 At  one poi nt  we were
 sitting in a cellar w
ith a nun, hugged in a 
corner behi nd a big pile 
of potat oes; t hey stor ed 
vegetables in the cellar. 
 S o meh o w we wer e  al wa ys  
involved with vegetables.  But 
a nywa y, we  we re hidi ng be hind 
that pile of potatoes and the 
Ger mans did come down to t hat  cel
lar to look.  They po
ke d, I  don't  know whet
her it was with their  
guns or their bayo
nets or whatever but they 
did poke into the pile beca
use we heard potatoes rolling 
and everythi ng.  And they left.  I mean it was am
azing because all  t hey had 
to do wa s  walk ar ound 
the pile a couple of feet further 
and they would have s
een us .  Luc kily we didn't  ma ke a  sound, 
not hing, a nd we were s a fe.  And th
is happened several ti
mes.  But  anyway the 
e nd did c o me.  I ha d 
one close brush.  I still 
don't know whethe
r this person would have betr
ayed me or not
.  Every onc e  
in a while traveling 
pr eac hers  c a me  to the conve nt  and t his  on
e  ti me  one of t hos e t raveling prea che rs  
who came to preach grabbed me in the courtyard and 
he says you're a Jewish 
little girl, aren't you?  
And I said No.  I'll never forget 
it.  I r e me mbe r  hi m sh
aking me and yelling at 
me.  And he sa ys you 
know what happens to little 
girls who lie?  They go to
 hell and they burn in
 a fire and they suffer 
and he was screaming.  Finally 
I said, you're mean.  You're goi
ng to burn in hell and I literally  
fought  hi m physical ly.  He  fi nall y 
let me  loose.  I had 
t h e  ma rks  o f  his  fi nger s  o n  my  ar m.   T h e y  
were red ma rks.  I'll
 never forget that.  I litera
lly got loose and I ran to th
e Mother Superior's office  
sobbing and told he r wha t ha ppene d
.  She  i
m me dia t ely stor med out  an
d of course  I d
on't know.  She 
must have had a talk with
 hi m or  whate ver.  As  I sai d, to t h
is da y I 'll ne ver know.  I t  was very  
strange, why he grabbed 
me like that, I still don'
t know because th
ere were other 
children there.
 
 
Did you look particularly
 J e wish do you t hink?
 
 
Well compar ed t o a l ot of other kids
, my  hair wa s darker.  Don't go by
 the hair color, you know.  It 
wa s dark, re al dar k brown.  This
 i s  sort  of bet wee n gra y a nd a 
c ove r-up job.  M y
 hair wa s dar k  
brown.  It was a little more
 of an ethnic look
.  Many of the kids in that
 area were blue
-eyed, light-
haired.  My sister was a little more
 sallow skinned with al
mo st pitch black hair
.  She certainly did 
not  look Fl e mis h.  So I  do
n't know.  As  I said I  ha
ve  no e xpl a nation.  Mayb
e he se nse d  some thi ng, I  
don't  know.  But anyway ma ybe it wa s cu
riosity or  what  but I  never  found out.
 

 
That  wa s pre tty cr uel .
 
 
But it was one of my  clos
es  br us hes .   It  was  crue l.  And a fte
r the war I f
ound out that Father Br uno 
who supplied the fo od stam
ps for us had to get th
em illegally.  He had so
me arrangements with 
someone in the rationing of
fi ce.  But  the Mother Superi or also
 ma na ged t o get  some  sta mps i n a  
very interesting way which I didn'
t find out from her until 
after the liberation wh
en I went back to 
visit.  She told us that she knew
 little things about every 
one of the residents in
 the town.  Wh at she  
called she bl ackmail ed t h e mayor  i nto
 .....When they buried
 someone, what
 they did is they buried 
the m quietl y and woul d not re gist er t he death.  I n  
that wa y the  ma yor was able t o ta ke t hos e sta mps 
and gi ve t he m to th
e  convent  to fee d us.  But Fat her Br uno 
di d most of t h at.  
He suppl ied most  of  
the sta mps.  Fat her Br uno Re ynders .
 
 
Do  you wa nt to tell who he was?
 
 
Fat her Br uno Reynders wa s a Be nedictine Monk fr om
 a monastery in Lu vin[
ph100].  Father Br uno 
got  invol ve d int o hi ding childr en 
wit hout actually pl anning t o.  So
meone  a ske d hi m to hide  a  c hild  
and he coul dn't say no. 
 And t he n s o meone  as ked hi m to ta ke
 another child an
d another one and 
before he knew it he was actively 
i nvolve d in hi di ng c hildren.  He
 ended up hi ding thr e e hundr ed 
children, mo st of them boys becau
se boys wer e very hard to hide  
be cause  the y were c i rcumsi sed. 
Most  pe opl e  were a frai d to ta ke boys  but he 
ma na ged to find place s  for  boys  e speci ally in  
monasteries, even in
 his  own.  His  brothe r Jea n who is  a  de
ntist and is the only
 one of the three  
siblings still alive.  Th
ere was a nun, Sister Bern
adette who has di
ed since who help
ed with hiding 
the children.  Jean is still aliv
e i n Belgium and at  an
y give n t i me , I  under stand, Jea n wa s hi di ng 
about t w ent y- five peopl e in hi s 
c ell ar.  Father Bruno Re ynders  
was also helped by his nephew 
Michel  Reynders who pr esentl y i s t h e honorar y Co
ns ul for Bel gium in De nve
r, Col orado.  He was 
fourt een yea r s old at  t he  ti me , Mic h el Re ynders , 
and he would carr y messag
es.  Occasionally he 
wo uld accompany a boy to a 
hidi ng plac e  be ca use  he  was  able  t o
 get on a tram 
with him and he 
would fa ce  t he pe ople  a n d t he  boy w
oul d face  hi m and sor t  of ma ke  
their way to a hiding place. 
Fat her Br uno al most got  cau
ght by the ge stapo se veral 
times.  One time
 they came to 
hi s monast ery. 
A monk esc a pe d fr om t he bac k wh
i le the gest apo was i n t he front 
and was able to warn Father 
Bruno who kept  a small apartment to do his work
 in Brussels.  Father 
Bruno instead of going 
underground exchange
d his cassock for secular 
clothes and contin
ued doing his work until the end  
of the war.  He surviv
ed and he died i n  1981 at  the ag
e of 78.  There is
 a  monu ment  i n  
Utinyey[ph123] the town wh ere he 
di ed, Uti nye y[ph123], Be
lgium in honor fo r him.
  There is also a 
tree and pla que  for hi m at Ya d Va
she m i n t he  Al ley of the Ri ghte o
us.  Not only di
d Father Bruno 
hide  me but  Fat her Br uno--a fte r  
liberation I was wo
rking in a soap factory to
 help  my  mo ther  fee d 
my t wo si ste rs-- c a me t o visit and 
when he found out that  I wa s wor k
ing i n stead of going to sc hool , 
aske d me i f  I  wa nte d to go to school
.  I said of course but 
I can't, I have to help
 M a ma fe ed the ki ds . 
And he s poke t o my moth
er  and he  offer ed t o br
ing more  food j ust so I 
coul d go t o school .  He  

enroll ed me  in a Cat holi c  Sc hool. 
 Even though at  that ti me I al
ready knew catech
ism very well he 
gave strict instructions that I sh
ould be excused when cat
echism was taught.  In
 addition to that he 
paid for pri v ate pi ano le s sons a
nd t he y would l et me  pra ctice  in 
the convent whic
h wa s acr oss  the  
street fr om the sc hool.  They would leave the d
oor  unlat che d i n  the  mor n
ing be fore  school  a nd I  
wo uld go  in there and pr actice piano.  He  also  pa id 
for  t ypi ng le ssons.  And t o
 this day when I type, 
I sa y t ha nk you Fat her  Bruno beca use I ' m a ver y good
 typis t .  He als o paid
 for  Art c l asse s, extra-
curricular Art classes.  It was in
credible t hat  he wanted t o  cont
i nue  that.  Als o fr om what  I  
underst and, what I found out  a ft e
r the war and had 
c onfi r med se veral  ti me s, the chil dren who di d 
not  have  a parent  or par e nts  to c o me  bac k t o  a fte r  
the war, what he did - in
stead of leaving them in 
the monasteries to become 
good Chris tians , he  t ook t he m out  a n
d handed them over
 t o  the  Je wi sh 
agencies.  I n  other  word
s, these are your  childre
n, you take them.  That 
was Father  Br uno, a r eal  
Sai nt.
 
 
Tsa dik .
 
 
Yea h, Tsa di k.  So wa s t he Mot her  Superi or , M ar i
e Chrysost ome, the head of the monastery, and 
Sister Odonia, and Mssr. 
Ra nson, and the  pri nci pal  whose  na me 
I don't remember.  
I just found out 
the na me  also of the wo ma n who to
ok us  to t he  trai n.  I  ne ver  kn
ew her name  until
 the last few 
weeks.  In fact I have to call 
Michel Reynders 
in Denver.  Hope
fully he'll know wh
ether she's still  
alive or not.  If she's al
ive ,  I 'm going t o  go bac k
 to Belgium 
and thank her.
 
 
Are there any other  incidents or  episodes
 during t h e ti me  that you were .......?
 
 
Oh ther e were several.  Between Etterbeek and 
havi ng gone  t o  Ruis sele
de, another  pers on had  
jumpe d the  t r ain and ha d come  bac k
 to Br uss els.  His na me  was Appe
l .  Appel  had be
en sort of a 
boar der  in our a part me nt  just  be for e we  ha d t o wear 
t he stars .   He ha d l ost  a wi fe  a nd four  chil dre n  
in 1948.  Exactl y how he l ost  th
em I don't know but I 
know he did lose them
 to the Nazis.  I 
re me mb er  h i m a s  bei ng  a  very  d
our quiet sort of an
gry l ooking man.  He  al ways  s at near  t he  
window al most in total silence. 
 I  r e me mbe r  di sliki ng hi m beca us
e  he  wa s ver y unfri endly.  Of 
cour se  I  lear ned lat er on why. 
 You know, poor  
ma n, wa s so unfrie ndl y. 
 But anyway he was a 
boarder and it did help
 pay our rent a little bit.  
He was caught after we were
 in Brussels already .  
He knew where we had gone
 and so he knew wher e 
to fi nd us .  These t hings
 were sort of by word 
of mouth from one  Je w t o
 another.  Peopl e ende d up knowing 
where peopl e were, wher e you c oul d 
fi nd pe ople.  He also j u
mped fr om a trai n and he
 did c o me  and i n  touc h 
with us.  But there was 
absolutely not even space 
in t he apart ment because by
 that time my uncle a
nd my a unt l i ved and the  
whole apa r t me nt wa s just t wo r ooms.
  It  was a r eal tiny apar t ment.
  We  t r ied t o  fi nd hi m a not her  
place .  He wa s with us  me anwhile .  And t he n one
 mo rning he wa s gone an
d then he came back 
agai n a nd we were fee di ng hi m.  
He deci ded to fi nd shel ter i n  anot
her  buil ding.  That buildi ng was  
eventually bombed but he wa s outsi
de the building when it
 was bomb ed.  He th
en r eturned and he  

stayed in the bombed-out building
 figuring he was safe
 in a  bombed out  bu
ilding because nobody 
kne w hi m.  He was pr etty sic k by
 then.  So I was in charge of 
taking food to 
Mr. Appel.  I  
reme mb er I took food every day.  
He  was  wra ppe d i n  hi s bla n ket.  
At that point we
 a s ked hi m to 
come  ba ck t o the a part m ent but  he  di dn
't wa nt t o.   He sai d it 's  bett er 
i f he's ther e.  
He's safer in the  
bombed out  buil ding.  Al l 
I know is one day when I 
went  t o ta ke  hi m the  f
ood his  bl anket  was  ther e 
but he was not.  An d I've
 never seen him again.  So
 I don't know what happe
ne d t o  Mr . Appel .   And  
aft e r war ds we went t o Rui ssel e de .  We wer e  li bera
ted in Ruisselede.  We  we
nt back to Brussels. 
My sister s st aye d i n t he c onvent .
 
 
Co uld you tell us wh en that was?
 
 
That wa s in October of 1
944.  We  we re liberated. 
 By the time
 it was safe  it was around Nove mber. 
In N ov e mbe r  my  mo th er  and  I  ma de
 our way on fo ot to Br
ussels.  We  almo st di
dn't  ma ke  it  beca us e  
of the shooting and the 
bombi ng.  We got  ca ught  on
 the r oa ds  and e ver ythi ng.  But  a nywa y we did 
ma ke our  wa y back to Br ussel s.  We
 didn't go ba c k to the  ol d apart m
e nt .  We  found 
a  place .  I don't 
know.  I  t hink Mo
m mi ght  ha ve  gone  bac k  but  
fo und it totally emptied. 
 What  happened was which  
I didn't tell you.  My mother went 
back t o the apart ment every day 
t o bring food for  my aunt a n d 
uncle and one night when 
she came there was a gest apo seal 
on the  door .  Th
ey wer e gone .  
Nor mally about t w o or t hree days aft er an apart m
ent or a house was r aided
 and people were taken 
away, they would come  in with a 
truck and they wo uld empty the ap
art m ent or  the  house .  It  was  
called me ubl ation[ph198].  What  my 
mother  di d, she was i ncr edibl e, sh
e t ook the seal off, went  in, 
took out t he photographs and the  be
dding and le ft  and put 
the seal back.  No-o
ne el se would have  
had the guts to do it
 b u t  my  Ma ma .   That 's  w h e n
 the letter was wr
itten that I spoke 
about earlier.  So 
we made our way t o Bru
ssels after l i berati on and we found a sm
all pl ace t o live.  We furnished it  
wit h crates and whatever
 we  could find.  About  
four  or  fi ve  wee ks  lat e
r Ma ma  man a ged  to  fi nd  
some work and I was sent 
back to pick up my sisters from th
e convent.  Trans
portation was a little 
bit mo re back to normal 
by then.  We were able to come back by train.  So we came back to 
Brussels.  We enrolled the two kids b
ack i nto the same pub
lic school that  we  ha d bee n  in be fore we 
wer e put  i nt o hidi ng a nd I went  
to work.  And then Fat her  Br uno 
came to visit. 
 He was already  
bringing us s o me food a n d I woul
d vi sit hi m in hi s s mall  apart me nt 
when he was ther
e.  He stayed 
in Br us sels  s o he  c oul d give  all  t he  ki ds  ba ck, ge
t  them back fr om all  the 
different monasteries and 
give the m ba ck to Je wi sh age ncy.  
He was incredible that 
way.  So he asked me i f I wa nt ed to go t o  
school .  I  sai d of cours e I  wa nt t o go t o sc hool.  
He asked my mo ther then, he
 said he'd like to enrol  
me  in a  sc hool , he knows  of a g
ood school and she said we ll I can'
t, she has to help me feed the 
kids .  So he  sai d, I 'll  bri ng yo
u enough fo od.  He
 said, I'll bring you mo re
 food.  Let her go to 
school .  So my mothe r did.  An
d he enrolled me; it wa
s a Catholic School.  
And even though I knew 
catechism well alr eady, he gave specific i nstr uct i
ons  that I  woul d be e xc use
d fr om catechi s m.  I n  
additi on t o t hat he  pa id for priv
ate  piano le ssons .  I  di dn't ha ve a 
piano, of c ourse , s o I  went  t o  
practi ce be fore sc hool  in 
t he convent across t he street fr om t he 
s chool.  They left t he door unlat che d.
 
 

Ca n I  as k you, at t his  poi nt a ft er 
you wer e li berat e d, di d you ha ve 
any c ont a ct with 
your  fat her ...?
 
 
No, not  yet, not  yet ...
 
 
Ok ay, so you didn't know..
 
 
At t hat poi nt, no.  As a  matter 
of fact what we learned aft erw
ards , my  father  was very, very  
depressed.  He  had come 
out of the army and he wa
sn't  working for awhile. 
 He wa s just sort  of  
laying ar ound feeli ng li fe was not  
worth li ving because he was sur e
 he had no wi fe and no ki ds  
because ther e was no way he felt t h
at  a woman a n d t hree  ba bie s c oul d 
have sur vived.  Especi ally he 
kne w that my mother  ha d no mone
y, she  di dn't ha ve anythi ng.
 
 
Where  was  he stat ioned?
 
 
He  was  st ati one d i n  Fl or ida.  
He ha d hoped t o...that 's  how he bec a me  l egaliz ed a nd be ca me  a  
citizen.  He  had hoped that
 he  woul d be  se nt overse
a s, but t hey di dn't .  He  
was -  most  of hi s ar my  
career  was spent  somewhere in Fl ori da.
 
 
Whe n did he  find out  about you?
 
 
In 1945 through a British soldier 
who made inquiries th
rough the Red Cross an
d everything.  As a 
matter of fact I have a pho
tograph upstairs.  I'll br
ing it down  to show it 
to you.  So what ha ppe ne d 
we reali zed t hat cont act
 wa s ma de when one day the door bell
 rang, it was Christ mas morni ng as a 
matt er of fac t .  We were on t he s econd floor a nd 
I  ran down to ope n t he door.
  It was an American 
soldi er  sta nding there  wit h
 a box like this a
nd he s ays , Merr y Chr i st ma s. 
 I didn't  know what Merry 
Chr i st ma s meant .  Me rry Christ ma s -  and the n le a ves
.  J ust ha nds me this t h
ing.  Fir st he says, are  
you Fl ora  M endelo -  is  t h is t he  hom
e  of Fa nny Me ndel ovi cz?   I  sa id, 
ye s i t  i s.  He  sa ys , oka y Mer r y 
Chr i st ma s.  And t ook off. 
 An d th ere I wa s with
 this big box.  We  go upst
airs.  There was a let ter on  
the box, an envelope, taped to th
e t op of the  box.  I 'll never  for g
et Ma ma took off t h e e nvel ope, 
didn't eve n l ook in the  e nvel ope, we
 looked first in the bo
x .  It  wa s fill ed wit h
 food, c ans of Spa m, 
I'll ne ver forget, Spam.  We  ate 
it  though, ever yt hing, all  kinds  of
 food.  And the 
best  part was  a  
couple of bars of chocolat
e.  So we at e and we ate 
and we at e.  We  
we re  so si ck, all  of us.  We  l aid  
stretc hed out , we thre w u
p, it was really....we overat
e.  We wer en't used t o 
havi ng t hat much food. 
We  wer e so sic k, I 'll ne ver for get  it , e spe ciall y
 me because I wa
s a "chaza."   So t hat 's what  
happened.  Then she opened
 the letter and it said we
 have  bee n noti fi ed that
 you are the spouse and 
that t her e ar e thr ee chil dren wh
o are the fa mily of Da vid Mendel
ovicz, Private what ever  and we  

should present ourselves with
 t hat  lett er at  the ar my headquarters. 
 So we  di d.  The 
first thing we got 
invited to a big Christma s party. 
 Meanwhile we  had gone to a bi
g Chanukah party because we me t 
an Israeli soldier who wa s interest ed in me .  Of co
urse  I c oul dn't move  with
out my mother s o I went  
wit h her  when s o mebody want ed t o go wit h he r 
and she came wit h me wh
en some body wa nte d t o  
go wit h me.  But  anyway we we nt 
t o the Chri st ma s part y a nd e veryt hing.  And t hen t h e ne xt thi ng  
Mom went  t o hea dquart e rs a couple  of ti me s  and we
 were told that  the ar my was going to pr ovi de 
us with transportation to the Unite
d States but  for  some reason they
 c oul dn't do it out  of Ant wer p, 
that it wo uld be done in
 France.  But we  had to 
ma ke our way to Le  Ha vre.
  The one problem t h at 
we ran into is Mama
 had to get  a  pas sport ,  whi ch was  fine .  
I  was  pas t  fi fteen.  I ha d to ha ve  my  
own pas spor t .  I bec a me a slight 
proble m be cause  the other t w o were
 on her pa ssport s o they wer e 
my fat her 's c hildre n.  I ha d to be a n indivi dual so it  create d a fe w 
problems .  So they shelved[?275] 
us.  They said, don't worry 
about  it , t hey'll  ta ke  c are 
of it in Paris.  So we went to Paris.  In Paris 
they still didn't, they said
, okay why don't you go to 
Le Havre, maybe they can 
take care of it there. 
In Le Havre they still had a prob
lem with my individu
al documents and they
 suggested that my  
mother leave me in Le 
Havre and that so mebody 
wo uld take care of me, 
s o meb od y fro m th e a r my ,  
and when she got  to 
Ne w Yor k to fi nish up.  Bu
t she  sai d  she 's not  going 
without, at this point ,  
wit hout the t hree chil dre n, you k
now.  And so they said, I'll tell 
you what , they were nice, it was 
right a fter t h e war like, you know 
thi ngs were cr azy, thi s wa s 1946
 by that time, you know time  
we nt by.  So  he said, you know wh
a t, why don't you go on t he s hip.  
I f t he y give  you a  hard ti me  i n  
Ne w Yor k,  wo rse  co me s  to  wors e t h ey 'll  h old  h e r.  
The y let  us on the s hi
p.  We  got to New York, 
they just didn't say anything becaus
e  we  di dn't  go through Elli s  Isla
nd or anythi ng 
like t hat  because 
it was an army ship. 
 We came ri ght  into 
port and they just 
let us off the ship.
 
 
What  da y di d you c o me?
 
 
We  c a me M ay 29, 1946.
 
 
Is the re a nyt hing els e tha t you'd li ke t o add a bou
t your st ory t h at you didn't 
tell me now or we c oul d 
kee p it  for  our next  me eti ng. wh
en we talk abou
t your relatives.
 
 
If you want  t o kee p it  for  our  ne
xt me e ting, I 'll che c k up on t he 
dates, double- chec k on the  dat es.
 
 
Okay, so for  the ti me bei n g I  
want  to t hank 
you ver y much.
 
 
You're welcome.  (T
ape is turned off an
d then turned on ag
ain.)  One never real
izes the little details 
that creat e pr oblems, you know what 
t hey call  c ult ural shoc k.  The r
e we were on th
e ship.  And we 
had boarde d late at night and th
e next mor ning we ca me  into br
eakfast.  We  were there with 

soldiers, with war brides, all kind
s of pe opl e.  My mot her  was  the  
oldest war bride.
  Th ey thought 
she was a war bri de.  But anyway
, pe ople  thought  that  I wa s t h e wa
r bri de a nd t hat  my husband had  
bro ug ht my  mo ther  an d my  t w o  si
st ers and ever ybody was very sur p
rised.  When t hey
 fo und out it 
wa s my mother who was the soldier's wi fe they we
re even more surprised.
  But anyway here we  
come down to breakfast and we s
it down at these long 
tables that were lined
 up, don't forget it 
wasn't a luxury ship.  It
 was a luxury liner th
at had been converted to an 
army ship.  I 
still have a 
postcard somewhere of the 
ship, if you want to se
e it.  We ll, anyhow, ther
e I am sitting and I see 
something in my plate but 
it wasn't fo od. 
 It was a box; it wa
s a little box.  My mo
ther is looking at  
me  and I ' m l ooking at my
 mot her , my sist ers.  We were t urni
ng it  and t ur ning it,
 we didn't kno w 
what to do with it.  They were 
looking around and fi nall
y we  se e some sol di ers
 tearing the box open 
very ne atly, a line , othe r line, an
other  line , fol di ng it ba ck, a nd pour
ing mil k int o t he box.  And we  
thought that was the craziest thin
g.  How ca n you pour mi lk into 
pa per.  We ll, anyhow, we fi gur e 
well we'll do the same thin
g.  The n we noti ced, not onl y di d they
 pour milk in, t hey star ted eat in g 
right  out of t he box, not 
from t he plat e.  We thought that  was so
 stupid and s o ri dic ulous.  But we  
did t he sa me  thing a nd that 's ho
w we ma de our  ac quai nta nce wit h 
our dry col d cer eals.  I 'll neve r  
forget it, we sat there look
ing at  it.  And t he  ot her 
cultural thing is when I me
t my first Mello Roll in 
Ne w Yor k.   Yo u kn o w wh at a  M e ll o Roll  is?   It 's 
an ice  crea m that  c o me s wra ppe d i n  pa per .  But  
there  is no st ick or a nythi ng and 
what you have  to do i s
 you ha ve t o pus h it  
up from the  bott o m.  But  
I di dn't know.  I see  thi s
 thing and si nce the one th
ing I  had le arne d i n t he  ma ny c onve nts I wa s i n 
were good manners, I 
wasn't about to eat with 
my fi ngers.  So there I wa
s sitting in a 
high school 
cafeteri a where my husb
and ha d ta ken me , t hat 's  Jac k, and 
everybody looking at me  and he had 
order ed thi s ice cream for me, a Mell
o Roll, he  di dn't s ay it
 was ice cream.   And 
it's laying there and 
laying t here .   And si nce I  didn't  ha ve any ute nsil s
 and I wasn't about t o 
e mbarra ss...I  c o uldn't speak 
and that  was enough, I wasn't abou
t t o e mbarra ss mysel f  w
ith eating with my fing
ers.  As much as I 
wa s dyi ng to ha ve  it, 
I l e ft it on my pl ate.
 
 
That 's  funny, ok
ay, anythi ng else?
 
 
No, I don't really th
ink so, except one littl
e incident.  I went 
to high school and 
I reme mber the kids 
wer e la ughing i n cl ass  e v er
y ti me I  opene d my mo uth.  
 
   
 
In Ne w Yor k Cit y?
 
 
In New York City.  I enrolled myself in Central Ne
edle Trades High Sc hool
.   I  re me mb er  th e  ki d s  
laughing i n class whenever I  trie
d t o  open my mout h. 
 An d one day I couldn't
 take it anymore.  I 
bust  out cr yi ng a nd I ra n out , s obbing, a nd I s w ore I 
was never going to walk
 into t h at classroom 
agai n.  And the  tea cher  
ran out into the ha
llway after me , took me  arou
nd, consoled me, and took 
me back in.  From that talk it came out that I wa
s determined to learn Eng
lish.  Not only that, I'll 
never forget, I came back into cla
ss a nd I  sta rted screa mi ng at  ever yb
ody, I want  to see  i f you tal k 

French like I talk English, I'll la
ugh too.  I 'll never forge t  t hat I  
screamed.  We ll, 
the  cl a ssroom wa s 
quiet , nobody e ver  laughed at me  a ga i n.
 
 
That 's  ri ght , you're  ri ght .
 
 
There were a few thi ngs over th
e years, like one of 
them when my son cam
e home  c r ying fr om 
school , t he first grade, because 
I  had a very str o ng accent  yet at
 t hat  ti me.  And he came home 
crying and he said, Mommy please 
when you come  to school, don'
t talk beca use  ever ybody say s  
you tal k funny.  Well  at  
t hat poi nt I really started t o practi ce 
wi th a  ra dio a n d lis teni ng c are full y and 
worki ng in fr ont  of a mirr or t o 
correct my accent.  Eventually I did become cert ified to teach 
En glish.  I don't know wh
ether it 's  s o met hing I ha d t o prove or
 what .  But  I ma de
 my wa y.  I  di d 
leave high scho ol after a while.  I 
had t o l eave because I  had t o go to
 wor k .  I ha d t o he lp feed the  
fa mi ly.  I  never  fi nishe d high sc ho
ol.  Neve r fi nished el e mentar y 
sc hool.  Ne ver  fi nishe d Junior 
High Sc hool .  I t ook a n  exa m.  I  got a  di plo m
a, GED by exami nati on 
and I was allowed into 
college, actually on the dare of my
 son who wa s ent ering hi s first  ye
ar of c olle ge t h en.  I ha d to 
show t he kids that Ma ma wa sn't go
ing to back off and he said why 
don't you go ge t an e duc ation.  I  
knew I  was goi ng to fall  fl
at  on my face.  As it  
t urned out  I didn't  t otally
 alt hough I was sitting a t  
Mont gome ry Col l ege, I 'll  never for get .  I ha d gone
 to Americ a n U., spoke t o
 someone t here.  They 
gave me a stack of book
s to read and said come back in tw
o mo nths, I'll see if
 you're coll eg e 
mat erial .  So I went  ba ck
 two mont hs  later .  M ost  of t he bo
oks I had alrea dy r ead be ca use I  wa s  
teachi ng my sel f Engli sh at t he li brar y and apparently
 I  had chosen good mate
rial, Classi cs.  So t he 
person felt t hat yes I was coll ege ma
terial and t h ey'd be gl ad to en
rol me , except being that my  kid 
already start ed college for me t o
 go to a private colle ge...So I fo
und out that Mont
gomery Colleg e  
existed.  So I went to 
Mont gomer y  Col l ege and they
 let me in as a Special st udent.  I had to get a 
"C"  or  be tter .  I got  A+  
on my fir st  pa per.  I  des cri bed t he  b
eac h that 's  ri ght  out  my window her e in  
the fall.  It 's gorgeous 
in the fall.  But anyway
 I got an A+ . I didn't k
now an adject i ve from an 
adverb and when t hey start disc
us si ng gra m mar  I  wa s total l y lost
 bec a use  I  had basicall y just  
photographe d i n  my
 mi nd structure and paragrap
hs.  So I  wrote well  but  I  
didn't know wh y.  I read 
and I under s tood but  I had ne ver r e
ally learned the gramma
r.  So there we we
re in cl ass and t he 
teacher asked some thi ngs and I di
dn't  know and I  raised my hand to
 ask questions.  
There I  was thi s  
old mature woman with ni
neteen year olds and I'll never forg
et this little fr og 
came out of my  
mout h.  I  just (cr oa king 
sound) .  I could bar ely s p

.  I kept  quiet  a ft er a  
while.  I said to myself, what 
am I doing here, am I crazy, who 
ne eds t his.  And I vowe d that  I  
wa sn't goi ng to 
come  ba ck agai n but  bei ng who I  a m, I di d 
go back, went to th
e teacher and sai d ,  
look t his  i s my stor y, I  don't  
know grammar.  She sa
i d, no, I ca n't belie ve  
that, not the way you 
write.  I said, I'm telling
 you, I don't understand w

at  you're  talking a bout.  She  ga ve  me  her  lunc h 
hour, ver y ni ce.  I  spent s everal  wee ks  wit h her 
during her l unc h hour .  Sh

gra m mar , ga ve me  a c ouple of good gra m mar  books
 to study, which I studie

rest i s hi stor y.  From the r e I we nt

  Did not intend to become
 a teacher but one of my  

teacher 's sai d, well  what  are you 
going t o  do with your ed

working with my husband at the time.  I said I just

I told her the story.  She 
said, "  ha ve you e ver considere d..
...?  There are two things you'd 
be  good at , public relations  and

I j ust  want  an education."   She 
said, "you never know

Wh y don't you get a  degr ee in te achi ng? "  
So I  sai d, " well , what do I have

 and civilization.  I said
, " what do I have to do

He  says, "do me  a favo

want to come teach 
and go to graduate 
school.  They're also
 willing to waive th

"what are the GREs?"  So t hey waiv

i n vited to be a n a ssist ant .  I sai d " w hat 
shall  I  do, Jack?" because he rea

I ha d to do it .  I said, wh
