June 28, 1999 
Beginning Tape One, Side A 
Question: This u 
--
 This is a United States Hol ocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby 
Herr collecti on, this is an interview with Ed Lessing, conducted by Joe Richmond, on 
June 26
th
, 1999. Make t hat June 28
th
, 1999. This is a follow up i ntervi ew to the 
videotaped interview conducted with Ed Lessi ng, back in 1990. And the Un
ited States 

Holocaust Memori al Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making 

this intervi ew possible. This is tape one, side A. Mr. Lessing, we™re j ust going t o go on 

and recap some of your experiences during the war, and if you want to just 
start talking 
about -- I di -- basicall y from the beginning of the German occ -- occupation in the 
Netherlands, when you went into hiding, and t he [indecipherable] a short description of 

that ti me, and then we™ll go into the post-
war experiences.
 
Answer: The -- Well, as you probably know, Holland was invaded i n Ma y 1940, when I 

lived with my father and m y mother and m y t wo brothers, who are ei ght and 10 years 

younger than I -- than 
--
 than I am, in a litt le town called Delft, in Hol land. And m y father 
was all his life a musici an, and had recently opened a little clothing store, to see if he 
could get away from the -- th -- wi -- awa y from t he music. On the 10
th
 of May, t wo da ys 
after m y 14
th
 birthda y, the Germans suddenly -- I looked out the -- out the window, and 
there was all  German planes and paratroopers in the sky. And five days later, we were, of 
course -- the Dutch government ran awa y, t he queen ran awa y to London, and we were an 

occupied country. And it didn™t worry us too much, because the -- the war was going to

be over anyway very soon, we all knew that, and the Germans woul d never do i n Holland 
what the y had done in Germany, to the German Jews. But, pretty soon, of course, we 

began to find anti-Semi tic ordinances in the -- in -- in the 
--
 in the paper, and things 
progressed rapidly. Two years later, 1942, after I couldn™t go to school any more, and we 

were all wearing yellow stars on our clot hing, two years l ater, in October 23
rd
, 1942, we 
went into hiding. We were actually all set to go on the trai ns to what t he Germans 
euphemistically call ed work relief, in Germany. We were all set, we had our backpacks 
ready, but m y grandfather, who happened t o come over fo-for a visit from Amsterdam, 

warned us that -- warned m y parents that we -- 
we might notat
 all  be going to work in 

Germany, that the Germans were lyi ng, t hat there were rumors going around, and 

although no one knew where -- where we were yes going, he said don™t ever go. It seems 

to have made a deep i mpression upon m y parents, because at some point, the y decided 

we™re not going to go on those trai ns, like most of the Jew -- Dutch Jews, and we were 
going to go into hiding, although we had no pl aces prepared. So, as I said, on the 23
rd
 of 
October, 1942, we wal ked -- in the morni ng we walked out of our home, and never to 
return to that same house again. And that night m y family spread around. My na -- The y -

- 
My 
-- My parents went one way, and m y brothers went another way, I didn™t know 

where the y went. And I was left, for awhile, in that -- with our friends where we had 

walked to, i n the suburbs of Delft. I stayed there for a little while. And from there I went 

to -- first address in Utrecht, two old ladies who took me in, but very soon got scared, and 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051

I had to go. My  mother, who is -- really becam
e the 
-- the hero of this -- of our hiding 
story -- of our warti me story in general, was the only one who traveled on trains, and she 
went around finding places for all of us. She fou -- She decided that 
--
 She suggested that 
I would bleach m y hair and pretend to be a Christian boy, and work as a stable boy, s -- 

go find work on a sta -- as a stable boy on a Dutch farm. She then found a little farm 

somewhere, little farmer who had five cows, dairy farm, and that™s where I went to work. 
That was my first far m, and it was absolut e hell. I was this Jewish city kid, and I was 
supposed to go out at five o™clock in the morni ng, in the pouring rain, and -- 
and milk 

cows, and so, and I did. I -- I learned all that. I walked wit h bleedi ng feet i-in -- in 

wooden shoes, and -- 
very 
-- well, I don™t know how long I was there. My guess is -- 
My 
guess is ma ybe -- 
oh, ma ybe 
-- ma ybe a half a year, I -- I™m not quit e sure. The 
chronology is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but anyway, I -- I decided to give 

m yself up to the Germans. I couldn™t stand the -- the fear of being maybe discovered, and 
the loneliness. I was all  by m yself. I was 16 years old, and I decided t hat I couldn™t sta y 
in there, I would gi ve m yself up. I figured, sooner or later, the Germans are going to find 

me anyway, and -- but m y mother again, it ™s always m y mother i n thi s story, who came to 

visit me someti mes, secretly, we would meet somewhere in the fields, talked me out of it, 

and said she would try and find another place for me. And she found, through a whole 

long story that I can™t go into now, but she found a police officer called Oskam, was his 

last name, O-s-k-a-m, who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer, came from 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051

a completely Nazi fami l y, and -- but -- but -- i n -- in reality was a member of the 
underground, and was hiding about 30 Jewish men, women and children, in the little 
village not too far from Utrecht. And m y mother had asked hi m if he would know a place 

for me, and I talked with hi m, and he said, ﬁI have a place for you, but  it™s very 

dangerous. You wi ll not be able to leave there, and you will not be abl e to see any 

members of your famil y. Do you still want to go there?ﬂ And I sai d, well -- I figured 
everything was bett er 
--
 anything was better than being isolated by m yself on a farm. And 
he -- when I said yes, I would like to go t here, he took me to a -- a hut in the middle of 
the woods, where he left me with seven Dutch Resistance men, mostl y -- they were 

mostly of the -- what shall I say? The m -- More intellect ual 
class o
-of Dutch people. 

The y didn™t  look li ke what you would thi nk of partisans, or anythi ng, didn™t wear 

machine guns, or an-anyt hing like that, but they had built this hut. And I sta yed there 

from -- m y guess i s August 1943, until -- the exact date is 29
th
 of December, 1943. I was 
the only Jew, I was the youngest, I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then, and let™s 

see, the men would go out at night and raid police stations, and -- 
and ci
-city hall s, and -- 
and break in and get  identity claus -- get identity cards, and -- and official German 

stamps, and -- and weapons. And so we were sort of a center, people would stop in, a-and 

take awa y weapons, and -- and -- and papers, and so on and so forth. I should go just -- 

because it will relate to later on in this story, I should mention that one da y two men were 

brought in, one who claimed to be a Canadian, and one who clai med to be an 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

Englishman, and clai med to have been on a raid in -- in the -- in t he Royal Air Force, on a 
ra -- in on a raid to Germany, 
and were 
-- their bomber was shot down, and the y bailed 
out, and the y wound up in the -- and the Resist ance got them before the Germans got 

them, and they brought them into our hut. So here were these two men, and I was 

assigned to interview them, because I spoke English well . I don™t quit e know why, but I 

think I have a hint of why. My parents had lived in the United St ates for three years, in 
1929 to 1932. So I interviewed these men, and found out that the y were not German 
spies, but t he y were a bona fide RAF people. They w -- 
Th e y 
-- They spent awhile with 

us in the hut, but event ually they were smuggled out by t he Resi stance, through Belgium, 

through France, and Spain, and I guess Portugal, and -- and smuggled back to England. I 

don™t know if they ever flew again, I will find that out in -- in August. There™s a -- 

There™s a st ory connect ed with that. On the tr 
--
 In December, towards the end of the -- 
1943, we got a message, somehow another, an intercepted message t hat the Germans had 
become suspicious of the -- of the area, the woods where we were. We were -- 
We were 
in the -- in the middle of a small parcel of woods. In Holl and, you don™t really have 
forests. These were planted parcels of woods, rectangles, one after another, about four or 

five, and they had the very dense undergrowth of evergreens. You couldn™t walk through 

them, you would have t o smash your way through -- through the undergrowth, however, 

we had a secret path to the hut. As I said, in December, the men in the hut got t he 

message that the Germans had become suspici ous, and we were -- they then decided we 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051

should set out guards, and so a companion and I drew the l ot for the 29
th
 of December, I 
think four to eight A.M. watch, standing ri ght i nside the periphery of the -- in the woods. 
Now, on the -- on t he 
--
 on the woods, in -- wi thin the first line of trees, and that™s where 
we saw the Germans coming, in the half dark, and it was, of course, t raumatic, because I 

realized the y had come to kill me. I was very t empted to run awa y, I didn™t. The both of 

us ran back into the hut, warned the men. There was a total  confusion there, cause they 
were sleeping in the bunkbeds, and we pul led the blankets off them, and shouted, ﬁIt™s a 
raid, get up.ﬂ And when -- when we saw t hat t hey were all out of the bunkbeds, we ran, 

and we ran t o the edge of our parcel of wood 
--
 of woods, and as I always sa y when I -- 
when -- when -- when I looked to the left and t o the right, it seemed to me the Germans 

were coming around the corners of the woods, and I feared that nobody that we had left 

behind, would survive. We then jumped across the dirt road, into the next parcel of 

woods, and crashed through, and we ran and ran and ran and ran, until we wound up in a 
city called Hilversum, which you probably haveheardabout,
 it™s the center of Dutch 
radio -- radi o transmitt er. And I can™t go into t he details now, but  somehow another, we 

wound up at night  in the woods again, about five miles awa y from where the hut was, 

because that was the spot where we were supposed to reassemble in case of a raid. It had 

been previously agreed upon. And m y buddy and I, m y -- m y part ner and I waited there 

in the dark. We had guns, we had nine millimeter Mauser, and we had them at the ready, 

because we didn™t know if the men woul d have been tortured to reveal the place that the

Germans would -- might come and -- and ser -- I had pretty well deci ded then that -- that 
if they would come, that I would defend myself, I would -- I would try t o kill, and be 
killed, probably, in a short gunfight. So, I was all prepared to die. It was very quiet, and 

then after awhile I did hear some noise coming through t he woods, sounded like old 

met al rattling awa y, and thumping over -- wh- wheels on t he dirt, and this bic ycle rattled 

in the little clearing, and with a lit tle flashlight somebody was shining ahead of it. And 
we didn™t know who it was, we were ready t o -- to -- to shoot. But nothing followed, and 
then we approached with drawn guns, and found out that  it was not the Germans, and it 

was neither one of the men, it was m y mother, who had heard about t he raid, and had 

decided i mmediately to rescue us. Well, I t hink most of that escape, and so on, and my 

mother™s part in that is probably in the -- in the video interview. We escaped. My buddy -

- My mother gave the old bicycle t o m y -- m y friend, m y 
--
 m y partner, and she gave hi m 
also the litt le flashlight, and he peddled awa y i nto the darkness, he said he knew a place 
where to hi de. And m y mother and I pretended to be lovers, and as we approached the 
German guard, we talked very loud, and we gi ggled, and we -- you know, with -- with 

terror in our hearts, but we put our arms around each other, and we m ade kissing sounds, 

and the -- and the German guard whom we approached seemed t o want to stop us for a 

second, but  he didn™t, and we walked by him, and as I alwa ys sa y, to live another da y in 

[indecipherable] of that circle of death. After t hat I was close to a nervous breakdown, I 

needed help. Two -- Two older people, two Dutch people who li ved i n a very nice

mansion, put me up in a room, very peaceful room overlooking a gorgeous garden, and 
there I s -- recuperated slowly, I stopped shaki ng, and I became very religious, I found a 

Bible, and for the first time read something about the Jewish history, and became devoted 

to it, and for the rest of the war, tried to be a religious Jew. When I felt strong enough 

again, I left that place, and I got myself a new pair of wooden shoes, and I went out and 

found a new farm, now in a better part of Holland. And i n the more eastern part, where 
the farms are bigger, and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work t his ti me as 
a real farmhand. By then I seemed t o have had enough experience t o work with horses, 

and plow, and -- and of course I had bleached my hair agai n, and matter of fact, I had the 

chutzpah to go and register m yself with my fal se identity card in -- in the town hall, to 

alla y suspicion. It worked pretty well, I -- 
I wasn™t 
-- I worked on a couple of farms. The 
farmers were happy wi th me. Of course, every second was alwa ys a challenge if anyone 

approached the farm. It  was like, t his is maybe it. In Ma y, 1944, m y mother, coming back 
on the train from visiting my brot her Fred, my youngest  brother who was sick, was -- she 
had managed to put  in a hospital i n the south of Holland. On the way back, she ran into a 

expert on the train, German -- a Gestapo expert on the trai n, zeesha hi tes a deest expert, 

probably, and he i mmediately recognized that she had a falsified identity card, and he 

arrested her. And she -- And he put her int o a 
--
 into a separate compartment in the train, 
where she was guarded by a Dutch policeman on the wa y to Amsterdam, and that she 

later tells him -- I™m not quite sure any more at  this point, by the wa y, let me interrupt 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

m yself here for a second. I™m not quite sure how much of this is in the videotape. I™m not 
quite sure. I™m quoting here things that my mother and m y father said in interviews 

conducted --  audio interviews conducted by my brother Fred. My brother Fred conducted 

audio interviews with t he whole family, my father, m y mother, myself, m y brother Ott, 

m y cousins, m y wife. I have a tra y with audio interviews, with the voi ces of m y parents 

and everyone, and he later also transcribed it i n book form, toget her with his son. Now, 
all that, I think happened after the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. So, I don™t 
know, you can ask me l ater on it -- if it™s not cl ear, I can go back to it. As my mother sai d 

-- now I go back to what m y mot her as -- she was arrested, as m y mother later on told in 

interview with m y brot her Fred, she ate all the paperwork that was in her -- in her 

handbag, so the -- so that there was -- sh -- and she swallowed it. So by the ti me t hat she 

got to the i nterrogation in Amsterdam, when they ask her what her real name was, she 

lied, and she said t hat her name was Angeli ne Elizabeth Van Leer, which was her maiden 
name. She never menti oned her -- her married name. And since she didn™t have any other 
papers, except her false identity card, they wrote it down, and as she said, a-
as a 
-- out of 
the blue sky she added, ﬁAnd you have no right to keep me here, because I™m an 

American cit izen.ﬂ I don™t know if that™s i n the -- in the vi deo interview, either. In any 

case, she was sent t o -- to Westerbork, Dutch camp, and from there she was sent t o 

Bergen-Belsen, which we didn™t know, of course. When I somehow heard that m y mother 

had been arrested, I found m y father and m y t wo little brothers in a li ttle cottage t ogether, 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
in the -- not  too far from Arnhem, in Hol land, where -- that little cott age m y mother had 
rented just before she was arrested, in order to be a -- 
a 
-- just a week together with her 

husband and her two little sons. And of course, for her this didn™t work out, but my father 

had gone there, and m y two little brothers were there, and I found them there, and I 

decided that rather than work on t he farm, my father would need help to survive in hiding 

with my t wo little brothers. So I quit the farm, and bic ycled over t o t his little cottage, and 
that™s where we spent t he last winter of the war. Together with my two brothers and my 
father, we begged, borrowed and stole whatever we could to survive, and thus we reached 

the spring of 1945, when we were liberated by the Canadian arm y, and where -- I really 

should say this part of your intervi ew ends, because it was the end of the war. Many 

surprising things happened after that. If you want me to j ust go on with this now, or do 

you want to take a break? 

Q: Well I -- I am curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered 
in many different places, and your mom woul d -- would travel [indecipherable] and I™m 
sure it™s -- what [indeci pherable] look like. How much do you know what the ot her 

members of your famil y were doing, where they were, did you [indecipherable] see them 

from time to time. 

A: It™s very interesting question, and -- and as I go out speaking a lot to schools and so 

on, that question al ways comes up, people ask, ﬁHow did you know where your father 

was?ﬂ An-And I usuall y don™t have an answer for this. I can tell you t his, I did not know 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
in the very beginni ng where m y father and m other were, until the rai d on the hut, when I 
spent one night after the raid, after m y mot her and I escaped out of that -- out of the 

woods there, I spent one night at t heir hi -- their hiding place, which was in Soest, in 

Holland. So then I knew where the y were. My brothers, I never knew. But there was a 

littleti me, whichI don™tremember tooclearly,when my brother Ott, m y middlebrother, 

s -- came to the farm where I worked, and t his was m y lit tle brother who came from the 
city, and who needed to be fattened up a lit tle bit, and -- of course, he was also i n hiding, 
but -- and he spent some time with me on t his farm, I don™t know how long. From -- 

From his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or ma ybe 

even a month. I thought it was only a week. So, that period, I knew where m y brother Ott 

was, he was with me. But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944, 

until the liberation 1945, my father, m y two brothers and I were all t ogether. Some of the 

communication was achieved through my grandfather™s second wife. My grandfather 
lived in Amsterdam, my grandmot her had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish 
woman, and had a daughter by her. And I think that daughter, who was not Jewi sh, at 

least she was half Jewi sh, did not  wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to 

send some messages around, and I think i t must have been through her that I found where 

m y father and my t wo little brothers were hidi ng in that l ittle summer cottage. That™s as 

best as I can tell you. Course we had no phones, we didn™t write l etters, was -- we 

couldn™t. And -- So somet imes it -- I just -- it™s all conject ure, you know? 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
13
 
 
 
 
Q: How much were you aware of what was going on in the country, or with the war, or 
--
 
or in terms of what and where, wit h interest to Jews? How would -- How would you get 
your information? 

A: The minute that we went underground, of course, we were isolated from the rest of the 

population of the world, you could sa y. But here and there, you would pick up an illegal 

piece of newspaper. You know, there were 
--
 t here were illegal newspapers that consisted 
usually out  of two or four  pages, badly pri nted, and somet i mes you would find -- find 

one of those, or somebody would ha-hand you one of those. During my ti me in the 

Resistance hut, of course I found out more, because the men listened to the BB C, and we 

had a map there, and we charted the progress of the Russians and whatever else was 

happening. And we knew about the -- the bombardment s in Germany and so on. So, at 

that ti me, I was pretty well aware of where the -- where the Germans stood, and where 

the Russians were, and where the English were, and the Americans, and so on, and so 
forth. But after the raid, when I went back t o t he farm, I was totally isolated. The farmers 
had -- the y would t alk about the war, but t he y -- the y didn™t know what was going on. 

What we could see were, of course, a thousand B17 bombers fl yi ng over almost every 

day, and by night we heard the English, a t housand planes going overnight. We knew 

there was enormous bombardment s. And I had several interesting 
--
 i nteresting 
happenings at one t ime. A liberator bomber came down ri ght around the corner from the 

farm where I worked, and that was the ti me my brother Ott was t here, it seems, because 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
14
 
 
 
 
he, in detail , describes how that pl ane came down, and how we ran t here, and -- and how 
we found a little piece of -- of Plexiglas, little piece of -- from one of the -- one of the 

windows of the bomber, or the -- we -- we savored it like a piece of -- this was a piece of 

freedom. That was one. On another farm -- t his must have been al ready in the summer of 

™44, a Messerschmitt 109 was shot down, and crashed right into t he ground, right near by 

the farm where I worked, there™s -- there was another farm. And I don™t where I had the 
chutzpah, that I -- I was devoted to fl ying and -- and planes before the war, already. I 
loved planes, and build model planes. Anyt hing that woul d -- flew was to me, was 

fascinating. And here was a Messerschmi tt 109 lying pretty much undamaged except for 

it™s gear and so on. I-It™s propeller bent, and -- and there was a German on guard there, 

just a soldi er guarding t he -- the plane there. And I approached on bike, and I asked hi m 

if I could take a look, and he said, yeah, that™s all right, and I actual ly walked around the 

God damn plane, and t ouched it, and [indecipherable] all fascinating. How did I get onto 
that? Oh, you asked me about what I kn
ew aboutthewar. During our ha 
-- last hi ding, 
with my t wo brothers and my father, in the litt le summer cottage, we found out nearby, 
about a five minute wal k through the fields, there was a bi g mansi on type house, and in 

that house lived a whole collection of people, young and old. Lat er on, we found that 

several of them were in hiding themselves. But, they listened every day t o the BBC radi o. 

So, some might sa y the fall of 1944, until the l iberation, we knew pret ty well what was 

going on because of the evening -- in the evening we would go there, and we wouldn™t 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
listen ourselves, but somebody would go up and listen i n the atti c, where the y had a radio 
hidden, and the y would tell us, ﬁThe Russians are right near Berlin,ﬂ you know, ﬁand the 

-- the invasi on is going well.ﬂ By this time, of course, the sixth of June, 1944, the allied 

invasion of France, we knew it was happening. And then, of course, we had gone to 

Arnhem, which was not too far awa y, the disastrous attempt from the English to -- with 

paratroopers to capture the bridges, and being wiped out, and we t hought we would be 
free then. So anyway, t hat much we knew. Arnhem, we didn™t know the disaster, 
although it  was only a half an hour away from us, we heard all --

e One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memori al Museum interview 

with Ed Lessing. This i s tape one, side B. We were just di scussing again, your ex-

experiences during t he war, and you were mentioning the -- the various places 
that you 
were in hidi ng, and one question I wanted to ask is, how many of the places where you 
hid, how many knew that you were Jewish? 

A: The very first pl ace, two old ladies, knew I was Jewish. The next one on the farm, the 

first farm, dairy farm, t hey did not  know. In the Resistance hut, of course they knew I 

was a Jew, and weren™t  too happy about it , by the way. After the Resistance hut, when I 

started going back t o farming, on several farms, I registered as a -- 
as a 
-- as an C hristian. 
And then we co
me to 
--
 there are lit tle pieces i n between that I don™t even want t o go --

where I was a week , or I was a week and a half, or two weeks. I was with m y aunt in The 
Hague for -- for two weeks or something, and of course she knew was -- I was Jewish, 

but -- and t hen we come to the fall of 1944, when I joined m y father and m y two brothers, 

and there™s no quest ion, of course, there. So, the only places where people didn™t know 

that I -- that I was Jewi sh, was on the farms where I worked.  

Q: And again, you mentioned how your mother sort of set everything -- everything up, 
did a lot of the arrangements. 
A: Especially in the beginning. Not for me lat er on, I found -- after t he raid on the hut, I 

found m y own farms. I was -- I would sa y I worked there, and w -- 
I™
m not quite sure 

why I left to go from one farm to another. I probably thought that it was safer to not sta y 

too long in one place. It™s very hard to explain the intensi ty of -- of the deceit you had to 

practice. Your -- Your whole mind was set on deceit. 
Wh at 
-- What hi nt could a farmer, 
let™s sa y, get from me t hat I was not who I sai d I was, you know. Wa -- 
My 
-- 
My mind 
was constantly at work, so that I probably deci ded that it was not a good idea to stay too 
long in one place, because eventual ly something escapes.  
Q: What sort of things do you remember, were you worri ed that would give you awa y? 

Something you would say, or the way you act ? 

A: I™m not quite sure at  this point. See, this was a 24 hour a da y, seven da ys a week 

comedy you pla yed. This is like being on stage, practically 24 hours a day, every da y, 

even when y -- when you went to sleep, you had to watch out that  somebody wouldn™t 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
17
 
 
 
 
hear you dreaming, or something, and say somet hing. I had a false name. I might, by 
mistake, whisper m y own name in m y sleep or something, or s -- 
tell about my mother.I 

didn™t have a mother, you know, and the mother and father had died years ago in 

bombardments, both of them. I mean, the stori es that you made up, to -- in order t -- tho -

- it was a whole -- i -- t his was a whole false li fetime of history. Where did you come 

from, did you have family?  Where did you live? How come you™re working on a farm? 
You™re from the city. How come you work so well? You know. Why -- 
We™ve had city 
boys here, they -- the y never worked that well, the y didn™t  know how to go plow a field 
with a horse. How come you know? You know, this kind of stuff, and what is he 

thinking? Is he talking with his neighbors about this guy we have from t he city, who 

works so well? 

Q: And was that a t ime where farmers ma y have been suspicious, that -- since that sort of 

thing was happeni ng, and --  
A: That I don™t know. I don™t know. You see, i n Holland, a Jew woul d stand out  like a -- 
how do I sa y that? A mouse on a billiard table. I could instantly recognize if I saw 

another Jew someplace in Holland. And I™ve seen some on the -- on t he railroad station, 

once, when I was waiti ng for my mother t o show up, and -- and I saw a man, and I 

immediately recognized this guy is -- is a hidden Jew, you know. So, I thoug
ht, why 

don™t the other recognize me, maybe, you know? The -- The skill and deception was like 

-- it was like a spy story, spy who could const ruct a whole false -- false background, you 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
18
 
 
 
 
know? It was like -- And you had to make sure that you didn™t slip up anywhere, not a 
street address, not where you were 10 years ago, not where your father and mother had 

died. You know, you know, this kind -- not show any dislike of big chunks of -- of bacon, 

or ham being put on your -- you know, not the nice bacon that we get, with slices like a 

half inch thick, you know, it™s wi th all the fat on it, and farmers gleefully ate. And I ate 

them, and I said in m y head, I said -- asked God for forgiveness that I had to do this. But 
all that was a -- it™s like being onstage, and it™s very, very t iresome, you know? So 
anyway, it™s hard to -- very hard to explain what -- what it took t o stay out of the clutches 

of the Germans. And I -- There was a second t ime when I almost -- almost got caught. 

The first ti me was, of course, the raid on t he hut, second one was later on when m y -- 
when we all  lived i n that little cottage, and I -- we went every da y to get some food in the 

village. There was a central kitchen then, food being scarce, and all  that. And all of a 

sudden I ran into a German on thi s dirt road leading to the village. I was on thi s crummy 
bicycle that we had, and -- and thi s German st opped me, and wanted to see my identity 
card. I was l ucky, he was -- I th -- I have no idea w-what he was. You see, this is another 

part, to immediately gauge, if you saw a German, what kind of a German is this? Is this 

just a -- 
a 
-- Wehrmacht soldier? He doesn™t know shit from shi nola, you know, he 

doesn™t know about Jews, or identity cards. But, I once ran into an SS man, and that™s a 

separate story. But -- But this guy questi oned me, and I couldn™t figure out -- he was not 

SS, he didn™t have the SS on his -- on his coll ar, and yet, he seemed to intensely question 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
19
 
 
 
 
me, you know? And I j ust said that I lived -- t hat I was a farmer™s [indecipherabl
e] farmer 
here down the road. I was on -- on a -- and could see him swa yi ng back and forth. But 

what the hell he would have done, I have no idea, because t his was -- we™re talking now, 

probably lat e fall 1944, when -- when everyt hing was already in disarray for the 

Germans. Any case, that was a moment when everything sort of tightened up, and you 

stood there, and you said, is it going to go right, or is it going to go wrong? Is this the last 
-- is this it? You know? And it wasn™t, but it was al most. Oka y, I don™t know if I 
answered your question, but -- 

Q: Well, another questi on I had, from the video interviews, is that -- 
I 
-- I™m interested in 

-- in your father, it seems like, to a certain ext ent, he tried to maintai n a normal l ife, 

during -- throughout the hiding is -- you mentioned that he had painting lessons once a 

week, for example. 

A: Yes, he did. 
Q: He -- He sounds like -- like an i nteresting character.  
A: My father was an interesting man, he -- he was a kind of an ineffective man, i -- that -- 

and m y mother alwa ys held him up as the artist in the family, and she was the one who 

took care of everything. Even -- I mean, after t he war, before the war, she was the driving 

factor, sort of, in -- in 
--
 you know, getting everyt hing done. But  here they were, these 
two people, in a room, for two and a half years. You ever sat in a room for two and a half 

years without going out? It™s not easy. And he began to do sketches, put little still lifes on 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
20
 
 
 
 
the table, or -- and t hen he started painting wit h watercolors a little bi t, and pastel s, and 
m y mother got hi m art materials, and it was a God given thing, you know, cause he 

would have gone crazy there. And then, through somehow another, t hey found t his 

painter -- I have a paint ing of him [indecipherable] upstairs. I have several painting of m y 

father, and also of his teacher. Found this teacher where he went once a week. I didn™t 

want to go into the details about it , but I told you about the raid on the hut, and that m y 
mother came to rescue us in the woods. The reason why she knew was, when my buddy 
and I ran off from the raid, we wound up i n the city of Hilversum, I remember that my 

father took painting lessons from a man named Shlutter, a painter, well-known painter i n 

-- in -- in Holland. And that this man lived in a village near Hilversum, where we were, 

and I decided that -- we didn™t know where the hell to go, that I would to this Shlutter, 

because obviously he was all right, he was somebody we could trust, because he gave my 

father painting lessons. It so happened when we -- we took a littl e train there, a l ittle -- 
a 
little sht -- a little --  little -- 
a 
-- 
a s
--  a tram, and it so happened when we got there, m y 
father was there, painti ng, you know, very qui et in the st udio of this man. And my father 
said, ﬁWhat are you doing here?ﬂ And m y father never was very perceptive in things, and 

I told hi m, ﬁPop, we were raided,ﬂ you know? ﬁAnd I thi nk all the men probably are -- 

are going to be dead.ﬂ And he said, ﬁGee, gee, hm.ﬂ But he didn™t interrupt his lesson or 

anyt hing. And he said, ﬁSo where you goi ng t o be toda y?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, we don™t know, 

we™re,ﬂ -- and I don™t  know where we were all  da y, until we wound up in the woods that 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

21
 
 
 
 
night. But one thi ng is for sure, my father eventually went back to hi s hiding place, and 
told my mother, and my mother i mmediat ely grasped the seriousness of the situation. My 

father didn™t. And she 
--
 how she found out, I don™t know, I think probably to Mr. 
Oskam, the policeman, where the hell we would meet that  night. So m y father painted, 

and m y mother 
-- and my mother took care of the -- tried t o save the rest of her family, 
and did, and saved herself, too, of  which I will tell you. But his -- his glor-
glory period 
came when we were all hiding in that littl e cott age, from the fall of 1944, until the 
liberation, 1945. He became a real st rong father, you could al most say a brother to me. 

He and I took care of the boys, and oursel ves. But he and I decided what -- how to find 

food, where to steal trees, you know. Where t o beg for sandwiches from the farmers, or 

something, anythi ng. It was like a t eam. When m y father died, probabl y about 10 years 

ago, or so, I really felt like one of our team had died, you know? He shouldn™t have died, 

weshould haveall diedtogether, my two brothers, m y 
father, and I, we were a team, a 
wonderful team of -- that managed to survi ve. And my father died, of course he di ed, but 

it was like losing a member of a string quartet, you know, and say God, you know, 

irreplaceable. Anyway, so I have many funny stories about my father. My father mostly 

is known i n the family for his funny stories, because he did so many things out of -- I 

don™t know, re -- because he didn™t  -- he wasn™t aware. My wife always sa ys, ﬁYour 

father never was aware.ﬂ My father wasn™t aware of what the hell was going on. He 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
wasn™t even aware that I was in -- wa -- you know, wa -- m y life was threatened when I 
was there, you know, with m y buddy. So, I hope that answers that question, ma ybe. 
Q: I wonder from a certain sense t hat -- that led hi m -- that let him get through the 

experiences in a wa y different from other people. 

A: I didn™t understand that. What did you sa y? 

Q: That him being aware -- sh -- maybe shutti ng things out, allowed hi m to sort of 
mai ntain some of his former life all through that -- the war. 
A: That™s probably -- probably so, yeah. He™s an interesting man, I was never very close 

to hi m, except for that period then. I could tell you for hours about hi m, but I don™t think 

this is the place to do it. He -- He tried all his l ife to not be a musician, and yet, he only 

was a musi cian, he always went back to it. And after the war, when we moved to -- or 

when the y moved t o Springfield, Massachusett s, m y father really had -- I said, well, his 

only glory period was during the war, that  isn™t quite true. After the y moved to 
Springfield, Massachusetts, and my father began to pla y i n the Springfield Symphony, 
and he played in the Hartford Symphony, he was a cellist, and he set  up a string quartet 

with friends, and t he y gave concert s in -- in Pittsfield, in the Fine Art s Museum, those 

were glorious ti mes for him, because he loved music. So -- But during the war, and of 

course, I don™t know all of it, because the y were in hiding, m y father and mother together, 

and somehow anot her 
--
 I think my father probably had an easier time of it than m y 
mother, because he could lose hi mself for hours in sketchi ng a glass of water, and -- and 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
a little jar, you know? I have many of his sketchbooks still upstairs. So, where do we go 
from here? 

Q: Well, let ™s go -- let™s continue after the war. 

A: Oka y. 

Q: Let™s tal k about the war ended, and -- and what happened with you and the family 

from there? 
A: All right. I ma y duplicate some of it that was in the -- oh no, I ge 
--
 I don™t know 
where the original video -- video i nterview ended. 
Q: It ends pretty much at the end of the war. 

A: When we were liberated? 

Q: Yeah.  

A: Nothing after that? 

Q: Very little. 
A: Very little. All right, the first thing I have t o tell you about is -- its™ a little bit difficult, 
the structure is a little bit different. I must first tell you about what happened to m y 

mother, because it -- then I can go back to -- t o us. My mother, as I said, was sent to 
Bergen-Belsen. And interestingly enough, she had a -- she had a dream 
--
 m y mother was 
al
wa ys a lit tle psychic, by the wa y, very interesting. There were ti mes that she would sa y 
to my father, ﬁI think your father is maybe coming for a visit from Amsterdam t oda y.ﬂ 

And I don™t know, three out of five times, there was m y grandfather in the aftern
oon, you 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
know, ringing the doorbell. So we always thought she was, what  we call in Dutch, 
helderzingda, clear -- clear voyant 
--
 clairvoyant. She had a dream. I t hink -- I think it 
was in Westerbork, in t he Dutch camp. She had a dream in which she saw a newspaper, a 

masthead of a newspaper, and that said, January 21, very big, and she woke up from it. 

And she thought, ﬁI wonder what that means, i f it means somethi ng.ﬂ And she thought, 

ﬁEither I will be dead by then, or I will be free.ﬂ But then, how could she be free? I mean, 
she was in a concent ration camp i n Holland, and soon after that, she was sent to Bergen-
Belsen. And one da y in January, a friend of hers, who she slept with i n the same 

bunkbed, you know, the wooden bunkbeds they had there, said, ﬁYou know, Lene,ﬂ she 

was alwa ys called Lene, from -- from Angeline, ﬁLene,ﬂ she said, ﬁt here is an SS guy 

sitting in 
--
 in the barracks, and he™s checki ng on people who have foreign nationality.ﬂ 
And m y mother said, ﬁWel l, I don™t have forei gn national ity.ﬂ And her friend said, ﬁBut 

yeah, you said when you were interrogated i n Amsterdam, you t old him you don™t have 
any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen?ﬂ ﬁYes,ﬂ said m y mother, 
ﬁso what? You know, I don™t have any papers. I™m not real ly an American.ﬂ Okay, I got 

to go back, I got to b-backtrack, got  to backtrack for a second to the i nterrogation in Ma y 

1944, when she was caught in Amsterdam, in front of the Gestapo there. 

[indecipherable]. The y asked her what™s your name, and I told you she gave her maiden 

name, Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, and as an afterthought the y said -- she said, ﬁAnd 

you don™t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen.ﬂ And they 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
asked her, ﬁIf you™re an American citizen, where did you live in t he United States? Give 
us an address.ﬂ And she rattled off 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston. And 

it™s a wonderful thing, because it was one of the addresses where we had lived i n 1929, 

when my parents for three years, emigrated from Holland to the Unit ed States. It  was a 

lousy year t o come to the States, 1929, my fat her got sick, he got  tuberculosis, and so on, 

everything went wrong. In 1932 t he y returned again to Holland. But they did live at 121 
LaMartine Street,JamaicaPlains, Boston,and my mo
ther remembered it, and rat tled it 
off in front of the Gestapo, and the y wrote it down. The y must have l aughed, but the y 

wrote it down. So, now we go back to Bergen-Belsen, and it™s January 1945, and things 

are really getting bad in Bergen-Belsen. I 
--
 Sorry, I have to s-suddenly think of S-
Spiegelman™s, ﬁMaus Two,ﬂ which bears t he title -- when his father arrives in Bergen-

Belsen, either from Auschwitz, or wherever he came from, some horror, comes t o 

Bergen-Belsen, and says, ﬁAnd here™s where my troubles really began.ﬂ It™s -- It™s tragic, 
but it™s funny. Anyway, m y mother came to Bergen-Belsen, and here™s where our 
troubles really began. Sh -- Her friend said, ﬁGo to this S -- 
SS guy.ﬂ My mothersaid, 

ﬁWhy, ba, ba.ﬂ Sa ys, ﬁGo, go, go anyway. So what do you have t o lose?ﬂ So she went to 

this barracks, there was an SS guy sitting, and he was just closing the books, and sh -- he 

said, ﬁWhat do you want?ﬂ And she said, ﬁWell, I hear you™re checki ng on people with 

foreign papers?ﬂ And he said, ﬁYes,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut I just finished.ﬂ And she begged hi m 

to open the book again, and he opened the l ist again, and he said, ﬁWhat™s your name?ﬂ 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
And she said, ﬁAngeline Elizabeth Van Leer.ﬂ And he went down the list and he said, 
ﬁOh yeah,ﬂ he said, ﬁ you get yourself ready, and two da ys from n-now, you will be -- 
you 
will be exchanged for a German.ﬂ And she didn™t believe a word for it -- of it, you know? 

But two da ys later, there was a train standing. There was not a railroad spur into Bergen-

Belsen camp, as you may ha -- 
ma
y know, but there was --  people had to walk for two 
mil es outside of the camp to -- 
to Bergen
-Belsen, or Belsen-Bergen station, whatever it 
was. And t here was a train standing there with a big red cross on it, and she went in there 
with 301 other Bergen-Belsen inmates, and as she came in -- she tells this all later on, I™m 
re -- I™m retel ling now what she told to m y brother Fred in interviews later on. She said 

there was an SS sitting there at a litt le table, and she said, ﬁCould I have a little water? 

I™m very thi rsty.ﬂ She had been walking. And he said, ﬁSit down, you™re going t o get 

coffee soon.ﬂ And of course, she didn™t believe a word of that, eit her, but a little later, a 

nurse came i n with a tray with real coffee, whi -- nobody had seen in years. And then she 
began to bel ieve that maybe it wasn™t a ruse, you know? What they used to do to 
Germans wa -- load 1,000 people i n the train, promising them to go t o -- you know, be 

freed, and the y, you know, two da ys later, they™d be all gassed in Auschwitz, or Sobibór. 

So that trai n really started out and went through -- was very secure, there™s a route -- 

route through Germany, and m y mother lat er on says very gleefully, they all saw the 

bombed out cities of Germany. We™re talking now January 1945, of course. We™re 

approaching the end of the war. And that train would up i n, I forget, Saint Dollan, I think 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
she mentioned. It™s in Switzerland. And t he y came in on one side of the -- of the 
platform, and -- 
an
-and another train came on the other si de, and they were exchanged for 

Germans. And I got to tell you the rest of this, because otherwise what I tell you later 

makes no sense. The first night, they spent, sh -- this is a footnot e to t he Swiss t reat ment  

of dying -- 300 s --  terribly sick and dying Bergen-
Belsen in
mates. They put them in an 
abandoned school building on straw, and for the few -- first meal, m y mother sai d, ﬁThey 
gave us white bread, and cans of sardines.ﬂ And she said 
--
 she couldn™t help herself, she 
said she opened the can of sardines and poured the oil in t he sardines over the white 
bread, and j ust ate and ate and ate. And she sai d, ﬁI never was as si ck in the camp as I 

was that ni ght.ﬂ And finally she found some relief in the morning by throwing up. It was 

a terrible night, she sai d. She™d never been so sick in all those -- i n all  her -- all her ti me 

in -- in the 
--
 in the camps, or in hiding. And it got to be morning, and the others were 
still asleep, I think, and a little boy came by, and she had been in camp, and hadn™t -- did 
not know what was happening in the worl d. And she asked the boy if it was possible to 
get a newspaper somewhere, and he said he could, and he ran off, and he came back with 

a newspaper, a Swi ss newspaper, and she opened it. It said January 21
st
, and she was free. 
Now magica
l things, you know? That™s amazi ng. My mother was a pretty amazing 

person. Anyway, t he train went on, or another train, and they wound up in Marseilles, and 

there she was given a choice. She could go eit her to her si ster in Massachusetts, or she 

could go to Palesti ne. And she decided she -- and the third choice was she could go to 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
28
 
 
 
 
United Nati ons rehabilitation camp somepl ace. And she decided she™d go to her sister in 
Massachusetts, and for there there was a -- a ship lying t here, the Gri pshol m, 

Scandinavian ship. And that was transport ing wounded American soldiers. And she was 

already on board of the ship, and t hen suddenly she changed her mind, and she ran off, 

and one of the officers there said, ﬁYou can™t do this, you already,ﬂ 
--
 but sh -- he could 
never impress my mother, and she ran off the -- off the ship, and said she changed her 
mind, she wanted to go to rehabilit ation camp, United Nat ions camp. And so they put her 
on another boat, and I think the y traveled for a whole week over the Mediterranean, I 

don™t know why it  took so damn l ong, but she finally wound up in a United Nations 

rehabilitation camp call ed Jeandark, which was located in Philipville, in Algiers, North 

Africa. That™s where she sta yed until the end of the war. Now, okay, we™ll leave her 

there, sitting there, safe. Go back t o Forthausen, where we were in hi ding in the little 

cottage, and we are a couple of weeks liberated, and I could tell you many stories, I don™t 
know how long you want to do this interview. I could tell you a funny -- I think I really 
should tell  you thi s story, cause it is so funny. The Canadians came, and we spent three 

days in a dugout shelter, until -- under a fierce artillery bombardment , and then we came 

out, and we were free, and the Canadians settl ed all around us in camps, and there were 

tanks there, and God knows, and it was -- it was wonderful. But we didn™t have anything 

much more to eat, so my father went -- and we had been making something that was 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
29
 
 
 
 
called coffee, but it was made out of ground up shells of -- of -- what  do you call that 
fruit that comes from a oak tree? 

Q: An acorn? 

A: Acorns, ground up acorn shells. It was horrible stuff. My father went and persuaded 

the Canadian cook i n one of the camps that this was the best stuff, and he exchanged it 

for three cans of corned beef, or something, which we hadn™t seen in years. And so -- 
And we went into t he woods, and we found i n -- we found in -- a German mortar, and 
with the ammuniti on, and we went  and sol d that to the Canadians for -- for sugar and tea, 

and -- anywa y, but 
--
 oh no, not for sugar, for tea, an-
an
-and -- and bread, and -- but we 
didn™t have any sugar. So m y father peddled on this old little bi ke int o town, and he saw 

there was a detachment  of military police, huge guys, as he explai ned to them, broad 

shoulders, and the y had these enormous gl oves, and the y had Harley- Davidson 

motorc ycles with MP on it. These were tough bastards, you know? And my father went 
up to -- to one of them, [indecipherable] already, went up to one of them, and said, ﬁSir, 
would you have some sugar for us? We -- 
We™ve been 
-- hadn™t had any sugar.ﬂ Guy was 
a redhead, with a red moustache, as my father ex -- described hi m. The guy said, ﬁWhat™s 

the matter with you, begging around here? Say, you a Jew?ﬂ My father -- this is after two 

and a half years of not being a Jew, he said, ﬁNo, no, no, no, I™m not a Jew. I,ﬂ -- 
you 
know -- he says, ﬁNo, I just need --  wanted some sugar.ﬂ He said, ﬁGet the hell out of 

here.ﬂ And m y father went -- left hi m. The next da y he happened to be in town again, and

they were breaking up. The whole first division Canadian army was pulling through the 
village. Endless, you know, miles and mi les of -- of kitchens, and tanks, and carri ers, and

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a intervi ew with Ed Lessing, t ape two, side A, and we were just continuing on 
your story. 

A: All right, this l ittle story when my father came back int o the vil lage, and saw t he 

mil itary police unit  breaking up, and he went up again, to the redhead guy, who was just 

about getting on hi s huge Harley-Davidson motorc ycle, and revving up the engi ne, and 
m y father said -- and the guy said, ﬁAre you here again?ﬂ ﬁYeah,ﬂ said my father. ﬁI 
wondered if you left behind any sugar.ﬂ The guy said, ﬁI asked you yesterda y, are you a 

Jew?ﬂ And m y father said, ﬁNo, no, I told you I™m not a Jew.ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁ you see, 

I™m Jewish. I woul d have given you sugar if you were a Jew, but I don™t give to any 

goyi m.ﬂ And he roared off on his motorcycle. Ah, this is a lovely
, lovely story. You 
-- 
You got to realize t hat my family is a story tel ling family, both m y brothers, and m y 

father, and I, we all tell  stories, and we remember them. So, our whol e family is suffused 
with stories, and t his is -- this is a 
--
 a cutie from -- from t he war. Anyway -- from right 
after the war. Oka y, get  -- let™s get serious agai n. A couple of weeks after our liberation, 
m y father tells me, he said, ﬁYou know, the y t old me in Barnfeld,ﬂ -- a little town nearby, 

ﬁthere are some men -- 
some men wh
o have lists, and they take care of -- of -- 
of 
-- of -- 
of our Jewish people.ﬂ That was all  he knew, you know. So he said, ﬁI™m going to go 

there, find out about mutter,ﬂ the Dutch word for mother, we alwa ys called her mutter. I 

said, ﬁYeah, sure.ﬂ And he rattled off on this old bike, and th -- and 
--
 and by that ti me, I 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

32
 
 
 
 
al
-always keep on talking about rat tling bikes. You see, we didn™t  have any air tires any 
more. Tires were made then either out of wooden strips, very cleverl y, wound around 
with steel wire around t he ri m, or if you were a little bit better, old car tires were st ripped, 

the rubber --  solid rubber was then wound around, and so -- but you can i magine, within 

about a month, everyt hing rattled loose on your bike, so t he y alwa ys rattled. Anywa y, 
m y 
father set off, and he went to Barnfeld, and as he -- and now I™ll have to quote him, 
because he tells this lat er, also in t he interview, he -- he -- he reaches Barnfeld, and he 
goes there into a building, and behind a ricket y table, he find three older -- 
older men, 

yeah, three older, Jewish men, and the -- and t hey said, ﬁCan we help you?ﬂ And as -- he 

said, ﬁYes,ﬂ he said, and -- and I™m trying to express this as naïve as we were stil l. My 

fathersays, ﬁYes, m y 
--
 m y wife was -- was arrested, and she 
was in 
--
 in -- in 
Westerbork, in a camp, and then she was sent somewhere to Germany, I would like to 

find out where she is.ﬂ So the y sai d, ﬁWell, you™re in luck, because we don™t know 
anyt hing right now,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut s -- one of a -- one of our men is in Germany, and he i s 
coming back with all the lists, and where everybody is.ﬂ And we™re tal king about 110,000 

Dutch Jews, shipped out. And my father said, ﬁOh, thank you. I™l l be back in a week.ﬂ 

And a week later -- And he tells t his to me when he comes back to our little hut, we™re 

still living in that little cottage, not  a hut, a cot tage. And a week lat er, he goes again. And 

as he tells it later, he said, ﬁThere I saw the three men again,ﬂ he sai d, ﬁbut the y weren™t 

the same.ﬂ He said physically they were the same, but mentally t he y were completely 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

33
 
 
 
 
beaten down. The y said, ﬁMr. Lessing, we have just found out about  concentration 
camps, and there were gas chambers there. And there™s a very -- 
hardl y anybody isalive 

still.ﬂIn my speechesI alwayssay this 
is the moment that the y found out what we now 
call the Hol ocaust. We didn™t know. We didn™t know what happened t o those trai ns that 

left every Tuesday out of Westerbork to that work relief in Germany. My father found out 

then, right there and then. And they found it out, too. So, it was a terrible thing, and -- 
and -- and t he y said that we have li sts, but  there™s hardly anybody on them. He sai d, 
ﬁThey all murdered? Murdered?ﬂ He couldn™t believe it. ﬁWell,ﬂ m y father said, ﬁbut, 

could you just look, maybe my wife is on there?ﬂ And he said, ﬁWel l, we give you very 

little chance, Mr. Lessi ng,ﬂ he didn™t want to [indecipherable]. And he went down the 

list, Red Cross li st, and he said, ﬁBut she™s here, your wife is here. Angeline Elizabeth 

Lessing Van Leer.ﬂ ﬁGod,ﬂ m y father said. ﬁHow wonderful,ﬂ he said, ﬁwhere is she?ﬂ 

And this little old man said, ﬁShe™s in Philipville.ﬂ My father said, ﬁWhere™s Philipville?ﬂ 
The y said, ﬁPhilipville is -- i-i-it says here, Algiers, in North Africa.ﬂ And -- And another 
funny story. My father said, ﬁNo, t hat™s i mpossible, cause we never had anything to do 

with Africa. We never were in Africa.ﬂ He sai d, ﬁTha -- those -- that™s ca-can™t be,ﬂ you 

know? And as he said t hat, the littl e old man got kind of insulted, and he said, ﬁMr. 

Lessing, the Red Cross never makes a mistake. She must  be there. Now, you better go 

home and tell your children.ﬂ And so m y father went back, and he came back, and he tol d

us, ﬁYour mother i s alive.ﬂ It was exactly a ye ar, practically to the day that she was 
arrested. It was May, 1945. Well, that was one surprising thing. 

Q: When were you reunited with 
--
 
with your mother?
 
A: I™m not quite sure, but I think it must have been in August. We -- A couple of weeks 

later, we went on a -- on a Canadian arm y t ruck, and voyaged back to our homet own, 

Delft. And I must say, we were helped enormously by the members of the Resistance, t he 
people who have been i n the Resistance, who were still i n charge t hen, before the other 
creeps from -- who had never done anything, came back from London, and started to take 

over, and they [indecipherable]. But it was stil l in disarray, you know, and the Resistance 

people were in charge, and my father and his three sons came there, back to Delft, and 

they said, ﬁAh, Mr. Lessing.ﬂ They knew hi m, and the y said, ﬁWhat do you need?ﬂ And 

m y father said, ﬁOh, we need a place to live.ﬂ ﬁWell, we™ll give you a house, you know. 

We got houses from Nazis, Dutch Nazis. We™ve thrown t hem -- We™ve thrown t hem out, 
you know. The y™re in j ail now,ﬂ and so we got  a -- we got a house, three floors, I mean, 
they™re all been a -- you know, not detached houses, the y™re row houses, with three 

floors. And the y said, ﬁWhat else do you need?ﬂ And he said -- ﬁWel l,ﬂ  m y father said, 

ﬁI need some furniture.ﬂ And, ﬁOka y, we give you furniture.ﬂ And they gave us a -- 
a 

[indecipherable]. The y had a whole warehouse full of stuff confiscated from Dutch Nazis, 

and we got that, and we got spoons, and forks, and knives, and even some curtai n 

mat erials, you know. And -- And the y said, ﬁWhat else do you need?ﬂ My father said, 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
35
 
 
 
 
ﬁWell, I -- you know, I™m a music teacher, I -- I had a piano.ﬂ ﬁOh, we™ll give you a 
piano.ﬂ They gave him a piano. So, m y father and I fixed up this new abode as well as we 

could. We put the furni ture, w
hich wasall disj ointedpieces, you know,I mean, non
-

mat ching pieces, and where we thought it would do the best good, and -- and we hung up 

curtains on strings, and -- and that™s how we st arted out. And my brothers went back to 

school. God, I wished I could read t o you t he piece that m y brother wrote about going 
back to school. He was -- See, born in 1936, must have been about nine years old when 
he went back to school. He wrote recently i n a speech to the Michi gan State Assembly, 

he -- he wrote a little piece about going back t o school. He said t hat we were -- as if 

nothing had happened, open your book to page number 25, and he said, after two and a 

half years of being shit, you know, after being in hiding, after -- after denying our -- our -

- our -- our - - our -- our names, and our religion, and -- it was like -- I mean, the way he 

says it, a beautiful speech. Anywa y, the boys went back t o school, and right around the 
corner there was a -- t here were buildings of t he university, and t he y became a -- 
a 
-- a pr 
-- a prisoner of war camp for -- for Germans. And the engl -- There were English soldiers 
guarding them, and every da y we would see them march through town, you know, the y 

went to -- God knows what they did. Oh, the y -- they -- I don™t know what the y did, and -

- and then one da y, something magic hap -- magical happened. My brothers, who would 

go and hang around there, to see those German prisoners t here in t he camp, and the y™re 

looking through the gat es, and one day the y came, and there were no l onger Engli sh 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
36
 
 
 
 
soldiers there, they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve. And it said, 
Jewish Brigade. The y came home, and the y sai d, ﬁThey had Jewish soldiers there.ﬂ I 

don™t know, but my fat her and I di dn™t beli eve a word at first. What do you mean Jewish 

sol -- there are no Jewish soldiers. So we went  to look, son of a bitch, there was t hese 

guys, just like the Engl ish standing there,  you know, guarding the gate. So, the way that 

m y brother tolditlater on, m y 
-- m y little brot hers went t here, a
nd they 
--
 they said, 
ﬁHow do we make clear to them that we are Jewish boys?ﬂ So, m y brother Ott, who was 

always kind of inventive, said, ﬁYeah, I know something. Let™s go, and I™ll stand next to 

hi m, and I™l l sing us the only Jewish song I know.ﬂ And he started to hum, didn™t know 

any words. And he started [sings notes] which I think it -- I™m not qui te sure what  it is, 

but he said -- it™s a well  known song, I thi nk, that people sing at Passover, or you know. 

And the soldier looked at hi m, and said, ﬁCome here.ﬂ He said, ﬁAre you Jewish boys?ﬂ 

The y said, ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁCome in.ﬂ And the y brought them i nto the camp, and the y became the 
mascots of that battalion, and every day trucks would pul l up in front of the house, and 
soldiers™d sa y, ﬁAre the boys here? We want  to take them up to a trip.ﬂ And it was all 

wonderful. In August, I think, 1945, I came back from a Zi onist meeti ng in The Hague. 

We lived again in Delft, which is about 20 minutes by trai n one way. I came back from 

The Hague, from a Zionist meeting. My cousi n had said, ﬁYou better go to The Hague, 

there™s a group of kids there, they all were i n hiding, and the y sing songs, and the y dance, 

and then there are also nice girls there.ﬂ Wel l, I -- here I was, I was 18 or 19, never been 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

37
 
 
 
 
kissed, never been t o bed with a girl, you know? I mean, my teenage years were gone. 
Girls, God. I wa -- In no ti me, I was on the train, and it was wonderful. There was all 

these boys and girl s, and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, who brought 

food and drink, and they t ook us for weekends, and I joined this Zionist group. There™s 

also a girl there called Carla Hymons, but she was three years younger, and kind of a kid. 

I didn™t pa y too much attention to her. Course, now I been married to her for 50 years. 
Anyway,
 I came back one evening from a Zionist meeting, Sunda y -- 
Sunday morning, 
came back. It was -- It was dusk, and I approached our new home, and there was an 
English arm y truck standing in front of the house, which was not hing special, because the 

-- the Jewish Brigade alwa ys had t rucks st andi ng there in 
--
 but a-as I ran by, from under 
that -- that camouflage canvas, a woman™s voi ce called, and said, ﬁOh sir, could you tel l 

me where the Lessi ngs live?ﬂ It was my mother™s voice. I™ve alwa ys been warned, when 

doing interviews for the Shoah Foundation, watch out, departures and reu -- when people 
reunite, that ™s when people start to cry, and it™s true. It al ways -- It  al ways happens that 
way, because that was m y mother -- m y mother™s voice, and I barely had strengt h to -- t o 

say, ﬁMother, it™s me, it™s Eddie.ﬂ And she came out of that truck, not at all what we 

expected. She was all tanned. She came in an army jumpsuit. I mean, we ex-expected this 

Bergen-Belsen emaciat ed, sick person, but  of course, she had recup
erated marvelously 

out there in Algiers, and as a matter of fact, t ypically like my mother, in no time at all, I 

understand, a few weeks after she arrived there, she was i n charge of the office already. 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

38
 
 
 
 
Anywa y, t here she was, and we rang the doorbell, and m y father came, and -- and he was 
just, you know, he just -- he kept on saying to her, ﬁJust sit down, I just want to look at 

you.ﬂ And she walked around [indecipherable] and she had -- she had boxes full of stuff 

to eat. And we had saved one chocolate bar, t hat had fallen out of the sky one day when 

we were stil l hiding in that little cottage during the winter of 1944 - ™45. The English 

made a mistaken drop of an enormous amount of weapons and radios, and also food 
canisters. And I had managed to get one of the food canisters, and hi de it until the 
Germans had taken everyt hing. The Germans had been warned, and t hey came and took 

everything, but the y di dn™t get thi s. Out of that, we had saved, for all those months, one 

little chocolate bar for m y mother when she -- when she would come back, ma ybe. And 

here she was with boxes full of stuff, you know, with chocolates, and cigarettes, and 

whatever she could have got of there, out in that -- anyway, well t here she was. She had 

flown back -- two bombers had flown from Al giers to Paris, and as I l ater h-heard 
--
 this 
is -- I mean, this is the God damnedest ironic and horrible thing, one of the -- one of the 

bombers, w
-with survivors, had flown from Algiers back t o Europe, t o France. Most of 

them were Dutch. One of t
h em 
-- One of the planes crashed, and everybody was killed, 

but the other one arrived in Paris, and m y mot her from there hitchhiked, [indecipherable] 

and finally wound up i n front of our house, and there she was. And my brother Ott, in hi s 

hurry to see her, he fell down the stairs, I remember. He rolled down t wo floors of -- of 

stairs, and i t was pandemonium, but it was glorious, glorious, glorious. And my mother 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
39
 
 
 
 
walked around, and she said, ﬁOh, beautiful, this is -- is t his ours? And m y father said, 
ﬁYes, this is our h-home now.ﬂ And she said, ﬁOh look at  all the furniture you have, and -

- and,ﬂ -- thi s is the -- m y father telling, you know, again, a little story, a mini story, he 

says, and she walked around, and she said, ﬁOh, it™s so beautiful, and -- 
an
d look, you 

even put curtains, and I,ﬂ -- she was so impressed. She said -- But the next morni ng, 

when she got up, she said, ﬁWell, t he couch is not right there, we got t o move that, and 
those curtains, the y got to go. Th-That™s -- That™s a mess, and,ﬂ he said -- m y father start s 
shifting everything. Typically, like a woman. And then m y brother said, ﬁMom, there are 
Jewish soldiers around in, and the y guardi ng prisoners of war.ﬂ You know what my 

mother said? She said, ﬁI never want to see another Jew in m y life.ﬂ Oh, it was shocking. 

However, t hree weeks l ater, at a party in the Jewish Brigade, Italian camp, she was a 

performer, she was an amateur singer. She sang Yiddish and Jewish songs for them, and 

she just loved it, so. 
Q: What di d that mean to her, or to you at that point that she [inaudibl e] see another Jew 
in her life? 

A: If you read what she tells about  Bergen-Belsen, she said everybody stole from 

everyone else. She said you couldn™t leave a -- a hanky lyi ng around, you find the next 

day itwas gone.
 
If you 
-- well, at one point  -- 
I 
-- I can™t tell  you the whole story of m y 
mother, but th-there -- she tells about one night, she ca -- she wa -- she -- she managed to 

get a job in the kitchen, from I think midnight until seven in the morning, or something 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
40
 
 
 
 
like that, where she was once in a while be able to steal some -- a pot ato or something, 
which would -- she would then divide wit h her friend, or somethi ng else, a lit -- tiny bit 

of extra food. And she said, ﬁOne morning I came back from m y j ob, and the whole 

barracks was empty.ﬂ And she said the Germans had thi s craz y mania, like every two 

weeks or so, they woul d move everybody around into different barracks, for no God 

damn reason that anybody could see. But  then you had to move your stuff, and if you 
weren™t there when you, as she wasn™t -- she 
--
 she came, and it -- 
it wasinthe middle of 
the winter, i t was very cold, she sa ys, bitterly cold. Snow everywhere. And she said, ﬁI 
came, and there was no one there, and all m y stuff was gone.ﬂ And she said, ﬁI sat  at the 

doorstep of the barracks, the empty barracks,ﬂ she said, ﬁand I cried.ﬂ And she said, ﬁI 

don™t want to go on, this is the end, I -- I don™t want to go fight any m ore.ﬂ And t hat™s her 

-- with her magical t hing, she said, ﬁI heard a voice sa ying, you must go on, don™t give 

up, don™t give up, you must go on, you must li ve,ﬂ she sa ys, ﬁand then I -- I schlepped 
m yself to the barracks where the y had gone, and I pushed somebody aside so I could get 
a place in a bunkbed, and -- to sleep. And I borrowed a blanket from a friend,ﬂ or 

something. Anyway, she continued on. So -- B ut she said you couldn™t trust anyone. The y 

would sell your -- their -- your -- their souls for -- for -- you know, they™l l sell you for a -- 

for a piece of bread. So her i mpression of Jews was like, what do you expect, you know? 

Anywa y, let me continue with the story, otherwise we™ll sit here until  a long, long ti me 

yet, because there™s more to come on this. So, m y mother was back, and I went back to 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
41
 
 
 
 
school. Now I was -- I was a terribl e scholar, I -- I -- I had been to high school, and 
failed, had been held back. In -- In -- In desperation m y father had asked a neighbor, 

ﬁWh
- What should I do with my son?ﬂ And the neighbor had said, ﬁDo you know what™s 
a good profess -- send him to trade school, he learn profession.ﬂ And then m y father, 

ﬁWhat 
-- What kind of a trade school? What ki nd of a profession,ﬂ and -- and this man 

said, ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁI work with people who are instrument makers. The y --  The y --  
The y -- The y make and repair scient ific instruments.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt ™s a good job,ﬂ he said, 
ﬁand maybe your son can learn that.ﬂ So, I don™t know if you know the Yiddish 

expression, ashander? It means -- 
It means 
-- It  means a -- i t™s a terribl e thing in t he 

family. It used to be said if a -- if a girl marries a non-Jew, that™s ashander, it™s -- it™s 

Yiddish, and it means 
--
 it™s a -- it™s a -- it™s a terrible thing. So here m y -- I probably was 
the only Jewish boy who ever was i n that trade school. I mean, there were no Jewish kid s 

in trade schools. The y became lawyers and doctors and writers, and whatever, but here I 
was. I had gone to t he t rade school, and during the war, when the Germans decided 
Jewish kids couldn™t go any longer in school, I was out of trade school. And now the war 

was over, and I went back to the trade school, and I finished one year of -- to get a 

diploma in instrument making. It didn™t take very long after that, I worked at one jo -- I 

worked at two jobs, and -- with instrument companies in Delft, and first as an apprentice 

in the shop, and lat er on -- m y mother made another decision for me, come to think of it. 

My mother said, ﬁWhy don™t you take a little vacation before,ﬂ you know, and --  oh, the 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
42
 
 
 
 
first job I had, I worked in a machine shop, as an apprentice tool maker, or instrument 
maker, and I had a -- I found out I had an anti-Semitic boss, a g 
--
 a guy who sai d Jews 
are no good. And I told this at home, and m y mother said, ﬁYou quit, right now.ﬂ And I 

quit. She sa ys, ﬁNow you to-take a vacation,ﬂ oh no, first, ﬁgo around, see if you get 

another job.ﬂ And I went to another -- there was another i nstrument company, very 

prestigious one, and I asked for a job there, and they said, ﬁWell, we don™t have a j -- we 
don™t have a positi on in -- in the -- i n the sh -- in the -- the shop, but w-we could take you 
on as an apprentice draftsman.ﬂ And I said, ﬁNo, I -- I work in t he shop.ﬂ My mother 

said, ﬁWhy don™t you go take a vacation for a week? Go visit friends.ﬂ Which I di d. 

When I came back, she sa ys, ﬁYou have a job as a draftsman.ﬂ I sai d, ﬁBut I said no.ﬂ She 

said, ﬁI took it for -- I told them you would take it.ﬂ And that was it.  

Q: Let me ask you, you mentioned that your brother had gone back to school, and how 

strange it was to sort of all of a sudden be studyi ng, you know, open your book t o page 
one. What was it like, the attempt to return to normal life, and how much was it l ike 
normal life? What -- What were people -- Were people reuniting? Were people were -- 

talk about the experiences? What was that sort of, you know, getting back 

[indecipherable] 

A:From my memory 
--  It™s going to be hard to believe what I™m going to tell you. We 
didn™t talk about the war. We sort of went right into picking up where we left off. I™m still 

sayi ng it t oda y in m y speeches to -- to -- 
to adult 
-- when I speak t o adult audiences. I sa y, 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
43
 
 
 
 
ﬁWe thought we would just pick up where we left off, and we did. We thought t hat two 
and a half years of hidi ng was an interruption, but now we were back.ﬂ And life -- I 

joined this -- 
this grou
p, m y father started teaching music, my brothers went to school. 

Nobody talked about the war. Nobody talked about. There was no Hol ocaust. The word 

didn™t exist, the beginning. I was t ogether in this -- this group of -- of -- of we went with 

hundreds of kids who had been in hiding. We went on weekends, provided by the Jewish 
Brigade. Nobody talked about what had happened. It was as if we -- as if we were ger -- 
normal kids. When I think it back ows -- it seems incredible, it™s unbelievable that  w -- 

but -- but I guess we had to do it, in order to get started again. So m y answer to you is 

that life seemed to resume normally where -- where th -- where we had left off, two and a 

half years before. Course, we weren™t Poli sh Jews, who came back and then were 

murd
ered. Or, later on a Czech friend of mine here in the United States, says, ﬁWhen I 
went back to my vi llage, they tried to kill me, when I tried to get m y parents house back.ﬂ 
We were wel comed, and well, friends said, ﬁWe™re glad you™re back.ﬂ We got a nice 
letter from t he little -- t he maid, who had -- we had had that -- a maid before we left, and 

she wrote us a nice l etter, ﬁDear Mr. and Miss,ﬂ -- 
to m y parents, ﬁDearMr.and Mrs. 

Lessing.ﬂ She was a si mple soul. ﬁI™m so glad you™re back, because I already 
thought you 

had kicked t he bucket.ﬂ She sa y -- She wrote it , something very si milar in that. Life 

resumed. For all those who didn™t  -- 
who had disappeared,therewas no 
-- we didn™t talk 
about that.

Q: Even wi thin your family, you didn™t talk about it? 
A: Even wi thin our family, nobody talked about it. There was no discussion. The 

discussions came 50 years later. And pretty soon -- well, a -- as I said, I was in t his 

Zionist group, I met thi s girl, and she was three years younger, but  then a year later, m
y 
father and I, we got a -- we got a vi sa for the -- for the United States, which was very 
unusual, and m y parent s said, ﬁAre you coming to the United States?ﬂ And I sai d, ﬁNo, 
I™m a Zioni st, I™m going to go to Israel.ﬂ Palestine, then. And the y said, well -- 
the y 
talked me out of if, they said, ﬁWhy don™t you come with me? You have a visa now, 

come with us to the States. We need help to get started. Ma ybe you can save some mone y 

and help us get started.ﬂ We didn™t have any mone y. And so, I agreed. But I managed t o -

- like, a month before I agreed to leave, before we supposed to leave, I fell in love with 

this girl. And when I left, we made an agreement that if we woul d keep on writing letters, 

then it would be somet hing, but if we didn™t keep on writi ng letters, well then, it was 
nothing. And so, m y father and I left for the United States. My father went to Springfield, 
Massachusetts. And I got a job, m y first j ob, with -- we act ually went both to m y aunt and 

uncle, liv -- the aunt  that my mother was supposed to go to. Aunt and uncle lived in 

Holyoke, Massachusett s. And from there, m y father went t o Springfield, and started 

teaching music, and my uncle got me a job in General Elect ric, in Schenectady, New 

York, as a tool maker, and that™s where I went. And so, the first year, m y first year in the 

United States was spent in Schenectady. And I would call that the armpit of -- of New

York State, it was about the worst place. And I think that™s where, maybe the first 
inti mations of what had happened to me began to -- to be felt a little bit, because I had no 

one there. I was almost in the same situati on when I was -- as I was on m y first farm. I 

knew nobody. I lived in a -- the room I -- if somebody had said t o me, ﬁIf you -- You 

need a room?ﬂ And I said yes. Oh, the man at General Electric, at the employment office 

there said -- personnel office, he said, ﬁWhy don™t you go to the YMCA, the y have an 
announcement board and people post rooms for rent someti mes.ﬂ So I went there, and I 
found the McDuffys, or something like that, and -- on the street, and I rented a room from 

two older ladies. And they had some more rooms, there were other st udents, there were -- 

there were some Latin American st udents there. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is interview wi th Ed Lessing, this is tape two, side B. And you were just talking 
about coming to the United States. 
A: Yeah, I rented this room from these two -- two Cathol ic ladies, and after a month, the y 

said, ﬁEd, we™re sorry, we -- we need the room for someone else.ﬂ And I was out. And I 

thought it was a little st range. In the meanti me, I had contacted -- I found out there was a 

Jewish Communi ty Center, somet hing I never knew about, and I went there, and I spoke 

with the director there, and I said, ﬁYou know, I had this room, and,ﬂ -- he said, ﬁWho 

was it?ﬂ I said, ﬁMr. and Mrs. McDuffy, on the,ﬂ -- whatever, ﬁCedar Street,ﬂ or 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

something. He said, ﬁYou rented from Cat holi c people?ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, 
did they know you were Jewish?ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, I told them, you know, I said I was a 

Zionist, and,ﬂ -- he said, ﬁOf course y -- th-t hey didn™t want you in the house.ﬂ He said, 

ﬁWa 
-- You,ﬂ he said, ﬁWe have rooms here for rent with Jews,ﬂ he said. My first -- 
My 

first hit with anti-Semit ism in the United States. I haven™t found any after that, I must say, 
you know, but it was a revelation. I thought, ﬁOh, my God. That™s sti ll going on in this 
country?ﬂ And I thought, ﬁI™m not going to take this. I had this for two and a half years.ﬂ 
And it began to dawn on me that I was different from -- from the regular -- 
what should I 

say? American -- American Jews, t hat I had -- I had a past. And I met -- Well, I got 
another room with a very old Jewish lady, who spoke mostly Yiddish, and she was very 

sweet, but I  didn™t have any heat in my room, so I had to alwa ys leave the door opened. 

But she was very sweet, and was my first touch of Yiddish. I had never heard Yiddish 

before. And here was a lady who spoke mostly Yiddish. 
Q: Y-You mentioned that that was when you started to feel that you were different from 
other Jews who hadn™t had that experience. In what wa y do you mean, like h-how did you 

start to feel different? 

A: Well,it c 
-- it came about because I met -- t hrough the people I met at the Jewish 
Community Center. I met a guy called Phil, forget his last name. He was the all American 

Jewish teenager, I guess. A little bit older. Yeah, he was pre-college, he was -- yeah, he 

was teenager, he was i n -- probably in hi gh school. And he and I made friends, somehow 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
47
 
 
 
 
another. And Phil, well , I realized, was a happy guy. He had a car, he did some 
--
 he did 
some amateur -- no, not amateur, he did some photography for the local newspaper. You 
know, he would take -- go to a fire, or somethi ng like that. What t he y call it, a stri nger, 

probably, ri ght? Anyway, Phil -- Phil seemed to have -- 
wasterribly unlike me. H
-He 

wasn™t serious about life. He wasn™t worry about de -- worried about death. He -- He was 

-- Life was happy. He went to school dances, and to reunions of his class, and he invited 
me for New Year™s Eve, ﬁYou want to spend New Year™s Eve wit h me and m y family?ﬂ I 
says, ﬁYeah, great.ﬂ In Holland, on New Year™s Eve, the whole famil y comes together, 

and you make special pastries and so. So I came to his house that evening, about nine 

o™clock, and I just bumped into hi s father and mother, who are on their wa y out. The y 

said, ﬁHi, Ed, we™re,ﬂ 
--
 I said, ﬁWhere you going?ﬂ ﬁOh, we™re goi ng to a party.ﬂ Oh, oh, 
and so the y left. Then his sister came out with her boyfriend. ﬁWell , Ed, have a nice 

evening.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhere are you going?ﬂ ﬁOh, we™re going to celebrate somewhere, New 
Year™s Eve, with friends.ﬂ So it was Phil  and me. I realized this is different. These 
people, the y just have fun, the y go out, the y part y. New Year™s Eve was a serious 

business i n Holland, you remembered, you know, life and death, and -- so Phil said, 

ﬁWhat shall we do toni ght?ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t know, what do you do on New Year?ﬂ He 

says, ﬁYou want to crui se around with the car?ﬂ He had this big Chevy convertible. I 

don™t know, we -- we cruised around through Schenectady until it  was after 12, and then I 

went back to my lit tle old Yiddish lady, and 
--
 and I realized I™m different, this i s -- then I 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
met  someone else. A -- A man who seemed a little older t han me, and he was from 
Czechoslovakia, and he -- I realized it years later, he was a Holocaust survivor. But I 

didn™t know what a Holocaust survivor was. He said, ﬁI have a car. You want it,ﬂ -- 

somehow another, I guess he -- 
he saidwhere were you, 
and I said I was in Hol land, in 
hiding. And -- And he said, ﬁOh.ﬂ He said, ﬁI was in camps.ﬂ And he -- who knows what 

camps he ma y have been in. Auschwitz for all I know. The name didn™t -- if he had said 
Auschwitz,  it wouldn™t  have rung a bell wi th me even then. And we spent a little ti me 
together, and he tol d me -- he was t he man who said, ﬁWhen I tried to go back to my 

village, and get to m y father and mother™s home, who had been killed in camps,ﬂ he sai d, 

ﬁthe y tried t o kill me, and I ran off.ﬂ And he was a butcher in the A& P. I think it™s the 

first time t hat I met  up with a camp survivor. I™ve always remembered hi m. So I realize 

there was a l ittle bit of a kinship t here. Anyway --  

Q: And yet  -- And yet, you didn™t™ talk about your experiences there? It was just 
something that was [indecipherable] 
A: No, we did not talk at length about what had gone behind. Survivors didn™t tal k about  

what happened then. You were busy maki ng your life. Anyway, let me see if I -- 
let me 

not forget anything. I worked for about a year at General Electric. 

Q: What was your famil y doing at  this point? When did you all  

A: Well, m y motherand 
-- no, my mother wasn™t over yet, my mother and brothers were 
still in -- in Holland, and my father was in Spri ngfield, Massachusetts, beginning to set up 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
49
 
 
 
 
a teaching schedule, and I was in Schenectady. And my girlfriend was in Holland, and I 
wrote letters like craz y. Man, did I write. And after a year, I -- I quit at General Electric, 

as m y plan had been. I just had joined General  Electric in order to l earn the American 

system for measuri ng, and the tool names, and all that, t he -- you know, the -- how -- 
we 
-

- we di -- we had the metric system in Europe, and I wasn™t used t o the system the y had 

here, and so -- so I t ook that year, and I learned, and I worked, and it was very interesting, 
I had a very good time, and  worki ng with -- 
withAmerican men,and my boss wasa 
great guy, I -- was total ly unknown i-in Holland, somethi ng like 
--
 first day I was there, 
he said, ﬁEd, call me George.ﬂ I said, ﬁThat™s m y boss, I can™t cal l -- call -- call hi m -- 

can™t call him George.ﬂ But he insisted, it  -- it was like Jesus. When I left one of the -- an 

old man, Hank Kruger, old toolmaker, he said, ﬁI™ve been here for 35 years. What are you 

leaving for?ﬂ I said, ﬁWel l, I want to go back to drafting, you know, become a drafts -- I 

was -- I was a draftsman when I left home.ﬂ He said -- ﬁI on -- I only took this j -- this j ob 
to learn about tools, and so on.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou™ll never get a job like this again. You can 
stay here forever,ﬂ you know, and -- and I thought, ﬁGee, d-d-don™t  they fire peopl e 
here?ﬂ He said, ﬁYeah, you got to commit  a murder in order to fire someone,ﬂ he said. 

ﬁBeside, the union would -- union -- union wouldn™t let t he -- let you be fired.ﬂ I was a 

member of a union, electrical workers. But I did quit, after a year, and m y mother came 

over. I went  to New York, and m y mother, and my brothers came. We all went to Radio 

City Musi c Hall, saw Gene Kelly in ﬁThe Pirate.ﬂ Grace -- Great days, and -- and I found 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

50
 
 
 
 
a job in Ossening, little bit up the river from --  you know, Ossening, New York. Which 
--
 
Life is very strange, I 
--
 I had writt en down some names when I -- when I left Holland, of 
companies similar t o the ones -- the one where I worked as a draftsman in Holland, a 
scientific instrument company. One of them was the Cambridge Instrument Company, 

and I called t hem, and I explained that I had worked for Kip and Sons in Holland. And 

oh, they sai d, ﬁOh, w-we make the same t hings here. We™d love 
t o meet you, Mr. 
Lessing.ﬂ And I sai d, ﬁWhere do I go?ﬂ And t hey said, ﬁWell, our headquarters i s in 
Grand Central Stati on, in New York, in the office building.ﬂ And I traveled to Grand 

Central, and -- and oh, they were delighted wit h m y resume, and -- 
as
 it was at that ti me. 
And the y said, ﬁWell, we™d gladly -- 
gladly h
-have you,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut all we want you to 
do is -- 
is do meet our 
--
 our chief engineer, Mr. Digby, an Engli shman.ﬂ I said, ﬁOka y.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁSo, I™ll take t he t rain to Cambridge then.ﬂ The y said, ﬁNo, no, our -- our -- our 

factory is located in Ossening.ﬂ I said, ﬁAren™t  you in Cambridge?ﬂ  The y said, ﬁNo.ﬂ 
The y said, ﬁWhy woul d you want  to be in Cambridge?ﬂ I said, ﬁWel l, m y parent s live in 
Springfield, and I figured Cambridge near Boston, and -- and Springfield, it™s an easy -- 

there™s a train connection, and a -- you know, it™s an hour,ﬂ and -- ﬁOh, no,ﬂ they said. I 

said, ﬁWell, what™s Cambridge Instrument Company then?ﬂ They sai d, ﬁOh yeah, well 

years ago, we used to be a sister company of Cambridge Instrument Company in 

England, but what -- what had not hing to do with us any more, we™re now located in 

Ossening.ﬂ And that™s how I wound up in Ossening, and t hat™s why I™m living here in 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051

Westchester still. Anyway, I got t he job there, and started working, and then m y girl 
came over. And -- B ut before that, I should tel l you another little inci dent with m y 

mother. I lived on the houseboat, I -- When I got the job i n Ossening, I lived on a 

houseboat i n the ri ver, on a dock in the river. It was a houseboat somebody else had lent 

me. He said, ﬁWoul d you take care of the houseboat? You can have it for a year, with no 

rent.ﬂ Oka y. So I wrote all m y letters from the houseboat in Ossening, and one da y I got a 
letterfrom m y mot her, andsaid,ﬁI wan
t to send you here t his littl e advertisement  that 
I™ve cut out of the Jewish newspaper in Holland.ﬂ And I plucked i t out of there, and it 

said that Ed Lessing was engaged t o Carla Hymons. And so I was engaged. My mother 

had decided that we were engaged, so -- it always makes a wonderful hit because at our 

50
th
 wedding anniversary, I told this story about our engagement. People -- Americans, 
they -- they look at you -- ﬁYou were -- your mother told you were engaged?ﬂ I said 

yeah. I didn™t think it was strange. My mot her had seen that we wrote a lot of letters, and 
she figures here™s a nice girl, Ed, you™re engaged. So we were engaged to get married, 
and so we married. She came over, and we got  married in 
--
 what is it, 1948, I think, in 
Chicopee, Massachusett
s. 

Q: What sort of things did you write in your letters? I mean -- 

A: Oh, desire, love, forever. I mean, I had three little black and white photographs of her, 

and the y just drove me craz y. I could look -- look at them for hours. I -- I just crazy with 

love for this girl. Oh, it was endless letters about -- I told her about what I was doing, and 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
what -- you know, but each let -- I wrote at l east -- at least  four letters a week, and each 
one had a least eight , if not 12 pages. When the -- When it was all over, when the y come 

-- I had a -- we filled a suitcase wit h -- and she would wri te back once in awhile also, but 

not that much. She would also write I love you. I wrote -- 
anywa y 
--  
Q: Was it important that you both had si milar experiences during t he war, that she was in 

hiding as well, or did that -- was that not even part of the conversation? 
A: Of course, because t hat™s how we met. We met in -- We met in the Zionist 
organizations. Bot h of us didn™t want to l ive i n Holland, both of us wanted to go to 

Palestine. I mean, all the girls, all t he boys, nobody want to sta y in Holland, although 

some did, but we all wanted to get -- get the hell out, and go to t he -- many went to the 

United States, others went to -- to Palestine. C arla™s brother went -- helped by the Jewish 

Brigade to get to Palest ine illegally. It was the end. We didn™t realize why it was the end, 

I think even. It™s just st range, when I think back of it. We wanted t o get out. None of us 
knew the numbers, by t he wa y. None of us knew at that time that 75 percent of the Dutch 
Jewish population had been -- had been murdered. A lot of people went on those trains, 

and the y -- yeah, wel l,   you heard, I have an uncle, or somebody had -- that his father 

was killed, or -- but  it didn™t form a picture. Again, the Holocaust  did not exist yet. The 
--
 
The scope of this -- of this horror, was this -- was unknown to us. It had been bad, and a 
lot of people got ki lled, it seemed, but what can I tell you? That™s how I remember it, 

anywa y.

Q: So what changed? When did people start to see it as this [indecipherable]  
A: Well, I got to jump way ahead, but let me see. I better stay a litt le bit chronologically, 

otherwise it  doesn™t make any s -- we got married, and in 1950 we decided now was the 

time to go to -- to Israel. 1948, the state had been declared, in 1950 we left. We l eft on the 

LaGuardia, a ship of the American export li ne, and we had a marvel ous trip across. We 

stopped in various places, Gibraltar, and Paraeus, and -- and we wound up in Haifa, and 
Carla™s brother was there, and we went to where Carla™s brother and sister-in-law lived in 
a kibbutz called Dovrat , in Israel. And there we lived for five years, as kibbutni ks -- 

kibbutzniks. Idealists. You didn™t make, you know, no mone y, and I started working at 

first as a blacksmit h there, because I had som e experience with metal working, of course, 

a-and later on I became a tractor dri ver, I had m y own little tractor, and I spend most of 

m y ti me spra ying poisons on apples, and pears, and grapes, and -- and Carla worked in 

the children™s houses, with -- wit h the babies, and with little children, and -- 
and our 
daughter was born in 1952, I guess, and we named her Noa, N-o-a, for figure out of the -- 
out of the Bible. And I wasn™t very happy i n the kibbutz. I had already tasted indi vidual 

life, and it was very hard to adjust. I had been an independent guy. When I come to think 

of m y whole life, I™ve been -- always been m ore or less a -- a lo -- 
a 
-- 
a 
-- 
a 
-- a guy who 
did better as a -- as a s -- as a loner. Not -- Not necessarily complet ely detached from life, 
but -- but as one who took care of himself. I took care of m yself during the war, most of 

the ti me. I was not with anyone else, I was by myself, except for la -- at the end. Before 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

54
 
 
 
 
that, I had t wo brot hers, but the y were eight and 10 years younger. They were alwa ys 
together, li ke twins, and I was by myself out t here, you know, 10 years older. So, I had 
worked in t he States, I had worked in Holl and, in m y own profession, and here I was a 

tractor driver. So I wasn™t too happy there. My daughter got sick, she got tuberculosis, 

which runs in the family, and almost died in the hospital. And strangely enough, we had 

not made any decisi on to go back t o the United States, but it -- it  happened through a 
bunch of strange coi nci dences. I had no family in Israel, none what soever, all my family 
was in the United States, and it was quite a -- quite a group by then. My two brothers, m y 

father and mother, my cousins had come over, with wives, with their children. It grew 

here in the States, all around Spri ngfield, and so on. And I was -- I was sitting out in -- i-
in Israel, and everybody was poor, they didn™t  have mone y to travel t o Israel to -- in those 

days everyt hing was di fferent, you know, you didn™t say, ﬁOh wel l, we go, you know, 

spend a couple of weeks in Israel,ﬂ you know, wh-what the hell, a couple of thousand 
bucks, so what? 20 doll ars was a lot of mone y. So, I had actually no prospect of seeing 
m y family again. Carla had her brother, and an uncle, and she had some family i n 
Israel, I 

didn™t. And my mother wants us 
--
 
when we 
--  when we left the United States to go to 
Israel, Carla and I, we had asked for a re-ent ry permit, which you needed in those da ys. 

You needed a re-entry permit if you wanted to come back i nto the States, as a non-

citizens. We weren™t ci tizens, you know?Ihadsentthe mone yto Washington, butthe re
-

entry permit never cam e. Oh, we said, so what. It was just -- It was like a -- 
a 
-- 
a safet y 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

55
 
 
 
 
line in -- in case we wouldn™t like it in -- i n Israel, then we could al ways come back. But, 
you know, we liked it well enough, and five years went by, and then m y mother wrote. 

She said, ﬁDid you ever get that re-entry permit?ﬂ And I wrote back, ﬁNo, we di dn™t. We 

sent the money, but we didn™t get it.ﬂ She -- 
Well, m y
 mother being well, m y mother, 
immediately spoke wit h her senator. ﬁWhat the hell™s goi ng on here? My son sent mone y 

to Washington for re-entry permit .ﬂ ﬁI™ll look into it.ﬂ Two weeks later a letter came from 
the embassy in Tel Aviv, that, ﬁYou are hereby requested to reapply for a visa to the 
United States,ﬂ and I hadn™t planned to apply for a visa -- send photographs. And we 

thought, well, m y daughter hadn™t been s -- been so sick, and al most died, and ma ybe we 

should go back for some ti me, and 
--
 well, f rom t here it rolled on and on and on and on. 
The y needed photographs, you needed documents, you need to go to the local police to 

tell you that you were a good character. And one day a letter arrived i n the kibbutz, and 

somebody in 
-- the letters in the kibbutz al l come to the office, and then they get 
distributed. And somebody in the office said, ﬁHey, I™m going to open this letter.ﬂ He 

opened our letters from the embassy, and said, ﬁHey, these people are applying to go 

back to the United Stat es.ﬂ Now, i t™s hard to i magine at this point in the history of Israel, 

but then, if you left the kibbutz, just leave i t and go to the city, you were an outcast  

already, sort  of. The y would give you a table, and two chairs and a bed, and 20 bucks, 

and goodbye Charl ie, that was nice of you to be in the ki bbutz. We don™t want t o have 

further anyt hing to do with you. To go back t o the country where you came from, you 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
56
 
 
 
 
were yuradeem. There are two words in Israel, one it alle yah, which means going up, 
when you go to Israel, you make alle yah, you go to Israel, you go up. The word El Al 

comes from there, by the wa y, the airline. When you leave Israel, you yurate, you go 

down. We were yuradeem, people who go down. It was, again the word ashander, an-and 

it was a terri ble thing. And in the general meeting, in the kibbutz, the members decided 

that we had no right to live there any more, even though we had worked for five years, 
our butts off, and all that, but -- and we had been bona fide members, they voted us out. 
But the y didn™t want to throw us out right away, first -- they woul d throw us out as soon 

as I found a job, some 
--
 outside of the kibbutz. So I went , and I appli ed for a job, and I 
got a job as a draftsman, in an English company, the refineries, the oil refineries in Haifa. 

And I don™t know any more what happened, but we didn™t -- we deci ded that we wouldn™t 

stay in Israel after all. However, we couldn™t go to the United States either, because of 

m y daughter™s tuberculosis that she had had. They took x-ra ys, and they said, ﬁYou™ll 
have to wait  a year.ﬂ In those da ys tuberculosis was like AIDS t oda y. You had it , you 
didn™t get i nto the States, and that was the worst. So, the y said, ﬁYou™ll have to wait a 

year.ﬂ And I don™t know, we decided, you know what, if we have to wait a year, l et™s go 

to Holland, and we™ll wait a  year t here, and then we™ll apply to the American embassy 

there. And so we got on a ship, and left Israel with our daughter, and went back t o 

Holland, and we li ved t here for one year in 1956. I went back to t h
e same place where I 

had worked before as a draftsman, found out about a new profession t hat I had never 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
57
 
 
 
 
heard about, and immediately deci ded that was the profession that I wanted to learn. It 
was called industrial design. I™d never heard of it. It was i deal for me. It was a 

combination of art, and technology. Industrial designers are the people who desi gn cars 

on the outside, and telephones and refrigerators, and -- in other words, people who give 

shape to modern indust rial products. Anyway, we spent a year in Holland, had a 

wonderful ti me. One of the best years of our li ves, I don™t know why, but it was just 
wonderful. My daughter, in quick succession, dropped her Hebrew, which she spoke 
fluentl y, and learned Dutch, and at the end of the year, when we went to the Unit ed 

States, she dropped her Dutch, and in three weeks spoke fluent English. So, went through 

three languages in no ti me at all. And so we got back to t he United States. 

Q: But let™s just go back to Israel for a moment. Again, being identified as people who 

had survived the war, an-and what was t -- as you say, to later become the Holocaust, was 

there -- were people i-i dentified in different ways, [indecipherable] didn™t feel like the y 
were different [indecipherable]. Were there conversations about t hat? 
A: It™s g -- It™s a good question you ask, because it brings me back to our five years in 

kibbutz. It™s astounding. In the ki bbutz, t here was a group of youngst ers who had come 

from Romania, the y were all orphans, their parents had all been killed. They worked a 

half a day in the morni ng, and in the afternoon the y learned, they had school lessons. I 

actually set up a litt le drafting course for some of them, for some of the boys that wanted 

to learn drafting. Do you know that it never occurred to me that they were Holocaust

survivors? That the y had gone through hel l? That these kids were 
--
 I mean, that t he y 
couldn™t even i magi ne what these children had gone through. The y were just ki ds to us, 
yeah, and they were not such good kids either, because sometimes they would steal 

things. Someti mes, you -- you know, you were supposed to work with them. I had s -- 
a 

kid who were helping me on the tractor, and he wouldn™t work very well, and I t hought , 

ﬁOh, he™s a rotten ki d.ﬂ When I think back of it now, I cannot even imagine that I didn™t 
realize, that I didn™t have the compassion. There were two ladies in the kibbutz, who were 
Holocaust survivors from camps. One, Margit, big woman, would scream at night in her 

dreams. And aft -- you know, when we heard i t the first ti me, we™d say, ﬁWho was this 

screaming last night, this awful screaming?ﬂ ﬁOh that™s -- that™s Margit, she™s dreaming 

about the camps, oh yeah.ﬂ That was it. And I think about that now, I can™t even i magine 

that either, t hat it di dn™t ring a bell , it didn™t do anything, it -- oh well , that was t he 

Holocaust survi 
-- we had a father on a -- a father of one of the members of the kibbutz, 
an old man, he had been in the camps. Every meal, he would take from the communal 

dining room, he would take pieces of bread, and put them in his pocket, take them to his 

room and hide them. It was a big joke. Abba B ower. Abba Bower, who would take bread. 

You look back and you don™t understand i t. I guess we -- we were busy. We were busy 

working, we were busy building a family, we 
--
 we were busy wit h our children, we were 
busy having fun someti mes. We were busy sitt ing on the lawn in the evening, and talking 

about the neighbors, and about Holland, and how much of what we di d in our chi ldhood, 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
59
 
 
 
 
and the fun we had, and -- and remembering old class songs, or stuff like that. Nobody 
mentioned a word about what had happened to us. And Carla™s brother had gone t hrough 

the Holocaust, he was i n hiding with her, he was there. 

Q: Was it considered a weakness to dwell on that, or -- 

A: I think i t probably was. There 
--
 There are many -- I mean, thi s is in hindsight now, of 
course, and I™ve heard -- we all have heard now, the stori es of -- that the Holocaust 
survivors weren™t parti cularly welcome in Israel after the war, because the y represented 
defeat, and what Israel was about was vict ory. And then there were these people who 

kept on talking about the horrors they had seen, and nobody wanted t o hear this. Nobody 

wanted to hear the stories. And the hidden chil dren -- 
that t erm by ca 
-- didn™t exi st, of 
course, but those who had been in hiding, we -- when you heard a story from a -- 
from a 

Holocaust survivor who had been in Auschwit z, you weren™t going to talk about, he y, I 

was in a room for two and a half years. They would laugh. Noth ing happened to you. You 
weren™t in the camps, you didn™t see anybody die, did you? No, but -- anyway. No, it -- I 
guess there was something like that, but I™m not sure that that influenced us at all. We 

lived with a little group of o-other Dutch ki bbutzniki m, some of who had also gone 

through hi ding, and we worked hard, we got children, and we didn™t talk about the war, 

talked about everything but the war. Talked about the crummy bastards in the ki bbutz 

who were freeloading, on -- on us who were working so hard, and they talked about the -- 
the guy, the sadana wit ha the guy who put s you in work places every day, and he alwa ys

gave you the lousy jobs. And talked about tractors, that they weren™t working right, or 
stuff like that. Years went -- went by talki ng about that.  

Q: So you™re -- After t he war, you know, you -- you sort of welcome this, you know 

Zionism, and -- and identified in that way with -- did it feel like gi ving up a -- a dream, or 

was it the [indecipherable] 

A: Wait a minute, I didn™t get that. Sa y it 
--
 Would you reformulate that? 
Q: After the war you -- you were a Zionist, and you [indecipherable] 

A: Yes.  

Q: -- these groups. And so your experience i n Israel, did that sort of -- [indecipherable] 

A: Cure me of Zionism? 

Q:   or --  

A: I guess I wasn™t enough of an idealist t o sti ck it out. Life in a kibbutz was hard. Carla 

would have liked to stay. I opted for leaving Israel. She sai d she woul d have sta yed. As a 
mat ter of fact, she once said that someone in the kibbutz, and I never found out who it 
was, some man had sai d, ﬁWhy don™t you sta y with me? Let Ed go back to United 

States?ﬂ And she decided not to do that.  

Q: Was that  hard for both of you, that conversation about whether to go or sta y? 

A: Yeah, I™m not quite sure, you see, I™m not quite sure what happened there. I had this 

job --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: -- a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing, and this i s tape three, side A. So we 
were just -- you were just on your way back from Holland to the United States. Pick -- 

We can pick up there. 

A: Yeah. We came back, and of course now we had a daughter, and I started looking 

around for a job, and an apart ment, and we -- we found that in the next village where -- 
from where we are ri ght now, in Dobb™s Ferry. And I started a job wit h a -- with an 
instrument  company. Let™s see, a son -- we got a son. He was born here in the -- in here, 

in the area, and we moved from an apartment in Dobb™s Ferry to this house in Hastings, 

36 years ago. In the meantime, I st arted goi ng to school at night. I went to Pratt Institute, 

and got a degree in Industrial desi gn, and started working on Madison Avenue, and then 

got laid off there, because they ran out of work. This is j ust about the time Kennedy got 

assassinated. And t hen I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself. And life went 
on, and Carla started going to school, and she graduated, and she -- she first went -- got a 
Bachelors, and then she got a Master™s from Columbia, and she became a Social Worker. 

And was all -- that was a great accomplishment for us, because we had missed our 

education i n a sense. So now I was free-lancing, and then -- and I got a studio in New 

York City for awhi le, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42
nd
 Street, i n a prestigi ous 
building, a nd a -- we were very busy, and the kids were growing up, and so on and so 

forth. I thought that our life -- m y life would be pretty well without surprises further on. I 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G

looked at it -- I forget what birthday that was, but it™ll be m y 40
th
 -- 
m y 4 0
th
 would 
have 
-- 
would have been in ™66, right? Born in ™26. Anyway, somewhere, one of these birthdays, 
I said, ﬁWell , I think I™ve seen it about.ﬂ You know? Sounds a li ttle cyni cal, but I had a 

big birthday party, and at the end of the da y I thought, probably i t™s going to go on until 

m y death wi -- about the same wa y, you know? With working, and ki ds growing up and 

leaving the home, and so on and so forth, and -- and two t hings happened. Actually, three 
things happened, but -- but the first one happened in -- let me see, I t hink 19 -- 19 -- 
1980. [inaudible] 1980? 1981. My wife got involved with a couple of other ladies in 
setting up a -- something that hadn™t been done before,  a special kind of meeting of 

people who had been in hiding. And now, she was alwa ys involved in reading Holocaust 

literature, and especiall y Dutch is -- tr -- poetry, and stori es writt en by Holocaust 

survivors. I never touched it. My brother sent me the standard work in Holland, about t he 

destruction of the Dutch Jewry, a t wo vol ume book, and i t stood on the shelf. I once 
looked, there were a couple of photographs in it, I was horrified, I put  it back on the shelf, 
never touched it. Anyway, in 1981, she started to organize this -- 
t his business with 
-- but 
before that, there was an article in New York magazine, I™m sure she had -- 
she must 

have told you about all this -- was an article in New York magazine in which there was a 

-- a couple of stories, a bunch of stories of -- of hidden -- what the y suddenly were called, 

hidden children, chi ldren who had been in hiding. It hit t he -- It hit the -- the -- the -- the -

- the -- the media, you know? In short order, CBS, NBC, ABC, the magazines, Time, I 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
don™t know, Newsweek, everybody wanted to know -- a new buzz word there was, 
hidden children, who had ever heard of hidden children? Here we had been for 50 years 

surrounded -- 
now we 
--
 we didn™t think about it ourselves. Anywa y, that™s the time we 
got in -- we got asked t o be interviewed by the Holocaust museum, I guess, and in short  

order we -- 
I got
 onto all kinds of televisi on programs. I was on CNB C, we were -- the 

whole family was on ABC Good Morning America, and -- i t was amazing -- amazi ng 
time. Anyway, the conference was in sight. It was on Memorial Day, 1981, I thi nk. And 
Carla said t o me, ﬁAre you coming to thi s conference?ﬂ She had been very busy 

organizing t his. I had heard the news, you know, and -- and -- 
and I 
--  I think my --   a-
answer was -- is -- i s a classic by now, I -- I said, ﬁAh no, why should I come? I mean, 

you will be busy, running around here -- there -- at the conference, and I™ll just be 

hanging out, you know, waiting ti l it™s over.ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ she said, ﬁyou know, m y brother i s 

especially coming from Israel, and he™ll be wandering around by hi mself. Couldn™t you 
just come?ﬂ And I said, ﬁAll right, all right.ﬂ I™ve been married for many years, you learn 
when to -- when to be acquiescent, you know? And so, there we gathered, on Memorial 

Day weekend, in -- on Ti mes Square in the -- in the Marri ott. And I think it was Friday 
night when the first registration was supposed to be on, and I -- Carla was busy up there 

on the seventh floor. They were -- The y had t he -- like, sort of places where you could 

register. And I posi tioned m yself between t hose windows, where people stood behind 

them, had all these kits for they -- for those who had registered, and the elevators. Now 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
64
 
 
 
 
the elevators i-i-in -- in that hotel are made out of glass, sort of. They -- They -- They rise 
from -- 
from 
-- from the bottom on the -- i n -- in an atrium. And t hen, when the y come to 

the floor, the y open up, and the y di sgorge their people. And I stood there, and I watched 

the elevators bringi ng up these people, these gra y haired men and women, of all kinds of 

heights and sizes, and girth, and -- and then I saw them go to the -- to the windows there, 
where the volunteers of -- were standing, and t hey were get ting their kits, and then they 
got the tags, and the y put the tags on, and the y wrote on t here where 
--
 who the y were, 
and where t he y had been in hiding. And I can™t -- to this da y I cannot explain to you, but  
as the y got -- started to crowd around on the floor, and I began to read their tags, sort of 

furtively, you know, I wasn™t wit h anyone, and the y began to form groups and talk, and I 

looked at the tags, and the tags sai d, I was hidden in Belgium, I was hidden in France, I 

was hidden in Holland. I came from Poland, I came from Romania. And this -- 
very 

strange, but  I began to cry. I began to cry, and it was to me as if I always had believed 
that I was t he only one who had been in hi ding. Is a thing so strange, I mean, I knew, you 
know.I mean, my o 
-- m y own brothers, and friends, and everybody had been -- but here 
they were, t he hidden children, s -- 1600 of them. And they crowded around, and they 

talked, and I just st ood and looked at them, and I cried. And the y were suddenly like I 

had all these brothers and sisters, but of course, I had very little in common with most of 

them, sum -- you know. There was very litt le in common between somebody who has 

been in hi --  in hidi ng i n Poland, and somebody who has been hi 
--
 in hiding in -- in

France, let™s sa y, or in Belgium. The situation w-were vastly different, but it didn™t 
mat ter. And the conference started up, and Carla™s brother came, and we sat in the 

conference,
 1600 peopl e, we listened to Abe Foxman, you know, of the Anti-Defamation 
League, who was a hidden child. And we l istened to other people. And I cried, and 

everybody cried. I cri ed for three days. Something magical happened there. I, who had 

never read a book on the Holocaust , I suddenly was -- it was like, I don™t know, l ike m y 
mind opened up suddenl y to something that I could -- you asked me, did you t -- earlier, 
did you tal k about the war, either i n New Yor -- in -- in t he Zionist organization or in the 

kibbutz? Never a word. Carla and I didn™t t alk about the war with each other. And it 

happened there. It changed my life. I -- It went  on for three da ys, and wherever I went, I 

talked with people, and the y talked to me, and I got to tell  you funny thing, t
hat people 

never stopped talki ng, and the y couldn™t get enough of telling what happened to t hem, as 

if they had never -- 
as if 
-- as if they had never told it to anyone, you know. Or maybe 
they didn™t. It was 
--
 It was so bad, I stood in t he men™s room next to a guy -- next -- the -
- the guy next to me in the urinal said to me, ﬁSo, where were you in hiding?ﬂ And I said 
in Holland. I said, ﬁSo where were you in hidi ng?ﬂ He said, ﬁI was in Poland.ﬂ And we 

talked while we peed. And even t here, you didn™t stop 
talking with 
--
 and -- and 
[indecipherable] what happened to me, and then we zipped up, and then we talked some 

more outside. It was astounding. It was an astounding experience. And when it was over, 

three da ys later, we left, and it was as if I had suddenly acquired, you know, like 1600 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
66
 
 
 
 
sisters and brothers. I didn™t want t o leave. Nobody wanted to leave. There were people 
sitting downstairs in the lobby that -- that cried because it was over. When you ask people 

today, who were at t hat  conference, the y all remember it exactly. I was there. I 

experienced it. It was as if the door suddenly opened, after 50 years. It  was as if we were 

suddenly al lowed to remember. Anywa y, I went home, it was very strange, as -- 
t he car 

was in the garage downstairs, as I drove out, an enormous thunderstorm broke out over 
Manhattan. The sky was blue with lightning every second, and the rai n poured down, and 
it thundered b-between those buil dings, i t sounded -- it was like hell had broken loose, i t 

was like God himself sort of thundered out on -- on us for -- you know, it was very 

strange. Got home, started reading every -- every book, every pamphlet, every st ory I 

could la y my hands on. And my life changed. It -- It™s never been t he same. I became a 

speaker, became an int erviewer for a -- Spielberg™s Shoah Foundation. I -- 
I™m a
- about 
the best speaker the y have of the Hidden Child Foundati on. I spoke last month at the 
commemoration at the Supreme C ourt of New York state, to the j udges and the lawyers. 
It™s -- All t his happened af ter that day. So --  

Q: Let me ask you, based on -- on what has happened since then, and that you™ve become 

so involved, do you look back on al l those years of not talking about i t, and wonder why 

you and man -- and many others didn™t really discuss the sto
ry?
 
A: Yes, of course I have, and there™s all sorts of theories about it. If you ask Carla, who is 

a Social Worker, and who psychol ogically knows much more than I do, you heard her 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
67
 
 
 
 
say earlier, when we were talking about it, briefly, about needing four decades to -- to be 
able to talk about it , but that -- that  still doesn™t -- I still don™t underst and. But th -the 

experience is -- I™m not the only one. There are so many who sai d -- I™ve interviewed 

people myself, not hidden children, but the camp survivors, who said, ﬁAh, Mr. Lessing, 

this is the first ti me that I will be speaking about it. I™ve never spoken about it like this 

with anyone else.ﬂ What is it? I don™t know. I -- I -- Really, I™m st upi d, as far as that™s 
concerned, I have -- I have no idea why it t ook 50 years for me, but it -- for me there was 
a definite epiphany, that -- that moment there, I could look, I could take you to t he place 

on that floor in the Marriott Marquis on Times Square, and sa y, here™s where I stood. 

Here is where suddenly everything changed. No, no, come back in another 10 years, 

ma ybe I™ll have an answer. Ma ybe Carla had an answer, I™m not quit e sure. Anyway, I 

became quite active, sl owly, not 
--
 not i mmediately, but Carla, of course, had the -- 
became vice
- president of The Hidden Child Foundation, and I -- I began to -- and she 
formed a group here in Westchester, and I deci ded that m y forte was ma ybe writi ng some 

things, I have written li ttle pieces, and I began to write a newsletter, every month I write a 

newsletter, t here™s only two pages, but I love t o write a lit tle editorial for it, and I™ve 

written those, and 
--
 and then later I started a newsletter, same thing, t wo page newsletter 
for The Hidden Chi ld Foundation in New York, and that has a circulation of about 3,000 

people, and that goes around, you know, the -- the whole New York region. That™s my 

involvement, and t he speaking -- t he speaking involvement is much more intense. I spoke 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
68
 
 
 
 
to, I don™t know, ma ybe 15 - 20 places thi s -- during the Holocaust commemoration 
season, you know, these -- these speech da ys come in seasons. Anyway, t hat was one -- 

one thing t hat changed my life. Now, I got  to go to something very i mportant. That was 

in 19 -- was that 1990, or 1991, the big [inaudi ble] 1991 --  1981, I thi nk. In 1982, ther
e 

was a decisi on that in 
--
 of the Dutch Jews, that the y would hold a conference for hidden 
children in Amsterdam. And of course we were invited to come, and of course we 
decided, you know, we were hidden children from Holland, so Carla and I decided yes, 
we will go there. Okay, tickets, airline tickets and so on, so forth, and -- about two 

months before -- 
about two monthser 
-- before the conference, I decided that -- 
are you 
comfortable? You coul d lean back, ma ybe, if that™s easier for you.  

Q: No, that™s fine. 

A: Are you okay? 

Q: Yeah.  
A: About a month and a half, or two mont hs before conference in Amsterdam, I suddenly 
decided that I had actuall y never said enough -- given enough thanks to one man in 

Holland, who had helped me save m y life. I don™t know if you remember I talked to you 

about a pol ice officer, Oskam, a great model of a naz -- Dutch Nazi, but he was really a 

wonderful guy. I thought, I wonder if Oskam i s still li -- I didn™t know his name. I 

wonder if that police officer is still alive. And I couldn™t find his name in my mind. I 

asked my brother Fred, who did al l the int erviews, he sai d, ﬁYeah, somet hing like 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
69
 
 
 
 
Boscamp, or something like that.ﬂ Anyway, I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec -- 
documentat ion in Amsterdam, and said -- described the hut where I had been, and 

described Oskam, and I sent a little picture, a little photograph of Oskam, his wife, and 

their son, who was then three and a half, four years old, and sent it off to war document -- 

and asked them, is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp, or whatever his name is still alive, and I 

described him. And I got a letter back that said, ﬁNo, we™re sorry, but that gentleman has 
died, and so -- his wife has also died. But his son, Oskam junior is still alive, and he™s a 
retired plumber, and we sent your letter wi th the photograph, on to hi m.ﬂ So I got a letter 

back from Oskam, juni or. And he said, ﬁMr. Lessing, I don™t know who you are, but I™m 

very grateful for the little photograph you sent me, I™ve never seen that photograph.ﬂ Of 

course he hadn™t, because I had taken it just before I left for the United States. And he 

said, ﬁWhat can I do for you?ﬂ And I said t o him, ﬁI™m sorry your father died, but I would 

like to, when I come to Holland for the conference, I would like t o get together with you , 
and talk about your father, he -- who saved my life, you know.ﬂ And I got a letter back 
from him, it said, ﬁWell listen, I was only four -- four, four and a half years old, and I 

don™t know much. My father was a very closed man. I -- I don™t know what to 
--
 what I 
could tell you.ﬂ And I said, ﬁI don™t  really care, but I would like t o find out a little bit 

about your father, who was he, what -- what background did he come from.ﬂ Suddenly, I 

-- it had to do with the whole hidden children business, too. Suddenly I decided I must 

find out about what happened to me. I must find out what happened t o all the Jews duri ng

the Holocaust, and here was a chance. So I wrote to him, we™re comi ng to Holland, and 
can we meet with you. And he sai d, ﬁYeah, okay. I don™t know what I can do for you, but  

oka y.ﬂ We go on the plane, and we are 10 minutes awa y from Amsterdam airport 

Schiphol, and the captain comes on. As the y always do, it™s, ﬁLadi es and gentlemen, 

thank you for flying KLM, we™ll be landi ng i n 10 minut es in Schiphol, and don™t forget 

any of your stuff,ﬂ whatever, you know. And I burst out i n crying -- cryi ng, next to Carla. 
I™m sobbing sitting there. She said, ﬁWhat happened, what ™s the matter?ﬂ I said, ﬁThis 
shit makes no sense at all, but when we land, when this plane land in Schiphol, I see at 

the end of the runwa y, there™s a line of black t rucks, with SS, waiting for me, and the y 

will kill me.ﬂ A direct remembrance of the morning of the raid in the woods. And she 

said, ﬁWell, you know that that™s not true.ﬂ I said, ﬁI know that™s not true,ﬂ but that™s how 

I felt it. It was like 
--
 It was like I was right  back there, you know? Well, we wer 
--
 
We 
landed, of course, and my cousin was there with her little blue Honda, and of course the 
SS disappeared from my mind. Anywa y, the next da y we meet Oskams, junior. By thi s 
time I found out the name is Oskam, not Boscamp, and Oskam j u -- Oskam junior, who 

doesn™t look at all l ike his father, but he looks like his mother, you know, have a round 

face, and round body, and very jolly guy, and he™s a retired plumber, and then we meet 

hi m in thi s tiny li ttle doll™s house, like the y have in Holland. The whole house fits about 

in this -- in this room, you know? And the y have the coffee, and the cake, as alwa ys in 

Holland, youknow, yo
u have to eat coffee, and you know, and big cakes with great

almond paste in it, lovel y. And we sitting down, and we meet his wife, and -- so he said, 
ﬁWhat can I do for you?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell I -- I didn™t know who your father was, real ly, 

because it was all so secret.ﬂ And he tells me a little bit about his father, and it comes out  

that Oskam came from a family of all Nazis, Dutch Nazis, and bad ones, anti-Semites. 

People who tried to discover where Jews were hidden, and found them, and -- and 

denounced them to the Germans. The worst. The whole family was one big heap of 
garbage, you know? He was the only good one. But because the whole family was so 
bad, his reputation was -- was bad 
--
 for the Germans was excellent, because he came 
from this virulent Nazi f amily, the y thought he was so too, and when 
--
 when I show you 
a picture of hi m, he looks like it, l ike a Nazi in black uniform, and everything. He was a 

good man. Anywa y, we™re talking, and he t ell s me about this br -- his father, and then -- 

and then I s aid, ﬁLi sten, did you know there was a hut in the woods not far from here?ﬂ 

And he sai d, ﬁYes, I -- I knew that, my father told me that .ﬂ I said, ﬁDid you know who 
was in the hut?ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, I don™t know. My father didn™t tel l me too much about it.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁYou didn™t know that I was in there?ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, I -- 
I don™t.ﬂHesaid to me, 

ﬁWhy are you asking me these questions?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I had this crazy idea,ﬂ -- all this 

comes after the revelati ons in 1991, the conference. I -- I had to find out everythi ng now. 

I said, ﬁI thought if maybe there were a group of men in t here, and I probably saw them 

for the last ti me when they were ali ve. And I t hought maybe a brother or a sister, or 

ma ybe even a father or a mother might sti ll be alive, and I could tel l them at least, for that

last morni ng, when we ran into the hut and warned them, and,ﬂ -- and he™s listeni ng to 
me, and he says to me, ﬁBut Mr. Lessing, I just want to tell you something wrong with 

your story.ﬂ I s -- And I thought, ﬁWhat the hell does he know? He was four years old at 

the ti me.ﬂ I-
I 
-- I said, ﬁWhat do you mean there™s something wrong with m y st ory?ﬂ He 

said, ﬁWell, I don™t know much what happened there,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut I know one thing. 

Nobody was arrested t hat morning. The y all escaped.ﬂ Now, you™ve got to realize, for 50 
years I have lived with the idea, on and off, not every day, not every week, but at least 
once a month, I would think about the morning of the raid on the hut, and how we 

stormed in, my buddy and I, and warned the men, and pulled the blankets off them, and 

shouted, ﬁIt ™s a raid, it™s the SS, get up, t he Germans are here.ﬂ And then, when we saw 

that they were all up and out and awake, we fled. And alwa ys the question came up, we 

should have stayed, maybe. We should have stayed with them, helped them more. But 

then it went in my mind, then, not the seven that were there, but we would have been 
caught, too, and we™d have been killed. Thi s way, there were seven ki lled, at least  two 
escaped. And that went  on through the yea rs, this feeling of guilt that we -- I didn™t sta y 

long enough. I should have spent more ti me there. I -- I -- So what? I might have been 

killed with them, but -- but then t hat didn™t make any sense. We di d warn them, and you 

know, and we did our best, and so we couldn™t help it, you know, this kind of stuff. And 

here this man tells me t hey all escaped. So inst ead of being guilty of ma ybe not doing 

enough, it now comes out, I™ve actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives. So, I

come out of that conference with this man -- t his man, and m y cousi n is there, and she 
says, ﬁSo, how was it?ﬂ I said, ﬁYou can™t -- I can™t believe this. The men whom I 

thought were killed, all survived.ﬂ ﬁGod,ﬂ she says, ﬁthat™s amazing. Who were they?ﬂ I 

said, ﬁHe didn™t know. I don™t know either.ﬂ By t he wa y, I should backtrack for one 

second. At the begi nning of the conference of my talk -- it is not a conference, but a talk 

with -- with Oskam junior, he said, ﬁMr. Lessi ng, I went into the basement to see if 
there™s an yt hing I could find on m y father, and you know, there were thousands of paper 
m y father had gathered through the years. They were all the old ticket s that he had given 

to people,ﬂ you know, where you don™t have a -- you don™t have a na -- 
an a 
-- license 
plate in the back of your car, or people didn™t have a l -- a li ght on t he front of their 

bicycle, and there were thousands of those tickets, or copies of tickets. And he sai d, ﬁI 

threw all those awa y. I saved a few things,ﬂ and he came up with a picture. ﬁBut,ﬂ he 

says, ﬁI have somet hing here, and i t had -- was sent to m y father by your mother.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁMy mother? From where?ﬂ He says, ﬁI don™t know. It looks like from Africa someplace. 
Algiers?ﬂ He fishes out -- now thi s is 1992 I™m talking about, so i t™s seven years ago, he 

digs out of there a postcard sent by my mother, to his father, sa yi ng that she came out of 

Bergen-Belsen, she doesn™t know what™s the mat -- what -- what happened to her 

husband and s -- and her -- and her three sons. She wonder if they™re still alive. Would he 

know something more? And he hands me t his postcard, it was like a postcard you get 

after somebody dies, and it reaches you. It wasn™t addressed to me, but it was m y

mother™s, she had writt en it, you know? She had typed it on the office t ypewriter there. I 
have it here. That™s how it started out already. He sa ys, ﬁThis something that int erests 

you?ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat do you mean i t interest s me? This is from my mot her. She sent it 

after she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she,ﬂ 
--
 I don™t know, it™s amazing, anywa y. You 
see, life was full of surprises, and -- so anyway, as I said, m y cousin said, ﬁDo you know 

who was i n the c -- in 
--
 in that hut?ﬂ I said no. She said t o me, ﬁYou know, there™s a 
radio program on here, comes on once a week, on Frida y morning, it™s called Address 

Unknown, goes on the Catholic radio stati on, and the y interview people, there™s a guy 

who intervi ews people, and -- who are sic -- looking for people the y have lost years ago.ﬂ 

I said, ﬁYeah, well, you know, I l ost people 50 years ago. Sh -- Who the hell would 

know?ﬂ And she said, ﬁOh, you could try.ﬂ So I call up the radio station, and I got a -- got 

the producer on the phone, and -- very nice lady, and she said -- I tol d -- I told her a little 

bit about t his story, and she said, ﬁThat™s a fascinating st ory, Mr. Lessing. Are you going 
to be here next month?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I --  I™m here just for a conference, I™m -- got to go 
back to the United Stat es.ﬂ And, she said, ﬁAh, that™s too bad, because it takes us about a 

mon t
h to put program t ogether, you know. We have already,ﬂ and so on, so forth. You 
probably know all about this, and -- oka y, we went to the conference -- there™s something 

else I didn™t  tell you, and I shoul d tell you about it. I don™t --

Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing. This i s tape three, side B. You 
were just talking about going back to Holl and. 

A: I said, ﬁNo, I have t o go back t o the United States.ﬂ And we went t o the conference. 

We went to visit a lady in Brussel s who was -- played a part in a friend of mine™s life, and 

-- which I haven™t told you about, and I sort of should backtrack on that later, because it™s 

an i mportant part al so, what happened to me. Anyway, we go to 
the conference, we come 
back to my cousin agai n, who lives in the center of Holland. She l ives, by the way, very 

close to where I had been in hiding in the -- in the hut, and where Oskam junior lives, 

that™s all around Ut recht, the area t he y™re in now. So, she sa ys, ﬁCall the radio station, 

they™ve been calling here all -- all -- all the ti me.ﬂ So I call them up, I get the producer 

upon the phone. ﬁYeah, Mr. Lessi ng, we 
--
 we -- we decided that your story is so 
fascinating. Could you comenext Frida y mornin
g?ﬂ I said, ﬁSure.ﬂ So, Frida y morning 

very early, Carla and I went to the radio st ation, and m y cousin went also with us, and -- 
and I said t o m y -- said, ﬁCarla,ﬂ I said, ﬁthi s i s a waste of ti me,ﬂ sit 
--
 sitting there talking 
about something that happened 50 years ago, who the hell woul d remember an obscure 
hut in an obscure piece of wood somewhere in an obscure little vil lage?ﬂ You™re going to 

get that on. So -- But we were there, and there™s a guy, he was sort of like -- you could 

say a little bit like, oh, t he Letterman of the -- of the Dutch air waves, a very popular 

man. Hans Frombi lihamber, Hans Frombilihamber, should put his name in here. And 

Hans seats me there, sit s me down, and this is an hour program. The y make a break after 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
76
 
 
 
 
the half hour, and t hen the y gave our telephone number, and then people can call i n if 
they have any -- have any [indecipherable]. Anywa y, he i nterviews me, and I tell hi m the 

story about the hiding in the woods, and t he -- the raid, and I tell hi m about finding 

Oskam junior back, and about the terrible surprise, or the wonderful surprise, to find out 

that I didn™t -- what  sa y -- did do enough, t hat I helped those people --  to save seven 

people, to save their lives, and -- and -- and he makes a break, and they play some music, 
and then the program goes on, and at the end, he sa ys, ﬁWell, thank you very much,ﬂ and 
he -- ﬁI™ll show you where we have t he telephone.ﬂ So we go back to a room, and the y 

have a dozen telephones there, and they have six people. And the y do this every week, by 

the wa y, it™s been going on for years. There™s six people, the y take the telephone calls, 

and the y write on slips whatever call  comes in. And so, I come there, and these dozen 

phones are ringing off the hook. And they™ve got a little st ack of slips already this big. 

And the y ask me, you know, as it goes on, as the y™re writi ng it, ﬁIs t his something?ﬂ And 
they hold i t in front of me. And there was very strange things. There™s a -- 
ﬁYes, m y 
-- 
m y sister was in t here, in the hut with a dog,ﬂ You know, I  -- there™s all kinds of stupid 

things. But, there was one -- th-there were several that were very int eresting, one -- once -

- one was -- said, ﬁMy brother was with you i n the hut, but he is -- doesn™t live here any 

more in Holland, he i -- lives now in Indonesia, and he -- I™m sure he would love to hear 

from you.ﬂ His name on -- Herman Mueni nghof. Okay, I don™t know Herman 

Mueninghof, you know, but might be true. And a little later, another message comes in, it 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
77
 
 
 
 
says, ﬁI was with you i n the hut, and I™m listening to thi s broadcast, and I live ri ght 
around the corner from the radio station. Please come and visit me afterwards.ﬂ Lou 

Fontichili n. I don™t know Lou Fontichilin, but it sa ys he was there. So anyway, we got -- 

the phone keeps on ringing, and finla -- finall y it  dies down, and -- and I got thi s big stack 

of p-pieces of paper, and the y -- not only --  that -- that™s not where it stops for them, any 

messages t hat are i mportant, they research, no mat ter where the y are. The y go all over the 
world, find these peopl e, and make contact wi th them. Oka y, so it was wonderful. We get  
into my cousin™s little blue Honda, and we go around the corner, and I ring the door of an 

apartment house, and t his huge woman comes out, and throws her arms around me, and 

says, ﬁEddi e, I didn™t think you would make it.ﬂ I said, ﬁWho are you?ﬂ She said, ﬁDon™t 

you remember me?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ She sa ys, ﬁMy name was Perk.ﬂ Her secret name was 

Perk during the war, ﬁBut,ﬂ she says, ﬁI kept it. Cut me -- Call me Perk Fontichilar. And I 

remember you very well,ﬂ she sa ys. ﬁI used to be courier for the underground.ﬂ Vaguely I 
began to remember somet hing. She sa ys, ﬁCome, Lou wants to meet you.ﬂ Leads me into 
the living room, and there™s an old man sit ting, with whit e hair, but I i mmediately 

recognized him as one of the men I had left behind that morning. Ah, we cried, and we 

hugged, and we did, and -- I tell you, it was like -- couldn™t believe it, that all this was 

happening. Well, finall y we settled down, and his wife brought some coffee, of course, 

and -- and we talked about the morning, and he said he ran awa y in hi s pajamas, and -- 

and without shoes, and everyone managed t o get out. I said, ﬁLou, who were the people 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
78
 
 
 
 
who were i n the hut?ﬂ And he said, ﬁWell, I have some photographs that I took in the 
hut.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou do?ﬂ He said, ﬁYes, I™ll show you.ﬂ And he -- his wife brought out a 

box of photographs, and there was photographs with all t he men i n the hut, and not only 

that, but also the Canadian, and the Englishman, the fl yers from t he RAF on there. But I 

wasn™t on t here. And he said, ﬁBut I also have a picture of you.ﬂ I says, ﬁYou do?ﬂ And 

yes, and he came out with a photograph of -- of me standing in the hut, c ynical young 
man .
 
Q: Can you describe it for me? 
A: Well, what you™re seeing here is -- looking at the bunk beds, t he upright post s are 

made from pine trees that were cut by the men, and you can see t here™s an upper bunk, 

somebody™s si-sit ting on there eating a sandwi ch, and there™s a lower bunk, where 

somebody™s eating an apple, or something like that, and I™m leaning against one of the 

posts of the bed, in shorts, and a woolen jacket, and I™m l ooking directl y into the camera. 
I™m the -- this man that I was talki ng with, had taken this photograph. It was taken in the 
fall of 1943, before the hut was raided. Now, I said to Lou -- and he described all the 

men, and their names. So now I knew who had been in the hut. And t hen I ask him the 

final question, I said, ﬁLou, everything is revealed except one thing. Who was m y buddy, 

who w
as my partnerthat morning,whostood guardwith methat morning,who escaped? 

Who was t he man who my mother gave her bicycl e to, and -- and t he flashlight?ﬂ And he 

said, ﬁI don™t know, don™t you know?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ He said, ﬁDon™t you remember 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
79
 
 
 
 
anyt hing of hi m?ﬂ I sai d, ﬁI seem to remember a man who was a shoemaker in the regular 
life.ﬂ And he said, ﬁOh, well, he wasn™t a shoemaker, his father was a shoemaker, and his 

name was,ﬂ -- I said, ﬁWhat was his name?ﬂ He says, ﬁHis name was Jan Carman, Jan 

Carman.ﬂ So now I knew who had been my buddy. I said, ﬁWhere i s he, what happened 

to hi m?ﬂ He said, ﬁEd, I don™t think you™re -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me 

that morning. We fled t ogether.ﬂ I said, ﬁLou, it can™t be, he was with me. I think your 
mem
ory must be mixed up.ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, ma ybe it is, you know, it™s years ago, and 
I™m old, and,ﬂ -- I said, ﬁWhat happened to Jan Carman?ﬂ He said, ﬁHe was with me 
three weeks later, we were raided in -- in unrel ated raid on a house wi th Jews, and he was 

-- he was taken, and he was executed in the dunes. And he is buri ed in the cemetery for 

the martyrs, the -- of the Resistance, in Holland.ﬂ So the picture changed again. The man 

who were de -- who I t hought were dead, were -- had -- had lived, the two who had 

escaped, one -- one had been caught, and was 
--
 was execut ed. So, wit h that, I went one 
more 
-- once more back with -- with Oskam j unior, to the place where the hut had been. 

And then I knew 50 years had gone by, because where there had been an i mpenetrable 

wood of young pi ne trees, now there was a forest you could look right through, with tall 

pine trees, and you could walk right through it . It poured that morning. It rained cats and 

dogs. I had a yellow slicker, and one of these plastic coats over me, and it poured, it was 

a dismal da y. And we went to where the hut had been, and the only t hing there was was a 

slight depression i n the ground. I tried to find a splinter of wood, a lit tle piece of glass, 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
80
 
 
 
 
something to take back, and there was nothing. And then finally he took me to t he edge 
of the wood, where I st ood that morning and watched the Germans come, and I stood 

there in the rain, and they distanced themselve a little bit 
--
 
therewas some more people 
there. There were people from the 
--
 the -- t he nursing home next door. Anywa y 
--
 and I 
stood there, at the same place where I had stood that -- you know. And you know, it™s 

weird, and it sound very dramatic, but it -- I stood there, and it was al most as if I could 
hear tires coming up again, up on t he road. It was scary, it was scary being there. Must 
have been a little bit  like Holocaust  survivors going back to Auschwi tz, you know? 

Anywa y, t here is -- there™s too much to tell, because it™s all in little details, there 
--
 the 
ones who had given us food during the da ys when we were in the hut, were the nuns next 

door. Next to the wood was a fence, and then next to that, there was a -- what do the y cal l 

that, where nuns li ve? 

Q: A convent. 
A: The convent. And t he sisters at  the convent, every da y put food next to the fence, and 
we had cut a hole in it, and I woul d -- was one of the persons who was designated to 

bring the food to t he hut. In the meanti me, it had been converted from a convent to a 

nursing home for older nuns, and for other Cat holics, and these peopl e had heard the 

broadcast. The y had never known what had happened next  door t o them. And so, I was 

invited to come to there, and we di d that, and then I met some people who had been -- 

that same day had been incarcerated by the SS, who had j ust been caught hanging around. 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
81
 
 
 
 
The gardener, for instance, of the grounds of the convent had been -- he had come to see 
what was going on, he was thrown in jail. The Mother Superior, they had knocked on the 

door of the convent, and when she opened the door, they said, ﬁWe want to come in,ﬂ and 

-- the SS said, and she had said, ﬁYou have nothing to li -- look for here,ﬂ and the y 

slapped her in the face, and she fell on the ground, and the y walked right over her, and 

threw her in jail for three months, also. And Oskam, the policeman, was found walking 
around wit h a gun, which he was al lowed t o have, but in civilian clothes, because he had 
heard about the raid. And the y took hi m in for awhile, he came back three weeks l ater, 

emaciated, and beaten up, and all this stuff was coming out of what had happened that 

day. Anyway, it was time to go back to the United States. I came -- I had -- I had a bunch 

of photographs from Lou, and I had made a whole slew of new friends from the radio 

station, and -- and from, you know, the people, and it was all wonderful. And so Carla 

and I went back, and I settled down here, i n this room, and I™m sitting right here working, 
in December, 1992, I get a call. ﬁHi , this is Hans Frontikel in Holland, from the radio 
station,remember me, I™m 
-- I interviewed you?ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, how you doing, Hans?ﬂ 
ﬁFine. I wonder if you could come to Holl and, I have a TV program, and we™re going to 

do a half an hour on the -- the Dutch Resistance, and also about t he Jewish persecution, 

and I thought you, being involved in both, maybe I could interview you again, but now 

on television.ﬂ I sai d, ﬁYeah, well that™s very nice, but I don™t have a budget to go for 20 

minutes to Amsterdam.ﬂ ﬁOh no,ﬂ he said, ﬁwe pa y your flight, and we pa y your hotels 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
82
 
 
 
 
and everything.ﬂ I said, ﬁI™ll be there.ﬂ And so all of a sudden I found m yself back in s -- 
in December, and this i s what happened. H-Hans, m y interviewer send his -- wh-what is 

it called, his -- 
the guy you 
-- an -- an editor. Tall guy, and he said, ﬁEd, I would like to 

go over the story once more with you, just qui ckly, for the interview, the da y after 

tomorrow.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ I said, ﬁFirst of all,ﬂ -- no, I -- I -- I -- I sai d, ﬁOkay, but,ﬂ I 

said, ﬁ you know the story.ﬂ ﬁYeah, we sed -- li ke to -- tell me a little bit shortly, again.ﬂ 
And so I said, ﬁWell,ﬂ [indecipherable], it was in the camp, and [indecipherable] you 
know, and we got raided, and I was -- was out with a buddy, andﬂ -- and he said, ﬁDo you 

know who your buddy was?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I didn™t know in August, but now I™ve heard 

that it was a cert -- 
a 
-- a certain Jan Carman.ﬂ And the y said, ﬁWhat happened to hi m?ﬂ 
And he sai d -- I -- I -- I s -- I said, ﬁHe was shot in the dunes. He is buried, and,ﬂ I said, ﬁI 

visited his grave yesterday.ﬂ I had i n the mean time, gone to the graveyard of the 

Resistance people, and there I cried over Jan™s grave, and -- and -- Tong was his name, 
Tong, the editor. He sai d, ﬁOka y,ﬂ he said, ﬁnow, the da y after tomorrow, I™ll come and 
pick you up, and first we™ll go to the mu seum of the Dutch Resistance.ﬂ I said, ﬁOh.ﬂ 

ﬁOh,ﬂ he sai d, ﬁwell, I want to show you a film t here, and,ﬂ -- okay. So, we went there, 

and I sat there, and t his was in the former synagogue, and so I sat there, and I watched 

this film, which seemed like an ol d film, i t di dn™t seem -- I said, ﬁWhy are you showing 

me this?ﬂ ﬁWell,ﬂ he said, ﬁI was t old to do thi s,ﬂ and I couldn™t figure it out, you know? 

Anywa y, when it was over, we went to the TV studio, and there on the set was a nice 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
83
 
 
 
 
thick couch, and on the end of the couch was a little Christ mas tree, cause the program 
was going to be aired on -- on Christmas day. And it was a live audience. Oskam junior 

and his wife was there, and my cousin wit h her husband were there, and as -- 
m y second 
cousin from -- from The Hague come over. And I was al one, Carl a hadn™t come with me 

ya 
--
 you know. So, the lights went on, and there was Hans with a nice  Christ mas tie, and 
me, in little -- nice littl e Jewish boy, sitti ng next to a Christ mas tree. So, by then I had 
been on TV a couple of times, and I had some idea, you know, I was here on channel 13, 
and I™ve been there wit h CNBC, and a couple other places, and -- and so I sort of knew 

what the routine was, you know, and the i nterviewer asks the questions, and you give t he 

right answers, you know, and don™t embarrass anybody, and you don™t be idiot, you 

know. So, he said, ﬁMr. Lessing, many will remember you from t his summer, when I 

interviewed you on radio, but now here you are again, and I want to ask you a few 

questions.ﬂ And so he asked me where I was during the war. I said I was in hidi ng. And 
where were you in hidi ng? I -- Well , I was, among other places, was in this hut. And what 
happened? Well, we were raided. And -- And the interview went along fine, you know, 

standardized. By then I got a little bit, shall I say, blasé about the whole thing, you know? 

But it was fun to be there, and -- and he said, ﬁSo, Mr. Lessing, what happened?ﬂ I said, 

ﬁWell, we stood guard, a buddy of mine, and 
--
 and -- and I, and we happened to see the 
Germans coming, and we went back and warned the others, and,ﬂ 
--
 he said, ﬁDo you 
know who your buddy was?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell yes, he is Jan Carman, and he -- I visit ed his 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
84
 
 
 
 
grave yesterday, and he got executed by the Germans, near the dunes in Holland.ﬂ And 
then he said something that did not fit in the thing, and he said, ﬁMr. Lessing, I want to 

tell you that we have received a part of a diary of the man 
--
 your buddy, your partner 
who stood guard with you that morning, describing that morning, the raid, and 

everything, just like you tell it.ﬂ And I thought for a second, and I t hought, he is wrong, 

that can™t be. Cause Jan Carman™s date on his grave sa ys he was 
--
 he was execut ed in 
February, 1945 -- 1944, and we were raided on the 29
th
 of December, 1943. There had 
only been a couple of weeks in between, and he was on the run al l the ti me, I knew that 

from Lou. So I thought this -- something -- somet hing is screwed up here, and -- 
but, you 
know, live audience, you™re not going to -- so I said, ﬁOh.ﬂ And t hen he said something 

that really chilled me to the bone. He said, ﬁMr. Lessing, I want to tell you that the man 

who was with you that morning, who stood guard with you then, was here -- is here to 

talk with you.ﬂ And I became ice cold, and I t hought, I j ust visi ted hi s grave, and the dead 
don™t rise from the grave, and -- and he is so fucked up here, you know with thi s, I™m 
sorry, excuse m y language, but I di dn™t know what to think. And a li ght went on on the 

far end of the stage, and this man walks out, t all man, who I™d seen in the photographs, 

who was described to me as the man who lived in Indonesia. And out walks this man, 

Herman Mueninghof. And he wal ks over to me, and he grabs m y hand, and he said, 

ﬁEddie, I™m so glad you™re alive.ﬂ And I sai d, ﬁHerman, it™s wonderful.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat 

are you doing here?ﬂ He said, ﬁThe TV people brought me here.ﬂ I said, ﬁAll the wa y

from Indonesia?ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat do you do there?ﬂ He said, ﬁI™m a Cat holic bishop, and I 
live in New Guinea.ﬂ I said, ﬁBut why are you here?ﬂ He said, ﬁThe y wanted me t o meet 

you.ﬂ I said, ﬁThat™s wonderful,ﬂ I said. He said, ﬁYou don™t seem to remember that -- 

how we st ood guard together that morning. You don™t -- don™t you remember how we -- 

how your mother saved our lives? How your mother, that night, gave me her bicycle, and 

the flashlight?ﬂ And all  of a sudden I realized I was wrong. It -- It wasn™t the other man, 
it was this man, this bishop, this Catholic bishop, Herman Mueni nghof. And again the 
picture changed. The -- Again we 
--
 the two of -- two of us had survived, and the others 
had survived also, the only one who had not survived was this poor Jan Carman, who had 

been in the hut, who I had remembered vaguely. And we talked, and we cried, and this 

just -- I sai d -- he said t o me, ﬁYour mother saved -- saved our lives.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, I 

know.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, you don™t.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat do you mean I don™t?ﬂ He said, ﬁDo you 

remember how your mother gave me her bi ke, and a little flashlight?ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, I do 
remember. You went out, you -- you pedaled awa y in -- in the darkness.ﬂ He sai d, ﬁI 
hadn™tgone moret han two minut esawa y whenaGerman sprang out inthe middleof 
-- 
of the road -- the path, and said, halt, get off the bike, stand against the wall.ﬂ There was a 

little pumphouse t here. He said, ﬁAnd I stood against the wall, wit h my face to the wall, 

and he frisked me from top to bot tom, to feel i f I had any weapons. If your mother hadn™t 

told us to bury the weapons that we had, our 
--
 our nine millimeter Mausers,ﬂ he said, 
ﬁthe y would have shot me, probably, on -- on the spot.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhat  happened t hen?ﬂ

He said, ﬁI don™t know where I got the guts, but I said, what are you doing? Why are you 
stopping me like this?ﬂ And the German said, ﬁI know you™re one of these -- these 

terrorists from the hut.ﬂ And Herman said, ﬁWhat hut? I don™t know any hut. What are 

you talking about?ﬂ And he said, ﬁYes, don™t deny it, you™re one of the terrorists from the 

hut. We have orders to arrest you al l, and we™l l get you.ﬂ He said, ﬁI have no idea what 

y,ﬂ 
-- he said, ﬁI come from night school.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou come from night school, what? 
Where night school?ﬂ He says, ﬁI come from night school in Zei st, and,ﬂ -- he said, 

ﬁWhat are you studyi ng there?ﬂ He said, ﬁI™m studying to be a Notary Public,ﬂ which was 

true, Herman was st udyi ng to be a Notary Public. And he said -- and he said, ﬁI felt that 

the guy, what he really wanted, was the little flashlight.ﬂ Now thi s wasn™t an ordi nary 

flashlight, it was something that was wort h gold in the last -- in -- during the war. It was 

made by Philips. It was a little hand generator, you squeezed it, and it made light . And i n 

a time that there were absolutely no batteri es any more, these things were worth gold. 
People would buy -- pay hundreds of gilders t o get o
ne. Andthe guy wantedthis, you 
know, it was worth somet hing to him. And Herman was very smart, he sa ys, ﬁI thought 

that if he arrested me, he would have to hand everything over to his superior officer, but 

if he let me go, he coul d keep the flashlight. So he -- I sai d to hi m, gi ve me the bike, the 

bike is no good to you, it™s solid t ires.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhat I -- M-My mother is waiti ng with 

dinner, you know.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI could see t he guy thinking, and then he said, ﬁNah, 

alza gazie, go.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI got  on the bike, and I pedal ed awa y. And if it hadn™t been

for your mother tell ing us to drop the weapons and bury them,ﬂ he says, ﬁI wouldn™t be 
here.ﬂ Anot her surprise. There was no end t o t he -- to the surprises.  

Q: Let me ask you some general questions, because it™s interesting how you tal k about 

the picture changing, and even over the last 10 years, all t his information that you™ve now 

learned from, you know, about ha -- what happened 50 years ago, can you just talk just 

generally about what it ™s been like for the l ast decade, to revisit the hi story, and have it 
all change, you know, fill in all those holes.  
A: Wh
-What about it? 

Q: Just what that experience is like, to -- to now, all this ti me later, be learning the history 

of what you went t hrough? 

A: It™s a little bit like being hungry, and never really having enough t o eat. It™s a weird 

thing to sa y, I guess. I am daily st ill trying to find out what happened, not exactly to me, 

but what happened to 
--
 to the Dutch Jews. I read articles, I -- m y cousin send 
--
 the same 
cousin wit h her little blue Honda, sends me, al most weekly, articles from the Dut ch 

newspapers describing the things that had happened in Holland. The mone y that™s 

missing, t he painti ngs that were stolen. The -- The archive of -- of -- o
f 
-- of name cards 

that was found recently, abandoned by the Dut ch government, somewhere in -- 
in it 
-- on 
the third floor. All these things sti ll are filling out m y picture of what happened in 

Holland, to the Dutch Jews. Every new book t hat comes out, I immediately buy, and they 

send me from Holl and, in Dutch, or whatever. That story seems to never be completely 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
88
 
 
 
 
complete. There™s always new -- seem to be new little things coming out. Because it™s 
impossible to remember two and a half years, every minut e of  it. So, I found out some of 

the things, and -- and -- but there™s still the desire to find out exactly where was I, what 

did I think, what happened? It™s an ongoing thing, it will  go on til the end of my l ife now, 

because the 
--
 the -- t he clarific -- it -- it™s li ke -- it™s like troubled wat er that slowly 
becomes clarified, more and more and more and more, who we were then, what we were, 
what we did, why did I do this, why did I? So, that™s the best that I can tell you, it -- it is a 
need to find out, st ill. And it all started in that God damn moment there, on that seventh 

floor of that hotel. It all started there. It™s very strange. It was time to go home. I got on 

the plane, very, very tired, because so much has been reveal ed to me now again. And I 

got back to JFK, t o the JFK airport in New York, and Carla was waiting for me t here. 

And she said, ﬁWel l, how did it go?ﬂ I said, ﬁI got to tell you something. It™s very strange, 

but for a Jewish boy like me, has now ha -- I have a friend who is a Catholic bishop in 
New Guinea, in Indonesia.ﬂ I subsequently asked Herman t o send me the complet e diary, 
and when I got it there were pages missing. And I send hi m a lett er, and I said -- I call 

hi m Herman, I don™t -- don™t call hi m Your Holiness, or Your Worship, or whatever. Or 

bishop. And I said, ﬁHerman, where are the pa -- missing pages, again?ﬂ He said, ﬁThere 

were things in there that were not so nice.ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t care. I want  -- would like to 

know.ﬂ And he send me the pages. There were remarks made by t he members of the 

Resistance i n the hut, about Jews not being rel iable enough, you coul dn™t trust them wit h

your life. I mean, this is -- this is ironic. The y had this 17 year ol d Jewish kid, he was not 
in the Resi stance, he was just in hiding. They didn™t really want hi m in the hut, but 

Oskam, who was very i nfluence -- influential i n that area for the Resi stance, and he was 

pivotal for them, had asked them to take i n thi s Jewish kid, and so they had to take hi m 

in. But it wasn™t -- there were several members who said, ﬁWell, we ca -- we can™t  really 

trust hi m, you know?ﬂ What is so superiorally ironic is t hat I later on saved the God damn 
lives of these men. I mean, it™s interesting how things evolve. Let me see. You don™t want 
to go forever with t his -- with this -- are you running out  of tape? 

Q: This -- This tape is about to end [indecipherable]

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is the cont inuation of an interview with Ed -- with Ed Lessing, and this is tape 
four, side A. And we were just goi ng to tal k in general, sort of, thinking about how 

you™re a different person than you might have been without the experi ences you went 

through during the war. Let™s first start in t erms of religion, cause you had menti oned 

during -- during the war that you had made that promise t o continue -- you made a 
promise to God to cont inue with religion, I wonder if you™d talk about that, a-
and how 
that didn™t work out. 

A: The y sa y that in the -- in the first World War, I guess, that in the trenches, every -- 

every soldier becomes religious, and prays. And in a sense that™s, I guess, what happened 

to me. And m y mother would have certainly approved of it when I s 
--
 when I said that -- 
I promised God that I would try t o keep his -- the laws he had gi ven t o Moses on Mount 

Sinai, and in the desert, that I would follow them all my life, if he would just spare m y 
family. And they survi ved. And I held on for years afterward, in this country, I would -- I 
had m y own kind of Jewish religi on. On Yom Kippur, I would take a prayer book -- no, I 

wouldn™t --  not -- not a pra yer book, I woul d take the Old Testament, and I woul d go out 

to the Hudson river, and I™d sit there all da y long, and I™d fast, and I read. I read about the 

Jews, and t heir hist ory, and the bat tles, and King David, and King Solomon, and all the 

wonderful stories of the Old Testament, and of my people. But at  -- again, as I began to 

find out what the Holocaust really had -- 
had been,
 it all seemed -- religion seemed like a 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
91
 
 
 
 
farce. God had taken hi s own people, and murdered one and a half -- let the Germans 
murder one and a half mil lion of his own chil dren, little children, innocents. It di dn™t 

make any sense. Li ke so many other Holocaust survivors, I guess, there was no t hinking 

of God after Auschwitz. And so I slowly, slowly left it all. I became 
--
 I read more, and 
more, and more, and none -- none of it pointed to the exi stence of -- of God. It all point ed 

out to the --  to the t errible things that human beings can do. So, religi on became not 
important any more to me. What did become more and more i mportant, though, is the 
fate of the Jewish people. I am very fervent in m y defense of the j -- of the Jewish people, 

asa most marvelous, m
arvelous people. Difficult people. Moses knew that already, goes 

up for a couple of da ys on the mountains, come back, and t he y already screwed it  up, 

they made a golden cal f. There™s a lesson t here. I mean, the J-Jews are difficult, and they 

are impossi ble, but they™re also genius, they are the salt of the earth. And to me, the 

Jewish people in Israel, they™re -- our country, I mean, this is all miraculous, after 2,000 
years. Jews have waited for this, and we™ve got a country. And I thank God. We have 
worked -- We have gone there for five years at least, and given our lives to it. It was well  

worth it. So, religion is sort of evolved into a fervent nationalism, and -- and a defense of 

the Jewish people. I wi ll accept no blame whatsoever to Israel, what t hey do, or whatever 

they do. It™s -- I™m like the old fashioned English -- 
Englishman, you know?My country 
-

- Or maybe it was an American, I don™t know. I think it was an Englishman who said, my 

country right or wrong. To me, the -- the securit y of the Jewish people is uppermost, and 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
92
 
 
 
 
it sounds horrendous, but if it would be necessary to throw every Arab out of -- out of 
Israel in order to secure it™s -- it™s 
--
 the safety of it™s people, I™d sa y, don™t hesitate, do it . 
We have suffered for 2,000 years, murder and ma yhem. I mean hangings, burni ngs, it™s 

horrible, the whole Jewish history is -- is one of -- of -- of  suffering. Enough. Now it™s 

our ti me. And so, I guess, my reli gion became really m y love for -- for my people. And 

it™s difficult someti mes you know? I -- We had to -- Carla has two grand -- had a 
grandnephew here, very nice young man who worked for the Israel i embassy here, and he 
came with his girlfriend, and the y sta yed here for three months upstai rs in a little room. 

And we had this -- we had this conversati on, and the y sai d, ﬁOh, we don™t -- we don™t 

give a damn for politics in Israel, i t™s horri ble. We don™t want to know anything about 

politics, and we don™t want to -- and I think we should gi ve the land back to the 
--
 to the -
- to the Palestinians, or whoever, and th-the S yrians, and -- and we don™t want to be 

involved i n this.ﬂ And I -- These were the people I admire, these are t he sabbers, the 
people who are born there, and I said, ﬁLet me tell you something. Let me give you at 
least a view of a Holocaust survivor. We had no country, we had nowhere to go. There 

was no way out, the y murdered us by the mil lions.ﬂ I sai d, ﬁThe Jewish people suffered 

unbelievably, [indecipherable]. Now there™s a country, and you are our hope.ﬂ I said, 

ﬁThe first thing for us as -- as survivors, i s a security, a safe haven, where Jews can go, 

where Jews can be defended. So don™t say that you™re not interested, please.ﬂ And the y 

understood. So, I don™t know if that™s an answer for your question, but that™s as cl ose as 
I

can come. Religion is no longer of an -- any i mportance t o me at t his point, but the fate of 
m y people is,very muchso. 
 

Q: Let me ask you about the -- the interviews that your brother Fred did with -- with the 

family. First of all, when did -- when did t hat happen, did t hat start  to begin this process 

of being interested i n [indecipherabl e] this 
--
 

A: With my brother?It 
-- Can you hold on a second? I™ll get the book -- 
Q: Sure.  

A: -- and show you the dates, and -- 

Q:Oh,so tell me what thisis?
 
A: This is a box, which is about -- as you can see, about 12 to 15 i nches long, and it hol ds 

audio tapes that m y brother did wit h the whole family. Underdark means diving under, 

going into hiding. The family™s recollection of the Holocaust years, and there are one, 

two, three, four, five, six, seven, ei ght, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 tapes, and everybody that I 
know is li ke -- Carla, m y wife, and Hans, my cousin, Carla -- Fred, m y brother. Aba is 
m y brother Art, who changed his name to Aba at some point. Me, Ed, Le
ne, m y mother. 

Lene and Art is m y father and -- m y mother and father, and m y father. And -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Transcri ption. No, it  doesn™t gi ve -- has a wonderful preface, by t he wa y, and t he first 

interview,I think was probably1979.
 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
94
 
 
 
 
Q: So, these interviews began long before your process of realizing that this was 
important t o go back, and -- 

A: Well, not so -- not so long, a couple of years before, yes. We had 
--
 The first 
interview, with m y motherisreally 
-- I would love to writ e a pla y around it, a one act 

play, ma ybe. It is an interview that i s at the same ti me serious, I™ve quoted some of it to 

you, and it™s also hilari ous, because everybody is sitting around a round table, and it™s not 
just the -- it started out as a regular interview with m y mother, but it finall y -- everybody 
threw in their two cents worth, there are interruptions, and -- and -- and my father sa ys I -
- should I bring the dog to the vet t omorrow? And it™s like -- it™s a wonderful interview, I 
would love to see it on stage, as a beginning of m y mother™s story. So, the other dates, I -- 

I -- I don™t know if you want to know them all, but [indecipherable] has -- he transcribed 

this, by the way, with his son Ben, who doesn™t know any Dutch, and half of  my 

mother™s story is i n Dutch. [indecipherable] I™ll just give you another date. Oh, this is 
even earlier, 1985. He interviewed m y father at 1985. And he interviewed me, I™ll do the 
last one, oka y? He interviewed me in 1983, and m y -- m y other brother even later, I 

think. Did I answer your question, or did I digress again? 

Q: [indecipherable] Another question I would ask, from t he -- your interview, you talked 

a lot about going back t o therapy, and sort of looking back at that ti me, and I wanted to 

sort of ask, not a specific question, but how that process has sort of changed your other 

views, too?  

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
95
 
 
 
 
A: The therapy? Oh, night and da y. About 25 years ago, I had ulcer symptoms, and I 
wentto m y mem 
--  
m y 
-- m y house doctor, and -- that™s a typical Dutch translation, isn™t  
it, my house doctor? I don™t know what t he y call it [indecipherable]  

Q: Family doctor? 

A: Yeah, family doctor. In Holland the y sa y your house doctor. Every once in awhile I 

catch m yself with t hese Dutch translations. And he said, ﬁWell, you know you --  you 
have to get an -- undergo a G.I. series, you -- you have li ke ulcer symptoms, you ma y 
have an ulcer. Anywa y, it came out I didn™t have an ulcer yet, but I was very close, and 

he said -- he recommended that I go to a cli nic in a hospit al nearby, where it -- for very 

cheap
, and you could get therapy, you know, but -- and it was -- c-could be seen by a -- 
so I contacted a -- a doctor there, and he said 
--
 and when he found out that I was a 
Holocaust survivor 
-- t hat was just sort of be 
--
 people began to be aware that there was 
something special with people who have come through that, and 
--
 and I started going 
every 
-- once a week t o this -- to this clinic. Unfortunatel y, after awhi le, that doctor 

couldn™t see me any m ore, but he recommended me to another doctor, Doctor Hillel 

Swiller, and I went to him for about -- one of the first sessions I had with hi m, I said, 

ﬁLook, I want to tel l you something doctor,ﬂ I said, ﬁI am not one of these guys who 

believes in going for years and years and years into psychotherapy. I see it more or less, 

exactly the wa y, if I break a leg, I go to a doct or, and he puts a cast around it, and then 

like a month later, or you know, whenever, two months later, the cast  comes off, and 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
96
 
 
 
 
that™s the end of it, you know?ﬂ Well, that was 23 years ago, and -- and I don™t go now 
any more, I -- but he totally changed me, because I was a very angry person. I can still get 

very angry, but at least I -- I cal m down agai n. I was very depressed, skies were gra y all 

the ti me, and I was very angry. I was not a very good father, I™m afrai d, with my children, 

I got very angry someti mes, I would throw thi ngs against  walls, and ooh, when I think 

back of it, it™s al most unbelievable that I was like that, but I -- I was. Had no insight in 
m yself. That is all changed, you know, you begin to -- ma ybe just age, but also, again, 
finding out about what happened to us then, has clarified my own personality a lot, you 

know? I can see m yself now as -- as that -- 
the littleboy, who 
-- how he grew up, and 
how he -- the 1929 episode in -- in the Uni ted States was a terrible one. My mot her had t o 

farm me out. She farmed me out t o a young woman who -- I don™t know if she beat me, 

but she was very bad for me. I remember crying, and doing -- 
andfinally m y mother 

found out, and she took me away from there, and farmed me out t o ol d people, grandma, 
grandpa the y were call ed, and they were lovel y for me. B ut that first -- first experience, 
being separated from my mother, who had to go to work because my father was in the 

hospital then, and being alone, and being mistreated, when the war came, and the whole 

thing started all over again, the loneliness, and the danger and the fear, I think it all 

accumulated. And then we had, what, 25 years of doing nothing, and then you wind up 

with a psychiatrist. It™s -- You know, it™s funny. One of the last sessions -- recent ly I had 

to go back t o hi m for just the one session, because I have interviewed a man nearby here, 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
97
 
 
 
 
who had been in Auschwitz with his brother, and the story was so terrible that I had 
nigh
t mares overnight, wh
-what happened to him, happened to me during the night, and 

the next morning I was craz y, I -- I couldn™t cl ear m y head, and I -- m y wife said, 

ﬁYou™ve got to go see 
--
 see a shrink because, you know, this has been too much of a 
thing.ﬂ And I went back to hi m, and we tal -- and he helped me imm ediately, and we 

talked about it, and he 
--
 he explained to me why it upset me so much, because it was -- 
this man had been with his brother in Auschwi tz, and it brought al l my war stories back, 

the danger, and the fear with m y l ittle brothers, and -- and I said, ﬁYou know, I never 

talked about the Holocaust with you, did I?ﬂ And he began to laugh, he said, ﬁYou did 

nothing else.ﬂ He sa ys, ﬁYou did -- you di d all the ti me,ﬂ he said. I sai d, ﬁI can™t 
remember that, did I talk about? I thought I onl y talked about sex, and -- and -- and 

women, and,ﬂ -- he sai d, ﬁYou craz y.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou,ﬂ -- no, he didn™t sa y I was crazy. 

He said, ﬁEd,ﬂ he said, ﬁevery sessi on you talked about the Holocaust.ﬂ ﬁOh, I did? All 
right.ﬂ So, I don™t know where we started with this question, I l ost myself in the answer, 
but -- oh, did th -- did t herapy change me, how did it change me? It made me into a more 

wise person, I think. More livable person. I don™t think our marriage would have lasted if 

I hadn™t, was pretty i mpossible, you know? Carla is very even person, is like -- the whole 

family, her mother was like that, her brother is like that, t he y™re wonderful people. The y -

- The y™re not -- don™t have great emotional outbursts on t he up side, but also not on the 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051
 
 
98
 
 
 
 
down side. The y™re very, very stable, and I was very unstable. So, I am more stable now, 
let™s put it that wa y. 

Q: In -- In terms of what™s made you and Carl a so involved now, recently, the last 10 

years, where ma ybe ot her people, other survi vors, the y™ve withdrawn more, what™s made 

you do -- choose that path, and also how i s it 
--
 how has t hat changed you? 
A: You know, I -- I™ve thought about it, and I™ve come up with an answer that ma y not be 
the right one, but when you deal with Hol ocaust survivors, as you do now, and as I have 
done in int erviews, you realize there™s an enormous range of suffering. Those people -- 

and I™ve interviewed people who were lying i n a hole in the ground in the woods for nine 

months, frozen practically to death. That is not  comparable to what  I 
--
 what happened to 
me. The y saw th -- I™ve interviewed people where, first their fa -- their mother, then their 

father was killed, then the brothers, a -- a woman had seven brothers, she wound up with 

one after the war. One by one they were killed in Polish forests where they were i n 
hiding. One by one, she saw them being slaughtered. That woman is probably -- it is 
probably i mpossible for her to go out and do interviews --  interview other Holocaust 

survivors. I come from a family that survived complete. An oddity in Holland, by the 

way. Holland has a -- 
has a 
-- I don™t know if you™re familiar with the statistics of 

Holland. Holland i s the worst country after Pol and and Greece, and certainly by far the -- 

the worst country for survivors in -- in the -- i n -- west of Europe, western Europe. So, 

m y k  
-- m y family survived. I came out with a father, I came out with a mother, I came 

 
 
U S H MM A rch i v es  R G
- 50.549.02*0051

out with t wo brot hers. I came out with cousins, I came with uncles, aunts, a whole family. 
I think that because of that, it is possible for me to go and interview other people, and not 

go completely to pi eces. I think if I had been l ike the woman who saw her family 

slaughtered one by one in the Polish forest, I don™t think I could be like -- sitting here, 

talking wit h you li ke this. So -- Then there is something else, this is usually not talked 

about. There is an intel lectual range in Hol ocaust survivors, as well as non-Hol ocaust 
survivors, course. It makes a big difference what -- where you come from, intellectually. 
If you come from a Pol ish farming family, a Jewish family, somewhere in a shtet l, where 

the father was a shoemaker, and the mother di d the household, and -- and life was fairly 

primitive, but wonderful, but then, that™s not my background eit her. I come from a 

family, m y father was an artist. My mother was a telegraph operat or when she -- when --  

when no women were practically working. I come from a family that  loved music, loved 

literature, loved all t he kinds of things. I come from a family where I have one -- two 
brothers who were coll ege professors, one -- one has changed in t he meanti me, t o be an 
--
 
a psych -- a psychot herapist. You know, this makes a big difference. I-It™s possible for -- 
for Carla and me, come from a little different group, little different level, to help others. 

When  
-- When we go t o national conferences, and I see the others, they™re not that many 

that -- I cried when I saw them the first ti me, t he 1600 hidden chi ldren, and I still feel, 

you know, love for them, but -- but I realize now that not  all Hol ocaust survivors are 

people that 
--
 that I can -- that I can feel at home with, you know? And it™s interesting i n

many of the interviews that I™ve done, the i nterviewee said, ﬁEd, we got to get together 
afterwards, you know. Let™s go out, you and m y -- m y wife, and -- a-a-and I, and you and 
your wife, and we™re going to have dinner together.ﬂ And I thought, ﬁI can™t do t his, not  

with you.ﬂ I mean, very pri mitivepeople someti mes. Lovelypeople, butp
rimitive, I 

couldn™t -- you know, I couldn™t. There was nothing we had in common, except t hat I 

interviewed them. So 
--  Let™s see, what was the qu -- what  was the question? Oh, why do 
we -- why can we do this, and others cannot? I think it had to do with our background, 

the fact that we™re not t oo damaged, and the fact that we came from backgrounds where 

reading, and -- and -- and culture was of -- of importance. And you™ll find this all over, if 

you look at the people who, let™s say, are important in -- 
in
 the Holocaust community, 
they™re most 
-- mostly people who were not that terribly damaged, and who -- who can 
write, and read, and understand, and so -- or a psychologi st, or whatever. I don™t kn -- I -- 

I think -- that is m y view of it.  
Q: Is there anything else that you want to 
--
 
A: Yeah. I forgot something. And I think he deserves a place, and I don™t think he is in 

the original interview, because he couldn™t be. After the conference, i n 1981, of the 

Hidden Children, a lett er arrived at my -- 
m y wife™
s desk in New York, of the Hidden 
Children, from a man in Yonkers, his name was Eddie St rauss, have you heard of him? 

No. Eddie Strauss wrote a letter, and it said, ﬁI™m so sorry, I™m a hidden child from 

Belgium, and I™m so terribly sorry I couldn™t come to the conference, because I was in the

hospital, but I would li ke to take up contact  with you.ﬂ And Carl a came home with this 
letter, and she handed it to me, and said, ﬁListen, I™m very busy, and this man writes, and 

he lives right nearby here, about 10 minutes away, in Yonkers. Ma ybe you can contact 

hi m.ﬂ Oka y. So one day I call -- called up t his man, and I got hi m on the phone, and I -- 

and I said, ﬁAh, Mr. Strauss?ﬂ ﬁYes?ﬂ I said, ﬁMy wife handed me thi s letter, could I 

comeandsa y hello to you?ﬂYou k
now. ﬁYeah, I heard you -- you were sorry you 
couldn™t come to the conference.ﬂ ﬁYes,ﬂ he said. So I went down, straight down 
Broadway, same Broadway you have in New York, and entered a dark apart ment, 

climbed five stairs, five steps up from street level, and entered a dark apart ment, and 

there in the far -- far end of the dark apartment  sat a man i n a wheelchair, with one leg. I 

hadn™t expected this. He was overweight, and I shook hi s hand, and I said, ﬁSo, t ell me 

about yourself.ﬂ And out comes this story that he was -- he lived in Antwerp, in Belgium, 
and he was play -- out playing one da y, and he sta yed out  too late, and when he came 
back, a neighbor grabbed hi m from the street, and said, ﬁYou can™t  go home.ﬂ And he 
found out later that his mother, his grandmother, his three year old si ster, and his one year 

old baby brother had been snatched awa y from t he house that day by -- by the Germans, 

put in a truck. The y were sent to Auschwitz, and the da y t hat the y arrived, the y were all 

gassed, all murdered. That was Eddie™s background, and his family. He wound up in an 

orphan home in -- Belgium had six or seven orphan homes that were set up by the -- 
by 

the Judenrat, and with help of the Belgian Queen Mother, and the Germans knew about it.

So these children were really, I sa y, hostages of the Germans. But they were cared for, 
and taken care of, and Eddie had been one of them. He had, after the war, he had come to 

theUnited States. He 
--  He went to an uncle of his in Manhattan, and -- and his 
grandfather lived there, and it didn™t work out. The y were German Jews, and they 

couldn™t understand this boy who had, at one t ime, been found in the street, totally full of 

lice, and -- and full of wounds, and -- so Eddie was placed somewhere in New Jerse y, 
with people who were very good for hi m, and he went to 
--
 he went to college, and he 
graduated, very smart. Joined the American arm y -- was drafted into the American arm y, 
and of all places was sent to Germany, because he knew fluent German, and he knew 

French fluently, and English. And he worked for the adjutant general, or somethi ng like 

that, in -- in -- in -- 
in Munchen, orso
-someplace, interviewing Germans to see if they 
were Nazis, and so on. He came back, and he i nvented a story about himself, he made an 

artificial life. The people didn™t know that he was Jewish. He st -- He said that when 
people asked about his parents, he said the y had died in a car accident in Texas, and he 
had had -- he had a sist er somewhere, but al so in Texas, and he hadn™t seen her in years, 

and so on. He told me all this. His name was Eddie, like mine. Our birthdates happened 

to be the same, the eighth of May. And somehow another, I decided t hat I would adopt 

this man. And I began to do what i n Jewish we call mitzvahs, good deeds. I got him -- 

first of all, I got hi m money. I helped hi m wit h everything he needed, as much as I could, 

and he became like a brother to me, and I was his brother, you know, I™m the brother that

had died. And I took care of him as much as I could, for years. He went -- He had only 
one leg, he had diabetes, and about a year after I met hi m, his ot her leg had to be 

amputated, so now he had no legs at all, and he wanted to commit suicide, he had tried 

once to commit sui cide. Ha -- But he got a new apart ment , a nice, cl ean apart ment, and 

he had electric wheelchair, which made hi m very happy. And I gi -- brought him gifts, 

and I brought hi m books, and I talked with him, and -- and I took him to Hidden Child 
meetings in New York, on Puri m, or you know. And he was here, we sat in this room 
with hi m for Passover, to the seder, we invited hi m, and brought hi m with. Lot of troubl e, 

always, gett ing hi m with the wheelchair to there -- places. And we t ook hi m to 

Washington, I took hi m to Washington when the Hidden Children, our group 
from 

Westchester, went t o the Holocaust  museum, he wanted to go there, and you can™t 

imagine what we went through, took Eddie in the wheelchair to -- t o Washington. And 

February, 1997, he died in front of the computer I had got ten him. He wanted to learn the 
computer, and he learned, and then he was suddenly dead, and he was gone. And it fell to 
me to take care of his stuff, little stuff that he had. And it  fell to me, about a year ago, to 

put a -- to take care of his funeral, and then lat er to put a stone on -- on his grave. And I 

decided that there was more to hi m than j ust 
--
 more to his grave, and there should be 
more to that grave, and I had a gra 
--
 on the gravestone, I had a stonemason chisel that -- 
something like,in this place 
-- let t his place remember not  only Eddie Strauss, whose 
name was really Abraham Katz, but also his mother, with her name, and his father, and

his sister Esther, and hi s little one year old brother. I put all their names on there, with the 
dates, all ki lled in Auschwitz. So that gravestone is nearby here, and I™m very proud of 

that, that at least that™s the last thing I coul d do for Eddie. And I wanted to put that in, i t 

was also a part of my development after the war, as a -- an aware Jew, let me put  it that 

way.
