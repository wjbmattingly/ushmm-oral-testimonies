, conducted by 
Ina Navazelskis
 on March 1
st
, 2010, at 
Leisure 
World
 in
 Silver Spring, Maryland
. Mr.
 Fagiolo
, can you tell us a little bit about 
your back ground; where you were born; wh er
e you grew up; your family, and so on 
and so fo rth? 
Answer: Yeah, I was born in 
Washington, D.C.
, and I made a historic beginning. I 
was born the night th at the 
Knickerbocker
 Theater in 
Washington
 collapsed. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Yeah, that Œ they Œ the roof collapsed on the 28
th
, and I was born on th e 29
th
. 
Q: On th e 29
th
 of wh ich month and Œ 
A: Of January, 1922. 

Q: And you grew up in 
Washington? 
A: I grew up in 
Wa shington
, I went to all school in here. I went to 
Central
 High 
School and graduated.
 And then  I was Œ I graduated 
from high school in June of 
™41. So  you know what I was 
doing on December of ™42 Œ 
Q: I can imagine. 
A: k Œ or ™41. So  I had no 
education other than a high 
school education, and I was 
drafted in February of Œ 
of 1943, and I took my  basic training at the infas Œ 
infamous 
Fort Hood
, or at that time was known as 
Camp Hood. 
And the camp  had

just opened, as a matter of fact, we sl
ept in the motor pool
, because the barracks 
weren™t ready fo r us. 
Q: Can you tell us where was this camp? 
A: Camp in 
Texas
, in 
Killeen, Texas. 
And I Œ I stayed there fo
r about a year. I took 
my  basic training th ere, and I was sent to a s-school. Wh en I grad uated from the 
school, they kept me there as an instruct
or, and I stayed maybe six or seven months. 
Q: How is it that you came into the army ra
ther than one of the other branches of 
military service? 

A: Well, that™s my own fault, I wanted to
 go into the Air Force,
 and I took the Air 
Force exam, passed it. But I was drafted be
fore the Air Force could get to me. And 
the rule in that day is, once you™re 
drafted, you can™t choose your service. 
Q: I see. 

A: Your service has to be picked  prior to your induction. 

Q: Are you the only son in your family? 
A: Yes, I Œ 
Q: Were there any girls?  

A: Yes, I had one sister, who is now deceased. 
Q: And your parents, when yo
u were drafted, how did they
 respond to it? Were they 
upset, were they Œ

A: No, they weren™t, they Œ I Œ I think in 
those days I Œ I Œ we looked at it as an 
honor to go into the Œ into
 the army . And if you were
 rejected, or become a 
4F
, it 
was really Œ I™ve seen men cry be
cause they were 
turned down.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: But my parents were from 
Ital y
. They were born over 
there. They met while 
they were in the 
United States. 
And th e oddity is that 
two sisters ma rried two 
brothers. And th ey were Œ well, you know, 
we just lived here, and my father took 
me down to
 Georgetown  
and put me on the bus, and as 
he was walking away , I saw 
him cry, I had Œ I™d Œ I™d never Œ never sa
w Œ never saw my  fath
er cry too often. 
But I guess he was happy. But they  were 
always good to me, I had a good family. 
And so I went to
 Fort Hood.
 And after I taught there for 
awhile, I tried to get out of 
teaching. I Œ I wanted to get into a 
Œ a lion outfit, which was a Œ not Œ not 
necessarily a fighting outfit, but do some
thing other than  just teach my whole 
career. So I put in for what they called
 ASTP. 
Q: What does that stan d for? 

A: I-It stan d for Army Specialized Training Corp. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And the purpose of that 
was, you would go to some 
university, get a degree from 
college, and upon gradua
tion you were obligated to serv
e two years as an officer in

the army. So I went to 
Texas A&M
, and I was there about maybe four months, and 
they disb anded Œ 
Q: The program? 
A: Œ the program. So th ey sent
 me back, at that time was 
Camp Hood,
 and during 
the interim, the camp had changed from 
a Œ a tank destroyer, to the infantry. 
Q: Why was it called an infamous camp? 
A: Well, ni Œ because of the recent Œ the recent episode Œ 
Q: Ah, that. 
A: Yeah, that. 

Q: Okay, because of that, okay, yeah. 
A: But it Œ it Œ it™s one of 
the largest camps in the 
U.S. Army
. I think from one end 
of the spectrum to the other is 
like 26 miles. That™s why it™s a Œ 
Q: Okay . So  you™re talking about a shooting 
th at took place in 2009, but you were 
there half a century Œ 

A: Before. 
Q: Œ before. Yeah, okay. 

A: So an yway, I ended up in  the infantry, and I did one Œ I Œ I was a 
[indecipherable]
 for one cycle, training so ldiers. 
And then I got orders to go to

Camp Gruber, Oklahoma
, which was the 42
nd
 infantry division. And I was in that 
camp, I think Ju ly or in Au gust, and we
 mo ved out in Œ in November, probably Œ 
Q: How large was the division? 
A: It was Œ well, one infantry division 
usually consists of about 30,000 men. 
Q: That™s a lot. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And Œ and you 
moved out in Œ 
A: Well, then Œ then Œ then
 we were shipped overseas. 
Q: In what time? 

A: It was in November of ™44. 
Q: So, already after 
D-Day
. 
A: Oh yeah. 
D-Day
 had passed. 
Q: And so where Œ where was your firs
t European  landing 
with the division? 
A: In
 Marseilles.  
Q: In
 Marseilles
, okay
. 
A: And from there we went up and we caug
ht the lines. And the 
reason they  closed 
the
 ASTP 
is that they had lost more men on 
D-Day
 than Œ than we™ve advertised or 
reported. So  they were short of infantry
 people. And when  we
 went over, we were 
only the three infantry divisions. Artillery
, the medics an d everything else didn™t

come over until January. So wh en we got there, they to
ld us we were going to a 
quiet sector, the whole alliance. Well, the qui
et sector turned out 
to be the Battle of 
the Bulge. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: At 
Ba sto gne
. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: So we lo Œ we were green soldiers a
nd we probably  made a lot of mistakes, but 
we lost a lot of good men.  

Q: Can you tell me about wh at happened  
to you, wh at you reme mb er from that 
time, where you were?  
A: You mean from Œ 
Q: When you were in thes
e battles, when you were in
 the Œ you know, when you 
had landed  in 
Marseilles,
 your first me mo ries of what you saw. 
A: Saw is just going up thro ugh 
France
, wh ich we Œ by that 
time had already been 
secured. And the thing I rememb er is the 
civ ilians, they had so
o set Œ two sets of 
flags. They had a wh ite one and Œ and 
an American one. So it depend who was 

going by, which flag they woul
d wave out of the window. 
Q: Oh my. Oh my.

A: But we landed, it was very co
ld. We landed at what they call 
CP2, 
wh ich  was a 
Œ 
Q: Mm-hm, what does that mean? 
A: That was where they organized the Œ th
e soldiers at Œ at Œ once they co Œ you 
leave the boat. And that™s where we met Bed Check 
Charlie
, that was a German 
plane. They would co me over every night, 
and that was a nickname that we gave 
them. 

Q: Bad check 
Charlie
? 
A: Bal Œ Bed Ch eck 
Charlie. 
Q: Bed Check
 Charlie. 
A: Yeah. He made sure we got to bed. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Never fired on us, just flew over. So th at was it, and then th
ey Œ they rush ed us 
to the front, and that™s when we hit the Œ 
the Battle of the Bulge, the snow and the 
freezing weather, and Œ 

Q: You were in that? 

A: Yeah, I was in that. I went over as a 
corporal, and we lost so many men, that I 
became a staff sergeant overnight.

Q: Were you Œ a

 la Œ well, th Œ for you, how long did that 
battle last? 
A: That battle last until the end of January. 
Q: So for Œ for Œ 
A: For a month, five weeks. 

Q: For a month, five weeks. 

A: And my birthday is the 29
th
 of January, and that was th
e date that they took us 
off the front, and that was my  birthday presen t. 

Q: Pretty good birthday present. 

A: Yup. 
Q: I remember when I lived in 
The Netherlands
, there is a cemetery outside the 
town that I lived, maintain
ed by the American militar
y, and they had bring Œ 
brought in a lot of the soldiers who died 
in the Battle of the Bulge. Not only that 
battle, but a lot of others. 

A: Oh, th at 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: It was Œ and th-the hills are just cove
red, they™re just c
overed. And f Œ very 
moving, very moving to  walk around th ere. 

A: It is, it is, it is. The first person that I 
lost when we hit the front, was wit Œ was an 
old timer, and he was drafted when he wa
s 30, you know, and th at was the upper

[indecipherable]
. And we became good friends. He was in the insurance business, 
my father was also, so we had a little co
mmon interest in that. Before we went 
overseas, we used to go to the 
PX Œ 
Q: 
[sneeze] 
Excuse me, excuse me. I was 
going to stifle that one. 
A: Oh, that™s all right, that™s all right. So
 anyway, we became good friends, we™d go 
to the 
PX
 and so  forth. And the first night th
at we were in battle, I had a sleeping 
bag, it was down . And I got it on a raffle, cau
se they only gave 
one per platoon. So 
the first night we tried to bed down , I 
couldn™t find my  bedroll. An d it was common 
in the army to say it was a midnight requis
ition, that somebody had acquired it. So 
anyway, the next day Œ his name was
 Clifford
, he came over to me and he says, 
Romeo
, I™m sorry, I grabbed your bedroll by 
mistake. Cause he knew it was mine, 
cause it was the only one. 

Q: That was down. 

A: So I said, that™s okay, 
Cliff.
 But anyway, about three hour
s later, he was dead, so 
I always felt that he had hi
s last night on th is good earth, in my  nice sleeping bag. 

Q: At least warm, yeah. 

A: Yeah. So Œ 
Q: Do you Œ were y
ou there when  he Œ 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
12
A: No, he was on an other si Œ another gun 
post. We were in the anti-tank, and when 
we got there we were supposed to have 
three anti-tank guns, and three trucks. And 
we got no t Œ we had no trucks, and two guns. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: And then  we lost his gun, the Germans 
fired a direct hit. As a matter of fact, it 
was told to me later that Œ 
that an 88 shell hit him in
 the head. And when I went 
there after it was over, there was a fellow called 
Valentime
(ph), he had red hair, 
and there was red hair all over the guns an
d place. So anyway, that was his last 
night on earth, with my bedroll. 

Q: Was that the first time you ha
d seen such Œ you had seen Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Œ that sort of thing? 

A: That was the first b attle, the first. 
So after that, a-after January, after my 
birthday, we had lost so many men, they 
to ok us back  and we
 organized this, and 
refilled the ranks. 

Q: Where did they take you to? 

A: I-It was in 
France, 
close to 
Nancy, France, 
and we Œ we were there about three 
weeks before they got all 
the men back together. And 
so we stayed there until

13
March, the first of March, and then that™s 
when we tried Œ had the offensive, that we 
went thro ugh th e Œ 

Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that? 
A: Yeah, well, that was really Œ the resi
stance wa-wasn™t too heavy. But it was buth 
Œ y-you™d hit Œ certa
in times when you would hit 
little resistance and then you 
would go in reserve, and th en the next da
y you might move 20 miles with nothing, 
no resistance.  

Q: And was this alr
eady th rough southern 
Germa ny
, or was this still in
 France
? 
A: Th-Th Œ no, no, we had Œ still in 
France
, and we didn™t cross the 
Rhine
, and I 
remember it was Easter Sunday. 

Q: At wh at point did you cross the 
Rhine
, at what place? Do you remember? 
A: No, I don™t. 
Q: You don™t. But it was a Œ but probably in th e south. 

A: Oh yeah, it was south 
Germany
. And th en, and from that point on, it was just Œ 
we went thro ugh Œ we 
took v-various th Œ 
Daun,
 we took 
Schweinfurt
, we took Œ 
we Œ we took th  Œ three or four Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ cities. 
Q: Is it Œ did you come in contact with German 
POWs
? 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
14
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: As you were comi
ng along, yeah? As you were going there. 
A: Well Œ well, they were surrendering, and th
e story that I always tell, we were in 
reserve, and I Œ they  used to give us a 
chocolate bar to eat. And I was eating that, 
and I had a tap on my  sh oulder and I turn
ed around. And it wa
s a German soldier, 

and he had a white flag. 

Q: And he wanted some chocolate? 
A: Well, I guess maybe he did, bu t that he had a circular from 
Eisenhower
 
encouraging the Germans to surrender, and 
th at they would be well taken care of, 
and so fo rth. So , he was all alone, and 
I didn't know what to do with him. And 
luckily, there were other Germans coming fro
m the front, quite a few of them, so I 
just told him to fall 
in with the rest of 
them, and that was the last time I saw him. 
Q: Did he Œ was he
 young, or old? 
A: Ah, ah , n Œ he Œ he wasn
™t young, but he wasn™t ol
d. You Œ I Œ he mu st have 
been 30 or 40. I tell you, their faces were
 dirty, they were beard. Y-You know, it 
was really to distinguish  the age. And in
 those days, you know, e-every time we got 
a German prisoner, they always say, you know, 
nicht schiessen, 
you know, Polack, 
Polack, you know. Don™t shoot me, boy. 
Q: Don™t shoot me, I™m a Pole. 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
15
A: I™m a Pole. And that™s what they would do. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But Œ 
Q: Did you come in contact 
with the civilian population? 
A: Oh, a-as you go
 through the town. 
Q: That™s right. And was there a differe
nce between the Fren
ch and the German 
towns as you were going through them? 

A: Yes. First of all, you could tell the Œ 
being a German, the civilians were well 
clothed. The French had no
thing. Clothes, you could 
tell the difference, I don™t 
know about soap and things
 like that, but once you hit 
Germany
, there was a 
different class of people, and that they had 
a better part of the life. And some of the 
stories that the Frenchmen tell, it
™s a Œ you know, it™s disgraceful. 
Q: What did you hear? What were some of 
those stories that the Œ that the French 
were telling? 
A: Oh, well I got Œ I got it in here, the Œ a 
story that Œ actually, this was in Œ in 
France
, a lady that Œ they were in nor 
Œ
 
No rway, 
and it was a fishing to wn , and 
they were sending messages to Œ to 
Russia
, and 
Russia
 would send them to
 
England
, and the Germans caught them. And th
ere were seven of them. So they 
took the men out and they wa
nt them to dig their own graves. So one of them was 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
16
slow doing it, and wh en the 
officer, the German officer was pushing him along, he 
says, I™m in no hurry, I sh Œ he says, I 
know wh at I™m digging. So  the German got 
mad and spit on him. And this Œ and the fish
erman, with his spad
e, turned around 
and hit him with such 
force, that he actually decapitated him. 
Q: Oh! 
A: And of course, when he did that, that was the end of it, and the other Germans 

had killed the rest of them. And in retaliati
on, they took the wives, seven wives, and 
they took them to Œ to 
Germany
 and this one lady that sh
e had a eight months old 
baby girl, and when  she got on the boat, 
they took the baby 
from her, and the put it 
on a crib, in a box on the deck
 of the ship. And wh en she came out the next mo rning 
the baby was gone. And of course they a
ssumed that Œ that they just threw her 
overboard . And she ended up as a Œ wo rki
ng fine wires for the German in some 
factory. And when they were Œ when 
she was liberated Œ I wasn™t there, 

incidentally, this was told to me by, y
ou know, another comp any, that those wo men 
were all in cells. They would open the ce
lls, and th ey wouldn™t come out. And th ey 
would tell them, you know, you™re free, you™re 
free. But they were 
just scared. They  
didn™t know Œ i-i-i-it makes you cry, it real
ly does. The people were just scared, 
they lived  from day to day. 
They  never knew when  they 
were going to be the last 
day. They  finally coaxed them out, and th
en the Americans, which I take pride of, 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
17
the-they really treated thos
e people. They gave them 
their own food and clothes, 
and they were well tak en care of. And s-so it Œ after that Œ 
Q: So, as soldiers, you were swapping thes
e stories that you were seeing, you Œ th at 
you were experience Œ yeah. 

A: Yeah, well, you know, after 
[indeciphera ble]
 relates this one lady that they Œ 
that they had come across. And eventually
, see, we have a reunion ev ery year. And 
one year, they Œ they  brought her over. Sh e al
ways wanted to meet the Œ the sold iers 
that liberated her. And she came o v er w
ith her daughter. An
d Œ and she brought 
with her, she had a quilt Œ not a quilt, it was a 
Œ a blanket. And in Œ while in the cell, 
what she did, knitting, she kn
itted her family tree on the quilt. And she brought that 
with her, and it was old, and oh, but you 
could tell where she had spent hours just 

doing it. 

Q: Doing it, yeah. 

A: But the thing that amazed me
, they were scared to come
 out. They were scared to 
come out. 

Q: So do you remember the first time 
you had contact with German civilians? Was 
it me mo rable, or not really 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well Œ well, see, the only ones that you r
eally hit, is that you™re going along, and 
the people on the street, they were Œ cour
se, they had the Amer
ican, and you know, 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
18
you would wave, and maybe talk
 to them. One night I had an experience, I got lost 
with my  squad, and I didn™t know which wa
y to go, and there was a Œ a German. So 
I started to talk to him, and he spoke perfe
ct English. So I Œ I was trying to get to 
ma Œ back to my line, so he was telli
ng me where to go. And of course, I was 
hesitant, because you know, you never know. 

Q: Who is he, yeah. 

A: But I asked him, I said, how come you 
speak such good Englis
h? So he said, I 
lived in 
Ba ltimo r e
 for 30 years. And he says that
 then he went back  to his 
hometown and the war broke out. But he le
d us back to  my  lines, and he spoke 

perfect English. 
Q: Wow. 
A: He really did. But those are the only 
ones that you really meet. I Œ I sh Œ I 
hesitate, because a lot of times I™v e met pe
ople afterwards, and not Œ not during the 
war.  
Q: Yeah, I™m interested in 
figuring, and getting a picture 
of, you know, wh at your Œ 
what your experience is as you™re 
going along. You know, you™re in 
France
, then 
you cross the 
Rhine
 at Œ at Easter time, the to
wns change from poorly dressed 
people to very well dressed people.  
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo

19
Q: You know, you find some prisoners of 
war. And e Œ I don™t remember, is April 
in March or in Œ was Easter in a 
Œ in March or in April that year? 
A: I think it mu st have been March Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ or probably  Œ maybe the first of April. 

Q: Okay .  

A: Yeah. 
Q: And so it Œ 
A: That™s when General
 Patton
, you know, made his Œ he
 urinated in Œ in the
 
Rhine.
 That was his Œ 
Q: His symbol. 
A: Yeah, symbol of success. But after th
at it was Œ the war was Œ you could tell it 
was coming to an end. But then  you would 
hit pockets, there was sti ff resi stance, so 
you couldn™t relax, and y-you just 
had to be alert and watch, and Œ 
Q: But you didn™t lose that
 many men this time, after Œ 
A: No, no, that I didn™t. The Œ th e sec
ond time, the only ones we lost were minor. 
Most of my 
[indecipherable]
 was frostbite from Œ from th
e snow and all. And that 
Œ that was a miserable life, that Œ that was. 

Q: So you™re sleeping in
 the fields, or your Œ

20
A: Oh yeah. Had no place to sleep , and 
Œ and I tell you, I don™t mean to embarrass 
you, but I tell you th e worst part was going 
to  the bath room in the mo rning. I tell 
you, you pull up your pant
s and snow all in them. 
Q: It™s Œ yeah, I mean it™s Œ  

A: Yeah. 

Q: I Œ I don™t want to imagine it, but wher
e Œ what Œ what is a soldier™s life? It™s no 
fun. 
A: No, it isn™t. You actually become an animal. 
Q: You felt that way 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Oh yeah, you live like an 
animal. You learn things that
 a civilian, an American 
civilian wouldn™t recognize, but Œ you kno
w where to take cover, get under bushes. 
A-And you live Œ you live like 
an animal. You just pray 
from one spot to the other, 
and it™s a Œ it™s Œ it™s a rough life. And no
t only worrying about dying, which I never 
did. My only fear was losing my legs, I 
never wanted to  lose my  legs. Death would 
have been Œ 

Q: Preferable? 

A: As many people in these camps, de
ath would have be
en a blessing.  
Q: Yeah.

Q: Yeah.  
A: Œ but Œ but at that time, there was 
no resistance, occasionally, and th en we 

always had good billets. If you were reserve,
 they got you good housing, or decent 
housing, and Œ which was real nice. 

Q: Did you have Œ was there any news, or 
any thought at that 
point that something 
special had happened to the Je
ws? Was there any kind of Œ 

A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: Noth ing at all. The only thing th at I kne
w, see, I was going to high school, and 
we used to get a paper, and he wo
uld have, you know, how many planes 
Germany
 
was build ing every month, and this and the other. 

Q: When you were still in 
Washington
, you mean? 
A: Yeah, still a civilian. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: You know, I was in high school. And I 
Œ and th at™s the only th ing that I knew, 
and then the Œ they read you 
through th e different religious 
[indecipherable]
 they 
would say th at they™re tortur
ing the Jews, or doing this. But it Œ it Œ that was remote. 
You know, you were a 17 year old kid go

Q: Right. 
A: And Œ and you re Œ 
you didn™t have the feeling of 
it, as you did ju st reading it. 

And that made a difference, and a lot of 
them, they go Œ they
 got ed ucated very 
quick ly. 

Q: So tell me, when you were Œ you crossed the 
Rhine
, and wa Œ and it was Ap ril,

A: Yeah. 
Q: It was April. And so there™s Œ from the

 to

A: So, maybe it was in the latter p art of March.  

Q: Mm-hm. And Œ 
A: I™m Œ you know, I™m Œ I always hate to 
give these interviews, because see, I was 
an infantry person. I-In our place, we ne
ver knew where we were, we never knew 
nothing, and it Œ the 
G.I.s
 always used to say, you 
know, someday we™ll have to 
come back and see where we™ve been. And th
at™s Œ that™s what it was. And in Œ in

just one day after the other. Bu t in 
Germany
, wi Œ I was in anti-tank, which are less 
burdened, because we didn™t
 have too many trouble w
ith tanks, like we did in 
France
 and during the Battle of the Bulge. 
I mean, the Germans would come at you 
with eight, 10 tanks, so we were really bus
y. But wh en  we started to move, and then 
the battle fatigue for me, was to stay in one place. Beca
use the longer you stayed 
there, you would lo se one ma
n today, and another one tomo rrow. And finally after a 
week you™d Œ you know, you would get jitte
ry. But as long as you moving, and you 
going in to new territory, and you ju st didn
™t have that fear that you had.  
Q: And were you stalled a lot? I mean, between the 
Rhine
 and 
Mu n ich
, did you Œ 
A: Oh no, it was a steady, st
eady movement. Steady movement. 
Q: Steady movement, steady mo vement. 

A: I Œ I had gotten a Œ an ear infec
tion, and I tried to get the medics. 
[phone

Q: Excuse me.  
A: Tried to get to the me
dics and you couldn™t find a me dic, everybody was moving 
so fast.

A: It Œ it took me three days. By  that tim
e my ear was, you kn
ow, it was Œ it™s worse 
than an earache, cause I was 
in some shelling, which Œ we
ll, that™s another story. 
But Œ but that™s what it was, we 
were just mo ving along. And Œ 
Q: But the shelling, nevertheless, ha
ppened during this
 moving along? 
A: Well, ye Œ well, yeah.  
Q: What was Œ tell me 
about that a little bit. 
A: Well, the shelling was that the Germans 
used to use the p Œ th e Polish men, they 
were set up the Œ the line of resistance be
hind the German sold
iers. So when the 
German soldiers would retreat, those guys we re already set in with guns, and th at™s 

the only thing th ey had. So they  would fire. 
Q: On th e Germans? 
A: No, they would fire on us. These were Œ 

Q: The Polish? 

A: Well, they were Polish, or at 
least they claimed to be Polish. 
Q: Because the Polish we-were 
enslaved by the Germans. 

A: I know it.  

Q: So, I would be Œ you know, why would a 
German give a Pole a gun? He would Œ  
A: They Œ na Œ no, no, they
 were firing the artillery, and 
whether they were actually 
firing them, I don™t know, but 
they would dig th em in Œ

25
Q: I see. 
A: Œ and they would get the ammunition rea
dy, and they Œ they were doing it. And 
then, at that time, the Russi
an Œ the Germans, yo Œ I mean
, they were desperate, you 
know, I mean, they took  Œ just like with me with that 
German person I asked to lead 
me the way. I Œ I didn™t know whether he 
was leading me right or wrong, but I was 
desperate. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I had to take a chance. So I was Œ I 
did it right. And I had nine men with me, 
which Œ 
Q: That™s quite some repos Œ responsibility. 
A: It really is, it really is. 
Cause some of them were Œ th
ey were younger than I was. 
Some of them Œ yo-you know, it™s Œ it™s disgraceful, but when  I was in the hospital 
just for a day or two, there was a fellow ther
e, he was 18 years old, he™d been  in the 
army, I figured it was less than a year, and he
 lost a leg. Hadn™t
 been in the army. 
So Œ but that™s it Œ but we went from 
one town to the other. If I knew you were 
gonna ask me that, I Œ  

Q: It™s okay. 
A: I have sa Œ detailed map, it really shows where Œ

Q: Oh, th at would Œ that woul
d be interesting to have in
 the future. You know, that 
we could have in addition to 
your interview, that we™d 
have the map that shows the 
de Œ you know, the ro ute. 
A: Yeah 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Schweinfurt
. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And then , of course,
 Munich
 was Œ 
Q: What would Œ was Œ was that Œ 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Œ was that Œ I mean, 
Munich ™s
 a huge city, so how Œ was it bombed, was it Œ 
A: Bombed, it was Œ it was di Œ it was square
 blocks of rubbish. And my  first Œ I 
had two impressions wh en I got into 
Munich
. One was, I couldn™t understand how 
one man would allow his citizens to go thr
ough th e hell that they went through. And 
some of those civilians really had a hard
, hard life. You know, I™ve had mothers tell 
me that, you know, they  put the babies to 
bed, get them settled down, the air raid 
siren goes on, grab the kids, take them to
 the shelter, get them settled. All clear 
came out, take them back home. And that™s
 only once, but when  you do that every 
night for months, it™s hard. It™s very, very
 hard. So those Œ th-the civilians, even 
though they were Germans, I alw ays resp
ected the Germans, and I always respected 
the 
Wehrmach ts
. And so me 
G.I.s
 weren™t as liberal as I 
was, but I know when  the 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
27
war was over Œ where was I? I think it was in
 Munich
. There, they were marching 
German prisoners on the street so mewhere.
 And of course the German civilians all 
clapped, you know. And so the 
G.I.
 next to me said, what are they clapping fo r? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Said, well, that™s th eir men, th at™s th
eir citizens, they™re Germans like them, and 
you know, there™s a certain 
honor between them. You know, I would do the same 
thing. But I never had any malice toward 
an ybody. Except, I think if I would have 
ever captured 
Hitler
, man, I would have Œ 
Q: Yep. 

A: And believe it or not, I re
ally, really hoped for that. 
Q: Did you? 
A: I really did. You know, and it was a 
far fetch, I mean, you know, it™s like the 
Germans capturing 
Eisenhower. 
It™s a Œ it™s a dream.  
Q: He didn™t let that happen. 
He made sure that he wa Œ 
A: Yeah, he wa Œ he did the right thing,
 believe me, cause he
 would have ended up 
Œ 

Q: Oh yeah. He knew what was coming. 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo

28
Q: So tell me, when you were in 
Munich
 and you™re on your way to 
Da cha u
 Œ
 
hang on a second. 
[tape break] 
A: Oh, actually, it™s reversed Œ 
Q: Okay, first Œ  
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Da cha u 
Q: Œ 
Da chau
 first, before
 Munich? 
A: We went Œ yeah Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: 
Dach au 
first. And Œ and 
Da cha u
 was a two division, 45
th
 and 42
nd
, and 
incidentally, there™s a b itter bittern ess between the two. 
Q: Oh really? 
A: Yeah, they Œ one trying to claim who 
was first, who was Œ so it™s Œ til this day 
it™s a Œ  

Q: It™s a co ntroversy. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Which makes no difference. 
Q: Okay . Can you hold on just a second 
please? Okay, tell me what you saw. You Œ 
when you go to 
Da chau
, tell me what you were suppos
ed to do, and what you saw, 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
29
and what surprised you? 
A: Well, I came in from probably the south side, and I actually went though the 

gates, because the troops had been in front
 of us. But our first 
encounter, of course, 
was the railroad cars. And we came down there, and that was a shock. 

Q: What™d you see? 

A: Corpse. One just loaded, 
one car after the other, after 
the other, 50 cars, I think 
there were. 
Q: 50 cars? 
A: Of Œ of just Œ 

Q: Corpses. 
A: Œ corp ses. And th e sad things that you 
run into is they were coming down  and 
there was Œ some lady had Œ who was on a tr
ain, had gotten off with her baby, and 
she no so oner got off th e car th
an she collapsed, I guess, cau
se what we saw is they 
were dead. And she died, and the baby ou
tlived the mother. And you could tell that 
she was grabbing her mo ther™s breast, pulli
ng her clothes away to Œ for something 
to eat. And then you see two 
of them dead, just sitting 
there, mother and whatever, 
they were. But the thing 
is, to think that they had to su
ffer, that™s the part that Œ that 
is Œ that™s unbelievable. And those cars that 
they rode in, see, I rode in those cars 
under ideal conditions, and it wasn™t Œ it wasn™t Œ 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
30
Q: It was not ideal conditions. 
A: It was not, oh no, not there. 

Q: Did you know who those 
people were, the corpses, di
d you know who they were 
by th at point? 

A: Oh, th ere was no way you coul
d have told one from the other. 
Q: No, no, no, I mean by Œ did you know if 
they were Jews, did 
you know if they 
were Poles? Did you know wh
y Œ you know, did you know 
who they were a-at that 
point, wh en you came upon them? 

A: No, no, I didn™t. 

Q: You didn™t. 
A: But the assumption would be
 that they™re Jews. I think 
the final calculations in 
their books, they™ll tell you ho
w many Jews were involved. 
Q: But when  you were going th rough th ere,
 and you™re seeing this, you had no idea 
who these corpses were? 
A: Just dead corpses. 
Q: Just dead corpses. An
d then  wh en you got into 
Da cha u
, was there anybody 
living? 
A: Oh yeah, there were the Œ 
they Œ they had there Œ some
 of Œ some of the people 
were dead, living dead. I don™
t know if you ever seen 
a doctor when he tries to 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
31
verify if somebody died, they
 pull the eyelids ba
ck to look in his eyes. Cause you 
can look in the ey
e and you can tell whether he™s living 
[indeciphera ble]
. And 
that™s the way these people were, they just
 had a dead eye. They lo oked straight 
ahead, and they™re noth
ing but skin and bones. And after we left 
Dachau
, they were 
losing 200 a day. Afte
r we got there.  
Q: What you Œ did you 
talk to any of them? 
A: No. They were filthy and dirty. Some 
of the people come up and they would try 
to hug you, and I push away. And one thin
g that really bothers me, some lady, she 
must have had a bottle of wine, and she want
ed to gi-give it, part of it to me. And 
she™s starving, you know, and 
she wanted to give me part of it. And I-I Œ I ca Œ I 
mean, I couldn™t drink out of it. I mean, it wa
s just the filth, the smell, I mean, y-you 
just couldn™t. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: No way. And some of them, I guess they
 fa Œ you know, they
 tried to hug you, 
and Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And you Œ you ju st had to pu
sh them away, push them away. 
Q: Did Œ 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
32
A: But what I did, after we walked, this wa
s the other part of our
 division, they had 
to secure the re Œ the camp. There were 
some  prisoners who were in good shap e Œ 
not good shape, but they  were better shape. 
Q: Better shape. 
A: Course, the Œ all they wanted to do wa
s get out. And they had to  contain th em, 
which wasn™t an easy job to do. 

Q: Why would they  had to be contained? 
A: Because they were all diseased , there 
was a lot of disease 
in the camp. They 
didn™t want the prisoners r
unning around in  the streets of 
Munich
, in Œ in a diseased 
state.  

Q: And I can imagine that the prisoners coul
dn™t understand, now if you™re liberated 
us, how come you don™t let us go? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah. But Œ bu
t wh at they did, th-they 
[indecipherable]
 they came in 
with blankets, they came in 
with food, and Œ and they  took care of th em. And they 
weren™t there that long. They  weren't there that long. I got a Œ 

Q: Were there any guards that were there? 

A: Oh yeah Œ 
Q: Were there any Germans that you fo und? 
A: Œ oh yeah, yeah, they
 Œ well, I didn™t Œ our division didn™t hit them. 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo  
 
March 1, 2010 
 

 
 
33
Q: Okay . 
A: The 45
th
 division, they hit the 
barracks. And they killed 
Œ they killed Œ I think 
there was 35 
SSs, 
they never lived to 
tell the tale. And they had electric fence 
around th e camp, that wasn™t turned on, wh
ich made it easier for their Œ the troops 
in front of us. And then , the pride I ta
ke getting Œ walk ing do
wn  by those railroad 
tracks, the
 G.I.s
 in front of me, they heard a mo
an. And they climbed up, and they 
literally had to walk on corpses, I mean it.
 T h ey finally get to this one fellow, and 
they pulled him out and he was still alive. 
And imagine just being in with a bunch 
of dead people, you know? 
And Œ but they  got him on a 
Jeep
, I saw that, and they 
took him away, I guess th
ey took him to the medics. And the joy part of 
[indecipherable]
 is that in ™95, which is 50
th
 anniversary of the liberation, I went to 
it in Œ in Œ in 
Munich
, this fellow that they pulle
d out came to that reunion. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: And I tell you, he was a hero. I think everybody Œ 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Œ and he Œ he had become a very wea
lthy person, doing Œ I d
on™t know what he 
did, but he got involved  in some business 
or something. But he
 was living, and you 
would never know th at he came out of a Œ 

Q: Pile of corpses.

A: A pile of corpses. 
Q: My goodness. 

A: And my Œ you know, you 
ge Œ i-i Œ it™s destiny. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: You know, it™s like in th
e army , you know, you Œ you 
advance, and this fellow 
gets shot, this one da Œ and you keep wa
lking, you know. You 
Œ you can™t explain 
that. 
Q: What did you Œ what did you th ink, or
 do you remember what
 you thought when  
you were walking th rough he
re, because I don™t Œ you know, you weren™t expecting 
to see this, right? You weren™t Œ 

A: Oh no, you Œ we didn™t e
xpect to find a Œ a Œ th-the 
magnitude that it was. It was 
just Œ there was just corpse everywhere. An
d the thing I remember is that lady with 
the baby in her arms. I™ll ne
ver forg et that. And the othe
r ones in the crematories, I 
went in there, and the soil had so mu ch bl
ood in it, that i-it had a purple brownish 
color. It just didn™t look like dirt, but just 
from the saturation of th
e Œ of the blood.  
Q: Of the blood.  
A: It™s just that, and the other one that 
I always remembered was the Œ the Œ the Œ 
the inmates had a Œ to  wash up, if you want
 to call it that, it™s like an umbrella 
opened up, and at the top, the water woul
d come from the top, and come down and 

 
Interview with Romeo Fagiolo

35
then it would all wash. But the dirt, the 
stench, the Œ ye Œ I-I 
mean, how couldyou 
go there and clean up? I mean, it wa
s so filthy, you know, just oh. 
Q: About how many people, do you know, 
were in the camp 
when Œ when you Œ 
A: Close to 30,000. 
Q: When you guys walked in
to it, there still were abou
t 30,000 people in there? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Th
ey Œ I tell you, this book give it all Œ I mean, I Œ this is 
where I get it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: But th-they broke it down Œ they broke
 it down by, you know, different people. 

But the Jews were always the most. They
 were the largest number. I have to Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. How lo ng were you there in 
Dachau? 
A: 
Dach au
, I went in there that Su
nday afternoon, and I stayed
 in the Œ we left, and 
I stayed in a building, it wa
s an office building. And th e two th ings I reme mb er in 
there were Œ you know, they 
used to have red ink andblack ink on the desk. And 
the 
G.I.s
 as they go through th
ere, get the ink and throw it against the wall. And 
then they  had a bust of 
Hitler
 stan ding there, and I thi
nk everybody that went by 
shot it. I-It was just perforated with Œ 

Q: Holes.

A: Œ holes. So 
[indecipherable]
. And then I left that mo rn
ing, and that™s when they 
were bringing th e Œ the Œ the people from the city of 
Da chau
. Wh ich people don™t 
understand, but that™s a very intellectual c
ity. There™s colleges th
ere, and so fo rth, 
and being associated with the 
camp didn™t help  them at all. 
Q: No. 
A: But anyway, that morning they were 
bringing people in. 
So mebody Œ you Œ you 
want to stop? 
Q: No, no, no, no, hang on a minute. 
Well, let™s see. All right. But Œ okay. 
A: But anyway, they Œ 
they brought them in. 
Q: They bro
ught them in. 
A: They brought them
 in, and the women, you know, 
they  would get their coats and 
walk through the place, and course they all denied that they knew anything about it. 
Nobody in 
Germany
 was a Œ was a Nazi, you know. 
Q: Right.
