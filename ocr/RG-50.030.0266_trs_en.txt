September 13, 1990
 
 
Question: Could you pl
ease tell me your name?
 
Answer: My name's R obert Zimmer.  
I now live in Williamsburg, Virginia.
 
Q: Where and when  were you born?
 
A: I was born in Buffalo, New Yo
rk, on the 28th of April 1924.
 
Q: Could you tell us a little bit ab out what Bu
ffalo was like, your 
childhood was like in 
Buffalo?
 
A: Well, I was part of the working class co
mmunity. My dad was a machinist on the Erie 
Railroad, and we lived throug
h the Depression, wh ich was sort of harrowing at times, 
especially one Christmas Eve wh
en my dad came home and said
 he was laid off, and then 
that he was out of work  about
 six months, and then he got 
back to  work  again; things 
improved from that point.  So I was a Depres
sion child. We didn't k n ow we were poor.  
We -- I went to public school, walked, oh, 
eight-tenth s of a mile I guess.  I was a 
kindergartner.  And then  went through high 
school.  Obviously, for my size, I p layed 
basketball, but it was a small high school.  Th ere were only 44 of us in the graduating 

class.  I married a girl from the graduating cl
ass, back then.  I've known her since we 
were in kindergarten I guess, and -- but we 
didn't date until going to the senior prom 
together.  By that time Pearl Harbor had 
happened, and ev erybody was going off to war 
or working in the war industri
es. I decided I wanted to go to
 college, although, I'd been  
the first one in our family to graduate from hi
gh school even.  My 
two older sisters, they
 
are 10, 14 years older than I am, they left
 school as sophomo res to help support the 
family.  And my folks sa
id that I didn't have to support 
the family if I went to college, 
and that was all the help they could give me 
for going away to school. I went to the state 
teacher's college at Brockport, New York.  
I had enlisted in the Œ 
enlisted Reserve Corp 
in July of '42, and was called to active duty th
en in April of '43. Th
is enough background 
of growing up in  Bu ffalo or not?
 
Q: No, that's fine.
 
A: Okay .
 
Q: In '42, after enlistin g, can you tell us br
iefly wh at led up to  you
r activity in Europe?
 
A: Well, as I said, I'd enlisted in the Reserves
, and they had permitted me to start college.  
Then  in April '43 I went on active duty, went
 through processing at 
Port Agra, and then 

ended up in basic training at 
Camp McQuaide in the Coast 
Guard Artillery.  I ap plied for 
a -- OCS, the Bo ston candidate school toget a commission.  My  battery comm ander 
recommended that we take our applications 
back and apply for an army specialized 
training program, ASTP, which promised us 
18 months of college training, and then 
officers candidate school training. That sounde
d awfully good to me, and I said okay, and 
I went to Stanford University
 for processing, and then  to the Univ ersity of Oregon at 
Eugene, Oregon, to study engineering.  This
 was the most intense academic work I had 
ever gone th rough.  Treme
ndous number of courses that 
we had to take.  We had 
supervised study every evening.
  We started at 6:00 o'cloc
k in th e mo rning, and had a 
schedule back then until 
10:00 o'clock at 
night; and then lights were
 out at 10:30, so we 
didn't  have much free time. Then in April of 
'43, this program closed down  because of the 
anticipation of the invasion of Europe, and th
ese troops were really in a holding pattern, 
we now realized, and we went to fill up the 
vacancies in the 11th 
Armored Division, and 
I became a -- well, I w ent to 
the 22nd Tank Battalion Comp
any, AV, for medium tanks, 
and I was a bowl gunner, or a BOG, and an  assistant driver on one of the Sh erman tank, 
medium tank.  And they gave us, oh, several 
review of basic training, taught us how to 
drive a tank and how to sh
oot a 75-millimeter gun from th
e tank, and while we're doing 
things, basic survival, but we got the divisi
on -- well, the division was getting ready to 
ship overseas then, in Augu
st, and we moved from Califor
nia -- Camp  Cooke, California 
to the East Coast, and I think that was Ca
mp Kilmer, New Jersey, 
and went to board  a 
ship one night, the SS  Samaria, and half of
 the division was on it, 
about 5,000 men, and 
they congratulated us, that it was only single 
loaded.  By th
at they meant that we didn't 
have to sh are our bunks with
 anybody.  Because in double 
loaded you have one bunk fo r 
two people, and we were able 
to sleep for eight hours and 
the other guy would sleep for 
eight hours.  But we had bunks by ourselves. 
And I shouldn't say bunk.  It was actually -- 
they were hammocks that were
 strung across the dining room tables and the back  table 
there. It was a very, very quiet crossing, 
but we had British food
, and the British didn't 
make any friends among th ese American troops
 with  the kind of fo
od th ey gave us and 
the service we got.  We were very unhappy w
ith the Brits on this score.  I don't know if 
any of the other guys told you 
about it, but we had close to food riots on the ship . We did 
see -- we w ere called to the general quarters se
veral times, and we did see some action of 
death charges being dropped.  It was a larg
e convoy, and-- so I pr
esume that they had 
some alerts that there were u-boats stalking or
 trying to attack the convoy. We landed in 
Liverpool, and much to our 
surprise saw the headlines of
 the newspaper saying the SS 
Samaria had been  sunk, and we got off the 
ship, and we were glad the news headline 
wasn't true. Then  they put us 
on trains and took us to the s
outhern  part of England near 
Warminister where we drew tanks and had 
to  clean up the equipment, because these 
tanks had been stored, a lot of Cosmoline, it's 
heavy grease on all parts.  It 's quite a chore 
cleaning it up and getting them 
in working condition.  Then
 we had to check out the 
tanks, drive them enough to  road  test them
 an d get a few miles on them so we were 

confident that they weren 't 
going to breakdown when we need
ed them. And then on about 
the 16th or 17th of D
ecember -- I'm skipping over.  We ha
d a few trips to London, and I 
did get into London 
in what they  called a buzz bomb 
alley where there was a lot of 
damage, and I was in London one night, a
nd when  some buzz bomb s came in, we could 
hear the explosions and see the flashes, a
nd the anti-aircraft wa
s going off.  So having 
been in London du
ring some of the attacks, we were 
getting a poor taste of what the war 
was going to  be like. On  the 16th or 17th of
 Decemb er we moved to Wayland, England, 
and board ed  an LST.  It's a landing ship tank
 that were under the auspices of the U.S. 
Navy. And we really envied  
the navy guys because they ha
d clean beds with  sheets, 
showers, and a good cafeteria, good food, and 
a greatly enjoyed being guests of the Navy 
for that short cross of the ch
annel, which was just overnight
.  We landed in Sibret, and 
then unlo ading the tanks, our tank had an  acci
dent.  We were the numb er three tank being 
loaded, and so we're 
almost the last tank 
to unload. While the LST had a basketball 
backboard  Œ so wh en th ey didn't  -- weren't 
carrying tanks, the crew could shoot baskets 
or something.  Anyhow, our tank was under 
it, and the motion of unloading the tanks, the 
backboard  had dropped loose, 
and it swung down .  Well, our gunner reached up to  move 
that so the hatch of the tank wouldn't hit 
it.  Our tank commander was down on th e deck 
directing our driver to get the tank off the 
LST.  Well, just as our gunner, Edmonton -- 
and most of these guys I refer to them by their 
last name Œ had reached out to lift this up.  
Martiburg [ph] gave Trevy  [p
h] the signal to move out, a
nd he did, and Edmonton caught 
his hand between this backboard  and the ch
ariot top.  And he crushed two or three 
fingers, and part of his hand. Well, this 
was a real medical emergency, and nobody's 
around to  help, so we bypass the column , an
d delivered Edmonton to  a hospital by tank.  
We picked  up a mo torcycle escort and drov e through Sibret, and had -- the mo torcycle 

MP didn't realize the tank could go that 
fast.  We had steel tracks, and th is was 
December, so it was cold weather, and they  were
 cobblestone streets with streetcar tracks 
on th em, and we were skidding and swerving. 
 In fact, we made about two turns where 
our tank went -- spint 360 degr
ees around befo re we changed di
rections.  And, in fact, we 
almost ran over another motorcycle.  The M-vi
ew was directing traffic, and he let the -- 
our escort come through, and he put up his ha
nd fo r us to stop, and 
we weren't stopping, 

and he scramb led to get out of
 the way, and then we had tw
o motorcycle escorts.  Well, 
we got to this hospital, and I had the distin
ction of bein g -- delivering the first patient 
ever by tank to this hospital.
  And I actually carried Edm
onton.  He was a small slight 
man, older than the rest of us, he was in ou
r mid to late 30's, a
nd we didn't see him until 
the war was over, and heard that he had lost tw
o fingers and part of the palm of his hand. 
Then we got back to the co
mpany, and loaded up with ga
s and ammunition, because at 
this point we didn't know that there was a ba
ttle in the Bulge.  We were originally 
scheduled to go to Calais and help -- well, 
sort of contain about 10,000 Germans that had 
been bypassed, and this was sort of our intr
oduction to  comb at.  We
 weren't going to  go 
in and capture them, but we weren't going to
 let them co me out either.  They had live 

ammunition, we had live ammuniti
on, we shot, we killed, but we were just going to make 
sure that they didn't move.  
That was the original plans that
 we had. Well, they changed 
that when the Battle of the Bulge started, and 
they gave orders to 
our division to travel 
from Sibret directly to Bastogne.  This was a 
-- I'd say a force -- it was a force smart.  We 
drove until we ran out of gas, and the truck 
came by, handed up a ga
s can, we loaded up 
and kept going. We dr
ove through Paris -- oh, this mu st 
have been  about 
the 24th -- 23rd, 
24th.  I want to say it was the 24th of Decemb
er, Christmas Eve.  Now the people in Paris 
knew about the Battle of the Bu
lge.  They knew the German
 breakthrough, and we were 
being inundated with propaganda, that th
e Germans were going to be in Paris by 
Christmas.  Well, the American Armored Divisi
on is a pretty impressive show of force to 
drive thro ugh th e city, and the pe
ople in Paris were out on the sidewalks, there were eight 
and ten gates, they were tryi
ng to climb up on the tanks gi
ving us eggs and flowers and 
fruit.  Everything we wanted, but 
our orders were not to stop, very specific not to stop. I 
reme mb er driving up to  the Arc of Triumph 
and making a sharp left turn, and drove on 
through to Sanson.  And all the time it was ju
st hurry , keep going, keep going.  It's 
Sanson they  gave us a break to do some 
ma intenance on the tanks, and I shouldn't use 
that word "break," b
ecause we had to work 
awfully hard.  We had to break -- take the 
track apart, and take the connectors that linke
d each section of track.  These come off as a 
big one-inch nut on it, and you 
have to take that apart, ta ke that off, then with a 
sledgehammer knock the connector off.  And 
then we put on a new connector or an 

extender.  We call them duckbills
, which would extend the widt
h of the track about four 
to five inches.  And, again, these have to
 be put on with a sle
dgehammer, and then the 
nuts put back on and tighten ed up, and it wa
s not easy wo rk; heavy physical work, as 
well as track -- threading that 
track up over the drive wheels
 and sprockets of the tank. 
They  had promised us a turkey dinner for Chri
stmas day, and they  delivered it.  We got 
turkey, but that was all we got, 
turk ey and bread; no fixings, 
but we had turk ey .  Well, at 
this point they discovered that our tank, this
 is tank A3, had a bad transmission and so th e 
rest of the division went on, and we stay
ed with ordinance while they repaired  and 
eventually they replaced the 
transmission, and then they
 decided it was an engine 
problem; they replaced the engine. So the di
vision went on to Ne
ufchâteau and through 
Bastogne, and got into action 
very quick ly.  Ou r tank was be
hind, so we missed the first 

day Œ first several days of acti
on.  In fact, when we got up 
to Neufchâteau, they held us 
there until -- they thought the division was co
ming off the line, and 
they didn't , so we 
were several days there.  We didn't know wh
ere we were going to, just stayed put. I had 
some interesting stories as we were trave
ling by ourselves.  I remember, this was now 
snow and ice, and I remember one little French
 boy, I would guess mu
st have been seven 
or eight years old, about that high, came by 
the side of the road. 
 He looked cold and 
miserable.  We stopped, and put some wool 
socks on him, and a hat, and gave him some 
candy bars, and muffled him up as best as we
 could, but we had to  go, but he did look 
like a very forlorn waif by the side of the ro
ad. Then as we were driving beyond here, 

now we're in France into Belgium,
 in that line there, a one-la
ne road, and it had sort of a 
crown on it to help drainage, but it was all 
ice and snow, and it was snowing.  This was 
very tricky driving, because if we kept th
e tank balanced  on the top of the crown, we 
made good progress. If it was off balance, we'd  slide down to one side until we hit the 
ditch and got some soft dirt, and then the tr
acks would dig in and br
ing us up on top of 
the thing, but usually we'd  go 
up too far and then we'd  slide down  the other side.  So we 
were going down the road like 
this, up one side, down the ot
her. This was all right until 
we noticed that along both side
s of the road there were thes
e large trees, and they were, 
oh, at least that big around.  These trees 
were all notched, and they  had little white boxes 
all wired around them.  And we discovered late
r that these were boxes of TNT, and that 
was primer cord, and this wh
ole road had been mined like 
that in case the Germans did 
break thro ugh from Bastogne.  They would ha
ve blown all these trees, and it would have 

been like jackstraws ac
ross that road, and th ey  would have
 been denied to
 the Germans.  
This concerned me driving down th
at road. First of all, we di
dn't -- we could see probably 
blowing that road while we were there.  A
ll we could see is bumping into so mething and 
setting the whole thing up.  So that was a ha
rrowing experience. Then
 we caught up with 
the division, and as I said, we waited, and 
then we were in the 
area around Longchamps 
which is, oh, two or three kilometers from Ba
stogne, in and around that area, and we -- 
our company became part of CC
R.  The 11th Armored Division
 was divide -- made up of 
three combat comman d s.  Co
mb at command CCA or CCB  or CCR.  And there could be 
any co mb ination of battalions or comp anies in
 either one depending on th e mission. Well, 
the mission of Comb at Command Ark, CCR, wa
s to support whichever -- A or B -- had 

the main action; in case of any 
difficulty, we'd back them up, 
in case they broke through, 
then we were to go thro ugh the break and expl
oit it.  So we were always moving here and 
there depending on what the action was.  
Sometimes we'd  move three or four times 
during a night, maybe -- frequently , mo re than 
that, almost like a ch
ess game, to get in 
position where we expected the German thrust
 to be. And I rememb er painting our tanks 
white, or whitewashing them, so we could hardly
 see them with all that snow around, and 

it was very cold.  Getting up in
 the mo rning, I'd take half 
three-quarters of an inch of 
gauze across the inside of the tank.  There's no 
heaters in the tank, and we'd  just be sitting 
there, and as long as one man was on the radio, 
the rest of us could sleep, so we'd  take 

turns doing that, but it was co
ld.  And sometimes we'd  b e in position. I remember one -- 
this little valley where the forward slope of th
e valley, and on the other side of the knoll 

was our German column.  This morning at 
dawn , bright and clear, blue sky, it was 
beautiful, and our friends in the 19th ?Aka
l? Air Command came over with their P-47s, 
and attacked this German colu
mn.  Now, the column was out
 of sight, it was on the other 
side of this hill, but we c
ould see the people dive down, we could see the machine guns 
going, we could see them drop bo
mbs, and it actually disappear
ed around the crest of the 
hill.  And after, oh, a half hour or so we go
t orders to move, that we were no lo nger 

needed there. Air Force had taken care of the 
threat, so we moved to another position, but 
that was a lot of the kinds of activity we were doing.
 
Q: Do you reme mb er any un
derground resistance as you were going from actio n to 
action?
 
A: No, we didn't  run into un
derground.  We were very symp
athetic to the Belgiums.  I 
reme mb er we wou ld  co me acro ss so me o f th
e Belgium homes that had been overrun by 
the Germans, and I remember one little cottage  we came into, and there was an elderly 
woman, I'd say an old woman, 
maybe in her 80's.  She was s
till laying in bed.  She had a 
bullet hole in her head , and we had no need  for 
it.  Of course, there were all sorts of dead 
animals aro u nd, but when it wa
s cold, that didn't bother us. 
 When it thawed that became 
a problem. We were into the Bulge and ha
d heard about the massacre of Normandy, and 
that was in the north ern section of Bulge, a nd the 11th was not involv ed in th at, but that 

went through that the whole American army I 
think.  The Germans were not nice, and we 
weren't going to  take 
any prisoners either.
 
Q: How many people were killed?
 
A: Oh, the massacre of Norman
dy, about 160 I think. These 
were American solders that 
had been captured  by the Germans and 
they were machine 
gunned.  So the 11
th
 decided 
not to take any prisoners for a while.  And,  in fact, General Patton had come down to  
division headquarters, which is quite a wa
y down s by the chain of co mmand, to give 
direct orders to our division and commander that
 we were to take prisoners, and -- but we 
established our reputation th en, and, so, we didn't 
wear patches, so -- we
 didn't want to be 
captured by the Germans;
 they didn't like us.
 
Q: Patches?
 
A: Shoulder patches showing th at we were
 memb ers of the 11th Armo red Division, a 
triangular patch that's red, ye
llow and blue with the 11th on 
it. And so  we fought through 
the Bulg e, and that was a big battle.  I unders
tand that there were about 80,000 American 
casualties, and a 100,000 German 
casualties in about six weeks.
  So it was a lot of very 
serious fighting, and small acti
on is big action, and so on. We
 helped in the pinching off 
of the Bu lge, drawing up with 
the First Army, part of the 41
st
 Calvary, and Major Greene, 
or General Greene now, led that group to do th
at, and that was at H ouffalize.  And then 
from that point on we started pushing the Ge
rmans back, and we moved in to Luxemburg 
to bridge the sick-pick line, and we finally 
broke through at Prüm or Prüm, I guess it is.  
And at the time sat at the Prüm
 River.  And from that point th
en we made a dash to the 
line getting near Coblenz, took 
a breather there Œ a breather, a couple of days -- and then  
they started moving us upstream of the line, 
so I guess we'd  be moving east, and closed 
off the Saar-Moselle Triangle. That took a larg
e amount of prisoners.  I reme mber that 
kind of action, because at ni
ght we could see German sear
ch lights on the Rhine forming 

a huge "v".  So the German troops -- beca
use they were disorganized .  There were 
individuals of small units, you know, with nowher
e to go to get across.  Of course, we 
were killing them off, and taki
ng them prisoners, and sending them back making sure 
they didn't get across. We go
t to the line, and we crosse
d at --near Worms on a pontoon 
bridge, and much to our surpri
se there was the Navy in th
eir Navy uniforms with their 
white sailor caps manning the pontoon rig, wh
ich was with smoke pots all around so  we 
couldn't -- but nobody could see it, but drivin
g a tank across that was -- across the Rhine 
on a pontoon bridge was sort of disconcerting 
shall we sa y?  Everybo
dy had their hatches 
open.  We'r e standing with their heads out in 
case that bridge went down , that we 'd  have 
somewhat of a chance to get 
on the tank. We crossed there.  And we started driving 
through Central Europe, heading toward -- we
ll, it was actually East Germany now, and 
captured an arms plant -- a Walther arms pl
ant at -- in Zella-Meh
lis, andwe're into 
Czechoslovakia, and we were the first American
 troops to cross the Czech border, but we 
were pulled back and told that 
the Russians were supp
osed to have our case in Prague in  
Czechoslo vakia.  So we went south along 
the Czech/German border into Au stria, and 
through Linz.
 
Q: What is this timeframe?
 
A: Timeframe, March/April of '45.  We were
 moving very fast.  One time we -- the 
Germans let us go through, and then they cut o
ff our supplies, so we had to -- I think that 
was in Komb ach.  Don't quote me on that name, but we were cut off there, and we had to  
send our trucks with  our light tanks back to  
fight the way through the Germans in order to 
get supplies and bring supplies up so we could 
keep  mo ving.  And we 'v e heard that they'd  
give us maps expecting us to co ver the 20 mile
s in two or three days, and we'd  do that in 

a half a day, and we have to wait for maps so
 we can go on. Of c
ourse, the Germans were 
very disorganized at this point
, and wh en th ey did resist, it wa
s sort of a last ditch stand, 
but we were moving very fast, and the Armo
red Division just -- with CCA and CCB, they  
just use a pincers movement, and cut 
them off, and we'd  just keep going.
 
Q: At this point the war 
was turning back clearly __?
 
A: Yes, a little.  Again, in the front line, 
we didn't know what was happening elsewhere.  
We were Œ We didn't h ave ra
dios or news broadcasts, we 
did get newspapers.  Every day 
was another day at comb at.  We'r e just pre
ssing on.  A lot of my  impressions are, you 

know, hindsight.  The day-to-day
 activities w ere just to keep
 that tank going, and drive 
until we hit resistance, and then
 we deploy to fight. So I remember o n e time in Briod, it 
was the first -- only time we had to dismount 
from our tanks and fight 
on foot.  This was -
- This is scary for a tanker. A tanker feels ve
ry comfortable with that steel around th em.  
But there was a hospital there w
ith British pilots there, and we
 couldn't get to it because 
bridges had been blown up, and we had to 
go across the bridges in the water, and then 
deploy to  take them down. The Germans who we
re guarding the Brits were very happy to  

surrender, so they -- there was no resistance. Bu
t at the time they told
 us to dismount, we 
didn't  know what we were going to run into, 
and you never do, but we were able to cap -- 
to relieve the -- liberate these British flyers, 
and turn the German prisoners we had over 
to them, and they took care of it, and --
 
Q: What happened as your
 division approached Ma
uthausen, or how many __+?
 
A: We captu red Linz, and we we
re the first troops 
into Austria.  We 
captured Linz, and 
actually had heavier fighting at
 Linz then we had since th
e Battle of the Bulge.  The 
others had been rather sporadic.  So we took
 a lot of casualties going into Linz. To give 
you a little bit of a feel of this, I remember goi
ng into Linz.  There was a railroad that was 
in a cut that was down, oh, I'd say, four feet 
below the road.  The road was next to it, and 
then there's a mountainside going up.  On ly  r oom for one tank.  Two tanks co uldn't pass 
each other on this road.  Comi
ng up the mountain road, around
 a bend, where a group of 
about, oh, 15 to 20 kids on bi
cycles.  They were the Hitler yo
ung.  They were in military 
unifo rm, and strapped to each bicycle was a Panz
erfaust, an anti-tank weapon.  It looked 
like a football at the en d of a hockey stick. 
They were coming, and 
we were going down , 
and we weren 't going to let th
em get close, so -- and a kid 
on a bicycle is -- and I say a 
kid, these were 12, 13, 14 year
s old.  And we had to open up with  machines guns. It 
wasn't pretty.  Some of them tried to clim
b the mountain side, they couldn't do that, and 

they couldn't drop down to the railroad cut, we
'd  just drove right through it.  That was 
going in to Linz. After Linz we
 kept going, and finally me
t the Russians.  Now, this 
beyond Mauthausen.  At this point we had a co
mp any, 22nd Tactic, part of CCA, Comb at 
Command Day, and we were one of the le
ad comp anies.  So we had bypassed 
Mauthausen.  Other units of the 11
th
 found Mauthausen.  We started getting rumors from 
our guys, the cooks and bakers
 who were going back fo r supp
lies, that they had found a 
concen tration camp.  And some of the rumors
 we heard were that there were bodies 

stuffed down wells, that there were bodies stack
ed as cord wood all 
over the place.  They  
even said that they had foun
d some lamp shades made out of human skin that had tattoos 

on them.  This came at the time 
when we got to Russia. Now,
 the deal with the Russians 
were that there would be a ten mile buffe
r zone from the Russians and the American 

Army, and they were between 
the Germans that were trying 
to surrender, and they were 
desperately trying to surrender 
to the Americans rath
er than the Russia
ns.  And at this 
point a large number of the 12
th
 SS Panzer Group surrendered 
to our lines.  We were to -- 
they were supposed to surrende
r to  the Ru ssians but didn't. 
We finally took them under 
control, and our control was just an open fi
eld, and we mark it off with telephone wire, 
just strung telephone wire about
 tw o or three strands of it on 
pipes or posts stuck in the 
ground.  There was a stream flowing th rou
gh the field. I don't know how many th ousand 
troops and Germans were in there.  We ha
d set up our tanks at about a hundred foot 

intervals, and we just round
ed th e machine gun between th
e tanks.  And we weren't going 
to let any Germans get out. We weren 't ve
ry careful about them
.  If we saw any 

movement, a machine gun would 
go off.  We didn't care if 
it sprayed through the camp.  
Some of our guys saw some Germans trying 
to swim in the stream, and, again, we 
machine gunned them, and let fl
y a whole round of ammunitio
n just to make sure. We 
didn't  have facilities to feed 
them, so periodically
, like every other day or so, we'd  shoot a 
horse and drag it into the camp, and it was up 
to them to butcher it and how to distribute 
the meat however they want.  That was abou
t the only food we could give them.  This 
was going on while Mauthausen  
was being cleaned up and made, quote, Su itable for 
human habitation.  In other word s, other 
members -- parts of our Division were at 

Mauthausen taking care of the sick, burying th
e dead, and because -- there's talk Œ finding 
the camp, it was a surprise to
 the Division.  We weren't prepared fo r it.  We didn't know 
they existed.  We had no id ea of the extent 
of it.  We didn't have food, we didn't have 
medics to help the people. Some of the peop
le died just running 
to our tanks and half 
tracks.  Emotionally, they were 
drained, but physically they were kind of a skeleton.  The 
food we had wasn't ap propriate for a person 
who was -- had been on
 a starvation diet.  
And they  started eating food too fast, and this
 didn't  agree with their stomachs, and so  
they would get even sticker, and many of them
 died.  It was a very sad thing, but we 
didn't  know, because the medics co uld have be
en backing us up, but we were so far ahead 

-- actually, the 11th, when the war was over, we
 were the furthest east of any American 
troop.  We were way east of Berlin.  Most
 people don't  realize that the Third Army had 
gotten that far east.  And our lines were awfu
lly far extended.  And 
it was a difficult thing 
for them to bring the resources up to take care
 of these people, and, fortunately, we were 
able to save off many of them.
 
Q: When your division first went in -- I real
ize you weren't there, 
so -- but other members 
were, what happened to the SS
 who were the head of th e cam
ps?  D o  you know whatever 
happened to the upper echelon the day 
in Europe under yo
ur supervision --
 
A: What I'v e heard was that when the tanks 
got close to the camp, the Germans ran, they 
left, and I don't know if they were captured or 
if they were able to hide themselves or 
what.  The -- I'm sure the reac
tion of the guys was that, if th
ere was no resistance, we had 
to do something with these si
ck and dying people.  You k
now, thousands of people that 
are dying, some dying as you're lo oking at th
em.  It was something that nobody was 
prepared for.  And I'm sure that we weren '
t -- the guys weren't concerned about the 
guard s that had run away. But I know in  other -- let's see.  What was the name of that 
town?  Well, we hit a small city that had a lo
t of forced labor, slav
e labor, mainly French 
and Dutch people.  Wh en we lib
erated that, the French and 
th e Du tch took care of their 
guard s very quickly , and not very  humanly ; they
 just beat them up, and beat them to 
death.  And I imagine if there were any surv
ivors over at the camp, were in physical 
condition, they got thei
r hands on the guards at Mauthausen
.  They were treated the same 
way.
 

Q: Do you if there were men a
nd women who were at the camp ?
 
A: There were men and wo men and ch ildren.  I'
ve been back to th e 
camp -- I w ent back 
there about five years ago. 
 T h e camp  was ma d e  up  main ly  o f  E a st E u rop ean s, man y  
Poles, Latvians, Estonians, Bulgarian, ther
e were even a few Americans, 2- or 300 
Americans in that camp. There were predom
inantly Jewish, but there were other people 
there too.  They were, I guess, ma
sons and catholics and the thing.
 
Q: __?
 
A: Yeah.  So there were all sorts of people in there.  We could see the grave sites, mass 
grave in the film that some of
 the guys in the division took.
  We used our bulldozers to 
dig out the grave, but the Ge
rmans in the local community 
-- I guess this was Austria, I 
should say Austria, it 's in 
Norw ood really -- denied knowing anything about this camp .  
That is hard to believe because of the sten
ch that was coming from the camp.  You could 
smell it for miles away.  And the sight, you
 might imagine, but the smell no one can 
imagine. Well, we got the local people to he
lp bury, and so we made them place each 
body in the trench as 
gently as they could.  We filled 
the trench, and then had them put 
dirt over them with shovels, but once there was 
covering of dirt, then we used  a bulldozer 
to put more dirt over them, and then put an
other layer of bodies in. The danger from 
disease was so great we had to
 get these bodies -- there's th
ousands of them Œ into the 
ground, and we had to get them buried.
 
Q: How close was the closest town to the c
oncentration camp?  You said you could smell 
this for miles?
 
A: Mauthausen overlooks the 
Danube River, and the town of
 Mauthausen.  I would guess 
the distance from the town
 to the camp was maybe three kilo
meters.  Not very far.  That's 
why it stretches the imagination that they 
wouldn't  know what was happening there, 
because the shift of th
e wind, they'd know it.
 
Q: What was the town peoples' response 
when  your division had come in and then 
realized that the camp was being liberated?  
Did they  have a response to the people who 
had been in the camps?
 
A: I don't know.  Remember, 
we had bypassed it.  The people lived in a small farming 

village, and everybody there denied being 
Nazi, denied knowing anything about the 
camps.  This village was pretty remote from Ma
uthausen.  We were about 20 or 30 miles 
from them by th at time.  And th ey didn't have
 good co mmunication, just a -- had to take a 
dirt road to get into th
e village, in fact.  So -- and that's 
-- Afterwards, they started taking 
tours of the guys through th e camp, and then 
shortly after that, in July, the Division was 
disbanded, and we were preparing 
to go to  Japan to fight over there.
 

Q: So members of the Division were brought 
in.  When people grew up as prisoners in 
the camp, still in the camp ?  Where were they --
 
A: Yes.  This was in the period when they 
were trying to, not only 
bring up our medical 
staff and supplies, but ju st even wh ile the buria
l details were in progress so that the guys 
in the Division could see what's happening.  An
d this sort of reinforces what we'v e been 
fighting for, although, we didn't k n ow it. Fr
om Battle of the Bulge on, we were fighting 
mo st of the troops of a -- Panzer groups.  
Now the Panzer group was made up of several 
pounds or division, so it was 
a larg e -- almost a co
rps type thing. But 
we -- The people in 
these small town s, they said 
they didn't know anything about
 it.  I suspect they were 
telling the truth, but the people close to Ma
uthausen had to know what was going on.
 
Q: What happened to  the people that -- your 
part of the division regarding the Panzer 
groups?
 
A: When Mauthausen was cleared of the surv
ivors, and the dead  had been buried, our 
prisoners were transported back to Mautha
usen, and they were incarcerated in those 
barracks until they were later 
exchanged probably to the Ru
ssians, because they were 
supposed  to be turn ed over to the Russians 
anyway, and I suspect th
e Russians kept them 
for X number of years at forced labor. 
 I don't have -- that's a rumor I had.
 
Q: So th ousands of people in the 
Panzer group that you had to guard?
 
A: Yep.
 
Q: And then  they were moved to th e concentration camp s?
 
A: Uh-h m.
 
Q: How did your detail wind up from th
at part of the war, at Mauthausen?
 
A: See, the war was over shortly after that.  A
nd, in fact, the day we 
got the word that the 
war was over, there was a lot of celebration,
 you know?  And we 
got word  about 10:00 
o'clock in the morning.  And there was a lot 
of celebrating.  And th
en  about 11:00 o'clock 
at night we get an urgent message to mo
unt our tanks and move out, that 52 German 
Tiger Tanks were going to break through to
 a readout area in their purchase gard en, 
somewhere in that area.  And, 
so, we had to move from this little
 town we were in to head 
the tanks off.  And the German Tiger Tank 
is a huge tank, and greatly outguns, and 
there's much more armor than
 American Sherman Tank; th
ey had 88-milli
meter cannon, 
and we had a 76-millimeter.  An
d kind of against Tige
r, is not what we really  like to do, 
but we had to drive through 
the mountains to h
ead these guys off, 
but we had drunken 
drivers taking us there, and it was a blackout 
drive, so it was rath
er hazardous to your 
health just to ride the tanks.  But we got 
to where we were supposed to be, and the 
Germans didn't show up.  It was a trick or
 a rumor, that there were no Tiger Tanks 

coming through. But that was rea
lly the last incident of th
e war, as far as I remember, 
other than  going on guard duty in Star and 
Read, and eventually 
up to Nu remburg to 
supervise the destruction of German ammuniti
on by German POWs.  
And then I was able 
to go home, and didn 't really
-- end of December of '45, a
nd was actually discharged from 
the Army  in January  of '46.  And coming 
home, we were on victory ship, the Norw ay 
Victory, and it was a small boat, today's standa
rds, and we had a tremendous gale in the 
north  Atlantic.  Instead of taking seven days
 to go from Sibret to the Norfolk , it took us 
eleven.  And I was seasick ten-and-a-half of 
those 11 days.  It literally -- the waves were 
60 to  a hundred feet high.  I mean, you'd l
ook up, and the ship was down  here, and all 
you saw was water way up there.  But we di
d get to Norfolk safely
, and then we were 
discharged, and I used the GI 
bill to pick up a civilian lif
e, and it was a typical young 
man in a hurry.  I used the GI bill to get thr
ee degrees, and I -- including a master's and a 
doctorate, a Ph.D. from the Univer
sity of Chicago in 1950.  
So -- and then I went into 
community college work, and became th
e founding president of th ree community 
colleges in the country.  So I had a whole pr
ofessional career. But then 1976 -- oh, I had -
- when I got my Ph.D. in '50,
 Korea was breaking out, and in '52 it looked  like Korea was 
going to become World War III, a
nd I could see myself g o ing back into service as a tank 
crewman, PFC type.  And so  with a hot Ph .D. in
 my pocket, I went to various services to 
see if I could get a direct commi ssion. I went
 to the Army, and they
 said, We'd  make you 
a second lieutenant in  the quartermaster corps.
  I went to the Navy, and they  said, we 
have no use for Ph.D.s. Went to the Army -- or
 the Air Force rather, 
and they said, We'd  
make you a first lieutenant as a human resources
 research specialist. 
 I figured, with a title 
like that, it would take me -- well, it took me
 about 20 seconds to  accept the Reserve 
commission with the Air Force, 
and I stayed active in the Air Force Reserves. And in '76 
went back in active duty with the Air Force at
 the Pentagon.  I was a full colonel at this 
point, and became the director 
of post-secretary education fo
r the Secretary of Defense, 

and helped with the establishm
ent -- or rather with the degr
ee granting authority that the 
community college of the Air Force had.  So
 I was still in the co
mmunity  college wo rk.
 
Q: We're running out of time.  Going back to  
Mauthausen, were you able to take a tour 
through at the time --
 
A: No.
 
Q: -- after part of your division -- liberati
ng the camp , and cleaned part of it, you said 
other parts of your troop has passed 
through.  Had you gone through --
 
A: I wasn't part of that group.  I had gone ba
ck, as I said, five years ago.  That would 
have been '85, maybe '86.  Mo st of my  re
actions are from the film that Ray Bush had 
taken.
 
Q: Can tell me a little bit about how th at came about?
 

A: Well, Ray was with the '56 engineers, 
and he had a small ei
ght-millimeter camerA:  
And we were all told not to have that, came
ras or keep diaries or take pictures of 
anything, but that didn't stop mo st of us. 
And he was taking pict
ures of combat from 
England right in through the 
Bu lge on to Mauthausen.  And 
he would send those home.  
Some of them were x-rayed, unfortunately, bu
t he put them all together in this -- two 
reels of film, and he showed them to us at 
the division reunion.  And th e offhand, if I 

wanted a co py of it, he'd  be glad to do it, 
and I took him up on it. I had a copy made, or 
he had copy made, I paid for it, but wh ateve
r, and it was fortunate I did, because his copy 
was destroyed when  a fire went
 through his home. So  mine was the only surv iving co py, 

and that's why I thought, rather 
than take a chance on it, be
cause it is rather historic 
evidence that the Holocaust 
Museum should be -- would 
be the place to deposit it.
 
Q: And the film was taken as --
 
A: It took as day-to-d ay activities would pr
ovide. And I know one section of the film, 
there was a section of the 22nd Tank Battalion 
moving, and I think he got my  picture, but 
I was all buttoned up inside the tank. 
 He got a picture of my  tank anyhow.
 
Q: And it showed th e prisone
rs that survived as well?
 
A: Yes.  It was showing them in the barracks 
in various stages of emaciation.  It showed  

them unloading the dead in wagons, showed
 them placing them in the mass graves, 
showed them covering the graves, and even
 took a view from th
e concentration camp 
over to th e countryside where you could see the Danube River.
 
Q: And in your experiences of the war, was 
this something that was totally unexpected?
 
A: Yes.  We were fighting the Nazis.  We we
re soldiers fighting soldiers.  We didn't  Œ 
nothing prepared us for this.  
Nobody told us that 
there were concentration camp s.  I don't 
think anybody knew.  We didn
't expect anything when  we 
overran Mauthausen.  It just 
sort of reinforced the -- our
 feeling that we were fighti
ng a just war, that whatever 
happened, it was right that we 
should be in the war, that 
we were the good guys, white 
hats, even though there are ti
mes during co mb at when  we we
ren't nice guys, but comb at 
is like that, you 
fight to survive.
 
Q:  Okay . Thank you very mu ch .
 
A: Thank you fo r inviting me.
 
Conclusion of Interview
