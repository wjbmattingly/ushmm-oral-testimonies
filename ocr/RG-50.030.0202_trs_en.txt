Q:  Uh  what were the circumstances, do you kn
ow, of their getting to 
Le Cha mbon?   How did 
they reach it? 
 
A:  Uh in their  case t hey uh h
eard about Le Chambon 
fro m a fr i e nd, who 
sugge sted it t o  my 
fat her .  M y fat her ha d a  partic ularl y  uh hard 
t as k, beca use not only did he have t o find a  

place where they woul d be safe-- my mother bei n
g parti cularl y vul ner able as a forei gn Jew. 
And, of c our se, t he Fre nc h were
 focus i ng uh much of thei r coll
aborative efforts i n terms o f 
turni ng over Je ws on the forei gn Je ws .  So my
 mo ther was part icularl y vulnerable .  Uh, but  
in a dditi on she  ha d a  proble m pregnancy;  
and apparent ly t he onl y c ha nce she had of  
bringing the baby safely into 
the worl d wa s i f she had a s muc h
 peace a nd quiet and food as  
pos sibl e, which is  a bit of a 
t all order for  Nazi- occ upie d Europe .  Uh, a nd t his frie n d uh 
suggest ed Le Chambon.  He...he knew the pl ace; 
and my fat her went  there and found a room 
to rent, and uh went back
 to uh get my mo
ther.  And they ca
me on a little st
eam engine train  
that uh brought ma ny Je ws t her e, as we know
.  And uh...uh it was uh 
singularl y fortunate, 
beca use  I 'll uh...I 'll als o me n
tion t hat  uh t he doc t or who took
 care of my mother in Le 
Chambon was exactly for me the 
right doct or in the right pl ace .  Not only di d he ha ppen to 
be a  whi z of  a doct or who had trai ne d under Al
bert Schweitzer in Af
rica, deal ing wit h all 
sorts of proble ms and a ppar entl y ha d a re pu
tation as a bit of a me
dic a l genius , but in 
addition he was a a comm
itted Christian--one of 
the first uh of the ar
ea to be committed to  
non-vi olent resis...resi stance against the Nazi
s --a nd ha d a special st
a k e i n  my mot h er 's  
situation and this baby 
t hat s he wa nt ed to bri ng i nto t h
e worl d.  I don't t hink tha t uh she 
would ha ve gotte n better  me dical atte ntion i f I 
had been born i n the 
mo st mo der n A m erican  
fa cility today.

Q:  So you were, or your mother  was , bro
ught to this town in the apartment.  
Where ...whe re...the r oom that  your  pa rent
s  re nted, uh from whom 
di d t hey r ent it?  
 
A: They rented it from a peasant 
couple in a uh little 
hamlet which 
is a part of Le Chambon  
called La Fayoll e (ph).   Uh, I wa s known 
as the baby that used to wake up the 
neighborhood ea rly in t he morn
i ng.  Uh, t he y uh...uh, well  
as I mentioned in my film, 
" Weapons of the Spirit ,"  I...I ...my pa rents didn'
t r e main i n touch, a ctual ly, wit h the far mer s  
who re nte d t hat r oom.  But I tr
acked them down.  An d the wido
w of t he fa r mer who di d rent 
the room is in 
my film.  Uh... 
 

Q:  OK.  Wher e...where di d y
our  par ent s go a ft er t hat?  
 

A:  The y went t o uh Sai nt-Étie
nne for a year-- whic h is not fa
r from Le Cham
bon--where my  
father was a journalist.  My fath
er was alrea dy a jour nalist .   He had be en a journali st be for e  
the war.  And then to Paris. 
 

Q:  Let 's stay a mi nute [in] Sai nt-
Étienne for that year.  Uh, they
 we re i n  Le Ch
ambon, in the 
area of Le Chambo
n, for how long? 
 

A:  They wer e t here from t h e fall of
 1943 'til the end of the war. 
 I don't know ex
actly when they  
leave, come to t hink of 
it... when they left
, come to think of it.  Bu
t  it...I  thi nk i t  was  ar ound 
uh August of '44.  
Something like that. 
 

Q:  You t alk, obviously, a lo
t  about this  in your fi
l m.  Uh, but  for  t he pur pos
es of this interview, 
would you tell me more about th
e pe ople wit h whom your pa rent
s came i n cont
act, as they 

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202

told it to you?  You were, of 
c our s e, an infant .  And did t hey know your parent s wer e 
Je wish, and what
 t hat  meant? 
 
A:  (Pa use)  I 've  got to go a b out it ...  It 's co
mpli cated, because t here...there ar e presupposit i ons 
in t he que sti on t hat  I have to act uall y addr ess .  
That's  the uh...  I was 
not raised with stories 
about Le Cha mbon.  Uh, I wa s uh not raise d w
ith stories about the wa
r, with stories about  
the Hol oca us t.  I was r ais ed by pare nt s who want
ed to put all that behi
nd the m.  So, much of 
what I've come to know
 about Le Cha mbon--alt hough I 've 
since spoken quite
 a bit about my 
pare nts , a nd I 've  gotte n c ertainl y i n for mati on that 
i s rele va nt.  Uh, but  it 's
 not uh...a 
lot of my 
information is really inform
ati on t hat I  got a s a n adult, uh ta lki n g t o people . 
 

Q:  OK.   Th en  we 'll 
do this, as it were, 
at the end of the  interview ra
ther t ha n at  the begi nni ng. 
And l et 's tal k a bout uh...  And 
we'll talk about Le Ch
a mbon, a s s uch, at  th
e  end.  Uh tel l  me  
where your pare nts we nt .  They 
went  to Paris , you sai d.  Uh, what di d the y do ther e a nd for 
how l ong we re they there ? 
 

A: We ll, they were there 't il uh 
after the war.  They were 'til 
1948, when they
 came to New 
Yo rk .  Uh , my  fat h
er, a mong ot her things, edit e d a uh 
i ntell ectual  weekl y call ed " [La Rue 
(ph) ]," whic h wa s uh quite pr omine nt, had 
ve ry presti gious uh writer s-- uh, i ncl udi ng uh 
Sartre, Ca mus, and Raymond [Queno
t (ph) ]--a nd people li ke that c ontri buted arti cles t o it .  
But uh it was a very difficult ti
me to launch a...a publicatio
n and there wer e all sort s of 
restrictions, including paper restrictions.  An d uh
 ultimately it had to fo
ld after about ten or 
twel ve i ss ue s.  And uh my fat h
er uh had to fi nd wo
r k; a nd ulti mat ely he de cide d t o  go to 
Ameri ca, a n d we nt to New Yor k
 where he shortl y there a fter 
beca me t he corre sponde nt of 

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202

Le Fi garo--a French daily--which he wa s for tw
enty- five years.  Uh, 
[he was] also wr iting a 
number of books and 
also uh contributing to a numbe
r of ot he r public ations.   
 
Q:  Goi ng  b ack  t o Paris , 
uh by the time  you left  Paris or were
 about  to le ave  Pari s, you woul d be  
four  ye ars-- o r close  to it. 
 

A:  Ye s, ye s.  

 

Q:  Do  you reme mb er anythi
ng about  Par i s as  a  c hild?  
 

A:  Oh, I thi nk I have a fe w uh me
mori es t hat mus t  go bac k to that t i me .  But I 'm real ly st unned 
by how mu ch di ffic ulty I ha ve r e me mberi ng 
much of my childhood;
 a nd I  thi nk t hat  
probably has a lot to do
 with t he fact t hat I  was rai sed 
wit h me mory bei ng uh ba d.  Uh, I was  
discouraged fr om...from reme mb
ering.  I wa s di scouraged fr om
 as king questi ons.  And I  
think that's tampered with my 
ability to rememb
er.  And maybe that's 
what's given me a...a 
compelling need to
...to document preci
sely, because I don't trust 
memory.  Or maybe even 
to tell stories such as I do.  
Uh, so I remember
 uh startling little.  In 
fact, the most
 startling 
thing I...I've thought ab
out someti me s is that uh- -pa rticularl y I have a two and a hal f year old 
daught er now--a nd...a nd 
is t hat I realize I was four when
 I came to Amer
i ca, and I canno t  
until then...  Obviously, 
I did not speak English.
  And I cannot reme
mber ever...I cannot 
remember t h e experi ence of
 having been in a foreign land 
and not s pea king t he l angua ge.  I  
have absolutely no reco
llection of it.  And that
, t o me-- and...and I c a
n't imagine 
that that 
wasn't a traumati c experi ence, 
and I cannot connect w
ith it.  I cannot re
member it.  And I  
realize t hat four is alr ea dy not, you know, it
's not a baby anymore. 
 So uh I...I do vie w  
mysel f  as  a ...as a  pr oduct  of a  
uh...of a traumatized childhood.

Q: We ll, let's talk about that, 
and t alk more about t h at.  Uh, 
whe n you ca me to Ne w Yor k, uh 
wh at do you reme mb er ab
out  those  ye a rly, earl y yea rs a nd in Ne w York?  
 

A: Verylittle. 

 

Q:  Op po se dt o wh at
 you we re tol d?  
 

01: 10: 45 

 

A: Verylittle. 

 

Q: Verylittle? 

 

A: Very little, very little.  Uh, as 
I get older I reme mber more, of
 course.  But uh I...uh I think 
that t he fact that uh my parent
s withheld fr om me v
ital informa tion as to my identity-- as to 
wh o th ey we re, as t o wh y  we were t he r e, as 
t o u h wh y th ey we re w
ho t hey wer e--uh rea l l y  

uh confused all my ...all normal re
lationships withthe world.   
 

Q:  Who did you bel i eve your pa rent s were?   How 
did...  They were in 
Ne w Yo rk .  Yo u wer e  
wit h t he m.  You ha d no me mo
ry of before.  Did you be
li eve  you were  A m ericans?  
 

A:  No.  I kne w that uh...  No.  
In fact, I was raised 
very Fre nch.  Uh, t he 
uh...I...I now believe 
that part of the reason I wa
s raised so French was that 
it was a way of obliterating the 
Je wish.  Uh, I went to a  French s chool .  We
 spoke Fre nch at home
; alt hough I shouldn't  

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202

over state t hat, because there was also my...my 
mot her.  Eve n though she wa s origi nall y from 
Pol and had a great love of Fran
ce.  By the way, sh
e spoke Fr ench uh i mp eccably; and that  
had s o met hi ng to do wit h her s urvi v al duri ng t h
e war , too.  She was ab
l e successfull y to 
i mpers onate a Fre nc h woma n.  I ha
ve uh c o me fr om a fa mily wit h
 great linguistic skills.  Uh, 
my si ster l at er be ca me  a n act ress in Mexic o, 
uh playing Mexicans on 
t he scree n, you know. 
And as anyone who knows a bout 
acting knows, there's nothing mo
re difficult than that.  So 
it's...it's like, it's  fu nny how 
you see these things fo
llow through.  Uh  no, 
but we ...I didn't...I 
kne w we we ren't  Americ ans .  I kn
ew that we were ...we were  uh..
.  I n fact, i ntere stingly, uh 
although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I wa s Jewi
s h, we ...I al wa ys  kne w we we re di ffer ent .  We  
were foreign.  It's almost a way in which my
 par ents pre pare d me to...to then abs or b the  
truth.  I f the y ha d bee n people who compl ete
l y a ssi milat ed, I certainl y woul d ha ve been a  
di ffere nt per son.  The y never did.  Uh, j ust 
by r e mai ning Fre nch, by 
re ma ining di ffere nt, by 
not e ven be ing i m mi gra nts...my par ents , I...t he
y never r eall y ide nti fi
ed them[selve s] as 
i mmi gra nts .  I alwa ys ha d the fee ling in the b
ack of my mi nd t h at one
 day we would go back  
to Fr ance.  My fat her was a 
corres p ondent .  You know, t hat  
this was not nece ssaril y , you 
know, the...t he final mo
ve. I ne ver vie we d the m  as like pa
rt  of the , you know, i m mi grant  
fl ow into America. 
 Uh, very str ange. 
 

Q:  What  about  r eligion?  

 

A:  Uh, no reli gi on.  Uh I re me mb
er we ...uh I wa s what might be  
called a "nothing."  I n ot her  
words , whe n  I 'd a sk my pare nts ,
 " What...what  ar e we? ," t he y 'd
 say, "We're 
nothing."  And 
then t hey would move on; try t
o, you know, dis mi ss...dis mi ss t h
e questi on.  Uh, not long ago 
my si ster me ntioned, by t he wa
y, that  she was not  the onl y " n
othing" i n her  clas s.  Uh, you 
know, t here ...ther e ar e pe ople  who...who fi nd the m se
lves in... in that situ
ati on.  Uh, but no.

We  were  not...we wer e not Christi ans.  I neve
r a ssume d t hat , although
 it wa s c onfusi ng.  I  
gue ss I a ssume d that uh...  (Pau
se)  I guess I must have assume
d that we we re uh, you know,  
origi nall y Christia n; but my fat her was vi ole ntly
 anti-religious, as was 
my mother, in fact.  
And uh that  mea nt not hi
ng.  I me an, there wa s nothing Ch
ri s tian about  us.  Uh we were 
not hing. 
 
Q:  How di d i t  feel t o be a nothi ng, 
t o be of no reli gi
on and no place ? 
 

A: We ll, at the time uh I 
thought t hat was fine; or I . ..I t hough
t ...I thought that wa s fine.  Uh, 
I 've c o me t o fe el ver y di fferentl y about  that. 
 But that 's uh...I uh, 
you know, people oft en uh 
ask me --si nc e  I 've me ntioned t h
e fact t hat I onl y lea r ned I wa
s Jewi sh when I wa s ei ghte en--
uh, "How di d it...? "  And what ha ppe ned i s that 
my par ents sat  me down
 and tol d me.  I wa s  
about to go off to Pari s to st ud
y, a nd uh was  going t o be stay
i ng wi th a c o usin of mi ne , u h  
who ha ppens to be a sur vivor of Auschwitz . 
 To compound the irony, a r ather pr ominent  
gentlemen at that, 
Samuel [Pisar (ph)].  
And uh people will someti me
s say, "Well, was it a 
real shock?"  You know, "How di
d you react?"  And I.
..they'r e surpri sed th
at it --I don't  even 
remember exactl y how I  reacted. 
 And basical ly t he i n for mati on 
never really got t hrough t o  
me , but the facts got thr o ugh t o me .  But when yo
u are rai sed wit h taboos, the taboos ar e s o  
internalized that you don't full
y absorb the info rmation even
 when it is given to you. 
You...your...you
r filtering mechanisms ke
ep working.  Not only was 
I in the course of...of 
maintaining this...this lie abou
t who we were, part of what 
that entailed is that I wa s 
compl etel y cut off from al most all of my 
fa mil y.  Uh, it was a gr
eat...except fo r a fe w 
me mb er s wh o joi ne d in  t h
is conspiracy of not, 
of keeping the secret  fr
om the child
ren.  Uh, 
but uh it's still stu
nning to me to realize th
at my mother had aunt
s and uncles in...in New  
York whom I never kne w, beca us e they c oul dn't 
be count ed on to maint ai n the secret of our  

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202

being Jewish.  And now as
 I reconnect with those fa mily me
mbers, I still...there's a part of 
me that fi nds it very diff
icult to absorb their iden
tities and their names.  It
's like I...I'm...I still 
fe el this is informatio
n I'm not supposed to ha
ve , and I ha ve t o  fight t o t o have  it.   
 
Q:  Whe n did you start ...  Let 's keep goi ng with
 thi s.  Whe n... when yo
u went  uh to your...your  
relative uh Samuel [Pis
ar (ph)],  what was th
at like?  Did the info
rmation become a little 
more internalized for 
you?  What happened? 
 

A: No, it really didn't.  It really
 di dn't.  It took a long t i me .  An
d uh I wa s in Par i s ten year s, and  
I had no int e rest in...in a ny of 
thi s.  Uh...uh Sa m at 
the ti me wa s uh uh...( pause) li ke ma ny  
survi vors, uh concer ne
d wit h buildi ng his li fe ; and he 's 
a n a mbiti ous man.  And focusi ng 
on...on tha t , uh al th
ough he would he  woul d tell 
me stor ies .  I think t he...t he mai n e ffe ct of  
that was he ...he ...he...  Al though
 he doesn't really 
re me mber it, uh he...h
e did tell me stories 
about the camps and about his e
xpe ri ence s.  And uh they had a 
profound e f fe ct on me.  Uh 
but I still didn't really...I
 couldn't even...I'm not 
sure I could define what 
it was.  I...I still... 
No, I didn't uh...uh I ha
d  no J e wish  i dentit y wh en  I wa s in 
Par i s. None .  Uh, a nd no Je wis h  
involve me nt s.  And uh...uh I...t hat re ally only st a r ted...  The key infl uen
ce in my life, in that 
respect, was my wi fe--whom I 
married uh not long 
after I moved t o Lo
s  Angel es i n 1971--
who's a  uh Los Angel es native , uh uh very Je wi sh
 if one can speak in 
those terms, and very 
comfortabl e being Je wis h .  And 
uh who wor ked on me for ye a r
s and years and years .  And 
uh...and t he n  the  mo
st de cisive  influe nce of all wa s ulti matel y havi ng c hildren and re ali zing 
that I wanted them to
 have a very secure 
and comfortable sense of
 identity.  And uh we 
uh... my wi fe  wa nte d t o s e nd ou
r s on to a Re for m day sc hool, 
whi ch is where he goes no w 
and whe re he thri ve s.  And uh t hat ha
s had an influence on
 me as well.

Q:  As you be ga n to di scove r  your own i dentit y 
a nd who you we re, di d y
ou disc uss t his wit h  
your pare nts ? 
 
01: 20: 00 

 

A:  Ye s, we...we  ha d uh a number of
 disc ussi ons uh over t he ye ars.
  Uh, thi s was a very di fficul t  
subj ect for my fathe r .  My father di ed in uh 
Oct ober of 1988, not long 
be fore my fil m  on Le  
Chambon--"We apons of the Spirit"
-- was rel eased.  Alt hough he 
did se e it  uh be fore  he  die d,  
and t he whole process t h at I was i nvolved in
 wa s a very di fficult one for  hi m a nd a very  
scary one fo r him. 
 Uh, after all, he had 
built his whole pub
lic persona on not 
being Jewish.  
An d uh...and as a journalist this
 wa s, you know, sort of a co
mpounded ir ony.
  Not onl y was 
he a journali st, he was a good jour nal i st; and he
 was also a crusader 
for tr ut h and ha d be en 
all hi s li fe .  Uh, wit h t h is one big l i e in his 
l i fe.  And her e he had bre d, as t hese  thi ngs  

sometimes happen; this increa
singly public Jew - not only 
a Je w, but s o me body who was  
eve n insist ent on being quite public a bout it.  And uh I 'll ne ver  for get one day uh in t he early  

'80's, uh and I had this
 French film director who was vis
iting in L[os] A[ng
eles] and we had  
dinner or whatever . And I  talked about  mysel f, 
and just coi nci dentally 
h e  we nt t o Ne w York  
short l y t here a ft er a nd he  me t 
my fat her.  And uh in a ph
one conver sati on t he fol l owin g 
Sunda y, my father said, " Why 
did you s ay tha t  I..."-- that  my
 father--"was Jewish?"  I 
thought, " What...what was he ta lki n g about? "  
And I sai d, "I...I di dn't
 t alk about...I  don't  
eve n re me mber t alki ng a bout you."  And t he n he
 said, " Well ,  I met t his  director .  And he 
me ntione d..."  And t hen I realized I  had ta
lked about myself; but 
talking about mysel f 
expose d my fat her .  And I 'll ne ver for get that 
conversation.  Th is wa
s my...my dilemma, and  
it was in fact my di
lemma in making the film 
-  to prese r ve thei r privac
y, their right to have  
some c ont rol  over how t h ey le d 
their lives, which I basically 
believe was my obligation.  At

Q: It was quite a balancing act. 

 

A:  Ye s.  It wa s it was a v e r y di

 No w the fi l m itse l f wa

Interestingly, the film 
was very muc h ne got iate d wit h my pa

out cer tain t hings.  Whi ch I did; inc l udi ng thi

Uh, I 'll me nt ion one.  Uh  (pause

Uh the film was...the film was

Q:  Let 's hold it one s econd, if we c oul d...  (T

A:  The fil m wa s uh ne gotia t e d wit h my pare nts .  
They uh, for  insta nce , asked me to take out  
certai n thi ngs.  M y mot her...i n parti cular , my 
mother as ked me t o ta ke out very spe cifi c  
things.  And I reme
mber she asked me to take out three 
things.  And I thought about it; and I  
ended up...e nde d up ta ki ng out all thr ee.  And the y hurt .  And they hurt on various le vel s. I 'll  

mention one, because it was intere
sti ng the sort of di
lemma I was fa
ci ng.  Uh i n the fi l m, I  
initially...I...I re
ferred to my mother losing much of 
her fa mily, and I sh

my  mo ther  s urro un ded  b y
 her family.  And ori g
i nally I ha d na me d all  the de ad relati ves .  
And my mot her a ske d me to ta ke

thought that wa
s, I me an, the 
greate st honor I coul d do to thes e pe ople was t o 
na me the m, to give t h

grandmot her , Feige Sucholos ky.  
But I just decided, in that inst

my mother would take pr

took out  the names.

You know, it 's...it 's a mazing.  I

Q: We can come back to this later.  Uh, can 
you tell me ...  You've ta

relations wit h your fa mil y.  
I ha ve one mor e que stion about 
your pa rent s , and then we 'l l  
leave t hat phase.  Have
 you ma na ged through all 
t his to re mai n  close t o your pare nts , or has  
it se parat ed you i n s o me  wa y?  
 
A:  The r e wer e  t e nse  mo me n t s with  my  father , a s
 I was deve loping int o a pers on di ffer ent  fr om 
what he had antici pate d.  Uh my 
father ended up liking the film quite a bit, which is really in 
a...in a way t he str ongest endors
e ment  of the fil m I  ever had.  
Because wit h his mi nd- set, uh  
for hi m to say that the 
fil m wa s, you know, basi c ally c orre
ct, I thought, "My God, it really  
must be pret ty...prett y correct."
  Uh, he use d to ar
gue , though, that uh t he fil m-- and he 's  the  
only person who's ever said this 
to me, whic h is s ort of funny.  
But he al ways argued that the 
fil m would have bee n bet t er i f I  
ha d le ft mys e l f c o mpletel y out  of 
it.  Uh, but uh 
hard to say. 
We  ...we ne ver broke  rel ations e ver .  We woul
d have re gul ar  Sunday c onversa tions.  Uh, I  
don't ...  Let me put it thi s way. I hope that 
I wil l  have a cl ose r  relations hi p with my own  
children than I had with my pare
nt s.  I think that  uh people a r e punished for their si ns .  I 
think the way they raised me 
was wrong.  And I th
ink it impaired our 
ability to bond.   
 

Q:  Let 's go bac k a little bit .  I think that shou

, a l ong the  wa y--uh, agai n, for the rec o rd--I 'd li ke t o know a l itt le bit

 you di d as a 
young ma n.  
Wh at was your fa mily life  lik

 and friends.  It 's  ea sie r. 
 

A: I'll tell you, the most
 str i king thi ng a bout...a
bout my chi l dhood frie nds
 is that I realized a 
few year s ago that of my clos
est friends when I was a young 
c hild, uh a hi gh perce nta ge uh 
were if not children of 
Hol oc aust s urvi vor s-- al though ther e  wer e...t here  wer e...t here  wer e

some ...  I n fact, my
 cl osest friend for  a numbe
r of year s was .  Uh, at  lea st uh r elate d [t o the  
Holocaust] in the sense that so me of them, th
eir pare nts had come li ke in the '30's.  An d 
often those people don't 
identify as survivors, 
because they came ear
lier, even though they 
still lost a lot of their relatives. And often the 
effects are not efficien
tly...uh, sufficiently  
acknowledged as still bei
ng Holocaust-related effect
s.  Certainly, in te
rms of the children.  
Chi ldren al most never i denti fy as children of 
Holocaust survivors, if 
their parents came i n  
the mid- '30's .  Although often t h
ey have a lot more in common
 wit h chil dren of survi vors  
than they realize.  And this ..
.this  is all the more  striki ng si
nce I di dn't ...not onl y di d I not  
know I was the pare nts ...the c hil d...t he chi ld of
 Holocaust survivors, 
I didn't even know I  
wa s Je wis h.  So it 's funny that
 it was with these people that th
e relations hi ps uh de veloped. 
But I...I think that's  
just a measure of the inescapable 
commo nalities that...
that were there 
even though the labels
, you know, we ren't there. 
 I t was n 't  relat ions hips bas ed on la bels .  It  
wa s relati onships base d on, uh 
I gue ss, si milar at titude s or si m

A:  Uh, well , s o me stre ngt hs , some
 wea k ness es .  And uh I t hink uh
 what I a m most i nsist ent on-
-in fact , I 've been quite i n cendiary about it at 
ti me s --is tha t  uh we nee d to f i nd our own wa y 
towards thos e me mori es, our own pat hs, uh full y r e
spe ct ful of t he e xperi en
ce of our parents. 
Uh, ne edi ng to learn fr om it, n
eedi n g to hear the m, nee ding to 
hear that testi mony as much 
as everybo...everybody n
eeds t o hear  that testi mo ny; but at
 the same time , not to be...feel 
dwar fe d by i t , to ac knowledge 
our own childhood hurt
s, t o realize t hat i n some respect s uh 
we  ha ve  be en victi ms  of t he 
Holocaust in our own right, vi
cti ms of the effect  of the  
Hol oc aust  t hrough our pare nts , a nd uh some ti
me s our pa rents ha ve not bee n a b le to 
acknowle dge.  This  was  too pai n
ful to them, that such hurts 
occurred; and that often they--
unwillingly, unwitti
ngly, simply beca
use they went thro
ugh the experience 
that they went 
through--were the cause of some of this...t
his  pain.  Chi l dren of
 s u rvivors nee d to 
acknowledge that pain, need to 
acknowledge that need to...to 
form their ownidentities.  U h  
and that does involve, 
if they'r e interested 
i n psychology, I I belie ve  not hing i s more 
important than to be  able to 
get in touch with your ...your 
c hil dhood pains a nd a cknowle dge  
its existence and identify it.  
And that is the only 
way it will not be pass
ed on to your ow n 
children. 
 

Q:  In doing tha t , in at te mpt i ng t o rea ch yours
el f, as  it wer e, you ha ve , a mong other t hi ngs , 
chosen t o become a Jew.  Ho
w di d you a ctua lly...  You t a

 wi fe .  Bu t  
how...how does ...how di d tha t pr oce ss devel op,
 and how ha s that  inte
ract[ed]  with your 
pare nts?  
 

A: Thequestionof 
my Jewish identity is such
 an...my Jewish  identity 
is such an evolving one 
that it reall y cha nge s; not  only fr om year to 
ye ar, but proba bly from 
month t o mont h.  And I  
have no idea what exactly that
 identity will be uh fi ve years fr
om now.  Whethe
r it will be a 

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202 
16
 
 
very pronounced one, or 
whether I will decide enough of this
 and this really
 doesn't matter 
to me that much.  
I...I really don't ...I really
 don't know.  I know that 
uh I felt a need to have 
an ide ntit y, t hat the onl y 
identity that it ma de se
nse for me to have wa
s the identity of my  
ance stor s.  Uh, a nd that I have indeed bec o me 
incr easingly comfortable wi
th it, that I realize 
that a lot of who I am is inde
ed uh wrapped up in...in Judais
m and uh its i n flue nce s on my 
fa mi ly.  You know, t he infl uence.
..the influences exist 
whet her they're identi
fied or not.  The 
fa ct t hat  my pare nts uh never  
ac knowledged bei ng Je wis h does n'
t mean they weren't, in very 
funda me ntal  wa ys , very Je wish.  Uh, and uh a nd 
that influence was prob
abl y there.  Uh, but  
uh... ( Pa use )   You know, it 's i ntere st ing how th
e se thi ngs work.  I thi nk t he pe opl e of Le 
Cha mbon made me more  Je
wi sh.  They...  First of all, I came
 to believe that at bottom, when  
you've cut t h rough all t he speci fi cs of why they 
di d what they did or al l the  conje ctur e-- one  
can do all the fa ctors that come into this--
uh at bottom everything fl owed fr om their own 
inesc apa ble sens e of t he i r own i dent ity.  Th
eir own sense of comfor
t at being who t hey  
wer e, at ha ving no questions a bout who the y
 were .  And ever ythi ng fl owe d, a l most 
inesc apa bl y, incre dibl y naturall y and very sponta n
eously, from that.  That
 sense of identity. 
An d if one derived strength fr om that, that root
edness, uh well then I 
had to try t o a spir e --
partic ularl y as a pare nt, and wa nting to be abl e
 to raise str ong chil dren-- had t o aspir e to a 
si milar roote dne ss and ha d to find 
my roots .  And my r oot s we re 
in bei ng a  Jew, so that wa s  
the only way to go.  In additio
n, when I was maki
ng "Weapons of the Sp
irit," I realized that 
the wa y i n which the  fil m  woul d be
 most effective would be if it
 wa s a Je wi sh fil m in pr aise  
of a group of Christians.  It 
couldn't be a...a neutered film...w
ouldn't go anywhe
re.  And that 
force d me to ...to absor b and un
der sta nd a s much as I c oul d, t o..
.t o real ly be a s Je wi sh as I  
coul d be in t he maki ng of tha t  fil m.  But t hat it
's ...it had to mir ror, in a way, the...t he re union 
that took pl a ce in Le Cha mbon bet we en Je ws a nd 
Christians, that it had 
to e mb...e m
body it. 
As best as I could, as ignorant as I am still abou
t so much of Judaism, it 
had to be uh Jewish.

And I 'm ve r y touc he d, by the way, when uh or
t hodox J e ws are responsi ve to the fil m, a s  
indeed the fe w who have spok
e n t o me have  been.  Uh
, that me ans a l ot to me. 
 
Q:  How do your par ent s re a ct to your  be
ing Jewish, openly an
d publicly J ewish? 
 

A:  My fat her was ver y unc o mfor
table with it.  My mo
ther, particularly si
nce my father passed 
awa y, has uh really jetti soned a l ot of t he pa st 
taboos.  In fact, s he 's proba bl y made c ha n ges  
faster t han I 've been abl e  to accept  her change
s.  Uh, t hat ofte n ha pp
ens that way.  Uh, I'm 
al most  loc ke d int o my i m age of her; a nd she  pr ob
ably i s far readier t o 
change than than I am 
ready to ac c ept her cha n ges .  So she  really, 
I I must sa y, now i s...i s...s e e ms to be quite 
comfortable with all of this uh
...and uh loves the film.  Has a 
tape of it which she looks at  
periodically, and uh very, very supporti
ve a nd uh uh uh...and 
uh apparently quit e  
comfortabl e wit h all  of it . 
 

Q:  You ha d me ntioned...  And now
 let's move more to the film 
its elf.  Uh, you had me ntioned  
that ther e were three s e gment s that you had 
le ft  out.  You had descri be d one .  Ca n you 
descr i be  the other  t wo?  
 

A:  It's funny.  Somebody aske
d me t hat  a while back
.  And I...I wa s a fr a
id when I me nti o ned  
that t hat you were goi ng to as
k me  t h at questi on, beca use  uh 
I tried to reme
mber  what  the 
three wer e the ot her day and I c oul dn't .  I 
reme mb ered two of them, and I was mi ssing a 
third.  I...I know I'm going to 
be able to to...  One wa s th

relatives.  The ot her one wa s 
the uh place they wer e from
--Bialystok, Poland. Uh, the 
original narration said my mo
ther 's  fa mil y in...in Bia l yst o
k; and...and...and I took out  

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202

Bial yst ok because I  was asked to
.  And it's the third request th
at, at this point, I cannot 
re me mb er.   
 
Q: Uh, let's talk a bit 
now a bout the  ma king of..
.of "Weapons of the Spir
it."  Wh at kind...when 
you starte d t o...t o uh do t he pe rsonal i ntervi e ws
, c an you tell me some
t hing about t he peopl e  
who...who woul d ha ve be en
 the most i mporta nt?   Uh, cert ainl y  to your pare nts, e ve n i f they  
didn't want to talk about it. 
 Uh, for i nsta nce , uh Magda Tr

A:  She's an extraordinary woman. 

 

Q:  Ca n you des cribe  your  re lationshi p wi th he
r, and what she is lik

01: 42: 00 

 

A:  It 's funny. I ' m ju
st move d thinking a bout Magda .   I love
 her .   I love her .   Uh, she i s  an 
extraordi nar y woman, extraordi nary woman.  U
h...  ( Pause)   If I 
ma y, I 'm...I 'm te mpte d  
to...t o int erje ct real qui ckl y that
 we really live in a sexist soci

when it c o mes t o re sc uer s, uh 
I 'm c o nvi nce d t hat  wome n pla yed

tends to focus--when...when it
's talking about leadership--
on Pa stor  Tr oc mé , who wa s a n e xtra ordi nar y figu

brilliant, brilliant man.  
Uh, but really, that...t
hat combination of Past
or Trocmé and Magda 

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202

Trocmé was an extr aor di nary co mb

pers on I ha ve ever known.  Uh, s he uh...  
(Pause)  She cuts thr o
ugh to things.  Uh, 
im...immediately.  
She i s an extraor dinar y, extraordi nar
y, ext raordinari l y practi cal per son. 
Uh, she reall y...  You 
know, Tr oc mé --Pa stor Tr oc mé-- was a ...
a thinker.  Uh, some of that 
thinking ended up producing tre mendous res ults
;  and he would...he 
did things.  But  uh 
Magda Tr oc mé  is  trul y a...a  do
er.  Yo u know, "What do you ne
ed now?  What
 has to be 
done now? "  You know, "How are you goi ng t o s olve 
that problem? "  It...i
t...  All practical.  
And uh I...I ...I r eall y s or t  of 
absorbed from her the sense in which that  is what  is most 
i mport ant in any given s ituati on, in any situatio
n of crisis .  Don't ma ke a big de al about it . 
Just , you know, figure out, you know, wh
at nee ds  to be done  a nd do it .   
 

Q:  And that  came through in the film. 

 

A:  She  is ...s he i s a ...a uh...s he 
is a...a extr aordi nar y woman.   

 

Q:  In the fil m, one of the t hings
 that you do is t o develop an
 underst anding that events took 
place  not onl y i n Le Cha mbon but  
in all the surrou

A:  You know it 's a very i mp ortant poi nt, a very i m

obs cure d thi ngs e ven i n...in the fil m.  You kn
ow, fil ms a r e not  footnote d.  Uh, the y...t hey 
have to be  some what li near 
- the form has certain
 r equire me nts .  And to be  sur e, Le  
Chambon was the cent er piece of wh
at occurred.  I t was where 
Past or Trocmé and Assi stant  
Past or [Édouard] Thei s a nd M agda Tr oc mé wer e a t
 the heart of  what di d occur.  Uh, and the 
railway st ati on was i n Le Cha mbon.  But r eall y
 what...whe n it 's talki ng a bout ...a nd you tal k  
to Jews who were i n the area, 
they ar e talki ng about t he area
.  They are talking about "Le 
Plate au"
1
.  They are tal k ing about al l the surr ou
ndi ng ha ml e t s, and inde ed some of the 
neighboring villages.  Uh, what
 happened is symb
ols get created, and Le Chambon is the  
symbol.  Le Cha mb
on i n esca pabl y wi ll be the s y mbol .  Bu
t I hope t hat soon enough we  will  
be able, having absorbed the sy
mbol--the symbol having become sufficiently fa miliar to us--
we will then be able to realize 
and acknowledge that it is merely 
a symbol.  And, 
in fact, it's  
a symbol for the area. 
 And in Le Cha mbon it
s elf, there is very muc h t hat c onc ern.  Le 
Chambon itself doesn't want it to
 appear that it is trumpeting it
sel f in any wa y, parti cularly 
Le Cha mbon vers us Le Mazet or ve rsus Fay.  You know, t h ere wer e pas t ors in all those  
areas who were activel y i nvolved 
i n  wh at we nt o n.  Uh
, and for posterity it is certainly, it is 
crucia lly i m porta nt that  t hat poi nt be  ma de .  In
 fact, it  amazes me t h
e point is made in the 
film...  You know, it...it...it...I
 thought it was made quite str
ongly in t he  fil m, about  that  
surr oundi ng area was involved.  
And it al most amazed me how 
uh ever y reviewer  ignores 
that and s ays  Le  Cha mbon, and ta
l ks , you know.  And I  sa y fi ve
 thousand Christians in the  
area, but it it  oft en becomes the 
fi ve  thousand vil l ager s of Le 
Ch ambon.  People have great  
difficulty fo cusing on 
what, to them, ar e detai ls.  Uh, 
but certainly for history [it] is 
i mport ant  to...t o unders core.  
Yes , i t was...it  was  the are a.

think of individuals, it's
 hard for me to...t o thin

of some of t he pe opl e...  Well
, pr oba bly, the people in Le Cha mbon t hat  I proba bl y fe el  
close st to, beside s uh...beside s the Troc mé fa m
i l y, uh are uh He nri et
 Anne Heri tier  (ph) , 
who pla y a  very i mp...ve
ry important role in the film, uh
 who open and close the film, but  
wh o...who also...  And pl
ayed a very important role in the 
life of the vill
age, uh although 
nobody kne w it at  the t i me; bec ause they were 
ha rbori ng t he young J e
w who wa s the f orger 
for the vill age.  And t h at wa
s a key component in what went
 on there.  People--Jews--
nee ded false ...fals e I D 's .  Uh, but t h ey pl aye d
 an important role in my life , beca use my 
parents had a very surprisingly 
close relationship with Heritiers
.  They did not have a close  
relationship with the peasants wi
th whom they we re staying.  
Uh, a nd didn't...mai ntai ne d no  
contact with ...with them
.  Whereas t h e Heriti ers, they did 
maintain a contact.
  Whe n  I  we nt

and uh sai d hello to t he m.  
An d my...my parents always thou

That's right.  I was

wh o was uh...went with my pare

a  big deal for the Heriti ers .  Their  da ughter

beca use t he y ...the y truste d my pa

Heritier mentions the fact that
 that's where I learned to

 And, you know, it wa s

A:  Ye s.  

 

Q: Tell me how th
at  vi sit i n t he '60's came about, 
and what your pa
rents  tol d you. 
 

A:  That  vi sit was a part of my uh peri od i n 
the desert, so to speak,
 uh where I ...I was a 
traumati zed young ma n who didn't 
know anythi ng.  So 
that is ...it 's  e ns hroude d i n t he  sa me  
sort of uh mystery that much of 
my early life is.  I.
..I...and I remember 
very little about it.  
All I kn e w wa s tha t  we wer e  g o

didn't know wh y they were there. 
 I didn't ask.  I had bee n taught not to a sk que stions .  I wa s 
a ver y good, duti ful  chi l d, w
ho didn't ask quest i ons .  Uh, 
a nd uh I  was  brought t o the

none of this had  
any context, and uh really infl ue

Q:  How ol d wer e  at  that  ti me ? 

 

A:  I 'm not sure of the exact

uh...twent y- one , t w ent y-t wo. 
 

Q:  And your parents never t old

 you were goi ng to visit a place t hey had

A:  No .I n . . .  

 

Q:  Not  t hat pe ople r esc ue d t he m, or  none  of that?  

 

A:  No.  Of c ourse, int eres t i ngl y, uh it shows 
how t aboos linger  on long a ft er they've been 
ostensibly lifted.  This was a 
ti me  wh e n I alread y k ne w I wa s Je wis h an d the y wer e  Je wis h.  
But it was nevertheless a time when
 I still didn't push, didn't...  
My parents, probably at that 
ti me  they...t hey ha d i mp arted the  infor mati on, but
 they didn't want it to
 matter to me.  They 
still didn't want me to ask questions
.  They still didn't want to...  So I...
I...I still never asked 
que stions .  Uh, " H ow di d you su
rvive?  Where...?"  Yo u know
.  And uh, you know, I didn't  
uh...and I  di dn't re alize  t he...t he
 ext e nt of what had happe ned

uh I...I re all y don't re me mber that ...t hat vis

much better ,  and I wil l  share wit h you, uh a vi

the earl y '80's, a nd we knocke
d on the  door .  You kno
w, in a small village you don't al wa ys 
call a hea d.  You know, you
 just drop by.  An d 
we  di d.  And I i ntroduce d Bar bara , my wi fe , 
to...to the Heritiers.  
And uh Madame Heritier 
immediately left and we
nt into another room, 
and ca me  ba ck wit h thi s bea uti ful  fra me d phot
ogr a ph of me  as  a ba by. 
 And it 's s o met h ing I  
will never rememb
er.  It was so touching
 that she had that phot
ograph, and that she knew 
i mme diat ely, you know, where  it wa s .  That it ha
d been in some  very accessible place that 
she  could bri ng it out  so 
quic kly.  And uh uh...I 
uh...I  do fe el a ve ry, 
very, ver y spe cial  bond  
with...with those people
 and with that community.  Free 
a ssoci ation here, but  I...I  just  
thought of.  I've never mentione
d this, really.  But 
a line that will be fo
rever with me which  
wa s so t ypi c ally Cha mbonais , in a way.  A
not her  wonder ful woma n 
who was in the film 
wa s Ma da me Barea u (ph), who wa
s  a ver y old woma n eve n  then
 when I interviewed her. 
And uh i n fa ct, the pr ob
l e m I ha d a s the fil m ma ker was pinn
i ng her down and 
to sit fo r the 
interview, because she 
was al ways running ar ou
nd.  And as she woul d 
descri be it, she was 
always running around visiting 
the old people.  Uh, and she be ing uh already 89.  Uh, but I 
re me mber I had borrowe d all her...he r phot ogr aphs
; and all the se people entruste d me wit h  
all their photographs, and even their  chil dhoo
d photographs .  Which is
 ...  They re ally 
truste d me.  And I re me mber ..
.I 'l l  never forget uh goi ng to her house to ret urn he r  
photographs , and she  ope n
ed the door .  And I wa
s thanking her , a nd s he wa s a nxi ous  t o say  
something to me.  An
d uh s he int e rr upte d me, a nd s he sa
i d, "You know, I was tal king to 
Madame Caritienne (ph)...
"--another person.  And she said, "I just wanted you to know that 
we bot h agre ed it would have be
en a sha me i f you hadn't bee n bor n."-- "S'a urait do mage que  
vous ne s oye z né."  And I've t hought a bout line s o
 often.  It...it 's  so typi cally Cha mbona is, in 
a way.  Because, of co
urs e, it woul d be a s ha me i f ...i f anyb
ody wa sn't born.  Bu t it was both 
very, very personal and very, very broad.  I s
till don't even know what 
the line means.  All I 
know is  uh it  sparke d me, it 's  part of me.

Q:  What  would you li ke t o 
a dd for  the purpos es  of th
i s fil m we ha ve done  ?  
 

02: 00: 30 

 

A:  We ll, I 'd li ke to s a y s o methi ng about ri ght
eous Christians, such 
as the people of Le 
Chambon, to which I am incr eas
ingly devoting part of my  life
.  And perhaps 
particularly  
this:  as we come to 
attach more i mportance to
 them, and we are doing 
t hat , we  must not  fal l  
into a tr ap.  The old tr ap use d 
to be to dismiss them, to ignore 
them, to consider
 that all this 
wa s so uh...t hey wer e  so
 fe w in number that they'r e not impo
rt ant. Because th
ey wer e  fe w in  
number.  And, of c our se, they 
were few i n numb er.  But that
's pre c isel y what ma kes the m  
important.  Uh, and th
at somehow focusing 
on them will whitewas
h that period, that 
some how it will ma ke...give the worl d an excuse to
 feel bett er  about it sel f.  Well, t hat 's not  
the way it works.  On the co
ntrar y, they ma ke us acc ountable . They prove tha t  it was  
pos sibl e t o c are.  And t h at is  what  is  nec ess
ary.  If we hand on onl y a me mory of...of...of  
bitterness and hopelessness, then
 the world is off the hook.  
If the world ends up thinking  
that it  is not pos sibl e to c o mbat
 evi l , t hat it is not pos sibl e to 
st and up, t he n...t hen it 's off  the  
hook.  The n  it 's not  poss ible t o do a n ythi ng.  
So t hat t hat...all those 
things we will quickly 
come t o underst and.  But t he ...the ...the tr ap
 is  that we not, in focus i ng on t he m, star t  
idealiz ing the m.  That we not put t he m on pedest
als.  That we  not ma ke heros of the m .  Of 
cour se, t he y  appe ar to us unusual beca use t he y weren't ma ny a nd t here 's s o met hing 

inesc apa bl y movi ng about the m.  But it is crucial  
that we take their word for it, that what 
they did came naturally to
 them.  It was normal.  It was no 
big deal .   That t hese people are 
no di ffere nt from us .  Tha t  wha t  the y did is...w
e ar e capable of doing.  Uh, t h at uh they acted 
out of emotions and attit
udes that were not heroic, larger than life uh
...you know, emotions;  

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202 
27
 
 
but j ust ver y  s mall nor mal e moti ons.  Uh, t here  
were...t here were hero-t ypes als o duri n g the  
Hol oc a ust .  The r e were people li ke Ra oul Wa
lle nber g or Andre Troc mé .  The se wer e people  
who had a ...a co mpelli ng nee d to ma ke t heir 
mar k, t o...t o...  These were her os .  Most  
rescuers of Jews during 
t he Holoc aus t were not  that sort.  
The y were  ve ry ordi nar y people ,  
who s i mpl y responded a ppr opri ately
 to the challenge that they 
faced.  And they are t he most  
releva nt to us.  Ver y fe w of us are goi ng to 
be Ra oul Walle nber gs.  Al l of us , ever y da y, are  
faced wit h choices that i nvolve re
cognizing that t here is a need to help, uh a need not to turn 
away, a need to realize that we are responsibl
e for somet hing that is goi ng on around us.  
That  we can infl uence positi vely
.  And we need t o know-- in a  
way, in the most selfish...for 
the most selfish reasons--that re
sponding to that need
 will make us feel 
good, will make us 
fe el uh peaceful, happy, uh 
will prolong our 
lives.  Uh to care 
about other people is 
fundamentally to care about yourself.  And that is part of
 what I hope uh 
people will derive 
fr om c onta c t  wit h...t hrough museums, throu
gh books, thr ough fil ms,
 will deri ve  fr om 
learning about the right
eous gentiles of the Ho
locaust.  And the ri
ghteous Jews of the 
Holocaust.  Because they existed, too.

Q:  OK.  One of the questions I'
d like to ask is...does concern ma
king " We a pons of the Spi r it." 
Uh , can you tell us why you made it? 
 Ho w you came  about to ma ke it? 
 

A:  I think it is no coi nci de nce that s o me body 
who wa s raise d  to for get e nde d up ma king a  
doc ume ntar y  recor d of what ha ppene d in Le
 Cha mbon.  I thi nk that uh maybe pe opl e who 

USHMM  Archi ves  RG- 50.030*202 
28
 
 
are raised with stories all thei
r lives someti mes take them fo
r  gr ante d.  Uh, peopl e who tr us t  
their me mo ry often have ma ybe less of a ne
ed to docume nt.  Because I have such a 
precarious memory, b
ecause it 's such a chall enge for me 
to...to...t o re me mb er
 things, I only 
feel secure if it's in some way recorded.  To 
me, it only exists when 
it 's recorded.  And uh I 
think that may have  be e n a big 
part of this comp ulsive need 
t o docume nt uh t he s t or y of Le  
Cha mbon a nd-- f orgi ve  me  for  sa yi ng so, but-
- t o rea lly docume nt it a s acc urat ely as I  
pos sibl y c ould.  You ca nnot foot not e a fil m, but
 I l ove  hi st ory.  Uh, I love  ac ade mic

i s to be as uh accurat e as it po
s sibly could be; beari ng i n mind  
that any fil m has to ha ve a dra mati c fl ow
, e ven a doc ument ary.  
So, you know, you...yo u 
tell; but at t h e sa me ti me- - and t hat wa s part of 
the reason that it took so long and was suc h a 
challenge, in terms of put ting it 
together--to both respect the hi st
ory, respect all the detail s, 
have ever y detail right, and yet not have it be
 bori n g.  Whic h was my pri ma r y obli gati on as a  
fil m ma ker .  It had to...the fil m had t o work
.  I think that uh my tra u mat ized upbri nging  
probabl y ha d a lot to do with my  need t o 
tel l  the stor y, and pr oba bly had a l ot to 
do...certa inl y  had a l ot to do with
 t he effect that the people of
 Le Cha mbon had on me .  Uh, 
you know, the amazing thin
g to me, as I've come to refl ect
 on this a little
 bit , about  the  
influe nc e of the stor y of Le Cha m
bon on my life is that it rea
lly uh...it happene
d t wic e.  It 
happe ned at my birt h; but it happe ne d whe n 
I was an adult and I ca
me ba ck there and met  
these people again, and was so 
heavily influenced by them that
 it really changed my life. 
And I r eally feel that 
they resc ued me  tw
ice.  And perhaps it is th
at second f or m of rescue--
the rescue of me as a l ost, 
rootles s, depr ess ed a dult--t hat 
gi ves " Wea pons of the Spirit "  
somet hing of a uni vers al  me ssa ge.  Bec ause I do
 beli eve t ha t  ma ny of us , eve n though my 

case may have been exte
me, that many of us do have a need
 for positive stories to hold on  
to.  Le giti ma te, re al re alis tic sourc es of hope .
