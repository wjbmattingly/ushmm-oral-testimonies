July 8 & August 17, 1999 
Tape 1, Side A 
 
[Copy-checked and partially authenticated by A.D. --9/20/05] 
 
 

Q: –Just test your voice too, so 
we can get the levels right.  
So, are you planning on watching the 
game  on Sat urday, the World Cup game ?  
 

A: Yes, I think I™m going to take a look, because 
I want to know how they do compared to the other 
people.   
 

Q: Are you rooting for the U.S., or China? 

 

A: Well, I think I would like to see Ch
ina win.  I like th
e acupuncture idea. 
 

Q: Ah, yes, yes.  Okay, this is a United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Paul 
Pressman.  It™s July the eighth, 
1999 and we are sitting in Dr. Pr
essman™s home and office in 

Lexington, Kentucky, and this is Ar
wen Donahue conducting the interview.  This is tape number 
one, side A.  Let™s begin then 
with, would you tell me  some thing 
about your, well first of all, 
let™s begin with where you were 
born and your date of birth. 
 

A: I was born in Paris, France, May 29, 1932.  I did 
my school in France, my me dical school, also.  
And I stay until the fi rst World War and when th
e German came.  And by the time probably I 
was around nine years old, and the Germans start 
to come  in the school, but first it was the 
French police who came, just aski ng every teacher
, ﬁDo you have any Jewi sh boy in the school?ﬂ  
And she said or he said, ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ  So th
ey ask, ﬁWho is Jewish, raise your hand.ﬂ  And I 
didn™t raise my hand and when I did go back home, I 
said to my mother and father, well, this is 
what happene d.  And they sent me  in a safe place in South of France. 
 

Q: How did you know not to raise your hand?   What ma de you not do that? 

 

A: I think it was personal instin
ct.  I thought, you know, you can as
k, ﬁAre you French?   Would you 
like to stay and live in France
? ﬂ   But the question ﬁAre you Je
wish?ﬂ was a little bit surprising 
for me .  Wh y should people ask what kind of re
ligion, mostly we knew it was the police.  So, I 
didn™t feel comfortable, so I sa
id, I™m going to wait a little bit 
and speak to my parent and ask 
them what they think. 
 

Q: Had you been aware at all at th
at time, that there was any danger 
to Jews posed by the Germans?    
 

A: Oh yes, I, in Paris, they start to prepare a bi
g place, to put a lot of pe
ople, belonging to a certain 
religion, so I knew some thing wa
s going on, but , you know, at my age, when I was nine or ten 
years old, it is not, it™s not like 
a game , but it™s not very serious. 
 But I knew they™d been taki ng 
Jew in other country.

Q: What was your name  at birth? 

 

A: The same  na me  I got now, Paul
 Pressman, P R E  S S M A N.    
 

Q: Do you know anything about the name  Pressma n
?   Is that where your family ca me  fr om? 
 

A: Mine parent are both born in, 
at the time it was Romania.  It wa
s Romania, became Russian, then 
became Romania.  And all of my family, I don™t 
know any of them, but c o me from Romania.  
The name  of the town is Kishinev, Bessarabia. 
 

Q: When did they come  to France, to Pa ris?  

 

A: They got ma rried in Romania and they came, 
I reme mber my father sayi ng, at the time they 
arrive  in France, my mother was sixteen or seve nt
een.  And they try first to come  in United State, 
but they didn™t let them in United State, because 
my mother did have glau
coma .  And they didn™t 
know what was glaucoma  at the time .  They thought
 it was a very dangerous sickness, so she did 
go back to England, stay in England a little while 
and establish in Paris, Fr ance.  And this is 

where I was born. 
 

Q: What was your, what we
re your parents™ name s? 
 

A: My mother is Pauline Kogan, K O J A N
1
 and my  father was Joseph Pressman. 
 

Q: And did you have brot
hers or sisters?   
 
A: I did have three brother.  I™m
 the youngest one.  The other brother,
 both of them did work with 
my father in a drapery factory he did open.  
The other one, at the time didn™t work, he was 
young.  And I was the sma
llest, the little one. 
 
Q: What were your, what was your oldest 
brother and your mi ddle
 brother™s name s?  
 

A: The oldest brother, who survived the Holocaust
, name  is Bernard and the other one, who died in 
Auschwitz was Maurice.  The other one, 
the third one is Gaston, and I am Paul. 
 

Q: And Gaston survived as well? 

 

A: Yes, because  he was sent  with me  in a safe town, south of France, because at the time France 
was cut in two parts, north and south.  And the s
outh was with the Italian and it was much easier 

there.  It didn™t stay long, but 
by the time  the Italian were there, it was much easier than in north, 
where the Germans were much more rough with us. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther work?

A: Before the war, yes, she was working with 
my father.  She was working a sewing ma chine in 
Havre 
(ph )
, in the business of my fat her.  And un
til the end, she was working with him.   
 
Q: And she stopped when the war began? 

 

A: Well, she stopped when the French police, under
 the order of the German came to pick up my 
two brother.  And my two brother did follow 
the police with no resistance, because they, you 

know, the police said it is just to ma ke a verifica
tion of your paper.  And they didn™t ask anything 
about my fat her, but he right away closed the 
whole thing.  And we had been waiting about the 
answer, but my two brother never came  back.   
 

Q: Can you just tell me  something about your 
childhood, your home?   What
 stands out in your 
me mory fr om that time? 
 

A: Well, we used to have a nice apartment in Pari
s, close to the business of
 my father.  And also 
about fifteen miles from Paris, we
 did have a little villa, where we used to go on Saturday and 
Sunday and stay there.  Life was very simple, 
happy, didn™t have any ma jor problem.   They used 
to work during the week.  I used to go to school. 
 Saturday– Friday night, we load the car, we 
did go and st ay outsi de of Paris.  And everyt
hi ng was fine and dandy.  So, life was norma l, until 
the whole German story start and th
en everything change overnight. 
 

Q: Were your parents religious
 at all?   Your fa mily? 
 

A: My mother was very religious, but my father wa
s not religious at all.  So, he ask me  one day, I 
reme mber, he said, ﬁDo you want 
to do your Bar Mitzvah? ﬂ  And I 
said, ﬁNo, I don™t want to.ﬂ  
Okay, no Bar Mitzvah.  And it was the end of the 
story.  My brothers ne
ver did a Bar Mitzvah.  
He was really not very interested
 in, not only in the Jewish religi
on, but on any religion.  This is, 
I think, the way I am now.  [Laughi ng]   
 

Q: Was it hard for your mot her that you, that 
you and your brothers were
n™t being raised more 
religious? 
 

A: I think so.  I think it was hard
 for her and this is why she asked 
us, the day she™s going to die, she 
wants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which 
we did.  At the time, I did have an office in 
south of France, close to Nice.  And when she 
died, we ma de... the rabb
i did the whole thing.  
We didn™t understand anything about 
it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did.  But here 
she is in sout h of France, in a Jewish place, 
where she was buried like the Jewish religion.   
 

Q: Do you remember... I assume  you, were you going to a public school? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember when the Germans occupied Fr ance?   Do you reme mbe r  them comi ng in? 

 

A: In France?  They came very, not
 in force.  They came very, very slowly.  The reason, I think, 
they got the whole thing so easy is because the Fr
ench people are very anti-Semitic.  So, for them 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

4
to give the address or to re
veal where the Jew were living, 
it was not a problem.  And I don™t 
mean to say all of them, because a lot of po
lice... we did have a ne
ighbor, across from our 
apartment, who was from the police.  And I even reme mber his name .  His name  was  Mr. 
Reddler 
(ph)
.  And every time some thing did happen, he came in our door, knock on the door 
and said, ﬁBe careful.  They™re going to do this, 
they™re going to do this.ﬂ  So, I don™t mean to 
say all the Fr enchmen, but I said at least the ma
jority of the French people were anti-Semitic. 
 

Q: Did you have any sense, up to that point, of
 being a Jew?   Had you pe
rsonally experienced any 
anti-Semitism?  
 

A: All the time, even when I wa
s a little boy I took the subway in
 Paris and you can see on the wall, 
Jew equal concentration camp, Jew go home , thi
ngs like this.  Yes, you couldn™t do otherwise 
than to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our
 own country.  When I say our own country, I™m 
born in France, so I thought I was a Frenchma n, which was a big mi stake, because no.  I was a 

Jew.  It™s a little bit the same  pr
oblem and I don™t want to start any– 
 

Q: It™sokay. 

 

A: It™s the, my feeling– I speak with a lot of
 black people here and I 
ask them why do you call 
yourself, African-Ame rican?  
 I don™t say to people, I am a French-Ame rican.  I™m an American, 

because I asked to become an American.  If I 
would call my self French-Ame rican, it would me an 
to say, I™m very happy to be French and I™m also 
happy to be an American.  And I think in life, 
you have to ma ke a choice, either you are an Am
erican or you™re Fren
ch.  And if it wouldn™t 
be– I say this the other day to a black guy.  He
 was very surprised.  And comi ng from me , I 

think it was not a big problem.  But I said, ﬁI
 think you™re very luc
ky, your grand-grandparent 
was brought in United State.  At least now you 
can drive a car.  You can have a nice home , 
instead of being in Africa where you™d be star
ving.  You wouldn™t have any clothes to put on 
your back and anybody can kill you.  And this for me  
is racism.  Here racism is not this.  They 
are not racist, so I don™t unders
tand why you call yourself
 African-Ame rican.  You are American 
from two, three or four ge nerations.  And it™s not
 because your parent s were slave.ﬂ  And when 
you know the story about the slave,
 it™s not the American who t
ook the black people.  It™s the 
chief of the village, who give bl
ack people to the American.  So– 
 

Q: What kind of response did you get? 

 

A: Most of the time they said, ﬁ W
ell it™s a way of things.  You have a different way of speaking.ﬂ  
And I said, ﬁYou know, I, as a Jewish person cannot 
be a racist.  So, if I tell you this, it™s because 
comi ng from another country, I™m surprised the wa
y you deal with your slave story.  You feel 

sorry for yourself, but you™re 
so lucky to be in a country where you have freedom and you can 
live like any other person.  You
™re Black?   Sure it™s, you can s
ee a black man, but someti mes you 
can recognize a Jewish boy and so it™s nothing wors
e to be Black or to be Jew, but I don™t want 
to fight the country for this.ﬂ   
 

Q: You don™t think that Jews  can be racist, too?

A: Oh, yes.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can
 be very, very racist.  And I saw this on ma ny 
different occasion.  But it™s not the same  kind of 
r acism they have.  It™s a– I don™t know any 
Jew belonging to the KKK.   
 
Q: They wouldn™t probabl y accept them.  [Laughing] 

 

A: Absolutely, so I don™t think... but it™s, it ma ke
 a... Man is ma n, woma n is woma n, people are 
people.  And you can find people, different idea of
 people, different approach of life and so I 
think, yes, it can be a lot of, so
me  Jewish people can be racist.  
It doesn™t ma ke a– but before 
we have to define: what do they mean by being racist? 
 

Q: What do you think that means?  

 

A: Well, racism is some thing, it™s hate with no 
reason.  You like some  people, you like some  people 
living in this country.  You like some  people livi
ng in another country.  
You don™t like people the 
way they live, this can be racism.  But basi
cally, it™s not racism, it™s some thing, because you 

don™t like their way of laughing.  Black people ar
e very exuberant and maybe some American 
don™t like this and this can be a form of racism
.  And like I said before, Jewish people living in 
America are much more American than they are Je
wish.  And because of this, they can be racist. 
 

Q: I don™t understand that last.  Because they™re Jewish people living in America, they can be racist. 

 

A: Because they feel very safe in this country.  
And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish 
by tradition, but they belong to 
a mi nority.  And if you are in Fr
ance or in United State or any 
country in the world, you still are 
mi nority.  But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish 

people forget the background and say, ﬁBut I™m 
an American.ﬂ  And I say, ﬁNo, first you are 
Jew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they™re 
going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not 
because you™re an American.ﬂ  And this is the big problem and they lose  the identity of being 

Jewish, just  because they feel 
so comfortable.  They feel, 
It™s my country
.  Yes it is, in one way.  
But until, and you can see this on TV, this young 
man, who been speaking about racism against 
black, Jew, all the Jew have the pow
er in the bank.  It™s not true
, but in his mi nd it is.  And he 
killed people and he killed himsel
f.  You saw this on TV two or three days ago.  This is the big 
problem.  
 

Q: Let™s go back a little bit to, you were just tel
ling me  be fore about your 
experience as a child in 
Paris and the anti-Semitism that you experienced.  
Did you have, were all of your friends Jewish 
at the time? 
 

A: At the time I didn™t have a lot of friends, becau
se I was, I did a big sel
ection.  I™m not the kind of 
ma n who ha ve a lot of friends.  And yes, at the 
time all my fr iends, at the time were Jewish.  The 
reason is, I feel more comfortable with Jewish 
people than with non-Jewish people.  And again, I 
don™t speak about religion.  
I speak about tradition.  Going to a 
Jewish restaurant once in a while, 
it™s fun and it remi nd me  me mory.  Watching a 
movie with Jewish song, it™s fun.  I™ve been 
ma rried twice with non-Jewish woma n and I was mi ssi
ng this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or 
word.  Even in New York, when I go to New York, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it™s 

always funny.  And I always say, ﬁAre you Jewish? ﬂ  
 ﬁNo, but we use a lot of Jewish word here 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

in New York,ﬂ but they are not Jewish.  But it™s funny, I like it, because it™s some thing–  So 
when I was in France, I didn™t want to have non-
Jewish friend because I w
ould never know if the 
same  guy is not going to give me  a knife when the time come s.   
 

Q: You really fe lt that at a very early age? 

 

A: Oh yes, oh yes.   

 

Q: Didyou– 

 

A: Well, my br other came  back from the concentr
ation camp.  The only reason I left France to come  
in the United State, I decided to come  here 
in 1983, is because I didn™t
 feel comfortable in 
France.  Because up to this date, you have this 
anti-Semitism in France.  My brother, who is 

seventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn
™t feel it.  He said, ﬁNo, this
 is in your mi nd.ﬂ  And he is 
ma rried with a non-Jew woma n.  
She is wonderful woma n, but I don™t feel comfortable.  I... 
France is a beautiful country.  
I like to go on vacation, but I coul
dn™t live there anymore, because 
of all this background.  I™ve never 
been comfortable in France.   
 

Q: Did your family speak Yiddish at home? 

 

A: Yes, all the time. 

 

Q: Do you still speak Yiddish? 

 

A: Yes, uh huh.  I don™t find a lot of people I can 
speak Yiddish with, because
 most of the Jewish 
people here, don™t speak Yiddish.  But my grands
on, which is the son of my daughter, and my 
daughter doesn™t follow the relig
ion.  But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the 
difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi a
nd he said, ﬁBut  sometime t hey are racist  
between–ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYes, I 
know.ﬂ  I think if you put two me n with no religion on an island, 
there™s going to be racism, because ma n is stupid.  
They want to fight.  They want to fight for a 
reason.  The reason is religion.  And they are go
ing to fight about God, it™s my God, it™s not your 
God.  God is God.  Your God is my God.  There 
is only one God.  But we don™t want this, this 
way.   
 

Q: Going back to Paris, you were  talking a little 
bit earlier about the time
 when your two brothers 
were called in and they were deported. 
 Do you reme mber around when that was? 
 

A: It was March in 1942, when they did go to Ausc
hwitz.  Before it was a camp a little bit outside  
of Paris called Drancy, where all the Jewish people
 been put together for a length of time , I think 
it was between eight and ten month.  Where they st
art to shape the whole 
thing:  ﬁAre we going 
to send them?   What kind of train are we going to 
use? ﬂ  It was another camp not far from there, 
called Comp iègne, which was also the same  ki
nd.  So... there is a ma n, who came  here in 
Lexington, a Jewish ma n, who gave some thing– I™v
e got something, I will reme mber his name .  
And he explained what the German did have
 in mi nd.  And it™s amazing the way they did 
organize the whole thing.  Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together
 in a train, they didn™t 
know nothing, from whe r e they come, what 
they going to do, where they going to go.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

Everything was real on paper.  The train co
mpany didn™t know what they were going to 
transpor t, because it was special train for an
imals.  So, it was so well organized, and they 
prepared all this and from each country it was 
the same thing.  From Poland it was another way.  
From Yugos lavia it was another way.  From Au
stria it was another way.  It was really a 
technique they did have.  And the top of those guys
, I™m afraid to say he was a brain, because he 
was crazy.  But his name was Himmler, and he 
organized the whole thing.  And he organized 
this very well.  And you know, the Jewish people w
ho™ve been in camp, most of them were, what 
we call here blue-collar, simple people.  They 
didn™t think we™re going to kill them.  Even until 

they arrive in the camp, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, ﬁYou go this way, you go 

this way.ﬂ  No, it was nothing.  The only time my br
other realized he was in a bad direction is 
when one time , comi ng down from t he train, he 
didn™t go fast enough.  The SS slapped his face.  
And he was nineteen years old.  Then he reali
zed some thing is going to happen, now it™s another 
world.  But until then, well it was hard, they di dn™t 
have anything to eat in the train.  They didn™t 
have any water.  They didn™t have any... but it
™s going to clear up, no problem.  They di dn™t 
realize they go to the butcher.  
They go to die, by thousands.  A
nd this was the life.  They did go, 
because the only one who realize what™s going on
 were the educated people, the attorney, the 
doctor, the people who did study.  But they we
re not ma ny pe ople.  When my brother was 
deported in Auschwitz, it was a guy 
with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French 
army.  And he said, ﬁThey are going to do nothing 
to me.  I™m a colonel from the French army.ﬂ  
He died like all the one, just because
 he was Jew.  That™s all.  Th
ey didn™t care he was a colonel.  
He did have a high education.  Doesn™t ma ke any 
difference.  You are Jew, you must die.  It™s 
amazing, eh?   But– 
 

Q: Did you and your fa mily have any contact with
 your brothers while they were in Drancy? 
 

A: Yes, we did have the possibility
 to go around the camp, Private Honor 
(ph)
 from Haus 
(ph )
 let us 
in and we could communicate by sign.  So we can
 see they are alive, because in Drancy they 
didn™t kill anybody.  They been starving.  They ev
en allowed to receive some  package of food.  
But like I said, it was not a long tim
e, but communicate mout h to mouth?   No, it was impossible.  
No German in Drancy just the French military
 and the police.  No SS, no German, the whole 
camp was under the surveillance of the French police.   
 

Q: Were your parents su
rprised about that?    
 

A: It™s ve ry hard for me  to reme mber.  It™s very 
hard, because like I said, I was eight, nine year.  No, 
I have a hard time to reme mber the reaction of my
 father, the reaction of 
my mother.  No, I don™t 
have any recollection. 
 

Q: Do reme mber any talk about th
e political situat
ion at home?    
 

A: Well, you have to reme mber, my pa rent were 
not very high educated people.  My mo ther did 
barely write.  She spoke mostly the language, 
but she didn™t speak the... but it was, it was 
some thing.  You have to reme mber my parent left
 Russia because of the Bolshevism.  My parent 
were three hundred percent for th
e idea of communis m.  So, they 
were with one track mi nd.  So 
politically, even if I could re
me mber, I don™t think it would be accurate, because they were too 
much in one way.  I couldn™t have any discussion
.  Even my brother, who is alive now, I can, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

some  conversation about politic I cannot have with 
him, because he is still in one track.  Very 
hard to discuss about politic.  And again, like I sa
id before, Fr ance is his country.  It™s the best 
place, why should I go in America?

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape number one, side B of an inte
rview with Doctor Paul Pressman.  Do you, how, did 
your parents tell you at all, when they were ma ki
ng plans to escape to the South of France?   Wa s 
there any discussion with you about
 that or did it just happen? 
 
A: No, they, my parent, neither my mot her, neithe
r my father, didn™t discuss with the children.  
We™d been raised with a lot of authority from my folks.  And they say, ﬁThis is an emergency;  

we have to go.ﬂ  So my father is going to go th
ere.  We  are going to go there.  And we™ll see how 
it is going to be.  And we™ll decide day by day, because it was no other way.  We  have to leave 

everything.  Everything we got lost
.  We  left with too little l
uggage and that™s it, because we 
knew we never going to see anythi ng we left.  Because it was the end.  We  try to save our life, 

that™s all.  So another time  fo
r me a nd like my two other brother 
were in Drancy, so it was only 
another brother and me , so it was alittle bit easier.  So, my fa ther
 left with my other brother, 
Gaston, and I stay with my mother.  And at the tim
e it was, Paris became very, very difficult.  No 
place to hide, so my mother send me  through th
e Zone.  It was a line between the North and 
South and you have to pass the Zone.  And some
 French people for money, they direct you 

between the army.  And I  did go in South in Gren
oble.  And when I arrive in Grenoble, a friend 
of my mother took me  and three days later sh
e came down.  And we stay... and I don™t reme mber 
how long, maybe couple months, three months.  And it 
became  very dangerous to stay there.  So, 
she send me  to my father.  And where my father 
was, was more dangerous than there, so they 
decide... I came  back to see my mother and my mo
ther, reme mber I was nine years old.  So, they 
decide to send me  to Switzerland with a group of
 Jewish people, boys.  And I think I was the 
oldest one from all the boys.  We  we re about four
teen, fifteen.  So, we di
d go in one little town, 
just to the frontier, sl
ept there until midnight, 
one o™clock in the morn
ing.  Then two men took 
us, ma ke us walk and we arrive on the border.  
The Swiss took us and put us in a refugee camp. 
 

Q: Did you leave to go to the South of France imme
diately, was that before your brothers had been 
deported for Auschwitz from Drancy? 
 

A: No after, right after, because it was very, they
 realized now that™s it. 
 If we don™t do some thing, 
they are going to take us and we™re going to go to Auschwitz.  So, probably my parents said, let™s 

save there two boys and we™ll see.   
 

Q: Did you know anything about
 Auschwitz at the time?  
 

A: No.  No.  No, we didn™t know.  No, I don™t th
ink I knew some thing.  We  knew about Drancy 
because I did go to Drancy with my mother just  to
 see from far away my brother.  But we didn™t 
know anything about the camp where they burn cada
ver, where they put them in a chamber and 
put gas.  We  didn™t know all this.  No. 
 

Q: Do you remember from that time any restric
tions starting to be imposed on you as a Jew? 
 

A: Oh, the fi rst restriction was to carry the yello
w badge.  We  did have a yellow star, the Jewish 
star, with inside ﬁJewﬂ and you 
have to carry this in anythi
ng you wear.  So, you did have two 
way, either you don™t carry this th
ing and if they catch you, they 
kill you right there, or if you

have one, everybody can see you.  And this was only in 
the north of France, in Paris.  So this is 
why my mother decided to let us
 go down in south, because  it was, I reme mber when they start 
to give us this yellow badge to carry.  In the st
reet I used to live, it was a ma n, who was very old, 
ma ybe eighty-five, ninety and he was blind, Jewi
sh.  And he carried this yellow thing and I 
thought to myself, this is terrible, because if
 you can treat a huma n being, because of religion, 
it™s really the end.  And this is
, I think where my mother decided to send me , because, you know, 
it™s so easy.  It™s very hard to explain how 
does it look.  How do you realize a park, like here, 
Rupp Arena, downtown, with all the door closed, 
only one open and you push all the Jew inside.  
And it was, I don™t know, ma ybe fi ve hundred 
thousand, six hundred thousand.  I don™t know... 
all there.  And from there, they start to spread
 group.  And this was the beginning of the end.  So, 
it was time  to do some thing, leave, hide and this 
is where I think they or
ganized this, my mother 
and my father. 
 

Q: Did they have any connections with a
ny resistance organi zations at that time? 
 

A: I found out my mother was a captain from the 
French army.  Since when, I don™t know.  When I 
was in Grenoble, this is where I realized what
 she was doing, because I never saw my  mother 
with a gun.  And one day, she did have a big book, 
she always carry with her.  And I said, why 
do you carry this book?   And she said, well, I w
ill show you, but you forget about what you are 
going to see.  She opened the book and it was cut 
and it was a gun inside.  Because she used to 
bring food to Resistance who had been caught and 
put into the hospital.  And she survived the 
whole thing, because she die after the war, with–  So, yes she belonged to a group, but– 
 

Q: Was it, when you say French army, what exactly do you mean? 

 

A: The French regular army. 
 
Q: But the French army...  

 

A: Was illegal, because the real army were at the 
se rvice of the Germans.  All the, I don™t know how 
I™m going to tell you– 
 

Q: It was under de Gaulle? 

 

A: Yes.  Force Française  de l™Interieur 
(p h )
.  So, it was civilian.  They didn™t have any uniform, but 
they been working to liberate France under the or
der of Charles de Gaulle, who was in England.  
So, they been listening to the radio at night for sp
ecial me ssage.  But all this for me  was, I didn™t 
understand. 
 

Q: When did you find out that she was a captain with the army? 

 

A: I think I was, just before 
I left for Switzerland, which was about... when I left for Switzerland, I 
think it was in ‚44, around 1944, what month, I don™t reme mber.  But it was in 1944.  This is 

where she went... and I, we were a little bit surp
rised, because when we– when they took us to 
the frontier at Switzerland, two military fromSwiss did have the gun and say, ﬁApproach the 

door.ﬂ  And I don™t know if you know it, but the 
Swiss soldier are dressed exactly like the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

11
German sol dier.  Green with the same helmet.  A
nd I thought to myself, ﬁ That™s it, they got us.ﬂ  
The only difference, they got button who say Sw
itzerland.  And with the light, I saw the button 
and I said, ﬁUh huh, ma ybe we got a chance,ﬂ but 
otherwise they look exactly like the German.  
And they put us in the camp.  A lot of people–
 they did have to put us in a camp.  For  one 
reason is because, a lot of people left France to
 go to Switzerland, but the Swiss didn™t know who 
they was.  So, before, they did the same  thi
ng, they put them in a camp and ask questions.  
Interrogate them.  And fr om there, they put me  in
 another camp of childre
n.  And from there, you 
did have a lot of fa mily from Switzerland who sa
id, ﬁI can take one or two boy in my home .  I 
have the room.ﬂ  And this is how I did go to 
this priest, who was, not Catholic, he was– 
 

Q: Protestant. 

 

A: Protestant.  And I stay with 
him until the end of the war.   

 

Q: Before we go to that, tell me  
how you got from Paris to Grenoble. 
 

A: By myself.  My mother put me  on the train and 
she told me  a lot of thi
ng.  ﬁDon™t say this, don™t 
say this, don™t speak to nobody.  
Don™t do this.ﬂ  She give me  
a couple sandwich.  It took about 
ma ybe five, six hour.  
 

Q: Do you remember specifically what she told you to do and do not do? 

 

A: Yes.  ﬁIf anybody ask you if you Jewish, you 
say no.  Where do you go?   You go to see your 
uncle, to stay with him.  What his name ?  You don™t know.  Some body is going to be at the 

station to pick you up.  If any Ger man soldier come
 close to you in the train and you see he start 
to ask paper, stay close to some body, don™t be 
by yourself.ﬂ  Just basic common things, which I 
did.  And when I arrive at Grenoble, she also gi
ve me  a pass name .  And she said, ﬁDon™t go with 
anybody unless they tell you this.ﬂ  And I don™
t reme mber what it was.  A word like 
summertime
 
or something like this.  And this lady came to 
me and said ﬁSumme rtime,ﬂ and I said okay.  And 
I did go with her.  I didn™t have any l
uggage.  I did have a 
little package, but– 
 

Q: Were you afraid? 

 

A: I don™t think so.  If my memory is corr
ect, I was not afraid. 
 I don™t think so.   
 

Q: Was it kind of an adventure? 

 

A: No.  The funny part is all my 
life, like I said, I™m not religious, 
but all my l i fe, I believe since I 
was a little boy... and I used to speak about this with my mother. I believe we don™t die.  The 

body die, but the spirit stay
 alive.  So, I said, the worst can 
happen to me , they going to get my 
body, but my spirit is going to be reborn in an
other corp.  This helped me  a lot by ma king me  
feel more secure.  And dying, I never been afraid 
of dying.  It™s not a prob
lem for me.  I felt what 
should happen, will happen.  But no, I don™t think I was afraid.  No. 
 

Q: Did you have any problem
s on the train at all? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
12
 
 
  
12
A: No.  One time it was,  I reme mber because I 
was standing.  I didn™t have
 any seat.  I saw the 
German beginning the train and going room to room
 to ask paper.  And I thought to myself, now 
is the time to find myself a tutor.  So, it was a 
couple in the train.  And 
nicely I ask them if... I 
always been a good diplomat.  I asked if I can 
sit close to them.  And they felt some thing, 
probably.  The German c o me  in, they say, ﬁWho 
i s this boy?ﬂ  ﬁHe™s w
ith us.ﬂ  And it was 
finished.  And they left.  I reme mber the w
hole thing from Paris to
 Grenoble like it was 
yesterda y.  I could recognize the face of the German
 soldier.  But it was, no it was not a game .  I 
realized it wa s very serious, but when everybody 
dance, you have to dance.  And I thought if I 
don™t survive, no problem.   
 
Q: Who was there to greet you when you got off the train? 

 

A: A lady, and I don™t reme mber this lady, because 
I didn™t see her long enough.  She took me  to a 
group of people.  I stay with this group in a room
.  I stay about a day or two.  We  didn™t go out.  
And then my mother picked me  up a nd I stay w
ith her one day, and she put me  on another train.  
To save me , she try some thing... it was funny, but
 it was not funny in real.  In Grenoble, she 
found a way, I don™t know how she did, she found away to put me  in a– Catholic people who 

are– 
 

Q: Monks? 

 

A: Monk. 

 

Q: Monastery? 

 

A: Yes.  And I stay there for thre
e days and I couldn™t stand it.  A
nd I couldn™t stand it.  I left, I 
mean it was very hard to go out from the mona
stery.  So, I put myself whe n– and I saw when 
they took the garbage can.  And 
I found an empt y one and I did go inside.  And they put me  on a  
truck.  And I left the monastery and I did go see 
my mother.  When I arrive, and she said, ﬁHow 
did you get out?   Why?   What happened?   You™ve been
 safe!ﬂ  And I said, ﬁI can™t stay there, it™s 
impossible.  And one day or another, they going to
 come .ﬂ  So finally sh
e decided to send me  to 
Switzerland. 
 

Q: But how long were you in Grenoble before
 you went to Pau to join your father? 
 

A: Very short time, very short time.  We speak 
about ma ybe a week, not long.  Every time  it was a 
few days there, a few days there, back and forth, you know. 
 

Q: And when you were in Grenobl
e was that during the time  that 
the Italians were occupying that 
area? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember, did you have any 
interaction with 
Italian forces? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
13
 
 
  
13
A: No, Italian are very funny people.  They are 
very, how can I say, I won™t say roma ntic, but they 
are very nice.  Even now, I don™t know why, when 
I go to Europe, a lot of
 people, when I go to 
Europe I go with friends, ﬁLet™s go 
to Italy.ﬂ  I don™t want to go 
to Italy.  It™s not I don™t like 
Italian, but they always roma nce, they are ve
ry crying, very... I don™t lik
e Italian.  [Laughing] 
 
Q: Do you think that goes back to that 
time that you were there in Grenoble?   
 

A: I don™t know.  I don™t know.  I have a hard ti
me to analyze why I don™t 
like Italian, but I don™t 
know.  Spanish are comp letely different.  They
 are more rough.  Italian, when you go in Italy, 
me n walk in the street, holding hand by hand.  They
 are very different.  
And I don™t know why.  I 
mean I woul dn™t do any harm to Italian, but going 
to Italy.  The décor is always the same .  You 
been to Italy?   Did you go to the Piazza San Marc
o?   And you see the police ma n with the, they 
look like... I don™t like this.  [Laughing]  So, I avoi
d to go to Italy.  Three years ago, I did have to 
give a semi nar in Torino, Turin in French.  And I 
felt myself like twenty years ago, with all those 
guy, with the big parade, you know, they always– 
 

Q: A lot of pomp. 

 

A: Yes, they love this.  And I don™t.  So, I don™t go to Italy. 

 

Q: Why was it that your mother sent you to join your father in Pau? 

 

A: Because she thought it going to be much easier fo
r her.  I di dn™t know at the time.  But it™s going 
to be much easier for her to do what she was doi
ng.  Because I was not easy.  I was not easy.  I 
didn™t obey very good, when she say you stay in
 this room and you don™t move.  I didn™t see 
really the big danger.  You know, Italian people 
are very nice, I can go in the street and walk, 
you know.  She say, ﬁNo, you stay here.ﬂ  So, she 
said, ﬁI will send you to your father.  He™s 
going to take care of you.ﬂ  But it wa s very danger
ous where he was, so this is why they decide 
to send me  in Switzerland. 
 

Q: Was your father involve
d in the Resistance also? 
 

A: I don™t think so.  No, I don™t think so.  No, he
 was too hot-blood.  When it was bad where he was 
in Tarbes, and  I don™t know how
 they found out about him.  The only thing I reme mb er, he was 
in a big place, sitting on a bench and this pol
ice truck came to pick him up.  And it was about 
ten, twelve police ma n.  And when from the witn
essed friend who was with him, who survived, 
he was almo st naked.  He  fight so much, and hewas so strong.  And this
 was the last we knew 

about him.  Where was he kill ed?   We don™t know.  Where is 
his body?   We don™t know.  Wher e 
is he buried?  We  don™t know.  So, he fight for 
his life, but–  No, he di
dn™t have the diplomacy 
of my mother.  She was more soft.  For him, he 
was raised, he was orphan, so he was raised in 
Roma nia, the hard way.  So, even when he came in France, for him, no discussion, he punch, 

that™s all.  So. 
 

Q: How did you find out what happened to him?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
14
 
 
  
14
A: Because his friend, who was at 
the time  with him, saw the whole thing.  And he witnessed.  But 
he died a long time ago, this guy.  The only thin
g I reme mbe r , I™m... some people are visual.  
You can tell me  a story about a place you™ve b
een and I can see where you are.  And if you 
describe the place, and the border of the sea, w
ith the boats, with the m
ountain, the sun, the water 
come s on your leg, I can see the whole thing.  Th
e picture is very clear.  So, as soon as he 
explaine d to me  what happened, I can see the pi ct
ure.  I saw– I know where was the place.  So, 
I can see this whole thing.  And whe n th
i s  is  i n  my  me mo r y ,  I  r e me mb e r .    
 
Q: How did you get from Grenoble to Pau? 

 

A: I took the train.  My father told me  if anyt
hing happened, ﬁGo home , here is the place where is 
the money.  Take the mo ney, buy what you need.ﬂ  So, I did go buy a ticket and I did go see my 

mother again.  And she said, ﬁNow
 it™s time  for you to escape.ﬂ 
 

Q: So how long were you in Pau before you left again? 

 

A: Well, you see we moved from Pau to Tarbes, which 
is very close, ma ybe fifty miles.  So it was a 
few days, but I don™t reme mber.  I reme mber the r
oom he rent with the little kitchen.  How long 
did I stay there?   I have no idea, ma ybe tw
o weeks, ma ybe two months, I don™t know.   
 

Q: And you we re traveling the same  wa y that
 you had traveled fr om Paris to Grenoble? 
 

A: The same , by train.  Train in France is very safe
.  It™s always on time a
nd it™s very easy, clean.  
And I did have my way to speak to people a
nd trust them and they trust me .  And you know, 
you™re always ready to, if you toda
y, take the train a
nd see a boy, eight, nine years old and he™s 
by himself, you are going to tell him, ﬁCan I he
lp you?   Can I do some thing for you?   What is 
your life? ﬂ  ﬁ Well, I left my father and I™m going 
to meet my mother, but I™m alone on the train.ﬂ  
ﬁDo you have any money?   Do you want to eat some th
ing? ﬂ  This is a normal, right?   And this is 
what happened.  And people were very nice and ag
ain like I tell you, I got 
a little bit diplomacy.  
And I didn™t have any problem. 
 

Q: What was your father
 doing during that time? 

 

A: In Pau and Tarbes?   Nothing.  He couldn™t wo
rk.  He was just, probably waiting until the war is 
going to be fi nished.   
 

Q: Washe– 

 

A: It was not before, long before th
e war finished that he died.  I 
think it was a question of months, 
six month or seven month, some thing like this a
nd the war was finished.  He was not lucky.   
 

Q: Was he living openly as a Jew? 

 

A: No.  No, openly as a Jew, you dead.   

 

Q: He had false papers? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
15
 
 
  
15
 
A: Yes.  I know the name , I reme mber the name  of
 my mother, the false name , Shauvel.  But his 
name , I don™t reme mber.  He did have a false name
, that I don™t know.  I reme mber one time,  he 
did have, he became very ill.  My father never got ill.  He became very ill and when the doctor 

came, he palpate the stomach, and when he push in
 one side, he scream s o
 hard, they thought it 
was appendicitis.  And really it wa
s a kidney stone.  So, he was in
 the hospital for three, three, 
four day and he came out and it was all ove
r.  He lost weight, he was beautiful. 
 

Q: Was your brother there at the time? 

 

A: Yes.  And my brother, Ga ston, give  hi m a ha
rd time , because at the time he was seventeen, 
eighteen, some thing like this.  Very good looking 
boy and for him, war didn™t mean nothing.  He 
wants to have a good time.  That was a big 
problem between my father and him.   
 

Q: What did you do with your days?    

 

A: Start to read as much as I c
ould.  Wa lking with my father.  He used to... he loved to walk.  So I 
walked with him.  We did go buy 
some  food.  He was cooking.  We  
never been to a restaurant.  
He was cooking.  He was not such a good cook, but
 it was okay.  [Laughing]  But we stayed 
together mo st of the time.  He always got an 
eye on me .  And we stay together.  But I was young 
and it™s hard for me  to reme mber 
a lot of things.  But I have a lit
tle picture in my mi nd of things 
we did together.  I will show you a picture of
 the whole fa mily when I was a little boy. 
 

Q: Are there any other things that st
and out in your me mory from that time? 

 

A: No, everything is very clear.  Everything– the 
only thing which is not clear is the time, how 
long did I stay there?   How ma ny time did I go b
ack and forth?   But I reme mber where I was 
living with my mother.  I reme mber one time, I 
told you she did have a gun in the book, and she 
did go bring some  food in the hospital for Fren
ch Underground soldier,
 who were wound.  And 
we came ba ck to the house and we went on 
subway, but not underground, over ground.  The 
police, German police stopped the whole thing,
 ma ke us going down a
nd align everybody.  And I 
saw my mot her with the book under her arm and I sa
id, ﬁPhew, if they open this.ﬂ  They ask 
question, and up in the train agai
n and we left.  And I didn™t say anything to my mother.  She 
didn™t say anything to me .

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number two, side A of an inte
rview with Dr. Paul Pressman.  So you, when you, you 
were going back and forth a litt
le bit between, between where 
your father was and where your 
mother was and that™s not all together... you™re
 not sure about how ma ny times you went back 
and forth.  Is that what you said? 
 
A: Yeah, no more than twice at the mo st
.  One, sure, but twice at the most. 
 

Q: What happened... at what point
 were you... were you separated from your father?   We re you in, 
was it Tarbes? 
 

A: Tarbes. 

 

Q: Were you in Tarbes with your father when he 
was killed and then you left?   Or what caused you 
to leave for the last  time? 
 

A: No, I was there when he was killed. 

 

Q: Youwere? 

 

A: Uh huh.  I was not with him, but I was there a
nd this is how I knew about the stor y, because hi s 
fr iend told me.   
 

Q: Okay. 

 
A: And this is when I did go back and see my 
mother, who tried to find out, but we couldn™t.  I 
mean she couldn™t find out anythi
ng about it, because relation be
tween... the situation didn™t... it 
was not easy.  She couldn™t call anybody.  She 
couldn™t call the authorit
ies without revealing 
herself.   
 
Q: Were you with, was your brothe
r still with you at that time? 
 

A: Yeah, he didn™t live with us.  He live with, 
in another place.  I don™t know where.  Whe r e was 
he?   What was he doing?  I don™t remember
.  I don™t know what, where he was.   
 

Q: So, when you returned to Grenoble and prepared
 to go to Switzerland, your
 brother was not with 
you?    
 

A: No, no.  He never been, at this time  he never 
been with me .  The only time  I saw hi m again, is 
when the war finished, I was with Mr. Lederman 
in Switzerland.  And I 
said, ﬁNow it™s time for 
me to go home.ﬂ  And he say, ﬁP
atience,ﬂ you know, ﬁlet
™s wa it a little bit.
ﬂ  And I said, ﬁNo, I 
know where we™re going to find... I know where I™m
 going to find my mot her.ﬂ  And he said, 
ﬁYou don™t want to wait a little bit? ﬂ  Because 
it was a lot of thing going on.  And I said, ﬁNo, 
no, I would like to go now.ﬂ  So, he was a little b
it reluctant to let me  go, but he let me go.  And I 
did go to Grenoble, from Switzerland to Grenoble 
where my mother used 
to live.  And I didn™t

17
find her.  So, I did go to, there was a Jewish associ
ation in Grenoble, so I did go there.  And they 
said they knew about my mother.  They said, 
ﬁNo, she did go back to Paris and her sister 
apartment, because her apartment was with people,
 with your brother, Gaston.ﬂ  I  said, ﬁHow 
can I go? ﬂ   And they asked me , ﬁDo you have m
oney?   We ™ll buy you a ticket.ﬂ  They bought me  
a ticket, train again.  And I did go to Paris.  And 
when I did go to the train in Grenoble, I me t a 
young soldier, French soldier and I did the whole tr
avel with him.  He 
took care of me.  And 
before we left, this lady from the Jewish associat
ion sent a wire to my mo
ther and when I arrive 
in the train station in Paris, my mother and 
Gaston were there waiting for me .  And we  did go 
see, we did go to the apartment of her sister
, who die in Auschwitz and it was nobody in the 
apartment.  It was a very small apartment and 
oh, maybe... time for me is
 very hard... ma ybe two 
months later or three mo nths la
ter, the Jewish people from 
the camp, from Auschwitz,Dachau, 
Buchenwald, all those places, start to come  back 
in Paris.  And it was a big hotel, called Hotel 
Lutecia 
(ph)
 prepare for clean them, to ask paper, 
if they got anything, you know.  And Hotel 
Lutecia call us and say we have one Pressma
n.  So, we did go there right away and it was 
Bernard.  But we couldn™t see him.  We  didn™
t know where he was.  So, we wait, go, ask, 
couldn™t find him.  The next day... so, we did go 
home  at this apartment and the next day we 
receive a ma n, who said, ﬁYour son did go to the 
old apartme nt,ﬂ who was let™s say like, five 
blocks from where we were.  So, we did go by f
oot, walking and here, is comi ng, my brother.  
This is where we find out my other brother was d
ead.  He was killed in Auschwitz.  And Bernard 
was alive.  Then we did go to the apartment of my
 aunt, sister of my mo
ther, and life started to 
re-organize.  We  want to recupe
rate the fabric of my father. 
 Everything was gone, but at least 
the wall was there and my brother decided toŠbecau
se he was trai ned by my fatherŠto open the 
place.  And with my mother, they
 st art to re-open the place and I started to go to college, to 
school, to school first.  And after I decided to 
go to college.  And it was a little fight, family 
fight, because they want me  to be an upholsterer
 like my fathe r  and I said no, I want to study 
me dicine.  Everybody said, ﬁBut we
 cannot help you,ﬂ and I sa id, ﬁI
 don™t ask for help.  I will 
work myself.ﬂ  I found a little room a nd I wa
s working, doing a lot of things and studying 

me dicine.  After this, I became the doctor of the fa mily.  [La ughing] 
 

Q: Let™s go back because I want 
to hear about your time  in Swit
zerland and I want to hear, can you 
tell me  a little bit more in detail 
about your journey to Switzerland?    
 

A: Uh huh.  Ye ah, it was a very, very interesting.  I think I wouldn™t study 
all the study I did, if I 
didn™t go with Pastor Lederman and his wife.  Because I speak always about him.  Hi s name  was 

Charles, but his wife was something great.  I m
ean, she was a teacher in school for children, but 
she was a very, very strong person.  And when th
ey accept me, I receive a tag around my neck.  
They put me  again in another train from Geneva 
to, it™s a little town wh
ere they used to live, 
Rances.  Very small town.  He was the pastor of
 the town.  And they came and picked me  up.  I  
didn™t know where I was.  Mine 
parrain
, my godfather was very, ve
ry cheerful, very big open 
mi nd, very smart ma n.  They were a very nice c
ouple, but they never could have any children.  
So, mi ne godfather was priest, so 
he said, ﬁYou going to go to the synagogue.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁI 
never been to a synagogue and I don™t want to go
 to a synagogue.ﬂ  He said, ﬁI™m sorry, you™re 
Jewish, you™re going to go to the synagogue.ﬂ  S
o, every week I did have to go and it wa s far 
away, because there was no synagogue where he was. 
 So, I did have to take the bus and I didn™t 
like it all.  But he said, ﬁNo, you 
have a wonderful religion, you have
 to keep with it.  Okay.  
And I don™t want for you, unless you feel, but you
 don™t have no obligation to come
 in my

church.  If you want to come , no problem, but 
I don™t want you...ﬂ And I said, ﬁCan I ring the 
bell?ﬂ  And he said, ﬁIf you want to, Sunday morn
ing you can ring the bell.ﬂ 
 So, I ring the bell 
and he introduce me  in a Sunday, when I was at
 his place.  The second Sunday he introduce me  
to all the congregation.  Swiss pe
ople are very, very nice people. 
 And they treat me  like the son 
of the house.  They give me a room.  I reme mb
er they did have a German Shepherd, who was 
trained.  He was in the same  ti me ŠI don™t know
 how you call thisŠa priest who take care of 
prison people.  And he used to go with his dog, 
in case one of the prisoner did go away, the dog 
is going to be able... He was a very, very funny ma
n, very s mart, very funny ma n.  And I help as 
much as I could.  I carry the milk, because they di
d have a lot of cow.  So, I work outside of the 

school for three, four hour every day, carrying th
e milk from the cow to the company where they 
ma ke the cheese.  And it was really, a fa mily.  Th
ey want me  to learn how to play piano.  They 
did have a pi ano.  And since I have my own piano and I play because of them.  He a l ways, he 

make me fee l  something I never felt before: th
e importance of knowledge.  And this is when I 
start to read, this is when I star t to write.  I 
spend with them less than 
one year, but I think the 
foundation of my life wa s based on this time I sp
end with them, because they were so good and 
so hard.  They were not... they were sweet, but 
they let me  pass nothing.  I did have my job to do 
and I better do it, othe rwise–  And it became nor
mal with me and really 
I spend... I learn how to 
love nature.  Nature in Pa ris, 
you don™t know how to differentiate 
champignon
–you know 
what–? 
 

Q: Mushrooms? 

 

A: Mushrooms.  He took me to the woods, days, 
to say this one is not 
good, this one is good.  Took 
the good one, brought it home , cook them, ma ke a meal
 with it.  I didn™t k
now all this.  I didn™t 
have no idea.  And it was very good for me , because
 it was a foundation of life.  And every time  
up to this day, I think all the ti
me  about what they did to me  as a kid.  And I became a ma n 
because of them.  And this is 
why, all the time, even like I sai
d, I did go see them last, between 
‚98 and ‚99, Christma s.  And I couldn™t find them, they moved.  I called everywhere.  But 

otherwise, every time I go to Europe, I go see th
em.  We spend beautiful time, quality time, even 
if we don™t speak together, he is the same .  And 
she is the same .  In my
 mi nd, she is the most 
beautiful woman I met in my life.  She, the last
 time  I saw he r I think she was seventy-two and I 

think she was as beautiful as she was when I was 
a little boy.  And he is th
e stronger man.  It was 
really some thing.  For me, it was a big chance to 
meet those people.  And like I said, when I did 
go back and I found my mother.  I said, ﬁThe firs
t thing we can do, as soon as we get a little bit 
money, I want for you to meet.ﬂ  And I think it wa
s one year later, I bough
t a used car and I took 
my mother and we did go see them.  And they were very happy and I was very happy to see them 

again.  And like I said, I always
, any chance that I did have to
 go, I did go see them, because I 
felt this... we were not fa mily, but it was more th
an fa mily.  It was a good, a good thing.  It™s a 
good me mory. 
 

Q: Do you ever think about the irony of that–? 

 

A: Yes.  Oh, gosh.  Life is irony, the whole 
life.  Wh en–. you know, when you become  old, older 
than younger, life is an irony.  Why t his happened?   What is the purpose of life?   What is the 

reason of life?   We  don™t know.  But I think everyt
hing is written, you in your
 life, another one in 
another life, everything is written. 
 I say since a long time, we all 
have a ticket in the pocket.

You have the date of birth and there is no date
 where you™re going to go, to be gone, but really 
there is one, but you don™t know it. 
 And it™s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we 
celebrate birth of people, but we 
don™t celebrate death and death is so
me thing of life.  It™s the end 
of life.  If you did have a bad lif
e, you™re going to have a bad time to
 re-incarnate in a good life.  
But if you look your life and you said yes, I did 
have bad time  like everybody else, but the good 

time were good.  And when I reme mber all this
, all the good time, it was wonderful.  It™s 
experience.  And in life, you cannot
 have all the time, good time.  A
nd on top of this, I say this 
too, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but 

compared to destiny, money is nothing.  Destinyis what is going to ma ke you what you are.  

You are going to be able to enjoy anything: a 
fruit, a good meal, good company.  And when I say 
good compa ny, feeling you are with some body, friends
, and you are on the same  level.  You can 
exchange... if you say some thing a little bit diffe
rent, people are not going to laugh.  They are 
going to say either ﬁWha t do you me an by this?ﬂ 
or they™re going to say, ﬁI know what you 
mean.  I feel it, what you feel.ﬂ  And this is 
the purpose of life, but it
™s not every day you find 
things like this and it™s not 
every day you are in tune with th
ings.  But when you are, it™s 
wonderful and the rest, well, you have to do wi
th.  You receive a bad bill, you have a bad 
problem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhe
re... it™s tough, but you have to deal with it.  
You say, okay, I will reme mber next time I™m going 
to have a good time, this flat tire.  It was 
bad, but in exchange look what good time I 
got now.  And I think it™s a good philosophy. 
 

Q: As far as the idea of destiny, do you apply th
at to the Holocaust?   Do you think that the 
Holocaust, I mean when you me ntioned being pr
edestined, having some thing written down... do 
you think of the Holocaust that way?    
 

A: Yes, yes.  And it™s ve ry hard, ma ybe it™s b
ecause as a Jewish boy I 
can say this.  You know, 
Jewish people accept Jewish jokes from another 
Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they 
don™t like it.  Did the Jewish people deserve wh
at happened?   I don™t think so.  Nobody deserve 
to suffer this way, but in the whole world, in 
the whole idea of human people, is it something 
who is going to serve huma nity?   I think so. 
 I think so.  How ma ny people, who were in 
Auschwitz, in all those camps, are going to be ab
le to use it?   Minority.  But the one who are 
going to be able to do it are 
going to bring some thing and we
 don™t know where we™re going to 
put this.  On the newborn?   There is a ne
w book, written by a Rabbi, and people don™t like him 

very much, because he write, he wrote this book a
bout reincarnation.  And he 
said a lot of people 
call him, write to him and they say, ﬁI™m born in 
a Catholic family.  I™m Catholic.  I go to the 

church every Sunday.  I believe on Jesus Christ and 
I believe in God, but inside of me  I got this 
Jewish feeling and I don™t understand why.ﬂ  
And it™s uh, how can I say, 
it™s surprising.  And 
from what he say, he thinks they were in 
the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another 
corps
, but 
they got this knowledge and they want to expl
ain this.  Long time  ago, ma ybe not so long, but 
twenty years ago, you never spoke about reincar
nation.  A lot of people knew about, but they 
don™t want to say anything, because they say, ﬁWell,
 they going to think I™m crazy.ﬂ  Now it is 
more open.  Sometime when I feel people react an
d it™s a small group... I give
 a lot of lecture on 
acupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human 
body and the illness of some  people.  And I 
go a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of
 people react and say, ﬁI felt this.  I felt I was 
in another life.  I cannot pinpoint, but I know this 
is not my first life.ﬂ  So, I think, coming back 
to the idea of the Holocaust, 
it served a purpose, which one, I 
don™t know.  But I™m sure it serve 
a purpose.  If you say this to my brother, he™s going to laugh for three hour,
 but it™s okay.  And I

mean, it™s his problem, it™s not mi ne.  I don™t brin
g any proof, but I know there is a purpose.  Can 
it be another Holocaust?   Yes.  The same  one 
we saw?   No.  It™s going to be some thing 
completely different, but Hell is here on 
earth, so anything can happen.  Anything.   
 
Q: When you think in those terms, how do you, how 
do the Germans fit in?   So– are they carrying 
out some thing that needs to happen?  That is pred
estined?   In other words,
 are they attuned with 
destiny in some  way? 
 

A: To answer your question you have to read a littl
e bit about Hitler, which very few Jewish people 
want to touch.  I read the life of Hitler.  He di
dn™t have any chance in life.  He could not succee d 
to nothing.  He was nobody.  He came at the right time and some body a bove used him.  But he 

was nothing.  Are we going to reme mber Hitler?  
 Yes, for a long time, but not for the real 
purpose.  Because who was Hitler?  Nothing. 
 Germany was ready.  Germany need some body 
like Hitler and if it was H
itler or George or anybody else, it w
ould be the same thing.  We speak 
about the devil.  Germany, the German people at 
this time , did find the chief of the devil and 
everything was so simp le to organize.  You see 
in life, people who try to organize some thing, 
something small, a factory... they never make it.
  Because it™s not the time and some body above 
Earth, who™s got the little button, don™t push the bu
tton, say, because it™s not for him.  It™s not 
meant to happen, not with him.  So we are not going to move. 
 

Q: So you can kind of think of the Holocaust as be
ing Divine will carried ou
t and that Hitler was an 
instrume nt of that? 
 

A: That™s right, that™s right.  Because the whole st
ory like, and I don™t... Rothschild said some thing 
one day, ﬁFor you Jewish people if you like it or not
, this is the truth.  
You have the low level 
Jewish people, you have the mi ddle level Jewish 
people and you have the aristocratic Jewish 
people.ﬂ  And it™s true.  All the Jew are so smart,
 all the Jew are doctor?  
 No.  What about the 
Jew who is a firema n?   What 
about the Jew who is a police ma
n?   He™s got the brain of 
Rothschild?  No.  We  di d have, I mean... we, they
 did have to show to huma nity Jewi sh people 
are not the enemy.  Because, example, Israel, you 
have prostitute in Israel.  Jewish wo ma n who 
are prostitute?  You say this to my father, if he wa
s alive at the time, there 
are Jewish pr ostitute?  
He would say, ﬁNever.  Woma n, Je
wish woman never can be a pros
titute.ﬂ  Yes my dear, there 
are Jewish prostitute.  You have lot of people in 
Israel who are crooked.  
We are people and this 
should stop racism.  And when you speak with– a
ll black people are stupid?   No.  You have a 

lot of black people who are born in poor fa mil
y.  They don™t know what is good from bad.  They 
have a father, but they don™t know who he is. 
 And you comp are this bl
ack ma n with a judge 
from the high circuit, who judge
 things?   How can you?   They 
are two black people.  With 
Jewish people it is the same  thing.  This is
 why I think the Holocaust was ma de, one of the 
reasons in my mi nd, to show we are people. 
 There are good Jew and you have bad Jew.   
 

Q: What do you think some  of the other reasons are? 

 

A: About the Holocaust? 

 

Q: Yeah.

A: Human race like atrocity.   When they are... 
let™s say you are on the ro
ad and there is a bad 
accident .  I st op.  I am a doctor.  If I can hel
p, I will do it.  But I don™t want to st op to see 
some body bleeding, just for the pleasure.  You have 
a crash of a plane.  There was one big one in 
Paris a long time ago.  Everybody come because so
me body t old them you can see a leg here and 
a head there.  And in your norma l mi nd you are go
ing to say, ﬁOh, this is terrible.ﬂ  But when 

you speak with people, they love to see this.  
Wh y do you think they show so bad thing on TV?   
Because people like it.  I don™t think it™s a very 
good thing to show all this
... it™s terrible.  They 
like it.  Whe n you see all this blood going out, this 
head split, the eyes fall down.  They like it.  
People are mean [laughing] sometime, but this is
 the way we  are, and I think the Holocaust 
helped this, to show, you know... they di
d this, can we see a little bit–?

Tape 2, Side B 
 
Q: Do you think people are learning 
not to see things that way, thr
ough looking at that
 experience in 
retrospect? 
 
A: I have a friend, he was an attorney and he rais
ed his child, his boy, in th
e religion.  Not– but, he 
raised him as a Jewish boy.  And the boy is a 
spoiled, what I called a spoiled American boy.  

And his father insists for him to go to Wa shingt on to see the Holocaust mu seum.  And he said, 

ﬁOh, I don™t want to go there.ﬂ  He said, ﬁI insist
, I want for you to go see a little bit of what did 
happen.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁSo? ﬂ when he came back.  
And he said, ﬁ Well, he was not the same .  He 
didn™t have no idea.  He heard Ho
locaust.  He knew it was a muse
um at Washington, but he said, 
‚It™s a museum.™  But when he came back, it was 
not a joke.  He said, ‚I didn™t know it was like 
this.™ﬂ  And I think this is w
hy there is a museum.  This is 
why you have people working in the 
Holocaust, not to forget.  Not to enjoy, but not
 to forget, for young people, Jew or Non-Jew, 
anybody, to see:  This happened.  This is not a m
ovie.  This happened, so you have to reme mber 
to do anything you can, we can, not to happen again. 
 

Q: I™m pursuing kind of a me taphysical line of 
questioning, but do you think, 
so you feel like people 
have the power to ma ke it not happen again? 
 

A: Yes, they do, absolutely.  If they know wh
at™s going on.  Because if they don™t know what™s 
going on... When you see a movie and you know it™s fic
tion, if you see it or you don™t, it™s not a 
problem.  But when things happen... I have a movie from the camp.  This  camp was liberated by 

the English army and the English are very tough.  
They show, they took th
e whole, bigger than a 
village, I think it was about fift
een, twenty thousand people.  And they opened where they put all 
the dead, the cadaver, the Jewish people who they 
killed, they opened this with a spec ial ma chine 
and they forced every people living in the town
 to carry a dead body and put it on the truck to 
give them a decent burial.  Don™t you think th
ey are going to reme mber?  Yes, they will.  
Because when you touch with your hand, a deadbody, you reme mber for the rest of your life.  

And if we c ould ma ke people touch people or no
thing else, force the you
th to go to a hospital 
here, in Lexington, Louisville, anyplace, once an 
hour, every week and just walk and see people 
suffering, they are going to be a little bit differe
nt.  American youth think 
they are indestructible, 
you know?   They got the power.  They can do anythi
ng until they die.  This is why you have so 
ma ny peopl e who cripple themselves.  They jump from, with a cord around their feet, you 

know–  ﬁI™m the best,ﬂ you know, the guy who jump w
ith the motorcycle in Colorado.  Okay, if 
the guy survive, it™s okay, if he die, everybody should 
see it, because life is not
 a joke.  Life is a 
gift.  You can use it badly and you can use it inte
lligently, but just by jumping and so you see... 
it™s like the guy who jumped from t he Eiffel Towe
r and he say, ﬁNothing can happen to me .ﬂ  
And you know, he fall down and every stage, he  
say, ﬁYou see, nothing ha ppened to me ,ﬂ until 
he reach the downstairs and then that™s it.  Y
ou don™t... gravity is like life, you don™t play game 

with life.  Ta ke a knife, stic
k it in your stomach and you™ll 
see what happen.  And everybody 
should know about the Holocaust just
 as a remi nder.  Justice in th
is country is too lenient.  
Yesterday they liberate a ma n, who 
did abuse children.  He got ten 
year and after fi
ve year, they 
let him go.  He™s going to do it again.  What shoul
d we do?   This is another discussion, but don™t 
let hi m loose, because he™s going to take care... 
he ™s going to take anot her innocent child.  This 

ma n is sick.  We  have to do some thing about this.  But don™t say, ﬁWell, you know, what can we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
23
 
 
  
23
do? ﬂ  What do you mean, what can we do?   Let™
s us do the best we can, but do some thing.  
Don™t let a man wild w
ith norma l people.   
 
Q: We™ll have more of a chance to talk more 
about these things I hope, but let™s go back to 
Switzerland.  Before you joined the Le dermans,
 you were in a refuge camp for a couple of 
months, it sounded like. 
 

A: Yeah, it start, it start–  I arri
ved on the first, a refuge of civil,
 I mean March ‚44, the thirty of 
March, ‚44 and I stay until, one mo nth about.  After 
this they put me  in a camp of r e fugee for the 
25
th
 of April.   
 

Q: April25
th
– 
 

A: That™s ri ght, until Ma y the 19
th
.  And after this I was authorized 
to live in Rances with Pastor 
Lederman.  It was the May the 30
th
, 1944. 
 

Q: Do you have any me mories of your time  in those refugee camps? 

 

A: Yes, I do.  It was not fun.  It was very strict. 
 We slept on the floor.  I 
don™t speak about the food.  
We survived.  But it was a camp.  I mean, it was 
not a vacation camp.  It was really very hard, 
but like I said before, it was all 
kind of people.  You did have ba
d people.  You did have all kind 
of people.  So they couldn™t do otherwise.  Bu
t by the date, you realize 
it was not a long time, it 
was ma ybe two months.  After what I saw before
, two month for me  was 
nothing.  Because like I 
said, after this, life was gr eat with Pastor Lede
rman.  So, it was an experience again.  For me , 
everything is an experience.  When I ™ m goingto die, it™s going to
 be an experience. 
 
Q: Did you cross legally into Switzerland? 
 

A: Illegally. 

 

Q: Illegally. 

 

A: Oh yes, completely illega l.  This is why they
 put us in a camp.  Because
 if it was legally, I enter 
Switzerland, it was no problem.  But it was illega ll
y, because they didn™t want to open the door.  
They didn™t want to, for anybody to come  in Sw
i t zerland, because they didn™t have any room.  

Everybody wants to go there.  So, it 
was hard and they did have too much people.  So, they tried 
to push away all the people, until 
the last two or three weeks, th
e Swiss Army was on the border.  
And then anybody who wants to cross, they shoot 
them.  They didn™t want to let anybody come  
in, because  a lot of German put civilian things 
to come .  They didn™t want to let them in. 
 

Q: What did you do with your days during the time  in the camp? 

 

A: In the camp ?   Li ke a prison, you walk around.  
You think about food.  You cry.  You fine if you 
know somebody– 
 

Q: Did you know anyone?   Di
d you have any friends? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
24
 
 
  
24
 
A: No, no, there was no... I didn™t know anybody. 

 

Q: And did you have anything to do... Did you meet the Ledermans before they said ﬁYes, we™ll 
take this young ma n? ﬂ 
 

A: No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  They– this guy would 
go with this guy, this guy with this guy.  How 
did they decide for me  to go with Pastor Lede
rman?   I don™t know.  But 
I know I was designed to 
go there.  I did go there.  
And that™s it.  [Laughing] 
 

Q: What was Mrs. Lederman™s name ?   Do you remember? 

 

A: I knew you going to ask me .  And I can not remember. 

 

Q: Maybe it will come  back late
r.  And you went to school there? 
 

A: In Rances, yeah.  It was a 
little school, you know, an elementary school, where I was not very 
good.  The teacher said I don™t do any effort to le
arn.  When I think about, I know why.  At the 
time I didn™t know why.  But when I think, you know, I was– I did go over my head, study for 

what?   For who?   You know, it™
s not like a ma n who is twenty and decides to become  an 
attorney.  He is going to study har
d, night and day.  But at my age,
 nine years old, you put me  in 
a school to learn about ma the matic
 and all this.  I don™t care.  I want to know, where is my 
brother, where is my mother?   I would like to 
know what a m I going to become ?   How long this 
war is going to be?   So, no, I was not 
a good student at all.  [Laughing]   
 

Q: Did everyone know you were Jewish? 
 
A: Oh yes.  Oh, he was proud of it.  He was 
telling to everybody... well, he introduce me , ﬁThis is 
my little Jewish boy.ﬂ  Oh no, people were very
 open and friendly.  I mean, you know, ﬁI got a 
Jewish boy.  No, no, no, this is my Jewish boy.ﬂ  He was proud of it.  The time was very good, I 

mean everything was... it was nothing, I can™t say 
they were mean.  The only time he was ma d at 
me  is one day, I touch his gun.  He did have a gun
 and I touched it.  And he was ma d.  He said, 
ﬁLet me  show you how dangerous it is.ﬂ  And he
 shot something in the room and boy, I never 
touch his gun again. [Laughing] They were very 
nice.  I have really only wonderful me mories. 
 

Q: Did you ma ke any friends 
with any othe
r children? 
 

A: No.  Probably yes, but, you know, I left.  And it 
took a little bit time  befor e  I came  back, so it 
was... No, I don™t reme mber anybody.  I™ve been b
ack to the little town and I did hardly 
recognize the place.  It was people in the street 
and I was looking, do I know them?   Do I don™t?   
Very hard.   
 

Q: You me ntioned that, that was the time  when you think you started to get interested in me dicine? 

 

A: Uhhuh.

Q: How did that happen? 
 

A: Gradually, gradually I start 
to, I was very interested in 
the huma n body, t he function of the 
huma n body and the natural healing, 
mostly.  But it was very little 
by little.  I cannot say it came  
one night, I wake up in the morni
ng, I said, ﬁI want to be a doctor.ﬂ  No, no.  I thought it would 
be interesting to study and every 
day said, ﬁOh, but it™s going to 
be hard.  It™s going to, ma ybe 
I™m not fit for this.ﬂ  So, little by little, and it 
came, and I start my study.  Even when I start my 
study, I said ﬁI will start, if it 
works, it™s okay.  If it doesn™t wo
rk, I™ll do some thing else.ﬂ  So, I 
was not saying ﬁI will do it.ﬂ  No.  ﬁI will try, if
 it doesn™t work, I will do so me thing else.  I will 
sell refrigerator.ﬂ  [Laughing] 
 

Q: Were you aware of what was going on in the war? 

 

A: You mean when I was at mi ne, at Lederman? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Oh yes, oh yeah.  He told me  everything.  He 
explained to me , ﬁHere they are.  Here are the 
Americans, here are the Russians.  They are going to
 circle like this.ﬂ   Li
ke I said, he was a very 
intellectual ma n and he wants to 
tell me  as much as he can.  And he was treating me  like I was 
his son.  So, I have to be in
formed, if I like it or not. 
 

Q: Were you aware of the scope of what 
was happening to the Jews in Europe? 
 

A: I don™t... not really.  I knew it was bad, but
 I didn™t realize really what was going on. 
 
Q: Do you think Pastor Lederman knew? 
 

A: I think so.  He didn™t wa nt to 
talk to me  about it, but he knew pr
obably.  I always suspect that he 
was Jew, with his name .  It™s a Jewish name .  
And, but one day, I said some thing like this and he 
didn™t answer me, meaning he doesn
™t want to speak about it.  A
nd I stop right there, because I 
didn™t want to be, you know, mean.  If he did want to
 tell me , he would at the time .  But he didn™t 
say anything, so I didn™t pursue.  That™s it.  
We  stopped there.  But Lederman, it™s a Jewish 
name .  Unless– it™s probably what he did.  Hi
s father was a tailor.  So, ma ybe he be came  
Protestant.  You know the joke we do?   How do 
you change a Jew to become  a Protestant?  You 
hit him in the back and he turn around and he prot
est.  And he become  a Protestant.  [Laughter.] 
 

Q: They should have told that
 one to Martin Luther, huh? 
 

A: Yes.   

 

Q: So do you reme mber hearing that the war ende
d while you were in Switzerland?   We re you in 
Switzerland when the war ended?    
 

A: Yes.  And well it was in ever
y radio, every paper.  It was bi
g celebration.  At the same time it 
was very scary because, like I said, you know, the German tried to go away the best they could.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
26
 
 
  
26
I don™t think I left right away.  
It took me , ma ybe two or three 
weeks, maybe a month before I 
left .  But I di dn™t st ay long after 
I heard the war was finished.  And 
did want to join my fa mily.  
And, but it was– yes, it was in Switzerla
nd I heard all this.  
Yeah, I was there. 
 
Q: Do you remember celebrating 
in any particular way?    
 

A: No, no, no.  Like I said, it was 
a little village where we were.  
And Pastor Lederman was a little 
bit sad to see... this I reme mber
 vividly.  It meant, ﬁYou stay 
with us, we treat you like fa mily 
and now the war is finished, you can™t wait to go 
away.ﬂ  And at the time,
 I didn™t know what to 
say.  I felt ba d, but my reaction was norma l.  An
d his reaction was norma l, too.  So, we both 
been right, but I want to go back and find how 
ma n y  me mb e r  o f  my  fa mi l y  a r e  al i v e .   B u t  w e  
never spoke about this after this
; it wa s finished.  We didn™t speak
 about– anymore about this.   
 

Q: So you™re some thing like thirteen years old at that time, right? 

 

A: Yeah, I think so, something like this.  
Yeah, twelve, between twelve and thirteen. 

 

Q: And you just left on your own and forged out 
to look for your parents without any assistance? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah.  No, it™s uh, I always 
been a traveler.  I like to travel
.  I was used to, it was not... I™ve 
been to Japan five years ago.  And I don™t know 
why, at the last mi nute I panic.  And it was 
because of the language.  I don™t speak Japanese.  And I panic, and I did have to speak to myself 

and said, 
It™s nothing.  It is another land.
  And when I was there, it was easy, it was no problem.  
I enjoy.  I got lost ma ny time and I always found my way back.  It was no problem.  But no, it 

didn™t occur to me to say, 
I™m not going to go back because nobody is going to take me .
  I was 
not used to have some body who take me  by the 
hand and bring you everywhere.  I was used to 
go by myself.   
 

Q: Was it some thing from before the war that you thi
nk was just in your nature or is this some thing 
that... ? 
 

A: Yeah, I think it was in my nature.  It™s so
me thing... I™m shy on things.  I know where I™m shy, 
and I know where I™m not shy.  Every personality 
is different.  I think we have to know our 
weakness points.  And I, this wa
s not on my weakness.  It would be very hard for me  to ask 
some thing on my favor, but I can
 ask anything for some body else. 
 But traveling never bothered 
me.  I can go anyplace.  I like to travel. 
 

Q: I assume  that during that time that you were w
ith the Ledermans, you didn™t have any word from 
your mother at all. 
 

A: No, not at all, because, the only time  I reme mb
er is, we tried to reach my mother by phone, but 
she was not home .  I me an, she was 
not at the home where she used to
 be when I left her.  In the 
apartment of her sister, they didn™t have any  pho
ne.  And it was a big mess.  So, I couldn™t reach 
her.  The only way to reach her is by the Jewi
sh Association, who knew exactly where she was 
and they sent a cable saying, ﬁYour son is leaving 
Grenoble at this time  and he™s going to be in 
Paris in the 
gare
 at this time .ﬂ  And 
t hey were there, so.

Q: Going back to one more thing, you mentioned 
that while you were there at the Lederman™s you 
started to read a lot and to 
become  interested... do you reme mber what you were reading? 
 

A: No, no.  I don™t... no.  They did have hundreds of
 books and I was very interested on philosophy.  
I like philosophy of everything, life
, but I don™t know what I was r
eading.  It™s too far away. 
 

Q: Did you talk to Pastor Lederman at all about 
your interest in educati
on or in studying me dicine 
or any–?   Did he encourage you in any way? 
 

A: No, no.  The only thing he knew to tell is, I... 
you know those little bugs who eat potato?   Every 
time, every day we did have to go for an hour and co
llect this and put it in 
a bottle.  And I used to 
say it hurt my back, so he used to call me  
Paul with the ribs who go up and down.  He  cannot 
bend.  So this is why– he ma de fun of me , 
because he thought I wasŠand I was probablyŠ
lazy.  Some  work outside I didn™t like too much. 
 I did like to go to the mushroom, but I didn™t 
like to bend and put my hand on this mud and all 
things, you know.  So, he always ma ke fun of 
me .  But he said, ﬁYou going to like to give spe
eches.  You™re going to like to speak in front of 
crowd.ﬂ  And it™s true.  I give a lot of semi nar 
and I feel very comforta
ble.  I don™t have any 
problem with people.  And if some  people ask 
me  question I cannot answ
er, I said, ﬁI don™t know 
the answer, but if you give me  one of your card, 
I will find out and write to you.ﬂ  But we never 
spoke about what kind of study I™m going to do or wh
at is going to be my future, what kind of 
job I™m going to do.  No.  Because I don™t thi
nk, I didn™t know anything myself.  I don™t have 
any idea what I™m going to do.  But I know, the onl
y thing I know is, they change my life.  
They... the orientation was different.   
 

Q: And do you reme mber reuniting with
 your mother and your brother? 
 

A: Uhhuh. 

 

Q: Can you talk about that mome nt? 

 

A: Well, I have to say some thing.  I don™t know 
if you™re going to find this
 funny or different.  I 
didn™t have a very good relation with
 my brother, Gaston.  Never. 
 Never been real brother.  
Why, I don™t know.  But my mother, when I was ve
ry young, I used to discuss with her, as long 
as she did ha ve the power on me , it was okay.  But when I grew up and because of the separation 

of this, my a ttitude changed.  A
nd my mother is a very, used to 
be a very strong personality.  She 
wants to organize everything.  Example, when Icame to study chiropractic in the United States... 

I was married at the time and my daughter was 
eighteen months old.  And she didn™t understand 

why I took my daughter with me  instead of leav
ing my daughter with her for two year.  And I 
said, I don™t know how you can think about me  
leaving my da ughter for two year, eighteen 
month?   I™m never going to be her father anymor
e.  So, we did have a very, very big discussion 

about this and for the time I was gone, she never s
poke to me .  And my br
other, Bernard, reunite 
us when I came  back.  But the problem is, I wa
s at the time, as stubborn as she was.  And we 
were always on challenge.  I like her, I woul
d do anything for her, but
 I couldn™t receive any 
order from her.  And it™s a feeling very hard to
 explain, because like when
 I open my office... she 
came in.  She wants to organize my
 office.  And I said, ﬁMother, it
™s my office, it™s my place and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
28
 
 
  
28
I™m going to organize it my way.  You like it, you 
come.  You don™t like it,
 it™s too bad.ﬂ  But 
until the end, she wants to be the boss. [Laughi
ng.] And she never coul d, because pr obably we 
were the same  way, you know?   But so the relati
on was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss 
her?   No.  And my mother was 
not a kisser.  One kiss a week wa
s the top, no more.  So she stay 
in her, in her back, and I stay, and my other br
other, Gaston, is– it was, is and was a very funny 
character.  He looks good and it was enough for him. 
 So, he  was thinking more to buy nice suit, 
nice thing.  And when I came back he was a 
growing ma n and you know, he didn™t want to 
bother with me .  I was t he little boy.
  So, the relation was short.

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: Okay, this is an interview with Dr. Paul
 Pressman, a continuation.  It™s now August 17
th
, 1999, 
continuing our interview from July.  And this is 
tape number three, side A.  I wondered when I 
was looking over the notes.  I took some , listened to 
the interview that we did last time  and I took 
some  notes on things that we had talked about, and one thing which stood out, that I didn™t ask 
you about was, I wondered how you felt... you were 
talking about your mother™s role in the 

resistance and discovering that sh
e was actually a fighter or  a capta
in in the resistance move me nt  
and that she showed you this gun that she kept 
hidden in this book.  And I wondered how that 
effected your view of your mother and how, whet
her that mo me nt was significant to you in some  
way?  
 

A: Not specifically, because I thi
nk I knew my mot her since a long 
time, since I was very little, I 
mean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have
 very serious question to ask to each other.  
And I think basically we didn™t, 
I didn™t have, she didn™t have a
ny secret from me , so I was not 
surprised and not shocked to see what she was do
ing.  And she was doing this very naturally.  I 
mean, she didn™t show off.  It was what she was 
doing and that™s all.  But it was not some thing... 

a big surprise for me .  I never been afraid
 of gun.  I never been excited over gun, but I 
understood.  The question... it was no question in
 my mi nd.  It was a normal way of life, 
knowing what she was doing before.  And it was, to me , a norma l situation. 
 

Q: Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that–? 

 

A: Before she used to go, at the time  when she wa
s in Grenoble, in south of France, she used to go 
and bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in 
the hospital.  And those people were guarded by 
German.  And she always found a way to go in, bri
ng what she did have to bring.  She did a lot 
of risky things, but the natural way.  So, know
ing this, after this, know
ing she was carrying a 
gun, didn™t surprise me .   
 

Q: The reason that I noticed it a
nd that I asked you about it, one r
eason was that the gun, the issue of 
your experiences with a gun came up a couple of 
times during the interv
iew yesterday.  You 
talked about the one time that, or
 not yesterday but earlier, you ta
lked about the one time  Pastor 
Lederman got angry at you was when he saw 
you playing with his gun.  And then you talked 
about that other incident with your mother.  A
nd then you me ntioned also that you feel safer if 
you have a gun now.  And that was some thing 
you didn™t talk about 
on tape.  And I was 
wondering if you would 
talk about that? 
 

A: Well, it took me  a long time  be fore I could trai
n myself.  I have now thirty year of ma rtial art 
behind me .  I always felt in general, the Jewish
 people don™t like gun, don™t like to fight.  I me an 
I speak about the Jewish people in France.  And 
it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish 

people in the world when we found out Israelian sold
ier were one of the best in the world.  And I 
was not surprised, I was happy a
bout, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun 
with Jewish people they don™t like
 it.  Jewish people in genera
l are not fighter, unless you go in 
Israel and they did what they did.  And this is 
why I always felt very secure, and when I was with 
my godfather in Switzerland, I did lik
e to have this gun close to me .  But it was very hard for me  
to explain to him why.  I always felt like if 
anything happened, ma ybe I™m going to die, but I™m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
30
 
 
  
30
going to defe nd myself.  I don™t want to die like a 
poor animal.  I want to die, but before I™m 
going to die, some body e l se is going to die, too.  
It was my feeling since a long time.  I was in 
very big contradiction with my brothers, but so
me thing I have to say... even I knew my  father 
very little, my father used to
 carry all the time a gun.  I didn™t 
know why and I couldn™t ask the 
question, because I don™t think he would answer, 
but this is some thing I reme mber.  And ma ybe 
it™s because of this I always... But basically in 
my mi nd I think the reason I always like gun is 
because gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead.   
 

Q: Did your father carry a gun before the war, too?    

 

A: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.   

 

Q: So that meant when you saw your mother with a gun it wasn™t so unusual, because you had 
already seen your father with a gun and it wa
s some thing you were used to having around. 
 

A: Exactly.  Because my mother never touch gun befo
re.  I never saw, before the war, my mother 
with a gun.  But when I saw her with a gun, it ma ke
s sense to me.  From where we come... it™s 
funny because we were four, five brot her and we 
were so different.  The only one I know the 
best is the one who stay alive now. 
 And he is so different, like I sa
id in the tape before and he™s 
not a fighter.  He™s a good ma n.  
He™s not a fighter, and the only 
reason he came  back is because 
he was lucky.  And you can– you know, in front 
of so ma ny SS or Nazi in the camp, you don™t 

have a... if they decide to kill you, they will kill 
you anytime they want.  So when he came back, 
he came back because he was lucky.  But my brothe
r was not a fighter and I am a fighter.  Like I 
told him ma ny time, if I was in
 a camp, if they took me  in 
Auschwitz, I wouldn™t survive an 
hour.  They would kill me  right away.  But the sa
me idea, they would kill me, but I would kill 
some body before I die.   
 

Q: Do you ever feel critical of 
those who didn™t struggle enough?   Th
ere™s been a lot 
a criticism of 
Jews during the Holocaust, that 
they didn™t struggle enough.   
 

A: Well, it™s always– was bad feeling for me , to s
ee, like when in Paris th
ey put together all the 
Jew in one big field, closed completely.  It was 
hard for me  later, to understand why they didn™t 
do some thing.  Why didn™t they organize?   The only
 time they organized themselves and most of 
them time it was Polish Jew, it was in the ghetto of Warsaw.  This is where they organi ze, they 

fight, because they say die for die.  We going to 
fight.  But in France, no, because again we come  
back to the same idea, all the Jewish people 
from France said, ﬁI™m not Jewish, I™m French, 
Jewish is my religion,ﬂ which was true on the 
basic.  But the German said, ﬁNo, you Jew.  
French Jew, German Jew, Italian Je
w, you are Jew, you have to die.ﬂ   
 

Q: And along those lines, you also me ntioned last time that befo
re the war and ma ybe during the 
war too, you thought of yourself that way, as a 
French person and then as a Jew.  And I™m 
wondering when that switched 
that you really felt like, no 
I™m not French, I™m Jewish? 
 

A: Well, everything changed when I saw they arrest everybody, young, old people.  And they arrest 
them just because they were Jew.  And to me  it 
didn™t make any sense.  This is when I start to 
realize, I™m not French, I™m not 
American, I™m not Russian, I™m Jew.  This is the only reason.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
31
 
 
  
31
I™m born Jew, so they want to kill me , that™s all.
  Like I told you before, look up to this day, what 
happened last week.  This guy, who did go in Calif
ornia and kill Jew just because he doesn™t like 
Jew.  And this is when I said to the Ameri
can Jew, ma ybe you are an Ame r ican, but before 
everythi ng you are Jewish.  And they are going to kill you, not because you are an American, 

because you are Jew. 
 

Q: Have you ever gotten into trouble with any people,
 with any American Jews by telling them that?   
I mean you have a very strong opinion about it
 and some  people mi ght have strong... Do you 
ever get into arguments? 
 

A: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time, be cause
 number one, I don™t go to the synagogue.  I don™t go 
to the Temple.  I, like I say to a lot of Jew,
 I™m Jewish by tradition.  I™m not Jew by religion.  
And when we speak about, I mean the way the 
Jewish people are here, they ma ke it easy for 

them.  They separate the traditional Jew, the Refo
rmed Jew, and for me this make less sense than 
the rest of it.  But sure, they don™t... when 
I arrive here in the 
beginning, I did go to the 
synagogue to explain what was life in Europe. 
 And a lot of people we
re laughing because they 
thought I was telling story.  So, I quit going and th
ey ask me  why I don™t join synagogue.  And I 

said, I never join synagogue in France, why shoul
d I join a synagogue here on top of this?   This 
for me  is not a synagogue.  This is a joke.  You 
know, Saturdays is the Shabbat.  Saturday Jewish 

people don™t touch mone y, so we hire Catholic pe
ople to play the music, to clean the place, 
because we cannot work, because we cannot sing, 
it™s against the law of the Jewish Torah.  It 
doesn™t ma ke sense. 
 

Q: And when you said that pe
ople here, when you talked about your time in Europe and they 
thought you were telling stories, were you talki
ng about the Holocaust  years or afterwards? 
 
A: Holocaust, the way they arrest us, the way, ev
en up to this day, you don™t say you™re Jewish.  
Well, my na me  is Pressman, Pressman in France 
is Jewish.  Goldma n, Pellman, this is Jewish.  
People ask me , well Pressman is Ge rman?   I say no, 
this is a Jewish name.  But we have to be 
careful even up to this day.  And I don™t speak
 about Germa ny.  If you go to Germany and your 
name  is Pressman, they don™t speak to you.  And 
a lot of people said to me  when I was in 
Europe, they say, ﬁOh, this is finished.ﬂ  A
nd one day, a guy did go to Germany, Jewis h ma n and 
he said openly to people, you know, ﬁI™m Jewish.ﬂ 
 Nobody talked to him after all.  They didn™t 
want to have anything to do with him.   Anti-Sem
itism in Ger many is as st rong as it is now as it 
was before, the same  way. 
 

Q: We left off l a st time  whe r e the war had ende
d and you went back from Switzerland to Paris and 
you rejoined you mother and your br
other, Gaston, and eventually your other brother, Be rnard.  
And you didn™t have time to tell in detail about
 what happened from there.  So, but you did 
me ntion briefly that you moved into your aunt™s apartment, who had been killed at Auschwitz.  

Can you talk about those, trying to
 reconstruct your a
nd rebuild your life toge
ther in those few 
months after the war, in Paris? 
 

A: Well we came  back, we  got together... This is wher
e, like I told you the last
 time , my  brother, we 
found out he came back from Auschwitz.  So, he wa
s alive.  And we got the apartment, which 
was a very small apartment.  It was a two room 
a partment for my aunt.  And we did go in and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
32
 
 
  
32
start to try to get back the apar
tment we used to have before we
 left.  And we got it back.  My 
father was an upholsterer and he di
d have a factory, very small, but
 a little factory.  We got it 
back, too. 
 
Q: What was the name  of it ?   Sorry to interrupt. 

 

A: Youmean–? 

 

Q: The factory that your father owned. 

 

A: His name  was Joseph Pressman, underneath it wa s 
Tapissier
.  Upholsterer.  And it was in the 
same  street where we did have this apartment.
  So my brother, who came  from Auschwitz, who 

did have a lot of training with my father, did 
reopen this and start to work again.  And I was 
thirteen years old and I did go back to school, co
llege.  And when I graduate from college, my 
brother wants for me  to go and work w
ith him on the _______________.  And I said, ﬁNo, I 
want to study me dicine.ﬂ  This was the joke of
 the day, because why should I become  a doctor?  
What– so, my brother, like I said, 
is a nice ma n, tried to help me  
as much as he could.  And he 
helped me , but basically the whole family, cut a 
little bit between them and I, because what I 
would like to do, it was silly.  For them it didn™t 
make any sense.  The only time they realize it 
was true, is when I graduate from medical school.  
And they said, ﬁWell, he did it, with no help.ﬂ  
I was working at night, and I 
was doing a lot of job.  And dur
ing the day I did go to medical 
school.  And when I graduate, everybody was 
very happy and we celebrate.  And meantime 
before I graduate, I got ma rried with a Catholic 
girl, not Jewi sh.  This didn™t help mi ne relation 
with my fa mily.  I got a little 
girl at the time and I was twenty-three years old.  And I raised my 
little girl.  I did have, like I sa
id, a lot of job, but I was ma king
 a good living.  And when it was, I 
think it was, I practice for about 
three, four year in Paris and I 
decide I want to learn about the 
mechanic of the body.  And this is where I came 
and find out about United State and Harvard, it 
was a special course for the mechanic of th
e body.  And I came by myse
lf for two or three 
weeks.  And this is where I found out, some body told me  about chiropractic.  So, I did go to 

Davenport, Iowa, where I saw what was chiropractic
.  I didn™t know.  I didn™t have any idea.  
And the first time I saw about chiropractic, I said
 ﬁThose people are crazy.  Doesn™t ma ke any 
sense,ﬂ
 
you know, the spine, give an adjustme nt.  And 
before I left they give me  a book, which I 
have even up to this day.  And I did go back to Fr ance, read the book and I said, ﬁGosh, this 

ma kes sense to me .ﬂ  So, I pack up all my thing, took my wife  and daughter and came to the 

United State and did go to Davenport, Iowa, 
where they give me  credit.  And I study 
chiropractic, graduate in 1962.  And came back to Fran
ce in Paris and opened an office in Paris.  
And I start to practice me
dicine and chiropractic. 
 

Q: Let™s sl ow down, because I want to ge t some  mo
r e details about just th
e time  i mmediately after 
the war before we go on.  Wa s it, so you were staying in your aunt™s house 
for just a little while 

before you moved?   Is that right? 
 

A: Maybe I would say a couple year, 
or ma ybe less.  But it was not l
ong.  It was very hard to live, 
three men and my mother in a two room.  It was...

33
Q: And were you surrounded by your aunt™s things, 
who had been killed?   That must have been 
strange. 
 
A: No, nothing was left.  They, you know, people 
stole everything.  No, it was nothing inside. 
 

Q: How did you feel as a Jewish person, survivor 
of the Holocaust, living in
 Paris imme diately after 
the war?  
 

A: It was a inside revolu
tion on me , but I, I™m, how can I say?  I™
m very me a n, if I want to, or I can 
ignore everything if I want to.  
And I thought I didn™t want to be
 the fighter against the... like 
Don Quixote.  And I said, ﬁIt™s not going to bring 
me  nothing.  I better build my life, chose what 
I want to do and just go on.ﬂ  For the time being 
after the war, there were no danger anymore.  
So I didn™t think about the Holocaust, all the dead, 
why they die, how they die.  Because of my 
brother I knew a lot of things from i nside.  But 
I did try to be in a neut
ral position.  I didn™t want 
for this to affect me .  I register
ed the whole thing, but 
I put this aside and say I will bring it back 
when the time  is going to be there.  I don™t 
know how other people do, but this was my way of 
doing.  So, I™m not going to be bitter.  I™m not goi
ng to be all the time  hungry, not hungry, angry. 
 

Q: Angry? 

 

A: Mad.  I don™t, I don™t think– I didn™t want to forg
ive.  At this time I didn™t know the technique 
of forgiving.  But I knew it was some thing I can 
do about this, but I was not ready to do it, 
because I didn™t know what to do and how to do it. 
 And like I said, my brother gi ve us a lot of 
information, what happen to the camp.  They was 
some fight, not fight, but my brother said a lot 
of secret things from the camp.  And one day, my
 mother did repeat some thing he asked her not 
to speak about to anybody.  And a group of attorney 
call my brother to ask hi
m, did he say this?   
And my brother said, ﬁYes, but I want to 
know how do you know? ﬂ   And they found out and 

they say the truth, ﬁYour mother 
said it.ﬂ  And I was there when 
he came back and he say to my 
mother, I ever going to speak to you anymore about th
is, and if we have to go to court because of 
what I told you, I will deny everythi ng.  And 
I™m going to tell you, you a liar.  Because what 
happened in camp, have nothing to do with thisworld.  I told you this because you my mother, 

but I don™t try to... he said, ﬁI
 don™t try to protect anybody.  Bu
t you cannot judge us.ﬂ  And 
h mmm, to me it makes sense. 
 

Q: What was it that he 
told her?   Do you know? 
 

A: It was– it was some thing bad, because the guy 
was alive.  And– and I mean, he survived, he 
did some thing very... you know, a piece of bread in
 camp is a question of life or death.  And 
when you say this now, what is a 
piece of bread?  We ll, you got this
 piece of bread, you survive.  
You don™t have this piece of bread, you die. 
 So, who are you people, to judge us, because 
some body st ole a piece of bread off of some body who 
was dying?   Any way he will di e.  So the 
guy... and nobody said anything.  And he explained this
 to my mother, but she shouldn™t repeat 
this thing.  Because... and this wa
s a little thing, you know... I mean– 
 

Q: So, the lawyers got involved because... 
why?   Wh y did the lawyers get involved?  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
34
 
 
  
34
A: Because it was Jewish lawyer and most of 
them came back from Auschwitz, but they been in 
Auschwitz for ma xi mu m a year, which was nothing.  But when they came  back, you know, they 
want to show, ﬁ We are lawyer, now we going to
 judge people who were mean, bad in camp.ﬂ  
Because if you know the story about the camp, the 
German, the SS were very, very few.  Let™s 
say in a camp of two thousand Jew, there were fi
ft een SS in uniform and t hey give order.  They 
say, ﬁYou are the Kapo of this room.  There is 
two hundred people here.  You are responsible.ﬂ  
You say, ﬁI don™t want toﬂŠBoom.  ﬁYou are go
ing to be the Kapo, you don™t want to be... so 
you are responsible of this two hundred people. 
 Tomorrow morning I want
 ten Jew on the floor 
dead.  I don™t care the way you do it.ﬂ  So.   
 

Q: Did you have, did your relationshi
p with your brother Bernard cha
nge very much after the war, 
after he had been through thes
e experiences in Auschwitz?   
 

A: No, it didn™t change because I didn™t know hi m 
very well.  He™s much, I mean, you know, he™s 
older than I.  I didn™t have, until
 I think it was two years ago, he got
 an interview in Paris from a 
French television.  And he give me  a tape and I 
came  here and I listen to the tape and I was so 

surprised.  I thought I knew my brother, but I di
dn™t know him.  And I don™t judge him, but we 
are so different.  He takes things one way.  I told
 him one day, ﬁI think yo
u are a Buddhist.ﬂ  And 
he said, ﬁWhy? ﬂ  I say, ﬁBecause Buddhist is not 
a religion, it is a way of life.  And Buddhist 

look on the fl oor and behind what he see on the floor
 and the rest he doesn™t see.  The only thing 
is what is on the floor, that™s all.  And this is why you survive.ﬂ  Because the tape he wa s doing, 

the interview he did on the French
 television, I thought to myself, 
we didn™t live with the same  
parent.  It wa s, you know, he was telling, we di d 
have a norma l life.  Sure, we felt anti-Semitism 
around us, but it was not so bad.  And I said to my
self, we didn™t lead the same  life.  We didn™t 
go to the same  school and we didn™t see the same 
thing.  So, I did go see friend of our age, my 
age, his age, and I ask question.  He said, ﬁNo, your
 brother is different.  
He™s a very sweet guy.  
He™s a good ma n, but he see things completely diffe
rent.ﬂ  I spend my Christmas with him, the 
last Christma s, ‚98, ‚99.  And 
I did something.  I spoke with 
him for an hour and I trying to 
explain to him, how, what is t
echnique of forgiveness.  He was ma d.  He was so ma d.  And I 
said, ﬁUnderstand, forgiveness is not to forgive what
 they did, it™s just to
 save yourself.  When 
you forgive them, at least you can breathe a litt
le bit.  Right now, every night you cry, you 
scream, because you are in the camp  now.  If you forgive, let them worry about their problem, 

but get rid of it.ﬂ  What did I say?   So, he
 send me, even two weeks ago he send me  a book I 
couldn™t find here.  And it is in French.  I like to 
read in French.  And on the side he wrote, ﬁTry 
to understand why I cannot forgive.ﬂ  We  have 
two different way of thinking and until the last 
mi nute of hi s life he is going to cry and be ma d, but
 he doesn™t want to.  He
 doesn™t want to help 
himself.  This is his life.

Tape 3, Side B 
 
Q: Okay, this is tape three, side B.  Whe n you 
say the technique of forgiveness and learning about 
the technique of forgiveness, what do you mean? 
 

A: When I was in France, on my spare time  when
 I was a student of me di
cine, I learn hypnosis.  I 
was very interested in hypnosis.  I put a la
dy through surgery under hypno
sis.  And you have a 
lot of technique.  And mainly th
is technique of forgiveness, 
which I didn™t know before and I 
was very happy to learn and practice this firs
t on me .  Every time I was mad at some body or 
things I didn™t like, I did try 
to forgive the people I was speak
ing, I mean not openly, but in my 
mi nd.  And this way it was easy for me to be able
 to discuss with people.  Some  people have a 

natural way of being patient.  I™m not patient, so
 I did want to find some
thing who is not going to 
make me pat i ent, but ma ke me a normal human 
being.  And those technique of forgiveness is 
so– we hear this in the Catholic religion.  Fo
rgive and God will forgive you.  I always say to a 

lot of people, I don™t need any church because if I 
have a pr oblem, I speak with God directly.  It 
is fifty percent joke and fi fty percent true, it goes together.  Because another human being like 

me , ah, how intelligent he  can be?   What can he do 
with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do 
it?   And this forgiveness came b
ack to me .  And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the 
teacher said, ﬁToday we™re going to speak only ab
out forgiveness.ﬂ  And I thought, God, this is 
great, and I learned every 
bit of it.  And I practice this with 
me and with my patient.  And it was 
wonderful, because people used to say, ﬁI didn™
t think this way before, but now it ma ke it so 
easy.ﬂ  And I thought to myself, 
I know, because I practice the same
 way for myself.  The more I 
can forgive things, easy my life is, and I come  back
 always to the point zero.  If you let, if you do 
a mi stake and you go too far with this mi stake, it™s
 very... longer you keep with, harder it is to 
come  back.  So, try to rectify the mi stake as s
oon as you can, so this way it™s going to be much 
easier to work on it and it™s going 
to be quicker.  So they teach
 you every time at night before 
you, when you go to bed, before you go to sleep, tr
y to go very fast on your day and say, ﬁOkay 
what happened today?   What 
did I do that was not good? ﬂ
 
 So you try to forget yourself by being 
sorry and said ﬁI™m not going to do this any more.  I™m going to try to be better,ﬂ and also vice 

and versa, one way or another way.  It™s amazing th
e way it works.  It™s some thing very simple.  
The only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it™s perf
ect.  If you don™t want to 
do it, it™s very hard.  
And this is why, I try.  I stay about two weeks w
ith my brother.  I said, ﬁBernard, I™m sorry.  
You™re going to be ma d, if you want to throw me
 out from your house, you do it.  But every day 
I™m going to speak to you about forgiveness, beca
use this is your only savior.ﬂ  But he laugh, he 
became red some ti me , he left the room, he took witness, friend.  Okay, he took friend who 

thought like him.  And you know, 
if you ask a friend, after all the story of the camp, he survive 
and he say, ﬁBloing 
(ph)
, face to face, can I forgive this?ﬂ  
People say, ﬁNo.ﬂ  But this is not 
what I ask him.  I don™t ask him to forgive this wa
y.  I want for him to forgive them their fault, 
they are the worst people.  He is not a bad ma n.  
So forgive them for what they di d to them and 
to you.  But it was– I don™t th
ink... maybe I put a little some th
ing on the ground, but for him it 
is too late.  And I think, it™s not 
nice what I™m going to say, but I 
think also he en
joy a little bit 
his situation.   
 

Q: Enjoys being angry? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
36
 
 
  
36
A: No.  He enjoy to be, people feel sorry for him.  
And he likes this.  I think so.  But ther e is a lot of 
point I cannot clarify with him, 
because I don™t want to be pushy.  And he™s not going to tell me  
anyway, because at the same  ti me  wi th him, Maur
ice was with him.  And Maurice die when they 
were in Auschwitz.  So– 
 
Q: Does he feel guilty about that? 

 

A: We cannot speak about that, so I cannot be
 pushy, because–  The only thing I know, the only 
little thing, and he cannot hide th
is, because he said it.  You know, when you say some thing, it™s 
very hard to retract.  When they arrive in Au
schwitz, I don™t reme mber the date, but they shave 
every ma n and woma n.  And they put them in a bi
g room.  And it was not 
very light, it was very 
dark.  And one mo ment he was walking and he turn around and he sees this guy on his back all 

the time .  And he say, ﬁWhy do you follow me  all 
the time like this?ﬂ  And he said, ﬁBut I™m 
Maurice, I™m your brother.ﬂ  He didn™t recognize 
him.  He was– and for me , my interpretation 
is, he was already gone.  He put a wall.  Not 
because... because the situation.  He said, ﬁOkay, 
save your life.  I save mi ne.ﬂ  This is the way 
I felt it and this is the way I understood.  Maybe 
I™m wrong.  I don™t know.  But this is the way I 
feel it.  Because in any situation if you don™t 
recognize your brother, your sister
, your mother, it™s like what I sa
id before.  Looks on the floor, 
ﬁEverything here is mi ne, after th
is, I have nothing to do with it.ﬂ 
 

Q: Was it difficult for you to– you talked about how 
e mpowering it was to lear
n this technique of 
forgiveness.  Was it real ly diffi cult to get to 
that point where you™re 
forgiving not only people 
within your own life, but a
pplying it to this larger situation of the Holocaust? 
 

A: Even– even now it™s hard.  It™s not– it™s not easy.  It™s not easy to forgive.  You can forgive 
little things.  But when it becomes so important, 
it™s not easy.  Because you have to visualize, 
and I™m good,  I know how to visualize.  And when you see the whole picture... a month ago I 

read about this ma n in United State, who help
 people to die.  I don™t remember his name .  
Cavajohn, some thing like this. 
 

Q: Kevorkian. 

 

A: Kevorkian.  Some body ask him, doe
s n™t he feel like a Nazi by 
doing this.  And I don™t judge.  I 
don™t judge him.  This would be another discussi
on.  But they ask him, he doesn™t feel like a 
Nazi?   And he said, ﬁWhat the Nazi did to the Je
wish people did help other people after the war.ﬂ  
Meaning I don™t like what the me dicine does w
ith rats, with animal, the experience they do, 
because I don™t agree on this.  But when you judg
e human being to do experience like rat, there 
is no end.  I don™t know why he said this and what
 is the basic idea.  Maybe one day I am going 
to have the chance to speak with him.  Bu
t what did he mean by this?   In Germany, 
Der Spiegel
 
did an article of a doctor, who was a doctor in 
the camp Auschwitz.  He™s alive now.  They ma de 
an interview and they asked the question, ﬁDo 
you feel guilty about what you did? ﬂ  Be cause 

they did horrible experience.  And he said, 
ﬁNo, I did my job.ﬂ  And people said, ﬁWhat do you 
mean by your job? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI was military.  They
 put me in a camp, but I save a lot of Jew.  I 
kill a lot, but I save a lot.  A
nd everything we did, helped for this generation.ﬂ  So, the question 

is, is he guilty?  Is he not guilty?  He sleeps every day.  He doesn™t have any problem.  Is a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
37
 
 
  
37
norma l human being able to sleep after killing 
healthy children, woma n a
nd ma n?   It™s a big 
question. 
 
Q: Do you have any answers for it? 

 

A: No, no, no.  Because I found out in any case, it™s
 very hard to put your
self in some body else 
body on a case like this.  What would I do, if as a 
Jewish doctor, put him in a camp.  What would 
I do?   What road would I take?  
 I don™t know.  I want to surv
ive?  ŠMaybe.  I don™t want to 
survive like a killer, I die.  But 
what would be my position?   I don™t know.  I don™t ha ve any idea.  
It™s hard.  
 

Q: Do you remember when you fi
rst realized that you had a 
deep interest in me dicine? 
 

A: From long time, when I was nine years old, I was 
very interested of the– 
and I won™t say to save 
people, but just of the science of me dicine, of
 the huma n being.  I™m, I don™t think I™m such a 
good ma n to say it was to save people.  I don™t th
ink so.  But I was interested on how the body is 
ma de, why does the body react the 
way it is?  And this is why I did go to acupuncture, because 
acupuncture made me discover alo
t of things I didn™t know.   
 

Q: Do you remember any significant mome nts when 
you realized that?   Some
thing that happened to 
you that ma de you say, ﬁAh, I rea
lly want to study thisﬂ? 
 

A: No, no, because I™m a bad student.  So every time  you said the word when I was young, about 
studying, go to school and buy book and read book... I 
said, ﬁOh, I™m not going to do it.ﬂ  But I 
did it because I was interested on me dicine.  Bu
t I was not interested on... my average, medical 
school, every school I did go was between seventy-
eight and eighty.  I ne
ver ma de a hundred.   
 

Q: When did you, so in the time after the war 
when you were in France and you were attending 
school again, did you have the– how long did it ta
ke before you had the idea that you wanted to 
become a doctor and do you re
me mb er how that happened? 
 

A: Like I said, I was nine years old when I said, 
I will be a doctor.  And all my  path was on this 
direction.  But you know, when you are nine year
s old... I have a patient, who came , a woma n, 
came with a little boy.  And very, very wealthy people.  It was in Paris.  And the boy was ma ybe 

five or six years old.  And I said, ﬁWhat do you want
 to become  when you are to be older?ﬂ  And 
he said, ﬁI want to drive a garbage truck.ﬂ  A
nd I said, ﬁWhy a garbage truck?ﬂ  And he gave me  
a good, very interesting e
xplanation.  And much 
later, I found out he 
was driving a garbage 
truck.  He was eighteen, nineteen.  Some time 
you don™t know what drives you, why you want to 
do some thing and this is when I say God is so 
strong.  Because some time s God say, he wants to 
be a garbage driver, let it be.  And he open ev
ery door he can.  And the guy is very happy.  We  
need people drive truck, drive garb
age truck.  We  need fire people.  We  ne ed policeme n.  So, 
why not?   The funny part is, every time I... I us
ed to take anybody who wants to have hypnosis, 
they want to know what they were in anothe
r life.  Because everybody think they were king, 

queen, princess, you know?   But I said to the 
people, ﬁYou know, there was a few King, but the 
ma jority were people working.  Wh y don™t you 
think you™d be a norma l huma n body working to 
ma ke a living?   You have more people who ma
ke  eighteen, twenty thousand a year in United 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
38
 
 
  
38
State than people who ma ke a hundre
d fifty thousand.  But in another life, you want to be the one 
who ma ke a hundred and fifty thousand? ﬂ  [Laughing.]   
 
Q: What was it... have you alwa
ys believed in God?    

 

A: Always, always.  God was always there with me .  
I have to, I have to be 
very, very honest.  And 
if he didn™t have the time, he send me some body to
 help me .  So I never, never worry about, and 
even now, dying.  Dying for me  is a norma l end.  The same  way when you believe in 

reincarnation, you know what is to be born again.  And in the same  ti me , when the time  come s, 

it™s the end.  And say, I don™t know the word in E
nglish– wise Indian, native from United State, 
they know exactly when they are going to die.  Th ey say good-bye to all the fa mily.  They go to 

the mountain, they pray God and they die.  The fa
mily come  the day or two days after, take the 
body and burn it, because this is the ritual.  Now, 
people said, ﬁI don™t want  
to die.ﬂ  Why?   If it 
is the time, it™s the time.  You got a ticket in 
your pocket.  You have your
 date of birth and you 
have a blank.  The blank is when you die.  Ok
ay, suddenly the date goes 
on, it™s this day.  And 
go on.  [Laughing.] 
 

Q: Can you describe your... this is going to be 
a difficult question, I think.  Ca n you describe what 
you think of when you think of God?   What do you think when you say, I™ve always believed in 

God?   What does God represent 
to you?   What does it mean? 
 

A: Very complicated to say.  Some time, some ti
me  to ma ke it easy on me , it™s a body.  I speak with 
some body, but some time  when I sleep... this is the real one, the real McCoy, because it come s 

like a voice.  And in the morn
ing, it happened to me  not long time ago, I don™t know if it was a 

dream or did I see it, did I wake
 up?   It™s very, very funny, but 
one thing I can tell you, it™s very 
comforting.  I mean, I never been scared.  I never 
been afraid because I heard some thing or I saw 
some thing.  Lately, lately, I live al
one here, lately I see things pa
ssing.  Or  I™m in the kitchen and 
I see a blur of some thing.  
Pfft.
  So, I say to myself jokingly, ma ybe soon it™s my time .  And it™s 
possible.  And it™s going to come .  So, now, late
r... but it™s funny, becaus
e lately I see, maybe 
you are going in a few month or a few weeks, you
™re going to hear, ﬁWell, he pass away.ﬂ  You 
got this on your tape saying, ﬁ Well, he spoke ab
out it.ﬂ  And it™s nothing to be scared of it.  
When come the time, come the time.  You know 
people die forty years old.  I™m sixty-seven.  I 
did have a good life with the good 
and the bad, but it™s nothing, you know.  I don™t want to live 
until a hundred and twenty with nothing, with Al
zheime r or thinking about how a m I going to 
survive, or– God is wise, he knows when to tell
 you to come  back.  And if me dicine is strong 
enough to keep you alive, this is ridiculous.  
Wh en somebody has to go, let him go.  The best 
way, but let him go.  And when it™s your time, it™s tim
e.  It™s nothing to be scared of it.  I be 
back.  [Laughing.]   
 

Q: So, you™re, tell me  if this is right.  Your G
od, your idea of God or your perception of what God is 
ma ybe partially come s from your Jewish traditio
n, but partially come s fr
om your own instinctive 
sense.  And then ma ybe from ot
her religious traditions, too?    
 

A: From the little I know about the Je wish religion, Je
wish people, when  they die, it™s fini shed.  
There is a God, but reincarnation, Je
wish people don™t believe in it.

Q: Except for Hasidic Jews.  And I don™t know if modern Hasidic Jews do. 
 

A: But the old basic religion, when 
you die, that™s it.  It™s finished. 
 I don™t think this come from the 
Jewish religion.  On top of this, 
I don™t have any training with th
e Torah.  Never read the Torah.  
Never read the Talmud.  I don™t have any knowledge
 about the Jewish religion, neither from any 
other religion.  Everything is by feeling.  And 
God is always present.  When you do good thing.  
When you do bad things.  Some time s it™s a little 
bit annoying to have this presence with you.  
When, when you have sex, you want to be alon
e.  [Laughing.]  You don™t want to have 
some body who look over your shoulder, but it goes with
 the price.  But yes, I have a relation 
mostly constantly.  I™m not going to, you™re not go
ing to see me  in the streets screaming ﬁI saw 
God!ﬂ  No.  But I have a feeling.  I have this feel
ing.  It™s very comfortable.  It ma kes sense to 
me , and it™s very helpful.  Because if I go back from my childhood until now, God wa s very 

good with me, because he  never let me  down.  I 
never got, I've been depressed like a lot of 

people, but I got some thing who just come  back
 in there, ﬁHey Paul, get up, that™s it.ﬂ
 
 And it™s 
true.  I can have a few bad days and after this 
the sun come s back and everything is okay.  So, 
I™ve been very lucky, I mean sp
iritually.  And I don™t want to 
say this too much... I did have, 
when I was in France, I did have a lot of priest
 comi ng in my office.  The reason is, my wife 

brother was a monk and he send me a lot of people
, because I did have a lot of success.  And if 
you want me, I can tell you a shor
t story.  One of mi ne patient 
was from Paris and his brother 
was a 
monsignor
 in Rome.  He said, ﬁYou think this guy, 
you know, this doctor, can help me ? ﬂ   
He was in bad, bad shape.  And his brother, who 
lives in Paris said, ﬁLet me  ask hi m. ﬂ  So, the 
monsignor calls me  and he said, ﬁIf I send you the 
plane from the Pope and I pay all the expense 
and you tell me  your price, would you come  for 
a weekend at the Vatican
?ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYes, 
but you have to reme mb er one thing, I™m born fr om 
Jewish parent.ﬂ  He sa
id, ﬁGod is Jewish.ﬂ  I 
said, ﬁIf you take it this way, any time  you want
, any weekend.ﬂ  So, he send me  a plane and did 
go there, took care of him.  And he s how me  my
 room and on the top of, above the bed was the 
Christ.  And I said, ﬁYou have to take this out
, because, you know, as Jewish, you tell me I kill 
him and trust me, I didn™t kill him.  And I don™t th
ink Jewish people did.ﬂ  So, he took it away.  
We did have wonderful discus
sion.  And when I came back, you 
know, he was very, very happy.  
We spend beautiful hour of discussion.  And he
 said, ﬁIf one day you have the vocation and 

God...ﬂ because we spoke about God and I told h
im my relation with God.  And he say, ﬁIf God 
ask you to become  a Catholic, would you accept?ﬂ  
And I said, ﬁIf God ask me , yes I will.  But 
Monsignor, I™m going to tell you one thing, ma ybe
 it™s going to be a Catholic, one more 
Catholic, but I will be Jew for the rest of my lif
e.ﬂ  And he said, ﬁI think so.ﬂ  [Laughing.]   
 

Q: How did you gain such a 
reputation for your practice? 
 

A: I think it™s mouth, people... I di
d have all kind of people come  in
 my office.  Movie actor, little 
people, farmer brought me  a chicken in a piece 
of paper in a Paris, 
in an office right in 
Madeleine, which is the best
 office you can find.  They brought me  cognac they did by 
themselves, like you call here moonshine.  I di d 
ha ve all kind of people.
  And I will tell you the 
truth, if you stay with me  here in my offi
ce when I™m working, you™ll see all kind of people 
come  in here.  Policemen, fireme n, fire people, 
ni nety-seven-year-old lad
y, ninety-two, this lady 
come s every two weeks.  She™s ninety-two.  Sh
e said, ﬁYou™re the only one who keep me  on my 
feet.  Please don™t go away before I die,ﬂ you know?
  Everywhere I™ve been, I did have all kind... 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

40
I don™t have a specific kind of patient.  I have a
ll kind.  And I like it this 
way, because it™s fun.  I 
speak with all kind of peopl
e.  It™s interesting. 
 
Q: When you were beginning to study me dicine, 
when you started going to medical school, were 
you pleased by what you were experiencing, wh
at you were learning?   Did it meet your 
expectations, and your hopes? 
 

A: Not at all.  No.  Medical 
school teach you the basic.  And when you out of school, you become  a 
doctor.  And the basic, even the way they practi
ce me dicine here in th
e United State, it™s not 
worse and it™s not better than 
any place else.  Wh en a guy put a stethoscope around his neck, his 
whole personality change.  It™s like a cop, when 
he put on a uniform, he™s  completely different.  
Take his unifor m out, take his stethoscope out,take him out of the hospital... I know doctor, you 

can see them in the street and you want 
to give them a penny to go buy a coke...

Tape 4, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number f
our, side A.  Say it again. 
 
A: The most i mportant is the people ego, who is im
portant.  It™s like bei
ng the president of United 
State, if you didn™t have the big e
go, who wants to be president of 
United State.  But doctor with 
big ego are completely diffe
rent.  They are not huma n. 
 

Q: So, did you learn anything that you 
found really useful in me dical school? 
 

A: Oh, yes, the basic, I mean you ha
ve to... it™s like, I like 
to play music and the best way to learn is 
to learn classic.  And after th
is, you can play any kind of instru
me nt you want because classical 
is so complete, so hard.  You want to play Ja
zz?   No problem.  You want to play song?  No 
problem.  Medicine, you have to learn the basi
c.  If you know how the ma chine works, you can 
do what you want after this.  What I don™t like to
o much in medicine, when people specialize.  
You know, you specialize on one thing and you do one
 thing only and you speak to this doctor 

about some thing else, he doesn™t know.  I do 
only stomach.  If you have a problem with your 
stomach, I know everything about stomach.  But the 
problem is, in the body, 
the stomach is part 
of the body.  Maybe the stomach doesn™t work, and th
is is why I did go in chiropractic.  Because 
with chiropractic I can do more than give me dicine.  And with acupuncture and chiropractic, I 

can do again more, because I can reach from every 
corner.  And this is why I feel muc h more 
secure with what I know now than when I grad
uate from me dical school
, which I didn™t know 
nothing. 
 

Q: And when you said, you talked a 
little bit about, about your, the 
word of mouth that went around 
and that you gained a reputation.  What was it 
that you were good at?   What was your particular 
aptitude?    
 

A: Patient likes to come  in front of a guy, who have 
the time  to listen, to sit down and say, ﬁ What is 
your problem? ﬂ   And because I know all those litt
le thing, I know what kind of question to ask.  
You know?   If you tell me  your problem and you 
go in some space in your body, I don™t want to 
know for ma ny reasons, I want to be
 more specific.  I bring you b
ack to the point, I want for you 
to be specific.  So, I can go there much easier 
than you said, ﬁWell, I have headache.  I™m very 
constipated.  When I get my pe
riod...ﬂ and I™m confused.  And when you confuse a doctor, he 
does nothing.  But when the doc
tor knows how to direct you: 
 ﬁOkay, you have this, let™s 
emphasize on this place.  When do you have this
 pain?   Where do you have this pain?  From 
where does it come ?   Wh at time  of the day?  
 How ma ny time a week do you have this? ﬂ   So, you 

can bring all this to one thing.  I put this 
with my knowledge of... I know if I™m going to put 
needle or I™m going to adjust your spine or I™
m going to give you some  light, natural me dication 
or the three of it at the same time
.  And people said, ﬁBut it™s a mi
racle.ﬂ  No, it™s not a mi racle.  
It™s knowledge.  And this is the way I trea
t you, not because it™s you, 
it™s because I treat 
everybody the same  wa y.  I would treat my brothe
r the same  way, my wi fe the same  way and 
you the same  way.  You don™t like the way I do, go 
see some body else.  But this is my way of 
doing.  If you came to see me , it™s because unt
il now you didn™t have any success with any 
doctor.  So, give me  a chance.

Q: You talked about when you started to discover 
chiropractic me dicine.  What exactly was it that 
captured your interest? 
 
A: Chiropractic?  Chiropractic is 
based on nerve pressure.  Everything come  from the brain.  Mine 
basic idea of psychosomatic is so strong.  You 
can help yourself or you can destroy yourself.  
There™s a doctor, I saw this on 
20/20
 not long time ago.  There™sa doctor, he must be around 
sixty-five years old in New Yor
k.  And he take care of any, any low back pain with a hundred 

percent success just by explaining thing for twenty
 mi nutes to the patient.  And I was listening 
to, I didn™t hear what he was 
saying for the twenty mi nute, but 
I understood the concept, and it 
ma kes sense.  And he is in a hospital and all th
e other doctor laugh at him, but he™s got a hundred 
percent success, because he teach you how to say when you wake up in the morning and you 

have pain on your back, and you say, ﬁOh honey, I th
ink I™m not going to be able to go to work.  
My pain kills me  and it™s going to be a horrible 
day.ﬂ  And if I can teach you how to speak to 
your backŠand this is what he doesŠsure it™s goi
ng to be hard to start,
 but little by little the 
pain is going to go away.  Everything, almost, is
 psychosomatic.  Cancer, and I don™t speak about 
HIV and sickness like this, which is acquired.  This
 is different.  But I mean any, anything inside 
of your body is psychosomatic.  You can ma ke it 
worse or you can ma ke  it better.  And if 
some body for any reason, you have a baby, find a doc
tor who is going to be
 with you all the 
time.  And if you have any problem, you be able to gi
ve him a call and said, ﬁI feel this and this,ﬂ 
and he should have an answer to tell you.  ﬁIt™s norm
al because of this or this or this, think this 
way and you™ll feel better.ﬂ  You have to have a di
alogue.  The doctor is here to help you, to help 
your psychic.  Everything is almost 99.5 percen
t psychosomatic.  And if
 the doctor understand 
this and can direct you... You know a  lot of pe
ople come  to acupuncture and said, ﬁI hate 
needle.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁIf I tell you, you are not going to feel it.ﬂ   Okay, I can tell this until 

tomorrow and if I put in a needle and it™s painfu
l, he™s going to say, ﬁYou lied to me .  It™s 
painful.ﬂ  But if the patient is
 on the table and I said, ﬁOkay, I™m
 going to put a needle.  As soon 
as there is any pain tell me.  I take the needle 
out.  But the wa y, I put th
e needle and where I put 
the needle, you shouldn™t feel nothi
ng.ﬂ  99 percent people say, ﬁI 
didn™t feel it.ﬂ  This is one 
for m of hypnosis: to do acupunctu
re.  ﬁ What did you do to me?ﬂ  Patient who come  bent and 
they have low back pain.  Put them on the tabl e, 
st art to ma ssage a little bit the back and speak to 

them, tell them about vacation.  What do you like, fl
ying, thing like this.  I ad
just them, if I didn™t 
speak to them, I couldn™t touch them.  You touch 
them a little bit: ﬁOh, it™
s painful.ﬂ  You put a 
little bit under hypnosis and give an
 adjustme nt and that™s it.  
And the patient goes away.  It 
looks simple the way I explain, but this is the wa
y it goes.  It™s very simple.  Unless I play the 
doctor, ﬁYou lay down here.  I™m going to adju
st you.  It™s going to be
 painful, but you have 
nothing for nothing.  You have to suffer.ﬂ  They sa
y, ﬁJust a mi nute, let me think about.ﬂ  It™s 
psychosoma tic, I mean, everything is in your hea
d.  ﬁI™m going to adjust you, but I don™t know if 
I going to help you.ﬂ  ﬁWell, so don™t t
ouch me . [Laughing.] Leave me  alone.ﬂ   
 

Q: You™re studying, you™re in me dical school studyi
ng western me dicine which has a very different 
approach than the one you™re de
scribing right now.  Wa s that difficult for you?   That you have a 
very unconventional approach? 
 

A: I didn™t have any problem for one reason.  I kno
w God is going to put me  in the right way, when 
it is the time.  So I was not worried.  And this is 
some thing else very important: is not to be rush 

by things.  Everything is going to be in time.  
Wh en I was very young, I want it now.  And every 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

43
time I did this, they spank me.  ﬁ Why did you sp
ank me ? ﬂ   ﬁBecause you are too nervous, take 
your time.  You™re going to get it.  Just a mi
nute.  Don™t worry.ﬂ  And this was hard, but you 

learn.  It™s always the same .  My father used to
 tell a story when he was in Russia.  He said, a 
guy did have a horse and it cost  him a lot of mone
y to feed him.  So, little by little this far mer 
start to feed him less and less and less, until one 
day he died, the horse.  And the farmer said, 
ﬁThis is too bad.  Just the day he 
was used to not to eat, he die.ﬂ  And for me  is the same  thing.  
When I™m going to be almost perfect, I™m going to
 go away.  Waste of time ?   No, it™s not a waste 
of time, bec a use it™s going to serve me  for my 
next... my teacher of acupuncture in China told 
me , ﬁPaul, it™s your first life as an acupuncturi
st.  You okay, but you not 
wonderful.  You need 
four life of acupuncture.  The fourth life, you™re goi
ng to be perfect.  And this is going to be the 
time, probably, you going to stay there.  You 
don™t come  back.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁIt™s very 
encouraging because I ha ve three more life to go.  Okay, let™s do it.ﬂ  [Laughing.] 
 

Q: When did you start getting interested in acupuncture? 

 

A: 1965.  I got this book, one of the very, very inte
resting doctor.  I don™t kn
ow how you call this.  
There is a group of Catholic docto
r and I even don™t reme mbe r  the name  in French.  They are in 
black and white.  The robe is black and white.  
This ma n is a very famous  fa mily.  And he 
became an M.D. and he want to learn acupunctu
re, but the only way to learn and write a book 
about acupuncture, he did have to learn Chinese. 
 So, he became  an M.D. for a big family in 
China.  He learned Chinese and he
 learn acupuncture.  And I have 
his book with me .  It was five, 
six year before I was born.  Born in 1932, so 
it was ‚25, 1925.  And he did a complete study of 
acupuncture.  And I read th
is book three time  and I said to a lo
t of people, if this house get in 
fire, the only thing I™m going to save  is this boo
k, because it™s got everything in it.  And I read 
the book and I said, ﬁIf I™m lucky maybe one day 
I™m going to study acupuncture.ﬂ  And I got a 
chance one day to go to Taiwan and I did go to th
e school.  I start my study, came  ba ck with all 
the books.  And since ‚65, let™s say I 
start to put needle in patient 
five year later.  And I still 
study acupuncture and I will study
 until the rest of my life. 
 

Q: What is it about it that 
interested you?   What did you 
read in that book, for example? 
 

A: The mystery.  Acupuncture is ve
ry mysterious.  Yesterday my a
ttorney call me  for a patient of 
mi ne.  They don™t understand why I adjust the neck of
 this patient and she™s got a low back pain.  
So, I say to my attorney, ﬁYou have two way, either you answer the way you want to this 

insurance company and you say what you want or you sue the company a nd I won™t charge you a 

penny to go to court.  Because if this people 
think I™m going to speak to them on the telephone 

and explain to them by phone why I adjust the neck
 to release the pain on 
the low back, they are 
dreaming.  I call you back in ten mi nute because I am with a patient .ﬂ  So, I hang up, call hi m 

ten, fifteen mi nute later and he sa
id, ﬁI call the insura
nce company, they settle.ﬂ  I don™t know 
what happen.  I try to get him before you arrive  a
nd he is not in his office.  But I will know what 
he said.  Because I said, ﬁYou have two way, but 
I™m not going to speak with this insurance.ﬂ  
Some time I™m very obnoxious... how do you call? 
 

Q: Obnoxious. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
44
 
 
  
44
A: Obnoxious with people who don™t know nothing about
 me dicine and challenge me .  If you want 
to challenge me  in me dic i ne, put me  in front 
of a bunch of doctor, who are going to understand 
what I am talking about.  I can tell you anythi
ng and you™re going to say, ﬁOh yes, oh yes.ﬂ  So, 
you™re going to say ﬁWell, this dummy, I don™t 
understand a word he is saying, but ma ybe he™s 
right.ﬂ  By phone?   Why do I adjust the neck to a low back pain?   An insurance company?   

[Laughing.] So, this is when I become  obnoxious. 
 But acupuncture is very
 mysterious.  Well, 
it™s five thousand year old and it™s amazing.  
I don™t know how far we can go with acupuncture.  

But my experience was more than rewarding fo
r me, I mean medically.  What I can do with 
acupuncture.  It™s amazing.  It™s am
a z ing.  I don™t believe it myself
.  If some body else would tell 
me  what I know, I would say, prove it to me . 
 

Q: Tell me, give me some e xamples.  Wh
at have you been able to do with it? 
 

A: Well, I did go this morning to put teeth and he 
drill.  And I said, ﬁI don™t wa nt any shot.  Let me  
put a needle, acupuncture needle in, you can do 
what you want.ﬂ  And the guy is, he teach 
dentistry here at UK.  And he sa
y, ﬁIt™s okay with me .ﬂ  So, I just
 put two needle and I said, ﬁGo 
ahead.ﬂ  And he said, ﬁYou™re sure? ﬂ   And I sai
d, ﬁOh yeah.ﬂ  So, he drill and he said, ﬁYou™re 
sure you don™t feel anything? ﬂ   
I said, ﬁListen, I™m huma n.  I don™t 
like pain and if it wa s painful 
I would have said, ‚The hell with acupuncture, give
 me  a shot!™  No, I don™t feel anything.ﬂ  And 
this is the wa y it is.  I have a young lady, who cam
e and she did have suspicious part of the 
breast.  So she said, ﬁI would 
love to try–ﬂŠbecause she is a pa
tient of mine of acupunctureŠ
ﬁYou said you can anesthetize myse
lf with acupuncture.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁSure.ﬂ  So, we did go to 
the hospital.  I prepared the whole thing the norma l way and I said, ﬁOkay, you ready?ﬂ  She 

said, ﬁYes.ﬂ  So, I put needle.  And the surg
eon came , a little bit smiling.  And I said, ﬁOkay, 
cut.ﬂ  And he said, ﬁYou™re sure? ﬂ
  And I said, ﬁThe lady agree, 
I agree, go ahead.ﬂ  He did the 
whole surgery under acupuncture.  She said, ﬁI didn™t feel nothing.ﬂ  And I was looking, because 
I said, ﬁMy God, if she, if she start to scream, I 
have to put the ma sk, give her the gas.  And I™m 
going to put her down deep.ﬂ  But she didn™t say 
anything.  Di d go to China at Christma s, this 
last Christma s.  And this guy, when I did go 
see my teacher, he said, ﬁWould you like to see 
something interesting?ﬂ  I said 
yes.  He said, ﬁI™m going to 
do acupuncture to an open heart 
surgery.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁCan I come ? ﬂ   And he said
 sure.  So, we did go.  Needle all over, start to 
see section open, bring the heart, ma s s age.  Th
e guy is covered here and the surgeon said, ﬁYou 
okay?ﬂ  He said, ﬁYes, I™m okay, butﬂŠit was in
 Chinese, I didn™t understandŠﬁI would like to 
drink some thing.ﬂ  So, they brought him a straw 
with orange juice and 
he drink and he was 
completely opened. [Laughing.] It™s very impressi
ve, very, very impressive.  So, it™s rewarding 

and  I like it. 
 

Q: You said that you lecture a lot a
nd do semi nars.  On what subjects? 
 

A: Acupuncture, but it™s very basic, because acupunct
ure in United State is not in a high level.  
They, I have a lot of article from pape r where 
they say if you have a headache, acupuncture can 
help you.  If woma n have bad me nstruation, acup
uncture, but you know they bring it to the lower 
part, not very high.  You know, whe n you speak 
about open heart surgery, they say, ﬁJust a 
mi nute.ﬂ  They don™t agree.  But they are interested.  They want to know.  So when, you know, 

every doctor have to do twelve, twenty four hour, depend on state.  So, they ask me  to come  and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

45
when I go and I give a semi nar sometime one-four
th of the class go away, skiing and swimming.  
[Laughing.] It™s no problem.   
 
Q: I™m going to change the subject 
back to the time that you™re in 
France after the war.  I think you 
me ntioned in the first intervie
w that you were very anxious to
 have your mother meet the 
Ledermans once you were reunited with your moth
er.  And did you go back with her to see 
them? 
 

A: Oh yes.  I did go back with my mother.  I did 
go back with my brother.  Well, I– every time  I go 
to Europe I go to see them.  I just receive 
a letter from mi ne, I don™t know how you call this, 
godmother?   And from what I understand he is not 
in this world anymore.  I think my godfather 
die.  So, she is there, she mu
st be over eighty.  So this, be
fore the Christ mas, this comi ng 
Christma s, I™m going to go back.  And I try to 
reach her by phone to find out how she™s doing.  
It™s not the same  address, it™s a
nother address.  So, I want to find out.  But when I came  back, I 
took my mother Œ oh very quick after the war, ma
ybe two year after war or three year after the 
war.  Because I did want  for... my mother was 
a very interesting person.  She didn™t ha ve any, 
she didn™t ever study.  She didn™t know how to write
, to read.  She was reading Jewish, Hebrew.  
And it took her about a week, a week
 and a half to read one paper 
in Hebrew.  But she was very, 
she was very smart, not by studying, but by instinct
.  And she– people like her.  The only thing 
I found out, is when people don™t have any back
ground of studying to read aloud, when they get 
old, they lose this norma l  instinct of life.  They
 are confused.  And I did have a lot of very Ph.D. 

me n, who got Alzheime r™s disease, so it doesn™t 
go with– but most of the time, these people, 

like my mot her, like my brother, they don™t have 
the training of the brain 
to be able to hold on, 
on some thing solid.  It™s only by me mory.  They 
don™t have any technique.  And the older she 
got, harder it was for us to discuss with her.
  She was, imagine thi
ngs, like one day she was 
watching TV and it was something completely no
rmal and she got very angry.  And I said, 
ﬁ What™s the ma tter?ﬂ  ﬁWell, you didn™t see what they 
did on this TV? ﬂ   And then I realize, well, 
she didn™t understand and she got ma d.  But othe
rwise, she was a very 
interesting person.  I 
cannot speak about my father because I was too young when he died.  But it, she was, she 
connect with my godfather when we did go see hi
m, because my godfather was also ve ry, very 
educated, a very interesting, wide
 idea of the world.  And they did have, I reme mber a very, very 

interesting conversation, in a 
high level, not ﬁIt™s a nice day 
today.  The food was good.ﬂ  It 
was... and mine, his wife of my god
father, she was a teacher.  I was in love with her, because she 
was, I think, the most beautiful woman in the worl
d.  She was smart.  And I was afraid from her, 
because she was a teacher.  At my age, a teac
her you don™t fool around with.  But I saw her later 
when I was a growing man and she was older and 
she was the most beautiful woma n I had me t.  
[Laughing.] 
 

Q: When you call them your godparent s, was there a
ny for mality or are you just calling them that 
because... wa s there any for mal way–? 
 

A: No, because I think they deserve to 
be  called this way.  In French it™s 
parrain
, and her it™s 
marraine
.  In English it™s godfather.  And I don™t 
know if we have a name  for a woma n.  But 
every time –eh? 
 

Q: Godmother.

A: Godmother?  Every time I used to write
 to them and even lately, I always, ﬁ
Cher Parrain, cher 
Marraine
,ﬂ because this is what they are for me.  Th
ey were ve ry generous with me  and I try to 
be as much as I can with them. 
 

Q: Did their influence continue to be very active? 

 

A: Yes.   

 

Q: So your relationship was... can you describe how
 your relationship grew after you stopped living 
with them? 
 

A: They were mi ne, smart parent.  What my father and mother couldn™t give me, because they 
didn™t have it.  My mother spoke to me .  She tr
ied to be as much as she could, but they never 
study and they didn™t know– you know, when I said
 I want to become  a doctor: ﬁWhy?   We  
have a good business.  We do upholstery.  You 
can ma ke a good living.  
Why would you like to 
be a doctor?  We  don™t have any doctor in the family.ﬂ 
 

Q: Did you tell the Ledermans when you wanted to become  a doctor? 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: Yeah.  And what was their response? 

 

A: Oh, he was, my godfather was very, very, both 
of them were happy.  Because like I told you, I 
was a poor student.  And they said, ﬁI don™t know
 if you are going to ma
ke it, but it™s an 
excellent idea.  Do it.ﬂ  They both 
were very, very, very happy.  And– 
 

Q: So, did you keep in touch with them by wr
iting letters?   Or did 
you visit them a lot? 
 

A: Both.  I wrote letter all the time and every 
time  I did go to... I left France in 1960, 1983 to come  
in the United State.  But otherwise I was in 
their place anyt ime.  They, t hey, you know, he was a 
Protestant priest and after this, 
he likes to show people he was poor.  It wa s his way to... he was 
not poor, but he wants to show.  
So, he bought a little place on th
e border of the lake, but on the 
other side to go to his house, you have to cross th
e railroad.  And I– he was very, very severe.   
And one day, I ask him, you know, very– ﬁWhy did 
you buy so close to the railroad?ﬂ  ﬁI™m not 

rich.  I™m poor.  I™m a priest.  I cannot afford to
 buy like the rich people, so thank God I can have 
this thing.ﬂ  I never ask anymore. [Laughing.] 
Because, he was, you know, this is what I can 
afford and that™s it.  But he was a good ma n, ve
ry, very good ma n.  Very, not religious like a 
priest, you know, not the ma n– one day I did go 
to, you know the Club Med?   It was my last 
year in me dicine and they ask for a good swim
mer to teach water ski and I was good on water 
ski, so I put my name and I been to Greece to 
teach in Club Med for two month, for the summer.  
It was beautiful, because it was...

Tape 4, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape four, side B. 
 So, you were saying about the...  
 

A: This group of Swiss people came and we start 
to, and I said, ﬁYou know, my godfather is from 
Switzerland, from this place.ﬂ  He say, ﬁWe are from
 this place!ﬂ  And he said, ﬁJust a mi nute.  
How is he? ﬂ  And I said, I describe him.  He said
, ﬁThis is Pastor Lederma n.ﬂ  And I said yes.  
He™s the only one to be like this. [Laughing.] He
 was known because he was very artistic, very 
wild and doing things, the way we have to 
do things.  You know, you don™t wake up in the 
morning.  First thing you do, wash your face a
nd shave.  You cannot go on without shaving.  
You know, he did have a lot of pr
inciple, but even up to
 this day, a lot of thing I do, I reme mber 
he teach me .  I reme mbe r  he told me , ﬁOh, you have to do this, you have to do this.  No, no, no.  

Don™t do this, this way, do it this 
way.ﬂ  And without thinking I do 
it the way he told me.  So, it 
means some time when you have a guru in life
, or parent who direct
 you the right way, you™ll 
reme mber things, and it helps 
you for the rest of your life. 
 

Q: You me ntioned a little 
bit earlier on, that you, did you say in around 1963 or so, you got 
married?   You got married after th
e war, sometime in the early 1960s? 
 

A: I think I was twenty-three.   

 

Q: Okay, so earlier than ni ne teen– 

 

A: Well, my da ughter is forty-two. 
 I™m sixty-seven.  We  have to 
count;  I™m not good in ma th.  But 
it was later, I mean like I said after the war I was 
thirteen.  So, let™s say ten years later I met this 
lady and we got ma rried.  I me t, she was an arti
st, painter and me dical school was next to, and 
the cafeteria was together.  And that™s where I met her. 
 

Q: Did she, was there, did she understand your hist
ory as a Jew and as a Jew who had mo re or less 
had gone through the Holocaust and what you™d expe
rienced with losing your fa mily?   Wa s that 
an issue? 
 

A: No.  No, she, it was a very, how can I say?  
 Very Catholic family. 
 And e verything was going 
fi ne, everythi ng was okay, until one day in Pari s... we 
used to live a little bit outsi de of Paris, like 
you would say in Nicholasville, compared to 
Lexington.  And one day it was a strike, no car, I 
mean, no bus, no train, nothing.  And my brothe
r-in-law, who was my age, studying to become  
an architect, did have a motorcyc
le.  He said, ﬁIf you want I can 
take you to the school, to the 
me dical school.ﬂ  And his school was very clos
e, too.  ﬁYou can ride on the back of the 
motorcycle.ﬂ   And I said okay.  And we rode there and comi ng to a fire place, you know, the red 

light?  The red light didn™t work.  He didn™t see th
e car and this car hit us and I flew over and fell 
down, but I didn™t get anything serious.  He did h
it the car di rectly and 
he broke all his mouth, 
his right knee.  Bad accident.  Bad, ba d accide nt.  
They took us to the hospital and even to this 

day, my daughter told me this yesterday, they 
going to do surgery on his 
hip.  But he did have 
bad, he lost all his teeth.  He was stitched all 
over.  He stopped studying architecture.  With the 
money he touch from the insurance, he bought a 
moulin

Q: Like a windmill? 
 

A: Wi ndmill!  He bought a windmill outside of Pari
s, about two hundred miles from Paris.  And he 
became a farmer with his mother, his father.  Th
e whole family moved there.  But his mother 

never forgave me  to be in the motorcycle, becaus
e she said, if I wouldn™t 
be in the motorcycle, 
he wouldn™t be so badly injured.  So, since this
 accident, there was a bad tension between us, 
between the fa mily and me .  Did it bring to th
e divorce?  Maybe yes, ma ybe no, I don™t know.  
But life became  much more difficult, more and mo
re.  And even my brother-in-law used to get 
mad at his mother every time she bring up this.  Because every time he never complained.  Ever.  

And sometime he was in bad shape.  But his mo ther
 said, ﬁYes, if you didn™t have this accide nt.ﬂ  
And he say, ﬁPlease you stop.ﬂ  And he always 
defend me  all the time , but she was, she was 
ma d. 
 

Q: Do you feel that, that was r
eally the reason... I mean, was she l
ooking for an excuse to be angry 
at you?    
 

A: I don™t know.  I really don™t know.  I don™t kno
w.  Very hard to know what™s going on, on the 
head of somebody else.  And we ne
ver got the chance to discuss.  
She didn™t want to discuss.  
There was no possibility.  The father, he was a 
bird.  He was not on this earth. [Laughing.] He 
was good man, but out.  So, he neve
r want to discuss about this. 
 He didn™t know anything about 
it.  He didn™t want to know about anything.  A
nd like I said, my brother-in-law didn™t, never 
ever, ever said anything.  Even when I was di
vorced, he always ask about me , what am I doing 
and everything is okay.  But the mother was mean.  She was ma d.   
 

Q: What about you being Jewish and 
ma rrying into a Catholic family? 
 
A: We never spoke about.  We ne
ver... my daughter is born.  And we
 decide not to give her any 
religion.  When she grew up, she met a ma n, got
 ma rried.  He was Catholic.  She became  
Catholic.  And– but I don™t know.  I don™t know if
 the religion was involved or not.  I don™t 
know.   
 
Q: Did you, you had talked about feeling anti-Sem
itism when you were living in France.  Did you 
have any concern about that
 among your wife™s fa mily? 
 

A: You know, you ma rried some body, you don™t ma rry the 
family.  For me , i t  didn™t matter.  I was 
happy with her.  I don™t have to love the mother, 
the father and the whole 
fa mily.  I don™t know if 
it was against Jew or really I don™t have no id
ea.  No idea.  Never asked the question.  The 
feeling between my mother and them... I think 
they saw each other for my wedding and that™s 
all.  They never spoke together.  They never 
got together.  It™s very
 difficult to explain. 
 

Q: What about anti-Semitism on other fronts in Fr an
ce after the war?   Did you experience any overt 
anti-Semitism?  
 

A: Oh yes, absolutely.  This is– even today, you 
can take the subway and 
on the subway in Paris, 
you can see ﬁJew go Homeﬂ or ﬁJew go to Israelﬂ 
 on the subway.  It means, you know, it™s like 

do we have anti-Semitism in United State?   Ye
s.  Why, we don™t know.  But one day I spoke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
49
 
 
  
49
with a woman from Lexington, she™s a doctor.  
And she does acupuncture and she one day asked 
me  if she ca n come  and watch me .  And we star
t to speak about things, I don™t reme mber exactly 
what it was and she said, ﬁOh, don™t worry.  The Jew,
 they have all the money.  They have all the 
bank.  Don™t ever trust a Jew.ﬂ [L
aughing.] I didn™t know what to say.  And I said, ﬁI have to tell 
you just now, I™m Jewi sh.  And why do you...ﬂ and she said, ﬁOh, because ma ybe you are not 
like this, but the Jew have  all the bank.  They 
got all the mone y in this country.  They are 
politician.  They going to ruin the whole United Stat
e.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁWell, if you feel this way, I 
think this meeting is going to be
 the last one.ﬂ  And it was the 
last one.  But, you know, when 
some body is ... at this point I know I™m going to be w
ith an enemy all the time.  So tell me who is 

my friend, I will find my  enemy.   
 

Q: And you me ntioned in the last interview that
 you didn™t really feel 
comfortable in France. 
 

A: No.  I don™t feel comfortable anyplace. 

 

Q: That™s what I was going to
 ask you, whether the United Stat
es is more comfortable? 
 

A: No.  United State is a nice place to live.  
It is mu ch simpler than France.  You can be 
independent, more than in France.  You can ha
ve, they don™t look at you like in France.  They 
spy the same  way in United State, but it™s a di fferent way.  It™s much easier.  In Fr ance, they spy 

on you much more.  And they don™t have the la
w you have in United State.  You know, the 
Constitution here, it™s very well made.  Freedom of Speech is very important.  We don™t have 

freedom.  United State is a Democracy.  France is
 a Republic.  And it can take hour for me  to 
explain to you, but I think you 
know the difference between De mocracy and Republic.  And here 
you can live... I was surprised how 
many people was killed in United State by crime last year.  
Twenty-five thousand people die.  It™s a lot of pe
ople.  We  don™t have so ma ny dead in France by 
crime because we don™t have this access of gun and 
all this.  But there is no safe place on Earth.  
And America is one of the most happy place you can be.  You can live a norma l life, almost.  

You can buy a car when you want.  If you are cour
ageous and work hard, you can ma ke  money, 
enjoy yourself.  But the limit is very short in Unite
d State.  And what is the limit?   My idea of 
limit is six hundred thousand dollar.  Not ever
ybody can save six hundred thousand dollar, but 
after six hundred thousand dolla
rŠand if you want, one day I™m 
going to explain this to youŠ
everythi ng, if you die or your husband die and le
ave you a million dollar, you™re going to get si x 

hundred thousand dollar.  The rest goes to 
the governme nt, no ma tte
r how you go.  They... the 
IRS law are very, very we ll ma de.  They give you 
this, they take this.  They get you anyway.  So 
if you have a little bit, if you are low profile, Unit
ed State is perfect.  I 
am a low profile doctor 
and it™s okay.  I like this life. 
 I don™t have any problem.  But people who become  rich, they do, 
they can, but they have to know how to do it.  I 
wouldn™t like to be rich in the United State.  
[Laughing] 
 

Q: Because you don™t support the way that the government spends the money that you have to pay 
them? 
 

A: Uhhuh. 

 

Q: What are your politic
al outlooks, affiliations? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
50
 
 
  
50
 
A: I don™t have any political idea, because for th
e simple reason, anybody who wants to go, want to 
be a politician has to put money in his pocket.  
Because people are stupid.  If people would be 
intelligent, they wouldn™t vote.  
Neither for Clinton, neither for Bush, Democrat, Republican, not 
vote.  We  don™t want you.  I would vote for Perot,
 just to see what he can do.  But he doesn™t 
play the game.  Perot is a smart ma
n, but he doesn™t play the game , so 
no there.  It™s not a dream.   
But let™s say maybe this movie act
or, what™s his name ?   Is going to present hims elf to become  
the President of the United St
ate.  Wa rren Beatty?   No.   
 

Q: I didn™t realize– 

 

A: Yeah.  He present, ma ybe he™s going to present himself.  But otherwise... what Clinton did is a 
shame for the country.  I don™t think 
he deserve to be called Presiden
t of United State.  He is a... 
but Bush was not better.  ﬁRead my lips, no more
 income  tax,ﬂ I mean, and look what he did.  

And the people go, they™re going to vote for his s
on, or they™re going to vote for another jerk, 
moron, who is going to be the President.  The peop
le need to be whacked in the head.  And it™s 

okay.  I don™t belong to the people.  I™m 
not a politician.  So I enjoy myself. 
 

Q: So you don™t vote? 

 

A: Yes I vote.  Yeah, I vote because I think it™s 
a duty.  I vote, but just because I have to.  
[Laughing.] 
 

Q: So you™re a... when did you become  a  citizen? 

 

A: Oh, in 1983– ‚93. 
 
Q: Was that a significant event for you to
 become  a citizen of this country? 
 

A: No. [Laughi ng.] No, no i t ™s not.  
I think more about myself as a ci
tizen of the world, more than a 
citizen of a country.  It doesn™t 
matter.  I™m an American.  I™m a Spanish.  I™m an Italian.  I™m a 
French.  Wh at does it mean?   I™m human.   
 

Q: Why did you decide to come  
to the United States in 1983? 
 

A: Well, number one is because I was a little bit ti
red about what I was feeling in France.  And it 
was time for  me  to change and this was some  fe e
ling.  I have feeling some ti me  and this was the 
time for me to go away.  Even I did have a 
very good practice in Fran
ce, everything was going 
fine, but [clears throat]Šexcuse me Šit was time 
for me  to do some thing else.  And since before 
I left United State in 1962, I 
took the State Board of Kentucky. 
 I came back in Kentucky to 
establish... and I didn™t know wh
ere.  I choose Lexington becaus
e it was a challenge.  And I 
decide to open an office here and later ma ybe go 
to another state.  Because when you come  back 
in United State with a license, you have to stay at
 least three year in th
e state, before you can 
move to another one.  I tried to
 have the equivalence of my me
dical license here and I found out 
Kentucky is one of the most difficu
lt state to have a reci
procity of the diploma.
  So, I decide I™m 
going to have mi ne, I did have mi ne license for 
Chiropractic, so I took 
my  chiropractic license, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002

renew it, and I stay here.  And 
since 1983, I did have three differ
ent office, one in Versailles 
Road, the another one in North Br
oadway for at least fourteen y
ear and now in Paloma r.  And it 
was very, very interesting.  I like the state.  I like 
the weather.  A little bit 
cold in the winter time, 
but–  I like horses, so I™m very happy when I can 
drive in the country and 
see all the horses.  I 
have a lot of friend who have horses.
  I ride a lot of horses.  And I 
travel a lot.  I gi ve a lot of 
semi nar in United State and in Europe.  I go to 
China once every five year to re-educate mi ne 
acupuncture.  And life is great here
.  Right now I have a project. 
 I don™t know if I™m going to do 
it.  But either I™m going to move to the Cari
bbean in an island where there is already a 
chiropractor.  And I™m going to go see him probabl
y at the end of this month, September, 1999.  
Or if I don™t like what I see th
ere, I probably going to buy a 
farm in Woodford County around 
Versailles, like we say here.  And have a fa rm 
with horses and my practice at the same time until 
I die.  So, this is going to be my project
 until the end of 1999.  Th
inking about what, I don™t 
know if it is going to be different in the y
ear two thousand.  Everybody think about some thing 
different.  I don™t think nothing is
 going to happen, but anyway it doesn™t ma ke any difference 
for me.  And this is my project. 
 I was very happy for my move to 
come  here.  It™s different.  It™s 
very, even up to this day since 1983 I™m back in Un
ited State, even up to this day it is very hard 
for me to adapt to the American life, but it™s not
 too bad.  And I™ll surviv
e.  And we™ll see what 
my project are going to give me  and what am I go
ing to do.  But it™s going to be a surprise for 
myself and for my friends. 
 

Q: What™s hard to adapt to about American life? 

 

A: It is completely different.  Life here is di
fferent.  People li
ve differently, they got different 
priority.  I could say th
e same  thing about France.  They in 
France, they live different.  They 
have different personality.  Here, we don™t eat, we nourish ourselves.  In 
France a meal is like a 

big festivity.  We  take our time.  Relation betw
een ma le and fema le in France is much more 
roma ntic.  It is much mo re some thing sensitive, 
sensual.  Here it™s much more difficult, woma n 
wants to be man.  Sometimes ma
n be come woma n.  It is, it woul
d take a whole book to explain 
the difference between Fr ance and United State. 
 But when you want, you adapt.  And I go back 
to France at least once or twi
ce a year.  Every time I go, I enjo
y.  I have a good time.  I read 
almost everything in French, because  since I left
 France, I think poetry in
 France is beautiful.  
And there is no problem, you always survive. 
 You adapt and you survive.  You don™t have 
always exactly what you want, but where do we have
 what we want?   It™s another world and it™s 
for me  like another life.   
 

Q: WhyKentucky? 

 

A: Well, because when I left, I took my  license 
in 1962.  I took the first license open and it was 
Kentucky.  So, I took my license 
and I didn™t even wait for the results.  Did go back home , open 
my office.  And I receive my license from Kent
ucky and this is why I came  back here.  And 
when I came  back here, I thought ma ybe I™m going to 
go to another state, but
 after a while I said, 
where can I go?   It™s nothing worse 
here or better than any other place.  I™m not a California ma n.  
I™m not a Florida ma n.  So, it™s pretty good here.  S
o, I think this is where I am going to stay, if I 
don™t go to an island. 
 

Q: Did you know anything about Kent
ucky before you ma de the move? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
52
 
 
  
52
 
A: No.  No.  Nothing.  No.  I knew there was a lot 
of horses, that™s all.  
But otherwise it took me a 
long time to understand the way they speak English, 
but now I think I™m us ed to.  A lot of people 
even now don™t understand me , but it doesn™t ma tter 
because they adopt me.  I like them, they 
like me  and we don™t have any problem.   
 

Q: You didn™t have any stereotypes of what
 Kentucky was or what the South was? 
 

A: No, I was surprised at the beginning a lot of
 times, because I didn™t 
know people still using 
chewing tobacco.  And I didn™t know... well, when I was in New York on my way to come  here, 

a friend of mi ne said, ﬁIf you go to Kentucky, they 
are fifty years behind 
every other state.ﬂ  I 
didn™t believe it, but there was a little bit tr
uth of what they say.  But didn™t bother me , no 
problem. 
 

Q: Are you involved in the comm
unity in Lexington in any way? 
 

A: No, no, I don™t like to be involve
d in groups.  I™m not a politician. 
 I™m not a religious ma n.  So, I 
look, if it was some thing I can do or some thing I 
can help, I probably would do, but I stay put.  I 
stay on my backyard.  I don™t want 
to be too mu ch involved with al
l those things, so.  I™m in the 
back. 
 

Q: Do you have Jewish friends in Lexington? 

 

A: Yes, I have a few Jewish friend, but like I al
ways said, they are American Jew and they don™t 
know exactly what it is to be a European Jew, so 
we have a lot of difference.  The ma in thing is, 
Jewish in Europe help themselv
es with other Jew, around here to be Jew for another Jew doesn™t 
mean nothing.   
 

Q: Do you feel that your experien
ces as a Holocaust survivor set 
you apart in some way fr om the 
Jewish community here?    
 

A: You mean?    I don™t quite understand what– 

 

Q: The fact of your association with the Holocau
st and your imme diate experience, losing fa mily 
me mbers and so forth, gives you a very different 
personal history than American Jews, in the 
sense of the fact that you™ve seen this incred
ible tragedy close up and felt the effects very 
directly on your life.  I™m wondering whether, 
whether that has been a wall between you and 
Jews here? 
 

A: Yes, let™s put it this way, 
they are Jewish.  They know what happened in Europe.  They are 
interested for six mi nute, that™s 
all, all the rest, it goes above the 
head.  They don™t 
feel like really 
they are concerned.  Even if it looks like, but 
they are, you know: ﬁIt™
s just, it happened.  We  
hope it™s never going to happen agai
n.  Only if they start to touc
h Jewish people in United State, 
this is another story, but otherwise, we  sendŠt
his is what they sayŠwe send money to Israel, 
we help them.  We  have  a clean conscience.  We  are good Jew.ﬂ

Tape 5, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number five, side
 A of an interview with Paul Pr essman.  Do you feel that the Jews 
here in Lexington that you™ve co
me into cont act with are naïve? 
 

A: Not only the Jew from Lexington, everywhere I 
did go... my name  in France is unique, because 
there is no ot her Pressman.  But every time I go in
 places like San Francisc
o, any place, I look in 
the telephone book to see there is 
Pressman and I found a few.  
I call them and there is no, no 
feeling.  I don™t... you know, they say, ﬁOh yea
h, your name  is Pressman, oh yeah, interesting.  
Where were you?   From where are you, you have
 an accent?ﬂ  But we don™t feel like... for 
example, let™s say somebody, many time people came in
 my office in Paris saying ﬁI™m Jewish, I 
come from Yugoslavia.  I™m passing through here 
and I™m going to try to go to United State or 
Spain or place.ﬂ  ﬁOkay, where do you sleep toni
ght? ﬂ   ﬁWell, I don™t have any place.ﬂ  ﬁYou 
come  and you sleep at my place and you™re going to
 eat with me and I™m 
going to call a few...ﬂ 
And I try to put some  money together and give  it 
to this guy, so he can fulfill... when I came here 
the first time, I did go to a Jewish association, 
I don™t reme mber the name, to introduce myself.  
And say, ﬁMy name  is Paul Pressman, I™m a me di
cal doctor and I™m going to open an office.ﬂ  
They lady look at me  and she said, ﬁI™m sorry, we
 don™t have money to give to you.ﬂ  And I say, 
ﬁLady I didn™t come  to ask money, I just came  to
 introduce myself.ﬂ  I left and never, never saw 
those people again.  They send me  paper and they 
wrote me  letter.  I said, ﬁIf this is the way you 
welcome pe ople in your congregation, the hell w
ith you.  Stay where you are and I stay off.ﬂ  
This is why since the beginning 
I didn™t join anybody.  I didn™t 
speak with anybody and I stay in 
my corner.  A lot of patient, Jewish patients,
 said ﬁOh, you should come .ﬂ  I said, ﬁYou go and 
you leave me  alone.  I don™t wantto belong.ﬂ  One day the Ra bbi came here and he spoke to me  

and he said, ﬁAs a Jewish ma n you should at l
east belong to the synagogu
e.ﬂ  And I said, ﬁYou 
belong to the synagogue.  You leave 
me  alone.  I don™t want to see you anymore in my  office.  If 
you need me , if you have a health problem, I w
ill take care of you, otherwise forget me .ﬂ  I 
didn™t like the attitude.  I didn™t 
like the way they been treating 
people.  And now suddenly, they 
take Jewish people from Russia and they give th
em home .  Who do they think they show this?   
For what?   No, it™s... for me , there are two kind of 
bad Jew in this world, the German Jew and the 
American Jew.  I don™t have any respect
 for the German.  We call them the 
Yecket
 
(ph)
.  And 
what we call the Jew here, speaking about the 
wo ma n, Amer ican Jew, the JAP, the Jewish 
American Princess.  I don™t want
 to have nothing to do with them
.  They c a n live their life, but 
I™m Jewish by tradition.  I don™t go to the syna
gogue.  And they go to the synagogue.  They do 
the Bar Mitzvah for the kids, but it™s
 not my kind.  So, I stay away 
from these people.  That™s all. 
 

Q: How do you feel as a 
Jew living in Kentucky? 
 

A: I don™t have any problem.  I don™t have any probl
em.  When people ask me  what kind of religion 
I am, I say ﬁI™m born Jewﬂ and there is no probl
em.  There is no, ﬁAh, you™re Jewish.ﬂ  No, no.  
They don™t say anything.  We  have to reme mber
 United State is based on the free willing of 
religion.  Anybody can be what they want.  S
o, you have, I think, about two hundred different 
Christian religion.  Everything goe
s okay, is no problem.  If there is no problem with them, it™s 
no problem with me. 
 

Q: Do you consider yourself a Holocaust survivor?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002
  
 
55

A: Oh yes, oh yeah.  Yeah.  I don™t, without bei
ng sent to Auschwitz, I™m the closest one to suffer 
and been suffering because of the Nazi and because I was Jewi sh.  Oh yes.   
 

Q: And is that an important part
 of your identity as fa r as, I mean when you get to know people for 
example, is it important for them to 
know that you are a 
Holocaust survivor? 
 

A: No, no, no.  This is some thing who come s if they
 are interested, we can speak about it.  But no, 
this is mi ne, this is my life.  I didn™t choose it. 
 This is the way it is and I™m not ashame d of it.  
I™m not proud of it.  This is the way it is.  Th
ey say Jewish people are 
the chosen people from 
God.  We  pa y the price.  But it™s okay.  If in 
the next life, we™re going 
to have another religion, 
ma ybe we going to be able to breathe 
a little bit and l
ook on the other side. 
 

Q: Do you, have you ever thought about... the publi
c consciousness of the Holocaust has changed a 
lot in recent years.  People have become much 
more aware of Holocaust hi story and much more 
interested in it, it seems, on 
a popular culture level, 
a lot of books, films a nd so forth.  Have you 
been interested at all in speaking publicly 
about those experiences
 that you™ve had? 
 

A: No, because my, the way they do it now, is beca
me movies, to make mo vies.  It™s always very 
hard to ma ke a good mo vie.  This is a good subjec
t.  Books, the writer will write about another 
writer, who wrote some thing about the Holocaust
.  It become s diluted.  And I think... me n like 
my brother, for example, who survive Holocaust, 
doesn™t want to speak in public, because they 
wouldn™t understand what he™s got to say.  I mean, they wouldn™t... they say, that™s impossible, 

you tell us a story.  Stor y he told me , I know it™s 
true, because he wouldn™t lie to me .  And he™s 
not a liar.  But I can put myse
lf in the shoes of some body who never heard about Holocaust, 
listen to what he™s got to say.  It doesn™t ma ke se
nse.  It is the truth, but it doesn™t ma ke sense.  
This didn™t happen.  It can™t be done.  So, ri
ght now, sure, more we do about the Holocaust 
Museum, the best it is because it helps for people 
not to forget.  But it™s the basic.  Unless 
some body is  really interested on what happen andI mean Jewish people who are interested, they 
can find this some place.  But in public, you know... my brother did go to Ge rmany in a school to 

speak about Holocaust and half of the cla
ss didn™t know what was Holocaust.  ﬁWhat do you 
mean by Holocaust?  What is it? 
 A fruit?   A piece of bread?  
What is Holocaust? ﬂ   So.  You 
know you speak in front of people about some th
ing they don™t understand.  They don™t have a 
clue of what you talking about.  They say, ﬁWhat 
is he talking about?   Did he ma ke a movie?ﬂ  
Schindler List
 was something close to the Holocaust 
and it ma ke sense.  It was huma n.  
Auschwitz is unhuman.  You tell things about Auschwitz
.  It is not real.  It™s a bad dream.  And 
you have people listen to... ﬁThis guy is nuts.  He  
doesn™t know what he is talking about.ﬂ  But 
this happen.  So, right now, I 
don™t think it™s a good, I mean the best thing is to have museum 

and encourage people... my attorney here se
nt his sonŠhe™s Jewis
hŠhe sent his son at 
Washington.  And when he came back, he didn™
t speak for one week.  And the father said, 
ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ  He said, ﬁI
 was shocked.  What they did to
 Jewish people.  I wa s shocked 
from what I saw.ﬂ  So, I think the mo st impor
tant is to send people there, children, the new 
generation, for them to see what happened.  Whe n
 I did go to Auschwitz, full bus of school kids 
used to come  in Auschwitz to see the crematorium 
where all the Jewish di e.  And I think this is 
wonderful, because we should never forget wh
at happened.  But speaking in the public and

56
explaining things, it™s not enough.  You have to visu
alize.  You have to s ee things.  This is why 
the Museum is important.   
 
Q: When did you go to Auschwitz? 

 

A: Two years ago in March.  At the anniversary of 
the death of my other brother.  I did go with my 
brother because he show me  every place he been. 
 Where were the kitchen.  Where was the, the 
hospital, or things like this.  It 
was, it was very, very interesting. 
 

Q: Can you talk more about what 
that whole trip was like?   
 

A: Well, we left from Paris to Wa rsaw and Auschwitz
.  It was very short, because it™s very close to 
Paris.  And we stay in a crummy hot el, because
 this was the only hotel in Auschwitz-Birkenau.  

We did, uh, Auschwitz is a military camp, military pl
ace.  This is where there all the glasses 
from the Jewish people who die.  The clothes, th
e hair, the shoes, the denture.  And you see all 
this exposed behind glass.  And after this you go 
in the barrack and wood where they live.  And I 
think it is very impressive and it is real.  Th
e only thing my brother was surprised when we did 
go the first time  and he said, ﬁSomething is differe
nt.ﬂ  The barrack is the same , the whole thing.  
The grass, it was grass, high grass.  By the time
 people were there, you di
dn™t have any grass.  
Why?   Because they eat the grass.
  So, the little pi ece of grass on the ground was eat, it was food.  
This is why it was different.  But otherwise, the 
whole thing, the concentration camp, I mean the 
crematorium, everything was... there is a little
 lake in the mi ddle of the camp, not very big, 
where they put all the ashes of 
the dead people.  Below forty de
gree in winter time, this lake 
never froze, because of the grease of the human body. 
 And a lot of things lik
e this.  It is, I think, 
a place to see.  I think if I was an
 American Jew, this is the first 
place I want to go.  I wa nt to see 
what happened.  But when you say this to Jewish pe
ople, they say ﬁI have 
better place to go.ﬂ  I 
say, ﬁGood for you.ﬂ   
 

Q: Was it an important trip for you a
nd your brother to
 ma ke together? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah.  It was very impor
tant to be together.  For me  to
 see where he was, where did he 
sleep, how did he live?   What was 
the... everything is dead anymore.  I have a lot of feeling when 

I go some  place.  There was no feeling, everything 
is gone.  The only thing stay is the wall, the 
cabin, the wood barrack, but everything is gone.  Th
e spirit is gone.  But it™s very impr essive.  
This is where you see the railroad train would ar
rive and it stop right th
ere.  All the Jewish 
people did go down, the ones going to go to the gas chamber on this right, the one who is going 

to live a little bit, on the left.  And, I mean, this 
is some thing you have to see.  And I have to say, 
I™m very thankful to the Polish governme nt, who ar
e the most anti-Semitic people in this earth, to 
maintain the camp the way it is.  It ™s very, very 
important to keep it the way it is, because, like I 
said, most– a lot of people have to see this.  
But they do a good job.  And it™s free, the entrance 
is free.  And everything is kept the wa
y it was.  And it™s some thing to see. 
 

Q: Do you have anything else that you™d 
like to say or to talk about today? 
 

A: No, I think we cover most of the path.  If you 
think about some thing later and you want for us to 
meet again, it will be no problem.  But I thi
nk now, we saw the overa
ll picture and now it™s

going to be your job to put this 
together.  And it was a very ni
ce interview and I was very happy 
to do it. 
 
Q: Well, thank you very mu ch, I was happy, too.
