A: Well, she was -- she was a terr ific mother. Sh
e -- she wanted my brother and me  to -- not to

hard for us to -- after Hitler came  to power ,

secretary for a -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- big concern in -- in Koblenz, a Jewish c
oncern, yeah. And -- but my father was -- he was

he -- he wasn™t always home . But when you compare 
it to -- to fwa -- to th
e foot -- to the -- to 
today -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- he was home  quite a bit, yes. 

Q: Did -- did you live on a farm with horses? 

A: No, no, we lived in the city. Li ved in the city
 and we -- it was a -- a 
three or four story house 

and in back of the house there was a courtyar
d and a good sized barn. We  had no land, so to 
speak. We  bought all the feed for the horses, 
we bought the hay and -- and -- and -- and I 

reme mber they used to buy carrots
 to feed horses. Of all things, 
carrots. And grain, that we kept 
in the barn. And there was probably 
room for -- probably a dozen horses. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So it™s a big barn. 
A: Good sized barn, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was right 
-- right in -- in the city
 of Koblenz. And the 
far mers used to come  to our house and pick
 out the horses that 
they wanted to buy. 
Q: So did -- did you -- 
A: Now -- 

Q: Yeah, go ahead. 

A: -- my -- when -- when my f-father married my 
mother, he went into business with -- with my 
grandfather. 

Q: I see. 

A: So they were both there. We  lived 
in the same house with my grandparents. 

Q: And whose hou -- was that your grandparents™ house? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
5 
 
A: It was my grandparents™ house, yes. It was qu
ite a large house, there 
were other people, there 
were, I think three ap -- three apartments
 in the house that were rented out. 
Q: So who lived on the first 
floor?  Grandparents, or your -- 
A: No, no, no, in fact, we lived on the same  floor. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: On the first floor. 

Q: So you lived together with your grandparents? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: So did that mean your grandpare
nts took care of you a lot, or not? 
A: Oh yes, my -- of course my gran
dmother was there all the time, yes. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then -- and my mother and grandmother, 
yes, my gr andfather wa s there. He was an old 
ma n already, what I considered an old ma n. 
Q: What do you -- how do you -- how old do you think he wa s? 
A: We ll, as far back as I can reme mb er, he was in his 70™s. 

Q: Uh-huh. Did you and your brother go out to the ba
rn and take care of 
the horses as well, or 
were you not allowed there? 

A: Not really. We  had the -- we had a 
hired man, Konesh, a hired man that --  
Q: Was that his name? 

A: Can™t think of his name  any more. He was -- he 
also -- he was not just an ordinary hired ma n, 
he also helped in the business, 
he -- he would deliver the horses
, on foot, he didn™t get truck like 
-- like you do today. But my grandfather was still 
active in the business, but my dad was really 
the -- the dealer. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

Q: Right. 
A: The dealer. And of course we went to
 school, went to kindergarten. And -- 
Q: Did you like school? 

A: Did I like school?  I thought it was not necessary.  

Q: From the  beginning you thought it wasn™t necessary? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you -- was your bro -- was your br
other the same  wa y once he started? 
A: No, he was more -- 

Q: He -- he liked it more. 

A: He -- he -- more studious than I wa s. 

Q: Did that disappoint your moth
er that you didn™t like school? 
A: I™m sure, I™m sure. I™m sure it di d. 

Q: Wa s -- was yours a religious home, Ernie? 
A: No. We ll, we kept all holidays. We  kept 
the Sabbath, of course, 
we kept a kosher home . 
Q: Oh, you did? 
A: We  did keep a kosher home , but I wouldn™t call
 it religious. We  went to -- Friday nights we 
went to shul, Saturdays we went to shul. And st
ill we were not [indecipherable] have a me mory, 

there were ma ny more religious people in
 -- in Koblenz than -- than we were. 
Q: But what you say sounds fairly religious -- 

A: Yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- you did a lot, right? 

A: -- to what -- what you -- yeah, that™s comp
ared to today, oh yeah, yes, we only ate kosher 
meat and kept the flesh thing and [indecipherabl
e] things separate. We nt to Hebrew school. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

Q: Oh, you did? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you like that school? 

A: Not as mu -- it was a lot more la --  lax. 

Q: Right. 

A: Of course that -- that was interr upted fairly early. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Let me  -- let me  ask you just a couple of ot
her questions about the 
house. Who cooked in the 
house, did your mother or your grandma? 

A: Grandmother, yes, my grandmother. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes, she -- 
Q: Was she a good cook? 
A: She was a -- oh yeah, she was a good cooker. A
nd like my  -- like I said, my mother kept the 
books for the business. 

Q: So she worked for the business as opposed to working -- 

A: But -- but -- but -- yeah, but she also -- 
she also helped in the house, I™m sure. 
Q: Who wer e  your friends, besides -- well, I don
™t know if your brother was a friend, he was so 
much younger at a certain point. 

A: He was a lot younger than I was, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

A: I had my -- the kids that I hung out with, were
 mostly the kids on the -- on the street, that 
lived on the same  street I did. And I knew ever
ybody on -- on the street
 and everybody knew me . 
Couldn™t get out of school early enough so we c
ould go and play, boys, girls. Pl ayed a lot of 
soccer. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I ha -- my best friend was a -- a Jewish boy, Manfred Raml a His parents came from 

Kolomaya, from Poland. He was my
 best friend, and he had a brot
her that was the same  age as 
my -- my br other, they were friends. Of course
, I knew all the Jewish bo
ys and girls, but we 
didn™t ge t close until, oh, probably ™37, until we 
couldn™t go to school any more, and aft -- and 
then we -- on -- on weekends most of them ca me  to my house . 

Q: The kids came to your house, yeah. 

A: The kids did, the kids my age, yes.  

Q: Before ™37 or ™38, were you frie
nds with non-Jewish kids as well? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, yeah [indecipherable] 

Q: And it was an easy relationship? 

A: Oh yeah. I mean, it was, you got just a few littl
e o -- pals, and got along well. Of course there 
were always, with some  -- some  always had rema
rks about my Jewishness, 
but the kids are -- not 
the kids on my street, the kids 
away from my street, they w
ould call me  dirty Jew bastard, you 
know, and things like that. But for some  reason, I 
didn™t take much of th
at. I always -- if 
somebody would call me  that, I™d 
let them know I  didn™t like it. 
Q: And how would you -- 

A: In wo -- not only vocally. 

Q: You beat them up?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
9 
 
A: I tried, yes. 
Q: Did you succeed? 

A: Most of the time. 

Q: Most of the -- 

A: Yes, yeah. There was one kid that I played 
a lot with. [indecipherable] Fogel, now the name  
come s to me , [indecipherable] Fogel, yes. We  alwa
ys played soccer together, and he was really a 
-- a stronger kid than me . But -- and he hardly 
ever said anything, but 
when he did, there was 
always -- I would never -- I ha 
-- I never took it, I nev -- I alwa
ys -- we dropped everything and 
we -- we hit each other, you know. 

Q: And did he stop th
en [indecipherable] 
A: But he [indecipherabl
e] he stop, he stop. 
Q: Do you think it was serious for him, or it was just a game ?  

A: No, no, it was a -- it was a game for him, it wa
s a way to get -- if he didn™t get his way, it was 
a way to get back at me. But there w -- ther e -- th
ere was definitely anti-Semitism, but before ™37 
-- I think it was thi -- ™37 - 
™36, it didn™t affect me  ve
ry mu ch. After that, it -- 
Q: After that, it -- 

A: After that it did. 

Q: After you were taken out of school. 

A: After we had -- 

Q: Did you -- did you notice uniformed soldiers
, or people in funny uniforms that you hadn™t 
seen before, after ™33?  

A: Yes, even e -- even the -- the people that live
d upstairs, they had -- they had -- had a son, mus t  
have been in the early 20™s, he 
was with the arbeitsdienst. That was even before the SR at that  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

time. He would come in uniform always. And -- 
but he -- [indecipherable] they lived in our 
house, we were never close with them, and esp
ecially not him. But they didn™t bother us. 
Q: Didn™t bother you. 
A: Didn™t bother us, until,
 like I say, ™30 -- ™37 - ™38. 
Q: So in ™37, you™re 11 years old, right?  A
nd that™s the end of school, is that right? 
A: Ki-Kicked us out of 
school [indecipherable]  
Q: So it™s -- in some  way were you happy, because you didn™t like school so much?  

A: No. 

Q: You weren™t happy. 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: How did you find out?  Did you go
 to school and the teacher 
said you can™t come ?  How did 
you know to -- not to go? 

A: Don™t really reme mbe r , just that 
I know we couldn™t go to school any more. 
Q: Right. So when -- go ahead. 

A: I reme mb er my -- I heard them talk about it, that -- ma  -- my fath
er talked to -- I was 
supposed to go to the -- in ginsk -- gymnasium, an
d he talked to -- he knew one of the teachers, 
and [indecipherable] says, just se nd him to me , 
you know, I will teach him. But that -- I never 
did.  

Q: So you -- uh-huh. 

A: I never did go be -- I -- things re
ally got serious by that time, and -- 
Q: Did -- did your mother do anything with
 you at home in terms of schooling? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
11 
 
A: No, no. We -- we tried desperately to get out
 of Ger many. They closed our business down. 
But I think that wasn™t until -- we was closed down [i ndecipherable] 
Q: ™38, November ™38. 

A: -- ™38, yeah.  

Q: Yes. 

A: That wasn™t until ™38. 

Q: ™38. So -- 

A: But they mi ght have shut us down before 
that already, I -- I am not sure any more. 
Q: But you still stayed in -- 

A: But we couldn™t do business any more. 

Q: But you still stay in the house? 

A: I stayed in the house, played
 with the kids on the street. 
Q: Right. Do you recall that your 
father all of a sudden is staying home a nd he™s not working? 
A: Oh yes, it was -- I -- I reme mber that some busin
ess was done anyway at first, until they really 

clamp -- because farmers would -- they would co
me  and wa -- wanted to do some  -- some  of 
them -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- would come  and wanted to do business with 
us. Then there were some  that probably owed 
us some money that -- that
 didn™t come  any more. 

Q: Wa s -- was this business ma inly with non-
Jews, or is this a very mi xed business? 
A: All with non-Jews. 

Q: All with non-Jews. 

A: All with non-Jews, yes, as far as I reme mber, yeah -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
12 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- yes. There was a -- a ma rket in -- in -- in
 Koblenz that my father 
and grandfather used to go 
to and I remember in the l -- the later years my -- 
his -- his brothers and cousins that were cattle 
dealers would still come  to the ma rket and they
 would -- they would some times bring the cows 
to our barn until the market opened up. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But -- but that -- the reason for that was because they couldn™t -- it was difficult for them to 

bring the cattle to the -- to the market. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then some  of the far mers would come  to 
us. I reme mber one in particular, he -- the -- Mr. 
Ebart, he was the ma yor of Atsaport. And they ha
d vineyards and he al -- 
he came on his bicycle, 
saw us always, and he would do business with us. 

Q: So, during this period before Kristallnac
ht, we -- I mean, you don™t know when it was that 
your father th -- when the business stops. Is th
ere a lot of talking be
tween you and your mother 
and father about getting out of Ger -- 
do you know that they™re trying to get out? 
A: Oh -- oh, oh yes, I -- I reme mber them, my -- 
my -- especially my mot her writing to South 
America. There was talk about going to Chile, goi
ng to Ecuador. We  tried to come  to the United 
States, we had relatives here th
at had immi grated to the United States early -- early on, and both 
on my mother™s side and my fath
er™s side. But they ma de it so
 difficult for us, so hard. The 
United St -- especially the Unite
d States did. There was a quota, 
you couldn™t -- and -- and you -- 
you -- you had to have guarantees that after we --
 if -- if you would -- if
 you would get to the 
United States we wouldn™t be a burden to the government. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
13 
 
A: So that we had -- I reme mber we had -- my mo
ther had cousins in -- in
 Saint Louis, and my 
father had cousins in Oklahoma, and they 
both guaranteed for us, and still we -- 
Q: Still you couldn™t. 

A: -- we couldn™t come . We d -- really didn™t want to go to South America. And as it finally 

turned out, we didn™t. But -- 

Q: Wa s your mother fluent in English as well as Ge rman? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, yes. She -- she took seve
n years of French and, I don™t know, four or five 
years of -- of English. And she worked as a -- as
 a bilingual secretary for 
this -- for this paper 
factory. They ma de e-envelopes as fa r as I know, envelopes.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And they exported all over the world.  

Q: Wa s your fa mily diffe rent from other familie
s in thinki ng so quickly about getting out of 
Germany? What -- what  -- 
A: Well -- 
Q: What do you think it was? 

A: That we thought th
at early to get out? 
Q: Cause not everyb -- ye s, because not ever
ybody thought that they ne eded to get out. 

A: I -- there were -- maybe it had something to do 
because we had family in this country already 
and we couldn't do any business any more. I -- 
we  were not well to do. We were, would say 
mi ddle -- mi ddle class people. We  ha d 
to do something to ma ke a living. 
Q: Right. 

A: I know that some  of my Jewish friends, th
eir parents didn™t thi
nk Hitler would last long, 
didn™t -- they never got out. In fact
, my other fr -- ma ybe 20 kids 
my age, my brother and I, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
14 
 
were the only ones -- well, Samuel [indecipherable]
 got out. Sa muel Lintne r got out, and Arthur 
[indecipherable] got out. 
I think those were -- 
Q: That™s all. 
A: -- out of 20 some  odd kids, just the four of
 us got out, the rest of
 them all perished.  
Q: And do you recall talking with other kids 
about your trying to get out, that the -- 
A: Oh yes, oh yeah. 

Q: -- and saying to them, you should -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- you should all get out too? 

A: We ll, we were kids. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was an adventure for us all.  

Q: You weren't afraid. 
A: We ren™t really afraid, we were very uneasy, bu
t we didn™t realize, until my father came  back 
from the concentration camp, from Dachau. 
Q: Yeah, let™s talk a little bit about -- 
do you reme mber when your father was arrested? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: And this is before Kris
tallnacht?  Do you remember? 
A: It was right around that time  -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- that he -- they came 
and arrested him, yes. 
Q: And did you see that?  Did you see people comi ng?  

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
15 
 
Q: Who came? 
A: They came  and arrested him. I reme mber 
my mother sending me  down to where he was 

supposed to be, and I reme mber going there. I 
wanted to find out why, how, where he was. 
Thought -- it™s so long ag
o, I don™t -- the particular
s I don™t reme mber, you know. 
Q: Do you reme mber going by yourself? 

A: By myself, yes. 

Q: Wa s this to a jail, do you think? 

A: To a place, yes, to -- wa -- 
I-I didn™t know, it wa
s a big building. 
Q: Right. And did you go inside? 

A: I went inside and I talked to some body, yes.
 But the -- they send me  -- they send me  back 
home , and -- 

Q: So you didn™t see your fa -- you didn™t see your father. 

A: I didn™t get to see my father. Now, I don™t rememb
er that -- that he came  home again and then 
they re-arrested him. I know at about
 that time he was sent to Dachau. 
Q: And do you reme mbe r  when you found out that 
he was -- was there some  communication, or 
was it a rumor that he was sent?  Do you have an idea? 

A: My mother knew. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: How we found out, I don™t reme mber. 

Q: Right. So that -- it mu st have be
en awful in the house when he was -- 
A: Wa s -- that was very bad, yes, it was terrib
le for us. Course we 
didn™t know what went on 
there, and we didn™t know until after he came ho
me . We -- we knew somebody that my mother -- 

that was supposed to be with th
e gest -- Gestapo, with 
-- with -- with -- or 
something like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

They had a cigar store where my dad, he smoked 
cigars, so he bought the cigars, always. His son 
supposedly had connections, and I reme mber my 
mother bringing him a lo
t of money, how much 
I don™t know, to help us get my fa
ther released from Dachau. I re
me mbe r  a lot of the Jewish me n 
at that time , ma ybe all of them, were arrested. And 
after a -- after, I think it was six weeks, he did 
come home, but that  was after Kristallnacht, I re
me mber. Now, Kristallnacht, we were one of the 
few, ma ybe -- I have no record of this, but they 
didn™t come  to our house, 
but -- or to our Jewish 
friends homes, they were all -- I remember going to
 a close friend of my parents, to their house, 
and I reme mber what it looked like in there. It 
wa s, yeah, just -- they destroyed everything, even 
the -- they went through closets a
nd cut the -- cut the clothes dow
n, they -- they -- they pulled -- 
i-in the kitche n they pulled the 
cabinets down and -- and 
-- and it was a wreck, I reme mber that. I 
come  back to this because I don™
t want to -- I wa nt -- want you 
know about that, I don™t want to 
forget it. But when my father came back, we di
dn™t know when or -- I 
-- all I remembe r  is I 
looked down and he looked like a walking skel
eton, like a walking dead ma n. He wa s quite a 
robust ma n and he had -- he ha -- was in terrible
 shape when he -- when he came back. Of course 
he was not -- he wasn™t supposed to tell an 
-- anybody, you know, what -- what happened, but the 
stories we heard from him, I -- I don™t reme mber  if he
 told us that right away, 
or if he told us that 
later, the things that went  on in Dachau, that they were -- but 
that time it was wintertime, they 
were -- the only clothes they had one was their 
underwear and a -- a pa jama -like -- like outfit. 
They were up in the morning at -- very early in
 the morning and stood at 
attention for two hours. 
Some  were not able to do that and they collap
sed. Some  had -- reme mber him telling us they -- 
they took fire hoses and stuck it
 in their mouth and drowned them. I re me mber my cousin Siggy 
was in Dachau and he was in the same  barr
acks. Seems like it was num -- number -- barrack 
number nine, and the -- the politic
al prisoners that were there were
 the -- they were the -- what™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
17 
 
the right word for that, they were the -- they 
were in command of the 
barracks. His name  was 
Bellow, nickname , probably a nickname  they gave 
him. Starved him, beat him. But anyway, he -
- he -- he got in -- he -- he got out and came home. 
Q: Can I -- can I go back for a second -- 

A: Sure. 

Q: -- to Kristallnacht.  

A: Sure, ther e are a lot of things that  I forget. 

Q: Didn™t some thing happen with your grandfat
her™s -- didn™t some body c o me  into your house, 
some  thugs, that they were going to do some
thing and your grandfather some how stopped them 
because he ha d helped -- 

A: Well -- 

Q: Do you recall that?   

A: -- you know that -- I don™t.  
Q: Mm. 
A: Very [indecipherable] possible. 

Q: Cause it just seems odd that they wouldn™
t -- they would not come  into your house. 
A: They did -- they had [indecipherable] and I re
me mber they had a -- they put a -- a -- a yellow 
plaque on our -- we had a big -- big two iron [indeci
pherable] big gate in fr
ont that went to the 
back -- into our backyard, and 
two SR me n stood there to ma ke 
sure that -- that nobody would 
come  to see us. They -- they probably stayed th
ere for several days, but they never came to the 

house, they never touched our furniture. As far 
as I know we -- we were the only ones. We  mi ght 
not have been, you know, but because all of my -- the home -- my friend™s homes wer e  -- were 

destroyed.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

Q: Do you reme mber that night at all?  Do you 
reme mber being afraid, do you reme mber staying 
in your house in your -- i-in some  special pl ace in the house? 

A: I don™t. 

Q: You don™t. Do you reme mber hearing noises? 

A: The next day I -- 
I -- no, no, I -- I -- 
Q: You don™t reme mber screaming -- 

A: -- I don™t reme mber, no. 

Q: -- or beatings or anything? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, because we were the only Jews on that street -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- see? And the rest they were all -- there were no ghettos. 
Q: Right. 
A: They lived all over town, had shoe stores, furn
iture stores. Some  of my friend -- my -- my fr-
friend™s fathers were in, you know, ha -- couple 
of will lawyers. There were -- Goodsha k, he 
dealt in hides. All different trades. 

Q: Do you reme mber -- yes? 

A: Now I -- what I do reme mber is that my -- that my best friend, they we re deported back to 

Poland, and I think that was in 
-- I™m not sure -- in ™36 to 
™37, early, it was 
early already. 
Q: This was your best friend? 

A: Th -- my best friend, Manfred. Yeah, they -- he
 -- they had to go back to Koloma ya. This was 
a -- we were really close, and it -- 
those were bad, bad times, yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
19 
 
Q: Do you reme mber the day he left? 
A: I -- yeah -- yes. But then I reme -- I also re
me mber that he -- Mr. Rabla was able to come  
back once, he had -- was for some thing, I don™t re
me mber, all the -- and he -- he stopped in, he 
told us where -- where he was, but we were 
-- never got to -- you know, we never heard from 
them again. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: Never heard from them again, no. Of course by 
that time we were pretty well isolated from 
the -- the rest of the -- 
of the -- of the popul
ation, all social events were
 only within the Jewish 
community. But first, you know, they
 -- I -- I reme mber this because
 they talk about it today, the 
Kulturbund, we had that -- the -- we
 had concerts, and I reme mber going to a concert in Koblenz 
in the synagogue and the Gestapo people were 
-- I reme mber them being there. They -- I 

reme mber enjoying a concert. Of course, you 
know, when you™re a 
kid, you look at things 
altogether different, you know, than -- it wa
s never -- I-I never took it all that serious. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Except for what happened to my -- 

Q: Your father. 

A: My father. 

Q: Right. So it -- but it must have been very st
range living on your street 
with n -- with no Jewish 
-- other Jewish people. Di d peopl
e talk with you, did they -- 
A: Oh yes, oh the kids all -- we were -- 

Q: It was okay? 

A: Oh yeah, we all --  we -- we played until -- until the day we left . 

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
20 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: How interesting. 

A: I -- I remember when -- when we left in my -- 
in the ki  -- children™s transport to Belgium, the 

-- my dad hired a -- he was -- we still had -- we -- 
he was able to hire a taxi to take us to the 
railroad station with our heavy suitcases, you 
know. Kids would run along the taxi and they 
waved goodbye to us. Of course, that was in ™39. 

Q: Right. 

A: That was ™39. 

Q: Let -- let me ask you about your father comi ng 
back. Did he -- did he look as if he had been 
starved for those six weeks? 

A: Oh yes, he -- he was -- he -- he had lost a lo
t of weight, his eyes sunk back in his head. He -- 

he wasn™t the same  any more. Wa s the -- I 
-- I -- I -- I -- I know it 
was the -- they were 
mi streated, beaten, starved.  
Q: Did -- when you saw him through the window, when he walked up, cause you didn™t know he 
was comi ng, right? 

A: No, we -- I wa -- 

Q: Did you --  

A: -- I reme mber looking down into the -- because we lived on the first floor, I remember him 

standing there. 

Q: Did you run down to him?  Do you reme mber ? 

A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: I™m sure I did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
21 
 
Q: Yeah. Do you reme mber talking with him at 
some  point soon after he came back into -- 
A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. 

Q: Did he seem very different to you, not ju
st physically, but psyc
hologically?  Do you -- do you 
have any -- you don™t reme mber. 

A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I reme mb er we -- I reme mber they wanted 
to get us out of Germany a ny way possible. 

Q: That is -- right. 

A: Any way possible. And -- and -- and -- and -- a
nd they did and we left 
in the -- guess it was in 

the spring of ™39. 

Q: Mm, mm, in April. 

A: He -- it wa s before that. 

Q: It was before that that you got out? 
A: Yeah, yes, before April, I think, I thi
nk -- think like it was in
 March, seems to me. 
Q: Huh. 
A: February, March, I don™t reme mbe r . 

Q: So it was cold? 

A: Probably. 

Q: Probably cold. Did -- you weren™
t against leaving your
 parents and your grandparents at that 
mo ment?  

A: Well -- 

Q: Did it feel -- it must have felt odd, t
hough, you and your younger brother, you were -- 
A: Of course, you know, of course it was.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
22 
 
Q: You were almost -- 
A: But still --  

Q: Yeah? 

A: -- still when you™re -- how old was I, 12? 

Q: Yes, you were going to turn 13 soon, yeah. 

A: 12 -- 12, yeah, I reme mber I was Bar Mitzvahed 
in Belgium. Didn™t know what to expect, but 
it -- it was -- of course it was hard, you know. My 
-- my brother went to a 
--- a -- he -- we knew 
this, he went to a -- a f -- a -- one
 family that came from Kobl enz that lived there, and I went to a 
fa mily that my dad used to do business with in -- in -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- in -- in Germany. 

Q: But let me -- let me ask you some thing. When
 your parents finally -- I don™t know, did they 

sit you down and they said, we™ve ma de arrangeme
nts, you™re leaving tomorrow, you™re leaving 
next week. 
A: Yes. 

Q: How did they -- how did they do it?  Do you recall? 

A: I don™t reme mber. I --
 it™s a long time ago. 
Q: I understand that.  

A: Yes, it™s a long time  ago. 

Q: Do you reme m -- 

A: I reme mb er that  it was -- 

Q: Tough. 

A: -- gonna be for good, you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
23 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- because we weren™t sure of
 -- of anything at that time. 
Q: So you weren't sure you™re -- 

A: If we were gonna -- 

Q: -- you would see them again. 

A: -- see each other again [indeci
pherable]. Our plans were, of c
ourse, that they would -- that 
some ti me  in the future we  would reunited, but we 
weren't sure of anything. They weren™t sure of 
being able to get out. 

Q: Right. 

A: As far as we knew it was goodbye for -- ma ybe for good. 

Q: Did anybody cry? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 
A: I don™t know. Probably did. I know I -- I was suppos
ed to look after my brother, and that was 
-- 
Q: That was a big responsibility, right? 

A: Yeah. [indecipherable]. Sorry. 

Q: It™s okay. What™s going through your mi nd? 

A: Oh well. But we got to Belgium, we -- the fa
mily I lived with were very good to me , and the 
fa mily Guy was with, they were good to him.  

Q: Ernie, let me  ask you some thing. When you said
 you were t -- you were told to take care of 
your brother, what -- what just happened to 
you?  What do you -- what were you recalling that 
ma de you feel what you just -- do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
24 
 
A: I™ll come  to that. The -- now, the people I stay
ed with, were -- came  from -- of course, came 
from Ger ma ny, too. His name  was Erik Schlafi. 
I don™t know if I -- if I 
told this to anybody 
before, yeah. He was the -- the son-in-law of th
e people my father used to do business with. He 
had an import export business in
 -- in -- in Antwerp. He was th
ere since 1933 already. He came 
from Essen, and he was the German heavyw
a -- heavyweight champi
on o -- o-of -- boxing 
champion of Germany, a mong other things. He had 
-- he had to leave in 
™33, just as soon as 
Hitler came to power because he -- at  that  time he
 was a me mber of the Communist party, but he 
was a Communist that like -- like I™m a China ma
n, you know?  But that -- that was the thing to do 
at that time , he went to the university and -- 
and the k -- and the -- and his parents were very 
well-to-do, and he -- and there was 
a lot of poverty in Germany at that -- at that time, and -- and 
he wanted social programs to help the poor. And so 
that -- that -- the univer
sity students that -- 
the way they tell me, it was the thing to do at 
that time, to belong to 
the Communist party. And 
there was some -- Goering was giving a speech 
in -- as -- the -- the way I reme mber it, in 
Munich. And they got into a tu
ssle an-and -- and -- and -- and Erik let him -- hit him good and 
hard, and they had a -- they had a -- a law -- he
 had a lawsuit, Goering brought a lawsuit against 
him. So just as soon as they came to power, they
 left Germany right away, he had to leave. And 
they were very good to me until the Germans came 
to [indec i pherabl e] th-they came  to Antwerp 
May eighth as far as I reme mber. 

Q: Right, right.  

A: The eighth of May. And a week before that, he 
-- a week or two before that, he packed up his 
fa mily and left. 

Q: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that, but 
you™re there for almost 
a year with him -- 
A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

A: No, no, no, no, no, no.

to the Hallenser shul there, a

and oh I helped, you know, I, some t i me  I-I helped, but -- went to school, not for very long, but I 

did go to school in Belgium. He would -- ther

he would -- he would 
always take me  along, I was -- we were good friends. 

Q: We re you the eldest, or wa
s André and Gabi were younger? 
A: No, they were -- they we

28 
 
Q: Mm. 
A: My parents finally got a -- some  kind of a tran
sit visa through England, 
to come to the United 
States. They stopped in -- they stopped in -- ex
cuse me  -- in -- they stopped in Belgium and 
Antwerp -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- on their way to England. 

Q: So you saw them?

Q: You don™t. 

A: I don™t think so.

29 
 
A: Don™t reme mber. 
Q: You don™t reme mber.

A: No. 

Q: -- with these people?  No.

Q: Not even with the folks 
that Guy was staying with? 
A: I don™t think so. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Right. 
A: But I don™t think so, because I know they were
 not allowed to take any -- anythi ng out of 
Germany any more, except for some  furniture, 
some  -- which we never got anyway, which for 
some  reason we never got.  
Q: Could they take some  money out ?

Okay. 

A: Don™t reme mber any more. 

Q: Right.  

A: Don™t reme mber it. Li-Like I 
said, you know, there™s so ma ny thi
ngs that -- that I forget and 
then some times I™ m re minded of it, you know, a
nd then the -- then it come s back to me. 
Q: Right. Memory is like a maze, you know, it st
arts -- it pops up and it -- then hides. 
A: Sometimes my brother reme mber
s things that -- that I don™t. 
Q: Right. 

A: That™s how it is.  

Q: Let™s take a break -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: -- because the tape is going to stop soon. 

A: Okay. 
End of Tape One 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
31 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Ernie, when we last -- when 
we were on the last tape, we were 
talking about the 
fa ct that after 
Belgium was occupied -- attacked
 and occupied, the Levys left. 
A: They left before that, though, before they -- 
Q: What did they say to you?  I 
mean, there you are, they™re suppos
ed to be taking care of you, so 
they leave with their tw
o kids, to go to France? 
A: War time , and it™s war here. I knew -- 
I knew he had to leave, he had to go. 
Q: He wa -- but he wasn™t going to take you? 

A: No. 

Q: Why, do you think? 

A: They had a small car. He had his wife andtwo children. I understood. I had no hard feelings. I 

reme mber he ma de arrangeme nts f - -  I don™t even
 reme mber if Guy was there or not, that I 
would stay with some body. And he left a cert
ain amount of money. Seems like it was 600 francs. 
And they were supposed to take -- that was sup 
-- that was supposed to take care of us for a 
month or so.  

Q: So, you reme mber some thing a little bit differen
tly than Guy, he recall
s that you came  to hi m 
with the Weinbergs -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and then the We inbergs left, and then 
you were alone. Di y-you don™t remembe r  it that 
way?  

A: I know I stayed with this family for a ce -- 
for a certain amount of 
time , and there were -- 
seems like two other children, kids my age.
 I don™t reme mbe r  if Guy was there or not. 
Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
32 
 
A: But that came to an end, after the m
oney ran out they told me  that -- go. 
Q: Just go. 

A: Go. And then Guy and I, we -- I reme mber 
wa -- We inbergs were gone. Where they went, 
what happened, I don™t reme mber, and by that time  
of course, the Germans were -- had occupied 
Antwerp, and we had no place to go. We found a 
place down towards where the Jewish section 
was. There was a house. If some body told us about
 it, I don™t know. We  stay
ed up in the attic, it 
was a -- the house was c-completely abandoned, ther
e was no pi -- as far as the -- there was 
nobody else living there. We stayed 
up in the attic, I know that. 
Q: Why did you stay in the atti
c?  Did you think it was safest? 
A: I don™t know any mo re why. I kn
ow that™s where we stayed.  
Q: Did you have anything with you?  
Did you take a little suitcase? 
A: Oh yeah, we -- we -- we had our clothes -- 

Q: You did? 
A: -- yeah, we -- we had our clothes, oh yea
h, yeah. I™m sure. I don™t reme mber packing my 
stuff, but I™m very sure we -- we had it. A
nd I™m sure I was looking 
out for my brother. 
Q: We re you frightened?  
You™re 14 years old. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you feel like a grown-up kid? 

A: I felt like I had to survive some how.  

Q: Mm. 

A: Didn™t ma -- didn™t ma ke much differen
ce how. And I didn™t feel
 sorry for myself. 
Q: You didn™t? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
33 
 
A: No. I didn™t see how anybody could. There wa s no 
point in it. I know there was some  Jewish 
organizations left there because I know we went th
ere often, and -- to eat. 
Like they had li-like a 
soup kitchen, like. I know every once in awhile 
we would -- there was a ma n, a Jewi sh ma n. I o -
- it seems like his name was Rabinowitz or someth
ing like that [indecipher
able] that would bring 
us a loaf of bread off and on. He wouldn™t br i
ng it, we would meet him s o me place and he would 
give us a loaf of bread. Don™t reme mber much 
about that time, but I know we lived there for 
s o me  t i me .   

Q: And how -- how is Guy doing?  Does he take  on 
your attitude, or is he, because he™s five years 
younger, which ma kes him -- 

A: We ll about that time I was how old, 13, right?  

Q: I -- well -- 

A: 13 - 14 -- 

Q: 14. 
A: 13 - 14 -- 
Q: You were 14. 

A: Yeah, 14. 

Q: Cause it™s 1940, it™s after May of 1940. 

A: Right, right, yeah, right, yeah, ™40. Yeah, I was 14, sure. 

Q: Right?  

A: Sure. 

Q: But he is nine. 

A: And he is nine. We -- it must have been at
 that time too, the Germans were bivouacked in a 
park, and they have all kinds of food and we 
would go and talk German -- I -- I know we -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
34 
 
stayed up nights thinking of stories to tell them. 
We told them that by -- that we were in Belgium 
with our parents, and that they were interned by 
the French. We must have heard that some place, 
sure we didn™t fish it out of the sky. They believ
ed us anyway, and we were -- we were left alone 
in Antwerp. Look, there was food. That™s what we
 went for, we want
ed some thing to eat. 
Q: Did you have I.D. cards? 
A: No. 

Q: Nothing? 

A: No, no. 

Q: So they didn™t ask for anything? 

A: No, no. They were run of the mill soldiers, you know, they didn™t really care. We  didn™t ha d -- 

they -- all they knew is we 
spoke German with them --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- and told them we were Germa ns and -- an
d they gave us food. And that™s how we me t 
Madame Marian in the park -- 

Q: This is -- 

A: -- just out of circumstances. 

Q: Right, and so this is the same  park wher
e the German sol diers are. So you go there -- 
A: Maybe [indecipherable] 

Q: -- daily, ma ybe?   

A: I don™t know any mo re. We  wer 
-- went there, I know that. And -- 
Q: Wa  -- if -- let me  just ask you now, before 
we talk about Marian, wh
en you went to the soup 
kitchen -- to the -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
35 
 
Q: -- where the Jewish
 organization was -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- did you ask them to get in touch with 
your parents in England?
 Did you know where your 
parents were in England? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You knew where they were? 

A: Yes. I know it today yet. 

Q: Where were they? 

A: Eight Mornington Terrace. Ask me [indeciphe
rable] this morning and I won™t know it, you 
know, or yesterday, or the day before. Yes, we 
knew, and at that time  wer e  we -- did we 
correspond with them?  I don™t see how, because we didn™t ha ve a permanent address. 

Q: Right, but I™m wonde ring if you -- 

A: There mu st have been some  ti -- time  that we did not -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- correspond with them. 

Q: Which must have frig
htened them terribly. 
A: Oh, I™m sure that  this -- sure it di d. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I don™t know how -- don™t reme mber how l
ong we were like that. Then one day we me t 
this -- this Be lgian lady, and she saw where we 
got -- that we were able
 to get along with the 
German sol diers there, and th
en -- and she took us in.  
Q: And you trusted her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
36 
 
A: Well, trust, no trust, didn™t have much to 
lose. Wa s going to be better on -- than where we 
were. We  went home wi th her and we  stayed th
ere for some  time. She -- of course, she took 
advantage of us because we were able to get -- people were hungry. 

Q: Right. 

A: People would go on bicycles into the country to get food, scrounge food. We  found a place 

there, it was a German ba rracks 
not too far from the -- where we
 lived, and we got food there. 
We got the -- I reme mbe r  we got the potato peels,
 we got all the potato peels. They were -- they 
make great pancakes, the -- just the peels. 

Q: Really? 

A: Oh, great pancakes, yes. You know there™s a --
 beside the peel, there 
is -- there™s -- there™s 
some  potato left on it, or -- yea
h, we lived well. And I got a job 
in the military bakery, as a 
German. 

Q: As a German.  
A: As a -- 
Q: Nobody asked you whether you were -- did they
 ask you are you Jewish?  They didn™t. They 
didn™t assume. 

A: They know a Jew wouldn™t dare do that.  

Q: Right.  

A: Therefore, well. 

Q: Tell me  a little bit about Marian before you ge
t this job. What is she 
like, that you reme mber. 
A: She -- I don™t think they were
 married. Maybe they we -- I -- 
I don™t really know, to Pierre. 
He worked for the -- he worked for the trolley car
s. Wa sn™t a conductor, he took care of the -- of 
the rail and so on. And they lived in
 a -- in a -- in -- which is very
 common in -- in -- in Antwerp, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
37 
 
in a below ground apartment they had. And -- forgot  the name  of the str
eet now. And they fixed 
up a room upstairs for us -- 
Q: Really? 

A: -- some how, yeah, yeah. What?  There -- ther
e was a bed, and I reme mber a window that I 
looked out of, I reme mb er looking out, and I wo
uld see the airplanes comi ng back fr om raids 
over Germany that -- looked at th
e wings, there were ho-holes in 
them t his big, 
they look right 
through the wings and you wonder how they could fl
y. They were always -- I -- I had a -- a thing 
there that I would reme mber some days th-that 
I [indecipherable] forget 
this day. I™ve had days 
before that that I -- I™m -- I™m thinking, you know, 
that -- that there will be
 a time that I will think 
back on this, that we would, you know, surviv
e it, you know. I reme mber looking out that 
window wa -- one night and ma ybe one day, watc
hing those planes comi ng back. But anyway, 
we -- we stayed there. 

Q: Was she kind? 
A: Yeah. She was good to us, yeah. Course she ha
d a lot of advantages, too. When I worked at 
the military bakery I would bring home fl our every day in my thermos, fill it up with fl our. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. And the guys that I worked with, they
 thought I was German. Some of the m -- there 
were a couple of sailors there, 
hated me . And I know we got into 
a tussle at one time and these 
sailors, they wa -- they -- 
they were tough, you know, I reme mber one of them throwing me  
[indecipherable] seems like it was 15 feet behind them. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. And still I got along with th
em, you know, I just couldn™t let on -- 
Q: Why wer e  they fighting with you, you were a kid? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
38 
 
A: I was a German, though, th-they thought I was German. 
Q: Oh, oh, I see, that was a Belgian soldier, uh-huh. 

A: Not Belgian soldiers. 

Q: Not Belgian sol -- 

A: They were people working there for the -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- for -- for the German soldiers, for the military bakery, ri ght. 

Q: [indecipherable] right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So did this put you 
in a funny sort of -- 
A: Sure. 

Q: -- I don™t know, feeling, here you are Jewish
 and against what th
ese people are doing -- 
A: Of course, yeah -- 
Q: -- and yet you™re working for them. 
A: Yeah, yeah, but I couldn™t let on, except for on
e time. And I worked there for quite awhile. 
And that [indecipherable], the guy that ran the -- 
the German officer that ran the place came from 
Ha mburg, I forgot his name . But that time I was 
15 and supposed to get a passport and he helped 
me  write a letter and -- we were so -- we had a 
lot more luck than brains, that they didn™t find 
out. Yeah, at the Christmas 1940, I -- I™m 
sure I told this story to some body. 
Q: Tell it. 

A: Now, by that time the -- th-that we stayed w
ith the Madame  Marian, we were in touch with 
my parents. And my parents by that time were in
 the United States already. They figured they 
could help us, at least as well fr
om the United States as -- better
 then from England. If it would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
39 
 
have been anybody else but my mother, we would 
never have ma de it. She -- of course this I 
found out later, you know, she ran and ran and wr
ote and wrote and -- and -- and -- and she was 

in touch with Senator Wagner, she came  to Wa s hi
ngton several times to get 
-- to get us visas for 
the United St ates. Where was I? Where Marian -- 

Q: [indecipherable] Christma s party. 

A: Yeah, we went -- yeah. At the -- the Germans i
nvited us to a Christma s party, the soldiers did, 
in 1900 and -- was that 1
940 -- ™41 -- no, ™40 -- 
Q: ™40. 

A: -- ™40 -- ‚40 

Q: I think ™40. 

A: Yeah, for -- had to be 1940. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. Couldn™t refuse, you know, so we went. 
Big long table, one side
 was Christmas tree. 
People came in, mostly soldiers, some civilians. 
The guy sitting right across from me -- now, we 
-- I told you I™m -- we were in touch with my pare
nts, we tried to get papers to come  to the 
United States. Had to get a German passport. We  
went to the German au-authorities that -- at -- 
in -- in -- in -- in Antwerp to 
get this German pas sport, legitima te, as Jews. The guy that was -- 
handled our -- some  of our [indecipherable] sa
t right across from me. I thought my hea r t was 
going to stop right then and th
ere. Never -- did -- didn™t he recognize us? Did he know?  There 
were no -- they weren™t all bad. Ninety-five pe
rcent were bad, you know, 95 percent I can swear 
to it, they we re bad, you know. But there were 
five percent were good. Be
cause things happened 
in -- in -- in -- in Berlin that
 I didn™t tell you about, that -- 
Q: Well, we™ll get there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
40 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: So he does not say anything? 

A: Never said anything. 

Q: And he knows that you™re Jewish? 

A: Right. There we sat, and the commandant of 
t he -- of the garrison there, ma de a speech, I™ll 
reme mber the words that you know, we -- we don™t ce
lebrate the birth of a dirty Jew bastard, he 
probably said. We  celebrate the Christma s tree. A
nd I always say to myself, that son-of-a-gun, he 
would have known what™s sitting right next to him 
there. That I remembe r  well. I remember that 
this guy never said anything, too. 

Q: We re other things said that were very unc
omfortable, or wa -was this mainly a -- that you 
r e me mb e r ?  

A: That™s the only thing th
at I reme mber about that. 
Q: That you reme mber. And is Guy with you? 
A: Guy was, yeah.  
Q: Wa s he working with you in the -- in the bakery? 

A: No, no, no, no -- 

Q: He wasn™t. 

A: -- he was too young. 

Q: He was too young. But they knew hi m. Did he 
come  -- cause he wasn™t going to school any 
more. 

A: No, no, he came with me  to get food. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
41 
 
A: Course we™ve always had our 
bicycles nearby, thinki
ng you know that if they catch us, we™re 
going to run. And we had the routes all ma pped out, that we would take. We knew the port of 
Antwerp very well, that we -- we thought we c
ould lose them and we would get away. There was 
a article one day in the German ne wspaper in 
Antwerp [speaks German here]. And they never 
caught the -- believed our story. In
 other words now, there was some  people that knew the real 
stuff, and the military and the newspaper ne
ver di d catch on. So we were just lucky.  
Q: Do you think Marian and Pierre were in dang
er because they were keeping you, if they found 

out you were Jewish? 

A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no, not [indecipherable]. So like I said,you know, we -- things get mi xed up in my head, 

there™s a lot of things that I -- that happened 
while we stayed with them. Among others, they -- I 
was supposed to be deported, and that must have
 been after, wasn™t it?  Anyway, one -- one day 
while I was working in the military barrack and 
we were clea ning socks. There was a ma chine 
there that cleaned the socks,
 with Alphonse [indecipherable] him and me , we were cleaning 
socks. And the Gestapo, you know, you -- you coul
d spot them a mile away, you know. A car 
came in, a convertible car came in --
 in -- into the -- this
 military bakery was in a -- in a fortress 
that was built by Napoleon. Very old fashioned, very 
old -- th-this car pulls 
in and there™s a -- a -
- they caught on with me . And if they catch me , I want some body -- I want Guy to find out, I 

want Guy to know. So I took Alphonse [indecipher
able] that was working with me  there in 
confidence, I told hi m, listen here. I™m afraid. I™m really -- and I told him -- told him the truth, 

told him, hey listen, I™m Jewish. He -- he w
ouldn™t believe it, you know, and then -- but I told 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
42 
 
him, I said, if they catch -- plea
se let -- let my brother know. It wa
s a false alarm. But after tha -- 
after that day, I didn™t dare go back. I didn™t kno
w if he was -- if I could trust him or not. 
Q: But he didn™t know where you lived? 
A: Must have. He was going to let my brother know. 

Q: That™s true. 

A: But anyway, he -- I never went back to work
 there after that, I ne
ver went back. And I -- 
apparently they didn™t -- 

Q: They didn™t do anything. 

A: They -- they didn™t do anything. 

Q: Wa s Marian upset that you stoppe
d working, because [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, because that was a big deal fo
r her, that -- you know, we™d bring flour every 
day. She was upset about it, and I 
know it was before -- must have 
been before that already. They 
called off -- I don™t know who did they c -- the aut
horities told me  to report to the railroad 
station, pack my stuff and -- the 
railroad station. And I 
-- I said to -- you know, that was one of 
the toughest days, I said -- you know, I had to leav
e my brother. I didn™t think I was -- for some 

reason I didn™t think I wa s going to come  back from
 that. We ll, I got to the railroad station and -- 
and Madame Marian went with me , and that -- th
e Belgian that had -- 
organized that, probably 
under the authority of the Germans,
 I guess, I don™t -- I wo -- 
and she talked to one of the 
policeman there, one of the cops 
there, and he went back home.  
Q: Do you know what was said?   

A: I have no idea. 

Q: You don -- 

A: I have no idea.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
43 
 
Q: How come  Guy -- I™m a little confused about some thing.  
A: Ask me . 

Q: If you™re not in -- if you™re not
 -- if you™re not known as Jewish -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- so how is there a notice that you were 
supposed to go down to 
the railway station -- 
A: Well the-- 

Q: -- do you know? 

A: Well, sure. 

Q: Because you had apply -- 

A: The authorities knew that the -- 

Q: Because you had applied. 

A: Yeah, the -- well, the authoriti
es are -- the Belgian author ities also knew I -- knew I was there. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 
A: They knew I was there. 
Q: Right. 

A: When I went to -- to Levys already, they knew that. 

Q: Right. 

A: The only ones that  we had buffa loed were 
the soldiers, the military a-authority there. 
Q: Right. Okay, that ma kes sense. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Did you -- 

A: Because I got -- I got the Belgian papers th-t
hat they -- they™ve got them, the -- they got most 
of my stuff. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
44 
 
Q: Wa s there a J on your -- 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- [indecipherable] passport. There was.  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: On the -- J on the German passport -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- and on the Belgian passport. 

Q: Right. 

A: They put it on too. We ll anyway, 
I -- I -- but then, shortly after 
that, I -- I know that -- that 
summer we were both barefoot, we
 [indecipherable] but that wasn
™t all that uncommo n in -- in 
Antwerp -- 

Q: No?  
A: -- you know, that felt good. 
Q: So what happens in terms of staying with 
Marian, Madame Marian and Pierre? That™s -- 
A: That -- that petered out af
ter that. St -- don™t reme mber a
ny more just how it came  about. 
Anyway, my brother stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Be st. 

Q: How did that happen? 

A: Sure we me t the m through Mr. Rosenbaum. He 
was the cantor of the -- of the Hallenser shul 
there.  

Q: Where you were -- 

A: Bar Mitzvah. 

Q: Bar Mitzvahed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
45 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So he knew you? 

A: Some how we went be -- we went to him, 
got to him, and -- but that time there were no 
services any more, there were no -- and he put me 
up in the shul. There wa s 
a room there that I st 
-- that  I st ayed in. 

Q: With Guy? 

A: No. 

Q: And whe r e™s Guy? 

A: Guy stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Best. 

Q: Ah, ah, I see, right, okay -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: Now, Mr. Best was Jewish, 
Mrs. Best was not, and I guess
 nobody knew that he was Jewish. 
And they had a little girl Guy™s age. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And he just f-fit right in and they
 were extremely good to
 him. Nice people. 
Q: Did you want to stay there,
 or that was not possible? 
A: We ll, it wasn™t possible. I didn™
t really care where I 
stayed, as long as I had a place to stay. 
Q: Right. 

A: And he got me  a job in a -- in a p -- as a plumbe
r, and I got to -- to -- the work papers yet. I 
don™t know if you got them or not. I think I -- I 
still got ‚em, anyway. 
I didn™t know anything 
about plumbing. All I reme mber is the f -- the first j
ob I got that th -- that 
they gave me  there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
46 
 
I had to split a piece of steel in ha lf with a ha
mmer and a chisel and I reme mber that thumb was 
this thick. I hit my thumb more ofte
n than I hit the -- hit the chisel. 
Q: So did anybody train 
you, or they just -- 
A: That was part of the training, yeah -- 

Q: That was part of the training -- 

A: -- that was -- yes. And that was the time we 
we nt down to -- there was a Mrs. Arum down on 
Kebitsplatte, one of the ma in thoroughpare -- fareswhere they -- right next 
to the railroad -- near 
the railroad station where the 
-- where the diamond [indecipher
able] was -- where the diamond -- 
the exchange was. We  would go there periodically 
to the rest -- she st ill had a rest aurant there, 
and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- 
and -- and Jewish -- th-the Be lgia
n Jews would come  there, and 
she would -- we would eat there off and on. And on Shabbas, I know I went to Mr. Rosenbaum. 

What the connection between the shul and him 
was at that time, I don™t really know. I know 
there was a Mrs. Kleinman that he lped us 
get papers. I reme mber going to the American 
consulate, the -- an America [indecipherable
] for our visa. Guy and I both went there. 
Q: You saw Guy very often?  We re you living wa
 -- was the synagogue where you were staying -
- 

A: Not very far apart, yes, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Not very far. 

A: Yeah, I saw him. Yeah. 

Q: Both of you were optimistic, 
aren™t you, in some  way, as kids? 
A: I don™t know what we were. I don™t know what we were. 

Q: We ll, you weren™t pessimi stic, you 
didn™t get depressed and stop moving. 
A: Oh no, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
47 
 
Q: You™re always -- you™
re always adjusting. 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There were othe
r people that -- there were other people that 
were -- Mrs. Dessaur, Mrs. Dessa
ur and -- forgot his name , and 
her -- her boyfriend. We -- I -- I 
went there every once in awhile. 
I™ve got -- I™ve got his picture in
 -- in a note, in back of it, 
someplace. But when the time came that we were s
upposed to go to -- to Berlin for our span -- 
we needed a Spanish transit visa, we had to go --
 we had to be in a neutral country to get our 
American visa.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And I think it was this Mrs. Kleinman that
 -- and it was impossible 
to do, to go -- you know, 
get to Germany and -- and -- and --
 and get this Spanish transit vi
sa. She got us a paper from the 
commandant of Belgium, Antwerp, who supposedly ha
d a Jewish girlfriend th
at -- that she knew. 
Anyway, we  got -- I -- I think his -- his name  wa
s  Ascher, he got it, you 
know, that the -- this 
paper that it gi -- give us
 permission to go to Berlin. 
Q: But this was after you get a me ssage from your mother. 

A: Oh yes, we were -- we had -- we steadily 
corresponded with our -- with our mo ther, my 
parents.  

Q: And -- and me ssages are going ba
ck and forth to the synagogue 
or to the Best home , where 
your brother is?  Do you know?  Do you reme mbe r? 

A: Don™t reme m -- I™m -- I™m su
re it came to me, but -- 
Q: And this is all by ma il, or as -- 

A: -- by mail. 

Q: By just regular ma il? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
48 
 
A: By ma il, yes. And we got these [indecipherable] 
sure we were asked to come  to the consulate, 
the American consulat e. We were not at war at  the time. And I reme mber spending hours sitting 
on a bench there until it was our turn
 and then we had got a physical there. Unless you were in 
good shape, you know, forget it, you know, they w
ouldn™t -- they wouldn™t take you. And the 
time ca me  that we were supposed to go to -- to 
Germany to get the -- th
e Spanish transit visa. 
Q: Were you dressed well to go to this phys
ical?  Did you have shoes [indecipherable] 
A: Oh ye -- oh yeah -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- we -- we were okay in Belgium. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you passed the physical? 

A: Yeah, passed the physical and -- and everythi
ng. We  had -- we still ha
d to be in a neutral 
country. Wh y -- why -- Belgium wa s occupied by -- 
by the Germans, it had to be the next -- the 
nearest -- the nearest neutral country was s -- wa s Spain, and in orde
r to -- to get that, we had to 

be th -- had to go to Berlin, that was the closes
t Spanish consul. So we packed our stuff and we 
had the necessary papers, and we were on our way to Berlin. 

Q: Wa s that very nerve-racking, becau
se now you™re going back to the -- 

A: Oh, oh yes, yes, didn™t like it a bit. We  
felt very uncomf -- and on the -- and on the train and 

starting out in Antwerp, there we
re a lot of Belgians that we
nt to work in Germany. Some  
German sol diers that -- that went
 on leave to Germany. And we were sitting in that compartment, 
you know, with -- and we didn™t wa nt anybody to know who we were. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
49 
 
A: And we got to the -- must have been th
e border between Belgiu
m and Germany. I don™t -- 
everybody had to get off the train, papers got ex
amined, and I think it was the SS, I™m not a 
hundred percent sure. Hah, [speaks German here]. Two Jewish boys. Come  on, we™re going to 
shoot you guys. And they took us in to a -- to 
a room, interrogated us, went through our luggage. 
Guy ma de some  kind of a rema rk, they slappe
d hi m around. Until I came  up with that paper from 

this Comma ndant Ascher, they let us go.  

Q: Hm. 

A: And we got -- I don™t know, we got back onthe train, and next st
op was Berlin, you know, 

that™s quite a -- quite 
a -- quite a bit -- 
Q: Was Guy very hurt? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no, no. 
Q: They didn™t hit you? 
A: No, never touched me . 

Q: That mus t  have been 
pretty scary for you two, though. 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, sure. 

Q: Those guys. 

A: Oh yeah, we -- we -- come  out, we shoot you guys. 

Q: Just like that. 

A: Yeah, well, what are you going to do, you know, we
 couldn™t run away, they were right there. 
They had rifl es. But anyway, so we -- we got to Berlin and --

Q: Did you know where to go? 

A: We  had -- we had an address where to go. 

Q: And whe r e was that? 

A: I think it was 26 Ha mburgerstrasse. 

Q: Mm-h m. The Jewish Ho me  for th e Aged? 

A: It was supposed to be a Jewi
sh home  for the aged, yes. We 
didn™t know how to get there, how 
far it was. We had to ask some body, and we always
 knew that the army  were not as -- they were 
not as bad as anybody else. And so I -- I asked a sold
ier, where is so and so and so. He explained 
it to us, but it was a long ways away. We 
had our suitcases that we were dragging. 
Q: So you walked? 
A: Oh yeah, what do you think? 
Q: I don™t know. 

A: On horseback?

A: Yes. I reme mber going to th
e -- going to the railway station 
in Antwerp. The name escape me , 
Mrs. -- Jewish lady, young lady that worked -- th
at had -- that one time worked for Mr. Levy. 
And I reme mber the dress she wore, her dress we
re the colors of the Belgian flag. A lot of 
Belgians did that at that time , the ones that dared. 

Q: Right. 

A: And we told her what -- that we eventually would wind up -- you know, hoping to wind up in 

the United St ates, we said that this -- the -- the 
[indecipherable] and then -- and then in -- in 
Flemish, you know, she told -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- to -- if yo -- if you get to
 New York to greet Mr. Levy. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We  were walking in Berlin on this -- you know,
 going the direction that we were told to go 
and then all of a sudden we saw this ma n comi
ng down the street with a Mogen-David on his -- 
said Jude -- Jude. So I went up to him, you kno
w, says, hey, I™m a Jew too, you know, I want to 
go there and there. He said what, you know, he -- he
 was afraid to talk to -- how come  you™re not 
wearing a -- how dare you walk arou
nd without the -- a Jewish star?  So
 I -- I -- I th -- explained 
to him that we just got off a train and we didn™
t know anything about it. We
ll, he told us again, 
you know, which way to go and some how got there. 
There were not ma ny peopl
e there, but I -- I 
don™t -- don™t know if they expected us, they didn™t expect us. I think they did, I ma  -- I think 

expect us. So me how there was communication. The -- 

Q: We re there children -- ot
her children there your age? 
A: There were -- it seems like a 
few child -- there were more -- there were several boys older 
than I was. At that time I was 15, they were 18 
- 19 - 20. I reme mber there was one man there, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
52 
 
was a -- a furrier. And I know he was working on 
some  fur, and he were there for much longer 
than I though he would be there. But he had all kinds of diffic
ulties [indecipherable]. He had to 
get German papers. I reme mber one day being in th
e -- in the -- we had to get some  papers from 
the SS, and I was told to move some  furniture, 
and I spent ma ybe a couple, two or three days 
there, ma ybe more, moving furniture for them. But 
we -- we got the -- we 
got whatever we were 
supposed to get there, we  finally got it. 
Q: What -- what were your accomm
odations like at the Jewish home? 
A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: You don™t -- you don™t reme mber. 

A: I don™t reme mber.  

Q: Did you ma inly s -- have to stay insi
de, did you work, was there some thing -- 
A: We ll, we worked there, worked on that railro
ad station, stuffing bags with straw, because the 

deportations had just started then. But we took 
it all in stride. Didn™
t get much to eat. 
Q: You didn™t? 

A: No, but that didn™t bother us 
either. It must have been enough to
 -- to k -- to keep
 us alive. We  
would -- crazy thing, I -- I did such foolish th
ings. We  went sight-seei
ng and took our jackets, 
you know, so they wouldn™t see that we were Jewi
sh [indecipherable] our arms. Things that we 
really sh-shouldn™t have done, taken [ind
ecipherable] take a chance like that. 
Q: Why did you do it? 

A: Why did we -- 

Q: Why did you do that? 

A: Sight see.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
53 
 
A: Didn™t know better. Should have known better.
 We  knew things were
 serious and still -- 
Q: Wa s one -- did you do this 
ma ny times?  A number of times? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Once you lost your papers? 

A: I wish you wouldn™t have re
mi nded me  of that, but I did. 
Q: Mm. 

A: Lost the papers. I mean, that™s what -- ever
ything hinged on that, that 
was getting out and not 
getting out. I always kept them with me . So
me how I left them laying some place. Called the 
police, they found them. I got
 them -- got them back. 
Q: All of them? 

A: All of them.  

Q: And wha t  did the police say, cause the -- 

A: I don™t reme mber. 
Q: You don™t reme mber. 
A: I really don™t. 

Q: Mm. 

A: It isn™t that I don™t want to 
reme mber, I don™t reme mber that.  
Q: Maybe it was too fright
ening to even see them. 
A: Yes. I never thought we™d get 
them back. So there were time
s, you know, that -- that I was 
desperate, and I™m sure my brother was. 

Q: Are you also able to hear fr
om your mother and father -- 
A: In -- in -- 

Q: -- in Berlin, or not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
54 
 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No, no.  

Q: So they™re waiting to hear th
at you™ve gotten the papers -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- to leave Germany and leave Belgium.  

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And we didn™t hear fr
om them all the time they were on -- til we got to 
the United St ates. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Until we got our --  fi nally di d get our Spanish transit vi sa. 

Q: Did you have to go ma ny ti me s to 
try to get the papers, or only once? 
A: To the -- even more than once. 

Q: More than once. 
A: More than once, oh yes. Took s -- took si
x weeks until we -- you know, w-we -- we spent 
maybe a week moving fur-furniture for -- for these -- 
Q: Did any adult go with you when you went to 
get these papers, or 
did you always go alone 
with Guy? 

A: As far as I reme mber going -- going alone. We
 were told where to go and we went. I don™t 

reme mber anybody coming along, but if some body did, I don™t reme mber . 

Q: Right. And they didn™t question you, here are 
two kids, what are you doing, is this -- bu-but if 
your papers were okay, they believed it, I guess,
 huh?  Do you think you were in danger of being 
kept in Berlin and deported? 

A: It™s all possible, sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
55 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: What would have happened 
if we didn™t get the Spanish tr
ansit visa?  We would have -- you 
know, all -- I don™t know what our 
lot wou -- would have been. 
Q: Right. Were you hearing about th
e war at this time?  Because in
 June is the attack on the 
Soviet Union, so do you see more soldie
rs, or you™re hear
ing very little? 
A: We  -- sure we knew about the war, sure we 
knew, but that didn™t -- one
 day we walked across 
the street  in -- in -- in Berlin, 
and before we even crossed the st
reet, a lady came walking up to us 
and she said, boys, be proud of that -- she was 
not Jewish, you know -- be
 proud of the -- of your 
star. You know, be -- be strong, you know. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. There were some , you know, what -- 
when people ask me  today, you know, a-about the 
Germans, you know, of c o -- of course, you know, 
after the war when I -- I -- when I were -- 
when I came  back as a soldier, there were
 no Nazis, you couldn™t find any, you know, there 
weren™t any, you know. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And wha t  I always [indecipherable] they were
 the best and the worst. Out of the di -- 95 

percent I wouldn™t give you a nickel for. And fi
ve -- and out of the five percent, ma ybe one 
percent were tops, better than you could find an
yplace else. And -- and we knew some , this Mr. 
Ebart for instance, that we  used to do business w
ith. He wasn™t -- I know he wasn™t supposed to 
come  to buy us any mor e  in Koblenz, but he came anyway. 

Q: Mm. 

A: And maybe this -- this young man that sat ac
ross from us at  the Christmas party, I can™t 
believe that he didn't recognize us. And he ju
st didn™t say anything. That™s [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
56 
 
Q: Did -- did you get paid for this work that
 you did?  Wa s there anything that you got? 
A: No. 
Q: Or was --  

A: Oh no. 

Q: -- was the exchange that you were staying in
 this place and they were giving you some  food?  
Who were you working for when you -- when you were [indecipherable] 

A: Oh for -- for the Germans. 

Q: For the Germans.  

A: For the Germans.  

Q: I see. 

A: Get paid?  

Q: No, I didn™t -- 

A: Sure, sure.  
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And who else was working with you when you we
re filling those sacks 
with hay?  Were there 
other Jews who are working? 

A: The other guys that stayed in the -- 

Q: In that -- in the home. 

A: -- in that home , yeah.  

Q: And did you realize what these sack
s were for?  Did you have any idea? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
57 
 
A: Yeah. I think so. Yeah, I™m su -- I™m sure I did. 
Q: It was clear that they were going to deport Jews? 

A: Yeah, yeah. What it meant -- 

Q: You didn™t know. 

A: We  had no -- no idea. No idea. In the mean
ti me, my grandmother was still in Koblenz. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes, she never did get out. She wa -- she perished there in the camp. 

Q: And she must have been fairly old. 

A: Oh yeah, she was in her 80™s. 

Q: Do you think that your parents tried to get yo
ur grandma out as well?  
This is your mother -- 
your father™s mother? 

A: My -- no, no, my mot her™s mother. 

Q: Your mother™s mother.  
A: My mother™s mother.  
Q: You don™t know? 

A: Her -- she didn™t want to go. 

Q: She -- uh-huh. 

A: She didn™t want to go. 

Q: So what happened to 
your father™s parents? 

A: My father™s father died ear
ly,andmy m -- my grandmother di
ed -- I think she died in ™38 - 
™39, she died. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
58 
 
A: This -- one brother perished, this -- and his yo
ungest daughter did, in the camps. All in all, 
you know, the biggest share of our family got out, ex
cept for the kids from Koblenz, they all -- 
they all perished. 
Q: Right. 

A: My -- I had an uncle that got 
out early, he went to Israel, my 
Uncle Otto went to Israel, and 
his two brothers came -- came to this country
 and I think he got out in ™38 already. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: On my mother™s side, her -- my grandmother ha
d a brother in -- in [inde
cipherable]. They sent 
them to Auschwitz. He was in -- in a camp 
in France. I have Red Cross -- Red Cross 

correspondence my mother had, you know, I still 
have that. Uncle Yakov [indecipherable], yes, 
they perished both, in the camps. And -- but g-go
od share of my fa mily, we were -- we were 
lucky. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Tell me something a -- I™m trying to get a 
sense of the m -- the mood, if there was one, 
between you and Guy. It sounds like you™re ex
tremely practical. You don™t get depressed, you 
don™t get too positive, it™s just that you keep going. Is that -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: Is that how you are? 

A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. I -- 
someti mes I -- I™m still -- 
I -- I -- very -- I don™t 
know what it is, European. Can™t understand the ki
ds in this country. I mean, I™ve lived here 
most of my l i fe, you know, it™s just -- 

Q: What do you think the difference is? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
59 
 
A: Spoiled rotten. Spoiled to 
the p -- you know, they were just brought up wrong. I understand 
why. 
Q: Mm.  

A: I shouldn™t say this, but people have to be more 
self-reliant. It™s not -- 
it™s not like that with 
everybody, I know that, but there too ma ny that -- we
ll, they™ve lived at -- the different times --  
Q: Right. 

A: -- different times. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: Different times. We  knew we -- that is wasn
™t -- wasn™t going to be easy. We  expected the 
worst. We expected the worst and then --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- then if the worst 
didn™t happen, it was good. 
Q: It was good, yeah.  
A: That I didn™t get deported that 
time in Belgium, oh, it™s a mi racle. 
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah. What else can I tell you? 

Q: We ll, why don™t we take a break? 

A: Okay. 

Q: And change the tape. 

A: Yes.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Ernie, before I ask you about your trip out 
of Berlin, I thought of 
something a few mi nutes 
ago. What language we-were you speaking in Belgium?  
A: Flemish. 

Q: So did you -- 

A: Flumps, flumps. 

Q: Flumps?  

A: Flumps. 

Q: Did you know Fle mish before you came?  

A: No, no, nobody -- when we left there we spoke it as -- perfect. 

Q: Really? 

A: Both of us, yes. It™s not that much different
 from Ger man, but the pron
unciation of it, it™s got 
to be -- if you don™t want to be de
tected, it™s go to be just so. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I -- I think both of us had that, yeah. It wa
s so much e a sier for Guy, I think, than -- but he 
-- 

Q: Because he was that much younger? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Hm. Oka y, so -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
61 
 
A: But that time when we -- when we came to 
-- to the United States, when we came to New 
York, Guy couldn™t speak to his 
parents, all he knew was Flemish, he for got his German 
altogether. 
Q: Oh, you™re kidding. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you hadn™t forgotten German? 

A: No, no. Yeah. 

Q: So that must have been really upsetting. 

A: Oh yeah, yeah. We ll, I wouldn™t 
say he completely forgot  it --   
Q: Right. 

A: -- but it was hard for him.  

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Hm. All right, now you have your papers and 
you™re going to l -- now leave Berlin, and 
you™re heading for Spain, I gather, right? 
A: Right. They put us on this train, this one car, 
we  were only with -- was four refugees, but all 

older people. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They were all older people, and as far as I 
know we were the only kids, yes. I know we were 
the only kids on the train. There were no other ki
ds on the train. I reme mber they pulled the 
shades down at the station so nobody could look i
n. Maybe they did it because so we couldn™t 
look out, I don™t know.  

Q: And you had tickets? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
62 
 
A: I -- 
Q: You don™t reme mber. 

A: I don™t reme mber that. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Don™t reme mber anything about tickets, but 
we  -- we were on that train for a long time . 
Q: Did these adults, were they -- did they pay at
tention to you, did they talk with you, or were 
the two of you isolated? 

A: Well, we -- I™m -- I™m sure we talked. I don™t 
really reme mber this, but I™m sure we were -- 
we all talked. We  were all -- whatever it was, as
 it were -- we were all 
afraid. We all -- there 
wasn™t that much talking going on. We all knew 
it was our last chance, because we -- we knew 
the -- the deportations had started, a
nd we were very much afraid.  
Q: Did you think the Germans would go back on th
ese visas, on these pe
rmissions? You didn™t -- 
you had no idea. 
A: We  had no idea what -- what to ex
pect. We  we re anxious to leave. 
Q: Right. 
A: And couldn™t wait until we would get to Spai
n. Don™t reme mber how 
long it took, the -- these 
trains didn™t go very fa
st at that time . Took quite awhile 
until we got to -- through France, until 
we got to the -- to the Spanish border. 

Q: Did you have food with you, did you take 
food with you?  Some  bread, some  cheese, 
anything? 

A: Don™t reme mber. We must have. 

Q: You mu s t  have -- 

A: We must have. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
63 
 
Q: -- cause they didn™t feed you on the train. 
A: They didn™t feed us, no, no. 

Q: And again, you have no money. You have nothing.  

A: No, no, we had no money. 

Q: Nothing. 

A: No, no. Our papers, that™s it. No money, no. We 
got to -- to the Spanish border and we had to 
get off the train and get our -- ou
r baggage. I know there were German soldiers there that went 
through our baggage, through our papers. And we ha
d to leave this -- the 
train and get on -- it 
seemed like we -- it seems like there was a -- a speci
al car for us there, just the car, not -- not -- 

not th -- a complete train, and now that I start 
talking about it, I reme mber
 these anxious feelings 
to get out of German occ upied country, into -- an
xious to get to Spain. A
nd it -- after they tif -- 
they load us onto this car, they
 -- they backed us in -- in -- 
on-onto another -- on -- on another 

railroad track so that we coul
d get hooked onto the Spanish train. It seemed to take forever til 
they finally hooked us on, and it was just a little 
ways into -- into Spain. And we were so 
relieved, you know, I mean, that -- wh-when we 
got to San Sebastian 
that [indecipherable] 
Q: So all th -- all the people go all 
th -- everybody was goi
ng with this train. 
A: Everybody was on this -- this car. 

Q: Now, it -- when you switch the trains, is this
 the time when your brother ripped off his -- 
A: No, no -- 

Q: -- yellow star and hid it? 

A: He had -- this is bef -- before we got to the 
border, he had this -- we di
dn™t -- we didn™t wear 
the Jewish star any more. 

Q: Uh-huh, you tol -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
64 
 
A: In fact, we were not all -- nobody was supposed to have one. 
Q: I see. 

A: No. I don™t think we had to choo -- we wore a Je
wish star when we got 
on the train in Berlin. 
Q: You didn™t have one? 

A: No. I think we were told to take it off, and 
-- and Guy, my brother, pack
ed it into his suitcase, 
and he wasn™t supposed to. I guess the Germ
ans didn™t want anybody to know about this. 
Q: Do you reme mber giving it to some body?  Yours? 

A: I don™t reme mber that -- 

Q: You don™t reme mber? 

A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t -- did you know that your brothe
r had packed this in his suitcase, or did you 
only find that out afterwards? 

A: I don™t reme mber. I don™t -- I don™t th
ink I would have allowed him to do it. 
Q: Yeah. Right. When did you find out th
at he had it?  In
 San Sebastian? 
A: Some time afterwards. 

Q: Afterward. 

A: Yes, sometime afterwards. 

Q: We re you angry at him?  Or was there no point?   

A: Di-Didn™t matter at -- 

Q: Didn™t -- right. 

A: -- that time, even though after we -- well it -- we
 stayed in a -- in a hote
l, in a very nice hotel 
in San Sebastian, and I reme mber 
we got rolls with real butter. 
Q: Really? That was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
65 
 
A: Yes. And I think we stayed there for a day. 
Q: And who put you up? Wa s this -- 

A: That™s all the -- 

Q: -- by your mother, or this organization -- 

A: -- no, no, that™s th -- th -- 
th -- I think it
™s the Joint. 
Q: I see. 

A: Joint, we called it the Joint -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Distribution Committee. I 
think they did all that. They
 did all that, paid for it. 
Q: And is that who took th
is whole group from Berlin? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: Mm. So you had a nice room? 

A: Ho, ha, ha, ha -- I thought -- 
Q: In compa r ison with the way you were living? 
A: -- I thought so, I™m -- I™m -- I™m s ure it was, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I™m sure it was, yeah. 

Q: And you still are carrying your lu
ggage, this heavy luggage, or not? 
A: Yes, we still -- we 
had our -- our suitcases -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- yeah, we both had our suitcases, yeah. 

Q: Did -- 

A: And it took -- it took forever to go fr
om San Sebastian to -- to Barcelona. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
66 
 
Q: Barcelona. By train? 
A: By -- by train, and the -- the bun -- the bandits
 came on the train with us, I reme mbe r , and -- 
and they -- the Spanish police were on the -- on the train. They wore these funny, black hats. I 

reme mber a -- a young -- a young guy getting out of the 
train that got into 
our car, and I didn™t 
know Spanish. Some how we ma de each -- h-he ma de
 us understand that he
 w -- that he™s hidi ng 
from the -- from the police, and the -- as they ca
me  through we ma de like he was one of us so he 
wouldn™t be bothered, yeah, so I reme mber that, yeah.  

Q: So now you became a protector of some body.  

A: Yeah, I -- yes. 

Q: Because you [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, as long as he was trying to get away fr
om the police, that -- we
 probably thought that it 
was a good thing for us to -- to help him.  

Q: Now, who paid for your trip, the train trip fr
om San Sebastian to Barcelona, is this the Joint 
again? 

A: I think so. 

Q: And are ma ny of you going to Barcelona?  Do -- 

A: Yes, that whole -- 

Q: -- a -- everybody has to go? 

A: -- that whole -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- trainl oad --  

Q: So you™re a troop? 

A: -- went through -- yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
67 
 
Q: About how ma ny people do you thi
nk that was, do you have any idea? 
A: How ma ny fit into a railroad car? I don™t know. 
Q: I don™t know. 

A: No. 

Q: Hundred? 

A: I know we -- we slept on the 
train, you know, everybody slept -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- on the train. 

Q: And you were in one car? 

A: One car. 

Q: The whole trip? 

A: The whole trip. Now, we transferred from this 
one car in -- in France, 
through this one car in -
- 
Q: In Spain. 
A: -- that went to -- we went to Spain 

Q: And so that -- 

A: And we -- when -- when we got to Barcelona, 
we -- we was -- we stayed in different hotels. 

Q: Mm. 

A: We  stayed -- ma ybe a half a dozen stayed in 
the place where we stayed. A half a dozen stayed 
in -- i-in -- in different hotels in --  in 
Barcelona. And it was all 
arranged by the Joint.

A: We ll, I know we -- we -- we got together wi
th two more kids, one 
or two more kids in 
Barcelona, because I reme mber going on sightseeing 
trips with them. I remember there was a -- 
up on the hill there was a cross, it™s still ther

should tell this in -- but why not? 
Q: Why not. 

A: In -- in -- in -- in Spain, in Barcelona, we 
had no money. What ma de me  think is we went on 
this excursion with th
ese kids, you know, we -- we bought ba
nanas to take along. We  had money 
-- because we had money. We  knew s o me  of the pe
ople that we re with us, and -- a-and -- and we 
wanted to visit them in the -- these ot her hotels 
on the [indecipherable] de
 Cataluna, that™s where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

this hotel [indecipherable] the Hote
l Laurette. And I sat in a chair lik
e this, I want to
 try that here, 
too, ma ybe it happen here. And for some  reason, 
you know, I -- I reached back here and I came 
up with a handful of change. I sai
d, that™s not bad, you know?  I went to
 all the chairs 
in the hotel, 
you know, and -- and it seemed like every once inawhile the -- people would -- it would fall out 
of their pockets, you know -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- in the -- and then -- and I had enough money to buy bana nas, because f -- Spain was a very 

poor country at that time, extremely poor. Food 
was very scarce, what we mostly ate was 
cabbage, that was our -- our ma in 
-- ma in -- how do you say that, staple? 
Q: Meal -- st aple, yeah. 

A: Yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: So you took an excursion, you bou -- you bought 
the bananas and went on this excursion. 
A: Right, you know, we st -- we were there fo
r si-six weeks, in -- in -- in Barcelona. 
Q: So what in heaven™s name  did you do for six weeks? 

A: Wa lked all over Barcelona, we walked. Wa iting for -- well, we mi ssed one boat. So me thing 

happened that -- I don™t reme mber wh
at, that we didn™t get onto th
is boat and then the -- I know 
there were -- this Joint Di stri bution co m -- Committ
ee did all that to get -- get us onto another 
boat. 

Q: Mm. 

A: Which finally left from -- from Lisbon. But 
I didn™t -- we didn™t know 
how long we will be in 
-- in -- in -- in Barcelona. And, guess there 
was nothing to do for us, we -- we -- 
Q: So how did you get an appointme nt with the 
American consulate?  Did you just keep trying? 
A: I know we got appointme nts, we had an appointme nt, we went there.

Q: He wasn™t very nice to you, was he? 
A: No, no, he wasn™t, no. And I™ll never forget, he 
-- we were asked to come  to see him and into 
his room. Yeah, I reme mber he had -- he put 
his feet up on the desk, you know, and -- and he 
didn™t believe us that we got out of Germa
ny, I don™t know why not. And he was -- he -- he 
refused to -- ou -- give us our visa, but we had a 
-- we had a f -- was it a letter or a photocopy of 
a letter from the State Department that my mothe r  
got, that to any consulate,
 if he would get that, 
that they should issue us a visa, 
and well he -- eventually he did. 
Q: What did he think you were doing? 

A: I have no idea. Like he -- he wa
s not very cooperative, he didn™t -- 

Q: Your brother -- 

A: -- he hated -- he hated 
to -- to give us a visa. 

Q: Your brother thinks he  was very an
ti-Semitic. Do you remember hi m that way?  
A: It™s all possible. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: It™s possible. I don™t 
-- don™t remember that.  
Q: So did you have to go back more than once for him to agree or did 
you just stay with him 
until he fi nally agreed?  

A: Well, we -- seems like we went ther e several times.  

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: We  finally did get it, you know
, we -- we did get it, and -- and one day they told us, you 
know, we -- we have to go to Lisbon, and they put us on a train to Lisbon. 

Q: So this is the Jo
int who is telling you? 

A: Yes, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
71 
 
Q: Because you mi ssed the last boat from Barcelona -- 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: -- you have to go and get the -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- the boat from Lisbon. 

A: Right. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Right. Yes.  

Q: So now are other people traveling with you ag
ain as part of this [indecipherable] group -- 
A: To Lisbon? 

Q: -- or are you alone? 

A: I don™t reme mber.  

Q: Mm. 
A: What I do reme mber is, that there were 
several Gestapo agents on the train with us. 
Q: Really? 
A: Like I told you, that you can spot these guys a 
mile away. All -- well, some thing else, being in 
-- in -- in Spain at that time, 
we were not that secure anyway
. There were a lot of German 
soldiers there that came -- that s -- on -- on -- 
on leave, the -- the Germans had -- they went to 
Spain because Franco wa s -- was allied with Hitler. 

Q: Right. 

A: And after we finally settled down in -- in Barc
elona, we -- we were il
l at ease seeing all -- 
quite a few German sol diers. We  didn™t expect it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
72 
 
Q: And how were the Spanish to you?  We re you 
-- were you able to pick up some  Spa nish so 
you could speak a litt
le bit, or no? 
A: Oho, very little. 

Q: Very little. 

A: Quatta, questa, and -- 

Q: Uh-huh. Right. 

A: And -- and -- and -- and -- and a fe w -- a few 
words. The Spanish, very little contact, a few 
people where we stayed in the pensionne. Don™t 
-- don™t really reme mber. We had -- we -- we-

we stayed mostly by ourselves and with -- with
 this -- with the group 
that we were with.  
Q: Did the Joint warn you about walking ar
ound and staying away fr
om Germans if you see 
them? German soldiers? 

A: No, no. 

Q: They didn™t warn you. 
A: No, no. In fact, I don™t reme mber  anybody in part
icular, how we were notified th -- where to 
go, where not to go, when our appointme nts were w
ith the -- with --with th
e authorities there, 
and -- 
Q: But some body must have, right? 

A: Oh, I™m sure -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- yes, yeah, some body did, 
yeah. Some body -- but I don™t -- 
Q: So you didn™t ma ke the appointme nt -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- with the counselor. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
73 
 
A: No. 
Q: They ma de it for you. 

A: They ma de it for us, yes. 

Q: It™s a little surprising to me  that no a
dult went with you. If they were ma king these 
appointme nts, why wouldn™t they 
go?  You™re -- 
you™re children. 
A: Maybe they -- 

Q: Doesn™t that surprise you? 

A: Maybe they did, I don -- I don™t
 reme mb e r  a n y  mo r e .  A l l  I  r e me mb
er is -- is talking to a -- to 
the people at the -- at the consulate there. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Nobody seemed to talk for us, or at least I don™t reme mber anybody talking for us.  

Q: We re you nervous going to see the American consulate? 

A: Yes, oh yes, we were alwa
ys. There was always tension. 
Q: Did you and Guy talk beforehand as to 
what you would say, and what you thought mi ght 

happen?  

A: Oh yeah, yeah, we always -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- well, we  -- we did most of that in Belgiu
m, but at -- during the German occupation, we -- 
we practiced at night what -- what -- what they
 would ask, what they -- 
the questions they could 
ask, and what would be an answer 
that -- that they could believe. 
Q: Right. 

A: So there was -- of course there wa s tension, bu
t see, the tensions went
 away after we were on 
the boat, and as a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

Q: In li -- in lisb -- 
A: -- and I™ll -- I™ll never forget looking back at
 the harbor and then

A: I don™t think so. 

Q: Did you smile, do you think? 

A: I am [indecipherable].

there, too.  

Q: What kind of a -- 
A: Boat?  Was the [indecipherable], a con -- th

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: There were no cabins. There were hammocks in 
the -- in the hold of the boat, but Guy and I, 
we slept on top -- on -- on deck all the time, yeah. 

Q: Did you have blankets? 

A: I don™t -- 

Q: Cause it must have been chilly. 

A: I don™t -- I don™t remember.

Q: So it mus t  have been pretty -- 

A: It was -- no, it wasn™t cold at
 all. [i ndecipherable] we had -- 
well, Portugal is -- is warm, and 
from there we headed south. We  -- we were not 
out of port very long, and I guess then we were 
always on -- on deck. A sub came up. Ca me  up, and went back down again. 

Q: Really? 
A: Yes. If it was a German sub, it wa -- wa -- I -- 
Q: You have no idea. 

A: I have -- I have no idea, yeah. But that™s when

now we -- we™ve got it ma de now.  

Q: Did you guys get along the whole time you were
 together, after you le

A: Well, m- maybe he didn™t make it 
di -- difficult for me , he was -- 
Q: Mm. 
A: -- good kid. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Didn™t always see eye to eye, but we
 knew -- he knew what it was all about.  
Q: Right. 

A: I reme mb er when, on -- when I became Bar Mitzvah in -- in -- i-in Antwerp. He came to my 

party we had in the afternoon, you know, and I know 
he kicked me  in the shin for some thing.

Q: Did you kick him back? 
A: I don™t --

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
77 
 
A: I™m -- I™m -- I™m -- I™m sure he did. 
Q: Yeah. He didn -- he didn™t express th
at to you, though. Or that you remember. 
A: I don™t reme mber that, but I™m -- when I think 
back, he saw things di
fferent than I did, too. 
We haven™t talked lately about these things, bu
t I reme mber when -- when we did talk about 
them. 

Q: Can you give examples, any examples
 of how you saw things differently? 
A: It™s -- I™m sorry, but I can™t
. Can™t put it into words. 
Q: Mm-hm, right. 

A: He -- five -- those five years ma ke a big difference. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, I mean [indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. I changed when I -- that this whole 
thing had change d me  too. I will -- and I know 
when I -- when we came to the United States, trau
ma that -- took me a long time to get over it. A 
long time. Probably 30 - 40 years. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yes. And that I™m still different than ever
ybody else. Yeah, th -- thos
e like -- those kind of 
experiences, esp-especially if
 they take several years, 
your outlook -- outlook changes. 
Q: How do you think it changed you?  What do 
you think you would have been?  Do you have 
any idea how? 

A: I don™t really know. 

Q: Did it ma ke you trust people le
ss, or trust the world less? 
A: I don™t know, I -- I d
on™t know, I di -- I do -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
78 
 
Q: But you feel it? 
A: I would -- yeah. You -- yes, even people to
 people, I -- you know, 
you don™t think about those 
things, but now that you asked me , you know -- it 
ma de a -- it -- it ma kes a different person out 
of you. Not everybody, I™m sure it doesn™
t do the same  thing to everybody.  
Q: Maybe it™s also your age. You were so young 
and unfor me d that it would change you more. 
A: Yeah, oh yeah, I™m -- I™m sure it had something 
to do with -- that  had so mething to do with it. 
Yeah. I wish I could -- can™t explain it.  

Q: Well, let me ask you something. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: There were a lot of different people who helped you, in spite of the fact that you were 

separated, you were kids, and vulnera
ble, there were people all along -- 
A: That helped. 

Q: -- that helped. 
A: Yes. 
Q: That mi ght ma ke you think that even in a dang
erous situation there is a world that can be like 

home  in some  ways, even though 
it was difficult circumstance. 
A: Oh yeah, I mean, I -- 

Q: Right?  

A: -- I -- I always feel 
that I was very lucky. 
Q: Mm-h m.

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, yeah. Different with -- Guy is different
 than I am, my brother. Altogether different. 
Don™t even -- don™t even look alike. H-He had 
-- always had blonde hair, and he was a -- was a 
more likeable guy than I am. He 
is more -- it always seemed to me that he was more outgoing 
than I am. Maybe that™s -- 

Q: Did you think that -- if you look back on 
your childhood, before you leave your parents in 

Antwerp, do you see that kind of a difference be
tween the two of you?  He was more outgoing, 
you were less outgoing? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no, no, no. I -- I think I ch -- I changed. I 
changed because I always had in -- in -- in 
Koblenz, lot of friends, lot of friends. And then af
ter I came here it was very hard for me to make 
friends. 
Q: But you were turned into an adult very fa
st, weren™t you, at the age of 13 and 14 you had to 
take care -- 
A: Yeah, had to -- had to, yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Had to, yeah. I wasn™t the only one, I™m suppos
ed to -- I suppose therewere a lot of -- lot of 
kids my age at that time  that -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that grew up in a hurry. Some  of them it aff
ected different -- di fferently than it affected me . 
Q: Did you think Guy was changed less than you were change d because he  was that much 

younger?  You don™t know.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

Drank, ate with them and they 
had -- they mi xed wine and water, that was our  drink. We  made a few dollars on the way over, 

Guy and I. 
Q: How?  
A: All the baggage was -- was dumped into the 
hold of -- different holds which -- within -- 
where we had our bunks, where we had our hammocks, and they knew where -- where they -- 

where they were. They were -- se emed to be all on 
a pile in there, and people would ask us for -- 

that -- that needed to get to thei r valises, to fi nd 
their valise and bring it to
 them so they can get 
their -- get at  -- get out whatever
 they needed, and they always 
paid us. So we had -- we had 
several dollars in our --

was Hyma n, his last name  was Hy
ma n. He called our name  and -- and we talked to him from the 
railing of the boat, and he was down at the -- 
standing down there. Don™t reme mber what we 
talked about. 
Q: But that must have been shocki
ng, that some one would say your name. 
A: Some body in [indecipherable] in -- in
 -- quite, quite. Oh sure, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Your mother must -- she probably would have
 made a great spy, or something, I me an, sh -- 
that she would have all these ways of getting in
formation to you and getting information back to 
herself, cause she doesn™t know that you™re
 on this boat, right,
 she just as -- 
A: She -- she did. She must have. They must have known that we were on the boat. 

Q: So the Joint must have told her. 

A: Oh yes, I™m sure, I™m sure. We  didn™t corr
espond, but they -- through the authorities, through 
the Joint, they knew because they
 we re there waiting for us -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- when the boat got to New York, yes. 
Q: This is an incredibly long trip. If it™s
 Bermuda, Santa Domingo, Havana, Cuba, Vera Cruz, 
Mexico and then back up. 

A: And then back up, yes. 

Q: It™s unbelievable. 

A: Yeah, yeah, it took six weeks we we
re on this -- on the [indecipherable]  
Q: Wa s it tough to be patient?  Cause this -- you™re 
finally going to get out 
of all of this and be 
with your parents. 

A: Oh we -- we were happy to be -- 

Q: On the ship. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
87 
 
A: On the ship, yes. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yes. Wa s a -- was an adventure for us, you know, too. 

Q: Now, you were in, was it San Domi ngo when 
Pearl Harbor was attacked?  December seventh -
- 

A: Yes, December seventh, yes, I reme mber that
, reme mber well. We were afraid maybe they 
wouldn™t let us come  to New York any more. We
 didn™t -- because the war broke out, we didn™t 
know how -- how the United States would -- would r
eact to it. Because I -- 
I reme mber the Saint 
Louis comi ng back to Antwerp, I was there. 

Q: Really? 

A: I s -- I saw the Saint 
Louis in Antwerp, yes. 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: Hm. How did that happen?  
How come  you were -- you heard a
bout the ship coming back, or 
what? 
A: How?  I don™t reme mber just how, but -- 

Q: But you actually saw the sh -- 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

Q: Did you meet people who disemb arked? 

A: I don™t -- don™t remember that.  

Q: Hm.  

A: Some times I doubt myself [indecipherable] sure

was that? That was in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
88 
 
Q: It was in 30 -- in ™39? 
A: Think so. I™m not -- 

Q: Or ™38?  Now I™ m not sure 
you we re in [indecipherable]  
A: Yeah. Now I™m not so sure
 any more, but that™s a -- 
Q: You think you saw it. 

A: Yeah. That™s a long time ago, you know, I 
-- I -- but it seems like I reme mber that.  
Q: So this guy who calls out to you in sant --
 San Domi ngo, he™s going to
 then let your parents 
know. Is he going to -- 

A: I™m sure that was the idea, yes. 

Q: [indecipherable] yeah. 

A: That he saw us on the boa
t, yes. I™m sure that -- 
Q: Now, do you reme mb er comi ng into New York harbor? 

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Did you see the St atue of Liberty? 
A: Yes. Wh at I know for sure [indecipherable]
 I reme mber looking down off the boat after we 
pulled into the -- in -- in -- in 
-- into port, and -- an -- up a -- 
up against the pier, I remember 
looking down to see my father and mother. 

Q: You do? 

A: Yes, and they called out to us, yes, we s -- yes.  

Q: What a journey. 

A: And -- yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. But what I also 
reme mb er is that it -- 
it felt like -- like -- 
like a dr eam. Couldn™t believe it when we -- after -- after we were -- got settled in and -- in -- in 

New York. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
89 
 
Q: Tell me what that first mo ment was -- 
A: That -- that -- that  -- that we we
re ac-actually -- that we were ac
tually there, that it wasn™t -- 
that it wasn™t  a dream.  

Q: What was it -- what was it like to greet 
your parents when you came off the ship? Wa s it -- 
A: I -- 

Q: Do you reme mber what it was like? 

A: I don™t reme mber the fee
lings, I reme mber they were there, and -- and -- 
Q: Did they look like what you thought they 
would look like?  Had they changed?  Do you 
r e me mb e r ?  

A: Don™t reme mber. 

Q: You mus t  have change d a lot for them, becau
se with kids a couple of years is a lot. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I reme mber wher
e they lived. I thought th
at -- that seemed like 
a palace to me  --  
Q: Right. 
A: -- because we were ready to live anyplace, you
 know. It didn™t matter where. I remember they 
had sublet it, sublet several -- a coup
le of rooms from other refugees -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- in Wa shington Heights. And -- you know
, I -- I thought it was great, we -- 
Q: You lived in Cabrini Boulevard? 

A: What? 

Q: Cabrini Green, was that -- no, Cabrini -- 

A: Cabrini bou -- Cabrini Boulevard, yes. Lived two or three floors up. I think their name  was 

Katz, right?  Mr. and Mrs. Katz. Bu
t then shortly after that we got
 our -- we went into our own

apartment. My f-father and mother both worked. My
 father at that time  worked for S. Klein on 
Union Square. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: My mother did housework, she -- 

Q: Wa s your father a salesman at S. 
Klein?  Is that wh
at he was doing? 
A: He stock -- stocked the clot
hes racks, you know, in the s -- in the stockroom. They hired 
mostly refugees, lot of refugees worked there. Then later on they -- he worked for another outfit, 

and he -- he had a higher position. But yes,
 then we started going to school. 
Q: Did you learn English quickly? 

A: Guy did, a lot faster than I did, you know. I 
was sent to -- to a Jewish camp, also through a 
Jewish organization that -- when we first camethat first summer, in Green County, I reme mber 

that, Green County, New York. And 
I was made counselor over the li
ttle kids, and they taught -- 
when I came  home from camp, my Englis
h was pretty good. They taught me , yes. 
Q: How did you find your parents?  Di d you find 
them change d, did you feel yourself very 
comfortable with them, as if time had not
 lapsed?  Do you reca
ll how that was?   
A: I don™t re -- I -- I know I felt strange. 

Q: You did. 

A: I felt strange, yes. Everything was different 
for me , nothing seemed, you know, natural. It was 
like in a -- well, like in a dream, you 
know, like things weren™t real. But -- 
Q: Let me  a sk you this. For -- for two years -- I guess it™s almost two years, you are, in a way,

Q: Now you come  back -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
91 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- and your parents are there. And in a 
way -- my suspicion is they take away -- 
A: Should be ma k -- ma de it easier for me
. Should have made it easier for me. 
Q: But in some ways it made it harder because
 it took away a certain responsibility and -- 
A: I don™t -- I don™t -- I don™t know 
just what -- the experience
 had cha -- had changed me . 
Q: Right, right. 

A: I -- I was very happy to be a --
 to -- to get out of Europe -- 
Q: Of course. 

A: -- get out of. And I was happy to be here. 

Q: Did your parent --  

A: That™s a -- 

Q: -- g -- I™m sorry. Did your parents ask you ab
out what happened during those years when you 
were apart?  Did you sit down and talk? 
A: Oh, I-I -- I told them -- 
Q: What had happened. 

A: -- I told them -- told them everything, of course. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: Yeah, sure. But we survived it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I mean, that was the -- we -- af
ter that, everything was -- was easy.  
Q: When did you find out all that your mother 
had done?  When did you realize -- fully realize 
how much -- 

A: After -- after we came to the -- aft-after we came here -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
92 
 
Q: Ca me  here. 
A: -- you know, and we -- we saw, and we saw all 
that -- see all the lett
ers that she wrote -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and the -- all the co
rrespondence and -- oh yeah. That™s when we found out. 
Q: Were you amazed? 

A: Oh yeah. Oh yes, yes. That sh
e was able to -- to do all that.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: That she was able to come  to Wa shington, an
d -- and go and see a senator. We  had no means, 
and I™m sure when she got off the train in Wa sh
ington, and wherever she st
ayed, that -- that she 

walked wherever. So -- but 
we did what had to be done. 
Q: Did -- did your father go with her to Wa shington, or was -- 

A: No, no -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- no, no, no. I™m sure he went 
to work, he worked, he had job. 
Q: Did you find him better now, that ma ny years after Dachau? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Had he become  more  like the person you knew? 

A: Oh yeah. Sh -- oh, sure, yes, yes, yes. He -- he
 got -- he c -- he came -- 
his first job was as a -- 
as a dishwasher, then he got a j
ob as a painter. I think he ma de 
eight dollars a week, and then he 
went to work Union Square, and -- and then he go
t -- went to work for a
nother outfit, their name  
was S. Klein also, but they had seve
ral stores in town -- 
in -- in -- in -- in 
-- in this country. New 
York, and I don™t -- I reme mber him going to a s -- 
some place in Ohio, opened up a new store, or 
closed one down, some thing like that. And that wa
s up to my mother to do
 all that, her English 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
93 
 
was so muc h better than my -- my dad, even tho
ugh my -- I reme mber my dad™s, his English was 
very good. 
Q: Hi-His English was good? 

A: Oh yes. Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Had he learned it also? 

A: No, no -- 

Q: But he learned it when he came. 

A: -- no, no. He learned after he -- yeah, came to
 this country, yeah. You know, while -- while I 
was -- while we were still in Germany, there wa
s a -- there was some body th
at -- that we knew, 
that taught me, that I -- I was sent
 to her to learn English, he ta
ught me  some  -- very little, not 
very much. But I reme mber going th
ere, and she would try to -- tr
y to teach me  English. And I -- 
I knew a little bit when I came to this country, yes. Ask me . 

Q: Did you -- did you like New York? 
A: Did I like New York? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Y-Yes, yes, yes. Wa s  not a bad place to live at 
all. I -- I had -- at firs
t when I went to school 
[indecipherable] I finished high schoo
l in New York. Wa s hard for me .  
Q: Mm. 

A: It didn™t have extra classroom
s for -- for refugees that  -- that were help -- that  were helped 
because they couldn™t speak the language. You e
ither -- you either passed the -- pa ssed the 
course or you didn™t. So at 
-- at first it was -- it was har
d, but it was a good place to live. 
Q: And you were living amongst a lot of
 Ger man Jewish refugees there. 
A: They were all -- all -- all refugees, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
94 
 
Q: Right. 
A: All refugees.  

Q: So that must have ma de it more -- were

A: Oh yes, oh yes, I -- I joined the -- the Maccabee, the -- 

Q: Uh-huh.

 German Jewish kids, yeah, mo
st of them. And I did befriend 
several. Wa s hington Heights, the refugees used to
 sit on the park, at -- on
 Fort [indecipherable] 
Park until midnight. Nobody bothered them. 

Q: Right. 

A: It™s different today. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: But we were happy, happy to be there, until 
we  got the urge to get out of New York. 
Q: Right. Let™s stop the tape now so we 
can change it, and we™ll do one more -- 
End of Tape Three

where you came  from, what happened to you, or was it nobody was asking? 
A: Nobody. 

Q: Nobody? 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: So even when you became friends with people, that wasn™t part of the -- 

A: My friends, I told them, you know, if they want

told them, but nobody seemed to be -- 

Q: Very interested. 

A: -- interested in it. 

Q: Right. 

A: Oh, although, I re -- I reme mber we first came to
 this country, at first th
ere were -- we went to 
see several people. I remember my mother taking 
us, and they were very interested, yeah, and -- 
course I -- at that time I reme mbered everythi

 write a book about it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Then -- then everybody, you know, you me t -- they

job, went in the service. 

Q: I was going to a -- let me

96 
 
Q: And then -- then what should -- did she do? 
A: That™s it.

A: That™s what she di d until we left  New York. She -- 

Q: Wa s that hard on her?  

A: I don™t know if it was hard

A: We  had no -- you know, never -- didn™t mut -- ma ke much money. 
Q: Right. 

A: We  had a -- we lived in walk-up apartments, 
we d -- and I reme mber when -- when we moved 
from Cabrini Boulevard to further uptown, my 
-- they were very fussy what apartment they 
would take. Couldn™t spend much
 money. I think our -- I think 
was 45 dollars a week, I think 
they went -- 45 dollars a month, the rent wa
s. Lived in a very nice neighborhood on Thayer 
Street, that was one block before
 200 -- before Dikema n Street. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And it wasn™t -- you know, nothing 
fancy, but that™s when I -- let me  see, was I -- yeah, I was 
-- was I still going to school?  No, that™s when -- 
no, that was -- I was out of [indecipherable] I

97 
 
was -- that ™s after I came  home from the servi

Street. 
Q: So your -- your parents, unt
il 1946, stayed in Cabrini Boul
evard, or you moved mo re than 
once?  

A: Hm. No, we moved before I went in the service. 

Q: Mm. 

A: We  din -- before I went in the service we 
moved from Cabrini Boulevard to Thayer Street. 
Q: Now Ernie, you were here for two year
s and then you™re drafted, or did you -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So -- 

A: Yeah, so what? 

Q: Did you want to go? 

A: Oh, sure. 
Q: Oh su -- just -- 
A: Sure. Yeah. 

Q: You didn™t feel like y
ou had been through enough? 
A: Well, but there was a war on, and -- and th
ere wa -- we had -- nobody had any qualms about -
-  

Q: About going. 

A: -- that -- about going,
 oh yes. Yeah, sure.  
Q: Wa s there any suspicion about you because 
you were from Ger many, when you got in the 
army? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
98 
 
A: Yes. We ll, the suspicion was long before th
at, th -- we were looked upon as a -- by -- by 
Americans as -- as Germans, you know, as Germa n
s, they cou -- they didn™t know the difference 
between a -- a German J e w, and a -- and a Germa n
 that wasn™t Jewish, you know, they -- lot of 
people just -- just was beyond them, you know?  I can™t
 follow tha -- I -- up unti -- til today I 
don™t understand why -- I can unde
rstand why the general popul
ation wouldn™t know, but the 
governme nt either wa -- wer -- weren™t any smarter, or
 were they -- or didn™t
 want to be smarter?  
I don™t -- 
Q: So how -- wh-what did the governme nt do, 
did the governme nt -- were they spying? 
A: Well, the -- well, yeah, they -- they we had to 
get either -- I had to ge
t special permission to -- 
to -- I wanted to go see my uncle in -- in -- in 
-- in Connecticut, we had to get special permission 
to -- to go there, you know. Everybody, they s -- 
kept track of us pretty good, even though I 

thought it was unnecessary, we -- we  certainly
 weren't going to hel -- be -- y-you know, do 
some thing, you know, against the -- agai
nst -- against the United States. 
Q: So they couldn™t ma ke a distinction betw
een German Jews and Nazis?  [i ndecipherable] 
A: Apparently. 

Q: Apparently not.  

A: Yeah. Th -- I -- I can understand that from the 
general population that ma
ybe they were just -- 
just didn™t know, but the governme
nt, I -- I -- I think there were 
-- well, there wa
s a lot of anti-
Se mitism in the State Departme nt, 
so I -- I -- I was told, you know. 
Q: Do you -- do you know whether your parents were
 shadowed, if people were suspicious and 
the governme nt was ma king sure they we
ren™t seeing the wrong people, or -- 
A: I -- I don™t know. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
99 
 
A: I -- I d -- I don™t know. I couldn™t 
-- can™t think of anything specific. 
Q: So were all -- when you all wanted to
 visit your relative
 in Connecticut -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- everybody in the family, all fourof you had to get special permission? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And whe r e was that -- where did you have to go to get special permission, do you know?  

Cause your mother must -- mother 
and father mu st have done that. 
A: Well, I -- I™ve st ill got the -- the thing -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- where we had the -- some  federal authorit
y, I don™t reme mber any more. But that -- that™s 
how it was then.  

Q: Do you reme mber your parent™s and your brother™s
 response to your being drafted?  We re they 
upset, or did they just think it™s -- 
A: Oh, not at -- 
Q: -- this was great -- 

A: -- not at all. 

Q: -- you™re going to go and -- 

A: I don™t know if they thought 
it was great, you know, but that was-- that was war and we were 
fighting the war and that was certainly my place to be there. 

Q: Right. 

A: I had no qualms about that. Went to
 -- I wanted to be in the navy.  
Q: That™s [indecipherable] to be a sailor. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
100 
 
A: They ask me  -- they a -- a -- they a -- as
k me , this was the induc
tion, the [indecipherable] 
induction is, what branch of the service would 
you like to be in, I sa
id, navy. They says -- I 
reme mber [i ndecipherable] army. They said how
 come  you know, I says, ha, we saw you ma rch 
up through here, you know, you could ma rch so
 good. Just kidding around. That day everybody 
went in the army, I guess. 

Q: So wa -- was there a dra 
-- were you drafted, or did you -- 
A: Yes, yes -- 

Q: -- you were -- you were drafted 

A: -- I was drafted, yes. But, you know, as soon as you 18. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yes, soon as I turned 18. 

Q: Was it -- automatic. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: So what was basic training 
like for you?  How ma ny wee ks?   
A: Well, they send me to -- what the -- my inducti
on was in -- in Fort Dix, New Jersey, and from 
there I went to C-Camp Hood in Texas. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And basic training wa s -- so ma ny things that
 I forget. Basic training at first was tough and 
then it was easy, but there were a 
lot of German pr
isoners there.  
Q: In -- in -- 

A: In -- in Camp Hood. 

Q: -- Camp Hood? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
101 
 
A: Ca mp Hood, yeah, they brought them from -- fro
m North Africa, with th
e North Africa corps, 
and they were still think -- they
 -- they -- they still thought they
 were going to win the war. I 
talked to some  of the m. They 
were still gung-ho, they were laughi
ng at us for -- they were laying 
in the sun with shorts on, and they watched us 
ma rch to go bivouac, and we ha -- they never had 
it so good when they -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- as PW™s here.  

Q: That mus t  have infuriated you.  

A: We ll, I wasn™t happy about it, but
 I was happy that they -- there 
were PW™s at least, but they 
were st-still thought they were 
going to win. And then the basic 
training was cut short because 
they needed us over there. Wa s supposed to 
be, I don™t know, 17 -- 13 weeks of basic training, 
was cut short several weeks. 

Q: Mm. 
A: We  were supposed to get a seven day delay en
 route before we got shipped overseas and that 
was cut short. And I was foolish enough that they 
told us, take a troop trai
n, don™t take a civilian 
train, take a troop train because they got
 preference, you going to get there -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- get -- get to New York faster. Well, I reme
mber we -- we were stopped and we saw all the 
civilian trains, they just flew by us. And some  
of the -- some  of the guys got off and got on -- on 

civilian trains. But I believed them, you know? 

Q: So were you late for wherever you were suppo -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
102 
 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, out of the seven days it
 was four days, some thing like that, and then -- 
yeah, they -- we were not too far from the -- from
 there we had to report
 in Baltimore, it seems 
like, Kilmer? Wa -- is that 
in [indecipherable] some place. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Then they took us to New York, and I 
took the Queen Mary ove
rseas, 10,000 me n on it. 
Q: Really? 

A: [indecipherable]. Oh, by the way, I became a citi
zen down in -- in -- for
got about that, in -- 
Q: Ca mp Hood? 

A: -- in Camp Hood, yes. In Bell County, Texa
s. [indecipherable] gotta be a citizen -- 
Q: Oh, that™s right, you have to be
 a citizen in order to be -- 
A: That™s what I thought. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But there were guys that came back from the Al
eutian Islands at that time , they came back as 
soldiers, and they became citizens with me. 
Q: Afterwards, really? 

A: Yeah. So they had sent some  of t h
em overseas before that already, yeah. 

Q: So what were you being trained in this -- 

A: Infantry. 

Q: Infantry.  

A: Infantry, yeah.

but then they -- they caught me  twice and they 
send me  back. And I parked it -- I st
ill got the address, I parked it 
in Acha with a five gallon can 
of gas in it. But that was on my way, I had to
 leave for an -- for Antwerp, but I went through 
Koblenz -- went through Koblenz, you know -- 
Q: Mm. 

A: -- through -- Koblenz was in the -- in the Fren
ch sec -- sector, and I don™t -- I don™t know, I -- 
you know, nobody wore in-insignias, or -- you coul
dn™t tell a -- sure, a general you probably 
could have, but you couldn™t tell a 
captain from -- from anybody else. We ll, of course this was 
after the war already again, so th
ey did wear -- anyway, I had a ma
 -- a major™s cap on. Twen -- I 
was all of 19 -- 20 -- 

Q: Right. 

A: But got away with it. Didn™t shave for a few da

Q: And you saw your house? 
A: Yes. That wasn™t -- well, it was

was at the hou -- our house. One, the front 
wall was good, everything else
 was flattened. That 
whole town was -- 
Q: Was -- was completely fl attened. 

A: Wa s pretty well flat, yes. I went to see Hil

was a horse butcher, and he had a

where he lived, you know. I went 
to see hi m. There was nothing standi ng there, an
d he invited me  into his kitchen, there was no 
roof to his kitchen, you know. He -- he had bought 
our house before my parents left Ge rmany, he 
bought the house with the -- that 
my -- m- my grandmother was supposed to -- she kept her -- her 
-- the first floor was hers until she would die a natural deat h, of course. And I heard fr om Mrs. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
112 
 
Teale, that™s the lady that I stud
ied the history of Jews in Kobl
enz now, what -- that she had to 
leave there, even though the man, hillas -- hillas 
-- this Mr. Hillas Hyam fought tooth and nail, 
she said, you know, that she should stay. They
 wouldn™t let her sta
y. They brought all the 
rema ining Jews together in one -- one place. But 
anyway, I -- I saw him, and then I tried to -- I 
asked, you know, are there any Jews left, and he to
ld me about a -- a Mr. Pollak that had married 
a non-Jew, that survive -- that they never caught.
 I went to see him. I ha -- just had a short 
conversation with him, don™t reme mber what --
 all I can ima -- I would imagine I must have 
asked what happened to everybody? 
Q: Right. Di -- had you known this pe
rson before, or was he a stranger? 
A: I -- I -- no, I didn't know hi m, I heard the name. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Heard the name, but I -- I -- 
I didn™t know him. I didn™t see 
anybody else in Koblenz. That 
was shortly after the -- after the war -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- ended. 

Q: So you were discharged in ™46? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And then you go back to your parent™s house? 

A: Went back home, yes. 

Q: So you™re now 20? 

A: Right. 

Q: And Guy is 15? 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
113 
 
Q: Guy is sort of the age you were when you first became -- 
A: Right, yeah, right, yeah, yeah -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- yeah, yeah. Yeah, I -- I [indecipherable] when 
I went to sc -- when I went to school, first I 
went to George Wa shington high school, which wa
s an academic school, and did a -- I wanted to 
learn a trade, and everybody thought
 it was a good idea. I went to ma chine and me tal trade high 
school. I had a job after school, worked for Atla
s Recording Machines, very all -- well known 
[indecipherable]. Mr. Kutner, a -- a Ge rman and a 
Syrian owned that place. Mr. Kutner, not -- he 
was not Jewish, not Jewish. He was a teacher at 
-- in -- in Berlin at the -- so me technical 
institute. Very smart guy, and I went back there af
ter the war, after I came home from - -  from -- 

fr om the service, I went  to work with them ag
ain, and I -- I was -- I liked it, and I wa -- I was 
probably pretty -- I was good at it. And there were
 several guys there, this
 -- this old guy, he was 
in his 40™s, he asked me  to go into business with him, and -- 
Q: This old guy in his 40™s? 
A: This old guy in his for -- in hi
s 40™s. I didn™t -- by 
that time my father was not well any more, 
he had heart problems. Wanted to get out of th
e city the worst way, you know, and he wanted to 
do the same  thing my uncles in Connecticut did, 
he wanted to be a farmer, a cattle dealer. And 
that™s -- he eventually, you know, bought a farm
 in upstate Ne w York. First we looked in 
Pennsylvania, couldn™t afford it. At that time  a 
lot of Ger man Jewish refugees bought farms in -- 
in Vineland. 

Q: Right. 

A: Chicken far ms. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
114 
 
A: So by war™s end the -- the val -- the land valu
e was already more than 
w-we could afford. We  
had -- we had saved 5,000 dolla
rs. That™s a lot of money. 
Q: That™s a lot of money. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And then we started to look in Pennsylvania, 
then we moved to -- further, further and further 
up. We  finally wound up in -- in Norwich. I got a G.I. loan. 

Q: Did your mother want to move also? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: She did? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah. 

Q: So everybody did. 

A: Oh yes, yes, yes. Yes, and I -- 
Q: But you didn™t get into 
cattle trading, you did some th
ing else in farming? 
A: Yes, I d -- I -- I -- I -- I dealt in cows. 
Q: But, for milk? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: We ll, yes, yes, I did -- we did both, we did both. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We -- we -- we bought the farm. I -- I was the farmer, because from -- from New York, 

knowing that we were gonna buy a farm, I got a j
ob on a farm in Monticello from Max Yasgur, 
and he taught me  well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
115 
 
Q: How did you get that job? 
A: Through the Jewish agricultural society. They got
 in touch with Yasgur, apparently they knew 
him, you know, and he -- he hired me. I worked for 
him for three-quarters of a year and we were 
interested in several farms and he a s ked me  to 
stay with him, he wanted me  to go in business 
with him. I -- I worked hard, I wa -- I 
was young, and -- and I wasn't  afraid to work. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I took to the work good, but we wanted to have our own far m. 

Q: Have your own, right. 

A: Yeah. And we saw several places that we were
 interested in, we fina
lly bought the place in -- 
in Norwich. 

Q: Norwich. 

A: It wasn™t just what we want
ed. We ™ll s -- I always said, well, 
we™ll stay here for three, four 
years, and then I™ll buy a real
 farm. That™s 54 years ago.  
Q: We ll, what™s the difference between Norwich and a real farm?  

A: And a real farm? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, Norwich is -- is a li
ttle hilly. There™s in a -- N-No
rwich itself is in a valley. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we have valley land and we have some  h
ill land. I wanted one that wa
s all in the valley -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- because when I worked for Max Yasgur, that 
was -- in Monticello, that
™s all in the hills and 
-- and I knew that wasn™t the -- that
 wasn™t a way to farm it. But we -- the fi rst year we -- we just  
milked cows the first year. And then my f -- 
my father, of course, knew -- I didn™t know the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
116 
 
cattle business. I knew -- by that time I knew how 
to work the land, how to milk a cow, how to 
raise crops, but after the first year my  father 
started dealing in cows. 
One of the reasons we 
bought the fa rm in -- in -- in -- in Norwich is because it had a small Jewish community. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And there were several Jewish cattle de
alers there that my father knew from -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- from -- from Ger many. 

Q: Right. 

A: And so we started dealing in cows, my brothe
r and I. I -- I ran the farm, my brother helped. 
He was still in high school, but 
you know, he -- it -- it™s from 
4:30 in the morning until -- until 
you™re done. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: Which might be nine 
o™clock, 10 o™clock, whatever time it is, you know. 
Q: It™s tough work, isn™t it? 

A: Yes. And then he, at 6:30 he would go up an
d take a shower and get ready for school -- for 
the school bus. And then after he graduated sc
hool, he -- he was on th
e farm. We would go on 
the road every day, buy cows, sell 
them f -- ma ke -- an-a
nd milk cows. We started -- there were 
20 -- 23 head on the farm, 23 head. I think eight
 -- 18 milkers and -- and five head of young 
stock, yeah. Within -- and -- and he
 didn™t cut a -- this guy that ha
d the farm, Donald Davis, he 
didn™t cut enough hay -- didn™t cut en
ough hay for what he had. Within three or four years, we 
had 40 - 50 head, and then -- and we had more hay 
than -- than we needed, we sold hay. And -- 
but too bad my dad didn™t 
last long. He died in fift -- he bought
 the farm in ™48, and he died in 
™52. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
117 
 
Q: Really.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s too bad. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your mother lived with you -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- through th
e whole period? 
A: Yes, yes.  

Q: And you -- you me t your wife in what
 -- you got ma rried in ™56 -- no, ™59. 
A: ™59, yes. 

Q: Right. And she™s from Norwich? 

A: No, no. 

Q: No?  Whe r e™d you meet her? 
A: A city girl. 
Q: Davina?  

A: Davina is a city girl. 

Q: What, New York city girl? 

A: Oh yeah, yes, from the Bronx. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Bronx. She had an uncle in -- that worked 
for the Norwich pharmaceutical company in -- in 
Norwich, and she was visiting -- and he was a fr
iend of my br other™s, Abe Middlemark, yes, 
Abe. And I -- I met her, and came to see a couple
 of times in New York, and got engaged, and -- 
Q: After a couple of times?  So fast? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
118 
 
A: After -- well, I don™t know, after -- no, more. Probably -- 
Q: Three or four times, ma ybe?  

A: Six. 

Q: Six. 

A: Better -- better than six months, you know the -- 
but of course, I couldn™t come  to New York 
that often. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah, within a year we -- I think a year late
r we got ma rried, yes. A
nd it™s quite a change for 
a city gi rl -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and I wasn™t --  I was ill -- ill at ease. 

Q: About whether she would adjust to this? 

A: That she would -- right, oh yes. And was quite
 a change for her. But I couldn™t marry al -- I 
had to ma rry the Jewish girl. Ther
e was just no two ways about that. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you lived on this fa rm for over 50 years, you still have the farm?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: But it™s now a driving range? Part of the farm? 

A: Well, I -- I sold the cows, yeah, sold the cows. 
Well, my brother left in -- my brother left the 
far m in ™69 -- ™68 -- ™69. He a -- he had back problems. 

Q: Mm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
119 
 
A: And he went to live in New Jersey, and I 
stayed on and I milked cows, dealt in cows, both, 
and raised a fa mily. 
Q: Right. How ma ny children? 

A: Three boys and a girl. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they decided not to follo
w in my footsteps, even though 
they -- they helped while they 
were going to school. They know all about farmi
ng, and all about cows. In fact my -- one of 
them wanted to become  a veterinarian, my -- my 
Joe, but [indecipherable] 
he™s not -- he™s not 
going to st-stick around school that
 long, he™ll never do it. He w
ould have ma de a -- you know 
there are veterinaries and th
ere are veterinarians. This 
guy can look through an animal. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, he can look through an animal. But it didn™t 
-- he -- he di -- he -- he get sa -- he™s doing 
some thing else, yeah. My oldest one, he liked 
farming. They -- they all like -- they all like 
far ming, they just don™t want 
to ma ke a living that way. 
Q: Right. 
A: Because it™s -- it™s -- it™s 
too ha rd, there™s no money in it. Ha
rd to raise a family, but my --  
Q: Is it ha rd to raise a family, why? 
Because you s -- have to [indecipherable] 

A: Be-Be-Because you don™t have -- you -- you -- you 
ki -- don™t have the means to do what -- 
what the city kids do. 

Q: I see. 

A: I mean, you know, with TV today, they -- th
ey know how -- how easy it is f-for some  people 
to make a living.  

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
120 
 
A: And they all like for --  they 
like to be gentlema n far mers.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: They like to have farms, and -- and -- and 
-- and land and -- and animals, and have some body 
else do the work.  

Q: Else to the work, yes. 

A: And they mi ght get that chance yet. 

Q: But you™re glad you did this? 

A: I have no regrets, no, no, no. I could have ve
ry well -- I mi ght have done some thing else -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but as it turned out, I raised a great family. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And Norwich was a nice place to live. The farm has still got me. 

Q: Right. 
A: They ask me if I™m still on the farm, and I always tell them, the farm has got me. 
Q: With a -- with a 200 year old house, huh? 

A: [indecipherable] 200 year old house, yes, and 
new roads. When I moved there it wa s a dirt 
road, then in 1951 or two, they bl
acktopped it, and then they ma de 
it a little bit bigger a couple of 
times and they just finished it now, I got a superhighway now out there. 

Q: Oh, wow. 

A: Which I don™t like. Di dn™t need it. But the 
government™s got so much money they got to 
spend it someplace. 

Q: I know when we talked throughout the last 
few hours, you said you really don™t know how 
this experience in Europe changed you. Do you -- do you ever feel surprised when you think

back on what you did, you and your 
brother, that you were able to
 ma neuver through all of this, 
or that™s not how you think? 
A: Makes me think like -- like 
not -- I™m not very religious, you know, I -- I™m very Jewish. I 
would say that™s my -- that™s my politics. God 
takes care of his fools, ma ybe. We  were lucky 

some body -- some thing, you know, when you realize what
 happened to all the rest over there, 
and -- and that we were so vulnerable. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- and -- and still we -- we got out, so
 I™m -- I got a lot to be thankful for. 
Q: Right. Your mother was a kind of guardia
n an -- this amazing guardian angel, some how. 
A: She -- 

Q: Extraordinary. 

A: -- she -- oh yes, she did -- if anybody else I™d 
-- I™m -- we would not -- 
I don™t know if we 
would have survived it, but I know we wouldn™t ha
ve gotten to the United States when we did.  
Q: Right. 

A: I know that. So, between -- between her and God -- 

Q: And a fe w nice people who [indecipherable] 

A: -- and that -- and the -- yeah -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and -- and -- and --  

Q: And you. 

A: People [indecipherable] people -- 

Q: Re me mb er, you and your -- you and your 
brother are part of this, too.

A: We ll, we -- we -- we -- we did save our skin. But it™s a great country anyway, the United 
States. 

Q: You think so, yeah. 

A: Oh yeah, great country. Nobody complains more
 than I do, but a great country, yes, yeah. 
Q: Let me a sk you a mo re contemporary 
question. Some body who™s been through the 
experiences you were during the war, when you think 
about what™s happened 
here in the last six 
weeks, what happened on September 11
th
, do you feel different than other Americans who never 
experienced anything? 

A: I -- you know, I -- I -- I 
thought I did. I thought I™d -- 
that I feel differently. 
Q: Mm. 

A: But I listened to a couple of congressman the 
other day, I-I watch C-Span a lot, he feels just 
like I do. I think we ma ke -- we ma ke so ma ny mi st
akes that I -- I say to
 my -- all -- all this 
didn™t ever happen -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: -- if they would have ju
st done it right. If they only 
would have listened to me . 
Q: Of course. Are you frightened now? 

A: No, I™m not frightened. 

Q: No, you™re not frightened. 

A: I™m -- I am -- I don™t know what -- what would be
 the word for that?  Apprehensive, is that the 
word for it?  Maybe. Yeah, I m
ean, it™s a crazy world, you know. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419

A: [indecipherable]. But I™m -- I™m -- I™m not 
afraid, no. I watch my step, ma ybe, you know. But 
I -- I know my kids aren™t. I don™t
 -- I don™t think Davina is af
raid. I don™t know anybody that™s 
afraid. 
Q: But everybody™s apprehensive? 

A: Oh sure.  

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: You should be. And I -- I -- I -- 
I -- I think we should be on gua
rd a lot more than -- than we 
have been. Maybe now -- ma ybe now we sh -- Of
 course [indecipherable] fault -- fault our 
governme nt. It™s easy for me  to fault the governme
nt now, but it -- but I can understand too, why 
-- why we -- because we c -- got 
away with it all these years, t
oo. Got away with it, and -- an-and 
-- and people lived -- don™t li
ke to e -- use that word fr
ee. Everything was lax, you know, 
easygoing. But we found out
 we can™t do it.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: It™s not what™s wrong with the United States
, it™s not -- it™s wrong w
ith what everybody else 
is.  
Q: Everybody else is doing. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is there anything you™d like to say about 
your experiences during 
the Holocaust that you 
haven™t talked about?  Ha ve we mi ss ed some thing? 

A: Oh, I™m s ure we™ve mi ssed lots. We mi ssed lots. 

Q: Right. 

A: I know we mi ssed a lot of the -- the horrible things
 that -- that happened
 in -- in -- in Europe, 
that the -- the -- the Germans and the Poles 
committed. And that it™s almost unbelievable, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0419  
124 
 
things they did -- that they -- 
that they did. I realize that you 
can™t hol -- hold 
it against the -- 
against the -- the -- today™s generation, but what -- wh
at they did in -- in --
 in -- in between the 
years of ™33 and ™45, for a ci -- a civilized coun
try to do that is unforgivable. Yeah, people -- 
people shouldn™t forget it
, the -- the -- the things that human 
beings are capable of doing to other 
huma n beings. That™s all we still are is human
 beings, you know, and -- 
and -- and I think -- I 
think we should always watch out for that, we
 should keep on having that -- that kind of 
government that I always complain about here. 
But -- oh yeah. Because that™s what makes the 
difference. Atrocities that today 
that happen in -- in -- in -- in 
-- in -- in -- someti mes that you 

hear about in Africa, terrible, and eastern Europe
. But this -- this was government sponsored. It™s 
the governme nt that was behind it too, not just 
by groups of -- just group
s of people. Not that 
they can™t be -- can™t be just
 as cruel, these groups can be
, but when a whole country, a 
governme nt does that, it™s not good, yes. 

Q: Not good. We ll, I want to 
thank you very muc h -- 
A: You™re welcome. 

Q: -- for being willing to talk with us today. 

A: You™re welcome. 

Q: Thank you for doing that.
