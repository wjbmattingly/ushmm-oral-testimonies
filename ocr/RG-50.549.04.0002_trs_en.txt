 Okay. The first question is an

th
.

rticular, and if so
, wh at do you know 
about that person? Tell 
me a little bit about -- 
A: The 
D
 in 
Dustin
 comes from my  great-grandfather 
David
 on my 
grandmother™s side -- on my  mom™s, of c
ourse. And they didn™t want to name me 
David
, but they took the 
D 
and went with a name that started with a 
D. 
My middle

name, 
Isaac
, I believe comes also -- comes after 
my grandfather™s father. My last 
name is artificial, it wa
s made up upon coming to  
America
. And that™s my name.  
Q: Do you -- do you relate to the people 
you were name -- named after in some 
way? Do es it have special me aning for you? 
A: I™ve seen pictures of them, but the fact
 that my name, it™s not a very strong 
connection. 

Q: You do have a Hebrew name, too. 
A: I do, 
Dav ide
, and that also -- that was translated. There was no connection. 
Q: Okay , give me a little sen -- give me 
a sense of how you s
ee your grandparents. 
What -- what -- wh-when you would -- okay,
 try to describe your grandfather a 
little bit. H o w do you see him,
 or how you saw him, if
 that -- maybe that has 
changed, even. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: When  you so rt of look back at who 
you as a -- as a smaller boy, how did you 
relate to both of them? Give me a pictur
e of who she is, or was, and how you saw 
him. 

A: This is, of course, on my mother™s 
side, and th ey are both great people, but 
quite different. My grandfather, he™s a stor
yteller, he™s tenacious, in a good way. 
He™s funny, he™s loving. He™s done so mu ch
 with his life. I™m really proud of him, 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000

and there™s a lot of aspects of him which I™d
 like to emulate in 
my self  wh en  I g r ow 
older. Not all, but a lot. 
Q: Like what? 
A: I admire his determination. His ability 
to stick to principles. I admire how he 
mad e h i ms elf u p  fro m an  immig r an t to  wh at
 he is now. I admire his courag e and 
strength that he exhibited during the war.And my  gran dmother, she™s very loving, 
she™s very emotional, whereas my  grandfat
her is not as emotional. The one thing I 
do rememb er him getting very ups
et about was I dated, brie
fly, a girl that wasn™t 
Jewish and that deeply ups
et him. But that™s over. 
Q: Did you understand why that upset him? 
A: I did, I -- I -- I certainly understood 
where he was coming from. At the time I 
was young and I had no -- no in tentions of 
having a serious lo -- relationship with 
a non-Jewish girl. That was never -- it didn™t cross my mind. I -- I do -- I do factor 
that in when I look at girl
s. But my  grandmother, getting back to  her, she™s -- well 
actually, I actually call him
 Sa bba,
 which is grandfather in  Hebrew, and I call her 
Savta. 
So ca -- is that -- can I -- 
Q: Yeah, whatever  
A: Alright, alright. 
Q: -- you just keep 
on going until you -- 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

A: And 
Savta™s
 very  loving, sh e™s very emotional, she cares a lot about everyone 
in the family. We™re especially close b
ecause I™m the eld est. And I™m also proud 
of her, she survived , she has a ton of inte
resting stories, too. Sh e speaks seven 
different languages, she™s -- and just the 
other day I found out she knows calculus 
and she™s a very intelligent woman. And she™
s in good shape, sh
e walks every day. 
And I™m very proud 
of each of them. 
Q: How do you know mu ch ab
out who they  were as -- ab-about their history, did 
you read their books, did they talk -- di-did they tell you? 
A: I™ve heard stories ever since I was old 
enough to understand wh at they meant, 
about the war. I also read 
Against All Odds
. Of course, I™ve -- I™ve known most 
of the stories that were going to be in the book before I read the book. My 

grandfather™s full of stories, he just tell
s and I treasure them because he™s a great 
storyteller. He composed a book of vigne
ttes, and over two years ago I read that, 
it™s coming out soon. And I™ve heard a lot or
ally, and I™ve read a lot. The one thing 
I -- I™ve heard a lot about hi
s boyhood, his childhood in 
Poland
. I -- I ha -- I 
haven™t really -- I started reading the book, 
A Jewish Boyhood in Poland
, but I 
didn™t finish that. 
Q: Do you think you mi
ght go actually to 
Poland
 so meday to so rt of see where 
that history started, or it 
hasn™t occurred to you yet? 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000

A: It occurred to me to go to 
Poland
 and the surrounding ar
ea, but it would have 
been part of mo re of an organization or
 a program like t h e March of the Living, 
rather than to explore hi
s childhood. But I think it w
ould be interesting to see 
where he grew up, but I don™t kn
ow what remnants there are. 
Q: Do you reme mb er -- not the book so  
mu ch, but do you rememb er parts of 
stories that they told y
ou when  you were a youngste
r, when you go back -- not 
now, but -- but then, when you were 
maybe, I don™t know, five or six or 
something? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Is there anything that is particu larly
 strong in your mind? If you could repeat 
that or talk abou t it a little bit. 

A: Well, I always picture my  grandfathe
r as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a 
partisan fighter. He was the partisan fighter
 fo r a period of time and then he join ed 
the Russian army, but that™s the image I pi
cture him, and he™s told me heroic war 
stories and the like, and that™s what come
s to mind wh en I think of him. And my  
grandmother, she™s told me stories too, and she was beau tiful, and I just picture 

her as the charmer she was, as she went 
as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole. And 
that™s the picture I get of her.

Q: Were there some stories that affected 
you in a different way? That were very 
difficult for you to -- to hear, for some reason? 
A: A lot of the stories I was told, they in
sp ired me and they made me proud of my  
grandfather. One was where he was -- he 
was shot five times by his friends who 
turned on him, and he™s obviously still a
live today. And he ha
s the bullet wounds 
to show, and -- but he -- I never heard so
 much of the atroc
ities that happened 
during th e war, only mu ch later, now. And 
I learned a lot mo re about them through 
my own reading, because I™m also very in
terested in the Holo
caust, I™ve read more 
than several books over -- on the issue, 
I™ve seen movies, and through them I™ve 
gotten a more comp lete picture. I™ve visite
d, of course, the Holo caust Museum in 
Washington, D.C., 
and 
Israel
, and -- 
Q: Was that on your -- on your own initiativ
e, or did you also learn about it in 
school? 

A: I actually -- I -- I w ent to a parochial 
school, and su rprisingly they  didn't teach 
very much about the 
Ho locaust, I™m assuming because 
they took it for granted that 
people understood what it was. We only 
briefly touched upon it in eighth grade. 
We didn™t have a very general history course. But I™m aware that a lot of my  
friends that have gone up th rough the syst
em in the public schools, they -- they  
know -- they know about wh
at the Holocaust is. They
™ve learned about it.

Q: Did you talk to your -- d-do you have 
a feeling that you kn
ew more about -- in 
a sense because you knew your grandparen
ts, or because -- or did already learn 
what you were taught in school, kind of? 
A: Abso lutely. I -- I feel that I know a lo
t, a lot mo re about the Holo caust, and 
about all -- not all the aspects, but a lot 
mo re of the aspects than my  friends, or 
than I was taught in school. And ev en in
 the books that I™ve read, because I have 
my grandfather to talk to, 
and when ever I had a question 
or -- I talked to him and I 
got firsthand feedback . 
Q: Did he ever -- did they ever, either yo
ur grandmother or your
 grandfather, come 
to school to talk about it? 
A: Well -- to my school? Not when I was 
there. They -- my grandfather, he is a 
speaker, he goes around and he constantly 
speaks at high schools, and junior high, 
colleges. He came to my  brother™s school
, which was my  old day school, but I was 
-- this was last year, so I must have been
 -- was either -- I wa
s either a sophomore 
or junior. And he spoke briefl
y, and th ey put up a plaq ue. 
Q: Do you talk to some of 
your friends, or did you talk with -- to some of your 
friends about your grandparents and ab ou
t your own thoughts 
on the Holocaust? 
A: I don™t talk about my  own th oughts 
on the Holocaust b
ecause I™m not sure 
there™s so much room in that
 aspect, I think it™s an atrocity. If I ever had a friend, 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

which I haven™t, but if someone made light 
of it, then I would. 
I do talk about my 
grandparents because, as I mentioned ear
lier, they™re just sp
ectacular people. I 
used to brag to my  best friend about 
how many languages they spoke, and how 
they -- they have a very rich past, rich 
life. They™re very impressive and I admire 
them for that, and I™ve bragged countless of times. 
Q: Is that interesting to you? I mean, to 
your friends? Do they
 want to know about 
it? 
A: It -- my friends were impressed. I -- I di
dn™t go into all the stories, but I -- I told 
them some and ther -- they™re
 entertaining, they™re funny.
 I never told them any of 
the really sad ones.  

Q: Why not? 
A: I don™t know.  

Q: You can think fo r a mo ment, if you want. 

A: I am. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 still like to know. 
A: Why didn™t I tell them sad ones? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: To be honest, I think that as they we
re my friends that I was telling these to, 
they were meant to be more
 entertaining. I was younger then. I don™t think th at it 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

would have been proper conversation material
 if I started going in to th e severity of 
the Holocaust.  
Q: Did it also feel sort of private beca
use it was something that affected your 
grandparent™s life very, very much? Do y
ou feel like a little bit, protecting that 
part, or is that over interpreting?  

A: I don™t feel that, but there is actually 
-- I have mentioned how I lost a lot of my 
mother™s -- the family on my
 mom™s side. That does come to mind, I have told 
people that, because -- cause of they™re 
-- my father and my mother™s side is 
disproportional. Bu t did I -- I did not men
tion how it actually came to be and how 
-- I me -- I know, of course, the history of 
how she hid up in th
e apartment and sh -
- the rest of her family wa
s down in  the basement, with the whole remainder of the 
apartment building. I -- I -- I me
an, I never told them that.  
Q: Do you -- have you sort of -- do you feel
 that your -- your mother™s experience 
with those -- with that -- with her parent
s was -- was -- an d hearing the stories was 
a little different than your own? Did you 
-- is there sort of a difference that you 

see? 

A: In hearing th e stories? I don™t -- 
Q: Well, in her response maybe, to them. 
A: Do you mean by her upbr
inging, and how -- how -- 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
10
Q: Yeah. That you were maybe a little b
it more removed from it,
 I mean, that you 
can sort of -- I don™t know, I™m just fish
ing right now, to se
e whether -- you were 
listening, are you -- do you fe
el that you are listening to  -- to your grandparents 
maybe in a slightly different way th an your mo ther could? 
A: I don™t know if I™m listening to them differently, because I feel th at I have a 

very strong connection to 
them. But I™m positive they ha
d a much more profound 
influence on her just because
 she lived under them, and sh
e must have told you in 
the other tapes. And I was just more 
removed from living with them, and they 
came up and wh en th ey came up, I -- you know, 
I had to finish all the food on my  
plate. But she had to live with
 that, so in that way I th ink she was more profoundly 
affected. I mean, she would -- never even 
would have consid ered to date someone 
that was not Jewish, whereas I did, despite
 I -- it greatly upset my  mo m, and even 
more so my grandparents. 

Q: What does it mean for y
ou to be Jewish? What --  
A: To be Jewish is, for me 
it™s my identity and fo
r me it™s more a part of me than a 
religious aspect, it™s more a way of life a
nd a sense of pride in my identity, like I 
would say th at I™m Jewish not because I be
lieve in all the aspects of Judaism. I 
don™t keep  
ka shrut
 and I don™t pray three times a 
day. And I™m not absolutely the 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
11
mo st religious person I know. And yet I st
rongly iden tify my self as a Jew, and am 
very proud to be a Jew. And in that se
nse I feel that that™s my  connection. 
Q: You speak Hebrew . 
A: I do.  
Q: When  -- when  did you -- did you learn that in school, or --  

A: I -- I did learn Hebrew at school. I™v
e learned some at home, my  dad speaks 
Hebrew, very, very archaically, 
it™s the equivalent to what 
Shakespeare
 would be 
to English. It -- he speaks perfect Hebrew
, wh ereas it hasn™t been modified by th e 
slang and the colloquial of 
Israel
. My gran dmother also speaks Hebrew. Sh e 
taught it. 
Q: Did you go to 
Israel
? 
A: I™ve been to 
Israel 
s 
-- 
many times. I love 
Israel.
 I -- 
Q: Talk a little bit more ab
out -- about the country, what
 you love about it, and 
also about the family that you th
e -- that you have there, maybe. 
A: I -- I don™t know wh ere to begin about 
Israe 
-- it™s -- you know, it™s a huge 
topic, it™s beautiful in every way. The pe
ople are beautiful, the land is beautiful, 
the culture is beautiful. But 
my family, I -- I -- I do have 
family there. I™m not very 
close to much of it, except for my gran
dmother™s sister, whos
e my  grand-aunt, and 
I™ve been -- she used to have a 
kibbutz
 in 
Isr ael
 and I was there sev eral times, and 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

12
I visit her every time I go up to 
Israel, 
and so me of my  cousins, but besides that 
there™s some fami ly I don™t know. 
Q: You just don™t know them well enough, or you don™t relate to them for some 
reason? 
A: I don™t even think I™v
e met all o f my family. 
Q: Let™s talk about the family of your 
-- the other grandparents, from -- from your 
father™s sid e. 
A: From my  dad™s? 
Q: Yeah. Ho w do you -- how are they
, how do you relate to them? 
A: My -- my grandparents on his side? I -- I 
don™t really relate to
 them at all. I™m 
not close to his mo ther, and his father 
died at a young -- when  I was young. I 
wasn™t very close to him either. I was 
always much, much 
mo re clo se to  my  
mother™s parents than my father™s. And th at -- that was since I was a young child. 

[indecipherable] 
question. 
Q: And had that to do, had -- yeah, sort of. 
I just have -- always have a little follow 
up. 

A: Yeah, that™s okay. 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
13
Q: Did th at have to do with who they were
, or did that have to do with that you 
just were more exposed to them, that you 
lived  mo re closely to them, and then  you 
get to know them better, or something 
[indecipherable]
 
A: They -- they both live w
ithin a half an hour away 
and they™re each five hours 
from here, so no, we -- I went up, I saw eac
h of them. We actually always slept at 
my  father™s mo m™s house. I -- I -- I don™t 
-- I don™t connect to her as I do to my  
mo m™s parents. I honestly would like to 
be like my  grandfather in so many ways. 
He™s an impressive man. I love my  grandm
other on my  mo m™s side too, sh e™s very 
kindhearted and sweet and warm and inte
lligent. And I don™t see that in my 
grandmother on my father™s side. I -- nothi
ng strikes me as special about her. I 
don™t want to say that because -- 
Q: Okay, we™ll leave th at -- never mind, we™ll just leave it at that. I d on™t -- 

A: -- no, well, why don™t we do that. 

Q: -- that -- that™s all right, I just want
 to know mo re about the other grandparents 
anyway. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Let™s go to your siblings. Do  you -- 
d-do they have as -- do you think, from 
your perspective, do they have a similar 
relationship to your 
grandparents -- now 
talking ab out your mo th er™s parents. 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
14
A: Oh. 
Q: Or is there a different -- 

A: They™re too young, and they  -- my  gran
dparents are getting older, less patient. I 
-- th-there™s tension between the two occasi
onally. My -- out of th e two sides, my  
grandparents and my  brothers. They get alon
g, but I don™t feel they have the same 
relationship that I do. 

Q: When  you talk to  each other, your siblings
[indecipherable]
 are there questions 
that they ask you that they 
don™t ask them, and -- to try to explain certain things, or 
do they relate to certain  stories that they
 may have heard, diffe
rently than you? Do 
you have one example? I mean, I don™t wa
nt to belabor this, but if there™s 
something -- 

A: Regarding the Holocaust at least, as
 I said, I think they™re too young still. 
Aaro n™s 
turning 13, 
Michael™s
 10, and th ey™re mu ch mo
re interested in video 
games. 
Q: You heard it at five 
though, or at four -- 
A: Well, I was told th
ese stories firsthand. 
Q: Right. 
A: At that point I was much more in cont
act with my mother™s 
parents. I saw them 
-- we went up, and down to  
New Jersey
. They came up much more frequently. 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
15
And -- I™m trying to  think back when I st
arted reading all those books about the 
Holo caust. And I would have -- I™d say 
yeah , you know, maybe 12, maybe 13. 
Q: Was it difficult for you to so rt of acc
ept that something like that cou-could 
happen? Did you have, sort of, questions
 that you wondered about things, and 
could you bring that up somewher
e, if you had those questions? 
A: I did have questions. One of my ques
tions was my grandparents still believed 
in God. It™s such a enormous event, the Ho
locaust, it™s not easy 
to just treat -- even 
in an interview like this -- how can some
one not wonder why something like that 
happened ? And even  when  we see it ag
ain everywhere. Even  now it™s -- I don™t 
know, I -- I-I -- I feel it™s different 
though. I feel like -- I d on™t know.  
Q: Try. What™s -- what™s the diff -- 
what™s the -- what™s the difference?  
A: Between -- for me, the Holocaust, from 
the pictures I™ve created, from pictures 

I™ve seen, photographs, from movies, from books I™ve read, from my  grandfather™s 

story, it just see ms so much
 more atrocious than anythi
ng even now in the world 
today wh ere similar things happen. 
Kosovo
 and Serbs, and -- an
d I just think it™s 
so much more terrible, and I -- I don™t know
 if that™s right, but I-I relate more to  
the Holo caust, obviously. 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
16
Q: Okay . Let™s talk a little bit about y
our family now. Ho
w do you see -- how do 
you see your mom and your dad 
and your siblings? Sort of 
describe a little bit the -
- the family , the relatio nships that you have. 
A: Well, I™ll start it out with my mom, cause I probably have the closest 
relationship with her. And she™s a very 
warm woman just like my  grandmother. 
She™s very understanding. We -- as I child
, I -- I must have -- you know, I -- she 
was always the one that would buy me clot
hes and take me to get a haircut. I was 
always closer to her than my father. And 
I used to play  games with her and chess 
and ev ery night she used  to sing me 
Shema
 and sh e used to read to me. I™m very 
close to her. A couple -- and part of it wa
s because I had a girlfriend that was, in 
addition to being non-Jewish, not really th
e nicest of people. And my mom and her 
didn't  get along at all. And that, maybe
 my mom™s work, other aspects led to 
tension and for the last year or so things
 have become mo re tense and she™s had a 
shorter fuse and been more 
irate. But now I -- now that 
I broke up with her, my -- 
my ex-girlfriend now, I feel that things are getting -- you know, they  are mu ch 
better. I™m very close to my mom again, I ha
rdly fight. With my dad also, I don™t -
- we used fight all the time, it used to be
 an issue of he™d say do this, I™d no, I 
don™t want to. Now, I -- I -- 
I help out. You know, he ins
tilled in me a set of values 
that™s th -- what the two of 
them really wanted to achieve, and I think th ey have.

His main goal was to leave a legacy behi
nd, and I think he accomp lished that, and 
I get along with both of them now. 
Q: In terms of a legacy, in terms of wh
at, a f -- a family, a profession of life? 
A: His legacy on my -- my 
dad™s legacy would have to be one of principle. My 
grandfather™s -- of course he wants to le
ave a legacy behind, and th at is of the 
Holo caust and his survival. And he feels,
 and I feel the same way, that he 
shouldn™t survive to s ee his heritage lost.  
Q: Do you feel that you want
 to contribute, or that you can, or that you even  
should contribute to that 
in  so me way ,  to  k eep  memo ry  aliv e, so me wh at? 
A: I certainly do. And I don™
t doubt for a second that 
I will be telling my children 
and showing them in the movies, and readin
g them the books, of course when  they 

become old enough to be
 able to understand. And teaching th em about the 
Holocaust too, because
 I think it™s extremely important
 that they know what their 
heritage is and where they came from. 
Q: Yeah, I think we should flip over the casse
tte at this p o int. This is the end of

Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum 
interview with 
Dustin Dezube. 
This is tape number one, side
 B.
 Okay, let™s talk 
about your own aspirations then , for your
 own family. How do 
you think you™re 
going to  bring up your own 
kids, if you want them? 
A: I do want kids, and I would like them to
 r emain Jewi sh as 
well. I, myself, when 
I was dating a non-Jew as I mentioned -- 
I would never marry a non-Jew. If it was 
a non-Jew I was dating seriously, I would 
exp -- implicitly -- 
although I would 
have to bring it up at one point, that 
she would convert to Judaism. If I had a 
daughter, I would want her to marry a Jew, 
as well as if I had 
a son, although I™m 
not sure I would disown 
them as I™ve often been 
threatened myself by my 
grandparents. I would be ve
ry disappointed , and I th
ink that would put some 
tension on our relationship. I 
hope though that won™t be an issue, and I hope to 
raise my  daughter with the noti
on that that™s how it should be. 
Q: Your grandfather to ld me that you went to 
Israel
 once with a youth group, 
right? 

A: I did. 

Q: What -- what did you do, what was the 
purpose of th at trip and wh at did you do 
there? 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

A: It was sponsored by the 
sawha,
 which is the Israeli army, and I toured 
Israel
 
with members of the army
, and I participated in 
gono f 
for a couple weeks, which 
is boot camp, basically. And I went ar
ound and I got a new perspective than 
another tour group might have given me. It
 was very interesting and I connected, 
and I™ve often been asked to join  the Amer
ican army now that I™m a senior. I have 
recruiters calling me constantly, but if I was to join an army, 
I™d much rather be 
part of the 
sawha
 than the 
United States
 army. 
Q: Why? 
A: I feel I connect to them mo re. I -- I connect to 
Israel 
more than 
America
 
because in 
Israel
 everyone™s Jewish. I have fam
ily there, and I have a history 
going back. I have learned ab out it since I was five years old, about 
Israel, 
about 
the temples, about the western wall, the 
[indecipherable]
, everything. 
Q: What about your friends
 here? Are they all Jewish
, or do you also have non-
Jewish frie nds? 
A: I have -- I live -- I u sed to be shelte
red in a paroch ial school, and all of my  
friends were then Jewish. When I entered 
high school, the atmo sphere is not, of 
course all Jewish, and I have a lot of frie
nds that are not Jewish. But I do live in a 
community that despite being, you know, o-
open to ev eryone, of course, there is a 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

large percentage of Jews. It™s a large Jewi
sh community. So I do have friends that 
are non-Jews, and I -- but I also have a lot of friends that are Jews. 

Q: What kind of hobbies do 
you have, and wh at do you wa
nt to become, in terms 
of profession, what are, 
sort of, your aspirations? 
A: I like to play pool. I like 
to play basketball. I -- my -- 
in terms of profession, I -- 
I want to go into gene therapy. 
I think that™s a fascinatin g field. 
Q: Into gene therapy
? 
A: Gene therapy, I™m taking an
 internship next semester  a t 
Genzyme
, which is a -- 
it -- it works with genes, it™s a genetic industry. 

Q: What interests you particularly about th
at, the scientific challenge, the -- I don™t 
want to lead you here, just -- 

A: The scientific challenge. It™s a breakt
hough field. What -- 
it -- it has so little 
boundaries, it™s amazing. You could take it 
anywhere. It™s the building blocks of 
life, you can understand everything, it™s just 
so fascinating. That™s another issue, 
it™s -- it™s h ard to go into. I -- th
is diverges completely from -- 
Q: That™s okay. 

A: -- the Holocaust, but -- 
Q: It™s part of your life though, so -- 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

A: It -- it is. But with genes, you can -- 
you can fix wh at went wrong in natu re. If 
someone has diabetes, you can insert the ri
ght sequence. And it™s so small, but you 
can insert it into them and 
they  can start producing insu
lin themselves, rather th an 
have to take it from a pig. And that™s 
amazing, I think, that you can change 
something like that and of course once 
you get on that level, and if -- we™re not 
there yet, but eventually you can cure all sorts of things, a
ll ailments, you know, 
cancer, you can -- and I don™t want -- I don™t 
want to tamp er with hu-humanity and 
I -- it™s not my idea to make a perfect 
race, or you know, 
make everyone™s 
IQ
 150. 
But just to help pe
ople that have specific ailments.  

Q: How do you feel about today™s 
Germany. 
Have you ever talked to a German?  
A: I™ve never talked to a German that wa
sn™t Jewish, except I -- I know one girl 
that™s German, but she™s -- she™s a clas
smat e , she™s -- she™
s younger than me. 
She™s a freshman now. And never about her. 

Q: No. 
A: You™re the first German I™ve probably 
sp oken to and -- and I -- you™ve told me 
some things, and I -- I have wondered, do 
Germans relate to the Holocaust? What 
is there -- what™s the general attitude an
d I™m extremely interested over what it 
would be for the different generations. 
How -- what -- what did survivors from 
that period -- or not survivors, but the ge
neration in -- that participated in the 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

Holocaust, what do they feel now? Wh
at do their -- what does the second 
generation feel, what about the third? An
d yeah, I have wond
ered about that.  
Q: And there are few books here, right? 
One can™t really read about it much. 
A: I haven™t seen anything about that. 
Q: Could you imagine going to  
Germany
? 
A: I could. I could imagine going to 
Germany
, and I think th at would be 
worthwhile to find out. 
Q: When  you heard that I would interview 
you today, wh at did you sort of -- have 
I asked you the question that you expected 
me to ask, or is there something that 
you really wanted to talk about? 

A: Some of the questions were different
, but they were along the lines that I 
expected. I wasn™t sure if you™d go mo re in
to depth over the Holo caust itself, and 
hit different aspects of that. But aside 
from that, I -- I feel that you™ve covered 
everything that I expected and more.  

Q: Mm. I guess that was the question -- 
A: This is a -- 

Q: -- more like should we
, is there something missing that we sort of
 --
 
A: Yeah 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000 
 

 
 
23
Q: -- sort of should address in terms of 
friends, interests, your grandparents, your 
family. 
A: I mean, there™s some topics that 
I could go and on ab out if time permitted. 
Q: Like what -- now that you mention it. 
That was a dangerous thing to mention. 
Like what? 
 
A: Well -- 

Q: 
Israel. 
A: Not -- not even 
Israel
 but my -- my grandparents
, you know. I mean, I™ve had 
such a close relationship to them, and they
™v e profoundly influe
nced my life, an d I 
could just go on about that for -- 
Q: D-Do that a little bit more, if y ou don™t mind. 
A: It™s just that they -- th
ey™v e had a very strong impact on me, not -- not just in 
terms of the Holocaust, but it was always 
up to their expectations that I hoped to 
live. I-I-In terms of grades, I used to tell 
them how well I did in school, and not so 
mu ch my  parents, that I care about wh
at they  -- what they  thought, but my  
grandparents. I never wanted -- I mean, I st
ill do -- I don™t ever want to disappoint 
them. And I always try very hard  not to
, whether it™s by getting good grad es or 
dating a Jew. And it meant alwa ys a lot to
 me, what they thought, their opinions. 

And I -- I -- I -- I love them, they™re just
 incredible people. And th ey came up for 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube  
 
December 7, 2000

my  
Bar Mitzvah
, they came up for my graduation 
from eighth grade. We™re very 
close. I remember from my 
[indecipherable]
 graduation, whic
h was Hebrew high 
school, it was the Sunday school that I c
ontinued, my  grandfather came up, even 
after there was some issue w
ith his heart. And I™m -- it 
me-meant a lot to me, and 
I™m -- I™m -- I just try to, not make them
 happy, but live my life in a way that 
would make them proud. Whereas I don™t do th
at for my  father™s mom, or -- or for 
even my parents, because 
I™m -- I™m close en ough to 
my parents -- I -- I-I™m close 
enough to my grandparents that I wantto live up to th eir expectations, but I™m 
removed enough that I can -- that I can tr
y to do th at, whereas at home with my 
mom and my father, of course, they see ev
erything what™s going on every single 
day. They  know wh en something happens 
if I -- if I missed school today, if I 
played hooky. So it -- it™s a different re
lationship. And I wo
uld never want to 
really present -- I only want to present th
e best to my  grandp
arents, whereas my 
parents get the whole -- the whole deal. 
Q: The whole deal, huh? 
A: Yeah, absolutely. 

Q: Yeah, well that™s -- that™s -- parents have to deal -- 
A: I want them to be -- I want my
 grandparents to be proud of me. 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

Q: Do you think there™s a lit
tle bit more patience in you
 deali -- being with your 
grandparents, a little more 
patience with how them dea
ling with you, than with 
your mother in this, somewhere? 
A: In terms of? 
Q: In terms of with each other? Do you 
think you have more 
patience for your -- 
who your grandparents are than your moth
er could have, maybe, for some reason? 
A: Um -- 
Q: Is it easier sometimes 
to be more understanding a little bit than -- across two 
generations apart than maybe from gene
ration to  generation, I don™t know. 
A: All right, I think I see what
 you™re asking. I m -- live in 
[indecipherable]
 I live 
a bunch of idioms in our language, sayi
ngs that sum up that some things don™t 
change. And you know, you let -- they™re 
two generations beyond, it™s not wo rth 
fighting over some certain points. And I 
-- I understand that. I understand wh ere 
my grands-parents are coming 
from when they wanted me 
to eat everything in my 
plate. And maybe my mom wasn™t able 
-- she was a little less patient, but just 

probably  because she had to live with it, 
whereas I don™t, and it™s -- it™s -- it™s -- it 

can be an ordeal. I have to
 -- I mean, as much as I l
ove my  grandparents, every 
time they come up I have to prep  my self because I don™t have the luxury of ju st 

going to  sleep wh en I™d want, you know I 
have to spend time with them, which I 

 
Interview with Dustin Dezube

like to do, but I -- I can™t go
 out then, and if I had to 
live with that constantly, 
maybe.  
Q: We™re jump ing back  and forth, but maybe
 that™s kind of interesting in  itself, 
too. A lo t of people talk about lessons of
 the Holo caust. For you personally, what -

- what is something that you draw from -- 
from that terrible 
event, from knowing 
about it in ways that we ca
nnot talk about quite, because
 the time is too short, and 
it™s too complex. But sort of what are th
e lessons, quote unquote, as you see them? 
At least now. 

A: The lessons are that you have to be 
proud of who you are. My mom tries to 
instill that in me. My grandparents triedto. And that believe it -- I th ink it™s true, 
you -- you can™t just not -- yo
u -- you have to maintain a 
strong sense of identity to 
preven t these things from happening in  th
e future. I™m getting ba
ck to the point I 
was saying, that even though I™m not really
 religious, I strongly
 identify myself as 
a Jew. And you need to stand up for that. 

Q: As an American, to o? 
A: As American, too. I think if peopl
e wanted  me to, I don™t know, become a 
Canadian, I don™t -- maybe. I strongly iden
tify my self -- not s -- even mo re as a 
Jew than as American. American
 is where I live. There™s y --
 America
™
s 
a big 
mixing pot, there™s all differe
nt cultures. I™m a Jew.
