Q: This is a continuation of the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Irene Silver
. And you were talki ng about your 
experience raising your children and Œ and thei r religious Œ  
A: Affiliations? 
Q: Yeah, mm-
hm.
 
A: Well, that was about it, as far as that, you know, that Œ they™re Œ they™re all 
bringing up their children in the Jewish tradition. Since I was never that deeply 
steeped in religion, certainly I Œ I don™t feel that the y should be doing anything 

different. And Œ but I™m happy about the Œ the wa y that t hey are bei ng brought up 

in. 

Q: Oka y. Oka y. Are you more comfortable wit h people who lived through the war, 
than let™s sa y Americans here, who never had to experience what you experienced? 
Are you angry that others Œ that you had t o experience things that others didn™t have 

to, by living in a different country? 

A: No. I am basically Œ I™m basically very tolerant. I don™t  judge other people, and 

the fact that I had to live through t he war, and others didn™t, I™m happy that some 

people didn™t have t o experience it. Of course, I™m angry that Œ that t he people who 

were there, and Œ and suffered, that Œ that, of course, is a very deep anger, but you

can™t be angry forever, you can™t think about it  forever, or your life will become 
miserable. And am I more comfortable? Not necessarily. I have very close friends 

who have never gone t hrough an Œ through it. But I do feel more comfortable, and 

be f Œ and Œ and are close to those friends of mine who Œ who underst and, as much 

as the y can, what happened. I don™t think I would be very comfortabl e with people 
who sa y, well, you know, what happened, happened, and let™s just forget about it . I 
would not want to hear that. There™s one ot her thing that someti mes comes up, and 

it really, I t hink is unfair and bothers me; i s when people sa y, well, why didn™t the 

Jews rise up? Why did the y just go there like sheep? Well, ti mes were very 

different.Civilians did nothaveany arms. They couldn™t d
efend themselves against 

an arm y. How could a civilian wit hout any arms, stand up to an army, with Œ with 

guns and ammunit ion, and Œ and tanks, and everything else. And in the end, there 
were those who were still survivi ng in the ghetto, who di d fight, and t hey fought to 
the end. But that was at the very, very end, and the y felt the y woul d try t o do 

anyt hing t he y could. But the general popul ation, they had no wa y to defend 

themselves. In the begi nning, nobody knew about the concentration camps, at least I 

don™t know if they Œ that™s what I hear, that  they didn™t know. I certai nly was too 

young to know anyt hing like that. But I don™t know if my family knew about the 

camps. I thi nk that eventually it became clear that people who went never came

back, and they Œ that there were these camps. But I just don™t want to hear people 
sayi ng, why did t he y not fight back? I™d like t o see how they would feel if they were 

in that situation. Now of course, anybody can get a gun, and anybody, just about, 

can defend themselves. But I don™t know what would happen if that ever happened 

again, I hope it never does, but y- you should never judge people if you have not 
been in that  situation. 
Q: Are you a different person because of what you experienced? 

A: Yes. When I was still with my parents, even in the ghetto, I was not only Œ 
I was 

an only chi ld. I was Œ trying to think of the right word, I was doted upon. My 

mother would feed me Œ first the nan Œ m y nanny and then m y mother would feed 

me til I was probably about seven or eight years old, because I didn™t like to eat. 
And so there was al ways somebody taking care of me, I was really well taken care 
of. And because I was with my family, and with Œ with m y parents, I didn™t feel that 
I had to behave in any certain wa y. I don™t know how I did behave, but I™m sure I 

could do whatever I reall y wanted, if it was safe. But when I left the ghetto, and I 

was with strangers, I learned to be not only obedient, but not to annoy other people. 

And so I think that I became more tolerant of others. I think that I was spoiled when 

I was very young, but I didn™t gr Œ but after that I didn™t grow up very spoiled, I Œ I 

alwa ys had to Œ when a child grows up li ke my children, for instance, if you are not

happy about something, you let your parents know. Well, when the y™re not your 
parents, you™re not goi ng to let them know. And even Œ even wit h my aunt and 

uncle,who werecertai nly m y closest family, butstill,t he ywere not m y parents. 

And so, I was very careful most of my life, as t o how I behaved. Now, other than 

that, I Œ I don™t know if I would have grown up to be a social worker. Probably not, 
if the war hadn't  happened. I don™t  know what  Œ what would have happened, what 
kind of person I would have been, if the Œ 
t he war 
hadn't happened. I would ho
pe 
that m y war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about 

others. 

Q: What about an i nner strength, t o cope with crises?  

A: Well, I haven™t reall y made up m y mind about that, because I™ve had a number 

of crises in my life since the war. Health crisis, basically. And someti mes I think 
that those Œ  that when you have a lot of trauma in your life, that makes you 
stronger, but someti mes I think, might work the other way. And I haven™t really 

come to any conclusion on that, for m yself. I think I am Œ I think with age you 

become stronger. I Œ I Œ I think most people will sa y that the y™re stronger than t he y 
were when t he y were younger. I know I Œ I Œ I was much Œ not t hat I™m a noisy 

person, but  I was more of a quiet, do what others want you to do person. I will stand

up for myself more now. But that ma y be age. I don™t know if it just makes Œ if it™s 
m y experience.
 
Q: Do you receive reparations?  

A: I got some, yes. I Œ I didn™t Œ I did not  want to. When I was in m y 20s, m y uncle 

saidto me onc
e 
Œ asked me if I wanted to appl y for it, and m Œ I said, I don™t want 
any mone y from 
G ermany
, they cannot repa y me. And I didn™t for the longest, 
longest ti me, apply for anything. And then eventually, I did, and it Œ I did because I 
Œ it changed my view upon it. I thought t hen, will never repay me, but if m y life can 

be madealittlebetter, maybeit™ll help m y chi ldren,then whynot?Why should it 

stay there, I™d rather have it here. And so the Œ 
ma 
Œ m y son actually has done all  Œ 

anyt hing t hat™s been done, it™s m y older son has started that. He pushed me into 

everything t hat I have done on thi s Œ in t his area, and that Œ that™s about it, what 
happened lat ely. 
Q: Do you dream about  the war years? 

A: No. At least, I don™t usually remember what I dream about, so it Œ I don™t know. 

Ma ybe I do, but I Œ I honestly don™t know. 
Q: Were you active in t he civil rights movement, because what happened to the 

Jews, being deprived of their civil rights?  

A: No. I mean, I certainl y sympathize with them.

Q: Yeah. 
A: But I wasn™t act ive i n it. I was very busy rai sing m y family. I really Œ I felt 

terrible about all of Œ al l of it, and Œ and wished everybody all Œ you know, to get all 

their rights, and everyt hing. I alwa ys felt that way, but I would not say that I Œ 
I was 

an
 Œ active i n it, no.  
Q: What were your t houghts about the 
Eichmann
 trial? Did that  bring up any 

memories for you? 

A: It didn™t bring up memories, but I was certainly glad t hat the y had gotten ahold 

of him, and Œ and what ever punishment was due, let Œ 
let t
hat happen then. And I™m 

certainly upset about some of the people who have gotten away in Œ in 
Argenti na
 

or wherever the y went. I think that that™s a shame. I kind of feel that I was more 

immersed in Œ in Œ wit h m y family, and m y work, rather than Œ I Œ I did not think 
about it unless it came up on the news, or something like that. 

Q: Do you feel that lessons have been learned, the world has learned any lessons 

from this? 

A: No. I don™t. I Œ I think that Œ I t hought so at first, for many years I did think so. 

But now, l ooking around, I think people Œ there are those who wil l try t o get rid of 

anybody who doesn™t think their way, or who they don™t like, or don™t want to deal 
with, and Œ  
an
-and Œ and as far as 
Israel
 is concerned, I thi nk it™s Œ I can™t do 

 
Interview with Irene Silver

any
t hing about it, so I try not to be Œ la Œ I™m really, really concerned and I just feel 
that after everything is said and done, I don™t know if they™ll ever be peace. And 
that Œ that™s a very sore point with me, cause I feel that people who Œ who really 

built the country from nothing, why shouldn™t the y finally have some peace? But Œ 

and Œ and I suppose they do to a certain extent, but they™re alwa ys under this siege, 
and I worry about 
Iran
, and their nuclear bomb, and Œ but I think that 
Israel
 
has to 
just Œ 
something, and ma ybethey will.I 
Œ I don™t think the y™re j ust going to go 
quietly anywhere. So, I Œ I feel that Œ I worry about it. I worry about everything 

that™s happening in the world. It™s Œ it™s Œ it™s j ust not a Œ not a peaceful ti me, and I 

worry about the future for my chil dren, grandchildren, and really it ™s Œ I do.  

Q: Are you a member of any survivor groups? 

A: I was. I Œ for a number of years, I was part of the hidden children group in 
Rockland 
county. It was a small group, and maybe there were 25 of us. And we 
used to meet on the weekly Œ on a monthly basis, and I found a l ot of common 

ground with Œ wit h Œ with them. The y Œ the y all Œ we were all more or less in the 

same kind of Œ in the same page. And I™m Œ so, sometimes I Œ I write to one or two 

of them, but that was a close group, and I reall y Œ  that was from t he 
Marriott
 hotel 
we started that, after that. However, when I came to the united Œ when I came to 

Washington
 area, there is a group, but it™s a very, very large group. It™s

Washington
 hidden children. The y had been a group for about 20 years, even 
before any of that. And I went to a couple of meetings, I really tri ed. But I™m not 
terribly outgoing. Ma ybe that™s part of the problem. And I didn™t feel Œ the y said 

they welcomed me, but  the y were such a cl Œ such a close group, t he y knew all 

about each other™s background. The y had a hi story, and t he Œ it™s very hard to get 
into somet hing that Œ and I Œ after a while I stopped going. So I don™t belong to Œ 
Q: Have you Œ 
have you 
been to the Holocaust  Museum building? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What are your thoughts when you walk in there? 

A: Well, it was very Œ first time I Œ first of all, I went to the opening with 
Elie 

Wiesel
, and all that. And I will never, ever forget that, because that was extremely 

emotionalfor me. And I 
Œ I cry easi ly anywa y, but it was a Œ 
all m y childrencame, 
and we were all there. It was the rai niest da y possible, and I thought – that™s 

probably the wrong thing to start talking about. I thought it must be t he Œ the 

heavens coming down, crying. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But anyway, I Œ I did go to that, and then I did go to t he museum one ti me. And I 

think it™s extremely well put together. It™s Œ it™s a place that  other people can come

and see what Œ what  was done. It was very realistic, and I was very emotional about 
it. 

Q: Mm-hm. Oka y 
[indecipherabl e]
 oka y. 
A: Did you want t o put it on? 

Q: Yeah. So, we were t alking about you Œ you going into the bui lding itself, and the 
exhibits. Did you go upstairs to any of the exhi bits when you went int o the 
building?  

A: Ye-Yes.  

Q: Now, I-I™m not talki ng about the ti me of dedication now, obvi ousl y. 

A: No, I know. Oh, I Œ I did go through t he Œ 

Q: And that section on the 
Warsaw
 ghetto?  
A: I don™t know. I™m Œ I Œ I went through t he whole thing, I™m Œ I Œ I think so. 
Q: Yeah, okay, so it didn™t have particular Œ  
A: But it was very Œ 
it was many years ago.
 
Q: Yeah, okay, so you didn™t have particular memories of going through the sect ion 
of the 
Warsaw
 ghetto. 
A: Oh, I tel l you t he truth, tried to kind of go t hrough. I d Œ I didn™t Œ I couldn™t 

handle just Œ 

Q: Yeah.

A: Œ you know, taking every little Œ everything in. I Œ I just coul dn™t. So I paced 
m yself rather quickly. 

Q: Mm-
hm, yeah, yeah.
 

A: I went back 10 years later, to the rededication, o
r you know when the yhadthat 
Œ 
the 10 year anniversary? And I felt Œ now that was a summer da y, the sun was 
shining, and I was with my husband and m y son. And I said, this is so much bet ter. 
We have gone through 10 years. And not t hat there has been healing, but I think 

we™re kind of past some of the things. And I j ust felt that it was al most like rebirth. 

That™s how I felt. It was just Œ the whole at mosphere was so much different than the 

dedication, which wasj ust
, I thought it was so very traumat ic for me. I didn™t know 

why really. I Œ I Œ I Œ I just felt very traumatized. Not traumatized, but emotional  

about it. And then when we came back, it was different, 10 years later. I™m glad t hat 
it™s there. I™m Œ I™m just good Œ 
Q: Why are you glad? 

A: Because I think that , not so much for us who have survived, but Œ but for those 

who ha Œ who didn™t. They™re not forgotten. That™s why I think it™s i mportant. The 

room with the shoes was just too much.

Q: Is there anything else you woul d like t o sa y before we end the interview? Any 
thoughts that you have, any message to your grandchildren possibly, that you would 

want to sa y to them? 

A: Be strong, follow your star. Don™t forget what happened, but  don™t be burdened 

by it. You have to go on with your life, and make th
e 
Jewish people proud, whi ch I 
know you will. And I l ove you. That™s it. 
Q: That™s a beautiful note to end on. 

A: I™m sorry about all Œ I just Œ 
m y 
Œ 
m y chil drenknow me,and so whensomething 
emotional comes up, oh, here comes Mom. So, I™m sorry about t hat, but I should 

have brought a whole box of Œ 

Q: Well, thank you Œ 

A: I thought this was going to be a real dry interview. 
Q: Well, thank you so much for doing the interview. 
A: You™re very welcome. I hope t hat it becomes part of something bigger than just 

one person.
