This is tape number one, side A. 

Answer: Good morning, this is Paul 
Strassmann. I-I™m being interviewed by 
Margaret West in my home in New 
Canaan , Connecticut on January 8
th
, 2004. I am 
Paul Strassman who was born in  Trencin, January  24, 1929. 

Q: I™d first like to ask you to te
ll me about your early ch ildhood.  
A: The earliest that I rememb
er o f my childhood was the -- the ritu als of the family 
that revolved around Jewish holidays. Th
e peak holiday was, 
of course, always 
Pesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the di
shes had to be changed. And lots of 
cooking took place. I always
 ran errands for my mother, helping her out. And I 
remember, perhaps as early as
 at the age of four or five, I learned how to  pull the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076

dough to  make a streudel-thin dough. Th
ese are all trivial examples of what I 
remember.  
Q: Tell me more about those family trad
itions and rituals, o-other observances, 

birthdays, religious holidays. 

A: The Jewish community in
 Trencin consisted of a
bout 2,000 souls out of a 
population of about 19,000, so it was a ve
ry large Jewish community. The Jewish 

community was centered around the school
, which was a parochial school, and the 
synagogue. The -- the -- so fa
r as I can remember, my gr
andfather always took me 
to prayers on Saturd
ay morning. There was regulated 
holidays that had to be kept, 
and my mother maintained or
iginally, during the 30™s, before the trouble started, 
she maintained a kosher home. It was a -- 
a Jewish religious procedure that didn™t 
make mu ch sense to me. What particularly 
didn't make sense to me is that all the 
praying was done in ancient Hebrew, and 
I didn™t understand a wo rd of it. They 
never tried to teach us what all of this 
mumbo-jumbo meant. As a matter of fact, my 
father, although he was one of the lead
ing lights of the community, was known to 
be highly critical of th e local rabbi for ne
ver speaking Slovak, or even German that 
people could understand. So  there was this
 peculiar dichotomy, on th e one hand of a 

very formal, ritualized religious experi
ence and a gradual rebellion ag ainst the -- 
which was largely engendered by the time 
I was about seven, by my association 
with the local Zionist organization, co 
-- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
4
organization, who was, at least mi ldly
 speaking, anti-religious, socialist, 
communalist, and totally rejecting the existe
nce in the -- in the 
-- in the -- in the -- 
in the Slovak environment and totally fo
cused on everybody 
getting out and moving 
to Palestine, and to live in a kibbutz in
 a communal Utopian environment. And as 
time went on, this influence became str
onger and stronger, because that was a 

community that made lots of sense. The 
songs were very good. The -- the s-singing 
in the synagogue was always wailing. The -- the -- the singing in  the Hashomer 
Hatzair was very zippy. Subsequently I 
found out that mu ch of the communist 
singing was actually stolen fro
m the Zionists, and -- but th
e songs were very strong. 
I always said, years later, that the communi
sts and the leftists always had the best 
songs and the ugliest girls.
 But the songs were great, and the entertainment was 

great, and there was a great deal of hiking
, and -- and sort of rebellion organization -
- r-rebellions -- rebellious thi
nking against the environmen
t that was closing in on 
us, already starting in ™36. 

Q: Now, you were only seven when you jo
ined  this organization, so obviously it 
was with your full family blessing. 

A: Well, I wouldn™t say so. My grandf
ather, th e religious grandfather highly 
disapproved of it, but my  sister, Ella alre
ady was part of this religious and -- anti-

religious attitude, and she had 
joined Hashomer Hatzair be
fore me, so she sort of 
dragged me in. And also, one of the teacher
s in the Jewish school was a -- a rebel.

He turned out to be, subs
equently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of 
course, they  shot him afterwards in th
e anti -- anti-Communist purges. But -- so 
there was a very lively environment going 
on, a tremendous amount of change, and 
a great deal of debates about the future 
and ideas. So I was exposed to ideas like 
that very early 
in my childhood. 
Q: Hm. How much older than you was E
lla? What -- when would she have been  
born? 

A: My sister Ella was born 
in 1925, so she was four -- 
almo st four and a half o -- 
years older than me, and I™ve been 
always very, very close to her. 
Q: And what is her full name? 

A: Her full name is Ella Fabian. And sh
e married a -- a -- ju
st about the only 
eligible Jewish boy who was 
left in Trencin after the Ho
locaust. He survived being 
put behind a false brick wall,
 and two bricks were removed from time to time to 
feed him and take the soil out. And he ne
ver regained his hea
lth, but she married 
him anyway, and they have two beautiful 
children. They are both medical docto rs 
and I visit them quite often. 
Q: And the grandparents you sp oke of, woul
d they have been your -- were they 
maternal? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076

A: Well, my maternal grandmother is a la
dy of particular distinction that I talk 
about very much. She was the local marriage broker. Di
d I ever tell the story about 
here? 
Q: No. I would love to know. 

A: Oh, Grandmother Emma was really some
thing very special. She was married to 
my matern al grandfather, Alexander Wein
er, who was a master cabinetmaker. It 
was apparently a deep love because during 
the first World War, when he went to 
war, and no, he didn™t write for a couple of
 years, everybody th
ought that he died, 
and she got very, very  sick. At any rate, 
meanwh ile she made a living by having a 

very small store sellin g embroi
dery. And this was embroide
ry patterns. So when the 
little girls had to come in to
 start working on their trousse
au, they had to come to 

Emma™s little shop an d she imprinted on th eir 
pieces of linen, patterns. And in  those 
days, my mother tells me, th
e girls had to start working 
on their trousseau at the age 
of five. I mean -- I me an, if you didn™
t get married by the 
time you were 19, you 
were really just not marriageable, or wa 
-- there was something 
wrong with you. At 
any rate, the girls started wo rkin g on a trou
sseau, and because the girls had to come 
in and do very complex em
broidery, my grandmother co
uld tell how intelligent the 
girl was, and how in dustrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for 
recommending somebody. So my  maternal
 grandmother, Emma, apparently was 
known very widely in the whole community as
 absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that -

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
7
- that never made a mistake.
 And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker, 
as well as a -- as a seller of embroidery. 
Q: So th is would be d
one quite formally. People 
would pay fo r her advice? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. Marriage brokers were 
paid, and of course the other thing was 
that my  grandfather Weiner made -- wa
s known fo r making chests which were 
inlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabi
netry. This was inlaid wood veneer. And so, 

usually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were 

starting to get on th e queue with  my  grandf
ather Alexander, to start making a chest. 
Well, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, 
and so the delivery on these chests was 
always uncertain. But he was a fun guy. He
 was always singing, he -- he -- he was 
really -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more 
c-care of me than anybody else in the 
family, because he had the time. And I was th en apprenticed to him at the age of 11, 
and he taught me how to do 
inlaid veneer. So 
I worked for him fo
r awhile. So it was 
a very colorful kind of an experience. 
Q: And very loving. 
A: Well, yes and no. My father was a 
very tense person. And -- and there was 
always a question -- course, I was -- I was 
a -- a child that caused trouble. I-I was 
known as the troublemaker. I-I had a reputa
tion as being a par
ticularly rebellious 
child. And years later some pe
ople tell me about kind of th
e pranks that I used to 
pull, and my  father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the line and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
8
very often I didn™t. But the rebellion was th
ere to begin with. My  mo ther was a very 
loving woman, but she was really the brai
ns behind the busin ess, we ran a big 
busin ess, my father had a big busine
ss. She was the cashi er. She was the 
peacemaker am-among the em
ployees. She was very char
itable. She was actually 
the head of the WIZO, whic
h was the women™s Zionist organization, in Trencin. 
Everybody loved her, a-although there 
were some women who wore a grudge 
against her because she stole the best ma
n in town. And i -- 
years later, a woman 
who surv ived told me that she could have
 been my mother. Sh
e was a -- she had her 
eye on -- on my father, ex
cept for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother. 
So that™s -- that™s -- these are the ki
nds of stories that one -- I remember. 
Q: What would be the kind of things th
at you would get up 
-- up to , and where did 
that rebelliousness come from, I wonder, in your case? 
A: Where does the rebelliousness come from,
 I don™t know. I was not considered  to 
be a bright child. I was not considered to
 be one of the leading scholars. I mean, 
there were kids who were -- had better grad
es than I did. I was always looking at 
things. I-I must say that one of
 the memories that I have wa
s that in the third grade -
- so I mu st have been eight years old, 
maybe less, I became very interested in 
condoms, which was a no-no th ing in  those da
ys. I mean, that was totally out of -- 
out of bound for ever
ybody. And I did not know exactly 
what it was, but I was told 
this is really hush-hush. Well, what happe
ned is that through some arrangements, I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
9
got hold of a pack and brought
 them to school. Now, th at was considered to be -- I 
was badly beaten up. You know -- in those 
days, you know, the kids got physical 
punishment. I had to stretch my  hands, an
d I got caned over my  hands. Now why I 
did it, I don™t know, but it should have sort
 of -- you know, I got a kick out of it. 
Particularly the -- the teacher, who was canin
g me, was an idiot. And he didn't hear 
well, he didn™t speak well, didn™t see well. He was in his last year before retirement, 
and I think I just had to get at him one
 way or another. So -- so, discipline was 
always a problem with -- with me, including 
so me really bad st-stunts that I pulled 
on girls, but it™s -- it™s history. 
Q: We™ll get to that. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Now, tell me the full names of your ma
ternal grandparents and then I™d like to 
ask about your other grandparents. 
A: Yeah, the maternal grandfather was Al
exander Weiner, my 
mother™s -- she was 
born Weiner, Frances Weiner. Her -- Alexan
der™s wife was Emma wa -- she died 
quite early, in the 30™s. An
d -- and they really mer --
 wro -- ma -- had a major 
imprint on -- on -- on my sensibility and u
nderstanding and -- and -- and -- and care. 
By the way, I just want yo
u to know i-is that Grandf
ather Weiner was a diabetic, 
which mean he had to eat early, and he 
-- he had to eat mo
re frequently than 
anybody else. He made a me an garlic soup.
 I mean, really strong garlic soup. To 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
10
this day, a garlic soup, to me, is the best
 soup you can eat. And my  whole family is 
still kidding me about the fact
 that I will eat anything as
 long as it has garlic. But 
it™s in me mory of my  grandfather. 
A: And your paternal grandparents? 

Q: Well, the paternal grandfather, Filip wa
s a sick man, he had angina. He was a 
very withdrawn kind of a person, never talk
ed too much. He was no fun. The -- the -
- he married a woman from a fa
mily that -- that had lots 
of aunts. Oh, it was a huge, 
huge family. And my  paternal grandfathe
r™s wife Anna was very small and she 
always liked to give me food that I didn
™t get at home. So her specialty was baked 
potatoes with lots of onions, garlic and wh en
 you render goose fat, the skin -- sh-she 

mixed that in. And so fo r years I ate on 
that and of course when I came home I 
didn™t have an appetite, for which I 
was always punished, of course.  
Q: By th e way, of your maternal grandf ather, does any of his furniture surviv e, do 

you know? 

A: I recognize some of his pieces in the ho
mes of the Gentiles that I visited after the 
war. They  vehemently desi 
-- [coughs] deny -- let me stop.
 [tape break]. You -- your 
question was about precious possessions. One 
of the things that I learned from the 
Holocaust is never to care for precious
 possessions. I can walk away from this 

house any time. 
Q: Yeah, because you™ve -- you -- you™
ve learned from those experiences. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
11
A: Yeah, what I learned from the experien
ce is that the ability 
to walk away from 
something is very important, it™s [indeciph
erable] survival. If th
ere is a major lesson 
I™ve learned from the Holocaust
, it is my ability to just
, when I see a problem, 
something going wrong, I just walk. And -- a
nd I would say that is a characteristic 
which is something very deeply  ingrained 
in my  behavior. And if there is a single 
pattern that describes what I learned from 
the Holocaust, is th
at ability to walk 
away. 

Q: We™ll come back to that later in  the in
terview, but because you™ve mentioned it, I 
will ask now about your decisi
on to leave your home in 1
948, when you, more than 
many others, had a reason to stay. You had a 
heritage and things you could pick up 
-- 

A: Property, yeah. We had a heri -- her
itage property. I could have inhe -- I -- 
presumably I was inheriting lots of land,
 houses. My decision 
to walk was much 
earlier than when people were
 forced out by th
e communists. I  -- al t h ough many of 
the Jews who came back, they were spe
nding their time reclaiming properties and 
going to court, and 
going through recovery and recl
amation and res
titution and all 
of this thing, I wanted no pa
rt of it. I didn™t -- never touched it in my years there. I 
basically felt that the -- 
the country was poisoned. Th
e people that I saw on the 
streets when I walked, were -- were the 
people who were killing and stealing and 
robbing and -- and -- and co mmitting crim
es, including the people who gradually 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
12
came to the forefront in a political pos
ition. These are people I knew from the 
uprising as criminals. You know, I said, I just
 don™t want to live in
 this country. Just 
don™t want to be there, regardless. So I to
ld  my  sister, you take everything is here -- 
by th e way, I never took a penny out of that place. Never took a penny, I™ve never 
claimed anything. I was never paid or made
 any claims to the Germans, although all 
the other Jews did. Never want
ed to touch it, that was tain
ted stuff. So this is -- this 
is a very important characteristic o f my e
xperience that -- that I did not cling -- I do 

not cling to things which are basically, 
in my view, morally 
evil. When you see 
anything that™s mo rally evil, 
wrong, you don™t stick around
. And -- and that is really 
the reason why, starting in 1946, the idea 
was, I™m not going to
 stick around, I™m 
just going to go wherever I can. Of course
, the idea was to go 
to America, where 
there was unlimited opportuni
ty  and nobody knew me.  
Q: Now, was it that clear cut in the beginn
ing? I mean, th -- all -- did you rationally 
think through th e pros and cons of leavi
ng everything and going with  nothing to  
America? 
A: Well, the big mo ment, the big mo ment
 in my  life, you know, in -- in other 
words, in -- when you look at
 life, there are only few th
ings which are so called, a 
fulcrum. And th is is when you roll your 
dice, and if you don™t roll the dice right, 
you die. It™s -- it™s -- y ou know, it™s -- it™s --
 or -- or perish, or whatever. When the -
- when th e uprising took place and -- and th
e Germans started persecuting Jews and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
13
partisans and arresting people, we went 
to predetermined houses where we wo -- 
you know, hide and we -- th
e Christians are going to  ke
ep us hidden and we were 
going to crawl into the attic, 
or crawl into a closet or -- or whatever. And, you 
know, these experiences, everybody has a diffe
rent experience about what they did. 
I went to the house, which you may or ma
y not recall from my interview, to the 
house of an employee who was a very trusted interview -- employee of -- of my 
father™s. A long employee wh
o owed very mu ch 
to my father. His wife was very 
unhappy, his wi -- by the way, th e marriag
e was a bad marriage to begin with. And 
she was grousing about, y-you -- you know
, the Germans coming, finding me there 
and shooting the whole family because they
 to -- that is what the Germans were 

advertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to
 be executed. So I -- 
I was told to just 
go out to the -- near the river, and sit th
ere during the day, wh en presumably the 
Germans were going to do house to house s
earches and then come back at night and 
they™re going to  feed me. And the big de
cision, this is one of these fulcrum 
decisions wh ich sort of imprinted me on 
my  who le mo del, wa
lking away. When I 
sat at the river, I said, I™m 
not going to  go back. I™m rather going to go take my  
chances where the shooting was 
than go back to what is 
presumably a safe house. 
Same thing happened  in ™48 -- or ™46, you 
know, I could have stayed  there, but this 

idea of walking was by that time very h
eavily imprinted in me
. Also, th-that my 
behavior in -- in the partisans was very 
mu ch  -- a-as you know, during th e partisan 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
14
warfare, there™s always a little cottage wh
ere you can go to and so me peasants will 
hide you or keep you for the night, so in
stead you being outside in the frost, you™re 
going to come into the village 
and stay there and get fed. We
ll, lots of partisans lost 
their life that way. I just didn™t do that. 
There was always a bunc
h of guys who say, 
well, it™s just too dangerous. So this idea 
of not necessarily staying comfortable, but 
doing th e contrary th ing is something which 
is not just Paul Strassmann, this is 
something, when  you look at history of 
Jews -- I™m just fini
shed reading for the 
second time Paul Johnson™s history of th -- 
of Jews. You know, when  you say, well 
how did the Jews survive for, you know, wh
atever thousand years it was, you know, 
how did they move from -- from S u mer to 
Egypt to Canaan to Assyria to Babylon 
and back and fo rth. And th en went to Persia
, then went to -- to 
-- to -- to Damascus 
and to An atolia. Th-T he -- the wandering Je
w. Well, the survival of the Jews was 
one that they  always were ready to move. 
They  would have stayed put, they would 
have died and perished like ev
erybody else who stayed  put. So th is is not just a Paul 
Strassmann kind of an imprint, it™s just 
deeply -- now whether it™s genetic, I doubt, 
but it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or re
ligious or psychological
 orientation. It™s 
something that -- that very 
mu ch has been a pattern of everything I™ve done and 
how I™ve progressed in the United States. 

Q: It could be, I suppose, this real surv
ival instinct. I had -- on the one hand, you 
could say that you™re -- certainly with 
the partisans you™re -- you seemed to have 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
15
nine lives. You were young, y
ou were taking risks, but it™
s an interesting to -- way 
to -- to look at it, that it 
was in your blood, that it™s 
part of the -- part of your 
heritage. And th ere does seem to be mo ra
l overtones, that rather than hiding, you 
were taking an active role that might make things better. 
A: Yeah, in fact my son that I lost was ve
ry much interested in
 the subject, and -- 
and he was a brilliant, brilliant scholar at Ha
rvard. And he always wanted to know, 
you know, what -- what make
s it tick? You know? Give me an equation, you know, 
give -- give me somethi
ng quantitative. Because you 
know, I always do things 
quantitatively. And I said, well, a-as yo
u know, in -- in games theory and in 
mathematics, and in gaming, there are th
ings called algorithms, okay? And so he 
wanted to know, what™s the algorithm. And anythi -- in conversation with my  son, 

then I said, you know, the -- 
the -- the algorithm in life is that you always want to 
migrate to where your number of options th
at you have, increase. So the algorithm 
is that if you are somewhere in wh at™s 
called a mathematical sack, cul-de-sac, 
you™re down  to one option. And so in gami
ng theory -- this is 
called option theory, 
by th e way, and by th e way Van Neuma
nn did a formal analysis of this 
[indecipherable] so -- 
so there™s a mathematical basi
s for it. In gaming theory  you 
have to lo ok always for space, for mo re 
options, even if it costs you mo re, because 
once you have more options, even if th
e price is higher, the probability of you 
possibly doing better is greater than if you 
are what™s called, in a zero sum game. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
16
Cul-de-sac, it™s called -- in -- in mathematic
s, by the way, this 
is called a knapsack. 
I mean, there is formal theo
ry over this thing. And 
my  -- my  second son Stev en, 
who has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., he -- he -- he™s
 a -- he™s a class one nerd, you know, 
mathematics, everything has to be qua
ntitative. You know, one day I just on a 
napkin, drew for him this whol
e theory of life, that life is
 really of maximizin g  your 
options. That™s what life is. In
 fact, when you 
look at the -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
A: Accord ing to  this theory  of option, it me
ans that if you stay hi
dden in a house of 
an employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are 
basically cooped  up and th ere™s no options
. I mean, you are just 
totally wedged in, 
and you have no place to go. When  you ar
e just in shorts, and with a t-shirt an d 
sandals, and one sandwich, in the reeds of 
the river Váh, and going back two miles 
is that house, or going forward, actually 
swimming down the river and th en going to  
the mountains where 
shooting takes place, th at™s
 mo re options. So you go. 
Q: Yes. Now you sp oke very critically of 
that wife and that being a bad marriage 
and -- in your earlier in terview. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: What -- did you know, in
 your community, mu ch about
 that woman? I assu me 
she could not be trusted, and you 
were at risk  in the household.

A: Well, about that wife I knew very little, 
ex cept that the a -- other employees were 
-- were always joshing this man, who was 
my father™s confidan
t, about this wife 
that he picked up. And I pick
ed up enough sort
 of, innuendo, to 
-- that my -- my -- 
my radar said, well there™s someth ing f-funn
y in here. Y-You must understand, in 
the back of my father™s store were, you 
know, were the merchandise and were the -- 
we loaded cars. There was lots of ro
ugh play and -- and -- and -- among the 
employees and of course I al
ways mixed around a
nd listened. And I picked up that 
this was one unhappy, henpecked  husband
. So  -- so, you know, but yo-you ju st 
factor that in -- into the equation. The fact
 that they didn™t want me to stay inside 
the house, and you know, th
is was only th e second day. I was there only one night. 
On th e second day, get out, you know, was 
enough of a signal that I would have no 
options at all because when  the Germans 
really started looking fo r people and doing 
house to house searches, I would have no place to go. 
Q: Let™s go back for a mo
ment, because we™ve jumped 
from your early childhood -- 
A: Yes, that™s right. 
Q: -- to this period when you w-were in hi
ding. And tell me a -- the context of what 
had taken place by then, and what 
had happened to your father. 
A: Well, the tragedy was -- is that the -- my
 father greatly mist
imed the whole issue 
of how we will survive. Ye -- we received, 
in 1942 at the end -- towards the end of 
the deportation, a presidential exception,
 which also covered the gran dparents.

Grandfather Weiner was sent to conc
entration camp, but it was the Slovak 
concen tration camp. The Slovak s kept some of the carpenters, and some of the 
Jewish craftsman to make furniture and ar
tifacts for the Slovak 
new powers. So they 
kept a camp where the Jews were slave labor
ers, but they did -- were not shipped to 
-- to -- to annihilation camps
. So Grandfather Alexander was in a place called 
Novaky. We were in Trencin. My fathe
r, because of his prior connection with  a 
very distinguish ed Catholic priest, by na
me of Bernetsky, really an outstanding 
friend of my father, secured a presidential protection, so that we were not deported 
in 1942. But we always knew that the da
y of reckoning will come when the front 
moves in from the east, and the Germans 
retreat. At that time, there will be 
wholesale destruction and a
nnihilation and mu rder and 
who knows what happens. 
And so, starting in ™43, we started  rehe
arsing where do we go, wh ere do we hide 
when the front moves. My father had se
t up a hiding place, and then  a fall-back 
hiding place and a third place. 
In other words, there were
 like three places to go to. 
When  the -- the beginning of the uprising,
 but it was not so full born yet, but when 
the guerilla attacks started -- it was prec
ipitated, by the way, by the -- by the 
communists, for reaso n s which -- that™s anot
her story. We decided to go to back-up 
place number one, which was in a town calle
d Selec, which is not too far from -- 
from Trencin, in the mounta
ins. Was a small peasant v
illage, there was peasant who 
was for money and my father already pr
ovided food an d what have you, we™re 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076

going to  go there. Well, when 
my father decided to -- to 
go to Selec, well then, there 
were other people who my father was obl
igated to. My father inherited from his 
partner, who I may or may not have mentio
ned, by name of Kubicek. Kubicek went 
to the Zionist congress in Basel in 1938 
and never came back. My  father took over 
custody of his wife and his son. So  -- and th
ere were two aunts, so my father took a 
truck from the busin ess, loaded ev erybody 
and in we go into Selec to hide. Of 
course, the whole village saw that here co
mes a whole bunch of Jews, you know. It 
was just not well thought out. So  we were
 there for two days, wh ich was, I think 
August 27 and 28 and my  father recognized 
this was really -- it was just too noisy, 
there were just too many people. And ev
erybody was in the sa
me place. So the 
decision was to go back to Tren cin and re
group and start going into  places where 
everybody will go in on
esies or twosies -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- to hiding places. Well, that night 
Gestapo came and took my father as a 
hostage, and my  gran dfather Weiner. And ju
st happens that that night I was not 
sleeping at home. Of course, we were, by th
at time, living in very, very low, low -- 
low kinds of housing, you kn
ow, housing that was very, 
very low grade. You know, 
it was out in the boonies. I think we had 
only one bedroom and one living ro om, so 
it was crowded an yway , so I st ayed with a friend. So in the morning I was told the 
family was taken, my father was take
n, and th erefore I should go now to  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
20
contingency place number three,
 which was the -- this em
ployee, so -- so within 
three days, we went from contingency one 
to contingency two, to cont-contingency 
three like this. And these -- so you were at 
the end of th e rope by that time. And it 
was still now only September one or Septembe
r two, 1944. So you were out of an -- 
a -- a rope, you™re at the end of the r ope now, already, and the -- you know, th e 
show only started, I 
mean the -- the bad times only star
ted now. So that th -- was the 
context under which I said, this is a bad 
option. I mean, I have no place to go.  
Q: And how old were you then ? 

A: 15. I was 15. I was a sturdy 15. Really
 experienced hiker. Because I couldn™t go 
to school at the age of 11, my father a
pprenticed me to my  grandfather. When  my  
grandfather was shipped to the labor camp,
 I was then apprentic
ed to work in a 
machine shop, which was a wonderful expe
rience. And in the machine shop we 

were fixing threshing machines. And i -- the 
-- in -- in those days they didn™t have 
ball bearings, so they had bushings made ou
t of copper, and wh en
 they didn™t oil it 
properly the copper melted, so you had to
 re -- ream the bushings, and I learned 

pouring, holding the mo ld when  people we
re pouring metal to 
make a bushing and 
then reaming it out and fitting axels into it.
 I -- the people in the machine shop were 
a bunch of real tough guys
, including one guy who was wounded in the Span ish 
Civil War, in a communist brigade. Wa
s a rough guy, and who subsequently 
became the commissar of one of the ba
ttalions and was guilty of enormous 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
21
atrocities. And after the war he became 
the deputy chairman
 of the communist 
party. And he was one of the guys why I d
ecided, with that guy around, I -- I don™t 
want to live in
 this town. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: That -- it was one 
-- one dangerous guy. 
Q: Yeah. Do you think your father, 
just as he took you on hikes -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- was also, in your apprenti
ceship in th e threshing shop -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- deliberately 
toughening you up? 
A: Oh yes. Oh my -- my father always
 -- of course my fa -- because of his 
background, believed in tough. You know
, physical, mental tough stuff. And of 
course, Hashomer Hatzair particularly emphasized that. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And of course the town I come from us
ed to be a garrison all the way going back 
to Roman times. Trencin was the last mountains -- mountain pass from the 

Carpathian mountains into the D-Danube 
[indecipherable] and the Romans were -- 
had their advance camp in there and on th
e castle, I will show the picture if you™re 
interested in. It was a huge, medieval castle
. And we used to, you know, at -- at -- at 
seven years old our favorite game was to 
go into the castle and play cops and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
22
robbers and Crusaders and particularly 
figuring out how to defeat the Turks, 
because the Turks used to co
me to Trencin and devastat
e the population, so -- so, 
you know, th-that environment 
was already that kind of a mental process. This was 
not a mamby-pamby kind of 
a protected environment. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And of course, starting in
 ™37 - ™38, we were badly 
beaten up by the hooligan s, 
as Jews, you know, so we had to  go in pack s on th e street.  
Q: But at the same time your father 
was also, with optimism, making sure you 
continued your studies, your 
pian o lessons and your tutoring. 
A: Oh yes, oh -- well, meanwhile, my fath
er, of course, paid for piano lessons, 
which we couldn™t affo rd, and for English,
 you know, I -- starting in ™38. But we 
always knew -- you know, my father™s idea
l life -- I mean, he alway -- was to move 
out of Slovakia -- Czechoslovakia, move to
 England, put his son in to an English 
school, and live in a setting like I live in
 right now. A gard
en and privacy and 
quietness. And th-that was his idea. My fath er™s idea of life was to live like an 
English gentleman, reading books and -- 
and -- and writing, and -- and -- and -- and 
-- and not -- not having to deal with this 
tremendous pressure, this enormous social 
pressure which existed in that place. 
Q: And of course you -- I-I was 
just thinking of the fact th
at your survival in that 
one instant, clearly rested 
on your father sending you away
 that night, to stay with 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
23
this former employee. I -- I m
ean that y-you were the only
 son, he seems in so many 
ways to have -- 
A: No, no, no, that night wh
en my father was taken by the Gestapo, I was with a 
friend who was not an employee, he was just a chi -- 

Q: Oh, that™s right. 
A: -- was a childhood friend, and we -- we 
were quite friendly with him. He was 
half Jewish. And th-the reason I stayed th
ere was that, you know, it was just I s -- I 
used to sleep around with friends, you kn
ow, we visiting back 
and forth, and it was 
late, there was curfew already and they 
said, well, why don™t you stay there. 
Q: Oh, so that was not a -- 

A: It was not a [indecipherable] 

Q: -- a kind of instinctive thing on your father™s part. 
A: No, it was not, it was -- it was just
 stupid luck. I mean, it was just -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- just luck.  
Q: Mm. Do you rememb er what -- what it was like, what you felt emotionally, 
knowing that your father had been taken? 

A: Well, in some respect it was a sense of
 betrayal, because I did not know -- see, 
nobody ever told me 
what the plan was. I did not ha
ve any money. I did not know 
what the financial arrangements were. See, 
part of the problem was that I was a big 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
24
blabber. And my father really didn™t shar
e too many things with me. So -- you see, 
the assumption was always that dad will take 
care of everybody. This idea that I, at 
the age of 15 would be independent, and ha
ve to make decisions on my  own, I don™t 
think that was on the agenda. See, the assumption always was, the father of the 
family will sort of direct ev
erybody and decide who goes wh
ere. And so part of this 
experience was that here I was with no cl
othing, just wo l -- told, why don™t you go 
to this house. No -- there was no questi
on of money, what th
e arrangements were, 
nothing. I didn™t know what the deal was. 
I di d not know where 
it leads, what was 
the further fall back, nothing. 
So  not knowing anything, I 
finally decided, well, you 
know, you either sit he re, go back and do 
what everybody else was doing, or just 
get -- get on with so mething. And I guess th
at was the -- the -- the decisive mo ment, 
because had I stayed, I would have been -- 
sure ended up in a concentration camp. 
They -- they would have surely found me and shipped me off.  

Q: Now the protection that your father 
had from -- was it Mons
ignor Be-Bernetsky? 
A: Yes. 
Q: How rare would that be? I know your
 father was prominent and successful - - 
A: It was quite rare, it was quite rare. It 
was quite rare, yeah, it 
-- it -- it was. It was 
-- well, you know, I can give you the num
bers, you know the numbers are that -- 
that there were 83,000 Jews in Slovakia
, 64,000 were shipped to an nihilation camp 
with nobody coming ever 
back. Of those who left, which was like 18,000, a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
25
number, maybe 4,000 went into  
slave labor camps to -- to work for the 
locals. Then 
whoever was left [sneezes] --
 excuse me -- either got false papers or sort of 
disappeared, or got legitimacy, and of -- got
 -- got papers, so-called white papers, 
and [indecipherable] and it -- it was a big deal. It was a big deal. 
Q: Would it have involved any assump tion of 
risk or danger for Bernetsky that he 
was -- 

A: Protecting. 

Q: -- protecting your father? 
A: Bernetsky was untouchable.
 He is considered toda
y a sort of, you know, the 
town square is named after 
him, a-a-and he -- he was 
close with Tiso, who was the 
president. The president of Slovakia could 
write an exception, you know, under his 
signature. For my father and 
the family to be protected required th e signature of the 
president of Slovakia.  
Q: And it seemed that you never had to 
pass as a non-Jew. Am I right in -- I -- I 
mean, al-always your community knew w
ho you were, and wh
o your fami ly 
members w ere, but from a bureaucratic point
 of view, you did th ings so that 
according to paperwork, your
 -- you™d be placed in the 
category that gave you a 
better chance for survival.  

A: Well, there was a few wrinkles with this
 thing. We had to get baptized, and the 
question was, well what™s the faster ways
 of getting baptized? Well, to become 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
26
baptized as a Catholic -- and Bern etsky o
ffered that, was a very comp licated thing, 
and you know, the timing was short. My 
father was very good friends also -- 
because my father was one of  the leading citizens in town
, with the senior -- the -- 
which he™s a sort of a -- like a auxiliary
 bishop, by name of Zimon, a wonderful 
scholar of the Lutheran church. And so  in 
1942, after a proper course in catech ism 
and so fo rth -- which I did very  well, by the way. Fran kly, I liked the catechism 

better than I liked the Jewi
sh stuff because I could understand it, you know, it was 

in Slovak and it was sort of interesting,
 historically. And -- you know, and Jesus 
was a Jew, so it must have 
been okay. And also
, the beautiful thin
g about the -- the 
Luth erans is th-the organ mu sic. You s
ee, the Jews didn™t have mu sic in the 
synagogue, only wailing, you know, the -- no
 music. The -- the Lutheran church had 

a wonderful organ an d then in
 the chapel they had a harmonium, which I used to 
like to play on. Bu t, you know, the -- th
e -- the s -- the psalms, you know, mo stly 
old -- this -- this was Lutheran of th
e Augsburg persuasion. I don™t know you 
understand the -- Lutherans -- 
Lutherans come in various flavors, you understand 
that? Okay. There was lots of Old Testamen
t songs, which have been  -- which have 
been -- which are sung, according to mu
sic [indecipherable] by Johann Sebastian 
Bach. And they™re beautiful, th
ey™re absolutely beautiful. 
So I had a great time with 
the Luth erans. Everybody knew, of course, 
that I was a baptized
 Jew. I mean, y-you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
27
know, in this little town, ev
erybody could tell that. But i -- you know, it was just -- 
just wonderful. 
Q: Yes. I -- I really just meant that
 distinction between 
those who hid their 
Jewishness, and y-you were r
eally, as a family , not doin
g that, but also assuming 
this membership in 
th e L u th eran  ch u r ch . 
A: Yeah, and a -- a -- yeah, we -- we were not hiding anything, there was no way of 

hiding it. I mean, everybody knew who s 
-- Adolf Strassman, my father was and 
who I am, but -- but i-it was a convenien
t way, and th e Luth erans who were a 
minority in the town sort of
 felt th at they were -- and 
the Luth erans never went in 
with this Nazi stuff anyway
. I mean, in the ar -- in th
e undergro und, mu ch of the 
pro-western connection -- i -- yi -- as 
you know th ere was a London underground 
and there was a Soviet underground. The 
-- the Soviet undergro und was a bunch of 
atheists and -- and -- and quasi-criminal 
element. The intellectual undergro und in 
London was mostly Lutheran
. And I turned out to be 
quite a scholar in -- in 
Luth eran affairs, and of course I went, 
you know, the catechis
m, an swered all the 
questions and -- and -- and -- y
ou know, I -- I did just fine. I enjoyed it. So -- so yi -
- y -- sort of everybody went along with this
 thing. It was a very interesting period. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I have only warmest memori
es on -- on that period. I me
an, in -- in the period of 
the war, which is 1942 to 1944, it prov
ided a period of relative stability.

Q: Does your story of what happened in 
th is case shed light on Madeline Albright™s 
family history, and the fact that, I think,
 she di -- she was not aware of her Jewish 
heritage -- 
A: Oh, balderdash -- 

Q: -- until a late si -- 
A: -- balderdash. I don™t believe that, but -- 
but if she was or she wasn™t, a -- I mean, 
there -- there was no point of hiding it, if 
-- I mean, these are sm
all circumstances, 
small town. Now she u -- if 
she came from a big town lik
e Prague, and I don™t know 
of the detail, it™s possible that the thing wa
s sort of expunged, but in a small town 
there was no way of forgetting who wa
s a Jew, and who wasn™t a Je w. 
Q: I just thought that -- that th -- the prac
tices and the things done to help s -- Jews 
survive in Czechoslovakia might differ from 
what was happening in other countries, 
and that therefore -- 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- her case -- that it shed some light on her story. 
A: Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I --I -- I™m sure of th
at and you know, that
 the conditions were 
different in Bulgaria. For instance, I -- I ha
ppened to be presiding last year at the 
Bulgarian memorial, and it was very inte
resting for me, th-that was a totally 
different approach  of solving th e situ
ation. The -- the -- you know, ge-getting a 
presidential except -- exception, the white pa
per, and by saying, well yeah, but that 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
29
you also converted to  Christianity, you kno
w, that was another check mark and that 
was okay. At least in ™42 it was -- you kno
w, in September of 1944, all the bets 
were off, I mean, none of that applied.  
Q: Mm-hm. But what was happening in y
our family™s story, wh ere your father 
previously seems to have been ma
sterfully studying strategies -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- is mo st interesting. I mean, yo-you 
suggest that with some forward thinking 
and astuteness, you could work  
the system, to some extent. 
A: That is correct, you could wo rk the sy
stem as long as options were available. 

Once the Germans took over, there were no 
options. I mean, they
 eliminated all 
options, I mean, there was -- y-ye -- if you we
re a Jew, baptized or otherwise, you 
know, your -- you were either shot or 
shipped to -- to concentration camp s. 
Q: Mm-hm. Now you were
 10 when the Germans oc
cupied Czechoslovakia? 

A: No, th-the Germans did not occupy Cz
echoslovakia. The Germ
ans occupied only 
the Czech Republic and they
 created what™s called the Protectorat. They did not 
occupy Slovakia. They made a deal withMonsignor Tiso to create a Slovak state, 

because they just had their 
hands full, and th-they wanted
 to draw on the military 
capability of Slovakia, which was quite 
considerable. Slovaki
a ultimately put up 
92,000 soldiers working for the Germans,
 fig h ting with the Germans against the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
30
Soviets. So the Slovak, two divisions went 
into Russia, advancing all the way to the 
Caucasian mountains. 
Q: But it was -- it was that -- well, really
 my  question is, your life would chan ge 
dramatically when you were 10, am I right? 

A: Yes, yeah, life changed dramatically becau
se the Aryan laws were put into effect 
by th e Slovak legislature, following the sc
ript, the German script, and that means 
Jews were stripped, in a very methodical 
way of all property, all privileges. And it 
was a bureaucratically highly organized pr
ocess of taking property aw ay. The -- it 
was very important that the various people
 who owed their loyalty to the Nazis and 
to the Slovak, were getting as mu ch propert
y as possible. So it started as a way of 
stripping the Jews of property, shipping 
mo st of the Jews, like 85 percent of the 
Jews into annihilation camps, and then whoe
ver was left, depriving them of all the 
civil rights and -- and property and radios 
and fur coats and -- and automobiles, and 
-- and -- you know, th-there was a long list,
 I still have those lists of what you can 
or cannot do, and wh at street you can be 
on, what is your cu
rfew, whether you can 
have a window looking at the street, or 
not looking at the street. I me an it was a 
very elaborate, bureaucratic structure that 
got erected to do th is. And, you know, as 
time went on, you know, things got closed
 down. The synagogu
e got closed down, 
the Jewish school got closed down . Go ing 
to a movie got closed down and so fo rth 
and so forth. And it -- it was -- th ere was -- it was always a next step. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
31
Q: And when you were livi
ng in poor quarters -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- in what you describe as a shack, but
 it -- it would be a couple of room, that 
would have happened  within th e 
space of a couple of years? 
A: Oh yes. First we had a beautiful hous
e that my father bu
ilt in 1933, which was 
on top of the store on the main, commercial 
streets. So, immediately  we could not 
live in the rooms which were facing the street. That was -- immediately we were 

pushed down in to the two rooms which were
 behind, not looking over the street. So 
that went on for about eight month or so
. Then came an ordinance that you cannot 
live on that street altogether. So then we mo ved to another apartment, a one 

bedroom ap artment. It was a very small 
living room, an upstairs walk-up, not too 
far from our original house. And we we
re there for maybe a year. Then an 
ordinance was passed that yo
u cannot be ev en there, 
because it was ho -- it had hot 
and co ld water. Jews cannot 
be in any ap artment where th ere is both hot water and 
cold water. So we had to find a place 
which was really, you 
know, a slum, beca --

Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Mu

is an interview with Paul Strassmann, co

th
, 2004, in New Canaan, Conn

Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview

interview to a USHMM videotaped interv
iew conducted with Paul Strassmann on 
July the 11

t Memorial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making th
is interview possible. This is tape 
number two, side A. Did you ever go 
back  and look at your old home? 
A: We -- I surely did. I -- my  father™s hous
e on th e main street, when I finished my  
officer course in 1945, in 
a military uniform and with a 
Tommy gun, I just walked 
in at two o™clock in the mo rning, banged at
 the door. And of course it was occupied 
by th e people who to ok over my  father™s busin
ess. They were abso
lutely petrified, 
you know, it was immediately after the wa
r, and I was basically a p o litical officer. 
You -- you mu st understand that when  I got out
 of the partisans, I was considered to 
be an exceptionally reliable person to be 
used for whatever pur
pose, such as eth -- 
ethnic cleansing, you know, I was ready to do
 anything. And so I went back as soon 
as I could to find out if anybody was alive 
and of course they were petrified, they 
immediately moved out of the front -- front 
rooms of the house, to the back, wh ere 
we used to live. And I stayed there one ni
ght. I wa-wanted no part of it, I found out

33
nobody knew about anything ab out my  fami
ly. All they knew th
at my  mo th er was 
found shortly after she went into  hiding 
and that nobody knew wh ere my  sister was, 
and ev erybody knew that my  
father was shipped to concentration camp  right away. 
So -- so that was in ™45, I immediately 
went there. Since then a v -- you know, 
under the co mmunists, I couldn™t go back
. The -- it was shut down in  1948, when 
the communists took over. First time I went
 back to Tren cin was in -- maybe in 
1978 or ™79. By that time the house wa
s razed and a huge monster comp lex was 
built up as -- for Soviet kind of apartments
. B u t I go there now at least once a year, 
sometimes twice a year. I just
 finished a very major project in Trencin, which may 
be of interest to you. When I went ther
e in 1986, I went finally to the synagogue, 
which of course was converted in to some kind of a mu sic hall, but next to the 
synagogue was a small chapel, 
and everything was piled in, 
what that was left from 
the synagogue into  the chapel. It was a 
warehou -- i-it was a ma -- badly messed up 
closet, that™s all it was, the benches we
re stacked up. And on the wall were the 
names of the Jews that perish
ed. 1536 names.  And they we
re just printed on pieces 
of paper that was curling and getting mild
ew. And there on th e spot I decided that 
that is not going to be. And after four 
years of work, an d getting people from all 
over the world to cooperate, last y ear we
 unveiled 24 bronze tablets with the names. 
I paid for it, just about all of it. And it 
is now a sanctuary. So
 I™ve been back -- I 
mean, this idea of getting that memorial up in
to the -- into that chapel was very time 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
34
consuming. I mu st have made like 10 trips 
negotiating with various people. See, the 
Jews didn™t want to have any 
part of it. They didn't  want
 to stir trouble. So -- but 
finally I -- y-you know, it got very comp li
cated. Nobody wanted  
any part of it, you 
know, why do you want to stir thi
ngs up? Well, I stir things up. 
Q: Would there be repercussions fo 
-- th-that the Jews would suffer f-f --  
A: The few Jews, and I think there are eight 
or nine, that™s all there is, and they™re 
all in their 80™s like my siste
r, want to be left alone, peaceful. They don™t want to be 
bothered. They don™t want to 
be called Jew, or anything. So
 their idea is to lay low, 
and if there™s one thing this guy doesn™t
 do, it™s lay low, you know? So  -- but 
ultimately, people came from Israel, 
and from Germany and Switzerland and 
England for the unveiling. I think they we
re more interested 
in talking to one 
another who surviv ed, because they  grew up
 all together. These are the survivors. 
They™re looking at the memori
al, but that™s okay, that me
morial is go -- it™s -- it™s -- 
it™s -- it™s -- it™s wedged into 
the wall with deep rivets. Th
 -- it™s -- it™s heavy metal, 
like this. So it™s fairly indestructible, I 
mean, you would -- rea
lly would have to 
blow it up. And I just feel good about 
it, and to hell with everybody else. 
Q: And there had been Jews 
a -- I understandin Trencin 
since -- I as -- somewhere I 
saw that first records were of
 1760, perhaps before that. 
A: Oh, Jews have been in Trencin, you kno
w, I mean for -- the 
records go back to 
about the 11
th
 century, because you see, Trencin 
was always a military town, it was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
35
a base. It was always a government town , it was a trading to wn . And so  Jewish 
traders came and gone. That™s why you have 
those large co -- concen tration of Jews 
in Trencin. Because the Jews were basica
lly the lawyers and th
e record keepers and 
the -- the -- the Hungarian andAustro-Hungarian nobility us
ed Jews as their record 
keepers, as their bookkeeper
s. See, the [indecipherable] never wanted to be tainted 
by anything commercial. So they -- and they 
actually, as you know the history, they 
invited the Jews to come in to help th
em to manage Poland and -- and many of 
those countries, because the 
Jews were totally depend
ent on the nobility. And so 
there was a very large Jewish
 population and the Jews we
re being used as a mo ney 
gatherer because the Jews really were, 
until about 1860 could no
t own land. So the 
Jews were used as instrument of feuda
l oppression and tax collection, which of 
course was one of the sources of anti-Sem
itism, which was deeply endemic in that 
part, particularly among th e peasantry. 
Q: Now, you talk in your earlier in tervie
w about anti-Semitism being essentially an 
urban phenomenon. 
A: Yes, well because the Jews were urban.  
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah, yeah. The jur -- the Jew s were, of 
course, here and there, sitting in the -- in 
the properties, where they 
were maintaining property, and th ey were innkeep ers. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
36
But that was p -- all part of the taxa
tion mechanism that the feudal regime 
maintained. See, the feudal lords, they don™t want 
to mess around with that. 
Q: Now, I™m -- I™m going back again, 
but from whom would you have learned 
about what happened
 to your father, and when w
ould you know that he™d been  
taken to Sachsenhausen and tortured? 
A: I knew it from secondhand, of his tort
uring, because when  I got back into  
Trencin as a political officer, I was hell be
nt to even some scores. A nd we were 
interrogating a numb er of people, and I j-
just found out what
 happened, because 
everybody was saying, well it wasn™t me. It 
turned out that the 
Slovaks, jointly with 
the local Germans went -- and they had a lis
t of hostages that they wanted to  pick 
up, people who were suspect 
as working with the partis
ans, you see, because my  
father managed the food business, even und
er the Slovak regime. My father made 
sure that some food got moved into  the v
illages. So my father was on the list for a 
collaborator. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So that you -- you learned that later on.
 Now, y -- t-to what extent did you settle 
scores? I th ink you make some reference to 
ugly times, or whatev
er, initially after -- 
A: I -- well -- le-let me -- le-let me say, lo
oking back at it, I really didn™t settle an y 
scores. I really did not kill an
ybody. There were some people
 that I testified against, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
37
because of some of the acts 
that th ey committed
, but they were let go anyway, so -- 
so there was no scores to settle.  
Q: Again I want to go back to ask you abou
t th-the fact that your family did not 
leave in 1938, when  th-they 
had made preparations to es
cape. And you tell the story 
in your earlier interview about 
your mother as treasurer -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- hiding money an d then it got damaged by a steam radiator. 

A: Yes. 
Q: But it -- it seemed to me that your 
father™s family responsibilities weighed 
heavily on him. 
A: Abso lutely. 

Q: And did he ever speak about -- with regr
et about not going, or -- ju -- I™d just like 
to know more about that. 

A: Yeah. Th -- as I noted before, during the 
bad years, which is ™39 thro ugh ™44, the 
parents really didn™t speak mu
ch. They -- they -- 
they felt that -- th
at -- that I was a 
poten tial source of -- of leaks. Of course, my
 sister subsequently told  me that she 
also did not know what was going on. I thi
nk it was just the way my  father and my  
mother operated is they -- th
ey wanted to keep everythi
ng very tight. Also, in those 
days you did not speak to your children as 
peers. It was a different social structure. 
Children were there to be told
 what to do, to be educated
, to be trained. And -- and -

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
38
- and you had obligations, it was almo st a fe
udal kind of a relationship. It™s not the 
American way, you know, wh ere -- you know
, the conversation between the father 
and the mother and the children is fairly free,
 at least in my fam
ily. So we -- we just 
didn™t know. We didn't know their thoughts.  
Q: Mm-hm. But have you put 
yourself in your father™s shoes, and it does seem to 
me that the reason he chose not to leave 
with his immediate family was because of 
that responsibility to th
e extended family -- 
A: Oh yes. Well, yes, clearly, the re
sponsible for the extended family and 
particularly to his parents, he was very 
devoted to his father. 
He went and visited 
his father every night. And th -- he coul
d not get his father out. I me an, we had 
passports. You mu st understand. In 1938, my
 father, my mother, 
my  sister and I had 
pass -- valid passports. We could 
have walk ed  out any time.  
Q: Did your parents ever regret this, do you  think? Or was it an unspoken regret, if 
that was there. 

A: It was unspoken, it was never discussed.
 They  never discusse
d, you know, what 
could have happened , or wh at didn™t happ
en . That was never discussed, not to my  
best knowledge, and neither to my sister™s
 knowledge, who was older and sh e says 
she didn™t know. She 
just didn™t know. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
39
Q: Mm. And I assume that 
this would be what would 
happen in so  many families 
where it would be possible for some memb ers 
to leave, but it™s ve
ry hard to leave 
close relatives behind.  
A: Well, yes. I -- I would say that -- that
 the fir-fir-first -- ev
erybody always said 
that nobody expected
 it to be so bad. There was 
this old pattern, well somehow 
we™re going to mu -- muddle thro ugh. You 
know, this also w
ill come to pass. I 
don™t know if you™ve seen the movie, ﬁThe
 Pianistﬂ. You rememb er the early scene 

-- by the way, I only saw the first eight minu
tes of the thing, and then I wa -- got 
sick. There they are, ready to move out and leave Warsaw, and they hear on the 

radio, Churchill announces that England a
nd France is going ag-against -- in war 

against the Germans and they all have a 
big party because all their problems are 
solved. You remember that 
scene? Well, that scene was 
repeated again and ag ain 
and again. This is denial. The -- the -- mu
ch of the existence in those days was 
denial. People were denial -- were in deni
al all the way to the entrance of the gas 

chambers, and even then 
they were in denial. 
Q: Why do you think th at was 
so? Is that human nature? 
A: Well, I don™t know about what is hum
an nature, but -- but a-a-as you know, 
when you have no option -- th
is goes back to my options
 theory, okay, if you have 
no option, if you are -- if you have only on
e option, and th at™s all you have, the only 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
40
thing you can do about it, if
 it™s a horrible option, is to
 deny it. You don™t want to 
face up to it. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: See, the mo ment you have options, you 
cannot do denial be
cause you then  have 
to confront -- you know, of the three or f
our things that I can do, which one will I 
do? Then  you have to  go in to 
so -- irrational process. So if you are pretty well set in 
a given groove, denial will be the most natura
l way to try to deal with it, other than 
committing suicide. 
Q: And it helps to protect your ch
ildren, and your spouse, and -- 
A: Yes, yes, yeah. 
Q: -- and so on. Tell me what happened to  
your mo th er and your sister after your 
father was taken. 
A: Well, Mother went into a place for 
hiding, you know, she 
-- she already knew 
this was fallback number three, she went
 there. My sister  
didn™t like fallback 
number three, but she had false papers, so 
she went and took a train and went to 
Bratislava, where sheworked 
as a servant. My mother 
was betrayed in 30 days. 
Somebody said, well there is a 
Jewess in this house. Most likely, of course, it was 
given that she was betrayed by th e people
 who were keeping her. My sister was 
picked up on the street, 
somebody recognized her. And 
my  mo ther was shipped to  
Ravensbrück and so was my  sister. My sist
er barely made it, I mean  she was this 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
41
close. She -- she then did th
e forced march. M-My moth
er died of typhoid. My 
sister was very sick and she was on th
is forced march and they were shooting 
anybody who was a straggler, 
and she just fell down and two of her friends picked 
her up and walked her. Th
at™s how she 
survived.  
Q: Has she ever been interviewed by the -- 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: -- Holocaust -- oh. 

A: Yeah, I have a ca -- I have a copy of her ta
-tape. It is a very guarded description. 
She -- she censors her feelings
 very much. I mean, she -- 
she just feels that -- that 
she was left really helpless. And very much
 alone. And really did not know what to 
do.  

Q: That sounds much lik
e your feelings, initially. 
A: Initially. But she had no -- no -- she had no
 place to go. She just went to another 
town . And once you were in another town 
an d you were moving
 up in an open, 
sooner or later they™re going to  get you. 
Q: I wonder if you feel, or 
you have any memo ry of wh
en you were on your own, 
whether you have any sense that you clung
 to f-fond memories of childhood, and 
did they  wa -- ho -- wa -- did that give you 
strength to keep going? As an observer it 
would seem to me th at -- that start that you
 had in life, of security and a -- and an 
extended family, a really stable, good backgr
ound would give you reserves, sort of 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
42
inner reserves that might he
lp you to keep going, but 
do you -- do you consciously  
have any thoughts? Do you rememb er 
having memories of family times? 
A: Le-Let me sa -- tell you very, very 
clearly on this one. 
None. The -- the -- the 
conditions were so brutal and so difficult, 
that just coping with the here and now, 
and what do next totally occupied me. 
There was no -- looking back would be -- 
have been a weakness. So if
 you™re totally occupied with
 trying to  make the next 
step, the -- you know, the next 
sortie, the next raid, the next piece of clothing that 
you need because winter is comin g . The -- 
the -- the -- the -- the -- the struggle for 

survival in -- on a very brutal military co
nditions was so extreme that looking back 
was really not very useful. 
And -- and I usually don™t look
 back. It was interesting, 
about two days ago I had a conversation w
ith my  daughter. She had a contract that 
expired early in 2003, and the people paid
 her for awhile, and then  she protested 
and so th ey finally gave her a new contract
. And th -- it™s a nice contract, it™s a th ree 
year contract. The question was, they didn
™t pay her for about four month and there 
was a back pay issue. And her husband scre
amed at her that sh
e should not sign a 
contract because th-they owe her back pay. 
I say, forget about it.
 Forget about back 
pay, you know. It™s gone, y
ou know? Look forward, they™re
 giving you a good deal 
for the next three years. Take it and run. 
Q: Move on. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
43
A: Move on. So  this idea of mo ve on and 
the -- the -- the -- that is the only thing 
that -- that -- that is important. Except wh
en it comes so mething very close, like the 
death of my  son. That you -- that™s somethi
ng that -- that sort of looms because that 
is a d-deep wound. Bu t, you know, whethe
r you had a nice hous
e, and nice clothing 
and nice this and tha -- that™s -- that™s -- 
doesn™t matter. T h at™s the -- that™s easy. 

That™s -- you can walk away from there. 
For instance, during the Cuban crisis, I 
picked up my  children and moved them 
out to upstate New 
York. You know, we 
had a nice house in Mo unt Vern on, so wh
at? I mean, I mean, this means nothing. 
Q: Trappings. 
A: Yeah, it™s all trappings. 

Q: Yes. Well, you moved on. I-In -- wa
s it 1948 when  you came to the United 
States? 
A: Yes, yes, October in  1948. 
Q: Yeah. And you™d been, of course, 
a remarkably  young, noncommissioned 

officer, looking like a young boy 
in uniform, it seems to me. 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: You were a young boy. 

A: Oh, sure. 

Q: But you -- tell me about your -- your plan
s to come -- I think your goal was, 
from early on, to come 
to the United States. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
44
A: Yeah, and get an educatio
n. I mean, the important thing in life is to get an 
education, get a wife, and ha
ve a house, and live as clos
ely as your father talked 
about, namely live somewher
e with a garden, and -- and have children and -- and -- 
and have peace and quiet. You 
know. It™s that simple. 
Q: And your -- w -- t-tell me about your -- th
-the -- the logistics of how you came to 
the United States. 
A: Okay, the logis -- the logistics was th
at I knew the communists would be taking 
over, because they actually came o v er a
nd said , you know, St
rassman, you™re a 
hero, but you are the son of a capitalist. W
ould you do us a favor and just go? So , a 
very close, wonderful friend of my fathe
r, who was if so -- so -- who was a brother-

in-law of the man who went to Basel -- you 
know, my  father took care of a mo ther 

and a child. 
Q: Yes.  
A: So th ey went to Americ
a right away because he was 
an American citizen, so he 
could get his wife and his son to Amer
ica right away . I, of course, was not a 
relative, but he issued an affidavit fo
r me and put me on the immigration waiting 
list. My immigration visa hadn™t come through
 in ™47, or even ™48, but the brother-
in-law of this man who was in Ameri
ca, a very wonderful guy, said, look 
Strassmann, you better get out. You better ge
t out while the getting is good. So he 
found a school in England which was teach
ing electronics, who signed me up fo r a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
45
course. And with th at course and the fact 
that I™d all kinds of certificates and what 
have you, plus the fact that
 I paid 50,000 dollars for a passport, I was able to leave 
Slovakia with a -- one suitcase and no mo
ney, on February the seventh, of 1948. 
The co mm unists took over on February  the 15
th
, and shut the place down.  
Q: Just in time.  
A: I went -- and I went to -- to Paris wher
e this man, his name is Freddie Kobler, 
came from London 
to Paris to pick me up, he 
was waiting for me at the North 
Station as I came from the 
train, and he looked at me
 and said, boy do you look 
bedraggled , I -- ya -- you know, you -- you -- I 
-- I have to take you out into  a real 
restaurant. And so he took me
 out to a three star restaurant and served me a steak. I 
got promptly  sick. He couldn™t -- I couldn™t 
si -- you know. I cried when he -- when 
the steak came on my plate, I said , oh this 
is a ration for a whole family for a month, 
I cannot eat that. And then in th e evening 
he took me to Folies Bergère where I saw 
for the first time a naked wo man, which y
ou know, in -- in those days, you know, 
ma -- ma -- that was very puritanical. A
nd then I came to England and I went to 
school in England, getting my  Englis
h fixed up, and I was in England from 
February 1948 until early in
 October 1948 when a Libe
rty ship w-was returning 
empty from Plymouth to  New York . And I 
got, for 83.50, a fare on an empty -- in 
the hold of a Liberty ship. I just want you
 to know, the real Americans all came 
from Plymouth, you know.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
46
Q: Yes. Now, are the -- 
A: And so I arrived in -- in -- in Brookl
yn. M-My father™s friend picked me up at 
the dock in Brooklyn a
nd brought me to a house in Fore
st Hills, and I decided that I 
have to start my career in America, so 
I found a job in -- in Thanksgiving -- for 
Thanksgiving at -- in the Gertz Departme
nt store in Jamaica, New York, selling 
socks. And I sold the 
socks from Thanksgiving right thro ugh Ch ristmas. 
Q: Let me go back. The passp
ort that you left with -- 
A: Wasn™t --  

Q: -- when had the money been
 paid for that? Wh
en did you obtain that? Was it the 
passport you had earlier, or is it a new one? 
A: No. I had only one -- one Czechoslovak 
passport, which I obtained in January, 
late in January of 1948, and I obtained 
it by paying a lawyer, basically 50,000 
dollars, who then went around -- you couldn
™t get the passport any other way except 
paying a lawyer who then went and paid
 off the various bureaucrats and got a 
passport. The passport was not valid to go to
 America, w as just to go to England to 
school.  
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: And that would be th -- the money wa
s going to so meone, it was essentially a 
bribe? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
47
A: Oh yes, of course. 
Q: And how would you access the funds?
 I mean, presumably this was -- 
A: Well, I was still in Slovakia. 
Q: Yes, and -- 

A: And -- and, you know, my  sister 
had money from the store. I mean -- 
Q: Well -- 

A: -- my  sister took over the store I mean 
wa -- she got back the property. Sh -She 
married her sweetheart, who was sick. Bu
t she was in the store, and there was 
money. And I said, well 
give me 50,000 th en. 
Q: Yes. 
A: This was in kraus, this was not in dollars. 

Q: Now your sister co uld have left, but she was -- 
A: Oh, yes. 
Q: -- dedicated to her sick husband? 

A: Well that, and the property. There was 
lots of property and she, you know, 
claimed the property and as
ked for the restitu tion of the property and there was a 
big store, there were fields, there were -- 
all the uncles were killed, so they had 
property. So I said, take the whole thing. 
Q: Mm-hm. Now -- I™m jumping 
back to the Liberty ship. 
A: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
48
Q: How long would it take you to  
travel across the Atlantic, and -- 
A: 13 days. Liberty ship  from Plymouth to
 Brooklyn was 13 days. It™s the same 
thing that it took prior year
s -- I mean, those Liberty sh
ips were leaking. I mean, 
they were riding high, th-they -- you 
know, they were coming back empty. 
Q: Tell me -- explain the -- explain wh at a Li
berty ship  was, and then I also want to 
know who else was on board . 
A: What is a Liberty ship? During World 
War II, we needed a great deal of shipping 

cap-capacity to ship th
e soldiers, both first to -- to Eu
rope and then to Atlantic. So 
there was a man by the name of Henry Kais
er, who used to make automobiles, who 

set up two assemb ly lines of making sh ips.
 They were called Liberty ships, they 

were sort of tack welded together. He ma
de one ship ev ery two 
days. And they were 
sort of tacky, and against all the code 
violations and what have you, but they  
brought the troops back and forth, br
ought them home. You know, the -- the 
Germans sank a few, but not too many. They
 went -- used to go in big convoys. 
And then in 1946, the relief for Europe, mu
ch of the grain went in Liberty ships. 
But by ™48 those ships were just
 too small for that sort of 
thing, so they retired them 
down in the James River. I m
ean, there were -- I used to
 fly over the James River, 
there used to be couple of hundred Li
berty ship s tied up in  James River. I say, 
which one did I come in on? They were a
ll the same. S o  that was li -- li -- a L iberty 
ship. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
49
A: Yeah. Who else was on board? And -- a
nd I™m also interested in knowing what 
was in that suitcase? You had -- have
 very few possessions then, but -- 
Q: Oh yes. What was in the suitcase was an
 -- a small accordion. In fact, my -- the 
first money I ever made was playing accord
ion and I actually arrived in the United 
States with 20 dollars that I made on the sh
ip. The -- most of th
e people on th e ship 
were a bunch of hippies. I mean, ther
e was no -- not too many immi grants -- or 
emigrants from Euro pe, you know, becaus
e the visas were very hard to get, 
particularly immigration. But starting in ™4
6 and ™47, lo ts of American college kids 
used to just go to Europe 
to -- just to see Europe, fo
r whatever reasons. And that 
was the cheapest way how to get back. An
d many of them subsequently became 
quite famous. For instance, on the ship
 was Leonard Ro se, who subsequently 
became a very famous cellist. But th -- it 
was mostly a student
 and young kind of 
adventure, non-confor
mist young people wh o used that
 as the cheapest way to get 
back to the United States. 

Q: Now, at the end of your time as a pa
rtisan  and then in the Czech army -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you were emaciated. 
I wondered if, by the time that
 you sailed to America, 
you had gained weight a
nd were pretty much rest
ored to good health? 
A: Well, you have to listen to my wife. 
My wife -- I -- I had 
a bad stomach until I 
married her. In other words, you know, 
I married her in 1954, but I had y-you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
50
know, th-the places where I used to eat. An
d the kind of diet I maintained and the 
kind of schedule I maintained. So I had 
a very -- I never recovered until I married 
her, and then she started f
eeding me what she calls in a -- not very  well seasoned 
hospital food. She™s -- she -- she still just
 believes in boiled chicken and boiled 
potatoes and -- and -- and not -- not -- none 
of the fancy fo od. I love the spiced, 
fancy stuff. She doesn™t feed me any of that
. So I wa -- my -- my real health did not 
recover until -- until married times. 
Q: Yeah. You -- you spoke about the fact 
that you™re -- in 
your teenage years, 
despite all the deprivations, you™ve -- you felt as if your family was -- despite the 

hardships, maintaining a sembla nce of n-normal life with -- 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- n-no feeling that there was no food and 
so on, but in fact, your diet must have 
been very restricted. 

A: Well, dur -- in -- fro m there -- from 1942
 through 1944, you kn
ow, diet was very 
limited, it was wartimes. On the other ha
nd, my  mo ther knew so many people and 
they brought us fruit and they
 brought us things that ot
herwise were not available. 
Once in awhile we had a chicken. But we
 only had meat once -- once a week. Most 
of the time we had dumplings, or ya -- 
you know, sour cream with potatoes and 
stuff like -- which was fine. I mean, I 
never felt deprived . I was never hungry. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
51
Q: Mm-hm. Clever ma nagement. Do you ha
ve any -- I mean, did you have any long 
term health  problems that resulted fro
m your hardships during World War II? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, I -- I ha
d bleeding pleur -- pleurisy. So , wh en I came out of the 
partisans, which was on March 25, 1945, I 
was immediately shipped to the hospital 
and declared unfit for military
 duty. So they sh ipped me 
to a very good sanitorium. 
And -- and -- and you know, th-they started 
feeding me. I -- I-I -- really, I had good 
food. And after three weeks I was declared to
 be totally fit to go and kill some more 
Germans. [laughs]. So -- so th
ey shipped me out of the sanitorium and th at was that. 
But -- but m -- you know, always had problems
 with stomach. And of course then, 
in the summer of 1945, I had a relapse and 
I was again shipped to a sanitorium, but 
that was on my  own money. And I think 
during th e mo nth of August of 1945, I was 
bedridden for about a month, but
 ri -- I was fine after that. 
Q: So there, not surprisingly were a
ffects of that kind of existence. 
A: Well, actually, the most serious dis
ease I ever had was -- I -- I d on™t think I 
mentioned it, but in 1949, I went to Co op
er Union, the ci-civil engineering course, 
you know th e story how I got 
in to that -- that -- that school, wonderful school. And 
in the -- the summer of 
1950, after having a course in 
surv eying, I volunteered to go 
to Israel to do su rvey ing of Arab  lands, 
subdivide Arab  lands, f -- you know, for the 
new jew -- Jewish settlements. And made 
a load -- loads of money, I mean -- I 
mean, they really paid well. I didn™t know
, wh en they  told  me to go and how mu ch 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
52
they will pay me, that this 
actually involved getting shot
 at, because you see, the 
surveyors is the first thing you kill. You 
-- you -- you understand, you always take a 
shot at the surveyors. But 
the problem was that toward s the end, and I, against any 
advice, drank from an Arab 
well, water, because I was so thirsty. And I came in 
with a horrible case of dysentery that lasted
 for about a year. I was sick a year af-
after that. But what the hell. 
Q: Now, tell me about meeting your wife. 

A: Oh, Mona, Mona was upstairs in the art 
school. The art school of Co oper Union. 
The engineers were very busy, I don™t -- y
ou know, I was the class president, I was 
editor of this or that, a ch
airman of the judiciary and 
what have you. And self-
supporting, so I also had a job, Thursd ay, 
Friday nights and all day Saturday  as a 
draftsman, so that I -- I was making a de
cent living. Decent living, sure, you know, 
2,000 dollars a year was really all you ne
eded the -- in those days. All -- you know, 
all you ate was potato chips and rotisserie ch
icken that you bought in a supermarket, 
and you know, perfectly good
 food, plus some Twinkies, you know? That -- that 
can last very well. And there was this girl
 in -- in Cooper Union I had my eye on. 
She was really a beauty, I me
an, really beauti -- her hair, 
she had a braid all the way 
down to her waist. She looked
 very traditional, she wore 
a dress up to her s -- to her 
-- to her neck, you know? And she was -- 
what -- five years younger, and she was 
very subdued, you know, sort of -- you kno
w the other girls in the art school were 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
53
sort of wild. There was lots of girls.
 I-I was the -- the bi
g man on campus, you 
know, as the chairman of th
is and that. She was one of 
the girls who were -- really 
did not come on, you know? So sh e was in
teresting. On gradua
tion day, 1953, us 
engineers, who really didn™t have time 
for anything because th -- you know, it was 
much more convenient
 for a date to go upstairs th
an to go scurrying around the 
town. We went upstairs and we inv
ited so me of the girls from the art 
[indecipherable] to go to -- for hot dogs 
at Coney Island. You know, it -- that was 
the big th ing. So  this whole bunch of gi
rls from the art school -- it was one s -- one 
class below our class. I was al -- o h  -- beca
use of my military, I 
was older than  my  -
- my  -- my  -- the other guys in this school
. We went to Coney Island and somehow 
they put her next to me on the roller coas
ter. Now, have you ev
er been on a Coney 
Island roller coaster? The most dangerous thing, I mean, people get killed all the 
time in those days. Well, we go into the rolle
r coaster and it™s just 
really bad, I mean 
it™s really -- I mean it™s one
 of these extreme things. We
 get on th e top, we come 
diving down  and this girl goes limp on me
. She basically -- whatever, she either 
fainted or whatever. Well, I 
grab her, because you know, in
 those days they didn™t 
have any of the safety stuff, she could ha
ve fallen out. Well, we get off the roller 
coaster, she™s as white as a 
linen. And I say well, you know, I really have to take 
care of you, I saved your life. And she sa
id, well what do you want to do? I said, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
54
well you know, I have to take you somewh
ere. And that™s how we met and never 
left. So that™s the girl I saved. Sh
e always had an eye on me anyway. 
Q: Tell me about Mona™s fa
mily, and do you share a lot 
of values? What was her 
background? 
A: Yes, her father was a very unusual 
guy. He was a philosopher, he was in a 
Jewish tradition, a student. He really was 
a very bad businessman, very bad. But he 
was a scholar and he read. The mother
 pretty well ran -- wonderful woman, 
wonderful woman, her mothe
r. They ultimately 
ended up living w
ith us. And th -- 
Mona™s father, Joe and I got along very 
well. Joe™s idea was that the world is 
coming to an  end, and that you have to 
go and really live out on a farm somewhere, 
so it will be self sufficien
t. So he bought a 10 acre fa
rm, upstate New York, in 
Duch ess county and built a sort of a dink
y house, and -- and 
well, got cattle and 
geese and planted an orchard and the convers
ation was always surviv al. Subject that 
I sort of could relate to. This where we
nt during the Cuban -- Cuban episode. So  -- 

so he and I used to go up,
 you know, as the kids, my
 little children were growing 
up, leaving my mother-in-la
w and Mona and the little kids
 and he and I went up 
farming, to prepare for doomsday. It™s a l
ong, sad story. He used excessive amount 
of insecticide because he wasn™t a reside
nt there, and he u
ltimately got a stroke 
from -- from the insec
ticides, you know -- you know,
 the insecticide was very 
powerful, he over-overdosed  the place with  insectici -- in secticide an d herbicide. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
55
Q: Now, not realizing its toxicity? 
A: Well, he did, but he -- he was -- it 
was not on his mind. But I married into a 
wonderful family, I really -- he was a true 
friend. Joe was a true friend. Mother -- I 
called her Moth er, was a very loving person.
 She stayed with us
. She was really a 
true grandmother to my little ch ildren. Yo
u know, we had four children, one after 
another, and the-there was lots of work 
to be done. And my
 wife Mona never 
wanted to  have any serv ants. First we coul
dn™t afford it, so 
you know, my -- my -- 
my  wife washed the diapers. I me an, th
ere was no -- no such thing as -- you know, 
buying them, diapers. And she taught the ch
ildren -- she™s -- the 
children were very 
literate at the age of four. 
Q: So you re-created, and we -- and we
re blessed with a wonderful family. 
A: Actua -- 
Q :  S eemin g l y  so  mu ch  by  ch an ce. 
A: Well, i -- yeah -- 

Q: The girl in the -- 
A: Well, you know, there™s no such thing 
as a chance, you know. You know, the -- I 
-- I -- there were lots of girls I could have
 picked from, and there were some girls 
who were very seriously interested in me. 
In fact, there was one girl who actually 

announced  that she is marrying me and told
 everybody. And that™s bad, though, you 
don™t do that. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
56
Q: Yeah. No w you were -- you were 
eyeing the woman who was right. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: The sort of quiet one. 

A: Yeah, the quiet one. 

Q: And the reserved one, 
or -- or what have you. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: N-No w, tell me about your ch oices in
 raising th e children. To some extent 
you™ve explained that really in -- in telli
ng me how you started, 
but did you want to 
bring them up with this so-sort of real 
sense of their Jewish heritage? Did you 
observe religious holidays? 

A: No, we -- they had all choice. They all 
had choice, and one of
 them is religious, 
strong Jew, a devout Jew, reasonably so, 
and the other one no part of it. But 
everybody had a choice, and -- and that™s th
eir call. I never, for better or worse, for 
better or worse, never tried to tell my ch
ildren what to do. My model has always 
been they  have to find their own choices 
and then live with those choices. I was not 

going to  mastermind for them, anything. Noth ing. 
Q: Mm-hm. And tell me about the -- your ch
ildren. When  they were born, and their 
names.  

A: Well, Vera was born in 1957. She did ex
tremely well in school, in high school. 
She scored 800 on th e SAT, eight zero ze
ro, you know? [indecipherable]. You don™t 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
57
score 800 on the SA T. Then  she went to
 Johns Hopkin s and sh e was going to  be -- 
go study medicine, and something happened 
in Johns Hopkins, 
and I really don™t 
know what, where she sudden
ly  just decided she was very  insecure about herself. 
What it was, you know, I visited her; she 
just clammed up. She then  went for a 
Master™s degree in public health. Went
 to work for a number of insurance 
companies. She™s quite an expert in her 
field. She™s a recognized expert. She has 
maybe 80 published papers in the field. 
The men she always -- she is on her third 
marriage, a lthough one of th
em sort of had a heart attack and died  on her. But the 
men she always -- were sort of weak men.
 She -- she alw ays picked a very weak 

person. She has two beautiful children, abso
lutely gorgeous chil
dren. Sh e™s all right, 
but she™s still struggling. She still has to fi
gure out what she wants to do. You know, 
she™s 47 now. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: The second child is Andrew. Andrew  ha
s always been interested in simulation, 
war gaming. He is the Jew. Very militant, he
 -- he -- he wants to take on the whole 
world. 

Q: How much younger than Vera? 

A: He™s just barely less than two years 
younger than Vera. A
nd -- and Andrew has a 
Master™s degree from Carnegie Mellon 
and a su mma  c u m lau d e fro m Wesley an . 
He™s literate. He™s really a literate pers
on. I mean, he reads. You know, he™s a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
58
student. Has two boys. He married a woman 
he shouldn™t have married. He tells me, 
Dad, why didn™t you tell me? She -- she marr
ied him because she expected that he™s 
going to  be a rich man. When  she discovere
d he™s not going to  be a rich man, she 
just walked. It was just too much -- too 
much work for 
her to take care of. She -- 
she wanted to be taken care -- she was 
a Jewish prin cess, if you know that 
expression. 

Q: Sure. 

A: And, you know, Andrew is a very hard 
wo rking, very honest, straight kind of a 
kid. Ab -- as straight as they can be. I me
an, he™s never done anything crooked, or 
anything. He has only had two jobs. [ind
ecipherable] always 
everybody likes him 
on th e job. And that™s Andrew. Then
 comes Steven, two years later. 
Q: Mm-hm. Let me go back, first of all, 
to Andrew . Does he have cu stody of the 
children, or -- 
A: Oh yes, he -- 

Q: -- oh he™s -- he™s remarried. 
A: -- he™s got custody. 
Q: Oh, oh, okay. 

A: Oh, oh, yeah
, yeah, yeah -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
59
A: -- the judge looked at the situation and 
said, I don™t want that wa -- wa -- woman 
to -- to -- to -- to have anyt
hing to do with those childre
n, you know. Which is rare, 
by th e way. Of course, when  he got custod
y of the children, me and Mona got -- my  
wife got custody of the children. I mean, 
you -- you understand th
at, because he has 
-- he has work. And he™s a consultant, he travels.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So th at™s Andrew . Nice guy, a nice kid.
 Then you have Steven
. He™s the rascal of 
the family. Steven was bor
n two years later. The jokester. Bright as can be. 
Q: Like his father, sounds like? 
A: Oh, he™s a fa -- he™s a jokester. Never cr
acks a book in his life and always gets A 
grades. And I said, Steven, how do you 
do it? [indecipherable] well, I study the 
teacher, I don™t study th e subject. He has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., has a undergraduate 
degree. He just went to M.I.T. and stayed
. He would have stayed in M.I.T. all his 
life, he di -- had a great time, lots of gi
rls. Good looking boy. I mean, he just draws 
girls like -- like -- like, you kn
ow, the catnip, you know, ju
st very congenial. He™s a 
Boy Scout and an  Eagle Scout. 
A real solid citizen, honest
 as can be. Very smart, 
very good friend of mine. Ve
ry good friend of mine. I me an, he and I talk once or 
twice a day. Let me give you a Steven 
typical. Comes high school. I say, Steven, 
you have to start applying to
 college. He says, it™s too 
mu ch paperwork. And -- and 
then I-I say, well yeah, but you have to, you
 know, you have to spread your risk, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
60
you know, you have a numbe
r of col -- where do you wa
nt to go? Well Dad, you 
went to M.I.T., I go to M.I.T.. I say, it™s ha
rd to get to M.I.T.. 
Oh, don™t worry. So, 
you know, now -- now -- now, 
you know, it™s March and I say, Steven, wh ere are 
your applications? Well, I applied for early
 admission to M.I.T.. Now, you know, in 
those days, early admission means that youdon™t apply to anybody else and you™ve 
-- you understand, you -- you -- 
you -- you just roll your dice, and that™s it. I said, 
you can™t do that. He goes up to -- to -- 
to M.I.T. for an inte
rview. I buy him a 
Brooks Brothers suit, th-the kid has never wo
re a suit in his life before or ever after. 
One of the beautiful things 
about Steven is very early
, you know, I had co mputers 
in my  house. Never told the kids to go be
 interested in comput
ers. Steven -- all my 
kids had to go to  wo rk at the age of 13,
 just like my father, you know, you -- you 
have to have a trade. Stev
en decided to sell Apple com
puters. This is when Apple 
came out. Well, the salesman in the electr
onics store didn™t have a clue what an  
Apple computer was like. Steven was a ha
cker from the word 
go. He sold more 
Apple computers than anybody else. So -- so he goes 
up to M.I.T. and they -- during 
the interview he tells them how to se
ll microcomputers. M.I.T. said, well, you 
know, fine. Early admission? You™re in. So he comes back in the evening by train 

from Boston, sort of mischievously, like I di
dn™t do it kind of a thing. I say, well 
Steve, what happened? Well, 
they accepted me. I said, w ell, when are you starting? 
Well, they accepted me. So -- so he never 
filled out a piece of paper. I mean, he™s a 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
61
real rascal. I mean, this kid is a rascal. Ve
ry good natured, rea
lly helping me. Y-You 
know, I™m -- I™m doing some fa
irly complicated things. So
 that™s Steven. And then 
of course, comes -- 
Q: And M.I.T. made a good choice. 

A: And M.I.T. made a good choice, yeah
, yeah . And th en, of course, comes the 
apple of my  heart, Eric, the youngest
. Beautiful child. I mean, this kid had 
everything. Eagle Scout. He was -- he™d ha
s his own software comp any. He started 

doing so ftware in high school, when a t
eacher gave him a project to do, physics, 
like a pendulum, he wrote a software program to solve all the pendulum problems 

in the wo rld, and handed in a floppy disk
 as his homework. The teacher then said, 
you know what -- and now, 
Eric is now 14. There may be other kids who would 
want to -- to -- to take advantage of this
 thing. So Eric, with my help, opens a 
software business, Strassmann, Incorp
orated, and start selling and licensing 
worldwid e, Apple programs to be peddled 
to high schools thro
ughout the world to 
solve homework 
in physics.  
Q: Wh-Where were you living then? Where 
did th -- where did he go to school? 
A: Well, we -- we -- w e -- we lived in Ne
w York and then when
 Vera came we had 
a small, tw o bedroom apartm
ent. And then when the ot
her kids came, I bought a 
house in Mo unt Vern on, a four bedroom ap
artment. I always wanted the kids to 
have their own bedrooms. A
nd then I built, in 1969 -- in ™68, this absolutely 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
62
gorgeous house in Chappaqua, a six bedroo
m house. I mean it really  -- it made the 
front page of the real esta
te section of the New York  
Times. It was made out of 
redwood, I mean, and it was made by Finnis
h carpe -- boat carpenters, who used to 
come during the winter season when Finland 
sort of freezes up, to
 w o rk  h e re w h ere 
it™s warmer. And they built my
 house like a ship. I mean, 
it was really some house. 
Q: Like Shackleton™s boat. 
A: Oh yeah, that -- that was r
eally built. And -- and so --

Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This 
is an interview with Paul Strassmann, co
nducted by Margaret West, on January the 
8
th
, 2004, in New Canaan, Conn
ecticut. This interview is part of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview 
project, and is a follow up 
interview to a USHMM videotaped interv
iew conducted with Paul Strassmann on 
July the 11
th
, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making th
is interview possible. This is tape 
number three, side A. Chappaqua. 
A: Chappaqua.  

Q: You -- 

A: So s -- and Eric could do anything. 
He -- he was a worker, for instance. You 
know, he was 12 years old when we built th
e house. He laid the pavement for the 
sidewalks. He -- he was a worker. This kid,
 I mean, you know, we have pictures of 
him, always with a shovel, or something, 
or helping. A scout, ve
ry mu ch admired as 
a scout. Very thoughtful. He -- he was a -- 
a child that was thi
nking about -- was not 
impulsive. He was a very thoughtful, very br
ight, but not assertive, he was sort of a 
lovable teddy bear. Everybody 
loved this kid. And -- and 
-- but he always liked to 
experiment. He did -- I mean, he did always
 something, you know
, he -- he -- he put 
a knife into the electrical so
cket when he was three years old. He climbed this tall 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
64
tree that we have here, this 50 foot tree, 
all the way to the top to see how far he can 
go. As quiet as he was, he
 was always pushing the limit.
 This kid did not have any 
limits. And so we lost him 
in 1984. I mu st say that was the mo st devastating thing 
that ever happened to  me. I mean, this is
 -- you know, wh en yo
u look at life, you 
know, what happened  over the last 75 years,
 that is the thing that was the -- the 
worst thing. Worse than the Holocaust, worse than anyt
hing, because this kid was 
just -- and he™s destroyed my wife. I mean
, she -- she just abso
lutely shrank, as a 
result. And life has never been the same. 
He was such a good ki
d, and -- and -- you 
know, I -- I always felt that if I ev er ha
ve somebody who could be a president of the 
United States, that was the 
kid who could make it. You 
know, the -- the -- when you 
get an Eagle Scout, there™s a -- what™s ca
lled a court of honor. Do  you know about 
Eagle Scouts? 
Q: I do. 
A: It™s a big deal. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: It™s a big deal. 
Q: It shows a lot of discipline and dedi
cation and it™s a big accomp lishment for a 

kid.  

A: And -- and ch arisma, becaus
e you have to be able to 
organize the other kids, who 
look to him as a lead
er. Everybody always lo
oked to him as a l
eader because hewas 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
65
not a pushy -- he was a leader leader, he ac
tually went out and did things. He wa -- 
a-at the court of honor the scout executive 
said, well I™ve seen lots
 of Eagles in my  
life, never seen one like this. So 
that is the tragedy, yeah, yeah. 
Q: What happened? 
A: Ah, it™s a long story. It™s -- it™s a -- y
eah. It™s -- again, he was pushing, he was 
pushing the limit. 

Q: Mm-hm. And of course pushing the limit is what special people do. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: And I suppose -- would you say that th
at™s what you had done always? Or was 
Eric [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah
, an-and he was very clos
e to me. You know, his 
statement always were, when 
I grow up I want to be just
 like Dad. And he always 
asked me how -- why did you do 
this, why did you do this?  
Q: What did you -- I wondered 
if there™s anything special that you did in memo ry of 
him. I only ask that cause -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- sometimes -- oh, I -- I™
m -- I shouldn™t be putting hi
s on tape [indecipherable] 
A: Well, what happened was, he was so
 admired at Harvard that Harvard did 
something th at has never been done befo
re. The students, from their own money, 
when  they  graduated, decided to  take a
ll the money -- because you know, when  the

students go in and th ey sell their books and 
furniture to the next class, and what 
have you, they took all th
e money and informed the facu
lty that they are putting a 
granite bench with Eric™s name on the quad
rangle. No w, you know, there™s lots of 
rich kids at Harvard and so forth. There™s 
lots of parents. Mr. Bok, who was the pre 
-- chairman -- president of 
Harvard was so taken -- 
Q: Derek Bok. 

A: -- Derek Bok was so taken by it, that 
he gave permission fo r the students to put 

that bench into the grove on
 the quadrangle and it™s still th
ere to this day. What I 
have done, Eric™s royalties for the softwa
re -- you know, by the 
way, all my books 
are dedicated to him -- Eric™s royaltie
s go into a fund to  send Boy Scouts who 
cannot afford it to su
mmer camp. It continue
s to this day. And there is a library, 
Eric™s computer library in -- in a kibbut
z in Israel. There is a funding to put 
computer books there in his 
memory. It™s going to be 20
 years this year, and I™m 
putting together, right now, in the middle, 
putting together a book about Eric for his 

siblings and for the grandchildren. 
Q: Good. You know, I™d -- I -- 
my  comment before, it doesn™
t really have a place in 
the interview, but a boy who lived next doo
r died on that Lock
erbie plane crash. 
A: Yeah. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
67
Q: Special -- a special young man, I th
ink, and his parents started a mu sic 
scholarship, and it just simply that 
it™s -- the students benefiting from the 
scholarship has been 
helpful to them -- 
A: Oh yeah, I know -- 
Q: -- to feel that -- 
A: -- that it™s the right thing to do. 
Q: -- but it™s some --  

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- yeah. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But I™m sorry that you had su ch a loss.
 Hard for -- hard for your other children, 
too. Their loss is different to yours, but
 they see you suffering in a way they -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- both parents, anyway. The -- going 
on. Let™s move on now to your career. 
A: Okay, yeah. 
Q: I really -- family came first. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But then you™ve had a really most in
teresting career, which you say was because 
you became involved with computers,
 but I think it was much more. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
68
A: Yeah, wh-what happened over here wa
s after Cooper Union,
 when I™ve -- and I 
finished Tau Beta Pi, and you know, hono
rs, and number two man in a very tough 
school. Cooper Unio n is a tough school be
cause it™s all -- everybody there is on 
scholarship. And it was very competitive, th
ese were -- this was the last crop of 
World War II veterans who went on the G.I. 
Bill of Rights to school, and th-they -- 
they were a different generation, I me
an, very serious students, I mean no 
horseplay , no nothing. And my  conclusion
s was that although I loved engineering 
and always wanted to  be an engineer, I felt
 that I just didn™t have -- I was not an 
educated person. And there was a trustee 
of Cooper Union by the name of Rossi, 
who set up a scholarship for the Sloane Sc
hool at M.I.T., which in those days was 
other than  Harvard Business School, but 
fo r engineers it was the school on -- on -- 
on -- on management. And I was nominated fo
r the Rossi scholarship, because of all 
of that. And I basically said that -- that 
I would love to go to M.I.T. -- and by the 

way, M.I.T. accepted me, but a Strassmann 
doesn ™t take scholarship money from 
anybody, I am self-supporting. Now everybody
 tells me , including my  wife Mona, 
that was absolutely stupid. 
But I declined the scholarship
 because I consid ered it a 
act of charity. Now, this was still the 
old way, you know, you don™t take money 
from anybody. 

Q: Adolf Strassmann™s son. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
69
A: Yeah, I don -- doesn™t take money from 
anybody. So -- and I just made quite a 
bit of money wo rking on th e New Jersey tu
rnpike, summers. So -- so -- so I said, 
well, I™m going to pay my  own way, which 
I could afford . You know, in those days 
the tuition at M.I.T. was 40 -- 4,500 dollars, 
which was an awful lo
t of money, but I 
made eight. And of course, I worked overt
ime and weekends a
nd what have you, 
but I had 8,000 dollars, so I 
could afford 4,500 dollars. So
 I went to M.I.T. Sloane 
school. That™s when I started dating Mona. 
Mona was either in New York  or at her 
dad™s country place in Salt Point, New York
, Godforsaken place out in the boonies. 
And she just said, well, if you™re in terested in me, you better court me. And I asked 

her father for permission for me to cour
t her, you know. He says, take her, you 
know? He liked me very mu ch. But, 
you know, you don™t -- did -- don™t ask -- 
nobody does that any mo re. So 
I said, yeah, but i-in the Bi
ble, you -- I have to earn 
a wife, and I don™t have money. So , he sa
id, well, you know, wh at do you want to 
do? I said, well I want to do so mething on
 this farm for you so  that I can show, 
because it was a -- Abraham built for his fath
er-in-law Laban, a enclosure for sheep. 
Said, I™m going to build 
something for you. And my 
father-in-law -- potential 
father-in-law said, well, you know, I coul
d really use a barn. So I built a 22 by 22 
barn to earn my wife, which was subject to lots of conversations over the years. So I 

finished that, and the -- 
Q: Who helped you? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
70
A: Oh, my father-in-law helped me, yo
u know, you know. But -- but I d -- I did 
quite a bit of it myself. But that was cons
idered t-to be that, you know, how old-
fashioned do you want to ge
t, I mean, you know, you™re 
really getting Biblical. But 
I felt, you know, I have to earn -- this is a wi
fe, I have to earn it, you know? So that 
was that. So while I was working weekends
 on the barn, I was 
also working for a 
comp any who was build ing the New Jersey tu
rnpike. And the problem was that that 
summer there was a dispute about toll colle
ctors, and you may or ma y not have 
heard that story. You haven™t heard the story? 

Q: No. 
A: Oh, that™s the story. Well, I™m sitti
ng in a drafting room, 
checking blueprints, 
you know, a-and there was no 
air conditioning, and when you
 lean your sweat on an 
Ozalid blueprint, you leave an orange mark
, yeah, really miserable, smelly, but that 
was the job I had. An d one day as -- as --
 as A l Matimbi, the senior partner of 
Howard, Needles, Tammen and Bergendoff, 
a very distinguishe
d consulting firm, 
they built most of the turn pikes in the United States, walks through. He says, 
Strassmann, I understand you 
going to  M.I.T.. Yeah. What are you going to  study? I 
said, well I™m going to study management. 
He said, well do you know anything 
about statistics? Oh, sure. Well, we got a 
problem. We have a union dispute on the 
New Jersey turnpike we just built, where 
the toll collectors say that we are -- that 
they are overworked. And we need some
how to figure out whether they are 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
71
overw orked or not, because th
e governor goes through th
e tollgates and finds that 
they are just standing th ere doing nothing. 
Course the governor goes to work  at 11 
o™clock in the morning, but -- ah, so I said
, oh, th-th-this thing is answer, you know, 
you have punch tickets in ev
-ev-every toll gate, with ro
und holes. All you have to 
do is count the punch tickets
 and find out how many cars go th rough, do some time 
motion studies on the toll collector -- I ma
ke it up as I go, and we™ll figure out 
whether they are overworked or not. He 
said, you know what? 
Let me take you off 
this -- this drawing board a
nd let me put you to work  on the New Jersey turnpike. 
For the next two years in grad school, 
I processed hundred thousands of punch 
cards from the New Jersey turnpike, throug
h the only place in the world wh ere there 
was a computer like this, M.I.T
.. When I got done I had a Master™s thesis, which is 
today considered to be the first Master™s
 thesis in the United States on business 
application of computer. That computer
 scheduled toll collectors and compared 
what they  were doing against what the m
ach ine was doing. I got paid an awful lot 
of money. Howard, Needles got paid
 extremely well for this thing.  
Q: Everybody was happy. 
A: Everybody was happy. I finally had enou
gh money to be able to afford a wife, 
because I was not going to have a wife -- 
my father-in-law was going to give me 
money. I said, f-forget about it, you know,
 I -- I™m supporting my wife. So -- so I 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
72
got into  computers in 1954. 
Really liked it and from then  on I was in computers and 
-- and -- so you sort of wand
er into  these things almo st -- almo st by accident. 
Q: Well, to what extent do you think th at 
your career has been luck , arising out of 
the story you just told, or 
is it much more complex, w
ith strands that come from 
your back ground and also 
energy and discipline and -- 
A: Well -- 
Q: -- maybe ambition. 

A: Yeah, my -- my children have always as
ked me the question. My answer to that 
is everybody has luck . The question is, 
do you pick it up or 
not. But everybody, 
sooner or later, has luck. The -- everybod
y has coincidences, and some people jump  
at it, and some people sort of walk away from it, or don™t recognize it. 
Q: Yes. 
A: So -- 
Q: Someone else might have said, oh I don™t
 think you -- I™m prepared at M.I.T. to 
help you with those punch cards. 
A: Oh, yeah, something lik
e -- something like that. And -- and so the ga -- the 
question is -- again, coming back to  this w
hole question of choice, luck is -- and I™m 
giving you the mathematical concept, luck 
is an event, it™s in -- what™s called a 
node. And out of that node 
goes a number of options. One of the options is to do 
nothing. Another option, of course, not ev
en  know that you have a node. No w the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
73
real game of life is that you have 
a node, wh ich happens, and it happens to 
everybody. Now, of course, if you are in 
America, you have mo re
 nodes than if you 
are in the Soviet Union. I mean, this is -- th
is is part of the social context. In other 
word s, you cannot say that a 
peasant in India a -- or in 
-- in Bangladesh has all his 
luck opportunities. Th -- you kn
ow they are -- the tragedy,
 they are all constrai ned 
in a world where there are no choices at 
all. B u t if you are in America and you 
happen to  be moving in a given direction 
wh ich seems to be evolving and wh ere the 
options are continually opening -- in othe
r words, if you are in
 -- in making buggy 
whip s, you know, ther -- ye -- you know, 
you™re th -- unless you do something else, 
you know, you just don™t have 
those options. But the luck is
 there, it™s always there. 
In America more so. And as you climb up 
on the chain of luck
, which by the way 
looks -- gr-graphically it™s re
presented at wh at™s called a decision tree. I don™t -- I 
mean, there™s a formal branch
 of economics called decision trees. By the way, ma -- 
the first professional paper I ever wrote,  that was published, was on so-called 
stocastic decision trees. Stocastic is proba
bilistic decision trees tr -- d ec -- decision 
trees that branch out probab
ilistically. Which means at an
y given juncture you don™t 
only have branches, one or two branches, bu
t you have a whole spectrum. It™s just -- 
just occurred to me I never mentioned it th
at way, but that -- comin g  back to the 

question of -- of luck, what you learn from 
Holocaust, coming back to the theme, is 
that certain things happen, or the -- what 
happened in 1944 is
 that I go where the 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
74
shooting is. I go up the mountain, I get a 
hand grenade, co me down th e mo untain 
and there is bunch of Ru ssian commando 
groups who just looking fo r somebody 
just like me to walk ahead
 of them, okay? Now that™s stupid luck , okay? Now 
somebody else would say, we
ll, you know, I™m not going to
 go with the Ru ssians. 
By the way, the guy who went with  me, i
mme -- immediately wanted no part of it 
because the Russians were rea
lly a ragtag bunch of bandits
. I mean, they were really 
a bunch of bandits. And I say,
 bandits, you know, this is
 fine, you know? Besides, 
they wanted me, you know. Besides, they
 gave me a rifle, you know? So lu ck 
happens and then you learn to
 -- to push it -- push it, as far as you can do. No w, in 
case of my  son Eric, he pushed 
it too far. But, there you go. 
So -- so th -- that is the 
model, then. The -- the model of the Ho
locaust is that those people who get 
squashed , and th ere are lots of them
, wh-who -- you -- you know, the people who 
brought me to America, you know, the fri
end of my father™s and so forth -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- they stayed confined. Th
ey started -- they went into
 the Jewish lodge and they 
meet Sundays, for years and years, bemo an
ing the tragedy and wh at happened, and 
they sti-still speak Sl
ovak, and they have lectures ab
out, you know, Vienna in 1934, 
and th -- Prague -- you know, Prague theate
r in 1932. I mean, th
ey™re still in the 
back country. They™re s
till mentally back there. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
75
A: The -- the -- the -- th-the model that I be
lieve I represent is -- th e notion is that 
opportunities happen, and you have to lo
ok fo rward, and see how far it gets you, 
even if it kills you.  
Q: Take risks, seizes o p portunities. 

A: Seize opportunities, take risk, and -- bu
t do it within certain confines of value, 
because there are others who came to the United States, Jews -- 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- who basically went after mo ney, 
you know, how mu ch money can I make? 
And they become speculators
, criminals, embezzlers, c
on artists, stock market map 
-- manipulators and all of that. There™s -- you know, New York  is full of that. I 
mean, there™s -- there is a whole Jewish  money-optimizing, 
with no feeling for 

America, no feeling for the community, nofeeling for the society, who are very, 
very successful, particularly in  real estate and so forth. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: You know, beco -- 
becoming billionaires. Money is an
 outcome. I always tell my 
children, wh ether you get money, or d
on™t get money, well that™s an outco me. 
That™s not a goal, ever. So, you know, on
e has to really put around this whole 
question of -- of values, also
 a question of what do you represen -- what are your 
beliefs? What is the ethics? And what is
 the -- what™s called the sense of honor. 
Q: Right. Which -- wh ich your faith t -- informs, if you like, if you allow it. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
76
A: Yeah. 
Q: I mean, what 
your faith teaches. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: To -- 

A: Yeah, th-th -- this is the essence of
 faith. The essence of faith is grace, 
fellowship, trying to  make life better if 
you can, and have responsibility to your 
society and to your community. And so that
™s -- it™s this -- but you never, never 
compromise on that, even if it works ag
ainst you. Fo r instance, you know, th e 
people in the Jewish circle, particularly
 the people who brought me to America, 
always berated me that I never applied for 
reparations from the Nazis. I mean, just -
- you know, it™s unthinkable. I me an, it™s 
just -- just not right. Just not right. 
Q: They felt? 
A: No, I felt it was not right. 
Q: Oh, right. 

A: But they felt it was not right for me
 not to do it because you know, I™m -- I™m 
leaving th e -- the bastards with money. Bu t i -- but -- but that™s not the question of 

money, it™s a question of honor. 

Q: Yes. You know, I -- I know sometimes 
people feel that it™s at least a -- a -- a 
gesture that has meaning fo r them. I m
ean, wh-wh-wh -why do you th ink y -- y -- 
you feel it™s sort of morally wrong? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
77
A: Yeah, a -- a -- a moral wrong di
 -- does not get right by money. 
Q: By a pay -- amount of money. 
A: By paying th em the money, ever. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Okay. You know, that™s -- that
™s -- that™s very
 fundamental. 
Q: Yes. I have to think about that, just 
because I was thinking of a case where a 
friend wh ose, you know, family lost property
 in Vienna, but just felt deeply moved 
to -- to get this sort of -- the paperw ork of reparations and so on. The -- the 
acknowledgement of -- 
A: That was so wrong that the acknowled
gement isn™t good en ou
gh. No amount of 
acknowledgement is good enough, okay? 

Q: Yes, of course, yeah, you™re -- you™re
 right. I -- I needed to think about it. 
A: Yeah, yeah. No -- I mean, ju
st not right. Certain things
 are such horrible crimes -
- 

Q: Yeah. But how can -- 
A: And sometimes doing the right thing, ag
ainst your interest, turns out to be 
unbelievably attractive 
and profitable. Let me  give you a si -- my  favorite story. My 
favorite story is here I become the chief 
information officer of Kraft. You know, 
Sealtest milk, ice cream, cheese o n  the 
load ing dock. I have 48 computers making it 
possible for people to come up at four o™
clock in the morning 
to the sh -- loading 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
78
dock, get the pieces of paper, where they deliv
er this ice cream, or this cream and so 
forth. And it -- now it™s 1963, and I just
 can™t get all of the -- the business is 
fantastic an d now they want 
mo re sophisticated delivery tickets, what have you, and 
IBM cannot do it. Just can™t do it. IB
M says, well look, we are making new 
machines, the 360 series are going to be 
fantastic, but we cannot
 give you machines 
that can cope with your wo
rkload. And I said, guys, y
ou know, you keep promising 
things to me and you™re not delivering. Well,
 it turns out that I get a phone call from 
a guy by the name of Art Messerschmitt 
fro m Syracuse, and he says, you know, I™m 
golfing with this Honeywell salesman a
nd the Honeywell salesman -- and I know 
they have a very good machine -- the Hone
ywell salesman tells me he™s going to 
put a Honeywell machine side by side with
 the IBM machine, charge me nothing, 
and when  the Honeywell ma ch
ine does exactly what the IB
M machine, but twice as 
mu ch for half the price, you have to pr
omise me that I can get rid of the IBM 
machine. Now, in 1963 getting rid of IBM 
is, if you know, no-no.
 I mean, they just 
-- not good for your career. Y
ou understand that? I said -- 
Q: Now -- yes, I -- I k n ow the saying, nobody -- 
A: [indecipherable] fired. 

Q: -- what did they say? Nobo
dy ever gets fired for -- yeah. 
A: So I say, Art, you know, what 
the hell? Go ahead and do it. So Art 
Messersch mitt brings in the Honeywell machin
e, slides it in, it is fantastic. Get rid 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
79
of that IBM machine. Well, 
so then the other controlle
rs -- I mean, you know, the 
milk business, these are -- the people in
 Sealtest and Kraft are middle America. 
Penny pinching, honest farm gu
y, none of this fancy New York stuff. And they said, 
what the hell, you know? It™s 
three cents for a carload of this stuff, let™s get some 
more Honeywells in, so the -- I started ro
lling in Honeywell. Well, IBM gets very 
excited. What IBM does in those days is th
ey get the guy who does this thing fired. 
Q: Mm-hm, yeah. 
A: I mean -- [indecipherable] So they -- 
Q: I should add -- you know, when  we made
 that comme nt, an aside, I should finish 
it, which is, nobody ever 
gets fired for buying IBM. 

A: That™s right [indecipherable] 

Q: Anyway. 
A: Yeah, well, the -- it
 work s the other way. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: He gets fired if you get rid of IBM.
 So IBM sends one of their heavies, an 
executive vice-president to have
 golf with Edwards, the 
Chairman of the Board of 
Kraft. And they go golfing, they ™re having 
a good time, they™re 
friends and this. Oh, 
then after the golf, the exec
utive vice president of IBM 
says to the chairman of 
Kraft, you know, this guy Strassmann is rea
lly taking lots of risks, I mean, getting 
rid of -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
80
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
A: -- this guy has reputation. He™s a risk 
taker, and you know, if you were in the 
busin ess, you don™t want to take any risks. 
Besides, IBM is going to have th ese new 
machines, you know. And Go rdon Edward s, 
a good old Texan, sa
ys, you know, Joe, 
when you have those machines
 and you™re ready to sh ip them, we have -- you have 
orders for them, yeah. We™ll test them 
too. Meanwh ile, Strassmann is shipping ice 
cream on a loading dock and it™s not melting.
 So, you know, what™s the problem? 
So Strassmann -- everybody -- of course ever
ybody tells this story, you know, the -- 
the -- the -- the -- the Kraft company is
 good old boys. This is sen -- middle 
America. This is good old 
boys, you know. They think 
this is very funny. They 
think this is a riot. They talk about it. 
Four years later, Xerox decides to go into  
computer business. And they buy this co
mp any, which was a bad comp any to begin 
with, p-pay billion dollars for it. T h e chairm
an of the board of Xerox announces that 
the way how they™re going to pr
ove that this turkey is re
ally good is that we are 
going to  get rid of all of our IBM comput
ers, and I have just the guy who knows 
how to get rid of. So they 
hire me, double my salaries 
and were willing to pay me 
5,000 shares of Xerox stock for every IBM 
computer I get rid of. That™s what built 
this house. Every store you look in ther
e™s an IBM computer. You know, I can point 
to the [indecipherable] you know. So -- so 
that is how things can sometimes work 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
81
for you. Xerox needed -- th
e only guy with a track record of getting rid of IBM 
computers in the Un ited States, was Paul Strassmann. 
Q: Good story. 

A: So, a similar story is -- a similar story 
is when I retired fro
m Xerox -- again, I™m 
distr-splaying a morality. The morality is
, good, bad or indifferent -- I mean, 
Gord on Edwards could have come back 
from that golf game and fired me on the 
spot, for whatever reason. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But that™s not the way I play the game. If 
they would have wanted
 to fire me, this 
was not going to  be a comp any for me to 
work for anyway, y
ou know. Years later, 
I™m wi -- q u ite an expert, I write a coup
le of books about computers. General 

Moto rs buys EDS, this big corporation.
 EDS takes over all computers from General 
Motors, it™s a absolute disaster. Ross Pero
t gets greedy, starts charging General 
Moto rs excess money. General Mo tors pl
an t managers don™t get any bonuses, EDS 

gets all the bonuses. So the vice-chairman of
 General Motors is given the job to find 
out whether EDS is overcharging or not. 
Guess who they hire? Paul Strassmann. 
You see, I don™t have any c
onsultants, I don™t have -- I don™t bring in a big staff. I 
am a well known expert in the fie-field. I study the situation, I call up the vice-

chairman of General Motors 
and say, look, they™re overch
arging you. And then  he -
- he says, well how much are they overcha
rging me? They  are overcharging you at

least 300 million dollars a year, which is qui
te a bit of money. And it™s actually 
more, but 300 million dollars 
you can prove. So he says
, you know, this is very 
difficult, Ross Perot is on the Board of Dire
ctors of General Motors. I have to bring 
it up befo re the board . Why don™t you wr
ite a half page memo randum, stand by 
until the board meeting and just before the 
board meeting you fax 
it to my secretary 
outside of the board meeting and I™ll read 
it to  the board. Which 
he does -- I mean, 
this was going to be hush-hush. By th
ree o™clock in the afternoon every plan t 
manager in General Mo tors who hates th
e guts of EDS has a copy of Strassmann™s 
memo that they™re ov
ercharged by 300 million doll -- wh
ich is out of their pocket, 
you know?  
Q: Mm. 

A: So General Motors says, you know, sorry
, you know, this really caused all kinds 
of problems. We™re going to 
pay you your fee, but we 
cannot employ you any mo re. 
I come home, Mona tells me, you know, St
rassmann, again, you know, you just 

play it straight, you know? You missed 
a great opportunity getting a consulting 
contract from General Motors. You -- c
ouldn™t you 
have varnished it a little or 
something? I say, well that™s the way it is
. Six months later, the vice-chairman of 

General Mo tors is now deputy secretary 
of defense, working for Dick Cheney. 
Soviet Union co llapses -- 
Q: Who -- who would that be? 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
83
A: Donald Atwood. 
Q: Okay I mean a -- wondered
 if I knew the name. Anyway . 
A: Yeah, Donald  Atwood. 
Q: Yes. That™s not the point, it™s [indecipherable] 

A: W-We -- Congress decides [indecipherable]
 dividend, cuts the department of ar -
- Department of Defense budget by 75 b
illion dollars. And Cheney
 turns to Donald 
Atwood say, well you know, find the 75 
billion dollars. Donald can find 30, but 
there is -- he™s short, you know, he™s short 
quite a bit. So he said, well we are going 
to do it by corporate information [indeciph
erable] we are going 
to bring into the 
department of defer -- corporate informa
tion management based 
on computers. You 
know, this is -- this is -- this is a holy 
grail, you know, every couple of years this 
idea perks up and dies.  
Q: Okay . 
A: Okay . And I am just the bastard who 
knows how to do it. And guess wh at? I get 
pulled in to the Department of Defense as 
the first Chief Information Officer of the 
Department of Defense -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- to do th e job.  

Q: And I assume you were much needed. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
84
A: Oh yes. I mean, everybody agrees
 and you know, I and -- you know, I 
[indecipherable] I don™t know how many billions
 I saved, but I at least set the thing 
in a direction -- finally Ru msfeld is doing it now, but it takes a long time to move 
that -- that thing. But ag
ain, you know, who would ha
ve known that by calling the 
shots on General Motors, w
ould end -- will end me up in
 this -- this position. So 
there™s a story. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Now, just to show you ho
w luck or opportunity works,
 I get into the Department 
of Defense, and I look around, an d I say, 
well what™s wrong is computers report to 
the contro ller. Computers should not report 
to the controller because finance people 
just keeps computers under throttle, comput
ers is a weap on, it™s a military weapon, 
it™s a comm and and control weapon. Let™
s yank out the computers away from the 
controller. Now, to do that in
 the Department of Defense, 
I mean, is -- this is hard. 
Q: Rock the boat. 

A: Tha-That™s really rock
ing the boat. We rocked th
e boat, guess what? Donald  
Atwood wanted to do it anyw ay, now he pulls the respon
sibility for computers away 
from the controller of the depart -- where 
it has been for the 
prior 50 years. The 
contro ller of the Department of Defense is
 a guy by th e name of Sean O™Keefe. So 
we -- we make an enemy right there. So 
we take it out, we bring it under and the 
assistant Secretary of Defense for command 
and control, the military loves me. The 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
85
military just loves me. I get a big checkb
ook, I start spending money on the special 
forces, who until then 
didn™t get the money. They make me an honorary Green 
Beret, they find out that I was a guerilla fi
ghter. Boy, this is one of our guys, he™s 
one of ours. And of course, I give them
 the money, you know, I mo ve the money 
away from finance and give it to the wa
r fighters. I mean , you can™t go wrong, I 
mean. So the story then goes, I retire fro
m the Department of Defense with all the 
honors, you know, but when  C
linton gan -- co mes in, that™s
 not the place for me to 
be, I mean, I just can™t stand the guy.
 NASA gets into trouble. The new 
administrator of NASA is one Sean O™Keef
e. He says, I know just the bastard to 
straighten out this place. 

Q: Well, he -- yo-you made an enemy of hi
m, but he co uld see that the action taken 

was right? 
A: No, what happens is that people disa
gree with me, but everybody respects me. 
Q: Exactly. 
A: Yeah. And so  I get a call that, you kn
ow, would you like to 
do some consulting 
for NASA? So I -- sure. I come down to NA
SA. They showed me 
everything else. I 
didn™t know I was walking into a setup. I ga
 -- arrive at NASA at nine o™clock in the 
mo rning. They give me the review of the s
ituation. I said, you guys are just in an 
awful mess. Okay, Mr. Strassman n, what 
would do? I said, well there are three 
things you have to do. We
ll, you know, now it™s 3:30 in th e afternoon, would you 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
86
like to walk up and present your findings to 
the administrator? I walk in, oh Paul, so 
nice to see you, so glad to
 see -- you know. I present the 
thing, and he said, well, 
you know, that makes awful sense. Gue
ss what, you™re staying here and you™re 
going to fix it. I said, well 
I™m here for a consulting. 
No, you™re coming -- you™re 
staying here and fixing it. 
I say, well you cannot appoint me to a senior executive 
position in the federal government that ea
sily . He said, you th ink I can™t? So he 
said, well, will you take it? I say, well, you 
know, I am a servant of this country. If -
- if I am asked to do something -- he sa
ys, just wait a moment, picks up the phone, 
brings in lawyers, what have you. I walk 
at 6:30 that evening with a badge, as the 
Chief Information Officer of NASA. Now,
 the question is luck, opportunity, or 
what, but there is a pattern. You k
now, I have many stories like that. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I mean, lots of stories like that. The -- 
the -- the paradigm of
 the Holocaust, the -- 
coming back to the Holo
caust is that what I learned fro
m the Holocaust is that there 
is always opportunity. You 
cannot stay in a position wh ere there™s no opportunity, 
because you die, one way or a
nother. And this is true. In 
the Holocaust this is also 
true, in business, this true everywhere 
in life. And within  bounds of ethics and 
honor and commitment and service, you ju
st do what™s right. And then if you 
happen to get money for it, well so be it.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
87
A: But that™s not the way I make the -- th
e decisions. That™s not the way to make 
decisions. 
Q: You know, there™s a Quak er sa
ying, you do good, and do well.  

A: Well, sure, y -- well, yeah. But -- and the well may or may not come. 

Q: Mm-hm. That™s right. 
A: So that -- that is really -- I think -- not
 just Paul Strassmann, this is -- this is 
bigger than Paul Strassmann, has to do with  history of Jews -- 
Q: Oh. 
A: -- has to do with preservation, has to do -- 
Q: That™s what I was going to ask. It™s not 
just the Holocaust, it™
s really the history 
of a people. 

A: It™s a -- oh, history of 
a people. Jews, when you look at
 the history of the people, 
have been extremely succe
ssful in survival. They 
are the oldest survive -- 
continually survivable civilization and cult
ure. There™s nobody else who goes that 
far back in a line of succe
ssion. The Egyptians are gone, the Romans are gone, the 
Greeks are gone. The Chinese empire has co
me and gone. But as a continuum, as a 
thread, there has be -- there has been a para
digm there that basically says that you -- 
you -- you -- you diversify. Yo
u don™t know -- do not get 
stuck in Judea. Sure, you 
may fight the Ro mans, but everybody else who fo ught the Ro mans and stayed  

where they  were, are gone.  

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
88
Q: And then I was thinking of Eric™s place 
in that evolution, that you lose some -- 
A: Yeah, and then
 you lose some.  
Q: Of -- 
A: There™s horrendous losse
s. There are horrendous 
losses in the process.  
Q: Mm. But you could say they™re not in
 vain, because they™re part of the -- 
A: They™re part of the -- part of the -- 

Q: -- thread. 

A: -- part of the thread. 
Q: And all your -- all your honors and awards are -- 
A: So what? 

Q: -- fit with the pattern -- I know. 

A: Yeah, yeah -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- yeah, yeah, just milestones, th
at™s all. That™s all they are. 
Q: Yes. [indecipherable][tape break] Th
ere are many other things we haven™t 
covered.  

A: Oh, sure. My relationship with the Ho
locaust Museum goes back  to perh aps as 
early as 1990 -- no, no, no, no, 1988, when
 -- 1988 when I gave a lecture at the 
Holocaust Museum on -- on th
e fact that the great lessons of the Slovak no -- 
uprising was the fact th at a Jewish brigad
e at the labor camp, the slave labor camp, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
89
marched out as a bat -- armed battalion, as 
organized battalion and participated as a 
Jewish organized military 
unit, although the 
-- the Jewish brigade in the British 
army  was organized in Tobruk in  Novemb er
 of 1944, the Jewish brigade organized 
in Slovakia as a Jewish 
unit, goes back to August 29
th
, 1944. And I wanted to point 
out that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is th
e first organized Jewish military unit that 
went to war since A.D. 70. There was some
 interest on the part of the Holocaust 
Museum, but in those days the Holocaust 
Mu seum was very mu ch  concerned about 
crying about the enormity of the crime, 
Holocaust. The idea of fighting, Jews 
fighting and opposing by actio
n, the actions on th e part of the Germans was not 
high on the agenda, except there was a 
-- a researcher in the -- in the -- the 
Holocaust Museum, a Dr. Sybil Milton, wh
o got very  mu ch in
terested in the 
subject, and subsequently, wh en I was in 
Washington, I met with Dr. Milton several 
times, we had lunch together. And I trie
d to convey  to you my  sense of the 
Holocaust, namely that this
 was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but it was a 
historical evolution of a state machinery 
that went berserk. In other words, the 
Nazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the st
ate to its ultimate fo
rm of destruction. 
You know, the state has always done p
ogroms and done injustice, and done all 
kinds of things, but here, the superiority 
of industrial organization and scientific 
organization, in fact, went to its ultimat
e co nclusion, namely, we are just going to 
plan, methodically, to destroy people. And 
the enormity of the Holocaust really  lies 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
90
in the fact that -- in its e
ngineering. In other wo rds, it was planned as an engineer 
could -- conscious process, 
where they were actually cal
culating the capacity of the 
cars, the capacity of the killi
ng, how quickly can we burn 
them. In other words, they 
applied scientific management. And th at is 
re ally the grossness,
 the horror of this 
thing, which I called the -- the bureaucrati
zation of Ho locaust. In other word s, the 
bureaucratization of genocid e. And the po
int that I was raising was that with 
advanced in formation technology, the st
ate can, through contro l of people, and 
eliminating privacy in the fu
ture, basically grind masses of
 people to destruction. In 
other words, endemic in the structure of mode
rn civilization, of industrializatio n, is 
a capability of massive destruction, by 
means out of anatomic weapons. Sybil 
Milton was very, very  mu ch taken by it. I then subsequently
 provided to the 
Holo caust Museum, a collection of docum
ents which I assembled, my sister  
actually helped with it, whic
h sh owed methodically how th
e various laws were used 
in Slovakia to gradually strip an innk
eeper, who was a veteran from World War I, 
and who received special licen
se to be an innkeeper an
d how that was taken away, 
and this was taken away and the fur coats 
was taken, and radio 
was taken, and so 
on, until you finally got rid of the innkeepe r altogether and then gassed him. And I 
gave a collection of something like 30 doc
uments, where the wife actually got a 
receipt for the husband. In 
other words, the bureaucracy 
worked with perfection and 
completeness and everything was legitim
ate and everything 
was signed and 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
91
everything was covered by law. It was 
passed by a duly  elected parliament. And 
then, of course, Sybil said, 
yeah, but where do computers 
come into this thing? And 
I said, well I don™t know, but 
when I look at this succ
ession of how Mr. Flak got 
eliminated, I can see a com
puterized society doing it much mo re efficiently, much 
more expeditiously, without any errors. S
ybil then went away. A month later Sybil 
calls me up and say, I have something inte
resting for you. She 
sends to me in the 
mail, copies of three pages from some ki
nd of German documentation, which shows 
a punch card, and shows a picture of what
™s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith 
machine, and says, could you tell me what 
it is? And -- and of course I said, surely, 
this is -- this is a machine th
at is being used , using census 
data in order to make sure 
that all the Jews and their property is prope
rly filtered out so that you can schedule 
the Jews to destruction. And she said, 
you know, we are building a -- a Holocaust 
Museum, it™s all crying and weeping, and 
what have you, but there™s nothing in 
there about this concept of the grindsto
ne of the bureaucracy actually being an 
engine of the Ho locaust. And she said, you 
know, it would be very interesting to be 
able to prove that the Ge
rmans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she 
didn™t distinguish between tabulating machin
e and -- and I said, yeah, that would be 
very interesting. I took the picture and se
nd it to a friend of mine who is a retired 
IBM executive. She said, oh we tried it be
fore, we asked IBM whether they had 
anything to do with providing tabulating 
machine to th e Nazis, you know. I said, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
92
Sybil, you mu st be kidding, you know. 
So  I send it to this guy in Denver, he™s 
retired, he looks at it, he says, oh, th
is is Dehomag number 
325, you know. And 
yeah, the card says so and so Jew, and 
property and lo cation 
and he™s accounted for. 
So Sybil says, you know wh at
, we really would need th
is kind of thing on the 
exhibit in order to make the point. Co
uld you get the Nazi machine? I said, you 
must be kidding, you know, 
there™s no such thing. Well, 
try anyway. So I sent out, 
because of my many connection -- you kno
w, I am a collector, you know, you saw 
that -- 

Q: Yes. 
A: -- I collect some stuff, you 
know that -- I love to go
 and lo ok for things. And 
someday I™m going to tell you some of the 
stuff that I was able
 to find. I mean, 
really, I have a story behind each. See, 
I collected every item 
in here, I bought and 
collected. 
Q: Yeah. And we should say that™s the IB
M mu seum of -- w-we should explain to 
them, anyways. 
A: Yeah. Well -- well, 
the museum -- the -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- Xerox Historical Museum of the Writte
n Word. Well at any rate, I sent out a -- 

a letter saying -- to all the computer museum
s in the wo rld, and there are four, you 
know, do you have a Dehomag 
number 302? Oh no, we ha
ven™t got it. I said, well, 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
93
if you find wa -- one of them, we really
 need it for a mu seum, could you -- could 
you let me know? Well, the Berlin wall fa
lls, three weeks later I get a phone call 
from the British museum, the engineering museum in -- in London on -- on -- on -- 
on -- next to the Imperial Museum. And th
ey said, you know, 
somebody™s offered 
us for sale, in Dresden, a Dehomag 302. I 
said, fine, can we buy it? Well, you know, 
they -- they just -- they -- th
ey -- they really would like 
to sell it for 2,000 dollars. I 
say, go buy it. Well, th en I go to the Holo
caust Museum, oh, you know, this -- we -- 
how do we know it™s authentic
, what is this and this? I said, 2,000 bucks guys, be 
real. Then they had to send 
somebody to -- to Germany to
 look at the machine, they 
didn™t know anything about 
the machine, they come ba
ck, yeah, there is such a 
machine. It -- actually the ai
r ca -- air -- th-the expens
e for -- was more than the 
machine. Well, finally they
 buy the machine. The m
achine is shipped to the 
warehouse in Baltimore where all of this st
uff was being staged prior to being -- to 
comp letion of the building. Th
is is before the building wa
s done. They invite me to 
come to authenticate the mach
ine, and of course my  frien
d in Denver tells me w h at 
to look at, what serial number and all of
 those things. I go and look at -- it™s a 
gorgeous machine, just gor -- you know, 
only the Germans can make this fine 
machine parts. It was a tabulator, it was a sorter, it was an input machine, the whole 

thing, whole shooting th ing. I said, you know, 
this is -- this is ju
st a beautiful thing. 
Well, would you please write something? So 
I wrote a script for 
the -- for the -- for 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
94
the -- for the display unit, called the bureau
cratization of genocide. Well, it didn't go 
over very well with the Holo
caust Museum. They ultimatel
y put the three machines 
on th e exhibit, but they  were taking too mu
ch space, so last 
time I know, they 
removed tw o of them. I find -- I have a 
real bad feeling about the Holocaust 

Museum, I just want you to  know. Many of
 the people who are the biggest donor to  
the Holocaust Museums are Jew s who are su
rvivors, who came to the United States, 
made lots of money and are heavily funding
 the museum. You know, this is -- this 
is their guilt trip. I -- y ou know. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Now I -- I may be overdoing it, but they
 really did not want to take it from th e 
fact it™s a crime to so mething that I see,
 it is something wh ich has mu ch broader 
consequence for the future. 
And wh en you are telling kids about the Holo caust -- 
well they say, well Hitler was a bad guy.
 Well, when -- when
 do we gonna get 
another Hitler? You know, it™s 
all the Nazis and the Hitler. 
Q: Ah, but the mission is, you know, it™s a 
government insti -- funded institution to  
educate. 

A: They don™t educate, in my  view, and 
I been to the Holoca
ust Museum twice, I 
spoke there. I look at -- I -- I ge -- I™m on 
the mailing list and so fo rth, and I listen to 
Elie Wiesel -- Elie Wiesel. The education in
 the information age is to beware of the 
abrogation of civil liberties, of the use 
of computers in the police system -- 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
95
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: -- which can be perverted, and that 
I don™t see as a them
e emerging from the 
Holo caust Museum. They don™t want 
to touch it with a 10 foot pole. 
Q: They want to keep, you feel, to the narrower. 
A: Yeah, they want to keep it as a feeling,
 well this is bad, this is bunch of bad 
guys, and all of those things. To me it is 
much more endemic. It
™s -- it™s the -- the 
state going mad, like in Po l Pot™s 
time, I mean. Like under Mao. 
Q: Mm-hm. Oh, wh ich conceivably canhappen to any society at any time. 
A: Can happen to any society, any time. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And that moral lesson is not visible. 
And you might as well 
tell your sponsors 
that, that I said so. Had 
to get it off my chest. 
Q: You had something further to add. 

A: Yeah. There was no way -- ma -- this 
is my  comme ntary on the tenor and the 
morality of the Holocaust Mu
seum, and the lessons to th
e history. And one of the 
very significant lessons of bureaucratizati
on of genocid e is the extremely small staff 
that Eichmann had in  order to execute mass
ive amount of people. Eichmann and his 
people, in a typical German fashion, were
 methodical bureaucrats first. So when 
Arons -- Ar-Arons says about the banality of
 -- of -- of -- of the crime, he -- she 
really does not get into the analytic mech
 -- mechanism of how this is done. It was 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
96
done, and I™ve studied it, in a very orga
nized, methodical me
thod which leveraged 
the machinery of the state, 
of the police, of the [indeci
pherable] of the judicial 
system, to commit the crime. When you re
ally look at it from a legal standpoint, 
there was no crime. Duly elected -- 
Q: Democratic. 
A: -- democratically elected majority
 people, all voting in favor, in --

Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This 
is an interview with Paul Strassmann, co
nducted by Margaret West, on January the 
8
th
, 2004, in New Canaan, Conn
ecticut. This interview is part of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum™s
 post-Holocaust interview 
project, and is a follow up 
interview to a USHMM videotaped interv
iew conducted with Paul Strassmann on 
July the 11
th
, 1990. The United States Holocaus
t Memorial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making th
is interview possible. This is tape 
number four, side A. Nothing -- you
™re saying that nothing illegal -- 
A: Well, the -- 
Q: -- had occurred. 

A: -- the Holocaust, at least 
the way I witnessed it, with 
the evidence available to 
me, although there were exce
ptions, particularly in the 
conquered lands, where in 
Russia, in -- where there was no legality at al
l, it was -- th-that was just plunder and 
mu r-murder and wh at have you. But I™m 
talking about western Europe, so-called 
civilized western Europe, which includes 
our good friends the French, and -- and -- 
and the Belgians, and the Germans and par
ticularly the Austri
an and the Slovaks, 
and the Hungarians and the Romanian, etceter
a, etcetera, all did that in a very 
methodical, prescribed, legitimate method, wh
ich means that they could argue that 
they were proceeding through the sovereig
n rights of the state to take measures 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
98
which they considered  necessa
ry to defend their social and economic well being. By  
the way, that argument has been made. 
Now, with that structure, and then 
harnessing the power of the stat
e, they were then
 able to execute a crime in a very 
well structured method, which to ok advantag
e of all the best managerial know-how, 
such as being taught in schools today, of
 management. In fact, people get MB As in 

subjects which are closely related to that,except they apply to cattle and apply to 
krispies, and hamburgers and what have you.
 Now, th e evidence fo
r this thing really 
is in what™s called a transaction cost. The transaction costs for executing this crime 
were very low, because this 
was largely self funding. Fo
r instance, the Slovak paid 
the Germans, as you know, 10 marks 
for every body fo r resettlement and 
reeducation fees. The confiscations were 
self funding. Eichmann actually produced 
a profit and loss statement, be
cause through the confiscation 
and so forth, they were 
able to get a large amo unt of
 gold into the co
ffers of their  Reich system, al though 
sooner or later the corruption crept in, but
 nevertheless, it was run as a business. 
The business was base d on the 
fact that a very small number of people at corporate 
headquarters, with some enforcement, coul
d take care of problems which involved 
the marshalling and destructi
on of millions of people. An
d one of the key elements 
in that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations
 in co-opting the 
Jewish organizations into the liquidati
on process. The deportation lists from my 
town, Trencin, that I used to
 trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were

made by the Jewish [indecipherab le], by th
e Jewish organization. The supervision 
and the guidance of, you know
, going to this car, and going to this car, was done 
mostly by Jews with the enforcers onl
ooking except wh en  there were some 
hooligan s who did some stupid things, you 
know, like beat up people and so  forth. 
But most of it was done in a fairly  organi
zed fashion. So now comes the Holocaust 
Museum, and you have a list of Holocaust 
survivors. And then 
you have a list of 
Holo caust survivor donors. And then you 
have interviews with these donors who 
are being aw arded th is or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. And th en you 
have the Los Angeles chapter, and then you
 have the New York chapter, etcetera, 
etcetera. Well, these p eople get up and 
make a speech and they say how they 
suffered in Auschwitz, and in what have 
you. Now it turns out that none of them 
ever give away when 
they went to Auschwitz. None of
 them. They never do. This is 
one thing -- by the -- in many of my inquiri
es, and I will tell you some stories also 

how this [indecipherab le] -- many of these 
people, by innuendo an d implication esp 
-- espe -- especially as to the date of 
the way, how the destruction was done, are 
clearly 1942 inmates. Now please tell me -- 
Q: Oh, because based on putting together
 information from wh
at they™ve said? 
A: Yes. Please tell me how can any
body su rvive Auschwitz from ™42 to -- 
Q: Liberation.

A: -- the spring -- to liberation, which is ea
rly spring of 1945, without being a kapo? 
So the money they™re giving 
is guilt money, it™s tainted 
money, it™s immoral money, 
it™s bad money. And they influence the -- the tenor of what I see -- I haven™t been  to 
the Holo caust Museum now 
fo r about seven years, ma ybe they  changed the 
exhibits. But it is -- the morality
, you see, the morality of th
at thing, which is really 
the underlying issue and the guidan ce for pe
ople to think about 
the future is not 
obvious, or not apparent. It™s
 not even discussed. Now, th
e morality of course, is in 
Yad Vash em, where they have the Righteo us, 
and th-that™s a different thing. But to 
me the Holocaust Museum is -- 

Q: Well, that™s also part of the stor
y told at the Holocaust Museum, is the 
Righteous. 

A: But without the 
morality, that™s -- 
Q: Oh. 

A: -- individual -- you see -- see -- see -- 

Q: I do see. 
A: You see, that gets you in to individual
 psychology of indivi
dual people. Wh en  
you are going to teach about 
the Holocaust, children, and if
 you™re looking into the 
information society of the 21
st
 and 22
nd
 century -- you know, those mu seum has 
ways of staying around for a long time. 

Q: Yes. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
101
A: Something that is the guts of the issue, 
in terms of relevance to the future is not 
there. 
Q: Right. And -- and of course, all the time, 
life goes on and other 
events take place, 
such as the Bosn ian war, wh
ich also comes under the -- 
A: Oh yeah, oh yes, absolutely. 
Q: -- teaching message of the Holocaust Museum  
A: That™s right, that™s right, e-except the Bo snian war is really not analyzed in terms 

of -- in my terms of reference. It was agai
n the state mach inery -- in this particular 
case the military mach inery, which is the most dangerous machinery. See, the 

Germans were much more refined, they 
never used the military for this purpose. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean, the Bosn ians and the Serbs -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- were just very crude. I mean, that™s 
-- that™s -- that™s -- you -- you know, that™s 
very crude. Now -- 
Q: Yes, I see the distinction.  
A: And -- and those are very important, y
ou see, the taxonomy  of genocide varies. 
You have a Mao Tse-Tung, very  sophisticated, harnessing th e young pioneers to 

engage in genocide, but actually mobiliz
ing a section of the communist party to 
execute. Then you have Pol Po
t, okay? Then  you have the 
very interesting situation 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076

in Indonesia. There is a wh
ole taxonomy of different form
s. There is a life form out 
there called genocide, that has a set of indica
tors which should be used as an way of 
alerting society, so that society can distingu
ish it. See, one of -- part of the problem 
with the genocide was that the society in
 ™38 - ™39 did not di
scriminate, did not 
distinguish it, and the Jewish
 organizations were used as
 wayof dist
orting and not 
clarifying what was really happening. We 
knew, for instance, what Auschwitz was, 
what [indecipherable]. The Jewish -- we 
had two people come from Auschwitz, and 
-- 
Q: To your -- 
A: To Slovakia. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. So that was known at the end of
 1943. Had that been
 known and broadcast 
by the Jewish community, more Jews woul
d have taken a different view. They  
didn™t. The thing 
was hushed up. 
Q: Why? 
A: Don™t rock the boat. Keep low. You 
might offend somebody
. So, you know, if 
you really want to listen to Paul Strassmann, my lesson for the Holocaust, I mean, 
there™s a whole different story to be told, in
 terms of its real ev
ents, to the Holocaust 
Museum. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076
 
 
 
103
A: But I™m not sure they want to hear it. 
Q: Mm-hm. Well, we™ve -- this is a small 
way of making sure the story is there. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: In their -- in the archives. 

A: Yeah. The whole taxonomy, structure and 
dynamics of the Ho locaust has to deal 
with going back to 
options. I-I wrote a paper and gave
 a series of lectures which 
were very o -- people were very unhappy ab
out it. I pointed out 
that in 1944, the 
probability of survivin
g the eight month remaining for the remainder of the war, 
mu ch greater if you fought than  if you we
nt to the concen tration camp . In other 
word s, there were two work  camps in Slovakia, one in Sered, one in  Novaky. The 

one in No vaky marched a battalion with a su
rvival rate of 70 percent. Sered was 
done -- run by religio us Jews. Well, maybe 
we™ll negotiate our way, maybe it™s not 
there, maybe we don™t go on this transf
er, maybe we™ll go to the next transfer. 
Always bargaining. See, you 
were bargaining, see the -- 
you were bargaining with 
evil. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: The bargaining with ev
il. There comes a p o int wher
e you don™t bargain with 
evil, you see, because you are out of choi
ces. Because the evil will not give you any 
choices. And so the probability
, the morbidity rate of th
ose was 95 percent. So you 
know, you™re now dealing with
 statistics and with odds, 
and with orientation. You

know, you had six million Jews 
with lots of money in 1938
, let™s go and take a hike. 
You know, we could have gone
 to Madagascar. We could have gone to all kinds of 
other places. Again, I am talk
ing about the survival rates. 
Q: Mm-hm. Well, it™s very interesting. And -- 
A: Well. 
Q: I™d like to thank you. This conclude

Museum interview with Paul Strassmann.
