Q: Could you tell me  a little bit about where did y
ou live in Lodz before the war? Wh at did your 
father do?  What did your mother do?  Just a 
little bit about how well-off you were or poor 
or what was your life like? 
A: I was born in a Jewish Œ a Jewish fa mily, fu
ll of love. I was the only child. My mother, my 
real mother died. I was about three or four 
years old, and my father rema rried. My mother 
was Sima , Sima  Cale also, and my fa ther re
ma rried and her name  was Balcie, and today 
when I think of my mother, I 
think of Balcie. She was a pe
rson extraordinary and gave 
her life for me  during the ghetto and afterw
ards. I don™t speak afte
rwards about it. My 
father worked at the wholesale meat deliv
ery Goscinny Dwor in Lodz. My mother took 
part in home  work. She did work, and we we
re a family, a happy fa mily. We were not 

Page 2
 
rich, but we were not poor. The party in Po
land, Polish Jews were very, very poor people, 
and we were considered rich people. We were
 not rich, but we were considered rich, and 
it was a family, a happy fa mily. I went to school,
 public school.  I wasn™t the best student. 
I wasn™t the worst. I wasn™t the best, and 
so that™s life got till 1939, and then came the 
war, and everything changed by that time . 
The Ge rmans Œ the Germans invaded Poland 
the third of September, and three days later, 
the Polish army left  th
e city of Lodz. They 
came up, swastikas because in L
odz there were very ma ny Germans, and they considered 
themselves as Germans, as Nazis, and three da
ys later, exactly a week the war started. It 
was a Friday, and the next Friday the light we
nt on and we saw that we had lost.  They 
ma de some  t o know wha t ™s going on. In the 
streets they put on a Œ what do you call it Œ 
announceme nts what™s going to happen. So, I we
nt to see. I was 12 years old. I went to 
see what happened, and it was wr
itten like this, ﬁTomorrowﬂ at that  time ﬁthe German 
Ar my is going to enter the city of Lodz, and who ma ke any sabotage or some thing like it 
will be killed.ﬂ Just that, ﬁWill be killed,ﬂ 
and I was a child of 12 years complete. I had 
12 years when it all started. And, 
it was the orneriest 
thing. The first thi
ng I met the Nazis, 
say ﬁGoing to be killed.ﬂ It was such a shoc
k to me  that I came home crying and told my 
father, ﬁThey™re going to kill us.ﬂ  My fath
er said, ﬁNo, people don™t kill people. They™re 
doing it because we were in the war and 
they™re afraid that it™s going to happen, 
some thing to them. So, t hey say going to ki
ll, but no one kills nobody.ﬂ My father didn™t 
believe what is going to happen here. Nobody 
believed it. And, tomorrow, I went to see 
the German army to get in our city. I was ve
ry surprised. It was all motorized and it was 
very good looking, but the same  da
y they took people, Jews in 
the street and hanged them. 
You could get there in the street and see fi
ve, six people hanging. They took Jews. Jews 
by that time used the beard. My grandfather al
so, he was very religious. My grandfather 
was. He wasn™t, but my father Œ my grandf
ather wa s very religious. And, they catched 
him and pulled out his face, never recovere
d, they pulled out his 
beard and he never 
recovered. He was taken out after awhile befo
re the ghetto, and he ju
st disappeared. That 
was the entry of the German ar my, t he We hr
ma c ht, the SS in our 
city. Schools closed, 
and it was all Œ we didn™t know what to do, but 
we were Œ we had to use stars, yellow 
stars of David. We couldn™t get into so me citie
s. They changed the name for Hitler and so 
on. We  couldn™t walk on the sidewalk.  You had 
to walk in the mi ddle of the streets. The 
Jews couldn™t go in movie or streetcars. We  ha
d to go to be separated. We  had to eat. In 
Poland, it gets very cold about Œ very, very co
ld. We had to eat. So, my father was afraid. 
They took people, Jews, took them and they sa
id it™s going to wor
k, but there™s no work. 
They ma ke t hese big ditches, and people had 
to undress, put it i
n, and dance over it and 
sing, and the words were Œ very few came home  
after. So, my father was afraid to just 
disappear. My father was afraid
 to go out. So, I had to go in 
the line to buy bread. I went 
out about five o™clock and four
 o™clock in the morning. It wa
s very cold, very cold, and 
eight o™ clock they came Œ German policemen because this district 
is called Wa rteland, 
and we were attached to the German Reic
h. So, we were ruled by German boss who came 
in German policeman, and usually, almost ever
yday, said, ﬁJuden rausseﬂ Jews, out of the 
line. I didn™t need, by that time, a Star of Da
vid. So, it wasn™t for me . It was just waiting, 
but most of t he time, there was some one who 
recognized me  and said that I™m a Jew. I 
was thrown out, kicked out of the line, and 
came home crying and we didn™t eat that time. 
I know Œ I feel it very much. I don™t hate. I don™t
 hate nor have hate in
 me, but I feel very, 
very m
uch what they did to us.

Q: In May 1940, the ghetto was sealed. Di
d you and your fa mily, your parents and your 
grandparents, did you have to move from your
 apartment or where did you live?  And, 
how did you feel about being in the ghetto? 
A: When they started to speak about the ghetto, 
I didn™t know what it is. I 
asked my father what 
was the ghetto?  And, he told me  that in the 
dark ages there were ghettos, but afterwards 
couldn™t get anymore, but he sa
id, ﬁYou™ll see. We™ll be all 
with Jews and at least we 
have the Germans. We have the Germans. We 
know that they™re our enemies, but at least 
we won™t have the Poles to what they were
 doing with us and beat us up and so on.ﬂ 
AndŒ we didn™t know what™s going to happen. So, 
I went in Œ we went in to the ghetto. I 
lived at Gesia, Gesia 7 apartment 8, and it 
was a good apartment. The house belonged to 
my grandfather. He was a very wealthy ma n. 
We  were not, but he was. And, so we didn™t 
have to move, but my fat her Œ my father work
ed I said in whol esale, retail/wholesale, and 

they called themselves grinszpan. So, I went Œ 
he send me  be cause he was afraid to go. I 
went there and we brought one of the brothe
rs, and he came to our house and lived with 
us for a while. Afterwards, I don™t know how
 it was because I don™t reme mber. He left 
the house. We had a big house, but they we
re Œ people who took part a way to place 
newcomers, we had to give up two rooms for pe
ople to live there. It  was very Œ the ghetto 
had room about 25,000 people to be  there. We  squeezed in 165,000 people in the pl ace. 

There™s room for 25. It was terrible. People di
dn™t know what to do. It was cold, also. The 
worst of all was the hunger. We  didn™t have no food. People started to die because we  

didn™t ha ve no food, and to say what is 
food it™s so hard to say because nobody 
understands what food. You can eat some thing. 
It™s okay, but if you don™t have nothing to 
eat. You don™t see your neighbor. You don™t see 
your parents. One thinking, you think all 
one thing Œ eat, eat, eat and 
you have nothing to put in your 
mouth. People started to die, 
and all over the ghetto there were people 
with open eyes, and you looked at them and you 
thought, ﬁGive me some food and I will get up.ﬂ 
 But they were dead.  The Germans said, 
ﬁIf you ma ke shops and work, we
™ll give you what to do and we
™ll give you food.ﬂ It was 
ma de in a short time , and they started to send me . To live, you need 2,400 calories daily. 

We received 200 calories. It™s a fact that 
people were just who eat no more than 200 
calories can live most eight months. I lived 
five years with 200 
calories. I don™t know 
how I ever survived. I don™t know how. 
Q: Tell me  what did you eat?  Who was in charge 
of getting the food?  What were the ways that 
your parents went about getti
ng some food for the fa mily?  And, what other activities did 
you have?  Did you go to school?  And, what ha
ppened there when the ghetto was closed? 
A: We received a kilo Œ kilo is a two pounds, tw
o pounds of bread. It was dark black and full of 
water inside. Two pounds for five days, and s
oup. They gave us some  vegetables and 
they were old. It was nothing to eat, almo
st nothing. People died. 
That™s why we died. 
And, that was Œ but, they permitted to ma ke 
schools in ghetto. So, we had Œ they called 
them Juden Alteste. Mordechai Chaim Rumkows ki, and he thought that he was the 

emperor of the ghetto, and this emperor opened 
schools. So, I went to school. It was, of 
course, to learn also, but the ma in thing wa
s a soup. You received a soup day. It was not 
the Œ it™s more water than vegetables, but it 
was a soup, and it™s Œ I 
think it™s one of the 
reasons that I survived too. My survival is 
also, I think, because the love I received at 

Page 4
 
home, and I never was beaten up to die. I ne
ve r received a beaten up. They didn™t be at me  
up. That™s why I™m here. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit about school. What did you 
learn there?  Who were 
the teachers? And, who 
were your schoolma tes?  Who we
re your friends in school? 
A: The teachers were the best teachers in the wo
rld. They did everythi ng to
 teach us, and we did 
everything to learn. They were Œ so bad as
 we were, no food, empty stomachs and thats Œ 
they didn™t understand what we say, but we di
d, and they didn™t say what for. They all 
want to die, what for to teach them, but th
ey di d everythi ng to teach us. Today, if I can 
speak, if I™m a person, if I™m a Jew, if I™m 
Brazilian, I belong to humanity, it™s thanks to 
that teachers. In school, we had Œ I had some
 friends. I remember some names, other I 
don™t. It™s 65 years, okay?  I™m 77 years ol
d now, but I still reme mber each time, but 
name s I™ m very bad.  There was a friend of 
mi ne. His name  was Cukier, and I liked him 
very much. He was a friend, real good friend, 
and it™s some thing Œ some thing I want to 
say. We  had in the ghetto, they ma de Œ they ma de a Œ how do I say Œ we wrote to 
Rumkowski. He was the emperor, and we ca
lled the father. The father, it was not the 

father, but we  had to do it. And, we ma de a writing for him t o the end of the year, we 

ma de a writing for him, t o him, and who should 
make it is exactly this
 Cukier, but he was 
so dirty. His hands were always
 dirty and I don™t know. We didn™t have no soap of course, 
but he was more dirty than ot
her kids. So, he started to ma
ke it, and the principal said, 
ﬁNo, you don™t ma ke it. Who™s going to ma ke it is Laks, Cale I mean, and I ma de it, and I 
reme mber I made this writing to the Prezes. We call hi m Prezes. 
Q:  What was the occasion? 
A:  I think it was a New Year it was Rosh Hash
anah or some thing like that. I don™t reme mber 
exactly, but I know it was good because I was in
 the principal™s room. I didn™t have to 
attend school. It was very good for me . 
I liked it and I recognize it now.  
Q: You told me  be fore that before each 
class every morning you 
started with a song. 
A: Oh, yeah. We  started with 
a song. It™s some thing like this 
ﬁ We children beg you oh God, give 
us life and to be pure and good.ﬂ In Yiddish, 
I will si ng it in Yiddish, I reme mber it still 
[sings Yiddish song]. Was the song we sang 
and, afterward, when school™s ended, there 
were no schools anymore. I was in the part 
Œ part of we studied in ghetto without food, 
without nothing, but we studied. 
Q: Tell me  what happene d in October 1940 when you became  13 years old. 
A: Oh, as I said, my father was 
not a religious ma n, but he was a 
Jew. He was proud to be a Jew. 
So, a m I now, and it was time to ma ke Bar Mitzvah. So, I don™t know where it was. I 
didn™t know about it, but in th
e front of our house there was 
a private room, private house 
and they had the Torah there, and I was take
n in there, and I ma de the brachos, and I 
ma de Bar M itzvah, and I don™t know how my fa
ther ma naged to bring some  pieces of 

Page 5
 
bread Œ pieces, not bread, pieces of br ead, 
and all the people there who attend and pray 
got a piece of bread. That was my Bar Mitzvah. 
Q:  After Rosh Hashanah in 1941, the schools were
 closed, and western Jews were brought into 
the ghetto. Could you say a little bit about that? 
A: Before I wanted to say, I went to school
 before the war it was a church. It was on 
Franciszkanska Street, 21 or 20, 19 Œ I don™t 
remember the number, and at that school, 
we were lined up and it was time to have the soup. We  wait with our pots, and came up a 
German and took pictures of us. In 1940, he t
ook pictures, color pict
ures. I found it now.  
I have a picture with my friends in there,
 and I knew about it, 
last year, in 1940 - 203, 
when I came back from Chelmno with all my 
family Œ my family, my parentsand friends 
perished, and the driver took out a xerox and 
showed me . It was me . This picture, the 
original, is now in Frankfurt, the Jewi sh Mu
seum in Frankfurt.  I knew it in 2000, it™s me . 
I mean 2004, we™re in 05 now, 2004 after 60 years. 
Q: Tell me  now a little bit about peop
le that move d into your apartment. 
A: At first there were, as I said, my father™s
 boss and they got out. I don™t know how it was. I 
was too young. There are some  things that I 
know, but I can™t imagine now. I imagine, 
but some times I think like a child. I was a 
child. I was a child. Some  people Œ when I 
speak Œ some people ask me , ﬁ What did you feel 
as a child? ﬂ I say, ﬁI felt like a child, but 
in one day to the other I was grown up.ﬂ They took away my childhood, my youth, and I 

didn™t have it, but I still, I was a ch
ild. And, what was your last question? 
Q: I asked about the We stern Jews who came into the ghetto. 
A: In ghetto, they came in trains with especi
ally fr om Ger many, not only, but especially from 
Germany. They came fr om other parts. I had a 
teacher from Athens, from Greece, but he 
taught me history, and they came trains from
 other parts of Europe especially from 
Germany. They were told they were going to
 be changed for German prisoners of war 
from England. And, whe n they came in, they came with crosses and me dals from the first 
war, and they thought they were going to E
ngland. They came in, they asked, ﬁWhere are 
the ships? Where are the ships here?ﬂ There 
are no ships. And, a couple of elder pe ople 
went into our apartment where we lived. Ther
e were two couples and I reme mber one of 
them had ten Marks, and she kept it ‚til 
afterwards. I don™t know how. I think they 
received Œ they had to go out of the ghetto 
and they were taken, of course, they were 
taken to Chelmno where all people died of 
the Wartegau, and these people also. But, I 
had Œ I had afterwards, I was designed, assigned 
to work at metal as a metaeines as a Œ 
English Œ Slusarz toŒ work in the 
shop. It™s called Metaleines, and- 
Q: When these people who lived in your apartme n
t, when they disappeared, they left, what did 
you think?  What did your father and 
mother tell you?  Where did they go? 
A: We  don™t spoke about it, a little, we spoke ve
ry little of it because before that, Germany 
invaded Russia, and they said that we™re goi
ng to Œ who wants to go with them can go to 

Page 6
 
work in Russia. It™s not hard work. They can
 go, children, the families, or just indi viduals, 
who wants to go to work is going to work in
 agricultural, it™s not
 bad. See here you™re 
dying, but there you can have a potato, grow pot
atoes and that, but you™
ll work, and it™s 
very good job. Many people went out as 
volunteers. And two uncles of mi ne, my 
mother™s two brothers went as volunteers. 
We  know now that all those people went to 
Chelmno, but we didn™t Œ I don™t know. People ju
st believed it. But, anyhow, we didn™t 
have Œ we were not in touch anymor e with
 them, and people started to wonder, ﬁWhy 
don™t they write?  What happens? ﬂ  So, the 
volunteers quit because nobody wanted. So, the 
ma de a sperre, gehsperre, also those people 
who went away, went 
into gehsperre. Nobody 
spoke about it because nobody knew where we
 were going, and that™s why we didn™t 
bother those people who went away also. I 
don™t know. We  don™t 
spoke about it, but 
nobody wanted to get out. So, my father ma de 
a hiding. In Poland, if you come  in, in the 
front of the house, you™ve got doors, and each 
door means a room. If you hide one, you 
don™t have any room. So, my father pushed a 
cupboard Œ my father pushed a cupboard in 
front of the door. So, when they came in there wa s nothing Œ there was no room Œ no 
door, no room. We  went in the bo
ttom of this cupboard and the other room we went in. If 
some thing happened in this room, we went in
 about 13 or 14 people in there. Who made 
it was my fa ther. In the beginning, the Germ
ans didn™t know it, but afterwards they 
pushed the cupboards to see. They were not 
dumb also. So, looked Œ and they told us, 
ﬁ Who™s going to be in the hidingwill be shot on the 
spot.ﬂ They did. So, we went in there, 
and there came  in a child Œ a child of three 
or four months in the same  building. It was 
forbidden, but there was an exception. There 
was a child. And when they came  in, they 
said that they will shoot, and we hear a shot. We have to go down there, and they™ll 

segregate who can stay together and who can
 not. Before that, they took out all the 
children, all the children of 
the ghetto. They took out and 
they said they™re going to 
resettle, but all died in Chelmno. The n, by th
at time , they had children. They were going 
to take children 10 to 12 or 10, 12, and elder pe
ople, but they took others also. They had 
to have 5,000 a day, and if they would not 
have 5,000, they took other who could work. 
They didn™t like it. They didn™t have to. They 
never did what they said.  And, they went 
in Œ this child went in with thei r fa ther  a
nd mother, and all the time they came in and the 
child started to cry. So, this sperre, people star
ted to cover the child with bl ankets and all 
was in his hand, and the child didn™t cry anymor
e. We  were in there Œ we didn™t breathe. 
It was Œ it™s some thing you can™t
 Œ I don™t know how to say it wh
at I felt there. I wasn™t 
standing, didn™t sit. Some body sitting didn™t st and up. We  were afraid to breathe, they 

hear us breathe. I don™t know how long it t
ook. It took Œ every second was ten years, 
every mi nute was ten years. And, afterward, we
 heard outside crying 
and shoots, and then 
people were crying. Afterward, th
ey went away, the child Œ th
e child was dead. My father 
ma ke a mouth to mouth, but the child was dea
d. That time  we were
n™t discovered, but at 
night those couple, the coupl
e with the child went and gave themselves up to the 
Germans. It™s something that marked me to 
the last  day, I think Œ 
I won™t say I lived, but 
‚til the last day, I Œ we be able to think. 
Q:  You me ntioned to me  before
 that at certain points you thoug
ht that sperre was over, and 
you went to get some  soup Œ tell me  about that. 

Page 7
 
A:  They started in the morning. Nobody could get 
out of their room. You ha
d to stay in there, 
and they stopped about five o™clock in the 
evening. We  knew about 
five hours it™s going. 
It™s no more, no more sperre. So, I heard that
 there was a kitchen a
nd they were giving 
soup. I don™t know how, but I know from where, 
but I took a pot and run over there to get 
a soup. I didn™t ask my parents. I just run 
away. I was only a child. I was still a child, and 
I came there. All of a sudden, we were enci
rcled by Germans, by SS, and Jewish police, 
too, and they caught me . I don™t know how. Irun away, went into a house, an empty 
house already, and there was anot
her, my friend from school. Not but that time, but from 
school. We met there. His name was  Woda, and 
we run up to the last floor, and went in 
there. So, I was so naïve. I said, ﬁI™m goingto put a towel in my face and say I™m sick.ﬂ 

But, he said, ﬁNo, don™t do that. Don™t do that. 
Le t™s go in.ﬂ There wa
s a box from coal to 
burn, and we went both. We  went in this box, 
and we stood there, and we heard outside to 
come  out police after us, and so they look 
all over, and when he went away, we came 
home .  Of c ourse my pa rents said, ﬁNever 
do that. Never do this.ﬂ But, what would 
happen?  And, I was with Woda.   
Q: Tell me  a little about your work at theme tal workshop number one. How did you get this 
job?  Who told you to work there?  What did you do?  How ma ny hours a day? 
A: It was a good shop. It wa s a good shop. I learned.
 I was a Œ I learned to be a Œ my job Œ I 
don™t know how to say it, but I had two fore
me n, Brogowski and another one. The other 
one was a Jew from Vienna, very nice people. 
They didn™t beat us, a
nd they teach us how 
to work, and I™m thankful for it. They don™
t live anymore, but they were very good 
people. And, we work 12 hours a day. We  had al
so a soup in this. In this shop, we had a 
soup, and the soup was always so thin, it more 
water than Œ so, we had a song it says to 
get this spoon up to the bottom to take out a 
little ma ybe some  vege
tables or some thing 
like what was in there. And, we had a song it sa
id, it sounds like this [sings Yiddish song] 
to put the spoon down there, and we sung it [sin
gs Yiddish song] let us at that shop, but 
those both people, I™m thankful for what they 
did. The name  of the pr
incipal of the school, 
of that shop was Chaimo wicz. Chaimowicz wa
s a bad guy. He molested girls. He was 
bad.  
[New Tape ] 
 
Q:  Tell me a little bit about th
e school that you attended before 
the war, on Rybna Street, if I 
reme mber correctly, and the school in the ghetto,
 but first talk about the school before the 
war. Did you like going there? Do you reme mbe r
 any name s of teachers? What subjects 
did you learn? 
A:  Yeah, I don™t reme mber Œ that school befo
re the ghetto was a public school. We  had 
subjects, Polish was our language, my  language
 by that time. It™s not anymore, and 
ma the matics, history which I liked very, very 
much, geography. I think 
that ™s all about. I 
don™t think I had anymor e.  We  were young. In
 school, I had good friends, not only Jews , 
but good friends, but some  people were discri
mi nated. Not too much, but sometimes they 

Page 8
 
said, ﬁOh, you™re a Jew. You™re a Jew. You™re 
a Jew.ﬂ But, I didn™t feel it so much.  The 
schools were very good, very good. The teacher
s Œ I don™t reme mber any name  of any 
teacher. I™m very bad in name s and dates, bu
t I reme mber facts what happened. So, in 
school, most of all, afterward we went into 
the ghetto and they st
arted the school in the 
beginning for a few months only, and we had al
mo st the same  subjects, but we had also 
Yiddish. We  had Polish, German. I had a very
 good professor from a German university, 
and it was just beginning. Af
terwards, they brought in Jews from all over Germany, but 
in the beginning, just the beginning they br
ought also Jews from Ge
r many, also, just in 
the beginning, and I had one of those professo
rs.  He was a professor. He was a teacher . 
So, we had German, Yiddish, Polish some ti me
s, not anymore, but who want it Œ and 
history, geography, and some  Hebrew also, some
 Hebrew who want it.  I had very good 
teachers. They Œ I spoke about it. I had the be
st. No, this was afterwards, but I had very 
good teacher. All were ve ry good teachers. So, 
and we were children. We  were children 
and we wanted to eat and it was not so much
 about learning to eat the soup. It was good. 
It was to eat another soup, and my parents, 
of course, were happy that I ate another soup, 
and this was the school. We ca me  home also in school, we had Œ we were not so cold. At 
home , it was very cold. So, I wanted to go to school not so much to
 learn, but to eat the 
soup and not to be frozen. That why. That™s was the school, our school. 
Q:  Did you have gymnastics, sports in school? 
A:  No, we mar ched. We marched. I was assigned to
 be the head of this class. I mean after 
the war. Before the war, no. But, I mean, dur
ing the war. During the war, I was head of 
the class. They called it Gospodarz, land lor
d, but there was no land 
lord, of course, and 
we marched. We marched and we said, ‚A
chad, Shtaim–[Yiddish counting],ﬂ We  
ma rched, and this was in the school. We ma rc
hed, yeah. In that school of Franciszkanska 
where I have  the picture where the German took a pictur e in color. 
Q: Did you play football? 

A: No. We  didn™t play no football. Before the 
war, of course, we Œ but, during the war there 
was no time.  During the war, no. Before 
the war, we played football, yeah. 
Q:  When you started to work after the schools 
were closed, did you have time for any play 
with your friends or reading books or be
longing to an organization of any kind? 
A:  During the war effort, yeah.  We  ha d some
 Œ some  organizations. I was in the Socialist 
organization, Bund, and it was some thing I can
™t say Œ I can™t say it was some thing good 
or bad, but we had no time . I had no time, a
nd not always with people came  together I 
didn™t go because I was too tired. I had to wo
rk 12 hours a day, and one week during the 
daytime, and the other week during the night. 
So, I think I didn™t go because of that. I was 
too Œ I wasn™t lazy. I was tired.  No food, 
I was freezing, and that™s why I didn™t go out. 
Q:  When you were at home with your parents,
 what did you talk a
bout?  Did you ever think 
that it™s going to end, or did you th
ink the Germans mi ght win the war? 

Page 9
 
A:  We were Œ I don™t know why, we believed Œ 
we believed that we are going to survive. 
We thought that it™s impossible to survive,
 but we had a Œ I don™t know why, but we 
believed it. We believed it really that we ar
e going to get out of 
the ghetto and life will 
come  again as it was before the war or be
tter. I don™t know why.  The Germans were 
going up, and we were happy when Germany 
invaded Russia because we thought that 
now it™s going to Œ that the Germans are going 
to lose the war because Napoleon did and 
so on, and so on but it wa s upside down. The Germans went to Moscow, near Moscow, 

near Stalingrad, Leningrad and so on. We
 saw it was not going to happen, but we 

believed it. We believed that we
 were Œ also the Germans stim
ulated us to believe.  The 
Germans stimulated. They said these people 
who went out of the ghetto. They lived good, 
but we didn™t know it.  They believed ever
y time , it was Biebow. His na me  was Biebow. 
He always said, ﬁWe need you, and you go to live because we  need your work, and don™t 

worry about it. People go out, we take, we se
nd to another pl ace. They are replaced, and 

we need you because you are good and you are working and we need you in production. 

And, also this Rumkows ki, I think he knew that  it™s not true, but he always said and ma de 

speeches that we™re going to live. He said, ﬁI br ought you in the ghettoﬂ That™s not true , 

ﬁAnd, I™ll get you out of the ghetto.ﬂ Of course
, it was not true, but always the same . 
They stimulated, the Germans, and the Jewish ghetto Aeltesten. They stimulated us to 
believe that we were to live. 
Q: Were you afraid of the Ge rmans?  Wh o were you afraid of in the ghetto? 
A: I was afraid of everythin
g. All the people were afraid. I was afraid of police, Jewish 
police. I was afraid of Germans. I was afraid
 in the shop where I worked. I was afraid of 
everything. I was afraid I won™t have to eat
 tomorrow. Today, I ate some thing. I didn™t 
know whether tomorrow I will have another so
up, and I was afraid of everything. We  
always lived in stress. We we
re very stressed. All people we
re stressed, and we spoke at 
home, but sometimes we didn™t speak at home b
ecause my father had to work at another 
place, my mother anot her place, I in anothe
r pl ace, and sometimes we didn™t meet at 
home. When we came together, who made all 
the preparations to eat was always my 
mother, and she left each piece for one, my 
father, me , my parents, and we some ti me s 
didn™t speak at all. And, the ev
ening ghetto, we had a theater.
 It was for people, not us. 
People who had some  jobs in the Ghetto-Ver
waltung and so on.  And, this was, I spoke 
about it I was going to see the theater a
nd so on, but people like me , like us, couldn™t 
have it. 
Q:  Where from did you get news?  How di
d you know about Germany invading Soviet 
Union?  Or things not going so well for 
the Germans?  How did you find out about it? 
A:  We had a Œ from Ger man newspapers. We  di
dn™t read the paper as it was written. I™ll 
give you an example. It said, ﬁWe™re goi
ng to fight the communists in Krakow. In 
Krakow, we™re going to ma ke a 
great counter attack in Krak
ow.ﬂ So, we knew it was near 
Moscow. How come  it™s near Krakow? They we
re beaten back, and that we knew. We 
didn™t know that they were goi ng to win Krakow, but they 
we re up there and now they 
were down there.  They were pushed down, and that™s how we knew.  

Page 10
 
Q:  At work, in the me taleines workshop, did pe
ople talk about politics or  military issues of 
how is the war going for the Germans or th
e Russians moving, fighting back, or the 
Allies, the Americans and the British?  Did you know about D-day? 
A:  We didn™t know about British. We  knew
 only from the Russians, Red Army and we 
looked at them as liberators a
nd even after the war, I thought 
that™s true that they were 
liberators and so on. The only hope for us was th
is side, the Russian to come . They ne ver 
came, and we didn™t know about invasion. We
 didn™t know about Americans, the west. 
We knew only this side, the eas
t, the Russian, the Russian ar
my. We  spoke about it, yeah, 
some ti me s we spoke that the Russian woul
d come  and liberate us, and we™ll be good. 
That™s it, but we didn™t know the othe
r side what was going on in the west. 
Q: Did you ever think about running away from the ghetto? 
A: It was impossible. It was impossible to r
un away from the ghetto. I think it™s the only 
ghetto in all Poland, all over the world, 
all over Germany and Europe, that was 
impossible to get out of the ghetto. First of all, we were Œ there were fences, fences, and 
we couldn™t go to the fences. There we re so
me  streets where the fences were people 
couldn™t walk there. I live d near the fence, 
but didn™t go out on the le
ft side. I had to go 
always on the right side inside
 the ghetto to another propert
y and not in the streets. So, 
we couldn™t go in. Afterwards, the Ge rmans t
ook away all Poles, all others on the other 
side of the fence, and they relocated Ge
rmans from Ger many and also Germans from 
Russia. So, I don™t know the distance. There 
were always a German policeman watching 
and inside were Jewish policeman watchi
ng. So, we were isolated completely, but 

completely from all the world. We didn™t know
 what happens on the other side of the 
street. We  knew about, about the Germans going 
to win or lose by the papers as I said. 
But, what™s going on in the city and near 
Chelmno, we didn™t know absolutely nothing, 
and also in the ghetto, this Rumkows ki he ha
d spies. If you said some thing, if he didn™t 
like or invented even some thing, you were taken out and sent, it was called the 
Czarnieckiego. It was a prison, and fr om that 
prison people went out of there. So, we 
didn™t know absolutely nothing. 
Q:  When you still went  to sc hool, how ma ny children were in your class?  
A:  We were about thirty. I thi
nk so twenty or thirty people. 
Q:  At that time at school, did the children
 talk to each other about what was happening?  
How come  you are in the ghetto
?  How come  you™re isolated fr
om the rest of the city? 
A:  No, we were happy in school, very happy in 
school. We  were together. We were between 
friends, and we had good teachers too. The teach
ers simulated to be friends. They were 
your friends, too, I was happy in school, we ha
d soup. They had the soup there. We  knew 
if we come home we ma ybe have a pi ece of
 bread, too, and be tween us we ma rched. It 
was good in school. But we didn™t speak about 
what™s happening. We  didn™t want to 
know. We  were happy in school. We  lived from 
one mo ment to the other. Never in the 
ghetto, we never ma ke plans after the war, y
eah, we™re going to be 
friends Œ but, ‚til the 

Page 11
 
end of the war, we didn™t want to speak about
 it. I was a child, but 
also the adults also 
was the same. 
Q: Tell me  wha t  happened in August 1944. 
A: In August 1944, the ghetto wasbeing finished. They came up to us, and said that we™re 
going to Germany because the Russian army is near, and we™ll be shooted by them as 
collaborators to the Germans because we™re in ghetto, and they™re going to help us not to 

be. So, they™re going to take the ghetto as it 
is with machines and shops and all of us. 
You™re going to Germany to be better in Ge
rmany. Each one will receive to go there, two 
pounds of bread, and there you™ll have German
 money and that would going to be good 
for us to go. We didn™t believe it. So, for 
two or three days, we  were hidden too, my 
fa mily were hidden. And my father said we™r
e going to die here. Le
t™s go. We™re going to 
die. So, we gave ourselves up. We  were take
n to [unintelligible], not far away I lived 
before the wa r and in ghetto, and from there, 
we were taken to a pl
ace. I finished up in a 
place. We  didn™t know where we were.  People in the meantime, I would like to say 

some thing also. That, today, people say that
 they didn™t know what was going on.  Well, 
when we left Poland, I mean ghetto Lodz, a
nd went through to go there, there were 
people working in the fields, and there was a 
woma n there. She ma de a cross and prayed 
for us. So, I said to my father, ﬁYou see peopl
e are praying for us.ﬂ But, after the war, I 
reme mbered that. This woma n, she knew where we going. She ma de a cross to death, that 

we were going to death. So, if she knew all 
the people who were ove
r there knew too. If, 
they knew, the village also knew. If the villag
e knew, also the city knew, and if the city 
knew, all of them knew. They knew and di
d nothing. But on the train, went on, and we 
came in, in a place. They said we had to go out. I 
want to tell a story also
 on that train.  It 
was August, it was not so cold, and we became two pounds of bread, each one finished it 

in two mi nutes, and we wanted to have, to 
drink some thing. They di
dn™t put in nothing.  
In the train I was, a young girl or ma n, we
 all were young, and started to cry, ﬁWater, 
water. I™m dying. I want water, water, wate
r, I™m dying.ﬂ There was no water. When the 
Germans came in, we ha d to give up all we had of value Œ gold, silver, furs, all of it, but 

in that train where I was, a ma n ca me  up with
 a watch, a golden watch, and said to the Œ 
we had in all the trains we ha
d a Œ there™s a window and he said to he, ﬁTake this watch 
and bring wa ter. A person™s dying.ﬂ He took th
e watch but didn™t bring no water.  The 
cries were weaker and weaker. I™m sure that 
person died of thirst. 
The two things that 
marked me all my life Œ the child and that
 person. We  ca me  in Œ we came in. They 
opened up the Œ they were waiting there, and 
my father grabbed for my hand not to lose 
each other. He held me  by my pulse and we
 jumped out the train. They said, ﬁWomen 

one side. Men down.ﬂ I was with my  father
. My father asked they called Kanada, 
Sonederkomma ndo Kanada, and my father 
said, ﬁWhere are we?ﬂ He said, ﬁShut up. 
You™re in Auschwitz. The only way out is th
e chimney.ﬂ And, I thought, before we went 
out, I thought I™m in the Œ where they ma ke 
iron and steel and so, I saw chimney, I said, 
ﬁIt™s a factory.ﬂ But, when we came out, my 
father asked him and he said, ﬁShut up. Shut 
your mouth. You™re in Auschwitz. The only 
way out is through the chimney.ﬂ  And, 
wome n went to one side. It was the last tim
e I saw my mother, and my mother was very 
thin, and I want to tell about my mother
. In ghetto, between one organization and the 

other we could go to a doctor, and the doctor 
gave or not the me dici
ne. The me dicine was 

Page 12
 
a few ounces of bread, and my mother became il
l, and the doctor gave  her. She didn™t eat 
it. She brought it to me . I ate this bread. 
Was my stepmother. She was a mother. My 
mother was very thin, and she died. I looked 
for her after the war a
ll over the world, all 
over the world Œ wrote Red Cross and all thi
ngs because my mother died in the gas 
chamber in Auschwitz, in Birkenau. Right ‚t
il now, I don™t know how
 I survived, but I 
know what for. I survived to be a witness 
and to say all the world that can not happen 
again, never, never again. I do it in Brazil. I 
will apologize also for my English because I 
speak Portuguese, and Portuguese would be muc h better, but I hope people will 
understand, and never again. 
Q:  Tell me  a little bit about what happened th
en with you and your father after arriving in 
Birkenau, and what happened later. 
A:  I was in Birkenau, we were, they took off 
our clothes.  We  were naked, just as we were 
born, shaved Œ cut-off our hair was cut-off.  
And, we were taken, my father asked, yeah 
inside they took a part to the 
left and the other part to the 
right, beating us. We separated, 
one on one side Œ one part on one side, other pa
rt. The one part we were not, they asked 
them to get their sleeves up and tattooed, ma
de a tattoo with a number.  So, we Œ my 
father thought they going to take us because
 we were not tattooed, and my father said 
they™re going to take us to the gas chamber,
 but we didn™t. They took us to a block and 
they Œ we were sold, sold as slav
es to build a Œ what do you call it?   
Q:  Trenches? 
A:  Trenches also, but to ma ke- 

Q: Gastanks? 
A: Tanks,yes. 
Q: Anti-tankreinforcements. 
A: We were sold to ma ke the jobs, and I 
want to tell you Œ to tell you also about what 
happened to me  in Flossenbürg, I mean in Birkenau. I was standing to get the soup, and 
they came up a Kapo and said to me  that I™m 
for the second time  taking soup. I wanted to 
say some thing, he said, ﬁShut up. You™re in
 Auschwitz. The only way out is through the 
chimney.ﬂ Come, [Ger man]. It means to get 
beaten up with 25 la
shes, and I don™t Œ I 
know only one person who survived 25 lashes. My father saw it. He wanted to say 

some thing. I said, ﬁDon™t talk. Don™t talk.ﬂ I was 
afraid they were going to take my fa ther, 
too, and he went to kill me . I don™t know why 
he didn™t kill me  on the spot, but why he 

took me. So, I started to march. He kicked 
me  some ti me s. I don™t know where I was. In 
came another one, a friend of his, and said to him,  ﬁCome I want to show you 

some thing.ﬂ So, he said, ﬁ What I going to do with this?  I™m going to finish him.ﬂ He s a id, 

ﬁTake out, take another, you have so much wh
at do you need him for.ﬂ So, he went with 
him. He kicked me right here march zuruk. My
 father didn™t believe that I came  back.  I 

think I was Œ I don™t know why I survived. I 
was dying. He took me  there to kill me , and 

Page 13
 
I came back. So, afterwards, we were sold as
 I said to another camp, and this camp of 
course belonged to Gross Rosen. The camp 
Œ the name of the camp was Kaltwasser, 
Kaltwasser. This camp was a littl
e be tter because  they didn™t beat us. They did beat us, 
but not so much. At that camp, in the better
 camp, work was hard, and food was the same , 
but they didn™t beat so much. The only thing 
they beat because it was cold and we were 
working with cement, and we took some  paper to
 put in Œ it was so cold Œ to put enough 
in the feet, so cold. And each person who was cat
ched with this at ni ght, they™d beat us 

up. We  had numbers. We gave us numbers,
 also, but not tattooed, but we had on our 
clothes, and our uniforms, we had numbe
rs. At that camp, they came once and took 
youngsters, I was in it, took youngsters to stay aside. They came  out one of them. I t hink 

he was a dentist. He took me  in, took me  out
 of this bunch of where we were. Took me in 
their quarters, and pulled me  out a tooth. He
 said, ﬁI™m going to pull you out a tooth, and 
you ma y cry if you feel some thing to cry 
over, just  go ahead. Nobody will hear you.ﬂ 
Anyway, and without anesthetic
, without nothing, he pulled out a tooth. I wanted to stay 
up. He said, ﬁSit down. And, now if you yell, do
n™t breathe in because I™m going to take 
out another tooth, and if you cry or so me th
ing, I kill you right now.ﬂ And, pulled me out 

another tooth, two teeth. I don™t know why. From
 this one, it became five because I used 
a hook, and spoiled. I make implants to this si
de, and here I have 
a bridge. He took me 
out five from this side and th
ree on this side, in that better
 camp, we ma de ditches, and it 
was raining so much that night. It was horri
ble, and the guards th
ere were well guarded 
rubber. There was no plastics by that time. With
 rubber, they were dry, and he said, ﬁHey, 
Jew, bread.ﬂ He said a little bread. I pulled ou
t of the trench, and put this in my mouth. 
Other people saw some t hing, I don™t know how. 
I heard shooting, but people fell on me , 
and I was offered but the bread I had in my
 mouth. When they took out my beating, I 
don™t know. I got out this same  soldier, the 
same  SS was near me , looking at me . I knew 
if I would run or some thing, he would kill me . So, I stood up, put my head down, 
couldn™t look at the Germans. It was forb
idden. So, I stood. He with his gun, he hit me  
here. It™s still here. Until today,I don™t breathe with this side. 
I breathe this side.  This is 
Nazi. The name  of the camp was Lärche. Th
ese youngsters, I received a little time ago, I 
received from Poland a book who said exactly
 what I™m Œ not about me , but about the 
youngsters that all these people who went Œ who 
were taken out of this camp, were sent 
back to Auschwitz and they all gone, all 
was exterminated in Auschwitz, and it was 
some thing. It was a blessing that he took me  
out and pulled my teeth out. If not, I would 
not be here. There™s so ma ny co
incidences, but I think that God wanted me  to be here. I 
think it™s God. I don™t know. Afterwa r ds, 
we were taken out from Lärche. It was 
Kaltwasser and Lärche. When I was in Kaltw
asser, we had to build Lärche. And, we 
build Lärche, and we belonged to a Gross Rose
n. We  were taken Œ they took us to death 
ma rch, and at that time  was almost end of the 
war. My father said to me , ﬁI want you to 
promise me  son.ﬂ I said, ﬁOf course, what 
do you want father? ﬂ  He said, ﬁTo see the 
war™s going to end. The Germans look like the 
Polish Army in ‚39. One runs forward, the 
other runs back, and if they won™t kill us, 
you will survive. And, I want you to do a thing. 
If you survive, never let people forget what 
happened to us. Always
 tell what happened. 
Maybe some people won™t get out in their head
 that some thing so terrible could happen, 
but you alwa ys say and tell what happene
d, no ma tter Œ young, old, ma ny, few Œ always 

say it.ﬂ I promised my fa ther I would. He 
said to me , ﬁ Now, my child. I™m going to sit 
down because my feet don™t Œ can™t go on anymore.
ﬂ And, to get out of the Œ to be to not 

Page 14
 
go or sit down, they killed. We  went out from 
there, we went out 600 prisoners, and at the 
time, my father fell, we were about 50 or 60. Th
ey killed all of us. My fa ther said, ﬁI™m 
going to sit because my feet Œ my fe et don™t Œ 
over there.ﬂ I said, ﬁFather, if you will sit 
down, I will sit down too. I don™t want  to li
ve without you.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, you have to 
walk. You have to go. You have to survive 
because I don™t wantﬂ Anytime he me nti oned 
to stop or some thing, I stopped with him, and 
ne ar us, we were al
ways in five. So, a 
person Œ I don™t know who it is, he didn™t surviv
e. I™m sure. He said, ﬁYou want your son 
to live.ﬂ He said, ﬁOf course. The only thi
ng, I™m going to die. I™m dying.ﬂ ﬁSo, put your 
arm on me , and one arm on your son, and we™ll 
fa ll down all the three of us.ﬂ He was in 
very bad shape too, but we fall down. My fath
er said, ﬁThey™ll shoot us. They don™t allow 
it.ﬂ He said, ﬁPut your arm Œ put your arm on 
us. Let™s go.ﬂ And, my father after he put 
one hand on his and one on my shoulder and we
 went, and it was a mi racle. All of a 
sudden, we had a train from nowhere. There 
was a train, and our co
mmandant went over 

to the ma n who was in it. There was nobody in it, 
just a train, just onl
y the driver, and we 
went into this train, and we came to Flossenbür
g. In Flossenbürg, we were in Block 25, in 
quarantine. It was one of the Œ the worst in
 Fl ossenbürg, and the Kapo killed my father 
there because  he went in and it was cold and 
my father couldn™t go anymore. So, he went 
in and he call latrina, and in there he kill
ed my father. I asked some  people, we shouldn™t 

push if some one died, we had to stay in same  place where he di ed. They could say, ﬁGet 

them in. Get them out.ﬂ But, they asked people to push my father 
and they attended me , 
and pushed him in Block 25, and my father was 
dead.  I saw all the lice getting off his 
head fr om him. I knew that my father™s dead. He shared the same fate with six million 

Jews. My father had 45 years, 45 years. He
 was a good ma n. He was not religious, but 
good, respected, respectful, a good person, but he
 died because he was a Jew with 45 
years. I had about 17. My father, the cremat
orium in Flossenbürg didn™t work anymore. 
He was burned outside the camp, outside near 25
th
 block, quarantine in Flossenbürg. He  
was burned out there and I saw it. A few days 
later, I was taken to be drown in south 

Germany in Bodensee, to be drowned because came a cable from Hi mml e r to 

Flossenbürg. My boat, I rowed a boat and I ha
ve the facsimile in Portuguese of course, 

and they said that no pr isoner should fall in th
e ha nds of the Allies, and I was there to be 
killed. In the meantime, it was there. I di
dn™t know where I was. We  were bumped. I 
don™t know by the English or Americans, and at 
night we had to get 
out of the train, and 
at night we were taken to 
another train to go on, and in the meantime we stopped in 
Offenburg. This town was bombed, and we had to
 clean it, but a few time, a little time, 
they take me  in the train where we were bombe
d, as I said. And we went in this town of 
Tutlingen. We went into Tutlingen at nigh
t. I don™t know how Œ why, I mean I don™t 
know why, the train started to move, and we 
stopped in another train Œ another station 
called Emmendingen, and at Emme ndingen, I was 
dying.  I wa s sittin™ there. I knew I was 
dying, and I was in peace with myself. ﬁI™m going 
to die.ﬂ I knew it. I di dn™t feel no fear. 
I didn™t fear anymore. I didn™t hurt. Pain, just
 a little in my feet, because they were 
swollen, but I was sitting th
ere in the train, they came 
up, and I heard outside some  
shooting and then lights, but it wasn™t at me . 
I stood there. I was there with my, they call 
a blanket, and I was tired. Ca me  over to me
 a person, and spoke in some  language I don™t 
know, it was Greek, I don™t know what they sai
d, and came back with a Œ with some milk 
and gave it to me , but I couldn™t lift my hand anymore. So, he pushed my  head back, and 

put this milk in me . And, I have a son. He
 is a doctor. He is a doctor now. He said, 

Page 15
 
ﬁFather, you had to die by that time.ﬂ 
I weighed Œ my weight was 56 pounds with 17 
years. I was dead. I was dying there, really 
dying. He said, ﬁYou had to die like that.ﬂ I 
didn™t eat. I don™t know how long I 
didn™t eat, and all this stu
ff. ‚The milk should kill 
you.ﬂ But, I felt better. I got up. Got up, and 
they came Russians too said the Germans 
run away. We are free. We  are free now.ﬂ Bu
t, for me , it was Œ I don™t know. I didn™t feel 
nothing. But, I went into a train where the Germ
ans were before. I could sleep there. So, I 
lay down there, and the French. 
I was awake by French. They left us as we were when we 
Œ garbage, they ask nothing Œ what happened. Who we are, they knew, but they didn™t ask, 
didn™t bring food, didn™t bri
ng a doctor, didn™t bring a nurse, nothing, nothing, nothing, 
nothing.  We waited few days afterwards, they ca
me  back said they goi
ng to retreat. Who 
wants to go with them can go, but they don™t ha
ve any trucks to ta
ke us. I couldn™t go a 
yard. I couldn™t go ten miles, twenty miles. 
So, I didn™t get up. I was dead. The next day, 
the Germans came back, and I was taken with
 others who also couldn™t go. We  were 
taken to be shot. When we came in near wh
ere they wanted to shoot us, there came a 
priest , a fi rer and two civilians, and said to Œ 
it was an offi cer Œ they told him, ﬁIf you kill 
these people and the French come  ba ck, we will be responsible for it.ﬂ They did nothing. 

So, leave them because of us.  And, they didn
™t say it™s not allowed to kill. They gave 
him a reason why because they will be  responsible. They took us in the school, and 

afterwards they were shooting and when we 
got out there were white flags and there was 
bread the second time. Sixty years ago, last
 year, was January 2004, I went to Germany, 
Poland and Germany, to see all this I™m telling 
you. All this, I saw it again, and I went to 
Emme ndingen and spoke to the ma yor of the 
city Emme ndi ngen, and he has it all written 
down with dates. I don™t know dates, but he 
did. I™ve got it home  in Brazil. I have it 
written down all this. I read a book and I showed 
hi m what Œ this is this but without dates, 
and it™s exactly the same. 
Q:  I want to go back a little bit to the ve
ry beginning of the ghetto when you realized that 
you were going to be fenced up some  little area
. You were so called lucky that you didn™t 
have to move because you stayed in your own apartment with your parent s, but what was 
the feeling of being fenced in, of being 
separated from the rest of the world? 
A:  In the ghetto we were fenced in. It was a 
feeling of loses. We  lost everything. We  were 
not human anymore. We were put in like ca
ttle in a place where there was room for 
25,000, we were squeezed in 165,000, and it was so
me thing like to take out at night some  
person and put them in the street. We  have all, even us, we were in the ghetto we were 
lucky not to leave the home , but
 we a ll Œ all we had before the war, but we felt the same . 
We felt the same  because we were afraid 
of invasion. They came  in some  people and 
took it. Just went in and we 
want to stay here, and we are afraid that more people are 
going to come . We wer e  afraid. You couldn™
t say no. Of course, you couldn™t say no. Go 
in, get in, and that™s it. They did so. They 
didn™t ask, and we didn™t say no. I was a child, 
but my parents Œ my father said it™s okay. We
 don™t need so much room. And, just it was 
some thing. I really don™t have words to say 
what we felt. People were sleeping in the 
streets, in the street
 and it was raining. 
Q:  Tell me a little bit about the apar tment. When you entered there was a separate kitchen, 
and was there a bathroom? Was there a toilet? 
Wa s there running water in the apar tment? 

Page 16
 
A:  No, no, no. We had Œ the apartment wasn™t
 a new one. We  had th
e toilet, you had to go 
out. We  had to go down, and there was a toilet
 separate in the yard, and we had three 
rooms, sleeping rooms. One was mi ne separate
. We ca me  in the kitchen, from the kitchen 
there was a dining room, and we had three r
ooms  Œ one was my parents™, one was to hold 
some  things that my father had, that my 
parents had, and my  room separate.  And, all 
those rooms were taken by Œ about the toilet,the toilet was down there just for the whole 
building. There was no running wate
r in the house. We  had to go pick it up in a pump, 
and to take it in. And, the toilet in ghett
o, there wa s a Œ there was a barrel. They put it 
lying down, ma de a hole in the mi ddle, and took 
out all this thing from people left there, 
put it in this barrel. This barrel was taken 
to Marysin, and there it was emptied and came 
back to take others.  Those people usually we
re families who put it, and they received a 

little more bread. These people basic cal
led scheisszkomma ndo. The schiesszkomma ndo 
were happy because they got a little more brea
d, and this was our house. It was very good. 
It was very cozy, but it wasn
™t very modern. It was very
 good. We  lived good. As I said, 
my father, they looked at us as rich people. We  were not. 
Q: Tell me  about the geography. You said that your
 street, Gesia Street, was near the fence. 
How far away was it from the bridge?  And, 
how often did you have
 to go through the 
bridge to the other side of the ghetto? 
A: The bridge Œ to cross the br
idge Œ I wa nt to say, the ghetto 
was three parts, and from one 
part to the other they ma de a bridge, and that 
bridge took from one part to the other.  In 
the beginning, I worked in the Nazi shop. I wo
rked in me taleines, but it was not in the 
same  place where it was later on. We moved. They ma de it bigger and better and to go 

where I lived, I had to go it was 
quite a while to go. It was not so
 near, but it wasn™t so far, 
and I had to cross the bridge and to go on th
e other side to ghetto, Nowomi ejska, I mean 
Zgierska, and so I had to cross it each day 
two time s. That™s also where doors to open Œ 
we had door and the bridge. Some  people went through the bridge, and some  people went 

through the door, but the door was opened not 
always. It was opened sometimes because 
the street cars between one part to the other, there were street cars with Ge rmans and 

Poles who went from one  place to the other.
 In the beginning, I had two times, two times 
a day, to work and back. And, afterwards, I liv
ed near the plant, n
ear metaleines. So, I 
didn™t have to go far, it was near. I was now
 in Poland, in Poland. It™s some thing else. 
Q:  I have two questions Œ one was it scary to go through the brid
ge?  And, if so, why? 
A:  No, to go to the bridge was not scary. I™m 
not scared to the br idge because I just through, 
it, and there was nobody had to be scared abou
t it.  We  were always scared. We  were 
scared. We  lived scared. We were scared, but 
to cross the bridge didn™t scare, just cross 
the bridge. 
Q:  Tell me  did you ever see Biebow?  Did you m
eet him?  Did you see him in the street, or 
did you never ma ybe you never saw hi
m, but just knew about him?  
A:  Biebow I saw once. He came to ma ke an 
inspec tion in metaleines. He want always to 
look where people were working 
and so, but he came  to me taleines. He came  in where I 

Page 17
 
worked and asked Œ didn™t really ask me , but
 he asked the other people if they have 
enough to eat and it they feel good and how f
eel, and that™s all. But, we were, but 
Chaimo wicz said if he, always, if he aske
d some thin™ say always, you™re good. You feel 
good. You have food. That™s all. And, the pe
rson he asked answered exactly what was 
told to do.  
Q: Was Biebow a person that you were scaredof more than, let™s say Jewish policeme n? 
A: We were scared of all of it. We  were s
cared of Jewish policemen. We we re scared of 
Biebow. We  were scared of Rumkowski. We
 wer e  scared of Sonderkomma ndo. We were 
scared Œ alwa ys we were scared. It wa s no mo
re or less, but we were Œ we had more, we 
were more afraid more for policemen than
 from Biebow. Biebow didn™t come . He came 
one time, but the police you had it 
the time. So, we were afraid. 
Q:  What were you afraid of that  what would the police do to you? 
A:  To take us Œ to take us for nothing. To 
take us to Czarnieckie
go. We  were afraid the 
policemen just to take us, so on, take us out of the ghetto. 
Q:  Tell me  again why if you believed that 
they™re taking people for 
work, why not to go?  
Why avoid it? 
A:  We didn™t want to go out of the ghetto ev
en we believed they going to work. We  didn™t 
go out because some had family. For instance,
 both of my uncles they went out of the 
ghetto. They wanted to eat. They told them 
they were going to Russia to work. So, went 
out. But, for instance, if I would be a 
grown-up person, I wouldn™t go out because I 
wanted to be with my mother and my father. 
My father wanted to be with his wife and 
me , and my mother wanted to be with he
r husband. That™s why. People wanted to go. 
Some  went. ﬁNo, I™m going out because I want to 
live. I want to eat better.ﬂ But, mos t  of 
us didn™t want to go. ﬁHere I know it™s bad. Maybe I™ll die, but I™ll die here. Why should 
I go look for better or worse?  I™llstay here.ﬂ That™s the reason. 
Q: Did you know what was Biebow™s function?  
What was his responsibility? What was he 
doing with the ghetto? 
A: We knew we had of Biebow, we knew very li
ttle. We  knew he was th
e gaulieter. He is 
the head, and he is above Krippo. We had a 
Krippo Œ criminal police. We  had a Krippo. 
We had a Gestapo, and also Jewi
sh police, also in the same  
style. The Jewish police was 
in the same style as the Germans. And, Bie
bow himself, he didn™
t expose himself. We 
didn™t know very much about him. He was the 
head, of course, but we didn™t. After the 
war, we saw pictures. I saw pictur
es. I knew what really happened. 
Q:  Was it clear to you and your parents that 
it was these were the Germans who are ma king 
your life so difficult in the ghetto? Or di
d you blame the Jewish Admi nistration Œ 
Rumkowski, the police? 

Page 18
 
A:  About who we blamed, we blamed both of
 them. The Germans, because they wanted to 
annihilate us. They wanted to kill us 
all. And, the Jewish police, the Jewish 
admi nistration we blame d for some  errors 
they did. For example, the Germans sende d 
flour to ma ke bread. So, he didn™t ma ke bread, 
and it to the people to eat. He ma de bread 
put it away and said there it will be harder 
times than now, and the bread they had to 
throw it away and we didn™t eat it. He could do 
it. Potatoes Œ they send so little, but this 
little di dn™t come  to us. People died because of
 Rumkowski with his a
ll errors. They sent 
potatoes.  Instead to give it to the people, eat,
 two, three, five potat
oes. No, he ma de holes, 
put it in Marysin, put holes, put straw and bur
ied it, and it spoiled. They bored of them. 
What the Germans didn™t, the Jewish admi nistration did. 
Q:  Many of survivors of the Lodz ghetto feel
 that more people survived from Lodz ghetto 
than from any other ghetto. 
What do you think about that? 
A:  About survivors from Lodz 
ghetto. It™s not true . We were put
 in Œ we were squeezed in I 
said, 165,000 people. In the end of ™45, when we were taken to Auschwitz, we were in 

ghetto 70,000 people still, but
 those people who were in ghetto, there were 70,000 

between them, there were only 1,500 people who went in with these 165,000.  All died 

from hunger, from Chelmno, and fr om so on.  It™s not true.  From ghetto Lodz who came 

in out of the ghetto we had 1,500. Today, 
people all over around Lodz, you ask where 
you been, ﬁLodzﬂ. They not Lodz. Lodz is a 
state, and the oldest state Lodz.  Some  
people went through Lodz also, but in Lodz 
where I was born in Lodz, raised in Lodz, 
lived in ghetto Lodz. In ghetto
 there are others also, but 
they™re not from Lodz. From 
Lodz, and they don™t know. They came in 
the end, and they were 70,000 people with 
them. From the 165,000 who went in the ghetto, 
when the ghetto was liquidated, finished, 
only 1,500 people, and this people could be more
. If it would be better admi nistrated and 
so I don™t know. I don™t think that he was right
 because if you want some one to be bad, 
give them power, and that was him. 
Q: I™d like to ask you now about October 1941 
after the schools closed, and the western 
Jews came i n. You told us before that two el
derly couples lived with you in the apartment, 
but did you meet other children, German speaki ng children that came from Berlin or from 
Vienna or from Prague ma
ybe?  Did you meet them?  Did you know them?  Did you play 
with them, talk to them? 
A: Who ca me  in the ghetto Lodz were no 
children, not youths. They were only elderly 
people, and most of them were decorated by th
e first World War, and they believed, as I 
said, they believed they were going to be
 changed for Ger man POWs. There were no 
children. There were on
ly elderly people. 
Q:  That you me t? 
A:  Right, there were no children. I me t in c
oncentration camp aft er the ghetto. I met some  
from Austria, from Œ youth, children from C
zechs and from Hungary, from, all this but in 
the camps, but not in ghetto. In ghetto, 
there were no children, 
only elderly people. 

Page 19
 
Q:  Did you and your friends, your fa mily some ho
w blame the German Jews or the Austrian 
Jews that came in and because of them 
the school was closed?  Did you ma ke this 
connection that because they came, the school wa s closed? 
A:  When the Germans ca me into the ghetto, 
we just ignored them. 
I don™t know why, but we 
just ignored them. It wasn™t because they were
 better or worse or they want to take our 
place or  something like that. People don™t know
. Ignore them, people. They came in, in 
our house. They thought that the Germans and 
we are Poles. We were Jews, and they 
were Jews, but it was no Œ between us
, nobody hate, nobody. You™re a German, okay, 
you™re a German Jew, but we didn™t blame the m, of course not. But, people ignored them. 
Q: Could you communicate with th
em?  Could you talk to them?  
A: Yeah, yeah, of course. My father spoke ve
ry good German. So do I. My mother too, in 
our home was spoke Polish, and we had a lo
t of books. When the Germans came in, my 
father burned books. German books in our house, 
and they came  also Lichtenstein from 
another, Luxembourg, ye ah, they came from Luxembourg and we were friends Œ younger 
people. There came some younger people. We  we
re friends, but olde
r one looked at us 
that we were Poles and they were Germans. Th
at™s why. From the other parts, it was very 
good. There was no diffe rence between us. Th
ey died just the same  way we did. 
Q:  Sir, anytime  you want to start. 
A:  All those years, I was looking 
for that piece of paper Œ it™s no
t just a piece of paper, it™s 
some thing I wrote when I was 13 years old. I™m 77 now, and I found it. I™m so excited 
about it that I don™t know what to say. Of cour
se, it™s written in here
, it™s all a lie. We, it 
says, ﬁWe little children are grateful for you 
our fatherﬂ is Rumkowski ﬁbecause you took 
us out from the dirt and gave us cleanness th
at we now can breathe 
fresh air.ﬂ And so on. 
It™s a lie. It™s a great lie, but I remember th
at at that time  I had 
to do it because I had, and 
I was a little boy, and today I know it what ha
ppens here. And I™m very, very excited to 
see after those years something I made when 
I was twelve years old, thirteen I me an.  
Q:  [Background talking] 
A:  When the album was ready for Rosh Hashan
ah, we ma de it for our father Œ our father, 
and all the children had to sign it. I made the al
bum. I wrote it, but all this students had to 
sign it. It™s also my signature in here, and 
after those years, I f
ound it out, and I would say 
it™s a plea sure . Yeah, it™s a pleasur e. They want
ed to kill us all. All of them were killed, 
but they forgotten one, and I™m a witness ofwhat happened, and I got my signature right 
here with all my friends, my friends. All of
 them I liked. Was C
ukier. He should have 
written it, but he couldn™t. I did it. After those years, I™m here. Cukier, I™m here. 
Q: [Backgroundtalking] 
A: On Rosh Ha shanah- 

Page 20
 
Q: Go ahead sir. 
A: On Rosh Ha shanah, we ma de an album to 
give to our father Ru
mkowski, father, and I 
wrote it. It should be Cukier 
who should ma de it, but I did 
it, and after those years, I 
found my si gnature in here.  All the boys, we
 were together, all my friends. I™m sure 
nobody lives anymore, but I found my signature 
in here, and all those are my friends. 
They all live in me , all live in me , and I 
am here. The Nazis killed si x million, six million. 
1,500,000 children, but I am here. I am here. 
Q:  Mr. Laks, Anytime you™re ready. 
A:  In 1940, right after closing the ghetto, th
e Germans permitted schools, a school, and I was 
one of the children who went to school. Thispicture was taken at Franciszkanska. I don™t 
know whether 21 or 19. The buildin
g is still there, but we were a class, our class of 
children, and I was the head. I wa
s the best. Of course, I wasn
™t the best student, but for 
some  reason they picked me  out to be the h
ead. And, by that time, there was a German Œ I 
don™t reme mber his name  Œ he took pictures 
in 1940 pictures, colored pictures, and I am 
in that picture. That™s me  over here. 
That™s me . That picture, that™s me .  
Q:  [Background talking] 
A:  In 1940, the Germans allowed schools in ghe
tto, and there was open class school in the 
church of Franciszkanska, 21 or 19 I don™t re
me mber the number, but I was in it. The 
ma in reason to go there was not so much to l
earn as to have another soup. We  see here 
children with pots to get a little 
soup, we got the soup there. In 
this picture, I am too. That 
is me , here. In 2004, I was back to see it, and 
the building™s just the same , and here I am, 
here. Also, it ma de the Œ I don™t know for the some  reason Œ this little boy here, my friend 

of course, I don™t know who it is. He has a ha
t from a Jewish policeman. It™s something. I 
don™t know why.  Also, my friends have stars,
 yellow Stars of David, but I don™t have a 
star. I don™t have a star because I 
was not 12 years old by that time. 
Q: [Backgroundtalking] 
A: After ma king the album, and we were sent to
 take it to Rumk owski, to our father, and I 
don™t reme mber well what was happened in ther
e, but that is my picture here. Exactly 
here, that™s me , over here. I found it now. I™m 
gr ateful to have it. I don™t think it ma kes 
any difference, but for me it does. Here I am, 1940. 
Q: That™s it.
