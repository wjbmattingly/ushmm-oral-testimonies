Susan, thank you somuch for joining us today andf or being will ing to be our
 
F i rs t  
Person
. W e have justan hourfor you to cover a whole lot of territory, many years.  S
o  we ' ll 
ge t sta rte d. 
 
 
Your early years were spent living in the town of  BadKreuznach inGerm any.  
Bef ore we talk about your experience during the Holocaustand what you went through tellus, 
f irst, what you canabout yourf am ily, yourself, your comm unity
 
in those years before 
Kristallnacht, before war was on the horizon andbegan. 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, Hitlerf irst cam e intopower in 1933. I was a very young girl.  I 
really didn't understand what Nazism  was all about. I was 
a 
very happy little gir
l.  W e live d  in  a  
nice house.  Andm y father hada linen store. He providedfor thef am ily.  I was happy.
 
 
All of  a sudden, after 1933, m yf ather didn'thave his storeanym ore. W hat I f ound 
out later on, the Nazis boycotted his store.
  
All of  a sudden we
 
couldn't afford to live in our 
house anymore, so we kept m oving to a lower and lower econom icarea, intoa very sm all 
apartm ent. It was all because m yf ather eventually lost his store becausehe didn't have any 
business. T he only people that were allowed to shop in his store were the Jewish people,but 
theother people wouldn't buy anything.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know if your parentsexplained to you, knowing you were ver y young, 

what was going on, wh y you had tom ove to differentplaces, why he didn't
 
have his business 
anym ore?

>> SusanW arsinger:  I was ver y young.  I think m y parents always tri ed to protectus. They 
didn't tell me about it. I guess m yf ather thought m aybe the Nazi go vernment was going to 
blow over.  Ever ything, we just knew that wecouldn't afford allof  these things.  
 
 
My f ather started
 
--
 
when he didn'thave his store anymore, he started to sell 
strawberries and blueberries and 
b
lackberries in thesebig basketsto thepeople who wereour 
neighbors.  That's how he
 
--
 
>> B ill B e n s
o n :  In effect, go i
ng door
-
to
-
doorselling f ruit, cherries and things.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e one tim ethat
 
you would
 
know if  youhad had a goodday selling 
the cherries or blueberries. 
 

>> SusanW arsinger: Oh, yeah. W e h
ad
, 
lik e
,  
a signal
 
--
 
we had asignal.  If  he raised two 
f ingers, itmeant thathe had sold two baskets and made a certainam ountof m oney.  Andeach 

of  hisf inger signs we had this little thing 
between
 
us. If elt very close to my f ather because he 
in c lu d
ed me inthe econom ics of ourfam ily.  Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littlebit about your early education.  AsI recall, you recall your ver y 
earliest years as being unhappy in school.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah, Idid
. 
 
I  ha
ted going to school.  I was
 
in
 
f i rs t  grade
 a
nd the children 
m ade fun of  m e.  T hey called m e nam es.  T hen I f inally realized they called m e nam es 
because I was Jewish.   SoI was happy oneday because they said you can't go to public 
school anym ore.  So I didn't have to go to school b
ecause all the Jewish children in Germany 
at that tim e were notallowed to go to public school. I was ver y happy.

But eventually we started a one
-
room  schoolhousefor the Jewish children inour 
town.  There were not too m anyf am ilies living in the town. 
 
So we had one teacher.  T he 
room
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Formultiple grades.  Right?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Multiple grades. The room was sm aller thanthis auditorium . Thef irst 
grade sat in thef irst row
, t
he second grade in the second row
, a
ll the way to the 10th grade.  
And that teachertaught all of those children andm etall of their needs.  And I really loved it 

because I was comfortable thereand nobody calledm eany nam es.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e about an incident that really left an impressionon you where your 

m other sent you to a local store to getbread. T ell us about that. 
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  I felt very im portant. T his little kid.  Sheused to put this in m y handand 

said g
o  t o t he  s t o r e a
nd buy the breadfor the fam ily
 
or som etim es itwas bulk or sometim es it 
was som ething else. 
 
 
Can everybody hear me ok?  T he people in the back row, can you raise your hand 
to letm e know that you can hear me? Ok. Iwant to make sure that I speak loudenough.
 
 
Anyway, so she said go tothe storeand buy this loaf of bread.  So in order to go to 
the store
 
--
 
I lived here. T he grocery store wa s like onthe end of the row over there.  It was 
lik e
 
--
 
so in order to get to the grocery store Ihadto go througha park.  Pretendall of  youare 
that park. 
 
So
 
I startedwalkin g down the steps into thepark. And the gatekeeper came out 
and he said to m e
 
youcan't walk through the park anym or
e.  And he started
 
calling m e nam es. 
He  s a id
:  D
on't you da
re go through the park anym ore. Soaf ter I got hom e, I toldm y m other.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

Andm y m other said 
don't
 
walk through thepark anym ore.
  
And that was it.  
 
 
So the next tim e she told m e to get a loaf of  bread, and I was very happy.  I get to 
the steps.  I said to m yself
:  O
h, I'm  very tired; I do not want to walk all the way around
; g
o this 
wa y, down this street, up this street, andover there.  So guess whatI did.  I went down the 
steps and walked
 
--
 
tried to walk through the park. 
 
 
So the gatekeeper cam e out.  Andhe started tothrow rocks atm e.  And he started 
t o  c a ll 
m e "
Y
ou dirty Jew"  and all kinds of horrible things. Butthe worst part of it was hehad a 
daughter, and she was notm uch older thanI,and shefollowed whatherf ather was doing.  

Af ter all,he was her role model.  So she didthe sam e thing.  I was terribl y upset. I ran home 
tom y m other and Inever walked through thatpark again.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other hadhad your youngestbrother in 1938, but she really had no 

choice but to have him at home 
as I recall. Tell us a little bitabout that.
 
>> S u s a n
 
W arsinger: Yeah.  I remember thenight shehad the baby because she was not
 
--
 
Jewish people were not allowed to walk
 
--
 
to go tothe hospital
.  S
o she hadthe baby at hom e.  
And I don't think she had evenam idwif e. She had som ebody to help her. So my
 
brother Joe 
andI, we had to sit outside on the steps andwait f or her tohave the baby.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And it was all because she was not allowed to go to a hospital.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, you mentioned earlier that as things got worse with your f ather having 

lost his business, you hadtom ove to different housing each time because you couldn't afford 
where you were.

>> SusanW arsinger: Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about theplace youended up at. 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W elived on 11 [Speaking Germ an]
.  
There was aplace, the Adolph 
Hitler Platz.  It was like a big square. Thehouse was there.  It was a house. W e lived onthe 
f irstf loor. Andthe rabbi of  thetown lived on the secondf loor.  Anon
-
J e wis h  f am ily li ve d  
on  
the thirdf loor.  Andup on top was the attic. W estoredapples andexciting things up in that 

a ttic.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat brings us, then
,  
to that terrible night in November
 
9 through 10, 1938
,  
that we call Kristallnacht or Night of Broken Glass.  Please tell us what you rem em beror know 

about Kristallnacht, that night,for you and your fam ily.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Ok.  My m other and I
 
--
 
m y brother Joe and I
 
--
 
the one that you saw, 
that was in thepicturebef ore, was on the right
-
hand side
; t
he  o l de r  on e
, n
otthe baby, the 
older one.W e shareda room. We were very excited that nightbecause it was going to be our 

m other's birthday.  It was the eve of the 9th of Novem ber.W e had just gone to sleep. Andall 
of  a sudden som ebricks and rocks were being thrown through the window.  My brothe
r i s  
m uch braver than Iam.  I coweredunder m yblanket.  He was brave.  He went to the window 
andpulled him self  up,andhe looked over the window.  He saw that it was our neighbors that 
were throwin g the bricks and rocks through the window.  Andtherewas a civil policem an 
standing at the edge of the crowd, standing like this. He didn'tdoanything to stopthe crowd 
f rom  throwing these bricks and rocks throughthe window.
 
 
So we were really ver y scared. So m y brother and I rushed tom y parents'

bedroom. W hile we were crossing the hall som e people outsidehad uprooted a telephone 
poleandthey smashed down ourf ront door,which was m ade outof beautif ul glass. It was 
blueand green and red.  And the glass wasstrewn all over the hall.  Their objective was to get 
to the rabbi's apartment and to loot
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he was on the secondf loor where you areon thef irst f loor.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.  And they lootedsom e of our things butit wasn't too ser
ious.  Then 
they went up to the rabbi's house. And, of course, they destroyed alot of  valuable things that 

he had in
 
his apartm ent.  So m yf ather said, well, let's go hide up inthe attic until this whole 
thing blows over.  Because it was dangerous.
 
 
W e 
wentup to theattic. There we hadapples storedf rom the winter
 
--
 
f or the 
winter
 
because it was Novem ber and we had just gotten allof  these wonderful apples.  Sothe 
rabbi's children were up there andourf am ily was up there.  But the rabbi wasn't ther
e .  S o  I 
asked, "W here is the rabbi?"   They didn'ttellm e.  And just then there was this little slit in the 

windo w f rom  the attic. I looked outside and there he was on his veranda.  And two SS 
of f i c e r s
 
--
 
how m any of you have been to thepermanent exhibitalready?  And how m any of 
you are going?  Oh, good.  Sothis is what I would likefor you to look for while you're going up 

to the permanent exhibit.  And thoseof  you who have seen it you saw those SS off icers in the 
brown unif orm s with the swastika ontheir arm .
  
The civil policemen
 
--
 
lookf or that when you 
f irst getup to thefourth floor. You see two policem en walking together.  One isa civil 

policeman, a big blue hat and a blue unif orm .  
 
 
T hispolicem an didn't do anything.
  
Anywa y, the rabbi was 
on his veranda and two 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

of  the SS off icers, the m en in thebrown unif orm s, were holding him andanotherone cam e 
along and cut off his beard. And at that tim e, you know, having a beard was prestigious and 
som ething important that a rabbi
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
You saw that.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes, I did
. 
 
I d id . 
 
 
So Ifoundout lateron thatthey didn't only go  to our apartment but they did that to 
ever y Jewish f am ily in our town of Bad Kreuznach.  And then Ifound out that they looted all the 
Jewish stores
 
that were still there.  And then I foundoutthat they tried toburndown our 
synagogue. 
  
And then If ound out later onthat they notonly
 
--
 
they didn'tonly do that in our 
town but they did it in every town in Germ any.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hundreds of synagogues burned.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Right.  Right.  And lotsof  people losttheir homesand lost their 
belongings.  Andm any of the stores hadto close up.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  And on that night
 
thousandsof  Jewish m en were arrestedand taken to a 
concentratio
n cam p. W hat about yourf ather? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: T he rabbi was taken to prison.  Didn't takehim  to a concentration cam p.  

Butm y father, he went for afew hours andthen he cam e back.  I could never figure out why 
m y f ather wasn't sentto prisonor the concentration cam p.
 
 
T he thing is, we f ound out that m yf ather
 
--
 
later on If ound out in life thathe was a 
f riend of the chief  of police in Bad Kreuznach. They usedtoplay chess together.  And If igure, 
well, m aybe that's what saved him .
  
Also, he 
was Polish.  He had been born inPoland. And at 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

thattim e the Nazis had not gone to war with Poland yet
 a
nd maybe because he was a Polish 
citizen.  I don't know.
 
 
I just want to tell the audience.  Youask your grandparents everything that you 
want to f in
d out because af ter a while, you won't know
.  A
nd I'm sosorry that I didn't askm y 
father som any m ore things.  I would understandthings, perhaps, or some of my curiosity 
would not be so greatas it is now. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How long do youthink you stayed in thatattic with this terror really going all 
over
 
--
 
as you said, not only all over
 
your town  butall over Germany?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.  I was a little kid.  I really don't remember.  But I think it was just a 

few days.  Because we didn'thave any
 
place to go tothe bathroom and we didn't have 
anything to eat except those apples. 
 
 
Did I ever tell you the story aboutm yf ather who keptall of his money
 
--
 
m aybe the 
audiencem ight want to know.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ido want you to share thatactually.  I was tryin g to think how I'm  going toask 
you that.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: My f atherhad som emoney saved upf rom , Iguessf rom the store, 

whatever, f rom  sellingthe strawberries. So at that tim e we didn't
 
--
 
Jews didn't keepm oney in 
thebank.  I guess they kept it under their mattress. W hen we were hiding in theattic, m y 

father toldme to put the money inm y underwear.  So I remember Ifelt very im portantbutI 
also had to go to the bathroom a lot so that money got very wet.

>> B ill 
Benson:  But itstayed safe. Thatm ay m atter later. 
 
 
So the events of that night, of Kristallnacht, ofthatnight, that led your parents to 
m ake this very profound decision thatthey want to the get outof  Germ any.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.
 
>> B ill B e n s
on: T ell us what they tried to do and what they were able todo.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.  Bef ore the Night of Broken Glassa lotof  Jewish people that 
were li ving in Germ any, they didn't want to leave.  T hey saw these atrocities that were going 
on against the Jews but they didn't want to leave.  T hey thought, well , maybe things will blow 
over
;  
the Nazis wil l beoutof the governm entandthings will be all right.  But after the Night of  
Broken Glass, every J ew wanted to get out of  Germany.
 
 
W her e we r e  t h
ey going to go? T hen, you know, ever ybody had a quota. T he 
United States hada quota.  My m other wanted to go.  She hadalways wanted to go to the 

United States. She had heard about how wo nderf ulthe United States was.  So we wanted to 
com e, but the UnitedStateshad a quota.  And all the other countries had a quota.
 
 
And when youpeoplego up to the perm anent exhibit, there is an editorial cartoon 
with " T he New York T im es" and ittalks about how thepeople wanted to get out of Germ any 
but there was this
 
Evian Conference andall of the countries wantedto get together to see 
what they coulddo tohelp the Jewish people.  But every country except the Dominican 

Republic said we're not going to raiseour quota. So there isthis editorial,
 
there's no placef
o r 
this non
-A
ryan or 
--
 
the Nazis called them selves Aryans
.  T
here was no placefor us to go.

Anyway.  So m y father had heard of this lady who was sm ugglin g children across 
theborder.  If  you saw in the map,Bad Kreuznach isnot toof arf rom Frankf urt.  I know m ost 
of  
you know where Frankfurt is.  In the car maybe it's two hoursaway
, s
o closer to the French 
border. My f ather had heardof  this lady andshe was going to takechildren across the border 

for afee.  So m yf ather had the money dried up, andm y father gave all of  this money tothis 
lady to get us saf ely across theborder into France.

hadtopretend that I was sleeping because ifI had woken up, he would have spoken in French 
tom e andat that time I didn't know how to speak any French.

>> Bill Benson:  And then,of  course, youhave your youngest brother with you at the tim e. So 
you go to France.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Go to France. W e getto
 
Paris.  And here we are, m y brother and I, we 
found this third cousinwho li ved in Paris inPlace de laVendom e.  He had this very sm all, li ttle

>> SusanW arsinger: And m y brother, I toldyou, you know, he was ver y curious and brave.  
He used to sneak outof that apartm entandgo on the Metro in Paris and go all over the Metro.  
He looked
 
all over Paris.  And then before the cousin came home,he was alwa ys back in tim e. 
 
He was ver y curious.  He's a wonderf ulperson.  He still is.  I love him  very much.
 
 
Anyway, this m an couldn't keepus any longer.  So with the help of either the 
Q
uakers 
o r the  HIA S or th e
 
--
 
these were all organizations that werehelping children tof ind a 
place. All them oney that sometimes we gi ve to organizations, they really do a wonderf ul job 
about helping children.
 
 
Anyway, they helpedm y brotherand me tostay with af am ily in the outskirts, in a 
tiny little vil lage in the outskirts of Paris. Sonow it's 1940. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that.  If I rem ember right, that was nota particularly happy place 

for you.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.  Well, when wewent to this lady

I was just going to skipthat 
part.

keeping children to m akem oney f rom  this 
organization.  She had a daughter. She was ver y good to her daughter, but she wasn't very 

good to us. And we were not allowed to go to the bathroom in thehouse. W ehad to goeat

>> B ill B e n s o n :  O n ly allo
we
d in thehouse tosleep.  That was it.  And you slept on straw.
 
>> Susan W a
rsinger: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Anywa y, well, let's forget about this lady.  Going to go 
to the other children's home. There were two young girls.  T hey didthe same thing.  And they 
were very good tous. 
  
AndI went to public school. I learned how to speak
 
French.  You 
know, kids are wonderful.  T hey learn
 
--
 
if  youcan't speakthe language, and you can't do 
anything else, you have to learn it.  So by that tim e I could speak Frenchpretty well.
  
 
 
But thebad part happened in 1940 when theNazis, you know, they f irst went into 
Austria andthen Czechoslovakia and Poland.  And it was time to conquer Francebecause this 
was Hitler's objective to conquerall of Europe.
 
>> Bill Benson:  May
 
1940.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes, May
 
1940.W e were sleeping in ourbedroom s. W e see the 
bombsfalling near us.  It looked like the 
Fourth
 
of  July.  So anyway, this was right near Paris.
 
 
Finally in June of 1940, the Nazis cam emarching with their arm ies into France. 
Ever ybody was really frightened. So peoplewanted to leave.
  
It wasn't only the Jewish people 
that weref rightened. People wanted to get out. So they either went south to Vichy or some of  
them  went west and som eof them  went to Versailles.
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasa mass exodus out ofParis, tens of thousands of  
people f leeing 

including you and your brother.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Right.  So Idon't know who tookus.  I think itwas some nuns who took 

us.  Idon't rem em ber.  People weref leeing in cars and bicycles andwalking.  It was just this

people just going
; j
ustgoing and running away.
 
 
So where were they going to go? T hey went to
 
Versailles.T hey thought it would 
be safe there.  So we were there.  So whenwe got to Versailles, there was a palace. And in 
thatpalace, like you were telling the audience before,the chief off icial of the town said,"
W
hat 
am I going to do with all of thesepeople thatare com ing toVersailles?"  Sohe says, well, we 

have toputthem up som eplace. So guess where they putus up. In thepalace inthe Hall of  
Mi rro rs .
 
 
Anybody 
been in thatHall of  Mirrors?  Yeah?  Anywa y, f or those ofyou who haven't 
seen it, it's this long room. T here arem irrorsall over, crystal chandeliers all over the place. 
So what they did is they gave us these burlap bags. T hey had this pile of  h
a
y o u
t s i d e.   W e 
f illed the burlap bags and we tiedthem up tightly.  T hen we laidall of ourm attressesagainst 

theedges of the Hall of  Mirrors.  So there were all of thesepeople, one after theother, in the 
Hall of  Mirrors. So we stayed there.  I don't rem ember who gave us food, but I rem em ber 
sleeping on thosem attresses.  I tell you, the straw was itching m y back. 
 
 
But then the Nazis didn't stay in Paris.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they com e to Versailles.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.  They had com e to Versailles. W e heard them  with their boots.  
You know, those boots they have up to here. W eheard them marching. W eheard the tanks.  
W eheard the comm otion. And they stopped inf ront of the palace.T here was this head guy.  I 
don't know, maybe hewas a colonelor
 
am ajor or som ething.  He wanted to talkto thehighest 
off icial in Versailles.  So they got the two of them together.

>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.  Som e kind of com mander.  I don't know what he was.  
 
 
Anyway, the German comm anderdid not know how to speak any Fr ench.  And the 
French official didn't know how to speakany Germ an. So they wanted to talk toeach other, so 

they needed an interpreter. They didn'thave
 
one.
  
Somebody in the crowd yelled:W
ell,  we  
know this little girl who lives in the palace, who's living in the palace, and she knows how to 

speak German.
 
So guess who they got. 
 
 
So Itell you, I was scared.  I really was scared. T he Nazi off icer was ta
ll,  lik e  th e  
ceiling.  AndI could just seeto thetop of his boots. So they said som ething toeach other. I 
really don't know what it was they said, but they seem ed to be satisf ied.  I had translatedeach 
person.  So they seemed to be satisf ied.
 
 
And at
 
theend of the conversation the Nazi off icer turns tom eand he says, 
ﬁL
it t le  
girl, how com e you know how to speak Germ an so well?  So I said to him , 
ﬁO
h, the French 
schools are very good and I learn

it in the French schools.
ﬂ
  
And then he clickedhis h

like that.  And thenoise, the noise that it made.  I
 
still rem em ber.  And he bowed t

said thank you very m uch andhe left.

>> Bill Benson:  So you can't stay in Versailles.  So now you m ove on.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.  We can't stay. So at that tim ethe Nazis were invading all of  
these countries. So what they said in
 
France 
that the northern part of  the France was going to 
be theoccupied area ofthe Germ ans.  And then Idon't know if  you noticed on the mapbut 

there was this white line.  It was m ostly the southern part of  France. Not the part that was near 
the ocean
 
but because the Nazis wanted thatfor them selves.
  
So there was one area inthe 
southern part, in the m iddle. Vichy was in there.  And they said to the French peoplethat this 

was going to be their part of the country.  Butthe leaderof  the
 
--
 
>> B ill B

>> SusanW arsinger: He was in cahoots with the Nazis, too.
 
 
So we wanted to get to safety.  So we went to Vichy.  And near Vichy is a little town 
called Brout
-
Vernet. And there they have
 
--
 
they hada chateau,a castle, which was really 
dilapidated.  And there Jewish children thistim ef rom
 
all over France that had come that were 
refugeesf rom  Germany and Polandand Belgium  andall the other countries
.  T
hey ended up 
in that particular chateau. It was a children'shome. It was runby the O

care of  us.

>> SusanW arsinger: Right.  Right.

I know this was Vichy, France. There was so 
m uch collaboration with the Nazis.  Here's aplacef illed with Jewish children. Did the 
townspeople know you were there?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.  The townspeople knew we were there. T hey hada public school, 

andhereall of these kids have to go to school.  But the townspeople, they didnot want us to 
go to their school because they did not want these childrento rub elbows with their children.  
T hese were allf arm ers. T hey would have learned so muchf rom the childrenbecause we 
were cosm opolitanand we went f rom all of  thesediff erent countries and we would have

W hat happened was there really wasn't m uchwe could dofor eachother's birthday.  
So when we knew it was som ebody's birthday, like two or three weeks aheadof  tim e, we used 

to get a little bit of dessert som etim es. So we usedtonoteat it.  Every one of  us had a locker 
in the attic.  And so we pickedone of our lockers and we putall thedesserts that all the kids 
had saved. 
 
It wasn't very m uch. All the dessert that kidshad saved.  And we put it in that 
locker.  And then when it was tim efor the person's birthday, we wen t down tothe ca

got this brown tray and then we putdoilies onit
 
and then we put all of our loot that we had

put thef lowers in.  And then we putthe tray on the person's bed sobef ore they woke up. And 
then we all the waited for that person to wakeup; then we sang " Happy Birthday."   It was

and I'm not making this up. T his really happened.  At exactly 6:00, 
thefog just lif ted like acurtain inthe theater. You know, like in an opera house or at amusical.  
It lifted up, and there was the Statue of Liberty ri ght in f rontof us.

ou've experienced Americanf ood. But now you're experiencing Am erican culture, reuniting 
with your parents thatyou have not seenf orseveral years. W hat was that likefor you? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: W ell, it was wonderf ul to be
 
with our parents
, b
ut we didhave to get 
adjusted to the culture in the United States. W ehad to goto school. W e didn't know how to 

speak any English.  It was ver y diff icult f or me.
  
In that tim e they didn't have any ESL teachers.  
Now kids get special
 
help in the schools. There was nobody thereto help kids with problem s.
 
Andalso at that tim e they had homogeneousgrouping
, w
hich m eans that all of the smart kids 
were in one class and the dumb kids were inanother class, the inbetween kids were in 

d if
ferent classes.  So 7B1 is where all the dum b kids were
, 
so they putm e in 7B1because I 
didn't know how to speak any English.  Andthe kids
 
--
 
I 
was really surprised because in

>> S u s a
nW arsinger: Yes.  Exactly.  Here these kidsthat were in that class,they didn't do 
their homework
 
an
d acouple of people fell asleep in class. And I could not believe sucha 
thing.  So I was really upset.  But then Ifound out thatall of  theproblem  kids were in that 
cla ss.  
 
Of course, we don't do that in thepublic school system  anym ore. But anyway, I 
f ina lly
 
--
 
when I learned how to speak English a little bit,I got outof 7B1and got to 7B2. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And worked your way up f rom  there. Ab
solutely. 
 
 
I want toask you justa couple of questions, Susan
, 
before we m ight have tim e f or a 
couple of  questionsf rom  the audience.
 
 
W hat happened, to your knowledge
,  
tootherkids that were at theorphanage? 
 
>> SusanW arsinger: T hat's thebad part. 
 
Ifyou go through the Museum, you will learn
 
--
 
especially theone exhibit, "Som eW ere Neighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the 

Holocaust."  They took thousands of Jewish people and they put them
 
--
 
this was near Paris.  
T hey put them  into this big arena.  And allof  the French policemen just helped.  And whilethey 

were there, they putthem  on thetrains and sent them  to the concentration camps. 
 
 
T hey did the sam ething in thepart inthe unoccupied zone. Eventually all of  those 
people were collaborators and said
:  H
ere,here are the 
J e ws ;
 
take them.  Som osteveryb ody 
was killed.  I don't know of many peoplethatsurvi ved.
 
 
All of m y relatives, the onesthat were onm y father's side, they were born in

Poland. Soall of  them lived in Poland
, 
wh i c h
 
is now the Ukraine.  And if  you go to theexhibit 
thatI was just telling you about
 
--
 
af ter you see thepermanent exhibit, go see the otherone.  
T he Nazis didn'tevenput them  inthe concentration camps. W hat they did with thepeople
 
in  
the Ukraine they just gathered them  up and shot them  andput them in graves and buried them 
in the graves.  So that's what happenedtoall of  the relatives onm y father's side.
 
 
My m other had some relatives in Germany.  Ifound thatthey were in the 
concentration cam ps a
nd they died in the concentration cam ps.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you lost m ost of  yourfamily.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One other question I wanttoask you.  Just today, just anhour ago bef orethis 

program  began, you were able to lookatandtouch documentsf or the f irst time in your lif e.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Very profound. Tell us aboutthose.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.  I got thise
-
m ailf rom a guy called Ron Colem an. I think he'sover

>> B ill B e n s o n :  Ra

>> SusanW arsinger: He calledm e up

ma il.   He  
said:  If ound som epapers that youm ight beinterested inand that youm ight

that you 
probably didn't know that they existed.
  
So I im mediatel

he said
,  ﬁD

-
m a il 
t h em  t o 
you? And I said, 
ﬁM

ﬂ
  
So he e

HIAS. W hat were theother ones? 
 
>> [ I

>> SusanW arsinger: Yes.  Several other organizations thatm y father got in touch
 
with  to try 
tof ind us in France.  So eventually they f ound us. And eventually all of theseorganizations 
helpedm y brotherand m e to come over.
 
 
T oday hem ade copies of  it so that if I get it lost online, Ihave som ecopiesof  them .  
T hey are like 100 pages of correspondence.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You held f or thef irst time ever. W hat was that liketo read those words?
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  It was ver y e xciting becauseI saw m y father's
 
hand
writ in g.   T h e  En glis h

he wasn't speaking English too well.  Somebody else must have written itf or him
a
nd then 
he signedhis name on the bottom . Butthe language is his
 a
nd thesignature is his. And I 
touched it.  It was ver y
 
m oving.  Yeah. 
 
 
T hank you.  T hank you. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have tim ef ora coupleof questionsf rom theaudience. I want to rem ind

M

SusanW arsinger: T hat's a very good question.  You want to

>> Bill Benson:  No,no.  I think you're going to answer that.  Right?
 
>> SusanW arsinger: Yeah.  He's going to ask m eattheendm y last

what is it you say?
 
>> Bill Benson: T he last word.
 
>> SusanW arsinger: And I'm going to tell it to you right then.

[Laughter]
 
 
And we have one righthere.  Let me get them ic to you
 
if you don'tm ind. 
 
>> T hank you,f irst of all, for being here and sharing all of  this with all of  us.  I wondered if  you 
ever had a chanceto go back and what that was like.
 
>
> Bill Benson: T he question is
 
didSusan go back and what was that likefor her. T hankyou.  
I would liked to have asked thatm yself.
 
>> Susan W arsinge
r: T hat's a very good question andI'm  glad youasked it.  Whenm y kids 

were, like, 16 and when they were teenagers
 
--
 
I think it was in 1973, something like that.  I 
told them  that I would like to show them m y town of  BadKreuznachwhere I was born.  So 
we  
packed and we got toBad Kreuznach.  I was really very e xcited to show them
, b
ut the 
people
 
--
 
[No audio]
 
--
 t
here were lace curtains, looking. W hen they saw m e looking, they 
im mediately closed the curtain.
 
 
You know, in 1973, in the 70,nobody wanted 
to talk about what happened.  The 
Jews and the survivors didn't wantto talk about what happened. They all wanted toforget.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

T hey wanted tobeAmericans. They wantedto be
 
--
 
not rememberany of  their experiences.
 
W e were going to stay therefor a week.
  
W estayed two days and left because it was 
uncomf ortable.
 
 
But then maybef ive years ago m y other brother, the baby brother
 
--
 
he is a big 
scie n t ist .   He 's a
 
--
 
he's intophysics.  He does a lotof  work with theozone in theair.  He goes 
all over the country.  He meets with scientists.  So afew years ago he had to go to Germ any to 
a town not toofarf rom BadKreuznach tom eet with the scientists. So I said to him , 
ﬁC
a n I go  
with you?
ﬂ
  
And he said sure. 
 
 
T his was in the late90s, or maybe it was in 2000.  Something like that. So we went 
and I said to him , 
w
ell, af ter youf inish your meeting let's go to BadKreuznach. Inthe 
m eantim e,I had written to the mayor andI had written todiff erentpeople and they said, oh, 
com e, and we will pay for your room in the hotel.  It was in thef ancy hotel.  So we got there 
andthe reporters came. T hem ayor tookme outto tea.  Another lady took me all over Bad 
Kreuznach and showed me what the town did now to rem em ber what hadhappenedduring 
the Holocaust.
 
 
S o  it  
was anentirely different experience.  And the sam ething thathappened in the 
United States.  Nobody wanted to talkaboutthe Holocaust.  It wasn't until 1993 when this 
building opened up and everybody cam e outof  the closet. Germans came out of the clos
e t.  
And the survi vors came out of the closet.  And the whole world
 
--
 
it's  im portantf or us to know 
t h is
 
--
 
getting back to your question, it's im portantfor us to know this because when we see 
injustice happening
 
we have todo something about it. But I'll talkabout that.

>> Bill Benson:  In justa moment. W e're going to closeour program in amoment. I will turn 
back to Susanbecause we believe our
 
F i rs t  Pers o n
 
hastohave the last word.  So that'swhat 
we'll do. 
 

 
I want to rem ind you that we have th
e se  
program severyW ednesday and Thursday 
until them iddle of August.  Hopethat you can com ebackeither this year at another timeor in 

future years. And our website includes inf orm ation about theprogram .
 
 
I want toalso rem ind you that when Susanf inishes, one, she's going to leave the 
stage when she's completely done and go
 
up so she can sign copies of " E
c ho e s  of  
M
em ories."   
If you would like totalk to her or purchase a copy that wouldbe great, or say hi.
  
The other 
thing, when Susanf inishes I'm  going toask you all to stand.  And the reasonfor that is our 
photographer, Joel, will takea picture of Susan with her back to you but you're thebackdrop.  
It has justa wonderfuleff ect.  So we're going to do that, if you don'tmind.
 
 
W ith  th a t I will  tu
rn to Susanto close our program .
 
>> SusanW arsinger:  I want my children,m y grandchildren,m y brothers and theirf am ilies, m y 
f riends andthe visitors  here in the audience to rejoice in thef act that we are living in a 
democratic society and that all of us should make sure that no dictatorship would ever usurp 
our liberties.W e need to rem em ber the atrocity that happened tof am ilies during the 
Holocaust and pass this inf ormation on toour 
progeny
. W eneed to learnf rom  this horror and 
history. W e cannotundo theatrocitiesof  thepast,but besides rem em bering we have totake 

actionto conf ront hate.  W hen we see injustice taking place, we have to do something about it.  
W ecannotbeonlookers.  W ehave to be sensitive to each other and we have to take c
a r e of  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

each other.
 
 
W hydo I volunteer in this m useum ? Peopleask me how can 
you 
do thisover and 
over
.
  
How can I not? Giving tours to our visitors throughour permanent exhibit hopefully 
teaches them  what hatred and prejudice cando to people. W hen touring law enf orcem ent 
off icers andfuture FBI agents, I hopethat they understand their rolewhen encountering 
atrocities. W ecannot be bystanders anddef initely not be collaborators. 
 
 
T here are threats of genocide inm any partsof the world at the prese
n t time .  W e 
cannot be indifferent to emerging threats of genocide andm ass atrocities.  All of usneed to be 
aware about what is happening.  And we need to work together andtake the necessary 
actionstoprevent people f rom  being murderedfor the simple reason that they are different. 
 
Never again do we wa nt to standby anddo nothing. 
 
 
I want to thank you, Bill Benson,for helping me tellm y story.  And Iwant to thank 
you, theaudience,f orcoming to ourm useum and being witnesses to the story of  the 

Ho
locaust andf or listening tom y story. 
 
 
Now, those of you who are going to goup to the permanent exhibit,I would just like 
you m ake surethat you lookat certain things that areup there.  You m ight want to look
 
--
 
there'sone that has todo with boycotting. T here's the SS man standing inf ront of the store.  

And then there are the two policem en walking together with theferocious dog.  Make sure you 
look at that exhibit. And thenm ake surethatyou look at the Jewish responses and see what 
the Jews did af ter theNazis ver y slo wly started their discrim inationagainst the Jews.  And then 
take a look at that 
Evian Conference, editorial cartoon. And thenalso take a look
 
--
 
we have a

I hope that you have awonderful learning experience.
