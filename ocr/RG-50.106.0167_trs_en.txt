When I used to take the meal
 they gave me a -- more, a li
ttle bit more to eat. I u sed

 diarrhea, o-oh, the diarrh ea was undescribable what it was. 
You know, with this kind of 
food what you eat. They used

already. Bread only, 70 grams of bread

Q: A tent? A tent? 
A: A tent. In a tent, and we used to make th

 pick up the food in  
the forest. And when th

 we didn™t wait til the next 
day. Was not an easy life. 

Q: How was your health? Were you as strong? Did you have a strong body?

42
A: I™m very much Jewish minded. I will 
not lie to you, I™m very much Jewish 
minded. I -- nobody could take me away
 from my Jew -- become high holidays I 
go, but not because I believe
. I remember I -- one time 
when I was home even, I say 
to  my  mo ther 
[speaks foreign language here].
 I felt so guilty a
ll my life what I say 
to my mother. I already th
en not believe, and I was 15 - 14 -15. And you know, I 
grew up in a Jewish organization, they 
did not believe too mu ch, they  influenced 
me. 
Q: What -- what Jewish organization was that? 
A: What? 

Q: What Jewish organization was that? 
A: I used to belong to 
Hashomer Hatzair
. But they were leftists, n o t too 
[indecipherable]
 about it. They were leftists. No
t because I hated Jewish things, I 
loved what -- mine Jew ish tradition until th
is day, no less when I was born in my 
home. But as far as Jewish tradition,
 I would never give it up, never. 
Q: Are there any songs that you rememb er singing -- 
A: Songs? 

Q: -- singing from 
Hash omer Hatzair
? Any songs? 
A: I-I don™t have any more a good voice,
 so I don™t want to show you what 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Why don™t you sing just a little bit? 

 
Interview with Eli Dortort 
 
 
August 3, 2005 
 

 
 
43
A: What? 
Q: Why don™t you sing 
just a little bit then? 

A: 
[speaks foreign lang uage]
. All my  life I love you. Oh my  daughter, oh my  
daughter, I love her so much
. She™s the only one what I have left. I cou -- I -- I 
know I don™t have a -- right now a good voice. 

Q: Mm-hm, okay. 

A: I used to have a better voice, but not like my  father used to have a voice 
unbelievable. They killed him oh -- for no 
reason at all. Only reason because they 
were Jews. No reason at all. And among th
e goyim even today wh en I hear, wh ere I 
am right now, they hate us all, ev
en today. Even today they hate us. 
Q: How do you know th at? 
A: What? 

Q: How do you know th at? How do you 
know that? How do y
ou know that they 
hate the Jews to -- 
A: How I know? I could see it every day.
 If I will tell you -- I live right now where 
-- in a place which is mostly they™re not Je
wish people, mostly. 
Hardly any of them 
-- if you would see how they hate
, you wouldn™t believe it in the 
United States
 
of
 
America. 
I tried to figure them out a little bit. It™s unbelievable 
[indecipherable]
 
they hate, no reason at all. To hate Jews
 you don™t need a reas
on. They were Jews, 

 
Interview with Eli Dortort

that™s all w e -- Jews h ave money, Jews ha
ve good business, Jews have this, Je ws 
have this. Like they 
don™t have anything.  
Q: Well, is there anything el
se you wanted to talk about on the t -- on the tape that 
you haven™t -- 

A: If I rememb er, I don™t rememb er too well. I told you right away  I don™t 

remember too much . I could re -- tell you 
a whole book. Oh, I™m sorry. I could tell 
you a whole book, but
 I don™t remember.

 gone? When did your wife pass away? 
A: My va -- wi -- my first wife? 

Q: Yes. 

A: My first wife. I would

A: 
Ruth . 
Q: And tell me more about 
why you ch anged your name. 
A: What? 

Q: Tell me why -- again, why 
you changed your name to 
Dortort
. 

 
Interview with Eli Dortort 
 
 
August 3, 2005 
 

 
 
45
A: Because I deserted the Polish army, a
nd I didn™t want them they find me, and 
then they still have the Eng
lish army, so I didn™t want to
 have this name, because I 
was a deserter at this time. Not only me, 
the greatest part of the Jews, see, people 
who were in the Polish army, they de
served it, too. I™m positive you know 
something about it. A bunch of haters. C
ould you imagine I was sleeping with th em 
in one -- in one t -- tent, and all the time 
they were reading how many Jews they 
killed. Is this a civilized ki -- people? 
Even today they tell you about hating Jews, 
and they™re not afraid. In this 
United States
 I have the last couple of weeks such 
experience with American about hating. Hatin
g open, open, not hi -- hi -- they don™t 

hide it.  
Q: Wha-What was that experience? 
A: What is the exper -- this is the e
xperience. They  hate you. They  hate you 
because Jews. They don™t do it for any othe
r -- do you know, one guy, he came over 
to me, and he said -- one guy to  me he ca
me over and he said, tha-that I -- I could 
not remember everything, that is my  pr
oblem right now. If my  problem wo uld be 

what I could remember a little bit more, 
I could tell you a book.
 Because I was one 
time telling this story, and he said, you kno
w, with your vocabulary and your wh at -
- with your stories, you should
 write a book. I loved it all. 
Q: Oh.

I told her many stories at th

 to tell them the stories. So that they 
used to wait for me to come and -- all 
the time for dinner, and I would tell them 

again the stories, but it™s all gone with the wind. 

Q: Well, your daughter knows it, so it™s not gone. 
A: What? 
Q: Your daughter knows your
 stories, so it™ s not gone. 
A: I told her a lot of storie
