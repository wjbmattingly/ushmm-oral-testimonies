Anita Sockol 
 August 13, 1999 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with Anita Sockol, 
conducted by Amy Reuben, on August 13, 1999, in Wa
shington, D.C.. This is tape number one, 
side A. Would you begin by telling me your name , 
now and at birth, as well as where you were 
born, and when you were born? 
Answer: My name  now is Anita Sockol, and I was born in Berlin, September 17
th
, 1927. My 
name  at birth, is that what you asked -- was Plachte, P-l-a-c-h-t-
e, Anita Plachte.  
Q: Can you tell me  some thing about your fa mily?  
Did you have any siblings, and can you tell me  

about your parents? 

A: My parents -- no, I didn™t have 
any siblings. My parents were 
Margaret and Ludwig Plachte. 
My mother™s ma iden name  is Schindler. And is 
-- they were both born in Berlin, which I think 
they were quite proud of, which tells you some t hing. And -- 

Q: What about their personalitie
s can you -- can you tell me ?   
A: My father was sort of a -- a bachelor when
 he got ma rried. He was a -- I don™t -- He was a 
good ma n, a decent ma n, but not full of humor. And 
bu -- quite set in his ways. He got ma rried 
when he was 40, and he was 42 when they ha
d me . And my  mother was 27 when she got 
ma rried, and was anxious to get out of Ke mnets.
 She told me many, many times, that she got 
ma rried to him very quickly, you know, he asked he
r to ma rry him, and she wanted to ma rry to 
get to Berlin, that™s what she wanted. So, but 
she was fun loving. She had a sense of humor, and 
I think my father sort of kept 
her down, or at least it wa -- it -- 
that™s how it seemed to me . He 
was a, as we say today, a ca -- mut -- a bit of 
a control freak. Or ma ybe more than a bit.

Q: Can you tell me  some thing about the ne
ighborhood where you were growing up in Berlin? 
A: I can see the house in my mi nd™s eye. It 
was, you know, I -- I w
ould say like upper mi ddle 
class, and it had a -- there was a 
park nearby, by Rushaplatz, or wa
s it just a real -- a playground 
with a par -- I™m not quite sure. Not a big park, be
cause Berlin has very big parks, that™s not one 
-- one of them. But it was like a comfortable ne
ighborhood, and I know that Albert Einstein lived 
nearby some where. My mother used to tell me  that
, not that I knew who he 
was at the time, but I 
knew he was some body important. And I guess that
 was a different nei
ghborhood, but where my 
-- when my parents got married, not that same bu
ilding that -- that I grew up in, when they got 
ma rried, before they had me , they lived in a noyb
ow, as they called it, you know, a new building, 
and Marlena Dietrich lived in that building. Thes
e are things that were told to me , yeah.  
Q: Can you describe the -- the home wher
e you were growing up, in mor e  detail? 
A: Yes, it™s -- i-it was a very
 nice, spacious apartment, with
 long hallways, you know, and i-it 
seemed to me like it was quite large, and I know
 there were -- there wa
s a -- what do you call 
that?  Li ke bells that you could ring, you know, and 
it would ring in the bac
k, in the -- near the 
kitchen, like which room the ma id was supposed to 
come  and s -- I was very impressed with this, 
I think, cause I still remember it. But it was, 
you know, mi ddle class, no
thing ultra fancy. I don™t 
even reme mber -- I guess it did have an elevat
or, the building. Yeah, 
it mu st have. I can see 
myself walking into the buildi
ng, and yet it -- it™s murky. 
Q: Are there any sounds, or any smells that remi
nd you of that home  after-- after leaving there? 
Anything that™s come  up 
in the years after? 
A: I don™t know. I -- Sounds perhaps,
 but I -- I don™t -- I don™t know
. I -- I reme mber feeling fear 
when they™d leave me  alone at 
night, that I reme mber. Too early
 for a young child, at least for 
me it was. But I don™t -- because you said sounds, th
at™s what ma de me  think of it, because I™d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
3 
 
 
hear things that probably weren™
t even happening, but in my mind they were. Creaking sounds or 
some thing, and I was frightened to be
 alone, five or 
six, or some thing. 
Q: Had your parents gone out for the evening, 
and left you with a guardian of some  sort? 
A: No, I -- I think I was alone, at least that™s wh
at I reme mbe r . It must have been later on, when 
you couldn™t -- you know, weren™t allo
wed to have a ma id any more. 
Q: And wha t  do you know about the neighborhood?  
Who else lived in th
e immediate area?  Was 
this a Jewish area of Berlin? 
A Jewish quarter of sorts? 
A: I don™t reme mber, but some how I don™t think 
so. I don™t think it was -- no, they were well 
integr ated. I™m sure there were 
Jews living around, but it was -- a-
as far as I ca -- I reme mber, 
when I™d visit a friend, it was pretty fa r away, it
 was -- because this -- the school that I went to 
was a Jewish school. But, I don™t think so, it™s 
-- it™s like saying, you know, 
where I live now in 
Manhattan, do I live in a Jewish 
neighborhood?  No, I don™t. 
A lot of Jews live there, but it™s not 
a Jewish neighborhood. I think that™s how it was in 
Berlin, because I didn™t
 really think that 
anything was going to happen. Thank you very much. 
Q: Can you tell me  wher e your school was loca
ted, and also in relation to where you were, 
growing up? 

A: No, I -- I can™t tell you. I-I
t was called -- I -- I can tell you 
what it was called, Prinsa getten 
Temple, whi c h was a synagogue, and they had a 
school. But where it was in relation to my 
house, I can™t reme mber . How did I get there ev
ery day?  I can™t reme mbe r . I -- Doesn™t -- 
nothing come s to mi nd.  

Q: Do you have ma ny memories of being in your 
home ?  Being with your pa
rents, eating meals, 
observing any holidays? I realize that you we
re young, at the time, but do you have any 
me mories like that?

A: I reme mb er -- I remember meals in our dini ng 
room, I can see the dining room in my -- in my 
mi nd, but holidays, I think we were -- we were 
not very religious. My mot her was, she always 
went to -- always went to synagogue on the 
high holidays, and she always fasted on Yom 
Kippur, that was very important to her, and 
she -- some how she carri
ed that through to, you 
know, very late in life, in New York. And I don™
t reme mber her making holiday meals. We must 
have been invited, or some thing. I know we were
 invited here. It wasn™t like, you know, she 
invited people over. She was not
 that much of a housewife, 
or cook, you know, to -- to cook for 
ma ny peopl e was not her thing. And my father di
dn™t care, you know, as far as holidays were 
concerned.  
Q: Did the three of you go to
 synagogue as a family?   
A: Someti -- I reme mber them being there, being 
at that synagogue, for -- but it must have been 
for me , cause it was Purim or some thing, and prob
ably some thing that parents should attend, so 
it was more for parents attending than for the hol
idays, and yet that  isn™ t quite true. She had a 
Bible, and sh -- I think I have it at ho me stil
l -- that she used, but I™m -- I™ m a little confused 
whether that was in the United States, or there. 

Q: Did you have other relatives in Be
rlin, and were they
 living close by? 
A: I had my father™s brother, and his wife. 
That™s my Uncle Martin and Tanta Trudy. I never 
called her aunt, cause I never saw her again, Ta
nta Trude, and my cousin, Ilsa. They had one 
daughter, and I was very fond of her, very close to
 her, or wanted to be, because I was an only 
child, and I was not very happy about that, so I 
wa nted to think of her as a sister, was happy 
when once in awhile we™d get some  dresses th
at were the same  dress, you know, in -- in our 
respective sizes. But they lived -- 
I know they lived a subway ri
de away, and I -- I think I once 
went there. It was sort of as if we lived in 
Manhattan, and they lived 
in Brooklyn kind of thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

That™s what I s -- reme mber, and they were mo
re modest -- had a more modest income, and I 
don™t know what he did for a living, but -- but we di
dn™t -- I -- I didn™t see he
r as often as I would 
have liked. She went to a different
 school, and she was a little older 
than I was, and -- but I -- I 
wanted to se -- to -- to -- want
ed mor e  of a connection. Why we didn™t, I -- I™m not quite sure. I 
was really a lonely child.  
Q: What other friendships 
do you reme mber from Berlin? 
A: I reme mb er Hi-Hilda Lerbenthal, Lowenthal. 
She was at one -- some body in my class, who I 
was good friends with, and she had a large family, so
 that must have been fairly -- she had a 

younger brother and two older brothers, and it 
was like a happy household, and I loved going 
there, because it was a lot going on, and you know, pl
ayed with her brothe rs, and attention was 
paid, and meals of mi - milk and cookies, or 
whatever. And then I had a friend name d Levia 
Aronfeld, who I™ve seen in New York, I™ve run into
 her, and she had -- I -- I recognized her, 
which was really quite some thing. And another 
person, Marion Faulk. There were quite a few. 
Eva Simon. I re -- just reme mber these name s, 
and I did have birthday parties, yes, that I 
reme mber, had birthday parties, my mother made 
me  birthday parties, and she had these lovely 
little cups and saucers, each one 
was different from another. I have
 just a couple of them left, I 
have them in my den, cause they -- eventually th
ey chipped and broke, and 
this and that, but I li -
- I loved them, and it™s serving -- served us co
coa in those cups, you know, each one, they were 
very pretty, china, you know, each one was totall
y different from the other. We called them 
Zameltussen. And maybe something will come to
 mi nd about holidays, but -- I reme mber a 

Christma s tree that she sa -- bre -- she got for 
when we had a ma id, because she wanted it, you 
know, and she did it for her, we had a Christma s 
tree. Of course, no Christ-like orname nts on it, 
but it had some thing on it, jelly rings, or some thing, I don™t know.

Q: Was the maid living with you full time at your home?  
A: Yes, yes, she was, because there was a room off the kitchen, a small room, and that was 

Emma ™s room, that was the fi
rst one that I reme mber.  
Q: While you were living in Berli
n, were there more than -- was there more than one ma id that 
you recall? 

A: Yes, there was another one after that, name
d Lotte, and she was also there for quite a few 
years. I think she was there until it was prohibited to
 have maids. Then they said they could have 
Jewish ma ids, but I think that never came  off, that I can reme mber. 

Q: And wha t  do you reme mber about your interac
tion with the ma ids that you knew in Berlin? 
A: They were my friends, I mean I -- I sa -- I use the word ma i ds, you know, I -- I shouldn™t 

really, it™s -- they were like 
my -- what™s the word -- like my companions, not really a -- they 
were like my babysitters, you know, my nursema idsis a better -- even though they did do the 

cleaning, I think, dishes, I don™t remember having 
any other -- anyone else in help. But my 
mother was very nervous when I was born, I knowthat, she™s told me  that, and she gave me  
away, sh -- and I always thought, f-for years, un
til I -- til my late years, you know, that my 
friends who are psycho -- psychol
ogists and -- and social workers said, ﬁYou know, that wasn™t 
really such a terrific thing.ﬂ 
She thought she did a wonderful 
thing, she didn™t have enough milk, 

and she gave me  away t o a clinic. Clinic is not what
 a clinic is here. Clinic is like a private thing 

where they -- Dr. Lungstein, she 
told me , out in -- it was a good di
stance, and she said she went 
there several times a week to see me , and they had a -- what do you call them, wet -- wet nurses, 

because she thought that I wasn™t going to -- goin
g to ma ke it, or some thing. I -- I don™t know if 
any of this really was necessary or true, but that
™s what she did, and that™s what she told me . But 
it™s sort of interesting, you know
, as a mother and grandmother when I look back on this, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
7 
 
 
what did that really mean, to give away a ne
wborn, and I said, ﬁHow l
ong was that?ﬂ And she -- 
It was like a half a year, wh
ich is sort of mi nd-boggling. 
Q: Do you reme mber as a child being close to bo
th your mother and father, or more so to one? 
A: I reme mb er being closer to my mother, yes, defi nitely to my mother. 
Q: What kind of work did your father do? 

A: He was a ma nufacturer of dr
esses and blouses, that was a --
 I guess a common combination in 
-- in the garment area, in Berlin in 
those days, dresses and blouses, yes. 
Q: And did your mo m stay at home with you? 

A: Yes, she stayed at home . She -- She didn™t work, no.  

Q: And, do you have any specific me mories of -- of
 any -- any interactions
 with the maids that 
you knew well during those times, or
 -- I know that you seem to have fond me mories of them, 
but anything in -- speci
fic that you recall?  
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: Can you actually tell me  what you reme mber, 
as far as the layout of your home, when you 
entered?  I think you were me ntioning this. 
A: Yeah. Well, i-it --  it --  it -- 
to m -- to me, it seemed as if -- to me it seems now, like it was 
quite a large apartment. When you came in t -- i-it 
was a long -- there was a 
corridor to the first 
room, was my room, which was a -- as you -- as you came into the apartment, and then there was 

a living room, and a hamsi mmer, as my mother 
called it, with a schockladenshun, which she had 
a key to, it means it was -- that™s where she kept  
the chocolates, and they were like a treat when 
you got some. And then the dining room, and then 
a long hallway, which led to the room that the 
housekeeper had, and then the kitchen. And I think 
that was it, but it seem
ed very large. Maybe 
they were very spacious rooms. It was sort of an elegant apartment, the way I reme mb er it.

Q: Did you have friends in the neighborhood?  It 
sounds like you mostly have friends at school. 
Any friends in the neig
hborhood that you recall? 
A: Not that I recall -- I don™t 
recall going, you know, upstairs or dow
nstairs, or next building or 
some thing, to play with anyone. I™m sure I must ha
ve, I -- I don™t know, I mu
st have blocked it or 
some thing, but I don™t reme mber doing it. 
Q: Do you reme mber having non-Jewish friends inBerlin, or even knowing if a friend is not 

Jewish at the time? 

A: Hm, it™s a good question. I don™t -- I don™t real
ly know the answer. I guess ma ybe I was -- 
ma ybe I was  subliminally aware of it, or even if
 you didn™t speak about it, because right from the 
beginning, I went to a -- 
I was sent to a Jewish school, and I knew why. 
Q: You were told why you were being sent there? 

A: Yeah, yeah, yes. 

Q: What did your -- Wh at 
did your parents tell you? 
A: They wanted me to escape the anti-Semitism. They were afraid for the an-anti-Semitism, so 

that was -- I™m trying to th
ink, 1933 or some thing, six years 
old. I don™t know when you begin 
school, yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber already having an awareness 
of anti-Semitism, besides what your parent s 
were telling you about sendi
ng you to this school? 

A: I was aware of it. Now, I 
don™t know if it was before, or 
after entering school, or it was 
simultaneous, but I do reme mber, I reme mber para
des, and ma rches, and -- and you know, those 
banners, and fl ags, and -- and Hitler going -- 
I f -- reme mber seeing Hitler going through the 
streets with a -- you know, and th
at™s -- I -- I -- maybe I™ve heard it on -- on the radio, cause I 
probably didn™t wi -- ma kes sense 
that I didn™t read the paper, but
 we did have a radio, and you™d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
9 
 
 
hear that screeching voice that 
we all know. Yes, I had strange f
eel -- I -- you certainly did feel 
it, but at the same  ti me , we went to the movies
, and I reme mb er -- what was that place -- and it 
was a -- where there was a big movie theater, in th
e center. It must have been near -- what was 
that [indecipherable] ma in
 street there. Kuda m.  
Q:  Kuf -- K u ffus.  

A: Yeah, Kuffus and da m, yeah, that™s what the 
Berliners call it, Kudam, Krufust and dam, and 
there was a movie that I was -- aside from Sh
irley Temple, I was fascinat ed by the Dionne 
quintuplets, and I can still see like a big advertisement, you 
know, above -- the ma rquis above 
the mo- movie theater, like a painting or -- or 
a photograph, or whatever
, huge, about those five 
quintuplets, and Gene Herschels, 
was an actor or some thing, who played the doctor -- or was he 
the doctor -- I -- I --who -- who delivered them. A
nyway, the whole thing fascinated me . You™re 
bringing out very strang
e things in me , Amy.  
Q: Did you have any experience of some body in Berlin being anti-Semitic toward you, 
personally?  Any recollecti
on of anything like that? 
A: I was always -- I was -- it -- 
it was like a -- like a feeling, like a 
-- I ca -- I can™t 
e -- with -- I -- 
I don™t remember, I don™t reme mber. I -- I -- I don
™t reme mber  anybody calling me  na mes, or I 
mi ght have blocked it -- or hitting me , or sa --
 or anything like that, bu
t it was a feeling of 
caution, and always being told not
 to ma ke waves, be careful, 
don™t do this, don™t do that, and -- 
and that ki nd of thing, it was more that. But I 
guess I felt comfortable as far as anti-Semitism was 
concerned, in the school. Not 
that I was happy in the school. 
Q: Tell me  more about your experiences
 at school. Why weren™t you happy? 
A: I was just not happy in the school. I -- I di
d not -- I was not a good st
udent, I felt very 
isolated, I felt lonely, I fe lt like an unhappy child, 
and -- I -- also I did no
t like Hebrew -- Hebrew 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

lessons. I wasn™t good in it, I didn™t like it, I didn™t
 want to take it. I --
 I was -- I did -- I didn™t 
enjoy school, I didn™t feel popular, you know how 
youngsters have to feel 
popular. All that came  
much later in America. 
Q: Did you talk to your mom or your dad a
bout these feelings, do you reme mber?  Express 
anything to them?  

A: I don™t know. I -- They were not
 that -- those kind of parents as
 they are today, or ma ybe then 
as well, but that™s, I guess, where their age cam
e in. They were very -- not psychologically 
oriented. I don™t think if 
-- if I did, that it didn™t get me  anyw
here. They we re the kind of parents 
that my mot her used to tell me , you know, as 
-- as, I have a headache
 -- children don™t get 
headaches, and that was the end of
 that, and that her mother said
 to her, translating it into 
English, if she had a -- a sore throat, her mother
 would give her a scarf,
 put it around your neck 
and go to school, kind of thing. And -- What else did her mother say?  She™d always tell me  that 

[indecipherable] in a -- pestering her the 
way kids do, I™m thirsty, I™m hungry, I™m hungry. She 
says, ﬁWell then, lick a little salt, and you™ll be
 thirsty, too.ﬂ You know, it™
s sort of in fun, but 
not -- not paying all that much a
ttention to children™s emotions. 
Q: Do you have recollection of the fi
rst time that you learned about Hitler? 
A: No, not really. Her -- I -- I reme mber somethi
ng about -- again, it must be the radio, or my 
parents talking, or people talking, 
about these elections, and that it
™s -- it™ll blow over, or they 
were upset about the election, and I 
don™t even know what year that
 was, ™32 was it, that he came 
into power?  But like most peopl
e said, and like you he -- see 
in movies now, you know, on that 
subject, like it™ll blow 
over, and that crazy guy, and it™s -- an
d that™s just exactly how it was, 
that™s how I reme mber it, that
 this was like an aberration.

Q: But you do actually, at some  point, have more
 me mories of hearing him on the radio, or 
seeing him i n these parades. 
A: Mm. 

Q: What other -- What other me mory is related to Hitler, and maybe some of the either SS 

troopers, or people in th
e street that you saw? 
A: We ll, I -- I reme mber going out to -- my fath
er was very fond of going out to gunavagdet, was 
one of those big parks, park and woods combinati
on, cause Be rlin is very large, and we™d do that 
very often, every Sunday.  Not that -- I didn™t li
ke it, but that™s what we did. And then had to 
have a café in there, and you could sit down and 
have cake, and some thing to drink. And at a 
table very nearby, was Herman Go
ering, with his wife and kids. 
I think he had two. And when 
my father saw that -- and I knew that that was 
like a very bad thing, I -- I f -- without having 
explained too much to me, I don™t know wh-what 
I knew, or what he wa
s going to be doing, but 
he paid the check, and we left there very quick
ly, I do reme mb er that. And I reme mber another 
incident  that -- with my Uncle Heinri ch, my mothe
r™s brother, th -- who had the nerve, or ma ybe 
it was foolishness, to -- when they came  ar
ound with a collection box, when the parade was 
going by, the Nazi parade, that he too -- he had a 
button in his pocket, and he put a button into 
this box instead of money, which was a very da
ngerous thing to do. He told that -- you know, 
seemed like adventuresome, as long as he got away with it. 

Q: Did people, either your parent s, or  other fa
mily me mbers, start talk
ing much about Hitler and 
Nazis in your presence? 

A: I think they tried to shield me . Th-They did tr
y to shield me from all this. It may not have 
been, you know, the mo st demonstrative, a
nd affectionate -- although my mother was 

affectionate -- parents, but I thi
nk they were -- they did want to 
shield me  from this, and things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
12 
 
 
are murky because they didn™t really explain things
, didn™t really talk to me about these things, 
even as I got older, because af
ter all, I was -- by the time we 
were leaving, it -- I was 10. And 
they also spoke -- and this was la
ughable, they spoke in English, in
 fr -- it™s laughable because I -
- when I learned English, I realized how little English they knew, but they talked in so me kind of 
language which I think wa s English, that I s
houldn™t understand. That was one of their, you 
know, ways of -- that™s a -- that™s politics, mone
y, children don™t have to
 know these things, you 
know. And I di -- It wasn™t some
body that I -- I don™t think I fo
und it easy to confide in my 
parents. I -- Actually, I never real
ly did, not to the day they died.  
Q: Did they speak Yiddish at home as well? 

A: No, no Yiddish, no, cause they we re both bo
rn in Berlin, and they -- no Yiddish. 
Q: Do you have any idea how they had learned E
nglish, whatever English they™d learned by that 
point?  

A: Well, I know that th --  a-actually they sent
 me  for -- it wasn™t very long, nor successful, but 
they send me  for some  English lessons, in Berlin
, while I was still there, and ma ybe they had 
taken some  lessons, but I know they had these books
, which I have to this day, I took it from my 
mother™s house, she took it with her when we le
ft, and it™s called towsen
water English, and it™s 
got like little pamphlets in 
a holder, and it™s like, you know, 
when you go to another country, 
those simple phrases, and ma ybe they -- but I can™
t imagine that they just bought them, and were 
self taught, they probably took 
some  lessons, I don™t know why. 
Q: Would you say that your pare
nts, either one or both, were 
very politically interested, or 
involved?

A: I don™t think so. Certainly not my mother. And 
I don™t think my father was either. I think my 
father was interested, you know, as far as th
e newspaper and radio 
is concerned, but not 
politically involved, but interested in 
what was going on, had to be. [inaudible] 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an 
interview with Anita Soc
kol. I was wondering if you 
would tell me more about your vacations with your
 fa mily, also perhaps your visits to camp, as a 
young child. 
A: Those were nice me mories. I reme mber going to
 a resort called Shpindlermueller, which is in 
Czechoslovakia, with my parents, and I -- and I li
ked that very much, and I think I had kids to 
play with there, and beautiful 
scenery, and they also sent me
 to some  ca mp, I don™t reme  -- 
ma ybe it was in -- in the Hartz, A 
-- H-a-r-t-z, or z, I™m not even
 su -- it™s some  kind of mountain 
range, I™ m not sure where it was, but it was a ch
ildren™s camp . And I reme mber one time , this 
was a fond me mory of my father and myself, wh
ich was that one winter afternoon or some thing, 
I came into my parent™s bedroom, and they had 
a surprise for me , and what was the surprise?  
That my fa-father was taking me to -- with th -- ju
st he and I were going aw
ay in the winter, to a 
-- he was going to go skiing or some thing, and he
 was leaving me  at a camp. They had winter 
camps, because in Germany, vacations are diffe
rent than he re. We  didn™t have a summer 
vacation from, you know, all of June, July and 
August. They were shorter, but the winter 
vacations were longer, so you had a winter ca
mp . I don™t know how muc h I enjoyed that camp, 
while learning how to ski, not so much, but I wa sthrilled to go away with him, and I reme mber 

an incident, we were very cold, we got off a tr
ain or some thing, on the way to this camp, and we 
were on a -- like a toboggan with
 some  guy, you know, going through the snow, and it was -- it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
14 
 
 
was great, and I was freezing, and he  got some  bra
ndy or some thing, and he gave me a little sip 
of this to warm me  up, a nd it wa
s just like -- it wa s thrilling, that
™s how I reme m -- reme mber it. 
And then, I guess, eventually he came and picked
 me  up, and ma ybe it was a week or some thing, 
it™s -- I -- I don™t know how
 long. A week, 10 days, in this children™s camp, in the snow, in the 
winter. But it was -- I just felt very pr
ivileged to be alone with my father. 
Q: Do you have an idea of how
 old you were at that point? 
A: I would say about eight, I imagine. Didn™t seem to have anything to do with Nazis, or with 

some thing that you could do, and all these things we
re -- were possible, you know, a -- it™s -- I -- 
I -- I imagine I™m -- would have been
 that age, I don™t th
ink they would have sent me  away much 
younger than that, though it coul dn™t have been t
oo much older, because by 10 -- by 10 years old, 
we were leaving.  

Q: Did  you know of any of the economi c hard times in the early 30™s, taking place in Berlin and 

Germany?  
A: Yes. You mean the -- just the econo mi c hard tim
e -- my father --theywe
re -- in the 20™s if -- 
from what I reme mber my father saying, of course
, I didn™t really know it was -- but he used to 
talk about them all the time . He
™d always tell -- he said, you don™
t know, he said, what in -- oh, 
ma ybe he told it to us -- told it to me  here
, when I was a youngster, that you have no idea what 
real infl ation is like. He sai
d, ﬁWe had baskets full of money,ﬂ and I would picture this. And he 
really meant it literally, like a large basket full 
of money, that was like to
ilet paper, it was like 
devalued ma ybe, you know, monthly, or whatever
. And it took like a -- a shopping bag full to 
buy a loaf of bread, he says, ﬁThat™s what real 
inflation was like,ﬂ that the money was worth -- 
and he s -- and when I say that some  sandwich 
or some thing was a little skimpy, he said -- he 
would always say, ﬁYou don™t know what it was like.
 Whe n I was a boy, we would get a slice of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
15 
 
 
bread, with butter on it, and ther
e would be a like  a smoked piece 
of salami , or some thing, and 
one thin slice, and we™d move 
it around for the flavor, from one end to the other.ﬂ Those were 
the little things, I reme mber he™d 
tell me  these things. But this wa
s like in general, I™d -- I did not 
experience any poverty, and that was really, I guess, 
before. But of course, 
that -- that period of 
time really led to Hitler, we all know that.  
Q: So it seems that while your father was stil
l working, your fa mily™s financial situation was 
stable?  

A: Seems that way to me. It seems to me  that in 
that respect, that my father defi nitely was -- not 
only seems, but you know, I™m -- I™m here to tell th
e story. We™ll always be 
grateful to him that 
he was very farsighted. As I™ve 
said before, he was sort of se
cretive about money and this and 
that, but it seems to me that he must have b
een kind of sophisticated about money and -- and 
maybe had s o me money in -- in Holland, or mayb
e in America, or -- I don™t know ho-how that 
was done, it was never told to me , even later on, wh
en I used to ask, but in some  way, that we 
could ma nage to be self sufficient, and get out 
without another person rea
lly vouching for us. It™s 
-- You know, it was no such thing as welfare, nor w
ould we have dreamt of such a thing, but -- to 
get into the country, but we were 
very, very, very lucky, because as 
I read and see th
ings at Ellis 
Island, reading history and how 
a fe w, you know, percentage-wise,
 how few Jews really were 
able to ge t out and come  here, and be accepted in the United St ates the way we were, and I read 

that it was -- I don™t want to mi nimi z e  the number,
 I forget, was it total 
200,000 or some thing?  It 
was a very small number. Or maybe less, I don™t 
know what that fi -- correct figure wa s, but I 
feel very, very, very fortunate a
nd that [i ndecipherable] in to this
 history in words that I can™t 
even express. As I get older, 
I think about it more and more.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

Q: We re you aware, as a growing child, of the ch
anges once the Nazis came  to powe r?  So there™s 
1933, of course, as a pi votal point in time, when
 Hitler come s to power, 
and then, just to go 
forward for a mo ment, I know that you rema ined with your family in Berlin, until 1938. So, 
during that five year period, approxima tely,what would you say you noticed, if anything, as 

changing, either for your own freedoms, your pa
rents freedoms, for other Jews. Wha t  other 
changes -- you know, did you notice? 

A: We ll, I guess I noticed I -- as I said that
, it was almost you know, that when you see in a 
movie, nowadays with that green smoke, you know, 
when they tried to ma ke some thing like the 
creeping crud, you know, it™s some thi
ng that you just felt, not to ma
ke waves, to -- don™t draw 
attention to yourself. You see th
e Nazis walking around. The -- Then 
there was the issue about -- 
that I knew that my favor ite, Lotte, had to leave,
 and no more ma ids. But as I said, my parents 
were secretive, tryi ng to keep that from me , I 
th -- and my mother became very, very ne rvous 
and depressed, and I think she had what we would 
 really call, in layman™s terms, a nervous 
breakdown, before -- she did not want to leave Berli
n. She really didn™t want
 to leave, and then 
she -- there was a period there when my father 
left -- he left for Holland, because that was -- I 
guess it was beginning of ™38. I don™t know how l
ong he was gone, when he had to leave his 
business. I don™t think he sold it, he split up wi
th his part ner, he had a part ner. Plachte and 
Solomon wa s the name  of the firm, a nd could 
no longer do business, and he left for Holland. 
And my mother sent me to some -- I was on the 
outskirts of Berlin, at some  friends of her™s 
home, with other girls in some room, and I -- I li
ved there for awhile. Oh, and right before that, I 
had my appe ndix taken out, and to this day, I don™
t know if it was really n
ecessary, or if I -- it 
was one of those hysterical things, th
at I drew attention to myself, th
at I said I needed it, I -- that 
I had pain. I -- I don™t kn
ow. But I did have it taken out, and I 
had to -- in those days you stayed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
17 
 
 
in the hospital for a week, you know, with the 
sandbags on the -- on the 
incision. And then I 
went to those -- this house, some body else™s apar
tment, it was sort of out in the suburbs of 
Berlin, while my mother, I guess, did some thing or
 other with the apartment, but I had to be 
away, and -- and then eventually, she and I le
ft to go to join my father, hopefully, but -- 
Q: Did you hear anything about things like the b
oycott in 1933, ma ybe later, since you were so 
young in 1933. Did you hear anything about the boyc
ott against Jewish businesses in 1933, while 
you were in Germany?  
A: In 1933, I was only six years old. I™m just thin
king back. I -- Not per se, and of course they 
didn™t -- in -- in Berlin, I -- I have the impressi
on, ma ybe incorrectly, but I 
think that things in a 
quote unquote, sophisticated urban cent
er like Berlin, that things cam
e more slowly to Berlin, as 
far as, you know, real trouble and pr
ejudice, it -- it came more slowly 
than in the little towns in -- 
in Bavaria, and other littl
e places, where people emigrated mu ch sooner, those that did, and felt it 
more. I think so. So, I -- I™m not sure, but at the 
same  ti me , my -- I would hear my fa ther talking 
with my -- it -- it -- it™s -- it™s a ch -- a ch
ild -- from a child™s impression of -- that he was 
working on some thing, trying -- you know, leaving. 
This was not done overnight, I™m sure. One 
da -- you know, I -- I -- we left ju
st like that, but I™m sure this
 was planned in some  way, and 
secretively. And the children in the school, in the 
classes, they would just sort of disappear. One 
would -- You know, this -- it wasn™t some thing that
 was talked about. They were just, those that 
could, left, and I think it was understood in 
the school, you know, one day would be one, one 
way would be another, and then you found out they
 went to Argentina, or this one went to 
Shanghai or wherever, Australia. Or ma ybe I fou
nd that out afterwards, I don™t -- I™m not sure 
myself.  

Q: Did you ever encounter any Hitler youth? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
18 
 
 
A: Yes, I do reme mber them, and I wanted -- funny 
little things that come to your mi nd, I wanted 
long hair. I wanted my hair in br
aids, just like all those ger -- little
 Germa n girls, and my mother 
wouldn™t let me , because the Hitler youth girls had 
their hair in -- in br aids, and what they called 
uffenshawke r n, which means monke y swings, which 
is if you take a braid, long braid, and then 
you ma ke it -- you double it and ma ke a loop, and then they had bows, you know, and kind of 
cute, and I admi red it, but she would never let 
me have my hair long, 
which bothered me , and I 
did see a lot of Hitler youth, young boys and girls. 
I reme mbe r  their outfits with the -- with the 

kerchief and a leather knot, sort of like 
boy scouts, and yet not 
like boy scouts, oh yes. 
Q: Do you reme mber asking about the Hitler yout
h, and -- and who were they, and what they 
did?  Did you reme mber any discus
sions with friends or family? 
A: Now that you me ntion it -- you have such inte
resting questions, but I 
-- I think I did. But, I 
think I was told again, in -- in
 that secret way, like -- like 
you know, some body say, it™s not for 
you, don™t ask, don™t -- li -- it was some thing bad, but 
I don™t think they went 
into detail, I don™t 
think. Don™t reme mber any specific answers. 

Q: Although, what you were just describing about 
the braids, and that you wanted braids -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- like that, do you think that you -- do you thi
nk that your mother actually told you, you can™t 
have these braids because they are Hitler you --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- I mean, did she connect the braids with Hitler youth? 

A: Yes, I think she did, I think she did, and she ha
d my hair shingled in the back, just the way I 
always hated it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

Q: So as you were growing a little bit older asa child, were you aware of
 any official growing 
restrictions on Jew™s freedoms?  The Nuremberg laws
 in ™35, and any other 
restrictions?  I realize 
that you were at a Jewish school, 
but of course some  -- some  pe
ople were not allowed to go to 
swimming pools, you know, certain things that mayhave affected you if you were not, perhaps, 
in a Jewish school. 

A: I think they ch -- my parents must have 
tried to circumvent that, you know, that if you 
couldn™t go to a pool, then we went out to Vunzi, or
 -- or for some  -- there were a lot of lakes and 
-- and things, outside of Berli
n. It™s a huge city, you know, and 
it™s surroundings. Remember all 
these outings, and going to rowboats and stuff with 
my father, and I have pictures of myself in -- 
name  come s  to mi nd, and that -- one
 of the pictures that I just 
gave you, in a place called Pinz, 
but that was a resort, yeah, you know in bay -- I d
on™t have the f -- I -- except for those, what 
happened later on with the yellow benches, in -- in
 that -- by Rushanplatz, and it was not safe to 
play there any more, and that you had to pay to
 sit down, or some thing, that some how was, for 
my mother, you know, i-it was like the end, like 
some thing was really happening, but they did 
shield me from it. 
Q: Can you describe mo re what you reme mber fr om that time period, with respect to the 

benches?  

A: Ah, it™s -- this is before you had to wear a 
star, that happened late
r, but the benches -- and 
there were benches in the park 
that were painted yellow, for Je
ws to sit on, and it wa s like, you 
know, when, from out of nowhere, you know, now in re
trospect it ma y not seem so terrible, but 
if you imagi ne it, you know, it was like a noose ti
ghtening, it just seemed incredible, you know, 
and -- and who is going to sit on those benches?  A
nd I -- I do reme mber that
, and that must have 
been shortly -- I™m sure there were other things 
happening at the time , oth-
other restrictions, but I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
20 
 
 
don™t reme mber what they were. I ju -- I just can
™t think of it, but it -- it just felt very 
uncomfortable, you know, every day. And my c ousin
s, I didn™t see them -- my cousin, rather, 
just one, because my other cousins lived elsewher
e, lived in different cities, Kreenesbergen. But 
the one that I me ntioned, my fath
er™s brother™s -- the Plachtes, 
she had problems in her school, 
too, but I don™t reme mbe r  what they really were. 
Q: Do you reme mber sitting on 
one of those benches yourself? 

A: No. I think that m- my  -- my moth
er didn™t allow it, we wouldn™t do it. 
Q: And was there a fee associated with 
those who would sit on those benches? 
A: I don™t think so, no.  

Q: You told me  a little bit about friends that you reme mber, and I™m wondering, as you were 

getting a little bit older now, and before you le
ft Berlin, if you reme mber
 any other friendships 
from that time  period, or ma ybe you™ve already to
ld me of the friends you reme mber the most, 

but from your sort of seven year old,
 eight year old, nine
 year old period. 
A: The people that I remember were mainly in that
 class, they were all girls, because it was -- I 
guess it was all girl™s classes, boys must have been 
in a different class, and if I had that picture 
that I have of -- several pi ctur e -- I™d -- I don™t 
think they™re here, I think 
I have them at home, I 
can name  those girls quite well. And 
what -- what did you ask me , about -- 
Q: Just wondering if there were 
any other friend-friendships that
 you remember from this time 
fra me, of be ing around seven year old, you know, se
ven, eight, nine year
s old in Berlin, or 

ma ybe you a l ready covered that before, 
when I asked about friends before. 

A: We ll, you know, I gave the Holocaust Museum 
my autograph album, and in there you can see 
what they wrote, you know, and in those days it
 was not done like here, it
 was really some thing. 
When you gave some body an autograph album, they
 took it home , they wrote very carefully, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
21 
 
 
they drew little pi ctur es, or -- or  put on decals,
 and as you can see, it™s really quite interesting, 
and they didn™t take it lightly, 
not scribbled in, as you can see the 
contrast, you™ll see fa -- I have 
some  from junior high school in New York, and 
you just scribbled whatever. I wish you -- I wish 
you luck, I wish you that, da-da da-da, and one
 15, and just we nt on, you know, from public 
school to junior high school. No 
gus -- A-And you could -- Some  of
 them sort of wished me  
well, and when you read the poems in German, you r
ealize that they were 
-- it was sort of like 
the end of some thing, like they were -- we were
 going to part, you say, we
ll, we™re just little 
girls, it wasn™t like we were 
going on to high school, or some thi
ng. It was like as if we were 
going to part. 

Q: What™s the first time you reme mb er your pa
rents talking to you a
bout the possibility of 
leaving your home , leaving Berlin? 

A: Again, an interesting question. I really don™t 
reme mber, yi -- they were, again, not the kind of 
parents that would discuss anything 
with me , and I just -- and I neve
r really questioned it, even in 
my -- until my young adulthood. You know, they were 
what they were, and I had to do what they 

said, and I was not -- my opinion was not consid
ered, or -- it was like a 
fait accompli. And, but I 
think by the time I went where my mother send me, 
to that home that seems so blurry in my 
mi nd, with these other girls who 
lived there, I know some body 
a -- I guess she was unraveling 
her apartment situation, or sel
ling furniture, or -- 
I don™t know what she was doing while I was 
away in the suburbs. That™s when 
I realized -- and also at -- at
 the same time, I was recovering 
from that appendix surgery, whic
h was quite some thing the way th
ey -- old-fashioned way that 
they did it in those days. That™s 
when I realized that 
things were really ch
anging, that™s what I 
seem to remember. And then she came and got 
me , but I don™t reme mbe r  any real discussions 

that we were -- nor did -- let me  say at this poin
t ,  tha t  t h e y  ne ve r  e xpe ct
ed to go anywhere but to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
22 
 
 
Holland. That was the end of the journey, hopefully th
at we were going to ge
t there, cause that™s 
where my father was, they had no intention of goi
ng to America, or anywhere else. That seemed 
far away enough, which sounds cr
azy today, but not then.  
Q: I™m wondering as you grew up in Berlin, di
d you ever get in trouble with your parents? 
A: I™m sure that I did. I™m sure 
that I did, yeah. It di
dn™t take much, my fa ther had quite a temper, 
and my mother would often say, ﬁLudwich dus ki
ns,ﬂ [indecipherable], cause he had quite a 
temper and he would smack me  and whatnot, yeah, 
and my mother would try to shield -- shield 
me  from hi m, you know, cause he was -- didn™t 
--  he had a short fuse. He was a good ma n, but 
not cut out for raising a very young child. He wa
s already very set in his ways, you know, and 
very German. I had a parak -- I was very lonely that
 I -- I w -- I said that before, but I wanted a 
sister, or a brother, or a dog, or 
a cat, in that order. And I us
ed to have recurring -- recurrent 
dreams about that, very, very often, and I felt ve
ry -- I really wanted 
that desperately, one -- 
when I never got it -- didn™t get any of them. I 
never got a pet either, except for a parakeet, which 
thrilled me , and then one day he -- we  let him 
out of the cage, and I don™t know what was wrong 
with this bird, I thought he flew
 around the room, but he s -- fl
ew into the walls until he dropped 
dead, and I -- it was very trauma tic for me , it really
 was, cause that little 
parakeet -- and that was 
the end of my pets. 
Q: Did you ever ask your mother or father for a sibling? 

A: Yes, yes, I did. But my mother always told 
me, I don™t know if she to
ld me  this then -- no, 
probably not, I was too young, but later, that, she sa
id, ﬁWell, in Hitler ti
me this is -- it was 
fashionable, everybody -- everybody just had one 
child, cause you never knew what was going to 
happen.ﬂ That™s wh -- I guess she told me  that later on. And then I found out much later on, 

which ma de me  very angry, that she™d had an abortion after me, and she knew it was a -- a ma le 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
23 
 
 
child, and -- but by that time, I didn™t care, you 
know, any more. Maybe I 
was ma rried by then, I 
don™t know. But she alwa ys used to tell me  -- and ind
eed, a lot of the kids th
at I knew, they were 
single ch-children. Not all, but a lot. 
Q: Do you have recollecti
on of the 1936 Olympics? 
A: Yes, I do. I do reme mber that. I reme mber 
the hoopla, and I am te mpted to say I saw it on 
television, but of course that wa
sn™t true. But I do reme mber it, now how do I reme mbe r  it? I 
don™t know, but I do remember it, and I reme mbe r  ge
tting one of those Olympic pins. I was very 

proud of that, you know, with the Ol
ympic circles, and -- and I -- I 
reme mber it, maybe it was in 
the newspaper or ma gazines. Surely it was, it mu
st have been a very bi
g thing in Berlin. And I 
even seem to reme mber some -- I don™t know, was it 
then or was it later, 
it™s hard -- some thing 
about, you know, what turned out to be Jesse 
Owens and Hitler™s disappointment that he won, 
you know, a bl -- a Bl ack man, cause I reme mber th
at you rarely saw one, I 
-- there were, once in 
a blue moon, on the street in Berlin, you w
ould see a -- a Black pers
on, and you™d say, ﬁAh, a 
nigger.ﬂ It wa s like seeing some
body with two heads, it was just 
-- you just didn™t 
see that. But I 
do reme mbe r  the Olympics and the -- everything 
that -- the excitement 
that it was -- you know, 
that involved in it, probably ba
nners, and who knows what. I can™t
 say I went there, but I do 
r e me mb e r  i t .   

Q: So most of your recollections
 would be positive, if you -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- for instance, didn™t know about what ma y ha
ve been happening with Jewish athletes, with 
African-American athletes, you had 
mostly positive associations of
 the Olympics at that time , 
right?  

A: I think so, yeah, I think so.

Q: Did you know anything about the anschluss in Ma
rch of ™38, which I rea
lize is very soon to 
when you would up leaving Berlin, corre
ct?  Did you leave in April of ™38? 
A: Yes. 
Q: From Berlin? 

A: Left in April of ™38, for Holland. Was the 
anschluss at that point, or was it after? 
Q: March of ™38.  

A: March of ™38. Yeah, I -- I do reme mber that th
ings got really, really bad, you know, that like a 
no-noose tightening, and that we were
 -- we had to go, and that it seemed like the right thing to 
do, you know, as far as my mother was concerned, 
or whatever was happening there. And her 
speaking to her brother, some th
ing about her brother [indecipher
able] and his wife. I didn™t see 
them very much. Now that I thi -- I don™t even 
know where they lived, did they live in Berlin?  
Heinrich Schindler , and my little cousin Margit.
 I never even me ntioned her til now. Also one 

child, and my c -- the other cousin, one child. An
d my Aunt Kate, one child, my cousin Ernest, 
who died recently in -- in Manchester, England. 
And who else?  My cousin in Israel, one child, 
MaryAnn from my mother™s sister Ann -- Anna. Th
ere were -- In other words, ther e were three 
girls and one boy. Heinrich, my mot her Margaret, 
her sister Kate, who we
nt to Theresienstadt. 
Her sister Anna, who managed to go to Palestine.
 And each one of them had one child, so ma ybe 

that™s -- I accepted this one child
 situation ma ybe because of th
em, but where did Margit live? I 
know that -- that they didn™t ma ke it, and I am going to look it
 up, either today, or soon, what 
happened to them. But my mother was concerne
d about him, was he ill, he had a nervous 

breakdown or some thing, all at that time when
 we were leaving. But you know, I was 10, and 
they didn™t talk to me , so that™s why it™s difficu
lt, besides the me mory, of course. But they really 
didn™t di scuss these things with me.

Q: Did you have any favorite hobbies or activities as a child in Berlin? 
A: We ll, I loved going to the movies, which of cour
se wasn™t very often, bu
t love it, I love it to 
this day. And I was absolutely crazy about Shir
ley Temple. She seemed to personify everything 
glamorous, and -- you know, the way people felt about Amer ica and Hollywood, and I had, not a 

Shirley Temple doll, but I got those -- I guess th
ey were all made for -- for export, like a paper 

dolls, and then you cut them out, and put the clothe
s on -- on the -- and I played with it for hours. 
And then of course, what I had, the wa y ba -- the 
way kids here have baseball cards, this was my 
prize possession, they we re actual black andwhite photographs of Shirley Temple in these 

different mo vies that she was in, which came in 
sets like baseball cards, and I bought them, and I 

have a -- and I had a photograph album of he
r, and also I collected another -- it was a young 
Austrian movie star, her name  was Trowdel Star
k. And I have this album, I took it with me , I 
have it to this day, and I proba
bly -- probably nobody else would 
have it. I should write Shirley 
Temple Bla c k and tell her about her album. And once in awhile, when I see these movies on TV, 
for instance when she™s wearing a -- when she wa
s seven or eight, whatever, and wearing a satin 
pajama  with appliqued bunnies on it, and I™ll look
 at her in this scene,
 I say, ﬁOh, my God, I™ve 
seen this picture, this photogr
aph of her in that particular 
outfit so ma ny times, leafing through 
my album. And you™re not getting that album. 
Q: Did your fa mily identify as being German as well as Jewish? 

A: I would say so, yes, I would say so. It didn™t
 seem at the time  that there was anything wrong 
with it. My father fought in World War One. He f
ought in the Austrian arm
y, as a ma t t er of fact.

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an 
interview with Anita Sockol. Would you continue 
telling me  about your family identifying as Germans?  
A: We ll, I -- I really, you know, it™s -- I™m sort 
of embarrassed to talk about it, because it isn™ t 
very nice, but it™s the truth, it
™s the way mo -- ma ny Ger mans felt.
 I know I have this feeling, 
from my father especially, that he -- you could a
lmost say it™s almost lik
e an anti-Semitic feeling 
about Jews from eastern Europe, you know, with
 payess, and with, you know, that kind of 
clothi ng, and all the other accout rements, I had that 
feeling, carrying it over to Ame r ica, that he 
felt like he was a different kind of Jew, very 
secular. And didn™t really -- And s-spoke no 
Yiddish, I don™t think they were brought up with that. We  ate 
-- my mother™s cooking was not 
particularly wonderful, not everybody™s mother 
is a good cook, or a great housekeeper. But when 
we came here, and I learned, you know, about all th
ese Jewish dishes, I wa s not used to them 
because I never grew -- I never grew up with them
 -- with these things from eastern Europe like 
latkas and chopped liver and kasha varnishkas, 
and -- and -- or anything that was -- you know, 
that people ma ke, that when they™re kosher, it 
was very strange to me . And so I would say that 
that -- ma ybe that™s also why I don™t reme mber a
ny -- I don™t reme mber any seders, per se, in my 
house. Whe n we went to seders, they were in Ne
w York, in the early days, people that they me t. 
Now, we we re refugees, and we were at other 
people™s houses, but it™s not some thing that we 

had. And yet, we did go to synagogue some wher e. I 
-- It™s not clear. I th
ink that™s something I 
would reme mber. 

Q: Did your fa mily observe Shabbat? 

A: No, definitely not.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
27 
 
 
Q: Will you tell me  whe n you learned that your fa
ther ha d to stop working, and what you learne d 
about that at the time ?  
A: He -- He could no longer run his busine
ss, you know, it -- he was self-employed, and I 
reme mber something about his br
eaking up with his partner, ma ybe
 the partner was leaving, or 
ma ybe he s -- was still able to buy him out, or sell it,
 or leave it. It™s not cl
ear, but I know that he 
had to leave that business, and 
I don™t know if, in 1938, he c -- he could sell the business for any 
kind of -- you know, that had any value, or he just
 had to walk away from it. This, again, was not 

some thing that they told me . 
And same  with the apartment, you know, I don™t reme mber. No one 

ever came to look at it, or to rent it, or 
you know, and that we would leave the way you would 
norma lly do now, if -- it wasn™t that 
kind of leaving. I think we  just 
left it, that™s what people did. 
And my mother had a nervous br
eakdown over her new dining room set, I reme mber that she did 
not want to leave her dining room set behind. We
 just took some  things, you know, that were -- 
that seemed -- that™s how I ended 
up with these pictures that I ha
ve in my autograph album, and 
my Shirley Temple album, cause those little things
 were important to me . But, we did not move 
with -- with furniture, no.  

Q: Do you reme mber the process of packing? 

A: No. I think that™s when I was in this other home, don™t remember the process of packing, and 

I was just thinking about it before you aske
d me , but you know, they™re perfectly logical 
questions, but for some  reason, I don™t reme mbe r  any of that. 

Q: I read from your telephone interview su
mmar y, some thing about you seeing an image of 
Hitler in, I believe your superint endent, the bu
ilding superint endent™s home. Can you tell me  
about that incident? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
28 
 
 
A: Yes, I do reme mber that, cause that was very s
cary to me . For some  reason, I used to go to -- I 
was friendly with the superintendent of the build
ing -- with the wife of the superintendent, I 
don™t remember him at all, but I do reme mber 
her, and I remember her name. She was a -- I 
guess a mi ddle aged woma n, with grown sons. I th
ink she had three children. She mus t  have had 
a younger one that I played with, and for some  
reason, often after school,
 my mother wasn™t 
home , I would ring her bell, and I would have some
 cookies and milk, or some refreshment, and 
she was very  nice to me . And one day, everythi
ng changed. I walked into her living room, and I 
se -- now I saw a huge picture of Hitler over he
r couch in her living room, and her older boys 
were in SS uniforms, and I knew what that meant, they were in black uniforms, and they were 
very tall. Course I was just a 
little kid, I mean they seemed like, you know, really me n, scary 
young me n in that dreaded SS uniform. And then my
 mother told me I can™t go there any more, 
and it impressed me  somehow. I was really frightened.  

Q: What was her name? 
A: Mrs. Tetslaff. Yeah, st
range how you reme mb er that. 
Q: Do you reme mber her being mean to you? 
A: No, but -- not mean, but he
r attitude changed. Colder. 
Q: Do you reme mber saying goodbye to any of your 
friends before you left Berlin?  Did you have 

that opportunity to do so? 

A: Only those girls in that home. Wa s there any 
of my f -- any of my cl
ose friends there?  I don™t 
know who those girls were, sleeping in a room with th
ree or four girls, I don™
t -- I just -- it™s all 
so weird. And I felt very strange, I knew that 
some thing was very wrong, and -- and about to 
change, but really I -- I do reme mber saying good
bye to the Le rventhals, Hilda Lerventhal in 
some  way, or ma ybe they left first, I don™t know. I-It™
s a feeling that is hard to explain, because  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
29 
 
 
you don™t -- it™s all in retrospect, 
and you -- just things were cha
nging, but it™s -- it
™s not like in 
the movies, you know, that you say goodbye, a
nd you hug each other, and -- because nobody 
really knew what was going to happen next, or wh
ere they were really going, or for how long, 
cause you didn™t know what was going to happen. 
Q: So, when did you leave Berlin for the outskirts
, where you were staying in this home?  When 
was that, and how long do you think you were there?
 What -- What are the me mories that you 
have of being there? 

A: I reme mb er being there, I would say about a 
month, some thing like that. And also I reme mber 
that that appendix surgery was -- it was not a good 
time, it was er -- already dangerous for me  to 
ha -- you know, have a doctor operate on me . My 
mother was not happy with this whole thing, 
and I would say it all must ha
ve been at the beginning of 1938, some where between the 
beginning of 1938, and then April, I think we left in
 April of 1938. Can really 
tell -- I have given 
you -- I just thought of it, pictures
 I -- I -- actually, you have th
e actual passports, and you could 
check in the passport when that re
al ly  w a s ,  i f  my  me mo r y  i s  in c o
rrect by the dates that they put 
in there. And of course that was the other thing a
bout the passports, that we 
had a s -- a statenloss 
passports, stateless, no more Germa n. So there 
was another thing, I do reme mber my  mother 
telling me , and I also have my 
own passport. One day I will find 
it in my apartment, and when I 
do, I will give it to the Holocaust Museum, but I™v
e looked high and low, I can™t find it. But you 
have several, you have my father™s and one with 
a German passport, and one with the stateless. 
And I think my mother™s as 
well, if I™m not mi staken. 
Q: So, by the time you left your home in Berlin, 
your father had already left for Holland. And 
what did you know about your father 
at this -- at this point in time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
30 
 
 
A: Nothing really, that we  were going on this --
 we™re going to meet him 
in Holland, and I have a 
feeling like it was going to be, 
once we got there, like it was going 
to be pleasant. We were going 
to a resort that was ou -- on th
e outskirts of The Hague, called 
Tre-Treverningen. That™s how the 
Dutch pronounce it, I believe. And 
it was a -- a beach resort that 
was sort of -- Treverningen to 
The Hague, is like Atlantic City
 is to Philadelphia. You know, 
nearby. And it had a pier, like an 
amuse ment pier, and a big beach, and we were 
living in a boarding -- 
we™re going to -- well, 
that™s when I got there, but the trip going, 
was -- was dangerous, that I do reme mber. Do you 
want me  to tell you about that? 

Q: Sure, and when -- when was that? So you me t up with your mother for that? 

A: That was -- wi -- yeah. I me t up with my mo
ther for that. I guess I -- she took me back to 
Berlin, or you know, we left, you 
know, by train, and I guess we didn™
t have very much with us. 
What could it have been?  I mean, 
suitcases, can™t carry more. And we™re in the train, and she was 
very nervous about the border, and she told me  
not to talk, not to say anything, bec -- cause you 
know how they come  in at a border, first you -- 
the Germans come  in, and then the other country, 
in this case it was Dutch. And we
 we re in a town called Bedtime fi rst, and these people sort of 
hid us. We  were there one or two nights. And it 
was a border town, and we stayed in -- in an 
attic, and we did not come  down for meals or a
nything. They were very nice, I guess it was in 
Germany, a nd they -- they hid us, 
even in those days. And then 
-- I don™t know quite why -- why 
we couldn™t go directly to Ber
lin -- to Holland, but we didn™t. And then we ma de a connecting 
train on another day, and that™s when these --
 these German Nazis came in. There was a 
conductor, German, you know, regular conductor, 
but then the Nazis came  in, looking at your 
passport, or officers of some  sort
, and my mother said, ﬁDon™t say an
ything.ﬂ And I, of course -- 
she se -- he said, ﬁHow old are you?ﬂ And I sa
id, ﬁI™m -- I™m -- I™m 10, but my mother said I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
31 
 
 
should say I™m nine,ﬂ or some thing like that. 
And my mother thought she would die, she was 
ready to kill me , cause any di
screpancy could, you know, if -- I don™t know why I did that, or -- 
it was one wa y or the other, but it -- they let it 
slide, but I remember that, and I reme mber how I 
felt inside, that I knew I ma de a big mi stake, but th
at™s kids. And then we did get there, and then 
my father met us. Where we were, I don™t know. Ma
ybe went directly to that town, to -- or 
ma ybe it was in The Hague, and then got to it 
-- but we stayed in a boarding house until -- 
through the summer -- spring and summer of 
1938, til we left for New York, and -- 
Q: The boarding house was in this resort? 
A: Yes. It was like i-in a house, you know in 
a -- a boarding house. The reason I say boarding 
house is what I reme mb er is that we had these 
communal me als, and as a ma tter o -- there was an 
actor at -- there, at that boardi
ng house, at -- I didn™t know it the
n, but I since then saw hi m the -- 
he was in many, ma ny American musicals. His name was S.Z. Sakall, S-a-k-a-l-l, or some thing, 

and he was called Cuddles in a lot of movies. 
He was in movi es, you know, in musicals with 
Betty Grable, and Don Ameche and played a -- the 
roly-poly, good-natured funny role in lots of 
movies, but he was emigrating, 
and we had these communal meal
s, you know, like in a boarding 
house, which I™ve never had before.  

Q: Did you get the impression that other people th
ere besides him were al
so planning to leave, 
planning to emigrate from there?  Wa s this a pl
ace for people to gather who were trying to 
emigrate? 

A: I didn™t know. I didn™t really 
know what we were doing, again th
e secretiveness, the secrecy, I 
should say, until -- oh, I must say an
 asi -- a footnote, I saw -- 
everybody ha s bicycles in Holland, 
you know, and we saw the queen, Queen Wilhel mi na and her daughter, riding around on her 

bicycle, and -- very, very casual, 
not like England. One day, my fa
ther said that he was going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
32 
 
 
Rotterdam, to see if he™d get tickets to come  to
 -- to go to New York, th
at he -- and the reason, I 
guess by that time they told me  that much, that he
 could not -- he was und
er the impression that 
he could work there, or start a business, or so
me thing, but he could not. 
It wasn™t permitted. So, 
it would have been just  a question of time un
til his money would run out, so he went to 
Rotterdam, he said he wa s going to Rotterdam to s
ee if we get tickets to go to New York, that™s 
how it seemed. And if we could, we would, and if not
, not. It seemed so casual, like if we can get 
theater tickets we™d go, and if we can™t, we can™t
. And he came back a day 
or two later, and he 
had tickets to -- on -- on a ship called the Starte
ndam, and we went. And when I™d ask him about 
this, you know, years later my daughters would alwa
ys urge me , ﬁTalk to Papa, talk to Papa. Ask 
him how this happened.ﬂ But he never wanted 
to talk about it, you know, he™d always say, 
ﬁAch,ﬂ you know, ﬁstop, I don™t want
 to,ﬂ -- you know, he™d gesture 
with his hand, and he al -- 
he™d say, ﬁAch, you think it was easy?  Ah, it wasn™t easy.ﬂ So I presume what he me a nt by that 
was bribes. What else could it ha
ve been, you know?  But he must have had the foresight to have 
money or whatever, cause that™s the onl
y way you got anywhere in those days. 
Q: Wa s there any problem with 
you having the stateless passports, 
you and your parents, at this 
point?  

A: No, I guess they were good for some thing, in -- at that time, y-you have to reme mb er, it 

changed like monthly, or less. 
You know, there were always ne
w -- I™m sure they would have 
been worthless. I -- I mean in -- that was Septem
ber. We  arrived here in New York, in September 
-- on September 18
th
, 1938, and the Crystal Night was not even two mo nths later. So, the timi ng 
was very, very fortuitous. And we we re hear
ing things, we were hearing things, you know, 
reading things about, I guess the -- I -- I -- I -- we
ll, not the anschluss, 
but Hitler going into the 
other countries, or ma ybe it was 
right after, because my
 father, very soon after we got here, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
33 
 
 
first thing that he did was to ge
t -- send tickets to my Uncle Mart
in, and his wife and my cousin 
Ilsa, the ones in Berlin, for him to ge -- to -- to 
emigrate to Shanghai. For some  reason or other, 
that was easier. Couldn™t get her 
to the United Stat es, but that wa
s possible, but they didn™t use 
them, they didn™t use them. And I have found out si
nce, here at the muse
um, that unfortunately 
they were all killed in Auschw
itz, the three of them. 
I sa -- I looked it up, and it was very -- it 
was very sad, and to -- to actually see 
it, you know, on paper. I never knew.  
Q: What was the trip like to the United States? 

A: The trip, the way I reme mber it, was quite pl
easant. I me an, it was a -- I guess a Dutch ship, 
and it was, you know, just on the cusp of some thing, th
ey were -- it was a real
 -- it was a -- it -- it 
was like going on shi -- on a ship. It was not a re
fugee ship, we were going second class, which I 
realized not long a -- not long ago, when I went 
to Ellis Island, and I was listening with the 
headset to To m Brokaw, I found out why I never we
nt to Ellis Island, because we were -- I never 
knew, we just got off the ship when we got
 here, and cousins, you know, second cousins, 
whatever, we re waiting for us here. But the reason
 was, if you weren™t in third class, you didn™t 
have to go to Ellis Island. That™s what he sa
id, and -- but it was quite pleasant. I reme mber 
meeting this American family, w
ith their children, who had gone 
to Europe on vacation, cause it 
was, you know, early September, summer vacation with their children, and they befriended me  

because the mother, the father, they wanted thei r 
children to meet a little 
-- a real little German 
girl. And I reme mber they took me  into the lounge
 of the ship, for a -- in-into the cocktail lounge 
in the afternoon, for a drink. And this drink turned
 out to be som -- it was horrible, and it turned 
out to be Coca-Cola, which was some thing that I ha
d never -- i-it™s a very, 
very strange flavor, if 
you™ve never ever had it, and I 
don™t like it to this day. But -- A
nd then I -- My mother bought 
me  -- I had it til not so long ago, a 
little sailor doll 
from that ship, with a -- 
with a little sailor hat, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
34 
 
 
the way they had them, you know, a little white, lik
e a little brechen is 
it? And the little black 
ribbon around it, with the name  of 
the ship, and it was like a little 
stuffed doll, with velvet, and I 
lu -- I wanted it desperately, I want
ed this doll, and they did get it for me , and I had it for years 
and years and years, you know, little sailor from - -  
as a souvenir. I do not ha -- reme mber this as 
an unpleasant sh -- sh -- it wa -- 
it wa s like going -- sort of like on some  kind of vacation. I me an, 
I didn™t know the difference, I™d never been on a 
ship before, maybe it was pretty -- I wouldn™t 
say primitive, but maybe Spartan, but it -- it seemed fi ne to me. 
Q: Did you know that you were mo ving 
to another country at that point? 
A: I must have, but I -- it™s -- for some  reas
on, it has like no -- no me mor
y, or no great me aning. 
I -- I -- I -- I just -- of course I must have
 known, I mean, we were going to -- but it had no -- I 

didn™t know what -- what to expect. 

Q: What do you reme mb er first seeing? 

A: What I -- First seeing, I re
me mbe r  getting -- I don™t really
 recall s -- bei
ng o -- seeing the 
Statue of Liberty, like in the movies, I guess it™s
 all mi xed up with a million documentaries that  
I™ve seen. But I do reme mber the pier, getting 
off the ship, and I guess they did have people 
comi ng onto the ship, you know, it wasn™t such 
-- you didn™t just get off. People who -- you 
know, health examiners, or whatever, you know, and 
-- were looking at your 
papers, it™s a whole 
process, and then eventually ge
tting off on this huge pier in Ne
w York, and then getting into 
these relatives™ car. These relatives were my mother™s relatives, and -- who were -- the -- the 

woma n was the sister of 
Arthur Fiedler, the conductor of 
the Boston Pops, which didn™t me an 
anything to me  at the time . And I reme mber get -- 
driving from the pier to 
this --  wher ever we 
stayed in that first apartment that they rented 
for us --  probably did, and I said some thing ab -- 
you know, I said, ﬁOh, these skyscrap
ers, they™re not so
 tall,ﬂ or something like that, I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
35 
 
 
having expected -- ﬁThey don™t seem like anythi
ng so big.ﬂ I reme mber saying some thing like 
that.  
Q: In Germa n? 

A: In Germa n, of course, I didn™t speak a word of
 English, not a word. It wa s always just done.  
Q: Can you tell me  the date on whic
h you arrived to the United States? 
A: Yes, that was a day after my birthday, it was Se ptember 18
th
, 1938, I do reme mber that very 
well. 

Q: How old did you turn that year? 

A: 11 on that day. 

Q: Do you reme mber your birthday on the ship? 

A: That mus t  be when I got the sailor doll, I th
ink, as a present. Yeah, my birthday was always 
you know, to me , a big deal. After all, I was an onl
y child, and children like their birthdays, so I 
think that probably celebrated 
it in some manner on the ship. 
Q: What do you reme mb er about starting school 
in the United States, in New York City?  
Correct? 

A: Mm, yes, I do reme mber -- I remember the s 
-- the school ve ry well. Eventually, after a fe w 

years, we moved across the street from that schoo
l, but at -- the first apartment was, I reme mber 
the address, 650 We st 172
nd
 Street. That was off between 
Broadway and Fort Wa shington 
Avenue, and the public school, PS 173 was on the 
corner of Fort Wa shington Avenue and 173
rd
 
Street, so I just had to wa lk dow -- you know, 
two blocks, one down and one across. I reme mber 
an interview, vaguely. My father taking me  to 
school, and they telling me , whoever, maybe it 
was the principal, that -- what grade they were pu
tting me  into. They put me into four A. In those 
days the seme sters were split up, A and B, ha-hal
f a year, you know, not lik
e fourth grade, A and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
36 
 
 
B. So it was the beginning of the f-fourth year, 
four A, which was five sem -- five seme sters less 
than what I should have been in, two and a half 
years. And they said th
at when I would learn 
English, that it would be sort of
 automa tic that I would catch up 
with mys e lf, which was not true. 
And I reme mber feeling very -- feeling very 
bad about that, you know, 
w-with -- with these 
young kids. Again, it™s -- it™s a filmy kind of drea
my me mory, seeing myself in that class, but I 
was not happy to be with childre
n that were that much younger, 
and I didn™t speak any English, 
and also, I don™t reme mber other children that
 I was -- could be frie
nds with, or drawn to, 
because there were other little Germ
an girls or  boys in the class. It was just  me. So I guess they 
came later, or at other times.
 And eventually I did become  a very good student, and it was only 

because of that that I skipped a lot of grades, and I wen -- went  to summer school some where in -

- you know, before finishing public school, that I ma
de up at least a year or two, and then I -- 
then in junior high school, I was 
put in what they called RA, it 
was called rapid advance classes, 
you know, for kids who were doing well, and made 
it two years out of three, or some thing like 
that. But in the end, after high sc
hool, graduating high school, I just a 
pi -- I came  out just about 
right, so if I hadn™t been, I™d be going 
to school til I was 
-- the end of my 18
th
 year, I think. But 
school, I reme mber my f -- early on,
 I had to -- I came home  with a poem, which I had to learn 
by heart. And my father, as I told
 you, was -- didn™t have much patie
nce, and I just couldn™t get it 
into my head, I couldn™t seem to grasp it, th
e engli -- an-and he smacked me , you know, for 
again not getting it right, and it turn
ed out to be ﬁThe Star Spangl
ed Banner,ﬂ that™s what that 
poem was. I didn™t enjoy school ats --
 at first, but the kids were -- 
I -- I guess they 
were all -- all 
right. I -- I don™t remember, I don™t reme mber them
 being particularly --
 I felt isolated, but I 
don™t reme mber being, you know, taunted, or -- part
icularly one way or a
nother, particularly 
cruel, or -- but isolated. And early on, goi
ng to the -- as a school
 outing, going to the 1939

World™s Fair, that was very thrilling. I re -- 
I remember doing that, and 
enjoyable. And I think I 
only did it once after that, on my own with fami
l y or some body else. But once I got the language, 
then -- and also I was becomi ng a teenager, I be ca
me a much happierchil
d, and really sort of 
found myself, which wasn't  easy with my pa
rents and these circumstances, you know, little 
apartment and I was -- I felt -- I never had a room
 of my own, I slept in
 the living room. My 
parents never had a bedroom again, ever. The othe
r room wa s -- was had always two rooms, and 
it was sort of like a -- with two couches in it, 
each -- they slept separate
ly, sort of like a studio, 
like you some ti me s get in a motel, L-shaped, one c
ouch here, one couch there. In that apartment 
as well as the next apartment, as
 well as their last apartment, l
ong after I was ma rried. And I slept 
in the living room, I was -- this 
is sort of personal, has -- I don
™t know, mu ch to do with anything 
on this subject, but I was always -- we ll, I guess 
sort of ashamed of the way we lived, and also, 
you know, I didn™t -- the friends that I eventually 
made, their apartments seemed much nicer, and 
they had sisters and brothers. It was not all 
that happy at home, and my mother was working 
right from the beginning here. My father, on the ot
her hand, wa sn™t. He -- I guess he came  with a 
little too mu ch money, t hat he didn™t need to be
 forced into taking a job, or -- or getting -- or 
starting all over, or like most
 of their friends -- friend™s husbands did. Some  of the m were 
doctors, and they started off, you know, the 
way they do, doing I don™t know, working as -- I 
don™t know, in -- in -- learning how
 to s -- you know, their Englis
h, and taking medical exam -- 
and much more difficult things they -- but my 
fat her never really did, and my mother -- my 
mother worked in the -- no, that came later. 
She worked in people™s apartments, cleaning or 
something, it -- it -- I -- it™s not such a happy ch
ildhood. And she was not happy with my father™s 
being home, so she got up and did some thing, a
nd eventually she worked
 in the garme nt center 
in New York, which she liked. She liked being out on her own, and working.

Q: Did your father ever go back to work, eventually? 
A: Not in the way that I presume 
you mean. Never at a job where he 
had to be there nine to five, 
or answer to some body. He did some thing with -- w
ith fluorescent light bulbs, he sold them to -- 
to businesses or some thing, for their fixtures. It 
was never quite clear to me  what he did. I think 

he ma inly played with his stocks, and -- with his stocks.

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an inte
rview with Anita Sockol. 
If you™d like to continue 
telling me  about your father, and 
his work in the New York area? 
A: I think -- now that, often I th
ink did come  up, t hat he thought that he had enough money, and -
- invested in stocks, that he coul d live on that, indefinitely, for the 
rest of his life. I don™t think he 
-- he counted on -- what did we ha
ve, depression, inflati
on, whatever it was, that it turned out not 
to be so. I thought he -- He thought
 he could live better
, or ma ybe they were just ve-very frugal 
people, but they always lived very simply, I th
ink, sort of below their 
me a n s .  A n d  my  mo t h e r  
was really ne ver -- never really adjust ed to Amer
ica. She always dreamt of her life in Berlin, and 
how it was. She was never really, really happy he
re. Never really perfected her English, neither 
did my father, even though my fa
ther read the paper, and -- w
ith a dictionary next to him, 
looking up every word that he didn
™t know, he did that. But -- But 
n-neither one of them really 
became all that Americanized. They lived up in 
Washington Heights, we lived there all their 
lives, with the other so -- you know, so-called 
refugees. And they enjoyed that life, and 
everybody spoke Germa n, and they had café and kuckin 
in each other™s house, and -- and other -- 
you know, and that was the -- but th
e other people, who ca me  with 
less, most of them lived a 
much better life. They went to Florida, and they
 went here, and did this
 and does that. I always 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
39 
 
 
had the feeling that my parents never really --
 never really became  Americanized, and allowed 
themselves to live a real ly full life. Always like -- it™s something fr om that change of comi ng 
here in the way they did, I think. 

Q: Was it a real change from how you lived in Berlin? 

A: I would say so, yeah. That™s 
i-it seems to me , e ven though I was a little kid, that it wa s a much 

-- I mean, my mother never had a cleaning lady. I 
mean, nor was the apartment all that f -- was 
she that fastidious. Didn™t care about those thi
ngs. No, it was always ve
ry modest, and the way 
we ate, and -- and what she bought, and -- and th
e dinn -- it wa s always sort of cheap, which is 
some thing I had to learn to get over. 

Q: What language did you speak
 at home  with your parents? 
A: I guess Ge rman and English both, sort of mi xe
d together. And then, of course, when I got 

older, o-other than the American friends that 
I had from the different schools, I also had f-
friends, you know, at ca -- from wa - -  one way or 
another, friends who also were emigr-emi gra -- 
immi grants? And I knew that they spoke German, 
and we would -- used to -- we u -- whatever 
came to mi nd first, we™d sort of mi x it up, becau
se we knew that we understood each other. But 
now, I™ve sort of lost it, because I don™t -- 

Q: Do yo -- Do you speak fluent -- fluently still? 

A: I th -- I th -- Yo -- I could say I do, but I 
really don™t, because when I™m -- been, on occasion 
with people who speak perfect German, and -- inte
llectually, there are lots
 of words that I don™t 
know, and I guess never knew, because I left
 too young. Like when 
you read documents, you 
know, that you get, or from the [indecipherable]
 stuff, my pr unci -- pr
onunciation is good, but a 
lot of words that I don™t know, a
nd the sentences are so endless, you know, when you read that 
stuff, I forgot what the beginning was when you get to the end.

Q: Wa s it particularly challengi
ng for you to learn English at that age, when you arrived to the 
United States?  Do you reme mber specialchallenges, and how you went about it? 
A: Another good question. Yeah, I was a little 
older than some, so it -- it was -- it was 
challenging, and I reme mber the penmanship, a
nd the -- the script  wa
s some thing different, 
because -- ne ver thought of that til just now, that 
the script in Germany th
at I learned, which was 
quite di ffi cult, was different than the -- the 
way we  write here. And -- But then they had 
penmanship classes, we all had to take penmans hip. And it -- it took awhile
. I think it -- it -- it 
wasn™t all that easy, and how I l
earned it, I don™t know. But my pare
nts were not for education. It 
was a difficult -- they we re difficult. I wanted 
to learn how to play the piano, for instance, 
desperately. There was a period in my  life, you kn
ow, like a window of time, and finally I me an, 
I nagged so -- so much that my mother did give
 me  piano lessons, but I had to practice, and I 
practiced for awhile in the -- in the piano teach
er™s house, which is ridiculous, I mean, how long 
can you keep that up?  And I didn™t, and then afte
r awhile -- but I loved doing it, and I lu -- but 
then I --  I lost interest because
 they wouldn™t let me . They were
 not, in that respect, not like 
Europeans, who are so much for education -- Je
w -- I mean, European Jews. No, they fought me  
in college, and I just needed to
 learn a trade, something to -- to
 -- that I could make a living, or 
could support myself, if necessary, yeah. 

Q: We re you helped at all by a ref
ugee organization when you arrived? 
A: We must have been. I reme mber the word 
HIAS, in what respect, I don™t know. I know they 
exist today. We must have bee
n, but -- and there was some body w
ho -- that my father knew here, 
some  ma n who was not really a rela -- a f -- a 
relation, I -- but he -- who 
had to vouch for us, but 
didn™t have to put up any money, or however th
at was in those days. You know, you had to be 
sure in those days, that you would not become  
a burden to the U. S. governme nt, and that was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
41 
 
 
never an issue, but we lived very simply, frugal,
 and it was really --  was still the -- toward the 
end of the depressi on. Wasn™t really until World 
Wa r Two that we got out of the depr ession. I 
reme mber penny candy, and eggs were a nickel 
a dozen, and you know, I ga -- I -- we -- we 
ma naged.  

Q: As you were adjusting, do you reme mber notic
ing ma ny cultural differences being in the 
United States, being in th
e schools, meeting friends? 
A: I -- I -- I liked it, I know I liked it. I liked 
going to these other wa 
-- once I got acquainted 
enough with the cl-classma tes to become  friendly 
and be invited to thei
r house, suf -- I liked 
doing that, and it some how -- it was different. I liked
 the Ame r ican way of doing things, it -- it 
seemed mor e  casual, mo re lighthearted, more spur
 of the mo me nt. People seemed generous with 
their milk and cookies, or candy, or whatever. I -- I 
-- It™s just a feeling th
at I ha -- that I have, 
you know, not specifics. And I do reme mber going 
-- [indecipherable] certain people that were 
friends of mine. Carol Shiff, and some body na me
d Edith Pearlmudder, some thing. This is early 
on, you know, it must have been 1938 - ™39 -- 1
940. And some  kids, you know, that -- but it -- it 
-- I began to really like it, that™s what I reme
mber. My parents, I don™t know, but I liked it.  
Q: We re mo st of the students in your school Jewish? 

A: Good question. No, mi xed. No, mi xed. I me an, th
ere were a lot of Jews
 living in Washington 
Heights, but they were mi xed. I think there were a 
lot of Irish and Italian. No Blacks or Hispanic, 

that wasn™t  -- that wa -- they 
-- you know, that was not an -- they 
weren™t there. But I -- I think it 
were -- they weren™t just Jewish. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  having friends who are 
not Jewish then, as you progress through your 
years in school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
42 
 
 
A: Yes, I do. I reme mbe r  some body name d Barb
ara Krunendonk, and her father was a -- was a 
musician, and he played in that orchestra, was 
it Lawrence Welk, or some famous orchestra, that 

was fa mous at the time. I™m not sure it was 
Lawrence We lk. But some body that -- that at the 
time was a very well known orchestra, and we we
re friends, and yeah, there were others. But 
there was a Y, a YMHA, where now is a Port Aut
hority building, right at 
the George Washington  
Bridge, on the New York side of the George Wa
shington Bridge, that became  like  my haunt. 
That™s where we hung out, so to speak, you know. 
Cause after all, I was already almost a 
teenager, you know, after I learned the language, a
nd met a lot of -- so th
a -- there were -- that 
was definitely Jewish.  

Q: Did you ever, yourself think, or did your pa
rents ever think that you would return to 
Germany, or  to Europe? 

A: Hm. I never -- I never thought of it, you know
. My mother, I don™t know. I think she would 
have if she could have, but my father, no, he w
ouldn™t -- wouldn™t hear of it. He was perfectly 
happy here. And -- But she just never -- never 
got -- my mother was like a dreame r, you know, 
and she™d love opera, and she would buy herself 
records, and she loved, you know, travel, and 
she™d see a movie, and I™d say, ﬁWhy don™t you 
go on a trip, instead of seeing a movie?  Why 
don™t you buy yourself a ticket to 
go to the opera, instead of lis
tening to Mario Lanza,ﬂ or 
whatever, on the record. But she didn™t, as we say, 
fagin herself. Not that 
they couldn™t have, but 
that™s how they lived. She was like a [indeciphera
ble] happy with her -- her record, scratchy 
record. You know, and -- and the furniture that sh
e bought early on, I think she had it for the rest 
of her life, that when my mother died, I just 
liquidated that apartment 
with my daughters, in a 
day. I told the day care person, ﬁTake what you wa
nt.ﬂ There was just 
nothing. But she never -- 
never really settled in, or bought 
herself things, or buy herself a fu
r coat, or like her friends did, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
43 
 
 
go a lot to have her nails done, or some thing. Yo
u know, it just wasn™t -- 
not that she was an 
intellectual who -- su -- fo
r some -- she felt like she wasn™t 
worthy, I think, of doing these things 
for herself. Talk about
 it, but didn™t do it.  
Q: Did you feel safe in the United States? 
A: Yes, I think I fe lt safe in the United States. 

Q: And how long do you think it took for you to no l
onger feel so isolated 
after first arriving, and 
perhaps even to feel as 
if you were an American? 
A: I think -- I think it took -- took a few years. 
I think it took until I began to go to junior high 
school. Now, I -- I said they put me  into four A, 
but it didn™t take until the 
end of six B, it wasn™t 
two years, I skipped somewhere. I told you I skip
ped five times, but I don™t know when all those 
five times were. One of them was in high school. 
So I would say it took -- I™d say at least a year 
and a half. 

Q: And whe n did you receive your U.S. citizenship? 
A: Ha -- I have those papers at home. I™m not 
sure, because first -- it -- it was twice. Once I 
became a citizen through my parents, cause I 
was too young to be a citizen on my own, and I 
forgot how ma ny years it took, do you reme mber ? 
Q: I™m not sure, no. 

A: I™m not sure. Wa s it five years, was it seve
n years?  No, probably wa
sn™t. I don™t know how 
old I had to be, did I have to 21, or wa s it 
18? But I had like two certi -- but I do have a 
certificate which I have at home. I don™t -- I don™t
 really reme mber, but I know it was a -- it was 
a thrill. I™m very proud of the certificate, and st ud
ied for the questions, and all that st uff, which 
were not difficult at the time, or maybe not for 
a kid who was learning hist
ory, wasn™t difficult. I 
think they™re much harder now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

Q: So, as far as hearing news from ab
road, from Germany, a nd from elsewhere. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How mu ch do you reme mber hearing during 
those years, especially as you became  a 
teenager, the beginning of course, too, and then as you got older, and became a teenager, perhaps 

more aware of events anywhere, 
but how much did 
you really hear? 
A: I think we  -- like everybody else, we weren™t 
really aware about the 
concentration camps, 
until much later. I don™t really know
 it -- but we did know about, like you said earlier, about the 
aschluss, and then very soon after we came 
here, you know, what happened in Holland, and 
Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and you know, as -- a
nd France, and what was happening, and then 
the concern about my -- the relatives, and wher
e they were. And some how then, my mother did 
find out -- and of course she was in touch with he
r sister in Pa lestine, and she knew -- she found 
out, I as -- surely that she must have been i
nvolve d with those organizations, because how did 
she find out that my Aunt Kate was in Theres
ienstadt, survived Ther
esienstadt, and some how 
came to the United States, and she was just thrilled to have he r sist er he re, because she was very 

close to that sister, as a chil
d. They we re closer in age than
 anybody else, and they were just 
closer. But it wasn™t to be  for very long, because
 she died before I got married, and I got married 
in 1947, my first ma rriage, and she wasn™t ther
e. But I do remember her comi ng, and she was a 
tough bird, and I would -- used to
 be very angry at her, because
 she was another one of those, 
like my father would, in Germany, go back to Ge
rmany, always afraid I™d have too much -- too 

much pleasure, like a birthday party, and go to
 the movies all in one, and no, no, no, no, and she 
was of that same  -- she was tough, she was very 
smart, and was, I think, quite a figure, an 
important person in Theresienstadt
, you know, like a -- a l
eader within the circ
les, whatever they 
did there, and a Bridge player, and so on and so 
forth, and I think she even had a romance there, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
45 
 
 
which I wrote in the -- one of those guest books that
 they have, when I was there last year. It was 
-- I -- I met that man, they both survived, ev
en though she was ma rried to some body t hat -- you 
know, not a happy ma rriage, she ma naged to fall in 
love there, which is sort -- sort of, you know, 
as an adult, life goes on, even those things ha
ppen there. But anyway, when she came, she -- I 
would be angry with her for not -- for being str-
strict, you know, and -- an
d sort of siding with 
my father on issues, whatever they were, things th
at I wanted to do. It was not -- not easy for me  
as a -- the upbringing of my parent
s. I think that was one of the 
reasons I got ma rried very early. 
The other wa s that my mother pushed me  into it.  
Q: How did -- What did you hear specifically of Kristallnacht? 

A: What did I hear? Wel l , we must have hear
d about it, I mean, I -- 
I -- I really -- I don™t 
reme mber d -- I -- I really don™t remember, 
probably you know, I don™t want say some thing 
that™s incorrect, and say, oh we 
heard this and that, only to find 
out -- I mean this is something 
that™s easily checked thr
ough American newspapers. Did we hear
 about it at that time?  Did we?  
Yes, we did?  We ll, if -- if it was so, then we -- 
then we did, and we were very upset. I just don™t 
know whether it was as it happened in the news
papers, or it came  late
r. Well, ma ybe  we did. 
Q: And, did you get the sense -- 

A: Oh, I -- Yeah, you™re right, we did, because of 
my Uncle Martin who did not take my father™s 
-- he did not use those tickets that he sent him 
for Shanghai because he felt like he was going to 

be -- I used to say that, like he was -- sent him 
a ticket to go to the moon. I mean, he wa s a very 
provincial guy who, I don™t know, worked for the 
mu- municipality or had some  kind of civil 
service type job or -- and if he
 lived in some thing that™s comp arable to Brooklyn, and just go to 
Shanghai, when he™s never been out of Berli
n, and you know, in a -- it wa
s just -- he c -- he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
46 
 
 
couldn™t seem -- you know, couldn™t get hims elf to do 
it, and he didn™t have much ti me to just 
get up and leave, and he didn™t, so -- 

Q: Do you reme mber hearing from them -- fr
om him, or your other family me mbers -- 
A: I -- 

Q: -- about Kristallnacht
, or other incidents? 
A: I think that was -- that was soon at -- I -- 
I don™t know. I have no letters or anything among 
my me moirs, you know, and things that my parent
s have, or that they 
saved, that they were 
actual letters.  

Q: Did you have the impression, over
 the years of the -- of the wa
r, that things were getting 
worse for Jews? 

A: Yeah, yeah, definitely. 

Q: And as you were growing -- growing up, and of 
course by the end of the war, I -- I believe 
you™re about 18 years old at -- at that
 stage perhaps. Is that ga -- 
A: We ll, you know wha t  I really reme mb -- as -- as
 a -- I became very Americanized, and I -- as I 
think about the war, I reme mber th -- I think 
about the war from an Amer ican girl™s point of 
view. I went out with -- my friend had a brother 
who was in the army, and he took me this -- my 
first date, my first play. Because he was in the 
army, he got tickets to 
see ﬁOklahoma!ﬂ, which 
was a play, and nobody could get tickets for anyt
hing, except G.I.™s, you know, and I was thrilled 
to go to the theater. But I thought through -- and 
-- and then you -- you got 
some  -- the soldiers 
gave you their -- their -- whatever 
they are, insignias, the bar from
 a lieutenant, or -- and these 
were the -- and working for the -- what was it
, AWVS, something, and do-doing things for the 
war effort. I reme mber, as a kid in the -- as a 
-- in junior high school, doi
ng things after work, 
saving silver foil, the ration stamps. I -- I see it
, myself, as like a little Ame r ican girl, an-and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
47 
 
 
seeing it through the eyes of Ameri
can soldiers, and sailors, and Ma
rines, and Air Force, and the 
songs and the tremendous patriotism that we all 
had. That™s what I think this generation doesn™t 
quite have that, it™s a -- and of
 course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I mean, he was like a god to 
me at the time. Didn™t want to read the things
 that I read, you know, on Ellis Island and -- and 
not knowing about the -- the SS Saint Louis. Didn™
t even know there was a German ship til I 
read your things from the Holocaust Mu -- 
cause Saint Louis, you know, you think it™s an 
American ship.  
Q: When did you -- Wh en did you learn of concen
tration camps, and the ma ss murder of Jews? 
A: I don™t know when I learned it. I don™t know. Ag
ain I have to -- I mean, I know that my aunt 

is like, you know, by that time  I knew, because she 
came here, but I -- I -- I guess I knew it when 
everybody else knew it, whenever that
 was. I -- Certainly my parent
s were very interested to s -- 
an-and worried about their relativ
es not knowing what happened to my -- her brother, and th -- 

and the -- and the family, and I -- I -- if I™m 
-- I™m going to look it up when we conclude this 
interview, but -- so they -- whatever wa-was ne
ws on the radio, and in the paper, they kept up 
with, but when exactly -- I mean, I guess I 
learned it as everyb
ody else learned it. 
Q: Did you meet ma ny Holocaust survivors 
then, comi ng to America after the war? 
A: Yes, yes I did. People came, I did meet people. I me t -- me et people who were eventually 

friends, you know, through, because I have these -- s-
some American friends, others that weren™ t 
American, and I met people who had been in 
Auschwitz, I -- I was fr iends with Holocaust 
survivors who had been in c
oncentration camps, cause I reme
mber their tattoos, you know, on 
their arm. But I me -- I had a lot of fr -- I had a 
lot of friends who were 
from -- early on in my 
first ma rriage, me t a lot of people who were -- th
ey were really mi xed friends, friends who were 
born in Germany, and others who were American.

Q: Did you ever experience anti-Semitism in America? 
A: I reme mb  -- Yes, I think I did. I -- When I finish
ed junior high school -- wa
s just telling this to 
a friend of mi ne the other day, cause my father was 
such a di sciplinar ian, that he insisted that I 
go to -- everybody was leaving for George Wa sh
ington High School from this -- almo st 
everybody, all my Jewish friends, yes, they were 
mostly Jewish. Some how you just -- naturally 

you gravitate to them, you know?  He insisted th
at I go to Washington 
Irving High School, which 
is a sort of high school that -- with an emphasis 
on needle trades, because he -- be ing that™s the 
business he was in, he wanted me  to become  a 
designer, or learn how to sew. He pushed it so 
that to this day I hate sewing. And then, at any 
rate, I -- under duress, I went to George Wa shing 
-- to Wa shington Irving High School. Had to take the train downtown, all my friends went to the 

other school. And one of the -- on the first days
 in the school, I saw 
that everybody was Italian, 
and I sort of felt I had to -- sort of -- I felt out 
of place, and one girl said to me , she says, ﬁYou 
want to hear a joke? ﬂ  Said, ﬁSure.ﬂ And she sa
id, ﬁWhat™s the fastest 
thing on two legs?ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁI don™t know, what? ﬂ  And she said, ﬁA Je
w passing a draft board.ﬂ When I heard that, I 
really put my foot down, I went home to my father
, I didn™t want to be th
ere in the first place. I 
said, ﬁI am not staying in that school, I am not
 going to stay there.ﬂ And I insisted on being 
transferred to George Washington Hi gh School, wh
ich they did do, and then I was much happier, 

and I was a very -- was a good student, I was an arri
ster, and I sort of found myself. Actually in 
junior high school, I -- I did well,
 but then I, you know, found myse
lf in my teenage years, but 
they were turbulent, I was never -- I had a lot, 
I think, to contend with as
 a teenager, more than, 
you know, had I been born here with pa
rents who were, but that™s obvious. 
Q: When did you and your parents get contact
ed by the German governme nt as part of 
reconciliation efforts? I believe
 that™s called vidogutmachen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
49 
 
 
A: I cannot reme mber when that was, but I know
 f -- I know it was uf -- early on, when they 
began to do that, it wasn™t real
ly I think the German government so much, as the Berlin 
governme nt, because they were getting these checks, you know, so -- from the German 
governme nt, for lost property, or 
-- my mother got something that 
was sort of like the equivalent 
of -- loosely speaking, like Social Securit
y, because she could prove her -- she had her 
employme nt  records or some thing, and taxes th
at were taken out, sounds strange, but it was 
based on that. And she di -- 

Q: You me a n she had worked in Germany?  

A: Yes, she did -- 

Q: And then -- 

A: -- as a -- as a  young woma n. Re me mber, she 
was 27 when she got ma rried, and she worked, 

as a ma tter of fact, for my uncle. She worked in 
-- he ma nufa c tured hats in Ke mnets, and when 
she lived it -- she worked there and some wher
e else. Not a profession, but some thing, you know, 
sales. And so there was a connection between 
her and -- and the government, and they were 

contact -- I know they didn™t cont
act -- my parents didn™t cont act them, because when they got 
this information -- also, it was around Wa shi
ngton Heights, everybody was -- knew about it, or 
people here and there were getti
ng these invitatio
ns. But they did not want to go. And then we 
just sort of let that -- and I said, ﬁWhy don™t you,ﬂ you know, ﬁwhy 
don™t you go? ﬂ ﬁNo, no, no,ﬂ 
my father said, ﬁDon™t wa nt to ever go back to
 Germany, no, not interested.ﬂ So we just dropped 
it. And then there were years in between, I pres
ume it was like in the early 70™s or something? 
Q: How did your mo m feel?  She had shown so much
 interest in -- in pe
rhaps in staying in 
Germany at the time. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
50 
 
 
A: She -- I -- I don™t know. I guess 
she just -- he absolutely didn™t 
want to, and they never really 
went anywhere, or did anything. You know, going toFlorida for a couple of weeks was -- that he 
wanted to do, and she hated it, because they
 did it year after y
ear after year, again 
[indecipherable]. But if she did want to go, it 
was sort of crushed, you know, that desire.  

Q: How did you become  more involve d in either receivi ng things from Ge rmany -- 

A: Let me  just add, yes, she did really want 
to go places, because she finally went to -- to 
Europe, I forgot about that, my mo
ther, by herself. She went to Israel to visit her sister, she said 
she wanted to go. Her sister Anna. Kate had di ed
 in 1946, I guess, because I got ma rried in ™47, 
and she was no longer alive, died of cancer here, 
recurrence. But, she went by herself, my father 
did not want to go anywhere, and she picked he
rself up, she went to Rome  by herself, and she 
went to Israel by herself, and that
 was pretty cons -- for her, quite 
a feat, and she loved it, but that 
was, you know, the biggest trip. And she always used
 to talk about when her sister Anna, and her 
brother-in-law, who lived very well, very comfor
tably, took her and her mother, Frieda to Nice 
on the Riviera. Must have been in the early 
30™s or some thing. No, I don™t know when it was. 
Was it after she was ma r r ied?  I don™t know, but how
 she loved that trip, 
and how glamorous and 
how wonderful it was, you know. So, she mi ght -- 
she mi ght have wanted to go, but never did. 
Q: Tell me about some of the items that you star
ted to receive. I believe it™s books, I don™t know 
if there are other items from Berlin, from 
-- and who did you receive them from, actually? 
A: From Berlin, yes I started to receive a lot of
 things. Some  things were annual, some  things 
were quarterly. Annual were calendars, very beautif
ul calendars, I -- I thi
nk I get those to this 
day, they™re still doing that. But they sent 
books, you know, Berlin 1979 - 
™70 - ™80 - ™81, every 

year, and always relating to Jews, they were like
 soft cover books, very interesting, in German, 
with pictures, and I™d get some thing about a fa
mous cartoonist, who had -- her na me  was Zille, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

Z-i-l-l-e, and -- who died at -- 
in the late 1920™s, and was very fa mous and it was very funny, to -

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an
 interview with Anita Sockol. Would you like to 
continue talking about the items  that you 
received from Berlin, through the years? 
A: And a mong these books, you know, that had -- 
we receive every year, they we -- in 1988, I 
believe it was, I got a book about the Jews 
of Berlin, and it we nt back from the 19
th
 century, into 
the 20
th
 century, up until 1939 or ™40, whenever, 
you know, some thing like that. And I leaf 
through this book, and I couldn™t be
lieve it, there was a picture 
of me  and my cla -- in my 
classroom, with me in it, my -- 
all the -- all my classmates fr
om, I think, 1935. And when I saw 
that, I said, I™ve got to -- I sa
id, ﬁHow did they got ahold of
 this picture? ﬂ Well, obviously, 
some body else had the same  class picture, I found
 that out subsequently, some body who lived in 
England, and submitted it to them. At any rate, I -- 
I -- it -- it piqued my interest , and I now -- I 
thought I wanted to go to Berlin, 
and get this trip that my pare
nts never took advantage of. So I 
got in touch, it™s a le
ngthy involveme nt, I won™t go into 
it. And we had a lot of corens -- 
correspondence back and forth. I told him about the 
picture, they were very interested in the 
picture, and I traced it, and said
 I could identify the g-- most of the girls to this day, which I did 
do, and then they published it in 
yet another publication that they
 had, a g -- like a newsletter, 
that went to all former Berliners, and I star ted 
receiving ma il from all these people because they -
- I -- it said some thing about Anita Sockol in Ne
w York, blah, blah, blah, and I started receiving 

them. And because of this -- so 
I had two things going on at the 
same time, it was very exciting 
really, receiving these le
tters, and also questions. Did I know some body name d Ilsa Plachte, and 
-- because that was a very good friend of mi ne, 
and where does she live?  And I would call that 
person back, they lived in Columbus, Ohio. I sa
id, ﬁThat was my cousi
n, I heard that, you know, 
she died in Auschwitz.ﬂ Other people wrote to me
, they were -- th -- this woman just knew the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
53 
 
 
name , and a s  I was busy writing and corresponding w
ith these other people, I was also talking to 
this woma n in Berlin, and sort 
of pushing it to get the trip. She 
said I was too young, if I wanted 
to come with my mother. And I sa
id, ﬁAt this point, my mother 
couldn™t possibly travel.ﬂ And -- 
But because of it, I think they 
gave it to me . And I  did go on the trip to Berlin, in 1989, in the 
spring. March, I believe it was, before the wall 
came  down. And it was a very interesting trip, 
with ma ny -- with wonderful things that they 
did for us, and yet you had such -- such strange 
feelings, everybody did, you know. And I have a cous
in who lives -- second 
cousin who lived in 
Berlin at the time, and the free time that we 
had, he showed me  the railroad tracks, you know, 
over a bridge, that™s where the Jews were shippe
d to Auschwitz from, and a little doorway that 
looked like a closet, you know, you™
d walk right by. And he said, ﬁI
n there is an Orthodox shul,ﬂ 
which you™d -- you™d never think there was anything 
in there. And told me  -- So, I had very 
mi xed feelings. At night I couldn™t sleep from all 
the things that were -- that my -- my feelings 
were, you know, accosted with. And we me t the ma yor 
of Berlin, hetalked 
to us, and there were 
cocktail parties. We met 
a senator, a woman senator, and they
 made these speeches, dear former 
citizens, and it was very strange. Very difficult to
 explain the -- can™t sa
y love, but the -- some  
kind -- some  kind of me mories, and yet the -- the 
anti-Germa n feeling that
 you -- that sort of 
rides over everything. It -- It was very strange, 
and we went to see -- everybody ran to s -- to 
wherever they lived. And there was a ma n who wa
s [indecipherable] from 
this area, I think he 
was from M a ryland, and he lived near where I live
d, and we went to -- by train through eastern 
Berlin, to where I lived, and the 
address existed, but not the buildi
ng, so they must have kept the 
address, but -- you know, but it was some  mode
rn, ugly building, cause 
of -- obviously that 
whole area was bombed out, and like rebuilt. 
Q: What is the address? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
54 
 
 
A: Tw -- Bamburger Street, 26, number 26, in Vilmas
dorf, is the section, cause Berlin is very 
big, very big. 
Q: How wer e  your interactions with other Ge
rmans, non-Jewish Germans living in Berlin? 
A: We ll, they were, of course, all hand picked 
people for this thing. They were younger, and very 
sensitive to the issues, you know
, but I -- I realized that. And 
one -- I had a very interesting 
conversation on one of the days with one of the 
tour guides, when we went to the -- not the 
Reichstag, but the -- that stadium, the Olympic 
stadium where Hitler spoke and he showed us, 
you know, and I -- then I reme mbered it from, I guess 
newsreels. I forgot to me ntion newsreels, 

was i -- cause there was no TV, but how did I hear th
e voice?  Of course, it 
wasn™t just  the radi o, 
newsreels in the movies. And he said that h-he
 -- some thing I never thought of, he said, ﬁOh 
yes,ﬂ he said, ﬁit still 
exists very much.ﬂ He said every S
unday when he goes to his grandparents 
house for Sunday dinner with his -- he -- they
 talk about the old -- good old days, you know, 
they™re died in the wool -- I don™
t know if they™re still 
Nazis, but they long for those Hitler days, 
and they talk about it. And he said there was a 
lot of neo-Nazi stuff going on that he knew of, 
and he felt -- he and his fiancée, that if it gotany worse -- this was in 1989, that he was going to 

move to Canada, he just didn™t like what was goi
ng on. It was interesting to hear it from a young 
German fellow. And I really didn™t think about 
that two generations back, that the young ones 
are exposed to all that, and they
™re still alive and -- and not asha
me d, or anything. They are what 
they are. 

Q: Did you feel unsafe, yourself?   

A: No. No, I didn™t. I didn™t. It 
was so stra -- you know, I -- I felt sort
 of pleased with myself that 
I could speak German in Germany, you know, it ma de it easy to get around, and it gave you like 

a -- it™s very strange feeling, it™s hard to put 
into words. That this was once your home , and yet 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
55 
 
 
it™s not recognizable, it™s 
-- I -- I -- I can™t put it into words, 
the -- the feeling. Like a real love-
hate relationship. 
Q: Did you feel any anti-Se mitism while you were there? 

A: No, but I™m sure I could have. I was in a cont
rol group, really -- controll
ed group. We  went -- 
They -- We  saw what they wanted us to see, 
you know?  Took lovely boat ride on the river, and 
oh, the whole thing was conducted in German, 
t hough, and had wonderful -- we went to the 
theater, everything was brand new, the acoustics, 
the sou -- everything wa
s better than -- I -- I 
never ex -- I never expected to have such a 
trip, you know, I thought it 
was -- I didn™t know what 
to expect. Didn™t know everything would be so 
deluxe. The hotel, the -- even, you go -- show 
your passport at a certain bank, and they gave yo
u money, spending money. It™s all part of it, I 
mean, they do a very, very good job, so that 
you go home  and say it was wonderful, which I 
can™t really say it wasn™t. 

Q: How did you feel about divided Berlin at th at time , and -- you were both in east and west? 
A: Yeah. They -- A tremendous difference, treme
ndous difference, it -- it was like night and day. 
East Berlin was very d -- you know, just like you
 would expect a Communi
st place to look like, 
very old and stodgy and -- and neglected, and even the food. We had coffee and cake or 
some thing there in the afternoon, was awful. And 
when you went -- when we came back to East 
Berlin, it was -- dusk was falling, 
and you see the neon, and the light
s, and the -- and the music, 
it was like night and day, was really 
amazing dichotomy between the two places. 
Q: You me a n when you came back to
 We st Berlin, in the evening? 
A: Yes, when I came back to West Berlin in th
e evening, jus -- as you cr
oss the borde
r, it™s like 
you™re in a different world. It was very interesting.
 But as far as what I felt was concerned, I have 
no -- I -- you know, I had no fear for anybody who 
seemed -- they seeme d poor, and a lot of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
56 
 
 
people seemed unemployed or whatever, but I didn™
t -- I certainly didn™t have any great feeling 
for them, nor the other way -- and -- and still don
™t. And if it costs Germany a fortune to com -- 
you know, to integrate it, I couldn™t care less. They took it on.  
Q: How about me morials regarding the 
Holocaust?  What me morials did you see? 
A: Oh, some thing else that just came to mi nd. I 
was in Germany in 1949, not in Berlin, but when 
I went back to Europe for the first time w
ith my husband, my  first husband, we went to 
Frankfort. He wa-was on business, and first time  I ever went back to Europe, and we™re in 

Frankfort, and the city was absolutely decima te
d. You could see for miles and miles and miles, it 

was just rubble. And way in the distance you saw 
the fa mous Kerner Dome , which is a cathedral. 

And they did this precision bombing, and I reme mb
er seeing all these Germans, this is ™49 now, 
rolling around on ma keshift -- lik
e torsos rolling around, 
lots of them, on a 
wooden crate, with 
like the wheels of a -- of a -- from roller skates
, you know, one on each corner, so that they could 
-- you know, their legs blown off, and -- and I reme
mber -- and they wer -- 
the food was terri -- 
no, the food was good, it was bad in England, and in
 -- in London, and in Pa
ris, you couldn™t, but 
in Germany, through the PX™s, you could get almost
 anything, and it just bothered me , and I -- it 
just -- seeing these people ro
lling around, I just couldn™t have cared
 less, is -- it™s -- you know, I 
had no symp athy whatsoever on how difficult the war was for them. It was very strange being 

there, I had forgotten that I was in Germany. 

Q: How do you feel about Germ
ans, and Germa ny today? 
A: To be honest with you, almost the same . I a m 
sure that I will die with
 that feeling. Don™t 
know quite why I feel that 
way, being that I -- you know, 
didn™t have to go through a 
concentration camp, but I™m very -- just so gratef
ul, you know, that -- and feel
 so fortunate that I 
-- like, I mi ssed it by a hair, and I just feel a 
--  a tremendous -- a tremendous feeling of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
57 
 
 
some thing to all the people that died there. I -- 
I just -- To me , that™s sort of like my r e ligion. I 
just feel compelled to read, 
you know, almost anything on that, or see every film, or every 
documentary. I just feel very drawn to it, and 
I™m always very annoyed 
with people -- most of 

them are Jewish, who say -- and there are many, I -- 
I can™t deal with that, 
I -- I can™t watch it, I 
can™t look at it, I can™t read it, 
and I always feel like, I said, 
ﬁYou can™t look at it? ﬂ I said, ﬁYou 
di -- it -- it™s like you -- you ought
 -- you know, you didn™t have to go through it, why can™t you 
look at it?  I feel like that™s your
 duty to look at it.ﬂ Or, I couldn
™t go to a Holocaust Museum, and 
it -- I find that very annoying, 
and many people say that to me. 

Q: What are your impressions of how Germans are 
dealing with, or not dealing with the history 
of the Holocaust? 

A: We ll, I™m certainly no expert
 on it. I -- I see 
-- you know, I read these -- the answer -- you 
know, that Daniel Goldhagen™s book is such a h
it in -- in Germany, and that they like klesma  
music, which is sort of weird to me , like it -- 
I™m sure there are some  
-- I -- I really
 don™t know, 
ma ybe it is a generational thing, but I -- I thi
nk that ma ny Germans -- and I™ve learned that 
they™re -- heard this from r
eally very well known, and very know
ledgeable professors, I take 
courses in international politics in New York. Th
ey -- They don™t really 
know what to do with 
democracy. It™s sort of inbred. I™m not gene
ralizing, but they feel 
comfortable under -- you 
know, being told what to do, and as long as it™s  orderly, and clean, and neat, and no crime, you 

know, at least, you know, the ordinary kind of cr
ime, that they feel comf ortable with that. 
Q: What are your impressions of the me morials 
that you saw in Germany?  And I think you were 
in Germany in recent years tw
ice, in 1989, as well as 1998? 
A: Correct. 

Q: Correct? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
58 
 
 
A: I was, yeah. ™89 was that trip, and 19 -- Oct
ober 1998 was a -- a couple of days in Berlin, a 
trip of eastern Europe. I was in Budapest, Prague
 -- Budapest, Prague, where else was I?  Vienna. 
Vienna and Berlin. And I have th
at same  feeling, by the way, for the Viennese. I mean, Austria 
and Germany, as far as I™m concerned, I lump th
em together. If anythi
ng, I dislike them more, 
because they™re so -- you know, so like our sout
hern people or some thing, you know, with that 
smaltzy Viennese, but that™s just
 me . What was your question, how? 
Q: About the me morials that you™ve seen. 
A: Oh, the me morials. I th -- I -- I -- I didn™t 
see anybody looking at them, or noticing them. I™ve 
seen some , they™re -- they™re very
 subtle, you don™t even know what
 they are. And I™ve seen chil 
-- they™re like in a 
children™s playground, and kids climb on them, or play around them. They™re 
not revered. They™re just up here 
and there, again, only the ones 
I™ve seen, maybe there are some, 
but -- but there was one ri-right
 on the Krufensadum, and very -- right by the ma in -- the ma in 
subway station, right near the Kaufasdesvestens, 
this famous departme nt store. And it™s -- that 
one referred to different -- it 
just me ntioned different concentr
ation camps, like on a -- on a post, 
but it™s -- it™s well done, and I think that peopl
e just go about their business, nobody looks at it. 
And that™s a spot sort of like Time s Square. What 
they do look at, and it is interesting, is that 
church. You must have seen that church, we bombe
d out that fa mous cathedr
al, and they left that 
standing there in the mi ddle of moder n Berlin, 
which is quite interes
ting, but that™s just a 
remi nder of the war, not -- nothing to do with 
Germans -- nothing to do with Jews. It™s very 

dramatic. 

Q: Did you notice ma ny differences after the wall
 had come  down, on your second trip to Berlin, 
in 1998?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
59 
 
 
A: Yes, I did, I did. I -- They ar
e building there like 
crazy. I™ve never seen 
anything like it. And 
our tour guide, who was excellent, a guy from M
unich, told us, among ma ny other things, that 90 
percent of building cranes in Ge
rmany were all in Berlin, and th
is really wasn™t a good time to 
visit Berlin, if you wait a year or 
so, it™ll be like a whole new cit
y. It was just amazing. All the -- 
you know, the Fortune 500 compani e s, or whatever, 
of the world, were building there, and they 
weren™t just building buildings, they were build
ing like whole plazas, and 
it™s ju -- tremendous, 
un-unbelievable the building going on, which was-- there was nothing going on in -- in 1989.  
Q: Did you have much c o mmunication with Jews liv
ing in Be rlin today, or in the mo dern day? 
A: No, none. We  were at a very nice hotel, a
nd then we went and di
d things, you know, on our 
own, really. And of course, a famous  muse -- 
you know, went to a museum, the thing that 
tourists do, including the zoo, whic
h is spectacular, a
nd the -- you went to that museum, I know 
you did, the Pergamon Museum. And -- And went to 
-- to try that Berlin
er food, which -- which 
was very interesting. 
Q: Was the Jewish muse um constructed when 
you were there in 1998?  Did you visit the -- the 
new Jewish museum in Berlin? 
A: I did not go, no, I didn™t. I don™t -- no, I did not.  

Q: How would you say -- Oh, one more question 
about visiting Germany, have you -- did you 
have a chance, in Germany, or elsewhere in 
Europe to visit con
centration camp sites? 
A: Yes, for the first time. I know that -- that -- 
that other time I was -- yeah I™m -- as I realize it 

now, I was also in Munich once, forgot about that. 
But I did not go to -- to Dachau. I was near it, 
but I didn™t go. That was year
s ago with -- I don™t know. But 
this time, in 1998, I did visit 
Theresienstadt, because  it was part of the tour . We were on our way from Prague to Vi enna, I 

believe. It™s that right? Think s
o. Wh atever, and via Dresden, a
nd we -- we went to -- yeah, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
60 
 
 
because Theresienstadt , I think, was near, or in Czechoslovakia, and it was quite an experience. I 
-- And I knew that that was not the worst ones. I 
reme mber hearing that from my aunt, and she 
did survive, and -- and they ha
d, you know, some  kind -- some  sort of a life there, but I don™t 
think I could bear visiting Auschwitz
. I don™t ever want to go to Poland. 
Q: What would you say, if you can identify this, is 
the long term i mpact that your experiences, of 
having to flee Germany, and be a refugee, and 
then, in general, the Holocaust has had on your 
life. 

A: It™s a hard question to answer, but I am su
re that it has had a profound affect on me. You 
know, you think it hasn™t, but it has.
 It has -- I probably would have 
be -- been a different person. 
I mean, it™s hard to speculate, but I mean, I™ m 
happy that -- that I came to America, but comi ng 
as a refugee, I think if I -- if
 I had been born here, I would be 
a different person today. Maybe not 
everything for the better, but I thi
nk most of if, yes, s -- educa -- 
and it™s hard -- hard to say. 
Q: Do you think that the Holocaust has had an 
impact on either your politics or your religious 
faith, or any sort of, career decisions? 
A: I think on my career decisi ons, because my 
parents -- well then, of course, that was my 

parents. Had I been -- Had it -- had not happe
ned, I probably would not have gone on to much 
higher education. In Berlin, 
I guess nobody did it, or almost nobody. Here, you have more 
opportunity, and still my par -- it was ma ybe more 
my parents doing than -- and their feeling -- I 
think they always felt like refug
ees, all their lives, and therefor
e, you know, passed that on to me , 
to get ma rried, and you know, get -- I -- I don™t kn
ow why I had to, you know, get ma rried, so I -
- I just had turned 19 -- no, just had turned 20. My
 birthday™s in  Septem
ber, I got married in 
October, but I -- in those days, chronologica
lly, you know, I was just 
20, but otherwise, I, 
emotionally, I was like 16. And I was, you know, so
me thing that really should not have had -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
61 
 
 
should have gone, you know, and furthered, you know, gone
 for more of a career, and so it -- it 
did affect me. But what did you ask me ?  
Q: And also whether you think the Holocaust ha
s had any effect on your 
political interests and 
inclinations, and also 
your religious faith. 
A: I think it -- on my political incl
inations, yes, I think most people ar e pretty democratic, and 
liberal, and I think it has some thing to do with th
at, of course, because you can see yourself in 
that same position, in relation to
 Blacks, or whatever, mi norities. 
As far as religion is concerned, 
well, I wasn™t brought up on a religious home. My
 first husband was very religious. I was not, 
that was a bad combination. And it sort of, if 
anything turned me  against it, I found it very 
cumbersome , and cumbe r ing and -- and I just ha ve a tremendous feeling about the Holocaust, 

and still more as I get older, as 
I said earlier. I still do. I -- I -- 
I have more -- more and more so. 
And that, some how, is like my religion, you know. 
I -- I  don™t really -- 
I™m not a religious -- I 
like tradition, a little bit 
of it, you know, with the fa mily, and we spend the holidays together, but 
it means mo re to my children th
an it does to me , to be honest.  

Q: How do you feel about the ways in which the Ho
locaust has been portrayed, especially in this 
country, in the United States, esp
ecially in popular culture, movies
. Also, even portrayed in this 
museu m. 

A: Oh, I think the museum is fant
astic, I really do. I think it™s
 a fabulous museum, it™s portrayed 
very, very we ll, and all the high tech things, and 
all the little films you ca
n see. I haven™t really 
begin -- begun to scratch the surf
ace, if I really wanted to see 
everythi ng, cause I™m ne ver here 
long enough. If I lived in 
the area, I probably would have done 
it, but I -- it™s not the end, I™m 
going to continue to do it. And in
 films, I ge -- I mean, I think much more -- I think s -- it™s -- 
much more is still being said, and I think as we
 get more sophisticated, and as the generation is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
62 
 
 
ready to die out, that there are 
scholars and people still writing from -- and pursuing it from, then 
-- and researching it from different angles, 
and different points of 
view. Especially, I™m 
interested -- I am interested a lo
t in -- well, like that Daniel  Go
ldhagen book, sort of to prove to 
myself that -- about the basic German, how coul
d this really happen, that it isn™t just the 
hierarchy and everything that we
 know, that it could not rea
lly have happened without the 
cooperation of the ordinary German. 
I feel like it™s in their blood, I really do feel that. There are 
exceptions of course, but -- I mean, how -- all the 
little things that happened day to day, how c -- 
how could anybody take just stones, and smash wi
ndows, and take an old ma n in -- into the 
street, you know on an individual basis, wh
en you look at it that way. Nevermind the 
concentration camps, before th
e concentration camps, people 
that you knew, and were your 
neighbors, and you knew them all your life, and a
ll of a sudden you turned your back on -- what 
does it take in a person to do that?  You know, one to
 one. I -- I have to wonder about that. What 
kind of people are those? And other countries,you know, you take a country like Denmark, was 
it?  And they™re just lik
e good people. They just didn™t, a
nd they wouldn™t. 
You know, it™s -- I 
don™t know what that is, when you lump it together 
as one country. Or the pe
ople of -- I -- I -- 
but I -- and I feel that way, yes, to this day, a
nd I feel that about Polish people, Austrian people, 
the whole Ukraine, all those pe
ople that, you know, when you see 
modern day movie s that were 
ma de in this -- last year or 
this year, and you see these old la
dies, with the babushkas, and a 
couple of teeth, it -- it -- you c
ould transpose them into a mo vie of 1938, and if I understood their 
language, they™re st ill -- they -- they
™re born with that anti-Semitism, that™s -- I feel that, I really 
do. That™s why I never wa nt to go to any of those 
other countries. I only went to Berlin, because 
after all, well, it was offered to me , and it was -- 
there is a fascination, it™s a morbid fa scination 
to see the city. And it™s al
so an interesting city.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457

Q: Would you say that you feel hate toward Germ
ans, Ger many, and perhaps other countries that 
collaborated? 
A: Yeah, I do. Yes, I do. Yeah, I don™t forgive. I 
-- I™m not -- I don™t have -- I™m a very -- like a 
very practical person, and I don™t re
ally have religion to fall back
 on. I™m -- I -- I™m not forgiving 
in that sense, or can turn to God. I -- I just se
e it -- what -- what™s the right word, I™m a very 
literal person. Is that the right word? I don™t know. Yeah, I see it, you know, the way it was, or 

read the way it was, a
nd no, I cannot forgive it. 
Q: Do you have any particular impressions of mo
vies such as ﬁSchindl
er™s List,ﬂ and more 
recently, ﬁLife is Beautifulﬂ? 

A: Oh, don™t get me started. We™ll be -- We™ll -- 
You™ll need another tape
. I hated that movie, 
that shi --  that -- that  ﬁLife is Beautiful.ﬂ ﬁSchindl er™s List ﬂ was an interesting movie, it™s a st ory 

about one person, I mean. But it was well done, I 
like Steven Spielberg, and what he™s doing, 
The Shoah Foundation and all that. But I hated that
 -- that ﬁLife is Beau
tiful,ﬂ and I™ve had 
endless discussions with people about that movie. Y
ou had to ask me that at the end. I just -- I -- 
It™s a fable, and I also take 
a film course, and we discuss it 
in the film course. An-And people 
loved it, and I -- I just -- and when
 that -- that guy climbed over thos
e chairs at the Oscars, I ju -- 
I just -- I -- I said, ﬁLet it end already.ﬂ Bu
t there is no end. Do you know that they™re ma king 

another movie?   Yup. S -- Th -- Oh, no, they™re -- 
they™re -- they™re
 putting it with 
eng -- in the -- 
ma king it in English, without titles. 
I knew I read some thing. And I just 
feel that -- like, it™s like a 
sacred thing, that you can™t write a fa ble about 
-- a movie about a -- an experience like that. And 
I feel that anybody who went throug
h the experience, that it was like an insult to people, that 
nothing in that movie could have
 possibly have happened. That th
ey -- he took the little boy with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
64 
 
 
him into -- I felt such an affront, I -- I don™t know w
hy, but I just hated it. And I hate that little 
guy, and his annoying interviews, so 
don™t ask me  any more on that. 
Q: Did you -- We ll, can I ask you at 
least, did you talk about it -- 
A: Of course you can, of course. I™m just be
ing, you know, cause I™ve discussed it a million 
times. 

Q: Did you talk about the movie with 
several other Holocaust survivors? 
A: Yes, and the ones that I know, 
which are limited, because they were
 in my class, I take a -- a 
film course at the new school in New York, 
and almost everybody there, for some  reason or 

other is -- we ll, they™re retired people, and most
 of them are Jewish, and some  of them are 
survivors. And the survivors felt as I did, but I d
on™t know if they were as veheme nt. I -- I just -- 
I just found that movie very annoying. I just -- 
I didn™t like the humor, a nd I didn™t like any of 
those things, and I don™t agree with people who say 
that well, at least th
en they -- more people 
would be exposed to it, you know, who wouldn™t s
ee it, because they™re exposed to some thing 
that never could have happened, it wa s so much
 more horrible. And how can you ma ke a fable 
about anything, but not --

Q: Tape number three, side B, of in interv
iew with Anita Sockol. 
I™d like to ask you how you 
talked with your children as they grew 
up, about your experiences in Germany, leaving 
Germany, a nd about the Holocaust. 

A: We ll, through the years, I -- I guess the -- 
we talked, you know, it came up naturally, but they 
-- well, one of my daughters is qui
te interested in it, my older da
ughter. She wanted to come  with 
me  today, you know, but that was not appropriate
. But she is interested, she reads books on it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
65 
 
 
She is interested through her 
synagogue, she™s very involved at
 the Wa shington congregation, I 
forget where Hebrew -- Washingt
on Hebrew, yeah. My other daughter
 is not all that interested, 
and also I tried, you know, even though it™s German, but it is a language, when they were young, 
I tried to speak German to them. My mother 
always said it doesn™
t hurt to know another 
language, which we all know. But they really fought
 me  on it, and I just gave up after awhile. 
My grandchildren are sort of in
terested, but I think 
they™re interested b
ecause it™s a school 
project, you know. I™m s uppose -- becau
se they in turn are learni
ng about the Holocaust, or in 
Hebrew school, or they have to do some thing in
 history, and some ti me s they question me  the 
way you™re questioning me  now, 
but not that -- not that clos
ely, especially my youngest one, 
Michael. But how did -- did I speak to them abou
t it? I --  I guess it wa
s ma ybe -- they would -- 
they did become  interested, but I 
think they spoke more to my pare
nts, probably, than to me . And 
they became interested when they were adults, bu
t then they di dn™t really say much. My father 
didn™t want to talk about it, and 
-- how he came here, and this and 
that. I -- I -- We lived in -- in 
Forest Hills, and I™m trying to think back, I -- 
I don™t know how much it re
ally came up, except 
that the fr iends that I had, as I said earlier,
 they were from Ge rmany as we ll, or German 
speaking, at any rate, and they would grow up h
earing mi xed things, but they knew a little, but 
nothing much has really rema ined, they are 
really just very American, Americanized. 
Q: Did you try to talk to your own parents a
bout Germany, a bout the Holocaust very much? 
A: Boy, I have to really think a
bout these things. I -- No, not so mu
ch, jus t  about this, as they call 
it Ausvanderon, you know that leaving, that process of leaving. And the immediate, the relatives 

and what happened to them, and where they are,
 but then, after years, you know, when the war 
was over, and we knew that there wasn™t going 
to be any -- you know, we
ren™t going to hear 
from anyone, except their -- her sister, Kate, and 
the other one, who lives
 in Israel, we -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
66 
 
 
didn™t talk about it ve ry much any more. I -- I 
don™t know how. I guess I so
rt of just accepted it 
or some thing. My father -- I don™t reme mber my
 father talking much 
about his brother, you 
know, as the years went by. He was a very 
self-involved ma n, not really a fa mily ma n. 
Q: Did you feel a close connection to the creation 
of Israel, and thereaft
er feel a connection -- 
strong connection to Israel? 
A: Myself, I was happy, we were proud, you know, 
when watched those proceedings at the UN, 

and -- but as a -- as an American Jew, no I don™t 
have a very strong conn
ection to Israel. I -- I 
never felt that I wanted to move there, or live th
ere. As a matter of fact, when I was there the first 
time, which is -- was in 1963, after a very wonderful
 trip to Europe. Europe was very luxurious 
in 1963, and then hitting Israel, it was big disappo
intment. I was not very happy there. No, I -- 

it™s -- I™m -- I don™t have a -- I™m 
happy that it exists, but I don™t,
 personally no, I don™t have -- 
and I have relatives there, and I 
care about them, and we are in constant touch through the years, 
letters and sometimes phone calls. 
And they just were very hospitable this last month to my 
grandson David, who lives in Bethesda. He was in 
Israel, as was my la -- grandson La wrence. He 
went two years ago, and they were lovely to th
em. And they stayed with
 them when they had 
time to visit people on their team tour, each one. 
And they were saying that I should come , we 
talked on the phone a couple of w
eeks ago, that I should come , they have a new house, I should 
stay with them. And I™ m consider
ing it, ma ybe, to go back to Isr
ael. But otherwise -- it™s -- it™s 
really because of them, a nd to see Isra -- and 
then my other experience was in 1993. I™d had the 
bad luck to go on a poor tour -- poorly organized tour
, it really wasn™t a tour
 at all, and I -- if it 
weren™t for my cousins there, it would have been
 a pretty disastrous tr
ip, cause I was really on 
my own. It was sold as a tour, but it was -- when
 you got there, it was really like a day tour. I 
could have booked that myself, to see, always 
with different people, 
and different places, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0457  
67 
 
 
know, and put -- it was like a day tour in Tel Avi
v, or Jerusalem. And at the end of the day you 
were plunked down at your hotel, and you had nobody. Bu
t as I said, I had my fa mily there and 
they really saved the trip for me
. So I don™t have such a gra -- it 
wasn™t -- I -- I -- 
I think I™d want 
to try Israel again, and I mi ght consid
er going there in the near future.  
Q: Well, I think I™m just about done. Is there an
ything else you would like to say or me ntion in 
closing our interview today? 
A: No, I -- It was a very enjoya
ble experience to c -- trip down 
me mory lane, which is kind of 
big hyphens there, spaces mi ssing, but it was very in
teresting, and I™m glad to have done it, and 
if it™s -- if it is of any 
value to future researchers, or whatev
er you do with it, then I™m very glad 
to have done my s mall share. Thank you very muc h.
