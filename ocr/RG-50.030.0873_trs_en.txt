Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holocaust
 
Memorial
 
Museum
 interview with 
Mr. 
Ralph Hockley
 on January 12, 2016, in 
Carrollton
, 
Texas
. Thank you very 
much
 Mr.
 Hockley
, for agreeing to speak with us toda y. We™re going to conduct a 
long interview, trying t o capture as many of your experiences as we can, in different 
places, and a Œ in different ti mes. And we™ll start at the very beginning. We™ll ask the 
most basic questions, and from there we develop our story. So t he very fi rst question 
I have for you, can you tell me your date of birth? 

Answer: October 17, 1925. 

Q: And what was your name at birth? 

A: 
Rudo l f
 with an 
F
, 
Martin Hockenheimer
. 
Q: 
Ho ckenhei mer
. And where were you born? 
A: In 
Karl sruhe
,
 
Germany
. 
Q: Can you tell me ge Œ a little bit , just geographically, approximately where is 

Karlsruhe 
in 
Germany
? What are other major places near it?  

A: It™s Œ it™s southwest 
Germany
, it™s a cr Œ just across the river from 
France
. It™s 
where the line separates 
Germany
 and 
France
, and then the border t urns west Œ the 
German border turns west. It™s 45 minutes north of 
Strasbourg
, 
France
, and it™s due 
west of 
Stuttgart
, and duesouth of 
Heidelberg
 and 
Ma nnhei m
.  
Q: Oka y. So could you call it a border town, a border city?

A: You could, but it was more involved in the traffic of boats on the 
Rhine
 river. 
Q: Ah, oka y, oka y. 
A: It™s actually called Œ it used to be, I suspect it still is, 
Karlsruhe am Rhine
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: It™s Œ it™s right Œ it has a big harbor for 
[indecipherabl e]
 shipping. 
Q: Oka y. And how is it  that you happen to be born in 
Karlsruhe
? 
 
A: My Œ 

Q: I Œ were your fam Œ the Œ  
A: My parents Œ 
m y parents 
Œ 
m y mother was from 
Munich
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: And m y father was originally from 
Hockenheim
 Œ  
Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ which is Œ was a cigar town. And then, that is close to 
Ma nnh
eim
, so he grew 
up in 
Ma nnheim
. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And for professional reasons, he came t o 
K arlsruhe
 and joined hi s brother-in-

law in a business i n 
[speaks German]
 
Q: Oka y, what is that? 

A: That is the y Œ t he y sold machines for butchers. The y sold everyt hing the butchers 
needed, including sausage casings, because in those days, all sausages were still 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

made with casings. And so that was a big busi ness, and t he Œ his Œ hi s store was right 
across the street from t he slaughterhouse. 

Q: So your father™s store Œ your Œ your father™s store was across the st reet from Œ 
that™s pretty convenient . 

A: Yeah. 
Q: You know. Oka y, I mean, when I asked that question, yes, it was sort of a 
backwards question to ask, is your family from
 Karlsruhe
. And Œ  
A: The answer is no. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The answer is, m y mother™s family is from 
Munich
, but t hat™s got a lot of ifs to 
it, too. My father™s famil y is definitely from 
B a den
, from the 
Ho ckenhei m
,
 
Ma nnheim
, 
Hei delberg
 
area. Ma 
Œ the reason I say with m y mother is, because the 
Œ her mother was 
from 
Ma nnheim
, and she married a gentl eman who came from a 
place called 
Buttenhausen
. 
Q: 
Buttenhausen
?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Never heard of it. 

A: Nobody else has eit her. It™s a Œ it™s kind of between 
Stuttgart 
and 
Nuremberg
.  
Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

A: There™s a whole big area in there, but that Œ that™s where her father came from. 
And the thing that™s very confusing, if you look at the Œ the family tree, or anythi ng 

else, is that my grandmother, whose maiden name Œ 
well, m y mother™s maidenname 

was 
Lowenthal
(ph) Œ 
Löwenthal
. 
Q: Mm-hm, 
Lö
wentha l
. 
A: And her mother Œ her father was 
Hermann
(ph) 
Löwenthal
,and her mother was 
also a 
Löwenthal
, but they were not related. And so that gets very confusing Œ 
Q: Yes. 

A: Œ when you look at t he Œ at the family trees, because you don™t know which ler Œ 

Löwenthal
 you™re talki ng about. But the y had nothing in common. 

Q: Did you do that? Did you research your family tree, at some point? 

A: Yeah. Yes. 
Q: And ki Œ how fa Œ 
ka 
Œ what can you tel l us about that, what you discovered? 
How far back did your family go in Œ in 
Germany
? How Œ how far back could you 
discover?  

A: Well, m y father™s family, the 
Hockenhei mers
, I™ve been worki ng on all week, to 
make it int o some form that I can give you a copy. My father™s famil y I traced back 

to about 1789, and my mother™s family, I would say the 1850s. 

Q: Oka y. So that™s how far back you were able to find, and the y were all still in t hese 
areas for several generations. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

A: Yeah, what happened, the one thing that you notice when you do t hat, is that in 
the 19 Œ I™m sorry, in the 1890s, t he Jewish people moved from t he villages into the 

cities. So t hat was a big change there. The y all were born i n small towns, but the y all 

wound up in big cities. And that had to do with the government at titude, and so on. 

The y Œ there are a lot  of little things you find out, you Œ for example, until the 1850 
Œ 60s, children had Jewish first names. St arting about ™70 Œ 1870, they al l had very 
German names. 

Q: Really? 

A: My father™s brothers were 
Albert
,
 Louie
. The youngestone was 
Fritz
, 
heaven 

forbid, and my father was 
Julius
 Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ and they all had the German names. The German Jews, it™s a big thing that 
comes out of this, want ed to be Germans. A lot of them were very reli gious, some of 
them weren™t, but t he y all wanted to be accepted, which was a Œ the key to this 

whole thing. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The y wanted Œ t he y finally wanted to be accepted. 

Q: And so, were you able to find Œ 
if you 
Œ there was 
Fritz
 and 
Ira
 and 
Julius
, what 
about their father, what  was his name? Did you remember? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: Well, yes. My father™s father™s name Œ he was born in 1844 i-in
 
Ho ckenhei m
, his 
name was 
Maier
, 
m- a- i-e-r
. There are two versions. It could be 
m-e- y -e-r
, but he-he 
was 
m-a-i-e- r
, and his father was 
Isaac
, with t wo 
As
. 
Q: Well, you know that™s very Œ that™s interesting, because in eastern 
Euro pe
, i n 
Poland
, you would stil l find people of your father™s generation wi th Jewish names, 
rather than let™s sa y, wi th a Polish version, or i n 
Hungary
, a Hungari an version. 
The y woul d still be those old names, which sol Œ which kind of suggests the 
assimilation hadn™t  happened. 

A: Yeah, it wi Œ yeah, the Œ unfortunately, I have to say that the German Jews felt 

very uppity about east European Jews, and the Œ and I don™t Œ the older I get, the less 

I understand it, because I find out in looki ng at the family tree, that, for example Œ 

well, that f Œ the one thing that complicates everyt hing is that because of all the wars 
over there, t he Œ the y Œ  the people changed cit izenship any time. I mean, the y didn™t 
know who was running what part of the 
[indeciphera ble]
. 
On m y 
Œ on m y wife™s Œ 
m y late wife™s family, her name was 
Frankel
, and her paternal famil y, ther Œ her 

fat
her was born in a place called 
Droho bych
, i n Œ in Œ  
Q: Oh yes, in 
Poland
, i sn™t it? 

A: Well, depends when you™re talki ng about it. 

Q: That™s true, that™s true. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: When he was born, it was 
Poland
. In, I thi nk from 1871, after the Franco-
Prussian war, it became part of the Œ of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. Because not 

her father, but her uncles all served in the Austrian army i n World War I. And then, 

after World War I, it became Œ let™s see, after World War I, I guess it  was Polish, and 

after World War II, I t hink now it™s Ukrai nian. So, I can show you a document that I 
have, and they Œ the Œ t he brothers of Œ 
Q: 
Mm
-hm, of your late wife. 
A: Of her father. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The fa Œ his generat ion, born 1885, he Œ her father was. 

Q: Right. 

A: His brothers, who were Œ their oldest one was born in Œ in ™73, 1873, the y all 
served in the Austro-Hungarian army. I have pictures of them in Austrian-Hungarian 
uniform. And one of them, her father, I believe, when he came to 
Germany
, he Œ 
they Œ the y all had a business together in 
Hamburg
, in 
Germany
, and they ha Œ 
Fra nkel
 is a pretty German name. And so he™s Œ his Œ his fr Œ his first name when he 
was born was 
Moses
, and he changed it, in 
Germany
, he changed it t o 
Moritz
(ph). 
So in 
Germany
, he was called 
Moritz
(ph). And in 19 na Œ 1920 Œ and I don™t quite 
understand it, but I™d have to study a lot of history to figure it out , but  in 1920 he Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

he wanted to go from 
Hamburg
 to 
Solingen
, which is in what we now call 
North 
Rhine
-Westphal ia
 Œ 
Q: That™s ri ght. 
A: Œ on a business trip. And he had to go to the Chamber of Commerce, for the 

Chamber of Commerce to support  Œ to support  the request. And so, they supported 
the request. And Œ but on the Œ on the applicat ion, or on this paper, there™s a 
statement, says,what™s yournationality? And 
Œ 1920, and Œ and he answered Polish. 

And Œ and printed on the form it said, and what was it before 1919? Because World 

War I stopped in ™18, what was Œ an Œ 
an
- and then before Œ so, a year before, his 
nationality was Austro-Hungarian. So, you know, just trying to figure out what you 

were, wasn™t exactly easy in those da ys. 

Q: Could be confusing. 
A: It cou
ld bevery confusing.
 
Q: Very confusing. 

A: But the y all Œ 
th ey 
Œ they then, you know, t hey all had then German first names, 

from about that peri od on. 

Q: Now, did you discover these things about your family through your own research, 

or were your parents st orytellers, who tol d you about their lives, thei r childhoods, 

what Œ what Œ who thei r parents were, who their grandparents were? How did you 
discover what you ha Œ what you now know? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

A: Well, I guess there are two answers to t hat, as a child. I lived in 
Germany
 until I 
was eight years old, and as children we Œ we went to see the grandparents on m y 
mother™s side. My father Œ m y father was t he youngest of 10.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: And his parents were long dead. 
Q: I see. 
A: I never knew my pater Œ 
m y 
Œ m y father™s parents, but he had all kinds of an Œ 
brothers and sisters, so we went to visit the aunts and the uncles, and so on. And I 

happened to be very interested in fa Œ I alwa ys knew everybody. To t his day, I can 

tell you what somebody l ooked like. But about their childhood, about  my father™s 

childhood, I know absolutely nothing. I have a sister, 
Diane
, who is a year older than 

I am, and she is a 
PhD
 from 
Berkeley
, and very i nto social work, and I Œ 
occasionally I consult with her, to find out whether she remembers. There are things 

that she remembers differentl y than I do. But I know a lot more about the family 

than Œ than she does. That was not  part of her sphere of interest. On Œ so on my 

father™s side of the family, I knew Œ I knew unc Œ aunts and uncles as a child, just up 

to the ti me I was ei ght or nine. As a Œ on m y mother™s side of the family, I knew the 

family, cause as children, we spent every summer in 
Bavaria
 
wi th my grandparents, 

and particularly wit h my mother™s sisters kids, who were t he same age we were.  
Q: Your Œ you sai d your father came from a family of 10? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
12
 
A: Yeah Œ 
Q: What about Œ 

A: Œ but you know Œ 

Q: Yeah?  

A: Œ it Œ it Œ it was, if you go and l ook at t he family tree, his father was one of who 
knows how many, and Œ and the y all had 10 Œ eight to 10 kids, so that  tryi ng to 
figure this thing out like this, it™s Œ  

Q: You can get a clan i n no ti me. So, stories about your father™s childhood, about his 

growing up, are kind of a blank, even though you did know your aunts and uncles, 

his brothers and sisters. What about  from your mother™s si de? How many siblings 

did she have? 

A: She was one of four. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: She was the second oldest. 

Q: And were the y al l gi rls or boys Œ or were there some boys?  

A: Three girls, one boy. 

Q: Oka y. And let™s Œ let™s go through names. What was your mother™s name? 

A: 
Lilly
(ph). 
Q: 
Lilly
(ph). 
Lilly
(ph) 
Löwenthal
. And her Œ her sisters?  
A: Her oldest sister was 
Elsa
(ph). 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
13
 
Q: 
Elsa
(ph), okay. 
A: Her brother, who was next, was 
Walter
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: And her small sister was 
Margaret
.  
Q: All right. And your grandparent s on her side? 
A: The y™re 
He
rma nn
(ph), and 
Yula
(ph).  
Q: And
 
Yula
(ph), all ri ght. 
A: So the y had Œ and my grandfather was born in 1857, so in Œ i n 1857, his name 
was already 
Hermann
(ph). 
Q: Oka y, so that™s kind of like where the st art Œ the start of this transi tion? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It™s interesting. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: I never knew Œ I mean, I never knew that , that it woul d have been in this ye Œ in 

these years t hat there would be thi s assimilation, this a Œ this attempt at assi milation. 

And, until 
Hitler
, who knew that i t wouldn™t be successful, you know? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Because there was assi milation. 

A: It would have been successful. It was successful. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
14
 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Was your mother™s family Œ how did Œ how did your grandfather 
support your Œ his famil y, on your mother™s si de? 

A: Well, let  me sa y that both of my families were fairl y well-to-do. 

Q: Oka y. That was one of m y questions. 

A: Whateverthat means.
 
Q: Well, it means different things. 
A: My Œ m y maternal grandfather, 
Hermann
(ph) 
Löwenthal
, in those da ys they had 
the habit of marrying younger women, right? 

Q: That habit hasn™t changed, you know. 

A: My Œ m y grandfather was born in 1857, m y grandmother was born in 1876, so 

she was basically 20 years younger than he was. So, when we, as chil dren, got to see 

hi m, that was a big deal. We Œ he was an Œ already an old man. In those days, you 
know, if you figure it out, he was ™57; in 1900, he was 43; and in 1930, he was 73. 
When we knew hi m, he was at least 70 years old. My grandmot her wasn™t, but he 

was. He had a Œ wit h hi s brothers, he had a ladies haberdashery store, a big one, i n 

Munich
, right one block from the 
ba hnho f
. And as kids, we were permit ted to go 
there, there was a bui lding with t wo stories. The hats were made upst airs, not in 

China
. And Œ and we Œ we could watch them make the hats, and t he thing that 
fascinated us is they had a Œ they had a dumbwaiter, or whatever you call the tubes. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
15
 
A: The y had a tube, so all of the Œ the Œ the accounting depart ment was upstairs. 
Q: Oh, so that Œ 

A: 
So  
somebody bought a hat, they pa Œ the y gave the mone y, the y got a bill, and 

gave the money to t he salesperson, and it was put in the tube, and they took care of it 

upstairs. 
Q: How cool. 
A: And we th Œ we thought that was Œ as kids, we thought that was great. Those are 

the little things I remember, but Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ our relationship with m y grandparent s was distant. 

Q: And why would that  be? 

A: Very warm. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Because chi Œ in those da ys, chi ldren Œ chil dren Œ as one of m y cousins famously 

said once, 
les enfants ne parle pas à table
. He was French. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Children are seen, but not heard. Which is t otally against everything that we 

believein, because we f
-figure that kids learn from talking with t heir parents, not the 
opposite. But in t hose days Œ now, what I have to add is t hat m y grandparents had 
a 
mai d, the cook, everything goes with it. And the maid, 
Lena
, was in charge of the 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
16
 
kids when they came to visit, and my Œ 
m y 
Œ m y aunt and uncle Œ 
El sa
(ph), the older 
sister, lived around the corner. My Œ m y grandparents had a big apartment. If you™ve 
ever been to 
Munich
, it™s one block from the Œ from the 
Oktoberfest
, from the 
Theresienwiese
. 

Q: Wow.
 
A: That™s where the y lived. And m y grandfather™s brother lived in the building next 
door. And m y aunt and uncle, now the y lived i n apart ment houses, very nice 

apartment houses where a floor was big. My aunt and uncle, 
Elsa
(ph), and her 

husband 
Karl
(ph) 
Heiman
(ph), t he y lived around the corner, they had a big vil la. 
And so, as kids, we spent a lot of time over there, because t heir kids were the same 

age as we were, approximately. But when we got to 
Munich
, t o Œ 
with my 
grandparent s, 
Lena
 was in charge of us. 
Lena
 took us pl aces, and Œ and then, you 
know, m y 
Œ m y grandmother, I don™t know what she di d, but she worked in the store 
with my grandfather. And the y came home, you know, they come home for lunch, 

and the y have a big lunch, the main meal, and then they take a nap. And then, I still 

have that problem, when I eat, I alwa ys have t o go to sleep. So don™t feed me too 

soon. The y Œ we were permitted t o stay up until my grandparents came home, about 

7:30, eight . We could spend 10 minutes with m y grandparents, and t hen pff, off to 

bed we went. So Œ 
Q: Formal. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
17
 
A: It was very formal. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: It was very formal. So Œ 

Q: But is Œ they al so sound like very nice memories. 

A: Oh yeah. Nobody was nasty. 
Q: Yeah. Oh, you know, from a childhood, you know, you Œ you™re painting a 
picture for us, you know, of the 
ba hnho f
, of th Œ of the Œ of the, you know, 
haberdashery store, ofthe 
Œ the tubes, and so on. That™s Œ that™s exactl y t he kind of, I 
guess, evoca Œ you know, I want t o have it  evoked. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What di d it look like, what did it feel like? 

A: Well, the Œ the Œ you know, from a sociological point of view, what this means is, 
because the y had a maid and a cook, that meant that the parents had t ime for other 
things. 

Q: That™s ri ght. 

A: Nowadays, parents spend 24 hours a da y catering to everybody, especially the 

mother. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So, you know, it™s a totally different world. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

Q: Well, when you look at houses here that were built for well-to-do people in t he 
late 19
th
, early 20
th
 centuries, there are often two staircases; one for the family, and 
one for the servants, you know. And to maintain such houses in those da ys Œ 

A: It took Œ 
yeah.
 
Q: Œ you couldn™t Œ you needed servants. And now Œ 
A: Yeah, I can tell you that the house I grew up in Œ if you like t o, m y wife can bring 
you a picture of it Œ was also a big house. 

Q: Tell me about it. Paint a picture about that. 

A: It was i n 
Redtenbacherstrasse
, number t wo, in Œ still standing Œ in 
Karlsruhe
. It 
Œ it was a 
ei ne familie
 house, 
a 
one family home. Nowadays, it™s four apart ments in 

it. But it Œ  it Œ you know, it had a basement, and the main floor. The main floor had 

the kitchen, the dining room, the l iving room, and 
das klavierzi mmer
. 
Q: My gosh, a piano room? 
A: A piano room. And which you were only permitted to go into when there was 

music being performed.  

Q: Well, who knew how to pla y? 

A: Well,
 that depends who came al ong. 

Q: Oh, but I mean in your family, was there somebody who knew how to pla y? 

A: My mother and father didn™t play. 
Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
19
 
A: No. But we had lots of relatives. 
Q: And did you have lessons? 

A: But the main thing was the Œ t he Œ the Œ the Œ you could call it  den now, because 

there was a Œ I don™t  know how you say it  in English Œ 
K achelofen
. There Œ

A: One of these stoves Œ 
Q: Œ ovens Œ 

A: Œ built in with Œ wit h tiles on i t, and with a bench around it, you could sit on the 

bench to warm yourself, cause you know, that  was the wa y it Œ everybody 

congregated there when it was Œ 
whenit was cold.
 
Q: So it was coal oven. It was a co Œ  
A: Coal oven, yeah, yeah.

our maidsallcamei n. We had mainlyone maid,shedid everythi ng. Sheraised m y

learned, you know Œ you don™t know yet Œ but I spent 25 years in 
Germany
 as an 
intelligence officer for the

thing that absolutely floored me, was that the kitchens were all abysmal . The 
kitchens were Œ I mean, the y were small. All of them, every single one. In 
Berlin
, in 
Munich
, t he Œ the Œ the kitchens and Œ and the one I Œ I Œ I grew up i n, as a child, 
they were all  a postage stamp. And the only theory I have developed is that, you 

know, this was for the 
angestellte
, you know, it was for the Œ 
Q: For the employees. 

A: Œ employees that di dn™t need much space, which is contrary t o everything I 

believe in, but Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ the Œ 
m y 
Œ m y wife and I, my late wife and I, in 
Berl in
, and Œ and in 
Muni ch
, 
the first thing we did when we moved into these houses i s to change t he kitchen. But 

you couldn™t enlarge it, there was no space, but you could change stove, and a few 
other things, you know, because it just wasn™t functional according to our concept. I 
had the good luck that t he houses I lived i n in 
Germany
 in my career were owned 
by the German government, and all I had t o do is pick up the telephone, call the 

American engineers, m ilitary engi neers, and say he y, I need this and this, and it  

came.
 
Q: Let me tell you, that  sounds li ke a dream renovation plan, you know. 

A: Well, we did Œ were weren™t able to renovate it that much, but  we were ab Œ 
able 
to update some thi ngs.

A: It was all German. I Œ we Œ the school that m y sister and I went to was one block 
from our house. So that was very nice. 

Q: Do you remember t he name? 

A: I Œ I know it as 
Volksschule in der Gartenstra
sse
. It ma y have had a name, I Œ 
but we always called it 
Gartenstrasse
, where i t was. 
Q: Oka y. And Œ oh, I just had a question in my mind. Your first years in school , do 

you have any memories of Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ your first school year? 

A: I spent Œ I went f or two years, I went to school Œ  

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ in 
Karlsruhe
, before we left. My sist er went three, at least. I think that was all. 
You know, first grade, second grade. I had been to a kindergarten, which was pri vate 
Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ before that, for a year. And I just remember Œ all I remember is I went to 

kindergarten, I remember the lady i n charge, and that™s about it. And then I went to 

first grade and second grade. Now, you have t o understand, I went to first grade in 

1932. 
Q: Oh m y. Okay.

A: Yeah, ™32. I have, if you™re interested, I have all m y report card books Œ 
Q: Do you?  

A: Œ from every place I™ve ever been. You ni Œ  you have to understand Germans ke-

keep everything. I mean, the y Œ the y have Œ 
we defeated 
Germany
 
because the 
Germans hold everyt hing 
down. Andthe documentation 
Œ the documentation of 
Germany
 Œ when we t ook over

 Œ I™m wa y out  of Œ 
Q: That™s oka y, that™s oka y. 
A: Œ what we™re talking about, but when we took over 
Germa ny
, if anyt hing you Œ 
you wanted to know, I mean, it™s t here somewhere. You just have to find it. Because 

everything Œ records are kept, and t he y™re written. 

Q: Your work is done for you, huh? 

A: Work is done for you, and Œ but m y report card for first and second grade, I have. 
I can show them to you. 
Q: Now, what wer
e your 
Œ did you have friends who were non-Jewish? 
A: Yes. The Œ on 
Redtenbacherstrasse
, about two or three houses down, there was 
a family, and his name was 
Peitken
(ph), and t hey had two boys, and the older one 
was my sister™s age, and the younger one was 
m y age.That mean 
Œ meant that the 
older one was in the same grade as m y sister, and I was Œ and the younger ones was 

in my class. And t he y were friends of ours. The younger one, 
Gurz
(ph), was in m y 
grade. The minute t he 
Hitler
 movement started, he became turned, and he woul dn™t

want to pla y with me any more, and he called me a dirty Jew, and a few other thi ngs. 
The older one always Œ 

Q: Did he even know what he was sa ying? 

A: No, of course not. The older one never did that. He alwa ys remained friendl y. But 

there were, in my class of, I™m guessing 25 kids, there were four Jewish boys. I was 
one of four, and my sister was about the same. At the begi nning, we had no problem 
at all, but once 
Hitler
 came to power, it became i mmediately Œ anybody who tell s 

you t
hat act ions against the Jews in 
Germany
 started with 
Kristallnacht
 is Œ 
doesn™t know what  he™s talking about. It started right from the Œ the first, 

immediately, in ™33. 

Q: And you felt Œ and you felt it in school? 

A: Oh yeah, they st arted Œ 
every morning 
they had to raise the swasti ka flag, and 
the y had to sing the Œ t he Œ the Nazi national anthem, the 
Horst-Wessel-Lied
, you 
know. De file Œ I can si ng it for you, you know. 

Q: I mean, i t™s Œ it™s bit tersweet, but what do you remember? T-Tell me, what do 

you
 remember from Œ 
A: Well, I can Œ I get Œ I know the words for t he 
Horst-Wessel-Lied
 because we had 

to sing it every morning. And then, you know, the first year, I don™t remember who 

m y teacher was the first year. It ma y have been the same one, but I don™t remember 
that. The second year, I had a guy by the name of 
Meininger
(ph), who turned out to 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
26
 
be the head of the Nazi party in the area. And so, he took every opportunity to make 
snide remarks about the Œ the Jewish kids. And Œ 

Q: Well, that™s very cruel, you™re children Œ  
A: Oh, he was Œ and you know, my sister always laughs about it, but she alwa ys 

lucked out. Her Œ her teacher was the nicest guy in the world, always. And I always 
got these Œ these Œ you know, this Œ 
this wasa tough age.I mean, you know,
 I was 
what, seven years ol d, eight years old, seven years old. And if you di d anything 

wrong, you know Œ he had a stick, and you had to stick your hand out, and he went Œ 

you know, and it burned. And you know, he wasn™t careful with Jewish kids, I mean, 

there™s all these littl e, more than i nnuendoes. It was picked on, you know, and t here 

with watch Œ they woul d watch us. We had to salute, or something, when the flag 

was raised every morni ng, and they would wat ch us. And if Œ if the 
Meininger
(ph) 
felt like Œ like it, he sai d well, you didn™t stand at attention when we were playing 
the 
Horst- Wessel- Lied
. Stuff like that. All this little stuff, you know. 

Q: But again, in m y mi nd, I™m thinking of a grown person, a grown Œ an adult, and 

you™re not even grown children, you™re littl e kids, you know? 

A: I™m just  a little kid, yeah. 

Q: You™re little kids, six or seven years old. 

A: Seven years old. 
Q: Seven years old, and he™s picking on l ittle kids.

A: Yeah. Well, but he was a Nazi, you know, the y don™t know t he dif
ference.
 
Q: And, was your fami ly religious? 
A: 
Jein
. 

Q: I love that German expression 
jein
.  
A: 
Jein
 
means yeah, yes,and 
nein
. So if it™s so-
so, you know.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: My mother was Œ tended to be. She grew up in 
Muni ch
, in t he Jewish yout h 

movement, she was a l eader in a Jewish youth movement in 
Munich
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: My dad couldn™t Œ get awa y farther from religion than he possibly could. The 

only ti me he ever went in a synagogue 
is whenhe married m y mother,a
nd that was 

the first and the last  ti me. 
Q: Was there a reason why for hi m? Did he ever explain i t?  
A: I think t he answer t o your question is no. Unfortunately, m y sister and I have 

often bemoaned the fact that we never found out anything about Dad, about th Œ 

well, he died young, too, so the years when you would have done that, ma ybe, but 

we could have found out somethi ng when he was young. We only know tidbit s about 

hi m. He Œ our impressi on is that t here was this Œ there were a lot of Jews in 

Germany
 that wanted so badly to be German, that the y Œ being Jewish was Œ 
Q: Something you wanted to get awa y from. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

28
 
A: Yeah, or at least you ignore
dit. Now, he married m y mother,and 
Œ in a Jewish 
wedding, that Œ but it was Œ it was an arranged wedding, so that  Œ 
Q: So he still Œ I mean, he still Œ if it was an arranged wedding, that means he agreed 

in an old traditional  way, t o find a wife and a bride, not i n a new modern wa y, but in 

a way that Œ 
A: Well, my mother 
Œ you know, I™ve read some of this stuff with Œ earlier 
heirs. M
y 
mother belonged to a generation that was not subserv Œ where the wi m Œ 
as a 
woman, she was not subservient to men, which was a new thing. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And she had her own Œ she was well educated, better t han her sibl ings. My father 

was educated better t han his sibli ngs, and I think that was the common denominator. 

The yboth wentto the university
 Œ Mother went to 
höhertesteschule
(ph). I don™t 
know how to translate that. 

Q: I don™t ee Œ I don™t understand. 

A: It™s a Œ i t™s a Œ well, it™s above Œ it™s above high school. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It™s not university, but it™s for Œ for girls from families that had the mone y to send 

them to another school, the y Œ they Œ they did. And she was Œ she was very well 

educated. But my father served for four years i n the German army, in World War I. 
Got the Iron Cross, and the whole deal.  

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
29
 
Q: Was he a patriot? 
A: Yes. And that™s something that has not writ  Œ been writ ten about Œ enough, about 

the Œ the Œ the pre- war, pre-
Hitler
 
Germany
, but th-there were a l ot of them who 
were patriot s. He was very proud t o have served in the German army. And that™s one 

of the reasons why so Œ and then 
H itler
 came, in ™33, a
nd immedi atel y, Jewswere 
scum. And my father, who was a man of great integrity, he Œ he couldn™t accept that. 
And that™s why he left. He left in Œ he started leaving in ™34, it took t wo years to do 

the whole move. 

Q: And there are two Œ there Œ we™ll  come t o that in a moment, but there™s an 

impression that I get from your telling, that Œ 
andtell me whether or notthisis an 
accurate impression Œ one, it must have been extremely painful. If you had Œ 
if you 

si Œ identified yourself with a nati on and a people, and all of a sudden you™re thrown 
out of that, it™s a real Œ it™s a personal rejecti on. Then Œ 
A: Yes, especially if you just finished serving four years, risking 
your life 
Œ 
Q: Life. 

A: Œ for the country that™s doing it  to you. 

Q: Yeah. So that Œ I mean, I™m sus Œ that™s the i mpression I would get, if you Œ if 

you believed in it, if you put your heart and soul into it, and put your life on the line, 

this is Œ this is personal . Number t wo, there™s a great deal of foresight in that. Very 
few people left in 1933, ™34, ™35 Œ you know, most were saying, it Œ it™ll blow over.

A: Yes. 
Q: You know? He™s not someone t o take seriously. All t he intell igent  people don™t 

take hi m seriously, you know, and so on and so forth. Was Œ was that  part of your 

par Œ your father™s deci sion making, too? Was he calculating, in that way? 

A: Well, I t hink Œ I thi nk Œ I can™t prove it  Œ 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ but I think that the reason we went to 
Franc
e
 is because of that. That all of his 
relatives, on both sides of the family, said 
[speaks other language]
 you know, all 

this will go awa y.
 Hitl er 
won™t last, the others didn™t. And so they didn™t leave. And 

so my father, I guess argued with hi mself that if he went t-to 
France
, when it™s all 
over, he can come back. 

Q: Yeah, it™s not so far. 
A: Yeah. So he didn™t Œ th-the considerati on of going to the 
United States
, at t hat 
particular ti me, if it came up for discussi on, I never heard i t.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: So I don™t think it did. So we went to 
France
. Whereas, on his side of the family, 

everybody sta yed.They were 
Œ well, I™ll tell you a little bit about his family, but Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ the Œ on m y mother™s side, the Œ the l eader, kind of, in Mot her™s side of the 
fa
mily was her sister al  Œ 
Elsa

Karl

 Heiman

wealthy, had a big t exti le business, and he knew everybody in government, and 
elsewhere. And, you know, the y kind of pooh-poohed the fact that dad wanted to 

leave 
Germany
. 
Q: And di d Dad want t o leave 
Germany
 because he was so hurt, or because he sai d 
mm- mm, nothing good out of this. 
A: It™s hard to answer. It™s probably both. I Œ he was hurt. He had quote unquote, 
loyal customers for years, butchers mainly, who one day when he, or his 

representative walked in to see him, said we don™t do business with dirt y Jews. 

Q: Oh. 

A: And so, you know, you only need to hear t hat a few times before you Œ before 

you sa y h ey,
 do I have to put up with this? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: So it was Œ but the fact that he had been i n the military for four years during t he 
war, definitely played into it, because his Œ his brothers Œ well, one of them was i n 

the military, I don™t  know much about that, but an-and his Œ on my m other™s side of 

the family, nobody was ever close to that. And you know, there™s lots been written, 

I™ve read a lot. I have a book writt en by a German, at the request of the German 

Minister of Defense, that™s in my f Œ later life, and Œ which explai ns what being a 

Jew in Œ in 
Germany
 was like in 1
914, when
 the Kaiser said Œ when the Kaiser said 
to the Germans, you must all come fight with me for the Œ so on. The Jews Œ th-the 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

grand 
rabbi in 
Berlin
, and I got hi s words, I got his sermon, had a Œ had a service in 
which he said, we Jews must Œ 
we must
 answer the call of the Kaiser. The grand 
rabbi of 
Berlin
. So that was the frame of mind. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And that was the frame of mind of many German Jews. 
Q: Let™s tur Œ let™s turn a little bit to a different area, but we™ll come back to this. 
Tell me a bi t about your parents™ personalit ies;  your mother™s personality, your 

father™s personality. What kind of people were the y? 

A: Well, m y mother had a never-ending social  conscience. She Œ all of her life she 

was alwa ys doing t hings for other people. She started as a student in 
Munich
. She 
was the head of the Jewish youth, and I Œ I have some let ters in my documents, 

where the Œ the Œ the council of Jewish Œ the Jewish congregation sent her a letter 
thanking her for having led the effort during the elections, and wit hout her, it never 
would have happened. She was like this all her life, as I will explain t o you later. 

Wit hout that kind of consciousness, I wouldn™t be sitting here. But m y dad was very 

intelligent. He was mainl y, in the years that I knew him, he wa
s mai nly consumedin 

making a living, which became ever more difficult in 
Germany
, because of what I 
said. And then when he went to 
France
, nothi ng really worked. 

Q: We™ll come to that. 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: We™ll come to that. But, as far as Œ who di d you go t o when you wanted to tell 
something 
about what wasgoing onin yourday, in your life?
 
A: Mother.  

Q: Yeah? Oka y. Same with your sister? 

A: Yeah. My father favored my sister over me, but m y si ster, we have a strain in the 
family, of petite woman, my sister had that strain. My father had a sister who was 
petite, and my Œ m y grandmother, whom I never knew, m y father™s mother, was very 

petite. I think that™s where the line i s. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: 
Then my Aunt 
Josephine
 was like that. My sister is four foot 10, ma ybe. 

Q: Oka
y.
 
A: And Œ and so she al ways was pale, and my father always protected her, so that Œ 
you know, and I was just the boy.  
Q: That™s j ust not fair. 

A: It™s all ri ght, it didn™t bother me. You know, I did m y own thi ng, but it just Œ so 

m y father was more Œ 
I d
on™t think she tal ked that much more wit h hi m than I di d. 
You know, in those days, fathers would say t o you, are you doing your homework, 

as he went whizzing through the room. And it was just that kind of a world. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Mother was concerned with all of the things we did.

A: That was her job. 

Q: Do you remember how they broke it to you that, we™re l eaving 
Karlsruhe
? You 
know, was it an advent ure, we™re going someplace, or was it, we got t o get out of 

here? Do you remember them telli ng you about it? 
A: No. I Œ what led up to it, what I said before, let™s start it from the beginning. We 
witnessed a number of things happening Œ  

Q: Such as?  

A: Œ around us. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The one Œ for example, the y arrested Jews from the beginning. I mean, in 1933, 

the people who were judges, and university professors, and in charge of the opera, at 
any position, who were Jewish, were out of a j ob. And they arrested people. There 
was a family that we were friendly with, he Œ he was the Minister of Justice of Œ of 

whatever it was then, 
Ba den
? It was in 
Ba den
-Württemberg 
then. But Œ and he 
was a socialist, and so he ha Œ and he was Jewish. So he had three stri kes against 

hi m, and he got arrested in the first bunch, and what they did, they put them on open 

trucks, and the y drove them through the city of 
Karlsruhe
, so that people could spit 

at them. 
Q: This was the Nazis?

A: Yeah. 
Q: Nazi Œ you know Œ 

A: Yeah, they were the Brownshi rts. The 
SS
, we didn™t see, but t he Brownshirts, 
there was Brownshirts all over the place. And they were just, you know, and the y 

had signs, 
J uden ra us
, whatever. Whatever one through the ages I™ve seen, the y had 
it. And Œ and Œ and the people on these trucks went to a concentrati on camp that 

you™ve never heard of before, and I can™t rem ember. But Œ  

Q: Was it local? 

A: Local, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. So it started from the beginning.  

Q: Did you ever have these pleasant visits at your home? 
A: No. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Not that  I remember, because it didn™t Œ I don™t think the y started before ™35. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Ma ybe even later. But the y did arrest peopl e the y didn™t like.
 Hitler
 didn™t Œ 

Hitler
 didn™t like, I don™t know i n what order, trade unionists, sociali sts, Jews,

two lists, heaven forbid, you know. Then Catholics. He had a big war going on with

Q: Interesti ng. I thi nk he was born Catholi c, wasn™t he? 
A: I have no idea. It  was a mistake that he was born. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The Œ the Œ the Œ I mean, when you think about the psychology of it, the Œ 
Hitler
 

was a little guy wit h dark hair, 
a 
brown mustache, and 
he said
 that to be a good 

German, you had to be blonde and blue e yed. Now where Œ how does he fit into this 
thing, you know? So that people fell for this, t hat is unbel ievable
, but 
Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ that™s Œ 
Q: There are some things that don™t have logical explanati ons. 

A: The y don™t have logic, yeah. 

Q: Do you remember l eaving 
Karlsruhe

A: Not really. I™ll tell you why. I said before t hat we left in ™34, ™35, and that™s a true 

statement. We left, step by step, it wasn™t that we left.

A: Œ same t hing. Around the corner. 

Q: The ones who didn™t want to leave? 
A: The ones who didn™t want to leave. And well, in those da ys you didn™t talk that 
much about  it, but that Œ you know, we were j ust sent to 
Munich
, or taken to 
Munich
, I guess, m y mother took us. And we sta yed with my aunt and uncle and 
their three kids, I woul d sa y, for three or four months. And Œ 
and
 that was in ™34. 
Ma ybe the fall of ™34 Œ I Œ the fall of ™34. After school Œ t here was no school. The 

new school  year was st arting, but it was at the end of ™34. And then, after that, we 

were shipped from t here Œ shipped to Œ to 
Ma
n

, t o sta y with my father™s 
oldest brother, and his wife. We sta yed wit h t hem for three or four months. And then 

we were sent to 
Switzerland
. My father had a sister in the 
Zurich
 area, and her 
husband was a teacher out in the country. And we were sent there for three or four 

months. And we sta yed with them on a farm. 

Q: It sounds like ﬁ
Heidi

A: It sounds like ﬁ
Heidi
.ﬂ We were on a farm, and I Œ I was Œ I didn™t go to school 
that whole year, and I was Œ I would go out every morni ng with the farmer, who 
owned the farm, a Œ out in the fields, and where the y put hay together, and I was

permitted to feed the cows, and stuff like that, you know. It was a new world for me. 
And so the whole thing, that Œ that 
Munich
,
 
Ma nnheim
, 
Switzerland
, that was 
about a year.  

Q: What were they doi ng, your parents? 

A: The y were Œ the y were setting up Œ the y were taking care of the formalities 
required to move to 
France
. I can™t tell you where the y lived at the ti me, whether 
they Œ probably partiall y in 
Germany
, and partially in Œ i n 
F-
France
, 
but the y 
weren™t anywhere where we were. The y came every once in a whil e t o see us, of 

course. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But so it Œ it™s in September of ™35, that  we left 
Switzerland
, and moved to 

Marseilles
. 
Q: So, I have a few questions. Do you know if your father was able to sell his 
business, or did he have to leave it? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I assume he sol d it, but I Œ the y Œ they didn™t take things away from you yet, at 

that ti me. 

Q: And when Œ when you moved t o 
Marseilles

your own personal belongings with you? Was there furniture, was t his Œ

A: Yes. 
Q: You Œ 
so your household,did itcome with you?
 
A: Yes. 

Q: Oka y. And why 
Marseilles
? 
A: My father had a good friend who was a businessman i n 
Marseilles
. I think that™s 
the reason. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: He helped hi m get established. 

Q: Oka y. So he didn™t know what Œ many other people in 
France
, and this person Œ 
I™m making that assumption. 

A: Yeah, he Œ he Œ t his person was an Œ ori ginall y from
 Austria
. His namewas
 
Charles Pollack
(ph). And he had a Œ he was an i mporter/exporter in 
Marseilles
, and 
he was a friend of his, and so he Œ he was Œ I Œ I™m sure the reason why the y were 
very closely connect ed when we first got there. 

Q: Oka y. So tell me, what was 
Marseilles
 like? When you get there, you™re eight 

years old, nine years old, somethi ng like t hat? What was t he world  Œ what was t he 

impression? What was your firstimpression?
 
A: Well, the y tried t o teach us a lit tle French i n 
Ma nnhei m
, so that we wouldn™t be 
totally lost. And t he one sentence I can remem ber is the,

Ferme la porte

Q: That sounds li ke a rhyme. 

A: Yeah, it is. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. But we di dn™t  know much French, but so the y decided t he y Œ the powers 
that be Œ that means my father and mother, decided to send us to private school. 
Now, you have to remember, in those da ys Œ I don™t know how it  is today, but in 

those da ys, boys and gi rls never went to school together. Boys™ schools and girls™ 

schools. 

Q: But were these religious schools? Were these Œ 

A: No. 

Q: No. The y were simply private schools. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: Just Œ I was sent to a thing called 
[speaks French]
, it was a private school, not 
too far from where we lived. My sister went t o a thing called 
[speaks French] 
which 
was in a different direction, but about the same distance. And we were there to learn 
French. And I was there, I would sa y, two semesters, to learn French, and then both 

of us transferred to the 
l ycée
. I went  to the boys™ 
lycée
, when I was 10, I guess. I 
went to the boys™ lycée, and she went to t he gi rls™ lycée. Mine was called 

Sa nsha l
(ph), but it was not religious, it was public. And hers was Lycée 
Toma
(ph) 
same thing, public. 

Q: Well, how Œ how di d it compare to school i n 
Germany
?  What were the 
si milarities, what were the differences? 

A: I think I have to think about that. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: I don™t think I Œ I™ve given that a thought. It Œ anything French is different from 
anyt hing German. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: 
France
 i s more flui d. 
Germany
 is 
[makes sound effect]
 
especiall y under 
Hi tler
.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: In m y book I™ve wri tten that when I came back to 
Germany
 a-as a Œ 
as a 
lieutenant in 1953, and I was on a t rain from 
Bremerhaven
 to 
Frankfurt
, and I 
looked out the window and I said Œ it all reminded me of everybody living in a box.

Nothing is like that, it™s all Œ it still is toda y, i n m y opini on. Not the same wa y, but 
the Germans have a certain wa y of being, and t he French have a certai n way of 

being. 

Q: Oka y, so ma ybe I should put the questi on this wa y; what was school like for you 

in 
Marseill es
?  
A: I had no problem. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: I did well in Œ i n 
[speaks French]
, you know, I can show you the report cards. 

And then went to lycée, and I Œ the classes weren™t that bi g. I would say about 20. I 

can count that for you, but it was about 20, maybe a little more. And I started in what 

Œ you know, in 
France
, the Œ it goes the other way. The 
neuvième
, the ninth grade is 
Œ is Œ or 
dixième
, 10
th
 grade is for little kids, and it goes down to one, which is for 
17, 18 years old. 

Q: Boy, would that confuse me. 

A: Yeah, well, it™s just the other wa y around. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So I started in 
neuv i ème
 Œ  
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ in the Œ in the ninth grade, and by Œ 
by the 
ti me I was in the eighth grade, in 
huitième
, youknow, you 
Œ you had to take exams, and everything, in main subjects,

and in 
huitième
, t here were subject French, Latin, mathematics, geography, history. 
And in 
huitiè
me
, which meansI wasin 
Œ in 
France
 two years, I got the first place in 
French. And did that cal Œ cause an upset i n the school. 
Q: Well, yes.
 

A: I mean, t he Œ the teacher Œ the teacher, who was very French, a lady teacher, she 
stood in front of the class, and she practical ly screamed at them. Sai d, a little 
German kid comes in here, and he has the first place in French? And, well, I had t o 

work harder , you know? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: For me it was always had to start from scrat ch, and I had to really put work i nto 

this. The others, the y just sat there and enjoyed themselves. 

Q: So this is interesting, she called you the little German ki d? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Was that  how everybody saw you there, as you™re the German kid? Is that how 

people saw you and your family i n 
Marseilles
? 
A: Well, yeah, I guess so, yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: You know, there are other stories that I didn™t Œ 
all m y ki 
Œ m y friends were, you 
know, French kids. We were Œ we were all buddies. I mean, I™ve Œ I met  them until I 
was over seven years old. The Œ the Œ we Œ lycée was kind of a protected society, 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
44
 
very well organized, and you knew what you could do, and what you couldn™t do, 
and you learned, and you had good teachers or bad teachers, like everywhere else. 

We had mostly good teachers. And so, you know, I liked lycée very much. So did 

m y sister. My sister was the top student i n her l ycée.  

Q: My question was more to your Œ you™ve moved from 
Germany
 t o 
France
, and 
are yo
u i mmigrants, are you refugees? And how did the people in 
Marseilles 
look at 
you, identify you? How Œ you know, how do you fit in as a family, as Œ 

A: Well, we Œ we were Œ rented an apartment, which we kept the entire time, in a 

middle class neighborhood. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: There were certain things that were pri mitive. Like we lived on the top floor of 

five stories, and no elevators or anyt hing like this. The bathroom had a tub, but no 
hot water. And it was Œ 
Q: Was it a step down from 
Karlsruhe
 in modern conveniences? 

A: Yeah, it was falling off the mountain. It  was a step down, but as kids you don™t 

realize it. Our parent s saw to it that we had everyt hing we needed. We never went 

hungry. We went to school, we had a regulated life, and we had friends. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And even though for adults we were called German refugees, I guess, I don™t  
think any of them, or most of them didn™t understand that Œ why we had come there. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

So, you know, when the war started, the Œ t he Œ we had to i mpress people that we 
knew with the fa
ctthat wewere much more at dangerthan the ywere. Becauseto 

them, they were just Frenchmen. We were Germans who had left 
Germany
 
because 
of 
Hitler
. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And so it Œ that was totally different thing, but Œ 
Q: Were there many others like you, at that time, in ni Œ in the mid-30s, in 

Marseilles
?  

A: There were some. We had some neighbors two houses down that were in the 

same situation. Not too many.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: The Œ the Œ the Œ there were two Œ there were two aspects. One is, were there any 
other Jewish people Œ 
Q: Yes, that™s one Œ 

A: Œ French Jews. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And the other is, what about the German refugees? Now, the German refugees, 

there were a number of them. Some of them were doctors, for exampl e. Our doct or 

was alwa ys somebody who was a German Jew. And even there, you have to spl it 
hairs, because a lot of them came from the 
Saarland
. The 
Saarland
 was French 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
46
 
from World War I, unti l 1935 or six, when they had a 
plebiscite
, and the yopted to 
go with 
Germany
. And so the Jewish people in 
Saarland
, when this happened, 
moved int o 
France
 because the y™d been living in 
France
, and that  was the natural  
thing. A lot of people from 
Saarl and
, who lived in 
France
 afterwards, after the 

Saar
 opted to go back to 
Germany
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: So, our doctor was one of those, and there were a number of people like that, but 

not many. Now, the Jewish people, I suspected if m y parents had been religious, they 

could have become more active, but that was not m y father™s cup of tea. And m y 

mother was alwa ys conciliatory. And she did t ake m y sister and me t o the services at 

theJewish synagogue, the mainone 
Œ there were several Œ but the m ain one, for the 
high holida ys. 
Q: So it wasn™t regular, it was just  sort of Œ 
A: Just Œ j ust Œ 

Q: Just for the high holidays. 

A: Œ Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And Œ but otherwise we didn™t. And the French Jews did not Œ 
any generalization 
is Œ is bad, but generally speaking, the French Jews were not particularl y interested 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
47
 
in German Jews. They were not nasty or anyt hing, but the y Œ they didn™t understand 
that we were all in t he same boat, as it turned out to be later. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But so, there was one family that was very nice. Well-known fami ly that invi ted 

us, and stuff like that, but generally speaking, there was no effort on part of the Œ the 
Œ the French Jews i n 
Marseilles
 for an outreach towards t he Jews from other 
countries that had showed up. 

Q: It was Œ  it was t oo early for that consciousness. Is that what Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. Well, what about your friends then, did you Œ so 
Itake it mostof your 

friends were not Jewish in 
Marsei lles
? 

A: All of my friends were not Jewish. 
Q: All of your friends were not Jewish. Well, did you ever Œ if you went to the 
synagogue on high holi days, did you ever go with them to Œ  

A: Catholi c mass? 

Q: Yeah, di d you?  

A: Sure. 

Q: Yeah?  

A: I know more abou-bout French Catholi cism than I know about French 
[indecipherable]
. I grew up, you know, i n a world that was all Œ t hat™s why some of 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
48
 
the things that happen i n this country, I don™t understand, because I grew up in a 
Catholic country. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: There Œ there was no Œ no challenge to the Catholic church. And the Catholic 

church in 
France
 is very subdued, but they™re there. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And you know, you Œ if you were Catholic, as my best friend was, anyt hing we 
did, like we became Boy Scouts.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: Anythi ng that we di d Œ if we left at seven o™clock on Sunda y morning to go 

camping, or go out somewhere on the coast, or somethi ng, he™d get up at four and go 

to mass. And Œ and Œ and at seven o™clock, he was where he was supposed to be. 
Nobody ever talked about the fact that he™d gone to mass. If I hadn™t  known hi m so 
well, I Œ I wouldn™t  have known it. But, you know, that religion was a private part of 

your life. And 
France
 t o this day, you know, i s very secular. I mean, very secular. 

That Œ the Œ  
Dallas 
Œ you don™t know thi s, but 
Dallas
 has a school called the 
Dallas
 

International School, which the word internati onal you can questi on, because it™s 

totally French. I mean, from the top guy down it™s French, and the y speak French, 

and the kids all know French, learn French, and so on. But it sa ys on the Œ on a bi g 
sign, that t his is a 
école laïque
, a lay school.  

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
49
 
Q: Ah, secular school. 
A: Secular school. Don™t misunderstand, t his is not a French Cat holic school. This is 

a secular school. 

Q: And why is thi s such a articulated distincti on? 

A: It™s the French const itution. Separation of church and state is i n the French 
constitution. 
Q: And it permeated down, and act ually means something Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ at Œ 
at
 an everyday level. 
A: Now the French Œ French Catholics Œ like everything el se in life, there are many 

exceptions, but the French Catholics are not super-religious. But  they do get married 

in the church, and they Œ they go to the fu-funerals in the church, and t he Œ there™s 
certain things that happen. 
Q: So how did it come about that you went to mass?  

A: Oh, because m y friends were Œ were Œ were Catholic, and they took me along. 

Was interesting to find out what ot her people do. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I never felt I was anyt hing special, you know, I like to know how other people 

live. If he™s my best friend, I want to know what makes him tick, you know. 
Q: Yeah. That™s true. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: And it Œ it was never a problem. You know, I didn™t go every Sunday or anything 
like that, b ut Œ 

Q:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
A: Œ if there was a special occasion. 

Q: But it means you had exposure. 
A: Had exposure. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: It was not a strange thing. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I can tell you Œ t his is a story you™ve never heard, but Œ  

Q: Oka y. 

A: The father of one of m y best friends passed away, and t he y had the funeral in the 
church. And in the Cat holic ceremony, in 
France
, I don™t  know how it is here, t he Œ 
the Œ the Œ the coffin is covered by a cloth, and it™s in the middle Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ everybody is around it. And then, at a certain point i n the cerem ony, everybody 

gets the Œ what is a scepter, what i s a li-little t hing that t he priest bless things with, 

you know, one of these things. It™s got a name. 

Q: I don™t remember.

A: But, you know, and the priest will hand that  to the person next to hi m, family 
first, and everybody stands around the coffin and, you know, you make the sign of 

the cross. Well, you know, I was 10 years old. When that thing got to me, what do I 

do now, you know? I was trying real hard t o look at everybody else and wha Œ 

what™s goi ng on here, you know?  
Q: How do you Œ yeah, how do you do this? 
A: But, you learn t hat way, you know? 

Q: Uh-huh. And was B
oy 
Scouts fun? Did you like 
Boy S
couts?  
A: Yeah. You know, Boy S
couts were 
Éclaireurs Unionist
es
 
de
 
France
. Now, you 
had the mai n boy scouts in 
France

ec 
Œ Scouts de

Q: Oka y. Okay. 
A: 
Éclaireurs Unionistes

 were the Protestant s scout s.

A: The y were organized by secular Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: No, the y were organized by some religi ous order.  

Q: Oka y.

strong Catholic Œ why we belonged to the 
Éclaireurs Unionistes de France
 is 
because it was one block from our house. It was convenient. 
Q: Location, location, l ocation. 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And there were al so the 
Eclaireurs Israeli de France
. 
Q: Oh, was there? 

A: But I di dn™t choose to join them. The y were on the other side of town anywa y, 

they were Œ would have been so complicated, that Œ 
you know. 
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But, so I belonged t o the Œ to t he Protestant scouts. I Œ whatever, you know. 

Q: Oka y. How Œ how were things going for your father, in supporting the family? 
What was he doing, what was he tryi ng to do? 
A: In
 France
? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: He tried to be an em Œ i mporter-exporter, as he was, in a wa y, before. He Œ he Œ 
specializing on sausage casings, that he knew everything about, and Œ and spices. 

And so he, again, dealt with butchers. 

Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: But Œ and he di d that. He must have made some mone y, otherwise we wouldn™t 
have eaten, or paid the rent. But t he Œ the main problem was polit ical, or 

administrative, in a sense that the French police, the security Œ 
Sûreté
, that dealt 
with foreigners, was tot all y unpredi ctable. You never knew. My parents had a 

residence permit, I beli eve by the year. Every year the y had to renew it. And so, I™m 
guessing, i n ™37 or eight, probably closer to seven, but maybe somewhere at the end 
of seven, beginning of eight, he went on a business trip to the f Œ Swiss border, t o 

Basel
. And he was in 
Basel
 visiti ng clients, and then he said Œ 
he had acli
ent over 

on the other side. 

Q: Beani Œ meaning where?  

A: In
 Switzerland
. 

Q: In
 Switzerland
. 
A: But you know, 
Basel
 is right on the border. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And it™s parch Œ partially the suburbs. I mean, in

The downt own is i n 
Swi

. And Œ  
Q: Excuse me for a second, can we cut? I hear music. 
[break] 
Oka y, so your father™s 

in 
Basel
, visiting a client, and Œ 

A: Well, he Œ the wa y it went is, he went to the border Œ 
Q: Oka y.

A: Œ 
where the 
Œ 
they had 
Œ if you ever tried to get into 
Switzerland
, you know 
that™s a maj or job. They Œ  he went  to the border station at  the French side, and asked 
them whether he could go to 
Switzerland
, to 
Basel
, just to visit a client. And the 
guy in the Œ in the French custom house, or custom, or ma ybe i mmigration police, 

whatever the p Œ the guy was, said, well you gotta go over there, and ask. So he went 
to the Swi ss guy, on Œ you know, hundred feet, maybe. And he said, this is who I 
am, and I™d like to visit  a client. And so the y accused hi m of having crossed the 

border illegally. 

Q: Oh m y. 

A: And so they di dn™t do much, except they made note of it. And then he went back 

to Œ and he did go over, but he went back t o 
Marseilles
, and from t hen on, in his 
police record, it said in 
Marseilles
 that he crossed the border illegally. And that was 
added to the following historic 
fact.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: That m y mother and m y dad were in 
Marseilles
, I believe around t he 20
th
 of 
October, 1934, to l a y things out. 

Q: So this  is before you even moved there. 
A: And the y Œ they were downtown. The king of 
Yugoslavia
, 
Alexander 
the first, 

came on a state visit , and he went in a motorcade down t he Œ the 
Canebiere
, which 
is the main street in 
Marseilles
. And they were standing i n front of Œ front of the

stock exchange, and wi thin, I don™t know, a hundred feet of them, King
 Alexander
 
was shot by a Croatian terrorist, and the French foreign minister, 
Barthou
, was 
wounded seriously. And because the y were so worried about 
Alexander
, the y forgot 

about 
Barthou
, and he bled to deat h. And so 
Alexander 
was Œ King 
Alexander 
was 
killed, and so was 
Barthou
. And all of the foreigners who were in 
Marseilles
 on 
that da y, got put in a register. And when this thing Œ when the Swiss border came up, 

there now were two facts against him. He was in 
Mars
eill es
 when the king of 
Yugoslavia
 was assassinated, which he obviously had absolutely nothing to do with, 

but he was there. 

Q: Yeah, okay. 

A: And then he crossed the border i nto 
Switzerland
 illegally. And that haunted hi m 
from Œ from then on. 
Q: Bureaucracy, you know, sort of Œ 
A: And you know, in the French police, you had Œ you had good guys and bad guys, 

like everywhere else, and so this was Œ so that  was in ™34. In ™37 Œ eight, he had that 

Swiss thi ng, and the Œ t he next ti me the y went to extend their Œ their Œ their Œ 
it ma y 

Œ I don™t know whether it was the next ti me, or the time afterwards, when the y went 

to extend their annual Œ

A: Œ residence visa, they arrested them, b
ot h my pa
rents, for being i n 
France
 
illegally. And Œ 

Q: But that™s not t rue, because the y had all the permit Œ oka y, 
it doesn™t matter.
 
A: Well, truth Œ truth di Œ truth is uni mportant  when somebody wants to do 

something who has police power.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And so they kept my father, and the y let  my mother go because she had two 

children. I was about 12, 13, and m y sist er was 13, 14. 

Q: So this would have been ™37 Œ ™38? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: It was definitely before the war. And th-the strange thi ng about it Œ there are 
many strange things about it, but one of them was that that particular afternoon, m y 

sister and I had been invited to the home of one of her teachers for her son™s birt hda y 

party. And my sister was invited, and they let come along, because my parents had to 

go to the police. And you know, and all t he kids left, and m y sister and I were there, 

and Mother didn™t show up. And then ulti mat el y she did show up. And she wal ked in 

the door, and she said, the y have arrested m y husband. And it so happens that this 

teacher™s husband was a high poli ce official, and Œ which helped, because obviously 
they knew who we were, they knew us and they were friendly. But nevertheless, m y

mother was out on temporary whatever, my dad was in jail. In jai l, where the y put 
hi m in a cel l with a Œ with a guy who killed a captain in th
e es 
Œ a guy who killed a 
captain in t he French harbor. And the y put  m y father in with hi m, because he was 

from 
Switzerland
, they boy spoke German. 

Q: Well, there™s somet hing in common, you know. 
A: You know, I mean a Œ it Œ the circumstances of Œ of some of these things is just 
unbelievabl e. So m y dad was in jail, which I think did more to attack his health t han 

anyt hing else, because he was a Œ again, a man of great integrity. Now he™s sitti ng in 

a French jail. French jails are not known t o be exactly nic
e places. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And so after about a month Œ and I have no idea whether it was Œ i t was quite a 

while. I don™t know, it was four week, six weeks, whatever it was, they Œ  they 
brought him up for trial , and he was acquitt ed. So he came home. But he was very 
much taken by this. But m y mother wasn™t tried, hadn™t been tried, because she was 

a separate case, I guess. And so a little while l ater the y Œ t he y tried her. And they 

found her guilty. And so, really Œ  

Q: And so what happened to her? 

A: Well, they Œ they expelled her from 
France
. And so you say, what do you do? 
Well, her sister, the sister from 
Munich
, t he wealthy people from 
Munich

Œ after Crystal 
Night in ™3 9. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: So the y Œ they Œ she said, well I Œ if I™m expelled from 
France
, I can go see m y 
sister in 
Paris
, and she Œ she went to 
Pari s
, and then she came back, and then we 
changed attorne ys, and she appealed her expulsion. And she had a Œ now, a good 
attorne y, and she was acquitted by the Court of Appeals. But you can imagine, you 

go through this exercise, how Œ how Œ what that does take Œ 
takes out of you.
 
Q: Absolutely. 

A: So anyway Œ 

Q: You™re insecure to begin with, yeah. 

A: And thi s is, you know Œ and then of course on the political scene now, in ™38, th-
the Germans, the Nazis invaded 
Austria
, and t ook over 
Austria
, and in the spring of 
™39, the y invaded 
Czechoslovakia
, and took over 
Czechoslovaki a
, and everybody 

figured, you know, it™s going to go on.  
Q: I have a question at this point. You mention that your Œ your aunt was in

And m y question was, during these years t hat you are in 
France
, i n 
Marseilles

what™s goi ng on with the rest of the family that you™ve left behind? Have the y 

decided now that the y™re going to leave, or try to leave? Do the y sta y? What

but I don™t know anythi ng about them. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Tha-That was on my grandfather™s side of the family, that he was in business 

with. I don™t know what happened t o the business, whether it was sol d, or Œ I have 

no idea. And on my fat her™s side of the family, the y didn™t leave. I haven™t talked 
about them. My great-grandfather, in the mi d-1800s, established a compan y in

, which was a tobacco Œ particularl y cigars, ci gar manufacturer. Must 
have been a big deal, from everythi ng Œ if you go to

you about the cigar industry they used to have. But he established the thing, it was

became a next generati on director of the cigar company, and then one of his cousins. 
The two of them were t he heads of that, of the cigar industry in 
H ockenheim
. They 
Œ they Œ but 
Albert
 and his wife, 
Alfreida
(ph) did not leave. Then there was 

Alfreida
™
s 
sister, who was married to a younger brother of my uncle, my father. His 
name was 
Louie
, he was a bank president. See, the y all had gotten into their own 
fields, he was a bank president. They didn™t leave. The Œ there were quite a few of 

them. And I sa y this for a purpose. Because, after 
France
 fell, in June of 1940, the Œ 

some guy who wanted to Œ guy by the name of 
Wagner
(ph), who was in charge of 

the Œ for the Nazi party in 
Stuttgart
 wanted to mak
e 
Hitler
 believe that he was a 

genius. He invented the situation. You ma y read it differently in history books, but 

he Œ he told 
Hitler
, we got to get rid of Œ they say we got to get rid of the Jews. And 

so they organized a deal where all t he Jews of 
Baden 
Œ I don™t know about 
Württemberg
 Œ I mean, he wasn™t in 
Württemberg
 then, but 
Ba den
 and 
Pfalz
, 
which is 
Palatinate
 were ordered to be shipped out. The y were put on trains and 
shipped not east, but to 
France
, to the 
Gurs
 concentration camp, i n the 
Pyrenees
, in 
France
. And so my dad Œ we haven™t talked about that, but Œ 

Q: Oka y, we™ll Œ 

A: Œ m y dad, who wound up at 
G urs
 in t he fall of 1940, after he was there, 
trainloads of Œ of Œ of Jews from just about all the Jews who were still in 
Baden
 and 
Œ and 
Palatinate
, were put on these trains and shipped down to 
Gurs
, and he Œ so he

met  his brother and sist er-in-law, and the ot her sister-in-law, and t he niece, and old 
aunts, 84 years old, and the whole family wound up in this concentration camp in 

Gurs
 which Œ where the conditions were not Œ  they lived in barracks, and it was not 
very good. We™ll talk about 
Gurs
 later.  
Q: Yeah, we will. 
A: But that™s what  happened to them. Now Œ 
Q: So does that mean all 10 sibli ngs of your father Œ 

A: No, not 10, the y Œ you know, t he y, through the years the y got spread out. Let™s 
see, the oldest one was 
Albert
, so he Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ 
came t o 
Gurs
 wit h his wife. The next one was 
Karl
(ph); he had gone to the 
United States
 
before World WarI.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: He lived in Œ in 
Hollywood
, and wife and one daughter. And after that was 

Louie
,
 
the bank president. He died in ™38 of a heart attack, but had this wife and 

daughter who wound up in 
Gurs
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s number t hree that Œ then there were t hree sisters. 
Bella
 Œ 
Bella 
lived in 

Strasbou
rg
, 
France
. So she was Œ so, ot her circumstances. The strange thing in this 
family is t hat all three sisters married young, and were wi dowed young. Health si Œ

health services weren™t  as good then as the y are now, I guess. The second one, I 
don™t know when she left, 
Josephine
. She was married Œ the first husband died, she 
was married to a other gentleman by the name of 
Odenheimer
(ph), who lived in 
Baden
-
B a den
, and then she came to the 
United States
. So she made it out before 
France
 fell. And then t he young Œ younger one, the sister was 
Amali a
(ph), and 
she™s the one who married the gent leman in 
Switzerland
, that we went to sta y with. 
So she was in 
Switzerland
, so she was safe. In those da ys, th-the girl s, the sisters, 

had absolut ely not hing to say about what they did. It was the 
Albert Œ Albert 
in s 
Œ 
in lieu of parents that didn™t live, and probably 
Louie
 the bank president, because he 

had prestige, decided what the sisters would do, who the y would marry, or not 
marry,
 and i t was al l organized. It™s a different society. The Œ so that was 
Amalia
(ph), and then my dad was next. So that™s where they were. I saw Œ 
just a 
little side story Œ 
I saw 
Amalia
(ph), I used to, when I was stationed in 
Germany
, I 
went to visit her, after her husband Œ second husband died, and t hen she wound up in 
a Jewish ol d age home in the town of 
Baden
, which is near 
Zuri ch
. And, you know, 
she had thi s nice room, and so on. Nice place. It™s a Jewish old age home. And I Œ 

every ti me I went there, scared me to death, because she had a bed that was about  

this high. She was Œ

A: And I used to watch her get Œ get out of bed. I would sit there, and walk around 

and it scared me to death that she was going t o fall, break her hip or something. And 
I said to her Œ and we called her 
Mala

A: And just the mentalit y, the director, I went t o the director, he was very nice. And 
I said I Œ I™m scared to death my aunt™s going t o fall, she™s going to break her hip. 

And the Œ and the Œ I™d like to have a carpet installed, wall to wall carpet. And he 

looked at me Œ you never know what peopl e are gonna do Œ and he looked at me, 
and he said, but i-if or when your aunt dies, the carpet must remain here. And I sa Œ 
and I s Œ and I said to myself, you know, okay, I said, of course, I™ll be happy to 
leave it here. I mean, I™m going to come from 
Germany
, and take out  the carpet? A 
wall to wal l carpet? I mean Œ 
but t
hat™s the Œ 
the mentality. 
Darf 
man da s
. And 
everything i n her life, from the fact that the brothers decided everyt hing for the girls, 

in lieu of the parents, is alwa ys, is it permi tted, you know? And that it ™s just a Œ 
you 
have to understand that , you know, why people did the things that they Œ  they did, 

and th Œ and the people always ask the question, why didn™t the Jews revolt against 
Hitler
? And you know, it™s because that was the authority, and you did what the 
authority t old you. 

Q: Well, let  me turn that around in a pro Œ  more provocati ve way. If that is the Œ if 
that™s the mentality, then can one bl ame the German people so much t hat the y 

followed

conscience. And your conscience, that mean they Œ they rai se you, sa ying what™s 
right and what™s wrong. 

Q: Right. 

A: And when you get to a certain point, and certain things are done. Now, 
Hitler
 Œ 

Hitler
, one of the big t hings he used was the 
Versailles 
Treaty, and that Œ that 
Germany
 is only doing so badly because everyt hing was taken away from us, and 
he Œ he provoked nationalism, more nationalism, national ism. We are the poor Œ y-

you know. I mean, think about thi s, he sai d the Œ that, you know, we Œ we need more 

lebensraum
, we need more living space for the country. Well, but Œ but after the 

war, the 
B undesrepublik Deutschla nd
, without 
East Germany
, became the most 
powerful economic thi ng in the world, with the space that t he y had. So, you know, 

that Œ this stuff is all just to suit his Œ his purposes. He wanted Œ 
Q: Well, he was stoking resentment. 
A: Yeah, exactly. 

Q: He was stoking resent ment Œ 

A: That™s ri ght. He wanted to get the people t o Œ and Œ and Œ and Œ and Œ and tell 

them that we™re the t housand year

A: I mean, t here were good people in 
Germany
. They™re good Œ 
you know,it™s just 
like we talk about 
France
.  Some 
Œ some of the police guys were bad, some of the 
neighbors were questionable, but t here were an awful lot of good people. I mean, I 
could tell you the story that, when we lived in 
Marseilles
, the 
Œ the guy that owned 
our apart ment, I don™t know how many months he didn™t get pai d rent. He never said 
Œ never said a word. He knew who we were, and that Œ what the circumstances were. 
And I suspect we™ll get to how we got out  of 
France
 later. 

Q: Oh, a-absolutely. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Absolutely. 

A: I™ll tell you a st ory about one of our nei ghbors which is moving to the end, I

Q: I know. It is Œ 
si mply is 
Œ isn™t  it a Œ I guess the Œ one of the things that one 
should never do is ask a leading question. And here I am, and I™m going to ask a 
leading question, and t hat Œ and it™s just t o go on this theme a litt le more. Isn™t it 

more 
Œ isn™t it easier to sell this bill of goods t hat you described, to a populous that is 

raised not j ust to know what is right from wrong, but to ask for permi ssion at every 

step of the wa y, of may I do this, may I not do this? And who are t he authorities? 

Versus a population that believes i n 
égalité
, 
fraternité
, and Œ and 
li berté
? You 
know, a population that  is also guaranteed, as in the 
United States
, a constitution of

freedom of expression, and freedom after expression, you know? Freed
om o f 
Speech, in other words. I Œ it™s just Œ 

A: So your questi on is, is it easier t o do it t he way the Germans di d it ? 

Q: No. Is it easier t o do it to a population which has a value in it t hat you have to ask 

permission for everythi ng that you do in your life? In other words, that you accept 
authority easier, than in countries where authority is Œ it™s oka y t o question it. 
A: Well, the Germans Œ I™m trying to figure out how to answer t hat. The Germans 

are by custom Œ not probably so much toda y, but were then, a people who only 

operated by authority. I Œ I like to sa y in 1945,  when I was in 
Paris
, and this is t he 

difference between I Œ you know, the French have poli Œ political cabarets, and you 

can hear stuff that you don™t hear anywhere el se. But m y saying then was, the 

difference between a Frenchman and a German is that a German i s on a Metro i n 
Paris
, and he has trouble coughing. He needs to cough and to expectorate, and the 
sign says, in the subway, 
défense
 
de cracher
. Spitting prohibited. And so the 
Ger man wil l stand there and go Œ and pract ically strangle. The Frenchman will come 

along, and he says Œ and he looks at the si gn that sa ys,

A: Like Americans are different from themsel ves. The northern French are very 

cold, the southern French are very, ah, 
laissez a

Q: Live and let live, huh? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: It™s an i nteresting example. Can we cut for just a second?

So you 
Œ 
you™ve kind of described to me that many of your father™s relatives who were still in 
Germany
, got to 
Gurs 
Œ 
were transported t o 
Gurs Œ
 deported to 
Gurs
. Can you tell 
me what their fates were? Did all of them make it out of 
Gurs
, or did some of them 
not?  

A: Both. No, that can™t be both. Some of them made, and some didn™t. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And some died there. My father™s oldest brother, 
Albert
, and his wife
 
Alfreida
(ph) 
Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ made i t out. Their son lived i n 
Los Angeles
, and he was able Œ I don™t know the 

details, but  he was able to get them out, after we were gone. That™s why I don™t 

know the details. His Œ as I told you, 
Albert
™
s 
wife 
Alfreida

to his brot her 
Louie

Q: Heart attack, I thi nk you said.  
A: Yeah, that™s what the records sa y. I had heard that he Œ the Gestapo came to arrest 

hi m, and he had a heart  attack. So, whether it was this wa y, or that way, but he was a 

very formal man, what I knew of hi m. He would not open a door without having 

gloves on. Kid gl oves, you know, suede gloves. 
Q: Wow.
 
A: Door handles had germs on them. He died in ™38, and his widow, 
Clara
, and her 
daughter 
Annie
(ph), who™s m y first cousin, were shipped to 
Gurs
, together with a 
group. Then there were a couple of old aunts, couple of whom di ed i n 
Gurs
. The 
conditions in 
Gurs
 were not like i n 
Auschwitz
 or Œ or 
Dachau
, but they Œ they were 
not good. You were, quite basically, exposed t o the elements, livi ng in these Œ in Œ in 

Œ in barracks. She was still there. She was there throughout ™42. 
Q: 
Annie
(ph), or Œ or Œ  or Œ  
A: Both the mother and daughter, 
Clara
 and 
Annie
(ph) were there. There™s quite an 
exchange, some of whi ch I owe to this gentleman here, of correspondence that he got 
from the Quakers, and we™ll get to that. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But where the Œ where she, in ™42, was asking for mone y, because she had no 

money, and Œ and so on. So, I believe Œ I™ve got the date, I believe it was August of 
™42, that we got a postcard from her, 
Clara
. We™re being loaded on a t rain, we do

not know where to. And that™s the last we ever heard of her. Both she and Œ and 
Annie
(ph) got gassed in 
Auschwitz
, and Œ 
[sound of plane] 
Unfortunately, we™re on 
the pattern for 
Love Field
.  
Q: Oka y. So they were shipped to 
Auschwitz
. 
A: So the y Œ 
they were shippedto au
-aus-aus Œ 
Auschwitz
. I have in t he documents, 
which I have for 
Ron
, one of my cousins sent a letter in ™45, sent a letter to 
Gurs
, 
when it was Œ there was still an administration there, and asked what happened to 
them, and I have the letter from them that says what train the y were shipped off on. 

Didn™t sa y to 
Auschwitz
, but Œ  
Q: And just for the camera, for clarification, you™re talking about correspondence 

that you got from m y colleague, 
Ron Coleman
, at the 
United States
 
Holocaust 
Memorial Museum
, t o augment what you already knew? 
A: No, that correspondence I got from the famil y archives. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: That part icular one. But the Œ 
th
-the y have Œ th-the y have the la yout Œ you have 
the la yout at the Holocaust Museum, whi ch even gives the dates, and so on. 

Q: Right. So that Œ those relatives didn™t ma
ke it.
 
A: The y di d Œ they didn™t make it. Then some died there. There was an Aunt 

So phie
(ph) that was in her 80s when she Œ she™s buried there. 
Caroline 
and I went 
to 
Gurs
 about 10 years ago, and there™s not  much left of it, but the cemetery is there.

The people five miles from there, t he y don™t know what 
Gurs 
was, which is alwa ys 
pathetic. But there i s a monument  there wi th a train car, to remember. And the 
cemetery is there. Whi ch is a point of interest. The city of 
Karlsruhe
 sends students 
to 
Gurs
 
every 
summer, to take care of the cemetery, which should be noted as a 
statement of Œ 
Q: Not forgetting. 
A: Œ solidarity, or what ever.  

Q: Or not forgetting. 

A: Or not forgetting. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. They didn™t have to do it , but they™re doing it. 
Karlsruhe
 
is ve
ry, very pro 
remembering the past, and all the bad things that were done. The y™re very nice. 
Q: Let™s turn back now to your family, and your immediate family in 
Marseilles
, 
and your father is released, and your mother is tried and found guilty, and then gets 
another lawyer, and is acquitted. This must have taken a psychological toll on 

everybody. 

A: Yes. The kids Œ also on the kids, but kids tend to be engaged in the daily activi ties 

and so on. It obviously was very hard, but as t hey say in German, if we™re adults, 
es 

bleibtin ihren kno chen
. It remains in their bones. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

A: The kids, if something had happened, it ™s not quite the same. 
Q: More resilient, i n some ways. 

A: Yeah. Well, and they don™t have any responsibility, you know, whereas the adults 

have responsibility for everybody. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: He Œ he was released, 
Mother was 
Œ so that  was, obvi ously in Œ in ™38 someti mes, 
I can™t tell you when. 
Q: What happened after that? How did life progress? 

A: Oka y, so parallel to all this, the Œ the Germans, N
azis, occupied 
Œ took over 
Austria
. Then in the beginning of ™39, 
Czechoslovakia
. And on the first of 
September, ™39 
Œ I™m l aughing for a purpose, but they invaded 
Poland
. After the y 
had had non-aggression pacts with the Soviets, and what ever. On the third of 
September, 
France
 and 
England
 declared war on 
Germany
, and that was the 
beginning of Worl d War II. Immediately when the war st arted, my dad, as 
now an 
enemy alien, was arrest Œ arrested. Interned, is ma ybe a bet ter word. Sent to 
les 

Mill
es
, which was a 
camp near 
Marseilles
, in 
Aix -
en
-Provence
, which is near 
Marseilles
. And the y collected all the people they didn™t know where the y fit in, and 

what did Œ who had a background from Œ 
at  
Œ now, at this point, this was a French 
action, nothing to do with the Germans. 
Q: So he™s a German, and Germans are now our enemies, and so therefore. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

A: That™s ri ght. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And so this cu Œ camp in 
Les Milles
 Œ you know how to spel l it, I™m sure. 
Q: 
M-i-l-l-e
?  

A: No, 
M-i -l-l-e-s
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: 
Les
 in front of it, 
l-e-s
. It was a brick factory that they converted into a Œ I guess 

they ran out  of what to do Œ the y didn™t have any more bricks to make, so the y used 

it for this, and they made it internment camp. And this was the craziest assembly of 

people that you ever heard in your life, because there were a lot of people who had 

left 
Germany
, prominent people who had left 
Germany
, who li ved i n 
France
, and 
the y™re the ones who wound up in 
Les Milles
. That included 
Marc Chagall
; that 
included 
L ion Feuchtwanger
, the famous author; that included 
Nobel
 prize 
physicist 
Meyerhof
, and I could go on. 
Q: Enemy aliens, in ot her words.  
A: The y were enem y aliens. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So the y Œ they had this very strange Œ I read yesterda y somewhere, that one of 

them was a famous surgeon from 
Vien
na
, he came with his two Œ he had two 
attendants, two 
Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
76
 
Q: Assistants? 
A: Œ people that did things for hi m, you know? Household Œ he brought them al ong, 

you know? The y weren™t Jewish or anythi ng, they were just Œ were hi s Œ his 

employees. So they Œ 
t hey ha
d them all there, and the y di dn™t know what to do with 

them. It was not super- dangerous, there were all kinds of outside contacts, but it was 
Œ but there was a fence around, and Œ and the conditions were not  very good. 
Hygiene, food, stuff like that. And m
y d ad 
Œ that was in Œ in Sept ember, after the 
war started. By December of Œ of ™39, he got out of there. He had friends in 

Marseilles
, which was nearby, that vouched for him, that he was a good guy, and so 

they let him out. Some others never got out, but they let hi m out. And so, he was 

home in 
Marseilles
 wit h us, until Ma y of ™40. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: In Ma y of ™40, the Germans, as you know, invaded 
Holland
,
 Belgium
, 
Luxembourg
, came into northern 
France
 and in Œ in Œ i n Œ in t wo weeks, reached 
Paris
, and t ook 
Paris
. And the French arm y was nowhere to be seen. I don™t know 
whether that™s true, but that™s what it seemed l ike, because nobody stopped them. 

Charles de Gaulle 
would have sai d, well, the Germans had tanks, and we didn™t. 

And that was true. And so the y just kept going. So then the quest ion came for us Œ I 

mean, the people from 
Paris
, and so on, north, extreme south on t he highwa ys of 
France
, and we were i n 
Marseilles
, and so then the authorities in 
Marseilles
 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
77
 
decided he y, what™s going to happen. And so t hey Œ as one of the first things the y 
did, is the y took t hese people like m y dad, and they put them back in 
Les Milles
. So 
some were, probably at  the end of May, I don™t have the exact date, m y dad was 

back in 
Les Milles
, where they had left Œ you know, ha Œ  they had let them go. 

Q: But there™s somethi ng Œ there™s something that™s really surreal about this, because 
the point of being i n 
L es Milles
 is if you were an enem y, and that means if you™re a 
German who would support 
Germany
, and the people that you mentioned, were not 
those types of people. 

A: Yeah, but the French couldn™t t ell the difference, and there were people in 
Les 

Milles
 who were not Jewish, quite a few. 

Q: And were there some who actual ly were?  

A: There were oc Œ an occasional Nazi in t here, too. 
Q: Yeah, that™s one wa Œ 
A: Not by design, but by happenstance, because there were some Nazi s who were 

living in 
France
, j ust li ke everybody else. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so the y picked up everybody that was German, Austrian, Czech, and the y Œ 

if they didn™t know Œ you know. By this ti me, there were thousands of refugees in 
Marseilles
, because everybody from up north came down. There were hotels that Œ 
the French police had police raids every da y in downtown 
Marsei lles
, to find people 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

who were here illegally. And so t here Œ the stories are endless. But they were back in 
Les Milles
, and the Germans ca Œ were coming south. And so, t here wasn™t much 

time between the 20
th
 of May, you know, and so Œ so, about Œ and there, it™s a litt le 
vague, the date is not quite sure. Let™s Œ the book on 
Les Milles
 sa ys about the 20
th
 
of May, I Œ of June Œ I don™t believe it, it™s Œ had to be a few da ys earl ier, it just 
doesn™t fit Œ they t ook Œ not everybody, but they took all the volunteers in 
Les 
Milles
 who felt threatened by the Nazis, and i s Œ and the Œ the comm an Œ 

commandant of 
Les Milles
, who had some good sides to hi m. He was a reserve 

officer, that the arm y wasn™t his thing, and he was running this camp, and he also 

had a Œ a conscience, and so he decided to use his personal influence, and he Œ he 

called up somebody he knew, and he Œ I just read that in a book, I didn™t know how 

that worked. He call ed him up, and says, I w Œ I need a train. And so they produced a 
train for hi m, and said, anybody who want s Œ who Œ who feels threat ened, we™ll take 
you away so the Germans can™t get at you. So they loaded all these guys Œ  

Q: The 
Nobel
 prize wi nners, the Œ 
A: Everybody. 
Li on Feuchtwanger
, and 
Hans
(ph) 
Klay
(ph), the famous artist , and 
I mean, there were dozens of them. The y loaded them on this trai n, unless they 

refused. Didn™t have to go on the train. But the train was t he purpose of escaping the 

Germans. And they Œ t hey put them on this train, and the y headed west, towards the 
Pyrenees
, and basicall y t owards t he 
Atlantic
. 
Bordeaux
, 
Bayonne
 Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: Was your father on this train? 
A: My father was on this train, and I don™t  know, you know, he Œ you could visualize 

that he coul d have said to himself, oh, but  m y family is in 
Marseil les
, why do I want 

to be on this train? Because the y said it Œ 
t he y said 
they were going to take hi m to 
North
 
Afri ca
, where they would be safe. I don™t know when the y sai d that, but the y 
said that somewhere along the line. And so the train took off, and the captain Œ I 
mean, the commandant  of the ca Œ of 
Les Milles
, kept track of the train, to be sure Œ 

yeah, then he called Œ t hey he called Œ like, thi s is new informati on for me, but he 

called a cousin of his, who owned the boat Œ t he ship, in 
Bayonne
, on the 
Atlantic
 
coast, and he said hey, I need you. I Œ 
you gott
a be in 
Bayonne
, I have got a 
thousand Œ  
Idon™t knowwhatthe number exactl y was 
Œ of Œ of refugees here, I got 
to get to 
N orth
 
Africa
. Well, how much are you gonna pa y me? Well, 500 francs, or 
whatever it was, a head. Oka y. So, the y put him on a train, and the train took off. 
And he kept track of it, because the guy in 
Bayo nne
 said, m y ship will only be here 
until such and such a date. The y gotta get here. So he kept working over the railroad 

official, so the train would keep moving, while the Germans were comi ng sout h. 

And so m y guess is, on the 19
th
, I Œ  you know, I™m a little vague on that, but on t he 
19
th
 of June, we got  phone call. We Œ m y mot her got a phone call from the Fr-French 
police, and the y sai d, oh you gotta evacuate. Be Œ be at the train station at six o™cl ock 
in the morning.

Gare
 
Sai nt Charles

Saint
 
Charles 
train station at six 
o™clock in t he morning, we™re gon Œ we™re going to take you awa y, take you out of 

danger. So, oka y, so we pack our bags, and you don™t know that you™re ever going to 

come back, so we took clothing and food, cause you don™t  know whether there is any 
food. Well, then it happened that t hat night Œ and you can Œ we coul d figure out what 
the date was, because that night i n southern 
France
 was the heaviest thunderstorm I 
have ever lived through anywhere. I mean, you thought the worl d was coming to an 

end. And we thought at  the ti me it was caused by the artillery, that the artillery fire 

in northern 
France
 had caused so much di sruption of the Œ of the atmosphere, that it 
screwed up the weat her. And anywa y, it poured, and thundered, and li ghtning, I 

mean  
Œ and there was no means of transportation. You couldn™t get a c-cab or 
anyt hing. Nothing moved.
 
Q: So you have this mandatory order that you have to be at  this Œ 

A: At the train stati on. 

Q: Oka y.  

A: And so, we first Œ first we headed out, carryi ng suitcases, on foot. My house, 

withoutsuitcases, was probably45 minut
es to an hour, by foot, to the train station. 
Q: Oka y. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: And so we wal ked a little bit in this thunderstorm. We decided t hat wa Œ we Œ we 
had to let the storm go by, there was no wa y we could keep going. 

Q: Right. 

A: And so we went back home. And then I went next door to m y friend 
George
(ph)
 

Garrute
(ph), the C atholic kid who went to mass at five o™clock i n the morning, that 
I told you about. He was a couple of years older than I was. And I said, 
George
(ph), 
I need you. He sa ys, sure. I said, you gotta hel p me carry suitcases. Okay. So my 

mother and my sister went ahead, be sure to make Œ to be t here on ti me when this 

was supposed to happen, and Œ and 
George 
and I carried the suitcases. And we had 

to stop every 20 feet, because we Œ 

Q: Weren™t you soaking wet?  

A: Well, that Œ the storm wasn™t t hat bad any more. That was the first install ment. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: By this time it wasn™t pouring any more.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: And so we Œ 
we 
Œ somewhere we decided that we had too many suitcases, we 

took a couple back to t he house, and went wit h the rest of them. And we carried 

them to the train station. It took us more than an hour to get to the train station. 

Couple hours, I™m sure. We finall y got Œ at  dawn, we got to the front of the train 
station, and then we were told, oh, you got to go to the back of the trai n station. We 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

had a pretty big trai n station. So, there was a cab there. So I took the cab, and I said, 
oka y, m y motherhas mone y,I™ll 
Œ we™ll pay for the cab when we get  there. And so 
we put everyt hing i n the cab, and we went around to the back. When we got there, 

m y mother was hysterical, because I hadn™t shown up, and she di dn™t want to leave 

with me 
Œ without  me. And so she finall y saw me, and she Œ she j ust Œ I can tell you 
that the trai n left about 15 minutes after I got to the back of the Œ of the train stat ion. 

And wi Œ it was one of these Œ many miracl es I™ve experienced in m y life, this one of 

them. And so the t rain l eft. And the train went Œ there were all women and children, 

there were no men on t his. And this, 
yo u 
Œ you know, I have to say, you were a man 
if you were over 18. Well, I wasn™t , I was 14. So I was a child. And we Œ the trai n 

went, and t here was a Œ it was a passenger t rai n, with compartments. We were in a 

compart ment, the three of us, with two ladies that we knew well, a m other and Œ 
mother and daughter, who was about m y mother™s age. 
Q: Were these also German Jews? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. Whose Œ the younger one, her name Œ they were, Mrs. 
Jacob

the Œ the mother, the old mother, she 
was probablyinher 70s,her name was 

Devries

Devries

Devries

Mrs.

ster and I in this 
compart ment. And Œ and we went and stopped, and went and stopped, and this Œ 
you 
know, you 
Œ the Germans were coming south. Nothing worked. I mean, it was a 
miracle 
Œ 
Q: And you didn™t  know where Œ did you know where you were going? Was there 
any idea 
Œ 
A: No, the only thing we knew, we were going west. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And the Œ we went t o Œ wound up in 
Toulouse
, and then after 
Toulouse
, 
whatever the next Œ 
Niemes
. And Œ and Œ and then we wound up, and we Œ we 
stopped in 
Lo urdes
. And 
Lourdes
 is well-known internationally, because of the 
Catholic shrine there. And so we are parked i n Œ on the tracks. And by this time, it™s 
approxi mately the 20 Œ either the 21
st
, or 22
nd
 of June. And we™re sitti ng there for a 
while. We had gendarmes on board who were supposedly watching us, or taking 
care of us, or whatever the y Œ 

Q: Could you leave the train at all? Could you go on the platform, as you were Œ 

A: In princi ple not, but if I™d gone on the platform, nobody woul d have said

A: Œ reason, because you didn™t know whether the train was going to leave in the 

next minut e.
 

Q: Oka y. 

A: We didn™t know anything. Neither did t he gendarmes. And so we were there Œ I 
know we were there four or five hours. And Œ and there was a Œ let™s see, we were 
on this track here, and there™s a track here, and the platform between us. And the Œ 

there™s a train parked here, that™s a freight train. And I™ll Œ I™ll swear to my dying 

day, it was a freight train, it was not a passenger train. And after a few hours, t here™s 

a woman on our train, who looked at the freight train, and saw her husband. And this 

train, the pas Œ freight t rain, is what in history has gos Œ gone down as the phant om 

train. Th-There are books written about the phantom train, I got a movie, and a Œ and 
a 
Œ books about it, what the phant om train was all about. And that was the phant om 
train. And after this woman discovered her husband, we all looked out, and got out, 

and m y dad was on that train. 

Q: So that was the train that was from

it. And we just looked at it, and the y™ve got a passenger train here. And it was not a

say 
Œ 
you know,I thou
ght that when it got to i ts end that they Œ t he people got off, 
and then the ship wasn™t there, and then the y put them on a different train. But I have 

no Œ nothi ng in writ Œ written record I have found that Œ that sa ys that.  
Q: So did your father see you? 

A: Yeah, we Œ we Œ 

Q: Did you see Œ 
did you 
Œ did he get off of his phantom train, or not ? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you met on the platform? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you join each ot her then?  

A: Yeah Œ well Œ 

Q: I mean, could he leave Œ 

A: Œ we tal ked to each other. We talked to each other for a few hours. 
Q: So was he Œ di d he Œ

train.

Q: So, did you then joi n each other afterwards, or did you each go back to your 
separate trains? 

A: 
The y mad
e us go back on our separate train, and the y Œ and the y said e Œ well, 

what you have to understand is about this ti me, 22
nd
 of June, 19 Œ 
Q: Forty. 
A: Œ 40, the word came out that 
France
 had si gned an armistice, and the war was 
over. 

Q: For them. 

A: That the war bet ween 
Germany
 and 
France
 
wasover. Now,what that meant, 
nobody could tell, at that point. And so, they Œ they Œ I doubt that they had orders, 

the guys in charge of these trains. It  just what you do when you have to make a 

decision. So the gendarmes made us go back on our train, and they Œ t he Œ the 
guards, th-t he soldiers on the other train made them get back on t heir train, a-and 

said, and I quote, ﬁWel l, don™t worry. The war is over. You™ll Œ 
your husbands will 
soon be home.ﬂ And they Œ and so that train left, and we left. We went back to 

Marseilles
. We went back home. So we were only gone a week, I Œ give or take, I 

don™t know exactly, but so Œ and so, we went home. And this train didn™t go home. 

The y went t o Œ 
the y stoppedthem in 
Œ in 
Nî mes
, which is a city on the wa y, and 
they unloaded them, and the y established a camp called 
Saint Nicolas
,
 Saint 
Nicolas
, and the y put t hem in there. Well, t hat  was a very poorly prepared camp, and 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

so he was i n 
Saint Nicolas
, this was June, end of June. He was, I think, in 
Saint 
Nicolas
 July and August. And then somewhere in there, I would sa y August, ma ybe 

the first of September, the y decided to move t he people from 
Sai nt Nic
olas
 to
 
Gurs
.  
Q: Oh, is t hat how he ended up in 
Gurs
?  
A: That™s how he ended up in 
G urs
. Now to t he history of 
Gurs
 is that 
Gurs
 was 
established in 1936, to bring in the refugees from the Spanish ci vil war. And so the Œ 

there probably were sti ll some refugees of the Spanish civil war i n 
Gurs
 when t he 
Germans arrived. And Œ and m y father and his cohorts Œ 
Q: The other enemy aliens, yes. 

A: Yeah, the enemy aliens. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And so, that™s how he wound up at 
G urs
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: And Œ and then, that was in sep Œ 
let™s say September, andon the 
Œ I believe i t 

was the second Œ 
22
nd
 of October that the 
Gauleiter
 of Œ of 
Württemberg
 and 
Ba den 
and whatever, decided to send all the Jews from 
Germany
 down there. And 
so that was the end of October that  the people from 
Germany
 got there. 
Q: In all this ti me, I mean it sounds that it ™s Œ i t Œ it was almost a n Œ not necessarily 

an ending, but a constant stream of insecurity for your parents, of registering with 
the police, not knowing whether or not their Œ t heir resident s™ permit would be

extended. Even after several years being in 
Marseilles
, still being considered enemy 
aliens, of being picked up, let go, picked up, let go, on a train, not  on a train, but Œ 
out of home, back t o home. How did you have, I mean, not only the nerves that are Œ 

are involved here, how did you eat? I mean, how were able to make m one y, how 

were you able to make a li Œ how were the y able to make a living? 
A: It™s Œ that™s not  a question that m y sister and I can answer. We don™t know, 
because we were chil dren, and we were prot ected. I know that m y parents sold 

furniture and items from t heir Œ t he household at auctions, when t he y ran out of 

money. That much I know. Where t he mone y came from t o feed us, I have no idea. I 

know we didn™t get  any mone y from relatives anywhere el se. As a m atter of fact, if 

anyt hing, we gave money t o people, members of the family who were in 

concentration camps. You know, my dad did an occasional business deal. My 
mother, when the war started, knitted 
genouill ère
. 
Q: What™s t hat? 

A: That™s a thing t hat Œ knitted woolen thi ngs t hat soldiers wear
 
on the Œ on Œ 
ge
no u
 
is the knee Œ wear on t heir legs to keep them warm in the front lines. She worked for 

the war effort. But you don™t make any mone y at that, you know. Somehow, to her 

great credit, she Œ somehow she scraped by. We Œ we don™t know how. We Œ t here™s 

no wa y we can figure it out. We know that our landlord di dn™t push us if we couldn™t 
pay the rent. But we at e, and Œ and then this period when m y dad was there, before Œ

between 
Les Milles
 and 
Les Mill es
, you know, he came home one day and said, oh, 
you know, there was Œ there was no food in 
France
. I mean, forget about us, there 
was no food. The only thing the y sold in the Œ in the Œ in the grocery store were 

rutabagas. If you present me with a rutabaga, I™ll kick you out of the house. 

Q: You™ve Œ you™ve had your fill? 
A: That™s Œ  that™s all there was. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And the Œ so that Œ I don™t know how we Œ how we lived. On t he other hand, m y 

friends, my French friends, never quit bei ng my French friends. And m y sister™s 

French friends, she was Œ she has French friends from her school that  she Œ 
that she 

calls on the telephone once a month to this day. 

Q: To this da y, wow. 
A: And the y™re all Œ my sister is now 91, going on 92, and the y™ve always been our 
friends. We grew up wi th them. The y Œ the y never said to us, you are a dirty 

German, or something. The y were our friends. And I™ll tel l you t hat in a minute, how 

Œ to what Œ  how that works. But anywa y, he was in 
Gurs
, and we were here. Now, 
September 19 
Œ thi s is i mportant, because without this, I wouldn™t be sitting here. In 
September of 1940, school started. And you know, so I go to school, and she goes to 

school. That™s the plan. And so I got to school, and the y called me i nto the deputy 
director of the school, with m y mother, and they said, oh, you can™t come bac
k. And 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

m y mother said 
Œ you know, I was probably afraid of the guy Œ m y mother said, why 
not? Well, we Œ you™re German. Your son is a German, and 
Germany
 has beaten 
France
, has defeated 
France
, and t he other kids, who will know that you are 
German, will Œ will Œ will Œ will beat you up. 

Q: He just didn™t want you there? 
A: Ma ybe he believed it, I don™t know. And I said, I know, I said to hi m, 
nobody is 
going to beat me up. Al l m y classmates are m y friends. That Œ just the wa y it was. 
We been together for four or five years, and you know, I knew every one of them. 

The y™re all dead now, but I Œ if I walked down the street, the y would embrace me. 

And Œ but he wouldn™t relent. Oka y. So now, my sister™s going to school, and that™s 

why I sa y Œ 

Q: And she doesn™t have the problem? 
A: Oh no, there were Œ m y sister never has any problems. It™s alwa ys me, because 
I™m a boy. Girls get  treated Œ 
Caroline
 doesn™t believe it, but I can guarantee you 

that boys got treated di fferentl y from girls. And so Mother takes t he position, well, 

he™s 14 years old, Dad is in a camp, 14 year ol ds tend to get in trouble. Now, my 

mother didn™t know my very well, because that was not something I knew how to 

do. That wasn™t part of m y scenario. But anyway, so she Œ Mother had an 

unbelievabl e social conscience, and did Œ 
you 
know, what this woman did is wa y 
beyond anyt hing you can ever think of. And so she Œ she decided, first of all, she Œ

we now knew that Dad was in Œ in Œ in the camp Œ 
yeah, hewas probablyalready at 
Gurs
. It was September. 
Q: Is Œ is Œ geographicall y, is 
Gurs
 far from 
Marseilles
?  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: It™s at the foot of Œ foot of the 
Pyrenees
, near the 
Atlantic
.  
Q: Ah, o
k a y.
 
A: Do we have a map of that, 
Caroline
, if we can show where it i s? 
Q: It™s oka y. It™s just I wanted to get Œ 

A: Yeah. Now, it™s Œ 

Q: Œ m y next question would be, were you ever able to visit him? 
A: No. 
Q: Oka y. So, correspondence only. Letters onl y. 
A: Correspondence only. And so, but Mother t ried to see how to get him out. You 

alwa ys Œ there was always  a possibility you could get somebody out. You could get 

hi m out, if you could get hi m a vi sa to the 
Uni ted States
. And so she was doing the 
tour of the relief agencies, of which everything had come to 
Marseilles
. 
Marseilles
 

was the cent er, the fulcrum of Œ of everything now, because all the refugees all Œ 

everything had come down to this place. And so all of the relief agencies, the Œ the 
Quakers, the Œ the 
OSE
, 
Office de Secours Enfants
, the 
Œ the Œ they t ook care of

kids, and the American Mennonite committee, the Unitarian committ ee, they were Œ 
and then some non-American outfits, but t he y were all in 
Marseilles
. 
Q: Now is Œ at thi s poi nt, was the 
Pétain
 government already established? 
A: It got established in June of Œ 

Q: 1940. 
A: Œ ™40. 
Q: So this would have been four months later. Four or five months later, yeah. 
A: Three. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, July, August, September, three months. Was September. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Definitely September. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And yeah, the y Œ they were there. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: For whatever good they did. And there were some people on t hat Œ in the cabinet 

of 
Pétain 
that were 
foo
, right wing fanatics. They worked with the Germans, the y 
loved the Germans. So anyway Œ so Mother went, and took me al ong, to go to the 

relief agencies, to see how Œ what to do about Dad. And we had an application. I 
don™t know when i t went in, but we had an application for visas in the unite Œ to the

United States
, and you have to supply affidavits from relat ives, that you don™t 
become a burden to the 
U
.
S
. government, etce
t era, etcetera.
 
Q: So at some point, the conversati on had changed. You mentioned earlier than 

when your parents movedto 
Marseilles
, it was with the i dea that that ™s not so far, 
we could go back at  some point. 
A: Yeah, well Œ 
Q: And at some point, that changed. 

A: Yeah, because the Germans went to war. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The minute the Germans declared war on Œ on Œ on t he rest of 
E uro pe
, to t ake 
over the world, that was passé, you know Œ 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ that wasn™t Œ didn™t exist any more. The first place we went to, were the 
American Quakers, the Americans™ Friends™ Service Committee. They had an office 

on 
Boulevard d™Athènes
, 29. The train station, 
Gare Sai nt Charles
 that I told you 

about, was sitting on top of the hill, and it Œ you could come straight down from 
there. The Œ some steps, and then t here was 
Boulevard d™Athènes
, Boulevard of 
Athens
. And number 20 Œ on the Œ on the right hand side there was first the 
Hotel 
Splendi de
, and then thi s building 29, where the Quakers took over the floor. And so 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
94
 
we went to 29 
Boulevard d™Athènes
, on the second floor, and there was a 
receptionist , and Œ 

Q: Did you speak Engli sh? 

A: Well, ah, you caught me. I Œ the last two years in school, in lycée, I had taken 

English, and I had the first marks in Engli sh, both years. And well , it was easier for 
me, because I knew German, and you know, once you go languages, you Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But, so I knew some English. I know Œ knew more English than ki ds who go to 

American high school and take two years of anything. My Engl ish was better than 

that. It wasn™t good, far from it. So we got there, and th Œ rang the doorbell, and this 

lady, whose name I have to look up, because I knew it so well, opened the door, and 

she was the receptionist sitting in the lobby there. And we told her what we want ed, 
and we got to speak to a representative, and tell hi m the story, etcetera, etcetera, and 
we went awa y. Mot her observed that this was a total f Œ fallacy, this whole thing. 

That here you have have only the clients, only spoke no French, they all spoke 

German Œ most of them. Some of them spoke some eastern European languages, but 

mostly German. 

Q: German. 

A: And the receptionist  doesn™t speak anyt hing except French. 
Q: Was she American? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
95
 
A: No, no, she was French. 
Q: She was French. 

A: Was a local hire. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And so Mother thought this over, not very l ong, and sh Œ 
we went back,and 
Mother offered my services as an i nterpreter. Volunteer. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: I had nothing t o do. She wanted to Œ the whole purpose was to get me to do 

something, because Œ 

Q: To keep you off the streets. 

A: Keep me off the streets, exactly. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And the y accepted me. 
Q: As a volunteer because you spoke languages? 

A: Yeah. I could speak German. Anybody that walked in t he door, that came for 

help, I coul d ask them in German, what do you want? And I spoke French, I could 

tell the lady there, t hat™s what the y want. And I spoke some Engl ish, so I could 

interrelate with the Quakers, who were very nice people.

Q: All right, let™s pause here just for a second, to get a sense of the la y of the land. 
Can you describe t he building for me, what it looked like? You said i t was on the 

second floor. 

A: Yeah, was a big, old, well-built  Œ 

Q: Stone?  
A: Œ stone apart ment house, basically. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: But the y had offices. Ma ybe Œ I don™t know how long they had offices, they Œ 

ma ybe the y had alwa ys offices down below, but it was really an apart ment house. 

And the reason I mention that it was next door to the the 
Hotel Splendide
 is because 
the Germans made t he 
Hotel Splendide
 the headqu
arters of 
the armi stice 
commission. So every day, when I went to work for the Quakers, I had to go by 
these damn cars, wi th swastika flags on. And which di Œ scary enough. And also 
because 
Œ and this i s way off from what we™re talking about, but there™s a guy by the 

name of 
Varian Fry
 that you might be familiar with.
 Varian Fry 
came into 
Œ i nto
 
Marseilles
, and made hisheadquartersin the 
Splendi de
.  
Q: As well?  

A: As well .
 Varian Fry 
was sent over by 
Eleanor Roosevelt
 
to rescue
 
a few 
hundred people like the ones I described to you before. 
Nobel 
prize winners, famous

international painters, artists, engineers, poets, writers, musicians. And that was 
Varian Fry
™
s
 task.  
Q: And the surgeon with his two assistants?  

A: I don™t know where he fit in. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Ma ybe t he surgeon would have made it, but not the assistants. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: See, he had nobody to polish his shoes any more. But
 Varian Fry
 was there for a 
while, but then he Œ he Œ he was advised to get  out of there because the Nazis would 

figure out who he i s, and that Œ that would not be good.  

Q: Did you meet hi m at the ti me? Did you know who he was?  

A: I™ve met 
Varian Fry
, but you know, I was a 15 year ol d boy, I™ve met  him 
because he came to our office, which was t he headquarters of the Quakers, for the 

whole 
Euro pe
. And the Œ 
Q: For all of 
Euro pe
?  
A: Yeah, the y Œ well, t hey got kicked out of 
Paris
, the y got kicked out of 
Spain
, 
Marseilles
 was the only place left. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And I could ri Œ I could tell you about t he Quakers for days. They Œ the kind of 
people the y were, the Œ unbelievable people.  

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: I would like to hear about it. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: But first, let™s talk about 
Varian Fry
. 
A: So, we Œ 

Q: He came to your offices? 
A: Well, he just came t o visit. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And I, you know, I knew he was 
Varian Fry
. I did not know what his mission 
was. I knew that he worked with us, but I didn™t know that he was charged by the 

U
.
S
. government, of rescuing famous people. And then he took an office somewhere 

in 
[indecipherable]
. The rest is about 
Varian Fry
™
s 
history. But Œ but that™s Œ 
you 
have to understand how this layout worked. The 
Splendide
, with the Germans here, 
and we were in the buil ding next door, 29 
Boulevard d
™
Athènes
. So, anyway Œ so I 
worked there initially, as the interpreter. And then the y got to know me, and I got to 

know them, and Œ but you have to keep in mind, I was 14 years ol d. I keep telling 

m y grandki ds, who are 25, don™t know how to get their finger out of their ear, what 

you can do at 14, if you have to, you know. It™s Œ was not my choosi ng. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was fate. And so Œ so at first, I did some of that all the time, but then there was 
a gentleman by the name of 
Andel
(ph) 
Burns
 
Chal mers
, he was a minister, 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

Protestant minister from the 
United States
, very soft spoken, twice as tall as I was. 
And he deci ded that  I was going to work for hi m. And so Œ 

Q: And he worked in t hat office, too? 

A: Yeah, he was there. Like, he Œ he was the guy responsible for answering 

refugees™ questions, problems. And that i ncluded Œ that included refugees in 
concentration camps. So all the correspondence from the concentration camps came 
to Mr. 
Chalmers Œ 
Dr.
 Chal mers
. And Œ  so gradually, besides going with Mrs. 
Kirschner
, Mrs. 
Kirschner 
was the wife of the president. The president was 
Howard Kirschner
. 

Q: And he Œ of the Quaker organizat ion. 

A: Yes. He is Œ he was the big guy, and he had a deputy, whose name was 
Herbert 

Lagler
, who was a young American.
 Kirschner 
was a very religious man, who had 
made a lot of mone y, and he decided he had t o give back. And so he took over 
helping refugees in 
France
 Œ 
Spain
 and 
France
. And his wife was in charge of all 
the children™s colonies. The y established children™s colonies, there were a lot of kids 

around whose parents had disappeared, and the Quakers t ook them all in, and Œ and 

set up schools. My stomach is working again, I™m sure you hear. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And I™m sorry if they™re recording.  
Q: It™s oka y. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: And he then decided to use me. And he and I sat down and we developed a 
questionnaire, which the Germans call a 
fragebogen
. And we developed a 

questionnaire of all the questions he had to have answered, in order to be able to 

answer the l etters he got from the concentrat ion camps, internment camps, whatever. 

And I got a letter, which I have. I was charged with going to the American consulate. 
Q: Before we get there Œ before we get to t he American consulate, I want to find out 
a little bit more about the office. You know, you mentioned a number of people; the 

local French hire Dr. 
Chal mers
, I think, yes, the 
Kirschners
. How large was the 
office in general? How many empl oyees di d it have, approxi mately? 

A: Oh, at least 25. I have a picture of it in Œ you have the picture t ho Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: The Œ the Œ the Œ there was Œ there was 
Howard Kirschner
 and his wife, and she 
was not in the chai n of comman
d, butshe had afunction.
 

Q: Sure. 

A: And 
Herbert Lagler
, who was a deputy. And then there were about four or five 

people who  were pri nci ples, who had different assignments. 
Chal mers
, there was a 

gentleman by the name of 
Stevenson
(ph), that only worked with refugees, and how 

to help refugees. And I am convinced that t here were a couple peopl e in the office 

who worked for the underground. There was a guy with a wig, wi-wi
t h a cape 
Œ 
Q: No. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
101
 
A: Yeah, that came i n all the ti me. He had a red wig, and with this cape. His name 
was 
Jean-
Julien Chapenoire
(ph). He was French, and I am sure he was part of the 
underground. I just  never figured that he could be anything else. He di dn™t ha Œ he Œ 

he didn™t have a office in the office, but he was there, a lot  of the time. Then the y 

had subsidiaries near the camps, at 
Toulouse
 and a couple place. B ut, I have a 
picture I™ll show you, after we get off the air here, of a meet ing of the Quakers that Œ 

where the y t ook a picture of everybody. And there were secretaries, of course. 

Everybody had a secret ary, an assistant, to do all the paperwork, because most of 

what the y did was paperwork. 

Q: And were most of the Œ aside from the secretary who Œ the receptionist, were 

most everybody Ameri can? 

A: Most were American, but there were some British, there were some Œ a Swede or 
two. There Œ there were some pretty famous names in there. There Œ t here were 
people from western 
E uro pe
 who were in that  sphere of social activity, support, 
whatever. 
Q: Were the y all Quaker? 

A: I doubt it. 

Q: Oka y. Tell me Œ you mentioned earlier t hat you found them remarkable. What 
was Œ what were Œ what were some of the things that struck you that way, about the 
Quakers?  

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: Well, they Œ the y were all very kind people. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The y had a Œ they had a Œ 
I™m n
ot convinced that they were all Quakers. The Œ 
some of them were Unitarians, Mennonites, and so on. And Œ but they had a meeti ng 

every Sunda y morning Œ 
aQuaker meeting every Sunday morning.I™m notsure that 
Howard Kirschner
 was a Quaker, but he was a religious person, very religious. 
The yhada meeting every Sunda y morningin the 
Œ in the conference room, where Œ 
that I was privileged to attend. Where I didn™t understand half of what was going on, 

but because that was Œ we were now at a hi gher intellectual level. And the y did Œ the 

meeting room were about twice as big as this, and Œ and i t consi sted of chairs a-

along the wall. No table. All the wa y on the outside. And people would come i n and 

sit down, and nobody would sa y anything, until somebody would speak up, and 
present some thoughts about some issue. Very highly phi losophical, or Œ or what 
they saw that week, or whatever. And then they™d sit down Œ not  sit down, the y 

never got up Œ and the y would stop, and t hen be a silence, and then somebody else 

would pick up, and so t hat Œ 

Q: Did they talk Œ would the y respond to the first statement, or would they then say 

their own?  

A: Yeah. I don™t remember all the details, but the y Œ they Œ it was not Œ it was not 
coordinated any way, it was all on the spur of the moment , the spi rit of it. And it

was, you know, because it was a hi gh level  English, I Œ some of that I didn™t 
understand. That was not m y level . My level was somewhere here. But it was very 

inspiring, i t was very beautiful. 

Q: I Œ I Œ I™d like to understand Œ make sure t hat I understand it better. 

Q2: Now might be a good time to pause for lunch.  
Q: I Œ I Œ I know, but I want to finish this one question, i s Œ if it™s possible. Oka y. 
When somebody would say something, and they finished, would then there be 
a 

discussion from others, that would revolve around that topic, or Œ or not? 

A: I can™t answer that any more. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I Œ I don™t think so, but it ma y have been. It  ma y be the next one who spoke took 

off from where the first one left off. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: But it wa Œ it was not a discussion across t he room. 

Q: That™s one of the question Œ 

A: It was j ust a present ation of thoughts, which ma y have been, or m ay not have 

been related to what the first person said. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. Let™s pause here, and we™ll come back. Thank you. 

A: Thank you.

Q: Thank you very Œ 
[brea k]
 Okay, before the break, we were talking about your 
work, the work that  you were starti ng to Œ to do with the Quaker organization in 
Marseilles
, and how you ended up working with Dr.
 Chal mers
. And 
tell me now 
how that developed, and what Œ how it took you from their offices to the offices of 

the 
U
.
S
. consulate in 
Marseilles
. Describe t hat to me. 
A: Yeah, the Œ a-
as Dr. 
Chal mers
 and I got to know each other bet ter, and he was 
overwhelmed, because the number of people i n these camps that wrot e to hi m, was 

very, very large. And so he got a great number of Œ of letters every day, with people 

pleading for assistance to save their life by getting an American vi sa, if they coul d. 

The Œ he felt that I knew enough about things, and Œ so that he appointed me to be 

his leg- man, his messenger, if you wish Œ it was more than a messenger, a messenger 
is an understatement Œ to the American consul ate, to answer the quest ion, which 
basicallyamounted to, what
™s the status of my papers, and pos-possibility to get a 
visa to the 
United States
, from every one of these people that wrote. So he and I 
devised a questionnaire so I could quickly go through files and Œ and fill out the 

blanks, and so he could answer the letters. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So the y Œ they Œ they Œ  they gave me Œ they gave me a letter, which I Œ to present 
to the guard at the American consul ate. After a few times, the guard knew me, so I 
didn™t need the letter, but initially saying that I was the representati ve of the 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Quakers, and I coul d have access to the consulate. And so I started going to the 
consulate, I would sa y twice a week, to do this. Number one, it wasn Œ it wasn™t easy 

to get into the consulat e, for normal human beings. There was a li ne of people 

around the block to get  into the American consulate, to see a representative of the 

consulate, t o find out t he status of their papers, if they were able t o do this. What I 
was handli ng is the people who weren™t able to come to the consul ate. 
Q: Can you describe the consulate building physi cally, like you did the Quaker 

building, next to 
Ho tel Splendide
? What did Œ  where was it, and so Œ 
A: It™s Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s one block from the pol ice prefecture, which Œ in the middle 

of town, which is a mammoth building. And there™s a square, I don™t remember the 

name of the square. I can tell you that toda y
, the 
Œ which is not your question, but 
toda y the consulate™s moved up about 10 bui ldings, and has a square, and the address 
of the square is 
Place Varian Fry
, which I think is an interesting little thing that 
nobody™ll t ell you, unless you go there and you see it. But they were on a middl e of a 
block, with mammoth oak door, it  was an old office building. Or it could have been 

a private home, wit h a fairl y large number of rooms in it, then you went in from the 

street, up some steps, and then you were inside the consul ate. 

Q: So there was no Œ it wasn™t such that it was a building that had a yard around it, 

and then a wall, or a gate, and you were Œ  
A: No. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

106
 
Q: No, it was actually a building Œ 
A: At that time Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ it was part of a Œ because it came out of peace ti me, it was stil l the same thing it 

had been before, in peaceti me, where people just went to a consulate, like you go to 
any office building. Well, there w
as a sm 
Œ relatively small building, but it was 
attached on both si des, to other buildings. 
Q: And did the 
U
.
S
. consulate have the entire building to itself, or only certain 
floors? 

A: To this Œ to thi s buil ding, yes.  
Q: The whole building? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: And about how li Œ 
how many stories did ithave?
 
A: I believe not more t han two. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: It was not a Œ it was more a spread out buil ding, and deep building, than it was a 

high building. 

Q: Did you have a sense of how many Œ how l arge a place it was, how many people 

worked there, at the time? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
107
 
A: No, I don™t Œ I can™t tell you that. I Œ because I only related with certain people. I 
related to the people in the consulate divisi on. A consulate has other functions. Like 

the con Œ I never saw t he consul general, not that I would Œ I wanted to. He was not a 

very nice guy, I™m told. But I only dealt with the consular staff, the people that 

handed Œ handled t he people applyi ng for visa, or it 
could havebeen Americans who 
came in, to have a st amp put in their passport. But that was the one section of the Œ 
the consulat e, overal l, t hat I dealt with. 

Q: Oka y. Again, to Œ for Œ for me to be able to get a pict ure of this, t here are people 

who are standing outside with a li ne winding around a square, or you know, th
e y™re 

waiting for a long t i me. And Œ and if they™re coming on their own to see Œ to find out 

the status of their application. When you go in, do you go to the same window t hat 

the y would go, except t hat yours is streamlined, that is you are able to not have to 
wait in line? Or, is it that you don™t have t o stand by a window, you™re actually 
admitted to a place beyond a counter, that normal  people wouldn™t be able to get  to? 

A: The latter. I Œ once I got past the guard, I was on m y own. 

Q: Oh, oka y. 

A: I went i n the building to the sect ion where t he consular department  was, and they 

had this mammoth file room. You could call it a conference room. It had a big, big, 

long oaken table in the mi ddle, and the rest  of the room were file cabi nets, all the 
way again 
Œ  against  the wall, all the wa y around Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
108
 
Q: So around the Œ around the perimeter. 
A: Œ around the table. And so, I went in there, I didn™t ask anybody for anything, I 

just went i n, and I put m y briefcase and my fi les on the table. And the files were 

organized al phabeticall y. So I started at 
A
, and worked m y wa y around. And you 

know, I had my Œ m y request letters also in alphabetical order, so I could work my 
way in some kind of orderly fashion, to look up the files of the people whose 
requests I had. 

Q: Was
 there anybody else from the consular office in the room at the time? 

A: No. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: It was me in charge. 

Q: Wow.
 
A: It™s Œ it™s Œ when you think about it, especiall y nowada ys, you know, I worked in 
embassies and consulat es later in life, it Œ it was totally inconceivable. It was that I Œ 

and you know, as I sa y, I was a 15 year old bo
y 
Œ  that I was Œ I had this access. Once 
I was inside, I was free to in Œ wit hin the consular section, not the whole consulat e Œ 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Œ I don™t Œ didn™t get involved there. But I just went in there and did my job. 
Q: But nevertheless though, I mean, these are important files Œ 
A: Of course. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: Œ you know, and very vital to t he people who are request ing. 
A: Life and death. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And the Œ the Œ you know, and every ti me I went in there, I also looked under 

Ho ckenhei mer
. 
Q: I wanted to ask you that. 

A: And see oh, has anything come in from the last ti me, you know, from our 

relatives. 

Q: Now, when your family put together your request, who did you approach to be 

your sponsors in t he 
United States
? 

A: Oh, in t he 
United States
? Well, there were two. There was m y mother™s sister, 

Elsa
(ph) and 
Charlie Hei man
(ph), who had only been i n the 
United States
 since 
1939, I beli eve, so the y weren™t that  well established in 1940 Œ ™41. B ut he was a 
businessman, and so he gave us what was required, probably still is, an affidavit. 

Andthen m y mot her™s brother 
Walter
, 
Walter Lowen
(ph), he changed his name 
from 
Lowenthal
 to 
Lowen
(ph), he lived in 
Seattle
, and he gave us another 
statement. What the y wanted is a st atement sa ying we would not become wards of 

the state. That™s really what it amounted t o. And so we had these, and the Œ the Œ the 

Œ the consulate ha Œ the consul, in charge of consul affairs had to Œ had to decide 
whether it was enough, or not, semicolon;  the policy in 
Washington
 was not to give

any visas. 
Cordell Hull
 was Secret ary of State, and he had a sidekick who was 
worse, and their polic y was not to give visas to refugees. Jewish refugees, I can™t tell 

you exactly, b
ut that was the polic y. The Œ  the consul general in 
Marseilles
, whose 
name just came to my mi nd, was 
Fullerton
. Mr.
 Fullerton
 was abi ding by these 
instructions, and on his staff he had vice-consul 
Hiram Bingham
, and who had a 
sidekick whose name was 
Miles 
Sta ndish
. If you want to be American, you can™t 
get more American t han 
Hiram Bingham
 and 
Miles Standish
. And t hey were on 

their own. The y, on their own, decided. The y met  the refugees. 
Mi les Standish
 and 

Bingham
 went t o 
Saint Nicolas 
camp, and Œ and got th
e 
Lion Feuchtwanger
 out 
while he was washing himself at the creek, a-and the y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ t he y had a taxi 

standing nearby. The y Œ they quickly changed him into a woman, and had hi m sit in 

the back of the seat. And when the police stopped the taxi , the y said, who is that in 
the back? Oh, that™s my mother-in-law from 
Georgia
, and the taxi waved them on. 
He was an American consul, so t he y thought he had some authority. And t
hat™s how 
they got hi m out of there, but you could have access to Œ to 
Saint Ni colas
, in 

N
iemes
. But anyway, i t Œ 
Hiram Bingham
 worked with 
Varian Fry
, they met 
secretly in places, to exchange information on getting the people t hat 
Eleanor 
Roosevelt
 wanted out. How to figure out how to get them passport, and get them on 

a boat, or another boat, over the mountains, into 
Spa in
, or what ever. There were Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: So, I mean Œ 
I mean 
Œ of course, 
Eleanor Roosevelt
 was not part  of the Œ 
formally a part of the 
U
.
S
. government. However, as the wife of the president, she™s 
clearly has i nterests that are in contradiction to Mr. 
Hull
, you know Œ 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Œ at the State depart ment. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So it sounds Œ 

A: But she was a power. 

Q: Yes. 

A: 
Eleanor Roosevelt
 was a power unto herself, and nobody would have challenged 

Œ 
Cordell lul Œ 
H ull
 would not have challenged 
Eleanor Roosevelt
. So this is the 
kind of stuff that you Œ you know, put a bl ind eye on it. But Œ but what 
Hiram 
Bingham
 did, you know, was spectacular, because he issued 2,500 visas to people 
without permission from Œ from 
Washing Œ 
Q: Now, wasn™t that risking getting into a lot of hot water? 

A: Oh yeah, he did. He got into a lot of hot water. He Œ we left in May of ™41, in 

June of ™41, the y Œ they canned hi m. The y pulled hi m out . Some people knew about 

hi m, and complained to 
Vichy
. We had an American ambassador in 
Vichy
, Admiral 
Leahy
, and somebody got at hi m. He was no particular wonderful person, and t he y Œ 
they put pressure on him, and the y Œ they pull ed him out  and send hi m first to 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

112
 
Lisbon
 for a few months, and then to south 
Montevideo
. And then, I don™t remem Œ 
I don™t know what the y did exactly, but the y Œ he retired, or quit the foreign servi ce 
because the y made life so miserable for him, and never got another job. 
Q: Within the government, or Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: So he did pa y a stiff price. 
A: 
Yeah
, he Œ he was Œ as a result, he was kicked out of the government. But he sa Œ 
had saved 2,500 people. He was a very tall man, he had 11 children. He Œ he 

followed his conscience. 

Q: Did you have interaction with hi m? 

A: Yes. One ti me, I Œ ma ybe more, but I remember one ti me, the Œ i n Œ in March, 

approxi mately, of ™41, Mr.
 Chalmers 
Œ Dr.
 
Chal mers
 said to me one da y, I have Œ 
had you 
Œ as you know, I live with 
Hiram Bingham 
Œ which I di dn™t know Œ and we 
spoke last night, and he said next t ime you are at the consulate, drop in to see him. 

And as you can wel l i magine, I went to t he consulate the next da y. I didn™t let any 

grass grow under m y feet. And there I had t o, you know, ask Œ t here was a Miss 

Houligan
(ph), who was kind of the admi nistrative person there, she was a nice 
person. And I told her t hat 
Hiram Bingham
 wanted to see me, and so she took me 
in to see him. And he said to me, you know, t h-the Quakers highly recommend you 
and your family. I Œ I know your dad is at 
Gurs
, and we™re ready to issue you vi sas. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
113
 
But if you issue a visa, it™s only good for 90 days, and Œ but your dad is at 
Gurs
, so 
we first have to get your dad out of 
Gurs
 before I advise that you get a vise, 
otherwise, i t might  run out before you get t o the 
United States
, and you have to start 
from scratch. And so he Œ he Œ he said, I™m gi ving you a letter, addressed to the 

commandant at Œ at 
Gurs
, whoever™s in charge, and sa ying Œ on American si Œ 
consulate st ationery, saying that we™re prepared to issue your family a visa, and t he 

chances are
 
50
-50 that the y™ll let him go. And so Œ and then, you come back. And so 
we Œ we Œ he gave me t he letter, we sent it to Dad, they let hi m out. 
Q: But I want to stop right here. I can™t imagine what you must have felt like when 

you heard those words. I mean, out  of so many years of uncertainty.  

A: You have to remember, I was 15 years old. At 15, you don™t go int o all the 

possible angles. All that mattered t o me is that the American consulate was going to 
give us a vi sa to get out . That Œ th-that, you know. And you can imagi ne how my 
mother felt. And so, you know, and that came Œ 

Q: How did she Œ how did she react  when you told her? 

A: Well, she was Œ 
wel l, you 
Œ honestly, you didn™t believe any of it until after it 
happened. That Œ you know, I™ll give you an example in a second. The Œ the Œ so we 

get Œ Dad came back, so we had to get out, okay? So the debate became, how do you 

get out? You could Œ you had two options; you could go through 
Spain
. There was a 
guy by the name of 
Francisco Franco 
there, who could have caused you a hard 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

114
 
time, you didn™t know. Or, you could take a ship from 
Marseilles
 to t he 
West 
Indies
. Now, there weren™t that many ships, but th-the y Œ there were some. And so 
we decided oka y, so we worked, from the point of view, when was our ship going? 

And so, there was a ship on the si xth of May, t he 
W innipeg
, and there was a ship on 
the 10
th
 of May, the 
Wyoming
. And so, you had to get ship™s passage, which wasn™t 
a given. You needed an exit visa from 
France
, and you needed a transit visa for the 
French 
West Indi es
, and you needed ship™s passage. And so we started working on 

that. The Quakers, t he Œ 
Herbert Lagler
, the number two guy at the Quakers, cal led 

the president of the French line, and said, we have four members of our staff Œ note 

the Œ the wording Œ who are ready to go to the 
States
, we need four bunks, passages, 

whatever. And the president Œ the y didn™t start at the bott om, the y went to the 

president of the French line. And t he presi dent of the French line said, we Œ we have 
no more cabins. And 
Herbert Lagl er 
said, well, our staff members will take any 
accommodation. Which meant the hold of the ship, because these shi ps were not  

passenger ships, the y had ca Œ the y were freighters with some cabins. And so the y 

had turned t he Œ the hold into receptacles for human beings. And sa y Œ our quo Œ our 

members will Œ wi ll take whatever you got. So, oka y. So Œ I™m stepping si-sidewa y 

here. 

Q: That™s oka y. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
115
 
A: And we Œ the y sent me as a messenger from t he Quakers, to the French line, 
called the 
Messager
ies M
ariti mes
, to pick up the tickets and give hi m a check. And 
Œ and I got the tickets, and he said, who are you? I™m the messenger of the Quakers, 

oka y? So I had my four tickets, which turned out to Œ wel l, I™ll get to that. And then 

we had to get the papers from the French police prefecture, for exit visa and the 
transit visa. And t his is where the st ory alwa ys gets me, is that we knew that on t he 
second floor of the house, the apartment house we lived in, there was a lady, middle-

aged lady, who lived with her aunt and uncle, they were Corsicans. They were called 

Gigliel mi
(ph)
 Morachini
(ph). And we knew her Œ them Œ we di dn™t know her aunt 

and uncle at all, but Œ and I can™t tel l you whet her her name was 
Gigli elmi
(ph), or 

Morachini
(ph). But, be that as it may. And Œ but we knew she worked for the 
French poli ce prefecture. So m y mother and I went, rang her doorbell . And all we 
knew about her was from sa ying, 
bo njour Madame
, as we went higher up than she 
lived, as she came out t he door. And we said, Madame, we understand that you work 
at the police prefecture, and this is our situation. We have visa for the 
United States
, 

we™re leaving, we need a French exit visa, and transit visa, and can you help us with 

that? She said yes. And she said, I will bri ng you the papers tomorrow, to fill out. So, 

she Œ next da y we saw her, and she Œ she gave us some questionnaires to fill out, and 

we filled them out. Rang her doorbell, and said, here are the papers. Okay, I will l et 
you know when I get t he answer. Few days later she contacted us, and she said, the 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

papers are ready, and Œ  but you have to go pick them up yourself, because you have 
to get a stamp, and they Œ  they put Œ past e the stamp on there, like a postage stamp, 

but it™s a fee, or whatever. So I went there, and I picked up the papers, and again 

they asked me who I was, and I said, I™m t he messenger. And I gave them the mone y 

they wanted, and you know, the y don™t ask 15 year old kids much. You Œ you™ve Œ if 
I had been 25, it would have been different, but I wasn™t.  
Q: Someti mes that™s lucky. 

A: Yeah. Well, that™s what Œ m y whole life has been like that. And I Œ I Œ I Œ 
I ga 
Œ 
so I wound up wit h the Œ with the French exit visas, and with the transit visa for the 

Œ for the 
Martinique
. And 
Œ and you have to ask yourself the question, is why did 
she do that?  

Q: Yeah. 
A: She was a nice lady, she knew us for years, she knew whe Œ we were nice peopl e, 
good neighbors. She di dn™t know any Œ a t hing about us, otherwi se. And she spoke 

from her conscience. And every ti me I tell t his story, I have a hard ti me telling i t, 

because it was such a unexpected thing, that came out of Œ you know. It™s just Œ it™s a 

human Œ it  was a human gesture that Œ that just transcends anythi ng you can say 

about anything. And so we had all that, and then we Œ we had a Œ we had to get ri d 

of all our furniture. And so we did that, I don™t remember how, m y parents did that. 
And m y mother 
Œ m y dad said, before we got the tickets, m y dad said,

 on the 10

Wyoming
, it™ll 
give us four more da ys to get everyt hing taken care of. And that™s t he one time in my 
life that I heard my mother said, over m y dead body. I don™t know how you say that 

in German, but she sai d, over my dead body, we™re leaving on the si xth of May. And 

so, on the sixth of Ma y Œ now, we did take some things along. My si ster and I don™t 
know how there™s Œ if you go around the corner here, there™s a mam moth oil painting 
of the Bavarian

in there. That came out  with us. We have no idea how they did 
that, absolutely no idea.

A: And he checked everybody that  got up there. The y were looking for people that 

were on thei r list. Wi Œ thank God, we were not important enough, so we were not 

on their list, so we got up there. But the y did arrest a Œ a few people t here. The wife 

of a former member of Parliament, and a few people like that. And so then,
 

W innipeg
 took off, sixth of May. We went  from 
Marseill es
 to 
Oran
 in 
Algeria
, did 
not dock. Then we turned west, to 
Gibral tar
, we went through 
Gibraltar 
to 
Casablanca
. We stoppedin 
Casablanca
. We were able to touch the soil, I™ve Œ I™ve 
touched the soil of

Q: Did you see 
Humphrey Bogart
? 

A: No, he wasn™t t here. Even 
Sam 
the piano player wasn™t there. 

Q: W
asn™t there. 
A: And we Œ it was m y sister™s birthda y, t he 14
th
 
ofMay, 1940. And m y dadhad 
connections in Œ in 
Casa
, and because it was her birthda y, he got a message to them, 
and the guy came on a motorc ycle, to bring her some strawberries. She was

supposed to get whipped cream, but  he said it was too hot, and t he whipped cream 
would be sour. So I™ve been giving m y si ster strawberries and whipped cream ever 

since then, every year. But, so then we left Œ 

Q: How lovely. 

A: Œ we left
 Casa
, and went down along 
North
 
Africa
, down to 
Dakar
, but did not 
touch.
 Dakar
 is ri ght on the equator. And we went across the equator to the 
West 

Indies
. Now, the da y before we got to 
Martinique Œ 
actually, a night and a half 
before we got to 
Marti nique
, it was so damn hot in the ship Œ t here are lots of things 
about the ship that I™ll spare you, but it was so hot, there was no way I could stay 

down Œ down in t he Œ i n the hold. I mean, you Œ you just Œ you suffocated. And I Œ 

about midnight I went up on deck, and I Œ just  to get some air, just to breathe. And I 

became aware of several things. One of them was that it was pitch black. The sea 
was totally cal m, there was no wave going on. But then I dis-discovered, or decided 
that the shi p wasn™t really moving. I said oh, what™s going on here? And I went  and I 

looked and talked t o some people, and we were just sitting there. And then all of a 

sudden, from all sides, we were lit up in Œ in li ghts, as the focal point, and some Œ 

some rope l adders were thrown up on the ship, and a bunch of characters came up, 

and we coul dn™t tell  who the y were. They had no uniform on, the y wore blue jeans, 

or whatever, and they all had weapons. And they spoke a l anguage which I didn™t

understand, which you know, I Œ I was pretty good at languages, but I didn™t know 
what the y were talki ng. And so the y took us over, the y cap Œ  

Q: But what did they look like? 

A: Œ 
theycaptured us. And 
Œ  
Q: Pirates?  
A: No. The y Œ 
they were 
Œ the y were Œ the y were Dutch, of the wi ld Dutch arm y in 
exile, the Œ the free Dut ch, who had gone to 
England
, and they captured us on 
behalf of the Œ on behalf of the British, and they t ook us to the French Œ to the 
British to trade that , at the British 
West Indies
. 

Q: Well, so what flag was the 
W i nnipeg
 fl ying under? 
A: Well, that Œ that Œ t hat is very cogent question, because we didn™t know who the y 

were, but in the morning when we got dayl ight, I looked at  the flag, and the flag 
wasn™t tricolor any more, it was orange, which represented the House of 
Orange-
Nassau
 of the 
Netherla nds
. And so the y took us in, the y took us to 
Port
 
of
 
Spain
, 
Trinidad
, and they had captured us. Of course, we had some French soldiers aboard, 
going to 
Ma rtini que 
as replacements, or whatever. And t hen the Œ the Œ the radio 

operator barricaded hi mself in the thing, and he called in the French for whatever, 

and the Œ 
one ef 
Œ one airplane came, and somebody Œ the y didn™t do anyt hing, they 

just took us to 
Trinidad
.

Q: But what a footnote. I mean, everyt hing that we know about World War II is that 
the French, and the Bri tish were allies. And here Œ 

A: Not after 
Vichy
, thi s was 
Vichy
. 
Q: Uh-huh, oka y. These were 
Vichy
 Œ  
A: This was a 
Vichy
 ship. 
Q: A
 Vichy
 ship. 
A: I™m sorry I didn™t say t hat. A 
Vichy
 ship, it was flying under the 
Vi chy
 flag, 
going to 
Ma rtinique
, which 
was under the con Œ 
control of 
Vichy
. Now, the reason 
I understand they did it Œ 
[phone ringing, break] 

Q: So, 
Vichy
. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: 
Vichy
 and 
Ma rtini que
.  
A: Yeah. And they Œ they took us to 
Tri nidad
, which was British, and the reason 
they did it, I™m told, is that the Germans, 
Rommel
 in 
North Africa
 had Œ had given 
the Nazis the rights to use airports in 
Syria
. Haven™t you heard of 
Syria
 before? And 
as a countermeasure, the Œ the Brit ish deci ded a Œ he y, you think we can™t do 

anyt hing? So the British decided to Œ okay, as punishment, they decided to sh Œ 

decided to seize a 
Vichy
 French ship. The Œ we happened t o be on board. The reason 

this is so i mportant about the Œ the Œ the 
Winnipeg
 and the 
Wyoming
, is because 
when the 
W innipeg
 was captured, the 
Wyoming
, four da ys behind us, was off the 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

coast of 
Africa
, coming across the equator. And when Œ and when this happened, 
when the 
W innipeg
 was captured, the 
Wyoming
 was turned around, back to 
Africa
, 
so he woul dn™t be capt ured, and the people who were in t he 
Wyoming
 spent t he rest 
of the war in Œ in Œ in 
Senegal
, some of them working on the 
Trans- Sahara 
rail 

line. 
Q: Your mother was so right. 
A: Not one more day. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: Every day Œ when you get in a situation like this, don™t dela y anything, because 

you never know what™s changing t omorrow. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: And so that™s Œ that™s why the 
W innipeg
, 
Wyoming 
story is important, because 
the alternative would have been, we wa Œ would have wound up i n 
Africa
. 

Q: Now, 
W innipeg
 and 
Wyoming
 are not French names. 
A: No, but ships can have Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ any name. The 
W i nnipeg
 was sunk during World War II, in Œ in the 
Atlantic
, 
when it was worki ng for the allies. 

Q: Was it? 
A: Yeah. Yeah, you can look up t hat kind of stuff Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ on the web nowadays. 

Q: Oka y. So what happened to you when you were in 
Trinidad
? How did things 
develop?  

A: Well, the Œ the people of
 Trinidad
 had Œ were told that  the British had captured 
the German warship, which we were not. And so half of 
Trinidad
 was out on the 
pier, trying to see what these Germans looked like, and of course, it was women and 

children. And the British were very nice. The y put us in a camp, but the camp was 

nicely organized. The y fed us, and whatever. And to the extent t hat t hey even 

produced buses to t ake us on a tour of 
Port of 
Spa in
.  
Q: Really. 

A: So it Œ it was no hardship post. And so what we Œ but what we needed to do, you 
see, because our trip was arranged for us to take a ship out of 
Ma rti nique 
to 
New 
York
, it was all paid for. And we weren™t i n 
Martinique
, so we couldn™t take a ship 
from 
Ma rti nique
 to 
New York
. So we had to start from scratch on t hat, but we were 
safe.
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And so my mother contacted her sister, 
Elsie
(ph) and 
Charlie Hei man
(ph) i n 
Cincinnati
, and t he y Œ they booked passages for us from 
Trini da d 
to Œ to 
New 
York
 on t he luxury liner called the 
SS Urug ua y
, which came from 
South America
,

to 
New York
. And after being on that Œ on the 
W innipeg
, in the hold, being a guest 
like a first class passenger on the 
Uruguay
, was another world. It Œ it  was, you 
know, we Œ dining Œ ai r conditioned dining room, waiters with gloves, silver tra ys. I 
mean, how Œ how can Œ you know, you have t o ask yourself, where t he hell did that 

come from, you know?  
Q: Yeah. 
A: It was a little difficult, because there was a tropical storm Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ 
thathitus. When m y mother and m y sist erwentont he 
Œ 
on the 
Uruguay
 
without a problem, then m y dad and I were behind, getti ng the luggage, and 

accompanyi ng the luggage. And when we went from Œ 
from 
Port of Spain
, that Œ 
the 
Uruguay
 was too big to come into the harbor. It had to sit outside. And Œ 
Q: So you had to go by boat? 

A: And Œ or a little boat, one puff -pu-pu-pu Œ l ittle one-horsepower motor. And there 
were about, I don™t know, 20 people on this thi ng. It was a little cabin with a Œ wi th 

the guy in charge, the pilot. And we didn™t all fit in. There was a young doctor, by 

the name of Dr. 
Hirschberg
(ph) Œ I just saw his name yesterda y, somewhere. He 

and I were outside, and our job was, when the cycl one hit us, to Œ you know, thes
e 
little boats have tires on the side, so that when they hit something else Œ 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: Œ they don™t fall apart. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so every ti me a wave came, he woul d throw the tire on Œ on the deck, and 

Hirschberg
(ph) or I would throw the tire back out in the water, you know. So when 

we got to the Œ to t he 
Urug ua y
, they had a plat form at the bottom, wit h a gangplank, 
and this thing would come to the gangplank, and they Œ t he y said jump. I sa ys, I™m 

not gonna jump. I was soaking wet, I had wat er in my shoes. I was soaked, you 

know? Every wave had gone over m y head. Said, I™m not jumping, because if I slip, 

the thing™ll  come back and I™ll fall between, it™ll crush me. I said, I Œ I™m not 

jumping. My mot her was up there l ooking down. She recognized me. And the 

captain was standing next to her, and she started screaming, and the captain said, 

what™s goi ng on. She said, that™s my son, that™s m y son. And he sent down some 
sailors on the platform, and one of them jumped on our li ttle boat, and the other one 
held the rope, and the one held me until I was on the Œ 

Q: Other si de. 

A: Œ on the other side, and I went up Œ I wa Œ I was seasick for a while because Œ 

from that Œ from the lit tle boat, you know?  

Q: Oh yeah.

A: The 
Uruguay
 was sitting there like it was a mountain in the water, wasn™t 
moving. But that was t he last part of trip. We had to Œ you know, we had to get a 
touch of everything. So then we came to 
New York
, and Œ  
Q: But from that Œ from that poi nt of Œ of Œ of risk, of getting from t he small boat 

into there, you go i nto air conditioned spaces, with white gloves and silverware, and 
first class, and all of that. 
A: Yep. 

Q: My God, what an adventure. 

A: I Œ you know, i t was Œ it™s beyond Œ we didn™t have the proper clot hes, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: In Œ in that dini ng room, you™re supposed t o dress up with a t ie, and so on. I 

didn™t have anything li ke that. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: So Œ but there i s Œ it  went fine, I just Œ I got  over my seasickness by go Œ jumping 

in a swimming pool. 

Q: The y had a swi mmi ng pool? 

A: Oh, the y had several swimming pool. This was first class. 
Q: And just a question, that painti ng must  have been spent  Œ sent other wa ys. I can™t 

imagine you bringi ng a painting on a boat, a li ttle boat, going up to the 
Uruguay
.

A: You know, nobody™s ever asked me that  question. It must have gone with us. I Œ I

Q: I mean, but how would you go from a smal l boat to the Œ anywa y, it™s just a 
detail. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What was it like when you got to

? What di d you see?  

A: Well, I Œ I Œ I Œ we decided to Œ we sta yed with relatives, I don™t remember 

exactly whom, but Œ 

Q: I™m talking about the harbor. Di d you see 
Lady Liberty?
 
A:Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,I 
Œ in Œ in m y book it says that t wice in m y li fe I ha Œ have 
had this experience. The first one when Œ when we passed the Statue of Liberty, the 

feeling that this bri ngs out in you. And just to have arrived somewhere where the y 

won™t kill you. And the second time that happened to me i s on the other side of the 

country, when I ca Œ as a lieutenant , I came back from 14 months in 
Korea
, and we 
went under the Golden Gate bridge, and I al most went apart, because, you know, I 

feel the same way about the Golden Gate bridge as I feel about the Statue of Liberty. 
It™s just a Œ  you know, this feeling of, whew, I made it again, you know, kind of Œ

A: Tha
nk you.
 
Q: Oka y. 
[break] 
So, you come into 
New York
 harbor, and you™re met by family, 
relatives there. Tell me how Œ what happened then. Where did you folks go, where 

did you settle? 

A: Well, the Œ basicall y, m y family settled in 
New York
. However, t he same aunt 
and uncle in 
Cinci nna ti
 I™ve talked about, 
Elsa
(ph) and 
Charlie
 
Heiman
(ph), 
invited me to come stay with them for a while, until my parents got settled. And so, I 
moved to Œ to 
Ci ncinnati
. My mother and sister went wit h me, and dropped me off 
wer Œ and stayed a l ittl e bit. My grandmother was there. The y all l ived in the same 

little court. And I spent  15 months, approxi matel y, in 
Cincinnati
. I graduated high 
school, at 16, in 
Cincinnati
. Decided I™d learned everything I would ever learn. The 

only thing they made me take is a course i n civics. I had to be in a Œ good American, 

so I Œ I took that, and American hi story, two courses. Then I graduat ed high school, 

and then I Œ  I started at  the University of 
Cincinnati
. I Œ I worked during the day, I 
had to Œ you know, that was part of the Œ

Q: What were you doing? 
A: Pardon?  

Q: What were you doing? 

A: Oh, I was working as a si Œ first I was working as an errand boy for an optical 

company on a bicycle. And I went  over from 
Cincinnati
 to 
Covington
 and 
Newport
,
 
Kentucky
 every da y. And then I decided that was too cold in winter, or 
something, and I got a j ob as a stock clerk i n a Œ in a textil e company. When I got 

bored of that, I got a job as a stock boy in a toy company. Those were the three jobs I 

had, and I went to school at night, while I was there. And then, in Oct ober of ™42, a 

re Œ the connection t here was that m y Œ m y aunt and uncle had a son who was Œ who 

was nine months younger than I am, and so he and I were buddies, and he taught me 

all about 
America
. He™d been there all of two years. A-And the Œ and he and I are 
great friends to this da y. Then I went to 
New York
, and m y uncle was always sure I 
needed a job to earn m one y. You know, that™s the wa y he operated. He was no big 

intellectual, he was Œ and kind of frowned upon by that part of the family, because 

all we wanted to do, my sister and I, was go to college. And that wasn™t necessary, in 

orderto make money. So 
Œ but i n 
New York
 I worked first for a text ile company
, 
that he probably got me the job. And then Œ and then I decided I could do better 

things. I went to school at night. I went to city college in 
New York
 at night, and 
played soccer on the weekends, in the French sporting club, and became quickly Œ

well, from t he begi nning, even in 
Cincinnati
, I was totally Œ you have to understand, 
that having had the experience that I had with the Quakers, I was not a normal kid. I 
had the war Œ 
thewar weighedvery heavily on m y 
Œ on m y personality, and I 
couldn™t see where al l t hese people were Œ people were sitting around and having a 

good ti me, when t here were people dying i n Œ in 
Euro pe
 and nobody was helping 
them. And so I was getti Œ got involved i n Œ in Œ even in 
Cincinnati
 I joined the 
Alliance Française
, and tried to get people int erested in what™s going on in 
Euro pe
, 
and we can™t just Œ 

Q: Whatis the 
Alli ance Française
? 
A: It™s Œ it™s a cultural Œ it™s a cultural Œ 

Q: French?  

A: But French. And they had speakers. And si nce there were a lot of Frenchmen in 
exile at that point, t he y had speakers relating t o the Œ to the war. The Œ 
Ron
 
sent me 
a bunch of Œ of documents from t he Quakers, which Œ which Œ that Œ which included 

letters that I wrote from 
Cincinnati
 to the Quakers, aski ng them for certain actions, 
and do that, and do this, and do that. And Œ you know, normally no organization 

would pa y attention to what a 15 year old has to say, but I Œ I just was Œ I couldn™t 

get that out of my system. So when I got to 
New York
, besides everything else, I 
quickly got involved politically in the Œ with t he f Œ free French youth, the Œ the 
de

youth. That was a great

Q: Did you see yoursel f at that point, as no more German, but now French? Or did 

you know Œ did you have ti me to have questions of who am I, what Œ what is m y 

identity? 
A: I was French. 
Q: You were French, okay. 

A: I did the Œ I became the secretary general of the free French youth in the

Q: Oka y. 

A: And Œ and I was very i nvolved in Œ in raising money for the free French forces, 

stuff like that. I Œ until Œ until I went into the army, which was basicall y right after

th
 birthda y. 
Q: Did you sign up, were you drafted? How did that occur? 
A: It worked like t his, t hat I couldn™t Œ I couldn™t volunteer before I was 18, because 

I was not a citizen. That™s the way I remember it. But on m y 18
th

the draft board and sa y hey, here I am. And they took only six weeks to Œ

what was going on, and here I was free, and now the other people were dying over 
there. So that really was Œ it really worked on me. I wanted to join the free French 

forces, and my dad sai d, if you do, you never have to come back t o m y house. And 

of course, you have to understand, he had been Œ what he had gone through, bet ween 

the jail and the Œ and 
L es Milles
 and 
Gurs
, there were part of his Œ part of his brain 
didn™t like the French, because the y hadn™t been nice to hi m.  

Q: The y hadn™t been. 

A: The y hadn™t been. 

Q: The y hadn™t. 

A: And so I understand that, but s Œ but I Œ I joined the army, basicall y ri ght after I 

was 18, and went t o basic training, 
Fort Bragg
,
 
North Carolina
, and then the y send 

me to 
Œ I was a radi o operator Œ they send me to radio school in 
Oklahoma
 for four 
months, because I was so good at that, the y were going to use me. And then the y 

send me back to Œ t hen the y assign me to an artillery outfit back in 
Fort Bragg
,
 

North Carolina
. And t hat™s when I decided enough was enough, this was stupid, the 

arm y didn™t  know what  it was doi ng, and I Œ I was fluent in French and German, I 

wasn™t doi ng anybody any good in the 
South
 
Pacific 
as Œ as a radi o operator in a 
heavy artillery outfit. And so on Œ I Œ after 
Okl a homa
 they gave me a leave, on the 
way to 
North Carolina
. And as only, you know, you have to be determined, but 
what could the y do to me? I was a private, they couldn™t demote me. So I Œ when I Œ

I went to 
Washington
, I got off the train, I went to the Pentagon, and I asked to 
speak to somebody in i ntelligence, and I Œ I got to si Œ i t was the da y after a holi
day 
Œ I got to see a lieut enant colonel who was very, very nice, and I 
t old hi m m yst ory, 

told hi m what I just told you, and I said, you know, this i s absol utely a waste in time. 

He said, well Œ he went somewhere, then he came back, sai d well, you know, th
e 
Œ 
the boss isn™t here today, he has the day off. But don™t worry about it, I™ll take care 

of it. And you just go t o 
North Carolina
, and just don™t sa y anyt hing to anybody, 
just do what you™re tol d to do, and you™ll hear from us. And boy did Œ he was as 

good as his word. 

Q: How long did i t take? 

A: Oh, four, six weeks at the most . I was on dut y at night Œ duty, on guard duty at 

night, and the first sergeant ne Œ had never paid any attent ion to me, came to my post 
in the middle of nowhere somewhere. And he said, 
Ho-Hockley
, I Œ you gotta come 
with me, I got a little pl ace for you. I said, oh? I acted very innocent . And he sai d Œ 
then he said, well, we got classified orders from 
Washington
 that you have to leave 
right away. And of course, I knew what it was all about, but I didn™t admit it. And so 

then the y shipped me t o

Q: Of that visit. 
A: Œ that. I ha Œ one thing I want to interject is that they had a poli c y then Œ when I 

finished basic traini ng, which was in Ma y of ™44, as I finished basic t raining, I 

became an American citizen. There was a policy there that the y woul dn™t send you Œ 

they couldn™t send you overseas, li ke 
Germany
 especially, if you weren™t an 
American cit izen, because if the Germans caught you, the y coul d stri ng you up, you 

know. Whi ch, I wi sh they had that policy now, because the y don™t do it. The y Œ 
t h e y 

have guys get who kill ed fighting for the 
United States
 t hat are not citizens, which 

is totally unacceptable in m y book. 

Q: So when did you go from 
Ho ckenheimer
 t o 
Hockley
? 
A: WhenI becamea ci tizen.
 
Q: And Œ 
A: And that was before the su Œ the super Œ 
Su
perior court, 
Cumberl a nd 
county, 
North Carolina
. And t here was an applicati on that I wanted to change m y name. 
Because m y nickname hadalwa ys been 
Rudy
, 
r-u-d-i 
or 
y
, depending where I was Œ 
I
 
initially, and 
Y
 in 
France
. The y Œ which they pronounce, 
Ru-
dee
(ph). And I 
decided, you know, I might as well  change m y name from 
Rudol f
.
 Martin 
was t he 
middle name, 
Martin Hockley
. I mean hock Œ 
Rudolf Martin Hockenheimer
 to Œ 
m y applicat ion was to 
Rudy Martin Hockley
. And the judge looked down over his 
glasses at me and said, we can™t have that. 
Rudy
 is a nickname. Take something

else. And j ust like that, out of Œ you know, like there was somethi ng up there, you 
know, I went like t his, and I said okay, call  me 
Ralph
. This how major steps are 
taken in life. But so I Œ in May of Œ of ™44, I became an American cit i zen. 

Q: Ah, with as Œ and now known as 
Ral ph
. 

A: 
Martin Hockley
. 
Q: 
Ralph 
mart
 Œ Martin Hockley
. Oka y
, di 
Œ how do friends call you now, 
Ral ph
,
 
Rudy
?  
A: Depends. Until I married this woman, I was 
Ralph
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: My first wife called me 
Ralph
.  
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But 
Caroline
 doesn™t like 
Ralph
, and women have the t endenc y of not liking 

what other women Œ what for-former wives wanted. And so she deci ded I wasn™t a 

Ralph
 
to her,and shecalls me 
Rudy
. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: I can™t pronounce either, so it doesn™t make any difference. 

Q: Oka y, so you™re a ci tizen. Ma y 1944, you™re a citizen. You get t hese classified 
orders, and you end up in 
Camp Ritchie
. Tell us, what is 
Camp Ritchie
? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016

A: 
Camp Ritchie
,
 Maryland
 was established, I believe in 1942, when the y found 
that the a
rm y in 
Œ i n 
E uro pe 
Œ of course, we hadn™t landed yet, but we were in 
North Afri ca
, that they Œ  that they needed linguists very bad. 
Do y
ou mind if I Œ I Œ 
I can lean m y leg down here. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: I Œ and so, the y developed this forum, cal-called the intelligence t raining center, 
Camp Ritchie
,
 Maryland
, which is 65 miles north of 
Washington
, and65 miles 

west of 
Balti more
. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: In the mountains up there. And they Œ 
t he y taught 
Œ well, languages you knew, 
but they had all kinds of odd characters there, from 
PhDs
 to privates l ike me. 
Anybody who knew any languages, they Œ 
they got there, andthe y trainedthem in 
such things as prisoner of war interrogation, just military intelligence analysis, order 
of battle. Order of battle is try to get complete records of the organi zation of the 

enemy mili tary, so that  if you knew that the second 
Panzer
 divisi on was coming at 

you, you knew that the commandi ng general had to be so and so, and you n Œ 
you 
built up records to know the weaknesses and t he strengths of the commanders, and 

things like that. And then the big one, prisoner of war interrogation was a very big 

one. They t he y Œ 
Q: Did you have training in all of those different topics? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
137
 
A: Not in all. Well, there™s some ge-generali zed yes, but specifically I was Œ wel l, 
they first started me in French. They decided, you know, that came first. 
Germany
 
was afterwards. So they trained me in French 
MII
, French Milit ary Intelligence 
Interrogation. And then the y Œ 
they shifted me to 
Œ when we didn™t need people in 
France
 any more, t he y shifted me to Œ to German. And they Œ and then they Œ 
they 
put me through Œ yeah, first they Œ when t he French was over, they put me in the 
aerial photo interpret ation, which didn™t make any sense, because t hat ™s not what  I 

was there for. And so t hen the y Œ t he y made me work in the officers™ mess for Œ after 

I graduated t he basic course, which is general in nature, t he y Œ they had me work in 

the officers™ mess for a few months. I™m very good at pot s and pans. And I Œ and 

then the y suddenly Œ somebody pushed a button and the y sa y oh, but he knows 

German. 
[indecipherable]
 So the y gave me a two week blitz course, we called it, in 
Œ in German interrogation stuff. 
Q: Was that  different than French? 

A: No. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But just Œ 

Q: It was i n German. 

A: It was i n German. And the y Œ you know, they had Œ 
the y had 
Œ  on the post the y 
had Œ I forget what t hey were called, but the y had an enem y force that the y had, that

wore German uniforms for the Œ us to recogni ze the uniforms, and the ranks and 
things like that. The aggressor, it was called. And so they had some exercises where 

we had to do certain things, the y Œ they al so send us out at night for a whole week, 

through 
Maryland
 and 
Pennsylvania
 pig farms, where if you went over the fence at 
night, you ste
pped on a pig, and then it ran away squealing. And Œ and they Œ the y 
gave us Œ t he y gave us a map, which was not in English, and the y made us find our 
way back, which was i nteresting. But, so there was general kind of training of what 

you might encount eri
n a combat si tuation. Then in Œ the y Œ I™ve Œ I stayed there 
forever, and March of ™45, which was two months before the end of the war, the y 

finall y shi pped us overseas, and Œ 

Q: Before we go there, a question at two different periods of time. Before you joi ned 

the arm y, you said you were Œ you were very engaged, and wanted to know what  
was going on, you Œ you know, your Œ your mi nd was over with t he people who 
were in 
Europe
, who were under threat, and who were suffering. And so, were Œ 

was there news of what was happening to the Jews? Was there re Œ were there 

reports of what was going on?  

A: Well, we knew what was going on, but the question of at what  poi nt we knew 

about death camps Œ 

Q: And deportations to them, yeah. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
139
 
A: Œ well, we knew about deportat ion, but not  necessarily that when t hey got there Œ 
I mean, there were Frenchmen, when the Œ in ™42, when the Germans took over all of 

France
, a lot of Frenchmen were shipped to Œ not Jew Œ  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Œ 
just Frenchmen 
Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ were shipped t o 
Germany
 for Œ to Œ labor forces. 
Q: Forced l abor. 

A: Forced l abor. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And the y were put i n the factories, and all kinds of places to carry out the Œ just 

about anything. So that was known, and there Œ there also was an element in 
France 
that cooperat ed with Œ with the Œ the Nazis, that the y had some ki nd of function, the 
[indecipherable]
 in 
France
, the y were not very nice people. But I cannot tell you of 
Œ I cannot tell you when exactly we learned about death camps. We knew all about 

concentration camps, and how bad the y were, and all that, but the angle of when it 

became really known t hat the y were gassing people, I Œ I Œ 
Ican™t tell  youfrom my 

personal knowledge. There Œ 
there were 
Œ  
Q: I mean li ke when you knew. I guess it™s when you knew. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
140
 
A: Yeah, well, we didn™t Œ we didn™t Œ wel l, we knew Œ we knew i n ™42, for 
example, at the latter part of ™42, that my Aunt 
Clara
(ph) and 
Annie
(ph), my cousin, 
were deported from 
G urs 
to Œ  
Q: Somewhere. 

A: Œ somewhere. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: But, the detail of where to, a
nd whatit was likethe
re, t hat the y were being killed, 

that, at that point, was not known. 

Q: In your training in 
Camp Ritchie
, was any kind of Œ you know, was any kind of 
news, from what was going on in 
Germany
, part of the training? News that you 
wouldn™t read in the ﬁ
New York Times
.ﬂ
 
A: I don™t think so. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Because the training was all from military. What do you do to defeat the German 

mil itary. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That was the focus. 

Q: Oka y. So let™s go back. Remind me again, when did you go over? When were 

you shipped over? 
A: In March of ™45. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
141
 
Q: Forty-five. All right , so two months le Œ are left of di Œ for the war. Where were 
you first sent? 

A: Well, the ship Œ the ship docked in 
Scotland
, and the y put Œ 
we were 
Œ went on 
the 
Î
le de France
, whi ch was the largest ship floating around, which outraced any 

submarine, so that we went without escort. And we never saw the ship until we got 
off it. It was so big, they made us go in the side of the hold in 
New York
, and you 
never saw where you are in this t hing. You couldn™t see the front or the back of it. 
But once we got off in Œ in 
Scotland
 Œ 
come back 
Œ then you coul d see the whole 

ship, and then they se Œ put us on the train, and the y took us to 
Southampton
, all  the 

way down to the bottom. And then the y took us over to 
France
. And in 
France
 
th ey 
first send us to some replacement depot for a short ti me. And then Œ
I was 
Œ I 
and my 
group of people, there were a few of us, were sent to a vi lla outsi de of 
Paris
, in 
Le 
Vésinet
, which was, for 
Euro pe
, the 
Œ the intelligence assignment  center. And I was 
Œ I was picked up from there by a colonel who was part of the staff of the 
Bremen 
port command. The y were planning to open the port of 
Bremerhaven
 for allied 

troops, when the war was over. And so that™s where that started. I was in 
Paris
 Œ I 

mean, you know, that™s not Œ that wasn™t my plan, but I was in 
Paris
 on Œ on eight 

Ma y, ™45 Œ 

Q: No kidding. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
142
 
A: Œ when the war ended, and you know Œ when the punishment for being in 
Paris 
on eight of May ™45, and you were in American uniform, and you wal ked down the 

Champs Élysée
, I got caught in a Œ it™s just funny Œ I got  caught in a circle of 

French women, wit h a lieutenant colonel of the air force, who was 23 years old, and 

the two of us could onl y escape after we kissed them 
all. I mean, whatduty 
Œ  
Q: Oh, what a puni shment. 

A: Œ what duty. But then i mmediat ely thereafter, I guide Œ I guided a bunch to go up 

to Œ to 
Bremen
, because I spoke French and German. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And that was the purpose of that exercise. 

Q: So was this the Œ when you went there, that™s the first time you™re back on 

German soil, for a decade. 
A: About Œ about 10 th Œ yeah, about Œ about a decade. Probably 11 years. I Œ 
I got 
there about the 10
th
 of May, ™45.  
Q: So, do you recal l any kind of feelings that were running through you at that ti me, 

or were there Œ was i t, I got a job, I™m gonna go do this job, and Œ 

A: Interesti ng question. I had feelings. I hated all Germans at the point Œ at that 

point. 
Germany
 was basically on its knees. It was 65 percent destroyed in most 
places, not i n all places, but we drove up t o 
Bremen
, all the wa y t hrough 
Germany
, 
west Œ 
West Germany
. And every city we came to was as flat as a pancake. In order 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

to get a truck to get through 
Kassel
, 
Germany
, you had to have a bulldozer in front 
of you to push the rubble aside, so that the truck could go through. And 
Bremen
 wa 
Œ we went to, was 65 percent destroyed. And t he Germans that were there, the y 
kicked them out of the houses, so the y could house us. And I don™t know where t he y 

went. Some Œ sometimes they stayed in the basement. But the Œ 
I 
Œ my motto was to 
keep my di stance. They had a fraternization Œ non-fraternization order that you 
couldn™t associate soci all y with 
G
.
I
.
s
, which didn™t last very long. The order last ed, 
but the f actual part of it  didn™t last  very long. And Œ but I personally, you know, 

there are a few things that happened that Œ 
or some 
Œ I was pretty well known, 
because every German that worked for us had to go ba Œ past me to get a security 

clearance, and se
-securit y pass. So everybody who worked for the Americans, knew 

me. And so they established a Œ we established for the 
G
.
I
.
s,
 you had t o do 
something, in their spare ti me, whatever that  was, the y established a club called the 
Sha ng ri
- La
, and Œ which was Œ and you were permitted t o take girls there, because 
they had music, you could dance. 

Q: But you can™t fraternize with them. 

A: Yeah. And I Œ I was approached there by Œ it wasn™t immediately, but a few 

months lat er by one young lady that knew me, and she came over t o m y table, and 

she said Œ I don™t know what she called me, Mr. 
Hockley
, or Corporal 
Hockley Œ
 I 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
144
 
was a corporal by then. The Œ I noticed that  you never sit with anybody el se except  
G
.
I
.
s
, and you don™t dance, and so on. 

Q: In other words, you don™t fraternize.  

A: And I said, look, I don™t want to discuss it. I Œ I Œ 
m y family 
Œ you know, there 
was the whole story, my family was treated very badly by the Germans, and I don™t Œ 
I don™t have to associate socially. And so she broke out i n tears. Then her boyfriend 
came over and Œ and chewed me out for making his girlfriend cry. But th Œ 
yo u 
know, every German you met in 1945 had a cousin in the 
United States
. 

Q: Is that so? 

A: The Œ that was t he way of getting Œ there are a lot of people that fraternized, all 

the wa y up the line. Not just the privates, and so on, the officers, too. It was a poli c y 

condemned to failure. But for me, it was fine. I didn™t go there to become friends 
with anybody. I was very fair in everything I did. I didn™t mistreat anybody, I just 
did my job, and that was it. But I didn™t want t o Œ there™s no wa y t hat I could soci ally 

be active wi th Germans, if I didn™t know who the y were. And that Œ  

Q: What was your j ob? Besa Œ you said you had to Œ 
A: Well 
Œ 
Q: Œ they had to clear Œ you were t he first point of security? 

A: Well, the first thing is the colonel Œ the colonel that pi cked me up was the fellow 
in charge of intelligence for the 
Bremen
 port command. So he was the 
G2
 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

intelligence officer, and I was on his staff. And the intelli gence office had to issue 
security passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters 

that was in the middle of town. The air force didn™t bomb it, so we™d have a nice 

place to stay. I™m sure that™s true, by the way, and Œ because everythi ng else was flat, 

except this wonderful building Œ i t became our headquarters. And so everybody that 
worked in t hat headquarters, because we needed German Œ we coul dn™t do 
everything ourselves, we needed cl erical staff, and so on. We, in our office, we had 

no German clerks, because it was security. But everybody else did. And so our office 

was Œ had t he job of Œ of getting them the passes. Since I was the only person in the 

office who spoke German, it™s Œ I was the contact guy. And the y also Œ they send me 

up to 
Bremerhaven
 for a couple weeks to Œ t o handle the security office at the Œ at 
the port up there. And I did that for, I would say until Oct ober, gi ve or take. And 
then, I had, at 
Ritchie
, I had the Œ 
Ritchie
 was a weird place. When you finished 
your cours
e 
Œ I was in the 24
th
 class, if that™s of any interest Œ that up to the 24
th
 
class, when you graduated from 
Ri tchie
, you 
Œ they either prom Œ 
they promoted 
you to corporal, sergeant, or second lieutenant . And the y promot ed me to nothing. 
Starting wi th the 
24
th
 class, no more promotions. So, what the y Œ they took some 
people, and Œ who wanted to be officers, and t hey sent them Œ the y send them to 

Fort Benning
,
 G eorgia
, on Œ to take the quick course, the 90 da y wonder Œ I don™t 
know if you ever heard that expression Œ t he Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
146
 
Q: I have something si milar, but I don™t remember it Œ t he Œ what it was called. It™s 
something Œ 

A: Yeah, 90 day wonder. The y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ the y t ake these guys, they send them to 
Fort 

Benning
, make them i nfantry officers in 90 days, which usually it took six months, 
or whatever. And so you could go from 
Ritchi e
 to 
Benning
 
to become 
a 
90 da y 
wonder, and then come back as a second lieutenant, they had that, too. Wi th the 24
th
 
class, because of the Œ how far the war had progressed, t he y didn™t do that any more. 

So I went in the war as a private. But then, once I was over there, they Œ the y Œ 
wel
l, 
they promoted me to corporal, and I Œ I had al so applied at 
Ritchie
 to join the 

counter-intelligence corps, because that™s what I wanted. I wanted to catch Nazis. 

That™s what the y were doing. But  the y told me I was too young, so I didn™t get into 

the 
CIC
, you had t o be older. But then, once I was in 
Bremen
, and I applied again to 
get into the counter-int elligence corps, and they accepted me. So, i n t he last six 

months I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps, 

no insignia of rank, just two 
U
.
S
.
s
, so that you could go to see some colonel, and 
chew hi m about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without  him knowing 

what your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, the y knew that you 

weren™t a general. So, I sa Œ I Œ I did that. And it™s actually as a result of that, that I Œ 

ultimately when I was in 
Syracuse 
University, I got a commission military 
intelligence, because the gentleman that Œ before I left, when m y ti me wa Œ 
came t o 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

go home, I was interviewed by a colonel from intelligence headquarters in the 
States
, asked me if I wouldn™t stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer. And I said 

no, I Œ I Œ I™d like to, but I Œ I Œ I want to go t o college, I got to finish college, that™s 

m y first thing. But when I was at 
Syracuse 
in ™48, I got a letter from t he same 
colonel, he didn™t know the c Œ the con Œ 
the connection, buthe said,we™re 
interested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, milit ary i ntelligence 

reserve, and he gave m e the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant, 

when I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote hi m 

back and I sa y, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I™m only a sergeant, I™m not a staff 

sergeant, so I don™t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whet her you thi nk 

that I am qualified, if you™re the same Colonel  
Stev ens
 t hat came to 
Bremen
,
 
Germany
 and interviewed me in ™46, and ask ed me to accept a commi ssion, t hen 
you must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn™t have interviewed me. 

And he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I™m the same guy, you™ll 

hear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwri tten note from 

hi m, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so. I did, and within six 

months I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve.  

Q: I see. I see, so that™s Œ that™s the progression of Œ of your career, and Œ and Œ and 

going up i n rank. 
A: Yeah.

Q: Let™s go back st ill t o 
Bremerhaven
. Did you take part in any denazification 
processes?  

A: Oh yeah. It was lots of fun. 

Q: Tell me, what was i nvolved with that? 

A: Well, they Œ 
they had 
Œ they had the alli es put out a Œ an order at the end of the 
war, they Œ they had Œ first of all, they had an automatic arrest category, that meant if 
a German, a Nazi was more than somethi ng i n the Nazi movement, i t required that if 

you found hi m, that you arrest hi m. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And Œ 
an
d then they had a category of the next ones down were Œ 
t hey couldn™t 
get certain jobs. And then you do Œ there were the ones that you exonerated, and so 

the 
CIC
 had the job of denazification. They had to Œ the y got all t he records of 
people who applied for Œ for something, or that came across our Œ for one thing, 
across our path, and they had to have them fill out the famous 
fragebogen
, which 
every German had to fill out, in which he said, you know, where he had been, when, 

where he went to school, did he join the Nazi party, didn™t he join the Nazi party, 

and etcetera.
 
Q: And did most of them ever, never join t he Nazi party 
[indeci phera ble]
 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
149
 
A: Well, most of them joined the Nazi party, but the y were uni mportant. They were 
not functionaries, t he y were just members, because they had to maintain their job, or 

something. There™s some truth to that. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: A Œ 
a 
Œ if you wanted to be a teacher, probably, you had to be a member of the 
party. Now, that da Œ 
didn™t mean how 
Œ how active you were or not, you just Œ it 
was just a ticket that you had to punch. There are people who never di d it, and 
survived, but it just depended how much they Œ they trusted the system, or the y 

needed to eat . So the y were not all Œ if the y joined the Nazi party, they Œ  we 

determined they weren™t all bad people. We Œ we found all kinds of people, you 

know, it Œ it Œ you never quite knew what was going to hit you next. There are two 

things I mi ght mention, wi Œ part of that period. I Œ the y Œ m y office was right next 
to the jail t here, we had a jail, American jail . And Œ which a friend of mine was t he 
commandant. And so I Œ I went to that jail all t he time, to interrogate people. And 

somebody brought  to m y attention that t here was a guy Œ denunciati on was the order 

of the day. I devised my own questionnaire, and then I made people fill out that were 
brought int o m y office. And I made them fill t hat out before I would t alk to them. 

And the first question was, what™s your name, date of birth, and profession. And who 

Œ who do you want to t alk to me about? And if the guy was a butcher, and he wanted

to talk to me about a butcher, I knew that he was trying to get the competition out of 
the wa y. 

Q: That™s Œ  
that™s very clever, you know,becausedidn™t 
Œ it™s an ugly t hing Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ denunciation. It Œ  
A: Oh yeah, it Œ it was a big deal. Because people had not hing, so they Œ  they used 

denunciation in order t o get themselves in a better positi on. So Œ but there was this 

one guy, I found out Œ you know, I Œ I was gi ven a tip, there was a guy who was 

there, and he was Œ had the rank of so and so, which made hi m part of your 

automatic arrest category. And so Œ but then Œ then I Œ yeah, so I Œ he had just been 

released from our prison. So I figured out that the y didn™t know who he was, so the y 

released hi m. So, I deci ded to arrest  him. But being a nice guy, I decided that he™d 
been in jail for, I don™t know how long, and he was spending the night  with his 
girlfriend, so I decided, well, let hi m have one night, and a Œ they had a curfew, from 

si Œ 10 in the Œ 10 in the evening ti l six in the morning. So I Œ we didn™t do the 

arresting ourselves, we charged the German police with that. So I gave orders to 

have hi m arrested at 5: 30. And Œ and the y brought hi m t o the prison, and then they 

brought him over t o my office. And in the meantime I found out Œ I didn™t find out at 

first, but I found out that he had Œ we had had hi m, and we released him. And I sa y, 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
151
 
well, there™s somet hing wrong here. So I Œ I said to myself, how do I address this? 
We released him 
yesterday, and Œ 
Q: We™re re-
arresting him now.
 
A: Œ we™re re-arresting hi m. And so, when he came in m y office, I mean, I never 

forgot this, because up to this poi nt, nobody had ever said to me that the y had been a 
Nazi of any consequence. And thi s guy, when he walked i n, he sat down in m y 
office. The first question I ask him Œ don™t ask me why, I Œ you know, you do thi ngs 

in life, you don™t know why you do them. You think you know why you do them. I 

said to hi m, until when were you a Nazi? I did this because of the information I had 

in front of me. And his answer was, oh, I™m sti ll a Nazi. And I have to tell you, I 

almost fell off my chair, because nobody had ever said the y were a Nazi, you know? 

And so I said, oh, I said to myself, well t hat™s interesting, I gotta Œ thi s one I want to 
hear. And he was there, I had hi m i n there about two, three hours. I just wanted t o Œ I 
wanted to figure thi s out, what Œ what™s t he deal? And he told me, you know, I can 

spare you t he details, but he told me that Œ that hitl Œ what 
Hitler
 wanted for 

Germany
 was i mportant because the Germans needed a leader, the y needed a 
fuehrer to lead them, et cetera, but he made mi stakes, like he should never have 

touched the Jews, and a few other things l ike that, and Œ but, in principle he still  be-

believed in the philosophical principle of the fuehrer, the leader running the country, 
the people don™t know, otherwise, what to do. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

Q: The y need a strong hand. 
A: And so, I finally, you know, I remanded him t o prison, because it said on paper 

that I had to, but Œ 

Q: Did you learn anyt hing from him? 

A: Oh yeah, I th Œ I learned a lot from hi m. That there™s one person in 
Germany
 that 
was honest . There were others who were. And then, I mentioned before that the Œ the 

thing, the other thi ng that I found fascinating is that we Œ we were i nvolved in Œ 
you 
know, there were all ki nds of stories about there are still Nazis around, and we have 

to watch them, you can™t Œ you know, if you drive down t he street in a 
Jeep
, they™re 
liable to shoot at you, or kill you, or put up a wire. The Œ I don™t know whether you 

even noticed, but the 
Jeeps
 all had a Œ a metal  rod in the front of the Œ of the hood, 
and if you were driving down the street, if somebody put a wire across the street, t he 
Œ this thing woul d cut t he wire, so it wouldn™t kill you. Otherwise, because you 
couldn™t put the roof down, the darn thing would decapitate you. And so the y Œ they 

Œ 

Q: Were there such i nst ances?  

A: If there were, the y were so far, that Œ 
you know.
 
Q: But this was anticipation. I
n case.
 
A: Prep Œ you have to be prepared Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: Œ for anything. But I Œ 
Ihad my own 
Jeep
, and I drove around everywhere, I 
never Œ never was worried about somebody doing anythi ng nasty to me. They Œ 
they 
Œ there Œ so there was t he story that the 
Hi tler
 youth Œ and this was, I think, inquiry, 
investigati on, that the 
Hitler
 yout h still had a hard core of 
Hitler
 youth, who were 
waiting for the moment to Œ and you talked about we
rewolves. Well, we 
Œ we got a 
tip that there was a Œ in Œ in our area, there was a farmhouse which was headquart ers 

for these guys. 

Q: So the y Œ known that the y were called the werewolves, or something? 

A: Well, that™s what the legend call ed them. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: And I™ll  tell you a few words about that , in a Œ afterwards, we™ll Œ so we went out 
there, and we Œ because the Germans kept such good records, you know, we went to 
the Œ to thi s farmhouse to arrest some of these guys. Well, there was onl y one guy 
there. And so we went through the farmhouse, but we found all t he records of the 

Hitler
 yout h for the whole northern 
Germany
, and we, of course, took them with us. 
And we left the guy alone, we figured he Œ wit h the Œ we had gotten enough out of 

this deal. And ba Œ the bottom line was, there was no resi stance to speak of. Thes
e 

were guys who were dreamers, and the y had been set up, you know, before 
Hitler
 

collapsed, t he y say well, when Œ if we give up, we will fight to the end, you know, 
but there was nobody t o fight to the end. We totally dis Œ if there was anything

strong, we disarmed them, and that was the end of that. I™m sa ying thi s because it™s 
very interesting toda y, because S
ecretary 
Rice
 Œ what™s her first name? 
Condoleezza 
Rice
 
made a famous speech
, 
Iraq
 connection, that the Œ t hat the terrorists in 
Iraq
 
were just li ke the werewolves in 
Germany
. And I had that thrown at me at a couple 
of conferences I attended, or gave, and Œ and you know, I never make anybody feel 
bad in public, but I went to color Œ to 
Camp Carson
,
 Colorado
, and some si Œ 
command sergeant major just back from 
Iraq
 made this speech, and yes, there Œ 
there are the Œ the Œ the Œ the terrori sts in 
Iraq
 is like the werewol ves i n 
Germany
, 
and when it  was over, I took hi m aside and sai d, look, Command Sergeant Major, 

there were no werewolves in 
Germany
. I can tell you, I was there, and I was 
involved i n this. And t here was a co Œ 
mari ne colonelata meeting in 
Houston
, came 
up with the werewolves, the Œ the guys in 
Iraq
 being like the werewolves, and I 
said, it™s just Œ let me stand up here and tell  you, it™s a damn lie. There were no 

werewolves in 
Germany
. I have the only book that was ever written about the 
werewolves. There was one guy, who killed the mayor of 
Aachen
, 
G ermany
, in Œ 
before the war was over, and he was called a werewolf. And after that, there were no 

werewolves. So it™s a Œ it™s a legend, that t his existed. So, I™m st ill ali ve to tell that 

the history is being misused. 

Q: But a fascinating footnote, because it would be something that, you know, is a 
logical question. The war is just lost, this had been such a powerful enem y, a 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

155
 
thorough enemy, and a ruthless enem y. And Œ and one could expect resistance. It 
wouldn™t be out of the real ms of, you know, possibility. 

A: 
Germany
 was so destroyed. They were Œ t he people had nothing t o eat, the 
survival was the only t hing that they had going for them. And the women were made 

to clean up all the Œ 
Q: The rubble. 
A: Œ the rubble. The 
trümmerfrauen
, and the rubble, and the y Œ just to exist, was a 

burden. So you know, i t kind of Œ 

Q: You have Œ you know, you Œ I™m going to step aside a little bit here. I mean, you 

have a history and experience that i s so uni que, with German Jews, who escaped, 

left, fled. You know, whatever verb we would choose, who left 
Germany
, and then 
came back. There are some, but very few, who came back to have such thorough 
knowledge of the country in their postwar years. Yours starts now, right after Worl d 
War II, but t hen later goes on to have a Œ 
a career in 
Œ in intelligence with the 

Americans, for several decades. What did Œ what did you learn in those decades? I 

mean, there has to be a process, through which a Œ a human being goes, when they Œ 

and Œ or they see someone the y love, like t hei r father, who suffered so much from 

the hands of a system, that was adopted by a country. Was there a ti me in this 

process where your feelings and your thoughts about 
Germany
 changed? 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
156
 
A: Well, m y initialreaction 
Œ initial initial, in 
Bremen
, was exemplified by the 
following; I walked down the street in 
Bremen
 one day, and there was a man 
beating his kid. And I was in American uniform. And I walked up to him and said, 

stop it. We™re bringing democrac y t o you, i n a democrac y you don™t beat your kid on 

the street. That was m y immediate reaction. How do you get to t he Germans? How 
do you get them awa y from this business of Œ of punishment, of Œ of beating, of 
harshness, and so on? So, all I could do at that moment was that. Gradually, the 

young generation, you Œ you know, there Œ you had to wait for a while. 
Germany
 
was rebuilt amazingly fast, thanks to the 
Marshall Plan
, and many other things. And 
the Germans are, undoubtedly, very astute, and Œ what™s the word I™m t rying to think 

of Œ people. They Œ  they work very hard, to this day. There are always exceptions, 

but generally speaking. The y™re wel l organized, the y Œ the y keep their nose to the 
grindstone, and Œ and they were lucky with the initial governments t hey got, you Œ 
you 
know, when you get a 
Ko nrad Adena uer
, who was no pansy, who Œ who Œ 
who ran 
Germany
 pret ty harshly, but that  built everything up, and then he was 
followed by 
Erhard
 to fix the econom y, and t hen of course, you had 
Willy Brandt
, 
who was a socialist , and brought a lot of social things to 
Germany
. They Œ 
they had 
some very good leaders. I can™t thi nk of one chancellor of 
Germany
 that was real ly 
bad. They had a couple of presidents, but presi dents don™t  matter. They™re Œ the y 
were figureheads, like the queen of 
England
. It™s the chancellors who run the show. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

So, gradual ly the young generations there, they went through all kinds of stuff. The 
universities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students 

got pretty left-wingish. But gradual ly, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is 

like to be in democracy, and what Œ what happened is the y Œ they Œ because there™s 
been such a tremendous change in the wa y the world operates, that all the y want Œ 
the young people want to do is go Œ come to 
America
, or 
France
, or Œ you know, 
they been Œ they were locked up in 
Germany
, they couldn™t get out of 
Germany
, 
under 
Hitler
. And so it Œ suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and the y saw 
that there were other societies, that weren™t as bad as the y were made out to be. And 
the people went to 
Brittany
 on vacation, i nstead of staying in 
Germany
, saw that it 
was nice in 
Brittany
, or wherever they went . Half of 
Germany
™
s
 been to Œ to the 
Canary Islands
, and t o 
Spa in
, because 
Œ because they love the sun, pri marily, but 
that™s another Œ another world down there. So they Œ the y Œ they passed a 

constitution, which is very democrac y orient ed, and the y have a Supreme Court that 

is enforcing it. And it™s not alwa ys to our liking, but it doesn™t have to be. I Œ I 

alwa ys try t o take people for who Œ the individual qualities, and what the y were like, 

and their Œ I said, I met a lot of nice people. There are a lot of nice people in 
Germany
. There are certain things that Œ at Œ at m y farewell party, by t he German Œ 
by the 
BND
, the German 
CIA
. 
Q: 
BND
? Can you tell me what that is in German?

A:

.  
Q: Oka y. 
A: It was Œ  the Americans, basically, established it. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: The Œ I was asked the question, woul d you consider ret iring in 
Germany
?  And Œ 
and you know, I di dn™t want to be impolite, so I thought about it for 10 seconds, and 

I said, no, I Œ no, I would not retire in 
Germany
. I said, I will visit 
Germany
 and 
France
, which are m y mai n two countries of interest, as frequently as possible, but I 

w Œ I Œ I™m a citizen of the 
United States
, and as a citizen of 
United States
, I only 

feel free, totall y free, in the 
United States
. For example, in 
Germany
, if you™re a 
foreigner, you have to have Œ you have to go t o the 
Einwohnermeldeamt
, which is 
a registry office, you had to Œ well , you have t o let them know where you are. In t he 
u Œ in Œ in 
Germany
 and 
France
, you may notb
e able to get employment, because 
they are prot ecting the young people from the old people, and the y Œ 
t h ey 
Œ they Œ as 
a matter of fact, they ki ck you out of work when you™re 50 or something, so that  you 
have Œ they have jobs for the young people. So, in the 
United States
, there™s only 

one thing t hat can keep you Œ that the y can go after you for. It™s that Œ you can have 

five jobs at the same time, as long as you pa y your income tax, you™re always Œ 

you™re home free. That ™s the only thing they™ll ever get after you. No police

authority is going to go after you for anythi ng else, except t hat. And Œ and I Œ 
for me 
to live, I need that freedom. And so they were satisfied, I hope.  

Q: It™s a very diplom Œ it is a very diplomatic answer, you know?  
A: Yeah, you Œ you know. There are good people everywhere. I know some good 

people everywhere. I know some bad people everywhere too, but Œ  
Q: But from that I extrapolate that Œ that despite your deep knowledge, there was 

still something al wa ys there Œ no, this is not my 
place any more.
 
This is 
Œ  
A: I don™t think it ever was, but Œ because as a kid, as a small kid, you don™t know 

where Œ you know. 

Q: Yeah. Could it Œ hang on a second. Now, how Œ I want to turn the question 

around a lit tle bit. Have you met other German Jews who left 
Germany
, and never 
went back, because t hey wouldn™t go back. It™s a choice. And, have you shared with 
them what you thi nk, or what you learned when you were there in the post-war 
years? Or, let me put it this wa y, what would you tell such people, about the 

Germany
 you came to know? 
A: Well, one of the things I came t a Œ would tell them is that, of course, my situation 

was different, because Œ because I was there as a 
United States
 government 
representative. I did not live in 
Germany
 as an American living i n 
G ermany
, I lived 
in 
Germany
 as a government representative of the 
United States
. And so, all of my 
relations were based on that. If a policeman would stop me on the street, there™s 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
160
 
nothing he could do to me, because I had a semi-diplomatic passport . The y have a 
status between the private passport, and the di plomatic passport, and it™s Œ it™s called 

a official passport? Do you remember what  it™s called? Official passport. And I had 

one of those. And you know, therefore I never f Œ I was never dependent on the 

German economy. I used it, but I was never dependent on it. 
Q: There™s a difference there. 
A: We got Œ we Œ we went to 
PX
, the commi ssary, to go shopping. That didn™t mean 
we couldn™t go to German stores, and we did. But I was never Œ I was never in t he 

position that a person would have been who was not wi th the government, who was 

a German Jew, and went back a-as a private person, and 
re
integrat ed in a German 
system. I was not dependent on the German health system, the German anything. So, 

you know, to answer you Œ the first part of your question, I know a l ot of people who 
never went back. I al so know some people who went back and liked i t, but the y were 
there only as visitors, and some people who said the y wouldn™t Œ 
[phone ringi ng]
 
Q: Let™s cut . 
[break]
 Okay, who Œ 
A: The Œ the Œ lot of people that said they would never go back. My Uncle 
Charlie 

Heiman
(ph), he di d go back, because he had l ots of friends there, and he liked t o go 

in 
Munich 
to have a sausage and a Œ and a beer, and you know, so he went back, but 

just as a tourist, and to see old p Œ go to t he cemet ery. Lot  of people have gone back 
to take care of the cem eteries, of their parents, or family, whatever. I Œ oh, on Œ I Œ

you might want to check this out. I have a cousin Œ I had a cousin, who died wit hin 
the last few months. Her name is 
Ruth H o ckl ey
. 
Ruth Hockley
 
was marriedto my 
cousin 
Frank
, who was one of my first cousins, and 
Ruth Hockley
 is the only 
person that I™ve ever known, who spent t he entire war in ger Œ in 
Berlin
, and 

survived. And she™s been interviewed by t he Œ her son told me that she™s been 
interviewed by you. And Œ and she must have a Œ it might be an i nteresting story, 
because there are very few people who survived. Her mot her™s name was 

Heynemann
, 
h-e-y -n- e-m- a Œ 
double 
n
. That™s her maiden name. And so Œ but she 
never went back. I mean, having spent the entire war in 
Berlin
, that was enough for 

anybody. So there Œ there are a few people, a handful of people who survived. I Œ 

she™s the only one I™ve 
ever
 known that Œ t hat did. And I Œ I asked her son recently, 
after she passed away, I said, the Œ is there a st ory, what™s the story, you know, how 
did she survive? And she was interviewed by the Holocaust Museum, and he doesn™t 
know the answer, but you apparently have t he answer somewhere. It would be nice 

to Œ to know that story. It Œ it sheds some light as how Œ but she never went back. 
Q: Well see, the Œ m y question is a post-war question, i t™s a question of Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ of Œ I™m very glad you made the disti ncti on that 
when you were there, you were 

a representative of the 
U

A: Yeah.

Q: And I was going at it from the point of view that in t hat position, you had such an 
opportunity to learn more than the average person woul d, about this country, from a 

very wide perspective. So Œ 

A: I went Œ  I went occasionally Œ I went occasionally to a German synagogue. 

Q: Did you become reli gious at any ti me? 
A: No. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: My son 
Clifford
 was Bar Mitzvah in 
Bonn
. We first went Œ we were from 
Alameda 
ca
l Œ 
from 
Al ameda
 county, from 
O akland
,
 California
, and we went t o 
Oakland
 and sa y, can we arrange for hi m to be Bar Mitzvah? And my wife was 
reasonably religious. Not overly religious, but ch Œ and the y gave her such a hard 

time Œ oh, you have to do this, you have to do that, and you know, I finally said, 
yeah, I guess you guys don™t want us in 
Oakland
,
 California
. The y couldn™t be 
bothered, in the synagogue where she and I got married. And so I said well, we™ll do 
it in 
Bonn
, it™ll be a great favor to them. Because there™s hardly anybody in 

Germany
 who is Bar Mitzvah any more. As a matter of fact, in the year that he was 
Bar Mitzvah, there were only two;  him, and the son of the Israeli ambassador, and 

that was it. And so it was a big deal. And t his l ady was there. We were neighbors, we 

lived in the same apart ment house at the embassy, and the y had j ust moved in

recently, and we inv ited her to Œ t o come to this, since she was a neighbor. But, the Œ 
they have Œ the German government has put a lot of mone y into reviving religi ous Œ  
Q: Right. 

A: Œ opportunities for people, but not too many of them take advantage of it. The old 

people do, but there™s not that much of a Œ there are not enough peopl e around, you 
know. 
Q: Well, I t hink that we™ve come to pretty much the end of our interview, but it Œ 

before we end it, I would like to ask you a Œ sort of like a general question; is t here 

something that you thi nk we ought to know, t hat we haven™t covered? Something 

that you would want, you know, your interview to contai n, for others to also find that 

Œ find out about? 

A: Nothing comes to mind, just Œ 
Q: I know. I know, it™s Œ 
A: Œ it™s Œ it™s a Œ we™ve covered the, you know, the Œ the odyssey. 
Q: And we haven™t covered even so much of your Œ of your life. 

A: Yeah. The Œ the Œ 
there are 
Œ there have been Œ 
Germany
, the Œ the so-called 
Bundesrepublik Deutschla nd
, the Federal Republic of 
Germany
, which is now Œ 
Q: All of 
Germany
. 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

164
 
A: Œ all of 
Germany
, and was, for a long ti me, only 
West Germany
. The y™ve made 
a tremendous effort to Œ to Œ generally speaki ng, to atone, if you wish, for what the y 
did to mill ions of people. Jews, but not only Jews. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: A lot of others. And there are really not enough peopl e left. You™re going through 
this c ycle ri ght now where Mrs. 
Merkel
 is l etti ng in a million refugees, which my 
analysis would tell  me that 
it™sa mistake. But she 
Œ she Œ  it is bigger than what she 
predicted. She did i t in the spirit of Œ of making up for 
Germany
™
s
 name in the past. 
Of course, she was born in 
East Germany
, and she didn™t come t o 
G ermany
 until 
after the wall came down, and it became one 
Germany
. She™s probably very good at 
her job, but  in this case, I would, as a former i ntelligence official, I would sa y that 
taking in a million Muslims, or foreigners Œ doesn™t have t o be Musli ms Œ at one 
time, is something whi ch a democrac y can™t handle. It™s just sheer numbers. You 
have to be able Œ 
you 
Œ if you charge your Œ your security officials, 
counterintel ligence officials, with keeping the country safe, you can™t expect them to 

handle a hundred thousand people at once. You know, it™s just Œ it™s an 

overwhelmi ng task. If you do it slowly, that™s a different thing. And so, I think t hat Œ 

and this could co-
cost her 
Œ her Œ her Œ her chancellorship, cause she™s running 
again. But there™s enough people in 
Germany
 who feel that Œ who feel endangered. 
Because when that many people come in, you don™t know who t he y are. And Œ and

that™s Œ so Œ but you know, the fact that they are that welcoming to so many peopl
e 
has to be, at  least philosophically be taken as a plus, not a minus from t he Œ 
you 
know, the y™re Œ the y™re not Œ the y™re trying to be nice people. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The y™re t rying t o be humane, and Œ 
but, youknow, y
ou Œ you can Œ 
when you 
think about the Nazi period, you™ve got to come to the conclusion that  it™s very hard 

to visualize that that many people participat ed in so many nasty things, period. That 

Œ you know, their Œ I mean, you couldn™t have had concentration cam ps without  

concentration camp guards. There are doctors who participated in medical 

experiments, which were deadly to people. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Just to test them. Who Œ who Œ where do the Œ these people come from? Is it 
possible Œ this is alwa ys the question, is i t possible in the 
United States
? And 
you 
know, I used to sa y it wasn™t, but  there are Œ t here are bad people, whatever that 
means, people who have no conscience, in every country. I used t o say that it used to 

be that 10 percent are far right, 10 percent are far left, and the other 80 percent try to 

get along. I hope the figures never get any higher than that . I am not sure of that. 

Q: Well, someti mes it i s Œ if the 10 percent  on the far right, or far left sta y on those 

margins, and never come to power. 
A: Right, but Œ

Q:Because minorit ies c
an Œ  
A: Œ I wou Œ I would say this thing, I must say this thing. In 
Germany
, in 19 Œ seven 
Œ in the 1970s, the y had an organization known as the 
Baader-Meinhof Gang
. You 
probably remember them, you were there. The 
Baader-
Meinhof Gang
 was very 

dangerous, an
d when people talk about terrorists in the 
Middle East
, for example, I 
always Œ m y answer al ways is, look, 
Germany
 
is a very well organized country, 
from the point of view of police, and securi ty services. My guess is Œ  I didn™t count 

them individually, but m y guess i s, because I was involved in it, that there were 

about 30 members in the 
Baader-
Meinho f Gang
. The y were absolute nuts. You Œ I 
read their manifesto, I didn™t understand a word of it. I mean, the y were so wa y out, 

you know, it didn™t make any sense. The y killed people. They kill ed bankers, the y 

tried to kill  the commander of the American forces in 
Euro pe
 with a mortar shell, 
when he went to work i n the morni ng. The y, for the sake of Œ were they 
Nihilists
? I 
don™t know. The y were Œ the y were crackpot s. But it took the German intelligence 

services approxi mat ely 10 years to catch Œ cat ch them one by one. Ten years for 30 

guys. If you assume that in the 
Middle East
, you have one-tenth of one percent of 

bad guys Œ 
Iraq 
was 27 million, that™s 27,000. You™ll never find them all 27,000, 
especially when the y™re

A: Œ to do the same. So anyway, that™s from an analysis of the world as it is. The 
Germans got them, but it took them a long ti me. One by one. 

Q: Mr. 
Hockley

A: You™re welcome. 

Q: Thank you very, very much. 
A: I hope I haven™t worn you out.

Carrollton

. We are 
Œ thi s is January 12
th
, 2016, conti nuing his oral 
history, thi s is the donation of materials to the museum™s archives. Before we get to 

the actual donation mat erials, I did want to ask Mr. 
Hockley 
to talk a little bit about 

this photograph. This is a Œ a printout of a blown-up photograph. There™s actually a 
third photograph t hat goes here, and I didn™t have that. But I want ed t o give hi m the 
opportunity to talk about anybody in the phot ograph, thi s is from the Quaker staff in
 

France
, in 1940, correct? I just wanted to give him the chance to t al k about people. 

All the names are identified in his book, so we don™t have to identify everyone, but 

there are a couple of people that I know that you had mentioned t o me, in passing, 

and I wanted to make sure that were Œ were recorded. First off, this is you, correct? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Do you remember when this photograph was taken? 
A: Well, it had to have been taken at  the turn Œ at the turn of 1940 to ™41. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Give or take a mont h. December, January, something like that .

Q: Oka y. Was this Œ was it one op Œ one room, and this is just Œ was i n that room? 
A: Yes. 

Q: This Œ t his is a very Œ 

A: It was a big room. 

Q: Œ big room, oka y. Now, was this a m Œ 
cent ral meeting thateverybody
 came in? 
Cause I thi nk there are some peopl e who didn™t work in the 
Marseilles
 offices. 

A: I think what it was, is that this 
James Vale
(ph), and Mr. 
Evans
, I believe Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ were visiting from the 
United States
, and they brought everybody t ogether to 
meet with them, conference with them, etcetera. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s got to be close to what happened. 
Q: That would Œ 
t hatwould make sense.
 
A: Otherwi se there was no reason for everybody being there. 
Q: Mm-hm, okay. Now, just a couple people, just to Œ to highlight specificall y. 

Howard Kirschner
. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Is behind you i n the middle. 

A: Yep. 
Q: So he was Œ 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley

A: And his wife Œ 
Q: And his wife, 
Gertrude
.  
A: Œ in front of hi m. 

Q: Yeah. And then, you talked about hi m a bit during the Œ the oral history, so we 

don™t give them the history. Was t here anyt hing else that you wanted to Œ 
to mention 
about him, and his work? Your impressions of him? 
A: He was a very serious person. He didn™t smile too often. That ™s what I mean by 

serious. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: He was a man on 
a mission
. He was afraid of nobody. He went to see 
Marshal 

Pétain
 several ti mes, to plead for the children of Œ under his tutelage, if you wish. 

He didn™t take no for an answer, he was not afraid of authority. He was an Ameri can, 
he was a wealthy American, and Œ t hough he li ved very Spartan life. To s Œ 
underline that, he never drank coffee, he didn™t  drink tea, he didn™t  dri nk anything 

like 
Coke
. My mother occasionally wouldcome inintheafternoon and 
Œ 
and make 
hot water for him, with sugar. He would h ave, in the afternoon, a cup or two of hot 

wat Œ hot water wit h sugar, and he would have a piece of toast wit h it, that m y 

mother prepared for him. And he got to be 98, I think, and for years I didn™t drink 

any coffee, because if 
Howard Kirschner 
got to be 98 by that kind of a diet Œ they 
did not eat rich food, of any kind, he and his wife. He was a Œ as I said, the best way 

 
Interview with Ralph Hockley  
 
January 12, 2016 
 
 
 
171
 
to say it is, he was a man with a mission, 
and he 
had he had a large st aff all over 
Euro pe
. He had to keep track of many operations, and from what  I could see as a 
kid, he did it with great  flair and ability, and Œ and dedication, would be the word. I 
saw hi m a number of times, years l ater, when he was not Œ I Œ I believe he ma y have 

had a falling out wi th t he Quakers. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: On Œ o n authori ty, or something. Whet her t his had anyt hing t o do with it, I don™t 

know, but he Œ when I saw hi m in later years, he was a Œ working for religious, 

philosophical organizat ions, and Œ but he was alwa ys doi ng good things for other 

people. 

Q: Was there anyone else in particular that you wanted to Œ  

A: Well, the Œ the Œ 
Q: Œ highli ght? Again, I™m missing the last Œ t he s Œ the side where 
B urns Chalmers 
on that I™m Œ I™m actually missing from the photograph. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But it i s in the book. 

A: This was Mr.
 
W eems

Q: Keep that separate from this pi cture. 

A: Do you have that?  
Q: We have it digitally, we don™t have the original. 
A: Oka y. 

Q: You mentioned earl ier there was somebody who functioned as like a bodyguard? 

A: Yeah, well, he was Œ 
that™s m y percepti on.
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: This guy, 
Alberto

would drive us around. And in thi s picture here Œ in this picture, which is in the 
book, this is hi m. And so I went out with Mrs. 
Loissen
(ph), to deliver food to the 
sisters, and you can tell  I wasn™t over-nouri shed. He was always t here, always 

keeping an e ye that I was okay. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: That was not a function of his, that was his personal Œ 
personal mission.
 
Q: How often did you t ravel to Œ for distri butions like that? 
A: Not 
very often.
 

Q: Oka y. 

A: You know what it had to do wi th? This was Mrs. 
Loisson
(ph). The reason I™m 
there, is for k Œ because I spoke French. 

Q: Ah, oka y. 
A: And the sisters Œ the sisters only spoke French, so Œ

A: Œ so when somebody got in that situation, t hey sa y oh, we™ll take 
Rud

Quakers didn™t pay me, but the y had food that the y gave out. And every once in a 
while the y Œ they woul d give me a piece of Swiss cheese about this big, to take 

home, or a big cont ainer of honey. Stuff that had some good, strong nutrients in 

them, and Œ which was worth a Œ more than anything you could buy in the store, 
which didn™t have i n the first place, but 
Bli ckenstaff
 
was nice.
 
These la 
Œ I knew 
them all, but I Œ thi s is Miss 
Leaven
(ph). She was a very effective lady. This is Mrs. 
Burnell
(ph). She is the wife of Œ of him. And this guy™s name is 
Benjamin

he was the financial guy. I think he was Jewish, as a matter of fact. 

Q: I know the y had people from across 
Europe

an
d 
Ireland
, and 
Norway
, and 
like yousaid, many Americans 
[indecipherable]
 
fo
r them. 
A: I mean, t he y Œ 
t h e y 
Œ they did stuff. Everything the y did was legal , but the y 
obviously, some of them Œ and you never knew who, but some of them, in order to 
do what the y had t o do, they had to make side agreements with Œ 
j ust like 
Œ like 
Varian Fry
. You know, he Œ he™d go down and negotiat e a deal with the guy who 
owned the boat, in order to get somebody from point 
A 
to point 
B
, you had to take 
certain steps Œ and I™m sure there were a few people in there that 
the wordlegal was 
Œ I mean, what did it mean in occupied 
France
, or in Œ in 
Vichy
,
 
France
,if you had 
to reach a certain goal, you had to do what  it took to get to the goal, which didn™t 

make it not illegal, but on a margin, you know. It™s like 
Hiram Bingham
 meeti ng

with

Chagall
 or somebody out of Œ out of 
France
, you know, that was these side deal s. 
Q: Did you have the impression Œ and again, I Œ we want to get to the mai n part of 

this as the donation, but did you have the i mpression that when you Œ the access that 

you were given to t he consulate, to the Œ t o the office, where Œ the visa office, was 
that because of the Quakers™ name Œ  
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ or was it Œ 
do you 
Œ do you get the feeling that somebody, l ike 
Varian F
ry
™
s
 
group coul d have shown up and had the same kind of access, or the Mennonites, or 

the Unitarians? 

A: Well, I don™t know whether 
Varian Fry Œ 
I suspect Œ well, I don™t know. But 
Varian Fry
 was so close with Œ with 
Hiram Bingham
, that he didn™t have to g
o 
there, because 
Hiram Bingham
 could have gotten hi m anything he wanted. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: In m y case, it was Œ it was kind of an administrative thing, that  it was too ti me 

consuming for 
somebody like 
Œ li ke 
Chalmers
 to do, and I was t here Œ it was Œ he 
was more
 Œ it was kind of a clerical thing, you know, except there was a very high 

level clerical thing, you know, it was Œ cause it  was confidential. But you™ve seen 

m y 
Œ the letter that I su-suspect int roduced me to the consulate?

is why Œ why aren™t the wives incl uded? Sa y well, some of them, the men became 
famous and prosperous and others didn™t. And so, the y would have to wear clothes 
that the one s couldn™t afford the clothes that the wives who had the mone y could, so 

they didn™t invite the wives, so there woul d be no jealousy. But t his was m y wife and 

Œ and this i s the owner of the restaurant. That was in ™79. If you™re interested, I™ll

A: Now, you could argue that in Œ in 1897, that they wrot e the thi ng in Polish, so 
that must have meant something. But I di dn™t get far enough to figure out why it  was 

Polish, at that particular time. 

Q: Well, I have Œ one of m y colleagues is flue nt in Poli sh, and has done a 

tremendous amount of research into family history with Œ in Œ in

everything t hat happened in utter detail.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: I doubt that you™re interested in this. It™s a personal, family thi ng.

experiences, and what Œ what happened to hi m, and what happened to everyone. We 

would be interested Œ 

A2: Well, let me tell you the reason I think it™s pertinent, i s that 
Eva

Rudy

wife, 
was left in 
Berlin
, and theparents wentto see thedyingson.
 
Q: Oh. 

A2: And when

 was left Œ 
A: And the war started.

Eva
. And so she lived for 
how long with the aunt ? 

A: Well, she was Œ she got out in ™41, thi s was ™39, two years. 

Q: So, for years of Œ 

A2: Yes. So she didn™t see her mom and dad Œ

A: And she was only three years old. 
Q: Oka y. 

A2: Because they were caught in 
England
, they couldn™t go back, and she couldn™t 
go over, and so the aunt Œ 

Q: So yes, this is a very interesting Œ I™m very glad that we Œ we got t hat part of the 
story captured, yeah. 
A2: And so, you know, I just think it™s very pertinent because Œ and 
Eva
 did come 

out on the Œ isn™t i t Œ wasn™t it called the 
ki nder 
train? 
A: Well, she came on the 
seal
 train, through 
France
, to Œ to Œ to Œ  
A2: She came with h
er aunt.
 
Q: To 
Lisbon

here™s notthat much 
that™s actually been wri tten about i t, so Œ oka y. 

A2: Nobody translated those letters. 

Q: Oka y, so that™s the letters.  

A: I Œ I do n™t Œ I don™t know whet her what you just said is in there. Yeah, it says 

here, she remained in 
Berlin
 
on the 
Frankels
, flew to 
England
 until Septe

London
 looks like, 
cause it™s Œ 

A: Yeah, this is Œ 

A2: The day he died. 

Q: The day Œ oka y. 
A: This is the Œ what her father wrote to his brother in 
Brussels
.

A2: Again, Uncle 
Moe
(ph).  
Q: Uncle 
Moe
(ph). 

A: Un-Un- Un Œ Uncle

Eva
, 
that™s m y wife, that™s her birth certificate. 

Q: And nat uralization certificates, yeah. 
A: Yeah. And some Œ t his stuff is pretty self-explanatory. Oka y, t his Œ she got to Œ 
she Œ she got to Œ to 
Lisbon
, and she needed t h Œ well, where™s the first one? Did 
you ti Œ turn around? Now, she had to see a doctor, to certify that she had measles 

vaccination.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: Smallpox. Smallpox. And so t his is certificate, which I translated from the Œ
