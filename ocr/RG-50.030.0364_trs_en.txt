Question.  Le t me  start off by asking when your family first came  to Denmark?  
Answer. Well, on my  father's side, the family 
has been living in Denmark, in a number of 
cities of Denmark, al mos t  for 300 years, which in
 the terminology of Danish Jews, it's called the 
Viking Jews of Denmark.  Part of the fa mily ha
s assimilated, and part of them re mains Jewish, 
part of them became quite wealthy business 
people and part of them were rabbis.  

 So, my father was a rabbi. 

Q. The fi rst in the fa mily? 

A. No, there were rabbis all along the line al
most, going even six and seven generations 
back there were rabbis in the family.  So, my fath
er finished his studies in Germany at the time  
when there were no vacancies in the rabbinate 
in Denmark.  Therefore, he was not employed by 
the Jewish community until ve ry late.  But since German bec a me  the second language , he found 

some vacancies in the German rabbinate but obv
iously in 1933 when Hitler ca me  to power, we 
returned to Denmark.  We were then Danish
 citizens and Danish wa
s our mother tongue. 
 My father worked in different fields am
ong others in lecturing around the country and 
telling the Danes a little bit about wh
at the Nazi regime  actually meant. 
Q. Let me  just go back a minute and ask you a
bout the formation of the Copenhagen Jewish 
community and the establis
hment of the synagogue?

A. Well, the Jewish community of Copenhagen 
was officially established in 1684 when the 
first permission to hold religious services was 
given by the king of the time .  But it took some  
years to say the least before we were allo
wed to build a synagogue.  The present synagogue 
which is one of the oldest , at least in this ar
ea, was built in 1833, to me  a ma gnificent building, a 
place which has survived many attacks and also 
the Nazi period.  A place where King Christian 
the Tenth as the first sovereign attended a serv
ice in 1933 at the 100th anni
versary and since then 
his son Frederick the Ninth a
nd his granddaughter Queen Margar
etta our present Queen have 
visited the synagogue on quite a few occasions, 
the last of them was comme moration of the 
rescue operation fifty year
s after it took place, in 1993. 
 So, we have seen in that synagogue also the 
President of the St ate 
of Israel.  We  have 
seen David BenGurion and Golda Meir and ma ny othe
r leaders of Israel and 
of the Jewish people 
around the world.  We  have been laughing and cryi
ng together in that building which also in 
1985 was attacked by an Arab extr
emist with a bomb which dest
royed the whole entrance part 
which we could repair but happily
 enough they did not really dama
ge the important parts of the 
building. 

Q. In the 19th century was the Danish comm
unity, the Jewish community in Copenhagen a 
large one, a well to do one, was it very mi xed? 

A. The Danish Jewish community has never b
een big in numbers.  It's always been a 
comparatively small community, but very well 
organized and since 1814, fully recognized as 
equal to the offi cial religious community of De
nmark which is the Lutheran Church, together 
with catholics and Baptists and other Christian 
groups, the Jewish commun
ity has equal rights in 
all the 01:07:00  respects, all th
e rights of religious communities
 such as rights as conducting 
weddings with offi cial validity and we  also until th
is day keep the offi cial regist er of birth and 
death on behalf of the state. 

 We have since 1814 produced quite a good num
ber of people who have participated in 
public life in this country, have c
ontributed to science, to art, to 
industry, to trade and to political 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364

life in a degree far beyond the number we are until today we have 
perhaps eight or nine thousand 
Jews in Denmark and it has never been much more than that. 
Q. To go then to the ma tters of the o
ccupation by the Germans in 1940, how did that 
occupation affect the Jewish community? 

A. Well, to begin with, we shared the history 
of all other Danes.  Obviously we were mo re 
shocked, perhaps more afraid than the rest of
 the population because we didn't know what would 
be the outcome  but since the Danish governme nt wo
rked out some  kind of 
a coexistence with the 
occupation in power, one of the conditions of th
at coexistence was that
 no measures should be 
taken against the Jewish population. 

Q. Where did that stand derive from?  

A. It was obvious that if the Germans wanted
 some how a quiet area in Denmark, this was a 
precondition.  In Denmar k it was unthinkable that 
people should be persecuted because of their 
religious beliefs or even if they don't have any re
ligious beliefs  then of the fact that they were 
born of Jewish parents.  This could not ha
ppen in Denmark and no Danish governme nt could 
survive to accept and to be passive to such 
a decision.  The story goe
s that it was the king, 
Christian the Tenth who personally interviewed a
nd as a famous legend that the king when he 
went out to town as he did every morning on hi
s horse without any guards or any military or 
anything like that, he just was 
on his horse going through the city
 of Copenhagen and the story 
says that he was wearing the ye
llow st ar which the Germans used
 as the sign of 
disgrace to the 
Jews. We ll the truth is that he was never wearing 
that star because if he had taken it on his 
uniform he would have been the only one to wear 
it but he might have threatened to do so and by 
this it prevented any degradation was ever ma de to
 that end.  So, we lived 
as Danish citizens with 
the problems of an occupation power, of th
e problems of ha ving Germa ns enemies of 
democracy, enemies of a ll decency to have the 
real power in this c
ountry, but we were not 
suffering more than any ot
her Dane had to suffer.

Q. Did me mbers of the Jewish community 
participate in discussions concerning the 
understanding with the Germans about the Jews 
in 1940 or in preparation for the -- I know the 
occupation was a surprise, but there mu
st have been some  preparation? 
A. The Jewish community of 1940 was  a comm
unity I would say like the Jewish world 
almost in the 1930s.  Subdued, although until the 
occupation quite secure never the less low 
profile.  Don't let them hear that
 you are here.  Be quiet.  My fa
ther was by the official Je wish 
community several time s told off that  he was sp
eaking in strong terms against the Nazis.  Again 
it was an attempt that nobody should look at you.
  They mi ght get the wrong idea.   
 So, during the years of occupation, this te
ndency became even stronger.  We  stopped the 
ma gazine of the Jewish community that nobody s
hould say that we could vote the Germans to 
start anything with the Jewish community.  We  
were, of course, in contact with the official 
authorities, the government, to get infor mation but we
 just we re the receivers of that infor mation 
we were not creating the situation. 

 That was quite typical of the time s I would say. 

Q. There are those who refer to the occupation 
as a benign occupation or even as a time  of 
passive collaboration with the Germans. 

A. I would say that it was a problem especially
 if we compare to what happened in Norway 
where the Norwegians stood up against the German
s and fought them milita
rily.  At the same  
time I would say no collaboration and if we c
ontinue the comparison to
 Norway, the end to 
Norway was that they got a Quisling govern
me nt which means a government that was 
collaborating with Germans whereas in Denmark 
we kept the democratic governme nt which was 
certainly hostile to the Germans.  Things were 
hostile to the Germans we  have had borders with 
Germany all through history and we have 
fought ma ny wars with the Germans.  
 So, to begin with there was no chance of a
ny love affair.  There was no question that we  
tried to show our nationa l feelings, the birt
hdays of the king became 
demonstrations with 
hundreds of thousands of people in 
the streets.  We  were wearing small signs in our clothes even 
going with the Royal Airforce signs around.  There 
was no question where we were but we were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
5 
 
passive for a long time, and Danes did not likethe sound of a bomb exploding.  So, when the 
underground move me nt started to become  active,
 and bombing factories 
that were producing 
some thing called the Germans railway lines or sim
ilar then there were different opinions about 
that in the population.  It t
ook a very special action from the underground, which was a typical 
Danish action because it was carried out at 
12:00 noon and nobody got hurt and there was even 
involved the box for beer in that operation and it
 exploded in a big place which the Germans had 
just taken over.  That created suddenly an interest of a very positive nature, but that came  at a 

time when the Danish governme nt actually had resigned because the Germans de ma nded a 

stronger action againstthe Freedom Fighters, a type of
 action which again no Danish 
governme nt could accept and therefore they resigned.  There wa s never formed any other 

governme nt.  A Nazi governme nt like the Quisling governme nt in Norway could never take 

office in this country. 

Q. During the late 30s there was 
a great number of Jewish refug
ees from other countries that 
tried to enter Denmark and not all of them were accepted. 

A. That is to put it mildly.  Well, the whol
e western world did not 
respond to the tremendous 
need of giving to refugees at the time.  Agai
n, Denmark is a neighbor to
 Germany and therefore 
obviously there were people who tr
ied to get over the border and De
nmark did not give refuge to 
more people than other countries.  Our biggest e
ffort was, in fact, to allow young people to come  
to Denmark from Ger ma ny, young Jews, and to train them as far mers in Denmark and after a 

year or at the most two years th
ey could continue to then Pales
tine and work then in the kibbutz 
in Palestine in a very positive way.  That worked very well. 

 Also, the so called youth aliyah or Ju
gend Aliyah, had ma ny hundreds of youngsters 
comi ng to Denmark but most of them intran
sient and quite few were allowed to stay 

permanently. 

Q. Was this a source of tension or co
ntroversy within the Jewish community? 
A. The Jewish community tried to convince th
e governme nt to open up at  least a little bit 
more and from time to time we succeeded but in
 most cases we have to admit that the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
6 
 
government was afraid of creating a problem in 
Denmark.  They were afraid because all ot her 
countries were hesitant.  So, 
had one country suddenly opened up they could have had so ma ny 
that they couldn't handle the w
hole thing.  The conferences th
at were held at the time, 
international conferences, never gave
 a positive result.  So, this is 
a dark chapter in our history as 
it is for the whole western world. 

Q. Can you give me  the chronology of the rescue. 
 When did it become  clear that the Jewish 
community was imperiled? 

A. Well, on August 29, the Danish governme nt 
resigned and curfew was declared by the 
Germans and a number of strong me asureas, a prohi
bition to assemble in the streets and ma ny 
kinds of demonstrations and ma ny other specific
 measures were taken with the German tanks 

were going through the streets of Copenhagen.   

 At the time  that the governments resigned the Jewish community was fully aware that the 

protection they had until that
 point wa s gone.  Then rumors
 started and every day you had 
rumors in the morning and other rumors in th
e evening and I reme mber my father was very 

strong in his reaction to those rumors, being afraid 
that the various reactions
 would create panic.  
At the day of the 29th of August, leaders of th
e Danish society were 
arrested and among those 
leaders were also the then chief rabbi Dr. Freidi
ger, the president of the Jewish community and 

other Jews that held leading positions. 

Q. Why were these leaders arrest ed? 

A. Well, that wa s the way the Germans want
ed to prevent any po
ssible creation of a 
move me nt that was directed against them.  Th
ey thought by taking all these personalities those 
that could be thought of as leaders of such move me
nts, they were taken away from public life.  
Among them also a great number of officers of th
e Danish army and they were held in custody 
and didn't suffer very mu ch, but they were taken ou
t of society.  The Germans didn't realize that 
others could take the places of
 those that they held.  But, 
that was the purpose of that. 
Q. They were put in prison in Denmark? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
7 
 
A. Yes, in a camp here in Denmark but
 under comparatively good circumstances and 
nobody thought really that it should last for very 
long.  But, still we real
ize that the Jewish 
community was not treated differently from the re
st of the population because if they had not 
taken the leaders of the Jewish community we w
ould have said well, why didn't you take all the 
others and not our leaders, so wewould almost have been insulted. 
 But, that was the situation dur
ing the month of Se ptember.   
Q. What was your father's
 position at this point? 
A. Well, my father was a rabbi and had been 
a strong spokesma n against the Nazi regime.  
He was not officially employed as a rabbi.  He 
had some  teaching functions at the time and some 
lecturing functions but not act
ually serving in the synagogue. 
 Nevertheless he certainly was the one to 
whom people would look for advice in such a 
situation.  That was probably th
en the reason that when the news
 really came  to us about the 
plans of deporting the Jews of De
nmark to the camps in eastern Eu
rope, that there was sent two 
messengers.  Well, let me first tell you that one 
member of the German staff, a naval attache at 
the German embassy in Copenhagen, he decide
d to reveal the plans.  A certain Georg 

Duckwitz(?)and he had close relations to some  l
eaders of the Danish Social Democrat party and 
went to them and told them.  It was  on a Tuesday and the message was that the comi ng Friday 

night the Germans woul d go out and arrest the 
Jews of Denmark, put th
em on two boats that 
were already on the way to Copenhagen 
harbor and bring them to Auschwitz. 
 Now, the social de mocrats went to the pres
ident of the Jewish community who had been 
released by that time  and told him he would 
believe it and at the same  time they sent the 
secretary to our home, to my fath
er and gave him  the news and at that point my father convinced 

that it was true and again it was a problem how 
to react without panic.  The message was the 
Jews shall not stay at home  on Friday night. 

 Whether it will be possible later to return, 
we don't know.  The Germans here in Denmark 
are in fact against this decisi
on, but it is an order from Berlin
 and we can do nothing about it and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
8 
 
it has to be done and the Gestapo 
will be here to arrest the Jews. 
 So, for God's sake, don't stay at 
home.   
 Now the question was how do you spread th
e news.  Although you had three days to 
begin with the news came  at a time  when th
e curfew operated a fe
w mi nutes later and you 
couldn't go out into the streets.  You couldn't 
very well use the phone.  
So, the first chance to 
spread the news was on the We dnesday morning.  Now, that Wednesday was the eve of Rosh 

Hashanna, the Jewish New Year and there is 
a very early service in
 synagogues and orthodox 
synagogues where you say special prayers and where 
there are a little bit 
more people than on a 
usual normal week day.  

 So, my father stopped those services
 in the synagogue of Copenhagen. 

Q. In the mi ddle? 

A. In the mi ddle of the service and went to th
e Bima h and told the people what he had been 
told the night before. 

Q. Were you there? 

A. No, I was not there.  I was still supposed to be
 not part of it.  But 
he told them that the 
problem wa s to spread the news.  Everybody woul
d have to think of 
people especially the 
lonely(? ) people but every person he
 could think of should have th
e me ssage and better that the 
person should have the me ssage from five or
 eight different sources than no source. 
 So, there would be no services in the synagogue  on Rosh Hashanah.  This of course alone 

would ma ke it clear to everybody who would come  
to the services that there was some thing 
wrong.  And so we started finding out, I was runni
ng to people who lived not too far away and 
knock on their doors and telling 
them what was happening. 
 We were all sent around town.  We  also trie
d to phone some  people telling them that we 
didn't have any summer vacation that year so we 
would go to the country and people knew that if 
the rabbi goes into the country
 on Rosh Hashanah it is like Father Christma s leaving before 
December and that was some  of the wa
ys we used to get the me ssage around. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364

 Then really everybody had to find his ow
n solution.  There was absolutely nothing 
prepared whatsoever.  Looking back one wonders 
whether that was good or bad for the Jews.  If 
we had prepared things would it have been 
found out and stopped.  Now everything was an 
improvisation.  You did what you did.  Your friends
  reacted as they reacted.  Your next door 

neighbor, your shoema ker or your green grocer who whoever with whom you were in contact 

and the wonderful thing was that it didn't really
 ma tter who you chose at 
that point to be your 
helper.   

Q. Did you chose your helper or
 did the helper chose you?

 Tape

02:01:00 Q. Did you seek out help from othe
rs or did others seek to help you? 
A. Well, the others did not yet know about 
what was going to happen and my father had 
been a frequent guest at the various Da nish folk 
high schools since we were a family at that point 
six people, my eldest brother we
nt on his own and actually we nt very soon to Sweden but still 
we were six persons and we just couldn't go to
 the next door neighbor.  So, my father thought 
such a school would be a good place to go they would have room enough for a big number of 

people.  So, he phoned actually a place and the 
headma ster of the school imme diately understood 
what it was all about but he had 
to answer that there were so ma ny frogs in the area and thereby 
pointing to the green color of the soldiers which 
in this connection were German sol diers, so the 
Germans ha d taken his school and that would 
not be exactly the best place to hide. 
 So we took a chance.  Another former headma st
er of such a school had become  priest at a 

small village about 100 kilometers away from
 Copenhagen.  So, we went by train on the 
Wednesday and from the station of that little village my father phoned the priest who again 

immediately understood what it was about and the prie
st insisted that all of us stay in his house 
although my father's idea was that he could put 
one here and one there.  He knew people of his 
parish and he would know -- but no we should stay 
there and this was some  of the old fashioned 
parish priest's houses where there was room and 
even a big garden.  I remember the apple trees 
of that garden.  They were just giving the most 
wonderful apples out at th
at season.  I was then a 
boy of 14 and perhaps I didn't fully appreciate what
 was happening apart from the fact that we 

had to sneak away from our home 
wi th almost nothing in our hands. 
Q. Did people call your father and say what 
should we  do, how do we do it, or was it each 
man for hi mself?  Is that really the way it worked? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
11 
 
A. It was more or less each man according to hi s connections to the right to the left, some 
used to go in the summe r  period to some  place in 
the country so they woul
d try to contact that 
01:04:00  place.  Others actually just
 went into the next door neighbor. 
Q. So it wasn't  Jew going to Jew, a Jewish fa mily going to another Jewish family and saying 

we'r e in the same situation? 

A. No. 

Q. It was Jews turning to Gentiles? 

A. Exactly, all the way through.  I would 
say, all according to
 their situation. 
Q. And you had that confidence that the Gentile population would help you? 

A. I don't think that anybody real
ized that there was a danger. 
 I don't think that they had 
time to reflect too much, but to say where coul
d we go, who do we know.  Of course if you had 
closer relations you would choose such relations
 but ma ny pe ople came and asked for help from 
strangers. 

Q. How?  

A. We also left our own apartment.  We  told
 the host of the house, we paid some  rent in 
advance and said look after our place while we ar
e away.  We  told the milkma n not to put any 
milk there and you know, very soon there was no question.  Of course, little by little the rumor 

went around in town so that the non-Jews also
 learned about it and you 
could see places where 
teachers and schools would tell Jewish pupils to go 
home  to their parents.  The teachers would 
perhaps put their personal things 
to the disposal of such a family
 or at working places.  So, you 
perhaps had colleagues at work that would he
lp you.  Or you went to your doctor and doctors 
and nurses were very active in those days in hosp
itals in Copenhagen took in patients under other 
name s just to hide people.  All kinds of good ideas were taken into use 
and as I said it was 
improvised, all of it.  That pe
rhaps was the st rength of it. 
Q. Were there people who came to synagogue for the holiday not knowing --? 

A. That we never found out.  I never heard anybody
 saying to me  that they went there so I 
doubt it.  I think that already during the first 
day the news had come  around.  There were Jews 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
12 
 
still at the time I think for hist
ory it should be mentioned, who said
 it is not true.  This cannot 
happen here.  We  are under the protection of the 
king.  The poor king who at the time was very 
ill had fallen from his horse probabl y after so
me  provocation and had not ma ny chanc e s to 
protect anybody.  But I know of fa mi lies, parents 
and children who sat home on that fatal Fr iday 
night and more or less wa ited for the Ge
stapo because they didn't believe it. 
Q. What was the German reaction?  This obvious
ly is in retrospect when on Rosh Hashanah 
there was no Jewish community? 
They must have known. 

A. They were absolutely surprised.  No ques
tion about it.  They would not admit it and one 
of the leaders of the German occupation forces here sent a telegram to Berlin.  It doesn't  ma tter 

that we didn't  get so many of them, the main th
ing is that Denmark is J
udenrein.  That was their 
attempt to cover up the fa ilure which it obviously wa
s.  They had tried still to find out some  of 
the rout es that were established 
because that of course was our ne
xt step.  We  couldn't stay in 
these pl aces for very long.  Although we could 
trust the population, there still coul d be  the odd 

one out and there was the odd one out that would 
be informe r  to the Germans and therefore we 
had to think of what is now going to happen. 

 The dream we still had when we closed the 
door that we mi ght within a few weeks when 
things calm down, that we mi ght return.  That 
we realized we  dreamed.  So, already actually 
before the raids had started, certa
in routes to Sweden existed. 
Q. Were these prepared by resist ance pe ople? 

A. Yes, and they were already prepared 
before the whole situation around the Jewish 
population, but they were few and long in between 
but we had a their line to the free world via 
Sweden. 

 This would then be the natural thing and act
ually the same  Duckwitz(?) who gave us the 
information, had gone to Stockholm and had wi
th the Swedish governme nt discussed the 

situation.  When it became  clear on the Saturd
ay morning when it was published that the 
Germans ha d arrested as they said the Jewish 
population, or rather that they had removed the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
13 
 
Jews from Danish society, so now they could rel
ease the officers of the Danish army.  Then the 
Swedish governme nt issued a statement that they
 were prepared to take over the Jews of 
Denmark.  The Germans did not accept that propo
sal but thereby we could say that every Jew 
knew that could he reach Swede
n, he would be safe there. 
 That was of course of great importance. 

Q. How did that news come  to the Jewish
 community, which is no longer a community? 
A. It was no longer a community, although th
e community in a funny way continued to 

exist.  There were people of the community leader
ship that made some im
portant decisions in the 
financial field, how to dispose of the Jewish proper
ty here and other things
.  But we listened to 
radio.  We  didn't have to concentrate only on Dani
sh radio obviously.  It
 was not on the Danish 
radio, but Swedish radio and also the BBC pr
ograms.  So, th at was known to us, yes. 
02:13:00  Q. In terms of your own specific e
xperience, your fa ther knew a priest, some body 
who had been in school, was a priest.  You went to
 that small town.  Your father called.  He 
welcomed you.  Then what happened? 

A. Well this priest had a son who started law at
 the Copenhagen Universi
ty and as the father 
so the son -- the son was very active in the student
 organization to help Jews and to find out how 
to organize routes to Sweden.  So, there was alre
ady established a contact.  The priest said you 
stay here as long as you want, unt
il the end of the war, but after a number of days, we realized 
that it was too dangerous, not only for us but for 
the priest.  After all they were living normally 
two people in that house.  Suddenly there wereeight and already when he went down to the 

supermarket, which did not exist in those days, 
but his grocer suddenly products were sold in 
quite a different amount. 

 So, it could not work.  Then my elder brother 
went back to Copenhagen in order to try to 
raise the amount of money necessary to go to Swed
en because that was not free of charge and it 
was not the normal prices for tickets to Sw
eden.  It did cost quite a lot of money. 
Q. How did he raise the money? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
14 
 
A. Well, we tried to find people who we kne
w had some  money and 
who were willing to 
give us some loans at the time.  So, that was possible, although the sum which we needed was an 
enormous sum compared to the prices of those days. 

Q. How much was it and who gave you the price? 

A. It was different prices, but it could va
ry around at the time 1,500 to 2,000 Danish Kroner 
which wouldn't sound much of today, not terrible
 much.  I would say 2,000 Danish Kroner at the 
time was something like 300 American Dollars but if you mu ltiplied it by six you already had a 

bigger sum and that was a terrific amount.  And co
mpared to what my father's earnings were in 
those days, it was beyond reach of any kind. 

 But my brother managed to raise that money -- 

Q. FromGentilefriends? 

A. No, partly from Jewish friends. 

Q. Who were still in Copenhagen or had contacts to their offi ces in Copenhagen and were  

willing to do this, but there were bi g collectio
ns of money a mong Gentiles.  Again, I reme mber 
that the Dani sh society of medical
 doctors gave a big lump sum. 
Q. Towho m?  

02:17:00  A. To the resistance move ment. 
Q. Which then gave it --? 

A. Which then, so when they had the people -- there was nobody who did not go to Sweden 

because they didn't have the money.  So, althou
gh there was a price, the resist ance movement 
saw to it that nobody was kept back b
ecause he couldn't pay the price. 
Q. So, if your brother had not been able to
 raise the money, you coul
d have gone anyway? 
A. Yes.  That would have been the outcome  
yes.  But  it was a question of trying and of 
honor and of self respect th
at the money was raised. 
Q. How did you get in touch 
with the resi
stance people? 
A. Well, through that son of the priest there 
were other contacts at the time we decided to 
go.  The routes that were easiest, the sea is
 very narrow between Denmark and Sweden, in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364

Northen Sealand,  had become  very dangerous.  
The biggest mishap of the operation was in a 
small fisherma n town in northern Sealand called 
Gilleleia(? )_ where almost a hundred refugees 
were caught in the church of this place and ther
efore the advice was don't go out there.  It's true 
that it takes not much more than a half an hour
 and you are already in Swedish waters, whereas 
going south it would take you six to
 eight hours to go over the Balti
cs.  They said it wa s much 
safer to go south.  And that is how it worked and 
we got an address in a city down south and at 
that address we paid our money and we 
were advised to go to the Bishop's house. 
Q. How did you get to where you were to --? 

A. That's a good question.  We actually went by tr
ain and that wa s not one of the happiest or 
easiest  trips I made by train in my life because th
at very sa me  train going south of course also 
carried quite a good number of Germans and German soldiers. 

 So my mother and my youngest
 brother who at the time was only five years old were put 
in a special compart ment in fi
rst class.  Perhaps the boy woul
d start asking funny questions.  
Then we found out that the only woma n that wa
s in the same compart ment as my mother, took 
out a German newspaper.  So, when she left thetrain on the wa y, we were rather frightened that 

she would go and tell anything, but it worked out ve
ry well and we arrived sa
fely to this place. 
 Again, walking through the streets of that 
pl ace, you could here people say oh there are 
ma ny Jews i n town today.  So, the whole populati
on was involved and at the Bishop's place there 
was almost sixty refugees.  The whole town had 
to know about it because in the evening the cabs 
of the town came to take us to the 
various places where we should live.  

 So, it was a people's action and not only the 
resistance move ment.  At the same  ti me , as 
ma ny peopl e in the resistance moveme nt would te
ll you that the biggest recruitment for the 
resistance moveme nt came thanks to the rescue 
operation because then already so ma ny people 
had become  active who were never 
part of the resistance moveme nt 
before and they continued to 
work for the resist ance  al so afte
r the rescue operation had ended. 
Q. Did you meet with other Jewish fami lies w
ho were fleeing before you went to the place 

where you were going to get the 02:27:00  boat,
 before you went to the Bishop's house? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
16 
 
A. No.  After we left Copenhagen, no we di
d not.  My brother had, as I said, had some  
contact in Copenhagen, but apart from that no. 
 We were in a place where nobody else would 
ever dream of going and by coincidence had that 
contact there.  So, th
ere was no real contact 
after we had tried to spread the news as far as 
possible.  Then it was a break from one to another 
and I think that was necessary to ha ve  th
at br eak because had some body been caught and 
pressured to tell, we woul
d have had huge problems. 
Q. What day did you leave the first pl
ace that you we nt to, do you reme mber ? 
A. We went on the eve of Rosh Hashanah on 
a We dnesday, and we stayed there actually 
untill the following Friday.  The raid was on Frid
ay night at the end of Rosh Hashanah.  We  
came to this place and left there on the same da
y on the eve of Yom Kippur.  So, it was the hour 
of Kol Nidrei when we entered the fishing boat in 
order to go out there and we had a rather more 
dramatic trip but that has nothing to do with th
e general situation becaus
e our fisherman was not 
a very good navigator and he should have never u
ndertaken the responsibility that he did for 
nineteen people in this small boat.  He di
dn't know where he was going and when we actually 
saw land as was planned after a
bout eight hours, it turn
ed out to be Denmark and not Sweden 
and for a short mo me nt we thought that he was on
 the wrong side, but he 
was as scared as we 
were and we then found a route according to where the sun wa s on the horizon and mi raculously 
we reached Swedish coast before the fuel was gone. 

Q. OnYomKippur? 

A. That was Yom Kippur and we were seventeen 
hours on the Ba ltics so that was one of the 
Yom Kippur s I shall not forget. 

Q. Was there any observance? 

A. Well, we didn't have any food in any case so
 at least for seventeen hours we all fasted.  
But there was no service andthere was no chance of --.

A. In fact, when we arrived to the Bishop's  
yard, the Bishop was aware that it was a special 

day in the Jewish calendar comi ng up, but he was not
 aware of the laws of
 Yom Kippur so when 
he saw my father and recognized him, and they
 embraced, the Bishop put to him the question, is 
there anything special Jews are 
eating on Yom Kippur.  Of course, 
the first reaction wa s that the 
Bishop was ignorant, but the very 
important part of this is that
 the Bishop in this desperate 
situation where he was open to just one person in
 that town giving him away, with sixty Jews at 
his house, his ma in thought was that the Jews 
even under those circumstances should be given 
the opportunity to follow the laws 
of the Torah, the tradit
ional Jewish law.  That shows a little bit 
how the Danish church reacted.  That they di d 
not do what some other churches had done over 
history.  That  the rescue would be conditione d 
by giving up your religious ideas.  On the 
contrary they were willing to help us and they 
wa nted the Jews to be Jews and they were among 

the sixty people there Jews who would not know 
that it was Yo m Kippur th
at day, but the Bishop 
would tell them. 

 So, I have taken that as an example of how 
the church reacted that the Jews were helped 
as Jews and not as possible converts.  This is
 part of the picture that should be heard. 
 I reme mber at the point that some of th
e church 03:04:00  organizations in America 
issued public statements and asking for forgiven
ess for being passive during the Holocaust and I 

was asked did I expect a similar statement from th
e Danish church and I said the Danish church 
doesn't  have to ma ke such a statement.  They ma de a statement on the third of October 1943 

which was read  in all churches
 all over Denmark, a very strong protest.  Nobody could at the 
time know whether it was dangerous to read that 
statement in church, and 
they did it all over the 
country.  That was the strongest 
way of assuring the Jewish peopl
e of the support of the church 
of the Jewish population.

Q. Did you know that there were Jews that we
re captured?   Did you know
 about that or did 
you learn in Sweden? 
A. In Sweden we soon learned about it because 
those that were captured ha d relatives that 
succeeded to get into Sweden.  Among those we 
knew of course were de ported was the chief 
rabbi who had already been in German cust
ody since that day at the end of August. 
Q. He had never been released? 

A. He had never been released nor had his son by the way nor had the chairman of the board 

of the Synagogue, but little by little we  heard 
about the successes and the failures and that was 
soon established a contact through the Danish Red 
Cross to those that were deported.  So, we 
also heard about those who had died.  We  also
 found out possibilities 
to send passes that was 
soon after being well organized by the Danish Re
d Cross so that the biggest number of death 
actually was during the fi rst six months until abou
t March.  I have a regi ster here that  my 
predecessor Dr. Friediger(? )  who wa
s among the deportees, he kept as
 if he were still having the 
full register power of registration 
of deaths and bi rths etc., he ke pt a regist er according to the 
guidelines for the official register so 
I can see when actually the people di ed. 
Q. He kept this in Theresienstadt? 

A. In Theresienstadt.  You can see there that
 at the mo me nt when the food parcels started 
getting through people survived.  Incredibly, even
 in the concentration camps, the Jews of 
Denmark had special treatment.  I cannot understa
nd.  Nobody has tried to explain that to this 
day.  Theresienstadt was supposed to be one of 
the better places to come .  One of the better 
places to come meant that out of 140,000 captiv
es, 33,000 died there in Theresienstadt  and 
83,000 were deported to Auschwitz.  So, the number of
 survivors was sma ll, but the Da nish Jews 
were not sent, none of them, sent on to Auschw
itz from Theresienstadt.  And during the last 
month of the war in April 1945, the fa mous white 
busses that were originally organized by the 
Swedish Count Folke Be rnadotte arrived in Theresiens
tadt on the thirteenth of April and they left 
Theresienstadt and went through 
Denmark, taken to Sweden.  So, that was a great day for my 
father who in Sweden was working officially 
in the capacity as rabbi for Danish refugees. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
20 
 
Q. Your father then became the titular, 
head of the Jewish community in Sweden? 
A. The Danish embassy in Stockholm, in fact engaged him, I think it was the only time that 
the Danish embassy engaged a non-Lutheran priest, 
engaged my father as o
fficially the rabbi and 
he went and visited the Da nish refugees who were
 spread all over Sweden.  Some  of them got 
jobs in towns.  Others had to stay in some
 camps t hroughout the period.  So my father went 
around.  He organized services for them.  He esp
ecially tried to encourage them and give them 
hope.  He spoke to those who had relatives in 
Theresienstadt.  There 
were ma ny problems for 
rabbis to take care of and he worked very, very 
hard.  He was away almos t  all the time.03:10:00   
 So, he even had to go back before we were allowed to go back because the Danes in 

Sweden organized a mi litary unit 
in case there would be war over 
Denma r k then they could have 
gone over and participated.  Now, they went ove
r on the day the Germans capitulated.  They 
went over to do police work more or less and one 
of them got killed by a German bullet and my 

father went over for the funeral. 

 But we were back in Denmark three weeks after the liberation. 

Q. What was it like when you came back? 

A. That was a wonderful experience.  We were
 one of the first to come  back and people 

were so awfully nice. 

Q. Did you come  back in a group? 

A. It was very well organized in Sweden.  
There was a limit how ma ny people could go at 
the same  time on the boats back.  The official 
nice ferry boats and it 
only took an hour and a 
quarter.  It was a safe trip.  
So everybody had a note from the 
authorities what day would be 
theirs and we were among the first.  I think we
 were actually on the very fi rst day.  When we 
came home  t o our own street and me t the places, 
the people and I me t those that I used to play 
with the twenty months that we'd been away ha
d been ma king a difference to all of us.  But the 
way we were received we re extraordinary.  I ca
n say in the provincial towns where there were 
not so ma ny Jews the Jews that came back were 
received as heroes with
 flags all over town.  
Enthusiasm and my father used to say that th
is wa s even more important than the rescue 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
21 
 
operation because after all the resc
ue operation had as it's ultimate goal to help Jews leaving the 
countries.  Jewish history knows 
of ma ny cases where nations have helped Jews to leave their 
country, but we mi ght not have another example 
of a nation welcoming the Jews back to the 
country and that was done here I would say ev
en fr om people who mi ght have thought it would 
be nice if they had not come  back because perh
aps they had got an apartment or they were 
looking after a shop.  What I do know, it was almo
st a unanimous feeling of a war m welcome 
back to the Je wish community. 
 Then we had to try to settle everybody and re
gain according this situation and situations 
were not alike.  Some  people ha
d just closed the door and then 
nothing had been touched.  Their 
flats, their houses or whatever they had were
 exactly the same  position, 
a little bit of dust and 
that was it.  In some cases, ev
en the Copenhagen municipality ha
d paid their rent fer the period 
they had been away. 

 Others had said how can we leave a flat and 
not being able to pay so they had told the 

landlor ds they would give up the flat and suddenl y 
they were without a place to live.  It was not 
so easy at the time.  There was a shortage of 
apartments.  Some people had sold their business 
and came back to nothing.  So, it was different again from pe rson to person.  But there was 

established an office and special mi
nistry to assist people in that situation.  But in the end it was 
up to each individual to find out how 
to deal with it.  It took some  time.  A few peopl e had stayed 
in Sweden if they got good work 
there, why should they leave it. 

 So, we went through another quite difficult pe
riod.  But the day when we could reopen 
the synagogue was of course a very happy day. 

Q. When was that? 

A. That was a few months after we had return
ed.  We  had returned at the end of May, the 
beginning of June.  I can't  reme mber the exact 
date when we reopened but the synagogue was 

ready for the high holidays of Autumn of '
45.  The old chief rabbi had returned from 
Theresienstadt and was back for the service in the synagogue. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
22 
 
 In certain wa ys you could say we were back 
in business as usual, but it would never be 
the same  and it could never be the same .  Thecommunity had changed some  differences inside 
the community between the so called Viking Jews. 
 Those Jews who had been here for centuries 
and Jews that had come  in the beginning of th
e century from e a stern Europe.  Jews that had 
come from Germany in the thirties and you had 
a feeling that they had difficulties in getting 
together.  This was forgotten.  These differenc
es could no longer exist.  And there were ma ny 

other things where we had to re
alize a responsibility.  We  hear
d about the full truths of the 
Holocaust.  How could a Jewish community not react
.  We  tried to take  in, since we were better 
off than most other communities, al so materially
 better off, we tried to invite children fr om 
countries where they had suffered much more than
 we had suffered.  We  realized that we were 
part of the Jewish world.  With all our gratitude
 to Denmark and confirma
tion that we  were part 
of the Danish nation, this we never doubted, 
but perhaps we had in our attempt that nobody 
should have suspicion about our 
Danishness perhaps we had for
gotten our obligations to the 
outside Jewish world.  That had ch
anged.  That could never go back. 
Q. One hears about this occurrence of the guilt
 of the survivor, the individual Jew who lived 
while the others died.  Is th
ere any such thing as the guilt
 of the survivor  community? 
A. No, I don't think so.  I feel that people 
ask themselves why did I survive, and that 
question has no answer.  Who could 
claim that he was a better pers
on, that he was wiser, that any 
quality gave 03:19:00  justificationto the fact that he or she wa s 
saved and the others were not.  
That to ma ny people created an obligation, an ob
ligation to be more involved.  That we were 
saved gave an obligation to try to save others
 who would be endangered and there was enough to 
do. 

 But I don't think we in Denmark had any fee
ling of guilt.  Our disaster would not have 
helped others so since we  did not survive so that 
others paid the price, I don't think we had this 
feeling of guilt. 

Q. It's  an irrational feeling, it's  
a feeling that come s out of trauma? 
A. Sure, and we asked the question, 
but as I said nobody has an answer. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
23 
 
Q. Was it a trauma tized community, would you say? 
A. The trauma  came when we saw the realitie
s of what we actually escaped.  But again, I 
have a feeling that you see there a generation ga
p.  A generation that 
was already adults and 
responsible people in their thir
ties and forties and then a gene
ration that grew up and became  
adults after the creation of
 the state of Israel.  You see there 
is a completely new Jewish world.  
 I reme mber when I started work for a jewelr
y(??) Jewry(?) here in Denmark and I joined 
the internat ional Jewish forces on 
behalf of Soviet Jews, the genera
tion that were just a few years 
older than I am were not too ha
ppy about this to begin with.  Th
ey felt, again be quiet, don't let 
others pay attention to the fact that we ar
e here.  We can live w
ithout that attention. 
 Then the younger generation said we  are res
ponsible to a much higher degree and I mi ght 
generalize a little bit but I would sa
y it was quite typical and I think 
that was also the result of the 
rescue.  Others didn't do it for us, we had to do 
it for us.  We  are in 
this situation together. 
03:23:00  Q. What were one or two extraordinar
y stories about the resc
ue that you've learned 
about?  

A. Well, I would say that you are now in a situ
ation where historians move in and I have no 
specific animosity against hist orians but I feel hi st
orians like in other fiel
ds, I could take my own 
field of theology, you have here a 
very clear picture of what happe
ned.  All right, 
you still have 
questions here and there, but generally speaki
ng it is very open.  We  have had so ma ny 
thousands of witnesses to expre
ss what they actually 
experienced, so what is an historian going 
to do about that.  Since everybody for a number of y
ears has been praising the rescue operation if 
you want to ma ke a new thesis, a new doctorate 
of what happened, you have to go against that 
what is generally accepted.  So, suddenly you find 
historians who try to say this is nothing and 
actually the Germans closed their eyes and it was 
not dangerous to help them.  I can get quite 
furious at these stories.  I feel 
first of all they don't  know wha t  
they'r e talking about.  There were 
people who died in that opera
tion and nobody at the time  coul
d know how dangerous it was. 
 It is true that if the Germans had put th
eir navy fully into the wa ters between Denmark 
and Sweden, they could have stopped the resc
ue operation, but the Germans had some other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
24 
 
things to do with their navy so 
it was limited how much they could 
prevent it.  And they did in 
fact at a number of points stop the transports fr
om Denmark to Sweden.  So, it was not a really 
closed eye, but 03:26:00  one of 
the stories I learned about much la
ter.  In fact with connection 
with our celebrations in '93 was a story of 
a woman, a blind woma n wh
o had hired a cab and 
although she was blind on the first part of the tour
 she directed the driver
, right here, left  here, 
straight, until they reached a certain corner wher
e she asked the driver to stop and she pointed to 
a house across the street and she as
ked the driver to describe what
 he saw there.  He described 
the place, whether it needed some  pa inting, what
 it looked like and she 
sat and listened, said 
nothing, then after a few mi nutes 
of silence she said to the dr
iver well now you can go on to the 
address I told you. 

 So, the driver got curious and wanted to know
 why should he tell a
bout this house.  Why 
should he stop there.  So, the woma n tells him that during the second world war when we 

reached October of '43 s he lived in that hous
e with her husband and her children and the idea 
was that every day the resistance 
mo veme nt brought a numbe r of refugees that were more or less 
parked in the house until the evening when they
 tried to find chances of transport.  Some  
evenings they couldn't find any transport so the 
refugees stayed over the 
night until the following 
evening and this went on for a number of days
 and she was a little bit afraid.  Perhaps the 
children would talk at school, but it all went ve
ry well until a night when they had a number of 
refugees in the house, a big carav
an of Ger man military cars stopped outside the house and they 
were sure that the last  mome
nt had come .  She herself, th
is woma n got terribly excited.  
Everybody was sitting in complete silence.  Her ex
citeme nt was so strong that the blood veins in 
her eyes bursted and she was blinded.  Th
at was the situation when she got blind. 
 After some  mi nutes of her and everybody else
 there as if it wa s 
hours, all the German 
cars started.  Not one soldier had left the 
cars, nobody had knocked on the door and why they 
had stopped there nobody can tell yo
u.  The only lasting effect of
 it was that this woma n was 
blinded. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0364  
25 
 
 So, the taxi driver asked the woma n I can unde
rstand that you wanted 
to save people, but 
it was it not a terribly high pri
ce to pay for your huma nitarian ideas?   So the woma n s a id if you 
ask me  whet her I am sorry that I was blinded I ca
n tell you it has been terrible.  Could I wish for 
anything, I wish for my eyesight back.  But if 
you ask me  if you could live your life again, would 
you have done the same  thing, I could tell you yes, I 
would do the same  thing.  You see, this fact 
is so strong that that tells about
 the approach, about the ideas of our rescuers
 that they knew there 
was a risk and even with that risk they woul
d do it.  Later for most of our good friends, it came 
out that they survived as well and that is very eas
y to see after this.  But at  the time it was a risk 
and some  of them paid a high price and even
 then they would say they would do it again. 
 This is to me a much stronger proof against t
hose so called historians who try to belittle 
what happened in those days.  Again, we have to 
understand that the rescue
 did not just happen.  
It was a result of a long relationship between the 
Jewish and Christian populations.  If there had 
not been any relationship I doubt whether it woul
d have happened.  But there was a relationship 
and that relationship proved itsel f to be as strong as it was when
 it was necessary to prove it.  
 I believe that this pe rhaps is also a less
on of the whole rescue operation that this open 
door policy of a community  towards the ma jori
ty community in the country and that is a 

necessary step if we want good relationship it mean
s we mus t  be open.  Not that we shall forget 
who we are.  Not that we shall forget  our 
roots, but at the same time the positive to the 
community among who we are living. 

Q. Wouldn't you say that the German Jewish community was plausible?

Q. Let me  ask you about the German Jewish 
community which ma de great openings to the 
community at large in co mparison to the Dani
sh Jewish community in Denmark that was 
received with a welcome that sust aine d itself when the Jewish community was threatened but in 
Germany that was not the case.  Ho
w would you account for the difference. 
A. There were ma ny contacts between German 
Jews and Germa n Christians.  They were 
more on the professional level.  The German Chri
stians would have a Jewish doctor or a Jewish 
lawyer but it rema ined more or
 less a mystery what is Juda ism.
  So beyond that general human 
relationshi p it is very important  for a Jewish co
mmunity not to hide its specific customs because 
if you will fight the pr ejudice that exist among various nations and various religions you can only 

do so by being open by explain to people what do
es it mean, why a m I doing this why am I doing 
that.  I reme mber  a funny example perhaps, 
I was in my younger days responsible for the 
summer holiday camp of Jewish children.  The nei
ghbors of our place there 
went out to have a 
quiet good 04:02:00  time in the summer they were 
a little bit disturbed th
at here was a group of 
youngsters that ma de noise in various 
ways at various time s of the day. 
 So, I decided to invite all th
e neighbors.  I ma de an open da
y at this place where all the 
neighbors came in and I told them about our prog
ram and when they heard this noise it meant 
that there wa s this activity going 
on and that noise was another ac
tivity, etc.  Suddenly we were 
wonderful friends and the people th
ought it was exciting that they have got this camp a s  their 
next door neighbor.  This is where 
I say if we as Jews invite pe
ople into the synagogue, not with 
any mi ssionary ideas at all but they should know wh
at are we doing there, and what does it mean 
to us and if we at the same  ti me  pay interest 
in what are they doing in their chur ches or their 

mosques and what does it mean to them, that is 
the way I try to point out is important in a 
relationshi p to fi nd these ideas that even when th
ey think they are nice people but they are crazy, 
there is very soon some  mystery 
comi ng around.  Traditions that are 
not so mystical.  If we only 
get an opportunity to explain what 
a symbol means, then the symbol 
is beautiful.  If they just see 
the symbol and don't know what it is they become  afraid.

Q. Was the community then fr om the turn of
 the century on the Jewi
sh community actively 
making itself evident too? 
A. Little by little.  I must say that perhaps 
my father's biggest cont
ribution to the Jewish 
community was that he was able of explaining thes
e things, but there had been others before him, 

and I would like to add that this
 is happening today also in Germ
any.  You have ma ny countries 
in Europe where you find councils of Christians a
nd Jews and there  perhaps I could add that one 
of the countries where you don't have a council of
 Christians and Jews is Denmark.  Be cause the 
me re fact that you need a council
 is already showing a problem. 
 I have been serving together with three bi
shops of the Lutheran Church in Copenhagen 
and I have to every one of them put the questi
on should we establish a co
uncil of Christians and 
Jews and after having discussed it with them, 
we came to the same  results what should that 
council do?  If we should have problems and we 
mi ght have problems so either you phone me  or 
I phone me  and we discuss the problem and we solve 
it if we need.  We  don't have to for malize 
it.  But you find such councils in Germany and Engl
and and Sweden and in other countries.  This 
is a very important step forwar
d and if we would have had that
 100 years ago, I think that it 
would have been much more difficult for the Nazis to work because you cannot if you have 

sufficient infor mation you can not go around telling st
ories of cruelty and what they tried to put 
into their propaganda if people 
know better and therefore it was a 
big job and an important job 
between all groups in this society to be open and 
to give that amount of c onfidence from one to 
another that is necessary.  War, persecutions, ar
e very often ba sed on fear
 and it's very often a 
groundless fear.  That is 
where we could do better. 
Q. Danish tolera nce that  was built up before th
e war towards the Jews, did you ever think it 
was unique? 

A. I didn't think of it like that
 in those days, and I want to
 say when you use the expression 
"Danish tolerance", the Danes 
are not born more tolerant than anybody else.  We  fe el it 
nowadays where we have got a problem with th
e Muslims, but you see the Jews are that ma ny 
steps ahead of the Muslims because the Danes know
 they have nothing to 
fear from the Jews.

They haven't got the same  feeli
ngs of security when you speak about Muslims.  They don't know 
anything about the Muslims.  Th
ey mi ght know something about th
e old testament even if they 
don't understand it, they know absolutely nothing a
bout the Koran and therefore there is a fear 
and where there is a fear you see intolerance 
growing and that is the problem of toda y. 
04:08:00   So, this proves the 
point that Danish tolerance is
 not some thing which you inherit 
from somewhere(?); Danes are normal people. 
Q. And yet during the second world war they
 behaved differently from any other group? 
A. Yes, but that is based partly in any case 
on the more open relationship.  Partly of course 
also because we had the common enemy.  Partly 
because we had the opportunity, but you're right 
when it comes to all that it amount
ed to a situation where, I woul
d say they were brave people.
