Interview with Liane Reif-Lehrer 
May 28, 1999 
Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, 
this is an interview with
 Liane Reif-Lehrer, conducted
 by Sandy Tolen, on May 28
th
, 
1999, in Lexington, Mass-Massachusetts. This 
is a follow up interview to a United States 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum vido-videotaped 
interview, conducted 
with L-Liane Reif-
Lehrer, on -- in 1989. 
Answer: It was early 1990. 

Q: Or early 1990. We™ll provide that date 
shortly, matter of fact -- the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
 gratefully acknowledges 
Jeff and Toby Herr for making 
this interview possible. This is tape number 
one, side A. Okay , so, now we start and we 
know who we™re sittin g with. So
, I guess there™s -- there™s so
me things probably, that 
have occurred to you since then
, that you might want to -- to explore, and I want to invite 
you to take the opportunity, 
during the context of what we
™re talking about, or the 
chronology, or if there™s things that just co
me up along the way th at you want to discuss, 
we can do that. 
A: Mm-hm. Okay. 
Q: And I first of all w ant to thank you for ta
king the time to sit and talk. And I know that 
-- that some of these memories are painfu
l, and -- and I respec
t your journey, and 
appreciate you sitting a
nd talking with me.

A: Thank you. 
Q: I guess I wanted to first as
k if you could maybe take us 
back and -- and to  the extent 
that you can return us to a 
child™s memory, and th
rough a child™s eyes, and in a child™s 
heart, remember the feelings that you 
had when you were le
aving Limoge an-and 
traveling through Spain. As I 
recall from the interv
iew that you did, that you were on a 
train and, rememb er at all what you were 
thinking during that 
time, what was going 
through your mind? I know that
 you were very young, so a lo
t of it was probably a blur 
now, but rememb er what was going on in 
your mind and your heart? What were you 
thinking about, wh at were you co ncerned about? 
A: I don™t really remember an
 awful lot. I -- I think I ofte
n felt -- I guess you could call it 
a sense of confusion, by things that were goi
ng on, for example, as
 I mentioned in the -- 
in the video interview 10 years ago, it was st
range things that happened. Fo r example, I 
was told never to lie, and then 
all of a sudden, I™m told to lie
 to the German soldiers, and 
-- and make believe that I can™t understand Ge
rman, or speak German
, when that was my 
obvious, fluent, first language. I -- I thi
nk I rememb er being, I don™t know whether 
disturbed is exactly the right word, but for ex
ample, the -- the crowded, awful conditions 
on that train. I mean, I remember that quite clearly, so many 
people crowded into a such a 
-- a little sp ace, and -- and crowded in, not th
e way we had been cr
owded in our living 
quarter, even when we were liv
ing, you know, 30 females in th
is -- in this little room, but 
crowded in a chaotic way. All these people, w
ith these -- all these pa
ckages and I seem to 
remember it was night time and I guess it -- 
I guess maybe it was a little scary at times.

And so I -- I remember a feeling of apprehensi
on often, but other than  that, I don™t -- you 
know, I remember -- my 
memories of that time are very
 mu ch -- I was trying to  explain 
this to people, they™re like still photographs th
at somebody just snapped, along the path of 

my  life. As opposed to my  brother, who™s mu
ch older, and who really sort of remembers 
them like a videotape. I mean, 
you know, this happened , and th
en  this happened, and then  
this happened. And for me, it™s a bunch of stills that -- 
Q: Go ah ead. 
A: -- that capture either very significant times
 -- significant to me, as a little kid, because 
there was some traumatic thing happening, or 
some trivial thing ha
ppening that captured 
my imagination. So I don™t reme
mber -- as a matter of fact, 
throughout my life, I™ve tried 
to retrace that journey and just -- there -- ther
e were only two places left to go last year, 
and so, actually in October, my  husband an d I 
went on a bicycle trip
 to -- to Portugal, 
because that was the next to the last place, of
 the places that I had been, that I had not 
revisited. And as -- as I said 
10 years ago in the interview, 
I -- I always think when I do 
one of these things, that maybe I™ll come acro
ss something that will so
rt of stir something 
in  my  b r ain, en ou gh  to  mak e  me r e memb er
 what happened here. And so, as we were 
walking thro ugh the streets of Lisbon, I mean
, we built about -- I think it was about four 
days into  staying in Lisbon, before the bicy
cle trip began, just because I wanted to 
explore, and see if I could remember anything, 
but absolutely nothing 
struck a bell, that I 
could tell, in Lisbon. And we -- I -- we were
 apparently there for about two weeks. So 
there™s one -- there™s one more place. We -- 
We did stop very briefly in two cities in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
5 
 
 
 
Spain, and I -- I™d still like to 
go to those places, one of them is Madrid. But I -- I think 
I™ve kind of run through the gamu t of things 
that are going to jog my -- my brain, and -- 
and now, especially because I™m
 getting older and -- and at le
ast short term memory is -- 
is getting wo rse, I think -- well, you know, I 
mean, the -- the ta -- unless -- unless I get 
Alzheimer™s and -- and, you know, and sudden
ly things pop out of what I call my little 
black box, I think whatever I™v
e remembered , is what I™m goi
ng to remember, and -- and 
nothing else.  

Q: When you talk about snap
shots, I mean, are -- are there particular -- I guess it comes 
to mind this sort of images frozen in time, in
 a sense, in -- in your memory. Are there 
particularly memo rable images like that, from th at journey that -- that -- that you recall? I 

mean, that -- that perhaps you -- you didn™t ta
lk about it er -- in th
e earlier interview? 
A: You mean from the journey 
through Spain in
to Portugal? 
Q: Mm. 
A: Only  that scene of all that chaos on th
e train. Other than that, I don™t remember 
anything. I mean, I have -- I have an image wh
ich is not mine, that my  brother has told 
many times, of -- of switching trains at th
e -- at the Spanish - Portuguese border, and 
going from this incredibly messy
, chaotic situation, and in -- 
and having been  really quite 
hungry fo r the last year and a half, coming into 
this very nice train, with this -- my bro -- 
when my brother tells the story, his eyes ju
st light up about the,
 you know, the sudden 
smell of fresh rolls and -- but -- but that™s 
not my own memory, I mean, I™ve just heard 
him tell that so often that I almost feel as th
ough I -- I remember it, 
but I -- I don™t, really.

I do remember, actually, when we 
got on the ship in -- in Li
sbon, to come 
to the United 
States. I remember tables set 
for meals in -- in the dining
 room, and -- and I think -- I 
think I rememb er having dinner the first night, 
or some meal the first night, and then th e 
rest of the time, we were horrendously seasic
k and we™d -- I don™t think we essentially ate 
anything else for the rest of the journey, as 
far as I can remember. I just -- I remember -- I 
remember feeling awful, a
nd barfing and -- but that™s al
l I remember, until -- until we 
actually got to the U.S., and th
en I remember that --  that
 awful time of having this 
medical check, which I -- which I me
ntioned in the -- in the video. 
Q: Just -- Yeah, everybody
 sitting there with thermo
meters in their mouth. 
A: Right, right, right. Thermometers that I ha
d never seen the likes of before, and feeling 
-- I remember feeling a sort of halfway be
tween being frightened
 and being puzzled 
about, you know, why were th
ey doing this and were they going to  make us go back? 
Q: D-Do  you -- Do  you think that you had a 
sense at that time, or do you remember an 
emotion at that time, abou
t why you were doing th is, wh
y you were going? Do you -- 
Was it -- W as it conscious for a little girl that 
-- you were what, four and a half at the 
time? 
A: Well, I was seven by th e time we got here. 
Q: Oh, oh, course. Okay. 

A: I don™t think I really understood wh at was 
happening, but I knew there was a reason to 
be afraid. I sort of knew that there were 
people who were chasi
ng us and wanted to do 
bad things, and I knew that -- I sort of had a se
nse that if we could co me here, that things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
7 
 
 
 
were going to be better or okay 
or -- or something. That this was sort of a goal, of getting 
away from this bad scene. And so, that 
day wh en we were having these medical 
checkups, I don™t know how I knew this, I mean
, maybe my  mo ther had said some things, 
or maybe I heard other passengers, but I n 
-- I think I was aware that if there was 
something wrong with you, th
at you could be sent back. But other than that, I don™t 
remember anything else.  
Q: So when you -- well then, you
™ve -- you™ve told this a little 
bit, so I won™t ask you to 
dwell on it, but what -- what are some of your most vivid memories, early memories, 
once you got off the boat and -- and you stayed
 with the Klinghoffers, right, your -- your 
-- your cousins? What are the things that 
-- that stick out mo st from those early days, 
whether it™s staying with them, or other kinds 
of adjustments that you had to make during 
that -- during th e time which -- wh ich would ha
ve been what, in ™4
1 now we™re talking 
about. 
A: We got here on Novemb er 10
th
, 1941. I guess in a lot of ways, I mean, I had learned 
by th en to be very malleable
. I mean, you know, I got thro
wn -- I mean, I remem -- for 
example, I™m a really fantastic sleeper. I ca 
-- I mean when I -- 99 percent of the time, 
when I go to sleep, I™m asleep
 before my head hits the p
illow, practically. And, until the 
children were born, th ere would be nothing, ot
her than the telephone, that could wake me 
up, and I™m still a really fant
astically good sleeper, and so
metimes people ask about that, 
and I say, well, I think that had to do, first 
of all because when I was little, an d I had a -- a 
governess in Vienna, apparently she let me cr
y myself to sleep, so
 I re -- I must have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
8 
 
 
 
learned that there was no recourse
 when  you had to go to sleep
, than to sleep. But I think 
the other reason is that, over those next few 
years, I mean, I slept in so many bizarre 
situations, I mean like, sleeping one night on th
is scale in the railroad station. And I just 
kind of learned that, you know, when it™s ti
me  to sleep, you ju st, regardless of what 
happens, you sleep. And I remember, I ha
d a one hour commu te to go to  Barnard 
College, cause we lived in -- in Brooklyn, a nd I -- I think I actually sometimes could fall 
asleep standing up in the subw
ay, holding on to the strap. An
d now, I mean, just the last 
few days, I™ve actually been posing -- our son is
 an artist and I™ve be
en posing for him, 
and I -- I find that that™s really hard work. 
Bu t I find that sometime s I™m standing th ere, 
and I actually have dozed off 
standing up, while I™m, you know, 
clamped into  a particular 
position.  
Q: Mom, it™s time to cha -- Mom. 

A: Right. So, I think I just learned to be ve
ry  malleable, and so wh
en I got to graduate 
school and I met the guy who™s 
now my  husband, and I went on some camp ing trips for 
the first time, I -- I mean, I had never experienced that and so we -- a group of us went 

and we just had these zero pound
 sleeping bags and rolled them out on a rock and so -- all 
right, so the group said, ﬁAll right, we™re goi
ng -- going to sleep now.ﬂ So I just laid 
down on this rock and fe
ll asleep. And my husband, w
ho was supposed to be the 
experienced camper, you know, every three mi
nutes -- he was lying next to me and 
waking me up and, ﬁSh, what™s that?ﬂ You 
know, ﬁWhat™s that noise?ﬂ Or -- Or, ﬁBoy 
this rock is hard,ﬂ or something like -- and it -- 
I mean, th ose things just
 really -- when we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
9 
 
 
 
-- during the Kennedy elections, we didn™t have
 a television, and I was at a friend™s house 
and I think this is an apocry phal story, but 
he claims that I fell asleep while we were 
watching television and that he accidentally st
epped on me and I didn™
t wake up. So -- So 
I think I just have this -- I mean, I™m not 
-- there are a lot of wa
ys in which I™m not 
flexible, but in terms of physical surround, 
I think because of what happened, I™m -- I™m 
very flexible. I mean, my husba
nd need s a certain kind of a be
d before he can fall asleep, 
you know, and a certain surrou
nd. And other people I™ve been
 with , have to kind of do 
certain things, and get themselv
es ready for sleeping and so on
. And I just -- that™s just 
not requirement for me, you know, whatev er 
is there, I don™t -- I don™t have -- I™m a 
picky eater in one way, but I don™t mind no
t eating and so -- so I™m -- I™ve -- I think 
because of those years, I™m 
just very malleable in term
s of, you know, those physical 
things and -- and -- and needs. I think I™
ve strayed now, from what you asked me. 
Q: No, but I -- Actually that™s 
-- it™s interesting, the whole 
notion of malleability in some 
parts of your life, but not others. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: I mean, and -- and -- and you -- you were 
saying, if I™m understanding you right, that 
that™s a part of what yo -- how
 you learned to adapt to circ
umstances when  you were very 
young, right? 

A: Yes, yes. So -- So anyway
, okay, now I™ve regained the th
read of what you asked, so 
okay, so I got to my  aunt™s house and my  Aunt
 Lena ha-h ad one of 
her kids move out of 
this -- what I remember being a really tiny 
little room, and my mother and my brother and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
10 
 
 
 
I got to live in there for abou
t three months. And so , you know that was all right, I mean, 
I™d done that kind of thing be
fore and as I™m -- as I said 
on th e video interview, I mean, 
people thought that we would ju st kind of gobble up anything
 that was offered to us to 
eat, and I -- I didn™t. I mean, a lot of things th
at people presented to me were awful, and I 
mean, one of the things that -- th
at I came to realize in that 
time is that adults do really 
bizarre things to children, you 
know. I mean -- And I™m -- I™m aware of this still now, as 
an adult, and I think this ve
ry much colored the way we ra
ised our children. But, for 
example, I -- they wo uld put me on a swing, th
ey would take me to the park an d put me 
on a swing, and I would say, ﬁPlease don™t do th
at.ﬂ But they would insist and they would 
put me on the swing and start swinging me, 
and I would barf. And 
I knew I was going to 
barf, cause I knew that I couldn™t -- I -- I was 
just so subject to mo
tion of any kind. But 
they would just insist. And th
en my -- my Aunt Lena™s brother owned what was called a 
luncheonette in New Yo rk, and 
so when  I visited him, which 
was not terribly often, but -- 
but mo re so in the early days, he thought 
he was doing me this bi
g favor, and he would 
present me with, you know, a bi
g sundae, with lots of whippe
d cream. Well, here™s a little 
kid, age seven, who has had almost nothing 
to eat for a year and 
a half, and he would 
insist that I eat this. Well, 
you know, putting whipped cream, 
which is like a lot of fat, 
into a little kid™s system, who hasn™t eaten a
nything for a year and a half, just doesn™t 
work out very well. And adults don™t listen. 
I mean, you try to say, ﬁExcuse me, but I -- I 
really would not like to eat this.ﬂ Tota
l, you know, ignoring o-of that. I™ve -- 
Q: And what were the consequences of that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
11 
 
 
 
A: I used to feel really sick
 after a sundae, or even in -- 
even later, my -- 
after -- I mean, 
many years later, my  cousin  Do rothy, who was 
the youngest daughter
 of my  Aunt Lena, 
married a doctor and they had kids, and I wo
uld sometimes baby-sit for them, or I would 
just go and visit, and I would 
often eat dinner there. And I™v
e never been mu ch  of a meat 
eater, and I™m getting worse as the years go by, 
but first of all, ma 
- -  wh en  my  mo th er 
made meat, she salted it and then she always
 cooked it extremely well done, so it was 
always very  brown looking. And I would eat th
at, and I guess I sort of enjoyed some of 
those dishes at the time. But at my cousin™s 
house, she would make 
this rare steak, you 
know, like a big, thick Filet 
Mignon kind of thing, and it 
looked as though it was still 
alive. And I would say, ﬁI™d rather not eat th
at.ﬂ And -- I mean, they just wouldn™t take no 
for an answer, and my cousin, th-the doctor
 -- the husband, would say, ﬁYou are going to  
eat that,ﬂ you know, and I would sit there, at
 her house, having dinn
er, with this tears 
streaming down my eyes, trying to force th
is bloody mess down my throat. I mean, I 
don™t know -- you know, they were
 trying to be nice, but I think -- again, I just think 
people don™t listen to what kids have to sa
y, and so -- so there were some traumas like 
that, that -- that happened. Bu
t anyway, at -- at my Aunt Lena™s, you know, life was okay. 
I -- She was not very insistent on that I eat th ings  that I didn™t like, and so we just kind of 
stayed there and I ate. I don™t -- I have no re
co llection of how I kept my self busy during 
the day, during those three months, cause I 
wasn™t in school or anything. I rememb er 

being sort of -- very watchful of my  cous
in Dorothy. She was -- 
That was the youngest 
daughter, you know, who later ma rried this doc
tor. Sh e was very pretty and very -- She 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
12 
 
 
 
wore nice clothes and I reme mb er she had th is
 really attractive -- as a matter of fact, I 
have a -- a picture of her, I think, in this ha
t with beaver trim, you know, big, broad -- and 
I kind of watched her a lot, and I think I r
eally liked her. She was sort of my favorite 
cousin, in th e beginning. And th en -- So we 
-- we kind of stayed there and my mother 
went around, trying to figure ou
t what to do, and then  we fi
nally found this apartment in 
Brooklyn and I think -- I think the rent was li
ke 46 dollars a month at the beginning. So  
we moved to Brooklyn, and that was kind of 
far away from where my aunt lived, in the 

lower east side of Manhattan, but it was only 
two blocks away from another relative, so 
that cousin, who lived in Brook
lyn, whose name is Hilda To
wderer, and who just had her 
80
th
 birthday, she -- I just got a letter from her 
about a week ago, I th
 -- I™m pretty sure 
now that it was to her parent™s home, and she,
 of course was living there, she was a kid, 
that we went the day my  father died. And 
that™s where my mother and father were 
supposed  to meet again. So , I have occasiona
l contact with her and in recent years, we™ve 
actually corresponded, you know
, several times a year. S o  
anyway, so -- so we moved 
and she already had a little boy, 
who unfo rtunately died of, 
I think, lymphoma, about, I 

don™t know, 10 or 15 years ago, and th en sh
e had a set of twins. She had another child 
many years later, but I -- I never have even se
en that other child. Bu
t anyway, so we had 
this other sort of relative, a
nd -- and we set up in this apar
tment, on the fourth  floor of 
1092 President Street in Brook
lyn, wh -which I think stands out in my  mind, because I 
don™t -- I don™t remember anything green on th
at block. There was an empty lot, there 
might have been a couple of trees, but if th
ey were, they were sm
all and very few -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
13 
 
 
 
mean, it was really a kind of stark thing, and 
there was an armory acr
oss the stre et, and so 
the armory was like a solid brick wall that went 
for mo st of the block. We used  to use that 
to play ball against. And then
 at the end of the block, there was a little synagogue. But it 
was a very stark block and it was -- it was 
probably largely Jewish, but it was -- it was 
quite mixed, also. I mean, you know, there wa
s an Irish family and a this family and a 
that family and -- and there was Forbes, th
e black super and -- and there were -- there 
were two ch ildren with birth de
fects. It was very -- It was 
kind of a very mixed bag. And 
now I really start to remember
 things mu ch  mo re cohesively
, so -- so a lot of things 
happened  on this block, you know, right fro
m the beginning. First of all, my  mo ther 
started working in a factory, wh ich was a terr
ible mistak e, but sh 
-- and she worked there 
until she retired, and that was horrible for her. 
And my brother and I went to school. But 
after a fairly short time, I don™t rememb er ex
actly -- it must have 
been like maybe 1944, 
so it™s about three years after we came, my br
other got drafted into the army. That was a 
terrible, terrible event for me and for my moth
er. I mean, you know, we
 just got out of all 
this mess and now my brother is going and 
we didn™t know wh at was going to  happen 
and I-I mean that was just horrible, but -- so 
in the meantime, I star
ted school when we 
moved in  there, and at first that was kind of
 awful, because I couldn™t speak English and 
the kids were always wh
ispering around me and -- 
Q: What did you feel like, they
 were teasing you, or they -- 
were they taunting you, or -- 
A: No, they were just ta
lking about me, I think. 
Q: Who is this girl, sort of? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
14 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, you know, and what 
does she -- how come she doe
sn™t say anything, and you 
know, whatever. But -- 
Q: Did you feel uncomfortable? 
A: Very uncomfortable. 

Q: In what way? I mean, in -- obviously , one can imagine why, but --  

A: Well, I felt, first of all, I felt really differe
nt, I felt really left out. It™s like sitting in a 
room and ee -- there™s a -- there™s a fa
mous painting called ﬁThe Screamﬂ -- 
Q: Der Shrie, yeah. 
A: Yeah, and I think it™s
 sort of that feeling, you know, yo
u sort of want to co ver yourself 
over and -- and disappear, or -- there™s just a 
really uncomfortable situation for a kid. 
Now, I have felt that o ften as an adult, but as 
an adult, it doesn ™t strike you th at way. Give 
you just a -- a trivial example; somehow, in
 our society, you kno
w, you -- you learn 
certain ridiculous things ab
out wh at should be and wh at
 shouldn™t be, and I™ve never 
really paid much attention to that, but still, I 
mean I had never like, gone out to dinner by 
my self. You know, your -- you either don™t go 
out to dinner, I guess, or you -- you know, 
which is ridiculous, cause lo -- lots of 
people go out to dinner by th emselves, now 
especially. But -- Bu t I just had never done th
at, and so 15 years ago, or 13 years ago, 
rather, when I made my career change, and I star
ted doing a lot of traveling, in what I call 
one night stands in not so chea
p hotels, so you know, you -- yo
u get to this place, and you 
register at the hotel, you go
 down and have dinner, you fini
sh doing your homework , you 
go to  sleep, the next day you do your work , 
and you leave. And so
 I was always eating 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
15 
 
 
 
dinner by my self, or almo st always. And at
 first, I found th at extremely uncomfortable, 
like everybody is looking at me, you know, wh
at is this woman doi
ng, you know, eating 
by herself? And I would take a 
book or the newspaper, or -- or 
something, and try to read  
while I was eating. And of course, after a ce
rtain number of years, that whole situation 
turned around. I mean, now, sometimes if I 
-- if the host -- the person who is hosting me 
says, you know, ﬁWould you like to come to 
dinner?ﬂ That™s nice and -- and I often enjo y 
that, but lots of times I feel
 as though, you know
, it™s really a lot more fun eating dinner 
by my self and being able to do 
what I want and leave when I want and -- and not have to  
make polite conversation with somebody who may 
not be that interesting and so on. But, 
as a child, I think it™s hard to co
me to that second station. Yo
u know, you just sort of feel 
you™re alone, everybody™s look
ing at you. And I think that™s 
what I felt a lot, in school. 
Well, I learned English very  quickly. I thin
k -- Within about three 
months, I think I was 
speaking quite fluently. 
Q: That™s amazing. 
A: So -- Well, it was, you kn
ow, a third language. And I th
ink wh en you™re a kid, it™s 
really easy, you know? 
Q: Yeah. And plus, you know, it was so necessary. 
A: It was so necessary. And th
en I did something that my  br
other tried to keep me from 
doing, but I did it anyway, and of course, I™ve re
gretted it ever since, and that is that I 
really tried very hard not to 
speak either German or French
. Now, I had to sp eak German 
to my mother, because she took a long time to
 -- to learn English, and actually for years 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
16 
 
 
 
and years and years, I always 
-- she always wrote to me in German and I -- I think after 
awhile I started -- I -- well, I never learned 
how to really write German, so I think I 
answered in  English, but -- so my  brother 
would say, ﬁDon™t -- You know, practice the 
French, practice the German, don
™t forget it.ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁNo, I don™t -- you know, I 
don™t want to -- I want to just forget all 
that.ﬂ And that was unfortu nate. But anyway , 
that™s -- 
Q: D-Do you not speak German now? 
A: Well, I do, but like a five year old. I m
ean, I can manage when I get there. We -- We 
were just in Switzerland a fe
w weeks ago on a business trip 
and I mean, all the sort of 
daily necessities, I™m -- I™m fine, but I can™
t discuss a book or so
mething, you know, I 
have -- 

Q: Mm. Mm-hm. 

A: So -- And French is -- I mean
, that™s an interesting thing in
 itself, the -- when our kids 
were taking -- I think our daughter took Ge
rman in school and she™d call down and say, 
ﬁMa, how do you say -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: -- Memorial Museum intervie
w with Liane Reif-Lehrer. This
 is tape number one, side 
B. Okay , and you were 
talking about Fren ch. 
A: So French, which I -- as I say I really le
arned to sp eak quite fluently and I went to 
school there, and then  I took it again for, I 
don™t know, a f -- a few years in high school. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
17 
 
 
 
But when I have to sp eak Fren
ch, first of all, it takes me
 longer to get into it, and 
secondly, it™s definitely coming out of my  head, not -- not some gut reaction, and it™s 
harder. So there™s -- there™
s some  difference there, between wh en I learned those 
languages. But anyway, so I learned how to  
speak English, and made some little friends, 
you know, friends in quotes, 
because I don™t -- I mean that™s -- one of the things I™ve 
always been troubled by during
 my life is, what is the defi
nition of real friend? I -- I 
mean, I find that a really -- th
at™s a really -- I mean, my hus
band is a real friend, but I 
have a hard time trying to th
ink about other people. I me an, I -- I guess I don™t have a lot 
of real friends, in my definition. I have a 
lot of acquaintances, and some of them are 
better acquaintances than othe
rs. But God, I™ve probably discussed the topic of what -- 
what is friendship, ad nauseum.  
Q: What -- What -- What is -- What is your 
definition of friendship and how has it been 
formed, do you think, 
by your experience? 
A: I don™t know. I think -- I think -- My husb
and always says that I™m a real romantic, 
and a real idealist at h eart, and so I think 
a real friendship is maybe like the legend of 
Damon and Pythias -- our son is named Da
mon -- where somebody will do ver -- almost 
anything for the other person, an d where, ma
ybe ev en mo re important, and on a day to 
day basis, where the person thin
ks of you almo st as mu ch as
 they thing of themselves, 
and -- [phone ringing] 

Q: Where the person thinks of you as
 much as -- as -- as of themselves. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
18 
 
 
 
A: And where the person is almost totally self
less, with respect to 
-- to the friend. Where 
anything can be discussed, nothing is off limits.
 Anything that™s discussed, is discussed in 
a reasonable, rational way, to be talked ou
t and talked through and it doesn™t engender 
any real anger or permanent scarring, or anyt
hing like that. And I don™t -- I mean, I don™t 
-- I sometimes wonder whether th at sort of rela
tionship really exists to any extent in the 
world. I -- I™m -- I™m n o t -- I™m not sure that 
it does, but I -- I think that -- I feel that 
relationship with my husband, I feel that re
lationship with  my  children, and I feel that 
relationship, but in a funny way, with my  
brother. I th -- My brother and I have an 

emotionally very  close relationship, but I thi
nk in  our -- in our head
s, in the -- in the 
intellectual parts of our heads, we live in so
mewhat different worlds. That™s a whole other 
story, I think, about what happened to us, and about his being older and really being 

much more affected by everything that ha
ppened, but I mean, like 
I can -- well, we both 
like to tell jokes, I mean we -- my  brother and I can sit down and tell jokes for a whole 
evening, but I -- he™s a much more serious 
person. He™s a -- He has a much narrower area 
in wh ich he operates. I think I™m mu ch -- He™s
 -- He™s very tolerant, in the sense that, you 
know, he™s not prejudiced against anything or
 anybody or anything like that, but he™s 
very intolerant about what he
™s willing to do. He doesn™t lik
e to waste his time, whereas I 
th -- I think -- I mean, I™m -- 
I™m pretty serious in many wa
ys also, but I™m much more 
happy go lucky in -- in a way, and I -- I me
an, like yesterday I got a letter from somebody 
who wanted to know if I could help them fi
nd a job, and I -- I mean, this person is like 
way outside of my  -- any area that I conceiva
bly have any contact w
ith, and you know, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
19 
 
 
 
I called him and he wanted to chat and so we
 chatted for a-an -- and also, the-there was 
an article G lobe about me, la -- th e week before 
last, and he wanted  to discuss that, so I -- 
you know, I spent 20 minutes with him. I -- 
I™m not sure, because I don™t see my brother 
on a day to day basis, but I 
don™t think my  brother woul
d have the patience or the 
inclination to do that. But I 
-- I™m not sure. He -- He™s ju st -- He™s much more tied up in 
his work  and wh at he feels he needs to do
, and he does not tend to  do frivolous things, 
whereas I do a lot of frivolous things, even  though mo st of the time, I™m -- you know, I -- 
I live a fairly serious life, but -- 

Q: You -- Do you think it -- I mean, it just oc
curred to me that perhaps this could have 
something to do with -- or ma
ybe not, but -- but perha -- I wa
s just wondering if it might 
have something to do with the fa
ct that since he™s older, his experien ce of the -- the -- the 
brutal meaning of what happened to the family, 
helps create this -- this sort of difference 
in the personalities that you are describing? 
A: Oh a -- Oh, abso lutely, but -- but I think, 
although I don™t know 
th is, I only know this 
from -- from hearsay, but 
my  mo th er alway s to ld  me th at
 my  brother was a very serious 
child, even when  he was two years old. You k
now, that other kids would want to sort of 
play, and he would want to have my  mo ther 
read him the street signs and explain to him 
how that -- why certain words ar
e spelled in a certain way, and -- now, I don™t know wh at 
came first, but I -- I do wonder 
about this, but they started hi
m on violin lessons, I think 
when  he was three years old, and th at didn
't work out, so they stopped him at the 
suggestion of the teacher, and th
en they started again, I th
ink when he was about five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
20 
 
 
 
maybe, or six. And that definitely took and he
 -- h-he would tell you that he™s an amateur 
violinist, wh ich he is, but I think he -- and 
I™m not a musician, so 
I shouldn™t judge, but 
he really plays, you know, quite well. I mean, 
I don™t know that he 
could go out and give 
a concert, but he -- he does play  chamber mu sic with other people and so  on. So  -- And -- 
And I -- And that™s actually one of the things 
that I remember with great pleasure, but -- 

but also something else. When 
we lived in this apartment 
that we moved into in New 
York , my  brother would practice violin, 
often for many, many hours, and I was not 

allowed into the room. But some
times, as a special treat, he 
would let me come in while 

he was playing. And I rememb er I would sit on
 his bed and I would just watch him, in a -
- in absolute silence, and 
I remember sometimes I would 
just -- you know, little tears 
would come, because it -- when he plays the vi
olin, he looks as thou
gh he™s transported 
into some other world, and 
I find that very moving. 
Q: Do you think -- Do you imag
ine what other world th at is? 
A: I don™t know. I think -- I think I think of it 
as some very special wonderful place, that 
he can™t really live in as a real person, exce
pt when he™s playing. But anyway, so -- so 

getting way back to -- to what 
was it like, so we -- so we m
oved into  this place and -- and 
I learned English, and I was going to school
, and I was a -- I was a very good student. 
Now, why was I a very good student? I think 
there were several reasons. One was, maybe 
-- maybe there was just something comforting 
about -- about the logic of school, and the 
things that you learned in school, and -- I mean, I always did my  homework, but I did 
mo re than my  homework. Like wh en we l
earned vocab ulary, or later, when I was, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
21 
 
 
 
know, when  I started taking French, which 
was in high school. I mean, in addition to 
doing my  homework , I -- I would write words 
three time s each, you know, or if -- and 
part of that was also my brother. I mean my  brother -- my  brother was very mu ch of a 
mentor, and so when -- whenev
er I needed any help or anyt
hing, he was there until he -- 
he left, a-and then -- and he also -- I think 
he also used me as a kind of guinea pig, 
because I mean, he was much older, so you 
know, when he was already in high school 
and college, I was -- I was still a little kid. 

Q: Is he what, seven, eight years older? 

A: Seven and a half years older. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And I loved when  he taught me things, so 
I mean, some of the things I rememb er from 
those 1092 President Street y
ears, very often on a Sunday 
mo rning, I would open my  
eyes and my  brother would be standing over 
my  bed with an algebra book. And as soon 
as my -- I o p ened my eyes, he would hop in
to  bed and -- with a pad and paper and this 
algebra book and we would sit there for maybe 
an hour or mo re and he would get me to 

do algebra word  problems. And so I didn™t kn
ow -- and this was ve
ry good for me -- I 
didn™t know that algebra was something that 
na -- that a lot of people didn™t like to do. 
For me, doing algebra word  problems was like
 doing the Sunday crossword puzzle. I 

mean, I thought that was, you know, great. 
But he -- he -- when he learned something 
new, he would come home and 
-- and often try to teach it to 
me, and I really enjoyed that 
most of the time, and I -- I mean, I learned 
an en-enormous amount. I mean, for example, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
22 
 
 
 
he would -- like if my  mo ther needed a new 
plug put on a lamp , he would do that and 
then he would teach me
 how to do that, so -- 
Q: It sounds like he was really, either consciously , or just naturally 
playing the -- the role 
of the man of the family. 
A: Well, that™s what people say, and I don™t 
know, maybe that™s true, but I don™t think I 
ever consciously  or -- thought or him as  a fa
ther, I mean, or even as a father figure. He 
was very serious and he was very strict with 
me, but -- but he was not like any parent that 
I ever met. [phone ringing] 

Q: So you were talking about -- oh you™re
 -- do you recall what you were saying? 
A: Yes. So, my brother --  I mean like, if 
he learned something exciting, he would come 
home -- I -- I mean I remember, 
fo r example, a subway ride in
to to wn  with him, and he 
taught me all about what he had just l
earned about genetics, you know, and crossing 
white Japanese Four O™Clock flowers with 
red ones, and you know, how many red, white 
and pink ones you get, and so 
on. And then  I often used  that for my  own purposes. For 
example, whatever grade I wa
s in, everybody had to give
 a little five minute or 10 
minutes seminar or something. So  I got up th
ere and -- and decided, oh this sounds really 
exciting, I™m going to talk 
about genetics. And I think I was like in third grade or 
something, and I don™t know, kids are funn
y and -- and so I got up there and I said, 
ﬁWell, when  you mate a Japanese, you know re
d Japanese Four O™Cl
ock,ﬂ and so on, and 
the whole class started tittering, and -- and I 
think I was -- I was sort of embarrassed, 
because you know, with my br
other, and I spent a lot of time with his friends at times, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
23 
 
 
 
you know, you talk about, you know, the flower
s mate with each other and so on and so  
forth, but here, in this thirdgla -- grade P.S. 241 -- my  brother always said that P.S. stood 
for poor suckers,  you know 
everybody starts tittering when 
you say this, and so, I mean 
very early, I -- there was this dichotomy that 
happened  in  my  mind ab
out this world that 
my brother lived in, compared 
to this ridiculous world th
at I was living in . The other 
thing that happened to  me in that school was 
that in the one year I went to school in 

Limoge -- in the European system, I learned, except for American history, I learned 
everything that I learned, in the American sc
hool, to the end of fourth grade. So , if I 
weren™t such a dedicated pupil somehow, 
and always interested [phone ringing] 
Q: [inaudible] 

A: So -- So I was -- I was kind of a goody-
goody and I wa -- I always got to be the 
teacher™s pet, and I did all those right thi
ngs and so I somehow got
 -- managed to keep 
interested in school, even though I already 
knew most of this st
uff. And then a funny 
thing happened at some point. My brother 
came home one day and he said, ﬁToday I™m 
going to teach you about probability.ﬂ Now he -- I think he was maybe already in college 

at that point. And I said, ﬁOh Fred, I -- I™m s -- 
I™m -- I™m really ti -- I really don™t want to 
hear about probability 
now.ﬂ And he said, ﬁWell, all ri
ght, then I won™t love you any 
more.ﬂ And -- And I said, ﬁAll right, never mi
nd, just teach me about probability.ﬂ And 
so we had this long lecture ab
out probability, which actually was 
a lot of fun. It™s just that 
I probably  -- I don™t know, I wanted to go out
 and play or -- or 
do something else. So, 
now -- I mean, he didn™t do that very often, but -- but it was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
24 
 
 
 
Q: But it™s a powerful -- 
A: It was a very powerful ploy.  
Q: Does he remember that? 
A: I don™t think so. He doesn™t 
remember a lot of -- I -- one of
 the things that I discovered 
is that when you™re young and impressionable, 
you reme mb er things that older people do 
to you, but they don™t 
remember. You know, I mean like, if
 an adult says blah, blah, blah  
and it hurts you, or -- or pleases you, you reme
mb er it, but to th em 
it was just something 
they said.  

Q: Right. Is your memory that -- I mean, 
is it an upsetting memory
 in a way? I mean 
that™s -- that™s quite a power --  

A: You mean -- 

Q: -- w-wa -- 

A: -- what he said? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: No, not terribly, actually. 
It™s just like haw, all right
, you know? I-It -- It was not 
upsetting. I™ll tell you an upsetting memory fro
m an adult to a child. Not terribly -- Well, 
first of all, when we first m
oved into 1092 President Street, 
in this Brooklyn apartment, 
life was still quite difficult, as it w as for -- for a long time, but it -- it kept getting a little 

better. My mother earned very little and she 
-- I mean she -- she was a real Jewish 
mo ther, you know, everything went to us and 
the last dregs went to her. And so we le -- 
so she went off to work and for 
the first couple of years, I wa
s supposed to report in to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
25 
 
 
 
to some neighbor, but there was another ne
ig hbor who was sort of a busybody. Sh e 
actually had a kid with Do wn ™s Sy ndro me, who 
was kept hidden  in a dark room in her 
apartment, and -- and one day th
e older sister actually took us
 in to see this kid, but I 
mean sh -- but the mo th er, I don -- I don™t kn
ow, the mother just 
-- you know, she might 
have been a perfectly pleasant woman, but sh
e -- she did two things in  -- in the -- those 
first five years we were there, that were re
ally bothersome. Well, first of all, when I 
moved on this block, the kids
 were singing this funny ditt
y that went something like, 
"Da-da da-da dum, Hitler is a 
jerk, Mussolini is a meanie a
nd the Japs are worse.ﬂ And I 
thought that was like rea
lly kind of an awful thing to -- 
to be singing. Bu t she asked me 
one day, ﬁD o you hate the Germ
ans?ﬂ And I sa -- I mentioned 
this on the interview, I -- I 
said, ﬁNo, I don™t hate the Germans.ﬂ And she 
said, ﬁWell, then,ﬂ -- and I said, you know, 
ﬁSome Germans are good and some German s ar
e bad.ﬂ And she said, ﬁWell, why don™t 
you go back to wh ere you came 
from then?ﬂ And then, in Apr
il of 1945, wh
en President 
Roosevelt died, the whole block was, you know
, I mean shocked in the way that I, as an 
adult many, many  years later, when I was 
already, you know, a [indecipherable], the 
whole block was in shock, an
d people were crying and, yo
u know, but I was a little kid, 
and I knew something unpleasan
t had happened, but I wasn™t 
walking around crying or 
anything. I mean, I didn™t -- this -- this figur
e didn™t really mean a lot to me. And this 
woman came out and said, ﬁHow come you™re 
not crying? President Roosev elt just died.ﬂ 
And I -- I -- I don™t think I even answered, 
because I didn™t know what she was trying to 
tell me. And she told me agai
n, she said, ﬁWhy don™t you go back  to wh ere you came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
26 
 
 
 
from?ﬂ So, you know, I mean, 
people were kind of very in
sensitive. Anyway, I -- you 
know, I -- 
Q: Well, let me ask you a little bit about that
. I mean, what -- Do you recall your -- your 
feelings and emotions? Were 
-- Were you shocked, were yo
u horrified, were you scared? 
Did you think th at maybe -- 
A: You mean by her statement? 
Q: By her. I mean, did -- did you feel like 
maybe more people would be telling you this 
and that -- did you actua
lly fear this, or -- 
A: No, I don™t think I feared it, I just -- I thi
nk I just sort of felt th
at this was a really 
unpleasant lady, or maybe I didn™t even feel
 that, maybe I just felt this was a really 
unpleasant thing for her to say. 
Q: Did you have any -- make any attemp t 
to tell her how impossible that would be? 

A: No, I don™t think I said anything, as a ma tter of fact, because from my perspective, 
there was no answer. I mean, you know, what am
 I supposed to do, tu
rn on the tears or -- 
you know, I -- I -- I think 
what she said to me just didn™t make any sense.  
Q: So, th e old America, love it or
 leave it bumper sticker, you know? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Pre -- Pre that, obviously . 

A: Yeah, and th  -- I -- There were a lot of fu
nny th ings that happened to me there. I don™t 
-- I think -- I don™t -- See, I don™t rememb er exactly h-how old I was at each of these 
things, but I sort of made little friendships wi
th people, and there was a little girl called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
27 
 
 
 
Joanie Cummings, who lived  in the next hous
e, and her mo ther was divorced, which was 
pretty unusual at that ti -- there were a fe
w divorced people on th e block, actually, but it 
was still kind of unusual and I remember f -- 
we would talk a lot, I mean she w -- she 
came from -- I mean, I came from 
a family that really treasured, or -- or was intent on 
education, and she came from th e exact oppo
site. You know, her mo
ther worked, I don™t 
know wh ere. She had an older sister who we
nt out with boys and 
-- and you know, kind 
of -- I don™t know, did frivolou
s things, and this kid, Joanie Cummings, she was amazing. 
She played hooky from school mo re days than
 anybody I had ev er met and she always -- 
she would say, ﬁWell, I can™t go to school t
oday, because it™s an Irish holiday  and my  
great-aunt on my mother™s fifth side is Irish, 
so in respect to her, I can™t go to school 
today.ﬂ And for every day she had some -- some
 ridiculous story. Bu t she was kind of -- 

she was nice and -- and pleasant and it was ve
ry informal, they ha
d some kitten in the 
house, the house always smelled absolutely 
awful. But she -- she to
ld me one day, ﬁI 
think I™m going to go play with  this other gi
rl,ﬂ and I can almost remember her name, but 
she lived about a block away, sh
e was blonde and they  were 
both Protestant, and she said, 
ﬁWe have more to -- in comm
on, because we™re both Protestant.ﬂ And -- And I reme mb er 
sort of feeling a little hurt, because we had sp
ent so much time togeth
er. And then sort of 
shrugging my  shoulders and thinking, ﬁWell, 
you know, I don™t know.ﬂ She was also -- 

In our house, I don™t know, I think it was my  brother -- maybe also my  mo ther, but things 

were sort of a little mo re fo
rmal. For example, when my 
brother was young, when he 
came home, and if he didn™t use his key and he
 rang th e bell, and I answered the door, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
28 
 
 
 
would -- he would do th is kind 
of a European bow to me at 
the door, you know, of -- not 
a bow, I don™t know wh at you call it, you know, 
just sort of courtesy bending at the waist 
and -- and he did th at to my  mo ther and -- 
and his -- I mean, his European male friends, 
when they visited each other, 
they -- they -- you know, it -- 
that was kind of formal and 
you came and you didn™t sit 
down unle -- until somebody sa
id, ﬁWould you please sit 
down ?ﬂ You know, and so on. And I rememb er Joanie Cummings one day saying to  me, 
ﬁYou know, I don™t know, wh en  you -- wh en 
I come to your house, everything is so 
formal,ﬂ sh e said, ﬁwhen somebody comes to 
my house, I tell them
 to pull up a comfy 
and squat.ﬂ And I™ve never forgotten that ph rase, because I thought, ﬁOh, y-yeah , you 

know, what™s -- what™s different
 about -- about us?ﬂ And then 
the other thing that I -- that 
I remember from those days is, my brother ha
d taken English lessons 
in Vienna, and -- so 
he kind of had a head  start, 
but he learned English, you know
, fluently, quite quickly after 
we got here. And -- And he spoke quite correc
tly and I -- I never realized it til not too 

long ago, that he even had an accent, it™s a 
v ery slight accent, I think, but-- but when I 
knocked on the door, and he 
-- you know, in New York, ever
ybody that we knew said, 
ﬁWho™s there?ﬂ I think maybe I still do that
. Do I still do that? No, cause we have 
peepholes, but I still, s-sometimes maybe I do 
that, and I had learne
d from the other kids 
to say, ﬁIt™s me,ﬂ cause that™s what all the ot
her kids said. My brother wouldn™t let me in 
if I said, ﬁIt™s me.ﬂ I had to say, ﬁIt is I,ﬂ
 which is correct Englis
h grammar. And then -- 
So I learned to say, ﬁIt is I,ﬂ but then I di
scovered that when  I went to a friend™s house 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
29 
 
 
 
and I said, ﬁIt is I,ﬂ they looked at me in a 
really funny way, and so  I learned to become 
bilingual. 
Q: Bilingual in English. 
A: Yes, bilingual in English, and so  when 
my brother was on the ot
her side of the door, 
or some educated adult, I would say, ﬁIt is
 I,ﬂ but when I was with my little friends, I 
learned to say, ﬁIt™s me.ﬂ And th e funny th
ing was, and -- and I sh
ould have rememb ered 
that, and I -- I didn™t recognize it, and I still 
find it a little difficult, but our daughter, who 
is now a graduate student in
 anthropology, somewhere alon
g the way, learned to speak 
this English that I found it difficult to lis
ten to. Like, Meg and me are going to th e 
movies. But even as a very little kid, sh 
-- and also sh -- she learned it from her little 
friends, to use a lot of bad language. But, at a -- 
it -- this is interesting in terms of kids, at 
a very, very early age, just wh
en she was getting into that st
age, when my brother came to 
visit, she never said things like, Meg and 
me, and she never used any swear wo rds. And 
so somehow, even th ough nothi
ng was said, that I can recall,
 she picked up on this and 
now -- I mean, she writes very well, and she™
s very well spoken , and she is now 29 years 
old and she speaks very well, and if she were 
talking to  you, she wo
uld never say, ﬁMeg 
and me are going to  the movies.ﬂ But wh en  sh
e™s with her friends, who are all now pretty 
well-educated people, she still says, ﬁMeg 
and me are going to the movies.ﬂ But in 
conversation with anybody
 else, she would never use that. So that™s -- 
Q: Well -- Well, you know, I was wondering, 
those -- those couple of examples that -- 
from -- from when you were a kid, I mean, ab
out difference, whether it™s language, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
30 
 
 
 
or these -- this girl saying,
 you know, that we™re Protes
tant. I mean, they™re both 
examples of difference, and one might be mo re, 
sort of steeped in -- 
in the difference of a 
European background, and one steeped in a re
ligious difference of 
being Jewish -- being 
Jewish, so I™m just wondering how mu ch you 
-- I mean it -- living in New York , probably 
you™d perceive it less than in
 other places. Did you -- Did you have a sense of -- of a 
climate of anti-Semitism at all, or -- or were -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- these were just -- 

A: I -- I -- I must say that per -- in my own 
personal life, since comi ng to  the U.S., I have 
never personally experienced any anti-Semiti
sm that I can rememb
er. When I got to 
Berkeley and went out hunting for an apartm
ent, that was 1956 -- I used to get quite 
brown in the summer, and I -- when I went 
looking for an apartm
ent, I went with a 
woman from New Zealand and a Chinese woman, 
we wanted to share an apartment, and I 
found out afterwards, that we didn™t get 
this apartment and we
 happened to know 
somebody who lived  in the building, and th at 
person came and told us that the landlady 

said she didn™t mind the English girl, but she 
didn™t want the Indian
 or the Chinese. The 
Indian was me. So -- And -- And I -- When I 
lived in New York, I 
often -- you know, in 
later years, when more and 
more Hispanics moved in, I of
ten was mistaken for being 
Hispanic, so I mean, I just, 
you know, I -- I -- I have not 
personally experienced any anti-
Semitism, but -- but other prejudices, I mean, 
for example, on my block, my brother and I 
-- and there was one other -- there was one other 
kid th at I played with who did later go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
31 
 
 
 
college and become a teacher, but my  brother 
and I and one other bo
y were the only three 
people wh o went to graduate school, and so  th
ere definitely was -- well, my mother also -
- my mother, I think, in a fu
nny way en -- I hate to say en
couraged this, cause I don™t 
think she encouraged it, she ju
st -- I think my mother was 
very proud or something ab out 
-- about being from a, 
you know, quotes, good family a
nd -- and you know, being fo r that 
time, educated. I mean, my  mo ther -- my  mo
ther finished  gimn asium, which was unusual 
in her generation for a female, 
and that™s kind of the equi
valent of finishing junior 
college, I guess, in the U.S. She was very pro
ud of that and -- that she could always read 
and that she read good books and that she liste
ned to music and -- and so  on and so forth. 
So there certainly -- I mean, I certainly grew up 
with an air of her having a sense that we 
were -- I hate to use the word better, but that
 -- but that there was something special about 
us, compared to oth -- the 
-- everybody else on the --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Liane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape
 numb er two, side A. Ok ay. 
A: My brother also -- I mean, my  brother wa
s -- was very, very interested in education 
and -- and things of the head. And so -- I mean, 
he taught me a lot of things and he also -- 
he would, you know, he would 
test me, but not in -- in an unpleasant way, it was -- it was 
kind of mo re of a game, you know. Music would -- We always listened to WQ XR  in 
New York, which was the classical music st
at ion, and, you know, ﬁWho wrote that?ﬂ 
You know, and readin g -- about 
reading good books, and he 
did not allow me -- this -- 
my  --  my  one really bad thing that I did in
 the growing up years, my  brother did not 
allow me to read comic books.
 And the only re -- the only bad thing I ever did is, I had 
six classic comics hidden un
der my  bed at one point. 
Q: That you insisted on being a real girl? 

A: I wa -- that was -- 
Q: You know, a normal girl, you know? 

A: -- that was my one rebellious thing, right.
 And to th is day, you know, I can™t really 
read comics. I find them ju
st really annoying. But -- 
Q: Wa -- So -- So he was really demanding 
excellence of you, it sounds like. He -- He 
wanted to -- He wanted you to be better a
nd better, an-and achieve, it sounds as though 
that™s his motivation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
33 
 
 
 
A: He -- He -- He did, and he also, I mean
, I think I owe, in many ways, wh ere I am 
educationally or professionally or whatever, to  
him. First of all, there was -- there was -- I 
don™t ever rememb er having to make decision
s, like decisions that 
I™ve seen my children 
and other kids make about, you know, am 
I going to  college, which college? What am I 
going to do afterwards, etcetera. And I -- I certa
inly had to decide on which co llege, but 
there -- I don™t remember ever questioning that I would go to  grad uate school. I mean, it 
was never discussed, it was just somehow there.
 And my brother, I mean actually, in this 
family, even -- even my
 husband, we -- we have a -- a -- 
an incredible surfeit of teaching 
genes. I mean, we are -- there is ju st the desi
re to always be teaching. I mean my -- my 
husband™s always teaching, my brother™s al
ways teaching, I™m always teaching. And I 
reme mb er, you know, when  I started taking 
chemistry, I reme mb er my  brother coming 

home and teaching me, you know, how do you
 do -- how do you make a diagram of 
water in a beaker? And I -- I -- I even remember
 that he had a blue -- a -- a sort of aqua 
blue pencil that he was drawing these lines
 in with. You know, 
how do you -- you know, 
what™s a triangle, how do you bi
sect an angle? Learning th
e multiplication tables, I mean 
f -- oh, I know, then -- okay, then my brother went off -- my brother went to -- started at 
City  College. Then he got -- oh
 here™s an interesting story,
 he got a Pulitzer scholarship. 
Didn™t tell my mother 
about it, didn™t tell me about it, ei
ther. My mother 
read about it in 
the newspaper.  
Q: Why? Why wouldn™t he say? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
34 
 
 
 
A: Because he was a very private person, an
d he still is. He does not -- He doesn™t -- I 
mean, like if I got a Pulitzer scholarship, I 
would probably  be out 
telling all my friends. 
You know, I wouldn™t advertis
e it in the newspaper, but I would tell all my frien ds. My -- 
First of all, my brother doesn ™t talk about th
ings until they have happ
ened, because, as he 
says, they may not happen. And th en, he does 
not advertise. So -- So
 anyway, so then he 
got this Pu litzer scholarship, and so he tran
sferred to Columbia University. And after one 
year is when he got drafted. 
So he got drafted into th e army , and he went to -- I don™t 
know, Fort something or other, 
in Florida. My  brother is probably  the mo st un-athletic 
person I have ever met. So he
 had to got to basic training,
 and he was miserable and he 
fainted out in the sun, and you 
know, and then he tells this 
funny story about the day they  
were supposed to have grenade training, he
 ended up in the infirmary with a -- a fever 
and didn™t get out until after 
grenade training was over, or 
something. Okay , so he got 
finished with basic training, they sent him to
 Yale to study Japanese. So, he was at Yale 
Univ ersity for nine months, learning Japanese, 
which was totally useless, but he liked that 
better than having to  do some other thing, th at didn™t involve his brain. And then he got 

sent -- he was going to get sent overseas a
nd he got shipped out to
 Seattle and then the 
war ended. And -- But he
 had only been in the army now
 for, I don™t know, a little over a 
year and he was supposed to be in for 18 
months at least, or -- I -- you know, I don™t 
know what the rules were, but -- so he wa
s -- I think he was private first class or 
something. He got shipped to
 Texas, and they put him in
to MP school, military police 
school. Well, that was definitely not my brot
her™s cup of tea, but I remember when he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
35 
 
 
 
came home, I was on the floor constantly, caus
e he -- he had learned all these maneuvers 
about how to  thro w people over his shoulder, 
and so on, and he pr
acticed them on me. 
Okay, so that -- So that was the end of that. 
Then he went back to 
Co lumb ia for one year, 
and managed to somehow make up classes and he
 -- he really was a self studier and so -- 
I mean, he tells funny stories. I™ve interv
iewed him, you know, like you™re interviewing 
me, and he -- he tells the story about, you know, 
he had to take this course, and he really 
didn™t want to take the course and a friend of
 his said, ﬁOh, you don™
t have to take this 
course, just go and read  this book and pass th e exam.ﬂ So he did an
d he passed it, and -- 
and he -- he was very bright and -- okay, so th
en he got out of Co lumb ia and then he left 
to go to Harvard, as a graduate student 
in physics. So -- I was going to tell you a story 
and now it™s eluded me.  
Q: Well we can -- We can get back to it if you want. 

A: Okay, all right. 
Q: I -- I -- Ba -- Wa -- Once you™re not trying
 to remember it, maybe it™ll pop -- it™ll be -- 
pop in. 
A: Yeah. No, I was trying to -- It 
was straight -- something about -- 
Q: His -- 

A: His -- 

Q: I think we were talking about his seriousness. 

A: Yes, and something that he
 -- oh, oh, okay, all right, so 
he went up to  Harvard and I 
was here, and I -- I guess by that time I was 
starting high school, and -- and tw o fu nny 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
36 
 
 
 
things happened. One is, I got this teacher 
at one point, this math teacher who had a 
terrible reputation fo r being really mean, an
d -- and I was always the teacher™s pet and 
everybody -- all the teachers were always nice
 to me, cause I always did my  homework  
and I studied and I always did the right thi
ng, and -- you know, and th ere was a teacher 
even, Miss Massamine, I had, I think, in seve
nth grade or something, and she was really 
kind of a disgusting character. She always wo
re black dresses and if you were really 
good, you got to dust the da
ndru ff off her shoulders. And that -- that totally, you know -- 
but anyway -- but I -- but I -- 
Q: What an incredible privilege that wa -- 
A: -- was going -- 
Q: -- mu st have been. 

A: I know. But anyway, so -- 
so Miss Carter was going to be
 the teacher for algebra or 
something, and ev erybody told  me Miss Ca
rter was really mean, and I -- so I was 
panicked , I wrote to my  brother and I said, ﬁY
ou know, I™ve be
en put into th
is class with 
this mean teacher.ﬂ Got this 
letter back from my brother, sa
id, ﬁI had Miss Carter,ﬂ sh -- 
he said, ﬁdo your work  and mind your own bus
iness, she™s fine.ﬂ And -- So that™s what 
happened , I did my  homework and minded my  own business and she was fine. I mean 

she was -- she was really kind
 of an ogre, but she never did anything bad to me. But I 
used to sit there, I mean, when she yelled at 
other kids, I™d be, you know, I mean I -- that 
was really -- okay, then I started also taki
ng French in high school,
 and the first French 
quiz, I got a 98. So  I was pretty pleased with my self, cause the other kids, you know, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
37 
 
 
 
mean, by and large, the kids in that s-school 
-- I me an, there were some very bright kids, 
but mo st of them were, you know, they didn™t 
really care. So I wrot
e to my brother with 
great pride, I got a 98 on my first French qu
iz. I get a very stern letter back from my 
brother. ﬁYou obviously  didn™t 
study. Language is an exac
t science, and if you had 
studied, you obviously would have gotten a hu
ndred.ﬂ So  I went back to the drawing 
board s and I studied, and th e next quiz I got a 
hundred. So -- But, so he was very -- he 
was very stern, in that sense, but he was also 
-- but he was also very
 nice and he was a lot 
of fun. You know, we used to play games t
ogether and -- I mean, wh
en  he was still home 
and we were younger, we used 
to have -- we used to duel w
ith rolled up New York Times 
magazines and there was someth
ing fu nny that happened in th
e house, an-and the stupid 
thing was, it never occu rred to me to protes
t, but we had an apartment that had two 
bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. My  
brother got his own bedroom, I slept in the 
master bedroom with my  mo ther, in what used 
to be my father™s bed, and I studied in the 
kitchen, or some -- later on -- in later years, 
in the living room. Wh en my  brother left for 
Harvard, his room remained and now, as I thi
nk back on it, it sort of
 was like a shrine or 
something. I mean, I didn™t -- I 
didn™t go in there, I didn™t 
do my homework in there, I 
didn™t -- you know, I -- 
Q: Why do you think th at was? 

A: I don™t know, but in recent years I™ve writt
en to my brother an
d I™ve said, ﬁYou know, 
why didn™t I use your room? Why didn™t I m
ove into your room?ﬂ And my  brother says, 
ﬁI don™t know. Why didn™t you 
just do it?ﬂ You know, he™s -- 
it had nothing to do with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
38 
 
 
 
him, maybe it was something to do with my 
mo ther, but that room was kept empty for 
the, you know, one week at holid
ay s when  he would co me home. 
Q: I™ve decide -- I don™t want to overanalyze 
or over-pursue this point, but I -- I™m just 
thinking, how mu ch  of the presence of yo
ur father was he -- do you think he was 
representing, especially in that sort
 of shrine that you™re describing? 
A: You know, people ask -- I don™t think, I don
™t think -- I mean, my  br -- my  father had 
his own shrine, there was a photograph of my  fa
ther on my  mo ther™s night-table and that 
was like the shrine, and -- and th e shrine was 
in my mother™s head, but it was not in my 
brother™s room. I mean, I don™t know what it 
was, but I mean, in -- you know, it -- and it 
never occurred to me for all 
these years, until abou
t -- it must have been about five or 
seven years ago, that I suddenly  thought, 
ﬁWhy didn™t somebody suggest that I take over 
my brother™s room when he left for college
?ﬂ And I, you know, I don™t know th e answer, 
but -- 
Q: Well let me ask -- let me -- may b e we co
uld just pick up on -- 
on what -- I just am 
curious that -- you talked about there was a 
shrine, your mo ther had a shrine for your 
father and  wh-wh-what -- what presence of yo
ur father did you feel
? I mean, did you feel 
a -- a terrible -- something that 
was terribly missing, did you 
-- were you conscious of it? 
Did you feel like, oh, I don™t have a fathe
r, when you were grow
ing up? Or -- How did 
you feel about that? 
Q: I don™t -- I don™t rememb er -- I mean, I rememb
er staring at my  father™s picture, but I 
don™t rememb er, through all those growing up 
years, really thinking very much about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
39 
 
 
 
It was only very much later that I became cu
rious in a number of things. On e was, did my  
father really commit suicide? Ev
erybody sort of assume d that, but maybe that™s not wh at 
happened . And my  brother says, ﬁWell, it pr
obably did happen,ﬂ but -- but anyway , but I 
still have that question in my mind.  
Q: Like somebody might have th
rown him over the stairwell? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Given the climate of --  
A: Right. 

Q: -- of the time? 
A: Exactly, but --  
Q: I mean, that was how long after -- it was -- 

A: It was actually before Kristallnacht -- 

Q: -- it was just before 
Kristallnacht, yeah, yeah. 
A: -- right, but it was after the August when he was forced to s -- close his practice. 

Q: It was af ter the anschluss. 

A: It was af ter the anschluss. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The other thing is I -- I™ve -- I just, not to
o many years ago, said to my  brother, ﬁIf my  
father loved me as mu ch as they say he di
d, why didn™t he leave me a note if he was 
going to  commit suicide? Why di
dn™t he sort of introduce 
himself and explainwhy he 
was doing th is?ﬂ And my  brother pointed out, qu
ite correctly, that when people are very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
40 
 
 
 
depressed, and they ™re about to commit suicid
e, they don™t necessarily act in a rational 
way. 
Q: Yeah. But that -- Does that -- 
Is it a -- Is it a -- Is it a -- 
What kind of my stery is that 
for you, does it -- does it dig at you, or is 
it a -- sort of a curiosity
? I mean, how much do 
you -- how deeply, I guess I™m 
a s king, do you wish to be 
able to somehow find the 
answer to that? 

A: Subconsciously, I can™t answer. Consciously
, not terribly, but it -- I think maybe it™s 
getting ev er so slightly mo re as I get olde
r. For example, my cous
in, this woman Hilda 
Towderer, wrote a letter to me 
a week ago, and at the end of
 the letter, she wrote a couple 
of things about, ﬁI remember you as a little gi
rl at our house,ﬂ and so on, and I thought, 
ﬁOh, why haven™t I ever tapped her for inform
ation befo re?ﬂ So wh
en I answered that 
letter a couple of days ago, you know, I wr
ote like 10 questions at
 the end, about, you 
know, what was my father like, what was 
the relationship between my  father and my  
mo ther, etcetera, etcetera. I mean, I just 
-- you know, I was at the compu -- I mean, you 
have to understand that I live my
 life, really very much in the present, and I™m always in 
a hurry, because I™m trying to 
do more things, alwa
ys, than there is time to do. And now, 
for the first time in my adult 
life, because our son has been 
ill since the end of October, I 
haven™t worked full time. I me
an, I™m trying to work, take care of him. You know, my 
husband and I are taking tu rns doing this. You kno
w, we travel -- he doesn™t travel a lot, 
but he travels, and -- and I travel a fair am
ount, and so we live a life which is generally 
very hectic, I think. But not hectic the way -- 
I mean, I have a lot of -- I spent most of my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
41 
 
 
 
career as a faculty member at Boston Biomed
ical and then The Eye Research Institute, 
and always with an appointment at Harvard 
Medical School, and so  I don™t -- I™m not like 
your average Harvard tenured professor, wh
ose life is very limited to getting ahead, 
doing [indecipherable], you know, [indeciph
erable] you know, and not -- not doing 
anything else. My husband and I try to do all t
hose things, but we also both have a lot of a 
-- outside interests. For example, we like to 
ballroom dance. My husb
and used to like to 
do photography, he do
es very little of that now, but -- but we have other things that we™re 

interested in doing. So, I™m -- We™re -- We ar
e not ever hectic to the point of excluding 
those things. In fact, I mean I wouldn™t tell 
my colleagues this, but I usually call at the 
beginning of the season, wh en the ballroom da
nce schedule comes out and I put that on 
my calendar first. And then 
if somebody calls and says, 
you know, ﬁCan you come to 
Chicago and do a wo rkshop?ﬂ I say, ﬁWell, 
no, I™m sorry. I™m -- I™ve already got a date 
that day,ﬂ you know.  

Q: Well that™s priorities. I mean, you --  
A: So --  

Q: -- you make decisions of -- like that as --  
A: Right, and I --  
Q: Most people don™t do th at these days. 

A: -- I don™t -- I don™t know why, but I have a -- I think since my  son got sick, and -- we 

have not gone to any of th
e really big dances this ye
ar, since he got sick, but -- 
Q: Bless you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
42 
 
 
 
A: And now -- thanks -- now I find that -- I me
an, since he got sick, my priorities have 
changed again, because now, if I miss a danc
e, it doesn™t even, you know, it doesn™t -- but 
a year ago, I mean, I w ould lik
e, bend over backwards not to 
miss a dance. Why am I so 
passionate about ballroom dancing? I don™t kn
ow. I mean I -- that™s -- you know, I mean 
people ask me and I jokingly say, ﬁWell, it™
s my  Viennese blood.ﬂ Well, that™s a lot of 
bullshit. I -- You me -- I mean, I d on™t really
 have any Viennese bl
ood. My  parents were 
born in Poland, they  moved to Vienna. Why 
do I have th at? I don™t know. I think my  
parents did dance. Oh , and then , you know, 
the other thing is, wh en we came here, the 
only thing I had, wh ich I still have, is a wi
nd-up phonograph, that my parents had. And 
we brought, from Vienna, I don™t know, ma
ybe two dozen 78 rp
m records, mostly 
popular songs of the day. So , my  brother said I couldn™t  listen to any of this music, and 
the only -- there were only two or three reco
rds he let me listen to, they were Strauss 
waltzes, because -- not that my brother is en
amored of Strauss waltzes, but that was the 
closest thing to classical music th at was inthat collection. So, I remember when I was a 

kid, when I was alone, and after I™d finished 
my  homework -- I mean, I did go out to play 
with the kids, but I really also spent a fa
ir amount of time by my self. I™d put this 
phonograph on and I would either -- we had a ca
rpet in the living room, an oriental carpet 
that had sort of a design, you know, with a -- 
with a sort of pattern around the edge and I 
would march in time to the mu sic around th is
 thing. Sometimes my  brother would -- my  

brother doesn™t dance, but he would -- he wo
uld do a gavotte with me. A gavotte, which 
is a -- sort of a 1600™s dance. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
43 
 
 
 
Q: A little more like a march, sort of, or -- 
A: No. 
Q: No? 
A: A very formal court dance --  

Q: Ah, uh-huh. 

A: -- sort of thing, and -- and then I starte
d taking Arthur Murray footprint books out of 
the library. Oh, you know, another thing th at ha
ppened -- see, I  spen
t a lot of time with 
my  brother when  he was still home, and we 
lived about a 15 minute 
very fast walk from 
the Grand Army Plaza Librar
y in Brooklyn, wh
ich was a wonderful library. And my 
brother spent a lot of time in the library, andhe would take me along, but officially, I was 

still too young to go into the 
adult section. I don™
t think libraries do this any more, but -- 
but in those days there was a children™s libra
ry and you couldn™t go in to the adult section 
unless you were a certain age. So, first of all,
 my  brother walked ve
ry, very fast, and so, 
when  I started walking with him, I™d kind of 
be dragging, you know, down  the street. But 
so, what do you do? I learned how to walk. I 
am probably the fastest walker of anybody 
that I know, even now. I mean, I can out-walk
 practically anybody. And so I learned to 
walk very fast, and -- and then later in life 
it kind of turned  around, I mean, my  brother 
has some foot problems an-and other, you know
, things, so he -- he no longer walks fast 
and so -- so now, you know, everybody else i n
 the family usually says, ﬁCould you please 
slow down?ﬂ But -- But so we would walk  to
 the library very  often and because I was 
with him, he could take me into the adult sec
tion. Bu t he didn™t really want to be bothered 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
44 
 
 
 
with me once we got into the adult section, 
so he would drop me at the first set of 
bookshelves in the adult section, which happ
ened to be psychology.
 And so I would sit 
on th e floor for hours, while he was doing his thing, and I would rummage through the 
psychology books. And usually, what was on 
the bottom shelf was about optical illusions, 

so I learned a lot about optical illusions. So  -- So a lot of me was formed by -- not 

intentionally, ba -- by my  brother, but just
 because I was around him and -- you know, 
and then, I mean, if his friends came and they
 were going to the Museum of Modern  Art, 

I mean the first time I ever 
went to  the Mu seum of Modern Art was because my  brother 
was going with a friend an
d he took me along.  
Q: Did -- I™m just curious, th-the optical illu
sions that you learned about, did that -- do 
you see any connection tha -- between that an
d your later professional development, or 
just -- 

A: No, I don™t think so, no. 
Q: No. So -- 
A: Well, except -- except that I can never deci
de, did I get interested in science because 
science was interesting, or because my  brothe
r made science interesting, or because my  
brother got me interested in sc
ience, or another -- I mean, the 
reality is that I was able to 
get a fellowship to graduate 
school, which co vered all my  
expenses, living and school 
and ev erything, because in those years, a lot 
of money was being poured into science. I 
mean, it is now, but it -- but it was much more
 so then. Did my  brother go in to science 
because he knew that that was 
a good way to get out of the gh
et-ghetto in which we lived, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
45 
 
 
 
in Brooklyn, and I just followed? Or was 
there some other, deeper, mo re meaningful 
things that were going on, or 
was it just because my  brother taught me a lot of science 
and science was fun and I seemed to be go
od at it and you know, there™s nothing that 
succeeds like success? I mean, who 
knows? I™ve had a lot of discussions in recent year -- 
well, not a lot, but I™ve had discussions in 
recent years with my  brother about something 
that I find extremely disturbing and very  horri
fying. And that is that when  I sit down and 
analyze what happened to me in my  life and 
what happened to my  
brother, although he™s 
had a much more difficult life, that our lives
 were probably better in the long ru n, and 
more exciting, and more fulfilli
ng because of those things that
 happened, than they would 
have been if nothing -- if there had been  no 
war and we stayed in Vi
enna. That™s kind of a 
horrible thought, that -- that our lives were e
nhanced at the cost of so much tragedy, to 
such an en ormous numb er of people. That™s
 a -- That™s a very di
fficult thought to live 
with.  
Q: It™s a profound kind of realization, I suppo
se. It -- Did it sort of just dawn on you at 
one point, or -- 
A: You know, until 1974-ish, I really did not think about a
ny of the past. When people 
tried to talk to me about it, I 
just said, ﬁOh, I was too young,
 that had no effect on me.ﬂ I 
was intr -- I had blinders on, I just wanted 
to  get on with my  career, I wanted to do my  
thing, I wanted to get out of that place in
 Brooklyn. I wanted to get away from those 
people that I grew up with. 
I wanted to get to a better place. When I got to Barnard 
College, that™s another interesting story, how 
did I manage to get to
 Barnard College, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
46 
 
 
 
when I got to Barnard College, I remember fe
eling sad. I -- I felt sad that, why couldn™t I 
ha -- you know, there were these all -- I mean
, this was by no mean
s the rule in those 
days, because by and large, women didn™t do 
much in those days, but I met a lot of 
women at -- the first y ear at Barnard whos
e parents were lawyers and whose mo thers 
were lawyers or doctors and you know. I mean, 
overall, I think most of the mothers were 
housewiv es, but -- but my  head focused in on
 why couldn™t I have a mo ther who was a 
doctor or a lawyer, and I -- that really bothere
d me, that my  mo ther had not ch osen to do 
something important. Now, my  brother was very 
partial to my father, and he tells me it™s 
because, you know, my father was doing important, good thin
gs, my mother was 

frivolous. She was interested in fashion an
d you know. And so mehow, in recent years, 
I™ve tried to tell him, ﬁBut look at -- look at
 how she came through 
when  the ch ips were 
down .ﬂ 
Q: That™s -- It -- You could see her as a hero
ic figure in -- in keeping the family together. 
A: Yes, well I didn™t when  she was still ar
ound, but I do now. Bu t I think -- I think my  
brother appreciates everything 
she gave up and everything that
 she did, but he certainly 
does not see her as a heroic figure. He sees
 her as somebody who was pulled into being 
heroic by circumstances, but who, having -- 
if she had been left to her own devices, 
would have been, you know, dressing up 
and putting on make-
up and -- and having 
coffee klatches and so on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
47 
 
 
 
Q: But -- But what -- what does 
-- I mean --  here -- I mean if -- if -- if -- if you™re -- think 
about heroism, I mean, what -- 
doesn™t what count -- wha -- is
 -- is wh -- when -- when it 
really come s down to how you 
respond, in a sense, right? 
A: Well -- 
Q: I mean, she sounds lik
e she really responded. 
A: Yes, and I think he really appreciated th
at, but I don™t think he really respected the 
inner person that she was or would have been
 if this event hadn™t happened. He really 
respected my father. My father, he says, did 
good things for people. He was thoughtful, 
he was, you know, he -- he educated himself. 
So h-he -- you know, it™
s funny, my  brother 
got himself so educated  and was never interest
ed in small talk or 
anything like that. So 
another thing th at happened  between him and my
 mother was that it got
 to a point fairly 
early, when they really almost couldn™t talk
 to each other, because my  brother didn™t 
know small talk and my  mo ther couldn™t ta
lk physics or philo so
phy, or you know, 
whatever. And he was -- he was nice to her, I 
mean, he wasn™t mean or anything like th at, 
but he just really didn™t have anything in
 common with her. I-It was -- It™s funny, it™s 
kind of a scary thing, I mean, i-if y ou™re 
a parent, you know, who are your children, I 
mean, and what do they 
turn out to be and is there any rule
 that says they have to be like 
you, or th at -- you know. And it always hurt
s me when I hear these stories, but for 
example, my -- my Ph.D. thesis advisor has 
one son and he -- the last time I saw him, 
which was, I don™t know, maybe seven or eigh
t years ago, he said, ﬁWell, I see my  son 
once a year. We go fishing together, alone, for 
a week.ﬂ He said, ﬁI
 don™t like the woman 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
48 
 
 
 
my  son married. We have nothing in commo n, 
we don™t have a lot to, you know, to do 
with each other. We enjoy our annu
al fishing trip, and that™s it
.ﬂ Well, to me th at™s very 
sad, and I mean, my  husband an d I are very in
volved  with both our kids, I mean, maybe 
too much involved, but I 
like to think that we are also not
 just parents -- I mean, that we 
are also, I don™t know, friends
 or something, I don™t know. But -- But I mean, I think 
we™ve also really worked at that and I thi
nk maybe, you know, why di
d I work at that so 
hard? And I think th at was conversations my  
brother and I had early, about parenting. I 

mean, I rememb er one day having a conversa
tion with my  brother bef -- I think it was 

before he went off to college, about -- and my 
brother said to me, ﬁA
 child is like a ship. 
When you finish building it -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning of Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Liane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number
 two, side B. And you were saying? 
A: My brother said that a child should be lik
e a ship, and that when  you finish build ing 
the ship, and you crack the ch
ampagne bottle over the bow, 
or whatever, and you send it 
out to sea, that you have to be confident 
that you™ve done a good job build ing the ship, 
and that it will not sink, that it will sail 
under it™s own steam, and that you th en can™t 
continually watch out for it and you know, sort 
of be trying to tell 
it where to go and what 
to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

Q: He said this wa -- before he 
was a parent? When he was in -- 
A: He™s not a parent, he™s never been a parent. 
Q: He™s never been a parent? 
A: And he said that to me, I 
think it was when he was still in
 college, because he was still 
home. And I always rememb ered 
that. So, very early on -- firs
t of all, I wasn™t going to  
have any kids either. That -- What I -- I wa
s d efinitely not going
 to have any kids. 
Q: Why? 

A: Well, actually, when I grew
 up with my brother, I mean, 
I sort of grew up with the 
idea that we were never going to get married
, we were just going to be these dedicated 
scientists and we were not going to  have a ma
rriage, or children, we would just be these 

career folks. At some point my brother me
t a young woman and th
ey ended up getting 
married, and that was a very , very, very difficu
lt time in my life, becau
se I felt -- I felt as 
though I had been  deceived 
somehow. I just -- See, I th
ink one of the things that 
happened , is when my  brother was home, we we
re pretty close and we -- we talked a lot, 
but the one thing I didn™t realize until way later, is
 that I talked a lot 
more than he talked. 
And I didn™t realize how private 
a person he was, and so, as 
he went through his traumas 
in life, like the army, and you 
know, all the things that happen as you™re a young person 
growing up, he didn™t share those things with
 me. He taught me a lot of stuff and so on, 
but he didn™t -- he didn™t take the opportunity
 to teach me about wh
at I call the sort of, 
real life skills. And so, I thi
nk -- I think wh en he was going 
to get married, I mean that 
just ki -- was like something totally out of
 the blue, and I -- I think I -- I remember 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
50 
 
 
 
writing that this -- I remember writing very dr
amatic things at that point. I don™t know, 
maybe I™ll find them someday if we ever clean 
out the house, but I remember feeling that 
this was like the fall of -- I remember writing 
something about that 
I felt like, ﬁThe Fall 
of the House of Usher,ﬂ that I guess I™d been
 reading Poe at the time, but -- and I had 
really morbid thought 
about, you know, that 
-- that my  brother was sort of deserting the 
plan, or -- I mean, I -- you know, I -- I don™t know. 
Q: And deserting y
ou probably , too. 
A: Maybe deserting me, I don™t know.  
Q: I mean, I wonder if -- if -- if
 just -- I mean, this 
-- this experience that you shared, this 
-- this -- this leaving Vienna, and this -- this
 fleeing for your lives. I mean, may b e -- I™m 
just wondering if maybe part of it was that he
 was the only person out there who really 
knew, like you did, wh at you 
had gone thro ugh. And who kn
ew even more, because he™s 
older. And that there was something -- th
at maybe you felt abandoned for that. 
A: Yeah. I mean, I really shouldn™t have, it™s 
just that he didn™t make me sufficiently 
aware of his inner life and -- or I don™t know, 
maybe it was more than just his inner life, 
but fo r example, he had a -- he had a very 
in teresting thing happen , which I only barely 
mentioned in the in -- in th
e video interview. When  we 
got to France, and I can™t 
remember which town, I think -- I don™t reme
mber which town it was, but anyway, he 
met this -- this young man, who was prob
ably 20-something, who was a pianist, a 
professional p-pianist, from Poland. Also Jewi
sh and ap parently did not make it through 
the war. This guy had a room somewhere and so
 okay, it mu st have been in Limoge. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
51 
 
 
 
invited my  brother to come and stay with hi
m for, I guess a month or so. And so this guy 
was 21, which in those days was quite an adult 
age. You know, 21 now is not as adult as I 
think 21 then. So th is guy had fled Po land an
d was totally on his own, and so he kind of 
knew a little bit about the ropes, cause he ha
d already been there, I don™t know for, you 
know, weeks or months, whatever it was. And 
so he to ok my  brother under his wing, and 
he said, ﬁOkay, so, you know, what would you
 like to do?ﬂ And my brother said, ﬁWell, 
I™d like to go to school.ﬂ And so he said
, ﬁWell, you know, there™
s a school on such and 
such a street, why don™t you go down th ere a
nd register?ﬂ And so my brother went down  
there and -- and he -- he -- when I was intervie
wing him in recent years, he said, ﬁI was 
the only kid in the school who was not bein
g registered by parents. I was the only one 
who was on my  own,ﬂ and -- and he said, ﬁso I got
 into this class, w ith this nice guy, who 
happened  to  be the headmaster,ﬂ Monsieur 
Nabout was his name, 
N-a-b-o-u-t. And in 
that class, kids got seated acco
rding to their grades. So my br
other started in the last seat. 
And apparently, within like two or three months
, my brother was sitting in the first seat, 
and -- and Monsieur Nabout al
so took my  brother under his 
wing and sort of, you know, 
kept him after school, and helped  him with his French, and his this and that and so on. So  
that was a really positive thing, and then 
th is guy one day said, ﬁWell, so, you know, 
what else would you like to do?ﬂ And my  brot
her said, ﬁWell, I play the violin, and I 
have my violin and -- and I -- I™d like to take
 some lesso ns.ﬂ And so, he said, ﬁWell, you 
know, on such and such a st
reet, there™s this music cons
ervatory,ﬂ you know, ﬁget 
yourself over there.ﬂ And -- And somehow my brother went there and I guess he got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
52 
 
 
 
lessons and they mu st have given him lessons 
free, or I -- I don™t 
know how, but anyway 
he, you know. So, this guy, I think was very 
formative in helping my  brother grow up. I 
mean, my  brother had already 
grown up very quickly , cause he
 had to do -- he spoke a 
little French. My mother knew 
no French and I knew no Fren
ch. So he was -- I mean, 
once we got to France, he was in charge of all 
the official things that
 had to be done. So  
that was a really fast growi
ng up. But in addition, there wa
s this other stuff growing up, 
and that stuff I didn™t see, and I don™t thin
k my  brother really -- I mean, why would he 
come home and tell this little seven and a half ye
ar old younger sister 
about this stuff that 
was going on? So I -- I wasn™t aware of -- of all 
that other stuff that went on. And th en, of 
course, in -- when we got here, and when 
my  brother was at Columb ia, he got some 
friends, and I -- I remember like one night, my
 brother took me with him to the -- I mean, 
this is -- my brother almo st never did this, but
 he went to this friend™s house, and there 
were a lot of other young men there, and here
™s this little sister. 
And they were playing 
cards, which I don™t think my  br
other did very  often, and certa
inly I™m sure he never did 
it as a -- you know, as a real adult. But I just sa t in the back of this 
guy™s apartment with a 
-- I think my  brother bro-brought a book fo
r me, or something, and I just sat there 
reading. But I wasn™t just reading, I was l
ooking up at all these big guys, you know, and 
they were joking and playing cards and -- an
d the thing that my  brother did, which I 
always felt -- I me an, it was -- it was very 
difficult being alone in that, you know, this 
little girl sitting there, you 
know, no friends, just watching 
these big guys having a good 
time. But in a funny way, I didn
™t really ever feel lonely, 
because you know, I™d kind of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
53 
 
 
 
sneak glan ces up at the boys and sort of every fifth glance or 10
th
 glance, whatever it was, 
my  brother would lo ok up and wink at me with 
this wonderful smile. So
 that I always had 
a feeling that I wasn™t really alone, you know,
 and that he -- he hadn™t just forgotten 
about me. So, and -- and then 
-- I mean, he would close himself in his room in our 
apartment at 1092 President 
and he would be doing his ho
mework , or practicing his 
violin and I would be at -- firs
t of all, if I wanted to come
 in, I had to knock. But -- And 
he didn™t like me to knock too often, cause 
I would disturb his conc
entration. So  I would 
be sitting in the kitchen, doi
ng my homework, but every -- 
I don™t know what it was, once 
an hour, or whatever, he would come out 
and he would just come up behind me and 
stroke my hair, I had rather long hair. I mean
, not very  long, but you 
know, sort of up to 
the middle of my  back, and stroke my  hair a
nd ask me how I was doing, look down  to see 
-- make sure I was doing so mething serious. So
, I was always aware of his presence. And 
you know, it™s funny, people sa
y that when  you grow up with parents who argue, that it™s 
very troublesome, and I only ha
d one parent, but I had this 
brother. And, as I mentioned 
on th e videotape, very  often my  brother woul
d say one thing and my  mo ther would say a 
different thing. Bu t it never troubled me, be
cause I had somehow, at some very early 
stag e, mad e  u p  my  mind  th at my  mo th er was 
very emotional and that what she said came 
out of, sort of an emotional 
rationale, whereas what my br
other said made a lot mo re 
sense and came out of the gray matter center. 
And so, I was rarely 
troubled by this, 
because it was totally obvious that
 -- that almost all the time, 
it was better to do what my 
brother said.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

Q: So what was you relationship th en like w
ith -- with your -- with
 your mother? How -- 
How -- How -- I mean , apart from -- from that ev
en, I mean what -- what -- how did you -
- how do you lo ok back on it now, and -- 
and what -- what do you recall about it that 
stands out now? 
A: Well, I talked about this 
on the -- on the video interv iew, 
but my  sense of my mo ther 
has changed in the last 10 years. First of a
ll, I had a very  good relationship -- a pretty 
good relationship with my
 mother for most of my growing up years, because first of all, 

my  mo ther went to the factory every day 
and I was left alone. So I had a lot of 
responsib ility and my mother trusted me. And al
so, my mother did not
 indulge in certain 
things. For example, not terribly long after 
I came on -- I must have been like in first 

grade, there was all this buzz around th e block 
with th e kids, about where do babies come 

from, you know. And my  mo ther -- I don™t th
ink my  mo th er really knew a lot ab out 
where babies come fro m. My 
mother told me what she th
ought was the truth, babies 
come out of your stomach. Well, babies do no
t come out of your stomach, they come out 
of your uterus, but an yway, I mean, you kn
ow, she didn™t have the anatomy quite right, 
but -- but it -- or maybe that was just, you kno
w, the way people talk
ed about things in 
those days, but -- but she -- you know, I aske
d one day, ﬁWhere do babies come from?ﬂ 

And she just sat down and told  me, you kno
w, about the birds and the bees and th e 
flowers, and -- in a -- as straightforward 
a manner as she knew. So, I went out on th e 
street to play with my -- 
the little k ids and ultimately this
 conversation arose about where 
do babies come from and th is one kid told  me 
that babies are brought by the stork. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
55 
 
 
 
looked at this kid and I said, ﬁBabies are not brought by the stork.ﬂ And I repeated this 
whole lesson that my  mo ther had sai -- you know. So, so me of the parents were very 
distressed with either me or my  mo ther, or both. 
Q: How old were you then? 

A: Maybe about eight or nine. That -- Th
at I was going around sp
illing the beans about 
where babies really came from, when they  were telling their kids these unbelievably 
ridiculous stories. So I really appreciated th
at my mother was honest with me, as far as 
she, you know, she could be, a
nd -- and I could talk to her a
bout things, and she talked to 
me about things and we -- we kind of -- we did all right togeth er. You know, she -- When 

I had to memorize poems, you know, sh -- even though she was exhausted after coming 
home from work , and then doing all the ho
usework, cause my  brother and I did 
appallingly little, my brother less than I, but she would sit in bed and listen to me recite, 

you know, Gunga Din or something, ti -- until 
I had it memo rized, and -- and I would test 
her. She had a book about how 
to learn English and I would 
test her about, you know, 
this is cherry pie, and all these funny th in
gs. So she -- she was nice with me about, you 
know, helping me study and so far as she 
could, and -- and so on. The first friction 
between my  mo ther and me, ha
pp en ed  wh en  I w a s 
about 11, and the other -- there was 
another little girl that -- on my floor in 
the apartment house who was a year older. She 
turned  12, and she started dating, and my  moth
er got very nerv ous. 
My mother -- Well, I 
-- I don™t know. My  mo ther had an  argument th
roughout the rest of our lives, wh ich in 
retrospect is the mo st stupid, ridiculous ar
gument, especially by 19
90 standards, but in

college, the last year of college, I was friends
, pals, with another woman in the chemistr -
- who was a chemistry  major, and we™re still fri
ends, I mean, wa -- we still talk to each 
other, and I got her a job, as a ma tter of fact
, where I used to work
. This woman went off 
to Tanglewo od with  the guy who she s
ubsequently married. And my  mo ther was 
absolutely horrified th
at -- that this woman went off to
 Tanglewood and stayed  overn ight 
in some barn -- I -- they slep
t in some barn. And I was very
 naïve. I was -- I w as very 
naïve, em-emotionally. So -- So this argum
ent came up. My mo ther said, ﬁHm, ﬂ you 
know, ﬁwhat kind of a girl is this, going off to
, you know, stay in a 
barn overnight with  
this guy?ﬂ And I said, ﬁMa, I™m
 sure nothing happen
ed.ﬂ Now, in retros
pect, when I look 
back, I think why the hell was I so  sure th
at nothing happened , an
d who the hell cares? 
But, I think the reason I was so sure that 
nothing happened was, I 
rememb er this young 
woman once coming to me in 
the chemistry lab and telling 
me -- we were discussing -- 
tampons had just come out. We were discu
ssing whether it was all right to use tampons 
or not. And this woman said to me, ﬁWell, 
I can™t use tampons because what if my  hymen 
broke and you know, wh at would this guy say,
 if we get married and I™m not a virgin?ﬂ 
And, so I think that™s what made me so su
re that probably nothing happened. So anyway, 
so this conversation, about did something 
happen or did not something happen in the 
barn, my mother discussed un
til my mother got Alzheimer™s
 disease. I mean, it would 
come up once every year or two and my  mo th er
 would say, ﬁThat was disgusting that she 
spent the night in the barn.ﬂ And -- And I wo
uld say, ﬁMother, nothing happen ed in the 
barn.ﬂ You know, I mean, it wa
s j u st, you know, just so --

Q: Continue to -- 
A: My mother was extremely proud of the fa
ct that no man, other than my  father, had 
ever touched her. Wh en  my  mo ther was 80 a
nd we had moved her up 
here and she went 
to a -- a -- I don™t know, senior citizen club me
etings in Brookline, one day, it was raining 
very hard, and we came to pick 
her up to take her out to di
nner or something, and she had 
walked back , and she just casually mentione
d, she said there was this guy who had 
offered her a ride home, and I said, ﬁWell,ﬂ 
you know, ﬁwhy didn™t you take th e ride? It 
was raining.ﬂ She said -- I mean
, she just lifted her shoulders 
in that, you know, in that 
special, proud, European wo man sort of way.
 I mean, y-you just don™t see American 
women doing th ings like -- and she said, ﬁWho do
 you think I am? Would I get into a car 

with a strange man?ﬂ And here she was, 80,
 you know? And -- But I mean -- But I grew 
up that way. I mean, I -- Even 
when I -- I never dated in college. I think I -- I actually did, 

maybe on three occasions, go someplace with
 a guy. And they were -- they were 
generally very -- I mean, do you
 want to hear about this? 
Q: Sure. 

A: They were very strange events. I mean, I th
ink the first time was, my father went to 
medical school with a woman, who was the mo
ther of two sons, and I always say that I 
was friends with Bob Silber since four years 
before I was born, because our parents were 
friends. And so -- so those two parents were 
doctors. That g -- That guy just died. That 
guy died in Novemb er, Bob Silber, he was 
a hematologist. But anyway, I mean I -- you 
know, I™ve known him forever, an
d so we were always friends
 and he would -- he -- he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
58 
 
 
 
was older, I mean, he was four years older than
 I was, and he would 
take me places like 
Lewison Stadium, to the concerts and -- and th
ings. And so one day he said, ﬁI have -- I 
have this friend, and he™s 
-- he™s going to  this,ﬂ -- I don™t know, was some dance where 
you had to dress up. ﬁI want you to go 
with him.ﬂ You know, ﬁNothing will happen, 
everything™s going to be all right, I want you to
 go.ﬂ So  against great protest, I went and I 
went and I bought a -- sort of a dress that 
I actually remember. And it was a very -- I had 
a really unpleasant evening. I mean this -- I 
--  This guy didn™t know 
how to dance, I had 
never danced with anybody else before. I dan
ced a lot by my self, but I hadn™t ev er danced  
with anybody, ex cept my  mo ther and my  brot
her before. I was just really uncomfortable 
in this situation. This guy 
didn™t know how to carry on a 
conversation. I was -- So okay, 
so the next time, I think I -- we
ll, then I went to work at 
Brookhaven. Ther
e was a special 
program and you could apply fo r it and I -- I got
 in to go to Brookh
aven for two summers 
and work  at Brookhaven  National Lab. And 
I met a guy there, who actually is also a 
docto r now, down I think, maybe in Florid
a, whose name was Norman Bauman, and he 
and I would talk a lot and he -- I mean, I thi
nk I actually -- I might have actually even 
kissed him or something. I don™t know, but he 
-- he talked to me a lot about why was I so, 
you know afraid of getting close to s -- to so
me guy ra -- so we had a lot of interesting 
conversations, and -- and I felt sort of friendly 
with him for awhile. Bu
t I think -- I think -
- And I always had a fo nd spot in my  heart fo
r him, but I think it was more -- n o t so much 
because of things that he ta
lked to me about -- you know th
e -- that sort of dating game, 
but more because everybody I knew, practically
, hated their mothers, and you know, sort 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
59 
 
 
 
of -- maybe it™s still a popular thing to hate
 your mother, but Norm
an Bauman said, ﬁI 
really respect my parents and I really like my
 mother.ﬂ And he -- And I mean this -- that 
seemed very trivial in retrospect, but he said
, ﬁOne of the things I really like about my 
mother is that she never comes down to see me or my father with
out looking nice. She 
always comb s her hair, she always has a nice ba
throbe on. She always is respectful i-in 
that way.ﬂ And I thought, ﬁWow, this guy is
 really different from anybody I™ve ever 
met.ﬂ So that was my -- that was sort of lik
e a first awakening. And th en, in my  senior 
year -- the first year in college, I met a 
woman with whom I™m 
still friends, although 
we™ve had our ups and downs, but we™re still 
friends. And we got to be like best friends 
and we were best friends for four years. I 
mean, we spent practically all our spare time 
together. And -- But there was a -- there wa
s a really big upheaval. Her mo ther was 
constantly saying th ings like,
 ﬁBarbara, you can™t marry Liane, wh at are you spending so  
much time with Liane?ﬂ And I th
ought that was really like a horrible thing to say. You 
know, I mean, she was always wanting her da
ughter to go out on dates. And so her 
daughter did go out to tea da
nces, and you know, all these 
things that happened at the 
college. I n -- I never went to any of those. 
I mean I -- you know, and I used to -- I used 
to -- when I heard about the tea dances, I used
 to call them the slave market. M aybe other 
people called it that, also, you know, was th
e guys stood on one si
de, the women stood on 
the other side and I really hated that, 
I would never go to anything like that 
[indecipherable]. And -- But anyway, the last 
year in college, she met this guy and I don™t 
know how it happened, but she went and had 
coffee with him and I was supposed to meet 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
60 
 
 
 
her and so  I met him.  And she called me up 
and sh e said, ﬁHe would like to go out with 
you,ﬂ you know. ﬁWould you consider going out
 with him?ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell, I -- No, I 
don™t think so.ﬂ And she 
kind of talked me into it. So -- So
 I went to the movies with this 
guy, tall, thin guy. You mu st be
 laughing at all of this. This
 -- This guy -- So we went to 
the movies and then  he took me home, which 
was, I think the first time I™d ever been 
taken home. I mean I -- I used to come 
home alone in New Yo rk from the subway, you 
know, at two o™clock in the mo rning, never 
bothered me. My mother was always worried, 
but -- so he took me home and we got to 
my apartment door, and I was ready to say 
goodnight and he said, 
ﬁCould I come in for a little while?ﬂ 
Well, I didn™t really want him 
to come in, but I felt it was ve
ry impolite, so I -- I let him co
me in and so he sat down on 
the couch in the living room, and I sat down on 
a chair on the other side of the room. And 
n -- the bedroom adjoin ed the living room with a -- glass doors, which might have had 

some curtains on them, and th
ey  were not closed, and my  mo
ther was sleeping in this -- 
in this next room. And he said, ﬁWell, why 
don™t you come here and sit next to me and 
get a little cozy?ﬂ And I said, ﬁI don™t want to
 come and sit there and get a little cozy.ﬂ 
And then  he came and sat down next to me, where I was sitting. 
Q: On th e other side of the couch. 
A: Right. And do you -- you won™t believe 
-- do you know wh at I di
d? I went and woke 
my  mo ther up to  come and get 
this guy out of the house.  
Q: He mu st have been  
horrified. The poor guy. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
61 
 
 
 
A: And I -- I met him on campus afterwards, a
nd he said hello and I st -- do you know 
what I said to -- I said, ﬁYou
 are an animal.ﬂ I said, ﬁY
ou behaved appallin
gly the other 
night and I don™t ever want to see you agai
n.ﬂ So, I mean, looking 
now at you know, the 
current generations and so on, it™s -- I mean, this
 is really funny, but -- but in those days, I 
mean, you know, my  mo ther was so puritanical.
 And -- But it wasn™t just my mother, it™s 
just that she was more  so, but
 I remembered this -- th -- my
 good friend Barbara, th-the 
one who got me into this date, I remember 
one time -- I don™t know 
-- I bought a package 
of sanitary napkins or somethi
ng, and you know, in those days
 it wasn™t displayed, and so 
they would wrap it up in a br
 -- unmarked brown paper bag 
for you. And so we were in 
the subway, and Barbara said, ﬁW hat™s in the bag?ﬂ And I said
 in a whisper, I said, ﬁIt™s 
sanitary napkins.ﬂ And she got so angry with
 me because she thought I said that too 
loudly. So, I mean, you know, 
you have to -- you have to 
understand wh at I™m telling you 
in the context of those times
. So, anyway -- So then, I th
ink th ere was a very ma jor 
change that came. I really re
vered people wh o were very e
ducated and who did important 
things in their field. So, there were a c
ouple of things. I took 
physics from a guy named 
Al Predell, was the physics teacher™s name
, and everybody had a crush on this guy, 
probably except me, and -- but 
I kind of liked him, also. 
And he had a car and I was 
dying to learn how to drive. I mean, I just,mm, that was like uppermost in my mind. And 

this guy actually let me drive. I -- I got a lear
ner™s permit or whatev
er, and this guy -- you 
know, I don™t rememb er exactly, I -- I think 
my chemistry teacher, a woman, who just 
died at age 100, Dr. Stecker, for my gradua
tion bought me driving 
lesson -- three driving 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
62 
 
 
 
lessons, or something like that. And this guy 
Al Predell, let me take a couple of little 
short rides in his car, within the parking area
. But he was an avid 
tennis player, and he 
played tennis with a professor who was at 
-- probably at Columb ia
 at the time, whose 
name was Jack Steinberger, who™s now in Switz
erland if he™s still al
ive, which I have no 
reason to believe that he isn™t. Jack Steinb
erger won a Nobel Prize many years later, but 
Jack Steinberger had come, I think from Germ
any, and had a reputation for being a very  
brilliant nuclear physicist. So, I would sit on
 the tennis courts at Barnard sometimes, 
watching Al Predell play tennis with Jack St
einberg er. And th en the second year, I was at 
Brookhaven, Jack Steinberger would occasiona
lly turn up to use,
 I don™t know th e 
Cosmotron or something. And -- And I was a r
eal Jack Steinberger watcher, because I -- I 
-- you know, I had been told th
is is a great man. And one night Jack Steinberger asked me 
if I wanted to go for a ride, and I went for 
a ride with him and he started to make some 
advances. You know, I mean, he was old eno
ugh to be my  father -- well, I don™t know, 
maybe not quite. And I got very  angr
y with him and I said, ﬁI™m s -- 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This -- Okay, this is a 
continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Liane Rei
f-Lehrer. This is tape number three, side A. 
A: So -- So I gave Jack Steinberger this ta
lking to , about you know, ﬁYou™re supposed to 
be a brilliant physicist, how could you act 
this way?ﬂ You know, 
and I™m only telling you 
about this because I think that moment was a 
major turning point in 
my life, because Jack 
Steinberger looked at me in 
the eye, and he said, ﬁYou kn
ow, just because I™m a clever 
physicist, doesn™t have anythi
ng whatsoever to do
 with the rest of my personality, and 
why are you trying to cubby-hole me like this?ﬂ And he gave me this long -- I mean, it 
was almost like an oration, about that I wa
s doing something that didn™t make sense. I 
was trying to f -- to -- just because he did this
 one thing that I admired, I was trying to 
pan onto that, all sorts of attr
ibutes about who he was. So
 anyway , he gave me this 
speech, turned around, drove me
 back to my dorm and -- and 
that was -- that w as that. 
And I -- Jack Steinberger appeared once, ma
ny years later, when I 
was with my husband 
in Cambridge, at a little snack bar, and I -- 
politely we -- we chatte
d. And then we never 
had any contact until he won the Nobel Prize, and when he won the Nobel Prize, I knew 
wa -- I somehow periodically knew where he 
was. I wrote him a letter of congratulations 
and also -- and there was a little bit of corres
pondence back an
d forth, in which I -- I sort 
of partly apologized for, you know, being a r
eally naïve kid, or -- or something. But -- 
But I have to tell you that inside my inner se
lf -- Jack Steinberger, after -- at some point, 
married some woman he had known fo r four 
days and had either 
one or two kids, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
64 
 
 
 
then got divorced. And -- And th
at doesn™t -- you know, to th
is day, I mean, ev en though 
my  brother is in his third marriage, and -- 
and lots of peop -- I 
mean 90 percent of -- 
everybody seems to be divor
ced, remarried, you know, married
 fiv e times, an d so on and 
so forth. When I thi
nk about Jack Steinberger, I have so
me very positive feelin gs about -- 
about this very brilliant man who played tenn
is, but underneath that, there™s a guy who -- 
you know, who did something th
at was irresponsible. I mean, what [indecipherable] you 
get married  after four days? I mean, what ki
nd of stupid thing is that? But -- And -- But I 
think -- But I think I have Jack Steinberg er to th
ank, in a way, for -- for the fact that I got 
married, because he -- he did s -- he snappe
d something in my wa
y of thinking, that 
allowed me to view things 
differently from the way I had 
ever viewed them before.  

Q: Okay. Let me just -- I want to -- I want 
to continue the -- the ch
ronology, but before I 
forget I want to go back to 
a couple things. Just -- More -- 
More back in 
your childhood, I 
-- I wanted to ask you about wh ether your -- you or your mo ther, or your -- your brother, 
in the years that you first arrived, in ™41 th
rough ™45, especially, wa-was there an attempt 
to k -- sort of keep up
 on what was happening, either thro
ugh just reading the papers, or -- 
or through some -- some ot
her, you know, wo rd of mouth 
or corresp ondence? Did y -- 
Were you aw are of what was going 
on there, and was your family? 
A: Yeah. Well, first of all, 
my  mo th er was an  av id  n ewsp a
per reader, so when we first 
came, she used to read th -- 
a German paper called The Alfbo,
 which may still exist. And 
then she -- then she -- wh
en  she could read English, she wo
uld read that plus the daily -- I 
think The Post, she used to read and 
sometimes The New York Times. I -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
65 
 
 
 
Q: Was it A-A-Alfbo it was called? 
A: Alfbo. 
Q: And was that a German -- 
A: A German -- 

Q: -- controlled? 

A: No, no, no, it™s a German -- 
Q: [indecipherable] this was a German language -- 
A: -- no, it™s published here, but
 a German language newspaper. 
Q: Uh-huh. Mm-hm. 
A: So sh e was very interested in keeping up 
with the news. She also
 was very a -- I mean, 
all sh -- you know, we left everybody behind 
in -- in Europe. I mean, her parents and -- 
were in Poland. Her sister and her sister™s
 husband and ch ildren, 
her brother and -- you 
know, and all my fath er™s relatives were -- were there, except for these two -- My Aunt 

Lena Klinghoffer and -- and my -- my fath
er™s brother, my Uncle Jack, and -- who 
spelled his name with an extra f, R-e-i-f-f, fo
r some bizarre reason. So she was always 
trying to  make contact, and she -- she sent 
Care packages to certain people. You know 
that place called Care, and they  send packag
es? I don™t remember w ho, but she often -- 
when she could afford it, late
r on, she would send Care pack
ages to certain people. I™m 
trying to  find out what happened  to different
 people, th -- I thi
nk there was -- you know 
that -- telep h oning was not easy, the way it is 
now, and we didn™t -- when we first moved 
into our apartment in Brooklyn
, we didn™t have a telephone 
for a long time, and then it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
66 
 
 
 
was, you know, it was very special, having this telephone and -- 
but you didn™t telephone 
lightly. I mean, you know, wh ere you had, I 
don™t know, 20 telephone calls a month in  -- 
in whatever the minimum charge
 was, but -- so she did try 
very hard. I was -- I think I 
was fairly unattached from that whole thing,
 but -- but what happened is, as the years 
went by in New Yo rk, different people would 
appear. Like this -- this guy I told I you 
was friends with since four years before I wa
s born, I mean s -- at some time, and I don™t 
remember exactly when, his fa
mi ly, who had gone to Santa Domingo, appeared  in New 
York . And so, all of a sudden
, there was this new old frie
ndship that picked up and so 
they would come to visit us, we would go 
to visit them. Doctor Kleinfeld, the -- the 
lawyer, we went to visit his family quite often.
 I mentioned that in the other interview, he 
was the one who help ed us pack  the van. An
d then he died, I don™t remember o f what, 
and -- but his -- his second wife, who is the 
one we -- we knew, liv
ed in New York , we 
visited her a long time. I pretty much lost trac
k. They -- They  had three children. One, the 
oldest one was from a first 
marriage, he went to Israel an d I -- I think I once 
corresponded with him. The dau
ghter I once corresponded with, 
but I™ve lost track of her. 
The son is a math professor, where? Maybe 
in Iowa, or something, and I -- I have 
occasionally corresponded with 
him, but the -- the s -- th at son married a woman that my 
brother kind of liked  also, and -- and I do
n™t mean romantically  -- well, maybe even 
romantically, but anyway, that woman, who s
till goes by the name of Ruth Kleinfeld, a -- 
i -- now lives in Hawaii, she™s a professor -- 
retired professor of biology, and we have 
suddenly  started e-mailing back  and fo rth 
a -- a fair amount. Sh  -- Bu t she and Irwin 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
67 
 
 
 
Kleinfeld got divorced after quite a lot of 
years. They didn™t have any ch ildren. Irwin 
Kleinfeld remarried, she remarried, her husba
nd™s now very sick. So
 -- So these people 
would keep, you know, cropping up
 from -- from the 
old country.  
Q: Did -- Were you aware of a -- wh -- th -- I 
mean, a-as a child, I -- I -- I know that there 
was this -- this envelope that arrived one day,
 and I want to ask you 
about that, but before 
that happened -- 
A: The blue letter, yeah. 
Q: The blue letter. Before that arrived, were
 you aw are that -- did you have any sense, or 
did your mo ther or 
brother have any sense of -- of this -- 
A: Oh, I think my  brother had a very real sens
e. Whenever I discuss, for example, the trip 
on th e San Louis with my  brothe
r, he always says he doesn™t -- he could not understand, 
even though he was so young, he could not 
understand why, on th
e voyage going to  the 
U.S., before the boat was turned
 around, why were all these 
people dancing and doing all 
these jovial things, when they
 had just left th eir families 
behind, knowing they probably 
would never see them again, th
ey had lost family me mb ers. And he said, ﬁAnd all of a 

sudden, they ™re on th is ship, making like it™s 
a party.ﬂ And he just -- I mean, you know, 
by th e way -- 

Q: A-A-And he knew -- he knew that at the time? 

A: Yes, he -- 

Q: Tell me what you™re showing us there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

A: This is an article that came out in the May 20
th
 Boston Globe. It™s
 funny when I -- 
when I read it first, I though
t it said voyage through the ye
ars and I looked  again and it 
says voyage through the tears. And so , I was one of the three people interviewed for this 
article. This picture -- This large picture in this
 article, i-in -- this is in the Living section 
of the Bo ston Globe -- 

Q: May 20
th
.  
A: I actually fe -- yeah, May 20
th
, 1999. I actually found this
 picture at the 1989 reunion 
in Florid a. There was -- I think it was a c
ouple named the Aaron™s, A-A-r-o-n , and you 
know, people brought things to
 the reunion, and th is couple
 brought this photo album, 
and I couldn™t believe what I saw, but I op
ened their photo album and th ere was this 
picture and here this -- this is
 me and th is is my brother. 

Q: Hm, he was very well dressed there, for a 
-- let™s see, in 1939, 
he would have been 
what -- he must -- 
A: At 12. 
Q: 12 years old, okay . 

A: Now, notice them -- th-th-the most charact
eristic thing is, you see there are two pens 
in his pocket? There are always at least two pe
ns and pencils in my  brother™s pockets, so -
- 

Q: To this day. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
69 
 
 
 
A: To this day, always. So -- A-And th is, th
is is the guy who -- who I think started the -- 
the reunion thing going, and this
 is a picture of Liesel Loeb, whose father was the head of 
the passenger committee on the San Louis.  
Q: Well, you know I -- I wanted to ask you ab
out this whole -- I mean, your brother had 
this sense at the time, that this was 
inappropriate that they were dancing. 
A: Look at the looks on 
-- look at that look.  
Q: It™s just like disgusted. 

A: Look -- Look at every other child here. 
Every other child here, except for maybe this 
little baby and th is little baby. Every other child 
here is smiling, right, or -- or you know, 
or something, my  brother looks like a -- a grandfather. [p hone ringing] 

Q: So you™re saying again, everybody looks 
like they™re smiling, except for -- except for 
your brother. 

A: Right. And he w -- he was just
 this very serious kid. So -- 
Q: And yet, he™s responding to  
the reality of the situation mo
re than some of the other 
people on the ship. 

A: Abso lutely. I mean -- 
Q: But -- And so  he -- Did he -- I mean, to wh
at degree did he or 
any of you know what 
was going on? 
A: I think my  brother was extremely aware. I 
don™t think I was terribly aware, I just knew 
that bad things were happening, but I don™
t think -- I don™t think I -- you know, I don™t 
think I sort of was into form
ulating thoughts like, how come
 I don™t have grandparents, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
70 
 
 
 
-- I mean, maybe I thought that
, cause there were grandparen
ts in the house, but I -- it 
didn™t -- I don™t think it really sank in. Th-T he 
first -- The loss of my  father, that sank in, 
because I heard about that all the time, you kn
ow, once a year my mother lit candles. My 
mother wore black for years and years and ye
ars. She often reminisced about my father. 
One of the things that I™m hopi
ng to find one day is, unti -- I -- 
I really -- I -- in -- in a lot 
of ways, I ten -- I guess I grew up like a boy,
 and so th ere was sort of a no-no. You 
weren™t supposed to cry. I -- 
And my  mo ther would start ta
lking about these things and 
she would -- she would dissolve in tears and I 
-- I couldn™t cope with seeing her that way 
and I couldn™t -- I just couldn™t deal with 
that whole scene and so I would -- I would 
always turn her off, which was really terribl
e, I mean in retrospect. And now I™m -- I™m 
sorry, and actually, one day, long after I wa
s married and had kids, my  mo ther was up 
here and she started talking about -- and I 
-- I was trying to  stop her and ma -- and my  
husband -- 
Q: She started talking about what? 
A: The past. You know, what happened, my father, etcetera. I -- And I just could never 

cope with that, so -- so I just 
-- I think I just kind of walked 
out of the room or something, 
and -- and my  husband took a tape recorder 
and said okay -- we -- we both called her -- 
well, my  husband called her grandma, I think,
 after the kids were born. And he took a 
tape recorder and he had her record a whole ta
pe about her feelings, an -- and I cannot fi -
- that tape has got to be some
where in this house, and I cannot find it. Because, of course, 
now I™m dying to know wh at we
re her thoughts and I am extr
emely angry with my self for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
71 
 
 
 
not asking her all sorts of questions that I want
 to know about, and -- but I just could not 
emotionally cope with listening to her, not
 -- not only because the information was 
hurtful, but because I think I 
could not cope with watchingher dissolve in tears. And 
guess wh at? At some stage -- and I don™t kn
ow wh en it started to happen, I started 
dissolving in tears, ev -- you know, for certa
in things and I -- I can™t even define, but 
when  people talk about certain things -- certain 
kinds of things that 
happen, or talk about 
certain things related to my mother or my fath
er, or -- I -- I just involuntarily start crying 
-- or sometimes if the kids say something. A
nd that is so horrible, because I remember 
what it -- an awful feeling it 
was when  my  mo ther cried. So I™m always apologizing to 
the kids, you know, I™m sorry, th
is is totally involuntary. 
Q: But -- 
A: I don™t mean to be doing th is. 

Q: A-And so  it -- wa -- it™s partly just -- wh
at you learned was that you don™t do this. Do 
yo -- Do you -- Do you know wh
y that you felt that that wa
s inappropriate? That -- That, 
you know, you don™t -- 
y-y-y -- you got to be tough, 
you got to move on, you know, 
given wh at you had gone
 through, was it -- 
A: Well, I s -- I certainly knew that you had 
to be tough and you ha
d to move on. I mean, 
I think that was a -- I think that was a less
on I learned pretty early. But why I couldn™t 

listen to her, you know, spilling out what was 
hurting her and so on, I think it™s because it 
just made me feel so awful to see her cry an
d to see her be in that kind of pain. And I -- 
And I did a very non-adult thing, I mean I -- th
e adult thing would have been to just sit 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
72 
 
 
 
and listen and say so mething he
lpful, and -- and my -- my -- 
my thing was to disappear. I 
wanted to  just get the hell out of there.  
Q: And -- And wh at sort of things now d 
-- like you saying sometimes you™ll just dissolve 
into tears yourself when  it™s triggered by 
something. What -- Wh
at -- Is it specific 
memories of this time, or other things that
 are traumatic in the 
world? What -- What 
kinds of things? 

A: Probably all of the above.
 I mean, like I™ve been very g
ood this morning, but -- but 
you could say something, or I could say 
something and all of a sudden, I just 
decomp en sate, as I call it. Some
times it -- just in recent 
weeks, listening wh en I -- you 
know, I can listen and I can be very  stern a
nd all there to the news every night about 
Yugoslavia, but sometimes, when I hear or see a picture of the refugees mar-marching 
down  the road, and an old lady in a wheelb
arrow or something, I just -- you know, tears 
come to my eyes and I just -- 
Q: Taps real deep, huh? 
A: Yes. As a matter of fact, as I was sa
ying to somebody the othe
r day, I think this 
Koso vo thing has probably come closer to getti
ng to the real inside of me than anything 
that™s happened in the interv
ening times. I mean, 
every time there is 
anything about war, 
or violence or anything like that, that absolu
tely turns my stomach. 
I mean, I -- I know 
this is a stupid, naïv e thing to say, but I 
ha -- I, to this day, 
I do not understand how 
people can call themselves civ
ilized and -- and -- and fight wars. I mean, it™s -- th -- the 
concep t seems so ridiculous that, you know
, you shoot me and I™ll shoot at you and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
73 
 
 
 
whoever gets the mo st guys do
wn , gets to do what they  want
. And in  the meantime -- you 
know, I wrote a po -- I -- I like to write poetry sometimes, I haven™t done it for a long 
time, but I used to do it mo re. I wrote a poe
m after the Yom Kippur War, in which I tried 
to express that when  you have 
a ch ild, you know, the nine months of gestation is not a big 
deal, but it™s the next 21 years, when you esse
ntially devote the most  incredibly -- I mean, 
if you™re a reasonable parent at least, the mo
st incredible amount of emotional energy, to  
try to make this fledgling fly. 
It is -- It™s -- I mean, it™s just 
an -- it™s the hardest thing that 
I™ve ever, ever done in my life. A nd the th
ought that somebody can say, ﬁWell, hey so 
today we™re going to have a war, and I™ll shoot
 a few of your kids, and you™ll shoot a few 
of my  kids, and then  they™ll be gone.ﬂ That is
 so obscene a thought to me, that I -- I mean, 
I literally, I don™t even have words to expr
ess what I feel abou
t that. Do you have 
children, by the way? 
Q: No. 
A: No. I don™t know. 
Q: I have lots of nieces and 
nephews and I can iden
tify with what you™re saying, to some 

degree. 
A: I mean, I just, you know, it 
just -- for somebody, I mean, 
or even , you know, even a 
spouse or a parent or something, but I think it
™s worst with a child, bu
t to -- to actually s -
- you know, a -- a lot of funny th ings have 
happened in my life. 
About, I don™t know, 
maybe 13 years ago, I-I -- I generally, for the 
last 15 or so years, I™ve -- go out -- go out 
running in th e mo rning, and I used to have a route along th e highway, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
74 
 
 
 
Q: It™s so pretty here, by the way. 
A: Yeah, it is, yeah. 
Q: Just a beautiful piece of land. 
A: I went out and I was running on Pleasant St
reet, which is a fairly well traveled street, 
and that morning, I saw a cat th
at looked virtually 
exactly like this black cat, which is our 
daughter™s cat, and it had even th
at same little kink at the e
nd of the tail, and it had been 
run over. I saw that cat, and I started to -- 
I mean, it was more than weeping, it was 
almost screaming and I came 
running home here, and I wa
s -- I think my daughter was 
actually here, and I -- I just came u p  and I 
sat on th e bed next to my  husband and I -- I 
was just literally fallin g apart, I was 
just weeping and weeping and weeping, 

uncontrollably. And then the cat, our cat, came 
back into the house. So my husb and and I 

-- so I calmed down, my husb
and and I went and buried th
is other cat, but something 
happened  to  me that day, and I don™t know wh
at it was, but I™ve always thought to myself 
that no matter how horrible -- and I -- this may 
not be true, but -- but the thought in my 

head is that -- that I would never, ever be th
at upset again, no matter what happened. That 
-- That I would -- That I would just never, ever crack up like that again. 
Q: What -- What -- Wh a -- Where did that r
each? What -- How did it reach you like that? 
I mean, what was it pulli
ng it back onto you? 
A: I don™t know, I don™t know. You know, if I had my  life to live over again and if I 
could afford  it this time, which I couldn™t ha
ve the last time around, I think it would be 
really interesting t-to go -- ha
ve psychotherapy, a-an
d see if they could, you know, drag 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
75 
 
 
 
anything out of me. But again, I mean, that
 was -- you know, that was just some real 
change, I mean, like the thing th
at happened with 
Jack Steinberger, which allowed me to 
get on with -- I don™t -- you know, some other 
level of living. Bu t -- But wh en th e cat -- 
When I found that dead cat that day, I -- I ju
st -- I mean, I went be
rserk in a way that I 
don™t think I™ve ever gone be
rserk before. And -- And something just snapped and I -- 
and since then -- I mean, you k
now, people that I know have
 died and bad th ings have 
happened  and -- but I -- I don™t think I have ev er
 again been at that 
incredible wh atever it 
was. And I -- I have a funny feeling that I neve
r will be again. I -- I mean that -- that I -- 
that something happened
 to me that day. 

Q: But it wasn™t just about a cat, it seems. 
A: Well, I -- I ca -- It couldn™t have been ju
st about the cat, because you know, I re -- we 
had a wonderful, wonderful Sibe
rian Husky dog, for about 12 
years, and I just absolutely 
adored  that dog and that dog -- one night 
my husband -- well, he
 was -- she was very 
arthritic and one day my husba
nd took her out for a walk a nd he let her off the leash, 
which he almo st never did, and she walked 
aw ay and never came back. And my  son and I 
sat and cried together, and -- you know, but itwasn™t -- it wasn™t that same thing. And 
when my mother died, that wa
s s -- that was horrible, but -- but it wasn™t that same -- 
whatever thing happened to me 
the day I found th at dead cat. 

Q: Yeah. You know, as you™re talking abou
t this, wh -- you know, where you started 

talking about looking at this picture, and yo
u™re talking about the 
war that™s going on now 
in -- in Yugoslavia and Serb
ia and Kosovo and -- and we™re
 looking at the picture of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
76 
 
 
 
these children, you™re talking about war a
nd ch ildren. And I was thinking, you know, 
when I was preparing for the interview and thinking about talking 
to you, you know, one 
question came to my  mind, and -- and I wo nder 
if it -- it forms your memo ry of this time, 
or even maybe your views, subsequently, of
 the world is, you know, being on the San 
Louis and -- and not having a place to get off, 
I mean, it™s such a ho
rrible and almost like 
my thological story, you know. And I was wonde
ring, you know, in yo
ur mind, in your 
heart, li -- did you have a sens
e or do you have sens
e now of wh at -- what kind of world 
is it, that doesn™t let 
people get off that ship? 
A: I don™t -- I don™t know th at I thought ab
out it at the time, but -- and my  brother 
certainly thought a lot about it,
 but I think about it a lot now, because -- and especially 
with the Kosovo situation. I mean, I ofte
n wonder about -- you know, I -- what kind -- 
this is really a funny worl
d, you know, we have border
s. And I™ve -- I™ve -- I™ve been 
asked to lecture about five times n o w in the fo
rmer Soviet Union, and 
this last trip, which 
was the first week of May, I -- I didn™t feel th is so much this time, 
but the other trips, I 
certainly felt -- actually, I was ve
ry apprehensive before this 
trip, I was very apprehensive 
before this trip, but then once I left, i-it wa
s -- it was okay, but the other trips, I don™t 
know, mo re funny th ings happened, and yo
u see police people with machine guns. You 
know, I mean, you see that some
times in -- in western Europe 
also, but I -- I really don™t 
do well with that, at all.  

Q: Checkpoints you mentioned.  
A: Yes, or guns. I really do not like guns. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
77 
 
 
 
Q: What is it -- What does it do? Make
 you nervous, does it make you angry? 
A: It makes me ner -- It makes me nervous 
and it also ma kes me angry. Guns can hurt 
people. An-A nd we were just having th is disc
ussion th e other night, guns can hurt people 
in a very impersonal way. Oh , I -- It was my
 son who was saying that, that, you know, if 
you -- I -- they were talking 
about gun control and I said, 
ﬁOh well, you know, big deal. 
So they take away the guns, 
they™ll do it some other way.ﬂ And my  son said, ﬁW ell, you 
know, it™s a little hard when you
 have to kind of actually 
go up and physically grab 
somebody,ﬂ he said. ﬁWith a gun, it™s very 
impersonal, you can stay far away, you can 
get a lot of people at once,ﬂ and so  on. I -- Th
e idea of -- of people hurting other people, 
even emotionally, but -- but certa
inly physically, is extremel
y abhorsen to me. I mean, it -
- We have come such a long way, you know. 
I look around me, we send somebody to th e 
moon, we have televisions, we
 have CD™s, now we have mi
ni CD™s, you know, we keep 
making progress. We do all these wonderful th
ings. And then we tu
rn around and kill 
each other. Does that make sense? I mean, 
th ere™s something bizarrely inappropriate 
about -- about that. And I guess -- I mean, pe
ople sometimes challenge me on -- on -- on 
that, but I guess -- I don™t know, I guess I value 
brain power a lot, and 
I don™t want to see 
anybody killed or -- or hurt or an ything, but 
-- but I have some funny feelings inside 
when somebody really 
worthwhile gets killed, and then 
there are all these people around 
who are costing society m
oney, and causing troub --

Q: Okay, this is a continuatio
n of a United States Holocaus
t Memorial Museum interview 
with Liane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number three, side B. 
A: If somebody -- some ridicul ous person goes out and kills
 off some wonderful person, 
who™s making fantastic contributions to soci
ety, etcetera, that -- I mean, I™m very 
democratic, but that makes me even more an
gry, because you know, like -- all right, if 
you don™t want to do anything
 constructive and you want to
 go to  some island and send 
all people who want to 
be on drugs, and not do anything 
constructive, and you want to go 
there and you want to fight 
each other all the time, you know
, go, be my guest, do it. Kill 
yourselves off, you know, do wh
atever you want. But just don™t bother the people who 
are trying to be constructive and who are using th eir brain power to make the world a 
better place to live in. I mean it 
-- it -- you know, if you take -- an-and of course, in a war 
-- in a war situation, what do 
you do? You take the -- the cr
eam of your population, you 
take the people who are, you know, 20 to 30. 
In the sciences, those -- that™s the -- that™s 
the place where, for example, in physics, 
that™s the time when  people make their 
contributions. So you take this -- this group of 
people at the absolute 
apex of their time to 
contribute and to -- to do wond
erful things and you -- you pop
 them off? I mean, i-it™s -- 
it™s not a good thing fo r me to talk about 
because I -- you know, I mean, there™s another 
part of me that says yeah, you know, I me
an, people are -- I mean, w hy do I expect 
people to be different from all the other 
animals? You know, you -- you watch channel 
two, or you watch the Nature 
channel and you know, this animal eats that next animal 
down, that™s a little smaller and a little slower 
and so on and so  forth.
 And after all, we™re 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
79 
 
 
 
just evolved from those. So why am I surp
rised, you know? But then  I said, but you 
know, but tions and ligers, and -- ta -- 
lions and tigers don™t invent, you know, 
Cosmotrons and airplanes and spaceships and so
 on and so  forth. So -- So we are a little 
different. Well, if we are a little different, 
why don™t we act as though we are a little bit 
more civilized than those othe
r species? But we don™t. Yo
u know, people get into bar 
room brawls, and -- and they get drunk an
d they waste their lives an d they -- 
Q: I think -- you know, picking up on this 
a little bit, to just as
k you just -- I mean, I 
guess I-I™m wondering whether the Saint Louis e
xperience is something that you feel has 
shaped you, that -- 
that sort of not being able to come
 to port. I mean, is that something 
that you™ve carried with you as a -- as a worl
d view, in a sense? In --
 In a -- In a sense of 
having only a certain  num
ber of, you know, in a se
nse of trust, perhaps? 
A: Well, first of all, that™s -- yeah, I™m not 
a very trusting person. I™m -- I guess, in some 
ways, I™m a very suspicious person. I mean, 
in some ways, I™m very
 trusting, but on th e 
whole, I™m not very trusting. I think the Sa
n Louis business had a very major effect on 
me, but not -- not in a direct, obvious way, but -- 
I mean, first of all, I sit here now, at my  
present age of almo st 65, and lo ok back  on
 it and think, you kn
ow, yeah, I mean, you 
know, this is a ca -- this is supposed to be 
a co untry, give me your tired, your poor, and 
here were 900  people who -- I mean, anybody
 who had any ounce of 
brain in  their head 
would have known what the proba
ble fate of these people were if they got sent back to 
Europe. You know --  So I keep asking myse
lf, I mean, what would it have hurt anybody 
to let these people in? And most people had vi
sas to the U.S. anyway
. They -- It was just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
80 
 
 
 
-- I mean, ours was like six months from comi
ng due. But then, on the other hand, I -- 
you know, my  rational self 
takes over and I say, ﬁWell, maybe they can™t do that, 
because, you know, what if everybody in the 
whole wide world want
ed to move to the 
U.S.? That wouldn™t work, so
 what do you do? And I don™t know the answer and I™m a 
very non-political animal. But I 
think the more important thin
g that shaped me, for better 
or wo rse, is that we did have
 to go back and we did go thro
ugh this experience in France, 
and co ming here, and I think those events, ve
ry, very much shaped 
a lot of my views. 
And my  brother always says, you know, we ar
e stronger because we survived  all those 
things, than we would 
have been if none of
 this had happened. 
Q: I-In what way do you think 
that they sh -- those later 
events shaped 
your views? I 
mean, we™ve been talking about 
a lot of that, but I mean, di 
-- does something really stand 
out in terms of -- of how th
at shaped your world view? 
A: I think -- Well, I think I owe my  brother 
something for this, but also, I think it taught 
me that, you know, people are people and they, 
unfortunately, speak different languages, 

which makes life interesting, 
but -- but more bellicose. Beca
use when you don™t speak the 
same language, you can™t even explain to
 the other person, us
ually, you know, how 
you™re feeling about something. So -- But I go
t to meet people in -- you know, a lot of 
different cities, a lot of different places. 
I got bounced around and I learned that, you 
know, wherever I went, there were some pe
ople who were wonderfu
l, and there were 
some people who were kind of just there, a
nd there were some people who were slightly 
on th e disgusting side. And I think the mo st 
important thing that I learned was to -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
81 
 
 
 
mean sh -- of course I generalize often, you
 know, in conversation, but I don™t really 
generalize in my -- in my own head. I don™t 
-- And  when I do, I -- 
every time, I will pull 
myself back. If I say, ﬁOh my God, those CP
A™s are so, you know, something or other, 
because I -- I give a lecture to a group of 
CPA™s once a year and th
ey seem so boring. 
And so I™ll say -- I™ll -- I mean a th ought lik
e that may cross my  mind and then  -- and 
then I always pull my self back and say, you 
know, not all CPA™s are that way and -- and -
- and everybody™s different and y
ou really have to meet each 
person and get to know th at 
person, an d not make a judgment, and -- and I™m not really making a judgment, I mean 
it™s just kind of a comment that -- so I think --
 I think -- I think th at whole scenario taught 
me to be resilient in a lot of ways, taught
 me to -- to be, I hope, fairly open-minded. 
Taught me to be reasonably lib
eral. I just learned a lot. I guess mostly taught me to be 

resilient. T aught me to be able to shift on a dime, often. You know, taught me to do what 

needs to be done and -- and try to get 
on with things as best as possible.  
Q: Y-You know you -- You mentioned befo re, just
 the -- the irony, the deep irony of -- of 
the life that you™ve lived and -- and -- and how 
-- how it was in -- in -- in an ironic sense, 
almo st made possible by these terribly traumatic events. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And you™ve also written as -- in  reading 
some -- some of what 
you™ve written, about 
the -- I can™t remember how you  put it, I guess, just to 
-- to be alive, by chance. 
A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
82 
 
 
 
Q: How much is -- does -- do you carry that w
ith you? I mean, just th
is -- this fa -- kind 
of like fate or -- or happenstance? 
A: Oh, that I carry a lot of. As a matter of fa
ct, that™s an -- that™s an almost horrible, 
haunting thing. First of all, 
I am extremely aware that not 
only I, but we™re all alive by 
chance, and I™m not talking abou
t the chance of having been
 conceived and born, but I™m 
talking about that every day, all sorts of horri
ble things happen, th at -- that very abruptly 

end people™s lives, and all you ha
ve to do is to happen to  be in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. You know, if you™re standing 
outside and you get hit by lightning in  the 
wrong way, that™s -- th at™s th
e end. That is always just 
one millimeter away from the top 
of my  head. I fought against my  mo ther bei
ng worried all the time, 
but I think I™m a very 
good mother, except -- or have 
been a very good mo
ther, except for one thing, and that is 
that I™ve always worked full time and I™ve alwa
ys been able to cope with this, but it 
actually sort of gets harder. I mean, I could be
 sitting at my desk at work and be writing a 

paper about you know, the induction of glutam
ine synthetase and all of a sudden, some 
horrible scenario will flash thro
ugh my head. All -- This has 
happened to me all through 
my  adult life. F-For just 
-- you know, for a nanosecond. 
Q: Like what? Can you talk about that? 
A: I -- I know what the -- what the pictures 
are, and I can almo st not mention them, but 
something awful happening to one of our ki
ds, or something happening to my  husband, 
or something happening to my
 brother. And -- And this sort
 of chill or shiver comes 
across my body, and th
en -- but I™m a reasonably controlled person, and so all my  life, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
83 
 
 
 
something like that happens and I -- I have th
e ability to push it out immediately , and say, 
ﬁI™m not going to think about that.ﬂ But, it gets -- it gets harder. I mean, I -- and so -- I 
mean, I try na -- I have tried not to -- 
to -- to do this thi
ng to my children. 
Q: To do what thing? 
A: This thing that my mother
 did about, you know -- I wa
s very good about this, you 
know, call me. Call me when yo
u get there, call me, call 
me, le t me  know, you know, 
etce -- two years after we finished graduate 
school, my  husband and I took a -- took a 
year off and took a trip around the world. I 
wrote my  mo ther every day. Now, she didn™t 
get those things every day, 
unfortunately, you know, she™d 
get nothing for a week and, 
you know -- and now when  I think back  on it, 
I think, ﬁOh my  God, what did I do to her? 
How could I have done that to her?ﬂ To -- To
 leave her worrying all the time, cause she 
must -- she was undoubtedly wo
rried all the time, and -- but
 I -- I didn™t understand in 
those days, what is she worrying about, you 
know? As a matter of fact, she would always 
be worried when I came home alone at night 
after dark and I thought, ﬁWhat the hell is 
she worrying ab out?ﬂ You know, ﬁIt™s fine. 
I™m just walking from the subway,ﬂ you 
know, and -- it wasn™t real -- it wasn™t un
til I was in college and I had an unpleasant 
incident with a guy following me, when  I was in
 college, that really  got me scared, that I 
realized for the first time, why my mother wa
s worried. But, I try no
t to worry 
about my 
children, and I have a lo t -- I always have a lo t 
of work to do and that
™s a very good thing 
for me, because I get very invo
lved in my work. Bu
t, there™s that voice that comes in. I 
mean, for example, I try not to make the kids call me, okay, very
 often. But now our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
84 
 
 
 
son™s been -- been sick and now 
I™m sort of more worried, so 
now I say, well just for this 
period, it™s all right for me to ask him to call.
 That was him calling to tell me th at he had 
arrived where he was going. Ou
r daughter right now is in Is
rael, and I ha -- I must say 
I™ve been very good
 for her being in Israel, fo r these 
few weeks, partly because I™m so 
worried about our son that it™s kind of a divers
ion for me. But then, a few days go by and 
if I haven™t heard from her, there are all these 
things that start. It
™s almost like a cash 
register tap e. What if s-such and such 
happened? You know, ma
ybe this happened, 
maybe that happened . And I just 
-- I mean, I just have to live 
with that, and I try as -- as 
hard as I can, to not -- to not 
make them aware of that any mo
re than is necessary, to not 
make that a burden to  them, the way it was 
a burden to  me, that my mo ther always 
worried about me. But you know, our daughter -- 
bo-both of our kids are -- are -- are very 
with it. And -- And our -- our daughter is a 
very clever young lady. And so one day she 
said something about this, and I 
said, ﬁWell, you know, I have 
tried very hard to not, you 
know, do to you what 
my  mo ther did to me.ﬂ And she looked at me and she said, ﬁMa, 
who do you think you™re kidding?ﬂ She said, 
ﬁYou don™t have to say anything and we 
know exactly what you™re thinking. We kn
ow exactly when you
™re worried, you don™t 
have to say one wo rd .ﬂ And -- And you know
, and they ™v e been very  good ab out it. I 
mean, I try very hard, wh
en  thin gs are norma l, I try to bite my  tongue and I try very hard , 
when  they  were living at home, to not say call me, you know, or something. So  

sometimes I™ve made an agreement, if you
™re not going to  be hom
e by one, would you 
give me a call? So that™s my exterior and th
at™s the way I want it to be for the kids. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
85 
 
 
 
behind th e scenes, hoo. First of all, I™m a very
 punctual person, in the Germanic way, you 
know. And my  brother, wuh, my  brother and th
is other German kid, when  they  were both 
at Columbia college, would meet each other 
on Saturdays at noon. 
This guy would pace 
the street d o wnstairs and at exactly noon, 
Meridian time, our bell would ring. And if I 
told my  brother I was meeting him at 12:06, a
nd I was one minute late, he would look at 

me very sternly and say, ﬁYou™re late.ﬂ So -- 
So I grew  up with th at, okay? So , you come 
on time. If -- And th is has happened many 
times, and my broth -- my  husband is 

wonderful with this, because he
 generally does not -- it takes a lot to start him worrying. 
So, one of our kids goes out, they
 say they™ll be home at abou
t one. So I™m fine, more or 
less, until one. At 1:05, somethi
ng starts happening in my body,
 that I can™t describe to 
you. By  1:10 it™s getting wo rse and by 1:15, I™m in bad shape. 

Q: In -- In what way? 
How are you in bad shape? 
A: I don™t know. It™s as though there are seve
n million ants crawling inside of me, or I -- I 
mean, I can™t -- I can™t even describe it, and 
then I start saying to my  husband, ﬁDo you 
think we should call?ﬂ And my  husband says, ﬁN
o, they™ll -- they™re 
fine.ﬂ And then I -- 
you know, so I wait another 15 mi
nutes and then this thing has -- 
Q: Your stomach™s churning, and --  

A: Su -- At the very end stag
es, my stomach starts churning, it™s just -- it™s like a total 
body discomfort. And then 
-- An d I get mo re and mo re anxious and -- and then  my  
husband starts listing all the reasons why th ey
™re late. And the funny thing is, I™m a very 
good learner, except for this, 
because 99 percent of the time,
 when they get home, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
86 
 
 
 
husband has hit on one of the reasons why th
ey™re  late. And it™s always some very 
legitimate thing. But I start to
 no longer -- after -- actually
, our kids are very good and 
they rarely are more th
an half an hour late without calli
ng. They really are wonderful. So 
it™s very rare that I get to this extreme st
age, but I listen to his -- to my  husband™s 
rationale, and th en it gets worse and worse and 
then it sort of star 
-- I start to de-focus 
from that. I can all of a sudd
en no longer focus on all thos
e rational explanatio ns. And 
one of the really horrible, horrible things that
 -- that I did to my self once, wh ich has never 
gone away  is, there was a program on televi
sion and I -- I watched it -- I don™t know why 
I watched it, I just -- I don™t know, I was 
tired  or something, and it was -- it was 
apparently  a true story. It was about a woma
n with a professional husband, I think maybe 
her husband was a doctor or something and th
e kid goes to buy something at a -- maybe 
in an electronics store and the mother gets 
worried. It was on PBS, 
I think. The mother 
gets worried and she says to the father, ﬁ
I™m worried about this -- my son.ﬂ And the 
father says, ﬁDon™t worry, he™ll be home soon,
ﬂ you know. And the mother gets just -- it 
was -- it was an almo st exact depiction of what
 I feel, and finally the mother says, ﬁI™m 
going to  see where he is.ﬂ And the mo ther 
goes and she follows his tracks and -- and 
figures out where he is and she walks into th is electronics store, which -- and there are 

some really bad criminals who have come
 in, and tied everybod
y on the floor, and 
they™ve actually -- and th
e mother actually gets killed, 
but the son survives and the -- 
these -- these criminals have tied everybody 
up and th ey -- I don™t know, they  robbed  the 
store or something, but they -- they pour ly e down ev erybody™s thro at that they™ve tied 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
87 
 
 
 
up. And that mo  -- that program has never 
left me, because every time now that I -- you 
know, this mu st have been 10 
years ago, that I have this conversation with my husband, 
and he says everything™s all 
right, immediately this -- this 
movie pops into my  head. And 
at the end of that movie, you see the son, wh
o is sort of damaged, but he™s kind of all 
right, with his father, talking ab
out that this is a real story,
 and this is what happened. 
And I -- I just replay that scen
e. Oh yeah, there™s the father
 saying everything™s fine, and 
the mother, in her gut, knew 
that something was wrong a
nd -- and so that now gets 
replayed in my h
ead, on top of all the normal stuff that
 gets replayed. So I -- And then -- 
And then the last stages, if 
they™re not home and it™s now 45 minutes, or an hour, which 
as I say, happens very rare
ly, sometimes I will just cr
ack up and weep. You know, and 
my husband will sit there and he™ll comfort me
 and then the phone rings and -- and all of 
a sudden, I come to absolute attention and 
you can hear nothing -- I make sure you can 

hear nothing of that in my  voice, and kid sa
ys, ﬁSorry Mo m, I got involved in  this, you 
know, I™m -- I™m just leaving 
fo r home.ﬂ And I s -- ﬁFine, did you have a good time? 
Great. Thanks for calling me, I really apprecia
te it.ﬂ And I hang up, 
you know, and then  I 
can finish kind of curing 
myself from the episode th
at has just transpired. 
Q: Wow. That™s a -- That™s a -- That™s powerful stuff. 

A: It is powerful stuff, but I don™t want you 
-- I want you to know that I live a reasonably 
normal life despite that, and I™m a very pr
oductive person and things like this don™t 
happen all that often. And as I say, I have
 been -- I mean, now my
 daughter™s in Israel, 
and guess what? She™s in Israel, 
she™s in Israel. All these horri
ble things happen in Israel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
88 
 
 
 
You know, bombs go -- get thro
wn into buses and 
you know, and I [indecipherable]. And 
my  friends tell me, well, you know, actually, if
 you lo ok at the statistics, Israel is safer 
than New York  City, and you 
know -- and I try to tell myself and you know, and so  on. 
But when she calls, it™s like th
is miraculously happy event. 
And she™s -- she™s been very 
good. You know, she -- she has 
called ev -- once a week. This
 week she sent me an e-
mail after sh -- three days after sh e called, 
and -- you know, but now 
she™s gone down to 
Ailot and I hope sometime this weekend, I™ll 
get a call. Damon™s going out to drive to -- 
to Amherst. If I go and drive, I mean, I think 
nothing of it. And both of our kids are good 
drivers, but there™s always that niggling -- you 
know, and I think th is 
is because I had this 
father, and one day he never ca
me back again. And I think 
there™s something deep down 
inside of me that is forever scared of that
 ever happening again. 
My  husband goes off on 
his bicycle to wo rk. He™s had -- you know, 
he™s bicycled safely for, I don™t know, 10 
years now, but he has had two somewhat not 
pleasant accidents, but not, you know, not 
horrible, horrible. Now, I tell him, ﬁLook, 
you™re a grown-up and I can™t do an ything bad 
to you as a grown-up. So yougot to call me the minute you ge
t to work.ﬂ And he™s very 

good about that, I mean, the minu
te he gets to work, he calls. 
And that was, at first, very 
short phone call. ﬁHello, I™m here.ﬂ ﬁOkay, by
e.ﬂ And then, at night -- at night, it™s dark, 
there are lights, there are cars
, can they see him? It™s h arder. Last night he came home 15 
minutes later than he said he would, wh ich is 
pretty -- not very usual. So, he said he™d  be 
home at 7:30. So at 7:32, I 
looked at the clock and by th
at time Damon had come back 
from Amherst, and -- so at least -- so I wasn
™t alone. When I™m alone, my imagination is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
89 
 
 
 
a lot worse than when there™s somebody else 
there. But, I™m still watching the clock, so 
7:35, I shouldn™t say anything. 7:40 -- ﬁI 
wonder wh ere dad is,ﬂ out loud. Damon -- I 
don™t know whether Damon even  noticed th at 
I said that or not. 7:41, I™m up at the 
bedroom window, lo oking out to see if ther
e™s any sign of him. ﬁLiane, Damon™s here, 
you can™t stay up here and watch at the 
window, because there™
s no point in worrying 
him.ﬂ So I come back do
wn  to the kitchen, and at 7:45, I 
hear the -- the door opening, so -
- and it™s okay. 
Q: And then  -- And then
 it™s all fine for you? 
A: Then it™s all fine. Then it™s all fine. Bu
t I -- But, you know, except for those few 
minutes, I go up there, I look -- I look ou
t the window. Maybe sometimes I waste a 
couple of mo re minutes, cause I™ll run down to
 the door or something. But I need you to  
know that 95, or 99 percen
t of the time, I™m productive and I™m work ing and I™m -- you 
know, I™m either making dinner or cleani
ng up, or doing work  wo rk -- you know, 
professional work or -- but these images invade . It™s like a kind of a 
Star Wars thing, you 

know it -- it™s like the spaceshi
p comes through and goes out
 the other side, because I 
force it to go out the other side.  
Q: And the images themselves, ar
e -- are they -- can you discuss th
em at all, o r is it just 
too difficult? 
A: It™s hard to discuss them, because they™re
 very unpleasant images. They™re -- They™re 
of something horrible happening. And I  -- I --
 I am -- So far, I am very good at making 
them go away again. So the im
ages that come, if 
I™m sitting and reading this and s -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
90 
 
 
 
I get some horrible image coming through my  
head, it™s in and out 
within, you know, one 
second. And -- And I -- And I just keep wo rki
ng, so -- so actually, I™m quite a productive 
person, an d I have not let that bother me, ex
cept that it bothers me that it happened. You 
know, it™s just -- it™s n o t a pleasant way to liv
e. And I -- I hope that -- you know, our -- 
I™ve discussed this with our children, becau
se -- you know, because I™ve tried to explain 
to them that sometime
s when I start crying, you know, I 
don™t know what it is and it™s out 
of my control and I never did this when I wa
s younger and I hope th
is will not happen to 
you and I apologize. And I think it gets d
iluted out. But anyway, I started telling you 
before that I wrote this poem after the -- th
e -- the Yom Kippur War, and I -- I wrote in 
that poem that -- about how all -- all the en
ergy and all the emotion that you put into 
bringing up a child, and then so
mebody can pop that child o
ff in -- in one second, in a 
war, on a highway, whatever, a
nd I -- and -- and th -- I think most people don™t -- don™t 
think about this. And I™ll tell you something else
 that I think about very often. I learned 
this in first grade, in PS 241. We had to
 memorize these little sayings. And one of the 
sayings that I had to memo rize was, ﬁA co
ward dies a thousand times, a brave man only 
once.ﬂ I don™t think a week goes by that I do
n™t think about that, be
cause I tell myself, 
you know, normal people don™
t live this way. Normal pe
ople live their lives, they™re 
happy, they do their thing. On
e day something comes up, it™s 
very bad news, they deal 
with it and then they 
go on. And you™re a coward, I say 
to my self, because you deal with 
all of these things in your im
agination, a zillion times a y ear, you know. So -- So I die a 
thousand times, instead of ju
st once. You know, but I mean
 da -- then I start asking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
91 
 
 
 
questions, well, you know, why is that? Is it 
all that, is it other things? And I -- And I 
think it -- it kind of started with that 
whole Ho locaust business and my  father™s 
disappearan ce. But then, you know, other peopl
e do things like -- people are generally 
not very thoughtful, and so  wh en I came  to
 New York, my mother
 was working in the 
factory and then my f -- brother left for schoo
l and he would be away
 all day, even when 
he was still going to Columbia and living at 
home. And so one day,
 I™m sitting alone in 
the house, I think I was doing 
homework , and a telegram arrives. Now, that was pretty 
unusual in those days. Telegram. So I open  th is telegram and it says, ﬁMother dead.ﬂ And 
I -- I must have been eight y
ears old, maybe nine and I did an emotional flip. Because I 
don™t know that I had ever seen a telegram be
fore, first o f all. Maybe -- Maybe I had, but 
I didn™t even -- 
End of Tape Three, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United St
ates -- United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum interview with Lian
e Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number four, side A. 
A: So I got this telegram, and it said, ﬁMot
her dead,ﬂ and I didn™t even notice that, you 
know, I don™t -- in these days, they probably 
don™t do that, but in those days, th-they 
would tape these little things on
, and I didn™t even notice that
 there was a name on the bo 
-- you know, two lines down, that somebody 
had glued on. I mean, I just read those 
words, mother dead, and I ju
st assu med  th at it was my  mo th er. And  I do n ™t rememb er 
how I resolved this. I might have gone to a ne
ighbor™s house or something, or -- or maybe 
I just finally noticed the thi
ng, but I -- I mean, I was a bask
et case fo r awhile there. And 
then I -- I guess the other thing which didn™t he
lp was that my mother
 -- after I was born, 
my  mo ther had gall bladder problems and in
 those days gall bladder surgery was not 
trivial. And then the war came
 anyway, so she lived for 30 
years with this gall bladder. 
And she would have these attacks and so
metimes an ambulance would come. But she 
would look -- I mean -- and especially after my
 brother left, and I 
was alone, you know, I 
would be absolutely terrified, be
cause here I was, this little gi
rl all b y  myself and my only 
-- my -- my  only means of survival was this
 woman. And she would get these horrendous 
attacks, which our son was just getting, recen
tly. But anyway, that™s a whole other story, 
but anyway, so -- so I think I -- I lived -- I liv
ed in a kind of -- I me
an, again, I wasn™t 
aware of it all the time, but wh en it happene
d, it was so scary. You know, that, oh my 
God, is this g -- the end of this, and I™m
 going -- you know, I™m going to end up all by 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
93 
 
 
 
myself, and wa -- what do I do? You know, what
 do you -- and I mean, 
I think a nine year 
old in 1999, who™s watched a lot of television, 
might be able to say, ﬁOh, well that™s all 
right, you know, I™ll go work as a cashier, 
or do so mething.ﬂ Bu t there was no television 
and I, from the reading that I did, I had no -- 
you know, I had no recour
se in my  head of 
what -- what do you do if you end up all by yo
urself as a little girl? So that was another 
thing that was pretty scary. 
Q: You know, y-you -- you men
tioned before, and -- and I just -- it reminded me when 
you talked about the telegram, 
was just the -- the legacy -- 
I™m just w o ndering about the 
legacy of this blue letter that came, the blue 
envelope. Is it somethi
ng that also you think 
about a lot? 

A: I -- I wouldn™t say I think about it a lot, 
but I do think about it fro
m time to time. My 
mother was sort of in a state 
of sh ock when she read this. It
 was one of those -- I think it 
was one of those air-o-gram th
ings, you know, and it detailed -- it was horrible, and then  
my mother read it to me. 

Q: What -- What do you remember from that? 

A: What I remember is it was written by a cous
in of -- of hers, I think. I think it was 
written by a guy names Moshe -- Moshe wh
at? I don™t remember. Moshe -- I don™t 
remember, but anyway, he ultimately moved to 
Israel. And he detaile
d what happened to 
all my mother™s relatives, and 
so  my  mo th er was re
ading this to me, about how her sister 
had been forced to watch, while  they threw her children into 
an oven, and th
en  th ey  sho t  
her. And my  mo ther™s brother had, I think th
ree children. I think 
my  mo th er™s si ster 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
94 
 
 
 
maybe had two children. I think the brother might
 have had three children, and that they -
- there was somebody in the concentration ca
mp where they were, 
who had typhoid or 
typhus, one -- one of those two 
bad diseases, and that a lot of people in the camp were 
snuggling up to these people, so
 that they wo uld c-contract the disease and be ab le to die 
of a disease, rather than what was obviou
sly going to  happen. And -- And so  that™s how 
those people met their end. I don™t -- I don™t reme
mb er -- I don™t think he detailed, except 
that my mother™s parents were killed, but -- 
in a concentration camp, but I don™t think he 
knew. I don™t rememb er exactly what happen
ed to th em. But he -- you know, he went 
through this litany of what happened to ev
erybody that she knew. And I -- I do think 
about that. I mean, I th ink about that, as I say ,
 not so often, but wh en I do think about it, I 

think, you know, ﬁH-How could she have st
ood that?ﬂ I mean, can you imagine? I mean, 
my  brother is now 72, I guess, or -- let™s see, 
I™m going to be 65, so he™s 72 and a half, or 
almo st 72 and a half, and well, th
is is another thing, I mean th
is is another abnormal thing 
that I have always lived with, and that is -- I 
wrote about this in -- in an article I wrote for 
the -- for Boston Magazine in 1988. When I say good
-bye to somebody, that is rarely an 
easy thing, because there is always this thing 
-- and I remember when my brother used to 
visit, cause I -- I really -- I was very, very cl
ose to my brother. Whenever I saw him off at 
the airport, and he™d go thro
ugh that door, onto the airplane, 
there™s always that thought, 
is this the last time? Y ou kn
ow, and now, I mean, he™s ge
tting older, and-- and every time 
I go away or I do something, I 
-- although I feel -- I feel mo
re equipped to cope with it 
now. I mean, I -- now, I-I think, ﬁOh, I™m 65, 
you know. I could go 
any day, my husband 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
95 
 
 
 
could go any day, and my  brother could cert
ainly go any day,ﬂ and 
you know, and I -- it™s 
still very scary, but it™s not as scary as it 
was when I was younger. 
But every time I -- 
there™s always that thought, you
 know, is this the last time 
I™m talking to th
is person? Is 
this the last time I™m s
eeing this person? And I™m sure th at
 has -- has got to go back to -- 
to what happened w
ith my father, you 
know? I mean, a -- 
Q: And all -- And all these other relatives, 
as well, from this le
tter, I m -- I imag ine. 
A: Yeah, but I think it was more my father, 
of -- you know, and so I think, ﬁWell, how 
could my  mo ther stand?ﬂ I mean, I don™t know wh ether she was close to her brothers and 
sisters, but you know, you -- 
it was kind of a reasonably clos
e knit family, and -- and so, 
how could she stand listening? 
You know, I mean, even when 
I repeat, and say they held  
my mother™s sister, while they
 threw her children into an 
oven. I mean, you know, foof. 
You know, even just when I rep
eat that, or think it to myself
 -- I mean, that is a -- a kind 
of unfathomable thought. So -- So when I -- I 
mean I -- you know, it ju
st totally gorks me 
out when I -- when I think abou
t that letter. And again -- and 
then I™m also bothered that, 
why don™t I have that letter? Where did that 
letter go? That letter -- That letter might be 
somewhere even in this house, although Idon™t know. You know, 
wh en  my  mo th er go t 
Alzheimer™s, she started thro wing out things 
and writing over things 
and so on. So I -- I 
don™t know. But where did that letter go? I™d 
like to see that letter ag ain. And I don™t 
know if I ever will find it. But -- 
Q: Well, you™ve also written in -- in some of 
the stuff that I was read ing, different articles 
in -- in the Boston Globe piece
s, ab-about the idea of -- of making up for others. D-Do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
96 
 
 
 
you -- Do  you feel that -- that you™re -- you™re 
living more than one life in a sense? That 
you™re living life for -- for -- for those who -- 
that -- that you have an  extra responsib ility, 
an extra burden? Do  -- Do you have that with you? 
A: I don™t think I think about that every da
y, but -- but yeah, when  I think ab out it and 
when I have to write, or when
 I™m thinking abou
t something about the past. I mean, I do 
feel that I h ave to pack a lot into every day.
 I -- I™m just -- I™m just n o w starting to even 
think about, I wonder what it would be like 
to retire, you know? And -- And I™m just 
starting to think -- for example, last week I 
felt a cold coming on, a
nd of course, when I 
was a kid, you know, if -- if you rememb er fr
om the -- from the -- the video in terview, 
my  mo ther would say, ﬁStay home.ﬂ And my
 brother would say, 
ﬁTake two hankies and 
go to  school.ﬂ 

Q: You can dry one out. 

A: Right. And so  all my life, I have -- I 
-- it -- colds get less 
as you get older, thank 
goodness, but I get really bad co lds. I don™t feel
 so bad, but I look awful. My  eyes are -- 
you know, are like buckets and my  nose a
nd it gets red and horrible and these -- the 
wonderful invention of lanolin tissues has  
helped a lot, but -- but
 I -- I just, you know, 
I™m -- my head is just so rrrrr. 
And a few years ago, one day, I -- I -- I got a cold and I 
just discovered that if -- if I -- if I keep 
wo rk ing, but I™m staying in a prone posi -- in a 
reclining position, horizontal position, that it™
s not so bad. And so I spent two whole days 
working in this chair that we
 just bought for my back, actu
ally, but where I can be lying 
down and still be reading and wr
iting at the same time. And th
en the cold really doesn™t

bother me at all, you know. And -- And also 
-- I me an, usually, all 
my  life, I™ve worked , 
you know, mo st days, mo st evenings, a lot on
 weekends. Not that we don™t take time off 
to have -- you know, to do nice things, 
mind you, but -- but when  I™m not doing 
something specifically , I™m work
ing. And now, in these last 
six months, with my  son, I 
mean, we™ve been watching a 
movie like practically every ni
ght. And it™s not necessarily 
a thoughtful movie, because he -- it turns out he has Crohn™s disease 
and so we try to find 
comedies. And sometimes they
™re  re -- they™re ki -- I 
mean, we try to find good 
comedies, but sometimes we™ve been watching thin
gs that are kind of stupid, just to kind 
of keep his mind occupied, and 
-- and -- and we sit next to 
him. So we™ve been work ing 
less hard during that time, and I -- I™m just 
suddenly th inking, you know, I don™t -- except 
on a summer vacation or something, I don™t ta
ke enough time to sme
ll the flowers. And 
that™s not really true, because I really do.
 I mean, I -- I™m very aware when those lilies 
come out, that I™ve got to go smell those. A
nd I -- I™m -- I™m all -- I™
m extremely aware of 
the passage of time. There™s a -- There™s a 
wonderful poem by A. E. Housman, called, 
ﬁWhen I was One and Twen ty,ﬂ in wh ich he sa
ys, ﬁand since to look at things in bloom, 
50 sp rings are little room, abou
t the woodland I will go, to
 see the cherry hung with 
snow.ﬂ So I™m always aware th
at, you know, when  the snow is
 freshly fallen, I have to go 
and look at it and touch it, and -- but I don™
t spend a lot of time just sitting down and 
contemplating. Now, I think th
at™s because I™m busy leading a lot of different lives, and 
trying to accomplish a lot of different things
. But sometimes, I also ask myself, maybe 
I™m rushing around an d doing all th-these things th
at keep me busy, because if I just sat in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

a grassy field and allowed myself to just 
free associate, maybe -- I would sp end a little 
time having some wonderful daydreams, but then maybe some of the nightmares would 
start creeping in  and that maybe wouldn™t be 
-- I -- I don™t know, I me
an I -- that™s just 
conjectural.  
Q: Di -- I was going to ask you whether -- eith er 
in daydreams, or -- or in -- or night -- at 
night, d-do you have flashbacks?
 Do you have dreams that e
ither have recurred or that -- 
that are disturbingly resonant of -- of 
that really traumatic past of yours? 
A: I hardly ever dream, and wh en  I do dream, 
I feel totally unrested
 in the morning. I 
mean, I know ev erybody dreams, but what I™m
 trying to tell you is, I™m not aware that I 
dream. When I have dreamt, it™s almost alw ays
 in black and white. I™ve only ha -- as far 
as I know, I™ve only had one 
Technicolor dream in
 my life, and it was -- it was a very 
scary dream, of some body running after me. My
 husband tells me th
at I somet imes see m 
to be dreaming at night and - 
-and you know, wince or cry 
or something, you know. But 
I™m -- I™m usuallyunaware
 of it in the morning.
 So I don™t dream very
 much, and that™s -- 
I think that™s been an incred
ible blessing, is my fantasti
cally wonderful sleep habits. 
Because I -- I -- I really get a lot out of 
my sleep. I don™t sleep a lot of hours. 

Q: How many hours? 
A: I™ve actually been  sleeping mo re lately, but I think th roughout my  life, I probably 

don™t often sleep mo re than six hours. I mean
, I tend to go to sleep quite late, an d I™m 
usually up by so mewhere between
 7:30 and eight. And sometimes
 if a client gives me 
something to  do, or if I have something to
 do -- now th at™s something that™s changed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
99 
 
 
 
recently. I used to stay up un
til, you know, like five in th
e morning, that wa -- not 
uncommonly, and still get up, but -- and in the 
last maybe five years or so, my husband 
has started going to  sleep, sort of between mi
dnight and one. And unless I -- I have to do 
something, I start to get this
 uncomfortable feeling. I™ll be
 sitting at my computer, and 
he™ll come down  and kiss me 
goodnight, and go up to  bed and 
-- and I used to just say 
okay, and -- you know, and then  -- I -- and then 
I™d get right back into  it, and keep going. 
And now, there™s something that happens, and I 
-- I actually feel a little irritated at people 
around me for this, but I start to feel, oh, I™m too old to do this. I -- I -- I better get -- I 
better go up and go to sleep. And I don™t -- I 
don™t think there™s really anything that™s 
changed physiologically, but I th
ink it™s hearing people constant
ly  say, ﬁWhat? You go to 
sleep at two o™clock in the mo rning? I™m in 
bed by nine o™clock at 
night.ﬂ You know, and 
I -- I think it™s like that -- the -- the economics guy at Harvard, the tall -- Galbraith wrote 

an article in  the newspaper about somethin
g he called the still syndrome. He say s, you 
know, part of the reason that you ag e is that
 as you get on in life, people keep asking, 
ﬁOh, do you still walk? Do you
 still run?ﬂ And if you look at a pretty woman, ﬁOh, are 
you still interested?ﬂ And he calls that the still
 syndrome. And I feel a little as th ough I™m 
maybe getting victimized a little, b y  other peop
le telling me that I should no longer be 
doing wh at I™m doing, and that maybe it™s some
how getting to me, because by and large, 
I™m usually in bed by one o™clock and -- and I 
turn off the light by, 
you know, 1:30 or -- 
or something. And -- And I don™t stay up 
m-much later than th
at, unless there™s a 
pressure.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
100 
 
 
 
Q: That seems like really late to me
, I™m usually in bed by 10 o™clock. 
A: No, no, I know, but the 
thing is that I™m not -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you know, and I -- I -- I never needed a 
lot of sleep and I™m generally quite perky. 
And I think there is so mething that the soci
ety and th e people around me are doing to me 
that™s -- that™s -- maybe that™s a 
rationalization, I don™t know, but -- 
Q: You know, I wanted to ask 
you just -- you mentioned in a 
couple of the articles that 
you™re working on a book. Is that
 -- Is that still in process? Is
 that -- I don™t mean to use 
the still word. Is that something that you™ve fi
nished or is that some
thing that you™re still 
working on, is what I mean. 

A: I™m still working on it, but first of all, I don
™t have a lot of time, and I -- for example, 
you know, I really thought so
mehow, that I was going to  maybe slow down  on my  wo rk 
work  life and pay mo re attention 
to this, and then this thing ca
me up with our son. And so 
now, I™m doing even  less work wo rk. There 
are a couple of things that have happened 
with that project. First of all,
 I™m very success oriented, and 
I™m -- I didn™t try very hard, 
but I made a couple of stabs some years ago,
 at finding a publisher, and I didn™t find a 
publisher, and th at got me to put the proj
ect on the back  burner. I know my self well 
enough to know that if I got a publisher tomo
rrow, I™d be in there working til five o™clock 
in the morning. I mean, I -- I -- I k n ow that. So that was 
one thing that happened. The 
second th ing that happened was that I -- maybe
 my project was overly ambitious to begin 
with, and about a year before
, Simon Shallma, who was a hi
story professor at Harvard, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
101 
 
 
 
who moved to Colu mbia, I had a meeting with 
him, because h-he -- when  he was in high 
school, he had written an article for the Lond
on Times, when he wa
s living in England, 
about the San Louis, and -- and he gave a talk 
at our library and I started to talk to him 
and I asked him if I could meet with him, an
d I told him about what I was trying to do 
with my  San Louis book. And 
he made some very interes
ting suggestions for  paring 
down the project. So then I ki
nd of rethought the project a
nd decided that he was right, 
that I couldn™t do -- I mean, my original pr
oject was to try to incorporate stories from -- 
that I™d collected from 40 people 
and th at™s not going to fly. He
 suggested that I pick five 
to seven stories and -- and that I put my  chapter about the reunion, wh ich I had coming at 
the end, that I should put it up at the front, an
d he made a lot of interesting suggestions. 
Q: Yeah, they do sound interesting. 

A: But then I st -- I wa
s working on my  brother™s chapter, because -- and I had 
interviewed my  brother, my  brother did not want to do -- write his own ch apter. So I 
interviewed him several times, and I wrote a chap
ter for him, which I sent to him. This is 
only now like maybe a year ago that I fini
shed that chapter. My brother was very 
disturbed to find that I had written his chap
ter in the first person, as though he was 
writing it. And he said I couldn™t -- h-he didn™t
 feel good about that, that I couldn™t really 
do that. So, then I started trying to rethi
nk. So, I™m going to write his chapter third 
person. And then, so mehow, that didn™t seem 
right. And so, my chapte
r is going to be the 
longest chapter in the 
book, cause it™s going to  contain a lo
t of stuff that I™m telling you. 
And then  my  brother™s chapter was going to 
be the other long chap
ter, but now I am in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
102 
 
 
 
the process of maybe rethinking the whole 
thing again. I think maybe I™m going to 
incorporate my  brother™s intervie
w into a story that I tell.  
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And that has caused me now to think about
 maybe this book is not going to  be about 
anybody but us, but then the qu
estion arises, what do I do 
with, for example, there™s a 
chapter of a woman down in  Ne
w Jersey, who -- which is alr
eady finished, signed, sealed 
and delivered. She wrote it, I 
edited it, I got permission le
tter from her to publish it. 
That™s the one bit of comple
te thing I have. Am I lettin
g those people down? I guess 
there™s a -- I guess I have an overactive consci
ence and I™m always sort of worried about 
letting down . And th is guy, who organized the re
union, he s -- he stupidly sent me a lot of 
stuff and didn™t -- didn™t even register it or a
nything, and all his original pictures got lost, 
and -- and he has called upteen times over th
e years, ﬁOkay, wh en  is your book coming 
out,ﬂ and so on and so forth. Okay, so that™s 
one side of the story. So  now, I don™t know 
what to do with this and my 
current thought is maybe -- ma
ybe I™m going to  either follow 
Simon Shellma™s idea partly, or ma
ybe this book is going to be
 just about us, and the rest 
is going to the 
Holo caust mu seum. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: All those two huge boxes I have of notes 
and pictures and so on
. But something else 
happened  in  the interim. About in wh at mu
st have been, I don™t know, maybe 1990 or 
something, we used to go to  an island in 
Maine every summer, for a few weeks. And so 
on this one summer, w e were going to this 
island, and I thought 
to  my self, ma y b e  we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
103 
 
 
 
should do so me constructive fami ly project th
is year. Let™s write a fictional story, all 
together. So, we got up to Ma
ine and I said, ﬁOkay, so you 
know, we™re all going to sit 
down  and we™re going to write this story,ﬂ sort
 of like that game that you play, you know, 
you write and -- except that we™re going to  kn
ow, and we™re going to -- now this was not 

an original idea. I got this 
idea because there was a medica
l doctor that I heard give a 
talk, and he wrote a best seller
 called ﬁThe Sisterhood.ﬂ And he
 gave a talk at a meeting, 
and he talked about how 
he wrote this book, but he wrote 
it with the help from a lot of his 
friends. And he told  this whole very funny 
story, wh ich I™m not going to  go into , but 
that™s where I got this idea of doing this jo
int project. Well, my  husband was not terribly 
excited about this project. Our son, who has 
been drawing since age two and now paints, 
really wanted to pain t, and our
 daughter likes to go and fetch sea animals out of the sea 
and then throw them back, when
 she™s in Maine, and sh e was not at all enthused about 
this writing project. So, the first d ay, I was 
really feeling very 
sour grapesy on this 
vacation, about, you know, oh, 
I had this great idea and we
 could, you know, we could 
write this great story and maybe it could ev en 
get published, and so  we went off to sit on 
-- a-at the ocean, on the rocks 
in Monheegan, and my husband was drawing, my son was 
drawing, Erica was fishing stuff out of the se
a and I™m sitting there with a pad and pencil, 
looking, you know, forlorn and angry or some
thing. And suddenly 
this idea for a story 
popped into my head. And I st
arted writing down this story,
 all by myself. And when we 
came home from Maine, I was gung-ho involved in
 th is story like I don™t think I™ve been 
involved  in too many th ings before. And I didn™
t have a lot of work 
to do that summer, so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
104 
 
 
 
the whole summer, the kids were off doing thei
r own things, my husband left for work in 
the mo rning, I was already wo rk ing out of 
the house by then. The whole -- almo st the 
whole rest of the summer, I sat in front of
 my computer from th
e minute Sam left, until 
the time he came home, essentially, and I wrote 
this story, which tu rned out to be, I don™t 
know, 333 double spaced pages. 
Totally fictional story, but ha
s bits and pieces of things 
that happened. It starts out in
 th e Holo caust, and etcetera. And I thought it was kind of a -
- a good story. And I -- The thing th at -- that
 I found very bizarre 
was that while I was 
sitting at my computer, writing this story, 
I found myself laughing and crying. And I 
would stop my self and say, 
ﬁWhat are you doing, Liane, yo
u™re making all this up, why 
are you laughing and why are you 
crying?ﬂ And I was just incr
edibly involv ed in this 
story. So , I finished writing this story, and 
then I thought, well, I sh ould send it o -- I -- I 
should see if I could get this published, beca
use I thought it was certainly better than -- I -
- I sort of thought of it like an hour and a ha
lf television script, and I thought, you know, I 
think this is better than a lot of things I™ve se
en, I ought to be able 
to get this published. 
So, first I called Ann Bernai
se, who had been  a Barnard 
graduate, and who lives in 
Camb ridge and who™s pub
lished a lot of books. 
Q: I know her, yeah. 
A: And she gave me the name of her agent, 
and I called the agent an
d the agent said to 
me, ﬁIs this a literary s -- novel?ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁNo, this is not a 
literary novel, this is just a 
fun story, a good story.ﬂ And sh e said, ﬁWell,
 I don™t deal in things that are not literary 
novels.ﬂ So, all right, so that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
105 
 
 
 
Q: Dear me. 
A: So th at was the end of th
at. So anyway, then I don™t kn
ow, I tried a couple of other 
people, they -- they -- people that I knew. [ind
ecipherable] I -- I didn
™t feel I was getting a 
lot of enthusiasm. One day I got a telephone 
call from a guy who was working at PBS, he 
wants to come and interview me. Okay, so he
 came and interviewed me and I said, ﬁYou 

know, I have a favor to  ask, but please don™t 
do it unless, you know, th-this is something 
that -- that would really be of interest.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁYou know, you work
 for television, I -- I 
wrote this story, I think it wo
uld make a good hour and a half 
TV thing, I wonder if you™d 
be willing to read it?ﬂ He said, ﬁSure, but 
right now I™m very busy.ﬂ I tried to call him 
about six or seven times in the next year a
nd he was always very busy. So  I thought, ah 
he -- you know, he™s not really interested. 
A few years later, one day, I was about to 
leave, I think fo r Europe the next day, I get 
a phone call from this guy. He says, ﬁOkay, 
I™m getting married in 10 days, my
 wife is studying for her ba
r exams, I can read your -- 
Fedex me your manuscript, I can read it in th
e next 10 days.ﬂ So, I was kind of amazed 
and I -- I Fedexed this thing off to him, and 
he then -- when -- when
 I -- when we both 
got -- wh en I got back  from my  trip, and he 
got back from his honeymoon or something, 
he spent an hour and a half on th e phone w
ith me, telling me what
 he thought was good 
and bad about this script. And so I tried to in
corporate some of his 
suggestions into the -- 
into this manuscript, and I -- I -- I did a fa
ir amount of additional 
work on it, and th en 
somebody gave me the name of an agen t. My me
mory these days is -- is terrib le. Well, it 
doesn ™t matter, but anyway, it™s a -- it™s a -- 
th e mother had gone to Barnard College, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
106 
 
 
 
daughter I once tuto red in algebra when  she 
was a kid and we went
 on vacation together. 
And this girl has n -- this wo
man has now written a couple of
 successful novels, so she 
gave me the name of her agent. And I sent th
is off to this agent, 
and this agent said -- 
wrote me a letter and said something like, this
 is a good story idea, but there™s too mu ch  
telling, and not enough showing. And that™s a phrase I™ve heard, you know, a zillion 
times from people who write. Well, I was busy 
and I was discourag ed and so I just kind 
of put that thing aside. And th
en, about three years ago, I fi
nally -- I had been trying to 
take a course in writing and I took a course
 -- a 10 week course with some woman in 
Camb ridge, you know one night a week, for th
ree hours or something, in writing -- in 
memo ir writing, and not wo rking on th at th
ing, wh ich was not really a memo ir, but a 

novel, but because I thought it would help me
 write th e San Louis book. And I did learn a 
lot, but that was only three years ago, and 
I™ve just been unbelievably busy since then, 
and somehow, I -- I know -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Liane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number four, side B.  

A: I know that I need to 
be wo rk ing on the San Louis 
book. And, you know -- And my 
husband is now getting into th e act. Ever
y week he says, ﬁAll right, when  are you 

finishing your book?ﬂ And I really -- I really wa
nt to finish it, not just because I want to 
finish it, but there™s so mething that tells me 
it is my  oblig ation to  
write this thing. I -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
107 
 
 
 
That I have a moral, or ethical,
 or whatever you want to call 
it, thing, that I must do this. 
And sometimes I get n ervous, cause I say, ﬁO
h my  God, the years are passing, you know, 
you could die tomorrow, and y
ou will not have finished this
 book, and you will have -- 
have not fulfilled your obl
ig ation.ﬂ But, there is something 
in side of me that wants to see 
this novel get published, or aired or some
thing. Why? I don™t 
-- I don™t know why, 
because I put -- I think it™s just
 because -- beca -- I put so much
 of my emotional self into 
writing that bloody thing, and 
I think it is sort of a good st
ory. I think it™s a story that 
young people could learn from, but may not u
nderstand, because -- because I write in it a 
lot about the morays of the 
1950™s, you know, and -- and th
at kind of stuff. And the -- 
And I -- You know, and I sort of can imagine that some kid who™s 20 years old now, 
would read this and say, ﬁH
uh?ﬂ You know, ﬁI-Is this so me
 kind of thing from the middle 
ages or something?ﬂ But it™s not from the middl e ages, that™s really the way things were 

in my world, in 1950. But 
it™s also -- it™s also kind of 
funny and -- and -- and -- and 
whimsical and tragic and you 
know, an-and -- and I -- I really do think it™s a good story 
and I think it™s a lot better than
 a lot of things I hear. But 
-- So -- So -- So every time I 
think, ﬁOh well, you know, tomo rrow, if I ha
ve a couple of hours, I™ll work on th e San 
Louis book,ﬂ then something says, ﬁOh, mayb
e you should just try 
to make this novel 
better first.ﬂ And then I wonder, maybe there™
s something I don™t u
nderstand about show 
me versus tell me. I mean, I™ve learned that, 
I™ve learned it in classes, but maybe there™s 

something in ternally that I don™t understand
 enough ab out that concept, you know. And 
then I think, ﬁWell ma ybe I should get help  w
ith this,ﬂ but then -- then I don™t like that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
108 
 
 
 
idea, because that™s -- that™s
 -- that™s like finking out, or 
you know. And I 
shouldn™t say 
that, because I help people write their grant 
proposals, that™s how I make the major part 
of my income now, you know, and -- and that™s 
fine, they just don™t 
know how to write it, 
and I™m teaching them how to do it. But yet, I can
™t accept that, at least not for this thing.  
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So, I don™t know, I don™t know, I don™t know
 where these are going to go. I mean, you 
know, maybe I™ll get hit by a truck tomo rrow and then  -- and this will get buried with me, 

or -- or you know, I mean, one of the things that
 I worry about w
ith my son™s art, is it™s so 
hard getting ahead in  the wo rld of art, and 
-- and -- you know, and I think he™s really 
quite good and he has -- in the 
last few years, three of his 
paintings have been sold by 
galleries, for about 10 grand each. [phone ringing] So -- So I don™t -- I -- I don™t quite 

know -- I don™t quite know how to
 deal with this, because I really -- I really want to get 
these -- I w ant to see these two things published,
 if it™s the last thing that I do. But I can™t 
sto -- you know, some days I™ve ev en thought
, ﬁWell, you know, I™m si -- I™m going to  be 

65, maybe I should retire, and maybe I should ju
st work on this other stuff.ﬂ B u t how can 

I retire when I™ve got a son who™s an artist, 
who really -- you know, 
the gallery keeps 50 
percent, so it sounds great, he sol -- sold 
a painting for 10 grand. But how mu ch of that 
does he get? Five. He™s done three of -- of t
hose projects in the last three years. So how 
do you live on that? You can™t. I mean, basically
, we™re supporting him, to a large extent. 
I mean, he has m -- you know, he does sell a bunc
h of other things in the meantime, so -- 
so he™s -- he™s kind of starting to come into 
his own, but he™s not qui
te there yet. How can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043

I stop working, you know, in -- in
 -- in this situation. I mean
, our daughter is essentially 
now 99 percent financially independent. Sh e -- 
Sh -- You know, I taught her how to write 
grant proposals, she got every grant 
in the -- that was available. She -- 
Q: What does she do? 
A: She™s an anthropology graduate student. 

Q: Oh, you mentioned that, yeah. 
A: And she -- she™s doing her field wo rk in  Po
land now, but she went
 to Israel to see 
some people and to do some interviews. So I 
don™t wo rry as mu ch about her financially, 
but I still worry a lot about our son, financially
 and now that he™s si
ck, and Crohn™s is a -- 
a chronic kind of diseas
e, you know, he -- it could never ha
ppen ag ain, or he could get it 
every three months or so mething. So how 
can I possibly stop wo rking fo r income? You 
know, so -- so ha -- and now, I mean I™m -- I™
m ha -- tied up with  him half the time, you 
know, doing things for him. He
 rented an apartmen
t three months ago, he™s been paying 
the rent, and he can™t move in. No w, he™s
 going to have anot
her surgery on July  20
th
, 
because -- because they 
put him on this IV feed, and it caused his gall bladder to -- you 
know, and why didn™t they tell me
 about that, and rrrrr. But anyway. 
Q: Geez. 
A: So -- You know, so I don™t know. I mean
 I -- You know, and then -- and then my 
husband had -- turned  out to ha
ve prostate cancer, and I think 
he™s all right, but then it -- 
it rees -- he had his prostate out, it resurfa
ced and -- and the -- the -- I brought Damon 
home from England after two 
surgeries, on Novemb er 14
th
, which was my  birthday. On

Novemb er 16
th
, my  husband started seven weeks of ra
diation therapy. An
d he seems to be 
all right, but, you know, what do
es all right mean? I mean, th
is could pop up again, you 
know, who knows?  
Q: It™s -- 

A: Maybe never, maybe sometimes. You know, ho
w can I take time off to do this other 

thing, wh ich is sort of frivolous, you know? 
Am I really  a writer? No, I™m not really a 
writer, I™m really kind of a scientist. So, ca
n I -- You know, and I -- and I don™t like doing 
things that are not successful. I don™t do 
well doing projects that don™t succeed. For 
example, when I was a kid, I was -- I joined 
botan ic garden club, I had my  six foot six 
pot, I went every mo rning and I hoed and we
eded and ev erything, and I got all these 
vegetables to take home to my mother. And 
that was wonderful. Now,
 do I even want to 
go out and plant a single bulb? 
No. Because that™s not my  thing, that™s not going to bring 
me recognition or su ccess. That
™s not going to  make my  child
ren happy, that™s not going 
to -- you know. I -- I™m -- For better or worse,
 and you can criticize this, but I -- I™m very 
goal oriented. So, if somebody came and said, ﬁL
iane, this is a terrifi
c idea, all it needs is 
-- is a year of your work ing on it,ﬂ I could 
conceivably drop half of
 what I™m doing and 
say, ﬁOh, wo w, okay, this is going to get p
ublished. I™m going to  make this thing work .ﬂ 
But the -- You know, and I sh -- I shouldn™t 
do th is, cause I tell people, you know, ﬁIf -- 
If at first you don™t succeed, try, try and again.
ﬂ You don™t get your grant funded the first 
time, you have to do it twice, three times, 
you know. Some people have to write eight 
before they get one funded. But for -- for -- 
And I will do that with a grant application, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
111 
 
 
 
although I never had to do that. I mean, I alw a
ys got fu nded, either 
the first time, or in 
one case, maybe the second tim
e. I™m not sure I even had 
to ever rewrite, may b e once. 
But -- Bu t you know, I am accust
omed to being su ccessful at the things that I™m good at, 
and I -- you know, s -- you know, this one 
woman who finally had a book of poetry 
published, she™s a professor at BU, she said
 she wrote a hundred letters to publishers, 
before her book of poetry got
 published by a really good po
etry press, University of 
Pittsburgh. And I -- Okay, yes, I know all abou
t that, you know, but I don™t have time to 
do th at, with everything else that™s going on. 
And -- I mean I know that™s s -- th at sounds 
like a spoiled brat, but I really -- I -- I want so
mebody to appear and say, ﬁOkay, this is a 
-- this is good, we just have to fix this a
nd that,ﬂ you know, let™s -- if I -- you know, and 
th -- and then with the -- with 
the San Louis book, there™s this
 other problem, and th at is 
that book, especially if I us
e Simon Sh allma™s idea, which I may or may not go back  to, 
people have sent me pictures, documents, wo
nderful things. Those need to be in that 
book, and yet the publishing
 industry tells me, you kno
w it™s really in-incredibly 
expensive to publish a well illustrated book. We
™re -- We™re not going to do that. B-By 
the way, I want to show you so mething else
. That -- That book is highly illustrated, but 
the book is a mess. The guy did a miserable 
job. It™s so -- The pictures are poor quality, 
it™s full of typos.  
Q: The -- Which book are you talking about? 

A: This is a book that was -- 
that origina -- this is a book th
at changed my  life around. It 
came out, I think, in 1974, called ﬁVoyage 
of the Damn ed,ﬂ by Th
omas Gordon and Max 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
112 
 
 
 
Morg anwitz, about the San Louis. Somewh at fictionalized story. I disco -- I -- One night, 
my  husband and I were looking in the Ne
w York  Times magazine, and there was a 
review, I think, of -- of this book, or maybe
 it was the book review. I went out and bought 
that book. I was extremely disturbed, and so
mething funny happened
. I read that book, 
and then  I immediately forgot a lot of what
 it said. And I know -- And then I read it 
again, and the same thing happen ed, and I -- 
I kept thinking, the voyage of the damn ed, 
the damned, the damned. That™s me they™re talking about. That was sort of a really 
horrifying thing, you know, to
 be referred to that way. 
Q: Did you ever think of
 yourself that way? 
A: Well, I never had, until this book came 
out, you know, and then I thought, ﬁOh my 
God, that™s me. That title is about me, and 
all these other people wh o were on the ship.ﬂ 
So, anyway, I ca -- I -- a-at -- at some point
, I actually contacted the authors and -- and 

then many years later, I got contacted by th is
 guy, I don™t even remember the name, 
David -- David something or other. It™s on -- 
on my  computer, who decided he was going 
to re-issue the ﬁVoyage of the 
Damned,ﬂ in a highly illustrate
d form, and he asked me for 
a lot of photographs, wh ich I sent. So this
 new book came out, maybe about 1994, or 
something. Lot of pictures, a lot of pictur
es and there™s a -- he had cameos, two page 
cameos of different families, and there™s one
 of me and my fam
ily, and you know, my 
father with me in a stroller, and all sorts of pict
ures. So I -- I want my book, if I -- if I put 
other people™s stories into it, or even if 
it™s ju st mine, I want it to have all those 
documents, you know, I have all these 
documents. I™ve got a wonderful document 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
113 
 
 
 
downstairs, that -- that -- that my father got
. My father fought, as
 a young man, in the 
Austrian war, in World War One, and if he 
had lived, and come to the United States, he 
would have fought on th e oppos
ite side in World War Two, and that in itself is crazy. 
You go and you fight people and kill people, a
nd it™s purely -- it has nothing to do, often, 
most of the time, with your ph
iloso phy. It has to do 
with where you happen to  be born, or 
where you happen to be livi
ng. Do es that ma ke any sense? No. An d so I have this 
document that -- that very picturesque document 
that my father got, cause he was actually 
wounded during the first war. And I™ve got lo
ts of wonderful -- you know, I™ve got this 
thing that my  father had to sign, saying 
th at he wouldn™t practice any mo re. I™ve got 
documents from Poland, I™ve got 
my  parents marriage license, you know, all these things 
that should go into th
is book, but everybody 
tells me, well the more 
you want to illustrate 
it, the less is the chance that you™re ever goi
ng to get this publishe
d. So that™s another 
kind of a downer. 
Q: Maybe if -- if you could publish it with an 
organization th at has an interest in -- in 
seeing the story come out, ma
ybe that™s [indecipherable] 
A: Well, I™ve called the Holocaust museum, 
and there is a guy, whose name I don™t 
reme mb er, that I spoke to, who™s in charge of
 -- because they do publish some books, and 
he didn™t make it sound very  promising. But se
e, I -- I g u ess -- I mean
 this is probably not 
a nice quality that I have, but -- but I™m -- I™m s 
-- I™m sic -- well, I™m success oriented, so 
I would be satisfied if the book could just ge
t published, but I would 
be not happy if I had 
to do a vanity publishing. You know, a lot of
 people that I know -- I belong to this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
114 
 
 
 
survivor™s group, and a lot of those people -- we
ll, not a lot, several of those people have 
published books. And you kn
ow, they prin t -- I don™t know
, a hundred copies, it cost 
them 8,000 dollars, looks like a nice book. 
People who are ignorant of the publishing 
industry are not aware that they
 p-paid to have it published,
 you know, and just looks as 
though they  wrote this book. 
That doesn™t sit right with me
. I don™t want to pay to have 
my book published, because if
 I pay to have my book pub
lished, it could 
be crap. You 
know, if I publish a book -- wh ich I have pub
lished three books about proposal writing, 
it™s because I did it well, it™s a good job. 
Those books have been
 well received, well 
reviewed. You know, it™s some
thing of quality. So -- So 
if I -- if I get my novel 
published, I don™t want to self publish that, I 
want it to be published and I want it to get a 
reasonably good write up. You 
know, not everybody has to l
ove it, but I want it to be 
something that somebody™s willing to do, cause 
they think it™s worth 
publishing. So -- So 
anyway, here I am and -- and right now, wh
at am I going to do between now and -- I 
mean, when -- when does my
 hus -- when does my  son get to move into his own 
apartment and be on his own ag ain? You know
, I mean, in other words, when can I get 
back to being 100 percent me ag
ain, whatever that means. So
, whenever that happens, if 
I™m still around and kicking and 
haven™t gotten Alzheimer™s dis
ease yet, that™s when I™m 
going to make the next big m
ove on, I hope, both of these projects, or maybe one will 
take precedence. I -- I -- I don™t know. So I f -- 
I feel that I owe it to somebody, not just 
me, who do I owe it to? I don™t know, I owe it to
 my  mo ther, to my  father, to all those 
people who died, that I write th
e story, that I write what happ
ened. So that™s an -- sort of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
115 
 
 
 
an obligation. The novel part? 
That™s just an obligation to my self. I don™t -- Why, I don™t 
know, maybe just to prove that 
I can do this other thing, I 
-- I -- I™m not sure. But -- But 
anyway, so I have these two sort of big proj
ects to do, and in the meantime, you know, I 
look around me, like t h
is morn -- I mean, I already warned
 you what our house looks like, 
but this morning, I came down and I looked 
at our house and I thought, ﬁOh my  God, 
there is no way, even  if I could spend fu ll time for three months with  my  husband, there 
is no way that we can this place back into
 order.ﬂ You know, I mean, here™s my son™s 
little -- a tentative, you know, at home studio. There™s the little hospital under the table. 
You know, here™s this project that I™m doi
ng for that. You know, it -- it™s -- it™s like a 
shambles and -- you know, so 
here I™m thinking ab out these 
big projects, that really 
require time, and you know, and th en a part
 of me thinks of my self as being non-
vulnerable, and the other part of me keeps 
saying, ﬁYou know, Sam™s been sick, your 
son™s been sick, you™re s -- getting to be 65
 years old, what makes you th ink you might 
not get sick tomo rrow, and you ma
y not be able to finish this project.ﬂ So it™s -- it™s kind 
of a real conundrum about, 
you know, how is this going to
 play out, and I -- and you™re 
young en ough so  that you may know the answer
 some day, but you know, I -- I just -- I 
just know that each day I get up and there are 
a list of things that I have to do, that™s a 

mile long and -- and the -- the two books are ki
nd of sitting on my b
ack like -- like these 
two kind of weights that keep sort of bangin g 
at the back of my  skull, but they™re not all 
that high up on the list right
 now. You know, I have six 
business trips between now and 
November, which, if Damon were not ill at 
the moment, is probabl
y, you know, not an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
116 
 
 
 
awful lot, but I -- you know, I ha
ve to do some prep work fo
r some of those and so wh en 
do I fit this thing in? I don™t know. 
Q: Well, I wish you luck in -- 
in having -- in sorting all this out, and figuring out how to 
do it, you know. I really hope you can. 
A: Well, I -- I -- You know, and -- and I™m goi
ng to have to bite th
e bullet one of these 
days, I mean I -- when I -- when 
I get around to doing this is
 to -- or before I get around 
to doing this is, I™ve got to find a publis her, because I know that if I find a publisher, 

that™s what going to  spur me on. And so that -- 
that really is  the first step and that™s not 
an e -- I mean, that™s a really
 big, time consuming project. 
Q: Oh, I mean, I™ve written four book propos
als and I finally have gotten one accepted 
after a long time. I me
an, you just -- justpitching constantly. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: [indecipherable] I™m 
just like well, grants can be the same way. 
A: Oh ab solute
ly, absolutely. 
Q: Just a swing and a miss for so many times. 

A: Right, right. 
Q: Well, I wanted to ask 
you a couple mo re things. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Just -- Just a few factual things, and then 
-- then this sort of one concluding th ing and 
then, unless you have anything else. Going back
 again to -- to when 
you™re a -- a girl, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
117 
 
 
 
-- and had arrived here, were there any -- an
y groups, any refugee groups or -- or aid 
groups that you all tapped into? Was that 
-- Was that part of your early life here? 
A: My mother did go to a nu
mber of different places where she got some help. Didn™t 
seem to get a lot of guidance, but got some 
help. I don™t -- I don™t know very  mu ch about 
that. The only thing that affected me personally
 was my mother went to some places that 
-- that got me sent to summer 
camp for I think, three weeks 
each -- for -- for each of three 
summers. I really hated that. I ha
ted that with a passion. I didn
™t want to go away, I didn™t 
want to leave my mother. And because my mo
ther™s English was not 
very good, the first 
time, I actu ally got sent to an all Catholic camp. 
Q: How was that? 
A: It was just a mistake, I m
ean, my mother didn™t either ask 
or pick up or I -- I don™t -- I 
mean, I don™t know. 

Q: Obviously this wasn™t a Jewish
 organization that arranged this. 
A: Ob-O bviously not. And so that was -- that 
was a really weird experience, to the point 
where -- and -- and you weren™t allowed to  
wear your own clothes. You -- It wasn™t 
exactly a uniform, but you got these colorful, ve
ry bad, in bad taste,
 you know sunsuits or 
something, to wear. A-And by 
the way, you know this is -- 
y-you know, I ha -- I have a 
lot to say about rearing kids, cause I -- I -- th
at™s a pet peeve, is that people don™t do 
things right with children, and I am very prot
ective of -- of wh at you do and don™t do to 
children. Wa -- Every Thursday night, at this
 ridiculous place, they came around with 
shot -- with a tray of shot glasses full of M
ilk of Magnesia, and every kid had to drink a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
118 
 
 
 
shot glass of Milk of Magnes
ia. And the other thing was th
at at night, you had to get 
tucked in  to your bed, and th ese -- I don™
t know wh ether they were maybe nuns who 
didn™t have full habits on, I don™t even reme
mb er, but the -- whoever was in charge of th e 
camp would come around, and you™d get tuck
ed into  bed, and they would pull the 
blanket, you know, like rrrrr, then tuck it in, 
so -- and you -- you ba
sically couldn™t move 
around in  your bed. And so  I was really trauma
tized at that camp. First of all, one night I 
-- I happened to wake up and one of the kids
 was sleepwalking, and there was a whole 
commotion, but also, at the end of
 that time -- first of all, 
wh en  my  mo th er
 came to pick 
me up, we walked right by -- by each other 
and she didn™t recognize me and I didn™t 
recognize her. That™s pretty bizarre. The other th
ing was, I cried a lot 
when I had to go to 
camp, every time. I really hate -- I d -- I -- you 
know, I really didn™t want to go. The other 
thing that happened is that for the rest of 
my life, even now, although now I don™t -- I™m 
not as apt t-to do it as -- as quickly, but for 
the rest of my life, in
 my adult life, when I 
come into a hotel, you know, the beds are alwa
ys made and th ey™re always tuck ed in. Or 
if I go to somebody™s house who™s a bedmaker, th
e beds -- first thing I do, I look at a bed, 
it™s made, I™m about to have to get into it, 
the first thing I do is I go around and pull the 
sheet out from all the sides, because I cannot 
stand to be in a bed where the sheets are 
tucked in. You know, it™s lik
e -- it makes me feel as
 though I™m in prison. 
Q: Confined -- Confined, yeah. 
A: And that™s -- And that™s
 -- I™m sure that comes fro
m that stupid camp. So -- 
Q: So, well -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
119 
 
 
 
A: So anyway, so that™s the ma
in help that I think I got, if
 you want to call it help, was 
being sent for this summer vacatio n. 
Q: So, well -- A-And -- And how about when yo
u were raised, and -- and for that matter 
now, I mean, did -- did your experience at all c
ontribute to a religious
 identity as a Jew? I 
mean ha-hav e you been  a devout person, are yo
u -- do you feel secular, wh-what™s your 
identification religiously, as opp
osed to culturally as a Jew? 
A: That™s a very interesting question, I -- I don™t think -- first of all,
 I don™t think I have 
ever been religious. My  brother got Bar Mitzva
hed in France and for a very short time, he 
actually became very religious. I mean, it was a ma tter of months, and -- and asked my  
mo ther to keep a kosher home, and wh en we got
 to the United States, 
he said ah, forget 
about all that nonsen se, you know, just -- 
Q: So you didn™t keep kosher? 

A: No. 
Q: And you -- 
A: My mother -- 

Q: -- did you have a Bas Mitzvah? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: My -- My  mo ther was very traditionally Jewish. I don™t think she was -- I don™t know, 

I don™t think she was really religious, but she -- you know, like she lit candles, I -- I think 
she maybe lit candles on Friday night, but I™m not
 sure she even did 
that very long. She 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
120 
 
 
 
would go to the Temple on the high holidays,
 and she would take me, my  brother would 
never come. I went along f -- I went to -- when  I was in early grades, I went to religious 
instruction on Wednesday afte
rnoons, at the local, little 
synagogue, across from my 
house. But I did that because I got out of sch
ool an hour early, but I 
think it wasn™t really 
that, it was the -- that every ki
d who went got a little 
bag of Planter™s peanuts. And I think 
-- I hate to say this, but I think I really
 went because of the Planter™s peanuts. 
Q: Bald-faced bribery, huh? 
A: Yes, bald-faced -- 

Q: I grew up Catholic, they had 
-- they had similar schemes for us. 
A: S-So -- So, yeah, well, Cat
holic, that™s an -- you know, th
at™s a whole other story. My 
daughter had a friend who woul
d come over here on Sundays 
and ask us if her mo ther 
called, to not say that she wasn™t in c
hurch , you know, to -- that she could -- 
Q: Oh yeah, yeah, that™s
 sounds very familiar. 
A: And I -- And I would always say, if you™re
 here, and your mo th er calls and says where 

you are, you™re here. I -- You know -- 

Q: Can™t do that. 
A: And -- And that™s one of the things that -- 
that -- see, my mother was very good about 
that. I -- I d id -- I did omit errors of omission. I knew sh e was very worried, and so 
sometimes I didn™t tell her abou
t places that I was going, or -- 
or if I did something that I 
thought she would th ink was dangerous, or if 
I expected to be home at midnight, I would 
tell her that I™d be home at one am. So I -- So 
I did fib in that way, but other than that, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
121 
 
 
 
was very honest with my  mo th
er, and I think she was very honest with me. And that was 
a big thing in our fam -- I me
an, we told our kids that there was only one major, you 
know, crime, and that was to not be honest. And that worked out ve
ry well, cause even -- 
I mean, we had a bad time with our daughter
™s teenage rebellion, but I remember her 
coming one day and saying, ﬁMa, I™m going to 
tell you something, a
nd I know you™re not 
going to like this, but I want you to know I™m 
going to  do this anyway, I™m going to  this,ﬂ 
she was going to  some, I don™t know, rock co
ncert or something. I™m -- You know, far 
away and driving with some kids or wh at
ever. ﬁI™m going, and a -- you can™t -- you 
know, you™re not going to stop me, I just want
 you to know that I™m going.ﬂ So -- So that 
was -- that work ed out well and -- and I think 
my mother, in contrast to a lot of other 
parents, I think my mother listened to what we
 said, at least most of
 the time. And I think 
-- You know, I go to  the supermarket and you 
see a kid in a shopping cart, and the kid™s 

talking to the parent, and what is the moth
er doing? The mo ther™s, you know, ﬁYeah, yes 
Jimmy, uh-huh, uh-h uh,ﬂ you know, and -- a
nd her head™s obviously in another place. 
And I think that™s really ba
d for kids. And even wh en Damon was like two years old, 
Sam and I said to him, well -- he asked -- he 
wanted to  do something and Sam and I said, 
ﬁWell, you may not do this for the following th re
e reasons.ﬂ And  he looked at us and he 
said, ﬁYeah, but what about,ﬂ 
and he mentioned something a
nd Sam and I looked at each 
other, and we looked  at him and we said, ﬁWe
ll, we hadn™t thought of that, that™s a good 
reason. Okay, you can do that.ﬂ And I -- I thi
nk th ere™s been a lot of that, you know, I 
mean, and I have a -- a little cartoon that I keep 
on the refrigerator a lot of the time, that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
122 
 
 
 
says, ﬁYou™ll have to excuse me, I haven™t 
had a chance to dirt
y up since my  parents 
cleaned.ﬂ And I -- I use that in my workshops
, you know, that childre
n are not necessarily 
-- their perspective is not nece
ssarily wrong. It may be different from yours, but it™s not 
necessarily wrong, an d you ought
 to listen to what they say.
 And I think I got that from 
those crazy, early beginnings of having to be 
fairly responsible, you know, at a very early 
age, and that my  mo ther did kind of 
listen to what we had to say, and -- 
Q: And do you -- do you all 
-- does your family now -- is your husband Jewish? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Is -- D-Do you keep high 
holidays now? Do you -- Do you 
consi -- consider yourself 
devout, I mean, just -- 

A: When I went to college, I had to -- th-the
re was a thing th at said, you know, religion, 
and I wrote none. Bu t now I usually write Je
wish, it™s just easier, but I -- you know, I 
don™t think I really -- I didn™t -- I think, 
because of what happen
ed during the war, I 
didn™t like af -- being affiliated. It™s not so
 much that I didn™t like being affiliated with 
being Jewish. I didn™t like affiliate -- be --

Beginning Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Liane Reif-Lehrer. This is tape number five, 
side A. You were talking about affiliation. 
A: I -- I didn™t and I still don™t like being aff
iliated with anything, because that™s how 
people say, you know, I hate the ABC™s or
 -- so, I didn™t like being affiliated with 
anything. When I got my first job after gradua
te school -- no, no, no. Well, first I™m -- I 
met my  husband and my  husband had co me fro
m a -- a -- quite a religious background, I 
mean his father was very religious. And in 
fact, when we got married, his father came 
over to me and said, you know
, ﬁWould -- Would you consider
 keeping a kosher home?ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁNo. Sorry, I -- I really can™t do that.ﬂ Not only that, but we got married at 
city hall and -- and his father was after us 
all the time. W e™d get these letters, ﬁYou™re 
living in  sin,ﬂ you know. ﬁWouldn™t you co
nsider getting remarried by a rabbi?ﬂ And -- 
And my husband said, ﬁYou know, why don™t we
 just do this to get the old man happy?ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁNo, I™m not going to do th at. Th
at™s -- That just totally goes against, you 
know, everything that I stand for. And finally
, his father was still writing and -- and some 
other friends of mine said, ﬁAh, you kn
ow,ﬂ So, on our th ird 
anniversary we got 
remarried at Harvard Hillel in
 Cambridge. And I think we ha
d two friends there and the 
rabbi said, you know, ﬁDo you M
r. Lehrer, take Mrs. Lehrer to be your lawful wedded 
wife?ﬂ And I never used the name Lehrer, wh
ich was funny, cause I always used my 
maiden name, until my husband 
had to have some surgery, 
and that™s when I started 
hyphenating it. And -- And then these two guys
 threw rice as we walked out of Hillel, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
124 
 
 
 
and so -- so we were remarried on our third an
niversary, by this rabbi, under a chuppah. 
You know what that is? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And -- You know, and -- an
d now I think, well, you know
, I don™t know. I probably  
shouldn™t have fussed about that
 so much, but I -- but I -- I 
f -- I didn™t feel good standing 
under that chuppah, I felt -- I felt like I wa
s going against me, a
nd -- and going through 
some bizarre action just to please somebody 
else who was not cons
idering my  feelings. 
And -- And that there was something -- I mean
, now I™m older, I go to other people™s 
weddings, you know, it™s fun se
eing th e ritual and -- and so on and so  forth, but when  
you™re standing there under it, it just -- it s
eemed -- it seemed hypocr
itical. It seemed as 
though I was participating in so
me kind of witchcraft. You know
, it -- it -- it ju st -- it just 
didn™t -- I mean, I remember standing under th at, and just n-not f-feeling right, you know. 
But, I mean, you know, now I™m 
older and I think, well I™m -- I™m really glad that I made 
this old guy happy, and you know, and so -- so
 big deal, so I was uncomfortable for 10 
minutes, or whatever it was. On the other hand
, I think this is the 
way people™s principles 
get -- get worn down as they age. You 
know, you -- you -- you 
stop -- you wo rry less 
about your principles and mo re about, well, y
ou know, so and so really wants me to do 
that, so okay. I mean th-th-there was another 
thing, I mean, that -- you know, adults in 
our society kiss each other, and -- and that -- I -- 
I was kind of s-struck 
that that™s sort of 
bizarre, because I -- I sort of
 grew up with the notion that
 you kiss somebody cause you 
really kind of like them a lot. And I kissed 
my  brother and I kissed my  mo ther, maybe I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
125 
 
 
 
kissed my dolls, I don™t n -- I™m n o t sure abou
t that. But this -- this
 woman who went to 
medical school with my  fathe
r, used to get very -- it™s a wo
rd I do -- I don™t use the word 
insult. I mean, I hardly ever 
use that word, occasionally, but
 hardly ever. She would get 
very insu lted, cause she would come to th
e house and she would think th at I should kiss 
her. And -- And I wouldn™t kiss her, and my  mo th
er would get angry, you know. ﬁWhat is 
this, what is it? Why do you -- It™s not hu
rting you. Give Marenka a kiss.ﬂ You know, she 
feels so bad that you™re not -- well -- and I wo
uldn™t do that, cause I still had principles, 
you know. I was eight years ol
d or nine, or 10 or whatev
er. And now -- I mean, now I™ve 
just given in . I mean, you go to  a meeting, yo
u meet somebody for the first time, and you 
blow this kiss, you know, you sort
 of put your cheek next to 
theirs, and you blow this kiss 
that goes off into the air someplace. But I me
an, that™s what everybody does, and I -- I -- I 
don™t really like -- I don™t really, particularly
 enjoy pe -- kissing peop
le that I don™t know, 
and sometimes I don™t even necessarily like 
that much, you know. 
So you kind of go 
through life and you make comp romises with 
your prin ciples, cause it just makes life 
easier than having an  argumen
t every time, about why won™t you kiss me  hello, or you 

won™t kiss me goodbye, or something like th
at. You know, I don™t want to have an 
argument, so it™s just easier 
t-to -- to do wh at 
the society tells you to do. And -- And I 
mean I think we dress, a lot of the times, not
 the way we feel like dressing, but the way 
society dictates. You know, it™s just easier.  
Q: Well, you know, I wanted to ask you one
 other thing, and it 
picks up a little bit on 
what you were just talk ing about. In 
ter -- In -- In -- And I™ve had -- What? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
126 
 
 
 
A: Oh, excuse me, I™m sorry. I -- I didn™t 
really finish answering your question. 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: I -- I -- I™m sorry. I -- I thi
nk I got off the track. After our
 children were born, I didn™t 
really want them to get Bat Mitzvahed 
or Bas Mitzvahed, but somehow -- and my  
husband is really, totally non-religious. You 
know, I mean he grew
 up in that very 
religious household and th en he
 kind of dropped the whole 
thing. And by the time I met 
him in Berkeley -- but in Be
rkeley he would, you know, he would make a seder at 
Passover, and we would -- and one time it was in
 my apartment with my room mates and 
everybody had a great laugh, because first of 
all, we were the only Jews at the seder. I 
mean, we l -- we had lived at Internationa
l House the year before, and you know, we 
knew one Indian  and one this and one that, and 
so we were practically
 the only Jews. And 
then I-I made -- I made something called cogo, I 
don™t know if you know 
what that is, it™s 
-- it™s egg noodles with raisins and appl
es and you bake it in the oven and 
[indecipherable], you know and -- and then  -- so
 I served that and somebody at the seder 
said, ﬁYou know, you™re not allowed to eat th
at on Passover.ﬂ Well, I 
mean, I hadn™t ever 
thought about it, noodles, you™re not supposed 
to eat noodles on -- well, I -- I don™t know. 
When  -- Wh en I was at my  mo ther™s house, 
I think I did fast on Yom Kippur, because, I 
don™t know, I think maybe she wanted me to. 
I don™t usually do th at. My husband didn™t 
for years. Every once in  awhile, he suddenl
y decides he™s going to do that. And our 
daughter went through a stage 
when she was maybe a little bit -- she started to have a 
tendency to be a little  
religious, or maybe not even religious, but just traditional. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
127 
 
 
 
think -- I think she is maybe a little bit resent
ful. She -- She says to me, she says, ﬁYou 
know, when I was in first gr
ade, the teacher asked every
body what religion they were, 
and when she got to me, I said
, I don™t know.ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁWhat do you mean you don™t 
know?ﬂ I said, you know, ﬁJust because we di
dn™t do a lot of those things,ﬂ I said, 
ﬁsurely, you mu st have known that youﬂ -- she 
said, ﬁNo, I was really confused. I didn™t 
know,ﬂ you know. So -- So anyw
ay, so -- so then, th e other part that came into this is -- 
so in grad uate school, I had met my  husband
 the first week, alth
ough we didn™t get 
married for four and a half years, after we fi
nished. And then I -- I 
-- I came here and I 
had my  first job. And th e guy I wo rked  with, who was my  immediate, I don™t know, 
senior person -- with whom I™m
 still in contact, by the way -- was from quite a traditional 
Jewish home. And he was actually married to
 a woman who had escaped Europe, she was 
from Berlin. And -- Excuse me, I™m going 
to let this [indecipherable] she™s -- 
Q: Oh, okay. 
A: So, he -- I don™t know how this came up,
 but you know, at lunchtime we would talk 
about things and he came -- one day we st
arted talking about religion and I -- I said, 
ﬁWell, you know, I me an, yeah, I™m of Jewish
 orig in, but,ﬂ I said
, ﬁI -- you know, that 
doesn ™t matter.ﬂ And he looked at me, he sa
id, ﬁWhat are you talking about, that doesn™t 
matter?ﬂ He said, ﬁThat matters a lot.ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁDo you think, th at as a woman, you 
would have gone to gr
aduate school, if you weren™t Je
wish?ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell,ﬂ you 
know, ﬁthere are a lot o f WA
SP -y women out there who -- wh
o do big important things.ﬂ 
And he said, ﬁWell, yes, but they™re not a lo t and that actually, one of the things that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
128 
 
 
 
comes down to you, about being Jewish, is that 
there is, in the Jewish
 tradition, as in the 
Chinese tradition, there is a tr
adition of education. And you -- you got a lot of that, and 
that™s probably why you™re sitting here today and we™re talking about chemistry. And, 
you know, probably , if you were reared in
 some other religion,
 unless you happened to 
come from a particular kind of home, or 
something, you probab
ly  would never have 
gotten this educated.ﬂ I™m not 
sure to what extent that™s 
true, but in just doing a little 
reading, and in the years that
 followed that, I guess I sort of
 became convinced that the 

likelihood of my  getting a Ph .D., as -- especi
ally as a woman, was probably increased 

because there was this tradition 
of things passed down through 
the ages. You got to go to 
school, you got to do well, you got to get A™s,
 you know, and so  on and so forth. And so 
now, if somebody -- depending on who it is, I™ll 
usually just say, ﬁWell, I™m of Jewish 
background,ﬂ or -- or something like that, or 
occasionally I™ll still say, ﬁWell, I™m -- I™m 
just not a religious person.ﬂ However, somethi
ng that feeds back in
to what we™ve been 
talking ab out all day, is h -- this house has wi -- a lot of windows, and so me of the 

down stairs rooms, you could wa
lk right up to the window a
nd you can read wh at™s on the 
desk. And my  husband laughs about this so
metimes, but I -- I would never leave, on a 
desk in a down stairs room, knowingly, anythi
ng that would iden tify us as being Jewish. 

Not because I™m ashamed of it, but because it 
scares me. And I know that there are a lot 
of people out there, who for whatever bizarre
 reason, don™t like Jews. And as I™ve gone 

through life and looked around me, you know, a
nd people keep poin ting th ings out to me, 
I think, you know, it really is kind of bizarre
, because Harvard Un iversity, who used to ex  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
129 
 
 
 
-- which used to exclude Je
ws on the faculty, is now 
30 percent Jewish faculty, 
apparently . And -- You know, and I -- I l
ook around -- I mean, when  I read the 
newspaper and I read th at somebody did so me
thing, you know, th at™s sort of in the 
educational or inventing or something realm, 
it™s almo st always either a Jew, or a high 
class WASP. I mean, there are obviously ex ceptions, you know, but -- so I think you 
know that -- it is funny -- it™s funny that th
ere is so much prejudice against the Jews, 
because actually, more or less, 
I think they™ve done good thin
gs. And the other thing that 
somebody pointed out to me many years ag
o is -- although th ere™s c-certainly been 
exceptions in recent years, is that there™s -- until very recen
tly, there is relatively very 
little violence in -- in Jewish families. I mean
 there was a famous case, I don™t know, 10 
years ago, about some Jewi
sh guy who mu rdered somebod
y or beat her up or -- or 
something, but I -- I think by
 and large -- and also, I don™t -- I think, traditionally, Jews 
drink a lot of Manischewitz wine, but they  
don™t get drunk. So -- 
So, you know, why is 
everybody down on the Jews? I -- I mean, I 
d on™t -- I don™t know. But -- But I -- I mean, 
I™m no longer -- but I™m not -- I™m not -- I™m ju
st not a religious person, you know? But I 
-- I -- I am no longer, sort of, as anxiou
s to get away from that. I mean, I don™t 
particularly like to advertise it,
 although, in very recent year
s, I think there have been one 
or two occasions when somebody 
has said something that got 
under my skin, when I have 

actually, in a very mild sort of way, flaunted
 it. Not -- Not really, 
but just sort of, you 
know, made a point of -- you know, somebody 
making a crack -- although, it has to be 
something that™s very important to me. I me
an, like one night, my  husb and and I were at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
130 
 
 
 
a dance, formal dance, you kn
ow, black tie and tails. So we™re
 standing next to this very 
tall guy, and we sit down at the table, and I ha
d actually danced  with  him, I kind of came 
up to  his belly button. And he starts going
 on and on ab out, ﬁW
ell, you know, all the 
troubles in the world are caused by thes
e damn  Jews,ﬂ you kn
ow, and -- and Sam™s 
kicking me under the table, and I™m, you 
know, and Sam was about to say something 
like, ﬁWell, you know, we™re Jewish,ﬂ or 
something. And I™m kicking, ﬁShut up,ﬂ you 
know, ﬁhe doesn ™t have to know.ﬂ And, so
 Sam didn™t say anything. But, you know, I 
don™t know whether I did the right thing or
 the wrong thing. I mean, could I have 
educated that person on that day, by saying
, ﬁWell, you know, we™re Jewish and you just 
danced  with  me.ﬂ But, you kno
w, I mean, this guy was like 70
 years old. I didn™t think it 
was worth it. 
Q: But still disturbing. Very disturbing. 

A: Right. Bu t I mean -- But so -- so basica
lly, sometimes I f -- you kn
ow, the al -- I feel 
the only hope for the world is
 total uniformity. There can™
t be different cultures, 
languages, religions. Everybody has got to
 be neutral, cause otherwise, somebody™s 
always going to  hate somebody else. On the ot
her hand, I realize that that would make the 
world somehow, a pretty boring place. 

Q: What about something with mutual
 respect for difference, I mean -- 
A: Yeah, but there isn™t -- there -- 

Q: Well, that™s -- yeah, that™s -- 
A: It doesn™t happen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
131 
 
 
 
Q: It™s not happening. 
A: You know? It™s not happening. And, I 
mean, like what™s going
 on in Yugoslavia? 
They -- They all come
 from this same tiny, little place
 on the globe, they™re more like 
each other than -- you know, than
 any of these nations that 
are fast friends, and they™re 
fighting each other. It™s totally ridiculous. So
, I don™t -- I mean, I -- I don™t -- I don™t want 
to be religious, I don™t want to be a ba -- yo
u know, now we go to a seder every year, we 
get invited to one. I don™t -- You know, it™s 
all right, it™s fun, good
 company, etcetera, 
etcetera. I don™t really want to be -- I don™t want 
to be forced to do th
at. I -- I -- Left to 
my  own devices, I don™t think I would do thos
e things. On th e other hand, when  I think 
about my way of getting peace in the world, of
 just wiping out any of these differences, I 
feel a little sad, and I think, you know, as 
long as they don™t do 
bad things, I don™t mind 
that some people like getting Bar Mitzvahed and 
some people do this and some people do 
that. It™s -- It™s kind of fun. It -- It™s colorfu
l. The things that bothe
r me slightly more are 
when I -- for example, my c
ousin Hilda, who -- who lives 
in upstate New York, she and 
her husband are -- have always been very religi
ous. They will not eat 
in our house, except 
on paper plates, and -- and so 
on. And -- You know, and when I was a kid, I remember 
being invited to her house for 
lunch one day, on a Saturday 
and I -- I asked her if she had 
a pickle. First of all, she made me -- I 
was eating something different from everybody 
else, so she made me eat it on a wooden  board.
 And th en I asked if -- if I could have a 
sour pick le -- no, she asked me, ﬁDo you want
 anything else?ﬂ And I said, ﬁI™d  like to 
have a pickle.ﬂ And she said, ﬁWell, go to 
the refrigerator and -- and get a pickle.ﬂ And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
132 
 
 
 
so I went to her refrigerator and the light didn™t go on, wh ich I knew it usually did. And I 
stupidly didn™t think ab out it, and I said, ﬁYou 
know your -- the light in your refrigerator 
is burned out.ﬂ And she said to me, very sa
rcastically, ﬁIt™s Shabbat, the light in my 
refrigerator is not burned out. I l
oosen the bulb on Friday s.ﬂ And -- 

Q: Did she turn off 
the refrigerator, too? 
A: No. That™s an inte
resting -- That™s -- 
Q: So sh e -- 

A: I know. Tha -- Well, that™s -- 

Q: She says [indecipherable] comp
romise [indecipherable] there. 
A: Right. But, you know, and I thought, well 
isn™t this stupid. Wh en you open  the door, 

you don™t have to do anything, you know. I me
an, I can see where in -- in 5000 B.C., they 
had to make lights by, you kn
ow, collecting logs and scratc
hing two sticks together and 
so on. Why -- Why is she doing that? Well 
then, when I got ol
der, I realized it™s 
symbolic, it doesn™t really have anything to  do
 with the fact that turning the lights on is 
no work in, you know, wh
atever that year was. But I fi
nd that a little extreme and it -- I 
mean, I th -- I -- you know, I™m very -- that™s
 fine, you want to 
do that, that™s -- you 
know, go ahead and do 
that, and I -- I fully will, you know
, go along with your right to do 
that. But it seems a little funny and extreme that
, you know to  do things like that in 1999, 
you know. You don™t want to ea
t milk and meat together, that™s fine, but you know, you -

- I put my dishes through the dishwasher an d they™re not clean enough to go from one to 
the other? It seems a little funny and extr
eme to me. You know, 
I-I -- I somehow feel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
133 
 
 
 
people should be scie
ntific and logical to some extent
. You know, not entirely necessarily 
-- I -- you know, you can have your little foibles, 
but I guess -- I ge -- I mean, that bothers 
me, it doesn™t bother me only about Judais
m, it bothers me about
 every religion. You 
know, there are the charming parts of every relig
ion, and then there are the dodo parts of 
re -- for example, you say you™re Catholic. We
ll, you know, that™s -- I -- I spent a lot of 
my young years in -- in New Yo
rk, going to churches to lis
ten to the B minor mass, and 
all this good mu sic and so on, and I also onc
e made a terrible gaffe. I walked into this 
church  and I saw all these things, and I though
t, ﬁOh, that™s really nice, they have all 
these footstools,ﬂ and put my  
feet on one of these things, 
and then somebody told me 
those are not footstools. 

Q: [indecipherable] to kneel on. 

A: Right. So -- You know, so that™s all ve
ry charming and so on
, but then there are 

things, for example, I don™t know, I hope I™m
 not stepping on your feet, but you don™t 
practice birth contro l. You know, I mean that
™s -- we got too many 
people already, you 
know, and -- and -- and also this 
comes into my thing about, I 
don™t thing any 
child that is 
not really, desperately wanted, should be bor
n into th is world. And I would -- Do you 
know, I was really bothered, for a long time, that I was an accident, because there™s this 

large age difference. And it wasn™t until I was 
40 years old that I one
 day sat down with 
my brother, and I said, ﬁI need to know wh
ether I was an accident.ﬂ And he said, ﬁNo, 
you were very much wanted.ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁWell, why didn™t th
ey have us closer 
together?ﬂ And my  brother said, ﬁWell, beca
use of the depression.ﬂ And my  response 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
134 
 
 
 
was, ﬁOh, great. So they waited for the depressi
on to be over, and th en they had me at the 
-- at the doorstep of World War Two. Well, th
at was pretty smart.ﬂ 
So -- You know, but -
- but the relief that I f -- I -- that I felt that
 night, knowing that I was planned, you know, 
and wanted -- you know, an-and sometimes fr
iends say to me, ﬁOh, oh,ﬂ you know like 
one friend of ours got 
pregnant, and sh e said, ﬁWell, you 
know, we really hadn™t planned 
to have a child for a couple
 of years, but I got pregnant, there was a hole in my  
diaphragm, so we figured, well, now™s as 
good a time as any.ﬂ That™s horrifying to  me. 
That is -- you know, I mean, I -- I kid people 
and, you know, I mean you can™t plan that 
well, but both of our kids were wanted and 
planned and I tell people,
 ﬁBoth of our kids 
were born on su mmer weekend da
ys, because I couldn™t take
 the time off from work,ﬂ 
you know. So, I don™t know, religions have th
eir good things and their bad things and I 
realize that some people don™t do well withou
t religion, and I think 
those people need to 
have it. But I don™t think it should be impos
ed on people who -- who are good people 
without it, and who don™t need it. 
Q: Mm-hm. I™m going to -- I want to ask 
you one mo re question, but I™m going to -- 
A: Okay . 
Q: -- flip sides here first. 
End of Tape Five, Side A 
Beginning Tape Five, Side B 
Q: And the -- the last thing I 
wanted to just ask you was, 
mi -- picking up a little bit on 
what we™ve just been talki
ng ab out, when you -- when you 
look back at -- an-and think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
135 
 
 
 
and reflect on -- on the meaning of what y
ou™ve gone th rough, and -- and the -- and the 
meaning of the Holocaust, I wonde
r -- well, I-I wanted to invite  -- invite you to reflect on 
that, but I want to ask you one specific thi
ng about it. I™ve done a numb er of these 
interviews, and talked  to people about whether 
they see this as a -- p rimarily as a -- as a 

tragic, horrible, unfathomable event in Jewish 
history, or -- or i-in human history, or 

both? I m -- To -- To be a little more specifi
c, I have a close friend who™s a photographer 
of Armenian background, and 
he has, in his own memo ry, his grandparents memo ry, the -
- the Armenian genocide of 1915. 

A: What™s that guy™s name? Cause I know a photographer. 
Q: Newbar Aliezanian. 
A: Oh, no. 

Q: No, he™s in Gloucester, where I live. 

A: Okay . 
Q: And Newbar recently -- There™
s a film maker, Arel Morris, th
at -- that Newbar went to 
shoot some stills for a 
-- for a film, that he made, partly  in Birkenau, and Auschwitz. And 
-- And Newbar of cour -- you know, spent lik
e 10 days there, and 
of course was, you 
know, tremendously affected by it. And, you k
now, his understanding is, this is t -- what 
this says to him, is what human beings have
 been capable of doin
g to each other. And of 
course, many Jews would experience this as 
so meth in g  mu ch  mo re sp
ecific to -- to what 
was directed at Jews. And -- And I guess I want
ed to ask you in ter -- I don™t know if you

think about it in these terms, in
 terms of the lessons, is it --
 is it a lesson primarily for 
Jews, or for humanity, or -- or do 
you not think of it in that way? 
A: Oh, I very much think of 
it that way. I think -- lesson. I don™t think it™s a lesson, 
because I don™t think we™ve lear
ned anything. I think -- I c -- I find it very hard to believe 
that it™s not going to  happen again. I mean, like
 right now, when I turn on the radio, and I 
hear, ﬁWell, you know, the Russians are kind of
 siding with the Yugo
slavs, and China is 
getting a little alienated,ﬂ and so  on. And i
mmediately, in my head, I see the map 
switching into the scenario fo
r World War Three. Because -- 
I mean, I hope that nothing 
like that will ever happen again, and -- but 
-- but I don™t have faith that it will never 
happen again. And I -- I think -- Well, I think 
of the Holocaust, as 
what the hell did they 
pick on the Jews for? I mean, 
the Jews are -- y ou know, as I said a minute ago, I mean, of 
all the pe -- if -- you know, if I were a bad guy,
 and I wanted to pick a group of people to 
pick on, it would not be the Jews, because, you know, by and large, they™re mo re or less 
law abiding, they don™t drink.
 They™re -- They have a reasona
ble family life, and by and 
large, they™re educationally oriented, and 
th ey  kind of do good th ings, you know. If I 
were going to wipe somebody ou
t, I would -- I would find groups that do bad things, to 
wipe out. You know, people who -- who -- who 
are very warring, or 
you know, or self-
destructive, or destructive of other peop
le, or -- I -- I™ll tell y -- I™m g o ing to say 
something which is a horrible thing to  say. 
And I don™t -- I mean, I don™t really mean it 
the way it sounds, but it™s a thought that has 
often crossed my  mind. I thought, you know, 
if Hitler had to get even with 
so mebody, and he had to sort of
 wipe out a group of people, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
137 
 
 
 
why did he pick on the Jews? Why didn™t he ju
st decide that he was going to  clean up the 
earth of all the people who do bad things? 
You know, go out and kill all the people who 
do bad th ings. 
Q: Wh-What does that mean? 

A: I don™t know what that mean
s, I™m just telling you this is
 a thought that I™ve often had. 
You know, that if he had to have this crazy passion, to go and -- and do -- you know, now 
they call it, or th-they ca -- they call it ethnic 
cleansing. Why didn™t he, instead of ethnic, 
which makes no sense, why didn™t he do so me ot
her kind of cleansi
ng? You know, get rid 
of -- of people who -- who mu rder other pe
ople, who -- who go out and, I don™t know, 
steal, who -- I mean, you know, I -- I -- I don™t
 know, but why -- why didn™t he get some 
sense -- so me -- some more sensible agenda
? I mean, why did he pick on th is random 
group of people, who undoubted ly have a lot 
of bad folks in them, but, you know, by and 
large, they™re a -- a reasonably okay group.
 You know, why didn™t
 he decide he was 
going to  do in everybody who was in the jail
s? You know, or -- or sometimes I hear it 
costs, you know, I don™t know, 
x thousands of dollars to ke
ep  somebody on death row. 
Well, I™ve changed my  mind about that, b
ecause as I™ve gotten older, it suddenly has 
occurred to me, you know, there are people on 
death ro w who really aren™t guilty. But -- 
You know, so why didn™t Hitler make a projec
t of finding out, you know, who -- like who 
was really guilty, and if somebody really did 
something bad, you know, make a project of 
getting rid of all those pe -- you know, or so
mething more sensible, something -- I mean 
that -- you know, tha -- tha -- it™
s a very childish statement th
at I™ve just made. But -- But

I -- You know, and I -- I don™t think th e Ho locaust 
affected only the Jews
. First of all, lots 
of other people, you know, G
ypsies, [indecipherable] a lot 
of other people got killed. 
Q: Gays, and handicapped. 

A: Right, right. But -- But I think -- I think 
-- I think th e whole wo rld, or a lot of the 
whole world was affected, and I think the Ge
rmans were not the least of them, because 
first of all, the good Germans, are often liv
ing some kind of horrible guilt trip. I mean, I 
don™t think I have ever yet me
t a G erman who didn™t tell me 
that they hid Jews in their 
house, during th e wars. And I™ve calculated that
 if every German who 
told me that they 
hid a Jewish family in their house, really 
had done that, there wo
uldn™t have been any 
Holo caust, you know? So that mu st be a terribl
e thing to have to liv
e with. And the other 
thing was something that actua
lly happened to me. I was inv
ited to give a talk at some 
library in Brookline, some y
ears ago, which didn™t wo rk very
 well, because I cracked up 
in the middle of my own talk, and started cr
ying, and then I ooof. But anyway, at the end 
of the talk, there was a long 
line of people waiting to talkto me. And so, you know, most 
of them just said something nice and left. Bu
t there were two people, standing one behind 
the other. The first one was a very elderly 
Jewish man, who bawled me out for saying 
that there are good Germans. And right after 
him, there was a very young, very blonde, 
German woman, who was probably in her 20™s,
 who came to thank me for understanding 
that not all Germans are bad. So that 
was -- that was a kind of a heavy mo ment. 
Q: I™ll say.

A: And I think -- Aw , you know, 
there is something else that I -- th at I -- I don™t think I 
mentioned this on the other interv
iew, and I think this is maybe an important issue. I told 
you earlier that I had sort of, in a very casual way, decided I wanted 
to go back to all the 
places that I had been in my 
childhood. In 1961 - ™62 -- ™61 
- ™62? No, ™63, s -- 1962 - 
™63, my husband and I took that
 year off, and my mo
ther took a trip to Israel, an d we met 
in Vienna, because I specifically
 routed that we would go to -- to see where I was born. 
And we had lived in  these -- we had these 
two ap artments, and they  had knocked down  

the wall between them, so my father™s practic
e was on the right hand side, and our living 
quarters were on the other side. And, so I 
knocked -- I was with my  husband, and my  
mo ther met us in Vienna, she came from Isra
el. I knocked on the door of the left hand 
apartment, cause the wall had been re-put 
up there, to -- to make it back into two 
apartments. There was no answer. And then 
the mo st unbelievable thing happened. I 
knocked on the door of the right hand ap artmen
t. My husband was standing sort of right 
beside me, and then , my  mo ther was here, next
 -- sort of next to -- to him. The door 
opened, th ere was a woman who opened th e doo
r. She looked at us, 
she looked at my 
mother, and she turned 
absolutely snow white, and start e
d apologizing. I couldn™t believe 
this scene. We left in 1930
, in -- in May of 1939. This 
was now 1963, spring of 1963. 
This wo man recognized  my  mo ther, and she started apologizing, ﬁIt™s not my  fault that I 
have some of your fu rniture, the landlord to
ld  me to keep it. What happened isn™t my  
fault.ﬂ You know, and she -- she was just con
tinuously verbalizing -- 
this was in German. 
And I said to her, ﬁAll I want to do is, I want 
to come in for 10 minu
tes, and look around 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
140 
 
 
 
to see where I grew up. You™re welcome to th
e furniture, I™m not coming to take anything 
away. There™s nothing to wo rry about.ﬂ This 
lady followed us all around her apartment, 
and [indecipherable], you know, 
ﬁIt™s not my fault,ﬂ you know, ﬁthe superintendent told 
me wa,ﬂ -- you know, ﬁnot my  
fault, not my fault.ﬂ Well, th
at lady probably did not -- has 
not had a very good life either. I mean, I 
don™t know how often this conscience thing 
came up, maybe it never came  up except this 
time, but I mean, can you imagine this -- 
this scene. So, I went in, wa
lked into the apartm
ent, recognized th e green and sort of 
beige-y streaked linoleum from my father™s 
office, you know, wh ere my  father™s dental 
chair had been. And there was a funny -- unde
r the linoleum, you could see a round hole, 
was about this big, that had been covered ov
er, and I thought, that
™s where my father™s 
examining chair must have been
. And I still think that™s prob
ably what it was, but when 
we got finished looking around, and we left
, and said thank you 
and goodbye, and this 
woman was like a nervous wreck, and my  
mo th er was -- my  mo
ther was a nervous 
wreck, and I -- I really felt very bad, afterwar
ds, that we had taken her there, because I 
thought, you know, she didn™t 
need this. We came outside 
the building, and there was a 
plaque on the outside of the 
apartment house that said that
 a bomb had fallen through this 
house, but it had not exploded. And so then  
I started to wonder, afterwards, you know, 

was that really -- did I remember
 correctly that that™s where my
 father™s chair w as, or was 
that where the bomb fell? And I don™t -- I don™
t know what the answer is. In 19 -- I don™t 
know, maybe the early 1990™s or something,
 my  husband and I went back to Vienna 
again, just the two of us, and I went back to
 that house again, and this time the build ing

141 
 
 
 
looked like absolute 
slum, it was just awful. And I went upstairs and I-I -- I rang the 
bells, nobody an swered, and my  husband said, 
ﬁDo you really need to do this again?ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ  An d we walked into a fa
bric shop ju st a couple of doors down, and 
started talking to the woman, 
and told her why we were here
, and we went for a ride in 
the riesenha -- you know what th
e Riesenhardt is, in Vienna? 
Q: Never been there. 
A: It™s a -- It™s a ride, it™s -- it™s like a 
Ferris wheel, except it™
s got closed cars, and 
they™re really rather enormous, 
I mean, a lot of people fit in 
them. So we -- we went for a 
ride on that, and -- but anyway, that was -- th at
 was -- th at was a -- quite a bizarre thing. 
And then, I don™t know, I someti
mes think I™d like to go back
 again, but I don™t think I 
would go back to the house again. 
Q: Mm-hm, yeah. Once is  probably -- 

A: We did go -- We went to my  -- We went to
 my  father™s cemetery that second time, and 
-- to see his gravestone. 

Q: How was that? 

A: It -- It™s tilted, but it look
s brand new. When my mother was alive, she sent money 
every year to up -- to keep 
up the grave, and th
en when  she died, I thought, ﬁAw,ﬂ you 
know, ﬁI™m not going to  do that.ﬂ So it™s -- 
you know, it™s not nicely kept up, but it -- but 
the stone is still there, and it lo
oks -- I took some pictures of it, it -- it -- it™s tilted, as I 
said, but it -- it really looks like new and it™
s funny, funny -- not fu
nny-fu nny, but I don™t 
know, just weird, going to this place.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043  
142 
 
 
 
Q: Yeah. Well, I really thank you
 so much for taking
 so much time to -- 
to talk about this. 
Are there any other last thoughts that you 
have, that you want to share? I think we™ve 
gone thro ugh sa -- 
A: Probably not til after you leave [phone ri
nging]. Excuse me for ju
st a minute. I™d like 
to ask, is --
