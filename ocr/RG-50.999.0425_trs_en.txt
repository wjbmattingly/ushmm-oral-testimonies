Jacqueline, thank you for joining us andfor your wil lingness to 
be our First Person today.  Really great tohave you here.
  
Youhaveso much to tell us in such 
a shortperiod. W e'll cover as m uch as we can.  AndI'm  going to get us started rightaway.
 
Le
t's start with you telling us a little about your fam ily in your own early years before the 
Anschluss in 1938.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My parents decided it was very dangerous. W e left. I rem em ber 

leaving Paris and com ing back. That was our f irst leave of our home in Paris.  Then in 1939, 
declaration of war, m y parents decided it was dangerous again. Sowe left Paris. W edidn't 
stay ver y long.  Nothing was happening. That was the phony war.  So we went back to Paris.

I remember those.
 
>> B ill B e
nson:  I'm  going
 
to
 
take you back tothose early years a little bit.T ell us 
--
 
your 
parents, tellus about their nationality. T heywere not French. W ere they?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  No.  My parents were not French, never became French.  My 
fa the r
 
was Dutch.  Hisfam ily had been Dutchfor centuries.  My m other was f rom  Hamburg, 
Germ any, where they had beenfor centuriesalso.  And when m y motherm arried m yf ather, 

she becam e Dutch.  So actually even though I was born inParis, Iwas Dutch.  I was a
 
D ut c h  
Jew, a foreign Jew in Paris.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Even though born there.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. I didn't know that until afew year s ago that actually I was 

not born French.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did you have a large, extendedfam ily?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. But not on m y mother's side. She was anonly child. My 
grandm other 
--
 
well, I'll tell you later, whodied in ahorrible way.  And m y grandf ather had died 
quite a long tim eago.  My grandm other hada brother, was able to escape.  But there was 

hardly anybody 
--
 
his children were in the transport and survi vedW orldW ar II.
 
 
On m yf ather's side, on the other hand, he grew up in a very 
large f am ily.  He hadm any cousins.  I don'tknow what I can tell you now.  In ourextended 
f a m ily w
e have over 200 members of our Dutchf am ily that were murdered, murdered, gassed, 
who knows? W edon't have the exact detail,although we know it was Auschwit z.  T hat was 

m y grandm other.  And other places.

>> Bill Benson:  Jacqueline,during that pre
-
wa r t i
m e, your father's business, he was having 
som e diff iculties.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Bef ore the war there was a greatdepression just like in the U.S.  
It cam e later in France, but it was d
if f icu lt
 
earn a living.  I never noticed because I know we eat 
a lotof  pasta, because that was available.  But thenaf ter the war started, very quickl y there 

were la ws established.  The Jews were notallowed to own abusiness.  So myf ather had to 
sell his shares
 
f or af ew f rancs to his associate who was a very good man,actually.  I will t ell 
you that later. But m y father was not allowedto work.  All businesswhere Aryani zed.  So 

doctors, dentists, pharm acists, teachers, government employees, ever y Je wish person had 
hadto leave their job.  And to earna living wa s im possible. It was very diff icult. I don't know to 
this day how m y parents m anaged.  I know thatm y f atherprobably by bic ycle because there 
was no m ore oiling inFrance. Probably took his bicycle to go to his office.  I know he toldus 
later he was hiding in the back of the officebecause if  som ebody rang thebell, as a Jew and 
because of hisID card, he would have beenarrested immediately.
 
>> Bill Benson: T his is the backof  what washis own bus
iness.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Am  I right that atone point yourf am ily consideredthe possib
ilit y of c on vertin g 

to  C
a th o lic is m ?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.  My parents had wonderf ulf riends.  And actually, the lady, I 

re m
em ber, hernam ewas Genevieve, tried to convert us.  It wouldn't have helped really 
because they were born Jews andthey were Jews.  T he conversionwould not helpat all.But 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

thatfam ily was absolutely wonderf ul to us.  And when wef inally f led, we spent 
the last night 
with them .T hey burned our Jewish star, theyello w Je wish star.  And they gave us
,  
m y m other 
and sister andm e
,  
a Catholicm edal. That's very f am ousf or Catholic people. Maybe there are 
som e Catholics am ong you.  T hat'sf rom  a little town
 
in the south ofFrance called Lourdes 
where there
 
were many m iracles since the 19th Century.  So she gave thatm edal, Genevieve 
gave that medal
.  A
ndI have m ine to this day.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You kept it.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. I don't know where I was wearin g it when we crossed the 
demarcation line, but m aybe it saved us.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jacqueline,W orldW ar II began. Afew m onths earlier, I think, Marchof 1939, 

your parents were able to declare youand your sisters French citizens.  W hy w
a s  t ha t  s o 
s ign if ic a n t?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My m other, well, probably bothm y parentsfelt thatas French 
citizens, she would have a better hopeof  survi val because theoccupation forces and alsothe 
French police, unf ortunately, arrestedf oreign Jews f irst.  Butm y parentsdidn't realize thatwe 
were not French. T here was a request. 
I 
have apieceof paper athome that is on the wall 
where it says thatm y father requestedf orusto be French
, m
y sister and me. But it didn't 
happen.  So we were foreign Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And afew m onths after that, I think in July, your f ather's father, your 

grandfather, died. And your f ather was not able toattendthef uneral.  That must have been 
ju s t  re a lly 
--
 
f or f inancial reasons, I believe.

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah, no. Actually he was able.  But the restof thefamily f or 
f inancial reasons we didn't go. So we never attended m y grandf ather, m y paternal 
grandfather's.  Ialways say it's a blessing that he died in1939,because his wif e,m y 
gr
andm other 
--
 
[Inaudible]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter war broke out in Septem ber1939, you left Paris f ora second time,
 
returned again to Paris.  And in May 1940, of course, Germany invaded what was called the 
low lands, Holland, Luxem bourg, Belgium,f ollowed by France.  Youthenf led Paris, thefam ily 
f led Paris,f or a thirdtim e. T hey had returned toParis. W hydid your 
parents
 
leave each tim e 
andeach time go back to Paris?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My father say, 
ﬁ
I have toearna living.
ﬂ
  
B y th a t tim e
, 
he could 
still work in his com pany.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Even though he wasn't able to own it.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Right. T hat iswhat is called the exodus.  Andmillions of people 

f led and went South.  And m any of  them 
re
main in theSouthof  France. But m yf ather say, 
well, I have to work.  So we went back.
 
 
T hings were all right.  My fatherobeyed the law, registered at 
the local city hall.  Healways said we obey the law andthey will le ave us alone. But we 

couldn't go tothe local library and get books. W ecouldn't take swim m ing lessons. W e 
couldn't certainly go to a movie. W e were really staying at hom e.T here was ver y little f ood.
 
T hem erchants in our little neighborhood knew the Mandelsfam ily, andeven thoughm y 

m other was only allowed to shopf rom 4:00 to 6:00,they always lef t a little something so we

hadm ilk andbread and things.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you told usa mom ent ago, a little bit, on June 10, soonafter France was 
invaded, you were part of  thatexodusoutof Paris.  Do 
you 
re
m em ber that exodus?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a little. Literally tensof thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of  
people f leeing.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.  My father had the use of a littlevan, if you want.  I 

rem em ber m y sister and I sitting on thefoot stool in theback.  Idon't remember if  it was 
covered.  But eachof us, we had ourdoll.  And there ism y doll.  Shall I pull itout?
 
>> B ill B e n s
on:  Absolutely.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My sister had her doll that was given to us in 1940, and it 
survi ved up to this day.  That was thef irstexodus of the doll.  It'snot in very good shape, but 
it's there.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your doll was with
 
you through all the tim e and hiding?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  I will tell you later. T hat's m y doll. Itwas in ver y bad shape.  The 
arm s have beenm ended. This is m y granddaughter's littleoutf it when she was born.
 
 
W hen wef inally got our dolls in
 
our hiding place, aneighbor 
upstairs sent some things, including the dolls because we didn't have themfor thedem arcation 
line, of course.  Ihad som e clothes. And then m y father soldthe clothes
 
--
the baby.  And I 
cried.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ibet.  Jacqueline,at onepoint your parents considered trying to leavef ora

Dutch colony.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy a Dutch colony?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Becausem y parents were Dutch. T hey thought that the Queen 
of  Holland was going to help the Jews, the Dutch Jews in distress
, w
hich I found out through 
papers and archives that it would never have happened. And then the war was declared.  

T hen we couldn't leave the country.
 
 
My parents always sai d we're going to live together or
 
d i e 
together. Actually, just before the war brokeoutm y father wrote tooneof his cousins andsaid 
thathe was going to join the Dutchf reef orces that were in England by that time.  Hollandhad 
been occupied.  He was going to do that.  Hewrote tohis
 
cousin, I don't know how Ellen, his 
wif e, and the childrenwill m anage.W e would not have survi ved.
  
But then Francebeing 
occupied,m y father couldn'tescape. So westayed together.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he border was sealed.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  E
xa c t l y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you lef t on theexodus, of  course, you were in Paris when the Germans 

attacked. You were there I think, I think you rem ember being in a cell
a r.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah. W ehad gas m asks.
  
W e hadto go tothe cell
ar.  The 
sirens were ringing.  And oncethere were Germ ans right next to usbecause they were 
occupying the apartm ent upstairsf rom  us where thatfam ily hadf led already.  So they were  
also taking shelter.
  
And when they lif ted the alarm , if you want, we went back to our 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
apartm ent.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And part of lif ting thatalarmwas to say Paris was an open
 
city. W hat d id th a t 
m ean to say Paris is an open city? W hat didthatm ean?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat the French were notf ighting. And af ter the Arm y ceased, 
the French soldiers were disbanded.  Many of them  haddied.  But there was no Arm y.  And 
notonly Paris, but a lot of the cities in thenorth were declared opencities.
  
T here was a 
contingent that the French would keep100,000 soldiers in
 
the non
-
occupied zone, in the so
-
called non
-
occupied zone,as Ialways sa y.  They also saved our lives.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Explain tous a little bit about what it m eant, thisdem arcation line.  Youhave 

this northern part occupied by the Germ ans, but they 
didnotoccupy at that tim e the southern 
part. That was what they called Vichy. W hatdid that really m ean?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Letm etalk about som ething elsebefore that. W e were still in 
Paris. T hings were getting really, reall y badfor the
 
Jews.  And in 1941 they were roundingup 
actually ver y im portant people butdidn't have a job because you weren't allowed to have a job.  

But they roundedthem up and sent them toAuschwitz.  T hentherewas the terrible roundup.  
And we were in Paris. We
 
were registered. Andm y parents had Jewish 
I D™s
.  B u t the y m ust 
havef orgotten to ring our bellbecausetheydidn't comefor us.  
 
 
T
hey wanted to roundup 27,000 Jews in Paris.  But thanksto 
som e goodpolicem en, people were warned. T he police told them, don't sleep in your 

apartm ent tonight because there's going tobe something very bad happening.  So that'show 
close to 14,000 people, 4,000 children, were roundedupbut not 27,000.  And we were there.

W e we r e a t h om e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were known.  It was pure luck.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. W efledone week after. Theend of  July.  No, actually it 
was alm ost two weeks.  And the week af ter that they cam ef orus.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas 1942. That's when your f inal tim ef leeing Paris.  And as you just 

said, they actually cam e to your door. You learnedthat later, thefollowing week you were 
gone.
 
 
So now you're f leeing for that thirdandf inaltim e. W heredid 
you go?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My parents, thanks to that wonderfulf riend who gave us that, we 
slept there. My parents had their ID cards.W eslept there. W e took thef irst Metro in the 
m orning which was 6:00 in them orning. I don't know if  we traveled in the last compartm ent 
wh
ere the Jews were allowed to travel, the other com partm ents weweren't allowed.  SoIdon't 
know. W e got tothe train station.  And there's two young boys and thefamily, they were 

workin g in theundergr ound. T hey hadtakenm y parents'backpacks.  My parents were notthe 
kind of people walking around with a backpack. T hey had abackpack. T hat was their worl dly 
goods.  My sister and I had nothing.  It was summ er tim e.  Im aginem y parents had a sweater, 
m aybe a change of shoes. I don't know.
 
 
So we got to thetrain station heading southbecause m y parents 
knew that there were sm ugglers were going t o be waiting f or us atthatborderbetween 
occupied and non
-
occupied.  And thetwo young m en hadtaken the tickets.  My parents 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

retrieved those and the backpacks and we got on thetrain.  
 
 
It's som ething I rem ember very well, the train. W e were sitting 
there. Andm y f atherbecamef rantic.  He went down the corridor and said, what's going on?  
T he wom an at the endsaid, oh, they are rounding up Jews onthe othe
r side of  the track.  So 
that was quitea m iracle.  T hey m usthave had their quotaof  Jews thatm orning.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were able to leave.  Before you continue on, leading on the train, tellus 

about your parents'preparations to leave your place in
 
France.  Pretty rem arkable.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. Onef light up were the Germ ans.  German soldiers.  

Actually knocked at our door andI opened the door.  I was not supposedto.  But maybe I 
wasn't wearing m y Je wish star.  Nothing happened to 
m e.
 
 
One f light up f rom  that was the wonderful wom an whose 
husband had died in the 
F
i rs t  
W
or l d  
W
ar.  Soshe hated the Germ ans.  You can imagine. And 
she acceptedto keepm y parents'most important belongingsf rom  the apartment, wedding 

presents, silver th
in g
s
, oneanother.  And I guess ourdolls. Because ourdolls were there,too
, 
m
y sister and m ine. W e had our bicycles. W e were notallowed to ride bicycles, of  course.  
T hey were in the cell
ar
.  
 
My m other hada piano, a littlepiano. I don't know how i
t 
happened,but m yf ather and the wonderf ulneighbor took the pianodownstairs and put the 
piano in hisapartm ent, the neighborsm ust have beenaway.  Som ething was happening. No 
one said a word.  Andyou know, it was the law, it was an order, you m ust denounce Jews and 
you m ustdenouncepeople that help.

Novem ber 1941, Ibelieve, your m om  received a letterf rom  your grandmother.

s everybody 
knows.  It's ahistory.
 
>> Bill Benson:  18?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  18,000.  So m y grandmother was taken away f rom her 
apartm ent and was put in what is calleda hiddenhouse,a Jew house.  And shehad the little 
room . T errible conditions.  But she was able to write.  Somehow, there was m aybe 
censorship.  Butm y mother received mail.
 
 
Oneday, it was Nove m ber1941,m y m other got her letter saying 
thatm y grandmother couldn't live anym ore and she was comm itting suicide. She never used 
the word suicide, but she said, I can't.  And she saidf arewell.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Shemade it clear.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. I think itwas Novem ber 21. She took an overdose of  
sleeping pills. W e know thatf rom the crim inal police thatm y daughter and niece researched 
about 10 years ago,15 years ago
, 
that she took an overdose of  pills.  And strangely enough,

she was buried in a Jewish cem etery.  Sothey did those things.
  
But you can im agine the 
sh o ck.  
>> Bill Benson:  And you also shared with me som ething you wrote in your memoir. It's, quote, 
your grandm other's suicide probably triggered something inm y m other's mind.  Can you tell us 
what your m other thought aboutat thatpoint?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah. T hathappens later when we were in hiding.  I was so 

af raid of the Germ ans. I was terribly af raidof those people in unif orm .  You know the word 
Nazi didn't exist for us.  It was Germans.  My m other toldm eand m y sister 
--
 
that must have 
been when we were in hiding already.  She told me, don't be af raid if the Germans come.  I'll 

gi ve you a little pill, and you will die right a way and you will never su ffer.  And shetoldm y 
sister.  She toldm e. And the whole village knew that the Mendelsfamily was going to comm it 
suicide if  theGestapoby that tim e was com ing.
 
 
I told m y little f riend.  W hen I m entioned 
--
 
when we went back to 
t h e  villa ge
 
--
 
what you toldm e?  He rem em bered. T he strange thing 
--
 
m y sister andm e, we 
hadforgotten.  I think a psychologist would say that this is something that you erasef rom  your 

m em ory.  And after that I rem em bered it, of  course. 
 
But the village knew.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Speaking of the village, tell us 
--
 
you escaped again on the train. There was a 
close call. And now you're going andend upat Le Got.  Not quite yet.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W e gotoff the train. W e hadto change trains. Actually, m y 

sister fell.  Shehurt.  She said to thisday shecanfeel on 
--
 
you know, on thehard cement.  
Lucky she didn'thavea concussion.  She would have endedup in the hospital, and then

Jewish, it would have been the endof  us.
 
 
So
 
we changed trains.W e got toa littletown.  And the 
sm ugglers said that they couldn't takeus that night.  Idon't know why.  And two nights later we 
had an 
appointm ent 
ina cem etery, next to a tree,behind the churchof  that little village.  I 
r e m em be r
 
walking 10
-
kilom eters, about six m iles.  It was hot.  It was August 1
, 
1942.  Andwe 
got thereand we were m eeting them atm idnight.  And we started walking through the woods.  
I don't rem em ber. T here was grass, I think. But I could see the Germ ans.  T hey were on the 
right. W e were sortof  on the left. I could see thetips of their cigarettes. And m y m other wrote 
in our baby journal, m y father wrote, that there was a motorcycle com ing through.  But 
fortunately there were no dogs, because those dogs we
re trained to catch people.
 
 
At one tim e, one of the sm ugglers said, 
ﬁ
go down on your knees!  
Go down on the ground!
ﬂ
  
W hich we did. My sister at thattime said, " Ihave to gopee
-
p e e ."   I t 
soundsf unny, but if  they had heardus.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
Absolutely.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Andanotherthing.  I'm  wearing it today.  M y parents carried 

heavy gold ring.  I never wear it.  Butthis was 
--
 
there's a saying in French,and in English
,  
you 
sa y,  
ﬁY
our m oney or your life.
ﬂ
  
Andm y parents were optim istic.  Said we gi ve you gold, give 
us our lif e.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: T hatwas intended
 
to be your wa y out if  you should get apprehended.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Idon't think itwould have happened.  Anywa y, one of the 
sm ugglers got ahead.He was supposed to signal to us that everything was clear.  Andthe

otherone putm y sister and me on the bicycle.  Andm y parents were running behind.W egot 
to the endof  theplace.  It was the so
-
c a lle d 
--
 
I  a lwa ys sa y so
-
called f ree zone. T here was a 
French 
soldier.  He said 
--
 
it's am ilitary expre ssion, 
ﬁW
ho goes there?
ﬂ
  
And the French soldier 
tookus infor the night.
 
 
T he next m orning they say 
--
 
they took us to the town, a 
--
 
here 
you have the Governor's house, the state, and then youhave a city.
 
>> B i
ll Benson:  Counties and cities.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Something like that. W hat todo? T hey lef t us there. So they 
checked into ahotel.  But inhotel, you have to check, give your nam e.  And this was a war.  I 
suppose thehotel keeper knew that
 
we were  Jews.  My parents ID. Anywa y, a knock at the 
door. It was 8:00 p.m. My parents were arrested.T hey were taken to the police station.They 

were interrogated.  That's when they hadto say that they were of the Jewish race.  My father 
said he ha
d  4, 0 00
 
f rancs with him .  My m other said she has 4,000
 
f rancs on her. W edon't 
rem em ber if  we stayed in the hotelalone or if we went with them.  My f ather declared that he 

had 25,000
 
f rancs with af riend ineastern France.
 
 
Perhaps, I can't say probably,
 
perhaps that was the money f rom  
his f irm  that his good associate had kept f or him.  And perhaps that saved us.
 
 
My parents then were taken to" the perf ect Jew,"  them ain state 
headquarters. And m y parents were interrogated again. They were heldfor one 
m on t h
, t h
e 
whole m onthof  August.  W e stayed in the popular soup kitchen. I don't remem ber

NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes. They could sleep with us.  But they hadto report every 
day.  And they didn't know theirf ate. Because it was up to eachGovernor, if  you want,to 
either put theforeign Jews in a camp, in an internment cam p,or in that 
--
 
and that ledto the 
concentration cam p
 
--
 
or to let them loose and live in hiding, which is m iraculously
 
what 
happened to us.
 
 
T hey told us
 
--
 
it was late August orearly Septem ber
 
--
 
go and 
f ind a place where you can goand hide.  Butwe were under watch. Andthat's where we 
ended up inthat little village.  They accepted that.W e were in the two rooms upstairs inthat 
lit t le  villa ge  of  Le  G ot .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just so the audience understands, this is still what they called the unoccupied 

part of France.  So theGerm ans hadn't directly occupied it.  But nonetheless you had to be 
registered.  You were known.  Sothe authorities knew that you were a Jewishfam ily li vin g i n 
t h is  lit t le
 
villa ge .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hat's right. W e were under the watch all the way to Vichy.  

T hey could com e anyday.  But probably one
 
of  the things that saved us, we were theonly 
Jewish f am ily in that village.  There were Jews that were roundedup all around. But in that 

tiny village, 29 houses, we were theonly ones.  
 
 
But talking aboutunoccupied zone, you know, the Am ericans 
landed in Novem ber1942.  Hitler was furious. T hen occupy all of  France.
  
So we hadtwo and 
a half months of respite.  Hitler chose November 11, which is the day f orWorldW ar I.

no toilets.  My sister and I went to get the water outof thepum p, and m yfather devised a little

going to get the water,and we had to

therewas still a train going there.  
I  wa s so  sca red .  
But we crossed over the rails. W e brought back water.
  
There was an ancient stove.  My

a bath, if you want, one af ter the other

Actually, there were rabbits there. I rem em ber that m yf ather

m y parents were killing the rabbitstohavef ood.  So you have to skin the rabbit.  And I had 

never seena skinny rabbit
. A n d it wa s

I rem em ber that clearly.
 
 
Also,m y m other was cutting the wood so she couldheat up the 
ancient stove. And she said, you know, shehadtobe very caref ulbecause she was a

yeah.  Butall of  France was occupied. Thetrucks with the 
Germ ans were going by.
  
I was al ways a curi ous child.  Iopened the thing.  My m other,"G

person, and his wife, they knew us by ourf irst nam e.  Idon't know if they knew our lastnam e, 
Mendels
,  w
hich is a Jewish nam e.  My sister rem embers that we wer e supposed to say 
Frederick.  Manuela Frederick, Jacqueline Frederick.  I know thatmy sister carried a little 

pouch on her with thename of ourf am ily in Calif ornia and in New York.  And we both learn
ed 
thatby heart so in case m y parents were deportedand we stayed alive that we would know 
where to com municate to.
 
>> Bill Benson:  An address in Calif ornia andNew York?
 

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jacqueline, you would be inthis
 
villa ge for more than two years.  Tell us about 
it .
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My m other becam e pregnant. She didn't tell us until afew 

m onthsbefore. She had no pregnancy clothes.  She was wearing som e kindof a night gown.  
I remember going upthe

m y parents had those temporary travel perm its that I brought

An y
way, we were pushing m y m other up the hill.  Shehad to go, 
I d on 't kno w, to  the  den tist
,  
to the doctor. She managed.  Must have beennearthe end of the 
pregnancy.  My sister andI were pushing her. T hen she was supposed to give birth. T here 
was som e kind of am idwif e that was supposed to com e.  And theone nightthere was a

comm otion. My sister and I were sharing a bed. W eheard thenoise. T he neighbor who lived 
downstairs, a very nice wom an, said go back to sleep, go back to sleep.  My motherhad t
o be 
transported.  It was a breeched baby.  She was bleeding terribly.  T here was no way she could 

gi ve birth
 
right thereand then. She was transported toa clinic where the doctor, wonderful 
doctor, was treating the Germ ans on one side and thefarmers andm y m other, Jewish wom an, 

on theother side. And m y brother was born.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One ofthe things you know I'm  going toask you, becauseI lookf orward to 

asking you this, whenyour brother is born and your m other
 
--
 
I think shealm ost died during
 
the 
tim e. It was aterrible, diff icult tim e. Jacqueline, sisters, Manuela, and your brother is named 

Franklin.  W hy?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Because theonly hope of survival f or m y parents was, as you 

m ay guess, Franklin Roosevelt at that tim e.My parents said Franklin Roosevelt is going to 
save us.  And you know, in the summ er of 1943,a terrible, terrible tim e.  People were rounded 
up right and left. And even though we didn'thave a radio, you knew the news.  My parents 
knew, m y m other certainly knew, since her mother's suicide,that there were horrible things 
happening eastand they said, you know, theAm ericans are going to save us.  They were 
hoping that.  And that's wh y ever y Sunday m orning m y parents lif tedtheir glass, and they said 
--
 
I 
don't know wh y I'm crying so m uch today.
  
Itm eans, in French, until next Sunday. T hat's 
becausem y parents said let'sbealive another week.  Let's be alive anotherSunday.  So ever y 

Sunday they lif ted their glass.  I don't know what they had, water, something in their glass.  
And they were wishing for another week of  life.

>> Bill Benson:  He was very im portant to you.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes, he was. He was.  Certainly.  T he mayor saved our lives 
m any times.  He gotfalse papersfor m y parents. That card actually was to getf ood tickets.  It 
had to 
be stamped every three m onths.  My parents were not allowed to goto that town.  So it 
wa s  
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasa catch 22.  You're supposed to get it validated, but you're notallowed 

to go there.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Not allowed togo.  He

He had other things to do
.  H

false papers
f
or otherpeople, too.  He got false IDf orm y parents.  I donated them  to the

But the m ayor

wanted toput us in a

there were roundups

So
 
we didn't go.  Ithink m y sister and I weredisappointed. But what happened is the convent 
was raided later.
 
>> Bill Benson: W here you m ight have gone.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Exactly
.  
>> Bill Benson:  Jacqueline, you're inthis little village.  You're theonly Jews there.  Thefact 
that you're Jewish is known in that town.  Germ ansare everywhere.  It's now f ully occupied.  
W hy do 
you 
think youwere not denounced?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: T hosepeople in that area of France, they're strong republicans 

in the French sense of the word, which m eans they were not realists, they were not on the 
right.  T hey were f or the republic. T hey were thinking of a good governmentagain. And also
 
so many of  them  had lost a father, a husband, a son inW orldW arI. Let's notforget,1918, 
1940, you know, it's hardly a generation. 
 
 
And letm e tell you som ething else that happened.  My brother

I have a photo of m y brother.  His legs were like a pin.  Miraculously

1944.  Andm y parents heard about that.  My father shortly af ter said

I have to go back and 
see what's happening.

I don't know how hedid it.  He went in Novem ber

He walked.  Idon't know if  he tookhis bicycle.  I have no idea.  But he got to Paris. The

there was quite an ordeal.  Youm ight im agine if  you have seenmovies the trip took three 
days.  And now it takes threehours so we had to change trains I don't know how m any times.  
I don't know about m ybrother 
--
 
I know that som ebody gave m ilk f or m y brother atone change.  
 
 
And when we got to Paris 
--
 
[Inaudible]I'm  still in touch with their 
children. W eare very goodf riends.  I remember especially
 
the young one, who was m y age 
--
 
who is m y age.  Eventually we got back to our apartm ent.  My sister andI got four
-
year 
scholarship to a wonderf ul private school whose head was a hero in the underground.  So we 
would learn what we hadn't learned allof  those yea
rs .

>> Bill Benson:  So inParis, you're going to go to school. T hat's when you really tookup 
m usic with a passion.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Oh,m usic.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Say alittle abo
u t  i t.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yeah.  Of course m y parents were m iserable, especially af ter 
f inding that everybody was dead. But m y mother wantedus to continuethe music trend inour 
fam ily.  My sister started the violin.  And then 
--
 
and I started thepiano.  I was very bad at the 
piano.  I couldn't coordinatem y two hands.  I learned to read music,but I couldn'tplay.  Then 

m y m other said, how about the cello?
  
Ihad no idea.  So the violin teacher,m y m otherfound a 
teacher.  I was playing on a 3/4 size then.  I cam e home thatday.  And whenmy father cam e 

home, I said, listento that. I played open strings.  A, D,G, C. I said, isn't thatbeautif ul?  And 
that was m yf irst love.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you have continued that passion throughout the
 
rest of your life.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henI first met you, youhad believed and said 
--
 
you believed that 13 
m em bers of  your extended fam ily had not survi ved the Holocaust. Now you know it's over  
200. T ell usabout learning about such a dram atically diff erent number. T hat'sfairly recently 
that you learned that.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes.  My father started getting in touch with the Red Cross. He 

was so sure that theother members of thefam ily had survived because we had survived.  And 
then hef oundout hism other, sister, brother, their spouses, his cousins, everybody had

andthat they never knew.

>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: They just gave up.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Speaking of rebuilding.  Youwould eventually, of  course, com e tothe United 

States.  How did thathappen? I think Richardf igures in there somewhere.

He m et m e.  I didn't meet him .  He m et me.
 
>> T he rest is history.
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  And quite a history it is, Im ight add.W e're going to wrap up in just a couple of 
m inutes.
  
I think we have tim ef or a coupleof questionsf rom our audience,though.  I think just 
a cou
ple.
  
W e have m icrophones. If  youhave a question, please waitf or them ic to be handed 
to you.  I may repeat the question justtom ake sureeverybody in the room hears it, including 
Jacqueline. But Im ay nothave todothat. T ry to m ake the questions
 a s 
brief as you can.  
And Jacqueline will respond.
 
 
Anybody have a question?  
 
 
Yes, sir?  A boldfellow here.W ait until we get the m ic
, t
hat way 
we pick it up on the tape as well.
 
>> I was just curious
.  W
hen the allied f orces actually def eated Hitler, 
how was the reactionof  
your parents? W hat kind of mood did that set with thef am ily?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Idon't understand.
 
>>W henhefell out ofthe tree whenheheard the allied landed, how about when Hitler was

d ef ea t ed ?
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthe war was over.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn: W e were in Paris by that tim e in 1945.  And I know people were 
dancing in the streets.  It was a wonderf ul joy all over.  That's whenm y f atherthought thatthe 
fam ily in Holland would beableto rejoice al
s o.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I've wondered, Jacqueline, if even though Paris wa s liberated in August of 

1944 and you were able to sort of resum ea life there
, 
with the war continuing until the 
following late spring, early sum m erof  1945, if there wasf ear that the
 
Germans could return
, i
f 
there was an ongoingfear of  what if the tide shifts again.  I wondered about that.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  I couldn't answer that.  I was 10 years old. I was 9 years old 

when we went back.  Iwas interested in schooling.  I
 
never talkedabout the war years, by the 
wa y, never.  Never.  Until not 20 years ago. And I don't know about my parents.  All I know is 

they wanted to rebuild.  They wanted to lookforward.
 
 
T he peril was the reds, the Soviets.  Some ofm y parents'f rien
d s 
actually lef t Paris and m oved to Canada andtried to convincem y parents to 
m o ve
 
to Canada.   
My f atherhad a cousin in T el Aviv, what was Palestine. Butm y parentsdecided to stay in 

P a ri s .
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywanted to stay in France. T hey stayed.
 
 
Another question. One right here.
 
>> You were such a young child when allof  this happened. And I'd like to get an 

understanding of how it made sense to you why the Germ ans were doing what they were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
33
 
doing.  How did your parentsexplain what was happening?  Did youunderstand the level of 
danger?  
 
 
Do you understand what I'm  trying to get at?
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  Yes, I am .  I understand you. All I knew is that the Germ ans 
were bad people, and I was scared. T hat's about it.
 
 
W hen wef led, because it was summ erand vacation,m y sister 
andI were just soterribly happy. W e could go on vacation.  Itdidn't happen every year, you 
know.  Conditions were difficult.
  
And then everything went like aball rolling.  So we go to 
school, we have a little life there.  I guess we were 
--
 
you know, children were m uch more 
innocent inthose days.  There was no radio, television, or news, anything.  So we were not 
aware.  And m y parents were hiding all thetim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Com pletely protect
ed
 
you 
i
n that
 
regard.
 
 
W ehave timef oronem ore, maybe two.  A question about what 
happened to your sister.
 
>> Jacqueline Mendels Birn:  My sister is alive and well.  She alsom arried an American. She 
is a grandmother off our little children.  She lives in Atlanta. And inyears past she has com e 
and joined us. 
W
e're on the phone every day, on Skypeevery day or  she's com ing on 
vacation with m e.  She's a very happy person right now.  I hope it continuesf orm any years .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right here to the gentleman in the blue.
 
 
T he question is,how m uch did your parents 
--
 
did they talk 
about what they went through after the war?

ﬁI
t was hard.
ﬂ
  
Shenever wanted to talk.  And I'm  not sure how
 
m uch Iaskedm y f ather because he was so 
busy.  He was selling jam from door todoorto try andm ake som em oney.  And my parents 
with their little jewelr y they hadat thenational pawnshop.  And we were wearing

down 
American clothes.  Life was so tough.  I guess he didn't have tim e, and we probably 
didn't ask.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to close the program  ina coupleof m om ents, turn back to 

Jacqueline to do that.
  
T hank youallf or being here. I want to rem ind you that we have First

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Personhasthe last

she's 
f inished

you can stay f or afew m inutes? Sof or people who didn't get their questions 
answered, I

and I apologize
