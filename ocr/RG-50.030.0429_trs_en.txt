G ISELA FELDMAN 
 May 6, 1996 
 
Questi on: It is May 6, 1996
.  This is an interview 
with Gisela Feld
ma n,  a survivor of the SS St . 
Louis.  Now first what I 
would li ke t o ask you is 
if you woul d state your na
me, your date of bir t h, 
and where you were born. 
An s wer: Yes , wel l .  My n a me is Gi sel a  Fel d man 
a nd my mai d e n  na me wa s Kla p l, K- L- A- P- L, a nd I  
wa s bor n on the 18t h of Septe mber ,
 1923,  in Be
rlin, Ger ma n y. 
Q: Can you tell me a 
little bit about growing up in Berlin at 
that time and abou
t your schooling and 
your pare nts ? 

A: I was born in 1923, as I sai
d, and so I had 10 years 
without Hitler.  My pa
rents originally came  
fr om Poland, the Austrian-Hungarian
 e mpire  of Poland, at t he a ge of
 15, s o by t he  ti me  I  was bor n,  
they ha d bee n in Ge r many for about 
t wenty year s.  Du
ring the first 10 years, 
what I can r e member is  
people still had housing shortages 
and that was a result of the fi
rst world war, and it was very 
di ffic ult t o get a dece nt fl at.  Bu
t t hat affected ever ybody, it  wasn™t
 something that we felt we were 
singl ed out for t hat.  But 
when it got to some of 1
932, I wa s nine t he n, I b
ecame aware of the fact , 
there was some sort of 
te nsion bet wee n the Nazi Party a nd t he 
Co mmunists.  I reme mb er ma rches in 
the street where people beat each
 ot her up.  And in the bloc k of
 flats whe r e I live d, a pers on wa s 
even shot because t hey we
r e demonstrating agai nst t he Nazi  Part
y.  So that i n a nine year  ol d,  
aroused some sort of fear  that
 s o met hi ng was  about to ha ppen. 
Q: What wa s  it li ke  at school?   
Di d you fe el ver y well ac cli mate d?  
A: Yes I did.  In fact my  sister
 a nd I wer e  the onl y Je wis h chi l dr
en i n the school .  And duri ng th e  
sort of be ginnings of t h
e Nazi part y I had a ver y good t eac her a
nd he kept t elling all the childr en t hat  
I was no di ff erent fr om a nybody els e 
and t hey had to treat me very we
ll and all that.  But that didn™t

go on for t oo long beca us e when I re a che d the a ge of
 11 a nd I had to go to a secondary s c hool, I had 
to go to a Je wis h school  b
eca use  it  was very di ffic ult t o
 stay on in a state  sc hool. 
Q: You had ma ny friends? 
A: Ye s, I ha d a, I use d t o pl ay
 with the children in the street 
and I di dn™t  feel t oo dis cri minat e d  
agai nst pl ayi ng with t he other c hil dre n in the str ee t , but I was a l wa ys bl onde and bl ue- e yed a nd s o I  

suppose that ma de 
a di fference too. 
Q: Was  your  fa mil y parti cularl y r eligi ous?  

A: Well, not  a terri bl y or thodox, but  I as a c hild
, I woul dn™ t ri de on a s h
ar bot( ph)  and I woul dn™ t  
swit ch the light on.  Howe ver my 
fa ther ke pt his  shop ope n a fte r goi ng to a service i n the mor ning,  
he ca me bac k beca use we lived in s u ch a Christ
i a n neighbor hood t hat, you 
know, we had to kee p 
the shop open on a Satu
rday.  And our customers 
really didn™t stay away
 from us until an SS man  
stood guar d outsi de t he s
hop and t old people not 
t o buy from J ews.  And e v
en the n, some  of t he m  
were very brave they came  in 
and we  ha d one  parti cula r  c ustom
er across the road from us, a 
Catholic baker, and they also were
n™t  ver y fond of the  
Nazis, and you know ba
kers  ha ve t o get up  
very earl y to bake their bread, 
and t he y found s o mebo
dy dobbi ng( ph)  t heir  shop windows , frie nd s  
of the Jews, and so they just p
our ed buc kets of wat er from t he 
ba lcony over t he m.  So t hat wa s  
really a ver y brave act i n t he cli mate. 

Q: Do you have a sense of how yo
ur parents felt at this
 ti me  and what di d yo
ur fat he r  do?   What  
kind of shop wa s it? 

A: We  ha d a  groc ery stor e.  Well , onc e  or t wice my
 father was beaten up in the dark when he came  

home from the shop.  And th
en things got a little
 difficult.  But you see, wh
en you™re sort of 12, 13,  
you don™t  quite reali ze t h e da ngers 
t h at were goi ng on.  But we di
d know of people whose fathers 
disa ppe are d or they use d  to go a nd sl eep i n ot her  
people™s houses, so when 
the part y ca me to pic k 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0429

the m up the y woul dn™t be at home, t h ey c oul dn™t be 
found.  So ye s, t hings  we
re getting very sort of 
disturbi ng.  But you know, people 
al wa ys sa y to me ,  ﬁ Why did peop
le not  leave earl y
 on? ,ﬂ and the 
onl y the ory I  can have i s, if you ar
e ve ry poor you can go beca use yo
u™ ve got not hing to l ose , and i f  
you were ri c h, you know at the be
ginning you were  allowe d to t ake 
your money out  w
ith you, but i f  
you are a middle-class person then 
you sort of value a little bit of 
security.  So that™s the only 
explanation I have be
cause we didn™t leave 
until 39 which was the 
last moment almost. 
Q: So the y didn™t tal k to you much a bout what th
ey we re thinking  or  about pos sibl y i m mi grati ng  
sooner?  
A: No, my parent s reall y I think pr
ot e cted us qui te  a lot.  They didn
™t show their fear s a great deal . 
An d our fin a l mo me nt r eally ca me wh en my  fat her
 wa s deported in 1938. 
 I don™t know whether 
you know t h at.  My father had a Poli sh pas sport 
and at tha t  time the Pole
s  said that anybody wh o 
hadn™t returned to Poland
 for  a number of years wa
s going to lose their pa
ss ports, and I t hink the  
Nazis got a little bit worried that 
they were going to be left  wi
th all these peop
le with Polish 
nationalit y a nd they pi cked up all 
the me n during t he ni ght a nd just 
deported the m to Pol and.  And I  
think that™s when thi
ngs  starte d rea lly to, for us , t o  reac h a 
high poi nt where  we  ha d t o decide  to do  
somet hing, a lthough we had to shut
 our shop befo re that so wh en 
my fat her  wa s deporte d he  di dn™t  
have any income anymore. 

Q: Tell me, just going
 back just a little bit,
 when they closed th
e shop, when was that?  
A: That was  sort of the beginnin
g of 38.  And the y also ma de me 
le ave s chool be ca use it was t hen 
deci ded education wa sn™ t  goi ng to 
be  muc h use t o you i f you ha d 
to go into a co
untry wh ere you 
didn™t spe ak the langua ge.   So pe ople got the i r childr en to l earn a tra de.  I went to dress- ma ki ng  

school , pe ople bec a me pl umber s, an
d _____________ 
and s o on be cause you 
felt i f you had a tra de  
in your hands you di dn™ t ne
e d t o know t he  la ngua ge.

Q: And what  was  your  mother .  Wa s 
your mothe r  a full -ti me  hous eke eper?  
A: No , sh e wo rke d with  my fa th
er i n the s hop.  And we ha d a 
maid.  Whic h of course I don™ t  
reme mb er which year 34, 35, you 
we ren™t allowe d to have  a n yone a ny more unles s t he y were  over  
50.  Be ca use  you know t here wa s thi s word r use nshe
n(ph), I don™t know i f you™ve c o me across it . 
But  t hat™s  why you™re  not allo
wed to have an
ybody under 50. 
Q: Tell me a little bit about when 
your father was deported and ho
w that came about and how you 
first found out. 
A: Well , tha t  was obvi ously s o met hi ng, a very we
ll kept se cret bec aus e  in October ,  the 28th of 

Oct ober I think, during t he ni ght t her e is a ring 
at  the door a n d two me n c a me in ci vili an cl othe s  

actuall y, a nd they sai d to my fathe r  , ﬁ Pac k your 
ba g, ge t your passportﬂ .  And you know that was a  
very fri ght ening experi ence 
and my s i ster pa nicke d, she™s thr e e ye
ars younger than I,
 and she started 
shouting at t he m and the y said , ﬁ We ll if you don™
t keep quiet  we wi ll take you a w ay as wel l .ﬂ  I  
mu st have kept calm because I 
re me mber I got up and ma de sandw
iches for my father for hi m to  
take t he sandwi ches.  But we didn
™t know why or what or  whe r e th
e y were  goi ng t o go, they di dn™t  

tell us, a nd whi l e the y wer e  wat c hi ng my fat her  I ru
she d out  down the st reet to go to a phone an d 
phone  my uncles t o warn 
them, but a strang e ma n answered the 
phone  so we  kne w the y had a l so got 
the m.   An d,  then  so me s ort o f  r u mor  ca me  ab out  
that they had b
een taken to the railway stations , 
and t hen all the women r ushed to t h
e railway st ati on to see i f t hey 
c oul d sti ll see the i r husbands or  
fat her s, but  we didn™t se e our fat her , but eve ntual
l y we hear d from hi m that  
he was in Poland.  And 
they had a pparentl y ther e  was s o me s ort of tug-
of-war bet ween the Ger man
s and the Poles because  
the Poles didn™t want to take th
em, the Germans wouldn
™t let them back, a
nd ther e was a camp 
where they held all these people 
whi c h wa s calle d bonchi n(ph) and but 
my father still had family in 
Pol and s o he  and his  t wo br
ot hers  we nt to the  fa mi l y.

Q: So a fter  he arri ve d i n Pol and yo
u wer e a ble  to corre spond wit h hi m?  
A: We were goi ng to spe a k to wit h
 hi m on the phone , we wer e  able 
to spe ak to hi m on the phone . 
Ye s.  Well it  was n™t war ti me yet, you see , it wa
s  38, it was j ust be fore Crystal Night actuall y tha t  
they wer e deport ed.  The 28t h of
 October, Crystal Night
 was in November so
 it wasn™t very far 
apart .  

Q: So tell me a little bit about 
Crystal Night an
d that evening. 
A: Well, I really got u
p, we got up the next mo
r ning, and you s ee not  livi
ng in a Jewish area we 
wer en™t so a war e as t o what had happene d.  Our s
hop ha d gone so re ally t h ere was n™t much Je wis h 
propert y for  the m t o destr oy.  But whe n we hear d 
about it I walked 
t o my Aunt™s  hous e and ye s, you 
wer e walki n g thr ough gl ass.  Y
ou know once you neare d Je wi sh s h
ops and the synagogue and so on 
then you c o uld s ee what  had ha ppe
ned.  That™s why it™ s call ed Crys
tal Night, isn™t it?  We were 
wal king on glass. 

Q: In between the time that your
 fat he r  wa s de port e d and the ti me 
t hat you wer e atte mpt i ng t o lea ve  
did thi ngs ge t pr ogr essi ve ly wors
e?  What  was 
it like for you? 
A: First o f all we we re  aske d 
to leave our flat , for a Ger man 
coupl e, and str angely enough my  
mother went to court and the ju
dge ga ve her thr ee mont hs, whi ch 
was quit e  unhear d of, you know,  
that he s houl d allow us t o  stay, a nd s o he gave us
 t h ree months, and we  move
d in with my aunt after 
that whose husband had also
 be en de porte d.  And the n my mother
 starte d s eriously to l ook ar ound  
for some pl ace for us t o go.  
Because we had no inco
me.  There was no safet y anymore.  We  
childr en c ouldn™t go to s chool.  So obvi ousl y, rat her late , but we kne w the n that we ha d to leave ,  

because you see even the lot  of 
the German pe ople
 I think didn™t believe th
at our friends anyway 
that he c oul d stay in power .  And a lot of the Je
wis h pe ople who ha d bec o me
 so much part of the 
country and the professi
onal  people  who hel d j obs  in hosp
i tals a nd eve rywher e, nobody could

belie ve t hat an i ntelli gent  nati on coul d all o w in a 
dictat or whi ch i n a way wa sn™t i mposed on the m,  
beca use Hi ndenbur g s upporte d hi m a
nd he re all y got i n by legal 
me ans but nobody thought that  
suc h a tyr anny c oul d go on but the y  are, that™s wh
at ha ppened.  And s o  th
en my mother started 
looking around and by that 
time it was very diff
ic ult to get a vi sa to go t o a ny count ry, a nd so people 
took any visa they could 
get .  I know friends  of ours went  
to China and eventually these Cuban 
visas  ca me  up a nd you had to pay 
for them wit h them 
with forei gn currenc
y, which really meant 
you had t o s muggle money out of Ge r m
a ny i n order to have dollars to pa y for thes e visa s, whic h my 
mo ther did, she smuggled money ou
t, and she didn™t even know 
who it wa s goi ng to, it  was s o me  
sort of code na me , you know s he 
talked to somebody ab
out uncle s o a nd so, I re me mber that as a  
child.  And t hen e ve ntual ly we bought visas wit h
 the foreign currency, a
nd which was supposed to 
be per f ectl y legal .  And t hen my
 mot her ha d to a rrange a boa t  to
 take us acros s and s he got four  
passages on the boat call ed the 
St. Louis which was meant to sail 
from Ha mb urg on May the 13th, 
whi ch it di d.  And t he Ger mans a
llowed people to come back into
 Ger m any providing the y were  
leavi ng agai n.  It  was a sort of transit  visa t hey 
allowed them.  My father applied to come back and 
the Poles s e nt the wrong brother bac k, s o my fat her
 di dn™t make it.  And so
 my fat her  phoned up i n  
tears and he told my mo
ther not to go without hi
m, a nd she must have  bee n a ve r y det er mine d 
woman because she said
 ﬁI have to take the children out.ﬂ 
 In any ca se, there was a not her boat  
leavi ng a ft er  ours , the Orinoc o a nd s he couldn™t ge
t four pa s sage s on the  next boat , but one s he  
coul d get, s o  she  was det er mi ne d t o
 t ake up thre e of the 
pass ages a nd my fa ther wa s goi ng t o j oin us  
aft er war ds on t he ne xt boat. 
Q: You had how ma ny siblings? 

A: I had a sister, I have
 a sister 
still, yes. 
Q: So at the time yo
u had your mo ther, you and your
 sister, the three of you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0429

A: Three of us were goin
g yes.  And actually the fi
nalization of the visas di
dn™t happen until the last 
minute.  We  were to leave on a 
Saturday and Friday morning we s
till hadn™t heard that everything  
was finalized, so my mother
 rushed off to sort thi
ngs out, t hen she call ed
 me on the phone a nd I  
we nt wit h he r, a nd t he n on the 
Frida y aft ernoon we got e veryt hing
 finalize d, a nd we phone d my 1 2  
year- old si st er and she di d all  the pack
ing a nd we  left on the  Fr iday ni ght . 
Q: Do you know mu ch more
 about  how she obtai ned... 
A: T he vis a?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: No, I™m afraid I 
don™t.  I just know that she had to pa
y with it for it with 
forei gn currency and I 
think t hey were bought a broa d, paid
 for a broad in the Cuba n e mbass y. 
Q: So your father  ne ver  ma de  it out?  

A: Never made it out , no?   You know, i f you know
 the st or y of the St . Louis , when we got t o  
Ha vana, the y woul dn™t a llow us to la nd, a nd the ne
xt boat wa s leavi ng t w o 
we eks lat e r, and when 
the capt ain heard that we coul dn™t la
nd I think the y got as far a s Ant w
erp, they turned back but they 
didn™t tell  the pa sse nge rs  the y were  t urni ng bac k, 
and they ended up ba ck in Ger ma ny and the n my  
father had to go back to Pola
nd and we never  sa w hi m a gai n. 
Q: So he di d ma na ge t he  next  boat?  

A: He ma na ged the next  boat  but he  we nt bac k
 t o  Ger ma ny and t hen e vent ually to Pol a nd. 
Q: So tell me a little bit abou
t the passage, initially you we
re on the SS. St. Louis?  
A: Yes,  well  we le ft  o n May t h
e  13t h, and i f you mana ge to get 
a hol d of t he doc ume nt ary, you wi ll 
see how e f fi cient the Ger ma ns are be caus e they foun
d all the old foota ge of 
us getti ng on, and the y  
even found me as a 15 year
 ol d a mo ngst all that crowd getti ng on
to t he boat.  But 
we left on May 
the 13th and fo r us youngsters it 
was  really quite an adve ntur e , bec aus e thi s wa s a luxury liner , a nd  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0429

the captain was a wonderful 
man.  He instructed the crew t hat 
we ha d to be treat ed like anybod y 
else.  We had to pay for 
t he r etur n j ourney, but  nobody reall y s a
w anything into th
at because we all 
felt the ship was going to 
come  ba ck e mpty and it  wa s onl y fai r  th
at they were paid 
for t his.  And i t  
wa s an experience to be
 on a li ner  where  you ha d a  cine ma  
a nd a ballr oom and 
a  s wi m mi ng pool , 
and all  the  usual  ga me s you ha ve on
 a  boat.  Obvi ousl y ver y fe w of 
us  ha d ever  be en on a cr uis e s o  
it was exciti ng for us youngster s.  
But my mothe r  never took part in 
anything.  She di dn™t worry us, 
you know.  And it  mu
st have been an awful  th
i ng to lea ve  your  plac e wh
ere  you™ve li ve d, and le ave  
a husba nd behind who didn™t wa nt 
you t o go.  M y mot her ha d ten 
ma rks, wh ich I don™t know how 
much i t  would ha ve bee n  then, perh
aps twent y doll ars or some t hing for 
the three of us, that is all we 
wer e all o we d to ta ke out .  So s h
e mu st ha ve  be en terribl y wor r ie
d about the future, you know two 
childr en, t we nty dolla rs, no job, not hi
ng to go bac k to.  And s o, but s h
e never worried us at all.  And  
during the fi rst 10 days we really
 had a very good time
 until we landed and fo
und that things began 
to go wrong. 
Q: Wh at was the fe eling within th
e passenger s wit h you as a teenager
 could get a sense of anywhere  
along t he line bet ween t h e...? 
A: The main thing is, we 
saw so ma ny people with 
shaven heads.  And i t ap
pears then, we sort  of 
found out they were people let out of c onc entr ati on ca mps , t hey had t o s i gn paper s t o say t hey 

would ne ver  return t o Ger many, t he y we re let out, 
and these people seemed to
 take longer to take 
part i n t he festiviti es t ha t  we re goi ng on, a nd so
 on.  We  ha d our  Fri da y 
night se rvic e s, we ha d a  
portrait of Hitler in the ballroom, but
 the captain allowed us take it off during the servic
es and then it  
had t o be put back a f ter the ser vice .  It™s very 
di ffi cult for me now to sa
y what I remember as a 
teenager and what I™ ve r ead since,
 of course , it™s  very di ffi cul t to
 separate these 
thi ngs .  Bec aus e  
there was al so a book wri tten abou
t it , calle d ﬁ The Voya ge
 of the Damned,ﬂ but 
unfortunately I feel  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0429

it™s a little bi t of a soa p opera a nd the y ma de a fil m
 of t hat too.  And so I don™t know if I know it  
fr om the book I read or whether I 
really knew it that there were pe
ople wat c hing us .  The  onl y thi ng 
I know is my mot her ha d a ca bi n on her  ow
n a nd one ni ght she woke
 up a nd found some body 
searc hing thr ough things 
and wal king around t he cabi n. And a fte r 
that she never sle pt a l one agai n.  
So I don™t know how mu
ch truth there was in it all, 
that we were being watched. 
Q: Di d you know be fore  you hit 
Havana at all  t hat th
e visas, the transit 
passes was canceled? 
A: Not r eall y, e xce pt some body sa
id on the way there that t here 
wa s another boat c o ming fro m  
so me where else, and I can™t reme mb er where fr om, 
England or some where  el
se, and they said, ﬁ We 
really shoul d hurry and get t her e before the  ot her 
boat  s o that we  don™t ha ve t o hang about  to o 
long.ﬂ  Now I don™t know i f there 
is any s i gni fica nce in t hat or not
, but for  certain we didn™t know  
anyt hing unt il we got the r e, and we wer e eve n to
ld to get up very ea rly the next mor ni ng and ha d 
our bre akfa st  and we  wer e lined up
 wi th all  our sui tcases ready to 
get off,  and the 
boat  st opped quite  
a way outsi de t he har bor.  Well , once agai n we 
thought that was quite 
normal, you know, it i s  
always deep enough for the boat 
t o go ri ght int o  the harbor and 
we ha d stoppe d outs ide, and the  
Cuba n polic e ca me on a nd the i m mi gration people, 
a nd t hen sudde nly t he  at mos phe re cha nge d and 
we wer e tol d, ﬁ not toda y, not today, meye nia n
a (ph) t o morr ow, tomorr ow,ﬂ but tomorrow neve r  

came, and then people we
re getting anxious bu
t nobody ever gave up hope
.  You know we were so 
near America we never thought 
anybody would allow us to go bac k to Ger ma n y.  I mea n nin e  
hundre d and odd people  t hat™s  real ly 
nothing is it , a dr

I  think Spani ards  and Cubans or s o me
thing, and one  fa
mil y  I  re me mb er

I think they were  just

that ha d c o me to holida y or to pl ay in a band or 
something but I really don™
t  remember t hese t hings. 
And one man of co
urse committed suicide and he
 was left behind.  And th
at I remember very well 
beca use  I was sta ndi ng by t he dec k  and I sa w hi
m rushi ng out of t he ba
throom with the blood 
dripping down a nd he r an 
to the edge and jump ed into the wate
r.  And one  of the  s ailors  act uall y 
jumped after him and rescued him.
  But even when he 
was in the rescue la
unch, he was still trying 
to pull  hi s ar teries  out a n d he 
didn™t wa nt t o be  sa ved.   
Q: He had cut himself?  

A: Yes, wit h  a razor blade. Because he‚d been 
in a ca mp and deci ded he wouldn™t go back, and I  
suppose pe ople™s c onditi on was n™t good you know 
when they got on the 
boat , their  mi nds mus t  
have been very confused 
anyway, and then to be fa
ced with t he problems t hat
 we might have had to 
fa ce, he c oul dn™t  put up wit h. 

Q: So what happen
ed, you™re in Havana
 for a few days? 
A: Several days, yes.  And then 
they decided, the Cuban authorities decided, th
at no boat could stay  
in the harbor for such a length of 
time and that we should leave the,
 I think it™s a three mile zone or 
whatever it is, and just
 go back and cruise around until more
 arrangeme nts were
 made.  And I 
believe the American Joint(ph) work
ed ver y har d  for us , and they wa
nte d to pay money for us , but I  
think it was more a 
political issue because I think 
whatever they offered it 
was decided not
 to accept  
the money a nd not to a c cept us.  Whate ver rea s on 
they c oul d give for us, I reall y don™t know, I  
really only know what I have hear
d since, so I don™t know what the 
political issue was that why they  
wouldn™t ha ve us.  And t hen we 
j ust we nt off a nd crui sed al ong th
e coast  of Miami  and Fl orida and  
the gun boat s came out i n case 
s o me body jumpe d overbo
ard and s w a m a shor e you know, a nd so. 
An d ev ent u ally whe n we t urne d 
back towards Germany, we stil
l really didn™t know what wa s 
happening because we di dn™t know wh
ich directi o n we were going in, so
 for quite a ti me we wer e in

a way left in the dark except t h
ey ha d a c o mmitt ee whic h a p pare

certai nly we teenager s di dn™
t know what 
was going on. 
Q: Do you t h ink your  mo
ther was involved in...? 
A: She was n ™t invol ve d 
i n t he commi ttee, no. 
Q: Di d she know mu ch more than 
you did about  what was  going on?  
A: Well , s he  never s howed anythi ng, you know.  I ju
st know t hat she ne ve r took part i n any of the  
jour ni ficat ion so obvi ous l y she wa s 
worried all along, so I really d
on™t know i f s he 
knew a ny mor e 
than we  di d, but  pr oba bly she s us pect

ha d a  greate r  fe ar t han we di d. 
Q: Now what was life , what
 di d you do j ust on a  daily ba sis on th

as a teenager, as a child? 
A: You me a n a fter we c oul dn™t l and, beca use be fore
 that we had a jolly g
ood ti me, we s wa m a nd  
played ga me s a nd went  t o 
dances and film shows. 
Q: After Havana wh ile you were
 in Hava na and t h en you..? . 
A: We ll, then really very
 few people attended the 
sort of fil m shows, and 
the dances, and all that, 
beca use  the r e was a  sort  of cl oud ha ngi ng over us
, even t hough you ha d 
hope t hat you wer en™t 
goi ng to, tha t  you wer e going to 
la nd some where eve ntuall y, but ob
viousl y it was a worrying ti me 
because you didn™t know wh at
 your future hel d for you. 
Q: Di d you ma ke  ne w fr iends 
while you wer e on the boat?  
A: Yes, I made quite a lot of frie
nds but really we didn™t keep it 
up because a small, 
a quarter of the 
people  ende d up i n Engl and, a nd 
a lot of those eventually got to 
Ameri ca anyway because so many  
of the m had quota numb ers t o get 
int o America at a future dat e, an

Q: So you were still in Belgium?

A: Yes .  
Q: And you all thre

A: Well, not quite.  We st ayed to

w days, because 
the Jewish Commi ttee, it was 
in London, it was Wobe n(ph)

 the hotel  for the fir st wee k, but I

A: It wa s se aside pla ce called Br oa dstairs( ph) .  
I t was a convalescent

actuall y and we  were  al ways  hungry. 
 The  di dn™t fe ed us  ver y well. 
Q: So this was the mi ddle of, this is

A: Ye s,  in f act we ca me  to En gl

towar ds the end of J u ne the n, yes , yes , and I  
stayed there until September and th
en I met a fa mily on the beach 
and they asked 
me if I would 
come and look after their children
 fo r them, of 6 and 
11, and I was getting in
 English money, 25  
p(ph)  a week and they we
re offeri ng me  a pound a wee k or s o
met hing, a nd so I obvious ly a cce pted, 
ended with going back to 
London so I accepted t hat  job and the ch
ildr en wer e as I said si x and a hal f  
and 11, a nd I was 15, and 
they asked me to do 
the cooki ng a nd t he c l ea ning, a nd i f  t he c hildr en 
coul dn™t  go to sc hool they as ke d 
me to write the letters to teacher

must have  ha d 
great fu n reading my 
writing, but still. 
Q: And what  about  your  moth

Q: Oh.  I kind of like, eventually
 we can get bac k  to wh at we wer e
 just tal king about , but you wer e 
in Engla nd a nd you were  worki ng for  a fa mil y. 
A: Yes , I wa s wor ki ng fo r a fa mil y th en an d the n 
of course the war broke out, and I wa s in London 
and we, at  one stage, went and sl
ept in the underground stations to
 prot ect  oursel ves  because of t h e 
bombing.  But I stayed with that
 family for about six mo nths an
d once war broke out, we wer e 
allowed to do war work, 
and so t hen my sist er had been evac

my  mo ther an d I  
found r ooms  and we li ve d togethe r  a nd I went to
 wor k ma kin g sol diers 
uni for ms and gunpowder  
bags, and so on. 

Q: Wh at wa s the name of the family 
that you sta ye d  wi th in Engl and?  
A: No I didn™t say that.  Nas h(ph)
, a ctuall y Nash(ph) yes.  It wa s 
an Engl ish fa mil y Nash( ph) yes ,  
cha nge d fr om Nas hins ki ( ph)  , ye s. 

Q: So you came back 
together with...? 
A: My mother and then event uall y 
my sister came back fr om her evac
uati on too, yes .  She went to a 
dres s maki ng sc hool a ctually and t he n had to find
 a  job.  And I wa s work
ing, but  in 
1943 I got 
mar r ied a nd move d out  a gain, I  
got married at  19 a nd a hal f. 
Q: And how did that co
me a bout, i f you don™t mi nd me aski ng?  
A: Ho w di d that co me a bou t?   I wen t  to a Cze c
h garde n part y wit h a ma n actually who ha s since  
became an actor, hi
s na me was Her bert Long, but he wasn™t  
an act or i n the days I knew hi m, he 
played in the Pi nk 
Panther films, but you wo n™
t re me mb er  that 
you are too young.
  But, and my 
hus ba nd as ked me  t o, we ll, t his  man a ske d me  to 
dance , and t h en sa w me  home a fter wa r ds and t old 

me that if I was still go
i ng out  with hi m t w o mo nths  late r I wo
uld marr y hi m and t ha t  was i t .  And 
my husba nd wa s 21 a nd I  was 19 a nd a hal f but he 
had no fa mil y.  He ca me fr om Pola nd and he was  
alone so possibly t hat™s t he r
eason he wa s in such a hurry.

Q: And so you are married? 
A: I was ma r r ied, ye s.  And t hen
 my hus ba nd dec i ded per ha ps  he s hou
ld go to uni ver si t y, a nd so he  
didn™t go to university un
til after we were married. 
Q: You st ayed i n 
London t oget her?  
A: For  a per i od, but the uni versit y 
he  we nt t o wa s in She f fiel d, a n
d so we  move d t o She f fiel d for 
four years until he
 got his degree. 
Q: Wh at was it like
 in London, you c o ntinued to work?  

A: Ye s, we had our  bombings a nd hi ding in shel t ers
, and eventuall y I t hink 
a l ot of pe ople ga ve up 
and j ust t ook thei r chances.  And of cour se we had 
the bl ackout .  It wa s very
 di ffi cul t to find your  
way around because 
in those days we still ha
d these fa mo us Lo
ndon fogs that 
you only see in 
Sherlock Holmes films nowada ys and I can rememb
er e ndi ng up i n s o mebody el se™ s  yard at t he 
bac k of the house bec ause it reall y wa s quite  i m pos
sibl e to see and find you
r wa y ar ound.  On t h e  
other ha nd one felt ve r y, very sa fe .  You know 
you™ d wa lk around with
out being able to see  
anybody a nd pe opl e woul d tal k t o you and as  a  yo
ung girl , you never felt a f
raid to walk about. 
Q: What was, as far as Eur ope
, wha t  wa s ha ppe ning in Eur ope a nd t he  holoca ust t here , the i n  
ti me ...?  

A: Well one didn™t really know how horrible it a
ll was, you know
. And we still heard fr om my  
fat her for some ti me .  But I™d just
 like  to back whe n we fir st ca me 
t o Engla nd.  M y mot her couldn™t 
spea k Engli s h so s he went to the East end of Lo
ndon, whic h was the J e wis h part i n those da ys, and 
she c oul d s p eak Yiddis h, and s he we nt fr om pl ace 
to pla ce, from s hop to
 shop, and as ke d some body 
if they could guara ntee for my fat h
er t o come out, beca use he c
oul d come i f  you ha d some body that  
wo uld guarantee for you, and in 
fact she found somebody who of
fere d hi m a job, and hi s pa per s  
wer e being proces se d a nd the  war broke out , s o he  lo
st  hi s second chance ther
e.  So I™ m onl y s ayi ng  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0429

that just to add agai n what a 
brav e wo ma n my  mo ther  w a s ,  ma ki
ng a decision for us to l eave 
without hi m with two children a
nd very little money,
 and then she immediatel
y set about trying to 
get hi m out, and s o s he  wa
s re ally a  ve ry a ctive woma n bec aus e  we
 relied a lot on he
r before we left  
Ger ma n y too be cause when we ha d 
our bus ine ss  eve ntual ly whole saler
s wouldn™t del i ver t o Je wis h  
shops , s o my mot her us ed to get  up at 5: 00 i n 
the mor ning a nd go t o t he  
ma rket s a nd bring i n the  
eggs and the butter so we could still 
sell the stuff in the, in
 the shop.  So she re
ally was a very, very 
strong, active woman.  But now getti
ng back to after the wa
r started, we heard fr o m my father until  
about 1940, beca use we had fa mily i n Roma nia 
a nd in Switz e r land so he coul d se nd t he mail via  
these t w o addresses.  Just recen
t l y I came acr oss a postcar d from 
hi m act ually and which I t hink 
historically is quite interesting because he give
s his a ddress  i n Pola nd, 
which was, the town was  
Ge sshue( ph)  and it says ﬁGe r manyﬂ and in brac kets 
ﬁFor mall y Pol and.ﬂ  So in e ffect you s ee onc e  
the Germans invaded Poland the addr
ess had to be Germany.  It is
 interesting, isn™t it?  Until I  
looked through all the stu
ff my  mot he r  le ft be hin d,  
I di dn™t re ali ze how r eall y hi stor icall y  inter esti ng  
that mu st be that they 
had to write thei r addre ss ﬁ G er many,ﬂ  
a n d i n brac kets  ﬁFor mal ly Poland.ﬂ  
Q: Wh at wer e  th e,  what  d i d yo
u hear  from your fat her, a ny in
dication of what was going on?  
A: There were only a fe
w lines actually, we haven™
t hear d for such a long 
ti me , are  you well , I™ m  
sorr y you ha ve to work s o har d, 
wr ite , and you know that
™s just these fe w line
s .  And my husband 
actuall y he  died t hree  yea r
s ago but before that went
 bac k t o Pol and beca use  appare nt ly t hey have  
quite a fe w archives there 
too, to see  i f  he  c oul d fi

my  fa mi ly, but they had 
recor ds of peopl e who died a nat u
ral  deat h, but not r ecor ds  of peop
le who wer e e ve ntuall y s ent  
awa y or  de ported s o we  ne
ver found out wh
at happened. 
Q: So e ve ntually t he  corre spondenc e j u st st oppe d?

A: Correspondence stopped yes.  
And of course the Red Cr oss ma de
 all sorts of inquiries so you 
know nobody turned up af
te r t he war, so one kne w that t he y had gone . 
Q: Wha t  wa s it li ke  whe n y ou  firs t, wh en  y ou  were
 i n Engla nd, what wa s it 
like?  Was it easy to 
accli mat e?  You spoke at l
east a little bit  of Engl ish. 
A: Ye s well , I mu st hav e  sp ok en
 quite a l ot, be caus e I wa s  sent
 out to do t he s hopping, a nd of  
cour se I was in that convalescent home, and the 
matr on t hat r an it onl y spoke English, and I think I 
probably learned quite a lo
t looking after the children
 too.  So, I seemed to 
have, as I s a y, l ear ned it 
very quickly, because I can reme
mber after I got married being ill,
 and the doctors 
saying to my 
husband, ﬁThat™s a real Lo
ndoner you™ve got ther e, is
n™t it?ﬂ  So I  must have
 lost my accent  fairl y 
quic kly too. 
Q: S o it  was  fai r ly
 easy accli mati ng? 
A: Yes, for me  it was, yes, yes. 

Q: How about your mot her.  She 
sounded like she, wher
e were you living in England, was it East  
end?  

A: No, no, we wer e n™t l i vi
ng in the East end, at one time we 
wer e livi ng i n Kli sl(ph) Park, a nd t he n 
eventuall y we had a flat i n West
 Hampstead.  Actually
 only a bout a year  be for e I got  mar r ied we  
took on that flat. 

Q: And di d you be come  i nvolv
ed in the Je wi sh communit
y at all besi des ......... 
A: We ll, not an awful lot.  We
 ha d J ewi sh fri ends and I had one
 parti c ul ar frie nd fr om t he boat  
actually, who eventually emigrated to Australia and 
I am still in touch with 
her and I even went to 
see her in Australi a, and 
some of the people fr om the boat, al
t h ough I hadn™ t  re me mbere d the m but 
when we had this reunion 
to ma ke t h e docume nta r y, a ctua lly t hey
 only had nine of us because that™s

all the y coul d a f for d, t hr ee pe opl e fr om Engla nd 
and si x fr om Ameri ca and t hree of the si x, I a m  
goi ng to see  on this  tri p. 
Q: So, you were married, 
and t hen you event uall y
 we nt t o Sheffield?  
A:  We w e n t  t o  S h e f fi el d for my
 husband to do his studie s.  
And he  did a degr ee in glass  
technol ogy( ph) whic h is  an unus ual 
subj ect, but be for e he fi nishe d 
hi s st udies i n 1946 we  br ought  
his pare nts  over t o Engla nd bec aus
e t hey ha d, in fact, the y li ve d 
in Kra koff(ph)  and a s t he Ger man s  
mar che d i n t hey marc he d out  towa rds  the Rus sian si

 the  Russia ns se nt the m right  
dee p int o Russia a nd alt h ough t he y 
had an awful war , t here were no
 wo rse  o f f t h an  
of t he Russia ns 
beca use nobody had a ny food, so t h

over  to Engla nd a nd t hey al wa ys  
said the y ha d be en the  ha ppie st year s 
of their lives.  So
 that was great. 
Q: S o a f ter  t he wa r 
everything wa s fi ne? 
A: Ye s,  ye s.  I mea n we l ead pe
r f ectly nor ma l li ves .  We  had our 
first chil d i n 1950, a da ughter who  
lives i n Ca li fornia , and we had t w o more chi l dre n, one
 of them we lost he died at the age of 18, he

Q: Is t her e a nyt hing el se
 you would li ke t o add?  
A: Well , I think per ha ps ever ythi ng t hat is of inte
rest I have told you beca use onc e I got  marrie d we 
lead a  fairl y ordi nar y li fe , per h
a ps not so ordi nar y  as far as pe
ople are concerned 
now beca use we  
brought his pare nts over , we ke pt the m for a w hile , 
and it isn™t often that th
e children are responsible  
for parents, i t is normall y  the 
other wa y ar ound.  But it wa s s uc h 
a normal thing in 
those  days.  You 
never fe lt that you had been hard 
done by or  you di d mo
re than you shoul d have
 done.  I think we 
often felt  ve r y sa d about  my moth
er .  You don™t r e alize unti l  it happ

years of mar ried l i fe and when we 
were youngsters we  thought that
 was  a  l ong ti me , but obvi ous ly  
it isn™t a long time.  And 
so she re ally ha d a ver y hard ti me .  
We oft en felt s orry for  her , but she  wa s  
never a mi serable person, and all sh

my da ught ers marr ied,ﬂ  and whe n  
she  sa w her  daught ers married, ﬁI j u

really t here™ s 
always people alwa ys hope for more
.  And t hen eventually she even
