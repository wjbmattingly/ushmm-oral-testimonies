DAVID KLIPP 
July 24, 1995 
 
Q: Mr. Klipp, will you begi n by telling me  your
 na me , where you were born, and your date 
of birth?  
 
A: My name  is David Klipp, I was born July 
nine, 1905, in a small Lithuanian town called 
Skudy, S-k-u-d-y. Lithuania small little town, 
where we lived with my grandmother in 
their house, the -- all little 
houses were -- on Fr idays, the 
baker -- there was a bakery 
open, on the Friday it was -- things so --  baked for the whole week for the fa mily, and so 

on, so on. Anyway, is -- my father, and his br
other ma rried two sisters. This mean my  

mother™s -- my mother and my uncle™s wife
 were two sisters. Then there was another 
brother, too, but I don™t have
 any recollection where -- I know he should only be in 
France some where, but I had no contact. My da
d, when he was alive, kept all the contact 
with hi -- with [indecipherable]. No -- in
 1907 -- you see, the -- 
all young me n were rev -- 
educated in religious thing. Ra
bbinical preparation, all kind in
 these thing, there were no 
other type of thing. No -- and my father has 
a little bit older ideas, too, and he wanted to 
build up a better life for his -- for his fa mily. So, when I was two years old, in 1907, he 

went to the United Stat es. Was in the United 
States, the first [indeci
pherable] was how to 
-- peddling, like all the people 
do, and so on. But later on, he learned to make sweaters, 
and established himself a littl
e factory -- factor y -- they 
call it factory, all there was a 
couple machines to make sweaters. No -- he 
was very prosperous, very good, and in 19-
0-10, he decided he is ready to bring the fam
ily to New York, and start in living. So he 
came back, but my mother didn™t want to go. Her 
-- her parents were still alive, they lived 
all together , and what is in the United States
? Wh ere is it? Wh at -- this is ho me, they 
knew only their world. So he had no choice, he
 had to give up the plant, and -- and he 

moved in 19-0-10. He moved to Lódz, Poland, where he established hims elf a little 

factory ma king sweater. The same  thing what 
he had there. Same  thing what he ha -- 

what they had there, and was a pretty 
good doing. Then the first World Wa r  broke out 
[indecipherable] Poland, 19 fort -- [indeciphera
ble] 1914 in -- and we came to Lódz 1913. 
My father went 1910, and the rest of the family came 1913. The first World Wa r got 

1914, and Lódz was occupied by the Russian army at thi -- this is part of the Russian 

sphere of interest, or kind of the s -- Poland 
for -- the country was divided in three parts. 
It was the -- what they call th
e congers Poland, were Lódz, Russia, and all this thing. This 
for they -- they were
 -- they called the Poland under -- 
under Austrian supervision, and 
they™re very compulsive education. And pe
ople had to go to school, and people had to 
learn. The third part  were in the ar ea of F
ooznine, which was more anti-Semitic oriented 

territory, so -- and so this was wa -- 19 
-- 1914, then the war broke out. Not -- the war 
broke out, the people gel prepare
d, Poland can never last five 
weeks, six weeks. So, what 
people did, they bought bread, put 
on cases of loafs of bread, this will keep us over the 
war, and so on. [indecipherable]. So the war lasted quite a bit, until 1918. Then, the 

Polish armi es became alive, too and so on, and there were the Polish armi es from the 

Russian territory, the Polish o
fficers were from t he Russian ar
my, and is all kind of thing. 
But Poland became a -- a independent to a cert
ain degree. No politic
al, I don™t recall too 
ma ny things there, but it -- it changed the whol
e life, in -- in -- in the whole area. This 
went on, then the Russian army ca me into Lódz, I reme mber the Cossacks when they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
2 
 
came in. And naturally they did whatever th
ey wa nt, and when they were going over -- 
they were in Lódz, and they saw a German
 plane flying overboard, a Russian soldier 
picked up his rifle and shot in the air, he 
don™t know what he is doing, what he shot, and 
this you can imagine. But this is the way, the le
vel of the armi es what -- of this time. In 
th-this, the war went on, and in 1920 -- 1920, 
Pilsudski came to power. And Pilsudski 
was more Socialistic oriented, and he was 
more cooperating with everything, and so -- 
and he was the one. The territory close to 
the German border what called the Posnine 
region was there, was General Halla, the anti-Semitic general whose soldiers were 

catching Jews from defl or, cutting their bear
d, and so on, all kind of things. In 19 -- I am 
going over fast, but there is not
 too ma ny things sink. In 192
6, I was called to the army. 
Yeah, until then, I was working, before, and I 
worked in a company where I did clerical 
work, and salers work, some  s mall companies.
 In 1926, I was called to the -- to the army 
service. So I went in octo -- On October the 12
th
, 1926. I had to induct to the army, and I 
was assigned to the Fosnine region, where Ge
neral Halla had his say, and so on. I went 
there, and then there was a very big limita
tion what a Jew can do, what a Jew cannot do. 
In the army, the regular probably hear the sa
me  thing. They need -- in the beginning they 
need young people to do -- at least to help, 
were write and read, and so on. So they 
needed people to the company office, to 
write. Who can read 
and write? Three people 
picked up their hands. I was one of them. I knew I will not make it, but I was one of 

them. So they called okay, there was one who was by profession a teacher in Poland. So 

they took him to the office, naturally. And he 
lasted about three or four weeks, and they 
get him out. Then there was another one w
ho can read and write, some  kind -- halfway 
educated. They took him in there, and he only 
last a few weeks, too. Finally they came  to 
the point there are nobody else. So they decide
d they have to -- no c
hoice. So I was taken 
to the o -- to the office, and this is not 
part of the military duty, of going through the 
military training, with all the [indecipherable] 
all the exercise, and so on, but in -- in 
spare time , day time, lunch time, evening, you do the -- the office work. No -- 

experienced I was, so they very fast decide
d that I can do the ho -- the payroll for the 
company also. Order was I get involved in ma
ny thing -- the -- the compa ny payroll for 
the officers and all kind of things. And thisway I get the contact with -- the battalion 

commander at this time, if I recall, was a majer -- Major Sheemak, in Polish majer, in 

English ma jor. Sheemak was on this way -- 
he was a son of a very wealthy Polish 
landowner and so on, so he had his own horse, an
d all kind of things. But he was a little 
bit a nervous guy. When he went to the casino, 
and he drank a little bit, he took out his 
gun and shot at a lamp, s hot at everything wh
at [indecipherable]. So then what -- after 
this was over, the followi ng day, he real
ized, and some how he knew the battalion 

working in the -- in the company office -- batt
alion officer. So he calls me  in, and tells 
me , ﬁ When I go to the casino, and I start to dr
ink, you come  with me  and take away my 
gun.ﬂ Order is order, I did it. And when I came in, he didn™t say anything, just took out 

the gun and gave it to me. This was -- this 
was not nice. And this way was on -- I was in 

the army until I went  to the -- exercise  the records there and so on, so on. This part of 

Poland belong to the division per -- General Hall
a was in charge of 
the whole thing. And 
when it came to the examination after the -- 
the three months, and the commander of the 
infantry for the division came  for the -- fo
r the high ranking general -- came down, then 
naturally they -- they have the bas -- the exer
cises. So when they start to ask question 
atfil, whatever he asked me  to do, and he 
right away picked on me . And whatever he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
3 
 
asked me  to do, I did. I considered myself a 
pretty good soldier, and I knew what I am 
doing. And finally at the afternoon exams in 
the class, asking question again, and the 
professional -- one the officers didn™t know all 
the answers always, so he picked on me. 
One of the question was, who did mo re fo
r Poland, General Halla, or Pi lsudski?  And 
behind him, there was standing officers, and he which showed me  to ma rk on the picture 

where -- where Halla is. I said, ﬁNo, in mi ne
 opinion Pilsudski did more for Poland than 
Halla.ﬂ So this way we have a discussion a
nd every question aired, 
I answered not to -- 
not to his liking. Anyway, this time  were over, 
and then we had to come  to the period of 
being sworn in. Being sworn in, they took, na
turally, because swearing in for Christian 
one way, and then all the Jews from the whole 
area, they took to a Polish son of Kalish, 
and there they bought -- they ordered a rabbi 
to come  there and swear it in. And then, in 
the meantime, waiting for the rabbi to come  a
nd so on, the officers ma de jokes. Naturally, 
anti-Semitic jokes were no problem there, so 
they -- they had fun. Finally there came the 
news that the rabbi arrived. 
So they had to send a -- a ho
rse and buggy to bring him in. 
Ca me  in a rabbi from the  part of Baleetshia
 what was until the ouste
r -- occupation, all t -
- Jew with a -- with a long beard, and so on, spoke a beautiful Polish. And they opened 

their eyes, how can he speak Polish like this? 
And he did his for mal thing, and he di -- 
swearing in, and during this time they -- they 
get a little bit respect for him. They didn™t 
expect him t o be such a Polishist. Anyway this
 -- this went over, and we went back to 
norma l duty. And I was in the army until Ma rch of 1928. 1928 I was released and I went 

home. 
 

Q: Let me  ask you a question. 

 

A: Yes,ma ™am.  

 
Q: Was your family fairly religious? 
 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Was your family religious? 

 

A: My fa mily was -- the background was a religi
ous background. This is only thing they will 
-- learned. My father was a great Talmudist. 
But the goal for you went there is to be 
rabbini cal educated, and what is much better th
an a rabbi, can™t be much more. My father 
hims elf was not -- he looked for something 
else, he had technical
 thinking and so on. 
That™s why he went to the United States. So 
he was -- he went -- he went to the United 
States, naturally taking all th
e religious books and so on, a
nd he came [indecipherable] 
them. Wa s t here he learned Eng
lish a little bit. Wa s not a pe
rfect English, but he learned, 
and he loved the United States. 
And he wanted to come  bac
k, but mother didn™t go. So all 
the way -- our fath -- my father, and my fa m
ily was the less religious
 of seven -- of the 
other brothers -- uncles, and so on, so on. 
 

Q: What about when you were in school?  Did you 
go to a Jewish school, or to a spec --  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345

A: I go -- it was -- it was a public school, it is
 called the Yarrowcheeskey gimnasium in pro -
- in Skudy I went to the haider, 
to a religious school, to a rabbi. In Lódz when we came , 
we went -- there was a building, a gimnasium, 
there were a public school, and then they 
have all the -- a mechanical school for mech
anical engineers. Th
ere was a big project, 
and there was donated by a -- by a wealthy fa
mily name d Yarrowcheeskey. We ll this-- 
their name  was called to the whole thi
ng, Yarrowcheeskey school. In the -- in the 
building of the school, they -- all they build -- they build it
 also a little synagogue, too. 
But they -- the headma ster of the school
 was not an observant Jew, he was more 
assimilated. And he was only the one thi
ng, Yom Kippur, to say the high holiday, Kol 

Nidre, he has to be there. Thus he is only 
Jewish is what he displayed there. Not -- my  
father was -- he had a good voice, was a 
good singer, and knew how to run services 
before a group and so on. And he loved my fa
ther. So he want -- he wanted my father 
when he is there Kol Nidre, my father has to
 do it. At one time  he 
was late, and the other 
people in the temple there, looked at the sun, 
cannot wait any longer.    At san -- a certain 
time when the sun goes down, you have to do it
. So -- and he wasn™t there. So they 

decided not to wait, and let -- 
conduct the services. To another fellow, not my father, who 

was to be in contorial duties  once in awhile, conducted the 
prayer, and serv -- everything. 
At the end the director came  in. His name  
was Shweitzer. He came in and he find out Kol 

Nidre is over. So he insisted --  he insisted
 that  the Kol Nidre will be said again, and my 
father has to do it. So there was a big rigama
role, it is against the lord, the religious 
[indecipherable] but finally my father said, ﬁLook, for peace, it -- it will no harm than to 

say it again.ﬂ So my father went up and pray
ed Kol Nidre, and he was really happy, and 
this is the way it is. Well -- well this is to show that my father was religious, observant , 

but he was not a fanatic.  
 

Q: Did you have any Gentile friends when
 you were in school or growing up?   
 

A: No, there were only Jewish boys in the 
school. The only Jewish boys. And on Saturdays 
you were going to the temple in the gimnasiu
m, in the building th
ere, and that™s it. 
 

Q: So you were part of a Jewish community in -- 

 

A: A Jewish community, that™s right. And th
is way we were -- we were brought up. No -- 
my mother was born 1892, and she died in 1920, 
at the age of 28. And this time, children 
were not told what illness is, or what th
ings this is. What do 
children know about?  So, 
naturally we didn™t [indecipherable] from obs
ervation. From this reached the doctor who 
is -- who was the main doctor to my mother
, Dr. Rosenberg, he was in the ghetto also. 
Dr. Rosenberg was a neurolo, so I figured al
l by myself there is something to do with 
neurology. So -- and my mother was extremely 
religious observant, she didn™t do -- at 
that time, the -- the doctor said you have to ea
t some thing fat, you have to eat not kosher 
meat, but eat what you need is fat. You coul d not convince her, ther
e is no way. So my  
father brought in a rabbi who lived not far, to
 try to explain her that
 even by Jewish law, 
to save a life you can -- you can
 eat things what you are 
not usually do. But, it didn™t 
work. There was no way. She died as a result
 of her illness as the Dr. Rosenberg was 
comi ng there, and so on, and she died on -- in Lódz, in her bed.

Q: Did you have any br
others or sisters? 
 
A: I had a brother and two sisters.
 My two sister -- my older sister
 went to unise --  my father 
was later very much for sending the children to the United Stat es. So, in the meantime my 

mother died, and my -- and my father was left 
with my older sister, myself, and the sister 

was born 1911, and the boy was born 1916. So my si
ster went to the United States in 
1922, went to the -- to the United States, and 
-- and I rejected. And I said, ﬁI am not 
going, I will stay with you. Whatever I can help 
with the family we will do together,ﬂ and 
so on, so on. So it was not the easier time, but
 we survived. My father had worked on the 
job, too, so in the meantime he was comi ng 
home  a few times to check what we are 
doing, and I was very helpful in raising the w
hole fa mily, and so on. No -- my -- and then 
came the -- the war. The first war was 
1914, 19 -- 18 - 19 - 20, we over this. The 
Germans started the war on Septem
ber the first, 1939. This -- 
 

Q: Let me  ask -- before we get to 
that, let me  just ask you a question. 
 

A: Please. 

 

Q: When you were a boy, and when you were a young adult, were you involved in any 
political organizations, any Zi
onist moveme nts, anything? 
 

A: I was interested in Zionist move me nt, and 
I belonged to a group what was into Zionist 
thing. And I was attendin
g their meetings and so on, and I was very much interested in 
Israel  at  this time. So this is the -- the way 
of life, what with the -- so I attended this as 
much time a s  I had. I had to work, too. And be
 a -- with my work, no ma tter what I did, I 
could help the fa mily a little 
bit, which was very important.  
 

Q: Were these organizations popular? 

 

A: This o -- oh yeah, this was the well
-known Zionist organization, a group called 
Yidaktout. The head of it was Dr. Takover 
[indecipherable] died in Israel. And -- 
 

Q: What was the goal of the organization? 

 

A: The goal organization was for Israel -- for Zi
onist move me nts, and to be able to build up 
a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a Isr
ael in -- in -- in post-
war. You see, this was the war effort. No -- 
at this time  there were not too ma ny people were 
-- were sent to Israel 
to -- to kibbutz and 
so on, to work. But my i nterest was with the family, to help as much as I could. 
 

Q: Before the war began with the Germans -- 

 

A: Yes? 

 

Q: How much did you know about Hitler, 
and what was going on in Germany?   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
6 
 
A: I was very, very much aware. You see, I wa
s interested in the an
ti-Hitler move me nt, and 
here now was a lady by the name  of I r en 
Hairind, I-r-e-n Hairi
nd H-a-i-r-i-n-d. Iren 
Hairind did a publication, monthly publication ca
lled Garaishdifite, which is justice. And 
there she reported everything what she knew 
-- what she find out from Ge rmany, so on, 
so on. So I was a subscriber to this. I work
ed on the job, and I did very well, and -- and 
she -- and I was -- as -- a subscr
iber to this. I worked for 
a ma n by the name  of Anatole 
Funkin. Mr. Funkin was a very well to do -- a 
Jewish fa mily from before the war, and 
you know, Jews could not keep in Pe tersburg -- 
this is the capital of
 -- of Russia unless he 
was a -- big merchant. No -- my father™s fa
ther was building railroads in Russia, so 
natural he wa s entitled to go. And his son 
graduated from law in Petersburg in 1890 - 
some thing. My father was born 1876. Some how my
 father met Mr. Funkin after the war, 
I was back already from the Polish army. And 
I worked on the job, and yet, at one point 

there were in Poland three main factories of artificial silk --  the big ones. The most fo r the 

French capital. And in order to
 get the representation for th
is one, people paid money for 
it, and -- and gave deposits, and ba -- the 
guarantees, whatever they had. But it didn™t 
work out with some  of them, and at one
 point Mr. Funkin was offered , if he 
[indecipherable] to say yes, so he will ge
t the representation of 
the one company, which 
was name d t he Hodakoof. Now, Mr. Funkin, he 
was us visiting, he was not leaving, he 
came [indec i pherable] so on. He had suites 
in all ma jor towns in Europe, mostly 
Switzerland, Zurich  so on, Wa
rsaw. And Mr. loo -- and at this time, when he was offe red 
this representation, he happened to be in 
Lódz, and my father knew him, how I don™t 
know, but -- and he wanted to meet me . And I was working on a job when I came out 

from the army. I was working there since 1928. 
So at one evening I went to me et him, 
and he told me  what he has -- he was a ve
ry well educated elderly gentlema n. And he -- 

and he told me he will only take it if I w
ill work for him. So I told him I need a few 
weeks to [indecipherable] my [i
ndecipherable] there. So I deci
ded in four weeks I should 
be ready. When I came after four weeks to -- 
to take over the job, he
 was out of town. No 
-- the other ma n in the company [indecipherabl
e] by the name of Vinerice. Vinerice was 
the president of the Cheskloveena lodge, and was in these areas. So I come in, and I -- 

they locate me , I say, ﬁMr. Funkin hired me  to
 start.ﬂ ﬁOh, he forgot
 to tell me .ﬂ But 
when you told me  he hired, you would do whatever you want.

Q: You worked in this business for how long? 

 

A: In this particular business,
 I sel -- no, I was start working for them for 16 years old. And 
different places were [indecipherable] town 
so on, so on. On this particular job we™re 
after -- we were -- I -- I star
ted in 1928, and I took over the --
 yet -- Funkin job in 1932. 
So -- and then -- and I wot -- I established myse
lf pretty -- really in
 the community too. I 
had a name , and my pers onal card opened door
s to ma ny places, and so on. There was at 
time that -- in Poland was very anti-Semitic, and [i ndecipherable] all over, and there were 

no -- as I said, we were -- we were married
 July the second in 1933, we went away for a 
few weeks, and then we came back to work. Had my apartme nt, and I™ll even -- Mr. 

Funkin, his family from his life had two big 
buildings, where I was there ma naging, too. I 
had the [indecipherable] for tony for them, and so on. And I had there one apartment for 

myself. No -- the orderzite I ma rried my step
mot her™s younger sister. She was a teacher. 
And then in 1936, she became pregnant. And so 
I ask her, ﬁYou don™t need to work, it is 
already -- the school is end pr
etty soon, and now, no harm wi ll ti -- be taken to the 
children if you don™t finishwith them. Let some body else 
take over.ﬂ In order to 
convince me  -- and she wanted to be -- some body mi ght do harm to the children, judging 

wrong, whatever it is. So, in 
order to convince, she, wit
hout my knowledge, she went to 
the -- to the top docto
r where all the big ladies we re
 going, [indecipherable] and so on. 
And ca me  back, and -- and brought me  a letter 
from hi m, he didn™t see any danger in her 
continue working. But it wasn™t so. At  one ni
ght she became very, very ill, and there was 
nowhere to go, nowhere to do. There was a c
linic at -- kind of a hospital what was a 
mostly frequented by the poor part of the pe
ople, the rich didn™t
 go there, and -- and 
there™s a -- not far from my house, and I 
had to take her to a -- to a hospital 
[indecipherable]. So fi -- I -- 
I called up, and they told me  
yeah, I can bring her. So I 
went, said then call up the doc
tor. Cause there were no docto
r and so on. So he says, Ooh 
yeah, if I --  if I get 20 zlot y, I,ﬂ --  so in mi ddle of the night, ﬁif I get 20 zl oty, I -- I will 

come .ﬂ 20 zloty was like hundred dollar here
, at this time was money. I said, ﬁLook you 
just come  there, and the money is waiting fo
r you here.ﬂ He came  in the mi ddle of the 

night to that thing. It turned
 out my wife was in the seventh month of pregnancy and had 
to have a -- so that they [indecipherable] it 
was not easy, and she almo
st paid with her life 
for it, but survived. Naturally, we did ever
ything, but what could 
be done? And after all 
she never regained her health
 compl e tely. After a long time  the doctor says oh, and we -- 
you are having a f -- a very comfortable j
ob, and -- and she wa s conducting -- still 
teaching a little bit, [indecipherable] little fo
r do something for awhile, then she had to 
give it up, too. So we we re livi
ng the -- the l-life at 
this time was in -- in Poland at this 
time, the big meal [indecipherable] the eveni
ng. Lunchtime with the -- with the big meal 
is there, so usually people me t on Saturda
y, Sunday in the café houses, which has a live 
band playing and so on, for a tea, whatever -- 
before they went out for -- for dinners, and 
this was our life, too. This was we were doing. Yo -- 
 

Q: So all of this -- you™ve mentioned several 
times that there was a lot of anti-Se mitism.

Q: You mentioned several times that ther e was a lot of anti-Semitism.  

 

A: Anti-Semi -- 

 

Q: Did this concern you?  I 
mean, you knew what was happening in Germany. You were 
experiencing problems -- 
 

A: No, this was -- this was before. You see, th
e Christian church in Poland blamed the Jews 
for Jesus™ death. And in -- in Germany after 
the wa r, a Catholic priest, a good friend of 
my told me  he knew, and -- and everybody knew 
this is not the case, but this was the 
cause the church used. And this --  so this was the anti-Semitism, was part of Poland™s 

life. And this was really helpful to Germans 
whe n they came in, to -- to drag down Jews, 
and so every Polish little kinder,
 five, six years old, could s
how all, hey, Jew, so some one 
took him away to work [indecipherable] and 
so on. This is the way the life was.  
 

Q: Tell me  about the first day of the -- when the Germans ca me  in. 

 

A: The German crossed the border on September 
the first. And this time we didn™t know -- 
we knew this they were [indecipherable] and 
so on. We  were -- we were home  sleeping at 
-- at one time in -- what four o™clock in th
e morning, five o™clock in the morning, a friend 
of my -- a -- a MD who was 
living a few houses away, knocke
d at the door and came in, 
and said, ﬁY-You are still sleeping?  Ev
erybody™s running -- ev
erybody™s running away, 
and so from the Germans, the Germans are comi ng.ﬂ I say -- running -- fighting is not my 

nature, I neve r went. So I say okay, I will get 
up, get dressed, I will see what the situation 
is over there and so on. And then the rumors
 for  the wome n -- to wome n they didn™t do 
anything, the Germans, but me n they take away, 
either with the work here and there, and 
so on. So it was everybody were -- all me n went 
-- tried to get away. Finally, I was talked 
into -- about eight o™clock in the morning, to
 go. So with my brothe
r and a third ma n who 
worked for me , we were walking toward Wa
rsaw. Nobody expected that Wa rsaw wi ll be 
capitulated in a -- in a short time. I was living 
in Rosso at the time, in -- in the building on 
Aubushna six. Aubushna six I had friends of m
y, and we were stay -- and I was staying 
with them. And -- and Aubushna six was acr
oss the Polish theater, where the Polish 
police from  towns were there staying, and so
 on, so on. So at one time they had to bomb 
the buildings, too. But everybody say there was 
a retired general living in the building 
you saw, every shot would hear, he said, the 
old people are being s
hot. And then finally 
at one night, this was on the 25
th
 of September, a bomb hit the building. And we were on 
the -- on the fourth floor. The sixth, and -- a
nd the fifth floor collapse. We  were on the 
fourth floor, and everything was burning around, a
nd we had to start the war. Had to start 
the war, and the [indecipherable] I don™t know
. So my brother a
nd the three of me n 
[indecipherable] we were walking. And the whol
e city was in flame, in fire. Everywhere 
we went you couldn™t pass by. Dead people and 
animal on the -- on the streets lying, this 
was a chaos completely. And [i ndecipherable] 
we saw this wa y, the whole night until we 
find the hideeron. Hideeron so on, until the mo
rning. And then there was no -- yeah, but 
this time  the German already came in. there. And we were running toward Wa rsaw, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345

running to ge t away from the German, ma ybe 
they will just stop, ma ybe they will never 
stopped. Wh erever we went, everything was burning.  
 
Q: I™m a little confused. Wh en you™re ta
lking about the building being bombed -- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: This is in Wa rsaw or in Lódz? 

 

A: In Wa rsaw. The big building where I was 
the [indecipherable] floor. And so then we 
were run to Warsaw and everyt
hing was afire. So we had to s -- we had to start to go -- go 
to a -- Wa rsaw, what we thought it mi ght be sa
fe and so on. It took us more than a week, 
cause we couldn™t -- daytime you couldn™t 
walk, so we had to lie down hidden 
some where. And nights you could walk. And 
finally we came to -- shortly before 
Warsaw, we came on foot so -- and -- and -- 
and then the population, mos tly the Jewish 
population ha -- had prepared dri
nks, and broth, and everything 
to try to help us to get 
[indecipherable]. But the ma in thing was, tookus over the bridge. And this was the main 

part. So I put myself up further to the bri
dge and there -- and there is lying a Polish 
officer, waiting too. And I ask him how it is. He
 says, ﬁLook, this is a l-long place was -- 
is constantly bombed. And here, if you don™t 
catch the mo ment between one set of flares 
gets away, and -- and the other come
s, you mi ght ma ke it.ﬂ We did. I saw 
[indecipherable] let™s fly -- with away, so I™ll 
know whatever it is, we have to ma ke it. So 
we on, and we crossed the long bridge, closer to Warsaw. There was a place called 

Majdanek if I reme mber right
, and there the people were 
standing, helping us with food, 
whatever it is. Then, finally we -- we came into Warsaw, and the German came into 

Warsaw, I think it was on September the 25
th
. When I heard the s -- the German are 
already here and so on, so I -- so I appro
ach the German column, and an officer was 

there, and I ask him if he can tell me if the wa
y to Lódz is safe for me  to walk -- to start 
to do. He looks at me  for awhile, and 
then he say, ﬁI on your place would go to 
Palestine.ﬂ So, nothing we could do. We starte
d to ma ke our way, slowly different ways 
going back to Lódz and it took us a long time, and we had to -- walking and hiding and 

all kind of things. And we came to Lódz at one
 evening. We  went in to the side of the 
cemetery there, and I paid some body to go in 
and call up my wife, tell her that I am here. 

He took the money, but they never ma de the ca
ll, I found out later. Th
e other fellow -- at 
the evening when it was dark, we took the 
freight car, we had no choice. And we went 
on, we ma de it home. Now then, from this one 
is -- life was different that the German 
came, and the German tried to take away every house where they can and so on. And I 

was ma naging the two big apartment houses for 
my bosses, too, but at this time there was 
no ma naging at all. I had -- I couldn™t do anythi
ng. So just living there, staying there for 
awhile. I had, before the war, working at 
Funkin, I had contact -- they were in Poland, 
were at a lot of companies owned by people who came years ago from Ge rmany, 

ma nufacture, so on. The young, when hi 
-- when Hitler came to power, the young 

generation, the young Germans went to Germany,
 and they became the Hatenkroitzer and 
this all kind of things. I had a conflict w-
with -- with one company, who was very good, 
very -- but the experience was when you see 
-- they were paying a 
lot with backslip. 
Those were checks with a longer period of tim
e, s o on. 60 days, 90 days, and -- and I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
10 
 
some  from the company [indecipherable] check
s from other people, other name . And one 
check came back from my exper -- and my pr
actice was mail it to them, and they will 
send me  back a check. [indecipherable] I ma
iled it, but I never heard anything back, 
because the young fellow was in head office, 
he was already away in Germany. And he 
wasn™t -- so -- but he came  back, as I was st
ill in the building, l
eaving there. And I saw 
him through the window comi ng in, so I ope
ned the door, and I approached him in 

Germany, a nd say, ﬁYou are comi ng to -- to coll
ect a debt.ﬂ And he 
said, ﬁNo, Mr. Klipp, 
I am -- I am comi ng to pay a debt.ﬂ And a
pologized for this what happened, and so on. 
Now, he wa s a uniform with the arm band, w
ith all kind German things. And that™s the 
way it was until we were living in the apartments, I was at my  father with his family, and 

[indecipherable] and then until Ja nuary 16. 
 

Q: Was your father able to
 continue his business? 
 

A: Father was sick, and I couldn™t get the me di
cal help for him. There was -- there was no 
doctor who could go to a Jew, and there was 
no way, and he had the illness, and finally 
he died on January 16, 1940, in his bed. I was at
 his bed. And the only thing we do is that 
-- use connections to be able to bury 
him in the cemetery, and this was it.  
 

Q: What other kinds of changes happened afte
r the Germans took over,
 for Jewish people? 
 

A: When the German took over there, they first of 
all, they -- they fight 
to get all the Jews to 
work. And then their ma in thing was to get th
e Jews out of central town. They establish -- 
it was already toward the end of nine -- of
 -- of ™39. There was 
already rumors of a 
[indecipherable] assigned as a ghetto. And -- a
nd they tried to force people to move there 
as fast as you can by their own and so on. Bu
t I couldn™t [indecipherable] cause my fa ther 
was still alive, but when he died, a day afte
r, they came in, and gave me  10 mi nutes to 
walk out of the building, and take whatev
er I can carry, nothing else. So we took 
whatever we can and -- and we start to 
walk toward the ghetto. And -- and my -- my 
friend there empty a room, e mpty apartment on 
one street, on Zigilska 36. So I went in 
and listen, there was no question asked. They
 open the door, you go in, and you are there. 
And this was the ma in street, wher e they build later the ma in artery, where they sepa ra ted 

with two halfs of the ghetto. So then -- 
 

Q: Pri -- prior to this in Lódz, were businesses confiscated? 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: Could people continue going to school? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: What was the life like for Jews? 

 

A: People couldn™t whatever, the life stopped. 
Everything was -- there was no more life. 
People just tried to get out, and they were
 encouraging with ma ny ways to people to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
11 
 
move away f-from there. So people we
re constantly moving, going, and so on. For 
example, my mother™s family carried f -- 40 jar,
 things with -- out th
ere. I couldn™t do it. I 
was told only whatever I can have on my s
houlder, and go. So it was -- there was no life 
any more aft e r this, until the ghett
o, and then we didn™t know what. 
 

Q: What -- were there a lot of the -- were th
ere attacks in the st reet, were the Germans 
around?   
 

A: Oh yeah. Every Pole you saw a Jew here a
ttack them or took them a way, can™t do this, do 
this, do this, and so on. And they were -- and 
the Germans we re just -- they didn™t care 
for this -- or wa -- they didn™t care to -- 
to defend, whatever it is. They let them do 
whatever they want, this was helpful to them. 
 

Q: So the Poles were attacking you? 

 

A: Oh, yeah, the Poles, and the German was 
helping them. A little Polish boy had a German 
soldier, and -- and he told him, he is 
a Jew, and okay, and this [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Was this some thing if you were
 walking the streets you would see? 
 
A: I -- oh yeah, [indecipherable] from t he stre
ets. I had in the building where I was living, 
and what was owned by my -- by Mr. Funkin, by my
 boss. I -- I -- I had a tenant who was 
from Ger ma ny region, the fa mily, ma ny, ma
ny years ago. And these were good friends, 
always, and we still good friends. So at one ti
me then I n -- I was in a jam, I went to 
every -- and advice, what should I do?  I coul
dn™t do this, I couldn™t 
do this. So I decided 
to up to his door, he wa -- lived on the second fl
oor, and go in and try to talk to him. The 
fa mily knew me  very well. And I come  to th
e door, and his son opened the -- the -- let me  

in, and I see a German uniform hanging in sigh
t. So he right away came out to say, don™t 
worry, this is my nephe w. Don™t worry, you come
 in, and whatever I can do, tell me. So I 
tell him wha t  -- in the meantime we™re going 
in a conversation with the nephew. And the 
nephew, a young soldier tells me  that we lost 
the war at this time. So I™m t e lling him, 
ﬁLook, you are a me mbe r  of a army who walks every day ahead, ahead, ahead. And you 

are tell me  they lost the war?ﬂ There is a Germ
an word, zieg, zieg, this me ans that we get 
some thing, we ge -- com -- he says, ﬁHerr -- herr Klipp, visignu stott.ﬂ This means you 

are getting so much of this good, that we aredie fr om it. And couple years later I was in 

the ghetto already, I received a -- he sent
 me  in a communication by some body that his 
nephew died on the front. Non -- at this time 
they -- okay, this was -- the German -- under 
the German occupation, there couldn™t be -- 
naturally there wa s nothing. My father died, 
so I had to go to the ghetto. The ghetto I -- 
 

Q: Were you -- one question -- one more ques
tion and then we™ll ta
lk about the ghetto. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Were you aware of any Ei
nsatzgruppen activities? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
12 
 
A: Ofwhat?  
 

Q: Einsatzgrup. 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: InLódz? 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: Whathappened? 

 

A: They were. The Einsatzgruppen were in the gh
etto, in the part of the ghetto, and they all -
- all around. They ma de a fence around the ghetto, and where we get close to the fence, 

could be shot. 
 

Q: And this was Einsatzgruppen? 

 

A: The Einsatzgruppen with -- the Ei nsatzgrupp
en with the whole -- th
e -- I think there was 
some  regular SS or regular army also, but 
mostly Einsatzgrup were the one who was 
marching with all thing. So it is -- it wa
s no way -- again already the ghetto was 
established, and Roomkofsky wa
s the head of the ghetto. 
 

Q: How -- how did he become  the head of the ghetto? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  
 
Q: How was he  chosen? 

 

A: He was chosen because he  had a big head of white hair, an ol de r, which means he can be 
the altesta -- the oldest of the Jews. About -- 
 

Q: Was he the head of the Jewish community before? 

 

A: Oh yeah, we did, but those were all Ort
hodox so -- and they were not acceptable, and 
there were no Jewish community, they we
re all gone. The -- the Jewish community 

before the wa r didn™t exist any more. It was 
a new -- new life in the ghetto. There are mi d 
-- there are different opinions of what -- 
Roomkofsky, I didn™t judge him so bad, okay?  
No -- Roomkofsky™s goal was to try to have as
 many possible Jews to survive. Naturally 
he was under orders from the Germans. Veego 
was the head of the ghetto ferbotten. His 
assistant was a fellow by the name  of Bardfis
h. But we had in the ghetto a circle -- we  
had one fellow who was  listening to the 
BBC news every day. And he was ma king up 
little notes that most political value for us, 
and I was getting such 
a note every day. I was 

-- ther e™ s not too many people hear  that, but I was one who will get it. Wh en somebody 

came in and gave me  a piece of paper, I knew what it did, and is that. No -- this fellow 

eventually when they -- when they caught up with him, he committed suicide, hanged 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
13 
 
himself. His  name  was Hayden 
Vidofsky. And was -- he didn™t 
want to follow life in the 
Germans™ hand. And dote -- the German h
ead as you know, a krippo [indecipherable] 
side, there they were calling 
Jewish and tried to get away 
-- all Jews had to work, the 
Jews were hiding, the Jews did all kind of thi
ngs they wanted. And from time to ti me  the 
[indecipherable] they were brought to the kr
ippo. There were only -- they -- there were 
also Jews who worked with the Germans in -- in the krippo. They used them to 

[indecipherable] to [indecipherable] to bring so
mething, to some  -- whatever it is. Now, I 
was the office ma nager of the fiflagunsaf
targum, in the ghett
o. Which means the 
departme nt where all the food to the ghetto, for the Jews, whatever the Ge rman assigned, 

came in to us.  
 

Q: How did you get this job? 

 

A: Mr. Roomkofsky wanted to get me  in the 
beginning. I understood -- I 
found that out later. 
There was a -- a lady by the name  of J acobson. Hers -- her son was a lawyer, and she 

wanted to promote her son, and when she ge
t wind that Roomkofsky would like to -- to 
see me, I never get called to see hi m,  until th
ere was a change  later, Mr . Stalshi Jacobson, 
by way was related to my -- re
lation t-to --  I know you very 
well as a kid. And but she 
ma neuvered him, and I was not notified until ther e was a change. Jacobson was at once to 

a different position, and some body else came in 
to his office to be the office ma nager, 
and in the drawer they found my na me that 
Roomkofsky wanted to see me , which I never 
knew. 
 

Q: Did you know Roomkofsky before the war? 

 

A: I me t hi m one -- I knew about him, but I me t him once, okay?  
 
Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: And he was -- Roomkofs ky hims elf was under 
the -- into very big 
pressure from the 
Germans, na turally, and he tried to get as 
ma ny people to survive, as ma ny possible, so 
on. So his approach to the Germans was, we 
have people of every line of work, we can 

do all type of work for the German could 
use, and what a German population can use. 
And he establish working results for all ki
nd of things. And the German were taking 
advantage of it too. They were using it and so
 on. So he was a couple time taken away by 
the German out of town again, but afte
r a few days, I don™t think -- you see, Mr. 
Roomkofsky™s secretary was a lady by the name  
of Dora Fuchs. Dora Fuchs was o -- the 
fa mily originally from Poland, and ma ny years ago, like ma ny, they went to Germany. 

They settled in Hanover, in Germany. And this Dora Fuchs became the secretary to 

Roomkofsky. 
 

Q: I think we need --

Tape #3 
 
Q: Okay. 

 

A: Okay? 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Okay?  

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Yeah. Noy -- so he had to change of s-se
cretary, and he found so 
-- Jacobson to the legal 
departme nts, Jacobson was the lawyer. So, at 
this time came  a new secretary to him, and 
opened the door and see a note to get me  to
 see Roomkofsky. So -- and he knew me , so 
he -- the following day I -- 
I was told to go to see Roomkofsky. So I went to see 
Roomkofsky. I come  there to a office, we
 are standing around, people everywhere. 
Rabbis, near rabbis, pela -- 
people, police, you name  it, everybody was there. And he was 
meeting some body in his office. Finally he 
came  out, and he looked around, ﬁI want to 
see you.ﬂ Left everybody stay and called me  
in, I™m going in. He said, ﬁLook, I have a 
big me ss in the fiflagunsaftargum,,ﬂ in there. 
This mean where the al
l food can be in the 
aprovasultsia, the -- all the food came in at 
once [indecipherable] there wa s a big me ss. ﬁI 
want you to go right away there,
 take it over, and ma ke order.ﬂ No far I knew about him, 
that there is no -- if I -- 
I cannot go tell anybody what I™m go
ing to do, I went right away 
over there, and I am wor king. He mi ght think he™s a -- he [indecipherable] I come  by 

horse and buggy, but I have to walk. So I went 
over there, actually there, and there was a 
fellow the -- o -- who head his office by the name of Roderusser, and he was unhappy 

with him. And Roderusser was not a real prof
essional, there™s a different story. So I come  
in, and I said, ﬁRoderusser, look, don™t worr
y. We will go, put everyt hing together. They 
will arrange it, and once 
you will [indecipherable] in the -- in the certain or der we will, it 
will work by themselves, unfort.ﬂ So, Rode
russer was very afraid, because Roomkofsky 
got aggravate, he could send him awa y right aw
ay to -- to be transported out to -- to 
Auschwitz, whatever it is. And 
-- but, he didn™t do it. S -- 
 

Q: Okay, I™m going to stop you one 
mo me nt. Stop tape please. Okay. 
 

A: Okay. What was there -- you see, the Jewish 
bakeries from before the war, that were 
there over on the ghetto, they were baking br
ead. And they had to come  to buy flour to 
the fiflagum some ti me . So what they bought in
 their Polish money, they didn™t get this 
back, because th-the German took a way the Polish money, t hey didn™t ge t the money. 

Anyway, when they -- this way he -- he came to transfer out the money and so on. I head 

the department with a head cashi er. There we
re fi ve people working with us, to get the 

money, sort it out, but -- and so on. The -- th
e head cashier was a professional cashier 
from before the war, from a big bank. 
From the same  bank where -- becau -- the 
[indecipherable] Mr. Rosenblatt came. I knew a
bout her, I didn™t know her. So -- but -- 
and she was just as a -- be fore the war, slowly
 do it, one time, think 
of another and so on. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
15 
 
The ghetto was no time for it. So fi nally I saw 
the one day, it doesn™t work. So I tells her, 
ﬁLook, Mrs. Steinbeck, you sit down 
at the corner, I will operate
 the cashier™s office. You 
sit down there and watch me . And then you tell
 me  if you ca n do it or not.ﬂ The following 
day, the old people got there, and counting the 
money, sorting out, and I was sitting there, 
and I was doing the same  time, collecting wh
ile I am paying out money, c ollecting, what 
she say it couldn™t be done. Circumstances are different, this is a war. So I worked there 

for a whole day. At the end of the day she 
came into there, ﬁMr. Klipp, I will do it.ﬂ 
Okay, good. That™s all I needed. And then th
e money -- what the Jewish bakers brought 
in, the following day, the Germans took away. There came a Mr. Schwinn was his name , 

a German fr om the ghetto Vivaldin, he came 
to collect the money and so on. So, from 
now on she was -- she wa s handling this, and I was to get myself back to the office, 

before the people -- and I had people whom I knew from -- fr om before the war, most 

accountants I knew, and they knew me  and so
 on. So it™s all cloc pretty well. We  
some how man -- and Roomkofsky c a
me  after awhile, it didn™t take long, I was there, and 
he was there. So I told him, Mr. Roomkof
sky, mi s -- [indecipherable] I think we called 
him, ﬁIt will be straightened out. Let me get 
to him orientity of what is, and I will assure 
you after I finish, I will be able to tell 
you that everything works.ﬂ Turned around, went 
away. And I started to organi
ze the things, organize the peop
le to work and so on. And 19 
-- going back to Roomkofsky as a person, as a charac
ter,  what it is. In 1942, he sent us in 
5,000 from Czechoslovakia, and 5,000 from Vie nna, and 5,000 from Ber lin. And then 

another transfer to 5,000 from Czechoslovakia.
 Most of them exsembly rich people. The 
lagers we told this what they had, this is 
the first time they had, they came in to the 
ghetto. So, had to find to do some thing a
nd so on. Among them was a Mr. Hirsch. Mr. 
Hirsch was on the -- on the board of most of
 the heavy industry in Czechoslovakia, a 
great lawyer with a big legal 
office, and so on. And he was a sick ma n. Now, I tried to 
help him as much as you could. At the same
 time we were getting in potatoes. What 
happened?  My [indecipherable] 
always. You know that from the farme r  to get permission 
for one shipme nt of -- of -- of potatoes, with
 the same  per mission we get five, six, seven, 
eight shipments of potatoes. So the whole ni
ght we are working, and I wa s working with 
them. We  ar e working with a little hand wagon 
what they pushed, what they pulled, and 
so on there, but they -- just to get away from
 the -- from the place where they are. At the 
same ti me, I had to watch to make Roomkof
sky satisfied too, that -- that I am not 
problem. Among these people, as I say, was 
a Mr. Hirsch, extremely wealthy man, and 
Mr. Hirsch showed me , ﬁMr. Klipp, when the 
war ends, half what I have is yours.ﬂ So I 

thought myself, first let™s survive, and then we
™ll talk. Then, as -- s
o, what I do with these 
people?  So, there was a little 
shack in the corner of the fi
flagunsaftargum,, there was a 
little shack. I put in in this sh
ack a long table with benches, 
and -- and there I -- I working 
five people, Mr. Hirsch wa
s among t hem, who c ouldn™t do anything else, they were not 
used to anything else. Everybody had their penc
il with the pad and sitting there. And 
nobody knew about this arrangement, the [i
ndecipherable]. Mr. Roomkofsky discovered 
it one time when he was down there, gwaitingto corner. ﬁHey, hey,ﬂ comes in there, 

ﬁwhat is this?  What are the people doing here
?ﬂ So I tell him, ﬁPrese
nt, they are waiting 
for the soup.ﬂ He looked at me , turned around, 
went out without saying a word. So, I had 
to -- so I am almost legal with them -- havi
ng them. So they were work over there, and 
were -- they sitting there hours, and waiting 
for the soup, then the soup came , then they 
went, and they sit -- went  to their families, to the qualas, wherever  they are. This was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
16 
 
going on for [indecipherable] Roomkofsky, his r
eaction, what a deleeng I told him they 
wait for the soup. This was for him -- and this to
ld me a lot about him. He wanted to -- I 
knew about him more than I knew him, what I h
ear, these activities a
nd -- in -- in -- in -- 
in the homes for children with thei r parents, all 
kind of things. In the part of the Lódz -- I 
was actually in the same place, in different pa
rt of town. So at one time he -- he called 
me , and he s a id look, here is a big -- here is
 a family what the father™s going into the 
army, and he has a family of small children. If I take care of the smallest, he will take 

care of the bigger ones. He -- a deal. So I say, I™
ll put in the smallest children in the or der 
of [indecipherable] and so on. Anyway, this 
-- this worked pretty good with him. This 
went on until -- and yeah, and -- and every 
day Mr. Shrink was comi ng, collecting the -- 
the -- the -- the Polish money, take away the or
der. At the same  ti me  Mr. Meemorf, who 
was before the war a coffee me rchant, a big co
ffee me rchant, and he created for hims e l f, 
after the war he should have some thing too. So 
he was sending in to the ghetto things like 

cacao, tea, rice, some thing like it -- it was -- 
what he couldn™t touch, and told  not to 
touch it. And whatever a transport came in of
 his things, the following day he was in, and 
I had to give him a report what I have. Matc
h a long  paper, everyt
hing was beautiful. It 
always ma tch. But, I had people with epidamia
, dysentaria, all kind of, all kind of -- and 
rice was the only thing what I had. So Ihad the -- the man who -- who headed the 

[indecipherable] the ma gazine, a fellow Moshbe
rg, he didn™t survive, I -- he was a very 

nice guy, so I told him, ﬁ Look, let™s opim a sacr
ifice, and when people call, they having 

dysentaria with the -- give them a little b
it rice, so nobody should know that you were the 
only one who can give what they need.ﬂ And 
this [indecipherable] for awhile. So finally 

the German collected all -- all 
the mo ney and so on, and I s 
--  falsified Roomkofsky with 
the cash -- with the -- 
with the handling and so on, and it worked smoothly. So -- so the 
office worked, and I could award it to myself
 too, to taking care of [indecipherable] and 
all kind of things. 
 

Q: Estelle -- it -- we™re hearing it -- 

 

A: So, and this was -- the ghetto was goin -- goi
ng like it -- like this until they -- they started 
to liqui date the ghetto. 
 

Q: Okay, then let™s -- I wa
nt to ask you questions -- 
 

A: Well now [indecipherable] 

 

Q: [indecipherable] if that™s okay. 
You were talking about Roomkofsky. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: I think that he was c
ontroversial in ma ny ways. 
 

A: Hewhat? 

 

Q: Wascontroversial. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
17 
 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: People felt that there was a lot of corruption 
with the officials, and the police, and do -- 
was that some thing you were aware of? 
 

A: Oh yeah. In cases like this, without corr
uption, nothing can be done. You see, what is, 
there was more -- most people who were involved there -- he was the head of the ghetto 

for about -- of the ghetto, Roomkofsky, but th
en the other departme nt, who could ma ke 
all those deal s with the Germans to duplicat e or
 triplicate potatoes, shipments, all kind of 
this. Some body who knew the underworld a little  bit. And there was -- and fellows who 

were active in the more advanced under-unde
rground thing, they came to power, and they 
were -- would they know how to handle, how
 to buy, whom t o buy, what to buy with, and 
so on. And there was -- and this was the ma in
 thing, was nothing what they could do to it. 
You see, he thi -- this is the way we are get
ting in potatoes mu ch more than we -- than we 
should have, and all the food items, and so on, so 
on. But all lead to thei
r activities, it was 
a means for us to get it.  
 

Q: So you got more than -- than what you were officially allowed? 

 

A: Oh yeah, no question about. You see, the -- 
whatever they officially send in, that the 
ghetto can afford, it was divided by the corpor
ation, by so ma ny, and we have distribution 
points, and we gave out, whenever this [indeci
pherable] what is the number of people in 
this area, and we gave them as much peopl
e a -- a -- as much food as was there. But 
nothing officially came in. The unofficial we c
ouldn™t touch. So it was a -- there is -- in a 
case like this there were no normalities, forget about normality at this time. Everythi ng -- 

most people from the -- I would call them 
underground for this. But most people came to 
power, came  to di -- let™s say we create
d a sondercommando, was created in ghetto. The 
purpose of the -- of the sondercommando was to -- 
to try to get from the Jews the jewe l, 
their values,  whatever this is, and so on, a
nd give them to the German. Now those people 
are involved in it, they are people too. So
 they knew how to handle who could work, no -- 

the -- the head of the departme nt was a fello
w by the name  of David Ye elgla. He hims elf 
has a background, what I don™t know. He became 
a big ma n in the ghetto. His assistant 
was a fellow by the name of Mark Kleeger, whom I knew. And Mark Kleeger was the 

educated fellow, and -- and no other one was 
the -- doing, the connecti
on, the bribing, the 
all -- the all kind of th
ings. And this ghetto -- how they, if
 they collected some thing, what 
they did, they give in to the German or 
not. Naturally there were
 [indecipherable] and 
you couldn™t expect -- if they had to bribe Germ
an, they had to take it from some whe r e, 
so they took from the [indecipherable] and buy 
the German whatever it is. It is in -- in 
such a time there is very hard to --  to talk
 about legal, and with lawyer, with problems, 

and this is the way they get the [i ndeci pherabl e] it.  
 

Q: But was it a situation where the people who had so me power, their families were much 
better taken care of -- 
 

A: Yes, there was -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
18 
 
Q: -- while people were starving? 
 

A: -- there was. Mr. Roomkofsky had a group of people who used to get what they call 
talons. The leader of the departme nt was a Mi
ss Ivershitz, yeah Ivershitz. And she gave -- 
and people of those fa milies were in char
ge of some thing, who were -- who were 
considered he lping Roomkofsky run the whole 
thing, they we re getting talons for their 
fa milies. Wa s -- 
 

Q: Will you just explain what a talon is? 

 

A: A talon, there was such a coupon to go and pick
 up some  food, whatever it is, to different 
departments. That™s a -- but --  
 

Q: Well I -- yeah -- explain that
 again, though, there was a car honking. 
 

A: Oh-oh. A talon, what you call that this th
ing was a piece of paper what Roomkofsky 
departme nt gave out for those people to go to
 a meat department, get some meat, to this 
to get some  these, and so on, and he -- no, we had in ghetto the  -- another thing, too. 

Those Jews who worked [indecipherable] kri
ppo, and those Jews who worked with the 

krippo, they were going to town with the kri ppos, and so on, so on. And they were alwa ys 

comi ng in and he need a loaf of bread for 
a German, [indecipherable] for themse -- this 

the way it went. I gave it to them. Those pe
ople that are going, a
nd there was we -- we 
have no medication, for example. And medicatio
n was a very important thing for a lot of 
people. The most thing, B12 was a very -- 
why tha -- those people who were working 
with the Germans to ghetto, they could get it if I contact them. So, there was a fellow 

whom I knew, some  wa -- he came  to ask fo
r some thing, and I used this connection. The 
name  was Wortma n, he was old. [indecipherabl
e] to talk with them, and so on, so on. 
And I always told him I have a request for th
ese, for [indecipherable
] for other thing, and 
he tried to ge t me , because he wanted some thing in return, bread, or whatever it is. And 

this way -- and this was my contact with
 the -- with the unoffi
cial [indecipherable] 
departme nt [indecipherable] to use them as
 muc h as I could. And -- and when I get 
me dication, I had the problem who to give it. If
 I had a secretary to 
the fiflagunsaftargum 
-- Dagushensky, Yelsi Da gushensky, her father wa s before the war the -- the cormeister 

for the Jewish temple. And he was a sick ma n, a elderly ma n. And I get one me dication 

what she needs for her father, and then 
was a young mother who need it. Who should I 
give it to you?  I give 
it to the young mother. And -- and I became  a -- a enemy of 
Dagushensky because I felt a y -- a young moth
er with a -- with 
a little baby, if you 
couldn™t help her, we are in -- we are in a 
pievin to a certain way, we have to ma ke 
choices what are not norma lly done, but has to 
be done. So this way -- this way it works.  
 

Q: Were you able to help a lot of people in your position? 

 

A: I did. As mu ch as I could. Every time this Mr. Wo rtma n went to town with a krippo, I 
give [indecipherable] and I was sitting and waiti
ng, and finally I -- get me  these thing, get 
me these thing. Whatever I ge
t, I get away, I think I help
ed, because I didn™t need 
anything for myself, I gived everything away.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
19 
 
 
Q: Did you have a lot of -- did you ge
t special privileges because of -- 
 

A: I didn™t use them. I never ac-accepted a regular --
 what I called talon before , a little slip to 
go and get milk, and I had contact with it. You 
see, if I wanted, if 
I would -- let™s say the 
head of the meat departme nt -- and there wa
s mostly horseme at, there was nothing else -- 
so if I wanted to get meat, I could give hi
m a loaf of bread, he 
would give me  meat. I 
didn™t do it. I felt that this is
 dishonest, and I am not in 
the position to be able to use 
dishonesty just to -- to -- I 
didn™t use it, except when I came 
to a point when my wife was 
very ill, and I did get a differe
nt type of food. So I  talked to
 -- I was [inde
cipherable] say 
I need a special talon  for my 
wife, certain food and so on, and I 
get it. But this is the only 
time I was using it for my own. Never did.  
 

Q: You know, well, let me  ask you, were your 
contacts mostly with the admi nistration 
within the ghetto, or did you also have
 contact with the German authorities? 
 

A: With the German no, nothing whatsoever. Only 
the Jewish army station in the ghetto, and 
-- and the main thing was, everything what
 came  about from Kofsky. The  ma nager of the 
-- ferfling of the food departme nt where I 
was working was Roomkofsky™ s ex-partner 
from years ago, friend of his. And he put hi
m in charge of the departme nt. Then every 
departme nt had a commissar also. A high poli
ce ranking officer who was assigned to, and 
he what -- had to handle. In my case there was a fellow by the name  of Re ingold, 

Sigmund Reingold. So this is th
e way it -- it operates.  
 

Q: But this Reingold was part of the Jewish admi nistration? 

 
A: Part of the Jewish admi nistration. 
 

Q: Maybe you can explain s -- how complex the 
Jewish admi nistration 
was in the ghetto, it 
was pretty large, wasn™t it? 
 

A: The Jewish admi nistration was fully well or
ganized. We  had the departments, we have a 
kitchen departme nt, who was responsible for 
cooking soups and so on. And we have all 
kinds departme nts for -- for a different spec
ialty for different work and so on. And the 
most what I was connected with was -- was 
the -- the department 
wa -- where the food 
came through. And they were very we ll organi
zed. There was a -- le
t™s say there was a 
what you call me ldinkovi -- registration of pe
ople, of vadiserobun, which was headed by 
a good friend of my, Naftali, a lawyer [i
ndecipherable]. And let™s say when some body 
needed a job for some body, he went there and 
asked for an assignment for a job. And one 
time Mr. Shinsheevy, my  ma nager come s up to me, and say, ﬁLook, Dave, I know you 

know everybody, I need a job for two girls. Canyou get it for me ? ﬂ  I said, ﬁSure, I will 

try to do it.ﬂ And by this -- okay -- Es telle wa
s one of the girls who he gave her the job. 
And this is the fi rst time I met her ther e. When
 she sa -- heard, or saw that sh -- he asked 
me  for jobs for the two girls, she came  up -- and she graduated the same  year from -- 

from -- from high school, and I saw her di
ploma, everything excellent, she was a good 
student. And the other girl was another girl th
ere whom I didn™t know it. And so I went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
20 
 
the department and came with the assignmen
t -- with those two jobs. And they -- and 
they were both employed. Estolle originally 
was with the departme nt where it was near 
the [indecipherable] everything was going ups 
and so on. And -- and Estelle I assigned to 
the department where the soup talons were 
given out, in [indeciphe
rable] departme nt. 
Everyone who works here the Jew, [indecipherable] me  the Jew. The soup -- 
 
Q: Are you saying Estelle your wife now? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: You knew her then?  

 

A: Yeah, we married -- at this time she 
was not, but we ma rried in 1946 in Germany. 
 

Q: Oh. Let™s change the tape 

 

End of Tape #3 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345

Tape #4 
 
Q: Sorryaboutthat. 

 

A: Okay. So, he ask question, I will answer. 

 

Q: Okay. We ll, back to what you could do in this position. The food all came  in from the 
Germans, they contro
lled how much you got? 
 

A: That™s right. We  have a sp
ecial departme nt who was the di
stribution departme nt, and the 
head of it was a fellow by the name  Shish
eesky, was a engineer, he
 didn™t survive. And 
then they will figure out how much food to give
 to each point for the people leave, and so 
on, and -- and people came  with th
eir food carts, what they have, to go to pick it up, what 
is assigned to them, and so on, and pay for it.  
 

Q: Now, was there a different amount of food that
 could go to classifica
tions of people, like 
people who were working, or wome n, or 
people [indecipherable] officials -- 
 

A: Every -- everything was for working people,
 there was no provision for not working. 
 

Q: So where did they eat? 

 

A: So, we divided f-for the number of 
-- population. You couldn™t do it otherwise. So 
everybody gets some thing. 
 

Q: So that was up to you? 
 
A: This was up to the departme nt was wi th 
doing it, n-not me  personally. I was busy with 
the office downstairs, operations, so on. But 
we -- we knew how much pe ople there are in 
the ghetto, how much pe ople, so we figure out.
 Mr. Sheesheestio was on top of his -- he -
- and he, with the -- the -- be the ma nageme nt
 came to the conclusion this why -- this is 
how much we can give to everyone and soon. And people were going 
to the distribution 
point, and picked it up. 
 

Q: So the food the Germans gave you was only for the working people? 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: And then you had to figure out how much you 
could allot to other pe
ople who were not -- 
 

A: This for the departme nt to figure it out. We
 have so much food, and so ma ny people, so 
we can give only the -- that much. 
 

Q: Now, were you able to kind of ma nipulate th
e statistics to show th
at there were more 
people who needed food, or -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
22 
 
A: No. 
 

Q: Like, if people died you
 wouldn™t report them, or -- 
 

A: No, this wa -- th-this was not in my
 hands at all. This was not my part. 
 

Q: Was that being done? 

 

A: We saw the li -- we saw this -- how ma ny peopl e there were, were report from every day. 
This is how ma ny peopl e to get ahead. And 
people were dying, and people were getting 
won too. Get ready and so on. We  -- we tried 
to run the ghetto with normal life, with 
musical concerts, with pe rforma nces, with al
l kind of things. To ma ke as much as 
possibly we will -- young people get ma rried, an
d those thing happened. So this is with -- 
tried to ode a active life  what it is.  
 

Q: Did you -- did you provide soup ki
tchens and things like that? 
 

A: We had soup kitchens, was -- especially ki
tchen departme nt, who was responsible for the 
soups, and sent the soup for every departme nt
. And the head of th
e -- the office ma nager 

of the office, head of this was a fellow by 
the name of Boller, who at one time at a 
meeting, Roomkofsky as k him, ﬁHow much cost
 us this soup? ﬂ  He says, ﬁI don™t know, 
because I™m getting free everythi ng from Dave.ﬂ 
 

Q: The soup kitchens were -- now, or -- origin
ally we re they privat
ely run, and then the 
governme nt took them over? 
 
A: No. All g -- run always by the ghe
tto. There was no pr
ivate an-anything.  
 
Q: So the -- so the ghetto governme nt
 controlled every aspect of life? 

 

A: Every aspect of life, th
e ghetto was under control. 
 

Q: And there were no independent -- 

 

A: No, no.  

 

Q: Even the theaters, and the schools, and everything? 

 

A: So the schools were under 
supervision of the ghetto, and 
everything. There were -- school 
departme nt what took care, and they had to 
report to Roomkofsky, I™m sure, and so on. 
But -- but everything wa
s run from t he top.  
 

Q: Was it efficient? 

 

A: Yeah. Fully efficient under the circumstances.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
23 
 
Q: What were the living co
nditions like in the ghetto? 
 
A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: What were the living conditions like? 

 

A: The living conditions we re not good. We  were
 camped in s mall apartments, mostly. Let™s 
see, we had to occupy the -- the place wh
ere prior was the Polis
h underground, the Polish 
-- not underground, but the Polish volespart. They
 moved their mouth to a -- to a different 
area so the Je ws can take over their quarters. 
For example, the office where I worked was 

on Droska six. My room -- room with a sma
ll kitchen was Droska 15, across the street. I 
want to be close if some thing happen, I can
 always communicate and so on. So it -- it was 
very crampe d, was me , my wife, and my sist
er. And there is a la
dy here whom I knew, 
who works with my sister in that departme nt
 where the jobs are assigned to and so on. 
 

Q: I thought your sister went
 to the United States, no? 
 

A: My older sister, I had two.  

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: My older sister came  in 1922.  

 

Q: Okay. So this was your
 -- another sister.  
 

A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did you have -- did you have 
plumbing, did you have sanitation? 

 

A: There was water inside, but you had to go to
 sanitation outside. Wa
s a faucet for water 
was.  
 

Q: Did you feel -- I mean, you worked in the food departme nt, so you had enough to eat? 

 

A: Not necessarily, I didn™t ta
ke anything more than I had.This was my thing. I didn™t use 
my job for personal be nefit, until I needed he
lp for my wife. Until then, no. I ti -- I could 
have it easily, I could go to any departme nt 
and get meat, for bread, and this for thi -- I 
didn™t feel  this is the ri ght thing to do. Y
ou see, as a matter of fact, the war there™s -- 
before there war there™s so ma ny political
 organizations, Jewish, Zionist, Bund, and you 
name  it. And -- and I was active in the Zionist 
mo veme nt before the war, so after the war 
they came in, oh, this organize, I said, ﬁNo, I 
am a  Jew here. I am not a  Zionist, I would 
not, and I am a Jew here.ﬂ And they see the 
way it is. I didn™t -- went away from it. 
 

Q: Were these organizations active in the ghetto? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
24 
 
 
Q: Were these organizations still active in the ghetto? 

 

A: Oh, the many -- the -- all orga
nizations were active there. 

 

Q: The Zionists, and the Bund? 

 

A: Yeah, they all had groups. I never attended, I ne
ver was interested. What I di -- feel this is 
the proper thing to do.  
 

Q: Do you -- were you aware of efforts to sabotage 
work in the factories,
 or for people to try 
to get out of the ghetto, 
any kind of resistance? 
 

A: Not to ob -- not to [indecipherable] no. I™m
 no -- people usually works in the different 
resorts some where. I di -- nobody wa
s there was happy. Everybody had thousand 
complaints, probably, but the circumstances we
re different. The si -- the interest of 
Roomkofsky was t-to -- all those resorts wor
k, and operate. So there was not much. It 
could be done if you -- if the -- some  people 
did dishonest things, I™m sure they did. For 
example, some  people did things where they
 were not informed -- where they had no 
right to do anyway. I found out af
ter the war mainly a few cases
 like it. So it is -- but in 
doing the ghetto, and in the -- during the life
 on it, was a different story. I considered 
myself a me mber of the ghetto, and I have to
 live like everybody doe
s. I didn™t vote any 
special privilege for myself. 
 

Q: When you said that you tried to ma ke life as
 normal as possible, were you shut up from 
the outside world?  Did 
you have any communications? Phone, ma il, radio? 
 

A: No. At one time -- at one time interesti
ng, I -- I had a communication. The company who 
represented votie -- represented from  Estonia,
 and so on, their offices we re in Berlin. A 
company [indecipherable] exterior export and 
import [indecipherable] shaft. And they 
had problems. At one point they had a probl
em with a bank. And some how, I don™t know 
how, a letter was delivered to me  from this
 comp any, in the ghetto. And they™re asking 
one simple thing, if I could help them with th
is particular bank, to straighten it out. So I 

wrote them back, and I told -- and the letter 
was delivered. I wrote them back, and I told 
them with the circumstances we are, that 
I have no way of getting contact with anybody, 
and there nothing what I can 
do, because I am in such and such conditions here. In the 
[indecipherable] I get a letter th
e -- they didn™t know it, and th
ey are very sorry for it. So, 
this whole wa s my contact with them. 
 

Q: Did anybody have radios? 

 

A: There was a fellow what -- Haim Vid ovsky wa
s -- was his name . He listened every day to 
the BBC. Nobody had radios officially, no shu -- 
shu -- should have radio. But he listened 

to the BBC, and they ma de the reports, little 
reports, and a number 
of people get them. I 
was one of them who ge t every morning, a little
 slip of paper, was he picked up from the 
BBC a day before, and so on, so on. There we
re not too ma ny people who get it, but I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
25 
 
was one of them. So this fellow, one day fi
nally came , and how they came  across that he 
is the one who is having the news, and the 
radio and so on, and when he found it out, he 
hanged himself. His name was Haim Vidovsky, and 
he said he didn™t want to fall in life 
in the Germans hand, but if you break down you mi ght s-say some thing. So he took his 
own life. 
 

Q: What kind of infor mation did you get on the radio? 

 

A: [indecipherable] fro m the BBC news  as far 
as the war is concerned, what the Germans 
are doing and so on. They™re -- that they™re no
t doing so well, and so on. And then when 
they -- it was when the front came near to th
e ghetto, the Russian 
stopped, they didn™t 
want to move in. The Russian didn™t want 
to give the Poles the honor of doing some thing 
for themself. So they -- they didn™t go in, a
nd they stopped ahead of time, and this cost 
ma ny lifes, naturally.  
 

Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in the camps? 

 

A: No. We  wer e  kept under information of
 the -- everything voozes -- voo -- who -- who 
were sending out, townswas people, that goi
ng to the cities to work, the German need 
people to work, and they can™t afford to, and 
we don™t have the work here, but they have 
the work in Germany, a nd so -- but nobody 
knew -- I wouldn™t say nobody, I didn™t, 
ma ybe some  people guessed more than they knew. And I came to Auschwitz with the 

same  transport what Roomkofsky c a me .  
 

Q: Were there -- were there 
a lot of transports 
into the Lódz ghetto from differ -- you 
me ntioned a few. 
 

A: In 1941, they transport -- they -- they were from the little ghettos, 
they di -- transport the 
liquidated -- the able bodied people to wor
k, send into the ghetto, there we re not too 
ma ny, they were little, small ghettos. But in
 1942, there came in th
e 5,000 from Vienna, 
five from -- five from Be rlin, and 10,000 Pr
ague. And this was the new -- the newcomers 
that were came in. 
 

Q: Had they cleared some  space for these people? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Had they -- had the author
ities cl eared some space to allow for the new people? 
 

A: They had to take [indecipherable]. They
 had to assign quarters for them, and so on. 
 

Q: But did they have to mo ve certainresidents of Lódz out to ma ke room? 

 

A: No, no, no. They were not group, these persons, wherever there was a place available to 
put them in, and -- and so on.

Q: Were you aware of the Gypsy area? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you provide food for them also? 

 

A: The Gypsies were on the Jewish cemetery, th
ey had Gypsies, and they was hanging them 
there. That™s all we knew from the -- some
 people who worked in the Jewish cemetery, 
who ca me  by and saw that the funeral, so
me thing like it, some body get the word, and 
they were spreading, gave it to some body else
. They are not offici
al knowledge, but you 
knew what they are doing to the Gypsies there. 
 

Q: TheGerman s? 

 

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  

 

Q: So when you me ntion the cemetery, if some
body died in the ghetto, they actually had a 
proper burial? 
 

A: They take him right away to th
e cemetery, and bury them, sure.  
 

Q: Did you -- did the Jewish governme nt provide food for the Gypsies? 

 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know.  

 

Q: Were the Germans in the ghetto, or were 
only the people -- the Jewish police in the 
ghetto? 
 

A: TheGerman s? 

 

Q: Did they come  inside the ghetto? 

 

A: They w -- 

 

Q: TheSS? 

 

A: What kind they were?  They were mostly pe
ople belong to the -- to
 the SS, and criminal 
politsi what the German call and so on. But 
there was no military units as such. Maybe 
there was some  stationed not far, I am sure. But in the ghetto, no.  
 

Q: So the -- the uv -- the SS, and the cr iminal 
police, they stayed outside of the ghetto, and 
they let the Jewish police handle? 
 

A: They were outside, yeah. In the ghetto, they have certain a number of military, I don™t 
know which corps and which ranks, who were just
 to help keep order in it. And they send 
[indecipherable] to the fences, or on the fen
ces. If some body went close to the fence at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
27 
 
evening, they could be shot without asking que
stions, no problem. But there were cases, 
for example, my own experience. I had 
a young lady working in our departme nt, her 
mother was ill, ne ver get out of bed. But in 
order for her to get the soup, she had to be 
registered as a working. Now they lived not fa
r from the fenc e, at a part of the ghetto. 
And there was a time  when -- when -- when
 [indecipherable] knew 
arbudscard, what they 
called, for people who working [indecipherable] 
card. So, then -- and I want to help her, 
she was begging to help my mother. So what 
I did, I went up as close as I could to the 
fence, and showed her to the German soldier there, that I™m here on a mi ssion from t he 
ghetto, go to this and this build
ing there, just to check on 
some thing, and I am comi ng out 
right away back. So he said, ﬁOkay, go ahead.ﬂ 
So I went, and I went in there, and I gave 
her a pass, a working pass, [indecipherable] I 
never saw her. And -- and this was the end, 
then I went out, and I say thank you to him, a
nd I went back. F -- th -- only -- I was only 
a couple times when I went so close to the fe
nce, but I -- I want to help her some thing, 

and I -- it™s the only way I could do it.  
 

Q: So you had a certain amount of these passes you could distribute? 

 

A: No, only for these particular name s. For 
these particular names [indecipherable] with 
anybody else.  
 

Q: But you had one for this lady? 

 

A: I th -- listen, if she was in -- in my de
partme nt, I want to help her mother, so -- 

 

Q: But you were -- but -- but I™m asking is, you 
were able to get a pass for her -- a work 
pass?  
 

A: Yeah, that™s what I delivered to
 her, a pass for that she™s working. 
 

Q: Foryou? 

 

A: For -- yeah, what I delive r to her, a offici
al passport from the -- from the departme nt who 
gave her the passport, that
 she is a working me mber. 
 

Q: Right. I was just asking if you were able to 
get these passes for peopl
e, and say they were 
working for you. 
 

A: No, no, no. 

 

Q: Did you ever go outside the ghetto? 

 

A: Never, never.  

 

Q: So in -- in four years you 
never went outside the ghetto? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
28 
 
A: No. They ghetto was, in other words, inside 
a bridge over the ma in road to the other side 
of the ghetto. You have to go up and go down 
on the other side. The ma in line what was 
Zleerska Street, what goes through, went a
ll the way down. And the Germans were using 
the roads, but we couldn™t pass it. So in or
der to go on the other si
de, you had to go up on 
these stairs and go down the other way.  
 
Q: So the ghetto was cut up, divided? 

 

A: Oh yeah, it was divided, it was divided. Th
e ghetto was both sides. For the old, and for 
the good. 
 

Q: And you couldn™t cross at the 
street because that was -- 
 

A: No way, no, no. There was no way, it wa
s a barbed wire. There was no crossing.  
 

Q: Did some  of the work groups go outside of
 the ghetto, or did everybody work inside the 
ghetto? 

 
A: If-- 

 

Q: Theworkgroups. 

 

A: The work groups? 

 

Q: The work commandoes. 

 
A: The work groups, they went outside the ghetto
 to work. They took them in the morning -- 
not all of them, I™m sure, but this ones what I know, they picked them up in the morning, 
take them outside the ghetto there to 
work, and evening brought them back.  
 

Q: And there were also a lot of factories 
inside? Insi de the ghetto, a lot of workers? 
 

A: Back inside the ghetto, yeah. 

 

Q: Now, were there regular actio
ns, or deportations inside the 
ghetto that ha -- did that 
happen a lot? 
 

A: Oh yeah, that happened quite a bit. The Ge
rman required from Roomkofsky, they want so 
-- so ma ny people out. And so -- so he took people out to varian -- and get people 

together from [indecipherable] from everything they were, and they ma de groups 

wherever they get them, ma de groups to se
nd them out. But they send them out and we 
never knew where they send them, if they sendthem, and so on. So we never heard from 

those people. Wa s at -- at -- at one time  in 
™42, they decided to take children away. And 
then they came  up with the 
idea to take the children to 
a orphan house in Germany. And 
there is the mothers, [indecipherable] the child
ren, very nice, and give
 it to -- give them 
anything, toys, what they can have, and so on. So when they come  to Ge rmany, they can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
29 
 
play in the other kindergarten with all ki
nd of thing, he says oh. Those children were 
taken away, we never heard, and never saw th
em, yeah. After a long time , some  children 
clothing and so on, came  in to be washed in th
e ghetto. I never saw it,
 but this what I was 
told. 
 
Q: When these deportations happened, 
did you get any advanced warning? 
 

A: N-not advanced warning, but they decided they will come and they will [i ndecipherabl e] 
street ma ybe they had against -- I didn™t 
know it, but ma ybe they gi -- of course 
[indecipherable] I am not sure, I don™t know.  
 

Q: Were there certain groups of people who got
 deported first, or -- how did they choose 
who would get deported? 
 

A: Who would get deported?  They choo
se for -- where they took the people 
[indecipherable]. Mostly they try to get rid of
 the -- of people from 
the underworld and so 
on. But they just shoot -- they had to have
 a number of people. And some people were 
[indecipherable] some  pe ople were there, I don
™t know where, but they had no -- there are 
no special selections, or choose who. If 
some body did -- did some thing wrong, he was 
included in [indecipherable] shipme nt. 
 

Q: They didn™t take the wome n first, or the old people? 

 

A: This was a -- we arrived at Auschwit
z. From the ghetto, no. They took everybody who 
was -- not able to do some thing, whatever they could. 
 
Q: So they took people who were not ab
le to work, is that what you say? 
 
A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: Now, my understanding is th
at  after this big aktion with 
the children, and when they s -- 
some ti me  after, I guess 1942, most of the pe
ople in the ghetto were working people, is 
that right?  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did -- wa -- did -- did the admi nistrati
ons change, did the mood change around you? 
 

A: When you say admi nistration, you mean Jewi
sh admi nistration?  No, it was going on the 
same  way. The Jewish -- 
 

Q: They still [indecipherabl e] everythi ng? 

 

A: The Jewish organization tried to keep all 
-- all the factories work
ing. All the factories 
were doing some thing to -- for Germa ny, what 
they needed. And this was the interest. 
And one time the German came up with an idea,
 they -- to -- to build -- frame build 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
30 
 
houses. So they start with a special departme
nt to build houses what can be built and 
transferred to Germany. But this was a big 
thing. And when an in
spection came, and I 
happened to be there when an inspection 
came -- everybody had to be there, so they 
show, so all the people, from the officers,
 and the [indecipherable] saw group of people 
working on it. So when one of the Germans trie
d to pick up such a pi
ece of thing, so it™s -
- it is heavy, how can we do 
it? So there™s a what we ar
e -- the [indecipherable] must 
help. And this is the 
way [indecipherable]  
 
Q: Did they -- when they wanted to ma
ke deportations, would some body come  to your 
office and say, can you spare so ma ny workers, or --  
 

A: No. 

 

Q: That didn™t -- 

 

A: They -- they simple -- they 
gave orders to their departme nts, give me  so and so ma ny 
people. And then this was a ma tter of the in
sight, relation, or fansh
ee, whatever it is, I 
don™t know. I was confronted with this quite
 a few times, and I™m -- I most cases get 
away, not having to -- to comply, but in one
 case, [indecipherable] needed a name. The 
reason?  I knew her sister™s boyf
riend was a bigshot in the -- 
in the Jewish police there, 
and he will get her out. And he did. But so
me body else went. So if you helped anybody, 
you put somebody in. So it was such a -- I me n
tioned wa -- a ex-coworker Mr. Vinerige 

long time ago, he was comi ng in the morning into my office, sitting in the corner. Wa s 

his, nobody else. And finally -- fi
nally he was on one time when they came , and they took 
him away with everybody. Yeah. 
 
Q: So these deportations, they 
were pretty regular from 1942 on? 
 
A: Yeah, they were going on mos
tly regularly. They want to reduce the number of Jews in 
the ghetto, and the liquidation were going on.  
 

Q: You knew people who were taken away? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Did you know ma ny people we
re -- who were taken away? 
 

A: Withwhat? 

 

Q: Did you -- you knew ma ny people who were taken away? 

 

A: From -- from the ghetto? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
31 
 
A: Oh sure. Every time  they took away so
me body, is -- everyone is 
a world for themself. 
And -- but it was -- it was part of the ghe
tto life. And people w
ho were -- somebody was 
taken away from the fa mily, whatever it is, 
after awhile they -- 
lot of people, when 
some body died, they kept the body at home, they 
didn™t report it to di
ed, in order to get 
the food ration card. [indecipherable] cases li
ke it. Although it came to a point where 
death didn™t mean a tragedy. It -- somebody™
s tragedy was some body else™s benefit. The 
morale, sentimentality went through quite a bi g change.  
 
End of Tape #4

Tape #5 
 
Q: I think before we stopped you were talking 
about sort of a stra
nge -- sort of a new 
morality, because people had unusual choices, so
 that people dying mi ght be a blessing to 
some body else. Any -- any other thoughts 
you have on that? Any other examples? 
 

A: People just kept the bodies at home, they didn
™t -- they didn™t get them buried, in order to 
-- they would -- to get the f
ood ration, whatever it is.  
 

Q: From your office, your food dist
ribution was to centers, not to 
individuals, is that right? 
 

A: Yes. From my office, you see, we ha
d distribution of f
ood, was -- was special 
department, Sheesheesky, what I mentioned to 
you before. And he figur
ed out we have so 
much food, we have so ma ny heads, this we 
can do. And this is th
e way it was assigned. 
Although this was not exactly what the 
German thought we should give everybody 
whatever it is. Did we have more, we  have mo re potatoes, so we give mor e . If we -- was 

a time, whatever get, we get a lot of shipme
nt of potatoes, this was helping, naturally. 
This way people could get a little bit more. 
But the [indecipherable] 
plants, the -- the -- 
the season, how much to give was based on th
e available food, and the number of heads 
in the ghetto. 
 

Q: But toward the end, towards 1944 -- 

 

A: ™44. 

 

Q: -- the ghetto was much smaller, wasn™t it? 
 
A: In ™44, the ghetto was smaller. The ghetto opened up, I don™t reme mber exactly, with 
160,000 over there with the -- I th
 -- reme mber how much it came to the ghetto. Then, lot 
of people went to Wa rsaw, and -- because ther
e they were relatives, whatever it is, and 
they hoped Warsaw will not have such a t
ough time like Lódz, so -- so they went. So it 
was -- fluctuated, and we never knew ex
actly how ma ny people we have. The food 
departme nt, the Sheesheesky departme nt kne
w how much talons he™s giving out. But 
that™s about all. 
 

Q: Okay, so what -- so what happened to you next?   

 

A: Well, next what?   

 

Q: Well, is there anything else you want to te
ll me  about the ghetto, or do you want to tell 
me  how you happened to leave it? 
 

A: And what -- and with the ghetto, do you have 
any specific questions I 
mi  -- I think I know 
quite about the ghetto. There were the departme
nt of working, and lot of people who after 
the war immigrated, gave different recollection, 
different thing. And this mostly cut in in 
my period from after the war in Germany. Wh
en we were liberated from the camps, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
33 
 
idea was I knew at this time  the [indeciphera
ble] 19 people, whatever it is. Anyway, and I 
thought I will try to do what I can to help. This
 is what was -- what 
it is. Not having an 
idea how ma ny there are. There were a lot 
of -- more people than we expected. And 
different people came to work with us, and so
 on, so on. And some  people -- but in a case 
like this, in a time like this, not in a case,
 the people who have 
more experience with 
doing illegalities, are betteractive doing some thing. For example, we have -- we -- I 

organized the office to help people from con
centration camp i n Germany after the war. 
What you call vicasette Auschwitz. Officially
 I am with hauptaushus [indecipherable] 
with a haftlinger. And this -- came in a fellow,
 and then there wa -- in the concentration 
camp, there were green winkles, and red winkl
es. The green were criminals, red was 
political. No -- nothing -- he had a ma n worki
ng with us by the name  of Geerob Ganda he 
passed away. And he was a green winkle,
 criminal. But he belonged to a youth 
organization who worked anti-Hitler, and th
ey made -- they rob banks, and some  of 
whatever they could. And one time he [indeci
pherable], he was in the [indecipherable] 
and he was stamped with the criminal winkle. 
But his explanation, I have it from hi m, his 
explanation was he did it for the group, what 
tried to help the -- [indecipherable] other 
people. He did -- after the war he had to run aw
ay, had to -- we nt to Israel, he went back, 
came back. He died in Hanover. And so this 
fella knew how to handl
e those cases. Was a 
-- even -- Ge-Germans basically
 would like to benefit, and 
when they have connection 
with a -- with a office, with a conshertoes, and 
they were able to get 
a little bit different 
food on certain occasions, they went all for it
. So -- but all those people who were in the 
camps as -- as political, they were actually fr
om political  activities
. A lot of people who 
were fr om the criminal thing were political  
in whatever  thei r actions. So, is the -- the 
[indecipherable] they forget to take the bot 
for. And for this Geerab Ganda, he knew so 
much from t he [indecipherable] that I was in
clined to believe him. He was able to 
ma nage the German™s authorities to give us more food, more this, more this. He was able 
to do it.  
 
Q: Well, let™s go back. 

 

A: Yes,ma ™am.  

 

Q: We ™ve jump ed a little bit to after the 
war. You stayed in the ghetto how long?   
 

A: We -- I went to the ghetto in the 
beginning, after my father™s death in 17
th
 of January. 
 

Q: 1940? 

 

A: Then I was t -- 1940 -- then they came in and gave me  10 mi nutes to leave the house, and 
only take what I can. And 
I left the ghetto on the 28
th
 of August, 1944. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  how that came about, you leaving the ghetto? 

 

A: Oh yeah. They were -- we  were [indeciphe
rable] getting out of 
the ghetto, they were 
setting transport every day to send out. And 
there -- there was -- they
 decided to liquefy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
34 
 
the ghetto, and just leave about 50,000 people 
to do the cleaning wa -- to clean up, or 
something like it. 
 
Q: Howma ny?  

 

A: 50,000. This was at this time  they estima te 50,000 Jews to leave there to do the cleaning 
job after everybody left. And so 
they took -- if the numbers ar
e right, but this is the 
numbers we were given. Not 50,000, but 50 peopl
e, pardon me. Skip the thousands. I™m 
sorry. And so it was at  this time they were 
organizing transports every day, and it came to 
this, my transport left on the 28
th
. 
 

Q: Did they tell you where you were going? 

 

A: No. They loaded it in the 
-- close the transport cars, no wi
ndows or nothing, put us in as 
ma ny as they could, pushed in, lock the door, 
and that™s it. And we didn™t know anything. 
I didn™t know where we are going. Nobody knew. Ha
d a lot of people --  not lot of, but a 
few people suffocated there. And they died there, in it. No, we came after, and I don™t -- 

at this time I lost the count of time, if it was a day or two, when they fi nally -- when it 

came to a point and they opened the gate a
nd let us out. So then, this was Auschwitz. 
 

Q: What did it look like? 

 

A: Was [indecipherable] was a reception, a big 
field. And we had to go down from -- from 
the cars, leave everyt hing in the cars what we
 are left -- what we ha
ve left, just go down 
and for m two lines, me ns one side, wome n to 
the other side. And then, on the head of it 
stood the German, the fa mous -- oh boy, and he 
ma ke selection, with the finger. Right, 
left, right, left. The right wh
at he assume d were good to wor k. To me  he hesitates for a 
little while, but put me  to the right, to the wo rking. And to the -- and the -- they -- they 

did the same  thing to the wome n™s line, t
oo. And the one who were taken to the left, 
never heard about them, I don™t know. 
 

Q: Who -- who else went with you? 

 

A: When we came to Auschwitz, 
was my sister, and my wife.  

 

Q: Who else went with you 
to Auschwitz, to this -- 
 

A: To Auschwitz?  My si -- my 
wife and my sister, Rachel.  
 

Q: And what happened when you all 
lined up, what happened to them?  
 

A: They lined up -- I was in one line, and the 
wome n was in the -- in the other line. And this 
here the last time when we -- when we saw each
 other. We  looked at each other, but we 
had to move , move, move, move. And this th
e way it was. And never saw before, never 
saw after. It ™s the last time. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
35 
 
Q: Were there other prison
ers around when you arrived? 
 
A: No. We didn™t see it, but la
ter when we went in, and we we
re taken through the halls to 
wash, to be shaved, to clean our [indeciphe
rable] then there were some prisoners 
working, who were there before, work
ing in a establishments there.  
 

Q: What were you thinking this was all -- 

 

A: Pardonme ?  
 
Q: What did you think this was all about? 

 

A: Whatwas? 

 

Q: What did you think of all of this? 

 

A: What I think this?  Yeah, no thinking at 
all at this time, you don™t think. You following 
the certain way of life, a
nd thinking -- no, I don™t thi
nk anybody want to think, and 
nobody was thinking. We  knew this is nothing pl
easant for us, and what will ha ppen, who 
knows?  Roomkofsky wa s with the same  train. They took him off, his father and adopted 

son, and so on, and they put him in a van. I saw them take it into the van. He came  to 

Auschwitz with letters of re-recommendation fro
m Veevofe to treat him well. So this way 
he was taken to a van. This is a van, when 
they start to move, gas comes in, and they 
suffocated. I don™t meet -- I didn™t meet a
nybody who ever saw Room
kofsky afterwards. 
So, this was the answer to me  about Roomkofsky.  
 
Q: When he went in the van, though, you didn™
t know it was a gas van at the time, did you? 
 
A: No, but I saw a special type of van, and so
 my a ssumption was this is the end of it.  
 

Q: So after you were chosen to go to the right, what happened next? 

 

A: Then we were taken to Auschwitz and gi
ven numbers. They -- in 1944 was the last time 
they tattooed numbers, they didn™t have any 
time  to do it. My number was 52962, a little 
me tal tag, and it was a sh -- painted on on this
 uniform, 52962, this is my number, under 
this number I was known, there no name . And -- a
nd then we were sent, the first transport 
what we were sent was a thousand people what
 were sent to continue [indecipherable] 

worker to the rubber factory. 
 

Q: So how long did you stay in Auschwitz? 

 

A: In Auschwitz?  I would say the mo
st five days. I don™t think any more. 
 

Q: So you didn™t work or anythi
ng there, any [indecipherable] 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
36 
 
A: Oh no, in Auschwitz I didn™t work at all. Ju
st trying to get out of there. The smell in 
Auschwitz was not bearable. 
 
Q: Why?  

 

A: Burned flesh, burning everything. Came  on 
from Birkenau, where 
the -- where the gas 
chambers were. 
 

Q: And you knew what that was? 

 

A: Yeah, and they know about -- there was us 
people what they take to work. And then 
when they called -- when they call who is 
a -- for example, a carpenter, everybody was a 
carpenter. When they call whatever it is, ever
ybody is a specialist. For this arrangeme nt, 
some  people ma de it, some  people, I don™t know. 
 

Q: So how did they choose you to go out? 

 

A: Oh, to work?   

 

Q: Wait, let me  just ask a question, what -- 

 

A: They sent a group of thousand people, and 
I was in the area count 
a thing -- a thousand 
people, it was not a individual choice, it was 
a count of thousand peopl
e, you were there.  
 

Q: Okay, so what happened, what did -- what did -- 

 
A: And then we were sent to continue 
[indecipherable] work, as I said, continue 
[indecipherable] work -- employed people from
 -- from conce ntration camps. And the SS 
get paid for, they didn™t do it. So we were
 sent there, but they 
need -- there was a camp 
set up not far, three miles, ma ybe two miles,
 so we could walk every night home, and 
every night go back to -- and every day go back
 to work. There were 12 Polish, they did -

- 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: -- they couldn™t tattoo any more, I th
ink the last time they tattoo was ™44.  
 

Q: Okay, so you got to [indecipherable] 

 

A: Okay, then we wer -- then we went there, in
 the -- in a [indeciphera
ble] they have set up a 
camp not far , to be the barracks for us, and we
 had to work in the factory there. Now the 
factory was -- was producing all 
kind of rubber goods for the 
Germans, and the -- and the 
ma in thing was to produce [indecipherable
] for tiles. So the rubber was comi ng down 

from the third floor, liquid, and came on the cu
rrent floor, and there were big machines 
turning the thing, and -- and they get harden, 
and we had to carve them with knives to 

ma ke pieces of them, so they can go through again, and so on. Now, they were mostly -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
37 
 
they were civilian workers too, who worked
 with it, mostly Poles. The Poles were 
comi ng into work every time , in shift. They
 leave [indecipherable] 
far, but they were 
brought in to work, and so on. 
 
Q: Let me  ask you where was this factory? 

 

A: In Hanover. It™s a big, big territory. 

 

Q: Was it a sub-camp of a l a rger camp, or not? 

 

A: What, the camp? 

 

Q: Was it -- this -- the -- the factory was 
separate, it was a German factory, yes? 
 

A: A Ger man factory. 

 

Q: Was -- were your barracks part of
 any -- you need to sit back, please. 
 

A: Oh, pardon me. 

 

Q: Were -- were your barracks part of any 
larger concentration camp, was it a sub-camp? 
 

A: No, no. We  were all part of Neuengamme
, all the camps around the area belonged to -- 
they had -- the headquarter of Neuengamme, in 
the area. So -- and we 
were part of it. So 
we were there, and we had to work two shifts. Now, working on the shifts, cutting the 

rubber with the -- the Poles who were comi ng th
ere, the Poles, they were volunteers to 
work, and so on, they get gloves, and things to
 protect themself, we didn™t get it. So we 

have to some what burn the fi nger, burn the fi nger. So when he will cutting it, try to do 

the best  of the thing like this. And this tim
e, somehow, I attracted the attention of a g-
German ma s t er, who was going around s
ee how everybody is doing, and he spoke 
German, and I know German, so we get in 
-- in a little conversa
tion, and -- and he 
became interested, and vi sit me as often as he could. At one time, th -- and then he comes 

in one time  and tells me  he -- he is being tr
ansferred, and if I need anything what -- what 
he can help me , I should contact him. I sa
id, ﬁOkay, who are you, where should I contact 
you? ﬂ So there was a running sign around in th
e office there, Herr towans commarada 
edisnow pay. The -- the ma n 
who the -- the trusted men fr om the National Socialistic 
Party is he [indecipherable] me . But later on 
he confide to me  he was never a Nazi, he 
never belonged to coo -- but this was his job 
with the factory, he worked there for ma ny 
years. So then one time, during, I think, yea
h, then in seven -- we worked on ma chines -- 
they were special machines to ma ke amon, a
nd this happened with -- and I finished my  
shift, and we were taken back to the barrack
s. After a little while, a SS man came to the 
room and called my number. So, come. So 
I go. Followed him back to the factory. And 

turned out to be they had a few machines working upstairs, and the machines jumped 

some how, they couldn™t ma ke the m go. Th
ere was a -- a German master, and his 
assistant, and they couldn™t ma ke the m
achines go. I was working on this type of 
machines five at a time, and I knew the machines. Because the Poles came , and they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
38 
 
going hiding, and I worked for them. So they gave  me  a piece of bread once in awhile. So 
-- then -- so I come there, and then -- and 
they™re stuck in the work, and they couldn™t 

ma ke the m, and the ma ster come s up, and his 
eyes, you could see right away, he™s not a 
friend of mi ne. And he told me , ﬁYou know how
 to work these machines? ﬂ  I say, ﬁYes, I 
know.ﬂ ﬁDo you know how to work one machine?
ﬂ I say yes. ﬁGo work.ﬂ I went, put up a 
machine. After I let the mach
ine go, I didn™t ask any question, put up another machine. I 
was working, and they were looking, and they 
work with their machines, and trying to fix 
it. I had it that this night I am workin
g on three machines the same ti me, some 
[indecipherable] and they couldn™t make their ow
n machine go. So this --  this aggr avat ed 
them very, very much. Okay by then the morning, we had to go back and come  back, I 

had to wait -- no, I didn™t go back. They told me  you stay here, lie down for a couple 

hours, then you™re back to your shifts. Okay. 
This was [indecipherable]. So then I didn™t 
see him, this friend of my, I seen him for 
a long, long time. One time I ge -- daytime, an 
SS ma n ca me in to the iddel, and called my
 number. And I was wo
rking. Come. I had to 
follow him. So I followed him to a big, big o
ffice, a long table where there sitting ma ybe 
12 or 16 people around the -- around the table th
ere. They we re probably given a positive 
information about me , that I can help, and 
they were trying to set me  up for a good job 
for -- for after the war. So, first of all they 
give me  a chair to sit down, and had a little 
conversation in German, just to check my Ge
r man. So we™re talking. Then finally they 
came to the point, that is my 
knowledge of Ger man, and with 
my experience in this work, 
I can build up myself a great career for afte
r the war, and work w
ith them, and do it -- 
help them [indecipherable] and so on. So I was very pleased, I was -- thank you for the 

acknowledgement, and -- and polite convers
ation, and I was dismissed not knowing 

exactly what there is [indecipherable]. There is
 [indecipherable] they wanted to train me  
as a knowledgeable ma n who helped to run th
e machines, and all kind of things. I was 
transferred to the upper pl
ace where all the rubber were
 mi xed. I was very little 
[indecipherable] but ma ny other things. And th
ere with was everythi
ng what you put in in 
the cooking machine wa s -- made me -- I wa 
-- black up and down, I couldn™t wash it out 
for weeks. See, the question there [indecipherabl
e], but at the time  this -- and when this 
was going on for -- for quite awhile until 
November 30. November 30, 1944. Nove mber 
30 they came up and told us the departme nt is not happy with all of you, so we are going 

to transfer you to -- to a 
different. And the office was a 
walking distance, probably an 
hour. We walked to a place called Ahlen. Ahle
n was a -- a ex-asphalt mi ne. There was 
not acting -- nothing there. They wanted to crea
te a factory in this 
asphalt mi ne, so it has 
to be dynamited, put hole to dynamite, explode it
, take out all the j
unk, all that, and so on, 
so on. And ma ke it clear, which [indecipherable]
 this. And finally they came  to the point 
when is clear enough, and they wanted to set 
up -- so we worked with dynamite, with all 
kind of things for the Germans. And [indecipherable] and every time  to -- to take out, 

push up, blows up, and so at one time there was -- I am pushing up and I™m -- and I™m 

trying to go back, with pushing oh -- not by 
myse lf, with a few other people, and the 
German watch ma n was -- wa-was saying, give 
it back to me . [indecipherable], so I say, 
ﬁGere shtatin zeebeeta.ﬂ Gere shtatin is a nice German expression for please, excuse me . 

He tells, ﬁOh, bitte, bitte.ﬂ From this time we became buddies. Every time I pass by he 

want to have a conversation w
ith me . And we were talking a lot, and he was put in -- he 
was out of the army, service a long time , but 
they needed a young people for the front, so 

they took all the -- all the la -- people, put th
em in the SS to guard 
the camps. This is the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
39 
 
way it was. And this was going on until we cl eare d the outside  mi ne, ma de fl oors, ma de a 
factory, and then -- and put in machinery, so 
they started to work, for this daily, daily 
hard work. 
 

Q: This camp Ahlen, this was also a s
ub-camp of Neuengamme?  Also part -- 
 

A: Yeah, oh yeah. Every -- all the camps 
were, they were part of Neuengamme. 
Neuengamme was the head camp for the whole te
rritory, for the -- all the a -- other. The 
Neuengamme h-head office was in Hamburg, I think. 
 

Q: How were your living conditions? 

 

A: The living condition were excellent. We had 
the coffee pot in the morning to -- in -- in 
the rag -- the -- they 
brought in a big jar with coff
ee, and ma de sure that everybody 
receives coffee. Then they turned around 
the whole cage on the floor, and we had to 
scrub the fl oor with the coffee. Sometime 
we get the coffee [indecipherable], some time 

not. But this the way life was. And then this 
-- and then we went to work, on these floors. 
 

Q: Where -- did -- how ma ny people were in your barracks?  

 

A: In the -- in each barracks there were -- 
there were a few barracks. In -- in -- in each 
barrack there was about 30 
- 32 people, and so on.  
 

Q: You have beds? 

 

A: The wa -- yeah, there was a bunk you could lay down. Two story. 
 
Q: All by yourself? 

 

A: But -- but you could lay down, yeah. And -- 

 

Q: You get food later on? 

 

A: And food then -- then -- at work we -- 
we had to go for lunch and get food, and so on, 
yeah. The soup -- this -- the -- mo- most of 
the food was of a soup. Could hardly find a 
piece of potato there, but listen, this is the one 
we have, and this -- we have to survive, to 
go on with. 
 

Q: Was this camp only me n?  Only me n worked here? 

 

A: Only men, only men. 

 

Q: About how -- how ma ny me n?

Tape #6 
 
A: Talking about the Germans, I knew Germany 
fr om before the war. Etiquette is nice, 
excellent people, and so on. This type, let™s 
say for example, the -- the cassette Auschwitz 
what we organize was th -- to help people 
from concentration camp. One day come s in a 
German farmer, and gives me a bill, and want me  to pay it, for potat oes he deliver ed to 

the SS. So I tell, oh, and what happened to
 the potatoes?  You people ate it, so why 
shouldn™t you pay for?  This was their me ntalit
y. Basically, they were
 jealous people. If 
some body had some thing, they want and so on. I had one time -- I -- 
 

Q: Are you talking about after the war now? 

 

A: Yeah, after the war. 

 

Q: Oh,okay. 

 

A: I had -- one time, I had no car, and there we
re no car to get some where. One time comes 
to me  a German, and sa y, ﬁI know where a car is,ﬂ
 and tells me  of a far mer that he has in 
his thing hidden, covered up a car. The followi
ng there I went over there, a few people, 
and we took home  the car. But this is char
acteristic for them, they were jealous of 
another, and if some body had some thing, they
 liked to have it, too. So it was a --a 
different type of experience with Germans 
between these two groups of German. I cannot 
tell in -- tell the different gr
oups that different people out of
 different groups, whatever it 
is, but this is the way it is.  
 

Q: So let™s go back a mi nute to Ahlen. 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: And also I know you had -- you seemed to ha
ve conversations and contact with Germans 
there, also at continental [indecipherable]. 
How much informa tion were you getting about 
what was happening in the war?   
 

A: What was happening in the war?  Nothing. 
This is a point I never touched. I was only 
interested if he could help me  to find out 
what will happen next to us. So he told 
[indecipherable], tomorrow I will let you know. A
nd next time  when he came to lead us 
to the toc, he told me the -- the --  the cam
p is to be set for evacuation on the sixth of 
April. But from the outset what happen, I neve
r we nt in with any German, no ma tter how 
friendly, in politics. Wa s a dangerous area, and I 
stood away from it. I j -- so this is -- the 

only thing was that  I fi nd out for him when the camp will be evacuated. And the camp 

was evacuated officially on Friday, April the 
sixth, 1945. And then when -- then you see, 
the -- the camp was in the mi ddle of a field. People were going by Sundays for walks, and 

so was going on and so. There were nobody w
ho didn™t know what™s going on. But when 
the camp was evacuated on April the sixth, 
the evacuated, I mean that  the marching 
people went, and we were left who -- w
ho couldn™t walk, or couldn™t ma rch. Then, 
people from all sides came in, disconnected el
ectrical wiring from
 -- from -- from the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
41 
 
fences, and trying to be nice and help us, they
 brought in coffee. We  says, okay. But then 
our young people, very unpatient, run out, st
art to go around, look. And I begged them 
don™t go, the German are still around some wher
e. What happened we don™t know. No, we 
know we are here tomor -- and on the followi
ng day, Saturday, came an SS ma n with a 
truck, and loaded us on the truck, we we
re 19 people from this camp. And these 19 
people, [indecipherable] drove us to a place cal
led the Shizenplatz. The Shizenplatz was a 
place where the German SS were leaving  thei r officers, and everythi ng and so on. So, he 
drove us there, and there before the gate isa general, a professiona
l, looks almost gray, 
standing. And here Plotsam and I wa s on the tr uck. Here Plotsam, he get that here was 

some  19 people for execution. And the genera
l told him, ﬁLook, we are killing people in 
a war, but we are not killing people who -- 
who -- who we™re not fighting. Your friends 
left already.ﬂ So he told us to go off the tr
uck, and he told the [i
ndecipherable] and he™s 
all off. So™s the last I saw about him -- of
 him. Not far away was a French POW ca mp, 
and they mo tioned to us to come  close to them
. And this was a big -- a big help to us. So 
we went over there, and they told us, ﬁLook, you never know if the Germa n come  back or 

not. This unifor m is not good. You have to go change uniforms.ﬂ I said okay, how, 

where?  So, ﬁThis is a little building there, 
break in. There are the uniforms what we are 
wearing.ﬂ So I took my people, and we walk 
in there, and we took uniform, changed the 
uniforms, and put them in and joined them
. They would be very -- they were very 
helpful. They were tryi ng to help us with li
ttle bit what they had, but they didn™t have too 
much either. So -- it was a -- a certain t
ype of a good experien
ce in bad times.  
 

Q: What happened next? 

 

A: Next this was -- this al ready wa
s the next ist day on We dnesday, the 11
th
 of April. A lady 
comes running in, and say there are Ameri
canos in the areas, be the American 
[indecipherable]. So, naturally I 
got the courage to go. So we we
nt to center of the town, 
and there I saw the American tanks, first time
 I saw them, sa w on the -- the lemt . And so 
I up -- I approached the officer in charge there 
where it was, and I told them as far as I 
knew we are 19 people, and we need some  assistance, we don™t know what to do. So he -- 
talking a little bit German, a li
ttle bit -- he must have been Je
wish, too, or -- or he -- or he 
knew a little bit more [indecipherable]. So he to
ld me to be the liais
on, that he cannot talk 
to all 19 people, but a be -- and he appointed me -- gave me a piece of paper, so I can 

walk after the time where is walking not permitted. And so then try to keep informed. 

Then we went to a pl ace there were pe ople 
there sitting down, that we were actually 
housing. Still, ours had benches and so on, so 
on. And there we were sitting, and evening 
American soldiers came to visit us. And ther
e -- pardon me  -- and there where it was -- 
thank you -- and there where it was, my firs
t disappointme nt, what 
it is?  We are sitting, 
black soldiers, white soldiers. Comes in a whit
e soldier, shakes hands with every white, 
not with the black. No, it didn™
t slide good with me, but there™
s the way it is, I don™t what 
to think. That™s the way it was. And they -- 
the black people didn™t see anything abnormal 
in it. This was the life what they had. Then, among them was  a fellow asked me  if I ha ve 

some body i n New York, I say, ﬁSure, I have 
a sister in New York.ﬂ ﬁDo you reme mb er 
where she live?ﬂ I gave him -- yeah, gave him the a -- the address. His wi fe lived a 

couple blocks from there. He notified his wi
fe, and he went away, I never saw him again. 
But he notify -- later, I found out when I came 
to the States, he notified his wife, and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
42 
 
contacted my sister. I never saw even the mo -- the units went off, so [indecipherable]. 
And this was -- we were sitting there, a
nd trying to house the -- and we had to eat 
some thing, so we found them whole rice, cages 
of rice. I never cooked 
rice in my life. I 
didn™t know when you put in a littl
e bit, it grows up, [indecipherab
le]. So I put in a little 
bit, and I got plenty of it, but
 this is -- the first time you le
arn, next time , do better. And 
this is where life is -- sl owly went back until
 we were able to resettle from there. We  
settled in -- in -- in -- in Hanover 
hims elf, in the town, and so on. 
 

Q: Did they find you housing in Hanover? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Did the military find you housing?  

 

A: No, no, no, they were -- we sa -- went into 
town, and wherever apartments available, we  
get in. And there were ma ny apartme nts availa
ble. And we we re not 
-- we were only 19 
people, so wa s not a big deal. And some  of th
em are still live in Germany. There was my 
experience in camp, the doctors. There was a -- 
a sickum, what they 
called, and there was 
a doctor, a fellow who I knew from ghetto, who 
-- he did one year to graduate me dical 
school from -- from Italy, but he was only 
a shop. In the ghetto, he was working as a 
doctor. He was very smart, and very know
ledgeable. Dr. Faglovitch, his name  now is 
Fago. And the -- the order -- yeah, was a -- th
en there was a Dr. Vondaykunt in Belgium, 
picked up on the street, send him away to th
e camp, his fa mily never knew where he is, 
what he is. This I found out after the war wh
en they came looking for him. So -- but he 
was a doctor, and he became ill one time, hims
elf, to the Je wish Dr. Faglovitch, who was 

not a [indecipherable] doctor to
ld the German he had typhus. 
What are you talking, what 
di-did you know about typhus?  So, not -- they 
went away, it™s not typhus. Then he get 

worse, so I called [indecipherable] they --they brought a doctor from outs i de, a German 

doctor from outside, and he says, yeah, that 
was typhus. It was too la
te already, couldn™t 
save him any more. Later on I find out more about him because the family came to look 

for him, and some how they were directed to me , said ma ybe I knew something more 

about, but I was in the same  group, and so on, and so on.  
 

Q: Okay, well let™s -- tell me a little bit a
bout what you did with this freedom you finally 
had. 
 

A: What-- 

 

Q: What -- what were you doing 
at this point?  You were -- 
 

A: When? 

 

Q: After the war. 

 

A: After the war -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
43 
 
Q: -- you™re in Hanover. 
 

A: I organized the -- the office of the cartsertosi
ous. This means to help -- to help the contact 
with all people, with the Germans. There was 
no way that th -- a su rvivor and a Germa n 
could get together without a fight. Ne ver happe
n. And I had to avoid this. And what we 
did at this time, the German authorities ha
d orders from the American, then from the 
British to help us towelon to look for people.
 So everybody ha d to get a -- 10 ma rk, and a 
[indecipherable] to buy food and so on I get th
is. And tried to tasse
r. She was one of 
them, she was going looking for -- for her mother.  
 

Q: Estelle? 

 

A: And -- and pe -- yeah. And people, they 
are going. So I saw the -- how do you do when 
they have to work to the Germans, sign for 
the thing, get a card. It
 didn™t work out. I saw 
this would be murder. So I told them, ﬁO
kay, look, why don™t you give me  the cards, the 

money, and I will de liver you the following day [indecipherable] compla cent.ﬂ And this -

- and this work this way. So I was every day 
what I was paid ousen to. I gave them a list 
with the si gnatures, and they repl aced 
me  the mo ney with the things on it, 
[indecipherable] looking, couldn™t even. So 
this way we -- we had the cardset office 
working to help people as much as possible.  
 

Q: Now, were you in a -- you were in a central office in Hanover, and people found out 
about you?  
 

A: We -- we -- yeah, we organized [indecipherabl
e] office, in middle of it on -- was a empty 
few rooms, and -- and this is well known, if
 I -- the way I™m all pe
ople [indecipherable] 
they are. I [indecipherabl e] if 
there was -- if ther e is time fo
r it, for a little episode. The 
British relief -- first were American, came in 
from HIAS, from the other groups, and Joint 
help. Then came  the British relief in, who took 
over. And they were -- in the British was 
a rabbi Dr. Monk, who kept with me  a contact, 
mostly of religious things, what he want, 
where anybody needs some thing, so on, so on. And one time he come s for me , and s a ys -

- I take away your time with it? Am I take away your time with it? 
 

Q: It™s okay -- it™s okay. 

 

A: And one time he -- he come s to me , a nd 
say he has to go for two weeks to London, and 
gives me  a telephone number, if something 
-- I will need something with a religious 
thing, to call this number. So a fella came  up 
a couple days later, a 
Polish dressed officer, 
a doctor on -- on a motorcycle, and say he™s ac
tually a Jew, and he want to go back to 

Judaism. So, ﬁLook, I cannot help you, but I 
have a number I will call.ﬂ So I call the 
number, and the following day, a tall Britisher came, like the British, with -- he was 

driving a Jeep, and the driver with him was sittin
g next to it, like the British offi cer, with 
a shpitzel, with all kind of things. And he 
came and he said, ﬁDid you call for me ? ﬂ  I say 
yes. And he didn™t look to be Jewish wh
atsoever, I don™t know. And he looked ver -- 
there are -- there are no such things like the 
Jewish look. And then he came , and then he 
says yes, and I told him what the problem is. He told him have the fellow come  in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
44 
 
tomorrow mor -- tomorrow evening, and this time I will be here. So I ma de an 
arrangement, and they came  the following 
day -- afternoon. And they were sit down, and 
th -- and -- and I told them, ﬁLook, 
I don™t have to be with you at
 this time, this is a thing 
with you to -- with hims elf. So when you go, ju
st ma ke sure the door is locked.ﬂ Nothing 

important of -- I fi nd out the following day that
 they will si tting until late in the night, 
tolnote that  the Polish captain who came  wa
s a scion of a rabbinical family, and the 
British officer was a scion of a rabbinical fa
mily. His name was Herzog. And I think this 
is the fu -- this was the future president. 
And people tell me , why did they call him, why 

did they contact him?  Look, I am not looki
ng for glory, for acknowledgeme nt. I did my 
job, and I thought I am doing the right 
thing, and that™s it. [inaudible]  
 

Q: How large of an operation did you have in Hanover? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: How large of an operation was this in Hanover? 

 

A: In Han -- the operation, how l
ong it was?  Until I left Hanover. 
 

Q: Well no, how big was it?   

 

A: Oh, it was -- we had an office, we had afew people with different departme nts, legal 
departme nt. People came with a -- problems to register, and so on. And then a lot of 

people who came in, and had to register as
 -- you could only help people who survived 
camps, or some -- something like it, but you 
couldn™t give help, by law, to anybody else. 
And there were -- and there were a lot of 
people who needed assist ance or whatever in 
the camps, because they were -- they were hidde
n, they were this, they were all kinds, a-
all -- all kind of things. So we try to acco
mmodat e , help them as much as possible. 
 

Q: Were you under the supervision of the military? 

 

A: It was under the supervision of our
 office, over the [indecipherable].  
 

Q: But did you have to answer to th
e military governmen
ts, or anything? 
 

A: No, not at all. I only had to do the legal th
ings, nothing to do agai
nst the [indecipherable], 
so we confiscated a big building, a big hous
e which was empt y, and the transports, and 
the Jewish brigade was bringing in people fr
om the outside, over the border and so on. 
So, to ma ke it either [indecipherable] came up 
and ask me  for -- for passports -- we had 
documents what we signed with the stamp, and this is a legal document. So I gave them 

200 such ve -- different things
 what they wanted, and with these papers they were 
transferring people forth and b
ack. It was a -- a thing, and a time hard to imagine now, 

but it worked.  
 

Q: But you got the money fr om the governme nt? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345

A: And the governme nt paid for the 10 dolla
rs for each one and so on. The governme nt 
didn™t pay anything -- yeah, we
 get salaries from the govern
ment. I would a -- salary --  
 
Q: Fromwhichgovernme nt? 

 

A: From the Ge rman authorities. The German -- they -- they had to pay our salary. We  had a 
office that was five, six people, so 
-- so we get salary from them.  
 

Q: And the American and the Brit
ish were not involved in this? 
 

A: In this operation, nothing whatsoever.  

 

Q: How long did you do this?  How long did you do this work? 

 

A: Until I left Germany. I left Germany on the 28
th

sister were still okay? 
 

A: I knew, and I find out people what my brot

 of Kovno, Kovno is in Lithuania, and was 
going over from her -- there that few times, and everybody who came kne w I was always 
interviewing, I want to find [indecipherable
] come. I find out very soon that when the 
German ca me  in the second time, they took all the me n and shot them out. So I know I 
div -- didn™t have anybody.  
 

Q: So you never went back to Lódz? 

 

A: What for?  Poland?  No. No. 

 

Q: So in 1950 you decided to come  to the United States?

Q: Well, how did you meet -- where did Es

A: Estelle came into picture in Bergen-Bel

time came to me in Germany an American 
offi cer, and said his grandmother is from

Lódz, Poland, and she looking for relatives, and 
he told me  the last name . I said I don™t 
know anybody here with this name . But there is 
not far from here is a big camp, Berge n-
Belsen, and there mi ght be people there, I 
don™t know. If you want
, I will get a jomo n 
diver and he was take us there. And this I ca
lled up and diver came in to us to there, to 
cross to Bergen-Belsen. And we parked the car 
in the mi ddle of the yard, and I get out of 
the car, I heard her voice, Mr
. Klipp is here. In Polish, natu
rally. And so this -- then -- 
then we saw the fi rst time after war, and we were in the ghetto, where she was working 
for the departme nt, and this the way it was, 
this is the first enc
ounter after the war.  
 

Q: Now, I know that you ha d testified at 
some military trials 
in [indecipherable] 
 

A: I -- I testified in 1947 before
 a military tribunal, British. Ther

and for thing -- what of them. He was [i
ndecipherable]. He was a well known Ger ma n 
soccer pl ayer, and this why he get the job there. So he was one of them, and then there 

were others, some  SS men, some  from Ukra
inian region, some  other, so on. And there 
was one for -- especially from
 the Ukrainian region, was a terrible guy with a big dog and 
so on. Anyway, I came to this, and the point wa s to get the testimony to find out. And this 

fellow by himself, the soccer pl ayer, to 
my knowledge, didn™t 
do anything personally 
wrong to anybody, which I witnessed. And they 
ask me  the question, I told them no. I 
didn™t see anythi -- him doing it. But he wa
s responsible. And this why he™s get the 
sentence. The fellow, the SS ma n from Ukra
inian region, with the big dog, he get the 

death sentence, and some other peop
le get sentences, years and so on. 
 

Q: What was the name  of the soccer player? 

 

A: Ofthe? 

 

Q: Soccerplayer. 

 

A: Soccer player?  To -- Todd. I think Todd. He™s a good person, you know, never

reme mber any more, don™t remembe r  any more. 
 

Q: So you came to the United States in 1950.

Canada went to New York. We  arrived in New York on the 28

Q: You didn™t have any problem getting a visa to come over? 
 

A: No, the vi -- there was a ma ss visa, there we
re no individual visa. That wa s for the whole 
group of survivors. We  were a full ship of people like me .  
 

Q: What do you think gave you the strength to ge
t through all of this 
in the way that you 
did?  
 

A: For this -- to get through all 
of this was a terrible thing. Y
ou see, we had to -- everything 
worked on bribery in Germany. I 
tried to get to the States be
fore Philly was born. Didn™t 
ma ke it, so -- people say oh yeah, they can
 help, they can do, they can do. People who 
was -- who were survivors, who w-worked in 
the different embassies, and they just ma de 
money. To get money they say they can do ev
erything, didn™t. It di
dn™t work. Philly was 
born in Germany. And -- and we finally ma de
 it here. Yeah, Philip was born June 8, 
1947, in Germany. Then we came here. I came to
 New York, to my sister. I didn™t like 
the life in New York, and right away I 
-- the life, everybody™s running, rushing on the 
[indecipherable] from New York, I don™t m
ean to offend you, but everybody™s running, 
and nobody walks there. But it is -- and when 
I ask my sister why I [indecipherable] I 
look. And that™s the way it was. And I stood ther
e with my sister for a few weeks. After 
two weeks we decided to go away from ther
e. And California was the biggest choice. I 
made a friend that says I -- I met some ex-G
erma n businessman who resettled there, and 
so on, and everybody tells me , ﬁIf I would cam
e, no I wouldn™t stay here, I would go 
west.ﬂ So, Los Angeles was the choice to go to 
west. Says so, this is decided to do it. It 
was a tough time to convince my sister that I 
want to go, but I had to
 take care of my 
fa mily and myself. And at the same time, th
ere was no jobs availabl
e in New York, and I 
had to look for, but I pr ayed not to ge t it for 
me, because I didn™t want 
to stay there. I -- I 
never had to [indecipherable], never had a 
problem. So we ca me  to Los Angeles. 
 

Q: But during the period of the war, and the Holocaust -- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you think about your religion at all? 

 

A: Religion?  

 

Q: Mm-hm. Di d you thi
nk about being Jewish? 
 

A: Be?  Oh yeah. I was aware of it, sure, ab
solutely. I was aware and I was brought up this 
way, and I felt Jewish and I -- I was not re
ligious observant, but 
I knew I was Jewish. 
 

Q: Were you able to comme morate any of the 
holidays, or were you able to act out your 
religion at all? 
 

A: We tried even in the camp. We  didn™t know
 the exact dates, but we tried, we went 
through Yom Kippur, for example, fasting day. 
We fasted, [indecipherable] the right day, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
48 
 
but I fasted a day. It was not too much to be 
able to fast. But I tried to do as much as I 
can, and religion, it was not a issue that ma
ke me  a different ma n. Yeah, tough times.

Tape #7 
 
A: And we had that declaration ma de, and ev
erybody signed, my signature is there too, and 
this is buried inside. 
 

Q: Okay, wait, we -- we have to star
t from the beginning of the story now -- 
 

A: Oh,okay. 

 

Q: -- because we don™t know what you were talking about. 

 

A: The Zalost treedahoff was a big cemetery wh
ere they -- in some cases where they ma de 
their own soffages and so on, and what we 
take out to what [i ndecipherable] the 319 
dollars. But there was a big cemetery, and we
 later to establish there a permanent 
monume nt. 
 

Q: Okay, but what is not on the tape yet, is
 your story about when you went to the cemetery 
-- the mass cemetery, and exhumed t he bodies
. We don™t -- you need to tell me  about 

that. 
 

A: No, I did not personally exhume  the bodies. 
 People were br ought in goat, pulling goat, 
and we found so the bodies [indecipherable
]. I personally didn™t dig, I didn™t exhume 

anythings. 
 

Q: I understand that.  

 
A: Right. But this was all done by people organi
zed, and we transfer the Jews to the Jewish 
cemetery and so on. In zalo -- in mo ntezalo
 freedhouse is a permanent monument built, 
and all the papers are in the ground, with signa
tures and my signature is there, too. And I 
was attending all kinds of things [indecipherabl
e] lots of different occasions and so on, 
with all kinds of people who were in immi gration, who were Communist kept in Russia 
for awhile, and so on. And the all -- the a
ll ki nd of political ac -- activists, they were 
there. And -- 
 

Q: What I was asking you is that when you explai
ned to me  about the ceme tery, we were not 
recording a tape. So I needed you to tell me  wher e this was, and what happened.  
 

A: Oh where the -- 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Where the ceme tery was? Yeah. 

 

Q: When you were working in Hanover, yes? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
50 
 
A: When -- yeah, this was in Hanover. It -- it ca
lled the Zalehorst free
dof, this was the name  
for the cemetery. They have a -- they had a crematorium there and so on. The Zalehorst 
freedorf cremated lot of what they had, whatev
er bodies were sent in
 with IDs, they -- 
they cremated them, and it was our job to pul
l out later -- we  had people pull out all the 
name s of Jewish, so they could transfer to 
the Jewish cemetery. But this was part of the 

Zalehorst freedorf, and -- and when we build there the monument, all this information is 

on special paper buried in with our signature
. However -- on -- on top of this is a big 
monume nt for the survivors and so on. But we
 were attending every time  with certain 
observances of ceremoni es, and so on, so on. 
 

Q: During the war years, did you think that
 you would get throu
gh it, and that -- 
 

A: Duringthe? 

 

Q: During these war years. Do you understand -- heard me? 

 

A: No, no, you not -- I couldn™t hear
 you, that™s why I™m listening. 
 

Q: During the years of the war -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Did you think you would survive? 

 

A: No. I didn™t think of it at all. What
 happened will happen. Nobody could do anything. 
There was no -- okay, there is the [indecipherabl
e] in the camps, and so on, there was the 
will to survive the Germans, just to show th
em that we can be -- stand it, but seri ously, 
nobody could think of it. A ma tter of luck. 
 

Q: What did you think about? 

 

A: Hm?  

 

Q: What did you think about? 

 

A: What I think?  You see, I am a very differe
nt thing, I don™t give too much thought where I 
cannot help it. If I am in a situation wher
e I can do something, I will do every possibl e 

thing to get help. If I [indecipherable] wh
ere I have no influence whatsoever, I don™t 
think at  all. What will ha ppen, will happen. I wa
sn™t sure if I will survive. Happened to 
survive. And -- and happened to survive mostly because I could do some thing -- thing 

what -- what the German needed, and I could 
help on -- with the machines, with all this. 
But there was the will to survive, no questi
on about, but not -- not too much attention 

paid to it.  
 

Q: Now, 50 years later, when you think back, ar
e there certain images that stick with you? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0345  
51 
 
A: [indecipherable]again. 
 

Q: When you think back about this period of time -- 

 

A: Yes? 

 

Q: -- are there certain images that
 are very strong, stick with you? 
 

A: The images is tryi ng whatever i -- comes -- whatever comes, there were pr oblems 
[indecipherable] to try to [ind
ecipherable] as muc h as I can. I have two sons, and I have 
grandchildren, and I love to be
 -- and I love them, and they
 love us. And nothing -- but 
okay -- everybody wants to survive, there is no 
question about, but th
ere is no such thing 
what you can say I will survive, or I will not 
survive. Life is life, and what life brings, 
you are trying to do the best. I had plenty of surgeries, and all kind of treateme nts, and so 

on. I had radiation, and I -- you name it and I -- 
and I had it. But when -- I went through 
with it. And I have a lovely family, and my ch
ildren are very attached to it, and that ™s the 
way it is. I know nothing is forever, so -- but
 no way to choose at the time. At least I 
didn™t choose the time. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you wa
nt to say before we finish? 
 

A: I don™t think I have anything special, I t
hought the only thing was I 
can say, I thought to -
- to apply to the question as good as I can. I 
didn™t try to pull it a
ny personal stories to 
ma ke hi m be a hero, because I am not a hero. 
I did what I felt it is 
the right thing at any 
time. And I couldn™t be any more. I try the best
, that™s all I can do. A
nd I sure will try the 
best again.  
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Okay? 

 

Q: Thankyou. 

 

A: Thank you very, very much. It wa
s a pleasure having you interview me .
