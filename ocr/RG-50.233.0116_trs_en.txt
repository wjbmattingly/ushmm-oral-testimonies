  
Interview with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit 
August 6, 1992 
Silver Spring, MD 
 
Q: The date isAugust 6, 1992 and we™re speaking 
with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit in Silver Spring, 
Maryland.  Dr. Rozenblit is going 
to tell us about her father 
and his family, and any family 
me mbers that she can recall.  So please, could you 
tell me  your father ™s 
name, his date of birth 
and then anything you can about his childhood and his family. 
 
A: Okay, my fa ther whose na me  was Mendel Rozenblit was born on Nove mb er 13, 1907 in a town 
called Lukow in Poland. Anyway this town was 
in the area of Lublin, I don™t know exactly in 
which direction or –– Okay, so my  father was 
born in Lukow which was near Lublin in 1907.  
He was born into a pretty religious family.  I thin
k that parts of the fa mily were associated with 
the Hasidim.   But he did not grow up technically 
as a Hasidic child.  He 
was just an ordinary 
traditiona lly religious Polish Jewish boy.  His 
father died when he was very young, well not 
very young I guess. We ll let me  go backwards a litt
le bit.  My father was one of about six or 
seven children and he was in the mi ddle.  He wa
s not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of 

the mi ddle children.  His father died when he
 was a young boy. I think, if my me mory serves 
me  correctly, he was about twelve when his father
 died, which means his fa
ther died just after 
WorldWar I of asthma.  But I think he was sickly
 for most of his life.  But my grandmother, 
that is my fa ther ™s mother whose name was --we
ll I should say that my father ™s  father ™s  name  
wasAvraham Rozenblit -- and his mother Masha 
Markusfeld Rozenblit, after whom I™m named 
Marsha -- Masha, his mother ma naged quite well 
to have six children and run the family.  She 
owned a, well my mothe r  used to say she owned 
a general store, but my cousin in Israel who 
was seventeen when he left Poland and really kn
ew her, said that she 
basically owned a shoe 
store. That is, she sold othe
r things too, but it was mostly s
hoes and what she would do is, she 
would take trips toWa rsaw or Lublin and see wh
at was in the fancy shoe
 stores there and then 
copy them and arranged to have the shoes ma de. 
 She didn™t ma ke the m herself.  She wasn™t  a 
shoema ker but she would get them made and then 
sell them, both in the st
ore and also in a kind 
of–She would send her children out to sell them 
also, when they were grown, to sell them to 

the peasants in the villages. That I learned from 
my cousin in Israel.  But let me  just try to say 
some thing about my father ™s family background in ge
neral before I talk more specifically. They 
were a very religious family and pictures of my 
father show him wearing the sort of traditional 
cap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of s
quarish cap.  I can™t  te
ll from the pictures 
whether he has pais or not.  It™s  hard to tell,
 but ma ybe he did.  I shoul
d say before I go on that 
my father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor  
that we™re talking about, died in 1961 when I 
was ten years old so that most of
 my recollections come from e
ither  things I actually reme mber 
him saying, or things that my mother told me  that 
he had said, or things that my cousin in Israel, 

that is his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came 
to Palestine in 1938 has told me .  So it™s a 

sort of conglomerate of those thi
ngs.  So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in the 
Lublin area. His mother owned this shoe st
ore.  I don™t think she 
was rich but she was 
reasonably prosperous and my fath
er had all of these brothers a
nd sisters.  His oldest, I don™t 
even know the age order, I think Nehama  the sister, 
he had one sister and five brothers I believe, 
and the sister, Nehama , was I think the oldest an
d then there were other brothers. There was 
Simc ha, there was HaimYa kov, there was Meir who was the baby, there wasYe hoshua and I 

know how most of them di
ed actually and I™ll get b
ack to that later when 
we talk about it.  But 
HaimYa kov was a very ardent Zi oni
st and he left Poland before th
e war.  He went to Palestine 
in 1937 and then his son Mo
rdecai joined him in 1938. 

 
Q: We re the rest of the fami ly involved in Zionism, do you know? 

 

A: You know, I don™t know.  My cousin, Mutti, Mord
ecai, in Israel has many times told me that 
you know, he had said to me , [Marsha, at yahdat 
ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means 
Marsha, your father wasn™t  a Zionist.  But I thin
k that™s  not true.  I think that Mutti means by 
that, that my father didn™t move to Palestine af
ter the war. And Mutti is st ill ma d at him forty 
years later for not having done that. I do have his 
Zionist me mbership card from a fter the war.   
But, of course, everybody was a Zionist after th
e war.  So the question is was he an active 
Zionist before the war.  Judging fr
om the schools he sent his childre
n to I don™t think so. That is 
an active Zionist.  I don™t think he was active 
in the Zionist moveme nt, no.  But he was 
probably sympathetic to Zionism. 
 

Q: I was going to ask you about the town.  Have 
you researched or found out
 anything about that 
town, was it a shtetl or–..? 
 

A: Well, all towns are shtetls, shtetl just means little town. 

 

Q: What was the nature  of this town? 

 

A: It was a small town.  I don™t know how big it was.
  It certainly wasn™t  a large place.  Lublin was 
in central Poland so it was central Poland.  I thi
nk my i mage of it as a ch
ild was that it wa s like 
any smallAmerican town with white picket fences 
and neat little houses on 
neat little streets.  
And I was shocked in 1972 or ™03, I was talk
ing to Lucin Dovarshitsky who teaches Polish-
American history at YIBO and who is a me mber of
 whatever the staff at theYIBO Institute and 
Lucin Dovarshitsky at the time was busy collecting 
lots and lots and lots
 of pictures for the 
Image Befor e  My Eyes volume  and I said my fa
ther was from Lukow and he said well I™ve got 
a picture of Lukow, come and see 
it. So I went upstairs to his of
fice and I looked at this picture 
of Lukow and it was not my i mage.  I mean 
it was a muddy little street. This was a picture 
taken in 1926 and it was this dr
eary little muddy t own.  So it was 
a tiny little nothing of a town, 
I think. Although my cousin Mutti in Israel w
ho was seventeen when he left Lukow has nice 
me mories of it so it couldn™t have been that ho
rrendous.  I me an ma ybe this picture doesn™t do it 
justice. He has nice me mories.  My father left 
Lukow when he ma rried and lived nearWa rsaw.  
I™ll get to that in a mi nute.  So
 his adult life was not in Lukow,
 it was in aWa rsaw suburb. The 
stories of his childhood that he to
ld me  when I was little were ce
rtainly not negative.  If his 
fa mily was prosperous, even if they weren™
t rich they wouldn™t  have suffered much. 
 

Q: Do you know much about his edu
cation, where he went to school? 
 

A: He went to cheder. He was born in 1907.  He wa
s born when that part of Poland was part of the 
Russian Empire.  I know he just went to traditional cheder.  He did not have a formal secular 

education as far as I know.  I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he 

must have had some  secular education. All the 
schooling he ever spoke of was cheder.  On the 
other hand since he could read Polish novels he 
must have also gone to some thing else.  He 
didn™t have a gymnasium education, that I know.  
He didn™t go to university.  But he must have 
gone to some Polish school as well as cheder be cause you can™t read Polish easily if you hadn™t.  

Speaking it is one thing but knowing it is another.  So I think 
that he and virtually all his 
siblings just went to cheder and ma ybe also 
some  kind of Polish elementary school. There is 
one thing that is important and 
that is his younger brother, Meir, wanted very much to have a 

real secular education and he did go to Polish 
school and gymnasium in their town, or ma ybe 
not in their town, it™s hard to 
say since I was only ten when my father died, he ma y have just 
said gymnasium and ma ybe Meir went off to Lu
blin to go to gymnasium, I  don™t know.  In any 
case my grandmother who was a religious woma n, who wore a sheitel and so forth, nevertheless 
was willing to let her youngest son go to gymnasium
. This must have been already, since Meir 
is younger than my father, this must have been afterWorldWa r 1.  It must have been in the 

twenties. And the town was very ma d at he
r for doing this.  So she was some thing of a 
progressive because she was, although very 
religious, was willing to let her son go to 
gymnasium,  and of course going to gymnasiu
m meant going to school on Saturday. And 
theoretically Jews were exempt 
from writing. And in fact, they 
were.  But obviously it spoke of 
abandoning traditional Jewish life and entering the 
larger world. She was certainly willing to do 
this and was willing to de fy the town to let this
 happen.  I reme mber my father telling a story 
about how there was a library in town, like a 
secular library.  Now ma ybe  it was a Zionist 
library, ma y it was Pol–..I don™t know what and a 
lit of the ﬁfrumi esﬂ, a lot of the very 
religious people in town ma rc
hed against it and they trie
d to burn it down. And my 
grandmother, who was herself religious and not s
ecular, nevertheless sort
 of defied them and 
insisted that her son Meir go to gymnasium. Ac
tually Meir had a very different experience 
from all the rest of them.  Meir not only went
 to Polish gymnasium but after he graduated from 
gymnasium,  and this must have been into the ‚3
0™s at some  point, he went to university to study 

to be a doctor.  He didn™t go in Poland because
 it was very difficult for Jews to do that in 
Poland.  He went first in Italy 
and then in Paris.  He was pr
esumably deported from Paris to 
Auschwitz because he wa s dead too.  So his e
xperience was di fferent from everybody  else™s .  

One brother went to Palestine where he died a 
natural death in 1943 of 
a heart attack.  Haim 
Ya kov is the one who went to Pale
stine and Meir was in France. 
 

Q: Do you have pictures of either of them?  
 
A: I have pictures of Meir as a baby.  No, actually 
as an adult, too.  Come  to think of it, yes, there 
is a picture of Meir as an adult,
 two pictures of Meir as adults
.  One from Italy and one I™m not 
sure where fr om.  He we nt to Pisa and studied me
dicine and then he was 
in Paris.  I think he 
married in Paris but I don™t thi
nk he had children. And I don™t know what happened to his wife.  
I don™t know if she was deported or not deported.  
My father never tried to look her up after the 
war. And my mother, after my father ™s  death, wa
s suspicious that perhaps Meir ™s wife wasn™t  
Jewish and that™s  why my father hadn™t  bothered 
to look her up after the wa r because he was in 
Munich for two and a half years after the war, 
he could have. And he knew his brother was in 
Paris. And he found out that his brother had 
been deported so he could have presumably 
investigated his brother ™s wife but
 he didn™t.That ma y mean that
 the family was angry that he 
had ma rried a non-Jewish woma n or some thing li
ke that. Anyway Meir ™s  experience as an 
educated Jew, as an educated person and the f
act that HaimYa kov was a devout Zionist, I think 
indicates that  this family, while very religious
, clearly had its arms out to the modern world, 

either through Jewish nationalism or through secu
lar education. And it™s also true that my 
father, although raised as a very religious little bo
y, as an adult was not re
ligious. As an adult in 
Poland, I don™t mean inAmerica after the war, that
™s some thing else.  But as an adult in Poland 
was not as religious as he had been growing up. 
 He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to 
Jewish schools, he was very Je
wish, but that was norma l in Pola
nd.  People did that.  But he 
was not that observant a 
Jew as an adult in the thirties as
 he had been growing up although his 
mother rema ined religious. And I assume  some  ofhis siblings were and so
me weren™t.  I really 
don™t know. That would be a nice question to ask.
  My cousin in Israel would know all these 
answers because he was seventeen when he left 
and he would have a better sense of who was 

religious and who was not. Anyway what else 
can I say about just his family background.  His 
mother had this store. I think se
veral of his brothers were involv
ed in running the store or in, as 
I said, selling to the peasants.  But some of th
e brothers moved.  He himse l f moved toWa rsaw.  
I think another brother, Si mcha move d toWarsaw
.  I™m not sure where his sister Nehama  lived 
when she grew up.  I me an they were all adults 
by the ‚30™s and they were all ma rried and had 
children and so forth. The only thing I could sa
y I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld 
Rozenblit, I mean ‚Markusfeldﬂ is very impor
tant.  She was a Markusfe ld.  Rozenblit wa s 
some thing that accrued to her but she was a Markus
feld.  She must have been a very feisty lady, 
she sounds like it. She ran this store, she had he
r six kids `which she ra
ised by herself, or at 
least partly. We  have a picture of her.  She 
looks like a Jewish woma n from Poland but she was 
kind of a neat lady, I think. 
 
Q: Do you know when she was born?   

 

A: No, but she was in her sixties when she was kill
ed.  So that would ma ke her born in the 1880™s.  
Right and if my father was born in 1907 that™s  about
 right.  So she would have been born in the 
1880™s or 1870™s, probably in the 1870™s if he wa
s born in 1907 and he was not her first child, 
he was her third or fourth child. And I think my fa ther ™s fa ther,Avraham Rozenblit, he  was 

probably in his forties when he 
died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the 
1870™s.  My father, by the way, even though he di
d not have formal higher education or even 
secondary education, knew a lot of languages like 
ma ny Jews  of that part of the world. Yi ddish 
was of course his native language like it was for 
virtually all the Jews 
of Poland except a small 
group of hyper- assimilated Jews.  But he was fl
uent in Polish and that wa s common for his 

generation, that is people who ca me  of age in 
the twenties and thirties 
knew increasingly also, 
unless they were just Hasidim, 
increasingly really knew Polish. And certainly my cousin Mutti, 
the one who moved to Palestine in 1937, ™38, Mutti 
went  to Polish public school in the thirties 
and has very fond me mo ries of hi
s teachers in the Polish elementa
ry school in Lukow, that they 

were not anti-Semitic.  I don™t know if he™s telling 
the whole truth when he says that, it ma y be 
nostalgia.  I mean he has unkind words about Poles 
in general but his teachers were very loving 
and very nice and he has very fond me mories 
of going to elementary school in Polish although 
how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard
 to say, because at 
this point in the 1990™s 
after living in Israel for fifty odd years he 
really can speak only Hebrew andYi ddish and 
English which he learned in the British army 
duringWorldWar II but his Polish, I think, is so 
rusty that he didn™t use it.  Bu
t anyway my father knewYi ddish of course which was his mother 
tongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently. 
 He knew He brew.  Now that™s  unusual. That 
would indicate also a Zionist whatever.  I don™t 
know.  My mother says he knew Hebrew.  Now 
what does that mean.  She says, sh
e insisted that he spoke mo dern
 Israeli Hebrew, that he could 
easily speak Hebrew to an Israeli.  I don™t 
reme mber that although we did have an Israeli 
neighbor in the fifties and my mother says he sp
oke to her in Hebrew.  Now ma ybe he said three 
words and my mother thought that meant he
–– Certainl y he had a traditiona l cheder 
education  and he was well versed.  He wasn™t
 aTa lmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a 
traditiona lly educated Jew knew Hebrew.  It wasn™t  
rote.  He could look at the prayer book or at 
a bible and understand what it sai
d.  He knew Russian.  I don™t know if he could read or write 
Russian but he certainly could sp eak Russian and he knew German. 
 So he knew his languages.  
Okay what else can I say about 
just childhood.  My father was clea
rly a very mi schievous little 
boy because there are several stor
ies that I reme mber of him di
rectly telling me for example 
about how they tormented the Malame d at ched
er, how they tormented the teacher at the 
traditional Jewish school in the cheder.  In fact
 I reme mber when I was in Hebrew school as a 

child he would say to me , Marsha you must never 
do the things to your teach
er that we did, that 

I did to our teachers. And he did all the things 
you read about in all the Ha skala, I me an putting 
tacks on the chair and putting honey
 on the chair and they just 
bedeviled the life of the poor 
teacher, which was standa rd, standa rd childhood high-
jinx. And the other thi
ng is that his sister 
Neha ma  who was older than he, probably three 
or four years older even though she was three 
children older, his sister Neha ma  wanted a 
date. WorldWa r I was a kind of liberating 
experience, not the war itself, th
at was just a horrible experience.
  In the aftermath of the war 
things really opened up and soci
al life really changed. And sh
e wanted to go out on dates but 
her mother didn™t want her to because her mother 
was still very traditional. And so my father 
and another one of his brothers w
ould conspire with her to sneak 
her out of the house. And they 
did this through some  ki nd of closet, some  ar mo
i r e, in Europe they have these closets and 
apparently they would move it against the wi
ndow and open the window and open the back of 
the closet. I don™t reme mber the exact details but 
I have vivid me mories of riding in our fa mily 
car in the 1950™s with my father 
telling me  stories about how they 
would trick his mother so that 
Neha ma  could go out on a date with probably 
the ma n she ended up ma rrying.  But, you know, 
nothing serious.  She didn™t cover her hair, actually.  
Pictures we have of her 
or that I™ve seen of 
her as an adult, she didn™t  cover her hair.  So
 clearly this was a very mi schievous child.  He 
always had a twinkle in his eyes 
as an adult, too, so he clearl
y was the kind–..and survivors, of 
course, were often the kind of people who were 
mi schievous sorts.  Okay, I think I don™t know 
very much more about my father
™s  real childhood, that is when 
he was a baby.  If I think of 
anything I™ll come  back to it.  My father got ma
rried pretty young.  He got
 ma rried when he was 
about twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his 
whom he loved very deeply.  So this was also 
non-traditional in a way, that is it was 
a love marriage, not 
an arranged one. 
 

Q: Was it a fi rst cousin? 

 

A: You know I think it was a first cousin.  I think 
it was his first cousin.  
I™m not a hundred per cent 
positive that she was his fi rst cousin but she wa
s defi nitely his cousin.  Her father owned a 

lumber yard in theWa rsaw area in a town
 calledWolomi n, which I think is spelled 
W_O_L_O_M_I_N, I™m not a hundred per cent sure but 
I think so.  It™s in theWa rsaw area.  So 
he moved toWarsaw, or toWolomi n, and he ran 
his father-in-law™s business or worked with his 

father-in-law in running the business.  His wife
 though, whose name  was either Mira or Perella 

I don™t reme mber which, his wife though died ab
out a week after their first child was born 
because she had a rheuma tic heart and she was warned by doctors not to have any children and 

she then di dn™t  listen.  She wanted a child, it wasn
™t  accidental. They weren™t that religious and 
she died very shortly after he was born. 
 

Q: So you think she was probab
ly about twenty years old? 
 

A: She was probably twenty, twenty-one.  I think 
my fa ther was twenty-
one and she was probably 
the same  age or a year younger.  She was very young. Their son™s name  wasAvraham.   He was 

name d after my father ™s father. Avraham was 
born therefore, let™s see in 1943 when he was 
killed, he was twelve.  So he was born in 1931. 
 So my father wasn™t  twenty-one, he wa s 

twenty-four. We ll, whatever. These stories ha
ve gotten passed from my
 mother who was not 
especially good at dates but I thinkAvraham 
was born either in 1930 or 1931. And his wife 
died and he was very, very mi serable, naturally
. And the fa mily talked him into ma rrying her 
sister whose name  was either Mira or Perella.  In
 other words, Mira and Pe
rella were his wives.  
I just don™t reme mber which was the first and 
which was the second.  I 
think Perella was the 
second.  I think Mira was the first. Again I™mreally not a hundred pe
rcent sure. Again my 
cousin in Israel would know the an
swer. And they had another child. 

 
Q: The fa mily talked him into it. Wa s 
this under duress then 
that he did this? 
 

A: No, I think they talked him into
 it in the sense that this is the 
smartest and best thing to do. The 
child needs a mother, what better mother than he
r sister.  She needs a husband, she™s a nice lady, 
why don™t you just ma rry her. You know I think 
it was that kind of thing. And he was very 
depressed and he needed a mother for his child
 and ma ybe s he was already taking care of the 
kid.  I don™t know exactly but he definitely ma rried
 her. And it was all right.  Obviously it was 
sad.  I didn™t know this when I was a child. Wh
en I was a child my father was very open and 
talked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience 
and about his life before the war.  But for 
whatever reason, ma ybe  because it was ordinary tr
agedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy 
of the Holocaust, he didn™t  tell me  about the fact
 that his first wife ha
d died.  He thought that 
would be too sad for me .  Here he was telli
ng me  about his son and daughter who had been 
slaughtered by the Nazis. And that he could te
ll me  about.  But the specifi c tragedy of his own 
personal life with his wife™s 
death he didn™t tell me .  I found out when I was twenty or 
some thing. A cousin of his inAmerica was visi
ting us and she just me
ntioned it casually.  I 
said, what are you talking about?   
And she told me  the whole stor
y and I just bawled.  It was 
very sad that this love of his life died in childbi
rth.  But anyway he did have a daughter with the 
second wife.  Her name  wasToby. That™s  what
 my mother called her.  It™s  probablyTova, 

which again sounds both modern and 
Hebraic, Gittel is theYi ddis
h. Tova is already a sign of 
modernity in its modern Jewish form.  She wa
s four years younger thanAvraham.  So she 
would have been born in 1934 or ™35, some thi
ng like that, or ™33 depending on exactly when 

Avraham was born.And my father continued to li
ve inWolomi n with his wife and running this 
lumberyard.  He sent his kids to -- there we
re several Jewish school systems in Poland as you 
know. There was the Zionist school system and 
the Bundist school system and the ﬁfrumi eﬂ, 
the religious school system and so forth.  He sent
 his children to a school system that was very 
likeAmerican Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish
 subjects which were taught in Hebrew and 
secular subjects were taught in Polish which was 
not the case in the Zionist or Bundist schools 
where everything was taught eith
er in Hebrew orYi ddish with only a mi nima l a mount of 
Polish.  So his children went to 
this kind of modern Jewish school
 which means, of course, that 
it was a little bit more religious
 than both the Zionist or th
e Bundist schools which would 
indicate a kind of moder a te religi
ous position.  So that™s the kind of
 school he sent his kids to.  
As I said he kept a kosher home. I don™t think 
he was Sabbath observing. 
 So he was kind of a 
little traditional, but not–. 
 

Q: And they spokeYi ddish at home, I assume . 

 

 

A: You know I don™t know what language.  Certainl
y growing up he spokeYi ddish at home , that 
goes without saying. What language did he speak as
 an adult in his family inWolomi n?   I don™t 
know.  I really don™t know if he spokeYi ddish or
 Polish or both. You 
know if you™re utterly 
fluent it probably depends on your mood. Yi ddish
 was definitely his mother tongue, what he 
dreamed in, what he counted in was definite
lyYiddish, but I don™t know.  I bet they spoke 
Yi ddish.  I think most Jews spokeYiddish. 
 

Q: That would be my guess . 

 

Q: My guess would beYi ddish although ma ybe some
ti me s Polish depending if the kids came  back 
from school and spoke Polish, then you answered th
em in Polish and then all of a sudden for an 

hour you were talking Polish.  But then if you 
stopped talking for a mi nute and then started 
talking again you probably would speakYi ddish becau
seYiddish was the natural thing to speak.  
After the war inAmerica my fa ther was utterly 
fluent in English.  He learned English very 
quickly and spoke English with my mother whowasAmerican born.  But with his friends from 
Lukow who had survived the war, and some  of 
them had as partisans and so on, these friends 
who were inAmerica, their na
tural language that they spoke 
wasYi ddish although all of them 
were modern.  None of them were orthodox and 
so forth. The natural language they would 
speak wasYi ddish.  But some ti me s they would ju
st speak Polish and it would drive my mother 
crazy because as anAmerican Jew she did know
Yi ddish but she didn™t 
know Polish. And she 
would get very angry with them whe n they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they 

would speak Polish to ma ke her angrier because th
ey were very jealous of her because she had 
parents because she wasAmerican 
and they didn™t . The thing th
ey had on her was that they 
could speak more languages and so they would 
speak Polish.  But my guess is thatYiddish 
would be the language of his home .  I don™t kno
w what kind of home  he lived in.  He was 
certainly reasonably prosperous, ce
rtainly mi ddle class and definitely
 in contact with his fa mily 
in Lukow.  He still had brothers and I think his sist
er was there.  His mother certainly was there.  

Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins an
d nieces and nephews. All of his brothers and 
sisters had ma rried. They all had children.  He wa
s the closest with his sister. The sibling he 
talked the very most about was his sister. Th
ey were name d for the same  person.  Mendel is a 
Yi ddish nickname  for Menachem and so technica
lly his name was Menachem MendelTzidik.  I 
should tell you my father ™s formal name  was 
Menachem MendelTzidik Rosenblit which would 
translate --Tzidik isTzadok.  Just a Jewish 
way of sayingTzadok and Nehama , his sister, who 
was called Nechuma, ??  raised 
eyes that she was called Nech
uma.  Nechuma was obviously 
name d for the same  person.  She was born first and they named her Nehama  to be aft e r 

whatever relative, Menachem.  So when my fa
ther was born they named him after the same 
relative.  So he was very close with his sist
er and he talked about 
Meir because Meir was 
unusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to s t udy 

medicine. That was all he talked about with 
any specificity except in 
terms of how e ach of 
them died in the Holocaust and I can tell you abou
t that when we talk about the war years.  I 
don™t know what his wife did.  I don™t  know if hi
s wife worked or not.  Pr obably not given the 
1930™s in Poland and mi ddle class family.  I doubt that she worked. They were definitely 

mi ddle class. This is not some body ma king -- w
ith nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because 
well ma ybe this isn™t a good historical -- forget th
is.  I was going to say I™ve seen the list of 
property that he presented to the United Restitutio
n Organization as part of his reparation claim.  
It™s the kind of things mi ddle class people have, 
you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so 

forth.  But you know people could lie on those so 
that™s not necessary a good source.  I think 
that despite the very terrible situation for 
Jews in Poland in the 1930™s, you know very high 
anti-Semitism and very terribl e ec onomy and so forth.That my fa ther did reasonabl y well.  He 

certainly didn™t  give any thought as fa r as I 
know to mi grating, although, 
there was no place to 
mi grate to except for Palestine. And he wasn™t
 enough of a Zionist to want to go to Palestine 
although his brother HaimYa kov did. They had re
latives inAmerica like probably every Jew in 
Poland butAmerica was out of the question by the 
twenties so I think he was perfectly content 
to be in Poland.  In terms of his attitude toPoland as a country, actually when he was born, he 

was born in Russia, and of course the Polish Jews
 hated Russia because they were disc rimi nated 
against so severely, I th
ink he thought of hi ms elf as a Polish 
national.  I think 
he was a typical 
Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.  If you asked him, who are 

you, what are you, he would say I am a Jew.  But he was Polish, he spoke
 Polish, he identified 
with the Polish state.  He thought of hims elf as a 
Polish subject.  He used that word actually.  
He called hims elf a Polish subject which is a 
funny archaic word which is usually used for 

kingdoms.  But that™s  how Jews were in Poland.Th
ey were me mbers of the Polish state but they 
weren™t Poles so he would never have said that 
he was a Pole because he wa sn™t  a Pole, he was 
a Jew.  I suppose he was hoping that the Polish 
Republic would get to be a nicer pl ace than it 
was. As I said I was ten when he died and at 
ten I didn™t ask him such 
nice interesting political  
questions as what you thought a
bout Poland and how you related to Poland and so on. What 
else could I tell you about right before the war? 
 
Q: This is good. This is all good and it™s  what we need. 

 

A: That™s  what you need.  So basically befo
re the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on 
September 1, 1939, my father had a business that 
was reasonably prosperous.  He lived in a 
town nearWa rsaw calledWolomi n.  He had a wi
fe; he had two children, a boy and a girl.  He 
had a huge extended family.  He had a very la
rge fa mily, he had a mother and sisters and 
brothers, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles,
 cousins.  He had a 
large and intact and 
functioning fa mily. And then the war started. 
 

Q: So what happened? 

 

A: What happened, okay. You know I™m used to te
lling the st ory to my six -year old son and of 
course to my six- year old son I have to include
 what happened during the wa
r.  I have to sketch 
out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews 
and I don™t have to do that here.  In the first 
months of the war there was just chaos and all ki
nds of restrictions against the Jews.  I assume  
that his business wasAryanized b
ecause that™s  what the Germans did as soon as they came in.  
TheyAryanized businesses giving them to ethni
c Germans.  I assume my father was not 

compensated for it.  He was a clever ma n.  He 
probably ma naged to get stuff out of it before it 
was technicallyAryanized.  In all the stories he 
talked about the years before he was deported to 
Auschwitz he never me ntioned that he was starvi
ng to death and he was 
living on the street or 
anything like that.  Of course 
he was starving but he wasn™t––He mus t  have ma naged to get 
some thing out of his business even though he wasn™t
 compensated for it.You read about this in 
the me moirs people who with Polish friends mana
ge to ma ke arrangements and deals and so 
forth.  But anyway his business was confiscated, 
his bank accounts frozen, all of those things 
taken from him.  But then, of course, he was in
 the ghetto.  Now when my father was alive and 
he talked about his experiences in
 the war he alwa ys simply said
 the ghetto.  He didn™t specify 
which one. When my mother, who is not a histor
ian and who is not at all good with details and 
in fact was terribl e with details, when my mother
 talked about it for hi m, 
after he died, or when 
I would ask her as I got 
a little older, well which ghetto, she sa
id theWa rsaw ghetto, that he was 
in theWa rsaw ghetto.  Some  of the details of 
his story very much ma tch theWa rsaw ghetto in 

terms of–..well the fact is he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning inApril 1943.  

That™s  theWa rsaw ghetto. What other ghett
o was burning inApril ™43 that you could escape 
from in some way. But on the other hand, he didn
™t  live inWa rsaw.  He lived inWolomi n which 
was close toWarsaw. There coul d have been a gh
etto inWolomi n.  On the other hand it was so 
close toWa rsaw that all the people ma y have be
en moved toWa rsaw.  But usually people who 
had to move  into a pl ace did very, very badly. And my father obviously didn™t fare badl y.  I 

think that he probably wa s in theWa rsaw ghetto. 
 He probably did just simply get mo ved from 

Wolomi n intoWa rsaw.  Let™s say for the purposes of this record that he was in theWa rsaw 

ghetto. 
 

Q: Have you looked up any of the records aboutWo lomi
n if they did transfer them at some  point?   

 

A: No, I have never done that.  
It™s funny, I™m a historian a
nd not a genealogist and so I™m 
interested in what happened to 
the Jews and I™ve never bothered to
 look up the specifics of my 
father ™s experience in any systematic way. A lo
t of his experiences that
 he described are very, 
very similar to what you read in the me moirs. 
 So it fits in very we
ll.  But I never tried 
to–..when I was reading ItzhakArrad™s book abou
t ???? Tr eblinka which is about the operation 
??? death camps which basically gassed all the Je
ws of Poland and certainly the region he was 
living in because the section of Poland that bo
th he and his family was in was the general 
governme nt. The Ger mans came in and annexe
d the Bartoland and 
created the general 
governme nt and the Soviets took the eastern part 
of Poland.  So my father was in the general 
governme nt. Anyway when I read that I did pay 
attention to see if there was any word about 
Wolomi n. There was description of deporta
tions fr omWolomi n but I don™t know. There 
probably are no records of theWolomi n ghetto.  In 
any case, for the sake of argume nt I say that 
my father was in theWa rsaw ghetto.  I think he
 ma y have worked for the Jewish Council.  He 
never said that. This is not a me mory I have fr
om him or from my moth
er or from my cousin 
Mutti who wouldn™t have known because my cous
in Mutti could only give me  infor mation 
about the pre-war period because he left in 1938.  
I have a memory from when I was a child of a 
friend of my  father ™s  fromWolomi n, a ma n who 
had been a worker of his in his lumberyard 
who he was inAuschwitz with and who had also 
survived and who remained a friend after the 
war.  He™s still alive, a man name d Shaya May.  I 
think he™s still alive.  He was alive five years 
ago when my mother died because I called him 
but I assume he™s still alive.  Shaya once I 
reme mber when I was a child, it was right after my
 father died, too, actually he was talking to 
my mother about my father duri
ng the war.  He me ntioned some
thing about my father working 
for that traitorous Council or some thing like th
at. A lot of Jews hated the Council. He was 
certainly not a me mber of the Council, of th
e 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly 
would have come  across his name  if he were
. TheWa rsaw ghetto Judenhad had several 
hundred employees so he ma y have known some
one who knew some body 
who got him a job on 
the Council.  So he ma y have worked on the Counc
il.  From my me mori es 
of all the stories of 
the ghetto years I don™t have any sense that he was 
in terrible shape.  Obviously all the Jews had 
very little food and fuel and so forth. Things we
re very difficult in the ghettoes.  But his family 
was intact.  He had a son and his daughter. His 
son and daughter attended school.  I think his 
wife taught school in the ghetto. 
 My mother said that. Either
 she taught school or she taught 
piano.  I think both stories, I reme mb er.  So she 
was involved in this kind of moral resistance 
that took place, the organization 
of clandestine schools, and sort 
of doing moral and cultural and 
so forth things.  I don™t think I know very much
 more about the specific ghetto experience. 
 
Q: So you don™t know if they lived with other families or–.? 

 

A: That I just don™t know. The only person 
who mi ght know is Shaya May but Shaya never 
wanted to talk about his experien
ces very much whereas my father 
talked about it all the time.  I 
should add I have another source about my father ™s 
experiences and that is that when he went to 
school inAmerica, when he came toAmerica,
 the equivalent of ﬁ What I did on my summer 
vacation,ﬂ he  had to write an essay about his 
expe riences. He had to write an essay that 

described his experiences during thewar, I guess, so he wrote, I have
 part of that essay, part of 
it is mi ssing.  But he just says I suffered te
rribly and goes on.  He doesn™t  provide specific 
details about what it was like in the ghetto or  
in the camps. There was also, of course, the 

testimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen 
for the reparation claim which my mother typed 
and of which there is no copy although she sw
ears she ma de one.  She doesn™t  know what 
happened to it and she suspects th
at my father actually destro
yed the copy. I don™
t know why.  
But the copy just doesn™t exist.  Most of he
r me mories I suppose come  fr om that formal 

document that she typed for him. So I don™t know if
 he lived with others or what the situation 
was.  Probably he did, most Jews
 did, it was a very crowded situa
tion.  Most of his fa mily, of 
course, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto altho
ugh he had a brother inWa rsaw.  Simc ha was 
inWa rsaw and Simc ha was shot for playing card
s after curfew. He was 
shot during the time of 
the ghetto. I mean for not playing cards but af
ter playing cards going out
 in the street. So 
Simc ha died before the de portations. And he 
had been inWa r saw because he had moved to 
Wa rsaw already in the thirties or twenties or
 something and I don™t know why he had moved or 
what he did at all. Again my cousin Mutti 
woul d probably know although he ma y not because 
since he was in Lukow he didn™t really know th
e war–..he actually knew my father the least 
well because my father was already inWarsaw.  He reme mb ers my father comi ng home to visit 

twice or three times and giving him a ball or some
thing like that.  His stor
ies are really best.  
From my cousin Mutti in Israel I mostly 
learned about my grandmother, about Masha 
Rozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too.
 Anyway so I really don™t know mu ch about 
the ghetto years except that things
 were okay.  His brother was s
hot but things were reasonably 
okay.  Of course then came  the deportations. 
 During the deportations from the Lukow ghetto, 
his mother was shot.  She was in her sixties and ra
ther than take her to 
Tr eblinka or Sobibor or 
wherever they were taking the Jews from L
ukow, they shot her.  Some body must have 
witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn™t  in Lukow.  She was shot. I 

assume  the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunt
s, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were 

probably just deported to wherever Jews 
from Lukow were deported to and gassed. 
 

Q: Do you know what year this was, wa s it ™43? 

 

A: No, well of all Polish Jewry, it™s ™42.  
The operation Rhinehart which just  simply went 
me thodically and liquidated all the ghettoes be
gan some thing like March of ™42 and was over 
by October ™42 with some pockets left. That is th
ere were Jews left in theWa rsaw ghetto and in 
the–.was it the Lublin? Yeah 
the Lublin ghetto was ma de into  a labor camp and a couple of 
other pl aces. There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue . Those were 

destroyed in ™43.  I assume  that 
probably all of those relatives we
re killed in ™42 unless by some  
chance Shia or another one of his brothers was 
in the labor camp, in 
the Jeneska Road labor 
camp or PoniyetTovah, I forgot there were a whole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area 

which ma ybe his brot her or one of his nephews b
ecause if my  father ™s son was already twelve 
by that time then his older brother ™s kids could 
have been teenagers.  So maybe they we re 

in–..But I just don™t know.  I assume that everybody was just killed in ™42.  His sister Nehama , 

though, who lived in Lukow with her fa mily
, you know I wrote down that her name  was 
Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein. Ye
s, her name  was Bernstein.  Pearlma n was my 
father ™s  wife™s  ma iden name .  She and her husband
 who was much shorter than her, that was the 
joke of the family, that Neha ma  who was very ta
ll, I presumably look like Nehama , - -  that when 
I was a kid we would go to the LukowYoung Me
n™s BenevolentAssociat
ion and all the people 
who had come from my father ™s town -- and pe
ople would go Neha ma , Neha ma . They looked 
at me .  I don™t look like her in the pictures bu
t they thought I looked like
 her. But anyway she 
and her fami ly, her husband and her children (she 
probably had teen-age children)  hid in the 
woods. The y some how escaped th
e ghetto.  I don™t know if they 
escaped in ™42 or if they 
escaped earlier but they were hi
ding in the woods near there in
 the Lublin region. And they 
were only killed in ™44, about three months before
 the end of the war in that part of Poland.  
They were handed over by some  Pol e s to the N
azis at that point.  So I don™t know what 
happened to them if they were then sent toAu
schwitz or if they were
 shot right away or 
whatever.  But they di d succeed in hiding.  Nechuma, I should be fair, her name  was not 

Neha ma , her name  was Nechuma. Actually she 
used a Polish name  too, Helenie, she used the 

name  Helenie. There are pictur es on the back 
that say Helenie.  I think she was the only one 
that used a Polish name .  My father didn™t.  He used Mendel, hisYi ddish name  and all the 
others, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew na
mes.  But she used both Nechuma and Helenie.  
But anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had b
een hiding for years, at
 least for two, ma ybe 
even more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some  Poles for (as my mother used to 

say, for a bottle of vodka).The Poles were
 given booty for handing over Jews. Now I don™t 
know if these people had just happened upon them a
nd turned them over or if these we re people 

who had been helping them all along and then 
turned them over, because often people were 
hiding with the assistance of Poles.  Maybe
 it was neighbors, good Po
les who were helping 
them who turned them over, who knows.  I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of 

the family, his mothers and brothers and sisters,
 well whatever, there™s no
t that many brothers 
by that time because Simcha and his family were inWarsaw and presumably they were 

deported in 1942.  Simc ha had been 
shot earlier for curfew violati
ons but presumably his family 
was deported in ™42 when most of the Jews in
Wa rsaw were deported.  In Lukow Haim, his 
brother HaimYa kov had already gone to Palest
ine although his family hadn™t. My father ™s 

brother HaimYa kov had gone to Palestine in 19
37 alone.  His son Mutti, followed him in 1938 
leaving the wife and the other child
ren.  So they were all presumably
 killed also in ™42.  Shia 
was there and his family presumably were al
l killed and Nehama  was there but she was in 

hiding until ™44 when she was handed over to the N
azis, she and her family were handed over to 
the Nazis and killed and of c
ourse Meir was in Pa ris and he was deported, I assume , again I 
don™t know this, but I assume  he was deported in 
July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took 
place, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Je
ws in Paris were deported.  Now this is not 

necessarily true.  He could have escaped to th
e south and have been pi
cked up at some  other 
time.  He definitely was deported toAuschwitz b
ecause after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel, 
he was too upset to deal with 
the issue but his wife  Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red 
Cross and the United Nations Relief and RehabilitationAgency to track down all the Rozenblit 
relatives, also her own relatives from her own fa
mily. But her family was mostly in Palestine 
because they were all Zionist w
ho™d come  mostly in the 20™s.   So she tracked them down and 
she found my father and she found nobody else.  So 
in fact the first time I saw those letters I 
wanted to cry because the first letter had to 
be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in 
English. So the fi rst letter to my father that  my
 c ousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English 
so I could read it easily and my father didn™t 
know English yet but Mutti 
knew English and then 
of course all subsequent correspondence was just
 real letters because my father had a real 
address and that was all inYi ddish which I could 
read too but with much more difficulty so I 
didn™t read it quite as easily.  But she f
ound nobody else.  So I assume  obviously she would 
have found -- there were all these organizations 
after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish 
organizations tracking down people.  So he was pr
esumably killed either in ™42 or ™43 or ™44, 
everybody else.And Nehama  definitely in ™44. 
 Simc ha at some  point before ™42, everybody 
else in ™42 except for my  father and his family. 
 In any case assumi ng that my father was in the 
Wa rsaw ghetto, his family was able to stay there 
after that  initial depletion of theWarsaw ghetto 
inAugust/September of 1942. That confirms that
 he worked for the Jewish Council actually 
because the people who stayed inWarsaw, the 
70,000 or so that rema ined after the ma jor 
liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or
 were involved in SS industry, or whatever 
industry that was working for the German economy.  
 
Q: Maybe that lent itself also to them having s
lightly better food conditions
 or some thing like that. 
 

A: That™s right. Also I think theWolomi n ghetto 
was simply, I read that in Orad theWolomi n was 
totally dest royed in 1942.  So my fa ther I know 
was in the ghetto untilApril of 1943. That™s 

Wa rsaw, thatApril ™43 date is so fundame ntallyWa
rsaw that he had to have been in theWa rsaw 
ghetto.  In fact he always lit a 
yahrtzeit candl e for his children 
at Pesach because that™s around, I 
mean theWa rsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on 
the second night of Pesach. And they didn™t 
die that  night.  I™ll tell that st
ory in a mi nute but it was just a 
fe w weeks later.  So Pesach of 
1943, so Pesach is when he lit a yahrtzeit 
candle for everybody then.  I don™t know, maybe 
because he was inWa rsaw and that had such 
an impact on his conscience.  His mother was 
probably shot at some  point in 1942 not necessarily
 at Pesach.  My father, therefore, and his 
wife and his children and his wi
fe™s  sister who was crippled, 
not totally crippled but she 
schlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were to
gether in the ghetto.  So he was in the ghetto 
after that liquidation inAugust/September 1942 
when most of the peopl
e in the ghetto were 
liquida ted.  So he was one of the 70,000  that st ayed in the ghetto untilApril of ™43 when the 

Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the ghe
tto.  Now my  father in 1943, he was born in 
1907, so in 1943 he was 36. We ll he wasn™t  yet becau
se hi s birthday is Nove mber, so he was 35 
years old.And he had a twelve-year old son a
nd an eight-year old daughter and a wife  and a 
sister-in-law. And they decided to escape from
 the burning ghetto.  Because of the uprising the 
Nazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in 
firebombs and so forth and basically burned the 

ghetto down. And my father and his fa mily deci
ded to escape from the ghetto.  I don™t know if 
that means they went through the sewers or not. InWa rsaw that™s how people escaped from the 

ghetto. This is where he really 
told. My father told the st ories fr om the escape fr om theWarsaw 
ghetto until liberation. That™s what he  told. Th
e ghetto experience di dn™t interest hi m.  That 
must mean that it was not too terrible.  My imag
e of hearing the story as a child was that they 
escaped into the woods.  But 
there are no woods around theWa rs
aw ghetto or aroundWa rsaw 
even for that ma tter. So I don™t know how they
 escaped, presumably they did it through the 
sewers.  But in any case they escaped.  Oh, I do 
know, my mother I think told me  this that he 
did ma ke attempts through Polish, non-Jewish fri
ends to get his childr
en to be taken by non-
Jews. And nobody would do it.  He was unable to 
get anybody to agree to do that.  So anyway 
there he was with his twelve year old, his eight 
year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they 
escaped and somehow they made it to some woods,
 or ma ybe not to some  woods, they were just 

out. They had a kind of pact that if one of th
em s hould get lost, they would not look for that 
person because that could be problematic and instead
 if one of them should
 get lost, they should 
go to a farm house that they knew which was some
 distance away, my me mory is 90 kilome ters 
but I was a little kid when I heard this so 
I don™t know where it was.  Some howAvra ham, my 

father ™s  son, who by the way was not calledAvra
ham, that™s my way of Hebraisizing it again, 
it™s Avremy, the Yi ddish nickname  for Abraham. 
Avre my who was twelve some how got lost, he 
wasn™t  there.  My father ™s  wife said that she 
had to go look forAvremy and my father said no.  
We ™ll lose you if you do that. We  ha ve to stic
k together and go to the farmhouse. We ™ll find 
Avre my at the farmhous e. And she just was ma d 
with concern for her son who™s not technically 
her son but she had raised him his whole life so 
he was her son. And she went to look for him 
and they never saw her again.  I assume  that 
means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the 
SS and taken directly toAuschwitz which at 
that point was the onl
y, by 1943 -- oh ma ybe not 
Auschwitz, ma ybe she was taken toTr eblinka, I 
don™t know where she was taken to but she was 
presumably killed.  But my father and his daught
er and his sister-in-la
w did go to this far m 
house and they foundAv remy there without his s
hoes, a Polish far mer had taken them, probably 
he needed them, probably he thought thatAvremy
 would be killed soon anyway, what did he 
need shoes for. Who knows why he took them, but
 he took them.  This 
isApril of ™43, my 
father,Avremy,Toby andTova whatever, and 
his sister-in-law whose name  I don™t know and 

then they were arrested, they were found.  I mean
 it was very hard to really escape especially 
since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were
 so eager to find them.  
And he was taken to 
Auschwitz. They were taken toAuschwitz.  Of c
ourse my father was 35, and the rest of them 

were not 35, they were twelve, eight, a
nd I don™t know how old his sister-in-law was, 
presumably in her thirties too but she was crippl
ed. And she was as if the mother of these 
children. She was an adult female with two child
ren. And so when they got toAuschwitz, he 
was sent to the left or the right
, whichever way.  He was sent 
to do slave labor and they were 
sent the other way which means that they were
 gassed.  So inApril of 1943 his son and his 
daughter and sister-in-la
w were killed by the Nazis.  But he was inAuschwitz and he was a 
slave laborer inAuschwitz for a long time.  He 
worked inAuschwitz and he would talk about 
his experiences quite a lot. He talked about how
 awful it was although I must say that he did not 
dwell on how awful it was.  My fa
ther talked about his experience in the camps a lot. Saturday 

nights when we would have company,  in the 
1950™s  if you were a Jewish family in Brooklyn 
you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we 
would have bagels and lox and herring and so 
on and company and he would talk . People woul
d say Mark what was it 
like. And he would 
talk. And I just reme mb er Saturday nights in 
my childhood hearing my fa ther talk about this.  
And when he talked about it he did not talk a
bout the horrors so much.  He certainly ma de it 
very clear that it was so horri
fic that you could not even imagin
e it. And in fact when people 
would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but
 you know howAmericans could be presumptuous 
and they would say, how could you have done such a thing?  Like my father would say we 

found a rat and we ate it or some thing. And they
™d say, ooh how could you eat a rat?   It™s  not 
really nasty. And he would say, you shouldn™t tal
k, you don™t know what it™s like to be in a fire.  
I reme mber the expression, you don™t know what it™s lik
e to be in a fire.  But he wouldn™t dwell 
on how awful it was except to indicate that it 
was unbearably awful and 
constant beatings and 
starvation and filth and dirt and 
crowded and disgusting.  He  indica
ted that but that™s not what 
he dwelled on. What he dwelled on instead in hi
s talking about it was the things that people did 
to survive and the things that pe ople did to help
 each other survive. Th
e image that I had as a 
child of what it was like in the camps was unbear
able sadism and cruelty on the part of the 
Nazis but the inma tes being human, working to do
 things that would ma ke themselves survive 
and things that human beings do.  I don™t mean
 that human beings are pigs and do horrible 
things, but in the good sense of being huma n, that 
is if helping each other and working together 
to try to survive, and so forth.  For example he
 always spoke about what the me moirs all talked 
about, that is the whole business of organi
zation, the whole network through which people 
bargained and traded and bartered 
and traded their bread for other th
ings.  He talked all the time 
of it how it was crucial to trade 
your bread for soap, or to trad
e your bread for an onion or for 
garlic or some thing and soap so you could clean
 yourself.  Onions or garlic so you could get 
vitami ns. All of that which I™ve 
read in umpteen me moirs but he 
talked about that  all the time, 
about the need to trade.  Of course the 
whole network depended on pilfering from Na zi 
stewards and from the suitcases of people who came
 in to be gassed.  So he talked about that a 
lot.  He didn™t  use the word organization as fa
r as I can reme mber but ma ybe he did and I just 
don™t reme mber.  But he talked about that you really
 needed to do that. He 
also talked, in fact 
more importantly than this whole organization bu
siness, he talked about 
holding on to the will 
to live.  My most vivid me mory I have from
 childhood, the most single vivid me mo ry of my 
own childhood is my father talki
ng about holding on to the will to 
live. And that the only way 
you could survive such a horribl e place was to hol
d on to the will to live 
and that™s  how you did 
it, you just  he ld on to the will to live.  Like li
terally held on to it. And every second said, I™m 
going to live, I™m going to live, I™m going to live
.  I just reme mber that vividly.  I don™t  
reme mber what he said how you did it, how you held
 on to the will to live or what strategies he 
used to hold on to the will to live, which I r
ead about in me
mo irs, 
thinking about the past, 
thinking about the future, thinking about this, wh
atever.There are di fferent strategi es that 
people used. That I don™t reme mber, his own personal strategies. But I do reme mber him 

talking about that  -- holding on to the will to live. 
 I also reme mber that of course it made him 

lose all faith in God.Actually I don™t reme mber that
, I take that back.  He
 did lose all fa ith in 
God. But that he didn™t tell me  about.  My mothe r  told me  about that when I was older.  He 
didn™t want me  to know that becau
se he didn™t think that was fair
 to me .  He thought that I was 
a child and not know that he didn™t believe in 
God as a result ofAuschwitz. And he didn™t 
believe  in God because his children had been 
killed and everybody™s children had been killed 
not just his. That didn™t stop 
him from wanting to have a kosher home or from going to shul all 
the time .  He didn™t stop being a Jew, you know what I mean? We ll, actually he did stop going 

to shul until I was born.  From the time the war 
ended until I was born he would not go into a 
shul, he would not do anything religious.  He w
ould not go into a Passover seder, he would not 
do anything religious.  No, that™s 
not true.  He would go to a Pa ss
over seder.  I think that was 
the only religious thing he would do but he woul
d not go to shul. When I was born he didn™t 
even think about it.  He went to shul to name  me
.  He was a Jew. That™s  what eastern Jewry was 
like. You were a Jew. You did things because 
you were a Jew.  Jews named their daughters in 
shul. The angel of death mi ght kill your daughter if you didn™t  do that. You know you had to.  

Just because you didn™t believe in God didn™t mean
 that you didn™t name  your daughter in shul .  
And that broke the ice and he went
 to shul all the time.  He love
d to go to shul.  He absolutely 
loved to go to shul.  He didn™t go every week, he 
wasn™t  religious.  But he went at least once a 
month.  He really loved to go to shul.  In fact 
he even wanted me  to go to a Jewish day school 
but my mother didn™t want me  to go because we 
weren™t that religious and in those days it was 
just orthodox schools.  Getting back to his experi
ences I don™t reme mber that he talked about 

how he lost his faith in God but 
that was a central experience that he  had in the camp s, the loss 
of faith. 
 

Q: Do you remember any discussion of any specific 
episodes or incidents that he mi ght have told 
you or other people? 
 
A: No, I don™t reme mber anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for 
soap which is not a specific incident; I™m sure
 he did it more than once and the business of 
holding on to the will to live and the sense of 
how unbearable it was.  I think in his testimony 
for reparations he did provide some  specific in
stances. But my mother, who unfortunately was 
terrible at details didn™t reme mber them and had 
lost the carbon copy.  I™m sure he was beaten 
me rcilessly ma ny ti me s as was everybody, I me a n he
 wasn™t  singled out.  I™m sure there were 
but I really don™t unfortunately kno
w any very specific thing.  In terms of what he actually did 
in the camp, I assume  he did a variety of labor 
things.  He could be a carpenter so presumably 
when they asked him what do you do, he said I™
m a carpenter and they did have him building.  
My mother used to say that he built crematoria
.  But they were already built by the time he got 
there so I don™t -- see my  mother was really ba
d at detail.  It wa s a shame. I™m a historian 
concerned with detail and she wasn™t. And my 
father died when I was young.  So I™m bringing 
all these me mories of sitting around our table 
listening so I can think of some thing very 
specific. 
 

Q: If you don™t have it that™s okay too. 

 

A: I reme mber that he would be annoyed with pe
ople who presumed -- like if he would discuss -- 
in theWa rsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die 

and they would just eat the horse meat and pe
ople would say, horse, how could you eat horse, 
and he would say, lady, you haven™t been throug
h a fire, you don™t know.  People were in awe of 
my father.  He was a very intelligent ma n and they would sit there sort 
of enthralled with his 
stories.  I don™t reme mbe r  a specific incident 
unless I keep on talking I™
ll come to some thing.  I 

don™t reme mber anything specific.  I do know that 
he was inAuschwitz fromApril of ™43 until 
January of ™45 when the Russians -- so in
 terms of your dates 
through 1944 he was in 
Auschwitz.  In January of 1945 as you know the 
Russians came  very close toAuschwitz.  
Knowing that the Russians were going to be th
ere any mi nute the Nazis evacuated the camp and 
in the famous death march that ElieWi esel and 
millions of other --  Isabella Leitner -- millions 

of other people described -- ma rched off people to
 Germany. And my father was part of that 
death march.  I reme mbe r  him describing that a 
little bit in more detail than the camps.  I 
reme mber him saying that it was very cold.  It 
was January, it was winter, and they didn™t  have 
boots and they didn™t have coats. Two thirds 
of the people died. And I reme mber him saying 
that you coul dn™t fall asleep because if you let yo
urself fall asleep you would die. The snow 
was deceptive.You think that it™s warm when y
ou™re in it and so you c
ould fall asleep. And 
then of course you freeze to death because in fa
ct it™s not warm it™s co
ld.  So you should never 
go to sleep in the snow. And I reme mber him sa
ying that they would force each othe r to stay 
awake.  In so me  of the me moirs I™ve read about how they were put in barns, my father never 

talked about that. He just talk
ed about the snow and how people 
straggled, they would be shot 
of course and the Nazis would b
eat people up.The Nazis were very
 nervous of course at this 
point. He was taken to Dachau. Other people we
nt to othe r pl aces. They were in Bergen-
Belsen, Buchenwald. They were all taken to co
ncentration camps in Ge rmany.  He personally 
was taken to Dachau where he spent the next
 few months.  I don™t know how long it actually 
took him to get fromAuschwitz to Dachau.  In 
some  of the memoirs you r
ead how that part of 
the way they were on trains and trucks and so fort
h.  My father never said that. He just said the 
death ma rch.  He called it the death ma rch and he 
said they took us to Dachau.  So he was in 

Dachau for a few months and he was liberated by
 theAmericans inApril of 1945. And I have a 
couple of little stories that I reme mbe r  of the act
ual liberation.  Not of the mome nt of l i beration.  
Not of the mome nt of liberation although I ha
ve a wonderful story of some body else of the 
actual mo ment but I won™t put this in my father ™s 
record.  It™s  one of those classic stories, the 
other story of how this other person got out of
 Dachau. The Nazis left the camp before the 
Americans got there and he was wandering aroun
d the streets and was almost shot by some  
American soldiers but he spokeYi ddish to them 
and one of them happene d to be Jewish and so 
forth. That™s not my father ™s story.  Right afte
r liberation he and Shia, 
this person who had been 
his employee inWolomi n before the war and had been inAuschwitz with him and had been in 

the orchestra inAuschwitz ac tually, my fa ther wa
s just a laborer inAuschwitz but Shia was in 

the orchestra and they we re in the death ma rch 
together and so forth. And after the war they 
were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten 
potato from the street that he saw and my 
father said what are you doing that for because
 now we have food. And Shia was still too 
scared that there would be no food.  But that agai
n is not my father ™s stor y because that™s not 
what he did.  He of course was nothing at theend of the war.  He was utterly emaciated and 

utterly depleted.  My mo ther used
 to say he weighed fifty pounds at
 the end of the war.  I can™t 
believe that.  But he mus t  have weighed seventy 
or eighty.  My mother 
was also an exaggerator 
a little bit.  But I bet he wei
ghed seventy pounds at the end of th
e war.  He was not a huge ma n 
anyway, he was probably about five
 nine.  He was 
broad but thin. 
 

Q: He must have been strong to ha
ve survived all the labor and all. 
 

A: Yeah.  He was actually old to survive.  Most
 of the survivors were 
teenagers, which is why 
they™re still alive.  My father 
if he were alive today would be
 in his eighties.  I mean he 
happened to die when he was young.  He happened to 
die when he was fifty-three but even if he 
hadn™t died and if he were stil
l alive the m
a n would be eighty-f
our years old.  No, that™s not 
right. Ye s, he would be eighty-fi
ve on his next birthday. Whe r eas most of the survivors that 

you talk to I™m sure are in their seventies because
 they were teenagers or
 in their early twenties 
during the war.  My father was a very old 
survivor, very unusual, he must have been 
extraordinarily strong.  It™s  funny to say that so
mebody in their mi d-thirties would already be no 
longer at the height of their physic
al strength but it™s true.  So it™
s just ama z ing that he lived.  
But anyway he was liberated by theAmericans. 
He did not go to a DP camp which was the 
standard experience but rather 
he  went to work for the Unite
d Nations Relief and Restitution 
Agency and his job for them was to help peopl
e find housing.  He must have learned English 
working for them or before but he lived in an 
apartment in Munich.  He had a real apartment 
and had a real job and sort of 
went about his business.  I assu
me for a few months, I mean I 
assume  that imme diately after the war he was, it t
ook months to recuperate.  
In fact he said that 
it was months before he felt like a huma n being 
again.  I do know that most of his teeth had 
rotted during the war and that one
 of the first things he did when he had some  modicum of 
strength was he just walked ar
ound the streets of Munich and l
ooked for a dentist.  He found a 
dentist, walked in, asked the dent
ist to pull whatever was left  a
nd to give him false teeth. The 
dentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pul
ling and he said, no need.  He was so into pain 
that it didn™t matter.And the German dentist didn
™t  charge him because my father had a number, 
he had been inAuschwitz.  He just showed his 
number.  In fact in t
hose days you just showed 
your numbe r and you got anything.  He didn™t pay fo
r too mu ch after the war. The apartment I 
think was also free. 
 
Q: I was wondering about that because I talked to 
a nu mber of people and they said well we just 
lived there. And I said how did you get food. We ll, we got food. 
 

A: We ll, if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN. 

 

Q: No, I mean in cities. 
 
A: But if they lived in cities -- 
well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before 
that he didn™t have the job from the firs
t mi nute, I think it 
was not a problem. 
 

Q: There was guilt. 

 

A: Yeah, although the Germans didn™t have any 
food. They mu st have been given food by the 
American army of occupation.  He must have ju
st been given it.  I 
don™t know that.  I know 
some body who studies the DP camps, she mi ght know. 
Anyway, so he wasn™t  in a DP camp.  I 
assume  he stayed in Dachau because that™s what they did. They set up barracks and gave 

people food and me dicine and let them come  to th
emselves. We  have pictures of my father 
right after the war, not right, 
right after the war but in ™46 
where he looks fine.  He had 
obviously regained his strength and so forth.  Bu
t so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he 
did have housing and he had a German, non-Jewish
 girlfriend who he lived with which is very 
weird. And she knewYiddish which is very weird. 
 

Q: I heard of some  southern Germans who knowYi ddish actually. 

 

A: We ll, yeah, she was a Bavarian.  She was a b
eautiful woma n. Her name  was Lisa, well probably 
Elizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname.  Just a 
beautiful woma n. Her husband had been a soldier 
probably and he probably had been killed and she 
was probably lonely and my father had access 

to food and people were starving.  She wanted to
 ma rry hi m actually and he couldn™t do that.  

To live with her is one thing, to 
sleep with a shiksa is one thing;
 to ma rry a shiksa after you just 

–.. I reme mber him saying he used to have drea
ms.  His mother would 
come  and beat him up 
in his dreams. The very idea th
at he would even think of ma r r ying a shiksa was -- a Ge rman 
shiksa no else. We ll, I mean from my grandmot
her ™s point of view a shiksa is a shiksa, it 
doesn™t  ma tter what kind.  But the fact that she was also a German shiksa 
didn™t really help.  I™ll 
show you her picture.  She was gorgeous, just be
autiful.  I have this 
huge urge to look her up 
although she™s probably eight
y-five years old, too.  I mean at
 the end of the war how old was 
my father?   In 1947 he was forty right. And 
she ma y have be en ten years younger so she would 
only be in her mi d-seventies at this time .  I don™t know her name . 
 
Q: I think it would be interesti
ng to learn some thing about her. 
 

A: I don™t know her name. Her name is Lisa.  I don
™t  know her last name . Although actually some  
of my father ™s Lukower friends, that is the friends
 from the town that he met again inAmerica, 
they mi ght know her name  because she lived with hi
m. All these pictures of my father and his 
other survivor friends in Germa
ny after the war. There she is, 
she™s with them. My father did 
know Ger man though, he probably did speak to he
r in German. Anyway, so he lived in 
Germany and had this job, joined
 the Zionist organization and st
uff and then in December of 
1947 he came to the United St ates. That was 
right after Congress passed that emergency 
legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi
 persecution.  I guess because he worked for 
UNRRA he was able mo re easily th
an others to get an early seat
 in that. And he came to the 
United St ates in December of 1947 leaving Lisa be hind in Munich.  I don™t think he  ever had 

any contact with her again.  Maybe
 initially he did but not for ve
ry long.  He got hims elf a job 
very quickly.  It was the only j
ob he ever had inAmerica.  He
 actually lived with a Lukower.  
He lived with Mrs. Feldma n who ha d moved to
America God knows when. But her son, Muttel, 
who was my  father ™s  friend in Europe and had su
rvived the war also, and 
was my father ™s friend 
in Germany,  he lived with his mother, Mrs. Fe
ldman.  Muttel came later toAmerica, too.  But 
he lived with Mrs. Feldma n.  He wa ndered arou
nd lower Manhattan looking for a job, he got a 
job right away for a company called Civikoppe
n Minor which did store fixtures, you know 
furniture that ™s inside stor es. 
And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with 

wood, he owned a lumberyard, and he was also ve
ry handy, actually more than handy.  He was 
talented with his hands.  He could build beautif
ul things and so on.  So
 he got a job there, 
initially I guess just as a carpenter since he
 didn™t -- I don™t know, whatever -- but he also 
worked for them supervising job installations. When they did Ba mbergers in New Jersey, he 

went out to Ba mbergers and ma de
 sure the job was done right.  
And what he wanted more than 
anything  wa s to save up enough money to open some  kind of business.  He was an 

entrepreneur by nature and that™s  what he wanted
 to do.  He died before he could do that.  But 
that™s  what he wanted to do.  So he got a job ri
ght away, I mean he probably got a job three days 
-- oh actually I have a funny story to tell.  I know
 you™re mostly interested in the Holocaust but 
I love this story. When he came toAmerica he
 was me t at the boat by his aunt, Judith Marcus, 
Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus. Actually sh
e wa s an aunt-in- law.  She was his mother ™s 
brother ™s wife.  His mother ™s brother had die
d. They had come  toAmerica probably before 
WorldWar I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it moreAmer ican. Anyway his 

uncle was dead but Judith Marcus me t him at th
e boat and she said to him, today I™ll speak to 
you inYi ddish, tomorrow only English.You™re now inAmerica, you have to speak English.  

Presumably he knew some  English because he worked for UNRRA. Today I will call you 

Mendel, but from now on you have to have anAmerican name  and your  name  is Mark.  She 

gave him a name  that was common i nAmerica. 
 In 1947 Mark was a common na me .  So in fact, 
when he became  a citizen in 1951 he changed his name  to Mark.  So inAmerica he was Mark 

Rozenblit, although my mother called him alternat
e–..she called hi m Mark most of the time, 

but she called him Mendel when she was being af
fectionate because that was his name.  Mendel 
was his name.  He was forty-four years old wh
en he changed his name  to Mark. Although he 
used it, it was hisAmerican name . M y cousins ca
lled him unc le Mark and my uncle called him -
- I mean everybody called him Mark. Anyway he 
came toAmerica, was met by his aunt, he got 
a job, and he met my mot her a ye
ar and a half later in June of 1949 and they got ma rried in 
Nove mber of 1949 and they had me  in October 
of 1950. The  rest is history. He adjusted 
extremely well toAmerica.  He lovedAmerica. 
 He felt utterly happy to beAmerican.  He had 
anAmerican wife which is unusual for survivors.  
He didn™t feel the need to be -----of course he 
was friends with all the people who survived from
 his town.   My mother hated them. They 
were a bunch of people who survived from this to
wn. Actually a very large number considering 
how tiny the town was. Vi rtually all of them ha
d been in the Partisans, except for Muttel.  I 
think Muttel had been in the camps.  Everybody 
else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet.  
God, Frimmet, Frimme t and Dave Rosen. They™re so 
unlikely to have been in
 the Partisans, it™s  
amazing. And Chayetta whose son looked like so
me body else, not her husband. There™s this 
sort of crew of people that I 
grew up with. Those people, I ha
ven™t seen them in a hundred 
years. 
 

Q: But they all ended up in NewYork? 

 

A: They all ended up in NewYork, all the survivor
s. There were probably eight of them; it™s  not 
like there we re hundreds of them. 
 But there were some  of t h
em.  Some of them actually 
subsequently moved to Israel.  In the 50™s and 60
™s they lived inAmerica and 70™s and some of 
them retired to Israel. Well Frimmet and 
her husband and the Feldma ns, Muttel and Fanny 

moved to Israel.  But I think Lola
 and her husband, I forget his name , they still live inAmerica, 
in NewYork.  I mean, unless they™re dead, I have
n™t spoken to these people in a hundred years, 
a hundred years, but a long time.  So my father ad
justed very, very well to life inAmerica.  He 
really did.  He didn™t want to have children beca
use he lost two.  He had one because he thought 
it wasn™t  fair to my mother to impose that on he
r but he wouldn™t have any others because it was 
too much of a risk that you could lose your ch
ildren.  In a way I repl
aced his daughter; his son 
he mourned for continuously.  He had nightma res 
all the time, all the time my mother said.  I 
don™t reme mber that.That was from my mother.  He
 was in his daily life inAmerica, fine.  He 
joked and laughed and was successful.  I mean not 
successful in the huge sense but he had a job 
and worked and ma de a living and he was saving money for a business and he had anAmerican 

fa mily.  I reme mber my father being lovi
ng and warm and it was fine in his waking 
consciousness but of course he was racked by ni
ghtmares.  He mi ssed his son profoundly.  He 
was in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah.  He ha
d a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his 
son died just before his own. The loss of his chil
dren was really unbearable to him. The loss of 
everyone else he could handle but the loss 
of his children was unbearable to him.  
 

Q: That must have been a big responsibili
ty for you really to have that position. 
 

A: I felt it an honor.  I felt very privileged.  I fe
lt very special as a child.  I felt that I was privy, 
very close to tis horrible thi
ng that had happened to the Jewi
sh people and therefore that I 
understood it better than others. 
 I felt honored.  I felt terrible fo
r my father and the family and 
so forth.  But I felt very special.  I felt responsib
le, yes, but not in the ne
gative sense of wishing 
that I didn™t have a burden but in the positive sens
e of feeling that I had a special  responsibility 
to bear the infor mation and the pain of it.  I 
knew lots of other people in the same  situation 
though because although my mother 
wasAmerican and therefore all the family that I had was 
American, that is her family, we knew a lot of 
survivors.  Both because of the Lukower, all of 

these people who had survived, but also because
 in Brooklyn in the fifties when I was growing 
up there were survivor s. There were lots of 
survivors.  I had fr iends whose parents were 
survivors. Not all my fr iends, certainly.  In 
fact probably most of my friends didn™t have 
survivor parents but El aine and Esther Rosenberg
™s parents we re survivors and whatever, I don™t 
have to name all the names.  But there were 
plenty of other survivors around so it wa s not an 
unusual or weird thing at all. Bu
t yes I did feel a responsibilit
y, a very great responsibility, 
probably ma gnified by the fact that he died when
 I was ten years old.  I reme mber, my  father 
always talked about it, I do not reme mber a 
time in my life when I did not know about the 
Holocaust. We  didn™t call it the Holocaust, of cour
se, we called it the war, or the camps , or the 
Nazis, whatever. So I don™t reme mbe r  
not knowing about it.  I always knew a
b
out it.  But                               
I do reme mb er the first time  I saw pictures. Th
ere was a series of pi
ctures prepared by the 
American army for Ger mans so they would know 
how horrible the camps were. And my father 
had a set.  In the back it said ﬁZ
o vais in Dachauﬂ  So it was in D
achau.  It was horrific pictures.  
You know those really gross concentration camp pi
ctures from the end of the war when things 
were even worse, because there were bodies 
lying all over the place and so forth. And I 
reme mber I was eleven years old when I came acr
oss those pictures and 
I vomited.  I reme mber 
that very vividly.  I mean this wasn™t  a picture of
 my father, of course, my  father was alive.  Not 
then, he was already dead. Yeah, I felt this gr
eat responsibility because of it, absolutely.  
Anyway what else would you liketo know about the whole thing. 
 
Q: I think that shoul
d probably cover it. 
 

A: As much as you guys need, right. 

 

Q: Yeah.  If there™s anything else
 that you feel you want to include
 for the sake of this interview 
and have it in the museum we can turn off th
e tape and if you think about it, you can tell me . 
 

A: Yeah, I™m just trying to think. You know of c
ourse I™m not the survivor so I can™t  give you the 
details that your survivors are giving you.  My fa
ther also did die when I was ten which me ans 

that I didn™t get a chance to quest
ion him and whatever.  My cousin
 in Israel could only provide 
information about Poland before the war.  My mo
ther was bad at detail.  So it™s a hard thing.  
Let me  just think of a few other things randomly. 
 My father taught me  not to hate all Germans 
because of the Nazis.  He thought the Nazis were 
evil but he didn™t hate all Germans.  I mean I 
think the fact that he had a non-Je
wish girlfriend is a sign of that. 
 He taught me  that.  He taught 
me  that I had to distinguish between people.  Na
zis were evil but not all Ge rmans were evil.  I 
probably di d get the sense that all Poles were 
anti-Se mitic in my childhood. That is, I think 

Polish Jewry in general thought that although no,
 no although. That was the sense I probably 
got.  I got the sense that obviously
 most people were killed but th
at those who survived did so 
not because  they were awful people.  I mean there 
was this notion in certain
 circles especially in 
the fi fties that the people who su
rvived had been vicious and ho
rrible and mean and ha d killed 
each other and been dog eat dog.  Fr
om my father I learned that you survived because you were 
clever. You held on to the will to live so you 
were strong psychologically. You were clever.  
You figured things out. You were lucky, gut
sy. That™s  what ma de you live, not being 
underhanded and mean but being 
tough and strong.  In fact I had a wonderful experience.  I 
went to the fi rst international 
gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact 
gave a paper on it.  I ga ve  a paper on teaching the 
Holocaust at the university level.  But I went 
to not all the sessions but ma ny of
 the sessions.  I went to the fi
nal session which was held at the 
kotel, at the wall, when there were speeches.  Menachem Begin spoke andTe ddy Kollack 

spoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in
 English, really weird.  But anyway English 

was the common language because there were Fren
ch survivors and whatever. Anyway so I 
went to it and it got real cold. 
It was at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a 
jacket and I was feeling very co
ld.  Begin, ma ybe he wasn™t  the 
last speaker, but he wa s one of 
the last speakers and he was going on and on e
ndlessly.  Everybody else had spoken for two 
mi nutes because thee were hundreds of speaker s.  He was going on.  He was already prime 
mi nister.  He was going on and on and he was really
 being nasty.   He was exhorting the crowd 
that if they di dn™t live in Israel  they were traito
rs to the Jewish people.  
It was a really not nice, 
disgusting speech.  Half the crowd st
arted to leave. They just st
arted to leave. They picked 
themselves up and they walked.  MyAmerican side
, that is my Protestant side, I mean I™m not a 
Protestant but you know what I mean, theAmeri
can side that you just stand on line whatever, 
was appalled that they would do that.  Because, af
ter all, even if you hate him, even if you think 
he™s  saying awful things, and I certainly don™t 
agree with Menachem Be
gin politically and I 
though what he was saying was awful.  But still he
™s the prime mi nister of a country. You don™t 
get up and leave in the mi ddle of hi s speech.  It™s ju
st not nice even if yo
u™re cold and even if 
you™re unhappy you don™t do it. And so I was really 
annoyed.  My sort ofAmerican side that 
hates when people cheat on line was 
getting very angry. And then 
all of a sudden 
like I had this 
revelation, wait a second, that™s  w
hy they survived. They just do what seems to them the right 
thing to do. And then I loved them because 
I remembered all these survivors from my 
childhood.  My father ™s dead for a long time and 
I™ve moved away from that world and I just 
loved them and I wanted to kiss all of them.  I 
didn™t leave because I™m not them.  But they left 
because that™s why they not only 
survived but they also succeeded
 after the war in returning to 
normal life. The vast majority of the survivor
s are norma l, functioning huma n beings.  Even if 
they™re a bit neurotic, even if th
ey scream a little too much, even if they have more fe ars than 
your average person, even if they
 are way more over- protective
 of their children, than your 
average person, even all of those 
things and even if 
their children say oh my parents were such 
crazy people, they are functioni
ng huma n beings, they are not lunatics. And the ones who are 
were lunatics anyway. The ones w
ho are were lunatics before the war. This had a searing and 
trauma tic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for 
the most part. There are lots 
of successful business people, su
ccessful professionals. All the 
survivors I know as childre
n all of them ma de it.  Even if they
 were just laborers, they still went 
to work in the morning and they still provided fo
r thei r fami lies. They were fine, they were 
really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that™s  und
erstandable.  But anyway
 so I love them all 
because they are what they are. They survived 
because they have the courage to do what feels 
right at the mome nt instinctively.
  I don™t know if there™s anything el
se I can say at all. This is 
not about my father ™sAmerican experience and that™s of course what I™m most fa miliar with.  

He had a good one.  He spoke English all the time to my mother. They spokeYi ddish when 

they didn™t want me to understand which was e
nough so that I did understandYi ddish.  He was 
fiercely proud of being Jewish 
even if he wouldn™t fast on 
Yom Kippur because he didn™t  
believe in God anymore and he™d gone hungry 
long enough.  But I didn™t know he didn™t fast on 
Yo m Kippur.  He didn™t want me  to know that because ––I mean I™m s ure he would have told 

me if I was older, but I was little.  I think that™s 
all I have to say, at l
east now.  If I think of 
some thing in the next ten mi
nutes we can always add it. 
 

Q: Okay.  I want to thank you very much 
for your time and for this interesting story. 
 

A: You™re welcome, you™re welcome.  Let me add ju
st one last thing.  I know this is not going to 
go into the cards that  you™re doing but somehow the transcript s of these will be saved. 
 

Q: Ye s they will. 

 
A: So I™ll just say it.  My son is name d for my fa
ther.  I™m na med for my father ™s mother and he™s 
name d for my father. And so therefore we ha
ve Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark 
and it™s  very nice. And he really feels connect
ed to my father and to the Holocaust.  He has 
always known about it and you asked me  if I fe el 
a sense of responsibilit
y and I do.  I feel it 
both in my professional life and in my personal life
. And I™ m very pleased that I was able to tell 

my son about the Holocaust in a way like I learne
d about it, in a very personal way, in a way 
that emphasizes the goodness in all huma n beings
 but it also emphasizes that we should be 
careful about the evil that human be
ings are capable of and I feelthat as a child of a Holocaust  
survivor that I have a moral 
obligation to purvey the meaning 
of the Holocaust to the next 
generation and I™m glad I was able
 to do it with my own son. A 
lot of children of Holocaust 
survivors are worried how they 
will do it and I think it can be 
done easily, so thank you for 
interviewing me. 
 

Q: Thankyou. 

 

A: I have one more thing to add, I just reme mb
ered. When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my 
father ™s wife said to him,  escape to the Russian
 zone, you can do that for 
a couple of months in 
September, October, November of 1939; you go escape. After all the Germans won™t  hurt 

wome n and children but they mi ght
 hurt men.And my father said 
well it™s true the Germans 
certainly won™t hurt wome n and children because 
after all his me mories, like most Polish Jews. 
His me mories ofWorldWa r I were that the Ru
ssians were the horribl
e creeps but when the 
German ar my came and occupied Poland the situ
ation of the Jews improved. The Germans 
were civilized and nice and so forth.  So he 
had a sense that the Germans wouldn™t be so bad 
but he didn™t want to go to the east because he th
ought that the Russians would be very barbaric 

and he didn™t want to go to the east.  He said th
e Germans are more civiliz
ed than the Russians.  
I will take my chances with the Germans and I 
don™t want to leave my fa mily alone and so 
forth.  So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the 

detriment of lots of Polish Jews. 
That™s  all I wanted to add– 
 

Q: Thanks. 

 

A: You™re welcome. My father understood that Hitler was a ma niac and that the Nazis were evil 
and that they were doing terrible things to the 
Jews.  He understood that. 
 He just thought that 
ultimately German decency would prevail wher eas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that 

it was at  best  to stay at ho me  with fa mily a
nd take one™s  chances with these Germans than go 
off to Russia.  
 

Q: Okay.
