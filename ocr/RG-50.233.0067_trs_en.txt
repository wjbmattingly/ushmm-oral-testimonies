Abstract 
 
Lillian Lazar, née Guzenfiter, 
was born in Wa rsaw on June 16, 1924 into a mi ddle class Jewish 
fa mily. She was an only child who recalls being pamp
ered. He r father, Jacob, and grandfather were in 
the jewelry business. Her father had been an officer
 in the Polish ar my in World War I. Her mother, 
Natalia, a housewife, was an intellectual like the 
rest of her family. Lillian had dreamed of becomi ng 
Poland™s second fe ma le district attorney.  
 

Beginning in late 1940, Jews had to 
wear the yellow star. She rebe
lled and did not wear the star 
occasiona lly, but was beaten by Polish children. She a
nd her parents were sent to the small ghetto in 
Prosta. Her fa ther got papers as an Ar yan, and left  the ghetto to ma ke papers for his wife and Lillian to 

live as Aryans. Lillian got work at
 the ghetto™s Tobbens factory that 
ma de  German mi l itary uniforms. 
She worked 12 hours daily for one bowl of soup, whic
h she shared with her mother, whom Lillian hid. 
Her mother became increasingl y weak fr
om starvation and a heart condition.  
 

Her mother, extremely weak, left to search for 
her husband. Germans shot her in January 1943. Most 
of their fami ly had been taken 
to the large ghetto, and most di
ed from starvation. When Germans 
surrounded the ghetto, her grandfathe
r took only his prayer shawl a
nd prayer book, and told people 
not to cry. Lillian™s grandparents, all her 
cousins, aunt, and mother were killed.
 
 
Just before the ghetto uprising, Li llian saw a German
 shoot a mother with baby in arms, refuse to 
ﬁwaste a bulletﬂ on a baby, and thro
w the child who ﬁfell in pieces.ﬂ 
 
On May 8, Germans surrounded the factory. Lillian took 
scissors to defend herself. When a Germa n 
saw the scissors, he hit he r with a rifle in the 
thigh, face, and arms, leaving her unconscious. She and 
the rema ining few hundred factory workers we
re sent in cattle cars to Majdanek.  
 

She was beaten there twice, once for trying to ea
t a carrot, and once for tryi ng to eat bread. She 
escaped by hiding in a large pipe th
at was being laid for water or sewage. She got on a train going to 
Skarzysko (Skarzysko Ka mi enna), where she worked
 ma king bullets for rifles. ﬁI guess luck was 
always behind me  watching over me .ﬂ A Ger man soldie
r sneaked bits of garbage to her, and was sent 
to the front lines. She performe d sabotage by appr
oving several bushels of bu
llets that were not good. 
 
She gained freedom on J a nuary 18, 1945, exactly two y
ears after her mother was shot. She says that 
Russians enslaved women they liberated. They
 raped one woma n and she  hanged herself. 
 
She ma rried a ma n she™d known in the ghetto, got pre
gnant, and went to Italy. With their baby, they 
immi grated to Uniontown, PA, which was a ﬁparadis
eﬂ. They had a second child but divorced. Lillian 
says that she and her second husband are very happy together.  

 

She is the only survivor among 109 family me mb ers. 
ﬁYou're always thinking of
 those that perished.ﬂ

Interview 
 
  
001 Anthony: 
Today is December 9, 1991. I am Ant hony Di Iorio and I am at the home of 
Anthony and Lillian Lazar. I'm here on behalf 
of the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum and I am about to interview Lillian 
about her experiences during the time  of t he 
holocaust. Lillian, good morning.  
 
Lillian:  
Good morning.  
 

Anthony: 
Where were you born?   
 

002 Lillian:  
I wa s born in Warsaw, Poland, June 16, 1924 
into a mi ddle class Jewish family. My 
mother's name  was Natalia. They we re called Ka naja and my father Jacob. As far as I 

reme mber, we were comfortable, ma ybe becau
se I was the only child. That's why I don't 
reme mber any discomforts. My father was in the 
jewelry business. My grandfather, my father's  
father, was also in the jewelry business. We  had 
a store in Warsaw. I remember as a little girl 
of three or four years old going 
with my mother to the st ore, 
bringing my father lunch. In 
Poland, there wasn't  the same  way of living as we
 have in the United States that you run out to 
a grocery or to a candy store for a cup of coffee.
 So my mother was bringing my father lunch 
into the store every day and I reme mber going wi
th her. The st ore was quite big. I still have it 
in my me mory a big iron safe, I don't know w
hy I reme mber it, where we always put the 
jewelry for the night and in the morning we'r e 
taking it out from the safe and displaying it. My 
father was more of a businessman, quite successful. I don't think I'm prejudiced, but I think 

quite smart in the business. Well, my  mother's si
de, my mother's father, my mother were more 
intellectuals. Whenever I was going to my grandpa
rents, and it was quite often because I was 
the only girl in the family, they were always 
trying to tell me  stories, trying to teach me  

some thing. It was never just a day spent there 
but my grandfather, the mi nute I came in he 
knew already, to read me  some thing or tell me  a 
story. In the meanti me , they were feeding me , 

I was a bad eater. So always in my me mory the 
stories my grandfather used to tell me . It was 
like two sides of the fa milies -- my fa ther's si
de the business pe ople, my mother's side the 
intellectuals, with the books and stories.  
 

 Anthony: 
Did your grandparents live in the same home or
 did they live in a different house?   
 

026 Lillian:  
In the same city, in Warsaw?   
 
Anthony: 
I mean did they live in the same hous
e as you or did they live separately? 
 
Lillian:
 Separately, but they were the 
best sitters. So whenever my parents wanted to go out in 
the evening, I didn't mi nd. I was going to my
 grandparents, spending a night, a day, or 
some ti me s two days with my grandparents. I wa
s the youngest grandchild and the only girl so 
I was quite pampered. 
 
Anthony:
 Was your mother a housewife or did she work outside? 
 

Lillian:
 A housewife, just helping out in the store some ti me s. 
 
Anthony:
 But an intellectual. 

3
 
Lillian:
 Yes. 

 

Anthony:
 She read books and– 
 

Lillian:
 Always books as far as I reme mber. Ther
e were not too ma ny people at that time 
speaking ma ny languages, but I reme mber my gr
a ndfather. He spoke good Russian; he spoke 
German. My father and my mother spoke French b
ecause my father's sisters were in Paris, and 
they were planning when I grow up to send me  to
 Paris to study and probably they were trying 
to pull me in to listen to the language, or to speak
 it. But just because they were tryi ng so hard, 
I didn't really want to learn French. I don't know for what reason. 

 

Anthony:
 Which languages were spoken in your home?  
 

037 Lillian:
 Polish. 
 
Anthony:
 Polish. No Yiddish? 
 

Lillian:
 My grandparents spoke Yiddish. With me , they spoke Polish. There was always a 

reason for it. In school, if you didn't speak a pe
rfect Polish, the childre
n we re ma king fun of 
you and beating you up because you are a Jew and you don't speak fluent Polish, or with an 

accent, and because they were intellectuals the 
way they were so they we re trying to speak 
Polish with me  so that my Polish would be perf
ect and clear and I wouldn't  have problems in 
school later. 

 

Anthony:
 Did you attend public school? 
 

Lillian:
 I wa s going to a private kindergarten, and as
 a matter of fact I me t my teacher from 
the kindergarten. She's alive and she's in Florida.
 Of course, an old wo
man. After that privat e 
kindergarten, I was going to a public school, wh
at you call here the first school, eleme ntary 
school. After six years of schooling in Pola
nd if you want to go to high school, you were 
automatically transferred to like a juni or high that 
they started at that time . That was four years 

of junior high. If you didn't want to go to high 
school, then you had to go to school for seven 
years. Of course, my mo ther wouldn't hear of 
some thing else but sending her only child to a 
high school so I went only for six years. I pr
etty good and I skipped one year. That wa s, I 
think, thanks to my grandfathe
r with his always helping. 
 

Anthony:
 So your schooling came to an 
end when you were a teenager? 
 

054 Lillian:
 My official schooling came to an end 
in 1939 when the war started, when they 
bombarded Warsaw and when the Germans ma
rched into Wa rsaw. That was the end of 
especially Jewish schools. 
 
Anthony:
 So you did attend high school then? 
 

Lillian:
 At that time , yes. 

 

Anthony:
 Was that a Jewish high school or a public school? 
 

4
Lillian:
 It wa s more on the private side. But only Jewish children attended.  
 
Anthony:
 Was there Jewish religious instruction and so forth? 
 
Lillian:
 If we want to attend, we had Jewish in
structions. Who didn't want to attend could 
walk out from the class and didn't have to attend. 

 

Anthony:
 Was your home a religious home?  Did you observe the kosher laws? 
 
Lillian:
 My grandparents, yes. My parents, no. Bu
t out of respect for their parents, they 
wouldn™t hurt them, so they conducted more or le
ss a traditional home, no
t to hurt the parents, 
but they were not deeply religious people. 

 

Anthony:
 Did you live in a mi xed neighborhood, 
predominantly Jewish neighborhood? 
 
064 Lillian:
 Mixed. 
 

Anthony:
 In downtown Wa rsaw? 
 

Lillian:
 It wa s *Placka Sa ski[ph] 115. 

 

Anthony:
 That's the neighborhood. 
 

Lillian:
 It still exists because I went to visit Wa
rsaw a few ye ars ago. It's there but not the 
same . 

 

Anthony:
 No, of course not. Did you have any experiences with anti-Semitism when you 
grew up in Poland? 
 
Lillian:
 Yes. That was one of the reasons that I ha
d to speak Polish at home . In the elementary 
school, it was all Jewish people so we  didn't 
feel too bad. But ma ny times , the Aryans were 
waiting when we were comi ng out of school and 
chasing us, beating us up, pushing, kicking. 
 

Anthony:
 These are children, Polish children?  
 

Lillian:
 Polish children what they 
did to the Jewish children. 
 

Anthony:
 So they harassed you, they chased you? 
 
075 Lillian:
 Yes and called like filthy Je
w, other not very pleasant 
name s that I really wouldn't 
repeat. 

 

Anthony:
 This is when you were in grade school? 
 

Lillian:
 Yes. 

 

Anthony:
 Did your parents talk about the anti-Semitism in Poland? 
 

 Lillian:
 Not my parents, my grandfather. He was in
 a way alwa ys telling me  stories and trying 

5
 to prepare me that some thing mi ght happen, 
some thing could happen. Little stories that I 
should know what to do, how to react. But how can you prepare some body to know how to 
react if something happens, that I shouldn't be 
afraid. He wanted me  to be careful, but not 
grow up to be afraid. As a ma tter of fact, when
 I fi nished elementary school, I wrote once a 

letter to (at that time  he was like saying here
 in the United States) the President of Poland. I 
wrote letters. I liked to
 wr ite. And I wrote to his wi fe and two daughters. Hi s name  was  
Marshal Pilsudski. He was in comma nd of the 
army. He was very good to Jewish people. As 

long as he wa s alive, it wasn't  so bad. After 
his death, it was getting worse by the mi nute the 
anti-Semitism. And I wr ote to hi m that I would li
ke to attend high school that was mi xed; that 
were gentiles and a few Jews, just to mi x 
with other people. Or ma ybe it was a bigger 
challenge for me  to do it. I don't really know why.
 I wrote that if he could help me  I would 
love to go to a school and the name  of that 
high school was Urszulanli
 [Ursuline]. Who was 
from Poland, from Wars aw knows that name. A lo
t of governme nt offici
als send their children 
to that  school and to me it was a chal lenge that  I will go to that school with them together. I 

was there for a few months. 
 
Anthony:
 So you were admitted to the school? 
 

094 Lillian:
 I was admitted. 
 

 Anthony:
 And how old were you then? 
 

 Lillian:
 At that time , 12, 13. I just started. 

 

 Anthony:
 And he answered your letter? 
 

095 Lillian:
 He answered my letter, and he told me  
that he called up the school and I should go 
with the letter and I'll be admitted. I wrote another letter that  I have a very religious 

grandfather and I wouldn't  be able to attend 
school on Saturday, that's  our Sabbath. And he 
said not to worry about it. Agai
n he answered to go to the sch
ool with the lett
er and they'll 
admit me  and excuse me  from attending school on
 Sabbath. I went to school for a few weeks. I 
felt mi serable because the whole school probabl y ha
d five or six Jewish pupils in it. But right 
in the mi ddle of a session, they were yelling 
that we should go on the 
other side. The Jews 
should sit on the left side to ma ke sure th
at everybody knows who is the Jew and who is the 
gentile. It was really the nicest way of ge
tting your education besi
de being pushed around 
always, up and down the stairs. After a few weeks,
 I decided I wouldn't be able to go on with 
my schooling to a school like that. It's silly. 
You cannot attend it. My ambitions or  my 
challenge came  true. I had enough of it, and I we
nt to a Jewish high school. It was the end of 

that school that were mi xed, the Poles and the 
Jews together. By the way, my father was an 
officer in the Polish army. That was one of th
e reasons it was easier for me to attend that 
school because he was an officer, and I never th
ought being a daughter of an officer from the 
Polish army that I'll be treated in school the way I was treated. 
 
Anthony:
 Did your father know Mars
hal Pilsudski personally? 
 
 Lillian:
 Yes, because he was the chief of the militar y in Poland at that  time, and that  was from

 the First Wo rld War. 
 

Anthony:
 Right. And then President? 

6
 
Lillian:
 Yes. 

Anthony:
 What did you want to be when you grew
 up?  Here you are going to school. You 
obviously ha d ambitions to go this top high school. 
 
124 Lillian:
 You wouldn't believe it what I want to be, at
 that time what I was dreaming of. I read 
once a book. The name  of the book of course in
 Polish was prokurator Alicja Horn. That 
means District Attorney, Alic
ja Horn was her name. I don't know for what reason. According 
to the book, that was the only woma
n district attorney in Poland, and I said I'll be the second. 
 

Anthony:
 You wanted to be the second 
district attorney in Poland? 
 

Lillian:
 I don't know why. 

 

Anthony:
 And what did you parents think of this? 
 

Lillian:
 They wouldn't care less; they would be ve
ry pleased with it if those dreams  would 

come  true. And I was telling my children when
 they were born and old enough to understand 
that that was my a mbition and I would love to
 see them go to law school. Of course they 
didn't. They have other professions. But my younge
st daughter ma rried a district attorney. She 
said you see your wishes will come  true eventually. You didn't go to law school, you di dn't 

become  a district attorney but Wa yne , that's my 
s on-in-law's  name , he we nt to law school in 
Houston, Texas. His first job was 
an assistant district attorney, 
a district attorney, now he's  a 
very famous  lawyer in Houston, a criminal lawyer
. So my daughter told me that my wishes in 
a way came true. It  was fulfilled. 

 

Anthony:
 But not in Poland. 
 

Lillian:
 Not in Poland, and not for myself. 

 

Anthony:
 So you planned eventually to go to a university. 
 
144 Lillian:
 In Pa ris because my aunts, my fa
ther's sisters, were in Paris. 
 

Anthony:
 The Sorbonne? 
 

Lillian:
 Yes. So that was the plan. 
My father was going twice I think he was in Paris, that I 
reme mber. Once was, I think, in '35 that they ha
d a gathering of all the countries like we had 

here in the United States the...how
 do you call it, I forgot already. 

 

Anthony:
 Something political , econo mi c? 
 

Lillian:
 No, the exhibitions. 
 
Anthony:
 Oh, the exhibition, an exposition, okay. 
I think it was in 1937. It would be like a 
Wor l d™ s Fair? 

 
 Lillian:
 Some thing like that. '35 or '37. I hardly reme mber as a little girl. He was in Paris 
trying to prepare the ground that 
eventually [unintelligible] but 
of course it didn't work out.  

7
 
Anthony:
 Did you pay attention to politics when
 you were growing up, when you were a 
teenager? 

 

Lillian:
 Not really. 

 

Anthony:
 How about some one like Hitler one of your neighbors after 1933? 
 
159 Lillian:
 That had already more contact with our 
personal lives because people from Germany 
were sent into Poland. Those were people w
ho were born in Poland and the Germans would 
not accept them as their citizens. Even if they we
re living all their lives in Germany, they were 
sent back to Poland, without money, without an
ything, whatever they could carry, a little 
suitcase with them. After a short while, there 
was no housing for them. In Warsaw, I reme mber 
they had kitchens where they were comi ng, and the Polish Jew was feeding them and giving 

them clothing, whatever help 
they could give them. That's  
how I started paying attention 
what's  going on. 
 

 Anthony:
 So before that you really didn't pay any attention to Germany?  
 

 Lillian:
 Not to politics, no. Not at all. 

 

 Anthony:
 Going to school and growing up. 
 

 Lillian:
 Growing up, playing, having, if you can say s
o, a nice life. Probably because I was the 
only child, I don't know. 
 
Anthony:
 You were spoiled? 
 

Lillian:
 Probably. I don't reme mber, but probably yes. 

 

Anthony:
 Did you have any non-Jewi sh girlfriends in Wa rsaw? 
 

175 Lillian:
 Yes, one boy that lived in the same  hous e 
and was exactly the same  age. We  were 
going to school as youngsters, but as we were 
growing up, the age of ten, he knew already that 
I'm Jewish and that's some thing to look down to, and I knew that he's gentile and I'm not going 

to be treated right by him because he  is not Jewi
sh. It was even hard to explain why. What was 

the difference between us?  Here we grew up toge
ther, we'r e the same  age, but all of a sudden 
our ways were in different direct
ions for no reason, no purpose to it. 
 

 Anthony:
 He was your only non-Jewi sh friend? 
 
Lillian:
 Yes. 

 
Anthony:
 He doesn't  sound like he was a friend. 
 
186 Lillian:
 We  grew up toge ther because we lived in the same  house. You couldn't hold onto non-
Jewish friends. They didn't  want to accept the 
Jewish people as friends
. We had neighbors. We  
were talking with them saying hello, how are 
you, what was going on. I reme mber when I used 
to come  to my grandfather, he had quite a fe
w neighbors, non-Jews, th
ey were frankly comi ng 

8
and talking about politics, what 
is going to happen. But you didn't feel a closeness between a 
Jew and a non-Jew. There was always a looking-downat a dirty Jew. That's  how they called us 

always, dirty Jews. 
 
Anthony:
 Did your parents ever think about
 leaving Poland during the 1930's?  
 

Lillian:
 Not really leaving, ma ybe going to Paris becau
se my aunts, my father's sisters were 
living there. But to leave Poland and to leave 
their parents and their families, no. Maybe for a 
short time , like for a few years and then 
come  back, but not to leave perma nently. 
 
Anthony:
 Did you notice any changes after Marsha
l Pilsudski died?  I reme mber you saying 
that he was considered a friend of the Jews a
nd yet he died right around this time, I believe 
1936 [1935]. Did your parents discuss changes 
after 1936 when different leaders start– 
 
207 Lillian:
 Yes. You couldn't discuss business freely. Like for instance years back when I was a 
little gi rl you could close the stores on Saturd
ay because it's your Sabbath, and keep them open 
Sunday as a Jew. Later on, they wouldn't allow 
us to do this. If you want to keep your business 
open Saturday you can, and even they force 
you to keep it open so people can shop and 
Sunday everything had to be closed if you like it 
or not. That's what I remember the difference 
already. After Marshal Pilsudski died, in the schools we felt it.  
 

221
 The Jewish children were treated di ff erent. Li
ke before, we were not harassed comi ng out of 
schools where later on, after his death it was li
ke a free hand. Do whatever you wanted with 
the Jews. So as little as I 
understood at that time , I knew 
that there is a difference. 
 

 Anthony:
 What do you recall doing on September 1, 1939? 
 

226 Lillian:
 I wa s still in the country. We were usuall
y going in the summer for two mont hs to the 
country like you go here to the Catski
ll Mountains or to the seashore. 
 
Anthony:
 So you weren't in Warsaw? 
 

 Lillian:
 No, not in Wa rsaw. They were talking about
 it and we started pack
ing our things to go 
right back home . They thought that fall mi ght 
come  any mi nute, and I 
reme mber my mother 
was afraid, because my father was an officer in th
e army, that he mi ght be one of the first to go 
back to the service. We  l e ft the country, we 
came back to Wa rsaw before the first, a day 
before. 
 

 Anthony:
 The day before the war broke out? 
 

 Lillian:
 Right. On the first the war broke out. 

 

 Anthony:
 So you were in Wa rsaw? 
 

 Lillian:
 Yes, and I think school was supposed to star
t within two or three days and of course, 
after the war started, the 
first to close were th
e Jewish public schools. 
 
Anthony:
 Now there was a rather fierce ba
ttle for Wa rsaw in September 1939. 
 

9
244 Lillian:
 It took probably a month 
when we saw the Germans ma rching into Wa rsaw. 
 
Anthony:
 Was your father ever called up in the Polish army? 
 
Lillian:
 Before the Germans even came in to 
Warsaw, all the young me n started leaving 
Warsaw. They were afraid that they would be 
called into the army and the Germans are right 
behind them and we heard already that they were
 catching up with the Polish army and some  
they are taking as prisoners and some  they ar
e killing. And I asked who 
are they killing?  Of 
course, the Jew. So who from the Jewish popula
tion was in the army was  killed right away. 
Most of the young Jewish me n including the offi
cers were trying to l
eave Wa rsaw so they 
wouldn't be called into the army because of th
at purpose they knew already from other places 
that that's  what they were doing with the pe
ople that they were catching in the uniforms. 
 

Anthony:
 But your father rema ined. 
 

264 Lillian:
 No, he left for a few weeks, and then he came back. 
 
Anthony:
 But not in the army. 
 

Lillian:
 Not in the ar my. 

 

Anthony:
 What changes did you notice after the war came to an end and the Germans 
occupied Warsaw? 
 

268 Lillian:
 For Poland, the war came to an end very fa
st, after a month or six weeks Poland was 
occupied, the Germans came in. 
 

 Anthony:
 Were you surprised, or wa s your father surp
rised, that the war ended so quickly and 
so disastrously, or was it expected? 
 

 Lillian:
 We  were talking politics more with my
 grandparents, and I still reme mber my 
grandfather telling us Germans are bad, they'll 
hit you or they'll kill you from the back, but 
don't think that the Russians are muc h better.
 They'll hit you in the front, facing you, and the 
Germans wi ll be behind you, but one is as bad as 
the other. He hated the commies and he hated 
the Germans. 
 

 Anthony:
 And he didn't expect the Poles to win? 
 

283 Lillian:
 He didn't expect the Poles to win or to he
lp us as Jews, altogether. As I me ntioned 
before, my mother's side was the intellectuals. 
The schools of course righ
t away they close all 
the Jewish schools. Some schools on the Aryan 
side were functioning, they were open, but no 
Jew had arrived to go to school. But my mother a
nd other people like her would try very hard. 
They hired the teachers fr om those schools with 
the pupils and we had private lessons, not to 
mi ss out on time. They were so gullible probabl
y, and they believed that another few months, 
another few months everything wi
ll come  back to norma l so we shouldn't lose time  and we 
should be tutored privately so we can attend sc
hool after the war is 
over and everything come s 
back to norma l. Each time, the lessons were 
in another friend's house. We were altogether 

about eight or nine kids with 
one teacher and that one teache
r was teaching us
 a little of 
everything. 

10
 
Anthony:
 Were there other changes w
ith the German occupation? 
 
302 Lillian:
 Plenty. 
 
Anthony:
 Could you describe some  of them and how they affected you? 
 

Lillian:
 No food. 

 

Anthony:
 No food. That's a ma jor change. 
 

Lillian:
 That's  one of the ma jor changes. 

 

Anthony:
 You weren't planning on going on a diet then, were you? 
 

310 Lillian:
 No. I was always a bad eater, so I had no
 problems with diets. The Aryans we suppose 
some how they could buy food and in the stores
 was more available for them; where in the 
Jewish neighborhoods there was nothing available. 
 

 Anthony:
 How about your father's  store?  We re there any changes? 
 

313 Lillian:
 The store was closed of course. Nobody 
would buy any jewelry at that time. I 
reme mber he brought a suitcase of the most valuab
le things from the store and he distributed 
everything equally to each one of the closest fa
mily. That mea ns my grandmother, my mother, 
myself, my grandfather, each one of us had a fe
w things always on them in an emergency, to 
have some thing if we need it. 
 
Anthony:
 So you had jewelry in 1939. 
 

Lillian:
 I had jewelry. I grew up with jewelry. 

 

Anthony:
 Did you encounter any Ge rman soldiers in the streets? 
 

324 Lillian:
 As I found out later like our store was 
taken over by Poles and the Germans we re 
there because when my father was trying to go 
into the store quite a few months later in 1940 
already everything was taken over. They were a
lmost trying to kill... How dare could you even 
come  and inquire about your store. You're s
upposed to come  and give everything to the 
German people yourself. The Germa ns gave out or
ders that whatever the Jewish families have 
-- even radios -- everything has 
to be brought to the police, 
and the Germans probably took it 
fr om the police. All silver , gold, all jewelry, ev
en fur coats, radios, everything had to be 
brought into the precinct and the Germans took it 
away. So what we had on us, the few things 
were hidden, and nobody knew about it, but it was 
in case of an emergency or some thing that 
we have some thing to save us from death. 
 

 Anthony:
 So you kept your jewelry? 
 

348 Lillian:
 Not too much. J ust enough for insurance. For one diamond ring, you could get one 
loaf of bread if you're lucky, if some body wants to take that ring from you because there was 

no food so the gold had no value.
 You could buy nothing for it. 

11
 
 Anthony:
 What kinds of things did you have to gi
ve up that personally belonged to you?  Did 
you have to give up coats?
 Did you have a radio? 
 

 Lillian:
 We  had a radio. We had to give it up. My 
mother had a fur coat, my grandfather, my 
grandmother, my father had a fur coat. In Eur
ope, me n were wearing fur 
coats that they were 
lined with fur in the winter because the winter
s we re very strong, very cold winters and me n 
were wearing winter coats lined
 with fur. So everything, right away, was taken away. My 
personal jewe lry as a young kid, a teenager, of 
course right away I had to give it back. 

Everybody knew what I was wearing so they were e
xpecting us to give it back. But still from 
the store we had a few things on us. 
 

 Anthony:
 At any point were you forced to
 wear any identifying badges? 
 

370 Lillian:
 That was later in the end of  '40 when
 the Germans s e ttled down already in Poland. 
Then we had to wear the yellow star. I was, of c
ourse, one of the rebels. I didn't like the idea of 
wearing it, and here and there, 
I was beaten up by Polish youngsters
, so I had to wear it already 
because ot he rwise it was a ma tter of life and death. 
 
 Anthony:
 Occasionally you wouldn't wear the yellow star– 
 
 Lillian:
 Occasionally, if I could, 
I would walk without it. 
 

 Anthony:
 But the Polish children would beat you up. 
 

 Lillian:
 Right. 

 

 Anthony:
 The Germans didn't know you were Jewish. 
 

 Lillian:
 They couldn't tell a Jew from a non-Jew. 

 

 Anthony:
 How did the Polish children know you we re Jewish?  They knew you personally? 
 

384 Lillian:
 They knew from the neighborhood. I don'
t know how. They had a better way of 
recognizing us or sometimes just 
plain trying to get some thing out 
of that person so that if the 
guess is right if they ar e Jewi
sh they would give them what
ever they had on them, some 
money or food or jewelry or wh
atever they could get hold of. 
 

 Anthony:
 Sounds like extortion to me. 
 

 Lillian:
 Like blackma iling. 

 

 Anthony:
 Occasionally, it's been said that Poles ve
ry often, non-Jewish Poles coul d tell who 
was Jewish by the way they spoke Polish. My un
derstanding is that you grew up learning how 
to speak Polish without any kind of accent. 
 

397 Lillian:
 Right. But there was another way. A Je
wish person when you saw a Pole, you were 
walking a little faster. You were looking ar
ound you a little different because you were always 
scared. Somehow they found out or they were
 guessing ma ny times. We  had no documents, no 

12
papers as Poles. If they appr
oached and they asked you are a Je
w, yes?  If you say no, show me  
your papers. If you don't  have any identification th
at you are a Pole, a gen
tile, then you are a 
Jew. So that's how they knew. We  didn't have papers, I suppose. 
 
 Anthony:
 And these were Pole
s that would stop you? 
 

 Lillian:
 They were Poles, neighbors. 

 

 Anthony:
 Germans had never at that point.... 
 

 Lillian:
 Not from the beginning. Germans were walk
ing with Poles to help them identify a 
Jew. Like when they need a Jew for work, it wasn't  the German that found out who was the 

Jew. It was the Pole that pointed
 out, oh that must be a Jew. 
 

 Anthony:
 Now when was the ghetto established in Warsaw? 
 

417 Lillian:
 It started in '41. 
 

 Anthony:
 Do you recall the time  of t he year? 
 
Lillian:
 I think it was in the fall. 

 

Anthony:
 This was after you had to wear the yellow star? 
 

 Lillian:
 Yes. They were trying to push the Jewi
sh population more to one section and the 
Poles, the Ar yans on the other side, the other sect
ions. The ghetto was closed in '42. They were 
pushing in more and more and more, and in th
e meantime, don't forget, that so ma ny were 
being taken away. The Germans we re surroundi
ng two or three blocks, catching the people 
that were there. If they were Jewish they
 would put them on a truck and right away to 

Umschlagplatz and from Umschlagplatz, the trains
 were taking them to different concentration 
camps. 
 
Anthony:
 Did you know of anyone who was taken away during these mo nths? 
 

438  Lillian:
 A lot of our friends. A lot of our relatives.
 In' 42 my grandparents, all my cousins, my 
aunt, my mo ther was killed but that was when
 she was trying. ...I have to go back to the 
beginning. 
 

 Anthony:
 Yes. We 'r e still getting into 
the ghetto now. The Germans... 
 

445 Lillian:
 There were two ghettos in Warsaw. There 
was one big ghetto where there were more 
factories working for the Germans, a nd there 
was a small ghetto where there was one factory 
Tobbens factory. That wa s the small ghetto on Pros
ta. The Jewish people had to live in one of 
those two ghettos. Between the small ghetto a
nd the big ghetto was a 
little bridge-like going 
from one to the other on Leszno. We had to le
ave our homes, everythi
ng we had there, only 
what we could carry that was very litt
le, find a place and move  into the ghetto. 
 

 Anthony:
 Which ghetto were you moved into? 
 

13
 Lillian:
 Part of my fa mily was in the bi
g ghetto. I was in the little ghetto. 
 
 Anthony:
 With your parents? 
 

 Lillian:
 With my parents from the beginning. Later on 
my fa ther left. He got some  papers as a 
Pole, as an Aryan and he left 
to the Aryan side with an under
standing that he'll ma ke papers 
for us and later on we'll be able to go
 out from t he ghetto and live as Aryans. 
 

 Anthony:
 Do you have any idea how he got these 
papers?  Wa s there an underground active? 
 

 Lillian:
 There was an underground, yes, that was tr
ying to help people th
at didn't look Jewish 
and trying to give them some  papers. 
 

 Anthony:
 Were these Jews or non-Jews that were helping? 
 

480 Lillian:
 Jews  and non-Jews together. Now, to get into a factory, you couldn't  live in the ghetto 
doing nothing. Not that there was too much to do, 
but you didn't  have any papers. If a German 
would catch you in the ghetto, the first thing 
is who are you and where are your papers?  If you 
could identify with a factory that works for theGermans, or that you are in any contact or you 

have a connection with some body that does work
 for the Germans, then you got your papers 
and you could get into the factory or whatever 
and have the right to live in the ghetto. If you 
didn't have the working papers, you had no right to 
live altogether. In other words, if a German 

would catch you, you went on the track and they 
took you right away to Umschlagplatz, from 
Umschlagplatz to Tr eblinka, that was the gas ch
ambers where they were gassed and killed. I 
had the luck since I was the youngest in the fam
ily. My grandparents and my parents decided 
to get a sewing machine. With 
a sewing machine, you could get in
to a factory where they were 
making uniforms for the German sol diers. They 
fe lt since I was the youngest in the family... 
 

 Anthony:
 Now you're working in the factory? 
 

 Lillian:
 I had to be in the line with the sewing m
achine for two days. That's how big the lines 
were to get in. They looked me  over to
 figure out if I'm strong enough or young enough, 
whatever, because ma ny people they turned away
. Maybe they were too old, whatever, I don't 
know the reason. They accepted me , and I was o
fficially a worker in the Tobbens shop. 
 

 Anthony:
 Were these Germans? 
 

 Lillian:
 Tobbens yes. Germans, ma ki ng uniforms for the German ar my. 

 

516 Anthony:
 Private sector or were they army?  Th
e people who were running the factory. 
 
Lillian:
 Those were private people 
making uniforms for the army. 
 

Anthony:
 Were you paid? 
 

518 Lillian:
 No, of course not. No pay at all. Once aday they gave us a little soup. That was 
during working hours but we worked 12 hours. 
 

 Anthony:
 So your reward was the working papers and the ration card? 

14
 
 Lillian:
 I had a paper that I'm working in that f
actory. At that time, I was alone already and 
living across the street from that factory becau
se the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller, 
and at the time  they accepted me  in the Tobbens 
factory it was closing already. So we couldn't 
move freely from one place to the other. They ga
ve  us like a family of four or five people 
someti mes in one room. 
 

 Anthony:
 Was the factory in the ghetto or outside the ghetto? 
 

526 Lillian:
 In the ghetto. 
 

 Anthony:
 You were in the small ghetto? 
 

 Lillian:
 In the small ghetto, in the factory working. 
The big ghetto that was connected with the 
small one through a little bridge called Chlodna, 
they had other factories like in one they were 
making brushes, combs, other things probably 
also for the army's supplies. There was a 

hospital in the big ghetto for whoever got sick. Very few people came out of that hospital. 

Who went in, I don't know, probably they we
re killed or they didn't survive. 
 

 Anthony:
 Who were the doctors in the hospital? 
 

534 Lillian:
 Jewi sh. All Jewish, nurses and Jewish doctors. 
 

 Anthony:
 Were there any Germans in
 the ghetto at any time ? 
 

 Lillian:
 Only when they were surrounding a few 
blocks and trying to 
catch people without 
papers. They said that they are 
relocating them to other working 
places. What they actually did 
straight to Umschlagplatz from Ums c hlagplatz 
there were the cattle trai ns that were going 
straight to Treblinka, Ma
jdanek, or other places. 
 

 Anthony:
 You didn't know they were going to Tr eblinka. 
 

539 Lillian:
 At that time , we  were not sure of it. 
 

 Anthony:
 Where did you think they were going? 
 

 Lillian:
 Probably to ot her places to work like I 
was working in one factory, ma ybe they were 
going some place else where they need peopl
e more to work in another factory. 
 

 Anthony:
 Did you know they were going in ca
ttle cars? Did you ever see them?  
 

542 Lillian:
 This we knew. People started escaping fr
om the carriages. That's how we found out 
where they were taking 
them and how it looked. 
 

 Anthony:
 So eventually you began to realize– 
 

 Lillian:
 Putting two and two together, we reali
zed from people that were escaping from 
Treblinka and were escaping from the cattle trains because they were holding them in the 

trains for days some ti me s. They were pushing 
into one cattle train a hundred people. It was 

15
one on top of the other standing. There was no ai
r. The train was close
d, and even the little 
window there that was supposed to be open was also 
closed so the air didn't  come  in at all and 
people were just dying 
in the cattle trains. 
 
 Anthony:
 Do you recall when you first realized that
 these cattle cars were going to such 
terrible places and the people were
 dying on these relocation trips? 
 

554 Lillian:
 That was not too long after I started work
ing. Like I said, my mo ther's sister, my 
grandparents, cousins, they were all in the bi
g ghetto. I was the only 
one in the little ghetto 
with my mother. My father went out of the ghetto
 to the Aryan side to ma ke some  papers for 
us. 
 

 Anthony:
 Who were you living with?  We re you living with your mother? 
 

 Lillian:
 With my mother in one small little room
. In that room was only one bed and a tiny 
little tabl e. 
 

 Anthony:
 You didn't have to share it with others, then? 
 

561 Lillian:
 That was one apartment. And that apartm
ent had probably seven or eight rooms so 
each room had another family. And some body e scaped and came  over and told us what 

happened. My mother didn't work, didn't have a
ny working papers. I was hiding her during the 
day. I was going into the factory. And that little 
soup they gave us in 
the factory was shared 
with my mother when I came  back. There was 
no food to be gotten and the jewelry, whatever 
we had was gone. 
 
 Anthony:
 So you were getting food because you were working in the factory, and you were 
the only source of food that your mother had. 
 
569 Lillian:
 Right. My mother became sick from not
 eating, from being sick, whatever. I found 
out from one of the doctors that lived in the 
same vicinity that she 
had a heart condition. She 
was getting weaker and weaker by the day. I 
reme mber one day I didn't know anymore where 
to hide her and I was leaving the room to go 
to work and an idea came to my mi nd to go down 
to the basement. We had fr om feathers, pillows, and I opened the pillows, and my mother was 

sitting there. I covered her with the feathers
. The Germans wouldn't go near some thing that 
was dirty, so I knew that when they see the feat
hers they wouldn't go into that baseme nt, the 

Germans I mean, being afraid that they would 
get dirty from it and th
ey probably would leave 
it alone, and that's  what exactly happened. Al
ways everybody was being taken out from that 
building where we were living except my moth
er and ma ybe another two or three people. 
 
Anthony:
 Do you recall when this was? 
 

Lillian:
 Yes. That was the end of '4 2 
or the early beginning of '43. 
 

Anthony:
 In the mi ddle of winter? 
 

587 Lillian:
 January. There was no heat. There was no el
ectricity. Water was sometimes cut off, 
too, so the people who were living in the ghett
o wouldn't have almost nothing, no electricity, 
no water, except they couldn't cut off the gas 
pipes and some how some  buildings had the gas 

16
pipes. That was the light at night. I opened th
e pipe and lit a match and the little fl ame that 
came out from the pipe because we didn't have gas stoves or  anything. Don't forget it's Europe. 
In '43 there was no descendant of living quart
ers that it was here. I don't know, the United 

States had stoves, probably yes, but we  didn't. Th
at was the light and the heat, the little fl ame 
that came out from that pipe
 and that pipe was connected once to another pipe, who knows. 
That was the heat and the light
 for the room. Cooking, we had 
nothing to cook and no place to 
cook. Forget cooking. Whatever I brought from that factory when I was working there, a slice 

of bread and that little soup, that's  what we 
had. Once in a blue moon, whe n I could exchange 
clothes or sheets or linen
s or whatever we had left yet in th
at little room, for a piece of bread 
or a potato if we could get it. That's all we 
had, so I was actually the 
supporter of the whole 
household, that was my mother and myself. My cous
ins, aunts, uncles, my mother's sister that 
was in the big ghetto they didn't have much
 more. So it wasn't  like go to some body else, 

ma ybe they'l l feed you. Nobody had. People were dying. You were walking over dead bodies 

in the ghetto like you walk over 
a piece of paper here. It 
was nothing. You were surrounded 
with dead bodies. 
 
Anthony:
 Did anyone die in your building? 
 

Lillian:
 All of them. 

 

Anthony:
 No one you knew. 
 

612 Lillian:
 My grandmother from hunge r, my other rela
tives. My grandfather, he was such a 
beautiful good-looking ma n. I re me mber when th
ey surrounded the buildings, the Ge rmans, 
and they took him out of the building -- my aunt was telling us how it happened. He put on his 

slippers. He said he doesn't  even need shoes 
like he was sure where he
 was going. That that's  
the end. He only took his prayer shawl with hi
m and a prayer book and he told everybody not 
to cry that probably he'l l see us in a differe
nt place. Like the wa
y he sounded like he knew 
where he's going, that that's the end. He doesn't  
need nothing, just the prayer shawl. You know 

that the Jewish people pray with a special shawl,
 a special garment that they put on them and a 
prayer book and that was a good-bye. 
 

 Anthony:
 Were you able to say good-bye to him? 
 

626 Lillian:
 No. I wasn't  there. My aunt saw him. As
 I me ntioned before, my mother was getting 
more sick by the day, swollen from not eating. I 
couldn't get in touch with my father. I didn't 
know if he was alive or not. He couldn't get in to
uch with us or probably 
he wasn't  alive either, 
who knows. The whole family that was with us
 in the ghetto was gone except my aunt, my 
mother's sister was still alive a
nd one of her sons that was livi
ng in the same  building with her 
in the big ghetto. I asked the doc
tor what to do with my mother. 
She's so sick I couldn't even 
move her out of bed anymore. She had a heart co
ndition. So he said that 
if she would be able 
to get into the hospital for a few days they woul
d help her a lot and she 
would be able to come  
back and be all right again.  
 

641 
I got in touch with my a unt because my mother 
suggested that she wanted to get in touc h with 
her, go into the hospital for a few days to get 
me dical help. There was no other way of getting 
any me dical help. There was no me dicine except 
in the hospitals. They had a little something. 
And then my mother said that she'll go out on 
the Aryan side to look for my father who got 
out. We  can't survive here any longer. There 
was no way of transportation to go from one 

17
place to another. They had rickshaw
 -- a little like a bicycle with
 in front two seats and that's 
how one was driving that bicycle taki ng you from 
one place to another. So I put my mother in 
that rickshaw that she wouldn't have to walk 
to go across on that little bridge that was 
connecting the small ghetto with the big ghetto and 
the next day trying to 
get in touch with my 
aunt to call her if my mother's there, should I 
come  too if she's going to the hospital or what 
she decided. If she wants to go to see my fath
er to look for him or where she's staying and I 
found out that my mothe r  was shot
 crossing the bridge by Germans. 
 
Anthony:
 Trying to go fr om the s ma ll ghetto to the big ghetto? 
 
658 Lillian:
 Right. My aunt was waiting for her, her si
ster, in the big ghetto 
and they were trying 
to figure out what to do, how to get me dication 
or go across to the Aryan side. When she heard 
that my mot her was shot she got 
a heart attack and on the spot  died
 together with her sister. So 
I was left all alone with nobody. 
 

 Anthony:
 Was your mother alone when she was shot? 
 

 Lillian:
 Yes. 

 

 Anthony:
 No reason? 
  

665 Lillian:
 No reason whatsoever. The German just decided with the rifle whoever was at that 
time, at that moment on that little passage wa
s killed. And my  mother was just one of them. 
That was January 18, 1943. 
 

 Anthony:
 How did you find out about this? 
 

670 Lillian:
 The next day when I was trying to get in t
ouch with my aunt if 
my mother arrived,if 
they'r e going across to the Aryan side or if she 
can get some  me dication or if she has to go into 
the hospital or if I should come  over. I found out 
that my aunt is dead. Her son answered that 
she's dead. She got a heart attack when 
she saw what was happening to my mother. 
 

 Anthony:
 So your cousin told you. 
 

 Lillian:
 Yes. And by the way, my cousin a few week
s later wa s killed by a German thought he 
was hiding in a bunker. The Germans came. The y
 took everybody out of that bunker. That was 

during the uprising already in Apr
il and they killed him too. I was le
ft all alone in the ghetto, a 
teenager, 15, 16 years old. But my 15 was like no
w 10 or 8. I was always sheltered. I was the 

only child. I never had to work. I never had to 
take care of my self. I didn't even know how to 
prepare anything. So it's not like a mature 15, 16 y
ear old now but it's like an eight-, ten-year-
old child. 
 

 Anthony:
 By now you had learned how to sew. 
 

 Lillian:
 No. 

 
 Anthony:
 So you were working in the factory 
-
 
 
687 Lillian:
 I was working there. I remember I put 
on a button nobody could button it. I didn't 

18
know how to sew. 
 

Anthony:
 So you did a bad job? 
 

689 Lillian:
 I did a bad job so I got a slap or a smack. They hit me, and then some body else was 
trying to put on the next button 
to show me  how to do it the ne
xt time , and I learned little by 
little. Not to be a professional. Then they gave me
 another job to pin the 
things with pins -- the 
clothing that had to go under the machine. Beca
use I didn't know how to sew, so I would be 
better with the pins putting two 
pieces of fabric like together
 with a few pins and somebody 
else did the sewing so I was doi
ng that for a while, and I was 
better at pinning it. That was 
already the end of winter 43 and we heard that
 some thing is going on in the big ghetto, and 

people are starting to rebel. They know what
's goi ng on. We didn't believe it. We couldn't 
believe the horrors that we heard, that it's impo
ssible. Why would they do this to innocent 
people?  They would just kill and take  them to gas chambers. 
 

 Anthony:
 The rumors were of gas chambers? 
 

703 Lillian:
 The rumors were there because peopl
e were escaping and comi ng back but nobody 
could really believe in it. It's  impossible. Th
e stories were so terribl e. One day, it was after 
walking in the street in the big 
ghetto, I was trying to get in touc
h with my cousin he was still 
alive at that time and again they
 were surrounding four or five 
blocks cutting off from the rest 
and whoever was there without any papers th
at is working someplace or belonging someplace 
they were putting them on the trucks and straight
 into the cattle trai ns
. And I see the Germans 
screaming and killing people, and that I'll never 
forget I guess for as long as I'll live. In the 
street, a mother was running with a baby and he
 killed the mother. She wa s willingly going to 
the truck to be taken away but evidently she 
wasn't  running fast enough or  whatever. He killed 
her. She fell down and the little baby was there 
next to her crawling and crying. And another 
German was standing next to him, he was pointin
g at the baby, to kill the baby and he said 
some thing in German that for a baby you're not 
wasting a bullet. He took the baby [Mrs. Lazar 
was in tears] by a leg, threw it in the air and s
howed the other German that's what you do with 
babies, you're not wasting bullets on them. I 
was with a small group of people that had 
working papers that we'r e working in that fact
ory so we had to stay 
there and wait and watch 
them. We  couldn't even put our heads down. 
We  had to keep our heads up and look. 
 

 Anthony:
 These were SS? 
 
Lillian:
 SS. 

 

Anthony:
 And then came the rebellion. 
 

741 Lillian:
 I don't think you can ever get it out of your
 mi nd. But  I don't talk about it. It's dead, 
buried in your subconscious mi nd but when you 
start reme mb ering and talking about it, it 

come s back. 
 

 Anthony:
 This is the first time you saw some body 
killed right in front of your eyes. 
 

 Lillian:
 Yeah, and I had to look at it. I heard sh
ot s. I saw people falling down, being killed. 
But I never saw anybody taking a baby by a leg thro
wing it in the air and the baby fell in 
pieces. I left the ghetto at that time and went back
 to the little ghetto to go to work. That was 

19
June. Sorry. 
 
 Anthony:
 So you were ready for the rebellion? 
 

755 Lillian:
 Yes. The rumor s  were what they were do
ing in the gas chambers and in the showers 
and I witnessed it myself already and was telli
ng others what I saw. And as we were putting 
two and two together, we were ma king sure in 
our mi nds that that's  actually what was going 
on. Who wa s next. That's  the handful of people that
 is left in that fact
ory. It was a few hundred 
of us. That was all that was le
ft and those are mo stly teenagers, the ages between 13, 14 up to 
20, 21, 22. The younger ones that looked older 
and were very developed, some how the 
Germans accepted them more as the healthy el
ement to work because they were young and 
well-developed. None of the older people a
bove 35 were accepted by Germans as working 
element. So we were a few hundred left in our 
factory thinking of what to do. After dark, we 
couldn't work anymore. We had to be in our 
rooms. There was no food. People were lying in 
the streets crossing over dead bodies. 
It was an every day incident.  
 

770 
In the beginning of April, we had the big ghe
tto getting ready for an uprising. We  knew that 
some thing is going on, but there's nothing to fight with. There was no ammunition, nothing. 

How can we  ever defend ourselves if we have
 nothing to fight with to defend ourselves. We  
said that whatever they'll decide  to do, they shou
ld let us know that we want to be part of it,  
the little ghetto w
ith the big ghetto.  
 

786 
April, I think, the 19th, I got up 
in the morning, and I saw flames from the big ghetto. You 
could see the flames wer e  there. Something 
was going on there. And, as we later found out, 
the big ghetto was trying to defend themselves, 
and wouldn't let the Germans in. Probably it 
took them fi ve or six weeks. They wouldn't 
let the Germans in through the ghetto gates. 
Fighting with whatever they had. Wh at we 
had there was no ammunition at all. Throwing 
bottles or handma de ammunition, whatever they 
could get for the little 
they had to offer, 
money or jewelry.  
 

802 
There was very little help from the outside
. The underground was working some how together 
with the Jewish people, but rea
lly not helping. I don'
t know if t hey didn't have the money or 
didn't have the power to help, but
 they didn't give us anything 
to protect ourselves. After six 
weeks or so of fighting, the big ghetto wa
s in ruins. Everything was burning down. The 
Germans couldn't get into the buildings. The people were fighting, throwing hand-ma de 

bombs, so they were afraid to approach a build
ing. What they did was tr
y to burn one after the 
other, and they felt that the fire would burn th
e Jews alive and some how ma ke a way for them 
to come  in. It was unbelievable. We  felt good wh
en we heard that the Germans are actually 
afraid of that handful of Jews to go into th
e ghetto. But it was the truth. They did not go into 
the ghetto.  
 

822 
The beginning of May, when the big ghetto was almo
st finished, we heard there are still a few 
people hidi ng someplace in the bunkers. The bunkers were places that they built for 

themselves in a cellar some place or in a corner wherever they could cover it up that nobody 

knew that a place exists there. There was room
 enough in a bunker for somebody to sit or to 
stand stiff without moving or to
 lay down without being able to
 sit down, just like you ma ke 
room for a coffin to put in. Even those bunkers
 the Germans found and killed whoever they 
got hold of and in one of them was my cousin 
that he was killed too one of those bunkers. It 
was the last one of my family that was killed.  

20
 
840
 So now I'm the only one. Not even any friends fr
om my school that I went
 together with were 
alive. They were all transported to the ga
s chambers. So according to our knowledge, there 
was nobody left in the big ghetto, just a few bunke
rs ma ybe if the people could survive. How 
could they survive without food and without wate
r?  What the Germans di d at the mi nute they 
cut the gas pipes so they would be poisoned 
by the gas whether could survive some place or 
not in a baseme nt. So the gas finished them, 
and then they were throwing in whatever was 
flammable so the gas exploded. So the fire was 
spreading from one building to the other. On 
the eighth of May, that's another da te that 
I don't know why because we were living without a 
calendar, but I remember for th
e rest of my life -- the Germans came to our factory. We were 
like the last ones already a few hundred people th
at was left. They surrounded the factory. We  
didn't even go home anymore to sleep like we we
re working constantly, being afraid to leave 
the place. The factory, if we leave, would be caught in the street and sent out right away to the 

concentration camps or gas chambers or wherev
er they sent at that mo me nt. So we were 
actually staying and working continuously. They
 told us to leave everything and come  out 
from the factory in a big courtyar
d that was next to it. The rumor spread from one to the other 
-- don't go, defend yourself just like they did in the big ghetto.  
 

873
 How can you defend yourself if we have nothing  to defend ourselves with?  I was working at 
that time by the uniforms and some how I see a pair
 of big scissors on th
e table. I grabbed the 
scissors thinking of it 
-- I had to defend myself with wh
at. I found the scissors. I'll defe nd 
myself with the scissors. We 'll fight. We 'r e not
 going. And in the meantime, the Germans start 
yelling that we should co
me  out fast, come  out to that cour
tyard. And I'm going with the rest -- 
not going but you're being pushed actually out wi
th the scissors and the German sees me 
walking with the scissors he come s over. What is
 this?  I didn't  know what to answer, before I 
had a chance even to answer, with the rifle hestarted hitting me . He hit me  here and I have a 
big scar he re on my thigh. Then he hit me  in th
e face. Here is the scar. And I covered my face 
and the blood was running. So here I had a third s
car. He hit me . He almost broke my arms, or 
ma ybe he broke, I don't know. And that's when 
I lost consciousness. The blood was running, 
probably they wiped off, whoever was next 
to me  wiped off the blood from me . I don't 
reme mber how I arrived in Majdanek. 
 

 Anthony:
 So your girlfriends picked you up and took you. 
 

894 Lillian:
 They dragged me just into the train, how
ever they took us, into Majdanek. Because 
the whole lot whatever  was still alive went to 
Majdanek. I woke up actually
 in the cattle trai n 
when it stopped in Majdanek. I cam
e to, and one of my friends that
 was next to me  told me  to 
cover my arm and to cover my leg so they w
ouldn't see the scars. In the meanti me, the face 
was bleeding. They washed me  up. And I came out 
from those cattle trains. I think I was there 
probably 24 hours because they came in the morn
ing and they took us out. I was unconscious, 
they said, the whole night, so it must have been
 the next day when I w
oke up still in the cattle 
train. 
 

 Anthony:
 This would be May 9th you 
were in the cattle trai n? 
 

911 Lillian:
 But probably 24 hours because they said I 
was the whole night unconscious and they 
gave up already. They thought that I'm dying 
but some how I survived. There was still a 
selection. 
 

21
 Anthony:
 This is after you get out of the car? 
 
 Lillian:
 Right. 

 

 Anthony:
 Your face had been cleaned and you covere
d your arms when you were in the car? 
 

916 Lillian:
 They told me  to put the cloth over my 
arm and my leg and my ar m was covered. And 
I said, but what will I do with my face. It's a 
big scar there all cut up. Hold it with your hand so 
nobody will see it. And I was holding it and that's
 how I passed. We  went in, we washed up 
luckily they were going left and 
right and left and ri
ght and I was the one that had the showers 
not with gas but with water. We  survived. We  
wa shed up. They gave us clothes. The clothes 
were spitefully. For a small person, they gave big clothes. For the big ones, they gave very 

small clothes so nobody could put nothing on to
 look like a huma n being. They looked like a 
circus. 
 

 Anthony:
 Clowns. 
 

932 Lillian:
 Clowns. Luckily I was small, so I got a bi
g garment and I could tear pieces to ma ke 
bandages out of. So that's how I was the lucky 
one. There was no me dication of course for a 
Jew. There was the Red Cross but they didn'thelp us. They would give me dication for the 

Poles, for the gentiles. Majdanek had political
 prisoners. They had Russian prisoners. They 

had gypsies. They had communists. The Red 
Cross was helping ever
ybody except the Jews. 
 

 Anthony:
 So the Red Cross was at Majdanek? 
 

945 Lillian:
 Yes but not the Jews. The Jews they didn't  help. 
 

 Anthony:
 What kind of help did they give these people? 
 

947 Lillian:
 They cleaned them up if the y were cut up
 with some thing and th
ey let them go. They 
wouldn't keep them there. There was a hospita
l, but nobody wanted to go into that hospital 

because whoever went in wouldn't come  out alive,
 but at least it was the 
first aid. I was getting 
infected from the wounds that I had. I reme mbe r friends, older people that were in the same  

group with us, they told me  that ma ybe the onl
y thing that is good to keep it clean because 
there was no medication to get leaves and cove
r the wounds with leaves
. Maybe this will help. 
I was still running a fever from ti me  to tim
e which me ans I wouldn't be able to work. 
 

 Anthony:
 What kind of work were you doing there? 
 

962 Lillian:
 In Majdanek, there was no work. We  were 
carrying stones from one place to the other 
like one day carrying it one place and the next 
da y bring them back. The stones were heavy -- 
even for three people would be too heavy to carr
y or push that little wagon that we had and 
here one had to do it. Some ti me s here and there 
one or two were lucky that were picked to 
work in the kitchen or segregate the clothes lik
e shoes, glasses, coat, 
silver. They separate 
piles out of it. It was at  least a little easier 
work than to carry the 
stones, and ma ny of us 
among clothing or pictures their own friends or relatives because it was the same  time that we 

came and their belongings we had to segregate. 
We didn't know it that time , but later on we 
figured out how come  if my cousin or my a
unt left a month earlier
 and here I'm finding 
some thing that I recognize belonged to some body, 
relatives or friends. That's  what they did. 

22
They'r e not alive anymore. So we knew already for sure what's going on. 
 
 Anthony:
 Did you discover any clothing or
 items of people that you knew? 
 

989 Lillian:
 I discovered pictures, but you couldn'thold on to them. You couldn't keep nothing. 
You were beaten up right away. These are photos. 
 

 Anthony:
 Yeah. 
 

993 Lillian:
 Photos of relatives or friends from the 
same  ti me  approximately that they were 
ma king the segregations, and we knew that they 
were supposed to take them to another place 
of work, but then we figured out that was the wo
rking place where they killed them in the gas 
chambers because they'r e not here anymore. 
 

 Anthony:
 When did you suspect there were gas chambers at Majdanek? 
 

000 Lillian:
 The smell was terribl e. 
 

 Anthony:
 So, imme diately? 
 

002 Lillian:
 After a few days. Men were working and 
cleaning up the gas chambers. There were 
five divisions. Four were for me n and the fi
fth was the wome n. And some how, as we were 
going from one place to the other to work or 
something, we exchanged ideas or notes. Oh, do 
you know what happened to this and this one, or
 did you see that one or you heard what's  
going on now?  Now the ovens are on. Don't thi
nk that they'r e cooking there a meal for you. 
Those are your relatives and those are my rela
tives. I was working there. I know what's  going 
on. Like here and there sentences that we st
arted realizing what's
 going on. Usually, they 
wouldn't let people work there more than a 
few days. They were killed on the spot or 
exchanged like to another part of Majdanek fo
r another work. Those that were stopped from 
one work and sent to another could excha
nge ideas or whatever gossip was going around. 
That's how we found out, one from t he other. 
Like let's say if I was working selecting the 
clothes, and another group of me n wa s pa
ssing by, and you could whisper some thing. You 
know, I was working with clothes and I found this 
and this clothes. Is she alive some place?  So 
they were laughing yeah she's alive in the cr
ematoriums because I come from there. I was 
working there four days and they
 all gassing them in the showers.
 Instead of the showers, the 
gas comes out, they'r e gassing them and sometimes
 they'r e half alive and they'r e putting them 
straight into the ovens. That's  how we'r e fi
nding out, by exchanging the gossips and the news 
that we had from each other. 
 
Anthony:
 Could you see the gas chambers and th
e ovens from where you were staying. 
 

Lillian:
 Yes. They had very high big chimneys and you could see the smoke comi ng out. 

 

Anthony:
 Where were your living qua
rters like at Majdanek? 
 

045 Lillian:
 It wa s one huge room with to explain to
 you for people that didn't see it like bunk 
beds. One on top of the other but here you have 
two bunk beds one on top of the other. We  had 
three. On each bed were three or four people.
 On one side two and on the other side two. You 
couldn't turn. When you had already your bunk be
d and you're lucky as we  came in those bunk 

23
beds were occupied and we were sitting on a 
stone floor or standing 
and to sit down everybody 
had to be willing to sit down because we were so
 tight together as a gr oup that one couldn't sit 
down by hims elf or by herself. You would be
 stepped on or squashed to nothing. So 
everybody had to do the same  thing. If you sit 
down and then you want to turn around, 
everybody had to turn around. 
 
Tape II, Side A 
 

 Anthony:
 So we were describing the big room - 500, 600 wome n. 
 

001 Lillian:
 No water, no toilet facili
ties nothing in the room, just 
a stone floor. One big barrel 
that's supposed to be the toilet for ev
erybody. During the day you could go out to the 
outhouses that they had, but the mi nute it got da
rk, you were not allowed 
to leave that barrack, 
whatever they called it. Of cour
se, that one barrel that was pu
t by the door in that room was 
not enough for 5, 600 wome n so it was always overflowing, the smell wa
s unbearable. Cold, it 
was winter, early wint er. 
 

 Anthony:
 So you were there from M a y 1943 through the winter. 
 

012 Lillian:
 Through the summer, starts the fall. Mo
nths I don't know. Nobody had a calendar. I 
just know when they came  to take us out of 
the ghetto. That was the last day of the ghetto 
uprising. 
 

 Anthony:
 Then it was warm. 
 

015 Lillian:
 It wa s May the eighth 43. One day we had so
me  news that they put in some  pipes. 
They were supposed to be water pipes or sewer 
pipes, we didn't  even know. We  were carrying 
it from one place to another. As we were walk
ing there, the wome n, we got one idea.  The 
pipes are big, ma ybe we can hide, and on the ri
ght time, ma ybe we would be able to escape 
some  place. There was a group of us that we 
decided there is nothing that we can lose. 

Another few weeks without food. Getting up when 
it's dark, so it's dark, so probably it was 
three or four o'clock in the morning. It was da
rk, yet when they woke us up to stay on an 
appeal that we are counted ev
ery single day the same  for 
hours till a German SS ma n or SS 
woma n ca me to count us, and some times you were 
standing there and we had to stay stiff like 
for three, four, five, six 
hours, rain or shine.  
 

030 
They didn't give us too much even of food, a littl
e colored water we called it that was to wash 
up and to drink and to eat. That was the breakfa st. 
A little cup of that water, whatever it was, I 
don't know. At lunchtime, it was some  s weet soup 
ma de out of who knows what but the taste 

of it was sweet. Later on during the day, one slic
e of bread that was as heavy as stones, it 
wasn't  even ma de out of flour. I don't know what
 it was ma de of, dark and terribly heavy. The 
gossip was going on later on that some  of the soups were cooked with huma n bodies. So we 

knew that we cannot survive much longer under t
hose circumstances, being beaten up every 
day for no reason. I was beaten up once. I was ta
ken to clean up a little garden for a German 
that was in front of her house. 
 

 Anthony:
 Her house? 
 

044 Lillian:
 Her house. An SS woma n. With another 
few wome n. And as I was cleaning, I saw 

24
carrots growing there. I was so terribly hungry, 
not eating for days when I saw the carrot. Of 
course, I grabbed the carrot and put it in 
my mouth. The SS woma n probably saw it. She was 
riding a horse. On the horse, she came to me
 and started screaming and be ating me  up. I 
should spit out what I had. She saw me  s wallo
wing the carrot. So I wa
s beaten up till I was 
half unconscious. 
 

 Anthony:
 How did she beat you? 
 

052 Lillian:
 With a whip. With a whip from the house. 
 

 Anthony:
 Is this the woma n whose house it was? 
 

053 Lillian:
 I don't know if it was her house or not, 
but she was on a horse riding around and she 
must have seen me  eating that carrot. Another ti
me I was beaten up I had 
in my mouth thatlast 
piece of jewelry, a little diam
ond, a tiny little diamond, a ring with a diamond and I was 
keeping it in my mouth when I 
was afraid that some body would s
ee it on me  and that piece of 
jewelry I exchanged for a slice 
of bread. In Majdanek, the Pole
s were comi ng there to work 
too, in the kitchens, in the offi
ces. I don't know what kind of wo
rk they did, but not the same  
work that we  did, Jewish people. And one gave
 me  a slice of bread for that diamond ring. You 
couldn't save it for later because you wouldn't ha
ve it anymore. There was no place to hide or 
to save. So as I got that slice of bread, I put 
it in my mouth and one of the Germans must have 
seen me  eating it and also ran over what I'm 
doing there. I said nothing. What you have in 
your mouth? So I'm trying to swallow it as fast 
as I could but they saw 
me swallowing it, and I 
was beaten up again. 
 

 Anthony:
 By the German guard. 
 

070 Lillian:
 By the German guard. 
 

 Anthony:
 And these guards at Majdanek, they'r e all Germans or did you notice whether they 
were– 
 

071 Lillian:
 They were a few so-called Volksdeutsche. 
Those were Germans that they claim that 
they were born in Germany or they come  from
 German parents or they were born in Germany 
living in Poland some thing like this. So they 
were working there too. So we knew that we 
could not survive there, and we knew alrea
dy what was going on. And that group, those few 
young girls, we said that one night when it's ra
ining and that they'r e not going to count how 
ma ny of us are still alive or whatever, that ma
ybe we hide in one of those pipes and we  can 
escape some place. One night came, a very dark
 raining ni ght, and we were hiding in the 
pipes. A few heard the Germans yelling, screaming.  
 

089 
They were counting or they were trying to te
ll the people to get in 
line to go back to the 
barracks, and one of them ca me  out from a pipe was shot, killed on the 
spot. Another two were 
killed a little bit later. I was still hiding in one
 pipe with one other gi
rl. It was already very 
dark and quiet. 
 

 Anthony:
 This was the next night. 
 

093 Lillian:
 That was at night, the mi ddle of the night 
probably or the next night. We  decided it's 

25
safe to look out, ma ybe the Germans aren't
 around. Around Majdanek farther up where the 
home s of the Germans that were watching the ca
mp, there was no place to escape. We realized 
that later. Without clothes 
and without proper papers, we could go nowhere. As we were 
walking, we found the railroad station and agai
n a transport going to a camp to Skarzysko 
(Skarzysko Ka mi enna). They were there bei
ng counted and standing 
and again standing and 
being counted. We  got into that transport 
when nobody looked around pret
ending that we are 
one of them. We  asked where they'r e going. They 
said that they are go
ing to a factory for 
work. They needed some workers and they picked them to go there to work and we were one 

of them. At that point, at that
 time we  didn't know if we are the lucky ones to go to another 
working place or to another con
centration camp a nd be killed. 
 

 Anthony:
 And you had no idea where this place was? 
 

109 Lillian:
 No. But there wa s no way out to escape anyhow
. So what difference is where we go if 
we'll be killed today or the next day doesn't
 ma tter anymore. We knew that is comi ng any 
mi nute. As it came out we went to a muniti
ons factory Skarzysko (Skarzysko Ka mi enna) 

where they were ma king the ammu nition for, th
e part I was in, for rifles. I guess luck was 
always behind me  watching over me . The part that
 I was assi gned to work was the last  step 
almost where they put the bullet on a scale. If the bullet reaches a certain size and a certain 

weight if it™s okay then it goes one place and if 
it's not, then it goes 
another and then it goes 
into the boxes and being packed. So that was lik
e the last step of packing the bullets. We had 
to work with white gloves because the finger ma
rks on the bullets would dama ge the weight of 
the bullets. And I was working th
ere. Again we had one big room with the bunk beds sleeping 
like herring one next to another. Food was a li
ttle better than in Majdanek but not too much 
more. We  were working around the clock, some tim
es night shifts, sometimes day. The rumors 
were going around if we can do something to dama ge
 the bullets would be 
very helpful for us. 
That was from the underground. 
 

 Anthony:
 So the underground had contacts in the factory? 
 

134 Lillian:
 Here and there, yes. Some  Poles were co
mi ng into work too, in the same  factory so 
they were spreading the rumors and telling us. 
 

 Anthony:
 Were you all wome n again in this factory? 
 

 Lillian:
 Yes 

 

 Anthony:
 Were they Jewish or were they non-Jewish? 
 

137 Lillian:
 Jewi sh. The supervisor s were only the Poles, gentiles. But the workers were all 
Jewish. Sometimes me n were comi ng like when th
e bullets we re packed already in the boxes 
to take outside into the trucks, the boxes. So
me times me n we re comi ng to take it, transporting 

from one place to the othe r. But where I was in that place were only women. They called that 

part We rk [Factory] A. There was a Werk B a
nd C. We rk C people were getting yellow from 

the powder they were using for the bullets a
nd dying like flies. N
obody survived too long on 
that We rk C they called it. We rk A and We rk
 B people survived longer. The powder, the 

gasses, whatever they used, were not as dangerous for the body as the other.  
 

152 
Once I had a lucky incident with one of the Germ
ans. I guess it™s worth to me ntion it that here 

26
and there maybe that there were some  human be
ings. I was working as I said before with 
white gloves, you couldn™t touc h the ammunition a
ny other way, just in gloves, and I hurt my 
finger in the machine and all of
 a sudden I see the gloves are 
getting red fr om blood. I must 
have hurt it badly. A German passes by. He sees 
me  and he s a ys in German, wait, don™t do 
nothing. He come s back in a few mi nutes. He gave
 me  another pair of clean gloves to put on 
and at first he tells me  to put them on that 
nobody should see it. In the meantime, I stopped the 
blood from my finger, put on the other gloves and 
went to work. If another German would see 
it I would be killed on the spot. 
 
 Anthony: 
Was this a soldier or SS? 
 

164 Lillian:
 A soldier, not SS. A few da ys later he
 passed by and he was 
pretending like he 
dropped some thing like he would throw a bag with garbage towards my s i de. Then he passed 

away already and I picked up the bag. I saw that
 it was ma ybe one bite of a piece of br ead and 
one bite ma ybe of a cucumber or some thing like 
that. Instead of throwing it in the garbage, he 
threw it in my direction that I could have it. 
Even that one bite was worth more than a million 
dollars. We  had no food so th
at one bite had to be 
enough for I don't know how long. 
 

 Anthony: 
He could tell that you were quite skinny, hungry? 
 

176 Lillian:
 Terribly hungry. We  were ea
ting potato peels, whatever we could get hold of. After a 
few weeks, the same  German soldier, as he 
was dropping the bag with the garbage that I'm 
sure he wouldn't eat this, that instead of 
throwing it in the garbag
e he threw it under my 
machine. He  told me  that he has a daughter back home , and I remi nd hi m of her. His daughter 

must look like I do now, the same  age probably,and looked like me . A short time  later, we 

find out that he was sent to the 
front lines because he 
was too friendly. Because I started to cry 
what happened I don't see him anymore. And that's what the me n that were working in the 

office, cleaning the offices whatever, they told us
 that the SS ma n they saw that he was talking 
to me  and to others probably too and he heard th
e gossip that they sent him straight to the front 
lines because  of his friendship with the workers and I never sa w him again.  
 

196 
I was tryi ng to do some thing to spoi l the bullets
 that they wouldn't be able to use it, the 

Germans. And once as they were comi ng out fr
om the machi ne after being checked if they 

could or not and we could tell when they were
 not the right size, what
ever, that they'r e not 
good that we  shouldn't okay that bushel of bullets. They were comi ng into the machine in 

bushels and packed. And I was pretending I didn'
t see it. They were all ruined. Quite a few 
bushels went through. I okayed them, that they 
are okay, pretending that I don't know that they 

are spoiled. And that was my satis
faction that I let through bad ones 
that they wouldn't  be able 
to use them to fight. 
 

 Anthony: 
These were bullets that  
had less gunpowder in them?  
 

200 Lillian:
 The weight of it wasn't  right so that mean
s they wouldn't  explode or some thing. That's 
what we were told by the underground. 
The gossip was going around, if we could do 
some thing to do it. Then one day, the gossip comes the Russians are not far behind. That they 

heard that the camps would be evacuated again. 
 

 Anthony: 
Do you remember when this was? 
 

27
 Lillian:
 No. No calendar, no dates. 
 

 Anthony:
 Summer, winter? 
 

 Lillian:
 Not very cold. It must have been fall. And we were sent to another city, Czestochowa 
where they were also doing the same
 thing, just another part of Poland. 
 

 Anthony:
 In the south. 
 

 Lillian:
 Away from the Russian border, more to the south. 

 

 Anthony: 
Another mu nitions factory. 
 

 Lillian:
 Yeah. 

 

 Anthony: 
You're still with that girl. Reme mber you were with the gi rl in that pipe?  We re you 
still together at this point? 
 

225 Lillian:
 No. She went one way, I went another. I 
don't know what happened to her. I saw the 
people that are going as a group being sent some
place and I forget. There is no other way of 

surviving, of escaping anyhow, if I'll die here or if
 I'll die in the cattle tr
ain or if I'll die in 
another pl ace wherever they send us is just  th
e same . I 'll take my chan
ces of going with that 
group. And that's how I went. 
 

 Anthony: 
But I mean did you separate at the rifle munitions factory? 
 
 Lillian:
 No, No before. I didn't see her with my transport. 
 

 Anthony: 
So she didn't go with your transport? 
 

233 Lillian:
 No, but I know that she went some  other place. She wa sn't  killed. Now we are in 
Czestachowa, in that other ammunition factory. 
The work was more or less the same , working 
around the clock. Food, very little. So me times in 
the garbage you could find a cigarette that a 
German was throwing away and that one drop co
uld go among five, six or seven to take one 
puff. That was a substitute for food. 
 

 Anthony: 
Otherwise you had never smoked be fore. 
 

243 Lillian:
 No. You had to be one of the very luck
y ones if you could share one cigarette among 
five or six or ten people. One puff. That 
had to satisfy your hunger. Many times when 
some body died overnight, we were keeping him 
on the bunk bed on the bridge for another day 

or two till the body started smelling already so we
 could get an extra portion of soup or bread 
for him, pretending that she's alive and we™re ta
king that portion for all of us, or taking her 
name  that we'r e taking that portion. That's how
 we changed name s by the hour, by the day just 
to get an extra slice of bread or some thing so you 
could stay in the line, le
t's say twice, if they 
didn't recognize you. Once as yourself; the next tim
e as the person that was dead. But we were 
sharing it among ourselves. But usually there we re
 groups of five, six, and whatever extra food 

we could get, one was helping the other.  
 

28
259 
And it became  already standard like if some
body dies, till the Germans come  and s mel l it 
already miles away and know that some body is dea
d, that body was lying there, and we had an 
extra slice of bread for it. We  were worki
ng there under conditions -- they are not human, 
because even a dog you don't treat that way. I don't know how you could ever survive to get 
that far, if it was luck or if
 it was me ant to be. I know that
 among ourselves we were always 
talking that probably we are th
e only ones that survived that 
it's impossible that there is 
some body else, another group or another factory or
 another place of Je
ws that survived.  
 

277 
That we mu st be the only ones and the lucky ones 
so in a way we have to survive to tell what 
happened, where is the rest. And that's  what ke
pt us going. When we heard the rumors again 
that the Russians are in back comi ng very fa
st towards our direction. The Germans surrounded 
all the people from the factory, 
the workers, me n and wome n and started a ma rch towards the 
woods. Later, quite a while later, we found out th
at most of them were killed in the woods, 
they didn't even get to the railroad. I was working 
in that last stage of packing the bullets, so I 
was left to the last mi nute to put everything 
in boxes that's  supposed to be transferred to 
another place or to the front, we didn't  know
 whe r e. That was just a few hundred people. 
Those that were packing the boxes, packing th
e documents, packing the 
bullets in the boxes. 
All of a sudden it was night, a 
night shift. And we'r e looki
ng around we want to ask for 
some thing, what to do or where to put it away
 and we see there are less and less Germans 

around.  
 

296 
Finally, we don't see any of them and we don't 
know where to go and look for them a nd we 
look at each other. What's goi
ng on?  No Ger mans. We  look into
 the office, no Germans . What 
happened?  That night the Russians 
were really comi ng. The y were 
so close, all the Germans as 
fast as they could they escaped and they left 
that handful of people to pack the bullets. They 
couldn't do nothing to them. They di dn't have the 
time to destroy them or destroy the factory 
so they ran away, changing into civilian clothes.
 When we were looking 
what to do next when 
we finished with our work, we realized th
at nobody's around. And we start walking. We would 
take advantage of it. Nobody's around. We  walk st
raight to the gate a
nd we see fire. Again 
they put the places, the living quarters and part 
of the factory on fire. We  couldn't go back and 
we couldn't get out. Out was where the train was,
 the railroad where th
ey were packing the 
bullets. We couldn't get to the 
trains because they put everyt
hing on fire when they escaped. 
And we couldn't get back to our barracks becau
se  on the other side that was fire and we'r e 
standing in the mi ddle. 
 

 Anthony: 
With gunfir e, with bullets. 
 

318 Lillian:
 With nothing. The bullets are in the boxes. What can we do?  We didn't have the rifles. 
We couldn't do nothing. Just a bullet 
without the rifle you can do nothing. 
 

 Anthony: 
You realized that the flames if they r
eached the bullets that everythi ng would go 
up. 
 

322 Lillian:
 That's  the end of us, yeah. And a very large group of people ma rched out already of 
the camps. They were taking them into the woods, we didn't know where. The Germans were 

telling us that they'r e taking them to another pl
ace of work. But later on 
we found out that they 
were killed on the way to the railroad station. And we see nobody' s around, no Germans, so 

we start walking. Some body said that they broke 
a little opening not a gate but it was a fence. 
The place wa s fenced in and there is an openi
ng so meplace that we could get out not to be 

29
burned alive. We 'r e all pushing toward that ope
ning and we start walking. We walk and walk 
and walk and then we see one of the buildings 
that must have been occupied by Germans. We  
walk in, dark, no light, no electricity. Inst
ead of going up, I don't know how we wound up 
going down to a baseme nt.  
 
340 
We walk into that basement terribly hungry a
nd thirsty and there's absolutely nothing to eat 

and nothing to drink. One starts screaming she 
found a bottle and there's some liquid in it, 
some  fluid. Probably it was a 
basement where the Germans had like a wine cellar. The 
Germans we re hiding wine there. We  were so 
terribly thirsty. That was one of the German 
tricks. They gave us sometimes salty food without
 water. So we started taking each one a sip 
from that bottle, whatever it is, as long as it'
s some fluid to drink. And of c ourse we were 
drunk, sick. Half of us was left dead. They died
 actually from the liquor or whatever they 
could get hold of. Then we found honey. So we 
had a little of that honey. I think we were 
standing there for two days in th
at baseme nt. A 
group of wome n. 
 
Anthony: 
Do you reme mber when this was? 
 

Lillian:
 In ™45. 

 

Anthony: 
Do you reme mber the mo nth? 
 

 Lillian:
 Beginning, January. 

 

 Anthony: 
January, still winter. 
 

360 Lillian:
 Still winter. After two days 
it's very quiet. We  don't  hear 
anymore. The fire probably 
was out because we looked out. It was early 
in the morning. How long can we stay here?  
There were a few dead already in the cellar 
from drinkingand eati
ng that honey, whatever?  
How long are we going to stay there in that
 cellar?  And as we'r e comi ng out some body 
approached us from the underground, a Pole, ge
ntile. And he said he's  from the underground, 
go back, stay there for another few hours till I'
ll tell you it's safe to come out and he was 
telling us that the Russ
ians liberated the area and they'r e he
re already. We 're actually free but 
that it's not very safe to be in 
the area, the bullets are still flyi
ng. He'll come back and he'll tell 
us when it's safe to come  out. I think it was th
e following day that he came  and he said now it's 
safe that you can come  out from that baseme nt and he brought us some  bread and water and I 

reme mber I asked him, he was a young fellow,
 "What day is it? "  It was January 18.  
 

382 
It was the same  day two years la
ter that I lost my mother. I lo
st my mother January 18. My 
mother was shot in 1943. January 18, 45, approxi
ma tely the same  ti me  I was liberated. What 
came to my mi nd right away like my  mother gave he
r life so I can live and survive. Probably it 
was a coincidence that the same time the sa
me day two years late
r I was liberated. 
 

 Anthony: 
You realized it that day? 
 

 Lillian:
 Yeah. And I asked what day is it? He said 
January 18. So we mus t  have been liberated 
the seventeenth. I don't know. Who k
nows the time  when we  were st
anding there in that cellar. 
But that was the time  I was liberated, January 
18, when my mother was killed trying to go to 

the other side, to the big ghetto. Now if you think 
that the liberation was a picnic for us, that 
starts anot her story with the Poles. 

30
 
 Anthony: 
This was an underground ma n, a Polish. Do you recall which army he was in? 
 

401 Lillian:
 No, civilian clothes. No army. He was ju
st probably a nice human
 being that brought 
us bread and water and whoever came  out survive
d. And he said go into the city. In the city 
were a lot of Germans living wherever you find an empty apartment or an empty place go in 

and stay there. Don't wal k around in the streets 
it's not very safe. Whatever place you find after 
a German, you can stay there and live there for 
a while. The Russian army will come into the 
city; they'll take care of you. We
 came into the city and as we'r e walking, we'r e trying to get 
water and that's where we met the Polish people
 and each one of them said the same . So ma ny 
of us still alive?  We  thought you were all ki ll
ed. Who needs you?  What for so ma ny. Like we 
should go back and be killed.  
 

422 
That was our welcome after all that hell that 
we went through. We  found an apartme nt in 
Czestochowa where that factory was. There 
was no food. We  went out to look for food. We  
couldn't find nothing. We found one bakery. They 
were baking bread. We took hot bread that 
they gave us, the bakers. Some  
started eating right away that hot
 bread and they got sick from 
it. Many of them died. I never liked hot bread. 
I didn't eat it. As you saw me , I ma de hot the 
bagels for you people, I didn't eat
 it. Maybe that was a mi racle th
at I survive. If I would take 
that hot bread ma ybe I would die 
because a lot of the girls died from the hot bread, too. Their 
stomachs couldn't accept or whatever it was they got sick from. So I took that br ead ho me, ate 

later, and I was okay. 
 

 Anthony:
 Cold bread. 
 

441 Lillian:
 Cold, not hot. The Russians gave us li
ke coupons that we'r e supposed to come  
everyday and get food from the army . But they were
 not a bowl of cherries to swallow. They 
felt that  each one that they liber
ated they owned that woma n. A
nd that woma n or that girl was 
supposed to be their slave or go 
to bed with them. As a ma tter of fact, they raped one of the 
girls and she hanged herself. She couldn't accept the fact that after what she went through a 

Russian soldier will rape
 her and then what. 
 

 Anthony: 
This was the liberation. 
 

 Lillian:
 That was the liberation. So we were not t
oo long in that city, Czestochowa. That's  
supposed to be a holy city, they call it. 
 
Anthony
: The Madonna. 
 

Lillian:
 Right. 

 

Anthony: 
Yes, the Black Madonna. 
 

Lillian:
 So you know the story. 

 

Anthony: 
Yes, the savior of Poland. 
 

460 Lillian:
 Right. That was ma ybe the 
savior of Poland but not the 
savior of the Jews. And not 
the savior of huma nity either. The me mories 
were too bad and we couldn't stay there any 

31
longer. Besides, there was no food. We couldn't tu
rn to the Russians. They wouldn't give us 
nothing. Wh ere we heard on the Ame r ican side or
 on the English side they fed the survivors 
like human beings. Here, the Russians felt that we
 are their slaves and we'r e supposed to in 
return sleep with each one of them. 
 
 Anthony: 
So what are you going to do? 
 

471 Lillian:
 We  went to another city. We  couldn't go 
back to Wa rsaw. There was no Wa rsaw left. 
Not even enough to stay overnight. Everythi
ng was in ruins so we went to Lodz, 
Litzma nnstadt that's in German. That was a bigge
r city and more places to stay and some how 
the Jewish population from all around from the 
smaller places came  into the big cities. They 
felt more security or mo re friendly people. We  lik
ed it better. So we stayed in the big city and 
the rumors were that we found out later that was 
true that the Poles were
 killing the Jews after 
the liberation just like the Germ
ans were killing them during th
e war, the pogroms. It was one 
big one Rado m and Kielce, all the smaller cities, even in the big cities. Poles it was the Armi a 

Krajowa. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, the Home Ar my. 
 

Lillian:
 The Home  Ar my. You understand Polish already? 

 

Anthony: 
AK 
 

495 Lillian:
 AK and they were the biggest anti-Semites. 
So they were killing. Again how long can 
you stay there?  Is that what I survived for 
to be killed now by my so-called friends?  I'm 
supposed to be a Polish citizen. I am a Polish ci
tizen. My father was an officer in the army, 
and again now they'r e going to kill me . Why?  Ju
st because I am a Jew. Nobody could even tell 
us apart, the Jew and the non-Jew. We were goi
ng to school together, 
playing together, living 
together next to each other. Why are they ki
lling us?  Some  couldn't even say why. Like when 
we asked why are you hitting us?  They were 
coming in the mi ddle of the night into the 
apartments where they knew that a group of Jewi
sh people lived and kil
ling them one after the 
other. Why are you doing it?  Because you ar
e a Jew. That's enough to be killed.  
 

515
 At that time, I met some body duri
ng my staying in the factory th
at we got very friendly and 
we were so-called couple. You couldn't call it 
a marriage because there 
wasn't  a marriage like 
you see today, you go the Justice of the Peace an
d you sign up it's a marriage. There was no 
rabbi or priest or anybody to ma rry you. 
 

 Anthony: 
So you had a boyfriend in the factory? 
 

 Lillian:
 Yeah, so whoever knew how to say it, wh
atever, that™s how they pronounced them 
husband and wife. 
 

 Anthony: 
And when did you tie th
e knot so to speak? 
 

530 Lillian:
 Right after the war. All we were thinki ng of 
is that we are so terr ibly lonely. We 'r e all 
alone, no family, that we have to start another fam
ily just not to be all alone. The couples were 
not even couples that had some thing in common. 
It was just couples not
 to be alone, not to 
wait for that knock on the door that the Russians would come  and rape you, or the Poles will 

32
come  and kill you. As long as you're more than one, you're safer. So that's how ma rriages 
started. 
 

 Anthony: 
To not be alone in the world. 
 

Lillian:
 Not to be all alone. 

 

Anthony: 
When did you first meet this boyfriend? 
 

Lillian:
 In the camps.  

 

Anthony: 
Which camp? 
 

Lillian:
 That was before we even got into the camps. 

 

Anthony: 
In Warsaw? 
 

Lillian:
 Yeah. 

 

Anthony
: From the ghetto then? 
 

Lillian:
 Yeah, and here and there we we
re meeting and we got together. 
 

Anthony
: And he was Jewish? 
 

Lillian:
 Yeah, of course. 
 
Anthony
: So there you are 1945, married. 
 

532 Lillian:
 Married, and of course the fi
rst thing that came to his mi nd is start a new fa mily. I was 
against it. I was still 
afraid of the killing and the shoo
ting and the pogroms what was going on. 
When I found out I'm pregnant there were two wa
ys. I leave Poland imme di
ately or I get rid of 
the pregnancy. But I wouldn't give birth where my whole family perished, and where the 

grounds are soaked with Jewish blood. And that's
 where I start a new lif
e now. And that's  how 
we left Poland and wound up in Italy wh
ere I gave birth to my first child. 
 
Anthony
: So your child was born 
an Italian citizen? 
 

Lillian:
 Yeah. 

 

Anthony
: Male or female? 
 

Lillian:
 Fema le.  

 

Anthony
: And her name? 
 
Tape II, Side B 
 

571 Lillian:
 I name d her Isabella. It's an Italian name
. When we came to the United States, they 

33
were calling her Isa and from Isa came Liz because
 Isa is not an American name, and from Liz 
we changed officially the name  to Liz as 
Elizabeth and that's  how she wound up to be 
Elizabeth because everybody was calling he r already Liz. 
 
[Tape II, Side B is blank from here onward] 
 
 Anthony
: Elizabeth, born in Italy in December 1945. 
 
 Lillian:  
December 22. 
 

 Anthony
: So you didn't waste much time? 
 

 Lillian:
 No. We  didn't believe it that we can star
t even a new fa mily. It was one of the 
mi racles that happened. After what we went
 through, no food, and the circumstances we'r e 
surviving. It was really a mi racle 
how we could create a new fa mily. 
 

 Anthony
: So your fa mily, your entire fa mily was Elizabeth and your husband, and his name ?  
 

 Lillian:
 Edward. 

 

 Anthony
: And how did you get to America? 
 

 Lillian:
 I wa s thinking at that time of going to Israel but I was torn away
 from the group three 
times. Once it was in my eighth month. They said 
that it's too dangerous for me  to go. I should 
wait till the baby is born. When the baby is bor
n, maybe I'll get legal papers and go with the 
baby. I was waiting when the baby was born. When
 the baby was six weeks old, I came  the 
second time  to go to Israel. They said the baby 
is too small. They don't have room for small 
babies. I should wait till the baby is older. How 
long am I supposed to wait now?  At least till 
the baby is three months old. I was waiting. Wh en
 the baby was three months old, I came the 
third time. They didn't have room for me. They 
don't want to take the risk of sending wome n 

and babies when there is no peaceful  time and they 
cannot give me legal papers to go to Israel. 
So I said if three times they'r e turning me back, 
that means that it's not me ant to be and I'm not 
going anymore. At that time  in one of those 
DP camps they were signing up people who want 
to go the United States. We signed up, and we said
 we want to go to the United States. In a 
few years later we came to the United States to 
a small town in Pennsylvania, Uniontown. It's  
not far from Pittsburgh. It's farther north. 
 
Anthony
: And it was much better than anything– 
 
Lillian:
 It was paradise. If there is 
a paradise, that was our paradise
. Li ke the saying if there is 
a Santa Claus and if there is a paradise afte
r the concentration camps. Italy was the small 
paradise and that was the big 
paradise. And here I had my second child. My marriage didn't 
work out. Like I said those were not ma rriages because we ha d some thing in common as a 

couple, just not to be alone, to
 have whoever you have just as l
ong as it's two, not one and start 
another family. That was the end of that ma rriage. But I always had in mi nd one thing. 

Knowledge is some thing that you never lose in 
your life and I have to ma ke sure what I 
couldn't reach, my children would. So I pushe
d them as muc h as I could. I actually 
brainwashed them. That without knowledge, wit
hout finishing they would be nobodies. And if 

you're a nobody, you cannot survive. So it was actually brainwash. And they knew that well 

34
Mommy said if we'r e not going to go to school 
what will happen to us?  We 'll be nobody. So 
we'll have to go to school, we'll have to finish
 and we have to study ev
en harder and go to 
college and so on. And they did go through colleg
e and they'r e professionals. I'm ver y proud 
of them. That's why I said I feel I made my c
ontribution to society. If 
my life is fulfilled, no. 
 

 Anthony
: You never got to be a district attorney. 
 

 Lillian:
 I don' t know what would 
become  of me, how
 my life would turn around. There are 
ma ny things that are mi ssing in life that would never be because under the circumstances, 

that's the best I could do. I couldn't go to sc
hool in the United States. The small town I was 

living in there was no night school; there was 
no day school for newcome r s. Beside, I had a 

baby in my arms. How can you leave a baby and 
go to school. You can't  go to school with a 
baby. You can't  without. So I don't know wh
at would become of me under normal 
circumstances. That's why I said my life is never fulfilled. In a way of thinking what I would 

do if I would be with my fa mily together how I would find out. But where my fa mily is 

concerned I suppose I'm lucky, having beautiful
 children, rema rrying and with a nice husband. 
We 'r e very happy together and I hope we'
ll stay happy for ma ny, many more years. 
 

 Anthony
: So do I. Do you have any further observa
tions or comments?  Now that you've gone 
to paradise and been through hell. Yo
u certainly can't forget the hell. 
 

 Lillian:
 I don't know how much I believe in it myse
lf. But that's what I taught my kids. Where 
there is a will there is 
a way. That feeling, that 
drive to survive and to 
tell, to tell what I saw 
and what I went through that nobody would beli
eve even was so strong. Maybe that's what 
ma de me  sur vive. That willpower to survive and 
to bring another family, to raise the fa mily, to 
make my children be somebodys, to reach the 
point that I couldn't. Again, there is the 
willpower. Maybe if we would try ha rder for 
some thing else ma ybe we could accomplish too. 

I don't know. All I know I was tryi ng my best, and that's what I accomplished. 
 

 Anthony
: You did quite a bit. 
 

 Lillian:
 I hope so. 

 

 Anthony
: Thank you. Do you have anything else to add? 
 

 Lillian:
 I guess I do. I said I survived and I accomp
lished a lot. And you even agreed with me  
that I accomplished a lot. If I 
can call it an accomplishment for living, I don't know. Si nce I'm 

the only survivor of quite a large family. Like 
my mother's  ma iden name  is Szarnowska. The 
imme diate family that I'm saying imme diate is br
others and sisters and aunts and uncles. In the 
Szarnowska fa mily was 14. Nobody survived. My ma
iden name  is Guzenfiter. My father had 
three si st ers. They were married with childre
n. Twenty-eight people, that's the imme diate 
fa mily, brothers and sisters with their husba
nds and children, none of
 them survived. My 
mother's sister was ma rried. The name was Le
hman. They came  from a large family of 19 
children. Nobody survived. The whole family wa
s completely wiped out. My grandmother's 
maiden na me was Hershkowitz. Her brothers and 
sisters, the immediate family that we were 
always visiting each other, 18. Nobody survived. 
So that means of 109 people, I'm the only 
survivor. All those name s perished completely. 
They don't exist anymore. If you can call this 

living, with all those me mories, I 
don't know. I think I just exist.
 I was just asked how I spent 
the holidays. I said it was nice but sad. You can't  
help it. You'r e  always thinking of those that 

35
perished. How different it would be if you c
ould share some thing with them, any happiness. 
It's  not a happiness if you cannot share with
 some body. You cannot be happy all by yourself 
for accomplishing some thing for yourself. You have 
to share it with your 
dear ones, and they 
don't exist. Who is proud of you?  I can't be proud 
of myself. My mother, my grandparents, my 
aunts and uncles, cousins, there's nobody left, even
 for a holiday to sit 
at the table together 
except for the fa mily I created, my children th
at I'm very proud of, but it's not enough. That's 
all I want to add to it. 
 

 Anthony
: Thank you, Lillian.
