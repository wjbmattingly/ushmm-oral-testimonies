understand everythi ng. But I was afraid about future
 because they were afraid about future and 
after my Gra ndmother from Vienna came because she was alone, living there, and she hoped 
with our family she will be safe a little bit, and 
this I knew that it was not norma l and I, fi rst time 
I had a Grandmother, yes, and she told us that th
ings in Vienna were not very nice and for this

and not to cry and to go and to have a hope th
at it will not be so bad and that we were 
_________, this was our hope.

but we were pushed like sardines, pushed, as were
 ma ny people. And we arrived in Terezin very 
soon, early morning, and after we had to go to a very
 big hall for horses, I 
told it to you. And we 
were 500 in one room and we ha
d only one piece, we were lying on the earth, it was cold in

itants of Terezin, to 
Boholovitz-cat-lo-trina

they will put bombs to us and they will kill 
us, everybody. And it was near
ly dark, the whole day 
from morning, we were staying without food, without 
anythi ng and waiting, if they will kill us or 
what will be. And when we could return, I was so exhausted that they ha ve  to carry me home. 
And I was really, really ill fr om this. But it was, 
this exhausting and this al so, our souls were not

hard and so frozen, these airs, and we had to, wh

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426

"give, you pig, give me  your boots!", I gave it to

had to give everything, she ha
d to leave everything there.

lucky, she came, but she was very, very ill. 
Q: Wa s your mother nearby at that time?

erything we do, we did, we were dreaming 
together. For example, a friend of mi ne, she's 
living now in Vienna, and she wrote a diary, the 
film was done, about it, and we were many, many
 evenings sitting together and we were 
dreaming. I wanted to study music at the conserva

 study acting. And we 
were thinki ng endlessl y about how it will be ni
ce when we will be back ho me  and we will be 
together. 

Q: So you all talked about what would happen in the future?

didn't know, for example , when my fr iends went to ____________, I have some  letters from 

them, and they were writing me  _________ letter
s. And we didn't know if we will see each 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
23 
 
other. And one friend of mi ne was wr iting me
 and, oh, when I will sign, I will write to you a 
letter fr om this place where I will be, but when
 I will sign that  I am "Mil-ka" (ph), sincerel y 
yours, Mil-ka  (ph). I am in good place. But when 
I will si gn "I am your Milshka (ph) , it is a bad 
place. Such, we were thinking, but she never wrote me  and she never came back. 
Q: But you all thought that 
you would get through this? 
A: Yes, I don't know why I didn't get a paper 
that I have to go to ____________. I think that it 
was this, that everybody, every girl, nearly
 everybody that was born 1930 was sending to 
___________, but when we arrived to Terezin my mo
ther wrote me , wrote into the paper and 
said that I wa s born in 1931. In this time , I was 
very angry because I was in the, I was a girl, I 
wanted to be older, no, I'm not younger, but ma ybe it saved my life. I don't know, it may be. We  

stayed only four, from our room, to the end of
 the Terezin-schatz (ph). Everybody from us went 
to ____________. And we were, ma ybe, with these cha
nges, we were ma ybe about 150 or more, 
only four we stayed in Terezin until the end. 
But now, after 40 years, we found each other and 
we are living ten, alive, in America, in Vienna
, in Israel, in Czech Republic and in Germany.

ft, did a lot of people 
leave at that time?

 three days they were transported . . . 
End of Tape 1.

 Tape

Question: Okay. 
Answer: Yes, nearly, I reme mber that nearly ev
ery two or three days in one time there were 
transports to _____________ and also 
my sister went. I told you, 
and ma ny, ma ny of my friends. 
They wrote me  five letters and I have them 
and I copied it for museum in the ____________ and 
I will copy it also in the Holocaust Museum in
 Washington because they are, you can have the 
feeling, you can read what we felt in this time . 
That we were ve ry sad and that we liked each 
other and we were not sure that  we will see each other again. 

Q: How did you know they were, where they were going to? 

A: Oh, we didn't know. It was not sure, 
but some body told us that it was _______________, 

some body t old us after, they would say they we
re gassed rooms and they were killed. Some body 
came after, at the end of the war,
 a little earlier, they had told 
it to us, but we were not sure. 
Q: As time went on, did the security, the guards a
nd everything, did that b
ecome mor e strict or 
less st rict? 

A: I think that it was, in one time it was more st
rict. But when it was nearly end of war I went to 

the place where people in very bad health 
came to Terezin. I was waiting my friends, I was 
waiting my sister, I was waiting 
my brother, and I was stayin
g there hours and hours. And I 
never forget this unhappy people who had not strength 
to walk or had not stre
ngth to live and we 
were helping there and giving th
em some thing, what we have, a
nd we found, also, some  friends 
from us, or we talked to neighbors, "oh, your re
lative is here, please go 
and treat him" . But my 
sister  didn't come. We got only a letter that  she's a
live, that she's very ill, that she's in Bergen-
Belsen and after she went to _______________ and some
 English soldiers liberated her and an 
English doctor saved her life because she was ve
ry, very ill. And for ma ny, ma ny years, for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
25 
 
about 40 years, I didn't like to think about it because after war, when I came  home, I wanted to 
live normal. I didn't want to speak with ma ny 
people about what happened to us. Also, some  
people told us, "oh, why came you back, why didn't 
you stay there", and it was very painful. I 
didn't like for 40 years to think ve
ry deeply about it because every time , when I started to think 
and to talk about what happened to us and to my
 friends and to my rela
tives, I was really ill 
about it. I wa s so, trembling and I wanted to
 live norma l and to study norma l and to work good, 
but some thing stayed. For example, I was so happy 
to be able to study, that they allowed me  to 
study, that when I had students which didn't wor
k, I was nearly furious. I told them, " How you 
can dare not to work?  You don't know that pe
ople, children or young people, couldn't learn 
anything, that they were in con
centration camps " , and so on. And 
this was a very strong feeling 
for me  because I was, everyday telling, thank you that I can live a norma l life. And because I was 

every time  so excited that, in that way about 
it, when I was speaking with some body, I  wanted to, 
didn't want to speak too much about it and I didn'
t visit Terezin 40 years af
ter the war. And after 
the 40 years I found the strength and I went ther
e with my son and it was very good that I went 
because I saw a nearly normal village. In the 
home  where we were living, nobody wrote that we, 
that they were some time s almost starving childr
en and that this happened and this happened. 
And after, I told to me , oh, you cannot thinking in
 this way, you have to
 be quiet and only you 
can work for the future. That never will the sa
me thing will happen to childre n and to people. 
And for this reason I am working in Terezin, in it
's  archive, in Prague, and I'm working also in 
my town, Berno (ph), in th
e staff of Jewish society. 

Q: I want to go back a little. You were saying

transpor ts? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426

about our friends who didn't return, and write abou
t them, and about our life, some thing, and also 

the diary of Helga Kinski  (ph) where she's writte
n about life in our ch
ildren's home . And we 
would like that everybody can read these things, 
ma ybe it will, we will ha ve good conditions to 
bring to it. 

Q: So after you went out, where did you 
go?  Wh en you left the children's home? 
A: After I went with my parents into th
is military ___________, and I am
 not sure if it was 
Bergem-Bac h (ph) or Magdeburg, but I think that
 it was Magdeburg and we had a very small 
piece and we were living there. It was a r
oom divided and we had ma ybe , I don't know how 
ma ny meters, three me ters, and we were living th
ere. And once it happened that I was alone at 
home  and that I was cleaning the window, I wa
s staying in the window, and one ma n c a me . I 
thought it was an SS ma n, it was Mr. Mume lstein (
ph) and he came and he kick to the door and 
he was shouting a little bit on me  
and looking not in very good way 
of me and I was, I had some

 were very frightening to you? 
A: No, besides with this counting in this Bols
hevik (ph) ________ when we stayed there a whole 
day, it was very bad. And every transport was a ve
ry, very bad experience for us because we 
have to say fa rewell to people which were, who 
were for us very, very dear and we didn't know 
if we will see them and this was very hard. And we were afraid that  everyday we will, we were 
on the row and we will go. And we felt th
at it was not a good pl
ace where the SS go. 
Q: Did you ever see people being punished or beaten? 

A: I heard about it. I heard that some body, when 
some body wanted to fly, that they were hanging 
there and they were shooting, yes. But I didn'
t see it. I saw only when some body was shouting 
and so forth. 

Q: Toward the end were therea lot of sick people around? 

A: Yes. Also, when it was finishing we had also
 a big epidemic of typhus. And they took us 
children to one sanatorium outside of Terezi

treating us and giving us meal a
nd treating us from the me dic a l side. And my mother and father 
had to stay in Terezin and after we 
went back and after we went home. 
Q: This was after liberation? 

A: After liberation, yes. We we

om Terezin because it was an epidemic.

A: Yes, I reme mber. Because we had the SS, ________________, and he gave us to eat and we 

had to tell him, "________ __________, _________________", "again we have sardines", and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
28 
 
so it was like  for ___________, religious. And they built shops and café houses and in these 
shops we got also tickets that we can shop all 
money, we had also money, that we can buy there, 
but nothing was there, only I reme mber ___________ a
nd some  things like this, but we didn't, 
we couldn't buy because nothing was there. It was only like for this ______________, this 

villages. And when the Red Cross came, then we 
had to clean everything and they chose also 
children, they looked well, they didn't, they were
 not too slim, and it was 
like a theater, like a 
spectacle. And we got a piece of bread and we were
 eating and like this. In
 film you c a n also see 
it. 

Q: This mus t  have seemed strange to you? 

A: Yes, but we were happy to have a piece of bread! 

Q: So you acted for them?  

A: Yes, but we had to do it. 

Q: What else do you reme
mber about Terezin? 
A: I reme mb er only that I was ha
ppy that we could leave. I was 
happy that my brother came  to 
Terezin in the uniform of U.S. Ar my because when he flew from this, when they moved from the 
Malyy-Trostenetz concentration camp and when
 the war was ended, and he got, I don't know 
how, to the U.S. Ar my because he wa s speaking 
very well English, he was helping, and he came  
to, with the U.S. Ar my t o Czech country and then
 it was only possible, he  came to look if we are 
alive. And I was the first, I saw him. And I was so happy!  And after we got a letter from my 

sister, and it was also nice, and 
after we were looking forward to the time when we can leave. 
But the people who went, who ca me  back from 
ot her concentration camps were in such bad 
health that I never forget these people. How they
 came, because they were exhausted and I think 
after some  days they wouldn't want to be alive.

Q: I read that the people who 
lived in Terezin-stat were able
 to get food packages from around 
the world. Is that true?  Di d you have enough food? 
A: One time  it was possible, but we didn't have anybody to send us some t hing. 

Q: Maybe Jewish organizations, or? 

A: Nobody. I think it was so ma ny people that 
it was not possible. And these Jewish 
organizations, they are also dying. Only when
 some body was from, ma yb
e a Christian woma n 
and a Jewish father and children, ma ybe she, they
 were both in Prague or
 another town, and she 
could send some thing. It was some th
ing, possible, but also we got a 
letter from my sister, we got 
a letter to Terezin. But it was only a ca
rd, that she's alive. But nothing more. 
Q: Did you have radios? 

A: No, we had to give everything. And in this 
time , I think the small radios were not yet. 
Q: Did you have any knowledge about what wa
s going on with the war and the camps and all 
that? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. We  ha d to because people we
re speaking about it. I don't know how they could 
have it, but I can tell you that when we were 
liberated, we were inside when the guns were 
working, when we were liberated I, every ti
me  I was dreaming, how I was happy. How I will be 
jumping when the liberation will be. I can tell you 
that I was so exhausted that I couldn't feel the 
real happiness. After a long time, I could feel 
it. And my brother wrote a poem about it and it 
express also my feelings, also when we were in
 another pl ace. Because I cannot translate it to 
you. I am liberated with, it was asking, yes?  Ca
n I live as before?  It was too much. I went 

through so ma ny hard and difficult situations that it 
will take me a long time if I can be, I can feel 
that I am liberated, I am a human being, I can live 
norma l. It is inside me  and it is like a stone, 
yes?  And I could feel, I was a child, I was not ye
t 15, I was 14-years-old and I can tell you that I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
30 
 
couldn't be so happy. I was so exhausted from this waiting and waiting and seeing what 
happened. 

Q: At the time of liberation, and you were liberated by what army?  

A: By Russian army and English. The English we re 
a little less, but English soldiers were ther e. I 

can reme mb er it. 

Q: What happened? 

A: They came . First we were hidden. After, when 
it was, a little quiet we  came out and they were 
singing. We  were thanking them and after we were
 looking what to do. What to have to eat. 
What to, because after this we had 
to take care about ourselves alone. 
Q: So they didn't stay very long? 

A: Oh, they stayed. They stood, I think, the w
hole time. Because after I went towards the 
sanatorium, I cannot tell you everything becau
se I was one mo nths out from Terezin. 
Q: So you left very soon after the liberation? 
A: Yes. It was, I cannot tell, it was some  days, 
it was ma ybe 14 days after this liberation because 
it was this very dangerous typhus and it was not 
good, the children stay there, and after they had 
passed, and after, although my father organized his life after liberation, 
he took care about food 
and about helping people and also me di
cal care started. Beca
use it was necessary. 
Q: When you left for the sanitarium, were you at
 all scared about leavi
ng your parents at this 
point?  
A: A little bit, but we went with othe r children and it was fi rst time we can get out!  To a new 

life, to a ni ce nature, it was something like paradise! 

Q: How long did you stay, after you came back fro
m the sanitarium, how long did you stay at 
Terezin before you left? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
31 
 
A: Not too long, I think about in June, ma ybe also 
14 days or so. I know that in June we got, we 
came back to our town, to Berno (ph), and we had 
to start a new life. It was not so easy because 
we didn't have money. Our fate was not free, an
d we got only 500 crowns and from U.S. Ar my, 
___________________ said, oh, we could go some where to 
eat some thing, but we couldn't eat 
because our stomachs were not use to eat too much
 and we had some  difficulties. Now I started 
to look, what shall I study?  And I forgot nearly
 everything from my knowi
ng to play piano and I 
wanted to go to conservatory and I was looking 
for it to work very hard to again do exam. It 
lasted one year. I had to do exams from the nor
mal school because I didn't have schools, yes?  
And I can tell you that in Ter
ezin, we had so good professors. 
I had good ma rks, only I studied 
only ma thematics, ma th. And I got through. The life 
was hard, but I was so drinking the life that 
I was attending, for example, cinema . At four o'cl
ock, six o'clock and eight o'clock!  But I didn't 
know what it was because there were three films,
 but I had to live. I wanted to live and funny 
things I did, such un-norma l things. 
Q: Did your fa mily have any question about going back to the Czech Republic? 
A: My fa mily had to go because my parents were 
a little bit older and not 
healthy. My father was 
without his right hand and we tried 
to start this normal 
life. But my brother left for America, he 
couldn't study more, he had ___________ before war, 
before concentration camp and he couldn't 
leave and he went for America when it was possibl
e. And my sister, sec
ond sister was living in 
Israel and my second sister, this dancer, she was so ill after the war, she had tuberculosis, she 

was in sanatorium. We  c ouldn't leave it. I wanted
 to go to Israel but I 
couldn't do it because my 
parents were alone and they are not so strong an
d my sister wa s so ill. I started to study 
_____________ and stayed here. 

Q: Now whe n you went back to Bruno (ph)
, you said some body else was in your flat? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
32 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you try to get it back? 

A: We  tried, but we found one floor near, lowe
r. We found a flat, it was empty because they 
were Germa ns. And we could go there. We  c
ould find our piano after ma ny months. And we 

could live in this flat, but we had to pay, furnitu
re, not too mu ch, but it was so hard for us. My 
father had to borrow mo ney from bank and had to 
start to a new life and he
 started to work and 
to build his shop again. But, when he gave back 
this money, it was three y
ears, it lasted three 
years. And when he gave back, after we started to
 live a little bit normal, Communists came to us 
and he had to close his shop. And it was ve
ry hard for him. But we had to live. 
Q: What about your former nei
ghbors?  How did they treat you when you came back?  Were they 
happy to see you? 

A: Some body was happy, some body was 
not happy. I told you that some  also, one mother of my 
school ma te, she told me , "why did you return? W
hy didn't you stay there? "  And, "this was not 
norma l girl", and "everybody was laughing about he
r", and before war, I was the one, I was 
every time  telling, "why you are la
ughing?  She cannot, she is a poor 
girl", and as to things we 
had hidden by our neighbors, nearly everybody told
 us that they had bombs and they have 
nothing more. And we got only one small thing, 
one small statue from the house from my 

mother, it wa s reme mbe r ing her house, and she 
was happy. But we didn't care about what we 
have because it was not the important thing. The im
portant thing was that we were free, that we 
could live, we could work, and I 
could study. And we could take a l
ittle care about, to improve 
our health. 

Q: How i mp ortant was religion to 
you, during Terezin 
and afterwards? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
33 
 
A: I can tell you that I lost my religion in Te
rezin because I was praying for my friends and 
nothing happened. And I was quarreling with the 
God. And a s king Him, " why he is so cruel and 
he let these things to work?"  No, He didn't answ
er me . For this reason, I only was feeling that I 
am a me mbe r  of a group of people that had th
e same  destiny, and I was proud of this big 
tradition, this old tradi
tion. I was proud that I was a Jewi
sh and I told everybody that I am 
Jewish, but I didn't practice the religion. After, 
when my father died, I came a little bit back. 

Q: Did you ever resent being Jewish? 

A: What is this, resent? 

Q: Resent would be, were you ever
 angry that you were Jewish? 

A: No, no, never. I only was doing things to tel
ling people that never it can come  again, and to 

__________. 

Q: What kept you strong? 

A: I think it was a school of life, what got us 
through. And when we coul
d live like this, we had 
to be strong. And we learned to live in bad condi
tions and try to be happy with small things. We , 
I think that it was a, so good 
school that, also, after the war, 
the life was not every time so easy. 
That we coul d go through a little bit lighter than
 ot her people. Because we had harder time s. 
[end of side one of Tape 2.] 

Q: You were saying that, for those of you who su
rvived camp s, life afterwards, you handled it 
differently than other people? 

A: Yes. We had a strong will. We wanted to 
leave and we were working ve ry hard and we 
wanted to, what we couldn't do in the concentrat
ion camp, we wanted to do everything better and 
we were very, very, very hard working. Because
 it was not so easy for us who didn't have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
34 
 
schools, although when we read something, but it 
was not everything. And we had to run, to run 
very quickly to do everything in time . 
Q: You valued life more? 

A: Yes, yes, everything. Everythi
ng was nice for us and for everythi
ng to be thanked in our soul. 
Q: When you think about how your 
life has developed for the last 
fifty years, can you talk about 
the impact that those early years had on the choices you ma de ? 

A: Now, I don't understand. 

Q: I'm asking if, these early experiences had to
 have effected the way you've lived you'r e life 
later. You started to talk about 
that, are there other things in terms of a choice you ma de or the 
way you raised you're son, or? 

A: Yes, yes. I think we were, 
we developed our personality in 
another wa y if, when or if we 
lived a normal way. And everything was, ever
y time I was comparing. Yes. Also, with my 

students, I told you that I was ve
ry strong and very serious. They had to work hard and they 
needed to be honest and to be helpful and to be
 deeper, to be deep. No
t only to do it, everything 
so. I think I was also, not only a 
professor of mus i c, but I was like a mother or aunt, and I think 
that they were also, they work and they laugh fo
r this, what they did. Th
ey were a little bit 
deeper. It wa s some body or couldn't be deep, but mostly they were. 

Q: When you were talking about that poem, that 
liberation, you said there was a line, like, "Can 
we live as be fore?" 

A: Yes. It was the fi rst time, we were living a lit
tle bit in the past, and we
 were trying not to live. 
It was also, it needed to have strength. And 
not to feel that our body was weak and we had 
diffi culties. We  wanted to work as nothing happened and we wanted to forget. And it, the cost  

was of, ma ny great strength and a great fear. Bu
t we did it. I could study, I had a degree. I did, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
35 
 
twice, conservatory. Not only once, I did as a pian
ist, after as a singer. After I did High School 
and I think I reached everything what a norma
l, grown, talented huma n being could reach. 
Q: Do you think you were robbed 
of your childhood in any way? 
A: Yes, but it had to be and I th
ink that, I was richer in this wa y, 
that I could have after. I could, 
everything, for everything be thankful and I was, 
I cannot say it, I could ha
ve a real friendship, a 
deep friendship, and everything what I had, it was 
a little bit, it was ev
erything more truthful. 
Q: One more question. When you think back, as I'm sure you do? 
A: Some times, yes. 

Q: Are there certain images that come back to you? 

A: Yes, yes. They are, and also when we meettogether with my friends who ca me  back, we were 

speaking about our life in concentration camp, bu
t we don't like to speak about the bad things. 
We were only speaking, not only some ti me s, al
so, but we were, we are speaking about good 
things, what we did, about the lif
e there, about helping each othe
r, about friendship, about these 
girls who didn't come  back and what we can do th
at they are not so forgotten. We will do that, 
we will bring the book, we will write about it. I 
think ma ny books are now here. The museum is 
full of new books. I was there. But, I think that so
me body who will read it, it is our duty to write 
it. 

Q: Is there one image that haunts you? 

A: Yes. I think. And the other image s that, I ha
ve to do some thing that nothing will come  back, 
that these bad things, they will 
never come  back. And also I can 
tell you, everythi ng what I did, I 
was doing, I tried to do good and well because I 
was a me mber of a nation who was, I cannot 
tell, haunted, yes?  And that ma ny 
gospels were about us and I want
ed to show that I am a nor ma l  
huma n being. That I can do good work, that I am 
a good, I was trying to me  to be good, to do the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0426  
36 
 
right things. That nobody can say, "Oh, look, this 
is a Jew and Jews are bad people". And I was 
not workingfor me , my _________ and 
everything what I did, I did in, as I am delegate of all 
Jews. 
Q: Do you have a sense of security today? 

A: A little bit, but not every time . Be cause th
ings in the world are, not every time, good and 
right. 

Q: Is there anything el
se you want to say? 
A: No. Only I can say that I was visiting here in 
this museum that's, I can tell thank you for it. It  
is good, very good done. It is simple, it is human, it is
 not show. Every soul who is able to feel, I 
think that everybody can have an impression of 
what happened and that
 I wish that everybody 
who is through to see it, that 
will be in his life a good person 
and say, don't alive these persons, 
allow, that  don't allow these things to be repeat ed. 

Q: Thank you.
