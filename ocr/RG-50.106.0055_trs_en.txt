A: November 6, 1924. 
 
Q: And where were you born? 
 
A: In Lodz. 
 
Q: And where is Lodz? 
 
A: Poland. 
 
Q: Is that where you grew up? 
 
A: Yes. Until I was ab out 15, we was going to
 German camp, since 
we lived in a better 
part of the city, they thre
w us out from the apartment. 
 
Q: Before we get to your experiences, when  the Germans came, can you tell me a little 
bit about what it was like to
 grow up in  Lodz? Was it  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Tell me about, let's sa
y, the Jewish community .  
 
A: It was a large Jewish community. It was a 
textile industry, and  and for foreign too for 
the ________ city. There was 
work in Lodz, because it 
was an industrial city.  
 
 
Q: Was it a large Jewish community in Lodz? 
 
A: Yes, yes. Oh, oh, oh, we were all Jews
. Maybe ______ were Ge
ntiles, and maybe it's 
in the outskirts, but since it was a textile c
ity, which was complete 
English, and, oh, and 
German. There were German also there. Th
ere was a large German community, because 
they came to  I think they were invited to Po
land to  start the textile industry. I think so .  
They  were, they were financially very we
ll off. They had their own school, but they 
spoke German at home. 
 
Q: What did your fami
ly do for a living? 
 
A: My father was a textile man of experi
ence, and we were from Poland, we were 
financially pretty good off.  My father died
, and he was very he
avy insured, so my 

mother received a lot of money from the insura
nce. And since we live
d in a good part of 
the city, when the gentleman came
, they threw us out right away. 
 
Q: When did your father pass away? 
 
A: In '34 I think. Because I 
was very young. Yes, in '34. 
That's the best I can tell you. 
 
Q: And what happened? Ho w did he die? 
 
A: When he died, he was very heavy insu re
d ,  so  my  mo th er and  
her sister, a lot of 
money. Bu t since we lived in 
a good part of the city, the 
gentleman threw us out right 
away from out of 
our apartment. 
 
Q: Again, can we just take a moment to find 
out a little bit more about life before the war.  
Did you have any brot
hers and sisters? 
 
A: Yes, I had two brothers. We all survived  
the Ho locaust, all three of us. On e brother 
was serving in the military, and he was taken 
prisoner by the Russian
s. He fought on the 
eastern front. He fought, but th ey let him go 
somehow. And he spen t  since he didn't 
know the language, so he wo rked  in the co
al mines. But later, when he learned the 
language, he wasn 't ____ so meplace down ther
e in Russia. Oh, he went  when  the 
Germans started, when the Germans came to
 Russia, he went, was it the Russian Army, 
different Russia, and he spent most  since he
 didn't  know Russian, so
 he had to work  in 
coal mines. For foreign, we were financially
 well off. When my father died, he was heavy 
insured, so he left my
 mother, the sister a lo
t of money. So later, she bought property in 
Poland, an apartment house. 
 
Q: Where did you go to school? 
 
A: I went to Hebrew school. It was acro
ss th e street where we live, started with 
convenient. And I finished grammar school. An
d later, I went to high school. And after, 
after the war, after, since I was lib erated in Po
land, somehow I  when 
they  when we were 
liberated, I still went to formal sch ool, but it 
was  there was not many, many Jews left in 
Poland, so, so.  
 
Q: What did you study in school? You said y
ou went to a Hebrew sc
hool. Wh at subjects 
did you learn? 
 
A: Oh, the regular, Hebrew. It was Polish hist
ory and the regular, regular subject. But I 
think I was only 12 years old wh en  when th
e war started. They threw us out from our 
apartment.  So we  we had no 
place to live. I had the _____ do
wn there, so first we went 
to the _____, but they
 were, it was crowded. So my  mo th er decided, since we have 
property in another city, we go
 to the city down there, a
nd we somehow will survive, and 
we get an apartment down there. 
 

Q: Before you leave Lodz and tell me what 
happened after you left Lodz, wh ile you were 
growing up before the war, was 
there any antiSemitism in Lodz? 
 
A: It was  we didn't feel it, because it wa
s a heavy populated Jewish city, and we  the 
servants were all Gentile. The rest, the tex
tile industry, was comple
tely in Jewish hand 
and in German hands. I think German. When
 Poland was beaten, 
then the German came 
out with  with flags, 
with swastikas to gree
t the oncoming Germans.
 
Q: Can you tell me about the German invasi
on? What were your first sights when  the 
Germans came? What did you see? 
 
A: Well, we were thrown out from the 
apartment very, very soon. And the men 
couldn't  couldn't  go out on the streets, becau
se they were taken to
  they was to force 
slave.  ______, right away, they  didn't have  
they didn't  have really
 work, so they make 
them sweep the street and all this, the whol
e dirty work. And so 
we didn't  live l o ng, 
because they threw us 
out from the apartment. 
 
Q: Who threw you out? 
 
A: German, the Germans. They came in, came in, look over, si nce it was in a better part 
of the city. I think this was 
the acting Germans, what was 
left in the city. There was 
[Coughing]. Excu se me. There was grandfather clock, and it was  my mo ther took it out 
for cleaning, and the German came and saw that 
the inside is taken off, he got angry, and 
he kicked my brother down the stairs. I wasn
't home at that time. 
I think I was still going 
to school. This was very early in the war. 
 
Q: So you said that very early on, after the 
German invasion, you were kicked out of your 
apartment.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then  you went to anot
her town , and you went to  
 
A: I think to, we had the aunt, that my moth
er's sister [coughing]
. I think we rented a 
place, just a room, in another 
Jewish home. We lived very cr
owded. And later, they  they 
took over my aunt, the si
ster of my mother, they
 took over the business.  
 
It was so  so we lived together in one room
. My mo ther had property
 in Czestochowa, so 
she thought that she will get an
 apartment there that we could live like human being. It 
take  took us a long time until we got there. 
Well, when we traveled, we traveled by bus. 
When the bus couldn 't make
 the hill, they said you 
[]
Nrouse, and we had to push the bus 
up th e hill. It took us a long  maybe a half
 a year, maybe more, until we came to that 
CzestochowA: 
 
Q: How did you manage to get food and shelter along the way? 
 

A: Whatever we had, we sold 
for  my mother sold
 for food. We didn't eat very well.  We 
had bread and potatoes. I don't think we 
ate any meat or anything like this. 
 
Q: Was your family religious
ly  observant? Did you keep 
kosher? And was it difficult to 
get food? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was it difficult to get food along th e way? 
 
A: No, not  maybe. 
 
Q: Did you need to get kosher food alon
g the way? Was that a problem for you? 
 
A: Maybe there was a little bit kosher food, b
ecause this was forbidden by the German, 
so, and it was very expensive. We liv
ed mo stly on bread and potatoes. 
 
Q: When  you did finally arrive at 
the town, where didyou go to live? 
 
A: We live in the grandfather  
mo ther's, mo ther of my  brothe
rs, and they are first one. We 
lived very crowded, because so
me others were with us. Uncl

also came to live there. Oh, 
I think we  we lived abou
t 12 people in a tworoom, 
twobedroom apartment.

the town in Czestochowa?

42, when  when...

Q: Can you tell me what the conditions were 
in the ghetto? Was it 
a closedinghetto? Was 
there a wall or fen
ce around the ghetto? 
 
A: No, but  not at first. But 
later on, they started deportation, they  force out, out of the 
worse part of the city, all the parts of the c
ity. And we had a grandfather clock, and inside 
was taken to repair, so this was missing. Th
is was before the war, when they saw that. 
They  kick ed my  brother down the steps, the step
. It took us half a year, I think, to get to 
CzestochowA: In Czes
tochowa was my  grandmother's apar
tment, and we live down there 
very crowded, because some others were, I th
ink, my brother, my un
cle, I remember, was 
also kicked out from his place. 
He lived in Ta

conditions in the ghetto, and I wanted to

Q: But at first it was the armb

t she was thrown out, too. So
 my  mo th er thought she had 
property in another city, in 
Czestochowa, so we only went

about a half year to get there. 
 
Q: But in the ghetto, in Czesto chowa, you said that there we

ghetto, and you had told  me that

deported Jews, and we went to the cella

bread and potatoes. 
 
Q: How long were you in the cellar? 
 
A: I think six weeks. Six. And my brother 
looked out, looked out to
 the hall, down the 
wall, and he saw, saw that, that they are 
calling all the Jews goi
ng to work. So little by 
little, we w ent out, too. So we join

A: The Russian. 
 
Q: Where were you when the Russians cam

when the Russians 
came in? 
 
A: In the cellar. My brother looked out throu
gh the hole in the cellar. We had to have 
some air, and he saw the Russi
an soldiers. So he told us
, and little by little, we came out 
from the cellars. 
 
Q: How were you treated by the Russians?
 How were you treated by the Russians? 
 

A: Well, they could say they roughed us, an
d others were indifferent. My brother was 
roughed some of the time by the 
Russians. They had a gun, so. 
 
Q: What did you do after you were liberat
ed by th e Russians? What did you do in 
Czestochowa? Now that the Russians are th er
e and the Germans are gone, what did you 
do in  terms of work ? How did you live and get food? 
 
A: I really don't know what to tell you. We 
have some money left. I mean, there wasn't 
much. There was some gold coin
s, what my brother had. So
 we sold it little by little. And 
yes, I had some, some money left too, wh at my
 brother gave. So  we sold  we didn't  live 
very well, but we were 
not hungry. We lived mo s
tly on bread and potatoes.

ee years to get the degree in pharmacy. And 
after that, I thought I 
go to Israel, since we  the Eng

don't reme mb er too good. So  I got stuck in 
Germany, and I went to school there. And 
later, I just  I decided to go to Isr

Q: Which refugee camp? 
 
A: Oh, I don't know. It had a name.

A: I met my husband in Bergen
Belsen. That was in Germany. 
 
Q: How did you get to be in Berg enBelsen? 
 
A: I had a cousin  down there.  Since I was 
fairly young, I think I
