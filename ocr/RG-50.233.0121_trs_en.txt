 
Interview with Michael M. Scislowski 
August 19, 2992 
 
Q: We  can just start with your name .   

 

A: My name  is Michael Scislowski, Polish pr
onunciation Michal Schislowski.  I was born in 
Siedlce, Poland. The town is located approxi
ma tely 100 kilome ters fromWa rsaw which is 
about 60 miles, east.  In 1933–     
 

Q: Let™s just get your birth date
 also, your date of birth. 
 

A: Date of birth, September 30, 1922.  In 1933 I 
was a gramma r school pupil going to school near 
Ruvna in Polish Ukraine area which was called in PolishWo in. 
 

Q: This was public school? 

 

A: That was public school, yes.  I graduated from 
the school in 1935.  I lived
 there with my father, 
my mother and sister.  My father was a military career  offi cer who had fa ntastic talent in 

organizing or chestra bands or amateur theaters anywhere we went and because of being military 

person he wa s rotated on his duty from one   plac
e to another, therefore we recognized and lived 
in ma ny, ma ny towns on the eastern Polish bor
der.  He was comparing withAmerican 
organization was similar to FBI. 
 

Q: So it was an investigative branch of the– 

 
A: An investigative counterespionage, army count
er-espionage intelligence service. So in 1935 
after graduating from gra mmar school, my father
 was transferred to another town north of 
Ruvna by name  of Kostopol which is now in Russi
an territory.And he didn™t want me  to waste 
time on learning Ukrainian language and therefore 
he brought me  to my gr andmother ™s place, 
back to Siedlce where I was 
born and I enrolled to gymnasi
um which is Polish high school. 
 
Q: Wa s it a special gymnasium or just general studies? 

 

A: No, it was general studies, right. And how different a
nd how more informative Polish 
gymnasium was compar ed withAme r ican high 
school, then you know yourself.  So I was in 

Siedlce in first and second year
 of high school and then I join
ed my father who requested 
transfer to area where he could 
have also high school in town 
and he receivedWilno district, 
Vilna now is capitol of Lithuani a but it was Po
lish and nearWi lno was town by name  of 
Wilaka,Wi l aka Poyeto. So I completed high sc
hool, the third and fourth year inWilaka.. 
 

Q: Your whole fa mily was there? 

 

A: And my fa mily was there, right. 

 

Q: Did you have a particular subject that 
was most interesting 
to you at the time ?  
 

A: All subjects were dictated by 
national education system and theref
ore the beauty of this was that 
no matter where anybody from military family or 
any other the child was transferred from one 

town to another at this particular town you f
ound exactly the same  program in every subject.  
And we had twelve subjects including geography
 that in this country kids don™t even know 
whereWa shington D.C. is. 
 

Q: You took languages there and Germa n? 

 

A: In order to graduate from Polish high sc
hool you had to know two foreign languages and one 
classic.  So I had Germa n and French and Latin 
language as classic.  So in 1939 I should have 
started Liceum.  Liceum was approxima tely corresponding withAmerican college, first year of 

c o l l e ge . 
 

Q: That™s a generic name, Liceum? 

 

A: Liceum,L-I-C-E-U-M. 

 

Q: Oh, like the French. 

 

A: Like the French.  So when war broke out, Se
ptember 1, that was our fi
rst day of school. And 
imme diately after the ceremony we
 started digging trenches. 
 

Q: Did they tell you why? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah, we knew i mme diately that war br
oke out and Germany attacked Poland, at four 
o™clock I understand in the morning. 
 

Q: What were these trenches like that you were digging?  
 
A: They were just like in the frontlines, any acti
on, any military action in th
e fr ont lines, trenches. 
They were about seven feet deep covered with
 some  heavy materials and then covered with 
topsoil. So fr om the top, from the airplane you couldn™t see it, camouflaged. 
 

Q: This was still in theWilno district you were in? 

 

A: Yeah, inWilaka where the high school was, 
on the high school territory
. We ll so you could see 
that we couldn™t proceed with our lessons b
ecause the action, Germans, were appr oaching 
Wa rsaw almost every day. 
 

Q: Where was your father, was he
 mobi lized to go some place else? 
 

A: No, my father was stillw
ith us until September 17.  On September 17 the Soviet Russia 
attacked Poland according to agreement with th
e Germans.  Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement.  
And they gave us the final blow in the bac
k.  So we didn™t know how they would behave 
entering Polish territory so my father took us, 
my  sister, mother, myself, took us with him on 

the evacuation trip fromWilaka toWilno.  On our
 way there we have seen already preparations 
of Polish troops to fight th
e approaching Soviet tanks. 
 

Q: But the Polish army was relativel y weak. 

 

A: Weak, yes, and it was already in very much in 
disastrous situation. Ther
efore, he left us in 

Wilno with his friends and went 
with his group of agents he said
 to headquarter, I believe, to 
headquarter, and I have never seen hi m again until 
after war. So as I unde
rstand they crossed the 
Lithuanian border, Lithuania was for a few more
 days free, and when the Russians came , all 
these Polish military personnel was taken by the 
Russians and sent to va rious concentration 
camps. 
 
Q: Who were you staying with inWilno, you said they were friends of your father? 

 

A: Friends of my father, yes. 

 

Q: Militaryfr iends? 

 

A: Military friends fromWorldWa r 1. And then
 the Soviets ordered all 
people should return to 
their homes.  So we went back toWilaka. A
nd after a few weeks they orde red all st udents 

return to their classes, but because  of the extra-curriculum given by Russians in Russian 

language in Communist hi
story, in party Communist history,
 we were taken one year back -- 
because they told us we complete our e
ducation as Communi sts 
after two years of 
indoctrination. 
 

Q: So you were in classes learning 
Russian now and Soviet propaganda? 
 

A: Ye s and Soviet Communist Party history. 

 

Q: How did you personally feel about this? 

 

A: We ll, you had absolutely nothing to say. You to
lerated but you were definitely disgusted about 
this and we were trying to ma ke some sort of ir
onic remarks all the time during the classes.  But 

our teachers were army offi
cers and they were Jewish. 
 

Q: They pretty much replaced
 teachers that were there? 
 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: So all your other studi
es went by the wayside? 
 

A: No, other studies, a few of our teachers es
caped, and whoever escaped was replaced by the 
army teachers, Russian army teachers. Well 
I attended Communist classe s until January 1
st
, 
1940. That was if some body still is alive could re
me mber, we had the worst, the strongest, the 
coldest winter of my time. Th
e temp erature very often was dr
opped to mi nus 40 degrees. And 
during the night like that, with of
 course certain agreement with my mother, I decided to escape 
toWa rsaw.  So I took the train and I went to 
the last station before the borderline between 

Russian occupation zone of Poland a
nd German occupation zone of Poland. 
 

Q: Why did you want to escape?  What  was your goal? 

 

A: Good question, because they started to arresting 
all Polish intelligent family me mbers such as 
doctors, lawyers, former police departme nt me mbers. 
 

Q: So clearly your father if he we
re there would have been a target. 

 
A: Yeah, and I would be a target, de
finitely.  So I decided to escape. 
 

Q: That was in January? 

 

A: That was January 1940. Ta king advantage of -- 
they gave us two weeks vacation.  So arriving 
to this last station I had to go about five m
iles on foot with a group of some people.They 
thought I know more about the lo
cation of the border line than
 themselves. And I led them 
directly to the guards building and when we st
arted running away, they noticed us and they 
started shooting. 
 

Q: These were the Russian guards? 

 

A: Russian guards and I was caught first time when I 
tried to cross the border. And as penalty they 
placed us in the brick outhouse in
 the lower level where I had to
 stand in excrement, human 
excrement up to my kne es.  So I couldn™t kneel. 
I couldn™t relax, nothing.  I had to stand there 
for three days before they took us out and they
 told us, now go back toWi laka and you should 
study because you are a young student and you will be 
a good Consume r  (?). Then I cried but I 

had to try again.  So with my second try, 
instead of turning left, I turned right. 
 

Q: Did you go all the way back toWilaka? 

 

A: NO, NO, NO, NO.  Right after this ma ybe I we nt
 two kilometers towards 
the station and then I 
turned sideways when I noticed, because that 
was during the night, I no
ticed they couldn™t see 
me  anymore and I tried again, with the help, of
 course, of one guy who wa s also crossing not 
the first time. And he helped me  out and I f
ound myself on the other side in the morning.   
People on the borderline were very wonderful people
. They fed me , they washed me  a little bit, 

because I stunk like a beaver.And after a few hour
s I arrived to Siedlce because I thought my 
grandmother is still in my place where I was born, 
Siedlce. When I arrived there I only met my 
aunt.  My grandmother was inWa rsaw at that
 time .  So between January of 1940 -- oh while 
reaching the destination, I sent a message to my 
mother inWilaka a friend who was leaving for 
Wilno because he had a family over there. 
 

Q: Wa s he crossing from the German side? 

 

A: He was crossing from the German side to the 
Russian side. And I give him description how I 
crossed and I urged them also to try to come
 over. You see the difference between Russian 
occupational zone and German was that they we
re both death enemies of Poland.  However, on 
the German side you could at least dress as a 
civilized people. You 
could use your tie, you 
could use your hat, you could use 
your nice shirt, versus
 looking like a peasant all the time  and 
be completely as a savage looking. So this is, you should reme mber, this is the reason why so 

ma ny peopl e couldn™t stand Communists because th
at was hypocrisy to the highest extent.  
Now what struck me  first on my arrival to Sied
lce that Jewish people, they were wearing the 
armbands with the St ar of David and they had 
to take hats off and step aside before every 
German sol dier.  So you could see that that was 
horribl e experience right 
from the start. And I 
was wondering right then how long I 
would be safe in this area. 
 

Q: Did anybody ever check your 
documents at that time ?  
 

A: No, No, nobody– 
 

Q: Once you were there they just assumed–.. 

 

A: Yeah, once you were there–..It took me  one m
onth to take bath,Turkish bath every day in 
order to get rid of the smell I ab
sorbed sitting in that outhouse ther
e.  It was horrible.We ll, I  
started working in Siedlce fi rst at  the construc
tion to clean, because Siedlce was also bo mbed 
during the war and there were ma ny ma sonry build
ings that required re
moval.And the break 
was the price of gold so we were cleaning from
 t he mortar, we were cleaning every brick and– 
 

Q: How would you clean the mortar off? 

 

A: With chisels, and once you cleaned a thousa
nd bricks a day, you had good pay. And so I 
worked there, but it was too hard for me .  So 
after two months, that was about March, in March 
I me t one friend who suggested to me  we s
hould open photographic business because Germans 
were taking pictures of all 
the Polish ruins and Polish vari
ous monume nts and everything. 
 

Q: Had the Germans assigned you to that task of cleaning up the buildings? 

 

A: No, no that was private.  
It was private Polish company. 
 

Q: Did you have to clean a thousand a day to get paid? 

 

A: No, no, no. 

 

Q: But if you cleaned a thousand you would get reasonable pay? 
 
A: Yeah, you could work two days or three days 
but you were paid for one thousand bricks. And I 
went in business developing pictures.  I knew this because  we had our own darkroom inWilaka. 
 

Q: In your home? 

 

A: In my home , yeah, so I wa s photographing bugs since I was nine years old. 

 

Q: You had a camera? 

 

A: I had camera, yes. So it was easy for me  and 
I was ma king good prints and everything. That™s  
why we had fantastic business. 
 

Q: Did you actually have a store? 

 

A: We  had a store, yeah, we had a store in
 a half demolished building, but it was okay. 
 

Q: That™s extraordinary. What about getting supplies?  Wa s it relatively– 

 

A: The Germans were giving you supplies. The 
Germans were bringing s
upplies to your store.  
Therefore, you were allowed to charge them just
 for your labor. They were giving you prices 
for every print, every enlargement, whatever. 
 

Q: Do you remember developing a
nything especially interesting? 
 
A: Oh we collected some  nice, yeah, they we
re very fond of taking 
pictures of the hanging 
ceremony and we had quite a bit of collecti
on of German photogra
phers indicating the 
executions. 
 

Q: We re these Jews mostly that they hung? 

 

A: No, no, anybody who was against 
them who was  caught doing so
me thing that they -- for 
everything, as you know ma ybe, ev
erything was death penalty, 
no ma tter what you did, against 
the Reich it was death penalty.  Now, my mother
 and sister arrived inWa rsaw in May 1940.  
They had also tremendous, tremendous difficultie
s. They were separated for 48 hours during 
their trip and my mother thought 
that they kidnapped my sister because she was only, at that 
time, ma ybe  twelve years old. 
 

Q: We re you living with your aunt? 

 

A: I was living with my 
aunt, yeah, in Siedlce. 

 

Q: And that™s where the store was, in Siedlce. 

 

A: In Siedlce, yeah, before my mother and sister
 arrived. When my mother
 and sister arrived in 
Wa rsaw she sold everything what we had, possibl
y whatever was available and in their clot hing 
and various pieces of undergarme nts se sewed 
in all the bank notes, high bank notes of one 

thousand zloty. 
 
Q: So we collected, it was a very nice sum, wh
en we tear off all these garment we found quite a 
nice sum of money. And that was the last day in
Wa rsaw to exchange the old Polish money into 
the general governme nt, they were called general 
governme nt money.  And we decided to open 
a business. And then betweenWa rsaw and Sied
lce is Minsk Mazowiecki and we decided to go 
back to our fi rst family town when everybody 
knew us and we knew that if some thing goes 
wrong, we will get help. And theref
ore the first try was to open a regular general st or e in Mi nsk 
Mazowiecki. And since the only place for the 
building was in suburbs didn™t go so well, so 
therefore my mother obtained somehow lease 
of the building on the ma in street.And she 
decided to change from general store to delica
tessen. And we had fantastic business. We  had 
fantastic business and I could st
art attending various classes and 
getting my  education because 
as you know, once Germans occupied Poland, they liquidated all high schools, lyceums, 
college s, and universities.  Only
 the grammar schools were open b
ecause they told us that we 
are designated as labor force only. 
 

Q: Right, so all you need is 
a certain level of education. 

 

A: Right, they don™t need Po
lish intellectua
ls anymore. 
 

Q: Where were you able 
to take classes then? 
 

A: No, no, they were secret instru
ctions given to us by Polish prof
essors. And I continued later on 
when I tell you after my first arrest .  So I was in
 Minsk Mazowiecki till, no 
let™s say this, at that 
time I also started learning English. There my fi
r s t English classes were taking place.  Maybe I 

told you before I had nice big family, so my fi
rst cousins who lived inWa rsaw were arrested 
and sent toAuschwitz. That was June of 1940.  
One of the m is still 
alive and I now contact 
with him, so he promised to contribute so
me thing also to the museum inWa shington. 
 
Q: Why was he  arrested?  Wa s he in the underground? 

 

A: No, no, they knew that all Polish youngsters
, they like to work unde
rground. They didn™t 
realize yet that we already had 
certain first beginning of the u
nderground organizations but they 
were trying to -- they started in 1940 in June 
arresting ma ny youngsters.  So I was even hiding 
in the at tics, in the cellars, just not to be su
rprised during the night wh
en they come and take 
you away. 
 

Q: We re you actually working in the undergr
ound then or did they 
suspect any young person? 
 

A: No, no, not yet, they suspect
ed any young person, not yet. 
 

Q: So just as a preventative, they figured they
 mi ght as well arrest them before they start 
some thing. 
 

A: That™s  right, correct.  So 
in Novembe r  of 1940 being locate
d on the ma in street of Minsk 
Mazowiecki we noticed first move ment of Germ
an troops toward the east.  Okay, that™s  
important fact. And we were wondering, what the hell for. 
 

Q: Did several columns come  through your town? 

 

A: Ye s. 
 
Q: Mechanizedcolumns? 

 

A: Mechanized columns, yeah. And as you know
 Brazilitov which was the borderline between 
Germans and Russians, it was ma ybe  another 150
 miles.  In January 1941 my friend started 
talking about underground organization to fight 
the Germans right here in Minsk Mazowiecki 
that was January 1941.  In March of 1941 we no
ticed increased move me nt of Ger man troops 
east and as you know in June of 1941 Germany atta
cked Soviet Russia. And that was end of 
their friendship and collaboration. 
 During this time  inWa rs aw 
the firstWapanki,Wapanki, it 
was type of certain -- the idea of closing the st
reets and avenues in such a way that whoever is 
trapped in this four or six bloc
ks together was led to one only ex
it and was identified and if they 
caught, few times they caught very important 
people of underground organizations and other 
Polish famo us guys. 
 

Q: So it was almost like rounding up cattle, livest
ock, getting into a smaller and smaller area? 
 

A: Ye s. And the same  way there were hostages 
al so select ed fr om this
 kind of engagement. Now 
between June ™41 andAugust ™42 there were
 continuousWa panki, 
continuous arrests, 
continuous, no ma tter where. Even Minsk Mazowi
ecki was no more safe anymore. And now 
one morning, at six o™clock in the morning wh
en I was going to my uncle™s house for certain 
information, I was passing by the Ukrainian SS tr
oops who were stationed at the beginning on 
the east side of Minsk Mazowiecki borderline of 
the township and there we
re plenty of them, I 
would say about entire company, about 100 peopl
e.  I was wondering what happened, and when 

I was staying with my uncle because we had business together–.  
 
Q: He was part of the deli? 

 

A: He was part of the deli, yah, he had his own 
business also.And what we
 learned that they came 
to liqui date Jewish section of Minsk Mazowiecki 
who were the ma rket place was in front of the 
Ca t hol i c  c h ur c h . 
 

Q: Was there a ghetto there?  

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Just a Jewish neighborhood? 

 

A: Jewish neighborhood, yes.They took all of them into the ma rketplace.   It was a nice area about 
300 me ters by 300 me ters, that would be 900 feet 
by 900 feet. They concentrated them and the 
Ukrainians shot them dead.  So th
e bl ood was floating all over the pl ace. 
 

Q: They shot wome n and children? 

 

A: Everybody, yeah.  I mean, some  of them who we re
 able to escape, they we re escaping. Before 
that ma ssacre they were forcing the Jewish 
gvina (? ) rabbis to donate
 to commandateur, the 
commanding officer of the garrison of Minsk M
azowiecki about one kilogram of gold every 
two months or every three months I cannot tell. 
 But we knew that they were forced because 
Jewish friends told us that they had to donate
 all gold.  Once they stri
pped them with entire 
possessions, then 
they killed them. 
 

Q: Did you see this ma ssacre? 

 

A: I saw only after ma ssacre when they were usi
ng rema ining Jewish people to load the bodies on 
the tracks and taking them away to some  ma ssive graves. 
 

Q: Wa s that the first real atrocity you saw committed by the SS? 

 

A: I would say so. We ll, I saw hanging executions 
in Siedlce when I came. That was my first 
experience. That was my first experience of atro
cities. And here I appr
oached the end of my 
freedom for the first time in September of 1942. 
 I was arrested and kept overnight by the 
Ukrainians in their SS garrison in Minsk Mazowi eck
i and then the very next morning I was sent 
together with a group of about thirty kids toWa rsaw. 
 

Q: Did they send you by truck or walk you or..? 

 

A: Sent by truck, by truck. 

 

Q: Did they ever give a reason for arresting you? 

 

A: No, no. The y came -- I was with my  mother and 
my sister in the store 
during the day and they 
took me  from the store. 
 

Q: The Ukrainian SS have a fairly ba
d reputation.  Did you 
agree with that? 
 
A: Oh,absolutely. 

 

Q: That they were ruthless? 

 

A: Ruthless, especially to Poles, because they
 were pushed by the Germans and the Germans were 
smart. They didn™t do this biggest atrociti
es. They were always taking some body who was 
serving them well.  Okay, that™s  what happene
d. Now I was held in ??  I think that wa s 
warehouse or high school, I don™t recall. There 
we re ma ny, many empty halls where they kept 
all these kids, few hundred kids were kept th
ere. And checking my health, checking my 
structure, medical examination, they told me I 
would be send to ma in post office inVi enna to 
work. And I saw my mo ther for the last
 for the two weeks that I was there. 
 

Q: You were held in this warehouse for two weeks? 

 

A: Two weeks, yeah, and my mother was there ev
ery day crying so I tried to tell her, don™t worry 
about me , don™t worry about me .  She said one of
 my uncles promised to help us. And really 
combining our money together because I believe she had to pa y 7,000 zlot y to the chief guard 

and he let me go.  But I wouldn™t dare to go back
 to Minsk Mazowoecki. Therefore, I rema ined 
inWarsaw and here I really joined the lyceum 
courses, that wa s confidential courses arranged 
by professors of colleges and universities for 
the kids who couldn™t go to school any longer. 
 

Q: What did they teach you? 

 

A: They were teaching me  everythi ng, ma the matics, 
all the courses that are 
necessary.  I at that 
time already decided to become an arch
itect.  So History 
of Architectur e. 
 

Q: Where did they hold the classes? 

 

A: The classe s were held in each professor ™s privat
e home .  So we had to travel all overWa rsaw.  
One class was held onWilsa St reet, another cl
ass on Dubra St reet and from Dubra back again 
on Marshallkoska St reet. 
 

Q: How ma ny s t udents were with you at a time, usually? 

 

A: Usually the complete was six kids in a class. 

 

Q: And you paid the professors? 

 

A: No, whoever was able to pay, 
he paid, whoever not they wereall patriotically 
inclined.  Nobody 
even thought about ma terial gains. And also at 
that time  I started taking lessons on piano, piano 
lessons. 
 

Q: Where were you living? 

 

A: I was living with my unc le who bought -- I cont
ributed some  of my m
oney and some of my 
mother ™s mo ney and we bought apartment on Dubra 
St reet, 53, corner of Radna.  So that was 
September of 1942.  October more arrests, more hostages, more executions. That was the time  

that Jewish ghetto was enclosed completely. 
 
Q: You™re caught within the Jewish ghetto at that 
time, that is within the ar ea they desi gnated?   I 
know a lot of Poles who moved out. 
 

A: No, no.  I was not affected because 
I was closer toVi stula River area. 
 

Q: You recall watching them build the wall, I suppose. 

 

A: Ye s, yes, I was passing on a streetcar ma ny 
ti me s through the ghetto. And at the beginning 
when I was there the life was norma l.You coul
dn™t recognize any differences only it looked 
very congested, looked very congested. 
 

Q: This was the street car that  actually we
nt in the ghetto and out the other side? 

 

A: Right, it had to pass by. What I would like to 
stress here, Kevin, please believe me  this is not 
propaganda. Whoever wanted to leave or escape,
 he could. The Jewish gmina me mbers, the 
highest instance in ghetto, that 
were ruling spiritually also an
d morally entire population, they 
never believed that the Germans 
would liquidate them and that was the biggest mi stake because 
they had whoever wanted to go, he could. 
 

Q: If they wanted to get out 
there they could try to get out? 
 

A: Absolutely, even jumping at the stop, jumping 
into the tramway and wh -- t, you™re out. You 
take off the band. The only thing is whoever was 
looking Jewish, he had no chance, that™s  true.  
That was Mother Nature™s dirty trick.   If you happened to look similar to other faces by all 
means you c ould save. And they were saved, 
ma ny, ma ny thousands, hundred thousands were 
saved. 
 

Q: Did you ever hear of the group Jagoda? 

 

A: Ye s,yes. 

 

Q: I know that they saved a lot of Jews inWa rsaw. 

 

A: Oh sure, and how ma ny thousands were executed
 because they were tryi ng to save.  I know a 
few around the village in Minsk Mazo
wiecki.  It was rough.  So let™
s go because we never finish 
this. 
 

Q: I won™t ask more questions. 

 

A: No, no, ask me , ask me , it™s wonderful, ask me  
because I will supplement you imme di ately with 
my opinion if I have any.  In 1942, Christma s time now, I took a chance.  Ca me  to Minsk 

Mazowiecki at night with my friend for Christma s 
Eve dinner. And that was the last time I saw 
my mother, grandmother and sister.  Now 1943 J a nuary–. 
 

Q: Was that Christmas Eve meal or 
Christma s day meal or just around–? 

 

A: Christmas Eve meal because Christmas Eve me
al that just  like Jewish holidays are fa lling 

always at night like Friday night
, like Shabbat Shalom. Well in 
January I was sworn into ZWZ, 
ZwiazekWalki Zbrojnej. That was the organiza
tion which was precedingAK,Ar mi a Krajowa.  
And together with my friend, St anchachovski a
nd we two were sworn in by Bal-Komor owski 
himself. 
 

Q: This was inWa rsaw? 

 

A: That was inWa rsaw, yeah. 

 

Q: I™m not fa mi liar with him. 

 

A: He was the commander- in-chief of
 all organizations at that time. 
 

Q: We re you nervous about doing this? 

 

A: Oh, sure, yeah.  Now I received the first und
erground work in the rail
road machine shop in 
Praga.  Praga is on the other side ofWa rsaw.  
On one bank is calledWa rs
aw and another side is 
Wa rsaw Praga, okay?  And not a lot of fun because on March 19, 1943 hoping that my  uncle is 

at the doors of my apartment at six o™clock 
in the morning, I opened the doors and that was 
Gestapo. 
 

Q: They were knocking at the door? 

 

A: Knocking on the door, yeah. 

 

Q: What kind of work were you doi
ng in the railroad machine shop? 
 

A: Working as a carpent er. That™s why I almost 
saved my life later on in 
the concentration camp 
because I declared myself a carpenter. 
 

Q: When you were sworn in what was the philosoph
y of the underground?   I™m sure they said that 
our goals are to –.. 
 

A: –to free, free Poland of enemies, yeah, regardless of whether they were Germans or Russians. 

 

Q: So since was the predecessor to theAK this was also an armed resistance group? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: What did they have you build? 

 

A: Have me  build, what do you mean? 

 

Q: As a carpenter what were you building for them?  

 

A: Oh, no, that was some  pa rts. You wouldn™t know
.You would never know what is the final item.  
So you had only parts, certain hundreds of pieces 
of lumber cut to certain piece. It wa s on 
various tact. 
 

Q: Assemblyline? 
 

A: Assembly line, yes.  So please reme mber they
 entered apartment at six o™clock in the morning 
and at seven o™clock, one hour later, I was in 
Poliak prison, shaved, undressed and thrown into 
the baseme nt solitary compartment. And then I 
st arted cryi ng.  Because I said what the hell for 
honestly, what have I done, I di
dn™t do anything yet so as to be
 locked up.  So during my 
presence in Poliak I was interrupted by Gest
apo three time s onAlaya Shucha where the 
headquarters of Gestapo was. Alaya Shucha.  
And probably you heard about tramway we called 
the special room of the sizes about 25 by 12 or 25 by 15 rooms that people who were waiting to 

be interrogated had to wait with 
face the opposite dead wall.  A
nd the guard was behind you.  If 
you turn only a little bit of
 degrees left or right, he calls you to the passage and you have to 
make one hundred sit-ups until you were exhausted. 
 

Q: They call that the tramway, this corridor–..? 

 

A: Each room. The tramway was each room.  So sh
ortly after that I was taken to the department 
five in the Pa via called Fi fth Floor .I can re
me mb er now which wasTr ansport floor and with 
our prayers because we didn™t wa
nt to stay in Poliak on May 
3 since that was famous Polish 
holiday and usually they 
were executing hostages. 
 

Q: Those interrogations, what did they 
ask you or what did they say to you? 
 

A: They were, first of all they were asking you 
are a me mber, we know that you are a me mber of 
underground. Te ll us only who was with you and then we let you go.That was the famous 

statement, a very naïve one, so you had to have 
power, will power to tell them all the time that 

you don™t belong to any other organization and you 
have never belonged 
to any organization.  
They were beating up with a stick from top of h
ead to the end of your behind, entire back. You 
had red and purple when you came back to Poviak prison. 
 

Q: So any time you didn™t answer–..? 

 

A: Correct, you got beating.  So we arrived to–.O
h I should me ntion that now, shortly before our 
departure, ghetto uprisingtook place and we saw through our windows how Ger mans were 

systematically going from one building to anothe
r dropping napalm bomb s into the basement to 
be sure that entire building will catch fl ames
.And whoever was hiding in the building, if he 

didn™t come  out, then he burned to death. Ther
e were some  constant day and night machine 
guns and single shots fired. We  couldn™t sleepbecause of that and because of tremendous 

smoke that penetrated th
e windows of the prison. 
 

Q: You had a window in the cell you were held in? 

 

A: Yeah,yeah. 

 

Q: This was a group cell? 

 

A: Group cell on the top floor.  I was already in th
eTr ansport floor so absorbed most of the smoke. 
 

Q: Then you could see the ghetto from that window? 

 

A: Ye s, you could see the streets also, the tanks 
on one hand and some  individuals shooting at the 
tanks from a nother end of the street.  So that was the end. The smoke was  still on when they 
took us to a transport and we arrived to theWa rs
aw freight station and pl
aced eighty prisoners 
in one freight car. Total of
 transport was 1,200 prisoners. 
 

Q: AllfromPoviak? 

 

A: FromPoviak. 

 

Q: These were the cattle cars they put you in? 

 

A: Cattle cars, yeah. One more thing that I shoul
d me ntion because it was si gnificant. Wa s adding 
to our tortures was the amount of bedbugs that
 wa s eating you alive du
ring the night and you 
couldn™t escape because when you even slept on the table providing every leg of the table into a 

pail of water, they were crawling on the wa
ll and then on the ceili
ng and dropping on your body 
from the ceiling directly.  It was amazing.  It
 was completely impossible to fight them. 
 

Q: They give you some  
food within the prison? 
 

A: Ye s, you were getting very small amount.  We ll 
now things were rolling very fast now because 
betweenWa rsaw and Piajkov the very next big 
station going west fromWa rsaw few guys who 
worked in Poviak in the machine shop, they 
some how s muggled hand drill at their body so 
when I found myself with them in the same  cattl
e car, with small holes they drill through a few 
planks, wooden planks, removed it from the t
op and you could slide down and upward between 
the channels, steel channels
 there were wooden planks. 
 
Q: This was the floor of the car? 
 

A: No, that was side, between the buffers, between
 the cars, parallel with the trucks. And they 
removed fe w planks, enough for human body to go through. They just placed themselves 

nicely under the buffers and one after another 
started escaping because the caboose where the 
soldiers were never expected first some body 
mi ght escape.They were playing cards or 
some thing, did not paying attention.  So the first 
few, seven only, were able to escape.  I was 
also in the line to escape but the first s
hot was fired as noticed them running away. 
 

Q: This was daytime? 

 

A: Daytime, yes. And their nice situation was th
at the machinist were a
ppalled so he rode the 
engine for another ma ybe half a mile before
 he stopped.  So they had enough area to be 
separated from the train so they didn™t  bothe
r to chase them.  But all the madness they 
concentrated on the car where we were in. 
 

Q: Right, some body was going to suffer for this. 

 

A: Right, so when the train stoppe
d, the first SS jumped on the buffer, taking advantage of this 
open spot through which they escaped and he emp
tied entire ma gazine of the ma chine gun.  So 
he killed two guys and he wounded about five guys
.  I heard only whistle above my head so for 
the first time I had a barrel of 
the gun facing against me . Tha t  was the first time.  Imme diately 
they opened the doors and they took 
us all out and it was some small how to say, it™s not village, 

it™s not town. 
 
Q: It™s  the railroad siding? 

 

A: Railroad siding, people who lived 
closed to railroad tracks.  Pu
t us against the fence with two 
machine guns right on both sides and the officer 
started telling us now who was the leader we 
want to know or you will all be shot.  So people 
next to me  already st arted giving certain smell 
away and everything physiological 
part of your body is very weak
 if you™re under duress. And 
something was telling me all the time that this
 is not the place where you™re going to die and I 
was kept so I went cool.  No
w we we re lucky.  In our gr
oup there was one fellow who spoke 
perfect German. We  knew Ger man language but not
 to such extent as 
could assume  you are of 
German origin.  But this guy was fantastic and he
 told with certain respect. You should know 
before you execute us he said that it was not 
our will. They ha d gun, they had instruments, 

everything ready for their escape and it was not 
our fault that you have not probably cleared 
them or caught them when you were loading us at the platform. And that was reason that he got 

ma d but he realized that he was telling the trut
h.  It is possible. Th
at was not a story but 
possible to accept. And he opene
d ne xt two cars, split the gr oup 
in half and put additional guys 
on both cars and we quietly arrived toAuschwitz. 
That was eleven o™clock in the evening.  
 

Q: So it was a full days journey? 

 

A: Full day journey. And the soldiers were sti
ll ma d at us and they were wounding people with 
bayonets pushing us between the platform, railroad platform and the ma in gate of the camp. It 

was also quite an area, maybe half a kilome ter or 
so.  So during this small distance they still had 
a chance to wound few prisoners wi
th their bayonet. When we 
arrived there nothing happened. 
We  were in such a disarray and tired. The 
very next morning they told us to undress. 
 

Q: Where did they hold you overnight? 

 

A: In one of the barracks -- get undressed, washed, 
and before we got cup of tea you mi ght call.  
That was some thing -- combination of all kind of 
herbs collected from the fields dried and they 

were ma king tea out of this weeds, giving us to
 drink every morning.  So I didn™t drink, I only 
rinsed my mouth and brushed my teeth. The ne
xt thing was to be sure that everybody™s name  
they have and we received a tattoo. And please ma rk the number, 119431 
 

Q: So they issued you the uniforms  also with the vinkel on it? 

 

A: Oh no, not yet.  Only the next day or so.  So
 I was taken to one of the barracks and there were 
attendants checking twice.  First time at si
x o™clock in the morning and second time at six 
o™clock at night.  Since the enti
re area was still not completely adjusted the ground was mud so 
after rain, there were puddles.  
That was my first experience with
 the assistant to kapo.You™re 
supposed to stand in a row that would be perf
ect horizontally, 90 degr
ees between rows and 
lines. 
 

Q: This was theAppell? 

 

A: Appell, yes.  So when there was a puddle, huge 
puddle in front of me  so 
I stood little bit off the 
line, the guy came to me and pushed me into th
e puddle with tremendous blow with a stick that 
they were carrying similar to the baseball stic
k, baseball bat, and he
 said, you SOB you are 

afraid of what, are you gonna dr
ink this water..  From now on
 don™t forget that you are not a 
ma n you are only a number. And I think that was 
quite characteristic.  I never forgot this 
because I realized that I was onl
y a nu mber from now on. Aft er 
two weeks being in Birkenau.. 
 
Q: We re you pretty much idle at th
at time, they weren™t working you?   
 

A: Yeah, we were working on the Fraulager th
at means preparing the area to be occupied by 
wome n that™s supposed to arrive to Bi rkenau. 
Birkenau is notAuschw
itz.  Please distinguish 
these two locations.  One is apar t fr om another 
approxima tely one mile.And all transports to 
Birkenau always, not toAuschwitz just like my tr
ansport. After two weeks I was transferred to 
Auschwitz thanks to my  cousins because they we re
 fi rst inAuschwitz and they noticed fr om the 

list obtained from Schreibshtuber 
that I was in transport and th
ey took me  under pretext that I 
am sick. They took me  to Kreinkinbau, that 
means hospital inAuschwitz located -- buildings, 

number of buildings, I think 
24 or 25 some thing like that. 
 

Q: They told you to pretend you were sick? 

 

A: Pretend I am sick, yeah.  So 
one guard and me  walked from Bi rkenau toAuschwitz and when I 
arrived I me t imme diately I saw my c ousin but 
he told me  pretend that we don™t know each 
other.  He placed me  in the hospital and I was 
there for three days only and then rema in in 
Auschwitz but still since I did not have two 
weeks quarantine that was required for all 
newcomers we were calledTzuganga. Ts ugang is the new arrival. 
 

Q: What did you say you were sick with? 

 

A: Cold, cold, yeah, fever.  I wa
s there not quite two weeks as on
 quarantine because I fainted in 
the next week or so standing in line forA
ppell and when I was first time , I me t these two 
gentlemen from my hometown. Their names just 
to record them I have to me ntion Jan Musdorf 
and Oleg Guretsky and they saved my life because
 when I went to hospital for the second time I 
really had pneumonia in full swing with pleurisy
, water in my lungs, completely flooded, and if 
not for care of these two guys I 
wouldn™t live today.  Unfortunate
ly I mus t  tell you that one of 
them, Jan Musdorf, was executed as a me mber
 of the Underground.  Some body squealed when 
he was in camp inAuschwitz and he was executed 
together with other Polish patriots at the end 
of 1943. 
 

Q: With pneumonia did you go back to the hospital? 

 

A: No, I was recuperating and my friends since my
 cousin was an old prisoner, since June of 1940, 
he had ma ny, ma ny friends, and therefore they resp
ected old prisoners.  I wa
s kept in this block 
where there were after illness you had to recupe
rate.  Usually you were staying one week in 
hospital SS doctor was comi ng and sending you to gas chamber imme diately as anArbeit Shoy.  

Arbeit Shoy means afraid of work. So you had to 
be very careful. That™s  why I was always 
hiding, always hiding, lu
cky to have friends. 
 

Q: You stayed in a barrack hidden. 

 

A: Yeah, and now during my presence there, that
 wa s summer of ™43, a
nother atrocity occurred 
that could indicate what kind of inhuman treatme
nt you could expect from the Nazis. They 
executed first thirteen members of the surveying 
group that one of them e s caped. Thirteen were 

executed at BlackWall on Block number eleventh a
nd twelve rema ining after one mo nth just as 
an example that no one should even think about 
escaping, they hung them in front of all of us, 
twelve me mbers of the surveying group. 
 
Q: So one was shot and the rest were–? 

 

A: Thirteen were shot and tw
elve were hung. That was July 
17 of 1943, the execution took place. 
 

Q: So they made all the other pr
isoners come  out and watch this? 

 

A: And watch yeah, and they were hung in front of 
the kitchen. They were hung there for at least 
three days before the bodies were taken away
 and gallows was removed. And while I was on 
that -- I received a red point which meant in th
e distinction of the camp 
meant he™s not allowed 
to work outsi de the camp because they called 
us Fl ukfergocht which means suspected of any 
escape.  I received this probably because the Ge
stapo had me from the first, my first escape 
from the Skarasheska Street. And maybe all the 
guys who were with me  in this car, the train 
that was carrying us fromWa rsaw toAuschwitz.   
 

Q: This was that red triangle? 

 

A: No, under, below the number and the red triangle I had red point on white piece of cloth, red 
point here on my left side of my chest under th
e number, then on the right
 side of my l e g, right 
below the jacket and in the back I had also a 
red point and letters IL which meant in German 
ﬁI™m Lager.ﬂ 
 

Q: In camp.  You say a point. What did it look like? 
 
A: It was approximately one- inch di ameter that
 was red on white piece of cloth and here were 
letters IL. 
 

Q: So it looked some thing like a Japanese flag? 

 

A: Like a Japane se flag, yeah.  So my cousin 
said to me , Michael, you w
ill live  about two weeks, 
that™s all, because that wa s the approximate 
time elapsing between–..they didn™t want to keep 
the Im Lager, the Red Points in camp. You c
ould be shot after six o™clock when you were 
walking. After working hours when you were wa
lking in camp SS soldiers were trying to 

experime nt or exercise their aim 
at the points and they were shoo
ting at you like to a rabbit.  So 
immediately after being discharged fr om quaran
tine I started working in the washroom.  I was 
so good at folding the SS shirts that they gave me
 the storeroom to take care of, otherwise I had 
to keep every SS guys name s inside my note
book and receiving the di
rty clothes and giving 
them back already washed and cleaned and pr
essed and everything.  So it was pretty good.  
That happened until December 1 of 1943. They 
decided to collect all the Red Point guys and 
put them to bunker.  So I was taken to Block 11
 which was known from t he executions and that 
was the final stage of your -- like the death row or
 the final alley before they executed you.  So 
you imagine how I felt. And that was the time  when new commanding officer ofAuschwitz 

arrive d and this blood thirsty son- of-a-bitch
 was replaced by na me  of Liebehenstetshen 

(probably Arthur Li ebehenschel)
 or some thing like that.  He, 
would you believe, he said that 
during his presence there would be no more ex
ecutions.  So I was saved again but he 
concentrated all these guys who were on the black
 list and he sent us 
to another trip fr om 

Auschwitz to Flossenburg in Bavaria, Germany.  
 
Q: How long were you held in Block 11? 

 

A: From December 1 to February 2. Arriving in 
Flossenburg, here inAuschwitz we had fantastic 
weather. There was no more than about 35, 
38 degrees, no lower, and we arrived to the 
elevation of 900 me ters which is 
over 2700 feet above sea level and 
with six feet of snow on the 
road, cold as hell, and we were only dr
essed in thin German pr isoner uniforms. 
 

Q: They took you by cattle car to Fl ossenburg? 

 

A: Oh yes, the same  thing, and we went thr ough Kemnitz, I remember, station all the way around 
Czechoslovakia. They didn™t go through Czechosl
ovakia, all the way around Czechoslovakia.  
Flossenburg is situated in Northern Bavaria close 
to town ofWe iden and that was -- we didn™t 
know why we are there but we started worki
ng on the Shtassenbau Commando, two mountains 
which we were about to cut to ce rtain level and f
ill the gap in the valley to create a highway. A 
few guys died at that time. We  had two Jewish 
friends, prisoners, with us. They killed one by 

name  of Blum.  He was famous in Jewish societ
y in Poland.  Plus two additional guys that they 

told us they would be transferred to camp wh
ere they have additional Jewi sh prisoners.  In 
Flossenburg we had no Jewish prisoners.  So 
I had, there were ma ny stories I could tell you 
about my presence in Flossenburg camp but that
 was camp t hat I finally transferred to the 

Messerschmitt factory that they ha d in the mountain. We  were not afraid of any air raids or 

anything because it was in the quarry. 
 

Q: Isn™t the salt mi nes? 

 
A: No quarry, gr anite mountains. I was there 
till the end, which means tillApril of 1945. 
 
Q: So most of your time ther e was spent working 
in the Messerschmitt factory?   First you built the 
roads? 
 

A: First we built the roads for the first two w
eeks and then they called all carpenters and good 
thing that I said that I am car
penter.  He look at my hands a
nd he slapped me  and he says you 
son-of-a-bitch, you telling me  that these are carpe
nter ™s  hands and I said well I was a student 
before I was arrested and I didn™t have hard work
 atAuschwitz so I couldn™t  have any calluses 

on my hands, however, I am acquainted with all th
e carpenter ™s  tools.  He says okay then we 
take you but if you show me  any ignorance to ha
ndling the equipment I will kill you personally 
he says. 
 

Q: Is this a kapo or an SS? 

 

A: That was an SS offi cer.  So I was directed 
to the Killer Fur Klidem for Messerschmitt which 
was a small aluminum box that my duty was 
-- it™s on a conveyer -- and I had to make 
approxima tely sixty holes in one mi nute. 
 

Q: You had to drill them in? 

 

A: Drill them in, yeah, through the dzig.  So many 
guys were afraid to br eak the bits.  Once you 
broke the bi t you got 25 lashes.  So I became fa m
ous because I learned how to sharpen the bits 

and to work enough to be allowed to break them
.You had to perform already a certain work 
with every bit before you could break it.  So
 after that on May first 1944 in Flossenburg they 
allowed us to play ball for the first time. 
 
Q: Football? 

 

A: That was like soccer, but only by hands.  Inst
ead of kicking the ball, 
since there was not enough 
room, we also had two goals operating with our
 hands. Would you please believe me  that I 
became a star.  Because of that, I received better 
position to be again in a store issuing the tools 
every morning and collecting them a t  the end of
 each shift. And that was also very good 
because I had one more dish of soup just to 
ma intain my physical strength for the game .  
Germans were betting on me how ma ny goals I w
ill shoot. And we were only allowed to play 
Sunday afternoon. 
 

Q: Did you throw the ball to one another? 

 

A: Yeah, just the same  thing. You operated with
 your hands the same  as your feet and would you 
believe that this is some thing I never expected
 and we had definite knowledge that Germany is 
losing the war because for the first time they allowed us to have some  kind of entertainment.  

Their national holiday, May 1, soci
al what they call MS and they are pair, right?  National 
Socialistice DeutschArbeit Bartai. And from this 
point on it was a little b
it better. They added 
sugar to our morning tea so you can imagine, huh
?   Now two things happened.  First, after 
unfortunate uprising inWa rsaw th
e first prisoners arrived fromWa
rsaw directly to Flossenburg.  
And second thing happened–. 
 

Q: This was after Polish upri sing? 
 
A: Polish uprising, yeah, so in September of–.P
olish uprising wa sAugust 1, 1944 -- in Se ptember 
the first group arrived from the 
uprising, prisoners. And the s
econd thing happened, the plague 
of typhus.  So I experiences I me ntioned to you, red box in Poviak forgot to tell you about fleas 

in hospital inAuschwitz. Tr emendous fleas th
at you could cry because you couldn™t catch them 
and they were biting you all night long.And here 
lice. To receive set of shorts and shirt you had 
to exchange these two items for one portion of
 bread.  Bread was like mone y. You could buy 
anything with portion, daily portion, of the prison
er ™s  daily portion of 
bread.  I tell you what 
value of brea d was, one Komi sbrodt the German 
military shvartz br odt that was simi lar to our 

pumpernickel, you know black pumpernickel, it wa
s also like square, so divided into four 
portions.  One bread was one beautiful white-b
lue diamond, that was th
e corresponding value, 
okay.  So after that I, not only Polish but al
so Czechs and German prisoners were dying.  
Germans in camp were always occupying some  f
unctions whether they we re in charge of the 
barracks or in charge of your work commando or 
whatever.  However there were also Czechs in 
Flossenburg.  InAuschwitz, ma jority were Polish.About 80% were Polish.  Here, however, we 

had about 40% of Czechs, ma ybe 35% of Poles 
and other nationalities, includingAmericans, 
the flyers who were shot down. The y were ther
e but very short period of time and they were 
imme diately executed.  Now to finish my story, 
I was there tillApril 21. We  started moving in 
group of 5000 surrounded by again Ukrainian SS.  
 

Q: You were being ma rched out? 

 

A: Marched out. And they told us they would tr
y to move us south towards Dachau.  But because 

ThirdArmy, we later learned,ThirdAr my was 
moving so fast and they were pushing us 
southeast from Flossenburg and therefore after pa
ssing about sixty miles in
 three days. Out of 
30,000 prisoners they killed 15, 000. Whoever couldn™
t walk they were shot
 in the ditch with 
dum- dum bullets. They were all found after li
beration by theThirdArmy  me mbers, General 
Patton™s army. We  had possibility of getti
ng taken care of imme diate by theAmerican Red 
Cross hospital, field hospital, and I went with my
 friends, tried to go as far a possible west. We  
arrive d to Erlangen near Nuremberg. Erlange
n was not bombed, was academic city with a 
university there.  First camp for re
fugees was formed by the US ar my. 
 
Q: We re you liberated just one morning? 

 

A: Ye s I was liberated on the third day of our ev
acuation ma rch. Wa s a beautiful, beautiful, never 
to forget situation, because we 
were concentrated on the mountain and we have seen on the 
other mountain, we have seen firstAmerican tanks 
and together with us there were Soviet army 
me mbers who jumped on the Ukrainian SS guards. They shot them, killed them instantly and 

with the guns they were started moving toward 
theAmerican troops. Since that was some  kind 
of horseshoe area we were trying to go into
 the valley and then come  up t he mountain and 
ma king ourselves a short cut.And when we were
, we were there three of us, we found a group 
of SS soldiers arme d to their teeth and we almost
 got killed. It™s  unbelievable, right there. You 
sense you had freedom in the air and you could be 
killed at the last mo me nt. That was my 
fourth time when I faced the gun. And good thing 
that my friend spoke German and then we 
said we are Germans from Silesia. We  want to
 go home  now.  So he said only as Germans don™t 
tell them that we are here.  My luck was that 
when I arrived to the first group of theYa nks, the 
commanding officer I think of the fi
rst division of theThirdAr my 
and most of them were Poles 
from Buffalo, NewYork area and almost ever
y second spoke Polish, broken Polish, but they 
knew Polish language.  So I told him in Polish w
ho we me t  on our way here.  So he said okay 
you will see what™s going to happen and they shot
 imme diately first warning like a rocket down 
to the valley.After a few mo me nts lower white flag
 arrived at the ma in building, just like city 
hall or some thing like that and he said look 
what™s gonna happen now. And all these tanks 
ma ybe a doz en of them from all around the area 
they started shooting everything they could 
reach. 
 

Q: So they were  being held in a little town in the valley? 

 

A: Yeah, so finally after that first salvo, finally wh
ite flag appeared on the steeple. And, therefore, 
that was the end of milita
ry action in this area.  So later 
on as I me ntioned to you before, I was 
able to join theAmerican army and after five
 years of serving with 
Labor Service Company I 
arrived to Ne wYork. 
 

Q: So five years employed by the US army? 

 

A: Ye s, from September 1945 to September 1950. 

 

Q: So you were liberated what month? 

 

A: I was liberated in end ofApril,Apri
l 24, 1945 near Ulm very close to the German 
Czechoslovakian border.  I didn™
t tell you ma ny, ma ny details when I was in the bunker.  I was 
facing the experime ntal Block numbe
r 10 to tell you but this is–.. 
 

Q: Do you want to tell me  now or–.? 
 

A: We ll I could me ntion only one detail we were 
witnessing how they took one prisoner and this 
happened to be one of the me mbers of Polis
hVos kafala which was some  ??  hour on Polish 
radio before the war.  He was 
Jewish and he was fantastic come
dian.  He was a star on Polish 
radio before the war.  He was taken one morni
ng to this experime ntal block, Block 10 and they 
removed one testicle from hi m. When he came 
back we ask him what did they do to you.  He 
said that first they had special machine to ej
aculate him when he was normal person with two 
testicles and then after that they remo ved one 
test icle. After three weeks they called him for 
another ejaculation just to comp
are how huma n s perm can work, can be used with one and two.  
With wome n we have seen some thing they were 
working but this will be described in my book. 
 

Q: You were able to see them doing the experime nts? 

 

A: Ye s, before they closed the windows. They 
realized later that we 
were watching, we were 
witnesses, and they bricked up 
the windows.  But for the first 
two weeks of Dece mb er I could 
observe that and after two weeks 
the ma sons blocked the windows. 
 

Q: Wo me n they were doing sim
ilar kinds of experiments? 
 

A: Yeah.
