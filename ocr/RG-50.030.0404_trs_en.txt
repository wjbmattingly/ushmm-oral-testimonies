Answer: Good morning, Joan. 
Q: Welcome . 

A: Thank you. 

Q: Could you tell me  what your name  was when
 you were born?  What your -- the name  that you 

were born with. 

A: Marguerite Glicksma n. 

Q: And you were born with -- 

A: No mi ddle name. 

Q: No mi ddle name?  
A: No. 
Q: Me neither. And where were you born? 

A: In London, England. 

Q: And whe n? 

A: Secrets. 31
st
 of July, 1915. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit about your fami ly. 

A: I had wonderful parents. Dad came  from Po
l a nd, my mother was English, born, and I had two 
brothers, and one sister. Two boys 
and two girls, and we were a very, very happy fa mily. And we 

had a beautiful childhood. 

Q: Tell me  what your dad did and wh
at your -- did your mom work also?

A: No. Mom looked after the kids. Dad was a tailor.
 He came  to England at the age of 14, and he 
always tells us he had half a 
crown and a loaf of bread. He had walked from Poland. He had his 
own business by the time he was 18. He knew an a
unt who was in engl -- in London, so that he 
was able to have some body to go to when he arri
ved. And my mother used to say to him, ﬁPhilip, 

speak Polish to the children, they™ll have other 
languages.ﬂ He would say, ﬁYes, Missus, I will.ﬂ 
Answer in English, of course. And my mother 
had a beautiful voice, and she played the piano, 
and my dad was a smashing looker,
 and ma ny of his lady clients wa
nted to go out with him, and 
occasiona lly he would be out and meet a lady and then some  relative woul d say, Esther, I saw 

Philip with so and so. She would say, yes, but
 he came home  at night. And anyhow, we -- we 
were very, very posey family, we used to do 
most things in the kitchen. One brother was a 
pianist, he became an artist as well, but he couldn™t make a living as a pi anist, but he would be 

sitting at the table doing finger exercises and 
he™d say to me , Marg, what am I playing?  
Sometimes I would guess. My other brother would 
be -- would be dancing with my sister, who 
did ballet, and they™d be pranci
ng around and I™d be rehearsing lines
 for a play. Mother would be 
cooking, Pop would come  and visit and he™d 
take some thing, you know, and that was it. 
Q: So you were a close fa mily? 

A: Very close. 

Q: We re you the youngest? 

A: No, I was the second -- my sister was th
e first, I was the second, then the two boys.  
Q: Wa s your fi -- did your father
 go to war in 1918 -- 1914, or not? 
A: No, but he -- he volunt eered as an ambulance 
driver, and they wouldn™t take him because of 

his nationality. But he did go back to Poland at on
e time to report for duty, and he didn™t stay 
very long. He  wasn™t kicked
 out, everything was fine.

Q: So did he become  a British citizen? 
A: Oh yes, eventually, oh yes. 

Q: But not during that period? 

A: No.  

Q: I see. 

A: Before the second World Wa r. 

Q: What about your education? 

A: A local school for -- from about five to about 
13 - 14, and the school is s
till there a
nd it™s right 
opposite Madame  Tussa ud™s, in London. And it™s attach
ed to a church. This is very interesting 
because although it™s a church school and suppl
emented by the London council and the church, 
they had Hebrew classes in the morning while th
e other girls were having, you know, their Bible, 
or whatever, and we would have Hebr ew classe s.
 And we had a teacher and a headmaster, there 
were three classes. And so I lear
ned a little bit of Hebrew, and of
 course had some  at home , and 
we learned about the various holidays, and holy days. 

Q: W- W- Were you a religious family at all? 

A: Well, my  mother -- until the 
war, my mother kept fairly kosher. I mean, she -- we would 
never have anything that wasn™t, 
and we had blue -- blue-edged clot
hs for the milk and red edged 
ones for the meat, and we had the different thi
ngs. We  didn't have a di
shwasher, Mum was the 
dishwasher. And when war came and we were ra
tioned, there was no way -- she would trade her 
bacon coupons for cheese or eggs or some thing, or 
butter. So we kept as -- but the milk -- milk 
and meat was -- that just went 
by the board because she couldn™t keep it up, it was impossible. 
Q: Ho -- how aware were you of the world when 
you were growing up as a 
teenager?  You were -
- were you keeping -- were you reading the 
newspapers, listening to the radio, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
4 
 
A: Oh yes, and we went over to the continent a 
lot. I mean, at 14 I went
 to Switzerland for two 
weeks with a friend, and one New Year™s Eve with 
another friend, we went to Paris, to -- where 
she had an uncle and aunt. And my sister
 and I would go to the coast of Belgium 
[indecipherable] and all that. And you know, we alwa
ys had a sense of travel. My father, I think, 
was a bit of a Gypsy, he loved to travel, and 
I think I caught -- caught
 the bug from him.  
Q: When the war started -- 

A: Mm-hm -- 

Q: -- in Europe -- 

A: Yes? 

Q: -- did life change ve
ry radically for you? 
A: Not immediately. As I told you, 
I was in the Br itish Red Cross, 
volunteer, and the day that the 
war was declared, a friend who liv
ed up the street was also a me
mber, and I -- she rang me , and 
she said, have you got your uniform on?  And I sa
id yes. She said, do you think we should report 
to the Middlesex Hospital?  And I said, I don™t kn
ow, ma ybe. But I saidle
t™s get together. And 
we did. But that was quite a dramatic mo me nt wh
en Churchill announced that we were at war, 
September the third, 1939, 11 o™clock in the mo
rning. I reme mber it very well. And, you know, 
we sort of plodded along, and until I was eventua
lly called up for real m
ilitary duty, I would go 
twice a week to the Mi ddlesex Hospital emergenc
y, put bandages on and stuff like that, and then 
I would do three nights a week after I worki
ng, and three nights a week I was on duty in the 
underground stations, doling 
out cough me dicine and as
pirin and stuff like that. 
Q: Let™s --  let™s go back a little bit. 

A: Yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404

Q: You were doing -- before the war started, were
 you doing secretarial work, or this was during 
the war?  
A: Yes, oh after school I went to secretaria
l college in London and learned bookkeeping and 
commerce and all that sort of thing, and stenogr
aphy. And I had got a job just before the war 
with a place on Fleet Street. My
 sister was working for a newspaper on Fleet Street, and I was 
working for a supplier of newsprint and all that so
rt of stu -- allied kind of thing. And when the 
big bombing in London started, it was impossibl
e to get to work because there was glass 
everywhere, water, and you couldn™t just go anywhe
re, it was -- and things were burning and that 
really brought the war very close to you. And at that time my  mother was nervous and so she 

went to the country and she took my  younger br
other. She went to Malvern, and she found a 

place to live, and my younger brother, he was 
quite young then, and when he was about 16, he 

became the inspector of weights and measures fo
r the area. And then of course, I was getting 
very agitated because I hadn™t been called up, 
and I was -- I thought, here I am, you know, ready 
to go. Everybody™s going off to war and I™m not? And then I got my pape rs, where did they send 

me ?  To London. And it was to a hospital that was built for Florence Nightingale by Sir Samuel 

Herbert. The hospital was called The Royal Herber t 
Hospital, and very, very old fashioned, but it 
was wonderful, and I was very pleased to be there because on my off duty times I could get 

home  to London and see Dad and my  sister. And 
cousins would come  and pop in. And if there 
was an air raid, we™d all go down 
into the baseme nt and everything would shake and then it was 
okay.  

Q: Could you explain what it means to be a volun
teer in the Red Cross in
 Britain?  What kind of 
training you had, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
6 
 
A: We ll, yes. I joined when I was about 16 or 17 as a junior, and when I was 18 I became a 
senior, and when you were 18 you had to sign a 
paper to say that you would be mobile or 
immobile. If you were immobile, it meant that in
 case of national emergency, you could be used 
from your home  when you had time. If you were m
obile, you were liable to be called up to serve 
with the services, whichever forces, and I had to 
be mobile, so that was why I was called up, it -- 
Q: What does that mean, you have to be? 

A: Well -- 

Q: You wanted to be? 

A: Yes, I wanted to be, very much. 

Q: And wha t  sor -- 

A: I wanted to be wher
e the action wa s, yes.  
Q: And wha t  sort of training, what -- what -- 

A: Oh yes. While we were me mbers, every week
 we would go to classes and lectures and we 
learned how to do first aid. We  even did chemical 
warfare, we had lectures on that, and we also, 
once a year  we would have to go to a military hos
pital and do work in the hospital like a real  
nurse. And we had three days on me dical, three da
ys on surgical and one day in the operating 
theater, so that, you know, we had a good backgr
ound and it wasn™t just bedpans, it was -- and 
ma king beds, it was really in depth work. And we
 were all bright young things and eager to do 
our part, so, you know, it was -- it was 
very interesting 
and rewarding. 
Q: Was it frightening to be in -- 
in London during all these bombings? 
A: We ll, some  nights, you know, when I was goi
ng on duty to one of the underground stations, 
as long as I had my tin hat on and my gas ma s
k, I felt fine. But the shrapnel was going around, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
7 
 
and you know, you just did your thing, and it wa s 
dark, and you couldn™t have a -- a torch -- 
flashlight as they™re called here
. And you just did your thing, you know. 
Q: Were you -- did -- did you ever 
have any close calls, where -- 
A: Yes, but that was when I was at Woolidge, 
when they were doing the bus bombs. I would be 
out with a friend, we™d ma ybe gone for a walk 
some where up the hill, and he would say, wait a 
mi nute, there™s one comi ng, duck. And we™d lie
 down on the ground and we™d count, and then 
you could tell, from the mome nt that the engi
ne stopped, whereabouts it mi ght fall. They were 
the closest calls. But you know, whe n you™re -- wh
en you™re in the thick of things, you don™t -- 
you don™t worry about that. You just car
e about people not getting hurt.  
Q: And were you able to see your mother, did 
you go visit your mother, or was she too far -- 
A: Once, just before I was -- just before embark
ation to go to Italy, which was my next port of 
call, I was given a week™s leave and I went to vi
sit Mum, stayed with her, and then bye-bye, my 
dear, take care, blah, blah, blah, blah, and off 
I went. And that was an experience, because we 
had to meet at a certain station. We ™d alrea
dy been given a clothing allowa nce, and we  had 
equipped ourselves, we had to get battle dress 
and a beret. And we ha
d our outdoor uniforms and 
our indoor uniforms. And we had an allowan
ce for laundry, three and sixpence a week. And you 

know, you had to wear a clean apr
on every day, and they were the 
aprons with the big red cross 
on your bosom, and these caps that
 you floated around with a redcross on the back, and you had 
these big starched tails. Anyway, we  -- we went
 on this tr -- we had no idea where we were 
going, it was all very hush-hush. We  arrived, and we found out it was Li verpool, and fr om there 

we boarded a ship, and the ship I went on wa
s called the Sumeria. 
And everybody name d it the 
Spa meria, cause that™s all the kind of meat we 
had. And we were in convoy, there we re 12 ships. 
And a convoy moves at the rate, at the pace of th
e slowest ship. And of course, going through the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
8 
 
Mediterranean, we had various frights when th
ey were doing these land mi  -- mi nes, you know, 
mi nesweeping. And the noise was deafening, absolu
tely. And then, after 
about 10 days out at 
sea, we were told that if we
 got up at five o™clock the next
 morning, we would see an island 
where a British singer was very famous. And we 
knew that was the Isle of Capri, and Gracie 
Fields, one of the singers of England. And so we
 knew we we re heading 
for Italy, but we thought 
we were going on to India. However, our consignment stopped in Naples, and we were housed in 
a nursing sister™s quarters in Vome ro, which is just
 north of Naples. We  had a nice time  there, we 

weren™t working yet. And there were lots of Am
erican troops there, a
nd they were wonderful. 
They took us to their PX™s or -- or UF -- USO™s,
 and we had our first piece of meat, and we had 
our first orange and our first ba
nana. Things -- and ice cream, which we hadn™t had for three or 
four years. And then they woul
d take us off to dances, which was lovely, and then we went -- 
after a week there we went by hospital train ac
ross Ital y to -- where di
d we land?  Somewhere on 
the other side, and eventually we were stationed in
 Barletta, which is just 
south of Bari, big port, 
and we were with the American fifth army a
nd the British eighth army. They had huge me dical 
facilities and we had prisoners
 of war there, everything. 
Q: The year is what, ™43?  Or later? 

A: Yeah, about ™44, I think, yeah. And from therewe went by -- eight of us were sent up north, 

and we went by ambulances, and dust I have never 
seen the like. We  were covered in dust and 
we would arrive at a different 
town, Forlì or Reggie or anywhere, and when the fellows -- the 
troops heard that we spoke English, oh, the joy. A
nd we eventually arrived in Mestre, which is 
the other side of the Venice cause
way, so that in the evenings af
ter work if we were off, we 
could go into Venice. We™d cadge 
a ride on the trucks, and there 
was nothing to buy in the stores, 
but it was just wonderful. I knew ev
ery little bridge, and every lit
tle church. It was great. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404

then when I finished there, when -- oh, I thi
nk the -- D-Day, and -- and DE day happened while I 
was in Italy. And then I was demobbed in December. 
Q: What does demobbed mean?  

A: Finished, you know, demobbed. De
mobilized. And I went home. 
Q: Wa it a minute, I want to stop you for a mi nute. 

A: Yes, sure. 

Q: Tell me  what it was like when you fir -- in 
London, your first assignment, when you went into 
the military hospitals. 

A: Yes.  

Q: Wa s this very frightening off 
-- I mean, what was it like in -- 
A: It was a bit awe-inspiring. 

Q: How so? 

A: We ll, this huge, big pl ace, and not knowing 
anybody, you go there alone, you didn™t have any 
ma tes. You soon found friends, and your assigned to
 your quarters, and we 
were in a little house 

just outside the hospital which had formerly been 
ma rried quarters. And there were four girls in 

this house. We became very friendly, and the
n, you know, you™re -- you™re a little bit nervous 

because here™s a great wa rd with about 20 
me n in bed, coughing and spitting and -- you know, 
and oh come  here nurse, hold my hand. And then they would want to give you their rations, 

which you couldn™t really take because some  of 
t hem would -- oh, and then we had the TB ward, 
so that was a little bit scary. A
nd then -- oh, eventually I did six 
months in the operating theater 
there, which was really wonderful. Didn™t perf
orm of course, but you know, for some of the 
operations you could hold the retractors and some 
of the casualties were very bad because near -- 
there™ s a famous arsenal at Woolidge, and those civilians were entitled to the military treatment. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
10 
 
So when that place was bombed once, there wa
s a mi ddle aged man who had a terrible stomach 
wound, and I was assigned to help dress 
it. And it was -- you know, you felt you were doing 
something. Oh, I reme mber my first experience,
 I™d only been there a week and a young boy, and 
he happened to be Jewish. He was about 21, 
young soldier and he was having great difficulty 
breathing. And the doctor came up to me  and he 
said, nurse, can you do artificial respiration?  
And I said yes. So he said, well take over fr
om nurse. Nurse was, you know, leaning acro -- on 
the bed, and doing this, and I took over from her.
 And then they said, keep doing it, and if you 
can, don™t give it up, bec -- and while you were
 doing it, you know, the boy was breathing, we™re 
taking him downstairs to the ir
on lung. And we took him downstai
rs to the iron lung, and here™s 
me still pumping away. Got him in the iron lung, a
nd he died the next da y, but his parents had 
arrived, so that ma de me  feel good, and I felt good 
that I had ma -- managed to keep him alive til 
he saw his parents. 

Q: Right. 
A: And that was one of my first experiences. An
d we had a nice group, and there was some  very 
society ladies there. One of them was  a cousin of the queen, Ambose Lyon. And they had two -- 
she had two other friends and we used to call th
em the holy trinity. They 
were always together. 
And of course there was a dramatic society, and I 
had to be in that. So 
we gave little concert 
parties and things in our spare time . 

Q: You sang, or you acted? 

A: Acted. 

Q: You acted, oh. 

A: Yeah. Oh, I don™t have a voice any more. And that
 was nice. And then of course, off to Italy. 
And then from Italy I got home , de mobbed in December -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
11 
 
Q: Now was  it -- let me get -- le
t me  ask you about a little more. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Was Italy different because 
it was almost a hundred -- was it
 a hundred percent military that 
you were dealing with when you were in Italy? 

A: Oh yes, yes, but, I mean, we saw civilians 
and we mi xed with them
, and we learned a few 
words of -- of Italian, of course. We  couldn™t 
help it. And the people were very poor mostly, 
especially down in the south, and these wome
n would come  and they would do your laundry in 
exchange for a bar of chocolate or a piece 
of soap. And you know, you did what you could, and 
was just very interesting. And rewarding. 

Q: Did you like Italy? 

A: Loved it, oh loved it, mm. Bu
t of course, I saw parts that 
tourists don™t go to even now. 
Nobody goes down to Bari and Barletta. And Barle
tta happened to have
 a huge wine growing 
area, and Asti Spumanti was ma de there, which I 
don™t like because I got drunk on it one night at 
a party. Anyhow. 

Q: Did you eat a lot of Italian food, or -- 

A: No, because we were tainted, you see?  We  had British slop in the me  -- from the mess. Very 

unexciting, but substantial and good. I mean, ther
e were no restaurants you could go to anyway. 
You -- you wouldn™t go. And there 
was nothing in the stores to 
buy, even if you had a bit of 
money, you know that?  They had to ha -- had 
to stop ma nufa c turing and ma king, and -- and 
stores were closed. However -- 

Q: W- Was there a lot of devast
ation in Italy that you saw? 
A: Quite a bit, especially on 
our ambulance drive up north, and 
crossing the river Po, which was 
no water, it was just dust, and -- but you c
ouldn™t see too much because you know, you were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
12 
 
with the military and you had to go where you we
re taken, or where -- where they went. But in 
Venice, things were muc h better, and they starte
d opera there, the last 
mo nth I was there, and I 
saw two operas in one of the squares, absolutely
 gorgeous, beautiful. Course, the Italians last 
their operas for hours. They begin at nine and th
en at about 10:30 there™
s a break for two hours. 
Q: Really? 
A: And it doesn™t end til about
 one in the morning, but -- 

Q: It™s beautiful. 

A: Beautiful, beautiful -- 

Q: When [indecipherable] 

A: Anyhow, Greece. 

Q: Right. We -- we™re going to go to Greece in -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- in a few mo me nts.  
A: Okay. 
Q: When did you find out about 
what national socialism, what
 the Nazis had been doing -- 
A: Oh -- 

Q: -- in Europe [indecipherable] the murders?  

A: I knew that before I was -- before I was in th
e forces, because I worked as a volunteer for a 
woman who was a me mber of a -- an organizati
on called the six point group. And they had six 
points of things that they were 
fighting for wome n™s equality. Equa
l ri -- ri -- pay for equal work, 
equal rights, voting, everything. And one of th
e members was Vera Britten, who wrote the 
ﬁTestame nt of Youth,ﬂ which is about [indeci
pherable] as well, and Viscountess Rhonda, and 
this lady for whom I wor ked, her name  was Monica Wa itley. She became an MP for Lime house, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
13 
 
and I learned a lot through her, 
and she used to talk about the 
German people that they were 
bringing over to England, who were trying to getout of that country. So that™s how I fi rst knew 
about it. And of course, you know, there were hints,
 and of course in the 
British -- in the Jewish 
press in England, they we re giving out all the 
details that they coul
d find, but you didn™t know 
how serious it was until 
later in the war.  
Q: Mm-hm. So once you got demobbed -- 

A: Mm-hm, right. 

Q: -- as you say -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- you went back to England -- 

A: I was in England, yes. 

Q: -- and back to your parents? 

A: Yes. 
Q: And so now everybody™s in London again? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Sort of. 

A: Well, my  brother -- my older brother, Robin, 
the doctor, he wasn™t a doctor then, he was 
doing engineering, and because he was in an re
served occupation, he wa s working for Sperry 
gyroscopes or some thing, he couldn™t be released. 
But if he got into an active service they would 
release him. So he got into the air force. And he
 was training for -- to be a pilot, and then he 
came over to Canada for part of the training, whic
h they did, and then came  back to England all 
qualified, but they had so 
ma ny pilots that they put him back
 to Sperry™s for his engineering. 
After the war he went to me dical school and he became a doctor.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404

Q: Mm. So what did you do when you get ba --
 you -- and you -- what 
year did you get back?  
When -- when did you come  back from Italy? 
A: I think it was end of D
ecember, yeah. And I was -- 
Q: ™45?  

A: Yes. And I was mooc hing around for a bit, not 
doing very much. And then
 it was in April that 
I went to Greece. 

Q: And how did -- 

A: And -- 

Q: -- how did it happen that you got to Greece? 

A: Well, because I ran into Amy Zoll. Amy Zoll 
at that time, she wasn™t Gottlieb. And we had 
known each other and she said to me, ﬁOh,ﬂ she 
said, ﬁwhat about comi ng to Greece, we need 
somebody t here.ﬂ I said, ﬁI can™t go to Greece.ﬂ She said, ﬁWell anyway, come up to the 

headquarters of the Joint,ﬂ which are here in L
ondon, and she said, ﬁyou™ll
 me et the lady who is 
in charge .ﬂ When we got there,
 this Dr. Schwartz was there. 
She introduced him and she said, 
ﬁDr. Schwartz, this is Ma rguerite Glicksma n 
and she™s comi ng to Greece with me next week.ﬂ 
And that™s how it all happened, and I thought, well, 
that sounds interestin
g. And then I thought to 
myself, Greece, it™s a different language, it™s a di fferent alphabet, how am I going to get on 

there? Not one word of Greek. So I bought a Greek
 book and I started to l
earn the alphabet. But 
the learned the upper case, capital 
letters. The -- the others just 
flayed me , I couldn™t cope with 
those. But when I got to Greece, I 
was -- I was sent to a hotel, the Grande Bretagne, and shared a 
room with a British gi rl who worked for theembassy. And it was temporary because then you 

could look around and try and find your own place. 
We ll, I was with this girl, and then I was 
invited to Amy™s, and anoth -- the deputy director
, I don™t know if you™ve h
eard of her, she™s no

longer with us, Belle Mazuer. She™s quite a characte
r, and she -- she had been an archaeologist in 
Greece before the war. That™s anot her story. Howe ver, Belle and Amy invited me  to come  to 
their house for dinner. And I said, well how will I findit?  They said, tell the taxi dr iver so and so 

[indecipherable] whatever. And c
ourse I could see signs, I couldn™t read them, I didn™t know. So 
I thought, I™ve got to learn the al
phabet, at least I can read what
™s on the shops and what™s on the 
stores and what the streets are,
 which I did, and I was able to 
cope. And then I was working for 
the director as his secretary, but
 Belle Mazuer asked me  if I 
would do a study of students, and 
that was a wonderful experience. These young me
n, some  had been hidden in the mountains 
while the Germans were invading, some  were retu
rnees, and they had mos tly been towards the 
end of their studies, ready -- almo
st ready to take their degrees
. But they had nothing. Some  of 
them had no fa milies left, some  of them had a bit of fa mily. But they were poor because  

everything they had had been taken away by the 
Greeks. And so what I had to do was interview 

each of these student s, find out what they needed; books, a place to stay, food, etcetera. And 
there were about 22 of them I think I interviewed,and I am still a friend of one or two of them. 
Eventu -- and the students took me  under their wi
ng and I would go to the university dances with 
them occasionally, and we were -- we became good 
friends. One of the boys, he, I™m sorry to say 

died, he became  the head of the -- the Greek railway system, engineering. The other one, who is 

still around, he became a biochemi st, did very well for 
himself. Some  of the others I lost track of. 
Q: Now wha t  -- w-why were you s -- what was the 
point of the study?  In order to then provide 
[indecipherable] 

A: Yes, so that the Joint, the American Joint 
Distribution Committee would be able to help them, 
to find -- to get the books for them, to give them
 food, if needed, parcels of food and clothing if 
they needed it. We  had a big clothing departme nt
. Stacks of clothing were
 sent by the American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
16 
 
Joint to Greece and we had people 
who would sort it, wome n™s, me n™s, children™s, sizing and all 
that, and they could go to this depot and get cl
othes. And one of the -- one of the young me n who 
was working in that, he was what we call pre-TB
. They were borderline TB cases, and we had a 
little sanit -- sanitori
um for these people and they were
 looked after. We ll this young ma n, he 
was cured, and he ma rried one of the girls at the 
girl™s home, that was the fi rst wedding they had 
there. They were able to emigrate to the States 
and they went to Baltimor
e. Very, very wonderful 
thing, when I was in the States 
and I came to visit them, Niko said
 to me , Marguerite, he said, I 
would never have had this in Greece. They 
had a nice little apartm
ent. He said, look, a 
refrigerator. And he said look, 
my ba nkbook, I™ve got some  savings. It was absolutely beautiful. 
Anyhow, unfortunately -- oh he -- he did very well 
in Baltimore, and he, one day in his -- he had 
a store for working me n™s clothes, and one day he 
was shot in the stor e. 
However, he was -- he 
survived. They had two daughters, and he was no 
more, but his wife Renna continued, and why -
- we used to go and see her, but we™ve lost
 touch because she got sick and we couldn™t 
communicate and we™ve lost touch, which is very 
sad. Anyhow, what else can I think of to tell 
you? 
Q: We ll, when you arrived in Greece -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- in ™46. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: What -- y-you -- you imme
diately went to Athe
ns [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, oh yes. 

Q: And wha t  was it like right af
ter the war?  Wa  -- did you see a 
lot of survivors comi ng back?   
A: Well, they were already ther
e when I got there, mostly.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
17 
 
Q: But had Amy cu -- [indecipherable] 
A: Amy was there already -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- she was there be fore me . She only stayed 
a few weeks and then she was off to wherever 
was her next appointme nt. 

Q: I believe it was Austria. 

A: Yes. And my sister we nt to Austria for the Joint. 

Q: So she worked with Amy?  

A: Yes. 

Q: That™s interesting. So were thi
ngs sort of more  norma lized in -- 
A: Yes, and they were -- 

Q: -- Greece when you were there? 

A: And they were getting norma l. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And of c ourse domestically 
there was great differences becau
se in -- I finally found a little 
apartment and there was no stove, they had didn™t ha
ve stoves, they had a little gas ring that you 
could cook on. But this was norma l for all the Greek 
people, that if you want
ed to bake anything, 
you took it to the baker, to the forno, and he 
would tell you what time  to come  and collect it 

when it was ready. Even the rich people didn™t
 have a stove at home , and they didn™t have 
refrigerators. And the iceman would come  and 
you would ask for ice. And I would go to work, 
the ice would be left on the doorstep and I would 
come home to a pool of water. But if I came 
home  early enough, I could put th
e ice in the little icebox. 
Q: Would -- this was your first 
paying job dur -- right after -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
18 
 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- the war, right? 

A: Yes. And -- 

Q: And wha t  -- what -- what was your day 
like?  I mean, you were a [indecipherable] 
A: We ll, we had to be at work 
at eight o™clock in the morning. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And for four days of the week, we left  at
 two. You worked fr om eight until two. One day a 

week you left -- you came  back at five and worked
 til eight in the eveni
ng, and we used to call 
that black Thursday. But when we got home at tw
o, it was so hot in the summer, of course, that 
mostly you™d flop on your bed. You™d have a bite
 to eat and you™d flop, and you™d go into a 
deep, deep sleep. We ll, I was very friendly 
with several of the young me n, one or two who 

worked in the office, and this young doctor I told
 you about. And they would come  back to my 
place because  my apart ment was on a direct line to a big hospital in Athens called the 
Evangelismos Hospital, so I had water every day, 
all the time . Everywhere 
else they would have 
an hour in the morning water, and ma ybe two hour
s in the afternoon. So the boys would come  to 
my place, and they™d all take a shower. And -- you know, I was happy that I was able to do this, 
it was great. And they would bring lunch, they™d
 bring some cold meat and cheese and bread, 
and we™d enjoy ourselves, and we™d all flop. I ha
d a couch in the living room and two couches 
that were used for beds in the bedroom, 
tiny place. And some  would sleep on the floor. 
Some times there were four, some times there were fi
ve, and we would just ma ke the best of -- of 
the situation. And in those days, mo ney was ab
solutely awful. The drachma was just paper, 
worth nothing. And so when you paid rent, it had to
 be paid in gold pounds, so that your money 
was given to you in the office every month, and my
 rent was three gold pounds. Some -- it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
19 
 
English -- gold English sovereigns, that™s it. 
And then they had Swiss gold francs, and I think 
they had French gold francs. But you know, it wa
s strange and you got us
ed to this and you 
thought, well, this is wonder
ful, it™s another country. 
Q: Now these -- these boys th
at you did the survey of -- 
A: Mm-hm, yes. 
Q: -- the students. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Were they all Jewish?  

A: Yes. 

Q: And were they all boys who had 
been in camps, and had come  back? 
A: Some  of them had been in camps and some  
of them had been hidden -- had hidden in the 
mountains when -- you know, when the Germans we
re there. And then, when the civil war 
happened [indecipherabl e] ma ny of them were 
accused of being traito
rs. And I don™t know how 
it happened, but I think in Mats
as™ book, he expl
ains that.  
Q: And were you affected by the civil war? 

A: Yes, because you couldn't travel. The only wa
y you could travel was with a special permit, 
and they had put landmines down in much of the territory towa rds Salonika. And I was in the 

dramatic group, and the general of 
the British army was so impressed with our last play, he said, 
that has to go to the troops in Salonika, can 
you get permission?  So how 
did we get to Salonika?  
The Admi ral™s boat. We  could go by sea up there. 

Q: And wha t  was the -- 

A: That was a wonderful weekend. 

Q: And wha t  was the play? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
20 
 
A: ﬁLaburnum Grove,ﬂ by Priestly. Yeah. And 
it went down very well, everybody enjoyed it. I 
was the mother, and oh yes, for these plays, all th
e office used to come and see them, and all the 
embassy staffs, various countries, would come , a
nd we™d put on a play once every six weeks or 
two weeks. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And was it a full pl ay with staging --  

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- or you did a reading? 

A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: Oh we did it, and we got -- we got ma de
 up costumes and God knows what. There was one 
play called ﬁSaloon Barﬂ and I was a barfly, an 
old lady who was there al
ways, a regular, and it 
was quite funny. And then another one was called ﬁF
lair Path.ﬂ And I remember in that I was a 
cockney woma n with a husband and this Polish 
fellow™s plane had just come  in, and I said 
[indecipherable] I said, did you see his -- his plane, 
it™s got an ‚ole in it.
 Really crazy stuff. 
Q: And you had been doing plays 
as a kid as well, yes?   
A: Oh yes, yes. I was an extrovert, you know. I pr
obably still am, however I 
think I did my bit in 
the war and I did a bit in Greece and I feel 
that I, you know, helped in some small way. 
Q: Did you -- did you do social
 work in Greece at all? 
A: Yes.  

Q: And wha t  was that like?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
21 
 
A: The social work was the student bit, and then
 of course, the helping some  of the people when 
I could, and everybody wanted to le
arn English from me, so that™s
 how I didn't learn Greek. And 
so I would give these little lessons to people, a
nd in any -- in any possibl
e way that you could be 
useful, you were.  
Q: Can you describe some  other ways?  Didn™t you 
hide some -- some  folks during the civil war? 
A: Oh yes, yes. As I said, these fellows who™
d hid in the mountains when the Germans were 
there, they were sought after by th
e military and -- as being traitors
. So several of them -- one of 
the young men was called Alberto Guiladee. And he 
went to Israel and he became a member of 
the governme nt, I forgotten which thing. And then 
there was this Dr. Monaliaruf, and one or two 
others, and they would come  before it got dar
k, come  and visit, and then they would stay 
overnight, and then they would leave when it 
got light in the morn
ing. And as I think I 
mentioned, this apartment was semi -basement 
and the window looked onto the street and you 
could see the legs of people, and 
the lower part of thei
r torsos and we woul
d -- every, about half 
an hour, soldiers would ma rch by. They were in a 
long line, five of them, and they™d have the 
guns, and they would march by, and it was very ominous. But we kept very quiet and we had no 

lights on and they would just pass the wa
y and fortunately nobody was ever caught and nobody 
was ever in danger, really. I was in danger becaus
e if I™d been -- if I™d been found out the Joint 
would have sent me  home too. 

Q: They would have. They -- they -- 

A: They would have, oh yes, you -- you mustn™t 
interfere and you mustn™t do anything that™s 
politically unsound.  

Q: And so why -- 

A: Politically incorrect. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
22 
 
Q: And why did you take that risk, do you think? 
A: Because I liked the people, and because they ha
d to be helped. Some body had to he lp, and if I 
had the means, why not? 

Q: Did other friends of yours, do 
you think, did the same  thing, or  you didn™t talk to each other 
about it?  

A: Oh, we never ti -- never me ntioned it, no, no. Wa s hush-hush. 

Q: And can you describe the different kinds of th
ings that the Joint di
d during the -- you were 
there for four  years -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- that™s a long time. 

A: Yes. Well, I™ll tell you. One of the girl s in th
e girl™s home -- and I saw her when I was back in 
Greece last year, she was a very pretty girl and sh
e had been engaged -- she™d been on the island 
of Crete and she had been engaged to a non-Jewi
sh ma n who had been very much into politics 
and he was anti this, that and the other. And I th
ink he was killed. But she was in Athens and she 
was one of the girls at the girl™s home. She™d 
lost all her fami ly and everything. Her name  was 

Eka. We ll, Eka -- oh, I have to interrupt. At the 
girl™s home -- before the war, Greek girls and 
particularly girls of good fa milies never work
ed, all they did was learn how to do housework, 
cook, embroidery and that was it until they got ma
rried. So that these girls came back and they 
didn™t work, they had no professions. So this wa
s a part of what was done for them by Joint, 
through the National Council of Jewish Wo me n, and 
what™s the other organiza -- ORT, yes. And 
ORT sent sewing machines, and so the girl
s at the home were l
earning to sew and do 
dressmaking and stuff like that. Well, Eka learned 
to sew very well. And they decided that she 
had a flair and that she should go to the home that 
they had in Paris and le
arn haute couture. So, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
23 
 
in order to get Eka to Paris was about six months
 work. And I would go to 
her the -- to the police 
because some body who knew her ex-fiancé had told about
 her, that she must have been a radical. 
And so the -- the passport people wouldn™t give 
her a passport, they wouldn™t give her any 
permission to leave. And I would have to go to -- 
she had to have a representative from the Joint 
to go with her to all these interviews and police th
ings, and so I used to go with her. And finally 

she did get the visa and she did go to Paris and 
she did learn haute cout ure. And when she came 
back, she started a little business on her own, wh
ich was a wonderful thing. And I™m t r ying to 
think what else they did. Course ma ny of the gi rls at the home were adopted by people in Canada 

and in the States, and so they were able to emigra
te and lots of them ca me  over. And this one girl 
I told you about, she™s a cousin of
 Matsas, Nina. Nina had a sister
, they we re both in the girl™s 
home . The sister was younger than Nina and sh
e was adopted by a fami ly in Canada. And so 
Esther came  to Canada where she married and 
had a wonderful fa mily, four lovely children, and 
Nina eventually came  to Canada, but she didn't li
ke it so she went to New York, where some  of 
her other former girl™s home  girls had gone. A
nd so they had a little sort of clubby kind of 
relationship. Nina eventually ma rried and her 
husband knew people in Wa shington and they said, 
why are you staying up there?  Why don™t you come  down he re and we™ll set you up in a 

restaurant?  He knew catering because he™d been 
catering ships. So Nina and this husband came  
down to Wa shington, and I don™t know
 if you ever went there, but
 there was a restaurant in 
Bethesda called The Diplomat. It was on Wi scons
in Avenue, it was wonderful. And then they 
finally retired, and they sold the business. Her 
husband died at the beginning of this year, and 
anyhow, I spoke to Nina and I said, Nina, would you 
be willing to be inte
rviewed if they think 
that you would have a good story?  Sh
e said of course. So anyhow -- 
Q: Did you -- when you me t the -- these people who ca me  back from ca mps or whatever -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
24 
 
A: Yes? 
Q: Did they talk to you about thei
r experiences in the concen -- 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: They did? 

A: Yes, yes. Danny Venami as, whos e book you have, he was -- he worked for us in one of the 

offices, or in the sort -- clothe
s sorting or some thing, and he spoke of his experiences, and Danny 
had a close friend who was with him in the camp
 called Dario. Dario lives in California and 
Dario is some  -- he was in some  films, very
 good looking young ma n, but he and Danny used to 
shovel the remains from t he crematoria. And -- 
you know, it was -- it was 
so heartbreaking to 
hear what they did. And Fofoe, the one who wa
s ma rried in my apartme nt and now lives in 
Spain, in -- yes, near Barcelona, she had some  ve ry
 interesting tales to tell of how they had the sh 
-- the heads shaved, and they -- they were just 
horrified when they looked at each ot her, they 

cried and they laughed, and you know, they were 
hysterical about this. 
And how they shared 
pieces of food. Some body would have a nice pi ece 
of bread and they would divide  it up. Things 
like that. Trying to think. 

Q: What sort of an impa ct did 
that have on you?  Do you remember? 
A: Oh, terrible, terrible. Te
rrible. Give you nightma res. A
nd then you think, well thank God 
they™re here, thank God they™re alive and let™s ho
pe that they can live a normal life now. But I 
must say that most of them don™t bear -- you kno
w, they don™t bear grudges and they don™t -- 
they™re not -- they don™t need tr
eatme nt for psychological things. Th
ey just started to live normal 
lives. Most of -- 

Q: Does that surprise you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
25 
 
A: No. I thought, they™re very good people, they
™re solid. And you know, it 
is -- they weren™t 
given to understand that, you know, they needed to
 see psychiatrists and get over these things, 
they didn™t need it. They ma naged on their 
own and they ma naged very well, I think. 
Q: Marguerite -- 
A: Yes? 

Q: -- through the years as you would re-meet these 
people, do they continue to tell you stories 
about what happened, 
or did it stop? 
A: Oh no. Unless you asked. No, we talked about how
 they were living now and what they were 
doing, and the good times. And that life goes on, a
nd it™s no good dwelling on 
the past, it™s not 
going to help. No, I think there™s a very nice attitude, and I -- I really was -- I mean, it was 

surprising because I know a lot of people who™ve
 suffered, maybe illnesse s and stuff like that, 
and they go on and on and on, and it™s -- it™s ba
d, it doesn™t help them
 and it doesn™t help 
anybody else. Know, when I -- oh, and how the -- 
the people went to Spain. After the war, 
Charles and Fofoe went to Argentina. And I 
don™t know how they ma nage d it, but Charles found 
that he had two brothers who were living in Sp
ain. And you know, in -- in years before the war, 
Jews weren™t in Spain, they™d 
been expelled in 14 - some thing 
and there were no real Jewish 
communities. We ll, he heard that his brothers
 were there and they said, why are you in 
Argentina? Come  to Spain, come  to us, we™ll 
set you up in a business and you™ll be alright. So 
they ma naged to get to Spain and they™re in this
 luv -- they™re outside Ba
rcelona, but I think they 
have an apartment in Barcelona, but they have litt
le stores that sell novel
ties and souvenirs at a 
resort called Lloret de Mar, where I have been 
and visited them. And it™s just wonderful, and as I 

say, after all the experience that poor Fofoe went
 through, she ma naged to have a son. Lovely 
boy, and they have -- he ma rried, and they have
 a little boy who is name d Kavlos. And they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
26 
 
travel a lot when the season is 
over and they can shut shop, they
 go off. And this young couple, 
with their little baby, since he wa
s one, they™ve traveled all over
 the Pacific and Far Ea st. And I 
get cards from them. [coughs] Excuse me . 
Q: Did j -- did the Joint provide a lot of
 people with housing in [indecipherable] 
A: They helped to get houses. Now, Lydia Esca
nazi, who is -- she was Lydia Sabitie, she came -- 
she was hidden, she and her sister Audette, who 
was ma rried to Danny, they were hidden in the 
war. The parents went into the mountains and she was hidden in a baseme nt of some  people, 

some  Greek people. And they were there for si
x months and they never saw daylight. And she 
used to say, when we came -- when there was pe
ace, and we came out of this baseme nt, this 
cellar, she said, we just -- we 
ran. She said, we just ran and ra
n and ran, we didn™t know where 
we were running, but we were absolutely ec static. And anyhow, her parents eventually came 

back. We ll, they had been quite a wealthy famil
y. Her father had been with the Austro-Hellenic 
tobacco company. And so, when the girls were young, they ha d a fräulein, so they spoke 
beautiful German. They went to the Lycée Fran
cais, and they knew French. They also knew 
English, I don™t know how that happened, but they
 spoke beautiful English and Greek, of course. 
Anyway, they -- the family had a house in Athe
ns, it™s 18 Corniavo Street, but the Greeks had 
taken it over and they could not get it back. But fina
lly, with the help of Joint, they were able to 
get one room, and that one room was set up as an
 office, the regional office for the Joint. And 
then, years and years of work and hard labor, they ma naged to get the whole house. And 
fortunately, they had enough money to pull it dow
n and have it built into nice apartments. And 
Lydia and her husband live in that  building in one of the apartmen
ts, they rent the others. Lydia 
had a grandmother called Madame  Faragi. I neve
r me t her, I think she was gone by the time we 
got to Greece. She was very wealthy and she ha
d a house in Salonika. It wa s on the water, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
27 
 
after the war, the royal family used it as thei
r summer palace, and the fami ly couldn™t get the 
house back. But they eventually -- either they go
t compensation for it, which helped a lot -- they 
didn™t get the house, but they got compensation, 
which was better than nothing. And of course, 
Salonika was where the ma in Jewish community
 was before the war, and those Germans had 
desecrated the beautiful cemetery there which wa s on a hill overlooking the sea. And those 
tombstones are used as paving ston
es. Very, very sad. And -- oh yes, when we were in Salonika a 
-- during our play, there was one young girl, Anna Mo
rthul, whom I™d met, and we went with her 
-- we found her and we went and had a meal with
 Anna and her future husband. Anna, I think, 
had also been in camp. I™m not sure, I can™t re
me mber that. And who el
se can I think about?   
Q: I think we  have to take a break now. 

A: Very good.  

Q: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Marguerite, is there -- are there any otherincidents from Gr eece that you think that you reme 
-- remember? 

A: I™m trying hard to bring back some of th
ese wonderful me mories. Let me  think. Well, just 
getting to know the people, the ones that we help
ed, and being taken in as
 part of their fa mily, 
that was a wonderful experience. And I have been
 back to Greece about three times since I me t 
some  of my friends. And Lydia, 
who was the interpreter for our 
office, she always puts on a tea 
and invites as ma ny of -- of the old 
bunch who are still around, to come .  
Q: What do you think was the most difficult thing for 
these folks after the war?
 The fact that they 
had no fa milies -- 

A: Yes. I think that was really terrible. No 
fa milies, and occasionally some of the younger people 
would cry, then they™d get over it. But on the 
whole they behaved amazingly well. They were 
very composed and -- 
Q: We re people ever angry, that you 
reme mber, at what happened, or -- 
A: I never, never saw any real ange
r, never. They were just so tha
nkful to be alive and to be back 
in thei r home area and with fr iends and other people™s families. 
Q: Where they warm with each other? 

A: Yes, particularly. It was a 
very big bond, the girls in the girl
™s home. And it was a wonderful 
thing that the National Council of Jewish women 
did to set up this home because it was a home 
for the girls. They had their room, some  of the m
 shared, and they were all in the same  boat. 
They™d been through a lot and they
™d come  through and they were su
rvivors, really survivors.  
Q: Did most of them want 
to stay in Greece, or not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
29 
 
A: I think they were too young to
 -- to realize whether it was a 
good idea or not. If they had 
found people and got married and settled there, that
 was okay, but ma ny of them were glad to get 
away because  they didn™t have any root any more.  
Q: Wa - Was there training of so
me  kind for -- did ORT train -- 
A: Oh yes, well ORT -- 

Q: -- both boys and girls, or -- 

A: Oh yes. They were trained in dressmakingand I think some  were trained in typing. Not 

shorthand I don™t think, but 
typing. And I don™t know what 
else. Little bookkeeping, too, 
something like that. 

Q: Were there academic courses that they took? 

A: No, not unless they went to un
iversity or school, but they were
 too old for that and not -- not 
really good ma terial for it. 

Q: Did the universi ties open pretty quickly in Greece? 
A: You know, when I got there, 
these students were already -- 
Q: Right.  
A: -- starting back. And they had to, you know, have
 the wherewithal in or
der to continue their 

educations. 

Q: Did you see a big di fference from 1946 til when you left in 1950?  Did things change very 

rapidly, or slow? 

A: Not rapidly, very slowly, but
 gradually the stores were ge
tting me rchandise in. Many of the 
Jewish families there were in the fabric busine
ss, and they were quite wealthy, those people who 
had -- you know, they imported fabrics, a lot 
from England, you know, tweeds for men™s suits. 
And they didn™t have ready-ma de stores, so th
at if you needed any clothes ma de, you had the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
30 
 
dressmaker come  to the house, and she would stay 
-- she™d come  three or four days to ma  -- to 
cut -- to ma ke -- to finish the garments. And 
I had a couple of dresses made that way, and you 
went to this -- the fabr ic place and you chose 
your ma terial and you either drew a design you 
wanted, or you looked in some  books  and they 
did the best they could. And Lydia™s family 

always had a dressmaker comi ng to the house becau
se there were three ladies. Oh, and another 
thing, although I wasn™t wealthy or 
anything and I was just a visitor,
 I had to have a ma id. We  all 
had ma ids. Well, fortunately I was brought up wher
e we had ma ids at home, I mean, they weren't 
uniformed or anything, it wasn™t ﬁUpstairs, 
Downstairs,ﬂ but I was used to having somebody 
around to do things. And my ma ids name  was Sa
lome . She was a very large, round lady. And a 
friend of mi ne had Cleopatra, who was tall a
nd skinny. The name s were 
just hilarious really, 
cause they di dn™t fit the pictur e th
at one had of these characters.  
Q: So you decided to leave in 1950 or
 did the job end in some  way? 
A: We ll, the job ended more or less because th
ey were able to transfer the work to local 
personnel. So why pay foreign personnel larger su
ms  when they could get the people locally to 
carry on. And I was glad really, it was -- it wa
s time for me  to go. And I me an I -- I regretted 
leaving my friends there and ever
ything, but you have to adjust -- 
Q: Right.  

A: -- you know. 

Q: And then you went to England, or -- 

A: I went back to England, yes. And then -- my 
brother had emigrated to the States, arou -- yes, 
and he said, why don™t you come  ove r. And my sist
er, who had finished working in Munich, or 
Vienna, she said, you know what -- we had ma de lo
ts of American friends, because we  -- oh yes, 
this is another thing, we used to have groups of
 Americans from UJA come over to see what was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
31 
 
going on, and then we would be their guides around 
and show them where to have dinner and -- 
and that kind of thing. So we ma de a lot of 
American friends and many of them said, why don™t 
you come  over, you know, we™ll give you a good time,
 etcetera. We ll, my sister and I decided 
that it would be lovely to go to the States. We  c
ould visit relatives that 
we™d discovered there and 
also we could do a tour. And if we got emigratio
n papers, we wouldn™t have
 to hurry and if we 
ran out of cash we could get a job. So we decide
d to do that. And in thos
e days it was easy to get 
a visa. Even -- my sister and I were able to ge
t a visa without having a sponsor, because we had 
enough money to take -- although you weren't allowe
d to bring much money out of England. So 
I went ahead and joined my friend who was living in
 -- she had just moved to the States, living in 
Manhattan, and I joined her and wa
ited for my sister to come  for 
this big tour. She was asked to 
go and help with the reparations -- things in Th
e Hague, so she was delaye
d for six months -- no, 
three months. And by the time she got there, I had 
run out of cash and had to get a job. I also wan 
-- didn™t want to stay at my friend™s house any lo
nger, it was not right. So I had found an English 
girl and we collaborated and we shared an apar
tment, but I had signed the lease and it was two 
year lease and I couldn™t get out of
 it. So when my sister arrived she took off and ha d a holiday 
in Mexico and when she came back we -- you know, 
it was too late to star
t our trip, so we got 
jobs. And then in 1956, we decided we would go back
 to England and see if 
we could stay there, 
or if we didn't like it we could come  back to 
the States. We  got to England, we had a very good 
year doing practically nothing 
but visiting and enjoying ourselv
es. And then in 1957 we were 
asked to go to Vienna because of the Hungarian 
uprising and they needed people in Vienna to 
help. So, both Leba and I went to Vienna. I stay
ed for a year, but after three months Leba was 
asked if she would go back to London because 
there was trouble in Egypt and they needed 
some body i n London to help with th
e Egyptian immigration. So --

Q: And who were you hired by, Joint again? 
A: Joint, yes. 

Q: Did you work for the Joint in New York? 

A: No, no, only in Europe . And because we were
 from England, we got a British salary. We  
didn™t know the difference, so that we didn't get 
very much money, but it was adequate. I me an, 

it was a nice job. 

Q: Right. 

A: And that was secondary to the work. 

Q: And the work was important because you were -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- you were doing again what you had done. 

A: Yes, yes, it was very important. 

Q: And then what -- then what happened, then
 you came back to England or you came to the 
States again? 

A: We ll, we had to get back to 
the States or we would have lo
st our re-entry permits. You™re 
allowed one year and 11 months, and then you 
-- either you do or you don™t. And we decided 
well, we™ll come  back because by that time my br
other had se ttled in Alexandria. He™d opened a 
practice there, and so we came. He sa id, you come
 and you can get jobs in
 Wa shington and it™s 
very nice, and you can st ay with us until -- so 
we  came and after about three months -- oh, we 
stayed with Robin for a week or so and then we 
found an apartment in -- th
at™s another story -- in 
Washington, and then my brother moved down to 
Petersburg, Virginia, so there we were. We  
found a wonderful sublet apartment in Wa shington
 and became very, very friendly with the lady 
who sublet it to us and her family. And although sh
e and her sister and all 
that have gone, I still 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
33 
 
am very, very friendly with and fond of the da
ughter, who now lives in Wi nston-Salem. That™s 
another of my travels. 

Q: Right. And so you™ve been here
 in Wa shington ever since? 
A: Yes, yes. But not -- we ™ve only been 20 
years in this --  in this apartment. 
Q: Right. 

A: We  lived further up 16
th
 St reet  for whi l e . 
Q: And wha t  did you do when you started wo
rking in Wa shington, once you came back? 

A: Oh, I worked temporarily for 
a little while and then I got a 
job with a law fir m, you ma y have 
heard of it, Arnold and Porter. It
 was wonderful when I first join
ed, it was just -- those -- it was 
Arnold, Fortis and Porter, and those three were 
the most brilliant, wonderful me n, absolutely 
terrific. And then, of course, it spread like Tops
y, and it™s now like a comm
ercial place, it™s too 
big. But it moved three time s from the little house we had on 19
th
 Street. 
Q: Hm. 
A: Yep. 
Q: Well, I want to thank you so much 
for talking with me . [indecipherable] 
A: We ll thank you for listening to my stories. 

Q: We ll, and what I™d like us to do -- 

A: Yes? 

Q: -- we™ll st op the came ra for a mo ment -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- and then we™ll st art showing some  of th
e photographs and you will tell us what we™re going 
to see. 

A: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
34 
 
Q: Okay?  
A: Very -- 

Q: And who do we have here? 

A: This is a portrait of Amy Zoll, who becam
e Amy Zoll Gottlieb, when she was working in 
Greece. 

Q: About what year? 

A: And it was through Amy that I went to Greece. 

Q: Do you know about what year 
that mi ght be, the picture? 
A: It must be soon after I arrived 
in Greece, which was 1940 -- was it ™46?  
Q: I don™t know, you have down here the last -- 

A: April ™46. 

Q: -- look at Greece, underneath her photograph. 

A: Oh, well she was ready to leave, you see. 
Q: So it mus t  have been ™46. 
A: ™46 yes. It was about two -- about
 a month afte r I 
got there. Wa  -- 
Q: And who is this group? 

A: These are colleagues of mi ne. The gentlema
n on the far right was Alberto Guiladee. He, I 
think had -- yes, he had been in one of the camps
. He later went to Israel and became  a me mber 
of the Israeli governme nt. He ma rried a New Zeal
and girl. The next person is Dario Ga bi, who 
also had been in camp. The next one with
 glasses is Mario Montiano, who became  a 
correspondent for The London Time s and The Kemsle
y Press. The next one is yours truly. The 
next one is Dr. Manoli Aruch, and 
the next one is a Greek girl called El li, I don™t know her last 
name , she married a friend of mi ne. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
35 
 
Q: And the date? 
A: And the date was about 1947.  

Q: [indecipherable] Okay, go ahead. 

A: This was at a party and we were asked to 
come  in costume , and we ma naged to get some  
Greek evzone outfits, and the gentlema n on my le
ft is -- he was born in Ca iro, he ma rried a 
Greek girl and they settled in England. He 
had British na tionality because Egypt, you know, was 
British in those days. The other chap was a fr iend of Bill™s, and his name was Vasili so mething 

or other, and he was in the 
British army. How, I don™t know. 
Q: What™s going on here? 

A: This was taken at the girl™s home, whic
h was started by the National Council of Jewish 

Women of America. And the -- the 
directress is in the picture, I 
think, and some  of the girls who 
were returnees from DP camps, and 
some of the -- I think one or tw
o of the fellows were -- were 
hidden in the mountains duri
ng the invasion of -- 
of the Greeks -- of the Ge rmans.  
Q: And this was 1947?  That™s what 
it says in your [indecipherable] 
A: Probably, mm. 

Q: In Athens? 

A: Yes. Okay. 

Q: That™s alright, we™re set now, go ahead. 

A: Right. Occasiona lly we were ve
ry fortunate in being able to send some of our Jewish people 
to Israel, and this is a group w
ho we re able to go to Israel. 
Q: There anyone in particular you 
would identify there, or not? 
A: I -- I don™t think I know -- ex
cept at the bottom right hand co
rner is Harold Goldfarb, who 
was the director in Greece for the AJ DC. And 
he was there to see them off at the dock. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404

Q: 1948? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: That™s the gentlema n down here? 

A: Yes. On one of my vacations
, I teamed up with a girl from 
the British embassy and we did a 
little cruise around the Aegean w
ith a special stop in Alexandria for five days. And while in 
Alexandria, we were able to 
visit the sphinx and the pyramids,
 and as you see, we met the 
livestock and we were the only people around the s
phinx and pyramids, there were no tourists in 
those days. And this was a professional picture b
ecause our cameras were confiscated at the dock 
and we couldn™t take pictures. But we  traveled by
 train from Alexandria 
to Cairo, and in Cairo, 
the gentleman you™ve seen in other pictures, Bi
ll Brudo, he was in the evzone costume, his 

parents were still living in E
gypt and we were able to vis
it them, and that was quite an 
experience, to see a home in Egypt, it was great.
 And they had the ma nservant with the white 
robe thing on and the fez, serv
ing the cold drinks. Wonderful. 
Q: And this is 1948? 

A: Yes.  

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: In Greece, the house is a spee
ty, and if it™s my house, you tack
 on the my at the end of the 
word, so that was speetymou, my house. And it was 
sort of semi -baseme nt, tiny little place, and 
it was lovely. It was very, very nice. Sparsely 
furnished. In Gr eece they didn™t have carpeting on 
the floors, they were ma rble floors or stone fl
oors and in the winter you™d put down a rug. In the 
summer, out with the rug. And as you see the wi
ndow at the side, behind me , that™s where we 
could see the soldiers ma rching. You just -- ma
ybe in another one you can see that, but that™s 
how it was, you see, the window was half way up the s -- up the street. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
37 
 
Q: Opposite -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: So there™s the window. 

A: Yeah. The door is where my hand is. 

Q: Right. 

A: And you went down two steps for it, so it was not
 really a baseme nt, it wa
s just a little below 
street level. 

Q: Okay, go ahead.  

A: Okay. We had some  very happy occasions and 
one of them was when my dear friends Fofoe 
and Charles were married, and they were married in
 my little apartment. And this is some of the 
wedding guests. Celia Bl oom of the National Council 
of Jewish Wo me n i s  there with her lovely 
hat. The director is over by -- by the wall above, 
and other guests and friends. That was a very 
lovely occasion. 
Q: And that was 1949? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Go ahead.  

A: Here is the rabbi performi ng the service.  

Q: And who is the woma n on the left of the couple? 

A: Oh, that™s Celia Bloom, the directress of the girl™s home. And the ma n on the right of the 

groom is Dr. Manoli Aruch, who was the best 
ma n. And you wo -- just see the chuppah over the 
top. Interior of speetymou. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Very sparsely furnished, but very cozy. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0404  
38 
 
Q: Fresh flowers? 
A: Oh yes. Probably sent by a boyfriend, I hope.  

Q: That™s okay? 

A: Yeah. Another corner of speetymou. The ga
dget on top of the cupboard is a radio, not a 
television set. They didn™t 
have them in those days. 

Q: Wa s it shortwave so you could 
listen to BBC?  You don™t reme mber? 
A: As they say in Greek [indeciphe
rable]. I don™t know. Has lots of knobs. 
Q: Yeah.
