LUCIE STERNBERG ROSENBERG 
 September 24, 2002 
 
Q: Goodmorning. 
 

A: Goodmorning. 

 

Q: Thank you for agreeing to the interview. 

 

A: I™m very pleased, Joan, that you–This is 
the first time I™m doing anything like this. 
 

Q: So, first tell me  where you were born. 

 

A: I was born in Zagreb. At that time, it was 
the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, 
later became Yugoslavia. It™s Croa tia now.  
 

Q: And what year were you born? 

 

A: I was born in 1921, December fifth. 

 

Q: Decemberfi fth? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: 1921?  And, what was your name  
when you were born, your full name ? 
 
A: Officially, you know, in the documents, I 
was Ca rolina Sternberg, but I was always 
known as Lucie, L-u-c-i-e C-a-r-o-l-i-n-e, a
nd that was never used except on docume nts. 
 

Q: And your name  now?  

 

A: LucieCarolRosenberg. 

 

Q: Rosenberg. Now, I want us to get some
 sense of what your life was like in your 
childhood. So, perhaps you can start with your 
parents, or you can start where you would 
like. 
 

A: My father™s name was Manfred Sternberg. My
 mother™s name was Lili. Her ma iden name  
was Prister, P-r-i-s-t-e-r. He
 was from Slavonska Pozega, which was a rural part of 
Croatia, and my mother was from Za greb and 
her fa mily was an old Zagreb fa mily that 
had originally come  from what is now Italy a
nd is the extreme border that really is on the 
other side of Radiska and Ach
ilea (ph), and places like that. 
 

Q: And, your mother™s fami ly was a fairly wealthy fa mily? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471

A: They were a wealthy family.  
 

Q: And, what did her father do? 

 

A: Her father was an architect and actually 
did all sorts of buildin
g both for the Œ some  
private buildings, but he did a 
lot of Œ for instance, he was building docks in Fiume at the 
time, and various Œ I think ma ybe some  public 
buildings of one kind or another. I don™t 

think that he was a particularly
 inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day 
architect who always kept his profession, wh
ereas the rest of his family was spending 
money like crazy and ended up paupers, ma ny of
 them, after spending money like mad in 
one direction or another. He was always working. 
 

Q: And what was your father doing? 

 

A: My father was an industrialist. I think mos
tly agricultural. Croatia obviously was a very 
agricult Œ mostly, 80 percent ag
ricultural country, and he 
had alcohol Œ and he had an 
alcohol yeast factory which was a very large on
e, and probably the larg
est in that part of 
Croatia, and a number of other agri
cultural refineries and so on. 
 

Q: Since I™m ignorant, what does it mean to ha
ve an alcohol yeast f
actory?  What is that? 
 

A: Well, yeast obviously, you know, is ma de - these we were almost monopolies because 
there were certain ones, I mean, not ma ny pe
opl e were producing yeast for ma king bread. 

Agricultural alcohol means that they woul
d take beets, you know, various corn, for 
instance, and so on, and it would be refined 
as alcohol. And for a while, as a ma tter for 

fact, in Croatia, there was a law where you ha
d to mi x alcohol with gasoline, which is 
what they™re doing here now, and this was al
ways very protected because there were 
huge, huge taxes otherwise. But being as it was 
agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff 
was protected by the government because it wa
s sort of beneficial to the state or 

whatever, or the peasantry or whatever. So, 
obviously there were lots of land where some  
of this raw ma terial was produced, but also 
was bought from the peas
ants as needed. The 
yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on. 
 

Q: So, you were born into a very privileged life? 

 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: So, tell me  about Œ like, let me  first ask you, what is your clearest me mory of your 
mother?  Wh en you were little, when you were a young person? 
 

A: A very sweet lady getting dre
ssed to go out some where elegantly. 
 

Q: So, they were very social? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
3 
 
A: They were very social, but everybody wa
s this wa y, young people, and it was a social 
town, and it was a fairly small group, tota
lly mi xed Œ both Jewish and non-Jewish 
population. 
 
Q: Now, were you taken care of pr
imarily by governesses at this time? 
 

A: Yes, but my mother supervised. One of my
 very early me mories was of a German nur se 
with a Œ who were dressed like nuns, and had th
is long veil. They were special children™s 
nurses. And she was unusually unpleasant, and pu
t me apparently into a dark room, and I 

do reme mbe r  that, and the cook saved Œ me  
upstairs, started screaming and the woma n 
was let go immediately, and then there was, 
I guess, when my brother was born, there 
was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother™s ma ybe five, this wa s there. Then I 

got an English governess, Miss– her name  wa
s – because the second one Œ the first one 
was called Miss ﬁMees Smeesﬂ Œ Miss Smith 
Œ she was known ﬁMees Smeesﬂ, who was 
with us for ma ybe six months. My brothe
r was throwing tantrums and Œ because he 
couldn™t stand her, and then the nanny came back
 for Œ and stayed forever as part of the 
household. And then there was a Swiss pers
on who was quite unpleasant for about six 
months, and then my real English governe
ss who stayed for years, whose name  was 

Agnes Coyne. And there, there was some thi
ng kind of a musing about her because when 
King Alexander was killed. There wa s a– 
 

Q: That was in ™28? 

 

A: No, I think ma ybe ™34, ™34. There was a re
ge ncy for med because Peter was too young to 
govern and one of the Œ I mean, the main me
mber of this, of this regency was King 
Alexander™s cousin, Prince Pa
ul, and two other persons Œ 
one was a Slovene and the 
other was a guy buy name  of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian 
ban
, which was sort of 

like a governor of a state. He had three childre
n and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved 
back to Œ then they moved to Belgrade, and th
ey decided they absolutely had to have our 
governess, and contacted her and contacted 
my mother, andthey 
wanted Œ she didn™t 
want to go. And my mother said, ﬁYou absolu
tely have to go because we would have 
sanctions against us left 
and right. You can™t say no.ﬂ
 And finally she went, but 
apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us
 practically every week, and one day 

appeared at our doorstep with
 her suitcases and my mother had to ma ke up some  big 
story about her being sick, 
having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on, 
and she stayed until I guess I was 16. 
 

Q: Where did you eat dinner?  Did you 
eat with your parents? Did you eat - 
 

A: Lunch– The ma in meal was at noon, and the 
governess and my brother and I sat at the 
table with them, and in the evening we 
sat with them when had dinner with the 
governess. 
 

Q: So, do you reme mber conversations around the 
table?  We re they very inquisitive about 
what you had done during the day?  Or
 was this a very adult meal? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
4 
 
A: Both. 
 

Q: Both? 

 

A: Both, but yes, of course, because we ofte
n didn™t have school at the same time. Schools 
were Œ school days were three days in the 
morning, three days in the afternoon from eight 
to one, quarter to one, some thing like that, a
nd then afterwards we
 would have private 
classes of one kind or another at home in Ge
rman, French, this and that. And, my brother 
ma y have gone Œ he did not go to the same  
school as I did, but I™m a little Œ I™m already 
high school. I™ll go back, if you want, to, to prima r y school. 
 

Q: He™s three years younger. 

 

A: Three years younger, three years younger, y
eah. And so I™m not quite sure whether Œ I 
think I™m talking now mostly is-is alrea
dy in secondary school. Yeah, because, but 
otherwise, yeah, we ate at the tabl
e. This was mo stly for discipline. 
 

Q: In what way? 

 

A: Well, you know, you sit around and slop around in 
sort of a children™s room, it™s different 
than when you™re sitting at th
e table with a meal that wa
s served with white gloves. 
 

Q: So, there were people there who 
were serving with white gloves? 
 

A: Oh,yeah. 

 
Q: So, did that mean you ha ve to be very prim and proper, as well? 
 

A: Yes. We ll, no, listen, because she took o
ff her gloves and we palled around afterwards, 
but, yeah, it was quite formal. It was quite formal. 
 

Q: Were your parent warm t o you?  We re they affectionate? 

 

A: Yes. Yes, but also qu
ite disciplinarian, both, yeah. 
 

Q: Were you close with your brother even though he was–? 

 

A: Yes, yes. I mean, as mu ch as you™re cl
ose with a boy who™s three years younger than you. 
You despise them mostly, but yes. 
 

Q: And the friends that you had, were the 
ma ny school chums that you had, or were–? 
 

A: First of all cousins. 

 

Q: Lots of cousins? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
5 
 
A: Not many, one cousin who is Mia Bauer (p
h), who is two and a half younger Œ two and a 
half years younger than me . There was anothe
r one who died who was also three years 
younger, and then there were extended fa mily 
Œ cousins who were about Œ but he was the 
oldest, except for two cousins who were from 
out of town, and then later on Œ it wasn™t a 
very large family. And the Pristers al l lived apar
t, so this was mostly Sternberg part of the 
fa mily. Although there was one cousin of the 
younger ones of the sisters that would have 
been Œ who was about my age, ma ybe a y
ear younger or so. Yes, they were very 
affectionate; yes they were strict as fa r as
 school work is concerned, as far as ma nners 
were concerned, as far as - 
 

Q: Did you like school? 

 

A: Yes, I did. Although, I wasn™t a 
particularly good 
student at it. 
 

Q: And, the private lessons that 
you had at home, what were they? 
 

A: French, later on. Some times if I was n™t 
doing too well in any subjects, some body would 
come  and we would work on the Latin and so on. Then I would go out for gym of one 

kind or another, tap dancing. 
 

Q: Tapdancing? 

 

A: Tap dancing at the time of Shirley Te mple, 
I guess, it was the rage. But that was outside. 
I mean, that wasn™t at home. 
 

Q: Did you ever tap dance at home once you got back? 
 
A: Mildly, yes. Yes, I was not particularly good at it. 

 

Q: Go ahead, I™m sorry. 

 

A: Also, there were gym classes of other kinds. 
Now, this is kind of interesting. My brother 
went to the Maccabi, as most Jewish kids did, 
but I went first to the Sokol. The Sokol is a 
pan-Slavistic Œ pan-Slavic gym organization an
d also, I guess, pan-national, pan-Sl avistic 
nationalistic organization, that 
had a lot of calisthenic-type 
things, and I went to that 
which took place Œ I can™t remember  Œ in so
me Œ there was a thing, yes, they had a 

particular hall in town which was called a S
okolan (ph), and there were dances there as a 
ma tter of fac t  and so on. And, some where in 
the early ™30s, maybe ™32 and so on, they 

had Œ there were things like the Olympics but
 only Slavic. So, they would come  and, I 
mean, I never traveled out of Zagreb for 
it, but I reme mber there was a very large 
gathering and people came  from Cz echosl
ovakia and Bulgaria and Poland and who 
knows what, and there was this ma rch and we  did calisthenics and we did, you know, like 

the Germans did and so on. There™s these horrend
ous things in stadiums  and in fact there 
was a stadium built at the time for this particul
ar get together. And then later when I was 
about 12, again, my brother and others in the family were in the Maccabi , I was a 

me mber of the 
HASK
, which was the Crotian academic sports club, 
Hrvatski akademski 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
6 
 
sportski klub
, which still exists. It was a big socce
r club and gym, and I did Œ what was 
it?  Œ track, I ran marathons a
nd that kind of thing. It wa
s short ma rathons, and trained 
with it, and stuff like that . 
 

Q: So, was your fa mily very Jewish identifie
d in terms of the synagogue, or was this in 
terms of soc i al groups more? 
 

A: My Œ they were obviously me mbers of the 
synagogue. In fact, my mother had a plaque 
on, you know, a seat in the synagogue and so on, 
and they went for, I guess, Yom Kippur 
and the ma jor holidays. We were required 
to go, both in public high school and so on, on 

Saturday to children services in the s
ynagogue. And it counted Œ you had to have an 
excuse from the rabb
i if you didn™t attend.  
 

Q: So, this is nationally required. 

 

A: This was nationally required as the Se
rbs and as the Œ the Serb Orthodox Œ and the 
Catholic kids had to go to services. This 
was not all the time , but there was ma ybe a 
period of three, four years where this was r
eally seriously required. And we had religious 
classes both in public high school and obviously
 in the Jewish school where I went Œ I 
went to four years to the elementary school, 
to the Jewish school, where we learned both 
biblical Hebrew and then later on modern He
brew, and sang various things and so on. So, 
it was quite interesting as far as that™s con
cerned. And, once Œ and then, during that, as I 
said, during the ma jor holidays, the parents 
went and we went to the synagogue, which 
was just around the corner from town. 
 

Q: Did you celebrate holidays at home as well? 
 
A: There was a Challah loaf. 

 

Q: OnFridays? 

 

A: No, not on Fridays, on holidays. And for Passover we were usually farmed out to people 
who knew how to do this better, or well, 
anyhow Œ we went to that and then for 
Hannukah, there was a candles and - 
 

Q: What would you call the fa
mily?  Certainly not orthodox. 
 

A: No– 

 

Q: But traditional or somewhat observant? 

 

A: Traditional. 

 

Q: Traditional? 

 

A: There were some  Œ I me an, yeah. I suppose so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471

Q: It sounds like, from what you™re saying, 
that you didn™t experience anti-Semitism as you 
a kid growing up. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: That you were integrated in the community. 

 

A: Completely. 

 

Q: And do you think this wa s true of the Jewi
sh population in Zagreb
 and in Croatia in 
general?  
 

A: I think so. I think so. Yes. 

 

Q: So, you think so. 

 

A: Yes. Pretty much so. 

 

Q: It was very different from a lot of peopl
e™s experiences in eastern Europe and central 
Europe. 
 

A: Totally, totally. I™m not ta
lking only about Zagreb, but 
for instance, my fa ther in 
Slavonska Pozega, his father and the priest 
of the one leading c
hurch there, obviously 
Roma n Catholic, used to play cards together
 daily, and so on. Totally. Not only that, but 
my aunt was Œ this was the one that was a fe
w years younger than my fa ther Œ was sent to 
Ljubljana to a Malud, I mean, there was a 
school with was run by nuns, a boarding school 
run by nuns, which is where she sort of went to
 finishing school at age 14. She hated it, 
but that™s where she went, fini
shing school I guess in German. 
 

Q: Did you see movies as a kid? 

 

A: Yes,sure. 

 

Q: What did you like?  Do you reme mbe r? 

 

A: Oh, yeah. Clark Gable movies. A lot of 
Ger man movies, of course, until the time came 
when we didn™t go to any German movies. It
 happened Œ what was it that wa s this 
wonderful Clark Gable movie where they were 
on a train?  I forget the name  of it. ﬁIt 
Happened One Nightﬂ?  Yes. That was one I remember. 
 

Q: It™s always odd when I hear people 
from Europe talking a
bout American movies. 
 

A: Yes, that was one of them. ﬁGone with th
e Wi ndﬂ, I think. Any possible Shirley Temple 
movie that came  around.

Q: Were these subtitled? 
 

A: There was subtitles. 

 

Q: But you understood? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah, sure, but
 ther e were subtitles. 
 

Q: And were you fluent in English? 

 

A: Completely. 

 

Q: Completely? 

 

A: Yeah. The first governess was when I was seven, Mees Smee s. 

 

Q: Mees Smees, yes. Culturally, what did you do?  Di d you go to concerts? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you go to museums? 

 

A: We went to concerts, which were quite fr
equent and good mu sical life there. They had Œ 
my grandmother had a loge in 
the opera in the national theater with her name on it. So, I 

had to go to whatever was appropriate for ch
ildren, ballet and so on. There was very nice 
Œ there was student, afternoon st
udent performa nces with the 
school at a very low price, 
and you stood in the back if you had to, and that was permitted. I was always very 

pleased to do that. My grandmother had a s
ubscription to various concerts which took 
place. And the theater of all ki nds. The older Œ the parent s, the grandmother and 

grandfather Œ went to Vienna every season to
 get clothes because we
 couldn™t in Zagreb, 
to have them ma de, and to the opera especi
ally. My grandmother on my father™s side 
remarried. She was a widow. She was married, 
and her husband was a Croatian Jew, but 
he was bank director in Vie
nna, and she was Œ she loved be
ing a Croatian
, a provincial 
lady, and she actually brought to Vienna a Croa
t room, a folk room, like a peasant room. 
She went so far as to bring the wood paneling, 
cut out the way that they do in CroatiaŒ a 
peasant room with peasant furniture, peasan
t dolls, stuff like that, which was kind of 
amusing, but she lived there so then from the 
time I was ma ybe a year old or so. She died 
when I was five, but I reme mber going visiti
ng there and obviously, my mother and her 

mother used to go every season to Vienna
, once a year at least, probably twice. 
 

Q: I™m going to ask you about going to England Œ 
but I want to ask you to sort of reflect 
those years. Do you have any fond memories 
of your childhood or is it ambivalent? 
 

A: Ambivalent in ma ny wa ys. 

 

Q: Can you explain that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
9 
 
 
A: Yes, I would™ve loved to have been Œ I di
d, I was permitted fr om time to time to ride the 
trolley to school, but mo stly I walked because 
that was healthy, but if I ha d been sick and 
the weather was dreadful, I w
ould be driven to school, but the car was neve r permitted to 
stop there. I would emer ge behind the corner. 
 

Q: Was that so the people wouldn™
t see that you had been driven? 
 

A: I didn™t want it, and it would have been show
-off. It would™ve been immo dest for a little 
girl to be driven. 
 

Q: So, you, yourself rema in ambivalent a
bout the kind of privilege you lived in. 

 

A: Yes, yes. It was Œ there were a numbe
r of well-off fa milies, obviously, but it was 
uncomfortable because the schools were to
tally mi xed. You had children who were 
poverty stricken, who got free milk both at th
e Jewish school and in high school, I me an, 
in secondary school, and it was embarrassing. 
It wa s embarrassing when the governess 
would pick me  up. I didn™t like that. Alt
hough, oddly, I was with a friend two years ago, 

last year, two years ago in Zagreb who re
me mber ed how disgusted Pippsi was Œ Agnes 
Coyne, we called her Pippsi. She said, ﬁNo, 
she was wonderful.ﬂ I said, ﬁHow can you 
say that?  She was a horrible woma n.ﬂ ﬁNo, no, 
she was always very nice to me .ﬂ You 
know, it was Œ you™re right, it was unpleasant.
 And when you walked home, if you were 
picked up with friends, everybody, you know, 
reported back to one™s mother how you Œ 

whether you greeted them prope
rly, whether you curtsied, we 
curtsi ed. Still, I curtsied 
when I came to the States to married women always. 
 
Q: Really? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: So, you were taught to curtsy to- 

 

A: Older wome n, yeah.  

 

Q: Did it ma ke it difficult for you to ma ke friends because of your - 

 

A: No,no. 

 

Q: Itdidn™t? 

 

A: No, I had lots of friends, very good friends in
 all strata, absolutely 
all strata. They would 
come to me. I would come to
 the m Œ not a problem and 
not as far as religion was 
concerned or anything else, no, not at all. 
 

Q: We™re going to stop.

Q: Let™s talk a little bit a
bout your political consciousness 
before you leave for England. 
 

A: Absolutely. 

 

Q: And you go to England in 1937. 

 

A: Right.Right. 

 

Q: Are you very politically conscious? 

 

A: Yes, and I was fairly Croatian Œ well, firs
t I was very Yugoslav. And then I become  quite 
Croatian be cause they Œ mostly because, pr
obably because the pressure from Belgrade 
was really quite bad. You felt 
it and everyday life. In fact, 
if you look at a certificate, 
school certificate from a pub
lic school in Zagreb, it was 
supposed to be in the two 
languages. So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Se
rbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin 

script. It went that far. There was a lot of
 indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. I guess 
you just become  Œ ma ny of our
 friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were 
mostly nice and decent and I don™t think Œ they
 ma y have been anti-Semitic, but certainly 
not overtly so. I don™t know, ma
ybe some  were. Some  were, on 
the contrary, very less so. 
And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very Œ had friends of all 

kinds. During King Alexander, and later on act
ually, even Pr ince Paul™s regime  and the 
various Serbian Œ especially af
ter the death of Alexander, th
ere was a lot of repression, 
and one of the me mbers of my extended fa
mily was a young ma n who was a communist. 
He was in the same  jail as Mose Pijade, and 
he was killed in the war. There was a whole 
group of young Communist activists, 
leftists, all of th
em, of c ourse, very idealistic, had 
no idea what it really me ant, and who sat in
 jail. And my unc le, who was a lawyer, was 
the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, a nd so on. They were in very, 

very notorious political prisons. One of them
 is Lepoglava where th
ey continued giving, 
you know, that was also later 
on in jail during the Ustashe regime  and so on. So, there 
was a lot of that going on.I™m trying to think, yeah. 
 

Q: If I can ask you a question. 

 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: How would you characterize being very Y
ugoslavian Nationalist versus when you talk 
about becomi ng Croatian?  Ho
w does one distinguish? 
 

A: Well– 

 

Q: How would you distinguish? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
12 
 
A: For me , I think this happened when I 
was ma ybe I was eleven. I guess you suddenly 
became aware of that this was 
a repressive regime  and that  people™s friends were being Œ 
were being oppressed and also the peasants. At
 that time , Doctor Ma
cek, who was sort of 
the leader of the Croatian peasant party 
and then later on beca
me  a me mbe r  of the 
governme nt, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade. You 
have Œ a lot of taxes and Œ not
 a lot, most, almost everythi
ng went to Belgrade. So, there 
it was [coughs], excuse me , there was a great de
al of corruption of one kind or another. 
Money that was collected in taxes simply disa
ppeared in Belgrade, and public works that 
were necessary in Croatia never took place. 
They were done in Belgrade. They weren™t 
even done in Serbia. They were stalled al
ong the way. And, later on, 
there was a political 
Œ I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which is 
convenio
, but actually they Œ the 
Croatian Peasant party was act
ually now a public party, and 
it was not anything that was 
repressed in such a way, and there was a 
coalition governme nt for med with Doctor 
Macek. And I reme mber during this, during the election campaign when you™d drive out 

in the countryside, you know, 
the peasants would yell, ﬁ
Zi vio Doktor Macek!
ﬂ You also 
yelled, ﬁ
Zivio Doktor Macek!
ﬂ, and so on - May he live long. 
 

Q: And what does that me a n? 

 

A: Doctor Œ ﬁMay he live long,ﬂ I mean, ﬁHa
il,ﬂ or whatever you want to Doctor Macek. 
And this Œ the Croatian consciousness, which 
had been really very, very repressed Œ and 
ma ybe that was one reason why all those Ustash
es were successful later on because, you 
know, of course, they via a Bulgarian assassin kille
d Alexander, and af
ter that, there was 
a very repressive regime  in Belgrade 
which repressed Croatia most of all. 
 

Q: Really? More than a
ny of the other–provinces? 
 

A :  M u c h  mo r e ,  mu c h  mo r e .  

 

Q: And did you feel that? 

 

A: I didn™t feel it, no. I did not 
feel it, but I mean, it was talk
ed about a lot in school. Like, 
for instance, ﬁGod forbid, Croatia is not th
e Balkans. The Balkans stop at the Sava 
River.ﬂ 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes, yes, that kind of stuff. 

 

Q: So, who was  Croatia, from 
that point of view, if not 
the Balkans?  Just Croa tia? 
 

A: It was Croatia. And actually, geographically, 
it does stop there, and that™s how far the 
Turks went. I mean, this is where they were
 stopped before going, getting into Vienna. 
 

Q: At the same  time, Alexander™s assassinated in 1934. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
13 
 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: In 1933, Hitler™s over in Germa
ny. Are you very conscious of this? 

 

A: Yes, yes, completely conscious because I reme mber Œ I reme mber walking through a 
street, I must have been reading. Obviousl
y, I wa s reading. There was a Œ I™ll regress a 
little bit. Some where in 1933 or 
™34, my parents went to Chicago Œ whenever the World™s 
Fair was in Chicago. It ma y 
have be en in ™34. Was it? 
 

Q: I don™t know. 

 

A: Some where there. Okay, I think it ma y have
 been ™33 or ™34. When I tell you the next 
date, you will reme mber. We were in Slove
nia on vacation with Agnes Coyne, Pippsi, 
and a friend of my mother™s, a
nd this was right on the Austri
an border, and this was the 
year when Dolfuss was assassina ted in Austria. He  was the chancellor at  the time. My 

parents got very scared, and phoned Zagreb 
and some body c a me  to see, to remove us  

from the border of Austria, and that™s wh en things started becomi ng Œ became  obvious 

that things were going to be happening in 
Austria. And, I reme mber the election when 
Hitler was elected as chancellor because there was a demonstration in Zagr eb, and I 

reme mber seeing a Œ there was a newspaper. I 
don™t think the paper 
was edited there, but 
there was a shop window where the headlines we
re posted, the front page of one of the 
papers was posted, and I reme mber seeing th
is. Then you started talking about anti-

Se mitism and so on, and that™s what I, how I reme mber this. 
 

Q: You were 12 or 13? 

 
A: Aboutthat,yes. 
 

Q: Do you and your friends talk about this? 

 

A: Very much s o. In the first place, we had, 
very soon after that, refugees comi ng in. Not  
under horrendous duress, but wanti
ng to leave Austria, and we had very intimate friends 
there, which was a mi xed marriage. The 
husband was Jewish. The mother was not 
Jewish. They wanted to leave. They came, they
 stayed with us, and they finally left for 
Argentina. One of the me n who we re working in
 my father™s factory. Actually, he was in 
charge of livestock. He was half German and 
half Argentine, and as you know, they had a 
big cattle industry in Argentina, and he was 
there for years on the farm. The farm was 
part of the factory, as I told you. This was 
all Œ molasses were there and the cows were 
eating part of it, and so, this ma n, who 
had both German and Argentine citizenship, 
ma naged to get these friends, whose name  was 
Polla (sp), visas to go to Ar gentina, and 
they stayed with us in th
e meanti me . And more and more Austrian Jews were comi ng, 
sitting in coffeehouses. That™s when there st
arted to be some  unpleasant rema rks were 
ma de, ﬁDo we need these German s peaking fo
reigners sitting here
?ﬂ Then it became, 
ﬁGerma n speaking Jews.ﬂ And obviously they we
re staying either in rooming houses or 
hotels or with friends, but they were Œ 
everybody was Œit was a coffeehouse society. I 
mean, my mother went to coffeehouse, my 
father Œ not the same  one mi nd you. The me n 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
14 
 
played cards in one place, and the wome n had 
their bridge game  some pla ce else or just 
went for coffee. So, it was a coffeehouse so
ciety like Vienna, and so on. You know, here 
they are talking German. At 
that point, nobody, none of the Croatian Jews spoke German. 
We were Œ except to them. I mean, it was, 
ﬁPlease don™t speak German.ﬂ And we didn™t. 
 

Q: So, you, at that point, began to 
feel a certain kind of threat. 
 

A: Absolutely. Absolutely, from that time  on, 
and i t  was getting more and more. There wa s 
talk of Dachau, for instance. There were no 
killing camps. There were no extermination 
camps. There were concentration camps and 
political camps and so on, and we knew of 
them. We  knew that things were starting to 
happen, and at that poi
nt, obviously, we were 
Œ oh, and then for instance, we had a subscription to 
Neue Freie Presse
, which then we 
didn™t want to have anymore. Then, instead 
of the German papers, the Austrian papers, 
my father got Swiss papers, and everybody was 
listening to the radi
o to see what was 
happening, and so on. That was very Œ 
that felt threatening already.  
 

Q: Do you see the beginnings of the Ustashe or is it- ? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Youdon™t? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: At this point? 

 
A: No, not at all, not at all. 
 

Q: Do you have any personal experience with 
people starting to say some thing about you as 
a Jewish person? 
 

A: No,never. 

 

Q: Never? 

 

A: Never. 

 

Q: It™sinteresting. 

 

A: Never, and I don™t think 
anybody else really. Never. 
 

Q: But you decide you will not talk German. 

 

A: Not only I, and there were a lot of people 
for whom it was hard because their education 
had been Austro-Hungarian, and there Œ andtheir literary language was not Croatian. 

Mine was. I spoke German, but I never - 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
15 
 
 
Q: Was it true for non-Jews as
 well as Jews the decision not
 to speak German, or was it 
ma inly the Jewish population? 
 

A: I think ma inly the Jewish population, y
eah, because the upper-middle class, non-Jewish, 
probably continued. These were remnants 
of old Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy, 
aristocracy and so on, and they spoke Germa
n. And there were certa
in parts of Croatia 
where German was spoken almost as an ever
yday language. It never was with me , but for 

instance, Osijek, my great-grandmother, spoke 
Cr oatian, and very well and correctly, but 

she was more comfortable in German. But that was the town of Osijek where ther e was a 

great Œ by the way, that was a very large 
Volksdeutsche
 population around 
there that had 
come  in Œ Slavians that had come  in, I don™t know, in the 17
th
 century, 18
th
 century, a 
whole batch of them who then became quislings 
of the worst sort. But, I mean, there were 
villages of nothing but Ge rman-speak
ing people in, mostly in Slavonia. 
 

Q: Did you spend any time with these Aust
rian Jews who were comi ng through? 
 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: And, how would you characterize them because
 they™re obviously leaving earlier than the 
Einschluss
 because you were still– 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Right? 

 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: What is that  they think 
is going to happen, or what–? 
 

A: They are, I don™t know, they were not comf
ortable. There was one and possibly, now that 
I think of it, these were mostly mi xed 
ma rriages. There was another very well-off 
industrialist by the name  of 
Alfred Braun, who was ma rried to a non-Jewish Austrian 
woma n, who took off for Kenya, 
and he was a business friend of my father™s, and I 
reme mber them comi ng on business occasions 
previously, and then leaving for Kenya 
from Yugosl a via, as I reme mber. 
 

Q: Do you remember young people 
your age, young teenagers? 
 

A: One of them was Œ with fa milies only Œ and another thing that  happened is we all used to 
wear dirndl s, you know Austrian Œ not real di
rndl s because they were too expensive to 
wear Œ but, you know, the little 
aprons and dresses with little puff sleeves. Everybody 
stopped wearing that. My brother had lederhosen
. That was Œ I still have a picture of him 
as a small child, and then all that disappeare
d. It was also worn in Slovenia, you know, on 
the border, but we all sto
pped wearing stuff like that. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
16 
 
Q: Let me  ask you some thing, does this stop 
because it™s Œ you™re feeling anti-German? 
 
A: Yes. Anti-Austrian at first, and then, yeah. 

 

Q: So, you want no identif
ication in this way? 
 

A: That™sright. 

 

Q: Were you, yourself, wondering what Œ woul
d there be war, or would there be 
concentration camps, or would–? 
 

A: There would be–a threat. 

 

Q: Whatever that would be. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Youwouldn™t– 

 

A: No, there would be a threat. And we, obviously
 Œ I me an, then later on things started to 
develop and Croatia was entirely surrounde
d by countries to which you couldn™t go in, 
either pro-Nazi or were actually
 overrun or whatever. So, it was 
sort of like a little island, 
especially when the Germans entered Greece, it was very threatening, but that™s much 

later on. 
 

Q: Now, in the Jewish groups– 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: The gymnas tic groups– 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Is there a lot of talk among the Jewish kids? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: About what all this means? 

 

A: I think so. I think so, yes, sure. 

 

Q: You do remember that, yourself? 

 

A: I reme mber. Certainly, I reme mber, and 
I had a conversation with Œ what I didn™t 
reme mber was brought back to me  a couple of
 years ago, talking to
 the same  friend of 
mi ne who sa id, ﬁAh! Your father was so smart and got you out in time .ﬂ I said, ﬁYou 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
17 
 
couldn™t get out.ﬂ People di
dn™t have the means. There were ma ny reasons why you 
couldn™t get out, and I said Œ and she said, 
ﬁI became  aware of that when the first 
Austrian refugees knocked on our door
.ﬂ I don™t reme mber anybody knocking on our 
door to come  and stay, and she said ﬁThat™s 
when I started pushing my mother,ﬂ who, by 
the way, was ma rried to a non-Jewish Slovene 
of German des cent or Austrian descent 
and so on. Saved them in one way or another, in
 other ways not. So, of course, we talked 
about it, of course we did. 
 

Q: Did you remember other 
people knocking at your door? 
 

A: No, people who ca me , I mean, yeah. 

 

Q: Theyknew? 

 

A: They knew. Now, for instance, another group that came was this Œ again, this is people 
from my father™s hometown, their name was Di
erenbach, and they were from Pozega and 
two brothers who went and became bankers Œ one in Nuremburg, the ot her in Dresdner. 

They both work at the Dresdner Bank, both ma
rried to very, very German Jewish women. 
I mean, very German, intensely so, and they ha
d Œ they didn™t have dual-nationality. They 

were already German, a nd the son must have b
een about 13 at the time. This family came 
back and settled and the boy 
started learning Croatian, and 
spoke it. The mother never 
learned Croatian. And so, they were part of 
our group. I mean, he became part of fairly 
close knit Œ my cousins, and this boy, especi
ally because they were originally Œ the 
parents were originally from 
my father™s hometown. Yeah, th
ey kept trickling in. There 
weren™t huge boatloads, not boatloads
, trainloads of people comi ng in. 
 
Q: So, why, in 1937, did you go to Oxford, or prepare to go to Oxford, in England? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

A: My father was always very anglophile and 
I wanted to go. I didn™t want to be in my 
school anymore, and later on my brother came. He
 went also to school 
there, but that was 
it. That was it. 
 

Q: It had nothing to do with 
your father worrying that ma ybe 
he should get you out, at this 
point?  
 

A: No. No. No, because I ke pt comi ng home . 

 

Q: Back and forth? 

 

A: Back and forth all the time , no. Obviously, we
 were in England. My fa mily Œ I must have 
been on vacation or something and we went ba
ck Œ and a whole bunch of my fa mily Œ my 
brother was still in Zagreb, but a whole bunch 
of the fa mily was in London at the time of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
18 
 
Munich. And we all went back, and I reme mber Œ I reme mber Cha mberlain, and I 
reme mber the French being Œ the army wa
s called up. What do you call it when an army 

is Œmobilized. We  went through Paris, because 
the train you used was the Orient Express. 
That was the one way of going. There wasn™t anyt
hing elite about it. It™s
 just Œ that™s the 
train. That was the line. And 
there was some members of 
a fa mily who had moved from 
Zagreb to some where else whose sons were in
 England already in sc
hool, that™s right, at 
the university both of them, two boys. I suspec
t maybe there ma y have be en a question in 
that case of mobilization of kids to the army, and these were boys of the age that they 

would have been mobilized in Yugoslavia, ma
ybe that™s the reason why they went there, 

but this was also a family that had a 
Precepteur
, a French ma le governess, and then an 
English ma le governess, and they spoke Englis
h and they went to 
school in England, both 
of them. They were Alfred a
nd Erich Miller, their name was.
 And they were there, their 
parents were there, and two uncles of ours were
 there, and I guess they came to leave me  

in school. And in fact, I was at Oxford. I was already– 
 

Q: You were there already? 

 

A: I was there already, and they picked me  up 
and we went back because my father Œ they 
hadn™t prepared anything. My brother was in
 Zagreb, going to school
 quite norma lly. And 
then we stayed until things sort of blew 
over, and I went back with my brother, I 
reme mber. I may have the Œ I may have the dates off a little bit. 
 

Q: As far as I know, you went to Oxford in ™37. 

 

A: It must have been earlier, I think ™36. 

 
Q: You think ™36? 
 

A: I think it must have been ™36. Some where I 
ha ve a piece of Œ no, it may have been ™37 Œ I 
have a piece of paper some where where my fa
ther is asking permission from the Ministry 
of Finance to buy a certain number of fo
reign currency for my schooling and my 
brother™s schooling abroad. You had to have 
it, and you had to show you passed whatever 
exams were necessary to get the next year™s
 quota of money, of Pound St erling to export, 
because you were not allowed to ta
ke any money out of Yugoslavia. 
 

Q: So, do you think before Cha mberlain and M
unich, which is 1938, th
at you were already 
at Oxford? 
 

A: Yes, I was already, yes, I was. 

 

Q: Why would you father want you back? 

 

A: The fa mily should be together. That™s why. 

 

Q: Do you think your father, in 1938 or even before, was thinking about how to get the 
whole fa mily out of Croatia? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
19 
 
 
A: I think probably so. I think so. 

 

Q: But you were not talking about this with him.  

 

A: No. 

 

Q: He didn™t say anything? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: So you go back for a few months-  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Before the attack on Poland. 

 

A: Oh,yeah. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: That whole year, almost a whole year. 

 

Q: So, you™re back almost a whole year. Do 
you see your fa mily at this point, during this 
time? 
 
A: Yes, probably I went on you know, on leave. 
 

Q: Do you see brother fairly regularly? 

 

A: At Oxford, all the time, every weekend I 
had to take him and a bunch of other boys for 
lunch because I was the oldest one, and they
 were entrusted to me . It was disgusting 
 

Q: You were not happy with that? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Why?  

 

A: It was horrible. They had dreadful unifo
r ms with boaters, you know, with straw hats, 
horrendous uniforms, and they handed them over to me  and I had to turn them back in. 
 

Q: So, how close was St. Edward™s to- 

 

A: Very close. It was at Oxford. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
20 
 
Q: I see. So, the wome n did not wear a
nything, but the boys we
re wearing these - 
 
A: This was high school. This was what they
 called public school. It was horrendous. I was 
very embarrassed. I was the one who was taking care of them. 
 

Q: Now, you returned to Zagreb in ™39. 

 

A: Andmybrother. 

 

Q: And your brother? 

 

A: And the Englishman that I was sort of engaged to. 

 

Q: Right, so this is the summer 
right before the attack on Poland. 
 

A: Yes, right, exactly, exactly. 

 

Q: So, we™ll stop the tape  now becau
se we™re at the end of the tape.

Tape #3 
 
Q: Let™s go back, before we get to, in Zagreb
 in 1939, describe the scene as you™re going 
through Paris after Munich. What does that look like? 
 

A: This was just , just, just  ex
actly a day or two after Munic
h, total chaos with French me n 
being mobilized, some in uniform, some in ha
lf a uniform. The trains were, including the 
Orient Express, complete Œ I mean that we
 Œ there was only sta
nding room. People were 
sitting on, on suitcases, and completely and ab
solutely chaotic. And then when we came  

to Croatia, everything was quiet. I mean, to Yugoslavia. 
 

Q: So, it must have been 
frightening to see that. 

 

A: It was extremely frighteni
ng. It was extremely frightening. 
In fact, we almost mi ssed the 
train because  my father was rushing out to ge
t the latest Swiss papers to read it from a 
neutral point of view, and as he was goi
ng in, he pushed somebody and he some thing 
like, ﬁPardon,ﬂ or some thing Œ no, my father
 said, ﬁPardonﬂ, and th
e guy said in French, 
ﬁFichez-moi  la paix!ﬂ, and my father™s Fren
ch wa sn™t very good and he thought he was 
talking about peace, but what the guy was sa
ying to him was, ﬁLeave me alone.ﬂ Or 

some thing like that. And, my father said, ﬁOui
, oui, j™espère bien,ﬂ or some thing like that. 
Then, we went on. I remember me mbers of the family sitting on suitcases. That™s how- 
 

Q: How crowd e d it was. 

 

A: How crowd e d it was in corridors. I m
ean, my mother and I sat inside in a 
wagonlit
 (ph), 
but it was totally crazy, and I™m trying to think 
where it was that it sorted petered out, all 
of the craziness, because when we came to Za
greb it was fairly norma l, the train, but it 
was, for two or three hours, it 
was this chaotic situation. 
 

Q: Now, when you go to Zagreb for this 
summer of 1939, and your fiancé Joseph Heaton - 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: - is with you?  And you™re a young woma n. You™re 18 years old. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: When did you meet Joseph? 

 

A: AtOxford.  

 

Q: AtOxford? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: He was a student there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
22 
 
 
A: He had just graduated. 

 

Q: Was he your first boyfriend? 

 

A: No, no, no. Not I mean really boyfriend. None of these were really serious boyfriends. 
This was a serious boyfriend. This wa s a 
serious, engaged boyfriend, so to speak, 
unofficially, I would say, but expected to. 
 

Q: Yeah? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: How long had you known hi m?  

 

A: Maybe six months or 
so. It was pretty fast. 
 

Q: Were you in classes together? 

 

A: No, no, no. The schools were not together. No, he
, he Œ I had just started, and he had just 
graduated with a useless degr
ee in history. But, I mean th
is was an Eton-Christchurch 
type person, and it was just love. We  fell in love. 
 

Q: He was three or four years older than you? 

 

A: More than that, ma ybe even six. 
 
Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So, when Œ 

 

A: No, I know what Œ he is Œ I know exac tly when he was born. He was born in 1917. 

 

Q: 1917? 

 

A: And, I was born in ™21, four years. 

 

Q: Notbad. 

 

A: Not bad. At that time, no, at that time  it was huge, yes. 

 

Q: Had your parents me t him?  

 

A: I was bringing him home, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
23 
 
 
Q: Yes? 

 

A: Yes, and my  brother was the chaperone. 

 

Q: And your brother knew him from-? 

 

A: My brother knew him.  

 

Q: Did they like  each othe r? 

 

A: Yes, sure, sure, sure. 

 

Q: So, how was  your parents™ response? 

 

A: My father was very positive.
 My mother was very negative. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes. She didn™t Œ she wanted me  probabl
y to ma rry a Jewish boy from Za greb who I 
could stay home with. This meant to her th
at I wa s going to take off and live God only 
knows where, possibly in the colonies. Who 
knows what?  His father, this guy™s father 
had all sorts of interests. Hi
s older brother was what was then called on the Gold Coast. 
He had graduated, and they had some kind of in
terest in Africa. So, my mother had these 
visions of my living somewhere colonial
, which really frightened her, I think. 
 
Q: Now, he wa sn™t Jewish, a
nd that bothered your mother? 
 
A: No. 

 

Q: And that bothered your mother, then. 

 

A: I think it ma y have bothered my mother, yeah. 

 

Q: But she didn™t say 
that to you directly? 
 

A: No, she intima ted it. [laughs] 

 

Q: But her biggest fear was you 
go live in those crazy colonies? 
 

A: Yes, yes, yes, in the colonies and for G
od™s sakes in England, where the climate was so 
horrible and the bathrooms were so cold. A
nd that kind of stuff, and ﬁ Who™s going to 
bring up my  child?ﬂ By that time  in Engla
nd, people were having a lot of household help, 
let™s put it that way, and als
o, on top of it, his parents we
re divorced, which was another 
horrible fault. And, yeah, like that. But, my 
father liked him very much from the wor d Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
24 
 
well, my fat her was muc h more anglophile, a
lthough my mot her spoke
 absolutely perfect 
English; my father did not. 
 
Q: Do you think that she liked him, but was 
worried about what he was going to bring you 
to, or do you think she rea
lly didn™t like him some how? 
 

A: I™m trying to think. He was a different cult
ure. He was– No, no, for instance, it bothered 
her Œ boys in Zagreb were, you know, very mu
c h coat and tie and so on, and he was a 
rowing blue. 
 

Q: He was a what? 

 

A: He was a rowing blue. He was the one 
who did the Cambridge, Oxford/Ca mbridge 
rowing team. 
 

Q: I see. So, he was wearing sweaters? 

 

A: He was wearing, yes, spor
ts clothes, which were ver
y, let™s say, informal. It was 
different. 
 

Q: And, that was attractive to you, wasn™t it? 

 

A: I think so, yes, yes, that
 and being Œ not being obvious 
as I wa s in Zagreb. He talks 
among other people who didn™t care who I was,
 that anonymity was very nice. Then I 
came back and the anonymity was gone. 
 
Q: It was gone? 
 

A: It was gone because I reme mber Œ oh, he did 
have Œ he was wearing a pair of white slacks 
and a white blazer, which is what these peopl
e wore, and I wa s walking down the street 
in Zagreb. And some body saw him, of my 
older friends, actually a very well-known 
historian, a woma n by the name  of Fici Des
pot (ph). She was one who ended up by being 
a Croatian leading historian, and she saw us
 on the street, and some body asked her, ﬁDid 
you see Lucie with the guy, with
 the Englishman? ﬂ  And she 
said, ﬁYes.ﬂ And she said, 
ﬁ What did he look like? ﬂ And she said, ﬁL
ike the ice cream man.ﬂ So, you know, it was 
like that. 
 

Q: Was he shocked when he came and saw how your-? 

 

A: No, he came  from a very wealthy family. Although the family was divorced and his 
mother lived in the lake 
district, and so on. So, no. 
 

Q: So, he was perfectly comfortable? 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471

Q: So, you had a big sociallife during that summer? 
 

A: Yes, because  two days after we were there, or  ma ybe three days after we arrived, four 
other people that we knew from Oxford ar
rived Œ two young me n. Two 
were journalists, 
and two were people that I just
 knew who had just graduate
d, who were Œ but not friends 
of Joe™s. They me t there. He was very jealous, as a ma tter of fact
, but I had ma de these 
arrangements previously, and they came  a
nd they were going to go do a tour of the 
Balkans or Europe or whatever afterwards, a
nd they stayed with us. And then there was 
the invasion of Poland in September, and all of
 them i mmediately went
 to Zagreb to the 
British Consulate and immediately Œ immediat
ely reported, and the other four took off 
right away, almost immediatel
y, to go to England, and Joe stayed ma ybe another week 
and went back. That™s the last time I saw hi
m. They put him on the train a week later. 
 

Q: Did you try to convinc
e him not to leave? 
 

A: Oh, no, no, I would have gone myself. We  we
re all very gung-ho to
 go fight Hitler one 
way or another. 
 

Q: That must have been very sad time for you. 

 

A: It was horrible. I reme mb er it. It was on the ra
ilroad station, and of c
ourse at that time to 
embrace a man you weren™t ma rried to or what
ever, kiss hi m on the railroad station, my 
parents averted their heads and went off, 
and it was so on. Maybe I was here and they 
were 100 meters away. Underneath there™s way,
 there™s a whole new... I think my mother 
was relieved. 
 
Q: You think she was relieved? 
 

A: She was relieved. She was very fond of this person who, whose photograph I had, who 
was more to her liking and also, you know... 
 

Q: But this was not typical to have peopl
e who were not ma rried kissing and certainly 
kissing in public. 
 

A: Oh, God, terrible 

 

Q: You learned really terrible things at Oxford. 

 

A: Yes, yes, but then I was supposed to have 
been engaged to him officially, so to speak. 
 

Q: Right. So, what happens th
en?  You™re Œ you were in Zagr
eb, you™re obviously not going 
back. 
 

A: I can™t go back. I can™t go back to the place. 
So, then I st art taking Œ 
my brother,let™s put 
it that way, had lost a year. In 
order to get back to high schoo
l, he had to go to a private 
school to ma ke up subjects such as Na
tional History, Croatian Language, Yugoslav 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
26 
 
Geography, which was a separate subject and 
so on, and he went to a private school 
which was horrendously terrible for him becau
se only retarded kids went to private 
schools, but he went for a whole year before 
he could ma ke up and then go to a regular 
high school after that. That was really trauma
tic because Œ yeah, I reme mber that very 
well. I did odds and ends. I took classes in Hi
story of Art. There was some sort of free 
university which was for people who did not 
Œ who were not inscribed, that you could go 

to classes. The British Council was running E
nglish classes and I sat in on them for 
laughs, really, because a friend of mi ne had gone
 there and did a course in proficiency in 
English which oddly, some where in ™47, I got th
e results of the exams. Could you believe 
it?  Some body found them at the British Council af
ter the war through a relative of mi ne. I 
learned typing, so I would know some thing wort
hwhile and practical for the future. In 
fact, I brought an Olivetti with me  on the 
trip to the United States. I went  to these 
ridiculous balls that were Œ You were launc
hed in Zagreb when you went to a certain 
dance. 
 

Q: And launched, is it -? 

 

A: As a debutante. Until you were 18, you were
 a snotty-nose that nobody even considered 
as a person. You were a school child, a 
school girl, and so on, but after the 
Matura
, after 
you graduated from high school, which I did notthere, but I got to be 18 years old, you 

went to these various balls, and the ball 
was the, oddly enough, the journalist ball, and 
once you were at the journalist ball, I gue
ss you were ready to get ma rried ma ybe. 
Anyhow, then you were in society. Then you 
can Œ I mean, then you were no longer led 
by the hand, although supervised se
riously, but you were launched. 
 

Q: Now, these launchings, this is a mi xe
d launching?  This is Jewish, Catholic- 
 

A: Oh,absolutely. 

 

Q: Everybody? 

 

A: Completely. Completely absolutely. 

 

Q: And, this was horrendous for you? 

 

A: For me , it was horrendous. It was, you know, firs
t of all, wearing ridiculous clothes that I 
hated with high heels, which I still hate. 
You had to have these dresses ma de on the 
whole, because there was no ready-to-wear, wh
ich was standing in fr
ont of dressmakers™ 
mi rrors being prodded hither and yon by mother
s, by dressmakers, by couturiers, and so 

on. It was hard, but you went. 
 

Q: Did your mo ther like this? 

 

A: I don™t think so. That was the duty, this was 
duty, but my mother Œ I was, and I still am, 
horribly nearsighted. To wear 
glasses, my God, I mean, you k
now Œ it was torn off of my 
face. So, a number of people as I walked on 
the street and I didn™t curtsey properly, it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
27 
 
reported to my mother, and I didn™t see the 
poor person who was reporting me . Pictures, 
photographs were taken of no glasses on, God fo
rbid. It was awful. 
It was boring. It was 
terrible. I had to stand straight, and I sl
ouch on the whole; I always did. And it was 
boring. It was horribly boring. 
 
Q: So, this was going in evenings. 

 

A: This was going on in evenings. 

 

Q: During the day- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Or in the evenings wh
en this wasn™t happening- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Are there people comi ng to your parents™ house? 

 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: Politicianscomi ng 
and discussions about- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: About what™s going on- 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: And are you able to- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: At least observe, or
 can you participate? 

 

A: Oh, no, I™m there. 

 

Q:  You™ r e t h er e? 

 

A: I™mthere. 

 

Q: Can you talk about that? 

 

A: Yes. One of the things that
™s going on is you™re listening to
 Radio Paris. Paris Radio had 
a Yugoslav by the name  of Œ I can™t reme mber
, but I do have his name  wr itten down Œ he 
was Œ oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. He had one of these programs, like Voice of America 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
28 
 
had later on, where he was broadcasting to 
Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans, 
and then when France fell, he went on Œ not 
to Vichy Œ he ended up in the United States, 
but he followed the French governme nt where 
he could Œ where he was broadcasting, and 
he ended up in the United States, and I ende
d up doing translations 
for the censors here 
for him, and when he was sick doing his br
oadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav governme nt, 
which was very funny, you were listening to th
at. You were listening again on the radio 
to neutral radio stations, a
nd there were family councils around the table, and friends. 
What™s going to happen now that
 Hitler™s about to get us al
l?  But, you didn™t know where 
and how. This was Œ these were family councils going on among the me mbers of the 
fa milies Œ dining rooms or another. It  was constant. And people who had lived in the 

provinces, like the parents of 
these cousins that were in Lo
ndon, moved to Zagreb to be 
handy to be able to leave if anybody was able 
to leave. The major problem was that there 
were currency restrictions. 
You couldn™t send any money out. 
The other problem was that 
my father was a rese rve officer, a captain fi
rst class, and he would have had to have 
gotten permission fr om the army to leave. They were sending mobilizat ions going on. 

There wasn™t  mobilizing, but ther e was a Œ ther
e was a state of alert, let™s say. My father 
Œ not my father, anybody, this wasn™t anyt
hing exclusive Œ had to do every Œ I don™t 
reme mber when you, probably, at various interv
als, but at that time, I think, every two 
years, you had to go and do some  active duty as an officer. He was a reserve officer in the 

Yugoslav army, and every once in a while, they
 would pull you for th
ree months or six 
months or whatever to re- I don™t know Œ 
to get them up, you know, to whatever was 
going to happen. To get them ready for necessa ry combat, and my father Œ this was 

probably in 1940 Œ was in Split for three 
months doing his military duty, and I had 
nothing to do. So, I came to stay with him in
 Split, and that was very exciting, very nice 
first of all, nobody was supervising me . I was liv
ing in a hotel, and I would see him in the 
evening for dinner with the rest of the officer
s, which was also fun, I must say. One of the 
officers, there, was the Ima m of the Muslim
 soldiers because, you know, just behind the 
mountain is Bosnia, and there were number
 of recruits who we re Muslim. And I 
reme mber on one occasion how aware they we
re of Hitler and anti-Semitism. The I mam 
saying to my father, ﬁDon™t you worry about anything, Fredo. If they come , I will say 

you™re Muslim. The ma i n thing has been done 
already.ﬂ So, you know, this is Œ this is 
what Œ I think that™s sort 
of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them. 
 

Q: Can you explain that because the people
 who are watching ar
en™t going to know? 
 

A: Muslims and Jews are of circumcised. That™s what it was. 

 

Q: And, the only me n in Europe that who were– 

 

A: That™s right. That™s right. Absolutely. 

 

Q: So, what were you doing during the day? 

 

A: Reading, writing letters to Joe Heaton. 

 

Q: So, you were still keeping 
up obviously this connection- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
29 
 
 
A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: You™re hearing from hi m? 

 

A: Oh, yes. Absolutely, absolutely. 

 

Q: Was he in Burma?  

 

A: No, he was first in England getting trained, 
and then he was in India for quite a long time. 
He was camped in Peshawar, places like that. That was the summer. 
 

Q: That™sveryexotic. 

 

A: Yes, very exotic. In India, New Delhi a
nd then, you know, when the heat got horrendous 
they went to Northwest province, which was Kashmi r, I guess.  
 

Q: So, you™re not dating anyone 
else, right?  At this point. 
 

A: Not, dating. I™m going out, yeah, ye
ah. I™m going out. Everybody knows. Everybody 
knows, but I do go to the darned balls a
nd to coffeehouses and so on, but you know, 
mildly so. 
 

Q: But, now, you were able to spend time with 
your father alone without all of this social- 

 

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you talk together about Œ is he telling 
you now that he™s trying to
 figure out a way to 
get you all out? 
 

A: Not at that pa rticular mo me nt, but yes, 
we talked, because this group was trained to 
withstand the Italian army, because, you 
know. Okay, so, obviously, I mean, we know 
what they™re getting to, you know, to face. We  did talk about it, sure. Then, as I™m 

walking along in Split looking at shop wi
ndows or whatever, ma ybe palaces, ma ybe 
Diocletian™s Palace, something more cultural,
 my high school class turns up on their high 
school graduation trip, and I joined them, and 
that was a rather amusing thing because I 

have all of these dressy clot
hes. I was dressi ng in the evening in this hotel where they 
were staying. So, I packed all of that up, and 
I left it with my father
 who then sent it to 

Zagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldie
r was supposed to escort me  to this third-
class bus that my class was ridi ng in to 
go to Dubrovnik, and I ma de a little suitcase of 

some  kind or other, and this was like five 
o™clock in the morning, five-thirty in the 
morning, and suddenly there™s this knock 
on the door. And I said, ﬁWho is it?ﬂ in 

Croatian, and the ma n says, ﬁThe army.ﬂ He 
wa s some  kind of guy who was in Œ who my 
father had sent to pick me up. So, this was 
the army that was getting me  out of bed, and 
left me  there, and I joined this whole group, 
and then we finally got back to Zagreb on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
30 
 
some  horrible third-class train, sleeping on th
e floor, as ____ I was saying how they were 
doing in Dubrovnik on ma ttresses on the 
floor, and that™s what we did. 
 
Q: So, now do you think your father was in Split in 1940? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: So, then, you go back to Zagreb. 

 

A: We go back to Zagreb. 

 

Q: Now, is there a sense in Zagreb now for you 
diffe rent from what it was the year before, 
two years before, as a Jewish person? 
 

A: Yes, very much. 

 

Q: And, what is that? 

 

A: And my father was very anxious for me  to
 get out, and I know that I had papers. I know 
that I had to get a piece of paper that said 
that I was unmarried, which I had notarized. I 
know that I went to get a birth certificate,
 which I had translated and notarized Œ 
translated into English and o
fficially notarized to send to 
England, to have with me . And, 
I actually think that I had a Greek visa, if 
I™m not mi staken, which Œ because Greece was 
not invaded yet, to go, I guess, 
via Iraq or some thing, Turkey, 
via Iraq to India, which, of 
course, never took place, but I do reme mber ge
tting a Greek visa, and a letter from the 
Counsel General. Those Counsel Generals are 
very interesting things. There are a number 
of honorary Counsel Generals who were Je
wish, and one was a Greek. The other was 
Portuguese, who also gave me  a visa, and 
the other was Uruguayan. These were all 
Zagreb Jews, well off in CD cars. 
 

Q: CD?  

 

A: 
Corps diplomatique
, CD on their cars. Diplomatic corp. 
 

Q: When I asked you that it was diffe
rent for you as a Jewish person- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: InZagreb- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Is that because you could feel a certain kind of anti-Semitism toward Jewish people? 

 

A: I did not feel it. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
31 
 
Q: Youdidn™t? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: You just know? 

 

A: You just know. You fee l  completely su
rrounded by Œ you feel actually jailed. I mean, 
where are you going to go?  You 
have to get out. I mean- 
 

Q: So, it™s not that in Croatia- 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: It™sthatCroatia
 is being surrounded - 
 

A: Yes 

 

Q: And, you don™t know what™s going to happen? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes. Yugoslavia. In Croatia, you 
already started feeling th
at you didn™t want to 
be there when it happened. 
 

Q: Is ___?  Or not? 

 

A: Yes, because I think that there must have been Œ there must have been intimations 
already. I™m not aware of it, but I do know th
at there must have been some  people who 
were quite happy with what was going on in
 Germany. I don™t know a personal one. I do 
know that I me t, the day before I left in, 
let™s say, the Yugoslav portugates (ph), the 
German ____ on March 27
th
, and like on March 28
th
 or 29
th
, I was on the ma in square and 
I ran into two friends of mi ne from hi
gh school, two guys, and I said, ﬁGuys, we™re 

leaving.ﬂ Because, by that time, we already had our American visa and everythi ng else, 

and one of them, who was a Communist, who la
ter became director  of the Zagreb theater, 
and the other one, who™s father became  director
 of the University under the Ustashe, were 
standing there, these are my r
eally close friends from school, and they said, ﬁNow you are 
leaving, when we need you?!ﬂ I said, ﬁYou™ll 
have to do without me .ﬂ These people were 
activists, but they didn™t
 do anything, collaborated. 
 

Q: Okay,we™llstop.

Tape #4 
 
Q: Lucie, tell me  a little bi
t more about your meeting these 
two guys. What Œ they thought 
that you would help them in terms 
of resisting what would happen? 
 

A: Exactly, exactly, they thought 
I would be very useful. They were both at that time  very 
left-leaning, not party me mbers, but they we
re left -leaning, and they obviously knew that 
things were going to happen now, and as I sa
id, ﬁGuys, we™re leaving,ﬂ they said, ﬁNow?  
When we need you?ﬂ ﬁSorry, I™ve got to go.ﬂ 
 

Q: Why would they have thought you would have 
been an activist?  Wa s that some thing that 
you gave inclinations of? 
 

A: I think so. I think they knew where my 
heart was, and they knew, I mean, obviously I 
wasn™t a Communist. One of them ma y have be
en a me mbe r  of the party at one time, but 
he did Œ he served in the Croatian Ustash
e army. The other one, the other one, whose 
father was a very famous  gramma rian, we us
ed his gramma r, nowaday
s I think it™s still 
probably used. His name was Ivsic, became dir
ector in the Za greb University, so, I mean 
the University of Zagreb during Ustashe time, no. 
 

Q: So, you wouldn™t call yo
urself left-leaning? 
 

A: Yes, yes, liberal, left-leaning, lib
eral left-leaning, okay, yes, yes.  
 

Q: So, you said prior ta
lking to about this incident w
ith the boys, that your father was 
engaged in trying to get you out. So, there must
 have been different plans that he was 
working on. 
 

A: There were different plans. 
We ll, I wanted to go and see Jo
e, but then everything Œ it got 
to be almost impossible as various frontiers
 were closing around us constantly. I me a n, 
you couldn™t go through this, you couldn™t go through 
that. Then, of course, the fact that 
he could not have, I mean, my father could 
not have left the c
ountry without getting 
permission from the army. I mean, he was Œ 
they would activate you immediately, and he 

would have had to get a permit from the army, 
plus you had to get a permit all together to 
leave the country, I mean, which was a grea
t big do. People couldn™t just say, ﬁWell, 
tomorrow, I™m going to go to Vienna,ﬂ or some thing. You had to get a slew of 

documents, and permits, and who knows what, not to me ntion absolutely no money 

whatsoever.  
 

Q: You were not allowed to take money. 

 

A: You could not take a ny money out whatsoever, so what if not that? 

 

Q: Nothing. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
33 
 
A: Nothing, not that. Very little, I think it™s 
probably me ntioned in the passports how muc h. 
I™m not quite sure, but very little. So, the 
money, at one time, 
probably in 1941 probably, 
™40, ™41, my  father pro forma sold the big factory where, you know, also where the 
country house was to some  business friends. 
 

Q: And that™s Lj ubljana or not? 

 

A: No, no, no, this is the place 
is called Œ it™s near Za greb 
and the village or where the 
factory was is called Savski Marof, and that
 country house was called Janusevac, and he 
sold it to some  friends in Ljubljana, some  busin
ess friends in Ljubljana. In fact, I was just 
recently going through some  papers, I saw so
me  stuff about that. And through some body, 
I don™t know how, he got some  mo ney to Engl
and, to Switzerland, and 
a little bit to the 
United States. I don™t know how. 
 

Q: Now, you™re saying he sold the factory pro forma , what does that mean? 

 

A: That means that he- 

 

Q: Itappearstomean
 it™s not a real sale. 
 

A: It was a sale with a thing, you know, ﬁ When 
things calm down, I™ll have it back.ﬂ But he 
did get the money for it. 
 

Q: Hedid? 

 

A: Yes, he got a serious amount of mone
y, but oddly enough, he had taken a loan on my 
mother™s house which was very valuable, not
 so much as, you know, a historical house, 
but it was in the center of the center of town, 
and the land was very valuable, and he got a 
loan from the Œ he took a mortgage, that™s wh
at it is, a mortgage from the Zagreb Bank, 
the city bank, and was getting ready to send up money some how underground to the 

States or to Switzerland or 
whatever, probably to Switzer
land, but my mother said, 
ﬁListen, the president Œ I saw the president of 
the bank on the street, and he really didn™t 
greet me  with as muchﬂ, I hate to say defe
rence, but that was the meaning, ﬁas usual. 
Would you return that 
loan?ﬂ Which he did. 
 

Q: So, you knew that when you were Œ and you kne
w this at the time Œ that when you were 
leaving that there would be
 money in various places? 
 

A: Yes, but very little. I thought it was very l
ittle, and it was very litt
le, but it was enough to 
sort of survive. There wa s some
 in Switzerland; that I know.  
 

Q: You didn™t really Œ no, go ahead. 

 

A: Why and how it was done, I really don™
t know, but there was enough to survive. 
 

Q: Now how di d you, I me a n, did you pack? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
34 
 
 
A: Yes! 

 

Q: How did you do all this? 

 

A: Yes, the last month Œ okay, so we
 got this American visa which - 
 

Q: You wouldn™t have survived Œ let™
s describe about that and then - 
 

A: Yes, yes. The Counsel General of the United States Œ the consulate was the house next to 
ours in, I mean the office of the consulate, ne
xt to ours in Zagreb, the house. My father 
was a hunter. He took the Counsel General hunti
ng Œ it wasn™t even the Counsel General, 
it was a Counsel, Mr. Miley, an Ame r ican, 
nice mi ddle-class person. 
My father took him 
hunting. He, I don™t know, he saw in the back of
 our stable a Œ a suit 
of armor that was, 
you know, put away, nobody was bothering with. He 
went crazy with the suit of armor. 
My father gave him the suit of armor, wh
ich was cluttering things up, and I don™t know 
how authentic or Œ it was a suit 
of armor that probably was authentic, and he was very 
happy to give us a visa. Now, one reason 
why this was going on was there were Œ as 

nobody could leave Yugoslavia Œ quotas Œ you 
know, the visas were given by country 
quotas at the time Œ were not being used in Yugoslavia. So, you had ma ss es of quotas 

lying fallow in consulates, and it is very eas
y to get an immi gration visa. And when my  
father asked for the visa, and the man in
 the Counsel said, ﬁWhy don™t you take an 
immi gration visa? ﬂ  And, my father said, ﬁW
hat would I need an immi gr ation visa for?  
I™m going to return, obviously.ﬂ And, he sa id, ﬁOkay, you™ll return, but take this 

immi gration visa. You never know when it mi
ght be handy.ﬂ And we got an immi gration 
visa and that™s how it worked. Oh, and at one 
time, I guess, he did him a favor because he 
bought his Buick. He got a new Buick at the Counsel, and we got his Buick. 
 

Q: His old one? 

 

A: His old one. It wasn™t all th
at old, but it was certainly not 
for Yugoslavia, and he Œ this 
Buick was very significant, by the wa y, and 
he Œ so, you know, it was a friendship. It was 
a Œ for ma ybe a year and a half, two 
years, they were Œ they went - 
 

Q: It wasn™t some thing very recent? 

 

A: No, no, no, it was a long-term thing that was goi
ng on at that time , and he Œ yes, okay, we 
had that, but before that I was thinking we
 mi ght be going, and that we didn™t get the 
visa, but they talked about th
e visa probably a month before that. So, in town, in Zagreb, 
there were five or six trunks, you know
, like Œ steamers, huge steamer trucks. 
 

Q: In the house? 

 

A: In the house, all the servants were 
there including the na
nny, the present nanny, 
everybody was there. The dogs were there. There were three dogs running around in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
35 
 
town, not out in the country, and by the way, a
ll the furniture and so on from the country 
house was in the baseme nt of the house. 
 
Q: Of the house in Zagreb? 

 

A: In our house in Zagreb, yeah, that was taken out. When he sold the factory pro forma, he 
took Œ an uncle of my mother™s stayed in
 Janusevac, and was going to be running the 
factory. They didn™t do him in, but he stayed 
there. So, his furniture was there, but our 
furniture from the bedroom and stuff like th
at, that was in the baseme nt, taken by the 
Germans, by the way. Okay. And we were putting into these steamer trunks embroidered 

bed linen and tablecloths and stuff of that  kind, could you imagine why we needed that, 

and clothing, four-station 
clothing. This was Œ I mean, four-season, four-season clothing, 

all sorts of junk like that. A
nd then there were suitcases around, and this was all open 
standing, be ing filled, so that when the German
s came, they had all packed together, they 
just took it out. It™s amazing. 
 

Q: So, what did you all think?  That 
this would be shipped out some how?  
 

A: Yes, this would be shipped out. I mean, th
is is how this was going on with people who 
left three weeks earlier. There 
were people who left earlier. 
 

Q: So, what happened -? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Was you we re within days of the invasion? 
 
A: Yes, yes, yes, we were days within the 
invasion. So, this mus t  have been, let™s say, a 
week before the 27
th
 of March. That™s about it, but when this happened, and when 
Yugoslavia Œ they went in Belgrade , the 
populous starting spitting on the German flag. 
They took the car of the German a mbassador 
and knocked it over, a
nd then I think they 
put it on fire, and they were ye
lling all sorts of slogans: ﬁBe
tter dead than a slaveﬂ and 
that kind of stuff, and in Zagreb there was jubilation. 
 

Q: Because of this tri-pa rt 
agreement with, with German. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: March25
th
? 
 

A: That™s Œ yes, it was March 25
th
, and on the 27
th
 was the 
putsch
, yes, they abrogated Œ the 
people abrogated, and on the 28
th
, we  got into our car. We  left everything there. We  
packed suitcases. 
 

Q: So, you had some  little suitcases? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
36 
 
A: We had Œ they weren™t that little. There mu
st have been quite a few because when I think 
about what I dragged over like typewriters a
nd riding boots, necessary things of that kind, 
and urban coats. [laughs] 
 
Q: Urbancoats? 

 

A: An urban coat. 

 

Q: So, it was good it was a Buick with a big trunk. 

 

A: Yeah, and they were quite Œ yes, yes, I don™
t know big of a trunk. It was a very large car. 
It was very large. My parents Œ so, then, we
 had the American visa, but my father didn™t 
have the permission from the army to leave 
yet, nor did he have an exit visa for 
Yugoslavia, an exit permit from Yugoslavia. 
There™s a piece in the passport, there™s a 

Cyrillic thing that says ﬁOfficial Visaﬂ, and he
 Œ and he had to have written in that he was 
a delegate on the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry, otherwise he couldn™t have gotten 
out, but particularly not the army, because he would have been activated almost 

imme diately. So, we got into our 
car Œ my parents, my brother, I, my uncle Œ my father™s 
brother, who was a lawyer, Felix, and our driv
er who grew up in my father™s family. His 
name  was Josip Levac, who was part 
Volksdeutsche
, but that was Œ he was never anti-
Semitic or anything like th
at. His father was a cooper. He ma de barrels for my 
grandfather™s factory, and this ma n was school
ed by Œ my fa ther had him schooled and he 
went with us to Belgrade. We  went through my fa ther™s hometown, which was Slavonska 

Pozega, which was where this ma n was from 
also, and my father had to report to the 
barracks. As we drove into the town, we we
re stopped by the army, by some recruits, and 

one stuck the gun into the car, 
not with the bayonet, but just
 the muzzle of the gun, and he 
said, ﬁ
Legitimacija
ﬂ. We  gave him whatever, IDs and so on. So, I gave him my ID. M y 
father showed his army ID, said he was 
going to the headquarter
s there, I don™t know 
about the headquarters, but anyhow to the barr
acks because this is where he would have 

had to report to, and when he saw the pa
per, he called out, 
ﬁAnybody more literate 
around here? ﬂ  I™m sure he was illiterate, a
nd couldn™t read it. Okay, so, some body more 
literate came and he said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ So, we waited 
for my father in the car while he went to 

the barracks. I don™t know whether my uncle went along or not. I don™t think so, and 

Sepa, I think went to, the chauffer, went to 
talk to some body i n his family was left over 
there, and then we proceeded to Belgrade.  
 

Q: Excuse me , was there any doubt that
 your father would get permission? 
 

A: If they had felt that they wanted to 
be unpleasant, ma ybe he would have bribed 
some body. I  don™t know. I don™t know, but if they
 had wanted to be unpleasant, if he 
hadn™t had Œ he probably had some  other paper 
there that he showed them, that he was 
going to Belgrade to do some thing with Œ I can
™t imagine it any other way. He must have 
been, because it was very recently, he had just ve ry recently done this, you know, training 

in Split not so long ago. And, you know, he pr
obably would™ve survived because all the 
prisoners of war survived, almost all, and 
just as aside, a friend of ours who was a 
Serbian officer, by the way, who™s father was a 
general, his wife™s father was general, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
37 
 
and so on, was a prisoner of war in Germany, and 
he told me  that the Jewish prisoners of 
war and the Serbs and everybody were together 
and that one time , the Germans wanted to 
separate the Jewish prisoners of war from th
e others, and these people went on strike and 
called the Re d Cross and who knows what, and they
 left them together. And almost all of 
them survived. 
 
Q: What is the atmosphere in the car? 

 

A: Horrendous,awful. 

 

Q: Are you really frightened? 

 

A: Frightened, because you could see things we
re about to start. We were listening to the 
radio. There were mobilizations. There was 
army all over, you know, you could see army 
left and right as you went - 
 

Q: So, you were sure that the Germans - 

 

A: Oh, absolutely, absolutel
y, there was no doubt in our mi nd 
that some thing would happen. 
 

Q: Your one fear was that 
you wouldn™t get out soon enough. 

 

A: Absolutely, that was the fear. Plus we ha
d no visa to any country where we could have 
gone through. We  had- 
 

Q: You just had the visa- 
 
A: We had the Œ no, we had the immi gration 
visa Œ no! We  got Œ oh, yeah, we had the 
immi gration visa. That was it. That was it. 
 

Q: But, you had no way to traverse - 

 

A: We had no other, no way to tr
averse. I think, if I look in the 
passport, that all of this was 
obtained in Belgrade, the various consulate 
and embassies and so on. So, when we came  
to Belgrade, fi rst of all, we had the permi
ssion fr om the army , then they wrote in this 

delegation thing that he was 
going as a delegate of the Mi
nistry. Otherwise would have 
not been able to get there. And we all got th
ese official visas, because you didn™t just get 
a visa. You got an official visa. I know that
 my uncle Œ my uncle, I think had an affair 
with the pr ime mi nister™s Œ the prime mi niste
r™s wife. He was all over the place. He was a 
very, a popular guy, and had genera
lly all sorts of connections. 
He was divorced first. He 
was a likeable, nice guy who had connections
, and I think he helped some how hasten 
things. We  spent one horrendous night. Therewere two other me mbers of the family, one 

or two Œ my aunt™s husband was also a lawy
er who was a businessman, who was there in 

Belgrade and I don™t know w
hy, and some body else. And at th
e very last mi nute, we 
found that there was an industrial or some  ki
nd of fair, either industrial fair or an 
agricultural fair or something like that  in
 Budapest, and they 
were giving visas. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
38 
 
 
Q: To be able to go? 

 

A: To be able to go, and this was the only
 Œ this was the only Œ the only place, the only 
border you could cross. You couldn™t go anywhe
re else. The Germans we re in Greece 

already, couldn™t go through Bulgaria, coul
dn™t go through Italy, couldn™t go through 
Austria via Slovenia. This was the only way 
to go, and this wa s some  kind of probably 
excursion visa, I™m not quite sure, but they we
re giving these visas be
ca use there was this 
fair. We  spe nt the night in Belgrade, and 
the next morning Œ naturally Yugoslavia was 
completed mobilized by that time Œ and decide
d that the chauffer would help us with the 
cars and go with us to the Hungari
an border, and then be able 
to report back to the family 
whether we crossed or not. And in the tr
ain, my father wrote out an affidavit or 
something and said to the chauffer, who cl
early was a me mber of the family, ﬁYou will 
need to take care of your fa mily. Use this ca
r as a taxi or whatever you want.ﬂ And he 
gave him all the papers, and th
e piece of paper and 
the letter in which he said that he 
should take this car, which he did. [laughs
] And the very first week, Artukovic, the 

Croatian mi nister of the interior became , 
I mean, he became his driver. The car was 
requisi tioned and he beca me  his driver, and stay
ed with him until the very last, and didn™t 
tell him that he was fleeing, and this poor
 guy was caught by the British, and Artukovic 
took off to Argentina and finally ended up here. 
 

Q: So, he - 

 

A: He gets us- 

 

Q: To the train? 
 
A: To the Œ no, he gets us to the train, and he
 goes with us to the bor
der, to the Hungarian 
border on the train. 
 

Q: To say that the fa mily- 

 

A: That we crossed, yes. At that time, there we
re German soldiers in the trai n Œ offi cers and 
soldiers in the train already going towa
rds Belgrade. There were troop trains. 
 

Q: You mean in the train 
station, not in your train? 
 

A: No, no, in the train station in Belgrade, this 
was total chaos, and there were recruits with 
peasants with their wives sitting on packages
. I mean, you c ould hardly ma ke a step. It 
was total complete chaos. This was the mobilized peasantry that was going to be fighting 

the Germans, all over the Belgrade station. N
o, he went Œ he left us on the Hungarian 
border, when the train, just before the train 
crossed to Hungary. Now, there were German 
officers on the train already going Œ I don™t know 
where they were going Œ but there were 
German offi cers in jackets and everything going up and down in the train, but the war 

had not been declared yet, and troop trai
ns going in the other direction towards 
Yugoslavia. And we arrived in Budapest, got
 into a nice hotel, 
and phoned Belgrade and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
39 
 
told them, ﬁWe™re here.ﬂ Meanwhile, tried to
 find out where other me mbers of the family 
were, the ones who were in Zagreb. Some  
were getting ready to go to Dubrovnik, which 
they knew was going to be, if anything happene
d, it would be Italia
n, but they were not 
there yet. Other me mber s of the family stayed
 in Belgrade, and we talked to them when 
we got to Switzerland. That night, ma ybe
 six hours later, they were bombed. 
 
Q: But, they woul
dn™t listen to you? 
 

A: No, no, no. They thought that we were- 

 

Q: They thought you were crazy. 

 

A: They thought we were Œ we ca
lled them from Budapest and we
 said, ﬁListen, this is what 
we saw.ﬂ And they said, ﬁYou™re so in pa
nic among us. Leave us alone.ﬂ And so on, and 
the same  thing they said when we called 
them from Switzerland at mi dnight, and they 
were bombe d six hours later. 
 

Q: When you got to Budapest, you did no
t have papers for the next stage? 
 

A: I think we had. 

 

Q: Youhad? 

 

A: I think Œ I can look in the passport because 
I™m thinking there are some  Œ we went and we 
stayed two nights. We  went to Vienna overnight
, and those we re not so hard to get. There 
were transit visas to, I think 
that they, I don™t know whether th
ey still called it Austria, 
probably Germany. It was Germany a l ready, and 
we came in the mi ddle of the night, and 
we got to some  kind of dreadful hotel near the railroad station. I 
know that they stole a 
suitcase of my brother™s, and imme diately at
 dawn, we got on the train to Switzerland, 
but did not ma ke it to cross. We  had to spend a night in Germany. 
 

Q: And your father was interrogated? 

 

A: And my father was 
interrogated for hours. 
 

Q: And this is at an inn that you™re staying in? 

 

A: This is at  an inn in 
Austria, right on the border. 
 

Q: And were there Germans in that Inn? 

 

A: There were Germans, German troops, and Ge
rman officers in that inn, and they were 
singing one of those lovely war songs about 
Prince Eugene, that™s a boy, I guess, going to 
Belgrade conquering Belgrade. It™s a ma rch s
ong. It™s a ma rch that we all knew, and it™s 

part of Œ I™m trying to think in
 which one of the classic Œ it™s
 part of a classic composition 
this is taken from. It™s like a ma rch. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
40 
 
 
Q: Was your father brutalized? 

 

A: Not at all. He was questioned for a long 
time, very thoroughly, and as his German was 
very good, I guess that was part of the thing. 
He said, ﬁWe are immi grating to the United 
States, please. Here™s my immi gration visa.ﬂ
 The war wasn™t on yet, but I was a very 

thorough in- And my brother and my mother a
nd I were sitting in this inn absolutely 
quaking with fear. It went on for hours. 
 

Q: And he was in the inn? 

 

A: Some where in the inn. They took him in th
e room, a bunch of Ger man officers who came 
and knocked on the door when, you know, in the 
mi ddle of the night. The way it was, my 

mother and I slept in one room. 
He and my brother slept in the other. So, he came to tell 
us, and then my brother joined us 
in this room and we waited there. 
 

Q: Okay, let™s change the tape. 

 

End of Tape #4 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471

Tape #5 
 
Q: So, was your father Œ we were talk
ing about your fathe
r™s interrogation. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Was he interrogated all night? 

 

A: No, but some three hours at least. 

 

Q: So, it must have been just horrible for you. 

 

A: It was horrendous. We  were terrified, and by 
that time , we had see 
these troops going. By 
the way, Vienna, when we got there, was bl
acked out, and the windows were blacked out 
in the hotel, and so on. There was no light 
whatsoever. I don™t know
 how we Œ it must 
have been fairly close, this 
hotel, to the station because I ha
ve a feeling we  walked there 
in the dark. We ca me  at night and we  left 
at dawn, and I reme mber just darkness, and 
then Œ a blackout, a plain blackout. 
 

Q: Where was your Uncle Felix?  
Did he stay in Belgrade? 
 

A: At that time, he was in Belgrade, yes. 

 

Q: So, he didn™t go with you? 

 

A: No, no, no, he just Œ he was in Be
lgrade, and he stayed in Belgrade. 
 

Q: And having this–relationship–? 

 

A: Yeah, probably just visiti
ng around. I recently found Œ two days ago, three days ago Œ an 
incredible letter writ
ten by the person who was the Uruguayan Consul General who was a 
friend of his and he tells of 
this story of how he a nd a c
ouple of others were fleeing, and 
my Uncle Felix was al ready in It alian territory
 going back because of some  love interest 
or some thing like that, to Zagreb, 
and how they were jailed and so on. 
 

Q: Did Felix survive?  

 

A: Yes, he survived. He went Œ he went Œ he rema rried. He went Œ why he came to the 
United States via Cuba, but first on so me  ki
nd of Ellis Island, Cuba
n Ellis Island where 
he spent, it was several months before 
they would let them out, but he did. 
 

Q: Before we get to Geneva, where you stayed for about a month- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
42 
 
Q: I™m going to ask what™s going to sound lik
e a funny Œ what happened to the dogs?  You 
had three dogs. 
 
A: I have absolutely no idea. Everybody, the w
hole staff was in the house. There was a cook. 
There was a Œ two ma ids, the nanny. 
 

Q: They were all in the house? 

 

A: They were all in the apartment in
 Zagreb. They weren™t even, you know - 
 

Q: So, you assume  they took care of the dogs. Maybe. 

 

A: I hope so. 

 

Q: You hope so. 

 

A: Yeah, ma ybe it was Sepa, ma ybe the chauffe
r did. No, I hadn™t heard anything. I had no 
idea what happened. I have no idea. There we
re two Dachshunds and an English Setter I 
brought in the apartment. 
 

Q: I was a little concerned because - 

 

A: Oh, I was very concerned. I was very con
cerned. Some body must have taken them in. I 
mean there were other people there who mi
ght have taken them. Some body who was a 
hunter would have taken them. He was a very
 bad hunting dog, but he looked as if he 
could do it. 
 

Q: Was it easy to get into Switzerland? There was no problem? 

 

A: There was a lot of frisking a
nd stuff like that, quite serious. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yes, and probably interrogation. 

 

Q: Probablyinterrogation? 

 

A: Interr ogationalso. 

 

Q: But you didn™t experience this. 

 

A: No, no, no. 

 

Q: It would™ve been your father? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
43 
 
A: My father and probably my mother. I think 
they Œ I think they s
earched her in various 
ma nners. 
 
Q: Did they search you? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Amazingly no.  

 

Q: Because you™re not a kid. 

 

A: I™m not a kid. Nobody touched me , but my
 mother was searched, both in Spain- 
 

Q: And in Switzerland? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And how about Mario? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: But,he™s- 

 

A: My mother was very embarrassed. 
 
Q: Oh I imagine. Do you begin in Switzer
land, once you get through 
this interrogation- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And you stay for a month in Geneva- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Are you feeling a little bit more secure? 

 

A: Yes, yes, but not completely because, I 
mean, no. Our visa Œ our permit to be in 
Switzerland would™ve run out af
ter amonth. We  would™ve had 
to leave. Maybe it would 
have been possible to prolong it somehow, 
but I don™t reme mber how long our permit 
was in Switzerland, but I Œ 
no, it was important to get going. Pl us, the other visas 
would™ve run out. 
 

Q: So, you didn™t Œ you were in Geneva because you
r father was trying to get the next set of 
papers, or–? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
44 
 
A: We were in Geneva. We ll, first of all, we
 had to get a French visa. We  had to go through 
occupied France which was in a car, which was locked, sealed. It was a sealed car.  
 
Q: A sealed train car? 

 

A: A sealed train car, yeah. 

 

Q: By the way, what was it like in Geneva for that month? 

 

A: We were in a very nice hotel. We  were in 
the Hotel d™ Anglet erre 
which was lovely, but it 
was very tense. It was extremely tense. 
 

Q: So, here your father had some  money. 

 

A: Yes, and there were some  people who we knew in Switzerland who had left earlier, who 
were in the lumber business, and I don™t know
 what kind of nationality they had, possibly 
they had some  other nationality, not Yugoslav. 
They were there. My mother™s cousin who 
was this Baroness de Vateville, who was in
 Œ who lived in Lucerne at the time, my 
mother called her and she came to Geneva in a wo men™s Swiss Auxiliary uniform 

speaking Switzer Dietch. It was very funny to
 hear, but was very helpful. She came and 
offered to help in any way. I don™t 
know what kind of help it was.  
 

Q: Phonecalls? 

 

A: I forgot, naturally. The night
 that we  arrive and called Be
lgrade at mi dnight of April 5
th
 
or 6
th
 and speak to the family, and they say ev
erything is quiet, we  shouldn™t be crazy. 
Six hours after that they were bombe d. This wa
s the first time that I saw my father cry. 
When the whole army, everything, collapsed 
right away. There was no more Yugoslavia. 
I mean, this was such a Blitzkr ieg there that th
is all went to pi eces and was really in bad 
shape. I was very happy I was going to go to wher
ever Œ India, or Œ I didn™t want to have 
anything to do with that anym
ore. I wanted out. My mother was very sad, but I don™t 
think she cried, but my father 
actually cried, and then the next
 thing he did, he went to 
Bern to talk to the representative of 
Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do. I mean, it 
was completely unclear what, you know, what
 was going to happen to Cr oatia. Not 
Croatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one 
way or another. It was still Yugoslavi a, 
completely falling apart, and there was ve
ry little news except the bombing Belgrade, 

nothing else. And, then later on, we found out
, when we went on, we saw what was 
happening. When an independent Croatia was de
clared, but that was later. We  went on 
this sealed train, came to Spain, and at first Œ 
this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil 
War Œ we stayed in a very nice hotel, but 
it was very obvious that this wa s very obvious 
that this was a country that
 had gone through a wa r, and it was completely obvious. Crazy 
thing, here we want to go to the Prado, firs
t time we were in Spain, but the Prado is 

closed. So, we go sit in a café to have break
fast and there™s some  
rolls, but it™s obvious 

that there was a war. I mean, it looked sha
bby, and then children 
without limbs started 
comi ng to the window of this café and we™re sitting there having food and asking for 

food. This was the first time I had seen a count
ry Œ I mean, this was a very short time  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
45 
 
after the civil war in Spain,and these children Œ this was 
the saddest thing about war Œ 
without an arm or without a leg, just holdi
ng their hands up, and emaciated, and so we 
took all the food and gave it to them and wa
lked away. You couldn™
t sit and eat because 
of what was going on. We sat pretty much, a
nd walked around a little bit through Madrid, 

but it was very sad, and it was very empty, 
and it was very obvious that they had gone 
through a wa r. Then we went to Barcelona a
nd spent a couple of ni
ghts in Barcelona and 
we got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very 

much aware of things are falling out because 
we didn™t go to a very fancy hotel. We went 
to some  kind of pension. It was very nice,
 but it wasn™t a palace hotel in any place. 
 

Q: Now, are you at all feeling a certain ki
nd of ambi valence? On one hand, happy getting 
out- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And on the other hand, a certain kind of sadness? 

 

A: Totally, totally, and also you 
had this feeling in Li sbon, Portugal that this is the spy 
capital of the world. It wa s very Œ it was 
eerie. You didn™t know who you could talk to. 
People would approach you and say, ﬁI™m 
going to get you a prolongation of your visa. 
Are you interested? You™re going to get a ticket
 on such-and-such a sh
ip to go hither and 
yon.ﬂ It was bad. And we walked around, but it 
wa s a beautiful town we had never been 
to. In Lisbon, we walked around. I have pictur
es of all dressed up in suits and hats and 
the works. 
 

Q: So, you have all your luggage. 
 
A: All the luggage, all of that is standing
 around, yeah. We ™re weari
ng spring suits. I think 
there™s even a pictur e of my mother with a 
fur boa or some thing like that, a dead fox on 
her. I think so. I™m al most cer
tain. And my brother and I walk
ing there. There were really 
some  quite unsavory characters that would come
 and ask him, and they™d be helpful in 
the hotels and everything. But we then 
started doing some  traveling around, and you 
know, and first of all, we had Œ okay, th
e United States ma ritime union was having a 
strike. So, United States™ ships were not 
going anywhere, and we had reservations on 
some  sort of ship, but ___ American export. 
Nothing was else was goi
ng on in the rest of 
the country, I mean, the rest of Europe excep
t for Portugal was at war. So, there were no 
neutral things except Portugal and, I guess, th
e United States that 
had ships going back 
and forth to the States. So, there was this ma
ritime strike, and we had to stay longer, and 
there was danger of, again, our 
Portuguese visa running out.  
 

Q: So, you™re there for how long?  Days?  Weeks? 

 

A: I don™t Œ three weeks. 

 

Q: Threeweeks?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471

A: Not ma ny. So, my father goes to the cons
ulate or whatever, whatever the Yugoslav 
representation there is, 
and the poor person who is in charge
 of it, first of all, whoever 
was a Croatian employee quit and went to fr
ee Croatia, or thought they we re Œ anyhow, 
they quit the Yugoslav Consulate, but there 
still the Yugoslav Cons
ulate. There was a Œ 
what is the insurrection of sailors
 called, there™s a word for it? 
 
Q: That™s right. It™s a mutiny. 

 

A: Mutiny. There™s a mutiny on Croatian ships th
at are in the harbor in Li sbon because, 
naturally, the sailors are Croats
. They™re not Serbs. So, these are all Dalmatian Serbs. By 
that time, there™s a Œ those Ustashes have got
ten to Zagreb, and it™s 
obvious what™s going 

to be in Zagreb. So, they went back. They we
nt with their ships. So, this poor person has 
nobody to talk to because, obviously, ther
e™s not Œ no connection, no telephone, no 

nothing to Yugoslavia, or ex-Yugoslavia, and 
so he™s having this conversation with my 
father. What can he do with this mutiny?  This
 mu tiny?  And my father said, ﬁLet them go. 
What are you going to do with them?  You can
™t hold them there.ﬂ So, he said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ 
So, they took off. The next thing - 
 

Q: Not with the ship? 

 

A: With the ship. They took ever
ything and went back to Croatia. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: As far as I know. I mean, this is Œ this 
is the way it was decided. They were taking the 
ship, and they were Œ there were a couple of 
them, I think. I™m not quite sure. Then, they 
had no money to pay whoever was employed there. No money from Yugoslavia. I don™t 

know what happened to the rest. So, my father 
lent him, I think, $500 to pay off the staff. 
There was some  Croats in the staff, no doubt, 
but most of them wanted to go back. For all 
I know, he was a Croat, but ma ybe not. 
 

Q: But your father is known enough so these people know- 

 

A: No, he goes Œ he walks in and he™s go
t an official visa in hi s pocket, and- 
 

Q: Of course, he™s a representative 
of the transpor t a
nd commerce, right? 
 

A: Yes, yeah, yeah. And so, they have a conversa
tion. So, he gives Œ and I have the receipt. I 
recently found it under the papers. 
It was little. I think it™s $5
00, plus a letter which asks 
that we take along when we get to the ship, 
a Œ we ll, when we get transportation, to take 
along a Persian carpet for the representative 
of Yugoslavia in Wash
ington, D.C., who was 
a guy by the name  of Pr otasce (ph) at the tim
e, which I think I saw on one occasion when 
there still wa s a Yugoslavia, which we t
ook along. Then, we found somebody who got in 
touch with us, a family of a French dipl
omat. I guess it was a small place, and people 
heard who was where, or ma ybe this Yugos
lav woma n who I™m going to talk to you 
about now heard that Œ must have gone
 to the Yugoslav Embassy or Yugoslav 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
47 
 
Representation to talk about what™s going to 
happen to her, and so on. She was ma rried to 
a, I think, the cultural 
attaché of France in Portugal, a
nd he wa s supposed to go back to 
France, and they had a little boy. She was or
iginally from Zagreb, and her sister™s 
husband worked for my father in the yeast f
actory, the alcohol and yeast factory. And in 
fact, I was wearing a jacket that her sister, 
who was a weaver, had woven the ma terial for. 
I used that for a long time . And we took this
 child, and took it to hi
s godparents who were 
a Yugoslav Œ a Croatian Jew by 
the name of Alexander and 
his Russian non-Jewish wife 
who were in New York already for a year. 
 
Q: So, you had added- 

 

A: We added some , so then there were- 

 

Q: Five of you? 

 

A: Five of us in the cabin plus the rug, ma ybe not the rug. It ma y have been some where else. 

 

Q: So, this SS Sibornay was the ship– 

 

A: Sibonay,yes. 

 

Q: And what country is the ship from?  

 

A: US, US Export Line. The strike was over. 

 

Q: It was over? 
 
A: The strike was over 

 

Q: And that was the original ship you we re supposed to go on? 

 

A: I don™t know, but it was probably a United St
ates export line ship because they were 
doing this traverse. It was full 
of all sorts of flotsam and jetsam from Eur ope on the ship, 

and then the consul from Pavelic, from Bern
 and his American wife were also on the 
ship. They came  later. I mean, they came to Portugal later. So, we had somebody to have, 

to sit at the table with. When we got to Be
rmuda, it was quite, I mean, there were German 

U-boats there, and they were trying to a
void the U-boats, but the United States was 
neutral. So, we got to Bermuda. The Britis
h got on the ship and took off a bunch of 
people. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah, German spies, they said, and so on, ma ybe 10, 15.  

 

Q: How ma ny people are on the ship with you? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
48 
 
A: I don™t know. I really don™t know. It was a 
big ocean liner, and there was interrogation 
then. The British looked at al
l of our passports and so on, but there was no problem 
whatsoever. They took off a number of peopl
e. Some , probably, were perfectly honest, 
decent people. In fact, one was a German leftist, who then found us in New York. So, 
they must have obviously let him go. 
 

Q: Now, was the route to go to Bermuda , or they went to- 

 

A: No, no, I think it was Œ I think it was Œ 
no, they were avoiding probably. I don™t know, 
because the only thing that happened in Be
rmuda is that  these Œ that these British 
offi cers- 
 

Q: Interrogatedpeople. 

 

A: Yeah, boarded and interrogated people. A
nd, then, it wasn™t there too long, two hours. 
 

Q: I see, and then- 

 

A: And then directly in New Jersey, Hoboken, I believe. 

 

Q: Hoboken? 

 

A: I believe so, but de
finitely New Jersey. 
 

Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty? 

 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: You did?  Was that great? 

 

A: It was grea t, and we did not go to any Ellis
 Island or anythi ng like that. United Stat es 
immi gration people came on board, and inte
rrogated us on board, as I reme mber. 
 

Q: So, you disembark? 

 

A: We disemba r ked in New Jersey, got into a ta
xi, and went into the tunnel, which was very 
impressive to go through, and my father 
was saying, ﬁThis is under the Hudson which 
we™re going now.ﬂ It was very exciting. We  went to 57
th
 Street and 6
th
 Avenue to the 
Hotel Salisbury, where they had sort of apartments, small, you know. 
 

Q: They had an apartment already? 

 

A: No, they didn™t. Actually, yes, because  
my uncle™s divorced wife had ma rried a Czech 
who was a schoolma te of hers, and they were 
in the hotel next door, which is some thing 
called the, next door also on 57
th
 Street, some thing like Œ not the Berkshire, but 
some thing like that. Also, on 57
th
 Street between 6
th
 and 7
th
 Avenue. There was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
49 
 
wonderful automa t, Horn and Hardart, wher
e you could put money in and you could get 
coffee or cocoa and it would go into a cup from out of the wall. 
 
Q: Could you imagine trying to do this without money? 

 

A: No. Maybe yes, up to Œ yes, but with a lo
t of difficulty, probably no Hotel d™Angleterres 
in Geneva and- 
 

Q: But, your father was also prominent enough that he knew people and he could get a 
certain recourse that mo
st people couldn™t get. 
 

A: Yes, yes, sure. A lot of Œ of course, ther
e were a lot of people in
cluding very good friends 
of ours who had children already outside the c
ountry. This is a rath
er interesting thing. 
This was a very prominent Jewish family. In f
act, at one time , the father was the head of 
the Jewish community in Zagreb, and he ha
d two daughters living in
 South Carolina, in 
Dillon, South Carolina, planted paprika. 
 

Q: Paprika? 

 

A: Paprika, because you couldn™t get any papr
ika from Hungary anymore so this was the 
business, and they had gone a year earlie
r to the United States
 to find out what, you 
know, where paprika could be Œ what would be 
the best land and climate for paprika and 
that was Dillon, South Carolina, and they ha
d a paprika plantation, believe it or not. And 
these parents Œ although, my father went to 
before we left, and they had two daughters 
and fa mily, they could™ve easily come along. 
People were afraid. These people could™ve 
done it, and other people th
at I know could have easily
 done it, and thought, ﬁOh, no, 
we™ll get out.ﬂ So, it was quite
 strange how this functioned. 
More people definitely could 
have helped themselves. I™m not saying 
young people who had no money, but there were 
very prominent Jewish and non-Jewish fa milies that could™ ve done it. 
 

Q: Was it easy for you to adju
st to the United States? 
 

A: I think it was in the beginning. Later on, no. 

 

Q: Later on, no? 

 

A: Later on I became Œ at first, you know, we™re
 in a hotel that had a kitchenette and a 
closet. We  t hought this was absolutely wonderf
ul. We  went to a five and ten and bought Œ 
my brother and I went to buy things wit
h, you know, with flowers on it, for heaven™s 
sakes, mugs with flowers. We ™d never seen it
. I thought this was terr
ific, like four spoons 
and so on. And then my father decided befo
re we moved Œ we  then moved later on to 

Riverdale, in New York, and my brother went
 to school there for so
me  time. Fieldstone 
School, I think it was call
ed. He bought a car.  
 

Q: Mario? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
50 
 
A: No, my father bought a car. N
o, Mario, the first summer, was  se
nt to camp in Maine, and 
we bought a car and got a chauffer, 
and traveled through New England. 
 
Q: Fabulous. 

 

A: That was fabulous, and then
 finally when we came back we took apartment. But I 
reme mber buying the car and having to pay 
cash because our, whatever account we had, 
bank account was blocked because we  were aliens probably. 
 

Q: You™re illega l aliens? 

 

A: I think so, for a little bit.  

 

Q: When is your brother Œ 
we have to stop the tape. 
 

End of Tape #5 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
51 
 
Tape #6 
 
Q: You ca me  to the United States in 
1941. Did you get here in May or June? 
 

A: May. 

 

Q: Now, your brotheris still at home. 

 

A: Oh, wait a mi nute, I™m trying to think, I th
ink it would have been early June or May, 
ma ybe like you know the ma nifest is there. We  can see it. 
 

Q: Is your brother Œ does he volunteer to go into the army?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: But are you US citizens? 

 

A: No, but he became as soon as he joined the army, almost immediately. 

 

Q: Was your family wanting him to, or was it okay? 

 

A: It was obvious that they we
re going to recruit him anyhow. 
 

Q: Even as a foreigner? 

 

A: Yes, and at the time when he got him, he 
was told to change his name . He was going to 
be sort of an interpreter, 
but never wa s anything. He died 
in, near Sainte-Mère-Eglise, 
which was horrible battle in Normandy. He wa
s in Texas and New Jersey and so on, is 
where he got his basic training, 
and it Œ whoever his officer wa
s said, ﬁListen, it would be 
a good idea if you changed your name because they
 can find out this way. It won™t be so 
obvious right away.ﬂ And he did, and then my
 uncle changed his name  also, Felix to 
Sorel. And I don™t know why because this na me , what™s not clear to me  is because when I 

was doing the broadcasting to Yugoslavia, so
rt of a women™s program, whether I first 

used Sorel, whether my brother first used 
Sorel, I don™t reme mber. It was one way like 
that, except all my friends who h
eard knew Œ it was in Yugoslavia. 
 

Q: And, when did you get the 
job with Voice of America? 
 

A: That was a fairly interesting thing. There 
was no Voice of America when I joined. It was 
some thing that was sort of a precursor of O
SS, a nd there was some thing called, I believe, 
the analysis section, and I looked at the pape
rs, and I think it was 
™43 ma ybe, and I was 
doing some  research in Œ language research Œ 
at the library in New York, and then there 
was a Balkan desk where, again, I wasn™t
 doing much. I was doing translations and 
nothing much. Then, this guy that I told you 
that was doing the broadcasting from Paris 
originally, wa s doing broadcasting in Œ it wasn™t
 even Voice of America, I think it was 
still part of Coordinated Information, if I™m 
not mi staken, is what it was called. But they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
52 
 
had broadcasting facilities. So, from the same
 place where Voice of America was, he was 
broadcasting there, and I was transl ating it into
 English for the censor
s. Then, the ma n got 
sick, and I wa s the one who was broadcasting, 
and I had to end the Œ I said who I was 
because they knew who he was and so on, and 
I said I was broadcasting in his name , and 
it ended up, ﬁMay God save King Peter foreve
r. May God save forever King Peter of 
Yugoslavia.ﬂ _____ This was for about six weeks or
 so, I believe, I was doing it, and then 
finally some thing like the Balkan desk wa
s established which was under Œ the chief was 
an Albanian, of all things, then there was 
some  Greeks who had been Œ they were been 
shuttled back and forth, and I don™t think that
 we actually broadcast as Voice of America 
in Serbo-Croatian until ™44 probably, and so that™s that. 
 

Q: So, are you doing this work at the same
 ti me that Mario went into the army? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And, how did you Œ when did you and your pare
nts hear about this?  Wa s it soon after the 
___? 
 

A: Very soon. My mother was at home  al
one, and a We stern Union person came  in. 
 

Q: WesternUnion? 

 

A: Western Union came with a telegram, and I reme mber I was at the hairdresser after work, 
and I called to say, ﬁI™m comi ng home. I™m
 sorry, do you need anything along the way? ﬂ 
Then we were living on 102
nd
 and Riverside Drive, and she 
said, ﬁThis ma n just handed 
this.ﬂ So, my father was in the mustard 
business in Brooklyn, and Œ which was quite a 
strange thing, and he came  home. It was ho
rrendous. It was horrendous. I can™t tell you 
how horrendous. On the other hand, it was 
happening all over. There were several 
fa milies, fr iends of ours, who had lost, in the States, sons. So, it was in the mi ddle of this 

whole dreadful trauma  for everybody. We  weren™
t the one that was pi
cked out as the only 
one to live through, you know, badly. The traini
ng that they had, I don™t even know how 
long the basic training wa s, and he was in Germany Œ in Britain for a while, and he wrote 

a letter that ma de us know 
where he was, and he™s buried in Saint-Laurent, you know, 
that bi g cemetery. 
 

Q: Have you gone? 

 

A: Oh, several times. I went, the first time I 
went there, it was still only wooden ma rkers, no 
Mogen David there, and then there wa s one Br
itish person who was an admi nistrator, and 
then of course, it went  on to became this super, huge, enormo us cemetery which has lost 

some . I me a n, in a way that more mo ving a
nd impressive, and in another way, it™s less, 
because this was, so to speak, raw earth, just
 lines and lines of wooden crosses, and with 
name s on them, that™s all there was. And then 
we lived in France in the ™60s. So, we went 
several time s. This was a decision my parent
s ma de, especially my father. He said, ﬁYou 
know this will be a grave that will be taking 
care of. It will not depend on whether you™re 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
53 
 
paying some  kind of duty, or some body should be
 there to watch this.ﬂ And I think it was 
a very good decision. 
 
Q: Rather than bringing him home . 

 

A: Yes, because  friends of ours did, and that was be tter for them, and I also have a feeling 
ma ybe my father wanted to save my mother 
mor e  trauma . I think my mother was closer 
to my brother, then Œ not closer to him th
an to me. In a way, I think, she was closer 
because we were wome n, but this was the ca
rrier of the name. S
o, that counted, and it 
was an extremely macho society, Yugoslavi
a, not only, I mean, for everybody, for all 
people, for all Jews and for everyone, Serbians. 
 

Q: So, in some  ways he was more impor tant? 

 

A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think ma ybe I was clos
er to my father. All together, he was, and 
it™s crazy to say ﬁma ma™ s boyﬂ, because that™s 
not, you know, in that sense, but I think he 
was more Œ I think he was independent. I 
don™t know, maybe because I was older. I have 

no idea. Maybe, because he was better looking than me . He was very good looking 

person, and I was, for a while there, a very
 thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and 
that kind of thing. He was a good looking young 
ma n. So, I think Œ for a child, and they 
fed him well, and he got round, and I was al
ways scrawny at that time . So, you know. I 

think that may have been part of it. And 
Yugoslavia was a country where wome n wa lked 
behind the donkey while their husbands rode. 
I won™t say in our so
ciety, but underlying 
that. It carries over. 
 

Q: Did it affect your father
 the way it did your mother? 
 

A: I think it affected my Œ my father was a so
ldier through four years 
or more, and he knew 
of the horrible possibility existed, and I mea
n, he didn™t sit in an office during World War 
I. He was in the Russian front among ____ 
going on, this, that and the other came out. 
And, horrible as it is, I think in a way it ma y ha
ve been an interesting experience for him. 
He told a story which has nothing to do with th
is, but I just want to me ntion it. When he 
got Œ I guess this must have been on the Russi
an/Polish border some wher e, he said that a 

ma n ca me  to him who was in the Russian ar
my a nd surrendered, and said that I™m Jew 
soldier (ph), and so he -my father took him 
home to Pozega along with his horse, and the 
ma n stayed I don™t know how long with the family as a prisoner of war. So, he was in a 

nice regime nt, hunter™s regime
nt with nice uniforms, and so on. Although, he was in 
trenches, and he knew how horribl
e Œ I think it™s a different e
xperience to them than to 
us. 
 

Q: So, when did you hear about Joseph? 

 

A: He was mi ssing in action for more than a 
year, the poor soul. We kept writing to each 
other, and suddenly there was no, nothing anymore. 
 

Q: He was writing to you- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
54 
 
 
A: I was in New York. We  were in New Yor
k. We  were writing practically daily in New 
York, and there was no answer, and then fina
lly, the mother wrote me , and his insurance 
policy was written for me , which I find incred
ible, I mean, they needed it probably less 
than we did. Maybe he felt I was here, the 
poor refugee sitting in New York, which was 
true, but he ma de it out to me , and the moth
er heard Œ no, first he was mi ssing in action 
from both of us were writing back and fort
h. Finally, my parents were sending food to 

England to her because she was in horribl e 
shape at the time. She married a Colonel 
Enzeing (ph) of all name s, and his brother, 
they couldn™t find him, his brother. He was 
mi ssing in action. His brother we
nt to look for him, in Bur ma, and they recognized him 

by his boots a year later in the jungle. This was 
Œ my brother™s death and all of that was at 
the same time, at about the same time. It was about the same time. For a year, more than 

a year, he was mi ssing in action, and something called the Duke of Wellington™s 

regiment, and this is al
so bizarre to think of. 
 

Q: And, when the war was over, we
re there any relatives alive? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: InZagreb? 

 

A: In Zagreb, or in Croatia, fa
r off. Some came back. Some  were in camps in Italy. Others 
had gotten from Italy to Latin America. Here™s
 another very, very interesting thing about 
Œ they were helped by a group of mo nks, not
 mo nks, but religious, an order that was 
called San Rafaele, that was for med to help
 refugees. They help Jews. They helped 
Ustashe. They helped Ge rmans. They help
ed everyone. That was their job, and these 
people took their passports to Za greb. The 
Uruguayan consul had le
ft who was Jewish, 
and was fleeing, and this is the le
tter I just found of eight pages,
 left the official seal with 
his secretary and this order carried the passpor
ts to Zagreb under their robes, had them 
stamped, brought them back to Rome, because th ey had these, they were given exit visas 

from Italy and transit visas from Spain. Th
at was my father™s sister, husband, daughter 
and then the young ma n that she fell in love wi
th and they finally ma rried, and my unc le 
Felix some how went to Cuba, where he satin a sort of a holding camp because I guess 

they didn™t feel like letting people out or
 couldn™t get enough m
oney out of them. He  
finally came to the States, and actua lly my fath
er visited him and he 
had a Cuban visa at 
that time, in ™44 or ™45. I th
ink it™s stamped in his passpor
t, and then finally Felix got 
ma rried to an Italian Jewish woma n who wa
s a scientist, and then they ended up in 
Caracas, Venezuela.  
 

Q: Is there anything more you™d like to tell
 us about your experiences?  I know you have a 
full life afterwards which we can™t go into now. 
 

A: No, of course. A wonderful husband who I me
t. He was working in Belgrade Œ actually, 
it was not Voice of America, it was the United 
States Information Agency, he established 
the offi ce for them in Belgrade. Before that
, he wa s an Albania during the war Œ Italy, 

Albania and so on, and we me t at Voice of 
America. He came  back to tell us how we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0471  
55 
 
were getting, you know, how we were accepted and heard and so on. And we got 
ma rried. We  have two daughters. We ™ve lived 
all over the place. We  lived in Venezuela 
for I don™t know how many year
s, six ma ybe, seven. Then, we came ba ck to New York. 
We went to Mexico, and then we had 11 years 
in Paris, then went 
back to Mexico, and 
now we™ve been here since Œ it™s 14 years? 
 

Q: You were married in 1949. 

 

A: No, before that, ™47, yeah, and I got my c
itizenship without him. I had been here the 
length of time . I didn™t get it Œ it wasn™t a
ny shor ter because I had married an American 
citizen. I got it on my own. I™m very pleased with that. 
 

Q: So, when did you become
 an American citizen? 
 

A: On the nose, five years after I came here, exactly, ™46. 

 

Q: Lucie, thank you so muc h. 

 

A: Thank you very much. 

 

Q: Now, we™ll stop the tape andlook at some  of the photographs. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: Can you describe this? 

 
A: This is Zagreb, and the address is Jelaci
c Trg, which means Jelacic Square, which is the 
absolute center of town, and this original house in front, which is the oldest house on that 
square, was built somewhere in the 1840s, ma
ybe  1850, a very fa mous architect called 
Feldinger. When they started building it, Je
ws were still not allowed to have houses 
within the confines of the c
ity, and then after that, by the 
time they fi nished, it al ready 
was built and my great-grandfather lived 
there. It was built for two fa milies. 
 

Q: And this picture? 

 

A: This picture is Janusevac, which is our 
country house built some where in the 1840s, and 
so on, we were one of the last owners, I suppose, and it™s about 15 miles from Zagreb. 

We stayed there as long as there was no sc
hool. Let™s say we stayed there from April 
through October, but as there was no central 
heating, we then went to town and lived on 
Jelacic Trg. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: And this is the entrance hall of Janusevac, 
and these two bronze vases or  whatever they 
are, are actually from China. This cam
e from somebody, I don™t know, friends whose 
parents were there during 
the Boxer Re bellion, brought 
it back, and I don™t know how

they came into the family, and in the mi ddle is
 this round room which we  used to call the 
chapel, which Œ we called it the chapel because there was a Œ not organs, but a 
harmonium Œ were there, and it had a nice c
upola. As children we used to dance there 
mostly.  
 

Q: This? 

 

A: This is what we used to call the chapel, 
a round room, and I guess we used to call it the 
chapel because it was there big musical instru
me nt that™s normally in churches, and from 
that door over leads to
 a drawing room which is where the piano was, and it led to the 
balcony, the front balcony. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: This was the ma in drawing room, I guess. Th
ere was some  or iginal frescoes up there, but 
one of them was mi ssing so, 
one of them is false. There™s nothing there now. Maybe 
some  shelves. I think my father had them restored, and had one of these painted 

originally, the one on top ma ybe Œ I have no id
ea who the painter was of these paintings. 
This particular stove was from my gr a
ndmother™s house in town. I don™t know when it 
was brought to Janusevac. I don™t reme mber.  
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: This is my bedroom, and this is a portra
it of my mother at age 17, and that™s the only 
thing that exists. The portra
it disappeared and that™s all 
gone, and there™s a wooden saint 
there Œ I believe it was Sa int Christopher. As 
I said, that™s my bedroom. You can even see 
the salon, look at that. [New picture] This 
is the house. This is 
what the country house 
looked like after the war. According to one
 story Œ we know that the Germans kept 

ammunition in the ce llar, and we™re told th
at they exploded this when they were 
retreating. On the other hand, others said th
at the Ustashe did it,
 but who knows?  And, 
after the war, there were fewer and fewer, 
and fewer bricks because they insist ed on 
rebuilding it unnecessarily for my 
taste, after the war, and the 
peasants needed to get their 
houses fixed. So, they just went and got all of
 the bricks. So, finally they had to build a 
brickyard to rebuild it, which I think was ridi
culous, and now it is a
pparently an archive 
of the city of Zagreb. I don™t know what™s in
side. Dora was there. She was the last one 
there, and it™s all painted up. 
 

Q: This? 

 

A: This is a group on my seventh birthday. 
The woma n behind me , the girl behind me , was a 
year older than the rest of, is still alive. He
r son Œ her name  is Angie Zaus (ph), her son is 
a professor at Zagreb Universit
y. The girl in the sort of sa
ilor suit is Zora Kr ajce. Her 
father was a banker. She was killed in the 
most Œ no, she actually committed suicide by 
going to lie down with a bunch of people who ha
d some  infec tious disease because they 
took away her child and threw it into the 
Danube, frozen Danube. The girl on the other 

side is some body by the name  of Cerhov (ph), sh
e is alive and living 
in Israel. The other

girl, her name  is Rudfeld, and she was a Œ 
she lost her mother, and I don™t know, she was 
a classmate. The little one who is sitting on 
the chair, she was in Bergen-Belsen and she 
lost her child there. On the bottom is a cous

Florida. 
 

Q:  

 

A: This is my father, Manfred Sternberg. He™s
 wearing the uniform of the Yugoslav army of 
which he was a captain in the reserve, and the decorations are Saint Sava and got a 

Georgia Crown of I don™t which order, but this
 apparently was with my br other when he 
was killed in France. 
 

Q: And the other picture? 

 

A: The other picture is me  in this dress. That
™s an evening dress, s
itting. Behind me  is my  
mother, on the left Œ no, okay, th
is is Dragon Mauntner who wa
s killed by the Nazis very 
early on. It™s almost legendary 
what happened to him, and the 
other is Œ on his left is 
Zlata Mainic (ph), who was a good friend of
 mi ne from childhood on, he became an 
Ustashe and then fl ed to Argentina. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: This is in a place called Gl
ovidin Adolf which is on the north
ern Adriatic coast. This was 
in 1939, probably June, early June, and this 
is Joseph Heaton, who was then my fiancé, 
who was an Englishman who was killed in Burma . [New picture] This is Josip Levac, 

known as Sepa, who was our chauffer, and actually family friend. His father was Œ 

worked for my grandfather. In the back is my cousin who died. My father gave him this 

car when we left Yugoslavia, and he became 
the driver of Artukovic, the Minister of 
Interior for Croatia and he was 
forced to do that. [New pictur
e] This is my brother Mario 
Sternberg who was killed in Sainte-Mère-
Eglise in Normandy, obviously an American 
soldier. He was three years younger than I wa
s, and I think this was the one for mal 
picture we had of him in his uniform. 
 

Q: _______? 

 

A: Uh, 19, he mi ght be 20, some where there. 

 

Q: Okay.

en he was working for the United States 
governme nt abroad, they were meant to wear
 a uniform and t hey hand sewn-on ranks of

so on, and the Germans were still around. He wa
s 32 or 33 years old, and then worked for 
the Office of Wa r Information, 
and later became a j
ournalist. mostly with the Associated 
Press. 
 

Q: Was he wearing the uniform when you me t? 

 

A: I think he Œ he had the uniform. I don™t th

horrible hat, green.
