 I Œ at that

 area, until my hiding, I really don™t 
remember much. But, I have 
a picture that I carry around, that my father used to 
carry around and now I™m carrying it. It™s 
of my  mo ther, who is wearing the Jewish

walking down th e so Œ side
walk with a bouquet of fl
owers, which is what you

is the picture that I™m handing you. 
Q: Oh my, yes. 
A: And that™s Œ that™s the last picture that we have.

kind of families they came from? 

A: Sure.

Fayge
(ph) 
Buchla
(ph) 
Rappaport.
 She came from 
Warsaw, Poland
 with her family, and the family
 was settled Œ they settled in 
France, 
I believe it™s in 
Paris. 
But Œ okay, and that™s wher
e my  mo ther had her life 
and her

itizen? Did th e fam Œ when did her family

A: I don™t know the dates. And 
Œ it mu st have been in th e 20s. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I™m sure, because my
 father, he comes from
 Poland
, and his parents Œ I don™t 
know the city offhand wher
e they came from, but when
 my father was 14 Œ fa Œ 
either 14 or 16, his father told him go, ge
t out of here and make your life. He put 

him on a train and wherever you can go, go
 and try an d survive, because there™s 
nothing here. And th is is 1928. So  Œ and 
my  father was born in  1911, so he was 
about 15 - 16, somewher
e around that time. 
Q: Oh my  gosh. 
A: And Œ and th at father, his father did that
 with Œ they  had three sons, and th ey did 
it with both Œ 

Q: The three? 

A: All three. Because his father was more 
or less, very religious. And all I know is 
from the stories that all he 
did was pray all the time, a
nd I think he was one of, like 
a 
habah
(ph) type of person. His mo ther na
med Œ my  fa Œ my  grandfather, my  
father™s father was named, I think, 
Isadore
. And my  grandmother™s name was
 
Sara h. 
And she was a little more educated. So 
my father traveled wherever he 
wound up, went to 
Germany
 and all this, an d Œ

ere h e met my  mo th er. 
S o meho w my  mo th er woun d  
up with her family, live in
 Holland
 for awhile. And 
then my mother™s fa
mily went back to

mother had, was a total of five children 
from her family, and my father had three, 
there were three brothers.

A: Oh, okay. My father passed away in 1997.
 I found letters at that time that my  
father had co rresponded, or da Œ my  Œ hi
s parents have corresponded with him from
 
Poland
, trying to get to 
Holland.
 And the letters were all in Yiddish. 
Q: And what year were they written? 

A: 1933 and ™34. And I f Œ was trying to 
find an interpreter for those letters, an d I 
did, through my child 
survivors group that I had join ed in  the 90s. And I had those 
letters interpreted the best 
that that person co uld, becau
se she told me there was a 
lot of dialects of Yiddish. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And they™re writing that th
ey needed money, like five 
Œ
 whatever the currency is 
Œ 

Q: 
Zlotys
? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: 
Zlotys
. 
A: 
Slocky
(ph). Five 
slocky
(ph) to give to where they
 were renting a house. And 
th ey  n e ed ed  si Œ  th ey
 were very, very poor. And by be
ing very, very p
oor is why he 
sent his sons away. So, act
ually from 1920 on, ™28 on, my  father never saw his 
parents and the parents never saw their children.

A: Okay. So, my father, I had that pict
ure at home of him getting off the train 
station, I Œ either 
Germany
 or wherever it™s at. So he settled in 
Holland
, in
 
Eindhoven
. Somehow became eind Œ
 Eindho v en.
 And I Œ like I said, I believe that 
my mother™s parents came to
 Holland
, and that™s how my parents met each other. 
My mo ther™s father was a Œ a le Œ dealing 
in  leather goods. And th en they wound up 

back in

A: One of them Œ the younger
 one did. Ther Œ they were
 two years apart. The older 
brother,
 Ted
, he Œ I don™t know too mu ch ab out him, how he wound up in 
America
, 
but he hid on a ship  or so
mething like Œ as a cook. 
Q: A stowaw  Œ 
A: A stowaw ay, yeah . And that™s how he came to
 America
. And Œ and he™s the one 
who wound up sponsoring us. So, I have a pict
ure, and it mu st have been before he 

wound up in  
America
, when  I™m a Œ a baby, and my  parents are taking me Œ my  
father had a 
Ford
, a car, and it mu st have been  1930 
Œ probably 30 Œ late thes Œ ™37 
or ™38, and they put me in the back of
 the car, like a little ha
mmock. I mean, very 
safe. And I was Œ that™s
 how they traveled to
 Paris
. And I have a picture of my  
Uncle
 Ted
 and my  parents and me in 
Paris
. And that™s where my
 mother™s family 
was, so they traveled
 to Œ to visit them. 
Q: So, you know your grandfather™s pus
h, your grandfather™s will got realized 
pretty early on, because fo
r a young boy of 15 to 
leave a very poor place in
 Poland
 
Œ 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: Œ in the late 20s, and within  a decade 
to have a car, in those years was a huge 
thing.  

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
10
A: Yes, yes. I don™t know wh
at he was doing, I Œ that part, I have no idea. I also 
have a picture of a very  nice, low hous
e, because they™re all connected. And the 
way my  mother was dressed, overall, they 
were doing very nicely, apparently. My 
father later on, and maybe that™s what he 
did early on, was in the hosiery and socks 
and so on. 
Q: So, you don™t know your 
father™s business when he 
Œ you know, you don™t know 
how he made a living when  you were born? 
A: Before Œ no, no, I do not know. Neve r talked about it. And the problem is, I 
never asked questions. You know, children, 
we didn't ask questions. We had a nice 
Œ I was dressed very nicely, everything wa
s fine. So when I saw the pictures, and 
they were still alive, and I just looked at 
the picture, oh how ni
ce. But I never asked 
any questions. I was Œ I was a child, I just 
did what had to be 
done and I listened. 
And when the time came that 
I had to go into  hiding, I don™t know if I asked why, 
but they  always Œ I think th ey just gave 
a story, well, you™re gonna stay with Œ 
should I say the name? Yeah, not yet. 

Q: No, let™s Œ let™s Œ le Œ we™ll get to ther
e. I want to Œ what I want to ask you now 
is, what are your earliest memories? 
A: My earliest memories, actual, p hysi
cal memories are fro
m the hiding time. 
Q: So you don™t rememb er 
your life before at all? 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
11
A: No, only wh at I see on a picture, but 
nothing, noth ing. My hiding life is Œ 
Q: But how old were you when  you Œ 
A: Four and a half. 
Q: Four and a half. 
A: Yeah, cause this is the time, th at pictur
e that I showed you, ju
st a little after that 
is July 1942, we had to go into  hiding. 

Q: So, what you learn about the Œ the backgr
ound to going into 
hiding is everything 
from what is to Œ had been told to you later, okay, is that correct, yeah? 

A: Yeah, that™s correct, that™s correct. 

Q: Then, in that case, can you tell me a l
ittle bit about what yo
u had been told, and 
then we™ll get to your hiding experience. 

A: Okay . 

Q: How did your parents explain Œ was it your
 mo ther or your father who told  you, 
or both? 
A: No, well, my mother. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yes. She said that I had to go and live 
with these people and they were going to 
live with some other pe Œ they were gonna 
go away, not live, goin
g away to Œ to be

with these people, but they™ll 
come back to see me, and we
™ll all be together again. 
And that™s a time that Œ 
Q: Do you remember that 
date? I mean, di Œ not the 
date, do you rememb er being 
told this, at the time? 

A: I Œ yes, tha-that™s when they took me 
to these people that they knew prior and 
arranged, made this arrangement that I w
ould go be living with them. They had no 
children of their own, and Œ and they, like 
I said, would be coming back to take me 
home.  

Q: And you reme mb ered being brought there, and Œ 

A: Oh yes, and I remember crying after 
them leaving, and they  were crying and Œ 
and I ran after them. A nd the people that
 I stayed with, whic
h I wound up calling
 
Tante 
and
 Omaya
(p h) are holding onto me and not letting me run too far, but yes, I 
remember that like yesterday. 

Q: Yeah.  
A: Those are the memo ries I Œ 
I really have 
so strongly.  
Q: Well, that™s not surprising, in a Œ in 
a way, because for a ch
ild it™s so traumatic, 
when you already know who your 
mother and your father is Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: And then  Œ and th at Œ you™ve never known what it™s like to not have them. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
13
A: Oh, absolutely. No, we always seemed 
to have Œ I mu st ha
ve had a very good 
life because there™s nothing traumatic fo
r me to Œ to remember. And it™s like 
children Œ like my own child
ren, they don™t remember that time either.  
Q: That™s right. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s right. So, what can you tell me 
about Œ fi-first from your memo ry of the 
people that you were brought to Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ what kind of impressions 
you had. And then filling in some of the facts of what 

you learned later. 
A: Okay, okay. The people 
that I was staying with was Œ I called her was 
Tanta
 
Rowter
(ph), that was her last name, a real 
Dutch name because sh Œ actually, she 
was German, but she had lived
 there for a long time and married this Dutch man 
called 
Yap
(ph) 
Ro wter
(ph). And they were Œ had no ch ildren. 
Q: Were they older people? 
A: To Œ in my eyes, they 
were older, and they probably
 were in their maybe late 
30s, early 40s. They were old people, b
ecause my parents were so much younger. 
Cause my  father Œ my  mo ther was born in
 1912, 1912, and my  mo th er was born in 
1911. So in 1942 Œ well, maybe
 they were more or less th e same age. But Œ so  I st Œ 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
14
I Œ I lived with them, I was to
 be their niece, and I had to  live their way, their last 
name, their religion, wh ich was Œ they didn™t
 really have much of religion, but there 
was Protestant. And I was going to  be raised Catholic. 
Q: They were Protestant and youwere going to be raised Catholic? 
A: Because they had a Œ a Œ a maid, a y
oung girl, 18 or 19, sh
e came every day. 
And she™s the one wh o taught me the Catholic
-ism type of thing. And because that 
way I could go to th e church  and with Œ 
and go to  school with the nuns. So  Œ 
Q: And what wi Œ did 
you have another name? 
A: 
Rowter
(ph)
, Paula Rowter
(ph). 
Q: Pa Œ so you si Œ made Œ 

A: Just as 
Paula Œ 
Q: Œ it into 
Paula Rowter
(ph). 
A: Œ 
Ro wter
(ph), yeah. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And that was my  name, and I went
 to school for about three months. 
Q: At age four and a half you started Œ 

A: Well, now it™s five. 
Q: Age five, okay. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
15
A: Yeah, yeah. And I did the catechis Œ I 
Œ you know, I do rememb er this church 
and the nuns and the water that™s o n  the side
, and Œ and I ha Œ I was so excited, this 
maid who was there, she gave me a rosary
. Oh, and that was such a personal thing 
that was mi ne, you know. I don™t know if 
I knew that I had been , or was Jewish. I 
don™t know because I never dea lt with that until afterwards. 

Q: Well, what was the maid™s name? Wh
at was she like? You don™t remember? 
A: I don™t remember h er name. It was a 
real Dutch name. And sh e was very nice, 
she helped  me a lot and Œ and Œ a
nd when  I was livi
ng there with the 
tante
, I was 
normal. I had a normal life. I guess I forgot about my  parents, you know. 

Q: Well, I wanted to ask you that. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you have any nightma
res, did you cry for Momma
, or Œ or Œ or Father? 
A: I don™t seem to remember that. But if I re
ally think deeply and 
go back a lot, that 
I mu Œ I think I must have done that in the first few days, because my 
tante
 gave me 
a doll with a little carri
age to, you know, keep me ha
ppy and to just divert my 
attention. And I think, you kn
ow, when I really go deep 
now that I™m talking to you 
about that, about my ow
n past feelings and all that, Ican  see the carriage and I can 
see the doll. And also I can see her kitchen. 

Q: What did it look like? 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
16
A: Was a big kitchen, a real bare room 
with a big, black stove. And she would be 
cooking with the maid, who would be help
ing. I was also with the maid now, 
helping her clean rooms. See, the people, th
ey ran a boarding house
, so they Œ it was 
a big house, and they  had lots of rooms an
d the maid would work  in the rooms, or 
clean the bed and the bathroom, a
nd I would be helping her, becau Œ 
Q: That™s a na Œ I-I™m sorry to interrupt, bu
t it™s a bit unusual. I mean, the first thing 
that strikes me is, oh my  goodness, hiding 
a child in plain sight, because if you have 
a boarding house, you have a lo
t of people coming through. 
A: Yeah, but I was dur Œ her niece from Œ 
wherever that niece came from, where 
my  
tante
 was German, but I didn™t speak German, I spoke Dutch. So, the niece was 
either from the husband™s side, my 
Oma
, cause he was perfectly Du tch, he was all 
Dutch. And I don™t know whose niece I was,
 b u t she always said I™m her niece. And 
like I said, I did go to school for a little 
bit, and I had a firs
t communion, whatever 
that age was, I don™t know. 

Q: Seven Œ well, usually it™s age 
seven, but it could be earlier. 
A: It had to be earlier, cause I was not 
allowed Œ the first few months I was out, 
they had children next door, the neighbor
 had children, a little boy and a girl, and I 
would play with them. And 
they had a, like a Œ they 
built a Œ where you go hide 
when the bombs come. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
17
Q: A shelter. 
A: A shelter, a shelter. And I would play 
with these children a few times, and then 
they start to ask questions of me. I was 
not blonde and blue-e
yed, you know, I was 
dark haired. And they 
would say, are you Jewish
? And I would ask my  
tante,
 what 
does that mean, am I Jewish? She says, now
 you can never go 
outside any longer, 
because the parents of those children Œ 

Q: Were curious. 
A: Œ were Œ by talking. They  also had th
at big shelter, which they dug down  and 
that™s all sand, you kn
ow, like a Œ like a little 
[indecipherable]
 like a little 
mountain. And 
Ta nte
 had asked the parents if we c
ould go in  there if it needed, for 
the bombs, and they  said no. They sa
id no. So they were very anti. 
Q: So, did you Œ wh en 
you Œ when  you asked 
Ta nte
, what does this mean, and I 
Jewish Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and she said, you can™t go out there a
ny mo re, did she also answer that you 
were Jewish, or did she tell you anything? 
A: No, no, no, she never told
 me that I was Jewish. Sh e says, you just cannot play 
with, those are not nice children, you cannot 
play with them. Okay
, I™m a nice little 
girl and I listen. And she said, you cannot 
go outside any mo re, and I didn't ask. I

was content in the house. And between 
her, she was very sweet to me, and my 
uncle, who was very nice, he Œ they  had no
 children, they enj
oyed Œ I would Œ I was 
allowed to go in th
e garden with my
 oma
, cause he was growing vegetables. I 
remember that, and I was going with the ma
id to help clean the house, and I play ed 
with my doll. That™s what I called, yeah. 

Q: Okay , hang on a second, so
 you stayed home and yo
u™d play with your dolls? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Or go out Œ was their garden visibl
e to the other family, or was it walled? 
A: Yes, because there™s no walls. In 
Euro pe
 there™s no walls, at least in
 Holland
 at 
that time. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: No, they had a Œ a dirt area somewhere,
 I don™t know, because the back of th eir 
house had like a water, a little Œ not a ri
ver, but something that flowed, with 

beautiful Weeping Willows. 
Q: Oh, wow. 
A: I™ll never forget the Weeping Willows, it 
was just so pretty. Her front yard had 

like a little fence full of
 roses. And the house was a very nice house, I Œ I Œ when I 
went back  in 1985, I found it and I 
Œ but anyway, that™s another story. 
Q: We™ll get there. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
19
A: Yeah. 
Q: We™ll get there. And you don™t reme
mb er feeling that somebody Œ something 
was taken from you that you couldn™t play 
with the children any mo re, you just 
accepted it and Œ and went on? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Did you continue going to sc
hool, to th e Catholic school? 
A: No, at that time I co uldn™t do anything any more. 
Q: Because of this? 
A: Because of this. I Œ 

Q: So th ey kept you in the house. Howe
ver, during the few months that you had 
been there they had gotten you Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ they  had gotten you to  take first communion? That™s a huge thing. 

A: That™s a huge thing is right, but I 
could not go outside any mo re after those 
children. Maybe it was a little longer period 
than what I™m rememb ering, because I 
reme mb er going to  the nuns, and I think 
the nun knew who I was. But they  were 
very nice, very sweet, but I remember doing 
that, and then I remember I couldn™t do 
anything any mo re, I had to stay inside
. And it got heavier, I think, when  the 
Germans got more prominent there.

Q: And did they become mo re prominent there? 
A: Yes. 

Q: How did this take Œ how did this unfold? 
A: My Œ because of my  
tante
 and 
omaya
(p h)
 
having this big house Œ excuse me Œ 
the Œ they had to take in an
 SS
 officer. He had to live in because they  had the room. 
And that™s how heavy it got wh en
 he is there and I™m there. 
Q: Did you Œ were Œ do you have memo ries of him?  

A: Yes. 
Q: What did he look like?  

A: I don™t have a face. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Just a uniform. Ugly black, horrible blac
k, black uniform with big, black boots. 
Those uniform and the boots are with 
me 24/7 if I allow it to come out. 

Q: Scary. 
A: I don™t know his face. Very scary, caus
e I™m in the house there with people and 
so on, and now we have this 
guy there. I sit on his lap, he
 puts me on his lap, I talk 
to him like a soldier. 

Q: So you rememb er doing that? 
A: Oh yeah. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein

21
Q: And do you remember 
being scared while you were on the lap? 
A: On and off. I kind of go t to know him, you know, he 
was there fo Œ seemed to 
me for a long time. Til the end. He was there until the end. 
Q: And you don™t remember his face? 
A: No, I have no vision of his face. I-I eith
er didn™t Œ don™t want to remember it Œ I 
don™t know, because to me the Œ the uni
form is all I know, is the uniform. 
Q: And did you Œ did 
your Œ did he seem 
Œ why was he scary to you? I mean Œ 
A: Because I have never seen a person wi
th a uniform like that
. I mean, that™s a 
horrible thing, I Œ I am young, and I was Œ lived in a nice area at home, there w as no 

unifo rms. 
Tante 
didn™t have any unifo rms. The people that lived there were no 
unifo rms. And then  comes this guy with 
the Œ the boots, you know, and it click-
clacked the way it Œ that was Œ 

Q: And nobody told you
 that this is someone to take 
Œ this is someone to be careful 
around? 
A: No, th ey wanted me to be just casua
l, because I™m Œ you know, and I was taught, 
and being me, I was told neve
r say wh at your real last name is, and just I™m your 
tante
 and I™m your 
oma
, you™re just living here with 
Œ with me. And th at Œ that was 
it. He did have other ones, other soldiers 
came to the house. 
When that happened,

when  other 
SS 
officers came to the house, I had 
to go to the basement. I wasn™t 
allowed to be around, because Œ 
Q: It could be for many re
asons, I mean, i-if a child Œ 
A: Sure. 

Q: Œ is told that it doesn™t necessarily 
mean you™re in mortal danger, it means we 
have too many people in the house, children 
have to go upstairs. Was that kind of 
the Œ or downstairs Œ 
A: Some Œ yeah, downstairs.  
Just something, you know, 
there™s too much, and that 
they™re talking and all that, and you™ll just 
be in their way. So 
I had to go in the 
basement, and I took my  dolly and my  Œ my
 Œ my  Œ I forgot the name of it now Œ 
the rosacal Œ what do you call Œ 
Q: The rosary. 

A: Rosary, yes, that was always with me
. The rosary was my savior. I was tau ght 
that that™s my savior. When
ever there™s something bad, 
I need to pray with this 
rosary. 

Q: Did you Œ did you learn prayers? 

A: I learned pray ers, I don™t reme mb er 
them, cause right the war was over, I did 
away with all that, and I don™t remember th at. 

Q: But you learned them at the time. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
23
A: But I remember having them in my ha
nd, and knowing how to
 inter Œ interlink 
them in my fingers, and making the cross,
 and had my little dolly. And that was it. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah.  
Q: And how long did 
you live at the fa Œ with the family? 
A: Two and a half years. 

Q: Did you ever see your real
 parents during that time? 
A: No. No. 

Q: That™s amazing. 

A: That™s amazing, that Œ 
Q: That™s amazing. 
A: Œ I didn™t see them, I didn
't Œ I might have asked my  
tante
 a few times, and after 
that I became so much like 
a child, well, now you™re liv
ing with so mebody else. 
This is your life now. This is how you have
 to survive, and this
 is Œ this is it. 
Q: How would you de
scribe yourself? 
A: As very timid at that tim
e. Not today, but at that 
time. And always listening to  
what I was told. 
Q: A good girl. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
24
A: A very  good girl, yes, and I s Œ good gi
rl. Had the big bow in  my  hair, you know, 
all that.  
Q: And did photo Œ 
A: And whatever they did for me Œ told
 me to do, I would do, go with him Œ
 Ta nte,
 
go with
 Omaya
(ph)
 
now and this and that. Or go w
ith Œ now I wish  I rememb er the 
name of that cleaning lady Œ that mai-ma
id, or whatever they called her. Yeah, I 
was. I™m getting emotional. I have Œ I have
 not been emotional about this, because 
I™m emotional about something else. 
Q: What about this brings it up? 

A: I don™t know, about the way I was when 
I was a little girl, that
™s all I remember. 
And maybe cause I mi ss Œ miss the people I 
lived with. They were Œ they were nice. 

And you know, when you talk
 about every little detail, br
ings back memories, and 
my state of my Œ my being at the moment 
is very touchy because
 I lost my husband 
seven months ago, an d Œ 
Q: Oh. 
A: Œ I think that™s why I™m more
 emotional than I usually am. 
Q: Well, we™re also talking about losses.
 And so, we™re starting from the beginning 
where there are attachments, 
and then there are losses. 
A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
25
Q: You know, and th at™s the Œ when you™re
 a child Œ I rememb er growing up Œ you 
know, one of our roles is to
 talk as little as p o ssible, but you know, the Œ the Œ it 
creates a frustration. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Because when  you have somebody telli
ng you things, you want to say oh yes, 

and this reminds me of this. Well, let me 
share with you what th
is reminds me of. I 
reme mb er growing up and hearing how mu ch
 parents love children, you know. I 
grew up in Œ in a family where I was love
d, and hearing about parents love children. 
And wh en I had my  own child, this revelati
on happened , that when  I would walk in 
the room, her face lit up. When I™d come  home from w o rk, she would jump  up and 
down in her crib. And I rea
lized, it™s a two way street. 
A: Yes. 

Q: That ch Œ that love that that child 
is giving me is real, and I feel it and it 
energizes me, and it is amazing and it is pur
e. And there™s no farce to it whatsoever, 
it is genuine. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And so when  I hear yo
u speak about the people that
 you were living with, I 
imagine a little girl who™s a good child, who does as she™s told, who has this 

inherent trust that she is 
being protected by good fo rces. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
26
A: Exactly. And now, that™s exactly the fee
ling that it is and th at™s bringing tears to 
my eyes because I can™t im
agine that Œ that all that
 happened. But you know, I 
reme mb er s o  mu ch  o f  th at p e
riod, and so much of afterwards, too. But I think it™s a 
little bit because of my Œ 
Q: Also you™re going through another loss. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Huge loss.  
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. My sy
mp athy to  you. 
A: Oh, thank you. 
Q: Yeah. Are there any other memories th
at you can come to mi Œ that come to 
mind whe Œ through that time that
 you were with this Œ with
 Ta nte Ro wter
(ph), 
and 
Oma
 
Riap
(ph)? Any other people in the board
ing house besides the Œ the black 
suited 
SS 
man ?  
A: Yeah, there was a Œ there was a man th ere and there was a woman there. I don™t 
know their names, but I remember, vaguel
y, their faces. See, I remember their 
faces, I remember this girl, th
e maid, her face, but not this
 SS 
officer™s face. So Œ 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
27
Q: That™s really uncanny, yeah. 
A: So maybe inside of me I knew it was danger, because this man with boots and a 

unifo rm, that would represent to any ch ild Œ 
Q: Scary. 
A: Scary, yes. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: Exactly. 
Q: But Œ and for you in particular, really scary. 
A: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don™t know if 
we™re ready for the end of it, because of 
something th at Œ that he did at the end, how Œ 
Q: Well, tell u Œ tell us.  
A: Œ wh en th e war ended. Well, during the war, I Œ I Œ with the bomb ing, two doors 

down , there was another shelter there, and 
those people let us in because we did 
have the bomb ing scares, and we were in 
the shelter, and all of us, the people th Œ 
Q: Were these allied bombers? 
A: No Œ ye Œ yes. Well no, I don™t know
. No, I think there™s Œ German? I don™t 
know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: That part I don™t know, I Œ all I know is bombs. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
28
Q: Yeah. 
A: And we all went in there and I remember
 in that shelter, I prayed like anything, 
because the girl was with me and I went 
Œ boy, I went to town and prayed and 
prayed  and prayed  that we wouldn't get hurt. 

Q: With the prayer
s from the rosary? 
A: Yeah, with the rosary an
d the whole thing. Yes, I re
member th at. I remember the 
shelter cause they had like shelves of beds
, you know, in there in case we had to 
stay. 

Q: A big shelter, yeah. 

A: Yes, a big shelter. And wh en it was ove
r, the raid was over, the house next door 
to 
Tante
, that got bomb ed, but we did not, our
 house was saved. So, I Œ all that 
praying I did helped  our house. 

Q: I™m sure of it. 

A: Yeah. So, when they ende
d th e war, the two and a half
 years have gone Œ well, 
no Œ yeah , it mu st have been at that time, he
 Œ he had to  leave, of course. And when  

he left, we stood at the front door, and th
at™s another vision I have, just right now. 
My 
tante
 is here, I™m o v er here, he is outside
 facing me, and he™s looking right at 
me. And his finger comes up, and he says, 
Paula,
 now you can go 
free. Now, he™s 
speaking German, and my 
tante
 knows German. And I™m standing there and he

says, you can go free. After he leaves, 
tante
 looks at me, because now I™m Œ I™m 
seven, and she says, he knew. He knew. 
Now I know that I™m Jew ish because I™m 
seve Œ I™m older, maybe they to ld me, or 
Œ and th en she says, he knew that you 
were here hiding, or something, another word
 that she sai d . And th
at™s what he said, 
so Œ 
Q: And you reme mb er him saying this? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, 
I reme mb er him standing there, I don™t see a face, I see 
that unifo rm and that finger coming right at me, pointing. He says, 
Paula
, you can 
go free. So this guy either had a heart, ei
ther he has his own ch ild, cause I did sit on 
his lap, and he didn't turn me or them
 or anybody in th is whole household in. 
Q: Who knows, maybe he wa
s the protector of them. 
A: And then  I thought maybe all my  praying work ed. 

Q: There would be people who will say, absolutely. 

A: Yeah. I 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Because such things are mi
r Œ such things are miracles. 
A: Right, right. 

Q: You know. And when y
ou Œ wh en y Œ when you h
eard that, did you have a 
certain feeling? Did you freeze, did you 
kind of go numb? Do you rememb er, like, 
what feeling unmasks Œ 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
30
A: Well, I rememb er I couldn™t understand, 
I didn™t quite comprehend what all that 
meant. So, I™m su
re I talked to 
Tante
 about that and I think what she said is now, 
pretty soon, Mommy  and Daddy are gonna come Œ 
Q: To get you. 
A: Œ to get you, yeah . 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So, she must have know
n they™re still aliv e.  
A: She mu st have, because she knew that 
they were coming at a certain day. So, 
either they were able to, through their hi
ding place Œ places, they
 had several hiding 
places Œ my father had a fight with a 
German soldier on top Œ on the roof. 
Q: Oh my. We can get to that story. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 yeah, okay. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But they mu st have known how to get in
 touch with each other, one way or the 
other, to say this and th is date, you kno
w, they ™re gonna come and get you. But I 
remember in the house, when
 it became close to the liber
ation time, we went Œ it 
was e Œ nighttime I™m not Œ evening time, it 
was very dark out, and we went up on 
the Œ they had little windows 
up in the attic, and I guess 
they heard on the news or 
something that the liberators were co
ming. And they were going to  come by 
parachute out of the plane in 
Sun, s-u-n, 
that™s a name o f a little town near

Eindhoven.
 So we all went up there, I reme
mber that, looking out the window and 
there™s all these white parachutes, one afte
r another, after another, after another, and 
we were so happy to see that, cause they we
re going to liberate 
us, and Œ and if you 
watch the movie, the Œ ﬁ
The Longest Day
ﬂ Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ with the Battle of the Bulge 
and all that, and they talk about 
Eindhoven
 and 
they talk about the parachutes coming do
wn . So when  I see that movie and Œ and 
wait for that particular scene, it just all 
come s right back  and th ere™s just such a 
great feeling. 

Q: Amazing. 
A: 
America
, 
och, America
,
 
then the soldiers walkin
g down th e street and the 
English ones, the Americans and they gi
ve you th e chocolate and Œ and they ™re 
wearing nice uniforms, not this ugly, te
rrible black uniform and oh Œ that Œ 
when ever I would see soldiers, you know, walk
ing around and all that, I just felt oh, 
they™re Œ they™re my savio
r. They™re Œ they™re Œ they
™re wonderful, wonderful 

people, you know, you can trust them
. You couldn™t trust the ugly ones. 
Q: No. 
A: No. So Œ 
Q: So when did your parents come? 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
32
A: Well, they came, it was 1945. 
Q: Do you remember the Œ 

A: They did not come when
 Holland
 was liberated in ™44. We weren™t always Œ I 
think, not sure that we were free s Œ 
until the war actually was over. And when
 
Tante
 says, now we™re gonna go outside a
nd wait for them on the street. And the 
time came, there they were. A lot of pe
ople walking around now and all that, and 
they came down the street, and I ran to th
em, I knew th em. And they  ran to me and 
that was Œ 
Q: Oh God. 

A: Œ just a Œ yeah , they  made it and I made it and that was a great feeling, very 
healthy. 
Q: Did you feel Œ when  you saw them again, yes, I know you? 

A: Mm-hm, oh yeah, absolute
ly. And they had said they
 will come back, and they 
did. And that was Œ I mu st say, they stayed  a few days at 
Tante™s 
house until they 
could find a place for us to m
ove into. But that was the la
st time that I was their 
little girl. T h e feeling of parents and children. Because either what they went 
through Œ never talked about 
wh at they went through, except that only Œ later on 
they talked about 
it in Œ in Œ when we were here in
 America
, my  father would say a 
few things, and told  me what happened to 
him. But at that time 
they had to find the 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
33
place, they had to go back and make a 
living, and there was no closeness. The 
closeness was gone. I hav Œ was so close with
 Ta nta
 and 
Omaya
(ph), I didn™t have 
that closeness with them, eith
er b ecause the two and a half years of separation, and I 
am now a little more grown and loved the 
way I ha Œ was being treated for those 
two and a half years. N o w I™m with my pa
rents, who have nothing, and th ey can™t 
give all that feeling any more. And from 
then on in , life got hard, life was tough, 
versus the two and a half years that I had 
to endure the basement an d all that. But Œ 
Q: In what ways was it tough? How was it tough? 
A: It was tough because they
 were so much in their ow
n, with their own problems 
that they had, and not knowin
g how to really deal with me
, to Œ in other words, to 
pick up from the day that th
ey, you know, left me, until the day I Œ I Œ we Œ we were 
together. The Œ the feelings just was okay, we
 have to eat now, we have to do this 
now and you have to go to school now 
and Œ but nothing Œ I do
n ™ t rememb er an y ,  
you know Œ 
Q: Warmth. 
A: Œ all of that. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes. And then my mo
ther got pregnant, so no
w I have a little b rother. 
Q: Before we do that Œ 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
34
A: Yeah? 
Q: When  you moved away from ta Œ did y
ou Œ did you move Œ then  they stayed 
with 
Ta nte
 and 
Oma y a
(ph) for a few days, and th en you moved away with them. 
Did you go Œ did 
you move far? 
A: It wasn™t a Œ yes, from Œ well, in
 Eindho ven
, you know, nothing is far like it is 
here, but still, yeah it was a different area,
 trying to find where they could somehow 
Œ home Œ they had homes with upstairs and 
down stairs and Œ or even three times up. 
This family was willing to ta Œ give us pa
rt of a Œ a floor, and I™m sure my father 
had to pay. And how all that worked I ha
ve no idea, it never was discussed about 
money and nothing Œ and I feel bad that I di
dn™t ask later on, yo
u know, these things 
and what can I say? 

Q: But that means like, wh
en  you were Œ I Œ I guess wh
at I™m asking an-and I™m 
wondering, is that when you
™d have, let™s say, a lone
ly mo ment and you™re with 
your parents, did you 
have the ability and possi
bility to go back to
 Ta nte
 and spend 
the afternoon? 

A: I could have, but it was a long walk. I didn
™t have a bike yet, so that was a long 
walk. That™s another thing. Yeah , then
 we moved somewh ere else, I™ll tell you. 
Q: Okay . 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
35
A: No, at this Œ this place is just Œ this was called
 Willem de Zw ijgerstraat
. My 
husband 
Bernie
 and I went there, I know ex actly
 the window and everything. No, it 
was like a bad area of town.  
Q: Okay . 
A: But, it was not far from the street 
that we had lived in
 prior to the war, 
Nassaustraat. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And this is 
Willem de Zw ijgerstraat
, you can see from 
Nassaustraat
 the place 
that we wound up living after the war. So 
that, from there wasn™t Œ you know, that 
was in the same area. So I think maybe th
at™s why my  parents wound up in that 
area, cause they kn
ew  Œ and wh ere my  
tante
 lived, there was a litt
le nicer area. It 
was separate houses. This was like all 
low houses and it was a different area. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And Œ but did you see them then, 
afterwards? Did you go visit them? 
A: I saw them. We did not stay long in  this
 particular place, cause it was a bad Œ 
neighbors and a Œ we didn™t. So  my  fa
ther found th is other house called 
binnin 
Œ in 
the 
Binnaeusstraat
, wh ich was close to 
Ta nte™s 
house. 
Q: And one of the Œ

36
A: And then  Œ 
Q: Mm-hm? 

A: Œ I could go, and I walked very  often to  
Tante™s
 house. 
Q: So you Œ you didn't have a total cutoff? 

A: No, my  parents play ed bridge with th
em. So, I don™t know if they knew them 
before the war, or if they became friends 
after the war. That I don™t know, but they 
spend New Year™s together, they played
 brid ge at their house or our house. 
Q: So, there was Œ and th
ey got along well, then? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: See, some other people have said 
that sometimes th ere was some tension 
between the people wh -who saved or hid th
e children, and th e parents who returned . 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Either because one was Œ the parents were unsure Œ 

A: Unsu re. 
Q: Œ and the Œ or the people didn™t want to
 let go, or Œ or whatever. And you didn™t 
have that. 
A: Yeah, I can understand that, not Œ not 
Œ not that I know of, because they knew 
each other and they Œ like I 
said, they got together, pl
ayed bridge, I remember. 
That™s when we lived Œ yeah, in 
Binnaeusstraat
, I™m pretty sure. Or was it Œ I

don™t know which house it was in. No, I was older, it had to be

They would pull up the r
ug. My uncle was there, 
Omaya
(ph), 
Ta nte
 and my  
parents, listening to the radio, 
putting up mu sic, and they  danced . 
Q: How nice. 
A: And that™s how I learned Œ my
 Omaya
(p h) taught me how to dance, me  standing 
on his feet, and I learned how to  dance the foxtrot, and the English waltz. And I™m 

now Œ oh, I™m eight or nine or 
10 or something like th at, yeah. 
Q: After the war. 
A: After the war. That was nice, but then it also Œ that was a nice day or something, 

but the regular days, going to school was 
not nice, because I was the only Jewish 
girl, and everybody made
 fun of me, you know. 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah. So the y
ears after were not Œ 
Q: So why did they  Œ I mean, da Œ 
Holland
 has such a reputation Œ 
A: Yes.

A: There™s a lot of them that
 weren™t. There were a lot of
 people who got turned in 
by Œ we were very, very  fortunate. And Œ and 
Tante
 dealt with it very good. 
Q: What was it like in school, what were 
the kids saying? Do you have memo ries of 
that? 
A: Well, they wouldn™t talk to me becaus
e I looked different for some reason, I 
don™t know. And they weren™t Œ especially th
e boys, they were nasty, yeah. Some of 
the girls were okay. I have a book, they call it a 
poetsy
(ph), it™s Œ you ges Œ it™s like 
a poem book that all Œ everybody in school
 would get that, with little paste things, 

stick-ums that you put in there and then y
ou write a little poem of the person that Œ 
you know, like you do at
 high school here Œ 
Q: Sure. 

A: Œ they Œ they write Œ

A: Œ something like that. And I do have that
 book with Œ there

name Œ one was 
Anika
(ph), and there was a little redhead, ri-wi Œ 
Rita
, I think her 
name was, something like that. And they 
wrote in my  book. But I would never want

A: Yeah. Oh, I was very mu
ch by myself, very much. An
d then wh en my  brother 
and sister came along, I had to take care of them. Now, we™re
 nine and 11 years 
difference. And if I wanted 
to go outside and did play  w
ith the marbles, you know, 
the little ch ildren™s play, I had to take my
 brother with me. I was always like a 
caretaker of them, and I had to help. I 
never had a time, you 
know, by ourselves. 
Later on, we got a little older, the Jewish 
area built up a little bit, an d there was a 
youth group area, and that™s 
where I met this girl named
 Frieda
. And a lot of the 
Dutch people know her too, 
and she knows a lot of people. And we™ve been in  
touch ever since, together. But the only ni
ce time I had with a girlfriend, and that 
was her, because she was Jewish, and she 
lived quite far away, but I had a bike 
then, and we™d bike to her. And she had 
little cookingutensils
 and we would cook 
applesauce from scratch. That was a big thing. 
Q: Sounds like fun. 

A: Yeah, it was fun, but then, that was a day 
of having a nice day, but the rest of the 
time, this Œ in 
Willem de Zw ijgerstraat
, the house that we were in was right on the 
corner and there was train tr
acks right next to it. And 
several times the train would 
stop, and it was loaded with coal. So
 I had to go and get a Œ a pail and 
[indecipherable]
 and climb up in the train Œ and ev erybody else did that, mo stly 
guys Œ and I had to climb up th ere and steal 
the coal, so we would have coal in  the

house. Now, the train mu st have stoppe
d there maybe for a purpose, I don™t know, 
but Œ 
Q: No, not fun. No t fun. 
A: Œ I was 
[indeciphera ble]
. No t fun. I didn™t have a teenage years. There was 
nothing about me, you 
know. Very, very little. 
Q: Were y Œ did you get on with your pa
rents in a different way, or was there 
distance, they were too busy, or Œ tell us 
Œ tell me a little bit 
about how Œ how that 
went, how th at evolved.  

A: You know something, I don™t know an
y details, but I rememb er my  two and a 
half years with 
Ta nte.
 My Œ the rest of my years befo
re I came here is mostly what 
I reme mb er ome Œ you know, ask my  mo the
r, I want to go after school, go and play 

with them. No, you have to do this, and y
ou have to take care of your brother and 
you have to take care of your 
sister. Or you have to help 
me, and you have to do this 
and you have to do that
. That™s all I remember. 
Q: No fun. 

A: I don™t remember n o  closeness, where 
my  mo ther say, oh let™s go shopping, just 
you and I, let™s go, you know. 
No, because my father was 
gone basically seven days 
a week, earning a living, tryi
ng to earn a living by sellin
g his socks and so  on, on

the mart, different cities. On the weekend, 
on Saturdays, I woul
d have to go with 
him, because you have to unpack  the pack. 
Q: So you weren't religi
ous? It wasn™t if Œ 
A: No, no, there was no religion. She ne
ver benched th-the light, the candles Œ 
Q: What does that mean
? Ah-hah, she didn™t Œ 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 no. I™ve never done it either. I 
do remember g o ing to a temple, 
I do. Another thing is I reme mb er I was 
being taught by a rabbi to read Hebrew . 
And that™s when  we moved to 
Binnaeusstraat. 
I was a little older, and I remember 
going to  the temp le once. But no, nothing fo
r holid ays, except Friday  night we had 
chicken soup, you know, and 
Paula
 gets the Œ the Œ I got a Œ a polka Œ a leg and a 
neck, that™s what I got. But se
e, my wardrobe consists of two of th is and two of that, 
and that was it. Little skirt and a little top,
 I don™t remember my mother taking me 
shopping or anyth Œ I don™t rememb er any of that. 

Q: How sad. 
A: Because the other part overtook that, alwa
ys having to take care of them, that I 
just was Œ 
Q: You were gone. You weren™t th ere. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein  
November 10, 2008 

 

 
 
42
A: I wasn™t Œ I was just there to be Œ for 
that purpose. I didn™t have that closeness 
being the daughter, the first daughter, you 
know. And that™s Œ could very well be 
because of what my parents went 
through, and I™m sure that™s it. 
Q: Did th ey Œ wh en di Œ did they 
ever talk to you about any of it? 
A: No. No. Oh, you don™t 
know, and you don™t need 
to know, or you don™t 
reme mb er anything, you were too young, 
and Œ nothing. So either they were 
protecting me, I don™t know why, you 
know, that™s Œ I don™t think so .  
Q: A lot of people thi Œ a lot of people Œ I 
Œ I think that this is something that comes 
up a lot in Œ in future rela
tions after some traumatic ev
ent. A-And it™s more th an 
trauma. I mean, it is Œ it is when people 
have been subjected 
to humiliations. When 
people have been stretched to their limit, 
they think that Œ that if they don™t say 
something, they can ke
ep that kind of vulner
ability from the children Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ and maybe their children will be pr
otected from it. But then another hole 
develops, you know? 

A: Of course. 

Q: In that child, or in the relations
hip, that there™s a silence there. 
A: Right. 

 
Interview with Paula Bronstein

Q: And Œ and it™s hard. It™s ha
rd, I think, to know when 
is the rent Œ when is the 
right time? Am I damaging my child if I sa
y something? Am I going to lose it if I 
say something? 
A: Right, right. So, I know that all the time I lived in 
Holland
, I would never say 
that I was Jewish, I would never talk to any
body about it. I tried to assimilate or be 
like everybody else, but yet, I knew I was 
different, because there the fi Œ the girls 
at school, their Œ their way of doing th ings
, the way th e ate, the way they Œ their 
behavior was so different than mine. I had un
s Œ not really n Œ realizing it, I had this 
stuff on my shoulder of what
 happened to me, and I coul
d not talk about that. So, I 
always was different, and th at took me a 
long, long, lo ng time to get out of it. The 
only time I could Œ finally got out of it is
 when I joined the 
survivor, the child 
survivors™ group. 

Q: That™s a long time. 

A: Before that Œ a very long  time. Not until the early 90s.  
Q: That™s amazing. 
A: Yes. I would not talk, I worked and I 
Œ an d Œ and people find out, oh, you™re Œ 
you™re from 
Holland
. Yes. Were you there during the war? Yes. Well, what 
happened ? Noth ing. You know. Ho w I™d neve
r wear a Jewish star, I Œ I have o Œ I 
have them, but I wouldn't wear them. I™d 
Œ never the identification that I™m Jewish.

And that only Œ even  in
 America
, you know, at the beginnin
g, I wouldn™t say that I 
was Œ not Jewish, but in hiding.  
Q: Take me up to th e point wh ere you™re al ready an  adult Œ I mean
, if there is more 
t-to add to, teenage years or other events 
that you want to reme mb er, or something 
significant about your parents and Œ and Œ an
d wh at happened  during th e war years, 
fine Œ 
A: No, I just Œ I think I Œ I kind of talk
ed about that, because they wo und up being 
friends and they s Œ you know,
 play ed cards togeth er and Œ and Œ well, we just had a 
very simple life, nothing excitin
g, it was just surviving life. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And that was it. 
Q: And you came to the 
United States 
in 19 seven Œ 
A: ™50 Œ ™53. 

Q: Oh, in  1953? 
A: ™53, with my parents. 
Q: Oh, I see, I see. 

A: Yes.

 Holland
 fairly early on?

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ from 
New York,
 he wound up in  
California
, and he sponsored my father, for 
us to come. And so we came in ™53. We to
ok the Œ the Œ my  father came in 1952, he 
Œ  
Q: To set the Œ s-see Œ yeah. 
A: To see 
[indeciphera ble] 
yeah , to see how it™s gonna work . 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And then my parents, my mother had to  sell the furniture they
 had. I don™t know 
how they  got all this furnitu
re back after the war, or 
I don™t know anything about 
that. So we came on the Œ we first went to 
Paris,
 her family lived in
 Paris, 
so, to 
say goodbye. And Œ oh, during the Œ before
 that, when I was 
younger, my mot h er 
sent me to 
Paris
 to live Œ to visit my  grandpar
ents. Now, my  grandparents spoke 
French and Yiddish, I spoke Du tch. I unders
tand Yiddish, but I can™t speak Yiddish. 
Q: When  you were a baby, was it Œ did they 
sp eak to you in Dutch, your parents, or 
in Yiddish. Before

Q: You just know th at you spoke Dutch. 

A: Oh, yes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I know I spoke Dutch and I could 
understand Yiddish, from hearing it from 
them, I suppose. So  I Œ I did spend a week in 
Paris
 with my  gram Œ grandparents, 
and we couldn™t really communicate. So we
 went Œ before we left to come to
 
America
, we went to 
Paris
 and Œ to say goodbye, and board the 
Île de France
 ship. 
And we took the ship acro
ss; took about seven days I 
believe. And me with motion 
sickness, that didn't work too well, but Œ so  we got to
 New York.
 My mother™s 
girlfriend from
 Europe,
 who lived now in 
New York
, picked us up and we stayed 
for one day and then  we caught the train to go to 
California. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: And we were on a train and with my little
 brother and my little 
sister and me, so 
I had to deal with that
. And then we come to
 Los Angeles
, and my  uncle and my  
father pick us up, and th ey 
drive us to this Œ the mounta
ins, which is unbelievable to 
see, huge. It was very scary, because
 Holland
, you know, is flat. S o  the drive Œ we 
come to this area where my uncle had a quo
te, a ranch, he ca Œ which he called the 
Bar Mitzvah ranch. He had a cow, skinny 
than  anything, and several animals, and

gotta get a haircut, you gotta take off th
ese little gold earrings, they™re childish and 
you gotta grow up now. Okay . 
So , ti Œ they sent us to school, I went into th e eighth 
grade just for a few months, cause we came
 in March of ™53. And I went to this 
eighth grades class, w h ere th
ey assigned one of the pupils that sit next to me, to 
kind of teach me what™s going on. Now,
 I had some English, a little knowledge, 
cause at school in 
Ho lla n d
, th e Œ the high school there, you learn all these 
languages. I learned Du tch Œ 
of course, Du tch; English;
 French and German. Which 
I hated. So Œ so, come September, we

school, seven days a week , I had to  help 
feed the chickens. 
Q: I would have thought, I can™t wait to get away from here. 

A: And it was all manual. Eventually he
 wound up getting auto matic feeders and 
automatic water, but not while I was there.

A: I didn't fight, because it didn™t lead to a
nything, I still have to do what I Œ what I 
had to do. I told them I di
dn™t like it, but I had to he
lp support, you know, the 
livelihood. I also, across the 
street, there was a 
family there that had no children, 
and she needed somebo
dy to clean the house. So, besi
des doing the chickens and all 
that, I went there, but I loved it, because 
it was an American house. She had a piano, 
and I was able to do a little piano. And I, for lunch she would 
make me a sandwich 
on th is nice bread, and I got to drink a Co

A: In
 Lancaster

little bit. I started to ask some questions 
of them. My mother woul
d never talk about it. 
Q: Were they together in hiding? 

A: Yes, they were together, so I think she 
let him, if he did talk, you know. And he

that soldier. But otherwise, I Œ I don™t 
know anything else. And th at™s all he talked
 about, you know, that
 particular scene, 
over and over and over.

that she would faint. So, she™s the baby Œ 
Q: She figured it out. 

A: She figured out, and she didn™t work  in 
the chicken house. So  that only left my  
brother, after I left. And we would 
ask, well nor Œ my  brother™s name d 
No rma n

stays here with the chickens and those five

A: When  I came to this country , we kept 
writing letters. Cause be
fore we left, you 
know, I did say goodbye, and I think we cr
ied. She Œ she re Œ she really cared for 

me. And so then we were in touch with le
tters. I could never afford to go back to
 
Holland
 until Œ not until 1985. She passed aw
ay. I would get the letter with the 
black border. First
 Omaya
(ph) passed away, in the early 60s. And th en 
Tante
 
passed away July 31, 1975

A: No, they didn™t have children. 
Q: Œ but did they have family? Wh
at happened with their house? 
A: I don™t know, cause I never knew the family. 
Q: Oh. 

A: I never found out anything. If my 
tante
 wrote something in the letter, I don™t 
know where they™re at, or where it was. And 
in 1985, when we we
re able to come Œ 
go back, 
Bernie
 and I went Œ wanted to go to 
Holland,
 we stayed Œ we stayed in a Œ 
in a hotel in 
Heeze
, which is outside of
 Eindhov en,

Bernie
, I n Œ I 
know exactly where to go to
 the house. My girlfriend
 Trix
(ph) from school, I™ve 
always been  in touch with her, she™s not 
Jewish Œ and we always corresponded. So 
they came to the hotel, and I told
 him how to go to  the house in 
Huidenstraa t
 also, 
but then
 Trix
(ph), I think, knew where that was. But 
Bernie
 and I had done th at 
first. And I could tell him, you take this 
street and that street, I don™t know how I 
did that, but anyway, we got to the h
ouse in 85, and my Œ my  friend says, 
Trix
(ph) 
says, oh, why don™t you get out and ring th
e bell? Well, I was frozen in my seat, I 
could not get out of my  Œ the car. I started to
 cry and I said, but if I ring the bell, it™s 
Œ 
Ta nte
 isn™t there. There™s other people livi
ng th ere. I don™t want to see the way

the house is for them. I want to rememb
er the hou Œ how the 
hou Œ how the house 
was for me, with
 Ta nte.
 So I never did go in th ere. 
Q: You didn™t 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No. But, there were the roses outside 
in the front, and then we drove, cause it™s 
next to a Œ a plane, we drove around there an
d got to the back of the house with that 
water and the Weeping Willows and all th
at, and it just phew,
 floods, you know, 
comes back of memo ries. And that Œ that Œ th
at was good, that Œ I needed to do that. 

But there was nobody else 
there that I knew, yeah. 
Q: And in 1991 you say, the first time you 
felt like you could have that burden lifted 
from you, is when Œ or put wo rd s to 
things, was when yo
u joined the child 
survivors. 
A: Yeah, I joined it early 90s, I don™t exactly Œ was it ™92, I Œ I don™t quite 

remember the year, but I know 
it was in the very early 90s. 
Q: What happened 
when you joined? 
A: When I joined that gr
oup, and they had group wo rk
shops or whatever you call 
them, and I got there and I see all these peop
le who have gone thro ugh s Œ th is type 
of, you know, either in camp s or hiding, 
I was just overwhelmed, I was just shocked 
that there™s so many people. I didn™t know.

A: Yeah. And th en I Œ it Œ the pe
rson who held that wo rkshop was 
Daisy Miller
. I 
don™t know if you™re familiar, but she™s Œ sh
e did the whole Œ the conference here, 
part of it. But she was so good and sh e™s Œ people are sitting there and they™re 
talking ab out wh at happened . An d I don™t know
 if I spoke the first time that I w ent 
or not, because I was just overw helmed. I know 
Bernie
 stayed outside, he said he 
didn™t want to go in , so he stayed outsi
de. And Œ and maybe I did say, you know, 
I™m Œ I was Œ they must have asked where I™m from, an d I said from
 Holland. 
But 
most people were from
 Amsterdam
, not
 Eindhov en
, no, I haven™t found anybody, 
except my friend
 Frieda .
 It was just unbelievable, a
nd people were talking and all 
that. And it just Œ I thought, 
wow. So I went often, when
ever they had the meetings, 
and I started to talk. And it felt so good. Itfelt so good to do that, that I was getting 
a little courage. And I started to f Œ 

Q: Did your children Œ 

A: Œ I started to find out a little
 bit about me, you know. Yeah. 
Q: Did your sons ask you, 
as they were growing up? 
A: No. I really Œ I Œ I didn™t talk about it. 

Q: Do th ey ask you now? 
A: No. I have talked and to ld them, my
 grandkids and everyb
ody, they know. But 
they never come to me  and say, you want 
to talk, or ask questio
ns. They don™t. They

all feel Œ when you go to th
ese groups, sometimes the subject is, are your children, 
or do your children feel that they are hi
ndered or something, because of the mo  Œ 
par Œ the mo ther™s background, you know Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ going through the Holo caust? And 
I thought to mysel
f, no. They™ve never 
talked about it, never said, oh, because yo
u did this, that™s w
hy you™re the way you 
are, and something. So when I came home 
I asked them. I called them and I asked 
them that particular question. And their 
response was, what are you talking ab out, 
Mom? What? There™s nothing there because of
 you. No, you were always okay, that 
Œ but I don™t know. I™m very confused. 
Q: It doesn™t sound that way. It doesn™t 
sound that way. But 
you never know what 
kind of effect Œ when  you™re living, you don
™t know what kind of effect the things 
that you have experienced could have on a person who wasn™t there. 
A: Right. 
Q: You don™t know those things. 
A: No, no. But Œ 

Q: And you asked the question.

A: I asked, because I also heard so many 
people tell me that their children, even 
grown up now, have a real, severe problem,
 so many of them have to have therapy. 
Q: Well, it could have been that for you 
in your life, it soun
ds like your parents 
were stripped bare of, you kn
ow, of wh atever giving they  might have been ab le to 
give. And so it sounds like there was a real 
ef Œ cause effect of what the war did, 
and their Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ and their hiding. But that doesn™t n
ecessarily mean  that it goes on to another 
generation. 

A: Right. 
Q: It possibly, but not necessarily. 
A: Not necessarily. W ell, the one thing 
that I know when 
I got married with 
Bernie
, 
when  I was 18, he comes Œ well, he is
, and I guess he comes from v ery strong 
parents who came from
 Russia
. And growing up in
 New York
, you have a different 
way of growing up than  I did,
 of course, but he always to
ld me that I should become 
mo re independent and be strong. And he Œ he
 really had influenced me for that, and 
it helped. He never said, oh, you don™t need
 to go to these meetings, that doesn™t 
gonna help you, you know, and he was alwa
ys there, and wanted me to do what I 
needed  to do. And he 
was my support, so Œ

ry much. He was a wonderful guy. He was a 
good father, very good husband. He was Œ I 
have a picture here of him and me for 
our 50
th
 anniversary. And he really made my
 life full and Œ and comp lete and Œ and 
with no hang-ups. And I Œ I 
Œ I™m very, very blessed for 
that, because he Œ he made 
me stronger, and he made me appreciate

just Œ he was the 
right guy for me. I didn't have mu t Œ mu ch
 Œ much experience of
 dating other guys 
in Œ in 
Lancaster
, but the ones that I dated were all flakes. And then here comes 
this strong guy, and he ha
d a nice brother, and very  Œ 
that was a very, very good 
life, yes. So I miss him.

it™s mostly now because of 
Bernie
 not being with me 
any mo re, I have to be my self and Œ and 
find out who I am on my  own, and I have 
the support of my  sons, and of dear frie

acquired through the groups, and we™re cl
