Questi on:  ... get you t o st ate your na me
 and wher e you wer e
 born __________. 
An s wer: Ok ay, M e l L on don , I was b orn i n Ne w Yo rk , 
I was bor n in the Bronx, a s
 we used to
 say, in 
Charlotte Street, which is 
the famous area t hat Ro
nald Reagan stood i n a n
d sai d he was going to 
bring bac k a nd ne ver di d.  I was bor n in 1923.  
At thi s poi nt  in 1996, I 'll  be 73 in August.  M y 
fat her , excuse me, my father a
nd mo ther were both i m mi gra nts, 
my father was born in Russia, 
actuall y i n Lithua nia  and ca me  over
 to the United States 
whe n  he  was  11 years old.  He  supporte d 
the family, they lived on 
Ri vingt on( ph) Street i n the l o wer  ea
st si de , he s upporte d t he  fa mil y by 
being a professional  boxer, some thi n g I  ne ver  kne w
 about  unti l I wa s olde r and boxe d at  coll ege  a nd 
my father ta ught me everythi ng 
I kne w and he  neve r bot hered t o tell me t hat he had bee n a  
professional boxer until I read about 
it in a column  one time and fou
nd out that he was pretty good, 
whi c h is wh y he al way s wa s better th an I wh en h e  
taught me to box.  He t h
en went into the dress 
business and for the rest of his life
, until he was 83 and then retired 
and had to, becaus
e of health, h e  
wa s in the dress busi ness.  My mo
ther wa s born in Engla nd a nd ca me
 over as an infant.  So they 
really came fr om a, an immigran
t, both came fr om immi
grant fa milies.  My 
father's background  
tho ug h, wa s so met hin g t hat we we re
 never able to really trace ba
ck, we don't know why we have 
the na me  London, whic h of
 cours e wa s a t ake n na me , i n t h at
 comi ng fr om Lithuani a ther e was 
anot her na me, but his mother, bein
g far ahead of her ti me, ran away
 from her hus ba nd a nd ra n away  
wit h a love r.   No w, fo r this ha
ppeni n g at the be gi nni ng of t he  centur y, you realize i s quite a rar e  
occ urrence a nd so t he na me was pi
cked up s o me where and nobody e ver
 knew where.  I was brought 
up in the Br onx, I we nt to school in
 the Bronx, I went to cit y college
 a nd wa s interr upte d by a war.  I

enlisted in the army in 
Septe mber of 1942 and wa s disc har ged in t he s u mmer, I thi nk it was in  
August of 1946.  So I  s pe n
t four years in the army. 
Q: If you can, talk a little bit about
 before the war actually interrupt
ed your studies, what were you 
heari ng about what  was going on
 in Europe and ho
w was it a  pa rt of your  c o nsci ous ne ss?  
A: Well I can actually rememb
er t he day t hat war was decl ared in 
Septe mbe r of 1939.  We we re stil l  
in the country, the fa mily was just
 able, my father was just able 
to send the fa mi
ly away to the 
country so the kids shouldn't have
 to put up wi th the cit y a nd I 
can act uall y rememb
er the, the war  
starting.  At that time I 
was 16 years old, so t hat t here was a 
consciousness of a te
enager.  As with 
most of the people here at that 
time, as I recall it, it 
was  a dist a nt t hin g,  we kne w th e wa r was  g oin g  
on, I mea n, you, we hea r d about th
e bombings, we kne w 
the war was goi ng on, 
we kne w that the  
refugees were co ming here or st
arti ng t o come  here , but ve ry fr
a nkl y kne w very 
little about the 
nuances of it, we knew very little
 about the ships that 
were turned away, th
e one that went to 
Ha vana and wa s turned a wa y.  This 
came later.  If I speak of it now,
 it 's because of
 something that 
I 'd read about, but at the t i me it wa
s a war t hat wa s  in Europe , you 
know, the  war 's i n Eur ope a gai n 
and I guess ,  particul arly at 16 and being involve d 
in track and girls and things like that, I really 
thought ver y  little about the war.  We fol l owe d 
it, you coul dn't hel p but follow it, it wa s in the 
headlines all  the t i me. So we kn
e w about t he Ma gi no( ph) line , we 
kne w a b out t he pr obl e ms of the  
bombings of Engla nd and s o on 
and until  Ameri ca entered t he war ,
 for us it  was ha ppe ning i n  
anot her plac e.  We wer e not , at the ti me , as
 knowl edgea ble as we 
are now about what was 
happe ning in the conce ntr ation c a mps and wit h th
e  Jews.  We kne w of cour
se, about Kristallnacht,  
we knew about Hitler.  In fact 
I remember as a child, listening to
 Hitler, I remember that they 
broa dca st he re, i n the United State s, t hey br oadca s
t some of t he speeches 
and I remember, whet her  
it wa s fro m Nu re mb erg or so
me ot her place, t he absol ute elect ric
ity of this ma n wh en he spoke and

I mu st say I hear the patt erns w
ith s o me of t he pe ople we have around the  Unite d St at es now, you 
can act uall y hear the patt erns , you ca n hear i f you'
ve studie d the patt erns a
nd the things they were  
said, without getting into the politic
s of the United States, 
you could begin to hear how he enthralled 
the pe ople .  Later  on I  was t o s ee 
Nuremberg, later on I was to see th
e stadium, later on I was to see  
the films of all of these,
 these rallies, but we ac
tually rememb er them and 
I can remember to this 
day, sitting in the little fo
yer that we had in an ap
artment in the Bronx and 
listening to this man. 
Q: Any othe r me morie s about that, 
perha ps t hat your fa ther might ha
ve ha d or your mother?   Your  
father might have still had fa mily 
in Russia or any concer
n there might have been
 in the fa mily for 
Je ws i n ge ne ral or s peci fi c people t hat  you kne w?  
A: We ll I think, without be
ing religious Jews, we all,
 always did have
 and still do have
 a feeling o f 
being Je wi sh.  My father di
d not have fa mi ly t here .   Ye ah.  So 
t hat we have always felt a  very dee p  
fe eling of Judaism without being re
li gious Je ws.  My fat her  did sp
eak of other pogroms.  He  was  
brought up i n area wher e the Cossacks were ver y, ver y acti v e and her remember s the raids in the  
little town of Puniaman(ph)
.  I fo und out much late
r in life that I was on
e thirty-second Cossack, 
whi c h was s o methi ng t h at destr oye d 
my brot her when he hea r d it.  
We don't know wh ere the great, 
great , great , great gr andfather was the rapist or wh
ate ver it may ha ve bee n, but we we re one thirt y -
second Co ssack.  In terms of Eu rope, from 1933
 say, unt il the war be gan and I wa s much mor e 
involved cer tainly, i n list ening, we
 really had ver y, as I recall , very
 li ttle discussi on
 about it.  And 
that ma y have been very nor
mal in the family, I just 
don't reme mb er very much. 
Q: You e nlis ted, why did you, what 
were your r eas ons?    Do you re
me mb er spea kin g t o you r fa mil y  
about it?  

A: Oh yeah.  I, as a ma
tter of fact I enlisted beca
us e, ther e was a war , the y wer e be ginni ng to dra ft  
people , my father  ha d spen
t, I guess a year and a ha
l f or  so  i n  Wo r l d  Wa r  1 
as an infa ntryman.  He

wa s wo un de d th ree  ti mes .  T he t hird  t i me  h e  wa s wo
unde d t he y wa nted to ta
ke  his  le g off beca us e  
of ga ngre ne .   And t hat 's  an intere sti ng st ory in 
that he t hen refuse d to sign t he pa per.  And he 
wo uldn't sign the paper and the gangr
ene receded.  He sai d, "I  came 
into this worl d 
with two legs, 
I 'm going out wit h t wo le gs."   The ga ngre ne r ece ded. 
 My father, fr om 1918, 
never we nt to a doctor , 
until he was 83 years old a
nd hurt himself worki
ng in the dress bu
siness, a bolt of 
cloth had fallen 
on his wri st and I ma de hi m go t o
 the doctor  and the doctor said
, " Well  Mr. London, when was t he  
last ti me you visite d a doctor? "  He sa id, "1918."  
 And the doct or sai d, " We l l, you'r e none the wors e  
for it."  My father sa
id to me , "Don't ever 
ge t in the  infantr y.  Do anythi ng 
t o get out of t he infantr y."   
And he  ha d gone t hroug
h three wounds and t he tr enches and of 
course , as e very s oldi er he onl y t old  
funny stori es  about how his mothe r
 s ent potat o panca kes  over seas , you know and t hey arrive d li ke  
rocks, but he never told about th
e t er r or and the horr or of it , but 
he did c o mmunicat
e to me that it 
was pretty awful.  And so I enlisted in, I actually 
enlisted in the enlisted reserve in May of '4 3 and 
was in t he signal cor ps, I enlist ed i n  the si gnal co
rps .   And that probabl y, t hat a nd also getti ng  
pneumonia wh en my  unit we
nt  over seas to go t o  
D-Day, saved my  life, I 
was in the hospital with 
pne umonia , so.  But that wa s the ba
si c reason I enlisted was I knew I 
woul d be dr a fted, but I thought  
I might just as well enlist and ge
t s o me  ki nd of a  bac kgr ound and th
at si gnal c orps ba ckgr ound in 
fact, was the thi ng that  cr eated a 
career for me lat er on. 
 So I  enlist ed and I we
nt  to, i n to t he ar my 
wh ere several things happened.  
One, to ma ke  me under
st and more about anti-
Semitism, because in 
the Bronx pa rticularl y a n d I le ft the Bronx at 17 a
nd pr etty mu ch at 19 I en
listed.  In the Br onx you 
got very little of it, the 
Bronx was very heav
ily Jewish.  I was 
now coming into 
the United States 
ar my, a de mocrac y of s o rts, or fi ght i ng for a de mo
cracy, wher e I began to co
me into anti-Semitism 
in both it's subtle and it
's  over t  for ms .   It was obvi ous i f  you 
were going to be in
 the ar my you wer e 
going to get it.  I mean the anti-Se
miti c jokes t hat suddenl y  starte
d to be told ar
ound me while

some one  tur ned and sa ys , " Well , I don't me an you, I 
don't consider you Jewish,"
 when after all, I a m 
Je wish, is one thing.  The  second thi n g wa s that I , 
aft er t wo ye ars, we nt to OCS.  I ha d gone all the  
wa y fr om... 
Q: Wh at 's  OC S?  

A: Offic er Ca ndi date School.  I 
ha d gone from priva t e to PFC and 
then they busted me back to  
privat e bec a use they di dn't have e nough r oom for 
a PFC you see and I dec i
ded I was going nowher e 
aft er t w o years.  Luckil y 
I wa s te achi ng in sc hool , I  was teac hing
 at officer, at  officer  school  as a 
privat e and a PFC, I was teaching co
lonels and generals and like an 
i diot  I ke pt vol unteering t o go  
over sea s wit h the m.  I wante d to go to Ne w Guin ea, I want ed to go t o Eur ope a nd nobody woul d le t  

me go, I wa s one of ei ght pe ople
 who had a t o p secret cl earance 
with t he Unit ed States ar my, 
teachi ng t his course, so nobody woul
d let me go.  I finall
y decided the only way 
to get out of thi s  
would be  to go i nto Offic er Candid
ate  Sc hool.  So I applied for  Of
fi c e r Ca n di dat e Sc
hool and again 
, in speaking of the, the anti-Semitism in the army
, I was in a company, I wa
s first sergeant in a  
company of 250 officer c andi date s.  
There were 13 Jews a nd t w o blac ks and I, as fir st ser gea nt, was  

allowe d to pick my  roommate.  Yo
u se e, the  ba rracks wer e ma de up
 a n d i f you've  s een barr acks , 
they were made up of 60 beds
, double dec ker a nd one squa d ro
om.  The squa d room was wher e  
there wer e t wo be ds a nd the firs
t s er gea nt and one othe r non- comm
is sioned offi cer woul d be i n the 
squad r oom,  so you had a private room.  And s o 
I had t o be c o me ve ry fri e ndl y with a  ma n from 
Wa shi ngt on D. C. na med Bob Ma c Ne
il(ph) , who happene d to be one 
of the two bla cks a nd havi ng 
been brought up on 
the Bronx, I me an I 
was on a track team with all 
kinds of pe ople , it  made no  
di ffere nce t o  me  a nd he wa s the onl y guy who s e e m
ed t o understa nd inne r city thi nki ng a nd was  
getting the same kind of
 battering fr om the others 
that I was getting, so in 
fr ont of a company of 250 
me n, the ma n wa s Lieut e na
nt Coyne ( ph) , Lie ute nant  Coyne ( ph)  
sai d, "M r. London," I sai d, " Yes ,

sir."  He sai d, " A s first  s ergea nt you can c hoos e a
nyone you li ke to
 spend t he next t hre e  mont hs i n  
the s qua d r oom with you" and I sa
i d, "Mr. M ac Ne il(ph) sir," so in 
front of 250 me n, I picked one of 
the t wo blac ks, i n 1943 or '4 4.  
Thi s  was prett y much unhea r d of
.  Two things happe ned, se veral  
things ha ppe ned.  Numb er one , the day be fore gr
aduation, 12 of the 13 Je ws were wa she d out of 
school , I al wa ys s ay, quite by a cci dent , 12 of 
t he 1 3 Je ws wer e  was he d
 out and one of the two 
blac ks.  The  only t w o pe ople le ft of t hat ent i re 
gr oup starti ng, were Bob Mac Neil( ph)  and me .  At  
the dance, at  the graduati on dan
ce, Cheryl , who i s  my wi fe of 
50 year s now, a s
 you know and I  
knew then, I met her when
 she was 17 and was still in college, 
came to Fort Monmouth(ph) t o  
attend the dance and Bo
b had a frie nd, a  woma n 
na me d Lua(ph) , atte nd the  danc e a nd the y ha d 
dance car ds in those da ys, you act ual l y had a dan ce card s o that you si gne d
 up for t he dance and I  
signed up for a da nce wit h Lua( ph)and she was bl ack al so 
a nd I, I went on t he danc e floor with her  

when our tur n came and t hat was fine and t hen ca
me t he ti me for Bob t o dance wit h Cheryl a nd a s  

she got on the floor with 
him, the floor emptied and 
all the colonels sitting up
 on the balcony looked 
like they we re getti ng na use ous and they wer e le
aning over a nd Bob sai d, 
"Do you want to st op  
dancing? "  You got to r e me mbe r , th
is is in the 40's a nd s he s aid, " N o."  And the y da nce d.  Nothi ng 
ever ha ppe ned, I was  the n as signe d a nd t he n ca me an
 interesting thin
g.  For two year s i n the ar my, I  
wa s a ssigne d to bl ack tr oops.  
I we nt down to the south and I tr
ained with black troops, I went 
over sea s wit h 4000 bl ac k troops.  I we nt to a bl
ack replacement depot.  
I wa s then sh
ippe d to a  
replacement comp any, picking up  
wire behi nd Maucl auc k's ( ph)  th
ir d ar my, the  25
8 signal light 
construction company, which is
 a bl ack company.  I sai d t o a black
 friend of mi ne , "I ha ve a feeli ng 
that after that incident 
at, in OCS, they put N on
 my s ervic e r ecor d for Ne gro."  She sa id, "Ma ybe  
they put ni gger l over  on your ser vic
e recor d, NL."   And that  was, but
 it turned out to be one of the 
great , great ar my experi ences.  I me an, i f you ha d to ha ve a  great ar my e xperi enc e, this was it .  So

all of t his c o me s as a ba ckgr ou
nd of me eting mi ddle Ame r ic a in a
ll of this and being much more  
awa r e of how our  own peopl e fel t  a b
out Je ws , about bla cks .   I mea n, 
bei n g s o i solat ed in t he Br onx, 
I gues s I, it wa s another ope ning 
ex p e rienc e .  No w, t he n whe n I we nt to Eur op e  an d I was t here  
about the time of Nuremberg, I di
d not see combat by th
e wa y, I was very l ucky on that , for four  
years in t he ar my, ne ver to ha ve 
seen combat was very 
l uc ky a nd a gai n I thank my fat he r  for havi ng  
bee n in the s i gnal  cor ps a nd t aki ng, oh there  was 
one funny t hi ng by t he wa y, which ma y or ma y not 
have anyt hi ng to do wit h this but when I gra dua
ted from Offi cer Candi dat
e School as a second  
lieutenant, I was sent back to th
e school again as
 a student, where I had 
written the examinations 
and I had taught fo r several years, 
which is a t ypical ar my t hi ng. 
 I  was now a li eut enant ta ki ng a  
cour se with examinations I had wr
itt en.  I did very well .  In fact
 on one I think I got  one que stio n 
wr ong onc e beca use I , I sloughed.  
Whe n I went to Eur ope wit h the oc c upati on forc es the n, I we nt  
through ___________
_____ Bel gium and the n on 40 and e i ght 
trai ns out to, to Gra f fe na u(ph) i n  
Ba varia , wi t h the 258 si gnal li ght c o nstruction co
mpany.  I be gan to bec o me
 much more a ware of 
sever al thi n gs, number one , of co
ur se by that ti me I was awar e 
of what the Ger m ans had been 
doi ng, I di d see Dac ha u aft er the f
act, I knew all of this existed.  
I never met a Nazi except once,  
though I wa s fir ml y convinc ed tha t  ever ybody had bee n.  Nobody a d mit t ed it, whic h I think will  
come to  pass when we talk about Albert Speer. 
 The  one per son who admitt
ed t hat he had been a  
Nazi and a member  of t he 
Nazi part y I hired as my 
driver in Berlin.  He 
wa s the onl y hones t  ma n I 
coul d fi nd a nd t her ein hangs a  
tale when you talk 
about  what ha ppe ne d at  Nure mberg, what  

happe ned t o  the people who clai me d the y never  
kne w what  had ha ppened.  I went bac k to the  
Uni ted States in 1946 for what
 we l a ughingly cal l rest  and r e cu
perati on because I  got mar ried and 
Cheryl  and I  spe nt 60 da ys here  
on honeymoon, we nt to Wa shington
 t o tr y to get her over  and t he n  
she came over as the first  of what
 she laughingly c alls the de pe nde nt
s.  She then spent two years on

Eur ope with me i n Salz bur g, where  I was  stat
i on ma na ger  of a  ra dio stati on, KOFA on t h e  
Ameri can Forces Net work and t hen
 we nt t o Be rlin wit h h e r as
 Pr ogra m Manage r of Ameri can  
For ces Net w ork, Berlin.  And we
 spent the two years, we were 
ther e during t he airli ft and t he 
Russia n bloc kade.  Things, a s al ways  happe ned, it 's, 
when you're in a situatio
n, it seems  to be a lot 
less important or a lot 
less threatening than it is to peopl
e who are r eadi ng 
about it in the  
Wa shi ngt on Post or  the  Ne w York
 Ti mes.  And though
 we wer e  bl oc ka ded and we did have a n  
airlift when the Russians turned 
the power off at 11 o'
clock at night, 
we lit candles,
 it was that 
si mple .  We fle w out i n 1948 on
 C47 pla nes , wit h our Ger ma n 
Shepher d on our la ps , you see and 
then came back t o the St ates.  
So thi s  was the stor y, 
e sse ntiall y conde ns ed, ab
out t hese years.  Do 
you have a n y other  que st i ons  on t his?  

Q: Mm- h m, if you wa nt to talk a l ittle bit a b
out bec o mi ng awar e of 
Nure mberg, you were in  
Eur ope, part icularl y wha t  di d people  sa y a bout it
, what wer e your t hought s
 a bout it  and a nyt hin g  
about Al bert  Speer beca use after all, you e ve ntual ly
 did int erview hi m a nd we 'll  get t o that, but in  
ter ms of ha vi ng a bac kgr ound. 

A: Ver y good question because a 
lot of what my feelin
g were with Albert  
Speer later on and my 
experience wit h hi m ha d to do wit h 
the t hings t h at ha d happe ned t he
n.  I wa s aware of Nuremb erg, I 
kne w what wa s goi ng on at Nur e mberg, I 
followed it very, very closely.  
So a lot of what I, I felt at 
that time, or a lot of 
my experi ence at that ti me 
had a lot to do in 
turn with my feelings about Speer.  
No w I wa s not day to day involved 
in what wa s going on at
 Nuremberg.  I knew
 what was going on 
at Nure mber g, I  passe d t hrough Nur e mb
erg at t he ti me of t he t rials, 
I knew the trials were going on,  
I sa w the tanks outside, I knew what wa s going 
on at Nure mberg, howeve
r, at t hat ti me  an  
intere sting t hing ha ppe ned, I wa s st

scaffolds to hang the people wh
o wer e found guilt y of ma ssa cr ing 
unar med Ameri ca n s oldier s.  SS 
me n, people  like that a n d I use d to s pend the mo
rning watchi ng the ha ngi ngs .  That is  one of t he  
most interesting things in terms of
 what it 's done t o me t oda y, a m 
I for t he deat h penalt y or agai nst  
the de ath pe nalty, how c oul d I sta nd there i n the mo
rni ng, at six o'cl ock i n the morni n g on t he doc k  
and watch people hange
d, you see, and not 
care?  Th e eye fo r an eye, 
I don't know.  But that had a 
lot to do later on, with when I wa
s as ked to do the  Al bert  Spee r inter vie ws, beca use  i f I  coul d s pe nd  
those mornings, I 
obviously had a deep 
seated anger and hos
tility and a feeling of
 vengeance, to be 
able to sta nd and watch peopl e hange d, who m I di dn
't even know, I me an t hese ar e not even like the  
great murders that we read about 
in the United States to
da y, to wat c h pe opl e ha
nged and to ha ve no  
fe elings while some of th
e sol diers who wer e ther e as honor gu
ards, woul d fai nt.  And my feeli ng s  
then, i f I c ould go bac k to that, i n
 fact I did s o me drawi ngs and sent
 t he m to Cheryl , I we nt ther e an d 
I woul d dr a w t he hangings.  Sure , I wa
s 21 or 22 years old, it
's not an excuse, it's just that that's what 
it was , I 've t hought about  that ofte n and as rece ntl y  
as the last couple of we
eks in talking about death  
penalty and eye for an eye an
d so on and this came    
   back to me 
and sai d, but i f I st ood the re a nd I  
wat che d t his , how do I feel now?
  So Nur e mber g was  goi ng on thr o
ugh this ti me and I know wh at 
the, I of cour se knew even
 then what the results were, I knew 
when they wer e hanged, I  knew about  
Göring taking the pills and commi
tting suicide.  I knew all about th
at then, but it wa
s kind of apart 
fr om ot her t hings, t his was we had won t he war , 
we had t he t r ial, we wo
uld hope it woul d ne ver

happe n agai n and look what
's ha ppe ned.  And I, Al
bert Speer I didn't even 
know.  I knew Göring, I 
kne w Go eb b e ls, I k ne w Hi mmle r, I 
kne w all of the na me s I s hould 
have known.  Speer was a non-
entity to me, if you had mentione
d Albert Speer to me at that 
time , I proba
bly would have said , 
"Yeah, isn't he, isn't he the mini
ster of ar ma me nt s, ma ybe ."  And 
I s ay t h at in 20/20 hindsight , I  
don't  know.  At 21 or 22 
years of age, it's  hard fo
r me  to tell you now.   
Q: If you can go back to the hang
ings a little bit, set that
 scene, what about th
e first time that you 
we nt and how oft e n di d you go a nd 
how ma ny pe ople wer e  hung at a 
ti me and how long woul d you 
stay?  
A: I onl y we nt to t hree , ma ybe four
 and t he n, a s wit h everyt hing el se, 
I mean it's, it isn't a, terrible to 
say, a  novel t y, but  es se nt ially it 's , you know, re me
mbering the time , remember
ing what we  ha d j ust  
bee n thr ough, it wa s a part of, a pa rt, deat h was a 
part of l i fe a nd re me mbe r ing or, I r e me mber t her e  
wa s another thing a nd you'll be t alki n g to pe ople  
who wer e dealing with r efugees , Eur ope was i n 
turmoil, this was not the way it is
 now, you di d not get on tr ai ns, t h
e tra i ns  had no wi ndows , pe opl e 
wer e tryi ng t o find ot her people . 
 I f you tr avel ed from 
one pla ce to anothe r, pe ople we re crowdin g  
ont o pl ane s, I sa w, I sa w, this i s 
something that just came
 bac k t o me , I re me mb er GI MP 's s ho oti ng  
into the air to keep people fr om
 getti ng ont o the GI c ar be ca use t he ot he r cars wer e so cr owde d 
where pe opl e were goi ng fr om Fra nkf
urt to Berlin, fr om Be
rlin to Nuremberg to 
find, to Munich to 
fi nd their relatives.  Reme
mber , e ver ybody was a  displ ace d pe rs
on, i ncl udi ng t he Ger m ans .  And so 
you went from, fr om place to pla
ce a s an ar my person a nd you had 
your own car s, a
ll of with the 
windows bomb ed out.  My first ti
me to Vienna I sat, in the middl
e of the wint er, wit h wi ndows,  
wit h four bl a nket s ar ound
 me .  I mean this 
was the way people traveled. 
 When you look in context  
of what Eur ope was at t hat ti
me, where when th
e trai n st opped a nd pe ople got off a nd r elie ve d  
themse lves at the side  of
 the tracks and got back on the train, 
t hese  were pr etty te rribl e t i me s, so a

hanging was  part of li fe i n this
 whole thing.  No
w, how ofte n did I go, I ca n re me mber t hree , there  
ma y have be en a  fourt h a
nd I  st oppe d.  I didn't  get a kic k out  of
 it, I we nt be caus e
 it  was somet hin g 
to go to.  There was a courtyard.  
It was a very, very dimly lit courty
ard.  There was a scaffold in the 
mi ddle and t here was 
al wa ys , inter es tingl y enough, whethe r I 
call it an honor guar d, but a guar d of 
GI 's who we re standing a t  the side , as  I recall th
er e ma y ha ve bee n 10 or 12 in two rows a nd they  
were the witnesses to it and the, 
the sentence was read out in both 
Ger ma n and Englis h, it mu st ha ve  
bee n in Engl ish too, beca use I re me mber what t he y
 were and t here would be
, a typical one would be 
somebody who ha
d taken two GI's prisoners 
and had, had killed 
them, had shot th
em and was fo un d 
guilt y by a  c ourt and was  ha nge d.  
Then t he hoods  we re put
 over the ir heads, t here  were  us ually t w o  
at a time, both trap doors were sp
rung at the sa me ti me , t here's a pr
iest and then I guess the thing I 
re me mber al wa ys is t he bodies being put in t he c o
ffin a nd one pers on bei ng 
too log for the coffin  
and I would leave .  It took hal f an
 hour.  And the n probab
ly went to breakfast. 
 I mean this is the 
wa y it wa s, you see .  So in a sense this wa s as col d
 blooded as  anyt hing els e that 's eve r  bee n done ,  
but it wa s a g ain ta ken as part of wh
at the daily li fe was at t hat t i me,
 you had trials, th
ere were trials 
all over Germany.  In Bavaria I we
nt to trials with people who ha
d done, I can bar ely re me mber, I  
re me mber doing dra wi n gs of a pri es t  who wa s brou
ght up on trial and the  peopl e plea ding for hi m 
and I used to send these drawing 
back to Cheryl, I still have the dr
awings.  You went because this 
wa s ho w E ur ope  was  c o min
g out fr om the war. 
Q: And your thinking ab
out it in terms of not being disturbe
d by it was that th
ese people committed 
cri mes and t hey ha
d to pay for it? 
A: Yes and at the sa
me time that you kne w that a lot of Am
er icans had committ ed
 cr i mes.  I mean 
they were not the  only one s who s hot pris one
r s and I gue ss the pe opl
e who say we , you won 
there fore , do have a point.  At 
t he sa me ti me  we wo n th ere f or e, 
thank God, you see .
  But I gu ess ,

you know, I gue ss that it all ca me bac k to me l ate
r  on, whe n we starte d to disc uss Nure mberg an d 
wh en  we sta r ted t o ta
lk a bout my goi ng to in
tervi ew Albert Speer. 
Q: Let's talk about that.  
In the interi m, you became 
a film ma ker.  I don't kn
ow i f you wa nt to sort  
of just qui ckly  bri ng us up to 
t hat and the n to t he  point wher e  
you got an assignme nt t o inter vie w 
Albert Speer. 
A: I bec a me ,  actuall y I be ca me ver y quickl y a radi o announce r, a sports cast er, lear ned e nough a bout  

sport s a nd met enough at hletes  to ha
t e sports and we nt in
to disc jockey and th
en int o tel evisi on and 
then by acci dent in 1956, standi ng on the corner 
of 69th Str eet and Ma
dison Avenue, I met my 
company commander fr om Wo
rl d Wa r 2 a nd he said t o me , " Wha
t ar e you doing? "  I said, "I 'm a 
televi sion dir ector ."  And he sa
i d, " Why are you in televi sion, w
hy don't you do fil m? "  And I s aid, 
" Well, I don't know."   And he s ays, " I  own a f
i l m  compa ny."  Intere stingly enough, dur i ng the wa r 
we hated one another, now we're in
 civilian clothes 
and he offe red me a job 
in his film company, 
that 's how I  became a f
i l m maker.  I teach at NYU and I ha
ve tol d my students that 's how you 
bec o me a fil m ma ker.  Can you 
i magine i f I 'd bee n on 70th St r
eet and Ma dison Ave nue, or 68th 
Street and M adis on Avenue, 
I would not be in fil m. 
 I became a docu ment ary 
fil m maker.  I beca me  
interested in the documen
tary, never interested in
 the featur e, mostl y be
c a use  of me e ting I  guess  
people you'd call real people
.  If you do a film on 
hospit als , you're going t o a ctuall y be i n hos pital s,  
you're not going to build sets.  I r
eal l y, though I did do a lot of dra m
atic things on 
tele vision, li ke  
play of t he week, I reall y, never 
real ly enj oyed worki ng wit h actor s
, I a l ways e njoye d worki ng wit h  
real people a nd fi ndi ng out about 
them and I have a curiosity and 
so I be ca me a docume ntar y fil m  
ma ker and i n 1963 was nomi nate
d for an Academy Award f or a fi
l m on Par kinsonis m a nd agi ng 
and t he n agi ng has bee n a subject 
of mi ne for a l ong ti me, I 've done
 c ons ultati ons on it, I 've done 
se mina rs and I've be en consult ant .  But basicall y I '

along on al most all of t hem as a 
part of the company.  I have a curi
os ity, I do ha ve a c uriosity and i n  
19, I guess i n the mi d- 70's , I don't r e me mbe r  when
 Speer 's book  ca me out 
but it was in t he 70's, 
Inside the Third Reich came out and I was called by Mc
Millan, a woman at Mc
Millan by the name  
of Al ma Tr ynor( ph) , who also, in
c i dentall y was J ewi sh, whic h has 
something to do with it and the  
book was c o mi ng out a n d she said, " Let 's ha ve l u nc
h" a nd we  had Chi nes e  lunc h and s he sai d we 'd 
like you t o go overse as  and int erv
i e w Al bert  Sp eer.   By  t his  ti me
 I knew a lot more about Albert 
Spe e r, I mea n, not a l ot, but a l ot mo re.  By t h
is t i me I was now some  ye
ars away from the whole  
thing and I had not read the book, sh
e let me read the, I saw it in 
ma nus cript, I did 
not see it in the 
fi nal book til later, saw it in ma
nuscr i pt and the y had wa nte d to do 
a serie s of fil ms t o  put Albe rt  
Speer on record about a gr
eat many of the th
ings that he had 
written about in the 
book.  I did not 
know at that  ti me t hat there had 
be en a lot of cha nge s made from th
e Ger ma n edi tion, I found thi s  
out  muc h l at er.  And when she  as
ke d i f I  would do it , one  would th
i nk I would have  jumpe d on it , 
actuall y I t ur ned i t  down.  I tur n
ed it down a nd I sa id, "I  couldn't 
do it , I can't  go bac k to Ger ma n y, I  
have great proble ms  whe n I do go ba ck on busine ss." 
  And I had bee n ba ck se veral ti me s on tr ave l  
fil ms a nd on docume nta r i es.  "I reall y woul d pre f er not to go to inter vie w Albert Speer ."  And she  

said, " Well when in your life wo
uld you have a chance to me et a
nd int erview Hitler 's number two 
ma n? "  And I said, " Well  I gue ss I ne
ver would."  And now the curi osit
y begins to ta ke  over , right,  
you're  a fi l m  make r, a docume ntar y 
film maker and you're going to 
fi nd out about this and then it 
occurred to me that ther
e's a very weird, al most surreal  feeli n
g about going to in
terview a man who 
would ha ve had you kil l ed or ha ve 
worke d you to de ath i f he ha d wo
n or if I ha d be en in Europe . 
And I couldn't resist it.  I said, "Yes, I will go."  A
nd at that point I read the book again, I did all my  
resear ch a nd readi ng a bout Nure mber g aga i n, I fo
und t hat I was going to go a nd I would have to  
really set my mind to the right a
ttitude.  I coul
d not go there with the attitu
de that I wish
ed he'd had

hung, whic h I had, but i f I was goi ng to get a nyt hi ng 
fro m hi m, we woul d now ha ve t o have a kin d  
of a hands off, polite attitude.  
I had no idea what he would be 
like and so I went back to  
Hei del berg ( ph)  with  Al ma  a nd  we s p
ent  10 da ys  wi th Albert  Spe er. 
Q: Talk a little bit more about 
how you felt when the 
woman fr om the publishi
ng house said, "I'd  
like you t o go" a nd you s a
id, "No."  I me an, wh y th
e a uto matic  no?   What  wa s going t h rough your  
head? 
A: Well  I proba bly, I  pr oba bly la ughed whe n I  sa
id no, I mean it was a ve
r y stra nge ki nd of a  
request .  I se ldom on a job ha ve sai d no.  I have 
s aid no on fil ms where my ethic s wer e involve d. 
Wit hout sa yi ng what si de  I'm on, but on some of t he 
great issues of the worl
d, s uch as aborti on, the  
Viet na m Wa r and so on, I had r e fus e d fil ms .  I re
fus ed t his on a n e moti onal basi s, t hat I rea lly, 
number one , did not wa nt to prom
o te his book.  Numbe r t wo, t h
ere's t he gut feeli ng t hat I ' m 
unc omfortable in Ger ma ny a nd t hat 's  basic ally it,
 you know.  I gue ss t hough
, t hat t he , the whol e  
idea of, as she said, meeting so
meone who was Hitler's 
number two man, over
whelmed everything 
else a nd I de cide d I woul d go.  But ba sicall y I think 
I 've al wa ys  had a fe eling that i f I s ol d one more  

copy of that book, I'm so
rry I did.  On the other 
hand, I'm all for people wr
iting what they feel and, 
you know, a nd we have t hat now ev
e n wit h the David Ir ving book, 
though Sai nt Marte n s(ph) shoul d  
probably never have taken it in the first place, th
e, the title, the David Irving book is on Goebbels  
the one  on Goebbels , whic
h is a Holoca ust r evi s i onis t , he 's t he 
great  Hol oca ust r evi si onist .  I have  

no pr obl e m wit h hi m wri ting, I can
't s t and t he ma n, but you see  wh
a t  I 'm tal king about , no pr obl e m  
with the book coming ou
t, but why am I publiciz
i ng t he  book?   At t he  sa me  ti me , per haps I could 
get some of the answers 
to which I had always fe
lt I would like some an
swers and understanding 
also this was going to 
be a bright man, thi s 
wa s goi ng t o be a man who 
had reall y t h ought about  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428

what he was  goi ng t o sa y and that c an c o me lat er,
 we c an t alk a bout that, beca use I  have ma n y  
fe elings about th
at.  So I we nt. 
Q: How di d you pre par e yoursel f e m
otionally to meet hi
m in a some what ope n 
wa y?   An d wa s tha t  
your goal  or  did you sa y t o yoursel f
, well  I 'm goi ng to ha ve opini ons
 about this man 
a n d I just , I ' m 
not going t o get ri d of t he m, I ' m j u
st  going to put them to the si de. 
 How di d you pre pare  yours el f t o  
do that?  
A: That, it's again, talkin
g to yourself and saying 
you know, what is
 your attitude go
ing to be and I 
had done enough int ervi ews to 
sa y, oka y, for the  mo me nt , though I 
ha ve an e mot iona l conte xt i n  
this one, I am just 
not going to ever show
 hostility and by the way, there 
is later, we'll talk about his  
reacti on t o me and my r eaction t o
 hi m, after ten days, 
because he was 
ver y per ceptive about how I  
fel t  and I wa s ver y perc e ptive a bou
t what he wa s  doing.  
So i t  was a ha nds off 
thing, I mean it was 
no Al bert- b uddy, Mel- budd
y t hing, you ha ve t o  underst and that
 a nd t h at too is a part of our 
relations hip t hat we c an t alk a bout.  I arrive d in 
Heidel ber g(ph) and my cli ent Al ma a r r i ved t her e, I  
think that da y later or t h e next da
y, I don't rec all , but t he firs t th
ing we wer e  to d o wa s to meet  
Albert Speer  at the hotel and we were  to go to di
nner.  And I was excit ed, 
in a strange way, I mean 
after all, it's  if you'd 
said you're going to meet
 Adolf Hitler I would be ex
cited in a strange way. 
This was not just  meeting some bo
dy who was  the pre sident  of a  
corporation.  I came down from 
the, fr om my  room, Alma was s
till up in her room.  I came down fr
om my room and I was sitting in 
the lobby when he c a me  in 
with his wife Margaretta 
and I 'll never for get the 
reaction of the staff. 
They absolutely were enchanted with this ma n.  This 
is after the war, this is 
after Nuremberg, this is  
after he got out of Spandau and th
e greeting of t h e mana ger c oul d not ha ve bee n mor e  effusi ve .  I  
wa s introduc ed to hi m, we wer e, s hook hands , I 
met his wi fe, we s hook ha nds .  Al ma c a me dow n  
and we went to di nner.  We went
 t o di nner  at a resta ura nt of 
hi s choos i ng, whic h a gain set t he

pattern for all the time
 we  wer e  i n Hei delb e rg( ph)
.  Everybody i n the rest aur a
nt was at l e ast 50 or 6 0  
years old.  The owners, as I recall were at least 60
 year s old and there f or e were of hi s gene ration.  
He ha d chos en a r esta ura nt wher
e the  greeti ng would be a bs ol utely the top greeti ng tha t he c oul d 
get, it was the great customer coming in of any restau
ra nt, here  is one.   I, th
at was the first startling  
thing, was that these people still 
admired and probably a
dored this man and th
at was a little shaky,  
contrasted with the fact that fr
om that point on, everywhere el
se we we nt in Hei delberg( ph) , 
whether it was to have a Coca- Col a 
in a small bar or in 
the cas e of my clie nt Al ma , ha ving her hair  
done one da y, e very ti me we wal ke d into a pla
ce, the young pe ople wa lk
ed out .  The wor d got  
around town and this is ironic, th
e word got around t o wn t hat  fri end
s of Albert Sp eer were there. 
This Jewish friend from the Bronx was therefore 
i gnored by most of t he pe
ople who we re in thei r  
20's a nd 30's .  Al ma 's hai r dres se
r wal ked right out  on her .  She  ha
d made an appoin
tment, came in, 
they s a id, " That 's Al ber t  Spe e r 's fri end" a nd t h ey 
walked out.  And so th
ere was this incredible 
separation of the, so there was th
is incredible separatio
n of ge ne rations a nd very obvious one .  Now 
I was there for 10 days a
nd t here we r e several ti mes tha t  we ha d di nner  wit h hi m.  M ost  of the ti me 
we  di d have  dinner  at hi s home , whi ch wa s al so a 
stra nge e x perie nce .  I met  s o me of his  chi l dre n . 
He seemed quite distant from the ch
il dren too.  I have a 
fe eling  fr om the shor
t conversations, their 
politics were quite different fr om 
his.  I have a feeling also, afte
r 20 years in Spandau, he had a 
great , great distance fr om the chil dr
en, I think there was an emotiona
l di stance.  That was a feeli n g, 
I me an, you never know.  His wi fe
 Margaretta was the cl assic, we
ll - me aning, polit e  Ger ma n fra u. 
She  ne ver was cl ose t o a ny of our cr e w.  She ne ve
r wa s cl ose t o us , s he did what s he ha d to do and 
he in turn was always po
lite, always wore a suit 
or a jacket, which meant 
I always wore a suit . 
The se da ys perhaps  we 'd be in bl
ue  jean s, bu t we al way s wo re a

almost entirely, talking an

on film.  Hitl

an artist and we did a film
 also later on, whic
h I'll talk about, on architect

Q: An d who wr ote down the questions

wa s t hat your clie nt, di d you have a  s ense  that
 t he re were  a ny subj ects  that wer e s kirte d? 
A: I  set  up t he que stions  basi call

ears.  I me an now, finall
y, I ha ve a cha nce to, I  
have a chance to speak to Hitle

n and I'm going to as
k him questions, which 
bec o mes a di ffi cult t hing, beca use he had spent his 
20 years , let 's go back t o
 Nuremberg, the man at 
Nure mberg and i f  I ma y, the  questi
on I had, i f I go bac k, i f  I  can 
j ust digress for a mi nute is why 
wa s Göring sente nce d to death,
 okay?  Well, he wa s a very 
well known ma n and VonShur ak( ph)  
and all the peopl e there, why were
 they se nte nce d to de ath a n d w
hy did t wo or t hree of the m get  
away with 20 year s 
on Spanda u?   My feeli ng the n, as my 
fee ling now, e v en a fter me e ting hi m, is  
that he s houl d have bee n hange d
 too.  But a very i ntere sting thing ca me up, I asked hi m a questi on 
that I t hink wa s the  ke y and Gi dda Sera ny( ph) i n her  book 
Albert Speer; His Ba
ttle with Truth, 
brings it up, I think it 's on page 167 and I woul d 
like to read to it to a 
mo ment .  "The Ne w Yor k  
Ti mes , whe n  he die d, pri nted a n obit uary a nd a n 
editor i al, bot h of whic h s aid Alber t  Speer was t he  
only man in Nure
mberg to say he was guilty.  
Sitting on a lawn in
 Heidelberg(ph) I asked them the  
question which started, you were 
the only man at 
Nuremberg to sa
y you were guilty.  He stoppe d 
me at t hat  point and said, I didn'
t  sa y I was guil ty, I sai d I  was resp
onsible ."   And for all  the  ye ars I  
have been going over the nuances
 between guilt and responsibilit
y and obviously there is a bi g 
di ffere nce  a nd i n Gi dda  Sera ny's(
ph)  book, s he tr ies to, i n a s ense ,
 come up wit h t he answer  as to  
why Speer  did not  get  se ntenced to

know thi s ha d ha ppened.  Ev
ery singl e one s aid, well
, no, yes  he wa s doi n g hi
s job, but all this was 
happening beside him.  Speer wa
s the only man who adm
itted he knew somethin
g about it.  "Speer  
wa s not ," s he says, " S peer was not, as is some
ti mes clai med, the only one of t h e accused at 
Nuremberg to feel and admit to gu
ilt,"  by the way, she 
uses the word guilt a
nd I questioned her on 
that, " but hi s admis sion, even 
t hough muc h too generaliz ed, wa s re mar ka ble, beca use  he wa s the  
onl y one, who by ma king it, riske d 
fat ally infl ue nc ing the court 's se
nte nce , whi ch for the other s who 
accepted gui lt, Hans Fra

s inevitable."  He was the onl y one 
who sai d he  kne w any of thi s was going on.  He
 kne w that slave la bor wa s bei ng used a nd in a  
sense, he was the only one t hen 
who stood apart fr om all  of t he ot
her s, because i f you hear t heir 
excuses, I  mean t his is 
absolute insanity that th
ese  people clai med t hat not hi ng we nt on, when a ma n 
who was i n char ge of t h e concen
tr ati on ca mps di dn't know what was going on i n the c onc entra tio n 

camps, so that, whatever  the r eas
ons, he wa s a l wa ys qui
ck to say t hat  he ha
d not admit t ed guilt , but 
responsibility and I wr
ote a letter to the New York
 Times as you know, whic
h covered that and it's  
always  been a very ke y point  in 
my  fe elings about Albert Speer. 
Q: How di d you c o me to under sta nd 
how he di ffe rentiat ed be t wee n the t w o?   Why di d he stop you 
wh en you asked that question, say, 
" N o, I didn't  sa y guilt ."   I  me an, 
what was t he di fference to hi m? 
A:  The di fference t o hi m was that 
if he had said he was 
guilt y, eve n at that poi nt, e ven a fte r the fact , 
then he  was  as guilt y of doi ng it , or
 having a guilt for havi
ng done it as all of th
e other s .  By sa ying 
responsible , he wa s one of t he  pe opl
e who had it happen.  And 
I think there's just th
at thin level.  In 
other words, I see it as very much 
the sa me, i f you wa nt to
 know t he truth, but it was t his ve ry thi n  
level that I think he felt, in hi
s own mi nd.  The proble
ms  th at I h a d 
wi th  Al bert S p
eer and I must  
give Gi dda Sera ny( ph) for he r book 
is that she spent four
 year s wit h hi m, I  sp
ent 10 days.  When I 
left, a nd we 'l l go back t o the ot her t hi ngs l ater , bu
t  when I le ft, he as ke d my
 client how s he thought

k we got everyt hing and a s you  
know, we were out to do a seri

about  Albert Spe e r ? "   She said, 
"Ye s."  I sai d, " He hi des  everyt hing he feel s be

years to come up with all the answers.  You talked
 about Hitler and the Je

you tal ke d a bout a nyt hing a bout sl

we cut the little _______
_________, we had s o me in
teresting experiences, one
 a ft ernoon he sai d, "I  
would like t o show you some of 
my home movi e s" and I sai d, "Oh, 
how marvel ous Her r  Speer, let ' s  
go i n a nd l o ok a t  s o me ho
me  movie s ."  And so we
 went into hi s living room, it wa s a rather nice 
house by the way, the house was on
 a hill in Heidelberg(ph), it wa
s a fa mily home and they'd had 
for I guess ma ny year s.  The onl y pr oble m wit h i t
 was when t here was a st
or m over Fr ankfurt the 
airpla nes use d to c o me over a nd cir cl e and you c oul
dn't rec or d.  But aside  fr
om that we sat on the 
lawn wit h t h e bir ds  chir ping and we
 we nt i nsi de and  we we nt  to l o
ok at the home movies.  An d he 
showed me the home movies of 
Albert Speer a n d Adol f Hitl er 
inspecting the tiger tanks on the 
Russian front.  And I was a little star
tled be this because I mean ho
me movies are home mo vies but 
this is watching his trip 
with Hi tler to t he  Rus sian front .  Lat er he said, " Would you like t o see s o me  
of Adol f Hitler 's drawings?"  And this was toward 
the end of the visit, we 
went to inside and again  
he t ook out a ll the se dra w ings .  
Hi tler was a t erribl e artist  by t h e wa
y, terrible.  Th
e dra wings , a nd a  
fa sci nating t hing ha ppened, which 
ki nd of lea ps for ward, Al ma d

drawings back to the United St

on the walls during the exhibition at the 
Hunti ngt on- Hart for d Museum, whi ch wa s then at  
59t h Street  and Columbus Cir cle a nd t hat we  
would have a 
demonstration or an 
exhibition of Hitler's drawings. 
 So she arrive

"Adol f Hitl e r 's dra wings ."  And 
t he y said, " Oh, we 'v e ha d e nough

and t he y pas sed her t hrough.  But agai n, t he dra w

fa scinating.  His interviews were 
fine, I mean, I got as much as I 
thought I coul d get , but there was  
one t hat we did whe r e he  was re ally i n his ele me n t.
  I aske d hi m, as Gidda Sera ny( ph) a ske d hi m, a s  
ma ny report ers as ke d hi m, how he coul d wor k wi
t h thi s monst e r, I  me an how c oul d you be a  
member of Hitler's gr
oup and work your way 
up and he came up with a 
very interesting answer an d 
I guess  in all  fairness , you have  to
 accept  it.  He said, " How woul d 
you fe e l  i f you 
wer e  a 29 ye ar  
old architect  and the head of stat
e ha d as ke d you to be his a r c hitect
? "  He  said, " Y ou're  ver y proud 
of the he ad of state ,"  he  said, "re me mber, t his is.
.."  And thi s is all be for e the war reall y got unde r  
wa y, this  wa s all i n t he e arly days a n d as  a 29 ye
ar ol d, i f you look at t he  pe ople  who foll ow the 
presi de nts, who foll ow t he congr es
s p eopl e, look a t  all your young pe
ople , some of t he m ar e reall y 
very arrogant.  I've seen people come in to an 
air p ort and sa y, "Ye ah I want
 a car because I 'm wit h  
Ji mmy Cart er 's  ent ourage."   A
nd they're 22 years old going on
 eight, you know a nd you can 
underst and at 29 this ma n was sudde
nly re cogniz ed by the hea d of state.  So we we nt to the  
drawings that he had done and we did a film on ar
chitecture in a totalitarian society and I think th e 
thing that amazed me is 
if I was startled by Hitler's
 dra wings , which were  so
 bad, I was even more  
startled by the scale of everythi
ng that goes on in a totalitarian
 society.  Going back to the 
demonstrations at Nuremberg 
in the 30's, with the torc
hl ights, a nd I did see  t hat
, that stadium, it's an 
incredible stadium.  Goi
ng ba ck to t he sta dium a t  Nure mber g, goi ng ba ck to everyt hing they e ver  
built , which wa s al wa ys  l arger  tha n t h e per son, ev
erythi ng that  Speer  de si
gned, which wa s going to 
be in Berlin, right after German
y won the war was on a scal e t hat 
belies i magination.  For example, 
a dome whi ch woul d be  on the Unt e rdinli nden( p h) 
and woul d hol d 100,000 pe
ople.  Just a dome .  
And then the Unterdinlinden(ph) wo
uld now be made into a military 
avenue of about 48 lanes wide, 
with cannon on each 
side.  Everything he show
ed me was totalitarian, wa
s fascist.  It's what  
Mussolini did, it's what 
Hitler would do and this ma
n involved hims
elf in things th
at were beyond  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
22 
 
imagination in terms of 
scale.  I  mean a skyscraper 's a skys
c r aper , when you tal k a bout a dome ,  
under whic h 100,000 people can 
stand comfortably, you're talk
i ng about  a  pr etty big dome. 
Q: What was he like when he sh
owe d you the se dra wings , di d you 
se nse pride or per haps a bit of 
embarr assment, what was he li ke? 
A: He woul d not ha ve t ake n the dra wings out i f  it were e mbarrassi ng.  He took the drawi ngs out  

with pride, he 
showed them with pride.  He showed them
 matter-of-factly.  Speer was a very matter-
o f- fact ma n wit h so me o ne lik e me .  I re me mb er  
hi m s mili ng oc casi ona l l y, c ertai nly, I re me mber 
hi m being war m, but he showed pri d e in that.  I me
an, to show me Hitler's 
dra wings , then he said  
Mel must have a curiosity to se
e Hitler's drawings, which I did. 
 So I would say there was no  
embarrassment about anything.  Wh
ich gets back to that whole th
ing of guilt a
nd responsibility 
doe sn't it?   I  didn't  find a ny feeli
ng that he was sorry for 
it .  I certai nly would l ove t o have ha d hi m 
say he was s orry the y l os t
 the war, but you, you'd 
never get t hi s from hi m.  He was ver y  wit hdr a wn 
in that sense  but  very bri ght and 
all  his answers wer e t here.  I have
 not heard the ta
pes in a lot o f 
years , you have , rece ntly, I sent the m  down withou
t heari ng the m a nd at so
me point I think I'd like  
to hea r  the m  again.  And I'm sorr y t w o tape s ar
e mis sing be ca use I don't know whi ch t wo t ape s are  
missing.  If I fi nd them, they'll go
 down.  But the  10 da ys we nt ver y comforta bly, sha ll I say?   I 
re me mber a not her t hing, I a m a 
hugger, I me an you know, I am a 
toucher, I'm a hugger.  We ll, I  
didn't hug him,  but wh en we left
, Ma rgarett a was  sayi ng goodbye to
 the crew and she had really 

bee n a  ver y nice  woma n, I me an 
you know, she  wasn't, like  my moth
er or my grandm
other, she was  
a nice woman.  She t ook care of t he 
cre w, s he fe d us , she wa
s at the table with 
us .  She said ver y 
little.  And so, i mpulsi ve l y I we nt to hug her a nd that 's
 whe n I realize d that  this was really a job, I  
wa s hugging a rod of steel.  This
 wa s  no woma n wh
o wa s goi ng t o hug me ba
ck.  So whatever her 
fe elings wer e about t his Je wish 
pr oducer , I don't know, but t h at was, t hat , I always  re me mber , I ca n 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
23 
 
re me mber it vivi dly, I ca n re me mber
 where we were because i t was ki
nd of a sl ap i n my face that, 
but I a m i mpulsive t hat way a nd 
I hug people , I hug men I l ove , I 
hug wome n, I  hug. 
 Because I like  
to t ouc h.  But not t here .
  He  and I 
s hook ha nds. 
Q: What about the mood and also 
the eye contact, what 
was that like for you and how did you feel 
aft er a day, five, si x hour s of fil m
ing, how did you 
feel after war ds? 
A: That 's a wonder ful questi on beca
use I think what I did is I think that a ft er the da y, I blanke d out . 
I did not do, I could not have sp
oken to you a ft er  the 
inter vie ws  as I 'm speaki ng t o you now, 2 0  
some odd years later.  It was a job.  I hate to sa
y it  that wa y be caus e you know, it was my j ob, I did 
it, people use that  as an
 excuse, but it was a j ob an
d i f I wa s going t o do t he  job pr operl y, I had t o do 
it as a profe s sional.  Ot he rwis e I shoul d not have 
t ake n the job.  And s o ho
w di d I fe el through the  
day?   I wa s intere sted, I  wa s i nte
re ste d i n what he  ha d t o say, 
the relationship wa
s comfortable at 
that ti me.  At t he end of
 t he da y I have , we we nt around Hei d
elberg( ph) , we went to dinners , we  
really never disc uss ed it or i f we di sc usse d it I c a
n't re me mber havi ng disc ussed i t  in a ny dept h now.  
But all of the, the days were very
 comforta ble da ys, the  weat her t urn
ed out to be gr
eat, it was June 
as I recall , the weather t urned out to be great . 
 He was al ways very, ve
r y char mi ng and I thought 
more about what  quest i ons I 'd as
k the ne xt day but ne ver di d I ever
 feel like Gi dda Serany(ph) di d 
in four years  in being abl e to brea k through s o me 
of this .  The  man c oul d not be broke n through.  
And whet her  he then e ve ntuall y sai d or felt he wa s 
guilt y as she says , he di d not at that ti me .  Di d I  
feel when I l eft ther e that  they sh
oul d have ha nged hi m?   Yea h.  I fe el
 it to this day.  I think he got 
away wit h murder .  For whatever 
reasons, he got away with mu rder. 
 He wa s usi ng sla ve  labor.  Hi s  
excuses for that of cour
s e, i f  you've  hear d t he t a pes are you 
know, t his was a war effort, he had 
not hing to do wit h the day to da y things i n the 
factori es, he had t o provi de pe opl e so they coul d 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
24 
 
provide for the war effort.  He  was a loyal Germa
n, whic h he should ha ve bee n.  I gues s pr oba bl y 
even after this, I'll think of things that will co
me  ba ck now that I  di dn't
 t hink of 20 ye ars  a go. 
Q: Di d you have any s e nse of hi
m havi ng an i n ner str uggle  and per ha p s sa y, being afraid of it  
almost and saying no, I st
ill have to believe that wh
at I did was 
okay, or did you have
 a sense of that  
goi ng on i nsi de of Al bert  Spe er?  
A: Yea h, I would ne ver  kno
w what wa s going on insi de of Albert
 Spe er , he had l ear ned t o contr ol  
that a nd whether he did or not, I 
know that in future in
te rvi ews, li ke i n this lat est book, he had 
learne d t o ba ck off wher e  he di dn't wa nt to a ns w
e r  and eve n i f you pursued 
it, he woul d go onl y so  
far .  Did he  have a n i nne r tur mo
il?  I don't know, I don't know.  Idon't know if the ma n felt that he  
wa s sorr y he  was ever convi
ct ed, he wa s sorr y they ha d e ver l ost
, I ha ve no idea and I would ne ve r  
know t his of Albert Spee r.  He ha ndl ed hi ms el f ve
ry well in those interviews
.  He di d what he was  
supposed t o do, I di d what I was s u
ppos ed t o do.  If I had t o do 
it all over agai n, I probably woul d 
come up wit h e ven more  drivi ng 
quest i ons  tha n I  di d then bec ause 
I know a l ot mor e now tha n I did 
then and it 's  very di ffic
ult to go into an interview like that
 a s a docume ntary fil m ma ker, ha ving 
studied everything you ca
n about it and still think that you've 
covered everything, you can't cover 
ever ythi ng.  The r e are the  ol d,
 I s houl d  ha ve , I  coul d have. 
Q: Why do you thi nk he  did t he i n
ter vie w, or why di d he do, beyond
 perhaps t he obvi ous reas ons, I  
me an the  ma n didn't  ha ve  to do 
interviews, but appare
ntl y he  di d t he m so
me wh at fr equently. 
A: I thi nk t h at they, I thi nk a part
 of it, well first I think Albert Sp
e er di d his  intervi e
ws partially for 
the re asons t hat you ki nd of touc hed on a mome nt ag
o of being able to just
ify Albert Speer and his  
bac kgr ound and what  he  did.  Parti all y beca use I  t hin
k he was convinced that i f
 you're going to sell 
the book a nd, I  mea n t his
 is a ver y pr agmatic reas
on, t hat you're going t o 
sell your book and you're  
goi ng t o c onvinc e people  
to go buy a  book of, the

you have to do me dia tours,
 you ha ve to do t hese  intervi ews.  
I think hi s publisher ha d a lot to do 
with this.  I think the publisher bo
th i n Ger ma ny a nd M cMill a n(ph) he
re in the United 
State s sa id i f 
you're going to do this book, you 
a re going t o have t o do i nterv
i e ws .  And he  di d a ser i es  of  
interviews ri ght after t hat for tel evi si on and for 
r adio and di d the m la ter 
on, the r e wa s a se cond  
book, whic h I wa s not involve d wh
it a nd I know nothi ng a bout .  I 
ha d had j ust a bout e n ough at one 
poi nt, but I think that was it and I do bel i eve th
at ther e was a feeling 
that he was now bei ng  
recognized.  Reme mber  Albert Speer
 also, i f  he 'd bee n 
hanged, would ha ve  gone
 do wn wit h Göri ng  
and all the rest of 
t he m, that woul d have bee n it .  Al bert  
Spee r ca me  out a t  the  end of 20 yea r s i n  
prison a nd had a cha nce to be  rehabi
litated, I don't know 
if it was that, but to 
at least to a person 
agai n, i n t he soci ety and wit h enou
gh clout in the societ y 
t o be  inter vie we d by the  pre ss , to as k hi s 
opi nions.  I don't t hink i n that se
nse  it 's a ny di ffe rent fr om a n y of 
the people who ca
me up in post 
war Ger ma n y and were i ntervi e wed .  I think h e  al
s o wa s gras pi ng and gropi ng to try to find hi s wa y 
back to his family.  I me
ntioned that the impression 
I got of his si x c hil dre n, 
all of whom were born 
be for e he went to pri son and ther e for e didn't se
e hi m for 20 years except t wice a year , were very, 

very dist ant and al most i solate d fr
om hi m.  I ne ve r got t he feel ing wh
ile I was there, in 10 days that  
there was any gr eat l ove, the kind 
of l ove  you see ,  al mo
st in a physical  love, a  touching or a  ki ss, I  
never s a w t h at.  Now tha t  may be onl
y the Germanic thing and

A: That's interesting.  If I were
 to put it, that's a 
marvel ous que stion bec aus e I woul d sa y ther e was  
always a sense of sadness.  I 
don't know whether the sadness wa s 
created by 20 years lost without 
the family, now back to the fa mily
.  You have lost 20 years, yo
u ha ve c o me out  of Spa ndau and 
you've lost 20 year s.  I ne ver got 
the feeling of a sense of
 joy, a sense of fr eedom, a sense of release. 
But you'r e s aying tha t  now, i f I ha d t o put it i n 
my own word, I think there 
was, over the 10 days, a 
sens e of sa dness .  Even a nd a se nse of propri ety, 
of a proper huma n bei ng who, when he we nt to the  
restaurant s, as I mentioned, was co
rdial, was pleasant.  But was neve
r hi J oe, you kn
ow, how, nice  
to see you, ever, al ways proper.  
Just as the suits, betw
ee n the  two of us , both
 of us we aring suits , 
wer e always  prope r.  We never c alle d one a not he
r by first na me.  We never touched more t han a  
hands hake.  I al ways had the underl yi ng feeli ng of 
if ha d won I  woul d be de ad
, but I pushed it aside, 
I ha d t o.  And intere stingl y e nough, on the  da y t o da
y disc ussions, it was j ust
 like  s pea ki ng t o you, it 
wa s fi ne , it wa s we tal k ed.  I me an he wasn't goi
ng to do anythi ng to me and I was n 't  going to 
strangle him and so we put that 
asi de right at the beginning and we
 were going to try to get to the 
bottom of something to which we
 r eally ne ver  go t o t he botto
m, bott o m and neve r woul d and 
nobody ever  will , a bout Albert Sp
eer .  The cl osest one who got to 
it wa s Gidda Sera ny( ph) a nd eve n  
there you get very little of Albert 
Speer.  Course when he
 wanted, when he wa
s annoyed or upset, 
he l et her  know it .  And s he 
spe nt four  ye ars wi th hi m. 
Q: What you've sa id t o me be fo
re our int ervi ew began,
 you c an't i magi ne spe ndi ng four year s with  
hi m. 
A: Oh well , yea h, in speaki ng of Gi dda Se rany( ph)
 spe ndi ng four year s  wi
t h Albert  Speer, I am 
al most over whel med at t he 
professionalism and the bu
lldog grit it must have take
n to do this
, in four 
years t hat, I coul d not ha ve spe nt f
our years with Albert Speer.  Well
, I 'm also type A, so that , you 
know I, 10 days i s quite e
nough, t hat 's  usually...  The thi ng t hat 
she did t hat I  coul d not do and that I  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
27 
 
think is critical to any, any journali
st or any fi lm maker who intervie
wed Albert Speer, has to realize 
that none of us  could ha ve done
 what she did, whi ch 
was to question him and then move to the 
people he mentione d in his ans wer s 
to find out if A, they were true
, i f B the s e people ha d seen the m  
and rememb ered t hem 
as Al bert Speer reme
mbere d the m a nd t hen to go t o
 the ar chi ves and find out  
if either one was telling the truth.  This takes a lot 
of time and a lot of, of, 
of digging and she did it  
and I admire the book as 
a result.  I mean the bo
ok is overwhelming and I'
ve written to her as you 
know a nd I 've gott en an ans wer  a nd I  woul d l ike  t o 
me et wit h her,  in  a  sh a r
ed experience, mine 10 
days and her s four ye ars .   I woul d like to fi nd out
 how s he c o uld s pe nd four 
years there, doing it. 
And in r eadi ng the book and I re ad
 it carefully, I'm back in the mi
ddl e aga i n, re adi ng it  care full y, I  
just quot ed from pa ge 167. 
 I 'm fa sci nate d by t he  fact , the det e r m
i nati on a nd the fact t hat she ke pt  
up wit h thi s thing and qu
estioned eve rythi ng down the line , incl
udi ng the wives a nd the chil dre n of  
some of t he people who had be en at Eagl e 's Nest  a
nd Bertas ga rten( ph) .  By th
e wa y, I di d vi sit t here  
when I was stationed in Salzburg 
and I, Bertasgarten(ph), Hitler's Ea
gle's Nest home, or his hideout,  
the Eagle's Nest in Bert asgar t en( ph) , there they 
had des t royed the SS barr acks ri ght be low a nd the 
Eagle's Nest was still ther
e and I remember 
going through sayi
ng, well Hitler was here, you know , 
this is where Hitler was. 
 That  was kind of an unr e al experie nc e
, this was speaking 
to the man.  But  
getting back to your, 
your said, did I see a sadness, I think ye
s, I think deeply th
ere was, there was a 
sadness, t her e possi bly was a feeling t hat people 
didn't quite under sta nd w
hy he had done some  of  
these things.  Witnesses sa
yi ng i f  you were  29 a n d th
e head of state asked you t o be hi s architect , it  
wa s, it was a n experie nce  I gues s 
that any of us , pa rticularl y the  
Jewi sh boy fr om the Br onx would 

always c arry with me and I do.  
And when I found the ta pes , I  c
oul d not be lieve , I didn't  know wha t  
had happened to them an
d there are still two missin
g, I'm going to find th
em.  I don't 
know where 
the fil ms a r e , I woul d like to ha ve the m.  Actuall
y, what I woul d like t o have is the origi nal , the  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
28 
 
unc ut fil m.  The  10 minute c uts are not hing mor e
 tha n 10 minute  cut s.  I woul d li ke  to fi nd t h e  
origi nal fil m somewhere.  I don'
t know i f that 's pos sibl
e, it 's  too far a wa y.  Fil m wa s pr oba bly 
destroyed. 
Q: How di d the e xperie n ce a nd per h
a ps not eve n i m me diat ely, but 
me eti ng hi m, spe nding those  10 
days with Al bert Speer, how di d th
at cha nge your underst anding of 
Nazi Ger many?  Or  perhaps of  
one  Nazi?  

A: Let 's put i t  this wa y, I 've never  understood Nazi
 Ger ma n y, j u st as I ha ve never underst ood, I ha ve  
never unders tood the ki nd of de struc t ion that we
nt on in Nazi  Ger ma ny, a l most the engine ers at  
work.  I ca n more easi l y under sta nd Bi a fra , I 
can e ve n underst and Vi etna m, I ca n under sta nd 
Nigeria, I can understand tribal warfare.  I 
don't like it and I think it'
s horrendous, but I can 
underst and this be cause people do 
react this way.  Bosnia is the 
classic example of t he probl ems of 
100 year s ba ck.  But when I look at Naz i  Ger ma ny 
and I haven't c ha nge d my opini on there, I felt  

exactl y t he same way before an
d I feel exactl y the 
same wa y now.  The anti-Semitism, anti-
Semitism in the firs
t place I find difficult to 
understand.  I find anti anythi
ng of a group or a race, 
di ffic ult t o under sta nd.  But  whe n
 you look at what Nazi Ger many 
di d, with s o met hin
g like, was it  
600 c once ntr ation c a mps or plac es of deat h, when you 
l ook at t he us e of sla ve labor, when you look 
at the deliberate way in which th
ey did this, I still don't understand 
it.  I had known people who left  
Ger ma n y, who are  not J e wis h, beca us e 
they understood that 
thi s was a country t hey
 c oul dn't li ve i n.  
If it ha ppe ne d i n my c ountry, I  ha ve
 often said I probably
 would ha ve  to l eave .  So ha s it cha nged, 
did it change my feeling about Al ber t  Spee r?   Befo
re I met Albert Spee r, I had no rea l  feeli ng of 
Albert Speer .  He was a person.  I kne w he wa s, in
 fact I knew hi m as the 
Minist er of Ar ma me nt s, I 
had for gott e n that he wa s an arc hite
c t , I t hen, a s you begi n t o r ead yo
u rea l i ze, yes , yes , yes , I know 
he is .  I  ha d no feeling a bout hi m 
be fore.  M y feel ing about hi m now 
i s a r ather dist ant one .  I don't  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
29 
 
fe el any great warmth toward, towa
rd him and that experi
ence.  I still can't un
derstand how and wh y 
he di d it.  I n ter ms of Na z i s m and wha t  happened 
i n Germany, I cannot for t h
e li fe of me  understa nd  
how any country, how the people in a ny countr y c
oul d do what  they did a nd how t hey di d it and the  
methods in which they did it.  Th
is is not meeting some
one in war, it's not 
even the SS man killing 
an unar med Ameri can sold
ier or an Ameri can sold
ier in Melai(ph).  This
 is something that is 
beyond my understanding.  
So in that sense there's 
been no real chan
ge.  I still have difficulty when  
I go back to Germany.  I s
till have, I mu st admit this, 
I have difficulty in th
e following way.  I've 
had to go back t o Ger ma ny on se veral , a nd t h
is had nothing t o do w
ith the younger German s 
beca use wha t  happens to me
 is whe n  I go to a hotel lobby and I 
see people my age, I 'll be 73 in 
August, whe n I see pe ople
 my a ge si tting there i n suits a nd drinking and having a gr eat ti me, I 
me ntall y put  SS on their l apels .   
And I'm sorry, this is th
e way it is and I've spent a lot of time ther e 
and I don't have to li ke  ever ythi ng and I don't ha
ve to li ke  ever ybody. 
 I'm glad Germany's a 
de mocrac y, I ' m gla d the e ast and west
 have gott en t oget her .  I don't ha ve to l i ke going ba ck.  I fin d  
mysel f ver y unc omfortable there , 
I fi nd the Ger m an language very un
comf ortabl e.  I mean this as  
honest a s I can be wit h you.  I have not for give n a nd 
I cert ainl y don't forge t .  And what I fe el is that  
places like the Holocaust Museum 
must open everywher e and that  
the younger people
 partic ularl y ,  
must go ther e and must see it.  
Be cause wit h the r evisi oni sts, re me
mbe r , those of us who have me t  
Albert Speer, those of us wh o ha
ve been in t he c o nce ntrati on c a mps ar e goi ng to be de a d and the n  
the r evis i oni s m is  reall y goi ng t o star t, how c an y
ou beli eve  al l those dea d people?   And thi s i s not  
far-fetched, this is what
 will happen.  And 
so all of these places are 
imp ortant because there are 
people li ke me who ha ve not for got
t e n.  And it 's  not a matter  of for g
iving, I don't ha
ve to forgi ve,  
you see.  I also don't have to 
forget .  So I ha ve no
t changed my feeli ng a
bout Nazis m  and Al ber t  
Speer is a st ory t hat t ook place an
d i f I can ha ve offer ed some thing 
to the Holocaust Museum in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428

tapes , so mu ch t he better ,  that 's good beca use  I t hi
nk t hat  the se  me mori es have t o be ke pt a nd I thi n k 
that pe ople  have  to be  a bl e to go t her e and hear t he m.  
Q: Can listen to hi
m and decide for t h
emselves in part. 
A: Exactl y. 

Q: And compare it with th
e interview with you. 
A: Ye s.   And listen and decide and read th
e books  and t hank goodne
ss for t he books .  And 
interestingly enough I fi
nd that  these books are no
w starting to co
me  out so ma ny years later, I  
would have  expecte d t he y would ha
ve be en 10 or  20 year s be fore. 
 Of the  ne w Goldha gen( ph)  book 
which talks about the gu
ilt of all of the normal 
Germans, the people who 
used to go and watch  
executions.  But you  know, 
that's interesting, too. 
 Let me not  j ust t ake  off on that  beca use  ther e a r e  
parall els.  Ti mme r man( p h) in his book a nd t he 
tortur e that he unde r w
ent in Argentina has a  
horri fying discus sion wi th his to
rturer, who does his torture as 
a nor mal  job, t h en says t o 
Ti mmer ma n(ph) a f ter t he  tortur e, " Lis ten, my s on 
wants to get into college
, do you know
 some body 
who can get  hi m int o c ollege? "   So if we talk
 about the banality of 
evil, you know, Hannah 
Ar ons( ph) gr eat state me nt , this ha
ppens in a lot of places, there ar
e tortur ers  and was I a ny di ffere nt  
wh en I wa tched the hangman
 and I  went away wit h no feeli ng 
about t he m?   So people  a r e ca pa ble 
of t his.  But nobody has  ever  done
 it on t he scale of t he Ger mans.  
Nobody has ever 
actually built  
gas  cha mbe r s to put pe ople
 i n, had collected hair  and has col lect
ed tee th and ha s coll ected s hoe s. 
And has ha d thi s vir ule nt ant i -Se mi tis m, t hat i s  
bad enough in the worl d 
as it is, but has done 
somet hing li ke tha t  that i s inc onc eiva ble.  So I d
on't have to forgiv
e them.  I also don't have to like 
them.

Q: I hear you talki ng, it 's al most li ke a viscer al
 t hing insi de of you, it 's not nec ess aril y some thi ng 
you've,  I  mean obvi ousl y you've 
t hought about it , but i t 's, you're 
tal king about a visceral r eacti o n  
for i nstance, when yo
u're in Germany.  
A: Absolutely it's vis
ceral, I mean, the intellec
tual, let me give you an
 intellectual thing. 
Intellectually I wo uld say, 
well  ye s, you know, a ft e
r all it is that time, th
ere is a new generation, 
whi ch ther e is and t here wer e good peopl e and t h er
e were  ba d pe ople  and it 's
 done and gone and I 
can't do t his.  Of course i t 's visceral
.  It 's visc eral also bec aus e  I, I 
see t he stirrings in ot her ar eas.  I  
see the stirrings out in, wi
th the Michigan Militia, 
I see the stirring
s with the anti-Se
mitism that's 
come up.  I see the stirri
ngs with a presiden
tial candidate who is
 anti-Semitic, whet
her you li ke it or 
not , he ca n s ay he 's not a nd he has Je wis h pe opl e on hi s sta ff, he 's anti- Se miti c.  I f you see the se  
stirrings as a Jew, you al ways ar e aware of it .  You'
re al ways careful , that th
is is something that can 
affect you, this is something that can kill you. 
 It has happened.  And so
 my only reaction can be 
visceral.  Because we have t he 
antennas out, as the 
Blacks, the African-Am
er icans have their  
antennas out to everything 
that's done, whether it's
 getting, can't get a taxi 
in New York cause they 
pass  you by, to t he a nti- Blac k stat
ements t hat are made.  You always
 ha ve your a nte nna out a s a n  
Afric an- American.  Wel l  you a l ways  have your a nte
nna out a s a Je w.  And so my r ea ction t o an  
Albert Speer or my reaction to Germ
any is totally visceral.  And I'd be lying if I said that well I, you 
know I have to be i ntelle c t ual about 
it now, I can't.  But as I said to
 some one, I was i nter vi ewe d on a 
travel show once, I had done a trav
el  book and I 've done a lot  of tr
a vel fil ms a nd s o mebody s aid t o  
me , " What 's  your fa vori t e  countr y? "   
And I said, "Italy, I love to go to Italy, I 
had an office i n Ital y 
for fi ve ye ar s."  And he said, " A nd
 which countries don't 
you li ke? "  I  sa id, " W
ell I don't think it's 
up to me to t ell you on this progra m whi ch c ount r ies 
I don't li ke."  And I never di d on t he progra m,  

but the point  is, ha ving worke d in 60 c ountries , I ca
n like 59, I don't ha ve to l i ke all 60 countrie s an d

that may be very unintell
ectual, it may be very visceral, that's
 how I feel  and I 
think I've got to 
remember that and I 
wa nt  the Hol oc a u st Mu seu ms  
to make people reme mber
 what these 
people did, 
even i f they'r e all  dead, 
t h at it can happen again. 
Q: Are you glad you i nter vie we d Al be rt Spee r?  
A: Oh, absolutely.  Woul
dn't ha ve missed it for t he worl d, even
 though I turned it down the fir s t 
ti me , I me an, oh of cours e, 
I ' m, it  was  another part  of the  e xpe r i
ence you have as a 
fi l m ma ker , i t 's  
anot her  part  of the e xperi ence  you ha ve a s a  docume
ntar y fil m  make r.  It 's 
the kind of thing wh ere 
people say, "Oh you've led a very
 exciting l i fe."  I say, " Wel l it 's
 not over yet, 
you know."  And 
we 're going to China and Ja
pan next  year  on a  job.  But  yes, it 's
, I'm glad I met Albert Speer.  I'm 
glad that I have worked in countr
ies where there have been
 dictators, not quite 
as bad as Hitler, but 
where I have been able to see first hand what we
nt on.  Whether I got a
nyt hing mor e  out of my  
visceral feeli ng si nce Albert Speer?  Not r eally, but 
that was a  part of the e xperi enc e and I a m ver y  
glad that I  went over t her e. 
Q: Do you think that he 
had sat across from the table very ofte
n wi th Je ws  a nd ans were d  questi ons?  
A: Possi bly some r eport ers, I  don'
t kno w.  He  k ne w I wa s J e wi sh , 
cert ai nly.  I me an if he didn't  
know, so mewhere al ong the line I ' m sure I tol d hi m 
about my Bar Mitzvah, yo
u know.  But I have a 
wa y of letti ng, but  he  kne w a nd he
 k n e w Al ma wa s Je wi sh , s o he had  
in essence a Jewish client and 
a Je wi sh pr oduc er.  The  r est of t h
e crew were all Ameri can
 a nd  Ger ma n  an d Au stri
an.  But ye
s, I, I, 
I think, I think that he had at some point, I don't 
think at this point it made
 any di ffere nce to hi m.  
You know, we  di d not  c o me on as  
J ews i f ther e wer e other  r eport ers  who did intervi e w hi m, but a t  

the sa me  ti me , d eep i n my gu t w a

Q: Did you ever feel
 any responsibility in term
s of representing 
Jews when you we
re sitting there 
aski ng questi ons?  
A: No, I don't think I represented 
Judais m, you know, I , it 's a goo

I don't think I 
did a nd I don't t hink it was ther e, 
you know, you'r e, I would s ay that

say, yeah it's kind of interestin
g that a Je wish pr oducer

 dead i f he 'd won, I ,
 we go back t o t hat

me over i n t he fir st pl ace.  But 
I never represe nt, I ca n't r epr e sent Judais m, J udai s m is  diver se , as  
diver se as , a s any of the religi ons , s o and I ' m sure
 there ar e Jews, cause I r ead there ar e Jews who  
have forgiven at this point, say 
we must move on.  An

way of handling it  or 
not , t hat 's fi ne.  M y wa y of ha ndli ng is  that we neve r for get . 

Q: Di d you l i ke anythi ng about Al bert  Spe er?  

A: Did I li ke anyt hi ng a bout Al bert 
Speer?  I, that 's a wonderful qu
estion in that I can't think of 
anyt hing I  li ked as  a  ver y posit i ve  thing, but  I c a n 't
 thi nk of a nyt hing I  di s liked.  He  was, as  I say ,  
comfortabl e wit h me, at least out war dly.  He wa
s a ge ntle ma n.  He wa s a 
ver y gra ci ous host.  I 
me an we wa nted for not h i ng whil e we  were t here .  He
 di d take us thr ough t he town t o the pla ces h e

hing, he was one of t he  
easiest interviews in the sense of
 a day to day r elations hip over a 
period of 10 days.  Wh at did I  
like?   I  ca n't  thi nk of anythi ng tha t I  woul d sa y 
I really, you know I really 
liked.  No one's ever  
aske d me  t ha t  questi on. 

Q: Do you think you lea r ne
d a nyt hi ng from hi m?   I me a n, 10 days 
is a l ong ti me , you oft en go a way 
fr om an interview 
with something. 
A: What  I t h ink I le arne d is t hat a gre at ma ny pe ople
 i n my ge nerati on wer e 
not at  all  sorry for  what 
happened.  The reaction that these peopl e had.  I 
mea n I was  fairl y aware  of it be fore then, ha ving 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428

worke d i n Ger many s eve ral ti mes  a nd ha ving lived 
in Germany after the war,
 that t he pe ople  of my 
generati on wer e not at  all sorry t h at it happene
d, wer e not at all guilt y about what happe ned.  
Maintained and retained ma ny of
 their feelings, probably anti-S
e miti c a n d so on, 
about the Jews, 
about Ger m any.  I learned also first hand, t hat th
e younger generat i on, for 
the most part see m to  
reject t hat .  They may not 
wa nt t o he ar a bout it , but 
they seem to reject it.  
The fact that the word got 
around that  we were quote fri ends of Al bert Spe e
r and t hey'd walk out, me
ant t hat t hat t here was 
their visceral  react ion t o 
somebody who was th
er e as a quote friend of a N

have, I ma y not li ke list e ning to t heir  Ger ma n be

e traveli ng.  I get  the gut fee
ling, over  and ove
r again when I 
go a place li ke the Al gove(ph) or I go to Spain and 
I see groups of Ger mans tr
aveli ng, of my age, I  
get t he i mmediate  feel ing a nd I mus t
 admit this, that while the Jews
 lie in their graves, there's a 
Jewish term for that, they are out 
enjoying themselves.  I 
still have that fe eling 
and I resent it.  Not 
my fe eling, I  rese nt
 thei r enjoying i t. 
Q: What 's  t h e Jewi sh ter m?  
A: Likte ndr e d(ph), lie s in, lies in, in
 hell.  While the Jews
 li kt endr ed( ph) a nd I, t hat 's t he feeli ng I  
get, i t 's t he feeling I have wherever
 I go.  I must t ell you, 
in terms of my emotiona
l fe eling, if I go t o  
Gre ece a nd t here ar e groups of Ger m an tourists c o
me in to a resta urant , my stoma ch knot s.  No w 
that 's, you t a lk a bout vi sc eral, I have  no i ntell ectua
l feeli ng about it  any mo
re, I should actually pay 
no attention to it.  So I am in that sense very 
de e ply a Je w a nd ver y dee ply invol ved with what  

happened in the Holocaust and ver y 
de eply i nvolve d wit h what the Nazi 's di d and don't e ver want to  
see it happen again to 
anyone.  But I still, if I, I have a job 
coming up where I ma y 
have to go bac k

to Ger ma ny and I would like, fra nkl y to have that
 country dr opped from t he  
group that  we 're goi ng 
to and it won't be and I will
 be a good professional 
film maker again and I will go.  It has nothing to 
do wit h boosting Ger ma ny or a nyt hi ng, it just happ
ens to be a busi nes s  thing.  But  I ha ve t hat  
fe eling and I  make 
no excuses for i t. 
Q: It's a powerful feeling. 
A: Well it's, it come
s out as you see. 
Q: I me an it 's not a feel i ng that
 was give n parti c ularly by your fa m
ily, it really came out of your 
experience as a young man. 

A: Yea h, I t hink it comes dee per t h an experie nc e
 as a young man, I thi nk it come s  fro m I a m  
convinced that ther e is an et hnic 
de pth in pe opl e.  I 'll give you an
 exampl e.  When I hear Middle  
East ern music and t his includes
 Ar abic , Israel i, any Mi ddl e Ea
st ern music or Rus sian music ,  
something deep within 
me comes to life .  
Q: Good? 
A: Good.  Good fe eling.  I me an
 I ha ppe n to be one who ca n't  
under sta nd why the Ara bs and the  
Je ws fight.   The r e is a ve ry dee p, Mi ddle Ea ster n, 
ethni c level t here so that I  think, my wife Cheryl  
has the same fe eling, I'm not the only
 one.  Or she'll look at me 
a nd all of a sudde n I stiffen wit h 
pleasure because t he music get s to
 me .  No w t hat did n 't c o me fro m 
my bac kgr ound a s a  child and i t  
didn't c o me from what my par ents 
t aught me beca use e xce pt for my
 Bar Mitzva h, I r e ally was not a  
very good J ew.  But I a m a ver y
 good Jew as a Jew because that 's
 how I fe el.  So there i s an 
insti nctive J udai s m t here , don't  as k me to e xplai n i t . 
Q: Oka y.  I actuall y ha ven't a ske d you anyt hing a bout this and I think ther e 's pr oba bly s o me thi ngs  

you can say about it.  Wh at 
sense did you get of
 Speer's relationsh
ip with Hitler? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
36 
 
A: Very cl ose, very cl ose.  
All  the phot ogr aphs, all 
t he  photographs  that  he  ha s, al l of the  
me mora bilia , his home movie s.  I had a fee ling that
 Speer , although I notice Gidda Sera ny(ph) says 
at the begi nning was  not part of th
e  inner circle , I  got  a feeli ng that 
he  was  very cl ose .  And I  have  a  
feeling t hat he respected 
the man as t he leader of 
his countr y a nd I  believe he al ways  di d a nd I don't  
belie ve he  ever c hange d his mi nd
, t hrough t he en
d of t he war. 
Q: Even though in 
your  tape s you do tal k a bout  that  poin
t where Al ber t  Speer  get s  sick a nd he  
doesn't see Hitler for awhile
 and as he explains it, 
he's pulled out of 
his sphere of influence and then 
when he s e e s  hi m a gai n, so
mething has changed.  So even after 
that c hange , you don't t hink that he  
fundamentally change d?  
A: No , I don't think he fundamenta
lly changed.  I think this wa s 
the, this was the dynamics and I 
can't speak t oo you know, aut henti ca
lly, but I t hi nk it 's the dyna mics
 of what ha ppene d.  Re me mb er 
this whole inner group were
 always close to Hitler.  You move 
out for awhile like
 in any corporate 
group and then you mo ve in and you'
ve got to wo rk your wa y back 
in again.  I th
ink he always 
respe cte d Hi tler.  I don't know how he  fel t  at the end of t he war, I 
don't know how he fe lt before he  
died but my fe eling wa
s t hat he was cl ose. 
Q: He says in the interview that  
you did wit h hi m that he feels  e m
bar r ass e d, I  thi nk, he  mi ght  ha ve  
eve n sai d s h a me a nd he i s ver y halti ng whe n he 
s ays t his , at declari ng hi
s admirati on for somebody 
who became such 
a monster.  So what's goin
g on there, he's using the ri
ght terms for Hitler, he's  
calling him a monster, but
 he's also saying th
at he really cared de
eply about this man. 
A: See , thi s i s the poi nt, when a n
yone interviews a man like Albert 
Spe er.  Is he s ayi ng this beca use  
this is politically correct? 
 That was a term that wa
s not around then.  Is th
is the answer he expect s 
me to have?  I mean suppose he said to me and this
 is only instinctive about
 his feeli ng a bout Hit l er  
through the t i me .  Suppose he sai d to me, " Oh t h
i s ma n wa s a  mo nster , I hated hi m at t he end, I 'm 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
37 
 
glad he wa s dea d."  Do you t hin
k I c o uld belie ve it  for one mi nute?   Not when he was i n vol ved wit h 
the armame nts almo
st right up until the last 
minute.  Not until he was th
e heir apparent, the heir 
apparent to Hitler if 
Hitler had been killed.  No, I have a f
eeling that we'r e back to his coming up  
wit h the answer s of 20 years in Sp
andau.  That 's a feeling.  But th
e n agai n, I ' m a ve ry prejudice d  
ma n about  that whole  th
ing, so you know, in... 
Q: And you wer e ther e, you spe nt 10 
days wit h hi m, so s o me  of t h
e i n for mati on t hat you'd gat her  
about hi m ar e feel ings and nuances 
a b out  ways he said thi ngs a nd hi
s  body l angua ge, 
that sort of. 
A: Well the  body language was pre tty much t h e sa
me throughout.  Al most
 rigi d, comfortabl e. 
Comforta ble  in his ans w ers.  As I say I think he thought about the m thr o ugh all t hat t i me .  But i n  

ter ms of body la nguage, look, he wa s, the r e was al
ways t he gap bet w een us, let 's fa ce  it, I me an  
reme mb er, alwa ys the busin
ess suit s wit h t he ti es.  I wa s doi ng
 my  job and he wa s answering the 
best he ha d thought about ans w ering through al l 
these years .  I think he  had co me up with t he  
answer s to every one of t he ques
ti ons  that I a ske d hi m and pos sib
ly not what Gi dda Ser any( ph) di d 
caus e s he  re ally went  in dept h, but t h at a ny repo
rt er c o ming t h ere woul d have  as ked hi m.  I found 
no gre at r eve lation i n a nyt hing I  rea d l ater on. 

Q: Di d you under sta nd Hi tler a ny bette r a f
ter you'd done this 
10 day interview?  
A: No.  You know, I, it's , if, no 
I didn't understand Hitle
r any better and I don't
 think that I could 
have gotten that out of this.  Pr
obably is one of the world's grea
t monsters, I put 
with hi m all the 
other people who were with
 him as just as 
monstrous.  It was not only 
Hitler, they had to go along 
with him, they knew what was 
happening.  I not only don't under
stand Hitler any better, I don't 
underst and the vir ulence  of t he ent i r e group 
ar ound hi m, i n cludi ng Goe
bbel s, including Göri ng, 
including VonShurac k(ph), incl udi ng
 all of them.  No , I said befo

Naz i move ment.  Oh, I under sta nd th
en, I know, underst and what it  di
d, I  under stand ever ythi ng for  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428

aft er Wo rld Wa r 1, I understand al l 
of the things that happened.  I 
hear a great many of the thi ngs 
happe ning today.  The populis t th
ing about look what the y di d to you i n the war and l ook what the  
corporations are doing to 
you, this was Hitler's wh
ole schtick and I understa
nd it after the war.  I 
underst and a l so the thi n g of uni for ms and Nur e
mber g and so on.  I c an even understa nd the m 
for ming t he ar my, I can even
 understand the m having
 a war.  Wh at I can't 
underst and i s what  they 
did to 20 mil lion pe opl e, deliberatel y. 
Q: Did Albe rt Spe er eve r  bring up 
some of the delicat e questions hi
msel f in a way t o sort of pre-
e mpt you, pe rhaps bri ngi ng up t he i ss ue of what he
 kne w about the J e ws, wh
at was  ha ppening to the  
Jews and when? 

A: No, as I r ecall, now re
member t his is recal ling.  As I  recal
l what, t he pat t ern was pret ty well set  
in that unless there was a questio
n he never real ly vol unte ere d anyt hi
ng, except to bri
ng me  in to see 
Hitler's drawings and the architect
ural things and the home movi
es, these were volunteered.  In 
ter ms of the answer s to the questi
ons , not really.  Now I ha ve not he
ard the tapes in a while, you'd  
have to hea r  that , I re all y don't 
re me mber.  I re me mber it  bei ng a  patt ern, I ha d my li st and t his is  
pretty  mu ch  wh at we  we nt t o.  

Q: Wit h the things he volunte ere d, 
j u st liste ning t o you j ust s a y 
that right now I ' m wonderi ng, was 
he just tr ying to show you jus t  anot her slightl y 
di fferent angle so that pe
rhaps it being more three 
di mensional  for you?   What
's your t h oughts  on t h at?  
A: Wel l  it 's hard t o sa y.  Again,
 I can't reme mber all the nuances 
of the t i me I was 
there.  He was 
profe ssi ona l.  It 's  the  best  I ca n s ay.

Q: Was t her e a mo ment in the 10 da
ys that Alber t  Speer c aught you 
off guard, said something that 
surprise d you, per ha ps 
e ven di d something?  
A: Not in ter ms , I don't r e me mbe r  a n ythi ng, I ' m s u
re t here must ha ve bee n 
so me t i mes and I 'm sur e  
that some of the  questions, but you asked the 
question, the first thing 
that came t o mi nd wa s 
somet hing that has bee n ma de very 
available at this time and in f
act I saw it not to
o long ago on a, 
on a documentary about t he wa
r , whic h had not hing to do with Albe
rt Speer  or Adol f Hit l er.  And it  
had t o do wi th the proble ms t hat ca me up in ar ma me nts duri ng the e nd of the war.  The Ger ma n s  

were the first to develop jet pl
a nes , or to de vel op fl ya ble j et 
pla nes , which woul d have tot ally  
destroyed the armada's of the allie
s, considering everything was a 
prop plane at the 
time, the fl ying 
fortresses and so on and 
the P38's  and Hitler did not
 trust the jet engine, it
 had no propeller.  And 
therefore, up until the very en
d, he refused to let them us
e it.  At the very end  
he let them use it.  By  
that ti me  though, Speer c oul d not 
develop enough planes t o make 
any di fference.  But there was a  
fa sci nating t hing, it 's like  some body devel opi ng t h e atom
ic bomb be fore us, s o 
of all the things that 
he me nti one d to me , that  stic ks 
in my  mi nd as something that  I 
had not heard of and now as I say, 
has be come part of the hi storia ns , you know, the 
historia ns whole gr oup of
 books and fil ms and s o  
on.  But  that  to me , s urprised me
.  Other t han tha t , in ter ms  of 
t he answer s, reme mber  I sai d my  
fe eling was, through the en
tire ti me that he ha d come up, I c oul d not c o me up wit h a que stion e xce pt  
aski ng wha t  he sai d to hi s wi fe a nd his childr e n, in
 the visi ts t o Spandau, t hat he woul d not have  
thought of before .  A ver y bri ght  man, a ver y 
bri g ht ma n.  Under s o me 
ot her for m of governme nt  
would ha ve  bee n a bril liant e xec uti ve pos sibl y, 
I can't say archit ect be
cause I wa s ne ver ver y  
impressed with his architecture 
as I was not impresse
d with Hitler'
s drawings, bu
t was bright 
enough, wa s  prese nta ble enough, wa
s  articula t e enough.  Cert ai nly s p
oke English quit e well.  Could 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428

have bee n a  really well known, gr
ea t ma n in some other c o untr y.  
But he ne ver rea lly, we ne ve r 
really threw one another.  He ne
ver really t hrew me, I 
ha d my questi ons, I al
ways had to keep my  
dee p fe elings burie d, whi ch I  di d an
d he i n t urn ha d t hought of ever
y s ingle one  of the a n swers.   
Q: Do you t hink that , do you t hink t h
at wha t  you were just
 me ntioni ng, that he 's ver y bri ght , he  
coul d have, he c oul d ha ve just b
een such a shi ning st ar i n anot
her countr y, anothe r governme nt, do 
you t hink t ha t  might be  pa rt of
 whe r e his sa dness c o me s fr om?  

A: Possibly, that's so meth
ing that you know, I ca n't , i f it were 
me, i f I felt t ha t  wa y, yea h, I would, I  
would say so, look at ther e but for 
the grace of God.  Just as I say, i f
 he had won, I 'd be dead.  Or I 'd  
be slave labor, yeah if he'd been, but he wa sn't, he
 was a part of Hitl er 's entoura ge a nd he was ve ry  
mu ch , v e ry mu ch i n  fa v o r w
ith Hitler through most of
 t he ti me .  He was a p a rt
 of the inner circle, he 
was for a long time the second in 
command, if Hitler had 
died he would have gotten the, the, h e  
wo uld have been head of Germany.
  It 's a re markable thi ng for a 
man who at t hat ti me was i n hi s  
30's a nd t he n 40's .  I as ked hi m a bout Spa nda u you
 know, but ba sicall y I got t he fai rly sta ndard  
ans wer s, he, it fa sci nate d me a l so, was  I gues s one 
of the other t hings, sur pri sed I me ntioned t hat he  
had s howe d me t he ori gi nal manusc ri pt.  I f you c oul
d take pie ces of tor n out paper, j us t  take about 
600 piec es of skinny, tor n out pape
r, no mor e  tha n three i nc he s, w
ith a ti ny Ger mani c hand writte n 
on it, then you'll know wh
at t he  ma nus cript  is , t his whol e s t ack 
of pa per s whi ch he  got out , I  gue ss  
got out thr ough Ma rgar ett a(ph) , but that wa s the manu
scri pt of his book.  So
 re me mb er this, he was  
writing that book while he was still in
 Spandau.  The thing that also
 bothers me , I think, if I think 
about it, and you sa y you know, what wer e my real 
feeli ngs  about hi m.  Re
me mber also that the  
book cha nge d in c onte xt  from the  
German to the Americ
an version.   The w
hol e s ecti on on a nti-
Se miti s m was toned down.  The w
hole , a whol e, no, yes , well no
, when you say aft er I di d t h e  
interview, no, they, it wa
s being done  while I was doi ng the int e
rvie w, that book was not out, I onl y 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428  
41 
 
sa w the  book in ma nusc ript, but  
I had not seen the Germ
an version.  But th
e German version and 
the En glish version do no
t match, in several important places
, beca use  for t he Am
erican audience, 
they felt they could not be as 
str ong in some of the areas.  So
 now that  gives you a ki nd of a  
suspicion, both about Al
bert Speer and the 
people wh o controlled the 
public ation of t he book. 
Q: You talk about how he 
sort of gave you what he wa nted to
, he'd thought these answers out and 
yet it seems that in 
a  way, it 's li ke his sel f por
tr ait and that 's  re veali ng t oo, what he doe s want  to sa y  
about hi ms el f, Al bert Spe er and wha t  he doesn't , th
at while you were, you fe el that you weren't able 
to puncture it too much, 
it's still a self portrait. 
A: Of c our se , this is what  he wa nts you to think, this  is what he wa nts you to feel , he cert ainly is n o t  

goi ng to come out a s a sel f pr ocla
imed monster, which by the way I 
don't think he wa s.  You s ee,  
yes he use d slave  labor a nd he ma y or may not  ha
ve bee n anti -Se miti c.  Interesti ngl y e nough, I ' m 
not sure.  He may have been one 
of those, those, apo
litical people in terms of
 his anti-Semitism, I 
don't know.  Cert ainl y he wa s not 
one of the virul e nt ones , cert ainly
 he was  not a Goebbels.  On t he  
other  ha nd, he wa s a pa rt of t he 
hie r archy a nd you know, t h e res ponsi
bility is there,
 it's like the  
responsibility is there.  Wh en yo
u have a doctor and th
e nurse is hostile to 
you, the doctor i s  
responsible .  Wel l  it 's t he  sa me th
i ng here , he 's re s ponsibl e.  I me an 
he was  a top ma n i n this group. 
So yes , he wa nte d you to feel, as  anyone do
es, a certai n way.  He wa
nts t o pr esent and to 
communica t e to you how he , Albert  Speer feel s abou
t it  and come out  looki ng 
prett y, at least fairl y  
good, not as a mo nst e r.  Re me mber 
also, he wa s shrewd enough and 
he wa s smart enough not to get 
the deat h pe nalty.  And he ha d t o ma
intain that too, he could not be 
one of the monsters that was put  
to deat h.

Q: You t alk about bur ying your ow
n feelings.  Was there 
a time after the interv
iew, in the day or  
two a fter , le aving Ger ma ny, or e ve n a mont h or t wo 
l ater , when at s o me point t he fee l i ngs sur f ace  
and wha t  wa s that li ke  or , or  di d 
you basicall y j ust  erase  it some how?  
A: No, I never erased it and t he f
eeli ng did sur face and aft er leavi ng,
 as with any reporter or film 
ma ker, I wo uld like to have had the 10 days again because there were
 places I think I wa s too kind. 
There were places I felt and still f
eel that my follow 
up was not strong 
enough.  At th
e same time, 
it 's now 20-20 hi ndsight, I now know
 a lot  more.  In fact i f  I weret o see hi m again, 
I don't wa nt to 
see him,  he's  dead, but if I were
 to see him again, I wo uld have a 
lot more questions and a lot of 
them would come fr om r esear ch t h
at's been done by people like Gi
dda Se rany( ph).  I didn't have it  
at that  ti me .   R e me mb er , h e  h a d 
just come  out of Spandau a few 
years befor e or a year or t w o 

be for e.  Tha t 's a not her t hing that we 'v e got to 
kee p in mi nd, he c a me 
out of pr ison, he wa s a  
prisoner, he came out, he's now w
ith the fa mily, he's in Heidel berg(p
h) where half of the town hates  
hi m and the  other hal f of the town
 puts the red carpet down.  He 's
 with his family, he'd not see n  
Margaretta(ph) for, more than on
ce a  mont h for  20 ye ars .  He 'd no
t se en t hese ki ds who gre w u p  
wit hout hi m,  some of whom as I sa y I was sure wa s 
l e ft , were l e ft  o f ce nt er
.  And so, comi ng out of  
prison as any prisoner, as
ide from the horrendous th
i ngs  that wer e done by 
th e Na zi r e gi me,  c o min g  
out as any prisoner, he
 had a lot to get used
 to.  And even gettin
g used to sitting do
wn at a table with 
a gr oup of fi l m makers  and his wi fe
 a n d his chil dre n a nd ha ving a dinn
er .  Al ways at t he head of the 
table , ver y st iff.  Ver y, ve ry st i ff. 

Q: De fi nitely, I think you've just 
used a fe w wo rds, but that imag
e comes across very clearly, this 
ma n, who was rigi d and hi
s whole body was c ontr olled.  You a r
e showing, you're pu
lling out some 
pictur es . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0428

A: I, yes, I am pulling out the pictures, look at a
ny of these.  Look at me
, pointing my fi nger and  
look at hi m ans weri ng t h e que stions . 
 Here you ha ve an eve n better one,
 t hi s is a pic t ure  of me  with  
Albert Speer  and Al ma  Trynor( p
h) on the lawn.  I should call 
it my Gre ek peri od, I ha d long 
side bur ns  and a  bl ack mu
stache, I ha d blac k ha
ir  then you noti c e. 
Q: Descri be  hi m ____. 
A: And i f I  descr i be Al bert Sp
eer , i f  you tal k about body l a nguag
e, t he hand, he 's si tting r athe r  
stiffly in the chair, lean
ing a little to the right, whic
h is very typical, hands cl
asped, legs crossed, as  
my l e gs we r e  cros sed.  The di ffer
ence in the t w o of us i s that I 
have the  whole type A finger up,  
pointing a fi nger and asking 
a question and he, wi
th almost a little
 bit of suspicio
n on the questio n 
and that  was  ver y typical .  The se 
pic t ures are not  at all unus ual, 
this was very typical about the 
whole , well we di dn't int ervie w over 10 da ys , we  
intervie wed I think six or seven da ys of t he 10  
days, we ha d to get to know hi m, we had to get 
to know the communit y, we 
had to tal k  about what 
we were goi ng t o tal k a b out wit hou

Germany up fr om the ruins of mo st of the bomb
ing a nd a ctually tur ni ng out t he ta nks and t he  
planes.  He wa s a very, ve
ry effective bureaucrat. 
Q: He clearl y wa s ver y, very bright, the work he
 did and t he n eve n what  he learne d and st udi ed 
when he wa s  in prison.  We re you 
ever inti midate d by hi m i n that se ns
e, in the intellectual sense of 
joust i ng a bout t he t r ut h wit h a  ma n li ke t hat?  
A: No, I  was  never i nti mi date d, but  
I think I knew all the ti
me I  spoke to hi m t h
at I  was goi ng t o ge t  
the ans wers  that he ha d well pr epar ed.  I was never inti mi date d bec ause basi call y you have t o  

remember that deep, deep
 down, there was the ange
r and the gut feeling that
 he still was Hitler's 
number t wo ma n, t hat it wa s 
an experience and it
 was an experience
.  I ne ver, ne ver forgot t he fa ct  
that I was a Jew speaking 
to Hitler's number two ma
n on a very civilized ki
nd of a lawn, you know, 
goi ng i n to l unc h or dinner in a fe w mi nute s.  It 's  a ve
ry weird, surrealist fe elin
g.  But no, I never felt 
intimidation.  Nor wa
s he  the kind of ma n who int i mi date d.  
Which i s a not her poi nt .  A l ot of it ha d 
to do with hi m too.  He wa s not ar
r o gant .  We think of s o me , partic
ul arly when we see the movi es 
wit h t he Nazi ar m bands and you th
i n k of the arrogance and the arr
oga nce  of t he Ge sta po and s o on, 
this was not the ki nd of ma n he wa
s and he may not have e ve n bee n 
that during the wa r, but I don't  
know. 

Q: Just a mome nt ag
o we  were tal king about the e motion fi nall
y coming out, I don't know i f it did at  
one  point  a n d we  got sidetracked, I  want 
t o j ust  c o me  back to t hat questi on. 
A: About his  e moti on?  

Q: No, your emotion finally comi ng
 out at one poin
t or did it just? 
A: No, never.  I wa s very careful neve
r to let that emotio
n out , I  could not. 
Q: No, a ft er war ds , a fter war ds .

A: Aft e r war ds sure , it  c a me out t he  mome nt I  l e ft . 
 It ca me  out  as  I dis cuss ed it wit h ot her  fil m  
ma ker s, whe n I dis c us se d 
how you handle a t hi ng li ke thi s, 
wa s it ha ndl ed pr operly, how do you 
handle a thing like this wh
ere i f you s et up as we said a t  the 
very begi nni ng, t he str uct ure of a Je w  
fr om the Bronx going to see Hitle
r's number two man.  
And nobody can ever answer it, about the 
only thing everyone agrees
 with is that you have
 to kee p your a nger  de e p down, that  you re ally 
can't, and as he sa id, I, I ,
 I obviousl y must have been ver y fun
ny at  some  point bec aus e  if he said I  
hide ever ything I fe el be hind a se nse  of hu mor , he
 knows or kne w what I  felt
.  I mea n  let 's not ki d  
one a not her ,  he kne w I wa s Je wish, 
he kne w what I felt , he kne w what
 I must have felt.  So if he 
said a thing like that , just as I 
sai d, he  hid eve r yt hi ng he  feel s behi
nd 20 ye a rs in Spa nda u.  We  both 
wer e wearing t he gloves. 
Q: And the ma sk. 

A: And t he ma sk, yeah
.  Which in a sense is not the best  wa
y to get an interview, it's easier to 
interview a doctor who's a neurosur
ge on, a sk hi m about brai n s urger y. 
Q: That's what I wanted to ask,
 I don't know if there'
s some thing we haven't 
touched on that we  
should sa y a bout t he i nte
rview, about the tapes. 
A: The ta pes , there 's not hing more 
I c an s ay about the i nter vie w or t h
e ta pe s, I would li ke  to fi nd t he  
other  t wo t apes , re me mbering t ha t  the y als o 
wer e ac compani ed by fil m and s o it woul d be  
interesting to see at this point 
if one of the questi ons you a ske d 
about ca me off on fil m .  Wa s ther e  
any poi nt where he s howe d any of thi s  other re act
i on, e moti on or whate ver 
it ma y be , di scomfort.  I  
would ha ve to se e the uncut  fil m 
because even t he cut fil m would on
ly have the cor rect answer s. 
But i n seei ng the uncut fil m y
ou would know bec ause we went on 
I don't know how many rolls or  
how ma ny hours  we had.  In or der 
t o  do 10, 10 mi nute s 
fil ms, plus a fil m on the architect ure i n a 
totalitarian regime, which was 10 mi nut
es, you're talking 100 
minutes of fi nished f
ilm.  I don't recall

what we s hot, we must have had 
a tr uckl oa d of fil m when we we nt bac k  beca use we  kept r olli ng  
through all these things.  
Today with vide ota pe, it
 wo uld be cheaper, but... 
Q: Yeah ____ didn't 
you have t o st op for t he  airpla nes?  
A: Yes, well  ever y ti me, ever y, one day when we wer e out t here, we
 surveyed it for t he first couple  
of da ys, it was per fe ct, the birds wer e chirpi ng a n
d the first day we were 
going to fil m, t here was a  
stor m over Frankfort , we  didn't  kn
ow this, all we knew is
 a jet  came over .  Th
en anot her jet  came  
over , t he n a n other  a nd you know that, that 's  it for t a
pe and I  ke pt st opping t h
e ta pe  and s t opping t h e  
fil m and he  said, " O h,"  he s aid, " w henever  the r e '
s a storm in Frankfort, 
the pla nes circle ove r  
Hei del berg( ph) .  So for a bout two hours we had noth
i ng but je ts circli ng over
 He idel ber g(ph).  For a  
film maker this is death, 
this is terrible.  Overall 
it's, look, it's been with 
me this many years, I still 
read about him, I s
till can't get enough about
 him.   If I see him on tele
vision on some  film about 
Wo rld Wa r 2, I still sit up and take 
notice.  Having lived in Berlin 
right after the wa
r, I know the 
VonSay(ph) house , I wa s  ve r y invol ved wit h that wh
ole area.  As 
a Jew in Ger many, t here were, 
there were l ots of pr obl e ms.  In fac t , to show 
how it wor ks ,  whe n Cher yl fir st ca me  over and to  
show my anger, we were livin
g in M ax Schme lli ng's(ph) , Ma x 
Schmel ling(ph) was a boxer, was a  
hea vywei ght  boxer, who was t he Ger ma n c h
a mp, who wa s be aten 
by J oe Louis and in  
________________ in 
Berlin and a woman came t o
 the door.  We had just
 received a package fr om 
the States t o  supple me nt  our GI rati ons , whic h we
r e ple nti ful anyhow.  An
d there were lots of 
people there, there were l ots of di spl a ces per sons.
  There wer e the camps, 
t he DP camp s and we di d  
know s o me DP's and we did go to 
the camps and we were very involved with them.  And in radio, I 
wa s invol ve d wi th t he docume ntarie s.  And t here wa
s a knock on t he door a
nd a woma n ca me to t he  
door a nd Cheryl c a me t o the door a
nd the woma n s aid, "I 'm hungry, is
 t her e somet hing I can have to 
eat? "  And I said, " No."  
And Che r yl said, " You c an't do t hat t o
 some body wh o is 
hungr y."  And s he

we nt in and she got a can of salm
on a nd she ga ve i t  to t he wo man. 
 And we had our first  big ma rrie d  
fi ght , be caus e I was so a n gry that the y  had st arve d 
people , that t hey had put t he m in gas c ha mbers , I 
mean I don't have to go through 
the whole litany, they ha
d done all these things and she said you 
can't t urn a woman who is 
hungry a w ay.  So obvi ousl y t he n a nd 
obviousl y eve n t o 
this day, my  gut 
fe eling is , I find it di ff
ic ul t to go ba ck.  I fi nd it di
fficult to hear Germ
an spoken.  I find
 it difficult to 
me et s o meone of my ge nerati on who was i n Ge r ma ny in
 1940, '41, '42.  Ca n't 
help it.  So in that  
sense I 've come away wi th a ver y, an even str o
nger e moti onal  feeli ng a nd my spe aki ng to Albert  
Speer is just one of those little bricks in that whol
e thing of building how I f
eel today and I would do  
it again, as I said to you before. 

Q: Okay. 

A:  Ok ay.  All right.
