A: No, no, no.  We was in
 contact with the 
-- our neighbors.  They were
 Gentiles, and we lived in 
very har mony condit i on, whate ver. 
 No, c onditi on is not enough a s p
eci al word.  We li ved i n very  
good terms with our neighbor
s, with our Gentile neighb
ors.  They tried -- so
me, they try very much 
to help.  Some like 
e ver ythi ng els e, i t was  ver y bad ones 
who try t o cooper ate wit h t he Ger mans. 
Q: As a boy, di d you know of anti -Se miti s m?  
A: Pola nd was a ver y extraor dinar y c ountry, what
 people all over the worl d could not underst and 
about Pola nd.  Pola nd was a good countr y.  The 
governme nt we nt by the na me , by t h e Pre side nt,  
when was - -  the na me  was Pils uds ki

inar y presi de nt for  the pe opl e. 
The people, they -- I cannot say in general the peop
le was bad peopl e.  We got good and bad ones i n  
any nation.  Ho wever, Po
land went t h rough a catac
lys m, t he y always  got t he wa rs bec a use  the y was  
in the middl e bet we en Russia  and 
Ge r ma ny and Austria , all the  bor ders .  And the y al ways, e ver y 20 

years , e ver y 40 years , a l wa ys a r evoluti on or war.
  Pola nd never got a cha nce t o st raight en out  
the mse l f a nd to be  ori gi n al, r eall y i ndepe nde nt. 

Q: But be for e the war , yo

hard.  We ne ver looke d s o methi ng 
for  nothi ng.  We was ver y inde pe
nde nt.  My father give a way a  
lot of charity to Jewish 
organizations and Gentile or
ganizations, alike.  And 
about myself, I went to  
Yeshi va.  This means Ort hodox sc
hool.  Later  whe n I  got  older, 
I we nt t o a  Gent ile sc hool.  I  
graduate  fr om high school.  After  I graduate , my 
pare nts and mysel f , t h ey 
try to send me to law 
school which I attend
ed two years.  After sch
ool, I was sitting in courthous

country, our fa milies.  For a while, 
I s ave d my par ents , my brothers 
a nd sist ers, be fore t he war they 
left to Fr anc e.  And I  was mysel f
 home, try t o work older brot her ,
 with two ol der brothe rs, with  

Gustav and Bar uch.  Lat e

This was a street by the name lik

with a Gentile person, 
wit h our nei ghbor 's son, and all of
 a  s udden, c a me  about approxi matel

on is  about  2  
or 4,000 air planes in the  air.  Ver y l ow a nd 
below was ma ybe 10,
000 motorcycles on the bottom.  
And the airplanes, they tried to 
protect those motorcycles if mayb
e the opponents, 
they will fi ght 
bac k i mme diately.  Not hing ha ppe ned.  The y we nt
 thr ough.  In three  days
 or four da ys, t he y  
occ upie d all  Pola nd.  Later the y -- Pol and was 
divi ded.  The Ger ma ns , they divi ded Pola nd i n 
ghett os , in c a mps , and they ma ke LÃ³
dz was t he bigge st ghett o  in th
e United St ates.  
Excuse me , in 
Pol a nd.  Par don me , in Pol a nd.  Lat e r they ope n
 up ghe ttos i n ever y city, approxi mat ely in every  
city.  A ghet to, to i n for m  you better , i s like thi s:  Th
e y sel ect six, s eve n str eet
s, big str e ets, a nd they 
close  up on bot h side s.  And the y
 concentrate all those 
pe ople i n t his particul ar st re et, i n t hos e 
streets.  And they have to liv
e inside, sl eep, a nd do work, under n
o uris he d.  Th e min i mu m, ver y  
mi nimu m amount fo od.  And everyt
hing under terror.  
M os tly they got  bottl es would se nd an d 
wat er.  Bott l es, regul ar bottles.  I f he don't li ke you
 face or he don't li ke you, 
he just bend you i n hal f 
with a bottle of water or they se
nd.  You be dead on th
e spot.  Maybe they ta
ke you out and they 
throw you a wa y, we don't know whe r
e the y put t hos e pe opl e.  This was t he most bar b arian ti me  in 
3,000 years .  Neve r wa s s o methi n
g, what I saw for my  own eyes. 
Q: What ha ppe ne d a fter  the mot orc ycles a nd t he ai
rpla nes , what happene d to you ne xt?   Did you 
hide?  

A: The next  step was t he  Ger ma ns  
in a month later, mayb
e three weeks later to
 recognize every Je w 
to be a Je w, and t o terr or
 -- to terrorize the Jewish people.  So 
t hey put i n a Star of Davi d, a yell ow  
Star of Davi d, and this was the re
cognition, thi s you a Jew.  Because
 I was a different Jew mysel f. 
A di ffere nt Je w mea ns some Je wi sh people , the y  ga
ve up.  I  did not .  I don
't put on the Star o f  
Da vid, and I was mixe d in wit h Ge nt iles.  And th
ey could not  recognize me or I am a Jew or a  
Gentile.   

Q: Was n 't  t h at ris ky?  

A: This  is de ad on the s p ot, or
 I don't  care.  I f I  di e , I  die  
or I  di e as  a  Je w wi th pride .  
Q: How did you know wh
ich Gentiles 
to trust?

A: Good question.  There 
was a big station and a big,
 tremendous street to th
e station.  Hitler came 
and hol d a s peec h.  Approxi ma tely, i t
 wa s 10 or 15,000 people in thi s
 area, concentrate, listen to  
speech. 
Q: Do you re me mber  whe n t his was?  

A: This was later -- this wa s in December.  It 
wa s cold.  This is the 
reason I remember it was 
December.  In Poland December 
is  very cold, s now, rai n, mis era
ble da ys.  I was s t andi ng with 
Ger ma ns shoulder wit h s h oul der.  He brought his gr
oup, the SA, SS, a nd I wa s 
standing there.  They 
don't know I a m a Je w.
  Nobody c oul d rec ogni ze me beca us
e I was dre ssed an
d combed li ke a 
Ger ma n .  And I  know t he s t yle  bec ause  I wa s born 
in this area.  I know 
how the Ge rmans, they 
dres s.  How they do it .  And I re
me mber one phrase -- I speak Germ
a n mys elf.  Shoul d I  tell you th e  
phra se?  

Q: I f you tr a nslate  it . 

A: I will translate you.  Ven de lieb er Gott (ph).  If God help us in 
Poland, he will help
 us in France. 
This means he said in Ge
rman, "God help us to o
ccupy Poland.  The 
next will be France."  In his 
speech, thi s phrase.  And I was st
andi ng a r m a nd s houlder  
and shoulder i n t he mi
ddle .  Nobody.  As  
a matt er of fact, some Ger mans, 
they just mumbling against those 
speeches.  Those 
speec h, what he  
wa s holding.  They cannot talk.  If he talk right aw
a y, he be in ja il for 15 ye ar s or they s hoot hi m on 
the spot , whatever  it is.  
Or t his i s a Ge ntle , or Je w,  what ever
 it is.  This was 
the ir policy, nobody  
can be  a gainst me  or  a gai nst our
 s yste m or  against our  pr ogr a m. 
Q: What did it feel  like 
be ing in thi s cr owd?  
A: The fe eling is just like they 
take somebody to the electric ch
air in a civilized country, and ten 
mi nute s be fore he get el ectroc ute d they ask hi m, 
" What is your wi sh? "   One guy sai d, "I 'd like t o 
hear a symp hony."  Anot her guy, he s a
id, "I 'd like to have a bet ter me al
," or whate ver it is.  What his  
desire is.  My desire is to see 
how the Ger mans get back 
what  they deserve, wh
at the y  did t o that  
civilized people all over the world. 
 Anyhow, I tried to pr
otect my one brother an
d his famil
y.  I lost 
ever ybody, t hey went  to Fr
ance and l ater I got no cont act wit h th
em.  I tried to he
l p out because my  
brot her , he wa s six fee t  and t wo inc hes tall , and 
he got four  kids .  And in
clude d my parent s, my

fat her a nd my mother, tr y put t he m i n a se parat e 
spot .  And I tried to hidden the m ma ybe for ni ne  
months after I put them in a spot
, in a room, of course
.  And I paid a Gen
tile money not to, yo u 
know.  And I brought the m food an
d whatever they need the most.  
And a f t er this I got no c hoi ce no 
more.  So I did before I l o st th
e m, ther e wa s bi g house , a bi g home wit h a bi g yar d you c oul d take in 
about 2,000 people .  So they put 
in 2,0 00  Jewish fa mi lies, singles
, what ever  it i s, Je wis h pe ople ,  
included my father .  Got caught and 
t hey got  the m i nsi de.  M y br other got  insi de.  So I  we nt -- let 's  
see, thi s i s t he area over  her e
 where  the y conce ntrate d 2,000.  
And t he  neighbor wa ll, s o I  wor k  
about ni ght  ti me  bet w ee n one a nd t hree o'c l oc k 
in the morning,
 nobody knows.  And I took out 
bricks -- you know, Europe houses, 
they build from bricks.  So I to
ok out  t he br icks, br ick by brick, 
until  I ma ke  a bi g hole .  And I  we nt
 inside and I put 
on Yuder, the St
ar of Da vid.  Beca use  wi thout  a 
star, I could not go in.  Not in, beca us e not thr ough
 the front door well , eve r yb
ody can go in and out . 
So I ma ke  a hole , a nd I wa s inside
.  And you c an i magi ne for  your ow
n eyes what 's go
i ng on inside  
wit h those peopl e.  People 
automatically lost 
thei r mind.  They l ost thei
r faith in life .  They got 
nothing for one minute 
in mind, they will survive or
 they can live, or they le
t them live.  So I took  
my fat her  be caus e e ver y dea d pers on
 who dies inside, they took them
 out  i n li ke a  pus hcart .  So I  
took my fat h er and make belie ve he 's dea d on t he 
pus hcar t, a n d I got hi m out 
from t he hous e.  And I  
locate him in a spot; later 
I ca me to my br other, and I tri ed t o 
get hi m out.  And my
 brot her, he  was  
a very str ong person.  And I said, " C ome on, I ta ke  you 
out.  I got a spot , I take you out ."  He sai d, "I 
gave up.  I gave up."  And t her
e was not  too much
 time to convin
ce him,  "What are you doing?" 
And I got my father out , and hi m, 
he don't want to go out
.  And he was a big s moker, s moki ng.  He  
said, "The only thing what
 you can do for  me , bri
ng me  a cigarette .  Bri n g me a ci gar ette, ple ase . 
You s ave my li fe, bri ng me a ciga
rette."  I said, "Come on out.  I 
gi ve you ten pac ka g es cigarette . 
Come  on out ."  I try agai n and agai n and a gai n.  I 
coul d not convi nce hi m.  
And I got out my father, 
and I got out his wi fe wi th the ki ds .  And he , no
 way; I c oul d not c onvince hi m.  And people s o  
when I took out all those, my fath
er a nd my sist er -in-la w 
with the kids, so they tried to do the sa me 
thing to get out fr om this.  After 
this happe ned, I run a wa y.  Of c our
se, let them do.  The first three, 
four people I helpe d the m out, t o ge t out.  Late
r I don't want to risk my
 head, and I  went and I

A: The Russians and the Ameri cans,
 t oget her agai nst Ger ma ny, be ca
use after the war in Russia this  
is the reason they start to
 be mad on the Ger mans. 
 So later they cooperated

Funfteic he n -- bet we en Funfte
ichen, grows rows and things like th
is .  In Funfteic he n, i n Marx- Sta dt, 
you wear cl othi ng, pl ai n clot hi ng 
- -  any clot hi ng.  Wh
en you went to con
cent r ati on camp t o  
Funfteic he n, you went a uni for m.  
They gi ve you a uni for m t o  reco gniz e you, you a 
pri soner.  You 
underst and?  Because
 we was buil ders , a nd over here i n 
concentr ation alread
y.  This was the 
di ffere nce , t he uni for m, stripe s.  Th
ey cal led thi s a possack (ph), stri
pes bl ue a nd whit e , whatever it  
is.  Now, where I a m now?   About run a wa y.  I r
un a wa y 6 o'cloc k in the eve ning, and I ca me to a  
spot by mys elf.  I ca me to a spot north, s out h, e a
st, west , and I 'm i n the  mi ddle .  And I said t o  
mysel f , " Wh at the hell s hould I do 
wit h mys el f ?   Wher e shoul d I go
? "   Go t his wa y, ma ybe I get  
caught over here.  Mayb
e go south, they catch me 
over here.  Till I see a 
little light, like fro m the  
mountains.  You see a 
little light like a candle, ca
ndlelight .  And I sa
id to myself, "I take a chance.  I 
go wher e the light is."  When I ca
me t o the light, c l ose to t he li ght , so I knocke d the door whe r e the  

light is.  Wa s an old lady, and sh
e was knitting a swea
ter or whatever it is, and 
I ask her in this part 
they speak Ger ma n .  And I spe ak Ger ma n , s o I ask 
her, "Can you tell me wh
er e the pol ice i s over  
here? "   Wh e n I aske d he r police , so s he know I am
 not a crimi nal.  Do you under sta nd what I a m 
talking to you?   I ask her where are t h e polic e is ov
er her e, a nd they tol d me the pol ice , you have to 
go over her e t wo mil es  is the po
lice, or three miles. 
 I don't r e me mbe r  exa ctly.  She  gi ve m e  
directi on how t o go.  Wherever she 
go, I we nt the opposite . 
 That  road t o  the pol
i ce, t o get  ca ught.  
Whe n I  went whe n she  ope ne d t he 
door for me  and she  ga ve me  t h
e direction, so I asked her, 
"Maybe you ha ve some t hing t o ea t.
"   She  sai d, " I  ha ve no br ead." 
 I a ske d her for bre ad, and she  
said, "I ha ve  cake ."  Mos tly, i n Europe they ba
ke, you know, c ake .  They c all this i n Cz echis h, t he  
call this moksha (ph).  In th
is area, they speak Ger man an
d Czech, Slovak
ish.  She said, 
"________________."  " I have cake.
"  I said, "Okay."  I never saw 
ca ke for five yea r s.  And she 
give me t he cake.  When she gi ve
 me  the ca ke, I s aid, " Ca n I ha
ve s o me water? "  Ever ybody giv e  
you water .  And I got water a nd c a
ke.  Later I start to be too fr es
h and I ask i f she  ca n gi ve me a  
razor blade to just cut it up, the w
hol e thing, a nd t o run a wa y fur t her. 
 She gi ve me a raz o r blade, s he  
wa s by herself.  Later she got -- she wa s so nice  
to me .  Go d sho uld  re me mb er t his  w o man .  L a ter 
she said to me  a st ory what happ
e ne d with her .  Her da ughte r 's 
hus ba nd, he was  an
 SS ma n, and he  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0348

went to the army.  All th
e families, they're for f
our years, fi ve years in
 the army, and she hated  
Germans.  Yo u never believe it, they called this 
-- we wa s originally I wa s Su deten-De utschland. 
Thi s is bet w een Czechs and Ger man
y.  And t hey spea k, yo
u know, bot h l angua ges .  I  spoke wit h  
her, and s he wa s ver y nic e .  She gi
ve me a razor blades and everythi
ng.  La ter I sai d to mysel f , "I 
got a piece cake, and I got water, 
and I got a razor bl ade.  The onl
y sol ution to t he problem, you 
better go bac k to the c a m p, beca use I get kill ed, I know.
"  So I want you to lis
ten with both ears this 
situati on.  All of a s udde n, t wo more boys, t hey
 ar e run a wa y from t he ca mp, and I met  those t w o 
guys.  Till there was thre
e; thre e is no good.  To
o ma ny is no good.  Ther e  
wa s thr e e .  An d all  o f a  
sudden, we came close, came a -- they
 called this an SI -- they got SS
, t hey got t he black over here, 
the stor m tr ooper s.  And the other one was  SA, was 
t he yell ow uni for ms ,  a di ffere nt uni for m.  And 
the guy came was just in  yellow, a l o cal guy.  He came, " Wha
t the hell you guys doi ng over her e ? 
Where do you come from? "  Told 
hi m we  get  out, we  ba ndi ts.  Th
ey got  all -- I got  sha ved;  the y  
don't.  So he sai
d, "What kind nationality is?"
  One guy said, "I am Polis
h."  The other guy said, "I 
a m Lit huani an,"  what eve r  it is.  Wh
en he c a me t o me , I said, "I  a m 
a J e w."  Yo u hav e  to exc use me ,  
the guy who said Lithua ni a
n, he sai d, " Put on t he pants .  Ope n the pa nts , put  it on.  I wa nt to see ar e  
you circu mc i sed."  He wants t o see , he knows t h ey
 are J e wis h pe ople , the y circu mcise d.  When h e  
did t his , he  s aw t he guys, they was ci rcumci sed.  So
 they both, they told hi
m a lie.  He said he's a  
Ukrainian, or whatever it is, and 
I  sai d I 'm a Je w.  So he said t o
 the guys , " Open yo
ur mout h."  He  
killed them on the spot, both. 
 Both they got kill
ed.  After the liberation, I 
went to looki
ng for.  Are 
they still, or they put hi
m away?  And because I told
 the truth, I am a Jew, 
I survived.  They let me  
live because I don'
t lie to them. 
Q: How did you know to do that?  
A: E xcu se  me?  

Q: How did your i nsti nct
s tell you to do that?  
A: You know, this is 
a very long stor
y to tell you how inst
inct.  Wh en you came 
to a situation, every 
creature, every human being, ever yt
hi ng what is li fe , t a ke  a l o ok at 
t he guy got shot down wit h t h e 
airpla ne .  The guy, for fi ve days, 
he ate wo rms.  Did you hear what 
the guy sai d on t e levisi on?   He  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0348

ate wor ms, he got no food.
  He survived.  Lat er 
they pic k hi m up and t h
ey found hi m, a nd the y  
brought hi m bac k.  Whe n  you ca me t o  a situation li ke
 this , is no diploma cy.  Is no knowl edge, is no 
study.  You coul d be e du
cated, you c oul d be the bigg
est idiot in -- th
e instinct for y
ourself dictate 
you what you shoul d do.  And thi s 
is  life , nothing else .  Not beca
use I was s mart or s marter t ha n  
thos e t wo guys.  I tol d hi m I a m a J e w, I a m not 
asha me d I a m a Je w.  In Marx- Sta dt, I go bac k to  
Marx- Sta dt, to my boss where I went  to work, Dr . 
Visner.  Till we got on
e foreman, a Ger man, fro m  
the compa ny, fr om Dr. Vi sner 's co mpa ny.  He got a  
two- by- four  stick, t wo-by- four, he could gr ab it, 
you know, a nd thi s.  And one ti me he ca me to me. 
 He sa id, "You was ta lking polit ic," to me .  He  

slapped me  i n the face , a nd he repo
rt me and hit me in th
e he ad over here .  You se e over here?   Ca n 
you s ee whe r e he hit me ?   It was 
bloody, bl ood and everyt
hing, okay.  Try to 
why he hit me , and I  
fi gur ed out forget it .  Those wor k thi s wa y.  I n
 Marx- Sta dt when you wa
s -- our group was a bout, 
let 's se e, wh at we were pro ducti ve is  we mak e  
those ci nder bl ocks.  So was maybe ei ght or te n, a  
s mall group.  In t he morni ng when
 we left the gate, the guy put on 
number 1180.  Nu
mbe r s, you ar e  
number, not a na me .  J ust
 a number .  The y put on the numbers . 
 Whe n you come 
bac k, you get the  
numbers bac k.  And he registe red, he  see all the r egiste red t he  sa me a mount people , they don't r un 

away or whatever i t is.  So the 
sa me  guy who hit me  with
 the two-by-fours, he 
report t o  the Ustachi  
(ph) .  Ustachi means the l eader  
fr om the camp  in Marx-Stadt. 
Q: Je wis h or  no t J e wish?  

A: J e wis h, n ot Je wi sh , was mix e d . 
 Or the guy, t h e lea der, he wa s Je
wi sh .  He  g ot a 
leather jacket, a 
pair of boots .  He l ooked like  a n
 SS man.  Really -- a 
real animal .  But this 
guy came , so this guy 
who hit me wit h the  two-by- four , he 
repor t to the Ustachi.  All the complaints go to the Ustachi, to 
this guy.  So he got guys, kapos,
 what ever they receive complai nts, 
they take them 
in a n d the y put  
them on a bench.  Wh en I ca
me in and the Ustachi, 
this guy, the fi
rst thing.  Guilty 
or not guilty?  
No wa y, you are not going.  Fir st he
 slappe d me in the face .  I fa
ll on the floor.  The guy was a 
hus ky, str ong guy.  Whe n I fel l  on 
t h e fl oor , he s a id -- I don't t o me
nti on the langua ge what he s aid 
transl ate i nt o Engli sh, because I wil l be embarr
assed for a lady t o
 say what he sa
id.  Somethi ng  
extra ordi nar y language .  So he sa id t o those kapos, 
he sai d, " Pull down the pa
nts.  Open the pa nts .  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0348  
13 
 
Pull  down t h e pa nts .  La y down on t h e be nc h."   Th
ey got a bench like this. 
 And they gave me  50, 
how should I say it?  I lost my 
l anguage, my vocabulary.  Fi ft y 
punc hes on my hinte r .  For your  
information, on the end 
I could not s tand up.  So
 he throw me down on 
t he fl oor , lie  down like a  
dog.  They will not do this to a do
g.  And later he said, "Stand up, 
you bitch," you k
now.  He said, 
"Sta nd up.  Sta nd up. St and 
up."  And I ca n s tand up 
and I st a nd up.  M y hint
er, you ha ve t o excuse  
me , was -- how s hould I give you a descri ption how 
it wa s?   Ink, red i nk, the whole thi n g.  He s aid, 
you know, "Come tomorrow to 
wor k .  You go on the co mpa ny 
_______."  This
 me a n s on t h e  
phylacte ry, you know, t h ey got a 
r oom.  Lay down in t he bed, and 
from t h is be d peopl e who don't  
go t o wor k, they se nd t o  Ausc hwitz
, for your informat ion.  Because 
they need over  her e pe ople  to 
go t o wor k, beca use t his is a wor king ca mp, not a 
concentr ation camp
.  A worki ng c a mp.  So I  wa s  
two days -- a miracl e was they don'
t s end me to Ausc hwitz, a n d I we nt 
to work the third day.  I was  
prayi ng t o God to go to work.  Wh en I ca me to work and the s a me guy who hit me wit h the two-by-
four, he said, "You know what yo
u did?  You was listen illegal radi
o, news about th
e Germans, that 
they l ost t he  war ."  I sai d, "I neve r -- how you go
t that i dea?  You could 
not even e x plain?   You  
can't e ve n t alk? "   He  s aid he ha d t o list en, not
hing else.  So  this wa
s the two experiences the 
direction run away and got killed 
two guys, and I survived.  The 
guy, he came, he said I was 
listening to illegal ra
dio a bout t he war.   
Q: Wereyou? 

A: We  was talk about politic
s, the Germans has to lose. 
Q: But you didn't have a  r adio?  

A: Positi vel y  no.  Thi s wa s a  fals e t hing t o do. 

Q: When you wer e i n Funfteic he n . . . 

A: Funfteichen, yes. 

Q: . . . Funfteiche n, exc use me
, wer e you doi ng the sa me  ki nd of
 work there that  you had bee n  
doi ng whe n you st arte d i n M arx- Sta dt? 

A: It 's ver y hard t o unde rs tand. 
 A pers on li ke you t o under sta nd th
is .  Ma rx- Sta dt was a preli mi nary  
spot t o build thos e ca mp s for the 
concentration camps.  
We was a regular crew
.  Some , the y was a  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0348  
14 
 
group fr om roofe r s.  Some  was 
plumbers .  I work i n t he ci nder  bl ocks, in c onc rete .  Some wa s  
paint ers .  Some was fra m ers.  So me was -- everyb
ody got a di fferent gr oup, 
worki ng gr oup.  So we  
wa s not dre ssed like c o nce ntrati on people .  We  wa
s dres se d ci vil cl othing, a nd in concentr atio n 
camp everybody got  
mar ks, stri pes. 
Q: I underst a nd that .  Let 's 
change tape while we  . . . 
Q: . . . what I wa nt -- what we 
were talking about when
 we st oppe d is the difference bet wee n Mar x-
Sta dt a nd Funfteic he n.  And what 
I  underst and i s whe n you wer e th
en se nt to Funftei che n beca us e 
your work was done from the  
other camp, what you did ev
ery day in Funfteichen. 
A: Daily routine things. 
Q: Li ke?  

A: Ever y bl ock, ever y block mea ns ever y mobil e
 home .  Mobile home i s easy to underst and for  
you. 

Q: Well , you sai d barra ck, it 's a barra c k. 

A: Is a barrack, ri ght.  
Everybody has 45, 50 pe opl e.  This barr
a ck has to cle an the ba rrac k, cl ean t he  
landsca ping.  Looks bea uti ful  for 
the delegations, to show how go
od t he y  treat t hose people .  Ho w 
nice they lie to people. 
 Everything is clean up. 
 A million thi ngs.  From Funfteic
hen, I was over a 
year .  Then I we nt to Gr oss- Ro
se n in 1944.  Gr oss-Rose n is a n 
additional 45, 50 mil es fr om this  
territor y.  So what t he y did, bec aus e t he Ger ma n f
eel, t he y get  tight er wit h
 the war.  The Russia n,  
Ameri cans, t hey don't let 
the m bre athe ;  24 hours a day, ever y da
y 2 o'cloc k in t he mor ni ng, you c an  
see for your sel f t he li ght s.  Because
 we was i n s helter s, but  t hey bo
mbar d.  So they 
throw it out to 
shelters, so t hey came an
d they li ne up all t he ar eas and they 
s a w people i n uni for ms .  Didn't thr o w 
one  bomb.  They throw bombs just  where they -- 
so this is not the ca m
p.  We ll, I saw my  eye 2 
o'cl oc k, 3 o'c l ock, bec aus e I saw the m .  The y run,
 boy, the y light up like da
ylight.  You coul d ne ve r  
belie ve t his . 

Q: Wh at were you thinking
 when you saw all  these? 
A: Later I st art organize -- not officially -- step by
 step, groups .  And I sai d
 to the guys, "Something 
is to the end."  And they said -- 
s o me , they s aid, " Aa h, you're drea mi
ng.  We finis h s o oner or later . " 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0348

Okay, if I see a guy, he lost the 
marbles and he never th
ink about what will be 
the future with th e 
Germans, I kno w.  Because I belie
ve in the Te n Co mmandm
ents, this is in my
 heart, not in the 
Bible.  Te n Co mmandments 
is my Bible, I beli eve. 
 And I got this in min
d.  Got  to c o me , t he  da y 
must come - -  this is unbe lieva ble.
  This must co me the da y.  At th
e end of '44, we st art up '45, and 
we  se e t hey got  it so s ma cke d is  a ft er Gr oss-
R ose n , we  walk  --  we
 sle ep in t he street . 
Q: Wait , wai t , wait , wait, wait .  You have
n't  tol d me a nyt hing a bout Gr oss- Rosen. 
A: I n Gross- Rosen was a transit ca
mp.  No wor k, nothi ng doi ng.  Wa
it for a transit.  You understand 
transit , what  it mean?  Of a group 
to go.  So t hey coll ect
 500 or 1,000 groups  
walking, not travel . 
Bec ause is no ti me , t he  Ger mans go
t no time to locate
 those people, becaus
e gets tougher  an d 
tougher  a nd t ougher  for t h e m. 
 So  from Gross-Ro sen . . . 
Q: So you were j ust  the r e  a short ti me ? 
A: S o I  was  ma yb e a  wee k.  

Q: And this wa s i n t he be gi
nning of 1945, you thi nk?  
A: In the  beginni ng.  End of
 '44, be ginning of '45.  
Q: Okay. 

A: So t he bi gge st tragedy was in 
Gr oss- Rose n, do you know what the y
 di d?   They t ook 3 or 4,00 0 
people out si de, and they count t he 
pe ople maybe nine ti mes .  The y 
c oul d not c ount it .  They know 
how to count it to make people mi
s er able .  So we 're standing a bou
t thre e hours counti n g:  one, t wo, 
three , four , five, 5,000 pe ople .  Y
ou c an i ma gine, and go ba
ck:   one, two, t hree,
 four , fi ve, six, a nd  
to count to 5,000.  Cold
, rain, s now, mis era ble.  
And you got  the  s hoe s, t h
ey got, you know, fr om 
the wooden -- they call th
is -- fr om wood.  The sole wa s from 
wood.  When you ste p  in in s now , 
you got a poppe d up snow underne at h, a nd t his gets
 sti ff.  So you get -- you get not only cr ooke d 
fe et.  You c annot walk. 
 And later we sleep.  Eve rybody whe n 
we left, the first 
thi ng we took wa s 
blanket .  We  took the bl a nket .  Y
ou got a blanket , he got a  bla n ket. 
 So we t ook thr ee bla nket s, t hre e 
people .  We  cove red up, and on t he  snow for t hre
e, for four, for five da
ys.  I don't reme mb er 
exactl y.  Thi s wa s a short  notice .  And fro m Gr os s- Ro
sen, we went to Buchenwa
ld.  In Buchenwal d  
. . .

Q: How l ong -- I'm sorry. 
 How l ong di d it  take you to wal k t her e ? 
A: To Buchenwald?  I don't know, I really don't remember if we walk or we travel in those

a big ca mp.  Orga niz ed  
camp by nationalities.  The French
 camp, the Poli sh camp, I nt ernat
i onal ca mp and thi s.  You could, 
in Buc henwald, you was  fle xible.

Eve r y ni ght , every ni ght  you see hundre ds of ai rpla

You c ould s ee e verythi ng.  The y do

katsetlers (ph).  Th
is means the concentration 
camps.  And until so

High-cl ass peopl e, thi s was the concentrate ever
ythi ng.  And fr om t hos e people who knows the  
langua ges , t hey sel ect and pr ofes s ion, they s end to The resie

Theresienstadt is located in C
zechoslovakia.  In thi s ar ea, 
they speak Czech
, Slovaki sh and 
Ger ma n y.  And t he y have  kaz za ms .  You know what
 a kazzam is?  No.  Ka zz

street , bec ause Theresi enstadt , the y planni ng t o

 don't got the time to build this.  
They stop with soldiers.  So after

Ameri can war was , in  
1929 i n t he depr essi on?   On e ver y c orner  they st

they're putti ng soup and bread a nd food a fter li bera

he given t he comma nd a nd ever y guy who sai d one  

word, right away he hit him so badl

Is a miracle how si x days
 I was l ooking how t he y marc h, and all

Later we came, the Ameri

 In this age, how you

 I took her  out, a nd she

as a manager.  
She worked as a 
supervi sor/ m ana ger, t hey don't know ma na ger.  S

So she wor k  for a while 
until we got established, because 
Lena, the lady, she was a local pe

later they establish rules and regu

 you don't give 
me this.  This 
was in the beginning.  Later I exp

older brothe r, he got life.  Afte r  
the li berat i on, I  went  to fri ends, an

 When he came back  
and I left  him, a sign, yo

almo st.  I was a little kid, and he was 
the ol der brother.  So he s ay he

let them go to hell.  We  
will stay over here.  Th

Mein Kampf, the book.  Are you

 He wrote Mein Kampf, 
the book, Hitler.  In 
Lands ber g a m Lec h, I went to t he c h aplai n in Ger m

Maybe I wa s  ma ybe four years  ol d. 
 How ca n I re c ognize a pe r son so

" What  ha ppene d my si s t ers, Bella

 At the last 
mi nute, the Nazis, they send them

 I nee d a pair  of

a lady standing in a spot

Lands ber g, ever ybody knows Da vid 
Davis.  Th ey know it, and Fr

active eight hours a day,
 maybe 10 hours a day. 
 Wh en everybody went 
home, we st
ill thinking  
about my br other s and si sters .  

Q: So what was t he har d est 
t hing for you t o a ccomplis h?  
A: The biggest drea m w as our dre a m was t o ge t 
out fr om Landsber g and fi nd dire ct ion what  you

being like e v erybody else .  This one drea m.  The

over and reach t hese dreams?  
A: Wa s ver y  hard.  I like  to ma ke a st ate ment .  M a

The people i n the Unite d State s who wa s bor n over 
here , they do not appre cia

people who ca me t o the  Uni t ed Sta t e s, how we a
ppre ciate t hi s countr y.

They came from the ot he r si

Thi s is t he second.  The t h
ird dream was to start to go
 to school.  Sh e went, my
 wife went to college.  
She  pic k up in Europe , you c an go in
 colle ge i f you don't pic k  up a 
se cond langua ge . 
 You have to  
know t wo la nguages.  So she pi ck 
up Engli sh; for he r, it wa s eas y. 
 Wh en I  c a me 
over here, my  
voc abulary wa s ma ybe 100 word
s Englis h.  So we went -- I went 
to t he high school in Br ooklyn,  
high school education for 
adults.  I  got beaut i ful t eachers, gor g
eous.  God bless t h
em.  What  they 
did for me, those guys.  I reme mb er 
he sai d, "This  is a  pe ncil .  Re peat
 this is a pe nc
il."  Right away, 
how to write  pencil .  The y wa s ver y
 good t o us , to me, t o ever ybody. 
 The fir st step, the y said, stay  
awa y from forei gn languages ne ws papers, ma gazi
nes.  Start reading Ameri can magazi nes and 
Ameri can ne ws pa pers .  I  don't sa y --  they sai d --
 the principal, I don't sa
y you s hould aboli sh or  
liquidate the language what you 
know, whatever it is.  If you w
ill learn quick and 
nice and good  
Englis h, you ha ve t o do t his wa y.  
If you read it, rain, shine, snow --
 we went  to school .  She we nt t o  
colle ge, a nd I went  to the high s chool . 
Q: What yea r  di d you c o
me to the United States? 
A: In 19- --  begi nni ng '49. 

Q: Was it difficult to get a Visa? 

A: Not for me.  Because I put in affi
davit, I put in an affidavit.  I w
ill not collect relief.  I go to work .  
I will not take from the 
government nothing.  I don'
t want support from th
e government.  I will  
support myself.  My mo ney, what 
I brought to the United States $5
0.  That I bought fo r my little  
baby, God bl ess her , my daughter , a  ca rri
age  for  $40, and I  got 
$10 in my  pocket. 
Q: So you ha d a  baby at  Landsber g?  

A: Yes .  

Q: No w, jus t  a cou ple mo re que s
tions .  Throughout  all of thi s pe
riod of ti me, wa s religi on i mport a nt  
to you at  all?  

A: Religi ous -- I am a reli gious person, and I beli eve in the Ten Commandmen
ts .  You don't have to 

read the five  book of M oses .  Y
ou don't have t o read -- be caus e so
me people, they think if the y  
know about the fi ve book of
 Mose s, they got t he Bi
ble and they ar e religi ous
.  They go to c hurc h ,  
the synagogue -- wrong fr om the be
ginning.  In the Jewish tradition, 
we got more than hundreds of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0348  
37 
 
books wit h comment aries about th
e religious.  My religi
on is the Ten Commandm
e nt s.  If you obe y  
the Te n Comma ndme nt s, you
're the most ethi cal pe
rson on t he  globe .   
Q: So this is what carri
e d you t hrough, or  . . . 
A: This kept my  faith, my  Jewishness
 and my reli gious , t h
e Ten Commandments. 
Q: You mentione d a  fe w th
ings  that  when you ca me
 over her e, you had t o wor k, you had to l ear n 
English.  Wa s it diff
icult to st art over? 
A: Very har d.  But , you se e, my l angua ges --  
my l angua ges , what I pos ses s, t he  high- fi delit y 
Englis h, i f t h ey spe ak, I  c an unders tand. 
Q: But in what ot her  
ways was it difficult? 

A: Di ffic ulti es a job.  You ha ve
 to r ealize I wor k for 50 cents an
 hour.  Not beca use  they took 
advantage of me , because I was a re
fuge e or I wa s a fore igner .  N
o, no, no, n
o, no.  I deser ve 50  
cents an hour because what I  di d,
 the  50 ce nts  an hour 
was to get acquainted 
wit h wo r k, t he  sy ste m  
what they ha d.  I did t hings wha t 
I ne ver di d.  I polishe d pe ncil s.  I 
sta rt wit h 50 cents a n  hour.  Later  
the bos s -- a fte r thr ee mont hs, he wa nt me t o ma ke
 ma nager.  Be cause t h os
e guys , they ma ke fi ve  
doz ens; I ma ke 10 doze ns.  The y ma
ke five dozens; I make 15 doz ens ,
 what  I did.  So ri ght a w ay, I  
got guts to go into the boss.  I 
said, "I cannot work for 
50 cents an hour.  I go
t a little baby, and I got  
a wi fe ."  He said, "I give you 75
."  And he start up, you know, th
e guy spea k Je wis h, wa s a Jewi sh  
fore ma n.  And he sai d, " The gre enhorn," I don't wa nt
 to say what he sai d . 
 Somet hing else.  "The  
gree nhorn.  He j ust  ca me .  He li ke t o have righ
t a wa y a l ot of mone y."   
I s aid, "Look, I  nee d mone y  
beca use ,"  in Jewish bec a use I c oul d have a c onver
sation with the guy.  And 
I told him.  Two weeks  
later, I want a dollar, beca
use  I know I de serve.  He sai d, "It 's t oo 
ba d.  I f you cannot
 make by thi s."  
The y like t o ma ke me for e man .  The y  offer me $5  
an hour in this place.  Can you imagine this?  In 
eight  months .  I  ac cept .  Later  I l ook
 for a di fferent j ob.  Cult ure j ob,
 job wh at I know best.  I was in 
printi ng lit hography a nd four-c ol or 
se parati on.  War is the bi ggest 
cri minal for pe ople who make t he  
war .  The y s hould be  punishe d b
ecause they pr ovoke 
and t hey orga nize  t he war s
, is the number one. 
After this what happ
ened in Hitler's time , afte
r 50 years, no improvemen
t.  We got the Ku Klux 
Klan.  We got mi litias.  They 
kill senators, congressm
en, policeman, 
everybody.  Is no law and

order and they don't get what they
 deserve.  We  have 
to bring Americ
a to culture, to
 rehabilitate 
thos e cri mi n als to ma ke t he m pe op
le.  All the jails, they
 full with criminals wi
t h rapi ng, no re spe ct  
for women, no respect for kids
.  Women classi fied as second cit izen
s .  They never wa s in the hist ory 
in a country, what the y do.  And thi s has to be
 stoppe d onc e forever.  
We don't want no more  
concentr ation camps.  We don't -- 
we have to go to basic to brin
g Ame r ica -- and histor y, i f the y  
bring America to this tradition what
 America is supposed 
to be, there will be 
no more concentration 
camp.  The histor y wil l  recognize Ameri can --
 what Ame r ica suppose d
 to be and what our 
Constitution said what the citizen, every citizen,
 should benefit fr om Am
erica because everybod y 
deser ve  the s a me t hing. 
Conclusion of inte rview.
