F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today.
  
Ithinkthis is thef ourth tim e you've been with us over the last four orfive years.
 
Let
™
s get started because you have an awful lot to share with us in a short time.  
 
 
W orldW ar II began inSeptember
 
1939 with Germ any's invasion of Poland. The 
f o llo w
i n g Ma y,  May
 
1940, Germany invadedFrance.  You were just 1 1/2 years oldat thetim e.  
Bef ore you turnto the war years, pleasetell us what you canabout your parentsand what their

lif em ay have been like in pre
-
war Paris knowi ng thatbecause you were so young you don't 
have m em ories of those early years but you've learned some things in the years since.
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, I was 11m onthsoldwhenW orld
 
W ar II started. I was put in 
hiding 
when I was about 2 years old. Strictly speaking, I do not rem em berm y parents atall.  I know I 
lived with them
 
but that's about it. So how 
do 
I 
know anything aboutm y parents? W ell, in 
1984 Ifound outthat Ihada cousin living in Paris who li ved with us as afamily.  She sentm e 

a letter and wrote about nine pagesof m y history.  T hat was thef irsttim e I really found outany 
signif icant inf orm ation about m y family.
 
 
As she says here
 
--
 
I'll paraphrase it
 
--
 
m y parents who had come f rom  Poland to 
escape anti
-
S em it is m  
cam e toParis in theearly 1930s
.  A
s you k
now, once W orld War II 
started, the anti
-
Sem itism  did not disappear. It got worse.  And it's still going on.  But that's 
another issue. And what she tellsm e isthatm y parents were poorpeople, lived with other 
Polishf oreigners.  And they worked in the
 
clothing industry. T hey took careof  their kids,my 
sister and I, likeall parentsdid. But in 1941 or so m yf ather was taken to atransit camp, 

P it h ivie rs .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we talk about that, you know that they were i n the clothing industry.
 
>>
 
Jacques Fein:  I know
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because of  what you've read.  Absolutely.  Do youhave any idea what life 

m ay have been likef or Polish Jews who hadcom e toParis?
 
>> Jacques Fein: That's a good question, but 
I ™ll h a ve  
todeal with itfor next year.  Ihave to 

research it.  I'm  pretty sure they were ver y poor. T hey lived in the poor section of Paris, inthe 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

outer sections. T hat's all I know.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Have you learned whether or not youhad an extendedfam ily, cousins, aunts, 
uncles?
 
>>
 
Jacques Fein:  I did have auntsanduncles.  Inthat picture where you saw my parentsand 
m y cousins,m y fatherwas on the lef tand m y sister was on the lower right.  But I didhave 
other relatives. W hathappened was a lot ofthem  did not survive.  T hey were murdered at 
A u sch wit z.  
>> Bill Benson:  And you've been able to learn that inthe years since the war.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I know that you're beginning to tell us
 
--
 
>> Jacques Fein:  My First Fam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yeah. W e'll talk more about what you've learned about what happened to 
your parents.  You started to tell us about thetransit cam p.  I know thatmost of the details 
about your parentsbeing roundedupand sent to cam psand laterdeported are pretty m uch 
unknown 
to  
you, but as you said, you believe your f ather was takenin 1941 and yourmother 
thefollowing year, in July of 1942.  Have you been able to learn anything about the 

circum stances in which your father was roundedupand taken?  And you knowf or afactthat 
he
 
--
 
>> Jacques Fein:  In sim ple term s
 
--
 
well, Paris was ground zero for the Jews of  France and 
especially Paris because most of the Jews lived inParis.  So asf aras Jewish people being 
deportedeventually to Auschwitz, thef oreignm en were f irst taken
 
--
 
sorry, f oreign Jewish m en

were f irst taken. And then in July
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwould have been yourfather.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  My cousin's letter says
 
--
 
if I could read it.  Yeah, he was taken with Sara's 
father in May
 
1941 to 
P it h ivie rs
, a  tra
nsit cam p south of Paris.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what a transit cam p
 
--
 
what doesthat mean? 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Itmeans it'sa place where people were being sent asa holding placefor 
thenext step. T he French police, the Frenchgovernm ent, in coordin
ation enforced by the 
Germ an governm ent knew that thenext stepwas Auschwit z
,  go
ing by trains and all.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said
, 
soa holding cam p.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  My m other went to
 
Drancy, 
one worse than Pithiviers.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathave you learned about Pithiviers?
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Not toom uch except it was m ostlyf orm en.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And close to Paris.
 
>> Jacques Fein: Thesouthern part of Paris.
 
>> Bill Benson:  How are you ableto getthe photograph of your father that we saw? 
 

>>
 
Jacques Fein: W ell, we'll have to gof astforward. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e can com eback to that ifyou want. 
 

>> Jacques Fein: Since you askedm e that question.  In 1984, I went to
 
--
 
If ound out Ihad a 
c o u s in  livin g in  P a ris  f or t h e f irs t  t im e in m y lif
e
, a
 
blood cousin. SoI went with m y kids to Paris 
to visit them.  Andthen she gave me a letter. B
ef o r e I  
went, she wrote me a letterthat she 
gave m e som epictures of m y fam ily at that tim e.

>> Bill Benson:  So photos that were sent toher.
 
>> Ja cqu e s 
Fein:  Right. So197
3  
--
 
1984
 
--
 
I came here in 19
4 8  
so 36 years after I came to 
the United States.
 
>> Bill Benson: W as that thef irstphoto youhad seen of your father?
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ow.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Just as an aside,m y sister is two years younger thanI. Somehow she 
knew about m y cousins living in Paris.  How I foundoutm ore aboutthat, April
 
1983 there was 
a gathering in the United States of American
-
Jewish Holocaust survivors inW ashington.  I 
went.  Then I opened up
 
and Itried tof igure out the next
 
--
 
you know, what had happened the 
f irs t  s ix ye a rs  o f  m y lif e.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  And I'm  hoping thatbefore we end today you m ightsay m ore about what that 
was like f or you to begin learning those things about yourf am ily all of these years later.  But 
we'll com e backto that.
 
 
From  what you know af ter yourf ather was taken andbefore your mother was also 
caught ina Germ an roundup, before she went somehow she was able toarrangef or youand 
your sister to be hidden with this French Catholic fam ily. W hatdo you know
 
--
 
before we turn 
to going intohiding, what do you know aboutthe roundup that your m other was taken in?
 
>> Jacques Fein: They were f orced to do that. T he Jews hadto register with the authorities.  
T he  po o
rforeign Jews lived in a certain section of Paris, so they knew where they were.  
Peoplef ollowed along.  And brutally.  It wasn't saying, hey, let
™
s walk  to this transit cam p. 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

T hey just shoved them
, p
ut them in trucksand took kids in a terrible m anner.
  
T here's a movie, 
ﬁLa Raf le,ﬂpartof  it you can see the process.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that particularf ilm  was about probably the single largest roundup of Jews 
in Franceever.  Tell us a littlebit about that.T hat was the subject
 
--
 
>> Jacques Fein: That was the biggest roundup. But basically there were other roundups. It 

wasn't the only one. Ibelieve m y m other was taken right around that time.  I'm not quite sure.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think
 
--
 
you don't think shewas taken inthe big one in which 1
3  
--
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I don't think so
; 
around that tim e, 
‚
4 2,  
‚
4 3.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T o spenda m om ent on theVelodrom e
 
roundup, you toldm e some 13,000 
Jews were roundupand then deported to transit cam pand thenoff to places like Auschwitz.  
So what have you learned about yourm other's roundup?  Ithink you think she may have been 
captured or grabbed on the Metro system ?
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, two things.  First of all, I was already in hiding with m y sister in 1941 or 

™
42
, e
a r l y 
‚
42.  I believe and I'm pretty surethat m y m other would visit us,m y sister and I
,  
i n 
secret. Butat that time you alsohad to wear
 
--
 
Jews had to wear ayello w star.  And she 
probably did.  Andf rom  what Iunderstand,when I visitedf am ily
 
who hid me, visited them  in 
19
84  
o r  85
 
--
 
Iforgot exactl y.  It seem s that sheforgot to wear her yellow star and she 
panicked
 i
n the Metro. And she was thentaken.
 
>> Bill Benson:  On the Metro.
 
>> Jacques Fein: Sopeople were scared. They were terrif ied.T hey didn't believe what was
 
happening. 
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
>> Bill Benson:  Andf rom  what you know, asyou said am om entago, she was taken to a 
different cam p than your father.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  It was coldand terribleduring that tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Have you learned anythingm oreabout what Dran
cy wa s like ?
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Just from  reading. Therewas
 
a terribly cold
 
--
 
the worst
 
you can imagine.  It 
wasn't a concentration cam p.  It was where people were
 
--
 
there were hardly any bathroom  
facilities, hardly any food,hardly any water, hardly an
y lif e .
 
>> Bill Benson: T housandsof people crammed into these cam ps.You know and you've 
learned that your parents were eventually deported toAuschwit z where they were m urdered.  
Do you know when they were taken to Auschwit z
 a
nd how long they were ther
e  bef o r e t hey 
were killed? 
 

>> Jacques Fein:  How long I'm not quite sure
, 
but m yf ather was taken
 
--
 
well, there were 
different convoys, trains, going f rom  Paris toAuschwitz.  T here were maybe 50, 60 convoys.  

Som y f ather was taken under convoy num ber 4, which was in July
 
1941.  Andm y m other, 
convoy num ber 58or som ething
, 
51
, w
hich was in 1943, Ibelieve. How she survi ved two 
years
 
--
 
I'm  not quite sure exactly when shewas taken to Drancy.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. And, of course, what you were just implying a m om entago is that the 

Nazis kept suchm eticulous records that youactually know the number of the convoys.  You've 
learned that
,  
that your parents were taken on.
 
>> Jacques Fein: Also, I was reading the letter that m y cousin senttom e in Janua
ry
 
1984.  
And she specif ied
 
--
 
she had a
 
--
 
she wasf ive years older than I was.  So if  I was 3or 4 years 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
old, 3 years old in1941, she was 8 years old.  And she has apretty good memory.  Shetold 
m eexactly the convoys that m yf ather was in and m y mothe
r.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you explained tous a mom ent ago,before yourm other was taken 
s he 

som ehow was able toarrange f or you andAnnette to go into hidingwith the Bocahutf am ily.  
And you would rem ainwith them until theend of  the war. T ell us what you
 
can about the 
Bocahutsand what your life was like with them  to the extent that you know
 a
n d if  yo u  k now 
anything at all about how your m otherm ay have been able to arrange for you to go intohiding 
with the Bocahuts.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  How did I get into hiding? In Paris there was a Frenchorganization called 

Oeuvres deSecours aux 
Enfants 
whose m ission was to save asmany Jewish kids as 
possible. T hey probably sa ved about10,000kids or so. So they, wi th the cooperation of my 

parents, or m y m other def i
nitely, agreed toput me in hiding.  For any parent to say, ok,m y 
child, you're going to go in hiding it's got tobe a very diff icult decision.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Unimaginable, I im agine,f orm ostof us.
 
>> Jacques Fein: Sofrom  thatpoint m y mother
 
and f a
ther were heroes. T
hey resisted the 
persecutionof  Jews. So it was a key Jewish organization, OS
E
. As you m entioned
, 
before I 
becam e co
-P
resident. Sofastforward into the last20 years.  In 1994, we formed
 
--
 
we , th e 
kids who were chosenduring the war and saved by OSE
,  
f orm ed OSE
-
US A .   I t ' s lik e  a  
network.  And what we doalso is raisem oney and sendm oney to OSE in 
Pa r i s .
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  S o is O S E  s t ill s a vin g k id s  t od a y?
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, it's different.  It'sa special service agency.  It ha
s a different m ission 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

than it did during the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Does it run orphanages today?
 
>> J
acques Fein: Af ew.  But in France it's like a social agency.  It expands outsideof  Fran
ce  
into Israel and Morocco and N
o rt he rn  Af ri c a.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So your m other somehow or possibly your f ather were able to work with OSE, 
f ind a hiding placefor you.  Tell us about theBocahutfam ily.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I must have been there roughly 1941.  Ihid with my sister.  My sister was  

born in August
 
1940.  I 
lived there. I don't recall any terrible memories over that time
; e
xce p t I 
know we had tobe very quiet.  T hef am ily took care of us. And I rem em ber two or three 

incidents.  Oneday m y fosterfather putm y sister and I in aditch with ablanket over us. 
 
And I 
could see
 
--
 
I still can see itnow.  Maybe 100
 
yards awa y, soldiers with guns with dogs.  And 
obviously they were looking for Jews or resistantf ighters, people of that nature.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that is oneof  theearly m em ories that you have.
 
>
> Jacques Fein:  One ofm y early m emories.  Anothertim ef or whatever reason I was sick, I 
hadanearache. I was senttoa hospital in Paris.  Ifound out later that thefather tookm eout 

as quickly as possible from  thehospital.  Andwhen I went to visit the fam ily in 1984or so, they 
toldm e that hospital was raided by the German police or the French police. Sohad he not 
done what he did, I would never be here today. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> Jacques Fein: And again, it wasn't as if  Iwas li vin g in
 
fear because
 
--
 
the other thing, I was 
too young to understand what was going on. Nobody

we didn't have television, internet.

;  
this is what's happening.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. And you wouldn't know that.  I'm  sure they protected youf orasm uch 
as possible. Butas you saidam om ent ago,you do rem em ber anatm osphere of having to 
rem ain quiet. Is there anything m ore you can say about that?
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, that was thenature of thetim e of being inhiding.  You could not 

d ivu lge
 
--
 
the fam ily could not divulge who wa s being hidden or elsethatfam ily would have 
been killed im mediately.  And I wouldnever be here.
  
Not only that, thatfam ily, but their kids.  
Fortunately the neighbo
rs were not any trouble.  So that'sm y secondf am ily.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Bocahuts. That's right. Have you learnedanything f rom your subsequent 

visits about the Bocahut fam ily to have any insight as tohow they would explain the presence 
of  two youngsters in their house? 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Well, this is very tough.  I lef t their placeaf ter thewar.  T he
 
war was ending 
in  P a ris ,  in  
France, rather, August
 
1944.  It ended May
 
8, 1945.  I was takenout of that hom e.
 
T he key thing after that was the particular relationship between them and I because it would 

have been im possible.  The m issionaf ter thatwas to try to reunite me andmy sister with m y 
fam ily.  It would have been very diff icult
 g
iven all thedynam ics.
 
>> Bill Benson:  For the period you were with  theBocahuts, alm ostfour years, I believe, they 

raised you as Catholics.  Do you know anything about that? 
 
>> Jacques Fein: All Iknow I was baptized.  I don't remem berany prayers.  I don't remember 

anything

records
 
--
 
the OSE Paris hadfantastic records.  And I visited them  in 1984.  And I copieda 
bunch of records that they had.  Ihad som ef rom  living in New Jersey but I was ableto create 

part of m y history.
 
>> Bill Benson:  From the records andf rom  conversations with the children andthe Bocahuts 

what do you know about theirf am ily?
 
>> Jacques Fein: They were good people, in ver y sim ple term s. W hen Judee and
 
I  vis it e d  
t h em
 
--
 
Iforget what day it was
, 
2000or so. T hey were ver y sim ple people. I think they said it 
was the right thing to do.
  
Andalso,Paris being ground zero is diff erent than living on af arm  in 
the countryside.  Lessdangerous but still had
 
to be careful.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At great risk them selves.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know did they hideany other Jewish children?
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I believe they did but I'm  not sure.  I'm  not really sure. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your sister Annette, of course, was I think almost two years younger than you.  
Has she learnedf rom you what you know about theBocahuts?
 
>> Jacques Fein: Basically, m y sister, two years younger than I, she m oved to Israel in 1962.  

Shedidn't deal with her hiding or the Holocaust.  Itdidn't really happen until 
--
 
our groups have 
conf erencesonce a year.  Iforgot which year it was, m aybe 2008 or2009, she cam e toa 

m eeting
 a
nd then realized that she was in the Holocaust in hiding.  She kind of sort of opened 
u

done.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I hope so.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So asyou said, Jacques, you lived with theBocahuts until the war nearPar
is  
and in France ended in August
 
1944.  You were not quite 6, I think,when D
-
Day occurred, and 
you were 6 1/2 whenthe war itself was over.  As a6
-
year

old, do you have any m em ories
 
--
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Yes. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Ok. 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Of the war. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Of the war.
 
>> Jacques Fein: So the onething I rem em ber, it musthave beenobviously af ter the 

liberation of  Paris or it could have been after the war ended.  
I
t wasa hot summ er day.  All the 
townspeople
 
--
 
it was a place called
 
V e rs
-
Galant, wentout to the highway to the main road.  All 
we saw was the Americans

the alliedtroops com ing in, in their tanks and waving f lags and 
throwing candy to all the kids. And everybody was shouting.  I didn'tknow it was the end of 

the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Right. You knew candy was being thrown.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Hershey bars candy.  It was ver y

people were shouting. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that you do rem em ber.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Most definitely rem em ber that.

in Augustof  1944.  Ofcourse, it would continue inEurope until May
 
1945. W hen the war 
ended,OSE, the organization that had put you into hiding with theBocahuts, rem oved 
you 
f rom  th e i r 
home and took you 
to  
anorphanage.  And later you andAnnette were moved toyet 
another orphanage where you would stay until 1948. T ellus what you know aboutthe 

circum stances of them com ing inand saying now we' ve got to takeJacques and Annette and 
ta k
e them  elsewhere.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Getting out I'm  not quite sure what happened.  I was 6 years old.  My sister 

was 4.  At that age you follow the program .  And that was the plan. I didn't really have any 
otheroptions. So wewere f irst put inan orphanage near the coastof  Brittany.  People 
som etimes think of orphanages as being terrible and lonely places,kids. Well, this was exactly 
theopposite.  Because we cam eoutof  thehiding, num ber one. And we learned about
 
--
 
we  
were f ed. W eplayedwith kids.  So it was very goodf orus.  So that was my third fam ily.  

Because then we went to another orphanageoutside of Paris and the sam e thing.  But we 
learned more. W eknew m ore about what was happening.  And that was m y f ourthfam ily.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he
 
second or
phanage.  Doyou have any recollection of what it was likefor 
you to be takenf rom the Bocahutf am ily to move f rom  there? 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I don't remem ber. I rem em berboth orphanages.  One was by the coast of  

Brittany, going to the oceanand
 
learning. And the other thing is, allthe kids who were there 
were in the sam e situation.  Most of us knew thatour parents or ourfam ily were no longer 

alive.  So everybody was in the same boat
, 
so to speak.  It's not like one hadm orem oney or 
le ss m on
ey or one had parents living and others didn't.

>> Bill Benson: T hef irst orphanage you went to, theone in Brittany, I think you were therea 
shor
t period.
 
>> Jacques Fein: About a year.

I th in k

stayed atT averny until 1948.  Do
 
yo u

m ore m emories of  that
?
  
And you described it to m eas alm ost like achateau. T ell usabout it.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  It was a
 
chateau.  T hat's wh y. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's why you called it that. Ok.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Jacques Fein: Exactly.  I got there roughly in the early 
‚
47, I believe, and left in 19

Buchenwald. T hey were 
sent
 
toTaverny because it was a very orth odox

Jewish orphanage 
at that tim e.  Inever was there at the sam e tim ethat he was.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You cam e in a later group.
 
>> Jacques Fein: About a year, year anda half later. But, again, the main thing is we wer e all 
in the sam e situation and we played. It was goodtous. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  It'salso aplace where you were really reestablished with your Jewish identity.  

Can you tell us a little bit about that,
 
to theextent you remember?
  
Again, you were ver y 
young.
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, while I was in hiding I don't know what we did, but I was baptized. I'm

I'm sure.  AndI'm  sure I didn't know anything about being Jewish.  Butonce 
we were out, S
ha
b
batservice was ver y im portant. T he Jewish holidays was ver y im portant.  
I'm  not quite sureabout learning Hebrew andbeing with other Jewis h kids andbeing 
su p

>> Bill Benson:  And what was 
OS E
' s  ro l e
 w
ith these two homes?
 
>> Jacques Fein: They had two hom esbutthey hadm any otherhom es.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere operated by OSE.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  During the war they were in secret, resisting the Germans as much 
as they could. And af ter the war
 
--
 
If orgot how m any orphanages they had
; u
nfortunately quite 
a num ber becausem any kids hadnom ore parents.
 
 
So at that tim e, especially when we went toTaverny, they were reuniting me with m y 
aunts and
 
--
 
reuniting m e with m y aunts anduncles would have been im possible.  Some of 
them  had come backf rom  Auschwitz.  T hey had their own kids to take careof. 
T
hey could not 
take care of two m orekids.  T he situation would have been extremely difficult.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know if the OSEf olks, did they attempt to try to find if  there were living 
relatives?
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I'm sure they did.  But I'm not quite surehow they were able to connect all 
th e  d o ts.  B ut, a

little bitm oreabout that in am inute. 
 
 
Of course, this isPostwar France.  Do you have any idea what conditions were like?  
W asfood scarce in those times? 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I could read history, but where I was

>> Bill Benson:  Notan issue?
 
>> Jacques Fein:  It was not an issue.  I'm  sure we had enoughf ood for the kids.
  
And m aybe 
it wasn't enough. T he fact that we cam eoutof  hiding, playing, eating and all of that, was not 
super
,  
duper important.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jacques, do you know at wh at point youunderstood that your natural born 

parents 
--
 
you 
would not see them
 
again?
 
>> Jacques Fein: That's a good question.  Iprobably knew by the tim eI was in the 

orphanages in 1947, 
‚
46.  But I don't rem em ber themoment. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, I know you're going to tell us in amom entaboutbeing 

adopted by the Feinsfam ily.  Tell us about that. That was 1948. T his Am erican couple, the 
Feins, com e tothe hom e where you were.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  First of all,m y parents,m y adoptive parents, they couldn't have any 

children. They were actually f rom  Russia. They cam e tothe United States in 1920s.  She 
couldnothave any children. As you know, by 1945, 
‚
48, there werea lotof kidsavailable in
 
--
 
orphans in France. They were ver y well connected tothe Jewish organizations of  New Jersey 

and New York.  T hey were not religious, butthey were connectedto the religion
 a
nd the

organizations.  Ihad no idea why but they woundup going to the orphanage where I was, 
T averny, with m y sister.  They visited there.  Irem em ber seeing them . We were playing, I 
think.  From  what I understand, they saw m y s ister.  She was two ye ars younger.  Probably 
when they camem aybe she was 6 1/2, 7. T hey wantedher. The Director of the orphanage 
said good.  But there was abut.
 
[Laughter]
 
T hey said it's apackage oftwo.  Sothey obviously agreed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did they comeback to the UnitedStates andthen return to get you? 
 
>> Jacques Fein: They came to France, to the orphanage.  Ithink we visited with them in a 
hotel in Paris. They went back to the UnitedStates.  I don't rem ember if  they came back 
again.  But October
 
8,1948, we lef t the orphanage

And we went to Marseille and then to the United States.  Arrived in

you 
come to the United States?
  
>> Jacques Fein: By boat. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You cam e by ship.
 
>> Jacques Fein:  If you remember
 
--
 
I was at a retreatfor our federationboard last 
September. And a young
 
lady who was in charge said,"W hen youwere 10 years old, what did 
want to be?"  So everybody said I want tobea doctor, a nurse, a teacher. And I said
 
I was on 
a boatf rom  Franceto the United States andall I wanted to know was what my lif e was going 
to be here.

approaching New York , a lot of people wentto the side.  And I was wondering wh y.  It was  a 

foggy day.  I realized they were looking

they sa w the Statue of Liberty.  And that was the

because you know there's a big difference.  You know you had a history.  So that was quitea 
bit of a difference.

group.  At the beginning they wrote me letters.  And oneof  them  was 
F e lic e
; w
rote m e a letter, m issedm e, wanted to know how it was in the UnitedStates. In the 
m eantim e m y parents would sen
dm oney to the OSE, to theorphanage.  She toldm ethatwith 
them oney that they received, they went toacircus in Paris. They wanted you to know how 
things were going. 
 
 
So skimm ingf orward to April
 
1983, the gathering ofAmerican

.  T
here was a breakup of tables

Germany, Hungary, France,of

of  us wentthere.  When you talk to people, you play like geography so she sa

Felice.  I said, I know Felice

Ihave a letterf rom  som eone named Felice.  I lived in Columbia,

which was

the kinds of things you've learnedf rom  reading 
the OSE records about your case, if  you will.  T hey hada dossier onAnnetteand on Jacques.  
W hat kinds of things did you learn?

not a survivor, per se, but the child 
o f  a  su

than it was in the

had been children like you?

s see.  In the late

70
s 
--
 
and Regina knows
 
--
 
there was a group in 
theW ashingtonarea,shalom  group, calledShalom . That was comprom ised of survivors, but 
they were m ostly survivors who had lived, who had survived concentration camps or ghettos.  I 
never went to a concentration cam p.  I go to the D

I was too young to

you still have any connection with the Bocahuts today, any fam ily?
 

>> Jacques Fein:  No. First of  all,once we left the orphanage, their home, we broke up the 
relationship.  It was alm ostnecessary.  I don't have anything except for the tim e we visit
ed
.  
T he reasonI was ableto visit was because the OSE records were so accurate. I went to their

York, were stayin g in our developm ent. W e called them . They were  driving because they 
have relatives in Virginia. T hey were just about to leave. T hey picked us up and we got here 
by 10:30 without any problem.  If it wasn'tf orthem

I'm sure we would have m ade it
, 
b ut I 
have no idea whattime we would have beenhere.  You deserve a special thank you. 
 
>> B i

>> Jacques Fein: And m y wif e was the one

Judee was theone who said, "C

Lynn."   I said, go ahead
.  W
hatever she wants. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you.  Let
™
s turn to our audience an
d see if  our audiencehasany 
questions they'd like to ask of you. W ehaveonehand shotupalready.  If you wait until we get 
a m icrophone. It'sbeing passed to you now.  Make questionsas brief as you can. If  I need to 
repeat it soeverybody hears it,
 
including Jacques, I'll do that.  If it's brief , that will help us. 
 
>> Do you know if  theOSE, is that the organization that was like Sara's train where they were 

sending children to be adopted? I didn't know if  that was theorganization. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n: T he Kindertransport?
 
>> Yes. W ere they connected? 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  It's som ewhat sim ilar.  But theKindertransport were kidsfrom Austriaand 

Germ any, about 10,000 sent to England. England opened up itsdoors to them. TheOSE 
group was part of  France. T hey did save kids fromAustriaand Germ any.  Some of them were 
sent to actually to France.  So it's som ewhat sim ilar.  But it was basically saving kids, staying in 
France.

>> J a c
ques Fein:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you.  Do we have another questionf rom  ouraudience?  Gentlem an 
right here. W e got the m icrophone com ing toyou here. 
 
>> Af ter you lef t theBocahutf am ily, how were you ableto reconnectwith your Jewish identity?
  

Andhow im portant is it to you now?
 
>> Jacques Fein: Thesecond part is very im portant. I've been involved, as people know here, 
with the Jewish community andthe non
-
Jewi sh com munity also. But Idef initely am  connected 
with the Jewish community.  
 

 H
ow did I connect?  At that time we were all in hiding
, m
y sister and I.  I didn't know 
anything about what religion we were doing, but I was baptized according tomy records.  But 

the OSEpeople, when they took usout, their prim em ission was since they could not reunit
e  
us with ourf am ily was tom ake sure that we were
 
--
 
reconnect us with our Judaism . Soby 
going to services, Jewish religion, the holidays, and religious school to somedegree.  And the 
regular school. I went to a regular school inTaverny
 
with the other kids, the kids that were 
living in T averny, I assume. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So itwas a French public schoolfor education.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right. So that was their mission, alsoto reconnect us with our Judaism .  

Good question. 
 
>> B ill 
Benson: T hank you.  A questionover here.

child? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Interesting question.W hatadvice would you gi ve to somebody considering 
adopting orf ostering a young child? 
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, m y sonand his wif eadopteda baby, basically, f rom scratch

the 
beginning.
 
[Laughter]
 
From  day one. And they 
did 
some research. My parents adoptedme. T here's no way of  
knowing how it's goin g to work out.T hey need tobe supportive of  who they adopt.
 
  
I'm  sure 
therehave been cases where adoption doesn't work.  I was ver y luc ky.  Because I was 
adopted at the age of10
; 
I had a major history that I knew about. 
 
 
I'm  nota psychologist, but to support whoever you're getting.  I've heard recently that 
kids who were adopted from  Russia but they were not in tophealthand they sent them back.  
T hat's likea no
-
no. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hanks, Jacques. Thank youf or that. W ehave aquestion right here. 
 
>> You said that
 
yoursister didn't necessarily consider herself having been in the Holocaust.  
Is that comm onf or people who are in your sort of  situation, where they weren't in cam ps? 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just so people in the back
 
--
t
he question was
 
--
 
you com mentedon y
our 
sister didn't think of  herself  som uch asa survi vor.  T he question is
:  W
as t ha t  c om m on wi th  
people who had been through sim ilar circum stances as youand your sister? 
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, typically speaking

when I askpeople
 Œ 
s ay
:  T
h e H o
l o c au
st, wh at 
com es to yourm ind? People say concentration cam ps, horrible, you know, no way of

survi vin g concentration camps
, a
bsolutely unbearable, ghettos. Butwe were so young.  And in 
hiding some people didn't think they were survi vors.  So it really didn't happenuntil 40 years in 
the UnitedStates. And 40 years is am agic number in life
, m
id
-
lifecrisis.  You want to know 
what's happening to you.  Like Mosestook the Jews
 
--
 
40 years. W henever he was.  Into the 
prom ised land. 
 
 
So the answer is, yes. 
 
A lotof people of thatage didn't think they were survivors but 
eventua
lly they dealt with it.  I think m y sister is dealing with it better. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou think about the lossesf or you, thebottom line is your parents were 

takenf rom  you andm urdered in Auschwit z.  Your life was constant upheaval f or years after 
thatuntil you settled inthe UnitedStates. 
 
>> Jacques Fein: Theother thing is in term sof  differentf am ilies, I was married once. My f if th 

fam ily.  And thenbecause of Judee is
 
m y s ixt h f am ily a n d  ou rf am ily.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  I think that we've got one more question and then we're going to close our 

program .  I'll turn back to Jacques to close it in am om ent. Young man inthe green shirt inthe 
m iddle.  A m icrophonefor him? 
 
>>W hat was your f irst feeling or thought when youf ound out aboutyour history, aboutthe 

war, and hiding,and your parents? W hat was your f irstfeeling? 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwas your f irstfeeling when youfoundout what you had beenthrough?
 
>> J a c qu
es Fein: That is a good question.  Unf ortunately the only answer I have is I really 
don't remember how I felt atthat time. I could have been7 years old or 9 years old.  

Rem em ber, Ididn'thave any f am ily.  I was basically
,  
f rom  a feeling point of  view,
 
relationship

pointof  view, we were on our own.  So therewas nobody totell meor rem ind me of what had 
happened. But Ido know what happened.  Andm y f eeling is that a lot of people went through 
horrible, horrible conditions.  And som e of ussurvi ved. 
 
S om e  d i d  not .
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you for that question.W e're going to close in amoment.  I want to

back to Jacques to close ourprogram  in justa moment.  I wanttomention two things before I 
do that. 
  
W hen Jacques'sf inished, can youstay f oraf ew m inutesfor people whohave other 
questions?
 
>> Jacques Fein: 
 
Oh, yeah.
