Lechenich,a sm all town outsideof  Cologne. Jill and her older sisterpicnicked in the Eifel 

Mountains in1937 with theirm other, Clara, and their aunt anduncle.
 
 
T he Nazis cam e to power shortly bef ore Jillwas born in 1933. OnNovember
 
9 , 
1938, 
the Nazis carried out a nation
-
wide Pogrom  against Germ any's Jews, known as 
Kristallnacht, or Night of  Broken Glass. Alerted to the danger, Jill and her f am ily f led to 

Cologne.
 
 
Here we see ahistorical photograph of Germans passing by a vandalized store o
f a  
Jewish shopkeeper.
 
 
Jill's f am ily decided to em igratef rom Germany and in June
 
1939, they lef tfor Kenya.

[Applause] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Jill, thank you som uchf or joining us today andf or your willin gness to be our 
First Person today and, of  course,to 
K u rt
 
for doing the sam e for us tom orrow.
 
 
Jill, you have a lot to share with us.W ehavea pretty short period, so we'll just start 
if  that's ok.
 
>> J ill P a u
l y:
 
Very good.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You told me thatKristallnacht, the Nightof  BrokenGlass, in November
 
19 38 ,  
was the catalyst f or the decisions and direction that yourf am ily's lifetookfor the balance ofthe 

Holocaust and the war. You were ver y young at the tim e,about5 years of age. Let's startf irst 

with you telling us a little bitabout yourf am ily bef ore the war and the events that led up to 

Kristallnacht.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
I rem ember m y fam ily f rom a vantage pointthat perhaps other children don't 
becau
se allof m y lif e in Germ any, 98% was insidem y parents' home. Ididn't goanywhere
, 

e
xceptf am ily som etimes. So I can only say what I learnedf rom m y parents.
 
T hey had been in 
Germ any for maybe 300, 400 years, Idon't know, ancestors way back. I've been able to 

research through 1699.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Through 1699. W ow.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
I can't go before that becausebef ore that the Jews of Germ any were known by 
their Hebrew nam es; didn't have regular names, what we call regular names. You can'tf ind 

t h em  be c a
usem y f ather would have been Joseph, son of  Maier, JosephBen Maier. And there 
were a lot of people with that name, so it was notpossibletof ind them  in that sense.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But you can go back 300 years.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ye s .
 
T here was a law that was putoutby the churches, I believe, in the 1600's, 
thatthe Jews in the Rhine land were allowed to work in two professions
; o
ne was 
horse
-
trading
; t
heother was the cattle business. My ancestors startedm aking a living in the 
cattlebusiness. My f ather
 
was still doing it during the Nazi tim e.
 
 
T he businesshad grown enorm ously because there weref ourm enandm y 
grandfather in thebusiness.T hey were doing ver y well
, v
er y, ver y well until January
 
1, 1937, 
when they got a postcard
 
--
 
I had a copy som ewhere. I can'tf ind it butI've seen it.T he copy of  

 
3
 
thepostcard gives notice that of thatdate they m ay not do any business any longer.
 
A  ye a r  
later, the same postcard, sam e sender, said ever ything they own now belongs to the state. So 
th a t wa s the  cata lyst.
 
They couldn't makea living anym ore.
 
 
My f ather was a very practical man.There were seven people in thehousehold he 
hadto support. Oneof  the reasons we were s till in Germany is thatalthough they were 

Orthodox Jews, they could notthinkabout going to
 
Palestinebecause there were no cattle 
businesses there.There were no cows.T here was no grass.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And that was their business.T hat's what they knew.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
T hey neededtom ake a living. Although they had money, they still needed to
 
m a k e a  livin g.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How big was your extended fam ily? 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Oh, huge. I have no way of knowin g. Yes, I have a genealogy. If  I study that, it 
would be sevenfeet, eight
-
f eet wide.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Aunts, uncles, cousins.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
M y grandm other cam ef rom  eight children. My grandfather cam ef rom f our orf ive 
children.Andmarriages and children, you know. M y f ather had som any cousins. Hedidn't 

think a second cousinwas a cousin.I think my second cousin is very valuable because I 
o n l y 
have one lef t.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Jill, besides losing your father
 
--
 
your f ather losing his business, when the 
Nazis cam e to power in 1933, in the years going up to Kristallnacht,m any, many restrictions 

were im posed. One ofthem was that you shared
 
--
 
that you sharedwith m e is that it was 
forbidden to keep kosher and yet your fam ily did its best to continuedoing that.T ellus a little 

about that.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
T here were a lotof  laws. T herewere la ws
 
--
 
it's in theexhibit next door where 
they had to give up their sil ver, their jewelr y. They didn'tdo that.T hey ga ve them  som e things 

but they didn't.T hey didn't obey the law of not having the kosher slaughtering. They did it
 
--
 
not 
in hiding
 
--
 
yeah, oneuncle did it in hiding. And the other onehad what do you call it, where 
you slaughter
 
--
 
it hasa nam e. It'safacility where cattleare slaughtered.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Right. Someone inthe audience will know that.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Since we  had such abig business, hehad one on hisproperty. He did kill
 
ca ttle . 
T hey refused not to eat meat.W hattodo?W hat to do?Thepeoplenext door were Nazis and 

they were ver y close. And they watched them  all the tim e. So he locked the inside door,had a 

m an with him ,of  course a righteous gentile who wouldn'ttalk, tiedup the anim al, didthe 

kosher slaughtering, and then he took a gunand shot him tohis head andthe neighbor heard 

the shot.T hat's the way they li ved.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you shared with m e that they would thenhide the knives that were used 
fo r th e 
rit u a l.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
T hose knives were hidden in our house. And we had two raids. Somebody gave 
them  away or tried to give them away. T hey raided the house. And the sm all onesfor the 

poultry, the special knives, were hidden in adrawer in the kitchen with the cutlery. And the big 

knives were the big cattle, m y uncle strappedto the inside of the chim ney.
 
 
So it wasn't like they went down notf ighting. T here were m any people thathad 
organized in our town, who were, I believe, Catholic, who were righteous
 
gentiles, who refused 
to letthis happen. Andthis was a double
-
edged sword.T hey were very good to us.T hey 
helped thefam ily and the business.T hey made sure we hadtoeat.And they said this is crazy, 

he's nuts, this is not going to continue, don'tpay
 
any attention to it.That's a double
-
edged 

 
4
 
sword. T hat gives you comfort. It's goodto hear but it can be destructive
 i
f  you're not, you 
know, tuned into reality.
 
SoonKristallnacht, all of that changed.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe get to that, just one or
 
two m ore questions. You were not yet in 
schoolat thattim e but your sister, Inge, who is four years older thanyou, what was her school 
experience like inthose early years?
 

>> J ill P a u ly:
 
W ell, she went to public schoolfirst. She was torm ented by the c
hildren. She hit 
back. She struck back. And it landed on aboy's noseand he hada bloody nose. And you 

would say good for her, right? But not so goodf or her because itf rightenedm y parents 

enough that they tookher out of the school.Andat 6 she was sentto live with m y grandmother 

in anothertown where there was am an
 
--
 
I wi sh I could speak of  him. He was anextraordinary 
m an. He was a teacher, a Hebrew schoolteacher. He ran a schoolhouse. He hadfour,f ive 

grades in one room. And that was education.
 
And she was a wiz of a student inboth Hebrew 
andGerman. She couldfit into any school pattern. Andthism an absolutely refused to believe 

thatanybody would capturehim or do him harm  because he didn't do anything elsebut teach 

children. He didn't do anything to save him self. And he died in the camp.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Jill, Kristallnacht, the night of Novem ber
 
9, 10, 1938, tell us what you 
rem em ber aboutthat night and what it meantfor you and yourf am ily.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
W ell, itmeant wake up. Them en were still at hom e. Itwas 9:00
 
in the morning.
 
My grandfather was the presidentof  the synagogue in our town for 30 years. They prayed in 

the synagogue twice a
 
day. It was only a block away. Som ebody knockedat thedoor. I was in 
the living room  with m y grandparents. I couldsee the doorbeing opened. My father was 

dressedto go to synagogue. Aman came to the door and said to him ," Don't goto the 

synagogue."  And he said, "Why?" he said,"Something terrible is going to happen. Don'tgo to 

the synagogue."
 
 
He didn't know anything. W e didn't know anything. Thatbecame very upsetting.T he 
m en were scream ing.T he brothers were scream ing. My grandf ather was in. My grandmother 

was listening, sitting in a chair inthe living roo m . I was sitting on a low chair. I think we wer e in 

therebecause it was Novemberand it was cold out and we had a little stove in that room  so 

we were keeping warm .
 
W hen sheheard them  scream ing andf ighting andthe phone started 
ringing, and m yf ather was tr ying to f ind out what was happen
ing, he found out over the phone. 

So she said, ok
 
--
 
herother son,m y uncle, wentoutside to closethe shudders.T hat was his 
wa y of  keeping the world out. And she said, "It's too latefor that.T hat's not going to help us."  

Ca ll u p  s o
-
an d
-
s o , t e llh im  to
 
pickus up, we're running away.
 
 
I don't know what shehad in herm ind, where to run to, but she was in charge. She 
was in control. She said we're all running away.
 
So the car cam eand picked up the 
grandparents and us, a non
-
Jewish driver. Andm y m other andfather were probably waiti ng for 
m y uncle with thef am ily car, a m ileaway. And m yf ather andall them en in thefam ily didn't 

show up in Cologne.W e drove into Cologne. They didn't show up.T hey had run into the 

woods. They drove into the woods,far into the woods.
 
 
W egotthere, itm ust have been dusk.W henwe were leaving the house, we smelled 
sm oke,m y sister andI, and we saw gra y stuff falling. It was the synagogue burning. It was 

11:00
 i
n the morning. W e were scream ing f rom  f right. So m y grandm ot
her putus in the car and 
put us with our f aces down on the f loor of  the car. The grandparents put their f eet on us. T hat 

seemedto quiet usdown.W e stopped crying and scream ing.
 
 
T he driver went.W hen we were just before Cologne, she let us getup. And I
 
rem em ber seeing theperiphery of  the city wit h many, many, m any f ires, big fires.W e wentinto 

 
5
 
Cologne and I remember I saw the Nazif lag. It was kind of  latealready. It was winter. Later. 
And I saw the Nazif lag for thef irst tim e. I thought it was ver y
 
p re tty.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You rem em ber seeing that.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Clearl y. T hey were big. I hadnever seen a Nazif lag. So it shows you how they 
kept the children. Never saw one.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As you said, youhad barely beenoutsidefor the several year
s.  
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Hardl y.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Your synagogue was burned and so were hundredsof  others throughout 
Germ any. Do you know if your parents realized thatthat nightof  attacks on Jews and Jewi sh 

businesses was occurring all over Germ any?Do you thin
k they had any idea?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yes, af ter thephone started ringing. Yes. That's whenthey learned. You know, 
Kristallnacht wasn'tannouncedonthe radio. It just happened.And the surprise
 
--
 
also, the 
thrust of Kristallnacht, the underlying
 
--
 
other
 
than the anti
-
Sem itism was stealing. If they could 
grab as muchas they could of  thepropertiesthatbelonged to the Jews
,  
it would be theirs. 
 
 
I readaboutthis once.It's very quite interesting. T he men came intoCologne the 
next day
 a
t  10 : 00
 
the next 
m orning, I think
. 
Goebbels called it off. And when he called itoff, he 
m eant no m ore
, n
o more rumm aging, stealing, attacking. They had doneenough and they had 
gotten enough.
 
 
Ok.T he men came into Colognefor the Sabbath.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Like your f ather
. 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
M y f ather. And the otherm en went somewhere else.And he decided over that 
weekend, Friday, that we were going to go into hiding in the attic.W here have you heard that 

bef ore? Andthank God, am illion tim esm y sister had a scream ing night
m are. And they 
realized it's not saf e; they had to leave. So three of them en,m y f ather, his brotherandf irst 

cousin, got into a car, our car,butnoperm ission and drove into Holland without perm ission. 

And they were caught.And they were im prisoned.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:
 
By the Dutch.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
By the Dutch.And there were m any Dutch Nazis. T hose borders were being 
controlled. 40,000 Jews ran into Holland during
 
--
 
aroundthat time.T hey had their own 
econom ic problem s.
 
 
W hen they were put inprison,m y m other's brotherand sister andher husband were 
living in Holland.T hey had lef t Germany in 1937 because the twomen were working f or the 

Berg brothersand thebusiness was closed.T hey hadno way of making a living, so they lef t 

and lived in Holland.
 
 M
y m other's brother was young. He was in his 20sat the tim e. He wasf luent in 
Dutch. Becausem y fam ily li ved alm ost on the Dutch border. My m other'sfamily. And we lived 

an hourf rom  the Dutch border, by car.T hey understood Dutch. He andm y aunt'shusband
 

saw them being transported to theprison so they followed them .And he asked them an, when 

he got there, the head of the prison
 
--
 
wh o  wa s  a  lit t le
 
--
 
really a Nazi
 
--
 
"W hatare you going to 
do with thesem en?"  He said
, ﬁ
I'm  sending them back to Germ any t
om orrow
.ﬂ
 
T hat'sall he had 
to hear. Andhe said to them ,tohim ," You know I know the
 
law. You're notallowed to send 
these menback to Germ any unless you have written perm issionf rom T he Hagueto do so."  He 

sa ys, "  
ﬁO
k. I'll ge t tha t 
perm ission by tom orrow m orning and then I'll send them back."  
 
 
Som y uncle got intouch with a very, ver y we ll
-
known Dutchm an, aJewish m an, 
who happened to be the court Jew. T wo queens
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Queen Juliana of the Netherlands.
 

 
6
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
She was not Nazi. He got perm ission to see her and got adocument signedby 
her to leave thesem en in a camp in Hollandbut they were not tobesendbackto Germ any.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So they were interned but not
 
--
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
But not in a concentration cam p. It wasn't ahappy camp but it wasn't a 
concentration cam p.They didn'tm ake them work, you know. On the contrary, they hadnothing 
to do, which can be very dif ficult also.
 
 
So they stayed in Holland. Andthe restof  thefam ily
 
--
 
one of the wom en that 
m arried into thefam ily also lived in Lechenich with her husband. Hewas not in thebusiness. 

He was m y f ather's cousin but he was not in the business. And shewas determ ined she was 

getting outof  Germ any with her little boy. Herhusbandactually wasn't thatf rightened.I d
on't 
know how he was not thatfrightened but he wasn't. He and hisbrother had been inW orldW ar 

I and they probably f elt that would help themnotbe
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As veterans of the Germ an Arm y.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yeah. T here was som ething in the beginning where he said the veterans wouldn't 
be sent to the camp, but you know that wasn't
 
--
 
he didn't hold to that.
 
 
Ok. So she cam ef rom a very hi ghly intellectually educatedf am ily, the woman. All 
her cousins were something
, r
eally something. And oneof them
 
was a chem ist studying 
chem istry in Munich. He heard Hitler speakon the streets while hewas in college andhewas 

determ ined thattheday af terhehashis certificate he was leaving Germ any. Andhe went to 

Englandand he started a chem istry f actory with
 
a f riend and he was successful. He had a 
sideline.And the sideline was helping Jews get out of Europe. So she called him and he was 

wi lling to try and help us. 
 

 
He had abrother who had been sent
 
--
 
who he brought out of Germany also to study 
law in England. And whenhe was em ployed
 
--
 
it was by a prestigio us law firm  in Nairobi, 
Kenya. Kenya was a British protectorate. And hehad the good luckof having som eone inhis 

off ice who was ver y looked uptoby the British governm ent. He was a Jewish man.Andh
e 

was able tohelp get perm issionfor usto com e intoKenya, contingenton many things. There 

were about 28 people signed up as fam ily to go to Kenya.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As allpart of your extendedfam ily to go toKenya,workin g through thef amily 
m em ber now
 
in England.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
I lef t something out.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 O k.  
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
M y grandm other, theone who was in control, sheforbade her sons and nephews 
to put onepenny intoGerm an banksaf ter Hitler came to power. And she carried
 
--
 
sh e wa s 
the 
bank. She carried it onher tumm y. I have her big tum m y. And we had the littlebag she 
carried it in.W e've lost it.W e've m oved toomany tim es.This manthat went to the queen had 

m et m y uncle in themountains on vacation and he told him  to get thef am ily
 
m oney out of 
Germ any. My grandm other thoughtthat was great. But they never sm uggled.T hey didn't know 

how to do that. It takes a talent.T hat was notoneof  their talents. But it was
 
--
 
he knew 
som ebody. He knew asm uggler who did thisfor a price. And the day I was bo
rn, the business 

m oney was sm uggled out.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Into T he Netherlands.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yes. And this man was sohonest. I think he was the caretakerof  this money the 
whole tim e that the men were incarcerated,for that whole year
 
--
 n
o, f rom
 
--
 
six years he 
m anaged that money.And he was sohonest, gave back every penny and losthis life.T hey 

m urdered him .

>> Bill Benson:
 
A n d ,  Jil l
,  
thatm oney was im portantfor lots of  reasons, including you had to 
pay for those visas that were going to allow you to get to Kenya. You neededmorethan 20 of  
them f or yourfam ily mem bers. Do you rem em ber whatthe costof  that was?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yes. It was 50 British pounds ahead.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In 1938
-`
39.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
It's about over
 
$1
 
m illio n  t o
day. And that money that they had brought into 
Holland,that served a purpose of saving people.T here were lots and lotsof  people who 

couldn't makedecisions like that.T hey were af raid to spend their money becausethey always 

felt they didn't know what was com ing next, they would need their m oney. I am  so eternally 

grateful that they were all abletom ake thisdecision to let go of them oney becauseevery one 

of  us wouldhave died.
 
 
So once themoney was in the banks in Holland
 
--
 
aboutf our years ago m y 
cousin, 
m y second cousin, Igon, called England. Hehadnever
 
--
 
he's an attorney. He hadnever seen 
anything 
wr i t
ten inhism other's home to verify what we know. So he called England. He called 
thedaughter of thism an who helped save usandasked her whether there were any 

docum entation between the Berg f am ily and her f ather. 
ﬁ
Oh ,
ﬂ  s he  
sa ys ,  
ﬁY
es, lots, but I have to 
have open
-
heart surgery so if  you callm eback in six m onths, I'll beable to help you.
ﬂ 
Su r e  
enough, six m onths later her son had gone to them useum  where they contributed his writings 

and gotten copies f or us. 
 
 
And we got them  aboutf our, f ive years ago. And we have theunderl ying 
docum entation to what happened.
 
T hef irst letter onthef ile that came out was a thank you 
letter signedby m y f ather and hisbrother and the cousin who were in the prisonfor nine 

m onthsand couldn'tmake any decisions, who weren't allowed to com municate.It allhadto be 

done outsideof  them .
 
 
And theuncle that I had in Holland,he wasf antastic. He was bright. 
The other uncle 
who was in Holland was not bright and quitedangerous,actually, because whathe wanted 

was f or thisman to get us all into Holland. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sofortunately thefam ily m aids thedecision you're all going to take advantage 
of  t he  op p
ortunity topurchase these visas and m ake your way to Kenya, which you did do in 

June of  1939. T ell us what it took
 
--
 
because your f atherand your uncles are im prisoned in 
Holland.So it's yourmother, your grandm others, aunts. How did they m anage to pull
 
th at off, 
to get you outof  Germany? 
 

>> J ill P a u ly:
 
T he way I pulled off getting m yself at83packed andmoving to New York.W ho 
kn o ws?  

>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Ok. One of the things, of course, your money was in Holland but the Nazis 
were not allo
w
ed
 
--
 
rem em ber, this isbefore the war formally began in Septem ber
 
1939. It's 
about to happen.But you were not allowed to takeany m oney out of the country but you could 

purchase goods while you were in Germ any.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Oh, yes. Ever ybody's so amazed about that. But therewas a m ethod totheir 
m adness.T he peoplewho had perm ission to leave Germany couldspend all of their m oney 

buying Germ an stuff. Hitler had no problem with that
, a
s long asthey could steal it off thepiers 
once it was packed.
 
 A  
lot of people got stuff out.T hey had spentafortune
 
--
 
there were several issues 
there. You were going to Af rica.W ho went toAf rica in 1939, 1939?T here were no ref rigerators 

no cars,noovens, noutensils.There was nothing. Sothey bought it all. And
 
m y m other had us 

 
8
 
outf ittedfor eight years in clothing. And som eof  it arrived but mostof it went somewhere else.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
It waspacked and shipped and you never saw it again.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ri ght. Stuff  did arrive, enough to manageon.
 
 
W hen we  
got toKenya, we saw m y f ather. I picked him  outof  a m illion people 
because he was weari ng his European suit, a white shirt and ahat.T hat's not the way them en 
in Kenya dressed.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe get to you getting to Kenya, tell usaboutyour journey to get to 
Kenya.W ith this large numberfam ily m em bers, you had grandparents, at leastone 

grandparent who was ver y ill but you som ehow m anaged to geteverybody together and out of  

Germ any.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
It was horrible. It was ninem onths living in Cologne. There werefive
 
--
 
I th o ugh t 
they were old people.They were in their 50sandearly 60s.W e lived in an apartm ent.T hey 

were m y m other'saunts and uncles.T here was m y mother and the two children. And there 

was other people.T heapartment was just awful.T hey didn't have enough money f orfood. 

T hey were af raidto go on the streets.And Ihad a very sick grandmother in that apartm ent. 

Shehad cancer. And she was on 
m orphine.
 
Jews weren't allowed to go to non
-
Jewish doctors. 
So they hada connection there.Itm ust havebeen a Jewish doctorwho was able to gether 

the painkiller. 
My other grandparents were not with us. 
 
 
I wasn't always good there.
 
I tried. I hada little school
ma t e , a  lit t le girl.  My f irs t  
playm ate. I wasn't allowed to play with otherchildren ever. Because they were af raid we would 

talk. I wasn't allowed to play with non
-
Jewish children,that was a given. ButI didn't have any 
Jewish children toplay with either. So this little girl and Ihad a ballfor those eightm onths.W e 

enjoye
d eachother tremendously.
 
 
My grandm other
 
--
 
they used to leave us with the grandmother andwent to do what 
they had todo. I don't know what they were doing, papers, shopping. And she was with m e. So 

I kindof  got close to that grandm other during thatha
rs h  t i me .
 
T he people we were li vin g with 
were her brother and sisters. They had retired f rom another town and moved into Cologne. 

You know, I've never spoken about this.Thiscam ef rom  a little town where he was so 

we l l
-
respectedand liked that they m adehim King of  the Carnival, the annual carnival. Andthat 
town becam e vi
rulent
ly anti
-
Sem itic so they had to get out.And he being a very Orthodox m an, 
he was worried aboutour losing our identity.So he went out andbought [Indiscernible]. And 

them an, two men, carried thatouton the lastboat and it gotto Kenya.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you had it with you in Kenya. T ellus where it isnow.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
No w it's at the synagogue inSilver Spring, Mar yland.My sister and I inherited it. 
W ebrought itto the states. It went dormant. You couldn't use it because the letters were 

rubbing out.W ehad it restored. And then wedonated it to the synagogue. So it's still living.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you
 
--
 
on thatdate, June
 
9, 1939,thef am ily lef t Germ any. You went by 
t
rain, ended up inGenoa, Italy. Andf rom there you boarded a ship.T ell us about the trip.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Oh .
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
You know, it started on the train. Beforethe trainm y m other decided that I was 
no longer a child, so she sat me down and she toldm e that what we were doing was 

lif e
-
threatening and very dangerous and that Ihadto learn how to behave once we got on the 
tra in . 
 
 
Getting on the train was noteasy either becausem y grandm other had to be carried 
andthey had no usef or sick people thathad to be carried.But wef oundam an, a relative of a 

 
9
 
relative, who had just com e out of Dachau. He was in Dachauf oram onth.I remem ber what 
he looked like. Oh, God. And he carried her into the car and into the train. Andthen they didn'
t 
see that she couldn'tm ove or anything. They lef t her alone. 
 
 
W e were very good on thetrain.W e were scared. Iunderstood whatit m eant to be 
separated.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Because, again, your father is still away.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ri ght. He was already gone. But I was af raid of being separatedf rom m y mother. 
So we sat inthe com partm ent without speaking to eachother.W e just sat there.
 
 
Not long ago I calledmy sister and I said," Ihave a memory. Did the Nazis come into 
our com partm entand look at our passports?" She said," Not once, twice. Your m em ory is 

right."  And they walked out again. 
 
 
Once we got
 
--
 
aboutthree, three and a half hours,m y m other sm iled. I had never, 
ever seen that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Once she was out of Germany, f elt saf e.
 
>> J ill P a u
l y:
 
T he sm ile I'll neverf orget.Butwe weren't quite thereyet. So when we got to Italy, 
it was hot, steam y.W e didn'thave any m oney. Ever y Je w that lef tGerm any was entitled to 

what we call today
 
$10. And there were 12 ofus. And we had to stay somewhere over the 
Sabbath.
 
 
My grandfather was ve ry Orthodox. He didn'tm ake it easy. AndasOrthodox as he 
was and aseducatedhe was in Judaism, there was one aspect of  Judaism  thathe didn't 

re a lize
 
--
 
didn't quite connect with. If  your lif eis in danger, the
 
rules of  the T orah do not apply. 
You candoanything.You caneatanything and you can do anything to save your lif e. He 

wouldn't eat on the ship unless he had kosher food. And if hedidn'tget kosherfood, he wasn't 

going on the ship. [Laughter] It wasf
unny. Som ebody called Berlin, one of the aunts, out of 
desperation called som e organization in Berlin and they delivered kosherfoodf or thefam ily f or 

the ship.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And the real kicker here,of  course, is it was a Nazi ship.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
A N
a zi s h ip .
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Because you were only allowed to take a Nazi ship.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ri ght. But this ism y grandfather. And he was walking a roundonthe ship with his 
caneand white shirt. You would have thought he was PrinceEdward. He was 79 years old. 

And we were forever grateful that he was sopositive, you know. He couldhave made it harder.
 
 
Once I got on thism iserable ship, m y motherhad suchaf it. She gotso angry. All 
the Jews were sent lower deck and were not allowed to go on an upper deck.And the rest
 
--
 
thehum an beings wer e on the upperdeck.She gotfurious. 
 
 
She rebelled quite a bit thereonthat ship.
 
W e had to go in to eat in the dining room 
but we couldn't takeIgon with us, the little boy. He had to befed separately when the adults 

were out of the dining room. Every tim e he went in to eathepeed onthef loor. T he diapers in 

those days were not what they are today. And m y aunt wanted to get on the f loor and clean it 

up andm y m other said, " Over m y dead body.T hey are treating us like animals, you'renot 

going to clean it up.
ﬂ 
She wouldn't let her.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Tell us about
 
--
 
basically sounded like a comm andperform ancetohave you 
com e and sing bef orethe ship's captain.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yes. I realize now, af ter
 
m any ye ars, what was wrong with me was I was sun 
deprived. I was not letout in the sunshinef orsix years. I was not letout, hardly ever. Only 

 
10
 
when I was [Indiscernible] andnotf or a long tim e.
 
 
I started singing.W hen I was happy
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
On
 
the ship.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
W hen I was happy, I was singing. In CologneI was not singing. T hat's not true.
 
One of  m y uncles taught m e Haggadah f or 
Passover. All the music, I was singing the whole 
thing. And that was just af ter Passover. So I'm  sitting there
 
singing som e of these songs to 
m yself .And I was overheard. And the next thing you know, m y m other was called in to the 

captain. She was shivering f romf right. She didn't know what it was about. Because she knew 

we were being good because we understood.W ould she give perm ission f orm e to sing for his 

crew? She couldn't say no. She was af raid. 
 
 
So ok.T hen she worri ed aboutm y singing H ebrew songs. The Haggadah was in 
Hebrew. Beautifulm usic, by the way. M y uncle,m y great uncle, sang at the opera.So 

go r
geous. That's why I was singing it.
 
She said yes, ok. But 
t h en
 
she decided I needed not to 
sing the songsf rom the Haggadah.And they toldm e.I don't know how m uch of it I 

understood. Butm y gr andm other, who taught m e am illionf olk songs, because I was a
l wa y s  

singing, she said," Sing the songs that you sing with m e."
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
German f olk songs.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yes. And I musthave done well because nothing came back to us. And they 
askedm e to sing every night f or two weeksfor the wholetrip. And I
 
only rem em ber one. Idon't 
rem em ber singing f orthem every night. But the lady who is still li vin g, 99
 
1/2, when she was of  
full m ind she said " You sang every night."
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
S o , J ill
 
--
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
T he Germ ans, Nazis
,  
love m usic.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:
 
They wanted to hear those folk
 so n gs. 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You make the trip. It'sa longjourney to East Af rica.You m ake it to Kenya, 
arrive in Kenya. And yourfatherand uncles, they've gotten there aheadof you.So they're 

there for y
ou.
 
 
So now you're in Kenya, an entirely differentworld, an entirely diff erent culture.One 
of  the things I'd like you totalk aboutf irst,before we turn to that, is it's a British protectorate, as 

you said, the British run it.T hey declared you as enem y
 
aliens.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Not right away because the war hadn't brokenup.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 O k.  
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
W hen we f irst got there, m y father had thef reedom  togo around and lookf or 
farm s.And believe itor not, m yf ather was af raid of wild anim als. Here he was in Kenya.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
And he loved animals.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A cattle man.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
But he sure knew what they would do if they got aholdof  him . Hedidunderstand 
th a t.
 
 
So som e English people, Idon't know who, took them a
round looking at f arm s. T hey 
boughtafarm .W efirst went to live in a big house in Nairobi, everybody together inone house. 

My sister and I hadtostart school the day af ter we got therebecause m y parents were totally 

hysterical about our not getting educated.I didn't think it was aproblem .
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
It's true. I really rem ember those feelings
. W
hat arethey so hysterical about?
 

 
11
 
Anyway, the custom  was that theblackm en,the youngm en who workedfor thef am ily
,  
would 
wa lk u s t o  sch o
ol, carry our lunch boxes, and pick usup.And m y motherhad toadjust. She 
wanted us goto school, she had to adjust. Soshe hadexactly 24 hours to adjust.
 
 
I remember thef irstday of school.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
This was an English school.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
En
glish. I didn'tunderstand a thing. ButI did cry because when I came home, I 
hadbeen told,f irst weekend, thatI had to learn how to sing " GodSave the King"  and Ihad to 
know the poem  "The Daff odils"  byW adsworth. I cam e hom e and cried bitterly. My 

gr a n
dm other said," Don't cry, child.W e'll learn it. You'll know it."  She didn't know a word of 
E n glis h .
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Som ething
 
--
 
I don't know what happenedon Monday,but I don't rem em ber that. 
But what was im portant aboutthat walking to thehouse, to school and back, they taught us 

S wa h ili.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you were learning English andSwahili.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
At the sam etim e. And we were bothf luent within three m onths.T here was some 
pressureon usf or the English butthe Swahili there
 
was no pressure but we learned it easily. 
And I think one of the reasons was becausewe loved those people.W e were very
 
--
 
who the 
hell was nice tous,anyway? T hese people were goodtous. And so we bonded very quickl y.
 
 
T hen something happened. I can't
 
tell you the exact truthaboutthisbecause I have 
a disconnect. Idon't know if  they bought thefarm  bef ore the war broke out but we weren't 

living on thefarm but I think they had put down the money and they had gone to settlem ent 

and we hadn't movedyet from thehouse when the war brokeout.Because I remember a little 

black man com ing to the house and pickingup all them en to put them  in a camp.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Once the war began.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Once the war began, all German nationals in Kenya were put ina cam p.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Including Germ an Jews who escaped.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
W ho were running away from the Nazis. Right. T hey didn't know that.
 
I f ound that 
out in thism useum  50years later. The reason they picked up the Jews is becausethe Nazis 

we r e
 
stealing Jewish i dentities and going into allied countries. So they had to be very, ver y 
caref ul.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For spying purposes?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ye s .
 
 
So all them en in thefam ily went toa cam p. And they wanted to take m y 
grandfather. So m y grandmother said, 
ﬁF
ine, you can takehim but you have to takem e with 
him ; I'm his caretaker.
ﬂ ﬁ
No, you can't go.
ﬂ 
S he  sa ys,  
ﬁW
ell, then you can'ttake him.
ﬂ 
A nd  t he y 
didn't take him.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
So therewe were in Nairobi. Oh, then
 
--
 
som ebody
 
wor kedfor them  with the 
governm ent, spoke tothe people in Nairobi, and said that we had already purchased thef arm  

and would they give perm issionfor them to go
?  
People whohad where to go they let out. 
People they could supervise they would letout. So
 
they let them allgo back go to thefarm . It 
only took a week. Andwe were all interned as enem y aliens.Thatmeans we could not leave 

thefarm  without perm ission. Andall of  lif e was in Nairobi. My sister and I had to go back and 

forth all thetime but I
 
don't thinkm y father needed perm issionfor us becausethey knew where 
we were.
 

 
12
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To go to school.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
And when they neededperm ission, they had tohave a blackfellow with a bicycle 
to go very f ar away and bring backthe perm ission slips. It took tim e. But f orf ive years during 
the war, especially the m en, were interned, couldn't leave without perm ission.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And wi th m ost of  the British
 
--
 
m any of them were off obviously f ighting in the 
war. So folks like yourfather and your uncleswere f orced to manage otherf arm s.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
T hey had to do
 
--
 
what do you call it?T hey had to be supportive during the war. 
So instead of managing their own farm s, in addition they had to each take oneotherfarm in 

the area.
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:
 
During thattim e, during thosewar years that you were in Kenya, do you know 
if  yourf am ily m em bers, parents andotherf am ily m embers, adults,did they have any contact 

with thef am ily that were still in Germ any? And didthey have any tense of what was happening 

to Jews in Europeor to any degree?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
No.W e did have contact until,Iwould say, the last
 
--
 `
40, 
`
41. T hey had 
absolutely no idea at all but they knew it wasn't good.It was a terrible war. T hey f igured they 

m ight have been bombed and killed. But they didn't know anything about the ghettos.T hey 

didn't know anything about
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Deathcam ps or anything like that?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
No. No. They started learning ina very strange way. Before they started looking 
fo r th e
irfam ily m em bers, there were m en in Kenya, Jewish m en, who had com e to scout out 
the country and had left theirfam iliesbehind in Europeand were going to bring them over and 

got caught.Thefam ilies were in Europe and they were in Kenya.T hey got information right 

away that theirf am ilies didn't survi ve. Andthese men wanted to remarry. And there was an 

inf lux of young wom enwho wanted tom arry that camef rom  Europe, to Kenya. Notmany.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Postwar.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Postwar. Not many. And they started realizing that
 
there was som ething not quite 
right about thesepeople. And they started talking. And they started telling their stories. It was 

te rrib le . Itto o k the m
 
--
 
they never really adjusted to what happened to their fam ily m em bers.
 
 
I know when we lef t Nairobi, we had many f riends who when
 
--
 
who came to see us 
off . Oneof  them en gave m y father an album of  photographs of people in the camps. T hey 

looked at it. My f atherstartedto cry. My m other started to cry. T heyclosed it. SoI wanted to
 

see what was in the album. And they said,no, under no condition was I to look at it. But I 

wanted to see what was in the album. I gotaholdof  thealbum . And I openedup and looked at 

it. I was 13.And som ething built up inm e, Idon't know. I became a different Jew. I was so 

angry at thesepictures. My m othernoticed that there was som ething going on with m e with 

these pictures. She took thealbum ,threw it overboard. She couldn't take it. You couldn't 

identif y anyone. It wasawf ul.
 
 
In  scho o l I suffe re
d quite abit inKenya.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A lot of anti
-
S em it ism ?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
A  lo t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
By the British.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
By the British. But particularly f or m e there was a girl who startedharassingme 
when I was 6, 7 yearsold. Som uch so that whenm y sister picked me up af ter school, we'd 

m eet after school to go to where we were li vin g, I was cr ying, ever y d ay. She said,"W hat's 

going on?" She said, " I know what theproblem  is. It's your nam e, Gisela. W e're going tohave 

to change that. From this day on you're going to be Jill." And it worked. 
 

 
13
 
 
It helped a lot, except for one girl. Unf ortunately she was in m y class throughout the 
school.I could not understand how this little girl could be soanti
-
Sem itic where she learned 
anything about Jews. Iwas the only Jewish child in the school, inthelower school. And she 
called m e "
d
irty Jew"  or whatever Jew, and itstartedtom akem e very angr y. And this went on 
all the way through until I would say what you call hereeighth grade. Andthe last two 
years, 

seventh andeighth grade inKenya you hadto dodouble
-
duty sports. During the schoolday 
andthree days a week after school. And I loved it.I bicycled back to school. I played hockey, 

f ield hockey. And she played f ield hockey.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> B i l
l Benson:
 
I thinkwe see what's coming. Don't we? 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
And shehadanopportunity to hit m e, to bang m e on my shin. Oh, I could stillfeel 
thepain. Terribly painful. I let that hockey stick
 
--
 
I wouldn't hither wi th the hockey stick. Hit her 
w
ith m y hands. I beat the crap out of her.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
She juststood there. She was as white as snow. Herface
 
--
 
she was horrif ied. I 
m ean, shehad saidthese things
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For years.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Verbal abuse I could handle. Physical abuse, oh, gosh did I let her have it.
 
And I also knew that we were going to America. So Ihadthis littlebit of a push behindm e.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You knew you were about to leave.
 
 
Of course, they endedup then moving to theUnited States. Leaving in part because 
of  turm oil inKenya with the uprising that was taking place in 1947.You came to the United 

States, again, a whole new culture, whole new lif e. 
 
 
W edon't have tim e to talk aboutthat.
 
Ithink we have tim e for one ortwo questions 
andthen we're going to closeour program . Let's see if  anybody has a question.
 
 
W e have m icrophones.W e ask if  you have a question, please use the microphone. 
I'll repeat the question. Make it as brief as you can. I'll repeat it just to make sure that we all 

hear itand then Jill will respond to it.
 
I think we have tim efor a couple.
 
 
And letm ealsom ention that Jill will rem ain on stageaf ter wef inish, so, please, 
absolutely f eelf ree to com e on up on the stage af terwards, meet Jill, get your picture taken 

with her, ask her a question. I'm  sure she will tell you a lot more.
 
 
All right.W ehave a question, one back hereandone right hereI think. Ok.Let me 
get you them ic, if  you don'tm ind. It's com ingto you now. 
 

 
T hank you. 
 
>>
 
F i rs t  o f  
all,thank you very m uch. I've appreciated this. I would like to know
 
--
 
you said that 
your f am ily went backfor several hundred years that youhave beenable tofind. Youhavea 

rather large number ofyou got to go to Af rica. How m any of  yourf am ily in Europe got
 
--
 
wa s  
able
 
--
 
other people ofyour f am ily that you know of  was able to get out? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How m any m em bersof  your family that weren't withyou got out?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Oh, since it was such a hugefam ily, I know of two of m y f ather's cousins. One 
went to Chile,anotherone wentto Majorca, Ithink,and then wef ound a second cousin. Oh, 

andm y father didhave one wom an, one relative who came to the United States before 

Kristallnacht. And they comm unicated sparingly during the war. M y father
 
had enough 
information to f ind her
a
f ter the war. And there was a great relationship, extraordinary 
relationship.

W ehave a question right down here.
 
>>
 
T hank you som uch. I've appreciated what you toldus all today.My question is,af ew 
m inutes ago you spoke of this little girl who became your bestf riend, your only f riend you had
 
a
nd youplayed with her for a numberof m onths or years. Did you ever keep in touch with her? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The little girl that was your playm ate, did you keep in touch with her, Jill?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
I couldn't. Becauseherm other told m y mother
 
--
 
we left in June.In April th
e 
m other toldm y m other that she'staking the child tofollow her husband who was somewhere 

along the border with Czechoslovakia
. W h
atI do know? I didn'tunderstand all of that.And she 
left. Didn't survive.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
One more question. Rem em ber, we'll have you come up on stage afterwards. 
Onem ore question. Right there.
 
 
And we have a young person backthere. You want to come up onstage and ask 
your question afterwards? Ok.
 
>>
 
T hank you som uch for your talk this morning. Have you ever been back to
 
your hometown 
or to Cologne?
 

>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Ye s .
 
>>
 
Have you been able tof ind your place where you grew up and whatever?
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yes, yes I have. I come back allthe tim e with the sam e reaction. I'm  as cold as 
ic e .
 
In fa ct, I spo ke th ere . I wa s in
vited to come back because they were all so curioushow we 
m anaged to survive. And the last generationwouldn't tell them. So I told them .They were ver y 

nice. And I had a question f rom  a young girl of about16.She said, "Don't you ever get 

homesick?" "W ouldn'tyou like to com e backand live here?" It was a very hard question but I 

was ver y direct. I told her I had no connectionwhatsoever. Our rootswere cut and planted in 

the UnitedStates andthat I was so gratef ulfor that, that I couldnever consider 
l ea vi n g.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'm going to turn back to Jill in a coupleof m om entsbecause it'sour tradition at
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
that our First Personhasthe lastword. And then when Jill closes theprogram 
again, please,absolutely com e up if  you would like to and askher a question or talk to herand 

get your picture takenwith her.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being with us. I rem ind you we will have
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program s eachW ednesday andThursday until them iddle of August. I hope you can return 

another 
tim eor next year.W e'll resume againin March 2018.
 
 
W ith that, Jill? 
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
Yeah.W ith justafew days pastMem orial Day this year, I've taken a long walk on 
Mem orial Day and cam ebackand decided to watch TV. I saw thatthere was aprogram  on, 
on  

W orldW ar II. It was three hours. It was excellent.In theend they showed the picturesof  the 

cem eteries of the Am erican soldiers inthis Europe. My husband and I had been to the ones 

outside Luxem bourg in the 1990s.W etook atrip and stopped inLuxem
bo u r g.  A nd  th e ef fect 
those cem eteries had on m e
 
--
 
I was a very li ttle girl on thef arm  inKenya when m y parents 
decided they hadtoopen a second incom ebecause they had to pay f or oureducation which 

couldn't com eoutof the farm . So they opened abed and breakf ast.T hey were terrif ic cooks 

andthey were ver y social. For three,four years, soldiers usedto com efor R&R to ourf arm . 

T hey loved m y parents. They loved thef ood.W ehad tohave a quorum for saying prayers. 

T hey cam e with driver s. They were hi
gh
-
ranking, som e of them . They had drivers. And the 

 
15
 
drivers weren't Jewish but that didn't bother anybody. T hey justf it right in, into the program . 
T hey were wonderf ul m en. 
 

 A
nd then
 
--
 
I think in1943, one after one was senttof ightand not asingle one came 
back. It was so devastating tom eas a child.And whenI saw thesecem eteries with all of these 

crosses and Jewish stars, they cam eupagain on thisf ilm  and I thought, 
H
ow deeply do we 
feel? Do people go back to these cem eteries? Do they visit their ancestors whof ought in the 

war? It wasn't a one
-
sided war. You know, murdering the Jews was a separate war f rom W orld 
W ar II. Many, many, many otherpeople,60
 
million people were killed. 
 
 
Are there any people in the audience thatare descendantsof W orldW ar II soldiers 
thatdidn't make it? One? 
 
 
Yes. You see?W e think about iton Mem orialDay but it's such abig thing really. 
How m any soldiers died? How m any Am ericans died? Never m ind the otherpeople.250,000? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Hundreds of thousands.
 
>> J ill P a u ly:
 
And if you ever go to Europe and you get an opportunity, go to those cem eteries. 
T hey're extraordinary. They're kept beautif ully.
 
 
W ith that I'm closing today.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you, Jill.
