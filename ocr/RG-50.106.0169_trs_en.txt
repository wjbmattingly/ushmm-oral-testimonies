mak e th e 
[indeciphera ble]
 of it, and they -- they 
took us to that place, 
Lienzingen
.  
Q: And please describe 
Lienzingen
 to me. 
A: 
Lienzingen
 was the first camp , and we worked, 
they took us several kil-kilomers, 
we had to walk to a place, a zoological ga
rden. There was no animals, we were the 
animals actually, and we dug 
ditches. They  measured up so many -- so many feet th-
the lengths, so many feet the widths, and so 
many feet the depth. And you have to do it 
through -- through th e day. Da
y in and day out, the same 
thing, may -- we dug those 
di-ditches. And it was terrible, 
very, very bad. And they  told
 us, this is the last week, 
and we going to go to anot
her place, going to be much nicer, the food will be better, 
everything will be better, and th
e -- we™re going to go -- they
™re going to ship us to 
Germany. 
And I didn™t like it, to go 
Germany
, I didn™t like it at all. So I didn™t tell 
anybody in the camp, 
my friends, that I mad e up my mind I™m not going to go, I going 
to escape. Well, I mean -- and so -- 
Q: Um, before we get to that, let™s talk a 
little bit more about the 
co nditions in -- in 
Lienzingen
. Did you sleep in a barracks? 
A: Yeah, there was -- there wasn™t a barr
acks yet, and it was like a -- like a -- like 
herrings, one on top, next to each other, th -the bunks, like, you know? And the -- and I 
mean, it was -- was very bad. 
And that™s frightened, mo re than anything else, to go to  
Germany
. I figure, well I was born in 
Poland
, I might as well die there, I don™t want 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski

18
to go to 
Germany
. And th-they told us, this is the 
last w eek, and we™re going to go 
away to 
Germany
. I did make up my  mind, I™m not going to go. And I did escape 
from the -- from the place I was 
w o rking, and they
 knew right away that I escape, 
because you have to line up 
for a roll call, an d they were
 looking for me, I no -- I knew 
that. And I took a chance, a big chance. I th
ink my  mind didn't  work right, if anybody 
with -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape. And the reason for that is, 
some of them did escape, but 
they caught them in no time. 
And th  -- when  they caught 
them in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thur
sday, or whatever day 
was, they put them 
-- th-they brought them back 
to their camp to wh-where 
he escaped, and Sunday they 
brought them out on roll call, everybody wa
s there lined up. They
 brought them up, 
they brought a portable gallow, and he was 
hanged. So I knew what
™s going to happen 
when -- when they catch me
. But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I 
didn™t think about that, and I was lucky, ve
ry  extremely lucky they  didn™t catch me. So 
I went from pillar to post, like the saying go
es, knock on the door, 
beg for a piece of 
bread. Some -- some w o men, some people offe
red to give me a piece of bread, others 
slammed the door in my face. Get -- get th
e hell out of here, dirty Jew. They knew 
right -- right away I was Jewish. So after 
awhile, if I had some
body with me, I would 
probably  wind out in th e -- in
 the forest, but by myself 
didn™t know where to go, how 
to go. So, I was -- and I knew at the college, 
there was -- there were Jews there, and 
there was a ghetto there, I knew that. So to
ok me days, weeks, maybe several months,

little by little I got into th
e city, to college, and little kids were playing 
[indecipherable]
 ball there, and I went and talked 
to them, and I said, I understand the 
Jews live here, they call it the ghetto or so
mething, can you sh ow me where it is? So 
one boy is pulling on the other, 
don™t talk to him, th-the 
-- it™s prohibit and you can™t 
go th ere. You cannot go there, and the onl
y -- the one of them said come, I™ll show 
you. He went with me and from a distance 
I saw already th-th-the fence, you know. 
And -- and I went there, and -- and I was walk
ing close by. And there was a gate there, 
the gate was open, th e chain was hanging 
down, and the Germans, the Nazis were 
going back and fo rth. One was 
going this way, the other one was going this way, and 
they meet. And the -- and the gate was open 
[indecipherable]
 do wn , wh en  
there™s s -- 
when  they  start talking, I crossed over and I smuggle my self in. They luckily didn™t 
notice me. But who noticed me? T h e Jewish 
police. Wh-What th -- 
they have a black 
unifo rm with the nightstick, and armb and, 
dai
 
politsi
, police, and that™s all they had. 
So they  grabbed me, and th ey start talking in
 Polish to me, what ri
ght do you have to -- 
to smuggle yourself into the gh
etto, in Polish. I says -- and 
I talk back in Yiddish. And 
they couldn™t believe, because oh, the kidwas born probably amongst the Jews there, 

th-the -- ye -- you know, with Jew -- where a 
lot of Jewish live, and he picked up some 
Jewish, he is not Jewish. And I tried to ta
lk to him, I™m Jewish, I™m Jewish, no, no. 

They took me in a room there and I said, I 
can tell you I™m Jewish because there come 

a transport from 
Kalish 
and there were some  -- a couple of doctors there. Dr.

was one of them. Then another one, but I 
couldn™t -- I couldn™t remember the other 
one, and they said to me 
[indecipherable]
 saying th e other, well the kid is talking 
sense because they shipped ou
t some people with the Dr. 
Cohen
, somebody else, 
anyway. So they said, okay, wh at is 
your name? They wrote down  the letters
 Fievish 
Nicinski
 and then th ey wrote in big 
letters too, your name is 
Bahardian Elias,
 born 
[indecipherable]
. And I was the age -- they make th
e age like 27 years old. So -- so 
we g -- we going to  check with you. We
 not tell you when , tomo rrow, next day, 
whatever it is. You™re not going to  take out 
a piece of paper, you have to memo rize the 
name in where was you -- where was 
you born. So I recognized that 
[indecipherable]
 
that I had tried to memorize all this, and they
 took me in next day, wh at is your name? 
So I have to tell them 
Bahardian [indecipherable]
 this and that. And th en I learned 
from the others, that the guy like this esca
ped. They  didn™t notify the -- the German 
authority, so they go
t a special ration of whatever 
the -- you know, bread and milk, 
whatever it was. They didn™t -- they didn™t tell the German 
that he escaped. So I took 
his name. And so from there, one fi
ne night they circled the ghetto, 
raus, raus, raus, 
out, out, out. And they took
 us to another ghetto, 
Lódz. Lithmanstadt. 
They call it 
Lódz, Lódz
 ghetto. There I was, and I worked ther
e, I worked there hard. There was a 
-- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, 
SS
, Gestapo uniforms. And th ey told  me, 
you have to be extremely, extremely carefu
l. Don™t let any spot come out and make 
holes in it, because that™s 
very dangerous. You -- you pa
y a big penalty for that. The

irons weren™t like it is here, electric. They we

 did escape, but they didn™t go too far. They 
caught them 
[indecipherable]
 th-they looked obvious, with
 the dogs, they had the -- 
they sniffed them out. I was ju
st extremely lucky. And then
, what™s happened is that 
w h en  th ey  b r oug h t  th em in , 
like I told you, they
 -- they -- they 
-- on Sunday they 
brought them up and they -- they  hanged th
em -- not only this, we were watching it, 
standing there in the roll call, you have to 
watch exactly, not look 
away one way or the 
other, left or right. They  point out, if 
you lo ok away, you™ll be next. If you look one 
way or the other way, left or
 right. You had to look strai
ght ahead, and they  have a 
speech there. This is -- this 
is the -- th-the verdict for -- 
for e-escaping. That™s how far 
you can go. This is it. You tr
y to escape and that™s what -- 
that what™s going to happen 
to you. Then  they put the f
ear o-over you, you know. But 
I did it, I -- I don™t know, it -
- it was difficult, but I da -- I didn™t know what to do. Once I did I regret anyway 
because -- because I -- I -- I wa
s talking to myself I shou
 -- maybe I should go back. 
And if I do go back, I™ll be lu
cky enough to  get in, they kn
ow I -- they knew already I 
was missing, so this certain death, that
™s for sure. So I couldn™t go back in.

deciding to take this
 incredible chance? I 
mean, that took a lot of inner strength. 
H-Ho -- wh-what do you attribute that to? 
A: I can™t exactly explain that. I don™t think I 
had a brain, if I did have, it™s all blocked. 
I bra -- I didn™t -- I didn™t see the danger, so
mehow. I just was thinking I didn™t want to 
go to 
Germ any

Q: Did you tell anybody you were going to  do it? 
A: Never said a word  to anybo

wouldn™t understand. And we 
could hear a little bit that 
they bomb above us. And was 
all over, 
raus, raus

 were disappointed. Were so 
disappointed maybe next time God will help
, it™ll penetrate and -- and we™ll all get 
killed, because it was miserable, we couldn
™t take it no more. Well, another time came 
and was the same thing, and we were disappoin
ted. And finally they say, well, this is

that time. We were disappointed .

A: They didn™t tell us. They  just move me 
-- or moved us, we were leaving, and th e 
place was 
Buchen wald
. It wasn™t too far from 
Dora
. The outskirts of 
Dora
, not too 
far, actually. 

Q: And when you got th
ere, what did you see? 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski

A: In
 Buchenwald
? We saw misery. In 
Buchenwa ld
 it was -- it was a big camp, it 
was over 80,000 people there. There 
were boys and girls there, in 
Buchenwald
. That 
was a huge camp.  
Q: And where did they put you? 
A: In barracks, like those -- those bunks, 
you know, like -- like sa
rdines, one next to 
another. And it was -- it wasn™t very pleasant 
at all. The worst of all was the lice. You 
have so much lice they eat you up alive. Yo
u scratch and they nest there, and you 
scratch mo re. You couldn™t ask -- you couldn™t
 tell a doctor or anybody like this that 
you got hurt, or hurt you or 
something. You di -- can™t 
open your mouth and saying 
anything like that. Once you say yo
u si -- you sick, you™re going.  
Q: Did you -- wa -- wer-were there lice in
 the other places that you had been? 
A: All of them, plenty. Sund
ay we took out the blanke
t, put them in the snow, 
wintertime. You picked them out, there was 
a perfect square, all dark, with hundreds 
and thousands pounds of lice. But the couple
, two or three days after, they come back, 
because they -- they 
-- there -- there was some eggs s
till there, and they -- you know, 
they -- they want a body, 
they come back. Oh yes. 
Q: So you never went to 
s -- a so-called infirmary? 
A: No. 
Q: A-And you said you had lice on your body? 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski  
 
March 6, 2007 
 

 
 
53
A: Yes, everywhere. Whole clothes, everythi
ng was soaked with sa
 -- with the -- with 
lice. They eat you up aliv
e, they really did. 
Q: What kind of wo
rk did you do in 
Buch enwald,
 or did you do any wo rk? 
A: In 
Buchenwald
 didn™t do anything. I don™t reme mb er doing anything in 
Buchen wald . 
Q: So you ju st sat, during th e day? 
A: Do -- doing nothing, just sit there and 
do nothing. I didn™t do an ything, I don™t 
remember that. 

Q: And again, what were your thoughts 
wh en you would see German soldiers? What 
thoughts would be going th r
ough your mind when  you wo
uld see German soldiers, 
anything? 

A: You was terrified. You see a new unifor
m, that -- it w as very, very upsetting.  
Q: Did they ever talk to you? 

A: They talk, not a nice way.
 They curse you. They damn
 you all the time, no matter 
what. You never do anything right. No ma
tter what you do, it™s still not right.  
Q: Did you try to make any attempts to escape from
 Buchenwald
? 
A: No, not in 
Germany
, no.  
Q: Because? 

A: Well, it was a foreign land. 
I just wanted to stay in 
Poland
. Didn™t work, so -- oh 
no, I wasn™t going to do 
that, no. Not in -- not in 
Germany
.

Q: And again, when you -- were there any people with you, any young men with you 
who had come all of the -- i-in the different
 camp s with you, the same person wh ether 
-- were -- were there a group of people that  stayed with you through all the different 
camps, or was it every time you went to a 
different camp there were new people? 
A: Very few. Some of them did, but not 
that many, but they moved you around, they 
split you up, you know. You never knew -- no-not too many fr
om my city. I can count 
the -- you know, they
 were with me.  
Q: Were you an especially close gr
oup, those of you from your city? 
A: A close group, sure, yes. 
Q: W-Were you a support to each other, 
do you feel that that helped you? 
A: Well we were talking maybe tomorrow we 
were better, we hope we™ll be liberated. 

We knew it -- it™s not good, but we hope
d tomorrow will be better, that™s it.  
Q: And so you were in 
Buchen wald
 for how long? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know, six months
, eight, something like th at, I don™t know. 
And then  we went to another camp. 

Q: So fo r six months you ju st sat around? 

A: I don™t rememb er doing anything in  
Buchenwald
, no. 
Q: And then they told 
you you™d be leaving? 

A: Well, they didn™t tell us, th-they took us
 one da -- one fine day to another camp. 
Q: And where was that? 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski  
 
March 6, 2007 
 

 
 
55
A: That was the last ca
mp, the third camp in 
Germany
, that was 
Bergen-Belsen, 
and 
that™s where we were -- we were liberated 
by the British at that -- th e British liberated 
Bergen-Belsen
. And three days prior to the libera
tion, they almost killed me. It was 
very close. It happened on a Sunday. I went
 down  the basement, there we take -- you 
know, splash up the f
ace with a little water sometime. A
nd I come up with the -- with a 
can that -- a rusty can that I had -- I find th
ere, and -- it™s water. Sure enough a German 
standing above, and I™m coming up th e steps. 
[speaks German here] 
Wh-Where were 
you? Like he couldn™t see, he wasn™t blind.
 I said, well I -- I went downstairs to get mi 

-- water. M y  hands were shaking and I was 
spilling the water a little bit, and I knew 
it™s going to  be a lot of trouble there. And su
re enough, I c -- I get up closer, closer up. 
He took out the -- the baton, th-the one he 
had the -- on the side there, the stick. But 
that was different one, they made it with lead 
inside it, it™s -- every time he hits you, it 
break your bone. And 
[indecipherable]
 it over the head, and sp
lit my head there, and I 
falls, luckily, I fall forward 
and not back, because back 
is further you fell, you -- you 
wouldn™t be here to tell the story. But I 
fell forward and I hit the edge and I -- and I 
couldn™t get up, of co urse, I was bleeding all over. And I was told that the -- the f -- the 

-- the -- the -- the friends, the one I was sl 
-- they were sleepi
ng next to each other, 
they -- they saw me th ere and they -- they
 dragged me into my
 -- into -- into the 
barrack, in the bunk there, and -- and I was 
unconscious. I was un -- three -- three days 
I didn™t go to pick up my  bread there, nothi
ng like that, I couldn™t, I couldn™t, I was all

black and blue and th e nose was broken. So  anyway  they  -- when th ey come there, the 
British liberated 
Bergen-Belsen
, they took me the portable ambulance, if you will. 
And they  did the best they could, they fix 
my  nose. Bu t they didn™t put it right back, 
it™s a little bit off 
[indecipherable]
 straight, it™s a little bit o
ff. And it can be seen or 
felt if some one touches. And th at was -- that
 was the closest one I ever come to -- to 
die. And -- an-and -- and that was it. So 
I was liberated, and th
en -- then I have a 
couple of cousins, I da -- wasn™t with them
 in same camp. They 
were liberated by the 

Americans, and -- 
Q: Were -- you s -- you said that your cous
ins were in your -- in the same  camp? Did 
you say that? 
A: No, no, I -- in 
a different camp. 
Q: Oh, in a different -- 
A: They were liberat
ed by the Americans. 

Q: -- different camp. B-Before we get to the lib
 -- the liberation, again, let™s ju st talk a 
little more about 
Bergen-Belsen
, did you work there? 
A: No. No, not in 
Bergen-Belsen. 
Q: So ag ain, you just sat. 
A: Yes. I sat there, ye
s, that™s all, mm-hm. 
Q: And I know you had described very movingly, in detail about, in the very  

beginning of your story,
 about the young man who tried to escape and was taken to the 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski

57
gallows. You obviously  had seen a lot of peop
le, dead people in those years sin ce then. 
Wha -- wh a -- how did you -- did you ev er 
get accustomed to seeing dead people? 
A: You never get accustomed, you see there 
was every single night people die there. 
Every single -- never miss one single night 
and nobody would die,
 some people died. 
There were 10 - 15 - 20, even in -- in 
Buchen wald
, it was recorded in 24 hours, 72 
death. So had to take the -- the clothes off, 
drag them out there, put them -- put them 
outside, and then they come 
with the wagon, which we have
 to pull it, and others will 
put -- put them on the wagons like -- like s
ticks, you know, they  look like sticks, and 
move them away. Every single day, every 
single day, never mi
ss a  day. There was 
none on -- any corpses outside. You have to
 put them outside. Take the clothes off, 
and put them outside.  

Q: What does that do to a 18 - 19 
- 20 year old to have to do that? 
A: It doesn™t look good at all, we don™t 
feel good. We feel well, today is them, 
tomorrow i -- it would be me, may b
e. That™s how they feel.  
Q: Was there a feeling of sadness that you 
had, or was it fear? What -- what do you 
think your emotions are when 
you were forced to see this? 
A: Well, it was fear and sadness, both. Yeah.  

Q: And was there any inte
rmingling with women in 
Bergen-Belsen
? 
A: No, there was th -- chicken wire was 
dividing up, that was the women with the 
men. There were nothing co mmon, there™s nothing to  talk. They  were -- they walked

in their misery, we have our misery 
[indecipherable]
 no. There was nothing to  talk 
about. 
Q: So in  all of those years, once you went 
-- started going to the labor camps and th en 
to 
[indecipherable]
 
A: 
[indecipherable]
  
Q: -- an-an-and 
Bergen-Belsen
, you -- you really had no cont
act with girls or wo men? 
A: No, I never did, no, no.  
Q: And for a young man at that age, that 
mu st have been  difficult. Or was it not on 
your mind? 
A: No, that wasn™t on my mind at 
all, because we have problems.  
Q: You didn™t have the luxu
ry of thinking about that. 
When the -- tell me about the 
liberation, what -- what was it like? I kno
w you were sick, you said, but did you 

understand what was happening
 when the British soldiers
 came? Did you know what 
was happening? 
A: I understood what™s happ
ened  because they  -- they took all the wires down, and -- 
and th -- and they buried the 
corpses in -- in -- in the right
 place the way it should be 
buried, no-not mass graves. And it was -- it 
-- it was different ball game altogether. 
And even after the war -- after the liberation, th
at is, a lot of -- lot of people died there, 
by th e hundreds and thousands because they™r
e not used to eat. The stomach -- there 
wasn™t much of a stomach, it™s 
all shrunk, then they
 tried to expand, and they with all 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski  
 
March 6, 2007 
 

 
 
59
kinds of diseases and sicknesses, you know, a
nd th ey co uldn™t take it. So a lot of them 
died. They have all kind diarrheas, and stu
ff like that. You couldn™t go to  the bathroom 

because there™s only one bathroom an-and 50 
or 100 - 200 people 
wanted to go. So 
the-they built something th e 
outside, li-like a -- a -- you k
now, and people go there, 
outside. Like -- like trenches with -- I don™t 
know. Anyway, it wasn't very nice, and so 
after that, like I mentioned, I had the couple 
of cousins there who were liberated by the 
-- by the Americans. They couldn™t go to ever
y camp, but in the gip -- in the big camps 
they did go and looked up names. But afte
r the war you -- you can get your own name, 
you didn™t have any mo re a number. 

Q: What -- what was your -- you were 
given a number? What
 was your number? 
A: I can™t remember n o w, but I got there 
about six, seven numb ers there. I don™t 
remember that, I don™t look at that. 

Q: I-In what camp were you 
given the number? Was it in  
Germany
 or in 
Poland
? 
A: That was in 
Germany
, I think. Yes, anyway, so i -- 
th -- my -- my  two cousins, my 
mitha -- my mother and their fa
ther were sister brother, so
 that makes it -- mak e us 
first cousins. So they come and -- and a 
f-few of th -- few of those big camps like 

Buchen wald
 and they come to 
Bergen-Belsen, 
look up my  name, oh they saw me 
there 
[indecipherable]
 you know and he said, well, wh
at do you have to lose here, 
let™s go in the medical zone. And I already find mine Aunt 
Rifka
. Nothing do with -- 
with me, she not relati -- she not related to me at all. 
Rifka
 is my cousin™s mother™s

sister.  So nothing to me. She™s alr eady th
ere, but I knew her 
from -- from the ghetto. 
So we went to -- in the American zone
, and we stayed there in a place named 
Bamberg, 
not too far from 
Nuremberg
 where those -- those criminals were jud -- you 
know, judged. And we stayed there a
nd then  they want
ed to come to 
America,
 and I 
didn™t feel like I wanted to come to 
America
. It™s -- something was bothering me. 
What it was is, I want to go as far as 
I possibly can, I don™t have no -- no borders. 
Although it™s a fri endly 
border here with 
Canada
, but th -the bord ers upset me  in 
Poland
. There was Russians, there were the Ge
rmans, none of them were good for the 
Jews. So they went to 
America
 and I went a different direction altogether. I went to 
Australia
. And -- 
Q: Right, right. We™ll talk about 
Australia
 in a minute. Di -- whe-when the British 
came to you in -- in 
Bergen-Belsen
 for -- at liberation, di-did you feel a sense of 
freedom at that point? What -- what -- what was it? 

A: I felt a sense of freedom cause I knew 
I was liberated. And th-the loudspeak er 
loudly was speaking ev ery la
nguage there. You could understand that the food is on 
the way, and the help  is on the way. And -- 
and we feel good, because the wires came 
down. Oh, that™s okay. Th-The wire -- th
e wires came down a
nd -- and we --we knew 
we were liberated, and that was it. 

Q: What were your feel -- I mean, in all 
these years of being a prisoner, and now 
you™re liberated. 

 
Interview with Felix Nicinski  
 
March 6, 2007 
 

 
 
61
A: You had a good feeling wh
en you were liberated, then
 the -- the -- another thing 
was hope that my mother and father will be still alive, and the -- th e rest of the family, 
but -- 
Q: Did you consider goin
g back to your hometown? 
A: I never did. 
Q: Because? 

A: I didn™t want to go 
back because I had the 
[indecipherable]
 a gut feeling I had that 
I™ll -- I™ll find nobody there. I di -- I didn't 
want to go. Bu t my  cousin s did. They  -- 
they -- they encourage me to go and 
I said no, I don™t want to go to  
Poland
 back there, 
no. So they went and they went
 to their city, nobo
dy there. They went
 to my little city 
where I was born, and there was nobody left th
ere either. See, what
 they did is they 
took the people out, the men, to the cemeter
y, and they  dug a -- a trench there, didn™t 
know what for. And then after 
they finish, they took all th e rest of th -- of the people 

out there and shoot them and bulldozed  them down. 
Q: And do you think th at™s what
 happened to your parents? 
A: I guess. That™s all I can guess, I don™t know.
