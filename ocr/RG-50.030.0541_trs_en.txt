Question: This is an interview with 
Lili Brody-Carmosino
 conducted by
 Ina 
Navazelski s
 on Thursday, October 15
th
, 2009 in 
Wash ington, D.C. 
First of all, 
thank you very, very much
, Lili
, for agreeing to talk to us. 
Answer: My pleasure. 
Q: We know that this is not about the easie
st of topics, and we™re
 very grateful that 
you™ve agreed to share your story with us. 

A: It™s fine
, thank you. 
Q: You™re welcome. Let™s start li Œ where we
 always start, and where they say in the 
fairly tales, too, let™s start at the beginning. 

A: Okay . 

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about who you
 are as a child: wh en you were born , the 
date you were born, the fami ly you were 
born into, and we™ll 
take it from there. 
A: Okay . I was born in 1938, June 2
nd
, 1938, in  
Ia
i, Romania
. And we all lived in a 
courty ard, the whole family, cousins. I have a brother, his name is 
Morris
, and my 
mo m and dad. And my dad was a tailor, but
 he was a designer, and we were quite 
comfortably well off in 
Ia
i
. And I believe at the time that war broke out, wh ich 
was, I think I was four years old, and 
there was a lot of 
commotion out in the 
backyard; meaning actually the front part of
 this courty ard wh ere about four of our 
family, different families lived; which gra
ndparents usually just buy a house and

continue to build  so the fa
mily can stay together. And th is commo tion started, and 
my  grandma Œ 
Q: Can I stop right there? We™re still gonna ta
lk about family at 
this moment, before 
the war breaking out. 

A: Okay . 

Q: I™d like a few more details.  

A: Okay . 
Q: Is the Œ was this courtyard in the build
ing where your fami ly
 lived, was it in in 
the middle of a town, li Œ in 
Ia
i
, or was it over to the si
de, was it a suburban area? 
How would you describe that? 

A: I would Œ the little bit of memory I ha
ve of it is, it was more on the side, it 
definitely wasn™t in the main city
. Ia
i 
is a very small shtetl,
 which is like a little 
town, and it was definitely in the farmer 
part, very rural. And my cousins, my 
grandmother Œ my  grandfather wasn™t aliv
e when  I was born, and my  grandmother 
lived in one of the houses, and I™m not su
re if one of the c
ousins lived with her. 
Then  there were other cousins. And I Œ my  
memory serves me, we Œ there had to be 
about four or five families. My Œ 

Q: All related to you?

A: All related. And we lived in this cour
tyard that apparently
, before my time, I 
guess my grandparents built this, and just
 kept on expa
nding as people 
got married. 
Q: But it wasn™t farming country, it wasn™t Œ 
A: It wasn™t farming country. 
Q: Œ farming country . 

A: On the side there were farms, but 
we weren™t into farming. I believe my 
grandfather, who I never had a chance to
 meet, was a fisherman. Very well-to-do 
and very well acknowledged in the community
, which my mother always told me he 
had a great big monument that was dedicate
d to him. I never had th e pleasure of 
meeting him. We, I remember, lived in th
e front part, whether we were the last 
family, or my  mo ther was yul Œ the younges
t to get married, and I think she was, 
that™s where we lived, and my father, be
ing a tailor, worked out of the house. 
Q: So it sounds like Œ it sounds like you lived
 in either a small to
wn or a village, but 
in Œ inside the village, rather
 than i-in the ac Œ in a re
ally rural are Œ areas. When 
you™re a tailor Œ 

A: Oh, I would say inside, yes Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes.

Q: When  you™re a tailor, then you have client
s that come on the main street, or a side 
street, and they come with their Œ their Œ their Œ 
A: But he wasn™t just a tailo
r my father, he really Œ so
me people use patterns, he 
made his own pattern, and that™s Œ that™s another part of later on in the story. And he 

actually designed women™s coats. So it was, 
you know, out of th e 
house, and he had 
a couple people wo rk ing fo r him. 

Q: So it™s like a dressmakers™ shop.  
A: Exactly, not so mu ch  female Œ both, bu
t mostly coats. Coats, jackets. And I 
remember as young as I was, which I had to be about four years old, that™s when my  
memory serves me, is I reme
mb er my  grandmother took care of both my  brother and 
my self. My brother 
Mo rris
 is two years older than I am. And Œ 
Q: That was one of my questions. 

A: Yes, and my  gran dmother, who was well 
in her, I would say 80™s, who was mo re 
like a mother, she really brought us up, be
cause my  mo th er wo rk ed  with  my  d ad ,  
and there were other workers; so they ob
viously were well off enough, cause th ere 
was help. Bu t we were taken care of by my  grandmother. 

Q: Do you reme mb er your father
 in the shop at all, or do Œ 
A: Oh, absolutely, I could Œ 
Q: What kind of me Œ what kind 
of me mo ries  co me to  y ou r  min d ?

A: About my father? 
Q: About your parents, their working in  the shop. 

A: My mother was slim, pretty, fortunat
ely did not, and lateron in the story I™ll 
explain, did not look Jewish, wh ich is wh
at saved us. My dad 
Œ I resemble my dad 
mo re than my  mo m Œ was just Œ I Œ in my  
eyes just a wonderful, kind, very gentle 
with us. And he Œ he Œ they were busy
, but my dad was never too busy to pay 
attention, to myself especially, being the girl.  
Q: Well, you were the little girl, yeah. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And th
e cousins I remember as yo
ung Œ going way back in my  
memory, my favorite place at the time, from
 what I™m told, and I 
do remember is the 
play Œ the house must have 
been up on stilts or somethi
ng, because the kids played 
underneath, in the dirt. And my  cousins and I, that™s what I remember wa Œ we™re 

going way back, and my  mo ther and my  dad 
and my  brother reminded me that that™s 
where we loved to play, in the mud unde
rn eath. And my  cousins loved to thro w 
stones, and a couple of times 
actually cracked my  head, and Œ 
Q: And boy, did they  get into trouble. 

A: Œ being that Romanians are Gypsies, my
 mo ther had her theories about certain, I 
guess holistic, or whatever. If you have a 
wo und on your head, you get bread and

vinegar and put it on the wound. And those things I rememb er being told to me 
because that™s how it affected my brain. 

Q: Well, did you Œ do you re
member having a Œ you know
, th-the bump on your 
head , do you Œ 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: Oh yeah? 

A: And I reconnected this 
way back with my  cousins 
who are the only ones who 
survived in 
Israel
, and reminded me that that™s what 
he did, and very
 happy about it. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But that™s about where it Œ it stops, til war. 
Q: And do Œ was this then yo
ur wo rld, the wo rld of the courty ard, your family Œ 
A: Abso l Œ 
Q: Œ your mo ther and father, nobody outside. 
Or did you have a se
nse of neighbors, 
or Œ 
A: Yes, there Œ 
Q: Œ Gentiles, or Œ 

A: Œ there were Œ it™s funny you said, next
 door there were Gen
tiles, and now Œ how 
I happened  to know, and I don™t want to
 go ahead with the Holocaust, or the 
beginning, or the bomb ing, is my  mo m, 
who used to wear a 
babushka on her head,

and my  dad was always busy 
with Œ the measuring tape 
was always around him, and 
he always had a scissor in his hand Œ my  ne
ighbor Œ our neighbor
s were of Œ not of 
the Jewish faith, because when 
things started, my mother 
Œ I don™t know if you want 
me to go into that now, that™s Œ that™s th
e next part I rememb er is suddenly th ere was 
a lot of commo tion, and I don™t rememb er 
exactly how it happened, but I know we 
had to put on Œ my  grandma told me we ha
ve to put on this ye
llow band with the 
Jewish star. And the neighbors next door, th
at part I reme mb er, were just looking at 
us. And I was young, and my  Œ my  mo ther 
didn™t look Jewish, and my  father was 
taken out with a lot of other men, and th
ere were guns and things, and thi Œ all I 
reme mb er th Œ my  grandmother taki
ng my head, and hiding it in Œ 
Q: In her stomach. 

A: Œ her apron. And I remember my mother
 saying, an d I reme mb er hating her that, 
don™t kill him, don™t shoot the Jew. I™ll ta
ke care of the Jew in my own way. The 

neighbors knew she was Jewish
, but thank God they didn™t Œ 
Q: Say anything. 

A: Œ say anything. And this 
is one me mo ry I really don™t want to rememb er, but the 
next thing was, all of a sudden I peeked
 out from my  grandmother, and there was 
this woman yelling don™t, please don™t. 
And I reme mb er she had a fat belly. And 
they shot, something came out of her belly, and I remember a Œ it was a Œ a fetus.

Q: It was a baby. 
A: And I remember her just yelling, I 
couldn™t understand this Œ I™m sorry Œ 

Q: That™s okay. 
A: Œ she said, just Œ just kill me, y ou™
ve already killed me, just kill me. And I 
thought well, it™s a ma
tter of time where they™re gonna 
get my  mo th er, 
they™re gonna 
get my  brother, they™re gonna get my  grandmother. That™s all that I rememb er, 
really, right there, that to me Œ 
Q: Did you know th e lady? 
A: N-No, no, but that went on, and those ar
e the memories that 
Œ that™s one of my  
worst remembrance, and from there on, thi
ngs just Œ I Œ I remember thinking, how 
can my mother say she would Œ she will 
kill him herself, how could she do that? 

And that™s about wh ere it stopped. The only
 memo ry I have after that, we were 
fairly well off, and I think there were ev
en people who helped
 my mom clean the 
house, and obviously my  da
d must have been  doing all right, is suddenly , two 
[indecipherable]
 we were si Œ all sleeping in ou
r house, ourselves, my mother and 
my father, and Œ 

Q: Can I bri Œ I™m sorry I interrupt, but I wa
nt to bring back to Œ to what you had 
said earlier. Your Œ if we Œ you se Œ y
ou rememb er your neighbors just looking out 
the window or lookin
g in the street Œ

11
A: No, no, they were out Œ 
Q: Œ on the street Œ  

A: Œ in their yard looking. There was like a 
fence, like a picket fence, and they were 
looking at us, and my  grandmother and my  
brother and I were like in a corner. My 
mo m was like right next to these Œ they 
were Germans. And she wasn™t wearing the 
band, and I couldn™t understand why we 
were wearing the ye
llow band. And my  
father was there and they took all the men,
 and it looked like so
me of them were Œ 
they Œ they were fu
cking them with the gun. And 
I thought they™re gonna kill my 
father. And I couldn™t understand how we 
were doing that, we were wearing the 
band and all, and she wasn™t. And then sh e 
said what she did. From there on, I don™t 
Œ I can Œ I can™t remember ju
st exactly what ha
ppened except 
this horrible, horrible 
Œ this wo man being shot, a
nd yelled wh e Œ I don™t even  reme mb er, I reme mb er my  
grandmother just took and put
 our heads in the apron so
 that we couldn™t hear 
anything, she covered our ears, and I Œ it™
s like everything black
ed out from there. 
There could never be a worse enemy or a wo
rse thing I could ever see in my  life 
other than what I just saw there. That was th
e ugliest thing I™ve ever seen in my life, 
what happened to 
the woman. I do Œ 
Q: At age four Œ

12
A: Œ I don™t even ha Œ rememb er Œ my  fa
ther was spared, obviously, and Œ because 
we went back in the house and I didn™t Œ 
I re Œ I remember not seeing anything, 
because my grandmother just totally Œ 
Q: Do you have a feeling, 
when  you lo oked  at the neighbors on th e Œ on the other 
side of the picket fence, were they Œ 
did you have any sense of how they were 
looking? Was it curiosity, was it horror, was it grief? 
A: I Œ I Œ 
Q: Were these people you knew well a
nd liked, or were they distant? 
A: I Œ I don™t really remember. A ll I do re
me mb er is they didn™
t tell, because they 
knew my  mo ther was Jewish, and I think th
ey were in awe, and I think it was a 
comb ination of everything you 
just said. They were in shock, they were petrified. 
They  had to be. And knowing my mo ther wa
s Jewish and denied it, and she wasn™t 

wearing Œ fortunately they didn™t say anyt
hing, and obviously they  were fond of her, 
and I Œ I Œ I think th ey were ju
st frozen in sp ace. From there on, as I say, my gram Œ 
the only thing Œ I reme mb er my  grandmothe
r, but yet I don™t, but I remember she 
covered both our head s, and 
I Œ we cou Œ I couldn™t even  breathe, I rememb er, and I 
didn™t want to.  
Q: You were four years old. 
A: I didn't want to see. I was four years old Œ

13
Q: Four years old. 
A: Œ but that™s something I will never forg
e Œ I™ll never forget. That was the worst 
thing I™ve even seen in my life. I c
ouldn™t believe a human  being co uld do 
something like that to another human be
ing. Bu t that was the beginning of many 
horro rs that I saw that I never should have
 seen, which is why I™m here. It Œ it never 
should have happened, that people 
can do th is to people. And that Œ 
Q: Did you Œ were Œ the age difference, 
was there an age difference between your 
parents? Your father and your mo
ther, was he older than she was? 

A: Yeah, he was just Œ my Œ my father was born, I believe, 1911, and my  mo th er in 

1913. 
Q: Oh, so very Œ th
ey™re the sa Œ almo
st the sa me age.  
A: Yeah, they were Œ 
Q: Œ the same generation. 

A: Yeah, yeah, oh ye
ah, oh yeah, and Œ 
Q: Did he look Jewish? 

A: I don™t know what looking Jewish is Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ because I don™t thi
nk you do, and I don™t.  
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino

14
A: But he was of fair skin, and she wasn
™t really dark, but she did not. And she Œ 
Q: So sh e di Œ she definitely did not. 
A: Œ she played a good part, yeah. 
Q: Okay . 
A: My mo th er played  a good part, and the 
understanding goes that when  Œ after the 
Holo caust, and what have you, a lot of thi
ngs happened  to her that Œ I don™t know, 

apparently  she was pregnant and thrown do
wn the street, or downstairs. I didn™t see 
any of that. I don™t Œ 

Q: Okay, we™ll come to those moments Œ 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Œ wh ere Œ wh ere you can tell us what 
you do rememb er and wh at you were told, 
and Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ and so on. 
A: But from there on it was like a blank, it™s 
like, to this day I didn™t want to re-
remember that Œ that 
[indeciphera ble]
. And then the journey started, and Œ 
Q: So, after this, do you have like a bla
nk? I Œ do you rememb er going back in the 
house, do you rememb er Œ 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino  
October 15, 2009 

 

 
 
15
A: I do rememb er going back  in the house, but I don™t rememb er what was said. 
There was a lot of mu mb ling among my  mo
ther and my  Œ my  Œ my  grandmother, 

who apparently Œ I don™t know if Œ I can™t
 even tell you if grandma was killed when 
the bombs came, because shortly after that, 
I remember we were sleeping, and there 
was like a Œ a Œ a Œ like a rubber th ing li-like Œ like an earthquake. And I remember 
Œ it still Œ it was a joke in the family th
at my mother said, 
what™s happening? My 
father said, it™s 
tun
(ph)
 pasheening
(ph). In Romanian that means it™s a tank on 
rubber wh eels. And she said, no, no, it do
esn™t sound like that, it so unds like, you 
know Œ then  we looked out and all of a 
sudden it was like Fourth of July, and it was 
just Œ it wa Œ like firecrackers were going
 off. And I remember they tried to grab, 
and it just happened so quick . They Œ my  mo
th er grabbed my  brother and my  father, 
myself and we ran. And as we ran, it was 
in the courtyard, and like, the courty ard 
was gone. It was just Œ bombs were Œ were
 falling all over, and I don™t know if Œ in
 
Euro pe
 the Œ the Russians wear these fur 
skwerta
(ph), th-the fur coats. Somehow 
or other she had that. Well, she Œ all I re
me mb er, we were running a Œ out of the 
courty ard, and as we™re running, I guess th
e force of the bombs lifted me up because 
I was th Œ to the point they
 had to drag me down and 
somehow or other we managed 
to go against this, I don™t know if it wa
s a Œ a wood wall or a stone wall, and I 
reme mb er thinking, we™re gonna be hit, I 
don™t Œ these things, there™s fire, the whole

courty ard, and our house wa
s blown up, th ere was nothi
ng to  Œ the clothes on our 
bodies is all we had, and Œ  
Q: So you made it out 
in the nick of time? 
A: Apparently. All I remember is we stayed
 there, and as we ran there were bodies, 
bodies all over the place. We just ran and ra
n and we stayed next to this wall. And 
the bombs were going up. My  mo th er kept
 on saying, pray to Gran dma. So 

apparently  Grandma mu st have Œ I don™t kno w if she was alive or dead. And we ran, 
and in running, my  parents were saying don
™t look, don™t look, 
but there were just 
bodies all over the place. And we ran, and I 
do remember this, we ran to a hospital, 
that™s the only other part I remember. And 
at that time, I don™t know I Œ if it was 

Russians or what, but we Œ we were sitti
ng on these benches type of thing ag ainst 
the wall and wa Œ I Œ I Œ all I rememb er is
 my father stood up to, I think it was a 
Russian, they wanted the watches and th
e jewelry, and they™re women. And my 
father was very upset. I remember I neve
r saw him this upset, I remember I n ever 
saw him this upset and this frightened. I 
can™t Œ I blacked out wh at happened after 
that, but the part I do know, from that hospi
tal, how we got out 
of there, I don™t 
know. But after getting out of there 
we mu st have run all the way to 
Bucharest, 
Romania
.

you looked on a map where

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and where

A: Yes.

[indecipherable]
 
Bucharest. 
And we stayed there, and that wa
s quieter for some reason, and my  
father, apparently they rent
ed, I don™t know exactly what
 it was because I think one 
of my  cousins somehow or other was there.
 Whether this was a family that lived 
there, I can™t remember the connection. 
Q: So Œ can I interrupt for a minute now? 
Ia

Q: So, in other words, it wasn™t Germans w
ho came in where all this was happening, 
it was Russians who came in?  
A: Germans were bombing us, the Russi
ans were robbing us. I remember th e 
Russians were robbing us, but it wa
s the Germans that were bombing Œ 
Q: Bomb ing, yeah. 

A: Œ 
Ia
i. 
Q: And who shot the woman? 
A: It wa Œ they were German. They were 
German because the wo

Du bist Jude Œ

Du bist eine Œ eine Juden. 
A: Œ

 young, th at whether in ya Œ in

Q: I want to stop for a moment before we get to

A: Yeah. 
Q: But I Œ until this moment, I didn™t realize 
that it was also Œ that you first had like 
Œ your first exposu
re was a German. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And this Œ and this bombing and th e sh
ooting, but that also you had experien ced

A: It™s a lot quieter. We were like in an 
alley, and my  father again opened  Œ was 
work ing, and he was now making some uni
forms for the Germans,
 which he did not 
want to do. My mo ther, I reme mb er saying,
 well you have to, how else are we gonna

A: No, the yellow star came off in
 Bucharest. 
Q: So th at means, were you passing? Wer

Q: So th e Œ some of the bodies 
could have been of your relatives. 
A: Could have been. All I kn
ow is we ran on foot, and as
 young as I was, and it Œ 
there was total blank. Everything Œ my  othe
r cousins Œ and it turn ed out they  Œ some 
did surv ive. 
Q: Do you remember what time of year it 
was when all of that happened in the 
courty ard? 

A: It Œ it wasn™t Œ it had to be closer
 Œ November. October, November, December, 
because it was cold, it was cold.  

Q: Okay . 

A: And by the time we got to 
Bucharest,
 it was warm. It was warm. So we ran Œ 
Q: So it was several months? 

A: Oh, we ran, yeah. We Œ 
we hid in forests and I Œ I 
Œ all I Œ the part after the 
bombing and th e Œ the hospital is Œ I rememb
er that. After that, I remember, it™s like 
waking up and being in 
Bucharest.
 I know was warm because I rememb er all I had 
was like a slip, and so it had to be warm
. I just remember slight pictures. And I 

reme mb er my  dad was working, he had a 
factory and he was working making clo Œ 
coats and stuff. My mom work
ed with him. We were basically on our own, my 
brother and my self, but that™s the way youwere brought up, and we stayed within 

the courtyard. And I remember my father
 saying he couldn™t 
do this. He™s making

coats for people who are killing and killed our
 relatives, and the other picture that I 
d o  rememb er in  
Bucharest
 is my  brother Œ my  brothe
r and I were going so mewhere, 
I don™t know where it was, a movie, or I 
don™t even know. He was to take care of 
me, that was his responsibility. 
Q: For a little boy. 

A: No matter for Œ yeah, he was two year
s older, so whether I™m six  now, I don™t 
know. But I remember
 some street, and I know this was 
Bucharest
, there was this 
man who was like stretched out with a stic
k in his stomach and he was opened up, 
and it said, this is what happens to Jews. 
And there were flies all over him. And my  
brother took my face like don™t look, do
n™t look, and I remember thinking, I saw 
something like this. [aside: No, no. Some
body wants to see?] I saw something like 
this with the woman, and here was this ugly picture. Th
at™s all I remember. T h at Œ 
and somehow or other, back came the 
yellow bands, and from then on, all I 
reme mb er is running. War broke out, runn
ing. And my  next memo ry is, we™re 
somehow or other ca Œ we™re like in trenches
, in Œ in these tren
ches, my mother and 
my  father and my  brother. Somehow or ot
her we got caught. Exactly how we got, I 
don™t know, but then  we were put, and we we
re well off and all, we were put in this 
cattle type of 
boxcart
, and they were Œ it seemed lik
e a hundred people just Œ we 
couldn™t breathe. It was dirty, it was th 
Œ and everybody was like Œ I don™t know, 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino

24
like in shock. And I Œ I Œ as young as I 
was, I couldn™t understand why are we on 
here with these people? We don™t belong 
here. And people were crying, there were 
babies crying, people were defecating an
d i Œ we were just mobbed together. And 
we figured, you know, a lot of people were
 crying, saying we™re gonna be killed, 
we™re gonna be killed. Every
body had the yellow star on th
eir arms. And then, all of 
a sudden the boxcar mu st have dis-attach
ed, because we were moving fast, like the 

train were just move Œ real fast. And su
ddenly, everything stood still, and we Œ you 
couldn™t see out because there was 
a bok Œ there were no windows. 
Q: So you were locked 
in this dark space Œ 
A: We were locked in this
 dark space, and we had no id
ea what was in there except 
a lot of people crying, yelling, what have
 you. My m Œ again,
 now I™m, my mother, 
my brother, my father, and I 
don™t even remember where, 
it was just fear. And in my 
mind I thought we were just going to go on 
a trip, but why all these people? Cause I 
was so young. But then wh
en it got dis-attached, when
 the boxcar became dis-
attached, everybody stopped, and you kn
ow, they couldn™t open th e door, and the 
men, some how or other managed to open 
the door, and we saw the rest of the 
boxcar, with probably mo re people, go on, an
d I was le Œ we were left on the track. 
So the men, some ar Œ I ga
thered th e men, the people in there opened it up, and 
everyone just scattered out. Families just 
ran every which way. 
And I remember we

never left my mother and my father, we we
ren™t allowed to, we just had to stick like 
glue. And we ran and we ran and we got in
to Œ and this was cute, I was telling my 
husband, we crossed Œ what they  used to do 
is they used  to take a wad of money and 
wrap it around an explosiv
e. When you™ve pick
ed up th e money the explosive goes 
off, but being at the age that I was, we ran 
over Œ this I remember d efinitely Œ this 
little bridge, and I saw there was a wad of
 money. And I went for it, and my 
mother™s going no, no, no, no, no. She 
really thought I was gonna explode any 
minute. Well it turned out it really was Œ 
Q: A wad of money. 

A: Œ a wad of money. And that wad of mo
ney crossed us Œ we 
were no Œ we ran by 
foot, or from this boxcar, wherever we 
were Œ it took us. I reme mb er it was in 
Budapest
. And we stayed in th is very Œ it Œ 
it looked like a great big Œ I rememb er it 
had a white picket fence, and it was like a co lonial type of beautiful house. And this 

is gonna sound very strange, it™
s like in Œ I™ve been there 
before. And we were in the 
cellar, and what you do is Œ these were, I 
think Jewish people who crossed you over 
the border. They  took your rings if you had 
no money. They took money, well I had 
the money, and my  mother had rings, or
 I guess she had jewelry she had hidden, I 
have no idea. But I remember we were to l
eave, and my  mo ther told my  brother and

I that I was a rotten kid, because I decided 
I™d been here before 
and I Œ I™m gonna go 
upstairs Œ 
Q: Investigate. 
A: Œ because I haven™t seen the daylight
. And I wandered out, and I knew exactly. 
And I Œ how I remember this is my pare
nts a Œ even told me. I knew exactly. If 
there™s such a thing as 
déjà vu
, this was Œ I knew exactly where I was. And I walked 
around th e block and I knew wh ere I was,
 no one can tell me otherwise. I knew 
where I was. And th e man who was supposed to cross us over, not borders, to 
another place, into the woods, and in th
e woods somebody else would meet us. And 
if you have mo re money, you give them a
nd take you to another 
destination, that I 
remember. Well, they Œ my mother and fath
er didn™t want to leave because I was 
gone. Fo rtunately, I found Œ I knew wh ere I 
was, I found my  way back, got a heck of 
a whack on my rear end, and we ran. An
d I was just telling my  husband that the 
woods were so thick, that now I Œ I Œ I™m
 amazed why there were no animals, but 

that™s where we stayed, what Œ there wa
s no food, we weren™t given food. You pay 
the money to  the person who takes you to th
at part of the woods and you hide there, 
and from there someone, at dusk or nighttime, 
I can™t even remember that part, takes 

us and leads us to another destination, 
and you hide in that wood, and Œ in th e 
woods. And the woods was, you couldn't se
e. How Œ I rememb er
 being so young,

thinking how are they
 gonna find us? I can™t Œ it™s 
all dark in the woods. But 
apparently  we made our way all the way 
to  another place, where somebody reported 
us. 
Q: In
 Hu nga r y
 now. 
A: In
 Hu nga r y
. And there, we™re put in jail. An
d for the first time Œ one minute Œ 
first time my mo ther and I, and my  brothe
r and my father were separated. The men 
had to go in one, it™s like a courtyard. I 
reme mb er it had like a fountain in front, and 
there were women an d the women had babies
, and they were trying to feed the 
babies. People would Œ the women were de
fecating, and I never s Œ I would never 
see my fath er or my brother again, so we 
figured this is it. We were caught. We got 
this far, we™ll never survive again. But 
again lu ck was on our side, somehow or 
other. The door Œ I don™t know if we were 
there a day, definitely overnight Œ they 
pushed water and stale bread 
on Œ under the door. And if
 you got to it, you got to 
eat, if you didn™t, fine. But somehow or othe
r the door was left open, this one, was it 
night or dusk, I don™t rememb er. I do reme
mber my  mo ther grabbing my  hand, and 
we ran, along with the other people. And 
we hid out, was like a farm, and there were 
Œ I don™t know what you call, but they were
 like a stable, and there was hay. And I 
don™t even Œ I can™t remember how, but I re
memb er they put tape on our mo uth, and 
we were told don™t a Œ don™t breathe. So, some Œ

28
Q: Your mo ther™s mouth too, or ju st children™s? 
A: The kids, the kids, and we were not to 
sneeze, cough, nothing. And th e part that I 
reme mb er, wh ich  is al mo st co mic al, a
nd I was thinking Œ and I didn™t know my  
father and my  brother were also let out. So
mebody left the door open, I think it was 
done deliberately. What happened is we 
were in hay, co vered with hay, and I 
reme mb er my  mo th er say i n g ,  n o t  a wo rd
, don™t move. Whispering, don™t mo ve, 
don™t cough, don™t breathe, 
nothing. Well, all I can reme mb er thinking is, I looked 
down  and I saw these gorgeous blue eyes. 
It was a German. It was a German man. 

Blonde hair, these piercing bl
ue eyes, and he had a pitchf
ork. And I™m thinking to 
myself, if he™s going to take that and pu
sh it in, how is my mo
ther gonna know that 
I™m gonna be killed and I™m hur
ting. And I™m Œ I couldn™t 
imagine, how do I let her 
know, how do I let my mother 
know that he™s gonna do 
that. He saw me. We made 
eye contact, there™s no question about that. 
And I thought, this is it, he™s gonna do 
that, my mother won™t know. The 
blood will Œ these crazy things Œ 
Q: Well, they™re normal, they™re logical for a child. Yo u™ve been to
ld not to breathe, 
not to talk, and this Œ 

A: Well, and I rememb er somebody yelled
 du J uden
? Are there Jews there? And he 
said, 
nein, nein, nostu
(ph)
 kein Juden
. But he was looking right at me. And I

thought, oh God, God, maybe he won™t do 
it. After that, I reme
mber they took the 
tape off and the running started. Now we ran from Œ 
Q: We Œ I Œ wa Œ was your father
 and brother also in that hay? 
A: Yeah, but we didn™t know th at. We Œ 

Q: So when you Œ 

A: Œ my mother and I just ran and then sh
e must have realized that I didn™t know, 
but I saw, and we had no time to acknowled
ge or hug, we all ran. And somehow or 
other there was four of us. There probably 
were a lot more, but everybody ran. The 
only thing I reme mb er after that, and we were
 very lucky, I have
 no complaints, is 
we again hid. There were nobody to cross 
the borders, whether we got Œ I think we 
ran by foot, that becomes blank. I rememb
er cold. All we had was Œ bathing, there 
was no such  thing. Food, I don™t know how a nd what my  mo ther gave me, or even if 

we ate. That wasn™t even important. Surv
ival was the only important thing. And 
again hiding, and being quiet. It was like 
I™ll never talk again. I™ll never see my 
family again. It Œ it was just, this is my wa
y of life, this is how I have to Œ we have 
to live. And my  brother wouldn™t even talk
 to me, he Œ there was no talking, it was 
just surviving. Save your stre
ngth, survive. And we hid ou
t, I believe, in fields. We 
got, somehow or other my  next memo ry is ot Œ in 
Salzburg, Austria. 
And we were 
like, hiding in a field, but I remember 
seeing this Œ I assume it was a German Œ

Austrian lady, was in her garden, and I re
memb er she was pulling up carrots or some 
Œ and she deliberately took them and threw 
them like behind her, like here they are; 
here Jew, eat; which was wonderful. So we
 had Œ and my  Œ my  next me mo ry was in 
Beth Bialik
, that™s the displaced persons camp
. How we got there, I don™t know. 
Q: But you were still t
ogether as a family? 
A: We were still together, we 
Œ we ran together everywhere.  
Q: It™s a miracle. 
A: It was a miracle, and we are very lucky,
 because we should ha
ve been Œ we were 
going to  either 
Auschwitz
 or 
Dachau
, or Œ half of the people
 that didn™t survive. 
Only  I think two people sur Œ

Q: Okay . 
A: It was in 
Austria
. How we got there Œ 
Q: And so now the war is over? 
A: We didn™t know if it was over, because
 now the quota was open. We couldn™t go 
to 
Isra Œ 
we stayed back up Œ we were in th
is displaced people™s camp , and there 
were people from 
Russia
, people from ru Œ each one was a group. The Ro manians, 
we were like in Œ I would say the size of 
this room. There was like a great big, I 
don™t know what you call th
em, like cabins, long Œ 
Q: Barracks. 
A: Barracks, exactly. And each family had 
like a bed, and if you had two or three 
kids, the kids slept in one bed, and the mo
ther and father slept in Œ but could have 
been five, six, eight, 10 families in these ba
r Œ one on one side, hi Œ and a curtain on 
one side, a m-ma terial curtain blocking at
 night and another. My father, for it™s Œ 
how, I don™t know, because he wasn™t a viol
ent man, but he came that Œ became that, 
is he was in charge of th e Ro manians, 
another man was in charge of the Polish, 
another one the Lithuanians and Ru ssians. And somehow or other I rememb er 

always sleeping with my  brother. I do re
member having lice in my hair from the 
sweating, what have you. Bu t I rememb er 
the one thing which was always awful, is 
if anyone in that camp was caught stealing,
 or doing anything against the other one,

they would be punish ed. My father, the Œ 
my gentle father was the head of the 
Russians, and I do remember this and to this
 day I will not sleep with my back to a 
door, is I happened to  peek out and I saw 
this man walking on 
the ledge up a Œ and I 
was the only one, I saw his face, but we neve
r Œ anyway, they cau
ght him. My father 
had to punish him to show the rest. Ch
ildren, everybody had to watch. And I 
thought, he can™t do this. I 
reme mber he took the man™s 
hand and put it in the door 
and crushed his fingers. And th at was so unl
ik e him, he was not a es Œ he was not a 
bad man, but I thought, my  father, look wh at
 it™s done to him. He actually hurt this 
man, and the Œ the Œ the screami
ng that he broke his fingers. 
Q: Was he there to steal, wa
s that what they  was doing? 
A: He was watch Œ walking along the ledge, 
and, like there, and looking to where Œ 
and I guess he stole some stuff. T o  this da
y I ne Œ I would Œ I Œ 
I saw his face, he Œ 
he mu st have seen me, and I put the bl
anket over my  head, that™s just another 

memo ry of mine. And I Œ I Œ he Œ he was 
found out, I don™t know how, they  found 
the stuff on him. But I reme
mb er thinking I could never love my  father like I used 
to. How could he do this to another human
 being? So  I was convinced this Œ it did 
change my  father, it did change my  mo th
er. And from there on, th e quota Œ oh I, we 
almo st Œ the quota opened up, we couldn™t go to 
Israel
 because the British wouldn™t 
allow us in, and he was just a tailo r. They
 took the doctors, 
the lawyers to the 
U.S.
 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino

33
And they had dozens of tailors, th at was 
the Œ the mo st common profession. Even 
though he was a designer, it didn™t matter, th
at was his trade. And ironically en ough, 
I Œ somehow or other, we were playing spin
 Œ I don™t know, I sat on the botto m of a 
bottle, and I still got the scar. And my pa
rents were horrified because there was a 
chance we could go and Œ not to th e 
U.S.
, but 
Canada.
 And there were Œ there was 
no penicillin and if it was infected, and I re
member my mother tr
ying to hide, cause 
it was in the bone, it was right in the knee
. How we found out, my brother says, why 
is the grass around you red?
 And then when  I stood up, my  whole leg on my  left 
knee was cu t. And instead of Œ I didn'
t understand wh at was happening to my  
parents, instead of, oh my  God, are you a
ll right, it was, we™ll never get out of here 
now. Ou r chances of getting out of here 
Œ and I thought, oh my  God, I Œ they  Œ 
they™re not gonna allow my  parents to get out of there because of me and I Œ wh at do 
I do? And somehow or other she camoufla
ged it, I don™t know how. And we did, 
an d  my  n e xt me mo ry  is
, I guess there were an 
X
 amount of people, some went. If 
you had family in the
 U.S.
 and they were willing to take
 you in, and you were clean, 
at Œ as my pictures show, an
d you had to make sure that 
you were healthy, and they 
were petrified that they™re gonna find th at
 I have this cut on Œ bad cut on my  knee. 
And we were allowed to go Œ 

Q: To the 
U.S.

34
A: Œ to Œ no, to 
To ronto ,  Cana da
 was the only one. We had family in 
New York
, 
but sadly enough, th e one in 
New York
 didn™t Œ I don™t Œ somehow or other didn™t 
want to help, or wh
atever. We ended up in
 Toronto, Canada. 
That wasn™t pretty Œ 
Q: Did you have family there? 
A: No. That wasn™t pretty 
either. The Jewish Federation helped brin g you over. And 
when  we got to 
To ronto ,  Cana da
, my mother Œ well, w-with Œ the boat was 
horrible, because I remember everybody Œ 
I remember my father was so sick. We 
were a great Œ the name of the ship was
 Sa ma ria
 and the ship has since, I guess, 
gone under. But I remember we were, the 
DP 
people who were transported 
To ro nto ,  Ca na da
, we were at the botto m where, 
you know, they  put the coals and 
all, but we were grateful. We were getting out of 
Germany
, and they, you know, 
when you go to 
America
 or 
Ca nada  Œ 
Q: 
Austria. 
A: Œ or au  Œ you™re gonna live. So  it didn™t
 matter if a rat ran ove
r you or what have 
you, and there was, whatever they didn™t 
eat upstairs they thro
w downstairs. But it Œ 
what I do rememb er is how green and horribl
e and sick my mother was. And I really 
thought she was gonna die, my  mother wa
s gonna die, because it was just Œ it was 
just inhuman. But we made it, an d from ther
e we Œ it was still not pretty, we got to 
To ro nto ,  Ca na da
 and we actually stayed in Œ on 
Kensington 
Street. I remember

how awful that was, because 
it™s the only place that Œ the 
Jewish Federation gave us 
clothing, and I said Œ I Œ I found out I Œ gave us clothing, gave us shelter. We ended 
up staying th-the Œ the front of the house 
was where they Œ they
 killed the chickens, 
kosher chickens and there was blood, and I 
thought, oh God. And it was a Jewish 
school, and I reme mb er it Œ I forgot their names. It was an older lady and a 

wonderful couple. And all they could offe
r us was during the day Œ it was a Hebrew 
school Œ we could sleep there at night, but 
we had to vacate, and all they could offer 
was the floor. We were grateful, and that 
I remember, the four of us slept on the 
floor at this Hebrew school at night, but
 during th e day we had to  vacate it. And I 
remember the smell of the chickens and 
the blood from the chickens, thinking to 
myself, we really didn™t surv
ive. Those chickens, I Œ as 
a child I remember thinking, 
this is what the Germans were doing, and th
ey™re doing this to chickens. Well, from 
there we moved Œ 

Q: Can Œ can I stop a little bit here? 
A: Sure. 
Q: Want to go back to a co
uple of Œ couple of things. 
A: I™m sorry. 
Q: Two question Œ no, 
no, no, you™re doing fine. I kn
ow it™s hard. I know it™s hard. 
You talked about how you 
saw your parents change.

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Do you have a sense 
of yourself as a child
, and how you ch anged? 
A: How I changed? My  parents ch anged,
 b ecau se I rememb er my  mo th er Œ  my  
father was a designer and we were wealt
hy. My mo ther, in a way, was spoiled, 
because there was always money there. And 
suddenly Œ now that 
you bring that up, 
the only job they Œ we had to pay back Je
wish Federation, and I rememb er hearing 
my  mo ther saying Œ you know, 
I know now that all these  do
nations that we give to 
the Jewish Federation, maybe it™s different 
now, and th ey work ed Œ they were able 

to work in the delicatessen store. My fath er never did co ld cuts, ne Œ my  mo ther 

never really worked, other than tailoring. 
And oh how he hated it. It was not his 
trade. And then it actually became comical,
 because the little bit 
they made, half of 
his salary, say if he got 10 dollars, five ha
d to go back to  the Je
wish Federation. We 
know for a fact the clothes were donations
. And I™m not putting down the Jewish fe 
Œ but every single paycheck, they had to
 pay back. And we wore hand-me-down 
clothes. I do remember this wonderful, wo
nderful teacher, and 
we moved Œ we had 
six moves in one year, til they managed to
 save some money. And it was made 
known th at whatever we give you, and put 
you up, you will pay, and th ey did. But I 
reme mb er finally going to school Œ and I 
knew how to speak ei

now I™m eight years old, but you Œ a ch
ild picks eight Œ I was able to speak 
Romanian Œ fluent Yiddish , Romani
an, Yiddish, little bit of German. 
Q: Language at home, was it Yiddish? 
A: Oh, it was Yiddish Œ Ro manian. 
Q: So, what Œ your earliest Œ 

A: And then it became Œ 

Q: Œ  memo ries was Ro man ian ? 
A: Romanian, only Romanian. Being in 
DP 
camp, we learned Yiddish, because it 
was the mu tual language, and other dialec
ts. But there were al
so Polish, so, you 
know, it became 
[speaks foreign lang uage]
. You pick  up. And th en, a lot of the 
kids were Russian. They picked  up Romani
an, I picked up Œ and the advantage of 
this is it opened up a lot of doors in my late
r life, because I was able to go to school 
and use those languages, so it did Œ oh Œ  
Q: Well, a child™s like a spon
ge wh en it comes to language. 
A: Yes, yes. And Œ but, we 
made our way with Mom and Da
d, and we got to school, 
and when  we got to school Œ 

Q: Was this the first 
school you™d got to? 
A: I™d Œ I™d Œ I didn™t mention one thing 
which I should have. The other way that 
way back I survived, 
my  mo th er pu t me in
 parochial school.

Q: When ?

A: This was way back in 
Ia
i, 
I forgot to say that. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Cause I remember the nuns 
boc Œ he Œ with the f Œ the 
Œ the Œ the rulers and Œ and 
they found lice in my  hair too, then. But th
at Œ that™s just clicked in, I should have 
said it earlier.  

Q: So you mu st have been 
a kindergartner in parochial

A: Oh yes, oh yes, but it di
dn™t matter. If I was in parochial school I was safe, and I 
didn™t Œ 
Q: Have to wear the yellow star. 

A: My mo th er, somehow or other Œ yeah, 
th at just popped into Œ that™s probably 
another way I survived, or, 
you know, and I™m sure my  brother did, too. Bu t I do 
remember that ruler coming 
down on my  knuckles. But, 
back to present, they 
couldn™t Œ 

Q: Did you Œ the question 
of how did you change. 
A: How did I change? I think I became Œ my
 brother always took care of me. There 
were a lot of other things I probably 
didn™t have, but he Œ i Œ he Œ hi-his

responsib ility Œ death would have gotten to  
him unless he to Œ his job was to take 
care of me. And he did as be
st as I could, but I rememb
er getting in to fights, which 
was not my nature. But the kids, I guess, 
were making fun of Œ 
I couldn™t Œ I could 
speak all these other languages, and the te
acher, of course, all loved me. Couldn™t be 
Œ didn™t Œ didn™t know where to
 place me, because
 so much school was missed. And 
somebody called me, I don™t know if it wa
s dirty Jew or something, and I-I just 
jump ed on her, oh, I Œ I wa Œ i-it wa Œ just 
wasn™t Œ the anger came out of me like an 
animal, and I remember my brother peeli
ng me off of this girl. And I remember 
going to  the principal™s office, or somebody.
 And they  Œ I couldn
™t speak to them, I 
couldn™t tell them. And, the 
[indecipherable]
 came down, and he said, why did you 
do it? And I remember yelling, I™m Jewish, 
I™m Jewish. And that™s the only part I 
remember is, I™m Jewish. Bu
t the girl didn™t do it because I was Jewish, but I 
couldn™t understand why sh e was picking on 
me, and ma king fun and laughing. So 
the answer, it did, it hardened me. And ev
en  though my  brother was to look after 
me, I realized that it™s time to look after my se
lf, this is going to happen. And I™ll just 
have to fill my own shoes, because he™s tw
o years older, he™s now in another grade, 
and this is life. This is life, and we™re 
very lucky, and you know, I can™t be his 
responsib ility and actually it started to take
 hold, and I made my own friends and 
learned the language faster then, and sk ip
ped two, three grades. Fortunately, I guess

I had a brain because it start Œ they didn™t
 know where to put me. They started off 
with first grade, and then I think the la
st was third grad e. And then  fourth  Œ by 
fourth grade, I remember by then I was sp
eaking English, made my  friends, gave my  
brother a breathing ro om where he could go 
with his friends. But it made me bitter. 
Bitter, not Œ definitely bitter against the Ge
rmans, which, they weren™t Œ it made me 
very Œ to this day I have 
no love, and you can™t blame th
e whole, and I mean, I hate 
the language. And ironically enough, ev en as
 I got a job in  public health nursing and 
put my self through school, I used th e 
German lan Œ I had to use the German 
language to be in a clinic, to 
interpret to German refugees in 
To ro nto ,  Ca na da
, o f  
what to do with their babies
. And a couple of times, I 
literally messed up, and I 
knew I messed up, an d I didn™t even, God forg
ive me, resent it. I really didn't Œ I 
didn't  feel bad ab out Œ not that I told her th
e wrong thing, I just said to her, in Œ in 
German, can™t understand, na Œ na 
[German]
 fa Œ you know, mixing Jewish with Œ 
and they  Œ it™s like I Œ I guess my  best way 
of inter Œ I mi xed the ger Œ Jewish with 
the German deliberately. I wanted them 
to know I™m a Jew, and I™m helping you 
speak this language for your baby. What
 did you do fo r us? That™s where I was 
wrong. But that™s Œ I Œ I can actually sa
y from there on, I feel very fortunate. 
Q: I want to stop agai

A: Sure.

Q: But you had mentioned ear
lier that something had happen
ed to your mother, that 
she had fallen down stairs. Ge Œ wh
at™s Œ what was this episode? 
A: That must have happened either after 
I was born Œ all I know is the Ho locaust, or 
the Germans were paying fo r the people that
 went thro ugh th e Ho locaust, and it was 
making retribution. 
Q: Retri Œ reparations. 

A: Right. And there were paintings and stu
ff, and what have you, which were either 
burnt, we had no idea. As I remembe
r, her being interviewed, this is in
 Cana da
, to 
go to 
New York
, and my father, and to be interviewe
d so that if you are eligible for 
this. And I remember she did, and my fath
er did. My father, for some reason they 
said Œ and he was beaten up many times, 
I think, I can™t remember, b ecause they 
said he Œ he™s mentally unbalanced, of 
wh at he™s saying. My mo ther got some 
retribution. 

Q: Re-Reparations. 
A: Rep Œ yeah, I keep making 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: It™s okay. 
A: But my father didn™t. Wh
ether it™s possible he Œ I don™t know. I Œ I really don™t 
know why, because in all honesty, he su
ffered more. But I remember she did, and 
the story went, which I was too young, is
 she was pregnant and she was thrown

down  the stairs and lost the baby. And of 
co urse, the other things that happened to 
us, with the running, the house was destr
oyed Œ excuse me Œ and she got some kind 
of, I guess, pension. No t for long, but sh
e is Œ she was eligible, but I couldn™t 
understand Œ then, we were to
ld, both my  brother and I, that we too. And this is my  
second marriage. And I did marry a Jewish 
gentleman who I met my first time, first 
year out of nursing school, anyway, and 
was married to a Jewish man for 20 Œ 
almo st 28 years, had my three beau tiful da
ughters. And at the time I was living in 
Connecticut,
 and my  brother Œ my  mo ther and fa
ther moved to be with me, cause 
they weren™t getting along with  my  sister-in-law, but it doesn™t matter, they wanted 
to be close. And that was fine, we br
ought them over. And she was getting some 
money wa Œ and I rememb er my  brother 
said, you know, you 
gonna go. And my 
husband said, go. And I says well, I™ll gi
ve them a call. And I think I spoke to 

someone on the phone, if I 
remember correctly. This Œ 
we™re going back, I would 
have been married 50 years. And they said
, you have to  speak 
German and you have 
to go through all this. And I said, you 
know what? There™s no mo ney you can give 
me to bring back these memo
ries, I don™t want to go th rough it, not th en. And my  
brother, to this day, because 
Cara
(ph) called him, and das Œ my  husband is Œ we just 
went to a 
Ba r Mitzv ah
, and I said, 
Mo rris,
 how can you not reme mb er? I™m Œ he

and I are the only su rvivors, my  mo m a
nd dad passed away. And he says, I don™t 
want to remember it, I don™t 
even want to talk about it. 
Cause she did call him, and Œ 
Q: And so he™s never give
n his testimony to anybody? 
A: No, and he doesn™t want to. And he pr
obably rememb ers more th an me, but he Œ 
he wants to forget it, he says, I don™t want 
to reme mb er it. And I Œ I didn™t want to 
push it because I saw him welling up. And I™
m not Œ the reason I™m doing is, I have 
that gentleman, my  husband to  thank, cause
 I had these few pictures, and I do have 
more at home, and I was treasuring them. An
d, ironically enough, to end the story, 
my  husband said to me, look, the pictures
 are gonna just crumble up and they ™re 
gonna get lost. Have them, you know, put 
them in the Holocaust
, and you know. So 
I did, and I™m glad I did, because ironica
lly enough, then a letter came, and I wrote 
my little story, and my grandd
aughter, which I™m very proud to say, and that™s the 
reason I™m here, says, Grandma,
 can I use your paper and ta
lk about your experience 
in that Œ the Holocaust? And I said ab
solutely, and she used
 that and got an 
A 
plus in 
her Œ and th en I went to speak to 90 Œ 90 ki
ds, three classes of sixth graders, and my  
two grandchildren were there, all big-ey
ed, looking at me, proud as punch, and I 

thought, there is a reason. And I really th
ank my  husband for this, because the story 
has to be told, it did happen, and the ki
ds should know. My Œ my  grandson, who 
lives in 
Florida
 will be here December Œ no, April, he was chosen, he™s very gifted.

on, and sees some of the pi
ctures, the story will go on. 
I may not be here, but the story should be told . 
Q: I™m very Œ we™re in a Œ I hope y
ou don™t think we™re finished, unless you Œ 
because I have Œ 

A: No. 

Q: Œ many mo re questions.

 I have to get off my chest. 
Q: Yeah, yeah, I Œ yes, and Œ and thank you for Œ

ad, but I never Œ no. 
It™s not that I™m ashamed of it Œ 
Q: Of course not. 
A: Œ it just Œ so, I think, gruesome. Very gruesome. 
Q: Well, you know, if Œ 

A: I told my husband so me of that. 

Q: But if you were my  mo m, I would be
 crying along with you because I would Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ be thinking, my mom is a little gi
rl, an d she has all this happen to her? 

A: I think th ey know, and 
I don™t think Œ my Œ my fi

that we were foreigners for so
me reason, I don™t know why. 
Q: He was an American Jew? 

A: He was an American Jew. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And I guess the story goes, you know, you come to 
America,
 golden  land, but 
we work ed for everything, nobody Œ my
 family had nothing to  give us. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But that™s the wonderful part, we made it 
the hard way, and we™re here. As far as

ever heard all that I ju st told you.
 Certain parts, that we were in 
DP
 camp and what 
have you, it™s like maybe they didn™t want to
 put Œ it could be they  didn't want to put 
me through telling this. But, wh
en I told them, they were ve
ry, very excited that I am 
telling the story. And as I said to my daugh
ter, when you do go, and you really want 
to hear, because she™s never heard, this is
 my  middle daughter, press the button. Or 
go see the archives. 

Q: Well, we™ll give you a copy of the inte
rview, that you™ll be 
able to share with 
them, if you want to. 

A: What happens to this? 

Q: Well, what happens to this is 
that, this is a digital recorder. 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: And once it™s Œ once we stop, it has a little
 card in it. The card then gets put into 
another gizmo Œ you™re gonna hear my  te
chnolo Œ technologica
l knowledge here, 
it™s this thing, gets connected to  my  com
puter, or some body™s computer here, gets 
transferred there. And then there™s a proc
ess which we™ve just started, because we 
con Œ we were still doing cassette when we
 did audio, up until 
maybe a year and a 
half ago, we were still recording thin

ile, even though it du 
Œ it™s not that long

metimes th ere are interviews that have

them. But Œ but wh en you come here, in a number of 

months, one would be able to ask, at the de
sk that we pass by, the archives desk, I™d 
like to have the interview with

it has our record group numb er

t time she will hear it. 

Q: Oh my, oh my. 

A: Well, you know, if Œ 
Q: I have a Œ I have a few Œ okay , you want to just say something? 
A: Sure, no, go ahead. No, no, I was just going
 to say is, if you ask, you™re told. I™ve 
learned one thing, th ere™s just 
so much you can tell a child. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And there™s certain things I Œ I wouldn™t
 Œ I don™t want it to be gruesome. It™s 
part of history, but I™ve always said to
 them is Grandma, Grandpa, myself and 
Morris
 are so lucky, we never got Œ and I still
 feel that w ay, we never got to go to 
Dach au
. We have friends that their children 
were killed, and they did experiments 
on them. I mean, there were 
a lot of people who my  parents stayed close to, that 
were horror stories. I says, we™re alive, and 
the four of us were spared, that we have 
Œ we™re very fortunate. So that™s where 
I let it go. If they ask mo re, I would have 
told them more.

Q: Well, you know, it™s Œ it™s a funny thing,
 because there are contradictory truths, 
yes? One could say that. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: But look at what Œ but that doesn™t 
mean you didn™t suffer. 
That doesn ™t mean 
you didn™t Œ 
A: Oh yeah, it™s changed me, but it™s also
 ma de me stronger, where I can actually 
say Americans, Canadians don™t know. It happened . 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It was a horrible thing, and it does Œ you
 can either Œ it™s like life, you either lay 
down  and let it take you over, or you get 
up, you brush yoursel
f off and you go on, 
and how Œ I Œ I chose 
to brush myself off. Not just th
ere, after a bad marriage to o Œ 
Q: Of course. 

A: Œ but ye Œ this is life. And that™s one 
of the things I Œ I will treasure, because I 
saw it and it added to  my  life, and I think made me stronger. 
Q: I want to go back to your parents. 
A: Sure. 

Q: We™re back in Œ in
 Toro nto, 
your father™s work ing in Œ in the delicatessen, which 
is not his. 

A: When we first arrived. 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino  
October 15, 2009 

 

 
 
50
Q: Yeah, wh en you first arrived. Did he 
Œ wh at happened with them, and did they 
ever change back to the pa
rents you origin ally knew? 
A: No, no. My Œ my father a
nd mother worked in the deli
catessen til Œ they hated it, 
but it was the only way Œ the on
ly job. Eventually, he went
 back to his tailoring, and 
my  mo ther work ed to o, and that was one 
thing that bothered 
my dad, because she 
only wo rked  with him, and was able to go 
back into the tailori
ng and worked there 
and made a nice living at it. And after year
s of slowly, after all these moves, they 
bought a house Œ 

Q: In 
To ronto . 
A: Œ and Œ in
 Toronto, Canada
, and it was on 
Essex
 Street, and that™s where I 
became a person. We had a house. We did rent the upstairs, we didn™t have a Œ a 

penny, but I actually Œ I went to grammar 
school during th e day, made sure my  
grades were done. It Œ it was different in my 
time, that I told the kids. I had school to 
do, nobody cared whether I went to school, got 
As, Bs
 or
 Fs. 
My job, unlike my 
brother now, the story reversed, I was to 
cook, I was to clean. He was a boy, he 
could do whatever. So I went 
to elementary school there, 
Essex
, and had a job, I 
think I was 11, and work
ed with my girlfriend 
Marcy™s 
father™s store after school. 
Went to work there, but befo
re I could do that, I had to 
clean and do whatever, cook. 
My mother bought me a little stool and I 
could mix the soup and what have you.

And that was my resp onsibility, so the shoe
 reversed, my brother had the freedom, 
but I became the housekeeper. And I kept
 my grades up, my teachers were 
wonderful. Learning was 
a wonderful thing for me, and working made me 
independent, and bought my  own bicycle, 
ma de friends and my  father and mo ther 
stayed in
 Ca na da
 and we lived there.
 Then we upgrad ed. 
Q: Was it a warm family, even
 though they  had changed? 
A: No, the marriage, no. They
 argued a lot, and was mos
tly money. It was not the 
same people that I remembered, but I just 
figured the hardship Œ there was arguing, 
arguing and it was mo stly money. And we supposedly  moved up to
 Shepherd
 
Avenue
 
because of me, so that th Œ you know
, I would meet better people and get 
married, because at 16 they 
were convinced I was gonna 
be an old maid. And as it 
turned out, at 18, I was married. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: Yeah, met my  husband and at 18 I was ma
rried. At the age of 20 I had an ectopic 
pregnancy, was told I couldn™t have kids, 
but fortunately I did. And then Œ now I™m 
in 
Connecticut
 and had my  three beautiful daught
ers, I don™t know if I™m jumping. 
And my parents came to live with us Œ with

A: I was now the keeper. 
Q: I see. 
A: And I have been since the age of 12. 

Q: Wow. 
A: You know, a lot of arguing, wh en you sa
y changed, a lot of arguing. They loved 
each other deeply, but it 
was just a turbulence, 
a lot of turbulence. 
Q: It was too much for them. 
A: Too much for them, yeah, I think it 
got caught up, and ev
en  though slowly, 
slowly they made their way into , you kn
ow, my  mo ther stopped working, my  dad 
was still w o rking, they weren™t happy. Th
en my brother got married, I was Œ moved 
to
 Connecticut. 
They  were unhappy, so finally my  husband said, let™s bring them 
here. And we did, and he opened up a 
little tailoring, cleaning and tailoring, did

extremely well. And I took care of them. A
nd then, as time went on, my  dad started 
to get 
Alzheimer™s
 and things got Œ and I Œ I was the keeper, I Œ 
Q: You kept it together. 
A: Every se Œ oh, yes, yes. My kids say 
you were the matriarchs
, and I Œ yeah, yeah, 
I actually can™t say that Œ my girlfriend al
ways says my  hands are like 90 year old. 
But I did the cleaning, the cooking, what 
have you and I™m Œ I b Œ I didn™t Œ she 
didn™t really want to do this, I Œ I thin
k she was Œ my  mo ther was a bright wo man, 

who ha Œ probably never really
 should have had kids, bei
ng that she loved learning, 
she loved business. And my  father was mo re the caretaker. That™s the best way I can 
describe it. And I was close, he was a wo
nderful man, I loved 
him deeply. Ended up 
with 
Alzheimer™s
 and could never be separated from 
my  mo ther, he just adored her. 
And the saddest day, probably  almo st as sad 
as the Holocaust, is have to slowly take 

his license away, and then put
 him in a home. Only beca
use what was happening is 
he would wander off. And I 
Œ now I™m Œ I was separate
d from my husband, things 
were tough. But my parents were my 
upkeep, and it got to
 the point where a 
wonderful visiting nurse says, you can™t keep
 doing this, cause I had three kids to 
take care of, and my  parents. And th e kids 
were easier to take care of than my 
parents. But it was difficult, because I thi
nk all of this took a toll on him. And the 
forgetting, but the wander
ing Œ wandering off, 
and we got him the bracelet, the 
I.D.

bracelet and all. It Œ it got tough. Put hi
m in the Jewish convalescent home, and 
Mom had to go there too, because you co
uldn™t separate them. And I watched him 
deteriorate. That was hard. That was, I th
ink the hard Œ one of Œ as hard as the 
Holocaust. 
Q: So you Œ you know, you s
till l oved him, even though Œ 
A: Oh, I adored my dad. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I Œ I loved my  mo m, and I took care of
 my  Œ as my  husband knows, we were 
there two Œ twice a week, three time Œ she wa
s also in a Jewish home, and I da Œ she 
died hold ing my  hand. 

Q: Oh my. 
A: Loved mu sic. I can honestly say I took
 care of the both of
 them, thank God. 
Thank Go d that Œ 

Q: But what an ex Œ 
A: It made me strong en
ough th at I could do that. 
Q: But also, what an example for your girls. 
A: Oh, I hope to God they neve
r have to do what I did. I really don™t. I™ve got long 
term care so that they™ll never have to 
go through what I Œ you know, that was hard. 
Q: It™s tough.

A: That™s hard. 
Q: It™s tough, it™s tough. 

A: It Œ it was very tough. But Œ 
Q: What Œ 
A: Œ again, I Œ 

Q: What years did they pass? 

A: My dad was in his 80s, and my  mo m, 
God bless her, was 93. 93, and I was able 
to give her an incredible 90
th
 birthday party Œ birthday party with 
[indeciphera ble]
 
band, and as mu ch money I could 
[inaudible].
 And a Œ she may na Œ not have been 
the greatest mom, but in my heart,
 I did wh at you can do, and I Œ 
Q: That™s Œ 

A: Œ would do it all over again. Bu t Œ and I 
would not want my  children to ever have 
to do that. It™s too mu
ch of a responsibility. 
Q: Yes, but th-the values are Œ are th
e kinds you want yo
ur kids to see. 
A: Oh, you may Œ yeah, I l
oved her. I mean, I™d have lik
ed her Œ at times I loved 
them.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: And my dad, even  though he was t
ough to live with, he was Œ he was a 
sweetheart. He was a sweetheart. There 
was nothing I couldn™
t ask my  dad, and

56
may b e no t my  mo m. I lo v ed  my  dad .  He wa
s tough to  live with, but I loved my  dad 
because Œ I™ll add one thing, my mom didn™t care what Œ the grades or what have 
you, but that was because she Œ her mother 
had her at 50. It™s a gap, so her mother 
took care of us. But, when I graduated elem
entary school, I had to get, those days, 
like a prom dress. And my mom said, just Œ my father said, I™ll tak e you. It was 

probably  the ugliest dress in the whole pr
om, cause I was short and fat. And Œ but I 
was just so proud that my  dad, not my  
mom, went with me. So, we were close. 
Q: Yeah. Do you ever know what ha
ppened  to  your grandmother, who was Œ 
A: She Œ she died. I never would Œ was ne
ver explained to me, did she died during 
the Holo caust. I reme mb er Œ I don™t rememb er a funeral, I don™t rememb er. So, did 
she die in the bombing? 
It was never brought up. 
Q: And the family, the con Œ 
family compound, was this 
your mother™s family, or 
your father Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: It was your mo th er™s? 
A: No, my mothe
r™s, my mother™s. 
Q: It was family. 
A: My father™s father was a farmer. Two of the mo st wonderful people. She was just 
a tiny little thing. He Œ my father resemb
led, he was the gentlest man, the Œ

Q: Your grandfather. 
A: Œ I think I™ve only seen twice, as young 
as I was. And I know the whole farm was 
big, and I rememb er him milking the cow an
d bringing it to me warm, out of Œ right 
out of the cow. But when th e war broke out, either they
 were killed Œ I know my 
father™s sister, very tragically, th
ere was a movie that was called, the 
brievela
(ph) 
de 
Mama.
 You understand what that mean
s? Letter to your mother? 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And apparently, some fire broke out, 
and she was trampled to death. And her 
name was
 Anutsa
(ph). And my father told me this
. It was just before, I guess, war 
first broke out. And that was tragic. Bey
ond that, I never really knew. I was too 
young. What happened to them, I do
n™t know. His siste r was alive in 
Israel,
 made it, 
but when  war broke out, every Œ ev erybody
 just flew in different direction. 
Q: Another question. How did you choos
e your profession? Wh ere did you Œ 
A: Oh, I had a few. 

Q: Yeah, then Œ you mentioned the nursing. 
A: Supposed to go to
 nursing school, but it didn™t wo rk
 out, because I couldn™t stand 
anything being blood. 
And I was very good with my ha
nds, and very athletic, as my  
mother was. She used to call herself a 
Maccabee, 
which she was in. I Œ I actually

had a multitude of, after I got married, 
would bef Œ before I met my husband I 
w o rk ed  fo r p ub lic h
ealth nurses. And Œ 
Q: Okay . That would have been in 
Canada.
 
A: That would have been in 
Ca nada
. And I did volunteer work at a veteran™s 
hospital up to the age that I got married. 
From about 15, my self and my  friends 
would go every Sunday and cook for the ve
terans. And I remember writing, they 
were parachuters, and all that remained of 
them was just their bo
dies, they were like 
in Œ I don™t know what you call those swi
ngs, you know, it™s just the netting, it™s like 
Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And I remember th ey couldn™t write. And I would write letters to  their 
sweethearts, nobody came to vi
sit them. They gave me tremendous Œ my self and my  
friends, but I loved that. We
 Œ I Œ I loved doing th at. 
Q: It was meaning. 
A: It w Œ it Œ I don™t Œ I can™t Œ I mean, 
at 16 you don™t do th ings like that. There 
were five of us, who we just stel Œ reunited in
 Toro nto, Canada
, and that™s what we 
did every Sunday. And it™s Œ that Œ that wa
s very fulfilling. That
™s the only way I 
can describe it, very fulfilling, and back to 
your question as far Œ then I got married, 
and when  I arrived in 
Connecticut
 I reme mbered all I could d-do Œ I was an

59
excellent typist, so the thin
g to do was transcribe. And 
I applied to  Manpower or 
something, and my  typing was excellent. A
nd ended up doing typing. And then my  
languages opened up doors again. My 
children were born and then  I stopped 
work ing, and my  husband was in the 
printing business. And because of my  
languages, a friend called and says, 
Lili
, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and 
German and a little bit of Russian and Polis
h. There™s a job open
ing at the Jewish 
center for the hot lunch program that consis
ts of like 150 people. You have to do 
programmi ng, it™s quite involved. I said, 
I don™t know, because my  husband didn™t 
want me to work. Went down, I applied, go
t the job, was able to take Œ I was not 
allowed to work unless I brou
ght Œ til my kids were in 
school, home for the kids 
after school, those were the rules. And th
at was fine. So I brought my little one, 

which is my youngest, 
Stacey
 with me, and I reme mb er loving work , just loving it. 
Prior to that Œ oh, after that, I remember 
Œ I thought, okay, I did that, she came with 
me. Now it™s time to put her in a daycar
e and I will put her in a daycare and get 
my self a job. The other two were in sc
hool, and I™ll wo rk around the kids. And 
ironically enough, I went to sign her up, a nd I was sitting on the floor, reading her a 

book til I could get the director. And I had th
ree or four kids on my lap, a couple on 
my back, and I™m reading these books and 
these kids are all over me, and I think, 
what the heck? And she says to me, would 
you Œ well, what™d you
 come here for? 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino

And I says, to sign up my  daughter. And sh
e says, well, I™ve got a better idea. You 
come work for us. You see? So
 I ended up having a full tim
e job, my daughter got in 
free, and I started to work for the daycare. 
After that, I ju st loved working, and I end 
Œ from there, I went to work
 for special ed, as an aide
. And because of my grades 
and what have you, I found 
myself working one on one, 
and I abso lutely loved it. 
And I would go to different
 schools, and there was one, 
you know, some kids were 
wheelchair bound, couldn™t talk, one was 
sign language. And I would wo rk one on 
one Œ one on one with
 them. That was another job. 
After that it was a multitude of 
incredible jobs, I don™t know how I got th
em. Dad had to go, b
ecause now the kids 
were all in school, and I thought, well, 
it™s time to go on. I believe, if I™m not 
mistaken, I worked
 for a bank. And that was again up
 to three o™clock, and be home 
for the kids. From the bank, I thought, we
ll, let™s see what else I can do, I love 
people. I went to work for, 
happen ed to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy. I 
was a wer Œ answered the phone. It™s Œ 
and I ended up giving physical therapy, 
which I didn™t want to do, but she says
, you™ve got some nursing background. I 
ended up doing physical therapy, which I sh
ouldn™t have done. And then, next thing 
I know is this friend of theirs wanted to op
en up this thing, adap
tive clothing for the 
handicapped. And she had Œ that™s
 when Velcro first came in. 
Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino  
October 15, 2009 

 

 
 
61
A: And she said, what do you th ink, 
Lili
? So the one who owne
d the physical, she 
says, I want you to meet this woman who came in, I think it was either 
Las Vegas
, 
or I-I™m not even su
re where she lived, 
califor Œ 
someplace. She was a wonderful 
lady, we hit it off immediately. And sh e 
says, will you work  with me on this, and 
we™ll Œ somehow or other I got
 involved with her, and we op
ened up this thing. But, 
my  husband decided it™s Œ it Œ that™s enough.
 It was every eat Œ 
when I worked for 
the Jewish Center, I was in the paper, beca
use I was talk ing to 
governors and mayors 
and what have you. Wh ether that threat
ened him, I don™t know, and I was in the 
paper, and then when  I ope Œ started with 
th is adaptive clothing fo r the handicapped, 

again it was, you know, ribbon cutting, a
nd that did it, it was just Œ I™m Œ I™m 
exposed, and there™s just too much. So 
then , I think there was another job I was 
applying to, and that was Œ there were Œ 
I loved physical fitn
ess and people, so I 
applied at, I remember, the 
YMCA
 in
 Hamden, Connecticut. 
And I thought, 
there™s no way I™m gonna get it, I mean, this 
is director for Œ and he says, I™m v ery 
interested. And I came home to tell my 
husband th at I™m going to  possibly Œ you 
know, I Œ I interviewed and there™s a good 
chance, that was the 
end of my  married 
life, and wh at have you, and he says, 
no you™re not, you™re coming to wo rk at 
Bro dy
 
Printing Comp any. If you™re so great, you 
can prove it to me. And th at was a bad 
move, because I found the things Œ this
 was not the man I was married to, and 

 
Interview with Lili Brody-Carmosino

working for him was not the things to do b
ecause the way he talked to people and 
handled people is the way he
 hated other people handling 
him, not to get involved. 
And the marriage fell apart. And you ready? I was there with well, not three, 
because my daughter moved out, my olde
st daughter, and sh e went to college, and 
so did th e middle one. And the marriage Œ we went to 
Israel
, my treat. The only way 
the kids went on vacation is if I paid for 
it. And this was a wealthy man, who really 
didn™t like kids, but he wasn™t a bad father, 
he just wasn™t around, so I was basically 
a single mo m anyway . The reason I™m saying 
this, and there is where the Holocaust, 
and my  ex perience is making me what I 
am, I™m grateful for. What does a woman 
do with no credit cards, two ch
ildren, three to take care of, had a beau tiful home, 

went on vacations, now I™m alone, beca
use the silence was deafening, the 
relationship fell apart, and I kept on saying
 Œ you know, I Œ I Œ I Œ I go on vacations, 
I have a beautiful home, three beautiful
 children, what™s 
going on, why am I 
unhappy? There was no co nv
ersation, it was Œ everything fell apart. There was no 
interaction, and I was going in to depressi
on and I ended up div Œ 
taking the family, 
the last hurrah, to
 Israel
, where I met the cousin who sp
lit my head. And there were, 
I think, 12 of us at a tabl
e, and because my  husband was well off at the time Œ and I 
treated, with 7,000 dolla
rs for that trip, and the best trip ever. And we got Œ the kids 
got to see 
Israel.
 I met my Œ the family that was 
left over. And th at Œ that was it,

1985, I went on my  own. Wh en  we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst 
to me, there was somebody
 else for 15 years. 
Q: Oh my. 
A: That was Œ and back in the thing, I had 
to now, no credit cards, no car. What am I 
gonna do? Sold  the house, wh
ich was mine, and went to 
school, and learned how to  
be a court reporter. I worked  in the court system. 
Q: Oh, my goodness. 
A: And that was Œ I became 
very independent, I made 
nice money, and thank you

r Œ up a marriage of almo st 28 years, brush 
myself off, start bu Œ all over again, and m
eet this wonderful man, who may not be

that™s what comes fro
