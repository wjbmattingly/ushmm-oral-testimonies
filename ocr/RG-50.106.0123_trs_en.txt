 The city we lived in it,

We were very good friends with all the

when the rumor got out that th
e Germans are marching toward 
Czechoslovakia

 in Œ in so Œ so me places. Which, I couldn™t 
do that because of my parents being old a

there, that they were 
massacring and Œ and Œ and killin

 Hungary.
 They  sent him back to be

group, and told them what to
 do and when  to do and how 
long to do it, and not the 
Hungarians. It was strictly 
the German Œ it was not the 
SS

A: Horrible. 
Q: How long did it take? 

A: It was so full that if you stretched out
, you couldn™t pull your leg back , or vice 
versa, if you pull it in, it was almo st impo
ssible to put it in there. And every day 
when the train stopped, they opened 
the door and threw the dead bodies out.

water during those three days?

r the simple reason, the worry wa
s so great that it was no time, 
no place to say, how you feel or 
what you think or Œ or what. 
Q: No, no, but the whole situation, I me
an, were you frightened, or were you Œ 
A: The whole situation Œ yes, everybody 
was afraid what Œ you know, there was no 
answer and no question. We couldn™t ask 
because nobody knew 
anything. Because 
like I said, there was no info
rmation as far as the Jewish
 people were in Œ in a 
concen tration Œ or other 
than what we heard in 
Poland
, which it was close to us, 
that there is Germans Œ the 
SS
 was killing Jewish people. But the 
Warsa w
 ghetto 
uprising, we did not her Œ we didn™t hear 
anything. Matter of fact, I don™t think even 
the free world heard anything about it be
cause n-nobody Œ otherwise we would 
have known Œ the 
BBC
 we listened, sometimes at nigh
t they ha Œ talking about the 
war, and we didn™t hear nothing. Noth ing wh atsoever.

Auschwitz
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Can you tell us about it, please? 

A: Yes, they told us to ge
t out. One who could get out, 
because there was still dead 
bodies in the train. And then they sa
id men and boys on 
one side, wo men and 
children on the other side. And as we were
 going, there were overseers, which we Œ 

they called them 
ka pos
 and they  were Jewish people and they said, you see that 
smoke? Do you smell it? And th ey said, th
at™s gas chamber, okay? We didn™t know 
nothing about it, we never even heard ther
e™s such a thing as gas chambers. So he 
said, they™re burning bodies. One who di
ed and one who was killed. And as we 

walked in on the right side 
into the camp, we looked ba
ck and we saw my parents, 
my father, my mother and sist

bricklayer, whatever they™re Œ tell them th
at you know all of it. You are a carpenter, 
you™re a bricklayer, you™re everything. If th
at™s what they ask for it, because they 
didn™t use you what they  asked, they just
 wanted volunteers. And that™s when we 
were shipped out, not that, you know, it 
was a couple weeks later, they shipped us 

out to ow Œ to 
Warsaw
 ghetto.  
Q: Let me backtrack a little b

and children on th e other side
, did they take you Œ did 
you get any prisoners clothes, or Œ

Q: But that was not right wh en you arrived? 
A: Oh, it was in the same day.

Q: How come you an d your father were not put in the male column ? 

A: Because my father was old and had a be

old to Œ you know, to wo rk. He was in his 60™s. 
Q: So your mother and 
father were in one Œ

separated the young ones from the old ones. 

Q: Uh-huh, so there were like three lines.

Q: Where did you sleep? 
A: On th e floor. 
Q: Can you describe? 
A: Ho, you see, there was no 
problem for me for the simple reason, we were a big 
family and we only had three rooms, a k

A: That was home, but we slept on the fl
oor, so I was used to it and Œ and Œ an d 
food, what we ate, sometimes th ere was 
none, it didn™t bother, and that™s why we 
could take the condition, becau
se we were used to it. An
d let™s say this much, that 
we were not picayune about wh at we ate. 
We ate as long as it was food, ed ible and 
good. 

Q: How many people were
 in your cabin at 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Now a Œ that I couldn™t tell you be
cause it was a big cabin and there was 

hundreds of them in there. So I couldn™t
 tell exactly what it wa Œ how many it was.  
Q: Mm-hm. And how often 
did they give you food? 
A: Now they have Œ in Œ in there, in 
Auschwitz
, there was not so bad that th-the Œ 
the Œ a few days that we were over there 
we gave every Œ you 
know, everyth Œ we 
had sometimes once, sometimes twice a day we had fo od.  

Q: How long did you stay in 
Auschwitz
? 
A: No, we didn't  stay too 
long. I mean, I™m not sure ex
actly what it is, but I would 
say, you know, at least between a one mont
h or two months, you know, that™s all. 
That™s wh y we are not tattooed, because they 
said that one who is there four or five 
or six months, they tattooed those people
. Now my friend who was from my area in

Czechoslovakia

mo st eight months. She Œ they put her to

work  in the crematorium and she got the nu
mbers and she told me that Œ that she 
cannot talk to nobo
dy because she saw her mother and father coming down on a 
ramp , dead, and it Œ she explained it why I did not have the wh at you call, the 
tattoo. And after that o ther people told 
me why we don™t, but I have the number. I 
never forg et that, it™s 88841. And my  brother had 8842. 
Q: How come you know your numb er 
and how co me it wasn™t tattooed? 
A: No, tha-that tha Œ 
they gave you th e numb
er on your shirt. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But they didn™t give it to me on my  ha
nd, because like I said, I was a very short 
time there. 
Q: 
[indecipherable] 
only after six months that they wo uld Œ 
A: Yes, then they tattooed. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Neither my sister s a re Œ two sisters ha
ve Œ are tattooed because they were taken 
in a different section. 

Q: Now what did you do Œ did you wo rk in  
Auschwitz
? 
A: Oh yes. Not Œ no, in 
Auschwitz
 we didn™t work, no. In 
Auschwitz
 we just 
stayed in a barrack and always called ro
ll call back and forth just to keep you 
occupied. No, only in
 Warsaw
 ghetto we were working.

u didn™t do no work 
in Œ in the concentration camp? 
A: Not in  
Auschwitz
, we didn™t work, no. 
Q: In 
Auschwitz
. Were you aware of the bodies being Œ 
A: Yes, we saw it Œ one, and we were 
inform by the people already there wh at™s 

going on. They said look, the ch imney, th
e black, the smoke, the smell. That™s 
where they put the bodies, th
ey™re burning it, because th
ere™s no place to put them. 
That™s when we knew that
 that™s a death camp. And 
th at™s all, we couldn™t do 
nothing, so we stayed ther
e on in  the barracks, or Œ outside we couldn™t roam 
around, only wh en th ey called us the roll ca
ll, and they called us quite a few times a 
day. 

Q: And you were the whole time with your brother together? 

A: Yes, mm-hm. 

Q: But you didn™t s

A: No.  

Q: You stayed there fo r four months? 

A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
 ju st in between one or two months. I™m not exactly

the 
ka po
 said, volunteer to get out. So I couldn™t say that Œ no, 
[indecipherable]
 
would say between one or 
Œ or Œ or two months, somewhere around there. 
Q: And when did you find out
 that you were going to  be transferred elsewhere?  
A: No, when  they Œ wh
en they called out for volunteers and the 
ka po
 told me to do 
exactly Œ go and say you are a bricklayer 
or whatever it is. And so my  brother did 
the same thing. I had a brother who was a 
painter, so he said he was a painter, and 
we were accepted. 
Q: And then  what? 
A: And then, in a few days, they 
put us on a train taking us to 
Warsaw
. 
Q: How long was the train ride? 
A: No, I couldn™t describe, but I think we
 made it in Œ i-i-in Œ in one day.  
Q: How were the condition on the train? 
A: That time they gave us food before 
we entered that, you know, the boxcars, and 
then when we got to 
Warsaw
, in be Œ i-in between there they stopped and they gave 
us some water and they told us to get out  and Œ and use a washroom, whatever it is 

and then  we had water. That™s all we had.

 were taken from 
Auschwitz
 to
 Warsaw

Auschwitz
, they Œ 
they changed. They took all Œ everything 
we had, civilian clothes and threw it in 
one box. And then they told
 us to go outside and we 
stayed there naked til they

demo lished and we learned that already in

Q: Oh, can you tell us about it? 
A: Yes. It was quite a few thousand gold
 Œ 20 dollar gold pieces, but you couldn™t 
take it in because the guard or Œ there were
 Œ law was, when you come in, you keep 
the shoes and your belt and 
the clothes you leave it on 
the ground, and the guard 
went thro ugh with it, feeling wh at you 
got in your pock et. So I couldn™t bring 
nothing in til I met a P o lish what th
ey call a work er, who was bringing in 
[indecipherable] 
supplies, whate Œ whatever it 
is, horse and b
uggy. And we 
stopped him and we ask him 
can we get a belt, wide and double thickness. And he 
said oh yes, he said, but it w
ould co st you a 
thousand dollars. 
Q: A thousand dollars? 
A: A thousand dollars, and 
we had paper money, wh ic
h we u Œ we gave him a 
thousand dollars and I put th
e 20 dollar gold pieces in th
e belt, which went in 40 
dollars at a time. 40 20™s, but Œ you know, 
40 gold pieces you could put in th e belt. 
And that™s how I went in to the camp. And 
one guard asked if he
 found anything, he 
would give us bread. So  I 
told him I had Œ I found one
 gold piece, what would I 
get? He said a loaf of bread. And I was 
buying bread fo r a 20 dollar gold piece, a 
loaf of bread, wh ich was enough for my  
brother, my self and my
 brother-in-law who

A: You could not Œ you could not, other than
 in the, what you call, barracks, you 
could talk to each other. Ou
tside you could not get a Œ 
an Œ an Œ and form like a 
group. You couldn™t do that, that was not 
allowed. Inside, yes, but you couldn™t 
form no group. On ly th ing we
 did is people were trying to do is make up a Œ wh at 
you call a song and do Œ keep  
us what you call, happy. 
Which we learned that few 
of them, I don™t know if you ever heard about it 
[speaks foreign language here]
. 
Did you ever hear about it? 
Q: Oh yes. 
A: Okay then. And that™s what we were 
singing all the time. And it kept us a little 
bit mo re excited and the feeling as Œ as 
otherw ise, you know, it would be just the 
other way around, would drag you down, 
but that song really kept us going. 
Q: And how long di
d you stay in 
Warsaw
? 
A: In the 
Warsaw
 we stayed til about September or
 October, because we heard the 
rumor also Œ rumor, that the 
Russians are closing in on 
Poland, 
getting closer and 
closer to 
Warsaw
. So they told us
 to get together and take

A: That was in September or Oc
tober, somewhere around there. 
Q: In the autumn. 
A: Yeah, in the autumn, you know.  
Q: And you started to walk. 

A: Yes, we walked. And as we were walk
ing, people were falling out. If he was 
alive, he was shot. If he pretended he wasn™t alive, he was shot anyway to make it 

sure that he was dead. 

Q: Did you know which directi
on you were walking to wards? 
A: No, they told us we™re walking toward 
Germany
, that™s all we knew. And I 
didn™t know 
Poland
 or
 Warsaw
, anywhere, which way we go
ing. All I knew is that 
we were walking to ward 
Germany
. 
Q: How many days did you walk ? 
A: I couldn't tell you that, 
but it was quite a few days. 
Q: How many hours a 
day did you walk? 

 
Interview with William Klein

36
A: From sunlight to almost darkness. Some
times we sto pped earlier and just like the 
man was saying, we were using wh atever 
y Œ tools you had to 
make a hole and get 
some water out of th e field to drink 
it because there was no water. And if you 
walked on the main 
line, there was the sewer Œ not, I wouldn™t say sewer, but water 
drainage, and Œ and we used to drink 
water. Whether it was clean or dirty or 
infected, we didn't think ab out it, nor did 
we care about it. All we knew because we 
were thirsty. And th en one time, one Œ one
 time we got to a water and we just ran 
into the water and Œ clothes and all and dr
inking and Œ an-and bath
ing and just name 
it, we did in the water. Then they wa Œ so
me of them wanted to
 swim away from it, 
and they were killed in the water. We got out
 of it, and I think that was the last time 
that we had water that I know
 of, is when we were at th
e river. And then we walked 
about a couple more days. An
d they  said pretty soon we going to  go into a Œ no, I 
think Œ I think we were about Œ I woul
d say about maybe three or 400 mi Œ 
kilometers we walked. Then 
they put us on the train. 
Where it was, I couldn™t tell 
you. 
Q: When you were walking, until they pu
t you on the train, 
did you come across 
villages or little towns?  
A: No, we did not, we used strictly the 
roads. There was never villages or towns, 
never.

Q: So you didn™t see any 
of the local population? 
A: None wh atsoever, no, none wh atsoever. 
Q: Who gave you fo od to eat? 
A: Whatever they Œ what you call th-the trucks or cars were bringing it out there, 
what little it was, because you know, I Œ 
I was told there was 11,800 people that 
walking. 

Q: 11,000 people? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: All of them from th e 
Warsaw 
Œ 
A: Ghetto. I mean, there was also other 
buildings, you know, other than ours. And 
th-that™s what they told us
. Now, I cou Œ I-I only go what
 people said and Œ and we 
were Œ arrived very few of th
em in Œ in what you call, 
Dachau
. 
Q: Now, before we get there, how did 
people react to one another during this 
march? Were they helping each other? 
A: Yes, my self and my  brother was hel-he
lping a-an older gentleman who so  Œ who 
Œ it just so happened  he was a rabbi and we 
carried him so long, so
 far. After that he 
could not even walk 
and we dragged him a little bit, 
but he just fell down and you 
couldn™t bend down 
and try to help him, cause they
 would kill you the same way. 
And so we walked, and 
I Œ we heard a shot.

Q: Okay, we were Œ we were talk
ing about your marching from Œ from
 Warsaw
 
towards 
Germany
, and I asked you if people were
 helping each other and ju s Œ 
A: Yes, e-e-everybody, you know, who Œ w
ho needed some help, they had an arm, 
you know and Œ and try to 
support him by walking. One 
who could not, like I said, 
fell down Œ 
Q: Œ Fell down. 
A: Œ and you could not do anything, we had 
to just walk and l
eave him behind. And 
I heard Œ this is just what I said, I hear
d that only about 11 Œ 1800 or 2800 surv ived  
and all the rest of them died on th e way.
 This is what people told us. Now, I 

couldn™t say wh ether I counted them, because
 I didn™t, you couldn™t do that. But I 
just going by them and Œ and like the gentle
man said, that he Œ you know, wh en he

180 people survived . No w I Œ I Œ I couldn™t

A: Œ there was 18 Œ 180 people surviv ed. 

Q: Out of how many? 

A: Of 11,000. 
Q: 11,000, my  goodness. How did peopl
e feel during that march? I mean Œ 
A: You know, we wasn™t talking to each othe
r, other than what™s 
going to happen to 
us, and many times you were thinking abou
t just hide in the bushes, maybe some 

Polish farmer, or Polish partisans will come
 and help. And Œ but
 nobody was daring 
enough to do that because, 
like I said, some people wanted
 to do it in the water, and 
they shot them. So everybody was afraid
 to do anything, and I wa Œ just so 
happened  I was with my  brother and I just
 couldn™t take a chance on anything. We 
figure we gonna surv ive one way or th
e other. And thank God we survived .

Q: For how many days did you walk? 
A: I couldn™t tell exactly b
ecause you know, that time, 
the counting wasn™t there, 
but it was quite a few days, was quite a fe
w days. We slept outside in the cool 
weather, but we slept good because we b
undled up among each, you know, in stead 
of being just one or two of them, was 
eight, 10 people got 
togeth er and Œ and 
warmed each other up.  

Q: What was the name  of the town  from which you to ok the train? You don™t 
remember. 
A: Like I said, we were not even close to 
the town so we couldn
™t even see what it 
was.  
Q: Ma Œ  
A: The on Œ the only thin
g we knew, that we saw some build ings, but wh ere or 

what, I couldn™t tell. Nobody, I mean anybody
 was on that trip, could tell you what 
the town™s name is. 
Q: And so you got on th
e train, how lo ng was the train 
ride? This Œ this train ride to
 
Dach au

A: I would say from Œ tha Œ to

 was a couple of days. 
Q: And how was your physical
 health during that period? 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
41
A: Mine was good because as a kid I wa
s a hard work er and Œ and Œ and good 
condition, because we were working all da
y and so my physical
 condition was good 
because I was used to hard life at h o me, lik
e I said, we lived that way. And so I had 
no problem in that respect. Many people ar
e Œ were passing out because they had no 
Œ also I, as a Œ as a young man I was a s
portsman. I was a soccer player, I was a 
runner and so on, so I was 
in good condition in that re
spect, and so was my  brother. 
But other people was with us, they  were ju
st falling out. Naturally, some were older 
than we are. We were that Œ you know, 
I was Œ that was what, about 20 years old, 
and so I wa Œ I Œ like I said, in
 my prime, in that condition. 
Q: I meant to ask you wh
en you went from Œ from
 Užhorod
 to Œ to 
Auschwitz
 Œ 
A: 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: Œ and then from 
Auschwitz
 to 
Poland
 and now to 
Dachau
, were you the whole 
time with the same people that left
 Užhorod 
with you? 
A: No, not the same people. There was Œ you 
see, in Œ in that train was other than 
Užhorod. 
There was surrounding areas 
and they brought them 
also into the camps, 
so let™s Œ I would say su rrounding area, yes.
 And th at™s Œ that™s the people who was 
there. 
Q: And these are the people th
at eventually you got to 
Da cha u
? 
A: Yes, mm-hm.

Q: Tell us about
 Da cha u
. 
A: Now, in 
Dachau Œ 
Q: Tell us when  you arrived there, and Œ 
A: When we arrived to 
Dachau
, there was people greeting us and some of them 
said welcome to death camp. And I said, 
what camp? He said, death camp. Well, I 
didn™t know what he is talking about it 
til I found out, you see that chimney over 
there? He said that™s where 
all the people wind up wh
o stays in here. Well, we 
didn™t know nothing, they gave us a bed, 
and they allowed us to
 go in a bath house. 
Warm, hot water bath. And then they said
 if e Œ you know, we gonna have some 
food in the kitchen Œ whic
h, they  gave us food. 
Q: Who were the people who greeted you in  
Da cha u
? 
A: Prisoners. 

Q: So the prisoners told
 you it was a death camp? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were the prisoners Jewish, or Œ 
A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: No. 
Q: They were mixed?

A: He was a Œ a Œ a Œ what you call a pr
eacher I wasn™t sure, a Catholic, or 
whatever it is, but that was a preacher, cause
 he still had that collar, only the collar 
on his neck. Otherwise he had th e same st
riped uniform, you 
know, and Œ and he 
greeted us and he said I™m not Jewish, he said
 Œ he told us right 
away that he wasn™t 
Jewish. There was many over there i-i-in a 
religious group that were arrested by th e 
German government. 

Q: All right, so tell us some more about 
Da cha u
. 
A: And then we st Œ like I said, we stay ed a few days, I™m not so sure how long 

because we were so tired, and 
Œ and as Œ a Œ if they allowe
d us, we were just laying 
and sleeping. Then one day they  called 
and they said, wh ere anybody wants to 
volunteer to go wo rk in  Œ in th e underg round factory Œ building, a factory. An d no 

one experien ced wh at the man in Œ in 
Auschwitz
 said, the first th
ing you do is get 
out a ca Œ a death camp. And exactly that™s
 what we did, and we got to a small 
town, what they call 
Mildorf
(ph). And from 
Mildorf
(ph) we had to walk to the 
camp, which was in the forest, I woul
d say maybe five, no mo re than eight 
kilometers from there, a
nd they  had the cabins. You know, I Œ we call them 
bunkers, cause all it w as i-is Œ is a r
oof over it and concrete, everything else 
concrete. The place that you sleep and Œ an
d sit, or whatever, or walk, it was 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
44
nothing but concrete. And we stayed ther
e a few days you kn
ow, til they took us 
working out the camp. 
Q: Outside of 
Mildorf
(ph)? 
A: Outside of 
Mildorf
(ph), yeah, that was also outside 
Mildorf
(ph). There was an 
underground factory they were
 building, and we were Œ 
Q: And what were they doing there? 

A: We didn™t know that because it was ju
st in the process of building that Œ the 
place up. And what it is Œ was, that peopl
e were standing on steel, what you call Œ 

Q: Beams? 

A: Œ platform, or Œ or Œ or shape, then 
we poured concrete. And if you were not 
careful and you fell in there, the conc
rete buried you in stantly because it was 
flowing, the concrete, continuously . And it 
Œ that™s the place where I got badly hurt, 
when  a train, a construction train hit me in my chest and ruptured my  ribs, 

punctured my lung and almost killed me. 
But I survived. God, I believed in God, 
and it helped  me. And th ere was one German work er who had a hat on, they  called 

him 
Toten Kopf, 
which translation mean dead  head
. And he helped me with little 
food there was in the underg
round, while I was in the 
camp, in the working camp, 
when  I was going a Œ I Œ I came out every 
day to walk  back because they counted 
the people when they came and 
when they left, make it su
re that there is everybody

there. But every morning when
 we walked there, which was seven days a week  and 
sometimes work ing 12 - 14 - 15 hours a da
y, that™s including in walking and 
everything else, and I was mo st of the tim
e in the bunker, underground and in the 
dark, cause I couldn™t breathe. Finally, I 
got better. And Œ and also it was a problem 
in the camp because they threw me out 
from the barrack becau
se I was moaning 
from pain all night long and I couldn™t Œ th
ey couldn™t sleep and they f Œ they felt 
that they are so tired that 
they just cannot take my, wh
at you call misery and Œ and 
sound, or pain, cause that would have ma
de them mo re s Œ wh at you call vulnerable 
to their Œ to their work a
nd because they were so tired. Even then  we didn't have 
sleep. And many people died there too, in th
e work ing place, if not on the wh at you 
call, on the march. Cause it was, you kn
ow, every day marching to  work  and from 
work  and lunch. Lunch hour was in a sec
tion and we knew what time. When the 
horn sounded, you™re supposed to go to  the 
Œ what they  call a Œ a lun Œ a lunch area. 
And people used to always slowly  wo rk th ei
r way in closer Œ closer to their lunch, 
because if you didn™t, there was just a si
 Œ one hour time you had to feed I don™t 
know how many hundreds of pe
ople. So natural, you were trying to get closer. 
When  you were closer you ran to it if you 
were lucky, you know, and th ey used to 
put in a Œ a ladle in that 
soup, and come out with a pot
ato and he puts it back and 
you get nothing but water. It has one or 
two potatoes in it 
and they showed it 

 
Interview with William Klein

46
everybody else what it is, but never got
 it. But they showed what it was. But 
anything was cooked, what little was in it, 
and it Œ a-and a little bit, it did help. And 
to prove that it did help, I™m here today.  
Q: So you essentially he
lped the Germans build th
is underground factory. 
A: Yes. 
Q: I want to go back to your acci
dent, when that train hit you. 
A: Yes. 
Q: How did it exactly happen? 
A: There was a Russian prisoner who was 
driving that little train. And then he 
wanted to put it in reverse, because he wa
s in a standing position,
 he wanted to put 
it in reverse, and we were ar
ound there. And it, instead of 
reverse, it ju
mped in drive 
and it jumped Œ I was so close to it, that 
the edge of the train hit my  rib, and it Œ 
Q: So it was an accident? 

A: Oh yeah, that was th Œ an
 accident, it was not on purpose 
[indecipherable]
 and I 
still have the thing sticking out over here, 
even though I had th
e operation, they 
removed part of it, not to Œ you know, pu
nctured it. But there was a docto r wh o did 
help me, not an official doctor Œ 
Q: At the time? At th Œ 
A: At the camp, you know Œ 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
47
Q: At mi Œ at 
Misseld orf
(ph). 
A: Ye-Yes, and he said, let me do somethi
ng for you an d he put his hand and pulled 
out the rib. I almo st died in the pain 
from that alone. And he said now, the blood 
started Œ stopped running, as it did befo re
. And like I said, everything, it was just 
work ing my way, bu Œ 
Q: Was it a  Jewish doctor? 

A: Yeah Œ oh yes, he was a prisoner. 
Q: Also a prisoner. 
A: Yes. But like I said, we didn™t have 
no doctors, not offici
ally. We didn™t even  
volunte Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 he was a Jewish doctor from Œ 
A: He was a Jewish doctor from our area, 
yes. And he is the one who pulled it out. 
And people said, you know, they  pronounc
ed  me already dead, and I got up in  the 
broad sunlight and I saw the stars, but I an
nounced that I™m not dead, I™m alive. But 
the blood was just spilling out of my  mout
h. And you know, wh at we saw in movies 
and all that, a-all the time, when the pers
on was shot and the blood was coming out 
the mouth, that Œ the sign was, that™s 
it. And so  did Œ I thought so too, and 

everybody else around that way. 
Q: But you were taken ca
re of by your friend Œ by
 your fellow prisoners? 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
48
A: Yes, but this German, he
 w Œ he was a worker over there, he is the one who 
really helped me, he gave me some food every day. No t mu ch, because he didn™t 

have too mu ch either. 
Q: Was he a guard? 
A: No, he was a working gu
y. He was Œ looks like a penalized worker, because you 
didn™t see no civilians, Germans working in 
that camp. B u t whatever there was, an 
overseer, or Œ or wh at Œ he was not wo rking 
like we did, but in the same area, so I Œ 
I couldn™t tell what he was, but I figure 
he was maybe penalized and put in th ere 
work ing with us, even
 though supervising. What positi
on, I couldn™t tell because he 
wouldn™t tell me nothing, other than he sa
id he is sorry what
 they doing to us. 
Q: Mm-hm, and Œ but he co
vered for you fo r the few da
ys that you couldn™t work ? 
A: He wa Œ yes, he took me down in the 
Œ in Œ in Œ in  the bunker every day an d he 
said, you stay here until I come after you.
 And he used to co
me down and got me 
out just before the work wa
s over. So when there was a 
roll call, I h ad to lift my 
hand up and said aye, you 
know, he count so and so, 
everybody else by name. And 
sometimes they just counted  how many peopl
e, and they  Œ each Œ each group had 
40 - 50 of them, and y
ou better have 50. One was missi
ng, we stayed there til they 
find the body or the person. 

Q: Sure. And how long were you in 
Da cha u
 or 
Misseldorf
(ph), or Œ

A: 
Mildorf
(ph)? I was in 
Mildorf
(ph) til the last day when the Americans were 
already close by and some of the guard  were
 talking to  each other, you know, that 
th-the Americans are already in Œ in Œ close by in 
Mu n i ch
 and all that. So we knew 
that it is co ming, so they wanted to take 
us some death camp , and they told us, get 
ready, we going into  the Œ on that train, you know.  
Q: The Germans? 

A: The Germans told us, yeah. The 
SS. 
Q: When  di Œ wh at time of year was it? 

A: That was in Œ in 
April, 
in ™44. 
Q: No, no, ™45. 
A: I mean ™45. I me Œ  
Q: April ™45, yeah. 

A: Yeah, ™45. And th en he said, everybody 
goes to the train. 
And we walk Œ a-and 
we Œ and we were close, and as we were 
driving, I don™t know how many miles, not 
too many miles, but the American planes
 attacked the train. And they thought 
maybe an army train, whatever it is, and the 
SS
 took off, the guard s, and so did we. 
We opened the train Œ one of them wa
s opened, somebody opened ours because 
every train was opened, and we were scatte
red in the forest, but it didn™t last too 
long because after th
e plane flew out, the 
SS
 guard  came back and picked us up and 

 
Interview with William Klein

50
walked us back. Now, we we
re afraid that they Œ what
 we heard ab out in Œ in Œ 
when we were in Œ still in Œ 
in our home country, that the
 SS
 took civilians in the 
forest and they killed them in
 the forest. And so we figure
d that™s it. But as we were 
walking, it was getting darker and we Œ my 
brother, myself and my brother-in-law, I 
told them we gonna jump 
into the gutter, which was filled up with water, and we 
swam down about maybe two or three kilomete
rs and we got up and we walk ed into 
a farmhouse. And th at™s Œ we stayed til th
e liberation Œ the Americans came in  Œ 
with the farmer™s approval and knowledge
, because he caught us a couple days 
earlier, that we ate the food
 what they were serving to
 the pigs. And th ey were 
making so much noise, they
 knew that something is 
wrong in  their pig house, 
because they never made that  much noise. So 
he caught us, but did not give us up. 
He s Œ he told us what to
 do and where to stay, til the 
SS
 were coming back and 
looking in all the farmhouses. And th
at™s when the American came in. 
Q: And how many people were in  your gr
oup? Just you and your brother and 
brother-in-law? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh, so just the three of you Œ 
A: No, only that Œ in th at one, or Œ th
ere was others, without our knowledge. You 
know, there was Œ well, there was quite a few all around it.

was just you and your brother Œ 
A: And my brother, a-a
nd my  brother-in-law. 
Q: Mm-hm. How were you treated by the Œ the German guards in Œ in Œ when  you 

were in camp in 
Mildorf
(ph)? 
A: Oh no, the
 SS
 Œ the 
SS 
were 
SS
 in every guard . They  did not treat you right. You 
couldn™t ask question, and fo r instance, one time I walked to a 
SS
, a what you call a 
guard house, and wo rking on the Œ on Œ on 
the field, and he was eating pudding. 
And he lo oked at me and he just threw th
e pudding on the grass.
 And he didn™t say 
here take it. He could have Œ you know, 
he could have done 
that, but that would 
have been a Œ a Œ a goodwill gesture. And so
 I walked over ther
e and I put it in my 
shirt, which was nothing but a cement sack
 and I walked  back to my  brother. And 
we ate the pudding from my  sack. And Œ and 
that Œ that was something that he Œ he 
Œ it was out of this world for the simple re
ason, we never had anything in  those Œ in 
that time th at I was in a camp that was sweet
,  and that was sweet. A nd that was just 
a few days before we were liberated.

that the American Œ the Americans, you kno
w, were the soldiers, we didn™t know 
different because we couldn™t understa
nd English. But luckily there was Œ 
Q: Can you describe your first 
encounter with the liberators? 
A: Oh yeah, we went Œ we 
wen Œ we ran to them, we 
hugged them, and Œ and Œ and 
they, you know, tried to, what
 you call, restrain us to 
the point they™re hold it, now 
hold it, everything is all right, you™re safe. But the first thing they ask about who is 
sick, what ch Œ you know, wh
at Œ what™s the problem and 
so on. And we said food, 
food, and food. And that™s what we got Œ 
we got from the Americ
ans, plenty food. 
We had Œ matter of fact, we ate to the tim
e that we fell asleep. We were tired and 
hungry. When we were
 full we just fell asleep over
 there and Œ an d Œ and stayed 
there til the next day, which 
they always ask us what we
 want to do. And I told 
them that I want
 to go back to 
Czechoslovakia
 to look for my family, because I 
knew I had a big family. I knew I couldn™t find
 my father, my mother, my sister, but 
I had younger people. And sure enough, I 
found my  brother, who 
was a staff captain 
in the Czechoslovakian army . Then I heard from him that one of my  brother who 
was a paratrooper in the Czech army wa
s shot in the air 
after liberated my 
hometown. Then  I found out that two of
 my sisters were  alive also i n  my

the first thing we did, we looked  up th
e Jewish community section, because we 
knew that there has to be, because I™m not the only one who su rviv ed, so some are Œ 
they have to get together and find out, 
or get information how to get where. An d 
sure enough, we found out that I had a brother in 
Bratislava

and he said, which one? Cause we had Œ

we all cried, and my  younger brother w

excitement i-i-in my body, I could feel lik

with the speed in me, and then  he was telli
ng me about it that he heard that I Œ our 
two sisters in my hometown and he coul
d not leave his position, even though he 
could have gone easily there. So he told 
me to go and then he said, I heard that

le were in business Œ some people were in business. 
But they  gave you fo od, and you got clothe
s, so mu ch clothes and what Œ what you 
needed. And then there was a place wher
e you went and cleaned your laundry. I 
mean, it was a normal life in the sense that
 you didn™t have to wo rry about anything. 
And the Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. So you we
re there until 1951? 
A: 1950 Œ 1950 Œ 

Q: 1950. 

A: Œ because after th Œ after that, at the e

 because I stayed there 
for awhile and I come

January. 

Q: So you left from 
Bremerhaven
 to 
America
 Œ 
A: Yes.

A: ™51. 

Q: You had applied for a visa, and Œ

Interview with William Klein

64
Q: Oh. 
A: Somebody Œ somebody gave a Œ a story 
that, you know, one of the person that I 

would not let him play with me soccer. He
 got mad and he went to the consul and 
told them that I was a communist. And I 
asked the consul general, when was I a 
communist? And he said I don™t know. I said
, before the war I was 14 years old, and 
after the war I couldn™t be, because I was alw ays Œ almost like in a prison 

[indecipherable].
 So it took a little while and finally he acknowledged that there 
was nothing but a false rumo r and they gave
 me the paper to apply again, you know, 
and Œ and Œ and I was within a few Œ a coupl
e weeks, I was ready to go. And then I 
went to 
Bremerhaven 
and Œ 
Q: Took the boat? 

A: Œ took about 11 Œ 11 da
ys to come to your country, cause I messed Œ missed my  
brother™s wedding. I had a

brothers, the one who sponsored us, 
and that™s where we stayed til everybody go

grandchildren. 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
65
Q: And how do you feel about 
all that experience today? 
A: I feel that it is nothing we could have
 done, but the wo rld as a whole, yes, it 
could have done. And I felt, 
as I™m speaking in an enga
gement, that what happened 
to us, it could happen  to other people, 
because people are fighting not a war, but 
always a religious war. Whatever the reas
on it is, it happens Œ it just so happen ed 
now in 
Russia
 is the same way with the Orthod
ox Ukrainian, with the Muslims 
over there, or 
Yugoslavia
, the Serb , and the Muslim. So it could and it does happen. 
But as far how I feel about it, I think th e 
wo rld could have stopped it and I feel that 
partly President 
Roosevelt
 was also like against the Jewish people, which I feel it 
wa Œ you know, that™s what 
everybody else feel
s the same way about it, because he 
sent the ship back  and the Germans figured
 nobody wanted, so might as well kill us. 
Q: How did you feel during 
the war about being Jewish? 
A: I always felt Jewish, I always was 
proud that I am Jewish, and I™ve been 
approach so  many time by so many people to convert and I told  them that I was 
born a Jew, I am living as a Jew and I will 
die as a Jew. I™m a very proud Jew. I 
would never change with anybody. 
Q: Does the war still affect you now? 
A: I beg your pardon? 
Q: Do th e memo ries of your experiences still affect you? 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
66
A: Ah, yes, it does affect me many ways. Fi
rst is I was beaten up very  badly an d so 
it have the pain, like my knees
, which both has to be repl
aced. My hand was broken 
and my  wrist, and my  back, 
like I said, is like a map. So
 that™s was one thing. The 
second, when I™m in a speaking engagement, 
I feel all if I sleep,
 I dream some times, 
but I try to get away from it because it Œ it 
brings bad memories. So Œ but I have to 
talk about it for the 
simp le reason I get it Œ I get it out of my  system and I feel a 
hundred percent better. That™s what I™m doi
ng that, in the speaking engagement.  
Q: When  did you Œ wh
en were you beaten? 
A: Oh, when  I was in
 the camp, working Œ 
Q: They did beat you up? 
A: Oh yeah, someti me s with a si Œ a Œ 
a Œ a pick, sometime 
with a shovel. And 
many times with a gun butt. 
Q: Where did they b
eat you? Over the Œ 
A: The back . 
Q: On the back. 
A: Uh-huh. And I never said that Œ that I 
had mu scle spasm in my  heart and mu scle 
spasm in my legs. I was married almost 17 
years that when my  wife caught me one 
time in the kitchen on th e floor laying, and 
she turned on the light and I was actually 
pale gray. So she th ought that I have a he
art attack, and I said no, I don™t have a 

 
Interview with William Klein

67
heart attack, I have muscle 
spasm attack in my leg and 
in my  heart. And wh en Œ I 
couldn™t breathe, but the leg paralyzed. Ihad to roll off the be
d and roll into the 
kitchen an d get the, what you call the circ
ulation back in  my  legs. And it™s even 
today, I have it for 50 years. Almost 50 Œ 
Q: Why did Œ why did they
 beat you, fo r what reason did they beat you? 

A: There is no such a thing as a reason fo
r them, for any reason or no reason. They 
just came by and they  hit you. Maybe I was in his way, or he just wanted to let me 
know he is there.  
Q: Did you ever tell your ch ild
ren about your experiences? 
A: Oh yes. When they were in
 Œ in  Œ in Œ around 10 years 
old, I felt that it™s time for 
them to know what I went thro ugh, that 
Œ wh at they knew, I was in a concen tration 
camp, but not the details and as we watc
hed some films, they were talking in 

German, they always asked me to translate 
what they saying, an
d that™s when I was 
telling them ho Œ and what I did and what 
they did to  me. And my  son, who was 
very much active and suppor
tive of the museum, and my 
younger daughter, who is 

sometimes my spokesperson, she can tell you 
my story as good as I am because she 
heard it so many times from me, that if 
Œ one time I mi ssed 
my appointment at 
home with the 
TV
 crew , she was the one who gave my  interview, and th ey 
accepted. That™s Œ that™s Œ 
that™s how well they know. 

 
Interview with William Klein

68
Q: That™s very good. Mr.
 Klein
, did you ever apply or
 receive reparations? 
A: A operation? 
Q: Reparations. 
A: No, I did not apply. I Œ I oh Œ when  I was in 
Germany
 one time, I went to the 
Jewish organization and th ey gave me a 
few hundred dollars. But in this country  
when everybody else si gned up
, I don™t know why, but I just didn™t do it, and Œ but 
a couple years ago, I applied fo r a hardsh
ip  fund and they  gave me 3,000 Œ no, 
5,000 German 
mark
, and Œ wh ich was abou
t 3,000 dollars. That™s the only thing. 
But applied for it now, when th
ey  came out again, the German government said that 
they have 175 million do
llars to give away and so  I a
pplied for it, but so far I didn™t 
hear nothing from them. 
Q: Is there anything else you™d like to Œ to te
ll us, that you have to share with us that 
we didn™t touch on 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, no, I think I just about to ld ev
erything what had happened to  me, wheth-
whether ma jor or minor, but that™s Œ that™s 
just about what it is. I Œ I think I said 
everything there is to be said, as far as th
e story that Œ you know, that it happened to 
me. 
Q: Well thank you very mu ch. 

 
Interview with William Klein   
 
October 18, 1993 
 

 
 
69
A: You™re welcome. And I h
ope people will hear it and read it, but like I said, I Œ 
you know, I have newspaper 
people come out to my  
house. There was a Passover 
they came into
 my house 
[indecipherable] 
paper. If you want me to send you those 
things, you know, I™ll be glad to send it to 
you. Also, I have letters from Œ at least 
500 letters from schools, from children, from 
teachers and all that, that they never 
knew that that™s happen. 
You know, children don™t Œ 
Q: You go and you speak
 in schools, and Œ 
A: And this is Œ the people ask me, do you 
hate? What Œ and I ask one time, what™s 
that? They  said, you know, you hate, you do
n™t like him. Hate does not exist in our 
society as far as the Jewi
sh people is, because we 
[indecipherable]
 from history, 
the only thing we teach is re
member. Because if I hate 
somebody, is only hurts me. 
It doesn™t hurt the other party. He doesn ™t 
know and he doesn™t care. So people were 
so surprised that I don™t hate. No, I have a 
German girl, works in 
a Œ an office that I 
used to be on th e board in there and we
 became very good friends. And she knows 
that, that I don™t hate her. A matter of f
act, her boss is a German Jew, and Œ and he 

accepted her, cause she is a very nice person.
 She was a young girl, she must have 
been about 12 Œ 13 years old.
 She could have been respon
sible, something with her 
father or Œ or grandfather, or uncle, or 
whatever it is. So you 
can™t hate everybody. 
And like I said, there was many good 
Germans too. And Œ and Œ an d Œ

Q: Did you know any? 
A: Yes, I did. And like even Œ like I said, 
after the liberation, and it™s not that they 
would 
[indecipherable] 
they were saying this way, that 
they were told 
if they ever 
help any Jewish person, or any prisoner, th
ey will be killed with their whole family. 
So it was threaten, and let™s face it
, that goes the same way like was in
 Russia
. Your 
family was in jeopard y if you said someth
ing against the government, the same way 
in any other country. So  I would say 
there was many that, like I said, in our 
hometown, when  we wo rked  
with the army, which was 
army, German army, they 
were not hateful, they were not bad. They
 never touched us, never. And they  told us 
that they don™t wa
nt to join the 
SS
 because they  are nothing but mu rderers. 
Q: When  did you find out about your 
parents, your mo ther and father? 
A: The next day, wh en we ask the overseer, the 
ka po s,
 that what they doing with 
our parents, and he said you
r parents are dead. If they we
re old, they are dead the 
same day, some the next day and it got to us 
to the point that we 
were lifeless, like Œ 
like no feeling. You just walking in the air 
and Œ and th ey said y
ou have to get used 
to it and you have to go on
 living. Either you gonna liv
e or you gonna die here, you 
got the choice. And we decided to live. 
Q: In other word s, your parents died shortly after arriving at 
Auschwitz
. 
A: Arrived there, that™s correct.
