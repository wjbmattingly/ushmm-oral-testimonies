Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum
 interview wit h 
Mr. 
Cesare Ugianskis
, on February 18, 2013, in 
Sherman Oa ks
, 
California
. 
Thank you Mr. 
Ugianskis
 for agreeing to speak with us t oda y. And we™re going t o 
start the interview at the very beginning, so I™m going to want t o know about your 
childhood, your background. I™ll start with those basic kinds of questions: when 

were you born, who were your parents, did you have siblings. And we go from 

there. 

Answer: Okay, now you want me to tell that? 

Q: Yes. 
[technical interruption]
 
A: My father was a Lithuanian arm y officer.  

Q: What was his name? 

A: 
Juozapas
, or in English, 
Joseph Ugi anskis
. And he was sent t o 
Italy 
to attend a 
cavalry
 school in 
Pi nerolo
, 
Italy
. Of course my mother was with him because he 
spent several years there. And on November 18, 1929, I was born in 
Italy
. 
Interesting enough, it was on Sunda y, and they couldn™t get ahol d of any medical 

people,so m y dad calledhis 
Œ the doctor, the veterinarian t hat he knew. And I was 
delivered in 
Pinerolo
, 
Italy  
by a veterinari an. Anyway, when he was asked how 
difficult it was, his answer was, it™s a hell of a lot smaller than a horse.

Q: It™s unusual for two reasons: that a Lithuanian is born in 
Italy
, and two, that he™s 
delivered by a veterinarian. 
A: Anywa y, after the school, we returned t o 
L ithuania
 and m y father continued to 

serve in the Lithuanian arm y. 

Q: That™s his cavalry school. Did Œ 
how many years 
Œ do you remember how many 
years it lasted? 

A: Well, I™m not exactl y sure, but I would think probably someti me between ™28 

and ™30. 

Q: Oka y. So, in 1930 you come back to 
Lithuania
, and you probably have no 

memories of 
Italy
. 
A: Very foggy. In fact, when I visited 
Pinerol o 
some years ago, I recognized the 

place where I was being carried around. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes. But that™s all that I remembered about it. 

Q: Oka y. Were you the only child in the famil y? 

A: No, I Œ 
m y 
Œ m y parents had si x children. The oldest one died shortl y after birth, 
then I was t he next, 
Cesare
, born i n 
Italy
. Then m y brother 
Roman
, who was born 
in 
Lithuania
, in 
Kaunas
. And then a sister was born, her name was 
Ligeia
. And 
unfortunately she died from one of the diseases that was spreading around, ma ybe

t yphus or somethi ng li ke that. Or diphtheria. Anyway, she died at the age of five. 
Andthen m y brot her 
Joseph
, 
Joe
 was born in 
Lithuania
. So he was 10 years 
younger than I. And then a year later or so my sister was born, 
Grazina
. She, and 
we all ended up in t he 
United States
, as a family. 
Q: Di Œ were you growing up, after you returned from 
Italy
 in 
Kaunas
, in the 
capital city at the ti me? 

A: No. At first we lived in 
Alytus
, 
Lithuania
, where m y father was a cavalry 
officer. Only in 1939, we moved to 
Kaunas
. 

Q: Oh, so your early experiences are from 
Alytus
. 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s ri ght. 
Q: And your father, I t hen take it, was a professional mi litary man. 
A: That™s ri ght, he was a professional military man. Just one Œ one thi ng about this 

mil itary career. He started out during World War II in the tsar™s arm y. 

Q: Oh, let™s Œ 
let™s start 
Œ let™s go back a bi t. Tell me about your father. 
A: Oka y. 

Q: What ki nd of a person wa Œ where Œ when was he born, the dat e of his birth and 

his name, his kind of background and how he became a mi litary man.

A: Oka y, well, I think he was born in 19 Œ I™m sorry 1893. And there™s a confusion 
about the date because it was at that time there was the old calendar, t hat was 

changed later. So I t hink his birthda y is on the 18
th
 of January in 19 Œ I mean, 1893. 
Q: And he grew up in 
Lithuania
? 
A: In 
Kaunas
, he grew up in 
Kauna s
, and after they Œ 
Li
thuania
 fought for its 
independence in 19 Œ 1819, he was a volunteer in that arm y. 

Q: Oh, I™d like to step Œ still step back a bit. If he was born in 1893, t hen he would 

have been of draft age at what point, 17 - 18 years old in the middle of World War 

I?  

A: Yes. 

Q: So, you mentioned he was in the tsar™s arm y, was he drafted into that arm y? Or 

did he Œ 
A: Oh yes, he was, yes he was, yes. 
Q: Oka y. Did he used t o tell you stories of his experiences? 

A: No, no.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: He never talked about his years that he served in the Œ in the fight for the 
Lithuanian independence. The Œ the only thing that I remember about it, that 
he was

given a Œ 
a 
medal which is called 
Wikyas
(ph) 
kryžius
. But essentially it ™s the same 
kind of thing that we have Medal of Honor. 
Q: And what was t hat for? 

A: It was for his bravery fighting in the Œ in the Œ with the Polish and Russian 

troops. 
Q: Oka y. So, from the tsar™s arm y, after World War I ends, that™s when 
Lithuania
 
starts fighting for independence? 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: And he chan
ges armies?
 

A: That™s ri ght, he changes armies. 

Q: Oka y, and he Œ okay. 

A: He becomes an officer in the Li thuanian arm y, in the cavalry. 
Q: I see. 
A: That™s how he ended up in 
Italy
. 
Q: So, did he have the t itle of 
savanoris karys
, if he was fighting for Lithuanian 

independence? 

A: I don™t remember the title, but ti Œ the t itle t hat I think of is Œ was 
savanoris 
Œ  
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ volunteer, essentiall y.

Q: A volunteer, okay. 
A: And then he Œ when the war was Œ 
I mean, 
Lithuania
 gained its independence, 

he ended up going to military school, and became an officer in the Lithuanian arm y. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And after that, he continued to serve. 
Q: And your mother? Tell us a littl e bit about her. Where was she born, what was 
her name? 

A: Oka y, my mot her was born in a small village along the 
Nemunas
 river, 

Ploksciai
. Her father was a very successful lawyer in 
Lithua ni a
 and he had a large 
estate in that little town. And when I was on my wa y, the y were in 
Ploksciai
, in that 
little town and was deli vered there, and th-
t h ey 
Œ  they Œ I mean, she was born there. 
And I-I thi nk she was born in 
1906
, but I don™t remember the date. 
Q: Oka y, oka y. 
A: And Œ 

Q: Do you remember t he estate? Do you remember the est ate? 

A: Oh, the estate, yes, I do remember the estat e, because I was there, trying to get 

her back under the new 
Lithuania
. 

Q: Oh, I see. But when you were growing up, did you spend time on t his estate?

A: I probably Œ I remember being there once or twice, wi th my mother, visiting 
there. 

Q: I see. So, let™s t urn a little bit, and talk about your parents as Œ as people. What 

kind of personalities di d the y have? 

A: Well, let  me just  finish about my mot her. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Her name was 
K rasauskita
(ph), which is derived from 
Krasauskas
(ph). And 
she was fairly young when she got married to m y father in 1926, I think. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And essentially m y Œ m y dad was a mi litary fa Œ 
m y 
Œ m y family was a milit ary 
family, so we moved around. And I remember living in t he place called 

Myampoli
(ph). That™s where Œ the first place I remember I lived. Then I lived in 
Alytus
, and then we moved to 
Kauna s
. And when in 1940, when the Russians 
essentially occupied 
Li thuania
 and 
Lithua nia
 became the Socialist Republic, m y 
father was dra Œ transferred into the Red Arm y. So he became a lieutenant colonel 

in the Re
d Arm y.
 

Q: Well, here™s Œ I have a question about t hat, and I™ll ask it now, and then we™ll go 

back a little bit to your Œ  

A: Oka y.

Q: Œ to your childhood. Things like that happened, but it sounds to me rather 
unusual, because many army officers, many pro
fessional military men
 were actually 
arrested by t he Soviets. So how i s it that he wasn™t Œ not only not it Œ wasn™t he 

arrested, but  he becom es a military officer in the Soviet arm y?  

A: Well, because he never was involved in pol itics. 
Q: I see. 
A: And his father was a policeman that was killed by the Germans during World 

War I. And so essential ly, he came from a si mple family, and he was born in a li ttle 

town on Œ on Œ along t he 
Nemunas 
river. And he spoke very good Russian, because 

he lived in 
Russi a 
for years too, being Œ being Œ being i n the service. So essent ially, 
he wasn™t arrested, but we found out that when Œ when the German occupied 

Lithuania
 in 1941, we found out that we are i n a Œ the family was on a list to be 
deported to 
Siberia
 next week. 
Q: R
eally?
 
A: Yes.  
Q: So it di dn™t matter t hat he woul d have been a Soviet arm y officer? 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s ri ght. That™s what I heard.

Q: Oka y. 
A:I mean,Ididn™t see any paper
 or anything, because at that time I was too young 

to decipher a nything, I was essenti ally Œ in 1941 I was 11 years old. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Or in 1940. 
Q: So when Œ when you were growing up, and you moved around in different 
places, was there somet hing that was different between Œ you felt was different 

between your family and other ki ds? 

A: Yes, because we al ways have to make new friends. So it™s j ust kind of different, 

but we Œ 
we 
adapted to that very quickly. It di dn™t really bother us. Because 

essentially we moved 
Œ  we really moved with the arm y, you know, it wasn™t 
like a
 
new job or something. It was just o-officer being moved t o a Œ getting another 
assignment. 
Q: In a different place. 

A: Yeah, in a different place, so we just Œ  

Q: Were all of your friends Lithuanian when you were growing up?  

A: Yes, I would sa y so. Yeah, 
come 
Œ well, not really. There were several ethnic 

Russians t hat lived in 
Lithuania
 that I befriended, yes.

friends who were Germans, did you Œ

m y grandmother™sneighbors were 
Lithuanian Jews.
 And Œ 

Q: And your grandmother lived where? 
A: I beg your pardon? 
Q: Where di d your grandmother l ive? 

A: Oh, she lived i n 
Kauna s
.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: And she was friends with them, and the y had some chil dren there and so I would 

Œ when I would vi sit my grandmother, I would play with them. And then, of course, 

the y disappeared in 1941. 
Q: Do you remember t heir names? 
A:

Q: Oka y. Did you remember your parents t alking about Œ you sa y your father 
wasn™t very political, but do you remember your parents talking about history or 
politics, or what was going on in the world? 

A: Well, some of it, but not Œ not anything that I remember 
as a 
Œ 
as an
 outstanding 

thing. My father was prett y adept at  getting along with the government. 

Q: Yeah?  

A: So Œ 

Q: What does that mean?

A: Well,he didn™t participatein 
Œ i n Œ in any cliques, and was Œ was a fair guy, and 
Œ and his underlings al ways loved hi m because he was very fair, he was tolerant 
person. 

Q: What ki nd of a person was he personali ty- wise?  
A: Well, he was pretty straightforward, but  pretty strict, as an officer. 
Q: Was he? Yeah? 
A: And when he said something t o do, you di d it. 

Q: Wasthere military precisionin thehouse?
 
A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: No, m y mother was the family™s boss i n the house. 

Q: Oh really? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. And was she strict too? 

A: No, she was actually very easygoing. Occasionally, you know, she kind of 

pretended she was beating us, you know, and she just ki nd of went past the face, 

you know, past the rear end, you know, 
and
 that was about it. No, she was very 

gentle. 

Q: Oh. Did Œ was your family religious?

A: Not that much. My mother was more t han my father. But I don™t remember 
going to church very often with them.  

Q: Mm-
hm. What was thereligion?
 
A: Catholi cs. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: 
My 
Œ sa y one Œ one thing about m y mother. Many years later, when I Œ 
when we 
were here in the 
Uni ted States
, my mot her, and in fact her sister too, told me that in 

m y mother™s family, in Œ there was a Jew t hat married a Li thuanian women. And in 

fact, that was a big 
[indecipherable]
 secret on the German occupation. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you know who t he Œ who t he family member was that that person married? 
A: No, it had to be three or four generations back. 
Q: I see. So the family itself, 
Krasauskas
(ph) f
amily was concerned t hat the y may 
be targeted Œ  

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Œ because there had been a Jewi sh relati ve. 

A: That™s ri ght, because there was a Jewish relative, and so nobody talked about it, 

and people that knew didn™t bring it up 
anywhere.

Q: I see. Even though i t could have been in the ni Œ in the 19
th
 century. 
A: That™s ri ght. So anyway Œ  
Q: Oka y. Do you recall  any kinds of Œ any kind of talk about Jews being different 

than other people, when you were growing up? 

A: Oh yes, you know, all Lithuanians considered Jews different people. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y still do. 

Q: Oka y, what do you remember from your childhood? What kind of Œ what kind of 

views were there? 

A: Well, as I say, m y father was not very Œ he™s a very tolerant, you know, he Œ 

Q: I™m not talking about your parents, and your family, but growi ng up in an 

atmosphere, you know. 
A: Oh Œ oh Œ oh, well it™s essentially re-
real ly anti
-Semitic judgment. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: That Jews, you know, take ad Œ take advantage of s Œ of Œ of Lithuanians. That 

was sort of an idea that was spread. I think in fact th-they Œ the Lit huanians were 

very tolerant, because in 1300s, Jews came to 
Lithuania 
because they were being 
evicted from 
Engl and
 and 
Germany
 and 
Austria
. And they came to 
Poland
, 
Lithuania
, because at that time Lit huanians themselves 
were 
Œ weren™t Christians. 

 
Interview with Cesare Ugianskis

Very tolerant, the y were pagans, you know. And so th Œ 
Lithuania
 li ved with those 
Jews until u Œ udi Œ uni fication with 
Poland
, i n Œ I think in 1500s. And that™s when 
Jesuits come in, and they t he ones that spread all those bad stories about the Jews. 

Q: And what were some of those bad stori es? 

A: Oh, about Jews taking the kids, rolling them in a barrel  full of nails and using 
their b Œ the y blood to Œ 
to make matzo. 
 
Q: Those were the sort s of things that you™d hear growing up? 

A: That™s ri ght, that™s right. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And that they were stealing thi ngs from people, you know, the y were really bad 

people. Of course, all it was, jealousy, because Jews were organized well, the y were 

well educated. And there were Œ of course there were poor Jews too, but Œ but Œ but 
lot of them were Œ were well educat ed people. In fact, you know, there were 
restrictions, you know, in the professions, like 
[indecipherable]
 get in. For 
example, the y couldn™t own land. 

Q: Really
? 
 
A: The y weren™t all owed to own land. 

Q: In independent 
Lithuania
? 
A: At first, yes.

Q: At first. 
A: And then later, yes. 

Q: And later the y were allowed. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah, mm-
hm.
 
A: But at first, no. And in general, i t was i dea that the Jews in general  were taking 

advantage of people, so you had to be careful of them. That was sort of negative I 

remember. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you Œ 

A: On the other hand, on the other hand, there were good Jews that were friends of 

m y parents, you know. 

Q: So that your parents socialized with different Œ different groups of people, not  
just Œ 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Oh yeah. 
Oh yeah, when 
Œ when he was growing up, there was Jewish peopl e 
who were living there next door to them. So Œ

Q: Did your parent s tal k about their friends who were different nationalities much, 
or is it just you knew them, this was Œ thi s was this person, this was that person, and 

so on?  

A: I™m not sure how to answer that, but m y parents essenti ally weren™t very anti-

Semitic in many wa ys, I would sa y. The y were very tolerant and the y would just  
shrug it off. 
Q: I see. 

A: And I don™t remember really my mother or father badmouthing Jews. 

Q: Did Œ do you have memories of going to school before the war? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: Do you have memories of going to school before the war?  

A: I did?  
Q: Yes. 
A: Oh yes, I remember starting grammar school in 1936. I was, I guess six years old 

or seven years old Œ six Œ 
six yearsold, yeah. 
 
Q: Uh-huh.

A: Yes. Well, there™s another person that lives here in

 that I went to

Q: And the y™re here too? 

A: And he lives here too. And there™s anot her friend of mine that I went to Œ 
I mean, 

I start to go to high school in 1941, probably, we started together. And in fact, when 

w Œ when Œ when Œ when we lived in

Germany
 in the 1930s, or what was going on in the 
Soviet Union

A: You know, I just remember badmouthi ng 
Soviet Union

A: Wejust moved to 
K aunas 
from

Q: I see. 

A: And I remember people walking around you know, some for it, some against it, 

you know. And there were a lot of communists out on the streets, celebrating the 

liberation from the

th

became 
Œ 
the Lithuanian army became 26
th

 after the Soviet

shipping home. And so there was talk about the fact that there ma y be food 

shortages, you know, and that Œ and now we won™t have any bananas, you know, 

and all that. I kind of remember tho Œ that t alk. So it was repe Œ pretty much 
recognizing that 
Russia
 was not a Œ 
a

Q: Oka y, so it was a surprise. 

A: Oh, it was a big surprise.

his views of Œ of being transferred into it, or anyt hing li ke that?

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he just Œ he j ust wo Œ he was a survivor, pol itical survivor. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: By not getting involved. 

Q: Oka y. And so when the y retreated, he did not? 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: And what happened after that? 
A: Well, interesting. He got a job in
 Vilnius
 as a commander of the famous prison 
in Œ in Œ in lithu Œ in

Q: This is a continuation of our interview on February 18
th
, 2013, with Mr. 
Cesare 
Ugianski s
. And when we broke off before, we were talking about 1941 Œ 
1942 in 

Kaunas
, you had heard of Œ you had s Œ heard of neighbors of your grandmother™s 

who were Jews, who were brought to 
Vilijampole Slobodka
, to what became the 

ghetto. You found out soon thereafter that Jews were bei ng taken an -and shot at  

various places around the city. Can you tell us a little bit about the geography of 

Kaunas
, and what were the old forts that were there, that ended up being executi on 
places?  
A: Well, I™ll tell you what I know, or at least I think I know.
 
Kauna s
 was a city i n 
Lithuania
 that was populated by Lithuani ans, and about 30 percent, I believe, at 

one time, was Jewi sh. 

Q: Oka y. 

A:And m y parents 
Œ 
my 
Œ  
m y p  
Œ m y father™s parents lived in 
Kaunas
,  m y 
grandfather Œ 
m y 
Œ m y grandfather was a police officer. And in 1918 or so, when he

was arrested by the Germans, he was killed in a 
POW
 camp. So I never met hi m or 
her Œ or Œ or saw hi m. And after that, what  can I sa y? We moved to 
Kaunas
, 
because my father was transferred from 
Alytus
 to 
Kaunas
 in 1939. And soon after 

we arrived i n 1940, Russians came in. 

Q: Well, what I™d like to do if you Œ if you have memories of this, or knowledge of 
this,
 Kaunas
, from what I Œ or 
Kovno
, as it is known in Yiddish, is ri nged, or th Œ 
around the city is ri nged by a series of forts. That™s not usual for most  European 

cities. 

A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Can you tell us about which Œ what was the historical basis of these forts? 

A: Well, it was done by 
Catheri ne the Great
. 
Q: Oka y, so tell us about these forts. 
A: Well, all  I know about it is the fact that there are about, I think, 12 of them 
surrounding 
Kaunas
. That™sessentially when 
Œ when Œ when I was alive, some of 
them had certain Œ cert ain uses. Li ke the fort where we lived, fort five was storage. 

There are a lot of Œ mil itary storage, workers Œ 

Q: What di d Œ what did a fort look like? I mean, sometimes people wi ll imagine 
a 

fort as being an entire complex where people even live in it. What were these forts? 

Were the y li ke towers, or were the y like Œ

A: No, the y Œ th
e y™re 
Œ interesting enough, they were level ground. 
Q: The y were on level ground. 

A: Level ground, and t hey had wat er surrounding them, 
th
-the y had a Œ whatever 
you call
 that. 
Q: A moat? A moat? 
A: Yes, a moat surrounding it. And inside they had the quarters and they had 
weapons, artillery and so on. But I don™t think that very many people lived there. 

There lived, surrounding the fort, the y had Œ they had buil dings, and the fort that I 

remember was fort number four, fort number five, fort number nine. Thes
e are the 

three forts that I remember because t he y™re connected wit h Œ with the history in 

some wa ys, for me. 

Q: Oka y, i s it possible t o give Œ 
[i nterruptio n]
 
A: So, the other forts, I don™t know what they were used for, but number Œ and Œ 

and that™s ri ght, and there was number six, I t hink, that was used as a prison. 

Number ni ne Œ 

Q: You tol d me before the ole Œ before the war. 

A: Before the war, yeah.

Q: So 
Catherine the G reat
 had bui lt them. 
A: The y built them, they were just Œ sat there, because nobody attacked 
Ka unas
, 
nobody needed them. And so 
it was 
really probably a great waste of Œ of Œ of tsar™s 
money to build them, but the y build them, and as I say, when I was li ving in 
Lithuania
 they were used as prisons and storage u Œ places. And Œ  
Q: About how big would these forts be? 
A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: About how big would these complexes be, these fort complexes? 

A: O-Okay, let me see, how ca Œ how to describe it? Well, it™s probabl y Œ diameter

A: The y had brick, brick and cement
, yeah. And 
Œ 
and ce 
Œ and iron. Iron was Œ was 
one of the things t hat t hey were using there. The gates, and Œ e-entrance to the fort, 
at Œ at Œ at 
l east
 the number four and five had this huge steel wall, steel fence that 
they opened ev Œ to get  in and ge Œ get out. 
Q: Could you see through that steel fence, or was it Œ 

A: Oh yeah, no, you could see right through it
, youcould seethe bild 
Œ the building. 

In fact, there were som e quarters there and storage places, right Œ right after the 

entrance, so the y could come in wi th the vehicles, unload them, you know, and so 

on. But then, the rest of it was all i n and out, you know, i t was just Œ just a lot of ins 
Œ for Œ for mounting weapons, for looking through, you know. And even when I 
think about it now, I™m not sure what Œ what 
they would havedone withthem
, even 
if they were attacked.  

Q: Oka y. Well, bei ng built by 
Catherine the Great

A: That™s ri ght. That™s right, exactly. So anyway, so that™s what I remember about  
those forts. And the one that I™m most 
acquainted
 is number five, because we lived 
about 200 feet from Œ 200 meters from Œ from the fort. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: My father had a house built there on a five hectare land, it™s like 15 acres. And 
so we used to go and play t here. 
Q: At the fort? 

A: At the fort. 

Q: Oka y, were you allowed inside? 

A: Oh, we Œ 
kids, you know
, could get in anywhere. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So Œ so we™d go in there and at one time when Œ when Œ in 1941, when Germans 
attacked 
Russia
, we went in there and there was th Œ there was a food storage there. 
And I remember loading ourselves up with cans of Œ of vegetables and goods, 
you 
know, food, because there was Œ full of it there. And people Œ 
whole neighborhood, 

you know, was coming in and goi ng out with Œ with goodies.

Q: Yeah. Were these forts alwa ys under some sort of government al or municipal 

control?  

A: Oh yes, all the ti me, yes. 
Q: Oka y, so the y™ve never been pri vatized? 
A: No, the y just Œ I™m not sure if the other forts were wide open like the fifth one 

was. Fourth one, of course, was al wa ys kind of closed up because t he y always had 

the Œ I think somet hing going on, you know, with Œ wit h prisons or something like 

that. But Œ  

Q: How could the y be used as prisons? Did they have Œ

And fort number ni ne and I think six, were prisons. And Œ and t hen in the end 

actually, number five, t his is where the most of the Jews were killed. 

Q: In fort number five?  
A: Nine. 
Q: In fort number nine.

A: Oka y, well, at one Œ this is during the summer now, so we™re l oose, on summer 
vacation. And so for nothing better to do, we used to come and vi sit my father in the 

Œ in the sawmill, and go in swi mming in the river. And so along t he ri ver one ti me, I 

Œ coming i n from Œ toward us, al ong the river 
Nemunas
, we saw thi s Œ this huge 
crowd moving. And we said, well, let™s take a l ook what it  is. So wen Œ we went up 
there, and what it was, it was actual ly most people were ha Œ we-wearing the yel low
 
David
 star, meani ng that they were Jews. And they were young people and young Œ 

and Œ and small chi ldren, and ladies and Œ and men, older men mostly. And the y 

were marching towards 
[indecipherable]
 towards number four fort. So we decided 
to follow them, and so we saw them move this huge crowd into the fort. And then 

we kind of cut behi nd there and we stood on t he outside edge of the moat, and we 

could see inside. And we saw thi s Œ these people in a single row, moving in, and 
throwing in their belongings in a pile. 
Q: So, in other words, outside of the fort, there was an elevation t hat was even 

higher than the Œ than the walls of the fort itself? 

A: That™s ri ght, a little bit higher, yes. 

Q: And you could stand on that and Œ and look in? 

A: Outside?  

Q: Yeah.

A: No, no, that was lower, that Œ the Œ the Œ where we were standing was lower. 
There were higher places in the fort itself. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But we were looking down in the fort from the moat.  

Q: I see, okay. 
A: And so we were looking down in the fort, and we coul d see thi s si ngle row of 
people going and throwing in whatever t he y were carrying with them, you know. 

And Œ 

Q: Werethe y undressi ng?
 

A: Well, I don™t real ly t hink they were undressing there, I think they undressed 

later. But Œ  but they were throwing in their goods there. And then they marched in 

there and after awhile, we started hearing gunfire, you know, and we realized what  
was going on, they were shooting them. And all of a sudden we saw t his guard tar Œ 
running toward us, you know, coming toward us. So we realized t hat they don™t 

want us here. So we started running and they kept on yelli ng stop, and we just took 

off. And of course, you know, bei ng younger and faster, just took off and knew Œ 
we knew where we were going, the y didn™t. And so we escaped. But Œ but that™s 

when we realized that that™s what it was, you know, this is Œ probabl y Œ  I guess this 

i Œ this was probably early August of 1941.

Q: Oka y. 
A: And then, you know, we sort of heard that t here were some more shootings t here 

after that, but not very much. But there were continuous shooti ng apparently going 

on in fort number nine. I mean, we heard about it. We couldn™t hear, but we heard 

about it. Well anywa y, what happened then was that, let™s see, about 1944, about 
February, the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian 
war pr 
Œ prisoners of war, and 
they were st arting to di g up Œ that™s what we heard from ot her people, I didn™t see it 
Œ that they were digging up the bodies, putting them in piles and setti ng them on 

fire. Well, what I remember about that was that when the wind was downwin Œ we 

were Œ lived downwind, we got thi s horri ble smell of human bodies burned Œ 

burning. 

Q: So Œ so was it the si Œ entire city was covered with this wind?  
A: No, no, no, just Œ just toward our for Œ toward Œ toward us 
[in
deci pherable]
 the 
fifth fort. 
Q: And di d you Œ and you knew that that™s what it was? 
A: Oh sure. We heard about it from people. Here is Œ here™s where Œ where we 

were, oka y?

Q: Is someplace right Œ right here, you sai d? 
A: Right t

Q: Oka y. Right there would be where fort number nine was, and as the bodies were 

being burned, the y were Œ 

A: No, not in nine, in fort number for Œ for Œ four being burned. 

Q: Oh, I see, they were burned in fort number four as well. 

A: Oh, that™s what I mean, that™s what we witnessed.

A: Yes, right. 

Q: Œ there were bodi es being burned everywhere. 

A: Well, that™s right, but Œ but Œ but they were burning t hem in a Œ number four fort 
and we were getting the wind. 
Q: I got it. 

A: Because we Œ the y were here and we lived here. 

Q: Got it. 

A: And so the Œ the wi nd would come right down toward us, you know, and I never 

forget that smell. It™s just incredibl e. So that™s m y experience with Œ with watchi ng 

people led t o execution. I Œ I Œ we didn™t see the actual shooting because it was 
inside the fort. 
Q: What di d you see through, did you see through the gatewa y? Or through 

windows?  

A: No, no, we were standing on t he Œ on the outside on t he moat and looking in. 

Q: So, but in through what? Was it an open area?

Q: Did you hear anybody scream?  
A: No, no, no, we were too far from that.

just marching in there. 

Q: And you saw children as well? 
A: Oh yeah, there were children and then women, and then Œ then

Q: Oka y, but was t he uniform a German issued uniform? 

A: Oh, I™m sure it was German Œ 
German created
. 
Q: I see. 

A: Or German by Œ created by German orders, because during the fort Œ between

Latvians and Œ and Œ and Œ and Estonians. And the y had 
SS

Q: I guess what I™m trying to find out is whether or not, as members of the self-

Lithuania
. 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: Oka y, oka y. 

A: No, no, they were wearing something modi fied.

Q: Oka y. 

A: No, I don™t think so.

A: I don™t think so. I think we sta yed awa y from all those. See, we lived on the 
outskirts, number four Œ five fort is on the out skirt of 
K
a una s
 and it was pretty 
empty there. You know, there was a couple of Œ like I want to sa y five homes 

probably, around where I lived, you know, and so nobody went by there. 

Q: How did life progress for your family duri ng these occupation years, between 

™41 and ™44?  

A: Well, actually wasn™t as bad as it could have, because my father had a good job, 
and he provided money to buy food for us on the black market. So we Œ we wou Œ 
m y mother would goto 
Sha unsha i
(ph), to the black market  there and buy food for 
the mone y my father had. 

Q: Well, you had a prett y big fami ly.

A: Oka y, well, all of a sudden, you know, we Œ front kept on advancing, you know. 
On the radio we could hear that the Œ that t he Russians were now at t he 
Ukraine
 

and Russians were now in 
Belarus
,
 
you know. And then we could Œ started to hear 
the echoes of the Œ of the weapons, you know, the cannons. We could hear cannons 

firing and exploding. And so, my father realized that there™s no wa y for us to stay 
because essentially he™s a deserter from the R ed Arm y. So what can we do? So m y 
father fou-found some friends in the self-defense force, who issued him some sort 

of a paper that Œ that  would allow us to go through the border into 
G ermany
. 
Q: So, was this the same self-defense force that had been taking Œ was this the same 

self -defense force Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ that would have taken part in t hese execut ions? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, the same Œ same people. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: So anyway, so the y took us to 
Dresden
, 
G ermany
. But m y father was supposed 
to go back, and become a commander in the f Œ some town or something. But, on 

the wa y there, Russians occupied 
L ithuania
, so he came back, and we ended up 
working in a factory
, 
Seidel Naumann
 
factory that you 
Œ before the war used to 
make sewing machines, right now was making pieces for Œ for mil itary purposes. In

a machine, that were parts being made together for Œ for the submari nes. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, that™s Œ and so anywa y Œ and then we got bombed out. 

Q: While youwere in 
Dresden

Dippol diswalde

A: The Œ the guy responsible for Œ for the upkeep of the yard. 
Q: Upkeep of what kind of a yard?

yeah,
 right. You see, t he y Œ they were making also some sort of 
mil itary parts. And I got a job there as a Œ as a apprentice in Œ in their apprentice 

school, metalworki ng apprentice school. And so we were working there until we Œ 
again we heard the guns firing around, you know, and we started going toward 
Germany
, trying t o go south, you know, to Œ t o get to Œ t o the western forces, 
because my father didn™t want to get overrun by t he Russians, you know. 

Q: Oka y. I want to stop just a little bit.

A: Oh yeah, I saw Œ 
Q: Tell us what you saw. 

A: I came back to 
Dresden
 about Œ I would say about two weeks after the Œ the 
huge bombings. And in fact, my brother and I. And we walked down t o the center 

of the town. And there was this pi le, you know, covered up with burlaps, you know, 
and Œ 
and wethought, what
 the hel l is this? So we went to take a look. It was a pile 
probably six meters high, so Œ so like 18 feet or so, of bodies. Dead bodies. Burned 

bodies, but dead bodies, just a pile. 

Q: And nothing was being done, t he y were bei ng burned, or Œ 

A: Well, they were just  sitting there, the y were Œ obviously the y got collected, but 

no Œ but you know, they were probably digging out other people t oo, you know. But 

that™s what we saw. And we walked around, and we just couldn™t believe you know, 
all those beautiful buil dings, they™re all gone, you know, in the center of Œ of 
Dresden
. And so we of course came back Œ came back to 
Dippoldiswalde 
the same 
d ay.
 
Q: But I Œ again I want to sta y wit h this a bit. You were still on t he outskirts of 

Dresden
 as it was being bombed?  
A: Yes. 

Q: What 
Œ were you in a house, were you in a cellar?

A: No, I Œ no, no, I was in a plant. 
Q: And it was being bombed, that plant. 

A: Yes, yes. And t he building above us collapsed, but lucky for us, it didn™t break 

through down to t he basement. So we were able to walk out after the building 

collapsed, but didn™t collapse into the basement. And so we came out of the 
basement when the fire was burning around. 
Q: And was it only the workers of the factory who were t here, or whole families? 

A: 
Well mo
st Œ 
m y 
Œ 
my 
Œ  
m y 
mother was there, she was injured. As a matter of 
fact, m y mother was somewhere else because we were at work, so we were 

somewhere else. And so we came home 
in th
e day, we couldn™t find our mother. So, 

few days lat er we started looking for her. And so we walked in on one of the nearer 

hospitals and sure enough we found her in hall way. She already had gangrene set in 
on her leg, but luckily not far enough, and we got the doctors to take care of her so 
Œ so sh Œ t he y didn™t have to amputate her leg or anything, so she survived the 

bombing. She™s the only one in our family that  was hurt during the World War II. 

Q: And it was at t he bombing of dre Œ 
Dresden
? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y.

Q: And your brothers and sisters also?  
A: Oh yeah, they were with mother, yeah. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because you know, I was Œ i-in 
Dresden
 
I was14 yearsold. So my younger 

brother was four years old, my younger sister was three years old. So they were 
with the mother, but somehow the y got back to the camp, you know, where we were 
Œ th-the barracks, where we were st ationed.  
[brea k]
 
A: Œ mother was gone and we couldn™t quite get out of these kids what happened to 

mom.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: The y took her awa y, you know. That™s about all they could tel l us.  
Q: Oka y. So you must have been frightened until you found her. 
A: Oh, it was. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was. So finally we found Œ found her and Œ and lucky for us, you know, she Œ 

she survived, and Œ and so that™s t he part t hat I remember vividly. And then, o

But a couple of times we actually had the planes, American planes flying over in the 
dayt ime and strafing them, you know, from the air fr Œ shooting at Œ on the ground. 

Q: Right. 

A: In fact, one ti me I Œ I Œ I was on the road when the y were running out shooti ng, 

and I thought they probably shooti ng at me, but the y didn™t. Probably saw it 
was a 
kid, you know, so the guy didn™t shoot me. 
Q: Yeah. And so Œ 

A: And then m y father, he was ahead of me f Œ because somehow we separated, he 

was ahead of me, and he went into the doorway. And when the y were firing, you 

could see the bullet hits right around there where he stood, but Œ but it  wouldn™t hit 

hi m because he was in a doorway, so he didn™t  get hit. We were a lucky family. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So anyway, so then we started hearing the shooting outside the 
Di ppoldiswalde
, 
and we deci ded to get out. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because we Œ again, we didn™t want to fall i n the Russians. So we walked into

Czechoslovakia
, all the wa y t o the American zone. And when we got to 

American zone, the American sol diers stopped the traffic. They wouldn™t let people 

go across t he bridge. And my father said, t his i s something screwy. He walked off 
the road, talked to a farmer, and asked hi m was there anot her wa y t o get to Œ get  out 
of here. He said yes, take this d-di rt road here, walk up, you know, two kilometers, 

turn left and you™ll wal k into the road that goes right into 
Germany
. So my father 
says, we™re not going t o wait and l isten to these Americans. So we walked, we get 

to the border and we see a soldier guard, American guard walking around. My 

father looked around, he says, let™s go, he won™t bother us, he™s talking to a girl. 

Sure enough, we walked, he just kind of Œ I don™t know if he even saw us, probably 
he didn™t. And we j ust walked in and sure enough, that night Americans withdrew 
from 
Czechoslovakia
 and Russians took over. 

Q: Oh 
m y goodness.
 
A: So I keep on sa yi ng, you know, we were the luckiest family in World War II, to 

survive things like that. So anyw

Lithuani a

A: Well, they part Œ essentially part icipated in a part of Holocaust. 
Q: Oka y, tell us about t hat. 
A: Oka y, my father-in- law 
Darsha
(ph) 
Starkus
 told me the story. 

Q: O
k a y.
 
A: He and a guy by the name of 
Belkinus
(ph) went to medical school  together. And 

the 
Belkinus
(ph) was a Jew. And so then, by coincidence, they Œ 
he 
Œ Dr. 
Starkus
 
ended up as a district doctor of this small district in Œ in 
Lithuania
, around 
Diletus
(ph). 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And it t urned out 
to be
 
Belkin
(ph) ended up there too. And the y used to get 

together occasionally. Wel l, one da y, when they started pe Œ pushing people into the 

ghettos, my father-
in
-law, Dr.
 
Sta rkus
 was going to work, and he saw Dr.
 
Belkin
(ph) with his wife and a daughter, wi th suitcases going towards the railroad 

station. He said, where you going? Well, 
Vilijampole
. He said, you know what™s 

 
Interview with Cesare Ugianskis  
 
February 1

going on t here, don™t go. He sa ys, where can I go? Come with me. He took the 
family to his sister-in-law house and put t hem up there. In the meanti me, as a doctor 

of that district, he became friends with a German Œ with a German commander of 

the town, or of the district. And he used to come occasionally to visi t and for dinner. 

Well, one day he came in, you know, and he says, I™ve got to leave earl y toda y 
because we have to go to south side of 
Aytus
 to arrest Jews that are people housi ng. 
Q: No kidding. 

A: So the German one way, the father-in-law the other, ran over to that sister-in-

law™s house, put the people in a car and drove them to another place, and then the 

following da y he found a place to put them with a f Œ some of his acquaintance that 

had a farm next to th Œ to Œ to the woods Œ to t he fl Œ 
you know. And apparently 
the y built a double wall  somewhere where t hey could hide if somebody came. And 
Dr. 
Belki n
(ph) and his wife stayed there, but the d-daught er, they couldn™t keep her 
there. So Dr. 
Sta rkus 
arranged wit h a priest to give hi m a birth certificate of Œ of a 

dead
 girl as hers. And he put up with Œ with Œ with an older lady, a friend of his, or 
a 
Œ someone he knew. And that™s how they survived the war.  

Q: So the whole 
Belkin
(ph) family Œ  
A: The whole 
Bel kin
(ph) family survived. And the little girl was Œ was Œ was 

christened to be a C hristian Œ Catholic, by the lady. Anywa y, they had a little hard

time Œ well, of course, and then the Russi ans came. And of course Dr. 
Belkin
(ph) 
and his wife survived and their little daughter survived. And the l ittle Œ they had the 
little trouble getting the girl back because the woman didn™t want to give her up, 

after three years or so. 

Q: You get  attached. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Anywa y, so then, of course, it worked out fine and Œ 

Q: Do you know if they sta yed in
 Lithuania
, the 
Belkin
(ph) family? 
A: Well, when the l ady that Œ the l ady that housed them in 
Alytus
, Dr. 
Sta rkus™ 

sister-in-law died, and I went to her funeral there and Mrs. 
Belki n
(ph) was there, I 
think Dr. 
Belkin
(ph) 
by t hen 
was dead. And she died shortly after that, I think. Her 
daughter, the young lady, still survives and she lives in 
Vi lnius
. 

Q: Does she? 

A: And she™s married, you know, lives in 
Vil nius
, has her own fami ly. 

Q: And she still li ves i n

A: Yeah, late 90s, yeah. And then his wife survived for another two years, died in 

Hawaii
, and they™re buried here in 
Los Angeles
. 
Q: Do you know whether or not the y were ever recognized by 
Yad Vashem
, as 
being Righteous Amongst Gentiles? 

A: You know, I used to go to some meetings, you know, and I met a Jewish fellow 

who was part of the organization here, the Holocaust or whatever you call it, here in 

Los Angeles
. 

Q: The 
Museum of Tolerance
? 

A: Yeah, something, you know, he was member of that. And I ki nd of told him the 

story, so he wanted to talk to Dr. 
Sta rkus
. Dr. 
Sta rkus
 refused. He didn't want to 
talk about it. 

Q: Really? 

A: You know, there are some things that happened, I think when the Russians came 

and liberated 
Lithuani a
 from the Germans. B ut Dr. 
Bel kin
(ph) became adoctor in 
Alytus
 in Œ in the prison there. And the lady that I™m talking about  that Œ that 

housed these Œ these people, her husband was arrested and shot there. And the y 

were all upset, you know, that he didn™t help him. They t hink he didn™t help hi m,

m y opinion is he could not help them. But  anyway Œ and so that kind of broke up 
the friendship. 

Q: I see. 

A: Because he participated in the Œ in the execution of Œ of daw Œ of 
Byerchus
(ph).  
Q: What was the name of the family? 
A: 
Byerchus
(ph). 
Q: 
Byerchus
(ph)?  
A: Yeah. 
Q: 
Byerchus

Byerchus
(ph), he was Œ he was caught by t he Russians in a bunker Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ in 
Lit huania
, he was a partisan. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And so somebody, you know, squealed on them, and th Œ and the Russians found 

them and essentially took him in and killed hi m. 

Q: Yeah.

Q: It™s complicated. 
A: So I thi nk that sort of put some friction there, between t he famili es. 

Q: I see. 

A: And I t hink Œ I personally think it™s unjusti fied, because there is nothing he could 

have done. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: But that™s Œ that™s the story there. 

Q: Is Œ 

A: That™s what I know. 

Q: Yes, I understand. Is there anything else that you would like t o add to what 

we™ve spoken about , about these events, these historical events?  You know, what 

kind of inter Œ why your interest was piqued and ma ybe other people™s wasn™t? 
A: Well, I don™t know. I think the fact that when I found out that there was a Jewish 
connection in m y famil y, I Œ I got interested, you know, and tried to track it and I 

couldn™t get  anywhere, in 
Lithuania
. You know, because t he documents were kept 

verypoorly andso on, and 
Œ and so, no I couldn™t track anything down. But, in 
general, I got interested in it, and t he more I read, the more interest ed I got, you 

know, to find out what Œ what went on. And so I Œ I Œ I read quite a few books, you 

know, and Œ and in fact I just finished, some time ago, a book about a thousand

pages which is a di ary of a Jewish lawyer t hat survived al l these wars, and ended up 
in 
Israel
 and then depa Œ and then 
become internationally knownas ala
-lawyer and 
so on. Well , he wrote Œ he preserved most of his diary from those da ys in 
Kaunas 

ghetto. 

Q: Do you remember his name? 
A: No. 
Q: Did you read it in English or in Lithuanian? 

A: In English, in Engli sh, it™s a big book, and I can™t even Œ I think it just says diary 

something. 

Q: Diary of the 
Kovno 
ghetto.  
A: I can find out what was 
[indecipherable]
 But anywa y Œ  
Q: Does the name 
Tory

A: Beg pardon? 

Q: Does the name 
Tory

Œ  
A: Yes! That™s it. 

Q:

A: Well, I learned what  Œ what happened, how the life went on there. Because, you 
know, we didn™t see it, you know. Things went  on 
[indeci pherable]
 
i nside, you 
know, and Œ and we see ok Œ you know, l ike we used to see was groups of Jews 

being escorted from one place to another. That ™s about all we saw, you know, in 

yell ow stars. And as I say, you know, m y mother got stopped because she looked 
Jewish 
[indecipherabl e]
 they want ed to know where her star was. So Œ 
Q: Why do you think some people are interest ed in this i n 
Lithuania
 and other 
peoples aren™t? 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know. I just became i nterested, you know, and the more I 

read, the more interested I got. And so essentially Œ a little while back 

[indecipherable]
 publi shed a little review of a book by t his woman, and I just 

started readi ng it. 
Q: I th
inki t must be
 Ellen Casse
dy™s
 book.  
A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yes, yes, it is. That™s right, that™s what  I have. 

Q: It™s called, ﬁ
We Are Here

A: Yeah, so anywa y, and that 
[indecipherable]
 diary, I gave it to a friend of mine, 
so he is reading it. 

Q: Here in the Lithuani an community? 

A: 
Oh yeah,oh yeah, 
Remus
(ph) 
Kaminskas
(ph), yeah. He is reading it. I think 
that™s who I gave it  to, yeah, I think it™s 
Remus
(ph). So anyway Œ so t hat™s why Œ 
how I developed interest you know, in Œ in following genocide, and t hen especially 

Lithuanian.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: And bei ng quit e aware, in 
Lithuania
 of Œ of mo Œ mo Œ the opinion that people 
spread about the Jews, you know, that™s a Œ and I think it  was pri mari ly jealousy, 

because 
Jews, you know, 
well organized people, the y hel ped each ot her, opened up 
businesses, were successful. And by golly, you know, people sai d well, you know, 
Jews are taking it over. Well, sure t he y taki ng over. Why? Because they work and Œ 
and Œ and Œ  and cr
eat e, and get educated.
 
Q: What would you want Œ 
what would youwant young Lithuani ans in 
Lithuania
 
to know about what went on there? 

A: Well, I t hink that somebody could create a Œ 
a 
Œ a semi nars or something about 

it, but Œ but I™m not sure that it would work. 

Q: Why?
 

 
Interview with Cesare Ugianskis  
 
February 1

87
 
A: Well, you know, I guess now is there™s some guilt in among the Lithuanians, you 
know. Because let™s face it, you know where t he Holocaust started? 

Q: Where?
 
A: 
Lithuania
. 

Q: Really? 
A: Read the Œ read 
that 
Cassedy™s 
book. 
Q: Oka y, okay. 
A: That™s what it tells you. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: That™s where it all started.  

Q: Why do you think it  started in 
Lithuania
? 
A: Well, because they started executing people first, even before the Poles did. 
That™s why.  
Q: I don™t know that Poles executed Jews. I t hink it was just that concentration 

camps were in 
Poland
. 

A: Well, I don™t know, I don™t know. It™s probably Germans with Œ with other help. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: I think t here was a battalion of Lithuani ans that participated in t hat. 

Q: In Œ in 
Poland
?

A: Well, I™m not sure i n 
Poland
, but I know in
 Lithuania
. 
Q: Oh yes, oh yeah, uh-huh.  

A: Yeah, I don™t know about 
Poland
, no I don™t know about 
Pol and
. But 
Œ but 
essentially, years ago, i t was haven for the pol e Œ for the Jews to come, because 

people 
were tolerated.
 And then it became anti-Semitic place because there were so 
many of them there, and they were Œ and they were keeping themselves, you know, 
as a separate class, and then hatred developed. Or I shoul d sa y, you know, 

misunderstanding or whatever you want to cal l, developed between t he two groups, 

because essentially, Jew was not Lithuanian, he was Jew. He just lived here. That ™s 

the wa y they looked. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You know? Even today the y think they look the same way. 
Q: So, I™ll Œ I™ll repeat the question a bit of a different way. If you were sitting here 
with a 16 or a 17 year old Lithuanian kid who™s now growing up on t he streets and 

in the places where all of these things happened, what would you want to tell them? 

Because you were an 11 year old kid when it was happening? 

A: Well, I would ask him if he™s interested to hear about it . 

Q: Oka y.

A: And it he isn™t, I wouldn™t tell hi m anyt hing. You know, how can you tell 
somebody that doesn™t want to listen? 

Q: That™s true. That™s t rue. 

A: So. 

Q: What do you think we need to do in order to have people want  to listen? 
A: Well, you know, I think there™s a process in 
Lithuania 
gai ning Œ getting people 
to Œ to understand the Œ th-the Œ the unity of people to understand the relationship 

among the people
, because 
[ind
eci pherable]
 way, part of the Euro Œ European usa 
Œ union. People are interchanging, people are all mixing. And I think that™s 

assimilation process. And I think that™s Œ that™s gonna hel p. You know, 
Lithuania™s 

losing people to i mmigration. The number of L
ithuanian pop
-population has 

decreased.
 
Q: That™s true. 

A: I think i t™s around 500,000 people have left, out of three million. 

Q: That™s a lot. 

A: That™s a lot 

Q: That™s a lot, yeah. 

A: That™s a lot.

witnessed at the fort, are of such Œ of such a tragedy and, you know, i mport that at Œ 

that™s the sort of thing t hat sta ys wit
h you.
 
A: Well, people are beginning to ignore and forget it. You know, people don™t like 
to remember bad things. 
Q: Yeah. But it™s part of what it Œ it™s part of what happened.
