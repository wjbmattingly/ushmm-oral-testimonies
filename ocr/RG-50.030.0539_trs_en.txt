Question: Good mo rning. 
Answer: Good mo
rning to you. 
Q: This is a 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Museum 
interview with Professor 
Saul Merin
, on April 19
th
, 2009. We are very, very pleased
 that you have agreed to 
come and speak with  us today. The inte
rview is about your life story, and we™ll 
start, as we always do, at
 the beginning. Can you tell 
us some details about your 
birth, about your family, about th
e world that you were born into? 
A: And, thank you 
very much. I-I was born in a 
townsh ip, what they called 
shtet l
, 
the small towns wher
e most Jewish people lived in Eastern
 Europe
. This townsh ip 
was called 
Bendzin
. It had a Œ between 50 and 60
,000 people Œ population. And it 
was simi lar to so many other place
s like this. It was in southwest 
Poland
, very close 
to the German border, of more
 than maybe five miles. 
Q: Was it a contested territory with 
Germany
? 
A: Yes, it was, always they were fighting about it. It was in 
Silesia
, 
Silesia. 
Schilesia
 in Œ in German. And the Germans tho
ught that this is their country . The 
Poles thought that this is their c
ountry. Befo re the war, all of Lower
 Silesia
 was 
next to 
Germany
, and Upper
 Silesia
, most of it belonged to 
Germany
. A small part 
rem-remain ed Polish.

Q: In 
Bendzin
, was it a multi-cultural town? Were
 there Germans living there, and 
Poles living there and Jews living there? 
A: That™s right, but really, the majority were Jewish 
people, in the town itself. 
Q: How large was Œ 

A: About 60 percent. 
About 60 percent of the people living in 
Bendzin
 were Œ were 
Jewish people. And they Œ their language mo stly was Jewish. 

Q: Yiddish. 
A: Yiddish. 
Q: Yiddish. 

A: Was Yiddish . While a Œ in addition, th
ey learned Po lish, and knew Po lish, but 
Yiddish was the major language. And there 
were people who lived there and spoke 
German. 

Q: What about you? 

A: We spoke Yiddish. And Œ at home, it wa
s Yiddish. I knew, of course, very well, 
Polish. And I knew a little of German, not 
much. But I learned German during the 
war, and after the war, as a child. 

Q: And how is it Œ how was the town™s stru
cture in social classes, for example? 
Were Œ were Jews in a certain merchant cla
ss, or a certain class and Poles in another 
and Germans in another? 
How was that split up? 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

A: The whole town  was poor. Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in  
town . Poverty among all classes. It was 
among Germans and among Œ among Poles, 
and among the Jewish people. The Œ the pov
erty was ma nifested by Œ by the houses, 
which were terrible dwellings. Many of 
them, there were no washrooms in the 
house, they have to go out to
 th e courty ard. So metimes th
is was seen even in Œ in 
houses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 
families lived there. 
They had to go down 
and Œ life was not easy, not nice. Jewish pe
ople lived there probably for longer than 
many other places, because in 
Bendzin
 there was a castle, which was built by King
 
Casimir
.
 Ca simir
, or 
Kazimierz
 in Polish. 
Kazimierz
 the Great. He was the Polish 
king in the 14
th
 centu ry  who united 
Poland.
 This is why they called him the Great. 
After he united it, usually by 
fighting, okay, in comb at Œ 
Q: Was that the Treaty of 
Lublin?
 Was he part Œ 
A: No. 
Q: No, okay. 
A: No. This was Œ a-and he Œ he
 really thought Œ he ruled over
 Poland
. This was 
unusual in
 Poland
, because 
Poland 
was Œ the noblemen rule Œ ruled the country, 
not the king. Bu t he was strong; he was the one who ru led at that time, in the 14
th
 
century, mu st have been about 
1345. He invited the Jews of 
Germany
 to come over 
and live in 
Poland
. And he promised that he will ta
ke care of it Œ of them, he will 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

support them, and th Œ especially, he will 
be the one who will defend them, if there 
will be problems about Œ in Œ in 
Poland
. The Jews heard it and they just couldn™t 
come at a b etter time for the Poles, and 
for the Jews, cau se this was the time after 
the plague, after the plague, disease, the 
plague epidemic, the Black Plague. While 
the Germans, which Œ which maybe Œ n
obody knows how much, but it probably 
was not less than a quarter of the Œ of Eu
ropean population who perished at that 
time from the disease, from the epidemic
, and they possibly wa Œ it came up from 
50 percent a Œ of the jew Œ of the Europ
ean population. The plague was brought by 
an Italian ship from the east,
 from somewhere in the east
. The story goes, in 1943, 
the Œ the ship came and they
 tried to disembark in 
Messina, 
in south 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Not 1943, some pa Œ some other point, yes? 

A: In 1343. 

Q: ‚43. 
A: 1343. And in 
Messina
, the customs officer came on 
the ship and looked what 
kind of, how do you call it Œ  
Q: Goods they had? 
A: Goods, what kind of goods they  brough
t with them. And then he has seen th-the 
sick sailors. He has seen this, he left th
e ship. He told them, you are not allowed to

go to 
Messina
, you must leave immediately the po
rt. And they left and they went 
around in to
 Venice.
 In
 Venice
 they  disemb arked.  
Q: That was it. 
A: Brought down th e goods. And unfortuna
tely, one of the problems was, later for 
the Jews, that one of the businessmen in 
Switze rland
 had a Jew for his assi sta n t. 
And Œ so rry. 
Q: It™s okay. 
A: And he was sent to 
Venice
 to bring the goods. And he
 came  over there and took 
the goods and came back to 
Switzerland
. The goods were infected, like all of the 
goods which were 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: This is Œ excuse me for 
interrupting, but it™s interestin
g to hear history Œ first of 
all, I™ll back up a little bit. 
I have a theory, it™s a not ve
ry deep theory
, it™s a little 
superficial, but I have a theory that east
 Europeans carry around their history for 
600 years. 
A: That™s right. 
Q: Whereas American s don™t remember what 
Vietnam
 War was: that™s already 
ancient history. 
A: How right you are. 
Q: And listening to you now, I hear 
an east European, because Œ because Œ

A: This was just 600 years Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ from that time. 
Q: And Œ and I™m wondering wh ether Œ wh
ether these were stories and this was 
history that you grew  up with in a Œ in
 order to explain how the Jews came to 
Bendzin
, or is this Œ  
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ info rmation that you learned la
ter, history that you learned later? 
A: No, it was Œ no, I th Œ I think I knew ab
out it already as a child. I knew about it, 
because it™s very important forthe life of Jewish people in 
Bendzin
. You see, when 
the plague broke out, the Germans accuse
d the Jews, that th
ey brought in the 
plague, that they caused the 
plag ue, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of 
the European population, and th ousand
s of Jews were massa cred as a Œ 
Q: Result. 
A: Œ result of this. And wh en he invited th
e Jews to come, tens of thousands left 
Germany
 into 
Pola nd. Poland
, til then, had one 
small community in 
Kalish
(ph), a 
town more to the north 
[indecipherable]
. And after this there were many 
communities which were put up. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009

Q: So you could sa Œ 
so one could say that 
Bendzin
 was one of the oldest Jewish 
communities in 
Poland . 
A: Yes, that™s what I think, yes. This wa 
Œ this was what we knew ab out it. This was 
one of the oldest Œ becau
se Jews settled near the 
king they loved. And Œ 
Q: This is the other point I wanted to 
bring up, th Œ and again, excuse me for 
interrupting, but it sounds from what you™re 
saying, is that there are traces of a 
Polish patriot in you, in your 
telling, because of Œ now, I c
ould be wrong, I™m Œ this 
is why I™m testing this out, because it sounds
 like the story was a favorable story to 

Pola nd , 
that it was a refuge, that it was a country where one could live. It was a 

country that offered survival and reprieve. 
And the reason I Œ I Œ I bring this up is 
that just recently there was a 
Professor
 
Polonsky
 who was the chair of Judaic 
studies at 
Brandeis
, gave a presentation where he
 said, until World War 2, many 
Jews believed that about 
Poland
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Many Jews believed that about where 
they lived. And so that™s why I™m asking 
you, is that Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ is there something to this? 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
10
A: Yes, I agree fully with th
is. Many Jews believe that 
they are Œ they are Jewish, 
but they  Œ th at the Poles can be depended 
upon, and we should li
ve with the Poles. 
Th-This happened at the time of 
Tadeusz Ko
˚
ciuszko
, when 
Berek 
Yoselevich
(ph)
,
 a Jew from 
Warsaw
, from the other side of 
Warsaw, Fraha Œ 
Fraga
(ph). He put up a battalion th
at fought in the mutiny of 
Ko
˚
ciuszko,
 as a 
separate battalion under Œ under 
the order of Œ of yos Œ of 
Berek Yoselevich
(ph)
, 
Berek
 
Yoselovich
. And Poles that remember this, 
will find his name anywhere oret 
Œ of how he fought. He fell in Œ in comb at
. He died in  comb at. But he dus Œanyhow, 
in Œ in
 Bendzin
, most Jews went to 
Kraków. Kraków 
was the place where the king 
lived, and they put up a town near 
Kraków
 and called it 
Kazimierz,
 which is this 
still today, after the king. But in this plac
e, the castle which he built, on the shores 
of a river, he Œ this town was built, 
Bendzin,
 and Jews lived there, I think for 
centuries. I lived in 
the place where I was born, and 
I lived on the street corner 
called the 
Street of the Castle
. And I could throw a stone and hit the castle, it was 
in the same Œ 
Q: That was that close? 

A: It was very close, yes. It was o n  the same street. 
Q: Did you live di Œ were you 
born into one of those hous
es that had four stories 
high, and a courty ard below? 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
11
A: Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly like th
is. For there were three, like buildings 
around a courtyard, and I lived on the third 
floor in  one of them, on the Œ the site 
where there was no building lik
e this, there was a small building of three stores 
only, or what do Œ what Œ shops in th
e lower floor, and then two floors of 
apartments, which belonge
d to my grandfather. 
Q: So, it was extended family who lived together? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Let™s turn a little bit to your own fam
ily, within this cont
ext, within this 
community and within this history. When
 were you born? What was the date of 
your birth? 

A: 1933. August, 1930 Œ 
end of August, 1933. 
Q: August? 
A: 1933. 

Q: But the date in Augu
st was Œ I Œ August Œ 
A: 25. 

Q: August 25
th
, 1933. Were you the only child?  
A: No, my sister was 
born two years later. 
Q: But there were the two of you then? 

A: Yes.

Q: Okay . And what was her name? 
A: 
Dina. 
Q: 
Nina
? 
A: 
Dina.
 
Q: 
Dina
. And your parents™ names? 
A: My father was 
It zh ak, It zhak, 
and he belo nged  to the fami ly
 Merin
, that lived 
in this place, at least d o cu
mented, I know, 200 years. 
Q: That™s a long time. 

A: Yeah, 200 Œ 1820, I 
could see the name of 
Merin
 written down in the Jewish 
community, where they had the list of a
ll newborns, you know, and saw his name, 
the name
 Merin
 came back Œ back several times. 
Q: And your mother™s name? 

A: My  mo  Œ  my  mo ther was 
Gruen, g-r-u-e-n
, that™s the way Œ 
Q: 
Gruen
? 
A: 
Gruen. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That™s the way they have written it. 
It™s probably more German, like this, the 
u-
e
. 
Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
13
A: And they  Œ 
Q: Her first name? 

A: Œ she was born in  Œ 
Gitl
(ph)
. 
Q: 
Gitl
(ph)
. 
A: Okay . She was born in a village near
by, a village about 20 
miles from there.  
Q: In this Œ in
 Bendzin
, if there was such poverty, what did people do to make their 
Œ earn their living? How did they earn their living? 
A: I think it was lot different from other places in
 P o la nd.
 They lived there as 
owners of small shops. This was Œ my  fath
er had a small shop given to him by his 
father, by my  grandfather. And he became 
very religious, and Œ and my  mo ther was 
really running it. And I Œ 
Q: What did you sell? What Œ 

A: They were selling all kinds of Œ they called it 
galanteria 
in Polish. 
Q: How Œ and Œ 
A: You know, okay Œ 
Q: And Œ  

A: So th is was a 
galanteria
. Was a big sign
 galanteria, 
I remember this as a child. 
Q: All kinds of haberdashery
, I think would be the Englis
h phrase. Sock s and gloves 
and umbrellas and things like that. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
14
A: Yes, that™s right. 
Q: Yeah, hats.  

A: That™s right. So this was one owners
, shop owners. Then 
there were various 
professions, like tailors and 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ 
Q: Do you think that that wo
uld have been your fu ture, 
had there been no war, that 

you would have ta
ken over the shop? 
A: Oh, that™s a difficult question. I was too 
young to Œ to even Œ 
to think about it. I 
believe my father would like me to go to
 the yeshiva and beco me a rabbi, or like 
this, but it will Œ there was no chance for it, 
I would never agree to it. Already as a 
child five year old, I knew that that will not be my way. 
Q: That™s interesting that at age five Œ 
A: Yes. At the age of three, I was sent to a 
chayder,
 so I learned with all these ren Œ 
religious way, I learned from the age of thre
e. I hated. This I remember well. I did 
not like it.  
Q: Why? What Œ what
 is in your memory? 
A: I didn't like the attitude of the ra
bbi. The rabbi was the teacher over there 
[indecipherable] 
on many occasion he would hit you with a Œ  
Q: Ruler? 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
15
A: Œ a ruler, you know, which he had there,
 in his hand. A Œ and I hated it. And I 
did not like the way they were learning it, 
you know, to repeat after the rabbi what 
he said, and this was the way of learning.
 I didn™t like it. This I know very well. 
And on any occasion I had, I 
wou Œ I run away from them. 
Q: Well, three years old is a very y
oung Œ for a small child to be so Œ  
A: Yes, I probably started to run aw ay at th
e age of four or so, after one year there. 

Not at the beginning, but already at the ag
e of four I was definitely running away. 
My Œ 

Q: Did you get in trouble from this? 

A: Well, I tried to Œ not to let my pare
nts know about it. But my  mother would 
certainly support me if I would Œ if she 
would know, she would 
say, well, let him do 
what he likes. And my father woul
dn™t forg ive me, no way. And so Œ 

Q: That™s kind of to
ugh on a little child. 
A: Yes. But, it was Œ my friend was the Œ there was a man who lived in the same 
house, he had a cart and a horse to carry 
things. And he became Œ we became very 
good friends, and he tried to take me alwa
ys when  he was going to work , and I was 
with him on the cart there, going like this. 
The other people Œ so  there there were all 
these professions, there were Œ was a bake
ry, and people worked in the bakery. 
There was a 
mikveh
, and a synagogue, a shul, where they Œ and so many people are 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
16
Œ were all in this. The most Œ the most 
comm on, I would say, and the mo st Jewish 
profession Œ you probably don™t know it, 
but the mo st Jewish profession at that 
time, my  opinion, was porters. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yes. These people were 
taking things on th eir shou
lders and carry them from Œ 
they were Jewish, almost exclusively Jewish. 

Q: Like load ers, people who would ta
ke heavy sacks on th eir shoulders and Œ 
A: Yes, heavy loads and these were Je
wish. Almo st exclusively. We knew it Œ 
Q: How do you explain it? 

A: Well, th-the problem was that the Po
les didn™t like Jews, and you know, if we 
liked King
 Kazimierz
, there were not many like hi
m. And he Œ he Œ he was 
exceptional. And the Poles tried to make, fo
r Jews, life difficult. And one of things 
they did was not to Œ too mu ch to work  
with them. Now, if you were a doctor, if 
you were a Œ a tailor, and you 
were good at it, and really they came to you, most 
Jews and Po les, and Œ and they  wo rked  
with you, because it was good fo r them to 
do it. Bu t if you didn™t have any educatio
n, if you didn™t ha
ve any professional 
education, you were not a tailor, you were not a 
[indecipherable]
 you didn™t learn 
anything, then the only th
ing that was left fo r you was to work as a porter. 
Q: Carrying these loads. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
17
A: And I Œ I think th is was the reason why 
they work. I knew Œ I knew children of 
the porters who were my age. I remember
 them. They had the 
very difficult time. 
Their income was low. They 
hardly could have shoes to walk around with  them. 
And I Œ I™m not sure how mu  Œ what th
ey  were doing about it, you know, and 
certainly their parents, unedu
cated. They  couldn™t do an ything else, except this.  
Q: Was there mandatory schoolin
g for children, all children? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. Schooling is another 
interesting fact about the place, because there was one 
secondary  school, one high school, and the 
one high school was Œ my  father learned 
in it. Was called 
Yavener
(ph) at the time, an d the language of teaching was 
Hebrew. This was the only secondary school
, high school in town. So the Poles Œ 
Q: So the Poles didn™t have their own? 

A: No. 
Q: There was no education Œ 
A: I Œ I™m not sure they have now, but th
ey didn™t have at that time. This was the 
only one. And so  wh en a Pole wanted 
to learn in high school, would get 
matriculation, for instance, the on
ly way for him was to learn in 
Hebrew. 
Go to that 
school Œ 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

18
Q: And did they? 
A: Yes, ma ny did. Many did. It was 
[indecipherable] 
a Œ a Œ a chain of schools, 
Jewish schools, all over 
Poland. 
Q: But private, hm, not state. 

A: Private Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ priv ate. But then, you know, life be
came very difficult, worse and worse from 
year to year.  

Q: Well, I would like to see Œ I would like 
to kind of weave in the general picture 

you™re painting for me with words, to 
what happened in  y
our own family. And 
before we do that, I™d like to get a se
nse of what your family was like, what 
memo ries do you have of your family, of 
your sister, of your mo ther. You know, 
some people report that their pre-war lives we
re pretty idyllic, and 
that they grew up 
in warm, happy families. Some report that
 it wasn™t quite so, and their relations 
were more, how shall I say? Complicated
. How would you describe your own? 
A: Whe-en-en Œ if we speak before the war Œ 
Q: Before the war. 
A: Œ befo re the world changed Œ 
Q: Before the war. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
19
A: Œ before the war I was Œ I was five ye
ars old when  the war broke out, I wasn™t 
yet six. 
Q: I see. 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 so during that time, I could 
only see what™s going around 
there. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And already I knew at that time that
 what happens in town , and all over in 
Pola nd , 
because I heard my parents speakin
g about it, the anti-Semitism grew 
quickly. It became mo nstrous, I think, be
fore breakout of 
the second World War. 
Q: Did your parents talk about
 what happened to them, or 
to people they knew, or Œ 

A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Yes, I heard them talking about it. 
They Œ the Œ the majo
r problem was that 
Poles organized into a Œ a Œ in 
Œ in the party, which was called 
Boycott. 
Q: Ah. 

A: And this was, really , this was their pur
pose, to boycott the 
Jews. And then  they 
meant Œ fewer people came to the store to 
buy there. They could find a Po lish store, 
not Jewish. I Œ I don™t know if you have ev
er seen, there is a book e Œ of pictures, 
published in  
New York
, by
 Vishniac
.

20
Q: Oh yes, mm-hm. 
A: Have you seen it? 

Q: 
Roman Vishniac,
 yes.  
A: 
Roman Vishniac.
 It™s amazing. When you see 
[indecipherable]
 you can see the 
porters, who were the ones who suffered most
 of the Polish boycott, because they, 
you know, have Œ a Pole c
ould take a load on his shoulders without learning 

anything, and take it over. And they su
ffered, the famine really, that™s Œ 
Q: Did you Œ 

A: Œ

starvation, there was. 
Q: So you would see the effects of it, 
you would see the children of the Œ of the 
loaders. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you yourself, or your fami ly, or 
the Œ the housing comp lex wh ere you lived, 
was it almost entirely Jewish? Did you 
have interaction with Poles wi Œ 
A: Entirely Jewish. 
Q: Entirely Jewish. 

A: Yes. The school, my father learned in th
is high school, until just one year before 
the end, when he said, I don™t want to
 continue here, I want to go to a 
yeshiva
. And 
he left this and started the religious trai
ning. And several years later he married my

mother, and she came from th

[indecipherable]
 
Q: What was Œ what was its name? 
A: Mika Œ was 
Sztem a szitsa

[indecipherable]
 
Q: Oh my God, how do you say it? 
A: 
Sztemaszitsa
(ph) 
Q: 
Sztemaszitsa
(ph)? Oh my  gosh. 
A: Yes. 
[indecipherable]
 I am saying. There were 2,00
0 Jews in this village, quite 
large. There were mats Œ but they were s
till only 15 percent of th
e population of this 
village. But I loved it, because this was open,
 and I could run around there. I had the 
large family, all my mother™s fam
ily lived there, this was great. 
Q: Were you closer to her than to him? 

A: Yes, I believe, yes. I Œ I loved my  mo th
er. And I didn™t like my  father being so Œ 

Q: Strict. 
A: Œ strict and religio us and ja Œ I didn
't  like. You know, wh
en  Œ when you th ink 
about life over there before the war, that™s 
certainly on the one side, it™s the poverty, 
which became worse in 1930s, after my birt
h, when I was a sma
ll child. With every 
year it became worse for the Jews because 
of this, I mean, because of the boycott, 
because of what Poles did. And Œ but on 
the other hand, you Œ 
you must Œ it was a

life you could enjoy, with all this. You 
know, you had something to expect, you 
know, you didn™t have enough
. I think nobody, really, excep
t some rich people, they 
didn™t have enough bread. They would eat 
mo re bread if they would be given. Bu t 
they knew  that in another 10 days, 
Pesach 
comes, Passover. And then they will eat 
as mu ch as they want. Or another holid ay
, or the Sabbath. Was no way, even the 
poorest people, that on the Sabbath they would not Œ th e whole family would not sit 
down and eat, really as one should. You 
know, no way. They would be ashamed of 
it. They wouldn't  be ashamed during th e we
ek  that they cannot give their children 
enough to eat, but on the Sa
bbath they would certainly 
be ashamed of, and they  
would do anything, you know,
 on Sabbath and the holiday
s, that they did Œ the 
behavior of the family is di
fferent, and they can Œ and this was really  every Friday, I 
was going already as a four ye
ar old child. I was taking the

there as a small child. My father stopped 
to go there earlier. A
nd in the town there 
was one Jew called 
Furstenberg
. 
Q: Oh, that™s a very ar-aristocratic name. 
A: Yes, without the 
von. 
Q: Okay . 
A: 
Furstenberg
. And 
Furstenberg
 was a very rich Jew, but very. Very means that 
in the 1930s he had an airplane, a priv
ate airplane, which you know, unheard of. 
Q: That™s 
Hollywo od
. 
A: He was one of the richest people in all of 
Euro pe
. He became rich from a Œ from 
a mine which he founded, of 
zinc. And he Œ this was really
 the Œ th e center of zinc 
export to all of
 Euro pe.
 So he Œ he took on himself 
the whole school. They  changed 
the name of the school to 
Furstenb erg
 and he was paying for 
[indecipherable]
 all 
the teachers, and thing, was paid by him. 

Q: He was the benefactor. 
A: He was the benefactor of the school and everything 
[indeciphera ble]
 after it.

A: Just Œ just Œ yes, right. 

Q: Œ ™39. 

A: Right, right. 

Q: How does a six year old boy experience
 a war? What was the Œ how did Œ how 
did it introduce itself in to your life? 
A: Frightening. It™s Œ I-I was never afraid
 of anything. I believed that I was never 
afraid in my life, there™s nothing that 
I could not overcome. 
But it was frightening 
because of the Œ of the peop
le around me, you know. Th
ey were obviously afraid. 
And I could feel it, I could see it.  

Q: You were six years old, and these we
re the grown-ups, and the grown-ups were 
the ones Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ who provide security to the children. 

A: That™s right.

25
A: That™s right, that™s right, that™s ri
ght. I never expressed it, and the Œ nobody 
would know it, but definitely it was clear
. When the Germans 
came in, which was 
immediately after the war broke out
, they  didn't have much to go. 
Q: That™s right acro
ss the border, yeah. 
A: Just acr oss the border. The 
first Saturday after this, th
ey came and burned down 
the shul, the synagogue. And th ey burned it 
down with all the people were praying 
inside. And whoever tried to escape was shot.  
Q: It must ha Œ I mean
, was there any crime in
 Bendzin
 before the war? 
A: No. 
Q: So this was Œ this is a shock to the system. 
A: That™s Œ yes, yes. They
 were Œ we lived on this 
Castle
 Street, which was on the 
same street, a little further, there was the 
synagogue, the central synagogue of the 
town. 
Q: Did you see anything of this? 
A: And the Œ I don™t know, I was Œ at th
e time, on Saturday wh
en they burned it 
down, they came and th
en they  announced to all peopl
e around in the other houses 
to stay down in the baseme
nts. So we went down. Wh en  we came back we have 
seen some shots in the ceiling of Œ wh en 
th ey Œ they  shoot around just to frighten 
people, you know. But Œ

Q: Did you see any German soldie
rs? Do you reme mb er seeing any? 
A: Yes. No-Not at that time. On that day 
I couldn™t see any, but yes, I have seen 
them.  
Q: After Œ 
A: They came in, and after this, and Œ 

Q: But then it was just sort 
of like this Œ if I can try 
and Œ and extrapolate, a Œ a 
child is hearing Œ is Œ is sens
ing the fear of the adults, does not yet see what it is that 
they are frighten ed of, is told
 that, along with his family to
 go to a basement, and at 
that time, it™s when 
the synagogue is being burnt down
 with people inside. Did you 
hear anything from what was going on down the street? 
A: It was a noise there. We heard that 
it™s burning. I heard them talking about it, 
that they burned down the 
synagogue. We didn't think th
at this happens with the 
people inside. And there were s-some su
rvivors from it, succeeded
 to run away, and 
they went to a nearby church . And the prie
st of the church really hid them, he was 
hiding th em. He later be Œ received a Œ 
a Œ what they call 
it at the Holocaust 
mu seum of 
Jerusalem
 Œ

A: Righteous of the world. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Righteous, he Œ this Œ he definitely sa
ved. Many of them were killed later, but at 
least he did what, really the on
ly one who did anything for it. 
Q: Really? 

A: And Œ at that time. So Œ 

Q: So Œ 
A: Y-You know, and after this, when 
the Germans, after burning down  the 
synagogue it became a little quieter. Youknow, there was not
hing going on. Well, 
here and there some, I would 
say, things not on the leve
l of the whole town. Like, 
for instance, I learned at home. I never we
nt to  school. And in  1940, my  parents 
brought a Jewish young wo man, was teaching me Polish. How to  write, how to 
read, and Œ 

Q: Is she the one who taught you history? Because if Œ 
A: No, no, no. She was Œ and 
she was really not a long ti
me. I liked her very much, 
I still remember this. 
Q: Do you reme mb er her name? 
A: I was six Œ no, no. Six or
 maybe seven years old, sh
e was older. She looked to 
me the perfect lady, you know, th-the perfect
 girl, which could be I looked at her, I 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

was waiting for her coming every time. Then 
one day Œ and she learned. I mean, sa 
Œ I learned how to write in maybe a coup
le of months when she was teaching me. 
Then  she didn™t come. And I asked my  parent
s what happened, they didn™t want to 
tell me. And then I heard that, one day a ta
lk between them, and one of them saying 
that her parents are accusing my  parents about what happened. And then I 
understood what happened. Wh en  she left
 our house after teaching me, she went 
back to her home. Sh e had to cross a la
wn which was on the way, quite a large 
lawn, and when  she went th
rough it a German soldier went by and just shot her, 
killed her on the way. I-I Œ I remember, when
 I heard this, I was shocked by it. First 
time in my life that I really
 started to understand what™s
 going on with the Germans 
in that time. All schools were of course closed, and there was no way, even 

religious schools, like I learned in the 
chayder,
 so I could like, continue, up to a 
certain time when the Œthe rabbi was taken to 
Auschwitz
. And I start in another 
place and the rabbi also was taken away a 
short time later, and there was no way to 
learn. I started my  school only a-after the war.  

Q: What happened with your mo ther™s 
galanteria
? Obviously, even before the war, 
it mu st have suffered. Did you have
 Polish customers before the war? 
A: One Œ and, yes, undoubte
dly, mo st customers were 
Polish. Nearby was a shop, a 
butch er, and the butcher was Polish, it was not kosher. But my  grandfather rented it

for Œ to Œ to him, and he Œ he m Œ he wa
s bankrupt. And this wa
s the way they lived 
until the war broke out in Œ at the end 
of 1939, beginning 
of 1940, we were 
informed that the house of my  grandfather is 
[indecipherable]
 too much into the 
street. And so they had to 
leave it in 24 hours, and they
 demolished it, the German Œ 
not the Germans, but the people who wo rked
 for them, and Œ including the Jewish. 
Q: So th at meant that in this Œ was th
is house owned by your 
grandfa-father? In 
other wo rds, it was his asset, it was his property? 
A: Yes, yes, yes.  
Q: Completely destroyed? 

A: Oh, th e whole house was destroyed, yes.  This was his major property, he lived 
on th is because he rented this Œ the shops 
downstairs and Œ and he
 rented the other Œ 
th-the other apartments. He 
lived in one of them, and he rented the other, four or 
five other.  
Q: Tell me a little bit about this grandfather. 
Did you ha Œ di
d Œ did he play a role in 
your life, in your childhood? Do  you rememb er, or was he a mo re distant person? 

A: H-He was Œ no, he was like a grandfat
her. When I was born, probably in  that 
time, my  parents didn't have an ap artmen
t of their own, th
ey lived with the 
grandfather. I was born there, this I wa
s told. Then they m
oved over to this 
apartment. H-H-He was Œ he was like a 
zayde
 should be, you know, like a 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

grandfather, a 
zayde 
should be. He was the one alwa
ys prepared fo
r me so meth i n g  
which I liked. And so I loved him, I l
oved him in that time. Like, you know Œ 
Q: Of course. 
A: Œ mo st grandsons would Œ would love
. He was the one, o-or maybe it was 1941, 
it was already becoming very  bad. The 
pressure was risin g  all the time. Was 
standing on the balcony of the Œ of the hous
e and he said to me, you see, when this 
war will end, we are going to 
Palestine
. It w as Œ for the firs
t time I heard the word
 
Palestine.
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. I had an  uncle there. His son. He was the oldest son, went to 
Tel Aviv
, 
and then there were four sisters,  a
nd then my father 
was the youngest.  
Q: This was a large family. 

A: Yes Œ 

Q: Quite a large family . 
A: Œ there was. 
Q: So you had lo
ts of aunts. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And did they all live Œ 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

31
A: I liked the Œ all of them, I liked them. Ye
s, they were all of 
them married. I liked 
them all. 
Q: And they were all in this apar
tment building? This
 Œ this house Œ 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: No. 
A: They all left, they married and after Œ 
Q: So it was only your father Œ 

A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Œ who kind of stayed wi Œ closer Œ 

A: Yes, to the grandfather. 

Q: Œ to the grandfather. 

A: Yes, but when  they demo lished his hous
e, we couldn™t take him in because our 
apartment was small. So we moved over to
 the place of my  aunt, the oldest aunt 
who lived in the 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Bendzin
. She had the la
rge apartment. 
Q: These things sound terrifying, when  I Œ I mean they sound terrifying at any age, 
but I am just trying to imagin
e still, a child of six and se
ven years old. Ho w did your 
parents explain, or try to explain to yo
u wh at was going on? Di
d they  Œ did they  

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
32
comfort you, or were they so worried with
 their own fears that you kept quiet about 
your own? 
A: We spoke very little about it, if at all, if
 at all. They never, 
ever, ever, ever spoke 
with me about it, really. And th e truth is that
 I think th ey Œ they were clever to do it, 

not to tell me anything, because it certain
ly frightened  me, there™s no doubt about 
this. But they knew wh at™s going on in  my  
head, you know. They  
knew that I live a 
Œ in an imaginary world. And all this just
 kind of doesn™t belo
ng to me, and they 
knew it. And I rememb er my father saying 
to me, we™re going down
 to try to open 
the 
sukka h
. The 
sukka h
 for Œ a 
sukka h.
 And they said to 
me, you know, and I was 
trying to explain to him, because there Œ th
ere were several things he couldn™t do. 
He was not allowed to go at 
[indecipherable]
 outside, he had to put it in this Œ 
which is not according to the 
religious laws and the Œ there™s several things, also 
with the 
sukka h
, he couldn™t put this wa
y, he had to put it in another way, and he 
said that™s not the way it s
hould be done, it should be Œ 
and then  he looked at me 
and he said, you know, I envy 
you. It™s good to  be a child at this time . You know, 
when  Œ he knew I am living in  an imagin
ary world, which is not the world of 

[indecipherable]
 during th e war. And I think this was the way, really, you could 
keep yourself normally. 

Q: How about your little sister? S h e was truly 
a baby, wasn™t she, at that point, still? 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
33
A: Yes, she was a baby, and I felt like th
is was always, for me she was the baby. 
And I always think I told her, look, I will ta
ke care of you, y
ou don™t be afraid, I 
will always take care of you. And th
at™s really what happened later. 
Q: So let™s Œ 
A: I took care of her. 

Q: I want to get to that point.  

A: Yeah. 
Q: Tell me, after you Œ after your grandf
ather™s house was demo lished, how did 
things proceed, how did life continue to ch ange?  
A: So my  grandparents moved over to her, 
my  grandfather died later in the Œ and 
I™m not sure, but possib Œ certainly from natu
ral causes, but it™s also probable that 
he didn™t get the treatment which he 
could get if there wouldn't be a war. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: He died, and we continued to live. Th-T he main problem was how to get away 
from the Germans, that they don™t catch yo
u when  they  go in  the streets and catch 
some Jews to send away. And there were 
several cases when it was organized. One 
day it was organized this way, that they 
came to surround our place, all the fo ur 
build ings. And they  took ev erybody to  the po
lice statio n, or whatever it was, and Œ 

and they  said Œ they  decided, wh atever one 
of you is going back  to his house, or is 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

34
sent over for deportation, as they called it. Deportation was 
Auschwitz
. 
Auschwitz
 
was not more than about an hour by train fro
m our place. And so, at that time, we 
learned something. And we learned this, th
at they Œ they are taking away larger 
families, because it™s easier 
for them. If they have to ta
ke, they come over in there 
to bring a thousand Jews, they take larger  families, then they 
do it quicker and it™s 

for them much easier. We su
rviv ed this because what happened is that a Jewish 
policeman was there, they
 were helping the Œ the 
Germans. And they  were 
policemen of the 
Judenrat
. And the Jewish policeman 
was a distant relative of 
ours. So  he said, you don™t ta
ke Œ stay here. Went out a
nd locked the ou
ter lock on 
the door. So it was clear to everybody who 
came over there, ther
e is nobody inside, 
they left already an
d locked the door. 
Q: Did people know that they
 were being Œ go Œ going to 
Auschwitz
, or did they 
just know th ey™re being deported? 

A: Not at that time. T h ey we
re Œ they knew they were de
ported, and not at that time. 
Later on, yes. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: Later Œ 
Q: Was there a ghetto formed Œ 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

35
Q: Œ in your town, in
 Bendzin
? 
A: Much later. 
Q: I see. 
A: Much later. Was just at the en d of ™42 that
 they oh Œ in ™42, 
one day, this was the 
second time after this, that they called all Je
ws to the stadium. 
And in the stadium, 
after a whole day 
[indecipherable]
 waiting, and th Œ everyb
ody had to go through a 
station where Gestapo was sitting, and they de
cided every one, if he is going to be 
deported, or he is going back. 
Q: Did you reme mber that, did you go? 

A: A-And Œ yes, I do reme mb er it, very we
ll. Because what I did was Œ and I did it 
myself, I h ad my Œ when Œ when my parents 
with my sister came over to the table, I 
kind of hid ara Œ behind them. So here se
ems three people, and he stamped the Œ the 
I.D.s and he gave it to them, then he has seen a fourth I.D.
 
He looked around and 
see me and what™s that 
[indecipherable]
 cause then it woul
d be already you 
couldn't change it any mo re. But they told  
me later, the parents that I saved them, 
because families of four, they
 were deported, and only 
smaller families not. So my 
hiding behind it, and so they Œ they  
manifested only 
th ree me mb ers.   
Q: And then the fourth seems to show
 up, but the stamp is already there Œ 
A: Yes. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

36
Q: Œ and so he™s allow Œ you know, one more reprieve. 
A: Yeah, yeah. So they Œ th
ey gave it to me, they le
t me  out. Then th e Œ a man 
came, a Œ a distant relative of mine. You 
know, I had maybe Œ I counted for si Œ 
Kaddish somewhere, maybe tomo rrow, I count
ed  Œ I had first relatives, first degree 
relatives, u p  to first cousins, there must
 have been some 25. And we speak about 
distant relat ives, more distant, sec o nd
 cousins, so once Œ first cousins once 
removed, we™re coming to maybe 200.  
Q: What a lot Œ 
A: Was a very large family. The name 
Merin  
is very Œ i-it was very popular there. 
Must tell you, it™s not really for this, but yo
u know, once in 10 years I have to renew 
my visa to the 
United States. 
Last time when it was, I had 
to Œ well, usually I give 
it to the agent, to the travel
 agent, and he does it for me
. Now, they changed the law, 
and the ru les, and now you have
 to come yourself and be there. Takes half a day. I 
didn't  have time for it. So I was angry ab
out it, well, you cannot do anything. I came 
over there, it was four months ago. And 
I come in there and they Œ I was waiting 
with the others, and I come to a large ha
ll where I™ve seen peopl
e waiting, they said, 
this takes the most time. You mu
st wait here until they  call you. 
Q: Was this the 
U.S.
 embassy in Œ in
 Israel
? 
A: The

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ I went to the consulate in 
Jerusalem
. And they said, this 
may take two or three 
hours to hear. The minute when  I come in, I sat down. 
Merin .
 I said to my wife, 
something wrong here, it cannot 
be. All these people were before us. But I come in 
there, a woman is sitting there, at one of 
the windows, smiling. And she says to me, 
you are 
Merin
? I say yes. You are from 
Bendzin
? I says, what do you mean? 
That™s not written there. So, 
she said, my father is from
 Bendzin
, and he told me if 
at any time somebody named
 Merin
 will come, take him immediately, he is from
 
Bendzin
. And this was her. 
Q: How wonderful. 

A: Yeah, was funny.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: You know, like Œ 
Q: Did you know wh
o her father was?

A: Œ I was so small.  
Q: Yes. 

A: I knew many 
Merins
, but not Œ in 1942, a man came
 back, a distant relative of 
ours, and he had the broken hand, I reme mb
er. And he told  us that he was on the 
way to 
Auschwitz
, and he jump ed out of the trai
n. And he broke his hand, and Œ 
and th-this, but came back. And I remember
 him sitting down with my parents and I 
was listening from the side and I heard him telling about 
Auschwitz
, what it means 
Auschwitz
 and what Œ that they 
are killing Jews there.  
Q: And you were nine years old? 

A: I was nine years, yes. When Œ when 
he left, I heard my father and mother 
speaking, they were angry. 
They said, he is lying. It  cannot be that this is 
happening. It™s really Œ it™s a pity that he
 is saying things lik
e this, which are not 
true, he™s frightening everybody. This wa
s the attitude. There were a few people 
like him, but they didn't believe it. I thi
nk that this is probably th e basis for not 
doing mo re to defend themselves, of th
e Jews, because it seemed so unreal, so 
impossible, that anybody, any co untry, 
they  may not like Jews, but th Œ they  Œ 
nobody would think about it,
 that there may be an 
[indecipherable]
 arrangement of 
Œ of massacre of Jews. So Œ

ounds like he gave you the idea that saved 
you, if we go fu rther in your story. 
A: Maybe. Maybe.

Q: Thank you.

Q: Thank you. 
A: That™s all right. 
Q: You did it, all right. So, we™re in the ghetto. Then Œ 

A: We mo ved into th e ghetto end of ™42, 
and the main problem there was starvation, 
the Œ we didn™t have en ough to  eat. 
Q: How did your pare
nts get food for you? 
A: They didn™t. They  Œ 
Q: They had no way, huh? 
A: Yeah. They cannot Œ I don™t have, we 
never forget, you know
, just the two or 
three evenings before a Œ the end of the 
ghetto, that Œ from dinner, we had one egg. 
And we were sitting, all four of us, and 
my father or my mo
ther said look, we 
discussed it 
[indecipherable]
 betw een us, and we could di
vide this egg into  four. 
Or another way, one will receive the whole 
egg, and then when 
we get another one, 
the second one, third one and so
 on. So we decided we go fo
r one, so that he can be 
stronger, and Œ and th ey said, we decided 
you™ll be the one. And they gave me the 
egg. You know, I was eating it 
[indecipherable]
 and you know, it looked to me like 
the 
delicatess
(ph) of the wo rld. And in th e middle 
of eating this, I raised my head, I

have seen th e three people, both my  parents, and 
Dina,
 my  sister looking at me with 
hungry ey es. You know, I re
member their eyes, you know, 
like it will be yesterday. 
Maybe this explains mo re than anything el
se, the starvation which we went through 
at that time . There was certainly not enough 
bread, not enough anything, ca Œ on the 
bread, you know. Not even
 all these ersatz, th e Œ what Œ 
what Œ that came instead of 
coffee, like ersatz coffee and er
satz tea and things like this. 
Q: Replacement, replacement, rep lacement. 

A: Yes. But even that Œ 
this we couldn™t get.  
Q: In all this time, do you remember having
 any contact with either the Germans, or 
any of the Poles, or the sold
iers? I mean, did these Œ did 
any of these outsiders come 
into your world? No. 
A: No, not at all. 

Q: Not at Œ 

A: It couldn™t be. It couldn™t Œ it couldn™
t happen, it couldn™t be. The-They  wou Œ th 
Œ our way of knowing things was throug
h my mother. We used to go to the 
Judenrat
, which was in the second to wn , just nearby, and to  sit with them. The 
head of the 
Judenrat
 was also a me Œ
 
a 
Merin. 
Probably a Œ I don™t know even , he 
was certainly not a relative of Œ a near relative, but maybe he was a distant relative, 

this could well be. And she was meeting hi
m, and he was telling her about wh at™s

going on. Toward s the end of Ju
ly ™43, she came back ho
me and she said, they am 
going to  cancel this ghetto. And, you kn
ow, my father said, how do you know? 
What happened? Sh e say, I have seen today that the Gestapo took all the memb ers 
of the 
Judenrat
 somewhere away, and th
ey Œ they didn™t come 
back. This must me 
Œ mean that they send them to 
Auschwitz
. We already knew at that time about 
Auschwitz
. Ha Œ 
Q: And so th ey started to believe 
the man who had come to your home? 
A: Yes, yes, at that time they al
ready believed what™s going on there. 
Q: And so, it™s about a year™s difference, isn™t it? 
A: Yes, this was about Œ  
Q: Didn™t you say he came at 1942? 
A: Yes. And this was July ™43, when they 
Œ July ™43 already, it wa Œ it became clear 

what™s going on. Still tried to make normal life. I know Œ I remember my father, 

when  we moved into  the ghe
tto, my father tried to bu
ild a fence around the small 
piece of land which belonged to this Œ to
 the room which we 
had, because no Jew 
was allowed more than one room. So he
 built this, and I reme mb er somebody 
coming over and said, are you crazy? They 
are going to kill off all of us. Why do 
you do it? Well, it was quite clear. When my
 mother said it, she said, we cannot

stay here. They will cancel 
this ghetto. And they Œ they
 decided to leave the ghetto, 
and try to escape into the woods. 
Q: Did she know what was happeni
ng with her family
 from the village? 
A: No. 

Q: She had Œ 

A: At that time, no. 

Q: No. 
A: There was no connection with the village
, there was no way to know. But, we 
decided to  leave, and we decided to leav
e on a Sunday where 
they Œ there™s less 
guards, fewer guards around the ghetto. So we
 decided to  Œ to leave on the first of 
August, Sunday, in the mo rning. 
Q: 1943. 

A: 1943. 

Q: Just before your 10
th
 birthday. 
A: Before, yes. In the evening of the 31
st
 of July, you know, I remember how I went 
to sleep and I put on my  clothes and I pu
t them neatly on the chair, I thought, to 
have tomo rrow wh en  we leave 
[indeciphera ble]
 wh at I decided to take, and they 
were put down here. In the middle of 
the night, the Germans came. This wen Œ 
shouting of the street s,  
the Germans are coming, th
e Germans are coming. And

Judenrein. Judenrein
, they are taking ever
ybody. It™s not that they select people, 
some to come and some not, they are taking
 everybody. The same Œ so we be Œ we 
had no choice. Now, there were Œ it was im
possible, because they
 put heavy guards 
around th e ghetto. It was impossible to leav
e. We went down into what we called 
the bunker. The bunker, many 
families arranged some way 
out, to escape, because, 
if it was not the 
Judenrein
 and they were coming and taking, then th ey took 
anybody whom they found
. They Œ they didn™t
 look too much for it, but yes. So we 
went down into the bunker, and th e bunker
 was a very good one. You had to go 
through a Œ through a cupboard like this, 
to move a draw er, and then to open  
another door like this, and went to go dow
n over a ladder, and into the bunker. Very 
difficult, nobody could really Œ when 
you open the cupboard, you wouldn™t see 
anything. So  we went down . This was pr
epared for exactly su
ch a case. It was 
prepared for four people. In a short time 
we found ourselves w
ith 16 other people, 
and you couldn™t say anything, I mean, all 
o u r family came, cause they knew that 
our bunker is the best. We 
stayed there for three days, probably th e worst three days 
of my life. It was terrible. It was A
ugust, very hot, small place. It was Œ 

Q: No toilet. 
A: Of course no toilet, but there was no wate
r in th-there. We didn™t think about it. 
There was no water. There was no place to 
sit for everybody, y
ou know? My father,

remember, was sitting on the ladder, which was taking down. The thirst was 
terrible. On the third day they unders
tood how it™s done. They
 came over there and 
they couldn™t find the entrance 
into this, so they went do
wn in to the basement and 
started to break the wall. Soldiers came a
nd start to break the wall. When they did 
it, and they opened th e hole, there were my
 cousin, older than me by three or four 
years shouted we Œ we give in, we don™t 
Œ we give up and we are Œ we are going 
out. So the soldier shouted, all right, how 
do we get in here? So he told him where 
to open it. Started to go ou
t, and they took all of us to the place where we were 
waiting for the train to 
Auschwitz
. It was terrible three days
, really, it™s not only Œ I 
tried once to go out, and it was quiet, to 
find water. And they couldn™t, there was no 
water anywhere, they closed the water, 
the Germans. So there was no water 
anywhere. I looked 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So you had gone out of
 the bunker into  your old ap art Œ into your old room? 
A: Yes, yes.  

Q: And did you rememb er seeing an
ything, or hearing anything Œ 
A: It was a ground floor, I Œ I Œ I heard a 
cart on th e street, so I looked out, and I 
looked behind it. It was a cart full of dead 
bodies. I remember the picture of it, was 
terrible.  
Q: Was this the first time that you saw dead bodies? 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
46
A: Dead, yes, yes. There were so many of
 them, this I remember. Many, one on the 
other, on the other. But it were terrible thr
ee days. And then they were taken to the 
station, to the train station. It was Œ it was not the regular train station, it was a 
station which was made up for Jews, to 
take up th e Jews. And we were waiting 
there surrounded by the German soldiers. 
And there my  mo ther told me, you mu st 
run away, must run away. So I 
said, okay. I took my sister
 with me, and I broke out. 
There was a fence with Œ a wooden fence, 
so I could break up one place, and being 
a slim boy, could easily get thro ugh, and my  
sister was slim as I was. And we went 
through it. After a few minutes, when we were there hiding on the other side of the 
fence, I found out that we ar
e in a German military camp . 
Q: Oh, God. 
A: And of course it took another 10 minute
s or so, and the soldiers found us. Bu t 
luckily, you know, both of us l
ooked symp athetic, I would say. 
Q: You™re kids, you™re kids. 
A: Kids, and the soldiers didn™t beat us or
 Œ as they would do otherw ise, but they 
took us back, and they send 
us in. When I came over ther
e I wanted to speak with 
my mother, but she said. when
 I was, not yet at her, she said, don™t come to me, 
don™t come to me, because us there will be, 
when they see that we are your parents, 
after you tried to run aw ay. A second time,
 when  we were Œ it was close and the Œ

the train was already coming in, I thought, th
at™s the last chance 
that we have, and I 
tried it another time. A nd th-this time we 
succeeded. We went 
by, not far from the 
German watchman who was there. He Œ he
 was looking over the street on the other 
side. He didn™t look anybody would walk ne
arby him, cause he wouldn™t think that 
any Jew would do it. And th is was just 
off the edge, where all the Poles were 
coming through. So, the only
 thing I felt was Œ my  thought was only, how does it 
feel when th e bullet would struck you Œ st
rike you. And so  we Œ we could get out 
from there. 
Q: And
 Dina
 was not crying, she was not Œ 
A: No, no, no. No, no. 
Q: She Œ she trusted big brother. 
A: Yes. She n Œ she never. But once when I 
was talking about it with the scouts, and 

then they  asked a lot of questions; one of 
them was, how did you go out your sister, 
how mu ch did you quarrel, how
 mu ch did you fight with 
her and so  on? And I said, 
never. We never quarreled. We never was fi
ghting. Not in that time, and not after 
this. And that™s true. 

Q: Can I ask Œ can I ask you too, how 
did your relation to your father change? 
Because it sounds wi Œ the last time we le
ft it is before the 
war, and he wants one

thing for you and you want another. But certa
inly with the way th
ings took, that was 
out of Œ that Œ that issue went off the table. 
A: How right you are. How right you are,
 you know. That™s exactly  so. You know, 
for the first time in Œ in my
 life, my young life, I felt 
so rrow about my father, cause 
I felt how much he suffers. And for the first 
time in my life I came to him, I said, 
look, if you want to teach me relig ious
 stuff, I want you. Just say when, I am 
coming and learn it. First time. Ca
use he knew  that I don™t like. 
Q: And how did he react to that? 

A: He was Œ I think he was happy that he Œ he gave me lessons.  

Q: Did you feel closer to him, besides 
having symp athy and seeing his sorrow, did Œ 
did you feel like he was 
closer to you, too? 

A: Yes, I think so. I think so . For the firs
t time that he really Œ I felt that he 

understands me better. But I certainly 
did understand him. I knew that he is 
suffering this. So we went Œ we left this pl
ace, and the two of us went to town . And 
I knew ab out the Po lish wo man who was the 
maid in my aunt™s place before the 

war. 

Q: Had you met her? 
A: Y Œ I knew her well.  
Q: You knew her well, okay. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

A: Very well, even. She 
came from a village in 
Poland
, and she was the only Po lish 
woman whom I really knew. 
I didn™t know anybody else. I went to her. And we 
stayed there for one and a half years. 
Q: Wow. 
A: We were hiding in a place what Œ what  Œ there was a Œ it was one room when she 

lived wh ere she lived, but there was a connec
tion to a small room after this. We put 

a cupboard between the two,
 so anybody who came in has seen only one room, and 
we were in the second room. Second r
oom was about this size, may b e a little 
smaller. 

Q: So, was this the last 
time you saw your parents? 
A: Yes, it was the last time. 
[phone ringing] 
Q: Yeah. So  this was the last time  you saw your parents. 

A: Yes, this was the last time I™ve seen my
 parents. I said the Œ th is Polish woman, 
when  Œ she was not at Œ at home, she was working in a German factory for 
ammunition. Sh e was preparing th e sandwi
ches for the worker
s, the bread wa Œ 
sandwiches were bread and jam, you know, a
nd th ey Œ mu ch di Œ th at was her job. 
She was working there and when she cameb ack home, she found us waiting for her 

out in th e street. She was Œ I Œ I am not sure that she was very happy about it. I am 
certain that she was not. But sh
e was shocked by th  Œ us. And Œ

Q: How did she behave? 
A:

should. Sh -S he said to us, after a few da
ys, look, she said, if you had come with 
your parents, I would never take you in
. This would be impossible. But you came 
alone, you two, you will stay with me here
. And sh e was frightened  all the time, you 
know. 

Q: Well, did she have a fami ly
, or was she living by herself? 
A: She was single, but her family was in 
the village. The family certainly did not 
support her. One day when  I asked her wh at
 would your fami ly do if they wo uld 

know that you keep Jews? So
 she said they would go to th e Gestapo. They  would 
go, she would Œ she lived
 after the war in a Œ
 Italy

ear she was sending it several ti mes. A nd 
she say Œ sh-she was the one wh o taught me
 they would go and Œ and they™ll report 
me to police, to the Gestapo. 

Q: Did she tell you while you were livi
ng with  her, or many years later? 
A: At least twice. She was at that time 
telling me Œ no, I asked her, during th e time 
was there, she said it. I th
ought maybe she™s not right. 
We were lucky because we 
didn't  have, you know, she couldn™t Œ she 
had to pay on the black market to get 
some food for us. And luckily 
I knew wh ere my  parents Œ they to ld me before I left, 
they said, look, we 
put some money in this place. The money Œ and I knew where it 
is, and I told her. And said, I will never fi
nd it. You know, the way I explained to 
her. So we decided my sister would go. Sh
e doesn™t look Jewish at all, and she Œ 
they will take Œ she Œ so sh

How did you interact? How much 
of the outside did you see? 
A: Not at all. We Œ we couldn™t.

A: Yes. There was no way Œ we
 couldn™t talk loud in any ways, except Œ you know, 
and Œ and we couldn™t make 
any noise. And we played . It was a game, an imaginary 
world in which the two of us lived. We™re 
playing, all imagination. I remember she 

Œ one day she wanted  to make a present to
 us, and she brought over paper figures 
for us to play, just to show

 of January  1945, he woke me up at six o™clock in the mo rning, 
and he says, rise quickly. The Germans f
ound us. And I looked  through the window 
and I have seen a lot of soldiers there. A
nd it was clear that they found us, and that™s 
the end of it. And su ddenly we see a 
Jeep
 passing by with a red flag, with the red 
army. So this was not the Œ these were not
 Germans, but Russians, and for the first

time. So we left a few days later, this place. Oh, and they  found another apartment 
for us. We stayed with 
Aniela
(ph). 
Q: Can I ask this? In her one room, was 
she Œ did she have like a separate little 
house, or did she have one room Œ 
A: No, no. 

Q: Œ within an apartment building? 

A: No, it was an apartment 
building with maybe six, seven apartments there. At 
least six, seven, maybe 10, even . 

Q: Was it a courtyard as well, like you had? 

A: No. 
Q: No. 
A: No. it was a entrance from the street. What 
my  cousin did, he closed the entrance 
to the building. Was all the time k ept lo
cked . Nobody was there. And he Œ he 
destroyed all the other apartments so th
at nobody would move in. So  there was 
anything wh ich could 
be broken, he broke. 
Q: So, in other words, 
Aniela
(ph) lived in this apartm
ent build ing by herself, with 
you. 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: With the three of you.

A: Yes, until one family moved in, in spite
 of the ruined hous
e, you know. And so 
we had to take care much more about it. Fo
r instance, in the wint
er of 1944, it was a 
bitter winter, but one day when they Œ sh
e came back from work, the neighbors say 
to her, look, what™s going on there? There 
was the chimney, there was steam from 
your chimney. And so she said, I left it, 
my  mistake. Nobody would keep it, because 
there was not enough Œ 
Q: Fuel for everything. 
A: Œ fuel to run it. So nobody would le
ave it when you are not at home. But from 
that time w e couldn™t heat the room in
 the bitter winter, you know, because it 
couldn™t Œ it would happen ag
ain, they would know that 
something fishy is going on 
there 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Did you interact with y
our cousin much, when she 
was not there? I mean, w ere 
you then  mo re togeth er? 

A: Yes, yes, I was, you know, sometimes 
when Œ he told me about the world. I 
didn™t know anything about it. 

Q: About the war? 

A: About the world. 
Q: Oh, th e world.

Q: Can I ask an indiscreet question? Were
 they Œ was she a young lady who Œ were

A: Yes, yes, she was Œ they were together, yeah. 

Q: Did he come to her afte
r she found Œ af
ter you had Œ 
A: He came probably a short time before 
we came, because he was caught by the 

Gestapo and accused of trading the points, 
you know, which were given for Œ for Œ 
for food. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And he was put, as they did it for a Œ be
fo re a court, which looked like any other 
court, except that they had only one senten
ce, this was the death sentence, and that™s 
what he received, the death sentence for 
this. But a day later he ran away, he 
succeeded to flee fro
m the prison, and he came to 
Aniela
(ph), stayed there with her. 
And that™s Œ after the war, this was the

the Œ once the war was over. I was still Œ I di
dn't learn in school 
at any time. And I 
was really lucky, because two or three mont
hs later, in Œ in April, actually two 
months later, in April 1945, my aunt came from
 Russia. 
She survived in
 Russia, 
she was one of the sist ers of my f ather. 
Q: Had she left for
 Russia
 Œ 
A: In 1939 in August, just before th
e war. She said, I will not stay here. 
Q: Interesting, interesting. 
A: I™ll not stay here waiting for the German
s. So that she decided to  leave and run 
away.  
Q: Did sh Œ how Œ I had a couple of questio
ns here. Did she have stories of how she 
had been treated, and what had ha
ppened to  her when  she was in 
Russia
?
 
A: Yes, she was Œ she succ
eeded to  get thro ugh to  
Lv ov
. You know
 Lvov
 is today 
th Œ one of the three cities of
 Ukraine
. And she was there, settled there and Œ but 
she lived in 
Lvov
 with thousands,
 thousands of refugees who came over there, and 
life was not good. She was a rich woman.
 She was otherwise not like the other 
brothers and sisters. And in  
Lv ov
, the rumors came in 19
40 th at it™s not bad with 
the Germans. They didn™t 
know anything about killing 
Jews. And they said, well, 
they are not very good, the Germans, but it™s not that it™s impossible to live with 

them. In Œ in April 1940, th
e Russians announced that wh
oever wants to go back to 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
59
the German side can do it, and they will he
lp, they will make a train which will take 
them to the German side. 
She decided to go back, like 
another one or 2,000 people 
who came to the train. On a certain day they  came to the train, and when  they ™re 
sitting in the tain Œ train, the Russians cl
osed the doors, and they said, you are 
enemy of the people, you wa
nt to go back to the Germ
ans. You are all going to 
Siberia. 
Q: And this is during the 
Mo lovov-Ribb entrop Pact, 
when they™re friends? 
A: This was after this. 
Q: Oh, this was after th is? 

A: Yeah, the 
Ribbentro p-Molo tov Pact 
was til the war, til the Œ til bast --
 
Barb arossa
, til the attack of the Germans. 
Q: Til 1941. 

A: Til 1941. Til the 22
nd
 of June 1941. 
Q: Oh, and I thought you said it was in
 1940 th at she wanted to go back. 
A: Yes, 1940. 

Q: So it™s Œ so it™s while they™re still friends? 

A: Yes. 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
 was in 1939. 
Q: Correct. 

A: This was in 1940. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

Q: So th at™s why I™m saying, isn™t it unusual Œ 
A: There were still friends. 

Q: Œ that while they™re still 
friends, they™re called enemie
s of the people, and taken 
to 
Siberia
? 
A: Don™t worry, that™s what th
ey said, that™s what
 they did. They took all of them to 
Siberia, 
all these who decided, according to 
th eir saying, and it really seemed 
unlikely that they will do anything, because th
ey were friends. They
 took them all to 
Siberia.
 And many, many of them survived, becau
se of this. But wh
at she did, she 
decided we™re not going to
 Siberia
. On  th e way  
[indecipherable]
 and su cceeded to 
flee from that train. They were stopping 
th e train from time to time, once in a 
couple of days, and so Œ to 
supply, to buy some products, 
and that™s what they  did. 
And they went down and got back. And th
ey li Œ stayed there, until in ™41 the 
Germans came in. When the Germans came 
in, her husband was killed on the same 
thing. They went from house to house lo
oking for communists and Jews and to ok 
them, and all the men were shot in the same
 thing. She told me
 how after a couple 
of days, she went to the Gestapo and to ld  them look, my husband is in prison. 

Would you Œ I brought 
him a sweater because it™s cold
. And the German looked at 
it, gave it back to her. He 
doesn™t need it. So she unde
rstood. She stayed with her 
son, they  changed th  Œ on false papers. Got an 
I.D.
 of a Polish woman and that™s

what Œ what Œ what they  did to surv ive. 
When she came b ack 
in April ™45 Œ no, it 
was the first time, she said
, I will take care of, we will not staying here with 
Aniela
(ph) or with 
Wolfe.
 You will come with me. She had the son, the son 
survived  with her and she really took very
 good care of Œ of me and in fact, she 
never let me feel that I am not her son, or 
Dina
 is not her daughter.  
Q: I was going to ask, did she take 
Dina
, too? Yes. 
A: She Œ yes. We™re all Œ we were thre
e of us there like brothers and sister. 
Q: And you stayed in
 Bendzin
, you moved to 
Israel
? 
A: No, she moved to  another town  there, 
Hoczew,
 and this was the place where she 
lived before the war, not 
far from there, a mo re Ge
rman town than ours,
 Bendzin
. 
And we stayed there. In 1940 
Œ in 1946, the chief rabbi of 
Israel, Yitzhak Herzog
, 
came to 
Poland,
 and he had an agreement with 
the Polish government that he can 
take children up to the age 
of 14, if they are orphans
, they will go with him to
 
Israel, Palestine 
at th at time. And so we joined this
 train. Went with him, but it was 
stuck in 
Prague
, and then we went to 
Austria
, where we had that distant relative of 
the new husband of my  aunt. And they stay
ed Œ w-we stayed th
ere for some time, 
decided to  go back to  
Poland
 because you couldn™t mo ve on. And it was a camp of 
the 
DPs
 in
 Linz.
 The
 DP 
camps were run by the Americans, and by th e 
Joint. 
So 
there were Jewish people of the 
Joint
 there wh-who were rea
lly helping us a lot. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

And the Americans, they were
 running th e places. And it was
 Bindermichl
, and the 
other place in
 Linz 
was 
Wegsheid.
 Just these days I see in the newspaper a picture 
of
 Wegsheid, 
which was not far from there. So, 
we Œ we stayed there and came 
back to 
[indecipherable].
 When Œ already in 1945, we
 understood that our parents 
will not come back. You know, at the be
ginning, the first fe
w months, e-every Œ 
everybody who knocking on th
e door, maybe they are comi
ng back, or one of them 
is coming back. But towards April or Ma
y, it was clear that nobody would co me 
back. In fact, I tried to find out wh
at happened with th em. I went to 
Auschwitz
, 
cause that time I was 1 1 , I went to 
Auschwitz
 with my cousin, tr
ied to look there 
over this, the only thing I could find is in 
Œ in  the gas ch ambers 
that was written the 
kema r
(ph) Œ revenge, which they ha
ve written with their blood.  
Q: Were there people, were there officials in 
Auschwitz
? Was there anybody 
manning Œ I mean, I don™t mean Germans, 
I mean, had anyone else come in, was 
the place empty, was it deserted? 
A: It was deserted in that time. T h e-Th
ey opened it as a mu
seum much later Œ 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
A: But at that time it w as just deserted. 
You could come in, you could go in, look 
where Œ whatever you want, at 
wherever you want, and that™s
 Œ that™s what we did.

Q: And no one was Œ yeah, an
d no one was there keepin
g Œ you know, looking at 
the Œ whatever records they mi
ght have kept to say, okay
, let™s see, maybe you™re Œ 
there was nobody there? 
A: I Œ I wouldn™t know it. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I wouldn™t know it. 

Q: You were 11 years old, also. 
A: Yes, I wouldn™t know it. The Ru ssi
ans came in on the same  day, on the 27
th
 of 
January ™4 5,th
ey came into 
Auschwit z
 Œ 
Q: 
Auschwitz
. 
A: Œ the same day they came into our town. 
Q: How did they behave? Did you have an
y interaction with the Russian soldiers? 
A: Not too much. 

Q: Not too much. 
A: Not too much. My cousin left 
immediately, he had a Œ a red Œ 
Q: Armband? 
A: Œ 
ba ndero l a
(ph)
 Œ 
armb and, like this. And he went down . And I™ve seen the 
soldiers from the window, I™ve 
seen soldiers stopping him 
and talking with him, and 
shouting at him. And then so
mebody ordering him to take
 it off, so he took it off. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
64
No, there was not mu ch communication w
ith the Russians. 
The Russians left 
Auschwitz
 also, very quickly. 
Q: So they were on to 
Berlin
? 
A: Yes, they went on. This was the south, I believe, to 
Berlin,
 where 
Zh u k o v
 and 
his army was more to the north.  
Q: That™s right, that™s right. 

A: This was a southern army  that moved 
out. The Po les didn™t behave too well after 
the war, you know. I remember first time that
 I really went out, to the square of the 
city center, pole Œ position where a man st
ood at one of the windows and gave a 
speech about new
 Poland
, and the communist 
Poland
. They called it the socialist 
party, and the socialist 
Pola nd . 
And they said that the Russi
an promised that if they 
will behave really like true communists, 
they will change the 
name of the party 
from the socialist part of 
Poland
 to  the communist party of 
Poland
. Very like today 
that they say that. And I was standing 
there listening to him, together with 
thousands of Po les, when the woman said
 to me, you are Jewish? I said yes. She 
said, how do you survive? So
 I told her, a Polish woma
n helped us. She said oh 
God, she said, oh God. And a boy mu ch ol
der than I was, you know, heard it from 
[indecipherable]
 wh at Jew, you are a Jew? Ga Œ gave
 me a fist in my  head, in my  
face. And you know, to me, then I understo
od that they don™t 
like us too much. I

couldn™t find a Œ a barber to Œ to make 
my  head , wh ich looked terrible, of course, 
after all these years. N o body wanted to ta
ke me, when he understood that I am 
Jewish, yes. 
Q: That™s an awful lot for an 
11 year old to have to look 
at, to deal with Œ 12 year 
old. 
A: Yes, yeah. It was not nice. You know, 
at that time it w as really Œ later on Œ I 
went to 
Poland 
again. I left in 1949 for 
Israel, 
when Œ when it wa
s allowed, when 
the Polish govern ment allowed 
the people to go out to 
Israel
, only to
 Israel. 
But 
many years later I™ve been in 
Poland
, just like eight or 10 years ago. So now they 

accepted me, now in a different way, beca
use I came, they knew at the time a 
professor of ophthalmology and I immediat
ely also invited a Po
lish ophthalmologist 

to come to 
Israel
 and I will help him for a couple of
 weeks to see the country, but 
maybe to learn about ophthalmology in  
Israel. 
And they were very happy about it. 
Made a dinner for me and so this was very nice. And I tried to think all the time, is 
there still anti-Semitism in 
Poland
? And you know what? It changed comp letely. It 
became ridiculous. It™s not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it™s an anti-Semitism 

of Œ of a ridiculous sort. You could only 
laugh at it, you know? I rememb er my  Œ a 
Œ a cousin  of mine in
 Israel
 went to the town, to
 Bendzin
, and he took pictures, 
video pictures, he had a Œ a team which 
[indecipherable]
 for him. And then he 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

66
asked people, he went to the school. 
The school exists, but it™s not called
 
Furstenberg
. 
Q: What happened to
 Furstenberg
? 
A: 
Fursten
(ph) was killed by th e Germans, like
 anybody else. I t was Œ you know, 
they didn™t kill people becau
se they were poor or rich
, they killed people because 
they were Jewish. He was Jewish, that 
was enough. He spoke at the school. They 
asked him to speak, wh ich Œ so  he spoke with
 them, and si Œ before I start my  talk, 
who knows what was the name of the scho
ol before the war? Not one of them 
knew. Said, did you hear the name  of 
Furstenberg
? No t one of them knew. So  he 
told them the history of the school and abou
t. Then  he went into a place that looked 
very similar to our house. So
 it™s three build ings around a large courtyard. It was in 
another part of the city. I knew that th
ere were two places like this. Ours was 
destroyed later, cause they pu
t the Œ a road there. They 
built a road there. And the 
other place, he went there. 
And in both places there were
 Jewish Œ there only Jewish 
people living. And he went around, first in
 the main street of the city and asked 
people, remember the Jews who lived here? 
Nobody know. He went
 into this house, 
where only Jews lived
, in all of the three buildings. And when  they  came out and 
they were standing around 
him, and he says to them, 
remember th e Jews who lived 
here? Not one. You look at the people, he
 took pictures. Old people that certainly 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
67
lived there, you know, in
 the second World War. Nobo
dy rememb ers. Then a dog 
passed by, and he looks at the dog, and th
e wo man sticks out her head from one of 
the windows and calls, 
Aaro n, Aaron
. So he says to her, that™s the name of the 
dog? Sh e says yes. Why
 Aaron
? So she says, 
Aaron,
 that™s so that we rememb er 
the Jews who lived here. This was the fi
rst time that he 
found somebody who 
reme mb ered the Jews, you know
, through the dog. This is 
ridiculous. That™s not the 
same anti-S emitism that frightened my pare
nts and the Jews before the war, or even 
after the war, in the first years after the 
war. It Œ it was just same like before the 
war, in 
Kielce
, the pogrom in
 Kielce
 where more than 40 Je
ws were killed in 1946. 
Q: How do you explain th
at? How do you explain it? 
A: You know, I™m not sure that I tried to 
think even about it. It certainly changed, 
there™s no Œ today, it stopped at Œ it™s so
mething on a personal level, it™s not Œ 
certainly not that 
[indecipherable]
 of a country. 

Q: Did you feel when you were Œ when  you
 were meeting with people, and they  had 
this dinner, that there was a lack of  sincerity? That there was a lack of 

understanding, of genuineness,
 that somehow or other you couldn™t trust what it was 
that you were seeing? 
A: That they could not trust? 
Q: No, th at you could not. 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
68
A: Well, may Œ may well be like this, yes. 
That Œ that I couldn™t trust everything 
that was said to me. You know, after I invited the ophthalmologist, I got maybe 
three or four calls from the mayors of th
e town ship s of Œ which belonged to this 
area, and they were all at the dinner, five mayors, cause these were the places where 

Jews Œ Jewish people lived around, including 
Sztemaszitsa
(ph), the Œ the village of 
my mother. And after I left, and I 
left the invitation for one of the 
[indecipherable]
 
from 
Dombrowa,
 one of the fi Œ five town ships.
 I got later maybe three or four 
calls from the mayors. Look, maybe you take
 them for three weeks instead of two 
weeks. And another one calls me, maybe 
you know, I have somebody else who may 

be better, maybe we™ll take two ones, you know. 
[indecipherable]
 the Poles, one 
mu st understand it. I don™t know if you read the book, it was 
Michener
, was 
[indecipherable] Poland. 
Q: No, but I heard of
 it, I know of it. 
A: You know, when  you read 
it, you Œ you read the history of a tragedy. The Po les 
suffered always, from the beginning. The Je
ws suffered more, but it was a trag edy 
for the Poles, what was going on there. Th
e Swedes attacked them, I think it was the 
17
th
 century, 17
th
 or 18
th
, I believe 17
th
 century, and massacred the Poles. You know, 
they killed thousands,
 thousands of Poles. And if it 
wasn™t the Swedes, then it was 
the Russians or the Germans, the Prussi
ans, you know, all of the time. They 

 
Interview with SaulMerin 
 
 
April 19, 2009 
 

 
 
69
suffered a lot. And on the Œ on the persona
l level, they suffered from the system, it 
was a feudal system. Why are there so many Po
lish jokes, the Polack jokes in Œ in Œ 
in the 
United States
, you know, because they  came when the 
[indecipherable]
 was 
Œ was annihilated at the beginning of the 20
th
 century, after the second World War, 
the end of the second World War, suddenl
y th ey could trave Œ they  could g Œ and 
many of them traveled  to the 
United States
, they had relatives here or so Œ they 
came over here, mo st of them settled in 
Chica go
, and it™s not only th ey didn™t know 
English, cause Ukraines also didn™t kn
ow English wh en they came over, and Œ 

Q: You™re talking probably 
the first World War, yes? 
A: Yes, first war. 
Q: First World War, mm-hm.  
A: Did I say second? No, first World War. 
And the Ukraines when they came over, 
they also didn™t know English. They di
dn't know English, but they  didn™t know 
anything, they were uneducated. They  didn™
t know to read and to write, most of 
them. It Œ and Œ because in the feudal sy
stem they couldn™t go 
to school without 
permission to go to school wa
s not given by the noblemen. 
[indecipherable]
 wan t  
the educated people here, I need
 workers here. And so, they 
[indecipherable]
 
people like this, I think, always start tryi
ng to find the scapegoa
t. The scapegoat for 
that Œ you know, it was a good feeling that 
there is somebody who is inferior to 

 
Interview with SaulMerin

70
them. And for this they have 
to show that the Jews are in
ferior. And if they can kill 
the Jews, or you know, curse them or show 
their inferiority, then
 it gives them the 
superiority complex. I think 
that™s the main reason for 
[indecipherable]
 anti-
Semitism. That™s it. I Œ 
Q: Thank you. 

A: Œ I have five minutes more? No. 

Q: You have five minutes mo
re, you have five minutes 
more. You™ve more minutes, 
if you want. 

A: You know, if I divide my  history, my  
story into four periods, the fourth  period 
was different. That™s th Œ that™s the time when I came to 
Israel
, and for the first 
time in my life I felt like 
equal with equals. There was no problem any mo re. I 
knew that when I go to school, I will not 
be chased up like in
 the Polish school 
where I remember very well. In mathematic
s, I™m very good in mathematics. I knew 
it, there was no doubt about it. But 
always I was given a very low Œ  
Q: Grade. 

A: Œ grad e. And I couldn™t un
derstand it in that Œ in the last class w h en I was, I 
knew that I can get a grade which will not 
be enough to pass into
 the next class. 
Q: So you™re talking postwar,

Q: Yes.  
A: And I knew also that the teacher is
 anti-S emitic. A young woman, anti-Semitic. 
One day she came, and she said, whoever will Œ I™m giving here some exercises to 
do. Whoever will finish it the first will get a 
very good grade. A 
grade of very good. 
And she was Œ I knew, that™s mine. I fille
d it o u t for it, I came much before the 
second one, to give it to her. And she didn™t
 take it, she was sitting there, she didn™t 
take it, she waited. Then  another boy came 
after me, and she took
 his. I said, I was 
the first. N o , no, he was 
the first. What can I do? 
Q: Of course not. 

A: And this happen Œ on the same day 
she gave another ex ercise and another 
exercise, and in all of them I was the fi
rst one of the wh ole class, by far, you know. 
And then  she had no choice, so she gave 
me good, but not very
 good. Sh e couldn™t 
Œ you know, all this changed, of course.
 
In 
Israel 
I was even. And maybe that™s the 
best. I went to school of medicine, b
ecame a doctor, became an ophthalmologist, 
professor of ophthalmology, so  I coul
d devote a lot to teaching. I became a 
professor also here at the University of
 Illinois
, where from time to time I have 
been there and I wo
rk there. And in 
[indecipherable]
 I did many things for 
humanity, I would say, you know. Like I went to 
Africa
 to work two years, with my 
family. My wife and the two kids, when they Œ 
Za k
, my  son, who work s here in

[indecipherable]
 he was, at that time, five years 
old. And the Œ I went to wo rk fo r 
two years. 
Q: In what country? 
A: In
 Ma lawi.  
Q: In
 Ma lawi
.  
A: 
Mala wi
 is southeast. And then I ca
me back maybe 10 times to 
Africa
, each time 
for periods of between three months to one month. And I liked it. It™s only mi Œ 

maybe five years ago when  I went back to
 Rwa nda  
to operate, to operate people. 
And so there are, at least, 2,000 Africa
ns who are walking around, who are walking 
around th ere seeing, just because I ope
rated them, you know? So  it gives you a 
good feeling. Maybe that™s the Œ the reve
nge on the Nazis Œ Nazi
s. They not only 
didn™t succeed to kill you, but also th
ey couldn™t prevent me, you know, doing 
things for Œ 
Q: Others. 
A: Œ humanity. 
Q: Yes. They didn™t ta
ke away your humanity. 
A: Yes. Didn™t stop me from doing it. I™m in 
the last nine years. I am in Œ a doctor, a 
specialist in 
Saint John 
Eye Hospital, which is an eye hospital in eastern
 
Jerusalem
 that serves the Ar
ab population of the 
West Bank 
and
 Gaza. 
Mainly it

serves the Arab population of 
Jerusalem
, but also of all the 
complicated cases are 
sent over to me. So I see there a 
lot of complicated cases from the 
West Bank
 and 
from
 Gaza
 as well. And I continue with this, I like it, an d Œ 
Q: Do you Œ do you have mo re interacti
on beyond Œ beyond being a doctor to  them? 
Is there any way of Œ of Œ I don™t even
 know how to put th
e question. Do your 
Palestinian patients get to know you, do 
you get to know them in some ways? 
A: Well, they know me and they like me
, I™ve no doubt about it. You cannot get 
through a certain level. A couple Œ also 
because of different 
attitude and different 
way of thinking, you know? It was maybe th
ree or four months ago, where I gave 
an injection into the eye of 
an Arab patient. It™s a thing which I do a lot, I give at 
least 10 injections every week. That™s 
the modern, new way to treat some eye 
diseases. And I gave him this injection. A
nd he stands up and says, thank you, thank 
you, thank you, thank you. 
After four or five times I 
say to my  nurse, look, he 
knows two word s in English, thank and you
. So tell him to speak Arabic, and you™ll 
translate fo r me. So she said all right. 
And he say something in Arabic, and she 
translates it to me. He wants to bless you.
 And he wants to tell you Œ to wish  that 
you will have four wives. 
So, you know, this was Œ so
 it is a different way of 
thinking. 
Q: But he means well.

A: He means well, I have no doubt.  I said they liked me there.  
Q: Professor
 Merin, 
the last question I have before we end, unless there is 
something else that you would like to add to 
what we have talked ab out, is that my  
impression is that you didn™t Œ you didn't have
 a chance to really be a child, except 
in very stolen mo ments, when you were 
growing up. That you had to grow up and 
be pretty strong, very  early on. Th
at™s my impression. Is that true? 
A: That™s certainly very true. I Œ in fact
, the only thing that Œ the only thing that I 
behaved like a child is the place in Œ in Œ 
in the hiding place, there, wa Œ how I 
played with my  sister. And th
is was all about imaginary th
ings with the Œ we put up. 
So this was one and a half years that we 
played around with th
is, lucky, because I 
think that allowed me to live normally, almost, at least fro m th-the Œ the point of 

view of my soul, you know, 
about Œ wh ich was a chil Œ child
™s soul at that time, you 
know, at the Œ this was only one and a half
 years, just at the time when it was the 

worst time for me. You know, li-living wit
hout my  parents, living in  a place like 
this, in a closed place like this, and living on
 very poor food. Ju
st in that time, I 
think I felt a child at that time. Just
 playing around with all this, and Œ 
Q: In Œ in these circumstances Œ

A: Œ I think this was lucky, yes, this wa
s lucky. I think it happ
en ed  also  w ith  th e 
other children, who survived at that time, 
that they Œ they su
rvived  because they 
played the imaginary plays, you kn
ow? And th is kept them alive. 
Q: When  you had your own 
children, did you play w
ith them more because Œ 
because of that? Did you Œ 
did Œ was there anything fro
m this entire history that 
showed up when  your children we
re the same  ages that you Œ 
A: I never Œ I never made su
ch decisions, but yes, the tr
uth is that it was like this. 
You know, you are all the time Œ I was already a doctor. I Œ I married when I was a 
student, and I was a doctor wh en 
I had children already. And in 
Africa
 when  they 
came to Œ with me to 
Africa
, and there was not a night, unless I was busy in th e 
hospital in the evening, was not a now Œ a ni
ght that I didn™t sit down with them for 
half an hour at least, and tell them a st
ory. All imaginary st
ories, you know. But 
they still remember it day Œ to
day. My son here, well, I thin
k he told to his children 
already, some of the st ories I was 
telling them at the time. All rig h t. 
Q: Thank you, thank you. 

A: You™re welcome.
