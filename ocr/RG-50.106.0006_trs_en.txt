in Rome, yes.                  
                         
 
Q:  What kind of wo rk did yo
ur father do?                        
 
A:  My father was in the lumber business.  
He had a firm with his two brother-in-laws.   
                        
Q:  And how would you describe your family, middle cl

Q:  What kind of neig hborhood did you live in? 
 
 
 
A:  I lived in Trastevere; it's a very old sec
tion of Ro me, right in the center of Ro me and 
not far away from the ghetto wh
ere my  mo th er 's fa mily  was co min g  fro m.  
                      
 
Q:  What do you know abou
t your mother's family, a
ny information that you know 
about them?          
               
               
 
A:  Yes.  My grandfather -- Giuseppe was hi
s name -- he was very religious man, and he 
brought up all his children, you 
know, in the Jewish faith.  
And there were -- my mother 
was the youngest, and then she had five brot
hers.  And th ey lived  comfortably in this 
section of Rome.                  
                          
 
Q:  What can you tell us about your fa
ther's family?             
 
A:  My father family stayed
 -- his mother was -- her name was Maria Vizeron (ph).  She 
was Catholic.  She was in a convent in th
is region of Abruzzi, and she met my 
grandfather -- name was Ettore Funaro .  He
 was a merchant, and he -- you know, he was 
going from town  to town selling merchandise
.  And he met this young girl in the 
convent, they fell in love and she ran away
 and th ey got married, and th ey had five 
children.  And they lived in
 the small town called Aves
ano which unfortunately was 

destroyed by earthquake, so my  father lost 
all his family in this earthquake.  And also 
his grandmother was Catholic, but she had deci
ded to  bring her ch ildren, the boys in the 

Jewish faith and the girls in the Catholic fa
ith.  So my  grandfathe
r was Jewish, and my 
father also was brought up 
in the Jewish faith.   
 
Q:  Did you live right in -- within the city
 or on the outskirts?                      
                 
                
 
A:  No.  I lived in the city, not fa
r away from where the synagogu
e is in Rome, yes.           
                     
Q:  And did you live in an apartment?    
                        
 
A:  An apartment.          
                   
                   
 
Q:  Who were your neigh
bors?  Were they Jewish or nonJewish?     
 
A:  Some -- Some Jewish family, yes, yes. 
                       
 
Q:  Was it predominantly nonJewish?       
                       
 
A:  Predominantly nonJewish, yes.       
                         
 
Q:  And -- So your play mates were 
nonJewish?  The children that you pl
ayed with?              
                  
A:  Mostly, yes.                    
               
              
 
Q:  Any problems that you noticed with your 
neighbors when you were a you
ng child?                           
A:  No, no, never until, you know, th
e racial law started.       
 
Q:  But when you were little --          
                        
 
A:  Which was later on, yes.  But when I was 
little, no, no.  I don't think the Italians are 
anti-Semite, you know, as a nature. 
 
Q:  How religious was your family?       
                        
 
A:  The Italian style, you know.  We used
 to celebrate Rosh  Hashanah, Yo m Kippur, 
Pesach.  But we were not kosher, no.  In It
aly, I don't think hard ly any Jewish family 
keep kosher in the homes.

A:  Yes, yes.  I by -- bat mitzvah, yes.  An
d I had religious education.  I go in  Hebrew; 
you know, the rabbi used to co
me to our house and teach us Hebrew and prepare for the 
bat mitzvah.   
 
Q:  This is you and your sist
er?                
                 
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 

Q:  Can you describe yo
ur bat mitzvah?  Or do you rememb er?      
 
A:  Yes.  It was a lovely bat mitzvah, dre
ssed in wh ite, with curly hair and, you know, 
very pretty.  And my father 
gave a big party.  Also our 
Catholic relatives came, and it 
was a very nice celebration, yes.                
                               
 
Q:  And did you take part in the service? 
                       
 
A:  Yes.  On Saturd ay mo
rning I had to, you know, go 
to temple and for the full 
ceremony, yes.              
                    
 
Q:  What language did you speak in in 
your home?                 
 
A:  Italian.  Only Italian, yes.       
                          
 
Q:  And what was your first school that
 you went to?             
 
A:  My first school was in the neighborhood,
 in the same neighborh ood, in Trastevere.  
And then  later on wh en we moved to anothe
r house, I went to the school wh ich was 
built during the Fascist time, so it had a Fa
scist title, was called October 28 from the 
date, you know, the Fascists entered Rome. 
 And that's where, 
you know, my  Fascist 
education started because in order to enroll in
 a school, you had to  belong to the Fascist 
party.   
 
Q:  So you were in your first school 
for how lo ng?               
 
A:  Two years.  And then I continue my  elementary education in this ot
her school.               
                   
Q:  And what else did you study in  th
e other school?             
 
A:  It was a regular elementary school, yes 
 Then when I went to
 the gymnasium, then 
we started to study Latin and Greek.         
 
Q:  How old were you when  you went to th
e --                     
 
A:  Twelve years old.                
                            
 
Q:  And so that was in 1935?           
                          
 
A:  Yes.  Mm-hmm.                   
               
              
 
Q:  And up to that time, up to th e time th
at you were 12 years old, did you have any 
unpleasant experiences --                  
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  -- because you were Jewish?         
                         
 
A:  No, never.  No.  It was very well acc
epted.                  
 

Q:  Did your parents have any expe
riences that they told 
you about?                
                    
                    
A:  No, never.  Never.  As you know, I wa
s brought up in a family that was half 
Catholic, so I never noticed really.        
 
Q:  Okay.  It's 1935, and you're n o w 
in the gymnasium.           
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And any changes there, anything th at
 you --                  
 
A:  Personally, not.  Bu t my  husband, for 
in stance, he was -- you know, he had a very, 
very bad experience with one of his friend in 
school, and he decide not to go to school 
for a while,  and he ran away
, ran away to Naples without
 telling his family. And, of 
course, he was punished by his parents, and 
then they found out th
e reason so you know, 
they went to the teacher and told her about.  But that's  how it starte
d really.               
 
Q:  Did you know your husband at that poi
nt?                     
 
A:  Yes, I did.                     
               
              
 
Q:  Oh.                           
                               
 
A:  We were -- We grew up together.     
                         
 
Q:  So was he in the same school 
with you wh ere you have --      
 
A:  No.  My brother- in-law was, but
 not my husband, no.         
 
Q:  So where he had a problem was in
 a different school?         
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And you had no problem?    
                 
                 
 
A:  Yeah.                          
               
               
 
Q:  Anything th at you reme mb er from 1935 th at was of importance? 
 
A:  Well, you know, the start of the Abysinni
an -- the war against Ethiopia, and that's  
how our trouble started, the sanctions, you 
know, from England and that's -- was a very 
difficult period of our lives, yes.       
                       
 
Q:  And how aware were you of all th
is that was going on?        
 
A:  I was pretty aware because it was very important to us, yes. 
 
Q:  And your personal life changed when?  Wh
en  did you first notice the first change in 
your personal life?                   
 

A:  Well, when I had to leave my school, y
ou know.  We couldn't have any maid in the 
house.                  
                    
 
Q:  When was this?                   
                            
 
A:  That was in 1938, '39.  We had to get ri
d of our radio; marriages, you know, with the 
Catholic were forbidden and especially the 
school, you know, I had to go to a special 
school that was organized for Jewish children. 
                         
 
Q:  But in 1935, '36, '3
7 your life went on as usual?            
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  What did you do in those years aside from school?            
 
A:  Well, we used, you know, go to my fath
er's  place of birth, you know, during the 
summer, spend time with our re
latives, vacation.  And it was pretty normal.   
                          
 
Q:  It was a normal --                
              
             
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  -- life?  And you mixed with  Jews a
nd nonJews?               
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Friends?                        
               
              
 
A:  It didn't make any difference to us, 
yes.                    
 
Q:  And then came 1938, you said --      
                        
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  -- and these changes began?         
                         
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Do you reme mber what your feelings were
 in the very beginnin
g in 1938 as a young 
child?  You were only --            
 
A:  It puzzled me.  It p u zzled me.  I c
ouldn't  understandwhy, 
you know, because I 'd 
never noticed a difference before.         
 
Q:  Did you talk this over with yo
ur parents, the changes?       
 
A:  Well, yes, but we decide, you know, to
 stay in our faith; we didn't want to do 
anything of baptize or things like that.  An
d we didn't want to leave our co untry.  You 
know, we were very Italian, and we decide
 to  stay and make the best of it, never 
thinking that, you know, the wars would co
me.  But then Jews from other countries 

started to come, and they used to  go to  our s
ynagogue.  And, in fact, one day they rang 
our bell, you know, and I opened  the door, 
and I was very scared because this person 
became, you know, very nasty toward me, say 
that he needed help badly and that we 
were blind not to see the danger, that we wo uld go through th e same thing.  And so I 
told my mother and my fath
er, and they say, you know, 
we're giving our help  to the 
synagogue, and these people probably  
are exaggerating.           
 
Q:  When  was this?  Do you remember wh
en this was?               
 
A:  Well, we were stil l in our house, so
 must have been befo
re 1940, yes, mm- hmm, 
1939, '38, 1939, yes.       
                  
 
Q:  Any other experien ces in 1938 that
 you remember?             
 
A:  This I remember v ery clearly because it 
was really shocking to me.  But we knew, 
we knew -- In fact I have a cousin who wa
s from Poland; you know, many were coming.  
And one of them married one of my  cousin, fo
r instance.  And so  they used to tell us a 
story what was happening in a way.                     
 
Q:  And did you and your family 
believe what you were hearing?   
 
A:  Yes, but we thought that that would ha
ppen only in other coun
try, not in Italy.  
That's  what we thought.   
               
 
Q:  And then  you said you had to leav
e your school?              
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And where did you go ?             
                          
 
A:  For one year we went to the school that was orga
nized in Rome and --                   
               
              
Q:  What kind of school was it?
                 
                 
 
A:  It was the gymn asium in the lyceum; 
that was what it called, you know, the high 
school.  And we had Jewish teachers, you know; 
they also had to leav
e the university, so 
they became our teachers.  Th
ey were very skilled, and it 
was a very positive experience 
for me.  But then unfortunately
 I had to leave it because, yo
u know, we had to  hide so 
there was --                
 
Q:  So you were in this Jewish gymn
asium for how long?           
 
A:  Only one year.                   
                            
 
Q:  One year?                       
               
              
 
A:  Yes, mm-hmm.                    
                             
 

Q:  Did you sense any apprehen sion among the other 
students in this new school?          
                         
A:  It was a very, very happy experience 
for us.  We finally found, you know, our 
friends -- Jewish friends.  We had parties 
in the afternoon, you 
know, and were just 
enjoying being together.     
                          
                         
 
Q:  And you felt free to go to an yb
ody's house still?            
 
A:  Oh, yes, yes.                   
               
              
 
Q:  At that time?          
                   
                   
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  No, no restrictions?               
                          
 
A:  Yes, mm-hmm.                    
                             
 
Q:  Okay.  So then the year passed,
 and then what ha
ppened?      
 
A:  And then I continue -- I went to -- just fo
r to learn English in a private school just in 
case, you know, we should leave the country , 
my  father thought it would be important 
for me to know another language.  So I went to a private school.     
 
Q:  Was this a private Jewish school?     
                       
 
A:  No, was nuns, in fact, was --        
                        
 
Q:  And you were permitted to go?        
                        
 
A:  Yes, yes.                      
               
               
 
Q:  Now, you and your parents were still living in  your 
same apartment?                     
               
              
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Okay.  And you went to this scho
ol for how long?             
 
A:  Well, as long as we didn't have to hide 
so probably  year and a half or two and th en 
--                        
Q:  But there was no problem that you as a young Jewish girl getting in
to the school?           
                  
A:  No.  These were French nu
ns in Ro me.  Also I went to the English nuns who have -- 
who give a certificate, you know, 
to learn English.  That's where I went, yes.
                        
 
Q:  And they were very accepting?       
                         
 
A:  Yes.  We thought, you know, to go in to 
a religious school wouldn't last much.  And 
the public school we were not allowed.  
 

Q:  How did you feel as a young child not 
being allowed to go to public school?  Was 
that very upsetting to you?                  
 
A:  Yes, it was.                    
               
              
 
Q:  What were your thoughts if you rememb
er?                     
 
A:  Well, I felt like, you know, rejection, yes,
 a rejection. And I thought that this would 
pass and that I would be able to go back , 
but I never did.  And that changed my  life 
completely.  
 
Q:  So you were in this school -- this
 school run by the nuns learning English?         
                
               
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And still living in your apartment?   
                       
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  With your parents?               
                            
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And was your father still able to wo

A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  So he was still going to 
work?               
                
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Did your mother go to -- was sh

A:  No, she never worked.              
                          
 
Q:  She stayed home.                 
                            
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  And then  what happened
?  What was the next --                
 
A:  The next was, you know, when  the Germ
ans started to ask -- you know, the -- Rome 
was occupied, you know; meanwhile we ha
d gone thro ugh all the -- you know, the 
changes, and Ro me was occupied  by th e Nazi. 
 After they got these relation of Badoglio 
and the king and -- And so they  ask for -- you know, fo r gold.   
 
Q:  They asked the Jewish community?     
                        
 
A:  The Jewish community  telling us, you know
, that if we would give 50 kilograms of 
gold, they will leave the Roman Jews alone
, you know, and we 
would continue our 

lives.  And so in 36 hours we 
were able to collect the 50 kilo
grams of gold.  It was said 
that the Pope, you know, Pa
celli, had help us to fill,
 you know, the difference, you 
know, but it wasn 't tru e.  We were able to do it all by ourselves.  A nd -- but 
unfortunately, you know, they --          
                        
                        
 
Q:  So this was family jewelry?        
                          
 
A:  Everything that we could get, ye
s.  Yes, ev erything.         
 
Q:  Did you as a child have to give 
up anything --               
 
A:  Yes, yes.  I gave up my  bat mitzvah ring 
and things, you know, th
at I collected, yes.  
My family, they -- you know, their 
wedding rings, everything.     
                 
                 
 
Q:  Were you very upset as a child to do
 this?                   
 
A:  Of course.  But we were trying, you kno
w, to save our lives, you know.  We started 
with our lives; we had to do wh
at they told  us to do.  There was no choice, so we had to 
do it.  And -- but then , you know, they went 
to the synagogue and ac
tually went to the 
synagogue, and evid ently they got all our 
names, and they never kept their promise 
because on October 16th, that's --
 you know, they came in ea
ch house.                
                   
 
Q:  They  came to your house?           
                          
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And were you home?       
                                   
 
A:  I was home.  You know, I was home with my
 mother and my sister.  My sister was -
- just got married, and she was four months
 pregnant.  And in the morning 6:00 th ey 
went all over the section of Ro me called Tr
astevere with machine guns and -- Excuse 
me for a moment.  This, you know, rememb eri
ng makes me -- And we woke up, and our 
neighbor, such a nice person, she came to 
our door, she say, "Run, run because the 
Nazis, the SS are down stairs, and they'r e getting all the Jewish families, and I don't 

know what they're  going 
to do with them."  
So  we never had the ch an ce to get dressed; 
we just ran out of the house. 
 And we saw, saw the soldiers
 right at the corner of our 
building, but we ran.  We ran away and --        
               
               
 
Q:  How big was your apartment build ing?  
                       
 
A:  I wish I brought the picture with me.  
But it was, you know, like a apartment house.  
And there were about, I would say, three or 
four more Jewish family.  And fortunately 
they didn't come up.  I don't know why; mayb
e they didn't have our address or wh at, but 
they just stopped right in fr
ont of our house.      
 
Q:  And you looked out your window and saw them on the corner?   
 

A:  Yes.  They took families I didn't know across the street.    
 
Q:  But they did not come 
into your building?                    
 
A:  They didn't come in our -- in our
 house.  They  didn't.       
 
Q:  What was your neighbor's name who came to warn you?          
 
A:  Her name was Carmella Pellegrini; sh
e was a pharmacist.  She owned a pharmacy 
not far away from us.  And wh
en I go to Rome, I always go to  say hello to her son 
because they had become our friends forever, 
yes.                     
                       
 
Q:  So it was you and your preg nant sister
?                      
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And your parents?                 
                           
 
A:  And -- no.  My father -- My father rea
lized, you know, that it 
was dangerous for the 
men to be in the house because  they were collecting men to bring them to the war zone 
for labor.     
 
Q:  When did they start to do that?      
                        
 
A:  They started soon after the collection of
 the gold, started right away.  So the men 
were not in the house anymore; only the women 
were left in the house.            
                        
 
Q:  And where was your father?          
                         
 
A:  And my  father decide to have a hernia
 operation; he had been
 needing it for a long 
time, so he thought this would be a good time 
to have it, you know, 
and stay in hiding.  
And that's where he was that morning.  
                      
                     
 
Q:  Of October?                     
               
              
 
A:  Yes.  October 16.  My mother and I ra
n.  And my  sister -- one of our cousin who 
was Catholic had promised, you know, to she
lter her if, you know, there was need, so 

she went there.     
 
Q:  Your sister went to her -- your 
Catholic cousin?             
 
A:  Yes, she did.  And my  mo ther and 
I first stopped to  a friend's house, you know, 
where we used to live to see 
if they were home.  But the house was empty already; they  
already taken them.  In fact, they died.         
               
               
 
Q:  What do you mean where 
you used to live?      
               
 
A:  Before, before this apartment 
where we lived, you know.      
 

Q:  Oh, you had lived  somewher
e else?             
               
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Where?               
                    
                    
 
A:  The same section of Rome, not far away 
from us, yes.  So we stopped th ere, and the 
house was empty; they already had gone,  yes.     
                            
                            
 
Q:  And what did you do then?           
                         
 
A:  So my  mo ther took the telephone, and 
she thought of calling, you know, our cousin 
because she had told us that she would go
 back home.  She was hiding, and she had 
decided to  go back home because the ch
ildren didn't lik e the hotel where she was 
staying.  And sh e was already, you know, been 
taken out, so she wasn 't there; she didn't 
answer.  Then we got really, you know, scar
ed, and we got into a trolley car, and we 
went to my father's hospital.     
                     
                     
 
Q:  Was there much confusion on the street
s?                     
 
A:  No, no.                        
               
               
 
Q:  Was it quiet?                    
                            
 
A:  Everything was normal.  Everything wa
s normal, just, you know, we would see -- 
but we always used to see,
 you know, the SS going all over 
the city, so we didn't -- I 
didn't  see any, you know, 
other Jews, you know, taken,
 no, I didn't fortunately. 
 
Q:  So you decided to  go to  the hospital? 
                       
 
A:  Yes, yes.  So we went to the hospita
l, and we knew, you know, the nun that was 
taking care of my  father -- Suor Foncina was 
her name -- she was very, very nice.  And 
she told my mother th
at she could stay but there was no room for me or for my  sister; 
you know, was a small hospital r
oom so -- So then my fathe
r, you know, tried to find a 
place.  Meanwhile, the first few nights I slept 
all over I could.  I slept in my maid's 
house; I slept in another convent; I slept wh
erever I could, you know.          
                       
                      
Q:  With your mother?                
                            
 
A:  No, no, alone.  My 
mother stayed in the 
hospital but --      
 
Q:  You were the one that had to --      
                        
 
A:  Yes.  I didn't  know where to go.     
                        
 
Q:  How did you feel being separated fro
m your mo th er?  Because you were how old 
then?  You were --           
                   
 

A:  About 18, I think.                
                           
 
Q:  Eighteen?                       
               
              
 
A:  A few years old, yes.  i don't know -- I ju
st -- You know, I didn't have any clothes.  I 
didn't  have a -- I just slept wherever I could;
 I ate where I could, you know.  I just -- I 
tried to get in touch with othe
r of my relatives, cousins, to
 see where they stayed.  In 
fact, I found my  cousin, they were staying 
in a convent.  So she says sleep over, you 
know, here for tonight and then see what ha
ppens tomorrow and --            
 
Q:  Were you able to stay in touch 
with your parents?            
 
A:  With my parents?  Yes, I could go -- 
                        
 
Q:  You could stay in touch?  
                  
                 
 
A:  Yes, I could go there whenev er I wa
nted, but I couldn't sleep, you know, was 
impossible because other people -- you know, 
other nurse or doctors would come during 
the night, they would, you kn
ow, find it unusual that, you know, there would be three in 
a room, so I could not stay.       
                     
 
Q:  Did you look very Je
wish?                 
                   
 
A:  No, I don't think I do.  Do  I?  Well, 
due to the fact that I'm blonde, so nobody 
thought that I would be 
Jewish but --      
 
Q:  So when  you walked down  the 
street, it wasn't obvious?       
 
A:  Yeah.  No.  No.  In fact
, all my relatives, after we found
 each other, they
 used to tell 
me "Could you go to  my  hous
e, you know, and get me this
 and get me that?"  And I 
would go and not realizing, you know, ho
w dangerous it was b
ecause nobody would 
think that I was Jewish.               
                          
 
Q:  What kind of papers did you have when  -- at th
at point when you were 18 ?            
              
             
A:  Well --                         
               
              
 
Q:  Did you have any special 
papers?             
                
 
A:  No, I didn't, but I needed an identificati
on because they used to  stop you in th e street 
and ask you for iden tification. 
So somebody told me to go to  
this convent which is in the 
center of Rome near Piazza di Spagna.  And I 
went there, and I met this Father Filippo; 
that's all I remember about 
him, but he was very nice --                      
                                   
 
Q:  Did the convent have a sp
ecial name?          
               
 

A:  I don't know.  It's the Do minican prie
st, but I don't know; I don't reme mb er the 
name.  Yes.  And he gave me this identifi
cation.  He took my identification practically, 
and he changed the name from Funaro with
 an "n" to Fumaro
 with an "m."  
 
Q:  And why did he do that?            
                          
 
A:  Because Funaro is a very Jewish name
, but Funaro  could puzzle other people, you 
know, not knowing that it had been changed 
so -- I don't know how safe could that be 
but --         
 
Q:  So he gave you fresh papers?        
                         
 
A:  No, no.  He just corrected
 mine.                             
 
Q:  Oh, he changed the "n" to  
an "m"?                            
 
A:  So it looked, you know --           
                         
 
Q:  So you had your original 
paper?              
                
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And on the origin al papers 
did it say that you were Jewish?  
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  No.  That wasn 't --              
                            
 
A:  No, no.                        
               
               
 
Q:  -- listed?                      
               
              
 
A:  They didn't ask for religion.        
                        
 
Q:  Okay.  So he changed that.  And 
th en what did you do?  Wh ere did you 
go?                   
                    
A:  So meanwhile, my father 
was trying to  find us a place. 
 And, you know, I told you 
he was in the lumb er busin ess, so he got in
 the construction of ma
ny buildings.  And he 
called up one of his friend who was an architect
, and he didn't  have to explain mu ch; he 
understood right away .  And he 
said that he would, you know
, find a place for us.  They 
had just built this place n
ear the University of Rome 
for women coming out of town , 
you know, and attending the un
iversities.  A nd there was br
and-new building still there.  
I don't know if you've ever b
een in Rome --        
 
Q:  Like a dormitory, you mean?         
                         
 
A:  Yes, like a hostel, you 
know, for -- And the Moth er Superior said yes, she had 
already hidden other people for political or raci
al or so.  She said yes right away.  And 

meanwhile my  sister had been sent out of the 
house of our cousins; they didn't  keep her, 
yes, so --                                                 
 
Q:  Because they felt it wasn 't safe?    
                        
 
A:  No, it wasn't safe because, you know, 
they  put posters all ove
r Rome that, you know, 
whoever would shelter Jews would be sentenced, so
 --                        
                         
 
Q:  These were posters on the street?     
                       
 
A:  Yes, yes.  So they got 
very scared, and they sent her out, and my  sister was very 
upset, of course.                         
 
Q:  And she was far along in
 her pregnancy?       
               
 
A:  Four months pregnant, yes.  So she came
 with me to the conv
en t.  Her husband also 
was hiding in the country near Rome, so sh
e didn't  know where to
 go, and she stayed 
with me in the convent on a
nd off, yes.  And --            
                     
 
Q:  Your experience up to this point
 with the Catholic church was very 
positive?                 
                    
A:  It was, yes.  Yes.  They were very un
derstanding.  Of course, they tried to convert 
us, and my  sister had to play th e organ in ch
urch.  You know, we had to go to sing, the 
prayers, you know, and everything.            
                            
 
Q:  Was this familiar to you?  Were thes
e ritu als and ceremonies familiar to you since 
you had Catholic relatives? 
               
 
A:  In a way, yes, you know, we were fami
liar.  But we had to learn all their prayers, 
yes.                 
                   
 
Q:  How did you feel about that?        
                         
 
A:  I felt th at I was praying my God.  I felt so
 much that I n
eeded pray that I didn't care 
if I was in the church or in
 the synagogue.  Th
ey have, you know, th
e confessional, you 
know, was very comforting to me.              
               
              
 
Q:  So you and your si
ster were to gether, she was four 
months pregnant and you went to 
this dormitory, you said?               
 
A:  Yes.  We had very  comfortable rooms, 
and it was very cold , ve
ry cold, terribly cold 
and --                                  
 
Q:  What time of year are we talking abou
t?                      
 
A:  We're talking about November, Decemb
er, you know.  From October, you know, by 
the time we went there was November.       
 

Q:  And it was cold?                  
                           
 
A:  Yes, yes.                      
               
               
 
Q:  What did you have with you?  Did yo
u have --                 
 
A:  I didn 't have --                 
                            
 
Q:  -- clothes?                     
               
              
 
A:  No, I didn't have anything yet, you kno
w.  But finally our neig hbor, you know, she 
took everything from our ap
artment because our apartmen
t was -- how can you say -- 
taken by the Roman --                        
                                
 
Q:  Confiscated.                     
                            
 
A:  Confiscated.  And they put in it -- in
 the apartment people who had co me from the 
south of Italy.  You know, 
during the occupation of the Am
ericans some of the Italian 
Fascists, you know, ran north -- or antiFascist
s, I should say, ran 
north. And so we had 
to give the apartment, you 
know, to them, because the wa
y they continue the war, the 
raids, they couldn't liv e in Naples or in ot
her country of the south.  So  our apartment 
was occupied by this family, but our neig
hbor took ev erything, you know, our clothes 
and our valuables --         
                  
 
Q:  Personal things?                  
              
             
 
A:  Yes, personal things in her apartment.  S o  once in a while, 
I used to go to the 
pharmacy, you know, that she owned --        
 
Q:  To your neighbor's pharmacy? 
                                
 
A:  Yes, and she would, you know, give me 
a package with the stu
ff that I needed.  So 
slowly I got, you know, my  stuff back. And I 
stayed in that conven t for nine months, 
you know.          
 
Q:  And what did you do during
 the day?           
               
 
A:  Well, during the day we could have -- 
you know, go anywhere because the curfew 
was at 6:00.  So I used to 
run  to  my  mo th er an d  see my  
mother and my father.  And I 
had already a boyfriend, so I used to go to  se
e him if I could.  And 
then I got into -- you 
know, get in touch with some of
 the partisans; already, you 
know, they were formed.  So 
I belonged  to some kind of organization 
that was called a Christian, you know, for 
freedom, something like that.  And we used
 to ask each other, bring news from one 
place to another and see that everybody woul
d be sheltered, they would need food, 
things like that.               
 

Q:  How did they get in touch with you or how
 did you get in contac
t with this partisan 
group?                                
 
A:  Well, we'd  me et, you know, somewhere fo
r coffee -- or there was no coffee, but for 
something.  Not in the homes
, it's somewhere and --         
                    
                    
 
Q:  And you heard ab out the group thro ugh friends origin ally --  
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  -- and you got involved?            
                         
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And these were young peop
le like you?                        
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And did you say you had regular me
etings or you --           
 
A:  No.  No.  Never, never, never.       
                        
 
Q:  And it was just informal how you 
got information?            
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And you carried messages?           
                         
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Who did you carry messages to?       
                        
 
A:  Well, other people that, you know
, might need help.          
 
Q:  Did you ever feel your life in danger
 --                     
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  -- when you were a courier?         
                         
 
A:  No.  No.  No.  I talked to Ge
rman soldiers all the times. 
I --                   
                     
                     
 
Q:  In wh at language?  In Italian?      
                         
 
A:  Italian, yes.                   
               
              
 
{Pause in the recording.}     
                  
                 
 
Q:  Courier with the partisans and you we
re talking to German soldiers?      
                      
                      

A:  Yes.  Occasionally, occasionally, but 
occasionally.  If I would meet somebody, I 
would never, you know, show wh at I was or
 what and not realizing, you know, how 
dangerous it was.          
 
Q:  Did you have any particul
arly difficult experiences at 
this time, the 
end of '43, 
beginning of '44, any frighteni
ng experiences, anything th at was difficult?  
                      
 
A:  Well, of course, you know, at night esp
ecially we could hear 
shooting continuously .  
You know, the partisans were starting to fight 
also in the city.  And also the Allied had 
landed in  An zio, so we could hear the war ad
vancing very closely. 
 And we wished they 
would co me already, but I mean, while we di
dn't know our destiny, we didn't know if 
they would go -- if they  would keep their 
promise that Rome was open city or not.  
Would th ey destroy it?  We didn't  know.  
We didn't  know what was expect. And that 
was very scary, you know.  And also we ha
d two very bad air raid
s.  I lived in the 
section of Rome called San Lo
renzo near the Catholic and 
Jewish cemete ry.  And seems 
like the Germans were hiding, you know, th eir supplies in there.  So we had two very  
bad air raids and --            
                    
 
Q:  Where were you at the time?         
                         
 
A:  I was, you know, coming down  the stairs. 
 Right in front of the window I see this 
airplane coming, you know, and th e bomb s fa
lling.  And I got on the ground, you know, 
and I was very, very scared, yes.  And my wh
ole family, in fact, got very scared because 
they knew that I was the onl
y one living there.  But a
ll the windows broke in the 
build ing, but fortunately, you know --  
 
Q:  How was your sister making out being pr
egnant at this time? How were things 
going?                     
                      
 
A:  Well, she was very  brav e, but the nuns  were getting very  -- the nurses -- the nuns 

were getting very  nervous; you know, they  didn't 
want a baby born  in 
their convent.  So 
every night they used to
 knock at our door, is your sister
 feeling all right?  Do  you th ink 
she's going to have a baby?  And what.  My si
ster said, "I don't know wh at to do.  Where 
should I go?"  Well, finally my brother-in-law '
s family, they decide 
to rent an apartment 
in a very nice section of Rome with false na
mes, making believe they  also were refugees 

from the south.  So my sister
 was able to go to
 live with her husban
d's family, and she 
had the baby in April.                
              
             
 
Q:  Of '44?              
                    
                    
 
A:  Yes.  And my first nephew Stefano wa
s born, you know, during 
this period with the 
false name.  And I remember very clearly th
at we were in the room and so mebody came 
to visit us; we never knew who this pe
rson was --                                     
 

Q:  This is in the hospital?           
                          
 
A:  Yes, because my sister felt that I knew her and --           
 
Q:  You thought she knew her?          
                          
 
A:  And we didn't want to say our name
s so was --                
 
Q:  Did you ever find out who it was     
                        
 
A:  No, no, no.  But, you know, we were ve
ry -- you know, pretty 
scared, but thank God, 
you know, everything wa
s fine and then -- 
 
Q:  And then  she and the baby went back to  he
r in-laws living under the false name?      
                         
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And so you were living by yo
urself still in this dormitory?  
 
A:  I was alone, yes.  Yes.  I stay ed there all the nine months, yes.          
                        
                        
  
Q:  And you -- during -- you were work ing 
for the partisans during the day?              
                             
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  Because there was a curfew at night?  
                       
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And what did you -- What else did you do, or was th
at full time?               
                     
                    
A:  At night we would get 
together because there were 
many, you know, other people 
hiding.                  
                     
 
Q:  In this dormitory?                
                           
 
A:  Yes, also children, yes.  And 
we used to get together --     
 
Q:  These were Jewish children?         
                         
 
A:  Yes.  And meet and sew 
and, you know, do th ings because
 we could not buy clothes.  
So we used to buy yarn and knit our st
ockings and sweaters and things like that
.                     
 
Q:  What was the food situation like?     
                       
 
A:  The food situation was fu
ll of worms.  You know, was kept in the -- probably in the 
basement of the Vatican somewhere and -- 
but it was enough, you know, it was enough 
to keep alive.  Of course, I was very young, 
and I was very hungry.  But I used to go to 
my  mo ther and my  father's hospital and open
 up the ro om and if I would find them, take 

a little piece of cheese or bread or whatever 
I would find and leave a note I was hungry.  
And I eat and go back to the conv
ent.                
                  
 
Q:  How was their health at that time, your parents' health?     
 
A:  It was okay.  You know, my father kept
 his wound open for a lo
ng time in order to 
stay in the hospital.      
                
 
Q:  Kept his wound open?              
                           
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  How did he do th at?      
                                   
 
A:  The doctor, you know, kept it open so  that  he could show that -- you know, that he 
was still needed the organization.
 And then finally he had to 
get better.  Also he needed, 
you know, to get in touch to 
protect his business.  One of 
our accountan t, he, you know, 
kept the firm going all while we were hiding
; he was Catholic, and he took care of it, 
yes.            
 
Q:  What was the name of your father's
 business?                 
 
A:  Dieter Del Monte.                
                            
 
Q:  Was the name of the lumb er busin ess?  
                       
 
A:  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  And --             
                           
 
Q:  So he got in touch -- you said
 your father got in touch with this --     
                         
                         
A:  Accountant, yes.                 
                            
 
Q:  And how were things going?         
                          
 
A:  Well, there was no business at that time. 
 But at least, you know, we kept it going fo r 
a while, you know.                    
 
Q:  When -- Before the war was your father's
 business catering to all different kinds of 
customers, Jews, nonJews?              
 
A:  Yes, carpenter, construction, a
ny kind of people need ing lumb er.        
                                               
Q:  How was your health during th is time when y
ou were living in th e dormitory?          
                         
A:  I got very sick, you know; I don't know 
if it was from the food or what.  It was 
typhoid fever.  I was v ery sick.           
 
Q:  Did you get good medical at
tention?                          
 

A:  No, I couldn't call anybody. 
 But our family doctor, he was a holy man; he was very, 
very, very  nice.  He was Catholic, but 
he belonged to some
 kind of Catholic 
organization.  I think he was taking care even of th
e Pope sometimes and --   
             
 
Q:  What was his name?                
                           
 
A:  His name was Pietro Borromeo.  Borromeo
 is a very noble family in Rome; it's , you 
know, very well known family.  And he came to
 take care of me, yes.            
                        
 
Q:  And he brought you 
medicine?               
                  
 
A:  Yes.  Yes.                     
               
               
 
Q:  Was that a tremendous risk for him?  
                        
 
A:  It was.  It was, yes.  And he was a very
 old man, so I really appreciated what he did, 
yes, for me.                     
 
Q:  And so then you recovered?         
                          
 
A:  Yes.  Well, I was, you know, very young
 and healthy.  So  fortunately, you know, I 
recovered.  But as I had typh
oid previously during the begi
nning of the war.       
               
 
Q:  You came down with typhoid?          
                        
 
A:  Yes.  It was very serious the firs
t time, so --              
 
Q:  This is when you were living with
 your family?               
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And he took care of you at that tim
e also?                   
 
A:  Yes, mm-hmm.                    
                             
 
Q:  I wanted to ask you just
 to go back a few 
years in time, you said that when you 
changed schools and you had to
 learn the Fascist philosophy, how did you feel about 
that as a young wo man?                        
                  
                 
 
A:  My father was a so cialist, so we grew 
up, you know, in a different atmosphere.  You 
know, I was very liberal about -- you know, I 
didn't believe in Fasc
ism.  That's  I was 
brought up.  So of course it bothered me 
to wear uniform, you know, and to sing the 
songs or recite poems that I didn't believe 
in it, but you had to.                        
                 
                 
 
Q:  You were a young teen-ager at the time?
                      
 
A:  Well, I was even younger because in el
ementary school, I was seven, eight years 
old, yes.                
                     
 

Q:  I see.  Was that a frightening 
experience for you or just upsetting?     
                        
                        
A:  It became, it became frightening once, 
you know, we knew that
 Mussolini was, you 
know, getting -- his alliance with the German
s then became dangerous.  But at the 
beginning Mussolini had many Jewish friends, 
you know, so we didn't believe that he 
could ever get into that situation, yes,
 mm-h mm.                 
 
Q:  Okay.  We're back, back to '4 4 again.  So you recuperated. Your family doctor 

helped you recuperate.  And 
then  what happened?  Wh at was the next experience you 
remember?            
 
A:  Well, the next experience was the expect
ation, you know; we were hoping that the 
war would advance, you know.  But meanwh
ile, the partisans were getting, you know, 
very organized in Ro me.  So 
that's  when  it happened, th e very bad in cident of Viera 
Thela (ph).  The partisans killed 32 German
s, SS Germans and in the reprisal, th e 
Germans decided to kill 320.  Yes, there 
were many Jews that had been, you know, 
taken in the street, from the st
reet, because we also had Je
wish spies; you know, that 
would point out, you know, who was 
Jews.              
 
Q:  To the Germans?        
                   
                   
 
A:  Oh, yes.  So one of my 
cousin was in Regina Co eli at
 that time w h ich is, you know, 
the jail in Rome.  His name was Giuseppe De
l Monte.  And he was taken, you know, to 
fill --      
 
Q:  The three?                      
               
              
 
A:  And so they were taken,
 you know, one day and taken to
 the -- in the place in the 
Appian Way, that's called Fo
rce Diatini.  And they were
 killed en masse, you know, and 
buried there, that's it, you know
, without any fault, without any 
--  you know.                  
                        
Q:  This was the reprisal?             
                          
 
A:  Yes.  And we didn't know
 what happened to him, you know.  We didn't know, you 
know.  We got in touch with his brothe
r or the sister, what happened, he has 

disappeared.  Where is he?  We know that he's
 in jail; maybe he's in
 the atasse (ph).  
You know, the atasse is where 
they interrogate the Jews wher
e they did terrible things to 
them.  We could hear the scr
eams from what they were doin
g to them.  So we didn't  
know where he was. And then, 
you know, we found out that he
 had been killed, yes.   
 
Q:  How aware were you of these terrible th ings that were
 going on?                          
               
               
A:  Yeah, there like --                
                          
 
Q:  You said  --                    
               
              
 

A:  Yes.  Somebody would tell "You kn
ow what happened?  You know what 
happened?"  But we never knew if it was re
ally true, and we were
 afraid to find out 
because, you know, who could we ask?     
 
Q:  So there was the reprisal?          
                         
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And then --                     
               
              
 
A:  It was just, you know, very scary to se
e the way, you know,  the Germans were all 
over the city, you know.  And people were very
 scared.  They were very -- what can I 
say? -- frightened.   
 
Q:  Now, did your parents leave the hosp
ital ?                   
 
A:  No.                           
                               
 
Q:  They stayed?                    
               
              
 
A:  They  stayed, yes.  They  didn't kn
ow where to go.             
 
Q:  And you were still in th
is dormitory?         
               
 
A:  Yes.                          
                               
 
Q:  And then what was the next --       
                         
 
A:  Then finally, you know, 
they -- the Allies started to 
advance; after Casino, after 
Anzio, you know, they started 
to advance.  So we knew that they would come, but we 
didn't  know what would happen at that point
.  So that night, you know, I called my 
mother and my father, and it was too fa
r away to walk then.  There was no 
transportation at that point; there were onl
y, you know, Germans 
going out, you know, 
like a war in the city, impossible to walk.  
So I called my mother and my father, and I 
say, "What should I do?"  Do 
you think you sh ould try to 
go to your sister, maybe you 
would stay; you know, they live in
 an apartment, shou
ld be safe.  So I went there, and I 
asked if I could stay, you know, at least ove
rnight because maybe during the night, they 
would decide wh at to do, you 
know, the -- if -- stay in Ro
me and -- you know, and fight 
or just go through.  We didn't know.  But I 
was not wanted there.  
They said that they 
didn't  have enough fo od and it would be ve
ry dangerous, you know, I was young and 
attractive, maybe, you know, some Germans 
would co me in the house and follow me.  
So it was near the curfew; it was 6:00, and I had 
to go out, much regr
et of my  sister, but 
there was nothing I could do ab out.  And so
 I went, and that was a very terrible 

experience because that was th
e end of the war; you know, y
ou could see the defeat in 
the soldiers' face.  They were
 drunk; they were 
bleeding all over.  You know, and I run, 
you know.  I stopped somebody, and I said, "P
lease take me."  You know, where I say 

please, please don't bother me, just to reach 
my house.  I have to do it by my self.  And 
finally, you know, I reached th
e convent, and I collapsed 
on the ground, but the nuns 
came out, you know, and th ey took me inside.  
And I decide that I didn't want to sleep 
alone, so I had these two very dear friends; 
they were two old Jewish lady, and they 
were so nice to me.  A nd they say stay in 
our room, and I stayed 
and I spent the night 
there.  And, finally, you know, when I woke
 up in the morning, I could not believe it 
that when  we look out the wi
ndow, we saw soldiers that they didn't look like Germans; 

in fact, they were the Ameri
cans.  And then th e joy exploded, you know.  We ran out, 
and I was very lucky.       
 
Q:  So th at was the day of your liberati
on?                      
 
A:  Yes, it was.                    
               
              
 
Q:  And you went out to the American so
ldiers?                   
 
A:  Yes, yes.                      
               
               
 
Q:  And you could speak English be
cause you had taken English?   
 
A:  Yes.  Yes.                     
               
               
 
Q:  Do you remember a
ny of your meetings, what you said to them? 
 
A:  Oh, we hugged an d kissed and, of course
, you know, the usual s
cenes you can see in 
the movies, give them chewing gum and choc
olate.  But after we moved back  to our 
apartment, we were very fort
unate to have the assistance
 of some soldiers from New 
Zealand, New Zealand, who brought, you know, 
us lots of food from one of my  father's 
clients from south Italy.  So we heard, you 
know, that we had been  starving, and they  
brought cases of food.  They were really very, ve
ry nice to us.                   
 
Q:  Did you go imme diately back  to you
r apartment?               
 
A:  No.  No, I still didn't feel like I wa
nted to  go back, you kno
w; it was like, you know, 
it didn't belong to me anymore.  I just, 
you know, had bad fee
lings, but finally, you 
know --       
 
Q:  So you stayed in th
e convent for a little bit?  
             
 
A:  For a little bit, yes.             
                          
 
Q:  Then went back and your parents were
 there?                  
 
A:  Yes.  We took care of the apartment,
 cleaned and ev erything. then we finally got 
back, and my father was able sl
owly  to start his business.  Then we started to find out all 
the bad news, of course, you know, but also
 the good news because our friends, you 
know, the one that had, you know, gone to
 other country , you kn
ow, especially to 

America, th ey started to come back, you kn
ow.  And that 's how 
I met for the second 
time my  husband.  He had left, you know, Ital
y in 1939.  So we fo
und each other again, 
and we were able to get married, yes.

Q:  Can we talk now a little bit ab out some 
of your thoughts about your experience 
during th e war?  What are your feelings toda
y about how the war influenced you?    
                      
 
A:  It totally changed my life.
                 
                 
 
Q:  In what way?                    
               
              
 
A:  Well, first of all, I told you about th
e school that, you know, I feel the lack, you 
know, of education.  I wish I could have 
continue wh ich I did.  Later on I went to 
Queens College, and I continue.  My brothe
r-in-law is the head of the Department -- 
Italian Department, Queens Co llege.  Maybe yo
u have read his book, Sergio Pacifici.  
He has written many literature books, so he -- 
after my husbanddied, 
he advised me to 
continue college to be able to teach Italian. 
 But unfortunately, I wa
s unable.  I had four 
children, you know, and lo st -- already engage
d, you know, and there were in university. 
And I had a very little one; after 14 years, I 
had a little b oy, Robert
, who is now 30 years 
old.  So  I had to follow him; it was too mu ch 
for me to continue.  
So that influenced a 
lot because, you know, my education.  Be
sides that, you know, I had -- I became more 

religious, I would say, ever.  You know, I 
don't go mu ch to synagogue or things like 
that, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel 
that I've been so honor
ed to talk about what 
happened  to  me because I have nightmares,
 still have nightmares, you know, of what 
happened to -- especia
lly to my cousin Julia who, you
 know, died  with a husband and 
two small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they 
were only five and three years old.  And 
I constantly pray for them, you know.  And th
is kept me, you know, in my  faith.  All 
sisters tried to convert me; I would never, 
never, never, never, never.  And th at's  very 

important to me.  My family now, they'r e a
ll married.  Myyoung 
one is married to a 
Korean, but he got married in 
the Jewish faith.  My other s
on is married to an Irish, but 
he has kept his faith.  My other sons, you know,
 he kept his faith.  And also if we don't 
show, I hope that I have, you know, taught
 this to my children that, you know, how 
important it is.  I don't care what's, you kno
w, they're outside going to synagogue or 
serving, what the faith will be
, and that's  very important.  
Also, you know, I appreciate 
the fact that this brought me 
to live in this country .  I go of
ten to Italy, but I could not 
live there anymore.  I feel that this coun
try gives the opportunity
, you know, to keep 
your faith, to wo rk.  I didn't have any educ
ation, but I was able always to support 
myself.  M y  husband didn't  
leave me rich, but I was able
, you know, to have all my  
children have their degree and their professi
ons.  And I could never have accomp lished 
if I had stayed in Italy.  I myself, you know
, I decided office work
 wasn't for me, and I 
took care of my catering and my
 chef work , and I been  very
 successful.  So thank God 
for America.                      
                           
 
Q:  Do you receive repara
tions, war reparations?                 
 
A:  More what?                      
               
              
 
Q:  War reparations, payments.          
                         
 
A:  No.  Never.  Why should I?  Sh ould I?  I don't know.  No.  I never 
asked for it.              
                    
Q:  Never applied?  So you said you 
co mmunicated to your ch ildren about your 
experiences during the war?  You were open?  
 
A:  Yes.  This is now lately especially it is
 like an obsession to me.  I have to publish 
something about it, and I want to --  you 
know, my  children, my  grandchildren to
 know.                 
 
Q:  Why?                          
                               
 
A:  Because they have not be
en, you know, so unaw
are what's going on

They  have to be prepared.  
We were not. They came with
 gun, and we just went, like 
sheep.  That wasn 't the way to do it.  We s
hould have been  active.
  And when  they say 
now in Israel, you know, they are too -- you 
know, too war-minded, things like that, I 

approve because, you know, we have to defe
nd ourselves.  We were -- You know, we 
just went; we were too innocent about it, so I 
want my  children to be very 
aware of this.
