she had survived the war, and she wasn™t well herself, and she wanted to come wi th 

a friend, and the two would live with me, and take care of me. But, unfortunatel y,

people who had never been abroad, or Œ

A: And people who came to our house could not believe Œ first of all, we had a very 

large kitchen, we had help. And Œ but they could not Œ they had never seen people 

have two Œ  

Q: Refrigerators. Yes, and certainly for the time. I mean, in the 1930s, yeah.

A: For the ti me. Even t he 30s, to have a refrigerator was a luxury.

 about your home that you grew up in. Was it a house, or an 

apartment? 

A: No. My parents, I think Œ I™m not sure whether it was 30 Œ I was born ™28, ™31, I 

don™t know the dat e, but the buil d Œ there was a new buil ding in this Œ in this 
suburb, that was very close to the slaughterhouse, which was giant, blocks and 
blocks and blocks. And it was Œ because of the slaughterhouse, it wasn™t a fancy 

neighborhood. 

Q: No, I wouldn™t i magine that it could be. 

A: No. And a building went up, and my father decided to move the original store to 

that new building, and customize the first floor of the building. 

Q: You mean the ground floor, or the first floor as we™re tal king Œ 
A: No, first floor over t he Œ over the business. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And customized it i nto a four bedroom apartment, which we had, with two and a 

half baths.

A: Totally. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: Totally. 
Q: So, it was an Œ

A: It was a brand new building. 

Q: So it would have been Œ 

A: It had three floors.

If she were Œ was caught living with a Jewish family, she ge Œ 

Q: She™d get in trouble. 

A: That would be the end of her. So, unbeknownst to anyone, we Œ we had Œ coul d 

no longer have help in the house unless they were Jewish. And you could find very 
little Jewish help, but t here were some. She decided to get her own apart ment Œ or 
m y parents, I don™t know what the arrangements were. But she worked in the sto Œ 

in the office of the business. 

Q: Oh wow. 

A: Because she Œ she decided she would not leave our fami ly. 

Q: Wow. Wow.That musthave meantsomethi ng.
 

A: So, I have a letter to the effect that when my father tried to establish what had 
happened to the business, she wrote a major letter of what her input with the fami ly, 
and what she had seen over the years, and Œ 

Q: That must have been crucial in helping Œ i n helping fi Œ you know, establish 

what kind of assets there were, and what had been lost.

had two living roo Œ two rooms, one daily livi ng room Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ one special for company. 
Q: It™s like a Œ I™m sorry I™m enteri ng, but it™s sort of like toda y™s famil y room, i n 
American homes, and then the livi ng room Œ 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Œ 
when company comes.
 
A: Well, the family room was every da y, we ate there, everything was going on i n 

the family room, must be like a family room, but we called it a second dining room. 

We had a formal dining room, and this. But m y mother would have the small 
Christ mas tree in t he good living room, for the help, on Christ mas eve, which was 
unbelievabl e. And I followed suit later on Œ  

Q: Did you? 

A: Œ because that™s what I learned, and had a lot of trouble with m y rabbi about it.

according to how t heir human relat ions worked. 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: You know?  

A: Well, it™s interesting, I Œ I didn™t understand it at the time, but after I was 
married, and I had a Catholic nursemaid in m y home, I realized how unusual it was 
for my mother Œ I didn™t keep a kosher home. But for m y mother to have a 

Christ mas tree, that was really Œ 

Q: That™s a lot. 

A: That was a lot. 

Q: That™s a lot, yeah.  

A: So, but  I didn™t Œ you know, I didn™t understand it at the ti me. But my mother 
always felt, in order to have Œ you have to observe everybody™s preference. And as

Like a brownie uniform. But thi s was a 
Hitler
 youth, and the y were no longer 
allowed to talk to me. So, suddenly I had no friends, no one to be wit h, and that was 
a little difficult. However, then I i mmediately, within months, I was forced to go to 

a Jewish school. And so I got Œ had all new friends. 
Q: So, you were five years old when 
Hitler
 came to power.

A: Absolutely. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And m y mother had gotten a number, very unusual. She had gone to

had been an arm y officer in the first World War, as a Jew. I have 
his army papers.

 will not touch me because I was an officer. My mother said, 
whatever you want t o do, I am leavi ng when my number comes up. The number 

came up, and unfortunately my nursemaid had given m y sister and I a Hanukkah 

present, a C hrist mas present of a bicycle each. 

Q:Oh m y goodness.
 
A: And we went and tried out our bic ycle when there was a little snow on the 

ground. My sister was a little heavy and clum sy, and fell off her bike and broke her 

hip.  

Q:Oh m y gosh.
 
A: And at the ti me, you could not go to a doctor in your area unless he was Jewish.

A: Œ couldn™t move. We had a hospital bed put into the fanc y dini ng room, which 

looked outside, and she was there for three months, in this cast. And when she Œ 

during that ti me, our number came up. Well, m y parents couldn™t leave with a child 
in a cast, that doesn™t work. 
Q: Right.  

A: And when she got out of the cast, she couldn™t walk. Her hip had t o be re-broken 

by a Jewish orthopedic doctor. It was terrible. So we missed our chance of getting 

out of 
Germany

they had pl undered all t hese shops. There was stuff all over the street:  clothes, 
bicycles, whate Œ what ever the shop sold, was on this major street. And we coul dn™t 

Œ how coul d this happen? So we got to school, and the minute 
we got toour 

classroom, we were tol d to go to an assembly, which was outside in a courtyard. 

The two schools had two different buildings. And one of the bui ldings was on fire. 

And needless to sa y, there was a little confusion in the courtyard. And the rector 

spoke on a microphone and said, you are t o try to reach your parents by phone. We 
didn™t have cell phones, but there were telephones in Œ at school, or get on the next

recovery, and the surgery was only done i n

Q: What happened? 
A: We 
Œ we waited until dark, to be met by m y dad. And in the car was m y 
grandmother, my mother, waiting for us. And, where are we going? My father said, 

we™re going to some lovely people, friends of mi ne, who have a farm, about three 

hours away. And we™re just going to have a litt le picnic Œ m y mot her had packed a 
lunch Œ we™re going to have a little picnic. And little had we known what had gone 
on during the da y at Œ in Œ in the business. We had no Œ I had no i dea. So we drove 

all night, and we finally came to t his town where we were supposed t o be with 

friends. My father got out of the car and went into a pub, to call his friend and say 

we were close by. And the friend said, don™t come. The Nazis have j ust come into 

m y town, and you will not be safe here. Just keep driving. So we drove through the 

whole night. And when we had to relieve ourself, there Œ 
couldn™t go anywhere, you
 
went Œ you made do. 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 And so we never got Œ we were nowhere.

timeIsaw my house, my home.
 
Q: Really? 

A: And m y nursemaid was there, and we had dinner, whatever, and t hen we rented 

an apart ment  somewhere. I don™t know where. I Œ I have very little recollection of

know whet her I have bl ocked that out of my mind completely. However, m y father, 
the next da y that we got home, m y father disappeared. Totally disappeared. And for 

three da ys, we had no i dea where, how, what. The Germans had taken him, and 

thrown him into prison. Which was Œ every ot her man was taken off the street, for 

whatever reason. No reason whatsoever, just pull him. Fortunately enough, the Œ he 
had friends, an attorne y, who got hi m out of jail. That was the first ti me. And after 
that, things were terribl e, because he had to go back to the business every da y to tr
y 
to finalize plans. This was Œ then they were forced to sell the business. But what 

happened during that time, I can™t tell you, except that m y father was taken again, 

oh, I think right in December, somewhere i n December, and never knew how m y 

father got out of jail, until m y mother was on her deathbed, and she said, I think I 

ought to tell you somet hing I have never revealed to anyone. So she t old my sister 
and m yself how she managed to get my father, and I don™t think I ought to tell that 
story. 

Q: Oh, you™ve piqued m y curiosi ty. Can you go around it a little bit? Is there any 

way 
Œ  
A: Well, I Œ she found a wa y Œ

Q: Oh, dear. 
A: Œ to engage the head Nazi in an evening. And my mother di dn™t drink, but she 

spent the night wit h thi s person at a bar. And every ti me she didn™t feel well, she 

would relieve herself, and start drinking al l over again, unt il he was Œ i-it™s just too 

involved.  
Q: Oka y. 
A: However, he signed a paper in his stupor. She said to me the best part about this 

story is that he invited her to go home, she™s a very attracti ve woman. And she said 

she™d love t o. And it got very invol ved. And she said, but t he only way she woul d 

consent is if he would be so kind, and gi ve his signature, so that her girlfriends, who 

were like herself Œ probably figured she was a lady of the night Œ 
her girlfriends
 

would never believe that he invited her. So, she took out a piece of paper, which 
was a consent to have m y father rel ieved 
from prison.
 
Q:Oh m y gosh.
 
A: She had never told this story. 
Q: Did you think he knew, your father? 

A: I Œ I don™t know if he ever knew. I don™t know. And she Œ thi s was like just 

before she died, she told me. So, I would sa y she Œ she was some lady. 

Q: Yes, yes. And t hank you for sharing that. Thank you.

A: It Œ it was pretty difficult. 
Q: Yes. It i s part of what was the reality, and what somebody had to do in order to 

survive, and help a loved one get out. 

A: I asked her, I sai d, how could you even think of doing this? And she said, when 

you™re in need, 
you do whatever youhavet o. Thatwas my mother.
 
Q: Amazing. Thanks. We™re going to break for lunch now. Thank you. 
[break] 

Oka y, so 
Susi
, before the break, before the break, we were talking about 
Kristallnacht
, and the days immediately following it, and you menti oned that after 

Œ 
after your 
Œ you drove around that night in t he car, your father was picked up ag Œ 

yet again, and you shared with us how your mother got him out. And I wanted to 

explain a little bit why I wanted to know t his detail, simply because people shoul d 

not have only a sanitized version of what others went through in order to survive. 
And that often, you had to make a tough deci sion. Now your mother told you this 
only on her deathbed. Can you tel l me what kind of thoughts ran through your 

mind? How Œ how you reacted to it? You had said before the break that it gave you 

something, it taught you something. 

A: Well, I Œ I think that  by example, my mother sh Œ enriched my life, because no 

mat ter how difficult times were for her, it was her personality that was positive. 

And any Œ no matt er what challenges she had, she would go at it  in a very positive 

 
Interview with Susi Frank Annes

manner, and not only that, she alwa ys found a little humor in everyt hing. I mean, 
she would do things that we would say would be silly, or craz y. And I™m sure that™s 

the wa y she vented her difficulties. 

Q: By Œ by finding somet hing about it. 

A: I think so. 
Q: Yeah.  
A: And it seemed that friends would gravi tate to her, because she had this charm. I-

It was so i nnate, it was her. 

Q: And she ended up being a savior. 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: So when your father emerged from prison t he second time, was it, or ma ybe the 

third, I Œ I don™t recall.  
A: I don™t know. 
Q: What happened then? How did things progress then? 

A: We left. My sister and I were told we™re going on a vacation. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: I had no clue. We each had a lit tle suitcase, and m y mother said, you can take 

one thing t hat you would like. And, believe it or not, I took a dol l, alt hough I was

not really i nvolved wit h dolls. But there™s a German doll called 
K athe Kruse
, and I 
took my doll, whi ch I have. 

Q: You do? Wow. You still have that? 

A: Yeah, it™s downstairs in the locker room, but I have it. And we were Œ the next 

thing we knew, we were taken to the train stati on. 
Q: By your parents? 
A:By my parents
. And the y Œ the y could not go to the trai n, or get  us on the train
. 

We all met, the group of children, and we were escorted in the train, and before we 

knew it Œ before I knew what was going on, I was in a train. I had no clue of, really 

and truly, I thought I was going on a trip. 

Q: Did you know it was to 
Holland
? 

A: No.  
Q: Now, the previous times, you mentioned two previous times you tried to go, had 
that been by train, or some other means? 

A: No, that was by car. The Œ the cousin from 
Holland
 had come wit h a car. 
Q: I see. So this was the first train ride Œ the tr Œ first train ride to there, you know, 

to try and get out of Œ 

A: Well, I can™t remem ber ever being on a trai n ever before, but I Œ I mi ght have

Q: And when you said goodbye to your parent s, was it li ke, we™ll  see you after the 
vacation?  

A: Yeah, I think it was. See, I had no understanding of the situation. 

Q: And did you know any of the other kids? Did you recognize anybody?
 
A: The y were from all over, not just from 
Col o
g ne
.  
Q: Tell me, what Œ what happened then? 
A: Well, in the train, I guess I finally realized. Everybody was talking, and we were 

in a compartment with other children. And the next thing I knew, m y sister tells me 

that I was a crybaby. I was very petite, and she was Œ she was very grown, very 

mat ure for her age. And so I said to her whatever, something didn™t please me, and I 

started to cry. And I cri ed and cried and cried. And she said, you better stop crying, 

because not hing™s going to help you, there™s no one here t o help, we™re just the t wo 
of us. And I couldn™t understand t hat, and I said, well, where™s mom and dad. And 
she said no, we™re alone. We™re goi ng on a Œ on a trip. She must have known, I™m 

sure she di d.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: But the next thing we knew, we get to t he border, and t he German government  

comes 
Œ arm y people come in, and the y te Œ at  random, take a suit case, open it up 

and dump i t on the floor, to see what Œ what we have in it. And just before he came

in, I must have had a cryi ng jag. And my sister took one l ook at me, and said, if you 
continue to cry, you™ll Œ they™ll take you and throw you off the train. So you better 

make up your mind to stop crying. I think that ™s the last ti me I cried. So Œ  

Q: Ever?  

A: No. But I was not a crybaby after that. 
Q: Oka y, oka y. 
A: But I was. I was spoiled. So then we Œ next thing we knew, with all  the stuff 

thrown over, all over the floor, whatever, we™re trying to get Œ but m y sister was in 

charge, you know. I was in a corner, or whatever. I must have fallen asleep, and t he 

next thing I knew, we are in 
Holland
, and we are greeted with hot chocolate, and a 

cheese sandwich, by lovely, young nurses, but  we didn™t know the y were nurses. 

Q: Do you know where this was, on the 
Holland
 border, or insi de the coun Œ 
A: In
 
Amsterdam

20 years m y 

senior. And she is speaking to an Israeli, and suddenly the Israeli lady turns to me, 
and she said, I™d like to introduce myself. She says, you™re not very friendly. So I 
looked at her and I said, you were in conversat ion with my friend, and I thought, 

why should I introduce m yself? That wouldn™t have been very nice. And as she said 

those few words to me, I said, but now that I Œ we said hello, are you Dutch? And 

she looks at me, and in perfect English said, are you psychic? And I said Œ she said, 

how would you know I™m Dutch? And I said, you had such gutt ural sounds, it 

reminded me of 
Holland

to tell her. She turned ashen. She was like Œ I said, are you well, and she said, I™m

She said, I™m trying to think of his name. And I said, oh, t hat™s interesting, I said,

a very fussy eater. I ate nothing, until they forced me to. And then I got a letter in 

Holland

Q: Rashes.  
A: Œ the dark rashes and things, until the y got a note from m y mother, at the ti me,

advised them that he could take major belongi ngs, silver, or mone y, or whatever. 
And as everybody else trusted him, so™d my dad, and never saw any of it, not a 
penny™s worth. Never.

lovely home, they were young. The y had two young chil dren, and they had a home 

in 
Amstelveen

gave hi m, i n his backyard. And he had a Œ

A: So, after the war, the Œ the people who owned the home were fleeing themself. 

Their children went to 
England
, and one sta yed in

day of the war.

back to that  home, they could either reclai m their home, or find any other home, 

they went t o another home. Nothing that was ever hidden, was ever found. Zero. 

Q: So your parents had a lot of bad luck in thi s wa y.  
A: The y never thought about Œ yes, they felt it was bad luck, cause financially when 
came to the

happened. So, on our second or thi rd email , I said, with all the work you™re doing, I 
have been thinking about a young man by the name of

Q: Oka y. 
A: My father said, I wil l never step foot in that  country again. The y di dn™t do right 

by me, and the y can keep their reparation. However, when he realized what he had 

missed, because his friends were al l being well taken care of, he deci ded to get in 

contact wit h the attorney who had handled the business deal, who was alive and 
well. I have all o Œ I have a ledger t his big of every correspondence that went on, for 
t
hree years 
Œ  or two ye ars, I™m not sure. I have it all. I just went t hrough it the other 
day, it™s amazing. 

Q: And so what was the end result? 

A: So the attorney kept suggesting m y father come, that without his acknowledging 

all this. And finally, about, I would say, nine months before the end of the period 

where you could clai m, m y father decided t o go to 
Germany
. And b y the time all  
the papers were claimed, he could Œ he nee Œ t he date had expired Œ t h Œ the time for 

that particul ar law Œ there were different laws of personal Œ regardi ng business. And 

the German who bought, fought the case. He fought the case. And so m y father 

never got anything pert aining to business. However, the y did get reparation. Not as 

much as anybody else did. And I have stuff showing what the y got. I think the y Œ I 

Œ I don™t know, I™d have to look it up, I think t hey got something like 500 dollars a 

month, or 300 dol lars a month. Ma ybe was three. I could look that  up, I don™t know.

Q: Oka y, he wouldn™t have come across all of these obstacles. 

A: Under duress, he was not going to do that. So they did, for the rest  of their life, 

did get reparations, yes. Minor. 
Q: But not Œ 
A: The y never got a major sum
, with 
Œ many people did, and then their monthly.  
Q: So the y never got compensated for their business? 

A: Not a penny. I don™t  know why this ot her man got involved, but Œ 

Q: The other man being the one who was fighting it? Or the Œ  

A: Yes.  

Q: Yes.  
A: Yes.  
Q: Yes. Well, ma ybe he wanted to keep the business. He probably just didn™t Œ 

A: I Œ I Œ I don™t know what he said. He only bought it at this special price for

had a point of you, like your dad was, I don™t want to go. 

A: Absolutely. There was no reason why I should go, and I really didn™t want to go. 
Q: And when you did, t hat first ti me with your rabbi, did i t change anyt hing? 
A: It was an interesting trip, because I was t he interpreter of a lot of unpleasantness 

that I overheard, because he was wearing a ya rmulke all t he ti me. And people 

would make

deep, I had t his feeling Œ one little child in one of the schools said, oh my grandpa 
told me something about the terrible Jews. This Œ this li ttle kid in school that I was 
addressing. So, you know, m y feeling w

after the war with my mother, all the ti me. B ut you know, I had young kids, I 
wasn™t interested, or Œ I think I sent Chri stmas cards or something, but nothing on a

bored to tears, cause we spoke German all the time. And it was Œ

A: Œ be yond m y expect ation. 
Q: Did she fill you in on what her l ife had been like, from the time you said 

goodbye to her?

really going on. I didn™t have the burden of all the hardship. I was Œ I was well 
taken care of until 
K ristallnacht
. And I felt my childhood was absolutel y glorious, 

lovely. I mean, I had as lovely a childhood as I wanted my children to have. But we 

Œ we definitely had values in our family. We had religion in our famil y. And I have 

felt very grat eful that Œ we talk about it a lot, especially when the holi days come 
about. Because most of my friends are not so i nclined. And I love to go to services, 
I enjoy it, I Œ something very personal that I get out of it. And I t hink my Œ 
m y 
children are i nvolved, but not to the extent that I am. The y are Œ I al ways feel the y 

do things cause the y know it means a lot t o me. The y do go to services, but not on a 

regular basi s, you know. But that ™s fine. They have their value system, I have mine.

had, cause I was given values that have served me well, and I Œ you learn v
ery early 
on in life, I was very independent, and I™m very particular about friends I choose.

Œ this lady just that call ed, we™re friends 55 ye ars. 

Q: Wow.
 
A: And I have another one in 
Chicago
, it ™s 56 years. So i t™s Œ I think I have been so 

grateful. I™ve had a l ovel y life. I Œ I believe that every person, up t o an extent, I 

realize that, but we have the ability to create a la Œ a lifestyle, no matter what mil ieu
