KRISTINE KEREN 
October 25, 2007 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust  Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Kristine 
Keren, conducted by Amy Rubin, on October 25
th
, 2007. This interview is ma de possible by a 
grant from Carole and Maurice Be
rk. This is tape number one, si
de A. Okay, Dr. Keren, I wanted 
to just start by asking you to tell 
me  please your full name  as it is 
today, as well as your name  at 
birth. 

Answer: My full name  is Kristine Keren. My 
name  at birth, oh, it was Kristina Heger. 
Q: We re there any other name s that you went by, e
ither first name  or last name , during the war 
years?   

A: Is -- after the war, we change -- we m- move
 to Kraków from Lvov and we change our name s 
that it -- to Chyrowski, Kris
tina Chyrowski, because my parents thought that Chyrowski sound 
much more Polish than Heger, and f -- only f-fo
r the safety reason, they change the name  for 
Chyrowski. 

Q: Can you spell that for me? 

A: Is C-h-y-r-o-w-s-k-i. 

Q: And did you have any other nickna
me s?  Your first name , that is. 
A: No, I always was Kristina. Only when we cam
e to United States, at the time that we got our 
citizenship, we change our name  to Keren, a
nd my na me  -- my first name we changed to 
Kristine. 

Q: So now could you tell me  when and where were you born? 

A: I was born in 1935, October 28, in Lvov. At that
 time  the city belonged to Poland, and during 
the -- from ™39 to ™41, the city wa -- were 
under Russian government. Then from ™41 through 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
2 
 
™45, it became  the f -- under l -- German occ
upation. Right now the city, Lvov, it belongs to 
Ukraine, and the name  is Lviv.  
Q: We re you -- were you born in a hospital, or we re you born at home? 

A: I was born in hospital, it was Jewish hospital, a
nd is still ig -- i-i-in existence, the hospital. 

Q: Tell me  a little bit about your parents. What
 are their name s and when were they born? 
A: My father, his name  is Ignatsi Heger, 
and he was born December 8, 1906, in Lvov. And he 
went to s-schools in Lvov. He graduate from 
-- you can say -- at that time they called this 
gymnasium,  and he got a me dal from the Kaiser 
for t -- his unbelievable success i-in high school. 

He was very intelligent and very sma r t ma n. He 
spoke few languages fluen
tly, and he wanted to 
study me dicine, but unfortunately at that time  itwas, for Jews it was forbidden to partici -- study 

me dicine at the university. But he study at th
e university history a
nd philoso -- philosophy, and 
he got Ph.D. in those two subject.  

Q: Wa s that unusual at that time  for 
-- for a Jew to get Ph.D.™s like that? 
A: It was very difficult because of the numerous
 clauses, you know, the -- the medicine he 
couldn™t study. If some body wanted to study law or 
me dicine, they have to leave Poland and l -- 
went, for example, to Czechoslovakia. I-In Pr ague -- they study in Prague, some study in Vienna, 

but in Poland it was forbidden.  

Q: And tell me  also about your -- your mother. 

A: My mother i -- her name  was Pau
lina Pepe Gold. And she was born July 23
rd
, 1909 -- 1909, in 
Lvov, and her family had a textile business i-in L
vov. He -- she went to sc-school, she graduate 
from gymna sia, and she graduate from a -- a s-
school for d -- designers. And -- and h -- she was 
helping her parents in their busin
ess because mo-mostly what they 
were dealing, it was in text iles 
for clothes, and she was very good 
in -- with -- with th
is. And she -- she had 
a -- a sister and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

had a -- a -- two brothers. And a-
after the war only who survive it was my mother and her sister. 
The rest of the fa mily was -- was killed, and the 
same  with my father family. He had the sister 
and the brother, and his sister was killed in th
e ge -- during action in the ghetto in Lvov, and his 
brother, 1941, the -- when the Russian a-army retreated from Lvov east, he -- he joined the 
Russian army, and we never heard from hi m.
 I tried to look through the Re d Cross, but 
unfortunately they don™t have any information about him.  

Q: How did your parents meet? 

A: Oh, my parents meet -- my father was very
 sport oriented. He -- he was playing soccer, 

basketball, ba se -- ba seba ll, and my mother was 
playing volleyball. And he spot her because she 

was very pretty young woma n, and he spot her and this is how they me t.  

Q: So also tell me  if you had any siblings, and 
I think you have a -- had a 
brother, and tell me  
about him and when he was born. 

A: I -- my brother™s name is Pinyo Pa vel Hege
r. He was born May 18, 1939. And he was di -- he 
was younger than me , or -- three and a half year
s. And he really didn™
t remember, you know, too 
much about what happene d because he  -- he was ve ry young, and during the occupation, where 

we -- we were in -- in ghetto, I -- I had to take
 care of him, and we were
 very close. We loved 
this -- ea -- ea -- each othe r, and we will do fo
r -- anything for ea-each other, and you know, the 

circumstances that we grew up, those few years 
during occupation, it ma de such a -- developed 
such a bond between us, that always
 you know, he treat me  like -- not 
only like a sister, but like a 
mother.  

Q: Do you reme mber -- you were quite young, 
but do you reme mber when he was born? 
A: Yes, I reme mber exactly when he was born. 
He was born at home in our -- in my pa rent™s 
bedroom, and I kn -- I knew that some thing will 
happen, because my parents sent me  with our

ma id, it was some  k-kind of Christian holy day. A
nd she took me  and she wanted to go with me  
to -- to -- to -- to park, 
and th -- went  fr-from the park she --
 she went to the -- the chur ch. But I 
was very un -- I was very nervous because I knew 
that some thing is going on, I could feel it, and 
I wanted constantly to go home . I -- I pushed he
r and push her all the time, let™s go home , let™s 
go home . And then finally we got home  a fter fe
w hours walking, we got home  and my  father, hi 
-- he w-when I e-entered the -- th-the apartment,
 my father took me  to the bedroom and show 
me , and said this is your new baby brother. And 
he -- I ask him how it came, and my father said, 
you know, do y -- we put the su-sugar in front 
of the -- on the window 
le-ledge, and the -- 
Q: The stork? 
A: -- the stork came, took the sugar and left your 
brother here. And I was sure that this is the 
story, that the -- this
 is what happened. 
Q: That™s cute. Did you -- do you reme mber 
if there was a bris for your brother? 
A: Yes, I reme mber. It was when the -- a week later it was a bris, it -- it happen in our apartment, 
it was th -- a lot of people came, and they kept me  
still with -- with my aunt in the kitchen, they 
didn™t let me  out from the kitchen and I was crying 
and kicking my aunt that I want to go and see 
because I knew that some thing is going on th
ere. But they -- they didn™t allowed me . 
Q: What are some  of your earliest memories
, you know, before anything really changed, of 
Lvov?  Anything about the city? You were 
quite young, but anything you quite reme mber? 
A: I reme mb er very well th-those years i-in -- 
i-in -- in Lvov. Lvov was b
eautiful city, and th-th-
the streets were always full of people rushing an
d going and I used to go to a -- a -- a -- a ma n -- 
a [indecipherable]. This is a -- a-
a -- si -- si -- place in the mi ddl
e of the city, b
eautiful with two 
m -- lions wa s -- big lions standing and watching th
e market. This was ma in market in the city, 
always bi -- bi -- lot of wome
n ber -- were selling flowers, a
nd I like it about that -- that -- you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
5 
 
know, so ma ny flowers were around. And then th -- 
I reme mber that I used to go every day with 
my nanny, or -- or later with my mother to Viso
kes Zamec. It was a park, beautiful park on the 
hills that you could see the whole Lvov from the ma
 -- high hills. And always l-lot of kids. I used 
to play there, I used to play with my cousins th
ere, and i-it was really such a pleasur e to live in 
this city and I reme mber waiting for my parentswhen they were working at the business, the 
textile business, wa-waiting for them to come out and to go with them home. I was sitting on the 

step and waiting and I had clothe
s -- dresses made by a -- a designer,
 she had a -- a store special -
- s-specially for children d-desi
gning. And m -- I used to go th
ere, I reme mber standing on the 
stool, and she was taking measureme n
ts and I used to turn it to the 
left, to the right and look into 
the mi rror. It was like a princess. It was so -- so
 nice, so beautiful, I wi
ll never forgot the -- the 
coat that I have in the -- in 
the b -- in navy blue, and the sa
me -- I had the -- made ca -- 
Q: A hat, or -- 

A: A hat, yes. The same -- the same color from 
the same mat -- material . I-It was such a nice life 
and s-such a pleasure I took from ever -- ever
ything. You know, my -- my grandmother used to 

go to Vienna, a-and she used to br
ing a -- a lot of materi
als, she used to buy textile fr-from -- i-in 
Vienna, but each time  she went 
she always bring some thing for me , for her granddaughter. And I 

reme mber the toys that I was gett
ing. I-It was so beautiful, and the 
dresses what she used to bring 
to me  is like you know, it happened ye sterda y. I will probably never forget this.  

Q: That™s really nice. So it sounds like your -- 
your fa mily was pretty we ll off. Can you talk a 

little bit more about the 
work that -- that your parents was --
 were doing, and give
 that sense of, 
you know, how your fa mily was doing financially? 

A: You -- my fa mily were well off, and they did fi n -- financially very well. They weren™t very, 

very rich, but they were, you know, the status was -- 
she wa -- they were ve
ry well si-situated. I -

- we -- we had a -- a m - -  a maid and I had a 
nanny, and they had the -- their own business 
because my grandf -- parents -- when my par -- parents got married, th-they gave -- they bought 
for them a place, not far away from their pl ace,
 and they were running their ow-own shop, their 
own business. And my father was helping my -- 
my mother because it was easy fo-for him, she 
needed help. And they both were working there.  

Q: Was it unusual that
 your mother was working at that time? 
A: I -- I really -- y-y -- y-you know, my mother was 
working there, and I t
ook this that this is 
how it™s supposed to be. I don™t kno
w, but I -- I think that it wasn™t
 so popular that wo me n were 
working, but my -- my fa ther c-come s from fa mi
l y who was very socialistic oriented. And my 
mo -- my gr andmother already was working f-for 
o-on the side of my mo ther, my grandmother 
was working in the business. That mean he
r daughter, it wasn™t 
some thing unusual, she 
continued the 
tradition. 
Q: That™s interesting. We re your -- we
re your parents polit
ically involved? 
A: My parents weren™t politically
 i-i-in -- involved, o-only that I 
know that my grandfather, my -
- from my father™s side, he was a Socialist and 
he was with a group of workers. But he wasn™t 
involved with any demo nstra
tion, a-anything like this, no.  
Q: Can you tell me  a little bit more about each of your parents personalities, and also, you know, 

did they run a strict 
household, or what kind of
 home life was it like? 
A: The life that I reme mber before the war, it was-- it wasn™t so s -- you know, s-strict fo-for me , 

bu -- I-I had a nanny that I wa -- she took care of
 -- of me , but you know, it had to -- to be 
discipline. It was certain hour that
 I have a breakfast, dinner, e-etcetera. But -- a-and my father 
was always busy and my  mother was busy too, bu
t is -- when she was comi ng home , sh-she 
spend the time wi-with me. Most 
of the time  she spend with me
 and later on with my brother

together. But th-the atmo sphere at home  wa
s very easy. We ™re s-so delighted, you know -- my 
father has a great sense of hu
mor and my mother too. And ever
ything was always with smile, 
and everything we a -- we always were laughing, 
even if the most difficult circumstances. We  -- 
he always tried to ma ke jokes, and my mother
 too, to ma ke it easy to -- to go through those 
things.  
Q: So, could you also give me  a sort of a phys
ical description of -- 
of your home ?  You know, 
describe what 
it looked like. 

A: Oh, we used to live on the Kopernica 12, in L
vov. This wa -- is a beautif
ul building and is still 
standing, and is even included in
 the hi-historical artifacts. 
Q: As a landma rk?  

A: Like the landmark. Is a landmark, because I 
found out in the guide of Lvov city, and I found 
out that this building is -- is 
a landmark. Is a beautiful o -- i-it
 -- we live -- the building had a 
front side, and then it has a bit of -- a beautiful
 courtyard, and m -- back 
part. I was born on the 
first floor in the back part, but 
then my parents moved to the bigger apartment in the ma in part, 
the front one, on the third floor, and it was a beauti
ful -- a round thing, like 
spiral s-steps, and the 
ceiling was all with -- ma de with 
glass. And it was bi -- the entr
ance was beautiful, and the same  
the apartment. It was big apartment; when you co
me  in, y -- we have a big hall, and then y -- you 
go to the left. It was the -- like a dining room, a
nd the be -- and the bed -- and the kitchen, and th-
th -- it was a bath there, and it was another bath 
for the guest s a-at the --
 i-in the corridor. You 
had -- the corridor had a 
beautiful window, big window, and th-t
hen w-we have a -- a ma ster 
bedroom for my parents, then it was a bedroom fo
r -- for me, and a th -- a third bedroo m for a -- 
for my brother. And we had a beautiful furnitures,
 and a very good piano that my mot her used to 
play. Nice wi ndows and nice balcony. I-I-It
 was some thing really beautiful. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

Q: What are some  of your fondest 
memories of being in that home ? 
A: Oh, oh, I -- I like it to play i-in
 the courtyard with my friends. 
And I like to play at my home  
too, with my  toys that my grandma u-used to
 bring me . And we had the -- when my bro -- 

brother was born, my father bought a -- a dog that
 we na me  him -- name  him Pooshek because 
his hair was so delicate and so puffy t hat we
 name  him Pooshek. And the -- I-I -- I loved -- I 
loved this --  this apartment, th-t
his house, th-the kids that I used
 to play. I-It was a beautiful life. 
Q: Wa s that apartment building or the ove
rall neighborhood mostly a 
Jewish neighborhood? 
A: It was -- this apartment building bi -- was built in the section -- newest
 section and it wasn™t 
only owned by Jewish people. It wa
s mi x -- mi xture. But the buildi
ng that we live, mo st of the 
tenants were Jewish, only the c
oncierge, he was Christian. 
Q: And so most of the kids you were playing 
with were probably Jewish, you think, or you 

reme mber fr om that time? 

A: I reme mb er that most of the time I used to pl
ay with the daughter of 
the concierge. I like her 
very much, we were similar age. She was older th
an me  ma ybe a year or two, and I loved to play 
with her. And there were other kids that we 
played. But my fr iend, she 
was really my friend. 
Q: Do you reme mber her name? 

A: Her name was Danusha.  

Q: And wha t  about within the home? We re you -- 
was your family fairly observant? Were they 
kosher?  Wh at -- describe to me  kind of th
e level of Jewish observance in your home. 
A: In my -- my -- from the [indecipherable] of 
my father, they weren't religion. They kept the 
tradition. The -- the hol
y days, but my father, very seldom th
at h-he went to a temple. On my 
mother™s side, her grandmother was very religio
us. And at her home, her mother kept kosher, 
because the grandmother used to live with them, 
and it -- they kept the kosher home, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
9 
 
were re-religious, and the -- the holy days, y-yo
u know, they had that, the holy days. But in our 
house, it -- it was more like keep
ing th-the Jewish tradition, and to
 temple we used to go only on 
the high holy days. 
Q: And so you didn™t keep kosher at home ? 

A: No, we didn™t keep 
ko-kosher at home , no. 
Q: And wha t  about, do you have me mories of Frid
ay night Shabbat dinners, or any other kind of, 
you know, Passover dinners or anything like this at home? 

A: We  used to go to the grandparents, to -- to 
my mother side , because they were the one who -- 
who kept the -- the 
religion at home.  
Q: Do you think that at that young age you were 
actually aware of being Jewish, and also of 
possibly being different from 
others around you, by any -- you know, by comparison to the larger 
population of Lvov?  

A: I-I -- I don™t think so. Til 1939, I really di dn™
t know ex -- do you know, that I am Jewish. I-I 
was like the other kids, and I didn™
t feel the different. The different
 probably who felt, they were 
my parents. But I don™t reme mber th
e -- that I fe-fe -- personally, that
 I feel the difference, that I 
am -- you -- you know, Jewi -- Jewish and that I am 
different from the other kids. I played with 
them i-i-in the -- in the park, I 
play with a lot of kids and I-I 
never, you know, knew that -- that 
this --  the one is Jewish and th
e other one is not Jewish. It didn
™t ma ke any difference for me .  
Q: So does that also me a n -- did you not e
xperience any anti-Se mitism before the war? 

A: Me personally, being a kid, li
ke I was 13 -- I was four -- four
 and a half, five years old, you 
know, I didn™t experience any di-differe
nt -- an -- any an-anti-Se mitism.  
Q: What languages did you speak at home? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
10 
 
A: We  -- we spoke at home  Polish, and some ti
mes when my parents didn™t want me  to 
understand some thing, they -- they
 spoke Yiddish or German. 
But the language spoken was 
Polish.  
Q: So it sounds like your fa mily was fairly well assimilated.  

A: Yeah, we belong to the -- th-the families i-in Lvov that were as -- more -- more assimilated, 

and it -- it -- it was a lot of fa milies, and 
special the fa milies who were -- you know, on the 
higher level, lil -- little bi
t. They were more assimilated, they 
spoke Polish, they went to -- to -- 
to school, a po -- a Polish school, an
d they t -- try. They try to be even with not Jewish people, 
but they didn™t succeeds.  

Q: Before the war, were you in any 
kind of schooling at all, in Lvov? 
A: Til th-the war, ™39, no, I wa
s at home . I was br ought at home . I didn™t -- only after ™39, when 
th-the ration came, and they took Lvov and then
 the -- the governme nt
 was like a -- a -- a 
Russian government, and th-they -- the -- the Russi
an [indecipherable], they -- they opened the 
kindergartens and I went -- the first time  I went 
to the kindergarten in ™
39, the end of ™39, ma ybe 
™40, th -- I -- I reme mber the date that I went
 -- went to the kinderg
arten, how I wa -- I was 
crying. I di dn™t want to stay and I reme mber th
e teacher, that she came to me and she introduce 
me to the other kids, and she said that ever ything 
will be okay, she brought a li -- a --  a doll that  I 

will play. But I was still crying, but then next day 
I was crying less, and then I go -- got used to, 
and I like it.  

Q: So now, if you could tell me , I™m going to -- 
all right. If you could te
ll me about what else 
was changing. We ll, first of all, September 1
st
, 1939, did you have any awareness of the start of 
the war in Poland before -- cause I think it™s th
ree weeks later when the Russians take over Lvov, 
did you have any awareness at all? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
11 
 
A: In the -- September 1
st
, 1939, I reme mber I wa -- my -- my fath
er took me  all of his arms, and 
we were looking through the windows, and I -- 
I reme mber the -- the German airplanes, the 
Messerschmitt, and I reme mber the noise, and my fa
ther was looking and s -- he said to me that 
the -- this is the end. And th-this I reme mber, and 
we were staying in the 
shelter that was in the 
baseme nt in our apart -- in our building, and my
 brother was only li-litt
le, he -- he -- the few 
months and he was i-in the strolle
r, and I reme mb er when they had the -- the pause between the -
- the -- the bo mbing, that I used to go to Danus
ha, to her house, because she was on the fir-fir -- 

ground floor. And this I re -- her mother ma de lunch for her and she ma de  lunch for me, and she 

ma de the eggs upside down. And from this time Ireme mber the taste even, those eggs. But later 

on -- few days later we moved to my grandparent
s shelter because it was bigger. And we stayed 
with ou-our grandparents til the Russian came. 

Q: How long then was -- were you in shelters
 like that? How long was 
the bombing?  You know, 
how long was that going on? 
A: The bombing was going a -- weeks. I think ma ybe 
two or three weeks. And the -- til the -- the 
Russian came. Then i -- then it stopped.  
Q: So now what do you reme mber about that tran
sition, about when the Russians actually came  
in? 

A: When the Russian came -- came in, it was ch
ange in my life because I -- first I went  to 
kindergar ten for the first -- first time. And then
 my -- my parents lost the business, and I 
reme mber the -- the -- the evening that my fa --

Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape number one, side 
B. If you could continue where we got cut off. 
A: A-A-Af - -  one evening after 
the -- the Russian came to -- to 
Lvov and occupied the -- this -- 
the city, my father came at evening home  and he 
said to my mother that right now we don™t have 
anything. That wha-wha-what happened, the Russia
n, they took the whole business, they took -- 
came to the sto-st ore and they told my father to gi
ve him the key, and they sa -- t-told him to -- to 
-- to -- to leave th-the business. And th-this 
is wh-wh-what happened. 
We -- we -- they -- my 
parent, they have a few employees
 that were wor-working for -- for -- for them. They -- the -- 
some  of them went home, some  of them stayed
 and worked for the Russian government. And th-
this was a big shock for -- for my fa mily. We  -- we
 lost our en -- en -- 
and a -- nanny and we lost 
our ma id because our ma id said that now everybody 
is equal she doesn™t have to work for -- for 
rich people. And i-i-it was a -- a completely --  co
mpletely change in our life. My mot her stayed 
at home, my  father started to look for -- for j -- 
some  kind of j ob that we can survive, and t-to -- 
to survive he  needed like  two jobs because the salary were so low, that fr om one job you -- you 

couldn™t, you know, e-e-exist. I don™
t mean t-to -- to any luxury, but it was the simple food was 
very difficult to get. You had to stay in line a
nd you had to had some  type of connection that you 
can get a -- a loaf of bro 
-- o-of -- of bread, o-of 
a little bit of butter. It
 was very difficult, and 
besides it was politically difficult too, because y
ou know -- I didn™t feel this ma ybe so much, but 
I reme mber that my parent were very scared a
nd afraid because they belonged to -- to bourgeois 

and bourgeois sh-should be in Siberia, not in --
 i-in Lvov. And besides t
oo -- t -- our apartment, 
we got two tenants. They came from a side 
of Poland that was under the Ge rman occupation. 
They -- they were the Jewish refu -- refugee to
 came  from Kraków, from other cities, and my 
parents took to -- to th
ey apartment a -- a -- wa -- one room was fo-for a -- a woma n, a -- one

woman, I reme mber her name, she was -- her name
 was Bagnerova. And th
e other room for -- i-
it was for a father and a son that esca-escape from
 Kraków or some  other city. And this way we 
had only wa-- wa -- one bedroom and -- and the k
itchen and the -- the kitchen was for th-the -- 
the -- the tenants -- th-the -- the 
refugee, they could use th-the 
kitchen, th-they used to cook, and 
they used the -- the bathroom
, it was common for all of us. 
Q: Was that something that -- that you did to --
 your fa mily did to take them in because they 
were refugees, or was this some how require
d by the Russians to -- to live like this? 
A: It was both. I-It was -- Russian didn™t like 
that you have t-too ma ny r
ooms, the fa-fa mily, and 
besides, it wa s y -- they wanted to
 -- to help those refugees who 
really didn™t have a place where 
to -- where to live. 
Q: So do you -- do you reme mber this as a pretty di
fficult time, or what are your personal kind of 
recollections from this particular era? 

A: If -- if you take that e -- we will co-co-compare 
the life that I™ve had before and the life that I 
have after ™39, it was different. It
 was more difficult, it was mo
re tension, because my parents 
were always very tense, and were always, you know
, a -- a -- l-l-l-lookin
g outside with -- they 
were afraid. It was comp letely di
fferent . It  was for me, for a chi l d 
it wasn™t so bad that for them, 
but I coul d f- feel th-the tension that was going 
on in the family. And f- for me, I was still pl aying 
with the kids, I -- I was going to 
the kindergar ten. Thi-This time 
I -- I had a m -- my mother in 
home , and from this point of view I was very happy. 

Q: Did you have any awareness at th
is -- at this earlier stage about 
the Nazis, before they actually 
came in, did you have any awareness as a young child? 

A: I didn™t know anything about th
e Nazi til the -- in 1941 the -- wh
en they ma rch to the city of 
Lvov. Nothing. It was -- probably my -- my parents,
 they ba -- they s-
spoke with the refugee 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
14 
 
[indecipherable] but I -- I, like a child, I didn™
t pay too much attenti
on to this. I didn™t know 
anything about the Nazi before.  
Q: So now tell me  what are your earliest first 
me mories about the Nazis taking over Lvov, and -- 
and when is this, and -- and give me  a 
sense of how old you are about this time. 
A: It was in June, 1941. This -- I -- I was al-alr
eady six years old, and I reme mber this vividly 

because it was the same first -- it was th-the -- 
the -- the airplane and the bombing, and we went 
to the shel-shelter, and I was watching thr
ough the -- through the window 
the same similar like 
™39, but i-it -- this time it was -- my -- my pare
nts were co-completely 
de-depressed and th-th -- 
my father said th-th-th -- I reme mber to me , he -- 
we-we had bad, but this -- this is worse, what is 
-- was comi ng. And it -- it really 
was like this. The -- he -- I -- I reme mb er hear the screaming 
and yelling and th-th-the Germans, the -- the --
 on the motorcycles are roaring through the -- 
through this street, a-and the Ukra
inians who -- who were so glad
 that the German came. They 
were happy, the wome n, Ukrainian wome n wer e  th
i -- giving flowers to -- t-to the Germans, 
because the Germans pr omised them that they w
ill have the independent Ukraine now. This is 
why they were so -- so happy. And the one who 
were suffering the most, they were the je -- 

Jews, because Ukrainian hate the Jews before the war, and di d th -- the -- pogroms be fore the 

war, now they had the free hand from the Germ
ans and they did -- did a ver-very good job by k-
killing and beating the Jews.  

Q: So you have -- you have a -- a vivid me mory of
 actually seeing Nazis on 
the sort of day that 
they come in?  Tell me a little bit 
more about what you actually saw, and this is from your -- from 
your home, right? 

A: I saw this from my home, 
from the window. I saw the Nazi 
comi ng, riding the bicycles, and I 
saw th-the -- the Germans pa-parading, and th
en th-the Ukrainians 
joining them, and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
15 
 
commotion what happened o-on the street, I saw 
th -- everything I saw through the window, and 
I reme mber vividly. 
Q: Do you -- did you see violent thi
ngs right in front of you from th
e window from t he start, or -- 
or was -- you didn't see that directly from there? 

A: No, from the window I could see, I could se
e how the Ukrainian were hitting the -- th-the 
Jewish people. The -- th-the German didn™t got invol
ved so much, they -- they left th-the -- th-the 
bad work to the Ukrainians. And they took advantag
e of this and they really ber -- th-they were 
terrible, they were worse than Germans. 

Q: An-And how scared did this ma ke you f
eel as a six year old at that time? 
A: Yeah, I was very scared, and I -- I reme mber that
 from that time  I never went out. I was inside 
the apartment, because my parents, they didn™t 
le-let me go out, even I di dn™t pl ay in our -- our 

backyard. I di -- di -- I didn't go to
 -- to -- thi -- thi -- 
this was the end of my childhood, th-that™s 
it. From this mo me nt I became already a grownup. 
Q: Did you get to see that friend of yours any mo
re from the building, th
e concierge™s daughter? 
A: Yeah, she was the only one that I used to go to
 her and play in her ap
artment with her, yeah. 
She was the only one. 
Q: Did you -- were you aware of, or did you know
 about then the pogroms taking pl ace in the 
imme diate aftermath, you know, after the Nazis came
 in and the Ukrainians, I guess, killed, you 
know, thousands, right? 

A: I-I sa w this and I knew about it, and I -- I ur 
-- my parents didn™t tell 
me straight, but I was 
very observant, and through the window when I 
was looking, I saw lot of things. But, you know, 
they try to keep from us. They didn™t want to 
-- to scare u-us too muc
h, but th-the time was 
terrible because the Germans started to come  al
ready to our apartment 
and they took all our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
16 
 
furnitures, all our belongings. But they took it, I 
reme mber they came and they took th-the piano 
and th-the -- the German, he -- he came  and he s a
w the piano and he started to play, he played 
very well, and he liked the piano. And he -- he --
 he send people and they took it. We  -- we were 
sitting on the floor with few belongings
 and that™s it. Everything was gone.  
Q: We re -- were you all still living ther
e, the other tenants with you still? 
A: I -- I-I -- I -- th-th-the German
 used to come, a-and used to take Jewish people from the 
apartments, and one night, on the second fr -- on 
th-the same  fl -- no, it was on the second floor, 
they came and they took the owner of the -- of 
the building, it was a Jewish ma n, and they took 
the -- the owner. And then they 
went to the third fl oor, and they
 went to the ot -- it was a two 
apartment, but they told that this is one apartm
ent, similar that on the second floor. That me an 
they took those people who live on th
e right side and they didn™t come  to our apartment. It was a 
sheer luck that they didn™t take us. But i-it 
was -- they were picking, you know, just comi ng to 
the -- and taking Jews from the apartment, then they
 told us that we have 
to take our things and 
leave the apartment. And we left. We went
 to another pl ace on Zama r St enowska 34, that 
some how my grandfather, he -- he 
said some relative used to live th
ere, and we move d there in -- 
in one room, it was ma ybe 10 - 20 people, and we
 stayed there for -- for a week, and i-it was 
very crowded, terrible, and we m
ove d to another apartment, also on Zama r Stenowska street, but 
it was little bit farther. It was 
number 124, and we stayed there in
 the apartment together. It was 
with one bedroom and one kitchen and we stayed t
ogether with my aunt and two children in the 
same  place, for awhile.  

Q: What was going on with your --
 your father and I don™t know 
if your -- I guess your mother 

wasn™t working when the Russians came , but what 
happened to your father™s work at this stage? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
17 
 
A: During the Russian o-occupation, di -- my fath
er w-work in -- in -- in two places. He -- he 
work one pla -- place, i-it was for a s- spot cleani
ng and he was working there, they hire hi-him 
because hi s friend was a doctor there, and he took my
 father and he said that he is a doctor too, 
and he work there. And it -- it was another pl ace 
that he was working, I think it was with s-some  
kind of supplies. I know that he worked in two places. 
Q: Wa s he able to do that once the Nazis came  in? 

A: No, once the na -- Nazis came in, this was en
d, finito, no work. We  -- we -- we -- h-he -- he 
didn't work, he -- he found ma ybe so-somethi
ng, you know, st-still but this was compl e tely 
different, it wasn™t in the -- in this place, and 
h-he  had to, you know, find some thing to -- to 
supply us with -- with the basic th-things to 
eat. And I -- I don™t know
 exactly where he was 
working because it was a short time , th-then -- 
then we moved to Zama r Stenowska, then we 
move in another pl ace, and he was working, he wa s working like a carpenter when we leave, 

because this already was ghetto. They move -- fr
om Kopernica we went to Zama r Stenowska, it 
was ghetto, but i-it was open and they
 didn™t had -- had the fence yet.
 And th-th- they -- th-the -- 
the Germans, e-every few months they were cu
tting from the space from -- from the ghetto, and 
the Jews had to move to different place. And 
-- and we move  a few times, we -- we move from 
one place to another, be cause the ghetto was getti
ng smaller and smaller, and at a certain time , I 
think it was in -- in ™42, m- ma
ybe that i-i-it -- it came mu- m uc
h smaller and it became cal-call-
called Julak.  

Q: So you™re saying those times that you moved, 
that was actually because the Nazis, the 
Germans we re saying to your fa mily, you have to
 get into the ghetto 
now, you have to keep 

moving.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
18 
 
A: [indecipherable] exactly, they were -- yes. Th-Th-They were moving all over us, you know, 
you had to -- to take it -- each time  you have 
to take less things with -- with you, only what you 
have o-on you a-a-and -- a-and move to a diffe
rent place, and it was very crowded, people was 
living for few fa mily in the same apartment, beca
use it -- it was getting -- 
th-they wa nted to have 
Jews as m -- as much concentrated in one pl
ace that it will be much easier to kill them. 
Q: What were some  of t he items if -- if you c
ould only take a few things each time , were there 
any like favorite items you reme mbe r  as a child 
that you just had to hol
d onto and take with you 
each time? 

A: I -- th -- a -- the -- basically, i-it -- it was a 
-- ma  -- my mother used to take always some thing 
for -- for my  brother to -- to -- to -- to eat li
ke milk, or some thing, and whatever we were 
wearing, but wherever I went for pl
a -- to pl ace, I had one things th
at I wanted to wear, it was my 
sweater that my grandmother knitt
ed for me  before the war. And 
I cherish this sweater, I -- I 
don™t know wh-wha -- what was, you know, what were
 my feelings that I 
g-get so attached to 
this sweater that I was always 
wer -- wearing, trying -- whatever 
it -- w-we move, I -- I -- I took 
the sweater with me. 

Q: And that, of course, is a sweater that you -- 
explain what -- what happe
ned with that sweater, 
just fast-forward for one mo me nt. 

A: Yeah, th-th-th -- the sweater, 
i-i-i -- was saved, together with
 me  -- me . It went through the 
ghetto, through the sewer, and then it went with
 me to -- from L -- from Lvov to Kraków, from 
Kraków to Israel, and from Israel
 it went with me to United Stat
es, and lastly I donated this to 
the -- to the Washington -- the 
Jewish Holocaust Museum, and 
is there on the exhibition.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

Q: What were some of t he other -- I guess, c
ould you explain -- the times that you were moving 
from place to place, and the places where you li
ve d, were there these round-ups going on?  I 
guess, actions? 
A: Oh, the aksia? 

Q: Yeah, if you can explain more about that. 

A: Oh, the -- the -- the aktion, th
ey call these aksia, and th-this 
was a -- a plan fr-from a German 
and the Ukrainian to t-t-take th-the Jews, as ma
ny they could for yu -- or con -- or kill them on 
the spot, or  take them -- around Lvov it was a place called Piaski where they killed them, or they 

took them to the concentration camps. They used 
to come  with the lorries and pack the lorries 
wi-with --  with the Jewish people in the terr ible, 
terribl e con -- circumstances that -- that they 
were hitting them and killing them on the way to --
 on the way to the lorries, and it was plan of -- 
o-of the Germans. It was few actions. It was -- 
one I reme mber was terr ible, it was when we live 
on Zama r St enowska 124, that it wa -- they call th
is August aktion. It was a few days, I think 
from the beginning of the August, like -- like a 
-- the whole -- the whole week. And they were 
going from apartment to apartment, whoever were 
-- was in apartment, ta -- ta-t aking the people 
out, and kill them on the spot, or -- or send them
 i-in for th-the concentration camp or other 
place, t -- t-to killed on the wa
y to concentration camp. And it -- 
it was a -- the terrible -- the 
Jews w-were divided in -- i-in 
the ghetto for two -- t-two group 
of people, the people who work 
during the day, and the people who were workingduring the night. And th
-th -- they used to 
work in the Janowska camp. It was a labor camp 
that the people were working for the German 
company. M y mother was working there, and she 
was sewing the -- the uniforms for th-th -- for 
the Germans. The people who were working duri
ng the day, they had the letter R. The people 
who were working during the night had the letter 
W. And, for example, in the aktion in th -- in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
20 
 
August, e -- o -- everyb-body who had the letter R, 
had to be taken out an
d killed. And n-n-next 
time, in the other aktion, it h-
happened that the people who were
 wearing W stay, and the R -- o-
opposite -- th-the W, th-they were supposed to be
 -- be taken out a-and killed. And this was 

going on every -- every di -- f-fe
w weeks or few months, sometimes. You never knew the -- th-
that will h-happen. It was a -- one 
aktion that they did th- the -- 
to ki ll the -- a-all childr en. 
Wherever they found a kid, they kill him and is --
 on the spot [indecipherable] or th-the  kid was 
small, they took them by the legs and hitting w
ith h-his head th-the --
 the building wall, and -- 
and throwing on the -- on the lorr
y. I-I-I -- it -- all the time w-we have to hi de. And a-all the time 
my father used to build so me  hiding places for us
. And he -- he  had such a -- a -- an -- he was 
such entrepreneur, and he had a really genius wh
en he was finding places, and built for -- for us 
to hide. One of the place that I reme mber, it wa
s a -- a under the window ledge. He -- he -- in 
Europe they build thi-this way, that the wi
ndow, under the window ledge you -- you have a space 
be-between the -- the bricks. And he put a -- a --
 a artificial wall and he camouflaged the wall, 
and it was a space maybe to -- widt h, it was maybe
 one foot, and ma ybe length it was like four 
feet. And we were sitting there 
with my brother on the potties, he
 -- he gave us two potties in 
case we have to go. We  were sitting there and he
 ca -- ca -- bent completely, like you know, like 
he -- the babies i-in the mo- mothe
r™s womb -- womb, and h-he used to
 lock us there, and then put 
a table in front o-of this. And we
 were sitting there, a-and waiti
ng til he will come  back and he 
will fr ee us fr om there. I -- I reme mb er that  this
 was the wor -- this was the -- the worst time for 
me . I was so scared, and I used to cry and I -- my
 brother used to cry and we were holding hands, 
and -- but we  were cry -- crying -- only the 
tears were -- were pouri
ng through our cheeks. We  
were -- they were silent tears. 
And -- because we were afraid th
at some body can hear it that we 
are crying. And I used to always tell my brothe
r, it will be okay, it wi
ll be okay, don™t worry. At 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
21 
 
least my brother had me, that I could tell hi
m d-don™t worry, but I didn
™t have anybody who was 
holding me  and saying don™t -- don™t worry at that 
time. And th -- this is
 the -- during the whole 
war, I think that this was the -- one of the wors
t thing that I we nt thr
ough, hiding in -- in those 
places and waiting for my father to co
me  and to free us fr-from this.  
Q: We ll, were you -- were you very aware at that
 time of people being killed, and what was 
happening after these round-ups? 
A: At that time  that we star
ted to live in ghetto, I was ev -- 
aware of everything what™s going on. 
I saw people killed, I saw people murdered. 
I saw people be -- be y-you know, hitting by the 
Germans, by the Ukrainians, and i-i-i -- o -- o 
-- on this place that we live in Zama r Stenowska 
124, once I went to the -- we had the -- like a ba 
-- small backyard there, and I went there and I 
h-heard some  kind of noise, si -- so-some noise
 that -- like s-s-some -- [t ape interruption] 
Q: Okay. 

A: Like I s -- I said when we were living in Za
mar Stenowska, and the -- 
I -- I was o-outside for -
- for awhile i-in the backyard and I heard -- i-
it wa s a fence backyard, and I heard some  like a g -
- cries, a-and the voices of -- o-of people, and 
the sounds of hitting a
nd I looked through the hole 
in -- i-in the fence, and I saw 
like th-three or four Ukrainian b
oys hitting like with baseballs, 
hitting --  it --  it -- it wasn™t baseball, but someth
ing si-similar, and they were hitting a Jewish 
ma n and he was crying and asking for them to st
op, and I couldn™t do anything. I run upstairs to 
my mother and I said what™s 
going on, she said, you can™t do
 anything. We -- we cannot -- you 
shouldn™t even be outside. It -- I-I saw so ma ny thi
ngs that I have those pi
ctures always with me  
and they are comi ng suddenly, that I even expect to
 -- to see like a f-flashbacks f -- in -- in my 
me mories. Sometimes I have, during the dreams th
at I have, I see th-th-tho -- tho-those faces, 
tho-tho -- I hear those voices. I-It
 was -- it was terribl e for a kid my 
age to see so terrible things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
22 
 
happen to -- to other people. But I wa sn™t a ch
ild any more, I was already a grownup. I had a -- I 
was more like a -- a animal, I have those instinct
s, that I knew that I ha
ve to hide, that I knew 
that I have to run and this is probabl y what sa
ved ma -- my life, because one of the aktion I was 
with my cousin, and I saw the German comi ng, I 
said to her, run, and we were both running. I 
was the faster one and I hide, she didn™t and she was taken. And she -- she was taken and to the 
concentration camp a-a-and -- and killed. It™s -- a
nd I-I knew how to make a di-di-di ff -- how to 
differentiate -- to ma ke a difference between foot
steps. I kn -- I could r
ecognize the footsteps of 
the German a-and not Ge rmans. And I knew w-when I have to hide when I was left alone 

because most of the time I was alone, my mother
 was working in the Ja nowska labor camp, my 
father was working like a carpe
nter in the ghetto, and I was le
ft alone with my brother. S-
Sometimes I -- when I heard the -- 
the footsteps and I knew that they
 are Germans, I -- I grab my 
brother and I put him to a suit
case that -- I push -- close the 
suitcase and I push under the -- th-
the bed, and I by myself was hiding in the corner 
of the room behind my mother robe -- a night 
robe that was ha-ha -- it -- it 
-- he -- he was til the floor, I kn
ew that I can maybe hide there -- 
there, but I made sure that my feet will be back, that the German couldn™t see maybe in my -- my 

feet standing out from t he end of the -- of -- of the robe. And when the German left, th-they -- 

they went usually, they checked every -- they chec
ked and they didn™t see the kids, they left and I 
was waiting a few -- another few seconds to ma ke su
re that they are not comi ng back and then I 
run to open the suitcase and let my brother out be
cause I was afraid that  he will suffocate. This 
was one of my hiding places that I foun -- found. 

Q: How long would that last, or how long woul
d your brother be in a suitcase like that? 
A: It would take few mi nutes
, because you know that they w
ould -- th -- the doors -- you were 
not allowed to lock the doors. Th
e lo -- the doors had to be open
 in -- in the ghetto. They could 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
23 
 
come , I re member that, that they opened the door, 
and they do -- went inside and they started to 
check, you know, they didn™t check the suitcase no
w and they didn™t chec
k with -- luckily be-
behind my mother robe. And -- and they -- it to
ok few -- few mi nutes, maybe two, three mi nutes, 
but I was scared already, I knew I was so j -- th
at I -- he won™t have enough oxygen -- a-air to 
breathe, that I have to o-open the suitcase. 
Q: Wa s your brother terrified?  He was younger an
d probably didn™t understand or know as much 
of what was happening? 

A: He was such a good child. He knew that --

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape number two, side 
A. You were telling me  about your brother. 
A: Yeah, my brother, he -- he 
knew that he -- he 
cannot cry, and he -- he
 was li -- li-like -- 
probably like animal like me t
oo, you -- you know?  He -- he knew 
that I -- if I am saying you 
have to go to the suitcase, he -- he never th-th 
-- questioned this. He -- he -- he knew that I am 
trying to -- to save his life. He was aw-aware
 of everything what™s going on. He was little boy, 
he was four years old, but he kne
w what™s go -- going on exactly.  
Q: So, were there other children 
that you were aware of or even 
learned about after the fact, who 
were doing -- you know, hi-hiding like this and su
rviving like this?  Were 
-- were they actually 
looking for children during th
ese round-ups, or what were these round-ups about? 
A: Most of the -- the round-ups, they were alwa
ys looking for children, because I reme mber that 
my father didn™t let me  go out. He said -- and I 
was only in this room, I 
didn™t go out -- outside. I 
-- we live in -- i-in the --  w-we the -- we move
d fr om -- from the Z-Zamar Stenowska. We -- we 
then -- we live for awhile with my grandfather an
d then we move to another place, and then we 
wind up i-in the building, the -- the Wehr macht 
was on the ground floor and we live on the first 
floor -- floor. I -- I -- I think, and 
I know that some kids were li
ving in this building because I 
reme mber wa -- one -- one day it was a -- a aktion, 
that a -- a round-up for the kids. My father, he 
h-hid us, but other ki ds weren™t so lucky, and 
they will -- taken out bow
 th -- by the Germans. 
And I reme mber when th-the -- the mothers, when
 they came back and they ran to the apartments 
and they didn't  see the kids, they were -- they 
were calling the kids, and 
the -- the kids weren™t 
there, and some the -- of them, commit suicide,
 jumping from the second floor. And I reme mber 
-- I-I -- I reme mber the sound on the falling bodies
 and I ask my mother, what™s the ca -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
25 
 
sound, and she didn™t want to tell me , she said
 no, I di-di-di -- don™
t look, don™t look. But I 
looked and I saw it. And this wa -- the mother
 th-that came  and didn™t find th-the -- their 
children, and they commit suicide. 
This is how I know that there mu
st be more children living in 
-- in this -- the building that we lived.  
Q: So, at what point, and -- and was it -- was it 
a -- a real change for you when the ghetto was 
then sealed in or fenced in and -- and what ar
e your recollections around 
that particular time? 
A: I-I-I -- for me  it wasn™t s-such a b- big change  
because I-I -- I -- I was inside all the time right 
now for -- for awhile already. And I knew I have 
to hide, and I knew that from time to time my 
father was hiding in -- as -- there. Then once he 
-- he built a -- a bunker i-
i-in the baseme nt of 
this building and h-he -- he hid us there and then the German found out about the pl ace because 

some body t old him that my father is hi-hi-hidd
ing th-the -- the kids, 
the family, because my 
mother was there too. And th-th-they
 started to -- to rip the -- th
e wall that my f-father b-built, 
and we -- we came out and th-they started to hi-h
it us and then my father s-started to beg the 
Germans t-to leave us alive, and th-th-they di d, a
nd they ask him who build this, he said that he 
built it, they ask him why you build 
it. Because I want to save my
 fa mily, those are my  children 
and my wife , and they started to hit him a
nd I reme mber that the -- like the blood was dr-
dripping from my father face and my f-father he
ad. A-A-And then my -- my mother, she had the 
watch, and she -- she gave this to the Germans. Sh
e -- she tried to bribe them, and th-th -- th-then 
h-he said, th-the one of the German, oh-oh -- oka
y. Th -- one kids can st ay, one kids will go and 
he -- they told my mother and my father to 
choose which one will stay, which one will go. And 
my father took from his pocket picture of me  and 
my brother together, and he said, those are my 
two kids. I can™t make the different, who will go 
and wh-who will stay. Please let them s -- both -
- both of them stay. And s-some
how I-I think that my father 
gave it to him his watch, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
26 
 
some how he said, okay, [speaks German here] he 
said, in German. And we -- we stayed there, 
but we were afraid if we will go upstairs to our apartment that  the ot her German will come or the 
Ukrainians will come  and they will take us. And my
 mother s-sa --  ask him to go with us to the 
apartment. He went with us to the apartment a
nd he stayed and he -- my mother ask him if he 
wants some thing to eat, if he -- h-he -- he wants ei
er with -- he said eier with zwiebeln, eggs and 
onions. And my mother made for 
him tho-those eggs. She started, 
you know, t-to say -- to keep 
him busy, to stay as long as -- as he can. And th-thi
s way we -- we -- we stay alive. It was a pure, 
pure luck. I -- I -- I can™t 
-- I-I -- I -- I don™t know 
ho-how to explain this, that so ma ny thousands 
went and we stayed. 

Q: Do you think it -- it ma de a big difference, it he
lped that -- that your fa mily did have some  of 
the financial resources from -- from the earlier da
ys?  These kinds of incidents, do you think that 
helped a gr eat deal? 

A: An -- absolutely. If you had -- at that time  it was very important to ma ke some  jewelry, some  
valuable things to -- to br ibe the Germans, to 
bribe the Ukrainians, because th-th -- even if the 
German lets you go, the Ukrainian didn™t. And th-t
h-this was a ma in commodity at that time . 
Another ca -- ta -- commodity that 
was very valuable in that time, it 
was the cyanide. It -- it -- th-
th-this is the toxin, you know, that
 y-you take to commit su-suicide. 
Q: Oh, cyanide? 

A: Cyanide, cyanide, yes. And my
 mother, she always have with 
her, three vials, small, t-tiny 
vials, one for her and one fo-for each of her child
 because she said that 
the German will -- will 
not take us alive. And my fath
er, probably he had one too.  
Q: Did you know that she had that at the time ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
27 
 
A: I didn™t know. I di -- I 
-- I only find out wa -- once, when one of
 the fi -- fi -- fi-fi -- th-that -- 
that I-I fi-figured it out once when one of the vial
 -- ma -- my mother broke and th-then I figure it 
out that  sh-she has it. But this was her -- she always said that she -- the German will not get us 
alive.  

Q: At that age did you think much a bout death?
 As in your own possible death at that time? 
A: I was alwa ys, you know, afraid of death. This is
 why I developed this 
instinct and knowledge 
how to hide myself, and to hide my brother because
 I was scared. I was scared that I will be dead 

-- that  I will die. And I was scared that  my pare
nts will die and I will st ay al one, and then I will 
die. It was -- it was the whole process th
at was going in -- in
 -- in my head.  
Q: So I™m not sure if -- if there™
s a -- a difference, or if you want 
to just talk about what kind of 
work your father was still able to do, and wa
s there a difference between when the ghetto was 

not yet sealed and when it was sealed? 

A: It --  i-i-it was -- he was a cam -- a carpent er, he was responsible for --  for all the repairs i-i-in 
the ghetto and for the commander of the ghetto. If so
me thing -- if he wanted to build some thing, 
want to ma ke some thing, he -- he -- he build the 
apartment for -- for himself, it -- my father was 
responsible for -- for this. Yeah, it was a terrible
 job because he was dealing with a crazy person, 
sadist, who was very happy and he fulfilled with ha
ppiness when he could ki
ll -- kill the -- the 
Jews, and he was looking always to -- for to -- to 
do some thing, to -- to cause that my father, that 
he can kill my father. But unfortunately for him,
 and fortunately my fathe r , he -- my father 
oversma rt him.  
Q: So it didn't  mean that he -- that this person trus
ted your fa ther at all, he
 just used him for -- for 
his skills, I guess.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
28 
 
A: Oh, he didn™t tr-trust at all 
my fat her. He -- he used him, he used my father knowledge, my 
father intelligent and smart that my father w-wa
s, and he was giving him each time different sh -- 
chores to do -- do -- to do that he thought is 
impossible for him to do it, and my father did, and 
he couldn™t understand how, how he ma naged to fulf
ill hi -- his desires, I can say. But he wa -- 
he was a terrible ma n and my father s-suffered a lot. And -- 

Q: What was his name? 

A: Jimi k. He was the commander of the -- he 
was known that the when-enever he came the 
different ghettos, that he was the 
liquidator of the ghetto. And he -- 
Q: And there was a close call, do you reme mber 
when it happened, with your father and him, 
right? 

A: Yeah, my father was bi-buildi
ng fo-for hi m his apartment and he told -- he gave him a -- an -- 
a hour when it has to be finished, 
date and hour when it h-has to be
 f-finished. And my father and 
the -- th-th-the employee there, th-they were painti
ng and they finish on the time, but th-th-the -- 
the -- the paint was still wet, and 
he went with his finger and he 
find out that the -- the paint is 
wet, and he said to my father, come  on. And in th
e ma in platz, he -- he-he-he put like a -- a set -- 
like a footstep and h-he -- he -- 
he took my father and my father 
on hi-hi-hi s way to the -- t-to the 
ma - main ma rket, to the pla -- platz, he -- he 
said s -- some thing -- some body was passing and he 
-- h-he said, tell my fa mi ly to --
 to -- to run. And th-th-this ma n 
came to us and he said to my m-
mother, take your kids and run because you will be 
killed. And we run to the next floor, to the 
second floor, to some body -- to -- to some body w
ho lived there and we were watching through 
the window and my mother was holding my -- my 
brother in her arms and my brother said, 
ﬁMama, Mama , look. They are going to hang some
body.ﬂ Because he -- he saw the rope, and th-
the pantel, you know, that -- th
at you hang people. And -- an
d my -- and ma- ma -- and my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
29 
 
mother said to him, don™t -- don™t watch, and sh-s
he turn him around and he
 didn™t know that th-
the rope was prepared to hang my father. He -- he 
says to my father, ta-ta-take the clothes off, 
everything from the pocket [indecipherable] a-and put
 it, the rope, around the neck of my father, 
and my father was -- he was sure that that™s it, th
is is his last second o-of
 his life. And he looked 
to -- to my father, and h-he was perspiring, you 
know, he was -- he -- he 
probably was half of 
conscious already, and he said to 
-- he looked -- he look, he wait, a
nd then he said to -- to my 
father, go. They took the rope and my father wa
s running like this, he -- he -- he was half 
conscious. And he called my father back and he -- my father said okay, he is playing wi-with me  

a game , you know, cat, the mouse, he will hang me  now.
 But he said to -- to my father, why are 
you running with your pen -- penis out?  Because my
 father didn™t put hi s clothes on. He run like 
this. And this was -- he was 
a sadist. He was a sadist. 
Q: And you saw that? 

A: And I saw this. I was looking through the window 
and I saw this. Yeah, it -- i-it is terrible. 
Q: Once the ghetto was sealed, were you in the sa
me  apart ment then, consistently, or were you 
still moving around? 
A: We still were moving around from place, but th
is was the -- the building, this was the last 
place. From this building we es
caped to the -- to the sewer. 
Q: What™s the address? Do you know the address of that place? 

A: I don™t. I don™t know the address.  

Q: But that was some body else™s apartment at one point that you 
moved into. Is that how that 
worked? 

A: It -- it was a building. I 
-- I think it was like a semi -round bi
 -- building that 
had a t-two or 
three floors, and they had a -- outsi
de in the back it has a -- a c
ourt -- it was a big courtyard, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
30 
 
entrance to the apartments were from the 
back -- i-it was like a balcony is go a-around the 
building, and the entrance to
 the apar-apartme nt was from those 
ba-balconies. This is -- this is 
the type of building that you have
 in Europe, that you have th-the
 -- the bild -- big backyard -- 
how you call it -- and then 
the entrances from the apartments are comi ng fro-from the balconies 
i-in the --  in the back. And they 
used to, when they did the aktion 
they used to keep the people in 
this backyard, behind th-th-th-the
 building. And from there they we
re t-taking the people to the l-
lorries. 
Q: What did you eat during this phase?  What
 were you able to eat and how hungry, you know, 
were you, often? 

A: M-Mostly I reme mbe r  what we were eating, it
 was bread, it was the dark bread, a round loaf 
of bread. Some ti me s my  father gets some  milk 
for -- for my younger brother. Some s oup that my 
mother cook when she came home  fr om work. 
Not -- I don™t reme mber eating any -- a-any meat 
[indecipherable] some times eggs. We had th
e some body from the outside of the ghetto, you 
know, people were smuggling things for -- for mo ne
y, th-th-th-they -- they b-bought things from 

-- from Chri stian who were a-around the ghett
o, that they live around the ghetto, and you can 

sm-s muggle  some ti me s. A-And this is what we at
e. I -- I think that we probably we-were so 
scared that we didn™t feel th
at we are hungry. I don™t reme mber
 feeling hungry there in ghetto 
that I felt I -- I didn™t have 
food, but I was so scared that pr
obably, you know, suppressed the -- 

the -- the hunger.  

Q: During this -- all of this time 
being in the ghetto, were -- was your fami ly able to observe any 
Jewish traditions, any of the holidays in any way? 

A: I -- I don™t remember . We -- we didn™t have 
any -- my mo ther used 
to -- I think sometimes 
used to light Friday night candles. This I reme mb
er she had -- that -- that she did when she had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
31 
 
the candles, th-that sh-she did this, yeah. Otherw
ise, I don™t reme mber when the -- the holy days 
came, you know, the day was -- each day w-w-was a similar to the next day. 
Q: And wha t , if any, specific me mor i es do you have
 of -- of your own interactions with any of 
the Nazis? Did you have any, you know, that you r
ecall during all of these different episodes, 
and -- or were you able to successfully hi
de and not have any real interaction?  

A: I-I-In this building th-t hat we
 live on the ground floor, it wa s We
hrmacht. This is a -- German 
soldiers. They were different 
that the Gestapo and the SS, a
nd they used to come  to our 
apartment and bring some  sugar, some  chocolate.
 Some time s they were hiding in our apartment, 
they ask my mother to hide this because they were stealing from each othe r. Some ti mes they 

were giving us some thing. I reme mb er that one of 
-- of them, he -- whenever h-he came , he used 
to take me  on his -- and I was sitt
ing on his laps, and he was telling 
my mother that he has a girl 
the same age that I am. And he used to leave me
 some  sugar, and -- a-and some  chocolate. And 

once I reme mber th-th- that one of the German of the Wehr macht, he sa-saved my father because 
I reme mber he ran to our apartment and he said 
to my father, run, because the Gestapo is comi ng 
to get you. And my father left a
nd the next second the Gestapo cam
e for my father and his -- they 
didn™t found him.  
Q: Oh, that™s interesting. So they were actua
lly, at least a few of them were some what, you 
know, protective and friendly towards you. 

A: Yes, so-some of the m, I -- 
I think you know, it is -- it was a di
fferent between the Wehr ma cht, 
the soldiers and the Nazi and the 
ges -- Gestapo. This was the differe
nt, they -- they -- they were 
the soldiers, they were doing th-the job that they
 were t-told to do. And some  of the m had the he 
-- humane, you know, fe elings. They have the -- th
e wives, the childrens,and th-th-they were 
different, they -- th-they weren™
t so, so bad like the Nazis. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
32 
 
Q: And as a child did you -- for instance, th
e one I guess you sat on his lap, did you like him?  
Did you feel comfortable, or were you always so
rt of scared of any Ger man at this point? 
A: I-I became to like him. From the beginning I was scared, but he was comi ng a f -- a few times 
and I be-begin to like him. I wasn™t so scared from hi m.  

Q: Do you reme mber his name ?  

A: No, no, no, I don™t reme mber. I reme mber hi-his
 -- how he was built, that he was strong ma n. 
He had the young face, he was blonde, and -- but I don™t reme mber his name .  

Q: I just want to go back for a mo ment cau
se I reme mber reading some thing about your 
grandfather and what happened to him, and I™m not
 sure if that™s on your 
mother™s side, or your 
father™s side.  

A: On my father™s side. 

Q: It™s your -- it is your fa
ther™s father, then, right? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And this is when your
 father ran after him?  
A: Yeah, yeah. This was al -- 
Q: And whe n did this happen? 

A: I think it was ™42. Or -- ™42 or ™43, 
I don™t remember ex -- exactly the year. 
Q: You were in the ghetto, or -- 

A: We  were in the ghetto. We  us
ed to leave -- we move alread
y from Za mar Stenowska, from 
another place, and it was becomi ng smaller and we 
used to live together with my grandparents, i-
in one -- in one room. And one day my grandpa -- fath
er came , and he s a id to my father that -- p-
pack your things a-and run. And my
 father said, what does it m
ean, run?  He didn™t wa nt to go. 
He di -- they were discussing why he has to go and my grandfather said, because tomo rrow 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
33 
 
morning they will come  and they will take you -- 
me , and they will kill me . And my father di dn™t 
want to believe it, but my grandfather force him.
 He -- he said only to me  that I will sing him a 
song, the lul -- lullaby that 
I used to always sing to him, and he  gave -- he took h-his wa tch that 
he had in the pocket, the round one, 
and he gave it to my father and he said that he has to go. My 
father was fighting with him, but the end he -- he
 pushed my father. My mother grab only small 
bottle of milk, grab my brother an-and we run. 
And I reme mb er it was night, and we were going, 
and my mo-mother, she stepped on so-something, she 
fell, and she broke th-t
he -- the milk fo-for 
my brother and my father was very unh-unhappy, he 
said now we will -- won™t have milk to feed 
him. And this was the last  time that I saw my gr
andfather and my grandmother, because the next 
day in the morning, they came, they took them, a nd 
they took them to some place. And my father 
was following them. He  was hiding behind th-t
he trees and following and he was standing 
behind the tree, and he saw when they s-shot
 my -- my grandfather and my grandmother. 
Q: Those were his parents? 
A: Those was hi-his parents, yeah.  
Q: Do you think your father was following them to
 try to save them or do something about the 
situation, or -- he just wanted
 to see what happened, I guess. 
A: I don™t think that my father c
ould s -- could save them, but he wa
nted to see the last mi nute of 
his father. And this is oo -- I th
ink th-this is why he went.  
Q: Did you ever see your father become  truly depr
essed by some thing like this, or did he try to 
stay optimistic for his children? 

A: He -- he came home , he was ve
ry depressed, of course, what he
 saw, but my father, he didn't 
lose the belief that he can save us. His o -- what
ever he di -- the purpose 
o-of his -- him staying 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
34 
 
alive was to save his family, a
nd he constantly was working how 
to do it, how to find the place 
that he can hide us, that he can 
spare us f-f-from being killed.  
Q: So, before we -- I think we™re almost ready to 
start talking about the pl
ans for your fa mily to 
escape, but before that, I just want ed to ask, 
were you aware of deportations taking pl ace from -- 
from the ghetto?  What was your awareness as a ch
ild of -- of these sort
s of things, or where 
people were being taken, or did 
you hear much about -- about that? 
A: I knew on the -- the -- about the de portation 
because I saw this. I saw, you know, people pa-
pa -- be taken by the lorries, or
 I saw -- and taking some place. I 
knew that they are going to be 
killed, but I didn™t know really 
about the concentration camp. I-I
-I -- I knew the place that they 
are killed, but the -- the name concentration cam
p, ma  -- th-the parents 
probably, the grown-ups, 
they talk among themselves, but they didn™t want 
-- they tried to save us no -- you know, not to 
tell us th-the -- the -- the whole trut h. But 
I-I was aware of this because I sa w my gr-gr-
grandmother on the -- the lorry with my cousin, 
and I knew that sh-she -- she was killed. And l-
later on, you know, after the war, I f-found out as
 g -- exactly where she was killed, and --  
Q: Where was she taken? 

A: She was taking to the concentration 
camp, and she was k-killed at that -- 
Q: Do you know which one she was at? 

A: Um, yes, Belzec, to Belzec. This was the -- 
the concentration camp that most of the people 
from Lvov, from the eastern part of -- were 
sent. This was the firs
t -- one of the first 
concentration camps. 

Q: What happened to your other gra
ndparents, your mother™s parents? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

Q: Oh, I didn™t know that. 

A: Yeah, and he got lost in the sewer, and we 
couldn™t find -- h-he got --
 he got out, and he was 
shot outside.  

Q: Which -- which of the grandmothers is
 the one who ma de the sweater for you? 
A: I-I -- my grandparents from my 
father™s side , they were divorce. And the mother of my father, 
she knit the sweater for me . She was one who were
 comi ng to our apartme nt and was sitting wi-
with us on Kopernica, and she was knitting. Sh-S
he was the one. The -- the second wife of my 
grandfather, she was killed toge
ther with my grandfather.  
Q: And wha t  happened to your grandmother, this 
maternal o-of -- of my 
f-father, she was taken 
in th -- one of the aktion together with my 
cousin that I was running, 
and she -- sh-she didn™t 
hide, and she was taken by the -- by th -- by Ge
rmans, and I saw her through the w-window, I 
was peeking, and I saw there on one of the lo
rry and she was holding my grand -- my cousin 
Inga, and I was happy that at least she is with 
her grandm- mother. And my grandmother, she -- 

she probably knew that I am a -- w-watching, be
cause she -- she took her [indecipherable] and 
she ma ke like bye to me , and the German hit her 
with the -- w-with the 
gun, wi-with the end of 
the gun he hit her. This is when -- when I last saw her.  

Q: What was her name , your grandmother? 

A: You know that I don™t reme mber ?   

Q: That™s okay. It™ll come to you. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

Q: Okay, so -- so now just start to walk me
 through the process before you actually [phone 
ringing] -- oh -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape number two, side B. 
So, before we actually talk about the escape, 
can you tell me  what you knew, if anything, about pl
ans to escape, what your father and if your 
mother was involved, what -- what you knew, wh
at was happening and -- and how long before 
you did escape were plans being ma de? 
A: When we  live in ghetto in th-this -- in our
 last apartment, I didn™
t know anything about the 
escape that my father was planning. But I reme mber
 one evening h-he came and he s a id to -- to 
my mother, p-pack the things and dress u -- dress 
us up, that we have to leave. And my mother 
put on me  my green sweater, a-a-and a coat, a
nd she put so many things on -- on me , and I ask 
her, wh-why are you dressing me  so warm?  And 
she said, you know, the place that you will go, 
you need warm dresses. And I was fighting with 
her because she wanted to put boots on my feet, 
a-and I said no, I -- I want sandals. I-It wa
s -- you know, it was June
. And she said no, you 
cannot wear sandals, you have to 
w-wear boots. Then -- which -- sh
-she took us, and my fa -- my 
father took us to an -- in the 
ghetto there were few barracks. In 
-- in one of the barracks -- and we 
went to a baseme nt in this barracks, I reme mb
er th -- that it was so dark, and s-so, you know, 

spooky and -- and we -- we stayed there in this -- 
this place, and even in this place, I reme mber 
that it was a hiding space that my 
father prepare for a -- us to hi de if the German were -- were 
comi ng. It was like a second wall he built, a second 
wall, and we were hiding be-behind thi-this 
wall. And then I-I don -- I reme mber they were se
-se -- they we re going behind this wall, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
37 
 
they were digging some thing and digging and we 
stayed, we didn™t go back to our apartment and 
di -- we stay in this baseme nt, we stayed ther
e maybe two or three weeks, something like this. 
And we -- w -- we couldn™t lay down, we were 
all -- always sitting ther
e  an d  my  mo t h e r  w a s  
holding us, and one night I-I -- I reme mber th-t
hat we were sitting and suddenly, you know, like 
from the ground some fa ce came, sa -- wa -- bi g f
ace with beautiful smile, beautiful teeth, blue 
eyes, comi ng and smiling at -- at us, and I -- y-
you know, we were shoc
ked. Who -- who is it? 
And then my father introduced him who 
he is, and this was Socha. He -- 
Q: What™s his full name? 

A: Leopold Socha. And he came -- he introduced himsel
f and my father said that this is his wife 
and two children, and this is how we me t Socha.
 And then few days later, I reme mber it was a 
big commoti on, people were running
 and screaming and my father 
came and said, that™s it, it™s 
time w-we have to go. And we went to this opening in the floor o-o-of the baseme nt and I saw a 

big hole, dark. And my father sai
d, go there. I said, I can™t, I am not going. And he went and then 
I didn™t want to go, and I think my mother or 
somebody else push me , and he grabbed me  down, 
he grabbed me, and I heard -- the mo ment I went
 there, I ca-came down, I heard this noise of 
falling water. And it was so scare
d, this rushing water 
u -- and the darkness, and the smell. And I 
ask my father, where are we, where are we going? 
He said, don™t worry. Stic
k to me , stick to me , 
don™t -- don™t worry. And then my brother came , a
nd my mother, and this is how we started our 
life in -- in the sewer th-that we went down. 
It was a -- a lot of people, commotion, because 
people what -- were comi ng fr-from th-the ma nhol
es around th-the ghetto. They were comi ng to 
the -- to the sewers. I-I-It was -- it was 
terrible. It was like going to hell.  
Q: How was  your father able to plan for this
?  Do you know now sort of what -- what happened, 
in -- in brief -- you know, even though you didn™t know 
at the time, but how did he plan for this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
38 
 
A: Yeah I -- no-now I -- I know, he 
planned -- we -- he me t with th
e -- like I said that he -- he 
was the carpenter, and responsible, he had th
e crew, people working. One of the crew, it was 
Berestitsky, Jacob. He was a [indecipherable] and a 
religiousma n. And my fa
ther k-k-keep him, 
you know, to -- to work for him, and Berestitsky a
pproached my father and said, ﬁHeger, I know 

that you are building and building those hiding 
pl aces, but you ha -- you -- you will not succeed. 

In the end they will kill you and kill your fa mil
y.ﬂ And they started to think about where you can 

hide, and they came to a plan that i-in the sewe
r. And my father reme mbered the sewer because 
when it was built -- because it wa
s a river, Peltew. And because
 of the stench and the -- you 
know, the hygiene, the -- th-they decided in the 
municipality in the ea
rly 900, they decided, you 
know, that they have to cover this. And they used
 -- my father was little when he was going and 

watching the -- the people who are 
working there. They -- the Italian PO W™ s were building this, 
because it wa s Galicia that™s time, you know, diff
erent politics, different -- and they we re 
building this and my fa-father reme mbered how th
ey built, he -- he -- he reme mber how it look 
like. And they came to a p-plan, you know, that t-
to -- to -- to ma ybe, you know, to find a place. 
And they started to dig, they were digging from 
t his baseme nt, then they came down. When they 

came down, they -- they saw a light from a la mp, 
and th-three people came to them and they ask, 
what are you doing here?  They we
re sewer workers, that they, 
y-you know, k-k-keep control of 
the sewers if everything is norma l -- i-in order 
working, you know, in order.
 They keep the -- the 
maintenance of the sew -- maintenance worker. 
And my father said to him, you -- you know, I™m 
looking for place to hide my fa mily from the Germ
ans. Now he started to laugh, and th-th-they 
were starting to talk, and then he
 -- he sa -- he said he wants 
to do what he did and he look and 
he said, it is not so bad, but y -- w-we can help
 you, but if -- for a pay -- payment. And he 
me ntioned some  a mount of money, it was a big am
ount of money. And my father said to him, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
39 
 
okay, I will bring you tomorrow.
 And when w -- they came to the baseme nt, you know, th-th-
they -- few people were involved in
 this, it was Be restitsky, it was We iss, and some  his friends, 
and Weiss s-said to my father that he is stupid
 that he agreed to pay him s o much money. And 
my father said, what else can I lo
se?  I-I have to try. And next day 
he came back and he gave to -- 
to -- to Socha money, and Socha wanted -- then So
cha came up to the baseme nt, and this is when 
I saw him. And then later on he said when we were
 i-in -- in the sewer si
tting, he said that he 
decided to sa ve us when he saw my mother si
tting with those two children. And he said, I saw 
this pictur e, it looked like a chic
ke n with the hands. And this is 
when I decided that I will sa -- 
try to save you. And -- 
Q: Wa s your -- would you charac
terize your father then as an
 optimist?  You know, y-y -- all 
these terrible things are happeni
ng and then this idea that he 
would give a lot of money to 
some one he barely knows. Do you think you would th
ink of your father th
en as just -- I mean, 
obviously very determined, but do you thi
nk he was generally very optimistic? 
Q: He -- he -- he was optimistic per-person, but 
he was too, very determined, and he didn™t, you 
know, lose the -- the believing that he can save us
. He -- he -- he grab everything what can d -- 
he -- he gr abbed, only to -- to save us. And he 
was person who -- who t -- took risks. Because I -- 

if my father wouldn™t take  risk, we wouldn™t 
be  alive, because it wa
s during the -- you know, the 
ghetto time, it was so many times that he t-took ris
k, and I-I-I -- and he st ay 
alive, that I-I-I-I -- I 
-- I don™t -- some ti me s you know, I™m
 thinking and I don™t know what
 is -- is it, it was a luck?  
Most of the t -- of the ti
me  I think it was luck that -- that 
we are alive. I-I don™t know. My mother 
believe in something else. She believed it -- it wa
s a f -- the omen from -- from a high power that 
we s -- we -- we were chosen to -- to stay av -- 
stay alive. Maybe she is ri -- she was right, I don™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
40 
 
know. But my father was ve -- he  was optimistic
 I can say, because I cannot say that somebody 
who will be, you know, very pessimist and depre
ss, h-he woul d give up mu -- much early.  
Q: Do you have any idea how much m
oney your father wound up paying Socha? 
A: I don™t know how much money he gave him from
 the bi -- when he went down, but it must be 
biv -- a -- a lot of money because wi -- Weiss was 
screaming a lot. That™s why I think it was a lot 
of money. And they -- and they -- 
we -- he agreed to pay him ever
y day, 500 zlotys. 500 zlotys at 
that time, it was probably even 200 dollars each 
time. You know, each day when he came, he -- 
he was buying food for this, and then wa 
-- what™s stay, it was for -- for him. 
Q: And your father was able to save a lot of
 mone y some where without, obviously the Nazis -- 
the Germans finding his resources. 
A: I -- I think so because otherwise how -- howhe would have? I think that one of the hiding 

places that my father built, tha-tha -- I think he
 kept th-the money and he kept the jewelry. 

Because later we -- we pa
id with jewelry, too. 
Q: So now, going back to when you first enter th
e -- the sewers, tell me  just how old are you at 
this stage, and how ma ny other pe
ople are joining you in 
this first rush into the sewers?  And is 
this ri ght about the time when
 the liquidation is happening? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Tell me  what™s going on in the ghetto. 

A: This -- this was, I think e
nd of May, May 30 or beginning o-of
 June, that it was a liquidation 
and this is why the people started 
to run and be run t-to
 -- to th -- to the sewer. And this was in 
1943, the beginning of June 1943, and I was at that 
time , I was like seven and half, yeah, and my 
brother was f-four years old. A
nd a-at that time, and d-during 
this panic, lot of people came 
down. I don™t know if lot of people came  down th
rough our entrance. I think that -- more that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
41 
 
they thought because people find out that this is
 an entrance. But lot of people came from the -- 
from the ma nholes. And th-th-th-then i-it was 
s-s-such a y-y-you know, screaming and yelling 
and th-th-th-th-the falling water, and th-the ec
ho. It-It-It sounded so terribly, and you -- you 
know, the ledge that we were walking, it was ma ybe
 one foot wide, and we had to walk, we had 
to -- with our back to the walls, and slide, 
you know?  But from the beginning when we went 
down, I remember that my father -- I was -- h-he 
was holding me  on his back and my mother was 
holding my brother, and this is 
how we walked. Then I ask him 
constantly where are were going, 
where are we  going, and he -- he co-constantly
 wa -was you know, tell
ing me, don™t worry, don™t 
worry, you will be okay. Wa  -- and we pa -- we had 
to pass on the other side 
o-of the river, and I 
was so scared, there was such a -- a na rrow passa
ge l-like a bridge, small narrow bridge, and I 
was so scared. We  passed to the other side. Some how
 we wind out i-in the 
one of the branches of 
th-th-this sewer, looked like a 
cave. A-And so many rats, a-a-a
nd, you know, the stench, i-i-i-it 
was t -- a-a-and the w-w-w -- webs of the -- the sp
ider webs. Wherever we -- we went we had to 
push the spiderwe-webs aside. It was terrible. And 
we stayed there, i-it was lot of people, I think 
ma ybe some  70 or some thing. Lot of people there, 
a-and then after Socha 
came and sh -- he ju -- 
he took a group only of people because he couldn
™t, you know, support -- 
he took like I think 21 
people, and we went to different
 cave, and we were sitting ther
e for -- for long time, I -- I think 
ma ybe two or three weeks, or ma ybe longer.  

Q: And whe r e is this -- you know
, most of us haven™t obviously
 been in a sewer system, so 
where is the sewage?  You™re sitting in this cave -- 

A: And o-on the -- on the floor, the sewage, it --  you -- you -- and the waste is comi ng on the 

floor of the -- 

Q: Right beside you the whole time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
42 
 
A: Right. Right where you are sitt
ing. This is like a, you know, sewe
rs -- yo-you think that this is 
a big place, that there were -- th-this was a se
w -- no, no, not -- i-it was 
a -- like a pipes. And 
some  of them were very narrow, had like 40 cent
imeters, it™s like three 
feet. And si -- you know, 
the height, or sa -- you-you have to s -- s -- when
 we were trying to get to the -- the bigger one, 
you have to go through the branches of the sma
ll one, you have to crawl on your s -- knee, and 
on your elbows. You have to go miles and miles this way, and th -- you know, in the -- 
everything is -- is flowing, and you 
are i-in, trying to get to the 
destination where you -- you have 
to go. I-It wa s unbelievable. 

Q: We re you complaining as a -- as a young child in 
your first encounters with the actual sewage 

flowing by, were you complaining at all?  Or
 were you aware that this was your, you know, 
possible escape for freedom? 

A: I wasn™t complaining. I -- I -- I was s-scared. 
I was very scared but I 
didn™t complain because 
I -- you know, I believe in my father, and I thought that
 he said I have to go there, that I have to 
go there, no complaints. And we were sitting in 
this one -- space 21 of [indecipherable] we got 
very sick. We  got dysentery, we were very weak, 
we didn™t have water to drink. My father used 
to go miles on his knees and elbows and he was 
keeping a teakettle in hi s teeth and he was 
walking like this, he f-found this place when the 
-- drinking water from a fountain, in the ma in -- 
ma in ma rket in Lvov. Was dripping from the stat
ue, the statue of Neptune. And he found this 
water and he was bringing, and he wa -- the water 
for us, and we have like a -- and he divided th-
this, we divide like th-thr ee quar-quarter of a 
-- a -- of a cup, you know, for th -- each person for 
the whole day. And my parents didn™t drank -- didn™t
 drink, they gave us this water because we 
were s-so sick. And then from this place after -- some  people left because  they coul dn™t take it. 

They said they -- they -- they 
can™t take it, they left. But the 
mome nt, you know, they -- they left 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
43 
 
out sight the -- the sewer, they 
were killed, and from the whole 
group, I think we -- we  -- it was 
like 11 people that we stayed there, and then we were -- discovered where another sewer 
ma intenance worker, he came from the ma nhole 
because the ma nhole wa s leading to the place 

that we were sitting and we had to run from this place. We run from this place and we -- we met 

-- Socha was comi ng to -- with the food and he 
saw us running and he took us to a different 

place. And we changed the places few times because 
it was -- some  of them were so cold and so 
terrible that we couldn™t s-stay
 there. And finally we -- we-w
e wind up in a place that when w-
we crawl in, Socha ask my mother, ﬁ What do you th
ink Mrs. Heger, what do you think about this 
place?ﬂ And my mother said, ﬁOh, Mr. 
Socha, this is a pa lace.ﬂ And this is --  ther e in this palace, 
we stay to the end, to th
e el-el-el-el-liberation. 
Q: Can you describe then what th
at looked like a 
little bit more? 
A: I-I-I-It -- it -- it was a branch 
o-of -- one of the branches o-of 
the sewer, but relatively i-it was 
high because -- we could stand, we children woul
d stand up, but my parents coul dn™t stand up, 
they have to bend. That™s meaning it was probabl
y like five feet high and the width was ma ybe 
five or six feet. And it -- it was a main one and it 
had -- from this main branch it was a -- like L 
sha -- it was like a L shape. It was entrance to 
another compartment that was more or less the 
same  s-size, and th-this is ho-how
 it -- it looked like, but compari
ng to the other places, it really 
looked like a palace.  

Q: And still the sewage is
 flowing by here as well? 
A: This -- this was a side one. 
It didn™t have a sewage flowi
ng. It has only ma nhole that came -- 
that the raining water was comi
ng, but not the -- the sewage wa
-wasn™t there. It was mud -- 
muddy -- lot of [indecipherable] and a lo
t of -- lot of -- no -- rats. And -- 
Q: We re you scared of them?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
44 
 
A: From the  beginning we were sc
ared, but then we played with
 them, like you -- you play with 
the dog, with a cat, we play with 
a -- with the rats. We were wa
tching them, what they are doing. 
They are very smart. Very smart animals. Y
eah, and y-you can get used to th -- everything. 
Q: They didn™t -- they didn™t bite you? 
A: Th-They try, you know, from the beginning and my 
father -- but then they got used to us and 
we got to used to -- to them, they didn't bite us. 
The only thing what they -- they used to bite is 

our food, our bread. And we -- my -- my father and 
the rest of the people, they -- they s-s-stood 
guard -- guards, you know, with the 
sticks and constantly chasing th
-them to -- to save our -- our 
food from them. 

Q: Now you said that this became a group of 11. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Do you reme mber all the name s, or the 
individuals who make up that group of 11? 
A: Y-Yeah. It was a -- a -- a g -- Mrs. We inbe
r -- Weiss. She was the old wo -- woma n. She was 
a mother of Weiss who went with us and he left 
outside because he said he
 cannot take it, and he 
left his mother. And it wa s Helena, and Mondek, a
nd Clara and Mrs. We inberg, and Haskell, and 
my mother my father, my brother and me , I think is 10. [indecipherable] 

Q: Wa s your uncle also with 
you?  Is he one of those? 
A: My uncle escaped to the sewer with us. He -- he
 was with us in the first place that we  stay and 
he w-went to -- to fetch the water, and -- and then
 a -- it -- storm ca me  a nd he -- he -- he drown 
in the sewer. Yeah, he never came back. 

Q: So it was quite a rushing flow? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
45 
 
A: Oh yes. It -- it was very dangerous because 
if you crawl in those pipe s, you with your body is 
almost closing the -- the pipe. And when the wa
ter is comi ng [indecipherable] racing very fast. 
And you -- you don™t have time to escape. 
Q: Did you almost fall at any time ?  

A: I -- I ti -- when we we re craw
ling, I-I -- a few time s I -- I -- I-I fall
 to -- to the water and I get, 
you know, injure with the -- I step
ped on -- on the pin, and the pin 
went through my foot, but I -- 
i-i-it was okay.  

Q: So, what -- what was the routine -- and I 
think there are two othe
rs besides Socha -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- so if you can tell me  about them and what
 was the daily routine with y -- those who were, 
you know, helping you, these -- 
these sewer workers. 
A: Th -- it was three sewe r workers. It was 
Socha, Wr obleski and Kowaliw. Kowaliw wi -- he 
was the m- m- maintenance li -- he was on the head
 of the maintenance group. He -- he stayed 
always on the street. He was a wa -- the watc
h person. He watch for anything suspicious and 
dangerous that can happen. And 
Wr obleski and Socha, they were
 comi ng every day with the f-
food supply. And the food supplies, y-you know, they 
had two hand -- handbags 
in that -- in that 
they had food and then they covered this w
ith the -- the li-like ma
intenance, you know -- 
Q: Tools?  

A: Tools, maintenance tools to -- to cover the 
-- the food in case some body tell them to open th-
the -- the handbag, you know. And it™s -- m- m- mostly 
what -- the food what we have is -- was 
bread. It was some , you know, kasha, this is like a 
grains that we can cook, like barley and es -- 
some ti me  some  -- y -- some  kind of a  -- a -- y-you 
know, of a fat or some thing to -- but in -- n-n-
nothing -- nothing -- mo stly it was bread. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
46 
 
Q: We re you hungry a lot? 
A: We  -- we were -- you know, we were dividing. 
They -- they couldn™t brings too much, but we 
were dividi ng. We ate like three times a day. In the morning it was piece of bread, and at coffee -

- coffee was from chicory, water that looked like 
coffee, and f-for dinner, Weinbergowa used to 
cook a -- a soup, and soup was from barley, sometim
es we had potatoes, and -- and onions, yeah 
onions, he used to bring some  onions , and -- 

Q: Did you ever -- 

A: -- beans, some  beans, fava beans or s-some thing, yeah. 

Q: Did you ever have any meat at
 all while you were down there? 
A: We didn™t have meat at all, but we childre
n we re lucky because when Socha was bringing his 
lunch that his wife ma de for him from the cold cuts
, he used to share with us. He used to give my 
brother part  and me part. And I reme mber it --  I reme mber the tast e of this meat til now. And it 

was so delicious, so good, that I used to keep 
the piece of meat for -- fro-from, you know, the 
cold cuts, and piece of bread, and I wa s given such 
a big bite of a bread, a
nd tiny bite from meat 
that it will stay longer and longe
r as I ca -- as I can. That -- th-t
h -- we were lucky, we -- we got 
some meat, yeah. But th
e rest of the people -- 
Q: Sounds like he had a special affecti
on for you and your brother, would you say? 
A: Yeah, he -- he really, you know, he loved us, us
 children, and he -- he 
had a -- a lot of -- y-y-
you know, he -- for my mother he had a lot of like -- 
Q: Respect? 

A: Respect. Respect for my mother
. He admi re her mo -- my moth
er, and he admi re my father. 
He -- he -- my father for him was like a guide. 
Everything what he was supposed to, he always 
ask my father if this is okay. Even his private things and he -- he always ask my father. He was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
47 
 
very close to my father. And he liked us very mu
ch and we like him too. I di -- I treated him like 
my father. He -- he was -- for me  he was an angel. 
Q: Did he ever show any signs of sort of the anti-Semitism that so ma ny Polish people grew up 

with and, you know, sort of had so systemati
zed, you know, as -- as -- you know, did he ever 
reveal that, even at the same  ti me  that he
 was obviously helping 
you and caring for you? 
A: I don™t think so. I never, you know, heard an
ything, and I don™t think so
 that I never heard 
even later from my parents of
 a -- no, I don™t think so.  
Q: And tell me a little bit about Socha™s backgr o
und because I think it™s 
an interesting story, 
because ma ybe partly his background led to this
 kind of work that he -- you know, this saving 
and rescu --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape number three, side A.
 So we were just talking about Mr. Socha. If 
you could tell me a little bit more about him? 
A: Socha wa-was a v-very interesting person. He
 -- he was -- when he was young, he -- he was 
an orphaned. And he tried to ma ke his living, you 
know, whe n he was a -- a li-little boy and then 
when he was t-t-teen [i ndecipherable] little bit [i ndecipherable] thiefs. He was a -- a- a thief. He 

was starting with small things and getting to --
 to-to bigger one. He had a -- a -- some  
companions who t -- another thiefs that they 
were working with him and he was caught few 
times. I think that he was like three years 
in the -- in the jail. And he was committing 
[indecipherable] robberies, but he 
-- he never killed anybody. It was 
a s -- i-it was probably only 
to -- to survive, he didn™t know anything else
. And he was a very religious ma n. He wa s 
Catholic, very religious and I th
ink it was -- it was unbelievable th
at person like this can change 
so much and save 10 people in such a circumst
ances, in such a conditions. And I was always 

thinking wh-why he did this and I 
think that he wa nted -- he really was very good person, very 

good huma n being, but this was the 
way he -- he was forced to be brought up, and suddenly he -- 

he me t diffe rent people and he was very proud of 
my father because a person like my  father, very 
intelligent, ve ry educated person, trust him, give trust, you know, of his -- him and his fa mily t-to 

hi-his hands. And h-he was very proud of this 
and it changed co mpletely his -- hi-his life. He 
probably felt right now that he is some body, tha t  
he is not a ti -- a piece, you know, of garbage or 
some thing, that people are pu-pushing away. He
 -- he found a -- a friend with people of 
completely different background, and he was very 
proud, and besides he -- I think it -- because 
he was very religion, he wanted
 to pay for his sins, and he 
look a-at th-this like kind of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
49 
 
redemption and this is what I think what -- there 
were the forces that kept him going and save us. 
And he -- he -- he was a great person. For me , I 
-- I loved him and I still loved him, and when I 
say kaddish for my parents, I say kaddish for 
him, too. I-I-It was a -- a gr eat pe rson. A great, 
righteous person, and we always, the10 of us 
who survive and the families of 10 of us, we 

always remember him and his name.  

Q: Wa s he ever name d as a Righteous Among the Nations? 

A: He is. He is name d a Righteous o-of -- th-t
he Nation. He is in Yad Vashem. He has -- he -- 
trees on his name  was planted already like 30 year
s ago there. He is on the permanent exhibition 
in Yad Vashem. This is a new wing, like now, this is for Righteous People, and he is among 

them. He, as a matter of fact, I think that the bigg
est place on the walls is --
 is dedi cated to -- to 
Socha.  

Q: Now how would you characterize the other me
n who we re helping, the other two, I believe 
who were helping Socha?  We re they, you know, as
 devoted, would you say, 
to saving you?  Or -- 
how would you describe them, their motivations? 

A: I -- I would describe them, they were righteo
us people, you know, and 
th-th -- they did this, 
but they were not so devoted, were the -- I can, 
you know, see, like Socha. He was the machine. 
He was the brain o-o- of us because it came a mo
me nt that we didn™t have  any more money and 
my mother was delegated to tell him that we 
don™t have any more money and Socha said, oh, if 
you don™t have n-no mor e  money, then we cannot 
work any more. But he came next day, he 
came like usual and he brought us food. But I know that he said that the -- Wr obleski and 

Kowaliw wanted to st op but he -- he  forced th
em n-no-no-not to -- not to st op and he succeeded. 
He was y-y-yo -- you know, taking his -- his work that
 -- to-to -- to 
the end. He told this is his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

de-destiny and this is what we wanted -- he wa
nted to accomplish and he  did. He was very proud 
of this. 

Q: When did you run -- when did your fa mily 
run out of mo ney?  Do
 you know when that 
happened while you were down there? 

A: I-It was a f-few months before the liberati
on, yeah, that we runned ou-ou-out of money, that 
we didn™t have. 

Q: And -- and prior to that th
ere was actually another story, 
I think, about the gold, or the 
jewelry? 

A: Yeah, it was a-after I think that we stayed ther
e almost a year, only be -- a little bit less. We -- 
we runned out -- ou-out of money, we -- we-we ha
d some  jewelry with us that my father was 
giving him, but we run out of this too. And then
 my father re-reme mbered that his aunt, o-or -- 
told -- told him-- a aunt -- I think aunt, that 
she hid some money in th
e cellar of her apartment 
that she used to live, and th -- sh-she tol-told this to my father, and my father m- made the plan, 
he wrote on piece of pape r, he desi gned the plan
 of the -- the -- he reme mbered th-the -- the 
building and the cellar and he told Socha to go th
ere and ma -maybe he can dig and he can find it. 
And Socha went there together with ro -- Wr obles
ki and they said that they are from sewer 
working, that is some  kind of gas leak or so
me thing, and they we-were digging and they found 
th-the jewelry. And he -- he -- and the next da-d
ay, we ha -- I reme mber Socha came, and he -- 
he -- he -- he had the jewelry and 
he give this to -- to my fa ther. And he said, Mr. He ger, you will 
give me  yi -- like usually, every day little bit.And this is how it happen. Every day my  father 
used to give him, like before, certain amount of je welry or mo ney, and he was taking this in, 

probably, or selling or -- a
nd then buying a food for us. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
51 
 
Q: And -- and so, right, a lot of mone y was used not 
for Socha to get rich n
ecessarily, but to -- to 
buy the food and the items that you needed, right? 
A: Right. 

Q: What happened after you ran out
 of money?  Was Socha able to afford buying these items for 
you on his own? 

A: He -- he p-paid for on his own for -- fo
r -- for the food. He probably had, you know, some  

money because th-the money that we -- my father paid him, it was a lot of money and not 

everything went for buying the f
ood, he probably had, and he us
ed this money t-t-to -- to 
continue.  

Q: So, if we can go back to describing just a li
ttle bit more the conditions of -- of where you were 
living, and you said that it was under this manhole c
over, in this -- this space that you stayed in 
for a good long period of time, do you know whe r e th
at is in Lvov?  Have you identified where 
that manhole cover is? 
A: Yeah, thi -- two years ago I went to Lvov, and 
I went to places that I reme mber for -- for -- 
that they were [indecipherable] where I was bor
n, when I live [indecipherable] and where we 
move from place to place in 
the gh -- ghetto, I identify each 
place, and identify the -- the 
ma nhole that we were lead -- it was leading to ou
r hiding place, to our palace. And if -- is funny 
because next  to the ma nhole right now is a coffe
shop and th-th-there were 
table and -- and chairs 
and people were sitting drinking co
ffee, drinking beer, and below it 
was a place that we used to 
live, 14 months. 
Q: And at the time you were there, what was a
bove, on the street level right above your ma nhole 
cover?  What was -- what was going on there, do you reme mbe r?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
52 
 
A: Yeah, it was a st -- a street. 
It is a small park next to a ch
urch, and i-it was a street and a 
sidewalk a- and buildings. And this is where th-t h-this
 is at -- he -- he -- this is -- we -- we were 
sitting under the s-street level. 
Q: Could some one open the ma nhole 
cover and just see you directly? 
A: They couldn™t th-th -- if so
me body opens the ma nhole, he has to go down, then he can see us, 
because you go -- i-i-is a pipe that leads you down and then you have like branch to the side, 

smaller one that lead -- that wi
ll lead you straight to our place
. That it was under the angle l-like 
45 de -- 90 degrees angle,
 th-the -- the branch. 
Q: Were there ever any cl -- any cl
ose calls like that while you were
 in that area of -- of people, 
you know, comi ng to see you, or -- or accident ally, you know, happening to see you that way?  

A: No, in this place, not. I-I -- we only were ve
ry ju -- you know -- we ke -- quiet, we kept our 
voices down, and -- because we could hear, 
you know, people outside ta
lking, I heard kids 
playing in the park and -- a
nd y-you know, picking up the flowers and I always ask my -- my 
mother if I will be able one day to go, to be out
si de and live like the other kids. And my mother 
always told me, don™t worry, the time will come 
that you will be among t he other ki ds, and you 
will pick the flowers, too. And th-this -- we -- we
 have to, you know, be very careful, because the 

people c-could hear us. And besides, after, you 
know, after the liberati
on when we came down, 
the concierge from the building that
™s -- that™s was next to the -- to
 the ma -manhole, she said that 
she was alwa ys very surprise because when it 
was snowing, th-the -- only this place around the 
ma nhole, this -- the snow was me lting. It was proba
bly from that w-we we
re cooking. Even that 
some ti me s we block -- when we we re cooking we 
used to block the -- the opening, that the smell 
will not go out, but probably from our  body, the h
eat from our body, that was radiating too, that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
53 
 
this -- that the -- it would -- the snow was 
me lting in this place. And she was always very 
curious, why only in this place the snow is me lting? 

Q: It certainly seems like such an unusual st
ory. Now, I don™t know if you™ve heard of other 
people surviving the war and the Holocaust this 
way in other places, but in Lvov, were the Nazis 
or the Germans thinking about th
is?  Thinking that ma ybe some body is down in the sewers hiding 
like this?  Do you think it wa
s, you know, on their radar?  
Q: I think wa  -- from the beginning, were -- when 
the liquidate the ghetto
, they -- they -- they 
knew that people were hiding. In -- i-in the se
wer they thr-throw even some places grenades 
through the manholes. But later 
on, th-th-they, you know, nobody could imagine that so long 
after the liquidation, you know, people can
 still survive 
in the sewer. 
Q: Now, besides your intact group 
of 11 at that stage, were th
ere any other groups that you know 
now, you know, did also survive this wa
y in those same  sewers in Lvov? 
A: No, from what I know and I, you know, was inte
rested to -- to find out and I reme mber my 
father too wa s interested, nobody. And Socha told us nobody survive in the sewer. And I don™t 

think so -- I don™t think that from the whole, 
you know, surviving stories that I heard, that is 
another one about the people who 
survive in the sewer. Maybe fo
r -- f-f-for two, three weeks, 
ma ybe in the Wa rsaw ghetto dur-d
ur-during the uprisal, ma ybe, 
but nobody for such a -- a length 
of period of time survive in the sewer.  

Q: When your mother would tell you, don™t worr
y, your time will come  to go outside again and 
pick flowers and be outside, did you -- did 
you keep a high level of hope, or did you get 
discouraged?  How did 
you feel, personally? 
A: Personally, y-you know, I -- from the beginnin
g I -- I hoped that, you k
now, that y -- i-it -- 
some how I -- we will st ay alive and I -- we will 
manage to -- to -- to -- you know, to -- to co-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
54 
 
come  out from this a-and live a normal life, but then I lost already when t-time  was pas sing, I-I -- 
I lost th-the hope. I reme mber that
 I -- it was a time that I was -- 
after ma ybe a year or some thing 
like this, I got very na -- depre
ssed. I got very me lancholy and depre
ssed, I didn™t want to talk to 
anybody, I di dn't want to accept the food, and I was completely, you know, in my -- living in my 

o-own world, completely l-losing faith that w -- that
 we can survive, that I can leave the -- th-the 

se -- the sewe r. And i-it -- it was like a few days
, or-or -- or -- or even longer, and then my 
mother didn™t know what to do and he -- she said to
 -- to Socha what happened, he was very -- he 
-- he -- and, you know, h-h-he was thinking about it a
nd he -- he tried to -- to help me , and he 
was very worry wh-wh-what happened to -- to
 me, and he -- he said to me one day 
[indecipherable] he took me  with him, he said, co
me with me and he took me to a si -- place in 
the sewer, to the -- under the ma
nhole, that I could see the light. 
And he -- he picked me  up, and 
he -- he said to -- to 
-- to me , l-look. L-L-Look at the light, 
and breathe th-th-the air. And he 
started to -- to -- to te
ll me  that y-you see, it will come  a d-d -- a time  you will be outside, you 
wi-will ha ve th-the  daylight, and 
you will li-live like other kids. 
We ll, you have to be pa tient  and 
don™t yi -- lose your hope. And he -- he took me  
back and then slowly, slowly, I started, you 
know, to accept the food, and I starte
d to talk. I-It was like a crisis 
in my staying there. And i-i-it 
happen. We  -- we survive. 

Q: Did you have, at any of the stages, where you 
were holding out hope, did you have a -- a faith 
in God?  Did you pray? 

A: W- We -- Berestitsky, one of th
e li -- 11 pe-people, he was ve
ry religious ma n, he had the 
tallis, and he was praying in the morning and he 
was praying in -- i-i-in 
the evening. And h -- th-
th -- during s-staying in the sewe
r, we  have a few tragedy th-t
hat happen. Once we have the -- 
the fire, that we thought that we 
all will be b-burned al-al-alive, a
nd I ask Berestitsky to pray to -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
55 
 
- to God, and once I remember we ha ve a flood, it was i-i-in spring when the s-snow was me lting 
and it wa-was terr ible hurricane too, and it was so much water then this sew-sewer was filled up 

and we -- th-the water came  so high that my mo
t her has to keep us high i-i -- up -- up to the 
ceiling that  we can bre-breathe. And the -- I --  I was 
sure that this is it, th
at we will drown there. 
And I was asking and begging Jacob to pray, Jacob, pray to God, pray to God. I found it, you 

know, that this is ma ybe th-th-the last resource, 
that we can hold it to 
-- to stay alive. And 

suddenly th-th-the waters star
ted to, you know, comi ng down, and 
we survive. The next day 
Socha -- Socha came, and he was s-sure that  he will f- fi nd only dead bodies there, and h-he said 

th-th- th-this is a mi racle that we survive. He -- he
 went to the church and 
he light a -- a candle, 
the thankful candle for -- for us.  

Q: How did your brother, you know, go through thes
e kinds of experiences?  You -- you had a 
certain approach, did your brother seem to ha
ve the same  approach, he™s younger. How did he 
kind of experience things? 
A: My brother was younger and he m -- he didn
™t reme mber  to -- too mu ch, you know?  He got 
used to -- to this. And he thought
 this is the whole world. This 
is the sewer and those 10 person, 
and he didn't -- from the beginning probably h-he 
-- he reme mbered, but la
ter on -- on, he forgot. 
Because when we were liberated, and we c-came -- emerge fro-fro-from t he -- the sewer and my 
brother, he started to cry that 
he wants to go back. He was scared from the people, he wa s scared 

that, you know, from the sunlight, from everything. He
 thought that the life is
 th-the -- the sewer, 
the rats, a-and those 10 people. A
nd this i -- this is h-how he r eacted. He -- h-he -- he -- I think 
ma ybe it was better for him that he didn™t reme
mber th-the things. This is why ma ybe I got 
depress and he didn™t.

Q: How did the group interact?  Are you -- do you wa
nt to -- [tape break]. So I wanted to ask you 
a little bit about th
e interactions within th
e group, if you can tell me , were people getting along 
very well, we re there any problems, and anythi
ng notable about some  of the individuals you 
were ther e with? 

A: We  were really strange people.
 Only my mother a-and my fath
er a-an -- and my brother and 
me  did -- you know, we were people that we knew each
 other, I never sa w rest of the pe ople ti-til 
we -- I found myself i-i-in -- in
 the sewer. And this -- the pe
ople, you know, is like, among the 
people some times you agree on some th -- on some thing, some thing, or you disagree. There are 

people who are more agreeable, you know, who 
will ge -- get along with everybody else, and 
people who -- who are not. Most of those peopl
e we were very, you know, we got along very 
good with each other. We had only one, Haskell, 
who was only -- if you said, this is white, he 
said this is black. He was only against, and he -- 
he was th-the only person that I really di -- was 
afraid of, and I didn™t like it. But re-rest of
 them was ma naging, you know, very nicely. We  had 
to s-spend our time there, you know, to be i-in 
the -- in -- engage in some  things, because 
otherwise you can go crazy sitting i-
in one place so long. And my father used to write come dies 
and we used to perform, everybody has a role, an
d perform hi s -- his part. We used to sing, we 
used to d-do a -- that™s mean the 
-- the grown-ups, they use -- used 
to -- especially my father and 
Helena, they used to do puzzles. Puzzles, a
nd they used to play
 a game that you call 
intelligentsia, that you have one word, and from 
the letters from this word, you have to ma ke 
new words. I don™t know if is a name  in English for this?  And who -- who will ma ke more 

words, i-is a winner. And always
 it was fight between my father
 and Helena because  she claime d 
that she has more and my father claime d that he 
has more, and he was telling her to go back to -- 
to gymnasia. And he -- he  -- you know, we tried 
to m- ma ke life little bit easier. And m- my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
57 
 
mother and my father, they used to teach 
me, you know, ca -- Socha br-brought book, elementar 
-- elementals, they call this. This is when the 
-- the f-first time you go to school, and you ra -- 
write ABC and words, and they used to teach me
 how to write, how to read, and they used to 
teach me  ma -math -- ma t hematics. How to -- to count, you know, add and mi nus -- plus and 

mi nus. And to -- to keep me  bi -- busy. 

Q: How could you see down there?  Was it dark? 

A: We  -- we had a -- a -- you know, a special ca
rbide lamp that was lightening the spa -- it 
wasn™t, you know, very bright, bu
t you -- you could s-see, yeah. 
And this was ho-how we si -- 
we spent our time, and wa -- oh -- oh -- usually afte
r breakfast that we have that we were waiting 
for Socha, when he come s and Socha and Wr obleski when they came, it was the -- th-the -- the 

best time  of the day, because we talk, he told us
 what™s going on. He used to bring some ti me s the 
newspaper for my father, and my father was re
-reading the newspaper and then he and Socha -- 
my father was a big general, he was planning 
the next [indecipherable] you know, mo ve of the 
Soviet army, of American army, of thi -- he was 
directing the fight i-in the sewer. They should 
go from this side, they should go from this side
. And -- and this is ho-how, then it wa s th-the 
dinner and then we did -- did some thing, play, 
and then we had to -- 
time for cleaning ourself 
from the lice. Every di-di-di --
 at five o™clock, I think, my mo
ther was taking our di-di -- undress 
us and killing those lices, and put -- lice, a
nd put the dress up. This
 was another function. 
Q: How did she do it? She would -- there would be live lice on you and then she would just kill 

each one? 

A: Yeah. Th-They used to th-th -- most of the time
 they were in the stitches of your dress. You 
have to turn the stitch 
and then you kill it, yeah. 
Q: Did you get lice in your hair? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
58 
 
A: Yes, yes, we -- we had -- but I had very short 
hair. They kept my hair very short like a -- like 
a boy, yeah. I went to the sewer with long, 
beautiful hair and then they cut it and 
[indecipherable] they grow. 
Q: And how was sleeping in the 
sewer, what was that like? 
A: Sleeping, it was another th-thing. We -- we sl
ept on the benches, on the planks, my father 
built from the planks that he found in the -- in othe
r part of the sewer, he -- he built th-th-the -- 
that -- they were supported on the 
one side of the wall, and on the other side of the wall. During 
the day he took it -- w-we took this and he -- we  
ma de it that we can sit, but for night we pu-put 

this, and we slept, you know, lik
e three people and thr
ee people in the row 
like this, long ways, 
because it wa s not so wide, it was narrow. I slept 
between Haskell and my  father. I sl ept right in 
between -- it was so tight that if one person want ed to turn around, three has to turn around in the 

s a me  t i me .   

Q: Would you say you got used to some  of thes
e routines in a way, or was -- you know, how 
much did this sort of feel like a very strange 
and difficult way to live, and how much did it feel 
like an adjust ment to a totally 
different kind of way of life? 

A: Is -- if -- with th
e time, you know, you -- you -- you get used to
 this. It was the daily routines 
that we had and we got used to this. We were
 ha-happy that, you know, that we were alive one 
day, and that we were a -- waiti
ng to another day, and we conti
nued th-the same  routine if we 
didn™t have anything like floods a
nd fire. And th-this is ho-how it 
happen in -- we -- he -- he -- 
you know, we got adjust. You can get a-a-ad -- ad
just to, I think a hum
an being, you know, can 
get adjust to anything. 

Q: How did you go to the bathroom? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
59 
 
A: Oh, we -- we tried to, you know, to keep one s
pot on the end o-of the tunnels only that we had 
a bucket and we used to do our duties there a
nd once a day in the morning, every time  some body 
else was taking this bucket, you know, out and th
rowing, you know, the waste to -- to -- to -- to 
the Peltew, and then come with the 
empty one. And this is h-how we did. 
Q: Did Socha bring water, or you alwa ys got your water within -- 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape number three, side 
B. So we were talking about how you got water. 

A: We  got water fr-from the sewe
rs. I-It was a -- every day some body di
 -- they -- they ke-kept -- 
you know, every day some body else, and mostly the 
-- the me n is a -- used to go and br-bring 

water, drinking water, yeah. But So
cha u-used to bring mostly food. 
Q: So I know that -- I know at 
least two stories about
 two of the individuals in the group, and I 
guess the two that I™m thinking of refers to
 this older woma n who was in your group -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- and this other woman, a younger woma n. 

A: [indecipherable]. Yeah, we had -- when we c-cam
e to this part of the 
-- or Socha took us to 
this part of the sewer that we stayed at, we were
 11 people, but it -- during the time  that we were 
there, I d-don™t -- after fe w months, Mrs. We i
ss, she -- she was a elderly woman and she had the 
asthma , she was sick and she was getting sick eac
h time, and he -- he -- her health deteriorated 
very much, and my mother used to take care of
 her, you know [indecipherable] to bring her food 
be -- beca -- when she could and even later on 
sit and try to feed her and try to always, you 

know, be with -- hold her hand and be
 with her and she said to -- to
 my mother that she -- she is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
60 
 
praying that my mother will s-stay 
alive, that  we will stay alive, and she sa id, ﬁI™m sure that God 
will hear me , and you will s-stay alive,ﬂ and wa --
 one night she -- she pa ssed away, and they t-
took her body and -- to the Peltew, 
and they thr-throw this to the 
water, to the Peltew. And -- and 
this was one thing that happened, and -- a-anothe
r was th-the Mrs. We inberg, when she did -- 
went down to the sewer she was pregnant but
 nobody knew about it, she was hiding. She was 
wearing a -- a big coat, bl ack coat and she was al
ways wearing this coat, 
and I -- I never saw her 
withou-ou-out this coat. Sh-She was hiding a
nd then after th -- you know, her pregnancy was 
very advance already. So me times even when we were passing through those small pipes, she 

couldn™t go through and we didn™t know why, we 
were pushing her, you know, through. Later on 
we discovered that this is because she was preg
na nt, she -- she [indecipherable] even imagine 
that the --  th-the pi pe wa -- the widt h that sh
e was when she was pregnant. And when we would 
discover that she™s pregnant 
[indecipherable] I™m talking about we, I didn™t. I didn't know 
anything and my brother didn™t anyway, di
dn™t know anything, but you know, the grown-ups, 
they -- that -- I knew that some thing™s going on b
ecause they were talking 
quietly and they were 
speaking Yiddish, then I know is some thing that 
I shouldn™t know. And finally -- th-th-they were 
afraid to tell Socha and Wr obleski that she is pregna
nt. Now I th -- I-I think 
that in the last day or 
two, they th -- they thought that  
she will give birt h, they -- they to
ld Socha that she is pregnant 
and that -- he -- he said, that is impossible that
 the -- the child will --  will survive here, a-and 

besides, he was afraid that the ch-child crying 
will, you know, le-led to our discovery of us by -- 
by people outside. And this -- that this was ve
ry dangerous. And -- but [i
ndecipherable] and they 
left, but meantime she -- day or two later, she 
-- she started to y-y-
you know, delivering a baby. 
And my father was the del-delivery ma n. I -- I knew 
it was on the side of the -- she was layi ng in 
the side of the -- the pipe, th-th-the -- the pa
rt, th-the -- of our compartme nt and the other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
61 
 
compart ment and my fat her had the rusty scisso
rs and he had this shoelace that he tied the 
umbilical  cord. And he deliver  the baby and I -- I re
me mber for a mo ment I heard the --  the --  the 
cry of a baby and then th -- i-it was quiet. My 
mother was helping my fat her, she was next to -- 
to Ginya We inberg and she -- she keep -- she wa
s trying to give the ba
by little bit water with 
sugar that he was sucking, but W- Weinbergowa, 
she was pulling my mot her away from the baby. 
She -- she -- she took the baby and 
she put on her chest and she kept
 and she didn't let my mother 
to -- to do it. And they were fighting among beca us
e my mother wanted to -- to -- to feed the 
baby and she di-didn™t want. And then my mother 
was so exhausted that she falled asleep. When 
my mother fall -- fall asleep, th
e -- she suffocate the baby. She sacrificed the baby because she 
knew that is no way that the baby 
c-can survive there. And th-the 
next day when the so -- th-they 
disposed the body of the ba -- the baby and next day wh-when Socha came , you know 
[indecipherable] people, we -- we 
told him that the baby, the -- it 
was a boy, and tha-that she ki-
kill the baby. And he was very upset because he
 wanted to arrange some thing with the n-nuns 
and bring -- take the baby to -- to the nuns
. But, you know, we didn™t know -- she didn™t know 
about that. It was so quick. Th-Thi
s is what -- this is what happen. 
Q: Did the baby have a name ?  

A: I don™t think so. I don™t think so. 

Q: Did you see the baby? 

A: I didn™t see the baby, no. I di
dn™t, I didn™t see. It happen 
probably when I was asleep. 
Q: Did you -- did you know that the -- what ha
d happen -- you knew what happened then, to the 

baby, afterwards? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
62 
 
A: I -- I knew that the baby had disappear. I didn
™t know anything. They -- they -- th-they -- I 
didn™t know anything. I didn™t know
 about pregnancy, I just -- didn™t know what pregnancy 
means, at all. And th-the -- for me  it was so
me thing strange, and na 
-- I didn™t know anything. 
Q: You knew there had been a baby and the baby
 disappeared, but you didn™t know that the baby 
had died.  
A: Th -- I didn™t know. I knew -- knew that some thing happen, but I didn™t know e-exactly what 

happen. I -- I only find out later, yeah. 

Q: Okay, I just want to actually ask a little b
it about any sort of religious observance, you know, 
as a group, any of the traditions that you were able
 to ma intain down in the sewers. Anything at 
all, that you reme mber? 

A: From -- wh-what I reme mber, like I me ntion 
already, that Berestitsky was religious, he had 
the tallis and he was praying and probably he 
knew when the -- all holy days are comi ng, but my 
-- my mothe r  kept every Friday 
evening, she light the candle -- 
Shabbat candles. And she ask -- I 
reme mber fr om the beginning, she ask Socha if who -- he wouldn™t mi nd to bring her candles to 

light again. He said no, no, no, and he
 was bringing her candles, and he like it very much that my 
mother kept the tradition. He was religious, and 
he -- Christian religion, but I think he knew what 
it is to believe, you know, in your 
religion, and he liked that my 
mother keeps the religion, the 
Jewish tradition. 

Q: What about any of, you know, th
e high holidays?  We re you able to ma rk them in any way? 
A: I don™t reme mber. I-I -- I know only that Yom 
Kippur we didn™t -- we ki ds could eat, but the 
grown-ups didn™t eat. This I reme mb er. But 
the other holy days, I don™t reme mber.  
Q: What about your birthday? 

A: Oh, I don™t reme mber  that we ever, you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
63 
 
Q: Did you know what day it was from day to 
day, the calendar, did you know anything about 
that? 
A: I-I-I di -- I -- maybe -- I di
dn™t know, ma ybe, you know, but my 
father knew, because he was 
up to date in politics and e-everything, he knew. 
But I -- I -- I didn™t, I -- 
I -- I di dn™t if -- for me, 
you know, I n-never knew ki -- when is day and what
 is night. It always
 w-wa -- I-I knew that 
day is morning when Socha is comi ng. This was my clock. Otherwise I didn™t know if is day or 

night.  

Q: And how did you prepare food dow
n there?  Di d you have a stove? 
A: We  had the carbide st-stove, th-that Mrs.
 We inbergowa she was cooking the soup, and what 
we cook else is only probably boiling water for -- 
for -- for this s-so calle
d coffee. But otherwise 
we -- we didn™t use the -- it was very primitive carbide st -stove. 

Q: I think there was a time  -- I wa
nted to ask a little bit more about
 -- sort of your -- your health 
and the health of your brother as well. There was a 
time where I think he had an injury to his leg?   
A: Yeah, he -- I think he fall on his step wrong, that
 -- an-and my father said that he has a broken 
leg, and he -- y-you know, they kept this unmob
ile, and it healed. It healed by -- by -- you know 
[indecipherable] self. You did -- th
is is -- if you have broken leg ri
ght now, the thing is to keep 
this steady in the -- immobilized. Yeah. 

Q: And was there any effort to get any sort of additional help for him, or was that  just  

impossible, given the circumstances? 

A: It was impossible. Wh-Wha- Wha t can you do, 
it i -- it is impo -- impossible. When he -- once 
he had the sore throat, he -- he -- he -- h-he 
couldn™t speak, you know, wi -- and Socha, when he 
came, he ask my mother, ﬁMi -- Mrs. Heger, 
what do you think will help hi m? ﬂ And my mother 
said, you know, the only thing -- she knew that 
we cannot get any me - medication because Socha 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
64 
 
wo-wouldn™t go to -- to pharmacy to buy, because  he
 was afraid that they will t -- ask who wrote 
the prescription, because my father could writ
e, but -- pr escript -- he know how to write 
prescriptions, but he was afraid to do it. A
nd my  mother said, you know, 
the only thing what can 
he-hel-help him is Goge l Mogel. This is a -- 
Gogel Mogel is that you 
take the egg yolk with 
sugar, and you mi x it -- mi x it to
 the -- to-together and you swallow 
this. And he said, oh, this is 
the only -- she said, yeah, this is ma ybe. And 
you know, after Socha left, after ma ybe two hours, 
we -- we heard th-the -- the noise of some
body c o mi ng. You know, this sloggish noise, shu, shu, 
shu. And w-w-we -- my father and Corsage -- 
th-the -- Mondek, he wa
s standing, you know, next 
to the ho -- hole that he was cu -- comi ng, and th
ey wanted, you know, to hit him, because they 
thought that this is some body strange is 
comi ng. And they finally, you know, it was 
[indecipherable] they saw Socha f-face. He br
ought three eggs. He gave these eggs in a 
handkerchief, you know, tied at those four corners, 
and he put in hi -- in his mouth, he was 
holding with his teeth, and this is how he b-brough
t th-those three eggs that
 my mother can ma ke 
a Gogel Mogel for my brother. This ki
nd of person he was. It™s unbelievable. 
Q: And he cou -- 

A: It help. It help, and he was very happy. 

Q: And your own health, were there any of these 
sorts of episodes that ever happen with yourself 
as well, or mostly your brothe
r™s health was -- was more the focus, would you say, or -- 
A: It™s mostly my brother. I was always healt
hy. Only -- I had only this 
episode of -- that I was 
so depressed. That was more, you know, the me nt
al, psychological than the physical. But no, I -- 
I -- I-I was healthy, besides the -- the -- the terri
ble diarrhea that we had in the beginning, the 
dysentery, but I-I was okay. 

Q: And once you had that it didn™t return, 
it was really just 
at the beginning? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
65 
 
A: No, he didn™t return. Thank God he didn™
t. We got immune and he didn™t return. 
Q: And also, just curious, were you -- were you 
wearing the sweater that
 your grandmother gave 
you, often, or what -- what were you wearing dur
ing this time ?  Did you have any change of 
outfits, or we re you always wearing the same  thing, really? 
A: W- We  -- most of the t-time -- we wear the same
 thing. I-I -- I ne -- reme
mber that I had like a 
tee shirt I was we-wearing, and on 
this I was wearing this sweater
, or I had some thing else too, 
but i-i -- th-the tee shirts, once a week or twi
ce a week my mother was changing on us and Socha 
was taking our clot hes, you know, f-f-for -- for la
undry. He -- his wife, she was cr -- doing the 
laundry for us, and he was taki
ng the dirty clothes and bri 
-- bringing the clean ones.  
Q: So now will you st art telling me  
a little bit more -- I mean, now we
 can get into the details of 
actually when the Russians are starting to come  
in. What did you know ahead of time, what did 
you know at what point, you know, when th
ings were starting to change? 
A: My f-father used to discuss with Socha alwa
ys th-th- th-the politics 
and what™s going outside, 
and Socha used to always bring the news. I 
think that he belonged to organization, the 
underground Polish organization, and he knew 
wh-wha-what™s going on, and we knew that, y-
you know, the eastern front is comi ng, that the Russian
 -- that -- that th-th-the German lost the 

Stalingrad and they are now -- 
now retreating, and we were v-
very happy. We  were always 
waiting and waiting wh-when it will
 happen. And my father discu
ss this. I didn™t d-discuss, you 
know, the politically -- from the point of view of
 politically, I -- I only 
was waiting til we can ge-
get liberated and I can go out. I didn™t know what™s
 the eastern front and this front or th-th-this 
wasn™t in my interest a-at that time . And they
 didn™t discuss with me , 
whatever I overheard is -- 
but I -- I n -- I knew, a-a-at the end, you know
, my father was losi
ng already hope. He was 
getting depressed too. He  was -- he was so anxious
ly waiting til we will be
 liberated that every 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
66 
 
day it was for him like a year. He couldn™t wait for th
is, he was very, very nervous that -- the last 
few -- few weeks, ma ybe two mont hs or some thing. 
He -- he -- he was always afraid that it can 
turn back, you know?  But i -- he knew really what™s
 going on with this, he read the newspaper, 
Socha was u -- he bring him a news -- a Polish 
newspaper and some ti me  German ne wspaper, he 
read from the b-b-both sides.  
Q: And so were you also feeling 
that some thing is in the air, 
some thing was changing, or did you 
only know at the very last mi nute some thing had changed? 

A: No, I think that ma ybe the last few days, 
you know, we knew that some thing -- I knew that 
some thing is going o-o-on, because my father wa
s v-very, you know, al-already restful. He -- he 
-- h-he couldn™t already wait. And this is w
hy I knew that some thing is comi ng, but yo-you 
know, we took day by day. I think that a ma  -- th
at the one who was really reliving this, you 
know, this comi ng liberation th-t
he most was my f-father.  
Q: Was your father the leader
 of this group, would you say? 
A: Yeah, this is what Socha call him, that he is  the leader, that he is th-th-the group. He is the 

captain, he -- he say -- he said. And he always ask my fath
er and always t-told everybody, 
whatever Heger said, th-th-that™s it,
 a-and he always ask my -- my fa
ther th -- if he agrees, or -- 
or if he has the plan, or he has some  ideas or some thing, yeah. 

Q: I read in the book by Robert Mars
hall that they even drank a little vodka together, is this -- is 
this a -- 

A: Oh! 

Q: -- true story?  Do you reme mber this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
67 
 
A: Yeah, yeah. This is a -- this is true. This is
 -- Socha used to bring some times with -- were s-
some occasion, some birthday, or on my mother birthday, the July 23
rd
, he -- he brought some  -- 
[tape break] 

Q: So I was just asking you about vodka. 

A: Yeah, some  occasion Socha used to bring so
me  -- some  vodka and th-they used to, the -- the 
grown-ups u-used to, you know, d-
drink wi-with him and my  father
 al-always was very worrying 
that -- that they will not get -- Socha and Wr
obleski will not ge t drunk. And this is why he 
always drank the most amount of vodka because he
 didn™t let them to -- to be drunk because he 
was afraid, you know, when you drunk you can say some
thing. But wi -- s -- Socha, once he -- 
he says --  said to my father that  a --  that he -- 
my father is afraid that he will get drunk, th-that he 
will sa-say so me  -- he -- he -- he felt, you know
, that m- my father is accusi ng him of get dr-
drunk, and then my father said no, no, you know. [i
ndecipherable] fo-fo-fo-forgive me, I didn™t 

mean like this. But he was afraid. 
Q: So what happened next?  What wa s the mo me nt that everything changed? 
A: When we  got li-liberated.  

Q: I-If that™s the next thing, you know, what -- what led up to that, or  what, you know, happened 

-- 

A: We ll, we had another th-thing that ha -- th
at happened, that the few weeks, ma ybe three 
weeks before the li-liberation, suddenly Socha 
came  with another person. And he wa -- th-this 
was a -- a young ma n who was a deserter f -- he -- 
he was fighting on -- on the Russian side. He 
was Ukrainian that fighting with the Germans on 
the Russian side. And he got to m -- he was 

POW, the German t-took him in prison, and he --
 he was a POW for -- for -- i-i-in the -- Russian 
POW in the German, and they treat them terrible.
 Th-Th-They tr-treated 
--  i-it was unbelievable 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
68 
 
how the German ter-terrible treat 
the Russians, the POWs. They tort ured and th-the terr ible -- 
and wa -- one of the thing that they did that th
ey forced them t o fight -- to put the German 
uniforms and fi ght against Russians, against thei
r will. And he -- he escape. Somehow he -- he 
deserted the -- th-th-the German
 ar my, and Socha™s wife sister
 find him someplace a-and give 
him a hiding place, and they fall in love. He 
-- he was very good l-looking young ma n, and the 
only place -- and they knew the Russians are co
mi ng, and they knew that Russian will kill hi m 
because he fought with German aga i nst the Russian. 
The German, if they will ca-catch him, he is 
a desert er, they will kill him. Th-The only place th
at he can survive, it wi
ll be in the sewer. And 
Socha brought him to the sewer. Whe n he came a
nd he saw this, he si-si 
-- he turn around, he 
wanted to run. He said, in this condition he is
 not living. You must be 
-- th-th-this is like a-
animals. You must be animals, no-not human be
ing that you can stay here more than one day. 
And he i-i -- ya -- he was mi serable. He only wa
nted to escape. And Socha gave a gun to my 
father, and he said, if he wants to escape, s
hoot him. And they took turns, you know, every few 
hours some body else was watching him that he won™
t escape. And this is how it happened to the 
-- til -- til the liber ation. 

Q: What was his name? 

A: Tola. Tola. He -- after the -- I-I think after th
e -- the liberation that  the Russian took him back 
to the army and he was killed in the army, yeah. 

Q: I didn™t know that, I™m not even sure -- ma
ybe it™s in the book. Maybe
 those are the last 20 
pages that I didn™t read. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: I™m sorry, I tried to read all of it, but -- bu
t wow, I didn™t know that some body else had joined 
you like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
69 
 
A: Yeah, Tola. 
Q: So -- so now you are a total of 11? 

A: We are at -- back in 11, because he™s the 11
th
 person. And, you know, we heard already 
[indecipherable] the planes, the Russians planes
 we re comi ng and he -- bombs were falling, and 
we were afraid that the bomb can hit the se
wer because you are under the ground, very under th -
- under the surface, you know, and the bomb can h
it the -- the street and you are exposed, and 
you are killed. And this was -- this 
I reme mber I was so afraid of, whene ver I heard the noise o-
of the a-airplane, I would start to shaking, b
ecause I was -- I heard the bombs falling, I said, oh, 
okay, that™s it. It was -- this was one thing that
 I was so scared, and after the flood, the rain. 
When I heard the drop rain falli
ng, I already was panicked. And -- 
a-and then the Germans were 
-- th-they started to dig and putting mi nes above 
us. And we heard the digging, the digging, and 

we -- we were starting, you know [indecipherable], but 
it -- it -- it -- it™s gonna
 -- it started to -- t-
taking the -- the carbide that we used to the lamp, 
th-the disposed carbide they used to move to 
the side when they heard the digging is co
mi ng. You know, the German were digging from up, 

and then we were filling from downst a irs that 
they couldn™t get in. But it wa -- it -- Socha came 

in, we said to Socha, and he -- he we nt ou-ou
t to the street and Kowaliw, you know, wa -- he was 
with the authority that he is 
the -- the ma intenance commander and he said to the German, you 
cannot dig here because there is a 
gas pipes here. And th-they didn™t 
want -- and he said le-let me  
talk to the re-responsible pers
on here. It was some German, s o me  Nazi, some  Gestapo, I don™t 
know. And he said to -- to him, 
listen, those are gas pipes, the 
mo ment you hit the gas pipes, you 
will all blow up. Th -- and they stopped digging. This is -- you know, every day was br inging 

some thing, but it was to the end on the -- a-already, 
and you are so afraid that
 in the last mo me nt 
some thing can happen. You suffer s o much. And 
-- and we heard, you know, the -- the artillery. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
70 
 
We knew that the Russian are -- are -- are close 
already. We  -- we heard -- we -- we were scared 
from the bombs and then, but we -- we knew they
 are comi ng. And my - -  my father was ti -- 
watching Tola, and it was time that the sh
ift was changing that th -- Mondek, the 
[indecipherable] was taking over and my father was so
 tired he went to slee
p and I fall asleep and 
he was asleep. And then, when he was a sleeping,
 it was like early in the morning, suddenly we 
heard the noise, like some body is banging o-on 
the crates, you know, on the ma nhole, the -- the -
- the iron --  
Q: Gr-Grate? 

A: Grate, grate. I-Iron grates. And we we
re, you know, everybody was come , my father was 
asleep, he was so tired. And the rest was in the 
[indecipherable] was -- was listening and then he 
heard Heger, Heger, Corsage, you are free, you ar
e free, you can come  out. And he -- he said, I 
am giving you the plan how to go to -- each way to
 go. And he gave us to go th-through those -- 
we grabbed whatever we c -- you know, we ha
d no-nothing, and we -- we -- we was crawling 
through those pipes til we came to the -- to the poin
t that he said, th-this is the point  that you 
have to come  out and if -- through it was the ma
nhole, and he was open 
and he was standing, and 
he said that the children are co
mi ng first. Then Mrs. Heger, then the wome n and then you, and 
then the last  is comi ng Heger, the captain. The cap
tain is coming the last. 
And this is why -- how 
we ca-came out. It was a courtyard 
next to the -- not far away fr
o m the sewers that we were 
hiding, above was a courtyard. He ca
lled all the people, and he -- he 
told them to stay and watch, 
and they watched like we were comi ng, like ra
ts, you know, we were come  -- and my brother 
when he came  out, he started to cry. He said he
 wants to go back. He wa
s so scared. He forgot 
how the world look like. He thought that the whol
e life, his whole world is the sewer and those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
71 
 
rats and -- a-an-and that™s it, th
ose 10 people. He was crying a
nd he was pulling my mother, like 
I want to go back, I want to go back, 
and she explained to him in the -- 
End of Tape Three, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
72 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape numbe
r four, side A. Okay, go ahead. 
A: When we  all came ou-out -- emerge from -- 
from the ma nhole of the courtyard, my father was 
the last one, because this is what
 Socha said, that the captain is 
comi ng the last. And he -- he was 
so proud and he was smiling so ha r -- and he sa
id to the people who are standing and watching, 
and surprised they were, you know, so shocked, and he said, ﬁThose are my Jews. This is my 
work.ﬂ He was so proud. He -- imme diately, you 
know, he -- he went to the building and he 
started organize. The -- th-th- they were the empty a-apartment with the -- because the -- the 

Germans run ni -- run away. A-And he -- he said, th
is room will be for Heger, this is for Clara 
and [indecipherable] this is for We inbergowa. He
 was the organizer, he set up everything, yeah. 
And then next day I think that he brought his wi
fe and his daughter to me et us, and we  me t -- we 
me t the m. It was unbelievable, 14 months. 
Q: Now, how long we
re you there again? 
A: We  were 14 months in the sewe
r. We e merge in July 27, ™44.  
Q: Can I just -- tell me  how old were
 you at this time  when you got out? 
A: F -- f -- ™44 I was -- I was end -- eight and half, yeah. 

Q: Did you know the date, or you only later l
earned what the date was when you came  out? 
A: I -- I knew the date because we were so
 anxi ous that, you know, everybody was counting the 
days, and we knew that this is July. And 
y-y-you know, it was fu-funny thing, because a few 
weeks before th-the li-liberation 
-- it was ma ybe like a month before, or sa -- or six weeks, that 
Berestitsky, he woke up and he said that he ha
d a dream, and he ask who is born in July?  And 
my mother said, July 23 is -- I was born July 23.And he -- he said that we will be -- we -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
73 
 
will be liberated in the day of my 
mo ther or a little bit later, that he had a dr eam, and he knew the 
-- the date. This why I reme mber
 exactly July --  July 27. 
Q: Did you know that the, you know, other parts of
 the war were still going on?  We re you aware 
of this? 
A: We really were liberated July 23
rd
, on my mother birthday, but 
Socha, during the liberation, 
the mo m -- he didn™t come  to the sewers. We  
-- he -- he -- he supply us with food before, 
because he knew he won™t be able to -- to come
, and he didn™t want us t -- let us out. He was 

waiting few days, because  it happen in another cit
y, in Tarnopol that after the German left, and 
the Russian came, the Jews went out and then th
e German ca me  back, and they all were killed. 
This is why he didn't want to, he wa
ited few days. That m- me ans July 23
rd
 on my birthday, 
probably this is when the -- th
e Russian came. This is what
 the prophet Berestitsky said.  
Q: So what were your first impressions when 
you got out -- outside a
nd above ground again? 
A: When we  got out -- at first I didn™t see almost
 anything a-and then when I start to see it was, 
everything was yellow. You know what, my -- my si
ght was terrible til my
 eyes get adjust to 
daylight. And then we were -- looked so terrib
ly, you know, th-th-th -- the dress that we  were 
wearing, things -- we -- we looke
d terrible, because I reme mb ered when I was on the street with 
my brother, some  woma n, she -- she passed us 
and he brought s-some  fruit, gooseberries. And 
she had it in the bag and she looked at us and sh
e said -- and she gave us, and he said ha -- 
children, have this. Sh-She felt the pity for us. 
This is -- we -- we pr
obably looked terrible. I 
didn™t look to the mi rror.  

Q: Were you -- were you very skinny at that 
point, were -- you know, because you weren™t eating 
very much, or how -- how was your
 appearance in that regard?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
74 
 
A: I -- I -- fi-fir -- I was skinny, 
th-this is -- is one. The second, 
I had the infection. I have like 
abscesses from malnutrition. I-I sti
ll have scars fr-from this, and my father was very sick, too, he 
had a lot of those abscesses. And he wa -- he wa
s very -- very, very sick and thank God it was, 
you know, penicillin that was discove
r, and my father was a -- wa
s one of the first one, almost, 
who got penicillin injection. And this, 
you know, s -- bring him his health back. 
Q: Did you need anything like that? 
A: I -- I didn™t -- didn™t. I wasn
™t in such a critical 
condition that my father -- yeah, that -- with 
me , it -- it we nt through ba -- by themselves. They 
-- probably ma ybe I a-ate better, o-or --  
Q: How about your mother and your brothe
r, how wa -- how was th-their health? 
A: My brother was very skinny. He was so skinny 
that -- unbelievable is th
at his two legs were 
like two -- two -- two sticks. And my  -- m- my fa
ther and my mother, they both were, you know, 

they didn™t ke-keep straight. Their posture was 
completely, y-you know, it -- i-it -- it -- they -- 
they were bent, they had -- b
ackbone was completely dismanaged. Th-Th-Th -- they we re bent, 
they couldn™t -- being bent for -- for -- for 14 
months, the only time th
ey could -- they could 
straight is when they were ly
ing down. And it -- it -- 
it -- this -- th-th-they -- and sh-she was 
skinny too, my -- my mother. But she didn™t have this
 -- this infection that my fathe r  had, but she 
-- she -- she looked 
terrible, too. 
Q: So did you really believe this was it, you™d fi
nally ma de it?  Would you -- were you at all sort 
of questioning, could anything else go wrong or cha
nge, or did you feel like we did it, we ma de it 
and you all sighed a big sigh of relief? 

A: I think that we f-feel -- 
we -- we fe lt that we, you know, ar
e safe, at least fr-from the 
Germans, you know, that we ma de 
it, that you know, that we are liberated, we right now can try 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
75 
 
to -- to live norma l life, and we had the hope, 
you know. It was very difficult, because no jobs, 
no th -- no -- no -- no -- no money, nothing. A
nd i-it was very harsh and difficult time. 
Q: And wha t  kind of anti-Semitism greeted you at that point? 

A: Ha -- I -- I -- I know that we 
were liberated in end of July, 
and in September, the school was 
supposed to start, first of September is school year
 start and my mother went to m -- to the school 
and to register me  and the -- the secretary ask 
my  mother, you know the name , th-th-the fa mily 
name, the fi rst name, the age when -- all th-th- th
ose details, and she ask 
what religion. And my 
mother s-said moisia showa. Moisia showa,
 it me an you are Jewish. And she looked at my 
mother, and she said excuse me , and she went to th
e principal to ask if she can regi ster a Jewish 
child. And when she came  back my  mother was 
so angry, and my mother said, ﬁDid -- did you 
go to the principal to ask if you can register a 
-- a Jewish kid to school? ﬂ  She -- she didn™t say 
anything, and she register me  to s -- t-to school, a
nd I started to -- to go to
 -- to school, but I -- I 
felt very bad, and you know, because my -- I didn™t ha-have shoes. My father ma de shoes from 
old newspapers and sh -- sa -- ma ke shoes for 
me, cover ma -- ma -- my 
feet. And I had this, you 
know, that -- this clothes t-terr
ible, and I fe-felt very bad. I -- 
I reme mber that I was running, I 
didn™t walk, I was running because 
I thought if I run that less peopl
e will see that I ha -- don™t 
have the shoes, only tho-those newspapers. And I re
me mber one of the girls, she was sitting -- I 
reme mber her face. She was sitting next to me, one
 day she ask me why I am writing from left to 
right? Th -- I should write from ri
ght to left. I didn™t understand wh
at she is talking about. I came 
home  and I said, ﬁMom, why is she™s telling me  th
at I should write from ri
ght to left, not from 
left to right?ﬂ She said, ﬁBecause Jewish alphabe
t, Hebrew, you write from 
right to left.ﬂ And 
she knew that I am Jewish, this is why she was 
asking me  why I am writing this way and not this 
way.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
76 
 
Q: We re you the only Jewish child in your class? 
A: Yeah, I was the only gi -- Jewish child. Withm- my luck, I was almost always only Jew in the 

class.  

Q: And did you experience other sort of incide nt
s with other students or
 teachers or anybody else 
sort of ma ke  you feel bad in that way? 

A: No, no, no, i-in Lvov -- we left Lvov in ™45, i-in
 I think ma -- March ™45. This mean I didn™t 
go to -- to -- to s-school too 
long in Lvov. But I -- I reme mb er very vividly. I study Polish, I 
study Russian, I had to, you know, say th-that -- by 
heart all the life of Leni
n and Stalin, all those 
communist propaganda. And we -- we -- in ™45 March 
we escape, and we  run to -- to Kraków, to 

Poland, because it -- in the Russian
 says that -- tha -- 
i-i-it came a law that P-Polish p-people who 
want to immigrate to p -- to Poland -- because 
at that time , r-right now, Lvov is already Russia, 
then y-you can emigrate t-to Poland. And i -- we 
-- we want in, and besides th-the Russian, you 
know, it -- they wanted to send my father and us 
I think to Siberia because they found out that 
we were bourgeois before the war, and this 
is, you know, terrible in
 -- under the Russian 
communist governme nt. And th-then, another th
ing was th-they suspected that anybody who 
survived during Holocaust must be schpern, spy. Th
is was -- this is why I reme mber my fa-father 

came one evening and he said let™s leave, and we 
left everything, whatever we have and we went 
to -- a-and we left to the railro
ad station, to the -- they were lik
e cattle trains, and we stayed 
there, we were hiding there, and it took us three weeks til we got to Kraków.  

Q: Three weeks on those trains? 

A: Three weeks on this train that
 right now it take s few hours, b
ecause it was after the war, the 
bridges were, you know, des-destroyed. And I do -- I 
reme mb er just winter, it was so cold tha -- 
my fa ther was burning little bit wate
r for us i -- like in the sewer, 
he d -- he did in the -- from the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
77 
 
s-sardines, y-you know, a -- a can?  He  
used to put some  water in the warming, this -- this is what 
he did there, too, that we will have some war m water.  
Q: So this was yet another big change. 

A: Yeah. It was another thing, we came  to -- t-
to Kraków, and i -- I went
 to school in Kraków 
and my mother regi ster me already 
-- not -- she didn™t want to regi
ster me  th-th-that I am Jewish, 
because after the war they had still pogroms 
in -- in Poland. And some
body told her, you know, 
for her safe, say that she is Christian, and my a
unt , because during the war she survive, she was a 
ma id to a -- a priest , she knew the all prayers, 
and she taught me  the pray
ers. I had -- have to 
learn when I went to school that I knew when to
 say, what to say when I went to church that I 
know -- know what to say. And I -- 
the -- the principal, a woma n -- very nice woma n, very nice 
woma n, she knew that I am Jewish, and she said 
to my mother, you know, for her sake, let™s say 
that she is Christian. And this is
 how I -- I was i-in Poland, til I we
nt to high school. When I went 
to high school my mother sa
id that this is enough, now
 you are going, you are Jewish. 
Q: But y -- had your name changed?  Had your family changed its name ? 

A: Yeah, when we came to Kraków, you know, the pe
ople advise us th -- ya
 -- change the name  
that sounds more Polish, not J -- Jewish. And 
we change from Heger to Herowski, cause 
Herowski sounds very Polish.  

Q: And so nobody would question you or your 
family?  Did anybody give you a hard time and 

suspect that you were Jewis
h, or anything like that? 
A: They suspected we are Jewish. They suspected I was Jewish because wa  -- wa -- one time th -

- sa -- mothers of the few kids fro-from school, 
from class, they came to the principal and they 

ask her if Krisha is Jewish. And the principal 
said no. And she said, why you asking?  Because he 
-- she is too smart. This wa
s their answer. That
™s really, you know, the-they always -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
78 
 
reme mber th-the sign on the building across th
e street from us, Krishka [indecipherable], 
Kristine, she™s a Jewish. She™s a Jew. I -- I we
nt to Poland, you know, a fe w years ago to Kraków 
and I was looking for the sign, it™s not there. 
Q: What is the sign?  I™m not su
re I understand. So me body put a sign? 
A: Some body wrote, you know, o-on the wall. 

Q: Graffiti? 

A: Graffiti. Graffiti. Krishka [speaks Polish] it means -- in Polish it means Krisha a Jew.  

Q: And that was for you. 

A: This was for me  because I live across the 
street, the windows, you know, from the windows I 
could see the sign.  

Q: Did that bother you a gr
eat deal at that time? 
A: It -- it bothers me , you know. It hurt me , but
 after what I went thr
ough, I didn™t care. I knew 
that I -- th-this is it, that is 
anti-Semite, that I have to be ve
ry careful what I say, what I do. I 
grew up with -- in this, the -- th
at I knew it. I -- I really 
-- like you, you know, you get used to 
this, you -- you know, that you are a 
presi -- prosecuted, and yo -- I got 
used to -- used to this.  
Q: But at least your family didn™t feel imme diate danger in the same  way before, even though 

there was an awareness of -- of the anti-Semitism in Kraków, ri ght? 

A: Yeah, it was much better, fir-first you know, th
e -- the governme nt, we -- i-i-it was later on 
communist too, and a-according 
to the doc-doctrine, communist
 doctrine, everybody is equal. 
They cannot -- officially they cannot do anything 
against Jews, but unofficially, under the table, 
they did whatever th-they could to -- to hurt 
the Jews. But th-this is the -- yo-you know, he -- he 
di -- we knew that we are Jewish and we knew that
 he -- we have, you know, to carry this -- this 
bag. But i-i-it wasn™t that we were afraid that 
some body will come  and will ki ll us or some thing, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
79 
 
n-no. And later on -- l-later, we 
di -- we didn™t have any offi
cial, you know, pogroms or things, 
and ma ybe it happened, you know, some  of -- one pers
on killed the other person, but th-th -- th-
th-the -- it weren™t like after s 
-- immediately after the war. I-It 
was much b-better, the anti-S-
Se mitism was, you know, hiding. They -- they -- it wasn™t so obvious, open, because yi -- it 
shouldn™t be.  

Q: Wa s there one occasion where your mother ha
d heard about a pogrom nearby and -- and was 
worried for your safety? Wa s that in Kraków? 

A: Yeah, th-this was in Kraków
 when the pogrom in Kielce. Was I -- I reme mber I was -- my 
mother was working and I was by myself with my 
brother and I went to a ma rket to buy some  
vegetables, and my mother wrote me  what I have
 to buy at th -- for cooking, and it was a one 
neighbor, a-and she -- she came downstairs and sh
e said, Krisha, what are you doing here?  Go 
home , go imme diate -- and I, you know, I was with
 my brother, holding his hand, and she said, 
go home  imme diately. And I run ho
me. When I came home my moth
er was running and she said 
go home . Go -- this is when it happen i-i-i-in Ki
elce. I think in Kraków they have pogrom too.  
Q: So school proceeded and you act
ually enjoyed some  parts of school, or was it a difficult time 

for you?  

A: No, I e-enjoy, I didn't -- you know, I knew that I 
am playing a role. I knew that I am Jewish, 
and th-th-this is only a game  to -- to -- for me  
to survive, a-and I knew 
it and I c-continue with 
the -- I went with my friends fr-fr-from school, I 
went to the -- th-the church, and I si-si -- you 
know -- you know, wi -- all the procedure what™s goi
ng in the church here 
I did, I knew how to 
do it.  

Q: You had your first communion? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
80 
 
A: I had my first communion and I have pictures
. I went to the churc
h, now that I was i-in 
Poland, I went to the church, I saw the church
 a-and I found a -- a-a m -- yeah -- you know, a 
plaque there for comme moration 
for John Paul the second. What 
happened, the times that I was 
going to the church, he was the pr
iest. He was comi ng there and sayi
ng the prayer -- prayers, that 
maybe when I was there he said the pr ayer. 
Q: What did you think about that experience, di
d you sort of always reject when you were in 
church, you know, in your head what was happeni
ng, or did you enjoy any 
part of the -- the 
rituals that you were 
part of in church? 
A: I didn™t enjoy the ritual, I kne
w that I am playing, you know, that I am playing game . And to -
- to prove it, you know when you take -- when th
e ma ss, end of the ma s s, you have people who 
are comi ng to take the communion, y
ou know, the -- the -- the white -- 
Q: The wafer. 

A: Wa fer, yeah, the whi -- the wafer, yeah, and 
you -- is a way that you have to take it. You 
cannot bite on this. You can take on end of your 
tongue and swallow. And I wanted to prove it 
that I™m Jewish, that I don™t believe what I am
 doing, I was always biting. Like, you know, revolt 
against. 

Q: Interesting. So -- 

A: [inaudible] 

Q: I think I reme mber some thing about you, 
wa-was it during the summe r time you would go on 
vacation and you had a -- a sort of incident or  so
mething with a Polish -- a Polish farmer rented 
you a room and there was some thing 
that came  up at that time ? 
A: Yeah, i-i-it -- it -- usua lly during vacation, 
because of our health pr oblem, we were so 
ma lnourish, and that my parents always wanted, 
you know, to -- us to goto the countryside, to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
81 
 
the villages, because we -- then we can have a 
fresh milk, fresh eggs, everything fresh and build 
up little bit our -- ou
r health. And my father rented a room
 and we went with my mother, we 
stayed there. And then afte
r awhile we  -- y-you know, my 
m- mother pay attention that 
some thing, you know, the people are going around the 
house that th -- we were staying and one 
night she heard noises next to our door, even th
-the door were locked. And I reme mbe r  th-th-the 
ne-next day or two the -- the woma n from which we
 rented th-th-the -- the apartment, she came 
to my mother and he said, ﬁYou know, it will be  
much better for you if you leave, because they 
are planning to kill you.ﬂ And, because from th
e beginning, she didn™t know that we are Jewish, 
but some how you know, those people around, they f
ound out. They had a ver -- th-the -- the cris 
-- Pole -- Poles were very good nose to find the Jew.
 And the -- w-w-we -- we left. We  left, my 
mother -- my mother called my fathe r , or g-g-got 
in touch with him and by train it -- or he ca-
came by car, I don™t remember, a-an-and we left, becau
se we were afraid that they will kill us. 
They were running with the knife, and when we 
only c-came  a  day or two after, you know, my -- 
th-th-th-the woma n that we re
nted the house talked to my mo
ther, we were walking and she 
think, you know, Hitler, the Germans were bad. The 
one thing bad that he -- Hitler di d, it was 
that he didn™t kill the whol
 -- whole Jewish population.  
Q: You™ve been back to Poland 
as recently as a month ago -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- I believe, and I don™tknow how ma ny times since -- sin
ce the war, but have things 
changed?  

A: I -- I went few -- few times becau -- because I ha-had to go, and besides, you know, Poland is 

beautiful country. The nature is so
 beautiful, the mountains
 and the lakes, the rivers, th-th-that is 
bu -- really beautiful. I enjoy it 
to look at the nature. I am not so proud and happy about the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
82 
 
people who -- who live there. I th
ink that the new generation has 
a different view. Th-They are 
changing. They, you know, are learning much more 
and they are learning much mo re about the 
Jew -- Jewish culture. They are learning right no
w about the Holocaust, they never learn about 
the Holocaust during the communist governme nt
, you know, the -- and I 
hope -- I hope it will 
change. You can see the difference in the big c
ity, like for example, in Kraków y-you talk to 
people they -- th-they -- they talk
 the -- completely different, but in the small villages, I don™t 
know if it™s so much cha nge. A
nd th-th-the -- the big influence 
is the church. 
The -- the -- the 
anti-Jewish propaganda is even still there. Y
ou know, the special thing that they are blaming 
Jews for killing Jesus, for his blood and th-things
. It -- even though the John Pope the second, he 
-- he said they have to change, that they shouldn
™t say that Jews killed Je sus, and other country 
are changing, but in Poland if you go to the ma ss, a
nd I went to the ma ss to 
hear it, they still are 
saying the same. 
Q: You said that you needed to go 
back. Wa s that for any reason --  
A: No -- 

Q: -- tied to the war, or anything? 

A: This was because -- you know, my husband was 
born in Kr aków, his whole fa-family is in -- 
in Kraków. He went through, he is Holocaust survi
vor, too. And it was few th
ings that he has to -
- to take care of. Yeah, a-at 
th -- this is why he -- we went
. But like I said, the country is 
beautiful.  

Q: So now, let™s go back to you living in Kraków
, and you were living there from about what age 
until what age?  How old are you at this point? 

A: I -- I live there from -- we came in ™45, March 
™45, and I left from Kraków to Israel in 1957, 
September 1957. So maybe -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
83 
 
Q: ™45, about -- 
A: -- for 12 years. 12 years, yeah, I went to -- 
t-to school there, I we
nt to -- you can call high 
school. I started my medical study in th
e University of k -- of Kraków.  
Q: Which was very unusual for a woma n, and a J e wish woma n, I would presume? 

A: They -- at that time, they didn™t ask you, b
ecause this is already 
communist governme nt, you 
don™t ask religion. Religion is not the subjec
t right now. If they
 don™t ask, you don™t say 
anything, but my friends, they knew 
that I am Jewish. They knew. 
Q: And was it unusual to be a woma n in
 dentistry school at that time there? 
A: I-In Poland, not. Eastern European, more woma
n, or equally maybe, or even more women in 
dentistry than men. The -- it wasn™t
 anything unusual. Yeah, wh-when we
 leave, I -- I -- I want to 
me ntion to you that in 1945 in May, we got a ne
ws from Gli wice because Socha escaped from 
Lvov after -- in ™45 to -- to
 Poland, too. He escape at -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. 
Kristine Keren. This is tape number four, side 
B. So you were telling me  about Socha and his 
dream to have a bar.  

A: Yeah, he -- he --  he dr-dreamed that after 
the war he will open -- he will have his own bar. 
And he moved to -- to Gliwice wh
ere Margolis live with his wife
, with Clara, because  Margolis 
and Clara they ge -- got ma rried, 
and th-they live in Gliwice for 
awhi -- while. Helena used to 
live in Gliwice, too. And we got 
a -- a news on May 13, it came  a telegram that Socha was killed. 
Q: What year was this? 

A: ™45.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
84 
 
Q: Oh, just ™45.  
A: May. 

Q: Just after the end of the entire war.  

A: Yeah, th-th-the war, yeah, na -- May na -- ni
ne, it was the end of the 
war. We  got a telegram 
that came  fr om Gliwice that Margolis send usthat Corsage died. It was in ma  -- May 1946, and it 

was shocking news. We  -- it was like some thing 
falling fr-fr-from the sky. And we w- went to the 
railroad station, we went to Gl-Gliwice, and h-he 
went to his home and to the funeral and he -- I -
- I -- I think going, you know, to the -- walking 
after th -- his -- what that™s called? 
Q: Oh, the casket -- 

A: The casket. 

Q: -- or the coffin. 

A: Coffin. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Walking a-after h- his c-coffin and seeing hi m on the ca-casket, it was the worst thing that 
happened to me . And it -- it was devastating for all 
of us. We  were -- he --
 he -- it was in a car 
ac-accident. He was riding the 
bicycle, and on the -- another bi
cycle was riding hi-his daughter. 
And in the front, approaching them from the fr 
-- opposite side was a army truck, a Russian army 
truck, and the driver was probably drunk, and Socha sa
w this and he s-start to pedal much faster, 
that he came  in front of his daughter, and in the 
last mo me nt the -- th-the truck hit him and not 
his daughter. And what is unbelievable, that hi
s blood was dripping through the ma nhole to the 
sewer. We  u -- we couldn™t believe it, and wh
en we were standing, you know, at the funeral in 
the cemetery, we heard that some body said, this 
is the -- the punishment from God for somebody 
who saved the Jews.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
85 
 
Q: Did you stay in contact with the others
 who were saved with you from the sewers? 
A: We  -- all of us were very close, especially --
 I have to say th -- especially Margolis, beca -- 
we felt, you know, like a fa mily. W- We, all those 
year til now, I am, you know, I -- in touch and 
I -- with their -- their children and with her 
-- their grandchildren. And i -- unfortunately 
Weinbergowa, who ma rried Haskell, they lived 
in Germany, and they b-both pass away. She was 
very sick. She s-suffered for depres
sion and it was a very difficult li
fe for her. And Helena, di -- 
she got ma rried and she lived in United States
, she has two children, 
and unfortunately she 
passed away, she had a heart attac
k. And my parents and my brother,
 they -- they lived in Israel. 
My brother lost his lif
e in Israeli army.  
Q: When did this happ
en, with your brother? 
A: It happen in 1978. He -- he was 39 years old, and 
he -- he -- he was killed. He -- he left a wife 
and two children. And my father passed away
 in 1975, and it was my mot her who has to go 
through this. And -- but, like always, sh-she was 
very strong woma n, and she live til her 90™s, 
and she pass a-away t -- in January 10, 2000. Fr
om those all 10 people -- from all those 10 
people who survive in the sewer for 14 months, 
and who survive Holocaust, I™m the only one 
who is still alive. And this is why I am telling 
the story, that I am the last eyewitness news. I 
witness that, saw this, we nt through this and can 
say that I saw this, not that some body told me .  
Q: And your father also wrote me
mo irs. How did that come  about? 
A: My father used to keep the me moirs i-in --  in
 the sewer, he -- he used
 to write, but a-after the 
war he wrote -- he had a -- wrote a -- a -- with 
his -- his handwriting me moirs and when he came  
to visit me  in the United States in 1975, w-w-we 
force him to put his -- in writing and to -- to 
write this on -- on the typewriter.
 And I -- I went with my hus ba
nd to lowe r east side, and we 
found old Polish typewriter, and we force my fath
er to sit and write it 
because we said, now you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
86 
 
don™t have any excuse, you have 
the typewriter, and type it. A
nd he wrote the m -- memoir, I 
have the manuscript of his me moirs, and this
 me moirs are from 1939 til 1945. And after he wrote 
the me moirs, when he went back to Israel with 
my mother, and a-after half a year he pass away. 
This was like his last docume nt that he put the 
all histor ical facts and mor -- everythi ng what 
happened to his family and the rest of j -- of the Jewish nation.  
Q: Have you rema ined in contact with Socha™s family? 

A: We were i-in contact with Socha™s fa mily, 
and a-after -- she died and n-now I am not in 
contact with the rest  of -- o-of the family becau
se his daughter, she -- sh-she felt that we did 
some thing wrong, that we said about him that he 
was a -- a -- a thief. And she is holding against 
us why we me ntioned this, but this was the truth, 
and this wa s very important truth, and the fact, 
and I don™t want to mi ss any -- any facts. This 
is, you know, historical event and everything has 
to be truth. The truth has to be 
said, but I didn™t -- don™t think th
at this is some thing negative. I 
think that he is the no -- the most p-positive fi gure 
that can exist, and -- f- for us, for the survivors 
and for the families of the survivor s, we always talk
 about him, and he is like, for us he  is like a 
angel, like si -- like you know, sent 
by saint, sent by God to save us.  
Q: Do you think your experiences during the Ho
locaust affected your thoughts about God? 
A: This is difficult question. I don™t know how to 
answer. I -- I am not religious, this mean -- I 
keep the tradition. I ke-ke -- the hol
y days, I can light the candle, 
I pray, I say the Kaddish for -- 
for my fa mi l y, for Socha. But my mi nd is very 
scientifical too, and t
hose are two -- two fields 
that are fighting either -- each ot
her. I really cannot say. But I think that so me how it is some  
power, bigger power th-that we 
are. I don™t know how -- how to ca
ll this. I don™t know even if 
Einstein know how to call this. But so me thi
ng must e-existed. I-I -- I really don™t know.

Q: And can you just then, finish telling me  you le
ft -- when did you -- your fa mily leave Poland, 
and -- and wa lk through a little bi
t of the chronology of the re
st of those years, you know. 
A: We  left Poland in 1957. It was a time that th
e Polish governme nt some how agreed to let some  
Jews to leave -- i-immi grate to Is
rael. And we i mmi grate to Israel, my mother had a si st er there, 
and th -- and her family and w-w-we -- we came to 
-- to Israel, we d -- live in Haifa. My -- I went 
to the kibbutz to -- to study Hebrew language, but
 I w-was in the kibbutz only for three weeks, 
because the s-study -- u-u-university 
started in October, and I wanted
 to continue my education. I 
was accepted to the Hebr ew Univers
ity, to the dental school, to th
e second year, and I continue 
my study. That wasn™t so easy, from the be
ginning because I didn™t know Hebrew, and no 
English, but I ma nage. And th-th-then I -- I g-
got ma rried. My husband 
was in the army, my 
brother was in the army. I -- my first son was bor
n in Israel. I graduate, I have my practice, 
private practice in Israel for 
seven years almost, and then in the 1968, my husband parents got 
the visa to United States, visa for which they 
were asking in 1945, in Kraków. They apply in 
1945, and they got this in 1968. And when we -- my 
parents-in-law didn™t want to emigrate from 
Israel, but they said, if we want, 
we can use this visa. We  went to
 the consulate and they told us 
if we will not use it, then we will lose it. The entrance permit to -- to United States, and we -- we 
said okay, we will try, and we plan to come for 
two years and from those two years is already 36. 
And I got my license here, and in 1970 I starte
d my own practice. I was teaching in n -- NYU, 
and then I started my own pract
ice that I de-develop, and my ol
der son, who was born in Israel, 
he -- he -- he was -- he went in 
my footsteps and he graduate fr
om Columbia University dent al 
school, he is a dentist. He  was practicing with me
 for 17 years, and now this practice is heres -- 
his, because I, after 46 years of
 -- of working, and bending my back, decided to retire. And here I 
am in the meantime, when we came to United St
ate, I have a-another son, and -- who didn™t go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

my footsteps, he -- he became a city planner, and he is working for an environmental p -- 
environmental position he has. And I have -- both
 are ma rried, I have two grandchildren, and I 
am happy. I -- right now i-in the -- the 208, i-i-
in spring, my -- I wrote a book, and the book will 
be publish in the spring in 208, about my experien
ce and my life, and living i-in the sewer and 
before and after, everyt hi ng will be  in the book, a
nd I hope that the future generation can read it 
and come  to conclusion that you have to fight 
for whatever you want, and n-not to give up.  
Q: Also, is your father™s me moirs av
ailable anywhere for people to read? 
A: My father™s me moir are not translated, they ar
e in Polish, and I am trying to tr-translate this 
because this is really a histor
ical docume nts. He puts the da te
s and the name s and everything in 
it. I would love to publish. Maybe after I publish 
my wa -- my book, I will try to find a transl ator, 
then can translate it and publish and give it to
 the museum. It is, I think, I™m not sure -- 
Q: Even a copy in Polish -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- mi ght, you mi ght want to put in the museum, right? 
A: I think it is. 

Q: Okay. We™ll check on that.  

A: I™m not sure. I know that they ask for it, but 
I don™t know. I wanted to give it them a copy, I 
didn™t want to give them the original. 

Q: Right, sure. Can you just -- 

A: Oh [indecipherable] yeah. 

Q: -- can you just describe to me , since we™ve talked
 about it, just give me 
a little description of 
the sweater from your grandmother. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520

A: It used to be green -- green 
color, and it™s like, around the ne
ck, it look like chanel, and it had 
a short sleeves, and a little ba -- 
bit, two strings in the front that
 you can close the -- th-the ne -- 
make a necktie. And this is the sweater that  I 
cherished the -- the most
, and when I show the 
sweater to my son -- sons, they were at -- in 
my house once and I show them, and they -- honest 
th-the y were so surprise, and I think what they
 said, Mom, you were so little. Because they 
couldn™t imagine that once is -- 
their mother was a child too, and 
the sweater is a reminder of it. 
The sweater I-I donated. First I wanted 
to keep it for my kids, but then they -- they said, Mom, i f 
we will keep it, nobody will see it.You better -- and I know that -- that the museum donated f -- 
asked for artifacts, I -- I give fe
w already, and the sweater I kept. And I ag -- ag -- agree, and I 
give the sweater to the wa -- Washington mu
seum. And it™s still th
ere, and it was on -- on 
exhibition, travel exhibition in Ne
w York, and I took my grandkids to see it, and they saw this, 
they couldn™t believe it, they said ma  -- Grandma, you were so little. But 
they were -- they were 
so proud. And right now the book that I want to pub
lish, it probably will be -- have the title of, 
The Girl in the Green Sweater.  

Q: I™m just curious, what is it a
bout this sweater? Is it the color,
 or just that your grandmother 
ma de it for you?  Is there anything in particular 
that ma de it so favorite, you know, such a favorite 
for you?   

A: I really don™t -- don™t know. I got so ma ny 
things, you know, fr-from my other grandmother 
that used to go to Vienna and bring me  so ma ny 
things. It ma y be because I saw my gr andmother 
knitting this for -- for me , and when I look at the 
sweater I see her face, I 
almost see her sitting 
and knitting. Maybe this was some
thing I -- it™s very diffi cult to ex
 -- explain, that it had such a 
value to me , and I was a little child, and 
still I knew how to evaluate things.

Q: I just have two more questions for you, and on
e is, I™m just amazed at -- at the level of your 
me mory. You know, your me mories are so deta
iled, it seems unusual. And you were so young. Is 
there anything that you can say about that or 
any thoughts that you have about having such 
detailed me mories of all these things? 
A: Usually everybody always said that I have ve
ry good me mory. It was in the school, and even 
when I used to give deposition the first time th
at I gave deposition, this
 was in the orphanage 
after the war, that I was [indecipherable]. A
nd I gave deposition in 1945, and the people with 
whom -- to whom I talk, they said oh, you reme
mber so good everything. But what I think why I 

reme mber so well, it is like a carve in my me
mor y, in my br-brain. Those are bad things and 
good things that you -- you brang pr
obably [indecipherable] and it 
stays with you. I can™t explain 
it. I -- even now when I went to -- after s -- I went to Lvov afte
r 60 years, and I recognize every 
building, ever -- every floor, every park. Wher
ever I went when I was a little child, I 
reme mbered. We  had the guide, and I was guidi
ng him how to go and where to go. He was 
amazed. He said, how can you reme mber those things
?  I-I a -- I don™t
 know. I s -- probably it got 
-- when you are getting so involved in some thing, it 
goes so deep in y-your me mory that it stays 
with you. And probably this had a su
ch impact on me, the things that
 I went through that is all -- 
always with me. I-I will never forg
et this. I-I live with this ever
y d-day to --  fr om one day to 
another. I live with my -- my story. 

Q: What are the most regular remi nders? Are they 
s-smells, or -- or noises?  What are the things, 
you know, that you live with every day in that se
nse?  What are the things that remi nd you?   

A: I-It™s -- it was -- you know, things that remi nds 
me , it is like you have -- you get a feedback s-
someti mes from a smell, fr-from a taste, from th-t
he noise. For example, when it start to rain I 
always -- I -- I always hear the rain, because I 
reme mber what happened w
ith the flood i-i-i-in

the sewer. Is so ma ny things that it -- suddenl
y can trigger your me mory a nd you go back. But 
the ya -- the whole life that the me mo ry is work
ing for me  til now, thank God, that I-I think it has 
a positive make-up --  po-positive fe eling fo-for me , and positive way for my life. It made me  
stronger and ma de me  look cleare
r, and made me be more caref
ul, more observant and more 
humane.  

Q: And did you talk much to your family about 
your experiences?  Your children as they were 
growing up? When did you start ta
lking about your experiences? 
A: The one thing that I have to tell are -- are 
about family -- my fa mily and people that we 
survive with, especially the -- the Margolis™s that
 we were in contact wi
th. We talk about our 
survival. We  tal-talked -- you know, in some  o
ccasions, some thing when we me- meet together, 

or some -- sometimes fr om nothing, someti mes that remi nd us something and we say oh, you 

reme mber this, oh you reme mber this. A-And --and some ti mes you know, some  jokes. I still 

reme mber the songs that we were
 singing, the jokes that th-th -- 
my father was telling. And i-i-i-
it was -- this is thanks to my parents, they 
-- they talk about it. I-I know that some Holocaust 
survivors didn™t like to talk about
 it. We talk and I th -- I th
ink it was much better. We  didn™t 
hold it in and we di -- among us. We didn't talk 
to anybody else, but a-among us. We -- we -- we 
live with this. 

Q: And whe n did you star
t talking to others? 
A: I start talking to others, it was after the 
documentary. This was done by BBC, and a fter child 
organiz -- Holocaust survivors, the children who 
survive Holocaust, they had a meeting, I think it 
was first me eting in ™89, in Marriott Hotel. And 
it was like 1600 Holocaust survivor children that 

survive came to this convention. And so ma ny 
people from media ca me, from all around the 
world and pe ople we -- we me t each other, we star
ted to talk and suddenly I felt free that I can 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0520  
92 
 
talk not only to my fa mily but to the other 
people. And then I was, you know, ma y a -- I-I di d a 
few interviews with the different newspapers
 all around the world, even to -- to German 
newspaper, to -- to Japanese newspaper. And I 
did -- I was invited to -- 
to schools and to other 
places to talk about this. And this is one thing 
that I really don™t like to do it, but I™m -- 
someti mes I™m doing because I™m looking from di
fferent point of view, I think that the young 
generation has to be educated, a
nd this is why I™m doing this. Is 
very painful, but from time to 
time I am doing this.  

Q: We ll, I appreciate you taking so
 much time to -- today to do this interview, and I wanted to 
just simply ma ke sure to ask you if -- if you feel
 that there™s anything th
at I ma y have left out 
that you wanted to -- that you wanted to me ntion. 

A: I -- I don™t think so. I think 
that you -- you were very, very 
precise with your -- writing your 
questions and you didn™t mi ss anything, I think. 

Q: We ll, thank you so much for doing th
is interview, real
ly appreciate it. 
A: Thank you for doing this with me .

Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Kristine
