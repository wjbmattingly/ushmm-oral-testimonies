Q: Today is March 25, 1992, I™mAnthony Di Iorio.  
I™m at the home of Ellen Mendel and I™m here 
on behalf of the United St ates Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview her about her 

recollections of the Holocaust and about the ef
fects of the Holocaust on her fa mily.  Before 
beginning I should probably me ntion 
that Ellen had some surgery th
is morning as a result of an 
accident  on her foot but as a great trouper and 
academician she has decide d to go ahead with 
this interview even though it is
 a beautiful day here in Ne
wYork City.  Hello Ellen.  
 

A: Hi,Tony. 

 

Q: How™re you doing? 

 

A: Great.  Enjoying this a lot. 

 

Q: You™reenjoying 
a broken toe a lot. 
 

A: I appreciate the opportunity of
 talking to you about my fa mily. 
 
Q: Okay.  I™m going to ask you to go back in time
, forgetting about feet and the nice weather and 
take us back to Germany when you were a little
 girl growing up.  First of all where were you 
born in Germany?  
 
A: I was born in Essen. 

 

Q: And your birthday? 

 

A: September 22, 1935. 

 

Q: Yourparents? 

 

A: Myparents™name s?  

 

Q: Ye s. 

 

A: My father, his name  was  Ernst and my mother
 was Jella Mendel. That™s  how we pronounced it 
in Germany.   He was a physician. 
 

Q: Your father was a physician? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: In Germany.   In Esssen?  
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Andyourmother? 

 

A: She was a housewife. 

 

Q: Now what me mories do you have, if any, of growing up in Essen? 

 

A: Okay, what I™ll tell you about is what 
I reme mbe r  and also what I was told. 
 

Q: Wa s told by your parents? 

 

A: Right. An interesting fact 
is that I was born one week afte
r the Nurembe rg laws came out.  
They came out September 16.  I was born a week late
r. And at that point Jews were not allowed 
to have anybody working in their house who we
re Christians unless they were over fifty 

because the Nazis were afraid th
at they would intermarry or– 
 

Q: HankyPanky? 

 

A: Right. And so my earliest days -- you know 
I had a nursema id that they had to let go and I 
know my mother explained how 
sad that occasion was so they
 had to let her go of this 
nursema id and they changed several time s. Ther
e was Shvesta Gatzog or Shvesta Maria.  So I 
think I got Shvesta Maria.  She was over fifty so
 that was okay.  She was nice too but from my 
earliest years were kind of changing caretakers.  
There was, of course, my mother but I think 
she felt it would be good to have a nu
rsemaid for me in those early years. 
 

Q: So your nursema ids were 
all elderlyAryan women? 
 

A: Right and they were very lovely people 
and my parents got along very we ll with them. 
 

Q: We re there other non-Jewi
sh people in the household? 

 

A: What I want to say is that I think Shvest
a Roiskin,, Shvesta Gatzog, 
Shvesta Roiskin, Shvesta 
Maria -- Shvesta Roiskin ma de them–..They al
so could have some body Jewish so maybe one 
of them was  Jewish.  If you had someone who was 
Jewish they could be that age.  But I am 
aware that there was a lot of change in the begi nning because even though the Nuremberg laws 

came out -- until they came to the people -- you know
, a little time must have gone by, there was 
a lot of confusion. And then my mother used to
 say that new edicts w
ould appear like a bolt of 
lightning out of the air overnight. You never 
knew what was going to happen next, where the 
Jews couldn™t  go, what they had to do or what 
they couldn™t do.  So my parents, for example, 
were married at home because that was easier. 
 

Q: When were they ma rried? 

 

A: And they didn™t go on vacation in Ge rmany on their honeymoon because that was already was 
closed off as far as I recollect so they went 
to Italy on their honeymoon. They got ma rried in 
1934. 

 
Q: So the Nazis had been in 
power for more than a year? 
 

A: Right.  On my birth certif
icate also there™s a swastika. 
 

Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters? 

 

A: No.  My father said because of 
the situation we couldn™t afford it. 
 

Q: Wa s he able to cont
inue practicing me dicine? 
 

A: Well that™s an interesting story --  because 
he served in the FirstWorldWa r and had been 
decorated for distinguished servicethe army kind of was able to pr
otect their own as it were and 
Hitler couldn™t  do very much.  So he was allowe d 
to practice for a very, very long time  and he 

was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and 
that then things would be better.  So we 
stayed in Germany until 1939 which isn™t to say th
at we didn™t want to leave earlier. After 
Kristallnacht I don™t think any Jews had any doubt
 of what was going to be the mood of the 

country.  I wouldn™t say the fate of all Jews b
ecause it wasn™t  known at that time.  So during 
Kristallnacht , for example, I was in Essen alone w
ith my grandfather, my  father ™s father, while 
they were getting ready in Ber
lin, they bought all this furnitur
e that you see here, they bought 
all of that and they got ready to
 emigrate. And I would always be
 left with different people, my 
grandfather in Essen or my
 grandparents in Heidelberg
 while they would leave. 
 

Q: So your grandfather in Essen, would that
 be on your father ™s side of the fa mily? 
 

A: Right. 
 
Q: Your grandparents in Heidelberg 
on your mother ™s side of the fa mily? 
 

A: One of the stories that is told, that my father to
ld me  is that when I was a toddler we were in the 
trolley car and there were a lot of me n with thei r 
swastikas and we were si
tting there.  My father 
was trying to keep a very low profile and me  be
ing this curious little kid I started asking all 
about those signs that I was seei
ng.  In a loud voice Papa [vas iss dos] and my father tried to 
explain very quietly so that I wouldn™t  cau
se a commotion and nobody would notice us. And I 
said [very indistinct] and I just kept on and on 
and he wasn™t  able to let me  know enough that I 
had to keep quiet.  So finally he took me  and we
 got out of the trolley car because  he was afraid 
that we would get in trouble.  My father was 
also in a concentration camp, in Dachau.  In the 
early days the Nazis were imprisoning a lot of pe
ople and it seems to me from what he told me 
he was put in because he was vice-president of th
e B™nai Brith chapter.  So they were ransoming 
until they got all the money he was there.  So 
he was there maybe two days or something like 
that.  But he was in 
a concentration camp. 
 

Q: Two days in Dachau? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And this was to extort money? 

 

A: Right. 

 
Q: So the fact that he was a war vetera
n and a physician didn™t ma ke any difference? 
 

A: At that point it didn™t ma tter anymore. At that
 point Hitler had taken over the army. And so the 
army was powerless. 
 

Q: Wa s this after you were born this happened or before? 

 

A: Oh, after. It was after Krista
llnacht I guess.  Oh yeah, that wa
s just before the–probably ™38 or 
some thing like that 
 

Q: Was he still practicing 
medicine at that time? 

 

A: No, he had to stop at some  point. There 
was one point where ever
ybody had to stop who was 
Jewish. At that point he said if I can™t ma ke my
 livelihood then I can™t  live here. At that™s  when 
he started to get rea
dy and to find out how to get out, wh
ere we could go, who would give us 
the affidavit, and these must have been extremely 
stressful times. As far as my life before that  I 
came fr om very comfortable milieu.  My parent
s™ fa milies on both sides had lived in Germany 
since about the 1700s. We  were very comfortable and my life was a very good one. An 

interesting story is told that peopl
e like my -- once my mother told 
the story that if my father --- 
this couldn™t happen in the Holocaust though---he wa
s so prominent, two things, first he walked 

into a store likeWoolworth, or 
some  kind of a low class store,
 people were overheard to say 
well -- Dr. Mendel–[in German] if he goes in we 
could also go.  But more directly, when my 

parents were getting ready for 
the emigration it was around the tim
e of Kr istallnacht and they 
were in Berlin and I was alone in Essen with my 
grandfather. When they called they were told 
don™t come  back, stay where you are. You won™t be
 recognized in Berlin, in Essen you™re too 
well known. 
 
Q: So your grandparents to
ld your parents that–.. 
 

A: I think some body called the house and spoke to 
my grandfather.  My grandfather was very 
prominent in Essen, not only my grandfather but
 his brother had a huge practice my fa ther 
inherited.  He  ma de some discoveries with di
abetes.  He was very 
well known––[indistinct]  
But he died. 
 

Q: This would have been your father ™s  uncle?   

 

A: Ye s, Uncle Felix.  My fathercalled him Uncle Felix.  He was my
 great-uncle.  So they stayed 
longer and my father treated people from the Krupp 
fa mily and so they helped also and from the 
packing they gave him favors because 1) 
he was well liked 2) he was well known. 
 

Q: So you™re saying Krupp, people from Krupp he
lped your father during the emigration? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah, right.  I mean we 
got everything out. All into ou
r [indistinct] and everything and 
most of it seemed to come from here. 
 

Q: Did your parents own thei
r own place or were they– 
 

A: No, I went back there 
and they were renting. 

 
Q: Apartment building or a house? 

 

A: Like a big apartment. 

 

Q: Now you mentioned you were w
ith your grandparents at one poi
nt.  Did they live with you or 
was it just you and your parents? 
 

A: No, this was in Heidelberg. 

 

Q: Oh, so you stayed in Heidelberg? 

 

A: Yeah, my pa rents would park me  there and 
I would be with my grandparents but you know I™ve 
been in therapy and some of the stuff that™s co
me  out you know in the last ten years even would 
say is that on some  people I was afraid th
ey were never gonna come  back and that they 
wouldn™t take  me .  So today certain reactions to 
things go all the way back to that time when I 
was left with wonderful grandparents but
 all I wa nted to do was in a garden– 
 

Q: This was in Heidelberg? 

 

A: Yeah, all I wanted to do was go home. 

 

Q: Home meaning to Essen. 

 

A: With my par ents–I just wanted my parents. 

 
Q: So would you say you were growing up half the tim
e in Heidelberg and half the time in Essen? 
 
A: No, I think most of the time  I was in Essen but
 then when my parents would get ready for a few 
weeks I would stay for a time–Moving ahead –.
[i ndistinct] well that ™s so me of what I 
reme mber when I was growing up. 
 

Q: So you reme mber seeing any other Nazis besides 
the ones on trolley car that
 day?  That was the 
first time  you had seen a swastika? 
 

A: That was the first time  I responded out loud, so openly. 

 

Q: Did your father ever explain af
terwards what the swastika meant? 
 

A: Nobody ever explained anything 
to me  and so I came to this 
country, I wa s a very confused 
little child.  I had ma ny fears and once I found out
 in a big, long workshop that I thought that 
everything that ever happened that was wrong was 
my fault. That any problems my pa rents had 
you know I just [? ] had this feeling that I was 
always doing the wrong thing so everything must 
have been my fault.  Nobody really ever talked 
to me about it because they didn™t think I would 
understand. 
 

Q: So not even afterwards di d they explain?  

 

A: No, not when I was a child. You know I™d be mu
ch older before they ex
plained anything. Then 

my father spoke.  I can tell you what he did. We  
were only allowed to take out ten dollars, the 
equivalent of ten dollars. 
 
Q: When you left Ger many? 

 

A: When we left Germany and my father knew that
 it would be hard for us to get started and he 
couldn™t be a physician right away
.  So he took toothpaste out of
 toothpaste containers with 
gloves, no well he squeezed it out 
with gloves and put in money w
ith tweezers and then he sent 
it –. [indistinct].  I™m not sure 
if he ever got the money but– 
 

Q: Got it out of Germany?  

 

A: Right, and there were always these obstacles.  
Even when we were in Belgium we almost didn™t 
get out.  Many times we almost didn™t ma ke it. At one point though in terms of Ger many my 

father didn™t want to wait any longer in Germ
any because he saw what
 was happening and so 
we emigrated to Belgium. 
 

Q: When did this happen? 

 

A: We  left in May ™39. And we were in
 Belgium, in Brusse
ls until January 1940. 
 

Q: Just the three of you? 

 

A: Yeah, just wa iting for our number to come  up. 

 

Q: So you were waiting for visas toAmerica? 
 
A: Right, yeah, the affidavit, the folder [? ], the visa, the whole thing. 

 

Q: And your grandparents in Heidel
berg, did they rema in behind? 

 

A: My grandparents in Heidelber
g, at some  point, pr obably before 
we left Ge rmany, because we 
were in Essen, well they were still there Kris
tall –I™m not sure if they were still ther e 
Kristallnacht . 
 

Q: Yourgrandparents? 

 

A: My grandparents in Heidelberg.  But I know
 I was with my grandfather in Essen at 
Kristallnacht , but I don™t know if that was because they left. 
 

Q: Your grandfather Mendel, 
that would be Nove mb er 1938. 
 

A: Right.  I think ma ybe in ™37 they ma y have left. 
They left, let™s see, I™ll tell you who all left.  
My grandparents left either ar
ound Kristallnacht or before.  
I have a sense it was before. 
 

Q: These would be your mother ™s  parents? 

 

A: My mother ™s  parents. 

 

Q: This would be the Hocher. 
 

A: The Hocher part of the fa mily, right. They le
ft and his brother left 
and his wife, Uncle Simon, 
that™s with hi s wife . 
 

Q: Grandpa Ferdinand and his wife 
and his brother Simon and his wife. 

 

A: Right, and family actually. And their whole fami ly. We nt toAmsterdam.  

 

Q: So the Hochers went toAmsterdam.  

 

A: Yeah, them anyway. There were a lot more.  
Because they were in th
e cigar business and they 
had connections in Holland because they imported 
from Holland.  So in order to get away from 
Hitler they went to Holland assumi
ng that they would be okay. At 
least that was the fi rst leg of 
the journey. And also my mother ™s sister a
nd her fa mily, her husband and her child.  He was 
three years old in Holland –he was born a
bout 1937 –.no, he was born in Holland, I think.  
Yeah, my cousin was born in Ho
lland, yeah I think in ™37. 
 

Q: This would be your aunt Erica?   

 

A: Yeah,right. 

 

Q: And they went around the same
 time that your grandparents – 
 

A: Right, they all went toAmsterdam.  They 
lived in different houses in the same  part of 
Amsterdam because I saw it when I was there. 
 

Q: But when you left Germa ny, you went to Belgium. 

 

A: To Brussels, right. 

 

Q: Completely independently of thei
r movement. You didn™t visit them. 
 

A: Right I think it™s because my father had a cous
in in Belgium and we were going to live with 
them.  Right, I think we sort of lived in their bu
ilding. Their name  was Rose, right. Alex, that™s 
right, I played with their son. And my father wa
sn™t  really -- it was dangerous for Jewish me n 
to go out on the street at night.  
It wasn™t  really a curfew.  So
 he didn™t go out that muc h.  I 
know I wasn™t  easy there either. And I went to a 
parochial school.  I went to a Catholic nursery 
school.  
 

Q: You were too young to go to school in Germany?  

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Did you start learning anothe
r language at that point? 
 

A: Ye s, I learned French, Belgian Fr ench. 

 

Q: When you left Ger many, were you able to 
say good-bye, do you reme mber saying good-bye to 

any fa mily me mbers at that point?   Di
d you know you were really leaving for good? 
 
A: It was really sad.  I don™t know.  My father must have said good-bye to his father [indistinct].  I 
guess we said good-bye but 
I don™t reme mber good-byes. 
 

Q: You were glad they were taking you with them, though? 

 

A: Yeah, my ea rliest me mory which was in German
y is that we™re leaving and walking out of the 
house and as I turn around I guess a door ™s  ope
n and I see the workme n starting to ma ke 
changes in the apartment and my attitude as 
I™m walking forward is why couldn™t they have 
waited till we left  to st art turning things upside 
down.  On some level I was aware.  I wa s really 
aware on some  level of what was going on but it 
wasn™t  anything my parents could speak t me  
about.  So it was some thing I just felt.        

  
 

Q: Did you have any playma tes in Essen? 

 

A: I had playma tes, I don™t  reme mber about my 
playma tes in Essen.  I did but no hard and fast 
ones.  Maybe it had to do with th
e time s. When we got to Bru
ssels because I went to nursery 
school, I di d play with this boyAlex in the building because he had a dog. 
 

Q: Did you have any pets speaking of dogs? 

 

A: No, I always wanted a pet.We  could never have one. 

 

Q; No pets.Any dolls, any –? 
 
A: Oh yes, I had a doll.  I have a picture some wh
ere if I could dig that up where I™m looking out of 
the window and I have my doll. A
nd my grandparents gave it to me . 
 

Q: You got to keep the doll? 

 

A: I kept my doll. 

 

Q: From your grandparents from Heidelberg? 

 

A: FromHeidelberg. 

 

Q: So the doll was fr om Heidelberg? 

 

A: Right, from those ..yeah, yeah.Then 
I had a great grandf
ather –.[indistinct] 
 

Q: What kind of a doll was it –? 

 

A: Yeah, very cute.  It had blond hair.  It had eyes
 that opened and shut, I be
lieve, I won™t swear to 
it. What I reme mber is it had a cape.  It ha
d a beautiful velvet cape with ma roon on the collar 
part. And hair and I used to hold her very tightly
 –[indistinct] and so I got one inAmerica, my 
first doll inAmerica, I reme mber that also.  
I had three dolls, I had that doll and I had one 
name d Kita. Those were German dolls, they were 
celluloid. And that had 
hair stuck on.  I also 

had a boy doll, his name was Peter. 
 
Q: What was the girl™s  name ?   Do you reme mber that?   She got up to go to the U.S.? 

 

A: It was a very good doll ––––[indistinct] 

 

Q: The blond with the ma roon cape, she ma de it to the U.S.? 

 

A: Yeah, I think so. 

 

Q: And that was the end of her career? 

 

A: I think so, either that or  she got lost  so me wh
ere in the shuffle because I don™t reme mber that  
part. 
 

Q: Do you have any other me mories of Brussels? 

 

A: Oh, yeah, Brussels I remember sitting on th
e kitchen table because 
I ha d been naughty or 
some thing or else they we re cleaning, I can™t  re
me mber which. Anyway everything is out of the 
kitchen.  I™m sitting in the mi ddle of the tabl e and I™m saying my catechism in French. 
 

Q: You were saying catechism in French?    [She says some  of it]. 

 

A: That™sWednesday night I reme mber. 

 

Q: Now you we re a Jewish girl
 though with Jewish parents. 
 

A: Yeah, but I went to –I had a 
little apron and a little slate, ye
ah my mother made me a little 
apron.  My mother ma de all my clothes.  On
e she was very handy and two we didn™t have any 
money.  So I reme mber that and I reme mber that 
experience. And then my father tells us that 
we used to go to the beach in the summe r. We ll, we didn™t used to I guess we were there one 

summer. We  went to [? ]. And my father tells th
e story that he was lying 
there and all at once he 
hears these people laughing. And he looks up a
nd he sees that I am walking on the beach 
following a little dog, a little ma le dog and I am 
imitating a little dog urinating, putting my leg 
up and trying to urinate with my leg up. 
 

Q: This is the pet that you wished you had. 

 

A: I guess so because I always wanted a dog, a pet. 
 So he was embarrassed.  It seems as if I was 
always embarrassing my parents ––[indistinct]. 
 

Q: So you were a mi schievous child? 

 

A: I think I was, yeah.  My fath
er used to call me  ﬁstrolth.ﬂ 
 

Q: What™s  that supposed to mean?  

 

A: Like a little imp.  I think that™s 
what it means.  I have to look it up. 
 

Q: And you didn™t have any other nick
name s?  You were Ellen otherwise? 
 

A: Called me devil, little devil. 

 

Q: What did you ever do to earn that? 

 

A: InAmerica I was alwa
ys getting into trouble. 
 

Q: But in Germany you didn™t  get into trouble did you? 

 

A: No, there they called me  Sonnenscheinkind. 

 

Q: Oh, well everybody knows what that means. 

 

A: Yeah, –.[indistinct] sunshine. 

 

Q: So in Germa ny you were St rolth and Zonnascheinkind? 

 

A: I™m not sure I was St rolth later on.  I was mu
ch loved and muc h looked after and focused on.  
There were pros and cons to that.  I was an 
only child. And I have a book about every word I 
ever spoke and what I ate and how much I weighed –. 
 

Q: Did you know that you were Jewish? 

 

A: No.  I knew I was Jewish when we came here 
because my father was a very loyal me mber of 
the synagogue and the rabbi from Essen founded a 
synagogue here. We  came a year after they 
founded it. They founded it a year after Kristalln
acht.. We  weren™t here yet, Novembe r  in 
1939. We  c a me  in 1940 ––[indistinct]. 
 

Q: So one of the rabbis of Essen founded anot
her synagogue in NewYork in Nove mber 1939? 

 

A: Called the Builders, Habonim.  

 

Q: Builders Synagogue, right here in NewYork City. 

 

A: Sort of an answer to the 
–that we wouldn™
t be left out. 
 

Q: Meanwhile had you ever heard of Hitler?   I 
know your first experience 
with the swastika was 
on the trolley car. Wa s the name  Hitler ever me ntioned, do you recall talk of Hitler or  of war, 

because after all war has broken out during these months? 
 

A: My parents were the kind of people who woul
d want to shelter their children from eve r ything, 
any harm. And that happened until my father died
 last spring. Their at
titude always was we 
want to shelter Ellen, we want to protect her, we
 don™t want her to worry.  So I think they ma de 
very sure never to discuss anything contr
oversial or fearful or
 [indistinct] around me . 
[i ndi st i nct ] 
 

Q: Did they ever give you a reason why you were 
moving to Belgium and then eventually moving 
across the ocean? 

 
A: No, I wish they had.  Let me  just go back.  
This was a story my father told over ma ny, ma ny, 
ma ny ti me s.  My grandparents Hocher would have
 liked to have come  toAmerica and planned 

to.  But it wa s a question of getti
ng the papers together and ever
ything. And they said to my 
father and my mother, my father was always the spokesman for the family, why don™t you leave 

Ellen with us inAmsterdam?  And you™ll be free to
 settle and get yourself together because after 
all it™s not easy with a little 
girl and you don™t know what awaits
 you? And then we™ll bring 
Ellen with us .  No my fa ther said no, no.  No
 matter how bad things are there always will be 

enough for Ellen. Wher ever we go Ellen will go w
ith us. There will always be enough. And so 
we finally got out January 1940.  May 10
th
 was the invasion and all borders were closed.  So the 
fact that I™m here talking to you is a double mi racl
e, ma ybe a triple one.  One is that my father 
didn™t say yeah that mi ght be a good idea, let™s do
 that and then I would 
have been killed with 
my grandparents probably in Sobibor or elsewh
ere because I would have been too young to 
useful. The second is that our number came up befo
re the invasion.  It was just luck. We  could 

have been sitting there and it could have been July
 and we mi ght still not have our number.  So 
that™s a clear-cut two. 
 

Q: And what™s  your ma ybe third one? 

 

A: I just ma de it up because I like three.  Oh th
ree. We  went through theAtlantic Ocean and it was 
mi ned. That  was the last voyage of theVa n 
Dank the boat we  came  on.  It was torpedoed, 
mi ned, sunk on it™s return voyage. 
 

Q: TheVa n? 

 

A: TheVa nDa nk. 
 
Q: Dutchship? 

 

A: Yeah, Dutch ship. We  sailed from [? ] 

 

Q: Du, no Da which sa
nk on it™s return.  
 

A: 1940 going back.  So that™s  three,
  but you thought of another one. 

 

Q: We ll not another one but what struck me  was 
that you™d always been af
raid that your parents 
would leave you behind and yet here your father
 had this golden opportunity to leave you 
behind and yet he said no and you weren™t ther
e to hear this.  If
 you™d only heard this 
conversation then, there all of your worries and 
your concerns probably w
ould have evaporated. 
 

A: Yeah, yeah, because a lot of my me mories fr
om Holland was I™m supposed to take  a bath and 
go to bed. And I decide I don™t want to take a ba
th but I don™t want any
one to get angry at me  
so I get undressed, I have the bath water drawn 
and I™m standing there but I figure if I don™t put 
my foot in the water I™ll never ha
ve to take the bath and I won™t have to go to bed and then my 

parents won™t leave me  in the middle of the 
night while I™m sleeping and never come  back. 
 

Q: Ve ryelabor ate. 

 

A: That was quite a story. 

 
Q: Yeah, now while you were in Belgium, ™39, early
 ™40, did you ever get a chance to visit family 
me mbers in Holland? 
 

A: No, but what we did, that™s  a good question, be
fore we left we stayed two weeks with my 
grandparents and it was at that time  all the good-bye
s, all the plans, and 
that™s when I was so 
afraid my pa rents would leav
e. We lived with them. 
 

Q: Which grandparents now? 

 

A: Holcherr. 

 

Q: O.K, so this was in the Ne therlands? 

 

A: InAmsterdam, by then they were there because they had gone in ™37 or ™38. 

 

Q: Before leaving you guys go to live inAmsterdam – 

 

A: To live for two weeks. 

 

Q: Wa s this January or December? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: You were there with your grandparents, the 
very same  grandparents who wanted to keep you. 
 
A: Right.  It ma y have been at that time  when th
at conversation came  up.  It was at that time I was 
fearful of taking a bath because I thought my pa re
nts would leave and never come  back. And at 
that time I guess that™s when we said our good-byes. 
 
Q: Do you remember saying good-bye to those grandparents? 

 

A: No, I don™t think I reme mber. 

 

Q: Wa s there any possibility of them le aving sincethey indicated they wanted to go toAmerica as 
well? 
 

A: Yeah, there was and I guess their number didn™
t come  up or they didn™t have anybody at that 
moment inAmsterdam but it seemed immi nent almost. 
 

Q: So there was paperwork? 

 

A: Possibly, I don™t know at what stage it was. 

 

Q: How about the other me mbers of the fa mily?  
You me ntioned your aunt Er ica, your mother ™s  
youngest sister? 
 

A: They stayed. They weren™t planning on going toAmerica. 

 

Q: Did anyone suspect 
that Germany mi ght – 
 
A: And my aunt,Ta nta Simon they weren™t planni
ng that I know of to come toAmerica either. 
 

Q: They were in the Netherlands? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And they were continuing the same  line of work, they have the cigar – 

 

A: Right until the Germans – 

 

Q: Did anyone suspect that the Germans mi ght
 invade Holland which was a neutral country? 
 

A: I don™t think anyone did. 

 

Q: Nobody thought about it. 

 

A: I don™t think people thought about these things
.  My father wouldn™t go to Holland because he 
was a doctor and he didn™t  have any connections
 there.  So we  had some  connections in 
America so we figured – somehow my father didn™
t want to stay around because there was talk 
ofAustralia if we couldn™t get intoAmerica. Th
at was a possibility, to go toAustralia.  Never 
wanted to go to Palestine. 
 

Q: After the fact, did he ever share with you hi
s thoughts about -- reme mb
er you were telling me  
that being Jewish and talking about
 Nazis and Hitler that
 was saved for much later.  Eventually 
when your father came around to telling you about 
these years including the decision to leave 
Germany, di d he add any additional infor mation? 
 

A: It was my mother who said how things 
happened overnight.  My father had tremendous 
ambivalence about leaving Germany.  Germany 
had been a source of success, friendship and 

ma ny things. And when we came here he says
 [spoken in German] which means we got to 
thank God every day that he brought 
us to this God damn country.  
 

Q: Meaning the United St ates ofAmerica. 

 

A: Right.  And I used to hear in the beginni
ng years after that how wonderful Germany was. 
 

Q: Before the Nazis came. 

 

A: Right.  So my father used to live in his storie
s to me  more in what  happened before the Nazis 
except for his overcoming.  He never shared fee
lings vulnerable.  He never shared feeling 
Jewish, never talked about stuff like this, nothing. 
All he said is they 
thought he was a ma d ma n 
and he would burn hims elf out. 
 

Q: You™re talking about Hitler? 

 

A: Hitler, yeah.  He really fe
lt that he could outlive Hitler. 
 

Q: And he did, but only because he left. 
 

A: He was right, but only because he 
left. And he was very reluctant 
to leave. All he did was save 
us. We  don™t fight the language.  He ma de me  sp
eak German.  I™m bilingual.  He said we™re not 
fighting the language, just the people. And he us
ed to talk about [in German].  So you had a 
sense of who was good and who wasn™t  good. 
 

Q: So it wasn™t  the people even, it wa
s some  people bad and some people good. 
 

A: Right. And he spoke about some times about 
friends who hadn™t survived, people he wa s very 
close to who were very successful, I guess. But 
that was the irony of so
me people [indistinct] 
that their country would turn on 
them.  So my fat her thought [indi
stinct].  Just my mo ther who 
said overnight you never kne
w what was happening next. 
 

Q: Would you say that your mother was more
 eager to leave than your father was? 
 

A: Well, you see my father ™s father was still in
 Germany and my mother ™s  parents had gone to 
Holland so in a way perhaps but I think they bo
th had really decided. The mi nute my  father 
couldn™t practice me dicine he resolved to leave.
 And he also said ma ny years later he would 
never go back to a country that had thrown him out.  Never go to visit. 
 

Q: Even though it had been such 
a great place before the Nazis. 

 

A: Right.  No, his father kind of died
 right before the war. [indistinct] 
 

Q: Did you find out what happened to the othe
r me mbers of your fa mily who didn™t leave? 
 

A: For a long time we didn™t know anything.  
I reme mber one day my mother found out 
[indistinct].  I™m not even sure if she cried. 
 I don™t  reme mber my pa
rents crying for anything 
that ever happened.  I only reme mb er my mothe r
 maybe a little bit she 
cried when her parents 
were killed, but not a big cr
y –– [indistinct] maybe she crie
d but nothing long lasting.  I 
reme mber though once she found out -- late, because I must have been about ten years old. 
 

Q: And what did happen? 

 

A: We ll, they we re put on cattle cars and I f
ound out from my a unt, I thought they were shot 
getting off t he cattle cars, but to speak to my au
nt she told me  they we
nt to Sobibor and they 
perished there. 
 

Q: Yourmother ™s..? 

 

A: Parents.  Ferdinand and Eva Holchherr. 

 

Q: Eva being her stepmother? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: So it would be your grandfather 
Holchherr and your step-grandmother. 
 

A: Right and the only one that I ever knew. 
 

Q: And they were deported from the Netherlands di
rectly fromAmsterda m or were they sent to 
any camps –? 
 

A: No, I think they were sent 
to Sobibor. Where is that? 
 

Q: That™s  in eastern Poland.  It was an exterm
ination camp that was active in ™42 and ™43.And you 
don™t recall the date that this happened –.? 
 

A: They mi ght know [indistinct] 

 

Q: So your grandparents we re deported together.  
We re there any other me mbers of the family that 
were with them in the cattle cars? 
 

A: We ll you seeTa nta Ella and 
Uncle Simon were [indistinct] 
 

Q: First your grandparents, they were sent dir
ectly to Sobibor from the Netherlands.  Now you 
were starting to talk about your grandfather ™s brother. 
 

A: Right, Simo n, who [? ? ] in a cigar factory together
 and they we re very close.  He had a son from 
his first wife.  His name  was Heinz Holchherr – so, let me  get the family group. There was 

Simon and his second wife Ella.  Her name  used to be Lizer but now of course when they got 

ma rried so that was Holchherr. They had two children.  One was Heinz who was fr om his first 

wife. 
 
Q: Right. Whose mother died when he was young. 
 

A: Right.  Sometime around a little before the first 
WorldWa r. And his father was very prominent 
in the fi rstWorldWar. 
 

Q: This would be Simon.  He was a war veteran of the German army. 

 

A: Right.  He had a big scar– [indistinct] 

 

Q: From the wa r or from fraternity. 

 

A: No, from the war.  He and his wife had anothe
r child.  Her name  was Lisa Lotte. They were all 
living in Holland but then Lisa Lo
tte went to England to study to 
be an interpreter. And Heinz 
eventually in those years got ma rried.  He 
got married to some one na me d [indistinct]. 
 

Q: Germanwo ma n?  

 

A: Germanwo ma n.  

 

Q Also living in the Netherlands? 

 

A: Yeah, I believe that was the story.  Pretty popular. 

 

Q: Jewish? 
 

A: Yeah, Jewish.  Now I won™t swear that he di
dn™t get ma rried in Germany and come  there with 
his wife.  I™m not positive but I could find out 
for you.  But they had a child who was about a 

year younger than I, ma ybe she would have been, or
 a year and a half younger, about that age.  
And Lisa Lotte was studying in E
ngland to be an interpreter. 
 

Q: This was Heinz™s half sister? 

 

A: Right, Ella™s daughter, came  back to visit 
her parents and was trapped -- couldn™t go back. 
 

Q: She came ba ck when to visit her parents? 

 

A: Before you could get out again. 

 

Q: Was it after you had left forAmerica? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: So we™re talking early 1940. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And bang, the Germans come in. 

 

A: Right, and she™s stuc k, she can™t  go back to England.  Because she was their daughter, she was 
just studying there and she didn™t have a right to 
be out there.  She was there at the wrong time.  
So she was stuck with them. 
 

Q: And they all have Germa n passports? 

 

A: Either German or Dutch, but 
it di dn™t ma tter, they were Jewish. 
 

Q: Right, I mean they would only have been living 
in the Netherlands for a year or two so Lisa 
Lotte for example really wasn™t  living in the Netherlands.  In all pr obability thei r passports were 

German.Wi th a J on it. 
 

Q: Probably. Yeah they defi nitely had the J on it 
because we had that too.  So she was stuck there 
and she and Heinz and Heinz™s wife and then th
ere was a little daughter.They were asking for 
young people to go to the work camps. 
 

Q: Who™sthey? 

 

A: The Germans were asking for na me s of peopl
e to volunteer to go and – you know things were 
bad in Holland for the Jews, inAmsterdam by that time .  I don™t know what time .  I don™t know 

if my grandparents were stil
l there but around 
those years. 
 

Q: During the German occ upation? 

 

A: Oh, for sure. And Si mon thought that things coul
d be a little better for th
em.  So he encouraged 
them to volunteer to be in a labor camp to 
work, young people, in Germany. And they never 
came back. 
 
Q: So he encouraged Lisa Lotte and Heinz. 

 

A: Probably Margo went too, not positive. 

 

Q: Heinz™swife. 

 

A: Heinz™s wife.  Now the little daughter, I™m not positive.  Her na me  was Suzanne.  I don™t know 
where she was killed. The parent s, I™m not even
 sure  who went toTheresienstadt butTa nta 
Ella, Simon™s wife and uncle Simon 
were deported toTheresienstadt. 
 

Q: Alone. 

 

A: To the best of my under standing, but I™m not positive.
  Maybe the little girl 
went  too, their little 
granddaughter, I don™t know.  BecauseTa nta Ella survived the war because she came to live 

with me  in 1946. 
 

Q: So Jella survived deportation toTheresienstadt? 

 

A: No, Jella was my mother, Ella?   Ella went 
toTheresienstadt suffered tremendously.  Her 
husband was deported fromThereienstadt toAusc
hwitz and killed. A 
lot of people in our 

fa mily went toAuschwitz, name s I haven™t me
ntioned to you. There were ma ny brothers.  
There was Simon and Fe rdinand and ma ny others 
and a lot of them were deported because only 
two people came  back,Ta nta Ella andTa nta Marie. 
 

Q: Ella rema ined inTheresienstadt until the end of the war? 

 

A: And she was liberated and then I guess she was in a DP camp and then she went back to 
Holland a little bit and had difficulty living with
 my aunt and uncle who by then had returned 
from Switzerland because they had fled to Switz
erland, I didn™t  tell you that story and so then 
she came here. And she never wanted to talk to
 me  about what happened.  It was only on her 
death that I [i ndistinct] but she lived with us.  So
 first my father died, ™
57, then my mot her died 
in ™70, and my great-aunt is still alive. And a
ll the stuff that came to 
me  that I inherited she 
took to theWi nder mere to hold for me and it wa
s all in her will that 
everything in the house 
belonged to me .  So whe n she died my friend Be rnie and I [indistinct] cleaned out the apartment 

and found some  of the pictures that
 I have here that I had never s
een.  So I pieced a lot of this 
together.  She would say little thi
ngs but not much.  It was too painful for her.  I reme mber once 
she showed me  money fr omTheresienstadt that
 they were supposedly 
into her views but she 
said it was horrible, horrible, just horrible, she 
couldn™t talk about it.  She wore black for a long 
time, wouldn™t wear lipstick. She was in mourning for a long time till her husband –. 

[i ndi st i nct ] 
 

Q: Did she tell you any stories about her husband in
 the time  that he was inTheresienstadt? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Nothing about it, no incidents? 
 

A: Nothing.  I think she felt guilty 
that she survived.  She had a great 
deal of difficulty dealing with 
any of it.  By the time  she died I wasn™t  
living at home anymore and quite honestly I was 
reluctant to ask her because it wa
sn™t  very popular yet in those days.  I™m trying to reme mber  
when Epstein™s book came  out, Childre
n of the Holocaust so when I 
read it I could identify a lot 
with that kind of feeling [indistinct] 
 

Q: So she really has little idea or share very l
ittle with you as to why 
she mi ght have survived? 
 

A:  I t  had somet h i ng t o  do wi t h  br eaki ng her  foot  and bei ng i n  t h e i n fi r mar y b u t  I  coul d never  pi ece 
together how that could help her surviv
e.  I think she felt very, very guilty. 
 

Q: Do you know how long she was inTheresienstadt, in terms of years? 

 

A: Maybe not that long. You see if
 Simon could have stayed inTher
esienstadt he mi ght have lived 
too but he got deported.  It seemed t o be that sh
e was in the right place at the right time not to 
get deported and it was pure luck. And she ne ver wanted to talk about it.  She kept it, just 

everythi ng locked in her heart.  It™s just that
 when I wouldn™t eat or some thing she™d say [in 
German refe rring to eating inTheresiens
tadt] what I™m leaving on my plate. 
 

Q: You would have drooled at thesight of that inTheresienstadt. 

 

A: Yeah, and she did show me  the money and I 
think she talked about the orchestra, maybe. 
Maybe she did talk a little, very, very little.
  She was a ve ry strong woma n.  She  was like a 
duchess, very proud, and it was her wa y to 
stay sane certainly
 after the war. 
 

Q: How old wa s she, approximately,
 when she was inTheresienstadt? 
 

A: We ll, we could figure it out.  She was 90 when she died in ™76.  So let™s say over forty years. 

 

Q: She was 90 in ™76. That means in 1945 she would have been about 59, so she was getting along 
in years. Wa s she active in anythi ng atTheresie
nstadt , social service, because there were some  

activities availabl e? 
 

A: Yeah, shows for money.  She never 
spoke about it, never spoke about it. 
 

Q: We re there any other family me mbers in 
Theresienstadt other than Ella and Simon?  
 

A: I thinkTanta Marie may have been there but I 
don™t know. They ma y have
 just gone straight to 
Auschwitz.  I could find out. 
 

Q: What about Heinz and his fa mily? 

 

A: I think my cousin Henry ma y know 
that.  I could find that out, ma ybe. 
 

Q: And he was with Lisa Lotte?   Did they
 volunteer together to work in Germany? 
 

A: Yeah. 

 
Q: Now another that that
 occurred to me , your Ho
lchherr family in the Ne
therlands, they were in 
business, right? They were in the cigar business.
 We re there any losses of property? Wa s there  
any talk about compensation? 
 

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we got back from Ger many.
 They worked hard, my mother ™s  family, and 
they would get back for the factory. 
 

Q: The one in Heidelberg
 that was confiscated?  
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: What about their busines
s activities inAmsterdam?  
 

A: They may not have been on the sa me  level. Don™
t forget they were new in the country.  It woul d 
take a while for them to –. I don™t want to brea
k your train of thought.  I 
just want to briefly 
touch on my aunt who was also living inAmst er
dam.  So you™ve got my grandparents, Simon 
andTa nta Ella and Heinz and his wi fe and fa
mily and Lisa Lotte comi ng back and then you 
have Erica and Franz.  Er ica was my mother ™s  si
ster, a year and a half 
younger.  She must have 
been born in about 1909. That™s  when she was born, March 7, 1909. 
 

Q: In the same  town? 

 

A: Yeah, and she ma rried Franz who came  from Mannheim. They left Ge rmany.  He was like an 
engineer, mechanical engineer or  ch
emical engineer, but I™m not sure. 
 
Q: An engineer.  And his last name ? 
 

A: Joseph. 

 

Q: Franz Josef, that was hi s last na me ?   
Spelled German style with an ﬁf ™, Josef. 

 

A: I don™t know because in Holland whoever I knew was a ﬁphﬂ.  So they ma y have changed it. 
And they emigrated to Holland. They didn™t emigra
te with anyone.  I think my cousin Paul was 
born in Holland. They left also in 
about ™37, got ma rried and then left 
 

Q: Around the same  ti me  as your grandparents? 

 

A: Right.  My grandparents ma y 
have gone there first and so it
 mi ght have been you know, they 
ma y have all gotten there first 
and then that mi ght have b
een why they went, you know Œ 
because that would be her parents, her step
mother and her father. And in Holland, in 
Amsterdam,  they all got stuck.  
So what happened to my mother ™s
 sister and her fa mily, they 
fled. They disguised themselves as
 French peasants, as peasants – 
 

Q: Erica and Franz. 

 

A: Yeah, and she had a little baby boy 
two or three years old–.[indistinct] 
 

Q: This is the baby born in the Netherlands? 

 
A: Yes, I think he was, my  cousin
 Paul.  Now I have pictures of my
self with Paul, just before we 
left.  I have those pictures. And they fled on bicy
cle, train, and foot. And 
they also were helped 
by underground. They had false passports. And fo
r much, much mone y, jewels and everything 
else, you could buy your way sort of to freedom. 
And it was like an underground railway.  So 
they would stop off and different people would 
escort them for a while.  But in one place 

towards the end of that journey,
 my aunt explained, nobody came. 
 

Q: You mean there was a rendezvous and they were stood up? 

 

A: Nobody came to escort them, they were strand
ed, they were stood up.  
My uncle, who was no 
slouch, he said I™m not taking any chances I™m not 
waiting any longer.  So in the mi ddle of the 
night or whatever it was he knocked on the door
 of some one he knew in Brussels who was a  
colleague of his, an engineer, an
d he said would you take
 us in. And they did. And then they 
continued on.  I reme mber my  aunt told the st
ory, they wrote out the whole story down, but 
that™s in Holland because  I saw it once. 
 

Q: When did this trip take place? 

 

A: I have to ask my aunt.  Maybe
 ™42 or ™43. We ll I could try to 
figure it out by when my cousin 
was born 
 

Q: InSwitzerland? 

 

A: In Switzerland.  So onc e I think they were in a place and there were German officers on the 
other side of the inn and they just tried to k
eep a very low profile.  My aunt like she couldn™t 
speak the language, and the baby, and she was 
wearing a babushka.  My uncle spoke French 
very well so he could almost pass. They had 
papers I think that he was maybe fromAlsace 
some where so that if there was a German accent it 
wouldn™t be so st range. And when they just 
about got to the border, even th
ere the Swiss weren™t so great an
d they sent back ma ny, ma ny 
people.  But they were lucky. They were ta
ken in, they had a chil
d.  Men and wome n were 
separated and they had to work very, very hard
 and they only got back together because my  
uncle said there was nothing he couldn™t do.  So, he
 said he could fix toilets and toilets were 
overflowing and they needed a plumber and he was good with his hands so –.Then they gave  

them a room together.  My aunt said they were so
 thrilled just to have  that room together. And 
shortly thereafter [indistinct], it may have been 
my cousin was born.  Eventually they went back 
to Holland and two more cousins were born. 
 

Q: So they survived in Switzerland 
and then returned toAmsterdam?  
 

A: Right, but en route my uncle as well as my
 cousin got tuberculosis.  In that time . 
 

Q: Your cousin meaning the – 

 

A: My fi rst cousin Paul. 

 

Q: The child born in Switzer land? 

 

A: Born in Holland. 

 
Q: InHolland? 

 

A: The first one. The second one was born in Switzerland. 

 

Q: The first child made the trip across Fr ance. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Now, did we mi ss any stories along the way?   
We  just talked about Erica, this would be your 
aunt, your grandparents we talked about them so 
far as we can reme mb er. We  got your parents 
and you across toAmerica. And then Lisa Lotte 
and Heinz we have them deported to the east. 
 

A: Maybe to Ge rmany or maybe to the east
, I don™t know. [some i
ndistinct comments]. 
 

Q: Well I™m sure that wasn™t so bad. 

 

A: It was tough, very tough, first we lived in a furnished apartment where we had be dbugs and 
everything. 
 

Q: Nothing like that in Germany.  

 

A: No, you™re right, nothing like that in Ger many. 
I™m sure my  father would say that. We weren™t 
used to that kind of
 t hi ng.  I reme mber our fi
rst night inAmerica. We  ca me at twelve o™clock 
mi dnight and we lived in the Beacon Hotel and they had two floors. 
 
Q: You were glad to get off the ship? 
 

A: Well my father said I was seasick for the whol
e trip and he was always singing to me  so I 
wouldn™t think about bei
ng seasick. The problem was that
 my father would spend hours and 
hours at night studying for the me dical boards. 
 

Q: So he could then practice. 

 

A: Right because we didn™t have money and we didn™t have an apartment. We didn™t have much of  
anything except each other.And in
 the mi ddle of the exam he had a heart attack.  That™s when 
we were still living in a furnished apar tment, [i
ndistinct] – so he was laid up with a bad heart. 
 

Q: And he was a young guy then, right? 

 

A: We ll he was older when he was ma rri
ed –[indistinct] – in his forties. 
 

Q: So he was born in 1895, 
that™s  still pretty young. 
 

A: Oh yeah he was young for that.  I always reme mb
er my father having heart trouble.  So not only 
was I always ﬁshushed™ in Germany,  I would be ﬁshushed™ inAmerica, too.  Don™t get your 

father upset. 
 

Q: But of course he didn™t have the heart trouble 
because of you? That I think we could say with a  

great deal of certitude. 
 
A: Right. And I know that, that part I knew, butI was afraid that I could make  hi m have a heart 
attack –[indistinct] because I was told that. 
 

Q: Meanwhile it was probably the stre
ss studying and trying to ma ke a living. 
 

A: Yeah because we observed, oh my  parents we
nt every Friday night to synagogue and every 
Friday night we ma de t he candles and everythi
ng and whatever they talked about, the certain 
thing about the prayer and the grace after the 
meal it had to do with 
[in Hebrew] it had to do 
with please give us sustenance a
nd my father would sort of smile 
at my mother.  It was always 
some thing that was of concern.  My mother 
made my clothes because she didn™t have any 
money for it.  She would ma ke jam a nd jelly out of
 rind. There were a lot of resourceful ways. 
My father walks so he wouldn™t 
have to take the subway.  I h
eard all those stor ies when I was 
pretty young.  So it was a time of sacrifice. 
 

Q: When did your parents and even
tually you first learn about the Holo
caust, that is to say the full 
ma gnitude of what was going on?   
They left because he couldn™t 
practice and because the Nazis 
were very mean towards the Jews and they tras
hed synagogues and so fort
h but I think it™s safe 
to say that they never could have imagined
 in 1938 and 1939 what would have happened. 
BeingAmerican during the forties and keeping 
in mi nd the controversy of whether or not – 
 

A: They only became anAmerican in ™46. They were enemy aliens when they came here. 

 

Q: Ye s, Ger man spies perhaps.  But seriously 
the argume nt thatAmericans didn™t know what wa s  
going on in Ger many – it was kind of a shock at
 the end of the war when the camps were 
opened and photographs were distri
buted. When did your parents 
first realize that there had 
been this Holocaust , concentration camps, extermination camps, millions of people. 
 

A: We ll certainly by the time they found out
 about my grandparents being deported. 
 

Q: After the war. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: So during the war – 

 

A: There wasn™t  much [indistinct].  In ™45 I 
was ten year s old.  By the time there were the 
Nuremberg t r ials I was ve ry aware of the war. 
 

Q: So you knew who Hitler was by then? 

 

A: Oh yeah, and I was following it.  I was followi
ng the Pacific and theAtlantic and I had a big 
ma p and I was looking at my ma p and at the Solom
on Islands and Iwo Jima  a
nd all of that stuff. 
I read theTimes. 
 

Q: And you learned English. 

 

A: Right. 

 
Q: The German, the French, English. 

 

A: We ll my parents felt they couldn™t keep up tw
o languages so French went by the wayside. And 
I reme mber certainly and I mean but that wa
s very late, the Nuremberg trials I knew how 
horrible things had been.  I had the papers for that with all the pictures and we didn™t have 

television or anything, you know 
Goering with all his [couldn™t understand], I had all those 
pictures, and I was reading about it and Patto
n I reme mber  andVE Day I reme mb er.  I knew 
about the war how horrible it was. 
 

Q: And you knew what the swastika stood for? 

 

 

A: And I certainly knew what the swastika stood fo
r and I knew when my pa
rents found out about 
my grandfather but I didn™t know much.  I di
dn™t know when my parents found out, I think 
gradually they began to find out what it was all a
bout. The first time I ever saw pictur es of 
everything was very late. 
 

Q: When your aunt died 
or just before you – 
 

A: No, not those pictures, of the concentration cam
ps and the bodies and that was -- well of course  
there weren™t any movies around. 
 

Q: No, not movies, documentary .. 

 

A: Yeah, this was a docume ntary --when I was in San Francisco in 1958 that was the first time  I 
had actually seen all those bodies
.Ireme mber once hearing about lampshades and soap and I 
couldn™t believe that that could ha
ppen.  I just didn™t believe that 
that was possible.  From hair, 
ma ttresses.  I didn™t believe that that could be 
done.  I couldn™t believe 
that. –[indistinct].  I 
could only deal with situations 
like whenTanta Ella came -- I  
know when we gotTa nta Ella at 
the airport, it was nineteen fort
y some thing, six, well certainly 
by then but that was after the 
war.  I don™t know what they knew. You know wh
atever the Red Cross let through. We  didn™t 
hear from my aunt and uncle, anyway they we
re stuck in Switzerland. We  didn™t hear much – 

[indistinct].  If we did, my fath
er was the kind of person who woul
d not shar e that with me .  He 
would protect me.  He would shelter me. 
 

Q: Wa nted to preserve a little bit of sunshine. 

 

A: Yeah, he did. [indistinct] 

 

Q: In retrospect, basically you got a little informa
tion here, a little bit here and there.  Of all your  
fa mily me mbers who would credit as being your single biggest source as to what happened to 

your family in Germany and then outside of Ge
rmany?  You have your 
parents, you haveTa nta 
Ella, you got Erica. 
 

A: My aunts, Erica, when I went to Holland a few years ago.  First of all when she first came here 
in ™52 she brought the diary and 
that was very interesting. 
 

Q: This was the diary – 

 
A: Switzerland. 

 

Q: They had a diary. 

 

A: That my unc le kept. You know
, a journal.  She still has it. 
 

Q: This is their underground railway escape. 

 

A: So I knew their story very well.  I knew what
 I told you of our story 
from my father, but our 
story was not through the Holocaust.  It wa
s getting away before the Holocaust. 
 

Q: Getting away before the Holocaust and before
 you knew what the Holocaust was going to be. 
 

A: Right, so Erica told me not too long ago that
 when my grandparents were killed and that was a 
big shock. 
 

Q: Even they skirted, Erica skirted the Holocaust.  
Ella, I suppose, of all of your surviving fa mily 
is the one that was the most involved in the Holocaust. 
 

A: Right.  I got little from her. 

 

Q: Because she didn™t want to speak. And the othe
r me mbers of the family who were very directly 
involved in the Holocaust, none of them survived. 
 

A: Right.  OnlyTa nta Marie who lived in th
e Bronx and I never had any conversation about 
[i ndistinct]. All the cousins, they were like te
n years older than I, and they ma de it out. This 
was all in my mother ™s side.  See on my fa ther
™s  side a lot of his 
grandfather ™s brethren, 
siblings, died early, or didn™t have boys.  I didn™t 
have kids or they did.  I think all their kids 
ma de it but I don™t know what happened to them.  I really don™t know much about my father ™s  

side of the family.  I me an I know about various 
cousins and their children but not too ma ny.  O f  
my grandfather, he was the ol
dest too.  He sent everybody thr
ough school. They we re all in 
practice. They were lawyers.  My father ™s fa
mily was pretty successful, they were lawyers and 
doctors. 
 

Q: We ll your mother ™s  side of the fa
mily also were rather successful. 
 

A: I think they were, they really were but my 
father was such a snob you would have thought that 
my mother came from – 
 

Q: The wrong side of the tracks. 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Instead where did they come  from, 
Wa ldorf and Heidelberg, not bad places? 
 

A: Right. They were very 

 

Q: In fact, if you woul
d look at the Ge rmany today, people 
from Heidelberg andWa ldorf would 

look down on the people from Essen. 
 
A: We ll I think it ha d to do really wi
th my father ™s attitude that  his 
family was the best  in the world 
and nobody could comp ete. A very interesting thi
ng that I just found out last week because one 

of my  mother ™s cousins was here fr
om Italy.  She has her story from Italy. They went to Italy. 
Everybody went some where else.  So me one else went
 to SouthAfrica, some  to Canada, some  to 
England, you know but they™re different people. A
nd she said that my mother ™s family was the 
most, you know they always felt they were the mo
st elegant, and they thought that they looked 
down on the rest of the fa mily.  So both my 
parents came from sort of snobbish backgrounds 
but my mother kind of gave up to go along with my father. 
 

Q: We ll even you look pretty elegant with your foot
 laid up like that on t
op of a chair after an 
operation what we™re talking eight hours, le
ss than that, five hours after surgery. 
 

A: We ll I guess we™re all survivors. 

 

Q: Ye s, one thing or another.  But as for the rest
 of the story of your mother ™s  family we can get 
some  more infor mation from your aunt – 
 

A: From Holland. And Henry Bauer in Rego Park, Qu
eens, and Claire, my cousin Claire, if I need 
anything they could all –[indistin
ct] and they™re my best sources. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: I™m good at doing this – and 
detective work [indistinct]. 
 
Q: We ™ll look forward to that and 
to you getting on 
your feet again. 
 
A: Do you want to see any pictures? 

 

Q: Yeah, but we ™ll just close the 
tape and look at some  
photos.  On behalf of the U.S. Holocaust 
Museum I™d like to thank you for your time and your help. 
 

A: Is there anything else that I should have told you? 

 

A: You look kind of exhausted by now. 

 

A: I™m not exhausted, I can talk forever.  I thi
nk what™s important is th
at yes a lot of people  
perished and it™s  horrendous.  But the mi racl
e is all who survived
 and overcame all the 
adversities – mother, father, aunts, uncles,Ta nta 
Ella, they all su
rvived to live very productive 
often giving service to others ki
nd of lives.   Either  they were 
successful, professionally, they 
had children, or they did things 
for others, they lived worthwhile. 
 

Q: Anunderstateme nt. 

 

A: Right.  I me an they lived the kinds of lives any
one could be proud of in spite of what they went  
through.  Because they could have said screw it 
I don™t want to do anything ever again.  I give 
up -- or what ever.  But those who survived and di d 
it well are the answer to Hitler, that in spite 
of all the adversities they were able to overc
ome and ma intain a connection to their Judaism 

because my great aunt  de spiteTheresienstadt
 everythi ng she was very orthodox when she came  
toAmerica.  She held on to her religion; she 
held on to her dignity; sh
e held on to her keeping 
the family together; she held
 on to knowledge and explori
ng other area in life, you know 
reading.  Certainly my parents are excellent ex
amples.  My father was a wonderful doctor and 
he also took care of people free of
 charge.  So he was also a huma nitarian.  My mother was very 
supportive and Franz and Erica founded an old age 
home.  I don™t know if they founded it; they 
were very instrume ntal in putting up an old agehome  and they did all the design for the old age 
home. 
 

Q: InAmsterdam?  

 

A: Yeah, inAmsterda m. And then the rest of 
the fa mily too in spite of what happened. They 
overcame. 
 

Q: To that list I would just lik
e to add you. You certai
nly were successful as
 a professi
onal, still 
are, serving ma nkind, huma nkind.  I don™t know which campus is it you™re – 
 

A: Now I™ve been in the school system for 32 years. 

 

Q: NewYorkC ity? 

 

A: NewYork City public schools as a teacher firs
t and as a guidance counselor.  I was awarded 
guidance counselor of the year twice. A
nd now I™m on s a bbatical and I™m looking at how 
children go about ma king plans.  I™m going to write
 a book and I™m also a therapist in private 
practice.  I think what I™m happiest about is that
 in 32 years of being in the school system I was 
very commi tted to my job and never once did I [i
ndistinct]. And now I feel that I™m ready to 
retire next year, I™m not burned out
 but I feel I™m ready to move on. 
 

Q: A new career? 

 

A: Right, bigger horizons and a few books. Tha
nk you for giving me  the opportunity for doing a 
little postscri pt. 
 

Q: On that happy note I again want to thank you.
