A: No, I di dn™t have a mi ddle name. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: She has two names. You know, the reason t hat she has 
Aviva
, because it was 
after m y father come from visit from 
Palestine
. It was not yet 
Israel
 the
n, you 

know, it was 
Palestine
. British Œ British 
Palestine
. 
Q: And what does 
Aviva

Œ 
pardon me?

A: Oh, fre Œ
 Aviva

she wa 
Œ also, there was city

Tel

themselves in Russian, and someti mes in Polish, but with us the y all spoke Polish.

Interview with George Dynin

Q: Tell me. 
A: Because Yiddish Œ people that spoke Yiddish, the y couldn™t survive. You don™t 

know why. You see, peop Œ nobody will tell you this Œ 

Q: Tell me. 

A: Œ but I can tell you. The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very 
heavy kind of m- music type of thing, you know. And people that spoke Yiddish, 
they can™t get rid of it. So, you know, as soon as the y opened mouth, you know, 

they Œ i-i-in Polish, they knew that the y are Jewish peopl e, and it  means that the y 

couldn™t Œ they couldn™t save themselves pretending to be Poles. So many 

thousands of people died because t he y spoke Yiddish. It ™s very unusual, but that™s is 

true, I bi Œ nobody tell you because the y sa y that it is offensive. It™s not offensive, 

it™s just actually, this is how it is. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did Œ 
A: Yeah, go ahead. 
Q: Does that mean that  most people who spoke Yiddish didn™t speak Polish, or the y 

spoke it wi th an accent ? 

A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. Some, maybe in the small sh Œ s-
s 
Œ 

shtetls, you 
Œ 
like you know, 
the children, maybe the y just spoke Yiddish only, but 

 
Interview with George Dynin

most peopl e spoke bot h Polish and Yiddish. The ones that just spoke Yiddish
, you 
know. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. So, were your parents more assimilated, in Œ in that they spoke 

Polish and Russi an, or Œ 

A: Absolutely not . 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y been Œ we 
[indecipherable]
. It™s better Œ m y father, he preferred to have a 

kosher food. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But you know, from this you cannot Œ you change the type of food, and nobody 

knows who you are, you know. But the language you cou Œ you couldn™t get rid of 
it. 
Q: No. 
A: It™s just  Œ it™s Œ 
yeah.
 
Q: It™s an accent, or it™s a Œ 

A: It™s accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. So that™s Œ 
many 
people died because of this, but see, I am t he first one that™s not afraid to tell about. 

Q: Oka y. Tell me a littl e bit about your father and your mother Œ

hi m walki ng someplace Œ 

Q: Who?
 
A: The Jews Œ 

Q: Oka y.

through m y window,they 
Œ they have been stayi ng next t o the water well. And it

afraid to run away because there will be not Œ nothing to eat, you know. But you

how many
 because t he police, when Œ the Bel orussian police have been the ones 
that killed t hem, and they been complaining that 18 didn™t  show off, you know, t hat 
somebody must tell them Œ tell them, you know. So the y did run away, you know, 

18 of them. And the Poles, you know, there was somethi ng else I sa y to Poles Œ  you

they lie that they going to

way the y decided that this cart, the y liked t o have 
[indecipherable]
 cart, so the y Œ 
they gave us another cart, you know. That™s fine, so we got another cart. So we have 

anyt hing left, because this means t hat the y used to us, you know, that we Œ 
we are 

oka y, you know what I mean? We Œ they figure out the y can question what we™re 
doing here, you know. 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ but several Œ such a mess of  disorganizati on that they didn™t Œ di dn™t have a 

time to Œ t o check Œ  

Q: To think, yeah. 

A: To see Œ  yeah, oka y. Well, we didn™t realize that in this cart, under straw, there 

are guns, ammunition, uniforms and everyt hing, you know? But we didn™t Œ I didn™t 
check what™ s underneat h, I figure I just Œ 
you know.
 And so we went in one place, 
you know. Here again, we have to do with priest, how about this? We went to one 
place that we decided we should run away from t hem because the y are going to 

Königsberg
, and not 
Warsaw
, we better get  out from here Œ this place. 
Q: Oka y. 

A: So I went to this church, and the guy, t his priest was ver Œ was very ir Œ 

understandi ng, and he said yes, by all means, don™t sta y with them. So, I mean, but

where we going? So he got Œ he Œ he told me exactly where to go and where I

[indecipherable]

A: I Œ I wil l give hi m letter that you sa y shoul d accomm
odate you, youknow.
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: So this is something we should do. That was easy to say, but difficult to do it, 

because the y watching us. The y st arted to wat ch us somehow, and they put 

horsemen on both sides of our car. 

Q: Well, you have t he guns. 
A: Ye-Yeah, but Œ 
but we 
Œ I didn™t know I have the guns, you see Œ 
Q: Oka y. 
A: Œ I didn™t know. But then, you know, so after someti mes, you know, the guy on 

the left side start to be tired or something, and he disappeared from this, I don™t 

know what  happened. And the other guy, just before we Œ we cut Œ 
we come to t he 

ci Œ to the town that we should go, he stil l was there, but he has close eyes, and he 

was sleeping with the horse, you know. But Œ but Œ but you know Œ but we went a 

 
Interview with George Dynin  
 
October 21, 2015 
 
 
 
208
 
little farther, and I figure out he sleep very well, and le Œ we can come back, you 
know, we can turn back and turn this place that he 
[indecipherable]
. And then was 
Œ then th Œ the problem was, it was German camp next to this, and I figure out the y 

will see that somebody™s running from this thi ng, the y can run after us, you know. 

But this horse, just like we understand something, he start  to run like crazy, you 
know, and I didn™t sa y anyt hing. And we j ust went up so fast, you know, that they f 
Œ I figure out even if they will see that we™re something, will Œ i t will be too late for 

them to catch up wi th us, you know. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: So the y Œ event ually we found the 
soltys
, the guy who was in charge, and he 

accommodate us. So this was one part.  

Q: So now you have a horse and a cart and weapons and guns and everyt hing. 
A: Yeah, yeah, b
ut the hor 
Œ the horse we gave better to t hese guys that 
accommodate us, because we didn™t Œ what are we going to do with t his horse, you 
know. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But how do I know about the guns? Because Œ 
because we
 left this cart, you 

know, after the Œ 
they 
Œ the y took this horse, they too Œ t he y left the cart, and we 
went to these woods, you know. They were bi g woods, you know. So we figure out 

 
Interview with George Dynin

this is safer to be in the woods wi th other people. And he told us that Ukrainian 
partisans had been there, and the y found guns, ammuniti on. But the y left uniforms. 

So we took the uniform. Later, we sold them. What kind of guns, they took guns 

and ammunition, but uniforms the y sold it, you know? So the Œ oka y, there was a Œ 

y
ou 
like to farther? Everyt hing is t here. 
Q: Well, what I want to know is Œ is did you Œ did the cer Œ  
[break 
- technical 
interruption] 
Oka y, so when we stopped before, we were Œ before this break, we 

were talking about how you and your mot her t urned off to a little side street with a

the problem was not what the y shoot, but  they shoot against them, because we have 
been there. So this Œ after some ti mes, we didn™t wait too long, they started to shoot 

in the Œ in our direction to hit this Œ 

Q: Germans. 

A: Œ Germans, you know. So can you figure what it was, i t was big, heavy artillery, 

was not just small artil Œ and we Œ so there was one place I don™t rem ember, we dig 
ourselves, so it was already dark, and we have been in some kind of hou Œ place in

us, it will be terribl e, but it didn™t , but was hitting all around us, you know. But one 

of them hit  very close to us, I remember very much, and we had been shocked, you 

know. But  this was Œ after Œ after this, we had enough of this area. We had come t o
