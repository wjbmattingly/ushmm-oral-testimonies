BEATRICE LAZAR 
November 16, 1990 
 
My name before my marriage was Beatrice Le
ibovich, becomi ng after marriage Lazar.  I am 
from Roma nia, the town of Galati, born on 30th of
 October, 1927.  My father was an accountant.  
My mother was home , housewife.  I had a brother 
older than me  with seven years.  When I was 
six years old my brother told me that Hitler came 
in power and we'll suffe r because we are Je ws.  
In 1940 my parents...my father worked.  My 
mot her was a housewife and I started the 
elementary school when I was a kid.  I didn't suffe r 
but later in the high school, I started to feel 
that I'm Jewish because we were expelled from
 school.  We  were not allowed to learn in 
Romanian schools, and I had to st ay one year 
at home  until a Jewish 
high school was created 
where all the Jewish kids from Galati went to
 study.  And also in 1940, when the Russians 
occupied Bessarabia (ph), a strong tendency exis
ted between the ____ to leave for Soviet Union 
because it was said that anti-Semitism was not so 
strong there and they could be able to find to 
work, which wasn't  true.  When my fath...brothe
r was in school, he wa
s beaten up twice and 
because he suffered so much he decide d to leave a
nd he lived in Bessarabia.  My father...it wasn't  
easy for him but he agreed with this because he 
thought that he'll save him this way.  Being the 
younger, I rema ined with my parents.   After that
 because my father was over fifty years old, he  
wasn't  taken to forced...he was exempt from forced
 labor but he was forced to clean up the snow 
for five days and then he was taken with all th
e Jewish me n from the town as hostage.  He was 
interned in a school where he was living on the fl oor then.  We  were allowed to bring him a bed 
and food.  They didn't receive there 
not ever a glass with water.  As hostages they were forced to 
work but their food was in charge of the fa mily, of
 their families.  I remember that one day these 
people came in the Jewish houses and they confiscated
 our radios and they and they said that we 
are spreading rumors and that we are not allowed 
to own any more radios.  My father rema ined 
there interned and after two months he was set fr
ee and allowed to go home , but he wasn't  able to 
find to work and it was very difficult to live.  
He tried to work.  I fi
nished school and in 1944

after the armistice came, we started to receive news
 from my brother.  It wa s like an iron curtain.  
We didn't know what happened to him, but after 
a bit we started to have news and we learned 
about him.  He got ma rried.  He had two kids, 
and in 1946 he wrote that if he could get some  
papers he would be able to come  back to 
Romania because many Jews who came from Romania 
succeeded to come  back.  My father worked hard to
 to get these papers and he had to go twice to 
Bucharest.  During his second trip, he fall from 
t he tramway and he died, and this way we were 
not able to get the papers for my brother and 
he rema ined in Soviet Union until 1973 when he 
left for Israel with his family and after a few ye
ars he died.  I finished 
the school at the Jewish 
high school.  After 1944, we were allowed to go b
ack to the Roma nian school, schools, but not 
too many went because we felt that we were e
xpelled and we didn't want to go back, so we 
rema ined in this Jewish school.  In 1944 we 
lived in Galati through hard da ys because the 
Russians came  as allies, as friends, and the Germans who were very...in big number, retreated.  

They had to flew and they they burned the tow
n.  We stayed almost one week hidden because 
they were burning everywhere.  The whole town wa
s in flames.  We escaped and we were able to 

return to our home s.  I finished the school after 
that in 194...I went I went 
back to school after I 
stayed one year at home.  But I went to to Je
wish school.  And I conti
nued this Jewish school 
until 1947.  It was under the Communists.  And in 
1947 when I finished, I came to Bucharest.   
 

PAUSE 

 

 Life for me  was very difficult, very hard becau
se  of the sufferences of
 my parents.  I was 
still a kid.  I wasn't  able to do some thing on my 
own and my father and my father being interned 
in these camps working and being over fifty ye
ars old, it was difficult for him to sustain for 
himself and we had a difficult family life.  I went
 to school and that was 
it.  But I felt all these 
consequences of the Nazis because my father su
ffered being a Jew so th
is reflected on my my 
life, on our life, and we didn't...we weren't able to
 do too mu ch.  After that he died, so I...after 
that I I went to Bucharest, but 
I wanted to...and in Bucharest I want
ed to continue my studies but

I wasn't  able so I renounced a
nd I took a job and I worked.  I 
ma rried.  My daughter was born.  
She studied at her turn and that my my job it 
wasn't  easy because I had relatives outside the 
country.  Immediately after afte
r one of my relatives was livi
ng with...we were asked to come  
and to give a report if we are 
ma intaining relations with them. 
 Then my  daughter left and we 
retired.  We  decided to leave.  We  renounced our
 pensions, to our apartme nt, so one of the 
reasons for which we were allowed to leave quick
ly was because we left an apartment and two 
pensions and this way on which we were able to 
leave.  We  stayed in Canada with our daughter.  
We have a...we have a...have from the governme nt
, we have a me dicine and health aid and we 
can we can have a decent life.
