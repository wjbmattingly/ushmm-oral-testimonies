THEODORE FEDER AND HERBERT KATZKI 
June 2, 1995 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Would you te
ll me your name and --  
MR. KATZKI:  Yes, my name  is Herbert Katzki.  I 
used to be with the JD
C.  I retired.  At the 
time I retired I was associate executive vice-pre
sident of the agency.  During the time of the 
holocaust when I was stationed over in Europe 
I was secretary of the 
European council of the 
JDC.  The European council was ma de up or theoretically made up of the leadership of the 
various committees and the various countries in 
which we operated but that never came to be 
because of the war with germany which came 
on too soon after one had the inspiration of 
establishing the European council.  So I had the ti
tle but there wasn't  any council, really, to be 
with.  The experience that I had 
with the -- with the holocaust was not a very long one.  I'd been 
in Paris.  I'd come  over to Paris.  I got there 
in November 1939.  They had been there in -- in 

Paris until -- until we were chased out by the Germans.  We had our headquarter s, our offi ce, in 

-- in Paris and there was a series of transmutations
.  We  had to evacuate the -- Paris when they -- 
when the Germans came in.  We closed the 
office down on Tuesday.  The Germans came into 
Paris on Thursday.  And I went then to 
Marca (ph.) and worked in the unoccupied 
____________ of France for the Jewish refugees w
ho had come  down into the unoccupied 
____________.  

INTERVIEWER:  Let me  just stop you a second because
 I want to hear about
 all of that in your 
single interview, but let's just talk about
 the period right after the war --   
MR. KATZKI:  Okay.  

INTERVIEWER:  -- when you and Ted were
 involved in the same  operation.  
MR. KATZKI:  I see.  Well, right -- right -- right 
after -- right after the war 
I'd been up in -- in -- 
back -- back in -- in Paris and we were ma king 
a change in the me mber was in charge of our 
operations in Germany.  That was a ma n by the name  of Jacob Grobe.  He was coming out.  

Some body had to go in to hold down the fort.  So 
I was sent in from Paris to take over the

German ope ration.  The headquarters of the JDC at 
that time  were in Hurst (ph.).  Hurst is a 
suburb of Frankfurt and a couple 
weeks after I got there Unrah (
ph.), which had his headquarters 
in -- in Hurst had to move their office up to 
Arelson (ph.) which is not far from the border 
between the American, the British occupied, so a
nd so, of -- of a -- Germany.  And so I ended up 
in Arelson.  I guess I got up there 
in January 1946.  And that sort 
of thing.  And it was while I 
was up in Arelson that I me t Mr. Feder who was at
 that  time associat ed with Unrah in their 
headquarters operation which also was up in Arel
son.  And so that's  our first.  Our first 
association would be locate in th
e same  me tropolis of Arelson wh
ich I think had a population of 
2500 people.  The --   

INTERVIEWER:  Oka y.  Let's -- let me  just have 
Ted introduce himself as well and then we can 
find out mor e .  

MR. FEDER:  My name is Ted Fede r.  Presentl
y retired.  Still working in a number of programs 
in the headquarters of the JDC and this pertains 
to both of us that if they can't find it in the 
archives ask Katzki or Feder and they'll tell 
you.  And it's true because I think our combined 
knowledge is extraordinary.  When
 we moved to Alician (ph.) th
ere was some  thing unreal about 
being in a small town and being involved in 
an organization supposedly  helping so ma ny peopl e 
and -- and communication was terrible
.  There was not a main line. 
 The roads were very difficult 
and no one was happy being in Alician and it could 
very well have been that when Unrah phased 
out, which was '47, wer e  the ____________ commi
ssion of the international refugee 
organization or PCIRO took over from Unrah, the st
aff and then a year later IRO took over.  
Then eventually it was taken over by 
the UN commissioner.  ____________ commissi oner 
refugees.  You could imagine being 
in a small town like that  there wasn't  a great and --  deal to 
do.  ____________ a movie.  The Unrah really could 
have cared less about those people and 
giving them any kind of cultural services.  So 
there's a real difficult place to be in.  I had 
me ntioned that my ____________ with the JDC becau
se I was dissatisfied 
with -- being with 
Unrah for many reasons.  Political for one and the 
fact that there -- there were so ma ny people 
who looked to ma ke ____________ working with Unra
h and hundreds of employees were sent -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
3 
 
sent back for getting into things they shouldn't ha
ve gotten in.  And it was 
then that either Herb 
or Harry Beal (ph.) who is an a
ssociate, listened to my plea to 
take me  on staff with the JDC and 
____________ ____________ to September '46.   
INTERVIEWER:  Now did you -- you both were inthe headquarters office or you had, I assume , 

very different re
sponsibilities.  
MR. FEDER:  Different
 responsibilities.  
MR. KATZKI:  Different responsib
ilities.  We ll, up -- up in Alicia
n I was with one agency and 
Ted was with another agency.  My agency was 
a joint di stribution commi ttee and Ted's agency 
was Unrah up in Arelson, so that each of us for our own agency had our own jobs to do and 

contacts which we mi ght have had were incidental
 to -- incidental to our
 work or a cooperative 
effort or some thing like -- like that.  But our agen
cies were so independent of each other.  The -- 
how did the JDC get up to Arelson?   Ted -- Te
d mi ght have explained the circumstances under 
which JDC got into -- to -- to Germany.  There 
was a very difficult time  for JDC to get into 
Germany.  Ar my -- army had responsibility as an 
occupier.  They farmed out the welfare work to 

Unrah because they said "We're soldiers.  We 'r e 
not social workers," and they turned it over.  
Ted explained all of that earlier 
on and -- and -- and then with the 
-- with that kind of a situation 
JDC had to come  and then ____________ Unrah's offices and that's why when they moved up to 

Arelson, the JDC had to move up to Arelson too.  The -- 

MR. FEDER:  Herb, would you sa
y that the problem we had in getting called forward to 
Germany was different than the other ____________ agencies --  

MR. KATZKI:  No --   

MR. FEDER:  -- ____________ the same  trouble?   Didn't the --   

MR. KATZKI:  We  -- we -- we all had the same  
trouble because the army  was not enamored of 
having civilians over -- over r
unning the territory over which they
 had responsibility.  So they 
weren't anxious to let the -- let the civilians come
 in.  So they -- they -- the Unrah, of course, 
they -- they had sent the official
 status because they were invited in by the army to do the welfare 
work, but that didn't me an they ha
d to let the voluntary agencies in
 at the same  ti me .  And so the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
4 
 
voluntary agency had a very difficult time to get 
permissions to have their people come  into 
the -- come into the country.  I think the fi rst fell
ow who went  was, I think, Eli Rock (ph.).  Eli 
Rock went in with the -- with the first 
____________ or it must have been around in July or 
August of 19 -- 1945 that he went in with a small t
eam into -- into Munich.  But then after that 
had been done and then the drill was worked out 
we were able to get our people then all right, 
but they had to be called forward.  Each pers
on individually had to be called forward into 
Germany with their set of tr
avel ____________ from the army  and everything else in order of 
them to be able to get into the country.  It wa
sn't  -- it wasn't  -- it wasn't  easy.  And the other 
agencies had the same diffi culties.   
INTERVIEWER:  What othe
r obstacles were there in terms of
 your getting entrenched there?   
MR. KATZKI:  They -- they -- they
 -- the di ffi culty with this as 
I -- as I explained, the army 
didn't want civilians running around.  Once you got 
into the place and that was part of this  
business being called forward and so
 on after that  it was all ri ght, but the job was to get in ther e 
and then -- in -- in the first place.  

MR. FEDER:  ____________ fortunate that before us
, before we came in there was a caddy of 
people including rabb
is, chaplains --   
MR. KATZKI:  That was -- that was military.  

MR. FEDER:  Please, please.  I'm s a ying th
ey did our job.  Kwasnick (ph.), not Kwasnick, 
Trousner (ph.) --  

MR. KATZKI:  Yeah.  

MR. FEDER:  -- was responsible for having an or
ganization that st arted a central committee.  
MR. KATZKI:  That's  right.   

MR. FEDER:  He was there.  Ma
ny others were there seeing what
 the needs were.  They were 
very unhappy that they could onl
y do a limited amount of help. 
 In organization they had no 
supplies and so -- but they did.  We  -- we came in to a well organized committee.    

MR. KATZKI:  Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
5 
 
MR. FEDER:  Of course what was sad was once th
ey got organized they fo
rgot those they didn't 
have to to organize.  But that's politics 
in any kind of organization.  But --   
MR. KATZKI:  With -- with -- with
 the rabbis they -- th
ey could easily get in because they went 
in with the ar my, so they came in that way.  But I think that the work that they did for --  for the 
Jewish people in the country were -- were 
-- came under the heading 
of extra curricular 
activities.  

MR. FEDER:  We ll, obviously.  
They ____________.  ____________ was kicked out.  
MR. KATZKI:  That's  right.  

MR. FEDER:  Max ____________ was given the reprimand.  

MR. KATZKI:  That's  right.    

MR. FEDER:  So if they --    

MR. KATZKI:  ____________ extra curricular.  

MR. FEDER:  So -- but they -- th
ey -- they di d a great deal.  
MR. KATZKI:  They -- they -- they -- they di
d a good job.  For example, the JDC had a great 
deal of difficulty in getting its supplies into Germ
any.  A couple of reasons.  
First -- first of all, 
our -- our supplies were piling up in the -- in the 
ports in the United States because we  couldn't 
get any ships.  The ships were all taken up by 
the -- by the army for movi ng their troops around 
and so on.  And it was well -- well into 1945 or '46 even, when we were able to move -- move 

any supply -- move any supplies at all.  In 
the meantime though, what the -- what the chaplains 
did through the APO they would write letters ho
me to their families and say "Will you please 
start sending parcels." And so they sent them all 
kinds of parcels into -- 
to the vari ous chaplains 
and that was a -- a ____________ supply program, but --  

MR. FEDER:  We ll, but it was really --  

MR. KATZKI:  -- it wasn't  really much of
 a supply program because you can't  --   
MR. FEDER:  Not very much.  

MR. KATZKI:  -- you can't --  

MR. FEDER:  First of all, APO 
was limited the si ze of package --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
6 
 
MR. KATZKI:  That's  right. 
 And how ma ny chaplains -- 
MR. FEDER:  How mu ch did you 
put in a square foot?    
MR. KATZKI:  That's  right.  ____________ chaplains -- 
MR. FEDER:  And -- and the -- ma
ny of the -- of the chaplains ha
d trouble once they got it.  
How to distribute it?   Who should get it?  Do you 
give it to leadership?  Do you give it to a 
home ?     

MR. KATZKI:  That's  right.  

MR. FEDER:  And so they had real problems.  

MR. KATZKI:  That's  right.  So -- so that wa
s the beginning of the -- 
of the -- of the supply 
problem.  So the JDC was rather handicapped in
 the beginning.  We  could get some  staff in 

despite the problems which I me ntioned before.  We
 could some  staff in but we couldn't  get any 
supplies in and consequently when we went arou
nd to talk to the refugees the refugees said 
"Where is the joint in 
all of this?   We  see their people. 
 We  wa nt supplies and we don't -- we 
don't get it.  Where is the joint and what is the jo
int doing? "   Well, that 
wore out of -- after -- 
when supplies started comi ng in they
 had other complaints ____________ ____________.  But 
after --  after that, but those were the princi
ple handicaps which the JDC had in getting their 
operation going in Germany.  First, getting their 
staff in and secondly, getting the supplies in.  
But after awhile that -- that -- that  -- 
that worked -- worked out all right.  
MR. FEDER:  Was it interesting that  ther e was 
a different approach by Unrah and the army for 
the displaced persons in 
Austria.  Reme mber?  
MR. KATZKI:  Yeah.  

MR. FEDER:  We  were given the re
sponsibility of running the camps.  
MR. KATZKI:  We ll --   

MR. FEDER:  Yes.  Yes.  They were 
our camps.  There wasn't  a large --  
MR. KATZKI:  Oh, wait a mi nute.  They were our camps because they were opened up to the 

benefit of the -- of the 
-- um -- the Hungarians who came ove r the boarder.  
MR. FEDER:  No.  No, that was -- that was later, Herb.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
7 
 
MR. KATZKI:  Oh.  
MR. FEDER:  This -- this was a method of 
operating.  ____________ was the director of half a 
dozen camps.  

MR. KATZKI:  Wa s he ?   
I didn't know that.  
MR. FEDER:  Yes, and we had the responsib
ility.  Unrah supplied the food and so on --  
MR. KATZKI:  Yes.    

MR. FEDER:  -- but we -- we were
 the key here all of this.  
MR. KATZKI:  I see.  Yeah --  

MR. FEDER:  Of course, when I think of some  of
 the beautiful places they were put up in former  
PB sanitarium on the top of mountains and -- no w
onder they didn't want to move when they had 
to be moved.  

MR. KATZKI:  They lived a life of Reilly. 

MR. FEDER:  But the -- the army, who -- who wa
s Clark (ph.), General Cl
ark was an officer.  
MR. KATZKI:  Clark.  Clar
k was in Viennan, yes.  
MR. FEDER:  He -- he was much
 more tolerant than what we had in Germany.  Maybe it's 
because some  of our JDC people were good poker players --   

MR. KATZKI:  Joe --    

MR. FEDER:  and played poker --   

MR. KATZKI:  Joe --   

MR. FEDER:  -- played poker with them.  

MR. KATZKI:  Joe Silva (ph.).  

MR. FEDER:  You never know how you got a h
ead in dealing with -- with people.  
MR. KATZKI:  Yeah.    

MR. FEDER:  But your responsibilities in -- in
 Germany, Herb, we didn't  use a heavy hands on 
the people in the camps or rather --   

MR. KATZKI:  No.  

MR. FEDER:  -- our people in the camps --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
8 
 
MR. KATZKI:  No.  
MR. FEDER:  -- or in Munich
 because ____________ they would do what they could.  It wasn't 
easy.  

MR. KATZKI:  They were doing their work.  No. 
 No.  No, my responsibility in Germany was 
an overall responsibility and -- be
ing the overall director.  In my
 -- I spent my ti me traveling 
around one to -- one mo me nt I went down to Munich
 and the next mo me nt to Frankfurt and the 
next mo me nt up to Bergen-Belsen a
nd the next time  up to Berlin in
 order to keep in touch with 
our offices to see what they'r e doing and if there's any way in which I can be helpful to -- to be 

helpful and try to keep things going as well as -- 
as -- as well as I could.  But -- bu the JDC -- at 
this prince -- princi ple, the princi ple of the JD
C was "to trust the ma n in the field."  We  ran a 
desimplized operation under those circumstances.  
If the me n in the filed did a good job he got 
the ____________ for it.  If the job wasn't  being done
 very well not necessarily by him but even 
by his staff me mber he's  the ma n who -- who --who -- who -- who -- who -- who took the lumps 

because as I said we -- we  -- we trusted the me n 
in the field, but he had to bury his responsibility 
then and --   

INTERVIEWER:  So di d you -- did you feel you ha
d a lot of leverage to do your job?  
MR. FEDER:  We ll, there's no question that we were
 given full latitude to carry on the programs.  
There mi ght have been questions that were raised
 about policy which than 
we would relate if we 
could get through on the phone to have some
body ____________ in the wilderness, but we had 
to ma ke the decisions ourselves and I think to so
rt of prove of that a number of people we sent 
home were, I don't we sent one guy home --  

MR. KATZKI:  In fact, I can thi
nk of one -- one wome n we s e nt hom
e.  She was a social worker 
who had been so -- so attuned to the American wa
ys of doing things that if she could not find an 
agency to which she mi ght refer a di fficult case she went to pi eces, but we couldn't use people 

who went to pieces because there weren't ma ny agen
cies to which they could refer people.  They 
had to do the work themselves.  

MR. FEDER:  No.  No.  No --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
9 
 
MR. KATZKI:  So -- so she was sent home.  
MR. FEDER:  The question --   

MR. KATZKI:  One.  

MR. FEDER:  -- when -- when you think of 
all the black ma rketing that was going on --  
MR. KATZKI:  We ll --   

MR. FEDER:  -- how easy one could fall 
into it.  Our people were --     
MR. KATZKI:  We  didn't  have that.  

MR. FEDER:  -- were -- were
 just great.  They --   
MR. KATZKI:  We  didn't  have that.  

MR. FEDER:  -- no one ma de -- no one
 that I know of ma
de -- made money to be there to make 
money.  

INTERVIEWER:  Did it take a special kind of person to do the ki
nd of work both of you did?   
MR. KATZKI:  I think so.  I -- 
I -- I -- I think the kind of pers
on who went -- went into work 
overseas with us was the kind of a person who wa
s not so muc h interested in hims elf and his 
own advancement and that sort of thing, but feltan inner urge to do some thing for some body else 

and got his satisfactions out of
 doing some thing for some body else rather than just concern 
himself about -- about -- about -- about himself.  And --    

MR. FEDER:  I think JDC was just "dog on luc
ky" because the interview, for exa mple,  you 
gave me .  I recall one question you asked me .  
You said do I have anything against German 
Jews.  

MR. KATZKI:  Sure.  

MR. FEDER:  I got that ____________, no, but other 
than that you knew me .  You knew my 
reputation, the work I was doing and I know that 
what we were looking for wasn't  only capacity 
to mi nister programs, but also the tact necessa
ry to deal with the army, with Unrah, with 
committees and in those days there weren't ma
ny people who were commonly organizers.  As a 
ma ter of fact , school social work hadn't  begun 
in this aspect of the importance of commonly 
organization and I -- I think we were
 just fortunate.  We  didn't fall.    The committees as much as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
10 
 
they would give us a hard time knew how far to go 
and when to stop because they -- they saw in 
us people with good will.  We  weren't  after them or after sa ving money or -- of changing things.  
We were there to be part of them 
and that was an important issue.  
INTERVIEWER:  What do you thin
k your greatest challenges
 were in -- in ____________?   
MR. KATZKI:  In Germany 
the greatest challenge?  
INTERVIEWER:  Once  you were in.  

MR. KATZKI:  I think the greatest
 challenge was to reinstall in 
people who had been abused for 
so long, a general feeling of worthiness and self-re
spect.  I think that was 
the first job.  You had 
to give them that before you coul
d start in with giving them me dical
 aid or -- or food or things of 
that kind, but you had to ma ke the m feel worthy 
of themselves.  And I 
think that was the big 
challenge that the JDC ha
d in the early days.  Wo uldn't you say so, Ted?    

MR. FEDER:  Well, it was a chal
lenge, but, you know, we had no for mula.  We  had no for mula.  
When you think of the ___  of people 
we had in difference from ____________ to 
____________ -- 

MR. KATZKI:  Yeah.  

MR. FEDER:  -- Lactel (ph.) came out of the ar
my as a supply officer, 
very crude, always 
cursing yet he was beloved by the people he 
was working with because they saw in him 
some thing very original and 
what they really wanted.  
MR. KATZKI:  And he wanted to help them.  

MR. FEDER:  That's -- that's al
so true, but -- but at the same  
time talking about that there was 
some thing else that was going on in the camps and th
at's a very queasy subject
 to get into, but it 
was there.  Mainly when they recognized, in th
e camps, a caple (ph.) that they had known in the 
concentration camp what to do.  Rumor had it th
at there had been people hurt in ma ny camps.  
We never found out anything on that.  The army wa
nted no part of it, but what did happen was 
that the central committee set up a code of honor
 in which those people who were accused of 
capless could face the person who 
was accusing them.  Well, this was pretty rough and -- and 
they felt they -- they had to do it.  They felt that
 they would have ability to me d out some  kind of, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
11 
 
in quotations, "punishme nt" and when I get to that you'll see how insane that was.  And -- and 
they would have -- there were 
thousands of pages of testimony by those who had been hurt and 
by the caple and then they would 
give up a decision.  What kind of
 a decision could they ma ke?   
Any decision they made against the person invo
lved us.  Involved us.  Like, the JDC will no 
longer gi ve rations to this caple.  The JDC will not
 help this man to immi grate.  Boom.  JDC will 
have this ma n evicted from the camp.  And that
 committee, the JDC.  None of them, none of 
them and we  told the committee that we were goi
ng to accept their decisions.  No one lost food.  
After all, if a ma n is going to immi grate and he te
lls the story of what it was that he did in a camp 
and the security officers except wh
at it is they say why stop them 
from -- from going?   But it is a 
very sore subject.  It was 
some thing that bothered us a 
great deal, but they had ____________.  
They had to get it out of them.  

INTERVIEWER:  How come  you kept your
 distance from the division?   
MR. FEDER:  Pardon?   

INTERVIEWER:  How come  you didn't accept t
hose decisions, those judgements?   
MR. FEDER:  Even though we saw that the people
 were the judges, the lawyers, we felt that 
there really not honestly constitu
ted.  If the military governme nt were very concerned about this 
kind of activity in so on especially the rumors 
that some  had been murdered, we felt we couldn't 
abide by it.  The JDC couldn't accept a -- a ka ngaroo courts decision.  And you know what?   

They never said a word.  When it was ____________ it was ____________.  They had had it and 

____________.  And there was no more.  

INTERVIEWER:  Herb, when you talk about one of
 the first challenges was ma king people feel 
human again, making them feel a sense 
of worth, how did you accomplish that?   
MR. KATZKI:  One way to do it was to show -- s
how them t he respect which we'd -- we -- we -- 
which ____________ do.  By helping them to set up to self organization work.  The 

____________ was a ____________ as Ted indicated he ____________ legal responsibilities.  A 

man who is a teacher did some teaching and some
body else is doctor.  He did some thing else.  
And so you did what ever you could to boost his 
self esteem.  It depended on the -- on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
12 
 
individual in the approach that you took, 
but you found some  kind of a handle and you -- you 
gave -- gave him a -- a -- a -- a 
-- boost up the -- if you ask me in
 an individual case how it was 
done, I'm not sure that I could 
answer that for you.  I could only tell you what the general 
approach was and that's -- that's -- that's the way it was done.  
INTERVIEWER:  Let me  ask you, did you have any 
kind of training for your
 field workers so 
that they knew to be sensitive 
to the ____________ or to other things?  
MR. KATZKI:  We ll, we did -- we tried to give 
them a certain amount of training -- training -- 
you train -- traini ng you couldn't give  them because
 we had no experience.  I felt this was the 

first time  in history that one wa
s confronted with a s
ituation that one -- 
one found over there and 
we didn't know what -- didn't know what to expect
.  When pe ople came in on the job they would 
come  into our headquarters office in -- in -- in 
-- New York and ma ybe they would read files and 
read re ports, so at least they would have a fa
miliarity what the kinds of problems with which 
they would be confronted.  So on. 
 But the rest of it we just to
ok our chances on the individual as 
to the -- the -- the way his value to the JDC wa
s -- was -- was characterized and we sent them 
out.  Look, we would have people who would co
me  out into the field who ma ybe came from 
Kenosha, Wisconsin or  so me  other place like that
 who'd never  been out of the United St ates.  
They would come  overseas.  They would come  in
to headquarters to get an assignment and they 

would say to the head of the ope
ration "Tell me  what I'm supposed
 to do," and the instruction 
would be "Go on out there and you will see, and you will do it."  That was all the explaining we 

got. That's all he had to work with and that what
 he had to do and that's  the way he did it.  
MR. FEDER:   But it's also true that those people 
that we gave the respon
sibility to were highly 
professional people.  Social workers -- they've b
een through the ma il. They 
have their leadership 
ability.  They move wha t  it was to be expect
ed and they also gave them good guidelines, good 
guidelines.  We couldn't tell them that if the 
police come  down and arrest one of them, that you 

go down to the police station and bail them outand use a good argument, but these were people 

who learned on the job -- 
although comi ng with ____________ I had a two and a half month 
course at the University of Maryland and 
everything from cooking 
to social work, to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336

warehousing -- I reme mb er one of the questions that
 they gave in the test wa s, "If you are in 
____________ and you get a cable that in four 
days there will be landing in ____________ 
thirty-seven tons of such, such, such procure 
warehousing and setup procedures for distribution.  
That's all.  So you had to come  up with some
thing and most people were very innovative and 
that's exactly -- let's see, who was it 
that was in North Africa -- not -- 
MR.  KATZKI:  ____________?   
MR.  FEDER:  No, no.  
Way in the beginning.   
MR.  KATZKI:  ____________?   

MR.  FEDER:  No.  But anyways, he was with
 the joint and he had been with them and I 
reme mber his getting up and saying, "I'm very pleased
 to be here to talk 
about my experiences, 
but I want to tell you that anyt
hing you have learned here isn't 
really going to help you a great 
deal.  If you think that the book 
that you have or the books that 
you will get will answer the 
questions for logist ics or procedures in handling 
large groups or contact with the military, forget 
it.  You are either going to have to have it comi ng
 out of the military or be ing innovative in or der 

to rise  to the occasion."  And the 
famous saying "play it by ear."    
MR.  KATZKI:  That's  right.   

MR.  FEDER:  That's  certainly ri
ght pertaining to that point, bu
t we didn't really send them out 
by themselves.  When you think of all the peopl
e we e mployed -- reme mb er the class too -- they 
were refugees who were given a military status
, where they could wear a uniform, the y could 
have dollars, they could have ____________ and they 
were our employees or employees of other 
agencies.  Never ____________, they've been around, they knew well what was necessary and 

our new people most did listen to them.  That was an
 important piece.  I don't want to say we had 
a trained staff, but we ha d a lot of bright guys
 around who we re able to be helpful when our 
people came in with the 
money and the food.   
INTERVIEWER:  Did the people who worked for 
you who were of the camps, teach you a lot?   
MR.  FEDER:  Sure we learned a lot, always
.  Always, you asked a question and you'd get an 

answer.  They knew, being in the camp, they 
knew everything about it.  They knew where the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
14 
 
black spots were.  They knew whom you could trust.
  They knew the people.  They lived with 
them.  They were a part of them and their information and 
their knowledge of ____________ 
was invaluable to us.  Without them we w
ould have never been able to function.   
MR.  KATZKI:  For sure.   

INTERVIEWER:  We r e  there sticky
 politics you had to wade thr
ough?   With the 
army, with any 
other aid organizations?  
 Difference between European and 
American sensibilities terms of 
approaching this problem?    

MR.  KATZKI:  I personally never had any problem
s like that in Germany in politics and so on.  
We were not a political organiza
tion.  We  prided ourselves in be
ing not political and whatever.  
So we didn't  know from politics.  So interagenc
y politics really didn't 
enter into our work.  
Certainly not in my experience.  Did 
you have anything like that ____________?    
MR.  FEDER:  Oh, we had a few little tussles 
in ____________, but that didn't ha
ve much effect.   
MR.  KATZKI:  That didn't count.   

MR.  FEDER:  No, that didn't c
ount.  If you view the groups that 
we had to associate with in 
order to get our jobs done, number one 
____________.  At first rate people in the ____________ 
departme nt ____________, would you want a 
greater person than him?   
MR.  KATZKI:  He's all right.   

MR.  FEDER:  This Norwegian was six foot eigh
t and he had also been in a concentration camp, 
____________.  So his knowledge was so vast as to 
how people reacted to whatever ma y have 
come  up, and whenever we had a problem in the 
military or with their own headquarters, he 
would help us fight our battles.  
But it's not a question of politics.   
INTERVIEWER:  One thing I'm thinking of is that
 clearly the British had different feelings 
about this immigration to ____________  than you 
did.  Did that pose any problems for you? 
MR.  KATZKI:  The British had some  curious 
ideas.  The British knew the only thing about 
nationalities, they didn't know a
nything about religious differences.  For example, a displaced 
person who came fr om Poland and was Jewish, so fa r as the British was concerned, he  was 

Polish and that he had to go back to Poland. 
 Never mi nd that the Jewish person wouldn't go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
15 
 
back to Poland at all.  So that was a big job which we had with the British when they wanted to 
____________ to the countries of their 
origin.  Re gardless of what 
their own attitudes were to 
the places from once they came and it took a great 
deal of doing to get th
em to change their 
attitude and their point of view 
to take it in to account that th
ere were differences between people 
who were Jewish, who were the subjects of all 
of this oppressive measures and everybody else.  

So that was one diffi culty that we had which wa
s ultimately over come.  That was all ri ght.   
MR.  FEDER:  We ll, ____________ was a hell of a stem
 and we used that at every turn.  And 
they couldn't stand up to it.  Although, they 
used me thods that mi ght almo st come  up to 

____________.  Not among the Jews, but among the Polish for example.  Here it was in 1945 

and the Poles still di dn't know what was the 
divisions, Russia, Poland and Germany because 
depending on where they would land they would 
go and it wasn't  until the beginning of 1946 that 
they finally got a bloody ma p and there were
n't enough ma ps for everybody, see, but by and 
large those who saw themselves in the German 
z one were ready to go.  But then there was 
some thing seemingly to hold them back and Un
rah decided with the army that every person, 
ma n, wome n and child who was returning to Pola
nd would get x-kilos of flour and sugar and 
powdered meat -- powdered milk.  And you know wh
at?   Many went simply because of that -- 
that package.  Now, I reme mber the day that 
they -- they left because it was heart breaking.  
Going back on a package.  The Russians came in
 for camp and took their own Russians.  Nobody 
said "no" to them.  And t hat was one of the r
easons I decided I was going to get out of Unrah.  
That forcible repatriation.   

MR.  KATZKI:  So that was one -- one -- one of
 the problems we had.  The other problem you 
touched upon briefl y was the British attitude abou
t admittance of people to -- to -- to Palestine 

with the white paper with their limitation 
of ____________ for five years, whatever, and nobody 
else coul d get in there and that was a problem th
at had to be dealt with, but I think that Ted 
touched upon that this morning when -- when 
he spoke about the immi gration which took place 
fr om Europe to -- to -- to Palestine the way th
at problem was -- was -- was dealt with.  The 
British -- the British I would say were very -- ve ry
, very militaristic, very -- as though they had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
16 
 
blinders on in -- in -- in deali
ng with the problems that of th
e refugees.  They only knew one 
thing.  Refugees were a burden to them and let's 
get rid of them and so they -- they moved them 
out the best way they could, the qu
ickest way they could and so on 
and they -- they --  they tried 
to oppose any opposition to that at
titude.  Obviously, opposed that 
attitude and we did what we 
could to just change --   
MR.  FEDER:  But it's also true that  of the large 
number of refugees at th
e end of the war, ma ybe 
10,000, the vast ma jority, the vast majority were 
repatriated.  That included the French and the 
Belgians and the Dutch, innocent Spaniards, but repatriation did mean the majority out.   

MR.  KATZKI:  They were going to
 western Europe ____________ country.   
MR.  KATZKI:  Okay.  But even though some  
of these -- you know, I suddenly reme mbered, a 
meeting where the Ukraine got up out of a ____________ agency meeting and was said "We will 

rema in here until the Sovi et Union falls."  You 
know, we laughed.  We said the man's mad, but I 
doubt if he went back after th
e communism is filled out.   
INTERVIEWER:  Any other real 
-- obstacles to what you were tryi ng to accomplish that you can 
think of?    

MR.  FEDER:  We ll, we were lucky that 
we never had to worry about finances.   
MR.  KATZKI:  No.   

MR.  FEDER:  There was --    

MR.  KATZKI:  That was no obstacle.   

MR.  FEDER:  There was no obstacle.  Whatever 
it would cost, cost what 
ma y and so if things 
weren't working it was our fault.  Not the fact 
that we didn't -- didn't have fun or somewhere 
the -- the line going out was bottled 
up, but we -- we -- we mentioned political.  We  never, we 
never had to face it.  I never saw it.  I 
argued with the military, Unrah, but not on an 
____________, political basis.  It just wasn't  th
ere.  Everybody went along with our basic 
modis m, basic program:  Get the people out.  Let 
them go.  Whatever.  Whatever it cost.  And so 
from that point of view we were
 really fortunate and also we we
ren't being given flack by a lot of 
Jewish organizations 
in the Stat es.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336

MR.  KATZKI:  You're sheltered from that.   
MR.  FEDER:  Pardon me ?    

MR.  KATZKI:  You're sheltered from that.  You're --  

MR.  FEDER:  Yeah, more letters --   

MR.  KATZKI:  -- overseas    

MR.  FEDER:  -- we wrote plenty 
of letters, but we weren't touche
d.  Not -- not even with all the 
political parties and their 
____________.  The ____________ and the ____________.  You 

know, --  

MR.  KATZKI:  They complained, but it didn't help.   

MR.  FEDER:  Complain.  They had to complain. 
 Who else could they co
mplain to but us?   
MR.  KATZKI:  Sure.   

INTERVIEWER:  If you had 
to think about one area th
at like a week of a ____________.  
Some thing that you -- you just couldn't achieve.  
Is there anything?   I 
know you talked about 
____________ you were, but having regrets ____________.   

MR.  KATZKI:  I think the only 
thing that we regret that we
 couldn't do was that we had 
problems getting countries to agree to issue visas to 
let people in.  I think -- 
I think that was the -- 
the biggest regret that we  had.  People -- pe opl
e just wouldn't -- wouldn't -- wouldn't accept the 
immi grants.  That -- that -- that's the one thing 
that I cant think of.  
Can you think of anything, 
Ted?    

MR.  FEDER:  No.  Although, eventually that was overcome.   

MR.  KATZKI:  Yeah, I -- I know, but --  

MR.  FEDER:  Initially, it was a problem and then 
when our people in the States went to work in 
the Jewish community in Brazil, talked to the governme nt ____________, it was worked out.  

The -- the total pi ctur e of the needs of -- of thos
e who had been left behind in Germany was very 
____________.  People reacted to it.   

MR.  KATZKI:  You had to -- you -- you have
 in general the -- th
e -- the reaction of 
governme nts with the avean
t (ph.) conference.  With the c
onference in Bermuda was suppose to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0336  
18 
 
be organized to find needs for helping people an
d instead of that they went  in with the 
preconceived idea that they can't  do anything an
d that's what came out fr om aveant came out 
from Ber muda.  Can't do anyt
hing to let people in.   
INTERVIEWER:  There must have been a re
ally good ____________, if I can use that word, to 
your whole organization because it seemed 
that functioned ve ry successfully.   
MR.  FEDER:  I --   
MR.  KATZKI:  We  --   

MR.  FEDER:   -- don't think we've ever me t some
one who worked in Germany or in Europe for 
that matter who doesn't  look back 
at that period in his life with 
-- with certain feelings.  The -- 
we were -- the linesma n (ph.) shop, the commate r y 
(ph.) of people who've been even How Trobe 
(ph.) the other day, you know, he -- he got excite
d.  They were exciting days.  They were 
productive days.  It could've been just the 
opposite, but they were 
productive because when you 
look at the bottom line some one woul
d've said "Why'd it take so l
ong? "   But -- a
nd there people 
who thought it could never be solved.  When we
 had visitors me eting with some  of the 
committees there they came  and said "How ar
e we going to solve th
is? "   So patience, 
understanding and ability 
to communicate.   
MR.  KATZKI:  Now, when you -- when you look at it from t he point of view of the 

____________.  I've ____________ a great ma ny of the -- of
 the -- of the staff me mb ers and it 
makes a small difference whether the man's a
ssignment was whether he was overseas for one 
year or for longer periods of tim
e invariably and without excep
tion that tell you that the most 
interesting and productive experience of their life
 was the time  when they were overseas with the 
JDC doing what they did.  It ma kes no difference 
what they did after they came back home .  

What -- what  level they achieved in their life.  
The JDC experienced doing this work with a most 

satisfying and productive career thei
r -- ____________ careers th
at lifes ____________.  
INTERVIEWER:  Let's  stop on that note.  

MR. FEDER:  Okay.  

INTERVIEWER:  And I thank you for 
doing this together.
