Abstract
 
Solomon Urbach was born in Kalwaria-Zebrzydo
wska in Poland in 1926. His parents and their 
six children lived in Romania from 1928 until 
1933, when the Roma nian governme nt expelled 
them as non-Roma nian citizens. The fa mily was 
imprisoned across the border in Poland until a 
Polish family got them released. 
 
 
The Urbachs settled near  Krakow in Borek Falecki. Due to anti-Semitism at the school across 
from their home , Sol and his siblings had to walk
 four kilometers to and from a Krakow school 
with only Jewish children. Polish 
Christian children threw rocks 
at them along the route they 
followed for six years. His family rema ined in Borek Falecki long after Ge rmans invaded and 
ordered them to enter the Krakow
 ghetto. But in 1942, neighbors threat
ened to report them, so the 
fa mily sneaked into the Krakow ghetto to 
avoid punishme nt for not reporting themselves. 
 
 
Oskar Schindler entered the ghetto and selected 
Solomon and a friend out of 100 others to work 
at his factory ma king pots and pans
. Schindler factory workers, who 
stayed there several ni ghts in 
March 1943 when the Krakow ghetto was liquidate
d, were the only survivors of the ghetto, as 
well as the camp he and others 
were taken to, Krakow Plaszow. 
At Plaszow, he saw Amon Goeth 
and other SS me n shoot or lynch inmates. Solom
on continues to search for fa mily me mbers, but 
found none who survived, and found only one friend after the war.
 
 
He got to know Schindler ﬁfairly wellﬂ. So
lomon was among 1,000 workers who moved into the 

concentration camp Schi ndler built near the business. ﬁI was ki nd of happy to be there.ﬂ In 
September 1944, Schindler was ordered to liquida
te the concentration camp and ship inma tes 
back to the Plaszow concentra
tion camp. In Oct ober 1944, that 
camp wa s liquidated as Russian 
troops approached, and inma tes were sent to Gr
oss-Rosen. Soon they were sent on an eight-day 
train journey into Czechoslovakia, where Schindle
r had been given a textile factory. Solomon did 
woodworking there and in Schindler™s villa. Solo
mon stole food from a mill and else where, and 
distributed it to inma tes. 
 
 
Just after the Russians liberated the camp May 
8, Shindler opened his warehouses of food and 

other material, and told the fr eed inmates to ta
ke whatever they wishe
d. Solomon and 16 others 
headed toward Krakow, where he arri
ved three or four weeks later.  
 
 

He fe lt staying in Poland was not safe , so he se
ttled in Bomberg, Germany, until emigrating to the 
United States in 1949.
 
 
Solomon sa w Schindler again in Mu
nich, and years later in 1973 in
 Israel. Schindler greeted him 
warmly, and called him Rumak, the name So
lomon had been known by. Solomon says  the 
mystery of Schindler™s
 list continues. 
 

Tape I, Side A
 
 
Today is April 8, 1992.  I am Anthony DiIorio and 
I am in Flemington, Ne w Jersey.  I am here on 
behalf of the United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum in Washington to interview Mr. 
Solomon Urbach about his experience
s during the Holocaust.  Good morning.
 
Good morning.  I am facing a difficult task because
 I have to organize my  thoughts and go back 
into a difficult periodŠbringing me  back to pr
e-war, pre-Wo rld War II and the World War II 
experiences in different concen
tration camps.  I™ll do my best.
 
Where were you born?
 
I was born in Kalwaria-Zebrzydowsk
a in Poland in October 25, 1926.
 
 
How ma ny brothers and 
sisters did you have?
 
 
We wereŠour fa mily was four brothers, two sister
s, father and mother.  My oldest brother™s 
name  was Samuel, next to him was Rivka, then I 
would be the next in line, Sol Urbach.  After 
that there wa s Chona, the sister
 younger than I am and my next
 younger brother was Haskel and 
the youngest brother was Szymon.
 
 
What was it like gr owing up in Kalvar ia?
 
 
The time of Kalvaria, as a very young person, I don™t reme mber other than later on returning on 
visits.  I remember my youth when I spent so
me  time in Romania, five years, where I was 
attending Talmud Torah and attending first grade 
of public school.  Then I reme mber traveling 
back with my fa mily to Krakow, Poland where we grew up outside of Krakow, an area known as 

Borek Falecki.  Those were the years in Borek 
Falecki, I spent the ye
ars of 1933 to 1939.  After 
1939, when the Germans already ma rched in, we 
continued living in Bo rek Falecki and even 
went on living in Borek Falecki pa
st the time when the Germans or
dered us to report to a ghetto 
in Krakow which we managed to stay away from
 for one full year until the situation got very 
difficult where the Polish neighbors would tell us that
 they no longer would be able to keep quiet 
about us being outside of the ghetto and we better 
leave the town and report 
to the ghetto.  So in 
1942, early 1942, weŠthe whole family, as a unit, that
 means father and mother and six children, 
went on and reported to the ghetto; or  smuggled 
ourselves into the ghetto because we  were no 
longer legally able to turn ourselves into the ghetto.
 
 
You me ntioned that your fa mily mo ved to 
Roma nia when you were young.  Wa s there any 
particular reason why?
 

 
It was because my mother™s brother lived in 
Roma nia and was doing real well.  Wa s able to 
support his family better than my parents were ab
le to do in Poland.  So they had influence my 
parents to move to Roma nia wher
e things would be easier.  Even
tually what happened really is 
that we spent there from 1928 to 1933 in Roma nia 
and the Roma nian government has expelled us 
as a family.  We were not welcome in Roma
nia, the Polish citizens not having a Roma nian 
citizenshipŠthey eventually got to
 us and expelled us.  I reme mb
er vividly where the Roma nian 
authorities brought us to the border of Poland and 
Roma nia and sent us across the border.  Across 
the border in Poland, the Polish au
thorities imme diately threw us into jail as a fa mily and I 
reme mber vividly the jail on the Polish side were
 the fa mily of eight of us, six young children and 
parents, were sitting in a jail cell with a high 
window above like any criminal.  Actually what 
happened is, we returned to Poland where we we
re supposedly citizens.  And it was through the 
good graces of some Polish residents in the area on
 the Polish side discovered that there was a 
Jewish family in jail, that they were able to infl uence and release us fr om jail.
 
 
So your first experience in prison and you were 
only seven years old.  And you were imprisoned 
by Poles after being expelled by Roma nians?
 
 
Right.
 
 
So you lived briefly in Ro ma nia and then, of
 course, you lived in Poland.  How would you 
describe  the ways in which Jews were treated 
in each country?   Wa s it worse or better in one 
country versus the other?
 
 
I could not ma ke a great comparison of the Jews
 and their conditions of living in different 

countries.  But in my own country, in Poland, afte
r returning fr om Romania, I reme mb er that I 
had to walkŠwhen I say I with my 
other brothers or sisters who al
ready went to school at that 
timeŠwe went from Borek Falecki to ... We  walk
ed four kilome ters daily to a school in the 
center of Krakow which was known as Mikawaraya
, (ph) (c. 78) No. 14 Public School.  This 
wasŠI did that for six years, walking the four kilome ters daily to 
that school.  The reason for that 
was while there was a school directly across from my home  in Borek Falecki, this was a non-

Jewish school and I woul d have suffered greatly. 
 Because at that time I didn™t speak the language 
and generally there was an anti-S
emitic feeling.  So we couldn™t a
ttend that school, so we walked 
four kilome ters to a school in 
the mi ddle of Krakow which hada total Jewish student body.  So 
this was a ...
 
 
So this was a Jewish school?
 

 
It had non-Jewish teachers and it was a regular p
ublic school but it was composed of only Jewish 
students, as far as I reme mber.  The walking to
 that school had to be done rain or shine, good 
weather, bad weather, winter or summer.  We  would also have an encounter on a daily basisŠ
rock throwing at us by Polish Christian kids who 
some how knew that there 
were the Jewish kids 
walking.  Or even if I was al
one, they still would 
know it and we had to go through at times, a 
hail of rock-throwers to get to 
our school.  But we did that for six years as far as I reme mber.
 
 
Were you the only one in your fa mily who went to
 this school?   Did a
ny of your brothers or 
sisters?
 
 
One brother and one sister went 
to the same  school with me .  
The others probably were too young 
to attend any school at that time .
 
 
This would be Rivka and Sa muel?
 
 
Right. 
 
 
You also attended one year of school in Roma nia?
 
 
I attended the first grade in Ro
ma nia.  After arriving in Pola
nd, the Polish authorities, school 
authorities have told us that I would have to repeat
 the first grade in Poland.  So as a result of it, I 
repeated the first grade in Krakow, Poland.
 
 
Did you have similar experiences when you went to
 school in Roma nia?   
That is rock throwing, 
or restrictions on Jewish ... ?
 
 
About the Roma nian experiences as far as being 
Jewish, I could not say much.  I don™t reme mber  
what happened there about the rock throwers or not.  But chances are they were not really as ba d 

in Roma nia.  Otherwise I would have been
 left  with some me mories of that time.
 
 
How would you describe your 
fa mily™s religious life?
 
 

We were an observant family, religiously speakin
g.  My father was at times, a cantor, conducting 
services for others.  I would at
 times be his helper but we we
re obviously not religious enough for 
our grandfather to be comfor
table in our home a nd approve 
of our religious behavior.
 
 
Was this Grandfather Urbach?
 
 
This was Grandfather Ba ldinger.
 
 
Baldinger.  Did you live with your
 grandparents in the same  house?
 
 
At the earlier stage of our lifeŠ
my mother came from Kalvaria and therefore we lived, at that 
time, with my grandfather in Kalvar ia.
 
 
But after you moved to Roma ni
a, you no longer lived with him?
 
 
No, in Romania, we were not li
ving with any other family me mber
 other than the eight of us.  
The same  when we came back to Poland.
 
 
What kind of home  did you live in when you lived in Borek?
 
 
In Borek Falecki we lived in a rundown home , actually, where the eight of us in the family lived 
in two rooms.  We  lived there for the durat
ion of 1933 to 1942 under these living conditions, was 
two rooms.  My father was a 
tailor and hardly ma
de a living.  Food wa
s certainly greatly 
appreciated when it was there.  Holidays were 
observed.  We  ma naged to go to public school as 
well as to religious schools but 
we all appreciated food all the tim
e; it was not plentiful at all.
 
 
So times we re tough economically.
 
 
Economically, times were tough as far back as I 
reme mber.  We never had it very good where we 
could move out into different livi
ng quarters.  We had to stay th
ere.  This was our life up to 1942.
 
 
Did your father work for some one else?
 

 
No, he was a tailor and he worked for hims elf.
 
 
At home?
 
 
At home .  So the shop ...
 
 
He had a shop in the house?
 
Right in the house.  The shop consisted of a sewi
ng machine and lots of threads and needles and 
that was his shop.
 
 
Did your mo ther have time  other than rais
ing such a large family to also work?
 
 
No.  My mo ther was not working outside of th
e ho me.  She was totally preoccupied with the 
raising of the six children.
 
 
What languages did your fa mily use?
 
 
When we returned from Roma nia, we all spoke
 Roma nianŠthose children 
who were already old 
enough to speak the language, spoke Roma nian.  I 
spoke Romanian and I did not speak a word of 
Polish.  Wh en we came into Poland, our language  at home was Yiddish but we also spoke 
Roma nian.  When we arrived in Poland, the school
 authorities advised us
 that the best thing 
would be if the language at home became Polish rath
er than Yi ddish to help us get along a little 
faster and learn the language.  
By doing that, one year later, I 
reme mber myself speaking Polish 
and almost totally forgetting the Roma nian language. 
 
 
Your parents, though, they ma inly spoke in Yiddish?
 
 
My parents spoke Yiddish amongst themselves a
nd the whole fa mily spoke Yiddish.  Yiddish 
was the language.
 
 
Your father also knew Polish?
 

 
My father, mother spoke Polish bu
t used theŠthe majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.
 
 
What about your father™s customers?   
What kind of customers did he have?
 
 
The customers for the tailoring were comi ng fr
om the Jewish community, from friends and 
neighbors.
 
 
What kind of schooling, would you know wh
at kind of schooling your parents had?
 
 
I have no recollection, no knowledge 
of what schooling my parents had.
 
 
Do you recall whether or not your father™s busine
ss was affected in the 1930s by any laws that 
were being passed by the Polish government?
 
 
My me mories bring me  back to the 1930s, ™33, wh
ich coincides with the rise of Hitler in 
Germany.  Also at that time, this was not too mu
ch on my mi nd, Hitler™s rise to power.  But the 
anti-Semitic situation just  was ge
tting stronger and stronger and life was a little more difficult as 

the years went by, up to the war and into the war. 
 I reme mber vividly that my father who had a 
__________ (c. 175) beard, had to get outside into the 
wall to see customers or
 walk the streets, 
he would take him a pair of scisso
rs and carry them in his pocket. 
 That was not me a nt to be there 
for his need in the trade but it wa
s in case of an attack by anti-S
emites; he would have a way of 
defending himself.  That remains in my me mory 
that he took the scisso
rs and put them away 
carefully, if he ever needed them.
 
 
So anti-Semitism was getting st ronger?
 
 
Antisemitism was getting stronger and stronger ev
ery year since 1933, which was about the time 
we arrived from Roma nia to Poland.
 
 
Did your family, your parents, ma inly, did 
they ever talk about
 Hitler, the Nazis?
 
 

I have no memories of s t rong talk about the Na
zis, about Hitler in my childhood.  Also towards 
1938, ™39, I reme mber the great conc
ern and reading papers.  I did 
not read the papers but the 
adults did and listening to the ra
dio where Poland was raving about
 its strong army and its ability 
to defend itself if attacked by the Germans.
 
 
So you were aware that there was a danger of war?
 
 
There was a danger of warŠit was in the air as 
the years got closer to 
1939 but I could not say 
that I had any great idea what it meant to me, 
my self.  The Polish authorities kept on hammering 
away that they are able to with
stand any attacks that would come
 from Germany and so there was 
no great concern really.
 
 
Did your parents ever talk about or consider
 the possibility of e migrating, of leaving?
 
 
No, we had no conversations in our house that 
I would have reme mbered about immi grating to 
any place.  Of course, if we were going to do that 
when we were in Roma nia, this was the time  to 
go towards Palestine as opposed to going to Po
land.  I don™t know whether my parents had this 
option, whether they had the means to do these thi
ngs.  They simply returned from Roma nia to 

Poland.
 
 
Would you know why your parents chose to move to
 Borek?  After the re
turn?   After you got out 
of prison?
 
 
Yeah.  The reason we returned to Borek Falecki is because we could not afford any housing in the 

city of Krakow and in fact we needed assist
ance to be able to afford any housing in Borek 
Falecki.
 
 
Your parents had never lived there 
so the goal was to move to Kra
kow or as close to Krakow as 
possible?
 
 
Yes, the goal was to somehow get to Krakow and 
that™s as close as we could get to it, Borek 
Falecki, only because the economical means were not there.
 
 
Now, what were you doing on th
e day that the war began?
 

 
September 1, 1939, the war broke out.  As I recall 
it, it was in two or 
three days, the Germans 
were in Krakow.  I reme mber going out with other 
children to greet the Germans, to get close to 
the tanks and to the trucks and shake hands a
nd everybody was jovial.  There was no fear because 
as the war approached, the conve
rsation at home was that the Ge
rmans are a more civil people 
than the Poles and actually there wasn™t much 
to fear.  So from what I reme mber from my 
parents™ conversation, we were ju
st free to go and shake the hands 
of this more ci
vil people, the 
Germans.  They would occasionally hand out some 
food to us in those early days.  Confusion was 
rampant.  My parents, along with other people, di
d not even know whether those soldiers that are 
now arriving in the first days and now are sta
tioned at the bridgesŠwhether they were Germans 
in fact, or whether they were 
English soldiers.  We heard so 
much about the English comi ng in 
and protecting us that we , on the day when they a
rrived and controlled the 
bridges and all this, we 
had to go out and take a look and find out wh
ether those were Germans or English.  We 
discovered they were Germans.  Which at th
at time made no difference to us because we 
expected ma ybe better things as opposed to
 the catastrophe
s that were waiting for us.
 
 
So at first, they behaved decently?
 
 
In the very first da ys, the group of soldiers we ran into behaved decently and handed out food and 
talked to us and laughed and we all laughed.
 
 
And there was no destruction, no combat?
 
 
No, no destruction ot her than the war was affec
ting us because now the total civil population did 
not know what to do with themselves.  Whether 
to rema in home, the bombers were comi ng over 
Poland, over our area and we did not know because of
 total confusion in Polish author ities as to 
what is best to doŠto stay home or not to stay
 home .  Or goŠwhere would you go and all that?   
So we actually, as a family, undertook to go towards 
the city of Krakow.  What sense that ma de, I 
can™t tell and it probably
 didn™t ma ke any sense but we walked towards the city of Krakow in the 
unit of eight me mbers in our fa mily along with 
ma ny, many thousands of other fami l i es.  While 
walking towa rds the city of Krakow, we walked 
in the hail of bombs 
that were falling on the 
roads and streets.  We  some how ma naged to get 
to Krakow eventually.  Then only to discover 
that that was not a safer place and th
en return back to Borek Falecki.
 
 
How about school?   Wa s school open that year?
 
 

The school was totally interrupted.  There was no
 longerŠthis was when the war broke outŠwas 
probably vacation time and the schools never ac
cepted Jewish children after that.  So my 
schooling wa s interrupted in 1939, the religious school
 was also closed so essentially there was 
no schooling at all from September of 1939.
 
 
So even your school which was most ly, enti
rely Jewish students, that was closed?
 
 
That was clos ed because there were Jewish student
s and there was no schooling at all.  It was all 
interrupted, everything was in chaos.  Jewish
 children did not have any schools to enter.
 
 
How long did the German behavior rema in civil?
 
 
Very short.  The civil behavior
 was disappearing as they settle
d down in the city and began to 
give orders on what Jews can and what Jews cannot
 do.  It wa s not much later than entering into 
1940 already where there were certai
n sections of the city off limits to Jews and we could not 
walk into it on certain streets. 
 La ter on, the orders came out agai
n that all Jews walking anyplace 
would have to wear an armband.  As  the war went on, in 1941, possibly no Jews were allowed to 

walk anyplace unless they had business and they
 would be identified 
by some armband that 
would tell whether they work in an industry that 
is important.  I reme mbe r  that my ol der brother 
wore an armband with an R.  I can™t even reme
mber where he worked, but evidently he did work 
in some  i mportant industry.
 
 
In Krakow?
 
 
In Krakow.
 
 
This would have been after the ghetto?
 
 
No, this was before the ghetto opened.  This wa
s in 1940 and ™41.  My father was limited in his 
ability to walk the st reets fr om the earlier days
 because of his beard and his appearance and the 

neighbors™ knowledge that he was Jewish.  So he
 was sort of limited.  
My mother undertookthe 
duties of providing for the fa mily as soon as the 
wa r broke out.  By appearing Christian, she was 
able to still travel on trains a
nd to go into villages and return 
home  with some  provisions, eggs 
and flour and other things that would be necessa ry
 to survive.  The children were also expected 
from the first day on, each child that was already 
grown up, maybe 12 to 13, 
to get into lines and 

stand on lines, potentially a full night into the 
day and see if they could buy a bread or other 
provisions that we needed, coal, kerosene.  So each
 child would have the duty 
of getting in line.  I 
reme mber myself standi ng on ma ny occasions on 
cold nights, winter ni ghts, waiting for bread, 
and when finally the bakery opene
d and I got to the head of th
e line, the bread ran out and I 
returned home  without it.
 
 
Was your brother, Samuel, the only one w
ho worked in a factory during these time s?
 
As far as I reme mber he had the only armband with 
an R on it.  The rest of us were unemployed.  
My father was still able to do tailoring at 
home and got some  paid for that but life was 
approaching the unbearable.
 
 
Were Germans present in Borek?
 
 
In Borek Falecki which was about four kilome ters 
outside of the city, ther
e were Germans but not 
in large groups.  They were in
 the city offices and ma naging th
e affairs of everything but they 
were not in great ma sses there as soldiers.
 
 
So it was relativel y safer to live in Borek?
 
 
It was relatively safer there and that is what led us
 to believe, that when the order finally came  for 
us to report to the ghetto that we could surv
ive some how and ma ybe wait 
out the war by living in 
Borek Falecki without reporting to the ghetto.  
Always hoping that the war will be over any day.
 
 
Do you remember when this order came  to report to the ghetto?
 
 
The order to report to the ghetto
 would have been in 1941, middl
e of 1941.  We  did not report 
until close to the mi ddle of 1942.
 
 
You were in civil disobedi
ence in the Urbach family?
 
 
We certainly were.  In fact, when theŠwhen my
 fa mily fi nally made the decisi on to enter the 
ghetto, to smuggle ourselves in, a d
ecision was also ma de that I could potentially stay away and 
not report to the ghetto, which I di
d temporarily.  A Polish employer of
 mi ne at that time, where I 
began to work as a cabine t ma ker.  Because I had 
lots of idle time , I began to observe the cabinet 

ma ker™s shop and I was there often enough to begin 
to learn the trade.  I was finally employed by 
this Pole by the name  of Ka mi nski (c. 3343).
 
 
Was this in Borek?
 
 
In Borek Falecki.  That led me  to an employme nt  
with him.  So when my  fa mily decided to enter 
the ghetto, he promised that he could help me  st
ay out of the ghetto and he allowed me  to stay 
over in his shop and sleep in his shop.  I can™t say 
whether I asked for it or he volunteered, at this 
point, but I did stay over for 
a number of nights and days con
tinuing work in this furniture-
ma king shop and staying into th
e night and sleeping at night.  
But the situation got to be 
unbearable.  I was dying of
 fear at night, sleeping in this s
hop of wood and tools, all alone in a 
large shop.  Being the youngster I was, I was si
mply dying of fear.  I saw shadows walking 
around, I saw people knocking, I heard people knocking on the doors which was all not true but 

the fear was so great that I coul
d not survive there.  Eventually I joined my fa mily in the ghetto.
 
 
So you did not go with the entire fami ly when they went to the ghetto?  You went in after a few 

days?
 
 
A few days, yeah.
 
 
What were your brothers and si
sters doing in Borek before they went to the ghettoŠbesides 
getting on lines and trying to get food and so forth?
 
 
The only one that was employed would have been 
my oldest brother, Samuel.  All the other 
children simply tried to help out at home  and do 
whatever they could in order to bring in some  

food to the house, bring in some  coal, bring in so
me  kerosene.  I reme mbe r  getting to the railroad 
station and how that was done is 
unbelievable to me  at this point
 but we some how managed with 
some  neighbors potentially to get 
on railroad cars which were tr
ansporting coal from Poland to 
some place all during the German occ upation.  We 
some how ma naged to get on these coal trains 
and throw off enough coal and gather it up into burl
ap bags and bring it ho
me  so we would have 
some  fuel.  Odd as it sounds, that™s how it was.
 
 
Do you remember what prompted your parents to 
go to the ghetto at that particular time?
 
 

The situation that ma de my fa mily rethink thei
r status outside 
of the ghetto came from neighbors 
we had known for years before the war that said th
e situation is getting r
eal bad.  That they no 
longer could keep quiet and not to report us be
cause this was already a crime on their part, not 
report that any Jews lived outside
 of the ghetto.  So they advise
d us, some  of those that were 
friendly with our fa mily, advised us to some how 
get out of there before
 things get real bad.
 
 
So it™s fear of your neighbors who them
selves were afraid of the Germans?
 
 
That™s correct.  It was not any direct order or
 roundup by the Germans that ma de us go to the 
ghetto.  It wa s fear and the 
stories that were told to
 us by the Polish neighbors.
 
 
Whereas the initial or der, the year  before, to
 go to the ghetto, that was from the Germans?
 
 
The initial to report to the ghetto was fr om th
e Germans and that would have been pastedŠ
notices were pasted on the kiosks and on some  walls
.  This was an official
 report that  we simply 
take what we  can carry with us 
and report to the ghetto.  If we di
d that at that time , we would 
have to begin our ma rch much earlier than we eventually did by hiding out.
 
 
Were there other Jewish fa milies that ignored the order in 1941?
 
 
I am not aware of anyoneŠany other Jewish families in my area. 
 Also it could very well have 
been but I don™t reme mber that.
 
 
What do you reme mber taking with you wh
en you went into the Krakow ghetto?
 
 
When we fi nally reported to the Krakow ghetto, what
 we were able to gather at home and I can™t 
say that we had very mu ch at home so we did not 
have very much to carry with us.  We were not 
burdened by any extra large amount
s of clothing or valuables and 
we simp ly had just a small 
bundle of things that we took with us.
 
 
Of course, the fa mily had no idea where they woul
d be staying when they went to Krakow?   Did 
you have a particular address in mi nd?
 
 

When we went already, we went to the ghetto, when
 we finally reported to the ghetto.  Then we 
became subject to what the authoritiesŠthat woul
d potentially be the Jewi sh author ities inside  
the ghettoŠwould assign to us as 
our living quart ers in the ghetto.
 
 
Do you remember how your father ma naged aft e rsmuggling the family into the ghetto, how he 
managed to explain to them that he needed accomm
odations?  After all, he 
had to pretend that he 
had been there all along, right?
 
 
Well, I don™t know whether he had 
to pretend thatŠwhether he di
d not fa ll into a category of 
other people returning to the ghett
o at a later date.  There is a 
good chance that there we re other 
similar situations.  But the problem that we experien
ced at that time is that we would simply be at 
the end of the line in receiving hous
ing.  A room in a baseme nt was assigned to us for all eight of 
us.
 
 
What was it like, living in the ghetto?
 
 
In the ghetto, was a total idleness 
on the part of all the family me mbers other than on different 
days.  Different me mber me mbers of my fa mily
 along with others, would be rounded up forŠby 
the Germans.  The Germans would come  into th
e ghetto and round up people and take them away 
for a daily work outside of the ghetto.  This woul
d have been to clean streets, to unload coal 
under German supervision, to do any kind of jobs that suited the Germans 
and then returning to 
the ghetto.  On ma ny of those occasions, some  of
 those people that were rounded up and taken 
out to work, people did not return.  This was simply
 instilling greater fear 
in us that one of our 
fa mily me mbers mi ght also be subject to the same
 thing.  But my fa mily me mbers did ma nage to 
return whenever they worked outside of the ghe
tto, they came back to the ghetto.  On one of 
those roundups that I was speaki
ng about, I was outside of my building when two sma ll trucks 
with Germa ns arrived in front of our building almost and simply grabbed anyone they could lay 

their hands on and pushed them into the two trucks
.  This would have been towards the end of 
1942.  They delivered us to what I later on found 
out to be the Schindler
 factory which was an 
enamel works factory, ma king pots and pans.  Th
ey simply delivered us to that camp.  I 
reme mber Oskar Schindler being there when the Ge
rmans delivered us to his yard, adjoining the 
factory.  There we were lined 
up for Schindler™s inspection.  Sc
hindler looked us over and we 
were there in a group of potentially 100 people an
d took two of us out of the line.  That was 
myself and I reme mber another friend of mi ne
 by the name  of Goodhurtz (ph) (c.496) who was 
pulled out of those 100.  Schindler sa
id to the Germans that he does not need any children.  I still 
reme mber it in German, ﬁIsh brout kine kinderﬂ 
(ph) (c.500).  The Germa ns in those days did not 
know much about OskarSchindler. 
 He wasn™t ve ry important at
 that time to them because I 
reme mber them snapping back to Schi ndler, you will 
keep what we delive red.  They departed and 

we became employees of the Oskar Schindler indus
trial complex which was at that time, making 
only pots and pans and peddling t
hose to the Polish citizenry.
 
 
This was when, when did you first ... ?
 
 
End of 1942.
 
 
And you me ntioned that the Germans would round up 
people to work on the streets.  Did any of 
your brothers and sisters get ... ?
 
 
Yeah, my fa ther, my older sist
er and brother all wound up worki
ng on occasion in different duties 
outside of the ghetto.  And then returned to the gh
etto at the end of the day.  Similarly when I was 
rounded up and delivered to Oskar Sc hindler™s fa
ctory outside of Krakow for aŠthe next few 
months we were simply ma rched out daily.  
The group of 100 was ma rched out daily under the 
supervision of SS guards, fixed bayonets.  We  we
re ma rched out of the ghetto in Krakow and 
walked towards the factory which was operated 
by Oskar Schindler.  I don™t know exactly the 
distance but it seems like a half hour to one hour 
walk from the ghetto.  This was done daily, we 
were delivered there.  In the 
evening we reported back.  Later 
on, we also broke up into shifts, 
where some  of us worked nights and some  of us
 worked days.  I happened to wind up on a shift 
working at night at Oskar Schindler™s.
 
 
So you would sleep in the ghetto during the day?
 
  
 
I would try to sleep during the day which was next
 to impos sible because we were in such living 
quarter s that the noise level and the activities si
mply did not permit me .  This was one room.  
What really was happening on ma
ny occasions, I was so tired and exhausted that I remember 
myself fa lling asleep while standing and working 
on a press in the factory of Oskar Schindler?  
Or falling asleep trying to feed the pots and pans 
into the ovens, out of total exhaustion, a lack of 
sleep.
 
 
What did you get in return for your work?
 
 
There was no pay involved.  We  were fed ther
e, at Oskar Schindler™s.  There was no pay 
involved.
 
 

What kind of food did they give you?
 
 
There was aŠas far as I reme mber, there was a 
soup during the day.  All 
the other food we would 
receive in the ghetto when we returned home.
 
 
Would they give you a ration card?
 
 
There was some  me thod of rationing.  I don™t reme
mber exactly how the food was received in the 
ghetto but there was some food received by way of ration cards.
 
 
How did the rest of your fa mily get food?
 
 
They lived on what was available in the ghett
o.  There was no other source.  There wa s no 
availability [? ].   The two older me mb ers a
nd my father were possibly receiving some  food 
outside of the ghetto.  In earlier days, there wa
s still some trading inside of the ghetto where you 
could do some  work and receive food in return.  
So we ma naged to eat and survive in the ghetto 
for the next few months.
 
 
How long did this go on?
 
 
This existence in the 
ghetto, to me  it appeared like a gian
t waiting room.  I just, you know, 
everybody was waiting for something to happen.  
We  didn™t know exactly what was supposed to 
be happening but we always hoped that ma ybe th
e war will end and everything will turn out all 
right.  But in March, potentially Ma
rch 10 or 11, while working at Os
kar Schindler™s night shift, I 
wasŠI along with the rest
 of my group, were ordered to stay 
at the factory of Oskar Schindler 
and not to return to the ghetto.  Because Schindl
er had discovered that there was an action going 
on at the ghetto, as the Germans would call it
, an action (ph) (c. 605)
 whereby there was a 
_____________ informa tion by way of Oskar Schindler w
ho brought this information back to us 
in the factory but he did not 
permit it ... (pause in tape).
 
Tape I, Side B
 
 
This is March 1943?
 
 

March 1943, it™s the 10
th
, 11
th
, 12
th
.  We stayed over at the fa
ctory, Oskar Schindler™s factory 
being fully aware of itŠthat the ghetto is bei
ng liquidated.  I personally 
being fully aware of itŠ
that my whole family is in the ghetto and not 
knowing what is happening to them.  The  Krakow 
ghetto was stilled totally and after the three ni ght
s were over, where we stayed over at the Oskar 
Schindler factory, we were ma rched back intoŠno 
longer to the ghetto but we were ma rched into 
a concentration camp outside of Krakow know
n as Krakow Plaszow.  A full-fledged 
concentration camp with barbed wires, watch to
wers, lots of busy SS people all over the place, 
totally fearsome place.  I came into this camp as
 a youngster not knowing at all where the rest of 
my fa mily is and being assigned to
 a barrack with lots 
of people, sleeping one next to the other on 
three rows high of berth or with some straw on 
it.  During the next few days, I was assigned to 
work in a stone quarry.  I worked there four da
ys, received some  soup dur ing the day.  At the 
same time, while I was in that  concentration 
camp, my beginning in that concentration camp, 
trucks were still arriving from, what was then ru
mored in the camp, as those that were killed in 
the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto.  Trucks we
re arriving with bodies 
into our concentration 
camp, into prepared open pits.  The dump trucks
 were dumpi ng the bodies and returning for more 
loads to clean up the ghetto.  It did enter my mi
nd that possibly my fa m
ily, brothers, sisters, 
parents were among thos e that were
 buried in that camp but it was 
also rumored that some  people 
survived by being shipped to other camps.  So I 
was not fully aware of what could have possibly 
happened to my fa mily.  One of theŠword got to 
me from one person that arrived back from the 
ghetto into the concentration camp that he saw my
 brother trying to run fro
m one line that he was 
in to join his fa mily and he was shot on the spot
 in the Krakow ghetto liquidation.  But other than 
this word and whether this could have beenrelied totally upon, I don™t 
know, but that was the 

only word I got from some one that supposedly saw 
my brother being shot, di
ed right there.  The 
rest of the family I had no knowledge at all.
 
 
Which brother would this have been?
 
 
Sa muel was the one that would have been shot by tr
ying to join the rest of his family.  I rema ined 
in the Plaszow concentration camp for a number 
of weeks, observing hangings, standing on the 
appel plotz during inspection time which I reca
ll as being every day during which time Goeth 
(Amon?  c. 657) and some of his cohorts 
were ma rching through th
e potentially 30,000 people 
standing outdoors for inspection.  You could ac
tually hear a pin drop because no one dared 
breathe at that time  whe n this inspection was 
going on.  Wa s total silen
ce, total fear.  Everybody 
standing numb, totally numb, not being able to sp
eak to one another.  Because while we were 
standing on the appel plotz, we were fully awar
e of the fact that Am
on Goeth (c. 664) who was 
the head of the concentration camp, the SS h
ead of the concentration camp, was ma rching 
through those lines with his cohorts.  For no appa
rent reason would shoot certain people and they 
would fall as he walked by.  At other times, th
ere were lynchings going on while we all stood 
there and observed.  All this 
was done to inst ill more fear 
into us and it was certainly 
accomplished.  We simpl y lived in daily fear.
 
 

Did you still wear your clothes th
at you had with you when you ha
d first gone to Schindler or 
were you given prison garb?
 
 
Upon arrival at Krakow Plaszow Camp, we did not
 receive any prison garb, any clothing.  I don™t 
recall wearing any unusual clot hing at that camp becau
se as it turned out to be, I was not a long-
term inmate of this concentration camp.  After a 
few weeks™ stay there and working at the stone 
quarry, the group of people that was once employe
d by Oskar Schindler was eventually ma rched 
out daily again from this concentration camp and we were returned to work at Oskar Sc hindler™s 
factory, the enamel factory.  So we would ma rc
h out daily.  Then agai
n upon return, we would 
rejoin our people standing on the appel plotz, 
be subject to nightly 
attacks by Germans comi ng 
into our barracks to take out some  people for so
me unusual work.  But basically the work outside 
of the concentration camp at the factory was work
ing on presses, steel presses, that is, to punch 
out the pots and pans.  Eventually, I was shif
ted into some  cabinet work, wood-working shop 
because of my previous experien
ce of working in a furniture shop. 
 This led me  into some wood-
working position in the Oskar Schindle
r factory.  Eventually I began 
to be in charge of providing 
all the blackout shades for the offices of Oskar 
Schindler.  It was in t
hose duties I entered Oskar 
Schindler™s office on ma ny occasions with the purpos
e of seeing that the blackout shades were in 
proper order, working order, or replacing them. 
 I would get to know Schindler fairly well and on 
occasion he  would even speak to me  and express 
some  hope that this will ma ybe end one day.  
On those trips I would also observe, those trips 
to the office of Oskar Schindler, I would observe 
that one of our inma tes, a fellow by the name  of 
Banker, would be sitting in an office adjoining 
Oskar Schindler.  Banker was the former owner 
of this factory and some place along the line, 
Oskar Schindler discovered that he could notconduct business with th
e Polish population.  The 
only way to be able to sell the 
pots and pans which we were still ma nufa c turing in great numbers, 
was to have this Banker sit in 
back of his office and conduct busin
ess with the Polish population.  
This is how the wares we re sold.
 
 
So this is the for mer owner of the factory, now being asked to he
lp the new owner of the factory 

make profit?
 
 
That™s right.  The for mer owner of the factory, 
the Jewish owner of the factory was brought back 
toŠhe was one of the earlier me mb ers that wa
s brought back to work there because Oskar 
Schindler recognized that he needs him to run th
e business.  There was potentially another owner 
in that wisk (ph) (c. 720), An
chor (c. 719) whose first name  I don™t reme mber any more.  But I 
don™t reme mber the other people involved, I only reme mber Banker.
 
 
Would you know when Banker lost his factory?
 
 

With theŠas soon as the Germans got settled in 
Krakow, they took away this factory from all 
Jewish proprietors.  They took his factory away 
fr om hi m.  As far as I know, they took this 
factory and gave it to Oskar Schind
ler as a gift to him for his prev
ious contributions to the Nazi 
party or to the Nazi effort.  And Oskar Schindler 
got this gift but didn™t 
know exactly what to do 
with it but to bring back the former owner or ow
ners to help him run th
is factory and sell the 
wares that he was producing.
 
 
What was Mr. Schindler like?
 
 
Oskar Schindler was a very impressive young man, tall, handsome .  In the earlier days, I 
reme mber Oskar Schindler actually still doing some work.  I reme mber observing him one time 

when he was doing some woodwork on a machine.  But then in later days, he became an 

industrialist and would tr
avel in company of very important
 people from Berlin. Bringing in 
people from Berlin to show them 
what he is doing here and what 
the future plans are, developing 
this seemingly unimportant complex into a f
actory that would produce materials for the war 
effort.  Many times there were very important
 engineers, with very important high ranking 
officers arriving and he would take them through 
inspections showing them what can be done in 
this place.  Eventually it was ma terialized wh
ereby he received monies fr om someplace to 

develop this factory.  He built a big offi ce buildin
g and eventually pl ans were developed to build 
a giant hangar-like building or a bi
g factory building.  In which rumo
rs were that there were some  
parts of bullets, the ...
 
 
Casings?
 
 
Casings to bullets of different t
ypes would be pressed out there a
nd this would be his contribution 
again to the war effort.  This work at the f
actory continued, for how long, I could no longer be 
sure of, but we were ma rched out 
daily, as I said before, from th
e concentration camp.  On those 
daily ma rches from the concentration camps, mo st
 of the times we were ordered by the SS guards 

in the concentration camp to pick up a rock near  
our barracks and carry it until we got to the gate.  
Then upon return from work, we would take the same
 rocks and bring it back from the gate of the 
concentration camp to a pile near 
the barracks.  This was simply to load us up and ma ke us feel 
like inmates rather  than fr ee people.  But we did 
not carry any rocks, we were simply guarded by 

SS people on the ma rch from the gate to the factor
y.  This went on for a long time potentially into 
the end of 1943.  This type of work and daily ma rching out until one day at the end of 1943 or 

ma ybe beginning of 1944, already, an English spy pl
aneŠI have to back off here.  I skipped a 
part and that is the part where 
at one point in time, Schindler 
was given permission to build his 
own concentration camp.  Some how r eceived 
pe rmission from Berlin to build his own 
concentration camp on t he grounds of the fact
ory.  Towards the end of 1943, he actually 

established barracks, built barracks and also was 
told that he can no longer employ 100 people.  

That the concentration camps that would be 
permitted on his grounds would have a mi ni mu m of 
1,000 people.  In that connection, as I me ntione
d before, his grandiose plans to build this 
arma me nt-producing factory was already on the dr
awing boards and some buildings began to be 
constructed.  Eventually, Oskar Schindler pu
lled off the shipment of 1,000 inma tes including 
ourselves, the original 100 people in the group. 
 We were housed now in a concentration camp 
adjoining the enamel factory ra
n and operated by Oskar Schindler.
  These campsŠthese barracks 
as I reme mb er were in two rows, potentially si
x barracks on a very small site were our housing 
accommodat i ons and life became mu ch more bearab
le.  Oskar Schindler would be amongst us.  
In fact, I recall when these barracks were be
ing built, the barbed wire going around the camp, 
watchtowers being constructed, I 
reme mber one conversation with 
a group of inma tes and Oskar 
Schindler in which Oskar Schindl
er described to us the need for the barbed wires and the 
watchtowers because it was going to be so good in 
this camp that some people from the outside 
would try to come  into this camp.  Neverthele
ss, the watcht owers went
 up and barbed wires 
because he obviously had to meet specifications to
 operate or to have th
e privilege of having the 
1,000 slave laborers working for his 
effort that he was going to put on for the Third Re ich.  We  
were housed there and worked there so it was no bi
g deal walking out of the concentration camp 
through a gate and walking into the factory whic
h was totally adjoining.  Worked as ma ny hours 
as the factory operated, as needed and then return
ed back to our concentration camp, which was a 
bearable place really because there wa s no one dying there anymore.  Nobody was being killed in 

that concentration camp.  I recall many ordinary
 illnesses afflicting people potentially dying but 
not because  of any hangings or lynchi ngs or 
abuse by the Germans.  The Oskar Schindler 
influence was all over the lot and 
the SS guards watching us could not
 abuse us as mu ch as they 
did in the Krakow Plaszow ca mp or in the ghetto.
 
 
How were the 1,000 selected, the 1,000 inma tes?
 
 
I have absolutely no knowledge on how they were se
lected but they came  in different transpor ts.  
At that time, they were still outlying small ghettos like Skar zysko and Wi eliczka, small ghettos of 

people where the ghettos were liquidated.  Some  
of those shipme nts from t he people surviving 
those liquidations came into our 
camp and potentially some  of them ca me  from the Krakow 
Plaszow concentration camp.  I coul
d not record it for sure.  Also 
I had some  friends that arrived 
from other camps and from other ghettos.  But th
e total count of people, where they came  from, I 
would not be aware of.
 
 
You™re still wear
ing the same  clothes that you had on?
 
 
I still recall wearing the same cl
othes.  Also sometime during the 
time  wh en we were in ma tes at 
the concentration camp i n theŠnow known as Anka F and Amalia (ph) (c. 835) somehow two 

factories combining and using the people, the 1,0
00 inma tes as their workers.  Some times during 
that time, our clot hes were cha
nged into stripes, st
riped outfits so that
 we could not escape.
 
 
During any of this time, when you first began working for Oskar Schindler, were you still 
required to wear the yellow star?   Re me mber wh
en you were back in the ghetto, you had to wear 
an armband of some sort?
 
 
No, during this stay in Oskar Schindler™s con
centration camp and factory, we were not wearing 
any armbands.  That was the time  when the clot
hes was changed into stripes and we™re wearing 
inma tes outfits __________.  (c. 848)  Some ti me s, during that time when this concentration camp 
came into being under Oskar Schindler™s influenc
e and the SS guards guarding us, there was a 
time when we underwent, all of the inmates underw
ent a tattooing process whereby the tattoo of a 
large KL was tattooed on our, if I recall, left wris
t.  The K stood for concentration, the L for lager.  
This was done so that we could no longer escape.  
It was rather large letters, ma ybe one inch or 
larger letters tattooed on th
e wrist.  I received the same  as ev
erybody else but I also traveled in a 
circle of friends who still had some  hopes of es
caping and we talked a great deal about it.  We  

could never do anything about it but
 we always talked about the 
possibility.  In that connection, 
somebody i nfor med me at leastthat
 if I sucked out the tattooing 
right after it was done, when it 
was still fresh, it would disappear.  Thereby, I wo
uld still have a chance of escaping.  Being a 
young person, naively hoping that this could happen
 one day, I did it.  Surprisingly enough, this 
came out and I never had a tattoo and to this day,
 I don™t have a tattoo and yet the friends with 
whom I survived together in this camp eventua
lly, have this large KL on their wrists.  I don™t 
have it but I know I received it and 
I sucked it out and it worked so 
well that there is no sign left 
of the KL on my wrist.  Of course, escape ne
ver came, escape never was possible and somehow I 
ma naged to get by without ever having to pr
ove that I belonged there without the KL.
 
 
Did Schindler know you by then?
 
 
Schindler would know me  a little be tter than he kne
w a lot of other inmates, ot her than ma ybe 
Banker and some  of the other officials.  He kne
w me  by sight because of the exposure that I had 
to him in that work in his offices.  It was th
e blackout shades and also worked ma ny ni ghts there 
in a building when the construction wa s going on.  
It was going on during the winter and I recall 
my responsibilities also as feedi
ng the big drums with some  wood so
 that there was heat provided 
from those burning drums.  So I had to keep the 
fire going so the placeŠso they would be able to 
work, lay bricks and a
ll that during the day.
 
 
Did he reme mber you as the Jewish boy th
at he said was too young to work there?
 
 

We never talked about it.  I never 
brought this up to him again.  I wa
s kind of happy to be there.  I 
already began to recognize that this is a better
 pl ace than someplace else so I wasn™t going to 
bring up the fact that he didn™t 
want me  as a child in his factory.  But I some how left an 
impression on him because when I met after the wa
r, he greeted me  warmly as if he knew me  
forever.  So some how, he did know me  as one of the earlier inma tes in his camp.
 
 
How long did you work there?
 
 
This existence of the 1,000 inmates in that camp
 adjoining the enamel wo
rks factory continued up 
to a time  of very late 1943 or 1944, early 1944 wh
en an English spy plane traveling over Krakow 
was shot down.  Of all the places 
in the city of Krakow, it landed
 in our small concentration camp 
which I was at this point size up as ma ybe a 
one-acre site, with six buildings, housing the 1,000 
inma tes.  It landed in our concentration camp,right on top of a buildi
ng.  Miraculously, this 
happened, as far as I reme mber, during the night a
nd those barracks were vacant.  So there was no 
one of the inma tes was killed.  I lived in an 
upper barrack which was a little removed fr om the 
site of that plane crash, or the plane that was 
brought down.  But this brought on a new situation 
because in that plane that came down in our cam
p ... I, of course, witnessed one or two bodies 
that were burned in that plane and the ammun
ition was popping for a long time out of the plane.  
When we fi nally got a chance to se e it, we saw 
either one body that was totally burned down, the 
only thing that was left wa s his 
upper torso.  Either one or two of
 the Englishmen strapped down 
and still the rest of th
e body being burned.  But the first resu
lt from that crash burned Š out of 
the six buildings that  were potentially there, ther
e were only two left.  So
 Schindler was ordered 
to return to the Krakow Plaszow concentrati
on camp, 700 of these inma
tes and only 300 would 
rema in.  Of course, all these numbers I did not k
now at that time  when this was going on.  But 
this was from stories and talk
ing to different inma tes later 
on.  The 700 people that were 
supposed to be returned to Krakow Plaszow arrive
d at a segregation or se
lection that the Germans 

conducted on the site.  Oskar Schindler was there 
but the actual selection of people unless he has 
instructed them different or made different re
quests which I was unaware of, the selection was 
done by the Germans.  During the selection time, 
I some how s e nsed and I can™t say that I knew 

anything else, but I some how sensed that I am in
 a group of people that would be returned to 
Krakow Plaszow and some how my s e nse also was 
telling me  that this was a wrong place to go.  
To this day, I don™t know what ma de me  think th
at, I did not have any previous knowledge but 
somehow something was telling me that I™m in 
the wrong place.  I have to do some thing.  My 
immediate reaction was to step out of my line w
ith the gr oup of people I 
was with, step forward, 
run towards Oskar Schindler who was, at this poi
nt, close to me .  What you got to reme mber is 
the SS guards were very strict, ve
ry business-like, with dogs, doi
ng the selection.  I some how was 
without any fear, stepping out
 forward, stepping up to Schind
ler, practically shouting to 
Schindler, Herr Schindler ________________ (c. 970).  Wh
at put these words into my mouth, 
why this was going to be so important to Oskar Sc
hindler, I have absolutely
 no idea.  I was just a 
youngster doing what seemed to me  
like very unimportant work.  Bu
t nevertheless, I did that and 
Oskar Schindler, lo and behold, inst ructed the SS guards to place me in the other gr oup.  That™s 

how I rema ined with the 300 people in the camp
 that was now two-th
irds burned down.  Two-
thirds of the people down to Krakow Plaszow, I 
re ma ined with the people in theŠin my work 
concentration camp and continued to
 work at the factory.  This pr
obably would have been better 
placed in early 1944.
 
 
Still winter time ?
 
 
Still winter time , also the weathe
r I recall as being mild.  Once th
e plane crashed, I remember that 
as being mild.  So this was later into the spri ng
time or early in fall, I could not be 100 percent 
sure.  But I would rather place 
it into the earlier spring of 1944. This arrangement with the 300 
people only limping along, working shortage of ma terials for producing the pots and pans; the 
buildings which were undertaken for the larger
 complex which was going to produce arma me nts 
or some  parts of arma me nts was no longer being completed.  Things began to come  to a 

standstill, just ma rking time .  Of cour se, at 
the time, we did not know what was happening but 
prettyŠafter a few months, by 
October or September of 1944; September 1944, Schindler was 
ordered to liquidate this concentration camp a
nd ship us all back to the Krakow Plaszow 
concentration camp.  So once ag
ain I™m with the 300 people who 
are delivered to the Krakow 
Plaszow camp and the factory, in fact, was closed
 and we rema ined for a  while in the Krakow 

Plaszow concentration camp.  This was an ex
tremely busy place now.  When we arrived there 
cattle cars we re being loaded daily, simultaneously
 the appel plotz was st ill active like before.  
We were there daily.  Hangings were at a much
 brisker pace now and during those hangings, we 
all had toŠthe inma tes that were at the 
concentration campŠhad to stand and watch the 
hangings in progress.  So me of my friends 
who were hung at that time and I witnessed and 
observed the hanging at that time
, Filledvich (ph) (c. 027) which 
was the Je wish leader of the 
concentration camp or the assist ant to the German was also hung at that time when I was there in 
that concentration camp.
 
 
Why were they hanged?
 
 
Only rumors  what we could rely on.  Why people we
re hung.  In the case of a friend of mi ne that 
went to the same  cheder, a religi
ous school that I went to before 
the war, rumor was that he tried 
to escape.  But these were all rumors.  D
on™t imagine how anyone could escape from this 
concentration camp.  Thi s was all 
surrounded by electrified barbed wi
res, with watchtowers.  We  
were, at that time, underfed, undernourished, just
 unima ginable, but neve
rtheless that was the 
rumor, that he was trying to escape.  In Fille
dvich™s (c. 047) case, the story was that he was a 
helper to Amon Goeth and Amon Goeth had a long hi
story of destroying t
hose people that were 
too close to him.  So he was one of the victim
s that was too close to him and he was hung.  But 
there were ma ny other people hung, ma ny other peopl
e that were brought in from the outside of 
the concentration camp, were brough
t in because they found them hidi
ng out or otherwise.  At the 

same  ti me , while the hangings were going on, th
ere were also shootings going on.  Ukrainian 
guard serving the Germans at 
that time was doingŠcontributing 
his killing by shooting people 
and torturing people inside the camp.  There was 
a place where this fellow by the name of Huyar 
(ph) (c.060), a Ukrainian and his cohorts would shoot
 people on that particular
 hill.  This was the 
existence in that camp for the next  few weeks 
until October of 1944.  In one of those transports 
that were going out of the camp because this cam
p was being liquidated because of the advancing 
Russian army as we would only hear from rumors
.  We  were too close to the Russian front and 
the concentration camp of Krakow Plaszow had to
 be liquidated.  Transports and killings were 
going on, as I said.  One of those 
transports, I was loaded into cat
tle cars together with other 
inma tes which I had no idea who the others were
.  Some how, we had an 
idea that maybe Oskar 
Schindler  is still alive someplace and will be bu
ilding some  concentration camp and ma ybe that™s 
where we would be going.  That™s what some  of 
us, in my gr oup at least, thought.  But we were 
thrown into these ca ttle cars, the SS guards pushing 
us, kicking us into thes
e cars.  Our railroad 
car or the transport we were on would travel a 
few days and food was very me ager.  There was no 
way of getting any food from the outside.  I don™t recall the railroad car
s being opened at any 
time.  Also I recall them being st
opped and pushed into different si
dings on that tr ip.  We could 
only surmise that some  important transport of 
Germans was going through and needed the ma in 

lines so we were pushed off the track.  But I re
ally don™t remember the railroad car being opened 
until we ar rived in Gross- Rosen.  Gross-Rosen was a concentration camp, quite a gr uesome  

concentration camp.  We  arrived there in Octobe
r, cold.  We  were received by the SS guards 
there.  I recall standing on the 
appel plotz  again c
ounting and inspections going on.  I reme mber 
a latrine that was big enough for possibly 100 people
.  Open-air latrines.  We stood there for what 
seemed a very long time .  I believe we were even
tually ordered to strip totally and in the nude 

ma rch to a delousing showering facility, a cleanin
g facility.  The guards would kick, if I recall 
correctly, these were Ukrainians 
that were on the inside of that
 concentration camp.  Ukrainian 
guards in black uniforms would kick inma tes and th
eir habit was to kick in
ma tes until they curled 
up on the ground or were too ill to respond.  I 
don™t know how ma ny peop
le died under these 
kicking outbursts but I k
now that they injured ma ny people in th
at pr ocess.  When we arrived at 
the showering process and delousing as they woul
d call it, we went through a room whereby our 
heads wereŠwe were given a crew cut and the Ge
rmans or the Ukrainian guards at that time  
would spit on our heads to give them the ability to
 shave a stripe from front to back so it would 
wind up like a one to two inch stripe running thr
ough an otherwise crew cut, there would be a 
shaved strip.  I suppose that this was done so that
 we would not be able to escape.   So in the 
Gross-Rosen camp, we received 
this crew cut and a shaved 
strip through the mi ddle, running 
from front to back of the head.  The situation in
side the Gross-Rosen camp, as I described before, 
whenever there was a chance for the Ukrainian guar
ds to kick anyone, they enjoyed that.  I don™t 
recall any killings or hangings inside that camp.  The whole group 
that I arrived with was in a 
barrack that potentially could ha
ve held a couple of hundred people.
  It seemed like all the seven 
hundred of us were held in this one barrack.  One 
other thing I recall is in front of theŠthe entry 
of the barrack, there was a me ticulous room wh
ere the SS guards or the Ukrainian guards would 
be standing by watching us in the rest of the ro
om. Everything in that entry room wa s me ticulous, 
was pots and cooking ware and all this.  It just
 looked like a little showplace until you got to the 

rest of the ba rrack where we were housed.  Th
ere was not enough place for people to be housed.  

All those 700 and the only way we could be inthat room would be by sitting on the floor and 
sitting in one another™s lap.  The 
clothes we received now at that delousing was simpl y one shirt 
and some how I don™t recall any other clothing that 
we received.  We  simply received one shirt 
and we were walking around in that one shirt, si
tting in one another™s lap in that Gross-Rosen 
barrack.  This lasted a few days, possibly a wee
k.  The only food I reme mb er being given in that 
Gross-Rosen campŠnumber one, some  of us were 
awakened at some  hour like four o™clock in 

the morning.  This was winter approaching so it seemed like a deep–
 
 
Tape II
 
 
Were you required to perfor m work a t  Gross-Rosen?
 
 
I don™t recall any work being required of us, ma ybe, not all of us.  I personally don™t recall doing 

any work.  It was kind of idleness, sitting and th
e situation began to look very desperate.  We  
forgot about Oskar Schindler.  Or
 at least I was unaware of anyt
hing of what™s happening with 
Oskar Schindler, which was still in the back of our
 mi nds when we traveled in the cars.  But at 
this point, desperate–Al so one othe
r thing that I noticed was that th
e 700 of us that were in this 
barrack were no longer the same  group of people w
ith whom I worked back
 in Poland at the 
enamel works.  It looked like 
a total stranger group.  Some  of 
the people that I knew were still 
there but mo st of the people were mi ssing from th
is original group.  In fact, some  of the friends 
that were with me  in that time, in Krakow, were no longer here in Gross-Rosen.  So some how, it 

looked like a different mi x of pe
ople except for a smaller group of us that worked for Schindler 
and were still here.  So that I 
did not know of what  is happening
 to us and I did not know what 
the future is bringing.  One occasion, I recall, 
I could not find myself a place, some how arrived 
late in the ba rrack and everybody was already sitti
ng in one another™s lap.  Wa lking in I just  
couldn™t find a place so the guard, the Ukrainian gua
rd, with a nightstick in
 his hand, went after 
me  to find myself a place.  I couldn™t becaus
e everybody was sitting tight.  So I recall jumping 
over people, running to escape from him and hi m 
running with that nightstick and just hitting 
whatever came along.  On the way of chasing me , 
he probably hit many people.  I eventually 
found a place to collapse into and the chase was ov
er.  After a number of nights and days of this 

terror-ridden concentration camp, we were sittin
g assembled as I described before in one 
another™s lap.  Some how, the guards came in with a 
list and began to read name s.  Where this was 
leading to I didn™t know but ever
ybody was hoping to some how be on that list.  Whatever this 
was turning out to be, it seemed like getting out 
of here some place or doing some thing else was a 
relief so everybody was extremely anxious to hear
 his name .  I recall being extremely anxious 
because my name starts with a U and so this re
ading of names seemed like a whole ni ght proc ess 
and my na me just was not comi ng up.  Eventually 
it did get to my na me and after all the names 
were called out ...  Up to this point in time, th
at is 1992 in Flemington, I have absolutely no idea 
where these names ca me  from.  Now the only thing 
I can suspect is that some how when we left 
the Krakow Plaszow concentration camp, some b
ody submitted a list of name s to some German 

authorities and the pin leisheit[? ] (ph) (c. 52) 
of the German a uthorities some how led them to 
forward this list of people that 
are evidently destined to go into 
Oskar Schindler™s factory again.  I 
don™t know, I can™t tell it for sure
 but I do know that in Gross-Ro
sen there was a list from which 
the Ukrainian guards were readi
ng.  As I said before, probably, since 1941 or even since the 
beginning of the war, I don™t ever recall havingto give anybody my na me .  I don™t recall, ma ybe 
in the ghetto, when we arrived in the ghetto, we 
would have given name s but other than that, we 
became totally nameless people.  I don™t recall 
anybody ever requiring of me  to give him my 
name .  But nevertheless, in Gross-Rosen, in the c
oncentration camp there, th
at particular night all 
the names were called,  As I said before, most of the names were not familiar to me.  They were 
people simp ly that came from the Krakow Plas
zow ghetto and were no longer the same people 
that were  working with me  in the enamel work
s at Oskar Schindler in 
Krakow.  My name  was 
eventually called.  Eventually all the names we
re called and we were loaded into carloads, 
railway cars again, and shipped to some where.
 
 
Of the few people that you reme mbe r ed from theenamel factory that were still with you, were 

they also on this list?
 
 
Yes.  Those few people that I recognized, that I 
knew, were from the list ofŠor were from those 
people that worked for Oskar Schi
ndler before.  But the bulk of them wa s not.  The bulk of them 
simply ca me  to this Gross-Rosen camp by some  
knowledge that this was going to be a shipme nt 

to Oskar Schindler™s concentra
tion camp where the survival chan
ces were the greatest .  I was 
totally unawa re of it, being th
e youngster.  I was simply probably amongst this gr oup because of 
my stepping forward at one time inŠto Oskar 
SchindlerŠwhere Oskar Sc
hindler placed me  in 
the group that would 
eventually survive.
 
 
When were you transferred out of Gross-Rosen?
 
 
Gross-Rosen, we were transferred 
after a week™s stay.  We  were 
shipped out ofŠby railroad cars 
again.  I think that this time th
e railroa d cars again traveled seven, 
eight nights, eight days, into a 
place thatŠi n Czechoslovakia, deep in Czechoslovaki
a.  The name  of the town was Brinlitz (ph) 
(c. 87).  We were marched from the railroad cars
 to a factory some place in the vicinity.  I don™t 
recall the distance of that
 march.  But at this time, we were 
700 of us that left Gross-Rosen. And 
700 of us, males only. I don™t recall any wome n in Gross-Rosen. Als
o, they could have been there 
in a different barracks.  But in our situation, I 
only recall ma les.  We  wereŠwhen we arrived, 700 

of us were ma rched into this factory which look
ed like an old factory th
at what™s that called 
_________?
 
 
You mean a warehouse?
 

 
No, where they ma ke materials.  Linen ...
 
 
Oh, okay, textiles?
 
 
Which looked like a textile factory. 
 We were ma rched into that th
ing and if I reca
ll correctly, we 
were greeted by Schindler when we arrived on that 
site.  It didn™t look like 
a concentration camp.  
It simply looked like a textile 
factory.  The building was text
ile machinery but it was fairly 
obvious at that time  that Oskar Sc
hindler received this factory agai
n as a gift and he was going to 
convert this textile factory into some  kind of an
 arma ment factory.  How this was to be done, I 
don™t know.  None of us had any 
training, none of us was skilled 
workers, at least that I was 
aware of, in that area.  But Oskar Schindler
 evidently received permission to build a 
concentration camp.  Bar bed wires we nt up, watcht
owers went up and the German contingent of 
SS guards to watch us was in place.  If I reca
ll, this was not an extremely large gr oup of SS 
guards.  If I had to place a number on them, 
it would have been 50 or 60 SS guards being housed 
in one barrack.  We  were being housed in 
the upper floor of this textile factory.
 
 
Were all the SS Germans?
 
 
It looked at that time like all the SS were German
s and also, one additional f
actor that I noticed at 
that time were that  these SS Germans were olde
r people.  They were no longer the younger, full 
of spic and span and polished.  They were tire
d old people that were in the SS unifor ms watching 
us.  This factory began to take shape and 
some  work was being done, disassembling the old 
textile factory.  Shortly after we arrived in 
this camp, a group of 300 
women that evidently 
underwent exactly the same  thing in Auschwitz wh
en we we re being tran
sported from Krakow 
Plaszow to Gross-Rosen, evidently these wome n 
were shippe d to Auschwitz.  It  was fa irly 
obvious that this group of people was some howŠalso
 arrived in Auschwitz 
was a list.  Some how 
by name , were called out by name  from Auschw
itz and set on a march from Auschwitz to 
Brimletz [? ] (c. 130).  So 300 wome n arrived in Br
imletz in a much worse situation than we did 
because this wasŠcould have been Oc tober, 
Nove mber of 1944.  They were set on a ma rch, 
marching from Auschwi t z to Brimletz and being 
guarded by Polish-Ukrainian convicts that were 
set in charge of those wome n to ma rc h them towa rds the camp , these official guards were brutal 

during the route to those wome n on the ma rch from 
Auschwitz to Brimletz.  But eventually they 
arrived in Brimletz and a small section of this
 housing or the textile factory was surrounded by 
barbed wire.  The 300 wome n lived in the same  
complex with us but being separated from the 

me n by barbed wire.  The productivity in this 
particular camp was not of great value as it 
appeared to me  because dismantling, shifting ar
ound, building of offices for Oskar Schindler and 
his staff that evidently was meant to appear as if
 he was going to do great things for the German 
effort .  
 

 
I wound up working in one of the buildings th
at was renovated into aŠoffices for Os kar 
Schindler.  I reme mber doing pine
 paneling and since there was a s
hortage of ma terials we used a 
torch to sort of burn lightly the pi
ne materials so that it would app
ear like a finished material.  But 
actually, it was simply scorched from the flame of the torch and we eventually wound up 
constructing some  offices for Schindler that wa
s very impressive looking.  The factoryŠI don™t 
ever reme mber doing any work that would have 
been close to what the Germans we re hoping for 
but we were kept busy.  Some  
woodworking shop was in existe
nce.  Everything on the inside 
looked rather peaceful.  The SS guards were some
how led to believe  and understand that their 
duty is only to keep us from escaping.  I don™t re
call any torture or anythi
ng that these SS guards 
would inflict on us.  There were 
occasional shipments that were ar
riving in the camp, of Jews that 
were evidently rounded up as escapees someplace 
or potentially from liquidating small groups of 

inma tes.  Those were arriving at our doors or in
 our camp in horrible desperate situation.  We  
occasionally had to go to the railroad cars and open them up; pry them open to get to the people 

on the inside.  We  would occasiona lly find dead peopl
e, people with frozen bodies to the railroad 
cars, torn pieces of flesh from them from the frostbites.  There were not gr eat numbers that were 
arriving but those that we re arri
ving from some other sources were
 in desperate situation.  Many 
of the people were buried there on 
the inside of the campsŠof that camp that I was in now.  I, 
along with another friend of mi ne who was also
 a woodworker like myself, we were assigned 
now to renovate a villa that was 
given to Oskar Sc hindler at his re
sidence.  The villa was outside 
of the camp or ma ybe some  distance away, ma ybe 
a 15, 20 minute walk to that villa.  The villa 
was located on the insi de of a mill.  I recall al so
 it was behind a canal, water and a br idge leading 
up to his villa.  But fr om this villa, you could wa
lk out to the mill and be inside the mi ll.  It  was 
obvious that this villa once belonged to the owner of
 the mill, a rather large complex.  In the mill, 
there was flour and oatmeal and stuff like that.  
Schindler™s villa appear
ed like an unoccupied 
building also.  Once in a great while, we would no
tice Mrs. Sc hindler being 
there.  I don™t ever 
recall him being there but our assignme nt was 
to polish his furniture, clean up the villa, do 
whatever we thought, the two of us inma tes from
 t he concentration camp, thought can be done to 
improve Mr. Schindler™s residence.
  The two of us were ma rched daily out of the concentration 
camp on the textile groundsŠthe textile fact
ory groundsŠwere ma rched out daily by two SS 
guards to that villa.  On occasion, so one SS gua
rd would lead us out and things wereŠseemed 
rather norma l.  There wa s no great fear of escapi
ng and the SS guards, as I me ntioned were older 
people.  Some how, it just began to feel like some
thing is comi ng to an end.  It is no longer that 
fearsome  kind of concentration camps that I was in
 before.  It some how had the appearance of a 
more relaxed situation.  In fact, the SS guard or
 the two SS guards would come  into the villa and 
would sit down on a sofa and the two of us were
 pretty much free to do whatever we thought we 
should do, polishing, ma king believe that we™re po
lishing.  Occasionally working on some radio 

where we would turn it on and 
hear BBC talking about the trem
endous losses that the Germans 
are undergoing.  We  would be able 
to bring that news back to the camp.  The reason we  were able 
to hear this occasionally, listen to the radio o
ccasionally, was that the SS guards who came in to 
watch us, either one or two of the m, would sit down on the sofa with their carbine or bayonet 

between their legs and they would doze off and went
 into deep sleep.  We  were able to simply 
roam around that building and do what we thought
 should be done.  On nume rous occasions, I 

would even be able to jump out of the window of 
that villa.  As I descri
bed it was located inside 
of a mill and some how make my way into one of
 the mill buildings where lots of stuff was 
beingŠwas laying around.  I was able to go in 
these buildings, these warehouses, and by that 
time I learned the trick of tying my pants at th
e bottom, whatever pant s I had at that time and 
filling up my pantsŠ
 
 
Pant leg.
 
 
Pant legŠwith some  stuff like oatme a l, cornmeal or
 something like that.  With that I came back 
into the villa, acted as if I was nowhere, did 
not get out of the building and the SS guard didn™t 
even know the difference.  That ma terial that I 
stole from the mill, I, on occasion, I would walk 
with those pant legs tied at th
e bottom with stuff in them.  Or 
by that time, I had a toolbox which 
I ma naged to build a fake top whereby on the top 
I had some tools laid out.  The inside of the 
box, was a rather large box, would hold all that ma te
rial I stole from the mill.  With that I was 
able to pass through the guards in
 theŠwhen we were ma rched back to the campsite.  In the 
campsite, I was able to give out all 
that stuff that I stole.  I became quite good at it.  I was able to 
hand this out and there were many occasions where 
people would, the inma tes that is, some  of the 
inmates became aware of it, that I am in this en
viable position.  I was having all this foodstuff and 
some  people would approach me  because of an illn
ess of a particular inmate or a relative and I 
became a person much in demand by giving out that
 food to other inmates.
  On many occasions, I 

also stole other things.  It some how a ppears that
 I wasŠbecame  an i mpor tant inma te because of 
my e mployment in Oskar Schindler™s villa.  
So I was some how treated and was able to, on 
occasions, steal things from carload
s that were passing by or arrivi ng.  I would also be  able to 
hand out these things, as I said, 
to friends.  But on ma ny occasions, I was able to sneak these food 
ma terials, foodstuffs, into the wome n™s barracks which was simply a way ...  The way I got that 

into the wome n™s barracks is by throwing it ove
r those barbed wires.  I some how ha d the 
freedom, so did my friend who worked with me  
at the villa, to do that.  On one of those 
occasions, I was discovered that I 
am bringing in foodstuff from th
e outside  and that I ... That 
some body t hrew over some  food into the wome n™s barrack
s.  I recall at the gathering, at the appel 
plotz  in this case was heldŠthe
 gathering of all the inma tes fo
r counting purposes and all that 
was held inside of this factory building.  One 
of those inspections, the head of the SS guards, 
whose name  I don™t recall at the moment, ca me
 to the appel plotz  and yelled out, ﬁ
vaw zi n 
______ _______ﬂ
 (c. 288).  That means where are those 
people that were inside the wo me n™s 
barracks?   Evidently a woma n SS guard who watc
hed the wome n™s quarters noticed us and we 
were reported.  The two of us were reporte
d for being at one time inside the wome n™ s 
 
 
 
quarters.  As I said before, on ma ny occasions 
I would do thatŠI would 
some how make my way 
into the women™s barracks, either throwing it over
 or getting in there an
d giving away all that 
foodstuff that I had.  I have neve
r received anything from anyone for 
the stuff that I gave out.  It 
w a s  s i mp l y  a  v e r y  e n j o ya b l e  mo me n t  fo r  me  t o  b e
 able to do it.  I™ve never asked, never received, 

never knew of anything I could have 
asked or could have received.  So
 at this appe l pl otz, this SS 
guard, head of the SS unit, is yelling ﬁ
vaw ___ ____ ______
ﬂ
 
(c. 305).  Out of fear, I did not step 
out.  At first, neither did my friend.  But ev
entually, it appeared very serious. Some body could 
pay for it if we didn™t step out.  We
 did step out finally and we said
 we were the ones that were in 
the wome n™ s barracks.  As it turned out, he di
d not possess, this SS guard, did not possess enough 
authority to punish or hang us or punish us 
in any way.  All he wanted to know was who 
permitted usŠwho let us into the women™s barracks.  These were reactions that we had to rely 
on, both my friend and myself, and our reaction wa
s to simply point at two SS guard women who 
were at the door and they saw us
 going in.  At that point, if th
ere was any punishme nt unleashed, 
it was on the two SS guard wome n opposed to us.  We
 were permitted to re-joi n our ranks and we 

were not punished at all for violation.
 
 
Not even for stealing food?
 
 
No, we were not punished for anything.  Now, as 
I said before, this was 1945 already.  It wasŠ
some how the air was filled with something goin
g on.  There were ma ny demonstrations of that 
already.  I recall one day when we 
we re all told to stay in our 
barracks, not to step out.  I 
reme mber looking out the barracks where Schindler 
was ordered to appear to some  authorities, 
outside of the camp obviously, to some  authorities 
in Prague or outside of
 Prague.  We can only 
go by stories that were circulating amongst usŠone
 story was that Schindler was called in to 
explain how it is that the inma tes inside th
e camp received some  
food whi l e the population 
outside is now being starved.  Th
e Czechoslovaks that were free supposedly did not have as much 
food arriving into their homes as we were getting 
into the camp.  I recalldistinctly being in the 
barracks, nobody went out to work anyplace and ev
entually after ma ny hours, Schindler arrived 
back from that appearance before some  authorities
 in a total drunk state. 
 The engineer with him 
wasŠas I said we were inside the barracks looking out, looking for some  signs of what is going 

on.  Nobody bothering us inside the camp at all, 
the SS guards being outside.  Schindler arrives 
with this engineer of his and we hear him distin
ctly pointing at the end of the camp, ordering this 
engineer to build a fence, a very high fence w
ith corrugated metal solid 
so the outside residents 
would not be able to look inside
 to see that we have food in the camp whi l e they don™t have any 
food.  That fence actually went up.  He ordered th
e engineer to do that and that fence eventually 
went up.  Where in time this was, I don™t know, but weatherwise that I would reme mb er, it could 

have been maybe already April of 1945, that this
 was happening.  It appeared that the SS guards 
were totally under the control of Oskar Schindler.
  So the fence went up and there was peace.  
Also rumors were beginning to 
circulate that all this food and 
some ti me s carloads of colorables 
(ph) (c. 376) or other foodstuff, bread would arri
ve in large numbers into the camp.  The rumor 
had it that Oskar Schindler was stealing those at 
the railroad st ation and was able to commandeer 
things to bring them into the camp.  There wa
s total chaos among the Germans and he appeared 
as the highest ranking officer when he put on hi
s SA unifor m.  He had a bunch of decorations on 

him that he obviously appeared like the ma n in charge
.  Wh en he went to the railroad stations and 
ordered things to be loaded on 
cars and shipped to his camp or 
wherever he ordered them, he 

some how succeeded in that.  It is also my unde
rstanding that, on occasion, he would unseal some 
railroad cars that had some  ar ma me nts or parts 
of ar ma me nts.  He was able to unseal those and 
put his own seal and his own na me  on them as if
 he produced those things and shipped them on to 
the German hierarchy.  All this was going on.  Insi
de the camp, things were 
bearable.  I continued 
my work at the villa bringing back news that 
things for the Germans are turning bad.  The BBC 
talking about the Americans, the English suc
cesses.  Eventually on 
May 8, Schindler called 
together all his inma tes.  I have to correct 
that.  On May 7, Schindler called all his inma tes 
together into this, what used to 
be the appel plotz, inside the f
actory building.  Wh
en we were all 
assembled, he pointed to his open door in his own 
office, inside the factory and he said I have 
assembled 30 revolvers in thatŠthey were all on th
e table in his office.  For those of you who 
know how to use them, you should distribute th
em a mongst yourselves and begin protecting 
yourselves.  Because all the SS guards from th
e camp are gone.  Rumor later on had it that 
Schindler faked an order for them to leave the ba
rracks and imme diately report to the SS units in 
Prague.  So that he announced to us that we 
are no longer being watched 
by SS guards but there is 
a potential of stray German units
 coming through this area that coul
d still hurt us unless we begin 
to protect ourselves.  Additionally, he said I have to leave this camp.  I have to leave this factory 
imme diately.  Because if I stay here this is 
deep in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslova ks would 
treat him as a German authority.  He could poten
tially face trouble because since hi s or iginal 
contributions to the Germans took place inside Czechos
lovakia.  So he was in danger of his life 
and he asked that some  of our inma t e s volunteer 
to help hi m get across into some American or 
English zone.  Some  of our inma tes, there were 
two or three that steppe
d forth to help him get 
him across into the English zone or American zone
, did take place.  Schi
ndler left and we were 
left insi de that concentration, insi de that factoryuntil the next  day.  On that appel pl otz  he also 

announced to us that the Germans wi ll be signi
ng a surrender tomorrow.  This was the 7
th
 and he 
told us that by tomorrow the Germans will be  si gni
ng a surrender and that the war will be over.  
He announced those words to us.  The cries, th
e laughs, the outbursts that went up from our 
people is still vivid in my me mory until today. It was just a scene of unbelievabl e confusion, 

happiness, unhappiness, everything mi
xed together as this develope
d.  The next day, as Schindler 
promised, we did not hear about any announcement of
 surrender but we did see a Russian soldier, 
a single Russian soldier that looked 
like he was 20-foot tall on a horse that was extremely small.  
At least that™s how it appeared to me at that 
time, ma rched into our camp and declared that the 
Germans are no longer here, that th
e Russians have ma rched in here 
and that we are free people.  
We rema ine d in there because we had no guidance 
from anyone inside the camp other than to 
protect ourselves.  We  really did not know what 
and whenŠsome of our people were sick, weak.  
We did not know the next step i
mmediately.  Some  of the older 
inma tes knew that amongst us are 
some  of those Ukrainian, Polish guards that br
ought the women from Aus c hwitz to our camp.  
These inma tes of ours wanted to know from the 
Russians what we should do with them.  Because 
now, evidently, they had an eye on them and took th
em as prisoners.  They wanted to know from 
the Russians what we should do with them.  The 
Russians evidently gave our inma tes permission 
to deal with them as we see appropriate.  So 
some of those inma tes that were now held by the 
for mer prisoners were actually hung 
on the factory pipes right after the war.  We  eventually were 
freed and upon Schindler™s leaving he
 also pointed to us, pointed out
 to us that he has warehouses 
full of stuff.  As I spoke about this, he was able
 to organize those by going
 to the train stations 

and ordering things to be shippe
d wherever he desired.  In this 
he had warehouses full of stuff.  
Full of liquor, full of foodstuffs, he had ma terial
s, he had clothing, he had house shoes as I recall 
and all those.  He told us in
 his parting me ssage that all th
is should be divided amongst the 
inma tes and we should do it as fast as we can beca
use the Russians are ma rching in here and there 
is a good chance that they would take  this because they needed it probably almost as much as we 
did.  So some of our inmates took charge imme
diately of those revolvers, of thoseŠof the 
ammunition that was available and we  were obvi
ously protected.  No one was harmed by stray 
German units.  Schindler has left and we were now
 being dispensed all those ma terials that were 
in warehouses in that factory.  
I receivedŠI recall receiving some
 shoes, some  house shoes, some  
ma terials that I eventually could ma ke a suit 
and some  other stuff which I don™t recall at the 
mome nt.  But eventually we were free and it also
 appeared that everybody was totally on his own.  
There was no authority, no Russian authority di
recting us anyplace, no Czechoslovak authority 
directing us anyplace.  We just 
had to follow what our own imaginations would guide us to do.  I 
joined a group of 17 people that is 13 me n, four
 wome n, that evidently selected Krakow as our 
destination and we would begi
n a march towards Krakow.  We simply l e ft the camp under no 
one™s guidance, with lack of knowledge of wh
at we™re going to have to pass through, whether 
there was still some  fighting going on anyplace. We nonetheless left the camp, 17 of us.  We  

were able to round up a horse and wa gon.  The horses 
at that time were simply roami ng the fields, 
some  of them being injured from the war.  Some  of them si mply left by fleeing German units.  

They were simply roa ming the fields.  We  were 
able to take a horse or two and a wagon.  Load up 
on this wagon whatever ma terials 
we just received from the ware
houses of Oskar Schindler, take 
those with us.  Those of us that were stronge
r would ma rch behind the wagon.  Those that were 
weaker were on the wagon.  We  would exchange 
those that we re riding 
and those that were 
walking.  We did that for the next seven days.  
The horses would not last that long because they 
were injured horses.  So during th
at ma rch of the  seven or so da
ys, we would have to exchange 
these injured horses for other injure
d horses to pull our wagon to help
 us get to our 
destination of 
Krakow.  We never reached Krakow
 itself.  We  went as far as 
Vruzwuff ( ph) (c. 588) which was 
a for mer city of Breslow, a Ger man city.  When 
we got to Breslow, there was some  semblance of 
norma lity already existing there.  There were alrea
dy resi dent s tryi ng to rebuild the city.  All the 

outskirts and railroad cars and th
e city itself of Breslow were 
totally destroyed during the war 
from bombardments.  I recall buildings that we
re totally dest royed, with just one room still 
functioning or some thing.  We  were accommodat e d 
in those bo mbed-out buildings.  Eventually 
from Breslow, (c. 605) I would have to think that
 I was able to eventually get on a train and go 
from there to Poland and eventually wind up in Kr
akow.  Potentially, three or four weeks after 
May 8, the end of the war, I arrived in Krakow.
 
 
What did you find there?
 
 
Some how within the next  fe w days, we all went 
out on our own in search of fa milies.  Whether 
fa mily me mbers of oursŠas I me ntioned all of 
our group, all of the 17 people went out on their 
own.  I traveled back to Borek Falecki imme diat
ely and inquired of neig
hbors, of my for mer 

employer whether he has seen any one of my family
 me mbers.  No one was able to shed any light 
on that.  The situation was very difficult for me  to
 rema in in Borek Falecki because it just seemed 
like it was unsafe yet because of the anti-Sem
itism which didn™t some how disappear with the 
war.  From word that we  got from other Jewish
 me mbers who traveled to
 different locations of 
their homes and they felt extremely unsafe.  Base
d on that, I also felt unsafe and returned back to 
Krakow.  By that time, I discovered that some  
of the people from the 17 
people that I returned 
with, had found some  re latives either close ones or 
distant ones and in fact I discovered that I was 
the only one of that group of 17 th
at so far did not find anyone, dist
ant relative or close relative.  
Eventually, one of the 17 people wa
s able to find a place for me  to stay with them in a one room 
situation where it seemed like ma ybe 20 or 30 pe ople that had no place to go, were 
accommodat e d by this one person in Krakow.  In Krakow, the organizations, Jewish 

organizations, UNRRA, other organizations became  
active and sent out calls for people to begin 
to look for lists at certain places of people who surviv
ed and returned.  So that  we will be able to 

look whether any of our relatives returned from t h
e war.  This was my da ily function, to go to 
those places and look for lists up and down.  I did 
not find names of my fa mily on any of those 
lists.  Eventually I was assigned some  housing in
 Krakow itself where my
self with three other 
people lived in one room which was formerly a st
udents™ building in Krakow.  On one  of those 
daily trips to these schools or gathering places 
where they were bringi ng in some inma tes from 

some  concentration camps like Mauthausen, ot
her _______ (c.652), Auschwitz...   By that time, I 

already gave up or did not have any hope any mor e  
that any one of my family me mbers is alive.  
This was already going on a few we eks into post 
war and no one was appearing.  I practically 
gave up hope.  But on one of those trips I found 
a bunch of returnees from Mauthausen and I 
some how had knowledge that one of my close fr
iends, a fellow by the name  of Ada m  Mondel (?) 
(c. 659) was in Mauthausen when we were separa
ted once before in Krakow Plaszow.  We  were 
close friends and I some how understood that he went
 to Mauthausen.  So in this transport of 
people that arrived from Mauthausen, those that su
rvived, and they were all very ill.  When I 
arrived in this school building wh
ere those survivors arrived, they 
were all sitting or laying on the 
floors, very poor shape, very bad health wise. 
 I already had eaten and 
I already had clothing by 
that time but those people were in horrible shap
e.  Some  of them not even reme mbering their 
name s.  So I  along with another friend of mine began walking through those survivors of 
Mauthausen and shouting Ada m 
Mondel (ph) (c. 670) loudly.  
Would this friend of ours be 
among those survivors?   Because no one was 
recognizable, really.  We  couldn™t recognize 
anyone.  Poorly clothed, poorly fed and in real
 bad shape.  So that the only way we could 
discover whether anyone we know was there, wa
s to yell their name  and ma ybe some body would 
respond.  Sure enough on one of those trips, I wa
s there with a friend yelling Ada m M ondel, and 
a fellow answered to that name .  Stood up, unfol
ded from the floor and stood up.  That was my 
friend, Adam Mondel.  This was about the closest 
that I came to seeing any one of my friends.  
Relatives were noy found by that time and no one wa
s ever found from my relatives.  But this 
was the closest friend that I f
ound and the only close friend thatI found that I knew from before, 
Ada m Mondel.  Took him with me  out of this 
waiting room in the school and he began living 
together with us in that building, in
 that students™ building in Krakow.
 
 

As far as you can tell, your fa mily was k
illed during that liquidation of March, 1943.
 
 
Yes, as far as I can ascertain.  At this point fr
om reading different ma terials, from talking to 
for mer residents of the Krakow ghetto; very few 
people from there went from any place else but 
to Krakow Plaszow.  Some  few only went to Kr
akow Plaszow and only us, the ones that worked 
at the Oskar Schindler factory 
and held overnight, those were 
the only ones who survivedŠthat 
survived that camp.  To the best of my knowledge
, at this point, no one left from there to any 
other camp.  Simply was  killed in the ghetto itsel
f.  All the shooting and all the killing was done 
inside the ghetto.  Those transpor ts never left an
y place at all.  So I have ne ver found anyone from 
my fa mily, not even from distant relatives.  To
 this point, I always look through books and lists.  
But at this point, in 1992, I still 
have not found any close relative of 
mi ne that survived the war.  I 
am the only one that survived.
 
 
You™re the only survivor of the Urbach--?
 
 
Of the Urbach or any Boldinger family from that area.
 
When did you realize that the Oskar Sc
hindler episode would become  fa mous?
 
 
After my settling in Krakow, the situation became 
clearer to me that no one survived.  It al so 
became clear to me  that Poland was no place to re
ma in.  Number one because of my previous 
knowledge of anti-Semitism, numbe r  two, the Russi
ans were there now and we already began to 
understand the Russians were not only the liberators 
but they also have a 
totalitarian state and 
certainly Poland was no place to rema in.  I bega n to
 look towa rds traveling out of Poland into the 
American or English zone, to some how get away
 from communism.  For a while, I traveled to 
Usti nad Orlici (Czech Republic) c.715) or the German na me  for it would have been Aussig (c. 

716) and hoped to settle in Czechoslovakia because
 I was ...  When the war ended and from my 
experience and knowledge of the Czechoslovakian pe
ople, they were the friendliest pe ople I ha ve 
ever come  across.  My own thinking led me  
to believe that ma ybe, some how settling in 
Czechoslovakia would be  the place and the three 
of us ma de that decision to some how escape 
from Poland and travel to Czechoslovakia and settle in the city of Austic (c. 724).  I don™t 

reme mber at this mo me nt how we happen to pick 
Austic but that™s where 
we were heading for.  
But when we got to Austic and we already had so
me  living quarters there, we were not in touch 
with any Jewish organizations th
at would provide us with more 
definite instructions or more 
definite help as to where and what.  We we
re some how on our own and we began to recognize 
that the Russians or the communists are there too 
and this was no place to stay.  So we began to 
look, the three of us began to look to escaping fro
m Czechoslovakia into the American or English 
zone.  That™s what we eventually did.  But be
fore we escaped from Czechoslovakia, we also 
discovered we acquired, all of a sudden, a skill 
of being able to cross the Polish Czechoslovak 
border fairly efficiently without 
being caught by the Russians or Po
les or Czechoslovaks.  So for 

a while, I acted as a courier in tr
ying to help some  people that wa
nted to get out of Poland. I was 
able to smuggle at least two pe
ople out of Krakow to Czechoslovakia and eventually into We st 
Germany. I helped smuggle them out of Poland into
 Czechoslovakia to help them get into the 
American zone and eventually wound 
up settling in Bomberg, Germany.  
 
 
Oskar Schindler reentered into my knowledge that he
, in fact, survived and 
he lived in Munich.  I 
went to see him in Munich.  He somehow had 
the knowledge to recogniz
e me and he called me 
by the name  of Ruma k ( ph) (c. 751).  Ruma k so
me how was give to me
Šthe name  Ruma k was 
given to me  some how in the process of the war because at one time I was called Schome k (c. 
754) but that became an awkward name  so some body popped out Ruma k.  The name Ruma k 
stuck and evidently Schindler re me mbered that na
me so he still reme mbered Rumak.  Later on in 

years, I became aware of it that Schindler was, 
in fact, a recognized Christian for helping Jews 
and it became common knowledge th
at he was a guest of the Is
raeli government and that he 
frequently traveled to Israel where he was cel
ebrated as a hero by the former inmates of the 
concentration camps, especially those that he helped
 survive.  One of those trips, my trips that  I 
went to Israel in 1973, I was awar
e that Schindler was in the count
ry at that time  and found the 
address of Oskar Schindler.  I, together with my 
family at that time, my wife, my children went to 
visit Oskar Schindler in Tel Aviv. 
 When I walked in, he was alr
eady a ma n a fter a slight stroke 
but he did recognize me .  He yelled out Ruma k.  
He called my name  again, he still reme mbered 

my na me  at that time.  We spoke briefly and we 
parted.  He eventually died the same  year and 
was buried on Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem.
 
 
He didn™t know your last name  then?  
 So the mystery of the list _____?
 
 
The mystery of the list continues, right.  Ther
e was only as I speculate
d already that was one 
chance that some Ger man official in the Krakow
 Plaszow ghetto was handed a list of who is 
going to Schindler.  It 
is unbeknown to me  but there is a good
 chance that there are some  people 
who would have known how this list was created.
  It certainly was not born in Gross-Rosen. 
 
 
As you know, there has been literature grown regard
ing his factory and his lists.  I™m s ure you™re 
fa miliar with some  of them.  What can you tell us regarding how the system really operated and 
how were people saved by Schindler?
 
 
Schindler managed to befriend the head of th
e SS guards of Krakow Plaszow, Amon Goeth. He 
some how managed to befriend him, 
and from what it appeared at
 that time, and was confirme d 
later on, this brutal murderer, 
Amon Goeth looked to Schindler a
nd believed that Schindler was a 
capable individual and that he 
would somehow help him accumulate
 wealth and well-being.  So 
some how an extreme friendship developed with those 
two people.  There is also the slight chance 

that Schi ndler was able to hand a list later on 
also.  I have no knowledge of this because some  
place along the line at that particul ar time of conf
usion when we were being transferred from one 
camp to another Oskar Schindler as well as Amon
 Goethe wound up in German jail.  This was 
not the first time that they wound up in German 
jail or Oskar Schindler would up in German jail 
and he wound up in German jail, as rumor woul d ha
ve it at that time , be cause German authorities 
became awa r e of his ability to 
accumulate wealth and having ware
houses of materials even back 
in Poland.  That some thing was fishy but Oska
r Schindler never stayed long enough in jail 
because some  of his cohorts and good friends from
 Berlin would set hi m free again and he went 
back to doing exactly what he was doing before, 
after he came out from jail.  I recall that Oskar 
Schindler just came out of jail not long beforewe came to Brunnlitz (Brnenec, Czech Republic). 

When we already were in Brunnlitz, this 
Amon Goeth who conducted all these hangings and 
shootings and murderous acts in 
Krakow Plaszow also appeared in Brunnlitz.  At one time , I 

reme mber seeing him but this Amon Goeth was no longer the Amon Goe t h of the SS guard with 

the almi ghty power but so me how they stripped him of all his ranks while he  was in jail.  Because 

he was in jail at that time, as 
rumor would have it, for stealing th
e transports of foods that would 
arrive into the concentration camp from some  
Jewish organizations abroad or Red Cross or 
some thing.  That he was stealing those and he wa
s turning them into gold 
and diamonds and other 
things.  So when he appeared in Brunnlitz, he 
looked like a former inma te.  The clothes that he 
once wore and looked so tall and big and fat, was 
not the same  ma n any more.  He looked like he 
went through hell in the German jail.  This Am
on Goeth eventually traveled back to Poland 
because evidently that™s where he was assigne
d.  He came to Brunnlitz only because of his 
friendship with Oskar Schindler so he evidently ca
me to visit Oskar Schindler but it also appears 

that Oskar Sc hindler didn™t return the friends
hip and did not help him stay with him in 
Czechoslovakia.  But from what I discovered 
later on, Amon Goeth retu
rned to Poland, to 
Krakow.  In fact, when the Russians ma rched i
n, Amon Goet h was captured by the Poles in that 
city of Krakow where he conducted this horribl
y brutal camp and eventually was sentenced to 
death by hanging.  He was hung in Krakow by the Po
lish authorities.  Oska
r Schindler also had 
great influence from what I have observed.  While the criminal acts of Amon Goeth were going 

on inside the camp, hangings, lync
hings, shootings, beatings, the whole catastrophe; it was also 
known to us at that time  that if
 Oskar Schindler entered the Kr a
kow Plaszow ca mp on a visit to 
Amon Goet h, Amon Goeth would suspend all the activ
ities of hangings and killings because he 
some ti me s didn™t want Schindler to know that he
 is conducting such affairs.  So in that way, 
ma ny of the Jews that were spared from hangings 
and killings and beatings were simply spared 

by Oskar Schindler appeari
ng in this killing camp.
 
 
How did people get on list?   I imagine that over 
a period of time , it was obviously that it was not 
a bad place to be, working for Mr. Schindler.  I su
spect that there were people who were tryi ng to 
get put on these lists.  Did you ha
ve any insight or knowledge about
 this, either during the time  
you were there or after the fact, after the war?
 
 

Yes, as I stated before probably towards the e
nd of the war, it became fairly obvious that if 
anyone will survive this nightmare
, it would be through the help 
some how of this character, 
Oskar S.  That being with him, he would some ho
w protect us.  Whether we knew it fully or not, I 
personally can™t say that I knew it but instinct would 
lead me to believe me all the time that that 
was a better place than any place else .  In Krak
ow Plaszow, when we returned to Krakow 
Plaszow because Oskar Schindle
r™s camp was closed, it became
 common knowledge that Oskar 
Schindler is still searching for a place, someplace that
 he would be able to 
move his people to that 
place, maybe further away from the front.  It 
some became common knowledge.  Also at this 
particular time, being maybe one of the younger me
mbers of the inma tes, being one of the lesser 
known inma tes, I did not personally 
know that.  But it was fairly obvi
ous that some  of the Jewish 
leaders in connection with some  of the Germans,
 the SS guards were aware of this in Krakow 
Plaszow, that Oskar Schindler is
 out there some place deeper into the country of Czechoslovakia 
ma ybe or Germany, escaping further away from th
e Russians.  And that 
he would create again a 
concentration camp and it would be desirable for 
anyone from the Krakow Plaszow camp to get 
to Oskar Schindler.  Some how, some of the Jewish
 authorities knew all that
 and some  of theŠin 
the process some of the former inmates or work
ers for Oskar Schindler would be shipped out to 

Mauthausen and ...  So as I explained before but
 to clarify, it would appear that the 1,000 people 
that survived in Oskar Sc hindler™s camp in 
Brunnlitz (Brnenec, Czech Republic), which was 
composed of 700 me n a nd 300 women approxima tel
y, were no longer the sa
me 1000 people that 
were at one time in the Krakow concentration camp
 near Os kar Schindler™s factory but, in fact, 
were those that were repl aced in the process of 
shipme nts leaving Krakow Plaszow into uncertain 
destinies and camps like Mauthausen.  Those former  workers of that factory were shipped out to 

those camps and replaced by other people from
 the Krakow Plaszow camp.  Those people 
essentially spent withŠin Brimlitz the last  six months of the war and survived that  way.
 
So you would say that some  people were bumped from
 the original list and that other name s were 
added?
 
 
It would appear at this point that some  people 
that were originally destined to go into Oskar 
Schindler™s camp were bumped in
 the process at Krakow Plaszo
w and were replaced by others.
 
 
Now Mr. Schindler, apparently he made a lot ofmoney during these years. 
 On the other hand, he 
saved people, he saved lives.  In your opini
on, based on your knowledge of the ma n, which was 
the more important for him?
 
 
It would appear to me  that Oskar Schindler of
 the earlier days of the war was an opportunist 
looking upon the war as a great opport
unity to enrich himself.  Cert
ainly being given that Jewish 

factory in Poland led him to believe that the future
 is his and that he was going to ma ke a lot of 
money.  But some place along the line, he began to feel that his ideas of making mone y, being an 

industrialist in Poland and accumulating wealth were not exactly what the German Reich would 
eventually lead into.  That is th
at the Jews would eventually be ki
lled and he would have to either 

stand on the side of Germans or else he would 
have problems.  So he probably some  place along 
that line began to fi gure out things that unless he appears as an extremely loyal German, he will 
not be able to conduct his business and he will notbe able to save anyone.  There is no doubt in 

my mi nd that he began to look upon the potential 
of ending the war and unless he had friends on 
both sides, he wasn™t going to ma ke it.  The rest 
of the war, he spent appearing extremely loyal to 

the Germans and at the same ti me appearing as 
Šacting as a friend of the Jews and inma tes of 
the concentration camp.
 
 
Now, your story, we left you in Bomber
g in 1945. How did you get to America?
 
 
I arrived in Bomberg, Germany on 
March 13, which happens to coincide with the date of the 
liquidation of the Krakow ghetto in 1943.  
I arrived in Bomberg in March 13, 1949 [? ].
 
 
In Bomberg?
 
 
In Bomberg.  Where I settled and began to cont
inue my educa tion whic
h I interrupted in 1939.  
The way I have done that is by private tutori
ng from a Ger man professor of a university who 
undertook to meet with me  and con
tinue my education.  This con
tinued education eventually led 

me  to apply to an engineering school in Neurenberg
 where I was eventually 
rejected as not either 
being well-prepared enough or not ha ving enough 
room to accommodate everyone.  I also at the 
same ti me had to support myself and I began 
work at the UNRRA, for UNRRA in warehouses 
where we were distributing food to other DPs.  
In 1946, Ada Birnbaum with her fami l y of Edith, 
Fred, Ann Birnbaum and Joe Birnbaum arrived in
 Bomberg, Germany.  At that time, I met Ada 
and her fami ly and we established a fr iendship, 
a courtship.  I established the friendship and 
courtship with Ada Birnbaum.  I continued 
my education and working for the UNRRA in 
German and I also began working in a radio-phon
ograph repair shop where 
I learned the trade of 
repairing small appliances.  All through this ti
me, I kept company with Ada Birnbaum.  In 1949, I 
left Germany for the United States.  I traveled 
by a for mer troop transport ship, United States 
Jumper, arrived in United States in 1949.  Ada 
Birnbaum and her family arrived in the United 
States about three months later 
in June of 1949.  In 1950, we were ma rried in New York and lived 
until 1951 in New York City.  I cont inued working in woodworking shops and furniture shops 

and Ada began work as a seamstress in the garment center in New York.  Eventually in 1951, 
Ada™s parents bought a fa rm in Fle mington, New Je
rsey where they moved to.  Since our roots 

were not very deep in New York, ma king a living
 was difficult, in fact.  Both Ada and myself 
decided to move to Flemington, Ne
w Jersey where her parents were already settled at a chicken 
far m.  I began work as a carpent er in th
e Flemington area.  I became a union me mber, a 
carpent ers™ union me mb er and was ab
le, in fact, to make a decent 
living in Flemington.  Our first 
child was born in 1952, that is David; our secondchild was born in 1955, that is Barbara, and the 

third child wa s born, also in Flemington in 1963 a
nd that is Henry.  I continued my work as a 

carpenter for a while.  In 1953, I 
established a construction busine
ss which began operating as the 
firm of Ree mer (? ) and Urbach.  That busin
essŠthat partne rship last ed until 1959.  From 1959 
on, I began operating the business, the same  buildi
ng construction business as Urbach and Urbach 
in Flemington.  My oldest son is ma rried to 
Zeborak Kohane (c. 040) 
and they have three 
children, Rebecca, Simon, Jonathan.  They now 
reside in Cape Cod, ______ (c. 045)  Cape Cod 
where David is a cardiologist at 
the hospital and has a private pract
ice of a group of five.  Barbara 
is married to Michael Listner (
ph. c. 046) now residing in Cresce
nt, New Jersey.  Barbara is an 
attorney, graduated from __________ (c. 048) Universi
ty and her husband is also an attorney.  
They have two children, one is Samuel and the da
ughter is Elise.  They 
both practice law in New 
Jersey and New York.  The youngest one, Henry, is
 single.  He is a graduate of Princeton 
University, went on to Columbia
 Law School where he finished a successful first year of law 
school.  Decided that he did not 
like law, transferred into arch
itecture, graduated with honors 
from the School of Architecture in Columbia and 
at present, in 1992, is entering a Ph.D. program 
in architectur e at Princeton University.
 
 
Sounds like congratulations are in order.  I ce
rtainly can add that you are a very young-looking 

grandfather.
 
 
Thank you very much.  It was a little bit of a 
trip again, to do that, 
but it had to be done.
 
 
I thank you on behalf of the Museum for your time and for your story.
