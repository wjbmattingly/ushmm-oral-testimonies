The date is Monday, Marc
h 2 and we're talking with
 Mr. Henry Lubell of Pe
ekskill, New York.  Mr . 
Lubell  c oul d you plea se  tell us  a  
lit tl e bit  about yours el f, your  na me
 during the war,
 your  date  of 
birth, your pl ace of birt h.
 
 
Yea h, I  was  bor n 1911 in Do
mbrova Gornicza.  
This is by the Ge
rman border in Po
land and then in 
1916, thi s was duri ng t h e first  Wo r l d War  my parent s move d out t o
 Ger ma ny .  Ac
tually it was  
Poland and my  father 
ha d t here  a job as haza n and shoc het( mo hel).
 
 
In what town?
 
 
The town, fi rst it was a little town
 Rawicz and later on in Katowice
.  We  were six children, fou r  
brot hers  and two sister s.  Somehow or ot her ever y
body got  a n education. It
 was no pr oble m.  M y 
olde st brot he r was  a  de nti st.  Th
e s econd br other was a  phar ma cist. 
 I we nt to bus ine ss  s chool an d 
my youngest  br othe r al so 
and we, I can't say well o
ff, but  better  busi nes s clas s.
 
 
Ho w was  y o ur ho me , Je wis hly?
 
 
Je wish we onl y lear ne d what we
 were taught at home by my 
father  bec aus e 
it was a small 
congre gati on, t here  was  no J ewish le s sons t here .  
We  had ma ybe history, Je
wi sh his t or y a nd s o on 
but othe rwis e we were only ta ught by our fat her
, all bar mitz vah and eve r
ythi ng my father t aught 
the sa me  as  he t aught  ot her c hildr en.
 
 
We re you observa nt  at home?
 
 
Not too much.  My fa ther, yes.  My mother  wa s 
not  s o religi ous .  Al so 
naturally it was a koshe r  
home but we  wer e not t o o reli giou
s.  Also my  pa rents 
knew a bout it a nd t hey 
didn't fo rce us.  They 
kne w how it  is a nd e verybody fini she d s chool , high 
s chool  or  business  sc hool a nd e ver ybody ha d t o  
go out  from home  on a  j
ob.  Thi s we nt on nice  a nd quiet . 
 We li ved i n  Poland;
 this town became 
Polish again, but 
we didn't feel 
any anti-semitism.
 

 
You didn't.
 
 
No, no.  I had friends, gen
tile, Polish and even 
after the war I was in touch 
with him and 
he did a lot 
of favor s what I need
ed, some documents 
from Poland and s o on.
  Act ually one  of my brothe rs, he  
was a lieutenant in the Polis
h ar my, t h e phar ma cist .  He enj oye d it
.  Espe cia lly i n 
Po land, an officer 
in the army, a lieute
nant and he had the 
sci ence of the medical  corps a
nd everybody was in awe.  He  
liked to put on his uniform.  Till the war starte
d out ...we  live d in Kat o wi
ce when the war  started 
right  ne xt  to the Ger man bor der.
 
 
What  were  you doin
g at  t hat ti me?
 
 
At that time I was 
in business and we were as 
I said pretty well off and 
we  wa nted t o prot ect  our  
pare nts so we se nt my mother  and 
t w o sist ers t o Kielce, thi s is a 
town  maybe from the border ma ybe  
150 miles  or  so, a wee k before t h
e war started.  When t he war starte
d we had there t his apart ment i n 
Kat o wice and the next day alr eady 
t he Ger mans all over.  They came
 out fr om the 
holes with the  
swastika. Of course in th
i s part  of Pol and you coul dn't know 
who is a Pola
ck and who is a German. 
The y c oul d be whatever they want
ed.  What ever was mor e convenien
t, this they to
ok.  Ev erybody 
spoke both languages 
in this part.  And then 
we left  with a little car, 
a little VW.  Seven persons  
pus he d i nto t his car  and we  went wit h i nterr upti o ns
 and we  came to this town to Kiel ce.  This was 
Friday ni nth the first da y of the war.  But the ne
xt  day ther e came alr ea
dy rumors the Germans are 
approaching this town.  We  were 
there on  the pl aza in 
this town.  It was ma
ybe  a fter  mi dni ght .  My 
friend put on the radio.  It happen
ed so that he had there a Ger man
 st ation.  There came  already t he 
mob around us that they called a spy because they he
ard us listening to the 
German radio.  So the 
police came and t hey t ook 
away t his friend of ours 
with this car and he became  the chauffeur of the 
polic e de par t me nt.  Ever ybody s aid t he me n s hou
ld go away because no
body could imagine that  
they will punish or kill the women 
and children.  I had a 
little suitcase that I put 
in all my necessities 
and my father just grabbed his tallis and tvillin and we 
went out going 
east. Hundreds 
of thousands 
of pe ople wa lked away fr om the German border and ev
erybody wanted to go as 
far  east as possibl e. 
We  were wa lking and then we  fo
und a Jewish peasant  wh
o was going in the op
posite direction so 
we  tol d hi m, (he  ha d a  horse  and b
uggy) I sa id t o  come  
with us.  We  were ta
king all the expenses 
and we will go with this horse and 
buggy.  And that's the 
way it was.  We went
 all the way to the  
Russian border.  Somehow 
it was defeating.  We we
nt there through these l
ittle towns in Poland and  
you had the fe eling that it's the Je w, he got to he lp
 us some how.  An d it was 
al so.  We came t o t he 
little towns, the girls came out, they
 were washing our sock
s and shirts and we 
stayed overnight in 
di fferent Jewish places.  Everybody 
accept ed this as a nor mal t hing.  
Then we were in t he last t o wn 
*Rajibiroff[ph109].  This wa
s a prosperous little Jewish
 town.  We  came there 
in t he market place.  
Thi s was Rosh Hashonah.  Ther e ca
me out  a Ra bbi.  We  were eight  
or ten people in this horse and 
buggy.  So  he divided us.  
He took my  father to hi
s  hous e.  Ther e were  s o me  tea cher s.  He gave  hi m 
there  s o me  other...They wer e not a f
r aid beca use  t hey didn't  know t hat
 t he  front  wa s  moving so fast.  

The  se cond day of Ros h Ha shona h we 
want ed t o l eave so the Rabbi  sa
i d you are already on t he r un,  
never mi nd you ca n go.  We will  
stay here and see what 's  going t o
 ha ppe n.  So we  went a not her  
ma ybe 20, 30 mile s a nd we got  to 
the  Russi an bor der.  It wa s a  s ma
ll t o wn, *La noftsa [ph122].  Thi s  
little town was maybe 10
0% Jewish.  Also the popu
lation took care of 
us...in line for 
fruit or bread. 
And they said not to wo
rry, t he  Rus sians  woul d co
me  over here.  We  didn'
t  belie ve  it .  Nobody  
believed that the Russi
ans and the Ger man
s ma de a pac t  to divide Pol a
nd.  It ha ppe ne d so t hat t h e  
Russian army came to Pola
nd.  No Russian soldier 
came to this little town 
there.  They went an d 
circle d it  a n d we nt  they
 further and we st ayed 
there and agai n t he *Byezh
enski[ph134] they calle d 
us.  It came Yom Kippur  and we  we nt to the shool. 
 The whol e town was t h ere.
  I come there in the 
shool, and in the  hal l out
side  I see there a ma n sit
ting there with a gu
n so I asked what is this.  He 
says this is the only 
militia man we have.  
He is Jewish.  
He wanted to go to 
Kol Nidre and the other 
one  is  a  grea t la nd owner  he re  in
 this section and he had to watc
h hi m a nd not  to 
lose him he took 
hi m i n  the s hool also.  
Then the Russians came an
d  we  we nt t o  the  big ger
 cit y t her e i n east ern  
Poland, Lvov or Lemberg. 
 The city wa s so filled up with popu
lation.  It had be
fore t h e war some 
300,000 population and now 
with the refugees the to
wn had over a million po
pulation.  ..had to go 
bac k t o bri n g some  cl othing a nd 
maybe some val uabl es a
nd I we nt bac k  to Ge
rmany, to the German 
part of Pola nd.  I went  t here wi
t h a Ukraini an shiksa who wa s in 
l ove wit h me a nd another Je wis h  
girl a nd we  we nt bac k t o  Pola nd
.  But this is 
all  complicat ed.
 
 
Are there any maj or thi n gs t hat  ha
ppe ned at  thi s ti me , epis odes  
or  inci de nts  that you r e me mber?
 
 
The Russian soldiers, wherever they were, when some body wanted to come this wa y, the Russi ans 
said go bac k .  So we wer e  by t he bor der a nd t he Ru
ssia ns stoppe d us.  This 
was alr eady on the way  

bac k.  So we  tol d  hi m we  want  t o go t o t he  Ger m
a n side  but  we c ha nge d our mi nds, we  want  t o go  
bac k.  He  sai d so go bac k .  So 
we  crossed the border 
wit hout  being bot her e d by the  Rus sians .  Thi s  
is luck.  And then pe
ople didn't know what 
chances to take.  It
 wa s onl y to t ake  a  
chance.  I  survi ved 
because I didn't have
 any illusions.  As  soon as
 we were in the wa gon I pr
epared for my self.  I took 
a carton of cigarettes, a loaf of
 br ead and a blade, a sawing blad
e I  put  i n my shoes  bet wee n the  
soles.  We  knew what's
 going on but t he pe ople  
di dn't wa nt t o know it .
 
 
You kne w a bout t he ca mps?
 
 
We  kne w a b out t he ca mps ma ybe no
t so cl ose about it but we knew
.  When I j u mped the t r ain I  
kne w that I  wa s ta king a 
chance with maybe t wo or
 thr ee weeks of li fe.
 
 
Do you wa nt  to tell  us  a b out  
the time when you ju
mped the tr ai n or wa
s that  much later?
 
 

No this is later.  I can tell 
you ma ybe  ski p t he  ghetto, how t h
e ghett o wor ke d a nd how it was 
arranged.
 
 
That  would be i nter esting. 
 What  di d you do ther e ?
 
 
Wh en they started with the ghetto and they needed
 pe opl e  to work for  the m. 
 But  nobody want ed t o  
go t o work.  So t hey we nt
 out, the Germans, and th
ey ca ught people on th
e street, wherever t h ey 
found t he m and t he y s ent the m t o t he railroa d st ati
on.  Ther e the job was t o 
widen t he rai lroad tracks  
because the Ru ssians ha ve  a different wi dth of the 
railroad tracks.  It was 
very har d  work.  There  
wa s a man, his name  wa s Horowitz, 
and he  was  t he  he ad of t he  congr
egat ion.  That  was a famous 
fa mi ly.  The y ha d a  talli s  factory 
i n Kolomj ya.  He  ca me out  and he
 ha d a  bi g s peec h for vol unte ers  
to go to the railroad station so 
the Germans pr omised hi m they woul
dn't c at ch nobody on t he street . 
So I vol unt e ered.  I wa s a str ong y
oung man.  I spoke  fluent  Ger man.
 
 
Wh ere were you wh en you
 vol unte ere d for t his?
 
 
In t he  ghett o .  We  we nt  only to 
Ger man sc hools .  So at
 home  we  spoke Ge rman 
and this helped a lot 
ma yb e to o.   An yh o w we  wer e  th er
e a nd ever ybody looked 
to have a bunk
er  in t he house where they 
lived.  So we ha d t he a t t i c, li ke t h
is was the wall fr om th
e att ic, so we bui lt up
 a second wall .  We 
had a  foot, ma ybe t w o feet spa ce  
between the two walls 
and i f  s o me body ca me
 up the stair s an d 
looked left  and right and he saw ju
st the wall so he didn'
t  expect t hat  there are 
double walls.  So the 
next day I volunt
eered and the son of a bitche
s they hit us the 
same as before.  Also I was a little  
experienced wit h it .  But anyhow 
I  we nt home  a nd I sai d no more 
voluntee ring.  La
ter on it was the  
ghetto a little organized
 and there came a lot of
 Hungarian Jews, a mong th
em my wife 
and parents 
too and they had there a so
up kitchen and they made me
 in c h arge  of order  in 
the soup kitchen.  It 
wa s not an e asy c har ge .  The y ga
ve out maybe some five or si x th
ous and portions a nd t o ke ep orde r  
a mong a fe w thous and hungr y people 
is not an easy job.  But anyh
ow they had nobody else and 
they made me the head of
 t he kitc hen.  Ther e a mong ot her s  my
 wi fe came there 
for  soup, t oo.  I  
always treated her good.  It was so
 there were these Hungarian Jews and I didn't come in one day to 
wo rk and everybody was asking fo
r  me  beca use  they kne
w when I was there ev
er ybody had t o be  
disci plined and t hat 's all  we n
eeded bec aus e t he  soup the y got fi
ve minutes earli er or lat er but  
ever ybody wa s hungry.   And it  ha ppe ne d s o la ter 
on when I escaped f rom 
this ghetto I was in 
Hungary and there some 
Je ws  were  esca pi ng fr o m Kol o mj y a  
too a nd they hear d a b out my na me  
and they asked me 
i f I wa s there  in the  soup kit che n.
 
 
Do you wa nt  to tell  us  a b out  y
our  es c ape?   How did you e sca pe?
 
 

In thi s ghett o there came ever y fe
w weeks, t here came an acti o n they 
called it.  They 
took thousands  
and t hous ands of pe ople.  Firs t they s egre gate d.  
I  was there on the plaza a
nd I was t he  hea d of the  
kitchen ther e  wit h my per sonnel  an
d I  talke d t o t his  Ger ma n a nd he  ga ve me  hal f t he  e mploye es and 
me .  After this went  by, they to
ok away this one day qu
ite a fe w thousa nd people
.  But they always 
did the same thing. 
 Whe n t he da y we nt by, whoe ver s urvi ve d 
t hey ma de be lieve  that t hi s would be  
already t he end of it, t hat  they w
oul dn't ta ke any more people .  But 
I didn't trust t hem.  I forgot t o  
tell you something else, let's skip it.
 
 
Do you wa nt  to go bac k a nd tell me, it 's oka y.
 
 
The first action what there was, th
ere were German and Hungarian so
ldiers.  I had a little store there 
in the ghetto with sweets
, bakery and so on.  I we
nt t o work on a  Sunda y mo
rni ng.  I go
 out and I  
see t he  stre et  is e mpt y.  I  kept  
going a nd I s ee t her e 's  
a Ger man SS standi ng 
and he stopped me and 
asked me where I ' m go
i ng s o  I  told hi m I  a m goi ng t o open up 
the stor e.  So he 
l ooks at me and he 
says  you s ee  over  ther e on t he  ro
ad there i s standi ng maybe some
 two three hundred people, Jews 
and they we re s urrounde d 
by  SS me n and German shepherds and 
he says go ther
e and join thes e 
people .  I  wa s we aring a t r
ench coat  and here 
on t h e left ar m I 
had the Jewish star
 and I wa s wa lking 
here .  I  di dn't go on t he  r oad, I st
ayed on the sidewalk.  
My coat  opened 
up and covered 
here  t he  st ar  
and as I approached this
 group they started walk
ing towards me . I stayed
 on the sidewalk and I 
walked by.  There was a gr
oup of Polacks standing th
er e and t hey said i n  Po
lish, for heaven's  sake 
you'd bett er go home  bec ause  t he y 
wi ll grab you too and yo
u will never come  ba
ck.  I we nt around 
there a few blocks and I we
nt back home a nd t his  wa
s the first action they t
ook.  I c o me  home and I  
told it to my  father so 
he says in honor of your 
gr andfathe r they di dn't  ta ke
 you.  Out  of this  group  
none came back.  Among others there 
wa s the sister or the wi fe of 
the *Judenratt[p h
303] this Mrs. 
Ho rowitz and everybody wa s asking 
go and try t o  get  the pe opl e out . 
 He was coll aborat ing as good 
as he c oul d a nd he  di dn't i nterven
e for his wi fe.  He as
ked to int ervene for t h
e wh ole group and they 
didn't want  t o gi ve it t o hi m.   
So this Mr. Horowitz la
ter on when he realized 
that this was a lost 
case commi t ted suicide.  Thi s wa
s t he  Mr.  Hor o wi tz in  Kol o mj ya.
 
 
Do  you know what
 year this is?
 
 
This wa s in 1940, 41.  Th
is was the fall of 1941.
 
 
Do you wa nt  to move 
on to your escape from this
 ghetto.  Yo u did 
go to ot he r pla ces .  Is  t hat ri ght?
 
 
I st ayed in this ghetto till th
e last  act ion was t her e and t he Ge
r mans surr ounde d the  whole  ghett o. 
The y ca me a t  night bet we en t hree  and four  o'clock 
and they took ev
erybody out of the beds and put  

them all  on this pl aza.  My fat her
 wasn 't  there anymore.  He  was 
t ake n a wa y  the  a cti on pr evi ous. 
The y  kept  us  t here  on t his  plaza  t h
e  whole  da y.  Only i n  the  a ft ernoo
n we went out.  
I was there wi th 
four  ot her  fr iends a nd e verybody ha d s o me  ki nd of
 ins t rume nt hidden on 
him.  We  didn't know 
where they will take us b
ecause they took people so
metimes in the village be
hind this town and they 
prepared ditches and t hey 
took the people ther
e  a nd s hot  t he m t h ere  in t he  dit ches  or  they coul d ta ke  
us t o t he r ail road stati on.  So
 we ma de  up, e ver ybody was voti n g 
for me , I wa s al wa ys  t he guy who 
got t he vot es , s o I t old the gr oup - 
I said we go to the railroad statio
n, the n we ha ve a better c ha nc e  
to jump out of the window 
or something.  If they ta
ke us there to this little v
illage then we will know 
that we  don't have mu ch 
of a chance. So we went  
to the railroad station, 
eight abr east ,
 and we  go on 
the road, so we  knew that we 're go
ing to the railroad stat
ion.  Here next to 
me  was  a  w o man  wit h  a  
little baby in the arm and as we wa
lk along she takes the 
baby and pushes it on
 the Polish wo man's  
ar m.  She  di dn't  know 
the woman, she didn't know her name .  
She just  took a chance.  She knew 
that this  c hi l d has  mor e  of a  chanc e ma ybe  t o su
rvive.  This is what 
I  say when i t comes to  
disc ussi ons about t he holoc aust  a n
d so on about the bo
oks that  came out i n
 the tens and the 
hundre ds , who can de scr i be t he f
eeli n g of thi s woma n who ga ve a w
ay her  baby.  Who can des cribe  
this?    So anyhow we we nt
 to the railroad station 
and we were maybe in th
e middle of this whole  
mar ch.  I see that t hey're starting 
by the end of the train and they're 
chasing in there some seventy or  
a hundr ed pe ople .   The n t hey go 
to the second train a
nd they're hocking and 
beati ng ever ybody and 
then I saw one of these cattle wag
ons had their window taken out an
d repaired.  So I said to my 
group we stoppe d and we  let  the  fr
ont  go further and we went  here 
and we nt t o t his  wa gon here , t o  
this wagon I picked out
.  We  went in there.  Nobo
dy was hitting us 
and we were safe 
in this wagon. 
It happened so that  I  was standi ng
 t here and I  had the feeli ng t hat I '
m just a  ne utral  obs e r ver.  When 
I hea rd t he peopl e tal king I ha d t he fe eling tha t it 
doe sn't c onc ern me  a nd t h
e episode with the water 
did you put it in here before?
 
 
No .
 
 
The r e  was  i n t his  wa gon some  seve nty or  a hund
red people and there was 
no place to sit down. 
Onl y part of the people c oul d s
it down.  Then s o me body l ooks out 
t he wi ndow and it wa s ver y hot .  
The sun was shining on th
e roof.  It was only Oc
tober.  Then somebody 
hollers they'r e putting i n  
bread and water in the wago
ns.  So I said to my fr
iends.  You will see nobody
 will drink the water .  
They sai d what are you crazy.  An
d I  said no, I, m not  cr
azy but I know what's 
going t o happen.  And 
sure  enough a fter  a fe w mi nutes 
they're pushing in tw
o l oaves of br ead an
d a pail of water and 
ever ybody goes  a nd tri es  to gra b  a  
pi e ce of br ea d or a  s ip 
of water and they turned over  the pail.  So 
I told my fri ends, you se
e, this is what I know 
wi ll ha ppe n.  And we were st
anding so in the corner 
the whol e day and it  got dar k  the  
tr ain starte d movi ng.  I t alke d t o
 my  wi fe 's pare nts be fore  we 
be for e  we  went i nto the  wa
gon.  The n I said we have a c ha nce  
to get out  when we 
will take out the 
piece of wood there on this wi ndow
.  Thi s wa s eas y t o t ake  out .  Ev
er ybody ha d a scre w dri ver  or  a  
hammer or something.  A
nd I said we will jump ou
t.  There I saw a lot 
of people who ju mped. 
Everybody who jump ed fr om
 the  tr ai n ha d her e a scrape  of t he  
face like this because this move ment  
of t he tr ain i t went  for w ards  and you had to 
jump backwar ds bec aus e you
 get t he pus h fr om t h e  

movement.  I wa
s jumping the third.  The firs
t one I said you will be the 
first one jumping out you'll  
go in the direction of th
e trai n and t h e second also and t he t hi r
d stays on t he plac
e and the rest of 
them goes back and we w
ill meet here.  But 
it happened so that 
I met only one of my
 friends.  This  
wa s a young ma n by the name
 of Ha mmer .  His  pare nts  had a pa per  fac t ory i n  the  vi llage  next  to 
this Kolomjya.  This Ha
mmer  t he Ger mans made hi m t he manage
r of this paper 
factory and every 
day i n  the morni ng he  went  out  w
ith a group of wo rkers from the gh
etto.  He went to work and at 
night he c a me ba ck.  So he sa ys we
 will go there to this
 vill age  and we 'l l  ma ke belie ve t h at we c a me  
out of the ghetto to work
.  We had t o st ay there 
the whol e da y a nd 
wait till they we
nt  bac k t o t he 
ghett o. He went to wor k and he put
 me t her e in a shack and he says
 I wi l l  bring you s o methi ng to 
eat.  Just stay ther e.  Sur e enough 
he brought me t o eat a nd at night 
we we nt ba ck t o the ghetto li ke  
fr om work.  And the  ot her gr oup 
came back.  And 
we we nt  to t he ghetto. 
 And here comes a Mr. 
Haas, he wa s the h
ead of t he ghetto.
 
 
A Je wis h he ad?
 
 
Yeah, yeah.  He says to me
, Henry I wa nt you to be 
the distributor of the brea
d. Aft er  each acti on or  
whatever i t was t he Ger mans want ed
 t o know how ma ny we re le ft  a n
d they sent so many portions  
of brea d i n.  So I s aid no I 'm not
 interested anymo re in 
nothing, only one thing 
I wa nt t o  get  out of 
here.  This time there was ma ybe a fe w hundred ma
ybe  le ss  than a  t hous and
 people there in the 
ghetto out of 25,000 or mo
re.  So  he says 
you can make a fort
une.  I say I know
 how to ma ke a 
fortune by t his brea d dis t ributi on but  I 'm not i nte rest
ed anymore.  So how is the gold mi ne there? 
Yo u got so and so ma ny pounds of
 bread.  I don't know, everybody
 got  a  pound or so, some thi ng 
like t his.  The one who sold t he br
ea d ha d a scal e - t wo pot s, on e ac h
 si de a pot a nd one side wer e  
the weights , on the  ot her  si
de  the brea d.  It  took a  
day to di stri bute a whole  br
ea d.  So he re where  the  
brea d was  were  cru mbs .  I never  
cleaned out the crumbs. 
 The crumbs were staying there the whole 
day and fr om e ver y port i on of brea
d the cr umbs may be a quarter of
 an ounc e or something a nd by 
the e nd of the da y everyt hing wa
s dis t ribut ed a nd you ha d one  brea
d, ma ybe t wo bre a ds le ft over .  
But I said not interest
ed anymore.  And there wa s a Po
lis h, a Ukraini an pea sant  ma ybe wh o 
delivered to the Ger mans, they ha
d a place wher e they col l ected meta
l, r ags , a nd so on where t he y 
coul d recycl e.  Thi s peasant came
 one day and says next week We
dnesday there came
 t he s muggl er  
to me a nd he ha s to ha ve ten pe ople  and he wi ll 
take you ove r  the bor der .
  This smuggler was the 
sa me t hat  Eli zabet h went  wit h.  I  di dn't know about  it.
 
 
Wa s he  a Hungari an?
 
 
No ,, no, this was Poland, 
Ukrainian.  He  come s.  There was a gi
rl  living with me  in the ghetto, a 
Hungaria n gi rl, not  t his  one.  They
 send the s muggler for 
her, to bring her  bac k
 to Hungary.  But the 
s muggler  wa nted to go on
ly with ten people becaus
e  ot her wis e it doesn't  pay 
so I told the guys and 
they said they w
on't go, they will hire and go 
with the truck not with the 
peasant there.  So I said 

oka y you ca n do what  you wa nt.  Wh
at do you t hi nk you ha ve suc h a  
good credit rati
ng?  The Polak 
will take you when 
he  gets  his  mone y i n  a dva nce .  Thi s  pe
asant came  and I spoke to hi m and I told 
hi m t hat  I  wi ll go onl y wi th
 this one girl and 
for  t h is one  gi rl t h ey ha d 
t he  mone y i n  Hungary.  The 
next day we  made arrangem
ents and thi s peasant  ca
me  there to this
 lot  where  they ha d t hese  ra gs  
and he said he will
 go through town and 
by the end of the town there's 
a  ri ver  and a  bri dge  a nd whe n 
they cr oss  t h e bri dge he  will  st op 
and take us on this bu
ggy.  So we  went  thro
ugh t o wn a nd this gi rl 
wa s very semitic Jewish looking a
nd whenever we we nt  by a store an
d it was dark an
d the store was 
light  I told her to wear  a hat an
d I took off my  band and some how 
I felt like I'm a 
free bird.  Why 
should I wear this?  So 
I took it off and the girl
 took it off and we went 
through the whole town till  
we caught up with this p
easa nt a nd he stopped a n d sai d, get up. 
 So we went on t his buggy a nd we 
laid fl at on the fl oor and covere
d ourselves and he drove
 off.  It took quite 
a fe w hours till we got 
where t he peasant  lived a
nd we arri ve d on hi s far m a nd the r e wa
s a big mountain of dried le ave s.  
He  buried us in these leaves and he
 sai d to sta y her e an
d he wil l  come back l ate
r.  Maybe after a half 
an hour , an hour, t he  pe as
ant comes and says let's go.  He took 
us in the stable.  
In t h e stabl e was 
hay upst airs  and he  sa ys  go up ther e  
and st ay t her e i n t he atti c.  Af
ter a long while 
he comes with a 
loaf of bread and a can of mil k
 an d we  we re  eatin g 
suppe r, so c alled.  An
d the peasant says 
tomorr ow morni ng he goes back ther
e and what shall he tell  t he peop
le?  So I told 
hi m you wa nt to 
do me a favor I wrote him down on a 
pi ece  of pa per in Ger m an t o  trus
t this man, that
 he i s a ver y  
dece nt guy and not  to t ake c ha nce s  wit h s o me t r uc
ks or  somet hing.  I t old
 the peasant to tell the 
s muggler  tha t  we will  ha
ve to go by ourselves be
cause they don't 
know him and they
 don't trust him 
to go.  The next day the peasant go
es into town and at night he co
mes bac k a nd he ope ns up t he tra p  
door a nd sti cks his  he ad in a nd sa ys  in Hungaria
n[690], in English - in 
Kolomj ya there's nothing 
left.  And it happened so th
at  I  had such a feeling t hat
 pulled me out of this ghe
tto, out of this town. 
The Germans surrounded 
the whole rest of the ghet
to what was there and they
 lit it up fr om all sides 
and hardly some
body could escape fr om it.
 
 
What  year was t his?
 
 
Thi s wa s 1943.
 
 
Where  di d you go a ft er t hat?
 
 
After that this peasant went with
 us.  We we nt to the s muggle r  
and I told him to tell the smuggler  
that  whe n we will  be  on t he other 
side, on the Hungarian side, he will
 have to bring a pi ece of pa per ,  
a lett er that  I  ga ve  hi m and other 
people will come 
the ne xt ti me.  They wa nt
 t o  ha ve  pr oof that w e  
are safe i n Hungary.  
Bes i de s me  and thi s gi rl was a not he
r Jewish wo ma n.  Sh e was hidi ng 
somewhere i n t he woods and the pe
a s ants  were  fe eding her  a n d t hen
  there come  another young boy 
and he  s ays  the  next  night  we  will
 go.  And the smuggler says don't 
wor ry.  I f t here  i s any da nger  
don't panic I will use the gun
.  So we went with th
e same smuggler and after 
a fe w days we're on the 

Hungaria n si de.  The  s muggler  ta ke
s the letter there from this girl  
to her relatives. 
 The smuggler 
goe s  a wa y  a nd t hat  ni ght  he  c o mes  
back and says nobody is
 t here at  this addr
ess .   The pe ople  r an 
awa y a nd he  doe sn't have  nowhere t o
 leave  us .  So I sai d 
what doe s thi s me an?   He sa ys  we  ha ve t o  
try whate ver  you ca n but  I woul d a d
vise you t o go t o s o me  ge ndar me s
 and gi ve yours e lf up.  Thi s  
was a sure deat h because
 the Hungarians when t hey caught  so
me body gave  over  to t he  Ger ma n  
gestapo.  Th ey were 
right by the border.  I ha
d some  Poli sh mone y so th
e smuggler  exchanged some 
Polish money for Hungarian.  This
 young boy who wa s wi th
 us said that  he's 
going back with the  
smuggler.  This boy 
was living in the village wh
ere he lived before
 the war and he 
stayed overnig h t 
ever y night somewhere el se. 
 He di dn't even tell t h e 
peasants that he's  there.
  Nobody knew, but  he  
slept  every night  somewhere el se.  
He we nt bac k.   So  I wa s l e ft  wi
th these two wome
n.  The peasant  
ca me.  He gave me  s o me ot her fe w pennies [ *Hunga
ri an731] he had, t his 
Hungaria n mone y a nd he  
left us there.  This was on a Fr
i day ni ght also.  The pe
asa nt we nt a wa y.  When it got da rk, I  go out  
fr om this bunker.  This
 wa s  built  up fr om pr ess e d ha y for  t h e 
wi nter  for  the  c o ws, and insi de  wa s 
hidi ng us .  It  wa s hollow.  He  goes a wa y a nd t hat 's 
all and he says lots of 
l uck.  We  sta r ted wal king 
towards the village.  It's  light in 
the house and I hear si
nging Zemiros and I thou
ght now we are safe .  
I go to t he door and knock on t h
e door a nd t he woman as
ks i n Hunga rian who i s it .  I  ans w ered i n  
Yiddish to open up the door we  
nee d help.  So this  woma n didn'
t open the door.  But she was 
holler i ng s o l oud [*
in Yiddish749].  She 
didn't  ope n t he door.
 
 
Could you tr anslat e for the tape?
 
 
Yes, go away from my 
door.  You're killing me.  
So we left  her and we'r e 
walking and we come t o  
anot her  hous e.  Ther e wa s a  light i n i t  but  it wa s 
not Je wi sh.  And I  sai d t o
 t h e wo ma n  wh o wa s wit h  
us, she was a typical aryan face yo
u go t here  (a nd s he s poke very go
od the language also) and ask 
about directi ons, where t he r ailroad 
station is and so on. 
 So  the wo ma n goes in. 
 She knoc ks  on t he  
door.  Some body opene d  th
e  door  and s he walks  in a nd I neve
r sa w thi s  wo ma n  ag ai n.  We  were  
sitting there maybe at least 
an hour and nobo
dy came out.  I di
dn't want to take 
any chances.  We  go 
there to this village and all of
 a sudden a horse and buggy guy 
comes by and he 
stops and says 
where do you want t o go
?  So I tol d hi m I want t o go t o the rail ro
ad stati on.  So he 
says go sit down. 
So we went there in this 
buggy and we went
 to this village.  
All of a sudden ther
e's a little bar there 
and this guy stops and walk
s  ins i de  t h e bar and sa ys  wait  her e I 'll be  ri ght  back. 
 We 're waiting and 
he didn't come  out eit he r.  Anot
her guy co mes out a nd he 's followi
ng us .  We starte d wa lki ng and 
he's followi ng us.  I said 
let's go in here.  Ther e's 
a dark yard there.  We  wa
lk in there and he follows 
us too i n there.  I stopped a nd I sai d to t his gi
r l , talk to hi m i n Hunga ri
an.  I di dn't speak the  
langua ge.  I said do some
thing, try, do 
something.  I started talking 
to the guy Poli
sh, whatever  I  
coul d, Hungarian I di dn't  
know much.  I took off my
 watc h a n d I had a li ghte
r and I said here t ake  
the watc h a nd t he li ght e r , what  els e can I give y
ou a nd let us go.  So he
 took the watch and the  
lighte r and he says oka y over t her e is  the rail ro
a d  station but wat ch out 
don't get  ca ught beca us e 
when you get ca ught he re you are  
l ost.  Thi s was ri ght  by t he bor de
r.  So we go 
to the railroad  
station and outside it wa
s  dark and i ns ide was  only a pal e light. 
 I go insi de and I  tell t he  girl not t o  
stand in t he  l ight .  There  i s a  li ne
 there and people are st
a ndi ng in l i ne  for  thes
e tickets.  There come  

two policemen, two gendarmes, tall 
guys, and they started talking to 
me  a n d I didn't wa nt t o a ns wer , 
just  move d my ha nd li ke 
t his , but  I  underst and, he  
want s  to go a hea d of me  
in the line.  So he was 
ahead of me  and I came  to 
t his  wi ndow i n plai n Poli
sh but in Ukrainian it's 
the same thing.  I said 
Two t o *Rachov[ph792].  Thi s 
was the next town.  In *Rac
hov t his girl ha d a ma ch 
tainiste[* ph799].
 
 
"In-law"
 
 
Yea h, i n *Rachov.  So s he sa ys  we
'll go to *Rachov and 
then we 'll see what's  
going to happen.  So 
we go into this train and 
I as ke d this  girl  how do you say i n H
ungaria n good-ni ght  or good e veni ng?  
I learned this and I said
 you take the tickets an
d I will sit here and slee
p and when the conductor 
comes to check t he tickets
 you handl e it.  Sur e e nough he co
me s to t ake the tic kets  a nd *Rachov  
wa s the  ne xt  st ation.  Wh en
 we  arrive  in *Rachov I see a tumult, a 
lot of soldiers  arou
nd.  I said this 
is just perfect.  In Europe when 
you go out fr om the railroad statio
n they t a ke your tic ket whe n you 
walk out and they lo
ok at everybody in the fa ce
.  In this little town ever
ybody knows each other.  
Wh en we got to the gate
 I said in Hungarian[*
815].  This  me ans  good
 evening.  
So  t h e  g u y  
answers[*816] and salutes.
  We went out and we went to this
 *mac h tainiste.  This was agai n a 
Friday night.  We get there and 
t he gi rl knoc ks on the door a n d 
the *mach tainiste
 comes out and  
ope ns  the  door a nd s he  didn't r ecogni ze t he girl .  Fi
rst of all she was maybe ten days in the woods 
and she  di dn't eat and s o 
on.  So s he t old her who she i s.  Shes t arted l a me nting you ca n't stay her e,  
it is da nger o us and all  ki nds  of st orie s.  So I  sai d 
to the woman, look you do
n't have t o give  nothi n g  
to me.  I don't ne ed not hi ng, but thi s i s your rel ati
ve.  So she s ays oka y.  Th
is was after Succos.  She 
said my neighbor next door
 has there a succa.  Go in
 there and you w
ill stay there over
night.  So I 
said look I will stay there only if 
your neighbor kno
ws about it beca
use I don't want 
him to come out  
and catch a thief.   
So the woma n gave us
 a glass of milk, bu
t cold because it's 
Shabbos  and woul dn't  
be  he ated a n d we  st
ayed over night.  I  sai d  we  
won't go in the succa, we'll 
go in your outhous e, not  
the nei ghbor 's.  We went  
in this outhouse and the 
wi nd bl ows  and t he  door 
goes open and closed. 
So I took out from my
 shoe the shoelace and I ti ed up t he 
door.  I n t he mo rn
ing t he woman comes 
out and s he gave the girl
 some  mone y  a nd sa ys 
go over t her e.  There's 
a synagogue an
d they will 
help you.  She  di dn't  hel p anymor
e.  She  spoke  Hungaria n 
so I was not go
od for  her .   She goes  a wa y  
and I go in the street and 
I go to this big buildin
g where she shows me  the 
synagogue and I see it's  
full of soldiers there.  It  was taken over by the 
ar my and t h ey ma de  the i r bar r ac ks t here  in the  
synagogue.  Further down 
t he block I see a Jew coming t her e w
ith a tallis so 
I  st opped hi m and 
aske d hi m where 's t he s h ool a nd he s ays don't go in 
her e.  The r e 's a barr ac ks here.  And he showed  
me t her e is a not her s ynagogue.  He went there .  
He opened up, there wa s a 
padl oc k on t he door .  He  
says , go insi de.  I  will  put up t h
e padlock fr om the outs
ide so that nobody will
 know some body went 
in here.  Sure 
enough he we
nt away. I sit dow
n and there wa s a big iron stov
e ther e, heated up.  I sat  
down and fell asleep.  All of a 
s udden I  wa ke  up a nd I  di dn't  
know where I am
.   I think I'm 
drea mi ng.  I  see all t he  Je ws  ther
e with the Streimel, fur hats and 
so on and everybody is singing and 
dancing a nd I wa s sl eepi ng t hroug
h t he whole cer e mony.  
One of t he Jews co
me s ove r to me  an d  
asks me where ar e you fr om
.  I told him.  He says
 you know wh at, 
do you see this 
ge nt le man there,  

this Jew, when we ar e going hom
e, you foll ow hi m.  He  knows 
about it, you follo
w him.  So I 
follow this Jew to the house
 and we 'r e coming in.  There are hi s wi
fe  a nd t h ree da ughter s but  he t old 
me, don't  tal k t o my wi fe
, don't  tell  her nothi ng b
ecause she will  be afr ai d. 
 I  ate ther e and then he 
says  t o  go ba ck to t he  s ynagogue. 
 I  went  back t o  t he  s
yna gogue.  He  t old me 
t hat  t he  pa dloc k would  
be open like it was in th
e morning.  I sat down 
and there came in a c
ongregation, they call it 
*shalisheedos[ph880]
 
 
The third me al of the sabbath.
 
 
That 's ri ght .  They came there. 
 They were  si nging an
d eating a nd dri nki ng and t he y s ay the  next  
day I will go to Marmarosz-sighet.
 
 
Ro ma ni a.
 
 
Ye s b ut t his wa s Hu ngar y.  S o h e

We 're going to jump 
ahead a little bit if you don'
t mind.  I'm interested in
 knowing about your time 
with the partisans.  Could you te
ll me a little bit abou
t how you got involved 
with it, what you did 
there?
 
 
Yea h, but  again it 's  the s a me .  It 's t oo l ong.  
 
 
Tell me about the major parts.
 
 
The maj or parts.  In 194
4, August  the 28th erupt ed a n upri si ng 
in Sl ovakia.  It wa s organized by 
Russia n par atrooper s a n d the ba rra
c ks of the Sl ova kia n ar my.  Th
ere's a di fference bet ween t h e 
Czechosl ova kian army and the Slovakian army.  They were in th
e  ba rrac ks and t he  Russia ns drove 
in with a truck to the barr
acks and he said here we 
give you a choice, do you 
wa nt  to  b e  wit h  u s  or  
against us?  So  they join
ed this uprising and we  we
re a group of 20 people. 
 I said don't rush into 
somet hing because we di dn
't know who was the leader .  The 
communi st par ty to
ok over the Russian 
partis an move ment and t h e de mocra tic  gover n ment  
ha d a bra nc h in London. 
 We ha d the r e a Pol i sh 
lieute nant, he was  J e w, a nd he  got
 in touc h thr ough t he  Sl ovakian 
ar my wit h London
 and the army  
wanted us to join the ar
my, and the Russian
s  wa nt ed us  t o j oin the  part
isans.  This 
whole  move me nt  
lasted t w o mont hs.  The n  the Ger m
ans encircled it and we  went in 
t he  woods.  I  for got  to me nti on  

wh en we  we re tak e n fr o m t he ghe
tto to the railroad station I lear
ne d s o me thing from t he Ger ma ns  
right  t here.  Ther e came a t ruc
k of German soldiers 
to the town where we
 were and partisans  
encircled and took them off t he tr uc
k.  They were standing
 on t he si de of t h e roa d, about  40 Ger ma n  
soldiers .  All of a sudden they 
di sper s ed t he Ge r m ans .  Everybody 
we nt in a di fferent di rection a nd 
you couldn't shoot because 
you woul d shoot  civil ians .   All  thes
e Germans escaped.  So I took an 
example from this an
d I told them if we
 go to this village if we 
run away, everyb
ody has to run  
away i n a di fferent direct
ion.  But it didn't come to
 it.  So the Germans came
 in and encircled this 
wh ole piece of land.  It
 went fr om *Bratislava [ph955]  to 
*Korshitza [p h955].  
Wh en the Germans 
came cl oser  we decided we had 
to go in the woods.  Ther e was 
a wh ole groups of soldiers,2 
escapees fr om the POW camps and 
t here was even an Ameri can B2
9 bomber  lande d  the r e and he 
coul dn't  ge t out  of it  bec ause  t he  la wns  were  wet  
and he couldn't start.  We
 wen t  i n  the  wo od s  an d  
all of a sudden (I was 
ver y good i n  ori enting myse
l f by the  star s  or by t he  
trees and so on
) and we all 
thought that we're goi ng eas
t t o meet  a Russian ar
my but I st opped and I 
said no we 'r e not going 
east, we 're going nort h a nd nort h are  the  Ger ma n s.
  There's t he t o wn of 
*Karzhmarop[ph973] and 
some  other  t owns  a nd I  s topped t here  one  of the  Ru
ssian officers and one of
 the Americans and they  
took out a map and they t
ook a soldier on a horse and they sent  
hi m ahead on t he fir st  line and t old  
hi m t o come back.  So they ca
me  back and they tu
rned around and we we
nt east.  Th ere the 
Russians were ther e pr ett y close 
so we came t here it started snowi ng already and we came t her e on 
top of the mountain *Prashiva[[p
h985] is the name of this mo unt
ain and the Russian
s sent home the 
Slovakian soldiers, they didn't have
 confidence in them and only th
ey ke pt t he POWs
 or groups  like  
we  tha t  we  c oul dn't go hom
e.  We were t here a coup
le of days on this mo unt
ai n and t hen they sai d 
they will go east to try to join 
the Russian army.  I didn't like the 
idea and I told my
 friends when 
ever ybody is  going your wa
y I  would like  to sta y he
re .  Why?   I sai d t hey
 had the headquarters of 
the partisans and they had 
there laying around bags 
of lentils and in
 the snow were frozen big beef 
liver and another piece of me
at.  So that's all stories.
 
 
I 'd like t o know ma ybe a bout t he stor y of how you 
met up with your wi fe . 
 Coul d you t ell us t hat?
 
 
Wh en I we nt with my  wife ..Anyhow
 after this whole episode we we
nt  thr ough the fro
nt and in the  
valley they were shooting 
and we were on to
p of the mountain 
and went  t hr ough the  front a nd ca me  
out be hind t he fr ont  line s on the 
Russian side.  The first soldiers 
we met t here were Romani ans an d 
these Romanians were starving. Th ey didn't have any food.  We  
had food but we 
didn't ha ve a n y  
cigarettes so we chan
ge d wit h the  Roma ni an s oldier s, brea d 
for cigaret tes.  Af
ter we passed the 
fr ont  line t he y t ook us t o t he barr ack
s and the officers 
were  mo st ly J e ws.
 
 
In t he Russ ia n?
 
 

No, i n the Czechosl ovaki an ar my.  
There were Czechoslovaks wer e se
nt by the Russi ans to Si berian 
and t he n the y ca me  ba ck 
wit h the ar my the y organize d i n Si beri
a.  They were mostly Jews because 
they were running 
away from the Germ
ans, fr om Hitler.
 
 
This is the ar my in exile.  There we re two Czech ar mies if I'm not mi staken.
 
 
Yeah.  Ther e wer e t w o Poli sh ar mi
e s, too.  One  of my br others wa
s in the west in the Polish army  
and the ot he r one was with the Russi ans in the east
.  Anyhow we  went ther
e and I  ha d no idea  i f  
some body li ves or doe sn't 
live a nd we went t o Buch
arest .  I hear d that in Bucharest  t he JOI N T i s  
active but the war was 
still on.  We  met the Russia
ns and we had to 
give up our ar ms
 and I had left 
around so me  bull ets and we were 
there with some Romani
an soldiers that  we
re collaborating with 
the Russi ans.  The Russi ans gave t h
e m guns  but t hey di dn't gi ve t h
e m bull ets.  So the y bought fr o m  
us the bullet s and we we nt
 to Buchar est.  I t hought I had a l o t 
of money t here .  It was  quite a fe w 
thousand lei.  We came to
 Buchar est and we went  to
 ta ke  bat h s in the  publi c
 bat hs .  The  money was  
just e nough for the  bat h a nd a gla
ss of soda.  I got in touch with th
e JOINT.  I knew 
I have a cousi n 
in Israel, in Tel Aviv.  He went 
out  of Poland be fore t he war .  
Hi s na me was Saltz ma n.  So I wr ote  
the address Salts man, Tel 
Avi v.  The first na me  I 
knew, t oo, Bini m.  We wer e there i n Bucharest 
two, three weeks.  After three weeks I go  and th
e y sa id t here 's a not e 
ther e for me.  So what  
happe ned.  The y found this Saltz
ma n and they gave hi m the  note an
d the y found out 
the first time 
that  I ' m alive a nd my one brot her  
wa s wit h  my  co usin  t h
er e.  My c ousi n  had there  a  ta nner y  durin g  
the war and did busine ss  wi
th the English.  Elizabet
h ha d her e be fore t his  piec e of pa per fr om t he  
JOINT.  They write that I'm here
 a nd my brot hers  are here  a nd one
 br other i s there  and one brot her  
is in the Polish

Can we jump a little and 
see how cl ose t o  your  ti
me of liber at ion.  Wh ere wer e you and what  was  
goi ng on a nd how were  you liber ate d?
 
 
Liberated?  I liberated my
sel f .  I  cr os sed t he border
 there.  When I went t o
 Buchar est I was already 
liberat ed.
 
 
I wasn't  clear if the JO
INT wa s already operating.
 
 
The JOINT operated there becaus e 
Bucharest  was li berated by the Ru
ssians before.  But Budapest 
wa s li berat e d onl y t he middle  of J anuary 1945.
 
 
You were in Hungary?
 

 
I was in Bucharest and t h
en  we  wen t  to  Bu da pest
 and then I wa s looking 
for  my wi fe .  I  ha d the  
addr ess and I wa lk i n.  The buil ding i s sta ndi ng bu
t there was a big hole in 
the building fr om the top 
to the bottom.  Th
e  bomb we nt in but  di dn't expl
ode.  I we nt into the stai
rcase and I se e some body is 
coming down and there she wa
s.  She  di d not r ecogniz e
 me at first either an
d then she said are you 
that Henr y?   And I sai d yes .  It happene d s o t hat
 she  ha d a guy waiti ng outsi
de  for  her, a date .  So 
she di dn't even go back t o
 hi m.  We  we nt upstair s 
in the apart ment.  I have
 other episodes with the  
partisans.
 
 
Anything t ha t sta nds out  i n yo
ur mi nd, a particular adventure?
 
 
We  were a group of Jews  there wi
th the partisans and they sent  us
 out  on miss ions to put  bomb s  
under t he  tra cks  and so o
n.  Among other  things there  ca me  a  Je
wis h group of four  or  fi ve me n. 
They were wit h t he English air for
ce.  They came fr om Isr ael but  
t here  was  no Isr a el yet.  The y  
wer e  wit h  th e Ha ga na.   The y  ca me
 with the idea to bring out the few thousand Jews hi ding in the 
woods in Sl ovaki a and t h ey
 came with the idea to 
ma ke a  bri dge.  The y wa nt
ed to take out by plane  
the group of Jews that we
re in the woods .  The y go
t i n touc h or we got  in 
t ouc h wit h t h e m and t he y 
wa nte d to t a ke out our gr oup, t here 
were s o me 20 Poli sh boys and girl
s and they want ed us t o be the  
fir st  ones  c o mi ng out .  But the n  
the war started, the up
rising collapsed.  Ther
e was with us a young 
ma n by the name of Chaim *Hermish
[ph1165]  When we  cr
oss ed the  fr ont  t he Russ ians t ook out  us ,  
the Poli sh gr oup, t hey di dn't know 
what to do with us so they gave
 us  to t h e Czec hosl o vaki an ar my. 
The r e was t h is Chai m He r mi sh a nd another Isra eli sold
ier.  There wasn 't an Is
rael t hen.  They went  
to Ode ssa  and from Ode s sa they se
nt them back to Palestine.  This
 was the end of Chaim He rmish. 
After the war, in 1950, we
 went t he fi rst ti me t o Israel from 
Europe .  Thi s Chai m 
Her mish, he  went  
to Pale stine  and he  went  on t he radi o and he  was r
eadi ng a list of names.  
Among ot her s  he ha d my 
na me .  Somebody hea r d it on the ra
dio, a friend of my  brother's an
d he c alled hi m up and he sa ys  
some body heard your  
br other .   So he  s ays  what  a r e you cra z
y and this time he 
didn't have yet from 
the J OI N T. And he c all ed up t h
e ra dio station a nd a ske d who t his
 wa s.  So the y gave hi m t he  
addr ess of this Chai m 
He r mi sh.  My brothe r 
 
we nt a nd looked hi m up i n a ki
bbut z a nd he wa s si tting wit h hi m 
t here  the whole ni ght and he  was  
telling him stories about me. 
 This was how he heard 
the first time.  I wanted
 to get in 
touch with 
this Chaim Hermish.  So
 my br othe r couldn't  ca tch hi m.  They
 sai d he is a *s helea ch [ph1207]  
so me where in Sout h America and he 
is  not  t here .   It  took yea rs. 
 My brot her  pa sse d a wa y  in t he  
me anti me .  I n 1 97 0 my  b r othe r was  
hardly ali ve.  He says t o me 
I hear d Chai m Her m
ish lives in the  
kibbutz *Glitzon [ph1217] this is 
in the north near Haifa.  So I 
called him up and th
ey told me yes 
he li ves  here  but he i sn't here  now.  I n  
1970 I  finall y met  hi m 
a n d it  was  a re uni on.
 
 
I wa nt to tha nk you ver y
 much.  You have 
ha d ma ny a dvent ure s .  At s o me t i me ma ybe we c a n hear  
mo re of them.  I really
 appreciate your time.
