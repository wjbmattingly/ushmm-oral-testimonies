[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  
An
na,
 
thank  you s o muc h for  being willing to join us  today and be our Fir s t Pers on
. 
We 
have s o m uc h for  you to s har e with us  and we have s o little time, s o we will s tart right away.
 
 
You wer e just 13, Anna, when World War II began with Germany's  invas ion of 
Poland, 
September
 
1, 1939
. 
Befor e we tur n to all that happened to you and your  fam ily during the war and the 
Holoc aus t, let's s tar t fir s t with you telling us a little bit about your fam ily, your  c om munity, and you in the 

year s  befor e the war began.
 
> > Anna
 
Gr os z:  Yes
. 
Hello firs t
. 
Thank  you for  c oming to lis ten to m y story
. 
I have to tell that Bill made 
a mistake
. 
I am not 90 bec aus e I tur ned the 9 to a 6, like this
. 
So I'm 60 not 90.

[Laughter]

> > Anna Gros z:  I have a short time to tell my
 
s tory but I'm going to tr y to take jus t the es s enc e
. I
n one 
year  what leads  to the family and all of us J ewis h people is  unbelievable
. 
The tortur e and the 
hum iliation and s omething that I s om etim es think, 
A
m  I still nor mal
? 
I doubt it s ometimes, you know.
 
 
Befor e the war we had a nic e fam ily life
. 
My father was  a wine m er c hant
. 
I had five s is ters
. 
So 
ther e wer e s ix gir ls
. 
The older  gir ls  wer e s ent to high s c hool and the younger  gir ls  wer e in s c hool
. 
I was  
only 14 year s  old when the Hungar ian oc c upied 
Trans ylvania
. 
Ever ybody  will know this  bec aus e that's 
how they m ake the horr or m ovies , from Tr ans ylvania.
 
 
The first thing what they did, they stopped the J ewis h people to go to high s c hool
. 
So that was  
the fir s t tragedy for  m e bec aus e I c ouldn't go to hig h s c hool like my older  sis ter s.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to ask you just a c ouple of ques tions befor e we go ther e, if you don't m ind
. I 
hope later you'll talk m ore about what that los s of educ ation m eant to you
. 
But your  father , he had been 

a dec orated soldier  in the Firs t World War, hadn't he? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes, he was
. 
In the Fir stWor ld War he was  in Hungar y
. 
And bec aus e the Ger mans  
los t the war, in the Fir s t WorldWar als o, it bec am e Rom ania
. 
And the s ame thing happened in the 
Sec ond Wor ld War bec a
us e the Hungar y allied the Ger m ans
. 
They gave it back to the Hungar ians
. 
So 
that's  why we becam e Hungarians  again.
 
 
My father mar ried m y m other in Rom ania s o he r em ained in Romania.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna
 
--
 
> > Anna Gros z:  As I s aid befor e
 
--
 
> > Bill B ens o
n:  One more question.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes ?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e your par ents, both your m other and father, were ver y r es pected members  
of the c omm unity
. 
Can you tell us about that?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
I could s ay they were ver y honor ed people becaus e my father was  very c or rec t 
m an
. 
E ver y
one
 
who 
bought the wine and the brandy from him, they bought it in advanc e bec aus e they 
knew that he will deliver  it 100% what he s old.
 
 
My par ents
 
--
 
what I had, I had no s c hool educ ation but I have it fr om m y par ents and m y very 
s tr ict grandmother
. 
They taught us  m anner s  and dis c ipline
. 
So when she died, I was n't s o s orry for her  
bec aus e I did not like what s he wanted m e to do
. 
[Laughter ]
 
 
Let m e go back  to the fam ily life, what we had
. 
We lived in peac e
. 
Ever ybod
y had a job
. 
My 
older  s is ters  were in s c hool
. 
Gis ela did not go to s c hool bec aus e we had a little busines s at home als o, 
a textile s tore.
 
I helped out m y father with going to the vineyard, ar ranged for wor kers  and ever ything.
 
 
One day 
--
 
we did not know anything that happened in the world
. 
We had two s tations  on the 
r adio, Budapest and [Indis c er nible]
. 
We did not know what happened in the world that the Germ ans  
oc c upied already or  s omething
. 
Nothing about the war
. 
Only that they oc cupied Tr ansylvania and th
en 
c hanged ever ything
. 
Sc hools , offic es , ever ything in Hungar ian fr om Romanian.
 
 
Not long after  that s tarted, they took  away the lic ens e fr om the stor e
. 
They did not let J ewish 
people out without the yellow s tar
. 
They c ouldn't k eep non
-
J ewis h help
. 
So from
 
one to the other, we 
were not allowed to even go to the street without that yellow s tar.
 
 
In May
 
4, Tr ans ylvania was  oc c upied on 
M
ar c h
 
--
 
the 4th of Marc h, 1940.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  1940.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  1940
. 
In 1944, Hungar y was the las t c ountr y that the G
erm ans  oc c upied fr om  the 
whole Eur ope
. 
In 1940.
 
 
So when they did all the things to us, that they did not let us  out
. H
um iliation, even a gyps y 
s aid I am what I am but I am not a J ew
. 
So we wer e totally hum iliated
. 
I don't know, to me that's  even 
wors e 
than s uffer ing the hum iliation.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And Anna, after the Hungarians  did all of thes e terrible things to you, they took  away 

your  fam ily bus ines s , they took  away the textile bus ines s
 
--
 
> > Anna Gros z:  They took  away everything.
 
> > Bill Bens on: 
 
How did your fam ily
 
--
 
you had a lot of m ouths to feed
. 
How did your  fam ily manage to 
m ake it?
 

4 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  My father took c ar e of that before
. 
We had flour, bread
. 
We ha
d br andy 
--
 
what we 
s old, bec aus e we had the brandy mac hine als o
, w
e sold that
, e
v
en to help other  people.
 
 
So it c ame the day, May
 
4, fam ily by family they took  all of us  in the s ynagogue
. 
They s aid 
that we c an take food with us  for four days .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you m ind if I go back  and ask  you a c ouple of questions ?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  
Sure.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before that happened, your  father  was  c ons c r ipted into one of the Hungarian labor 
battalions .
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about that.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Well, the wors t thing was
 
--
 
firs t thing and the wor s t thing was they took  for forc ed 
labor  all the young men fr om about 18 to 45 or s o
. 
They took  all the m en who was  the hear t of the 
people and rem ain wer e the c hildr en and the old people with the young people
. 
They took  them to 
for c
ed labor, in the c ountr y and als o I think in other parts of Hungar y
. 
They wor ked s o hard
. 
They 
tortured them .
 
 
I don't know
. 
I s till don't have the ans wer  for that
. 
If they wanted to kill us bec aus e we were the 
enem y, the J ewis h people, why did they have to tor ture us befor e that
? 
Why did they do that before the 
killings ? 
 
 
One exam ple, who did not happen to m e but to my hus band, it was  two J ewis h people ther e 
who were for c ed labor ers
. 
A Hungar ian s oldier who was  the guar d with them  s aid, "You s ay that you 
ar e a s tinky J ew."  The m an s aid, "Why s hould I s ay that?"  And he s aid, "Bec aus e I told you s o."  So 

he s aid
, 
"If you don't s ay that you are a stinky J ew, I'm  going to beat you."  So he s aid
 
--
 h
e went to the 
other people and he s aid, "You s ay als o that you are a s tinky J ew."  And he s aid, "Why s hould I s ay 
that
? 
I am a c ollege profes s or ."  "If you don't s ay that, I'm going to beat you."  He did not s ay that
. 
And 
he s tarted to beat him until he was  half dead
. 
Then he s aid, "I am a stinky J ew."
 
S o this is
- - 
s im ilar  
hum iliation happened, whic h I c an't s ay all of them  but it happened.
 
 
Let m e go back .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yes
. 
You wer e going to tell us about your father
. 
They took  him away and you never  
s aw him  again.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  My father  was  s ent in a c amp
.  
He was  a tr ans lator for a while from Germ an to 
Hungar ian
. 
He was  s ent a pos tc ar d, near  Budapes t, in the c amp
. 
We never heard after that of him
, 
w
hat happened to him
. 
We didn't know what happened.
 
 
After we wer e taken, the whole little town, 50 J ewis h families , they took  us  in the s ynagogue 
and we s tayed ther e for  about two or thr ee days
. 
And that s ynagogue, the c hildr en and the old people 
[Inaudible] in the throat
. 
It was  a terr ible thing
. 
We didn't know why and what's going to happen after  
that.
 
 
After fo
ur days  they put us  in c arr iages
. 
The non
-
J ewis h people had to c arr y us  about 
37
-
kilometers  from  our hom es  in a ghetto wher e only J ewis h people c ould live there
. 
They took  the 
hous es  fr om non
-
J ewis h people to have r oom there
. 
We didn't stay too long there
. 
And then they said 
take food for four days  with you
. 
And you still didn't know what happened
. 
I s houldn't s ay a s urpr is e
. It 
was  a s hock to us bec aus e it c am e only that we didn't know what happened befor e that in the wor ld.
 
So in the ghetto we s tayed 
ther e for about
 
--
 
s weeping down the floors , mos tly c hildren and old wom en 
bec aus e men wer e not ther e.
 
 
And after four  days  they took I don't know how m any people, took them to the tr ain station, 
and they put them in a wagon there
. 
When they took  our fam i
ly, I was  the 92nd in that wagon
. 
We didn't 
know wher e is  m y m other  wher e is  my sis ter bec aus e they pus hed us  in
. 
 
It was a battle in the c or ner  of 
the wagon
. 
To go out, they did a danc e
. 
Fr om  time to tim e the wagon opened to em pty
. 
But to stay four 
days  in that tr ain, the c hildr en cr ied, the old m en prayed, s ome of them c ursed, "Why did this  happen to 

us ?" 
 

5 
 
 
I tried to take one of m y m os t terr ible days  fr om the whole depor tation or  Death Mar c h, I 
thought is  that, the tr aveling four days , and after that the
y let us out in Ausc hwitz
. 
Later I found out that 
not that was  the m ost terr ible day in m y life.
 
 
They let us  out
. 
It was  at night
. 
We wer e all dizz y and didn't know what happened to us
. 
Dogs  
bark
ing, the Ger m an s oldier s  s aid, "F
ast, fas t, fas t."  And they
 
took  us  to a plac e
. 
And the m us ic  played
. 
J ewis h m us ic  players  played
. 
They wanted the c haos , m ake it a little bit mor e s uppor ted.
 
 
So they took  us
. 
A German offic er  c ame with a stic k
. 
My s is ter  had m y older s ister 's  baby, 
3-
year
-
old gir l, in her hand
. 
He
 
c am e to her and as ked, "Is  this  your  baby?"  And s he s aid
 
no.
  
Then s he 
s aid, "Give it to her  m other
. " B
ec ause if a baby take away fr om the mother, they tried to c ry
. 
S o s he 
gave it back to the m other
. 
But if s he wouldn't, then s he would be asked to go in
 
the left s ide wher e the 
people were killed
. 
They didn't even m ake a differenc e one will live or  one will die.
 
 
So my mother, m y older s is ter with the baby, and m y younger s is ter , 14 years  old, was  taken 
to one s ide
 a
nd Elizabeth, my older s ister, 25, Gis ela, 20, I was  18, Clar a was  16, on another s ide
. 
They took  us in a r oom
. 
Firs t of all, we had to tak e off our c lothes  and then sit in a c hair and they
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Shaved you? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  They took  us, c ut off our hair, any wher e we had hair
.I 
don't know what I s aid bec ause 
I don't think  that I s aid anything bec aus e I was  s o tir ed fr om  the four  days  tr aveling in that train
. 
What 
happened to me, it happened
. 
I c ouldn't c omprehend what happened.
 
 
So all four of us s is ters  was  taken in another room
 
wher e we were dis infected with s om e white 
dus t
. 
And after  that we got a gray dr ess  with a num ber on the s leeve bec aus e they did not have time to 
tattoo us like other people before they did bec ause we wer e the las t people who wer e oc c upied
. 
Hungar y was  the
 
las t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e that bec aus e there wer e jus t s o m any c om ing in fr om Hungary they jus t 
didn't have the tim e to tattoo you
 a
nd that's why.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
Bec aus e s o m any, the las t ones  were Hungarian, the las t c ountr y was  Hungary.
 
M
any plac es  already the war was  over  alr eady but they s till put the J ewis h people in trains and 
deported to Aus chwitz
, 
Hungary did
. 
They were alr eady liberated s ome plac es  becaus e it was  1944 
and 1945 was  over
. 
Right? 
 
 
So we wer e in Aus c hwitz
. 
Yes, they put us
 
--
 
we s lept in a s tall
. 
One per s on c ame and s he 
s aid
 
--
 
s he was  fr om  Czec hos lovakia
. 
She was  there for four years already in the c onc entr ation c am p
. 
She s poke Hungarian als o
. 
We ask ed her  what's happening to us
. 
"Where are our parents ?"  And she 
s ai
d, "You s ee that sm oke
? 
T
her e are your  parents ."  It was  very c los e
, 
Aus c hwitz, to the c r ematory 
r oom
. 
We thought that she is  crazy
. 
What? 
We didn't even k now the wor d, what c r em atory is , and how 
about believe that they killed there in the c rem atorium
. 
We 
didn't believe her
. 
We s aid s he's  a bad 
per s on, that's  all.
 
 
So they took us in Aus c hwitz, put us in s ome beds
. 
There was  no c over ing
. 
Ever y day they 
c ounted us, in the m orning and at night
. 
And the food was ter r ible, terr ible
, s
ome beets, s om e other , 
c ook ed
, a
 
little piece of m argar ine in the m or ning, and a very s mall piec e of bread.
 
We had to s tay in 
the line
. 
Always  we s tayed in the line at night
 a
d in the morning
. 
They c hos e people who were very  
s kinny, who were very fat
. 
They took  them away
. 
You never  hear d of them again.
 
J us t r emained, 
people who were s tr ong
-
looking
. 
But they always  did that s elec tion, all the tim e when we wer e ther e.
 
 
So one s aid that they c hoos e people for wor k
. 
We wer e s o happy for  our s is ter s and a few 
other girls  from  the town, th
at we go for wor k  anywher e but not stay here.
 
So they c hos e us for work
. 
Or 
for a while
 
--
 
we had to hide Elizabeth, m y older s is ter, bec aus e s he was  skinnier than the thr ee of us  
and s m aller.
 
 
So they c hos e us  for work
, 
800 of us
 w
ho looked fit to work
. T
hat's what they s aid
. 
They took  
us  to Stutthof wher e we s tayed one day
. 
By the train they took  us  there
. 
We s aw the s un
. 
We s aw the 
nature
. 
Oh, we thought, what a nic e thing they pres ented us to go to work
. 
A pr ize
, th
at's  what we s aid.
 
So when we arr ived in Stutthof, they did again the s elec tion
. 
We wer e not all good for wor k  but the four 
of us still r em ained ther e, the s isters.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J us t a minute
. 
I'll jum p in.
 

6 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes ?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In addition, you would line up five in a r ow
. 
And bes ides you and your thr ee s isters , 
ther e was  a fifth wom an who s tayed with you thr oughout.
 

> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
We had to stay five in a r ow
. 
So we had one pers on ther e who had nobody ther e, 
no s is ters , nobody
. 
She's still alive, 94 years  old and s he has the dementia
. 
Y es.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So from Stutthof they took  you to a plac e c alled Pr aust, whic h was  a br and new c am p.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
They took  us to Pr aust whic h befor e was  a big farm
. 
The plac e was  not r eady yet 
to work
. 
It was  ter rible hot
. 
It's near Gdansk
. 
The sun was  burning
. 
We had shor t s leeve dr es s and 
s hor t dr ess
. 
We had to go to a place and field the s traw s acks  that would be our bed
. 
All day long we 
had to do that
. 
And s ome gir ls  put s ome paper on their legs  to c over it
. 
And the paper was  c em ent
. 
So 
then they took  it off, it c ame off with the skin.
 
What did they do
? 
They s ent us back  to Stutthof becaus e 
they c ouldn't work  anym or e and they br ought new people ins tead of them
. 
Of c ours e, we never heard 
of them bec aus e in Stutthof was  another cr emator y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, you told m e that it was  always  800 wom en, as  you wer e s aying
. 
So if s ome wer e 
ill, they s ent them back  and then they would bring back the s am e number s o you had 800.
 
 
And then you wer e forc ed to do exc eptionally hard labor
. 
Tell us  about that.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Well, we had to do air port fr om that big
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e for c ed to build an airfield
. 
Right?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
We had to take first the vegetables  from  that far m
. 
It was  c arr ots, beets m ostly, 
an
d a few potatoes
. 
We wer e told we c annot take fr om ther e to eat bec ause we are going to b
e 
punis hed for that if you do that
. 
But we were very hungr y bec aus e s inc e the first day we ar rived there 
was  no food, no water
. 
The water  was r usty
. 
So we c ouldn't drink  or eat
. 
And s om e people still took  
c ar r ots  and ate it or a potato or  s om ething
. 
But the num ber was  her e on the s leeve
. 
And the guar ds 
s aw that
, t
hen took  the number
. 
 
 
And at night when we went hom e from  work, the guar d gave it to
 
--
 
ther e were two wom e
n
. 
I 
think  they wer e at leas t 250 or 230
 
pounds
. 
It was  their job to do the punis hm ent and als o to arrange 
the food for us . So in the fir st night, the guar d gave the number bec aus e the gir ls  took the food
. 
The 
punis hment was  like that
. 
She had to bend off and the two devils  c ame
. 
I don't know how to c all them
. 
And 
they gave 25
 
las hes on the back  of them
. 
And the next day they have to pr es ent for work
 n
o matter  
how they felt
. 
That was  fir s t day
. 
We didn't know what the punis hm ent would be.
 
 
So the work 
started. 
Our wor k was  to fill s and
. 
A plane c am e
. 
Fill the 
c art
. 
And another tr ain 
c am e and another
. 
All day we had to fill thos e c arts  with the s and.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So jus t to be s ure we all understand
. 
You wer e filling tr ain c ar s full of sand
. 
That was
 
your  job, to fill s and.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  It was  not full of s and
. 
For example, m y s ister Clar a
 
c ould not work  as  har d bec ause 
s he was  16, like us
. 
We had to wor k harder  to be full, that c art
. 
I don't k now how to s ay that in Englis h
. 
It look s  like this  s om e
how
. 
That does n't m atter .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the s and was  us ed then to make the pavement.
 

> > Anna Gros z:  Make the pavement, yes
. 
And Frenc h pr is oners  were far
 
away 
fr om us
. 
They build the 
guar d to put the air planes  in at night
. 
They still have it here, 
too
. 
I never  s aw it.
 
That's  what happened
. 
We had this  work with ver y little food
. 
We all los t weight
. 
That's what we did all s umm er.
 
 
Then we had a guard with us
. 
There were many guar ds  but one we had from  Romania
. 
He 
s poke in Rom anian
. 
He was  a nic e guy
. 
He never  gave a num ber to the Germ an wom an who was  his  
gir lfr iend
. 
But the other guar ds , they gave the num ber
. 
And alm ost every day we had s omebody get 
punis hed
. 
But we have to s tay and s ee the punishm ent like this
. 
You tense up
. 
And did not have dinner  
u
ntil all the people who wer e ins ide c ome out and get the dinner
. 
 
 
That was  a s adist thing to do
. 
I don't know why
, 
I r epeat again, why did they have to tortur e us 
before they kill us
? 
I don't know this
. 
Many things  I don't know.
 
 
S o finally
 
--
 
I have to m
ake m y stor y s hor t
. 
It c ame Chris tmas  tim e
. 
They wanted us  to 
entertain them
. 
So they pr ovide a piano, violin, and there wer e many talented people, oper a s inger s
. 
They s aid ever ybody s hould go who has  a talent.
 

7 
 
 
I left out something
. 
That Romanian s oldier,
 
s omehow he r egretted but he had to go in the 
Germ an Arm y
. 
He liked me to s ing for him Romanian s ongs , popular  ballads
. 
Ever y tim e he was  with 
us , he wanted m e to s ing for  him
. 
At that tim e I had a ver y pretty voic e, inher ited fr om  m y m other.
 
 
So the Christm as  party cam e and all the people were ther e and pres ented what they do
. 
A nd I 
was  s itting in the top of a bunk bed
. 
I was  jus t watc hing
. 
And then that Romanian s oldier  cam e to m e 
and he s aid, "Why didn't you c ome to sing als o
? 
I wanted you to s ing Romanian als o."  And I s aid, "I 
don't think that I was  s uch a talent to go ther e."  But he said, "I want you to c ome."  He 
helped me get 
down from the bed
. 
I fall
. 
I br oke my leg.
 
 
Now, with the sm all s ick nes s  they s ent back the people to Stutthof bec aus e they n
eeded 
another people who was able to work
. 
If you were s ic k  for  two days, they sent back
. 
Now I s aid this  is  
m y end bec aus e with the br oken leg, what c an they do.
 
So m y s is ter begged this  offic er
 
--
 
it was  a 
s oldier , I think, to not s end me back  to Stuttho
f
. 
And bec aus e he s om ehow felt guilty bec aus e he 
wanted m e to go to s ing
, a
nd the one who dec ided to s end back people, it was  his  gir lfr iend, the big 
woman who did the punis hm ent
. I
t was a mirac le that they put my leg in cast
. 
Never  happened
. 
Never  
hear d of any m ir ac le like this
. 
 
 
So they put my leg in c as t in the m or ning
. 
My leg bec ame like this, s wollen
. 
They had to take it 
off and put another c ast
. 
No injec tion or put me to s leep or  s omething
. 
Why? 
I don't know
. 
A human 
being can s ur vive anything
. 
I thi
nk his  own death, als o
. 
I think I'm never  going to die
. 
I'm going to 
s ur vive m y death, too.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, after you broke your leg and this  mir ac le oc c urred, that they put a c ast on you, it 

was n't long after that that then they emptied Praust.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Thr ee weeks  after that s tarted, they took  the people from  all c amps , take to marc h
. 
The c rem ator y c ould not des tr oy them bec aus e the war  was  ver y s hor t to end
. 
So all the people have to 
m ar c h away from the c am p.
 
When the tim e c a
m e that our  c amp had to leave, I c ouldn't walk
. 
S o they 
took off m y s hoes  bec aus e other  26 people wer e chos en who could not marc h
. 
And a few guar ds and 
the people who cooked ther e bec aus e other c amps  c am e and s tayed there for  a night
. 
And after that 
they m
arc hed further.
 
So when our c am p, it was time to marc h, my thr ee s is ters wer e able to marc h but 
I was n't able with the other  26 people who c ouldn't walk.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were left behind.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  I was  left behind, taken of my s hoes  bec aus e I don't need s hoes  bec aus e the 26 
unable to walk people are going to be killed
. 
I didn't even was  afraid
. 
Yes , they put s ome in our food 
that they didn't let us think
. 
It was  brown
. 
Medic ation or s omething
. 
So we c ouldn't even think c lear
. 
They left m e there
. 
I thought I'm  going to s tay here by mys elf killed and my thr ee s isters left
. 
I c ouldn't 
even c ry.
 
 
I was  s itting ther e and the s ec ond mir ac le happened to me
. 
One was  that they put m y leg in 
c as t, whic h never , never,
 
nowher e happened
. 
And then a gir l c am e
 
who worked in the kitc hen
. 
S he 
as ked me, "Cou
ld you do s om e s ewing?"  I s aid
 
yes
. 
My m other wanted all of us  to lear n s om e s ewing
. 
And then s he s aid, "We are m aking s ome c ivilian c lothes for  the SS."  The Germ an people
. 
"If you c an 
s
ew,
 
you c ome with us  and you will do that job."  She provided m e s hoes
. 
I s urvived that
 b
ec ause they 
took m e and I did the s ewing with thos e.
 
 
So what happened, the camps all night c am e from  other c am ps
. 
But they mar ched for  a long 
tim e alr eady
. 
Ever y day died I don't know how many people
. 
They m ade a big hole, a big, big hole, and 
jus t thr ow them dead in that hole.
 
 
When the time c ame that our Ger man people wanted to go, the guar ds
 
--
 
the girl who had with 
the s ewing c am e to m e and s he s aid "You s tay her e bec aus e y
ou'r e going t
o be liberated." We have to 
go again.
 
They want us go with them.
ﬂ 
 
So our c am p left als o
. 
And I r em ained ther e
. F
or two days  it was  quiet
. 
Then we heard that the 
whole airpor t was  blown up, what we did, bec ause it was  bom bed fr om  one plac e to the other
. 
T
hey 
blew out the whole
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Germ ans  blew up their own airfield.
 

8 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  The whole air port
. 
And a block  als o blew up with that who wer e people who c ouldn't 
walk
. 
They were dead als o.
 
 
I c ould alr eady walk a little bit and a few other people
. 
We walked and hided in the bas em ent 
wher e they us ed to keep the food.
 
So for  another two days  it was  quiet
. 
We had
 
--
 
s om ebody c ame out 
fr om  the bas em ent
. 
I c am e out als o
. 
I felt very diz z y
. 
I s aw fr om far away two dots
. 
And thos e two dots  
bec a
me bigger  and bigger and then bec ame two Rus s ian s oldier s
. 
So that meant that we wer e 
liberated, c ame m or e Rus s ian s oldier s .
 
 W
hen I c am e out fr om the bas em ent, I was  dizz y, I was  s ic k
. 
I got Typhus  there in the 
bas ement
. 
Russ ian people did not c are too muc h of us bec aus e they still wer e searc hing for Ger mans
. 
But they took m e in
. 
I really c ouldn't think.
 
I woke up in a house, s ort of this  is  a hos pital
. 
I would s ay I 
s tayed there, I don't know, maybe two weeks  or s o
. 
I didn't know what happened to me
. 
Wh
en I woke 
up, I s aw a Rus s ian nur se dead near  me
. 
She died of Typhus
. 
 
 
And no hair again
. 
They c ut m y hair the sec ond tim e, whic h my hair grew in a year there
. 
A nd 
they gave m e s ome c lothes  bec aus e they took  my old c lothes whic h was  filled with lic e
. 
I ne
ver k new 
that c lothes c an be lic e als o
. 
But in our head, I didn't think I had lic e bec aus e I was  working with thos e 
people
. 
But they took off my hair
. 
They gave me an outfit
. 
I still like to s ay a skir t like a s ack  and a 
blous e
. 
And just nothing on m y head
. 
They s aid now you c an go
. 
So now I was  liber ated.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the little tim e we have left, one of the things  you s aid to me is even though you wer e 
liberated you didn't feel happy at all.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
I said
 
--
 
I'm getting ther e.
 
>> 
[Lau
ghter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Yes
. 
I was  out from that hos pital
. 
I s aw
 
--
 
I never  s aw a m irr or the whole year
. 
B ut I 
s aw myself in a window
. 
I looked at m ys elf
. 
You k now, los t weight in that outfit that I had, and no hair
.I 
think  I started to laugh
. 
That was  my
 
fir s t laugh
. 
 
 
And I go s omewhere
. 
So I didn't know wher e to go.
 
I heard s omewhere mus ic
. 
The Polis h 
people and the Fr enc h started to c elebrate the peac e
. 
It was  Marc h 23 or 21
. 
And I heard mus ic, whic h 
I didn't hear m us ic  s till in m y life
. 
S o I went to h
ear the m us ic
. 
I didn't know how I look  or s om ething
. 
I 
was  s itting like this
. 
Somebody c am e
 
at m y back and he s aid, "Madem oiselle."  Then I had the s econd 
laugh
. 
[Laughter]
 
 
So a Fr enc h pr is oner  c am e
. 
He asked m e to danc e
, t
o go to danc e
. 
Then I started to c ry. 
 
So I s poke Hungarian
. 
He s poke Fr enc h
. 
But we unders tand eac h other
. 
He find out who I am
. 
A nd I 
find who is  he
. 
But I didn't go to danc e with him.
 
Then later he came with a pack of c igar ettes and a 
piec e of bread
. 
He s aid als o in F
r enc h
 
--
 
Fr enc h is a little bit s im ilar  to Romanian
. 
And I under s tand that 
if I want him  to take m e to Par is , to Fr ance
. 
I thought I want to go to France.
 
 
So I didn't know where my s is ter s  are
. 
I knew unfor tunately that I did not want to believe that 
m y p
ar ents  ar e still ther e in the smoke.
 
All of a s udden, people who wer e ar ound, all the people who 
was  liberated
. 
One girl com e to m e and looks at m e long and s he s aid, "Don't you have a s is ter  Gis ela
? 
And I s aid, "Ye
s , I do have."  "And one Carla?
  
I was  wi
th them in
ﬂ 
--
 
I never  know wher e I put my k eys  
but I remem ber what happened then
. 
Ever ything I r em ember
. 
I could go with clos ed eyes  and find my 
bed or anything what happened there.
 
 
So s he s aid, "Your s is ters  ar e liber ated."  She s aid Clar a and Gis ela
. 
ﬁ
And how about 
Elizabeth,
ﬂ  
I asked
. 
She s aid s he was  s hot on the way
 
--
 
when s he was  marc hing on the day of the 
liberation
. 
The Germ ans  killed her bec aus e s he couldn't walk.
 
 
So I find out that two out of my whole family are alive
. 
I had to believe
. 
I did n
ot want to 
believe
. 
I did not want to live
. 
I didn't know wher e m y s is ter s are, even if they are alive
. 
We went fr om 
one train s tation to the other  who were liberated and nobody helped us , not with food, not with going 

hom e
. 
I thought an airplane will c ome
 
and take us home, you know
? 
But for  two months did not com e 
an air plane
. 
We wer e just wander ing there
. 
Nobody car ed of us at all.
 
 
I am thinking this was  my m os t ter r ible day in m y life
. 
It's  har d to find one bec aus e mor e 
terr ible days  in m y life
. 
But the
 
m ost terr ible day was  when my two sis ters c am e home, we m et in our  
em pty hous e, r obbed hous e, knowing that we ar e s till, the three of us, young girls , not trained for life, 

9 
 
not knowing what to start with our life
. 
First, leave and how
. 
And another  problem
, ther e was  no man to 
m arry them bec aus e they all wer e killed in the forc ed labor
. 
And another ter rible thing happened to m e
 
w
hen I saw in a per s on m y m other's  dres s, on the s tr eet
. 
I got hys ter ic al ins ide in my em pty hous e but I 
c ouldn't go out or s ay s om
ething to her .
 
 
After that, when we s tarted a new life
. 
By the time
 
--
 
oh, I thought this was  
Br
andy.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  This  is jus t water
. 
You c heated me.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I have the br andy
. 
[Laughter ]
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Oh, I c ould talk another three hour s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Anna, we ar e going to clos e the progr am  in just a mom ent

We'll be at the c los e of our  progr am  s hor tly

Needless  to s ay we wer e only able to

. 
And we could have had you talk for 
thr ee m ore days .
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Oh, yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And what we don't even begin to touc h upon is what happened after the war , not only 
imm ediately after the war , the c ir c ums tanc es  that Anna began to des c r ibe for us , getting married, and 

then s pending the
 
next 19 years  living under Comm unis t rule befor e Anna and her two s ons  and fam ily

So that m akes f

And then Anna, when

So, pleas e, abs olutely feel free afterwar ds  to c ome up

question, we'll have tim e for a c ouple, pleas e go to one of the two mic r ophones  in the ais le if you would 

and line up there
. 
This  will give you a mom ent to get ther e
. 
We'r e not obvious ly goin
g to get to 
ever ybody's  questions , but, again, Anna will r em ain with us .
 
 
Firs t a question fr om our Twitter audienc e
. 
Question one 
of 
two
 
from  students  at Chris tianburg 
M
iddle 
S
c hool.
 
 
Anna, what experienc es  or  tr ans itions did you find with your  faith
? 
Did
 
you los e your faith in 
God? 
P.S., our  students  ar e loving this  opportunity to hear you and talk  to you.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  I have an ans wer for  that
. 
I was  rais ed to believe in God
. 
Many of us  los t their  faith 
bec aus e they ask ed why  did God let happen this
w
ith the innoc ent people
. 
I think like that God has  
nothing to do with this
. 
People did that
. 
People did that to us
. 
And any bad thing that happens, not God 
did it, people did it to us
. 
That's what I believe.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank s . 
 
 
We'll s ee if we have any body from our audienc e
. 
And if not
 
--
 
we have one here
. 
I think this 
will pr obably be our one question from  the audienc e
. 
And, then, again, when Anna's done, pleas e c om e 
up to the s tage and talk with her and ask  her any ques tions that you would like to 
then.
 

> > Anna Gros z:  Yes.

> > Bill Bens on:  Make your  question as brief as you c an
. 
I'll repeat it jus t to make s ur e that ever ybody 
hear s  it
. 
Then Anna c an res pond.
 
>> 
Anna, thank  you s o muc h
. 
We will never  forget you.
 
My ques tion is
: D
uring the years of C
omm unis m  
in Romania, were you per s ec uted again for being Jewis h?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During your  year s  in Romania, were you per s ec uted for  being J ewis h? 
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Again?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During your  year s  in Romania after the war , for the 19 year s  you 
would remain there, 
were you pers ec uted for being J ewish?
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Not for  being Jewis h but to not be Communis t, to be on the lis t that if you want to 
leave the c ountry, whic h we did, c ould not have the s am e rights or  c ould not go, the c hildr en als o
, to 
higher s c hools
. 
The s ame like the Hungar ians  did
. 
So it was n't a pleas ure to live in a Com munist 
c ountr y
. 
You had a job but it was  s o little or s mall, I don't know how to s ay it, that you c ouldn't live with 
it
. 
So we had to do s om ething with one word,
 
steal
. 
And if you s tole, if they found it, they put you in jail
. 
They s aid ther e wer e three kinds  of people in Rom ania
: 
who is  in jail, who was  in jail, and who will be in 
jail.
 
 
So we wer e very happy when after 19 years  they let us out fr om  Romania
. 
Isr a
el and Amer ic a 
paid for our pas s ports
. 
We wer e lucky that m y two c hildren was  young enough to c ontinue her e the 
education. 
 
 
That's my ans wer
. 
If you have another  ans wer.
 
 
I have s omething without asking me I would s ay
. 
When you buy a hous e, the agent s ays
 
it's  
loc ation, loc ation, loc ation
. 
I would s ay educ ation, educ ation, and educ ation.
 
>> 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Anna Gros z:  Bec ause they took  that away from  m e and I mis s  it for  all m y life
. 
There are s o m any 
things that I would enjoy and know if I would have the educ ation and they did not let m e do that
. 
They 
took that away fr om us
. 
That's like they would tak e m y arm from me bec aus e all m y rest of the family, 
they were educ ated
. 
But I was  that age when Romania was  oc c upied
. 
I was  14, finis hing elementar y 
s c hool.
 
So
 
that's why I s ay you have the oppor tunity her e to have the educ ation and that nobody can 
take it away from you
. 
It's  m ore than millions  of dollars , the educ ation, what you have.
 
 
But don't ask m e one ques tion
. 
This is  not m y first tim e that I'm  here
. 
And 
I had a ques tion
. 
It 
was  a young gir l
. 
She asked m e c ould you forgive and forget what they did to you
. 
And I said, no, I 
c an't, and I don't want to
. 
Bec aus e when took  J esus  Chr is t to cr uc ify, he said don't punish them, God, 
bec aus e they don't know what they are doing
. 
Right? 
But the Germ ans knew what they ar e doing s o 
how c an I forgive and forget
? 
This  is not a small thing to forgive and forget
. 
I will not
. 
And I won't for
give 
and forget
. 
So don't ask  me that question
. 
[Laughter] 
 
Anything els e.
 
> > Bill 
Bens on:  I think we are ready now to c los e the program
. 
Anna, thank  you s o very muc h.
 
> > Anna Gros z:  I thank you all for  lis tening to me
. 
I c ould talk for m or e than an hour
. 
They made a 
good c hoic e for m e to talk  bec aus e I was  punis hed as  a sm all gir l who
 
talk  too muc h.
