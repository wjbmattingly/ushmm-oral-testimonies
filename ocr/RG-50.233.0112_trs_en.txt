My birt hda y, August  12, 1917.
 
 
Ok ay, where were you born?
 
 
In Amsterdam,  in the downtown cen
ter where mo stly Jewish people 
lived.  We  called it the ghetto 
but it wa s not a ghetto at
 all because everybod
y was free to move out or to
 move  in and there lived a 
lot of non-Jews.  But we called it
 the  ghett o bec ause a  lot  of J e ws  
lived there.  Th
e  Je ws  who  were  
in better fi nancial status, they--sl
owl y  the y move d out  to bett e r  pa
rts of the city.  But people who 
without means, like my fa
mily, we stayed in town
.  til l--a bout the downto
wn, you call it  downtown 
there; we stayed there until I was 
about nine years old an
d then we could move 
out.  My father, he 
wa s b orn i n 187 5.   His n a me wa
s He r ma n Rood a nd he was married 
t o my  mo ther .  M y mo ther  w a s

Sh e came later with her 
parents to the Netherla

English also.  They came to th
e Net herlands in Amst erdam beca

diamond fa mily.  Th ey wo rk

Diamonds, polishing, cu

grandfat her wa s in t hat work, di d

 I ha ven't  known my grandfat her  
because he died when I wa

grandmother  the sa me  thi ng.  They

 whe r e we  li ved  i n Ams t erd a m,  my
 mot h er wa s bor n in--I  tol d you 
wh en my father wa s born, 1875.  
M y mother  was  bor n 1881
.  So it wa s a  s i x-ye ar di ffe r ence .  The y  
got  mar r ied ,  my  mot her  wa s  thirt y  w hen  she  ma r r ie

my other  br other, M a chiel , t w o ye ars a fter  t hat  
and he was  bor n 12 Oct ober  1921.  The n  my mother  
took a pause.  In 1925 
our  baby sister  c a me. 
That was the most darling little girl
 that you ever can im
agine.  We were all 
very proud of her and 
her  birt hday wa s i n  Ma rc h, s hortl y 
after my mother's  bi rthday and sh
e was born 1925.  El izabeth, as 
I said, was t he most bea uti ful girl
 t h at you can i magine.  She ha
d four brothe rs who spoil ed her  
rotten but  she was not  spoiled.  I 
never--that  I have known her t ill I 
got  deported when
 I saw her for  
the l a st  ti me .   I  ca nn ot r e me mb er
 that  we-- where  you s a w her, you 
ha d a s mile .  Such a lovel y girl, 
she was.  She never  complained 
a b out  thi ngs t hat girls  do so
me time s, you know, especially 
adol escents.  I cannot  ever
 remember heari ng 
a complaint from he
r li ps .  Eve n a s I s ai d, when boys 
start  looki ng at  her  whe n  s he  was  
sixteen years old, 15, 
16 ye ars  ol d, a nd th

progres s--boys start  looki ng at her .  She ha d four  
brot hers  to l ook a ft er he

too long on her, believe
 me.  We were all ther
e watching it.  She was 
our baby, she 
was our little 
angel.  You will see her pi
cture, it will be enclosed.
 
 
 
Okay.  What  about  y
our -- wa s your fa t her of Ashke nazi  de sce nt ?
 
 
Ye s.  My  fa ther wa s wh at we c a

at doesn't me an t hat he ca me  
fr om Ge r ma ny.  They ca me  vi a Ger m any.
 
 
Do  you know when 
his fa mily ca me  to the Nether lands?
 
 
In t he sixt ee nth or  se vent eent h c ent ur y, the  na me 
was alr eady known.  I n t h
e beginning of the 16th 
cent ury, the  Net herla nds J e wis h populati on star
ted out about 1492 when
 Columbus sailed to 
Ameri ca.  About t he same
 ti me , Spanish and Port uguese  J ews  go
t t he  or de r tha t  t hey had t o lea ve 
the country if they did 
not  c onvert  to Christi ani ty.  They ha
d to leave the count
ry within three 
mont hs.  They for me d  a  communit
y in the Ne therlands, in Amsterdam which was ope n beca use the 
Net herlander s, t hat  was north Spai n t hen;  Spai n wa
s all  over  Eur ope.  The 
Netherla nders prot este d 
agai nst t he yoke of the Cat holi c 
Church.  The Cat holi c
 Church ha d a  hol d on
 t he state, on t he  
governme nt .   The Spani s h ki ng wa
s  wa x i n the hands of
 the Cat holi c Church
, t he Roma n Cat hol i c 
Church.  In the nort
h of the Netherlands, Belg
ium at  t hat  ti me was also
 the Netherlands, yeah? 
The y re volt e d, t hey ha d a revoluti on.  The y followe
d the doct rine or they 
followe d the example of 
Jonah Huss from ea ster n Eur ope and Martin Luther 
who pr ote sted agai nst t he Cat holic  Churc h.  The  
Netherlands followed that 
up.  The leader of the 
rebellion was a prince, a Sp
anish prince, but he was 
bor n i n t he  Net herla nds.  
He  wa s Spanis h prince  in t he  or der  of 
t he  royalt y, Spa nis h r oyalt y, but  he  
was also t he pr ince of the Net herl a
nds, also a prince of 
part of Germany, also 
a prince of part of 
France.  The name wa
s Orange and you have a part
 of France that is still
 called Orange and we call 
that fa mily--we still
 have that  family.  We ca
ll them by their la
st  na me , that  is  Ora nge .  Fr o m  

Orange, fr om France that is how th
ey are calle d.  Well , duri ng t hat re vol ution the r e wer e als o bi g 
pogroms  goi ng on i n t h
e east of Europe.   
 
 
Rig ht .
 
 
Poland, Russia, Ruma nia, Hu ngary. 
 Peopl e start  fl eeing t o the west
, Jews, away from the pogroms. 
They arrived by hundreds
 and later by thousands 
in the same city, Amster
da m.  But the Spanish 
Jews who had money,
 who were very educated, 
and were, many of them, 
fr om Spanish nobility. 
They formed a congr egation there and the Spanis
h had a  bi g synagogue , whi ch we ca lled a s hul  
whi c h  is  a  Ger ma n  or  Yid dis h  wor d for  s yna g ogu
e--school  that means--hou
se of learning.  The  
As hkena zi m  gre w a nd li ved in a shor
t while in certain amoun
t that they didn't need
 to search to pray 
with ten of them, 10
 or 12 people anymore.  Bu
t they had the means to build a church of themselves 
and t hey bui lt it  right  acr oss  fr om t he  Port uguese
, the Spani sh we call  Po
rt uguese  Syna gogue .  So  
now you ha ve  t wo big s yna gogues  a c
ross from each ot her.  The Ashk
enazi  gr ow so fa st  tha t  the y  
had to build another shul 
next to it.  So 
you have the Great Shul, this
 was in compe
tition with the 
Port ugues e, Spa nis h s hul .  The y call e d it, t he Ashk
enazi called themselves th
e Gre at Shul, a nd ne xt  
to it there came 
a not her  s hul  even bi gger t ha n t hat  and t h
at is called the Neie 
Sh ul,  th e  Ne w Sh ul.  
That  wa s t o o s ma ll.  They buil t  
especially fo r service 
through the week
, they built a smaller shul 
next  t o  it  a nd kept  mostl y  the  bi g s hul s  for  holiday
s, big holidays.  
They build a small weekly prayer  
shul next to it and that
 became, got the 
name of the Dritte S
hul.  The Dritte Shul 
that means the third  
shul.  They still have not room en
ough.  So they built a 
shul on top of the Dr
itte Shul and that 
beca me  the  Abovene  Shul, t he  s hul  ab
ove.  That  were t he official  name
s .   Ne xt  to it  t hey got  t heir  
own slaughterhouse so 
the Ashkenazi m communit y grows much
 fast er t han t he Port uguese 
communit y but t he Por t uguese comm
unit y al ways was the r ichest . 
 The  As hkena zi m has mostl y 
very poor  me mber s.  M y  fa
ther was one of t hese.  
 
 
Did he work in t he dia mo nd indust ry a lso?  
 
 
My father  was not  a diamond man. 
 My father  had,
 as as a small chil d, an
 accident .  He was about  
six year s ol d a nd that  c ost hi m a 
part of hi s foot.  His  he el  was 
mi ssi n g s o he wa s --his mot her 
thought he wa s not ready fo
r that.  Old time  children, six years 
old ha d t o wor k for a  livi ng.  The y  
were put in the fa mi ly labor forc e.  He was alread
y--he  had t o go out  alre ady a nd ma ke  a livi ng.  He 
liked nursery business, pl
ant s and fl owers and tr ees.  I n t he 
mi ddle of a city where t here was no 
gras s gr owing no more , you know, s o
 crowde d it  wa s with pe ople and 
houses .  But t h at 's what he 
did and that's wh at he 
grew up in.  Wh en I wa s a child, my
 father  was always in the nursery 
busi nes s.  I f you know t h e Dutc h cl
i mat e, t hat i s  not so good for 
a pe ddle r  bec a us e he  had to be a  
peddler  with a hand-pus h ca rt a nd peddl e his wa res 
ar ound t he house s, mostl y on t h e outs kirts  of 
town because there is where the 
people had little gardens and that
 is why he also
 could sell his 
merchandise.  The weather is rai ny,
 windy.  If the sun, it  is t oo hot
 so most of--at l east hal f of his  

mer cha ndise  c oul d not  be s old a n
y mo re by the end of
 t he  day beca use  it  was  r uined from t h e  
cli mate .   So he al ways barely scra pe d a li ving 
for his wi fe and si x chi l dr
en.  The str eet where w e  
lived was a very l ong str eet and 
t hat  wa s calle d t he  Rape nbur ger  St raat .  That 's  j ust  a  Dut ch na me . 
In the center of Amsterda
m this street was a little 
better than other slums around it.  Wh ere people 
lived in apar t ments, t hat means on
e room, barely any wi ndows and no 
sun there.  We had sun there, 
we  had a  kit che n, we  ha d one  r
oom with built in the 
walls, cabinet-like beds
.  You could open up 
the doors and there you had 
a kind of a bed there.  
That is what we
 ha d.  Furthe r mor e, when the  
fa mily grew, in the apartm
ent, we got some  beds se
t around the walls. 
 It wa s a big room, very light .  
In the back of the buil
di ng wa s a  home  for  the  older people  an
d they had a beauti
ful garden.  We  
lived, you c oul d s ay, i n the t op of
 the trees because we 
lived on the third floo
r and the trees just  
reached up t o our windows.  We had the doves and t he 
birds al ways in fr ont of t he window and  
beautiful flower s to look at in the mi ddle of the 
city.  We  were not that 
ba d off alt hough we wer e  
very, ver y poor  but t hat  you onl
y r ealized later  because
 everybody was poor. 
 So you didn't  know 
you wa s poor.  Ever ybody ha
d the same  struggle to ma
ke  ends  me et.  Al wa ys.
 
 
Ca n you te ll me  a bout t he  obse
r vance, the Jewish obser van
ce?  Did you keep kosher?
 
 
That  is what I just 
wanted to start with.
 
 
Oh, good, okay.
 
 
The street where I  lived, 
the Ra pe nburgerstr aat ha d se ve n s hul s. 
 The st reet  came 
out on the ma rket, 
on that square where we had the 
big shuls across 
from each other.  But then
 you also had the little--
what you cal l a ge vere  s h ul.  You unde
rsta nd that , gevere shul from Ga wwe r ?  
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
Chaverim.  If you have
 ten people together, th
ey could fo rm a keh
illa, a gemeinda and a 
communit y.  So we  ha d seve n of 
these i n  the st r eet and we have
 a se mi nary wh ere people were 
traine d to be  rabbi s.  We had acr o
ss fr om there a bi g shul where we 
went t o school wit h hundre ds of 
Je wish  chil d r en.   We  us e d t o  wor k  fo r t he  Heb r e w
 wor k___( 143)  for  a  Je wis h  
sc hool.  We  j ust  s ai d  
Jewish, the School of the Jews.  Th
at is how we called it
.  In fact  I sai d t h
ere we re hundreds of 
childr en when we were at  that sc
hool.  The e duc ati on at
 that school was not to
o much.  We  learned 
He bre w  but  we  neve r knew what 
we  were  s ayi ng.  We  didn't  lear
n too much of translation.  We  
were too young for that--alr
eady at nine yea rs old I move d t o the out skirt s.  As I ju
st said, we moved 
to a not her  part.  Tha t  is  how it  was  downt own 
for pe ople  t o s cra pe a li ving t oge the r  and wher e  

people  were  also watc hing out  for  e ac h other .   
If there was a family, they
 kne w they had no food, 
then they al wa ys  get  s o
mething from the neighbors.
 
 
But did you keep kosher?
 
 
My mother tried to; my father ha
d t o work on Sha bbos bec aus e on 
t he wee kend people  had mone y.  
That was his best day.  
My mot her  t r ied to kee p  kos her .   We  
called our selves the Je ws of the white 
Ha mout se ta blecl oth.  On Fri da y
 night , moutz e wa s ma de, kiddush
 was ma de and there wa s a white 
tablecl ot h on the  tabl e.  I f you 
didn't have mu ch food during the 
we ek, on Shabbos ther e  was  al ways  
somet hing to eat.  Shabbo
s was al ways  an e xtra t hi ng.  We ha
d a w on der ful fa mi ly-- my  mo ther  ha d  
sever al s i ster s and brot he rs a nd t h
e y hung t ogethe r  like  gl ue .  Sat urd
ay night, I reme mber, that we  
always  c a me  toget her  by one  of the  si
sters  or t he  brothe rs  in t h e house .
  Al l  the  br othe
rs with all the 
childr en and beli eve me, there were
 more than forty ch
ildren sometimes in the small houses.  We  
slept everywhere  be cause  it wa s too late for the ch
ildren to move out and th
e pare nts  wa nte d t o s i t  
around a little bit to tell
--to mind each other's business, you 
know, and to tell 
stories and sing  
together a little bit.  We call that
 shabbosmachen.  
Then the children, they sl
ept wherever  they could  
fi nd a place and by el even or  t w
el ve  o'cl oc k, e ver y pare nt  pi c ks  
up his own children
 and t hen we  
we nt  to our  own house, the  c hild
ren sleeping.  I reme mb er my fath
er  al ways t w o chil dren i n  hi s 
ar m, my mother had one , my ol dest brot her had 
one .  That is  how we we
nt to our own apartment 
whi ch was not-- we li ved a fe w bl oc ks from eac h 
other .  The dista nce was  
not ver y much.  But  it 
coul d be  t hat  there 's  a  s m all c hil d;  he  wa s pla ying in 
street ; t hat  was our  place t o
 pl ay, i n  the stre ets.  
The n sudde nly he was picked up by s o mebody 
and you heard t he voi ce,
 oh, Sh atsy, Shatsy, 
Liebling, you know.  They ar e the  
wonderfu l names that th
ey call small children;
 by my trea sur e, by 
my wonde r ful baby, you know.   The r
e you was i n the ar ms of
 an aunt or  an uncl
e.  They just  have 
to pi ck you up, they rec
ognize you, you was  on
e of the brothers' or sisters'
 c hildr en.  They ha ve t o  
hug you a  lit tle bi t a nd ki ss 
you a ll over.   You sit  do
wn wet from that  and then
 they al ways  gi ve you  
a penny or they give you a piece
 of candy.  Yeah, we 
were--the families were
 wonderful together, 
wo nd er ful .  
 
 
That 's  ni ce, i t  sounds-- .  
 
 
If I can, if I fi nd a way to do it 
tomorrow morning, 
I will make a little statis
tic, how ma ny brothers 
and si ster s my father an
d mother  ha d; how ma ny chil dre n al
l have together and how ma ny ca me  
back after the war.
 
 
Oh , t hat  will --.
 
 

I will try to make a 
statistic to morrow mo
rning and enclose it.
 
 
That  will  be  great .
 
 
But it will be
 handwritten.
 
 
That 's  fi ne.
 
 
Because I hate to 
use the typewriter.
 
 
Me too.  
 
 
I'm a one-fi nger typewriter ma n.
 
 
No  problem.
 
 
So whe n we  were  ni ne years ol d--,
 when I was--.  We  
went  to shul, the shul
 wa s suc h that, I  sa y 
shul , I me an the  r eligi ous s chool , t he  Je wi sh sc hool. 
 I t  wa s such:  i n t he  mo
rning, 7:30 I 
had to go 
to one of the seven little s
huls in the street where 
we lived and say my morn
ing prayers.  I was not 
yet 13 years old so I did not wear
 a tallis but I wear, I had to we
ar a arbcanfo us.  You know what 
that is?
 
 
Yes, tzitziot. 
 
 
Yeah.  I us ed to wear th
at, my brot hers a nd me, we  all did.  
My mother used to 
knit them together 
and a  neighbor  who know e xact ly 
how to knit the tzitzis we calle
d them, he know
 and he ma de 
them on the corners.  We  ha d to
 wea r  the m under our cl othe s. 
 But I remember that we never 
showed t hem.  We put  the t zitzi i n t he cl ot hes that
 you can see al ways a pi
ctur e, you see of Jews , 
tzitzi are hanging out.  No, we didn'
t have such a thing.  We  used 
to--well, the law said, the Jewish 
law sai d you have to wea r  the m visi bl e.  No, we di
dn't do, we just put t he m 
in our pants.  Then at 
the school, they also took care--v
ery several charity of 
these people, also or
ganized charities that 
we , the poor  kids , got
 by Chanuka h, t hat 
we got s o me n e w clo t hes .  Ou
r whole school, all the boys  
wearing the sa me  sweater.  Because that was bou
ght  en masse and handed out  to the children.  And 

the same shoes, the same ki nd of stockings, the sa
me cap.  Then that  became uni for m in t he ti me  
that I reme mbered. 
 
 
So  you attended--?
 
 
(Interjects) Excuse me .  In the morn
ing, we did our mor ning pr ayers , th
at was about thirty  minutes .  
The n  I went  home  I  got  my brea kf
ast from Mother 
and by nine o'clock I had to
 be at t h e el ement ary 
school , publ ic.  That  wa s the go
vernme nt school.  Yo u know wh
ere you had to--the deal was--
nobody coul d get  a wa y fr om that . 
 You ha d to be at  sc hool  and 
ge t your educati on, your  Dutc h 
education.  By  12 o'clock we  were
 out and we  were expected to be, 
by 1 o'cl oc k bac k, in the  J e wis h 
school.  So we 
had time fr om 12
 to 1 to eat, go back 
to eat, ______. Until about a quarter to two ,  
we got our Hebrew le
ssons and then rush up to
 the elementary school ba
ck till 4:30.  Five o'clock, 
Je wish sc hool again.  Si x o'cloc
k or 6:30, t hey le t us
 go a nd we could go home
 where  we got a bit e  
to e at a nd I had t o be  for  my nigh
t prayers, we call it xlay
me n ,  wh at we  s a id , o k
ay.  At  eight o'clock 
we  had to be  ba ck at  shul  an
d by nine  o'cl oc k I  ca me  home  a n
d you didn't  know no more the whol e  
day beca use  ever ythi ng fl ooded t o eac h 
other.  The n by nine  o'c lock we  
wer e bac k i n  be d.  That  is  i n  
that part of t he cit y.  Then wh
en we  move d t o t he outs kirts of 
town because the houses were so 
dilapi dat ed whi l e we lived downtown
 that t hey r azed that par t of 
t he town.  They 
razed it and built  
new houses.  The cit y, the 
governme nt city, the city governme nt 
found us ne w place s 
t o live.  That  
was on the outskirt of 
town.  Also was a 
little Jewish congregation, I 
right away became a member 
of.  We  lived there for th
ree years on the outskirt 
of town where we played
, jus t  like downt o wn, we  
played in t he street .  We 
fought  wi th t he non-Je wi sh c hil dren l i ke
 you have  to.  That
 di dn't fi ght  us  
because t hey wer e  anti sem
ite.  No, we we re not of 
their religion so they had 
to fi ght us and we  had 
to fight  them because t hey wer e  
not of our religion.  
Sunday mo rning, we ha
d also some  Hebrew 
school .  In order  not t o di sturb t h
e citi zens who wanted to
 go to churc h, we coul d not  pl ay i n rece ss  
out  in t he  str eet.  We  ha
d to go up the roof of 
the  sc hool.  It  wa s a hi gh
 building and a big fe nce  
around the roof and we 
had to play there till rece
ss was over.  The 
few people--I 
was not the nicest 
kid--we wanted to play tricks 
on people, you know, lik
e young people do, all 
kind of little, mean 
things.  So as soon as 
we were up on our way t o t h
e r oof, for r ecess, we sli
pped out wit h five or  si x 
boys fr om the sa me  cl
ass and we went  to a school  t hat was j u
st  around the c orner ; a  Sunday School  
for t he Catholic pe ople .  The Be the s da school , t h ey
 c alle d it .  That 's wher e we got  a  c ookie, that 's  
why we went there, for the cookie.
  Th ey k ne w we wer e
 comi ng and the y ha d a fe w chai r s rea dy for  
us and we at e the cookie and t hen 
they let us go, real fast .  Then 
we we nt  to another  s t reet a bout  
three  bl oc ks far t her  a nd t here  was  a Salvati on Ar my
 Su nd
ay Sch oo l   T hat  
was muc h nicer beca use 
they played music there, the trumpet and the dr ums 
and we li stened there an
d then we got a cup of 
chocolat e.  So we  got  a  c hoc olate  a nd we  got  a  
cookie  a nd t he y l et us  go
 because everybody kne w 
that the Jewish children had to be back at recess on time.  Then we went up to the roof just in time 
to ma ke  it ba ck i n clas s.
 
 
Oh  my .  
 

 
Yea h, t hat  i s how we  s pend our 
Sunda y, our  Sunday mo
rnings .  Li ke  I sai d, I  le a rned, I start 
learni ng Hebrew whe n I wa s thr ee ye ars ol d, I ha d to
 go alrea dy.  That wa s nor mal a nd I wa s a bout  
13 years  ol d when I ha d my 
Bar Mit z vah; we live d alre
a dy in the ot her par t of
 the town ag
ai n.  So I 
had about nine or ten year
s of Hebrew education.  
Wh en I was through with 
it, I still didn't know 
anyt hing.  I had a wonde rful Bar  Mit zva h--at t hat  ti
me we lived al so in a not her part of the t own.  
There were also governme nt hous
es , you would call  it  here  pr oje c
ts;  were for po
or people who 
coul dn't pa y the  nor mal  rent.  We  lived t her e a n
d then when I was 13 ye
ar s ol d and I  did my Ba r  
Mitzva h i n t he neighbor hood where  
we  just came  from, that was 
t he I ndie s (262) quart er.  We  
called it t he Indies quart e r because all  the street s 
t here had names of
 the Netherl ands I n dies.  Wher e 
we lived, now that wa
s what you call  t he South Af
r ican quarters, the Transv
aalbuurt quart er because 
that 's where  all t he stree t s  ha ve  na mes  fr om Sout h Af
rica.  Because they live 
so ma ny Dutc
h there.  I 
went  back to the I ndies quarter  
t o do my Bar Mitz vah.  Ri ght  aft e
r that I quit the 
whol e t hing an d 
became a member  of a Social De
mocrati c Yout h orga nizat i on.  I  
will  enclose a picture i n t her e 
where you see me 
about that age.
 
 
Oh, okay.  
 
 
Yea h ,  wh en we  were  me mb ers  o f  
tha t  or gani zati o n.  This  was - o-you ca n c o mpar e t hat if you ha ve  

ever  heard, wit h t h
e Bund in Poland.  
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
You ha ve he ard of that?
 
 
Ye s, of cour se.
 
 
We ll, our  or gani zation was s o met hing 
like that but we were not strict
ly Jewi sh, that wa s not in the 
Netherlands.  In the Ne
therlands, I don't know 
i f  you know t hat, but t he big or gani ze d move me nt  
started about out in the Netherla
nds and we  had severa
l Je wish lea ders who 
really built a labor 
move me nt  in the  Net herla nds , bette r t h an 
i n Ger ma ny or  in Fr
ance or i n Bel g ium.
 
 
No, I didn't  - -.
 
 

We  had a very strong Social De
moc ratic move ment and whe n I  be
came an adolescent later  on, I 
went to--I tel l you my stor
y there i n a mi nute from the school .  
In my adolescence, we fought on th e 
one  s i de  t he  c o mmunist s  a nd on t he  other  side , we  
fought the fascists, but 
that  was already in t h e 
thirties, I guess.  I was eleven y
ears old when I  finished el ementary
 sc hool.  My ol dest  brot her wa s  
sure he was already t hrough with sc
hool and he l earne d ho
w to be a baker.  My sister had to be a 
sea mstr ess.  Whe n I ca me from sc ho
ol, t he  pri nci pal t old my fat her  th
a t I had to go 
to a sc hool for  
higher l ear ni ng.  I n t he  hi gher  lear
ni ng, my father didn't  se
e too much of a futur e
 in that because the 
De pres sio n wa s o n th at t i me .  
Re me mber, I was bor n 191
7, 1929 the  Depressi on 
started.  So by the 
time  I was out of school people
 started roaming the st
reets for work and fo
r food.  All ove r the  
world.  It wa s ver y bad in
 we ster n Eur ope t oo.  My father  di dn't
 wa nt me  to roa m st reet; he though t  
if you go to higher s chool, you 
don't l earn a  trade and onl y wit h a 
trade you can make
 a living.  So I 
had to learn to ma ke a li
ving and I went to a trad
e school.  I wa s close to 
fourte en ye ars  ol d, I  wa s  
still 13 years old, when
 I fi nished that trade school
 but it fo rced me 
to learn--to be a 
pastry maker.  I 
wa nte d to be  a  t ool  and die ma ke
r, I liked that  very much, to build machine  and machine part s but 
they told me  that I was 
better to be  a pastry maker.  I became 
a pastry maker and af
ter I came  out of 
school , t hey took c are t ha t I had 
a job in a pl ace.  That  was a plac
e where  I got  ver y sick bec ause I  
coul dn't  sta n d--I  coul dn't  handle
 t he at mospher e, the cl i mate i n  a 
bakery, hot, dusty, stinking, dirty, 
terrible ,  al ways  floating dust .   Th
e ai r was al ways thi ck from t he 
flour and the sugar  a n d t he  ba king 
fr om the oven.  I got very sick an
d aft er about  a year, my fat her  took
 me out  there .  M y mo ther  sai d  
let him go back to school 
now.  You know what  t he  pri nci pal  sai
d, he  nee ds  to be  i n  e duc ation, i n  
higher  lear ni ng.  M y father s aid no
, he's  going to be a ta
ilor.  Everybody needs a 
patc h in his  pants .  
By t hen it  was 1931, about,
 and I bec a me a  tai l or .  I 
cried my heart out  but  i t 
di dn't hel p;  I ha d t o be 
a tailor which I still am.  
 
 
Oh  my  goodness.
 
 
I 'm i n  the  t ai l oring bec ause I  have 
a very-- my abili ty t o  lear n i s  pr e
tty good--and sinc
e  I  had t o be  a  
best  tailor--i f I had t o  be a tail or, I 
wanted to be t he best  
t hat  t here was.  I stud
ied hard and later on I  
beca me  a master  tail or  whi ch is  a  high de gree
.  Then I  got my bus ine
ss diploma  but  that was  
aft e r war ds.
 
 
But it--.
 
 
In 1939 I started out for myself. 
 All this time from 
1931 till about 193
7, I was an apprentice.  I n  
1937, I had to go for the military 
draft but my brother--it was stil
l Depression--my br
other at that 
time  planned to go to Sp ain to 
fight in the International Brigade against Spanish;  there was a ci vil 
war  goi ng on.  He wa nte d to fi ght
 against Franco, the fascist .  Th
e r e was s o me pr obl e ms , he ne ver  
had wor k, my brot her , so I was  pr
actically the breadwinne
r  in  the fa mil y.   I  di dn 't mak e  mu ch  b ut  I  

wa s the breadwi nner so I got a y
ear's  suspension from--I don't kno
w how you call th
at, suspension, 
a year later I needed to co
me into the dr
aft, military.
 
 
De fer men t.
 
 
De fer ment, oka y.  I  don'
t  even know t hat word.
 
 
No w you do.
 
 
Now I know.  In 1938, it 
was my turn to be--to go 
back into the military but then I 
decided instead  
of going to be back in the military,
 I wanted to take an extra servic
e, a special servic
e.  That means 
you stay civilian, but al
ways ready to be called 
in and do your 
duty as a mi
litary.  Meanwhile yo u 
can go on in your civilian 
duty as long as it is soci
al work, you know, doing--.
  I wanted to do that  
anyway so  I be came  a nurse in the Jewi sh  Invali
d which wa s  a hospit al by t hat  na me .  The onl y 
hos pital in the whole worl d that  we  know, that  took 
c are , t hat  t ook people  from t he  str ee t , out  of t he  
gutters, homeless people 
as long as they were Jewish and ga
ve the m a home.  
Paralyzed people, 
de me nted pe ople , me nt al ly ill  people;  the y  all  found 
a ho me i n t hat  par tic ular  hous e.  It was  a  bi g 
hospital right in the center 
of Amster dam and I  
became a nur se t here.  One 
of the nurses there, the 
most beautiful one, she b
ecame my wife .  She pushed me out afte
r about a little over a year and she  
said i f you wa nt t o get e ver ma rri
e d wit h me , t he n you better ma ke  a li ving a s a  tail or beca use  here  
you don't make a penny.  In
 the hospital, they work
 for just board 
a nd r oom a nd si nce  we  c oul dn't  
get a  room; t he mal e nurs es c oul dn't
 get a room in the hos
pital , there were t he 
fe ma le nurses .  Tha t  
is the t hi ng, why s hould you, you 
could not sle ep i n the  sa me  hous e,
 you c o uld not li ve i n the  sa me  
house .  The  fe ma le  nurs e s had a pl
ace to sleep, t hey all  had thei r 
rooms but the men 
you had to find 
the m out side and for t h at you got five guil der s a 
mo nth to pay.  And they
 would s end the  five  
guil ders t o my mot her becau
se I sl ept at the house. 
 But I ate, always came 
fr om the hospital where I 
lived. Then I we nt away from the ho
s p ital.  My older br othe r took my 
pl ace;  he fi nall y got a j ob t hat  
way and I went back in the tail
oring business.  Right 
after that, the mobiliz
ation started because 
Ger ma n y made noi ses a nd you know it attac ke d Po
la nd i n '39.  The Ne ther
la nds sta rt mobil izing 
and I thought that  since I  am a t a
ilor and most of the pe
ople in the private ma
rket, they started to 
work in the  blac k ma rket  be
cause a  lot of things-- imports were fo
r bidde n.  A l ot  of thi n gs ha d t o be  
done for the governme nt .   I de cided 
I go to the military warehouse and 
a ppl y to be a tail or there .  I  
coul d better  work t her e, you unders
ta nd.  That s o me body you get to
gether  ha d no me a ns t o prepare  
to compare with wh at 
you could ma ke on t he bl ack ma rke t  
but I  was ne ver a  bla c k mar ket  man  
anywa y.  I  t hought  that  I  will  do
 my  duty for the country and I will
 help with the mobilization and 
ma ke uni for ms  as  fast  as  I ca n.  By t h at ti me , I be
came a cutt er in the war e
hous e a nd wit hin a wee k  
that I was there I got my
 draft notice because I 
was still in special mi
litary, you know, civilian 
military.  I went tomy major, the manager of th
e warehouse and I said I have
 to go and report to my 
detail  in Utr echt i n another cit y.  He said what are 
you going t o  do the re?  I s a
id well , as I  see her e, I  

am goi ng in air force.  That means we have t o  sh
oot airplanes down
 from the ground
.  How you call  
the m, t he gr ound s ervi ce , y
ou know.  But it was part of t he air  forc
e.  As I see here.  He says what  
do you know about it. 
 I  s ays  not hing, I  neve r ser ved.  It  is  t he  
first thing I get about it.  So he called  
the commander in Utrecht, the othe
r city, and he said I have a ta
ilor here who is 
a good tailor and 
knows more  about  tail ori ng t ha n 
he knows  about  shooting pla nes do
wn.  I  kee p hi m 
here and let's 
change services and 
make hi m a military here. 
 I became a civ
ilian military in mi
litary service in 
Amsterdam in the m
ilitary warehouses wh
ere I was a cutter 
and we cut uniformsas fast as we 
coul d, t hous ands a da y.  The y  we
re sent out to sweats
hops where they made 
the uni f or ms  s o t he  
military could get dressed.  The sa
me way weapons were made, we we
re part of that complex .  
When t he war st arted, May 
10, I  wa s in t he  ni ght  s hi ft bec a us e we
 worked two shifts, three shifts in 
24 hours. Early in
 the mo rning, it start dawnin
g a little bit, light 
enough, four o'cloc
k in the night, it 
start getting away, light en
ough.  We  saw the 
Ger ma ns  plan es  c o min g  o ve r ; we  we re  a l so  a  tar get  
because we were military warehouses
.  I was trained already, a fe w 
months before, as the head, the  
comma nde r of one  of the  air r aid 
shel ters, we ha d four  air raid sh
elters, 350 person
s could sleep in 
an air r aid shelter and I  
was t he commander of one .  I  ha d t o sta y
 t here  for  the ei ght  hour s  ser vice  as  
tailor and then eight hours 
service as an air raid sh
elter man.  I s
till had eight hours 
left  in the 24 
hours and I  r epor ed for  t h
e city and beca
me  an ambulance man for the,
 what you call the National 
Guard.  I  became part  of
 the  Nati onal Guard.  
Because I had the traini ng 
as a male nurse so t hey 
coul d use me in the ambu
lance.  My mother  neve
r knew in this fi ve da
y s ' war  t hat  we  had ,  was  
wh ere she could me  bring 
me  food bec ause  nobody 
had fo od for you.  We  ju
st we nt  fro m  one  pl ace  
to the other to do our duties and 
my mother  just  had t o fi nd out , 
si nce one of my br other s had a 
bicycle, find out where Rood i s a
nd bring hi m hi s lunch, or bring 
hi m hi s  dinner, or bring hi m hi s 
breakfast .  That i s how we went
 though the war and then the war 
was over  and ever
ybody was very 
distra ught  a bout it  t hat  the  Ger m
ans won.   Lots of Jewish peop
le, especially promi nent  Jewish  
people, killed themselves.  
We  had a big contingent 
of German refugees, Jewi
sh, in the Netherlands.  
They knew what was comi ng.  We  
heard a lot  before.  When I  wor ked
 as a male nurse in the Jewi sh  
hos pital , t ha t  was  on a sq
uare in the middle of th
e  J e wis h neighborhood i n Ams t er da m.  Ver y  
moder n hos pital, very moder n, beau
tiful building, grass al
l over.  Across fr
om 
that hospital, there 
was a hot el, in the mi ddl e 
of town, Hotel Rotterdam 
was it s na me .  The l ea der
s of the hospital put 
me in the night shift beca
use they figured I 
was politically motivated for th
e following j
obs.  In the 
Hot el Rotter dam, acr oss the street , Ger man refug
ees who came over the 
bor der wit hout pass por ts,  
wit hout cl ot hes  many ti me s, were  c hase d out  of 
Ger ma n y, fl ed out  of Ge
rmany, manytime s broke, 
desperat e at the bor ders and chas
ed into the Netherlands while th
e st ate poli ce was waiti ng t o sen d  
the m ba ck t o Ger ma n y beca use  t he y had no pa pers
, t he y had no not hi ng. 
 So the y had t o be  
smuggled into the Netherlands.  Already a fe w ye
a r s be fore, es peciall y  si nc e 1938, Kri s tallnac ht , I  
wa s part  of t he--a  me mb er of a  gr oup t hat  ca ught
 people that  came over  
t he  borde r and s muggle d  
them farther in to
 Amsterdam where there was shelter ava
ilabl e for t hem.  Th
e Jewish community 
took care of them. It was 
for bidden so we wer e  always chased 
by the state police. 
 In the Je wish 
hos pital ,  the y know my bac kgr ound. 
 They put me in the ni ght shift in or der to catch the pe ople, to 
receive t he peopl e whi ch Hot el Rotter dam sent  over 
to our hospital.  It  wa
s such, Hotel Rot terdam 
that they harbored illegal 
German refugee Jews
.  The police, once 
in a while, raided 
that hospital.  
When they catch these pe ople, they put them in pr
ison and dr ag them back to Germany where they 
would be  ki lled.  Ther e  wa s al so i n the police
--we  ha d s o me  good he l
p.  They warned Hotel 

Rot terdam i n advance that there 
was a raid coming; that the polic
e would come and catch whatever  
they had in the house, that were
 not  l egal .  The  Hote
l Rotterdam right away 
c alle d a cross t he  stre et  
to the Je wish hospital and said 
open your doors, fi
ve  men are c o ming ove
r, ten me n are coming 
over , t w o men ar e c o mi ng ove r, whatever  he  ha d in t h
e house.  I rushed, I got the cal ls and t hat i s  
why I  was pl aced i n  the night  shi ft ,  
I  got  the calls, r ushed do
wnstairs to t he back 
entrance.  It  was i n  
the middle alleyway dow
n to the street, open the fe
nce doors, the gates, we 
had a little gate there.  I  
had t he ke ys , opened t he  doors a nd t hen I  sa w t h
ese people dresse d in a bedshe et, wi thout s hoe s 
many times, some of them
 are dressed.  They
 start running 
over, there were little 
grass fields on the 
square, running over the  
gras s fiel ds , I had the door ope n, got 
them in there, put them in the 
elevat or , upstairs and put  them 
in the beds between th
e other patients.  Ma
ny times we  had the 
police checking because there was a 
sus pici on t h at we s muggled patie
nts into the c
ountry--that is 
refugees into the country. 
 The n we gave  the se pe ople  ma ny ti me
s, ve ry hot c o ffe e or very hot tea  
and then they blowed up.  
We said dri nk, dri nk, dr
ink, and they look like th
e y ha ve a fe ver and t hen 
the patr ol ca me , you know, and t h
e y chec k t he be ds i n the wa rds 
and in the rooms where we had 
these people hidden 
and they saw them laying.  We told them
, we looked 
at t he so-called police and  
said, hi gh fe ver, oh, 
boy, nah, t his i s cont agi ous .  The n t hey 
went bac k.  That ki nd of tri cks we  ha ve  
to pla y t o sa ve the  peopl e
 life .  As a matter
 of fact, the me n that came la
ter , my br other - in-la w  ca me  
into the country that wa
y, a German Jew.  In on
e of the statements, I th
ink he will be na med in 
there.  Julius Stern, he married my
 si s t er-in-l a w, my wi fe 's  younge st
 sister .  He wa s a  Ger man Je w .  
later on he opened a busi ness .  
He  wa s a  b utch e r,  wh at t he y c a

underst and t hat? 
 
 
No .  
 
 
Salami - maker.  He was a ma
ster in it like I was a ma
ster in my trade, he wa
s a maste r  in t hat .  He  
opened his business and did 
very well till he got de
ported.  German Jews got
 deported first.  But  
anyway, --
 
 
Is this-- , is  your  wi fe
's sister, Ur sul a Stern?
 
 
No, no.  The y ar e not  rela ted.
 
 
The y 're not .
 
 
You are  talki ng about  Urs ula
 who was in show befo re?
 
 

Ye s.
 
 
No, no.  I  do not know about t h
at  l ady be cause  I thi nk she  we nt

We inberg-- what i s her name--
 
 
Yeah, Selma Engle, right. 
 
 
Engle, Yeah We inberg.  Onl y from her I 
know; I spoke with he
r several times.  
 
 
Oh, okay.  
 
 
Anywa y let 's  go bac k to 1940.  Th
e war was over in five days, not 
beca us e the Dutc h coul dn't fi ght  
but the Netherlands is not a 
country where you can fight.
 
 
I ha ve  to st op you beca us e I ha ve
 to fl ip the tape  over.  Okay?
 
 
Okay.  ( E nd of Side  A).. . 
.   by the wa rehouse .  A l ot of Je wi sh
 tailors, we had lots
 of Jewish tailors 
in Amsterda m and also  diamond work
ers, but the tailors th
at  wer e worki ng, we  went  t o our wor k. 
We were cl osed out.  Th
e Jews were closed out,
 onl y t he non-Je ws could come to wor k.  But  we 
have to r eport two ti me s a da y, ever y ti me  on a di ff
er ent l oc ati on.  We ha d to
 put, t her e was a st amp 
to plac e on our c ard, t hat  we  re
port ed for work.  We were not  al lo
wed to work because t he Ger man s 
did not  wa nt any Je ws  in t hat plac
e of work.  That 
we nt for a  while.  We  got  our  sa lary paid bec aus e  
we were still Dutch 
employed, we never got
 fired.  We  just wanted to
 work.  Then 
came the time  
that I wanted to get married a
nd we shoul d get  mar r ied Se pte mber 
the  fir st, t he 4t h, t he 4t h.  
September 4, my  father wa s very si
ck by that ti me, the year before 
he wa s already in 
the hospital, he 
had a ba d heart a nd st oma ch ail me n t.
  The doct or s aid you can kee p 
the diet and live for, I don't  
know how l ong, but you ca n eat all yo
u want  a nd I gi ve  you just one  y
ear  t o li ve.  My father  sai d, I  
have so little to eat in my life , 
I can eat all I want.  A year late
r, he died.  No
w September 4, we 
should get married.  My father 
wa s  very sic k the night be for e.  
Ther e was cur f ew' by eight o'clock  
you had to be int o your hous e. 
 M y wi fe- t o- be and me , we  had an
 a part me nt  fixe d.  ______( 16) , you 
didn't  live off your  pare nt s.   As  soon a s you c ould,
 you l et your  pare nts  live 
off you.  You t ook care  
that money came into the 
hous e s o t hat e ver ybody ha d a  bit e to
 eat .  Al so an apar t ment, a goo d  
apartment, yours!  We  put furniture in ther e, we  
put  food in t he  ca binet, put
 your  be ds  up there .  
Yo u know, ma ke an 
apartment living, able to live in.  You did it all yoursel f.  You sa ved your  
mone y for  that.  So 
we  saved our money for two 
years  in or der  to have a 
house of our own, a decent  
apartment.  The last rent  (22) we  put on the apar
t me nt, it  was  now about  s e
ve n o'cl oc k at night  and 

we  were  wai ting  for  my  fat her  a n
d mother to come and 
look at our apart men
t and say ah and oh, 
you know, li ke  par ent s ar e s upposed 
to say.  It became seven o'clock, 
my wi fe  had t o  be  bac k i n  th e  
hospital where she still worked
 as a nurse and it was cu
rfew, she couldn't  be on the str

to the hospital but it
 was not too far.  You had to
 do everyt hing r eal  runni ng
.  I we nt to 
the hospital 
and then I  went strai ght  home from th
e center  t o t h e east part  of the 
town and I just made it at eight

  There I saw my father 
laying down and covered 
wit h blac k bl ood.  Whe n  we

had a, how you ca ll t hat , a  ruptur e, a  stoma ch er

I we nt to t he be d of my fa

I had to go to my

hospital to tell her that the weddin

The  or der c a me that  gat h erings were  not a llowe d no

t he  pr oce ssi on ha d to go

 you know what  tha t  is?   And  
chewre kadusja? 
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
Yeah, okay.  They came to our ho
use  and took ca re of eve ryt hing.  
They coffined my
 father.  I was 
the onl y, at t hat ti me, I was t he 
onl y one who ha d a talli s beca use yo
u  re me mb er my  pas t , I w a s ver y  
orthodox, my past.  We to
re the tallis, you cannot put a good ta
llis into--with a co

destroy it partly.  So we
 tore the tallis up
 and we  buried it 
with my father.  
My father, it was 
forbi dden to ha ve  be hi nd t he  he arse  mor e t han 
one  a utomo bile.  It was  for bidde n because more  
automobi les  would be  a  de monstr a
tion.  The  people fr om e ver ywher e
 know that this was a fu neral 
that  could not have a pr ocessi
on.  People came fr om everywhere
 and wa lked on 
the sidewalks up 
wit h the hearse.  The hearse i n 
t he mi ddle , we , the fa m
ily in the automobile 
and then on the sides 
wer e pe ople wal king.  Th
e few str eets and then we have t o 
s p eed up and go t o th
e cemet ery.  My 
wi fe  a nd me , we  had to get marrie d beca use  we  have
 an apar t ment.  I f you
 have an apartment in 
thos e days, e very thing was very s us p
icious.  Th ose days you wa sn't tr

apart me nt  a nd I di dn't  move  int o it
, I coul d be arrested.  They arre
st ed you first an
d then ask l et 's 

fi nd out what you did.  
Yo u wa s arr e sted  first .  We  k no w 
a l ready by e x perie nce , once you we re 
arrested by Ger man SS and t he Nazi
s, it  was ver y har d to get  out  in
 one piece.  A week l ater  we got 
mar r ied for t he cit y, my wi fe and 
me .  The n we coul d move in our 
apartment.  We didn't but we  
made it as somebody lived there, it
 l ooked like.  then a 
week aft er t hat , t h e 18
th, we got, what we 
called our c huppa h, you know, fo
r t he Je wi sh c o mmun
ity.  Sa me t hi ng, no de monst r ations, no 
gatherings.  In t he st reet  where I  
lived as a child, that lo
ng, l ong street  with 
t he  s eve n s hul s, there  
was t he seminary as I  tol d you al re
a d y a nd both of ne xt  door  wa s 
t he ce nt ral ra bbi nat e .  The  he ad 
rabbi  ha d his  office  i n  the  house  wh
er e t he shul  was.  That 's where 
we  got married.  The shul, itself,  
didn't  held t oo ma ny pe ople .   I  th
ink two hundred people 
c o uld go i n  tha t s hul .  That  wa s  not  too 
ma ny for wh at you were 
use d t o in the ol d c ountr y.  The y ope
ned the  windows wi de be caus e people  
gathered i n  the streets, not  fo
r our  we ddi ng but  for  t he  de monst r

occ upier s, you know, and they over 
i n the street  t o be part of our
 wedding.  Th e 
whole  wedding wa s  
broa dca ste d out  of thi s window.  We
 didn't  ha ve  micr ophone s  or  ra dio,
 broadca sted out  in t he stre et. 
My fa ther 's  funer a l a nd our we ddi ng wa s the firs t  pu
blic demonstrations agai
nst the Germans.  We  
defied the Germans. 
 That is how we got  marr
ied i n 1940.  The next  mo
rni n g I had t o
 go--remember 
we had to report to the warehous
e that we were still th
ere, we had to get 
a stamp on our card; 
other wi se i f you re fuse  t o go t o wor k , you could 
be ar rested.  Somewher e el
se you would be fired. 
No, they-- whatever  reason they c
ould find, you wo uld be 
arrested.  We  went th
ere and we  found out 
that we are fi red, all the Jews we
re fir ed so t hat  was a 
ver y plea sant  no- wor k. 
 Th e same day I found 
very sarca sti c no, no, sar castic  i s not  the  wor d, ir on
ical , very ironical.  I found work for a place  that  
took old suits and turn
e d  the m i nsi de  out.  Ma de  ne w suit s wi
th the inside out. 
 That  peopl e, that  
was a comp any that also 
cleaned clothes for 
citizens, normal cleaning, dr y-cleaning but 
also had a 
lot of work for t he German
 a r my .  T hey  p ut me  t o 
work.  I got to work in 
a  busi nes s that li ve d off 
the Ge r mans  and I  ha d t o  put  s uits  
ins i de out , you know, t he  inside  ou
t.  I made so 
good mo ney that  
ti me  tha t  I c oul d have-- I wa s out of the hous e, I  
could t ake  care  of my mo
t h er, a  widow by t he n an d 
she had a stroke by then, 
too and my little sister an
d my younger 
brother.  I could hi
re a fe w people . 
My second brother, Jona
s, was still POW by the Ge
rmans but if they
 could get work, if they had 
guarantee of signed decl aration that
 they coul d fi nd wor
k, t hey coul d go i n the 
cit y of--societ y; they 
let them go.  I sign
ed t he papers  and I got  my 
br other Yonas  work so a lot  
of pe opl e got  work in my  
little business which I was very prou
d of.  That went on 
till I was deported, till I 
had to report myself 
for a
 la bor  c a mp whic h I  sent  you als o  pict ure s of.
 
 
Oh, gre at.
 
 
With, you wi ll see me .  I will cros
s, you know, ma rk the 
one who I am when I se
nd you the  pi ctur es.  
That's  about it.  The 1930's, the 
de pr ession years, I  wa s 
a me mber of the Social  De mo cratic Youth 
Or ganization which, by the wa y, this y
ear, in September, in the Netherla
nds, we  will  ha
ve a reunion.  
We  ar e all  i n our  se vent ies a nd ei ghties t he n.  At
 that time, 
we  were  very young peopl e, ver y  
de monstr ative, ve ry hard, ac tive  
in the Spanish Civil War, fighti
ng against the Ge
r ma n y, we  had  
Nazis in the Netherlands 
too, fighting against the 
Ger ma n  infl uence, fi ghti n
g against the Na zis, and 
on the l e ft si de, fi ghti ng agai nst  
the communists on
 t he  ot her  si de.  The  Soc i al De mocr at s wer e ri ght 

in the mi ddl e.  I  was alr eady, when
 I was 15 ye ars old, I sta yed ou
t all  night .  Fat her  and M othe r  
didn't even know that I wa
s not in bed.  I snuck out of the 
house wit h my ol de
r  br other  a nd w e  
painted and we put on po
sters on walls, you k
now, and put fl iers 
up.  All political wo
rk, that's what 
we  di d.  I  got a ver y pol itical  but 
als o a  ver y cult ural  educa tion i n
 that  youth organiz ati on be ca use  
they t hought  poor  chil dr en who 
bar ely got  an educa
tion;  we  have a  dut y 
t o  educate the poor 
children.  I wa s one of th
e m, got  a  good e duc ati on i n that  or ga
ni zation.  We lear ned a l ot  about  
wo rld history, nature, edu
cation that  you woul d get in the lower 
classes at  the colle
ge, at the college, 
yes .  That  is the kind of e duc ation we  got .
 
 
Ca n I ask you--your  or ga nizati on it was cal led the  Soc i
al De mo cratic Yout h or di d it  ha ve a s peci fic 
--?
 
 
No, our or ganizati on di d not have t he na me Social 
Democratic in it 
alt hough we were.  We we re 
called AJC.  Just lik
e here in A merican
 Jewish Congress?
 
 
Ye s.
 
 
The same initials.  I am 
a member again of the AJ
C.  The Dutch name is 
Arbeid Jeugd Centrale. 
That  me an s Lab or  Yo uth  Cent ral.   Th
at was international, 
t hat  orga niza tion.  I know a cl oser  pi ctur e  
when I  a m very young i n t hat  
orga ni zation, a bout  13 ye ars  ol d, 
13 or 14 years old, I will have a  
picture in there that we are of a 
little group.  That 
will be that.  
 
 
Gre at.
 
 
In that orga nizati on, a s I sai d, 
we got a ver y cul t ural educati on.
  The y  sa w i n  me  s o me bo dy  wh o  
coul d us e hi s mout h a l ot, not  al wa
ys for the good, but I 
did.  They de cide d t hat  beside s me  to  
become  one of the leaders, I ha d to 
ge t a n  educati o n i n  theater  a nd get  
a  trai ning to be  a n  actor .  That 
is what I learned, you 
got it fr om professionals, yeah
.  We  played in a lot of 
plays, we  played a lot of 
Shakespe are, we played a lot of Lessing, we  played
 a lot of Moliere.  Oh ye
ah, we played all Gr eek 
plays, 
Mi ds ummer  Ni ght' s Dream
, that was one of our fa vorites.  Th
at is what we 
got and for a little 
poor boy who ha d t o  go t o work wh
e n he  was  not  14 ye ars  ol d, ha d 
to go to work, th
at wa s quite a 
bit.  I ' m ver y  pr oud of it
, t hat I  got that  educati on.
 
 
I 'm sure .  It 's  ver y i nter est ing.
 
 

It made me very strong-wille
d, not stepping aside for 
anybody which I still don't.  
 
 
Good.  Are t here any i nci
dent s or e pi sodes t hat you didn't  rec
ount to me .  Per ha p
s somet hing t hat  
happe ned in your fa mily- - ?
 
 
That  happened i n my fami
l y--.   As I  said  we we re
 ve ry poor , but t hat wa s nor mal .  Sanitar y, my  
mother always 
took care of that, th
at we have that.  Sh
e was a very strong, w
illing woman and very 
good brai ns .  I wa s very s i ck alre
a dy when I wa s t hree  ye ars  ol d.  I 
got an eye sickness.  Amster da m 
is a  s ailor  t own and bi g har bor  wa s t here .  Sa
ilors  br ought the sickne ss 
in which they called  
trachoma.  They br
ought it in and it became 
an epidemic in 
Amsterdam.  My 
little brother was 
barel y two years  ol d and I was  c los e t o four  year s  
old.  No, we  were- - he  was t w o ye ars  ol d whe n  I  
wa s four , we bot h got  t hat  sic kne ss .  We  suffere d 
on that for  a  long, l ong
 time.  Hospital in and  
hos pital  out .  The  me dic are, no me di care  is  here , 
t he car e, t h e medical  care
 for poor people wa s 
quite  organi zed.  Tha t  wa s t ake n c are of.  The r e 
wa s a professor, a doctor in Ei e Care.  He  wa s 
always one of the leader
s i n  the Soci al Democr at ic movement
 and he took care
 of poor people a 
whole lot.  He healed us
, my brother a little fa
ster than me.  We  
both were blind fo
r awhile and then 
when I was ten years, that was th
e last I saw him.
  Still when I go to the doc
tor that fi nds leftovers 
on my eyelids, they can 
tell that I have trachoma wh
en I  was a child.  There ar
e scars on each side o f 
there.  Then I have seve
ral children's sickness, juve
nile sicknesses, like the 
measles and diphtheria.  
I was quite  a long i n t h e hospit al
 as a child.  My mot h
er al wa ys , day a nd night, she was i n t he  
hos pital .  Then I ha d se veral oper ations li ke al l 
children ha ve - - appendix, 
a nd t he t hroat , you know,  
what you cal l them, thr oat operati ons?
 
 
Tonsillectomy?
 
 
Tonsillectomy and all time there wa
s no--fe w years was op
erated without
 any sedation.  We ll, the 
appendicitis, yes but my th
roat no, they just open
 your mouth, they cut 
the ____(170).  They cut 
your e ar a nd that was how i t  wa s.
 
 
I guess so.
 
 
School, sani t ary c are at the sc hool
s wa s ver y good.  A l ot 
better than I see here 
in the United States 
now.  I 'm t al king about 70 ye ar
s ago.  There were--nur ses came ar
ound from the government, fr om 
the city or from the gove
rnme nt it se lf, c a me around
 al ways checking out 
children.  Wh en they 
found something that they
 didn't like or that 
was suspicious, you got a 
little note to the doctor and  
you went to the doct or and you was 
t r eated.  There was no cost, not  th
at I ever rememb
er .  We wer e  

treated a l ot, especi ally t he poor
 children becaus e there was a lot 
of under nourish ment .  What else  
can I tell you?
 
 
This is probably, in term
s of what I will need to
 fill in the information 
for our project, this is 
probabl y ver y, ver y comp rehe nsi ve.  
 
 
My wi fe that  I married, my first  wi fe, she was not
 fr om Amst er da m, she wo
rked in Amst erdam as a 
nurse but she was way out in the so
uth of the Netherlands.  Her fa
ther was a fa rmer
, a cattleman, a 
Jewish cattleman in th
at little village, yeah
 it was a village.  
A very old village, 
older than 800 years  
at least .  The Spani sh were, t her e  wa s a--they ma de a bridge t here 
over the river , t hen the Spanis h 
were fighting the Netherla
nds.  The  Net herla nds  revolt ed a gai nst  
the Spanish, t he ar
mi es came i n.  
That was one of the fi ghtin
g points there.  
That little city, Ge
ertrvidenberg, that
's where my wife  
came fr om.  At the time 
that I knew her, 
there were two Jewish fa mili
es and there wa
s a little shul 
smaller than a bedroom.  
That still is there but no
w it is a monume nt in the city of Ge ertrvidenberg 
because t he Jews are no more t her
e.  There wer e t wo 
Jewish fa milies.  My father-in-law was a 
far mer, my mother -in-l a w, her  br other, a bac hel or 
a nd sever al sist ers, they
 lived--that was all the  
fa mi ly.  The y live d cl ose  to eac h othe r.  My wi fe 's  
olde st si ster, she wa s ki nd of sick al ways a nd the  
Uncle Sam and t he sisters 
took her i n be cause t h ey 
thought my mot her-i n--la w
 had  enough to d o  
wit hout her  four  childre n. The y want ed her , t hey 
wanted the child in the 
hous e t oo and the y li ve d 
close together anyway.  So Betr
ina, the oldest, came 
i n thei r house and wa s de por te d with t he m  
when t he Ger mans deported t hem, 
t hey de port wit h the m.  My wi fe
's--t he next daughter --the  o n e  
who was two years older than
 my wife was, she still 
is alive.  She went sa
fe underground and made  
it thr ough t h e war .  The  next  daught e r , she  we nt wi
t h t he  Ger ma n vurst m acher ,  Juli us  St ern, went  
away.  She l ived in
 Ams t erda m too.  Her  na me was He nni e;
 He nni e t hat wa s fr om Hendri ka .  Sh e  
lived next to the Fran
ks--An ne Frank's house.
 
 
Oh, reall y.
 
 
Whe n the  Fr anks  were  under groun
d, I have known these people.  
I have seen them
.  Because my  
Henni e, she lived i n t he 
fa mi ly.  She was at Meyer's the ho us
ekee per  a nd the  fa mil y Meyer  li ve d 
next  t o  it.  Sa me canal, s a me gra cht .  The n  the r
e  wa s a  br othe r, the  youngest  br othe r a nd he  ca me 
through t he war .  He die d begi nni ng
 of t his year , 1992, but he  made
 it through the wa
r.  During the 
war, my fat h er-in-law, my mot her-i n-law, t he se
c o nd da ughter , my wi fe a n
d the younge st da ughter , 
they all  went under groun
d.  M y wi fe wa s t he onl y one a ctive i n 
t he Re sista nce .  The r e st of the m  
just  were  he lped by other people  a n d sta yed un
derground until th
e  wa r  was  ov er.   That  i s  my  
fa mily-in-law.
 
 
They were fortunate.
 

 
They lived way out in the 
countr y  a nd di dn't  foll ow a ny orde rs 
fr om the Germans that they had to 
go t o Amsterdam t o be r egistered and li ve i n an
other house because t hat  
was promised. 
 We take 
care of your house and we take car
e of your work, you w
ill be working.  That 
was all the lies around 
the deportati on.  They di dn't belie
ve them and they didn'
t do it.  By that time, I was already in a 
labor  ca mp, April 25, t ha t  
you find in my  register.
 
 
I want  to tha nk yo
u ver y, very much.
 
 
Did you get enough?
 
 
I thi nk so.
 
 
Ok ay.  Now I'm going to take fr om
 you. . . .  My sister was ma rried
 to a non-Jew w
ho wa s born in 
Ger ma n y.  This Dut c h pe ople l i ve d 
in Ne ure nbe rg, Ger ma ny.  The r e 
he wa s born s o he  gre w up a  
German.  When Hitler came  in power, all th
e--that is how Hitler 
had a solution to the 
une mployme nt i n Ger ma ny.  Se nt 
all  the  pe ople who are not Ger ma n
s out of the coun
try.  So my 
brot her-i n-la w Nor bert ,  he  ha d to go out  of t he  c
ountry.  He came into 
the Netherlands where he  
knew he had fa mily and that's wher
e he met my  sister.  He  got a jo
b, he  married her, not my wi fe , 
my sist er.  He marrie d he r and sa
ved her duri ng t h e war.  She wa s a
rre ste d onc e and he stepped int o 
the headquar ters or in t he office 
wher e she was i n the cel l.  He 
bos sed the m  around be ca use bor n in  
Germany, he know exactly how to talk to them an
d bawled them out, barked
 li ke a dog, you know,  
Let my wi fe  go, what  is  
the matter with you people? 
 That  is how he  went .  
When he  t r ied to sa ve  
my mot her , I was al rea d y in a la bor  
camp, he onl y coul d see t hat t he 
truck that was lo
aded just left 
the street .  And he  ca me  t o s a ve
 her a n d he j ust  ca me  too l ate .
 
 
We ll, tha t 's  t oo ba d.
 
 
But he saved my  sister dur
ing the war, my  sister dur
ing the war.  We  are very
 grate f ul  so he was my 
brot her  too.
 
 
Is it  okay i f I  
stop the tape now?
 
 
That is fi ne.  We  had it all.
