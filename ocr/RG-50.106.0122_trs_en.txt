 older brother, he™s deceased now. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Michael. 
Q: And what were the name

the two sister s,

and 
Bertha.

Q: Could you tell us about your childhood?

A: My childhood I could really sum up ve
ry little. I made a Œ it wa Œ it was all 
Jewish Œ mo stly Jewish education, going 
to service in the s
ynagogue, studying in 
the evening, in the a Œ in th
e afternoon, whenever, Sundays.
 So, I really didn™t have 
too mu ch  fun to  Œ to be with other kids 
who are playing ball or having fun. It was 
all studying Jewish religion. 
Q: Did you have any Œ did you live in
 a small town  or in a big town? 
A: A big city. 
Q: Mm-hm. Were there lots of Jews there? 
A: Yes, we Œ we had a lot Œ lots of Jews
, we had religious Jews, not Œ conservative 
and also the non-Conservative, whatever they call them. 
Q: Reform. 
A: Reform, that™s right, and we had 
Yeshivas 
in our Œ in our Œ Jewish 
Yeshivas.
 It 
was a bi Œ nice, big city that it was Œ it was real nice to be soci
alizing with Œ with 
your own people. I me an, you 
had everything you wanted.  
Q: Tell us about your education. 

A: I went to school, to public school 
til 1943. In 1943, the Œ I was Œ a-as an 
individual Jew I was always beaten  up by 
the kids in s Œ in  th
e school, including the 
teacher. My history teacher, I remember in
 1943, I came a little late to school, he 
was waiting for me outside the door at the 
Œ outside the class door
 and Œ and firmly

pulled me in, in front of the kids, he 
went ahead and pu-punched me all over my  
face, in front of the kids. The kids we
re laughing, giggling, and I was Œ I was 
hurting and they were enjoying it. That 
was number one. Then on the way going 
home from school, four kids attacked me 
not far from my home. They Œ I fought 
back. I was bleeding. They 
punched me all over my face
 and kicked me. I fi Œ 
fought back hard, but I couldn't Œ  I was 
outnumb ered. I was bleeding, and not them. 
Then  Œ th at Œ that was the end of my  sc
hools, I couldn™t go any mo re to school 
because of that. 
Q: How was your Jewish Œ how would you 
describe your Jewish education? When 
did you go to 
cheder, 
or Jewish school? 
A: I went to 
cheder
 and to ser Œ to services til 1943,
 til things got really worse. In 
1943 under the Nazis, things got miserabl
e and it got worse all the time. As a Jew 
you weren™t allowed to go out
, only during the day and ce
rtain hours, and you had 
to wear a yellow star and a yellow armb
and. I remember we went to evening 
service, evening service with
 my father once and the two 
SS, 
the Hungarian Nazis 
came in and beat up all the Jews in ther e and everybody was running in different 

directions, but mo st of them escaped and Œ and that was the end of th e synagogues, 
we Œ we couldn™t go no more for services
 and there wasn™t servi Œ anyway, the end 
for my  father and me. Th-They blocked off 
all the synagogues, we couldn™t in Œ all

busin esses and properties were taken away  
from Jews. There was just no place that 
you Œ you Œ you felt safe. 
Q: Did you know th at there was a war going on in  
Europe
 at that time? 
A: Yes, we did, but we didn™t know to
o mu ch about it because all we knew, we 
were Œ first of all we had no communica
tion with the outside 
world. Wi Œ there 
wasn™t telephones like you have here, 
that you could call up somebody and r-right 
away you™d tell them Œ any place you move
d, you had to have a pass and th-the 
police were patrolling everywhere, every 
di Œ so often you would driv e down  
someplace or walk down, you 
had to have a pass with y
ou. And if you sh Œ you 
were Œ you were Jewish, right
 away you had to have a Je
wish pass and th at you™re 
circumsi-cised, all that stuff had to be on 
it, on. So there Œ there wasn™t really too 
mu ch we could do. 

Q: When did you notice Œ when did you realize that things were really getting bad? 

Was it in 1943? 
A: In 1943. 
Q: Until then things were nice and pleasant? 

A: It was Œ it was pre Œ pretty pleasa
nt. We could feel the tension from the 
SS
. We 
could st Œ of the Nazis, we could feel 
the tension, but we were still in our own 
homes, we could still go out and do some 
shopping. You had to
 watch yourself

because you were beaten up 
or taken away the Œ some of the Jews disappeared. But 
we Œ 
Q: Did you know where they disappeared to ? 
A: No, no, probably got ‚em Œ ki
-killed them. Proba
bly killed them. 
Q: Mm-hm. When did 
the Germans come to 
Chust
? 
A: Oh, I don™t rememb er exactly, but I Œ I 
know they were Œ they were there for 
quite awhile before 1943. And when they came
 in th-there were Œ it™s Œ things just Œ 

I can Œ I can remember not only they take
 aw ay the business and properties, they 
trained some of the young boys, like my sel
f, I was 13 at that time, they trained us 
just like being in the army. Bu
t th Œ we Œ I called this the 
torture training. What they 
did, they  Œ we marched in step and if 
somebody ri Œ step Œ 
didn™t Œ wa-wasn™t going 
Œ marching the step, there™s one Nazi who 
I knew my father Œ 
I Œ I knew very well 
because he lived across the street, his fath
er owned a bar there, he lived across the 
street from my  uncle™s house. And his son 
was there, he was Œ he was in charge, he 
was called an 
SS
, you know, Nazi. And Œ 
Q: Was he German, or Œ 

A: No, Hungarian. 
Q: 
[indecipherable] 
Hu ng arian .

A: Hungarian, yeah. And he, if somebod
y didn™t po Œ go one step, he would go 
ahead and kick him with his 
boot, and I™m te Œ the poin
t on his boot, he had a piece 
of iron welded on, a pointed piece of ir
on, and when he ki
cked you, you Œ I 
remember, he kicked me seve
ral times because I wasn™t 
going in steps and I felt Œ 
when he kicked me I f Œ th-t
he pain was so miser able, so
 painful, I Œ for years I was 
suffering with it, I remember it. A nd I coul
dn™t do nothing because if I would have 
tried to hit him back or do something like 
that, I Œ I Œ probably would have been  the 
end of me. 
Q: So it was around 1942 th at things got really bad, or before that? 

A: It Œ it started, it started to get bad at that
 time, but it wasn™t real
ly that bad, that Œ 
we could still go out shopping 
and Œ and do the things. We 
had to be very careful, 
but it™s just like we live today in  this coun
try, I™ll tell you, I b Œ you™re afraid to 
walk the streets. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And it™s not that the criminals 
and crooks are roaming the streets. 
Q: And the anti-Semitism
 increased when the Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: And before 1942 y
ou did not experience Œ 
A: Oh yes. 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

Q: Oh, you did experience? 
A: Oh yes, we had ex perience. There was 
a lot of anti-Semitism. T oo many Jew ha 
Œ Jew haters. That Œ that was part of it 
that I don™t know, somehow th-the parents 
taught the children to hate Jews, th at the Je
ws were Christ killers and the Jews have 

got everything. The Jews have got Œ are ri ch, which was not true, not all the Jews 

were rich. 

Q: Did you come from a wealthy family? 
A: No, I did not. 
Q: So, you did not have
 any non-Jewish friends? 
A: I had a Œ a few of them. I had a few wh
o lived in my  neighborhood, I Œ we lived 
in a Œ in a Œ in a neighborhood with Œ 
which was maybe 40 pe
rcent Jewish and 60 
percent non-Jewish. But ever
ybody lived in peace, we 
Œ my mother had a friend 
across the street, she was a Hungarian wo
man, she had two sons, and she would 
come on Saturdays, turn 
on the stove for us for 
Shabbat
, because Œ and th en she did 
a lot of things that we weren™t allowed to
 do. She was so nice, we would give her 
stuff for that, you know, in re
turn. My mo ther used to be
 close friends with her, but 
when the time came, d u ring the Nazi regime, 
they Œ they were a
fraid to ta Œ even 
talk to us. They were afra
id to say anything because th
 Œ if you Œ if we comu  Œ 
communicated with it Œ with 
Œ with them, with a non-Jew, we probably Œ th ey 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

probably  would lock  them up too, because
 they were not allowed to do that no 
more. They were even Œ th-t
he goyim, the non-Jews we
re afraid to communicate. 
Q: So you came from 
a religious family. 
A: Yes. 
Q: From an Orthodox family. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Yes. 
Q: How old were you when
 Œ when the war broke? 
A: The br Œ war broke out? 
Q: Broke out, yeah. 
A: My God, I cannot go back . I don™t even
 know what Œ which 
year the bro Œ the 
war broke out because we didn™t feel it th
at much, we Œ we di
dn™t know what was 
going on. 
Q: So it was really only in what, ™42, that Œ 
A: ™42 - ™43, something like that. Maybe Œ I think 
Hitler
 occupied 
Czechoslo Œ
 part 
of 
Czechoslovakia
 in 1941 and I don™t know the 
Œ wh en the next time he ch Œ 
occupied. But we had si Œ before the N
azis took it over, we had Ukraines took it 
over. There Œ there was two or three differe
nt groups, they  took it over, we had to 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

learn different languages. Then the Hunga
rian took it over and they were Œ they 
were really in charge because they were 
Œ they were working together with Œ with 
the Germans. I remember in Œ my father, 
who we Œ we got milk from an lo Œ next 
door neig hbor fo r many years, and wh en, 
in 1943 we weren Œ we weren™t allowed 
to do that, but we did it anyway  because we 
had to go just to th
e next door neighbor, 
who broo Œ took off a couple
 boards from our backyard fe
nce and we went through. 
But we had, across the street 
there were two sisters and a 
brother who lived th  Œ a-at 
Œ at Œ and they Œ they  could see us from th
e second floor that we were getting milk 
from our next door neighbor. Th
ey reported my fa
ther to the police.
 They picked up 
my  pro Œ the police picked up 
my father and they took hi
m j Œ to jail. M-My mother 
was hoping that they™re not going to beat 
him u-up, you know, they ™re just going to 
take him to jail. But after two weeks he 
came back, he came back with his black 
eyes, his whole face was just black. They
 beat him up all the time an d Œ and his 
beard was chopped up to pieces
. So that Œ that was one and it™s Œ it Œ it was so many 
Œ I mean, it™s hard to believe what was 
going on. These thing you
 could see, things 
are just coming to a point wh
ere people were afraid Œ we were, as a Jew was afraid 
if Œ they were afraid to go
 out on the street. Everyone taken, just grabbed from the 
street and taken away some
place, you disappeared or Œ 
nobody knew where you le 
Œ wh ere Œ where Œ where you went.

Q: When  were you required to wear a 
Jewish star? Was it during that time? 
A: Yes, during that time. We Œ 1943, we
 had to wear a yellow star or yellow 
armb and if we went out to the shopping, 
or Œ or go food shopping or go anyplace, 
we had to wear that star. 
Also, in Œ I think I™ve Œ I™ve mentioned about this trainer 
who trained Jewish boys, that Nazi would 
train Jewish boys. We Œ we had to  Œ not 
only did he kick us for Œ wh en we Œ wh -when 
we went in Œ in steps, but he also wi 
Œ made us climb a ladder that was about th
ree feet low from the to
p to get up on the 
Œ on top of a barn. We had to climb up ther
e on top and we Œ in or
der to reach it, we 
had to go pull ourselves up. And order Œ 
if we came down, we didn™t catch the 
ladder, we would step on it an
d we would just go back  down  on our back and th e 
ladder wo uld fall on our back, on stone
s on the bottom and it was hell. 
Q: Was that in school, that Œ 

A: No, th at was on th  Œ on Œ on a field 
Œ football field that we Œ we had that 
training. There was no school in there. That was away from everything. 
Q: How come you were pa
rt of that group? 
A: Because they ti Œ picked 
up all the th Œ they got orde
rs, all the Je
wish boys from 
a certain age, you™ve got Œ you gotta come to 
Leventher
(ph) they called it. 
Leventher
(ph), 
Leventher
(ph) that Œ I don™t know that™s Hungarian. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer  
 
October 19, 1993 
 

 
 
13
A: Yeah. And tha-that™s what they called 
the Œ they asked all the Œ those Jewish 
boys should meet at this and this place. 
So I met them. My brother was already in 
the la Œ at la Œ in the labor camp at that 
time. My father was al
so in the labor camp 
for six months. 
Q: Tell us about Œ ab out your father and brother being sent to labor camp . When  did 

that happen? 

A: That also happened sometimes at the e
nd of fo Œ 1943. My father was drafted 
first t-to the ar Œ to the labor army, labor 
camp, to Œ to labor wo
rk. Before that he 
served two or three years, he fought on 
the battlefields. H e had guns and rifles with 
him, he Œ he fought like a soldier. 
Q: For who? 
A: For Œ for the enemy, whoever the enem
y was. I don™t know who they fought. I 
wasn™t maybe on the Œ 

Q: On th e Œ on the side of whom did you fight? 
A: I don™t Œ I don™t know. I Œ tho-those da
ys I don™t know. That wasn™t during the Œ 
during th e Nazi occupation, no. Bu t that 
was before sometimes he may have war Œ 
fought for Œ with the Russian
s or Ukrainians, I have got no idea, but I was too 
young to  know about that. But what happene
d is, he fought befo
re he would Œ he 
was Œ he was in the army. He got a rifle 
and ammunition, he fought like a soldier. 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

Because he was Jewish, they 
put him to work cutting down
 Œ they gave him an axe 
and a saw and he was cutting down  
trees, chopping th em up and so on. 
Q: When  was that? 
A: That was in 1940
 Œ end of 1943.  
Q: And your brother, too? 
A: And my brother went also in 1944, th
e beginning of 1940 
Œ he was drafted and 
we heard from him only once. My mo ther 
sent him some baked cookies and it was 
returned to  Œ they couldn™t find him no mo re, he was gone. So Œ 

Q: When  was the last time you saw your brother? 

A: The last time I™ve seen him Œ you mean
 bef Œ 1944? The Œ before, oh about four 
or five weeks before 
Pesach. 
And 
Pesach 
came Œ we Œ we had Œ first day of 
Pesach
 
was April Œ April 1944. Table was set, 
everything was there except my  brother 
Michael
 and all my  whole family was together, except my  brother
 Michael. 
Q: And your father was with you then? 

A: He was with me, yeah. 
Q: Was he back from the labor camp? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer  
 
October 19, 1993 
 

 
 
15
A: He was back from the labor camp, and he
 Œ oh yeah , that Œ w-we Œ the table was 
set, we were 
[indecipherable]
 the best food was set up on
 the table. All the family 
was sitting, my two sisters, three b rothers
 and my parents were all sitting at the 
table and when my father started to make 
kiddush
, he cried. He said, he would cr Œ 
he Œ he Œ in the middle of the 
kiddush
 he broke down  and cr
ied. He said these 
words, he says, who knows whether we will 
be together again next year. We cried 
with him, as children, you 
know, and my  Œ my  older sist
er tried to c-calm us down, 
but we cried just like after a funeral. It was a very sad 
Pesach.
 The next day we 
were taken from Œ we Œ two 
SS 
Œ Hungarian s Œ Nazis came 
and gave us orders that 
we have to  Œ we mu st be out of the 
house by Œ it was in tw
o hours. That™s Œ 
something like that, or less. They were 
waiting outside. We packed  up ev erything as 
soon as we could, you know, and my  m Œ 
we wen Œ went Œ they to ok us at Œ at 
gunpoint, they took 
us to the ghetto. 
Q: And was the ghetto in
 Chust
? 
A: Yes, the ghetto was in 
Chust. 
They  blocked off a few, tw
o or three streets. We 
had a synagogue in there, 
we were blocked off, and a 
tomatorah
(ph). And they 
packed in everybody
 as much as they c
ould without food, water, or toilet facilities. I 
remember I was inside, there 
wasn™t even an-any room to 
sit. They selected a few Œ 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer  
 
October 19, 1993 
 

 
 
16
th-th-they selected two leaders, tw o well re
putable Jewish leaders in the Œ in th Œ 
from the Jewish community 
to run the Œ the ghetto. 
Q: Do you remember their names? 
A: 
Ramel
(ph) 
Moskov
(ph), but I don™t remember the other one.
 Mo sko v
(ph) was 
one of them.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And they  were in ch arge how to run th
e ghetto. We Œ they selected some running 
boys. They selected running b
oys for Œ to, you know, take 
messa Œ like for instance, 
mine Œ my  job was, as a running boy, a 
few running boys, we got passes that we 
could go out 24 hours a day. 
Q: So you were a messenger. 
A: A messenger, yeah . My Œ my  job was, as
 a messenger, to take messages to the 

sergeant who was in charge. Anything that 
came in and it went out, he had to sign 
it. And ev ery time I would Œ needed somethi
ng to  sign, I had to ru n to the Œ to two 
bars, wa Œ he was in one of the tw o bars
. Sometimes so drunk he di Œ ji Œ didn't 
even look at a paper, he just signed it. 

Q: So in  other word s, the day after Pass
over, you had to pack 
your suitcases and 
move to the ghetto. 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer  
 
October 19, 1993 
 

 
 
17
A: Whatever we could get, that™s right. Mo
-Move at gunpoint, we 
got to go to ba Œ 
ghetto, that™s correct. 
Q: Could you tell us about th
e conditions in the ghetto? 
A: Yes. The conditions in the ghetto was,
 everybody was sitting with  a little bundle, 
whatever they took along,
 on th e floor. Lean ing over 
next to one another, there 
wasn™t even any sitting room in the rooms.
 And with no water, no toilet facilities, 
only i Œ what the synagogue had and there wa
s outside one only. Then the rest of it, 
the food, which was available, we, the me
ssen g ers got okay fro
m the sergeant that 
we can go to different Jewish homes and 
pick up all the good 
e Œ good stuff, like 
they had stuff in jars, you kn
ow, with the Œ for the Œ for th
e living. So we picked up 
all that stuff from home, brought it over to 
the ghetto. That™s only thing that we had 
to eat. Then also, some of the ink Œ all Œ 
all Œ people in the Œ in the ghetto, in cluding 
my father, beca Œ sat down with me and they 
told me e Œ that I am
 Œ I can go out 24 
hours a day, I™ve got the pass. N-Next Œ ar
ound the corner the 
Œ from the building, 
from the synagogue, there is a Œ a Œ there 
was a Jewish st ore by the go Œ non-Jew 
took it over. And it™s a grocery store and he
 gets some breads every day, I don™t 
know how many, 15 - 20 lo af, whatever. If Œ 
they asked me I should ask him if they 
co Œ would sell some bread f-for us and we
™ll pay the price, there™s no problem for 
money. I talked to th e Œ to owner, he okay
ed  it. I used to get from him six, eight

18
loaves of breads and I would put them un
der my  jacket on both sides and wait for 
the Œ for the guards to turn
 their faces away. And some of us knew already Œ 
somebody knew that I™m gonna come there w
ith the breads to th
e window and they 
saw me coming, they opened up the window 
fast, and I just threw it in one, two, 
three and I took off. We have been done Œ 
we have done that every single day. We 
had to Œ we had to gamb le with our liv
es because that was part of survival. 
Whatever we could get in, the little babies
 and ch ildren could at least eat. And then 
I also Œ 

Q: Did people work while they
 were living in the ghetto? 
A: No, no. No work. You 
weren't allowed to
 go no place, only inside, whatever, 
there was nothing to  do, you were Œ there was 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: How many people did th
ey put in that ghetto? 

A: Oh gosh, I would say there were severa
l hundred in  there. They  would Œ they

A: Yes, I™ll be glad to. We arrived to 
Auschwitz Œ 
I mean to, excuse me, we arrived 
to 
Warsaw
 and they had built cement block Œ ce
ment blocks bara Œ barracks. The 
barracks had bunkers and we 
Œ we had one blanket to Œ 
for each prisoner. We used 
to pray whenever we coul

to move, he wouldn™t move, because the 
Torah says you™re not allowed to move 
your feet when you stand th e

. So the 
ka po
 co mes and puts in his brass 
knuckles and gets ahold on
 the man in the back while
 he was still standing the 

Amidah
 and turn s him around an d punches hi
m in the face with the nu Œ brass 
knuckles. He threw him against the cement
 block and as he bounced Œ the head  
bounced back, he was punc Œ re-punching 
him again. Constantly  his eyes were

black, his face was chopped up like a hamb urger, you couldn™t recognize the face. 
He just kept on beating him, he had big

 he just kept on pounding 
him. He had a Œ his fa Œ that Œ that 
man had a 16 years ol
d son, his son was 
watching how his father got killed like th

hing we could do, 
because the minute you made a move, you

Jewish life would Œ didn™t mean anything. 

Q: Were there any people from
 Chust
 in 
Warsa w
? 
A: Yes, yes, oh yes. There were Œ there we
re quite a few of them in there. I don™t

Solomon
(ph) who 
lives in 
New York
, but he was an older man, maybe he™s Œ he™s in the ground by 
now. That™s why I™m trying to tell my  test

Holo caust, because the time is
 running out for me too. 
I don™t know how long I™m 
gonna be here and the world must know

Œ that si Œ the big sign said 
Warsaw
 whatever, I forgot the name, but it was a big 
sign, big sign, it said

ghetto, or whatever. Then 
we worked in there to 
clean up the ghetto and whatever usable 
items w-we found, we shipped it to 
Germany
 to be reused. We cleaned up the br
icks from the bombed a-area and they 
sh-shipped it to 
Germany
 to u Œ to  use it for s Œ b-building other ammunition 
factories, w h atever.

 some of the 
women with the

 were hanging next Œ were right next to th em and they™re 
just like you Œ they  just took it off. We

children huddled  together. We Œ th ere Œ it 
was so unbelievable that they were Œ it 
could have been a fami ly, although some

d to survive, they 
held together for their Œ during the bombi

they Œ I remember we used 
to take off their shinbones

how old these children were. I™ve got now

Q: Were you organized? Was there some
 kind of organization from the Jewish 
prisoners? 
A: N-No, no. 
Q: Nobody was a leader, or Œ 

A: You™re not Œ you wouldn™t allowed to
 have Œ be a leader, because the minute 

they heard you were a leader, you were

We have black coffee and a piece of bread

d through the forest so no
body could see us. And we 
came Œ we came Œ it to ok us about
 a half an hour to get to march there, to Œ to the

A: That™s right, yeah. And 
once on the way going to 
work , we wo Œ sometimes, 
once or twice a week, we would see German 
trucks loaded with partisans. How we 
knew they  were partisans, while we were
 marching si Œ the back cover opened up 
from the wind, it would just open up, I coul
d see them. They were blindfolded with 

black rags, their eyes and tied up in  the ba
ck. I remember seeing some of the faces, 
you know, turning; they  heard th e marc
hing, you know, the 
noises from marching. 
They turned towards us, and 
I said to myself, God, I wish, oh, I wish I could help

you. I don™t know Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I felt so ba
d. I wish I could have gone over and just 
blown out the whole thing with
 them so th-they wouldn™t take them. And then  they 
would take them to Œ to the Œ to a place 
which was right in ou
r Œ on the ou-outside 
of the Œ from our camp wh ere we Œ wh ere w Œ and Œ an d there was a 
slaughterhouse. They  put up a cement bl
ock outsi Œ you know, it™s Œ was outside, 
but a Œ a wall, four walls. And they  woul
d take in those prisoners, I mean, the 
partisans, shoot them out. In
 th e evening you™d hear the 
machine guns going for 10 
- 15 minutes. They Œ they wou Œ in fact, 
when we used to 
Œ sometimes when it 
rained and the ground was wet, and we wa
lk ed in their direction, my  wooden shoes 
had a line, like red Œ red ink Œ red Œ red Œ 
red paint, but it was blood. The blood was 
Œ was soaked over the ground in there,
 they used to k
ill so many of them. 
Q: And you were taken at four in

w o rk  and  th en  Œ 
A: We quit around f Œ when Œ later in the 
evening, about eight, 10 hours sometimes.

10 hours a day we

 w Œ took off, all the time.

A: No, only bre Œ wa Œ only th ing you took 
along with you, if 
you had a piece of 
bread Œ I remember I u sed to take alonga piece of bread in my  pocket, sew it in 
because there was no pockets and save it.
 When I was ready 
to Œ to faint from 
hunger, I would take a little 
crumb and put it on my tongue 
and just keep on sucking 
on it to keep me alive. And 
you know, one day, there wa
s one a Œ one interesting i-
i-incident. I Œ I was walking, you know, I wa
s like in an Œ in an area where I Œ I was 
digging up bricks to be cleaned up. And a
ll of a sudden I got hit on my  ankle with a 
piece of brick. And I turned around Œ that
 hurted Œ I turned around and I look 
around, I didn™t see nobody. I said oh, forg
et it, maybe somebody just in a joke did 
something. Then  suddenly I see little pebbles
 flying around me and I got hit again in 
my foot, a little higher. I turned around, I said
 to myself, oh boy, that Œ I got to find 
out who that is. I turned around and 
I see somebody sticking Œ somebody was 
sticking out the Œ the head from under the 
rubble, just enough to  see his head. He 
had black hair on and he was 
pointing with his finger to Œ 
to follow him, to ca Œ to 
go Œ to escape. Now, I made two steps a
nd I suddenly  jump ed
 back, I said to 
my self, oh my  God, I rememb er I got beaten
 up by a Œ the lead pipe. I cannot take 
that pain no more. I™m still 
hurting from it, I™m still in 
pain. And I didn Œ wouldn™t 
go, but he was trying to  ma Œ make me 
escape. A lot of the prisoners escaped. 
Q: Uh-huh.

A: But tha Œ tha Œ they escap
e and probably they
 caught them, because they kept on 
killing them all the time. Yes,
 so then, from there I had 
the Œ the Russians started t-
to Œ we Œ di Œ oh yeah , you 
used to get so many of the 
partisans, so many captured  
of the partisans that they 
decided to build a cremator
ium, a small one. First we 
thought it™s going to  be a bakery. We were
 waiting and waiting, we were asking Œ I 
know the people who bou Œ built it were 
Katz
(ph), they lived in my city. A young 
son and a fath Œ it™s a father and son. We™re
 waiting for it to be finished, and here Œ 
everybody™s talking a bakery , a bakery, wh at else could it be? He finally was 

finished and it was a Œ before we were su
pposed to be liquidating the camp, and w-
we found out it was a small crematorium. 
It looked like a Œ a 
bakery. They killed 
the father and son first, they bur-burned th
em, they were the first ones to burn. We, 
at two Œ two days later the comma nding offi
cer told us that we™re going to go Œ 
we™re going to liquidate the camp , and Œ 

Q: Do  yo u  reme mb er t h e n ame 
of the comma nder of that camp ? 
A: No, no, I cannot rememb er. My head  were
 blank after that, I got hit with a lead 
pipe and I had Œ from hunger 
and thirst we were just Œ 
you couldn™t think straight. 
Okay, where was I? 
Q: Yeah, before you had to liquidate the camp.

told us that we™re going to
 liquidate the camp  next da

asked all those prisoners w

uck, about a hundred of 
them, moved out, they marched them straight to the slaughterhouse, and we Œ wh ile 
we were standing in role call, they were
 Œ we could hear the machine guns going 
that killed them all. They hung six prisone
rs on wooden poles, and they™d sa Œ th-
the comma nding officer said, 
the reason why they™re Œ th
at we hung them is 
because they de Œ tried to escape yesterda
y. We found out this Œ this is go Œ going

pick them up, put them in carts and put 
them in Œ then on truc
ks and sh ip them to 
Dachau

 near a bridge. We

put them on top one another, we dug deep en ough to  Œ just to put in  the bodies on 
top one an other. One was still alive 
on top on Œ he was 
begging us, please 
[speaks

 he says 
[speaks foreign language]
. I™m still living. Why 
are you trying to  kill me? Why are you two bu
r Œ why are you burying me alive? He 

was stretching out a hand to  us, and the
 SS
 kept on hollering. He says, cover him 
up, cover him up. We covered 
him up, we had to take o ff. We marched again. They 
had Œ their fa Œ con Œ I mean, the Œ the Œ th
-the-the prisoners are just falling like Œ 
it™s unbelievable, they™re just collapsin
g from Œ from hunger and th irst and 
dehydration. You can survive a lot longer 
from not eating food, 
but if you don™t 
have any water Œ try to go fo r water in th
e sun all day long, marching, without the 
hat, nothing, just in your uniform. We came 
to a place near Œ near a bridge in the Œ 
some of the prisoners tried to escape. They
 jumped over the bridge, tried to escape 
or to get Œ to  get some water. They  send 
in the German Shepherds after them, and 
they Œ after the germ Œ th-the shepherds 
found them, they went ahead and used the 

machine gun, boom, boom, boom, they killed 
them in there. Then
 we Œ we used to 
get Œ one day it was raining hard
 and we were told to go in
to a forest. We went into 
that forest and we slept on 
the ground without coverage, 
we didn™t have nothing, 
just our uniform. But, I mean
 it™s th-the Œ ty phus develo
ped and th ey were dying all 
over.

A: Gosh , I don™t remember. I don™t know , maybe four or five days, I don™t 
reme mb er. I™ve got no idea, just kept on Œ 
it was just Œ I was in another world, I 
didn't  even know. When we st
opped at that place, we were Œ some of the prisoners 
were digging with their spoons. We very
 seldom had spoons, we ate by the Œ our 
hands. I don™t know wh ere th
ey got the spoons, 
but they were digging th e ground, 
where there™s Œ th-the ground, there wasn™t
 too far away from a lake. And we heard 
sometimes after midnight a huge roar, wa
ter, water, everybody™s running to wards 
water, water, water. I came over to that place 
too, with the other prisoners and I see 
everybody™s grabbing handsful, it Œ from 
the ground it™s coming up water about Œ 
oh, about two, three feet, 
it™s jump ing up, pop-popping 
up. I remember everybody 
was grabbing

 the bottom had Œ 
Q: They were digging with 
their spoons to find water? 
A: To find water, yes, and they  found it, 
came up enough. The-They  Œ and suddenly  
everybody knew about it, the prisoners knew 
about it and they ran for water. Wi Œ I 
reme mb er grabbing hands full of water with
 sand and stones and just shoving it into 
my throat, swallowing, chok
ing my self on the stones. I 
couldn™t even Œ you know, 
it™s hard to believe that Œ that Œ we Œ we
 were crazy, we didn™t know, we were out 
of our minds. We didn™t know from life or death, we didn™t know wh at Œ who we

are or where Œ what we are. We were just 
oh, completely out. We were Œ we were Œ 
something that it™s hard to believe that 
a human being can Œ can su rvive something 
like that. 
Q: And you finally arrived in 
Da chau
? 
A: No, next day we to ok Œ marched again. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: We finally arrived to a place where we
 were waiting for a train. It was called 
Kutno
. 
Kutn o
 at the Œ at the German
 Polish border. German Œ 
Kutno
 at the 
German Polish border, yeah. And 
we were waiting there for a train to arrive to take 
us someplace. It was p ouring, it was rain
ing hard. First when we got there, we 
stripped all the bark from the trees. Anythi
ng th at was available, branches, we just 
ate. Grass, whatever we can get ahold on
, anything. We were starved, we didn™t 

have nothing to Œ 

Q: How many days did you 
march to Œ to get to 
Kutno
? 
A: Oh, I have got no idea. Four or five days, I can™t Œ don™t rememb er. 

Q: And all that time w ithout food? 

A: Without food, without wate
r, skeletons were walking. 
Q: Oh my Œ

A: Skeletons were walking. There was 
nothing Œ black lips, with Œ with dying 
there™s no breathe Œ you can™t hardly breath
e, you™re so weak. And we Œ we waited 
in that forest, it was p ouri
ng and we were Œ were in th
e mud. We were trying to 
huddle together so we can get our body 
temperature warm from one another. That™s 
only heat we had and th e prisoners were 
starting to die from typhus and all the 
temperature, they had high temperatures 
from being sick, and they were dying like f 
Œ by the dozens. We could not bury them fa
st enough. Finally, two days later a train 
arrived, a freight train arrived. They pack
ed  in  in the boxcars a hundred or mo re 
people in one boxcar. I reme
mb er we were standing like 
this, in the upright position 
like sn Œ stacked herring. Ther
e was no air, no water, no food.  
Q: No sanitation. 
A: No sanitation. They boarded up the 
little w indows from outside, what the freight 
gets. There was Œ it was choking inside. We 
were tearing our head s apart, we were 
trying to  kill ourselves, but we co uldn™t. We
 were tearing our eyes out, we were ki Œ 
pounding on our head s. We ti Œ we couldn
™t Œ we wanted to die, but there was no 
way then there, we couldn™t even take a little 
step to get a Œ to do something, to Œ to 

kill ourselves. They just kept on falling an
d dying, from the weakness some of them 
collapsed, then the al Œ the 
smell was awful. And we started to get mo re room once 
some of them passed out or just Œ just 
couldn™t do any mo re, couldn™t get it Œ go on

Dach au
 death camp . I reme mb er seven of us were 
moved out Œ were Œ were Œ came out from th
at freight car. The rest of them were 
half dead or dead, from the 110. We gets Œ 
as we came down , there was six feet of a 
drop. The 
SS
 kept on sh Œ pulling 
us, you know, gra Œ gra
bbing us with the rifle 
butts, hitting us and he
 Œ come on, come on 
[indeciphera ble]
 you, and I remember 
they grabbed me from Œ they grabbed me 
fr Œ with one hand, and I fell on my left 
shoulder upside down, becaus
e the six foot drop. And I 
couldn™t move, I kept on 
crawling, they kept on

the rifle butts. And just 
[speaks

. And th Œ I kept on running. I 
kept on getting 
up and kept on 
going up. I didn™t want to die ab Œ I always 
remember what my fath
er told me at the 
Auschwitz
, be strong, don™t give up, we will me
et again. I just kept on going. We 
finally came into 
the Œ inside the 
Dach au
 entrance on the Œ it was cement floor. I 
remember seeing dozens of skeletons, their 
eyes in, you know, you could hard ly see 
like eyeballs where goo Œ they were just 
sunk in. And these skeletons, all in black 
lips, all they were moaning and moaning a
nd moan Œ I remember I ca Œ I fell o Œ I 
collapsed on my knees and I passed out, an
d there I fell asleep. When I woke up I 
suddenly remembered, oh 
I mi Œ I got to meet my father again, I better be Œ I got to

 up and moved around a little bit, here and

Landsberg 
lager s Œ lager seven, camp

 on on a night shift to work  at 
Mü h l do rf
, that 
night shift to Œ to build th

[indecipherable]
 we Œ we set 
a foundation, the foundation th ere. We used
 to wo rk 10 Œ 10 hou
rs a day. It was 
hard wo rk . I reme mb er one day one of the 
prisoners collapsed on the ramp with his 
sack of cement. The 
SS
 ran over Œ two 
SS 
ran over and pounded on his head  with 
his rifle butt. And th en they Œ th ey asked 
for Œ for the prisoners 
to help him put on 
this sandbag. I went ose Œ I was one of th
em, too, I went over and helped to put it 
up, and he couldn™t get up, he co uldn™t get 
up. They went ahead and asked some of 
the prisoners to take him ups
tairs and put him in the ceme
nt mixer. They  put in his 
head in the cement mix er, and 
then they took him out, took 
him back to the Œ to the 
camp, to 
Dachau
. But they just Œ just 
told him to put him in 
in there to grind him 
around a little bit. Then wa Œ there was a 
German Œ there was a German who used Œ 
what do you call these big machines? The cranes. He was digging ground in there, 
and he used to bake potatoes in
side that Œ they Œ they used 
to have coal in there, he 
used to bake potatoes. He 
would always have a full load
ed oven with potatoes. And 
we Œ if we get a chance, we ran over to him,
 he would give us four or five potatoes. 
It was like a steak, it was great. Hot, it wa
s just burning, it was just beautiful. He 
told me once, he says, if they catch me, I hope the

don™t report me to Œ to the Œ

the higher authority, otherwise I™m no Œ I™m 
going to  be punished . But the Œ a lot of 
the
 SS
 knew about it, they saw us doing it, y
ou know, they saw what we™re doing. 
There was a Œ on the also, ag Œ not far away
 was a Œ was a garden of vegetables and 
so on. I remember we ran over there, brea
k through th e wire and we stole that. We 

kept on eating it while we were there. The 
minute we brought it in
 to Œ to the other 
prisoners, it was gone. In a minute, it was Œ 
it was gone, they tore at you, they kill 
you for a piece of bread. So th
en, from there I was very weak
 and I said to myself, I 
got to ta Œ I™m Œ I™m never going to surv
iv e. I™ve got no energy and I cannot carry 
that cement. And I see where also some of
 the weak guy Œ people, they bring them 
in from work, put them in 
a death barrack. Still alive.
 No doctors, no nothing, no 
medicines. You Œ you cannot wo rk, or your 
Œ something happens to
 you, there™s the 
death barrack, that™s your medici

Q: They didn™t kill them ther

A: Let them die. Let them die. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: That™s exactly what 
happened . So one day I cam

saw, oh maybe ab out 40 or 50 bodies. He
 was hanging with his head down  and 
actually li Œ looking at us that he is stil l alive. He was Œ he was upside-down like 

this. We couldn™t go too close because it wa
s typhus in there. Everywhere you went 
in was a dangers you would pick up so meth

I said to myself, I Œ that could be me next
. I was Œ I was ready to cry and then I said 

to myself, oh no I better don™t cry, I ma
y be here tomorrow. I decided that I™m 

going to  steal some potatoes. It wasn™t t
oo far away from a bunker, because I ca Œ I 
didn™t want to die, I wanted to live. On
e morning I went to the bunker. I tied up my 
pajamas, my Œ my Œ my unif
orm on the bottom and I went
 in the bunker, I filled up 
my  pants full of potatoes. Some other 
p-prisoners encouraged me to do it too 
because they were going to give me a pi

 were going to buy 
some butter for that. So I Œ 
Q: Oh, you were bartering

A: Potatoes for something else, yeah, like a

cannot even  run, but I™m Œ I™m robbing th e potatoes, so I™m 
looking like this, loaded. And I se Œ run in
to the second row and I™m standing, you 
know, attention. Everybody
 came out, the commander officer a-asked, count the 
men again, in your barrack. They  co unte
d, ev erybody was there. The commanding 

officer says, who just came in? Was quiet. 
He started with again Œ who just came 
in? The prisoner next to me pointed  a finge

heavy piece of wood, put me on th ere, tied up my  hands in a bracket o-over my  
head, and my knees to a bracket. 
[indecipherable]
 I rememb er he kept on pounding 
on me with some kind of a heavy piece of
 wood, or a two by four. I remember 
screaming. I remember screaming, and that
™s about all. I don™t remember any more. 

I woke up Œ I woke up in a Œ in a doghou
se. I was Œ I woke up in a doghouse. I was 
crammed in with tw o other prisoners, one
 was dead and one was mo aning. I don™t 
know how many days I was in there, beca
use I was out, passed out. And one of the 
officers was Œ was inspecting Œ one of the 
officers was inspec
ting th-th-the Œ the 
camp and he came Œ wh en he went by there, 
he heard the mo aning, he asked, who is 
in there, to open up. He saw us in there, 
gave him one look with my eyes can hardly 
open up, he says, let the ma Œ let the pr
isoners loose. I don™t 
know, first time, you 
know, so that they carried me in. I don™t 
know wi Œ th e other prisoners, what they 

did with them, but they carri
ed me into my barrack. I 
couldn™t walk because my 
back was all messed up. And the reason why 
they did that, because the officer gave 
the orders. Otherwise so they
 would put me in the ba Œ 
in the death barrack. They 
took me into the barrack an
d they told me I™ve got two days to recuperate and I 
have to go to work
. In the meantime I asked for Œ from the 
Lagerfuhrers Œ
 I mean, 
the camp l-leader for some fo
od. He said, I™ll give you so
me food. Did you get your 
Œ your piece of bread ev ery day, and you 
know, at night time soup? I said, no, I

didn™t get nothing. I didn™t get since I was 
there. He says, you were there eight days 
and y-you didn™t get nothing?
 He says, go to the shl Œ 
Lagerschreiber.
 The 
Lagerschreiber
 was the accountant who let in Œ who ope Œ wh en  you opened up 
the gate, he counted the people coming 
in and going out. He made sure that 
everybody Œ that™s whats the Œ the Œ the 
Schreiber
, the 
Lagerschreiber
. And he Œ 
he told me to ask Œ he gave me my Œ my
 bread, everything, I 
should go and ask him 
for it. I went over and asked him for it, 
he came downstairs from his Œ from his 
booth upstairs and he came over and I told  
him what my barrack leader said. He got 
ahold of me like this, gave me a bloody mo
uth. I came back with  a bleeding mouth. 

I went back and told  Œ I told th-the Œ the 
lead Œ the ba Œ barrack leader what Œ what 
I got. He says, well I don™t know
 what Œ what to tell you, but
 I™ll try to help you. I™ll 
give you some of the barrels to lick out 
after Œ they were wo
oden barrels of soup. 
After everybody has the soup, I™ll give you
 to lick out the barrels. So I rememb er 
for a couple of days I kept on licking out 
the barrels. Spin Œ spin
 of Œ some of the 
wood would come off, you kno
w, splinters, and I would ju
st eat it like bread, I Œ 
like food, I didn™t even Œ I 
just swallowed everything 
what came in . And I got Œ

A: Because he ate Œ he sold it for Œ for 
cigarettes, the guy up on th-the scharl Œ 
Lagerschreiber. 
He did something with it. He Œ be Œ maybe he ate it, he sold it for 
cigarettes. 
Q: So how long were you in Œ 
A: 
Landsberg
? 
Q: 
Landsberg
, yeah. 
A: Yeah, okay. From there I was Œ I was told
 that I have ki Œ if I cannot go to  wo rk, 
some of the prisoners told me, if I go on a 
pa Œ role call, to stand straight, because 
they™re Œ they™re expecting Œ a couple da
ys later, that one of the days they™re 
expecting a health inspector. So, I was st
anding straight, but 
of Œ of course, I 
couldn™t move my  arm, I was sideways. An
d I was worried that if they get Œ the 
inspector sees me , I™m going to  Œ either he
™s going to  say I™m not Œ no mo re good to  
work , they™re going to put 
me into the death barrack
. But luckily there was no 
inspection th at day. But they asked for 
volunteers. They asked for volunteers and 
we went to dig trench es
 for Œ for the German 
SS
 in the forest. We fix ed the streets 
and so on. 

Q: In
 La ndsberg
? 
A: In la Œ in 
La ndsberg .
 Then we Œ they asked Œ the next day th ey asked ag ain for 
volunteers, something else. I always hope
 there™s going to be better days. If I

volunteer maybe I™ll get a better treatment 
or mo re food. I always hope fo r better, 
but I Œ I always gambled, and I was never Œ 
never had any lu ck. This time we Œ they 
took a transport, oh about, I Œ I Œ tw o, th
ree truckloads. And we 
Œ they took us to 
Landshut
 camp. 
Landshut 
camp was a Œ a German amm
unition place, they storage 
ammunition. They emptied out a few of th
e blocks Œ a few of the barracks they 
emptied out and they put in some of the pris
oners in air Œ he Œ in case the American 
bombs Œ bombers bombed that area, they blow
 up, we™re going to get blown up in it 
too. In the meantime, the 
SS
 were there with their a
mmu nition and we were there 
working also. We were at there, or we were
 at work. So we were
 taking by truck to 
a railroad s-sta Œ we were taking by truc
ks, not knowing where we were gonna go. 
Here we™re traveling through the forest Œ 

Q: That was from
 Landsberg
 to Œ 
A: To
 Landshut. 
It™s a 
La ndshut
 camp, yeah. It wasn™t too far away, but it™s called 
Landshut
 camp. Then we went down to, by tr
uck, two truckloads
 went down to Œ 
through the forest, we didn
™t know where we were going. We asked the Œ the 
SS
, 
where are we Œ wh ere are you taking us? They
 didn™t say where, they  said, it™s none 
of your business. So we just Œ we were 
quiet and we were Œ th
-they didn't  hear a 
whisper. We go through diffe
rent dark places and he
re is Œ we were just 
shooking
 
up, with Œ they™re probably 
going to kill us someplace. 
We came a little closer, we 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

54
see smoke going up. Uh-oh, th ere is the ch
imneys and there™s Œ there is another 
place where they kill people. We finally 
came, after 45 minutes or so, we ca Œ 
finally came to a place where there was Œ 
you could see civilians, homes, displayed 
stores. My God, we felt the Œ already relieve
d, oh, they™re not going to kill us, we Œ 
there™s something different he
re, w-we Œ we see it Œ I haven™t seen a Œ a woman for 
Œ for over a year. And here is a Œ I am st
aring at them, it™s a ma Œ it™s a pleasure. 
Then  suddenly we™re cross Œ crossing over 
railroad tracks and we are Œ as we 

crawled over railroad tracks we see smoke 
coming up. Right away  we thought, well, 
th-this is something different. We™re pr
obably going to  wo rk here because they 
bombed Œ th-the trains are all bomb ed a
ll over, smashed up railroad tracks. As we 
walked Œ we got out from the trucks. We wa
lked towards the dire
ction of where that 
bombing was. We saw aftr Œ a freight car op
en ed up, one of the 
boxcars, spill e d  out 
white powder. We didn™t know what it was 
at that time. B u t we walked in that 
direction, and it was smoldering, that white
 powder. Then suddenl
y one of the guys, 
some of the guys started to smell like Œ 
they said it Œ they said it™s burning sugar. 
Just like that, they se Œ they
 said burning sugar. And there 
all of us, all the prisoners 
just started to run on that direction. 
We were falling on our faces. We kept on 
running and running and ru nning. And we 
got there and sure enough, it was sugar. 
We kept on grabbing in 
handfuls hot sugar. I rememb
er grabbing hands, boiling 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

55
sugar, we just kept on shoving it in. My
 mouth was burning and my  hands were 
peeling off, I just kept on sh oving it in, and the 
SS
 were pounding on our heads with 
their Œ their rifle butts because we were
 eating the sugar. This time at least Œ 
Q: What exactly happen
ed? You were taken to 
Landshut
 camp to work, and there 
was a bombing Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ that bombed that train and Œ 
A: That™s right, they needed to
 clean up, they 
needed work.  
Q: Ah, I see. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: They needed to
 clean up that Œ 
A: Sure. 
Q: Œ that 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: That™s where they always used us, for 
places where they need
ed work, slavery.  
Q: And that™s where yo
u Œ you got the sugar. 
A: That™s right, we got the sugar, it felt 
so great. Even so , the Œ the par Œ the
 SS
 
were pounding on our heads. 
Th-T h-Th Œ mo st of the time they pe Œ beat us for 
nothing. This time they beat us, at least 
we enjoyed something. So  it felt good, but 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

56
then we worked there, yo
u know, tur-turning over th-the
 railroad cars and cleaning 
up th e mess. Then  we went ba
ck there again, and we wo
rk ed on th e railroad tracks. 
Q: And where did you sleep in Œ at night? 
A: At night we went back to the camp. 
Q: To
 Landshut
? 
A: To Œ to 
Landshut
 camp, yes, 
Landshut
 camp. 
Q: Uh-huh. How far was that from 
Landsberg? 
A: Oh, ab out an
 hour drive.  
Q: An hour. 

A: Ab-About an hour 
drive from there. 
Q: So how long were you in  
La ndsberg
? 
A: In
 La ndsberg
, about th-three, four weeks. 
Q: Three, four weeks. 

A: That™s all. 
Q: And in 
Landshut? 
A: 
Landshut
? Oh, I don™t know, the Œ

about three weeks, because th-th Œ 
let me just ke Œ go back again Œ 
Q: Sure. 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

A: Œ because that™s something interesti
ng. One day wh ile we were work ing, the 
sirens were going, the American
 bombers came. They ri Œ the 
SS
 told us to run and 
the soldier ran Œ ru-run into
 the forest. We ran into th
e forest, a few minutes later 
we see the American bombers diving. We 
could see the bombs falling and we are so 
happy we are gonna be free by the Amer
icans. We didn™t even know who the 
Americans were, but we were Œ we were 
happy ab out it. Then  there was another 

time we came out to work , this same thing happened, the American bombers are 
again there. This time they™re blowing up
 the railroad tracks. Everywhere you go 
they™re blowing the Œ everything is on fire. 
You don™t see a soul no place. After it 
was first finished, it was quieted down, some
 of the prisoners started to walk  around 
as, you know, walked  around to  see what™s 
happening. As we wa
lked through Œ we 
came over a Œ we walk ed over a railroad bri
dge, and on the left hand side there was 
about 24 small planes. The American bombe
rs Œ we still watched how the American 
bombers were using that 44 machine gun, I 
don™t know what they
 call it, but they 
were machine gunning the Œ th-the gas tanks
 and blowing up all the Œ all Œ all th ose 
planes. I would Œ kept on watching th
em, how they were blowing up like Œ 
Q: Which planes, the German planes? 
A: The German planes, they were poppin
g up like Œ like popcorn, they were just 
blown up right after one another.

Q: What time of year was it, do you rememb er? 
A: It was sometimes in April? 

Q: ™45? 
A: Yeah, ™45, April ™45. And then we went
 back to our truck, our truck was blown 
up to pieces. Our truck wasn™t there, so we
 didn™t know what 
to do. A lot of the 
prisoners escaped. I was afraid to make th
e escape, I could have escaped too, but I 
was afraid. I was afraid  because of being 
beaten and I couldn™t take no mo re pain, 
because I still felt the pain in
 my head from the lead pipe 
and beating all the time at 
work. So I was afraid, I didn™t want Œ want
 to gamb le. We finally got a truck, we 
came back. Here we Œ we are going Œ the ne
xt day we went out to wo rk to  build 
agai Œ to dig again branches for the Germ
an soldiers. We are not getting any mo re 
food, it™s already three or four days, we™re
 not getting no food, we
 didn™t go to work  
no place. We see the Germans are removing 
out their ammunition,
 we watch Œ were 
watching them taking it out. 
Q: So th ere was no supervision any mo re Œ 
A: N-N Œ oh yes, the commanding officer 
wasn™t there, no, the commanding officer 
wasn™t there, but he was still in charge. Wh
en  we went out Œ wh en
 we went out to Œ 
to dig th e trenches, he would co me out w
ith his motorcycle to inspect. He would 

bring along a 15 foot white, long whip  like 
you train animals and he would wh ip us 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

59
from Œ from far away he would flip Œ whip
 us. But I Œ I Œ I remember I couldn™t 
work too much because
 of my shoulder and I kept 
on Œ the minute I saw the Œ the 
whip  coming, I bent down  and you know, 
I felt sorry for the taller p risoner who got 
hit. But he would ju st take it out on the 
prisoners because they were losing the war. 
After awhile Œ nek Œ it would 
Œ didn™t take too long, we 
see the bomb s are flying, it 
di Œ it lights up the skies, artillery , it™s goi
ng crazy. It Œ sudden
ly, we were ordered 
next day to march to the railroad sta
tion. We came to the railroad station Œ 
Q: The railroad station in 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Y-Y-Yes, 
La ndshut™s 
rail station. They  loaded us 
in in Œ in boxcars. We didn™t 
know wh ere we were going. They  closed up
 the doors. We are Œ as we made Œ we 
came Œ we dro Œ traveled about 25 minut
es, the train stopped ag ain to let go by a 
German train loaded with ammunition and 
Œ and artillery, everything is loaded. You 
could see their Œ their faces are sad, they
 Œ they Œ they know
 that s-something™s 
wrong and they don™t like to go the Œ thos
e places. But the Œ one of the locomotive 
at that station went in to 
got some water. After he left, I was a may Œ maybe about a 
one of Œ and a half car away from Œ from 
that spout, and th ere was another sp Œ 
prisoner also with me. And I Œ I said to 
my self, boy it would be nice if I could go 
over and take a bath inside the tank, or just
 take a good drink of water. So after he 
left, I ran over and that other guy, the ot
her prisoner ran over 
too, were holding up 

 
Interview with Irving Schaffer

60
our ma Œ hands to the drip, the drip s were
 coming in. And it felt so good to have a 
couple drops of water, it felt great. And the 
SS
 were chasing us b
ack to our Œ to our 
freight car Œ to our cars. So I didn™t Œ but
 our guard  was helpfu
l. Then we took off 
again. We k-kept on going for maybe a
nother 35 Œ 40 minutes on the train and 
suddenly  we are sh Œ moved in , and th e train made a sudden stop. We didn™t know 
what happened, whether it wa
s a Œ just everybody was falling on top of another. 
Before it if Œ if Œ in a few seconds later 
we hear the bombers are diving in, bombing 
our train. The American bombed our trai
n by mistake. They knocked out lik Œ 

locomotives, a lot of the pers Œ a lot of 
casualties were there. And after the first 
time, they came back the s
econd time, some of the pr
isoners threw their stripe 
unifo rms on top of the Œ of the Œ of the box
cars. When they came 
back they turned 
around and took off. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But the Œ we found out that one of the 
trains, German trains that was chasing a 
German art-artillery train and 
he Œ they went by 
and they got us by
 mistake. That™s 
what we were told. But anyway Œ 

Q: Did you try to run 
away during that time? 
A: Well, no, I didn™t, but maybe somebody
 else did. I was afraid. I was afraid 
because I wanted to come back alive, I Œ 
my father™s Œ I wanted to see my father

again and I had also hope that some of 
my family would sur 
Œ surviv ed. We took o 
Œ tha-that train was out of commission, we 
couldn™t go no place. Everything was a Œ 
had a Œ we were just waiting. The
 SS
 didn™t know what to 
do with Œ with us. The 
commanding officer is gone. We were just 
sitting in front of the freight cars and 
talking. It came later in  the afternoon, the 
SS 
commander Œ officer comes to me, he 
says 
[indecipherable]
 boutonnière and with  his 
[indecipherable]
 in his hand, and 
he said Œ oh, no, the 
SS 
hollered, oh, ev erybody I Œ in 
attention. Everybody th  Œ is 
at Œ is at attention, and we™re shaking fr
om fear because he would only come when 
Œ when there are bad times, when someth
ing Œ somebody did something wrong or 

he™s going to  do something bad. He says
, you are a-all liberated, you are free to do 
wherever you want. Oh  my  God, are you 
su re? You heed  a Œ he-h eard wa Œ you 
heard a you sure and everybody started to
 run over the railroad tracks, and wh eat 

field, corn field. I remember running w
ith a few other prisoners over the railroad 

tracks and we ran into wheat
 fields and cornfields and while we™re running, I see 
some other ama Œ prisoners who are runnin
g with me are falling down. I said run, 

run 
[indecipherable]
, but they  Œ th ey didn™t get up, another fell, another one fell. 
And ga Œ they didn™t get up. I just kept 
on running, I said to myself, maybe they™re 
weak, they  cannot get up. I kept on running
. I saw a sign while I was running, I saw 
a sign 
[indecipherable]
 and then  I saw a big build ing in there. I ran towards the

direction. I came in to Œ toward that build
ing, there was a little delicatessen in there. 
I ran in the side of delicatessen, the owner 
over the counter got ahold four slices of 
white bread and gave it to me. I sq uashed 
it together like a Œ like a piece of ball and 
I just shoved it down , I could hardly 
swallow it, but I Œ it went down.  
Q: You were still with your prisoners uniform? 

A: Oh yes, prisoner™s unifo rm, yes a Œ my  skin was coming off for Œ from dirt. We 

never got a Œ took a shower or anything. Th
ere wasn™t enough water to drink. Lice 
crawling on Œ on our lower Œ black, everything 
was black. So  he Œ he Œ he gave me 
another tats Œ he turn ed  around and ga
ve me another one. Two guys are sipping 
their coffee and talking and they ™re looki
ng at me like a Œ somebody Œ a wild 
animal walked in in here, th
-th-th-they couldn™t see me Œ 
Q: They were German? 

A: Germans, yeah. So all of a sudden I h
ear ooh hoo, ooh hoo,

th-the he Œ the German over the counter 
says,

(ph) he says, run into the barn an
-and cover yourself up with straw. 
The two men got up from the Œ from the 
Œ who were sipping coffee and came 

outside and showed  me which way to go, th
at was about 150 feet away. I ran Œ and 
ran inside fast, cover my self up with hay. 
It didn™t take mo re than a few seconds, I 

hear

Come on out or I™ll kill you.

There were Œ he asked for one of the 
SS 
to  go over in that direction, pound with a

another prisoner with th e hay fork. 

Q: Oh yeah, there were more

A: No, I didn™t know at that time. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Yeah, I didn™t know, it was just Œ ther

they told  me to. So they  
pounded in  that area there a

scream. And then I jumped up, and I saw an
other je Œ prisoner ju
mp ed up. We went 
outside with a ho Œ handl
e Œ hi Œ hand up, the 
SS
 is right behind our back with their 
bayonets, and we marched out the doo
r. I see outside the door there™s a 
Jeep
 and the 
commanding officer motorcyc

Jeep
. The commanding officer gave orders for the two 
SS
 to go back to their post, 
and while he was talking to 
them, the-the Œ one of the Œ 
the prisoner who was with 
me, helding his head up high,
 he started to run. The
 SS
 officer grabbed his gun and 
shot him maybe about 10 feet away  from Œ 
from him. And th en he Œ after the two

his gun in th e left hand and he
 hollered at me, he says, run. 
[speaks German]

says, run. If you cannot run I™m
 going to kill you. I starte

was weak, I couldn™t run, I kept on beg Œ 
I kept on falling. He coo Œ he would cock 
his gun, I ta Œ I begged him please, I have 
to meet my  father again, I cannot die yet. 
He s Œ kept on running, I ke Œ I kept

give up, I kept on fighting 
to stay alive, begging him 
while I was out a Œ with Œ without a breat

mo torcycle, but he just kept on pushing 
me and Œ and then he stops and co cks his 
gun ready to fire at my  head and I just 
kept get up and kept on going again. We 
finally came to the same place where we ha

some more of the vitamins. I 
told him I felt a lot better 
from it, and he says, oh we 
ran out of, we don™t have them no mo re. 
And he says, we™ll take out the bandage

Munich,
 which it wa Œ wasn™t too far away. 
But I started to ask around where 
Œ wh ere I could get some Œ to find out if anybody of my family was alive. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I knew that last time Œ a-all my
 fami ly went ex cept my  older brother was 
still living and it Œ I di
dn™t know he was in the labor ca
mp, and my sister I saw last 
at Œ when  I waved to her and I got hit with a lead pipe in 
Auschwitz
. So I was 
hoping both these two had surv ived, but 
u-unfortunately no matter how much I 
tried, I did not Œ I did not find my sist
er, but I, after awhile, investigating and 
chasing around, I found out that my  brot
her, my  older brother was captured in the 
Russian prison, surv ived and he is waiting for me in 
Cze choslovakia
, 
Chust.
 So, 
when I told that to some my
 friends in there, they to
ld  me not to go because I™ll 
never come back again, because 
Russia
 wouldn™t let you out. You™ll Œ you™ll be 
able to get in, but not to Œ 
you™ll not be able to get out.
 I said to myself, I went 
through hell in the concentration camps, I 
was locked up, I wasn
™t allowed to go, I 
was Œ no place, I was g u ardedevery minute with Œ by the 
SS
 with rifles, and then I 
was starving. Today, thanks God I am not st
arving and I had Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I cannot do 
that, I got to meet my brother. So I ju
st went ahead and tried to make an

transportation was terrible.

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So we had to wait. So I 
Œ when  I started out, I finally got a pass with my  picture 
that I can travel, or Œ to Œ to 
Russia
. And I traveled through fr Œ two freight trains 
and then  Œ then other trains
 and they were loaded. Some
 people were returning and 
soldiers from the army , they were all broke
n up too, and they were lonely , lost from 
the world. I Œ I finally made it to Œ to 
Czechoslovakia
.  
Q: You got back to 
Chust
? 
A: To
 Chust
, I finally made it to 
Chust.  
Q: Did you meet Œ did you find an
y memb ers of your family there? 
A: No. I might Œ I was waiting for my brot
her, I was supposed to meet my brother, 
my  brother ta Œ wrote Œ left me a message th
at he™s gonna be back
 in two days, he™s 
outta Œ he went Œ had to le
ave out of town , I guess for business already. So  he Œ I 
waited there. In the meantime I went back to see our 
home. The home was there, 
but all Œ I went back to the Jewish nei
ghborhoods, there™s nobo
dy there, everything 
Œ there™s no mo re minyan, there™s no mo re

to work for one of the 
spiritus

alcohol, the rubbing alcohol. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And this one guy, was a heavy, tall-se

had a Hungarian wife. With him I could ge
t along, he was pretty le Œ easy Œ 
easygoing. His wife was a real anti-Sem
ite. She was a Hungarian but she hated 
Jews. I had nothing to do with her. But I 
Œ I Œ I decided Œ I knew where he lived, I 
decided I™ll wait for him near a bridge. He
 usually walked , because he never drove, 
he was too heavy to get into a car. He ne
ver drove a car, never knew how to drive. 
So I waited for him at a bridge, and I got 
closer to him as I™m comin g , I™d smile 
[speaks foreign language]
 and he was an Œ he gar Œ 
grab s his Œ he was going with 
a cane, he grabs his cane and swung it at me
. He says, you dirty Jew, get away from 

here. Well, he was ready to kill me, you coul
d see that face, he 
was Œ you dirty Jew, 
get away from here. I wa Œ I started to cr
y, I was Œ I couldn™t believe what this guy 

called me and how ma Œ how Œ how he chan
ged overnight, how Œ wh at happened to 
this guy? The hatred in him. He 
had a friend, a teacher by the name 
Mandbattel
(ph), he used to come over Œ he used
 to Œ he Œ he used to come over 
after school and spend time with him dr
inking what kind, having good times,

laughing. And I thought he™s Œ he™s a mensch, 
but it turned out to be
 that he tur Œ he 
changed unbelievable. So I 
finally went Œ lo oked fo r a place where to sleep and 
someone told me where the survivors are mee
ting, so I went to that hotel and I was 
tra Œ hoping my  brother is going to show up
. A couple days late
r I met some of the 
people in there, but most of them were
 s Œ from small towns. There were two or 
three from my city, but most of them we
re from small towns who survived. And 
finally my  brother came a couple days late
r and we went Œ we 
decided Œ we heard 
that we must leave 
Czechoslovakia
 because the Russians are closin g the borders. 
So we had to  hurry up 
and get out from there.

A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Where did you from there? 

A: We Œ first my  brother suggested we 
should try to sell our house, to see if

bayonet. He told him, if you ever come 
back I™m gonna wait for you next time with 
a bayonet, I™ll blow your head o
ff. He started to run, he said, 
It zhak
, run, run, run 
for your life. I kept on running, running an
d I Œ wh en he told me that I couldn™t 
believe it. I couldn™t believe it, I was cr
ying and I was so bitter about it. There is 
nothing we have got here, we 
gotta get out of here, this is the hateful place that I Œ 
that Œ that Œ th Œ if you Œ they found out 
I™m Jewish I survived, 
they™re going to kill 
me too. So we ran to th e small gas Œ to small Œ there we had two big stations, one a 

small one, one a big one. From wh ere Œ we™re cl Œ we were closer to the small 
station. So we got back there and we we
re sitting waiting for a train, you never 
knew when a train is g o nna come, two, three 
hours, four or five 
hours. It was about 
one or two o™clock in the morning, 
we are waiting still. There were some 
FBI
 
agents, you know, 
like, they™re not 
FBI,

A: Yeah, they were watching ev erything a

came and checked out everybody who was waiting at the station there, their 
passports. Everybody™s was fine, my  brothe

ke Œ prisoner, he was free now. 
But I was Œ I got papers from 
Germany
, and I w-
was born in 
Czechoslovakia
. The papers said I was born in 
Czechoslovakia
,
 
Chust.
 They called me in inside 
and th-th-th-the little ro om in
 there, at that station 
and this one 
NKVD™er
(ph) tells me, he says, you were
 born here, your papers said 
you were born in 
Chust,
 
Czechoslovakia
, this is where you belong. You™re not 
leaving th is place. This is your country, your 
home. I said to him, 
I have to meet my 
family if somebod
y survived in 
Germany
, I have to go there. Maybe later on I™ll 
come back after I™m 
finished. He says no, you can
not go no place, you Œ I™m sorry, 
you gotta stay here, that™s your home. Suddenly wh ile 
were ti Œ I™m arguing with 
him and I™m ra Œ crying, he 
Œ suddenly we heard some shoo
ting outside, fire Œ they 
were shooting, gunfire. He
 started run out, I ran afte
r him.  And the minute I ran 
after him I s-s-saw my  brothe
r, I said Œ I told my brothe
r, run for your life, let™s go 
to the big station. We took
 off, ran ou Œ toward the big 
station. We tripped, we Œ 
maybe took us a half an hour, 45 minutes to
 get there. We tripped all o-on Œ on 
railroad ties, we fell in  chuckholes. We 
Œ we came bloodied up to  the big station 
with our knees, but we finally made it. He
re w e™re waiting in there for th Œ for the 
train didn™t come yet and we are hoping th at
 there™s going to be ro om on it because 
most of the time the trains were Œ came 
in so loaded, people 
are hanging onto the 
steps, they were standing on the steps, 
they couldn™t get on. So I finally Œ we Œ

77
finally the train came, we got in, we coul
dn™t get on. So everybody was climbing on 
top of the roof, so we Œ I rememb er I Œ 
I ran from one place, it was dark, it was after 
midnight, two or three o™clock in the mo rn
ing. I ran from one place to another and I 
finally saw some people are trying to help 
one another to get up. I figured I™ll Œ I™ll 
get up too. They  help ed me to get up to  th
e top of the ro of. On top of the roof you 
were pretty safe, but when the Russians ca
me  up th ere to ask you for money or Œ or 
Œ or th-they™re gonna kill you fo r watche
s, you had to give
 Œ you Œ th ere was 
tsoris
. 
There were problems. And I Œ a-anyway
, th e train started to move. Every Œ 
Q: And where did it go to? 
A: Everything was fine, we 
Œ we were on our way going 
back  to Œ I was supposed 
to go back to 
Germany
. I said, I don™t have for a pa
ss, I™m gone Œ the pa Œ I know 
my pass is gone, I don™t have nothing. They
 Œ he too Œ th-the ci
vilian took away my 
pass. We are coming to the small station, 
the train starts out, and it™s going Œ my 
heart is feeling ba Œ faster and faster, I h
ear the train is going and I said to myself, 
boy if Œ if we stop at that station, the small one wh ere Œ where we Œ we were 

waiting, we ran away from, and th Œ 
th-that civilian is waiting for me, the 
NKVD
 is 
waiting for me, I™ ll be i n  trouble, they™re 
gonna take me off. It is dar k , but I wen Œ

A: Anyway, we got Œ we got Œ we g-got Œ ca
me closer by and the train just flew Œ 
just went by, wh istled loud and went by,
 didn™t stop because there was no ro om no 
place, every seat was taken. I thank God, 
my God, I™m safe, I got Œ I fooled them, 
I™m out of Œ from 
Chust,
 I™m out of it. So we finally, on the way going, the Œ y-you 
could see th-the Œ th e Œ some of the p Œ so
me of the people would stand up an d the 
electric wires, or telephone wire were Œ we
re across, and if you got up too high fro 
Œ on top of the roof, you were just picked
 up by the wire a
nd you™re knocked off. 
Next to us that happened 
to one of the guys. He got 
up to change places with 
somebody else. He didn™t lower his head en-eno
ugh, or he just came Œ he picked his 
head up and Œ he picked himself up ju st in 
time, when he came near the wire and he 
got blown off from the Œ from the train.  
Q: How long did the trip to 
Germany
 take? 
A: Oh, I Œ I don™t know. We had to transfer to Œ several times to Œ 
Debrecen
 we 
stopped once, and then  we had to travel a
nother one and then we came to che Œ to 
Prague. 
Then Œ then  we Œ the Œ there Œ there was Œ it depends wh at kind of a train 
we took. Sometimes we had 
to go on our circuits ar

police Œ police and what they did, they wo
uldn™t come back no more to our camp, 
so we had to organ Œ they had to  orga
nize our own police force. Because I had 
training six weeks, I became a member of 
the police force. I was guarding with a Œ 
four other guys, one night we 
were guarding in Œ near a forest with s-some other per 
Œ survivors and we were un Œ in a bunke

A: I think th e second World War did not do 
the Œ so much damage to the wo rld than 
it did to the Jewish people. The wo rld did 
not lift a finger to help for the Jewish 
people. The 
United State 
did not want to bomb  
Auschwitz
 for a reason. They were 
around, they couldn™t. There was wide open
 spaces, they could just go ahead that 
little place and bomb it and they 
could have saved 
millions of Jews, but they didn™t 
care, they didn™t want to. 
Roosevelt
 didn™t care. They p Œ a lot of people asked him. 
There was one a-ambassador, a Polish went 
to him and he told th em, he says, 
they™re killing Jews, innocent people, he sh
owed him what™s happening. He says, 
we™re busy fighting a war, we ha
