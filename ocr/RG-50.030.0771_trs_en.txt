The French fleet had been ta

 we™d 
go like we were going to bomb

then we™d just veer away.

 one day Œ we didn™t know

 where the troops would gath er for

and then , one night, wh ile we were bombing,
 we were bombing an airfield, and we 
Œ we came in at low level, and I remember
 we always had machine guns we were 
firing. And there was a man running. And 
I remember I grabbed that Œ the machine 
gun just as tight as I could, and I was Œ 
I was gonna kill the bastard. And so he was 
running, and I don™t know if we hit him,

pulled off, I Œ I Œ I clenching Œ I was still cl

But I was Œ I was determined

I wasn™t made that way. 
Q: That sound Œ kind of shocked you 
about yourself at that moment, huh? 
A: Yeah. And then there was another th

German army  was bringing su pplies down 
from Œ from the bavar 
Œ I mean, from the 
pass, and from Œ there was a little town called 
Udinay
(ph)
 
and there was a bunch of 
rail lines, and it was a Œ I rememb er it was 
May, and it was a beautiful Sunday. And 
so, it was Œ but we knew that the Œ the rail 
lin es there merged, and there was a lot of 
boxcars full of ammunition. So  we went after them. So, I was photographing that 

day, and we let go our bombs, and boy there 
were secondary and tertiary explosions

again. So  we photographed it again, cause 
we were lead, and we went
 back  and photographed it ag
ain and bis Œ it was still 
explosions all over the place. 
So when  we got back to  th

really plastered those bastards
 today, or we Œ we got th

next mo rning we had a briefing how many
 locomotives we ha

boxcars we had hit. And Œ and 
so you felt real good, and th
en they finally said yeah, 
but 2,000 slave laborers were 
killed. They were in the Œ 
and that was another thing 
that stuck with me, that™s Œ that™s has al

when  Œ th ank you Œ wh en the 
photos were released, there was the reaction of, this 
proves what we Œ this proves that this 
actually happened. And for a lot of people, 
especially 
Auschwitz
 survivors, there really 
weren™t a lot of photos of 
Auschwitz
 
taken during the war, so it really was proo
f that Œ in-incredible proof that people 
could point to, it was all over the news. It
 also started a debate among historians, 
which you know, and 
you and I have talked about,
 and you™ve written about it, 
about whether or not 
Auschwitz
, the crematoriums and gas chambers at 
Auschwitz
 
could have been bom

Ina 
have talked abou
t the intelligence 
aspects of that, how these photos were
n™t discovered until the 70s when you 
discovered them, and how at the time, th
e interpretation couldn™t have happened. 
You know, they didn™t have th
e intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be 
able to pin out what was the crematoriu
m, and wh at was the gas chambers and do 
those sorts of things. Bu t 
Ina

Auschwitz
 had been 
bombed, and so I wanted to Œ you to talk

k Œ and again, I know you™
ve written this, but I want 
you to say it on camera, so we have you 
on camera saying it; what you think the Œ 
say, 
McCoy
(ph) had said, yes, we should go 
ahead and do it. Wh at would have 
happened after that? Do es that ma ke sense? 
A: Yes. 

Q3: Is it a fair question. 
A: Yeah. 
Q3: Okay . 

A: Now I think Œ now, I was with an ou
tfit that we had Œ we took pleasure in 
pinpoint bombing. We Œ we knocked out br
i Œ we had a record for knocking out 
bridges, we had Œ we Œ we hit the ba
ttleship and cruiser. 
Whatever they had 
something 
[indecipherable]
 they Œ we could hit it. And Œ and medium bombers, 
they are much more accurate 
than the Œ than the heavies.  And I think it could have 
been bombed by medium. In fact, I would ha
ve volunteered on that type of mission. 
You could have moved 
B
 fif Œ 
B-25s
 into  position and 
B-25s
 could have got them, 
cause it Œ now, how long would it take them
 though to  Œ to reconstruct? I don™t 
think you can reconstruct one 
of those killing stations in say, six weeks. They Œ 
somebody said, well you can Œ oh
, we can build them in six weeks. But they  said,

well, the one guy said oh yeah, well, we can
™t Œ we can™t Œ we can™t gas them, but 
we™ll Œ we™ll u Œ we™ll kill them with rifl
es. Well, the Germans had found out that 
killing by Œ by rifles is Œ is pr
etty hard on the people that
 are doing the killing, too. 
So I Œ I Œ I think it Œ if Œ if Œ if it Œ if 
somebody said gets Œ get a Œ bomb  it, I think 
the medium 
L-2
 bomb ers would do it, 
B-25s
 especially. And Œ 
and our outfit would 
have been a good
 one to do it. 
Q3: Were Œ were medium bombers flying over

A: Well, let me tell you, wh en you 
release your bombs, 
normally you have 
something in  mind. You want to Œ they ca
ll them linear. You la Œ you drop them so 
that they Œ they™re pinpoint bombing in a 
l-long area. Or you salvo, you want them 
all to go one time. Now, one of the problems 
that they have is 
that when the bombs 
come out, when you Œ when 
you release the bombs and th
ey hit Œ hit the airflo w , 
they have a tendency sometime to fishbed,
 or sometime even to
 tundle Œ tumble.
