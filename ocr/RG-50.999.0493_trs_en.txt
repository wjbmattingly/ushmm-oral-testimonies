wom en's clothes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  
A  p re sse r, OK .  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yeah.  It musthave beena good trade,becausewe li ved very well. W e lived in 
Paris, and everything was successful, until the Germ ans disruptedthe whole thing.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littleabout your parents, besides their occupation. W hat do you know about 

their early years, before they were m arried? Your father, tellm eabout your f ather.  You had toldm e 
he didn't have much form al education.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hat's right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  But a very edu
cated m an.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Hespoke seven languages.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ow. 
 

>> Marcel Hodak:  He learned how to write him self . He camef rom ver y poorf amily.  His father was a 
rabbi, andm yf ather could read Hebrew and knew it by heart. W henwe went to the synagogue, he 
hadthe chantingf rom  the cantorand he could f ind itdirectly.  He knew the whole bookby heart.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W as your motherf luent in other languages?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  My m other,unfortunately, was not educatedat all.  She, just like all thepeople that 
cam ef rom  EasternEurope, didn't have an education. W omen did not go to school to learn anything.

>> Marcel Hodak: W ell, m y father
 -- 
well, theparents, they weren't together yet, were in Kishinev, 
which had oneof  thebiggest pogrom s in Europe.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Apogrom  was attacks andassaults on Jews.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hat's correct. W hat they called the cleansing oftheir cou
n try.  It wa s like  a  
drunkard type of thing,and any Jews that were in the way were beaten up, killed.  Didn't matter if  it 
was part of  the governm ent.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Asa result of that,they ended up going toT urkey?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey decided to go toT urkey.  My f atherm etm y m other,and they got m arried. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourm other, I believe, had15 siblings.

Af ter your parentsm oved,af terhaving individ ually with theirf am ilies gonef rom  Rom ania to

[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yeah.

[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  OK.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  I wasn't supposed tobethere.  
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: W ell, as you started off to tell us, their life inParis was generally a pretty good life.

Bill Benson:  OK. Of course, the war begins with Germ any's invasionof  Poland in September 
1939, but thefollowing spring, in the May of  1940, Nazi Germ any attacked what we of ten call the 
lowland countries in France.  So they m oved into France,occupiedaf ter attacking France in May 
1940, andParis becam e anoccupied city, where your parents remainedf or thenext two years, until 
1942.  
 
 
T ell us what you can about your circum stances in those two years li ving in occupied Paris, and 
what you know about the
 
invasionof  Paris.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  I rem ember

I was ver y young at that tim e,but Istill rem em ber that we had 
blackouts when therewere bom bings inParis.  I know that italways happened during dinner.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthe bombings would hap
pen?  
 

>> Marcel Hodak:  Yeah.  And the lights wereout. As we were sitting at dinner, and you couldn'teat 
anything, and I was hungr y, I would putout my hand to pickup a piece of bread, andI would get hit 
with  a  fo rk.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the dark?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  In the dark.  
 
[Laughter]
 
I don't know how m y f ather could have seen that I was grabbing thefood, but ithappened.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Som etim es you would endup having to go down in the subways as shelters?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  My mother one day was carr ying m e towards the subway, another air raid, 
andm y blanket was hit with a pieceof  shrapnel; burnt ahole inm y blanket, but nothing happened to

You were telling m e, thefirst time we m et, that the French were not
 
--
 
they were conf ident they 
couldholdoff theGerm ans, because they had this marginal line.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T he m arginal line was justa plain dream .T he only things that the German
s 
actually did was go around the line,then come behindthem . T hey captured a lotof  troops, one of  
which was oneof m y uncles.  Andhehad been wounded, andhef inally died of gangrene because 
they found out he was Jewish.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In aprisoner of war cam p.  Your parentsand siblings, your sister and two brothers, 

were stripped of their French citizenship, but you were not. W hy was that?  
 
>>
 
Marcel Hodak:  It'sver y possible that they looked atold information,and I was not included with 
thefam ily. W hatthe French were trying, becausethe French were really collaborationists, what the 
French were trying to say is that they're not killing any Jews, French Jews.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Nottheir own citizens.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W hen they tookaway our citizenship and made them non

French, so that we were 
ripe to getpicked up.

>> M a r c e l  H o

>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Exceptduring that time, we lef tandf ound ourselves in the south of France.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we turn to the south of France, in that two
-
year period while in occupied Paris, 
between 1940
-
42, what do you know about what your parents' life was like in that two
-
year period?

>> Marcel Hodak: W ell, if you saw m ovies or television shows on Molly Goldberg, it was m ore or less 
the same type of thing.  My parents knew all the neighbors andeverything, and they felt comf ortable.  
It was like anordinary life.  
 
 
In the beginning, the Germ ans didn't really do anything. T he French were the ones that set up 
the decree
 
totake away citi zenship.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So in the summ er of 1942, that's when yourf am ily l ef t Paris to go to Vichy, or as it 

was called, Free France.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littleabout what Free France really m eant,andm ore importantly what led to 
your parents'decisionto leave Paris to go toVichy, France?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  OK. W hathappened isthat around 1942, rumors startedflying around. W eheard 

about things happening to the Jews in othercountries.  My f atherheard thenews anddecided it was 
best if  we lef t the country, or went down south, because you couldn'tgo outof it.W e were lim ited on 
our travels.  Our French passporthad a Jonthere, saying that youwere Juif .  So we couldn't travel.  
But you could travel wi thin the country.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Including into Vichy, France? 
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  During 1942, that's when major round
-
upsof  Jews and deportations beganto 
happen.

>> Marcel Hodak:  A big round

up happened a m
onth after we had lef t Paris, where they picked up 
30,000 Jews f rom  Paris itself , andput them  in aplace calledValdevare.  It was a velodrom e where 
they practicedf or the Olym pics.  Ithada bicycle thing around it.  
 
 
Ou t of tha t gro u p tha tgo t p u t in to
 
Valdevare, 100 Jews, adults, were saved, where 4,115kids 
were actually killed, never cam e back.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat round

bef ore you left thatas the earlier deportations were beginning 
and the round

Jews would denounce Jews to get their apartm ents.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey would.  They would do that, to be able to get their goods.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T o get their goods.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  But the worst part was thepolice. Thepolice was completely collaborating with 

the Germans.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatyou called gendarme. It was French police?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T hey finally adm ittedthat.

Bill Benson:  Relativel y recently?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Marcel, your f am ily decidesto go toVichy.  They leave Paris. W hat towndo they go 
to, and why that town?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: W ell, they went till theendof  the line, where everybody got off the train. The town 
was called Montpuk. It's a f unny nam e, because when you're learning French it sounds like " My

[Laughter]
 
At any rate, they landed there

Marcel Hodak: T he people tried tof ind jobs.  My f atherfound a job asa lumberjack.  Imagine a 
personthat irons clothes became a lumberjack.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W as this afairly f orested area,m ountainous?

not have been able to even get near nail pol

>> Bill Benson:  As I recall, you toldm e that because he was of ten injured andhurting because of the 

work, that thef oremanwas som ewhat easy on him.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  Thef orem an,m oreor less, protected him , because when the Germ ans

st  
--
  
>> Marcel Hodak:  It was openhiding. W e weren't really hiding, in the sensethat in the cellars or 
anything. W hathappened isthat we acted like we were f rom the town.  I went to church,andan 
incident was I used to go to church with m y beret on, beretbeingmy hat.  Ididn't take it off , but the 
priest would com e,take off m y hat, put itonm y lap.  I didn't know wh y he did that, but I saw the other 
people withouthats, so I figuredm aybe I'm not supposed to wear a hat.  I cometof ind out later
 
on ,  
m y brother toldm e, that the priest was actually a Jew who was in the underground.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Am em berof the French resistance?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you say, you're sort of hiding in the open.  Youdidn't adopta dif

did you?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak: T he wom en did.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he wom en did, OK.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  My sister was nam ed Esther, and she eventually changed hernam e toEdit, or 
Edith. My cousin, who wrote a book on the wholefam ily, was named Rachel; she changed it to 
Dawn. W hy the women?  I guess they would get accostedby Germans andbeasked their nam es. 
So they changed them.  T hey gave their names, they would have known right away they were Jews.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said, your father was working as a lum berjack. W hatdid yourm other do 
during that time?

As you said, you wentto church, but you

did thef am ily f orm ally act like, though,the cover that you 
were Christian, or you just went to church?

I was theonly one that went, 
because it was the thing to do.  All the kids went to church.

Bill Benson:  Besides your father'sf orem an asa lum berjack, doyou think otherpeoplein this 
town, becauseI imagine it was nota big comm unity.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Not a big com munity.  Yes, they probably knew we were Jewish, andnobody gave 
us up. T hat town was also where the underground was permanent.If som ebody gave up an 
underground guy or one of the Jews in the town, there would be killings all over the place. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you saidtom e, it was a hotbed of the resistance.

>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jews were allowed to bepart of  the French resistance?  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Ofcourse. They were com munists; that's how they ended up. The com munists 

were the ones thatended upf ighting againstthe Germ ans.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So one of  the reasons why probably you weren't denounced, as you said, is because 

this was such a hotbed of the resistance.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Yes, sir.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas a form of  protectionf or allof  you.  
 
>> Marcel Hodak:  Forall of us, yes.  Although they did take afew people. T he Germ ans cam e into

andthat was the result.  I worked hardfor it.  I started off asa policeman, and I didn't like to be a 
policeman, especially since prom otionsare very rare.  You really can't get prom oted in thepolice, 
because they've got quotas.  And I don't likequotas anym ore.
