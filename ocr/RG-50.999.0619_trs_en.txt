Fred Flatow was bornSiegfried Friedel ErnstFlatow on May

T he arrow on this map of  Germ any in 1933 shows the location of Konigsberg in East 
P ru ssia .  

 
Here we see Fred'sparents, Erichand Malwi ne.T hey opened a rainwear f actory in 
1924 and also operated a sm allfur coat business startedby Fred'sgrandparents.
 
 
Fred had oneolderbrother, Manf red, born in1925. Here we see aphotograph of 
Fred on the lef t and Manfred on the right taken in1932.
 
 
Fred beganf irst grade at an all

Adolph Hitler cam etopower. Here we see Fred on hisf irstday of  schoolholding a conef illed 
with s weets, a Germ an traditionf or thef irstday of  school. He was the only Jewish boy in his 

class and his classm ates bullied him . His parents withdrew him  thenext year andenrolledhim  

in an all
-
Jewish school in Konigsberg.
 
 
On Novem ber
 
9, 1938, during Kristallnacht,or Night of  Broken Glass, the Gestapo 
arrestedand jailed450 Jewish m en in Konigsberg, including Fred'sfather,Erich. Erich was 

releasedf rom  jail afew days later.
 
T hisphoto shows thef am ily's s ynagogue inKonigsberg 
destroyed byf ire on Kristallnacht. Fred'sparents decided it was unsafe for their childrento 

rem ain in school inKonigsberg and sent them  to stay with
 
f am ily f riends in Ham burg, 
Germ any, where Fredenrolled in a Jewish school.
 
 
On thism ap of Germ any, the arrow on the left points to Hamburg and the arrow on 
the right points to Konigsberg.
 
 
In 1939, thefactory clerk betrayed Fred'sparents to Germ an authorities and they 
were f orced to surrender theirfactory. Erich was told to reportto theGestapoheadquartersin 

two days f or a hearing. At thehearing he was gi ven two m onths to organize his em igration 

f rom  Germany or be sent to a concentrationcam p.
 
W it

comm unity, Erich arrangedf or thefam ily's i m m igration to Chile.

m ove to Israel
 
but ended up m aking their hom e here. 
Sue is with Fred here today. 
A ltho ugh  
they had stopped going to school in Chileata young age in order to work, they resumed their 

educations in the United States, both earninggraduatedegrees, with Fred's in enginee
ring and 

Sue's in m icrobiology. They have lived in theW ashington, D.C. Metropolitan area since 1959.
 
  
 
Af ter working f or the U.S. Navy as a civil ian, including a three
-
year stint in Malta, 
Fred went to workf orNASAfrom  which he retired in1988.W henhe retired, he headed up a 

project using satellite technology to locate crashed planesand sunken ships, which is now 

credited with having saved 40,000 lives. Af terretiring f rom  NASA, Fred worked inprivate 

industry including as an independent consultant.
 
Sue retiredf rom the National Cancer Institute 
in 2000, where she was a research scientist.
 
  
 
Fred and Suehave three children: Ruth,Steven,and Daniel. Ruth worked with her

Fr

F i rs t  P e rs on
 
today.W e have just an hourand you have som uch to share with us so we wi ll get started right 
away. And we will tr y t o cover asm uch as we canduring our tim e.
 
 Y
ou were born in
 
Germ any in 1928,f ive years bef ore Hitler came to power and a 
little over 11 years before the SecondW orldW ar began.Before we turn to life under the Nazis 

and yourfam ily leaving Germany, let's startf irst, tell us a little bitabout yourf am ily and you
 
in  
the years bef ore Hitler cam e topower.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 B
ef ore I answer this, I need to clarif y som ething.T he survi vors who survived 
theexterm ination and concentration cam pshad the worst of  it.T here are survi vors like m yself 

who were taken out oftheir own environm entandtheirfuture was changed because we had to 

leave Germ any and go to af oreign country which culture and language we didn't know. And 

thereare som e survi vors, notthat many, who were hiddenby Germ ans and othersf rom the 

Nazis during
 
the whole tim eof the war. Ibelonged to the m iddle group. Fortunately I didnot 
get called to the camps.W e sim ply had to leave Germ any.W e went toSouth Am erica as 

refugees,and that,of course, changed our life. 
 

 
My parents
 
--
 
what is the question?
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:
 
A littlebit about your fam ily and comm unity beforeHitler cam e topower.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
My parents owned
 
--
 
ordinary citi zens, owned a factory thatm ade rainwear, 
which was unique andim portantenough thatwhen the Nazis, the Arm y andothers, stopped 

buying f rom Jewish businesses,they kept buying f rom m y parents'factory because the 

m anuf acturing was so unique and so important.
 
 
Otherwise, it was sim ply a norm al lif e of German citizens.T hey considered 
them selves good Germ ans, Jewish religion butnevertheless, there were Catholics, Protestants 

andthere were Jews. And they were just like ordinary Germ ans until Hitler cam e and pointed 

out that they were "
n
ot ordinary Germ ans" but they were awf ul andwhatever else.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
In the place
 
where you lived,Konigsberg, how large was the Jewish 
comm unity there? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
T herewere about5,000, never m ore than5,000, Jews in the city. It was a 
relativel y sm all city. The Jewish comm unity never evol ved tom orethan5,000. By the tim e I 

w
as born there were probably only 3,000 left,2,800, something like that. People left.People 
left because Konigsberg, as you had seen onthem ap, thefar eastern corner of  Germany and 

people wanted to goto Berlin.T here was m ore doing in Berlin.Berlin was a more cultured
 

city, offeredm ore opportunities.There were som e Jews in Konigsberg lef t to go to Berlin.But 

others who saw the danger of  the Nazis com ing actually left Germ any.
 
 
I went toa Jewish school which was f ounded in 1935, I believe. And ever
y F r i d a y 
af ternoon we hada social hour, if you will, f or the students. I rem ember practically at every one 

of  thesethere were som e people, some children we said goodbye to because theirf am ilies 

were leaving Germ any
 t
o the UnitedStates
,  
to Palestine, as
 
it was called at that tim e, or other 
countries, you know, wherever they could geta visa.
 
So it was adim inishing comm unity, the 
Jewish com munity was  a dim inishing comm unity becausepeople left.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe turn to theevents af ter Hitler cam e to power, your father was a 
veteran of the Germ an Arm y. Right?
 

>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Yes. He was a veteran of the Germ an Arm y and surprisingl y with all the 
anti
-
Sem itism in 1935,he got the recognitionfor hisf ighting in the FirstW orld W ar. 
S u rp ris in gly.  Yo
u wouldn't have expected a Jew to get that but he did.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You started school in a public school, an all
-
boys public school in 1934, the 

 
4
 
year af ter Hitler cam e to power.T hat was a rough year for you.T ell us about that. 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
W ell,  
it was a rough year in the sensethat I was bullied. I was the only Jewish 
child in school. I was bullied. At one pointI was beaten by one of my co
-
students. T eachers 
didn't intervene. How could they protect a Jewish child in a Christian school? After
 
--
 
d u r i ng 
that year,the Jewish comm unity f oundeda Jewish schoolf or thoseof  us whohad been in 
Germ an schools and could not continuethere.
 
 
T hough Ihave to say thatm y brother, who was older, was in anolder school, 
continued in the German school until he lef tGerm any in 1939. Henever hadany real problem . 

It was in m y class.T hese are6
-
year
-
old children andthey already had been indoctrinated 
enough, probably by their parents, who would tell them that Jews are no good.
 
 
On the otherhand, there were som e childrenin m y class who didn'tparticipate in 
that. So the question was
 
--
 
I couldn'tbef riends with them . I wouldhave loved to bef riends 
with all of these children. But I couldn't. How could they bef riends with a Jewish child? And I 

never obviously f oundout why they were not aggressi ve towards m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e, and as you said, they were indoctr
inated 
already at 6 
years old, including com ing to school with Nazi insi gnia. And eachm orning in class they had to 

s a y " H
e
il Hit le r"
 
and you didnot participate.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
No. Obviously it pointed touteverybody that I was not the sam e "as everybody 
else" .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Infact, you wrote about that tim ethat after afew we eks it was clear to youthat 
you were diff erent, you were an outsider.Soas you said, you moved
 
--
 
you were m oved to a 
Jewish school in Konigsberg. And Konigsberg, you said, was especially anti
-
Sem itic, even 
m ore than m aybe other places.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Yeah.I have to tell you, the Nazi Party had groups in every one
 
--
 
m any parts 
of  Germ any. And theheadof these was called [Speaking Non
-
English Language] inGerman, 
which is essentially a leader of a group.InKonigsberg, it was particularly vi rulent anti
-
Sem ites.
 
 
Not every cit y was the sam e. I came to Ham burg and inthe nine monthsof  stay in 
Ham burg, I never, never, never had an anti
-
Sem itic incident. Konigsberg hadanti
-
Se m it ic  
incidents practically every day. T he children in the school, I don't know how they recogni zed 

m e, maybe looked a little different.
 
T he children would run af ter me. T hey insultedm e.W hat 
was the insult? It was Juden, Jew. Theyf elt that was an insult.Of  course, you know, you can 

look at it indiff erent ways but just to callm e Juden, Jew, they f elt was an insult.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yo u
 
said the Nazi Party was especially virulent. Even as 1933, they had 
already comm ittedarson against synagogues, well before Kristallnacht. You told me thatone 

of  your own earliestmem ories was the May 
D a y P
arade I think of  1934.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Ye s. B u t 
not only the May Day Parade butparadespractically ever y day. 
Young people wouldmarch through the streets and what they were singing about is we are 

going to kill the Jews and then everything would be muchbetterf orGerm any. T hat was asong 

that they sa
ng.T hef irst tim e in 1934. Butall throughm y stay in Konigsberg, beginning 1939, 

these kids, these young people, marched through the streets.
 
 
Now, our apartm ent looked out on the MainStreetof Konigsberg, by wa y of  the 
factory thatm y parents owned. So
 
I saw thatever y day. I couldn't help seeing it every day.  
T hey m arched and sang these terribly aggressive songs. And I guess I was afraid.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e, talking about thef actory
 
--
 
the apartm ent being on the 
Main Street, in1936, Hitler came to Konigsberg and cam e down your street. Tell usabout that.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
W ell,he cam e, drove through the MainStreet
. D
own on the street there were 

 
5
 
actually SS Nazi off icers and since our window of  thefactory looked out over the streets, t
h e y 
askedus to letthem  com e in and see Hitlerfrom  where we were standing. So we had abunch 
of  SS off icers standing at our window.W hether they realized we we re Jewish or not, I don't 

know. And whether they cared or not, Idon't know either. Butaf ter Hitler passed, they left.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
During the tim e, Fred, when youm oved to the Jewish school, that was amuch 
better timef or you in school.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Absolutely. T he teachers were ver y caring. Interestingly enough, I thoughtas 
a 6, 7
-
year
-
ol
d child they were old people
.  In
 
hindsight, theteachers were in their 20s. Even 
theprincipal of the school was in his late 20s. But, you know, as a child, you don't know the 

difference between people in their 20s, 30s, or 50s.
 
 
So anyway, they were ver y,
 
very carin g f or us children.If elt safe. Ifelt secure. Ifelt 
e a s y.  W hat
 
was not easy was the walk f rom m y home to the synagogue where the school was 
located, thebig synagogue. And you saw a picture beforethe burned
-
out synagogue af ter 
Kristallnacht. 
T here were kids along the streets who tried tobully m e. But, you know, they were 
young Nazi kids indoctrinated.
 
But the schoolitself was fabulous. I had absolutely no 
com plaints.I enjoyed going to school.It was such a safe placef orus.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Fred, I think
 
--
 
I believe it was 1937 your parents had anopportunity, Ibelieve, 
to em igrate to Chile but they didn't.W hydid they not leave when they had the chance?
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
W ell, I'm  not sure. Ihave tof irst say thatm y father, like m any oth
e r G e rman  
Jews, considered themselves Germ ans, period. And they did not see the great danger. Im ean, 

it was bef ore the Holocaust,obviously, 1937,1938, but there were a lot of anti
-
S e m it ic  
incidents, particularly in Konigsberg. Butm y father was secure a
s a Germ an citizen. He had 

fought in the First World W ar. He was a Jewish Germ an, Germ an wit h the Jewish f aith. So 

there was no particular reasonf or them  to leave.
 
 
Now, how the opportunity to go to Chile came along in 1937 I am  not sure, but I 
r e m em be r  i
n our living room m y m other
 
exclaim ing it is an earthquake country, 
ﬁ
I wil l never go 
to an earthquake country.
ﬂ 
Of  course, we ended up afterwards but she didn't want to go. So I 
guess sheprevailed and we didn't go to Chile atthat time.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As
 
awful as things were for yourf am ily and other Jews in Konigsberg, after 
Hitler cam e topower in 1933, things becamefar worse with andaf ter Kristallnacht, or Nightof  

BrokenGlass, in Novem ber
 
1938, when Jews throughout Germany andAustriahad their 
bus
inesses vandalized, their hom es ransacked, and synagogues burned.W hathappened to 
your f am ily as a resultof Kristallnacht?
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Ok, let m ef irst say about Kristallnacht, crystal night.A young Jew, a Polish 
Jew, whose parents had been deported
 
f rom Germ any back to Poland, 
shot an 
embassy 
em ployee in Paris. And when thatm an died,ever ybody knew som ething would happen tous. 

I'm  sure the Nazis had preparedf rom  Rom e and a couple of days afterwards, they invadedall 

the apartm ents, the stores they broke into the stores. T hey set f ire to the big synagogue and 

eventually thef ire wasputoutbut there were several other synagogues inthe city that were 

not set f ire because they were close
 
--
 
integrated into neighborhoods and had they been set 
af i r e ,
 
the neighborhood m ight have been setaf ire so they were just, quote,destroyed
 
--
 
excuse 
m e. They were destroyed butnot setaf ire. Our synagogue was set af ire.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Because it stoodalone.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
It stood alone, separate from other houses.And they could saf ely set itaf ire.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf ather was arrested thatnight along with otherfam ily m em bers.Tell us 
about that.
 

 
6
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
He wa s ver y lucky in a sense. Jewish m en all through Germ any were arrested 
and sent to concentration cam ps where many suff eredf rom  the cold, f rom the treatment. 
Konigsberg, being on thefar eastern corner,was toof arf rom a concentration cam p. I guess 

the city had tof inance the transport of Jews f rom Konigsberg totheconcentration cam ps so 

th e
y opted to put the Jews in jail.
 
My f ather was arrested along with all theother menand he 
was put in jail. Jail was a benign environmentcom pared to concentration cam ps.T hey stayed 

in jail. Infact, the wives couldbring blankets to them  in jail.T hey we re relatively, speaking 

relativel y, comf ortable.
 
They were releasedafter som e weeks. My father was sucha good 
Germ an that he
 
said that is the worst that could ever happen to us, so we are safe now. And, 
again, he would not have ever have lef tbutf or so
m ething
 
--
 
you want me to talk about it?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Not quite yet. I was going to ask you, arrested along with your father was a 
14
-
year
-
old cousin,
 
r i gh t ?
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Oh, yeah. ButI had a cousin
 
--
 
m y m other's sister, her husband, the cousin 
liv
ed in a small villa ge m aybe 50
 
kilom eters distancef rom Konigsberg. T hey even arrestedthe 
14
-
year
-
old boy because, after all, he was also guilty of  the shooting in Paris,of  the German 
Em bassy em ployee. Even the 14
-
year
-
old boy was in great danger.
 
 
M y p a
rents had arranged to send meona children's transportto England. England 
hadopened its doors to children to save them . I was on the list to go toEngland on that 

program . Oneday If ound out I was no longer on the list.W hy? Becausem y cousin in a litt
le  
vil lage was in such danger that m y place on that program  had been gi ven to m y cousin. He 

went to England instead of m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Fred,Iknow you want to talkabout this. I was very t aken whenI read in your 
bookaf ter Kristallnacht, with your s ynagogue burned, that you, asa10
-
year
-
old boy, several 
tim es went to the ruins by yourself . It was ver y poignant what you wrote.Tell us about that.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
T he school was movedf rom the synagogue to theJewish
 
orphanage whi ch 
was ri ght next door.
 
There was af ence between the Jewish orphanage andthe synagogue. I 
found a hole in thefence and I wentthroughthefence several tim es to the synagogue.I never 

saw anybody else, nochild, no adult.And why I went, I cannot recall. It was maybe to say 

g
oodbye tothe synagogue that had been such ahom e to us. Iprobably went f our orf ive tim es. 
But I f ound at one point
 Œ  
 
I have to explain to you what aT orah is.ATorah is a handwritten scroll of the f ive 
booksof  Moses. Andever y s ynagogue had at least
 
one and som etim esm oratoria scrolls.And 
during Kristallnacht they were all takenout and strewn all over the synagogues. Andthe 

synagogue was, again, not only burned but inside the place where we prayed was all 

destroyed, benches overturned.
 
 
But anywa y, I went in there.And one day wh en I was in there, Ifound a small 
children'sT orah. I took it and kept itana mem entoever since. It'san importantm em ory of m y 

go i n g 
t
o the synagogue. Again,I never found anybody else.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Youf ound it in the rubble.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
If ound it in the rubble. I" rescued"  it.And I'm glad I did. Again, it's important to 
m e. I've kept it ever since.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Fred,af ter Kristallnacht and after you weren't able togo on the Kindertransport 
to England because your cousin went insteadof  you, your parents sent you and Manf redto 

Ham burg. T ellus why you went to Ham burgand what it was like for you there. You said earlier 

that you did not experience any anti
-
Sem iticevents while you were there.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow
:  
Yeah,I saidearlier that differentparts of Germ any had different head of the 

 
7
 
party in that region. Ham burg had one who was not thatactive anti
-
S e m it ic
al
ly. I spent about 
ninem onths in Ham burg. I never, ever, ever hadananti
-
Sem itic incident.W e went
 
t o s c h oo l .  
T here was a Jewish schoolandeverybody knew where the Jewish school was. Inever 
experienced an anti
-
Sem itic incident. It wasextrem ely quiet compared tom y hom etown of 
Konigsberg.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Synagogues in Ham burg had also been burned during Kristallnacht.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Of course, synagogues had beenburned.Infact,next to the Jewish school 
there was aburned
-
out synagogue. But I never went in there. It was lockedupand closedand 
I never went in there. But ithad beenburnt out.
 
>> B
ill Benson:
 
You were staying with f am ily f riends?
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 Y
eah, acquaintances of  m y parents.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They took you infor thatnine
-
m onth period.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hileyou and your brother were in Ham burg for those nine
 
months, do you 
know what lif e was like for your parents? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
My parents hada tough time in Germany. First of all, thef actory was 
Aryanized, m eaning the Jewish businesses, in general, were sold to non
-
Jews. And they were 
sold, practically gi ven away. T he Nazis forced them to, quote, give away the factory. Butfor 

som e reasonm y father stayed involved. In what capacity I don't know. But my father stayed 

invol ved until m id
-
1 93 9.
 
 
Andm aybenow is thetim e to talk about this.He had an em ployee who cam e to 
work there in a Nazi uniform. He was a Nazi. And,of  course, a Jew doesn't firea Nazi. Sohe 

stayed on. Itturnsouthe hadembezzled a lot of m oney and he wanted my father out of the 

wa y. So af ter Kristallnacht, the Jews were forbidden to havef irearms. And one day this 

em ployee opened the safe, in the presence of  witnesses, and loand behold there was a gun in 

there.Sothe man was called Meyer. So Mr.
 
Meyer said he would call theGestapo and tell 
them  about this. And he did. Andm y f ather was called tothe Gestapo two days later.
 
 
Interestingly enough, here was a Gestapo off icer who said
,  
Idon't believe Mr.
 
Me ye r,  
I'm  sure you were f ramed in some way and you didn't put that gun inthat saf e; s
o instead of 
sending you to a concentration cam p,
 
we wil l  gi ve you som e time to leave Germany. If  you 
can't leave by then, then we have to send you toa concentration cam p. 
 
 
My f atherpresented the problem tothe Jewis h com munity. Andm y parents had 
obviously been great supporters of the Jewish com munity. And theJewish com munity 

arrangedf orus to leave. And where were they sending us? Quote/unquoteto Chile. So 

m other,notwithstanding she didn't want to go to theearthquake country, we endedup in Chile. 

And it was because the Jewish comm unity was able
 
to arrange visas and passages on the 
ship and so on. So we ended up in Chile.
 
W eleft after the war had already started.T he war  
started in September
 
39, but Italy was not in the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforeyou go there.Let me go back a little bit, Fred,
 
if I can.T ell us when it 
f inally looked like youwere now going to beable to leave, whatdidyour parentsdoto 

prepare? How did they preparef or you to leave? I know one of them  is they had youandyour 

brother start taking Spanish lessons.
 
>>
 
Fre d  Fla
t o w:
 
Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hatdid they do? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
W ell, they packed huge containers, inGerman called lif ts.And they packed 
two huge containers which were to be sent to Chile eventually. And the lif ts were sent to 

 
8
 
Holland to be storeduntil we
 
lef t, and to be sentaf ter us to Chile.W e never saw them  again. 
Andeverything we eve r owned was in those two boxes, those two lifts.W e never saw them 
again.W ell, our lives got saved.Thatmay bem ore im portant thanhaving lost what was in 

those containers in those boxes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
One of thethings you wrote about, Fred, is that as you were preparing to go to 
Chile, the war broke out. So September
 
1, 1939, atthat point you thoughtall hopeof  going 
was gone.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Infact, you wrote " I preparedfor war." W hat did thatm ean? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
W ell,first of all, let me talk about1st September
 
39
w
hen Hitler declared war. I 
rem em ber com ing downf rom  our apartmentto a gas station acrossthe street where therewas 

a radio. And his speech was carried onthe radio. Lotsof  people were listening. Of course, I 

stood there, too, listening. I didn't go to school thatday. Asfar as I was concerned, we would 

never leave Germany now.
 
W hat m y parentsdid, I don't know. My b rother andI were in 
Ham burg. Oneday we  got a letter or something to meet m y parentsin Berlin. I think it was 

Octo be r
 
39, becausewe were going to Chile. That'saboutasm uch as I know. And we took a 
train toItaly and then a ship to Chile.
 
 
But there'san interesting thing. You were not allowed to takeoutany m oney. I think 
for each of us10m arks, which was about
 
$2.50 ea
ch  
or som ething like that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
S o  lik e
 
$10 total.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
$10 total. Butm y f ather had takenm oney and hid iton the train. He wentto 
the toileton thetrain and hid it inthe toilet, inthebathroom ,bef orewe went to theborder.So 

them oney was safely hidden. Andaf ter the train passedthe border into Italy, he went to the 

bathroom  and retrieved the money. Not riches
 
but we hadat least som e money to start lif e, at 
least to spend during the six weeks or so it took us to gof rom  Genoa by ship to Santiago
,  to
 
Ch ile .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Italy was an ally of Germany.W asthere any danger of  going through Italy as 
your avenuef or leaving?
 

>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
No. Italy was not yet in the war. But I rem em ber onthe ship,every ni ght there 
was a huge Italianf lagon top so that 
if  t h e  B r i t
s came andtried to bom bard enem y vessels, 
they knew thatthis particular ship was not anenem y vessel; it was a neutral country.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
At that tim e.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Italy was neutralfor a long tim e. " Fora long tim e," for several m onths af ter 
that. And, again, we went out while Italy was still neutral.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You wr ote in your book, "W ewere the last to leave. All those lef tbehind were 
m urdered."  Did anyone you know survi ve? 
 

>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
If I th in k
 
--
 
none of the people who were still therewhen we lef t survi ved. W e 
never saw them again. From  my child's vie wpoint, these were m y f riends, m y schoolf riends, 

who were m urdered. Of  course, their parentswere m urdered, too.
 
Initially we didn't know 
where they hadbeen taken, whether taken on a train and shot when they arri ved or whatever. 

Lateron If ound out where they had gone. And, indeed, they were shot right when the train 

arrived. T hey were all shot whenthe trainarrived.
 
 
From  what I know, wh at Iunderstand, is thatthere were trucks waiting when the 
train arrived and all the depor
te
es were loaded on the train and taken toa certain place, 
m aybe 20
 
kilom eters awa y, and upon arrival they were all shot.T hegra ves hadalready been 
prepared and they wer e all shot. Amongst them  som e of m y bestf riends.

>> Bill Benson:
 
Fred,as a young boy, you've lef t Germ any
; y
ou're now on a shipon your way 
to Chile. Do you remem ber what youfelt that you felt as you lef tthere? And at what pointdid 
you have a senseof  Iam  truly safe?W hen did that happenfor you? 
 

>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
W ell,while I was in Konigsberg, I was alwa ys af raid. Ihad nightmares every 
night, always the same nightm are.T here were som edunes andthey would fall and asphyxiate 

m e.W hen we lef t Germ any and we came toItaly and stood on theship that would takeus to 

Chile, atthat point I was saf e. I knew I was safe. Ino longer
 
had any nightm ares. My dreams 
were just like any normal child's dream s.T hat m om ent in Italy, on that ship, Ifelt safe.I guess 

thatanswers the question you have.W hendid Ifeel thatI was " Safe" .Indeed, it was.
 
 
W hen we came to Chile, it was ver y, ver y, ver y diff icult.Think of this. My parents at 
thatpoint who arealready in their 50s,didn'tspeakthe language,didn't know Spanish, didn't 

know how to earntheir living, and they came to a country they didn'tknow what theirf uture 

would be.
 
A s it tu
rnedout, somebody f rom the Jewish comm unity in Santiago awaitedus and 
others.So when we got off the ship, they took us, accompaniedus in Santiago, to aplace 

where you li ve and get your f ood.T his wholeplace was
 
--
 
all thepeople in that place were 
im
m igrants just like us.
 
 
Now what do you dofor a living? T he Jewishcomm unity in Konigsberg, in Chile
, 
in  
Santiago, hadm ade som e provisions that inthatthey I guess gavem y parents som em oney 

and supported usduring the early tim e in Chile. My parentsalmost im mediately wanted tostart 

workin g. T hey openeda f actory, so
-
called,for wom en's wear. T hefactory were two sewing 
m achines. Right no
w, we had one room form e, m y brother and my parents. Andalmost 

im mediately af ter two or three days, orfour days, a big table was installedandtwo sewing 

m achinesappeared, am achine to cut the cloth, and they startedm aking women's wear. So 

thefactory in our living room, our bedroom , were all the sam e room .
 
 
You know, as a child, I accepted it. Youdon'treally ask
 
m any questions. But I 
im agine whatm ust it have beenf orm y parents who had been in Germ any. Not wealthy, but 

we were good uppermiddle class.And now suddenly they were in this one room, allf ourof us 

and the so
-
calledf actory all in one room.W hatm ust
 
it have beenf or them ? 
 
 
I mean, their lives wer e saved, clearly, but the Holocaust hadn't happened yet.T hey 
didn't know what woul d have happened to them had they stayed inGerm any. It musthave 

been terriblefor them. I mean, in hindsight,as a child, I
 
was 10, 11years old, I didn't realize it. 
But now as I grew older and we're thinking abouthow they m ust have
 
--
 
what it m ust have 
beenf or them .Itm ust have been terrible. Again, they were in their50s. T hey were not young 

people anym ore.W hen I was born, m y mother was 42. So by this tim e she was 52 or 53.My 

father was three yearsolder. It musthave been a terrible timefor them .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Fred, you shared with me that you have som e letters that were wr itten to your 
parents f rom  som e of  the folk
s you knew,f amily m em bers in Germ any. Say a little about those 
le tte rs.
 

>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
T he letters cam ebothfrom  thefam ily who had taken us in Hamburg, me and 
m y brother,andf riends in Konigsberg. T hey becam eever m oreterrible. Basically what they 

wr
ote is we are poor,we have no money, we  don't even have enough m oney for postage 
anym ore.And certainly there'snom oney, hardly any m oney, toeat.T hey becam e really, really 

u l t ra
 
poor.T hisfam ily i n Hamburg wrote, "W e can't write anym orebecause we don't have 
m oney for the postage" 
A
nd anotherfam ily f rom  Konigsberg wrote the sam e thing to m y 
parents.
 
 
T here was a little girl Ihadplayed with all thetim e.Again, rem em ber, I was 10,11 

 
10
 
years old. She wrote a letter to me in Chile. Inever answered.T othis day If eel guilty. She was 
m urdered likeeverybody else. But simply, again, as a child, you disregard these things. I never 

answered this letter. I mean,her parents, her m other wrote to m y mother to my parents
 a
nd  
then she includeda letter form e, t
wi c e ,  wh i c h  
I never answered. Now,
 
you know, this is now
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Likemany boys, how m any boys would behave.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Sure.T his is, what, 70 years ago, I stillf eel guilty.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Fred,as you said earlier, you lef t Germ any six weeks  af terthe war began. Do 
you know of anybody else who lef t Germ any later than youdidand got out? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
No. I think Idid.T here wasf riendsof m y brother, young wom en whom aybe at 
the tim e were 15 had gone to Berlin. Already
 
--
 
m aybe along Kristallnachtor so they went to 
Berlin. And Ithinkthey lef t Germ any af ter we did. But these were the only people that I know 

positively that they lef t and were able to leave. Infact, we lived in New York andm y wif eand I 

visited them once.W egot theaddress andfoundout where they were and we visited them. 

But to the bestof m y knowledge, they got out af ter we did.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Speaking of  your wif e, do you m ind sharing with us how you m et Sue? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Yes. Chile was ver y interesting.W e came to Chileand we alm ost 
im mediately
 
--
 
we, m y brotherand I
 
--
 
joineda group of Germ an
-
Jewish children. The group 
vaguel y had som e ideas that perhaps we wo uld go to Palestineeventually. Remember, Israel 

didn'texist yet. Andmy wif e equally joined 
that group. I m et her about f our or f ive weeks after 

we cam e to Chileand that group had a party,or whatever you want to call it, a children's party, 

andI mether.W e were 11 years old.
 
 
W hat is important in Chile was thatthis group that would take care
 
of  children 
eventually becam edogm atically Zionist. First of  all, it's a very, ver y lef t
 
--
 
p o lit ic a lly ve r y le f t,  
and secondly is that we were expectednot only to go to Palestine but go to Kibbutz. Som e of  

you m ay know what Kibbutz is. It'sa collective
 
f arm  that belonged to this particular movement. 
 
 
W ebecam e very in vol ved in that movem ent.Until
 
--
 
wel l, we started going together 
when we were, what, 17.W e both became a little sick of the
 
dogm atism  of thisparticular 
m ovement this left
i
st, 
ul t r a
-
le f t is t
, 
u l t ra
-
zio n is t
 
m ovement.W e lef t the m ovement. And we cam e 
to Am erica,onthe way to Palestine
 
--
 m
aybe by that tim e it was Israel already
 
--
 t
hinking that 
m aybe we would learnsom ething here.W e were still going to go toPalestine but live in the 

c it y
.W e wouldn't go to the Kibbutz that was part of thism ovem ent, Zionist movement.Andwe 
cam e toAmerica thinking we would stay, what, six m onths or something like that.W ell, that 

was 70
-
odd years ago.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I guess you're staying. 
 
>>
 
Fred Flat
o w:
 
And we are still here. [Laughter]
 
 
Actually, we knew when we cam e toAmericathat we would have toearn our living. 
W egotan imm igration visa. So we were legal
,  
so to speak, to earn our livin g.
 
 
A t tha t tim e
 
--
 
again, Ihave to goback to that. German
 
citizens, in Germ any, were 
not given visas to America. W hy? Because they were presum ed tohave been Nazis and they 

were blockedf rom  com ing to America. So when we appliedfor ourvisa in Chile, you apply as 

a Germ an.W e were Germ ans and not C
h i l ean .  W e ha
dabsolutely no problem getting a visa. 
Alm ost imm ediately got a visaf or Am erica.
 
 
Af ter af ew weeks af ter we appliedand got our visa, suddenly the State Departm ent 
decided thatall Germans were able to get American visas and the quota was totally, total
l y 
f illed. Af riendof  ours in Chile, who also wanted to do what we did, she applied when the 

Germ ans already were  adm itted to Am erica,and shehad to wait yearsf or immigration visa to 

 
11
 
get an im m igration visa. For us it was we wai teda coupleof  weeks,m onths maybe. So it was 
easy for us to com e.
 
 
W ecame here and we thought we would stay for six m onths or whatever it was. But 
I have to tell you som ething.W e were born in Germany, Nazi Germany.W e lived in Chile. 

Chile was a dem ocracy but not entirely. And
 
we were alwa ys, like in some Spanish
-
speaking 
countries, we rem ained gringos.W e were outsiders, always, f or thewhole time.And thenwe 

cam e toAmerica andwe were acceptedhere like everybody else.Nobody calledus a gri ngo. 

Am erica was open, open to foreigners, to imm igrants. Am erica was an im m igrant country. And 

we f elt comfortable.Wefelt we were really, truly, if  I canuse that word, seduced into staying 

here because America was such an open, wonderf ul, open country. And this is how we stayed. 

T he r e
 
was no reason to leave.We felt at home practically thef irst day we cam e here.W ell,not 
thef irstday, obviously, but, you know, af ter afew weeks, af ter two or threemonths we felt at 

home.There was no reason to go anywhere else.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W ell,
 
we're glad you stayed. Ican tell you that.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I thinkwe have tim efor just a few questionsf rom  our audience if  you're will ing 
to take a couple.
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Absolutely.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e have m icrophones on b
oth aisles. W eask that if you have a question, 
please wait until you have a m icrophone,make your questionas brief  as you can. I'll repeat it 

just tobe sure we all hear it correctly and then Fred will respond.
 
And I ask if  you will stay with 
us through the questions because we are not f inished with Fred quite yet. He is going tohave 

som ef inal words to close.
 
 
Do we have 
anybody that has a question? T
here we go, right back there 
 
>>
 
Of  thef riends that you lived in Germ any wi th, did you, after the war, meetup with any of 
them ? Didany survi ve to your knowledge?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To your knowledge
,  
did any of  yourf riends survi ve and if  so, did you havea 
chance to meet with them ?
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Noneof m y closef riends survi ved. Again, these two wom en who were m y 
brother'sf riends, som ewhat older, we m et them  here,again in New York. But of m y really 

close f riends, not one of  them
 
--
 
well, I have to correct that.T here were som e Jews in
 
Konigsberg who survi ved who were half
-
Jews. Full Jews, m eaning having
 
both Jewish 
parents, none of them survived. Some of these "
h
alf  Jews," having one Jewish and one 
non
-
Jewish parent,did survive and we m et them . But I knew themf rom before the war butthey 
were not closef riends. Of m y really close f riends,notone of them  survi ved.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you.
 
 
A couple of questionsdown here. Here com es them ic.
 
>>
 
T hank youf orbeing here. Can you speak toforgi veness? 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Can you speak tof orgiveness?T he question, how do youf eel
 
--
 
>>
 
Yeah. How
 
--
 
was there anger? Did you com e toterm s with your  story?
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
Yeah.T hat's a very interesting question. As it turned out, I workedf orthe 
Am erican governm ent. And since I spoke Germ an, Iof tentim es went tom eetings between the 

Am ericans and Germans. And they were always older people, m y age and youngerpeople. 

T he  
people m y age, I asked myself ,W hat would you have done tom ehad you metm e, you 
know, bef ore the war? 
 

 
T he younger people
 
--
 
I also was the only one in the delegation whospokeGerman. 

 
12
 
And 
the younger people always knew wh y I spokeGerman, who I was and so on.T he older 
people also knew but I had no contact with these older people and Ididn't wantany contact 
with them .I avoided them . The younger people who were ver y s ym pathetic Imadef ri
ends with 
som e of them . Af ter all, they had nothing to do with what the Nazis did to us.
 
 
So the answer is yes and no. Peoplem y age andolder I avoided. Inever in these 
m e et i n gs
 
--
 
these were always group m eetings. I never hadany contact with any of  the
 
older 
people except, again,with the younger oneswho I m ade goodf riends.
 
 
I have to tell som ething which is a little aside.W hen theGermans cam e here
 
--
 
we  
had some social life.We invitedthem for dinner and likewise when we went over there,they 

i n vi
ted us. At one point they came here andIaskedone of ourf riends, one of the young 
people, if they had nothing to do, come go tothe swim m ing pool,have dinner. Andthen I said 

if one of  your colleagues doesn'thave anything to do, bring them along. And he brought along 

oneof  these older people. And that person cam e 
to  
usf inding him self athom e, Germ ans, 
im mediately talked about the wonderful things Hitler haddone. Now, I was the head of the 

project. I couldn't kick them out.T hat would have been adiplom atic incident. But you can see 

theanswers to your question why I didn'thave any contact with theolder people, exceptf or 

this one tim eand it so happened I couldn'tavoid it.
 
 
My younger f riends eventually took thisolderpersonaside and toldhim  where he 
was and that stoppedhis adm irableexclam ations about what the Nazis and what Hitler had 

done.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
One more questionf rom  this gentlemanand then we will close our program .
 
>>
 
You had said you were 
b
ullied in school.And your brother, that didn't happen. But outside 
of  the things that happened with thefactory and thearrest, did your parents experience abuse 

while you guys were in Konigsberg?
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Outside what you describedof  bullying, did your parents
 
--
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
No ,
 
I don't think they had any physical abuse, if  youwi ll. T heolderpeople 
were not like the children who didn't really know, basically, what they were doing. Of  course, 

you know, theirf actory was takenaway and this issue with the gun in the safe.T hat wa
s 

obviously an attempt to destroy them  because thism an who had em bezzled all of  this money 

wanted m yf ather outofthe way.W ell,he gotm y f atherout of the way but not the way he 

thought he would.
 
 
My parents were suchgood Germ ans.T hey would have neve
r, n e ve r lef t.It wa s 
only after this incident,this man who tried todestroy us by calling the Gestapobecauseof the 

gun hehad placed in the safe.It savedour lives because at this point the Gestapo toldm y 

father you have to leave because otherwise you're going toa concentration cam p. 
 
 
So the ideaof  destroying, getting rid of m y father andm y fam ily, resulted in the 
exact opposite. Because it saved
 
--
 
it really, really, really sa ved our lives becausem y parents 
would never have lef totherwise. Soour lives were saved by this m an who had
 e
m bezzled, this 
Nazi who em bezzled
,  
all of  this money by the factory.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou, Fred.T hank you all for your questions.Hold onf or a moment.I'm 
going to wrap up and then Fred will wrap us up with some closing comm ents.
 
 
W e'll have program s eachW ednesday andThursday until them iddle of August. So 
we hope youm ight com e back and joinus. But if  not,the museum 's website wil l have 
information about
 
F i rs t  Pers o n
 
for 2018.
 
 
W hen Fred is done, it's our t
radition at
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
that our 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
gets the 
last word. So when Fred is done, he is going to leave the stage andgo back out,uphere, 

 
13
 
where he's going to be available to sign
 
copies of  hisbook, "Loss and Restoration."  So if  you 
talk to him  the
n, you'llhave a chance to askhim  a question.
 
 
Andalso when Fred isdone, our photographer, Joel, is going to come up on stage 
andtake aphotograph of  Fred with you as the background.So wewant you to stay put 
because that will be a really nice picture
 
for Fred to have af ter he's donetoday.
 
 
So on thatnote, Fred? 
 
>>
 
Fred Flatow:
 
A couple of things I would like to say. First, thefactthatI had to leave
 
--
 
we  
hadto leave our homein Germany and imm igrate to Chile andeventually to America, Ithink i
t 
was a terrible thing but I think it broadened me. Itbroadenedall of us intellectually because we 

cam e with this Germ an cultureand thenacquired,f orus, Chilean culture but for others their 

culture.Andf or us com ing toAmerica, we acquired American culture. I think as individuals it 

broadened us.
 
 
And theother thing is in spite of  whatthe Germ ans didtous, IthinkI
 
--
 
of  c ou r s e ,  
m y wif e ,  t o o
 
--
 
we hada good lif e. Chile wasgood to us.America was goodtous when we 
cam e here. It accepted us asfull individuals not as gringos or whatever else. I'm  very happy 

that we were ableto com e to America and live our lives here.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you, Fred.
