ARNOLD EINHORN 
March 1, 1995 
 
01:01:00 
 

A:  My name  is Arnold Einhorn. I was born in Antwerp, Belgium, on May 1, 1923. 
My parents were not native of Antwerp; my 
father was of Polish nationality, my mot her, 

too. One was Russian-Polish and the other one 
wa s what they call a "Galicianer," from 
Galicia, from Austria. But both of them ca me
 to--respectively one, my
 fa ther,to Holland, 
when he was a young teenager and my mother as a young child, to Antwerp, before 

WWI. During WWI, my mother was in Engla
nd and my father was in Holland and then 
they ma rried in Holland and--where they had 
their first child. And we were a family of 
five children. My father at first had a delic
atessen in Antwerp, a 
kosher delicatessen, and 
he also had a hotel on the seas
ide, but the delicatessen failed, sort of, after a certain time, 
with the depression; and then he continued 
his seaside hotel. He was a very Orthodox 
ma n, but not a bearded--he was a westernized
 Orthodox Jew, very traditionally Jewish. 
Antwerp had a--the entire population of Belgium,
 as far as Jews are concerned, is about 
50 to 60--50,000. Then when the refugees came, 
after '33 to '39, I think, they went up to 
60,000. The ma jority of the Jews lived in Antwerp.  
 

01:03:30 

  
They were a very separate community from the 
rest, I think. They had be
en lured by King Albert 
I, from Holland mostly, in order to start th
e diamond business. However, it became  ve ry 
difficult, even if you were born in Belgium, to become  Belgian. There was a certain 
discrimi nation, as far as natu
ralization is concerned, agains
t the Jews. And even when 
you were born there, you had to opt for the Be
lgian nationality actively. It was expensive, 
and it was very fastidious; it took time. I know th
at just before the war, when I was 16, I 
started opting and by the time the WWII starte
d, I still hadn't gotten my nationality. And 
then Poland gave up the Jews and we all 
became stateless, even
 though I was born in 
Belgium and considered us Belgian. I was bi
lingual and I went to high school there. I 
went to grade school there--I mean
 grade school, not high school.  
 

01:04:30 

 

 In general, the government was not antisem
itic. Antwerp in particular had a Socialist 
ma yor, Ca mille Huysma ns, who was quite supportive of the Je ws, but by '36, a very 

strong Fascist move me nt--two actually--one 
was the Flemish Fascist moveme nt by Staf 

de Clercq,
1
 who was virulent anti-Semitic; and the Rexist
2
 movement of Degrelle,

 Like the VNV, the Rexist move me nt was

officially, it called itself an
 authoritarian governme nt. Rexism reached its peak between

subsequently furnished soldiers to Hitler. De
grelle and Staf de Clercq were virulently 
anti--they went into--I had been once--no-
-more than once, beaten up on the streets 
because they would occasionally raid. Groups 
of uniformed Fascists would come  in the 
Jewish quarter and just beat up 
the Jewish boys and older people. 
 
Q:  What year was this? 

 

A:  It was in '38 to '39. I remember being--just comi ng in, and then suddenly they 
would, they would attack bearded Jews in the 
streets, and then if they saw some body that 
they thought lived in that area, they woul
d just beat them up, too. And that happened. 
That's  about all, but there were a number
 of Zionist move ments and even Revisionist
4
 
move me nts, so that the Jews had quite 
a free life there. The governme nt had no 
discrimi nation, officially. Of course, if you want
ed to have certain jobs, then there were 
discri mi nations, so, in ge neral, I would say Belgium had a certai n enlightened attitude  

towards the Jews. We  were not affected, othe
r than by having those 10,000 refugees from 

Germany, by what was going on in Germany 
until May the 10th. When we woke up and 
Antwerp was bombed by the Germans and we 
discovered we were 
at war, we were 
invaded. It was very fast and the 13th or 14t
h of May they had already reached almost the 
sea, the North Sea. Belgium is very small 
and as you know, the king capitulated within a 
week, I think. Because we had a small hotel righ
t at the sea shore, my
 father took a taxi 
and just left everything in 
our apartment in Antwerp and reached that place, but we 
stayed only there for one day, because we h
eard that the Germans had already occupied, 
were already reaching the sea, and so we followed the flow of those thousands of 

refugees that clogged the roads and occasiona
lly were attacked by the planes, you know, 
just came  down, swooping down and machine-gunned the refugees. And I had a small--

my brother is 15 years younger, so I had 
him. He  had whooping cough and I was just 
carrying him on my ba ck and he was just ha
ving his spells on my back and vomiting on 
us. It was a terribl e pl ace because we used to
 be on the roads and then hide, jumping off 
the roads and just going by foot. 
 

01:08:30 

 

   The French at first hadn't opened the, hadn't opened the border, so we 
were camping there for I think two days w
ithout having food or anything and then 
suddenly they opened the border and we could 
come  down to France. Somehow I thought 
that--because everybody was going towards Arra
s and the northern ci
ties near the border 
because they hoped that they would get to 
England. We --my father--
found some  kind of a 
private car and they brought us down to Pari
s. And we found later on that most of those 
refugees who tried to go to Arras were bombe
d at the station and killed. He ma naged to 
get to Paris, and we stayed there for one night
 when my father again heard that we had to 
regist er as refugees, especially
 if we weren't Belgian, and so he went to the police. There 
he--that's when he had--at first he was a very
 great admi rer of the French, he thought they 
were--the French revolution was real ly the re
presentatives of what a republic should

mean--and a freedom-loving republic. And that's 
when he had--the first time , he asked, 
and he said that we would like to stay in 
Paris if we could, and the ma n said, ﬁYou dirty 
Jew,ﬂ and hit him and said, ﬁYou better report tomorrow to the--ﬂ what they call the 

caserne de tourelles,
5
 which is a military barracks, where then we found that all the 
refugees were being channeled towards various
 parts of France. The second time that we 
realized how antisemitic actually po
lice was, was in the trai n.  
 

01:11:00 

 

 There were ma ny refuge es from all over, most
 Jews. And Italy was then a Fascist country 
and was just going into, was then entering the 
war. There was an Italian worker who was 
totally uneducated. The police was assi
gning to each wagon, you know, a person in 
charge, and I say my fat her was the most e
ducated person in that place and he was a 

really respectable-looking 
ma n, but they took the Italian worker who was drunk and 
uneducated and put him in charge because, he
 said it openly, ﬁI'm not going to put any 
Jew in charge of a wagon.ﬂ So that was the thing. 
 

Q: How long were you in Pa ris? 

 

A:  Only 48 hours I think--72 hours. Becaus
e we--they-- didn't want to have Jewish 
refugees in Paris, and so they evacuated a
nd we went with other Belgian non-Jews into--
we ended up after a long ordeal on the train a
nd buses in central France, in the Ardèche. 
It's a small state, a small department, wh
ich the capital had ab
out 4,000 inhabitants and 
we ended up in a haml et where we stayed fo
r three months over the summer. It was a 
far m, I became  a far m boy. As a ma tter of fact
, I keep in touch with the farmer I me t. I 
have been several times to this haml
et 50 years later. He's still alive. 
 

Q:  How did you connect with the farmer? 

 

A:  Oh, they put us up in a factory. They 
put us up in a factor
y that was--that only 
worked during the winter because  they didn't ha
ve electricity and in the winter there was 
enough water to get the--to farm the--it was a silk, they were doing, some thing was just 

silk thread or some thing--and we were barrack
ed there, at a village
 there. And within a 
few--when in June we came there in May, th
e end of May. On June
 18th, I think, France 
capitulated and Pétain
6
 took over. The Belgian refugees who were non-Jewish were 
repatriated. There was also another Jewish 
fa mily who also was--chose to go back to 
Belgium. The reason why is because  rumor spreads very quickly that there were camps 

all over France, especially near the Pyrén
ées, Saint-Cyprien, Anjouleme, Corse, where 
the conditions were extremely diffic ult, and th
ey said they were very harsh towards the 
Jews in particular, and so we heard about it.
 And as a ma tter of fact, we heard that the 
oldest sisterof my mother, 
her husband, her daughter, and her 
grandchild were there, and 
there were conditions so bad that they al
so chose to go back to Antwerp. And when

another Jewish fa mily in that little vill
age called Sa int-Julien du Corse, population 
including I think the animals, was 600 people; 
but it was spread over miles and miles. It's 
a haml et. We chose to stay there, until the wi
nter came, in which we then moved to the 
capital, which is Brive. And there we--suddenl
y on Nove mber, I think in Nove mber, were 
told that we had to report to a camp in A
gde, the next morning, just to take the bare 
essentials, leave everyt hing el
se and leave and go to Agde. 
 
01:15:00 

 

 And that's in Nove mber '40. We  then repor
ted to a concentration camp. That was a real 
concentration camp. 
 

Q:  Okay, before--I want  you to tell me  about Agde, but when you were in this town, 
where you were working as a farm boy?  Wa
s there any poor treatment of you or your 
fa mily because you were Jewish? 
 

A:  No, no, nothing. They didn't even know a
nything. I mean, they were very simple 
people and also, the inhabitants of the Ardèche in
 particular, it's the 
only province. It used 
to be a province of France, where the Huguenots 
used to hide. There ar
e still caves in the 
mountains. They had a long history of religious
 oppression, so they had a tradition--there 
is a very strange population who understands opp
ression and that's why when we were in 
Brive--actually the assi stant ma yor, his wife was a music teacher--the assistant ma yor 

was also I think a prin
cipal in the school.  
 

01:16:20 

 
 Both of them were very flattered to have
 city people from Antw
erp, and especially we  
were very good in Latin and Greek, all of us
, the three children were so religious in 
school and my youngest sister wa
s a musician, she was one of
 those--she had given in 
Antwerp a concert--the teacher four years. She wa s Wunderkind,
7
 I mean s he was good, 
so they were very flattered to have these pe
ople, and they didn't  ma ke any discrimi natory 

at all. They were very nice people and the fa
rmers, they were just interested in us.  
 

01:17:00 

 

 I must tell you, incidentally, that 40 years la
ter I came to that vill
age and went to the 
far m, and there I found my co-farm boy, who ha
d become in the meantime the owne r of 
the farm, and the first thing that I came in--the woma n came i n and says, ﬁWho are you? ﬂ 

and I said, ﬁI was a refugee here 40 years 
ago,ﬂ she said, ﬁAre you Arthur or David?ﬂ 
David was the other boy, and Arthur is my 
real name , actually. And she said, ﬁYou know, 
we recently watched a program on the con
centration camps, and we were wondering 
whether you were still alive, or you had bee
n...ﬂ So, they really were nice people. And I 
keep in touch with my farmer friend ever 
since. As a matter of 
fact, I was there six 
months ago.

Q:  So you went to Agde, what-- 
 

A:  In Agde, that was the first big tragedy because we  had to leave again. Wh atever  
little we had saved from Antwerp, which was ve
ry little, it's what we could take with us. 
 

Q:  Under what circumstances that--d
id you get rounded up?  I mean what-- 
 

A:  No, there was a notification from 
the  police, ﬂYou have to report tomorrow 
morning to the train station.ﬂ We  were the onl
y, I think, Jewish fa mily there. There was a 
Luxembour g fa mily, a Jewish fa mily from Luxe mbourg who--I'm sorry, who was, who 

did not get called.  
 

01:18:35 

 

 We got called and I think because we were 
not Belgian nationals--there, you see, that 
thing, that stateless Jewish status. We then ha
d to report to Agde on 
a train and there a lot 
of people came from all over the various places
. It was a terrible shock. Agde was exactly 
how we had seen pictures of Dachau or some
thing like this. It's barbed wire. There had 
been people concentrated there for several 
months, including Czech refugees, you know, 
who had served in the army actually, and if they
 were Jewish, they we re there. Also it had 
been for a long time a concentration camp fo
r the Spanish civil war fighters, you know, 
who France had gradually betrayed--the first to come  over and then Blum
8
 actually had 
made some deal. Those were exactly like the 
barracks that you can see from Buchenwald 
or some thing. These were platform- - there 
were two tier platforms of wood, without--
with--some straw which had remained fr om--it's 
full of lice and fleas. They gave each of 

them an old blanket--each of us. There was one--wome n wer e  sent, women and children 
were separated in a different camp a nd they ha
d a little bit of a bett
er camp because they 
had some  stoves in there, we didn't. It 
was very cold, it was wi ndswept, it was a 
mi serable camp. There was one faucet outsi
de  for--I think there were 14,000 people in 
there at one point--and then it 
froze. There was no water. We  used to get one soup and a 
rather mildewed bread every day.  
 

01:20:40 

 

 And then in the evening we used to get so
me other--if the thing 
wasn't  frozen, if the 
faucet wasn't frozen--we had some  c ooking. It wa s a mi serable camp. I reme mber we 

were freezing, we were mi s--we were eaten by fleas and lice, and one or two of the 

people became actually crazy in there. Ther
e was no dispensary. The only places pe ople 
were aimi ng is to try to get the job at the 
commandant™s camp because that was a warm 
place and my sisters, one of my older sist ers,
 be cause she was, she was I think trilingual, 
and she was taking shorthand or something. 
She worked for the commandant of the 
camp--commandant and also another family from
 I think elsewhere. Levine and these are 
the two fami lies that were actually later on li
berated. About three months after we were 
there, my sister obtained from one the--y
es, that wa s when de Lattre de Tassigny(ph),

who was the préfet
9
--préfet is like the governor, but it 
was an appointed préfet--and he--I 
don't know what happened. Yeah, he was the "Pré
fet de Police" and he came  and visited 
that camp and because there was some for m
er Czech foreign legion of people, he got 
very indignant about the situation. He says, 
ﬁI want that camp disbanded, I don't want it 
in my province.ﬂ Instead of liberating the pe
ople, he just sent them to Rivesaltes. 
 
01:23:00  

 

 

Q:  Now, what did you do all day in th
is camp, if you were there for months? 
 

A:  Nothing. 

 

Q:  There wasn't work, or-- 

 

A:  Nothing. We just hung around freezing 
and waiting for food to be given and 
trying to escape. We ll, as a ma tter of fact, 
one of my cousins, his name  is Michael 
Brushkin, he was ma rried to a c
ousin of mi ne. He  lived in Fr
ance, he lived in Theonville, 
and he served with the Fr ench army. And 
I know that he was very, very outgoing and 
also he had a big--he had a shoe factory, I think, in Theonville. And some how it 

happened to move a lot of shoes or some thi
ng, and he bribed people with shoes because 
we didn't have anything, and he came to vis
it us in the camp, showing his military paper 
and acting as, "I'm an officer of the French
 army.ﬂ They let him in and he actually 
smuggled my youngest sister out 
on his bicycle. He came wit h 
a bicycle and just walked 
off with her on the back of his bicycle. He 
then managed, when my sister got a pass of 
one day, after the de Lattre de Tassigny vi
sit--the camp commande
r was a little shook up 
by the criticism he had s o he gave her and al
so this other girl, Mi
ss Levine, I think was 
her name --they got a pass and my c ousin some how must have known that there was a 

gentlema n in the Montpellier prefecture by th
e name  of Ernst I think was his name , he 
was a Alsatian, who was one of the early re
sistance people. He  ma naged to fix some  
things and sa id, ﬁIf you can prove that they 
can live--survive--I can ma nage to get them 
out of the camp before it moves to Rivesalt
es, but they'll have to live in a suburb where 
all the parolees and people who were on paro
le or former convicts who had no right to 
live in the city.ﬂ And we were given--we were 
allowed to rent-- a little shack there in that 
city. And we lived with these people were ve
ry nice and they had an advantage since they 
knew all the police and always warned us if 
there was some thing stirring if people were 
trying to get after us, and they sort  of protected us. There's no antisemitism there, 

amongst the parolees. They were liberated in
 the--we were in dur
ing November, I think, 
by January or February, '41, no--yeah--'41. We  
were then liberated from the camp afte r 

three months in ther e and allowed to live ther
e, and again I we nt to work in vineyards, 
etcetera. I also registered in
 school actually, but I didn't s
how up too much there because 
in school there was a 
lot of antisemitism. 
 

Q:  This is in Montpellier?

01:26:00 
 

 

A:  Yeah. I wanted to get my degree, my baccalaureate, my, you know, secondary 
education, so when I was working the farms,
 occ a sionally I showed up in school. I was 
regist ered officially, but I didn't like it b
ecause there was a lot of antisemitism there. 
Every time, for example, the name of a Jew came up--Bergson,
10
 for exampl e, a 
philosopher we used to read--everybody wa
s saying, ﬁJew, Jew, Jew,ﬂ you know. And so, 
I didn't make--first of all I couldn't be ther
e too much; it was six kilome ters, or no, it was 
about 15 kilome ters of where we lived so it wa
s hard for me to get there and besides, the 
food shortage  was terrible in Montpe llier b
ecause Montpellier had only vine yards at that 

time. Jews also were sort of in line. We 
had special--we had identification cards stamped 
ﬁJuif,ﬂ
11
 and we also had ration car
ds stamped ﬁJuif,ﬂ so it was difficult some ti me s to get 
rations, you know. That was the only thing we 
felt. On the other hand, individual people 
in Montpellier were just ma rvelous. For exampl
e, my father, he had some , he had quite a 
bit of, had acquired in Belgium some skills 
in jewelry, old jewelry 
or some thing, and in 
old books, because you don't always interest an 
old book and he got to know an antiquity 
dealer by the name of Leyvastre. I mention hi
m because he really saved our lives two or 

three times and he just told him, ﬁ Whene
ver I buy some thing that you advise me , I 'll 
ma ke sure that you get some  percentage,ﬂ so 
that he helped us to live, on the one hand. 
On the other hand, every time there was some
 stirring up, where we heard that me n for 
example we re being drafted or Jews were--th
en he said, ﬁWell, come  and live with us. 
I'll--you'll--live with us fo
r a couple of weeks,ﬂ you know. He always had an excuse. 
ﬁYour son is very smart in school; he can 
tutor my  daughter, who's very shy, in Latin, 

and who flunked once the oral exams .ﬂ And I tuto
red her a little bit 
and later on he acted 
as if I had done a great deal to his famil
y, when he had saved our life by hiding us. We 
found out later that that daughter, that child da
ughter that I tutored, wa
s one of the heroes 
of the French underground, and we didn't ev
en know that. I mean, she was so shy and 
withdrawn, but her name  was Jeanne Leyvast
re. She married later her chief of the 
underground and had five children, moved 
to Bordeaux. I found this out later. 
 

Q:  Were there ma ny Jews i n the area, in
 that Montpellier suburb that you we re 
staying in?  
 

A:  There were no--I think we were 
the--yes--there was one other family, 
unfortunately. There was an Austrian couple, those were the only ones, an Austrian 

couple who was hidden in the--not just a bloc
k away from where we lived, because that 
was the country, that was--now there are a lot of
 in that area that has been developed into 
an area where ma ny of the Algerian refug
ees, ma ny North African
 refugees, after it 
became independent, have  settled in this 
very developed--and the vineyards have 

disappeared. I went there on one occasion, to vis
it it, and when we left there it was one of 
those desert, what they call the garrigue
12
, which is a very windswe
pt area with--it is very

hot and it just has very low bushes. It's  sort
 of a mosquito-infested; st one--it's a little bit 
like Israel some ti me s, you know
 whe r e--before it was settle
d. And so that's  where they 
had these little shacks with 
people living there who had been
 in the jail or had been 
some thing. 
 

Q:  Did everyone know you were Jewish? 

 

01:31:00 

 

 

A:  Oh, yeah. As a ma tter of fact, I had a neighbor who was, just, who sold me a 
terrible bicycle, but he was a real ex-convict, 
but he always gave us 
hints of what's going 
on. He said, ﬁ Watch out.ﬂ I don't know where 
he knew about it. No, they were nice and 

there was another girl up in
 another--Nadalié--we used to come  over and says, ﬁYou 
come  and listen to...,ﬂ he used to be gassed in
 WWI, ﬁ...come and listen to the radio from 
London, from the BBCﬂ  because we didn't have 
a radio. We  were not allowed to have a 
radio. We  didn't have anything in the house exce
pt a little old stove and five bedsprings, 
and that's  all we had in that place and our
 water came from-- was a 
cistern; it collected 
rain and when it didn't rain after November or
 some thing, I used to have to go every day 
and five miles with a wheel 
barrel that, again, my friend th
e convict Monsieur Durand 
had sold me , to get water. 
 

Q:  Was there presence of the Vichy
13
 police? 
 

A:  Oh, yes, there was. The Vichy, they were
 very, very active, that's  what I'm trying 
to--the ma yor, the ma yor was a fellow by the name  of Sudrier, who was a Vichy. He was, 
he was the one who was responsible freque
ntly of telling the suppliers, the butcher, 
etcetera, not to give us, but 
to put as at the end of any 
line that we come  in. He was 
always checking on us and unfortunately the 
person where the Austrian lived, they were 
Jehovah™s Witnesses and acted very officiously, 
but the ma n was working in the, in the, 
also in the ma yors office. He also was a form
er veteran of WWI, and they, I think, sold 
out again those refugees who were within the Au
strian refugees because they were sent to 
Auschwitz, and they never came back. But that's
 all and then we lived there as best we 
could. I used to work in vineyards an
d go to school occasionally and then-- 
 

Q:  Did you have a sense of
 fear or anticipation? 
 

A:  Terribl e, oh, all the time, because th
e rumors were going and the rumor mill was 
going all the time, and for one year we were not
 bothered until the early part of July of 
'42, you see. We  finally got there in '41. Even
 after the Americans got into the war, we 
were always trying to get to Marseille to try and get visas 
to America because we have a

large family in America, but we found out later why, you know, when we saw the 
Holocaust museum, the Friar(ph) thing that th
e consulate in Marseill
e had the orders to 
stall the Jews and not to get them ther
e. I don't know if you saw those papers. We  
realized it. And so we lived in treme ndous f
ear, especially after th
e Amer icans got into 
war in December '41 and then by July '42, then really we felt, we knew about camps and I 

think the rumor had started that Jews are going 
to be shipped to sort of work camps and 
some  of them ma y have been extermina
tion camps. They didn't know that there was 
active extermination, but we heard about 
Dachau and I think Buchenwald. We  knew 
about these camps, and we knew that people 
were starved there. We  didn't know about 

the extermination, which had started then. That we  didn't know, but we-- 
 

Q:  How did you get the information about this? 

 

A:  I don't know, the rumor mills were just incredible. And everybody always--we 
used to have these code words like, we ha
d a--we knew that, one or two things we knew 
is--one of my, as I me ntioned to you, the ol
dest sister of my mother and her husband, 
their girl--daughter and their 
granddaughter had been near 
the Pyrénées in a camp and 
they were repatriated. We  also knew that an
other sister of my mother, who also never 
came, went to Auschwitz and was--never came back. The third had been sent to Poland. 

That's  all we knew. 
 

Q:  How did you know this? 

 

A:  Because the daughter, because the daughter 
of the oldest sister of my mother, she 
ma naged to get--to smuggle out with her daught
er, to get from Belgium to the occupied 
area and from the occupied area to the non-occu
pied and because of that cousin of mi ne, 
Michael, who was in the army, everybody knew, 
had followed him. Because they went to 
Theonville and then they went to Nevers 
and then they knew that they were in 
Montpellier and she showed up one day in M
ontpellier--she had smuggled out. And then 
she told us that her parents had been told to
 report to Moulins. Th
at's the way it was and 
they disappeared and the same  thing the othe
r sister, that she disappeared and then the 
brother of my mother, the younger brother of
 my mother also was reported to go to 
Moulins and we knew that the son of one of 
my--had also reported, and then one of the 
other sons, who is still now in Belgium, he ju
mped off the train--from the train--and came  
back to Belgium and told that woman, that
 daughter, and then she subsequently was 
deported from Lyon. So that's  how we knew wh
at happened to our fa mily in Belgium, 

and we all knew that they were sent from 
Moulins to various places in Poland, so that's 
how we--but also the, there were some  people 
in Montpellier that my father was in touch 
with, Jews, and not the French. The French Je
ws kept apart. They 
thought they were not 
going to be touched; it was only the fore
ign Jews. But the foreign community in 
Montpellier knew about it and the rumor mill 
went and you see when we had my cousin 
Hela, the one that came from Belgium, and 
she told us about all these people who had 
been deported. They always said they had to 
go to Moulins and from Moulins they were 
sent away and we also knew about that boy, 
my cousin, who was my age, just a little 

younger, that he had been--he jumped from a train when he was, and he came  back to 

Belgium, where he hid. We had another 
cousin who's husband--who had just been 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
10 
 
ma rried just before the wa r--who's husband had 
been again sent to Poland, so we knew 
about those things, but we  didn't know. I mea
n, we all had this picture of Dachau and 
Buchenwald, which we knew from be fore the war. The horrible things happened, the 
people starved to death, you know and they'r e 
worked, and also two of my cousins had 
been in work camps and again the one that jump
ed from the train told us about it, so we 
knew about it, but I can't precisely know 
how it happens. And then we saw Agde, and 
Agde was a horrible camp and we knew also 
that the ma jority of the people who had 
been sent to Rivesaltes ha d been deport
ed to Poland, too. Again, the rumo r mill knew 
about it. It's funny thing is--because I didn't hear
 from Rivesaltes after that and then I ha d 
a book here about the camps in France and they
 say the result is the ma jor source of 
deportees of the zone libre
14
--non-occupied. All right?  And we go on and then when we 
got in in July of 1942. My father and I were 
again summoned to go to Agde, to Agde, to 
the camp, not the rest of the family. I--but  when I got the summons, I also had heard 

about--I was being, I was working. I had alr
eady registered with 
the mandatory rule 
group from- -  as students. I was registered 
in hi gh school. Actually I had, I successfully 
got my baccalaureate from there, which was a mi
racle, and so I had actually applied even 
to pre-me dical school, was refused. I had that
 certificate that  I was 
turned away because 
of--I didn't meet the quota of Israelites. And so
 I'd registered with all the students for 
ma ndatory work in France. I was working at
 that time near Montpellier, in a big 
communal garden, together with Indo-Chinese
. It was the Indo-Chinese for mer soldiers 
that they had. It was called the camp of
 Na m Phong for some  reason. Nam Phong: the 
five--I think Na m Phong means ﬁthe five provinces.ﬂ  
 

01:41:00 

 

 And I was there, working there,
 and fortunately I had registered
 with that  so that I went 
to--when I came  to Agde , I also ma naged to
 get some  kind of a  certificate from my 
father--a me dical certificate th
at he wa s ill, so when they couldn't get me , the young guy, 
because I was, I was, they couldn't supersede th
e ruler, the governme nt's r ule of service. 
They let me  go, so I didn't  go to Agde, I went
 to Agde the second time, but they let me  go 
and since they couldn't get me . The y let my fa
ther go, too. But Agde then had just been a 
sort of a holding camp to send to Rivesaltes out
 again. And so I went back and I went to 
the mountains with my group. Did a stupid th
ing because I went without the pass, and 
when I was there working in the fa rm in th
e mo untains, all the French boys gradually 
gave up because it was too tough, but I stayed
 there, so the farmer liked me . And I 
continued and then I got the le
tter fro m my fa mi ly that  they 
were in hiding because they 
had heard about--no-- they've come
 to be notified that we have to report and that's  when 
the father said he wasn't  going and he hid on th e other side of the city. They all went to 

one room claimi ng that it was a woman who was renting out rooms for people who had 

patients in the hospital. It was 
near a hospital, Saint Eloi, an
d so they were hiding there, 
and I got a letter in the mountains that they
 were hiding because they we re living there 
near the hospital because they were going to
 send them to where they send my Aunt 
Dora, which was the one that was sent to Poland. And so I came  back, stupidly, because I 

came without the--I di dn't  have a pass. I had 
to have a--I wasn't  with my group any more 
and I needed to have a pass, but I ma naged to
 get out of the stati
on where I noticed that 
                     
 
14
 Free zone (French). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306

there was a group of the black-shi rted milit
ia checking everybody on the train, and I ha d 
no pass, but there was a strange
 thing that the farmer had 
given me  a chicken, a scrawny 
chicken, and you know, we didn't have food a
nd I was bringing a chicken. There was a 
law at that time; France had still internal cust oms called an octroi
15
, and suddenly I said, 
ﬁ Well, I have to get that chicken through the 
octroi,ﬂ and so I went to another exit where 
there was no black guards and that's  how I got 
out of the station. I didn't realize at that 
time that that chicken saved my life and as 
I came out, I noticed a friend of mi ne, by the 
name  of Jack--Jean-- Ginsburg from Belgiu
m and I said, ﬁDo you know, by any chance, 
where my family is? ﬂ  He says, ﬁYes, I know, 
because I helped them move.ﬂ He was sort 
of--at that time he was dating my sister so he
 knew and he was a boy that I went to school 
with in Antwerp, Jean Ginsburg. And so he sh
owed me  whe r e my fa mily was and that's  
when I had this big idea, I said, ﬁOh, we can
't  be crowded like that,ﬂ my parents said, 
ﬁBut you know there are seals on our house, we
 can't  go back.ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I know--I 
have, I know where the key is of one of th
e farms where I lived, I worked, and why don't 
we take my two sisters and my
self? ﬂ  and we walked to the 
other side of the city, about 
eight kilome ters. I took my bicycle and we wa
lked and so I crossed the city, crossed the 

cemetery and ended up--but I forgot to tell--th
ere's a bridge again, th
e octroi, the internal 
customs and there was a militia man standing 
there and stopping us and sa ying, ﬁI have 
orders to round up all the foreign people,ﬂ 
and asked us, ﬁAre you Je
wish? ﬂ  ﬁYes.ﬂ ﬁSo I 
have to round you up.ﬂ I have no--I think th
e Belgian people don't have to be--and I had 
only a--my ID was an ID from school; it says I was born in Belgium. It didn't  say any 

nationality, but I had an olde
r sister who was born in Holland and he didn't know the 
rules, so he took us in and we found out th
at that was the big r
ound-up of Jews, French 
and foreign, that day. That was the 26th of 
August, 1942, where the ma
jority of the Jews 
of the free zone had been rounded up by the 
French and all deported. And we came there 
and we found the police station was full of 
people and he came, it was after mi dnight, he 
says, ﬁOh, I've got one more of them,ﬂ and 
that's when the person asked me , ﬁ Where...ﬂ--
the policeman-- ﬁWhere do they live? ﬂ  He 
says ﬁThat's why I caught them. I checked. 
They lived where they were caught, at the brid
ge,ﬂ and he said he 
would be willing to go 
to my house  and check and I said, ﬁDon't,ﬂ becau
se I knew that the seals were there. He 
took us there and that's  when we had this
 ma n sitting there. There was a commission 
sitting there, three people. One obviously wa
s a German. I don't--the reason why I think 
he was German is because he used a strange word for our ID items.  
 

01:47:00 

 

 The French used the word ﬁ coordonnée
16
,ﬂ the Germans used the word "Personalien.ﬂ
17
 
and he used the word "Personalien,ﬂ you know
. He says, ﬁTake that person out and let 
him go.ﬂ And he asked me , ﬁ What is your conf
ession? ﬂ  I said, ﬁ Wha
t's a confession?ﬂ He 
says, ﬁYour religion.ﬂ I had 
a mo me nt of hesitation and 
I said, ﬁJewish.ﬂ He had a 
mome nt of hesitation, he says, ﬁWell, since 
they live there, we know where to get them. 
Why don't  you let them go home? ﬂ
 So we went, fortunately not
 directly home , we went 
back to that far m where I had the key to--sle
pt there, which was about four kilome ters

from where I lived. And in the morning I deci
ded, since they had let us go, we probably 
are not looked for, and that's  where I me t 
our, my  friend the convict, the ex-convict, he 
says, ﬁAre you crazy?  What ar
e you doing here?ﬂ I said, ﬁWe
ll, we comi ng home because 
they caught us last night and they let us go,ﬂ
 He says, ﬁI have news for you, they must 
have ma de a mi stake, because they used 
to have three policemen watching your house, 
today they have six.ﬂ So we didn't go home  
and we kept being hidden for about two or 
three months until things calme d down. That happens all the time in France, you know. 
They make an action and then they forget a
bout it. And after two or
 three months hiding 
we went--by that time it was I think Septembe
r--no--it was October. You reme mber that 
ma n, that man in the prefecture by the name  of 
Ernst, and he arranged
 again to get us a 
complete absolution and we can go home .  
 

01:49:00 

 

 The seals have to be removed, we are no l
onger looked for, and then we lived there for 
another month until the Americans disembarke
d in Algiers. That's  Nove mber '42 and 
suddenly, the entire occupied--the entire non-occupied became occupied, that's in 

Nove mber, '42. Am I rambling too much? 
 

Q:  No, not at all, no, but 
I just have a few questions. 
 

A:  Good. 

 

Q:  This is great. Explain the seals on th
e houses. I don't think that everyone knows 
about this. 
 
A:  Oh, the French commandeered--the prie
st came in, that guy Sudrier, who was the 
ma yor, you know the guy with the militia ma n
--he came down with the police. I wasn't  
there, but my parents said they ran aw
ay and then one of my sisters, you know--
reme mber I may be what they call a Jewish
 stereotype now, looki
ng Jewishy, but at the 
time I was blonde. I had a lot of blonde hair. 
I'm blue eyed. In the south of France, I 
looked more southern French than any of th
e--the French in the south of France looked 
more Jewish than I looked. So my sister--one 
sister's  very blonde and blue-eyed, and she 
was not the Jewish stereotype the way they
 saw it, you know, they didn't take us as a 
Jewish stereotype. With age I became more 
Jewishy looking, but then I wasn't . And so 
one of my sisters went and she found that ther
e were big locks, seals. You see, we had a 
little shack there, it was sort 
of a, a little shack--just one ro
om and the kitchen and then a 
little room, two rooms upstairs, and then there wa
s a little garden and a 
gate, a little gate.  
 
01:51:00 

 

 That gate, they had put the seals on--wax s
eals--just like you put in 
a criminal thing, you 
seal the doors, so that you can't --if you open th
e door, you break the seals. It's the same  as 
they do for example if there's a murder case in America for example, they will put the 

seal on the doors so that you can't  open it. A
nd actually that night, after we were caught, 
when I walked back because I said, ﬁI'm 
going to come  back to the house,ﬂ and that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
13 
 
Durand, I hadn't me t Durand yet, but I had r
un into Sudrier, the ma yor and he says, 
ﬁ Where have you been?ﬂ And I said, ﬁOh, we 
we re told that ma ybe they're going to 
deport us and so he says, ﬁYou see this is all British propaganda,ﬂ I said, ﬁI know because 

I was at the policier
18
 last and they freed us,ﬂ he says, 
ﬁYou see?ﬂ But then that's when he 
probably called the police and they doubled
 the thing and that's  when Dur a nd, the 
neighbor, the ex-convict told us about it. Th
at's  the seals, see?  And for two months 

nobody could enter that little ga
te we had. I have actually pi
ctures of that little house 
now. 
 

Q:  So you had to stay put? 

 

A:  Yeah, we hid--I kept  up--because  they we
re tortur ing--the reason why I could stay 
at this gardener™s home is th
at poor guy was actually a Cypriot. His name  was Pascalis 
and he had been into--they decided a Cyprio
t is a British citizen, so they send him--the 
poor--the Pascalis, he was such an innocuous ma n, he was just a gardener who could 

hardly read. And so they send him as a Britis
h subj ect to a camp and interned him as an 

enemy alien, so his little garden--he had built
 a little house there, it was just a house--and 
he's  even dug his own well. And so since 
he was deported, his house was closed. But I 

knew where the key was and nobody ever bothered 
us, so I kept on going with my sisters 
to that house, and my par e nts were still conti
nuing to live near that
 hospital, that woma n, 
and Saint Eloi until they moved officially 
the seals and then we  moved bac k in that 
house. But we only stayed there for about three weeks because then I de cided I will no 

longer ever say I'm Jewish. I will join the 
underground and when the Germans move in to 
the whole zone in November, and that's -- 
 

Q:  Tell me a little bit about that, about when the Germans decided to occupy the 
southern-- 
 

A:  They just moved in--they didn't bother--
it was the, all this time, I must say, it was 
the French who bothered us, that was the Fr
ench, as I me ntioned to you over the phone. 
The French were much more zealous. The offi
cial French, much more vicious against--to 
apply the racial things, as fa
r as the governme nt's concerned, than the Germans. At that 
time they weren't there. Vichy Fr
ance was very, very anti-Jewish. 
 

Q:  Were there other examples of things th
at they did to you or other people that you 
can think of? The seals-- 
 

A:  The seals, the fact that we couldn't 
go to school, the fact th
at they stampe d our 
ration cards and our identification cards ﬁJ
uif,ﬂ which ma de it difficult frequently, 

because if you dealt with those--for example 
there was a great food shortage in the south 
of France and when you start in line, peopl
e queue for four o'clock and suddenly you 
come  with your ﬁJuifﬂ there, some time s pe
ople just pushed ahead of you and you weren't 
going to say anything about it. It's like in the 
occupied zone, they ha
d the yellow star we 
weren't yet to wear, but we had identity 
cards with ﬁJuifﬂ stamped on it which was 
annoying.

Q:  Were there any epis
odes of police brutality? 
 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  Nothing like that? 

 

A:  No, because we, unless we--yes--in th
e camp, yes. In the camp, for example, I 
was once hit by a guard because I was tryi ng 
to get to--I was asking for a pass to go to 

my mother, to where my  sister and mother we
re and he just hit me  and called me  ﬁdirty 

Jew.ﬂ No, those were instances, but you see we
 kept such a low profile that we didn't 
have any exposure and there was very few Jews
 in the areas where we were, or at least 

we knew about. No, that was sort of--Sudrie
r was the one and there was a lot of the 
newspapers were always attacking the Jews
 and if you wanted to be left alone, you 
usually ha d in your pocke t one of the most anti-Semitic papers called 
Gringoire,
19
 which 
was like the 
Der Stuermer,
20
 later the 
Der Stuermer
, in Germany. That's the only way you 
were left alone is when you always affected
 not, being anti-Jewish, 
but in school, like I 
said, in sc hool it was a ve ry anti-Semitic 
people were screaming, ﬁJew!  Jew!ﬂ every time 
there's a name  of a Jew, but otherwise, no. I personally had no--except for Agde--that's 

what I'm saying, except for Agde, and the two 
or three instances where we were almost 
deported and the fact that they 
sealed us out of our home, no. 
 

Q:  I think that we'r e almo
st  out of tape, is that...? 
 

A:  Well, there the Germans moved in. I 
joined the underground officially. I wa s 
sworn in by Toto, which was the name of the
--actually his name  is Otto Giniesky, but he 
was called Toto Ginot. 
 
Q:  This was in Montpellier?  

 

A:  Yeah. I joined them, but that was about 
all. I just--I just gave
 the oath and that's 
all and very soon after Germans moved in and 
so my parents again said we have to get 

out of this area, and we still was living w
ith my parents and we go to--and the few Jews 
that were there, including my cousin, who once 
lived in Montpellier, we decided to go to 
Grenoble and my sister went ahea
d, looking for a place in Grenoble. 
 

Q:  I'm going to stop you now so that they can change the tape, and we'll pick up. 

 

A:  Allright.

Q:  Before we move on, we were chatting off 
ca me r a  a little bit mo
re about daily life. 
 

A:  Daily life was mi serable;  it was a life 
of daily fear. You went to sleep, you didn't 
know if the next morning there would be 
a rounding up. We  knew about people rounding 

up. We  knew people disappear, for example,
 we knew--at one point it became  so 
worrisome  that reme mb er, I told you one ofmy cousins, the one, the only survivor from 

that--the oldest sister of my mother--she ma
naged to sneak out from with her daughter to 
the non-occupied and she lived with us. I for
got to tell you, she lived with us and her 
daughter, and her, because we were, we were such a large nuclear family. We were 

always raised together at Antwerp. And at one
 point they became so
 terribly--the rumor 

mill--that she decided she 
wasn't  safe in Montpellier, and 
she went to live near Lyon in a 
small city. And that's when they, they repor
ted--and the same time as we--the 26th of 
August or some thing--they rounded her up w
ith her daughters, Helen and Dian. Their 
name s were Helen and Dian. Her mother was deported and never came back. That 

woma n who finally lived with us--and she left
 us because she didn't feel it was safe any 

more--she wa s finally rounded up. The reason 
why we know, it is her daughter who was 
put in a camp of children and what happene
d is, it's one instance where the, where a 
bishop or a cardinal in Lyon--I think Gerlier--t
here's  a Catholic, there's called a Cathol ic 

organizations, they took a number of people, 
dressed them as police people and came in 
the camp and kidnapped all the childr en and pl
aced them with fa milies. The daughter and 
those people who adopted her 
notified us about the mother 
having disappeared and that 
Diane was alive and she was still with th
em, the Rosenstiels. She's still wonderful. 
 

Q:  How did you get enough to eat? 

 

A:  Oh, that's why I was working in the 
country. So we didn't
--in Montpellier it was 
horrible. As a ma tter of fact, there were ti
me s whe n I would go out on the country side, 
on the side of the road, and get dandelion so
 we could have salad once a day. And then 
we--you know, dandelion's a terrible diuretic. 
It was a terrible problem, but no, we had 
very little to eat, that
 is--that was--a horrible thing. A 
change, I mean in Grenoble, that 
was a big change, because in Grenoble you had to
 eat, but in Montpellie
r it was very little 
and the only--the reason is that's why I work
ed in the gardens, and with the farmers, 
because that's the only way I could have 
eaten, and see when I worked with the 

vineyards, we  would get wine as
 part of a salary and I would exchange the wine for food 
on the side. It was really terrible, and sometime
s my sister would get up at four o™clock in 
the morning because she heard there was so
me  ca rrots some where you know, and by the 
time her, by the time  the shop would open at ni
ne o'clock there were about carrots for 20 
people and if you had stamped ﬂJewishﬂ on them
, they wouldn't  give them to you, so it 
was nothing easy for life. But the food wasn't  easy for anybody.

Q:  One other question about when you sa
w there was southern Jews under Vichy: 
Did you have a sense of what the general att
itude was about the Vichy administration and 
the general French attitude? 
 
A:  The French attitude was favorable to
 Vichy, very much. And I can tell you this 
was going on in general, except for individual 
people. Some  individuals were absolutely 
wonderful, you know the old type of Cleman
ceaus, like the Républicains. But others 
would have a general attitude of anti-Jewis
h. All French have always been intellectual 
anti-Jewish anyhow, ever since Dreyfus, 
you know, Zola. But you have some  people like 
Zola or others who, you know, those were indi viduals. I must say the French population 

in the south was very, very pro-Vichy. They 
approved everything and they were sort of, 
sort of giving that feeling, well, everythi
ng was the fault of Léon Blum and his popular 

front, that Jews Léon Blum 
and Daniel Mayer and all th
ese guys, oh, there was an 
attitude. But individually, certain people are 
defi nitely against pers
ecution and when they 
knew you were in trouble, they were ready to
 help you. It's a dichotomy. I mean I have 
people, they were just wonderful. Oh, like these people that saved my niece, she's not a 

niece, she's a second cousin, yeah, whom I see
--she's  in Paris. But those were Catholic 
people. She, the woma n, was ma rried to 
a Jew, Rosenstiel, but she's the one who 
instigated this whole, this sa
ving of the children and kept ra
ising the child as Jewish so 
she wouldn't forget her gr andparents, because
 her grandparents were very religious. But 
the girl isn't Jewish any more, but she was. 
She tried. So these individual people are just 
sublime, that's what I'm saying. The sens
e of Vichy was extremely popular governme nt. 

They were listening to them, there were ve
ry few who were actually for the British. It 
may have been also the hate of the British and the hate of the leftist movement, which 

identified with the Jews, especially Lé on Blum. I don't know i f you re me mber Léon 

Blum, who was the Prime Minister who institut
ed all these beautiful, liberal reforms, you 
know. Social Security and all th
is that France has, all the 
workers even now that they 
have, they owe it to Léon Blum and his governme nt and yet they were so happy, ﬁOh, we 

got rid of all those Jews,ﬂ etcetera. Yeah, ther
e was a very anti-Jewish feel, but that's  not 
just France. I can tell you later on, even when
 I got to Spain, I faced this from the 
Belgians, who were, the Belgians who were offi cially on the British side. See, when I 

wanted to volunteer for the Belgians they 
said, ﬁWe can't  accept you,ﬂ and later on I said 
ﬁ Well, I had no papers,ﬂ and then when the 
other Belgian says, ﬁBut we never had any 
papers he says, ﬁI bet you're Jewish,ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁYes,ﬂ he says, ﬁ Well, yeah.ﬂ We  never had 

their attitude. He wouldn't like, even--the 
other people knew about it. So that's  not 
surprising. And that's  why we were always li
ving in fear. Every 
day we knew some thing 
is going to happen. And it did, finally it ha
ppened, it happened, at a tremendous scale, 
which is a mi racle that we  es
caped that. Never understood why.

Q:  So your fa mily decided to
 move to the 
Italian zone? 
 

A:  Yeah, and so my sister went out an
d found--as a ma tter of 
fact, she found a house 
at the outskirts of Grenoble. The Italians, 
who were ma king every e
ffort to protect the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
17 
 
Jews, I must say that, they were wonderful. 
So, as soon as we knew about it, again the 
great, I knew it, and the only thing the risk wa
s to get over to the It
alian zone without a 
pass and she me ntions to go back and forth 
and then our parents imme diately went over 
there. And I stayed with my sister to p
ack whatever we had and there again is an 
example. When we finally get to the stat
ion, there was a stati
on ma ster, grumpy guy. And 
we said, ﬁWe want to ship our belongings
 to this--ﬂ ﬁOh. You can't .ﬂ ﬁSay why? ﬂ 
ﬁJewish? ﬂ ﬁYes.ﬂ Then he says, ﬁIt's forbi
dden.ﬂ I asked, ﬁSince when? ﬂ  He says, ﬁSince 
today.ﬂ I said, ﬁBut that's all we have.ﬂ He
 says, ﬁFine. I just reme mbered, you shipped it 
yesterday.ﬂ The ma n didn't  know us, just an 
individual, that's what I'm saying. I have 
some  very, very wonderful me mories about indi
viduals, some  of whose name  I don't  even 
know. So we shipped our things, and by that
 time I came to Montpellier and discovered 
that my chief that I had--the chief 
of the Organisation Juive de Combat.
21
 It was first 
called AJ, Armée Juif,
22
 and then it was changed to
--you have the paper there--
ﬂOrganisation Juive de Co mbat.ﬂ And I acciden
tally ran in to him in Montpellier;  I was 
looking for a group. But then we said, he sai
d, ﬁBefore we can use you, you have to have 
French papers,ﬂ and he says, ﬁI don't know ye
t if I can trust them or you.ﬂ And so he 
handed me  over a discharge paper of some
body by the name  of Pierre Louis Vignot. I 
was a little older and I looke
d extremely young then, I was only about, I must have been 
just 19, but I looked like a 15, 16 year old boy. I 
was a skinny little rabbit, I mean, not to 
say skinny, I was skinny. I was about 125 pounds
 or some thing, and he gave me  that 
paper because the Asti Germans ha d moved in 
to the occupied, on the non-occupied zone, 
they disbanded the armi stice army, and so some
how, either the piece of paper was real or 
it was beautifully ma nufactured, because it wa
s a real di scharge certificate of a person by 
the name  of Pierre Louis Vinot, who was 
born in Béthune, and Béthune we found out 
later had been totally bombed. The city ha
d been bombed and all the papers of anybody 
born there were destroyed. So that was conveni
ent. He didn't tell me  how to do it, so I 
just went to the mairie
23
 or the city hall, where my pare
nts lived, which was a big mi stake 
because I wasn't  officially living there any 
more. Yes, the underground--he had assigned 
me  a room, a safe room that they had rented. 
 

Q:  InGrenoblenow? 

 

A:  In Grenoble. My parents lived six kilome
ters or 10 kilome ters out of Grenoble in 
Val d™Eybens. And I went to that ma irie 
because I didn't know any other ma irie and I 
reme mber being there and the man looking agai
n--it was one of those militia people, an 
older guy--and he looked at me , he says, ﬁCome 
back in the back here,ﬂ and I said, ﬁUh-
oh, he caught me .ﬂ  
 

Q:  The last I reme mber, you were talking 
about you were going to the city hall of 
the--

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306

A:  Yeah, and there was a militia, a chief of the militia, who was actually processing 
the--making identity cards. 
 

Q:  Okay, I remember, and the man said, ﬁCome with me.ﬂ 

 

A:  ﬁCome in the back.ﬂ 

 

Q:  [Referring to technical problems] Oka
y. Let's roll the tape. Oh, I'm sorry, I did 
pick up-- Oh, I'm sorry, okay. 
 

A:  Well, I went and I think there was a 
ma jor mi stake which could have cost --there 
was a major mi stake because I went there. I ha
d no address to give. When I went there I 
realized that the man in charge of the ID 
cards was a militia man, an offi cer, and he then 
went, after I filled out the papers, he filled out
 the papers, asked me  to come in back and 

looked at me  very sternly and I said, ﬁThere
. I am caught,ﬂ you know?  And all he said is, 
ﬁEyes blue, hair brown.ﬂ All he wanted was 
to have a look at me  because he wants to 
give the details, and then he said, ﬁWell...ﬂ
 and I knew that when you take an ID card, 
usually they fill out the papers and then th
ey st amp it and you go home . He said, ﬁYou'll 
have to come  back in two weeks from now,ﬂ
 and I said, ﬁWhy? ﬂ He said, ﬁ Well, because 
this--we don't  deliver cards any more . It's now very serious and we do it through the 

prefecture de police,ﬂ and I didn't know what, a
nd I said, ﬁFine,ﬂ and then I left. And then 
I went to see my chief and he says, ﬁThat 
was a stupid thing to do, but now that you did 
it, he™s either going to have--if you have th
e courage and you go there, you either--you'll 
be the only person in the enti
re region who's goi ng to have an identity without an 
accomplice, which means--ﬂ and then he star
ted to explain to me, because he says, 
ﬁYou're going to be assigned in the ma nufactur
ing of false papers and distributing false 
papers and br inging them over to various places
 as you can see on that
 certificate.ﬂ And I 
said, ﬁWhere is it? ﬂ and then he gave me  th
e explanation, he says, ﬁThere is virtually 
nobody who has what we call true-true-false pa
pers--false identity--and if you get that 
prefecture card, you're going to have the onl
y one with true-true-stamps. There's not 
going to be an accomplice, so you can never be caught.  
 

02:17:00 

 

 The second thing is...ﬂ then he explained to
 me, ﬁ...some of them you'r e going to make 
and we have rubber stamps and we have form
s that we buy,ﬂ etcete
ra. ﬁThey're not going 
to be perfect and those are called false-false-
false papers. Then there's going to be--you'r e 

going to have contacts as you're going on, you're going to work in ma iries, and we'r e 

going to find some  people who we can bribe 
and they'r e going to make it at the mairie 
and keep a record, but that's  some body who's not
 totally reliable--that's  going to be the 
false-true-false papers. And then we'r e goi
ng to have--somewhere we'r e going to have a 
person that is one of ours in the ma irie, he's
 a resistance. But he 
can be caught and under 
torture he can tell, that he's  going to be agai
n. And those are going to
 be true-false-false 
papers. So that's going to be the different categ
ories of papers.ﬂ And that's  after he says, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
19 
 
ﬁBut we'r e only going to use you after you ha
ve your own papers, so...ﬂ I don't like 
myself in that picture, so that's , I look like my uncle. 
 

Q:  Let me  ask you a few questions before we-- 

 

A:  Did you pick that up, these categories? 

 

Q:  Yes, yes. Before we learn more 
about your underground work, I just want to 
understand, your whole family is now in Grenoble? 
 

A:  Yes, my whole family. I am the only one
 at that point who is
 not living with my 
fa mily; they don't even declare me  wi th them
. And we know that there is a comparative 
safety as compared to Montpellier, wh
ere we were under Vichy, but with German, 
Germans looking down on them, and their trage
dy. The Italians prevent this area under 
their control to be as mean as the Vichy 
and the German zone. As I me nt ioned to you 
until--you asked me  if Grenoble, 
the trip of Grenoble, the only
 risk we took gravely is 
that we were traveling back and forth be
tween Grenoble and Mont
pellier during this 
move, without the proper papers, which is, whic
h could have led us di
rect to Auschwitz. 
You see, the trains frequently were in the 
control, were controlled by field gendarmerie,
24
 
together with the French police. This is one 
of the things that I wa
s doing, too--later on--
is traveling and knowing where to come  up, etcete
ra. I learned that late
r, but at that time  
we just took terrible chances and you know th
e atmosphere of taking a trip like this and 
knowing that you are going to be caught, you have
 a 50 percent chance. It was a terrible 
ordeal, but we did it and that
's what I'm saying. It's the only problem that happened. 
 

Q:  Now, when you decided 
to join the underground-- 
 

A:  That was in Montpellier. 

 

Q:  Right. How did you know about it?  Ho
w did you decide what organization to 
join?  How did all of this happen? 
 

02:20:00  

 

 

A:  I me t a young ma n. That was a pure accident. I don't re me mbe r  his name ... Abie--
his name  wa s Abie, a little fellow. He used to
 be from Antwe r p. He used to be the son of 
the baker, the ma n who delivered our bread. He
 met me once accident ally in Montpellier, 
astonished that I was there and then told 
me  about the existence of the underground in 
Montpellier. I don't know what happened to hi
m because he was not in Grenoble later on. 
And he told me , ﬁ You know, you should join. 
There is a new underground here,ﬂ and he 
is the one who got me  in touch. We  used
 to call him Abie the baker boy, you know, 

because he used to come  in the morning and 
we liked him very much. He used to deliver 
bread in Antwerp to us. He was a Polish little
 fellow. And he is th
e one who talked me  
into--if I hadn't  met hi m, I don't think I woul
d have ever known about it and that's  how I 
                     
 
24
 Total force of the gendarme (French). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
20 
 
joined the underground and then again, when I came  to Grenoble--oh, no--I me t him 
again in Grenoble. When I was in Grenobl
e, you know, it's--I happened to come  down 
from--and there he is again. And I said ﬁA
bie, what's  going on? ﬂ and he says, ﬁYou 
know, the same  people are here,ﬂ and then he
 said, ﬁYou me t them in the dark, but I 
know you can meet them in the light.ﬂ I don'
t know what happened to Abie after that 
because he was not part of our group later on. 
 

Q:  So there wasn't  an agreement in Mont
pellier to meet with
 certain people once you 
arrived in-- 
 

A:  No, no, because you see, it was only the--almost two days before I left 
Montpellier that I joined, it was a very secr
etive--and that's  maybe why Toto, the chief, 
acted a little bit strange in
 the beginning, because it was such a secretive thing, you know. 
It was in the dark, you made an oath in the 
dark on a revolver. I mean it was--I thought it 
was a lot of--I was sort  of a little cynical
 about it and maybe I acted a little bit 
supercilious or something because I think Toto
 told me in the beginning he was very sort 
of diffident, you know. That's  ma ybe why he 
handed me  that discharge paper saying the 
hell with it, he's not--I'm not going to do anything
 special  for him, but when I got the real 
papers and when he saw that I have guts, 
because he said, ﬁNow it's up to you,ﬂ and I 
said, ﬁWould you go? ﬂ he says, ﬁThe only th
ing I can tell you, if you ever get those 
papers, you have the best papers
 and you're going to be very 
useful to us. On the other 
hand, I'm not sure if I would do 
it in your place becau
se there is a big risk involved.ﬂ And 
I said, rather than-- ﬂif I want
 to do a thing, I'm not joining the underground not to take 
risks.ﬂ So I took the risk and got my papers. 
 

Q:  Wa s Toto also in Grenoble? 
 
A:  Oh, yeah, Toto was in Grenoble. I had 
an--I never met hi m except in the dark, that 
single day in Montpellier. 
 

Q:  So the whole organization moved? 

 

A:  The whole organization moved. He
 actually created, I think, the whole 
organization, and he and some body by the na
me  of Si mon Le vitte created--I think he 
must have been stimulated by Simon Lev
itte who was a ma rvelous guy--created the 
organization in Grenoble. They 
even rented a little chalet 
in the mountains called Le 
Michallons where gradually all 
those people started getting to
gether, and it was sort of 
officially an area where young people got togeth
er to sing songs and 
things like that, but 
really it was the center. There were two cente
rs at that time, one was in the kitchen of 
Miss Madame  Latchiver in Grenoble. 
 

Q:  Who was sh e? 

 

A:  She was just a wo ma n who--a Jewi
sh-Frenchwoman--who was a widow with two 
children, who some how got to know the--I 
think she knew the wife of Toto, and 
gradually everybody found it convenient to come  
to her, and she said, ﬁYou do whatever 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
21 
 
you want,ﬂ and in her kitchen was actually the-
-in her stove wa s all the rubber stamps and 
everything was there. And we used to have 
these, all these sessions in he r places and 
people who came from hiding for a day or two 
always slept in her place. She was the 
center of activity in Grenoble 
and the second place was up in the mountains in Michelon. 
That's  where I got to be assigned of manufact
uring and distributing papers. I wasn't  the 
only one. I was one of them, and then later on 
in Grenoble the Italians had set up two in 
our area, two nice resort villages that b
ecause of the war weren't used. Wh ere they 
concentrated Jews in various hotels, 
they called it résidences surveillées,
25
 but they 
claimed that this would be th
at they felt that  one day the 
Germans will push them out and 
then they will take thei r Jews to Italy where they'r e less persecuted, which isn't true, 

because they were persecuted.  
 

02:26:00 

 

 I mean the Finzi-Contini
26
 thing, you know, but they had--they meant well and actually I 
think Toto had, from what I understood, had 
connections with the Italians and had 
received their guarantees and that's  why we
 left the Italians alone. There was never 
anything against Italians
 by the underground, at least by the Jewish underground. 
 

Q:  Well, in Grenoble, just the general scen
e, were there a lot of refugees there from 
all over?  
 

A:  I don't know, again, I was not in the 
ma in group. I was just with the underground. 
There were quite a few, yes, because inthe underground we'r e all Jewish and we were 

quite a group there. But I was ma inly having 
a small group of very active people, one of 
them is George Schneck who became--is now th
e president of the Jewish Consistory in 
Brussels, of the whole thing. Another one wa
s Adolph, who went to school with me  in 
Antwerp, who then later on became ambassador 
in Peru, of Israel, he  was one of the 
Shin-Bet people, and there was Toto. There 
was a pretty large group but we didn't know 
much about them because we didn't want to know much about them in case we get 

caught. There was an infiltration of Communist
s, and I think earlier, when you asked me 
in the begi nning was there ever anybody I didn't trust, I trusted them, but then became 

very suspicious about two guys, Joe and Max. Max later on became a big wheel in the 

French Communists after the war,
 and their girlfriend Charlott
e. I think they were selling 
us down the road some where because some  peop
le got caught, and I wonder if it weren't 
those people. The second th
ing is the French underground 
had nothing to do with us. 
They wanted us, to use us only to get the money. They had this idea Jews have mo ney. 

And we had very little to do with them. But 
you see, I had a very fine--reme mber I joined 
them in November--didn't see them until Decemb er or January and only st ayed with them 

from January until August, with our group. So our group had definitive jobs for me. I was 

ma king fals e papers, I was distributing fals
e papers, I was explor
ing because of my 
far ming skills, I worked with farmers again, a
nd I used to go out with George or others 
and look for hiding places, should we  start, 
because we were preparing to become  a 
fighting group. At that time  we were not ye
t a combat group, but we
 were preparing to 
                     
 
25
 Supervised residences 
 
26

The Garden of the Finzi-Continis. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
22 
 
become  a combat group. And so I was going e
xploring with fa rmers, where we could 
have hiding places, where we could ha ve stra
tegi cally located places, and that was my 
job. In addition to that, I had to bring--oncewe had ma nufactured papers--I had to bring 
them to Saint-Gervai s, to Megève, to Nice. 
I also was a sort of a liaison to Toulouse, 

which was in the occupied zone, because they
 felt I had been several time s going back 
and forth without a pass, some how I had an in
tuitive feeling on how 
to get people across, 
and so some times I was just sent over to l
ook, to which they say, ﬂthe family's  comi ng,ﬂ
27
 
just go in the train and wa
tch what happened and when you go down and you feel that 
there's an inspection comi ng, just get down th
e train and stay, so I did it a few times. 
 

Q:  And what would you do? 

 

A:  I would just go, I would just sit there in
 the train while they were there and then 
when I would look out and I see there's a 
field gendarmerie. I would go down the train 
and they would go down the train, too. And th
en when I thought it 
was clear I would go 
back because I couldn't talk to them, you s
ee. Once I--a funny story happened--there was 
a Jewish family who, they had good papers so nobody's--and then the Ge rmans and the 

Frenchmen came in and there was a farmer, 
a typical 100 percent farmer. He was eating. 
He had a sandwich, he was eating onion, and 
so suddenly the French policeman said, 
ﬁYou must be Jewish,ﬂ and there was this w
hole group of fa mily who were Jewish, they 
had false papers, but they were Jewish, and 
they bothered this farmer because he was 
eating onion. You know if it wasn't  so trag
ic, I would have laughed, because he says, 
ﬁYou are Jewish.ﬂ He went to check him, 
brought him back later on, let him go. But these 
are the kind of things. I was bri
nging them papers, then, just to ma ke sure that they get 
themselves out of the trouble, I would show them where to go down, where to go up 

because I traveled a lot and I knew where it was sa fe. 
 

Q:  Now as Pierre Vinot, you were 
just considered a Catholic Fr ench? 
 

A:  Yeah, well, I was living in that pla
ce, number 16 Grande Rue, above a bordello, 
and it was a safe haven because you see, again, 
they had picked that pl ace and on the first 
floor there was a bordello, because  there wa
s a red light , and so they had picked up 
because you could go in and out. And then I 
had this apartment where this woman was 

living, and I had a little room 
there, and I wasn't  there much either, because most of the 
time I was in the farms all around, so traveling a lot. Many time s I was sleeping at 

Madame  Jeanne, this famous Madame  Jea
nne Latchiver; she was a ma rvelous woma n. 

That's where I got to meet all these peopl
e who later on were deported, like Marianne 
Cohen, Mila Racine--all these 
people who tried to get chil
dren over and they betrayed 
them. Some body betrayed them, I don't 
know who--around there--Laubert(ph). 
 

Q:  Tell me a little bit about the process 
of ma king all these papers and distributing 
them. 
 

A:  That's what I explained to you. Number
 one, we had--somehow we had a printer, 
he was a Communist. He was Gregoire I thi
nk, he had a printing shop. I didn't have much 
                     
 
27
 According to the interviewee, this 
wa s a code phrase that the group used. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
23 
 
to do with him, it was Toto again. He would 
print us the forms , he would ma ke us the 
rubber stamps, okay? 
 
02:33:00 

 

 These forms --we would just get the pictures, 
have the form where th
ey were just rubber 
stamps, because my pape rs had the wa termark print, you know the--tha t was different. If, 

in an emergency where we had to have 
quickly some  people come  over fr om, yeah, 
fa milies comi ng fr om the occupied zone w
ho would send--I would go over ther e, bring 
them the papers, but we would ma ke them. 
Thes e were little car
dboard kind of, kind of 
cardboard kind of for ms. They fold and you f
ill them out and you stamped them, and they 

were given. They'r e worthless because if ev
er they would check--can I, can you stop one 
second?  I have to blow my nose. See, they
 were worthless because if anybody checked, 

really, if the police would have any suspici
on, they would get those people over, just 
ma ke a phone call to a ma n, you know--there were
 no computers then, but just call and 
said, ﬁDo you have any registration? ﬂ I woul
d say no, so they were totally false. They 
were false-fa lse-false papers. Also we  had 
a few people in areas like Domè ne, etcetera, 
where I didn't  know wha t  the difference was except that I used to go and pick them up. I 

sit in small city halls. I ca
ll them mai r ies, you know that
's--we used to have either 
employees there, who are accomplices because
 either they were doing it for money or 

they were resistance. I di
dn't know the difference between
 them, but they would say 
ﬂToday, go to Domè ne...ﬂ for exampl e, ﬁ...Dom
ène, and you pick up a bundle of things.ﬂ 
These were registered. In other words, you ha
d the background papers 
there. If the police 
called, the guy would say ﬁYes, they are he
re, these people,ﬂ but you had a weakness--
they had an accomplice. That accomplice 
could be some body that we thought was 
trustworthy, in which case they 
were true- false-fa lse; or wh
ere there were two true-false; 
or the guy could be trusted, in that case theywere true-true-false. I mean we had all these 

things, and I would pick them up and bring 
them over. Now there was always a danger 
there, either a person was caught and some
body was waiting for me  to come  and pick 
them up or the people was a double agent or 
some thing like that. It never happened. 
 

Q:  Were you afraid constantly that it-- 

 

02:36:00  

 

 

A:  No, I was only afraid that if they 
would stop me  I would become  nervous and I 
would show that there's some thing wrong. I wa
s never--that was a st
range thing, not even 
when I, the most difficult part, even the da
y that I was conduct--I 
don't know was. I think 
it's the youth, the fact that our lif
e was so tense all the time, that
 these things seemed to be 
sort of a relief. I don't reme mber, looking back that I was afraid, ex
cept, for example, I 
reme mber one day comi ng back from Saint-Ge
rvais, where I had just given all these 

papers to the people, distributed them, cam
e back, had nothing, and suddenly there was 
big, ID check, I'm sorry, ID check. The police wa
s there, the militia was there, et cetera. I 

wasn't  afraid for me, because I had the--but 
I was afraid that I mi ght not look relaxe d and 
that they would see I'm nervous and then they
 would start asking them and then I, I mi ght 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306

betray. I was much more afraid ever to be 
nervous and to betray 
people, but otherwise I 
wasn't . And so this was about the life, I wa
s also the liaison person 
with Toulouse at one 
time. Toulouse was the other, was the real bi
g center. We didn't--I didn't--know that, but 
that's where Polonski, who was known at the 
time by the name  of Pol, was running a big 
operation where most of the people after I left
 of Grenoble moved to, and Toto moved to 
Grenoble, to Toulouse, because that became the big center because at one time when the 

Germans, when the Germans occupied even the Italian zone, there was no more reason to 

have two centers. So a small group was left in 
Grenoble. My two sisters, who before I left 

joined the underground, became muc h more activ
e than I, because then they had become 
more of a--they started using the places th
at I had found. They also were much more 
active in the false papers business. And I th
ink one of my sisters even got hurt at one 
point, you know. 
 

Q:  Did you have much sens e of the overa ll organization or did you really operate 
with a few people? 
 

A:  Very little sense. I think the organi za
tion was still very disjointed. Our operation 
was one operation and we thought it was all. I only
 got an inkling later, in Toulouse, but I 

didn't realize that Toul ouse was the majo
r center. I only got--when it became --when I 
became, I wanted to tell you, after a certain ti
me  I could not use--I could not stay Pierre 

Vinot because as Pierre Vinot I was born in 
1919, four years older than I really was.  
 

02:39:00 

 

 There was suddenly--the French had suddenl
y ma de an order that all people born after--
before--1921 had to report to go to Germ
any. You had to go, ma ndatory labor, for 
Germany. At least you had to register, and so 
I could no longer be Pi
erre Vinot, and I had 
to become  Arthur Vergnaud. I think it was 
still Pierre, I have to reme mber. I don't 
reme mber because they weren't exactly good, 
there was not longer any good for anyone it 

was one of those little cards ma de by Domè
ne. I reme mber the ma irie, at which point, 

one morning, I--I used to sneak in very early 
in the morning at six o'clock in the morning 
to my where my parents lived to chop the 
wood and bring them some ti mes the food that I 

had collected in the farms. And I come  ther
e in the morning and there is a little girl , 
Fischer, she was a neighbor, 
and she came to me, and she sa
ys that--she came  to the 
streetcar and she came up with a little milk thing and she says to me , ﬁYou go and pick 

up the milk,ﬂ and I couldn't understand this lit
tle girl. She was ma ybe nine years, 11 years 
old--nine years. She says, ﬁPolice,ﬂ and so
 I knew I couldn't go home , and so I went. 
Later on I discovered they got my poor father
 and my sister, took them all the way to 
some where, and they grilled them all day 
long by saying, ﬁWhere is your son? ﬂ and he 
says, ﬁMy son is only four years old.ﬂ ﬁNo, 
no, no, the other one, the one that's in the 
resistance, the one that worked there on this 
farm and there on this farm and he's in the 
underground and he distributes flyers,ﬂ and 
they didn't know what I was distributing so 

they thought I was distributing propaganda
, you know--he's in the underground. And so I 
knew that somebody had betrayed me because they didn't even know my name, they just 

knew that I existed and they knew how I looked, 
and so at which point, when I told this 
to Toto because he didn't know about it, he 
said, ﬁWell, I can't use you any more, but we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
25 
 
can use you now because we do want to have 
more liaisons to Toulouse and we would 
like to ma ke  a channel and you be the guinea 
pig with whoever you wa
nt to recruit to go 
to Spain,ﬂ and I said, ﬁBut I t
hought that Spain is impossible.ﬂ  
 
02:42:00 

 

 He said, ﬁExactly. That's why we want
 you to try it,ﬂ because nowadays nobody had 
crossed to Spain for the last
 year--smuggled in, because 
you have a borde r area. You 
have 50 kilome ters which is zone interite.
28
 If they catch you, they shoot you, if you don't 
have a certain color pass, and so it's almost 
i mpossible to get over, but we have a passer 
who we want to use and Toulouse is looking 
for volunteers that ar
e desperate and then 
ultimately we'll set our goal that you should th
en try to ge t to Palestine at that time  
because--I forgot to tell you that the, at that
 time  the AG, or the OGC was very Zionistic. 
All wanted ultimately to get to Palestine, 
and so that's what I'm saying was so--it was 
such a come dy because they kept on saying, ﬁY
ou go to Toulouse and then you try it and 
then within 48 hours you have to
 report to Barcelona, to our 
agent in Barcelona and they 
will get you over to...ﬂ That was nonsense becaus
e it di dn't exist, this whole channel was 
sort of just a trying fiel d. So the first tim
e--I then went with George Schneck, my best 
friend, we were buddies and, you know, brothers, 
and I went to Toulouse again, without a 
pass, without, but I, then I was where I knew.
 And I got to Toulouse. We  were hidden at 
that time and we were trained for weeks 
by--in the home of Madame  Knout. Her name  
was Rachel Knout, K-n-o-u-t. 
I me ntioned to you she was th
e granddaughter of Scriabine, 
and she was not Jewish but she was ma rried
 to Knout who was a big wheel in that 
organization and--oh, no--he was deported, I 
think. Yeah, Knout was deported, yes. And 
Rachel Knout, she was a wonderful woma n, with her children there, she remi nded me of 

that Madame Jeanne because she had about four
 or five children. She had the little--and 
everybody was hiding there, and she was active.
 She was shot later on, on the 28th of 
July, 1944, she was shot. There was also anothe
r guy by the name  of Gerard and he also 
was shot, later on. And then they send me
 and George to Nakache. Nakache was a 
Olympic champion of s wi mmi ng--swi mming ch
ampion of 1938 or some thing like this. 
He had opened the gymnasium and he trai
ned people physically for the underground. 
 
Q:  He was Jewish? 

 

A:  Yeah, Nakache was a, Nakache was a--but they didn't know that, see, Nakache 
was an Algerian Jew or a Moroccan Jew or so
me thing like this, Nakache. And he trained 
us you know, etcetera, and then what happened 
it--George's family, his mo ther was, she 
was from Russia and she was absolutely against him continuing because she said she 

knows the nihilists, and we'r e probably going to
 be--because they did train us how to 
jump from trains and things 
like this and so she, I don't know
, George decided he wasn't  
going. So I had to go all the way back to Gr
enoble and try to recruit different people, 
which I wasn't , it wasn't  such a good bunch becau
se George and I were really idealistic 
and these other guys, they just wanted to get 
out. I got five people, one I didn't know, he 
was from M egève, and I had Nick, Charles 
and the brothers Le vine. And in Toulouse 
they gave me  another guy that was from An
twerp, Ar ma nd Herchkowitz, he was the sixth 
                     
 
28

us,ﬂ meaning ﬁdeathﬂ (Latin). 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
26 
 
guy. So I got six guys and the French underground gave us five more people and I 
became in charge of this group. 
 

Q:  You said the French underground gave you more  people? 

 

A:  Not me . Yeah, the French underground, lik
e I said, they did not work with us, but 
Pol Polonski and Jack Roytma n, who were the 
two guys in Toulouse, told us we--because 
the French underground apparently furnis
hed--supplied--the passer. The Jewish 
underground was financing it, see that's  where we-- 
 

Q:  But there was a relationship?  

 

A:  Oh, yes, there was a relationship, but 
it was not the real --it 
was sort of a--you 
could feel a sort of contempt: ﬁYou provi
de us with money,ﬂ you know. There was no 
other interchanging except that I was told in
 Toulouse, ﬁYou're going to get whatever you 
get. There are going to be five guys and you'
re going to be responsible for them, too.ﬂ 
 

Q:  There was no sense of a common enemy? 

 

A:  Yeah, but that way, like 
I said, in '43, the population wa
s still very, very pro--not 
real pro-German, but anti-British, anti-Jewis
h, and I'm not sure th
at the--and I had the 
feeling that the French underground was had 
only started, the ma jor, the most strongest 
part of the Fr ench underground were the Commu
nists. They were really anti-Germa n, 
because they were anti-Russian, not for a
ny other reason. They were very unconcerne d 
with what they did to the Jews, and they 
couldn't care less. The Jewish underground was 
simply because they felt, otherwise they
 would have been part of the French 
underground, but they felt that there 
was discrimi nation against the Jews. 
 

Q:  So their goals were different? 

 

02:48:00  

 

 

A:  Their goals were different. The Je
wish underground, the way I knew it, both in 
Toulouse and--had an aim to get the Jews as
 muc h as they could, either fighting the 
Germans or getting them to Palestine. That 
was at that time--the Jewish resistance was 
very Zionist-oriented. The Commun
ists that infi ltrated them 
tried to switch it differently, 
made them Communists. The French sort of ignored them except when it came to--at 

least in my time. Now later on, I think toward
s the very end, they were working together, 
but you see the French resistance, no ma tter 
what they say, was Johnny Come  Lately, you 
know, all those people that you 
see in movies, etcetera. 
 

A:  Even the second D.B.
29
 friend, who went through th
e same  place without the 
French underground, went the same  passage and he
 joined the French army in Algiers, he 
also said that was, first of all, he coul
d have done without us, secondly they were so 
                     
 
29

d division), (French).

antisemitic in these, in the French army. The 
French army of liberation, de  Clercq and all 
these people, were terribl e antisemites. So 
I got to Toulouse, I was hidden once in M--by 
Rachel Knout. I got the training, 
I we nt back, I recruited five 
people, they gave me  a sixth 
one, then after a couple of days they, Pol a
nd Jack, they gave me  instructions how, what 
to do. We got to some place which- -it was my memory, I have such a great me mory, I 
can't  reme mber that place--and there we were
 hidden in the barn. We  got the five 
Frenchme n with us, the five non-Jewish guys
 and we--and then--his name  was Bertrand 
Borde, yeah, he came. He was about seven foot
 tall; no secret that I'm a pretty shor t guy, 
and most of the people except one Frenchma
n, one, he was a law student, was the only 
tall guy. All the others were re
latively--I mean my size or even
 shorter, and he took us for 
two days in the mountains on a absolutely in
credible tempo. Then they abandoned us in 
the mountains, and then we had another two 
days without food in the mi ddle of storms, 
etcetera, and we finally got to Spain. 
 

02:51:00 

 

 

Q:  Now, tell me a little bit about that 
journey to Spain. Wa s this a fairly easy 
crossing? 
 

A:  Oh, no, this was a horrible crossing. As 
a matter of fact, the 
team--the team after 
us I think lost three people
. Two died and one broke his leg and they had to abandon--
they don't know what happened and the 
next team didn't ma ke it at all. 
 

Q:  Why was it so horrible? 

 
A:  First of all it was--you start off almos t
 in open thing--in fields where there are 
German villages, for example. Whenever you crossed, you crossed towards dusk because 
at night you couldn't see, and when we passed 
any of those villages, for example, there 
were Germa ns in there. And you have to reme
mber, when we passed I had to start--let's  
see--no, I was always the last one because 
the guy before that, 
the passer would go, and 
then when you hardly see the passer. The ne
xt one would go, and by that time  it became  
dark. Then you had to get into fields that 
go up like this where the people who work in 
those fields are attached by co
rds to work in the fields, you 
know, with a sickle. Then you 
start, then it became so bad that you have to
 do it in daylight, and you're absolutely a 
target there. If they see you, they shoot you. 
You don't have a pass. Th
e terrain is terrible. 
After the fields you get into the most horri
ble rocks and you know the mo untains goes up 
and it goes down. It's north of Honduras a
nd, for example, in the mountains, when you 

are on the top and you want to start going down, you don't realize that when you go down 

let's say 100 feet, there's nothing underneath 
and some  of our people almo st died this 
way. There was this guy that 
I got from Megève, he was th
e most undisciplined guy ever, 
and he would just go down there and then he
 would stop because he almost fell. These 
were extremely dangerous and then there 
were paths where you had about, I don't know, 

this much to slide on the side. I coul dn't  
do it now, it just how we 
did it. It was just 
horrible and at time s the guide did us--made us
 do it in the mi ddle of the night, and when 
I found out what we were doing with the morning when we woke up because then he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
28 
 
would stop, and he would fall asleep because 
he dr ank all the time . And then he would 
say, I would wake up and I says, ﬁReady to go? ﬂ
 He says, ﬁThat.ﬂ I said, ﬁ We did that in 
the mi ddle of the night? ﬂ He says, ﬁYou woul
dn't have dared to do it during the day.ﬂ It 
was physically one of the most dangerous
 mountain climbing things that you can 
imagine, besides even if it was August there 
were patches of ice, and you don't realize it 
in the mountain, you're seeing sort of a, seei
ng some  snow and you think ﬁOh, well, that's  
just snow, that's a patch of ice,ﬂ which in th
e mountain looks like if it's a yard and it's 10 
yards and you slide down. And once you slide, you go. So there was a dangerous--it wa s 
dangerous for two reasons: number one, it was th
e most i mpractical thing; that's why he 
picked it and he knew his way, he was a pr
ofessional smuggler. The second thing is you 
were in open; at night it 
was too dangerous physically, 
you could kill yourself, and 
people killed themselves. Secondly, during 
the day, you were exposed to anybody who 
saw you--shooting, you know, and the Germans were
 patrolling. It was a terrible thing to 
do. I went back there, 1990, to look at the othe
r side. I couldn't  believe it. It's the mos t  
awe-inspiring mountains that you can dream of
. It's north of Honduras. It's a terrible 
place. 
 

02:55:00  

 

 

Q:  Did the training that they
 were giving you in Toulouse-- 
 

A:  Yeah,terrible. 

 

Q:  --help you at all? 

 
A:  Oh, yeah, because I don't think I could have
 done it and also the fact that I lived in 
the mountains of Grenoble and my job was to go all the time in the mountains. I was 
away some times for two days in a row just
 climbing mountains and looking for things. 
That was also good training, and I mu st say in
 Grenoble, too. I for
got to tell you, Toto 
had organized a gymnas i um there wh
ere we would get training, too. 
 

Q:  Where you were crossin
g, did you think you'd make it? 
 

A:  No. Once we started, no. After the first 
day I said, ﬁI won't ma ke it, definitely 
not.ﬂ But we had no choice. You remember when you don't have a choice?  When you 

don't have a choice, you can do it. I was with
 my  brother, who is 15 years younger, in 

1990, he says, ﬁI cannot believe 
you did that,ﬂ because even on the side, on the Spanish 
side, where it looks much less forbidding, it 
looks horrible. On the Spanish side. And 
once we were on the Spanish side, we  just we
nt down. It was all the way down and it was 
fine, but the French side, in the beginning wh
ere we started these villages, where we saw 
the German patrols, I mean we saw the Germans and when that crazy guy who was drunk 

all the time , he had a big bottle of--he had tw
o bottles, one we brought, because they told 
us, in the mountains again--the French have
 this thing that if 
you don't have calories, 
drink alcohol, it gives you calories. So here 
we had sugar and they said take a bottle of 
wine because when you feel cold in the m
ountains. So Bertrand took it from us and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
29 
 
had one himself, and he just kept on dr
inking. But obviously he 
knew his job. And he 
walked at a terribl e pace and for example when
 I started seeing those villages that we 
crossed and that 11 people--no there were 12 
and the passer--we had to go every time  to 
those villages, yes. Those villages that we
re--I thought we couldn't make it because we'r e 
going to get caught. Then, where we passed t
hose villages and I started, he started 
showing us that we have to go in this open 
thing and I said, ﬁBut we'r e targets,ﬂ and he 
says, ﬁThat's the way to do it. Ah,ﬂ he says
, ﬁIt's too, so dangerous, the Germans don't  
venture here,ﬂ which he proba
bly was right. Then where they
 abandoned us, and I started 
realizing, when he said, ﬁYou know, you see ther
e's a round lake and there's a long lake.  
 

02:58:00 

 

 Once you are out to the long lake, you are in 
Spain.ﬂ And I realized that this is--you can 
see it, but before that you have to climb 
down and up and down and up and that these are 
some , some  absolutely impossible pl
aces to climb up, you know?  You go down and 
suddenly you see that you're over a 300-400 f
eet drop and that the only thing that you 
have is a little path 
going along this thing, a
nd then one of my boyslost his glasses, you 
know, in a bush and so I had to give him my 
glasses and I'm- -then I became  near-sighted 
you know. I'm not--he was terrible, he was blind li
ke a bat, and so I had to give him my 
glasses, so you understand. It was a horribl
e thing. I was sure we wouldn't ma ke it.

03:01:00 

 

 

Q:  Okay, so you ma de it into Spain.  

 

A:  Yeah, we made it into Spain. It was th
e--now, you asked me  about the sixth that I 
recruited, the one from Megève
 was apparently from Belgium. I don't reme mber his name  
because he also--I blocked the ones that gave
 me  trouble. He was from Br ussels and wa s 
supposed to be in the Betar
30
--which was a Revisionist thing, you know, the Jabotinsky
31
 
group--and he, oh, he was a way back. He was bi
g Zionist, you see, but he was sort of 

very volatile and never listen
ed to anybody. The two, Nick and 
Charles, they were from 
Paris. They claime d to be Zionists, but Ch
arles was very subdued. He was just--I think 
they wanted to get out, and so--because they
 never joined the army. The brothers Levine, 
Ira and Simon, they were true Zi onists because
 I think they were from Bel gium and fr om 
Brussels and they really wanted to join th
e army, so they were just regular guys. And 
when we came to Palestine, they joined th
e army, too. So I think Nick, Nick--he was no 

good. The other one also joined the army as a 
ma tter of fact, so they were real. They 
weren't the biggest, they were
n't my kind of guys. I would ha
ve wanted to have George 
and Ado, you know, who were really hot stuff, but they didn't go. And then the 

Frenchme n, I didn't know, and--except I had a lo
t of respect for the 
law student because 
he seemed to be the real stuff, and I had an 
impression that the farmer was the real stuff.  
 

03:03:00 

 

 I didn't like the barber at all, I think he wa
s a pimp who just was trying to get out, and I 
don't re me mber the other two. They were just
, probably just very dull figures and, you 
know you had, you're so concentrated on wh
at you were doing in the mountains and 
trying to stay alive every single se cond, and I 
was more--I was not afraid. I sure was sure 
we won't ma ke it, but again if
 you ask me  if I was afraid, 
no, but I was very, very, very 
concerned that, because of me, all the others
 are going to get it, 
too. That was my only 
concern.  
 

Q:  Didn't you have to trust the 
people you were traveling with? 
 

A:  Yeah, well I trusted--I had no concer
n about not trusting them, no. No, I trusted 
them compl etely. I was very disappointed in
 the one that I thought 
was the nicest, Nick, 
who, as we got in the trench, started holding me
 responsible for not having cigarettes, for 
example, and I mean he was a pain. I was a littl
e disappointed also in 
the fact that, what's  
his name , the other one from Megève was not
 very disciplined. I think he should be

more--he was a Jabotinsky fellow, you know. He
 should be very disciplined and poor 
Ar ma nd, he had to get out, he had no idea. 
Armand was the one I got 
in Toulouse, he was 
from Antwe r p, and he just want
ed to get out, no motivation. 
 
Q:  So, what happened, there you were in Spanish territory? 

 

A:  In Spain, yeah. Suddenly, suddenly--after
 we got all this ordeal, we were so 
exhausted, at one point we 
got to sort of the top 
of a mountain--about where 
mountaineers communicate, and suddenly we 
looked down. First of 
all we found shreds 
of identity pa pers, and so we ma de a big mi
stake--we shredded our ID papers, too. We 

said, ﬁNow we don't need any more French 
papers,ﬂ and then I decided I'm going to 
explore, and I went down because I saw some
 pe rson. We  we re so exhausted. We  had no 

more--we hadn't eaten for four days. I went 
down and I saw a guy and I speak to him and 
I said, ﬁWhere are we here? ﬂ  and he says
 he doesn't  understand, can I speak Spanish. 
ﬁOh,ﬂ I says, ﬁso we'r e in Spain.ﬂ I said, ﬁIs 
this Spain? ﬂ ﬁOh, sure, España.ﬂ And so I 
went to--we went all down. We  
went to the fi rst village which is called Al os, which is 
now a ghost village, Alos. 
 

Q:  [Interviewer speaking about techni cal difficulties]  

 

A:  Who's doing this?  Sorry. 

 [Technicaldi ffi culties] 

 

A:  And then I went down and I asked the guy where we--I couldn't care less, we 
were so desperate. We  hadn't eaten for four 
days, except for the sugar that we still had 
and I was rationing it and then I saw this farmer
. It was a shepherd. He said he couldn't  
speak French so I said, ﬁWe must be in Spain,ﬂ
 so that--I said we were right, those ID's 
meant we were at the border and then we 
went down and I went to the--and again Nick 
drove me  crazy--he says, ﬁThere are bananas he
re, I need to eat. You're responsible for 
us.ﬂ And so I went to the ma rket here, th
ere was a little place cal
led Alos--tiny, little--
now it's a ghost village. I went back there. 
And there was a little place there and there 
happened to be a little market, and I we
nt there and I said to the woma n, ﬁThose 
bananas,ﬂ and she looked at me , s miled and she said, ﬁWait a mi nute.ﬂ She went in the 

back and called the police, and I never 
knew why. I didn't understand why, because you 
know, they'd given me  instructions--I have 
to bring these people within 48 hours to 
Barcelona, and there's a guy by the name  of Stei
nhorn and he's  going to be our agent. It's  
ridiculous because you couldn't get there in
 48 hours, you get caught by the police. The 
reason why, apparently in Spain, in that ar
ea of Spain, bananas are called ﬁplátanos,ﬂ
32
 
and I said ﬁbananas,ﬂ she knew I was a French illegal, and see, I was considered French 

then. And so some  guardia civil,
33
 you know, the Napoleon guy with an old musket that 
must have been from the  1870 war, he says ﬁAlto!ﬂ
 and then he put us in a little, local jail 
and there they kept us for another day without feeding because everybody wanted us to 

sell, to give our watches, 
etcetera, against food. Those guys
 were nobodies, they wouldn't  
do it--they hadn't seen a windfall like that, 
11 people. Nobody has crossed the border for

a long time . Then they took us finally to a pl
ace called Sort, put us 
in another jail there 
for two days, then they took us to Lérida, wher
e they jailed us in a place called Semi nario 
Viejo,
34
 which says the ﬁOld Se mi nary,ﬂ and th
ere we stayed for a couple of weeks and 
they shaved us and now it's not terrible, but
 believe me  when you're 19 years and they 
shaved your beautiful hair, I 
had a lot of it the
n, you feel terrible
, especially everybody 
can see you're a convict. And then they fina
lly shipped us over to 
Barcelona--oh--first 
they put us in a camp called Miranda and 
then they shipped us to Barcelona. 
 
Q:  How long were you in Miranda? 

 

03:08:00  

 

 

A:  Not very long, that was only four days, because-- 

 

Q:  What was that like? 

 

A:  It was just--that was funny because, th
at was funny because they had us divided 
in--everybody's Canadian, see everybody was Canadian, Canadian-Belgian, see, because 

the governme nt of Spain, Franco, had ma de
 an arrangeme nt that he's not going to 
repatriate anybody who is army age and is Ca nadian, so everybody is saying--we all said 

we were Canadians, and so they knew bette
r and so they said, ﬁYes? Canadian? Born 
where? ﬂ And then you know, there were Be
lgian-Canadian, Polish-Canadian, Czech-
Canadian, but I didn't stay there very long. They
 decided to ship me  to Barcelona because 
I was French-Canadian. I didn't say at that 
time that I was Belgian, okay?  I was Belgian, 
but I certainly wasn't  going to say that I wa
s, how do you call it, no nationality at that 
time. And s o I went to--they had given me
 an address to see a guy by the name  of 
Sequéra, who is the head of 
the Joint in Barcelona. He's a Portuguese guy, a Jew. And we 
woke him up and he didn't  want to--it was on a Sunday--he didn't want to come  to see us 

and then I said, ﬁYou have to,ﬂ and then he
 said--and then I gave him a password, which 
was the name of a person. I didn't even know 
what it was--a name
 of a person who was 
apparently a very important person in Swit
zerland--Jeff Roytma n. It 's  a Frenchma n, but 
as soon as I said ﬁRoytma nﬂ he opened the door
 and then he found out 
that we weren't--I 
said I was Fr ench. ﬁCan't  take care of you.ﬂ
 The only people who he could take were 

stateless people, so I should have said, ﬁN
o, I'm s t ateless.ﬂ ﬁNo, you have to go to the 
French.ﬂ The French wanted to take me  ri
ght away and send me  to Morocco, but then I 
didn't want to go, no, to Algiers, because 
at that time  the French government had 
appointed a general, Giraud,
35
 who was a turncoat--only two 
weeks before he was being a 
Fascist, so I said, ﬁOh, no. I just reme mbered
 I'm born in Belgium, I 'm Belgian,ﬂ so they 
shipped me  over to Madrid.

Q:  What was the--how did you ge
t fr om the Semi nary to Barcel ona? 
 

A:  Because they bused me .  

 

Q:  But all of a sudden the Spanish au
thorities released you to the Joint? 
 

A:  Yeah, because--there mu st be interven
tion--because at one time I was released 
even in Lérida for a little while, because I 
think the various emba
ssies and I think the 
French embassy got us out. I don't know how 
be cause one day I found 
myself in a hotel 
in Lérida. We didn't ask any questions. We  we
re so happy because, you see, in--that was 
terrible, there in the Semi nario Viejo. You 
couldn't get close to the window because they 
would shoot you, you know. They were sitting th
ere, the guards, and they were playing 
around as your shadow came , okay, I'm going to shoot, because they would get 50 

pesetas or some thing if they could shoot th
e pr isoner. And so we--we™re sitting in this 
filthy place. You couldn't get 
close to the window and it was 
hot like hell--that me ans it 
was I don't know, August, September. Clearly, 
it was very hot. Then one day we were 
released to a hotel and we  stayed there. Th
en one day they shipped us over to Miranda 
and then four days later they called us up a
nd they shipped us to Barcelona and I didn't 
know why. Then I went to the French, to the 
French Consulate. They were very happy. 
They were going to register, and then I sai
d, ﬁWhere are you going to 
send us?  I want to 
go to England.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, no, no.ﬂ We 'r e goingto Algiers. I said, ﬁB
ut this is Giraud. 
I want to go with de Gaulle.ﬂ ﬁNo, you can't .ﬂ 
I said, ﬁBut he only last week was still a 
Fascist, he still was helping them round up the 
Jews.ﬂ He says, ﬁWell, now he's with us.ﬂ 
So I said, ﬁMy me mory just came  back, I'
m born in Belgium.ﬂ ﬁOh, now we can't take 
you,ﬂ so they sent me  to--ﬂSay, oh, you can jo
in the Foreign Legion.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, not for 
me ,ﬂ so I we nt to Madrid, and I arrived in 
Madrid, and I went to the embassy. I said, ﬁI 
am Belgian.ﬂ He said, ﬁWhat's your name ? ﬂ  
ﬁEinhorn.ﬂ ﬁYou got papers? ﬂ  I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ 
ﬁOh, then we can't . Then you have to go to stateless, but since 
it's the weekend, we'll 
keep you here over the weekend,ﬂ
 and then I me t all my othe
r Belgian buddies and they 
said, ﬁWhy didn't they take you? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI 
don't know, I'm born in Antwerp.ﬂ I said, ﬁI 
speak French and Flemish, as you can see.ﬂ On
e of them didn't  even speak French. He 
says--so one of them says, ﬁBy the way, are 
you Jewish? ﬂ  I says, ﬁYes.ﬂ He says, ﬁThat's 
why. They are basically fighting the same  on th
e side of the English, but they'r e just as 

antisemitic as the Germans.ﬂ And so I said, ﬁFine, if they don't want me, I'll manageﬂ and 

so I went to the stateless, stayed there a littl
e while until there were and then tried to get 
to Portugal, we got caught and came back to 
Madrid and from Madrid
 then I heard about 
that boat that went from Cádiz to, Portuguese 
boat. And there were ot
her refugees and so 
I went. 
 

Q:  But you were staying in Madrid
 with a number of other refugees? 

 

A:  Yeah, there were lots of them, but they
 had been there a long time. They had been 
there a long time. You see, what happened 
is--that's  why everybody was so suspicious 
about me , because for a long time, people had not ma naged to get to Spain. The people 

who were in Madrid, there was a large colony 
of Jewish people who had been there since 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
34 
 
'41 or '40, you know, when it was still--before 
the Americans got into the war, there was 
some  kind of a pipeline, but af
ter--definitely after '42, once 
the Germans had occupied the 
whole thing, nobody had passed, so I was a 
newcomer and everybody was so eager to 
know everything. But at the same  time they w
ondered if I wasn't  being a spy. And that's  
what happened again when I got finally to Ha
ifa. For three months I couldn't join the 
army until they cleared me . And then when the CID cleared me , I could join the ar my . 
 

Q:  So you found out about
 the boat from Cádiz? 
 

A:  Yeah, it's called the 
Nyassa
. 
 

Q:  And where was it headed? 

 

03:15:00 

 

 

A:  To Lorenço Marques, in Mozambique. 
Lorenço Marques. But it stopped in Port 
Said and then it stopped in Haifa 
and so we disembarked in Haifa. 
 

Q:  Was there any problem in getting on the boat? 

 

A:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The Joint Distri
bution over there, w
ith the American 
Friends and Joint Distribution, the Quakers and 
the Joint were working together and they 
were trying to get refugees out of there, so 
they heard about the boat. I didn't hear about 
the boat. They asked the people who wanted to 
go and I was, well, of course I want to go. 
As a ma tter of fact they asked us if we want
ed to go to Port Said or Haifa or Lorenço 
Marques. Some  people chose Lorenço Marques. 
 

Q:  Tell me  about your arrival in Palestine. 

 

A:  Well, for me , it was an emotional thi
ng. I saw it and I--that's what I wanted, and 
they put us in a camp called ‚Atlit. ‚Atlit, 
which is now, I think a prisoner camp for the 
Arabs or some thing, but ‚Atlit was just a cam
p, it was--and there people were trying to 
either ma ke you join the army or go to a kibbut z or free and then a lot of family ca me . I 

had fa mily but they for some  reason didn't come
, and then I finally got--after a few weeks 

got liberated from there. I was one of the la
st ones, because appare
ntly, I found out, I was 
investigated and then I left and went to see 
the relatives I had, stayed a few, went to a 

kibbutz for a little while, then when I was r
eady for it when I me t with Eliahu Golub and 
he told me , ﬁYou should join the army, we want people trained for later on for the 

Haganah.ﬂ

35 
 
A:  It was, if you didn't have the emotiona
l attachme nt, it wasn't  very attractive then. 
It was--Tel Aviv was two ma jor streets. 
Everybody said, ﬁDoesn't
 it look like a little 
Paris? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo it doesn'
t,ﬂ you know. There's a lot of sand. People would show you a 
little tree  that  was that  big, ﬁSee, this is 
a tree.ﬂ And I said ﬁYes, but I came from a 
country with trees.ﬂ You know, it was--you ha
d a feeling that some thing, the Kibbutzim 
were very interesting. But in th
e cities I felt that they weren't 
that motivated at that time. 
There was a lot of, there wasn't
 much work; people were strugg
ling a lot. It  was really a 
struggling country. I'm very glad I saw it then, 
because they used to tell me compared to 
what it was, it's great and I can tell you, compar
ed to what it was then, that country now 
is an absolute ma rvel. I don't understand, I th
ink the Jews were wr
ong; they should have 
waited another five or 10 years and nobody 
would have wanted this country, you know?  
The Arabs was leaving, there was virtually nothing there for the Arabs. The Arabs were 

mi serable. The British didn't let the Jews he
lp the Arabs and they were selling dirt, I 
mean, rocks for nothing, for huge amounts. The people who owned that land weren't 

those poor Arabs, those were 
the rich ones sitting in L
ondon, in Switzerland, the big guys 
who were selling the land for, there was not
hing there. I tell you now, when you see how 
nice and fertile, what they ma de of that count
ry, it was--the only thing is, Galil was nice, 
it was green, but most of the country was 
just rocky, sandy. It wa
s people struggling. 
 

03:20:00 

 

 

Q:  What about the energy of the people? 

 

A:  They were very--they had to be ener
getic; there were no choice. That was a tough 
country, you know, the sands. I worked inkibbutz. I mean--and these guys were such 
idealistic people. Then it was, now they are 
di fferent because they'r e a norma l country.  
 
Q:  How did you relate to it? 

 

A:  Well, I had trouble with the language. You see, I knew--I was from a religious 
fa mily, but I only knew the bi
blical Hebrew, you know. I t
hought the people were very 
nice, the young--you reme mber I was young then. It's not--when you're older you don't  

ma ke rapport, as a young person, I ma de rapport, 
but I didn't stay very long as a civilian. 
I went to the army and in the army it was a 
very, it was different people, some  of the m 

were there because they couldn't ma ke it in 
civi lian life, you know, and others were there 

because they believe d in it and ot hers were 
there to become --because the Haganah told 
them to go and they go in the army. And I had two good friends with whom I still have 

relations at this time. They were really 
motivated guys and one is still a farmer in 
Nahalal.  
 

Q:  So you decided to join up? 

 

A:  I joined. We ll, that's because that'swhat I did. That's what I left the underground 
for, it was my aim then. I had--I'm now in America, but my thing was, ﬁNever agai n.ﬂ  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
36 
 
03:21:00 
 

 I had seen people and I reme mber. I was s
ubjected where the--I was in the subway--once 
was in the occupied zone and it said the Jews
 can only be in the last wagon of the train. 
Here I saw these other people with the yellow 
star. I wasn't  wearing one, but I've seen 
them. You know that's not... I don't think that 
in the last 50 years black people have been 
discrimi nated, in this country, as much as 
the Jews have been discrimi nated. I'm not 
talking about when they were slaves, but th
e discrimi nation against the Jews was awful 
and I didn't want to have this and I said, ﬁNev
er again.ﬂ I was the first one in my fa mily 
that said, ﬁNever again.ﬂ It just  turned 
out for professional reas
ons, finally, I didn't go 
back to Palestine, but my 
sisters did and my brother. 
 

Q:  Okay, so tell me  about
 the early experiences. 
 

A:  Early was a regular--the army experi
ence was we were not treated very well by 
the British because we were Palestinians.  
 

03:22:00 

 

 They prevented--there was an infantry group 
that they some times--fir
st the early part of 
the war, before I was there, there wa s some
 real combat troops that got prisoners in 
Greece and everybody fought in Greece and in Tr i
poli, etcetera. Then they decided- -well-
-became very concerned about us because the Ha
ganah. And so they assigned the infantry 
mostly to guard duties in the 
desert, etcetera. Then most of
 us found out about it, so we 
all joined--most of us--the 
Royal Army Service Corps, which were the truck drivers, 
because they were really suspicious about these, so they shipped them to Egypt and Italy, 
so I was--I, by accident , got into the Royal 
Army  Medical Corps and I was only a high 
school graduate, but when I enlisted it seems that the colonel, the recruiting colonel, 
knew that Montpellier, where I ha d my baccal
aureate, had the oldest medical school. I 
wasn't  allowed to even join it. So he put me
 in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and I was 
then shipped to Cairo. I wanted to be a combat
 soldier so I asked for my transfer to the 
infantry, which they did, and they thought I 
was crazy, so they retrained me  again as a 
combat guy and then they shipped me finally to Italy as a driver. I had 
to learn to drive in 
Italy on the fields, the mi ne fi
elds. I had to learn how to dr
ive trucks. And that was my 
experience. So we move d from the south of It
aly up to the north; we were combat troops. 
 

Q:  All Jewish troops? 

 

A:  All Jewish. And then while I was there,  in Italy, the Jewish brigade was formed, 
and so I asked my transfer from where--fro
m my  company to the Jewish brigade, which 
they gave me , and I became part of the Jewi
sh brigade, and I was in the 178 company, 
which I was very happy, because our comp
any was the major company who smuggle d 
kids out of the camps and illegally brought 
them to Israel and that's why we were 
disbanded. And I suppose yeah, we were disban
ded because of that, because they caught 
a ship that wa s filled with--by--our troops. We  were the famo us 178 and 179 company 

who did the ma rvelous job, including the truck 
drivers, and so illegally we went into 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
37 
 
Austria, etcetera, where they had just  the 
displaced persons and 
ma ny of our soldiers 
remained. Not me because I was not the Sabra
37
, you know, but they left many of our 
soldiers in Germany, brought out the illeg
al ones and under the name of--for this 
discharged soldier. They entered Palestine a
nd then the papers came back and all the time  
like this. They also did a ma rvelous job, our company, in smuggling and, yeah they we re 
disbanding troops and they were--they used to
 have--driving the trucks with weapons into 
the camps to discard them and drove out unt
il they got caught in France and Bordeaux. 

One day, they did this stupid thing, they did 
this in the mi ddle of an election day and 
suddenly they saw trucks and trucks of Je
wish trucks, with the star, going through 
Bordeaux and they got caught. That's  why we got disbanded. 
 

Q:  What were your responsibilities in 
the Jewish brigade?  Where were they? 
 

03:26:00 

 

 

A:  We were just --a pr ivate. I was a privat
e. I was trained and then I became  a Royal 
Ar my me dical orderly in the me dical corps 
and I was assigned to a hospital, a field 
hospital in Egypt, and then I was retrained agai
n to the infantry and then I was sent to 

Italy and I wa s just--I was just driving peopl
e, transport, yeah. We  went through mi ne 
fields, etcetera. I mean, I saw people blow up 
behind me  and in front of me, but I wasn't  

fighting with a rifle. I had a rifl
e, I had actually a tommy gun, but-- 
 

Q:  This was as part of the 
Jewish brigade or before you-- 
 

A:  Both. 
 
Q:  Both? 

 

A:  Yeah, because before the Jewish brigade, I was just a regular army--I mean I was 
an enlisted ma n. I did wh
at they told me  to do. 
 

Q:  Was there an exciteme nt about being part of this? 

 

A:  Yes, very much so. Yeah, that was--I
 mean I applied it. I still have my--I didn't 
bring it--but I have my applica
tion. As a ma tter of fact I, they
 subjected me  to psychiatric 
examination because they said, ﬁYou are inthe most privileged corps in the British 

army.ﬂ I had such a low number, you know. 
Everybody has six numbers but there was so 
few foreign people in the me dical corps, they
 thought I was crazy. 
People would give an 
arm to be in the medical corps and there I am in the medical corps and I ask to be 

transferred back to the Jewish, to the infant
ry. I said, ﬁI came  to fight here.ﬂ And I 
reme mber I went to see a Major Griffith. Ma
jor Griffith, he was 
a typical you know, tall, 
handsome, not too bright, you know, that's what 
they said, typical of the Br itish officer. 
And I went to see him, I said, ﬁI'm he re in holding camp and I came here to fight.ﬂ He

says, ﬁThere's nothing I can do about you,ﬂ and two weeks later I was shipped out to 
Italy. But I mean, you were, I was young, I had come
 to join the army, not as one of the 
guys for the--because you couldn't find a job or some thing. As a ma tter of fact I was, in 

the three weeks that I, three months that I was 
a civilian in Israel, I 
first was in a ki bbutz, 
but later on I was even a diamond polisher fo
r two and a half mont
hs because everybody 
was convinced being born in Antwerp, I must 
know how to polish diamonds. I had a job. 
 

Q:  While the wa r was on, you were primarily in Italy? 

 

A:  Egypt and Italy. 

 

Q:  Egypt and Italy? 

 

A:  Yeah. Also in Palestine because I was in
 Serafand. I was trained in Serafand, then 
I went to Egypt, then I was retrained in Sera
fand, then I went to Egypt again, and then I 
went to Italy and then as the war finish
ed, we mo ved up to Belgium, Holland, France. 
 

Q:  Where were you when the wa
r finished?  What was happening? 
 

A:  The war finished, I was in Tarvisio, n
ear the Yugoslav-Austrian border. We were 
ended and we walked there. We  used to go to Austria, Klagenfurt--that's  when nobody 

ever had been a Nazi, nobody ever, they didn'
t even know what you were talking about if 
you asked them for the Nazi. All 64 m
illion Germans were amongst the 65,000 anti-
Nazi's, all 64 million of them. And t hen we--but 
they didn't let us be at all long there, they 
moved us immediately up to Belgium because th
ey didn't want to have  the Jewish troops 

in Germany. We went straight to Belgium, stayed in Belgium for a little while, Leuven, 
and then Antwerp, and from Antwerp we 
went to Breda. From Breda went to 
Scheveningen and from Scheveningen went to 
Calais and then they caught our company 
in smuggling these things so they disbanded us
 and sent us to Qassa
sin, in Egypt, at the 
border near Suez, and then they kept us 
there for about six weeks to two months. 
 

Q:  When was this? 

 

A:  Probably at '46, I think. It was just 
a year after the war,
 you know, because we 
were--I was in occupa
tion for a year, yeah. 
 

Q:  Where were you as the wa r was finishing? 

 

A:  That's  what I said, Tarvisio. 

 

Q:  You were in Tarvisio? 

 

A:  Yeah. 

 

Q:  Were you fighting? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
39 
 
A:  No, we were--yeah--we were driving. Ye
s, we were fighting, I me an, they had 
very few fighting jobs actually, the Jewis
h. I had two of my friends got wounded; we 
were on patrol some time s . Yeah, but I was 
in the, you know, in the army--only a very 
small numb er of people actually on the front
 line. I was on the front line. I was a 
combatant, but not in, within the transport service.  
 
Q:  How did you learn the war was over? 

 

A:  Oh, we learned the war was over. We
 were there, we were--somebody came and 
said the war is over, I me an we expected it
 any time. I mean, an 
officer, I think Captain 
Gileladi, came  in and says, ﬁThe war is 
over,ﬂ and we got drunk. Did I get drunk! And I 
hadn't, since I was the youngest one in my 
compa ny. They put me  on guard duty. I didn't  
know where my rifle was I was so drunk. 
 

Q:  And the people in this community didn'
t know Nazis, I mean, 
basically, after the 
war? 
 

A:  Tarvisio, the Italians, no Italian, you 
know. We  r e spected the Italians because 
ma ny of the Italians had helped the Jews. Oh, 
we  were very fond of the Italians and we 
were in Italy and the Italians were really 
not racist, there was a 
small group that has done 
a lot of harm, just like in Holland, you know
. A lot of people in Holland died, but it 
wasn't  because of the people, there we re quite a fe w, you know Holland wasn't  all that 

kosher about the Jews, but in Holland a lot 
of Jews, disproportionate amount of Jews, 
were deported. In Italy, also this problem becau
se there weren't that ma ny Jews in Italy 
and a lot of them were deported and di ed, but 
that was because at that Graziani, that, you 
know, after Mussolini's, Mussolin
i's downfall, you notice a group of die-hard Fascists 
that suddenly applied very much the rules 
and that's where in Italy. But most of the 
Italians we fe lt had helped the Jews and so
 the population, we believed them when they 
said they weren't Fascists, but we didn't  believe the Austrians. 
 

Q:  What did you do about it? 

 

A:  Nothing.Absolutely. 

 

Q:  When you were in all of these places-- 

 

A:  Oh, were we watched, they never let 
us out, I mean, even the week that we 
traversed Germany, we were just kept in
 our camps you know, we knew they wouldn't. 
 

03:33:00 

 

 

Q:  So in this year after the war, nine
 months after the war, where you were moved 
around?  Wh at were you doing? 
 

A:  I was a soldier. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306

Q:  I know, but the war was over. 

 

A:  Guard duty. No, we did, a soldier--what 
do the soldiers now do: we trained; we 
transpor t things; we have guard duty, ju
st like--and in the military, you know, people 
think that military's spend their lives fighting, ev
en in the America, even in Desert Stor m, 
ma ybe 10 pe rcent of the people are actually
 joined the fighting. The support group is, 
even in the underground--the combatant were 
only a small group. See, when I was in the 
underground, my ma jor thing was liaison, 
smuggling, providing false papers--even 
occasionally bringing over some weapons that
 they had, some  poor old rusty weapons or 
some thing, which I used to carry in the 
violin case, you know. The army was not in 
tremendous experience, nothing to it. I just want
ed to join and I woul
d have liked to be 
fighting, but very small numbers did. 
 

Q:  So after you were disbanded, what
 were your plans?  Where did you go? 
 

A:  I went imme diately back
 to France to study me dicine. 
 

Q:  Did you go to find your family? 

 

A:  Oh, my fa mily. I had found my fa mi l y. O
h, I'm sorry. See, my fa mily, after I left, 
there was an agreement that my sisters w
ould join the undergroundand that if things 
were too rough so that they couldn't continue 
to care for my family, they would be helped 
to go to Switzerland. So my parents and my
 two younger siblings, one was about five, 
yeah, and the other one was 10 or 11, they 
were smuggled over to Switzerland, where 
they were interned. You know 
it now, but those Swiss weren't 
all that right. The Swiss 
have turned back ma ny, ma ny Jews, more than
 the Spanish, and fortunately my brother 
was little because you had to have a child with
 you who was less than five years or four 
years, or you would turn back 
to the Germans. And I had my, 
if you ever saw that picture, 
"The Boat is Full" or some thing like this, 
horrible what the Swiss did. But anyhow they 
were in Switzerland. My sisters,
 after the war, mo ved back to
 Paris. When I--but  we had 
a good arrangements for years, I wrote to my
--when I was in Spain 
even, I corresponded 
with them in France through the General Post Offices. We  had this arrangement always 

to write to each other through General Post 
Office, so I knew what was happening to my 
sisters and then I knew that my parents we
re in Switzerland because they communicated 

with thei r brother in Palestine, they had a br
othe r in Palestine. So I knew that they were 

in Switzerland and then I knew what--my sister
s could write to Switzerland. Even from 
the underground, you could write.  
 

03:36:00 

 

 And so I knew where they were and then I f
ound my fa mily. At first 
I found my sister in 
Paris, and then when the war was over, imme
diately my parents moved bac k to Antwerp 
and so I saw my parents, my father first, 
when he joined, when I was with the Jewish 
Brigade in Belgium. So I saw my father and 
then later on I was sta
tioned in Antwerp, and 
my parents were living there, and I helped my
 parents get to Israel and they left. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
41 
 
didn't want to stay in--because my mother 
saw all those dead pe
ople, you know, when she 
walked in the street for her--this street, he
r brother, who was no longer there, her sister, 
her brother-in-law, her nephew, I me an, she 
only saw ghosts and she had a lot of people 
of her fa mily that were killed so she didn'
t want to stay and my
 sisters, who had done 
such a beautiful job in the Je
wish army, had become  very Zi
onistic and so they went to 
Israel and they stayed there. 
 
Q:  It must have been wonderf
ul to see your parents again. 
 

A:  I can tell you, that was some thing. And 
my brother who was so little had become  
a fair eight, nine year old. It's  been good, the 
feeling that this fa mily was totally intact. 
That was the--because none of the families who had stayed had been intact. I mean, one 

of my aunts, Dora, and her husband and two 
of her children, one never came  back, one 
came back from Buchenwald, but he was very disturbed. One was in Buchenwald and 

one never came back. And the second one never came , my brother, the brother of my 

mother, never came back and the older sist er 
plus her daughter never came  back, so that, 
for my mother, we all used to live within 
two or four blocks of each other and the only 
ones that were saved are the one
s had a brother, for some  reason one of the brothers of 
my mother, he was a Mexican. I don't know fo
r some reason he was 
Mexican, but he was 
Mexican, so he got out of the country with 
all his four sons. And the second one, she 
ma naged, also before, as soon as the war was 
over, she was gone. Oh, that's the one with-
-the mother of the people in Nevers. So those 
people were saved because they left before 
the war. 
 

Q:  So your feeling is that your fa mily, 
by basically running away, was able to save 
itself. 
 

A:  Not only that, and the fact is that we 
joined the underground a
nd that I still feel 
that we Jews were much too passive. And thos
e who weren't passive, either they died for 
a cause or they didn't die. That's my feeli
ng. That's  why I never feel that appeasement 
works and I still don't understand why, when 
everybody knew they were dying they didn't 
ma ke some t hing like the Jewish ghetto in Wa
rsaw. If you have to die, some body has to 
pay for it. And that's why, I mean, right now
 I get afraid of--occas
iona lly, I get worried 
about things, but then I wasn't , because it wa
sn't because I was a hero. I was not, I was 

just a meek, little fellow, but the thing is, 
I kept on saying, ﬁWe 'r e going to die.ﬂ I was 
sure we were not going to ma ke the war, b
ecause that was the feeling. Things were, you 
know every day you would hear. You had no ne
ws except that Europe wa s shrinking, 
taking Russia out of this thing, you know, 
Russia was disappearing. England was bombed 
for 76 days in a row and you know when you heard the BBC, whenever you used to hear 

the BBC, and then you wouldn't hear. We 're going t
oo, we lost there, we lost Tripoli, we 
lost Benghazi, we lost this, nothing happene
d. You were just going to Toulouse and then 
you had an impression that they were negotia
ting and you had the feeling as a ma tter of 
fact, you had a feeling it can't  happen. It can't , we
 are going to be lost and I didn't join the 

underground because I thought that we would 
liberate. I thought I joined the underground 
ma inly because if we going to die, we must be dying fighting. I was convinced, just like I 

was convinced when we went to Spain that we
™re not going to ma ke it,
 but at least I tried. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
42 
 
I'd always this feeling, you have to try a
nd you know I'm a little bit always looking back 
and I said, I don't understand why, when you kne
w you were going to die, you were lined 
up near the stove, near the crematorium, w
hy didn't  you turn around and kill a German? 
You can't  be deader than that. You're going to
 be dead in half an  hour in the oven. That 
was my feeling, and I think when looking back 
those years, I don't think I was a hero or 
anything, I just lived. And I was surely going to 
die and if you're going to die, it's  almost 
like sometimes I feel, somebody asked me wh
at would you do if some body told you in 
six months you are going to die, then I w
ould like to know what I'm going to do for the 
next six months. And I think all this war I ha
d always this feeling, I'm not going to ma ke 
it, nobody's going to ma ke it, no Jew is going to 
ma ke it, but we have to ma ke the m pay 
dearly. 
 
Q:  What do you think about your background and your growing up gave you this 
edge or this conjecture?  That
 it had ma de you feel this way, 
when a lot of people, as you 
said, were more passive? 
 

A:  I don't know, because I, no, I--maybe yeah--when I was in Antwerp, I joined a 
Zionist organization and it was 
not the Betar, but it was an 
organization which felt also, 
don't give an inch. But I don't think that did 
it. I don't know, I have the impression it's that 
feeling that we were a very close family a
nd we  used to discuss those things and my 

father had this attitude, d
on't trust anybody. And he had th
is, he said, like Einstein, 
antisemitism is like a shadow, it follows you ev
erywhere, so you better be prepared and 
when he showed me , you know he always re
peated the notion: ﬁN
o, I'm going to be a 
Belgian and I'll be an equal,ﬂ and when it ca
me  out, we started saying--my father came  
back and smack in his face and he says, 
ﬁYou imagine, a Frenchma n hitting me  and 
calling me  dirty Jew when we are having this fight against the Germans.ﬂ And the same 
thing happened again. I starte
d thinking he was right. And 
then when I start getting 
occupied and we heard about all the shrinki
ng of the free world, said, ﬁWe don't want to 
ma ke it.ﬂ Now, how we going to ma ke them pay?   
 
03:44:00 

 

 That's, I think it was not my upbringing that 
ma de it mostly. I think it's the desperation. 
 

Q:  When you were living in Antwerp origin
ally, you were a fairly religious family. 
During these war years, did you pay any atten
tion to religion or to holidays, or to 
anything like that? 
 

A:  Oh, yes--we didn't--no--during the occupa
tion?  No. As a ma tter 
of fact my father 
allowed us--he didn't eat trayf
38
, he never ate--I mean, he ate meat, but it had to be beef, 
etcetera. He let us eat anyt
hing we wanted, when we coul
d find it. Reme mber, for a long 
time we could just eat whatever we f
ound, some t i me s dandelions on the streets. 
 

Q:  Was religion important to you at 
all during this peri
od, psychologically? 
 
                     
 
38
 Non-Kosher food or drink (Yiddish).  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
43 
 
A:  No, it has never been, too. I'm more re
ligious now than I was. No, I think I was 
rebelling a little bit against 
my father's religion. I was mo
re ethnically identified. I was 
starting to rebel a lot against 
religion. I like much more the tradition. I was very, when I 
heard traditional praying, etcetera. I--it was mo
re like I can go to a 
church now, I love to 
go to cathedrals. My wife  says, ﬁOne day you're going to convert because you love so 
much the cathedrals.ﬂ I like th
e liturgy, etcetera, but I wasn't
 religious then and during the 
war. I went, after the war, through a tremendous
ly anti-religious feeli
ng, because I felt if 
God had permitted that, it isn't possibl e that 
we had the right religion or some thing. And 

until this day I can't  understand what happened, as far as religion is conc erned. 
 

Q:  Did you resent bei
ng a Jew during the war? 

 

A:  No. Never. That's one thing I felt, no, no. As a ma tter of fac t , until--it took me  a 
long time and until that day that I was caught 
by this--and I st ill sa
y I am Jewish--feeling 
now I am re ady. All I had to say was no, and they would have accepted it, because I ha d 

the papers saying Belgian born, etce
tera. They didn't know a ny better. 
 

Q:  Another thing I want to ask you about, a
nd it'll just be a coup
le more mi nut es, if 
you had any impressions of some  of t he unde
rground leaders in Toulouse that you want 

to share? 
 

A:  No, I me t only Pol, and I me t the one 
that later on became a relative of mi ne, 
Jacques. I had the impression that they we
ren't organized well. That gave me  the 
impression that they took chances, and as a ma
tter of fact, I think Jacques, two weeks or 
three weeks after he got my--w
e wanted, we kept--was caught and sent to Buchenwald, 
but I could have said that he would be caught
 because he looked--he wasn't  really acting 
like some body who is relaxed, and I had the impr
ession like when they sent us over to 
Spain, gave me  this thing, 48 hours after you arri
ve there you have to be in Barcelona and 
report to Secera and then you will meet a fellow by the name  of Steinhorn.  
 

03:48:00 

 

 Steinhorn didn't even know he was the agent. And then he gave me  another name  of 
some body--Croustillon--and I reme mber Croust
illon, he didn't . He also didn't know he 
was a liaison and they were both very, very un
impressive people, the ones that I saw. But 
Pol apparently did a nice job, I just didn't 
know hi m. But my i mpression then is probably 
wrong, because they did have a 
good organization, but not when I me t him. See, I was a 
guinea pig, reme mber. They had time to organize
 themselves, to solidify themselves, to 
polarize; but when I was there 
it was a fledgling organization. 
 

Q:  Just trying to get a sense of what ki
nd of people some  of those leaders were--but 
you didn't know them well? 
 

A:  No, he was a, I don't know, he was a very short fellow, a very small fellow, with a 
heavy Polish accent; and Jacques wa s a very 
energetic, very strong, mysterious guy, but 
he acted mysterious so that you could pick 
him up and I was very fond of him. He died 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0306  
44 
 
recently of cancer, but he  became  one of my
 dearest friends. There were some people like 
Maurice J ourdan, Ado, George, they all ha
d it, but I think they were not yet 
organized. 
 
Q:  Anything else you want to add? 

 

A:  No, simply if you want to see ma ybe the thing of this. [displaying photo] 

 

Q:  Yes, we do want to. 

 

A:  This shot here, this was 
the Organisation Juive de Combat. 

 

03:50:00 

 

 

Q:  [Speaking to cameraman] Can we get this? 

 [Technicaldialogue] 

 You know what, we'r e going to have to do th
is--I do want to do this-- do this. I want, 
I do want him to show, I want to ma ke sure 
that he can see them. 
You tell us what they 
are. 
 

A:  That's the certificate of the--thi s is document attesting my activities and 
describing it during the war in the organizati
on. I ma inly show it, show you the name  of 
the organization which is Jewi
sh--Organization of Combat, wh
ich was refe rred to as OJC. 
This is si gned by the--this is not the st
ation, by the commande r--whether you, now you 
can show it--by the comma nder of the Jewi
sh underground and Toulouse captain Loeb 
and countersigned by the command, the French 
command of t he army of t he region. The 
other document, you want to see this one th
at she has asked me  to show you, is my 
discharge from the Jewish Brigade;
 and this here is the paper that I received when I was--

that points out that  I'm an illegal, that  I ha
ve entered illegally Spai
n, and this was a paper 
that was stamped, every singl
e day we have to report to the commander here, see, 
because we were illegals; and th
is was after I was discharged 
from jail, so every week we 
had to go and have this stamped at the comm
ande r; and this here attests that I have 
entered clandestinel
y, clandestinely.  
 

03:51:00 

 

 Itsays,ﬁclandestinamente.ﬂ

 This was the paper, it says, ﬁclandestinely entered Spainﬂ; 
and then finally, here is a certific
ate issued to me  that I had trie
d to register--to register at 
the pre-me dical faculty of sciences in Mont
pellier, but was reject
ed because I did not 
meet the Jewish quota of people admitted to th
e university, for racial reasons. And that's 

about it. Thank you.
