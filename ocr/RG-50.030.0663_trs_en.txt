A: My father owned a fairly large store in 
Ludwig shafen.  Men's and boys' clothing.  We

A: Okay . 

Q: -- friends over? 

A: I have a sister, who is one
 year and two months older th
an I am.  She is still alive, 
thank God.  She lives in California now.  An
d she came to America before I did. I also 
had a little brother who was just about the sa
me amount of time, ab out a year and six 
months younger than I was.  He died before 
he was two years old.  He is buried in a 
cemetery in Ludwigshafen. I re

friends over?  Did they  play 
cards?  What did they do? 
A: My father owned tw o build ings.  We lived 
in one of them.  It 
was an apartment house 
build ing.  There were five floors.  No elev
ator.  We lived on th e second floor.  There was 
a store on the first floor and an apartment.  
And we had a lovely, lovely apartment.  I 
mu st say my father was quite wealthy.  And 
according to my mother, at one time he was

worth a half a million marks.  Not dollars, bu
t marks.  W h atever that means at that 
particular time, it's still
 a lot of money.  Yeah . 
Q: Did you go to school there? 
A: Did I what? 

Q: Did you go to school? 

A: Did I go to school there?  Abso lutely.  I 
went to first the normal -- what they call it, 
the --  

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: 
 Elementary school. 
A: -- elementary school for four years. 
 We were only boys, which was the norm over 
there.  We were approximately 45 young boys. 
 And I stayed there for four years. Now, 
in Germany, if you don't want to go to  high sc
hool, you don't have to
, but you have to go 
eight years for public school.  My father
 and mother thought I should get a better 
education, so at the fifth grade, wh ich woul
d be here, I started my  first year of high 
school.  High school in Germany was six year
s. So when I graduated high school, and I 
must say I was the only Jewish boy in 
the whole town  who graduated high school 

because the other ones were all tak en out of 
the high school before because of Hitler.  But 
I lived on the other side of the track. Not 
only that, I mi ght as well get this straight, 
there's no sense lying about it.  My mo ther was 
a converted Jew.  My father went into th e 
war in 1914, '14 to '18, World War I.  He ha
s a business already.  And my  mo th er was his 
top sales girl and they also fell in love.  When
 he was in the service, she went to the rabbi 
-- and I have the papers home -- and to ok He
brew lessons and co nverted Judaism. Now, 
this I mention because it -- late
r on, it comes out that that ga
ve my father and mother a 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg

tremendous plus because she was in Hitler's 
sight an Aryan no matter what the religion 
was.  Just like the opposite side, if you we
re Jewish and converted to Christianity and 
Hitler came, you were a Jew no matter what.  
So that's w h ere we were. And in high 
school, our high school happened  to be th
e same school that Chan cellor Kohl went to, 
who was the Reich 's chancellor.  My claim to
 fame.  And we were 50 boys.  I was the 
only Jewish boy in the whole high school. 
Q: So did you have
 non-Jewish friends in high school? 
A: Oh, yes.  As a matter of fa
ct, if you want to know the trut
h, in my class we had about 
10 or 11 -- I'm not sure anymore, I think it 
was 10 -- 10 fellows who were like the gang.  
When  I say gang, it's  not like a gang here. We
 did all kinds of st
upid things like, you 
know, if it was a real hot day and we wanted
 to get the afternoon off, we put a fire 
underneath the baskets in the school yard.  
Was made out of metal, you know, so they 
said, "Get home, alright."  And I was one of 
them. I was never called upon to be anything 
different but a student and a buddy.  In my  cl
ass of 50 students, I had no enemy but one, 
if you want to call it an  enemy.  There was on
e fellow in the class, I remember blond hair 
and glasses, he looked like a 
real future priest.  I me an, you know, that holin ess about 
him.  And ev er so often, he would say, "I 
hate you, Eric, I hate you."  I says, "Why do 
you hate me?"   "Because you 
killed my Jesus."   I said, "H
an s, I didn't kill your Jesus.  
That happened thousands of 
years ago." "Your people killed 
my Jesus and you're a Jew, 
so you killed my Jesus." Naturally
, this is all in German.  You want to hear it in German?  
No. 
 [Laughter] 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg

A: And I finally got sick and tired of him and 
I said, "Look, Hans."  
I said, "You want to 
make a fight out of it?  I'll fight you."  I'
m a little guy.  I was only about four -- four -- 
5'2".  I grew up a little more later on.  And he 
says, "No, I don't w ant to fight you, but you 
killed my Jesus.ï¬‚ It came to a point where 
I asked my Hebrew scho
olteacher, who also 
was the cantor of our organi- -- of our temple, 
"What am I going to do with th is kid?"  He 
says, "Well, just tell him Jesus Christ was a 
Jew." I was floored.  I 
was stunned.  I had no 
idea.  And I went to Hebrew school since I was 
six years old.  I says, "Are you su re?"  He 
says, "Absolutely." So the ne
xt time I was told, Eric, I ha
te you because you killed my 
Jesus, I says, "Do you hate all 
the Jews?"  He says, "Yes." 
 I said, "Then you must hate 
Jesus Christ." "What are you saying?" I says, 
"Jesus Christ was a Jew." "You're out of 
your mind."I says, "Go and ask 
your father, your priest or 
anybody you want." That was 
the last time I heard from him.  This was ju
st a little episode that I like to tell because it 
was, to me,  very satisf y ing to find out that Jesus Christ was a Jew.  
Q: Certainly. 
A: I graduated there in 1937.  Hitler came into
 power in '33.  And my other friends -- I 
had a lot of Jewish friends from the temple.  
We used to go to temple in the morning.  
And then in the afternoon, the children woul
d come and we have like a children's service 
which I used to lead quite often. 

Q: How -- was your family observant? 
A: We had a kosher household, 
but we were not orthodox.  
We had milchig and fleishig, 
pieces of cutlery.  And we had for Pesach sp
ecial things.  And milchig and fleishig was 
separate. As a matter o f fact, I always pointed out
 we had an ice box.  At that time there's 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
8 
no refrigeration.  We had a double ice box 
fo r milchig and fleishig.  You understand 
milchig and fleishig, yes?  Thank you. 
Q:   Yes. 
 [Laughter] 

A: Okay .  And used  to put blocks of ice under
neath into , and that kept it cold.  But I don't 
-- it had -- I don't know anybody else that ha
d the comb ination of these two different 
things.  Our -- what shall I say, when -- when
 you -- when you dry the dishes, your hand -
- hand things, blue was for milchig and red was 
for fleish ig.  So, I mean, we kept all this, 

but we were not orth odox. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Let me continue.  The other ch ildren, 
yeah, Jewish children 
-- Ludwigsh afen, my 
home town, was cut in half by th e railroad.
  The railroad was only one block of the 

apartment house where we lived 
in.  The other apartment house that my  father owned had 
16 apartments.  They were smaller apartments
.  And it was also the apartment where the 
ground floor, my father's store was located.  It
 was a big store. Yeah.  The other part of 
the children lived on th e other side. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: My father supplied a factory, which was 
located in my home town, and is called --  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  IG Farben?  
A: A --  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  IG Farben? 

A: No, no, no. 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
9 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  No, BASF?  
A: Yeah, yeah.   
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  BASF.   
A: Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik, BASF.  
Have it here in the United States, all over 
the place.  All right.  Tremendous place.  And 
what they specialized  in was colors, dyes, 
and any kind of liquid medicati
on.  And my  father supplied the uniforms. This factory is 
probably  half the size of my  town of Union 
where I live.  It was like a city.  We -- I was 
once there and they  took us for a 
ride around.  Took us
 four hours.  And 
so he -- he made 
good money. 
Q: Did your fami ly have non-Jewi
sh friends as well in the area? 
A: Those nine kids in th
e gang were all my  friends. 
Q: But did your parent
s have non-Jewish friends?  Family friends? 
A: Not many, no, no, no, no.  
Very few. My father was a very generous man.  We had a 
lot of people coming from Poland, Jewish people
.  And they came to 
my father and they 
said, "Can you give us some of
 your clothes that you sell here
 and give us a little discount 
and then we can go and peddle it and chargelike three or four marks," you know.  And 
my father said, "I'll help you."
  And he did.  And th ey paid
 him slow but sure, but then 
when Hitler came, he lost thou sands and thousands of dollars. 
Q: Do you remember --  
A: But --  
Q: Sorry.  Go ahead. 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
10 
A: Yeah.  While I was the only 
one on my side, there was othe rs in the school before me, 
but not since I went to high school.  Except 
one time my  cousin came 
to live with us for a 
year, so he went to the same school.  But 
otherwise, I was the only Jewish boy. Talking 
about non-Jewish friends, when  we graduated in the high school, we wore for six years 

caps with a brim.  Not like here.  They were
 more like milita
ry caps.  And in the first 
year, they were red.  Red.  And there was 
a band around it and it was red and green an d 
white. In the second year, it was the same  re
d cap, but it was red and blue and white.  
Okay? Third and fourth years, the caps became 
green, also with a change of things.  And 
in the fifth year, it was blue with it. When
 you graduated, for one
 day only you got a 
white cap.  Halleluiah.  We made it.  All right
?  And what you did on that day that you -- 

after you had your white hat, 
you got a cane, you know, like 
a heavier cane like the men 
used to do.  And you wo re your wh ite 
cap and you marched through town.  And I 
marched through town with nine of my  gang fri
ends.  And we came to a, what shall I say, 
like a bar, like a -- well, a dr
ink, drink place, you know. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:
  Pub.  Pub. 
A: A pub, sort of like it, but you could get fo
od th ere too.  And on th
e pub, on the outside, 
it says Juden nicht erwunsch t.  "Jews are not 
wanted here."So th ey said, "Come on, let's 
go.  We're going to drink a little b
it." I was never a drinker.  I says, "I don't want to go in 

there because they don't want 
me." "What do you mean?  This
?"  They ripped it off the 
wall.  "You go on."  So I went. And wh en 
we were chugalugging, you know, somebody 
says, "Eric, come on, you and me."  Well, I 
was -- I was half soused by the time I got out 
of there and I never -- never was a drinker.  
It was ridiculous. So 
then they said, "All 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
11 
right, we'l l go to  a movie now."  We had 
a beautiful big movies house.  UFA, I 
remember.  United -- it wouldn't  be united.  Wh
atever. And they  said, "Okay, we going to 
see the mo vie."  I says, "I can 't go." "Why?  It
 doesn't say anything." 
I said, "I don't have 
money." So this was in 1937. 
 So th ey said, "Okay, okay, so you don't go, it's  okay." I 
says, "At least go there and buy 
some tickets."  So th ey gave me mo ney and th ey said, 
"That 's just  enough for 
all the tick ets.  All right?"  And 
I get up th e money to  go there.  
She gave me ten tickets.  They
 paid for me to go 
with them. This was my gang.  I can 't 
say anything else.  They were all my friends
 to the day that I ca
me back toGermany 
years and years later.  They a
nnounced in the local paper th
at three Jewish people -- one 
was a woman, my self, and another fellow who 
happened to be my  best friend, but he 
lived on the other side of the track.
 And I have to think.  One second. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Wh en yo
u went back, these same -- 
A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
.  It was announced in the pape
r that I was coming.  When we 
landed th ere, we were invited by th e mayor 
of the town.  It's a pretty  big town. 
Q: Now, actually, I want to, if you don't 
mind, hold this story 
until later on because I 
wanted -- I want to hold this st
ory until later in the interview. 
A: Okay . 
Q: Because I want to jump back to 1933. 

A: Okay . 
Q: Just so we can stay in ch
rono- -- in chronological order.  
And I want to hear that later 
on. But do you remember when 
Hitler came to 
power in 1933? 
A: Yes. 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
12 
Q: And what was the mood in  your commu nity at that point in -- 
A: Very happy, because if 
you weren 't happy, you 
could have been d
ead.  I mean, Hitler 
came to power by -- I mean, he started really way before that. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But by th at time, you saw practically ev
ery day the stormtroopers marching thro ugh 
town with the flags an
d with their sabers on their side.  Not sabers exactly, only a -- a 
knife like that.  And we were on one of the main streets in town
, so we saw it all. 

Q: And -- 

A: And, wait, one minute. 
Q: Sure. 
A: And I remember th at -- I think it was in 
1933 that he used, like the chancello r, we had 
at that time a man in power in Germany, was 
an ex-general.  He was still a general, but 
only by name, Hindenburg, von Hindenburg. 
 All right.  Von Hindenburg was mo re or 
less forced to appoin t him, but he had to be
 put into power by the 
people.  And everybody 
knew you better vote for Hitler because if you 
vote against them, they 'll know.  You may 
think you fo ld the paper and pu
t it in, they'l l know.  Well, 
he was elected 99 percent of 
the people. And after that, things slowly bega
n to change.  They started the Hitler Youth, 
all with uniforms and the bars across and very 
nice uniforms.  At the end of my  stay in 
high school, every one of my  student frie
nds, including my  gang friends, were in the 
Hitler Youth.  Didn't  affect anybody, not 
even me. And then th
e girls started coming 
along, wh ich was called BD M.  BD M.  Sta
nds for Bund Deutsche 
Matrone.  Organization 
of German girls. And th en it came around, 
you know, like the edict, the boys and the 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
13 
girls, they can go to camp t
ogether and they  can sleep together because we want to have 
pure Aryan people coming around and having 
children.  And then 
the communists slowly 
but surely were either killed off or sent to  concentration camps. I remember co ming home 
from school and there was a big sign on one of 
the walls.  And it mu st have had about 60 
pictures of dead Nazis, only 
they weren't called Nazis.  
All these people were killed by 
the communists.  It was really -- I mean, you 
looked at this, and if you weren't G erman 
for Hitler, your blood started to
 boil.  You know, the faces were all smashed in and all 
kinds of things. No w, th e concentration camp of Dachau , which is in Bavaria, near 

Munich, at first the only people in there we
re communists and Jews.  Not Jews because 
they were Jewish, but Jews because they we re also communists or against Hitler. In 1937 

when  I graduated high school, Hitler at that
 time was in a position where I knew and my 
father knew and every Jewish person knew th at
 there was going to be a war because you 
had to save everything that had metal.  Like
 toothpaste came in a metal, you know, thing.  
You squeezed it out and you had to put it on th
e side.  Anything that contained metal you 

had to save and you had to turn  it in.  By '37,
 my  mo th er sen t  me to
 the headquarters.  I 
had to tu rn in all the gold and silver we ha
d. By '37, I realized I'd better get out of 
Germany fast.  I was 16 years old.  And what 
am I going to  do?  So I was advised by the 
Jewish people and the offices there to learn 
a trade.  Naturally, I 
was supposed  to take 
over my  father's store, would 
have been a wonderful thing, but that was out.  Already the 
SA men were standing in front 
of the store.  Don't buy from th
e Jew.  Nobody was let in.  
So my  father had to close up. 

Q: When  did that happen, do you reme mb er? 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
14 
A: This was right after I 
graduated.  '37, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And -- I'm trying to follo
w what I was saying here. 
Q: You had to take a -- 
A: Oh, yeah, Hitler, Hitler. 
 When I was -- this -- this is -- th
is is a very cute story.  You 
have to look at it from 
a -- from a comic point.  It wasn 't fu
nny, but you have to look at it. 
My brother was buried in a cemetery in L
udwigshafen.  In the 
regular cemetery, the 
Jewish people had a sp ecial section.  It hada gate.  You could either get a key to go and 

see your beloved one who was bu
ried there or you could ask somebody, the office.  And I 
knew exactly wh ere my brother was buried. An
d my mother -- and in Germany, if you go 
to a cemetery, every grave is a display gard
en.  If you've never seen it, you ju st stand 
there, oh, my God.  Planted -- naturally, it
's -- I'm talking about 
summertime.  Planted 
with the most gorgeous flowers and little bushes 
and everything else.  Pictures of -- of 
beauty, really. And my mother one day -- and 
we used  to go there like once a month or 
every other -- every other week or something.
  And she says, "I bought some flowers 
yesterday."  She says, "Eric, please take it to
 Werner."  My brothe
r was Werner.  "Take it 
to the cemetery and plant them."  I said, "O
kay, Ma." I took my little package with the 
flowers over into the cemetery, I planted th
e flowers and I'm comin g  back.  Now, the 
street that I'm usually taking to coming back
 was full of people.  
Wasn 't there when I 
went down there. I says, "Wha
t's going on?" "Hitler's co ming.
  Hitler's coming." I says, 
"Oh, my  God.  Wh at I am going to  do?  Am I going to run backwards?  Forwards?" I 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg

always -- and even I show you pictures -- always wear leather pants, short leather pants 
with the -- 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Su
spenders?  Susp enders? 
A:   -- suspenders and this 
across with an ed elweiss on here, you know.  I had blue eyes, I 
had blond hair.  I was a typical German boy you
 want to see.  And I'm trying to squeeze 
there -- this was like six deep
, and a motorcade was coming.
 I just stood there and I 
looked around.  Then
 somebody saw me and somebody 
said, "Wait a minute, you stay 
right here."  I says, "Oh, my God.  What th
ey going to  do me now?"  And he said, "Hey , 
send somebody back here 
for that kid, he'll be able to 
see Hitler." An SA man came back 
and put me on his shoulder, took me to th
e front line.  And I'm sitting th ere and 
everybody's hollering, "Heil H itler, heil Hitler."  And my fath
er taught me when that 
happens, anytime at all, say, "Freie leiter, fre
ie leiter."  It sounds almost the same, but it 
means free leaders, you know. I'm hollering ther
e, "heil -- freie leite
r, freie leiter, freie 
leiter."  And all I kept thinking is if somebody across the street sees 
me sitting on top of -
- top of th at man in his SA unifo rm, this little 
Jewish boy, they're g o ing to tear me apart.  
But then  I said I'm having a good time. So fina
lly, they let me out.  
I went home, I told 
my  mo th er, sh e almo st  
died.  But nothing happened.  Bu
t it was very funny in the end. 
Q: Now, that's -- was that still -- 

A: Also, while Hitler was getting into
 power, this was about '36, -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- when I was in fifth grade.
  One of the professors -- we
 had professors in high school 
-- he took the class on a trip to a certain to
wn where they had a mu seum.  And he said, 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
16 
"We're going to  spend the weekend th ere, so 
get your parents' perm
ission," which I got.  
And we took a bus and we went out there. 
 And we were in a 
youth hostel wh ere we 
slept, because we stayed there.  We went th
ere Friday afternoon. 
Saturday morning, we 
were around, we were passing th
e time, some kids had a late 
breakfast.  And two persons 
came, two men came in.  They ar
e journalists for the local paper.  And they said to our 
professor, who by the way spoke very funny.  We
 always used to imita
te him.  They said, 
"You know, what are you guys doi
ng here?"  So we told them. 
 He says, I'm professor so-
and-so from the realschule in 
Ludwig shafen and we came he
re to see the mu seum and, 
you know, spend a little time here
. He says, "Wonderful."  He says, "Now, I got a -- I got 
something for you," he says.  
"We are having in our local paper a competition, you might 
say, the mo st Aryan looking boy.
" Do I have to say any mo re? 
 [Laughter] 

Q: Oh, my. 
A: And my professor said, "I don't want to 
bother the kids with something." He said, 
"Why not?  Look that this 
guy over there.  He could wi
n easily."  Lederhosen.  
Everything.  Blond hair, blue eyes.  And my  
professor smiled.  He says, "I don't think 
so." 
Q: [Laughing] 

A: It's funny, but it was cute. 
Q: Oh, my. 
A: All right.  That's part of Hitler's time.  
Then he finally came in
to the full power, like I 
said, in '37 and we knew wh at was going on.  
I had to learn a trade. Now, in Mannheim -- 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
17 
like I said, that's across the 
river, the Rh ein River.  Mannheim has about 300,000 people.  
Well, almo st twice as big as my home to
wn .  And there we had, you know, Jewish 
organizations.  And they advised me, we ha
d two things in the town where you could 
learn a trade, all put together by a Jewish -- 
what do you say?  Not a firm, not a comp any, 
but organization like you here, 
something.  And one was to be a locksmith, which didn't 
really interest me.  And the other one wa
s furniture making. Now, that already was 
something I could have done be
cause even as a child, I was artistic.  I used to draw, I 
used to paint.  Noth ing important, but, I me
a n , you know, it was usually quite good.  And 
I said if I make furniture, I could make some
 fancy things on there and all this sort of 
thing.  That might work out. Then I heard 
that the only Jewish re
staurant in town was 
looking for a cook apprentice.  
I always used to  watch my mo ther in the kitchen, and at 
that time w atching meant a lot of things, like 
pulling the feathers out
 of chicken.  You 
don't know from that.  You do?  And th en y
ou open up the back an
d you go in  and you 
take everything out, including the eggs, wh ich 
are not born yet.  It
 was fun.  You don't 
like that?  I loved it. My mother made co
okies, you know, and I used to stamp the 

different forms out.  When my father caught 
me, I'd get a smack.  "Boys don't belong in  
the kitchen." Okay.  So when th
at came up, I said to my mothe
r, "I'm going to try for this, 
you know, the cooking thing."  
My  father said, "Well, go ah
ead."  I mean, you know, this 
could be my  life or death.  I went over th
ere and I met the man and the woman.  Their 
name was Schloss (ph). 

Q: Now, sorry, at this 
point you had planned alre
ady to leave Germany? 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
18 
A: Yeah.  I didn't  know -- I didn't know how ye
t, but, I mean, I felt if I got out, because at 
that time already there was a quota system 
fro m America for German
 Jews.  And you had 
to apply at the consulate in 
Frankfurt to go to America,
 but you had to wait till your 
number was called.  My sister they registered 
right away, and she left about a year and a -
- almost a year before I did. Now, my numbe
r was 13,000 something.  I should know th at 
by heart, but I don't.  And wh en my  -- I had re
latives in the -- in Am
erica.  They weren't 
relatives lik e you might say.  My father had 
three brothers and one sister.  Four boys.  
They were all in the German 
army.  I got a picture home, the four of them lined up, you 
should see them.  Mustache ev
ery one of them, you know. An
d two of the brothers had 
married two sisters.  And th e sisters had brot
hers.  One was in America quite early.  He 
was a chemist.  And he got a job here in America.  He was a doctor of chemistry, 
working for Houten Company.  
Do es that name mean anything
 to you?  Is it Houten?   
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Chocolates, yeah. 
A: Houten, yeah.  Houten ma
de chocolates.  And they us
ually had peppermint patties 
covered with chocolate.  Now, at that time if
 you made that and yo
u put chocolate over it, 
it would crumble, it wouldn't stay.  He found 
a chemical process where the chocolate and 
the peppermint would stay together and ke
ep for God knows how long. His brother, who 
was much younger, worked for my father in the store.  My
 father taught him to -- how to 
be salesman.  And then  he went to America to
 his brother.  So the relatives they had here 
after a while were the two other brothers w
ho had married the two sisters of these two 
boys.  You have to make a fam
ily  tree. And my father told 
them, he says, "I registered 
Eric."  And they send a telegram, and it says
, "Don't be stupid, go get your own number." 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
19 
And my father wrote back and says, "Oh, by that time," it says, "I'l l be gone."  He says, "I 
was in the German army, I have an IM cro
ss, they won't bother me."  Little did they 
know. 

Q: So your parents --  

A: And they --  

Q: -- had not --  
A: And they sent back -- they sent back a 
telegram, "Do it today.  We know more than 
you do."  So mething like this.  Okay.  I'm not 
quoting verbatim.  So 
he did.  From -- from 
13,000, it went out to 22,000.  And Americ a allowed in about at that time 6,000 or 

something.  It was very -- was min u te -- 
very minute a thing here. We in Germany 
thought that Roosevelt was our friend.  Hitle
r thought he was Jewish
 because Roosevelt, 
you know.  And we just couldn't
 b elieve that -- that this c
ould happen, but it was, so he 
couldn't do anything about it. 

Q: Now, what had your 
parents planned to do? 
A: My parents planned to stick it out. 
Q: They tho
ught they -- 
A: I mean, after all, he was 
a German soldier and all that. 
Q: Did you try to convince them to leave? 

A: Not only that, I me an, what could they  
do?  They had to wait until their number was 
called. 

Q: Did you try to convince them to -- 

A: Did I try? 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
20 
Q: -- to get out earlier? 
A: Well, I told them, I says, "I'm going."  
I says, "But I know "-- and my father says, 
"Don't worry about it."  He says, "You're a y o ung
 person, you'll get out." So here I was in 
my second year of cooking appr
en ticeship and my father thought of writing to a friend of 
his in England.  No w, they were -- had -- they
 used to be very, very good friends, but this 
was years ago.  And I remember the only tim
e they used to be in contact was Rosh 
Hashanah  and Yom Kippur, they  used to send
 a letter, y ou know, card or something. So 
he wrote a letter to his friend and he says here
's the situation, I have a son, he's now 16 
years old, going on 17, which is almo st army
 age, you know, and he
's been working as a 
cook apprentice.  Is th ere anything you ca
n do that maybe somebody over there would 
hire him or something? Becau
se if you had a j
ob promise by an Eng
lish company, you 
had to deposit a hundred  pounds with the E
nglish government so 
you wouldn't be a 
burden to  them, and then you would get a Germ
an -- from Germany an affidavit.  I have 
the book right here. And so  he wrote.  He
 got a letter back from his wife, "Your friend 
has passed away.  The only thing I can thin
k of," he said -- she says, "We have a 
magazine here that comes out once a month.
  And now before the summer is coming" -- 
this was probably Novemb er the year before
, '39 -- "I'm sending you something," like we 
have a Jewish news in -- in -- in Newark.  
And in the back, they 
had advertising, you 
know, hotels for the summer here and there.  
And there were two pages of hotels.  I wrote 
to almo st 30 of them -- and this was handwr
iting, there was no copy machine -- that I've 
had this experience.  And already 
this was after Kristallnacht --  
Q: I want --  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
21 
A: -- which was November --  
Q: I want --  
A: -- '38.  All right. 
Q: I want to hear about your experiences --  

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- during Kristallnacht as well. 
A: And they  -- they realized what was going on.
  There were eight pe
ople that wrote back 
we'll take you, so now it was up to me to say,
 you know, who do I ta
ke.  Now, this one 
was a small hotel right near
 the beach and I like the 
beach, and I took them. 
Q: Where exactly?  Where? 
A: That was in Cliftonville, Margate, England.
  Not far from the bloody cliffs of Dover.  
And I wrote to him and says I'm 
very happy and I'll be there,
 you know. So then we said 
my  sister who'll be in America borrowed mone
y from this one uncle who used to be my  
father's  apprentice, and whatev
er money sh e may have had, a
nd sh e sent it to England.  
They had the letter fro m this man in England 
that he was taking me, so I got a permission 
to leave Germany in June 1939, which is th
ree months before the war broke out. My 
father, I remember, accompanied me on the trai
n all the way up to the Dutch -- to the belt 
-- to the Holland border.  Then
 he get off, it was a little te
ary goodbye on his part.  I 
thought I was going for an adventure, you kn
ow. And I went to London.  I had a wooden 
case like th is that had to be sent
 on.  I had packages.  I'm sta
nding there, this -- this place 
there where all the trains come
, the train station, the Englis
hmen with their bowler hats 
and umbrella under the arm typica
lly.  And here stands this little German refugee.  And I 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
22 
finally said to someb
ody, "Can I ask you something?"  An
d finally I found out I had to do 
this and this and this.  I had a fe
w dollars left that I had changed. 
Q: Did you -- 
A: And I was able to get a train going to Margate. 

Q: Did you speak English at this point? 

A: I had six years of English in  school. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Which means very little.  But at least I co
uld ask questions.  When
 they answered me, 
I had to say langsam or slowly, you know, or
 something like that. I went down there by 
train.  First I had to send everything that
 I had by thing over here.  And I came to 

Cliftonville, Margate, Cliftonv
ille.  The man met me and he 
took me to this little hotel, 
and I was now an  English chef. 

Q: I want to pause there for a se
cond.  I want to go back to -- 
A: Go ah ead. 

Q: -- to Kristallnacht. 

A: To what? 
Q: To Kris- -- to Kristallnacht. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And I want to hear, 
you know, your experience
s and did you witness -- 
A: My experience Kristallnacht was very stra
nge.  I was still working in the hotel -- I 
mean, in the restaurant.  All right.  I ha
d gotten sick and I had pneumonia, I guess, 

whatever it was.  And I had a doctor.  He wa
s coming to the house.  And he said to my  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
23 
mo ther keep him warm, give him a lot of 
liquids or something like that.  And I was 
running like 102 temperature.  And that's th
e night this boy killed that man in France. 
Now, this was actually November 10th.  Little did I know what was going to be the result 
of this, but then I heard th
at our synagogue was burning.  And my mo ther was saying, 
"Oh, my  God, they 're burning everything."  I 
got out of bed, wh ich 
I shouldn't have, and I 
went to the balcony.  And we -- across the st
reet from we lived, this was already now in 
Mannheim because once my father lost the st
ore, we had to give
 up our two apartment 
houses.  They paid him bupkis. And so we moved to Mannheim.  We had a small 

apartment, but it had three bedrooms and that 
was good.  My mother and father in one, I 
was in one, and then  we had another one w
ith our relatives coming and going. I went to 
the balcony and I see there down on the street
 a big, big circle.  And in the meantime -- 
meantime there was a Jewish stor
e.  They broke the glass, ev
erything in  there, threw out 
in the street.  Then they went
 to the second floor where th
e people lived and they threw 
out their beddings and ever
ything and set it on fire. 

Q: Who did this? 

A: The Nazis, the stormtroopers.  Not the 
SS, the brown -- Brownshirts. And th e people 
were dancing.  And I said, "What is this?"  
And my  mo th er called me, says, "You go back 

to bed right now and stay there."  And says, 
"It's very bad.  I don't know wh at's  going to  
happen us to, but you're not goi
ng to be..."   I went back to bed, and about a half an hour 
later, the bell rings.  Two Blackshirts, SS.  
And th ey come in and they say, "We're 
looking for your son and your husband." To this
 day, I don't know wh ere my  father was.  
He wasn't h o me.  And I didn 't see him for 
three days.  Apparently
 somebody, wherever 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
24 
he was, told him don't go home. I'm there a
nd my  mo ther says, "My husband isn't home.  
He went to visit somebody."  I don't know wh
at she said.  And they
 said, "All right, get 
him dressed."  Sh e says, "You can't do that."
 "What do you mean we can't do that?  We 
can do anything we want." Sh e says, "My 
son has pneumonia.  If you take him out, you 
know wh at's going to happen."  He says, "I
 don't care.  Get him dressed."  She says, 
"Please do me a favor."  She says, "Let me 
call the doctor and you sp
eak to the doctor."  
The doctor luckily was ge
ntile. So they called him up and th
ey told him, he says, "We're 
picking up Eric Hamberger."  He
 says, "Well, I mu st tell you the truth.  If you take him 
out of bed and take 
him down the street, you might as 
well shoot him right now because 
he ain't going to  last." "What are you saying, 
Doc?"  He says, "Look."  He says, "I belong 
to the party," which, you know, was a good thin
g.  And, all right, they left.  That's why 
I'm here. B u t that was my experience on Kris
tallnacht.  It happened 
to me, as far as I 
know, on the 10th.  I think th
ey say now it was on the 11th. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Ninth.  Ni
nth and 10th, they -- they  say. 
A: Oh, 9th and 10th. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Yeah. 
A: Oh, th e one was 9th and the other one was th
e 10th.  Okay . And after that, they ru ined  
my -- the restaurant.  They -- ev
erything was ruined .  Couldn't  
go back to work there.  So 
I heard about a pension.  Pension is a place 
w h ere people go to eat
 for lunch and dinner, 
but they  don't live there or anything like th at. 
 You know, people just want a meal. So I 
went there and I asked the woma
n, "Can you use me?"  She sa
id, "Sure."  So I used to 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
25 
cook in the morning an
d then I used to be the waiter wh
en the people came to eat.  And 
finally the day came when I went to En
gland.  So th is was that period. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Our synagogue was burned to  the ground. 
 There is now a black sign there, a metal 
sign, you know, on this place here, this a
nd this happened and all that, you know.  My 
father and mo ther did not
 get out, but they  lived. 
Q: So let's go back -- sorry. 

A: My father and mother stayed in Germany -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- because, like I said, their number was now
heres near being called.  And they stayed 
there longer than most peop
le because my mutti, which is
 what I called her, mutti -- M-
U-T-T-I -- was Aryan.  So they
 had a special privilege, they'r
e not going to kill an Aryan, 
so the father -- so my father
 stayed out of the concentra
tion camps until I think 1943. War 
ended in '4 5, right?  Yeah. Then  they pi
cked  him up anyway and they took him to 
Theresienstadt.  Now, Theresienstadt was th
e best thing of concentration camps you can 
think of.  You probab ly know the 
story.  My father told me.  
He sp oke very little about it.  
The first two streets he said were very nice. 
 People lived there.  We had coffee and cake 
there outside the konditorei.  And we ha
d a band playing, but -- not a band, but 
mu sicians, you know, with violins and ev
erything. Whenever so
meb ody  co mplain ed  
about concentration camps, they 
asked the Red Cross to please come and insp ect it.  And 
that's what they showed
 him, those two streets.  My fath
er said the third street on, you 
wouldn't want to go and you didn't go and yo
u weren't allowed to go. My father stayed 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
26 
alive in the concentration camp.  He was -- 
like I said, he was only a little man , didn't 
weigh very mu ch.  Was about 120 pounds.  And th
ey put him in the kitchen.  My  father at 
that time was about 64 years old.  And he
 was peeling potatoes 
all day long. Another 
fellow who was in the same hutch or -- wh
at the word hutch ar
ound there?  Well, 
whatever.  Who was all there in there.  He 
was peeling onions.  And what they  did, my  
father stuffed his pockets with potato peels. 
 The other one had onion peels.  And when  
they finally were able to go 
to their barracks -- barracks, that
's the word I was looking for 
-- they used to make a potato onion soup.  It
 was not bad.  They 
lived. Even though my 
father came out, wh en I finally found him al
ive and as a United St
ates soldier, which I 
was, he had special privileges.  I was -- I 
was a decorated soldier and I got them on the 
second boat coming here.  My father weighed 
86 pounds.  That's a skeleton.  But we got 
him back to -- to -- to health.  What else? 
Q: Let's go back to 1939 -- 
A: Go ah ead. 
Q: -- when you were in England. 

A: In England. 
Q: So you're in England. 
 And -- you're in England. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And, you know, where did you live and 
who helped  you while you were there? 
A:Okay.  Nobody.  I was wo
rking there.  The man -- th
e place was called Ben-Ann 
House.  B-E-N dash A-N-N.  He was Ben 
and she was Ann.  Became Ben-Ann House.  
All right.  And Ben-Ann House ha
d about 60 rooms to rent, so
 it wasn't a big hotel.  But 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
27 
the kitchen on the bottom was small, but wh
en the people came 
for the summertime, 
everybody got the same meal. 
 In other words, if liver 
whatever was on the menu, you 
better like liver.  And mashed potatoes and ve
getables and stuff like that. He was very 
good to me.  The man weighe
d about 300 pounds.  Was a 
big fellow.  About 6'4", 300 
pounds. It was -- it was orthodox.  The meat ha
d to be koshered with
 salt and everything 
else, which I never knew anything befo re, but he
 showed me.  And in part of the kitchen, 
there was a big metal thing where there were sh
elves, and that's where the food was kept 
hot until, you know, it was time to serve it.  
Then he had some waiters.  A waitress was 
inside. She was very nice to me.  S h e was not 
a very pretty  girl, pretty wo man, but she 
was a good woman.  They had two children, a bo
y and a girl. And in back  of th e hotel, if 
you went out the back, there was a long, lo ng way wh ere you could play soccer if you 
wanted to.  I mean, was a really
 good thing.  But also was a 
lot of small little huts there.  
And at one point wh en the war broke out in Se
ptember of '39, he took in  all the children 
from the children transport and he
 put them in those huts in the back and in every one of 
the rooms after the people left. So I can only 
say he was a good person.  He helped me, 
he saved my  life and these kids.  Well, I mean
, they -- at that time 
they put them with 
English people. And I heard so many stories th
at some of them when
 they said
 goodbye 
to their parents, you know, they  knew it was goi
ng to  be the last time.  Some of them did 
find their parents.  Was a long story.  And th
ey wind up with Englis
h people, and a lot of 
them stayed with those people.  We lost 
them as Jewish childre
n.  We lost them 
completely. But anyway, I had 
ab out 45, 50 boys.  Boys onl
y, boys only.  And I'd -- only 
I -- did I cook fo r them, I joined them in putti
ng on plays.  And he 
would sell tickets to 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
28 
the Jewish people in the town to  -- because the dining room had a stage in the back.  And 
I painted the backdrop.  I had a beautiful pa
inting of th e Seven Dwarfs.  Took me quite a 
long time because I had to do
 it in between lunch and dinner, you know.  And the kids 
played. 

Q: Now, wh ere did -- you said he took them
 in.  And where did they -- where did they 
stay?  Did he stop taking guests 
at this point or he put them
 where there were no guests? 
A: At that time, they were all in the huts.  
He took them in, but no
t right away.  When I 
got there, there was no children 
there.  But when th
in gs got back  and, you know, we -- we 
find out that the war's going to  start, he put th
em in those huts.  But at that time, maybe 
three or four in one of those huts.  And late
r on, it was maybe two.  But they were there 
before the war, before the war started, yes.  As
 a matter of fact, my  cousin was one of the 
Kindertransport, but she 
wasn't in that group. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  And then after th
e season, the hotel didn't have guests. 
A: After the season, the guests left, then he 
gave the rooms to the boys.  The boys.  No  
girls. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: What am I talking about?  Yes, were girl
s.  Had a girlfriend.  Sorry.  How could I 
forget her?  Also blond and bl
ue eyes.  We made a good pa
ir.  She was a little stuck up.  
But anyway... 

Q: So you assist ed him w
ith -- with over -- with looki
ng after these children? 
A: Yes.  I became their -- their -- the peopl
e who took care of these children was a 
husband and wife in their 60s, 
who both were professors.  No
w, they were put in charge 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
29 
of them.  And there were -- well, this wasn't 
exactly their field, but
 they, you know, kept 
them in line and I became their 
second leader.  I mean, I -- I 
was more in charge of them 
than they were.  But we had 
a good time together.  And matter of fact, I formed  a little 
gang there, four fellows and I.  We did all 
right. And then later on, a lot of the children 
went to people in London becau
se this little blond girlfriend 
was transferred to London.  
And my other friend who 
was part of my little gang there, 
his girlfriend went to London.  
I saw them later on.  When I -- when 
I got a week vacation, I went there. 
Q: Now, these friends of y
ours were part -- had they co me to England thro ugh the 
Kindertransport or they had also he
lped to oversee 
the younger ones? 
A: Kindertransport. 
Q: Okay . 

A: But some of them -- I m
ean, I was at that time 18 years 
old.  Some of them were 15 
and 16. 
Q: Okay . 
A: One was 17.  So  was almo st, you know, that 
-- I was one of them because of age wise.  
When I left England the following yea
r, was already the bomb ings going on. 
Q: And how did you gain entry into 
the United States at that point? 
A: How did I get entry?  Very interesting. 
I registered with the American consulate in 
London with  my  number, my  quota number.  And wh en th at quota come -- number came 
up, I got a letter that on so and so and so and 
so date, I should appear
 to them because my 
number came up and they will now 
give me permission to go to
 America if I'm healthy or 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
30 
whatever the case may be.  That's  how I got 
there.  And I went to Eng- -- I went to 
America on the way via 
Canada in May 1940. 
Q: And you had said the war, ther
e were bombings, you saw bomb ings? 
A: There was already bombings in London, a
nd they  had the balloons up with th e iron 
things.  I don't know if you rememb er that.  
The English put up th
ose balloons, so when 
the planes -- planes came to bomb it, if th
ey would hit, you kn
ow, one of those iron 
things, it's like a -- a rope but made out of 
-- out of metal, then 
the wing would come off, 
you know. I landed -- I landed in
 Canada after being sea sick.  And the fellow who shared 
my cabin in the boat, very nice fellow.  We 
got along very well even
 though he was like 
20 years older than I was.  And when  we came
 to Canada, we landed in Montreal.  And 
we had ab out a day and a half befo re we coul
d catch a train going to New York , so we all 
went and took a lock  -- a look at
 Montreal.  And wh en I came 
back to the boat, I noticed 
that I had been pick-p ocketed.  I must have 
had about 40 or 45 dolla
rs left in my back 
pocket, and I never carried money in the back
 since then, it's over here. And I -- I said, 
"What am I going to  do?"  So  he says, "I can 
loan you 10 dollars."  
My -- I'm g lad he was 
still there, you know.  Sometimes
 people came to pick them 
up in Montreal.  So I had 10 
dollars when I came to New 
York. Now, I had to send my
 -- my -- my  wooden box and 
every other piece of furniture that I had. 
 And I came to Newark
 where my so-called 
uncle lived.  He was the brother of one of th
e sisters, like I mentioned before.  I hadn't  
told anybody I was coming.  This is one of th
e things I do, I like to surprise people. So I 
took my two suitcases that I 
carried.  All the other stuff was going to  his house.  And I 
went outside the train station, I see a taxi. 
 I asked somebody, "I'm  going to Roseville 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
31 
Avenue in  Newark.  Do  you know where it is?"  He says, "I don't know."   He says, "Why 
don't you take a taxi."  "Okay." I got into th
e taxi and I had a dollar and 48 cents left.  
And I said to the guy, "Do you 
know Roseville Avenue?"  He 
says, "Sure."  Only I didn't 
say it like that then.  "Can yo
u tell me, please, where the Rose
ville Avenue is?"  And he 
looked at me like I'm from the moon or somepl
ace.  He said, "Sure." He took me -- I'm 

sitting in the back.  And you have to see this
 picture.  There's th
e man sitting there.  
Here's the meter.  20 cents.  Twen- -- 20, ye
ah , cents, 40 cents, 60 cents, 80 cents, 90 
cents.  I said if he goes to a dollar, tell hi
m to stop no matter where it is.  95 cents, we 
stop.  I made it. I go out and I give him a dolla
r and I say, "Keep the change, sir."  And he 
looked at me and he said, "Well, thank you 
very mu ch."   And I'm standing th ere with my  
two suitcases.  I says, "Why is he
 so nasty?  I give him a ni
ckel tip and he's telling me 
thank you very much."  As he
 pulled away, I see on the back 
door 35 cents anywhere, any 
part of the city.  I gave him a nice tip. 
Q: [Laughing] 
A: And I went to the house to see my  uncle, 
and he had moved.  He wasn't living th ere 
anymore.  That's  what I get for not calling ah
ead.  But luckily it was only four blocks, so 
I took my full suit- -- 
my suitcase and I got there and I ra
ng the doorbell.  And this uncle 
opened up and he said, "Yes?"  
I says, "I'm Eric." "You're Er
ic?" "Yeah." Took me in.  I 
called my  sister.  She dropped dead  on the 
floor.  Not exactly.  Bu
t she passed out when 
she --  

Q: Where was --  

A: -- heard my  voice. 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
32 
Q: Where was she living at the time? 
A: She was not living at a specific place.  
My sister, because she had her -- better her 
English, was at that time a nanny.  So she 
-- I had the telephone number.  I called her up 
and she came that night.  I says, "When you come
, bring me 10 dollars."  I said -- I said -- 
or 15 dollars, something like that.  And she 
came and we had a happy reunion.  And she 
got her money back from England. And -- but 
I rang my  uncle's bell with 48 cents.  40 or 
28, I remember. 

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  I remember 2 8 , but... 

A: 28, 28, well, 
then, yeah, 28. 
Q: And you lived -- 

A: And then  I said, "What am I going to  do no
w?"  So my uncle said there is a HIAS -- 

HIAS, was that one of th
e companies back then? 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Hebrew 
Immi grant Aid So ciety, HIAS . 
A: Yeah.  It's down in -- in Newark.  I caught  a bus down there on the second day.  And I 

went there and I asked the people there if they
 could help me find a job.  And th ey asked 
me, "What do you do?"  I says, 
"Well, I've b een a cook a
ppren tice now for two years and 
I'm pretty good at wh at I do." So th ey said, "Y
ou're very lucky, we just had a call in this 
week.  There's a nightclub in Chatham."  
I didn't know where Ch atham was.  They 'r e 
looking for a young cook, you 
know, somebody -- refugee, 
somebody. So  I took th e bus 
out there, took 35 minutes to ge
t there, and in my  best English I applied for the job and I 
got the job.  The head  chef was from Holla
nd.  Spoke very good German.  The second 
chef in charge was from Germany, he speaks
 very good German.  And I was there, and 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
33 
then we had a salad chef. And I had a room, a
nd upstairs it was -- you kn
ow Jersey at all?  
Well, what we have in New Jersey, near that
 Chatham place -- as a matter of fact, it was 
built exactly where the nightcl
ub used to be, which burned
 down during World War II.  
There is now a big, big mall.  
What's the name of that mall? 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Short Hills Mall. 
A: Short Hills Mall.  And I lived there up on th
e top of this hote- -- of this restaurant, I 
don't know what it was before because it had 
a -- had a second floor and a third floor.  
Second floor had the offices.  
I k n ow the office girl was ups
tairs.  [Coughing]  Excu se 
me. And I had my  fo od, I had my place to live.
  I was working 10 hours a day, six days a 
week.  Now, the 10 hours a day are not that 
simple.  I worked from 
1:00 to 3:00, that's  
lunchtime.  I was off from 
3:00 to 6:00, up 
on the third floor.  And then from 6:00 till 
1:00, I work ed the night and I 
was the night chef.  There wa s actually 13 hours of the day 
that you couldn't  do anythi
ng. And it was out in -- you know, it was on a hill, this 
restaurant and this building.  If I wanted 
my  laundry done, I had 
to walk about four 
blocks into the town
.  But anyway, I stayed there mo
re or less until I was drafted. 
Q: Then wh en were you drafted? 
A: In 1942. 
Q: And tell me about -- you know, tell me
 about your experiences in the Army. 
A: There's too many. 
Q: Well, how long did yo
u serve in the Army? 
A: I was in the Army for three years. 
Q: And where were you -- 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
34 
A: I was drafted, I went to Fort Dix.  What
 happened to me in Fort -- nothing comes easy, 
but always is a lot of fun in  a way.  I went 
to Fort Dix and I was wearing a pair of brown 
and white shoes.  They call th
em spectators.  You ever hear
 of them?  You know what 
spectator shoes are?  From this brown, then
 comes the part that's
 white, and then it's 
brown ag ain and the back has a white stripe. 
 Fancy. I got there, they gave me my  
uniform.  Put it on.  It was rough.  You kno
w what I mean?  The Ar
my  unifo rm is made 
from not the best material.  And my shoes we
re killing me, those -- you know, I had high 
shoes and you had to  crisscross 
and tie them up.  So  in th e evening, we had -- we had to  
stand -- not Reveille.  What wa
s -- Reveille was the morning. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  In
sp ection?  Inspection? 
A: Well, it was an evening inspection.  A
nd I took those boots off and put on my  
spectator shoes.  Big mistake.  I'm sta
nding out there with a few hundred people.  
Everybody had their Army  boots on but Eric
. And the first sergeant came by and he 
looked.  He said, "Who the... 
do you think you are?" "I don'
t know, sir."  I mean, __+.  
He says, "You pimp ing days are over, buddy."
  He says, "You may have been  in New 
York  with those shoes, but you don't wear th
em here.  You have KP for the next nine 
days." "What did I do wrong?"  I found out. So
 anyway, I got my papers, then I went to 
Camp Rucker, Alabama, also known as -- ex
cuse the language -- the asshole of the 
United States.  It was horrible. 
 It was dry.  Dust swirling all over the place.  90 degrees 
every day.  And that's where I had my  basi
c training. Now, I go, 
you know, when you -- 
when you go in the Ar
my, they ask you this question and 
this question and th is questions.  
You take an IQ test and all these sort of th
ings.  And I come to 
this one fellow and he 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
35 
says, "I understand you were a cook, a chef." 
 I says, "That's right."  So he says, "All 
right, let me ask you a few questions."  He sa
ys, "What are the three main meats?"  I says, 
"Well, there's calf, there's a -- there's cow,
 there's chicken." Ok ay .  He asked me a few 
more questions.  He says, "What do you call a 
piece of meat, a thin piece of meat and you 
put like a cucumb er inside and you roll it up?" And I said, "Rolled beef." "No." I said, 
"What do you mean no?" "That's nobody says 
here." I said, "That's rolled beef." "No." 
Okay .  I'm not -- I'm wrong, he
's right. And then to -- to 
Fort -- to Camp Rucker in 
Alabama, and naturally I was put
 into the kitchen. 
 I didn't have to do any KP anymore, 
but I cooked the way I know how. 
Q: And what is KP? 
A: Kitchen patrol. 

Q: Kitchen patrol. 

A: That's p eeling potatoes, washing dishes, all 
the stuff that nobody el
se wants t o  do.  So 
I went to the kitchen.  Now, the kitchen ge
ts every Monday -- or I guess was Monday -- a 

menu for the week.  On Monday, 
it's potatoes and goulash or wh
atever it is.  And the next 
day, it's chicken wings or something.  A
ll kinds of stuff.  And you had to follow it 
because it was sent to you for that day in 
the proportion of how 
many people you were 
feeding. Now, in certain things I didn't ca
re, like on the mornings
, you know, you have 
either a cereal or, very famous in the Army
 -- excuse me -- shit on shingles.  You ever 
hear that one?  No.  It's shot 
-- it's ground meat in a -- in a cr
eam sauce.  Yeck.  Horrible.  
But that was one of the dish -- dishes. But 
the funny th ing was that really gave me a 
reputation -- I have two reputations -- we ge
t a menu in that on M
onday we 're having 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
36 
chopped meat.  And you had to  grind it y
ourself, you know.  And on Thursday, we're 
going to  have steak.  Okay.  I opened the pack
age for the chopp
ed meat.  It's fro m the leg, 
it's from th e neck, it's  
-- I mean, I know my stuff.  And I 
said to the head cook there, I 
says, "I ain't going to make chopped meat out 
of this."  I mean, I'm  -- no, wait a minute, it 
was -- I'm sorry.  It was steak meat.  Very, ve
ry good steak meat.  A lmost filet mignon, it 
was that great.  And I said to him, "I'm not goi
ng to make chopped meat out of that."  He 
says, "We have to do what it says."  He 
says, "Look the other 
way, I'll take the 
responsib ility.  All right?" "Okay.  Go ah ea
d." I served -- instead of ch opped meat on 
Monday, I served steak.  And the whole plac
e went bananas.  And the captain who was 
the captain of my  comp any, he says, "Oh, is 
that good."  I said, "I
t's better than chopped 
meat, sir?"  He goes, "What are you talking ab
out?"  I said, "You were supposed to get 
chopped meat today." "And you di
d something else?" I said, "Si
r."  I says, "I am a trained 
chef."  I says, "I wouldn't take th at meat
 and make chopped meat out of it." So on 
Thursday , we had ch opped meat. 
 No big deal.  All right.  Th
at was the good part.  Gave 
me a reputation, he really knows what he's do
ing. A guy comes in one day, a sergeant.  I 
was a private.  And he comes back there to 
where we're cooking ther
e.  There 's the mess 
hall, and the kitchen is in the back.  And 
he says, "What are you eating today, Jew boy?" 
"Say that again." "Yeah.  I sa
id what are you eating today, Jew boy?"  I said, "Thank you 
very much."  I said, "I'm gl
ad everybody heard it." I took my
 apron off.  I went to the 
captain 's office and I said, "Sir."  I says, "I 
just was insulted because of my  religion and I 
will not take it."  I says, "I will -- I'm fro m Germany, I suffered under Hitler, I w ill not 
suffer under American sergeant." Called th
e guy in.  He says, "This fellow here 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
37 
complains about you."  He said
, "All I told him, I called him 
a Jew boy."  He says, "Tak e 
those stripes off."  He says, "You're a private.
" I swear to God.  And he never made more 
than a corporal until the end of the war.  Yeah
.  And when -- when we
 finally parted at 
the end, you know, that we were going home 
-- at least I was going home.  The other part 
of the comp any didn't have e
nough points, if you know anyt
hing about points.  He came 
over to me and he says, "Eric, 
you had guts."  I says, "That's 
right."  He says, "I respect 
you." And he always tr
ied to be friendly.  Like if somebody sn eezed, he spoke a little 
German, so he'd  say gesundheit, especially 
(?ein kind im liep?) which means gesundheit 
health.  It's better than carry
ing a baby.  Is rhymes, you k
now. But anyway, that was the 
two things th at happened in cam
p.  But I got my training, tr
aining with a rifle.  And we 
had heavy mo rtars.  You know
 what a mortar looks like? 
 You do?  You know what a 
mo rtar looks like?  All right.  You take a sh
ell and you put it down a barrel and it flies. 
When we came to Africa, Algeria -- 
Q: When -- when were -- 
A: -- to a city called Oran -- 

Q: When  were you sent overseas? 
A: In 19- -- May nine -- the same May that 
I landed in Canada, or in America actually, 
May -- May -- May 2nd or May 10t
h, May 10th.  That's when 
I landed in Africa, in Oran, 
which is a big harbor town . And I was so hap
py, I looked at the -- at the harbor and the 
ships there.  And I saw a sign here "ne fumez pa
s."  I says, "I had two years of French in  
school, I know what that mean
s.  You're not allowed to sm
oke."  Everybody looked at 
me.  "You speak French?"  I says, "Well, don'
t ask me," I says, "but I know a few things." 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
38 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Wh at was this
, '42 or '43?  You went in in -- 
A: '42, '43.  No, '42 actually. 
 Yeah, '42, because I was in 
for three years. And we were 
sent to a hill outside of Oran, which is a fair
ly  big town where most of the people speak 
French and Arabic.  And we -- we had tents th
ere, big tents we put up.  The ground was 

almost all rocky, all rocks.  And they kept 
us there for a while un
til they found out what 
they're going to do with us
, because these heavy mo rtars were not something th at had 
been used before.  Mor- -- small 
mortars, yes, but not the heav
y one.  Our mortar was this 
big. Finally, they gave us an order that ev
erybody in th e battalion, we were -- bat- -- 
battalion is a little more than 
a thousand, a thousand men.  Everybody th at is called or 
known as an enemy alien, people from Germa
ny, people from Austria, people from Italy, 
even people from Russia, 
are to be separated.  There were 
28 of us.  And we were put in a 
separate little tent, or two tents, as a matter 
of fact.  And my compan
y was told -- this is 
after a couple of months -- was told to go to
 Tunisia.  We are talking about the African 
coastline.  All right.  Algeria is here, Tunisi
a's here.  My company 
was told that they 're 
making the invasion of Sicily, which is th
e little boot on th e bottom of Italy. In the 
meantime, we were there, and 
every day our job was to put 
rocks around this area where 
we had th e tents.  You picked up these bo
ulders and you made a -- a thing th at high, 
which was okay except on the most of these rocks were -- 

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Scorpions. 
A: Scorpions.  Sometimes a word -- I miss a 
word.  I think -- I think it right.  Oh, __. 
Underneath those rocks were scorpions, which 
are not nice.  If they crawl on you and you 
make a mo ve when the tail comes up, and y
ou can die depending how mu ch poison they 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
39 
get in there. And I also learned how to skill 
a scorpion without touc
hing him.  Want to 
learn? Okay.  Scorpion is here, right?  
You take some newspaper or your booklet, 
whatever you have, the paper, 
and you build -- put the paper 
around it and then put fire 
on it.  Now, the scorpion doesn't 
want to go through the fires, 
so he kills himself.  Huh? 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  
That's interesting. 
A: I'm responsib le for a lot of scorpions be
ing dead . But anyway, the other thing we had 
to do is go to the PX there and sell the so ldiers whatever they may need; toothpaste, 
medicine, candy, chocolates, 
prophylactics, all kinds of th ings.  And it was a good job.  
Funny th ing happened there one day.  I don't 
know if you want to hear these stories 
because I got a million of them. 

Q: Well, let's move forward a little bit, so -- 

A: Huh? 

Q: So did -- 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:
  Move forward. 
Q: We'll move fo rward. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Move 
forward.  Move forward. 
Q: We'll go -- 

A: Move forwards, okay. 

Q: We'll go ahead.  So do -- were you i
nvolved in the invasion of Sicily?   
A: Yes, I was, but my outfit wasn't.  Very 
strange, right?  One day we get the notice, 28 
fellows, you're moving out. "Where we going
?" "You're going to  make the invasion of 
Sicily." "Where's my outfit?" 
"They're going to meet you ther
e or you're going to meet 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
40 
them there.  They 're ready to
 embark from Tunisia on a boat 
going on Sicily."  Okay . So 
we get on a boat, we land in Sicily.  
And we're sitting there on the waterfront and 
somebody comes over and says, "What are y
ou doing here?" He says, "Well, we'r e 
waiting for our outfit." "What's 
the outfit?" "84th Ch emical 
Mortar Battalion." "I'll find 
out where they are."  Comes ba
ck.  He says, "They didn't ma
ke it." I says, "What do you 
mean they didn't  make it?  
It's  a whole battalion." They fo
und out -- they were ready to 
get on th e boat, and whoever the general was th
at was going to Sicily, he says, "I can't 
use those big things.  They're completely ou
t of line."  He says, "When we go into 
country over there, it's  silly
.  Sicily has mountains, Mount Etna is there, which is a 
volcano."  He says, "Get those 
guys off." They went off, we 
were there. We saw combat 
before they did.  We were not citizens, wh
ich is not a good thing to be if you take a 
chance being captured by Germans.  And y
ou know when  your dog tags says Hebrew, 
there's an H on there, so, you 
know, it's very easy to read. 
Q: Now, the other men were also -- were th
ey also German Jewish
 immigrants with you? 
A: No, not all. 

Q: Not -- 
A: No. 
Q: Some? 

A: They were Italians.  One was a -- a Ru
ssian guy.  We had a couple from Austria. 
Q: Right. 

A: Most of them were Americans. 

Q: But no -- no citizens? 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
41 
A: But not citizens.  And orig
inally from Germany or Austria 
or Italy. So we were in 
Sicily and th ey said, "Okay."  Says, "We'll ma
ke some  use out of you."  So th ey took us 
to a place where they had donk
eys.  And they loaded the 
donkeys up with packages on 
both sides.  And we got a stick and we led 
the monkeys up th e hill -- the donkeys, not the 
monkeys.  The donkey s up the hill.  And they
 delivered the goods. 
 So whatever they 
need, ammunition, food, someth
ing like that. And then we ca
me down again and we took 
another thing up.  The second time up, the Germ
ans started shelling.  I says, " W ait, you 
know, we -- we don't -- we do
n't have anything here to di
g a foxhole even."  We had no 
spade or nothing.  So we -- we
 -- I jumped on top 
of a foxhole with a 
couple of guys in 
there.  Other guys hid behind trees.  The guys
 in the foxhole threw me out. I ran around, I 
found a tree about this big, an
d the bottom part was hollow.  I've seen that many times on 
trees.  I crawled in there and I fell asleep. 
 The bombing was going up and I felt very safe, 
I fell asleep . When it stopped, I came out and 
I looked around.  One 
of our boys got hit 
already, not killed.  And I said, "This is ri
diculous."  So I asked the captain that was 
running around with his stic
k like he was an Englishman, wh ich he wasn't.  He says, 
"Okay, fellas."  Says, "Go ahead."  He says, "W
e're in a war here.  You can't stay in those 
holes all day."  Ok ay. And then  that's -- I as
ked him, I says, "What are you going to do 
with us?"  I was a PFC, Private First Class. 
 And I said, "Sir, I don't know where we're 
going to  go." "Well, wh at is going on," he says
.  "Well," he says, "we don't belong to  any 
comp any here, not to any battalion, not to an
y division."  He says, "Our people are in 
Africa.  They didn't make the invasion." He 
says, "You know what."
  He says, "Go down 
here."  He says, "There's  the medical plac
e, you know, wh ere all the wounded are being 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
42 
brought down.  See -- go and see if you can 
help out down there." 
We went down there 
and we reported, 27 men strong.  No, we 
had the other guy too.  Yeah, I think he 
wounded his arm.   And we said to the docto r or
 the captain in charge there, he says, "Sir, 
we're supposed to -- supposed to
 help you with any way we 
can."  And he says, "Well, 
who are you?  I don't recognize your in signia.
"  I says, "We belo ng to the 84th Ch emical 
Mortar Battalion, but our outfit is not here." 
"Where is it?" "In Africa." "Then what are 
you doing here?" I says, 
"I don't know, sir."  And he sa
ys, "Okay."  He says, "Why are 
you here?"  I says, "Because we are enemy 
aliens, we are not citizens." "You are not 
citizens and you are up here when the shelling is
 going on?" I says, "Tha
t's rig h t, sir."  He 
says, "Well, get the hell out of here."  He
 says, "Take this man" -- he was on a litter, 
badly wo unded -- "and carry him down there, don'
t come back up." So  four of us picked 
up one litter.  We walked about 
200 yards and the shelling star
ted again.  So we put the 
litter behind a tree and we were all huddled  ar
ound and finally it stopped.  And when  we 
were ready to pick up that litter 
an d I said to them, I says to 
guys he ain 't going nowhere.  
He was dead, not from the she
lling, but he was badly wounde
d. So we brought him back 
to the camp and they  says, "You got a live one?"
  I mean, he was trying to be -- you're 
trying to be funny because, yo
u know, it says -- he says, "Yeah, I got a live one." Then 
we took a guy -- it took us approximately tw o 
and a half hours for the mu les to go up th at 
hill.  Took us two days to ca
rry this guy down.  Was like 20
0 and some pounds.  That's a 
lot, and if you're holding onto that and then  
you're going around boul
ders and all kinds of 
stuff.  So finally we delivered
 him to the Red Cross station 
down there.  And they said, 
"That's enough, you'r e not
 going up anymore." So  then Sicily fell.

A: Wait a minute, I got to tell you this. We
â„¢re leaving Sicily. It
â„¢s not that easy. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Twen ty-eight people including one with an
 arm wound get on a ship going back to 
Africa. Why? Because thatâ„¢s where your outfit 
is. Okay? But they didnâ„¢t take us to where 
the outfit is, they took us back to  Iran. Wher
e we came from with 
all the rocks and the 
animals up there. Animals. Inse
cts. And you just couldnâ„¢t un
derstand it. Well, we finally 
found out that in order for 
you to be a citizen, somebody 
has to come from America and 
from the Immigration Department and he has to
 interrogate you and if he gives the okay, 
then you are sworn in as
 a citizen. I says, okay. They took 
us back to this hill, but before 
we got to the hill, weâ„¢re on the boat, right? No
w Iâ„¢m standing on the bo
at, itâ„¢s early in the 
mo rning about 8 oâ„¢clock. We 
had gotten on th e ship around 
6 oâ„¢clock and I see Sicily, 
you know, in the distance, very clear, and we
 got torp edoed. No th ing should come easy. 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg

But we were lucky again; it was a liberty sh
ip. You know what a liberty ship is? No. A 
liberty ship was built by a fe
llow whose company was Kaiser. He w as Kaiser. K-A-I-S-E-
R. And he built ships with th
e middle separate from the back
. From the front, I should 
say. If you get hit in the back, the front stay
s up. Very clever idea. Saved our lives. We 
made it back to Africa. Nobody was killed. Bu
t we got torpedoed. Wh
en we were back in 
Africa, we were back up on the hill, we we
re selling prophylactics 
again and everything 
else, and then one day he says, today is your 
day. They took us all to a big tent and th ere 
was a screen in between where you couldnâ„¢t
 see and hardly hear anything. We were 
sitting on chairs on the open side. And now weâ„¢re
 called Mr.  so-and-so, sergeant so, 
whatever it was, we go in, one 
guy goes in at a time and we 
hear talking, but we canâ„¢t 
understand anything. And th en
 we hear loud laughter. And this goes on ev ery time 
somebody goes in. Wh en I went in there, 
I gave him my  name, my  serial number, 
everything. Thirty-two, 5-6-0-9-6-2. Right. A
nd he said, well, he sa
id, I have to go over a 
few questions here, he says, yo
u were born here, this and this and this. Yes. Do you have 
any connection with Germany? I said no, myparents are still there, I says, I hope theyâ„¢re 
alive. And he says now comes the important 
question. Whatâ„¢s the important question? He 
says, now listen carefully, do 
you mind fighting ag ainst the country  of your birth? And I 
got hysterical, I says, a re you 
kidding me. I al ready fought against the country of my 
birth. He says, I know, I know, every time one
 of you guys comes 
in, everybody breaks 
out in laughter. I says, yeah, I donâ„¢t mind. I 
donâ„¢t mind at all. And then I got my citizen 

papers. My citizen papers say Africa, Iran, ev
erything else. And from there on, I was sent 
back to my outfit. My outfit 
in the meantime had made the invasion of Italy. We werenâ„¢t 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
45 
there, but I made the invasion of Anzio. An
zio was a very, very long and bitter battle. It 
was flat lan d , all farmers there. They took 
the farmers away, but lu
ckily they left the 
animals there. And the Germans were sitting 
on top of the hill. So
 when we got there 
after the invasion, they  gave my  particular 
platoon a farmerâ„¢s house. And we were in the 
back where the cows us
ed to be. Other parts of the comp
any were in different houses, we 
were spread out all over this
 perimeter, and we did nothi
ng but, you know, make sure -- I 
used to sleep in the manger 
where the cows eat the grass 
from. In the meantime, our 
information, or our officers we
re such complete idiots, th ey never even thought about, 
you made the invasion, now letâ„¢s see how far 
you can go. No, they drew a line. Weâ„¢re not 
gonna go further than this because theyâ„¢re probably 
sitting on top. But th
ey werenâ„¢t. They 
werenâ„¢t sitting there at all. The company, the 
battalion, or the division actually that made 
the invasion of An zio, or a lot of them, they 
went in, they lost half of their men after a 
while, because all of a sudden, 
it started raining. Senator Dole
 was there. All right, thatâ„¢s 
where he got that wound there and you kn
ow who else was there? Audie Murphy, the 
most decorated American so
ldier. My buddy, because we
 were supporting the 3rd 
Division, which they were in. 
But anyway, we spent three-and-a-half months there. And 
the only thing good I can tell you is that my
 outfit ate pigeons, chickens, rabbits, pigs, 

calf, veal, and cow meat. I killed them one at 
a time because in the Army, if youâ„¢re in a 
place like this, all you get is cans of C-rations or boxes of K-rations. Either one of them, 
if you live on them for more than
 a week, you just feel like, 
itâ„¢s not worth it. So I cooked. 
And my  captain, one night, he couldnâ„¢t believe 
it, I made stuffed breast of veal. And I 
told him, this is a real ni
ce Jewish dish. So, but I, when 
I landed on Anzio, when  I met 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
46 
my captain there, I said  to th
e captain, he says, I says, Iâ„¢m a 
citizen now, he says, so you 
can send me anywhere you want, I want to be
 at the front. He says wait a minute, wait a 
minute, youâ„¢re not going an ywhere
, the only one that can cook. 
I says, thatâ„¢s right sir, but 
______ exactly my b
ackground, I want to go to the fro
nt. And he was a captain whose 
ancestry comes from P u erto Rico. 
As a matter of fact, his fath
er was a general and he had 
gone to West Point, but he still talked, still 
had a very, very heavy 
accent. When he said 
to me, Hamburg, you want to go the front? I 
said, yes, sir. Okay, I 
went to the front. I 
knew what to do with the mort
ar and I very good with math
 and when you have a mo rtar, 
you have something sitting on the barrel of the 
mortar and you have sticks there. So you 
put your mortar side on that one stick in the middle and the man whoâ„¢s at the map will 
tell you, so many clicks over here, or so ma
ny clicks over here depending wh ere the 
enemy is and I was very good at it. I was th
ere for four weeks and I got a promotion. I 
never was a corporal. I was a sergeant. And I 
stayed as a sergeant un
til almost the end of 
the war, then I became a platoon leader, I 
had 50 men under me, 
and I became a staff 
sergeant.  

Q: Where? Where at this time?  
A: This is now at the Brenner Pass. Betwee
n Italy and -- was it Switzerland or Austria? I 
think itâ„¢s Switzerland. Yeah, Switzerland -- and 
we, at that time, were supporting to the 
10th Mo untain Division, wh ich came very, very
 late, but they had a general in charge 
who had gotten the Medal of Ho nor in Wo rld Wa
r I and he wanted  to get as me dal, as 
many medals as possible in the few months 
that he was there. If a guy fell and cut his 
hand on a can, he got a Purple 
Heart. I mean, we were so mad at them. It was h o rrible.  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
47 
Q: And you are a recipient of the --  
A: Louder. 
Q: -- Bronze, youâ„¢re a recipient of the Bronze Star.  
A: Thatâ„¢s correct. What did I do?  

Q: Can you tell me, how 
did you receive it?  
A: Okay . This was after we got out of Anzi
o and we were going towards Rome. And at 
one point, we still were getting 
some German  shells coming in
, so we moved the trucks, 
so we had to stop th e truck and find so meplac
e to hide. And we found a cave, we were 
supposed to go over an ar
ea that was wide open, but 
that was like trees and little 
mountain part here and further down. And in 
that mountain part, there was a hole, a big, 
big hole like a big cave and thatâ„¢s where we 
all went in. My 50 g
uys. And we had our 
mo rtar set up in  the open, naturally, you ca
nâ„¢t shoot thro ugh a mo untain, and ever so 
often we would shoot and then  
we would run back  to the cav
e and then they  would shoot 
back. One of my boys who was also a mortar 
sergeant got hit. And he
 got hit in the lung. 
And he was lying th ere, I didnâ„¢t know if he wa
s dead or not, but I said to the medical 
man, the, what do they call them? 
MRS. HAMBURG: Medic? 
Q: The medic. 

A: The medic. I says, Iâ„¢m going to get him. 
You come with me. We ran out to them and 
my  friend, Joe Weiler, I mention the name because he comes up again, he went with me. 

He was also a sergeant. And we got to him 
and we picked him up a
nd he was alive. And 
no matter had we picked him up, the shelling st
arted. So ran to the nearest ditch  and we 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
48 
all went into the ditch and I put myself on top 
of this man so he shouldnâ„¢t get hit again. 
And then  we brought him back. Thatâ„¢s why I got a Bronze Star. 
Q: And thatâ€“ 
A: But Joseph Weiler, Jewish bo
y from Brooklyn, all right? 
MRS. HAMBUR G: No, you donâ„¢t have that. 

A: You didnâ„¢t bring it, okay. Itâ„¢s in the Ar
my album. Joe Weiler and I became very good 
friends even in America and Joe, I was at that
 time, in 1942, I was 21 years old, Joe was 8 
years older, so he was 29. We became like 
real close buddies, I called him Uncle Joe. 
Why did I call him Uncle Joe? He showed  me 
a picture of his niece. She was gorgeous, 
mo st gorgeous Jewish girl in America, 
maybe? So I started writing to  her and we 
corresponded for over two year
s. And thatâ„¢s how he became Uncle Joe because if I 
married his niece, he would be my uncle. The 
sad thing is that on the last day of the war, 
we were near a lake -- thereâ„¢s three la
kes, I always get them mixed up --  
MRS. HAMBURG: Garda. 
A: Garda. Lake Gard a. The Germans had bomb
ed out the tunnels th
at went through the 
mountains near the lake, so we went thr
ough th ere, but we couldnâ„¢t go far, too far 
enough, so we had to  come back out, we 
had to take a boat or something, bring our 
mortars way up there. We finally came to the 
end of the lake there and th ey said, okay, 
set your mortars up out there where the grapev ines are and all that. And I had just come 
back from the hospital because th
ree of our boys were killed in an accident with a Jeep, 
not from anybody sh ooting them, and I came back
 and the rations just came in and it was 
my  job to make these rations for this guys, 
no, for this group and this group and this 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
49 
group and this group, so Iâ„¢m breaking it up an
d an order came in for a mi ssion, a shooting 
mission. And it was for my mortar, I say my mo rtar because this one was already in  the 
position to shoot back. I said 
okay Iâ„¢ll take it and Joe said
 no. We always did that, you 
have something to do, Iâ„¢ll find 
your mo rtar, I know where your
 mortar is. And we did that 
all the time, whoever was available- a mortar 
is a mo rtar. And he went down  and I heard 
an explosion and I knew what it was. He was gone. I ran down , one hole here. And I held 

him in my  arms for about two hours. Uncle 
Joe. And if I had gone there, he took my  
place. Okay.  
Q: Okay. How did you feel as
 a German-Jewish immigrant se
rving in the U.S. military, 
during th e war?  

A: Very fulfilled. I had a, what shall I say, I 
h ad to, I had to get even, letâ„¢s put it that way. 
The word I was looking for, I didn
â„¢t get. They  stole my  youth.
 I mean, when they came in 
power, like in 1933, wh
en Hitler became in power, what 
was I, 12 years-old. I still had a 
wonderful time because I was not harassed by any
one in the school. As a matter of fact, I 
reme mb er the day that we graduated, I was 
16. And when  you graduate, the class goes to 
the directorâ„¢s office. Heâ„¢s the principal 
of the whole school, high school. And he 
congratulates everyone separately. All right
? Youâ„¢re standing th ere, yeah? So-and-so 
good, good, good, and he came to me and he 
said, in German, Hambur
ger, fur Juden, bist 
es so Schleicht. Hamburger, my last name, fo
r a Jew, youâ„¢re not to o bad. Thank you God, 
he likes me. Idiot. Okay.  

Q: And where were you at the warâ„¢s conclusi
on? When  the war ended,
 where were you?  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
50 
A: When the war ended, I was at the Brenner Pa
ss, at the top of Italy, going in to Austria, 
no, Switzerland, Switzerland. Thatâ„¢s where I wa
s. Thatâ„¢s where Joe got killed and thatâ„¢s 
where, that was my last mission. Then afte r that, my outfit got together and they said, 
youâ„¢re now going to  go fight in Japan. Bu t th
ey say here in the orders, anybody that has 
mo re than 85 points does not ha
ve to go to  Japan, he goes 
home. Now, in order to get 85 
points, every month that you serv
e, that you were in the Army  
counts as a point, all right? 
Every medal that you have, counts as five poi
nts. Your rating counts as ten points. I had 
96 points. I wasnâ„¢t going to  Japan and so were
 quite a few other guys, so the last Iâ„¢m 
sitting there somewhere didnâ„¢t make any diff
erence. And they took 
us back down to 
Naples and finally at the end caught the boat. My outfit had left. On the way to the United 

States, Japan surrendered. They were
 home before I was. Lucky guy.  
Q: And where did you, where did you live after the war?  

A: Where did I come when  I came home from th
e war? I shouldnâ„¢t even say that. I didnâ„¢t 
go right home.  

Q: Where did you go?  

A: My sister was a, my  sister  who during 
the war was living in 
Michigan, because her 
husband was in service and he had a job up 
in Michig an, she was now living in  Newark  
where I was originally landed. I had such good 
friends on th e boat. It 
took us nine days to 
come back and I went home with one of th
em. He was an Italian-American boy. And I 
stayed there a few days. My sister didnâ„¢t 
know I was coming home anyway, and finally 
one of the fellows there, he got
 a car and we all went there 
and we went to Newark and I 
saw my sist er. I st ayed with 
my sister. I got my job back 
in the restaurant, but not the 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
51 
same one that was on the hill,
 but he owned three restaura
nts, the one on the hill burned 
down. So now I was in Newark. He had a very
 nice big restaurant and I took my  job 
there, but I no lo nger had any desire to cook
. So I made up my mind, my sister had come 
here, sister was a very bright girl, and she 
first worked  as a nanny, she saved up money 
and she took up beauty culture. And sh e became 
a hair stylist. And sh e said to me, I says, 
youâ„¢re very talented in arts, 
I used to paint, I used to dr
aw, I used to do all kinds of 
things, she says, why donâ„¢t yo
u take a course under the G
.I. Bill of Rights. So I says, 
thatâ„¢s an idea. So I went do
wn to the place in Newark wh
ere they gave the lessons and 
the lectures, it was a y ear course. And I signed 
up. Then I went back 
to my restaurant and 
I said I can only work from five till nine. W
hy? I says, because Iâ„¢m g o ing to be a hair 
stylist. Guy says, are you su re going to  come he
re? I says, absolutely. I went to the school 

from nine till four, and then from five till one 
oâ„¢clock, I did cooking. Until the last man 
had left. And when  I graduated 
there, I got a job as a hairdr
esser. And I worked there for 
a few months and I said, I said to my boss,
 it was a Jewish man who used to work  for 
Albert and Carter, which was in, what was that
 big place? Saks Fifth Av enue. In a beauty  
parlor on Saks Fifth Avenue. And I said, Walt
er, I says, I canâ„¢t stay with you. He says, 
why? Everybody likes you. I says, I know, 
I says, but some of these women drive me 
bananas. He says why, what 
did they do. Oh, this curl s
hould be this way and this one 
here should be this way. And you know, Iâ„¢v
e been through too mu ch
 to listen to this 
garbag e here. He says youâ„¢ll get used to it, yo
uâ„¢ll get used to it. I says, well, Iâ„¢m going to 
take some months off.
 And I went to a place in Towaco
 in New Jersey. It was a place 
where, what was the name of
 the outfit that ran that? 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
52 
MRS. HAMBURG: Uh, work manâ„¢s circle. 
A: Workmanâ„¢s circle. Workmanâ„¢s circle. An
d I had worked there before, one summer. 
No that was the first ti me, that was the first ti
me, yeah. I went up there and I got a job. I 
was the only cook th ere, the owner was, he
 knew how to cook, but not mu ch. And I 
worked there for July, 
August, till September. I started in 
June already. In the meantime, 
the hairdresser guy called me, they want you 
back, they want you back. I says, well Iâ„¢m 
going to  finish here. It was a good thing it wa
s where I met her. This beautiful child here 
was 16 years old and she came to the camp 
and the bossâ„¢s wife said , wait until you see 
whatâ„¢s coming in. This girl 
was a counselor last year I 
says, sheâ„¢s 16, and she was a 
counselor at 15. Yes. When 
she came, she w as cute, but a little too heavy. Can I tell â€šem 
how mu ch you weighed? A hundr
ed and seventy-two pounds an
d I said to the woman, I 
says, this is what you want for me? I says, 
w ait until you hear how she laughs, sheâ„¢s very 
funny, sheâ„¢s very cute, sheâ„¢s 
very smart. So I made a mi stake one day. I was ma king 
pancak es for breakfast and everybody came 
with their plates, you know, three pancak es, 
three pancak es, everybody was fed, she came  up to th e counter, can I have mo re? I 
looked at her and I smiled and I says you can
 have more, and thatâ„¢s when she says she 
fell in love with me. I didnâ„¢t
 know. But all during the tim
e that we were out there, 
when ever th e counselors went out I went along w ith them and she sort of attached herself 

to me. So when  some of us over, her girl
friend came to me and she said, are you gonna 
take Sunny out? Thatâ„¢s Sunny.
 Going to take Sunny out wh
en the camp is finished? I 
says, no, Iâ„¢ve no interest in her. Sheâ„¢s cute, 
sheâ„¢s nice, I says, but you know, sheâ„¢s mu ch 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
53 
too heavy for me. So the girlfriend said what if
 she lost weight? I says, Iâ„¢ll tell you what, 
sheâ„¢s now 172. If she, by her birthday in
 Novemb er is 135, Iâ„¢ll take her out.  
MRS. HAMBURG: I think you 
might want to tell them the story about the battlefield 
commission. Your battlefield commission.  
A: Oh, that was my father. Yeah.  

MRS. HAMBURG: Well, 
even the fact that you were recommended. 
A: This is something I should mention. When
 I lived with my  sister and I had already 
started found my parents alive. My father, 
like I said, weighed 86 pounds, my  mo ther 
looked all right, my mother be
cause she was Aryan was not sent to a concentration camp . 
And she managed with  her, actually, it was he
r sister, w ho lived fu
rther away, and her 
sister introduced  her as a girlfriend that 
she knew from high schoo
l or something. So, 
once the war was over, my father was reunited 
with my mother
 and I applied right away  
to bring them to America. And being th at I 
had a rank, that I was decorated, she was on 
the second boat coming here. An
d she also ca me to my si ste
r, who had an apartment with 
two bedrooms, yeah, and a living room that ha
d a couch. Oh, no, that was a little room 
attached to a balcony. The r
oom was about from the mi ddle of th is up to here, but it had a 
cot in it. So if I opened the door, I fell on th e cot and fell asleep. My parents were in the 

other bedroom. One night we 
were having dinner together, 
and I asked my  father a few 
questions about the concentration camp and he sa
ys, I really donâ„¢t want to talk about it, I 
told you about how I kept my self
 alive with the potatoes and 
all that, I says, but I really 
donâ„¢t want to talk about it. It wasnâ„¢t nice
. And I said, do you thi
nk th ey kept you alive 
because you spoke five languages because Ther
esienstadt was known as the elite where 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
54 
all the doctors and th e lawyers, all the educ
ated people. He said 
I donâ„¢t know. He says, 
you know Iâ„¢m glad you made it, 
Papa, he says so am I. I said I want to tell you a story. I 
says, at the end of the war, nine days exac tly after the end of the war, which was March 
2nd -- 

MRS. HAMBURG: May. 

A: May, May 2nd, in Italy, I was notified 
that I was getting a battle
field promotion, but 
because of the war being over, 
they didnâ„¢t need another sec
ond lieutenant, so just let you 
know, you would have made it if the war had 
lasted longer, the war didnâ„¢t last longer, 
okay, youâ„¢re going home. And my  father looked
 at me and his eyes started to water and 
he said, if the war had lasted nine mo re days
, my  son, the newest se
cond lieutenant in the 
American Army  would not have had a father. He
 was on the list to go two days after that 
to Auschwitz. So I looked at him a
nd I said, Iâ„¢m glad I didnâ„¢t get it.  
Q: Thatâ„¢s quite a story. Now 
did you, did you remain as a 
chef or did you go back to 
being a hair stylist after the war? 

A: I told you when I came b
ack, I went right away back 
to cooking for one of the 
restaurants this man owned. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then  I took up going to  
school for hair stylist.  
Q: Right. 
A: So I was a chef until I actu
ally finishedhair-styling scho
ol and got a job as a hair 
stylist.  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
55 
Q: Okay . And, so you met at this camp. Y
ou met your wife at the camp . And wh en did 
you, wh en did you marry?  
A: Four years later.  
Q: Did you have children?  

A: Yes. Four years later because she was 16 
going on 17, thereâ„¢s a 
song like that, right? 
Sixteen going on seventeen? An d she was going 
to co llege the next year. Now, here in 
America going to co llege at 16, thatâ„¢s pretty
 good. Smart girl. But she always says the 
smartest thing sh e did was marry me, I donâ„¢t 
know. But anyway, we decided th at Iâ„¢m not 
going to  marry her while sheâ„¢s going to co lle
ge. Weâ„¢ll wait. And I was in Newark, New 
Jersey, she was in Queens, Ne
w York. My car, after a while, I could close my eyes, you 
knew the way already. And I us
ed to see her on my day off. And it was cute, you know, 
when  we used to say good ni
ght out in Qu eens, I knew that my  last train going to  Newark  
was at 1 oâ„¢clock and then there was nothing 
until 2 oâ„¢clock. Somehow, she managed to 
make me late every time.  

Q: How did you feel about the war in the fi
rst 10-20 years after it
s conclusion? Did you 
seek out other Jewish-American veterans, ot
her Holocaust survivors, or, or not?  
A: I did not join any veterans
 group, because I felt that af
ter what I went through, itâ„¢s 
enough already. But then I got a letter from 
th e Disabled American Veterans and I was 

home about a year when I wa
s getting 20 percent disability. 
Because I was hurt, another 
time, but it was not a bloody hurt, it was wounded 
in a way. We were told to stop the cars 

coming out of Anzio, this was right after Anzi o, and we were riding along a way that has 

a big, big wall here of dirt, you know like, 
ground, the other side was flat. And we got 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
56 
some shells coming in, so it was,
 we were told to dig yoursel
f into the side where the wall 
is very high so, this way, a shell would have to
 fall right in front of that hole to hit you. 
And I was stuck in that hole and I was, I 
canâ„¢t show you because my  back wh at Iâ„¢m 
talking ab out, had my  legs out
 straight and my  legs out st
raight and I was hammering into 
the wall because itâ„¢s a very tough wall, a
nd Iâ„¢m hammering away and Iâ„¢m bent forward 
and a shell hit on top, and I was buried alive.
 Naturally, everybody th
at was around there 
saw that, they were in their holes, and right 
away came over, they  dug me out, I couldnâ„¢t 
breathe, finally got back my  breath back  and I 
went to the hospital. I was in the hospital 
for eight days. And then  I went back to my  ou
tfit and then I got a Purple Heart for that. I 
says, well I guess I didnâ„¢t bleed. But then la
ter on, wh en I was home I once wrote to the 
Veterans Administration and I asked them you 
know you have in y
ou have boys in Iraq 
and you have boys in 
Afghanistan and you have boys on the, wh at was the other one 
before that, and they  can be on a truck, you
 know, and hit a mine or something and get 
hurt, but not bleed, but they ge
t a Purple Heart. Why am I not entitled? And they said you 
are entitled. Okay. Big deal. Now I got
 two. What else did I forget? 
MRS. HAMBURG: You asked so
mething about refugees.  
Q: I wanted to hear the story wh en you retu
rned to Germany after 
the war with two other 
people. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: To your town . 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Can you tell me about that?  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
57 
A: Oh, by th e way, I joined the Disabled Amer
ican Veterans. After I was as a member for 
two years, they made me th
e commander, because I had been the co mmander for Knights 
of Pythias and I know exactly what was goi
ng on. And Iâ„¢m still with them. Iâ„¢m now the 
treasurer for the last six years.
 Now, what else was there?  
Q: Going back to Germany. 
A: Yeah, okay. 
Q: You went back to  Germany.  
A: I never, ever had the desire to go back to  
Germany, even though, I mu st say, I did not 
have a very bad childhood, because of the fact
 that in school, the friends that I had, all 
Gentiles, were all very, very good to me. I 
w as part of them. What
ever happened, Eric 
was part of it. So I canâ„¢t say that I suffered.
 Naturally, when I go to
 school and everybody 
stands there Heil Hitler, I donâ„¢t say Heil Hitle
r, I was alw ays a little shaky, but I had 
training in th rowing a hand gren ad e, I had tr
aining in  rifle shooting. Oh, this is another 
cute one. In the last year I was there, this is
 1937, we had rifle shoo
ting one day, we did it 
in our, we did the gymn asium. All right? And 
they set up a place in 
the back where they 
had a stage, metal pieces so you know and th
en put these signs up 
and you had to shoot 
into the sign like you 
do when you go to a ma
rket or something, not a market. And I shot 
and the fellow next to me, I knew was a very
 good shot because in the summertime he 
used to go with his uncle. His uncle was a fore
ster, in charge of ke
eping the forest clean 
of people stealing animals or some thing like 
that and he always 
had a was a very good 
shot. He won th e shooting, but I came in seco
nd. I was called upstairs to the principal and 
I had two SS  men there, they wanted to 
know where I learned how to shoot. And I 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
58 
belonged at that time in
 Germany to our equivalent of 
the Hitler Youth, which was called 
IPD, Israelitische _______ Deutschland, 
Israeli Boy Scouts of Germany. And they  
thought maybe I could learn how to 
shoot, I says, no, no, no, and...  
MRS. HAMBURG: When  we went
 back to Germany is what
 she asked and I, when we 
went back  to Germany and the 
night we were to, well either 
the night when we first came 
and you spoke and th e night wh en we, it was th
e last night, when  you spoke. I think that 
answers her question about how you felt being back  in Germany. 

A: Yes, but before I go there you just reminded me of something. I didnâ„¢t tell them about 

that trip I took did I? 
Q: No. 
A: With the journalis
ts coming around? 
Q: No. 

A: No. In our sixth straightâ€“ 
MRS. HAMBURG: Yes, yes.  
A: Yes, I did say that. 

Q: Sorry, you did tell me about that. 
A: Yes, I did, I did mention it. Now going to
 back to Germany, my  sister called me one 
time from California. 
Q: What?  
A: She just came back from Germany. She went
 there because they invited her to come 
for two weeks with a guest
 and they would take care of everything.  
Q: What year was this? 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
59 
MRS. HAMBURG: This was be
fore you had your hip opera
tion, so I would say this 
was...  
A: Did I have my  hip 
operation already? No?  
MRS. HAMBURG: No
. In the 80s.  
Q: In the 80s. 
A: The 80s, you think? 
Q: Okay . 
A: Somewheres around there, yes. 

MRS. HAMBURG: Late 80s.  
A: And she says why donâ„¢t yo
u go, I says I donâ„¢t want to 
have nothing to do with 
Germany, she says, look, this is already 
50 years ago and she said, you know, the people 
there are young people who don
â„¢t even know what the war 
looked like, they donâ„¢t even 
know what happened . Unfo rtun
ately, the school in Germany 
taught them very, very little, 
she says, go, maybe you can convince some of
 them what was for real. So I said, okay. 
So I brought my wife, we went there. We 
were 3 former refugees. One was, no four. 
Four, yeah. One was now living in  Argentina,
 one was living in Israel, it was a woman, 
one was living in Peru and I. 
And a funny th ing was Iâ„¢m chec
king in and I see there the 
four names of the people, the three names of
 the people, who are coming besides my self. 
I says, I canâ„¢t believe it. One of the names wa
s Eric Kaufmann. He was my  best friend in 
Germany. I said heâ„¢s still alive, he lives in 
Peru now and we met and I looked at him, he 
looked exactly like his 
father did 50 years ago. Bald with
 a black rim around it. I said I 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
60 
would know you if I met you in Chin a. So an
yway, th at was one thing, meeting him again 
was wonderful. And...  
Q: How did you feel 
being back there? 
A: I felt funny. Funny. The house where I lived
 in that my father 
owned with a beautiful, 
beautiful apartment we had was now a lake
. The house had been bomb ed. There was a 
big open lot next to it, I reme mb er that, and 
they had torn everything down and made like 
a big beau tiful lake, well Iâ„¢m saying lake like 
a square in America here, and flowers and 
trees and ducks in the 
pond. That was my then-home. A
nd my fatherâ„¢s business, which I 
had very vividly in front of 
my  eyes because I have it on
 a picture, too, was now a 
pharmacy. But more like a CVS,
 they were selling everythi
ng, you know, because in 
Germany, when  I was a kid, a pharmacy only 
sold th ings to make you better and mo st of 
it was herbs. So I felt bad, especially when I 
saw my  fatherâ„¢s store, the build ing behind it 
was still up there, but the part over the stor
e was taken down except behind there the 
apartments were still there. A
nd when I was invited by the ma
yor the second night we got 
dressed and the four of us w
ith our spouses went to meet 
the mayor. And I got there...  
Q: The ma yor of Mannheim?  

A: Ludwigshafen. 
Q: Ludwigshafen. 

A: Mannheim is only where I was born and wher
e I lived for the year before I went here. 
And Iâ„¢m coming in there and thereâ„¢s a whol
e bunch of people there because he was 
treating us to, that night we only had like coff
ee and cake right, yeah, it wasnâ„¢t a dinner 
like later. And I see there three fellows standing
 there and I look at them and I see them. I 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
61 
says, I bet you theyâ„¢re here fo
r me, and I went over there a
nd one says, Eric Hamburger, I 
knew it was you, I knew it was you and I knew
 you were the one 
with the thirteen. 
Whatâ„¢s the thirteen? Cute story.
 When  I was a kid going to sc
hool, if we ha
d any kind of 
things going in school any kind
 of tests, if it was on th e 13t
h, I knew I would get an A. I 
mean, I felt so confident, because I was bor
n on th e 13th of January, 1921. Now how did 
I come to the 13? I was once at my uncleâ„¢
s house in a little village and Iâ„¢m reading a 
magazine. I was sitting down a
nd I see there a story about Ri
chard Wagner, very famous 
musician, opera man, very German. And it sa
ys here, Richard Wager always thought of 
the number 13 as his lucky number. Why? 
Because he was born on the 13th, 18- 
whatever he was born in. The 13t
h he was born. His name had 13 letters. The year he was 
born, if you took the numb ers apart made 13.
 I says, very interesting. I said, wait a 
minute, I was born on th e 13th. My  name ha
s 13 letters, Eric Hamburger, and I was born 
in 1921, one and nine is 10 and two is 12 and 
one is 13. Hey, I got it made, 13, beautiful. 
Then when I told 
that in school, wh en I went back to school after vacation time, I says 13 
is my  number. I says I got another one. I was 
born in January, right? Whatâ„¢s the month 
before that? The 12th. So,  it 
could be the first or the 13th. And they  rememb ered that 
when I got there, youâ„¢re the one
 with the 13. And they invite
d me to their house and they  
took me out for dinner, nice 
people. Except when we went to
 the house of one guy, there 
was one fellow there and his wife came, who 
was very nice to me ex cept she was an 
idiot. Sheâ„¢s telling me that she was a nurse in
 a hospital in Theresienstadt. Thatâ„¢s all I 
needed. What else?  

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
62 
MRS. HAMBURG: No, I was referring to ho
w you spoke because they asked you to 
speak, to represent the group. 
A: Oh, oh, yeah. 
MRS. HAMBUR G: How you felt about it.  

A: Yeah, I opened my  big mouth. They  aske
d me, the ma yor asked me, he asked me, he 
says, you are welcome, he says, anybody here
 wants to say anything. And I said, yes, I 
do. He says, please, sp eak. And I told them, I 
says, I want to thank you fo r inviting me, I 
says, I never would have come back here if 
it wasnâ„¢t for the fact
 that you invited me, 
would have a chance to maybe straighten some things out that you have misconceptions 
for. I said, I can forgive you of what you did 
because itâ„¢s so long ago and th e people that 
are my age thereâ„¢s not that many around, I 
says, but I will never, never forget. I says, 
what you did to me and my  family, you stole 
my youth from me. I says, this was just the 
years that a young man has a good time, where he learns a trade, where he learns a 
busin ess, whatever it may be. You took th at 
away from me, I says, 
and I hope that you 
realize that this was horrible for me and my 
family. When we left there, we had a dinner 
and we were seated all around 
on a like a horseshoe table, was it? Or even a square. We 
werenâ„¢t seated next to each ot
her, they split us out. She was 
next to a young man who we 
had met the same day. He was in charge of the-- 

MRS. HAMBURG: Archives. 
A: Archives, of the town. And he
 found quite a few pictures of me, of my fatherâ„¢s store, 
before it was remodeled like it was now, and he
 was very nice. And he was sitting, at 
night now, sitting next to my wi
fe. I was sitting next to anothe
r man. We talked a bit, but 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
63 
we really had nothing mu ch to say to each ot
her. And again, the Burg
ermeister, which is 
the mayor, asked if anybody wanted to speak
. Yes, I do sir. Please. I said thank you 
again, I says, this was two very lovely week
s. I was able to go 
to Heidelberg, which I 
think is the prettiest little pl
ace in the world. Just gorgeous. 
I spent a lot of my youth there 
because we went practically every weekend.
 Up, on the car going 
up to the mountains 
and all that, you apparently havenâ„¢t been there.
 You? No. It is just beautiful, itâ„¢s a river 
going th rough it and itâ„¢s known as a university
 town. Some of the best doctors and 
lawyers were educated in He
idelberg. They also made an
 opera out of it called  theâ€“ 
MRS. HAMBURG: Student Prin ce. 
A: Student Prince. All takes pl
ace in this, I mean they donâ„¢
t mention Heidelberg there, I 
donâ„¢t think, but, I mean, that was the.. 
MRS. HAMBURG: Locale. 

A: What happened th ere in Heidelberg. And, 
wait a minute, yeah, all right, I says I saw 
my Heidelberg again that Iâ„¢ll always love 
an d thereâ„¢s nothing to do with anything th at 
Hitler had to do. I says, the river, the Neckar,I says, I can still sing the song Ich hab mein 
Hertz in Heidelberg verloren, 
I lost my heart in Heidelberg
. And I says, but I must tell 
you, itâ„¢s very hard, very hard  for me to 
look around and see people 
that havenâ„¢t got the 
slightest idea of what the Jewish popula
tion went thro ugh. I said I had a funny 
experience, I says, I saw H
itler with my own eyes. I sa
ys, when he was here in 
Ludwigshafen, when he went 
through there. I didnâ„¢t tell 
them I was s
itting on top of 
_______. I said, and you peop
le think you know that he was somebody that you, der 
Fuhrer. I says, he cost you a lot of people. 
I says, I want to tell you one thing and th atâ„¢s 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
64 
the end of what Iâ„¢m saying. I 
cry. I cry for the six million 
Jews that you killed. In the 
ovens, in any way possi
bly, you kill them, not only that
, you killed five million other 
people. Gypsies. Priests. Gay people. Anyb
ody th at was a Commu nist. Five mi llion other 
people that werenâ„¢t Jews. I says, I cry for 
them. And last but not least, I cry for the 
millions of people that you lost in this 
war. Some of the best people and I know it 
because they were all my friends. So cry fo
r them with me. And they said that was 
beautiful. But then the fellow s
itting next to her said what? 

MRS. HAMBURG: This is 
an interesting story. 
A: Say it louder. 
Q: Weâ„¢re not going to get it 
recorded, so we sh
ould, if you want 
to come closer. 
MRS. HAMBURG: Okay . Th
is archives director. 
A: Wait a minute. You want to take over for me? Take over.  
Q: Thatâ„¢s okay. Do  you rememb er
 what he said? Can you tell me? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay . 

A: This fellow sitting next to 
her, when he heard that I had seen Hitler in person, he was 
in awe. Your husband saw H
itler? Do you realize what th
at means? Your husband saw 
Hitler, really? And she looked at him like he 
was from another planet, he had no idea.  
MRS. HAMBURG:  But th
e important thing, he was telli
ng us his father was pastor. And 
he said that he saw in the books he used 
for his sermon, where he would underline certain 
things which subtly criticized the Nazi regime. Implying that his father was one of the 

liberals who tried. And he was very respectful
 to us and very, seemed, very liberal. And 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
65 
when he carried on so 
because Eric saw Hitler, it was su ch 
a conflict there that he didnâ„¢t 
realize. It struck me. 
It just struck me.  
Q: Certainly. 
A: I want you to know that in 
my class, my high school class,
  there were 50 boys. Except 
for myself, another kid who was from Polish 
immigrants, not Jewish, all were in  the 

army. Out of the 50 boys, 28 were killed. This
 is what they have to
 worry about, thatâ„¢s 
why I said I cry for them, there was nothing 
wrong with them except wh at you people 
made out of them.  

Q: Well, I think that concludes--  
A: Thatâ„¢s enough? 
Q: Yeah, is there anything else you want to a
dd, just at the end? Final thoughts on your 
life and your experience?  

A: I have th ree children. Beautiful children. 
I had a daughter, Marcy.
 I had a son David, 
and a son Michael. Marcy is gone.
 She died of cancer at 55 
years old. Sh e was gorgeous. 
Have you got the picture here of the family? 
Iâ„¢ll put it in there. You have my  passport?  
Q: Iâ„¢d like to look at your photos when  weâ„¢re
 done. Is that it? I guess my  final question 
would be, how and would 
you, per se, would you 
have been a different person if this had 
not happened, if the Holo
caust had never happened ? 
A: Different in what sense? Different was, 
numb er one, I would have been a very rich 
young man taken over my  fatherâ„¢s business.
 Different that I would have married a 
German-Jewish girl. Different that my w
hole life was completely different. I mean, 
America is not Germany and Ge
rmany certainly is not America. The freedom that I have 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
66 
in this country, I didnâ„¢t have
 over there even be
fore Hitler. And I remember my father on 
Rosh  Hashanah going to temp le
 in tails and a high hat. Th
is was the common thing for a 
high holiday . I used to go to  shul every Satu rd
ay morning. I havenâ„¢t 
been to sh ul now in 
God knows how long, but that 
is because my  daughter died
. And on Saturday  afternoon 
after we went home to have lunch or someth
ing, we went back an d had a youth service. 
We ate strictly kosher. I remember one time 
for Pesach, I was out and I saw a man who 
was selling ice cream and I bought my self an 
ice cream cone and I had it half finished 
and I realized this is not kosher lâ„¢Pesach. 
I threw it away. Thereâ„¢s a lot of things that 
would have been entirely differe
nt. Entirely different. A little girl that I was going with 
when  I left was killed in Auschwitz. And 
why was she killed? Let me tell you this. Her 
father was in World War I, like my father, he had relatives in  America, they sent him an 

affidavit for him, his wife, and my girlfriend.
 No other children. Th
ey  went to Frankfurt 
to the consulate and they examine them there 
and they noticed that 
this part, this little 
part was mi ssing on his finger. And they said, wh
atâ„¢s this? He says, oh, this is a souvenir 
from World War I, I got my little finger shot
 off, itâ„¢s nothing. You say itâ„¢s nothing, I 
donâ„¢t see it here on th e affidavit that your pe
ople here in America know youâ„¢re missing a 
finger. Iâ„¢m not missing a finger. Well, I canâ„¢t 
give you the visa. He, his wife, and my  
girlfriend died. Because of this idiot at an American consulate. Itâ„¢s 
so sad when you think 
about things. I lost my aunt, 
she was left there because she had diab etes they wouldnâ„¢t 
give her a visa. I lost my cousin there beca
use he had, what the 
heck was it, epilepsy. 
They  wouldnâ„¢t give him a visa
. And I know how they  died
. I donâ„¢t know if you know 
that, they used to have these big, like a train 
thing and thatâ„¢s what th
ey put these people in 

Interview with Eric J. Hamberg  
67 
and they  gave them something to eat, and 
there was a car outside and it had a hose 
attached to the train thing, a
nd then they put in 
the gas. Thatâ„¢s how these people died, 
they werenâ„¢t even at a concentr
ation camp. But I am here and Iâ„¢m ready to tell my story.  
Q: Well, thank you so mu ch 
for sharing your story--  
A: You know I always felt bad because a lot 
of my  friends who never ever saw what I 
see, who never went to any wars like I did, th
ey were on, whatâ„¢s it called? Whatâ„¢s the day 
that we remember the Holocaust? 
Q: Yom Hashoah. 

A: Yom Hashoah. They were up on the stag
e telling their story and they never asked me. 
And then  finally, last, two years ago th ere was 
an article in the Jewi
sh News because they 
wanted to  straighten it out. A lo t of people 
say if you havenâ„¢t been
 in the concentration 
camp, youâ„¢re not a Holocaust survivor and I 
said it is wrong. An
ybody th at survived 
Kristalnacht is a Holocau
st survivor. Iâ„¢m one.  
Q: Well, thank you so mu ch, so mu ch
, and letâ„¢s stop here and I would--  
A: I hope you got something out of it.  

Q: So much, really. So
, so much and I would just say for our tape-- 
A: Did you find the picture?  

Q: This concludes the United 
States Holocaust memorial in
terview with Eric Hamburg.
