for  about 45 m inutes .  If we have time at the end of the pr ogram, we will have an 
opportunity for you to ask  Dor a a few questions
. A n
d we've prepared a brief s lide pres e

with her introduction. 
 
 
This  is Dora, bor n Teodor a Bas c h in 1938 in Zagreb, what was  then Yugos lavia.
 
 
Her e we s ee Dora on a park benc h with her  younger br other, Zdr avko. 
 
 
On this  map of Yugos lavia, in 1933, the arr ow points  to Zagr eb and where s he lived. 
 
 
In this  photo we s ee Dora on an outing to the zoo
 
with her parents, S
alamon
 
and 
S ilva
.  
Salam on ran a brus h

Pic tured here is D
or a
's  gr andfather, Rabbi J os ef Leopold Deuts c h.  When s he was  vis iting in 
this  small town of Ludbreg, Germ any invaded Yugos lavia.  Ludbreg bec ame part of a public  s tate run 
by the fas hionis ts . 
 
 
In 1941 in J une, Dor a's parents and her  brother  were ar r ested.  Their house
keeper  got baby 
Zdr avko out of pris on and fr om then on Dora and Zdr avko wer e s helter ed by their  mother 's s is ter  Giza

a
nd her hus band Ljudevit.  On the left you s ee Giza and on the right is  Ljudevit.  The photo of Ljudevit 
was  taken m any year s  af
ter this  one fr om Giza. 
 
 
Later in the war Aunt Giza was  denounc ed and s ent to Aus c hwitz wher e s he per is hed.  Dor a 
r em ained in Yugos lavia in 1957 when s he em igr ated to the United States .
 
 
We c los e with this  portr ait of Aunt Giza, Dora and Zdravko s ent to be taken to Ljudevit in the 
c onc entration c am p wher e he had been s ent. 
 
 
In 1957, long after  the war , as  Dora was  on her way to Switzer land, s he met Daniel Klayman 
r eturning to New Yor k  fr om a year  of post
-
doctoral s tudy as a Fulbright s
c holar in India.  Th
ey were 
m arried in Switzer land a year later .  Together  they ar rived in the United States  in the fall of 1958.
 
 
By the following year, Dan and Dor a c am e toWashington, D.C. and Dan em barked on a 
c ar eer as  a r es ear c her  in medicinal chem istry, the Walter  Reed
 
A rm y 
I

was  in the developments agains t malar ia.
  
Dora res umed her educ ation, getting degrees in Frenc h and 
Englis h as a s ec ond language.  She taught in Montgom ery County, Mar yland, public  s c hools, inc luding 
23 year s  at Bethes da Chev y Chas e 
High S

Dan pas s ed away in 1992.  Both of their childr en live in 
the Was hington area.  Wanda is

So s he's been with us a really long time.  Her work  her e c ons is ts  pr imarily of trans lating mater ials  from  

the Holoc aus t wr itten in Croatian, Bos nian, and Serbian.  Her ongoing projec t is c onnec ted to the 
J as enovac  ar c hives , a conc entration c amp in Croatia.  As  we will hear  later, it was  a m ajor c am p that 

had 
to
 
do a gr eat deal with her  life.
  
Other projects  for Dor a inc luded trans lation of a booklet that 
ac c ompanied a 1942 anti
-
Semitic  exhibit in Cr oatia and then tr ans lation of the c aptions  on a large 
ar c hive of photogr aphs that have been gathered dur ing the Pos twar two trials  in Yugos lavia.
 
 
Dor a enjoys  tr aveling.  She's  been to Is r ael s everal tim es and is about to go ther e again.  Ar e 
you going again?  You jus t c am e back.  Som e of her
 
tr avels  ar e c onnected to learning m or e about the 
events  and the after math of the Holoc aus t.  She has  attended s ever al c onfer enc es  in the I
nter national 
Organization of Child Sur vivor s , been to Poland, vis ited Aus c hwitz.  She traveled to her for mer  hom e in 

Croatia.  And during that tr ip s he ac c ompanied
 
the Dir ec tor  of the J as enovac  ar c hive to the s ite of the 
c onc entration c am p to view the c urr ent exhibit.
  
To add to her  language sk ills , Dora c ontinues  to lear n 
Hebrew.
 
 
With that, I'd like you join me in welcom ing our

[Applaus e]
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  T
hank  you s o muc h, Dor a for  joining.  You wer e bor n in 1938.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  So you were 3 year s  old when WorldWar II c am e into Yugos lavia in the s pring of 

1941.
  
It was  attacked then by Germany.  So befor e we tur n to the hor ror s  of the war and the 
Holoc aus t, why don't you tell us a little about your  par ents, what you remem ber about your  life befor e.  

Who wer e they? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an: Well, as  in the photogr aph, my m other and father  wer e liv ing in Zagreb at the time I 

was  born.  That's  wher e I was  bor n.  It's  only m y father that lived ac tually before their m arr iage in 
Zagreb.  It was  a fair ly r eligious  fam ily.  There were s ix s iblings
, t
hree br others  and three s ist
er s.  
Ever ybody was  at that point working at one thing or another
 b
efor e the war . 
 
 
The family
 
--
 
I never really got to know that family ver y well befor e the war.  I don't have a 
great m emory of them.  And s om e of them, of c our s e, per is hed in the war .  We'
ll talk about that.
 
 
My m other's family I got to know eventually better bec aus e I ended up in Ludbr eg eventually.  
They had lived in that town for a long tim e.  My grandfather was  a rabbi of this  s mall town in the north of 
Croatia.  The fam ily c ame or iginally fr om  Slovakia.  When my gr andfather c ame, the fam ily alr eady had 

two c hildren.  They wer e teenager s.  And then they had two m or e c hildr en, inc luding m y mother.
 

3 
 
My gr andfather was  the only rabbi of that town.  It was  a sm all J ewis h population.
 
> > Lynn W
illiam s:  And bac k  in Zagreb, your father
, 
what did he do?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  My father had started a sm all fac tor y.  It was  a wor ks hop.  It gr ew fairly well.  He 
owned and oper ated this works hop, sm all fac tory of brus hes .  They manufac tur ed brus hes .  It was  an 
organization that appar ently was  doing reas onably well.  I have photographs .  Som e of them I think  are 
online.  There are m any m or e photogr aphs  than we jus t s aw online at the Holoc aus t 
M
us eum.  There 
were about a dozen wor k m en.  The family was  doing w
ell.
 
 
My m other was  not teaching at the point of whic h I was  born.  She had taught for s everal 
year s  while.  Left, my br other was  born.  She had taught for  s everal year s in Ludbr eg.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Let's  br ing us  to the war per iod.  Zagr eb is  attacked. 
 
Yugos lavia is  attacked.  Where 
were you?
 

> > Dora Klaym an:  J us t before Apr il
 
6, 1941, whic h was  the day that Yugos lavia was  attacked, ther e 
were neighbor s of my grandparents vis iting in Zagreb.  I was  s ent with them  to m y grandparents.  I'm  

s till not c lea
r  to this  day
 
--
 
and, of c ours e, I will never  know
 
--
 
whether m y par ents had me bec aus e they 
had a s ens e that the war  was  c om ing or  the fac t that m y brother  at that time was  9 m onths  old and it 

was  an opportunity to s end m e.  So at the age of 3, with neighbor s, m y grandparents' neighbors , I was  
s ent to Ludbr eg and that was  the last time I s aw m y par ents . 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Do you r emember or k now if they made an attem pt to get out of Zagr eb?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  They m ade no attempt to get out of Zagr eb, ac tu
ally, that I know of.  The war  c ame 

s o s uddenly.  I think there was  a s ens e, I think  in Yugos lavia befor e the war .  I, of c ours e, was  too 
young to unders tand.  But I know that ther e was  a s ens e that the war  was  c oming but ther e was  r eally 
no plac e muc h to 
go.
 
 
Ac tually, s om e of the family, at one point but not m y parents, ended up going to the Italian 
zone.  Germ any had oc cupied the northern part
 
--
 
Germ any had oc c upied really m uc h of Yugos lavia 
but Cr oatia, as  I think you m entioned, was r eally r un by Us tasa, the Nazi puppet gover nm ent, a 
gover nm ent that r an ever ything in ac c ord with the Ger mans .  In other wor ds , they ac c epted all the laws  
r un by Germ any that had to do with pers ec ution of J ews , Rom a, etc ., but they als o had their own 
agenda of pers ec uting Ser bs .  They r an the northern part of Croatia, the lar ger part of Cr oatia.  But the 

c oas t was  oc c upied by Italy.  The Italian zone was  m uc h s afer and s o many people had tried to esc ape 
into that part.  Some par t of m y fam ily from  Ludbreg, m y m other's  s ister and her family, did try.  They 
ac tually went and then they retur ned bec aus e they wer e prom is ed safety.  But m y par ents were 
ar r ested s o fas t after the beginning of the war  that there was  no question of any point of es c aping. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Even though
 
it went down to the southern part, r ight, whic h is  r eally beautiful down 
ther e als o.  I've been in that ar ea.  It's  beautiful.  They wer e c onvinc ed to c om e back home.
 
> > Dora Klaym an: Well, yes .  I think  ther e was  a c omplete dis belief into what was  r eall
y going to 
happen.  And, of c ours e, ther e was  a pr oc lam ation that they would be s afe if they r etur ned.  But very 

few people did that.  In fac t, people fr om  the town of Ludbreg that wer e friends  of the fam ily fortunately 
did not r etur n.  They stayed in the Italian zone.  And as  the war developed, they had to do other things.  

They were res c ued by the partis ans  into the m ountains .  Some of them were tr ansferr ed to Italy as Italy 
c apitulated.
 
 
B as ic ally
 
--
 
s o this  one fam ily r etur ned.  And they're s till good f
r iends of m ine. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  That's good.
 
 
Getting back  to you.  Now you'r e out of Zagreb.  You're in Ludbr eg.  How did your  aunt and 
unc le know that your  parents  had been taken?  Did they know? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  We hear d
 
--
 
I don't know by w
hat m eans .  There wer e telephones , of c ours e 
not in gr eat us e but s till.  So they wer e told that this  had happened.
  
I have s om e mem or ies  of 
ever ybody c rying, being told that things wer e bad but not exac tly
 
what had happened.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Your little
 
br other als o
 
--
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  My 9
-
m onth
-
old br other was  taken into c us tody, was  depor ted by the Ustas a into an 
infam ous holding plac e in Zagreb.  The hous ek eeper  of our s
 
telephoned.  My Aunt Giza, m y m other's 
s is ter, and her hus band were able to go and get him from her.  She was  able to
 
--
 
they handed m y 

4 
 
br other to the hous ek eeper .  And then she handed the baby to my aunt and unc le.
  
I have a m emory of 
his  ar riving, m os tly bec aus e all of a s udden we were in my gr andpar ents' hous e and there was  all of 
a 
s udden this c r ying baby.  I was  a 3
-
year
-
old like, what is  this?  [Laughter] 
 
So I have s ort of that 
m em or y in my head.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Of your br other  cr ying.
 
 
So in 
`
42, then your  unc le was  arr ested.  Right? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  No.  In 
`
42 everybody was  ar res ted but not this unc le.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Not that unc le?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  No.  In 
`
42, things were really getting bad.  By 
`
42, the entire J ewis h population of 
Ludbreg was  arr es ted.  So I need to explain about m y Aunt Giza and 
U
ncle Ljudevit who were in the 
pic ture.  Giza was  15 year s  older than m y m other.  So bas ic ally the r elations hip was  almos t like, you 
know, alm ost brought her  up s ort of. 
 
She was  s ort of the oldest daughter.  She had been in love for a 
very long time with Ljudevit, whom pic ture we als o s aw.  But they c ame from ver y differ ent fam ilies .  He 

was  a m em ber  of a ver y old, Catholic  Ludbr eg fam ily.  They were minor
 
aristocrats. H
e was a bank  
dir ec tor.  She worked in the bank.  So this is  how they m et.  Not that it was  diffic ult to m eet in a very 

s m all town.  But they had a c los e relations hip.  
 
 
They were in love for ver y m any year s .  Ludbr eg was  a plac e in whic h ther e was  a gr eat deal 
of integr ation.  Not into marriage, just s oc ial integration.  My gr andfather , for  exam ple, s er ved 
as a 

teac her of religion, as  a tr ans lator and s o on, even in the public  s c hool and in c ourts.  The J ewis h 
population was  fair ly m inor .  It was  pr os per ous .  There were no pr oblem s of any kind of r iots or 
anything like that whic h k ind of r em ember  was  happening in m any plac e
s 
in Eas ter n Europe but not 
her e.  J ews  were fair ly late in c om ing to this  par t of the wor ld.  And generally ther e was  not m uc h 

animos ity.
  
So in this  atmos pher e, s till interm ar r iage was  not the thing.  
 
 
So they had been in love for  a ver y
 
long tim e.  He was  10 year s  older than s he.  They waited 
and waited.  And then by
 
--
 
> > LynnWilliams:  A long time?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  For many years .  By the tim e war was  about to start, they m arried.  You 

c ould not mar ry in Yugoslav ia at that ti
m
e 
in 
a c ivil c er em ony.  And neither  of them was  conver ting.  So 
they ac tually had to go to Hungar y whic h had c ivil c eremony and they wer e marr ied in Hungar y.
 
 
So by the tim e this  whole war  had started and my br other was  alr eady there, 1942 c ame, and 
ever yb
ody was  getting arr es ted and deported in Ludbr eg.  People who were not getting deported was  
this  aunt of m ine who was  marr ied to the Catholic  unc le.  Bec ause at that point intermar riages
 
--
 
people 
who were intermar r ied wer e not s ubject to the depor tation.
 
 
So I have very viv id m emor y of that night when ever ybody was  being depor ted.  Bec aus e all 
of a s udden ther e was  my brother, who was  now older , and I
, i
t was  1942
, e
verybody was  c rying and 
c ar r ying s uitc as es, pillows , s aying goodbye.  I did not have a sense of why. Why was  everybody 
s aying goodbye?  They wer e depor ted.  And they were deported to Jas enovac , the infam ous  
c onc entration c am p.
  
And the ques tion often c omes  why not m e.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Yes .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  To this  day I don't exac tly know.  My thought is that we wer e not
 
--
 
bec aus e we 
were from Zagreb not fr om  Ludbr eg we wer e not offic ially on the lis t of J ews  from that town.  And the 
people who c ame and did the arr es ting and did the deporting were not people from  that town.
  
Ever ybody in that town k new who we were.  It was  s ort of like a c ounty s eat.  Imagine that the one r abbi 

and the rabbi's grandc hildr en.  Of c ourse ever ybody knew who we were.  Whoever  c am e to do the 
deporting, they would go thr ough the lis t.  Ever ybody had to regis ter lon
g befor e.  People had to wear 
the yellow s tars.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  And you didn't wear them.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I didn't r em em ber  having one.  I owned one.  I ac tually donated it to the m us eum .  
But I don't r em em ber  how that played out.
 

5 
 
 
We had to declare our property.  I do have c opies of this  paperwork  wher e everybody was  
dec lar ing what they owned s o that they knew who ever ybody was  when they c am e to gather the entir e 
J ewis h population and ever ybody was  gone.
 
 
So we wer e left now with this  Catholic  unc le and his  wife, m y Aunt Giza.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Did things  s tay pr etty s afe in Ludbreg?  What was  life like then for  you as they came 

for both your unc les  and Giza?  How long did things r em ain?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  For a while things  were stable
 
but 
--
 
actuall
y, in term s of being depor ted.  But what 
was  happening around Ludbreg is  it's an area whic h is  c los e to the beginning of the hill, hilly ar ea, 

m ountains.  At the point we are, early 1940's, ther e has been a s izeable gather ing of par tis ans.  
Partis ans  wer e bas ic ally people who did not want
 
--
 
young people who didn't want to s er ve in the Ar my, 
did not want to go along with the r egime.  They es c aped in the m ountains and they s lowly form ed units , 
fighting units.  The partisans  wer e led by the Comm unis t Par ty whic h, of c our s e, later on form ed the 
Yugoslav government.  So I think m any people ar e familiar with the nam e of Tito, who was  the head of 
the m ovem ent.  But on the loc al level we didn't have that s ens e. We had only the s ens e that thes e 
were people who wer e
 
fighting and fighting the loc al
 
--
 
the Us tas a, the Nazi puppet gover nm ent.
 
 
At one point m y unc le got ar r ested.  I'm s orr y.  I have to go back a little bit to explain why he 
was  ar res ted. 
 
He was  arr es ted at one point bec aus e he was  ac c us ed of collabor ating with the 
par tis ans.  Whic h I'm s ure he did but that's not exac tly
 
--
 
but, you know.
 
 
One of the things  that happened is  they took a number of people who were s ort of heading the 
gover nm ent of the town or were a pr om inent c itiz en in s ome way.  They arr ested m y unc le, who was  
the 
d
ir ector of the bank , and the pers on who ran the hotel, bookstore, or  whatever .  Bec aus e they wer e 
politic al pris oner s , differently from  J ews  or Serbs or Roma who wer e just sent to c am ps and 

annihilated
; 
bas ic ally, thes e people wer e actually  given s entenc es.  So he was  given a sentenc e and 
s ent to Jas enovac .
 
> > LynnWilliams:  He was  s ent to J as enovac .  Did he s ee anybody there?
 

> > Dora Klaym an:  He eventually r etur ned.  He did s ee my father.  My m other  m us t have already 
per is hed.
 
 
J as enovac was  an inc redibly br utal c am p.  I think  most people haven't hear d of it
. W
e are 
foc us ing on
 
--
 
in lear ning about the Holoc aus t we foc us  on the large c am ps  in Poland, Aus c hwitz,
 
Ber
gen
-
Bels en, etc.  J asenovac  was  s m aller  but it was  one of the most brutal c amps there was .  It was  
r un in a les s  organized fas hion than the ones  in Germ any and Poland s o that people wer e killed ever y 

whic h way s ometimes.  
 
 
I was  told by witnes s es  that m y grandfather, who was  fairly elderly alr eady  at that point, was  
ki
lled.  He c ouldn't even get into the c amp.  He was  s till on the outs ide and they jus t killed him with a 
s hovel.  So it was  a place where people wer e killed with farm implem ents  and knives  and s o on and 
thrown into the river .  Ther e was  a river  near by.
 
 
Int
eres tingly enough
 
--
 
r ec ently there was  a m ovie out c alled "The 
W
oman in 
G
old."  I'm s ure 
people s aw it.  Ther e's  a book  that prec eded the movie.  I jus t read it.  Even though it foc us es on 
Aus tria, one part of the fam ily went to Yugos lavia and ther e is  a des c r iption of J as enovac  in a few 
pages.  It's  the fir s t time I've s een any books publis hed in Americ a that are ac tually
 
--
 
yeah, talk about 
that.

s 
it's  not r eally s afe in Ludbr eg.  Ther e is  this  fighting going on. We'r e in the m iddle of a war .  So how did 

that effec t your life?  Life c ouldn't have been norm al.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  No, definitely not.  It
 
was  m ainly
 
--
 
the problem was  t
he fact that ther e was  this  
fighting going on.  We often s pent tim e in the basement but the bas em ent was  not an Americ an
-
type 
bas ement.  It was  a wine c ellar . We had a vineyar d, a small vineyard.  Ther e were barrels  of
 
wine 
down there.  It was  dir t floor.  The hous e was  built in 1800s by my unc le's  par ents.  It was  thick  walls 

but the dirt floor, fr ogs jum ping ar ound.  But we s pent time s leeping on c ots  in the c ellar  for quite a bit of 
tim e bec aus e the fighting was  going on around us and you never know what would happe
n.

Then at the end of fighting, we would peer  out.  Som etim es  the par tis ans, in fact, won.  There 
were two tim es  that we were ac tually liber ated for  a few
 
--
 
for  a s hor t per iod of time.  But the r es t of the 
tim e the Ustas a were ther e.
  
 
 
The fighting was 
often very s ever e.

--
 
m y unc le was  s till 
ther e.  I have a memor y of not having had the time to r un into the c ellar.  We wer e stuck in our hous e in 
the living room , crouc hing in a c or ner.  And the r eas on I r emember m y uncle was  there is bec aus e I 
c alled him bec aus e I was  c rying.  He had c ome from another room.  A bullet 
p
ier c ed thr ough the 
window and str aight into where he had been.  But he had c om e to see me. We were s or t of like in 

cr oss-
fi
r e.  At one point Us tas a were in our  backyar d
; 
the hous e ac r oss  had been occupied by the 
par tis ans.  So they wer e just s hooting at one another
 w
hile we were in the c ros s
-
fir e.  And the bullets  
were c om ing in through the windows .  Afterwar ds

we
 
had this  
armoire --

-
in c los ets  but 
ar m oire m ade of ver y beautiful wood whic h was  
p
ier c ed by bullets .  You could take a table c loth out 
and it had s ort of like when c hildr en take a napkin and you mak e
 
--
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Make designs . 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  That's  what the table c loth and s heets looked like.  It was , of c our s e, ver y 

fr ightening.  It's amazing how c hildr en c om pens ate.  It's frightening and you don't know why it's  
happening.  And then you just go on.  Look how the fr ogs  are jum ping.

,  
what do childr en play after wards ? We played 
war a lot with c or n s talks.
  
Any way, that was  s ort of life in Ludbr eg.

ar r ested.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  He got ar rested.

s he's  going to be on her own, no protection.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Right.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So often he would have to leave town.  We left town
 
--
 
we wer e ver y for tunate that 
we wer e in a town where people would s ometimes  warn us  that s om ething would happen.
  
I r em ember 
leav ing by train and going to a nearby town and then r etur ning and not exac tly knowing
 
--
 
in r etrospec t I 
know but I didn't know at that time it was  danger ous .  We'll c om e right back .  Not to wor r y.  Always  not 
to wor ry. 
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  So
 
you're fighting bullets and dodging s elections .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Exac tly.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  At one point is Giza taken? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  At one point, unfor tunately, befor e he returned, s omeone who was  not from that 

town but who
 
--
 
was  from  like one of the s ur rounding villages
 
--
 w
e found out later  on who it was , 
pointed out to the Ustas a who wer e retur ning the plac e at the tim e that there was  this  J ewis h wom an in 

this  hous e.  They c ame and got her.  She tr ied to run and hide.  But it was  im pos s ible.  They c aught 

her .
 
 
What about us ?  Well, as I just desc ribed the house that we lived in, ther e was  a building right 
next to it.  That building had been started by my two aunts , m y aunt Giza, about whom  we ar e 
s peaking
, and the other  one who at one point tried to go to Italy but was  later deported.  Thos e two 
families  s tar ted building.  Ther e was  a s tore on the gr ound floor and an apartment in the back .  And this  

apar tm ent in the back  was  r ented to a fam ily by the name of Runjak .  They had thr ee teenage c hild
ren.

> > LynnWilliam s:  A Catholic  family?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  A Catholic  family.  Everybody ther e is  Catholic .  Bas ic ally a Catholic  wor ld. 
 
My aunt, I'm  told by the Runjak fam ily
 
--
 
one of the daughter s  is s till alive.  She s aid that m y aunt said, 
you know
, pleas e take care of thes e childr en.  And s he just left the c hildr en with this  family.
  
She was  
then deported.  She was  depor ted to Aus c hwitz.  We k now that.  At that point they were s tarting to 
deport people from Aus chwitz fr om Cr oatia whic h didn't happen earlier .  And we know that bec ause I 

ac tually
 
--
 
in the m us eum  we have doc umentation that s he was  in Aus c hwitz and s he died ther e.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  And you didn't find that out until muc h later.  Right?
 
> > Dora Klaym an: We always  s us pec ted that s he went to Aus c hwitz but we never  r eally knew until just 
r ec ently, after  the doc umentation c ame her e. 
 
 
In the m eantim e, m y uncle had c ome back  fr om Jas enovac
 t
elling us about the hor r ific 
c onditions  ther e but not until what he did firs t, tr ied to find his wife.  So he followed the tr ail, tried to find 

wher e s he had gone.  We wer e s till s taying with the Runjak  family.
 
 
Us tasa were big in our  bac kyard s o it was  dangerous .  We had learned to s ay "Mother " to 
Mr s .
 
Runjak and m y br other who was  younger  always  c alled 
her m other for  the res t of the time.  I knew 
to c all her  m other  when Us tas a wer e ar ound and when they wer e not ar ound I would revert to c alling 

her  Mrs .
 
Runjak.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  That's hard. 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So my unc le, unfortunately, was  not s uc c essf
ul.  He returned.  At that time, also, 
ther e was  a poss ibility that s omeone els e would point us  out.  So appar ently the loc al pr iest had s poken 

with Mr s .
 
Runjak  and s aid to her, and I'm quoting her  daughter, s aid to her, "What are we going to do 
about thes
e c hildren?"  Like, you know, they ar e going to be next.  So they thought if we get baptized 
that m ight s ave us.  So we wer e baptized.
 
 
My unc le told us  a lot of awful s tor ies  about J as enovac .  One of the things that we did that 
was  very unus ual in a s ens e, we wer e allowed to s end packages, even while he was  s till ther e.  We 

were allowed to s end pac kages . We made m ixtures  of fat and flour and made like br ick  c akes out of it.  
That's what we would s end bec aus e they wer e bas ic ally getting nothing but water a
s  s oup.  So they 
would take this  and they would, you know, put it ins ide to m ake s ome c alories .  
 
 
He told us
 
--
 
he told s tor ies , many of thes e stor ies I didn't hear until later .  And the r eas on he 
was  able to s ur vive rather than my father who eventually
 - -  
m y mother who died I think  very early, is  
that
 
--
 
he was  a violinis t by avoc ation.  He had been ver y ac tive in the c omm unity r unning a c hoir, 
putting on perform anc es, having a little orc hes tra.  And in the c am p the Us tas a wanted to have 
entertainm ent and
 
s o he organized s hows , a c hoir whic h allowed him  to tak e s om e people fr om the 
pr is on c omm unity and have them have an hour wher e ins tead of working har d, c ar rying bricks, making 
c hains , whatever they wer e doing, they were able to s ing.  The other way  he s ur vived was they knew 
he was  a banker and they needed to have s om ebody wor king in their office.  They put him  ther e.  
Other wis e he might not have s ur vived either .  Becaus e he was  already older.  He had never  been in 
good health.  So that m ight have really been very diffic ult for him.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  So he c ame back  though.  He's  los t his  wife.  He's  got the two of you.  And now 
you're really rais ed in a Catholic  envir onment, a Catholic  home.
 
> > Dora Klaym an: We were r ais ed in a Catholic  envir onment. What is  happening at that point
 
--
 
we 
ar e still in the situation in whic h we s ort of have to pretend as to who we are.  We have to watc h wher e 
we go.
  
One of the things that was  partic ularly diffic ult som etimes  is both my br other and I had flaming 
r ed hair, whic h is  not ther e anymore.  [Laughter ] 
 
It's  fairly unus ual, quite unus ual, in Croatia.  People 
ar e not r edheads.  So going outs ide when ther e was  anybody that didn't know who we are m ight s top 

us  to s ee just who we are.  
 
 
There was  a tim e that the head of the Ustas a c ame to vis it.  He was  the big to do in town.  I 
very muc h wanted to go with all the other c hildren.  But I was  not allowed to go.  I r em em ber  that I was  
told if I want to peer  out the fenc e, I was  to wear a hat on m y head s o that I would not be notic eable 
even in the middle of the s ummer.  Bec aus e I would be an unus ual
-
looking c hild.
  
So things wer e sor t 
of tens e. We lived through all of thes e battles .  After  the battles would go outs ide.

I rem ember
 
--
 
bec aus e my unc le c ould not take c ar e 
of us on a daily bas is , we had maids  who 
would do the c ooking.  Ther e were farm  women who c am e to tak e car e of things.  I r em em ber one of 
them taking me onc e to take a look
 
--
 
I think we wer e to go to a m ovie or something
.  On
 
the m ain 
s quare
 
--
 
it was aft
er a battle and the Us tas a had won.  And on the m ain squar e ther e were trees  on 
ever y s quar e.  And from  ever y tr ee ther e was  a partis an hanging. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  She took  you 
to 
s ee this ? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I think s he tr ied not 
to 
have me s ee it.  Bec aus e I rem em ber very m uc h that s he 
was  holding her hands  on my eyes  and I ver y m uc h wanted to s ee it.  So I do have that image in my 
head.  She did not s hield me s uc c essfully.  I think s he pr obably wanted to see it.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  It's am azing to m e thi
s  sm all town, Ludbreg, with all of thes e people, now the J ews  
have been mainly depor ted.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  All of them.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  But they all s helter ed the two of you.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  And the town is  not ver y big.
 
>> 
Dora Klayman:  No.  The town is  ver y s mall, ac tually.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Ver y s mall.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  A c ouple of thous and people.  And then a lot of small villages  all ar ound.  It's all 

farm land.  Whic h in a way, the fact that it was  all far mland saved us  to s ome extent dur ing the war in 
that we did not starve at any point.  Bec aus e people
 
--
 
ever ybody, you know, c ould gr ow at least their 
fr uits and vegetables.  So we always  had 
--
 
in wintertim e we s till have things like potatoes and c abbage
 
s
o that the f
ood may not have been exc ellent but it was  food.  At 
no
 
point
 
did we s uffer like s om e areas 
in the more m ountainous ar ea where people didn't gr ow their own food.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  So May
 
1945.  It's the end of the war.  It's you, your  brother, and your  un
c le.  Tell 
m e what was  war's  end like? What do 
you 
r em em ber about the ending of the war in Ludbreg?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  J us t relief that it was  all happy  and good.  We wer e safe.  No m or e battles .  But now 

I have a mem or y of a c olum n of Ustas a being dr iven through Ludbr eg looking bedr aggled, exhaus ted, 
not fed, having little water
; p
eople jus t s tanding and looking.  And here and there s omebody would give 
t
hem s omething and they were 
told not to.
 
 
Of c ours e, at that time I didn't quite unders tand it but I know now that it was  the las t of the 
Us tasa that wer e
 
--
 
that had been c aught by the partis ans and now they wer e pris oners  of war .  They 
were marc hed
, w
hatever  happened to them after  the war
.  Ther e wer e also trials .  I 
remem ber those. 
 
> > Lynn William s:  
And they wer e r unning. Where were they r unning to?  As they es c aped, where was  
Us tasa going?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  They wer e tr ying to run
 
--
 
the las t c olum ns  were tr ying to go to Austria.  They tried 
to go to the Britis h zone.
 
> > Lynn Williams:  Why?  Why th
e Br itis h zone?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  To escape the partis ans .  Becaus e they were afraid of repris als .  It was  alr eady 

known at the time, of c our s e, bec aus e the partis ans  had been alr eady
 
--
 
at that point they wer e a for c e 
to be reckoned.  And there wer e m ajor, m ajor battles  with the Germ ans  and the Us tas a.  Not in 

Ludbreg
 
--
 
ther e wer e battles  but the major battles  were fought all over  what us ed to be Yugos lavia and 
what was  to bec om e Yugos lavia after  the war .
 
> > LynnWilliams:  So the end of war  was n't always
 
the end of horr ific  things happening for you.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  No.  But for  us , pers onally, it was  ok.  My unc le was  to s ort of c ontinue a reas onable 

life in term s of work .  But for us it was ,
 
again
 
--
 
we waited to s ee if 
anybo
dy  was  going
 
to r eturn.  We
 
waited to s ee if my parents  would r eturn. We had no idea what happened to them.  My unc le did s ee 
m y father but he didn't k now what happened to him .
 
 
What ac tually happened to him, toward the end of the war , is  that he and a number of other 
people broke out of the cam p.  They knew that the war was  at an end.  The Us tas a were just going to 

kill everybody and get rid of the c am p. Whic h they did.  But s om e people es c aped.  And unfortunately 

9 
 
the group that my father was  with s tum bled on to a patrol, Germ an patr ol.  Som e of them
 
--
 
some 
people wer e able to get away but my father was  killed.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Las ted alm ost to the end of the war.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  To the very end of the war .  My m other not.  But, of cours e, we at that time didn't 
know.  So ever
ybody waited.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Did any of your  r elatives  s ur vive? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  On m y mother 's s ide of the family only one brother retur ned, one pers on 
r eturned.  His  wife and his  daughter  wer e killed.  He eventually r em ar r ied.  He wanted me 
t
o go with 
him
 b
ut he in the meantim e remar ried.  He had two daughters, his  new wife had two daughter s.  They 
would c ome to Ludbreg to s ee us but ther e was  no s ens e of my wanting to go with them  at all.
 
 
And then on my father 's  s ide of the fam ily, one unc le
 
als o c ame back .  One unc le c am e back  
and he ver y m uc h wanted m e to go with him.  There was  a s ort of
 
--
 
not a ver y nic e c onvers ation 
between the unc le and wher e am I going to go.  I was  as ked at the age of 7 what I wanted to do.  
 
 
And, of c ours e, what I hadn't mentioned is  that immediately after  the war, pr etty m uc h 
imm ediately, m y unc le with whom  I was  gr owing up, with whom  I was  all this  time, adopted my br other 

and m e.  So we wer e offic ially now adopted alr eady.  The minute m y par ents  didn't c om e back
 h
e 
adopted us.  
 

 
Now the unc les  are arr iving and they want me to go with them.  And ther e was  a little 
unpleas ant dis c us s ion going on about wher e am I going to go.  Finally they as ked m e.  And I s aid no 
way, I'm not going anywhere.  I wanted to stay with m y unc le whom  I loved
; s
uper, fantastic  pers on.  He 
had los t his wife. We wer e all he had.
 
 
In the m eantim e, unfortunately what als o happened, in 1946, my br other died of sc ar let fever.  
So at the tim e all of these dec is ions  wer e being m ade, ac tually, I was  just
 
--
 
it was  jus t m e.  I s aid, no, 
I'm not going.  
 

 
So this  unc le, m y father's br other, and m y mother 's  brother, both of thes e unc les s urvived 
bec aus e both of them wer e pris oners of war , Germ an pris oners of war .  And the reas on they wer e
 

pr is oner s  of
 
war bec ause they had been in the Yugos lav Arm y at the time of the oc c upation had 
oc c urr ed.  So Germ ans cam e and these two wer e deport
ed
 
as pr is oners  of war  and they s ur vived the 
pr is oner  of war c amp.
 
 
Another  aunt of m ine s urvived with her c hildren in the
 
m ountains  but she did not r etur n.  She 
jus t went dir ectly to Is rael.
  
Thes e two went to Pales tine.  And one unc le als o s ur vived on m y 
m other 's
 
--
 
on my father 's  s ide of the family.  He s urvived in Ber gen
-
B els en with his  wife
,w
as  par t of a 
fairly well
-
know
n thing that happened.  He was  on a tr ain with people that went to Bergen
-
Bels en and 
were later res c ued into Switzerland.  So there he was  in Switzerland.  So thos e wer e the ones  who 

were res c ued. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  You go to Switzerland?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:
  
Eventually he c onnec ted with me.  He wr ote.  He had marr ied.  They wer e in 
c am ps, of c our s e in Switzerland as  well
, i
n a r es ettlem ent kind of c am p for a while.  Then they wer e 
allowed to s tay, whic h not everybody was  allowed to s tay in Switzerland that e
nded up there
 b
ut they 
were allowed to s tay.  When they finally s ettled that they wer e going to be ther e, he wr ote to Ljudevit to 
find if anybody was  alive and found m e.
 
 
So in elem entar y s c hool, during my elementary sc hool, in the m iddle of s chool age, we
 
exc hanged s om e letters .  They s ent s om e little pac kages  for us .  After the war we had prac tic ally 
nothing.  Not only was  it after the war but it was  als o we are under Com munis t governm ent.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  How was  that for your  unc le, too?
 

> > Dor a K laym
an:  My unc le was  ok  bec aus e even though he was  from the ar is toc ratic  family, that 
was n't the is s ue.  He had been a ver y r es pec ted citizen of that town for a ver y long tim e.  He was  a 

m ayor of the town.  He was  jus t ver y highly r es pec ted and loved by every
one.  And his  family
 
--
 
I hadn't 
m entioned it before.  His  fam ily
 
--
 
he had a ver y lar ge family at one point but they wer e all s omehow ill 
with s omething or  other, m os t with
 
Tuber c ulos is , ac c idents , and s o on s o that actually he was  all by  
him s elf at this  
point, whic h is  why it was  s o im portant for him to have m e.  You know, on both s ides, it 

10
 
 
was  a love on both s ides. 
 
But politic ally he was  fine bec aus e he had been on the r ight s ide.  He had 
his  job back.  It didn't pay ver y muc h but nobody
 
--
 
ever ybody was  in the same boat. We didn't have 
very muc h but we didn't have ver y m uc h together.  So it was  ok . 
 
 
At any point, by the time I got to high s c hool, m y unc le from Switzer land wrote again and 
as ked if I c ould c om e and vis it.  As m any people know, you didn't jus t go vis iting Switzerland from a 
Com munis t c ountr y.  But I was  allowed to go becaus e I was  what was  at that time labeled a vic tim of 

fas c is m.  So I was  given a vis a and a pass port.  The Swis s  deliberated for  a while but eventually they 
gave the vis a
.  
 
So at the age of 16 I was  now in high sc hool.  We had enough money, m y unc le s ort of had 
s om e family things  we could s ell, a gold c hain or s omething, and I had enough none buy a ticket to go 

to Switzer land.  It was n't very expensive bec aus e you went by train, of c our s e.
 
 
So I left.  We c ould only take
 
$5 with us .  I had this
 
$5.  I arr ived
 
ac tually to the Italian bor der , 
t
o the bor der between Switzer land and Italy.  And my unc le was  waiting for m e in the Swis s  town, at the 
bor der.  It was  quite a r eunion
.  That's  the fir s t time that I r eally, s inc e I was  7, the firs t time I m et 
anyone from m y blood fam ily fr om m y actual family. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  And he was  a religious man.  Wasn't he?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  So this is  the thing.  All of a s udden I ended up
 
--
 
he took  me, of c our s e, 
hom e.  There was  his  c hildren, wife.  It was  nic e.  But I found m ys elf in a Jewis h, Or thodox J ewis h 

family.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Right.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I knew abs olutely nothing about J ewis h Or thodoxy or about J udaism .  Of c o
ur s e, 
ever ybody was  Catholic  wher e I was .  But als o, after the war , of c our s e, nobody pr ac tic ed any religion.  
So religion was r eally totally of m inor im portanc e.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  In Ludbreg.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Right.  No religion bec aus e of the Comm unism.  Religion was  totally not
 
--
 
if you 
were religious, you just wouldn't even get a job.  So that was  really not the thing.
 
 
So I found mys elf in this  Orthodox family hav ing to all of a s udden lear n, as  I was  trying to 
help m y aunt, having to lear n, you kno
w,
 
how to separate meat dis hes from  milk  dis hes  and all kinds  of 
differ ent things.
  
They were lovely people.  I enjoyed them  very muc h. We had a 
good tim e together.  
They s aid, ﬁWell, how would you like to c ome back  onc e you ar e at the univer s ity?
ﬂ
  
 
 
So 
when was  I r eady to finis h high sc hool
 
--
 
I was  going to be an Englis h major  at the 
univers ity.  I had studied Englis h from the tim e I was  13.  I r eally loved the language.  So I was  an 

Englis h major .  I thought, well, it would be nic e to go to Switzer land
 
and als o s tudy Frenc h.  So I fas t 
s tudied
 
--
 
s tarted to s tudy Fr enc h.  I applied to go for  a year to go to Switz erland for  a year. 
 
What 
happened was  that it took  m e alm ost a year again to get papers.  Eventually, for the s ec ond year of 

university, I left
 
to go to Switzer land.

> > Dora Klaym an:  I was  on the tra
in to Switzer land.  That's  the Orient Expres s  that goes thr ough all 

the way fr om Istanbul to Par is .  It was an unus ual tim e.  It was , well, for the United States it was  a 
diffic ult tim e.  It was  1957.  It was  a time
 
--
 
all the pr oblem s of des egr egating s c hools  in the 
S
outh.  It 
was  a tim e of the gover nor  in fr ont of the s c hool, not allowing Afric an Am er ic an c hildr en to enter the 

s c hool.  
 
 
How did that 
a
ffect m e?  Well, I was on this train and ther e were three young people, young 
m en, outs ide of wher e I was  s itting.  They were dis c us s ing exac tly that.  There was  a Yugos lav, an 

engineer, who was  appar ently a ver y devout Comm unis t.  He was  s omehow allowed to get out.  Then 

ther e was  a Br itis her and this Am er ic an.  I didn't k now who they wer e but I was
,  
like
, 
dying to hear what 
they wer e talking about bec aus e s inc e I had been an Englis h m ajor and studied for s o long, I never  had 

an opportunity to ac tually
 
--
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Us e it?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  To use it or hear  it even.  I imm ediately
 
--
 
I was like all 
ears
 a
nd then telling other  
people what was  going on.  And this  Communis t guy was  attacking this Am er ic an
.  Y
ou know, how c an 

11
 
 
you be?  What kind of a c ountr y are you?  And he's  s aying, well, you know, not m e, not all of us  are like 
that
; w
e are trying to s olve it.  The pr es ident had already s ent the troops, etc ., etc.  And then finally it 
br oke up.  The c onvers ation br oke up.  But I was  dyi
ng to talk to s ome of them  s ome m ore just to 
pr ac tic e.  So I took a little tr ip.  And this  young man, the Am er ic an, s aid, 
ﬁO
h, what pretty r ed hair.
ﬂ
  
At 
this  time m y hair was  youthful. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  [Laughter]
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So I s aid, ﬁY
es.
ﬂ
  
So
 
we s tarted talking.  And we had a wonderful time talking to one 
another.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Evidently.  You got m ar ried.  Right?  [Laughter]
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  And we exc hanged addr es s es .  He went off in Venic e, off to Naples  to take a ship 

bac k  to the states.  I went to Switzer land.  Ver y s oon I got a letter.  Eventually I ans wer ed.  Then I got 

another.  And I answer ed.  I must s ay that at one point finally we dis c overed that we wer e both J ewis h.  
Bec aus e he asked m e, you know, what was  I
 
--
 
what was  I doing in Switzerland.  And I told him a little 
bit of the his tory.  He wrote back  and s aid he was  J ewis h.  Well, that was  v er y inter esting to m y aunt 

and unc le who were pr obably inviting m e not to study Fr enc h but to find a hus band.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Right. 
 
[Laughter ]
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So they kind of pus hed the whole thing.  But anyway.  We c or res ponded for quite a 
while.  Then he asked me in the letters to m arr y him.  I s aid yes . 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  [Laughter]
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So he c am e back  to Switzerland and we were married in Switzerland.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Very nic e.
 
> > Dora Klaym an: We lived happily ever  after  until 1992 when unfortunately my hus band pas s ed 

away.
 
> > LynnWilliam s:  Dor a, we r eally want to thank you.  She gets  the las t word, s o befor e we end, we 
would like to take a few m inutes and s ee if there are any questions fr om  the audienc e. We just have a 
few minutes .
 
 
Do we have a few m inutes  for  this ?  I hope so.  
 
 
So if you have a question for  Dor a, pleas e stay in the auditor ium .  Don't leave.  She's going to 
always  have the las t word.
 
 
I s ee an ar m.  Yes. 
 
>> 
When you were 16, you went to Switzer land to vis it but then went back  to Yugos lavia?  Was ther e 
no s ens e that ther e was  no fear of going back to Yugos lavia?  No s ens e that you would be able to get 

out again
 o
r  wer e you thinking you would jus t stay? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I didn't have really any fear.  I don't think
 
--
 
in Yugos lavia, I know in r etros pec t that 
ther e wer e m any pers ecutions  but I was  not totally awar e of it.  And als o there wer e politic ally
 
--
 
people 
who were politic ally motivated, c ritic izing the gover nm ent and s o on whic h I was  not doing.  Sinc e I was  
allowed to go out, I was n't r eally fearful.  And it didn't occur to m e not to com e back  bec aus e of my 
unc le.  I would have nev er  wanted to abandon him .  It was  my home.  I was  r etur ning hom e.
 

 
I had a s ens e that maybe I c ould go back out again.  I was  ver y fas c inated by the 
W
est.  A nd, 
of c ours e, lots of people had not had that opportunity.  So when I was  in high s c hool, I 
was  going from 
class to class telli
ng people what it was  like out West.  It's amazing what fas c inated m e.  I r emember, 
for example, telling everybody how when you go to where the s uperm arkets  and how when you 

appr oac h one, the door s opened by them s elves .
 
>
> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  There was  one in Switzer land.  And that's  what it was . 
 
On the other  hand, later on, 
after  I got m arried, I did not go back  home bec aus e at that point it would have taken I don't know how 
long to again get the permis s ion to come out.  And that would have been tr ic ky.
 
 
So we wer e m ar ried in Switzer land.  Unfor tunately I did not get to go s ee my unc le at that 
point and he c ouldn't c ome out for the wedding.  So your  ques tion is  well taken in a s ens e that, yes , 
that was  happening 
but not at that tim e.
  
It was  a pr oblem later  on.  In fact, I did not go back  until I got 
m y Am er ic an c itizens hip and I r equested a r elease from Yugos lav c itizenship whic h I did get bec aus e I 

12
 
 
was  afr aid at that point, you know, you had to go and do s o
-
c all
ed volunteer  wor k  and maybe go in the 
Ar m y or whatever.  So I did not go back  until I was  an Am eric an c itizen.  So that was  five years  later.  
After I got here.  And I alr eady had c hildr en s o all of us went back .  And it was  wonder ful. 
 
> > Lynn William s:  
Yes ?  We have a question down her e. 
 
>> 
What happened to your unc le in Yugos lavia?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  My unc le in Yugos lavia eventually pas s ed away.  Think  about it.  He was  quite 
elder ly.  He was  bor n in 1885.  So that's  why I'm s aying
 
--
 
I was  s aying that
 
m y aunt was  15 years  older 
than my mother and he was  10 year s  older than she.  So I was  being bas ic ally brought up by s om eone 

who would be the age of a gr andfather .  Could have been.  So, you know, we went back
 
--
 
m y hus band 
and c hildr en and I went bac k  twic e.  Then he died.  It was  very 
har d to 
have to leave him alone.
 
At that point, we always  had
 
--
 
well from the beginning we had
 
--
 
after the war we had m or e like 
housekeepers, nannies, to take car e of me.  There was  one that we had for a very long time. 
 
She was  
with him for 20 year s and took  c are of him. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Somebody
 
--
 
the gentlem an her e. 
 
>> 
[Ques tion Inaudible]
 
> > LynnWilliams:  The ques tion is
 
--
 
in c as e everyone didn't hear.  Do you know wher e your  par ents  
r em ains  ar e?
 

> > Dor a K laym
an:  Abs olutely not.  J as enovac  is now a m emorial s ite.  In fac t, that's  what br ought m e 
to the m us eum , to be a volunteer here.  An arc hive out of J as enovac  c am e her e.  Ther e was  a need for 
s om eone who c ould read the language.  So I s igned up and s tayed. 
 
 
The ar c hive
 
--
 
well, you pr obably know, Yugos lav had fallen apart again and now is  Croatia, 
Serbia, and all the c ons tituent parts .  And dur ing that las t war, the J as enovac archive dis appear ed.  
One thing I didn't stres s  m uc h but one of the pr oblem s  in Yugos lavia that was  differ ent fr om els ewher e 

dur ing the war , the Serbs  were pers ec uted in the camps .  So when the war  started between Ser bia and 
Croatia, the Serbs fear ed they m ight destr oy the arc hival m ater ial.  So the head of J asenovac  
abs c onded
 
this  mater
ial.  Then it c am e back.  It bec am e k nown where it was .  And this  m us eum  was  
the agenc y c hos en to help r es c ue it out and br ing it here.  It was  all her e.  The s taff and the volunteer s  

her e organized it all and c leaned it up and put it into proper shape.  And now there is  a m emor ial in a 

s or t of m us eum on that site.  So I know their bones  ar e ther e but.
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Don't know where.  
 
 
Do we have time for one m or e?  One m or e question.  It's all the way in the back in the c orner .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Anybody wants  to ask  ques tions  later you c an. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  Yes .  Yes .  We'll give you that.
 
>> 
What has the s ignificanc e of J udaism been for you s inc e the war ? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  That's  a good question.  Well, s inc e m y hus band was  J ewish and I had then 
liv ed 

with m y fam ily for a year , I had r eally ac c epted that faith as  m ine.  I feel very J ewis h.  I'm not 
par tic ular ly r eligious  but I do belong to a s ynagogue and m y c hildren have been brought up

they we

and dis c over y.  
 
 
I'm ver y c los e to all of my fam ily in Is r ael.
  
The two c hildr en

m y c ous ins in Switzer la

whom  I lived for a year , wher e I had m y wedding, they were 5 and 12 at the time that I left.  They are 
m y very clos e c ous ins .  I feel like they are m y brother s.  They lived in Is r ael.  I vis it them a lot.  Half of 
m y family in Is rael, whoever s urvi

whoever  has  s ur vived is  in Isr ael.  Half of them ar e quite 
r eligious , not cr azy r eligious  but, Or thodox. 
 
> > LynnWilliams:  [Laughter]

Dora Klayman:  And half of them is  alm ost totally s ec ular .  So I vis it them.  I have a ver y good tim e 
with both s ides  of that divide.  I do feel very J ewis h.  I apprec iate the Catholic  world has  br ought m e up
