J ulie Keefer was  bor n J ula Weinstock  to J ewis h parents in Lwow, Poland, on April
 
19, 1941.  
This  photograph of J ulie is  the only one that exis ts  fr om her time in hiding.
 
 
On this  map of Poland the arr ow points  to Lwow wher e J ulie was  born.
 
 
This  
photograph s hows  Julie's  maternal grandfather, Aizik Eisen, as a young m an wear ing his 
m ilitar y uniform.
 
 
In this  photogr aph, J ulie's  father, Her m an, is the man farthes t to the left with the mus tac he and 
her  mother , Sala, is the wom an farthes t to the left.
  
Bes ides J ulie, Herm an and Sala als o had a younger 
daughter named Tola.
 
 
In J une
 
1941, the Germ ans  oc c upied Lwow.  German author ities, ass is ted by Uk r ainian 
authorities, for c ed all J ews  into a ghetto enc los ed by a wooden fenc e.  On this  m ap the white ar ro
w 
points  to the loc ation of the ghetto.  J ulie's grandfather was selec ted for forc ed labor.  After wor king at a

lime s tone quarr y, he then worked at J anows ka labor  c amp, indic ated here with the r ed ar r ow.  The 
near by Kleparow train s tation is  indic ated by 
the blue arr ow.
 
 
J ulie took this  photogr aph of the Kleparow train station in 2013.  Thous ands  of J ews  fr om the 
Lwow ghetto were deported fr om  this  station to the Belzec  exter mination camp, inc luding m em bers of 
J ulie's  extended fam ily.  J ulie's  gr andfather  
eventually es c aped fr om labor c am p.  He lear ned that the 
Lwow ghetto would be des troyed and helped J ulie, her  parents, and her sis ter to hide in a bunker in a 
near by for est with other J ewis h es c apees .  J ulie and her s is ter's c r ies plac ed everyone at risk, 
s o A iz ik 
m oved the gir ls  to live with a non
-
J ewis h family friend, Luc ia.
 
 
This  photograph s hows  Luc ia Nowic ka on the left and Julie's grandfather, Aiz ik, on the right.  
Aiz ik as s um ed the identity of Luc ia's hus band and Luc ia and Aizik pretended 
they 
were their aunt and 
unc le.
 
 A
iz ik traveled back and for th between the town and the for es t wher e J ulie's  parents  hid.  At 
one point Luc ia was  arr es ted by Sec urity Polic e.  With Luc ia in pr is on, Aizik  hid J ulie's s is ter  in a 
Catholic  c hildren's  hom e.  Luc ia eventually was  releas ed from pr is on and continued c ar ing for J ulie.  
One day while Aizik was  vis iting the gir ls , Ger mans  dis c over ed the bunker  in the fores t and killed 
ever yone there, inc luding J ulie's  par ents.  At the end of the war, as Soviet tr oops  approac hed
, 
Germ ans evac uated the c hildren's  hom e wher e Julie's  s is ter hid.  Aizik and Julie were unable to find 

Julie's sister .
 
 
Her e we s ee J ulie and Aizik in a Dis placed Pers ons  Camp after the war.  Aiz ik s ent J ulie to 
Am er ic a in 1948, hoping to join later .  J uli e lived in a c hildr en's  home for s ix year s  until a c ouple fr om 

Cleveland, Ohio, adopted her.  Aizik m ar r ied Luc ia and they eventually imm igr ated to the United States  
and s ettled in New York.

Bill Benson:  J ulie, thank  you for joining us .  It's  a privilege to have you her e as our
 
First Pers on
 
and 
als o to s ee that we have your  fam ily here r ight in the fr ont r ow.  They c an k eep an eye on you. 
 
 
J ulie, we have jus t a very s hor t hour  together.  You have a great deal to share with us  s o we'll 
start.
  
Wor ldWar II began with Germ any and Russ ia's  invas ion in Poland in Septem ber
 
1939.  When 
you wer e born, Apr il
 
1941, the c ity with your fam ily lived was  under  Soviet oc c upation.  I know you 
know very little about your  fam ily and c ir c umstanc es  for  them  prior to the war but to the extent you c an, 
tell us  what you're able to tell us about your  family before your  bir th. 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  My gr andfather  had two c hildr en.  My m other was  the younger .  The m an i
n the 
unifor m, in the pic ture you s aw, the Polis h uniform, was  my unc le whos e name I don't know.  The 
woman below him was  his  wife.  They had two s ons .  I know they wer e killed.  I don't know exac tly 
wher e. 
 
 
My par ents , we were tak en

we had gone to L

in October
 
2012 and we v is ited the plac e 
wher e I was  liv ing with my par ents , s uppos edly.  Later, for thos e who are interested, I have s om e 

photos  that we took  s o that you c an see the apar tment.
 
 
Then we were for c ed

in J uly, my grandfather wrote

m y 
gr andfather wr ote all of these 
things in a diar y after he imm igr ated to the United States  in 1950.  The or iginal of that diar y is  in Englis h 

tr ans lation in this m us eum.
 
Our grandfather  was  an im porter of fruits and vegetables , pr etty well to do.  My parents  were 
pr obably
 
--
 
I don't know.  My father was  a tins mith, my mother was  a J ewish oper a singer.  When the 
Rus s ians  c ame, I think it probably was  too bourgeois  to be an oper a s inger s o s he was
 
c ited as  wor king 
in a factor y.
 
 
I don't know muc h els e.
 
> > Bill
 
Bens on:  J ulie, one of the things you s hared with m e
 
--
 
you r eally told me you don't r eally 
r em em ber your parents but ther e is  a partic ular  song that you s aid that evokes a feeling or m emory of 
your  mother .  Tell us about that.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Ther e is
 
--
 
of all things, I was  brought up s peaking Polish and s ome Ger man but not 
Yiddis h.  And I only lear ned Yiddis h in DP c am p after the war.  But this  partic ular  lullaby
 
--
 
I can't 
r em em ber exac tly the nam e
 
--
 
is  a s ong I remem ber m y mother s inging to me.  I heard a r ec or ding.  It 
jus t churned up that mem or y of m y m other .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J ulie, at that time you did have a few fam ily members  living in the United States.  Is  
that s o? 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  I had my gr andfather 's two s is ters .  He was  the oldes t of s ix.  Then came Aunt Rosa, 

the s ec ond oldest.  Then c am e three br other s.  And then the youngest, Helen.
 
 
Befor e the war, long befor e the war , m y gr andfather 's father s ent the girls to the United States 
s o they would not suffer  dur ing the Pogr om s  that were going on.  They s ettled in Br ooklyn.  And when I 

fir s t c ame to the United States, I lived with Aunt Helen who s har ed a duplex hous e, part of a duplex, 
with her older s ister Rosa, who was  a widow.  And Aunt Helen had a daughter four  year s  older  than I 
was .  
Ros a had a daughter  who was eight year s  older  than I. 
 
 
I als o had m y father's  aunt, I c alled Tanta Sigel.  I didn't like Englis h ver y m uc h s o my father 's  
s is ter s were c alled aunt and my gr andfather's  s isters  
--
 
m y gr andfather's  s is ters.  My father 's  aunt 
I 
c alled 
Tanta Sigel.  She was  as  war m as  s he c ould poss ibly be.  She was this  tiny, tiny woman with 

4 
 
high, high c heekbones  and huge, bright blue eyes , a little Cupid m outh.  She and Unc le J ak e had two 
c hildren, Adele and Mar v in.  Mar vin was  in the Army.  Adele was  newly m ar r ied living with her husband 
in this  tiny, tiny, one
-
bedroom apartment with Tanta Sigel
 
and Unc le J ake.  
 
 
I would go to be with them  on weekends .  I us ed to live for thos e weekends.  They were s o, s o 
warm  and c ar ing.  Aunt Helen s poke Polis h.  No one els e s poke a language I under stood.  But 
apparently, what I was  told, was  that I was  kind of this  s ad s ack  of a kid who with s it on the thir d floor of 

a walkup, tiny apar tm ent, s tar ing out the window, in the Br onx, looking at people walking by and acros s  
the street was  kind of a ballpark wher e people played pic kup bask etball.  And I would just s it ther e and 
not talk , not anything.
  
H
e had won a teddy bear  at one of the am us ement parks and was  s aving that 
teddy bear  for his  fir st c hild.  I guess he took  a look  at m e and thought, hmm
, 
this kid needs it muc h 
m or e than our firs t s o he gave me the teddy
 
bear .  And I rem em ber 
Tanta Sigel
 
s aying, well, what ar e 
you going to c all the teddy bear ?  And I s aid, "La
l
k a" whic h, or iginally as  it could be, it
 
m eans  d
oll in 
Polis h.  And I had m y lal
ka.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nazi Ger m any turned on the Soviet Union J une
 
1941, just m onths  after your bir th.  
Within days your c ity of 
Lwow
 
was  oc c upied by the Nazis  and your  family was  for c ed into a ghetto.  Tell 
us  what that meant for you and for your  fam ily, inc luding your gr andfather, Aizik.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  My gr andfather  had a hous e that was  in the ghetto.  He and s om e male r elatives , my 

father inc luded, built a s ec r et c om partm ent in his bar n whic h they c alled a bunke
r .  That's  wher e my 
father, my m other , m y baby s is ter
 
--
 
well, my baby  s is ter was  born ther e
 
--
 
and I lived there.  And we 
were there fr om
`  
41 until 
`
43. 
 
 
My gr andfather, who had es c aped from J anows ka labor c amp
,  
found out from  the m an who 
had helped him that the Nazis  wer e going to burn the ghetto in 1943.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we turn to that, jus t a c ouple of questions .  As you just mentioned, your 

grandfather es c aped fr om  J anows k a.  Tell us how he got to J anows ka, whic h was  an infamous c am p.
 
> > J ulie
 
Keefer:  It was .  Not only was  it infam ous, ac c or ding to the r ec ords from the Soviets , the 
Nur em berg trials , 200,000 J ews  wer e killed at J anows ka.  It was  a huge, huge
 
--
 
it was  a labor c amp.  It 
was  a c onc entr ation c amp.  And it was  an exterm ination c amp
. 

 
My gr andfather was  ver y  s tr ong.  They put people in lines  and they dec ided, for example his  
wife Clara was  taken to Belzec  and gas s ed but he was  a s tr ong man s o they took  him and other 
r elatives  I do not know to work  in the forc ed labor.  His  job was  to
 
do s omething with r ocks.  And he 
worked in the c utting and c arrying r ocks.
 
 
When he los t 100
 
pounds, bec aus e the food was  almos t non
-
exis tent, the c onditions  were 
hor rible
, 
gr andpa onc e said to one of the Comm andants , "You can't have 16 people on thes e bu
nks.  
They don't fit.  You c ould have eight at mos t."  Bec aus e he s aid that, he got beaten 100 s trokes on his  

bar e body.  It was  only other  pris oners putting wet rags on him at night.  And when it was  time for the 
m or ning lineup, yes , r oll c all kind of thing, he kind of s tum bled out and was  ther e.  The Comm andant 
s aid, "You pig.  You'r e alive.  I thought I killed you." 
 
 
The food was  1/16 of a k ilos  of br ead per day, a weak s oup m ade of s ome c abbage.  And the 
labor  was  intens e.
  
Then, one of the two Comm and
ants
 
--
 
I have a pic ture of the hous e that the 
Com mandants  lived in.  And by the way, it's s till standing.  
Rokita 
would s tand at one of the balconies  
of the hous e.  If he didn't like the way your  J ewis h s tar was  s ewn on your  jac ket or pants, he would 

s hoo
t you in the head.  He had a habit of just shooting J ews  in the head. 
 
 
One of the things  that grandpa des c r ibed was  one of the favor ite ways  of punis hing or  
whatever  was  to hang J ews  ups ide down by their  feet and letting them expire.  He talk s about a fri
end 
of his  who was  killed this way.
 
 
When he had lost 100
 
pounds  and knew that he was  going to be s hot bec aus e he c ould not 
work at the har d labor that he had, he dec ided to es c ape.  As the c entur ies  were letting in new 
pr is oner s
 
--
 
r em ember that the c amp 
was  s ur r ounded by elec tr ic  wire 
--
 
but where the c enturies let in 
new pris oners  he r an out.  And we have a pic tur e of the hill wher e he pr obably ran down.  He r an down, 

c r os s ed the s tr eet, J anows ka Str eet, and jum ped down a tall r avine.  When he jum ped down, he had 

his  hands  up.  And the century m anaged to s hoot his  r ight thumb.  He was  wearing a thin conc entration 

5 
 
c am p uniform , no s hoes  bec aus e his  feet wer e s o big.  He r ipped off the Jewis h s tar off his c hest and 
his  legs and went r unning along with the tr ain to be hidden s o that he did not get s hot anym or e.
  
 
 
This  was  late Novem ber in Poland, s nowing, and very, very c old.  He ran into one woods  
near by.  His  hand was  thr obbing.  He was  fever ish and c old and hot.  After a while he s tumbles  to a 
P olis h, 
s m all farmer's  hous e.  He, of c ours e
 
--
 
you c ould tell he was  a J ew.  He was  wearing the 
c onc entration c am p unifor m.  And, of c ours e, the Polis h farm er  s aw this .  Aiz ik s aid
 
--
 
m y grandfather's 
nam e is Aizik.  He s aid, "I don't want to endanger you."  Bec aus e Pols  who helped J ews  were the mos t 

threatened of all in that their  fam ilies  were taken and hung befor e their eyes .  And then the J ew was  
killed and the Polis h person was  s hot.  So it's  one thing to los e your  life alone but it's quite another 
when it c om es to watc hing your fam ily die. 
 
So it was  a very diffic ult dec is ion for Pols .
 
 
Any way, this  Pol was  an unus ual m an.  He s aid:  Look , Aizik, of cours e, what the Nazis  are 
doing is horr ible.  He put 
mercurochrome
 
on his thum b, bandaged it
, 
gave him a c hange of clothes , 
warm  jacket, r ags , and thes e kind of s lippers with r ags to wr ap ar ound his  feet.  He s aid, you know, he 
c ould s leep in his  barn.  Aiz ik s aid
, ﬁ
I don't want to make you and your fam ily be threatened.
ﬂ
  
A nd 
Mr .
 
Berec zki
 
s aid, you k now, 
ﬁ
I'll ju
st leave the barn door  open and then if the Nazis  c om e, I'll s ay, "I 
don't know who s leeps  in m y bar n.  The door is  open.  Anybody c ould c ome."  So that's what he did. 
 
 
The following day, Mr .
 
Ber ec zki
 
gave him thr ee breads  and s om e s alt and s om e fr uit and
 
a 
s hovel and led him  to the Bor s zc zowic e Fores t, whic h was  a ver y, very lar ge fores t about five or s o 

kilometers away fr om his  hous e.  That's  wher e m y grandfather  began to dig a ditc h with a s hovel to 
hide hims elf fr om the elem ents and als o fr om the Nazis
. 
 
 
In two weeks , he s ays  in his  diary, that he had m ade a tunnel about four feet by two feet.  As 
he was  waiting and jus t tr ying to live, he heard s om e m en approac hing.  Lo and behold, they wer e 
s peaking Yiddis h.  So he got out of this kind of lean
-
to and
 
stood up and they almos t s hot him.  He s aid, 
"Look, I'm a fellow J ew."  So they all rejoic ed.  One of the m en had a gun.  My gr andfather had been a 
s oldier  and a kind of a small
-
tim e offic er, ver y unus ual for a J ew in the Firs tWor ldWar.  And then he 
was
 
in the Polis h c avalry  afterwar ds  bec aus e he looked good on a hors e.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  So he had m ilitar y experienc e.  So he was  the leader  of this  gr oup.  And the m en 
expanded the tunnel, expanded the tunnel.  Mor e and m ore J ews  were c om ing
 
into thes e woods  from  
various  s m all towns  around bec aus e the Nazis  wer e gathering up Jews  to take them to the gas  

c hamber s. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J ulie, over  tim e it ended up with m or e than 30 in your  grandfather's gr oup in this  

bunker in the for es t.  They be
gan to engage in acts  of r es istanc e agains t the Nazis.  Tell us  a little 

about that and then how you and your  family als o ended up in the bunk er with them . 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Ok.  The people in the tunnel would attack  Nazi m unitions tr ucks, s hoot the tir es
 
and 
kill the dr ivers  who would not run away, and s teal grenades , guns, am munition, clothing, anything they 
c ould get their hands  on.  Then they would s tor e it.  They would br ing it bac k  at night and store it in this  
bunker. 
 
 
Then the s ec ond ques tion you 
asked me?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How you and your par ents  ended up in the bunk er. 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Mr.
 
Berec zki
 
had been tak en as a politic al pris oner to J anows ka.  And then the 
politic al pris oners  were let go.  He was  taken becaus e his  s on was  killed as  a m ember of the Polis h 

underground.  He told my gr andfather  that the politic al pris oners wer e let out to m ake r oom for m ore 
J ews  bec ause the Nazis  were going to bur n the ghetto s oon.  The vic tims  would be taken to the 
Kleparow
 
s tation to be gas s ed at Belzec  or 
to J anows ka. 
 
 
Any way, when gr andpa found this  out
 
--
 
we wer e hiding in the ghetto, remem ber, in that barn.  
So he m ade arr angem ents  with Mr .
 
Beretzki to hide my m other , m y baby s is ter, and m e in part of his  
bar n to s ave our  lives.  Then he made thos e arr angements and he asked for volunteer s  of the men.  All
 
the m en volunteered.  He picked five.  They took
 
a c ommandeer ed Nazi truck  and drove near the 
ghetto.  My gr andfather said
, ﬁS
tay in the woods  and I'll go into the ghetto alone.
ﬂ
  
He went into the 
ghetto and got my m other , m y father, m y baby s ister, and me out.
 

6 
 
 
The interesting thing is  m y baby s is ter had been born.  She was  bor n September  of 1943.  
And that was fir st time my grandfather saw her .  He had los t s o muc h weight and his  hair was  from  
br own turned to white.  His  daughter, m y m other, didn't rec og nize him.  But the stor y I was  told was  that 
I did and I r an up to him and gr abbed his  legs  and said, "
Dziadz ia
," whic h m eans  
G
r andpi.  We were 
very, very c los e he and I. 
  
Then my father took  the baby, my gr andfather took  m e and got us  into the 

c om m and tr
uck , out of the ghetto, and then drove us  to Mr .
 
Bere
cz
ki's.
 
 
What I r emember about that is  very, ver y little.  All I rem em ber is the sm ell.  And the s m ell was  
like amm onia.  What I was  told was  they were tr ying to dye my mother's hair blond.  So I don't k
now 
whether  this  was  fr om bleac h or peroxide or c ow ur ine bec aus e there wer e c ows  r ight her e.  But 
nevertheles s , m y m other s aid
, ﬁ
I won't stay her e.  I've alr eady los t m y m other.  I don't want to los e my 
hus band and my father.  And I'm not going to be sepa
r ated.
ﬂ 
 
You c ouldn't argue with my m other.  Appar ently s he was  quite s
tubbor n.  So we all
 
--
 
the 
c om m and truck  went back .  My grandfather, my father, my mother and I tr udged in the woods  to the 
bunker.  Snow was  falling.  I rem em ber  s ticking out m y tongue and tas ting s now.  And it was  s o s pec ial. 
 
 
So we got to the bunker .  The bunker
 
--
 
it's  inter esting bec aus e I r emember the bunker but no 
one in it except m y grandfather.  The bunker was  this  huge tunnel.  And I rem em ber a ladder that 
s eemed ver y, very high to m e but was  pr obably only s ix feet.  You went down this  ladder .  
Dziadz ia
 
s ays  there was  s tr aw at the bottom.  I don't remem ber the s tr aw. What I remember  is touc hing the 
walls .  They wer e m uddy and dam p and c old.  The r oom  was  pr obably about 12
-
by
-
8 or s omething like 
that.  I don't k now.  But I r em em ber walking along and feeling the walls  and walking.  At the very end of 

this so
-
c alled r oom  was  a s plint
er y
, wooden
 
r oundtable.  On top of it s at a fat c andle.  This  was  the only 
s our ce of light.  Then 
as  you went ar ound, ther e was  an opening.  I k ept feeling m y way.  And then 
ther e was  another r oom , s m aller, c om pletely dark. What I r emem ber  is that I was  about to touc h 

s om ething c old and s mooth and 
Dziadzia
 
s c r eamed at m e
,  
"Stop."  He was  about to smack m y hand.  I 
m ean,
 
m y grandfather never  rais ed
 
his  voic e to me m uc h les s  his  hand.  Later I found out thos e were 
r ifles , guns , and gr enades . 
 
 
So what I hear  about this bunker is  that in the Bors zc zowic e For es t wer e a very big and 
well
-
ar m ed band of Ukrainian r es is tanc e fighters.  And they were the follower s  of Bander a.  And they 
were c alled Bander ivts i.  The Nazis  didn't like c oming into that woods  bec aus e the Banderivts i would go 

on tops of tree and throw all kinds
 
of g
r enades , whatever  at Nazi who kept 
los ing people.  So they 
didn't
 
--
 
and there were 200 of them.  They were well
-
ar m ed and well trained.
 
 
My gr andfather asked if they c ould join them.  And the 
Bander ivts i
 
s aid no.  They didn't m uc h 
like J ews  either.  But they s aid, ok, you leave us  alone, we'll leave you alone, whic h was  a big deal.  
And the only J ews  they wanted and they kind of c ons c ripted, wer e J ewis h doc tors . 
 
 
So the Nazis  thought that all of thes e r aiding ac tivities  were being done by the B
anderivts i
.  
They didn't r ealize that this  s mall band of J ews  was  doing the s ame thing and going to various  outpos ts  
of Uk rainian c ollaborators  and getting food and c lothing and so forth.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J ulie, your  grandfather made the dec is ion to take you and your baby s is ter , Tola, out of 
the bunker and back  into hiding in Lwow.  Tell us  what prompted that dec is ion and then after he did 
that, he returned to the bunker  and tell us what happened. 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  He
 
--
 
I was  about 2
 
1/2.  My s is ter was  5 months old.  It was  c old and damp.  Food 
was
 
s c ar c e.  Ther e was  c anned milk.  All of us had lic e, terr ible, ter r ible lice.  We c ried and m ade nois e
.  
A
nd thaw was  c om ing.  People began to be very, very frightened that the Nazis  would pic k up the 
s m ell, the Nazi polic e dogs, or  hear the s ounds  of us  crying.  There were four  c hildren amongst 37 
people.  Two of the c hildr en wer e in their teens and then there was  m y baby s is ter , a 5 months, and 

m e. 
 
When I s tar ted c rying, m y father would tell m e to be quiet and I gues s I would lis ten but 
when
 
--
 
how do you s top a 5
-
m onth
-
old baby fr om  cr ying?  My m other  would put her hand over  her  
m outh.  And my gr andfather  w
as  afr aid that s he would s mother the baby.  So he s aid that being in 
c harge he was  r espons ible for everybody's  life not just his fam ily and he c ouldn't allow us  to jeopar dize 

the lives  of all of thes e other  people.  After  all, everyone has  a right to live.
 

7 
 
 
So he dr es s ed
 
--
 h
e got Mr .
 
Berec zki
 
help him , dres s ed as a Polis h peas ant with the typic al 
kind of c oat, jacket that they wore.  He got a c art that Mr.
 
Berec zki
 
would us e to bring t
hings  to the 
c entr al m ark et in Lwow
 
and s et out with us.  He was  looking
 
for Dr.
 
Gr or, who was  at a c hildr en's 
or phanage in 
Lwow
.  He looked and no Dr .
 
Gr or .  He des c r ibes in his  diar y how he got des perate and 
he was  about to leave us bec aus e he thought we wer e c ute, we wer e little, somebody would find us 
and take c ar e of us and he would c om e back  if he lived after the war  and get us.
 
 
J us t as  he was  about to do that, he ran into a Polis h Catholic  wom an, Luc ia, who us ed to be a 
neighbor of his .  He helped her and her hus band, who ran kind of a taxi c ab bus ines s  with hor s es .  

Th
ey wer e ver y c lose fr iends .  Meanwhile, Luc ia's  hus band had been tak en away or killed in one of the 
m as s r epr is als.  But he said
 
--
 
s he s aid, "
E is en
, I'm s o happy to s ee you.  Mr .
 
E is en
, thes e m ust be
 
Sala's  babies."  And gr andpa s aid, "Luc ia,
 
c an you take
 
them and take c are of them ?"  And s he s aid, "I
 
no longer own m y own hous e. I work as a live
-
in hous ekeeper  to a retired Polis h Catholic  c ouple.  
I 
would have to ask .
ﬂ  
 
So they m ade up a stor y.  The s tor y was  that my grandfather was  Luc ia's  hus band.  He 
to
ok
 
--
 
fortunately they wer e the s am e height, s ame hair c olor, sam e eye c olor.  So he took  her  
hus band's  identity papers  and a c opy of the m ar riage lic ens e and pr etended to be her  hus band.
 
 
How to explain us .  We, my baby s is ter and I, were s uppos edly her sister's childr en.  Her 
s is ter lived in a s m all town not far and s uppos edly had died and that Luc ia had to take car e of her little 

niec es  bec aus e her s is ter  had died.
  
So we wer e the niec es  and we went to live in that hous e where the 
S wier c z ys kis  lived.  Gr
andpa was  wor king as  a labor er anywher e he c ould find to br ing in s om e food or 
whatever .  The Swier c zy s kis did not know that we were J ewis h.
 
 
Now, there's an interesting thing.  The Swier c z yskis  had a hous e whos e huge garden abutted 
the gar den of the Nazi 
governor  of 
Lwow
.  So there I was  hiding in plain s ight.  There were Nazi 
s oldier s  all over  the place. 
 
 
Now, as  Bill m entioned, the Gestapo took  Lucia away for questioning bec aus e a woman down 
the str eet had
 
s aid that Luc ia Nowic ka, hous ek eeper  for the Swier c z ys kis , was  hiding J ewis h c hildr en.  
So the Gestapo took  her for ques tioning.  No one, the Swier c z ys kis , no one knew why they were taking 

her .  But 
Dziadz ia
 
c am e bac k  to the hous e
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your gr andfather  c ame back to the hous e. 
 
> > J ulie K
eefer:  To the hous e.  And found that Luc ia was  gone and found out that the Gestapo had 
taken her.  So he talked to Mr s .
 
Swier c z ys ki and as ked her would s he talk  to the wife of the 
Com mandant, they were fr iends , and s ee what s he c ould do to get Luc ia out. 
 
He was  terr ibly wor r ied 
that the Nazis  would tortur e her , Luc ia, and hurt her and that Luc ia would c r ack  under the pres s ure and 

s ay that s he, in fac t, was  hiding J ewis h c hildren and, in fact, Aizik was a Jew and other fact that 
30
-
s om e
-
other J ews  were hiding in a hidden bunker  in the Bors zc zowic e Fores t.
 
 
Well, s he asked.  Mr s .
 
Swier c z ys ki talked to the Com mandant's wife.  The Comm andant got in 
his  c ar and went to Ges tapo headquarters and s aid
, ﬁF
r ee Lucia 
N
ow.
ﬂ
  
That's when everybody found 
out why s he was
 
ther e.  The Gestapo s aid "Clean up and don't tell a s oul what happened her e."  And 
s he was  then taken by that car  back  to the Swier c z ys ki's .  She had not c rac ked.  She had not 

m entioned anything. 
 
 
While s he was  gone, Mr s .
 
S wier c z ys ki had to tak e c ar e of 
me, m y baby s is ter, all the c ooking, 
the c leaning, and a very large hous e, the c ow, the pig, the hor s e and c ouldn't c ope.  So s he s aid
, ﬁ
I 
c an't have a baby.
ﬂ  
So my gr andfather c hanged 
Tola™
s  nam e from  Tola Weinstock  to Antonina Novic ka 
and took  her to the Catholic  orphanage r un by Dr.
 
Gr or , who was  a very fam ous  pr ofes s or of pediatric s , 
a 
pediatric ian who r an a c hildren's  home.  So gr andpa thought, well, at leas t one of us would live 
through this  war.  And if he did live, he would c om e back  after  the war 
and get her. 
 

> > Bill Bens on:  So when Luc ia was  r eleas ed fr om the Gestapo and c ame back, by that time Tola was  
now in the or phanage and you are ther e with Mr s .
 
Swier c z ys ki.  At that point I think  your gr andfather  
dec ided, ok , things  are ok  for  the kids an
d he dec ided to r etur n to the bunk er  at that point.  Didn't he? 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Ther e was  one thing that happened in between, if I may.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Abs olutely. 
 

8 
 
> > Julie Keefer:  One day Luc ia was  taking a walk  thr ough the woods , looking for any s p
are potato, 
anything s he c ould find for  food.  I was  going with her.  At this  point I was  3.  She was  teac hing me how 
to pick  
Dande
lions  with long s tems s o s he c ould make m e a wr eath.  I pic ked the Dande
lions , m ore or 
les s  with long stem s , and s he m ade me a wreath.  She kept on walking.  I got tired.  And apparently 
--
 
this  is  what I was  told.  I do not r em ember  this .  She kept walking and I just was  tired s o I fell down and 
fell as leep.  
 

 
Pr etty s oon s omething picks me up, s om ebody pic ks me up, and c arr ie
s  m e to the hom e of 
the Swier c z ys kis.  Luc ia was  s ure that I had gone home before her.  She sees  this Nazi s oldier  c arrying 

what s he thought was  my dead body and s he's about to sc r eam .  And Mrs.
 
Swier c z ys ki, who s pok e 
Germ an and Luc ia did not, s aid, "Luc ia, be c alm " and put her  hand over  her  m outh.  Then, whatev er, I 

woke up.  And at that point I woke up and the s oldier  s aid, "You know, s he r em inds  me of m y c hildren 

at home and I m is s  them s o.  May
 
I take her pic tur e?"  And s aid
 
yeah.  So he took  my pic ture
.  And 
that's  the photo you s aw of me, age 3, with a wreath over  m y head, the s hoes  that were too big.  That 

was  the only pic ture I have of me pre
 
to the war, during the war . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about your grandfather returning to the bunker . 
 
>> Jul
ie Keefer:  Then my grandfather cam e back  and thought, wow, ok , everybody's  going to be safe.  
You know, my two granddaughters ar e s afe.  I have to c heck  on my daughter and her hus band and the 

other people in the bunk er. 
 
It was  night.  He met another man who had als o left the bunker  to join the 
r es is tanc e.  He and this other man went to s tay with Mr .
 
Berec zki
, or his barn, until m or ning s o they 
c ould find the bunker and s ee what was  going on.  In the mor ning they got to the bunker and they saw 

ever ything was  all as under .  There wer e dead bodies .  And 
Dziadz ia 
was  s ure that it was  the gr enades  
that they had that had exploded.  And then he and the other  m an s aw the bullet wounds  in eac h of the 

bodies . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Inc luding your m other and father.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Inc luding my m other  and father.  He and the other  m an buried everyone bac
k at this 
huge bunker
 
and s aid K
addish, whic h is  the Jewish prayer  for the dead
 a
nd then r etur ned.  This  was  in 
A pr il
 
1944.  In J une or J uly of 1944, the Rus s ians  c ame and the war  was  over for us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The war is  over.  You're liberated.  Tell us , one, how did the
 
Rus s ians  treat you, tr eat 
your  gr andfather, now that they were in control.  And I want you to tell us  about Tola. 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  The Rus s ians  at that tim e were very, ver y kind to c onc entration c amp s urvivor s , wh
ic h 

m eant that grand
pop c ould get an apartment, for exam ple.  He c ould get to the front of the line or 
whatever  for  food.  They were ver y kind at that point.  And we s aw them  as our liber ators , at that point.  
Bec aus e things c hanged
 b
ut not yet. 
 
 
You wanted to hear about Tola.  Tola was  plac ed in this orphanage.  The orphanage was  on 
P olinow 
S
tr eet
 
[phonetic ]
.  We tr ied to find the building. What had happened was  the orphanage
, 
a part 
of the r oof was  bombed.  So the c hildren and the nuns  wer e moved to another plac e, 
K or yc in
, which 
was  kind of like a s pa, a vac ation s pot.  Then my grandfather went there to look  for her  and s aw the 

c ar etaker who s aid, "I'm  s or ry, Mr .
 
E is en
.  You're about four m onths too late.  The c hildr en wer e 
m oved."  And he s aid, "Wher e?"  One s tory, one half of them s uppos edly
 
were taken to Hungar y.  And 
the other half wer e taken to Switzerland or  Germ any or Fr anc e.  So he went to all of thos e plac es and 

nothing.  You c ould not get into Hungary at that tim e
 a
t all.  The Rus s ians  had it abs olutely loc ked 
down.
  
So we never  found
 
m y s is ter. We looked for her for year s  and years .  
 
 
When I was  in the c hildren's  hom e wher e I was
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In Cleveland.
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  In Cleveland, Ohio.  My s oc ial worker c am e to me and brought m e a black and white 

pic ture of a gir l who
 
was  about two year s  younger than me, with a big, white bow on her hair , and kind 
of the dream y, light eyes  of my father, and s aid "The Red Cr oss  think s  this  is  your s is ter."  So I was  

ec s tatic bec aus e I thought, wow, m y s is ter.  I really wanted her .  So I
 
took  that picture and that went 
ever y wher e with m e.  And then two weeks  later
 
--
 
no.  Then the s oc ial worker took m e to the hos pital to 
have blood tes ts.  Two weeks later s he c alled me into her offic e and s aid, "J ulia, I'm s orry.  Th
is  c hild is  

not your  s

The blood does  not m atc h."  And we never found her.

> > Julie Keefer:  My gr andfather  had

I don't know what he had done but he had quite a bit of m oney.  
He offered to pay Luc ia all of it for  s aving our lives .  She s aid
, ﬁ
Look, we'v e been a fam ily.  I want to

ﬂ  
At one of the DP c am ps we went to, Lucia was  told that s he had to 
c onvert.  And in or der  to c onvert, s he had to go in the r itual Bat Mitzvah and s he had to s have her 
head.  So Luc ia went up to Aizik and s aid, "Aizik, I have s o little hair to begin with.  I don't want to do 
this ."  So Aizik, who c ould be very im pos ing, went up to this  little tiny r abbi and s aid, "Rabbi, this  
woman is  m or e prec ious  than diamonds .  That s he wants  to be a J ew is  an honor to all J ews .  I don't 
want anything to stand in her way."  Ok , Aizik, s he won't s have her head, all r ight, all right.  So they got 

m arried.  And s he didn't s have her head.

gr andpa s

> > Bill Bens on:  J ulie, you have s o muc h more that you c ould tell us .  I wis h we c ould s pend s ever al 
hour s  with you but we c an't.  You've had to skip over  m any, m any details .  In the little time we have left, 
tell us  a little bit about the trip that you and Larr y took  back  to the Lwow.  It was  a very pr ofound tr i
p for  
you.  Share just a little of that with us, if you could. 
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  Well, firs t I have to tell you that for many, m any year s  I was  not willing to s hare my 

experienc es.  It was  too painful.  And people really didn't want to hear it for most of
 
m y youth.  And then 
I got c aught up in life and living and mar riage and work  and c hildr en and life went on.  But when I got 

older  and I r etir ed, I dec ided I wanted to go back  to L
wow
 
to s ee what was  left of wher e I was  bor n, 
wher e I was  hidden, wher e my sis ter was , above all, anything about my s is ter. 
 
 
So my hus band Larr y, who was  unbelievably s uppor tive and planned the whole thing, got us  a 
guide and an ar chivis t who was  fabulous , Alex.  We took gr andpa's diary, s elec ted s ites we wanted to 
s ee; for exam p
le, where his  hous e was  in the ghetto.  Now ther e is a gas station there.  But the r es t of 
the ghetto is  standing.  Where the J anows ka was .  It is s till s tanding but as  a Uk r ainian pris on.  The 
Rus s ians  m ade it a pris on.  Wanted to s ee J ak torow, the fir s t labor c amp he was  in.  It is  now 
appr opriately c alled an ins ane as ylum.
 

>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > J ulie Keefer:  And then we went to s ee the m emor ial to the ghetto.  We went to tr y to find the hous e 

wher e m y s is ter was  fir st hidden as  a Catholic  c hild.
 
 
By the way,
 
Alex got us a news paper r epor ter who wrote a long s tor y, in Uk r ainian, whic h I 
c an't read, about my tr ying to find m y s is ter and did anyone know.  
 
 
It was  a very inter es ting trip.  Ther e wer e s igns  of anti
-
Semitism still.  But ther e wer e hum an 
touc hes  th
at wer e unbelievable.  For example, we went to vis it J anows ka.  You c ould not go in becaus e 

it's  a wor king pr is on.  You c ouldn't even take pictur es  ins ide.  But on the side of the r oad, ther e is  a s ign 
c om m em orating Janowska and a huge r ock , eight tons  becaus e Dr.
 
Sc hwar tz, who m ade that m emorial 
and who had been one of the s urvivor s  of J anows ka, dec ided eight tons, no one c ould take it away so 

eas ily.  So ther e it was . 
 
 
As  we were s tanding in this  little abutment with a bright blue benc h, ther e was  an old
, old m an 
wear ing fingerles s gloves and a c ap and hunc hed into a c oat, s weeping leaves  with one of thes e twig

do unto you,ﬂ

hris tian

Hurt not others  with that whic h pains  your s elf,
ﬂ  
Buddhist wis dom.  "Do not do unto others  
what you would not have them do unto you," J ewis h wis dom.  "Do unto all men as you would wis h to 

have done unto you," and "Rejec t for other s what you would r ejec t for  your s elf," Is lam ic wis dom .  And 
finally, "This  is the s um of all true r ighteous nes s .  Treat others as thou would thys elf be tr eated.  Do 
nothing to thy neighbor whic h here after  thou would not have thy neighbor  do to the," Hindu wis dom.
 
 
Why do we all not prac tice this ?  Som e people have pr ac tic ed this  in my life.  I know of two 
hum ble Pols  who did fight agains t injustic e and bigotr y by s aving the lives  of m y grandfather and me.  

One is Luc ia Nowic ka, now 
E
is en, whos e name is  on the wall of the righteous  am ongs t nations.  You 
c an s ee her  nam e there.  The other is  Stanis laus 
Berec zki
.  Unfortunately his  nam e is  not c urr ently 
lis ted am ongst the r ighteous.  
 
 
We're all one family, the fam ily of human kind.  What hur ts one of 
us  harms  all of us .  But it's 
not enough to s har e this  belief. We m ust als o fight agains t injustic e and bigotr y indiv idually and 
c ollec tively.  We must never  s tand by as s ilent onlooker s , as ac ts of cr uelty oc c ur befor e our eyes .  We
