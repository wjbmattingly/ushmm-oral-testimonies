father was an attorney, my  mo ther wa

before wash ing machines and dryer. And my

 someone there with me. The last one I

A: You know, I really don™t know. I re
ally don™t know because a-as people 
probably know, wh
en you lived in 
Vienna 
in the thir -- in the 
30™s, you considered 
yourself Viennese befo re you co nsidered yo
urself Jewish. We lived across the street 
from the Temple, and there was no separatio
n of church and state, and so  wh en I 
went to school -- excuse me -- we had re
ligion in the school. And the Catholic kids 
went on one floor and the Pr
otestant kids went on anothe
r and the Jewish kids went 
upstairs. And I remember I had a teacher and her name was Mrs. 
Wolfe
 and she 
always told us we shouldn™t be afraid of her because her name was
 Wolfe.
 
Q: Was she a Jewish teacher? 

A: I believe so. But we had cards, I s
till have one, with ma -- a picture of 
Mo ses
 on 
it and we had to get the cards punched wh en
 we went to servic
es every Saturday. 
That was like, you 
know, our homework. 
Q: How religious was your family a
nd how affiliated Jew ishly were they? 
A: Well, we belonged to th
e Temp le. You know, you -- in 
Vienna
 at that time you 
were taxed according to -- through -- thro
ugh the Temple, because the Temple had 
to send in lists of who was a me mber. That
™s why it was so easy, you know, for the 
Nazis, and you were taxed acco
rding to that affiliation. 
Q: And you said -- so you obviously  went to
 a -- what we call a public school today. 
A: Yes.

Q: And wh-what age did you start? 
A: I -- there was no kinderg arten in 
Vienna 
at that time and I went to a private 
kindergarten  and my  teacher was Miss 
Sophie
 and she taught me French be -- and 
then, when we were going to
 emigrate, my  mother asked her to give me English 
lessons, but the only English lessons she ga
ve me were nursery rhymes. I was very 
good on 
Humpty Dumpty
, that was one of 
my specialties. 
Q: What language did you speak at home? 

A: German. Viennese German. 
Q: Did you know any Yiddish? 

A: No, no. Nobody in my
 family spoke Yiddish. 
Q: Did you celebrate 
a ny Jewish holidays? 

A: Yes, we c-celebrate, especially with
 my mother™s father. We usually had 
Seder 
at my  grandparents, I reme mb er that, and I have a German Hebrew  
Haggadah
, 
which I still have. And that was 
about all I remember. N o w, in 
Vienna
 at that time, 
I had a Christmas tree. My parents, at 
a -- there was no, you know, there was no 
discussion about it. Every kid I knew wh
o was Jewish had a Christmas tree,  the 
Christmas tree was for me and the maid. It wa
s like, that™s what you did at that time 
and I got th -- we didn™t have stockings or
 anything like that, but I got my  presents 

under the tree. That was a Viennese tradition.

Q: So th ere was no discussion of 
what the holiday 
really meant? 
A: You mean Christmas? 
Q: Chri-Chris -- Christian-wise. 
A: No, no. It was just, you know, I mean, 
i-it™s contrary to here wh ere, you know, 
you make a big deal out of 
Hanukkah
 because you don™t want the kids to feel 
inferior. Everybody I knew got 
their presents at Christmas. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And what about frien
ds? Did you have no
n-Jewish friends 
also? 

A: Most of my friends were -- I think a
ll my friends were Jewish, I think. I-I -- I 
still have a very good friend who lives in 
New Jersey 
and sh e and I went to 
kindergarten  together and we™ve kept up all these years. 

Q: Did you observe 
Sha bba t
? 
A: No. 

Q: And wh-what -- 
Kashrut? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 
[indecipherable]
. Did you feel Jewish ? 
A: Not particularly. Not particularly. I 
mean, I -- there was no problem about, you 
know, kids going to  different places for thei
r religion. I mean, I never felt that I was 

better, worse, inferior or anything like th
at. It was just a fact, you know? I wa -- I

knew I was Jewish. You have to remember, 
I was eight years old when I left, so  
from the time I was si
x to the time I was eight, that -- those were the only years that 
I wa -- I was in -- i-in school. By the wa
y, I-I was a very protected child, I never 
went to school by my self. There were no sc
h oo l bu ses, my  mo th er walk ed  me to  
school every day. Sh e walked me home t -- for lunch, she walked me back from 
lunch, she picked me up ag ain, a-and so on. So -- 

Q: So even thou
gh you were -- obviously you were 
quite young when you left, you 
-- you were not that independent as a very young child. 

A: Not at all, not at all. As a matter of fact there was a grocery store I remember, 

very close to my  house and I was never a
llowed to go there by myself. I -- it was 
just -- you know, it never came up. And th en when
 Hitler
 marched into 
Austria
 in -
- I think it was March third, ™38, my moth
er took me out of school. Now, I don™t 
know wh ether she had to take me out of 
school, whether she wanted to protect me 
to -- you know, and so on. And that™s wh
en I started those English lessons with 
H um p ty  Du mp ty . 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So up 
-- up to the time of the 
anschluss
 you were leading a 
normal life -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and a child™s life.  

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
7
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: We™ll get to that point in a minute.  

A: Okay . 
Q: Did you have -- and again, you 
were very young, of course -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- did you have any other interests of 
hobbies or playing, or did you have any 
favorite toys? Anything like that that  you can describe, as a young child? 
A: I had a beautiful doll carriage. It was 
gray and it had windows and it had a roof 
that rolled -- you could roll up and it had 
blue curtains on the windows and wh en 
we were here for a few years,
 my  dad and I always used 
to  take walks, and one day 
we passed the -- we lived in an apartment on 
Riverside Drive
, and I passed the 
garbag e bin and there was my
 carriage. My mother did 
not ask me if she could 
throw it out, she just did it. And it -- I™ll ne
ver forget it. It was like the worst shock 
of my life. 

Q: What was her rationale for throwing it out? 
A: Well, at -- at that time 
my  grandmother and my  aunt and my  cousin, we were all 
living in  one apartment. And I guess she fi
gured, you know, I was old enough not to 
need the doll carriage.
 But again, I had -- my  granddaughter 
Lauren
 had 
interviewed me and I explained to her 
how -- you know, she 
asked me if I was 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004

scared when I had to come to 
America
, and I tried to explain to her -- she™s 15 now 
-- how in those days, in 1938, if you were a child in
 Vienna
, or at least in my 
family, if your parents said, we™re going to  
America
, which my mother did, I never 
questioned it. It was just, you know, that™s
 what you did. You didn™t say, oh I™m 
sorry I™m not going, or I™m 
sorry, I™m staying w
ith a friend or -- or anything like 
that. It was just a very different time. A
nd my  mo ther always did say, cause sh -- I 
think she wanted to paint it 
as black as possible, that we were going to live in a 
basement. And I was such a naïve kid that 
wh en we got here and we didn™t live in a 
basement, I said, how come we™re not liv
ing in  a basement? But you have to 
reme mb er, I was eight years old, it was 1938, that™s the way it was.  
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: My parents were actually really wonde
rful in retrospect, because I -- I really 
never was scared. I know we didn™t have a 
lot of money, in retrospect, but I never 
had the feeling that
 A
, I was going to starve, 
B
, I was poor, 
C,
 I wouldn™t have 
enough clothes. I never had that feeling, so
 they -- they must ha
ve just been very 
positive people to convey 
that message to me. 
Q: How old were -- were you when
 you first heard of man named
 Hitler
? 
A: Well, I remember v ery cl
early. It was the President 
Schuschnigg,
 was his name, 
in 
Vienna
, when he abdicated, and I rememb er
 everybody sitting in our living room

and my  mother crying. So it mu st have 
been very shortly, y
ou know, before th e 
anschluss
. So I was -- I was eight. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh at are your memo ries of the 
anschluss
? 
A: Well, my mother took me out of school
. She didn™t really explain it too much, 
but I think all my -- my three best friends 
also, you know, couldn™t go to school any 
more. But, I mean, they didn'
t tell us that anything horrible was going to  happen to 
us if we continued to go to  school or anyt
hing like that. Again, it was this naiveté, 
you know, of your mo th er 
says you™re not going to  sc
hool, you™re going to have 
English lessons cause you™re going to 
America
. You know, that™s how it was. 
Q: So you and your
 friends, did you talk about that -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- at that time? 

A: No. I think we must have talked ab
out, you know, who was leaving first and -- 
and -- and those kind of things, 
but I -- I really don™t remember. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm -hm. And so then  your -- your
 mo th er started to prepare and your 
father started to prepare to leave? 

A: Right, well -- 
Q: What -- do you know wh at they did? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
10
A: -- a very dramatic thing 
happened with my  dad, tha 
-- ma -- as I said, my dad 
was an attorney, but he worked  fo r my  
grandfather and he was like -- I don™t know 
how you called it in -- in German, but he wa
s the attorney at the -- at the office, 
because my grandfather™s office w as in 
Vienna
, and the factory, the leather factory 
was in 
Poland
. And -- 
Q: What -- what -- where in 
Poland
, do you know? 
A: In
 Warsaw. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And not many people know 
this, but before the Nazis 
started to wear swastik as, 
they wo re blue carnations. And the acc
ountan t in my  dad™s office wore a blue 
carnation. And after the 
anschluss
 he had a gun and went 
into my  grandfather™s 
office and said, this office is mine now.
 He didn™t shoot my  grandfather. But my  
father, who was, you know, young, saw the 
writing on the wall. And the people who 
gave us our affidavit were customers of his in 
America
, who are not Jewish and 
saved our lives. 

Q: O-Okay, let™s talk ab
out that, the -- the pe -- 
A: Okay . 
Q: Yeah, if you could go in more detail. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

11
A: Sure. Well, their name was 
Simon
, 
Helen 
and 
Leroy Simon
, they lived in 
Abington, Pennsylvania
. And they gave my  parents and me our affidavit so we 
could come to the 
United States
. 
Q: And how did they
 get contacted? 
A: I guess my  father cabled them or called them or -- you know, somehow. Mr.
 
Simon
 used to come to purchase leather, you
 know, from my grandfather. So that™s 
how my  father knew him, but only very slightly. 

Q: What was the name  of your grandfather™s comp any -- business. 
A: 
Emil Koernig
 and son.  
Q: 
Emil Koernig
 and s -- 
A: 
Koernig
 and 
sohn
 really, and i-it means 
Emil Koernig
 and son. 
Q: -- and son. So th en your father
 was able to -- this is after the 
anschluss
, he -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- ca-cables the 
Simons -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- in the 
United States
, and then they send the affidavits. 
A: Right. 
Q :  A n d  th en  wh at h a pp en ed ? 
A: Well, we didn™t -- we left 
Vienna
 in September of that year.

12
Q: Okay, okay. What was -- 
again we™ll -- we™ll -- we™ll talk about that soon. 
A: Sure. 
Q: Did you see German soldiers?  
A: I don™t remember. I don™t remember. 
Q: Did you see any swastikas? 

A: I mu st have, but again, you know, I -- I don™t remember that. 

Q: Or banners, or any outward symbols? 
A: I mean, I™ve seen -- I™ve s
een a lot of movies, you know, about that time, but I -- 
I -- I don™t reme mb er, I -- I really don™t. I me an, I -- I never remember being afraid, 
I-I know that. And there must have been s
ituations, you know, that came up, but I 
don™t rem -- know. 
Q: So except for school -- 

A: Mm. 

Q: -- not going to school -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- your life -- I mean, that was a big chan
ge, of course, but in other aspects your 
life did not change in da -- 
A: My life just continued. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
13
Q: -- continued. Tell me about your priv
ate lessons then, when you didn™t go to 
school. 
A: Oh, well I think either Miss 
Sophie
 came to our house or I went to her house. 
And, you know, she had like picture books 
in -- in English and so on. I was an 
English as a second language teacher, a
nd you know, wh at comes around goes 
around, and she tried to teach me E nglish. 

Q: Was that some -- 
A: She helped my French 
too, at the same time. 
Q: Was that something you enjoyed doing? 
A: No, I didn't particu larly like it because I 
really preferred going to school. I didn™t 
really like, you know, one to
 one so much becau
se y-you always had to show your 
homework and, you know, things like that. 

Q: Were you upset that you were
n™t seeing your friends, or did -- 
A: I saw my fr -- 
Q: -- you see your non-Jewish friends after school? 
A: I don™t think I had any non-Jewish fri
ends, so, you know, we just kept up, you 
know, in th -- in those days it was before
 television, before a lot of movies, you 
know. Seeing your friends meant you went 
to your friend™s house or they came to 

your house, and that -- that kept up. And 
I™m sure in my  house and their house there 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004

was a lot of talk about emigration and wh ere were you going and wh at were you 
doing, but I wasn™t part of th
at, I was a child, you know.  
Q: Uh-huh. So wh en  you played  with your 
friends, you didn™t talk about th -- being 
fearful or being frightened ab out what would happen? 

A: No, no, I -- it-it™s like 
that™s all gone. So I -- I guess it didn™t make a big 
impression on me, or I was too stupid, or so mething, I don™t know. 

Q: I think you 
were young. 
A: Right. 

Q: So to  get back now to wh at was happe
ning. So  your father cabled these people, 

they got the affidavits -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- and then? 

A: Well, we left in September and we went to 
Cherbourg
, which is in 
France -- 
Q: Wh-When you left, you said you -- you -- 
you didn™t question, 
your parents told 
you that™s what you do. 

A: Right. 

Q: What did you take with you? 
A: Oh. Well, my  clothes and my  doll, wh
ich I still have. And my doll carriage,

which my mother threw out, 
and books. I ha -- I have so
me German  books that I -- I 
took at that time. 
Q: Is that because 
you liked to read? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. Maybe my mother said, 
you know, you™ll need some books to 
read on the ship, I don™t 
know. But my mother -- 
Q: What -- wh-w hat was it like to say goodbye to your friends? 
A: I don™t think it was very traumatic beca
use I presumed I would see them again. 
As far as I know everybody, you k
now, escaped. No t necessarily to 
America
, but 
they all escaped. And -- so anyway, gettin
g back to the ship
. So we went to 
Cherbourg. 
Q: How -- how did you get there? 
A: I think by train, because
 I remember my grandparents
 being at the station and 
that was very sad and I -- I still had two gr
eat-grandmothers at th
at time, who were 
killed in the camps, so  a -- we never really
 heard through the Red Cross or anything, 
what ever happened to them. 

Q: Do you remember what 
your grandparents said -- sa
id to you as you left? 
A: Well, everybody was crying, that I d 
-- I do remember, and lots of hugs and 
kisses, and so on and so forth. My grandfather died shortly after
 Hitler
 ca me, my  
father™s father. And my  grandmother moved into a 
pensio nne
, like a -- like a -- kind

of a hotel. And she and my  uncle ev-eventually, you know, came to 
America
 and 
she lived with us all of the rest of her 
days. And my mother™s parents -- my uncle 
had been sent to school before 
Hitler
 came to 
England
 and he was in 
England
 and 
he managed to get them to 
England
 after 
Hitler
. And they were there the whole 
time during the bombing, which was very 
bad for them. My gran dmother had a 
stroke and so on. But eventu
ally they did come to the 
United States
.  
Q: While you were still in 
Vienna
, what did 
Hitler
 mean to you? Did it have 
photographs, or was it a symbol of anything? 

A: I -- I don™t have any recollection of th
at, I-I just don™t. I guess at eight I didn™t 
read the newspapers, you know. There wa
s no television. My parents probably 
turned off the news, you 
know, so I -- I really -- 
Q: I was going to ask if you heard his voice on the radio. 

A: No, I -- I don™t believe so. I-I me
an, as I said, I remember shu -- 
Schuschnigg, 
you know, I reme mb er that, but 
I don™t rememb er anything about
 Hitler
. I know 
that -- I don™t know who taught me that, but to
 this day, if I see a movie or anything 
that has 
Hitler
 on it, we -- we all go 
ssssss
, like that. And I s
till do that, even on -- 
at home, in a -- in a -- you know, on my  te
levision. That was sort of ingrained in 
me.

Q: Uh-huh. So you take the train. Di
d you -- did you feel
 bad about leaving 
Vienna
? I mean, this is your home. 
A: No, I was with my parents. We were
 going on a trip, I -- you know, it -- it w as -- 
it was okay.
 Cherbourg
, you know, was in 
France
, I could speak French so I 
didn™t -- I didn™t really worry about it.  
Q: Ha-Had you gone away in th e 
summers? Had you ta-taken coun -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- country trips when you -- before you left? 
A: Yes, I have pictures of my  cousin 
and I going with my  gran dparents, you know, 
to a place where there were a lot of deer. 
And I learned to swim when I was very 
young and I know th at we went to 
Baden
. And I was three when I learned how to 
swim and I still like to swim. So -- I forgot, where were we? 

Q: Well, it we -- we were talk
ing about your leaving, going to  
France -- 
A: Oh 
Q: -- and I was asking if
 you had experience -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- traveling outside of 
Vienna
. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And my  grandfather had a 
car with a chauffeur, so I was used to, 

you know, being in a car, so 
I -- I don™t know if we took the car to the train or, you

know, whatever. But anyw
ay, when we got to 
Cherbourg
, we got on the ship, the 
Euro pa
 and -- 
Q: Now we™re talking about th -- September 1938? 
A: Yes, yes. And it all seemed very glamor
ous to me and so on and so  forth. And a 
few days out to sea, it was the time of 
Chamberlain,
 wh en  
Chamberlain
 went to 
Hitler
 to try to appease him, they r
ecalled the ship. And of course -- 
Q: This was the 
Munich 
conference in mu -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- in 
Munich. 
A: Right. So, I mean, I didn™t know an
ything about wh at was going on and I™m sure 
my parents were really scared, but they didn
™t convey that to me
 and my father just 
told me that we were going back to 
Paris
. And I was thrilled because I could speak 
French, an d -- you know. So we were in 
Paris
 for a week and I™m sure that must 
have been very difficult for 
my  parents cause they didn
™t know, you know, whether 
they™d ever be able to 
leave again, but we did. 
Q: Tell me about the ship
, the name of the ship. 
A: 
Euro pa
. 
Q: And what line? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

19
A: German. And we were able to go first 
class because you couldn™t take out a lot 
of money, but you could buy 
first class tickets. So we 
had a very nice stateroom, 
and you know, all that. 
Q: What did your parents ta
ke with them, do you know? 
A: Well, my parents packed their furniture
 and the piano and all that in wh at was 
called a lift. It was like a cargo container. And that came -- 

Q: On th e boat with you? 
A: I™m not sure, but it was there when we settled, finally. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so anyway, after a week in 
Paris
, the ship continued -- 
Q: Wa -- do you remember th
at week and what you did? 
A: Not really. I guess we walked  around. Yo
u know, we didn™t have a lot of money, 
so I remember being like in a café, you know,
 my  parents drinking coffee, that kind 
of stuff, but I do -- I don™t rea lly remember wh
ere we stayed. 
Q: Di-Did you sense any te
nsion among th e people in 
France
 at that point? 
A: No, no. Pa -- I think it rain
ed a lot. I sort of reme -- I sort of remember that. And 
anyway, getting back  on the ship and it wa
s in the middle of the night, I rememb er 
that, and we had to climb up ropes to ge
t on th e ship, there was no gangplank. And 
when the ship started to sail the next day,  I got very sick. I probably had like a strep

throat. It was before penicillin and my mo
ther kept saying to  me, you have to  get 
well, or we have to go to 
Ellis Island
 and we can™t get to 
America
. Then, I think 
she was really, you know, like petrified. 
An d  I reme mb er th ere was a wo man  on  th e 
ship, she was probably a nurse, and she -- 
you know, in retrospect she was like 
Brunhilda
. She was very big an d very blonde and had a very loud voice. And the 
way they treated, you know, fevers at that tim
e was to wrap you up 
in lots of towels 
and make you sweat. So  that™s what I did,
 and thank God I got 
well, and we didn™t 
have to go to l -- 
Ellis Island
, and we landed, I think in  -- probably  lower
 New 
York. 
And my  dad™s very good friend and la
ter his business partner met us. And I 
reme mb er h e  b ro ugh t me so me 
Coca-Cola
 and I didn™t know what it was and I 
didn™t want to drink it. It was 
a big deal. Anyway, we lived in 
New Jersey. 
Q: Okay , let™s talk a little bit about ma 
-- the voyage, what you rememb er about the 
voyage. 

A: Well, just I was sick and I had to sweat and I had to get well. 
Q: So were -- di -- were there other people 
in your position leaving, Jews leaving on 
that same voyage? 
A: I imagine there were, because my husband
, whom I didn™t meet
 til ni -- til 1947, 
came on the next voyage on the same ship. 
And he an d his mo ther were waiting fo r 
the ship and it was so late
 because they didn™t tell 
them that it had returned.

Q: So you™re assuming that
 there were people on -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- in your -- in your journey. 
A: I mean, I was in bed. I was in bed sw
eating so  I -- you know, I didn™t know wh at 
was going on. 
Q: What condition were you in when you la
nded, were you cured, were you better?  
A: I was probably a little 
shvakh
 and pale, you know? An
d my  granddaughter, who 
did this interview for school for me made
 up a story that my  mo ther probably  took 
her lipstick and ro uged my  
cheeks so that I would -- you  know, look -- look all 
right. 
Q: What did 
America 
mean to an eight year old from 
Vienna
? 
A: Well, my mother said we were going to
 live in a basement. I knew I was going to  
have a birthday soon. I was looking forw
ard to my birthday. My mother was a 
wonderful Viennese baker and as it turned 
out, my  first birthday -- we landed here 
on October third, my  nint
h birthday was October 29
th
, and we lived in this rooming 
house in 
Union City, New Jersey
 and my  birthday present was two blue plastic 
barrettes. A nd I thought that was the cat™s meow, I was thrilled. My mother, I don™t 

know where she got all the ingredients, 
but she made me a beautiful cake with 
candles and everything. And my  dad™s fri
end and his wife lived in this same

board ing house. So  they all sang ﬁ
Ha ppy  Birthday
ﬂ, I don™t know whether it was 
in English or German, but that was my
 first birthday. An
d I went to the 
Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt 
elementary school. And th ere the kids made fun of me because I 
really had the wrong clothes. In those days
 I -- I h -- I had, you know, German high 
shoes. Now, you know, they™re in style, but
 in those days -- so after a few weeks, I 
don™t know, my  mo ther managed to sc
rape up some money and bought me 
American clothes, cause that was really important to me. 

Q: What were your parents reactions? Do you
 have any memory of that when  they 
landed, an d the dock? 
A: No, I just remember the 
Coca-Cola. 
Q: So have you studied about 
America
 before? Did it have any symbolic meaning 
to you as a ve
ry young child? 
A: No, I think I mu st have realized it wa
s a safe place, you know? But other than 
that I really didn™t know anything. But it di
dn™t take me very long to learn English, 
and I always did very  well in school, 
and I o -- never had any trouble making 

friends, so -- you know, I had friends. I ha
d the language. And when  we moved to 
New York
 wa -- a short time later, a few m
onths later, there were many other 
refugee kids, because we lived in 
Washington Heights,
 which -- in 
New York, 
which was sort of refugee land. And th en my grandmother came, my uncle came. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

And it was very hard fo r my  dad to star
t bi -- his busin ess because you know, you 
weren™t allowed to take out a lot of mone
y. Fo rtunately my  grandfather had some 
connecti -- he was a doctor and he
 had some connection with the 
Phoenix
 In su ran c e 
Comp any. And somehow my  dad was able 
to obtain th e monetary death benefits 
after my  grandfather died in 
America .
 And that™s how he was able to start his 
business. It was
 Sopter 
Fabrics, it was an -- origina
lly an import - export business 
and then after the war it 
became a textile business. 
Q: So you stayed in 
New Jersey
 just for a few  months -- 
A: Few months. 
Q: -- you said, and then  you moved to 
Wa shin gton Heights. 
Why did you move to 
washingt -- or how -- why was that
 chosen as a place to live? 
A: Well, I guess that™s where a lot of ref
ugees lived, and maybe 
my parent™s friends 
knew other people, you know, who lived th
ere. And I remember we lived at 40 
Thayer Street
 and we had an  apartment. And 
then when my gr
andmother came, 
she and I shared a room. And a few years later we moved to 
Riverside Drive
 and 
we lived there a number of years beca
use eventually my aunt came from 
England
 
with my cousin and she liv
ed with us also. And -- 
Q: Wh-When you first came to the 
United States
, did you miss
 Vienna
? Did you 
think about it? Did you think 
you™d want to  go back th ere?

A: I do -- I -- I don™t rememb er mi ssing anyt
hing. I had my  pare
nts, you know, and 
I had my  school wo rk and I had friends, an
d I was eight years old, you know, and as 
I sa -- as I tell my  granddau
ghter now, being eight year
s old then  and being eight 
years old now is an entirely different story.
 I mean, you were -- I mean, at least in 
my circle o f -- of friends, I mean, we we
ren™t independent. We did as our parents 
told us, you know. If they™d say jump, we™d 
jump. If they said red, we™d say red. 
You know, that™s how we lived. 
Q: All right, now you™re in 
Washin gton Heights -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- and you attend a new school. 
A: Right. 
Q: So you had to ad
just, as the child -- 
A: Yes, you™re right. 

Q: -- to a new school and new friends. 
What was that like in the beginning? 
A: Well, there™s a funny story connected at it -- it was 
P.S. 152
 in  upper
 
Manhattan
. And I never did have a sense of 
direction, and I met this girl 
Agnes
 
and she showed me how to get from the fr
ont door to our cla
ssroom. And I was in 
that school -- I started school in 
New Jersey
 in 
3B
. At that time the grades were 
divided into  
A
 and 
B. 
And for the -- from the time, 
I-I g u ess until sixth grade, I

went the way 
Ag nes 
showed me, even thou
gh I knew there was a shorter way. But I 
was just one of those kids, I mean, you kno
w, somebody tells me what to do, so I -- 
I -- I just did it. But I had to relearn th
e way we did math, the way they set up 
division problems and mu
ltiplication problems in 
Europe
 and
 America
, that was 
different, so I had to learn that. But the ki
ds were very nice to me at that point, 
because I had the amer -- quote unquote, 
the American clothes, you know. And I 
could speak some English and they  -- they 
were just nice kids, you know. Like one 
showed me math and one 
showed me about the lunchroom. And so I don™t 
reme mb er, you know, having any trau
matic times. I had my best friend
 Toby
 who 
was a bridesmaid at my wedding and i-it was okay.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes

volunteer collection interview with 
Marianne Liebermann. 
This is tape number 
one, side
 B
, and you were talking about 
now that you™re living in 
Wa sh ing t on  
Heights 
and you were at school and getting ar
ound the school building and your 
friends. So you did 
feel accepted there? 
A: Mm. 
Q: And were there other children in your situation? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
26
A: I believe -- I believe there were. I know that my friend 
Gerda
 lived right close to 
me and we went to school together. And 
I heard about some other people wh o had 
come from 
Vienna
. They didn™t, you know, necessa
rily go to my  school. I do 
reme mb er t h en  wh en  
the war started and we all had to wear 
I.D.
 tag s. And we 
moved to  
Riverside Drive
 from 
Thayer
 
Street
, and -- 
Q: Now, we™re talking about Septem
ber ™39, is that when the war -- 
A: Yes. Yes. 
Q: -- started in -- yeah. Wha-What did your 
I.D.
 tag say? 
A: It had my  name, my  date of birth 
and maybe my  phone number, I™m not sure. 
Q: Was this - all children had to wear them? 
A: All children, all children, because in cas
e there were air raids. A nd my parents -- 
now, we moved befo re I finished sixth gr
ade and my  parents wanted me to finish 
P.S. 152, 
so I had a very long walk home to 
Riverside Drive
 from 
P.S. 152. 
And in 
later years it -- it occurred to me 
that here we wore these tags for 
I. D.
 in case there 
was an air raid and there was a problem, but 
they sent us home. 
And here I was, you 
know, by this time nine years old, walkin g home in this so-called air raid which, 
thank God
 
was a test, but I -- I definitely remember that. 
Q: So did you talk ab out your ex perience
s, did you tell the American children about 
your life in 
Vienna
? Did they ask you about that, or
 did the teachers talk to you 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
27
about that? 
A: No, no. Not r -- not r -- not really. It wa
s just -- I was never 
very good in math, 
and so after my -- some of the kids s
howed  me, you know, ho
w to do the math, 
sometimes I would say, well you kn
ow, in my old school or in 
Vienna
 we did it like 
this. And the teacher would sa
y well, now you™re going to 
do it, you know, like that.  
Q: It -- did you feel very Viennese still , or were you starting to feel American? 

A: Oh, I think I got Americaniz
ed very quickly. My father 
had been  to school at the 
University of 
Lo ndon
, so he spoke a beautiful English with a very British accen t, 
which he lost after several 
years. So maybe that™s wh
y I, you know, was able to 
learn English quickly. But I -- I sort of liv
ed -- I know I did l -- a -- a bilingual life, 
because when my grandmother came -- she 
didn™t learn too much English when she 
came, and so when she -- sh
e™d come into the room I™d switch to German, and I 
didn™t even really realize which langua
ge I was speaking, but I was, you know, 
living in t -- in -- in two languages. 
Q: So you -- you felt very 
accepted, you didn™t feel like 
a foreigner, in a sense? 
A: No, no I didn™t, because there were ot
her children. I didn™t necessarily know 
them all in my school, but there we
re other children who had co me from 
Europe. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh at about the teachers? Did any of them make any remarks to 
you -- 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
28
A: Not to  me. 
Q: -- or any -- did you e
xperience any anti-Semitism? 

A: No, no, I really didn™t. 
Q: What was your parent™s reaction, if you
 remember, in September ™39? Again, I 
know you were young, you were only 10. 
A: When the war broke out? They were ve
ry worried about my 
mother™s parents. 
And I guess by that time they were in 
England
. And you know, the bombing and all 
that. And I™m sure my father had a lot of 
business difficulties, becau se as I said, he 
didn™t have that mu ch money and even
 though he had the money from my  
grandfather, it was still, you know, difficu
lt to establish a busin
ess at that time. 
Q: Were you able to do any ot
her activities outside of school? 
A: I was a girl scout and we used to ha
ve meetings with boy scout troops and I 
learned how to make model airplanes. And my  mo ther was always a very good 

cook and no matter, y ou know, whether we 
had a lot or a little, that we always had 
company at the house. So, you know, ther
e were always people around, and -- 
Q: Were these people Amer
ican born or European? 
A: No, they were -- they were also refuge
es like we were. And in the beginning, in 
order to help my father, my
 mo ther did piecew ork with her -- her friend. And also 
she made apple strudels, which she sold 
and I -- I vividly reme mb er her pulling the 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
29
dough in  the kitchen. And 
I don™t know how she sold 
it, where she sold it or 
whatever, but whatever 
you know, she did, she did that for awhile. 
Q: Mm-hm. Did you become athlet -- were 
you athletic in any ta -- any time and d -
- and do any sports? 
A: No, no, no, I was not an athlete.
 My parents had played tennis in 
Europe
 and 
also they skied, cause I have pictures of 
them when they were 
young and that -- but 
I guess at that time they were -- my fath
er was busy making a living and my  mo ther 
was busy, you know, helping and th en also
 once my  grandmother came, my  mo ther 

had to help her. And then wh en my  gran dp
arents came, my -- my
 -- my father™s 
mother lived with us 
Oma Hilda,
 and my  mother™s parents lived on the same floor 
as we did, in an -- in a
nother apartment. But unfortunately my  grandfather became 
very ill, he had 
Parkinson™s
, and so my mother really 
had to spend a lot of time, 
you know, taking care of him. 

Q: How old were your parents at this time? 
A: My mother was born in 1907 and my fa
ther was born in 1904. And my father 
always said -- that much I do
 reme mb er, that had he been
 older or richer, we would 
have never come to the 
United States
. H-He -- you know, it was -- a lot of his 
friends didn™t survive because they 
A
, didn™t know anybody to get an affidavit 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004

from, or have the guts to go. I me
an, now we know all the horrors of 
Hitler
, but 
then they  didn™t know. 
Q: What do you attribute 
your parent™s wise decisi
on to? When you say other 
people did not realize the danger. Wha -- 
how do you know -- wh-what would you 
think were the reasons that your parents did know? 

A: Well, one thing -- for one thing my fath
er had been, you know
, to school at the 
University of 
Lo ndon
, so he had -- he had trav eled
. And I guess it was a question of 
luck, that -- that somehow th
at -- my  dad saw the writing on the wall. And -- cause I 
know with my  husband™s pa
rents, my father-in-law wa
s a surgeon and his hospital 
privileges were taken away, so he had 
no means of support. And that™s, you know, 
why he left. 

Q: Was there any sense that you have that
 your mo ther was not
 in agreement with 
him about leaving, or
 was in agreement? 
A: Well, my mo ther also was one of thes
e European  ladies, you know, whatev er my  
father said, went. It was a different time, it was before, you know, wo men™s 

independence an-an-and all that. Th-Th-They  
-- I -- I never had the feeling that they 
ha -- or heard any arguments that 
they had about -- about leaving. 
Q: So th en comes Decemb er seventh and the bombing of 
Pearl Ha rbor
. Do you 
have any memo ries of that time? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
31
A: Well, I remember w h ere we were. We we
re going out to -- by that time my  aunt 
had remarried and we were i-in
 the car goi -- they lived in 
Far Ro ckaway. 
My 
uncle was an ear, nose and thro at su
rgeon and he -- he practiced in 
Far Ro ckaway
, 
and we were on the way to 
their house, or coming back
 from their house, I don™t 
reme mb er wh ich ,  wh en  
Pearl Harbor
 happened, and everybody was very upset. 
And then  we heard President
 Ro osev elt
, you know, say that we™re at war. And I 
reme mb er in school my  prin cipal crying. We -- we had assemb lies in those days 
with middy blouses and ties and I reme mb er we had th is assemb ly and sh e was 
crying. 

Q: And here you are, young
, y-young student and had liv
ed, you know, had escaped 
-- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- and did you -- were you particularly fearful when  that happened? 

A: No, no, because I -- I felt very Americ
an. I mean, this is my country and you 
know, this was ha -- this was happening to
 us. And my  uncle was drafted into the 
army, and he also lived with 
us for a short time, so we 
were very close to him and 
we were worried, you know, about him. A
nd I remember rationing books and that 
a-after awhile my  parents -- my  father a
nd his friend, I think together, I don™t know 
if you could do that today, but they  ow
ned the car together, cause they -- each one 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
32
couldn™t afford a car. And I remember, you 
know, the -- the gas rationing coupons, 
you know, for the cars.  
Q: And what was the communication betwee
n your parents and family or friends 
back in 
Europe
? 
A: Well, I think -- I think th at -- well, I know that my  parents wrote to my  

grandparents. You know, it was before the 
days of you know, you
 pick up the phone 
and call 
England
. And they ca -- my grandparents 
came, I -- I don™t know the exact 
date, but I know that they ca
me on a warship somehow, from 
Lo ndo n. 
And  my  
grandmother had had a stroke 
and it wasn™t diagnosed  and sh-she really wasn™t right 
any mo re. And as I said, my  grandfather had 
Parkinson™s
, so it was a difficult time 
for everybody. 

Q: What year did they come? 

A: Good question. I think it was after the wa
r broke out. It was ba -- either 1940 or 

™41.  
Q: So your life continued on
 as a young -- youngster -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- and you were in the girl scouts. 
A: Right. 
Q: And any other interests 
and hobbies and so forth? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
33
A: No, we -- we -- my father and I used to 
take a lot of walks. We -- we all walked a 
lot. And I remember -- 
Q: Did you -- did you speak in
 English to him or German? 
A: I don™t remember. Probably English, pr obably English, becau
se I remember this 
busin ess of my  grandmother would walk in
 and it was like subconscious, I™d switch 
to German, but I think to Daddy -- and in 
those days all the refugees I knew an d my  
family also, we were very careful not to 
sp eak German in the street. I mean, that 
was -- 

Q: Why? 

A: Because you didn™t want to be identifie
d as a German, you didn
™t want to be like 
an alien, you know. So on and so forth. An
d so i -- I-I™m sure I ta
lked to my father 
in English. And eventually I 
went to high school, I went to high school on -- on the
 
trolley car. I went to 
George Wa shington
 High School. And I gr
aduated and I went 
to 
Hunter College
 first for a semester and then I went to
 Syracuse University 
and 
then I went to 
Barnard
 and graduated, got marr -- 
no, got married, graduated and 
had my  daughter, all in one year. 

Q: As the war was going on in  the 40™s, in
 the early 40™s, how aware of yo -- o-of it 
were you as you were getti
ng older now? You were 12 - 13 - 14 and so forth. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
34
A: Well, I re -- I remember seeing i-in 
the windows of people who had servicemen 
in the armed forces, they had stars in th
e windows, you know, that. And -- oh, I -- I 
liked to hear the radi
o. My dad and I used to wat -- listen to 
ﬁThe Shadow
ﬂ and -- 
and programs like that, you kno
w. And I -- I know that™s 
what we liked to do. And 
my  grandmother taught me how to play gi
n rummy, so I played 
g i n  ru mmy  with  my  
friends. And I joined a 
B™nai Brith
 youth group. And I was the editor of the paper 
and made a lot of friends. And that was in the city, in 
Manhattan.
 So  I learned, you 
know, how to travel 
in the subway and -- and so on
. And at one point I was a copy 
girl for the ﬁ
Daily Newsﬂ. 
How th at ever happened I -- I don™t know, because as I 
was growing up, my mother still, you know
, was very protective of me. I always 
had to be in early at night and so on a
nd so forth. And the thought of me as a 
teenager being a copy girl for the ﬁ
Daily Newsﬂ
 on 
Times Square
, during the war, 
in the dark, is beyond me, but I did it. 
You know, I think it was through the girl 
scouts that we -- tha -- that we did that, ca
use they were -- you know, a lot of the 
boys were in the army  and somehow we
 were helping the war effort. And I 
remember saving tin foil. We used to make
 balls out of tin foil. I remember saving 

string, rubber bands, tin cans. You know, we
 -- we tried to do what we could. I 
remember my grandmother knitted sweaters 
for the Red Cross, 
for the soldiers. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

35
Q: Did your parents talk ab
out the plight of the Jews 
during th e war? Were they 
aware of some --  
A: No -- 
Q: -- what was happening? 
A: -- no, my  parents were still -- as old 
as I was, you know, as the years went by, 

very protective of me and didn™t -- didn™t
 talk very much ab
out it. I mean, I -- I 
knew, I heard on the radio, I read the pa
pers by then, you know
, what was -- I knew 
what was going on. But we didn™t have an
y very close relatives who were in the 
camps, so you know, as I said, my  father 
was busy, you know, making a living. At 
that point he was supporting us, my  gran
dparents, my  grandmother, my  au -- he 
gave my  uncle a job in his office. So, it was hard times.  
Q: When  you would see 
Hitler™s
 picture in newsreels or on -- in the paper, wha -- 
how did -- how did you react? 

A: Well, we did this 
sssssss 
business, you know. We ju  -- we just knew that he was 
evil and I don™t think we knew right away 
how horrible it was. It w asn™t until after 
the camps were liberated that -- that we
 learned, you know, 
how horrible it was. 
Whereas my  husband knew a lot mo re than I did, maybe because he was a boy, 
maybe because his -- you know
, most of his family was 
killed. But I really didn™t 
know too mu ch in the beginning.

Q: So tho-those years until ™45 -- 
A: Mm. 

Q: -- for you were not fearful times. 
A: No, not ne -- I mean, I -- you know, 
when -- when -- when
ever, you know, I 
reme mb er, you know, 
Guam
 and -- and all those, yo
u know, battles, I mean, you 
know, we -- we cheered when we won, we  were sad when -- when we lost. And I 
was always fascinated by 
Winston Churchill
, even as a -- as a teenager and I still 
am. I -- I just think he was one of the grea
test people that ever
 lived. And I foll -- I 
followed the news, you know, when 
Roosevelt
 and 
Stalin
 and -- and 
Churchill 
had 
the meetings and so on and so fo rth. 
And I eventually majored in diplomatic 
relations. I was going to be an interprete
r at th e United Nations. Then I met my 
husband and that was the end of th at. And I became a teacher. 

Q: What was the end of the wa
r like for you and your family? 

A: Oh, ev erybody was so ha
ppy, you know. My father wo
rked -- his office then was 
on 
40
th
 Street
, right near 
Times Square
 and you know, we heard all those stories 
and ag ain, it was before 
TV
. You know, it™s hard for kids
 today to realize that. But 
we -- you know, of course we were
 all very happy, and life went on. 
Q: And so by th e time the war 
was over you were what, 16? 
A: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

Q: So you were still in high school. 
A: Right. I was.  

Q: A-And th en you continue
d on to college, you said? 
A: Right.  

Q: And -- and -- and you studied in terna 
-- did you say international relations? 
A: Right, right, right. I went to the 
Maxwell House 
of -- 
School of Citizenship
 and 
I also met my husband when I was 17. I 
didn™t know he was going to be my 
husband wh en I was 17. 

Q: How -- how did you meet him? 

A: We were on vacation, my  pare
nts and my  grandmother and I in 
Lake Placid
 and 
we stayed in the same hotel and we were 
the only two people under 40 at that hotel. 
And we spen t -- we wasted several days of 
I looking at his table, he looking at my 
table and nobody said anything. And fina
lly our two fathers got together and 
decided, you know, to end th
is torture. And well, we sp
ent, you know, a few days 
together. And my father a
nd I would go horseback ridi
ng every morning and the 
morning that 
Frank
 left my dad was thrown from the horse. And 
Frank
 and I had 
decided th at we were going to write to 
each other and I wrote him that my  dad was 
okay, but he had a concussion and I had to 
go back to school with my  grandmother 
and they  stayed at the hospital, you know.
 But he -- he was okay. But I was pretty 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

scared and I wrote to 
Frank
 and he wrote back and he
 signed the letter love, and 
that was the beginning of the end.  
Q: And wher -- and wh ere was he at school?  
A: He was going to  
Western Reserve
 and I was going to  
Sy ra cuse
 and he used to 
toodle back and forth a lot. But those we
re the days of cu rfews and house mo thers 
and fraternities and -- it was a different world. 
Q: Mm-hm. And -- and then wh en did you get married? 
A: We got married November 23
rd
, 1950, and we lived in 
Kew Gard ens, New 
York, 
and th en we moved to 
Great Neck
 and then we moved here.  
Q: Mm-hm. And your children? 

A: Well, we have three children. My daughter 
Joan, Joanie
 and my  daughter 
Nancy 
and my  son 
Jerry. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And we have fi
ve grandchildren. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh en you met 
Frank Liebermann
, you had similar backgrounds 
in a sense, both coming from 
Euro pe
, and you said traveling on the same boat, 
another voyage later. 
A: Right, but we -- 
Q: Di-Did you talk about with
 him th-the feelings of being a refugee and so fo rth? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
39
A: No, no, but I know that 
Frank™s 
tol -- 
Frank
 told me then that 
I was the first girl 
from 
Europe
 that he had ever dated, because I guess in 
Dayton
,
 Oh io
 there weren™t 
that many refugee kids. 
Q: Did you feel a connection because of 
that refugee status that you both had? 
A: I don™t know, but our parents did beca
use our parents were 
lifelong friends, even 
though my in-l
aws lived in 
Oh io ,
 my parents lived in 
Kew Gardens.  
Q: But they met at that 
Lake Placid ? 
A: At that hotel, yeah
, yeah. The chalet.  
Q: Did you speak 
in English with 
Frank
 in the beginning or German? 
A: English. We always spok
e English until our kids were
 born and then one day we 
decided maybe they should learn a little German. And 
Frank
 and I discovered th at 
we spoke an entirely different language
. That the German they sp eak in 
Vien na
 is 
not the German that he spoke. And then
, of course, the kids learned all those 
phrases about going to bed a
nd, you know, all the things that kids at that time 
shouldn™t know.  

Q: So th en you -- you star
ted raising your children. 
A: Right. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
40
Q: And then  even tually you moved down he
re. Let™s now talk a little bit about your 
feelings of what you had gone th rough. 
Do  you th ink today th
at you would be a 
different person if you hadn™t had the ch
ildhood -- the early childhood th at you had? 
A: Well, my husband always 
said that it hadn't been for 
Hitler
, 
A
, we wouldn™t 
have met and 
B
, that our lives are much
 richer living here.  
Q: Da -- do you feel that way, and if 
so how do -- what do
 you mean by that? 
A: Well, I don™t know what our lives wo
uld have been like. I mean, we -- the 
chances of 
Frank
 and I meeting were nil.
 You know, he lived in 
Upper Silesia
, I 
lived in 
Vien na
. Unless his family took a trip, I me
an th -- I -- th-there was -- th ere 
-- probably we -- we just wouldn™t have 
met and we probably, you know, would 
have married different people and had di
fferent interests and children and so on. 
Q: When your children were 
the age that you were, eight,
 nine years old wh en you 
had to leave 
Vienna
, did that bring back memo ries
 of your ch ildhood and leaving? 
A: No, but I remember telling 
Joanie
, my  oldest daughter, when she was eight that 
when  I was that age, you know, that -- wh
at -- but it didn™t make a big impression 
on her. I mean, she just knew -- it was just 
something that happened, you know, it -- 
it didn™t -- it didn™t affect me, it didn™t affect her, it was just a fact.  
Q: How did you present your family hist
ory an-and -- and what happened to th e 
Jews in 
Europe
 to your children? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
41
A: Well, they knew that their 
father and I had been  born in 
Euro pe
. I mean they stu 
-- they studied. We were very active at Temple 
Beth-El 
in 
Great Neck
 and they -- 
they studied what happened
. An d you know, they™d  ask us questions an-and -- and 
we™d answer it. And -- oh, I don™t know wh
at year it was, but wh en  I was teaching 
in 
Great Neck 
at the 
John F. Kennedy 
school, there had been  the program on the 
Holo caust on television. And my  principal 
and I were talking ab out it and she asked 
me if I wanted to, you know, gi
ve a talk to the fifth grader
s. At that time fifth grade 
was the highest grade in our school, and I di
d. And I told them my  story, and kids, 
you know, would ask me ques
tions about it and so on. 
Q: So you were very open
 with them and I know you
 said your husband lost 
relatives. Were you -- was he -- or -- we
re y-you or he open with  your ch ildren 
about that? 
A: Oh yes. Oh yes, because
 it was very traumatic. I mean
, he lost his grandparents 
and three uncles and one of the uncles
 was married and they had a little girl, 
Vera
, 
and my  first daughter™s middle name is 
Vera
. And th-they always -- they always 
knew the story and 
Frank 
told me how hard it was for his parents because they 
would send money to various consulates al
l over the wo rld and th ey would take the 
money and never give them
 visas. And his gran dpar
ents were on th e way to

42
Shanghai
 when 
Italy
 joined 
Germany
 in the war and so thei
r ship was turned back 
and they were all sent 
to the camps and killed. 
Q: Mm-hm. So your children, at a young 
age -- relatively young age were aware of 
this. 
A: Right. It™s like -- you know, y-you -- I-I 
don™t know so me -- we -- we™re a very 
open kind of fami ly and you 
know, it -- it was always part 
of their past. I mean, they 
-- they always knew about it. They -- yo
u know. I mean, both my  husband an d my  
parents and my in-laws had accents, so I 
think this sort of, you know, brou -- 
brought about questions. And 
my son, unfortunately, when he was in med school, 
got leukemia and my  s -- husband was the bone marrow donor, twice. And th e big 
joke always was, was 
Jerry
 going to get an accent, or 
my curly hair. He didn™t get 
the accent. He got my car -- curly hair the fi
rst time, he didn™t get it the second time. 
Q: Do you feel Viennese, Au
strian in any sense now? A
nd what are your thoughts 
about 
Vienna
 today? 
A: I don™t feel a -- I know that I™m prob
ably a little different, because people have 
said to me -- it -- it™s n o t so
 much that I -- I feel differe
nt, but w-we™ve traveled a lot 
and when  I go to  
Europe
, I really feel that people in 
Euro pe
 look more like me 
than people here. I don™t know why that is, 
but it -- it is. I -- I -- I have that feelin g. 
And -- but otherwise -- once in awhile I™ll j
oke around with -- with old friends of 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
43
mine and they™ll use a -- a word that I™m
 not familiar with an
d I™ll say, hey, you 
know, English is my se cond language 
and they -- everybody laughs, you know, 
cause I™ve been here 
for such a long time. 
Q: Have you been  back  to 
Vien na
? 
A: Yes, we went back  eight years ago 
because my  husband wanted  to see where I 
lived and so on. And he got food poisoning a
nd I really didn™t want to go in the first 
place. 
Q: Why not? 
A: Because I live in the presen
t and the future and to me 
the past is the past, it™s -- 
it™s gone. It™s -- that™s the way it is. I me
an, I -- I know people who live here in 
Mary land
 who dwell on their past. They™re some
times -- they are older than I am 
and maybe they had some horrible experien
ces, because I have a -- a step-cousin 
who was in the camps and she and I 
are pretty close, she lives in 
New York.
 And 
we™ve talked about it, that some people wh
o had very bad experi
ences, as she did, 
that she was in the camps, e
ither talk about it all the ti
me, or never talk about it. 
And she™s one of those people that never 
talks about it. So, people are different. I 
mean, you can™t say that all Viennese ki
ds who at the age of eight came to 
America
, you know, think one way or -- or -- 
or another. But I -- I mean, I could 
pass for 
Yankee Doodle Dandy
 any time. I am pr
oud to be here. I am thrilled every

time we co me back to the 
United States
, you know, from -- from a trip. Cause I am 
thoroughly American, 
except for those eight years when
 -- when I -- when I lived in 
Euro pe
. But the interesting thing is, since 
my husband and I were recently in 
Poland
 and the kids saw wh ere he was born and where he grew up, my  daughter 
Nancy
 suggested, and we took her up on it,
 and tw o of our granddau ghters are 
going to be 
Bat Mitzvahed
 this year, we™re going to take
 them and their older sister 
to 
Vienna
 and show them where I grew up. Th
is was not my idea, this was my 
daughter™s idea, but wa -- I™m going to  do 
it, I want to show th em, you know, th -- 
where I went to school, and the Temp le a
nd -- and so on. We™re going to take them 
to 
Vienna 
and to 
Prague
 to see, you know, the Jewish
 district that they have 
studied about. And -- but I have no
 -- no real, you know, connection to 
Vienna
 
except that I was born there. 
Q: When  you went back to 
Vienna
 -- wh at was it, seven, eight years ago you said -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- did you go back to your home and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and if so, what were your responses? 
A: Well, we -- we -- w e saw where I lived 
and the only th ing that had changed was 
the front door. And as I said there, my 
husband got terrible, terrible food poisoning 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
45
and I couldn™t wait to get out of there.
 He was really sick. And I -- I think 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Y-You couldn™t -- y
ou couldn™t wait to get out of 
there because he was sick or 
because it was 
Vienna 
and you -- and your 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: It was a combination -- it 
was a combination, I think. 
And I remember feelin g at 
a time when -- I don™t know how many year
s I was here or how many years I had 
spoken English, that I really
 didn't want to speak German
 and I didn 't  want to read 
any German books because I was -- inside my
self I was afraid that I would forget 
my  English. It was -- I -- I don™t rememb er
 how old I was, but I reme mb er that 
feeling. And I -- and I didn™t want to do that.  
Q: So English was comforting to  you? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. It -- I m
ean it -- this -- I-I -- you know, I™m 74 years old. This 
h a pp en ed  a lo ng
 time ago.  
Q: Are there any sights t
oday or sounds today that 
trigger your childhood in 
Vienna
? 
A: Yes. My father was a very good dancer, 
and he loved to waltz and he t-taught me 
how to waltz at a very young ag e. I ta
ught my husband how to  waltz, and very  
often, you know, when  we hear a waltz, 
you know, I get all mu shy about my  dad. I 
was very close to my father. But other than that, no. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
46
Q: N-No  other sights or -- 
A: No, no. 

Q: -- smells or anything? 
A: Well, as I said, my mother was a very
 good cook and even 
though she went to 
junior college, she also went to cooking school in 
Vienna
. And she -- you know, an 
-- name it. 
Za cher torte,
 the 
Linzer torte
, the -- whatever, you know she could 
make it. But I never learned how to bake an
y of those things because my  family was 

very equally divided. My father ha -- you 
know, had the business. I was the scholar 
and my  mother took care of the house. And 
-- so my  kids are be
tter cooks than I am 
because I never went into cooking.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Marianne Liebermann.
 This is tape number 
two, side 
A.
 And let™s talk now a little bit about 
your teaching experience, when you 
started and what you taught and so forth. 
A: Well, I taught in 
Great Neck, New York 
for 27 years. I was at first a part-time 
teacher and I taught in several school
s, and eventu ally taught at the 
John F. 
Kennedy 
school. It was an elementary school, 
and I taught middle and high school 
ESL
 in the summer. 

Q: Which is English to speakers of other languages. 
A: Oh, yes. Well, actually in 
New York
 it™s called teachers of English as -- to 
speakers of other languages, so it™s called 
TESL
 rather than 
ESOL
 as it is called 
here. 
Q: And you obviously had 
children from other countrie
s who came here and you 
having th at experience yourself
 as a young child, did you 
feel a connection to them? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And could you u
nderstand wh at they were going th rough? 
A: Well, I did, except their problems are 
very different. A lot of my students were 
from 
Iran
, who came after the 
Shah
, and they had -- they were totally different 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
48
socio-economic background 
than the refugee childre
n who came in 1938 from 
Germany
 and 
Austria
. And their problems were -- were different. It was not only 
the language, but a lot of their mothers ha
d really not been their caretakers. There 
were a lot of servants who really brought
 up these children. An
d when the mothers 
were faced with bringing up 
the children, there were a lo t of problems. Some of the 
children didn™t change their clothes day af
ter day after day, they slept in their 

clothes. They had a lot of tr
ouble getting used to the food 
here that -- that -- it was 
very different. Like school 
lunches, you know, were a big problem for them. But all 
in all, children are children and the younger you are wh en  you learn a second 

language, the easier it is. A
nd my  job was to take the 
children from their classro o m 
in small groups and teach them, rather than
 have a whole class of children. And as I 
said, I had children from 
Iran
, from
 Japan, 
fro m
 South American, 
from
 Central 
America, 
fro m
 Europe. 
My first two 
ESL 
students when  I started teaching, were 
the sons of the 
CEO 
of 
Lufthansa
. And I had to swallow just a couple of times, but 
they were tw o of my  best students a
nd they did very well in their lives. 
Q: Did you speak in Ge
rman to them and -- 
A: No, we were not really -- oh, I wouldn™t
 say -- allowed is -- is too strong a word, 
but we were encouraged not to speak an
yone™s native language because our groups 
were mixed, and so it wouldn™t be fair that
, you know, if I speak 
Spanish, I spoke to 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
49
the Hispanic kids, and you kn
ow, the Iranian, I don™t speak
 Iranian or Japanese. So 
the goal of an 
ESL 
teacher is to have the children th ink in English. And that™s what 
we tried to do. 
Q: So you said you did not tell them a
bout your background and having to -- to 
learn a new language yourself at a young ag e? 
A: Sometimes I did, as I got more into th
e program and as I had the older children. 
You know, the fifth graders were the olde
st ones, but the young ones, I certainly 
didn™t tell them, too. And it was very help
ful when computers ca
me into the schools 
because some children really had difficulty
 learning. They ha
d difficulty learning 
anything. And so me children came from 
countries where there was very little 
education for them, and we had to teach 
them, you know, how to tell time and tie 
their shoes and -- and -- you know, very -- very basic things. 

Q: Di-Did you feel any kind 
of connection to these children, having to have left 
their country of birth and co ming to the 
United States
? Kind of a deep seated 
connection, in that sense. 

A: I did, but we had a very, shall we sa
y strict supervisor 
who advised us in no 
uncertain terms that our job was not to be so
cial workers, but to teach them English. 
And so ex -- we had a lot of after school
 things. We had parties for th e children and 
their parents and we had different kinds 
of foods, and -- and yo
u know, we™d  have 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
50
like an Iranian lunch, where their parents 
could participate, or a Japanese sushi 
lunch, or you know, things like that. But th
ere were social work
ers attached to the 
program, and th at was really  more their job than mine. 
Q: Let™s now talk a little bit about the religious aspect of your experience. Did 
having to leave because you were Jewish, 
when you were a young child, did that 
enter into your th oughts and were you angry 
that these things -- you were having to 
leave because you were Jewish? 
A: No, because 
in 1938 in 
Vien na
, if you were Jewish, if you were part of a Jewish 
family, you really felt that you were Au
strian before you were Jewish. And my 
parents were not particularly religious. 
And it wasn™t until many years later that I 
realized, if I hadn™t been Jewish, would my
 life be very different? Would I have not 
left, a-and so on and so forth. 
Q: So as you matured and you raised ch
ildren, did you become mo re religiously 
affiliated than you were as a child ? 
A: Yes, I did. I did. My  husband and I jo
ined Temple shortly after we were married, 
and I was vice-president of my  sisterhood and very active in the Temple and saw to 
it that the kids went to religious school, and -- 
Q: So why is it that you did 
that, as opposed to  your feelings as a young child? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
51
A: I think being an only child
, you need affiliation and so 
that was very important to 
me and always has been, and 
probably always will be.  
Q: What about -- your though ts about the -- when the 
Eichmann
 trial came up, and 
-- in 
Israel
? Did you have any sp ecial feelin
gs about that because of your 
background? 
A: Well, I mean, I was -- I was as horrified 
as anyone else, and hoped that they , you 
know, 
A
, would be ab le to find him, and then 
would be able to pro-pros -- prosecute 
him. But I™m not really a hateful person 
and I -- I mean, I didn™
t personally really, 
you know, connect, I mean -- a-as everyone
 I knew, you know, was happy that they 

found him and that they  prosecuted him and 
that they were able to do it and th-they 
had the trial. But other than that, I don™t 
reme mb er having any other thoughts about 
it. 

Q: Mm-hm. During the Civil Rights struggl
es -- struggle in the 60™s and 70™s and so 

forth, and knowing what you did ab out 
Hitler™s
 taking aw ay the civil rights of 
countries, again, was there any special me
aning to you about th
at struggle here? 
A: Well, I was getting my Master™s at 
Adelphi 
University at th -- and I was driving 
home when 
Martin Luther King
 was killed, and I -- I was just horrified and 
shocked, because I have black friends an
d I -- you know, I -- I-I was speechless, I 
was horrified. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
52
Q: More so because of 
your childhood experience? 
A: No, it had nothing to do with it. I -- 
I just felt, how could this happen in 
America? 
I mean, lan d  of the free, etcetera 
and so fo rth. You know, when  you 
grow up in 
New York,
 yes there™s prejudice, there™s always prejudice of -- of -- of -
- of all kinds, but I don™t think I fully re
alized how much hatred there was between 
blacks and whites until 
that happened to 
Martin Luther King.
 I didn™t really know 
about segregated schools, I didn™t know 
ab out segregated bathrooms and drinking 
fountains and things like that. I had read 
about it, but I never, you know, was really 
aware of it.  

Q: Did you ever connect in your mind th
e si-similarity between those kind of 
restrictions and the Nazi restrictio ns? 

A: No, never, never. Maybe I was dumb, but I 
didn™t. I didn™t. I me
an, that was then 
and this is now. 

Q: So politically today, you feel the way 
you did whether or not
 you were born in 
Euro pe
 or not. 
A: I™m not sure what you mean? 

Q: Your political view s today a-are n -- are they influenced -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- by what your family experien ced
 and your relatives experienced? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann

A: No, not at all, not at all. I -- I don™
t think so . I don™t think my  parents were 
particularly political as -- as such. 
Q: Were they Zionists? 
A: No, no, uh-huh, no. 
Q: Did they talk about 
Palestine
 when you were very young? 
A: No.  

Q: And when the State of
 Israel
 was formed, was that a -- 
A: Oh, they were very -- th
ey were very happy, a-as was I, of course, and anyone 
who™s read 
Exodus, 
seen 
Ex odus
, how could you not -- 
how could you not be? 
And, you know, as you said, a-as I got ol
der and matured, I -- I realized all the 
horro r that had gone on and how lu cky I 
was. And there was a long time, when I 
took a shower, I thought about the people in
 the camp s, I did. That was a long time, 
and even now, once in
 awhile, I think about that. And 
I™ve always tried to do a lot 
of volunteer work and th 
-- in connection with helpin
g people, even when  I was 
working and certainly now, because I feel
 that somewhere or somehow, there is a 
reason that my  family and I were spared. 
Because we could have just as well, you 
know, gone to the camps and been killed.  
Q: Do you have any sense of
 guilt that your family did get out, thank -- fortunately. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
54
A: No, I have no -- I -- I-I have no se
nse of guilt. I wonder why it happened. I™ll 
never know why -- I mean, I -- my  dad had 
the courage and th e guts, but sometimes 
I -- I think about it, you know, like why? And there™s no answer. 
Q: Again, what was it about him and his co
urage and his guts to make that decision 
and oth -- that others did not? 
A: Well, as I -- as I told you, my dad said
, had -- had he been 
older or richer. Not 
that we were poor, but I guess, you know, 
I don™t know what he meant by th at. H-he 
wouldn™t have just pulled up stakes, or ma
ybe, you know, if he had a bigger family, 
many mo re children, or -- you know, it would have been  hard er. Or -- I -- I guess a 

lot of it was luck, that he thought of the 
Simons
, you know, to -- to give him the 
affidavit and that they, as non-Jews did it.
 Because, let™s face it, who -- who -- it™s 

not so easy to be responsible for three pe
ople. I mean, they never had to help  us 
monetarily, but still. I remember w e were 
at their house when th
e war broke out in 
Euro pe. 
That was a very horrible weekend. But -- 
Q: Can -- can you describe that weekend? 
A: Well, they -- they
 lived outside of 
Philadelphia
 in  a beautiful gray stone 
mansion. And I guess their kids were teenag
ers at that time, I know they were about 
10 years older than I am, and -- well, ev
erybody was really crying. I mean, you 
know, everybody was just so sad, and sa 
-- an-and so upset. And my  mo ther and my

dad, too, but mo re my  mo the
r, remained friends with the 
Simons 
all the years until 
they died, the 
Simons
 died. And as I said, she was ab
le to bring over a lot of her 
possessions, you know, crystals and figuri
nes and so on, and I think -- you know, 
like for Christma s she woul
d send them some thing like that, or she would bake 
them a cake, or you know, I mean they -- th ey really kept in touch. And this Mrs. 

Simon, Helen Simon
 was such a wonderful pers
on th at when  my  daughter 
Joan
 
was born, she sent her a silver spoon fo r 
her birthday an d for Christmas every year 
until she had a dozen. And each
 spoon is engraved with 
her na -- with her initials, 
J.V.L.
 and the date. And it™s become
 a tradition, because when  
Alyssa
 was 
Bat 
Mitzvahed
, she did the sh -- Jo -- you know, 
Joanie 
is gung-ho, she bought the 
whole set at once for 
Alyssa
. So  that™s the story th at
™s gone on in  our family. 
Q: Did th e 
Simons
 sponsor other people, did they 
write out affidavits for others? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t kn
ow that. But I know when 
Joanie
 went to the University 
of 
Wisconsin
, 
Helen Simon
 was very upset. She felt that
 there were a lot of radical 
people out there and she wouldn™t be 
happy, and so  on and so forth. And 
Joanie
 
went to 
Wisconsin
 and unfortunately was there when
 they had all the trouble with 
the bombings, but she got a good 
education. That™s how it was. 
Q: Do you think that the wo rld has l
earned any lessons from the Holocaust?  

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
56
A: I hope so. I just hope so, and certainl
y the mu seum here and all the mu seums that 
talk about the Holocaust all 
over th-this country,
 you know, are doing th eir best to 
let people never forget, and that it did ha
ppen. And my  husband was at the opening 
of the Ho locaust Museum and he described 
to me how there were people there with 
signs that said that the Holocaust never 
happened. That™s a little hard for me to 
believe, but I know that ther
e are groups like that in the 
United States
. I don™t know 
why they feel that way, but that™s how it is. 
Q: Is there anything you wanted  to add to
 your thoughts about your experience, or 
your childhood? Do -- d-do you
 plan to go back? I know 
you said you were going to 
take your ch ildren back -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- to 
Vienna. 
And can you maybe talk a little bit 
about the previous trip that you 
just took this fall, this 
past fall with your family? 
A: Well, we went back to my husb an
d™s hometown , which 
originally was in 
Germany
, but after the second Wo rld War was given to 
Poland
, and the name, in 
German it™s 
Gleiwitz 
and it was changed to  
Gliwice
 in 
Poland
, and it was under the 
Russian influence. And thro ugh the Holocaust Museum, th
is forum found
 out about 
the fact that 
Frank 
was born in this town and cont
acted us, and they erected a 
memorial to the Jews that 
had lived  in this town. And it was a very, very moving

experience for us. We also went to 
Berlin
 and I really wanted to
 be very unhappy in  
Berlin
 and I really wasn™t, because I could u
nderstand everything, and we stayed at 
the 
Hilton
, which is like staying in 
America 
i-in -- in a -- another country . And two 
of my  children had been  to 
Germany
 20 years ago wh en the wall was up, and they 
could not believe the change in 
Ea st
 
Germany
. It -- it was just mind boggling to 
them. And 
Berlin
 is such a modern  city and so many new buildings and a lot of 
hustle and bustle. And in 
Frank™s 
hometown also, there™d been  a big change over 
the eight years. As I said, it had been u
nder Ru ssian influence, and now it seems to 
be, you know, a -- a -- a great place to live no
w. The people that live there were all 
forced to leave wher
e they lived in the 
Ukraine
 and settle in this town. And they™ve 
made the best of it, and unfortunately th
ere™s a lot of pollution there. There had 
been a coal mine there, which it was clos
ed, but there™d also been industry and all 
the waste had been dumped into th e river. A
nd so  there is a great deal of pollution, 
and also they still use coal to heat their 
homes. So at night there™s like a smog, it 
makes your eyes itch. And my  son, being a 
doctor, wanted to fi
nd out the statistics 
about lung cancer there, but we -- you know, we
 -- we weren™t able to -- to find that 
out. And also, 
Frank
 wanted to s-show our childre
n the apartment where we lived 
because the house is still st
anding. They changed the na
me of the street and the 
house numb er, but the pe
ople at the forum, 
Andre,
 said that the people were afraid

to show 
Frank 
the apartment because a lot of th
e Germans who had lived there are 
now trying to reclaim those apartments. An
d so the people somehow connected  that 
with us. So we couldn™t see the ap artmen
t, but we saw the outside of the build ing 
and 
Frank
 showed us where he learned how to 
ride his bicycle and where he went 
to school, and so  on. And th e memorial that
 they erected was a beautiful -- they had 
commissioned a Po lish sculptor to ma
ke this memorial. It™s a broken 
To rah
 wi -- 
and with an eternal flame in it, an d they
 weren't able -- the synagogue had been  
destroyed on 
Kristallnacht
 and so the land wh ere the synagogue was was 
transferred to a Jewish group, but the gr
oup is about a hund
red miles away from 
there, and they™re in dire straights and th ey were in the process of selling the land. 
So they had to get the 
permission from the building next door and that™s a 
cooperative building and th ey did get the pe
rmission of all the people who lived in 
that build ing and so the me mo ri
al is attached to that -- th
e wall of that building. And 
my son-in-law -- one of my son-in-law
s passed by there after they had the 
ceremony, and there was a mother and 
a little girl. And I don™t know whether 
they™re speaking German or -- somehow he understood what they  said. And I don™t 
know what the mother said
 to the little girl, but the little girl said, what™s a 
synagogue? Which so rt of ga
ve us the chills, you know? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
59
A: And we just hope that nobody will de
stroy this memorial, or you know, put 
graffiti on it or -- or so on. But it was a very moving trip. 
Q: Do you or 
Frank
 have any desire to go back to 
Gleiwitz
 again? 
A: I don™t think so. I don™t think so . We
 -- my  husband has a distant cousin, a 
painter named 
Max Liebermann. 
And they ha -- are in the 
-- that -- that painter™s 
summer house is just outside of 
Berlin
, in 
Wannsee.
 And they™re in the process of 
transferring his pictures, which are now in one of the mu seums in 
Berlin
 to this 
building, and they™re in the midst of fu
ndraising because it™s very expensive to 
make a building safe and 
climately
 controlled for, you know, 
works -- works of art. 
And possibly some of my kids -- they™re 
supposed to open it in 2005, s -- possibly 
some of my  kids might go back to there. 
But there™s no reason, you know, for us to 
go back to  
Gleiwitz.
 
Q: When  did your parents pass away? 

A: My mo th er died in 1990 and my  dad died  in 1979. 
Q: And your mother was able to
 manage once your father died? 
A: Yes, yes. I mean, she didn™t have to 
worry about money and things like that, and 
my  husband helped  her with, you know, 
writing ch ecks and th ings like that. And 
eventually she became too ill 
to manage on her own and 
she was in a nursing home 
right near my  house in 
Great Neck
 for three and a half years before she died.

Q: You have two childre
n who are physicians -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- and one who is a lawyer? 
A: Right, right. 
Q: Uh-huh, and -- and d-do they  talk to 
you about your childhood
 frequently, or -- 
A: Well more so now than before, but it -- 
it™s not a big deal in our family, because 
it™s something they gr
ew up with. I mean, we never 
made a big deal about it. Our 
kids are all married to Jewi
sh spouses, spices, however you say th at. And people in 
today™s world say to us, you know, how di
d you do th at, and so
 on. And I don™t 
think we ever overdid it with that, and we
 never overdid it with our backgrounds. 
It™s just part of who we are. 

Q: When  you hear the German language, 
does that trigger anything for you? 
A: Yes, I --  and I understand it, even th
ough my German is pr
obably like an eight 
year old. I don™t -- you know, I haven™
t -- I -- I did take some courses at 
NYU
 in his 
-- in German history, but I™m
 sure I don™t speak like an
 adult German. But when I 
hear it on the radio or on th e 
TV, 
I like it, because I underst
and it. And it is -- th-
that was one of the reasons why -- I -- you know, in 
Berlin 
I turned on the 
TV
, it 
was all in German, fine with me, you kno
w? The kids were very -- my children 

were very impressed, you 
know. And I had been to 
Frankfurt 
with 
Frank
 on

business at the 
Frankfurter messe
 when he was in the 
textile business. And I 
remember at the hotel, some
body said to me, oh your Ge
rman is so good. And I 
said, crossing my  fingers, oh you know, 
our American schools are excellent, 
because I really didn™t wa
nt to go into the fact, you 
know, that I was born in  
Vienna.
 I mean, it wasn™t anybody™s business. 
Q: Why -- why didn™t you want
 to say you were born in  
Vienna
? 
A: I don™t know. It was just one of thos
e things, you know. I just -- who knows? It 
was oh, at least 20 - 25 years ago. 
Q: Were you afraid someth
ing was going to happen? 
A: No, no, no. I mean, ever
yone I know knows that 
Frank 
and I were born in  
Euro pe
, and as I said, you know, I -- we joke
 about it sometimes. B u t I don™t know, 
it was one of those things, you know? 
You wake up in the mo rning, you do 
something silly, and that was the -- what I did. 

Q: Mm-hm. Any message you want 
to give your grandchildren? 
A: Be good to each other, love each 
other and be happy
 and healthy. 
Q: Anything else you wanted to  add to  the tape? 

A: I don™t think so. I don™t think so . This was a great experience. 
Q: Before we close, do you co
nsider yourself a survivor? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
62
A: No, I really don™t, because I feel guilty
 using that term, because I know that so 
many people who eventually es
caped the Nazis went through
 so much in the camps, 
and being hidden and so forth, an d th
ank God I didn™t have any of those 
experiences.  
Q: Even though your family and your -- 
your life w-was in danger and that™s why 

your father deci -- and mother decided to leave? 

A: Even so. A-As a young child, as a -- 
a very protected young child, I -- at that 
time, of co urse, I didn™t realize the dang
er. And since my  life continued, just in 
another language, in another school, in anothe
r place, I-I don™t feel that I was that 

affected. 
Q: Do you feel in any way 
jealous of those Jews who were bor -- your ag e, who 
were born in this country and did not have
 to go th rough what you did, and your 
parents -- and also that -- what
 your parents went thro ugh? 
A: No, I™m not a jealous person, and you 
know, it™s wherever the stork drops you, 
it™s -- that™s how it is. 
Q: Have you been  to the Holocaust Museum? 

A: Yes, I have. I was there twice. Once wi
th  my  husband and once with my  cousin 
who lives in 
New York. 
Q: And your reaction? 

 
Interview with Marianne Liebermann 
January 9, 2004 

 

 
 
63
A: I didn™t read everything and I didn™t 
stop at every single exhibit. It was really 
hard for me to go, and I had a lot of night
mares about it after I -- I ca -- I dreamt 
about it a lot. And I never watch any Nazi 
movies or anything like that before I go 
to sleep because I know 
I would dream about it.  
Q: Because of what 
you went through? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know, maybe just the -- the plain horro r of it. I don™t think 
necessarily about what I went
 through. It™s just the fa
ct that it happened. Man™s 
inhumanity to man. My husband and I have
 always talked about, it was bad enough 
that people couldn™t help themselves, or so
 they said, but that  intellectual people, 
like professors and doctors we
re involved in  the annihila
tion of so many people. We 
just can™t understand that, we -- we really 
can™t, and I don™t th
ink to my  dying day 
I™ll ever understand that. 

Q: Is it to your benef -- or was it to your 
benefit that you were so young at the time 
when  your parents decided to leave and 
-- and if you had been  older and mo re 
aware of the dangers, it would have affected you mo re? 

A: Probably. I mean, I-I -- I™l
l never know, but probably . 
As I said, you know, as I 
told you, and I told my gr
anddaughter, it was a different time. Your parents said, 
we™re going to 
America
, so we went to 
America
. That was as simple as that.
