(Applause)
 
  
Henry Kahn:  
I'll sit over there.
 
Bill Benson: Sit over here.  All right.  Henry, thank you som uchf orbeing with us today 
andbeing willing to be our f irst person. Andwe have so m uchfor you to share with us inan 

hour, so we're going to start right away, if  that's okay with you. 
 
Henry, you were ten years old when Hitler and the Nazis cam e topower in 1933.  Before 
we turn to those years and the war and the Holocaust, tell usf irst what you canabout your 

fam ily and yourself before the Nazis took control in 1933. 
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, we lived
 
--
 
we li ved in a sm all town not farf romStuttgartand m y 
parents were ver y f riendly with af am ily over t here. And the husband of  thef am ily, his nam e 

wa s  Mr.
 
Kinsler.  He was the owner of a toy factory.  Excuse me.  My brother who was two 
years younger than I was and I
 
--
 
we had a lot of fun with all the presents we gotf rom  the toy 
factory because that was very goodf or us and wonderf ul. My parents were very f riendly wi th 

the fam ily.  T hey went
 
--
 
they went skiing with  them  andon
 
--
 
they went
 
--
 
they went skiing and 
played tennis and they were
 
--
 
on Sunday m ornings m y f atherand Mr.
 
Kinsler, they used to get 
together in a restaurant.  And inf act, m yf ather once suggested to Mr.
 
Kinsler thathe should 
join the party, the Nazi party, becausehe said in ord
er to stay
 
--
 
you have todo that.  However, 
they also went to am asked ball on Halloween.  Had two daughtersandm y
 
--
 
m y brother and I 
are about the sam eage and we played together. W ehad a real
 
--
 
they were cooking and 
baking doing all sorts ofthings.  It was ver y nice.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, yo u wrote in your m em oir, you've written am emoir and you wrote it 
in, " during those yearsm y parents lived a norm al,healthy lif e."
 
Henry Kahn: Absolutely.  Just like we do here, too, in the United States. T here
 
was no 
difference at all. W hether they were Je wish or Christian or whatever.  It was all the sam e. And 

you were ver y f riendly. W e were observing Jewish but otherwise we were just about the sam e.
 
Bill Benson: As Im entioned earlier, yourf atherf ought for Germ any in thef irst world war.  
W hat do you know about hisexperience?
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, hewas 19 years old.  Hewas draf ted. And hism other listenedto the 
draf t board hoping that he wouldn't be sent awa y toof ar. So sheput in a wordf orhim bec
ause 
he was the only one on thefam ily who was lef t becauseher
 
--
 
m y father's father had already 
passed away and shewas a wido w.  So to show the
 
--
 
the sym pathy of  the off icer, he didn't 
send her
 
--
 
he didn't sendm y f ather just to next door tothe
 
--
 
to
 
thecavalr y which was a little 
while a way.  He told her that he has tobe joining the Navy and theNavy had to serve forfour 

years rather than three or two.  And that was the kindnessof the
 
--
 
of theGerman.  So m y 
father was in the Navy for
 
--
 
altogeth
er he was in the Navy and theArm y f or seven years. The 
war was f our years and he had another three years of service until the endof  the
 
--
 
the war 
ended andhe got the Iron Cross which is a very good
 
--
 
ver y good recognition.  And fortunately 
he got that because he was under the im pression thatnothing could happen to him.  As it 

turned out in the end it didn't help at all.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, in 1930 yourf am ily m oved toStuttgart and youattended theW aldorf  
School. W hat was theWaldorf School?
 
Henry
 
Kahn: TheW aldorf  School wasf ounded by the owner of afactory who wanted his 
em ployees, the children of the em ployees togo to a school which was modern and whichwas 

up to date.  And he engaged a philosopherf rom Austriaby the name of Steiner who
 
--
 w
h ose 

4 
 
idea it was thatboys and girls shouldbe in the sam e class together.  And in thef irst gradethe 
boys learned how to knit and to sew and crochetand the girls
 
--
 
the girls of  course learned that 
too.T hen in thethirdgrade the girls learnedhow to do woodwork and they also were hadan 

opportunity to learn gardening, and theboys did too. As you see itwas a very progressi ve  

school. And as it turned out the progressive schooldidn'texactly ji ve  with the Nazi philosophy 

where ever ything was controlled and consequently eventually 1938the schoolhad to
 
--
 
wa s  
closedandthe teachers were out of a job had to lookf ora job
 
--
 
had tof ind a job.  My teacher's 
name was Hagar, KarlHagar.  The reason Im entionthat is because he will come up lateron.
 
Bi
ll Benson: W e'llm ake sure that com esup later on.
 
Henry Kahn: You bet.
 
Bill Benson:  Yourfam ily, Henr y, suffered aterrible tragedy in 1932when your brother 
died.
 
George Pick:  Yes, in 1932 m y brother passed away.  He passedaway of a kind of
 
--
 
of  
mi
ddle ear infection and sohe couldn't
 
--
 
hedied.  He didn't have any penicillin yet.  Penicillin 
was developed in1927.  However, it didn't get to thehospital wherem y f ather was sothat's 

what happened.T hatwas thef irst calam ity which m y parents had.
  
And of course me too, but 
particularly m y parents becausethey were ve ry unlucky later on also. 
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, in 1933, of course Hitler
 
--
 
Henry Kahn: 1933 the Hitler
 
--
 
Hitler cam e to power.  And m yf ather at thattim e, we 
lived in Stuttgart at
 
that tim e.  Andm y father was the president, as you heard bef ore, of a cattle 
dealers' association.  And shortly af ter Hitlercam e topower, Nazis i n the unif orm walked in to 

his off ice and told him  " You're out." T hat's all there was to it.  My father threw the keys tonf loor 

and walkedout. T here was nothing he coulddo about itbecause they were the power and 

that's what's it.  So then eventually m y f atherwent to Israelat this tim e
 
--
 
at that tim ePalestine, 
and whenhe cam eback tofind outhow li ving was at that tim e.  And when he cam eback, he 

s a id
 
--
 
excuse me. If we li ve here the way we have to live in Palestine, we last a long tim e.  
Very unf ortunately he was dead wrong. 
 
Bill Benson: Sohe thought things would stillbe better
 
--
 
he thought th
ings would be 
better staying in Germany.
 
Henry Kahn: That was the indication.W hat's m ore, hef iguredhehad the Iron Cross 
andthat would save him  or guard him.
 
Bill Benson:  How did your father's
 
--
 
how didyour f ather support the fam ily af terhe lost 
his job? 
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, af ter that, hef irst
 
--
 
h e f i r s t
 
--
 
hef irst got some clothing and he took 
over not a clothing com pany buta retailer and that didn't last too long.  And he had a partner 

who was e xperienced in that andhedouble crossedhim .  T hen he decided
 
--
 
hen they had an 
opportunity to pick
 
--
 
to
 
--
 
he had an opportunity to
 
--
 
to take over a plywood dealership in 
Cologne.  So we m oved to Cologne. And another thing, in '38, all Jewish children hadto leave 

the schools in Germ any.  And there was a Jewish school in Cologne and I was able to gothere.  

And that was good.  Itworked out well for me. T hat was where we were at the time of 

Kristallnacht.
 
Bill Benson: Before we talkabout Kristallnacht, Henry, af ter Hitler cam e topower, your 
mo
ther really wanted to em igrate, didn't she?
 
Henry Kahn: Oh, m y m other, rightf rom  thebeginning, she said let's get out of Germany.  
Butm y father was persistentand atthat timewe were they weren't as powerf ulas they wer e 

today and the wom anagreed with thehusband and consequently, although m y m other insisted 

5 
 
she tookall sorts of courses tobepreparedto get to another country.  Preferably the United 
States.  She learned how to sew ties and shirts and make candies Im ean, she was very well 

prepared t
o com e over here but m y f ather wouldn't budge.
 
Bill Benson: Butas you said, he was a decorated soldier.
 
Henry Kahn: He thought a decorated soldier would be okay.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, yo u learned to blow glass  and makeneon tubesas a youngster.
 
Henry Kahn: I was wh at?
 
Bill Benson:  You learned to blow glass andto
 
--
 
Henry Kahn: That was something I learned while I was
 
--
 
while we were in Cologne.  
T he superintendentof  the building he knew how to blow glass and Ilearned that. And it cam e 

in ver y handy later on.
 
Bill Benson: W hich we will hear about, Ihope. W hich we wil l hear about I hope, later, 
you learned that skill.  Kristallnacht, the Night of  BrokenGlass, tell us what that was and what it 

m eant for your f am ily.
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, I didn't know what was go ing on but a friend of mine who workedf or 
a baker, he cam eby around 7:00or 6:30 in the morning and toldm e, " Don't go to school"  

because there were all sorts of things going on which are not good. And I stayedhom ethat 

day.  There was aThursday and then Friday m orning andm y father was hopethef ollowing 

day, which was Saturday m orning.  And two big f ellows cam e tothehouse and said is your 

fa the r
 
--
 
I opened thedoor and they said "Is yourf atherhere?"  so my f ather cam eout.  And 
they
 
said," Com e with m e."   That'sall.  So there were two police off icers not in unif orm. T hey 
were ci vil.  And they took m yf ather to the police station. However, ton way there,m y f ather 

said what would you have done if  Ihadn'tbeen home?T hey saidwell, I would have gone to 

your neighbor because he's also Jewish andwe
 
--
 
all I have to do is f ill our quota.  So thatwas 
theexcusef or going.  So you can imagine. 
 
Bill Benson: W hat happened to yourf ather after they took him  away?
 

Henry Kahn:W ell, hewas awa y f or aboutf our weeks.  And when he cam eback,he was 
in terrible shape.  And he said if  I go
 
--
 
if  I getin there again
 
--
 
he was taken to Dachau which 
you probably are fam iliar with.  T hat's a concentration cam p near Munich. And when he cam e 

bac
k,he said if ever I get thereagain, I won't come out alive.  Andthat was very true.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, on the night of Kristallnacht, that Novem ber9
-
10, hundreds of  
synagogues were burned across Germ any but yours wasn't.
 
Henry Kahn: Pardon?
 
B ill B e n
son:  Your synagogue wasn't burned.
 
Henry Kahn: No, because it was attached
 
--
 
I m ean,the building wa s attached to other 
buildings and they didn't
 
--
 
they didn'tput it on f ire because they wer e af raid thef ire wouldgo to 
thenext building.  However, it
 
was ransacked.  Terribly ransacked. And it was amess. W hat's 
m ore, m y school was in the sam e com pound.  It wasn't connected to the synagoguebut itwas 

in the sam e compound, a special building.  Itwas a Jewish school, as I mentioned bef ore, and 

th a t's
 
the way it worke d.  But we didn't do much learning anym ore after that.
 
Bill Benson: And infact, soon
 
--
 
soon after Kristallnacht, your parents m adethe 
prof ounddecision to send youaway.
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, I was very f ortunatem y cousin was
 
--
 
wa s  wo r k
i ng in London ornear 
London.  Andhehad a girlf riend. And the girl f riend'sfather was a part owner of a clothing 

factory.  And he persuaded the
 
--
 
that person, whose nam e was London, to guaranteem e, 
because I had to be guaranteedto getthe Kindertransport. Soone day we received a 

6 
 
telegram , sent dates of hire and his
 
--
 
hisaddress.  Imean, the
 
--
 
and m y parents said
 
--
 
s en t  
m y inform ation.  And I was lucky because it only went upto17. I was 16 years old when Igot 
that, that telegram . So on early February 1939 m y parents tookm e to the
 
--
 
to the railroad 
station and said good
-
bye through the window and they lef tat theplatf orm.  However, they 
ca m e 
--
 
they cam e to the street,theyf oundout that thetrain hadbeen delayed by two 
hours
 
--
 
by a half  an hour, sotheyf igured they'd spendaf ew m orem inutes with m e.  Andthe 
m om ent they came back, I knew I wasn't goi ng to see them again.Bef ore that I knew I would 

see them  again.  But ten m inutes later, I saw them  again and that was it and I never sa
w or  

heardf rom them again
 
--
 
well, I heard
 
--
 
I gotsom e lettersf rom  them eventually in England, but 
otherwise, I didn't see them anym ore, talk tothem anym ore. That was it.  It was quite a shock, I 

can assure you. But Ifelt it, thatthis is it.
 
W e ll ,
 
the train lef t eventually.  W e came to Holland andaf ter we hadcrossed theborder, 
ever ybody was ver y relieved and indicatedhow relie ved you are.  I'd like to tell you a little story 

there.T here was a girl, maybe ten years old,she hada newspaper,an
 
illustrated newspaper 
andthere was a picture of Hitleron it. T he mom ent she was sure we were in Hollandandnot in 

Germ any anym ore, she took the picture of Hitler and tore it into thousandsof pieces. T hatgoes 

to show you how the em otions were when we got across theborder.  And the next day we got 

to
 
--
 
we  go t to
 
--
 
onaferry through the same night we got to theferry and we got to England.  
And thenext day we were takenby busf rom Liverpool
 
--
 
no, not f rom  Liverpool but we cam e 
f r om
 
--
 
f rom  the p
ort.W e were taken by bused to Liverpool stationin London. There wasa big 
hall and everybody had be signs.  So
 
--
 
with their
 
--
 
notnam esbutnum bers on it. I knew a little 
English because we had learned a little bit in school, but the pronunciation was entirely 

different. And it wasn't quite that easy.  However, I saw a nice lady walking in andIf igured I'd 

try and help her.  So I walked up to herand said, " May I help you?" and shepulled out apiece 

of  paperand looked at it and saidhmmm , Heinz K
ahn.  I had found m y sponsor.
 
(Laughter)
 
Som y cousin cam e with the car and we drove to their home. T hef irst thing, well we had 
dinner.  I m et Mr.
 
London andthe daughter and Mrs.
 
Londonof  course I knewfrom the place.  
And thef irst thing we had som e dinner and we had peasand meat, I don't remember what. But 

the im portant thing is the reasonIm entionedit is because Mrs.
 
London was very concerned 
aboutm eeating properly.  The English wa y.  Now, you know, in theUnited States you 

eat
 
--
 
you cut your
 
--
 
you cut yourf ood, you put it inthe right hand and eat it in the United 
States.  In Europe you eat with your
 
--
 
you cut your f oodbut you use your lef thand to put it into 
your m outh. Asf araspeasare concerned, you just push them  on thefork.  In England, you 

have to takethef ork and spear it. So you get three orfour pieces of peas on it andput it in 

your m outh.  You don't get ver y m uch.
 
(Laughter)
 
But this is the way you have toeat in England.  Im ean supposedly. Supposedly. W ell, I 
had m y own room  and I
 
--
 
and then Mr.
 
London askedm e," Do you want to go to school?"I said 
I would pref erto work.  The reason I said thatis A, Ihad nomoney at all, and B, more 

im portantly, I wanted to learn something sowhen I get to the United States, which
 
I had in m y 
m indall the time,I'd have som ething to show that I would be able to m ake a living.
 
W ell, as it turnedout, Iwas in a glorif iedprison actually.  Mr.
 
London tookm e tohis work 
ever y m orning, brought me back every af ter
 
--
 
evening, andI had
 
lunch with the staff and that 
was it.  I was getting bored with that.  I mean, I learnedhow to make knotsand how to put tags 

on thepants, but this is no prof ession. SoI asked him , can I pleasework in the sewing
 
--
 
on 

7 
 
the sewing m achine. So of course that wasn't appropriatef or theprodigy of  the
 
--
 
of a factory 
owner to work with those com monpeople. Im ean, that was not right.  Couldn't do it
 
Bill Benson: Becausehe was the owner of  thef actory.
 
Henry Kahn: He was the owner, exactly.  The owner of  thefactory.  His prodigy should 
wo rk a s a
 
--
 
no, thatdidn't go.W ell, I was disappointed, but things changedpretty soon. As I 
said, Iarrived in February and in September
 
--
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, can I ask you one question bef ore you go there?  At s
om e  
point
 
--
 
well, soonaf ter you got there, you changed your nam ef romHeinz.
 
Henry Kahn: Oh, yeah, that was another thing.  Mr.
 
and Mrs.
 
London, or Mr.
 
London, I 
don't know who, they said to me, well, Heinz is not really a good nam e.  Although there'sH
einz 
57, you know, the ketchup. 
 
(Laughter)
 
But no,that's not good.  You have to changeyour name.  So If igured well, a crim inal 
thatI read inbooks.  Im ean, I was 16 yearsold, the crim inals they usually chased the sam e 
initial, I didn't want to do that. So consequently I chose Peter. Peteris a nam e in English as 

well as in Germ an andconsequently it suitedm e.  So I chose it. W henm y mother heardabout 

it, she said I don't like this atall.  But I guess if  Mrs.
 
London wants it, then it has to be. 
 
I couldn't 
answer that,but it wasn't that way.
 
Bill Benson: And Henry, of course,atthat time you were able to writ e to your parents 
andthey wrote to you.
 
Henry Kahn: Yes, yes, that I coulddo. The war hadn't started yet. 
 
Bill Benson: And then of  course inSeptem ber of  1939, the war begins.
 
Henry Kahn: I know, I know. W ell, this is another thing.  InSeptem ber '39 the war 
began and imm ediately Mr.
 
London toldme he's going to evacuate thefam ily.  And since 
I  
--
 
oh, yeah, thenI got a perm it
 
--
 h
e  go t  a p er m i t
 
--
 
a worker's perm it, apprentice perm itand I 
was getting one pound a week, which is 20 shillings.  I said to him ,don't give me thatm uch.  I 

live in your house and all that, Idon't needthatm uchmoney now. He saidoh, that's okay.  20 

s
hillings, it's okay.  I guess it was the law in England. I didn't know.  So the war brokeoutand 

thefam ily, we evacuated.  And he
 
--
 
Mr.
 
Londontoldm e, since you are working, you have to 
lookf ora place. SoI found aplace, we lived in Hampstead Garden, which is a f ancy 

neighborhood, they had their own private hom e, et cetera, et cetera, and it wasn'tfarf rom  

Ham pstead Heatha big m eadow where I we nt quiteof ten and justdream t. I hadnom oney, as 

I mentioned before,although I got a little bitthere,a pound a week andI saved it very 

conscientiously because I knew I needed money to get to the United States.  Ihad to lookfor a 

placeandI went to Finsbury Park.  It was amiddle class typeof neighborhood. T he schoolwas 

notfar away f rom where I lived. T here was asynagogue notfarf rom  where I lived, so that was 

ver y convenient.  Andacross the street Im etaf ellow with who I was f riendly until he passed 

away a f ew years ago.  His name was Lou.  So now that Ihad tom ove, I said to Mr.
 
L on don ,  
now you
 
--
 
I like to work in the sewing
 
--
 
in the sewing room . And this tim ehe couldn't say no 
because, you know 
--
 
buton theother handI also askedhim to give m e som em ore money.  
Oh, no, you can'thave that because other boys your age don't get any m ore either.  Now, it was 

different if  you live with them for nothing or if  you have tohave your own room . W hat Ihad to 

pay was 14 shillings and six centsa week.
 
Bill Benson: Outof  your 20. Out of your 20 shillings, you had to pay 14 shillings out o
f 
your 20 shillings.
 
Henry Kahn: Yeahout of  20. Sothat wasn'texactly good either.  So I hadto get
 
--
 
s o I  

8 
 
learned how to sew.  And after a short time If igured I'd go into piecework to work to pay f or 
eachpiece which I com plete. And there I was able to make30 shillings, 50% more thanwhat I 

hadbefore. And thatwas already a little bitbetter.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, can I jum p in and read som ething that you shared with m e?  During 
thattim e you were called bef ore a tribunaland your record said theholderof  this certif icate is to 

be exemptedf rom further orderf rom internmentbecause you weref rom  Germany andf rom  the 

special restrictions applicable to enem y aliens, because you were f rom  Germany, under the 

aliens order.  Andthen they added, in late
 
1939 they added that you were a ref ugeef rom  Nazi 
oppression. Sothat shouldhave protected you.
 
Henry Kahn: Okay.  But when well, that wasa little later.  It wasn't right afterthe war 
broke outbecausef irst I was really quiet andnothing m uch happened, althoughthere was an 

area allowedbut rightafter Mr.
 
Chamberlainhaddeclared war on Germ any.
  
Af ter the war Churchill had writtenf ive volum es, the second world war and in one of the 
volum es he showed how the precariousthe situation was in England and the Brittsdidn't get 

scared, they got panicky.  And when they got panicky, then they decided to intern the lot, 

including ref ugeesf rom  Nazi oppression.  Now, I'd like to give you an idea what it was like by 

read ago little excerptbyW inston Churchill had written atthe time. Between 1940 and '45 

W inston Churchill had collected hism em oir and notes and letters and used it to write six 

volum es on the second world war and now I'm  quoting. "W e couldnot regardthe state of 

without uneasiness. We knew thatdisguised merchant ships in unknown numbers were 

preying on all borders. The enorm ous disprop
ortion between the num ber of  riders and the force 

of  the Adm iralty had to deploy to cordon them and guard
 
--
 
guard the im mense traff ic that had 
been displayedpreviously.  Had tobe ready atm any points and give protection tothousands of  

m erchant vessels andcould give no guarantee againstoccasional lamentable disasters. Afar 

greater danger was addedto these problem s.  Theonly thing that ever really f rightenedm e, 

andthat was Mr.
 
Churchill saying that, was during the world war now our lif elineeven a
cross 
thebroad oceansandespecially theentrance to the island were endangered.  How m uch 

would
 
--
 
how m uch would U
-
boats inf luence our portand shipping. Only the linesand charts 
would show potential triangulations. T he high andf aithf ul spirit of  the peopleand the bleak 

domaineither thefoodsuppliesf rom the new world as the em pire arrived across the oceanor 

they failed.  So now you see why they got panicky over there.  In any case, this was af ter 

Dunkirk where theBritish Expeditionary Force had
 
been encircled by the Germans and all 
300,000 British soldiers and French were able to get toEngland.  However, all the equipment 

was lost and you can im aginehow
 
--
 
how the peoplefelt. Of course everything was rationed 
andthere was ver y, very, ver y, ver y strongl y r ationed andthey had very little to eat.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, after
 
--
 
after the Nazis took Franceand Hollandandthe lowlands, 
you heardonthe radio an announcem ent that aliens should report to thepolice.  You heard 

th a t.
 
Henry Kahn: Oh
,  ye s .
 
Bill Benson: So whatdid thatm eanfor you?
 
Henry Kahn: It was wr itten, it's a two
-
day holiday in England and Idecided since I hadn't 
seenanything of England except going
 
--
 
coming to work, I decided to go on abicycle trip to 
Oxf ord. And I got
 
there, but everything was closed. SoI went into a bed and breakf ast place 
and stayed therefor one night.  I wanted tom eet af riend of m inewho li ved outside of Oxf ord.  

So that's what I did. That's what I cam efor.
 
I slept in thathouse
 
--
 
i n  t ha t  bo
arding housefor one night,and the next m orning Iheard 

9 
 
on the radio allalienshave to report to thepolice.  So Iasked the
 
--
 
the lady where thepolice 
station was.  So she said why?  I toldher. So she saidtom e, well, I thought you were Irish.
 
(Laughter)
 
But I wasn't.  And I went to the police.  I told them what the problem was.  T hey told me 
just go back and it will be all right. All right.  So I rodeback. T hen I foundoutthat a lot of 
acquaintancesof m ine were being interned and Ifeltm y turn was going to com e also.  Sowhat 

I did,I took all them oney which I had, I took it to theBloom sbury House, it was responsible for 

the Kindertransport and the kids in the Kindertransport and Itoldthem , this is all them oney I 

have.  Please getm e out 
as fast as possible and get m e
 
--
 
getm e a ticket to get to the United 
States.  So she toldme, well, it isn't quite enough, but we'll m ake up the difference, which was 

gre a t. 
 
W ell, it turned out a little different.  I wentback.  I insisted that I geta 
certif icate f or 
my
 
--
 
f rom the com pany I worked f or, thename of the com pany was Londonhouse.  I got the 
c e r t i f i c at e af t er  p us h ing.   I  c am e  hom e
 
--
 
sure enough,I just got the certif icateand I just cam e 
home andthe land lady told methe police were just
 
here, you should com eand get your stuff  
and gotom orrow to the police station.W ell,tomorrow I went to thepolice station with allm y 

stuff . I have a suitcase.  I was imm ediately interned.  Now, that was the 3rd of  July, 1940. W e 

we r e
 
--
 
all the peoplewho were interned slept onenight in a race course outside of London, 
also in tent cam ps,of  course,and then thenext day we were gi ven a big piece of cheese and 

puton thetrain. All day long we were on that train until we f inally landed in Liverpool
, t he  W est  
Coast port inEngland.W e were takenoff and landed in a cam p, ina tent camp which f rom  the 

a ir lo o k s  lik e
 
--
 
like enem y Arm y cam pof course except there was barbed wire around it. 
 
T hen we were told theweek bef oreLiverpoolhadbeen bom bed and also thatthe 
Arandora star, it was a ship thathad takenprisoners into Canada had beentorpedoedand 

shot. And after thatnews we were asked who wants to volunteer to go to an overseas 

dom inion.  Ihad no idea what an overseas dom ainI don't know was.   If igured if  it was Canada 

they would have said so.  Andthen I scratched m y headand wondered, should I takea chance 

with a torpedo or should I stay here and takea chance in the
 
--
 
in the Nazis com ing over and 
bombing usand all that?  So Idecided I'd take a chance with the torpedo wouldn't last too long. 
 
W ell, Itook a chance.  And I decided.  And so for six
 
--
 
f ive days after we arri ved in the 
cam p, we were takenon HMT Dunera which was a ship thatprovidedf acilitiesfor 1,500 

soldiers. T he prisoners of  war was over 2,500, so you can im aginewhat the situation was like.  

W egotaboard the ship and all our luggage was put on the centerof  the topdeckand a canvas 

was put over it.  I was in the bottom
 
--
 
bottom  deck.  In the f ront of  the ship.  T h
e s h i p  lef t
 
--
 
le ft 
theport the very sam e night and was pitchingand rolling like crazy.  And I didn't think therewas 

any storm butI couldn't tell you.  Had no way of  looking outor anything.  As it turned out, the 

ship tried to avoid torpedoes.  T hat's
 
why they were pitching and rolling.  A torpedo hit, made a 
dent into the ship, butdid not explode. So you can im agine. W ell of course I didn't know that 

im mediately, but If ound it out eventually.
 
Now quick l y, 22 years laterm y wif e,m y two sons,and I
 
m et m y f ormer teacher f rom  the 
W aldorf School in New York.  Andaf ter meeting him  several tim es,he toldme, you know in '38 

when we were f iredf rom  the W aldorf  School I got a job ina torpedofactory andonce in a while 

I put sand inthe
 
--
 
into the cani
sters. I said whatm ade you take such a chance? I wantedto 
play a trick on the Nazis.  So thank you, Mr.
 
Hagar. 
 
Bill Benson:  You know, Henry, our time is getting short and there's
 
--
 
I know there's 
things you want to share with us and there'ssom e things I wanttom ake sure you tell us. If  you 

10
 
 
don'tm ind, youm entioneda few m inutes ago that all of your luggage was piled in them iddle.
 
Henry Kahn: Yeah.
 
Bill Benson: And that included the letters you had gottenf rom  yourparents.  
 
Henry Kahn:  Oh, 
ye s .
 
Bill Benson: So tell uswhat happened to the luggage.
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, every day all of  us wentfor a walk, walk or running on the deck back 
andforth, machine gun oneither side to put
 
--
 
to protect. T he canvas had beentaken off and 
the soldiers
 
helped them selves to whatever they wantedbecausethese soldiers who were 
guarding us were notexactly the cream of  the crop because they we re needed in England. So 
they threw stuff  overboard asm uch as possible.  And it so happened that another torpedo 
boat 

was f ollowing us andthe captain asked to pick up some of the debris that was thrown 

overboard and there were Germ an letters so they left usalone. So there was another good 

incident.  It was a crim inal offense. They eventually got court
-
martialed.
 
Bill Benson: The crew, yeah, the officers of your ship got court
-
m artialed.
 
Henry Kahn: Theoff icer who was in charge of  the soldiers got court
-
m artialed after the 
wa r .
 
Bill Benson: And Henry, the ship, as I remember, the ship sailed towards Canada, got
 
close to Canada.
 
Henry Kahn: Yes.
 
Bill Benson: And then reversed itself.
 
Henry Kahn: Then it went south around the Capeof  Good Hope and landed afterone 
anda half m onths in Sydney, Australia. W ewere taken off over there and taken18hours into 

the 
inte rio r.  Afte r
 
--
 
after having taken
 
--
 
after having arri ved in anew cam p, it was brand new, 
the sand was blowing l ike crazy, and we were sandblasted.W e wore shorts. W efelt the sand 

blowing against our legs. T he next morning out of 2,500, 13 names were called out andm ine 

was thef irst one on that list. And when we got back
 
--
 
when we
 
--
 
we were called to the orderly 
room and we were told we go back toSydney.  And som ebody told us
 
--
 
oneof  the soldiers 
talked, these chapsare going back to England. W ell, that was not our choice, but Ihad no 

control over it. W ell, it tookus oneanda half
 
--
 
well, the ship lef t ten days later.
 
Bill Benson:  Did you know why you were goi ng back to England after all that journey?
 

Henry Kahn: No, I didn't.
 
B ill 
Benson:  You didnot know.  Okay.
 
Henry Kahn: I didn't know at all.  So after two weeks, Im ean it took us oneand a half  
m onths to get to Australia.  After two weeks we were takenoff theship, the 13of  us, andwe 

were taken to the police stationand everyone was being intervie wed by a policeoff icer. And 

thefellow askedm eall sorts of stupid questions. T he last questionhe asked, where do you 

live?  I said Idon't even know where I am  and you askm e where I live? W ell,hehadtof ind 

out. And they
 
found out that we were going to live in the Jewish Relief Association in Bombay, 
India.  So that's where we were.  And the reason thathappened was because the release which 

I had triedtoorganize before I was interned cam e too late to stop itfrom being
 
sent on the 
s h ip
 
--
 
put on the shipbut it reachedm e when If inally was in Australia and that's how I got out. 
I lived in India until theendof  the war and cam eto theStates in '46.
 
Bill Benson: So whenyou left Australia, it was to go back to England but instead they 
dropped youoff  in Bom bay, India.
 
Henry Kahn: Right. W ell, the reason they did that was because there was a troop ship 
andthe troop ship had to accomm odate soldiers to go to the MiddleEast to f ight.
 

11
 
 
Bill Benson: So they just dumped you off in Indiaand
 
--
 
Henry Kahn: Exactly.
 
Bill Benson: So whatwas it like to justf ind yourself  inIndia?
 
Henry Kahn: Exactly. 
 
(Laughter)
 
Bill Benson: So then you hadtom ake a living and support yourself.  You were living in 
India.
 
Henry Kahn:  W
ell, no, I didn't have to do that. T he Jewish Relief Association, 
they
 
--
 
they fedus andwe li ved there,four
 
--
 
four of the boys,f our of us boys li ved in one 
bedroom and it was quite an interesting experience,I can assure you.  And eventually I got a 

job, a night shiftf oreman. But there were lots of  other stories inbetween.  But that takes too 

long though.
 
Bill Benson: OneI want you to tell us is thatyou, of  course,once the war began, you 
had lost all contact with your parents.
 
Henry Kahn: Oh, yes, I couldn't getanything.  I only f ound out when I worked at the 
Holocaust Museum  what happened tom y
 
--
 
whatprobably happened to m y parents.  My f ather, 
I know. T hey kept very good records of  it.  Butm y m other, Ihave no idea.  Actually I do have 

a
n idea. She lived till '44 and wasf orce marchedto
 
--
 
they internedin Poland and they had a 
forced m arch going
 
--
 
when the Russian troops cam e,theyf orced
 
--
 
the Germans forced 
internees, theprisoners to walk back towards Germany.  But beforethey got
 
to Germany, that I 
found outf rom the Holocaust Museum , theywere
 
--
 
they stopped bef ore they crossedthe 
Germ an border. They were forced to dig their own gra ves andthen they were killed, shot.T hat 

wa s
 
--
 
that's what happened tom y m other,m ost likely.  And she was the one who was 
orthodox.  That turned som ehow.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, if I rem em ber correctly, at some pointbefore your motherandf ather 
were sent toLodz they got word that you were okayf rom  af riendof yours.
 
Henry Kahn: Oh, yes. W ell,
 
in '35 I
 
--
 
that was before all theproblem s. I was in a 
summ er hom e inGermany and there Im et aboy who was
 
--
 
who I became very f riendly.  And I 
liked him very m uch. And we were in constant touch.  Im et him  again in the States. Im et him  

in England, India,because he was a soldier by then andhe was
 
--
 
he was sent to India.  And 
while I m ethim , Im ethim  for three days, hefound out thathis mother had died. So it'sbad.  

But anywa y, this boy, when I cam e to India,a gentlem an in thehom e, he was leaving for the 

United States and I asked him  to contact m yf riend Eric, which he did.  And Eric onhis own 

wrote a letter tom y parents to let them  know that I'm okay becausethey had completely lost 

touch with m ebecause they knew I wasn't inEnglandanym orebut they didn't know what had 

happened tom e.  So that's it.
 
Bill Benson: So they at least knew that you were
 
--
 
they at least knew you were saf e 
som ewhere.
 
Henry Kahn: That's right.  I was alive som ewhere, that they could know, that's right.
 
B ill B
enson: So Henry, you would spend therest of the war in India.
 
Henry Kahn: Yes, until '46. But while I was in India, Im et m y
 
--
 
a f riend of  m ine took me 
to
 
--
 
toa sports club, Maccabi sports club in Bom bay.  And there was a young lady who played 
P in g
-
Pong.  And I liked to play Ping
-
Pong, too.  But she beat m e almost all the tim e.
 
(Laughter)
 
So Ihad to get even with her.  So what do you think I did?  Right. But that tooka long 
tim eand was ver y diff icult because she was born inIndia. She
 
--
 
her par
en t s  c am e f r om  

12
 
 
Europe, too. But shewas born in Indiaandas such she didn't have apossibility of getting a 
Visa to get
 
--
 
to live here.  So while I was in uniform I went to the State Departm ent andasked 
t h em
 
--
 
I learned in the
 
--
 
in theArm y there are
 
three ways of  doing things.  The right way, the 
wrong wa y, and the Arm y wa y.  And the Army wa y is the way it goe s.  So I said to them af ter 

we went throughall the possibilities, I was married, I was an Am erican citizen at that tim e. I 

said maybe you can
 
do som ething to getm y wife over here. Sureenough, very shortly 
thereafter, she was asked to com eto the consulate in Bom bay.  She was workin g across the 

streetf rom there.  Andthey asked her,do you want to go to the United States? They saidoh, 

ye s .
  
He r V is a
 
--
 
her aff idavit hadexpired, but all of a sudden this was washed away and then 
thenext day she was
 
--
 
she said yes, I still want to go to the UnitedStates. T he next day she 
was called over again.W hendo you want togo?  So she said well, I
 
have to give noticef irst.  
So she did.  Andaf ter two and ahalf  years ofhaving written 117 letters to eachother, both of  

us, she arrived on the 9th of June, 1948, andon the27th we became husband and wife. And 

lived happily ever af ter.
 
(Laughter)
 
Bi
ll Benson: And the only reason you went two weeks is because you had to go to a 
wedding in between those two weeks, right?
 
Henry Kahn: Yes.
 
Bill Benson: So that was the only reason you delayed two weeks.
 
Henry Kahn: That's why it took two weeks.
 
B ill B
enson: W hen you cam e to the UnitedStates youhad had $10.  Is that right?
 
Henry Kahn: Yes, I had
 
--
 
I owned$10.  But I had $50 with m e.  My f riend had given to 
m eto give to his brother.  So I hadthat money available.  AndI had to use
 
--
 
(Laughter)
 
I  
had to use it but eventually I gave it back tohis brother, of course. But the$10
 
t he  
f e llo w
 
--
 
thef ellow on the ship that tookus exactly onem onth to com ef rom India to the United 
States on the ship. W e landed in
 
--
 
in New Jersey and there was onefellow who always s erved 
us f ood.  I felt I had to gi ve som e tip.  So I gave him  5
 
b u cks to
 
--
 
Bill Benson:  Half your m oney.
 
Henry Kahn: Yeah,and then somebody
 
--
 
som ebody helpedm e with m y
 
--
 
with m y bag.  
I  h ad
 
--
 
I hada coupleof  bags and then I got
 
--
 
I got onshore Ihad to give them a tip, too. But I 
had no m oney
 
--
 
I didn't want to give any money so I gave him m y helm et and he was ver y 
happy with it.
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, I think we m ight have timef or oneor two questions bef ore we close.  
Is th at
 
okay? W e'll take one or two questions.  And we have am icrophones,one on each side.  
W eask if  you have a question, wait until youhave am icrophone.  Make your 

question
 
--
 
please, if you can
 
--
 
asbrief  as you can.  I will repeat it so that Henry and e
verybody 
else can hear it andthen he'll respond to your question. SoI saw som e handsbackthere.  

T here we go. 
 
Audience Mem ber:  You said youhad changed your nam ef rom Heinz to Peter.  But now 
you go by Henry.  So when did you changefrom  Peter to Hen
r y?
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, yo u changed your namefrom  Heinz toPeter but you're Henry today.  
W hen did you leave Peter behind? 
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, Peter I didn't
 
--
 
once I got out of  England, I didn't call m yself  Peter 
anym ore. Then you called m yself  Henry.
  
T hat's all.  It was quite simple. 
 
(Laughter)
 

13
 
 
Bill Benson: Been Henry ever since.  Okay.  T hank you. Do we have onem ore? There 
we go. W e've got a couple in the back.  Okay. 
 
Audience Mem ber:  Henry
 
--
 
Henry Kahn: You want to askm e any question afterwards, you can come up.
 
Bill Benson:  Yes, yes,thank you, Henry.  Henry's going to stay when we're f inished. 
W e'renot quite there yet.  He will stay on thestage.  So anybody wh o wants to come up and 
ask him a question, shake hishand or whatever, please know that you're welcom e todothat 

when we f inish. Hold thoseother questions. 
 
Audience Mem ber:  Henry, you mentioned what you believe happened to your mother.  
W hat happened to your father?
 
Bill Benson:  Henry, yo u told us what you believe happened
 
to your m other. W hat do 
you believe happenedto yourf ather?W hatdo you believe happened to yourfather?
 
Henry Kahn: My f ather
 
--
 
they kept very goo d records.  He was in Lodz also but he got 
sick.  He went to the hospitalandhedied there.  Idon't know exactly what happened, but this is 

what I was told in the
 
--
 
in the Holocaust Museum, right here.
 
Bill Benson: And that was after he wasf orced into the Lodz ghetto. He was forced into 
theLodz ghetto and there he died in theLodz ghetto.
 
Henry Kahn:
  
Y e s .   O ka y.
 
Bill Benson: Thank you.
 
Henry Kahn: Now I have a
 
--
 
want to say som ething.
 
Bill Benson: Okay.  Your last word? W e're not there yet, quite yet.We'll go onem ore 
question andthen we'll get there.
 
(Laughter)
 
W e'realm ost there. You're pu
nctual.
 
Henry Kahn: All right.
 
( Laughter ) 
 
Audience Mem ber: T hank you, Henry, f or sharing with us.  Question about your father 
being released afterone month. W hydo youthink he was releasedaf ter onemonthf rom  

Dachau?
 
Bill Benson: The question is why do you think your f ather was released after one month 
f rom  Dachau? W hy was he released?
 
Henry Kahn:W ell, lots of people were released at that tim e.  It was just initially to give 
them  a shock, I guess.  And encouragepeople to get out of Germ any.  I
 
don't know wh y it was.  
B u t it wa s
 
--
 
it wasn't that terrible yet.  It gotworse by the day.
 
Bill Benson: And Henry used the word " encourage."   Many of  those who were released 
af ter Kristallnacht were basically told, we'll release youbut you have to leave Germany.  And so 
m any, of course, tried to find ways to do that. I want to rem ind you that we will have a
 
F i rs t  
Person
 
program eachW ednesday and Thursday through them iddle of  August, so hope that 
you can return and join us at that tim e.  Henry's going to give us his last word in them om ent 

because it'sour tradition thatour
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
has the last word. But I would like you to wait 
until you leave because our photograph Joel is going to com euponthe stage and take som e 
video of  Henry with yo u in
 
thebackground so that will be ver y exc iti ng for him tohave.  So 
please bear with usf or that.  So as I said, it'sour tradition that our
 
F irs t  P e rs on
 
has the last 
word. 
 
Henry Kahn: Okay.  If you know som ebody who you hate, you havever y good reasonto
 
hate that personand do not makethe m istake of  generalizing.  In other words, the 

14
 
 
sa m e 
--
 
person with the sam ebackground isnotnecessarily the sam etype of person andit's 
ver y im portant.  You see, I could hate, and Ido hate the Nazis, as you can well
 
im agine, but if  it 
had
 
--
 
bu t  i t  i s  f o r Mr.
