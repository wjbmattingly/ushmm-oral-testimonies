AVA DORFMAN 
April 18, 1995 
 
Question:  Ca n you tell us your name
 and where you were born and when? 
Answer:  Yes. I was born in 1920, the 30th of April in ____________ Poland.  Then we lived 
there for a while. 

Q. What was your name  at birth? 

A. Ava Mueller.  And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to 

concentration camp asked me , you could not be Jewi
sh because my na me is Mueller, and I said 
ma ybe I 'm not, but it didn't  help me  t oo much. 
 It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so 
very similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same. 

Q. What is your name  now? 

A. My name  now is Ava Dorfman.  That is my
 husba nd of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988, 
on July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly. 

Q. You were born in _____________? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Did you stay there for very long? 

A. I suppose we  stayed until a certain age. 
 I think I went to public school, already to 
Parochial at that time.  There was a church w
ith a parochial school near our house.  I attended 
there.  Then my mother --. 

Q. Excuse me .  Was that unusual for a Jewish person to attend that school? 

A. There were only two or thr
ee Je wish people in the area wher
e I lived, so, we were really 
very removed from the Jewish section of ______
_____.  Then, my mother had family in Vienna, 

so a portion of my life I spend th
ere, and I lived on Liechtenstein
 Strauss in Vienna.  Then, my 
father's fa mi ly lived in _________, and my mother 
felt that I and my sist
er Ruzia who was 2 1/2 
years older than I, that we s
hould some how be closer to the fa
mily, to know our grandparents.  
She did not have too mu ch fa mily in Poland or in
 Vienna of her close, and then we mo ved back

to ________________, where my gr andparents own a building, four story, and my gra ndfather 
had a restaurant, and they lived in the lower le
vel, and then on the second floor, my mother, 
Ruzia and I, you see when I was six months old I lo
st my father, so I actually never knew him.  
There was just a study where there was a drawing, 
and that drawing was my father.  There were 
pictur es that my mother always 
showed.  He wa s 27 years of age and developed a severe case of 
kidney problems.  He just got hi
s degree in civil engineering.  
My mother was only 25, and they 
looked forward but he didn't survive.  So, 
between the draw and the cemetery that my 
grandmother took us alwa ys, that was what I know 
of father.  I didn't envy anyone that they ma y 

have had mo re ma terial things, but
 I envy everyone who was able to 
sit on the father's lap or get 
a kiss from a father.  That some how I mi ssed always. 

Q. What do you reme mber about your mother? 

A. My mother was very pretty, very educated. 
 She spoke five languages.  We were just -- 
when we grow up we were like sisters, but wh
en she was some ti me s saying, I'm only 28 years of 

age, I said "Well, you're so old."  But we all 
do that, and she worked in
 the brewery, which was 
very big offices, as an interpreter and also as a 
executive secretary to a director name d Rightma n.  

He was Jewish, and then I understand from anot
her friend, who is a gynecologist that the other 
director's son, Shal, was his name , is some place 
in the United States, and then I was befriended, 

ma ybe she was my best friend was Shisko.  They
 were Czechoslovakian decent, and she and I 
went together in school, and as I will tell you la
ter on, she played a ma jor role in my life.  And 

my mother worked there, and so it was a necessa
ry that we were with 
the grandparents together 

and then above us was another aunt.  She had four
 children.  Marguerita wa
s so pretty.  They all 
perished.  Then there was another aunt 
who was childless, _______________ and then she was 
just like a mother.  She was battling a cancer in 
her larynx and that was th
e time really that she 
wanted to see that we would be ma rried so sh
e could see the weddings.  I think that's what 
prompted one time whatever I will tell you about. 
 What I would like to sa
y that it is so hard 
some ti me s to comprehend when people speak of 
six million, and also the 
fact that one million 
and a half were innocent children, do
es not say that we all were not 
just innocent, justly paid just  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317

because we were Jewish.  The fact that everyone of
 the six million was a pe rson with loved ones,    
with friends, with dreams for the future, and th
en they had to face death by whatever means 
those murderers had for them.  They had a grea
t ma ny of them.  Then, since you spoke with me  
and I really tried to search my 
mi nd.  I must have really, like excavating the back me mories from 
my brain, and reach so ma ny gruesome  stories, that I 
tried very hard to suppress.  I know that lots 
of Holocaust survivors share those gruesome  stor
ies with their children.  I don't know what effect 

that had on them, but before I got ma rried in the Un
ited States, I decided if I ever have a fa mily, I 
would like to establish as a nearly normal life as 
it can be.  I didn't want my children to be sorry 
for their mother.  I didn't want them to have th
e feeling that they are di fferent from the other 
children, so I really was very evas
ive about it.  The only thing at ni
ght, I had very bad dreams, as 
my husband was telling me .  I some t i me s screamed 
or just said don't let them take me .  So I 
shared lots of things 
with my husband, and not 
until the children were in high school and there 
were ma ny documentaries shown on T.V. and the 
newspapers and they always asked, "Mom do 
you know anything about it?  Have you been there? " 
 And then little by littl
e I would just tell 
them, not very much.  I have been asked by so 
many organizations to speak about my  past.  I 

refused it.  The only time  I spoke was the Luther
an Church, and that was only because that the 
mi nister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran
 is going to go to hell 
and of course, I just 
thought I'd tell them what hell really was.  That
's  the only place I spoke.  But, I feel right now 
that even my children encourage me  that I shou
ld give testimony.  Just like my son called me  
yesterda y and he said, "Good luck Mom.  I thi
nk you owe to the younger generation, because it 
should never be forgotten what happened."  I pe
rsonally being so attuned to the anti-semitism 
which is going right now on, not only in Germany, 
France or England, but in the United States.  
I'm scared for the future gene
ration because just like I hope th
at the Holocaust in Was hington 
Museum or any other Museums or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million 

will be able to educate the people what hatred 
and bigotry can do, and what they ha ve  done even 
to homosexuals and lesbians.  They tortured th
em, and it was just because they had other sex 
preferences.  We  should let the people live for what 
they are, and therefore 
I feel that I consented 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317

to it.  But I have to tell you that the last 
two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm 
pretty sure I'm down to ma ybe 80.  
I  can hardly eat or sleep.  It's
 hard for me  to sleep.  There 
come s some thing that one son knows about and the ot
her son still doesn't .  When I was in Vienna 
I me t ma ny people, but one in particular was a me di
cal student.  He was like
 five and half or six 
years older than I.  He visited us when we went
 back to Poland.  Then, as I me ntioned, my aunt 
who was childless, she was very eager to have 
a wedding, especially at that time , the rumors 

what was going on in Germany, because I think ha
d in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution 
already in Ge rmany, and at one point I heard my fa mily speaking, oh he's just a ma niac.  They 

don't let him succeed.  They will st op him.  But how wrong they were.  So, at one point, my aunt 

entert aine d that ma ybe we will get married.  His fa mily was not very well to do and neither  was 

mi ne.  He found a position in ____________.  ______________ was near _______________ 

which was a port, and in September of '
39 the German invaded or bombed ____________.  This 
is the time that my marriage was of seven 
months only.  That's  why I do not have any 
recollection.  We  hardly knew 
each ot her as a ma rried couple. 
Q. How long did you know him before getting ma rried? 

A. I think around four years. 

Q. What was his name ?  

A. Edmond Spr itzer (ph).  When the 
German started to bomb _____________, and they 
finally ma rched in from ___________, they start to
 round up the Jewish young me n, able bodied, 
and that would happen with Mungio, and since the
n, I never saw him.  I never had a trace of it 
neither.  I have me t any of his fa mily me mbers 
of his family.  My cousin, who lives now in 
England, her son is by the way a me mber of the Pa
rliame nt from Wales.  They did not stay with 
Judaism, and he was born as a Episcopalian, but 
I don't blame them.  The r e were many times that 
I didn't know what to do.  If I were to have a fa
mily, I would not want them to be exposed to 
what I went through.  She and her mother 
were visiting ______________, a
nd my mother by the 
way was visiting me , and the panic was so 
great because it was on the Baltic, ____________.  It 

was a resort also.  Everybody tr
ied to get inland, and also reac
h their homes.  What vividly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
5 
 
stayed in my  mi nd after search
ing my  me mory that I pushed my mother in through a window 
because the train was so jammed that she 
can go and _____________ also in some  way was able 
to place her mother and then she and I stayed 
a while there.  We didn't have any possessions 
there, but when it start to be very bad, she was ma rried around three years to 
Doctor____________ and they were located where he
 practiced, and she and I decided that 
ma ybe we ought to go to her home. 
 That progressed so quickly.  Th
ey started to bomb the trains, 
and we were just having the hardest time  to 
go to Warsaw which was by plane ma ybe an hour 
and a half.  It took us four days to go to Wa rsaw.  When we came there, her husband 

_____________, said, look they are alre
ady progressing here.  They are vandalizing, even the 
Polish people vandalizing Jewish home s.  I thi
nk it would be wise if you and Ava start to ma ke 
your way to _________.  That's  where her parents lived
 and my mother and Ruzia, and her father 
was a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner. 
 It took us twelve days
, ten or twelve days.  
Everytime the train was bombed, we  had to ju
mp, no ma tter how high the train was into the 
embarkment .  We were bleeding all over.  Our cl
othes were torn.  We  di
dn't  have food.  But 
when we stopped, there happened to be a little 
town.  The people came out and said, what is 
going on.  Tell us where they are, and brought so
me  food out to us.  When we find, as you know 
at that time  the Germans invaded Poland there 
was the agreement between
 the foreign mi nister 
of Ger many ___________ and ___________ who was the fore
ign mi nister from Stalin's, from 
Russia, from the Bog River east of the Bog River 
the Russians will invade that portion of Poland.  
That of course was this camp ______.  So
 when we ma de our way to ______________, she was 
financially better situated so they lived in a co
mpletely different area, and I lived on the front 
area.  As a ma tter of fac t , when we were
 in Wa rsaw, they took only possession, a __________ 
and it was lucky.  That was the only thing we c
ould cover ourselves at night, because we didn't 
have anything else.  I did not ma
ke a contact with her until after 
the war.  I did not know what 
happened to her.  If you are interested I w
ill tell you about it, but when I reach __________, my 
mother quickly put me  into the baseme nt because
 I don't remember if there were passports, or 
were they some types of documents that they 
had to be identified by because the Russians went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317

from one apartment or house to another to take 
a survey as to how ma ny people are there.  So, 
Mother was afraid that  they will arrest  me b
ecause I was the newcomer and they were already 
there.  So, through the co
ntacts of my  sister's  husband, who was _______________.  She was 
already married, he was a mathe matician and he
 was working, help the Russians, and he was 
able to get some  papers.  I don't know what they sa
id.  I know that I was able to come  out.  That 
time, the Russians confiscated lots
 of factories and took us to wo
rk, but I didn't feel good.  I felt 
that I was lightheaded.  I was 
sick to my stomach and did 
not know maybe malnutrition or 
whatever and Poland and that time was already soci
alized me dicine.  I we nt to see a doctor and 
found out that I was two or three months pregnant
.  I don't even reme mber.  To this day, I don't 
know how the pregnancy was not interrupted from
 jumping so many time s.  Sometimes we had 
to jump every fifteen mi nutes because the train wa
s so terribly bombed, and I just was pregnant.  
My grandparents were still alive at that time.  My
 grandfather in particul ar was religious.  My 
mother was very much for aborting the child, but 
my grandfather felt no.  So, I still was working, 
not too much food to begin with, and my sister
 was working, but she wa
s still livin
g with her 
husband, mo re near __________ which was more  of aJewish section.  She played beautifully 
piano, and her desire was one time to become  maybe
 a pianist.  I don't reme mber if she already 
had her son, Gaynish, but I know when the German
 came he was around a year and half out, so I 
will have to calculated it back.  Everyt hing is ju
st  like a ba d dream.  Howe ver, we were working, 
and I think I worked until my eight months, very 
hard because they did not let us stop.  I don't 
recall what we were doing, but I 
do recall that there wa
s like a quota.  If you didn't ma ke so 
ma ny pieces in one hour, they will push you to 
a very bad job, someti mes cleaning the worst 
toilets that you can imagine.  So
 I was very, very pressed, and not 
feeling well.  I was rushed out 
to a hospital to deliver, and she was a beautif
ul -- her name  wa s Lydia.  She was like 2 1/2 
months old and everybody thought she looked like an 
angle, but some how, due to the milk, there 
was not a formula or anything.  Nothing was ster
ilized, she developed dys
entery, like a very bad 
case of diarrhea, and the doctor hospitalized her.  
I went every day to the hospital after work, and 
they showed me  through a window because they 
felt it was a communicable disease.  But one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
7 
 
day I came and they didn't  show her and they say 
she's dead.  That was I think she was only three 
months or three and a half months old.  That t
ook lots and lots of ma neuvering really to get the 
body out so we can bury her near my  father, so she 
wouldn't be alone.  That 
was the end of that.  
But the Russian was not very 
easy to live under either.  They
 just unannounced would knock on 
the door, came and took whatever th
ey liked.  My mother had some
 nice china and they wanted it 
so it was not even would you give me.  I reme mb er be
ing just so attached to
 the drawing that that 
was my father and never knew him,
 but from the  pictures some ti me
s he stood at the foot of my 
bed and I could visualize him and I was a 
fan of his _____________ that he had a very nice 
__________ and of other literary writers and ph
ilosophers like Hiner Shuller, a ____________ 
ma n, and I thought one day I will have it in my 
home.  Well, it stayed 
there until the Germans 
came, but then they raped also some  people-- the Russians.  They also came and tortured you 

that tomorrow they come  and they emptied out
, but mostly they were like ________ and when 
they find our watches they just have like five 
watches on one hand and the 
other, they never had 
those things.  Or they took a nightgown from the  
women and just wear it as a dress.  They were 
very primitive.  My mot her felt that they in
terfere a lot in the war of ____________ and when we 
heard that eventually maybe the Germans come , 
my mother said, "It couldn't be worse."  But 
once again, she was wrong.  At least we were alive.
  Now, I spoke to a friend of mi ne who was 
very young when he left Poland.  He's  an orthopedi
st in our town, and I spoke to Andy Solenski, 

and I said, for some  reason as a ma tter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some 

reason I feel that the Germans attacked Russia and 
forced themselves into our terr itory that there 
was in 1939 -- excuse me  in 1941 that it was in June, because I reme mber that was my sister's 

birthday, and my mother 
baked a cake and asked _____________ and the little boy who was 
already alive, to come  and stay with me .  That
 same  night we heard shots and commotion and we  
run to the window and we saw the Russian soldie
rs running with ma ttres
ses under their arm and 
we knew some thing is brewing, and that's how the Russians went out, because the Germans 

came in.  Then, the other set of problems started.  
We were in our apartment still and I failed to 

say that my grandparents had a very hard time  wh
en the Russians were there.  When they got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
8 
 
drunk they came  to the restaurant and some ti me s 
with the bottles of liquor
 stayed and everything 
they would just push everything on th
e floor and just destroy it.  They
 took it very hard that they 
could not operate and support the 
whole family.  My grandmother 
took very ill and within one 
week of each other, they passed away.  My 
uncle who was my father's  brother, __________, his 
daughter is my cousin who lives 
in Pa ris, Nira, and is ma rried to a non-Jewish, but non-believer 
really, a Parisian artist.  She has a son Ste
phen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited 
Mitchell and I here last  year, and 
he continued to operate the restau
rant and we still lived in that 
house the whole family together.  But then they es
tablished a Ghetto and they start to line up the 
people and we had to leave everything be
hind, and my _____________ that I some how thought I 
was going to have that from my father, and we 
moved and I don't re me mb er the street.  There 
was a big building with lots of stories, three or 
four stories.  We moved to an apartment where 
one and a half rooms, two fa milies lived.  My mo
ther and I.  Ruzia was still there, and another 
fa mily with three children.  
It was very hard.  But when the Russians left, _____________, who 
were very religious.  The father had a b
eard.  The mother had a ___________.  I don't know what 
it is in English.  A wig?   I see.  They had 
a daughter who also by coincidence her name  was 
Rose.  Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosi
s.  She was unable to walk.  She was bedridden, 
and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund th
at still going back to the Russian occupation, 
encouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two 
brothers.  One of them now a year ago 
established contact 
with me  ________________, who by the way told me he saw my  sister's  
husband Zigmund after the war in Russia.  He encour
aged him to ma ke his way to Israel, but he 
knew he left my sister and a little child, and he told him he 's going to try to reach ___________.  

Evidently he never did, because _________ cannot put 
traces or find him,  and never reached us.  
Whatever, we were not there to be
gin with.  Then his father enc
ouraged us to come  and live in 
their house because they had a litt
le house, like four rooms.  And 
it was once again, very hard to 
get milk or bread or anything and he was going c
ourageously out trying to get some thing for his 
grandson.  One time when he left he neve
r came back, so when ____________ asked me  what 
happened to my father, the only estima te I could sa
y that they caught him or shoot him.  I don't  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317

know.  Then the mother did not know what to do w
ith her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her 
mi nd.  She was just going around the streets and scr
eaming, and they mu st have shot her because 

she never came back, and here I was with Mom, 
myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and 

Zigmund was already in the Russian Ar my and wh
en the Russians were moving away when the 
Germans came, they followed the Russian army a nd that's why he felt then it would be better to 

have the German people come .  We had both of the 
atrocities, and before we moved in with this 
other family, when I said that we lived in that 
building that had few stories, it's hard to believe 
how many people jumped to their death from thir
d or fourth floor.  I reme mber one prominent 
doctor who did it with hi s wife together because 
they didn't want to face what can happen to 
them. 

Q. Was this when the Germans came? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Did you see them?  

A. Yes.  So, that's  why whe n you asked me  to 
do that, after 50 years, wh
ich is a half century, 
to really delve into my me mory things that I try 
so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me .  
Then, we didn't have any money, and we didn't ha
ve any me ans to support ourselves and there 
was already the Germans.  I was wearing an arm ba
nd with the Star of David and J, Judea.  I took 
off my ar m band.  I was very bl
onde, long hair, they say blue ey
es.  I always thought I have 
green eyes, and I went to the other side to the br
ewery, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer.  It 
was very small, but I still feel that my wrists we
re very very affected by 
it.  I had surgery here 
and carpal tunnel, and I just went back and forth 
and sold the beer to the people who had money.  
Mama  was a ble to get a bushel of flour and ma ke
 some thing to eat for us.  Then the Germans 
took over the factories the same  that the Russian
s had, and we start to work there again.  But 
Ruzia was designed to clean the st reets, so she 
came a few times.  She was so delicate, so very 
pretty, and she said as long as th
e child is here, and we took care 
as best we can.  Mother didn't 
work anymore, and the brewery was taken over by 
the Germans.  One day she just didn't  come .  
One day just like the next day ma ybe came a Polish ma n.  He was a conductor of a trolley, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
10 
 
he knocked on the door and he asked for Ava and I said
 I am Ava, and he said that my sister is 
going to be taken to Auschwitz and she's so hungry. 
 She would like to have a piece of bread.  I 
asked him where they are going to ma rch the whol
e group of people, and he told me .  I took my 
armband off and went on the other side and stay
ed there while they were walking.  The me n 
looked like skeletons and they even picked up 
anything that wa s on the street.  Some times I 
wonder if it was even some thing fr
om animals, everything.  I saw 
Ruzia and I just run out and I 
don't know, there was a Ukrainian or some  Ge
r man Gestapo took my arm and they said 
_______________ and I said no, I'm Polish.  I throwed the 
bread to her and she said please take 
care of Gaynosh.  I never saw her again.  Then us
ually the Ge rman people used the young Jewish 
boy as the hatcher ma n.  They were always the ones to select some body or to take them 

some where and I know then from before or from sc
hool or some thing that we did together and at 
that time when it st arted to be
 so bad and one time I worked at the factory and there were 
different rooms and then I heard screaming like agony screaming, and I opened the door and 

there was a girl -- I don't know if she was 16 
or 17, and she was profusely bleeding like you 
would think some body had me nstrual bleeding.  She 
said, they raped me  with the foot of the 
stool.  Then I heard other screaming and then a 
Polish superintendent of 
that factory came  over 
and grabbed me  by the hand and he pulled me  
down to the baseme nt and that's how I got 
acquainted with the baseme nt.  The n, at that ti
me, I know I have to do some thing with Mom and 

Gaynosh.  I asked -- see in the Ghetto there was 
like a you have to go th
rough a gate where there 
were Germa ns and Ukrainians and the Jewish 
who were sort of going back and forth, the young 
me n.  At that time, I asked then if there was 
any possibility that I can get Gaynosh out of the 
Ghetto.  They said how, and I said we  just putsome thing in his mouth and see and I spoke with 

that Sishko, that from brewery, th
e director, and I was such a close 
friend with her, we nt together 
with her to school.  I told her th
at I would like to Gaynosh to her 
aunt who was without children.  
Maybe she will raise him.  She said let me talk. 
 Then when I came for the beer and she said try 
it.  I told her what day that would be and so
 with the armband -- you know there is like a wagon 
that you sit higher up and when you 
take the seat there is like 
a compart ment and the baby was

around here and ma ybe in three months over a year
 I reme mb er and just prior to the gate I 
stuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then 
they stopped us and they said ______________ and I 
said I have to testify because I saw some  Jewi
sh people doing some thing wrong and they take me  
to headquarter.  When we reach the ot her side, 
they couldn't go near the brewery, but they left 
me  off and I held a shawl over my head and the baby and somebody from the back stopped me  

and I said "yeah," and he said where are you goi
ng and I said home  with my baby.  Who are you, 
I say I am Polish.  What is your religion?   I sa
id catholic.  That's  what I don't know so ma ny 
things I was able to get away.  I don't know how.  
I placed the baby at that
 time with them with 
the understanding that after the war so me how so
me where I will get the 
baby.  Can I retreat?  
When I was in the house of __________, I had the 
baby and my mother and oh, by the way one 
time they come in the Germans and __________ that 
one that was bedridde
n and just took her 
out like a piece of garbage, and she was gone, whic
h was a bl essing.  Really, I could not lift her 
every day there was only me  and Mom.  There 
was no real life for her, but in this ____________ 
house I didn't  know it, but the neighbors who lived there for so ma ny yea r s, they know each 

other.  One time  a Jewish fa mily came and sa
id, you know there is a doo
r in the floor going to 
the cellar.  It was flush with the floor, but 
there were steps going down where evidently they 
pickled something for the winter, 
whatever.  It wa s like stor age 
room.  Could we hide?   We ll, 
they said if they catch us, we'r e all going to be
 dead.  We ll, it got so ba
d that they star ted to 
round up people and take them out to the concen
tration camp, I had 15 people in that cellar 
including my mo m and Gaynosh.  That was before.  
There wa s a bed and I seen him sitting there.  
They came, not only that they came, 15 people, bu
t ther e three children in the age of fi ve to 
ma ybe nine and I was so afraid that they ma y 
cry or say some thing loud.  So, I was upstairs and 
four or five Gestapo me n say ____________, 
everybody __________, and I said in German, 
there is nobody here, just me  and my child.  He
 said you go here you go th
ere and they stuck the 
top on the thing and for me  to tell 
them downstairs to sit quiet, 
I said, but there is no one here, 
but there is no one here.  There was silence a
nd then when the Gestapo grabbed Gaynosh and I 
said please don't do nothing to him and the other on
e said, let him sit we come some other time.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317

Then he said are you sure you're Jewish.  I said ma ybe not, but it didn't help me  too much, but 
then he threw an apple, I thought he  was going 
to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and 
some  candies and they left.  I asked once again, 
what a mi racle.  Then when I took out Gaynosh, 
I placed my mother with a neighbor that we us
ed to live way back where my grandfather's house 

was.  We  didn't have much, but ma ma  had such
 small little diamond earrings that evidently my 
father gave her when they were ma rried.  Don't fo
rget that Ruzia was 2 a
nd a half years older so 
they had some  ti me  together.  I th
ink her two rings and she wanted me  
to take it so I can survive.  
They say no, I want you to have that.  Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can 

buy food.  So we ma de like a pouch in her dress that
 she had.  We  couldn't take too much with 
us.  There were only two dresses that each one 
of us had and we sewed it underneath and that 
was what I left her.  My heart was some how easie
r because I took care of that.  Then, that didn't 
give me  too much time to really do some thing fo
r myself.  We were just taken in big cattle 

wagons in the concentration camps.  So, I found 
myself there towards the end of '41, 42, and 
what one saw in that concentration camp, it's really
 better to repress that . 
 One time, of course 
they had I think it wasrecreation for them.  Every time at 
night which were just bunk beds, no 

pillows, no sheets, no nothing, you just lie there, 
and roll calls.  When it 
was snowing or raining 
or thundering that you put your feet
 like that and sit with your 
head down and then they would 
with the rifles would point out you go to your ri
ght, you go to your left, you go to your right.  
You never know which one side is better.  Then one
 of them was to be just get away in some  
means.  Some ti me s they called it twice a night and 
then you had to get up at
 5:00 to go to work.  
Then they would give you soup which you could find not
hing in it.  One time  
they put us there to 
-- let me  say, when you came there, they shaved everyone. 

Q. This is _____________? 

A. Yanosko, Limberg.  They shaved us and then you hear this screaming because they asked 

everybody to open their mouths and they have like
 gold crowns, they just knocked it out, which 
was terribly painful.  They just undress us. 
 Men, wome n, children.  It was almost unhuma n.  
Then they pushed us to different barracks and when
 evening or at night when they built a fire and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
13 
 
there like a ____________ which was like a 
heap and then they put a big fire and while we were 
sitting there, you could see the fire.  It was not 
a recreational fire, it was 
quite a large area and the 
flames were going up and with their rifles they 
were pointing to people giving them instructions 
to dress, to undress, whatever there wa s, one
 gown you were wearing and to throw hims elf on the  
burning.  There was a mother a
nd a daughter sitting near me .  
I don't think the daughter ma ybe 
was 14 or 15 years of age.  He pointed out only
 to the mother and when the mother was still 
undressing, the daughter quickly 
got up and undressed and followed her, and ma ny ot hers 
perished the same  way.  Some times they would ta
ke us out and they would have those vicious 
dogs and when they found out that some body was a 
rabbi, I reme mber one was a priest even who 
tried to hide the Jewish children, and pushed 
the dogs and you could see how the flesh was 
comi ng off t hese people.  Some times  they hang the people and the Jewish boys who were in 
control.  I don't know if
 they could say no, sometimes I feel, 
and they were hanging there for us 
to see and then the Gestapo woul
d say, you are the next.  Just tort
uring, torturing us.  One time in 
the roll call order were young people and the olde
r people were sitting an
d the Ukrainian took -- 
her name  wa s Bosha, took her out and we thought ma ybe he was going to save her, but when she 

came back she said he raped me  and then he cam
e and shot her.  I had all her blood, you could 
everything from her brain.  He shot her right he
re in the head.  How can you have a very norma l 
life when you think of that.  One time I was selected
 to well asked to go and sort the clothing of 
the people who they still round up from different 
places.  That was the only time that I had done 
that.  That was the time that I found my mother's  
dress.  I found the pouch.  Of course there was 
nothing in it and I asked everybody if they 
came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at 
everybody who ma rched out to work.  So, I don't know
 if they found her where she was hiding or 
if she was there and I never saw her because when 
I talked to my cousin in Paris, she was like 15 
years younger than I, Mira said before I went to
 Auschwitz I was in Limb erg and never saw her.  
It was a big camp.  At that time  there was a Gest
apo ma n who we know that he is sadist.  He was 
choking people, especially young girls.  One time he
 selected me  to work in his house to clean 
his house.  His house was like a stone away from 
the door that rifles and Gestapo and everyone 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
14 
 
was watching when the people are going out, but
 the wome n were not going out anymore.  So, 
one time, around that time , we were selected to he
lp the me n dig trenches, and they said, this is 
not deep enough.  The men were like skeletons, 
no food nothing.  Then once again, right, left, 
right left.  Then they put the me n fac i ng the 
trenches and then the music played, famo us 
_____________ and the __________.  That's how they burie
d the people or tortured them and 
the squadron shot the people, some times not e
nough to kill them and then they order to bury 
them.  And you can hear the voices, help me  help me
 and they were just buried alive.  That time, 
I ma de up my mi nd if they shoot me  that's oka
y.  I spoke to the young ma n that you used to go 
with wome n and me n out to the factory to work. 
 His name  was Jacob.  
I said, you're comi ng to 
that house where I work for that Gestapo.  He never 
talked to me , he just 
said pointing that's not 
clean enough, but he never did anything to me .  He
 never gave me  food neither.  But, this Jacob 
used to come and bring some cans of milk, whic
h we didn't have it.  I said do you think you can 
dream up a pair of pants.  I would like to escape.  
I have a nephew.  I have to take care of him.  I 
promised my sister.  He said gosh I don't know how 
I can do it.  I said you bring that in a basket.  
Everybody is taller than you Ava.  I said I will 
round it up, don't worry.  If they shoot me , they 
shoot me .  I have nothing to lose.  And one day he 
did it.  He said 5:00 you have to drop into that 
row of people and just walk.  Of course I did 
not look very mu ch like a ma n, and ma ybe my walk 

was funny, but we were almost to get into the tr
olley when they start, "halt, halt" and they 
recognize.  I jumped into the trolley and the 
conductor refused to stop.  He  saw that I was 
escaping and he went.  Later on I 
have learned that he was shotbecause he come  mi nus one, that 
Jacob.  He was shot.  It was also hard for me  to
 live with that he some how did it for me  and he 
was not able to survive.  That time they went 
to that factory where I sometimes went to the 
baseme nt where the wome n work before, re
me mber I befriended myself with that 
superintendent.  I went in that ba
seme nt all alone.  I heard the voices
.  I bet they were rats.  I was 
so scared, but my head was shaved.  I couldn't 
go out, and I stayed there until they left  that  
building, which was around 4:00 and I knew there 
was a telephone in some room.  I quickly 

wanted to call Sishka and I said I escaped.  Sh
e said My God, am I going to take you.  You're 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
15 
 
going to have to wait.  I don't want to tell my 
mother.  Maybe Stashu, herbrother, will some how 
pick you up and bring some  clothing.  Then I heard 
steps, and my heart stopped and that was the 
superintendent.  He said what 
are you doing?   I said I escaped, can you help me  and he said my 
wife is not going to do that.  Let me  talk to her. 
 He talked to her and sh
e said here is soup.  Eat 
the soup and go.  Where would I go?   Go back to the cellar.  Let me  just use your phone and I 

can tell her where I am.  She did that, gave me  a 
scarf so I can cover my head and then some ti me  
it was very, very dark that they came  and I jumped 
into there.  They couldn't  take me  t o their 
home.  They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food.  I think I stayed there for 

almost three and a half weeks, 
until my hair grew to some thi
ng like you have, so I can go out.  
Some time very late at night they would let 
me  take a shower and that was a blessing.

Q. Before we go on, I want 
to go back a little bit. 
A. Allright. 

Q. When you saw those people committing suicide,
 jumping out of -- did you ever think to 
yourself that you wanted to commit suicide? 

A. Not then.  Not then.  Suicide no.  I just 
didn't care.  When my mother and Gaynosh were 
taken there was a time when I didn't care.  Only
 when I found mother's clothing and I knew that 
she was no longer alive, then I had 
that great desire to fulfill my 
promise to my sister.  Because 
when they took her to Auschwitz and I threw that
 bread if she caught it or not I will never know, 
and shear mi racle that that Ukrainian or German
 let go of my arm and didn't pull me t ogether 
through that ma rching group, I felt, I have to fulfi
ll my promise to her.  Suicide no, I'm just not 
geared to it. 

Q. Were you afraid of being raped? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
16 
 
A. Yes, that I wa s.  And by a very great mi r acle, even later on when I was in Vienna, where 
I will tell you from the point when I enlisted remi
nd me to tell you about a very close call to rape 
and I will touch on that.  I'm trying to do it se
quence as possible.  Have you have any other 
questions? 

Q. Yes.  When you were escaping -- 

A. From the concentration camp?  

Q. From the concentration camp, but I want 
to ask you both about th
e escaping about taking 
your mother out, about taking Gaynos
h out.  It seems very brave to
 think about goi
ng outside and 
taking the chance? 

A. It was not so brave.  There was really gut
s and the will to do that.  I was bringing really 
income  to the fa mily by going everyday out to
 the brewery, taking my
 armband.  Good, I was 
blonde and blue eyes as they sa
y, but nevertheless it was going 
out, facing -- it was like two 
different cities.  Ghetto was all Jewish the ot
her side was not.  That was taking a chance.  

Walking through the streets and 
seeing them ma r c hing and looking 
at you and pretend that you 
are just  hah-hah and you just smiling good day.  That was brave.  But then when they took my 

mother out, I didn't do it by myself because there 
I have the he lp once again of the Jewish boys 
who also took mother out to Gestapo headquarter
s and then she was going out to our area where 
we lived.  That was brave because where my fa
ther lived, we were known there.  Where my 
grandfather lived, we were known there.  She wa
s there I don't  know how 
long, but it must have 
been at least to that year that
 I found it unless they ke
pt the clothing that l
ong, but that was in the 
beginning of 1943. 

Q. How did you go out everyday, through the gate? 

A. No, through the other street
 that was just a hole and 
I was just making my way out 
because there was no wire in the Ghetto.  There were just streets.  If you knew the area you could 

just try to get out, and that's  
how I went almost every day. 
Q. Were you afraid? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
17 
 
A. Yes, yes.  Because I wanted to go b
ack.  As _________ said, my cousin from England, 
my mother always said Ava is so brave.  That wa s under good circumstances.  Until today, I am 
the do gooder, always for other people.  I do it toda
y, too.  I think that's my nature, but then my 
mother was a widow.  We didn't have money, a
nd she was working, and she was very active in 
an orphanage house.  Her name  was on the orphana
ge house, so every time when she was saying 

to us, to both of us, if you f
eel that you are depr ived, just lo
ok at the children who are much 
worse off, a nd then you see how lucky you are.  The
n, I said, well, how lucky we are.  But then I 
did the same  thing with my children when they 
didn't eat, I would just say, see you don't finish, 
people in Europe would give a
nything for crumbs , and Mitchell 
was always joking and he said, 
mother, pack the crumbs and send them.  But both 
of them grew up to be very charitable.  I 
reme mber we were in New York and walking through the streets there was a ma n without feet 

and a beggar and Mitchell said can I have my 
adva nce 25 cent allowance.  I'll pay you back, and 
then he went and gave to the ma n.  You live by 
example.  You live by example, and therefore I 
feel that the children, whether it 
be Ge rman or Polish or Lithuanian, they don't grow up with 
prejudices.  They'r e taught.  They'r e taught, ther
efore, I feel that re
ally the United States 
Holocaust in Wa shington or any 
other museums are me morials that
 were erected in the me mory 

of this six million will some how educate the pe
ople and let them know what hatred and bigotry 
can do.  Not only to a group of Jewish people, but 
it could be an individua
l what they have done 
to the homosexuals or  lesbians or to any othe
r group.  One day they ma y turn because they are 
catholics, but I think I always think that Hitler 
couldn't do those atrocities 
by himself.  He got the 
ma sses to follow him.  That is the tragedy.  Ho
w blindly people follow.  One, it be crazy or 
irrational and do what is absolutely against any prin
ciple to being a human being.  This is what is 
hard to understand for me.  Do you have any other 
questions.  Maybe I didn't
 make my self clear. 
Q. I'm interest to hear a little bit ag
ain about your escape from ____________ camp on t he 
trolley.  I don't quite und
erstand how you got away. 
A. Well, when you asked me before did I care or
 was I scared or did I have any reason or 
would I like to live.  That was the time that I fe
lt that I would like to fu
lfill my promise to my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
18 
 
sister Ruzia.  I had a desire to escape, and in th
at time , no, I wasn't  scared.  If they would have 
shot me  in my own hea r t I know I pl aced Gaynosh and I placed my mother.  I didn't know what 
their fate was going to be at th
e end, but at that time  I felt go
od.  When I was working for that 
Gestapo who was that sadist clean
ing his house, and then I had to
 go to the barracks.  I didn't 
stay, but I came  there almost at 4:00 to his 
house.  4:00 in the morning, without any food, and 

when I spoke to that Jacob and I told him just dr
op me  off some  pants.  I cannot go in a dress or 
skirt because  there was just that outfit.  When he
 brought that, he said you will have to fall in at 

5:00 and ma rch with the me n, but you are so short 
they'r e going to spot you.  I said don't worry, 
if they shoot me , they shoot me .  Don't worry.  Ju
st give me  a chance.  There was a big gate, and 
there were dogs and people with rifles to
 shoot when they didn't like some body.  M a ybe 
some body l ooked very fragile and they didn't let th
em go.  They just pulled them out and shot 
them right there.  This we saw too.  Then every
body tried to stand up strai
ght so they still with 
their last breath of their strength could go out.  
I ma rched in and tried being short to get closer 
and closer to the first, second row and then just ou
tside the gate was the tro
lley that took them to 
the factory.  Then, when I starte
d to walk faster and faster, so
me one of them spotted me , and 
they started to "halt, halt, 
stop, stop, stop."  Nobody stopped.  Th
ey were ma rching and I quickly 
run into the trolley and said to
 the conductor.  I'm escaping and 
I'm not even Jewish, I'm Polish 
and I'm trying to escape because they took me  by 
mi stake, because I didn't  know what the Polish 
person was thinking of the whole stor
y neither.  So, I said they shaved my head and I have to go 
and find my fa mily.  Wh en they came almost very 
close to the trolley all the men were there and 
he took off and they were shooting and he 
said, I don't stop, I go.  He said in Polish 

______________, we go.  But unfortunately later on I know
 that they shot that Jewish younger 
man, that Jacob because first of all they know th
at a woma n was in his group, and also that he 
came mi nus one.  So, I lived for a while with that
 guilt too, and when you start to think about it, 
which I don't want to think about it, you have a ve
ry guilty feeling.  Even now that we were in 
the beginning, well, it still didn't come to the ma rr
iage, so I'll tell you that 
later.  If you have any 
questions going back, I'll continue. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
19 
 
Q. Go ahead continue on when you were hiding. 
A. All right.  I was there in 
that shacks, two shacks, like I ha
ve one now in my own house.  
They brought some  food when it was very dark, because they still don't know -- there was a 

cluster of homes of the directors, the higher ups 
lived on that area.  Highe
r ups like the directors 
of the brewery and things like that.  They didn'
t know what is going to happen.  But when I came  
there, my fe eling was I'm going to see Gaynosh, and I said where is _____________.  Oh, they 

didn't want to stay here because they were
 afraid of the Germans and they went to 
Czechoslovakia, and they took Gaynosh with him.
  Gaynosh is Gershin name d after my father 
like my son Gary is always name d aft e r my father. 
 Then she told me  that after the war I can find 
her, which I will tell you what I did after the war.  
I stayed there I think to 
my best recollection of 
three and a half weeks, to gain a little 
hair and then one day ______________ came  and said you 
know what, I spoke to Wanda she's  in ___________ 
and she and Peter are working in the 
underground.  They are helping lots of Jewish
 people and also bombi
ng the bridges so the 
Germans cannot go from one side to another. 
 They said that you should ma ke your way to 
__________because lots of people registered as Polish to
 go to Germany or Austria.  Of course, I 
wanted to go to Vienna because I knew so ma ny 
people.  In that time , I just once again, took a 
chance and went to __________ by train.  Some body c
ould recognize me .  That's  that fa mous 
blouse that you have the pictur
e that ______________ gave me , and one sk
irt and that is all that I 
had.  I registered.  I had to wear an armband that 
said P "Polish."  They asked me  if I would go to 
Berlin first, and I said no, can I go to Vienna, 
Austria, preferably Vienna.  Of course you could 
speak like a Polish.  You could not speak likea Jew.  The Germans said do you speak German 

and I said yes.  I went to work in Vie
nna.  _____________ is -- have you ever been in Vienna 
Joan?   You know where the _____________, just on th
at street, which you come  out  and you 
cross the _____________, which is just like Fifth Av
enue in New York.  Then you have that 
_____________.  This is where ________________.  There was a Nazi.  What was his first 

name ?   Adolph, Adolph Shiltz.  Ma ybe he still exis
ts, and the Gestapo and the SS, Storm Fuhrer 
could not bear to have shirts with machine ma
de button holes.  They had to be hand made.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
20 
 
That's  what we did.  We  found by mi dway there was fi
ve of us who registered
 in different areas.  
But some how we fi nd ourselves working for that
 Mr. Shiltz.  My name is --- I'm still in 
_______________.  I lived longer -- excuse me , 
I retract, I was in ________________ living 
with my girlfriend Wanda and Peter and they as
ked me if I would like to work with them 
underground.  I said I cannot take 
the chances.  I wanted to see Ru
zia's son and I would rather go 
on and work.  So, my hair grew like that and I 
had nice hair.  You have 
a picture of that, and 
that's how I register.  I always had a nice smile.  
My mother said, the only nice pretty things that 

I have was my teeth and my eyes and they did not
 even want to put a filling in my teeth.  There 
was a Polish girl in Vienna.  They just pulled 
the teeth, which I lost th
ree on that side, two on 
that si de.  It was a little be tter treatme nt.  They 
didn't  kill you, but it was not easy to live and to 
be some body else. 

Q. What was your name? 

A. Ava Stephanie Rutkofska.  And Peter gave me  those papers, but my birthday was the 

same.  When I left, I have a picture with Pete
r and myself.  I will ma ke a copy and send you that 
because he really he lped me  out.  I don't know wh
ere he is now.  I start to write but nothing.  
Then, I came to that Mr. Shiltz and also they wa
shed the laundry there for those Gestapo.  So, 

there were baskets that we had to cross 
the ______________ and go to that We inberger and I 
was so ashame d to just carry that dirty laundry th
ere.  There was a Yugosla
vian.  He was always 
in civilian clothes.  I really 
don't know what he was, but he wa
s influential, and knowing that I 
was Ava, he always called me  Avasha, and he al
ways said how pretty I am.  He said, it seems 
like I see that you are ashamed.  Let me take one si
de of the basket and carry it with you.  He 
was very instrume ntal later.  This is what it 
was.  So, we had like ir
on  ______ a very me diocre 
pillow one thin blanket and one was scared of the 
other.  All girls, are you going to church, are 
you going to say novena.  Are you going to the eveni
ng services, and yes, of course.  And one 

was watching the other how we are crossing ourselves 
only to find out that all of us were Jewish.  
It wasn't  easy.  We  all had a shelf were we 
had our underwear and the blouse, the one blouse I 
washed every day and ironed.  And working for th
at Adolph Schiltz, he always tried -- he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
21 
 
some how took to me , his wife too and those tw
o children and the little one.  He said _________ 
come  in here and I said yes.  Do you know 
what the word __________ is.  You never heard of 
that.  Then there were other Jewish expressions 
and I said how would I know that.  Well, aren't  
you close to the Jewish people.  I said, well th
ey could be my neighbors but they did not know 
the language.  Then that ma n that I worked for 
that sadist one day he came in 1944.  He came  in 
Shiltz, Heil Hitler and of course 
he wa s such a Nazi and I don't know how I possibl y put my head 
so deep down that he doesn't see me .  Maybe he
 would not even recognize me .  I had hair and 
looked different, but I thought my he art st opped.  
He was talking about us, Shiltz, with him, 
because they were looking at our side .  I couldn'
t say anythi ng to the gi rls because I didn't know 
they were Jewish.  So, they say, is some thi
ng wrong.  I said no I just see that ______________ is 
here.  I wonder what he wants.  Maybe he is l
ooking for Polish girls because Mr. Shiltz talks to 
him.  If I get nervous I talk.  As you know, I to
ld you that, and finally he was going like toward 
us, but there was a little T.V. and that was the 
time that the Germans had lots of trouble in 
Russia.  As a ma tter of fact, one of the Jewish
 girls, the only one I don't know her name , she was 
from Lodz of course in the Irish papers she wa
s Marisha, but what I unde
rstand her brother was a 
fa mous Jewish historian.  I don't know he
r name  and she was singing or reciting the 
______________ you know, backwards.  March, ma rch forwa r d and then backwards.  Maybe 

she expressed herself that way before really it 
was peace, and they took her and she vanished the 
last days of the war.  However, they looked on 
the T.V. and I did not kno
w there was a little T.V. 
on the shelf and that's where he st opped so th
ey didn't reach us.  It's another mi racle. 
Q. You mean they had a survei
llance came ra of some kind? 
A. Just a T.V., but he didn't want us to k
now that the Germans were having problems in 
Russia and they'r e trying to withdraw.  Re me mbe r
 the time that they were
 having problems .  You 
know, we have like rations, it's what they'r e know
n here as stamps, but we could by some  food 
for it.  One time  I went to restaurant which 
was a cafe house and I had my P, my ar mband, and I 
always was aware of it that people ma y recognize me
 because I used to live in Vienna .  There 
was a woma n, I can see her like today, a black hat 
a black turtle neck.  She was just like you bury

people.  All in black.  And she was looking at me
 and looking.  I couldn't swallow.  I had a cup 
of soup, and I couldn't hardly swallow.  She ju
st have noticed my uneasiness and finally she 
came over and she said, hello.  She said, are you 
hiding.  I said no, I'm working here, a Polish 
girl.  Where are you working?   I say in a Ge
rman place.  She said, you can tell me , are you 
Jewish?   I said no, and she said you can be honest 
with me .  I would like to help you.  I watched 
you.  I must have been in the re
staurant before.  You always have the same outfit.  Can I buy 
some thing for you, and I said, that's the end.  She 
must be from the German Gestapo.  I said, I 
don't accept anything from people.  She said, what's
 your first name ?   I said Ava.  Ava, ah, 
__________, I said Ava, I'm Polish, and she said, conf
ide in me because I 
will confide in you.  I 
am Jewish.  My husband was not.  That's why we
 don't live together, not to bring harm to him, 
but I have a son I wish you could me et him.  His name  is Eric.  I said I cannot date anybody 
because that's against the rules.  We ll, where ar
e you working.  I said not ar away from here and 
she just extracted from me  and I said ________________, 
and she said I give you the address.  I 
don't have a telephone.  You can call me .  I said
 I don't have a telephone where we live.  One 

time, at work, a German there always were
 Germans, SS or Gestapo comi ng came a very 
handsome tall young fellow, once again Heil Hitler a
nd they start to look once again our way.  I 
said, uh-huh, that's the wo ma n who denounced me and Shiltz said, "Come  in here. 

________________ wants to meet me."   I said I don'
t know anybody.  So, he said, I am Eric.  
You know that smile on his face, oh his teeth and 
I said I don't know you do I?   He said, I think 

you would know me  if we talked together.  He di
dn't  want to speak in front of Shiltz.  That 
ma kes me  a little easier and I said 
how do you want to talk to me ?   
Mr. Shiltz said use my office.  
I thought they'r e wired and they'r e just going to just
 -- so he pried again a
nd he said my mother 
saw you and she really almost fell in love with 
you.  She ma de me  come  a nd meet you.  I said, 
for what reason.  Because I can help you.  You 
see, I'm half J e wish, but I cannot tell them 
because I am with the ___________ and I said we ll I'
m Polish so that doesn't go together, and I 
have a Polish boyfriend, and he said, well, he 
cannot help you, but I ca
n.  I said, well, ma ybe 
some ti me  in the future.  He come  once again, an
d I was in the hands of Mr. Shiltz who said you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
23 
 
ought to go out with him.  He never tried to do an
ything to me .  He just said can my mother -- 
not he, can my mother buy you -- you will ma ke he
r so happy.  I said no I don't need anything.  
So, one day he came and he told Mr . Shiltz.  He di dn't ask me , but he asked Mr. Shiltz if he 
could take me overnight to --  he named her 
name, I reme mber only her name was Elli and she 
was in the ______________.  I don't reme mber the stre
et.  She owned a shoe store and a most 
beautiful apartment and a very known husband of a ____________, and she was a Nazi.  He 

asked Shiltz that he would like to take me  for a 
date there to a party.  Then I found out that she 
took over the Jewish families, the store, the sh
oe store and all his ap
artment with beautiful 
things, with paintings that ma ybe you see in Louv
re, and a big bust of Adolph Hitler.  Then came  
some  other young soldiers that they came fromPoland, SS me n to the party, and Er ic was there 

too.  This young ma n who was ma
ybe half drunk he was telling 
the group some thing that would 

amuse them.  I just came from near Limberg where 
we tied each child to a branch of the tree and 
put it aflame .  And he said, why don't  you laugh. 
 I don't know.  I don't find it funny.  They are 
huma n beings.  But they were Jewish.  I said, oh, 
not to get myself into 
trouble, and Eric looked 
at me and he said, well I have some plan
s to take __________ to show
 her a little bit around 
because she can not really go as a Polish girl.  
He must have seen some thing on my face, and I 
don't know i f Ellie knew some thing or not, but she always felt that I'm her ___________.  She 

took to me.  One time she came to Shiltz, Heil H
itler, she wants to take me  to the Gestapo.  
Re me mber ma rching up those big headquarters, all 
those steps up with all those swastikas and I 
went there and she said could you say Heil Hitler 
and I said Ellie don't ask me  to do that.  I'm 

Polish.  And she said, "I'll protect you." 
 And she introduced me  my ______________.  But she 
didn't use Rutkofska.  My _______________, so I didn't have to add that.  Then when it was very 

bad and the Germans we re really retreating and ther
e was lots of being in 
the baseme nt, shooting, 
and the Russians came in from the other side, she had to go to ___________ to run away, and 

she said __________ the only thing, stay in my apartm
ent but be sure that you take care of the 
bust of Adolph Hitler.  Well, that
 wa s the first thing that went through the window.  Then I took 
all the people that I know, Polish, 
Jewish and asked them to come  to the shoe store and take as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
24 
 
ma ny shoes as they can, and that was my revenge.  
At least to her.  I ne
ver saw Eric or anyone.  
But you spoke about the rape, but when the Russia
ns came into that part, which later on they 
retreat on the other side of th
e Danube, I was living with a family, a German fa mily who were 
Ellie's friends.  He was a piano player, blind, ve
ry nice family, and his wife was Maria.  They 
took me , so when the officer of the Russians came
, they caught me  in that building and asked to 
bring it down.  This person laying down on the tabl
e and he said, "I'm goi ng to have intercourse 
with you."  And some body went qui
ckly upstairs to I think his na
me  was Paul, that blind ma n I 
lived with.  I don't re me mber the last name , and 
he came blind with a stick and he said, let my 
sister go.  That's how close I was to it.  Just beca
use he was blind, I think, 
that that's what really 
took that person back. 
Q. This was a Russian soldier? 

A. A Russian officer.  Then I understand that 
ma ny people in that building worried, and then 
we heard that the American soldiers came  on that
 side and I came  down 
wa lked on the street and 
there was an American soldier and I didn't speak E
nglish an I said American and he said yes.  
Na me ?   And he said Orbanik.  I said are you Polish?
  He said, yes, no speak it.  Never even tried 
to find him, but then I don't know wit h that
 United Jewish restitution who came with the 
packages and everything like fo
r the Jewish people or was 
it that ___________ what was that?  
Joint Distribution, that's what it was.  So, I cam
e.  I didn't have any food, nothing too much, and I 
said, I'm Je wish and I would like 
to register and they said, but 
you don't look Jewish.  I said, are 
we going to do in reverse now. 
 Hitler thought I do, and you say I don't.  He said, well, 
everybody would like to be Jewish to 
be a package.  I said, that is unbelievable.  Then there was 
near the river and there was not far aw
ay from the _______________, I was walking along and 
that person that they showed you, the pict
ure ____________ she was mu ch older than I.  I 
reme mber only she was comi ng to a mutual rela
tive, and she was walking with a ma n and didn't 
pay attention.  I only heard her saying Oh, that gi
rl looks like Sabina's  
daughter.  My mother's 
name  was Sabine.  We  turned around and she sa
id, oh, ma ybe that is.  So, I said, who are you.  
She said are you Ava or Ruzia?   I said, that's
 my sister Ruzia, I'm Ava.  She said I'm 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
25 
 
___________ and I had to recall when I me t her she had always that beautiful hair growing all 
round.  She was the first one to tell me  where my
 mother was hiding.  She came across in another 
hiding place with my mom, but then she was very  good financially off so she was able to go to a 

safer place and she never saw my
 mo ther again.  So, she said, I hope you're getting food and I 
told her what happened.  So, she said, ____________, it 
must be like some  name, let me go with 
you to the joint distribution and let me  be a witne
ss and I have that paper if you want to say Anna 
___________ and I forgot his first name .  They ma rried
 eventually.  He was in film industry and 
they ma de a statement that I didn't know how to write
 -- read Jewish.  They asked me  to read that 
I am Jewish and I got a package with eggs and milk, and I broke out because I didn't have 

anything for so ma ny ye ars and to this day I cann
ot have eggs because I 
break out.  I just can 
have egg beater when they came out.  That's how 
it was that history.  So after I didn't have to  
work anymore in Shiltz office, I start to en
list with __________ to some how finish my education 
in the business admi nistration and 
I me t a Valerie.  Her father  wa
s a veterinarian and we ma de 
very good friends, and that was still before they
 recognized me  that I'm Jewish, because that 
happened in 1944, almos t  the war was over.  
No, no, no, that happened in 1946, after the war 
was already over.  She invited me  to her home to 
introduce me to her parents.  They were very 
nice to me .  They asked me  to live with them. 
 Then, in one Sunday dinner came Victor who was 

a dentist and he started to just ask me  out.  Polis
h, that's  what they talked.  They were very happy 

that we'r e going.  They liked me , but they
 said that they were ____________.  You know, when 
you lived in Prussia which was one time  occupied 
by Germans .  So, they had to go into Ar my, to 
the military of Ger many, but you were no the SS we
re you?   He said no.  I fought not to go, but I 
had to serve.  His father said, 
yes, we had to.  I just bought it 
some how.  One time we went to the 
beach and on his arm was SS and I sa id to hi s pa
rents that they like hi m very much, but I cannot 

go.  That would be sacrilegious against my whole  fa
mily.  He cried, he said I didn't want to this 
way and that way, and her mother gave me  a platinum chain, which I still have because  I liked it.  

Then there was a Jewish doctor who is now in Ch
icago, Dr. Heller and his wi
fe Ruthie and I told 
them that, and he said Ava, denounce them.  I be
t the whole practice is overthrown Jews.  He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
26 
 
was a Viennese.  I start not to see him, but after 
when I start to inquire, my mother had a cousin 
that I know that he sent her some time s five or
 ten dollars because my 
father and my mo ther 
helped him when he was a young man to come  into
 a big city from a s mall little _______.  I am 
still in touch with his daughter Sadelle, in New 
York.  She's ma rried to a banker.  He tried to 
work with the restitution 
during this period.  The papers started to be processed for me  t o come  
here.  At that time I denounced Victor, that he's
 an SS and his practice should be taken away, and 
I liked him, but I felt I had to do it.  I did it. 
 He tried to find me , because he knew me  as a 
Rutkofska.  I saw him one time when I was with my husband, the only time  in Vienna he was 
working and he turned around and I turned around 
but that's all what it was it.  Never called, 
nothing.  It was hard to live be
ing some body else.  It's not easy and especially when I was not 
recognized.  I had to go on for the longest time  
to pretend, otherwise I was no one.  But then, I 

decided to go to Czechoslovakia.  I had to 
find Gaynosh.  That was the whole purpose.  So, I 
ma ke myself wait to go to Czechoslo
vakia but I was _______________.  I didn't belong 
anywhere. 

Q. What year was this? 

A. That was after the war '4 5, must be '4 6 before I even knew that ________________ was 

going to st op me .  I went because  there was a purpose, and they arrest me .  One time, once again, 

that Yugoslavian, or was he Czechoslovakian, he 
took me  from one barrack to the ot he r and he 
spotted me  just like he helped me  with that basket and he said ______________.  He must have 

had pull, I still don't know what he did, and he said
 to them in the their language, which I didn't 
speak, that he knows me .  Some how t hey free me . 
 I Never was able to 
find Sishka or Gaynosh 
because he said I want you to leave right now 
because they may arrest you and I cannot get you 
out.  So, there was absolutely no way.  Then I star
ted to get in contact wi
th the Red Cr oss.  All 
the means that you can possibly think.  When my hus
band, before he died went with me  to Israel, 
I even went to ____________ ma de all the necessary information perhaps ma ybe they took the 

children to Israel, but to no ava
il, nothing.  So, the ni
cest thing, Joan, what 
happened to me  was I 
thought I would not turn to Judaism.  That was 
my first thought.  I thought if I ever have a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
27 
 
fa mily, I would not like them to go through what 
I went through just be
cause you were Jewish.  
There was no other reason.  As a ma tter fact, I we
nt to Parochial schools.   And I have in my 
fa mily people who are today prac
ticing Christianity, but then 
I knew a friend from Pol a nd, and 
she was ma r r ied to a doctor at the same  hosp
ital where my future husband now was working, 
which was the ________________ University Hospital 
in New York City, where my husband 
was at that time, the last year 
resident already in the specialty 
of Radiology.  They invite me  to 
play tennis with them.  I never possessed my own 
racket because my mot her couldn't afford.  My 
cousin _______ was very well to do and she was tall
 6 feet and from her clothing sometimes they 
ma de some  dress for me , but we were always ve
ry close even though that she is closer to my 
sister's age, because I always told her the tric
ks when we came to visit her, as children.  Her 
mother had governesses for her because nobody 
should blow on them and I always went 
_______.  I was like Mitchell right now.  Then, the 
fa mily was not well to do but a very fine 
fa mily of Milton Dorfma n, and when I worked on Wall Street in the bank, at that time I 
interpreted German and Polish.  I knew a little bi
t Russian, and the other 
girls were Polish and I 
at one time  when Magda said why don't you come  and her husband was _______________.  Her 

son is one of the very known ___________ and he's  
in music that music that you and I possibly 
don't understand.  However, he is also a radiologist 
in Sausolito California, and his father was the 
governor of Maine and he  was a very good friend of Milt, and we played tennis and I sa id, oh 

he's so slow.  He's not going to play good tennis.
  Well, he played tennis.  I was jumping, but he 
played tennis.  Then, what attracted me  was that
 so ma ny other people want
ed to take me  out to 
Waldorf Austoria or some thing a
nd I was wondering what they would 
like to have in return for 
it, but Milt said we can have a hamburger or a 
hot dog and he always went like that because he 
was wearing a jacket from Maury, from his older br
other.  I just thought that's nice.  Then I me t 
him in 1948, very vaguely.  That's what I 
wanted to tell you.  Ou
t of 35,000 people I was 
selected to be on a caravan of hope to bring my s t
ory and also there were two Israeli officers.  I 
think I sent you a clipping, Joan, of it.  At that 
time I spoke of it worse than I speak now.  I had 
developed laryngitis and in our ca
ravan of hope, we stopped in Utica, which is really near where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
28 
 
I live since 1954 when I came with my husband at th
at time .  The people were very nice.  They 
tried to ____________.  I never knew what that is, but 
they were very friendly and I spot that.  
That was in 1948, me mo ries it was 
very hard to reme mber everything, and I even forgot that I 
was in Springfield.  Whe n I sent you the clippi
ngs I said I was looking for some  papers, and by 
coincident I had the clippings fr
om Springfield Massachusetts.  Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture 
in that article, I cannot recall th
at I was in Springfield Massachus
etts.  No way.  I reme mber I 
was in Syracuse University because  over there they
 once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I 
always thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Ga
rdner will speak to us.  Of course I don't know 
who is Ava Gardner.  I didn't see any movies, and 
I waited and they started 
to laugh.  It's  me .  So, 
right now, before I came here.  I tried to cont
ac t the Utica Observer Dispat ch, which is a 
newspaper, and they told me  that if it's  '48 or
 '49 it would beon mi crof
ilm in the public libra ry, 
which I got the clipping that I showed you.  Then
 I called the library a
nd the University of 
Syracuse, and they send me  a clipping which I show
ed you.  They were one of the soldiers of the 
officers was the nephew of the President to
 the Israeli state of _______________, and the other 
one lost both legs because I think that was the 
time  that Israel gained
 independence in 1948 or 
'49.  So, at that time  I went on the caravan of 
Hope and the ot her pl ace that stayed out in my 
mi nd.  I had always that same  blouse that you have  the picture.  I did not acquire anything else, 
and we went to Atlanta.  I don't reme mber Atla
nta but I reme mber the hotel that we stayed.  
There was also a big philanthropist from 
Rochester ______________, who when we got ma rried, 
put carpet in our house because he reme mber me fr
om the Caravan of Hope.  He still lives in 
Rochester.  He's a great contributor
 to Israel .  At that time I aske
d the elevator gi rl because that 
was the only category I could afford to have ma ybe 
what she wears.  If af
ter work she can take 
me  and I can get another blouse because I still have
 to go further.  She said I can't  go with you.  I 
said is it be cause I'm Jewish.  I said why.  She 
said, because I cannot ride in the same  bus that 
you are.  I said why not?   She said, because I'm bl
ack.  At that time  I think, I'd like to go back, 

because there couldn't be anything worse at the 
time  to go from one oppression and find that I 
came to a country that is free and have that.  Who'
s next I said to myself.  That ma de a very big 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
29 
 
impression on me  and that's how I know I was in A
tlanta.  But nothing of that sort happened in 
Springfield Massachusetts. 
Q. What was the Caravan of Hope? 

A. Caravan of Hope was primary to bring to 
the attention what happened with the Jewish 
people and speaking about my ________________, my experi
ences and for the Israeli soldiers or 
officers to raise money for the UGA because a por
tion would be to save 
the children who came  
fr om Holocaust or other displaced families, and 
to raise money on all the st ops.  Then after I 
came from Caravan of Hope, my hu
sband at that time was just c
ourting me , asked me if we can 
see each ot he r again.  He's a very fine person, neve
r never speaking about himself.  That's when I 

me t his doctor McKenzie and he was just in the la
st year of radiology, a re
sident, a doctor came  
in and he asked Doctor McKenzie
 to look over the pictures, the 
x-rays and he said whatever 
Doctor Dorfman will say, that is the diagnosis, 
which I hi ghly thought of.  He asked me to go to 

a dinner to his family.  I told him, he asked me
 if eventually we canma rry, and I said if your 
fa mily wouldn't like me, I wouldn't marry you, because 
I really need a family.  I meant it.  So, we 
went there.  It was a nice apartment.  The father
 worked at 70 years of ag
e because he was a self 
taught person to design dresses.  They called h
im back at that age because he was so good, and 
he always said to Mama , you wear this dress 
funny when I come  home.  It was a wonderful 

fa mily, but when I came  there once again, long hair
 I heard her brother, Uncle Abe saying, nice 
girl, too bad she isn't Jewish.  That followed me
 all the time.  So, I opened the door, and I said, 
but she is.  He was just so happy about it.
  Then in 1949, Christma s day, a Professor 
_____________, who still lives in New York City, who 
was the Chief of Radiology, lent us the 
car and we went to Atlantic City, which was so
 called.  Then he took 
a position in Des Moines 
Iowa and that's  where my both boys were bor
n in a Methodist Hospital, and we had the 
circumcision right there in the hospital because 
the fa mily was so far away that nobody came  for 
it.  Then, my husband really wanted to be closer 
to the family and at that time  -- I enjoyed Des 
Moines.  There was a beautiful synagogue, a Refo
rm, and there was evening sermons were very 
nice and educational.  They spoke about everyt hing and about the Holocaust, but then he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
30 
 
offered a position in New York City, which he didn'
t want to be in a big city not to raise the 
children there.  Then there was a position in 
Rome, New York.  We  didn't know that Rome  was 
horrible at that time .  I couldn't believe that I li
ved there.  Then my cousin came  from Paris she 
said this is a slow death.  Why are you living here
.  We don't  even have a movie.  We have to 
travel 20 miles to a movie.  But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the 

community then you grow closer.  My husbandwas chosen among 14 other radiologist one of 

them Jerry Segal, who is in Utica right now, and is
 glad that he didn't take it, because  there is 
very anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my 
husband neve r delved into what is going on, so 

when they proposed to him, he said fine I like 
to play golf but then when he found out that we 
would be the only ones, he felt very bad.  Later 
we learned that three voices were against only 
because he was Jewish and the vice presid
ent of the ________________, Charlie Getty, who is a 
very good friend of ours, said I will ha ve to resign.  Because if we can't  have a fine person like 

Milt, we should be lucky that he want s to join.  This is how I joined the ____________ Club, 

which I was the only one but at 
that time  Rabbi, who is now li
ving in Maryland, Rabbi We i mer 
said maybe there will be opening.  But they until 
today they think Milt is
 Jewish and I'm not.  
And Joan, I don't want to talk about it.  I feel
 that I'm still having problems with it because one 

time I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good.  When I was non-

Jewish that was no good, so when they asked me  I ju
st said I believe that 
I do things other human 
beings and that is the greatest 
religion what you can do, serve the 
fellow ma n.  So, lots of people 
think that I ma rried Milt that he's Jewish, I'm no
t Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way 
to correct it.  It's immaterial 
to me .  Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the Hebrew 
school, and Gary right now I have two sons.  One 
is Gary, one is Mitchell.  They are also two 
years apart.  Both born in May.  Gary is a prof
essor of Radiology where 
he is lecturing at the 
Medical School at Brown and is ch
ief of the departme nt and that's
 also recently pr esident of the 
Cardiovascul ar Society for the whole United Stat
es and spoke recently in Sweden.  But above 
everything, very good son.  Mitchell
 is in New York.  He's  with the New York State Mental 
Health and he is a psychologist.  He got hi
s ma sters and hopes one day to get his doctorate

degree.  However, once again tragedy struck an
d we have been ma rried 39 years and children 
start to ma ke preparation for our 40th wedding a
nniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary 
and his fami ly we pick them up at the Syracuse 
Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2 
or three years old and we went to our house.  We
 had a wonderful Saturday, that same  day.  I had 
some  people for dessert in the evening, and my hu
sband said, well it's late but we don't have to 
get up next morning, Sunday, so early.  He neve
r woke up.  I found hi m sitting in his chair gone.

Q. Ava you were talking about 
the loss of your husband and how
 important he was to you. 
A. Well, he was not only a husband, he was 
a true friend and I didn't speak about my 
experiences but only with Milt.  He was a very
 ki nd and understandi ng pe rson.  I know that the 
patient s former patients of his are still saying wh
en Doctor Dorfman was here they must have 
thrown away the mold, how the saying goes.  Ther
e isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at 
home  especially when you have radiology.  Y
ou go into that big machine you need some body.  
At night evidently I had very ba
d dreams and someti mes I'd say don't let them take me.  I had to 
explain to him what I me ant.  But  one time I 
think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just 
to graduate from high school, my husband was take
n to the hospital with 
a heart attack.  That 
was the only one.  He was on very mi nima l me di
cations and everything 
was wonderful.  As a 
ma tter of fac t , that fourth of July when the chil
dren came to visit us, Gary could not come  very 
often because he is so busy.  It was only because 
ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska 
where I was taking a group of Senior citizens, an
d he and Doctor Brown who is on  the picture 
with ________ with me  and his wife were supposed 
to go together.  Gary persuaded me  that I 
should take the trip in that short time because 
I didn't sit shiva.  There was only one night and 
they were laughing and ma king jokes, the ma n that
 supposed to get you out of --- I just  couldn't 

stand it.  I just said no.  Mitche
ll had to go back to work and Gary stayed with me  and then went 
on the bus with me  to Syracuse until he placed 
me  on that pl ane.  Of course I don't reme mber 
anything about Alaska.  I cried a
nd cried and Doctor Brown tried 
to give me some se dative and 
I'm anti-me diation so I just suffer without being ca
lmed down.  Every time they said you have to 
eat some thing and I didn't.  That's the time I lo
st 17 pounds which I neve
r regained.  It was a 
shock, just a shock because we were together 
and on Sunday just to find him just --- I took his 

head and I said, we call each other ba be, not 
Milt or Ava was not known and everybody called 
him -- my c ousin writes letters 
"how is baby? "   So, I said babe you can take and I stopped 
because he was cold, and the friend of ours who is
 the publisher of the paper he still sa ys he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
33 
 
reme mbers when I said "He's so cold, he's so co
ld."  I was in shock.  They didn't know if I'm 
going to get out, but they used to have a friendl
y poker game  every Friday in the Sentinel which 
is our newspaper.  When Milt di ed, they never 
resu me d it.  George Wa ters and Shirley said, 
George doesn't  face anyone without Milt.  He 
was very recognized professionally.  He was 
president of the whole Society, no
t only locally but for the New York State.  He was a very good  
____________, was a wonderful husband and friend, and a 
wonderful father.  When you read the 
clippings, which ma ybe I left you, he did volunt
eer radiology for the DDSO, which deals with 
the me ntal retardation and they 
provided a portrait of my hus ba
nd.  He looks exactly like the 
write up that Gary put for his obituary in the me dical
 journal.  It was a wh
ole dedication with lots 
of friends invited and the ma yor of our city, Carl Ilemberg said
 that he doesn't know in his 
history of serving everywhere he come s from 
Rochester that two people in the same fa mily 
would be honored because there was the dedicati
on and the whole radiology department and the 
DDSO is Doctor Milton Dorfman. 
 And of course, as you know, I think I mentioned one time to 
you Joan initially when we spoke
 like a year ago, that when 
I saw the mi streating in the 
concentration camp of the elderly 
in particular no me rcy, and I wa
s so close to my grandfather 
and grandmother, I said to God, whoever he wa s at that time , that when I survived the 

concentration camp I will do something for the el
derly and for the children, and I left you the 
write up.  You'll see that I single handedly 
I was able to try to
 get _____________ and through 
singly handed just raise 45,000 as
 a third of the whole payment 
for the land for the building, and 
then Governor Rockefeller was then the governor 
and they asked me  to speak about the aged.  I 
don't know i f you ever heard of Monsignor Faye.  He said for every President, Kennedy, Johnson 

and then Nixon as a me mber on the Committee on the Aging in Wa shington to the President.  I 

know Monsignor when he was Father Faye and when 
they called me  for the Catholic charities in 
Utica that Rockefeller was going to speak, coul
d I come  and speak on the aged because  I was 
sort of a pioneer in that area. 
 I said not with Monsignor Faye. 
 He's too knowledgeable and so I 
came and he met me in the White House.  I wa
s delegate to the White House conference on 
aging and I met hi m there.  As a matter of fact, 
when we had the 25th anniversary of the Senior 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
34 
 
Citizen's Council and the move me nt  in the r
oom I called the __________ Univ
ersity where he is 
the President of the third world, and I said I w
ould like to speak with Monsignor Faye, and he 
said who shall I say is calling, and I said he 
would not know me , but I would like to speak with 
me .  So, he came to the telephone and he never said
 Monsignor, he said Fa ther Faye and I said 
Monsignor you would not reme mber me  he said "H
ello Ava."  He said it there was 400 people 
__________ which is a bi g beautiful place and he said how can we forget Ava.  Then, just by the 
Senate and the Congress they proclaimed the whol
e day Ava Dorfman.  I told Sheri Bolet who is 
the Congressman you ha ve to give me  at 8:00 in th
e evening the day is almost over.  I hope -- the 

one thing I will say that God help
ed me to fulfill my promise, 
because I st arted just  calling a 
meeting of the retirees from the ma nuf
acturing from cable and I'll call and ______________ and 
it grew to 3,200 where I was 17 year
s the president and that was the time  when my c hildren were 
5 and 7.  I drug them everywhere and every senior
 citizen was their grandma and grandpa.  As a 
ma tter of fac t , when I came  one ti me  to New York and Mitchell was already after college before 

he got his ma sters, I said, Mari
e will be comi ng, Mother don't let her call me  Mitchey.  Surely 

enough she did.  But I didn't give up lots of times 
that they could have spent with the children, 
but I didn't play cards.  I didn't go anywhere in th
e evening.  I stayed at home .  When they were 
in school and before they come  to school we almo
st met because I tried to divide my time.  At 
the beginning my husband was the 
chief of the Radiology at Rome  Hospital and then opened his 
own practice, so he was very busy.  As a ma tte
r of fact, my husband was very understanding and 
any honors that were bestowed on me I always felt th
at he had to have a better part in it because 
not ma ny husbands would see that on Saturday
 and Sunday I cleaned the house and ironed 
because I didn't have the time to do it.  There were others, United Wa y, Polio, Mother's March 

and for the children I establishe d a speech therap
y where the children from parochial schools and 
public schools and the deaf school were comi
ng and raised the money to pay the speech 
therapist.  But it comes back to
 you.  One time my car was stolen
 and I had to call the Triple A 
and Mr. _____________ came and said Mrs. Dorfman we '
ll have to take that car to the shop and 
recharge the battery.  I said how will I get there.  
Oh, I'll get a ride.  I'll come  there.  It was more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
35 
 
than the Tr iple A pays and I aid how much I ow
e you.  He says nothing.  He shows me a picture, 
like a newspaper picture of a girl 
and he said you paid a lot.  I sa
id, how did I.  Jackie was in 
your speech therapy and she was stuttering and ha
ving a clef palate and you sent her to Ki m 
Janet in Hunter New York.  You have done wonders
 because she is now graduating from college.  
So, there is you don't ask for rewards but what
ever you do good to people it come s back and I 
feel if my children, and I see them living by that 
example, and when I sometimes used to say to 
Gary how come  you're getting so late for dinner.
  We ll, mot her it would ma ke you feel good.  I 
went to the ward where they are really forgotte
n elderly people and I ju
st thought I'd see what 
they are doing.  I was happy.  I was happy.  My husba
nd was also very active.  He wa s the first 
chairman, president of the _____________.  He tried tobe active, and most of all was very kind 
to the human race, and that is ve ry important.  
Hi s parent s, when they printed the invitation for 
our wedding, they said the wedding of our childre
n, the wedding of our children and my father -- 
which I called him papa, was very nice when 
the neighbors asked him 
how is your daughter-in-
law and he said I don't have daughter-in-law, I ha
ve a daughter.  So, but now that Milt is gone, 
I'm taking a candle and going to the Temple wh
e n I get the announcement that there is the 
___________ and I feel that they were close to me. 
 There is still one sister, Blanche.  Her 
husband was a doctor in New York City and he died
 of cancer.  I do come  together.  She came to 
the funeral.  And another son, another brother died
 so it's really Blanche only who is alive.  I 
don't know what to tell you else. 

Q. I have just a couple of questions from befo
re.  You me ntioned that there wa s a particular 

roll call at the Yunaski camp
 with this little child?  
A. Yes.  You see in the summer ti me  when 
they called us out again sitting on that hot 

summer day, they put buckets of water just for us to
 see but not to give us.  We  were so dry we 
couldn't get anything.  But they brought more 
people in from different areas and among them 
was a child who was just crawling and the child 
doesn't  know anything so she or he crawled to 
that bucket and put his hands in and that SS or 
Gestapo, they'r e all the same , had a whip with 
leather fringes, and he kicked the child -- no ki
cked the bucket and the water just was out and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
36 
 
said, now that you've had your fun, can have the 
child have some  water.
  He once again thought 
that that was very brave and Je
ws wouldn't do that.  Am I not Jewish and I said no, I'm not.  
However, they put the other bucket and the child cr
awled again and he kicked the child in such a 
way that we couldn't even look around because we  couldn't turn our heads.  Then he came  and 
struck me over my face and I had a big scar he
re.  Now, I had the surgery I never know but 
everything happened on that side.  
It was not the strap but what he
 did.  That is what I would 
always remember.  There were many other in
cidents too numerous to me ntion.  I me an the 
hanging of the people or putting dogs, vicious dogs 
and seeing the flesh taking of the people.  I 
don't know.  It was 20th century and the German 
people were supposed to be so civilized.  
Where is the civilization taking us. 

Q. One last st ory.  When you were waiting to
 come  to this country, you were waiting for a 
ship called the Lillymarlane? 

A. From _____________.  At that time 
there was a strike an they 
could not move the boat at 
that time from Brenehauffer and other friend who 
came together at that time, Anna Novak, her 
husband was an attorney and he passed away an
d she ma rried a Doctor Heller, not the same  
Heller, and he's with the Northwestern Medical 
School.  So is her son in the same  place, and 
Henry her husband then said -- no they came and 
told us we have to cl ean the toilets because 
that's where our buildings, our bunk beds because I 
reme mber that Anna and Henry were there, I 

was here.  They came and once again Germans clean the toilets and Henry went.  He was an 

attorney.  He went and cleaned for Anna too.  Isaid I wouldn't  do that, and the German looked at 

me  and said yes you would and I said No I won't.
  Henry pleaded with me  in Polish, you are so 
close to a new life, don't be stubborn,
 go clean.  I wouldn't.  I just 
wouldn't.  So, they took me  to 
an offi ce where there was other military person just 
with a shirt not with that straps and I told 

him that I had to succumb to anything they want
ed.  After the war I don't feel like I want to do 

that.  He said, he looked at me , he sat there a
nd looked at me  and he said but don't you want to 

go to America and start a new life.  I said yes, 
but that doesn't  mean that i have to clean the 
toilets.  He said I'm from Austria.  They were 
not very much better, but 
I told him that I lived 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
37 
 
there and he said, well, why don'
t you don that for me.  I said I wouldn't do that for you.  I 
wouldn't do it for me .  He said, well it seems like 
you are determined.  I will 
tell them that I have 
a different job for you.  I don't know what I did 
and Henry said she won once again.  Well, won 
or not won, it was degrading to me  after the war 
that they had to do once again that dirty job.  
But, as they said when I came here it was not 
so easy neither because the cousin of my mother 
had an aunt from his wife's side.  We never 
knew and he was on vacation when I came .  He came 
in July and he was with the children Sadell and 
Julius and he asked me  to be with that aunt.  
Very uneducated and she had a da
ughter Molly and Molly came in
 and asked me how the dress 
looks on her.  I was always ____________ and I said 
not so good.  They didn't know that in the 
United States you always say oh nice 
lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her.  At 
one point she said, _____________ hatred did not do that
 to the Jews in the United States so it 
must have been that God wanted it this way.  We
l l , that was the end.  I just took my things and 
found out that the Doctor Heller from Vienna and 
Rudy were in the United States, and then they 
asked me  come  and live with them.  From there when I started to work at Wa ll Street with the 

Polish bank I lived with a Jewish family.  That
's  what I want to tell you about, Ann Reml er, 
Zigmund's sister.  I lived on Ocean Avenue and 
I wore, -- I don't reme mber her husband's name 
but she was Sophie and they were very nice.  
They had two boys and friends came and played.  
At that time I made a promise to my s i ster's fa
ther --in-law.  He had a daughter who studied 
me dicine in Vienna and I only know that she ma rri
ed an American me dical student.  I know that 
she was Anna Silver, but I didn't know who she ma rried.  So when I was -- that was before I 

ma rried my husband, but we were seeing each other.
  I went to the New York Time s and spoke 
to a then reporter who wa s very known, Charlie
 Grutzner, told him th
at I'm looking for Anna 
Sabol who ma rried an American, at that time student
 and they'r e ma rried and they live right here.  
They are in psychiatry ma ybe.  So, in Bellvie
w Hospital some  other doctor said, Anna I think 
they are searching for you.  She said ma ybe th
ey're some body crazy from Bellview and they 
found out my name , but they came to the restit
ution office and we me t.  They were both 
psychiatrists and their two sons came  to that peop
le that I lived there.  That's why I reme mber 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
38 
 
there was a Time Magazine and they had an article
 just  around the corner because they lived just 
around the corner.  She asked me  that she's very so
rry that she would like to help me , to give me  
anything they wanted and I said
 no.  You could have saved your fa mily and ma ybe us, but you 
asked Zigmund only to come  and leave Ruzia and he
r little boy alone and your fa mily said Shiva 
and tore his garment and he wants you to know th
at.  Then she called my sister-in-law Blanche 
how she can get me .  They tried very hard then
 I married and I said I don't want anything from 
them.  But one time I was maybe, a year a
go, that's how I find ____________ I said to Mitchell 
in New York City, you know I wonder if she is stil
l alive because she had 
a practice and this is 
the time  that we found in the telephone book 
____________.  I said it doesn't  say Doctor, so he 
said well why don't you call and ask, so he called and he spoke and they said yes, which Reml er 

and he said Doctor Remler and he said who you ar
e and he said I'll let you speak to my mother 
and that proved to me  he was the brother of Do
ctor Reml er, of her husband and I understand that 

he was killed in an accident with his younger son 
and Anna since then has passed away, but they 
have a son who is in William and Mary, a Pr
ofessor and one is a surgeon in California 
some where but I called that William and Mary and 
he told me  that do you know that brother of 
Zigmund Hiney is in Los Vegas.  S
o, see what happens after 50 years. 
Q. You recently told, and we'll do this shor
tly, your son Gary about your first ma rriage. 

A. Gary visited me  by hims el
f without the fa mily.  I don't know how the conversation went, 
but I didn't see too much of his daughter and I 
thought that Vicki herself could come  some ti me  
but she's typical New England, very
 reserved and she doesn't  feel
 comfortable to come without 
him, and I said just to hold her in my arms a
nd that's what brought out and I told him.   I as a 
mother sense that it ma de advers
e impression on him.  Why didn't you 
tell us.  I said that was a 
decision between Daddy and I and I was only ma rried
 seven months.  I don't even know if I was 
married.  It didn't make any impression.  I didn't ev
en have time to adjust myself.  The child also, 
three months, I just didn't  and I thought you should
 know.  I always thought I was the first born.  
I said you are of a lasting ma rri
age of 39 years Gary and I spent so much time with you in 
sickness and in happiness and he sa
id are you going to tell Mitchell. 
 I said, with time, with time, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0317  
39 
 
when it's going to be the proper time.  And I thin
k I will do when I visit Mitchell at the end of 
this month as I'm going to the Survivors of the Ho
locaust they are having gathering in New York 
City.  It's  not going to be easy, and this is why 
ma ybe a whole year that 
you are trying to ma ke 
contact, I didn't want to say something that it'
s not accurate, and it will take me a long time to 
return to be half norma l.  I ca
nnot ever be norma l life.  In the 
beginning we  didn't have too much, 
but then we'r e comfortable, and I still would not
 spend on me  to buy a suit
 unless I'm pressed to 
it, but I would donate $5,000 to a 
cause if it would be for a good reason.  It's hard when you eat 
dinner and reme mber my sister saying that she'
s hungry.  You don't forge t  that.  You can keep on 
the bottom s o me where in your me mory but it st
ays with you.  Any my 
mother now that I'm 
definitely over 42 and I realize that 42 is 
very young, it's a young life and Ruzia never fulfilled 
her dreams neither and my uncles and aunts.  I 
lost 58 with the imme diate fa mily not counting 
farther relatives.  _____________ lost her father even 
he obtained papers and 
went to practice in 
Warsaw as a Doctor Wos i nski.  It didn't  help
 them.  Her brother Karl, a me dical student, 
handsome a s can be, shot on the street.  Where 
do you draw the line.  My other aunt who was 
ma rried to Doctor _____________.  He was a lawyer. 
 And his daughter who was so pretty, all 
vanished.  ________________ all those people.  They'r
e justremnants of my me mory but not 
people.  I don't think that I to the very last
 da y of my life will ev
er overcome through it the 
Holocaust.  But, as my s on called me  yesterday, 
"Mother, do it.  Tell th
e one that doesn't know 
everything.  Do it.  Tell them everything.  Do 
it for us, the younger gene
ration that they cannot 
forget it.  That is should not happen again."  W
ouldn't it?   I don't know.  I am still scared.  When 
I read and I do get _______________ and the Jewish 
publication and see what's  going on on the 
campuses, what's going on in Germany.  As a ma tter of
 fact the orthopedist th
at I tried to find out 
a day that the Germany invade Poland told me  that he was to a meeting in Norway and an 

orthopedist doctor in Norway why you Americans so
 scared of Russians.  Why aren't  you scared 
of Ger mans.  I was taken then to an unde
rground you would not believ
e how much ammunition 
is there and how they greet each other.  I said
 Andy, how heil Hitler so lots of things are going 
on and people for sure are not more sy
mpathetic than the Jewish people.

because I never will come  on my own will.

Q. Ava, we have a few pictures
, if you could please identify? 
A. This is my mother.  Her first name  was Sabi
na Muller.  She was very beautiful and I lost 
her when she was 42 years of age, but that was be
fore the war taken and given to me  by an aunt 
from Warsaw.  I didn't have any pictures.  This is
 a picture that I believe it was taken while I was 
registering as a Polish girl to wo
rk in Vienna because that blouse
 was given to me  by a  friend of 
mi ne, Wa nda and that's the blouse that sustaine
d me  through the whole time  during my working 
days in Vienna.  That is a picture that I th
ink was taken while I was still working for that 
_______________ in Vienna because it's the same  blouse.  I hope that after the war I hope I 
acquire other blouse.  I'm not sure even.  This pi
cture would be really th
e first one, because after 
the war I was so eager to finish my e
ducation and there was the Academi a  ____________ and 
they took the pictur e.  Still the same  fa mous blous
e and I woul d say that that would be  the first 

one.  If they came relatively in shor ter time, it mu st
 be at that time  taken.  I came to Vienna in 
'43.  The wa r was over in '45, so it had to be at that time . 

Q. This is the name  that you took? 

A. That Rutkofska.  Yes.  I think doe
s it say Stephanie there or ma ybe not? 

Q. Ava. 

A. Ava Rutkofs a k.  We ll, maybe I dropped the St
ephanie but in my pape
rs I have Stephanie 
whoever she was. 

Q. Thank you very much. 

A. You're very welcome.  I'm glad it's over. 

 
Conclusion of Interview
